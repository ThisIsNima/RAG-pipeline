AbstractIn this chapter we provide a set of short tables of integral transforms of the functions that are either cited in the text or in most common use in mathematical, physical, and engineering applications. For exhaustive lists of integral transforms, the reader is referred to Erdélyi et al. (1954), Campbell and Foster (1948), Ditkin and Prudnikov (1965), Doetsch (1970), Marichev (1983), Debnath (1995), and Oberhettinger (1972).KeywordsDifferential EquationFourier TransformPartial Differential EquationMathematical MethodEngineering ApplicationThese keywords were added by machine and not by the authors. This process is experimental and the keywords may be updated as the learning algorithm improves.
