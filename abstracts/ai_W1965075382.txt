We are now going to put some order in our ideas and do theoretical physics. During the years 1925 to 1927, quantum mechanics took shape and accumulated successes. But three persons, and not the least, addressed the question of its structure. In Zürich there was Erwin Schrödinger, in Göttingen David Hilbert, and in Cambridge Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac.KeywordsHilbert SpaceQuantum MechanicScalar ProductState VectorComplex Vector SpaceThese keywords were added by machine and not by the authors.
