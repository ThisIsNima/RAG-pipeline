Computing in science and engineering is now ubiquitous: digital technologies underpin, accelerate, and enable new, even transformational, research in all domains. Access to an array of integrated and well-supported high-end digital services is critical for the advancement of knowledge. Driven by community needs, the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) project substantially enhances the productivity of a growing community of scholars, researchers, and engineers (collectively referred to as "scientists"' throughout this article) through access to advanced digital services that support open research. XSEDE's integrated, comprehensive suite of advanced digital services federates with other high-end facilities and with campus-based resources, serving as the foundation for a national e-science infrastructure ecosystem. XSEDE's e-science infrastructure has tremendous potential for enabling new advancements in research and education. XSEDE's vision is a world of digitally enabled scholars, researchers, and engineers participating in multidisciplinary collaborations to tackle society's grand challenges.
