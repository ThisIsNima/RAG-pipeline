The author is primarily concerned with the problem of aggregating multicriteria to form an overall decision function. He introduces a type of operator for aggregation called an ordered weighted aggregation (OWA) operator and investigates the properties of this operator. The OWA's performance is found to be between those obtained using the AND operator, which requires all criteria to be satisfied, and the OR operator, which requires at least one criteria to be satisfied.< <ETX xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">&gt;</ETX>
