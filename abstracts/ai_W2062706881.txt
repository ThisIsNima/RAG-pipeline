The fuzzy logic controller (FLC) provides a means of converting a linguistic control strategy. A survey of the FLC is presented, and a general methodology for constructing an FLC and assessing its performance is described. In particular, attention is given to fuzzification and defuzzification strategies, the derivation of the database and fuzzy control rules, the definition of fuzzy implication, and an analysis of fuzzy reasoning mechanisms.< <ETX xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">&gt;</ETX>
