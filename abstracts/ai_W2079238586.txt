It is with genuine pride and pleasure that Potomac Associates joins with The Club of Rome and the MIT research team in the publication of The Limits to Growth.We, like The Club of Rome, are a young organization, and we believe the Club's goals are very close to our own.Our purpose is to bring new ideas, new analyses, and new approaches to persistent.problems-both national and international-to the attention of all those who care about and help determine the quality and direction of our life.We are delighted therefore to be able to make this bold and impressive work available through our book program.We hope that The Limits to Growth will command critical attention and spark debate in all societies.We hope that it will encourage each reader to think through the consequences of continuing to equate growth with progress.And we hope that it will lead thoughtful men and women in all fields of endeavor to consider the need for concerted action now if we are to preserve the habitability of this planet for ourselves and our children.12
