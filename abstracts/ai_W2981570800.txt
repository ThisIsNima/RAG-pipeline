AbstractOur current picture of how matter and radiation are distributed in the Universe on a large scale is derived from a wide variety of different types of observation. In this chapter, we concentrate upon the large-scale distribution of matter and radiation in the Universe and discuss galaxies and clusters of galaxies in Chaps. 3 and 4 respectively. The observations described in this chapter provide much of the essential underpinning of modern cosmological research.KeywordsRadio SourceGalactic PlaneAngular ScaleApparent MagnitudeLocal UniverseThese keywords were added by machine and not by the authors.
