Abstract Editor's Note: John Elkington's new book, Cannibals with Forks: The Triple Bottom Line of 21st‐Century Business , has been hailed as “practical, compassionate and deeply informed, a brilliant synthesis of his genius for cutting through the thicket of tough issues–in the world of business and sustainability–and producing elegant solutions that can be applied today” (Paul Hawken). We are pleased to have the opportunity to publish a selection from this award‐winning book. In this discussion of partnerships, Elkington explores how effective, long‐term partnerships will be crucial for companies making the transition to sustainability and offers approaches and examples of keen interest. Special thanks to Capstone Publishers, U.K., for their gracious cooperation.
