Part 1 Liquid crystals - main types and properties: introduction - what is a liquid crystal? the building blocks nematics and cholesterics smectics columnar phases more on long-, quasi-long and short-range order remarkable features of liquid crystals. Part 2 Long- and short-range order in nematics: definition of an order parameter statistical theories of the nematic order phenomonological description of the nematic-isotopic mixtures. Part 3 Static distortion in a nematic single crystal: principles of the continuum theory magnetic field effects electric field effects in an insulating nematic fluctuations in the alignment hydrostatics of nematics. Part 4 Defects and textures in nematics: observations disclination lines point disclinations walls under magnetic fields umbilics surface disclinations. Part 5 Dynamical properties of nematics: the equations of nematodynamics experiments measuring the Leslie co-efficients convective instabilities under electric fields molecular motions. Part 6 Cholesterics: optical properties of an ideal helix agents influencing the pitch dynamical properties textures and defects in cholesterics. Part 7 Smectics: symmetry of the main smectic phases continuum description of smectics A and C remarks on phase and precritical phenomena.
