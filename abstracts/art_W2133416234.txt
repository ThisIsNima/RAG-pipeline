The ESH/ESC Guidelines represent the views of the ESH and ESC and were arrived at after careful consideration of the available evidence at the time they were written.Health professionals are encouraged to take them fully into account when exercising their clinical judgement.The guidelines do not, however, override the individual responsibility of health professionals to make appropriate decisions in the circumstances of the individual patients, in consultation with that patient, and where appropriate and necessary the patient's guardian or carer.It is also the health professional's responsibility to verify the rules and regulations applicable to drugs and devices at the time of prescription.
