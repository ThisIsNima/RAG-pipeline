A visual analogue scale has been constructed to allow relatives and professionals to rate the behaviour of elderly patients. The scale has been shown to have good inter-rater reliability, test-retest reliability and validity. It is suggested that the scale can provide a quick and convenient initial assessment of the patient either at home or in hospital, and possibly also a measure of change.
