Presently in its second edition, "At Risk" stands as a primary text in risk and vulnerability studies. The authors focus on the political and economic causes of disaster, arguing that vulnerability is at the foundation of risks and recovery practices. Through focusing on natural hazards, such as floods, earthquakes, and volcanoes, "At Risk" demonstrates how social groups with little economic or political power are the most at risk during times of disaster. The author's "Pressure and Release" model for risk and hazard progression is an interesting addition to disaster scholarship.
