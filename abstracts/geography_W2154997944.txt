The Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living (ADL), now in frequent use in rehabilitation settings, has application for prevention of disability and maintenance of rehabilitation gains in the aging person in all settings. Since the Index is sensitive to changes in meaningful self-care functions, uses well-defined criteria, and can be broadly taught to non-professionals, it has considerable practical value as a longitudinal measure of change and predictor of adaptive capacity in terms of community residences and congregate living facilities.
