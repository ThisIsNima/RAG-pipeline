Summary Haplotype networks are an intuitive method for visualising relationships between individual genotypes at the population level. Here, we present popart , an integrated software package that provides a comprehensive implementation of haplotype network methods, phylogeographic visualisation tools and standard statistical tests, together with publication‐ready figure production. popart also provides a platform for the implementation and distribution of new network‐based methods – we describe one such new method, integer neighbour‐joining . The software is open source and freely available for all major operating systems.
