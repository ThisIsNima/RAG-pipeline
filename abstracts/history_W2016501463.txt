In preparing this edition, Dreyfus and Rabinow added not only the interview with Foucalt - On the Genealogy of Ethics: An Overview of Work in Progress - but also a new chapter on the books Foucalt was working on at the time: two more planned volumes of The History of Sexuality and a third book, Le Souci de soi, that was to analyze the great attention paid by the ancient world to the care of the self. Foucault himself wrote at the time that this book presents a very clear and intelligent analysis of the work that I have attempted to do. Resolving many misunderstandings, it offers an accurate, synthetic view... Beyond its particular goal, I believe this work opens new horizons for the relations between American and European thought.
