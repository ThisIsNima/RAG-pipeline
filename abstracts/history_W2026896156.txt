Next-Generation Biogeography In 1876, Alfred Russel Wallace mapped the zoogeographical regions of the world, based on the distributions and taxonomic relationships of broadly defined mammalian families. Wallace's classification of zoogeographical regions became a cornerstone of modern biogeography and a reference for a wide variety of biological disciplines, including global biodiversity and conservation sciences. Holt et al. (p. 74 , published online 20 December) present a next-generation map of wallacean zoogeographic regions, incorporating phylogenetic data on &gt;20,000 vertebrate species to discern and characterize their natural biogeographic patterns.
