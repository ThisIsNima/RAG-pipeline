These features reflect the geologic history of the mineral, especially the relevant episode(s) of magmatic or metamorphic crystallization (and recrystallization), strain imposed both by external forces and by internal volume expansion caused by metamictization, and chemical alteration. The paper presents a selection of both the most typical, but also of the less common, features seen in zircon, categorized according to the different geological processes responsible for their formation. The atlas is intended as a general guide for the interpretation of zircon characteristics, and of related...
