The history of research in grammaticalizationAs far as I can see, it was Antoine Meillet (1912) who coined the term "grammaticalization" and first applied it to the concept for which it is still used today.We will return to him in a moment.The concept itself, however, and the ideas behind it, are considerably older.The idea that grammatical formatives evolve from lexemes, that affixes come from free forms, was already expounded by the French philosopher Étienne Bonnot de Condillac.In his work Essai sur l'origine des connaissances humaines (1746), he explained the personal endings of the verb through agglutination of personal pronouns and maintained that verbal tense came from the coalescence of a temporal adverb with the stem.Again, John Horne Tooke, in his etymological work Ἔπεα πτερόεντα or the diversions of Purley (vol.I: 1786, vol.II: 1805), claimed that prepositions derive from nouns or verbs. 1 We shall see in Chapter 1 that all such processes do, in fact, occur, though not necessarily in the specific cases which these authors had in mind.Condillac and Horne Tooke were certainly only forerunners to the first evolutive typologists, notably August Wilhelm von Schlegel and Wilhelm von Humboldt.In his Observations sur la langue et la littérature provençales (1818), Schlegel deals extensively with the renewal of Latin synthetic morphology by Romance analytic morphology.About the formation of the latter, he writes: C'est une invention en quelque façon négative, que celle qui a produit les grammaires analytiques, et la méthode uniformément suivie à cet égard peut se réduire à un seul principe.On dépouille certains mots de leur énergie significative, on ne leur laisse qu'une valeur nominale, pour leur donner un cours plus général et les faire entrer dans la partie élémentaire de la langue.Ces mots deviennent une espèce de papier-monnaie destiné à faciliter la circulation.(1818: 28) This is followed by a series of Latin-Romance examples of different kinds, including the development of articles, auxiliaries and indefinite pronouns, which 1
