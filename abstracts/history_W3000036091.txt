Objective To develop an evidence‐based guideline for the comprehensive management of osteoarthritis ( OA ) as a collaboration between the American College of Rheumatology ( ACR ) and the Arthritis Foundation, updating the 2012 ACR recommendations for the management of hand, hip, and knee OA . Methods We identified clinically relevant population, intervention, comparator, outcomes questions and critical outcomes in OA . A Literature Review Team performed a systematic literature review to summarize evidence supporting the benefits and harms of available educational, behavioral, psychosocial, physical, mind‐body, and pharmacologic therapies for OA . Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology was used to rate the quality of the evidence. A Voting Panel, including rheumatologists, an internist, physical and occupational therapists, and patients, achieved consensus on the recommendations. Results Based on the available evidence, either strong or conditional recommendations were made for or against the approaches evaluated. Strong recommendations were made for exercise, weight loss in patients with knee and/or hip OA who are overweight or obese, self‐efficacy and self‐management programs, tai chi, cane use, hand orthoses for first carpometacarpal ( CMC ) joint OA , tibiofemoral bracing for tibiofemoral knee OA , topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs ( NSAID s) for knee OA , oral NSAID s, and intraarticular glucocorticoid injections for knee OA . Conditional recommendations were made for balance exercises, yoga, cognitive behavioral therapy, kinesiotaping for first CMC OA , orthoses for hand joints other than the first CMC joint, patellofemoral bracing for patellofemoral knee OA , acupuncture, thermal modalities, radiofrequency ablation for knee OA , topical NSAID s, intraarticular steroid injections and chondroitin sulfate for hand OA , topical capsaicin for knee OA , acetaminophen, duloxetine, and tramadol. Conclusion This guideline provides direction for clinicians and patients making treatment decisions for the management of OA . Clinicians and patients should engage in shared decision‐making that accounts for patients’ values, preferences, and comorbidities. These recommendations should not be used to limit or deny access to therapies.
