The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission produced the most complete, highest‐resolution digital elevation model of the Earth. The project was a joint endeavor of NASA, the National Geospatial‐Intelligence Agency, and the German and Italian Space Agencies and flew in February 2000. It used dual radar antennas to acquire interferometric radar data, processed to digital topographic data at 1 arc sec resolution. Details of the development, flight operations, data processing, and products are provided for users of this revolutionary data set.
