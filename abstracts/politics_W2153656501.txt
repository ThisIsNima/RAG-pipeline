The Theory of Social and Economic Organization grew out of Weber’s philosophical inquiries into the nature of authority and how it is transmitted. He identified three types of authority: the charismatic, based on the individual qualities of a leader and reverence for them among his or her followers; the traditional, based on custom and usage; and the rational-legal, based on the rule of objective law.
