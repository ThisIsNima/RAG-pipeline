Clinical uses of cellular communication Exosomes are a type of extracellular vesicle that contain constituents (protein, DNA, and RNA) of the cells that secrete them. They are taken up by distant cells, where they can affect cell function and behavior. Intercellular communication through exosomes seems to be involved in the pathogenesis of various disorders, including cancer, neurodegeneration, and inflammatory diseases. In a Review, Kalluri and LeBleu discuss the biogenesis and function of exosomes in disease, highlighting areas where more research is needed. They also discuss the potential clinical applications of exosome profiling for diagnostics and exosome-mediated delivery of therapeutics to target disease cells. Science , this issue p. eaau6977
