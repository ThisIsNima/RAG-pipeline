From Publisher:
A Question of Identity
Life on Screen is a fascinating and wide-ranging investigation of impact of computers and networking on society, peoples' perceptions of themselves, and individual's relationship to machines. Sherry Turkle, a Professor of Sociology of Science at MIT and a licensed psychologist, uses Internet MUDs (multi-user domains, or in older gaming parlance multi-user dungeons) as a launching pad for explorations of software design, user interfaces, simulation, artificial intelligence, artificial life, agents, bots, virtual reality, and the on-line way of life. 
Turkle's discussion of postmodernism is particularly enlightening. She shows how postmodern concepts in art, architecture, and ethics are related to concrete topics much closer to home, for example AI research (Minsky's Society of Mind) and even MUDs (exemplified by students with X-window terminals who are doing homework in one window and simultaneously playing out several different roles in same MUD in other windows). Those of you who have (like me) been turned off by shallow, pretentious, meaningless paintings and sculptures that litter our museums of modern art may have a different perspective after hearing what Turkle has to say. 
This is a psychoanalytical book, not a technical one. However, software developers and engineers will find it highly accessible because of depth of author's technical understanding and credibility. Unlike most other authors in this genre, Turkle does not constantly jar technically-literate reader with blatant errors or bogus assertions about how things work. Although I personally don't have time or patience for MUDs,view most of AI as snake-oil, and abhor postmodern architecture, I thought time spent reading this book was an extremely good investment.
