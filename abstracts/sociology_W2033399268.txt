Upon its initial publication, many reviewers dubbed Dan C. Lortie's Schoolteacher the best social portrait of the profession since Willard Waller's The Sociology of Teaching. This new printing of Lortie's classic - including a new preface bringing the author's observations up to date - is an essential view into the world and culture of a vitally important profession.
