Judging from the frequent occurrence of such words as power, influence, dominance and submission, status and authority, the importance of power is widely recognized, yet considerable confusion exists concerning these concepts. The process of cost reduction in power-dependence relations shows itself in many varied forms. Cost reduction is a process involving change in values which reduces the pains incurred in meeting the demands of a powerful other. The costs associated with alternatives must be included in any assessment of dependency. The chapter aims to construct a simple theory of the power aspects of social relations. It focuses on the characteristics of the relationship as such, with little or no regard for particular features of the persons or groups engaged in such relations. Social relations commonly entail ties of mutual dependence between the parties. The notion of reciprocity in power-dependency relations raises the question of equality or inequality of power in the relation.
