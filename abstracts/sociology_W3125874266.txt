The book «Reassembling the Social» presents the fundamental thoughts of a leading social theorist on whata society is and what the word «social» actually means. According to the author «the social», understood asa separate domain or a kind of material, no longer contributes to the progress of social sciences. The notion of «the social» must be redefined from «assemblages» of nature. The presented sociology of associations isknown as actor-network theory to which this book serves as an essential guide, giving readers the opportunityto become acquainted with the thinking of its most influential proponent. The journal «Economic Sociology» publishes the Introduction to the book — «How to Resume the Taskof Tracing Associations» — which indicates the main differences between «sociology of associations» and«sociology of the social». Additionally, it focuses on key tasks and theoretical sources for the sociology ofassociations, including, most importantly; the sociology of Gabriel Tarde.
