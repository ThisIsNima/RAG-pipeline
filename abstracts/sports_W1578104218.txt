KEGG (http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/) is a suite of databases and associated software for understanding and simulating higher-order functional behaviours of the cell or the organism from its genome information. First, KEGG computerizes data and knowledge on protein interaction networks (PATHWAY database) and chemical reactions (LIGAND database) that are responsible for various cellular processes. Second, KEGG attempts to reconstruct protein interaction networks for all organisms whose genomes are completely sequenced (GENES and SSDB databases). Third, KEGG can be utilized as reference knowledge for functional genomics (EXPRESSION database) and proteomics (BRITE database) experiments. I will review the current status of KEGG and report on new developments in graph representation and graph computations.
