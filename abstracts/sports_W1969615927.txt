Sclerosing pancreatitis is a unique form of pancreatitis that is characterized by irregular narrowing of the main pancreatic duct, lymphoplasmacytic inflammation of the pancreas, and hypergammaglobulinemia and that responds to glucocorticoid treatment. Preliminary studies suggested that serum IgG4 concentrations are elevated in this disease but not in other diseases of the pancreas or biliary tract.
