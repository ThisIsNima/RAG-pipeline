We propose a method for three-dimensional microfabrication with photopolymerization stimulated by two-photon absorption with a pulsed infrared laser. An experimental system for the microfabrication has been developed with a Ti:sapphire laser whose oscillating wavelength and pulse width are 790 nm and 200 fs, respectively. The usefulness of the proposed method has been verified by fabrication of several kinds of microstructure by use of a resin consisting of photoinitiators, urethane acrylate monomers, and urethane acrylate oligomers.
