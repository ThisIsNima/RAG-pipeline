Abstract Although silicon (Si) has not been recognized as an essential element for plant growth, the beneficial effects of Si have been observed in a wide variety of plant species. The beneficial effects of Si are usually expressed more clearly in Si-accumulating plants under various abiotic and biotic stress conditions. Silicon is effective in controlling various pests and diseases caused by both fungi and bacteria in different plant species. Silicon also exerts alleviative effects on various abiotic stresses including salt stress, metal toxicity, drought stress, radiation damage, nutrient imbalance, high temperature, freezing and so on. These beneficial effects are mainly attributed to the high accumulation of silica on the tissue stirface although other mechanisms have also been proposed. To obtain plants resistant to multiple stresses, genetic modification of the root ability to take up Si has been proposed. In this review, the role of Si in conferring resistance to mutiple stresses is described.
