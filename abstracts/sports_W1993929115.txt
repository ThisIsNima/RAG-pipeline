A general approach to viable modified $f(R)$ gravity is developed in both the Jordan and the Einstein frames. A class of exponential, realistic modified gravities is introduced and investigated with care. Special focus is made on step-class models, most promising from the phenomenological viewpoint and which provide a natural way to classify all viable modified gravities. One- and two-step models are explicitly considered, but the analysis is extensible to $N$-step models. Both inflation in the early universe and the onset of recent accelerated expansion arise in these models in a natural, unified way. Moreover, it is demonstrated that models in this category easily pass all local tests, including stability of spherical body solution, nonviolation of Newton's law, and generation of a very heavy positive mass for the additional scalar degree of freedom.
