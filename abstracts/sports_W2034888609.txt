Abstract Carbon-doped TiO2 powders in an anatase phase colored yellow were fabricated by oxidative annealing of TiC. Carbons were located at oxygen sites. The carbon substitution caused the absorbance edge of TiO2 to be shifted to the higher wavelength region. Carbon-doped TiO2 showed photocatalytic activities for the decomposition of IPA to CO2 via acetone under visible light (400–530 nm) irradiation.
