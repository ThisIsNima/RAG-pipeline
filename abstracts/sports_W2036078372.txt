The development of the ordered channel array in the anodic porous alumina was initiated by the textured pattern of the surface made by the molding process, and growth of an almost defect-free channel array can be achieved throughout the textured area. The long-range-ordered channel array with dimensions on the order of millimeters with a channel density of 1010 cm−2 was obtained, and the aspect ratio was over 150. The master for molding could be used many times, which makes it possible to overcome problems in the conventional nanolithographic technique, such as low through-put and high cost.
