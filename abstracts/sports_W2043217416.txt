Overall water splitting to form hydrogen and oxygen over a heterogeneous photocatalyst using solar energy is a promising process for clean and recyclable hydrogen production in large-scale. In recent years, numerous attempts have been made for the development of photocatalysts that work under visible-light irradiation to efficiently utilize solar energy. This article presents recent research progress in the development of visible-light-driven photocatalysts, focusing on the refinement of non-oxide-type photocatalysts such as (oxy)nitrides and oxysulfides.
