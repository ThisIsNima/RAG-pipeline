Various superhydrophobic films having different surface roughnesses were prepared, and the relationships between the sliding angle, the contact angle, and the surface structure were investigated. In the highly hydrophobic region, the sliding angles of water droplets decreased with increasing contact angles. Microstructural observation revealed that surface structures that can trap air are important for the preparation of low-sliding-angle surfaces. We have also derived an equation that describes the relationship between sliding angles and contact angles on superhydrophobic surfaces with roughness. The results calculated on the basis of this equation agreed well with the experimental ones. Moreover, we have successfully prepared a transparent superhydrophobic film whose sliding angle is ∼1° for a 7 mg water droplet. On this film, there was almost no resistance to the sliding of water droplets. The film obtained satisfies the requirements of superhydrophobicity, transparency, and a low water sliding angle.
