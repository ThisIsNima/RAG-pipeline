The inverse process of the spin-Hall effect (ISHE), conversion of a spin current into an electric current, was observed at room temperature. A pure spin current was injected into a Pt thin film using spin pumping, and it was observed to generate electromotive force transverse to the spin current. By changing the spin-current polarization direction, the magnitude of this electromotive force varies critically, consistent with the prediction of ISHE.
