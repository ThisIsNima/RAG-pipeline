The "accuracy paradigm" for the study of personality judgment provides an important, new complement to the "error paradigm" that dominated this area of research for almost 2 decades.The present article introduces a specific approach within the accuracy paradigm called the Realistic Accuracy Model (RAM).RAM begins with the assumption that personality traits are real attributes of individuals.This assumption entails the use of a broad array of criteria for the evaluation of personality judgment and leads to a model that describes accuracy as a function of the availability, detection, and utilization of relevant behavioral cues.RAM provides a common explanation for basic moderators of accuracy, sheds light on how these moderators interact, and outlines a research agenda that includes the reintegration of the study of error with the study of accuracy.Believe truth!Shun error!-these, we see, are two materially different laws; and by choosing between them we may end by coloring differently our whole intellectual life.(James, 1897(James, /1915) ) Judgments of personality are attempts to identify the psychological properties of people, such as personality traits, that help to explain what they have done in the past and to predict what they will do in the future (Funder, 1991).For example, one person might judge the degree to which another is critical, dependable, or energetic.The judgment might be used to explain why he or she insulted an acquaintance or to predict whether he or she will work at a job reliably and well.Judgments like these are not rare in the lab or in daily life and frequently have been the focus of psychological research.For almost two decades, the dominant, implicit motto of this research surely has been "Shun error!"The detection of error has constituted an important approach toward the study of how people judge each others' personalities, as well as of human judgment more generally (e.g., Kahneman & Tversky, 1973;Ross & Nisbett, 1991).A prolific, ingenious, and influential program of research has exhaustively detailed characteristic shortcomings of human judgment (cf.Ross, 1977, and Nisbett &Ross, 1980), generated suggestions about how to mitigate some of these shortcomings, and yielded insights into processes or "heuristics" of human judgment that can produce error (Funder, 1987;Jones, 1985).Still, successful as it has been, the "error paradigm" can tell no more than half of the story.The avoidance of error is not
