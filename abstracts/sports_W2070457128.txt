Continuous porous silica rods consisting of a mesoporous (pore size, 14 or 25 nm) silica skeleton of ∼1 μm size and through-pores of ∼1.7 μm were prepared and derivatized to C18 phase by on-column reaction with octadecyldimethyl-(N,N-diethylamino)silane. The C18 silica rods gave plate heights of 10−20 μm for aromatic hydrocarbons in 80% methanol and 20−40 μm for insulin in acetonitrile−water mixtures in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid. The performance of the silica rods was much better at a high flow rate than that of conventional columns packed with 5 μm C18 silica particles having 12 and 30 nm pores, especially for high molecular weight species.
