A new GaAs-based diluted magnetic semiconductor, (Ga,Mn)As, was prepared by molecular beam epitaxy. The lattice constant of (Ga,Mn)As films was determined by x-ray diffraction and shown to increase with the increase of Mn composition, x. Well-aligned in-plane ferromagnetic order was observed by magnetization measurements. Magnetotransport measurements revealed the occurrence of anomalous Hall effect in the (Ga,Mn)As layer.
