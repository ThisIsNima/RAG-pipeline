The oxidation power of the TiO2-xNx powders with low nitrogen concentrations (<0.02) was evaluated by the decomposition of gaseous 2-propanol (IPA) under the same absorbed photon number, 1.4 × 1014 quanta·cm-2·s-1, of visible (Vis) or ultraviolet (UV) light. Regardless of the x value, the quantum yield values from irradiating with Vis light was lower than with UV light, which suggests that the isolated narrow band formed above the valence band is responsible for the Vis light response in the present nitrogen doped TiO2. In addition, increasing the nitrogen concentration when irradiating with UV light lowered the quantum yields, indicating that the doping sites could also serve as recombination sites.
