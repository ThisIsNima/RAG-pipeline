We first succeeded in synthesizing ionic liquids from 20 natural amino acids. Amino acid ionic liquids dissolved native amino acids, despite water-free conditions. Furthermore, these ionic liquids are soluble in various organic solvents, such as chloroform. Effects of acidity, hydrogen bonding ability, and steric factors on the properties of these ionic liquids were analyzed as the function of side groups.
