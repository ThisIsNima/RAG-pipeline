The first resolution of enantiomers was performed 150 years ago-mechanically. Today a powerful method for carrying out this task is HPLC on polysaccharide derivatives as chiral stationary phases. Most racemates, from an analytical to a preparative scale, now appear to be resolved by this technique. As an example, the chromatogram for the enantiomeric resolution of a fullerene derivative is shown on the right.
