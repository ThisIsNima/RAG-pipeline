Abstract Fluorine has come to be recognized as a key element in materials science: in heat‐transfer agents, liquid crystals, dyes, surfactants, plastics, elastomers, membranes, and other materials. Furthermore, many fluorine‐containing biologically active agents are finding applications as pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Progress in synthetic fluorine chemistry has been critical to the development of these fields and has led to the invention of many novel fluorinated molecules as future drugs and materials. As a result of the electronic effects of fluorine substituents, fluorinated substrates and reagents often exhibit unusual and unique chemical properties, which often make them incompatible with established synthetic methods. Thus, the problem of how to control the unusual properties of compounds with fluorine substituents deserves much attention, so as to promote the design of facile, efficient, and environmentally benign methods for the synthesis of valuable organofluorine targets.
