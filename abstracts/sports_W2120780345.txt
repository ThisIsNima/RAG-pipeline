Abstract Hydrogen bond catalysis and Brønsted acid catalysis are rapidly growing areas in organocatalysis. A number of chiral acid catalysts has been developed recently. Recent progress in the chiral Brønsted acid catalysis has been reviewed with a focus being placed on thiourea, TADDOL, and phosphoric acids. 1 Introduction 2 Hydrogen Bond Catalysis 2.1 Monofunctional Thiourea Catalysts 2.2 Bifunctional Thiourea Catalysts 2.3 TADDOL Derivatives 2.4 BINOL Derivatives 3 Brønsted Acid Catalysis 3.1 Ammonium Salts 3.2 Phosphoric Acids 4 Conclusion
