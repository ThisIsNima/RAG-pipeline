Recently, nanocellulose and its applications gain high attraction in both research and industrial areas due to its attractive properties such as excellent mechanical properties, high surface area, rich hydroxyl groups for modification, and natural properties with 100% environmental friendliness. In this review, the background of nanocellulose originated from lignocellulosic biomass and the typical extraction methods and general applications are summarized, in which the nanocellulose extraction methods related to ball milling are mainly introduced. Also, an outlook on its future is given. It is expected to provide guidance on the effective extraction of nanocellulose from biomass and its most possible applications in the future.
