Abstract 
 
Conventionally, engineers have employed rigid materials to fabricate 
precise, predictable robotic systems, which are easily modeled as rigid 
members connected at discrete joints. Natural systems, however, often 
match or exceed the performance of robotic systems with deformable 
bodies. Cephalopods, for example, achieve amazing feats of manipulation 
and locomotion without a skeleton; even vertebrates like humans achieve 
dynamic gaits by storing elastic energy in their compliant bones and soft 
tissues. Inspired by nature, engineers have begun to explore the design and 
control of soft-bodied robots composed of compliant materials. This Review 
discusses recent developments in the emerging field of soft robotics. 
Introduction 
Biology has long been a source of inspiration for engineers making ever-more capable machines1. 
Softness and body compliance are salient features often exploited by biological systems, which 
tend to seek simplicity and exhibit reduced complexity in their interactions with their 
environment2. Several of the lessons learned from studying biological systems are now 
culminating in the definition of a new class of machine we, and others, refer to as soft 
robots3, 4, 5, 6. Traditional, rigid-bodied robots are used today extensively in manufacturing and 
can be specifically programmed to perform a single task efficiently, but often with limited 
adaptability. Because they are built of rigid links and joints, they are unsafe for interaction with 
human beings. A common practice is to separate human and robotic workspaces in factories to 
mitigate safety concerns. The lack of compliance in conventional actuation mechanisms is part of 
this problem. Soft robots provide an opportunity to bridge the gap between machines and people. 
In contrast to hard bodied robots, soft robots have bodies made out of intrinsically soft and/or 
extensible materials (e.g. silicone rubbers) that can deform and absorb much of the energy arising 
from a collision. Soft robots have a continuously deformable structure with muscle-like actuation 
that emulates biological systems and results in a relatively large number of degrees of freedom as 
compared to their hard-bodied counterparts. Soft robots (Fig. 1) have the potential to exhibit 
unprecedented adaptation, sensitivity, and agility. Soft bodied robots promise to 1) Move with the 
ability to bend and twist with high curvatures and thus can be used in confined spaces7; 2) 
Deform their bodies in a continuous way and thus achieve motions that emulate biology8; 3) 
Adapt their shape to the environment employing compliant motion and thus manipulate objects9, 
or move on rough terrain and exhibit resilience10; 4) Execute rapid, agile maneuvers, such as the 
escape maneuver in fish11.

The key challenge for creating soft machines that achieve their full potential is the 
development of controllable soft bodies using materials that integrate sensors, actuators, and 
computation, that together enable the body to deliver the desired behavior. Traditional 
approaches to robot control assume rigidity in the linkage structure of the robot and are a poor fit 
for controlling soft bodies, thus new soft materials require new algorithms. 
What is soft?  
“Soft” refers to the body of the robot. Soft materials are the key enablers for creating soft robot 
bodies. While Young’s Modulus is only defined for homogeneous, prismatic bars that are subject 
to axial loading and small deformations, it is nonetheless a useful measure of the rigidity of 
materials used in the fabrication of robotic systems5. Materials traditionally used in robotics (e.g. 
metals, hard plastics), have moduli on the order of 109–1012 Pa, whereas natural organisms are 
often composed of materials (e.g. skin, muscle tissue) with moduli on the order of 104–109 Pa 
(i.e. orders of magnitude lower than their engineered counterparts, see Fig. 2). We define soft 
robots as systems capable of autonomous behavior that are primarily composed of materials with 
moduli in the range of the moduli of soft biological materials. 
Advantages of using materials with compliance similar to soft biological materials include a 
significant reduction in the harm that could be inadvertently caused by robotic systems (as has 
been demonstrated for rigid robots with compliant joints12), increasing their potential for 
interaction with humans. Compliant materials also adapt more readily to various objects, 
simplifying tasks like grasping13, and can also lead to improved mobility over soft substrates14.  
For the body of a soft robot to achieve its potential, facilities for sensing, actuation, 
computation, power storage, and communication must be embedded in the soft material, resulting 
in smart materials. Additionally, algorithms that drive the body to deliver desired behaviors are 
required. These algorithms implement impedance matching to the structure of the body. This 
tight coupling between body and brain allows us to think about soft bodied systems as machines 
with mechanical intelligence, where the body can be viewed to augment the brain with 
morphological computation15, 16. This ability of the body to perform computation simplifies the 
control algorithms in many situations, blurring the line between the body and the brain. However, 
soft robots (like soft organisms) require control algorithms, which (at least for the foreseeable 
futures) will run on some sort of computing hardware. While both body and brain must be 
considered in concert, the challenges involved are distinct enough that we find it useful to 
organize them here into separate sections. 
In the following three sections we review recent developments in the field of soft robotics as 
they pertain to design and fabrication, computation and control, and systems and applications. 
We then conclude with a discussion of persistent challenges facing soft robotics, and suggest 
areas where we see the greatest potential for societal impact. 
Design and Fabrication 
A robot is classified as hard or soft on the basis of the compliance of its underlying materials3. 
Soft robots are capable of continuum deformations, but not all continuum robots are soft. For 
example, the robotic elephant trunk manipulator17 is a discrete hyper-redundant continuum robot 
composed of rigid materials; the articulated catheter robot18 is an example of hard continuum 
robot; OctArm19 (Fig. 3b) is an example of semi-soft continuum robot; while the caterpillar 
robot20 (Fig. 1a) and the rolling belt robot21 are examples of soft continuum robots. These soft

----- Page 4 (native) -----
machines have modular bodies consisting of soft rubber segments, which can be composed 
serially or in parallel to create complex morphologies. The body of a soft robot may consist of 
multiple materials with different stiffness properties22, 11. A soft robot encases in a soft body all 
the sub-systems of a conventional robot: an actuation system, a perception system, driving 
electronics, and a computation system, with corresponding power sources. Technological 
advances in soft materials and subsystems compatible with the soft body enable the autonomous 
function of the soft robot. The rest of this section describes recent progress in developing sub-
systems for soft robots. With this range of components, design tools are used to create the 
topology of the robot body along with the placement of its functional components. Given the 
design roadmap, the robot is ready to be fabricated. 
Actuation 
The segments of a soft robot are usually actuated in one of two ways (See Fig. 4): 1) Variable 
length tendons (in the form of tension cables23 or shape memory alloy actuators24) may be 
embedded in soft segments, to achieve, for example, robotic octopus arms (Fig. 3f). 2) In another 
common approach, pneumatic actuation is used to inflate channels in a soft material and cause a 
desired deformation. Pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs), also known as McKibben actuators, 
are examples of compliant linear soft actuators composed of elastomer tubes in fiber sleeves25, 26. 
Fluidic elastomer actuators (FEAs) are a new type of highly extensible and adaptable, low-power 
soft actuator. FEAs comprise synthetic elastomer films operated by the expansion of embedded 
channels under pressure. Once pressurized, the actuator will keep its position with little or no 
additional energy consumption. FEAs can be operated pneumatically27, 28, 29, 30, 10 or 
hydraulically31, 32. Given a small number of options for pressurized working fluid generation, and 
a significant difference between the time constants for the generators and actuators, pressure 
regulating components such as regulators and valves are necessary. Regardless of the actuation 
method, soft actuators are frequently arranged in a biologically inspired agonist-antagonist 
arrangement (like muscles) to allow bi-directional actuation. Another benefit of this arrangement 
is that co-contraction of muscle pairs leads to adaptable compliance.  
The design and actuation of soft robotic systems dates back to at least 1992 when a team 
demonstrated the impressive capabilities of soft, flexible microactuators27 (Fig. 3a). This work 
demonstrated the approach of pneumatic actuation of robotic elements composed of elastomer. In 
this approach, a fluid (usually air) is used to inflate channels in the elastomer, while some 
asymmetry in the design or constituent materials causes the component to actuate (move) in a 
desired way (see Fig. 4). The resulting continuous, adaptive motions can appear surprisingly 
lifelike. Other groups29,33-35 (Fig. 1b, c) used soft lithography techniques adapted from 
microfluidics, as well as soft composite materials composed of various silicone polymers and 
elastomers at times embedded with paper or cloth, to design and fabricate pneumatically actuated 
soft systems. One challenge with these designs based on pneumatic networks (also referred to as 
pneu-nets) is that the high strains required for actuation can lead to slow actuation rates and 
rupture failures. A slightly more complex design for pneumatically actuated elastomeric soft 
robots reduced the material strain required for actuation36, and allowed the untethered walking of 
a large, soft robot10. Soft-lithography fabrication approaches typically use a layer of stiffer rubber 
or elastomer sometimes with paper, fabric, or a plastic film embedded to achieve asymmetric 
strain for actuation. An alternative approach is to augment all elastomeric elements with flexible 
fibers, which limit the stress taken up by the elastomer during pneumatic actuation. The result is 
soft actuators with reduced extensibility and flexibility, but the ability to withstand higher

----- Page 5 (native) -----
actuation pressures, and hence apply larger forces. Using complex molding and/or freeform 
fabrication techniques, it is possible to embed fibers directly into pneumatic elastomeric actuators 
to achieve agile motions based on bending27, 13, 37. 
While most soft robot prototypes have used pneumatic or hydraulic actuation, a great deal of 
research has focused on the development of electrically activated soft actuators composed of 
electroactive polymers (EAPs)38, 39, which have also led to prototype systems22. Since energy is 
typically most readily stored in electrical form, and computation is usually done on electronic 
circuits, it may be more efficient to directly use electrical potential to actuate soft robots. Types 
of EAPs include Dielectric EAPs, ferroelectric polymers, electrostrictive graft polymers, liquid 
crystal polymers, ionic EAPs, electrorheological fluids, ionic polymer-metal composites, and 
stimuli-responsive gels. Since a detailed discussion is beyond the scope of this review, we refer 
the reader to refs 38, 39 for details. In general, fabrication, performance, and long-term stability 
are active areas of research in EAPs.  
Instead of designing the stiffness of robotic systems by tuning their constituent materials, 
another line of soft robotics research has sought to control material stiffness on-the-fly. One 
approach is to embed or encase soft materials with stiffer materials such as wax40 or metal41, 
which can be softened thermally. Embedded heaters can thus be used to adjust the structure’s 
effective stiffness and allow for compliant behavior or actuated repositioning. Similarly, 
isothermal phase change caused by particle jamming has also been explored as a method of 
adjusting a soft robot’s rigidity for actuation42, 43 (Fig. 1f), or even for grasping an impressive 
array of objects44 (Fig. 3c).  
Stretchable Electronics 
To date, most integrated soft robotics systems have relied on traditional, rigid electronics to store 
the control algorithms and connect to the systems’ actuators, sensors, and power sources. 
However, there has recently been a great effort in the area of soft and stretchable 
electronics45, 46, 47. A full discussion of this area is beyond the scope of the current review, 
however as the field of soft/stretchable electronics matures, we expect greater integration with 
soft robots, resulting in completely soft prototypes. 
Sensing 
The compliance and morphology of soft robots precludes the use of many traditional sensors 
including encoders, metal or semiconductor strain gages, or inertial measurement units (IMUs). 
While flexible-bending sensors based on piezoelectric polymers are available as commercial 
products, these may not be appropriate due to the need for all elements of the system to be both 
bendable and stretchable. Soft, stretchable electronics may enable new sensing modalities48, 49. 
The basis of proprioceptive sensors for a soft robot is usually either non-contact sensors or very 
low modulus elastomers combined with liquid-phase materials. Since soft robots are actuated by 
generating curvatures, proprioception relies on curvature sensors. The low modulus of proposed 
elastomer sensors (which have characteristic moduli in the range of 105-106 Pa) impart minimal 
change on the impedance of the underlying structures. These sensors generally have layered 
structures, where multiple thin elastomer layers are patterned with microfluidic channels by soft 
lithography. The channels are subsequently filled with a liquid conductor (e.g. gallium-containing 
alloys such as eutectic gallium-indium or eGaIn). With layered channel geometries, it is possible 
to tailor sensors for measuring various strains including tensile, shear50, or curvature51. To

----- Page 6 (native) -----
address the fabrication challenges involved with injecting complex channel networks with liquid 
conductor, recent work has investigated mask deposition of the conductor52, or direct 3D printing 
of conductive material53. Alternatively, exteroceptive sensing may be used to measure the 
curvatures of a soft robot’s body segments in real time30. To expand the applications of soft 
robotics, compatible chemical and biological sensors54 may be used to sense environmental 
signals. Such sensors may be more compatible with soft robots than the optical and audio 
recorders typically used in robotics. 
Power Sources 
A big challenge for soft robots is stretchable, portable power sources for actuation. For pneumatic 
actuators, existing fluidic power sources are not soft and are usually big and bulky. Current off-
the-shelf pressure sources are generally limited to compressors or pumps and compressed air 
cylinders55. If we draw an analogy to electrical systems, compressors are similar to generators as 
they convert electrical energy into mechanical energy, and compressed gas cylinders are similar 
to capacitors as they store a pressurized fluid in a certain volume to be discharged when required. 
Miniature compressors use valuable electrical energy inefficiently, and cylinders in useful form 
factors do not offer longevity. What has been missing for fluidic systems is the equivalent of a 
battery, where a chemical reaction generates the necessary energy for actuation using a fuel. The 
chemically operated portable pressure source, or pneumatic battery28 (Fig. 1g) generates 
pressurized gas using a hydrogen peroxide monopropellant56. Combustible fuels are another 
promising high energy density chemical fuel source57, 58. 
Electrically powered actuators (as well as the electrical controllers for pneumatic systems) 
require soft, flexible, lightweight electrical power sources59. As with soft electronics, this is an 
active area of research. Recent promising developments include graphene60, organic polymer61, 
embedded conductive fabric62 based batteries.  
Design 
Existing soft robotic systems have typically been designed with traditional 3D computer-aided 
design (CAD) software. However, today’s CAD software was not created with freeform 3D 
fabrication processes in mind, and does not easily accommodate the complex non-homogenous 
3D designs, which may be desired for soft robotics. This has led researchers to either rely on 
relatively simple “2.5-D” layered designs, or come up with customized approaches to the design 
and fabrication of each system, typically based on commercial 3D molding techniques58, 11. 
Following an alternative approach, researchers have used design automation algorithms inspired 
by evolution to design soft robots63. Soft robot designs have been automatically generated using 
custom finite element analysis software (VoxCAD), which accommodates materials with a large 
range of moduli, coupled with design optimization using an evolutionary algorithm64. In addition, 
evolutionary algorithms have been used to automatically generate soft robot designs65. 
Fabrication 
Recent progress in the field of soft robotics has been enabled by the development of rapid digital 
design and fabrication tools. Researchers have manufactured complex soft robotic systems by 
taking advantage of rapid and adaptable fabrication techniques66, including multimaterial 3D 
printing67, shape deposition manufacturing (SDM)68, and soft lithography69. These techniques 
can be combined to create composites with heterogenous materials (e.g. rubber with different

----- Page 7 (native) -----
stiffness moduli), embedded electronics, and internal channels for actuation31, 70. Direct digital 
printing with soft materials may be another option for fabricating arbitrary soft structures. A wide 
range of robot bodies can be fabricated using these techniques. The next section discussed control 
systems supporting a wide range of soft robot applications.  
Computation and Control 
Unlike the control of rigid bodies, whose movements can be described by six degrees of freedom 
(three rotations and three translations about the x, y, and z axes), the movements of soft bodies 
cannot be confined to planar motions. Soft materials are elastic and can bend, twist, stretch, 
compress, buckle, wrinkle, etc. Such motion can be viewed as offering an infinite number of 
degrees of freedom, a fact which makes the control of soft robots very challenging. Controlling 
soft robots requires new approaches to modeling, control, dynamics, and high-level planning.  
The muscle analogy for soft actuators has driven a number of biologically-inspired approaches 
to modeling and control for soft materials. The octopus’ arm is the prototypical example of a 
highly adaptive, soft actuator in nature that has been the source of inspiration for several 
biomimetic designs. The study of the octopus shows that it forms pseudo-joints and uses human-
like strategies for precise point-to-point movements such as fetching71. An understanding of the 
working principles and control of soft organisms (such as the octopus) has led to a model for the 
control of soft robots72. Likewise, the caterpillar has provided an ideal model for mobile soft 
robots73. The study of these systems for the development and implementation of soft robotic 
systems, has also, in turn, reflected back on our understanding of the mechanics and control of 
the associated natural systems74.  
Modeling and Kinematics 
The kinematics and dynamics of soft robotic systems are unlike those of traditional, rigid-bodied 
robots. When composed of a series of actuation elements, these robots approach a continuum 
behavior. In theory, the final shape of the robot can be described by a continuous function and 
modeling this behavior requires continuous mathematics. Because soft robots are different than 
traditional rigid linkage-based systems, researchers have developed new static, dynamic and 
kinematic models that capture their ability to bend and flex75. 
Robots made entirely from soft elastomer and powered by fluids do not yet have well 
understood models or planning and control algorithms primarily because their intrinsic 
deformation is continuous, complex, and highly compliant. Additionally, soft robots are often 
underactuated; they can contain many passive degrees of freedom, and when driven with low 
pressure fluids the available input fluid power is unable to compensate for gravitational loading. 
Soft robot designers often model the kinematics of soft robots using a simplifying assumption 
which leads to the piecewise constant curvature (PCC) model. Webster and Jones showed that the 
PCC model is equivalent to many other modeling approaches75. Building on the PCC model, 
researchers have developed methods to map the actuation space to configuration space. These 
approaches are robot-specific in that they integrate the morphology of the robot and the 
characteristics of the actuation system. One approach uses Bernoulli-Euler beam mechanics to 
predict deformation76, 75, 3; Another develops a relationship between the joint variables and the 
curvature arc parameters77 which applies to high and medium pressure robots; A third presents 
models that describe the deformation of robots actuated with low pressures28, 11, 29. These models 
are the basis for the forward kinematics of their respective systems. However, the PCC model

----- Page 8 (native) -----
does not capture all aspects of soft robots and in an effort to increase the envelope of the model, 
Renda et al developed non-constant curvature models78. 
The inverse kinematics (IK) problem, as posed in75 (i.e. computing the curvatures required to 
place a specified point on the robot body at a desired location), is more challenging. Existing 
literature has provided several approaches for semi-soft robots79, 77. A limitation of existing 
approaches to solving the IK problem for linear soft bodies (e.g. arms) is that currently neither 
the whole body, nor the pose of the end effector (which may be important for manipulation, 
sensing, etc.), are not considered in the solution. Autonomous obstacle avoidance and movement 
through a confined environment are difficult without a computational solution to the IK problem 
that is aware of the whole body of the robot in space. Real-time, closed-loop curvature controllers 
are required that drive the bending of the soft pneumatic body segments of the manipulator 
despite their high compliance and lack of kinematic constraints. Marchese et al. developed a 
method for closed-loop curvature control of a soft bodied planar manipulator30. This work used 
the PCC assumption with a cascaded curvature controller. Wang et al. proposed an alternative 
visual servo control approach for cable-driven soft robotic manipulators80. 
The inverse kinematics algorithm enables task-space planning algorithms to autonomously 1) 
position their end-effector (or some other part of their body) in free-space, 2) maneuver in 
confined environments, and 3) grasp-and-place objects. These task-space algorithms require that 
the planner considers the entire robot body (e.g. the whole arm not just the end effector for 
manipulators). Existing algorithms for whole body control81 assume rigid body systems and have 
not been extended to soft bodied robots. For whole body control of soft robots, it is difficult to 
control the configuration of the whole soft body due to compliance. Marchese et al.30 presented a 
computational approach to whole body planning for soft planar manipulators. This approach 
considered both the primary task of advancing the pose of the end effector of the soft robot, and 
the secondary task of positioning the changing envelope of the whole robot in relation to the 
environment30, 7.  
Control 
Researchers have used these models to develop new approaches to low-level control, inverse 
kinematics, dynamic operations, and planning for soft robotic systems. An important aspect of 
these algorithms is the use of compliance when the robot interacts with its environment. 
Compliance allows the robot to adapt its shape and function to objects of unknown or uncertain 
geometry and is the basis for new control and planning algorithms for soft robots in the presence 
of uncertainly. For example, soft robots can execute pick and place operations without precise 
positioning or accurate geometric models of the object to be grasped44.  
Low-level control for soft robots is done as pressure control using pressure transducers or 
volume control using strain sensors. Pressure control accommodates differences in actuator 
compliance. Volume control is an avenue to configuration control and supports setting a 
maximum safe displacement limit. Most fluid-powered soft robots use open-loop valve 
sequencing to control body segment actuation. Valve sequencing means that a valve is turned on 
for some duration of time to pressurize the actuator and then turned off to either hold or deflate it. 
Many soft robotic systems use this control approach21, 28, 29, 34, 10. Marchese et al. demonstrated 
continuously adjustable, variable pressurization using a fluidic drive cylinder30. Recent work has 
sought to develop control elements for pneumatic soft robots (e.g. valves), which do not require 
electrical control signals. In this work, passive valves with memory allow the addressable control 
of many soft robotic actuators from a single controlled pressure source82.

----- Page 9 (native) -----
The dynamics of soft robots open the door for new robot capabilities. Much like a child on a 
swing set, repeatable positioning of a soft tentacle places it outside of its gravity compensation 
envelope, where the end effector could accomplish tasks. Physical phenomena common to soft 
robots—including actuation limits, the self-loading effects of gravity, and the high compliance of 
the manipulator—can be represented as constraints within a trajectory optimization algorithm 
that operates on a dynamic model of the soft robot7. One example dynamic maneuver enables soft 
robots to interact with humans by quickly grabbing objects directly from the hand of a human7. 
Dynamic control of soft robots can be achieved using a new dynamic model for a spatial soft 
fluidic elastomer manipulator, a method for identifying all unknown system parameters (i.e. the 
soft manipulator, fluidic actuators, and continuous drive cylinders or valving), and a planning 
algorithm that computes locally-optimal dynamic maneuvers through iterative learning control. 
The this approach represents actuation limits, the self-loading effects of gravity, and the high 
compliance of the manipulator, as constraints within the optimization.  
Dynamic models of hard and semi-soft continuum robots provide examples for a variety of 
control techniques for soft robots83, 76, 84. Other work has modeled dynamic polymeric pneumatic 
tubes subject to tip loading using a bending beam approximation85, but this has not been used for 
control. Tatlicioglu et al. developed a dynamic model for, and provided simulations of, a planar 
extensible continuum manipulator using a Lagrangian approach86. Luo et al.87 modeled the 
dynamics of a soft planar snake. 
Systems and Applications 
In this section we review some of the systems and that have been developed to date to address a 
variety of potential applications to locomotion, manipulation, and human-machine interaction. 
Locomotion 
Recent work has explored the modes of locomotion possible with (or enabled by) soft bodies 
(Fig. 1). Notably, studies of caterpillars have led to a soft robotic systems20, 73, as well as a further 
understanding of the control of motion in these animals74. An understanding of worm 
biomechanics also led to a bioinspired worm design composed of flexible materials and actuated 
by shape memory actuators (SMAs)88, and an annelid inspired robot actuated by dielectric 
elastomer22. A European initiative studied the biomechanics and control of the octopus to 
produce a soft robotic prototype24, 9. Likewise, a self-contained, autonomous robotic fish actuated 
by soft fluidic actuators was demonstrated to be capable of forward swimming, turning, and 
depth adjustment11, 31 (see Fig. 5). This robot can execute a c-turn escape maneuver in 100 
milliseconds, which is on par with its biological counterpart, enabling the use of this robot as an 
instrument (i.e. a physical model) for biological studies. Soft robotics projects have also explored 
quadrupedal locomotion29, 10, rolling28, 73, and snake-like undulation8. Jumping has also been 
achieved using internal combustion of hydrocarbon fuels to achieve rapid energy release57, 58. 
Many of the exciting applications for soft robotics (e.g. search-and-rescue, environmental 
monitoring), require an autonomous, mobile system. However, most experimental soft robotic 
systems rely on power and/or control signals delivered through pneumatic and/or electrical 
tethers. Since typical actuation power sources (e.g. air compressors, batteries) are relatively 
heavy (e.g. 1.2 kg10), tethers greatly simplify system design by significantly reducing the required 
carrying capacity. One approach to achieving mobile systems is to tether a soft robot to a mobile 
rigid robot with a greater carrying capacity89. Untethered mobile systems have circumvented the

----- Page 10 (native) -----
challenge of carrying heavy power sources by operating underwater11, 31 or rolling on a 
surface28, 8 such that actuation system masses do not have to be lifted against gravity. Another 
approach has developed materials and designs tailored to operate at working pressures high 
enough to carry large payloads10.  
Manipulation 
Manipulation is one of the canonical challenges for robotics (Fig. 3). Soft systems have a natural 
advantage over rigid robots in grasping an manipulating unknown objects since the compliance 
of soft grippers allows them to adapt to a variety of objects with simple control schemes. 
Grippers which employ isothermal phase change due to granular jamming have taken advantage 
of this feature of soft systems44, 90. Underactuated grippers composed of silicone elastomers with 
embedded 
pneumatic 
channels 
have 
also 
demonstrated 
impressive 
adaptability33,13. 
Commercially developed systems have also demonstrated manipulation with lightweight grippers 
composed of inflated flexible (but not extensible) material91. As one of the more mature 
applications of soft robotic technology, companies have begun to produce soft robotic 
manipulators (e.g. Pneubotics an Otherlab Company, Empire Robotics Inc., Soft Robotics Inc.). 
Medical/Wearable Applications 
One of the natural advantages of soft robotic systems is the compatibility of their moduli with 
those of natural tissues for medical and wearable applications. Rigid medical devices or orthoses 
run the risk of causing damage or discomfort to human or animal tissue. Additionally, it can be 
difficult to perfectly replicate the motion of natural joints with rigid orthodics. One possibility is 
to integrate a degree of compliance into wearable devices, for example for orthopedic 
rehabilitation. Recently, researchers have begun to look at medical wearable applications for soft 
robotics including soft wearable input devices (e.g. wearable keyboards92), soft orthodics for 
human ankle-foot rehabilitation37, soft sensing suits for lower limb measurement93, soft actuated 
systems for gait rehabilitation of rodents who have had their spinal cord surgically cut94, and a 
soft system for simulation of cardiac actuation95. 
Soft Cyborgs 
Recent work has begun to investigate robotic systems that directly integrate biological (as 
opposed to artificial, biologically compatible) materials. Since biological materials are often very 
soft, the resulting systems are soft robotic systems (or perhaps they would be more aptly named 
soft cyborgs). For example, microbes which digest organic material and produce electricity have 
powered artificial muscles for autonomous robots96, and cardiomyocytes have been used to 
power a jellyfish inspired swimming cyborg97. One challenge with using swarms of inexpensive 
soft robots for exploration is that of retrieving the robots once the task is completed. One way to 
avoid this problem is to develop biodegradable and the soft robots powered by gelatin actuators98. 
Since gelatin is edible, there may also be medical applications for this technology. 
Future Directions 
The field of soft robotics aims to create the science and applications of soft autonomy by asking 
the questions: How do we design and control soft machines, and how do we use these new 
machines?  Current research on the algorithmic and device-level aspects of soft robots has 
demonstrated soft devices that can locomote, manipulate, and interact with people and their

----- Page 11 (native) -----
environment in unique ways. Soft mobile robots capable of locomotion on unknown terrain and 
soft robot manipulators capable of pose-invariant and shape-invariant grasping rely on 
compliance to mitigate uncertainty and adapt to environment and task. These basic behaviors 
open the door for applications where robots work closely with humans. For example, a soft robot 
manipulator could handle and prep a wide variety of food items in the kitchen while a soft mobile 
robot could use contact to guide patients during physiotherapy exercises. The soft home robot 
could assist the elderly with monitoring their medicine regiments while a soft factory robot could 
support humans in delicate assembly tasks. But how do we get to the point where soft robots 
deliver on their full potential?  We need (1) rapid design tools and fabrication recipes for low-
cost soft robots, (2) novel algorithmic approaches to the control of soft robots that account for 
their material properties, (3) tools for developing device-specific programming environments that 
allow non-experts to use the soft machines, (4) creative individuals to design new solutions, and 
(5) early adopters of the technology.  
The soft robotics community is creating materials that have the ability to compute, sense, and 
move, leading to a convergence between materials and machines. The materials are becoming 
more like computers due to embedded electro-mechanical components, and machines are getting 
softer due to the alternative materials used to create them. This convergence requires tools for 
functional specification and automated co-design of the soft body (including all the components 
necessary for actuation, sensing, and computation) and the soft brain (including all software 
aspects of controlling the device and reasoning about the world and the goal task). Progress in 
new materials with programmable stiffness properties, proprioceptive sensing, contact modeling, 
and recipes for rapid fabrication will enable the creation of increasingly more capable soft 
machines.  
But how soft should a soft robot be in order to meet its true potential?  As with many aspects 
of robotics, this depends on the task and environment. For domains that require extreme body 
compliance (e.g. inspecting a pipe with complex geometry or laproscopic surgery) or dealing 
with a great amount of uncertainty (e.g. locomotion on rocky uneven terrain or grasping unknown 
objects), soft machines can bring the capabilities of robots to new levels. However, soft robots 
are difficult to model and control, especially when they need to retain a desired body 
configuration without external support (e.g. an elephant trunk holding an object at a desired 
height in the presence of gravity). Augmenting soft machines with skeletons, much like 
vertebrates, could simplify such tasks. An important consideration for the future of soft machines 
is how to match the softness of the body to the range of capabilities expected from the machine in 
a way that most effectively leverages the body.  
Rapid fabrication recipes and tools for soft robots with embedded electronics are needed to 
expand the user base beyond experts. Additionally, more advances are needed to expand the 
computation and control capabilities of existing systems. The current approaches to robot control 
rely on external localization. But soft robots that operate autonomously need the ability to 
localize proprioceptively. Current models for soft robots do not capture their dynamics. Improved 
dynamics models will lead to more capable controllers. Although the current planners for soft 
robots allow the systems to collide harmlessly with their environments, the collision are not 
detected. However, contact with the environment can be a useful aspect of task-level planning.  
Soft robots have the potential to provide a link between living systems and artificial systems at 
multiple levels: high-level tasks, in interaction between humans and robots, and in cognition. 
Pfeifer and Bongard have argued that bodies are central to the way that we think99. This view, 
embodied artificial intelligence, holds that robotic bodies and brains must be considered and

developed in concert, much as the bodies and brains of their biological counterparts co-evolved. 
Soft robotic systems have the potential to exploit morphological computation to adapt to, and 
interact with, the world in a way that is difficult or impossible with rigid systems. Following the 
principles of embodied artificial intelligence, soft robots may allow us to develop biologically 
inspired artificial intelligence in ways that are not possible with rigid bodied robots.

elastomeric tube in a woven fiber shell. A pressure applied internally causes the tube and shell to 
expand radially, causing longitudinal contraction. d) Fluidic elastic actuator or Pneu-Net design 
consisting of a pneumatic network of channels in an elastomer that expand when filled with a 
pressurized fluid, causing the soft body to bend toward a strain limited layer (e.g. a stiffer rubber 
or elastomer embedded with paper or other tensile fibers).
