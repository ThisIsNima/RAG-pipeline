We dpfinp
incrPFiPntal
and
radical
changp within
this
framework
and charactprizp
an
important class
of
innovations
as
"generat ional ."
We
argue
that generational
innovation
is qualitativply diffprpnt
from
radical
and
incremental
innovation.
While
incremental
innovation changes
the performancp
of
an
existing set
of components,
and
radical
innovation changes
the elpments
of
that
set,
generational
innovation changes
the
relationships between
them.
While
radical
innovation challenges
the established organization with
a wholly different
system,
the challengp
of gpnprational
innovation
is
to
learn about
a differently
configured version
of
an pstablished system.
Knowledge gained
through experience
with
incremental
innovation about
particular component
tpchnologies
often
rpmains
relevant,
but
"relational
knowledge,"
or knowledge

interactions betwppn

TT
Conceptual
Frapipwork
Thp cpntral
notion
in
the existing
litpraturp on
tpchnical
innovation
is
the
distinction between
refining and
improving
an existing design,
and
introducing
a
new concept
that
departs
in
a significant
way
from past
practice.

Nelson

which
firms search "locally"

("Nelson

the

radical

is
far
n^ore dynamic
and
imcprtain
than
that
associated with
incrpinental
innovation
(^Dpss
and
Beard,
T^iRA).
Innovation's
impact
on compptition depends on
its
effpcts
on bnth
the snpplv
and demand
sides
of
the market.
On
the supply
side,
thp
two pattprns
of
innovation
are associated with very different
organizational
capabilities.
Radical
and
incremental
innovation
require
not
only
a difference
in knowledge base,
but
also
in organizational
structure
and process.
Tn general
it
appears
that
more
formal,
"hierarchical" organizations
that
rely
on structured patterns
of communication,
problem solving
routines
and procedures
are best
equipped
to undertake
incrempntal
innovation,
while more "organic," "entrepreneurial" organizations
in which
the
information
flow
is
relatively unstructured
and which are more
responsive
to
dramatic change
are best equipped
to exploit
radical
innovation
(Burns
and
Stalker,
1966; Moch and Morse,
1977;
Hage
,
1980;
Kimberly
and
F.vanisko,
1981;
Ettlie,
1983;
Ettlie.
Bridges
and O'Keefe,
1984;
Dewar
and
Button,
1986^
It
is
this connection betwppn
innovation
and organizational
capability
that
gives
radical
innovation
its
ability
to transform
thp compptitivp environment.
Organizational
capabilities
are difficult
to
create,
and costly
to adjust
(Nelson
and Winter,
1982;
Hannan
and
Freeman,
198A>.
An established
firm
faced with
radical
innovation must
make very diffprent
decisions
and must
makp
them vety
differently.
The number
and magnitude

the changes
that
radical
innovation
requires

the

Differpnces
in organizational
capability help
to explain changps
in
the
"suppliers"
of
innovation.
But
competition
is also shaped
by
an
innovation's
effects
on demand.
The cnmulative
economic
effects
of
incremental
innovation
arp
often significant,
and
incremental
innovation often broadens
a
product's
appeal
and expands
its market.
Radical
innovation,
in contrast,
offers customprs
a wholly
new set
of
possibilities,
or meets established
needs
in
a wholly different
way.
Although
the new concept
may bear
some
relationship
to
the pstablished design,
thp
change
in price/performance
is usually
so
dramiatlc,
and
the new needs
it
meets
are
so different,
that
the
old
product
becomes
at
best
a very poor
sut)stitntp
for
thp
new design.
Indeed,
in
the economics
literature,
radical
innovation
is defined
as
Innovation
that
creates such changes
in performance
or cost
that
the
old
product
cannot
act
as
a
substitute
for
the new even
at
competitive prices
(^Gilbprt
and
Newbery,
1982;
Relnganaum,
1983>.
As
this brief summary suggests,
research
on
Innovation,
organization
and
competition over
the
last
several
years has
added
important
insights
into
incremental
and
radical
innovation
and
the organizational
characteristics
and
competitive consequences associated with
them.
However
there has been strikingly
little discussion about
intermediate classes
of
innovation.
We believe
that
this
neglect
flows
from
a
reluctance
to break open
the
"black
box"
that
is
a specific
technology
in order
to understand
its competitive
and
organizational
implications.
Although some students
of
technology
and
economic
history
(See
for example,
work
by Rosenberg,
n97Ajq82t;
Abernathy,
n^TRI;
Abernathy and

technologies
and
examined
their
inner structure
to some
extent,
few studies
have
developed
an understandine
of how
thp characteristics
of
the
tt^chnoloey
affect
the
innovation process.
There
is
an intuitive sense
in
the
literature,
and
some
empiiical
evidence,
that
innovations
in very different
technologies may be
different
in character because
of
the underlying structure
of
the
technology
TMoch
and Morse,
1977;
Kttlie,
Bridges
and O'Keefe,
1984;
Sahal
,
198A;
riark,
1987^
But
we have
few ways
to
talk
about
these differences beyond
economic concepts
like
minimum efficient
scale,
returns
to scale
and
appropr

i t y
.
Developing
a
framework
that
allows
one
to define
and
analy?e
intermediate
classes
of
innovation may help
us
to understand
an
important
das*;
of
technological
changes,
and may also deepen our understanding
of
innovation,
organization
and compptition
in general.
The Framework
The
framework we
present
in
this section
is summarized
in Figure
f" H
.
In order
to
focus
the discussion,
we develop
it
in
terms
of
product
technology,
but
the concepts
are genpral;
they apply
to processes
as well.
Our starting
point
is
the distinction between
the
product
as
a whole
-
the "system"
- and
the
product
in
its parts
-
the "components."
(This
is
an old
and well
established distinction.
See
for example,
work
by Marples
n9Al)
and Alexander
(19fi4K^
We conceive
of
the
product
as
a
set
of components,
(\K
Take,
for example,
a
roopi
fan.
Tts major
components
include
the
blade,
the motor
that drives
it,
the blade
guard,
a
simple
control system and
a mechanical
housing.
For
the moment
we will
use
the
intuitive
1
Saviotti
and Metcalfe
(1984)
have proposed
a framework
that
is
related
to
the
one we propose here.
They distinguish between three sets
of product
characteristics:
those
that
describe
its
technical
features,
those
that
describe
the services
that
it
performs
and
those
that describe
the method
of
its
production.

notion
that
each
rnniponpnt
fills
a distinct
function
and
is physically distinct
from
thp
othp>
rnmponpnts.
F.ach componpnt
is charactpri/pd
by
a
spt
of
"compnnpnt
parai-ppters"
Cv>,
which
describe some
physical
attribute
of
thp componpnt,
For
the
fan bladp,
for pxamplp,
the component parameters
include
the wpight
of
thp
bladp
and
its
dinpn'^ions
.
A
complpte
set
of
component
parameters would
constitute
an exhaustive description
of
each component
.
At
the system
level,
the
product
is characterized
by
a
set
of parameters
(Y)
that describe
the physical
properties
of
the system as
a whole.
Tn our
fan example
the system properties
include
things
like
total
weight,
the voUimp
of
air moved
per minute,
and
resistance
to
impact.
Any
individual
system property
like
the
volume
of
air moved
per minute
is determined
by
the
interaction betwppn
spvpral
component parameters.
For example,
the
amount
of air
a
fan puts
out
is
a
function
of
the size
and shape
of
the
bladp,
the powpr of
the motor,
and
the pfficiency
with which
the motor drives
the blade.
We
represent
this
in
the model
by
showing
each system parameter
as
a function of
some
subset
of
the component
parameters.
Thus
,
we have
:

The function fO
is
a
statement
of
the
physical
laws governing
the
relationships between
the componpnt

Sometimes
it can
be approximated
by mathematical
formulae dprived
from
an understanding
of
the physics

A single component
parameter can affect
spvpral
system parameters.
For
example,
the dimensions
of
a
fan blade affect
not
only
the
amouiit
of
air
that
it
puts
out
but
also
its esthetic
appeal
and
its portability.
This
restricts
the
available
set
of system parameters.
Tt
is very difficult,
for examplp,
to dpsign
a
fan
that weighs
as
little
as
an alarm clock

In

depends
on its

the mean

We

Thus,

Types
of Technological
Change
This
framework allows
us
to characterize "incremental"
and
"radical"
innovation and provides
us with
a
useful
framework
for analyzing intermediate
classes
of
innovation.
In
the context
of
the
model,
the emergence
of
a
"dominant
design"
fAbernathy,
1978;
Sahal
,
1986^
is equivalent
to
the emergence
of
a
stable
set
of components,
system parameters
and customer
needs.
"Tncrerrpnt al"
innovation
improves
individual
component
performance,
changing
the values
of
one
or more
component
parameters,
and
thus changing
the values
r>f
some
of
the system
parameters and user
needs.
But
it
leaves
the elements
of
the
sets X,Y
and
Z
and
thp

and
g^'^Y*"',

"Radical"
innovation occurs when
a new design changes
the
set
of components,
system parameters and user needs,
or the elements
of
the
sets
X,
Y,
and
Z,
thereby
also changing
the relationships between them,
or the form of
the functions
h„(X*)
and
g„(Y*).
In
its extreme
form,
radical innovation introduces
a completely
different
set
of components and
a wholly new system.
But
in general,
"more
radical"
innovations
introduce more new components and consequently affect more
system
parameters and more user needs.
We define
a generational innovation as innovation that changes
the
relationships between the components,
system parameters and user needs
of
the
technology but that leaves
the
set
of components,
system parameters and user needs
themselves
relatively unchanged.
VThile incremental innovation changes
the value of
the
sets
X,
Y,
and
Z,
and radical innovation changes
the elements
of
the
sets
X,
Y,
and
Z and the relationships
that
link them
[h„(X*)
,
g„(Y*],
generational innovation
changes the values and relationships,
but leaves the elements
largely unchanged.
Generational innovation
is
sometimes triggered by changes
in
a particular component
technology,
but its essence
is
a fundamental reconfiguring of
the technological
system around an essentially stable
set
of components,
system parameters,
and
customer needs.
The room air fan example can illustrate
the distinctions
that
the model allows
us
to draw.
Suppose,
for example,
that the established product concept
is
a
large,
electric powered fan, moimted in the ceiling, with the motor hidden from view and
insulated to dampen the noise.
The control
system is an on-off
switch mounted on
the wall and connected
to
the
fan through a
set
of wires
that
run inside
the wall
and ceiling.
An incremental innovation could involve an improvement
in blade design and
in
the power
of
the motor
to achieve
a higher rate
of cooling.
The introduction of
a
central air conditioner would be
a radical
innovation.
Not all
of the established
knowledge base would become obsolete.
The new technology would involve using fans
to move air and would require knowledge
of electric motors and fan design.

Furthermore,
the product
would
be
used
in
a very different
way
and
might
be
sold
to wholly different
rustomer'^.
The distinction between
radical
and
i ncrpiriental
innovation
is
therefore
clear.
What
of
g'^nprat ional
innovation"!"
For
the
maker
of
large ceiling mounted
room
fans,
the
introduction
of
a portable
fan would
be
a
generational
innovation.
While
the basic components would
be
largely
the
same
(f.g.
blade,
motor,
control
system!*,
the design choices would
be different
("e.g.
different
materials)
and
thf
values
of
the component
parameters would
change
(e.g.
smaller dimensions).
Tn
this
sense,
the change
from ceiling
to
portable
fan has
the character
of
an
in^rpmental
innovation.
Rut
there would
also
be significant
changes
in
the interactions
between components
and
in
the menu
of user needs
the product
could meet.
The
smaller size and
the co-location
of
the motor and
the blade
in
the
room would
focus attention
on new types
of
interaction between
the motor size,
the blade
dimensions
and
the amount
of
air
that
the
fan could generate.
Shrinking
the
size
of
the apparatus would probably
require
new materials with
new properties,
as well
as new interactions between performance
and weight.
On
the user side,
there could
be
new tradeoffs between ease
of
use,
safety and
reliability.
It
is
the need
to
explore
these new patterns
of
interaction
and
these new sets
of
tradeoffs
that
sets
apart
this kind
of
innovation.
Radical
innovation obsoletes much
of
the
existing knowledge
,-=ind
the knowledge
processing capabilities
of established
firms,
but
this obsolescence
is usually
immediately evident.
The obsolescence
of established
firm knowledge
triggered by
generational
innovation
is much harder
to observe
and may
he more difficult
to
correct.
We
can
best
illustrate
these differences,
and
-explore
their competitive
significance,
through
a discussion
of
the knowledge
required
to undertake
successful
product
design.

The

for
a

clearly depend upon
the way
in
which knowledge

we have
abstracted

this
issue
in order
to
focus clearly upon
the differpncps
in
thp
infoi-mation

tasks presented
to
the organization by different
types
of

Consider

and
they must
understand how these

Finally,
in order
to design
a
new product
successfully
a
designer must
be
able
to
roughly assess
the
relative
economic value

We deliberately avoid
a discussion
of "invention,"

of

source
of
the new idea.
While
the problem of where
inventions
are
likely
to come
from
is
important
and
interesting,
we believe
that
a study
of
the
implementation of
that
new
idea,
or
its translation
into
a saleable product
is
at
least
as important,
and
provides more
insight
into
the
nature
of
the information processing

that
an

As
a
technology pvoIvps
both
the designer's stock
of knowledge
and
the
routines
or procedures
that
they use
for acquiring new knowledge change.
The
process
of design always
requires
the development
of new knowledge,
but
the
types
of
new knowledge
that
are
required differ dramatically with
the
natiire
of
the
innovation.
During periods
of
radical
innovation
there
is widespread
experimentation
in product
design.
Products
are characterised
by widely different
sets
of components,
system parameters
and user needs.
For any single
product,

of
thp

to have very
little knowlpdge
of

since
every new product
embodies
a widely different

Knowledge
about
the valup?
that
customprs place
on diffprpnt
configurations
of user needs,
and
of
the most
cost
effective way
of
meeting
them will
also
be
scarce.
The process
of
radical
innovation can be
thought
of
as
a process
of exploring
the market
and
the
technology "space"
in order
to
better understand
both
the customer nepds
and

The
transition
to
incremental
innovation changes
the
types
of knowledge
that
are most
useful
to
the designer.
While competitive advantage during periods
of
radical
innovation
is gained
by
the
introduction
of quite different
products
incorporating quite
different
component
technologies,
during periods
of
incremental
innovation
it
is gained
by
the morp pffpctive exploitation
of
a
limited set
of components
and user needs within
the context
of
a
stable
set
of
interactions.
It
becomes both possible
and valuable
to dpvelop
a more detailed
understanding
of
the
relationships between
the existing components,
system
parameters
and customer
needs.
As
the
technology matures
this knowledge
is
likely
to become widely diffused
or relatively "cheap"
and
the desigupr's
time
is
likely
to acquire detailed knowledge
about
the performance
of particular componpnts
and
about
a
limited
set
of component/parametpr/customer nppd
interactions.
Tn
teois
of
our
framework,
the designer devplops vpry detailed knowledge
about
particular
members
of
the
sets

,
(Y)
and
( Z)
and,
since
these elements
remain
stable,
detailed knowledge
about
some known subset
of
relationships
h,,,(x*'>
and gJY"^.
Moreover
they will
develop strategies
for acquiring new knowledge
that
are
tightly
focused
on
these particular
cornponent
technologies
and
on
a
limited
set
of
particularly critical
interactions.
Given
this context,
we can begin
to understand
the
implications
of
"generational"
innovation
for
the knowledge
and knowledge processing capabilities

This obsolescence
of
the
"relational
knowledge"
of
the designer may be
just
as significant
as
the
obsolescence
that
is associated with
radical
innovation.
In
sonp situations
it
may
be
even more significant
because
it
is more difficult
to
identify.
The advent
of
radical
innovation
-
of completely different
component
technologies or quite different
types
of
user needs
-
is usually unmistakable,
and
a designer
runs
little
risk
of assuming
that
their historical
knowlpdge
is
relevant.
But generational
innovation
is more
subtle,
and
it
may
be much more
difficult
to
notice
that
ones
relational
knowledge has become obsolete.
The
spt
of
components,
system parameters and user needs
remains
stable,
and much
of
the
designer's knowledge
remains
relevant.
There
are
fewer signals
to
alert
the
designer
to
the nature
of
the
innovation,
and
a designer
miay attempt
to meet
the
threat
of
a competitive
product
with
a design
that
is based upon his
or her
historically derived
relational
knowledge
and
the
routines
that
they have
developed
to gather new knowledge
that
were appropriate
to
the previous generation
of
the
technology.
As
a
result
they
run
the
risk
of producing
a significantly
inferior product
and "failing"
in
the
face
of generational
innovation.
A characterization
of
the information processing
task
that
is
perfoiTned
within
an organization designing
a new product
is
a much more complex problem.
But
to
the
extent
that
the dynamics
that
we have described
in
the case
of
a
single
boundedly
rational
individual
also characterize
the dynamics
of
the evolution
of
the knowledge
and knowledge processing capabilities
of
an organization,
this
framework gives
us
insight
into
the
reasons
that
generational
innovation may have
such dramatic organizational
and competitive
implications.

here only
as an Illustration
of

of our framework.
The
rigorous
formulation and
testing
of
appropriate hypotheses
remains
to
be
done.
Photolithographic aligners
are
used
to manufacture
solid
state semiconductor
devices.
The production
of semiconductors
requires
the
transfer
of
small
intricate
patterns
to
the surface of
a "wafer"
of semiconductor material
such
as
silicon,
and
this process
of transfer
Is known
as "lithography." Figure
^21
schematically
Illustrates
the
lithography process.
The surface of
the wafer
Is coated with
a
light
sensitive chemical
or "resist."
The pattern
that
is
to
be
transferrpd
to
the
wafer surface
is drawn onto
a "mask"
and
the mask
is used
to block
light
as

Oiir anaiysis draws
on
the
results
of
a much
larger study
of
the
technical
and
competitive history of
the industry
(Henderson,
1988).
This study Included
the
construction
of comprehensive
technical,
managerial
and sales histories
for every
product development project undertaken
in
the industry's history since
19f.5.
These
histories drew from field
interviews with over one hundred
individuals,
including
product
designers
and
leading engineers and scientists,
and
from intensive study
of
Internal
firm documents,
the
trade press and
the major scientific
journals.
An
important
element
of
the work was
the use
of an iterative validation process
to
ensure
its accuracy.
At
each stage
of
the
research written summaries
of
the
results
and
the preliminary conclusions were circulated
to key individuals
and
confirmed
through
follow up
interviews.

A photolithographic

and
to expose

describes
the principal
components
of
a generic
optical
photolithographic
aligner.
The core technologies
of
photolithographic
alignment
have
remained
stable
since
the technology was
first developed
in
the middle sixties.
Despite
this
stability,
the competitive history
of
the
industry has been strikingly
turbulent.
A sequence
of dominant
firms have
each
in turn
failed
to maintain
their position
in
the
industry.
Table M)
shows
the sales histories
of
the
leading
firms.
The
first commercially successful
aligner was introduced
by Kulicke
and
Soffa
in
llfiS.
They were extremely successful
and held nearly
100%
of
the
(very smalH
market
for
the
next
nine
years,
but
by
1974 Cobilt
and Rasper had
replaced
them and held
approximately half
of
the market
for contact
aligners
each.
In
197A
pprkin Elmer
entered
the market,
and immediate became
the
largest
firm
in
the
industry.
Further
entry followed
in
the
late
1970s,
and
by
1981
GCA and Canon were
the
leading
players.
As
of
this writing GCA has
also
lost
its dominant position
and while
Canon
remains
an important
player Nikon
is probably
the
largest
firm
in
leading
edge photolithographic
equipment
today.

Resist may be either "negative"
or "positive."
Tf
a negative
resist
is used
the unexposed areas
are stripped
away during processing.
If
a positive
resist
is
used
the
exposed
areas
are stripped
away.

of
semiconductor lithography

All

things
equal,
the smaller
the
si7e
of
a
semicnndnrtnr
device,
the
faster
it
<~an
rnn
and
the cheaper
it
is
to mannf acture
,
and
since
historically device
size has
heen
limited
hy
the
miniirnim feature
si;7e capahility
of
the
lithographic
process,
users have demanded aligners with smaller
and smaller
mininnim feature
size capahility.
Users
are also concerned
ahont
the
eqnipTnent's
throughput,
yield,
footprint,
tTiaximurp wafer size capahility,
reliability
and
f lexibi lity.5
An aligner
is
an extremely complex piece
of
eqnipnipnt,
and
can
be
characterized
by many system
parairieters
.
The
m'ost
critical
are
those
that
support
its central
function
-
its ability
to accurately and consistently
replicate
an
extremely small
pattern
on
the wafer,
or
to support
particular
minirrium feature
size capability.
Three system parameters
are particularly critical
in
this
respect:
"resolution,"
"critical
line width control"
and
"overlay."
Figure
CS)
defines
these
three parameters
and
illustrates
their
relationship
to each other.
An aligner's minimum feature size capability cannot
exceed
its
resolution since
its
resolution
is
the size
of
the
smallest
optical
image
that
it
can
transmit
to
the wafer.
But
superb resolution
is useless
if
the
image cannot
be accurately
positioned
or
reliably
reproduced.
If
the aligner
is
not
accurate
-
that
is
if
its
overlay characteristics are
not
very
good
- or
if
the process
of
image
transfer
is
not
reliable
-
that
is
if
the aligner's critical
dimension control
is
not
adequate
-
then
the
aligner's minimum feature size capability will
be
less
than
its minimum
resolution.
5
The
Tiiaximum size
of
the silicon wafers used
in production has grown
from
less
than one inch
in diameter
in
the sixties
to
the
eight
inch wafer;' used
today,
and
users need
lithographic equipment
that
can handle
the
size
that
they have
chosen,
The
throughput,
yield
and
footprint
of
an aligner
all
drive
its effective
cost.
The faster
the throughput
and
the higher
the
yield,
or
the more
"good" wafers
produced per hour,
the cheaper
the aligner
is
to operate.
"Footprint"
is
a measure
of
the area
that
the aligner
requires
on
the semiconductor production
floor.
Since
semiconductor facilities
are extremely expensive,
customers
prefer aligners
to be
as small
as possible.

The basic concepts
of
alignment
technology have
remained stablp sincp
it
was
first
developed,
but
the industry has seen
all
of
the
three
types
of
innovation
that
wp have
identified:
radical,
incremental
and generational,
Commprcial
production has been dominated
by optical
photolithography,
in which
light
is used
as
the exposure source,
but
radical
alternativps
that
make
use
of alternativp
sources
and quite different
mask,
alignmpnt
and
image
transfer technologies have
been explored
since
the
early
seventies.** Thpy offpr customers bptter minimum
feature
size
capability,
but
to date both
their cost
and
a
number
of unsolved
technical
problems have prevpntpd
them
from being widely used
beyond
research
and
development.
We therpfore
focus here
on
the optical
systems
that
have dominated
the
industry,
Tncrpmental
innovation has bppn critical
to optical
photolithography's
continuing
succpss.

improved:
for example modern sources
are significantly more
powerful
-inrl more
uniform,
alignment
systems
are much more accurate
and
lenses
arp
larger
and suffer
less
from distortion.
The
industry has also seen significant
generational
innovation.
The key
relationships between components
and system parameters,
and between system
parameters
and customer nepds have shifted dramatically
four
times over
the course
of
the
industry's history
as
the
industry has
shifted
from
the simple contact
and
proximity aligners
to
the more sophisticated optical
systems
that
"scan"
the mask
relative
to
the wafer
or
that
"step"
it
slowly across
the wafer surface.
One
indication
of
the presence
of generational
innovation
is visible
in
figures
C?)
and
(7'>,
which show
the historical
perfonnance
of
each generation
in terms
of
its
throughput,
yield
and minimum
feature
size.
Each arrow
reflects
a particular
technological
trajectory,
and
summari;^es
a history of
incremental
improvement
within each generation.
The movement
between arrows
- from one technological
trajectory
to another
- reflects generational
innovation
in
the underlying
technology.
We
can develop more
insight
into
the nature
of generational
innovation
in
the
industry by comparing
the
relationships between components
and
system parameters
that
underlie
the user need
for minimum feature
size
in
the contact
and proximity
aligner.
Contact
and
proximity aligners are
relatively simple
so
that
their
technology can be easily described,
and
a
focus
on minimum
feature
size,
the most
critical dimension
of
the aligner's perfonnance,
allows
us
to grasp
the essence
of
generational
innovation without
the need
to present
an exhaustive analysis
of
the
determinants
of
every system parameter.
Contact
aligners were
the
first
photolithographic aligners
to
be used
commercially.
They use
the mask's "shadow"
to transfer
the mask pattern
to
the
wafer surface.
The mask
and
the wafer are held
"in contact" with each other,
and
light
shining
through
the gaps
in
the mask falls onto
the wafer surface.

sinnplp and quick
to
use
but
the
need
to bring
thp mask
and
the wafpr
into direct
contact
can damage
the mask
or contaminate
the wafer.
The
first
proximity aligner
was introduced
in
1973
to solve
these
problems.
Tn
a
proximity aligner
the mask
is
held
a small
distance away from
("in proximity
to")
the wafer surface.
The
separation of
the
rnask
and
the wafer means
that
they are
less
likely
to
be damaged
during exposure,
but
since
the mask
and wafer are separated
from each
other,
light
coiuing
through
the mask "spreads out" before
it
reaches
the
resist,
and
the mask's
shadow
is
less well
defined
that
it
is
in
the
case
of
a
contact
aligner.
^Figure
(9)
presents
a schematic diagram of
a proximity aligner.)
As
a
result
users
switching
to proximity aligners were
forced
to
trade
off minimum feature
size
capability
for
increased
yield.
The
introduction of
the proximity aligner
is clearly
not
a
radical
advance
over
the contact
aligner.
The conceptual
change involved
in going
from one
to
the
other was minor,
and most
proximity aligners
can also
be
used
as contact
aligners.
However,
as figures
(10)
and
(11)
reveal,
the
relationships between component
parameters,
system parameters
and minimum
feature
size
are quite different
for
the
two technologies.
The
introduction
of proximity alignment
introduced
generational
innovation
into
the
industry.
The minimum feature size capability
of
a
contact
aligner
is
limited by
its
overlay and critical
dimension characteristics.
As
long
as
contac^t
between
the
mask and
the wafer
is "perfect"
- absolutely
flat
and
parallel
across
the wafer
-
yield
loss
is minimal,
the
image
of
the mask
is
not
distorted
and
the aligner's
minimum feature size capability
is
limited only
by
its
resolution.
Since
the
contact
aligner does
not
rely upon either
an
optical
system or upon
a
gap
to
transmit
the
image
of
the
mask
to
the wafer,
resolution
is
limited
only
by
the
source wavelength,
and until
recently
the
resolution
of contact aligners has been
greater
than
that
of
any
of
the other generations
of
equipment.

These
are
a
function
of
the precision of

Tn contrast,
the minimum feature size capability
of
a proximity printer
is
limited
by
its

by
its critical
dimension control,
and
these
are
functions
of quite different
component
parameters.
Resolution
is
limited
not
by
the wavelength
of

but
by
the size
of
the
gap between
the mask and
the

As
a
result
although
the minimum feature
size capability of
a contact
aligner
is
rarely
limited
by
its
resolution,
resolution
is very much
a
binding
constraint
in
a proximity aligner.
The aligner's critical
dimension control
is
limited
by
the uniformity of
the
gap between
the mask
and
the wafer,
since
if
the
gap
is wider
in some places
than
in others
the
light
will
have
a chance
to "spread
out
further,"
producing
an image
of
a different
size
at
the wafer.
The
framework
that
we have developed
thus
allows
us
to make
the nature
of
generational
innovation precise.
Proximity alignment
appears
to
be
a minor
innovation.
The components,
system parameters
and user needs met
by
the aligner
remained unchanged.
Yet
the
relationships between
the components,
system
parameters
and
user needs changed dramatically.
An apparpntly
small

in
a

important

in

Established

the experience
that
they
had gained with
incremental
innovation
in
the previous

the

they
had
accumulated
- made
it
very difficult
for
them
to understand
the
nature
of
the generational
innovations with which
they were
faced
or
to shape
an appropriate
response.
We
illustrate
this here
by
a description
of Kasper's
failure
to maintain
its
position
in proximity alignment.
This
failure
is particularly intprpsting since
the
firm was
relatively small
and "organic"
in structurp
and
since
thp
introduction
of proximity alignment
appears
to
be
so similar
to
the
introduction
of
an incremental
innovation.
It
illustrates graphically
the ways
in which subtle
changes
in
the
i nterrplationships
of
components,
system parameters
and
user needs
can have very significant
i^ompetitive
implications.
Kasper Instruments was

in

and
by
1971 was
a
small
but
profitablp
firm supplying approximately half
of
the

1973 Kasper introduced

Kasper
alignprs wpip nnlv
rarely nspd
in prnximity
mode,
and
sales declined steadily until
the
company
left
the
indnstry
in
1*181.
The
widespread
use
of proximity aligners
did
not
occur until
the introduction
and
general
adoption of Canon's proximity aligner
in
the
late
197ns.
Rasper's
failure
is
initially pu77ling given
its established
position
in
the
market
and
its depth
of experience
in photolithography.
There were
approvimat el
y
five key mechanical
and
electronic
engineers
at
Kasper during
the early
197ns.
Several
of
them were highly skilled
and
i'T'aginat ive designers,
and
the group
designed
a
steady stream
of contact
aligners,
each
incorporating significant
incremental
improvements.
From
19(^8
to
1973
the minimum feature
siT^e capability
nf
the contact
aligner improved
from
ten
to
five microns.
But
Kasper''^
very success
in designing contact
aligners was
a
i^iajor
contributor
to
their inability
to design
a
proximity aligner
that
could
perform
as
successfully
as Canon's.
Canon's aligner was superficially very similar
to
Rasper's.
Tt
incorporated
the same components
and performed
the
same
functions,
but
it
performed
them much more effectively since
it
incorpoiafed
a much more
sophisticated understanding
of
the
technical
interrelationships
that
are
fundamental
to successful
proximity alignment.
Rasper
failed
to develop
the
particular specialist
knowledge
that would have enabled
their'
to match Canon's
design,
but,
even more
importantly,
their
experien<:'p with contact
aligners
left
them without
the knowledge gathering
routines
that
would have
enabled
them
to
understand
the
need
to acquire
it.
The
relational
knowledge
that
they had
developed
through
their experience with contact
aligners had
the
effect
of
fooising
their attention away
from
the
new problems whose solution was critical
to
the design
of
a
successful
proximity aligner.
Kasper conceived
of
the proximity aligner
as
a nndified
contact
aligner,
and
it
was managed
as
a
rovitlne extension
to
the product
line,
just
as
the
previous
incremental
improvements
to
the contact
aligner had been.

But,
as
thp analysis
that
wp prpspntpd
ahovp
rnadp
c]par,
pioxirrity alignment
represents
a generational
shift
in alignnpnt
tpchnology.
In particular,
the
intprrplationships between
the performance
of
the
gap setting mechanism and
the
minimum feature
si:^e capability
of
the aligopr
are quite
different
in
a proximity
and contact
aligner.
In
a contact
aligner,
the
gap
SPtting mpchanism
is
uspd
only
dui ing
alignment.
Errors
in
its setting
can
be corrected manually,
and
its accuracv has
little
influence over minimum feature
si?^e capability.
B\it
in
a
proximity aligner
the quality of
the transmitted
image
is critically dependent
\ipon
the
gap's
accuracy
and
stability,
and
minimurri feature
si?e capability
is
a
dirpct
function
of
its size and
accuracy.
As
rpsult
thp
succpssful
design
of
a proximity aligner
requires both
the acquisition
of
some
new knowledge
- how
to build
an
adequate gap
setting mechanism
-
and
an understanding
of
some new interactions between
component
performance and
the system parampters
of
the
alignpr
-
in particular an
understanding
that
minimium feature
size capability
is
limited
by
the
rpsolution
and
critical
dimpnsion control
of
thp
alignpr,
and
that
in
turn resolution
and
critical
dimension control
are critically dependent
upon
the accuracy and
uniformity
of
the gap betwpen
the mask
and
the wafer.
Thp successful
dpsign
of
an adequatp

is
not
a
trivial
task.

that

Tn
a proximity aligner,
the mask must
be
located
by
"dead
reckoning"
at
some
point
in space
above
the wafpr,
and
the designer must
rely
on
the accuracy
of
the mpchanical mpchanism

pnsure
that

Kasper
lacked

or,
in
the
terTn<^
of onr framework,
lacked
the
ability
to control

The design group
at
Kasper had
not

tn develop
this
type
of knowledge
since
it
was
not
critical
to
the performance
of
the early
contact
aligners.
But

More critically.
Kasper continued
to make use
of
the problem solving
and
information gathering strategies
that
they had developed during
their experience
with
the contact
aligner,
and
as
a
result
failed
tn understand
the
need
to develop
this critical
body of knowledge.
Tanon
invested heavily
in building
a deep
understanding
of
the precise
relationships between
errors
in
the
gap setting
mechanism,
the stability and uniformity
of
the source,
and
the performance
of
the
alignment
system
in
the determination
of
the
resolution
and critical
dimension
control
of
the
aligner.
This
enabled
them
to make
informed
tradeoffs
in
the
overall
design
of
the system,
and
to understand,
for example,
where design
effort
could
be most
fruitfully spent.
Kasper did
not
do
this.
They assumed
that
the
introduction
of
a
gap between
the mask
and
the wafer during alignment
was
a
minor,
incremental
change
and
so
put
little
effort
into understanding
the
new
interactions
that
it
created between
the gap setting mpchanism and
re'^olutlon
and
critical
dimension control.
Thus
they
failed
to
under'^tand
the enormous
impact
that
improvements
in
its accuracy and
precision could have
on
the
perfor-^iance

K.aspey 's
failure
to understand
the ohsnlesrenre
nf
their
relational
knowledge
is demonstrated graphirally
hy
two
incidents.
The
first
is
the
firii^'s
interpretation
of
early complaints
about
the accuracy
of
its
gap
setting
mechanism.
In proximity
alignment
misalignment
of
the
fnask
niid
the wafer can hp
caused
both
hv inaccuracies
or instability
in
the
gap setting mechanism and
by
distortions
introduced
during processing,
Kasppr
at-tributpd many
of
the
pvr)blems
that
usprs
of
its proximity equipment
were eyppripncing
to processing
error,
since
they "knew"
f rniTi
their experience with
fhe contact
aligner
that
their
gap setting
mechanism was adequate
to
the
task.
As
a
result
they devoted
vpry
little
time
to
improving
its performance.
In
retrospect
this may
sppt'
likp
a
wanton misusp
of
information,
but
it
represented
no more
than
a
continued
reliance
on
an
information
filter
that
had
served
them well
historically.
The
cppond
illustration
is provided
by
their
response
to Canon's
initial
introduction.
The ranon aligner
was evaluated
by
a
team
at Kasper
and pronounced
to be
a
"copy
of
a
K.asper
machine." Kasper evaluated
it
against
the criteria
that
they used
for evaluating
their own aligners
- criteria
that
had been developed d"ring
their
expprience with
contact
aligners.
Thp
tpchnical
features
that made
it
a significant
advance,
particularly
the
redesigned
gap mechanism,
were
not
observed because
they were not
considered
important.
Kasper 's
engineers were
not
incompetent.
They assumed
that
the core design
concepts
that
underlay
the design
of
their contact
aligners could
a1«o
serve
as
the basis
for
a proximity aligner,
and
that
the
relational
knowledge
and
the
knowledge processing capabilities
that
they had accumulated
dtiring
their
experience with contact
aligners could
be
transfprrpd
to proximity
aliguprc.
Kasper's commercial
failure
stemriied
from more
than
this
failure
in design.
The company had problems designing
