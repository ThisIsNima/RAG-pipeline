Reinforcemen

Mo
del
In

mo

an
agen
t
is
connected
to
its
en
vironmen

via
p
erception
and
action,
as
depicted
in
Figure
.
On
eac
h
step
of
in

the
agen
t
receiv
es
as
input,
i,
some
indication
of
the
curren
t
state,
s,
of
the
en
vironmen
t;
the
agen
t
then
c
ho
oses
an
action,
a,
to
generate
as
output.
The
action
c
hanges
the
state
of
the
en
vironmen
t,
and
the
v
alue
of
this
state
transition
is
comm
unicated
to
the
agen
t
through
a
scalar
r
einfor
c

signal,
r
.
The
agen

B
,
should
c
ho
ose
actions
that
tend
to
increase
the
long-run
sum
of

of
the
reinforcemen

signal.
It

diers
from
the
more
widely
studied
problem
of
sup
ervised
learn-
ing
in

eral
w
a
ys.
The
most
imp
ortan
t
dierence
is
that
there
is
no
presen
tation
of
in-
put/output
pairs.
Instead,
after
c
ho
osing
an

the
agen

is
told
the
immediate
rew

and
the
subsequen

It
is
necessary
for
the

exp

ab
out
the
p

system

actions,
transitions
and
rew

to

.
Another
dierence
from
sup
ervised

is
that
on-line
p

is
imp

t:
the
ev

of

in

one
of
the

In

The

is
the
easiest
to

ab

at
a
giv

the

optimize

;
it

This
mo

In
the
rst,
the
agen

will
ha

a
non-stationary

that
is,
one
that
c

On
its
rst
step
it
will
tak
e
what
is
termed
a

optimal
action.
This
is
dened
to
b
e
the
b
est
action
a

en
that
it
has
h
steps
remaining

On
the
next
step
it
will

a
(h

optimal
action,
and
so
on,
un
til
it
nally
tak
es
a
-step
optimal

and
terminates.
In

The

In

in

The

will,
in
man

cases,
transfer
to
the
more
complex
instances
of

discussed

in
the

The
simplest
p

is

of

(Berry

The

is
in

An

The
mac

do
not

the
only

is
in

What

b

This
problem
illustrates
the
fundamen

tradeo

w

exploitation
and
exploration.
The
agen

migh
t
b

should

all

or
should
it
c

another
one
that
it
has
less
information
ab
out,
but
seems
to
b

w

Answ
ers
to
these
questions
dep
end
on
ho

long
the
agen

is
exp

pla

the

the
longer
the
game
lasts,
the
w

the
consequences
of
prematurely
con
v

on
a
sub-optimal
arm,
and
the
more
the
agen

should
explore.
There

..
Greed
y
Stra
tegies
The
rst
strategy
that
comes
to
mind
is
to
alw
a
ys
c
ho
ose
the
action
with
the
highest
esti-
mated
pa
y
o.
The
a
w
is
that
early
unluc
ky
sampling
migh
t
indicate
that
the
b
est
action's
rew
ard
is
less
than
the
rew
ard
obtained
from
a
sub
optimal
action.
The
sub
optimal
action
will
alw
a
ys

ving
the
true
optimal

and
its
sup
eriorit
y
nev
er
disco
v
ered.
An
agen
t
m
ust
explore
to
ameliorate
this
outcome.
A
useful
heuristic
is
optimism
in
the
fac
e
of
unc
ertainty
in
whic
h
actions
are
selected
greedily
,
but
strongly
optimistic
prior
b
eliefs
are
put
on
their
pa
y
os
so
that
strong
negativ
e
evidence
is
needed
to
eliminate
an
action
from
consideration.
This
still
has
a
measurable
danger
of
starving
an
optimal
but
unluc
ky
action,
but
the
risk
of
this
can
b
e
made
arbitrar-
ily
small.
T
ec

this

Randomized

Another
simple
exploration
strategy
is
to
tak
e
the
action

the
b

estimated
exp

b
y

but
with
probabilit
y

c
ho
ose
an
action
at

Some
v
ersions
of
this
strategy
start
with
a
large
v
alue
of
p
to
encourage
initial
exploration,
whic
h
is
slo
wly
decreased.
An
ob
jection
to
the
simple
strategy
is
that
when
it
exp
erimen
ts
with
a
non-greedy
action
it
is
no
more
lik
ely
to
try
a
promising
alternativ
e
than
a
clearly
hop
eless
alternativ
e.
A
sligh
tly
more
sophisticated
strategy
is
Boltzmann
explor
ation.
In
this
case,
the
exp
ected
rew
ard
for
taking
action
a,
E
R(a)
is
used
to

The

to
decrease

This
metho
d
w

if
the
b
est
action
is
w

separated
from
the
others,
but
suers
somewhat
when
the
v

of
the
actions
are

It

Dela

ed
Rew

In

case
of

the
agen

actions
determine
not
only
its
immediate
rew

but
also
(at
least
probabilistically)
the
next
state
of
the
en
vironmen

Suc

as

as

The

This

The

is
quadratic
in
the

and
linear
in
the

Com-
monly
,
the

T
(s;

are
sparse.
If

are

with

then
the

is
linear
in
the
n
um
b

of
states
and
linear
in
the
n

b

The
n

required
to

the

is

Adaptiv

Critic
and

()
The
adaptive
heuristic
critic
algorithm
is
an
adaptiv
e
v
ersion
of
p
olicy
iteration
(Barto,
Sutton,
&
Anderson,
	)
in
whic
h
the
v
alue-function
computation
is
no
longer
imple-
men
ted
b
y
solving
a
set
of
linear
equations,
but
is
instead
computed
b
y
an
algorithm
called
T
D
(0).
A
blo
c
k
diagram
for
this
approac
h
is
giv
en
in
Figure
.
It
consists
of
t
w
o
comp
o-
nen
ts:
a
critic
(lab
eled
AHC),
and
a
reinforcemen
t-learning
comp
onen
t
(lab
eled
RL).
The
reinforcemen
t-learning
comp
onen
t
can
b
e
an
instance
of
an
y
of
the
k
-armed
bandit
algo-
rithms,
mo
died
to
deal
with
m
ultiple
states
and
non-stationary
rew
ards.
But
instead
of
acting
to
maximize
instan
taneous
rew
ard,
it
will
b
e
acting
to
maximize
the
heuristic
v
alue,
v
,
that
is
computed
b
y
the
critic.
The
critic
uses
the
real
external
reinforcemen
t
signal
to
learn
to
map
states
to
their
exp

discoun

the
p

b
eing
executed
is
the
one
curren

in
the
RL

t.
W
e
can
see
the
analogy
with
mo
died
p
olicy
iteration
if
w
e
imagine
these
comp

ts
w

in

The

b
y
RL
is
xed
and
the
critic
learns
the
v
alue
function
V

for
that
p
olicy
.
No
w
w
e
x
the
critic
and
let
the
RL
comp
onen
t
learn
a
new
p

that
maximizes
the
new
v

function,
and
so

(Williams

Baird,

It
remains
to
explain
ho
w
the
critic
can
learn
the
v

of
a

Here
s

r
the

and

its

The
v

of
a

is
learned
using
Sutton's
T

(Sutton,

whic

This

The

a

Q-learning
The
w

of
the

of
AHC
can
b

accomplished
in
a
unied

y
W
atkins'
Q-learning
algorithm
(W
atkins,
		;
W
atkins
&
Da
y
an,
		).
Q-learning
is
t
ypically
easier
to
implemen
t.
In
order
to
understand
Q-learning,
w
e
ha
v
e
to
dev
elop
some
additional
notation.
Let
Q

of
taking
action
a
in

then
con

c

Note
that
V

(s)
is
the
v

of
s
assuming
the
b
est
action
is
tak
en
initially
,
and
so
V

(s)
=
max
a
Q

(s;
a).
Q

(s;
a)
can
hence
b
e
written
recursiv
ely
as
Q

(s;
a)
=
R(s;

+

X
s

S
T
(s;
a;
s

)
max
a
0
Q

(s
0
;
a
0
)
:
Note
also
that,
since
V

(s)
=
max
a
Q

(s;

w
e
ha
v
e


(s)
=
arg
max
a
Q

(s;
a)
as
an
optimal
p

.
Because
the
Q
function
mak
es
the
action
explicit,
w
e
can
estimate
the
Q
v
alues
on-
line
using
a
metho
d
essen
tially
the
same
as
T
D
(0),
but
also

them
to

ecause
an

c

just
b
y
taking
the
one
with
the
maxim
um
Q
v
alue
for
the
curren

The
Q-learning
rule
is
Q(s;

:=
Q(s;

+
(r

a

Q(s

;
where
hs;
a;
r
;
s
0
i
is
an
exp
erience
tuple
as
describ
ed
earlier.
If
eac
h
action
is
executed
in
eac
h
state
an
innite
n
um
b
er
of
times
on
an
innite

and

is
deca
y
ed
appropriately
,
the
Q
v
alues
will
con
v
erge
with
probabilit
y

to
Q

(W
atkins,
		;
Tsitsiklis,
		;
Jaakk
ola,
Jordan,
&
Singh,
		).
Q-learning
can
also
b
e
extended
to
up
date
states
that
o
ccurred
more
than
one
step
previously
,
as
in
T
D
()
(P
eng
&
Williams,
		).
When
the
Q
v
alues
are
nearly
con
v
erged
to
their
optimal
v
alues,
it
is
appropriate
for
the
agen
t
to
act
greedily
,
taking,
in
eac
h
situation,
the
action
with
the
highest
Q
v
alue.
During
learning,
ho
w
ev
er,
there
is
a
dicult
exploitation
v
ersus
exploration
trade-o
to
b
e
made.
There
are
no
go
o
d,
formally
justied
approac
hes
to
this
problem
in
the
general
case;
standard
practice
is
to
adopt
one
of
the
ad
ho
c
metho
ds
discussed
in
section
..
AHC
arc
hitectures
seem
to
b
e
more
dicult
to
w
ork
with
than
Q-learning
on
a
practical
lev
el.
It
can
b
e
hard
to
get
the
relativ
e
learning
rates
righ
t
in
AHC
so
that
the
t
w
o
comp
onen
ts
con
v
erge
together.
In
addition,
Q-learning
is
explor
ation
insensitive:
that
is,
that
the
Q
v
alues
will
con
v
erge
to
the
optimal
v
alues,
indep
enden
t
of
ho
w
the
agen
t
b
eha
v
es
while
the
data
is
b
eing
collected
(as
long
as
all
state-action
pairs
are
tried
often
enough).
This
means
that,
although
the
exploration-exploitation
issue
m
ust
b
e
addressed
in
Q-learning,
the
details
of
the
exploration
strategy
will
not
aect
the
con
v
ergence
of
the
learning
algorithm.
F
or
these
reasons,
Q-learning
is
the
most
p
opular
and
seems
to
b
e
the
most
eectiv
e
mo

for

Surely
,
therefore,
there
should

CRBP
The

reinforcemen

bac

algorithm
(Ac

&
Littman,

(crbp)
consists
of
a
feed-forw
ard
net
w
ork
mapping
an
enco
ding
of
the
state
to
an
enco
ding
of
the
action.
The
action
is
determined
probabilistically
from
the
activ
ation
of
the
output
units:
if
output
unit
i
has
activ
ation
y
i
,
then
bit
i
of
the
action
v
ector
has
v
alue

with
probabilit
y
y
i
,
and
0
otherwise.
An
y
neural-net
w
ork
sup
ervised
training
pro
cedure
can
b
e
used
to
adapt
the
net
w
ork
as
follo
ws.
If
the
result
of
generating
action
a
is
r
=
,
then
the
net
w
ork
is
trained
with
input-output
pair
hs;
ai.
If
the
result
is
r
=
0,
then
the
net
w

is
trained
with
input-output

hs;

a
i,
where

a
=
(
 a

;

n
).
The
idea
b
ehind
this
training
rule
is
that
whenev
er
an
action
fails
to
generate
rew
ard,
crbp
will
try
to
generate
an
action
that
is
dieren
t
from
the
curren
t
c

Although
it
seems
lik
e
the
algorithm
migh
t
oscillate
b
et
w
een
an
action
and
its
complemen
t,
that
do
es
not
happ
en.
One
step
of
training
a
net
w
ork
will
only
c
hange
the
action
sligh
tly
and
since
the
output
probabilities
will
tend
to
mo
v
e
to
w
ard
0.,
this
mak
es
action
selection
more
random
and
increases
searc

The
hop
e
is
that
the
random
distribution
will
generate
an
action
that
w

and
then
that
action
will
b

In

The

This

Another

A

When

When

An

This

in

again,
there

It
is
reasonable,
though,
to
ask
what
the

It

Some
in

asp
ects
of
practical
reinforcemen

come
to
ligh
t
from
these

The
most
striking
is
that
in
all
cases,
to
mak

a

w

it
pro
v
ed
necessary
to
supplemen

kno
wledge.
Supplying
extra
kno
wledge
comes
at
a
price:
more
h
uman
eort
and
insigh
t
is
required
and
the
system
is
subsequen
tly
less
autonomous.
But
it
is
also
clear
that
for

suc

as
these,
a

What
forms
did
this
pre-programmed
kno
wledge
tak
e?
It
included
an
assumption
of
linearit
y
for
the
juggling
rob
ot's

,
a
man
ual
breaking
up
of
the

in

for
the

while
the

a

whic
h
assumed

t
Q
v
alues.
The
four
disk-collecting
rob
ots
additionally
used
a
man
ually
discretized
state

The
pac
k
aging
example
had
far
few
er
dimensions
and
so
required
corresp
ondingly
w
eak
er
assumptions,
but
there,
to
o,
the
as-
sumption
of
lo
cal
piecewise
con
tin
uit
y
in
the
transition
mo

enabled
massiv
e
reductions
in
the
amoun

of

required.
The
exploration
strategies
are
in

The

The

used
optimism
in
the
face
of

.
None
of
these
strategies
mirrors
theoretically
optimal
(but
computationally
in

exploration,
and
y
et

Finally
,
it
