Quantum networks oﬀer a unifying set of opportunities and challenges across exciting intellec-
tual and technical frontiers, including for quantum computation, communication, and metrology.
The realization of quantum networks composed of many nodes and channels requires new scien-
tiﬁc capabilities for the generation and characterization of quantum coherence and entanglement.
Fundamental to this endeavor are quantum interconnects that convert quantum states from one
physical system to those of another in a reversible fashion. Such quantum connectivity for networks
can be achieved by optical interactions of single photons and atoms, thereby enabling entanglement
distribution and quantum teleportation between nodes.
INTRODUCTION
The past two decades have witnessed a wide range of fundamental discoveries in quantum information science (QIS),
ranging from a quantum algorithm that places public-key cryptography at risk to a protocol for the teleportation
of quantum states [1]. This union of quantum mechanics and information science has fostered great advances in
our understanding of the quantum world and in our ability to control coherently individual quantum systems [2].
Unique capabilities of quantum systems to process and distribute information have been identiﬁed, and powerful new
perspectives for understanding the complexity and subtleties of quantum dynamical phenomena have emerged.
Within the broad context of QIS, quantum networks play an important role, both for the formal analysis and the
physical implementation of quantum computation, communication, and metrology [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Figure 1(a) illustrates
a notional quantum network based upon the original proposals in Refs. [4, 7]. To create a quantum network, quantum
information is generated, processed, and stored locally in quantum nodes. These nodes are linked by quantum channels
that transport quantum states from site to site with high ﬁdelity and that distribute entanglement across the entire
network. With relatively modest processing capabilities, one could even envision a ‘quantum internet’ that could
accomplish tasks that are otherwise impossible within the realm of classical physics, including the distribution of
‘quantum software’ [8, 9].
Apart from any particular algorithm, there is an important advantage to be gained from quantum as opposed to
classical connectivity between nodes [10]. A network of quantum nodes linked by classical channels comprised of k
nodes each with n qubits has a state space of dimension k2n, whereas a fully quantum network linked by quantum
channels has an exponentially larger dimension 2kn. Quantum connectivity also provides a potentially powerful means
to overcome size-scaling and error-correlation problems that would otherwise limit the size of machines for quantum
processing [11]. At any stage in the development of quantum technologies, there will be a largest size attainable for
individual quantum processing units, which can be superseded by linking such units together into a fully quantum
network.
A quite diﬀerent perspective of a quantum network is to view the nodes as components of a physical system
that interact by way of the quantum channels. In this case, the underlying physical processes used for quantum
network protocols are adapted to simulate the evolution of quantum many-body systems [12]. For example, atoms
localized at separate nodes can have eﬀective “spin – spin” interactions catalyzed by single-photon pulses that travel
along the channels between the nodes [13]. The “quantum wiring” of the network allows a wide range for the eﬀective
Hamiltonian and topology of the resulting “lattice”. Moreover, the extension of entanglement across quantum networks
can be related to the classical problem of percolation [14].
These exciting opportunities motivate an examination of research related to the actual physical processes for
translating the abstract illustration in Fig. 1(a) into reality. From diverse activities worldwide, I will narrow the
focus to provide an overview of current eﬀorts and prospects for harnessing optical processes at the level of single
photons and atoms for the reliable transport of quantum states across complex quantum networks. In this context,
we require that quantum states of a material system be mapped to and from propagating optical ﬁelds as illustrated
in Fig. 1(b), thereby achieving quantum connectivity for the network, including entanglement to enable quantum
teleportation between nodes.
Such considerations are timely since scientiﬁc capabilities are now passing the threshold from a learning phase
with individual systems over the past ﬁfteen years and are advancing into a domain of rudimentary functionality for

quantum nodes connected by quantum channels. From a broad spectrum of remarkable achievements, two important
areas on which I will focus are strong coupling of single photons and atoms within the setting of cavity quantum
electrodynamics (QED) [15] and quantum information processing with atomic ensembles [16]. Critical to both these
examples are long-lived quantum memories provided by the atomic system and eﬃcient light-matter interfaces.
I apologize at the outset for my sins of omission related to alternative approaches.
In these early days, it is
impossible to foresee which of many exciting possibilities might lead to rudimentary networks with nontrivial sci-
entiﬁc capabilities much less to functional systems of technological signiﬁcance. Many physical systems are being
investigated as surveyed in Ref. [2] and described at the following websites: http://qist.lanl.gov/qcomp map.shtml,
http://www.scala-ip.org/public/, and http://www.qubitapplications.com/. However, my purpose is not to present an
exhaustive set of detailed descriptions, but rather to convey basic principles for physical implementations of quantum
networks by way of a few examples in Quantum Optics. I strive thereby to stimulate the involvement of a larger
community in this endeavor, including for systems-level studies.
A QUANTUM INTERFACE BETWEEN LIGHT AND MATTER
The principal scientiﬁc challenge in the quest to distribute quantum states across a quantum network is the at-
tainment of coherent control over the interactions of light and matter at the single-photon level. Whereas atoms and
electrons have relatively large long-range interactions for their spin and charge degrees of freedom, individual photons
have interaction cross-sections that are typically orders of magnitude too small for nontrivial dynamics when coupled
to single degrees of freedom for a material system.
The endeavor to address this issue began in the optical physics community in the 1990s with the development of
theoretical protocols for the coherent transfer of quantum states between atoms and photons within the setting of
cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) [7, 17, 18]. Other important advances have been made in the past decade,
including with atomic ensembles [16, 19, 20]. The reversible mapping of quantum states between light and matter
provides the basis for quantum-optical interconnects and is a fundamental primitive for building quantum networks.
Although the original schemes for such interconnects are fragile to experimental imperfections, a complete set of
theoretical protocols have subsequently been developed for the robust distribution of quantum information over
quantum networks, including, quite signiﬁcantly, the invention of the quantum repeater [4, 21] and scalable quantum
networks with atomic ensembles [16].
Fig. 1(b) illustrates a generic quantum interface between light and matter described by the interaction Hamiltonian
Hint(t), where for typical states ⟨Hint(t)⟩∼ℏχ(t), with χ(t) the time-dependent coupling strength between the
internal material system and the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Desiderata for a quantum interface include that χ(t) should
be “user-controlled” for clocking states to and from the quantum memory (e.g., by way of an auxiliary laser), that
the physical processes employed should be robust in the face of imperfections (e.g., by adiabatic transfer), and that
mistakes should be eﬃciently detected and ﬁxed (e.g., with quantum error correction). In qualitative terms, the rate
κ which characterizes the bandwidth of the input-output channel should be large compared to the rate γ for any
parasitic losses, and both these rates should be small compared to the rate of coherent coupling, χ ≫κ ≫γ.
Two speciﬁc examples of physical systems to realize a quantum interface and distribute coherence and entanglement
between nodes are shown in Fig. 1(c), (d). In the case of Fig. 1(c), single atoms are trapped within optical cavities at
nodes A, B which are linked by an optical ﬁber. External ﬁelds control the transfer of the quantum state |ψ⟩stored
in the atom at node A to the atom at node B by way of photons that propagate from A to B [7, 22]. In Fig. 1(d), a
single photon pulse generated at node A is coherently split into two components and propagates to nodes B, C, where
the entangled photon state is coherently mapped into an entangled state between collective excitations at the two
nodes [16, 19, 20, 23]. Subsequent readout of entanglement from either or both of the memories at B, C to photon
pulses is implemented at the push of a button.
In the sections that follow, I will elaborate in somewhat more detail the underlying physical processes for the
implementation of quantum-optical interconnects between matter and light. Particular attention will be given to the
two examples in Fig. 1(c), (d).
CAVITY QUANTUM ELECTRODYNAMICS
At the forefront of the endeavor to achieve strong, coherent interactions between light and matter has been the
area of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) [24]. In both the optical [15, 25] and microwave [26, 27, 28, 29, 30]
domains, strong coupling of single atoms and photons has been achieved by utilizing electromagnetic resonators of

quantum dots coupled to micropillars and photonic bandgap cavities [32, 33, 34, 35] and Cooper-pairs interacting
with superconducting resonators (i.e., ‘circuit’ QED reviewed in Ref. [36]).

The supporting structure serves for active servo control of the cavity length to δl ≃10−14 m [15]. (c) Critical photon number

Quantum Optics Group. These experiments involve both spherical mirror Fabry-Perot cavities (circles) and the whispering
gallery modes of monolithic SiO2 resonators (squares). The points in 2006, 2008 are from Refs. [43, 44] demonstrated for a
SiO2 microtoroidal resonator, while those in 2009, 2011 are projections for a microtoroid [45].
Figure 2(a, b) depicts a single atom located inside an optical resonator, for which strong coupling of atom and
photon requires that a single intracavity photon creates a “large” electric ﬁeld. Stated more quantitatively, if the

in cavity QED explore strong coupling with g ≫(γ, κ), where γ is the atomic decay rate to modes other than the
cavity mode and κ is the decay rate of the cavity mode itself. Expressed in the language of traditional optical physics,
the number of photons required to saturate the intracavity atom is n0 ∼γ2/g2, and the number of atoms required
to have an appreciable eﬀect on the intracavity ﬁeld is N0 ∼κγ/g2. Strong coupling in cavity QED moves beyond
traditional optical physics for which (n0, N0) ≫1 to explore a qualitatively new regime with (n0, N0) ≪1 [15].
A variety of approaches have been employed to achieve strong coupling in cavity QED over the past three decades,
with reviews of much of the early work available in Ref.[24]. Of particular note in the development of this ﬁeld were the
pioneering experiments of H. Walther [26], who combined Rydberg atoms with superconducting cavities (Q ∼1010)
to advance cavity QED into a regime of strong coupling in the microwave domain [28, 29]. A recent spectacular
achievement is the observation of the step-by-step collapse of the quantum state of an intracavity microwave ﬁeld [30].
In the optical domain, a route to strong coupling is the use of high-ﬁnesse optical resonators (F ∼105 −106) and
atomic transitions with large ⃗µ0 (i.e., oscillator strengths near unity). Figure 2(c) provides an illustration of progress
along this avenue, with research now well into the domain (n0, N0) ≪1.
Of course as the cavity volume Vm is reduced to increase g as in Eq. 1, the requirement for atomic localization
necessarily becomes more stringent. Not surprisingly, central to activities in cavity QED over the past decade have
been eﬀorts to trap and localize atoms within high-ﬁnesse optical cavities in a regime of strong coupling, with the
initial demonstration in 1999 [37]. Subsequent advances are reviewed in Ref. [38], including trap lifetimes ≳10 s
[39, 40]. Quantum control has now been achieved over both internal (i.e., atomic dipole and cavity ﬁeld) and external
(i.e., atomic motion) degrees of freedom for a strongly coupled atom-cavity system [41]. An exciting prospect is cavity
QED with single trapped ions, where the boundary for strong coupling has been reached [42].
Coherence and entanglement in cavity QED
An application of these capabilities to quantum networks is the generation of single photons “on demand” (see Box
1). By way of strong coupling of the cavity ﬁeld to an atomic transition, an external control ﬁeld Ω(t) transfers one
photon into the cavity mode and thence to free-space by way of the cavity output mirror, leading to a single-photon
pulse |φ1(t)⟩as a collimated beam. The temporal structure (amplitude and phase) of the resulting “ﬂying photon”
|φ1(t)⟩can be tailored by way of the control ﬁeld Ω(t) [7, 46, 47], with the spatial structure of the wavepacket set by
the cavity mode ψ(⃗r).
Several experiments have conﬁrmed the essential aspects of this process for the deterministic generation of single
photons [39, 42, 48]. Signiﬁcantly, in the ideal, adiabatic limit, the atomic excited state |e⟩is not populated [49].
By deterministically generating a bit stream of single-photon pulses from single, trapped atoms, these experiments
provide a ﬁrst step in the evolution of quantum networks based upon ﬂying photons.
Relative to single-photon generation by diverse other systems [50], a distinguishing aspect of the dark-state protocol
discussed in Box 1 is that it should be reversible, so that a photon emitted from one system A can be eﬃciently
transferred to another system B by simply applying the time-reversed (and suitably delayed) ﬁeld Ω(t) at B, as
illustrated in Figure 1(c).
Such an advance was reported in Ref. [22] by implementing the reversible mapping of a coherent optical ﬁeld
to and from internal states of a single, trapped Cesium atom.
As described by Eq.
2 in Box 1, the incident
ﬁeld |φfield(t)⟩∼c0 |0⟩field + c1 |1⟩field was approximated by a coherent state λ(t) with ¯n = 1.1 photons and was
transferred into a coherent superposition of atomic states. The stored atomic state was then coherently mapped
back into a propagating ﬁeld β(t). Although there were imperfections in this experiment [22], it provides the initial
veriﬁcation of the fundamental primitive upon which the protocol in Ref. [7] is based.
The discussion in Box 1 as well as related possibilities [13, 47] rely upon strong coupling between an atom and
a single polarization of the intracavity ﬁeld. However, by extending these ideas to the two polarization eigenmodes
of the cavity for a given TEM00 longitudinal mode, it is possible to generate entanglement between internal atomic
states and the polarization state of a coherently generated photon [51, 52, 53]. An initial control ﬁeld Ω1(t1) results in
an entangled state between internal states of the atom |b±⟩and the polarization state of a ﬂying photon

coherently generated by the coupled atom-cavity system. Application of a second control ﬁeld Ω2(t2) returns the atom

, thereby leading to entanglement
between the polarizations σ± of the two ﬁelds φ±

field emitted at times t1, t2.
Precisely such a sequence of operations Ω1,2(t1,2) has been applied to single Rubidium atoms falling through a high-
ﬁnesse optical cavity [25]. In an experimental tour de force, these authors were able to create entangled photons with
time separation τ = t2 −t1 limited by the atomic transit time. Although the atoms arrived randomly, the protocol

itself is intrinsically deterministic and represents a signiﬁcant advance toward the generation and distribution of
entangled states for quantum networking. With trapped atoms, it will be possible to generate entangled states at user
selected times (t1, t2) at the “push of button.” Moreover, the scheme is inherently reversible, so that the entangled
state between atom and ﬁeld can be used to distribute entanglement to a second atom-cavity system in a network.
In a broader context, important advances have been made in the generation and transfer of quantum states with
other physical systems. For example, single photons generated by a quantum dot coupled to a photonic-bandgap cavity
have been transmitted to a second, ‘target’ cavity via an on-chip waveguide [54]. Ref. [36] reviews the spectacular
progress made in wiring quantum circuits by way of superconducting microwave cavities and coherent transmission
along a quantum bus.
This discussion provides a preview of coming experimental advances towards the realization of quantum networks
based upon interactions in cavity QED. Diverse theoretical protocols have been developed but have awaited the
maturation of experimental capabilities, which we are now witnessing.
Included are the sequential generation of
entangled multiqubit states [55], the teleportation of atomic states from one node to another [18], photonic quantum
computation by photon-photon interactions at the nodes [47], and reversible mapping of quantum states of atomic
motion to and from light [56]. Certainly, new technical capabilities beyond conventional Fabry-Perot cavities will be
required to enable such scientiﬁc investigations, with Box 2 discussing some candidate systems.
QUANTUM NETWORKS WITH ATOMIC ENSEMBLES
An area of considerable activity in the quest to distribute coherence and entanglement across quantum networks
has been the interaction of light with atomic ensembles comprised of a large collection of identical atoms. For the
regime of continuous variables, entanglement has been achieved between two atomic ensembles each consisting of
∼1012 atoms [67], and quantum teleportation of light to matter demonstrated for the mapping of coherent optical
states to the collective spin states of an atomic memory [68]. More general activities in this area are covered in Ref.
[69].
Here, I will focus instead on the regime of discrete variables with photons and atomic excitations taken one by one.
Research in this area is based upon the remarkable theoretical protocol in Ref. [16] (hereafter referred to as ‘DLCZ’),
which presented a realistic scheme for entanglement distribution by way of a quantum-repeater architecture [4, 21].
Fundamental to the DLCZ protocol is the generation and retrieval of single ‘spin’ excitations within an ensemble
of a large number of atoms (see Box 3) [70]. In concert with photoelectric detection, a ﬁrst laser pulse creates a
single excitation |1a⟩stored collectively within the atomic ensemble. At a later time, a second pulse deterministically
converts excitation stored within the atomic memory in the state |1a⟩into a propagating ﬁeld, denoted as ﬁeld 2.
The basic processes illustrated in Box 3 can be extended to create an entangled pair of ensembles as in Fig. 3(a) [16].
A pair of ensembles L, R is illuminated by separate write pulses, leading to the overall state |φL,R⟩=
φL

where

are entangled states between atomic excitation and photon number for ﬁeld 1 for the L, R
ensembles (see Eq.
1 in Box 3).
The scattered ﬁelds 1L, 1R from the two ensembles are combined on a 50-50
beamsplitter, with outputs directed to two photodetectors D1, D2.
In the ideal case and to lowest order in p, a
photoelectric detection event at either detector projects the ensembles into the entangled state
|ΨL,R⟩=
1
√
2[|0a⟩L |1a⟩R ± eiη1 |1a⟩L |0a⟩R],
(2)
with the sign + or −set by whether D1 or D2 records the event. The phase η1 is determined by the diﬀerence of
phase shifts along the two channels, η1 = βL −βR [71], which must be stable.
The state |ΨL,R⟩is generated in a probabilistic but heralded fashion from quantum interference in the measurement
process [72, 73, 74]. That is, detection of a photon from one or the other atomic ensemble in an indistinguishable
fashion results in an entangled state with one collective spin excitation shared coherently between the ensembles.
Necessarily, because p ≪1, any given trial with the write pulses is unlikely to produce a detection event at D1, D2,
with such failed trials requiring the system to be reinitialized. However, a photoelectric detection event at D1, D2
unambiguously heralds the creation of the entangled state |ΨL,R⟩. Limited by the coherence time between the levels
{|g⟩i , |s⟩i} [75], this entangled state is stored in the quantum memory provided by the L, R ensembles and available
‘on demand’ for subsequent tasks, such as entanglement connection [16, 76].
Although the preceding discussion is for an ideal case and neglects higher-order terms, the DLCZ protocol is designed
to be resilient to important sources of imperfections, including losses in propagation and detection, as well as detector
dark counts. Indeed, the scheme functions with “built-in entanglement puriﬁcation” [16] and enables entanglement
to be extended beyond the separation of two ensembles in an eﬃcient and scalable fashion. Theoretical extensions

Raman scattering [70], denoted as 1L, 1R. These ﬁelds interfere at a 50%-50% beam splitter, with outputs directed to single-
photon detectors D1, D2. A measurement event at either detector projects the L, R ensembles into the entangled state |ΨL,R⟩

Atomic excitations for the pairs Lu, Ll and Ru, Rl are subsequently converted to ﬂying photons at each node with polarization
encoding that leads to violation of a Bell inequality [93]. The entire experiment functions under the quantum control of single
detection events.
[77, 78, 79] of the DLCZ protocol have examined related network architectures for optimizing scalability in view of
actual laboratory capabilities, to which I next turn.
Coherence and entanglement with atomic ensembles
The publication of the DLCZ protocol in 2001 led to the rapid development of a worldwide community with by
now signiﬁcant achievements in the creation and distribution of entanglement. The initial, enabling steps in the
implementation of the protocol of DLCZ were the observations of quantum correlations both for single photon pairs

[81, 82] and for large photon number (103−104) [83] generated in the collective emission from atomic ensembles. Single
photons were generated by the eﬃcient mapping of stored, collective atomic excitation to propagating wavepackets
for ﬁeld 2, as in Box 3 [84, 85, 87, 88, 89]. Conditional readout eﬃciencies of 74% in free space [86] and 84% [90] in a
cavity were realized for the state transfer from a single, collective “spin” excitation stored in the atomic ensemble to
a single photon for ﬁeld 2.
With these capabilities for coherent control of collective atomic emission, heralded entanglement between distant
ensembles was achieved in 2005 [71], with the entangled state stored in quantum memories (i.e., the two ensembles)
located in distinct apparatuses separated by 3 m.
After a programmable delay, entanglement was conﬁrmed by
mapping the state of the atoms to optical ﬁelds and by measuring mutual coherence and photon statistics for these
ﬁelds. Although the degree of entanglement between the ensembles was small in the initial experiment [71], more
recent work [75] has led to the inference C = 0.9±0.3 for the concurrence C [91] of entanglement stored between L, R
ensembles, with the associated density matrix ρL,R shown in Fig. 3(b).
The DLCZ protocol is based upon a quantum repeater architecture involving independent operations on parallel
chains of quantum systems [16], with scalability relying critically upon conditional control of quantum states stored
in remote quantum memories [92]. The experiment shown in Fig. 3(c) [93] took an important step towards this goal
by achieving the minimal functionality required for scalable quantum networks. Heralded entanglement was created
asynchronously between a qubit located at node L and one at node R, where each qubit was encoded by a pair of
upper u and lower l atomic ensembles. The entangled states at the (L, R) nodes were stored in the quantum memory
provided by the ensembles, and then eﬃciently mapped to propagating light ﬁelds resulting in an eﬀective polarization
entangled state, as veriﬁed by the measured violation of a Bell inequality for these light ﬁelds. This setup was also
used for the initial investigation of entanglement swapping [76] to demonstrate coherence between ensembles that had
no direct interaction.
Beyond DLCZ’s proposal for measurement-induced entanglement, it is also possible to achieve deterministic mapping
of quantum states of light to and from atomic ensembles by way of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT)
[19, 20, 80]. The pioneering work in Refs. [94, 95] demonstrated the storage and retrieval of classical pulses to and
from an ensemble. Refs. [96, 97] extended this work into the quantum regime of single photons. Entanglement
between two ensembles coupled to a cavity mode was achieved in Ref. [98] by adiabatic transfer of excitation, thereby
providing a means for on-demand entanglement. To assist the distribution of entanglement over quantum networks,
Ref. [23] realized the reversible mapping of photonic entanglement into and out of pairs of quantum memories by an
EIT process illustrated in Fig. 1(d).
Contemporary with these experiments which achieved heralded [16, 71, 75, 93] and deterministic [23, 98] entangle-
ment have been a variety of experiments based upon entanglement as a post diction [99], for which a physical state
is not available for utilization in a scalable network but which are nonetheless signiﬁcant. An important advance in
this regard is the work in Ref. [100], which employed a pair of ensembles for entanglement generation to achieve a
posteriori teleportation of light to an atomic memory.
There has also been considerable eﬀort devoted to the detailed characterization of decoherence for stored atomic
excitation and entanglement [75, 93, 100].
Decoherence of entanglement between distinct atomic ensembles was
observed in the decay of the violation of a Bell inequality [93] and of the ﬁdelity for teleportation [100]. By way of
measurements of concurrence C(t), Ref. [75] presented quantitative characterizations for the relationship of the global
evolution of the entangled state to the temporal dynamics of various local correlations.
EXTENDING ENTANGLEMENT FOR QUANTUM NETWORKS
The entangled states created so far both in cavity QED and by way of the DLCZ protocol are between pairs of
systems, so-called bipartite entanglement, for which deﬁnitive procedures exist for operational veriﬁcation. Certainly
the creation of more general classes of entangled states shared among N > 2 systems would be of great interest. In
this regard, an important area of ongoing research is the development of theoretical protocols amenable to laboratory
implementation for entanglement veriﬁcation of quantum states distributed over the nodes of a quantum network.
However, as we progress toward more complex quantum networks, the issue of entanglement veriﬁcation becomes
increasingly problematic. Theoretical tools and experimental capabilities do not at present exist for characterizing
the general states of quantum networks.
Perhaps surprisingly, a nontrivial task will be simply to answer the question “Does it work?” That is, as even
moderately complex quantum networks are realized in the laboratory, it will become ever more diﬃcult to assess
quantitatively the characteristics of the network, including such basic questions as “Does entanglement extend across
the whole network?” On the one hand, we might follow a strategy motivated by the underlying physical processes

----- Page 9 (native) -----

upon which the network is based and attempt to determine, for example, the density matrix ρ(t) for the network.
This course of action surely fails because of the exponential growth in ρ(t) with the size of the network.
We might instead follow a strategy based upon more functional issues of algorithmic capability.
That is, we
could attempt to implement a quantum algorithm for computation or communication to test whether the purported
quantum network actually accomplishes anything beyond the capabilities of any classical counterpart. This course is
problematic since the advantage of a quantum network may only be realized above some threshold in the size of the
network. Furthermore, from an experimental perspective, this strategy does not oﬀer much in the way of diagnostics
for ‘ﬁxing’ the network when it fails.
A less obvious approach might be to adopt more seriously the perspective of a quantum network as a quantum
many body system and to search for more ‘physical’ characteristics of the network (e.g., the scaling behavior of pair
correlation functions and multipartite entanglement). Indeed, an active area of research is the nature of entanglement
for systems that undergo quantum phase transitions, including the pioneering advance for 1-D spin chains in Ref.
[101].
CONCLUSION
Although important progress has been made, there remain many scientiﬁc challenges that require new theoretical
insights and experimental capabilities in the quest to realize functional quantum networks. Certainly, the current state
of the art is primitive relative to that required for the robust and scalable implementation of sophisticated network
protocols, whether over short or long distances. The realization of quantum memories, local quantum processing,
quantum repeaters, and error-corrected teleportation are very ambitious goals. There is nevertheless considerable
activity worldwide directed towards these important goals.
While my discussion has considered separately cavity QED-based networks and those implemented via the DLCZ
protocol, clearly quantum networks will evolve as heterogeneous entities. For example, the same protocol that creates
the entangled state |ΨL,R⟩between two ensembles in Eq. 2 can be employed to create the entangled state
|ΠA,E⟩∼[|1A⟩|0E⟩± |0A⟩|1E⟩] ,
(3)
with one excitation shared jointly by an atom in a cavity |1A⟩and an atomic ensemble |1E⟩. A critical task is the
development of unambiguous procedures for entanglement veriﬁcation, which is a nontrivial undertaking that has not
always been carried out correctly [99].
I have used quantum networks as unifying theme but stress that the research described has much broader import,
including for advancing our understanding of quantum dynamical systems and, for the particular cases considered,
creating new physics from controlled nonlinear interactions of single photons and atoms. Altogether, these are exciting
times in Quantum Information Science as we pass from a regime of individual ‘Lego blocks’ (e.g., a single atom-cavity
system) into the realm of complex quantum systems assembled from many such units from the ground up. One
important area of this scientiﬁc enterprise is the realization of quantum networks.
I have every conﬁdence that
extending entanglement across quantum networks will create wonderful scientiﬁc opportunities for the exploration of
physical systems that have not heretofore existed in the natural world.

BOX 1 - MAPPING QUANTUM STATES BETWEEN ATOMS AND PHOTONS
Reversible state transfer between light and a single trapped atom can be achieved by way of the mappings |b⟩|1⟩→
|a⟩|0⟩and |a⟩|0⟩→|b⟩|1⟩for the coherent absorption and emission of single photons as illustrated in parts (i) and (ii)
of the ﬁgure [22]. Here |a⟩, |b⟩represent internal states of the atom with long-lived coherence (e.g., atomic hyperﬁne
states in the 6S1/2, F = 3 and F = 4 manifolds of atomic Cesium) and |0⟩, |1⟩are Fock states of the intracavity ﬁeld
with n = 0, 1 excitations. The transition |b⟩↔|e⟩is strongly coupled to a mode of an optical cavity with interaction
energy ℏg. In this simple setting, the interaction Hamiltonian for atom and cavity ﬁeld has a “dark state” (i.e., no
excited state component |e⟩) [49] given by [17]
|D⟩= cos θ |a⟩|0⟩+ sin θ |b⟩|1⟩,
(1)
where cos θ = [1 + Ω2(t)
g2 ]−1/2 with Ω(t) as a classical control ﬁeld. For Ω(t = 0) = 0, we have |D⟩= |a⟩|0⟩, while for
Ω(t →∞) ≫g, |D⟩→|b⟩|1⟩.
In (i), by adiabatically ramping a control ﬁeld Ω1(t) ≫g from on to oﬀover a time scale ∆t slow compared to
1/g, the atomic state is mapped from |b⟩to |a⟩with the accompanying coherent absorption of 1 intracavity photon.
Conversely, in (ii) by turning a control ﬁeld Ω2(t) from oﬀto on, the atomic state is mapped from |a⟩to |b⟩with the
transfer of 1 photon into the cavity mode.
As shown in (a)-(c) in the ﬁgure, these two processes can be combined to achieve the coherent transfer of the state
of a propagating optical ﬁeld λ(t) = |φfield(t)⟩into and out of a quantum memory formed by the atomic states |a⟩, |b⟩
[22]. In the ideal case, the mapping is speciﬁed by
|φfield(t)⟩|b⟩→(a) |0⟩(c1 |a⟩+ c0 |b⟩) · · ·(b) · · · →(c) |φfield(t + τ)⟩|b⟩.
(2)
where the ﬁeld state is taken to be a coherent superposition of zero and one photon, |φfield(t)⟩= E(t)[c0 |0⟩field +
c1 |1⟩field]. E(t) describes the envelope of the ﬁeld external to the cavity, with
R
|E(t)|2dt = 1. Given timing informa-
tion for incoming ﬁeld |φfield(t)⟩, step (a) in this process is accomplished by adiabatically ramping the control ﬁeld
Ω1(t) from on to oﬀ. In (b), the internal states of the atom provide a long-lived quantum memory. At a user-selected
later time t+τ, step (c) is initiated by turning Ω2(t+τ) from oﬀto on, thereby coherently mapping the atomic state
c1 |a⟩+ c0 |b⟩back to the “ﬂying” ﬁeld state β(t) = |φfield(t + τ)⟩.

BOX 2 - A NEW PARADIGM FOR CAVITY QED
The realization of large-scale quantum networks [4, 7] requires the capability to interconnect many quantum nodes
over quantum channels, for which conventional Fabry-Perot conﬁgurations are ill suited [57]. There have correspond-
ingly been eﬀorts to develop of alternative microcavity systems [31, 58], both for single atoms [43, 44, 59, 60] and
atom-like systems [61, 62], such as nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond [61]. A quantitative comparison of many
candidate systems is provided by Table I in Ref. [45].
A remarkable resonator for this purpose is the microtoroidal cavity formed from fused silica (SiO2) shown in the
ﬁgure [63, 64].
Such a resonator supports a whispering gallery mode (WGM) [65] circulating around the outer
circumference of the toroid with an evanescent ﬁeld external to the resonator, as shown in part (c) of the ﬁgure.
Because of the small mode volume Vm and large quality factor Q [65, 66], an atom interacting with the evanescent
ﬁeld of a WGM can be well into the regime of strong coupling with projected values for the critical photon n0 and
atom N0 numbers (n0, N0) ≃(2×10−5, 10−6) [45], respectively, signiﬁcantly beyond current [15] and projected [45, 57]
capabilities for cavity QED with Fabry-Perot cavities (Fig. 2(c)).
The fabrication techniques pioneered in Refs. [63, 64] lend themselves to the integration of many microtoroidal
resonators to form optical networks, as illustrated in (a) and (b) of the ﬁgure.
Part (a) shows a photograph of
silicon chip with a linear array of microtoroidal resonators within a UHV apparatus [44]. The toroids appear as small
scattering centers on a silicon chip that runs vertically down the center of the picture. The black arrows point to a
horizontal SiO2 ﬁber taper for coupling light to and from one resonator. Part (b) is a SEM micrograph of an array
of microtoroidal resonators showing toroids of fused silica on silicon supports [63].
These resonators have the capability for input-output coupling with small parasitic loss [64] for the conﬁguration
shown in (d), which is a photograph of an individual toroid and ﬁber coupler from (a) [44]. Quality factors Q = 4×108
have been realized at λ = 1550 nm and Q ≃108 at λ = 850 nm, with good prospects for improvement to Q ∼1010
[45]. For these parameters, the eﬃciency ϵ for coupling quantum ﬁelds into and out of the resonator could approach
ϵ ∼0.99 −0.999, while still remaining ﬁrmly in the regime of strong coupling [45]. Such high eﬃciency is critical for
the realization of complex quantum networks, including for the distribution and processing of quantum information
[4, 7, 47] and for investigations of the association between quantum many-body systems and quantum networks
[12, 14].
The initial step in this quest was the demonstration of strong coupling between individual atoms and the ﬁeld of
a microtoroidal resonator in Ref. [43]. More recently, nonclassical ﬁelds have been generated from the interaction
of single atoms with a microtoroidal resonator by way of a ‘photon turnstile’ for which a single atom dynamically
regulates the transport of photons one-by-one through the microtoroidal resonator [44], as illustrated in (d). Only
single photons can be transmitted in the forward direction (to the left in the ﬁgure), with excess photons n > 1
dynamically rerouted to the backward direction.

BOX 3 - WRITING AND READING SINGLE ATOMIC EXCITATIONS
The DLCZ protocol [16] is based upon ensembles of Na identical atoms with a Λ-level conﬁguration as shown in
the ﬁgure. The metastable lower states |g⟩and |s⟩can be, e.g., atomic hyperﬁne states of the electronic ground level
to ensure a long lifetime for coherence. As illustrated in (a), all atoms are initially prepared in state |g⟩with no
excitation, namely |0a⟩≡⊗Na
i
|g⟩i, and a weak oﬀ-resonant ‘write’ pulse is then sent through the ensemble. There
results a small amplitude √p for one of the Na atoms to be transferred from |g⟩to |s⟩and to emit a photon into
the forward-scattered optical mode (designated as ﬁeld 1) with frequency and/or polarization distinct from the write
ﬁeld.
Of course for small excitation probability p ≪1, mostly nothing happens as a result of the writing pulse, so that
the resulting state |φa,1⟩for the atomic ensemble and ﬁeld 1 in the ideal case is given by
|φa,1⟩= |0a⟩|01⟩+ eiβ√p |1a⟩|11⟩+ O(p),
(1)
where |n1⟩is the state of the forward-propagating ﬁeld 1 with n1 photons and the phase β is determined by the
write pulse and ﬁeld 1 propagation phases. The atomic state |1a⟩in Eq. 1 is a collective (entangled) state with one
excitation shared symmetrically among the Na atoms (i.e., one ‘spin ﬂip’), where in the ideal case [16]
|1a⟩=
1
√Na
Na
X
i=1
|g⟩1 · · · |s⟩i · · · |g⟩Na .
(2)
Field 1 is directed to a single-photon detector, where a detection event is recorded with probability ∝p. Such an
event for ﬁeld 1 heralds that a single excitation (or spin ﬂip |g⟩→|s⟩) has been created and stored in the atomic
ensemble in the state |1a⟩with high probability. Higher-order processes with multiple atomic and ﬁeld 1 excitations
are also possible and ideally occur to lowest order with probability p2.
After a user-deﬁned delay (subject to the ﬁnite lifetime of the quantum memory), the collective atomic excitation
|1a⟩can be eﬃciently converted to a propagating beam (designated as ﬁeld 2) by way of a strong ‘read’ pulse as in
(b), where in the ideal case, there is a one-to-one transformation of atomic to ﬁeld excitation, |1a⟩→|12⟩. For the
case of resonance with the |s⟩→|e⟩transition, the reading process utilizes the phenomenon of electromagnetically
induced transparency [19, 20, 80].
