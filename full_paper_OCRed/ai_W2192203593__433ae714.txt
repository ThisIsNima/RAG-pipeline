Taking the Human Out of the Loop:
A Review of Bayesian Optimization
Bobak Shahriari, Kevin Swersky, Ziyu Wang, Ryan P. Adams and Nando de Freitas
AbstractBig data applications are typically associated with
systems involving large numbers of users, massive complex
software systems, and large-scale heterogeneous computing and
storage architectures. The construction of such systems involves
many distributed design choices. The end products (e.g., rec-
ommendation systems, medical analysis tools, real-time game
engines, speech recognizers) thus involves many tunable cong-
uration parameters. These parameters are often specied and
hard-coded into the software by various developers or teams.
If optimized jointly, these parameters can result in signicant
improvements. Bayesian optimization is a powerful tool for
the joint optimization of design choices that is gaining great
popularity in recent years. It promises greater automation so as
to increase both product quality and human productivity. This
review paper introduces Bayesian optimization, highlights some
of its methodological aspects, and showcases a wide range of
applications.
I. INTRODUCTION
Design problems are pervasive in scientic and industrial
endeavours: scientists design experiments to gain insights into
physical and social phenomena, engineers design machines
to execute tasks more efciently, pharmaceutical researchers
design new drugs to ght disease, companies design websites
to enhance user experience and increase advertising revenue,
geologists design exploration strategies to harness natural re-
sources, environmentalists design sensor networks to monitor
ecological systems, and developers design software to drive
computers and electronic devices. All these design problems
are fraught with choices, choices that are often complex and
high-dimensional, with interactions that make them difcult
for individuals to reason about.
For example, many organizations routinely use the popular
