Abstract
Metabolic syndrome, variously known also as syndrome X, insulin resistance, etc., is defined by WHO as a pathologic condition
characterized by abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Though there is some variation in the
definition by other health care organization, the differences are minor. With the successful conquest of communicable infectious
diseases in most of the world, this new non-communicable disease (NCD) has become the major health hazard of modern world.
Though it started in the Western world, with the spread of the Western lifestyle across the globe, it has become now a truly global
problem. The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is often more in the urban population of some developing countries than in
its Western counterparts. The two basic forces spreading this malady are the increase in consumption of high calorie-low fiber fast
food and the decrease in physical activity due to mechanized transportations and sedentary form of leisure time activities. The
syndrome feeds into the spread of the diseases like type 2 diabetes, coronary diseases, stroke, and other disabilities. The total cost
of the malady including the cost of health care and loss of potential economic activity is in trillions. The present trend is not
sustainable unless a magic cure is found (unlikely) or concerted global/governmental/societal efforts are made to change the
lifestyle that is promoting it. There are certainly some elements in the causation of the metabolic syndrome that cannot be
changed but many are amenable for corrections and curtailments. For example, better urban planning to encourage active
lifestyle, subsidizing consumption of whole grains and possible taxing high calorie snacks, restricting media advertisement of
unhealthy food, etc. Revitalizing old fashion healthier lifestyle, promoting old-fashioned foods using healthy herbs rather than oil
and sugar, and educating people about choosing healthy/wholesome food over junks are among the steps that can be considered.

Introduction
With the successful conquest of many of the old infectious
diseases in the world, non-communicable diseases (NCD)
have become the major cause of morbidity and mortality not
only in the developed world but also in the underdeveloped
countries. Among all these NCD, metabolic syndrome had
been the real scourge globally.
Metabolic syndrome (MetS), also variously known as syn-
drome X, Insulin resistance, etc. in the literature, is really not a
single disease but a constellation of cardiovascular disease risk
factors and had been defined slightly differently by various
organizations. Three most popular definitions [1] used for
surveys and health care plan are:
WHO 1999:
Presence of insulin resistance or glucose > 6.1 mmol/L
(110 mg/dl), 2 h glucose > 7.8 mmol (140 mg/dl) (required)
along with any two or more of the following:
1.
HDL cholesterol < 0.9 mmol/L (35 mg/dl) in men,
< 1.0 mmol/L (40 mg/dl) in women
2.
Triglycerides > 1.7 mmol/L (150 mg/dl)
3.
Waist/hip ratio > 0.9 (men) or > 0.85 (women) or BMI >
30 kg/m2
4.
Blood pressure > 140/90 mmHg

NCEP (National Cholesterol Education Program) ATP3
2005:
Presence of any three or more of the following:
1.
Blood glucose greater than 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dl) or
drug treatment for elevated blood glucose
2.
HDL cholesterol < 1.0 mmol/L (40 mg/dl) in men,
< 1.3 mmol/L (50 mg/dl) in women or drug treatment
for low HDL-C
3.
Blood triglycerides > 1.7 mmol/L (150 mg/dl) or drug
treatment for elevated triglycerides
4.
Waist > 102 cm (men) or > 88 cm (women)
5.
Blood pressure > 130/85 mmHg or drug treatment for
hypertension
IDF (International Diabetes Federation) 2006:
Waist > 94 cm (men) or > 80 cm (women) along with the
presence of two or more of the following:
1.
Blood glucose greater than 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dl) or
diagnosed diabetes
2.
HDL cholesterol < 1.0 mmol/L (40 mg/dl) in men,
< 1.3 mmol/L (50 mg/dl) in women or drug treatment
for low HDL-C
3.
Blood triglycerides > 1.7 mmol/L (150 mg/dl) or drug
treatment for elevated triglycerides
4.
Blood pressure > 130/85 mmHg or drug treatment for
hypertension
Note: NCEP and IDF definition are very similar except in
the waist parameter of 102 vs. 94 cm in men and 88 vs.
80 cm in women.
Other organizations like the American Association of
Clinical Endocrinologist (AACE) 2003 and the European
Group for the Study of Insulin Resistance (EGIR) used slightly
different definitions but they are not as commonly used.
Incidence and Prevalence of Metabolic
Syndrome
The incidence of metabolic syndrome often parallels the inci-
dence of obesity and incidence of type 2 diabetes (one of the
outcome of MetS). According to NHNES data, during 1988–
2010, average BMI in USA increased by 0.37% per year in
both men and women and waist circumference (WC) in-
creased by 0.37 and 0.27% per year in women, respectively.
According to CDC data published in 2017, about 30.2 million
adults aged 18 years or older or 12.2% of USA adults had type
2 diabetes (T2DM). One quarter of these people (23.8%) were
not aware of having diabetes. Incidence of T2DM increased
with age, reaching a high of 25.2% among US seniors
(65 years or older). Prevalence of prediabetes or MetS was
about three times more. So, about one third of US adults have
metabolic syndrome [2].
Incidence of T2DM was even higher among certain ethnic
groups—15% among American Indians but lower among
Chinese Americans −4.3%. South Asian Americans had a
very high prevalence of metabolic syndrome along with
higher incidence of abdominal obesity [3].
In China, between 1992 and 2002, the prevalence of over-
weight and obesity increased from 14.6 to 21.8%—based on
WHO criterion. Using the Chinese obesity definition, with lower
BMI cutoff, the increase was from 20 to 29%. The incidence of
MetS increased from 8 to 10.6% in urban areas and 4.9 to 5.3% in
rural areas. Assuming the same rate of increase, the prevalence of
MetS in China in 2017 would be about 15.5% [4].
According to global survey of obesity in 195 countries, done in
2015, 604 million adults and 108 million children were obese.
Since 1980, prevalence of obesity doubled in 73 countries and
increased in most other countries. Of even greater concern was
that the rate of increase was even higher in childhood obesity [5].
According to this survey, obesity is no longer a disease of
affluence. The highest increase in prevalence of obesity in
young men (25–29 years) occurred in countries with low
socio-economic index (SDI). In the last three decades, the prev-
alence went from 1.1% in 1980 to 3.85 in 2015. Between 1990
and 2015, global rate of death related to high BMI increased by
28.3%. Obesity also contributed to 120 million disability-
adjusted life-years. The highest percentage change in age-
standardized BMI related deaths and disability-adjusted life-
years occurred in Bangladesh—one of the poorest country
and the country where the present author comes from. On the
other hand, age-standardized BMI-related morbidity and mor-
tality decreased by 37.2 and 43.7%, respectively, in Turkey.
Obesity, however, is not always synonymous with MetS.
There are so-called metabolically healthy obese (MHO) indi-
viduals who have high level of insulin sensitivity and do not
have hypertension and hyperlipidemia and other features of
MetS. Epidemiological survey suggests that MHO may ac-
count for a significant percentage of obese population [6].
According to CoLaus study—a single center cross-sectional
study including a random sample of 6188 extensively
phenotyped, Caucasian subjects aged 35–70 years living in
Lausanne, Switzerland—the prevalence of overweight, obesity,
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and microalbuminuria
was 36.6, 15.7, 36.7, 34.2, 6.6, and 6.3%, respectively, and in
this population (unlike in Middle east) in all categories, preva-
lence was higher in men than women. Prevalence increased
with age which is true for all other population study [7].
According to IDF diabetes atlas [8], global prevalence of
diabetes is 8.8% (415 m) as of 2015 and is expected to increase
12
Page 2 of 8
Curr Hypertens Rep (2018) 20: 12

----- Page 3 (native) -----
to 10.4% (642 m) by 2040. The highest prevalence of diabetes
was in North American and Caribbean region (11.5%). Over
half of all people with diabetes were living in Southeast Asia
and Western Pacific region. Prevalence is still relatively low in
Africa region. But in next 25 years, some of the highest growth
rate in diabetes is expected to be in sub-Saharan Africa and
Middle East/North Africa (141 and 104%, respectively).
We do not have similar global data on metabolic syn-
drome—which is harder to measure, but since MetS is about
three times more common than diabetes, the global prevalence
can be estimated to be about one quarter of the world popula-
tion. In other words, over a billion people in the world are
now affected with metabolic syndrome.
The prevalence estimates vary, based on the criteria used
for the definition of MetS. For example, a national survey in
Iran in 2007 showed prevalence of MetS was about 34.7%
based on ATP III criteria, 37.4% based on IDF definition,
and 41.6% based on ATP III/AHA/NHLBI criteria. In another
Middle Eastern country, Tunisia, prevalence was 45.5% based
on IDF criteria but 24.3% based on ATP III criteria. But in all
the Middle Eastern countries, prevalence was much higher
among women than men [9].
Biology of the Metabolic Syndrome
During the last three decades, while prevalence of MetS in-
creased, our understanding of the biology of the malady also
increased. All fats are no longer considered the same.
Adipocytes are now categorized as white adipocytes, brown
adipocytes, and beige adipocytes. The brown and beige adi-
pocytes are morphologically and functionally different than
white adipocytes. These cells have more mitochondria in the
cytoplasm enriched with more uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)
and able to produce more thermogenesis [10].
Rather than being an inert energy storage depot, adipocytes
are now known to be metabolically active, secreting over a doz-
en of hormones affecting the appetite, satiety, and energy metab-
olism of the body. While first known adipocyte hormone leptin
suppresses appetite and genetic absence of which causes massive
obesity, other hormones like adiponectin have just the opposite
effect [11]. Adiponectin increases insulin sensitivity, as well as
pancreatic beta cell survival and functionality. Overexpression of
adiponectin had profound positive effects on adipose tissue, e.g.,
increase in mitochondrial density, decrease in the size of adipo-
cytes, and transcriptional upregulations of factors related to effi-
cient esterification of free fatty acids. Recently, adiponectin was
found to be protective against the metabolic syndrome in a poly-
cystic ovary syndrome mouse model [12].
The macrophages residing in the fat tissue are a major
player in energy metabolism. Pro-inflammatory (M1) macro-
phages promote hepatic steatosis and adipogenesis, while
anti-inflammatory macrophages (M2) do the opposite.
Macrophage-restricted deficiency of transcriptional regulator
methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) also caused hepatic
steatosis and obesity phenotype in a mice model [13].
In a recent study, Chug et al. reported that M1 macrophage
retention in adipose tissue is mediated by alphabeta1 integrin.
The process is also dependent on expression of VCAM1 which
encodes vascular cell adhesion molecules—the counter recep-
tor for alpha-beta1 integrin. The retention and activation of M1
macrophages in fat tissue inhibit adipocyte UCP1 expression
and beige adipocytes. The role of alphabeta1 integrin in obesity
is particularly important since there is already an FDA-
approved drug Natalizumab, a monoclonal antibody that blocks
this integrin, used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis.
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is another important
factor in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome. In mice
experiment, Shan et al. showed that high fat diet (HFD)-in-
duced ER stress is dependent on inositol-requiring enzyme 1
alpha (IRE1alpha) activity. Deficiency of IRE1alpha
prevented obesity, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis in-
duced by HFD. IRE1alpha also suppresses the M2 macro-
phages in in adipose tissue [14].
One of the phenotypic features of MHO is their strong skel-
etal built. Underlying physiology of this is now better under-
stood. An osteoblast-derived hormone Lipocalin2 (LCN2)
maintains glucose homeostasis by inducing insulin secretion
and insulin sensitivity. LCN2 also inhibits food intake by sup-
pressing melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) in the paraventricular
and ventromedial neurons of the hypothalamus and activates
MC4R-dependent anorexigenic pathway [15].
Thyroid hormones along with beta-adrenergic hormones
are well-known factors regulating energy metabolism. Miao
et al. recently described the interaction of thyroid hormones
and liver x receptor (LXR) which serves as repressors of
UCP1 in classic brown adipocytes. Depletion of LXR in mice
activated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)-releasing hor-
mone (TRH)-positive neurons in the hypothalamus and stim-
ulated TSH from the pituitary gland leading to increased se-
cretion of thyroid hormone. Also, decreased expressions of
perinatal deiodinase 2 in hepatocytes greatly reduce the sus-
ceptibility to diet induced steatosis and obesity [16].
Gut microbiome has now become an important part of hu-
man biology in health and diseases. Healthy microbiome pre-
vents many cardiovascular diseases as well as MeTS/diabetes.
Everard et al. isolated one specific gut microbe Akkermansia
muciniphila, a mucin-degrading bacterium that resides in the
mucus layer of gut epithelium. Feeding mice with perbiotic
(oligofructose) normalized A. muciniphila abundance
(increased by 100-fold) and corrected the metabolic syndrome
in the obese mice. A. muciniphila administration increased the
intestinal level of endocannabinoids that control the inflamma-
tion, gut barrier, and gut peptide secretion. This group now
reported that use of membrane protein from A. muciniphila im-
proves metabolic syndrome in mice [17, 18].

In addition to these, other biologic mechanisms of MetS,
recently discovered, have potential therapeutic implication.
Kopec et al. showed that thrombin promotes diet-induced obe-
sity through fibrin-driven inflammation and that treatment
with thrombin inhibitor drug dabigatran—already in use for
treatment of DVT—limited HFD-induced obesity and MetS
[19]. Maternal vitamin D supplementation in mice reduced
MetS in the offspring [20]. Recently, Cox et al reported a
specially designed PPARdelta agonist which when used in
mice reduced the metabolic syndrome [21•].
In all epidemiologic studies, prevalence of MetS increases
with age. This is not surprising since there are many common-
alities in biochemical changes of aging process and metabolic
syndrome/diabetes [22].
Genetics and Epigenetics of Obesity/MetS
While there are some known genes associated with obesity
and MetS, the epidemic growth of the malady in a short period
makes genetic predisposition a minor component. A genome-
wide association study and Metabochip meta-analysis of BMI
done in 339,224 individuals identified 97 BMI-associated lo-
ci, 56 of which were novel. The 97 loci accounted for ~ 2.7%
of BMI variation and common variation accounted for > 20%
BMI variation [23].
However, epigenetics seems to have a bigger role in pro-
moting MetS. Parenteral obesity may cause obesity in the
offspring through epigenetic changes in the spermatozoa or
oocytes or more commonly in utero environment. Children
born to obese mother or father who underwent bariatric sur-
gery prior to conception of the children are less prone to
obesity/MetS than children born before bariatric surgery [24].
Epidemiological studies have shown strong association be-
tween intrauterine nutrition, patterns of postnatal nutrition,
and growth and metabolic syndrome in adults. Mothers ex-
posed to the Dutch famine of 1944/45 during the first two
trimesters of the pregnancy had babies with low birth weights
(LBW), but these babies had higher incidence of obesity in
adult life. LBW infants, who had rapid catch up growth as
infant, had the highest risk of developing obesity and MetS
in adult life. A similar phenomenon was observed in China
after the famine there in 1959–1961. Mechanistically, this
phenomenon seems to occur via decreased DNA methylation
of the imprinted IGF2 gene in the offspring and hypermethy-
lation of two obesity-related genes—leptin and TNF. In rodent
models of maternal under- or over-nutrition and newborn-
specific nutritional modifications, epigenetic changes were
seen that affected growth factors, adipogenesis, appetite con-
trol, and glucose homeostasis in the offspring [25].This phe-
nomenon is of particular concern and the high incidence of
obesity and MetS in the newly developing countries may be
explained by this mechanism.
Prevention
Exercise Physical activity (PA) and exercise are key compo-
nents of energy expenditure and energy balance. But the ben-
efit of exercise in preventing metabolic syndrome goes be-
yond the immediate benefit of caloric expenditure [26]. With
chronic exercise or increased PA, there are structural changes
in the muscles, increase in number of mitochondria in fiber,
secretion of metabolically beneficial hormone like Irisin with
reversal of muscle insulin resistance, and reduction in post-
prandial hepatic lipogenesis [27].
However, according to NHANES data during the period of
1988 and 2010, when the average BMI and WC increased in
US adults, the proportion of adults who reported NO leisure
lime physical activity (LTPA) increased from 19.1 to 51.7% in
women and from 11.4 to 43.5% in men. According to this
study, average caloric intake did not change during this time
and BMI and WC trends were associated with LTPA level and
not caloric intake [28].
According to recent CDC data, 40.8% of adults in USA
were physically inactive (defined as < 10 min a week moder-
ate or vigorous activity in each of the PA categories of work,
leisure time, and transportation). While we do not have easy
access to such physical activity data in the developing coun-
tries, it can be assumed that with the acceptance of Western
lifestyle, increased use of automobiles and more time spent
indoor watching TV or playing video games, the data trend
will be very similar. Increased sedentary lifestyle is a major
driving force for increased prevalence of MetS [29].
Diet Predimed and other studies provided evidence supporting
a beneficial role of traditional Mediterranean diet in preventing
diabetes and metabolic syndrome. In the Predimed study, it was
also observed that just an ounce of extra virgin olive oil
(EVOO) given as supplement to usual Western type diet re-
duced the incidence of MetS and hypertension [58].
Several dietary factors are known to prevent MetS. Notable
among these are olive oil, capsaicin, luteolin, curcumin,
cinnamon, rosemary, etc.
A systemic review on the effects of dietary polyphenols on
metabolic syndrome done recently showed that, at relatively
high doses, many polyphenols favorably influence different
features of metabolic syndrome. Soy isoflavone, citrus prod-
ucts, hesperidin, and quercetin improved lipid metabolism,
and cocoa supplement improved high blood pressure and
blood glucose. Green tea significantly reduced BMI and waist
circumference and improved lipid metabolism [30].
Epidemiologic data show that consumption of foods high
in capsaicin is associated with lower prevalence of obesity/
MetS. Capsaicin present in hot pepper works on the TRPV1
and PPAR alpha receptors and reduces metabolic dysregula-
tion in obese/diabetic mice by enhancing expression of
adiponectin and its receptor [31, 32].

Cheng et al. recently reported that low-calorie, low-protein,
and low-carb but high fat fasting mimicking ketogenic diet for
4 days increased the generation of pancreatic beta cells and
reversed both T1D and T2D phenotypes in mouse models
[33•].
(In mice, a 4-day fasting mimicking diet (FMD) induces a
stepwise expression of Sox17 and Pdx-1, followed by Ngn3-
driven generation of insulin-producing β cells, resembling
that observed during pancreatic development.) FMD cycles
restore insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis in both type
2 and type 1 diabetes mouse models. In human type 1 diabetes
pancreatic islets, fasting conditions reduce PKA and mTOR
activity and induce Sox2 and Ngn3 (Neurogenin 3) expression
and insulin production.
Liu et al. recently reported in Nature that blocking follicle-
stimulating hormone (FSH) induces thermogenic adipose tis-
sue and reduces body fat [34]. A non-classic eicosanoid
Lipoxin A4 also has been shown to attenuate obesity-
induced adipose inflammation and associated liver and kidney
disease [35].
Of the traditional approved drug, the most effective medi-
cine in preventing MetS is metformin which is a unique anti-
diabetic medicine whose mechanism of action is not fully
understood yet but closely mimics the effect of exercise [36,
37•, 38]. There are many functional foods—mostly herbs that
are effective in preventing metabolic syndrome to some
extent.
Carnosic acid is a major bioactive component in Rosemary
extract and it is found to ameliorate HFD-induced obesity and
metabolic syndrome in mice [39]. Recently, Indian investiga-
tors showed that a single supplement intervention of 3 g cin-
namon for 16 weeks resulted in significant improvements in
all components of metabolic syndrome in a North Indian co-
hort [40]. Another herbal product that has shown promise in
combating MetS is Ashwagandha [41, 42].
Galantamine is a centrally active acetyl cholinesterase
inhibitor with anti-inflammatory properties and is FDA-
approved for treatment of dementia. According to a recent
RCT done in Brazil, daily intake of 8–16 mg of galantamine
orally for 4 weeks reduced plasma levels of TNF and leptin
and increased level of adiponectin and IL-10 and signifi-
cantly lowered plasma insulin and insulin HOMA-IR [43].
If these results are confirmed, galantamine may be a useful
drug for alleviation of metabolic syndrome. Another herbal
product Celastrol has shown promise in combating obesity
and MetS in mice model [44]. Kefir—a dairy-based drink
popular in some culture—is now showing up in Western
supermarket because of its effect in preventing metabolic
syndrome [45].
But knowledge of special diet and use of different herbs/
functional foods can only go so far. To really stop and control
the epidemic of MetS, a societal/governmental/global ap-
proach is urgently needed.
Civil societies, outside of the strict medical community,
need to help disseminate the awareness of the huge impact
of MetS on the overall health in the global community. Civil
society can help disseminate the awareness and relevant issues
to the common citizenry through discussion, debates/lectures,
and effective use of mass media. Rather than viewing the
obesity and leanness as an anthropometric and fashion issue,
attention should be directed to the associated health issue with
acknowledgement that all obese persons are not metabolically
unfit and all lean people are not metabolically fit [46•].
Producers of literatures on health should try to popularize
the waist/hip ratio concept as better matrix of metabolic syn-
drome than BMI [47]. Building a culture of physical fitness
and healthy diet from cradle to the grave should be the societal
goal [48•].
Newer technology can be used to educate and create aware-
ness. Use of Facebook and electronic apps may be used in
promoting healthy lifestyle. Newer technology is also needed
in creating better food quality supply. We know that eating
whole grain product is less likely to cause MetS than refined
carbohydrate [49]. A simple improvement in machines used in
milling the rice so that the husk with fibers are not totally
removed as in “white” rice, or “white” flour, can make a big
difference in the quality of the primary carbohydrate con-
sumed by millions.
Governmental involvements at municipal levels to
country level are very important. Sometime, a minor
change in law can accomplish much more than many lec-
tures and good advice. The small tax imposed on sugary
drinks in New York City, Philadelphia, or at the country
level like in Mexico was effective in lowering consumption
of sugary drinks [50]. But laws need to be carefully crafted
and be a part of total societal resolve to counter the prob-
lem obesity/MetS. Otherwise, it can be a dismal failure.
One example is mandatory labeling of fat content in some
food items in the USA. The result was many food items
with low or no fat but higher sugar content without change
in total calorie content. Also, scapegoating fructose as
causing metabolic syndrome without giving similar restric-
tion on overall sugar/calorie consumption did not prevent
the spread of obesity in the USA [51•].
Government can help create life-long health impact by en-
suring good minimal perinatal care and promotion of breast
feeding for every newborn. It can also introduce good cooking
lesson and basic nutritional knowledge in secondary schools.
Generations of young people are now entering adulthood
without knowing how to cook and thereby depending on fast
foods for survival. If these young men and women discover
the joy of cooking, promoting healthy diet among them will be
easier.
Governments can also ensure creation of more parks and
pedestrian walkways during urban development plan. One
Latin American city once banned its citizens from using any

automobile one Sunday a month. The result was astonishing.
Suddenly, there were swarms of kids and adults in the street
playing football or other games and no one was driving. It was
magical.
And lastly, governments can lead in educating the health
care provider about the enormous economic cost of the MetS
epidemic and mandate some incentive for preventive care. But
medical doctors are not well suited for preventive care and
cadres of barefoot doctors may need to be used for this pur-
pose. Since in many countries vaccination programs are used
by such providers, they can be retrained now for the preven-
tion of this new epidemic.
WHO or similar organizations can work with country level
governments to make country-specific plan to confront the
epidemic, keeping in mind the cultural, economic, and educa-
tional matrix of individual country [52•]. While it is a global
epidemic, there is wide variation in the prevalence within sim-
ilar socio-economic strata of countries. WHO can study what
is right with the countries which are successful in controlling
MetS and what is wrong elsewhere [53, 54].
And lastly, health care providers need to take leadership
position in directing the society towards a healthy community
that are not only free of infectious disease but are physically fit
and enjoying disease-free long life. Most practicing clinicians
do not talk to the patients about good eating habits and need
for adequate physical activity. But few words of such re-
minders and encouragements during routine visit can go a
long way in changing people’s habit.
Lastly, many of the MetS are iatrogenic due to wide use of
some drugs especially the new generation of anti-depression
and anti-psychotic meds [55•]. Many HIV drugs are also
obesogenic. Patients may need to be particularly warned about
these side effects and taught some preventive measure early
on. Preventive use of metformin and similar drugs may be
useful in such patients and others who are at high risk for
developing MetS.
Conclusion
The metabolic syndrome is a complex pathophysiologic state
that originates primarily from an imbalance of calorie intake
and energy expenditure but also affected by genetic/epigenetic
make up of individual, predominance of sedentary lifestyle over
physical activity, and other factors like quality and composition
of food and composition of gut microbes. No single remedy can
be prescribed for its eradication or even curtailment.
The epidemic did not happen suddenly and it cannot be con-
trolled quickly, but if there is a societal will, it can be done. As in
the control of other epidemics, education of the population about
the health hazard of the metabolic syndrome will be very impor-
tant. Since metabolic syndrome is a complex medical diagnosis
requiring blood tests, simple anthropometric definition that can
be easily used and accepted by populace is necessary. While
exact measure to be taken can be debated, promoting the danger
of increase in abdominal girth or waist/hip ratio can be a starting
point. A slogan like, if your belt size increases by a notch, danger
is lurking inside the belly can be promoted. Or “sweets are for
weak-lings, hot peppers are for the machos.”
Targeting the younger population to prevent MetS before it
happens is a better plan than trying to cure it after it happens.
While a dedicated group of public health planner can create a
comprehensive plan for a given society or a given community,
here are some suggestions:
1.
Cooking skills should be taught to the students in high
school/college. Without learning to cook healthy yet en-
joyable food, the dependency on fast food cannot be con-
trolled. Many commercial ventures in the USA that are
helping young couples to cook are a good start but they
are expensive and not widely adoptable.
2.
Governments need to stop subsidizing unhealthy food
(farm support bill in the USA).
3.
Before embarking on any large-scale change, planners need
to do pilot studies to see what works and what does not.
4.
Increase investment in finding pharmaceutical assistance
by developing drugs like metformin.
5.
Understand the biology even better. Recently, three pub-
lications in Nature medicine reported the biological im-
portance of GDF15 and its receptor in maintaining energy
balance [56, 57•]. These and other recent understanding of
energy metabolism need to be translated in practical ap-
plication in humans.
6.
The present epidemic of MetS is also related to the wide
acceptance of predominantly Western capitalistic eco-
nomic development model. A better, more humane eco-
nomic development plan can address the inherent health
hazards of this capitalistic model where profits supercede
long-term effects on the society. Better understanding of
socio-economic plans that promote conditions favoring
the MetS epidemic can help choose alternate development
plan.

tors are successfully being used in treatment of hyperlipidemia
and type 2 diabetes, their use and benefits are limited. The third
PPAR receptor PPAR delta is widely expressed in different tis-
sues and activation in animal models improved lipid homeosta-
sis and insulin sensitivity. Wu et al recently developed a highly
selective set of chemicals that target PPAR delta paving the way
of human use of a PPAR delta agonist to combat metabolic
syndrome.

protein kinase (AMPK) is a central pathogenetic factor for in-
sulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. Increasing AMPK
either by caloric restriction, exercise or through use of activator
drugs like metformin, thiazolidinediones, adipocyte derived
hormone adiponectine, GLP1 agonists all improves the insulin
resistance/metabolic syndrome.

called metabolically healthy obese (MHO) are characterized by
high levels of insulin sensitivity, absence of hypertension and
hyperlipidemia and other features of MS. Epidemiological
evidence suggests that MHO may account for as much as 3/5
of the obese population.

created a false sense of security in consuming sweetened food
not using HFCS. The assumption was refuted late but it took a
