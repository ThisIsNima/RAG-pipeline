Reproducible, interactive, scalable and extensible microbiome 
data science using QIIME 2
A full list of authors and affiliations appears at the end of the article.
To the Editor — Rapid advances in DNA-sequencing and bioinformatics technologies in the 
past two decades have substantially improved understanding of the microbial world. This 
growing understanding relates to the vast diversity of microorganisms; how microbiota and 
microbiomes affect disease1 and medical treatment2; how microorganisms affect the health 
of the planet3; and the nascent exploration of the medical4, forensic5, environmental6 and 
agricultural7 applications of microbiome biotechnology. Much of this work has been driven 
by marker-gene surveys (for example, bacterial/archaeal 16S rRNA genes, fungal internal-
transcribed-spacer regions and eukaryotic 18S rRNA genes), which profile microbiota with 
varying degrees of taxonomic specificity and phylogenetic information. The field is now 
transitioning to integrate other data types, such as metabolite8, metaproteome9 or 
metatranscriptome9,10 profiles.
The QIIME 1 microbiome bioinformatics platform has supported many microbiome studies 
and gained a broad user and developer community. Interactions with QIIME 1 users in our 
online support forum, our workshops and direct collaborations have shown the platform’s 
potential to serve an increasingly diverse array of microbiome researchers in academia, 
government and industry. Here, we present QIIME 2, a completely reengineered and 
rewritten system that is expected to facilitate reproducible and modular analysis of 
microbiome data to enable the next generation of microbiome science.
QIIME 2 was developed on the basis of a plugin architecture (Supplementary Fig. 1) that 
allows third parties to contribute functionality (https://library.qiime2.org). QIIME 2 plugins 
exist for latest-generation tools for sequence quality control from different sequencing 
platforms (DADA2 (ref.11) and Deblur12), taxonomy assignment13 and phylogenetic 
insertion14, which quantitatively improve the results over QIIME 1 and other tools (as 
detailed in the corresponding tool-specific publications). The plugins also support

qualitatively new functionality, including microbiome paired-sample and time-series 
analysis15 (which are critical for studying the effects of treatments on the microbiome), and 
machine learning16. Trained machine learning models can be saved for application to new 
data and interrogated to identify important microbiome features. Several recently released 
plugins, including q2-cscs17, q2-metabolomics18, q2-shogun19, q2-metaphlan2 (ref.20) and 
q2-picrust2 (ref.21), provide initial support for analysis of metabolomics and shotgun 
metagenomics data. We are currently working with teams developing bioinformatics tools 
for metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics, and we expect to add new plugins supporting 
these data types to the ecosystem shortly. Additionally, many of the existing ‘downstream’ 
analysis tools, such as q2-sample-classifier16, can already work with these data types 
individually or in combination if they are provided in a feature table. Thus, QIIME 2 has the 
potential to serve not only as a marker-gene analysis tool but also a multidimensional and 
powerful data science platform that can be rapidly adapted to analyze diverse microbiome 
features.
QIIME 2 provides many new interactive visualization tools facilitating exploratory analyses 
and result reporting. Static versions of interactive visualizations resulting from four worked 
examples are provided in Fig. 1. QIIME 2 View (https://view.qiime2.org) is a unique new 
service (Supplementary Methods) that allows users to securely share and interact with 
results without installing QIIME 2. The QIIME 2 visualizations presented in Fig. 1 are 
provided in Supplementary File 1 to allow readers to interact with QIIME 2 View. 
Corresponding worked QIIME 2 example code is provided in the Supplementary Methods.
Reproducibility, transparency and clarity of microbiome data science are guiding principles 
in QIIME 2 design. To this end, QIIME 2 includes a decentralized data-provenance tracking 
system: details of all analysis steps with references to intermediate data are automatically 
stored in the results. Users can thus retrospectively determine exactly how any result was 
generated (Fig. 2 illustrates a simplified provenance graph derived from the data provenance 
of Fig. 1b). QIIME 2 also detects corrupted results indicating that the provenance is no 
longer reliable and the results no longer contain information enabling reproducibility. The 
provenance of the visualizations presented in Fig. 1 can be interactively reviewed by loading 
the contents of Supplementary File 1 with QIIME 2 View, providing far more detailed 
information than can typically be provided in Methods text. QIIME 2 results are also 
semantically typed (Fig. 2), and actions indicate acceptable input types, clarifying the data 
that actions should be applied to and making complex workflows less error prone. Complex 
workflows can be created and shared by using Jupyter Notebooks22 or Common Workflow 
Language (CWL)23, and support for other workflow engines is currently in development.
Finally, QIIME 2 provides a software-development kit (https://dev.qiime2.org) that can be 
used to integrate it as a component of other systems (such as Qiita24 or Illumina BaseSpace) 
and to develop interfaces targeted toward users with different levels of computational 
sophistication (Supplementary Fig. 2). QIIME 2 provides the QIIME 2 Studio graphical user 
interface and QIIME 2 View, interfaces designed for end-user biologists, clinicians and 
policy-makers; the QIIME 2 application programming interface, designed for data scientists 
who want to automate workflows or work interactively in Jupyter Notebooks22; and q2cli 
and q2cwl, providing a command-line interface and CWL23 wrappers for QIIME 2,

designed for experts in high-performance computing. At present, computationally expensive 
steps support parallel computing at the individual-action level (for example, many actions 
including de-noising and taxonomy assignment support multiple threads). We are currently 
developing deeper integration with parallelism strategies available in third-party workflow 
engines, and workflow-level parallelism is currently possible through CWL.
There are many other powerful open-source software tools for microbiome data science, 
including mothur25, phyloseq26 and related tools available through Bioconductor27, and the 
biobakery suite20,21,28. The microbiome bioinformatics platform mothur is often compared 
to QIIME 1 and QIIME 2. A major difference between mothur and QIIME lies in the 
interactive visualizations: QIIME 2 provides many interactive visualization tools (several 
examples are provided in Fig. 1), whereas mothur focuses on generating data that can be 
easily loaded and visualized with other tools. The phyloseq tool focuses on microbiome 
statistical analysis and generating publication-ready visualizations but, unlike QIIME 2, 
begins with a feature or operational-taxonomic-unit table, leaving ‘upstream’ processing 
steps, such as sequence demultiplexing and quality control, to other processing pipelines, 
many of which (like phyloseq) are available through Bioconductor. The biobakery suite 
provides analytic functionality that complements that of QIIME 2, and we are actively 
working with biobakery developers to support interoperability by making their tools 
accessible as QIIME 2 plugins (for example, the q2-metaphlan2 plugin allows users to run 
MetaPhlAn2 through QIIME 2). QIIME 2 provides the only Python-based microbiome data-
science platform that supports retrospective data-provenance tracking to ensure 
reproducibility, multi-omics analysis support, interfaces geared toward different user types to 
enhance usability and an extensibility-focused design through the plugin architecture and 
software-development kit. We share feedback from users of QIIME 2 on these and other 
features in Supplementary Methods.
The tools described in the preceding paragraph are all interoperable through plugins, 
exchange of files in standard formats or using multi-language environments, such as Jupyter 
Notebooks22. For example, the BIOM format29 is supported by all of them. A diverse 
ecosystem of interoperable software is beneficial for the field, because it allows both 
experienced users to obtain multiple perspectives on their data and novice bioinformaticians 
to work in the programming environments that they are most comfortable with (for example, 
phyloseq allows users to work in R, whereas QIIME 2 allows users to work in Python). We 
plan to continue working with the developers of these tools, and with organizations such as 
the Genomics Standards Consortium, on plugins and standards to ensure interoperability, as 
well as developing tools to automatically import data from microbiome data-sharing 
platforms such as Qiita, the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) European Read Archive 
and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive.
Advances in microbiome research promise to improve many aspects of health and the world, 
and QIIME 2 will help drive those advances by enabling accessible, community-driven 
microbiome data science.

Fig. 1 |. QIIME 2 provides many interactive visualization tools.
The products of four worked examples are presented here, and interactive versions of these 
screen captures are available in Supplementary File 1 and at https://github.com/qiime2/
paper1. Detailed descriptions and methods, including the commands used to generate each 
of these visualizations, are provided in Supplementary Methods. a, Unweighted UniFrac 
principal coordinate analysis plot containing 37,680 samples, illustrating the scalability of 
QIIME 2. Colors indicate sample type, as described by the Earth Microbiome Project 
ontology (EMPO). b, Interactive taxonomic composition bar plot illustrating the phylum-
level composition of microbial-mat samples collected along a temperature gradient in 
Yellowstone National Park Hot Spring outflow channels (Steep Cone Geyser). The many 
interactive controls available in this plot vastly decrease the burden of exploratory analysis 
over QIIME 1. c, Feature volatility plot (https://msystems.asm.org/content/3/6/e00219-18) 
illustrating the change in Bifidobacterium abundance over time in breast-fed and formula-
fed infants. Temporally interesting features can be interactively discovered with this 
visualization. Bar charts rank the importance (predictive power for time point) and mean 
abundance of all microbial features. These bar charts provide an interface for visualizing 
volatility plots (line plots) of individual features in the context of their importance and 
abundance; clicking on a bar will display the volatility plot of that feature and highlight in 
blue that feature’s importance and abundance in the bar charts below. d, Molecular 
cartography of the human skin surface. Colored spots represent the abundance of the small-
molecule cosmetic ingredient sodium laureth sulfate on the human skin. Sample data can be 
interactively visualized in three-dimensional models, thus supporting the discovery of spatial 
patterns.

Fig. 2 |. QIIME 2 iteratively records data provenance, ensuring bioinformatics reproducibility.
This simplified diagram illustrates the automatically tracked information regarding the 
creation of the taxonomy bar plot presented in Fig. 1b. QIIME 2 results (circles) contain 
network diagrams illustrating the data provenance stored in the result. Actions 
(quadrilaterals) are applied to QIIME 2 results and generate new results. Arrows indicate the 
flow of QIIME 2 results through actions. TaxonomicClassifier and FeatureData[Sequence] 
inputs contain independent provenance (red and blue, respectively) and are provided to a 
classify action (yellow), which taxonomically annotates sequences. The result of the classify 
action, a FeatureData[Taxonomy] result, integrates the provenance of both inputs with the 
classify action. This result is then provided to the barplot action with a 
FeatureTable[Frequency] input, which shares some provenance with the 
FeatureData[Sequence] input, because they were generated from the same upstream 
analysis. The resulting visualization (Fig. 1b) has the complete data provenance and 
correctly identifies shared processing of inputs. This simplified representation was created 
manually from the complete provenance graph for the purpose of illustration. An interactive 
and complete version of this provenance graph (as well as those for other Fig. 1 panels) can 
be accessed through Supplementary File 1.
