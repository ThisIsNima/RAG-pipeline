The first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
likely occurred from a zoonotic transmission in China 
in December 2019, linked to a large seafood market 
that also traded in live wild animals. The causative 
virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-​CoV-2) is capable of human-​to-​human trans-
mission and spread rapidly to other parts of China and 
then to other locations. By 24 March 2020, SARS-​CoV-2 
had infected more than 381,000 people across 195 coun-
tries/regions and killed more than 16,000: a pandemic 
as declared by the World Health Organization1. Daily 
reports of sharp rises in the number of new cases con-
tinue to emerge from many countries/regions, but efforts 
to overcome the virus are hampered by a lack of knowl-
edge of several important aspects of SARS-​CoV-2 infec-
tion, ranging from pathogen biology to host response 
and treatment options. Therefore, there is an urgent 
need to better understand the host–pathogen biology 
of COVID-19 as this will offer important insights into 
treatment and management of the disease, including 
identification of new therapies. Here, we review the 
literature on SARS-​CoV-2 pathophysiology, its inter-
action with target cells and the immune response to 
the virus, including the contribution of dysfunctional 
immune responses to disease progression. Specifically, 
we highlight the implications of specific features of the 
infection for promising therapeutic interventions that 
could target the virus or the dysfunctional immune 
response. Moreover, we discuss how studies focused 
on the adaptive immune response will be crucial in 
informing the development of vaccines and therapeutic 
monoclonal antibodies.
Pathogenesis of COVID-19
Coronaviruses are known to cause disease in humans 
and animals. Among these, four (human corona­
viruses 229E, NL63, OC43 and HKU1) typically infect 
only the upper respiratory tract and cause relatively 
minor symptoms2. However, there are three corona-
viruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome corona­
virus (SARS-​CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus (MERS-​CoV) and SARS-​CoV-2) that can 
replicate in the lower respiratory tract and cause pneu-
monia, which can be fatal. SARS-​CoV-2 belongs to the 
betacoronavirus genus. Its closest relative among human 
coronaviruses is SARS-​CoV, with 79% genetic similar-
ity3. However, among all known coronavirus sequences, 
SARS-​CoV-2 is most similar to bat coronavirus RaTG13, 
with 98% similarity4, and coronavirus sequences in the 
pangolin (a scaly anteater) also share high similarity5.
Like the other respiratory coronaviruses, SARS-​CoV-2 
is transmitted primarily via respiratory droplets, with a 
possible, but unproven, faecal–oral transmission route. 
On infection, the median incubation period is approx-
imately 4–5 days before symptom onset6–9, with 97.5% 
of symptomatic patients developing symptoms within 
11.5 days8. At the point of hospital admission, patients 
with COVID-19 typically exhibit a fever and dry cough;

Abstract | Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-​CoV-2) is the causative agent 
of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Alongside investigations into  
the virology of SARS-​CoV-2, understanding the fundamental physiological and immunological 
processes underlying the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 is vital for the identification and 
rational design of effective therapies. Here, we provide an overview of the pathophysiology of 
SARS-​CoV-2 infection. We describe the interaction of SARS-​CoV-2 with the immune system  
and the subsequent contribution of dysfunctional immune responses to disease progression. 
From nascent reports describing SARS-​CoV-2, we make inferences on the basis of the parallel 
pathophysiological and immunological features of the other human coronaviruses targeting the 
lower respiratory tract — severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-​CoV) and Middle 
East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-​CoV). Finally , we highlight the implications of 
these approaches for potential therapeutic interventions that target viral infection and/or 
immunoregulation.

less commonly, patients also experience difficulty in 
breathing, muscle and/or joint pain, headache/dizziness, 
diarrhoea, nausea and the coughing up of blood6,10–15. 
Within 5–6 days of symptom onset, SARS-​CoV-2 viral 
load reaches its peak — significantly earlier than that of 
the related SARS-​CoV, where viral load peaks at about 
10 days after symptom onset16–19. Severe COVID-19 
cases progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome 
(ARDS), on average around 8–9 days after symptom

The pathophysiology of SARS-​CoV-2 infection 
closely resembles that of SARS-​CoV infection, with 
aggressive inflammatory responses strongly implicated 
in the resulting damage to the airways21. Therefore, dis-
ease severity in patients is due to not only the viral infec-
tion but also the host response. The pattern of increasing 
severity with age is also broadly consistent with the 
epidemiology of SARS-​CoV and MERS-​CoV6,11,14.
ARDS seen in severe COVID-19 is characterized 
by difficulty in breathing and low blood oxygen level22. 
As a result, some patients may succumb to secondary 
bacterial and fungal infections14. ARDS may lead directly 
to respiratory failure, which is the cause of death in 
70% of fatal COVID-19 cases22. In addition, the vast 
release of cytokines by the immune system in response 
to the viral infection and/or secondary infections can 
result in a cytokine storm and symptoms of sepsis that 
are the cause of death in 28% of fatal COVID-19 cases22. 
In these cases, uncontrolled inflammation inflicts 
multi-​organ damage leading to organ failure, especially 
of the cardiac, hepatic and renal systems (Fig. 1). Most 
patients with SARS-​CoV infection who progressed to 
renal failure eventually died23.
Host cell infection and its prevention
The first step in infection is virus binding to a host cell 
through its target receptor. Earlier work on SARS-​CoV 
demonstrated that this virus principally targets airway 
epithelial cells, alveolar epithelial cells, vascular endo­
thelial cells and macrophages in the lung, all of which 
express the angiotensin-​converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 
host target receptor used by SARS-​CoV24–26 (Fig. 2). 
As SARS-​CoV-2 uses the same entry receptor, these cell 
subsets are likely targeted by this virus4,27,28. SARS-​CoV 
infection reduces ACE2 expression in lung cells. Because 
loss of pulmonary ACE2 function is associated with acute 
lung injury, virus-​induced ACE2 downregulation may 
be important for disease pathology29–32. ACE2 has been 
shown to regulate the renin–angiotensin system (RAS)32. 
Therefore, a reduction in ACE2 function after viral 
infection could result in a dysfunction of the RAS, which 
influences blood pressure and fluid/electrolyte balance, 
and enhance inflammation and vascular permeability in 
the airways.
COVID-19 shows a difference in fatality rate between 
males (2.8%) and females (1.7%)33. As ACE2 is located 
on the X chromosome, there may be alleles that confer 
resistance to COVID-19, explaining the lower fatality 
rate in females. Alternatively, the oestrogen and testos-
terone sex hormones have different immunoregulatory 
functions, which could influence immune protection or 
disease severity34.
SARS-​CoV-2 shares 79% genome sequence identity 
with SARS-​CoV4. The spike (S) protein is expressed 
on the surface of the virus particles, giving the char-
acteristic ‘crown’ appearance. The S protein comprises 
two subunits: S1 and S2. The S1 subunit consists of an 
amino-​terminal domain and a receptor-​binding domain 
(RBD), which in SARS-​CoV spans from amino acid res-
idue 318 to amino acid residue 510 (refs35–37). The RBD 
binds to ACE2 as its host cell target receptor, which starts 
the infection process4. RBD binding to ACE2 triggers 
endocytosis of the SARS-​CoV-2 virion and exposes it 
to endosomal proteases38. The S2 subunit consists of 
a fusion peptide (FP) region and two heptad repeat 
regions: HR1 and HR2 (refs39,40). Within the endosome, 
the S1 subunit is cleaved away, exposing the fusion 
peptide, which inserts into the host membrane. The 
S2 region then folds in on itself to bring the HR1 and 
HR2 regions together. This leads to membrane fusion 
and releases the viral package into the host cytoplasm.
There is 72% similarity in the amino acid sequence 
of the RBDs of SARS-​CoV and SARS-​CoV-2, with 
highly similar tertiary structures. Computational mod-
elling and biophysical measurements indicate that the 
SARS-​CoV-2 RBD binds to ACE2 with higher affinity 
than that of SARS-​CoV41,42. In addition, the SARS-​CoV-2 
S protein contains a furin-​like cleavage site, similarly to 
MERS-​CoV and human coronavirus OC43, which is 
not found in SARS-​CoV43. These characteristics could 
contribute to the increased infectivity of SARS-​CoV-2 
relative to SARS-​CoV. In addition to furin precleavage, 
the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 is also required 
to properly process the SARS-​CoV-2 spike protein and 
facilitate host cell entry44.
One pathway for the development of therapeutics 
against SARS-​CoV-2 is to block the host target ACE2 
receptor or TMPRSS2 (Fig. 3). Currently, there are 
compounds that target these molecules that have been 
clinically approved for other indications. For example, 
machine learning algorithms predicted that baricitinib, 
a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor approved for treatment 
of rheumatoid arthritis, could inhibit ACE2-​mediated 
endocytosis45. Another JAK inhibitor, ruxolitinib, will 
be tested in clinical trials for treatment of COVID-19 
later this year46. An alternative strategy is to deliver high 
concentrations of a soluble form of ACE2 that could 
potentially reduce virus entry into target host cells. This 
principle is being tested with APN01, a recombinant 
form of ACE2 developed by APEIRON that is currently 
in clinical trials47. Monoclonal antibodies targeting the 
Fig. 1 | Chronology of events during SARS-CoV-2 infection. When severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-​CoV-2) infects cells expressing the surface 
receptors angiotensin-​converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and TMPRSS2, the active replication 
and release of the virus cause the host cell to undergo pyroptosis and release damage-​
associated molecular patterns, including ATP, nucleic acids and ASC oligomers.  
These are recognized by neighbouring epithelial cells, endothelial cells and alveolar 
macrophages, triggering the generation of pro-​inflammatory cytokines and chemokines 
(including IL-6, IP-10, macrophage inflammatory protein 1α (MIP1α), MIP1β and MCP1). 
These proteins attract monocytes, macrophages and T cells to the site of infection, 
promoting further inflammation (with the addition of IFNγ produced by T cells) and 
establishing a pro-​inflammatory feedback loop. In a defective immune response  
(left side) this may lead to further accumulation of immune cells in the lungs, causing 
overproduction of pro-​inflammatory cytokines, which eventually damages the lung 
infrastructure. The resulting cytokine storm circulates to other organs, leading to  
multi-​organ damage. In addition, non-​neutralizing antibodies produced by B cells may 
enhance SARS-​CoV-2 infection through antibody-​dependent enhancement (ADE), 
further exacerbating organ damage. Alternatively , in a healthy immune response (right 
side), the initial inflammation attracts virus-​specific T cells to the site of infection, where 
they can eliminate the infected cells before the virus spreads. Neutralizing antibodies  
in these individuals can block viral infection, and alveolar macrophages recognize 
neutralized viruses and apoptotic cells and clear them by phagocytosis. Altogether, 
these processes lead to clearance of the virus and minimal lung damage, resulting in 
recovery. G-​CSF, granulocyte colony-​stimulating factor; TNF, tumour necrosis factor.

S protein may also inhibit virus entry or fusion and are 
further discussed in the section entitled B cell immu-
nity. Nafamostat mesylate48,49 and camostat mesylate44 
are known inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and are currently 
approved in several countries/regions to treat other con-
ditions. While there are no clinical trials specifically test-
ing these drugs against COVID-19 at the time of writing, 
when camostat mesylate was tested on SARS-​CoV-2 iso-
lated from a patient, it prevented entry of the virus into 
lung cells44,50. If this approach is validated, rapid repur-
posing of these drugs will be effective and timely in the 
fight against COVID-19.
Inflammatory immunopathogenesis
SARS-​CoV-2 infection and the destruction of lung cells 
triggers a local immune response, recruiting macro­
phages and monocytes that respond to the infection, 
release cytokines and prime adaptive T and B cell 
immune responses. In most cases, this process is capa-
ble of resolving the infection. However, in some cases, 
a dysfunctional immune response occurs, which can 
cause severe lung and even systemic pathology.
Cytopathic viruses, including SARS-​CoV-2 (ref.51), 
induce death and injury of virus-​infected cells and tis-
sues as part of the virus replicative cycle. Viral infec-
tion and replication in airway epithelial cells52 could 
cause high levels of virus-​linked pyroptosis with asso­
ciated vascular leakage, as seen in patients with SARS- 
​CoV53. Pyroptosis is a highly inflammatory form of 
programmed cell death that is commonly seen with 
cytopathic viruses54. This is a likely trigger for the sub-
sequent inflammatory response55. IL-1β, an impor-
tant cytokine released during pyroptosis, is elevated 
during SARS-​CoV-2 infection11. Using a variety of 
pattern-​recognition receptors (PRRs), alveolar epithe-
lial cells and alveolar macrophages detect the released 
pathogen-​associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such 
as viral RNA, and damage-​associated molecular pat-
terns (DAMPs), including ATP, DNA and ASC oligo­
mers. A wave of local inflammation ensues, involving 
increased secretion of the pro-​inflammatory cytokines 
and chemokines IL-6, IFNγ, MCP1 and IP-10 into the 
blood of afflicted patients11,22. These cytokines are indi-
cators of a T helper 1 (TH1) cell-​polarized response, 
which parallels observations made for SARS-​CoV and 
MERS-​CoV56. Secretion of such cytokines and chemok-
ines attracts immune cells, notably monocytes and 
T lymphocytes, but not neutrophils, from the blood into 
the infected site57,58. Pulmonary recruitment of immune 
cells from the blood and the infiltration of lymphocytes 
into the airways may explain the lymphopenia and 
increased neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio seen in around 
80% of patients with SARS-​CoV-2 infection6,59.
In most individuals, recruited cells clear the infection 
in the lung, the immune response recedes and patients 
recover. However, in some patients, a dysfunctional 
immune response occurs, which triggers a cytokine 
storm that mediates widespread lung inflammation. 
It was observed that patients with severe COVID-19, 
requiring intensive care in hospitals, exhibited higher 
blood plasma levels of IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, granulocyte 
colony-​stimulating factor (G-​CSF), IP-10, MCP1, macro­
phage inflammatory protein 1α (MIP1α) and tumour 
necrosis factor (TNF)11. IL-6 levels in these patients con-
tinue to increase over time and are relatively more ele-
vated in non-​survivors than survivors60. Notably, there 
exists a highly inflammatory monocyte-​derived FCN1+ 
macrophage population in the bronchoalveolar lavage 
fluid of patients with severe but not mild COVID-19 
(ref.61). Also, patients with severe disease show a signifi-
cantly higher percentage of CD14+CD16+ inflammatory 
monocytes in peripheral blood than patients with mild 
disease62. These cells secrete inflammatory cytokines 
that contribute to the cytokine storm, including MCP1, 
IP-10 and MIP1α (Fig. 1).
The mechanisms by which SARS-​CoV-2 subverts 
the body’s innate antiviral cytokine responses are yet to 
be studied, but research on SARS-​CoV shows that mul-
tiple viral structural and non-​structural proteins antago-
nize interferon responses. Antagonism occurs at various 
stages of the interferon signalling pathway, including 
by preventing PRR recognition of viral RNA63–65, by 
preventing PRR signalling through TBK1/inhibitor of 
nuclear factor-​κB kinase subunit-​ε (IKKε), TRAF3 and 
IRF3 (refs63,66), by preventing downstream interferon 
signalling through STAT1 (ref.67) and by promoting 
host mRNA degradation and inhibiting host protein 
translation68. It is very likely that at least some of these 
pathways are conserved in SARS-​CoV-2. Antagonism of 
the interferon response aids viral replication, resulting in 
increased release of pyroptosis products that can further 
induce aberrant inflammatory responses.
Unrestrained inflammatory cell infiltration can 
itself mediate damage in the lung through excessive 
secretion of proteases and reactive oxygen species, in 
addition to the direct damage resulting from the virus. 
Together, these result in diffuse alveolar damage, includ-
ing desquamation of alveolar cells, hyaline membrane 
formation and pulmonary oedema57,58. This limits the

efficiency of gas exchange in the lung, causing difficulty 
in breathing and low blood oxygen levels. The lung also 
becomes more vulnerable to secondary infections.
In addition to local damage, cytokine storm also has 
ripple effects across the body. Elevated levels of cytokines 
such as TNF can cause septic shock and multi-​organ 
failure. These may result in myocardial damage and 
circulatory failure observed in some patients69. Older 
people (those aged over 60 years) and people with 
co-​morbidities are more likely to develop such a dysfunc-
tional immune response that causes pathology and also 
fails to successfully eradicate the pathogen. The exact 
reasons for this are unclear, although one reason may be 
an ageing lung microenvironment causing altered den-
dritic cell maturation and migration to the lymphoid 
organs70, and thereby defective T cell activation. In con-
trast, children tend not to develop severe disease despite 
being capable of experiencing high viral titres71. Across 
all age groups younger than 18 years, more than 50% of 
children experienced mild symptoms or were asympto-
matic, with less than 6% of children developing severe 
symptoms72. Thus, while the aforementioned studies 
represent important inroads, a full picture of the criti-
cal host immune factors that underlie the development 
of severer inflammatory responses in some patients 
remains poorly defined.
It remains controversial whether virus persistence 
is necessary to drive the ongoing damage. The peak of 
viral titres in respiratory tract samples might occur even 
before symptom onset of pneumonia in SARS-​CoV and 
SARS-​CoV-2 infections17,19. However, a large retrospec-
tive cohort study showed that viral RNA was detectable 
in non-​survivors up until the point of death, suggesting 
a correlation between virus persistence and poor disease 
outcome60. As viral RNA may linger even after active 
infection, and is not representative of the infectivity of 
the virus, whether the poor disease outcome is directly 
due to large amounts of infectious particles is specu-
lative at this moment. Furthermore, earlier studies of 
SARS-​CoV found that the virus may infect other targets 
besides lung cells. Notably, virus was found in T lympho-
cytes73, macrophages74–76 and monocyte-​derived den-
dritic cells77. Direct virus killing of lymphocytes could 
contribute to the observed lymphopenia in patients73.

Viral infection in immune cells such as monocytes and 
macrophages can result in aberrant cytokine production, 
even if viral infection is not productive74–77. The degree 
to which SARS-​CoV-2 targets these cells remains poorly 
defined. Understanding the precise drivers of immune 
dysfunction is crucial to guide the application of 
appropriate immunomodulatory treatments.
Several immunosuppressive therapies aimed at 
limiting immunomediated damage in COVID-19 are 
at various phases of development and are listed in 
Table 1. Currently, trials of corticosteroids for treat-
ment of COVID-19 are under way78, although this class 
of treatment was not recommended during the 2003 
SARS epidemic79,80. A clinical trial of the IL-6 antagonist 
tocilizumab is also under way to test its efficacy81, and 
sarilumab is also being explored82. Other clinical trials 
are also testing the effects of targeting granulocyte– 
macrophage colony-​stimulating factor (GM-​CSF), 
including the use of gimsilumab83, lenzilumab84 and 
namilumab85. Another novel adjunctive therapy is 
cytosorb86, which acts by absorbing a broad spectrum 
of cytokines, DAMPs and PAMPs in order to reduce 
their circulating levels and ameliorate immunopathol-
ogy. Thalidomide, an agent with immunomodulatory 
properties, has also been successfully administered to 
a single patient with COVID-19 (ref.87). As a result, two 
clinical trials have now been initiated to test its poten-
tial to reduce lung injury88,89. TNF antagonism was 
suggested but not tested in the context of SARS-​CoV 
infection, and it has not yet been tested in patients with 
COVID-19 (ref.90). A small open-​label, non-​randomized 
study suggested that a combination of hydroxychloro-
quine (a known antimalarial agent) and azithromycin 
(a common antibiotic) may be beneficial for treat-
ing patients with severe COVID-19 (ref.91). Although 
hydroxychloroquine’s effect on direct inhibition of the 
virus92 and its anti-​inflammatory and immunomod-
ulatory activities are known93, whether these mech-
anisms play a role against COVID-19 remains to be 
determined94.

T cell immunity
Both T and B cell responses against SARS-​CoV-2 are 
detected in the blood around 1 week after the onset 
of COVID-19 symptoms. CD8+ T cells are important 
for directly attacking and killing virus-​infected cells, 
whereas CD4+ T cells are crucial to prime both CD8+ 
T cells and B cells. CD4+ T cells are also responsible 
for cytokine production to drive immune cell recruit-
ment. The first autopsy of a patient with COVID-19 
revealed an accumulation of mononuclear cells (likely 
monocytes and T cells) in the lungs, coupled with low 
levels of hyperactive T cells in the peripheral blood57. 
Together with reports of lymphopenia and reduced 
peripheral T cell levels in patients 6,95–97, these findings 
suggest that T cells are attracted away from the blood 
and into the infected site to control the viral infection. 
In patients with COVID-19, increased T cell exhaus-
tion and reduced functional diversity predicted severe 
disease98. Despite the impaired response, patients 
who recovered from SARS-​CoV infection developed 
coronavirus-​specific memory T cells, which were found 
up to 2 years after recovery99,100.
SARS-​CoV-​specific CD4+ T cells express IFNγ, TNF 
and IL-2, which suggests that patients with SARS-​CoV 
infection exhibit a TH1 cell response and mainly use cel-
lular immunity to control the infection101,102. Although 
this pro-​inflammatory profile may be an aggravating 
factor for immunopathogenesis, CD4+ T cells have been 
hypothesized to control SARS, as depletion of these cells 
in mice resulted in slower clearance of the virus from the 
host and severer lung inflammation103. With the use of a 
mouse-​adapted strain of SARS-​CoV, immunization with 
dendritic cells bearing SARS-​CoV peptides resulted in 
higher numbers of virus-​specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells 
that accumulated in the lungs and increased survival104,105. 
Also, transfer of SARS-​CoV-​specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells 
into immunodeficient mice resulted in better protection 
against a mouse-​adapted strain of SARS-​CoV105.
Despite evidence for an important role of T cells in con-
trolling infection, several vaccine formulations against 
SARS-​CoV previously tested in animal models showed 
signs of immunopathology associated with TH2 cell- 
​mediated eosinophil infiltration106,107. In particular, aged 
mice that were vaccinated seemed to display increased 
immunopathology rather than protection108. Further 
study of the nature of protective versus detrimental T cell 
responses is critically needed to determine the optimal 
T cell engagement strategies for vaccines109.
Coronavirus-​specific T cells are clearly important in 
eliminating the virus and controlling disease development 
and should be considered in vaccine strategies. However, 
whether T cell responses alone are capable of prevent-
ing infection in human settings remains to be investi-
gated. This knowledge will be important for vaccine 
development.
B cell immunity
B cell responses in patients with COVID-19 occur con-
comitantly with T follicular helper cell responses, from 
around 1 week after symptom onset110. In patients with 
SARS-​CoV infection, B cell responses typically arise first 
against the nucleocapsid (N) protein. Within 4–8 days 
after symptom onset, antibody responses to S protein are 
found111,112. Neutralizing antibody responses, likely to the 
S protein, begin to develop by week 2, and most patients 
develop neutralizing antibodies by week 3 (refs113,114). 
Given that viral titres peak earlier for SARS-​CoV-2 than for 
SARS-​CoV16–19, antibody responses may also arise earlier. 
It seems that a subset of patients may not develop long-​ 
lasting antibodies to SARS-​CoV-2 (ref.115). It remains 
unknown whether these patients are susceptible to reinfec-
tion, of which there are sporadic reports116,117. Antibodies 
are likely to be effective against SARS-​CoV-2: convalescent 
serum samples have been applied with apparently good clin-
ical results in COVID-19 (ref.118) and were also previously 
used successfully in the treatment of SARS119–121.
While mechanistic correlates of protection have not 
yet been identified in humans, neutralization of the virus 
is presumed to be an important mechanism of action 
for antibodies, although the specific titre and specific-
ity of the antibody repertoire required (for protection) 
remain undefined. In SARS-​CoV, the primary target 
of neutralizing antibodies is the RBD122, comprising a 193 
amino acid region (amino acids 318–510) in the S pro­
tein, which can independently bind to the host target 
ACE2 receptor35–37. Although a few previously identified 
monoclonal antibodies to SARS-​CoV also bind to or neu-
tralize SARS-​CoV-2 (ref.123), the majority do not124. This 
could be due to significant differences in the RBDs of 
SARS-​CoV-2 and SARS-​CoV (Fig. 4). In particular, of the 
33 amino acids in the region (amino acids 460–492) in 
the SARS-​CoV S protein that contains the critical residues 
that contact ACE2 (ref.125), less than half (15/33) are con-
served in SARS-​CoV-2. Nevertheless, mouse antiserum 
raised against SARS-​CoV protein can cross-​neutralize 
SARS-​CoV-2 pseudovirus, indicating overlapping 
neutralizing epitopes between the two viruses28,126.
In China, hospitals have initiated the use of con-
valescent plasma as a source of therapeutic polyclonal 
antibodies for treatment of COVID-19, and early data 
suggest a positive impact on respiratory viral load and 
mortality127,128. Efforts are under way to develop ther-
apeutic monoclonal antibodies to SARS-​CoV-2, using 
approaches including phage library display, traditional 
mouse immunization and hybridoma isolation, and 
cloning of B cell sequences from convalescent human 
patients129–132. SARS-​CoV does not appear to have strong 
mechanisms to escape or prevent antibody neutraliza-
tion, such as glycan shielding of the receptor-​binding site 
against antibody binding133. This is further corroborated 
by the fact that patients with SARS-​CoV infection were 
generally capable of developing neutralizing antibodies. 
A recombinant S protein fragment that included the 
RBD of SARS-​CoV showed the highest immunogenic-
ity relative to other recombinant S protein fragments 
tested, suggesting that the immune system is capable 
of targeting neutralizing epitopes effectively134. Thus, 
if SARS-​CoV-2 behaves like SARS-​CoV in this respect, it 
is likely that these efforts will be successful in developing 
neutralizing monoclonal antibodies.
It is possible that alterations in the S protein will ren-
der SARS-​CoV-2 resistant to some monoclonal antibod-
ies, especially as it spreads and mutates. As of now, the 
entire RBD remains conserved, and there are only four

known rare non-​synonymous alterations in the S pro-
tein: V483A, L455I, F456V and G476S135. The V483A 
alteration maps to a similar natural alteration found 
in MERS-​CoV, I529T, where it reduced viral protein 
binding to the host receptor target and also increased 
resistance to antibody neutralization from serum sam-
ples from patients with MERS136. F456V and G476S 
alterations also map to similar alteration positions in 
SARS-​CoV (L443R and D463G), which were found in a 
panel of neutralization escape mutants137.
However, the selection of therapeutic antibody can-
didates should include careful consideration of potential 
unwanted side effects. For example, pre-​existing antibodies 
to other coronaviruses may exacerbate SARS-​CoV infec-
tions through antibody-​dependent enhancement138–140. 
Also, previous studies in animal models showed 
that in SARS-​CoV infection, neutralizing antibodies

to S protein can potentially augment severe lung injury 
by exacerbating inflammatory responses141. In addition, 
a correlation has been observed where development of 
ARDS coincides with antiviral IgG seroconversion in 
80% of patients19. Patients who developed neutralizing 
antibodies to S protein earlier in infection had a higher 
rate of disease; it took an average of only 14.7 days for 
patients who died of infection to reach their peak levels 
of neutralizing antibody activity, as opposed to 20 days 
for patients who went on to recover142. Similarly, for 
MERS, patients with severer disease appear to have higher 
antibody titres than those with mild disease143,144, although 
one study argues that it is a delay in the development of 
antibody responses that is associated with disease145. The 
binding of antibody–virus immune complexes to activat-
ing Fc receptors on alveolar macrophages could induce 
the expression of pro-​inflammatory factors, including

IL-8 and MCP1, which add to the immunostimulatory 
milieu146. Such complexes may also activate the comple-
ment system and lead to further unwanted inflamma-
tion141. As a result, it is important to consider engineering 
therapeutic antibodies with little or no pro-​inflammatory 
activity but that retain their virus-​neutralizing capacity147. 
For instance, alterations could be made to the Fc region 
and/or its glycosylation to change its binding affinity for 
activating Fc receptors146,148.
Conclusion
This Review has presented the various mechanisms of 
SARS-​CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 immunopatho-
genesis. Controlling the inflammatory response may be 
as important as targeting the virus. Therapies inhibiting 
viral infection and regulation of dysfunctional immune 
responses may synergize to block pathologies at multiple 
steps. At the same time, the association between immune 
dysfunction and outcome of disease severity in patients 
with COVID-19 should serve as a note of caution in vaccine 
development and evaluation. Further studies of the host 
immune response to SARS-​CoV-2 are necessary, includ-
ing a detailed investigation of the determinants of healthy 
versus dysfunctional outcomes. These will also help iden-
tify biomarkers to define immune correlates of protection 
and disease severity for effective triage of patients.
