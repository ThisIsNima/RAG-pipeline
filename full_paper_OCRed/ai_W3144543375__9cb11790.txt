The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, published in 2009, was
designed to help systematic reviewers transparently report
why the review was done, what the authors did, and what
they found. Over the past decade, advances in systematic re-
view methodology and terminology have necessitated an up-
date to the guideline. The PRISMA 2020 statement replaces
the 2009 statement and includes new reporting guidance
that reflects advances in methods to identify, select, ap-
praise, and synthesise studies. The structure and presenta-
tion
of
the
items
have
been
modified
to
facilitate
implementation. In this article, we present the PRISMA
2020 27-item checklist, an expanded checklist that details
reporting recommendations for each item, the PRISMA
2020 abstract checklist, and the revised flow diagrams for
original and updated reviews. In order to encourage its
wide dissemination this article is freely accessible on BMJ,
PLOS Medicine, Journal of Clinical Epidemiology and Inter-
national Journal of Surgery journal websites.
Systematic reviews serve many critical roles. They can
provide syntheses of the state of knowledge in a field, from
which future research priorities can be identified; they can
address questions that otherwise could not be answered by
individual studies; they can identify problems in primary re-
search that should be rectified in future studies; and they
can generate or evaluate theories about how or why phe-
nomena occur. Systematic reviews therefore generate vari-
ous types of knowledge for different users of reviews (such
as patients, healthcare providers, researchers, and policy
makers) [1, 2]. To ensure a systematic review is valuable to
users, authors should prepare a transparent, complete, and
accurate account of why the review was done, what they
did (such as how studies were identified and selected) and
what they found (such as characteristics of contributing
studies and results of meta-analyses). Up-to-date reporting
guidance facilitates authors achieving this [3].
The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews
and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement published in 2009
(hereafter referred to as PRISMA 2009) [4–10] is a report-
ing guideline designed to address poor reporting of system-
atic reviews [11]. The PRISMA 2009 statement comprised
a checklist of 27 items recommended for reporting in sys-
tematic reviews and an “explanation and elaboration” paper
[12–16] providing additional reporting guidance for each
item, along with exemplars of reporting. The recommenda-
tions have been widely endorsed and adopted, as evidenced
by its co-publication in multiple journals, citation in over
60,000 reports (Scopus, August 2020), endorsement from
almost 200 journals and systematic review organisations,
and adoption in various disciplines. Evidence from observa-
tional studies suggests that use of the PRISMA 2009 state-
ment is associated with more complete reporting of
systematic reviews [17–20], although more could be done
to improve adherence to the guideline [21].
Many innovations in the conduct of systematic reviews
have occurred since publication of the PRISMA 2009
statement. For example, technological advances have en-
abled the use of natural language processing and ma-
chine learning to identify relevant evidence [22–24],
methods have been proposed to synthesise and present

findings when meta-analysis is not possible or appro-
priate [25–27], and new methods have been devel-
oped to assess the risk of bias in results of included
studies [28, 29]. Evidence on sources of bias in sys-
tematic reviews has accrued, culminating in the devel-
opment of new tools to appraise the conduct of
systematic reviews [30, 31]. Terminology used to de-
scribe particular review processes has also evolved, as
in the shift from assessing “quality” to assessing “cer-
tainty” in the body of evidence [32]. In addition, the
publishing landscape has transformed, with multiple
avenues now available for registering and disseminat-
ing systematic review protocols [33, 34], disseminating
reports of systematic reviews, and sharing data and
materials, such as preprint servers and publicly ac-
cessible repositories. To capture these advances in the
reporting of systematic reviews necessitated an update
to the PRISMA 2009 statement.
Summary points
• To ensure a systematic review is valuable to users, authors should
prepare a transparent, complete, and accurate account of why the
review was done, what they did, and what they found
• The PRISMA 2020 statement provides updated reporting guidance for
systematic reviews that reflects advances in methods to identify, select,
appraise, and synthesise studies
• The PRISMA 2020 statement consists of a 27-item checklist, an ex-
panded checklist that details reporting recommendations for each
item, the PRISMA 2020 abstract checklist, and revised flow diagrams for
original and updated reviews
• We anticipate that the PRISMA 2020 statement will benefit authors,
editors, and peer reviewers of systematic reviews, and different users of
reviews, including guideline developers, policy makers, healthcare
providers, patients, and other stakeholders
Development of PRISMA 2020
A
complete
description
of
the
methods
used
to
develop PRISMA 2020 is available elsewhere [35].
We identified PRISMA 2009 items that were often
reported incompletely by examining the results of
studies investigating the transparency of reporting of
published reviews [17, 21, 36, 37]. We identified
possible
modifications
to
the
PRISMA
2009
statement
by
reviewing
60
documents
providing
reporting guidance for systematic reviews (including
reporting guidelines, handbooks, tools, and meta-
research studies) [38]. These reviews of the literature
were used to inform the content of a survey with
suggested possible modifications to the 27 items in
PRISMA 2009 and possible additional items. Respon-
dents were asked whether they believed we should
keep each PRISMA 2009 item as is, modify it, or re-
move it, and whether we should add each additional
item. Systematic review methodologists and journal
editors were invited to complete the online survey
(110 of 220 invited responded). We discussed pro-
posed content and wording of the PRISMA 2020
statement, as informed by the review and survey re-
sults, at a 21-member, two-day, in-person meeting in
September 2018 in Edinburgh, Scotland. Throughout
2019 and 2020, we circulated an initial draft and five
revisions of the checklist and explanation and elab-
oration paper to co-authors for feedback. In April
2020, we invited 22 systematic reviewers who had
expressed interest in providing feedback on the PRIS
MA 2020 checklist to share their views (via an on-
line survey) on the layout and terminology used in a
preliminary version of the checklist. Feedback was
received from 15 individuals and considered by the
first author, and any revisions deemed necessary
were incorporated before the final version was ap-
proved and endorsed by all co-authors.
The PRISMA 2020 statement
Scope of the guideline
The
PRISMA
2020
statement
has
been
designed
primarily
for
systematic
reviews
of
studies
that
evaluate
the
effects
of
health
interventions,
irrespective of the design of the included studies.
However,
the
checklist
items
are
applicable
to
reports
of
systematic
reviews
evaluating
other
interventions
(such
as
social
or
educational
interventions),
and
many
items
are
applicable
to
systematic
reviews
with
objectives
other
than
evaluating interventions (such as evaluating aetiology,
prevalence, or prognosis). PRISMA 2020 is intended
for use in systematic reviews that include synthesis
(such as pairwise meta-analysis or other statistical
synthesis methods) or do not include synthesis (for
example, because only one eligible study is identi-
fied).
The
PRISMA
2020
items
are
relevant
for
mixed-methods
systematic
reviews
(which
include
quantitative and qualitative studies), but reporting
guidelines addressing the presentation and synthesis
of qualitative data should also be consulted [39, 40].
PRISMA 2020 can be used for original systematic re-
views, updated systematic reviews, or continually up-
dated
(“living”)
systematic
reviews.
However,
for
updated and living systematic reviews, there may be
some additional considerations that need to be ad-
dressed. Where there is relevant content from other
reporting guidelines, we reference these guidelines
within the items in the explanation and elaboration
paper [41] (such as PRISMA-Search [42] in items 6
and
7,
Synthesis
without
meta-analysis
(SWiM)
reporting guideline [27] in item 13d). Box 1 includes
a glossary of terms used throughout the PRISMA
2020 statement.

PRISMA 2020 is not intended to guide systematic
review conduct, for which comprehensive resources are
available [43–46]. However, familiarity with PRISMA 2020
is useful when planning and conducting systematic
reviews to ensure that all recommended information is
captured. PRISMA 2020 should not be used to assess the
conduct or methodological quality of systematic reviews;
other tools exist for this purpose [30, 31]. Furthermore,
PRISMA 2020 is not intended to inform the reporting of
systematic
review
protocols,
for
which
a
separate
statement is available (PRISMA for Protocols (PRISMA-P)
2015 statement [47, 48]). Finally, extensions to the PRIS
MA 2009 statement have been developed to guide
reporting of network meta-analyses [49], meta-analyses of
individual participant data [50], systematic reviews of
harms [51], systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy
studies [52], and scoping reviews [53]; for these types of
reviews we recommend authors report their review in ac-
cordance with the recommendations in PRISMA 2020
along with the guidance specific to the extension.
How to use PRISMA 2020
The
PRISMA
2020
statement
(including
the
checklists,
explanation
and
elaboration,
and
flow
diagram) replaces the PRISMA 2009 statement, which
should
no
longer
be
used.
Box
2
summarises
noteworthy
changes
from
the
PRISMA
2009
statement. The PRISMA 2020 checklist includes seven
sections with 27 items, some of which include sub-
items (Table 1). A checklist for journal and confer-
ence abstracts for systematic reviews is included in
PRISMA 2020. This abstract checklist is an update of
the
2013
PRISMA
for
Abstracts
statement
[54],
reflecting new and modified content in PRISMA 2020
(Table 2). A template PRISMA flow diagram is pro-
vided, which can be modified depending on whether
the systematic review is original or updated (Fig. 1).
We recommend authors refer to PRISMA 2020 early
in the writing process, because prospective consideration
of the items may help to ensure that all the items are
addressed. To help keep track of which items have been
reported, the PRISMA statement website (http://www.
prisma-statement.org/) includes fillable templates of the
checklists to download and complete (also available in
Additional
file
1).
We
have
also
created
a
web
application that allows users to complete the checklist
via a user-friendly interface [58] (available at https://
prisma.shinyapps.io/checklist/
and
adapted
from
the
Transparency Checklist app [59]). The completed check-
list can be exported to Word or PDF. Editable templates
of the flow diagram can also be downloaded from the
PRISMA statement website.
We
have
prepared
an
updated
explanation
and
elaboration paper, in which we explain why reporting
of each item is recommended and present bullet
Box 1 Glossary of terms
Systematic review—A review that uses explicit, systematic methods to collate and synthesise findings of studies that address a clearly
formulated question [43]
Statistical synthesis—The combination of quantitative results of two or more studies. This encompasses meta-analysis of effect estimates
(described below) and other methods, such as combining P values, calculating the range and distribution of observed effects, and vote
counting based on the direction of effect (see McKenzie and Brennan [25] for a description of each method)
Meta-analysis of effect estimates—A statistical technique used to synthesise results when study effect estimates and their variances are
available, yielding a quantitative summary of results [25]
Outcome—An event or measurement collected for participants in a study (such as quality of life, mortality)
Result—The combination of a point estimate (such as a mean difference, risk ratio, or proportion) and a measure of its precision (such as
a confidence/credible interval) for a particular outcome
Report—A document (paper or electronic) supplying information about a particular study. It could be a journal article, preprint,
conference abstract, study register entry, clinical study report, dissertation, unpublished manuscript, government report, or any other
document providing relevant information
Record—The title or abstract (or both) of a report indexed in a database or website (such as a title or abstract for an article indexed in
Medline). Records that refer to the same report (such as the same journal article) are “duplicates”; however, records that refer to reports
that are merely similar (such as a similar abstract submitted to two different conferences) should be considered unique.
Study—An investigation, such as a clinical trial, that includes a defined group of participants and one or more interventions and
outcomes. A “study” might have multiple reports. For example, reports could include the protocol, statistical analysis plan, baseline
characteristics, results for the primary outcome, results for harms, results for secondary outcomes, and results for additional mediator and
moderator analyses

points
that
detail
the
reporting
recommendations
(which we refer to as elements) [41]. The bullet-point
structure is new to PRISMA 2020 and has been
adopted to facilitate implementation of the guidance
[60, 61]. An expanded checklist, which comprises an
abridged version of the elements presented in the ex-
planation and elaboration paper, with references and
some examples removed, is available in Additional file
2. Consulting the explanation and elaboration paper is
recommended
if
further
clarity
or
information
is
required.
Journals and publishers might impose word and
section limits, and limits on the number of tables and
figures allowed in the main report. In such cases, if
the
relevant
information
for
some
items
already
appears
in
a
publicly
accessible
review
protocol,
referring to the protocol may suffice. Alternatively,
placing detailed descriptions of the methods used or
additional results (such as for less critical outcomes)
in
supplementary
files
is
recommended.
Ideally,
supplementary files should be deposited to a general-
purpose or institutional open-access repository that
provides free and permanent access to the material
(such as Open Science Framework, Dryad, figshare).
A reference or link to the additional information
should be included in the main report. Finally, al-
though PRISMA 2020 provides a template for where
information might be located, the suggested location
should
not
be
seen
as
prescriptive;
the
guiding
principle is to ensure the information is reported.
Discussion
Use of PRISMA 2020 has the potential to benefit many
stakeholders.
Complete
reporting
allows
readers
to
assess the appropriateness of the methods, and therefore
the trustworthiness of the findings. Presenting and
summarising characteristics of studies contributing to a
synthesis allows healthcare providers and policy makers
to evaluate the applicability of the findings to their
setting. Describing the certainty in the body of evidence
for an outcome and the implications of findings should
help
policy
makers,
managers,
and
other
decision
makers
formulate
appropriate
recommendations
for
practice or policy. Complete reporting of all PRISMA
Box 2 Noteworthy changes to the PRISMA 2009 statement
• Inclusion of the abstract reporting checklist within PRISMA 2020 (see item #2 and Box 2).
• Movement of the ‘Protocol and registration’ item from the start of the Methods section of the checklist to a new Other section, with addition
of a sub-item recommending authors describe amendments to information provided at registration or in the protocol (see item #24a-24c).
• Modification of the ‘Search’ item to recommend authors present full search strategies for all databases, registers and websites searched,
not just at least one database (see item #7).

each report retrieved, whether they worked independently, and if applicable, details of automation tools used in the process (see item #8).
• Addition of a sub-item to the ‘Data items’ item recommending authors report how outcomes were defined, which results were sought,
and methods for selecting a subset of results from included studies (see item #10a).
• Splitting of the ‘Synthesis of results’ item in the Methods section into six sub-items recommending authors describe: the processes
used to decide which studies were eligible for each synthesis; any methods required to prepare the data for synthesis; any methods
used to tabulate or visually display results of individual studies and syntheses; any methods used to synthesise results; any methods used
to explore possible causes of heterogeneity among study results (such as subgroup analysis, meta-regression); and any sensitivity
analyses used to assess robustness of the synthesised results (see item #13a-13f).
• Addition of a sub-item to the ‘Study selection’ item in the Results section recommending authors cite studies that might appear to
meet the inclusion criteria, but which were excluded, and explain why they were excluded (see item #16b).
• Splitting of the ‘Synthesis of results’ item in the Results section into four sub-items recommending authors: briefly summarise the characteristics
and risk of bias among studies contributing to the synthesis; present results of all statistical syntheses conducted; present results of any
investigations of possible causes of heterogeneity among study results; and present results of any sensitivity analyses (see item #20a-20d).
• Addition of new items recommending authors report methods for and results of an assessment of certainty (or confidence) in the
body of evidence for an outcome (see items #15 and #22).
• Addition of a new item recommending authors declare any competing interests (see item #26).
• Addition of a new item recommending authors indicate whether data, analytic code and other materials used in the review are
publicly available and if so, where they can be found (see item #27).

We updated the PRISMA 2009 statement by adapting
the

for
developing
health research reporting guidelines [64]. We evaluated
the reporting completeness of published systematic
reviews [17, 21, 36, 37], reviewed the items included in
other documents providing guidance for systematic
reviews [38], surveyed systematic review methodologists
and journal editors for their views on how to revise the
original PRISMA statement [35], discussed the findings
at an in-person meeting, and prepared this document
through an iterative process. Our recommendations are
informed by the reviews and survey conducted before
the in-person meeting, theoretical considerations about
which items facilitate replication and help users assess

and co-authors’ experience with authoring and using
systematic reviews.
Various strategies to increase the use of reporting
guidelines and improve reporting have been proposed.
They include educators introducing reporting guidelines
into graduate curricula to promote good reporting
habits of early career scientists [65]; journal editors and
regulators endorsing use of reporting guidelines [18];
peer
reviewers
evaluating
adherence
to
reporting
guidelines [61, 66]; journals requiring authors to indicate
where in their manuscript they have adhered to each
reporting item [67]; and authors using online writing
tools that prompt complete reporting at the writing
stage [60]. Multi-pronged interventions, where more
than one of these strategies are combined, may be more
effective (such as completion of checklists coupled with
editorial checks) [68]. However, of 31 interventions pro-
posed to increase adherence to reporting guidelines, the
effects of only 11 have been evaluated, mostly in obser-
vational studies at high risk of bias due to confounding
[69]. It is therefore unclear which strategies should be
used. Future research might explore barriers and facilita-
tors to the use of PRISMA 2020 by authors, editors, and
peer reviewers, designing interventions that address the
identified barriers, and evaluating those interventions
using randomised trials. To inform possible revisions to
the guideline, it would also be valuable to conduct
think-aloud studies [70] to understand how systematic
reviewers interpret the items, and reliability studies to
identify items where there is varied interpretation of the
items.
We encourage readers to submit evidence that informs
any of the recommendations in PRISMA 2020 (via the PRIS
MA statement website: http://www.prisma-statement.org/).
To enhance accessibility of PRISMA 2020, several

the
guideline

to raise awareness of PRISMA 2020 (for example, by
referring to it in journal “Instructions to authors”),
endorsing its use, advising editors and peer reviewers
to evaluate submitted systematic reviews against the
PRISMA

checklists,
and
making
changes
to
journal policies to accommodate the new reporting
recommendations. We recommend existing PRISMA
extensions [47, 49–53, 71, 72] be updated to reflect

Conclusion
We anticipate that the PRISMA 2020 statement will
benefit authors, editors, and peer reviewers of systematic
reviews,
and
different
users
of
reviews,
including
guideline
developers,
policy
makers,
healthcare
providers, patients, and other stakeholders. Ultimately,
we hope that uptake of the guideline will lead to more
transparent,
complete,
and
accurate
reporting
of
systematic
reviews,
thus
facilitating
evidence
based
decision making.

Authors’ contributions
JEM and DM are joint senior authors. MJP, JEM, PMB, IB, TCH, CDM, LS, and
DM conceived this paper and designed the literature review and survey
conducted to inform the guideline content. MJP conducted the literature
review, administered the survey and analysed the data for both. MJP
prepared all materials for the development meeting. MJP and JEM presented
Fig. 1 PRISMA 2020 flow diagram template for systematic reviews. The new design is adapted from flow diagrams proposed by Boers [55],
Mayo-Wilson et al. [56] and Stovold et al. [57] The boxes in grey should only be completed if applicable; otherwise they should be removed from
the flow diagram. Note that a “report” could be a journal article, preprint, conference abstract, study register entry, clinical study report,
dissertation, unpublished manuscript, government report or any other document providing relevant information
