Demand Driven 
Acquisition (DDA)
Build your collection with ebooks  
that reflect user needs
Demand-Driven Acquisition 
(DDA), pioneered by 
ProQuest nearly two 
decades ago, enables libraries 
to offer on-demand access to 
a vast selection of ebooks. 
With this flexible acquisition 
model, users can instantly 
access thousands of titles, 
enhancing their learning and 
research experiences.  
Purchases or loans are 
triggered only after a 
meaningful user engagement 
or actions like downloading or 
printing, making it a win-win 
for both libraries and users.
By tapping into real-time user 
needs, DDA helps libraries 
build collections that are both 
relevant and cost-effective. 
Librarians can manage DDA 
programs through Ebook 
Central, Rialto, and OASIS.

Why Demand-Driven Acquisition (DDA)?
Maximize your 
budget efficiency
With DDA, libraries can 
select from over 2 million 
titles, offering users 
broad ebook access while 
directing funds to materials 
that are actively utilized.
Libraries can establish 
specific price rules, set 
spending limits, automate 
budget tracking and 
create customizable alerts 
to help ensure balanced 
budgeting.
DDA empowers you to 
build a collection that truly 
reflects the needs of your 
academic community. 
Create user-centric 
collections
Maintain full control 
over acquisitions
Enhance access  
and ownership
Innovative models like 
Access to Own (ATO)* 
enable you to grow your 
ebook collections by 
applying loan expenditures 
toward perpetual 
purchases. 
As your library evolves, 
DDA can easily scale to 
accommodate new trends 
and emerging subjects in 
academic research. 
Mediated DDA allows 
libraries to make data-
driven decisions and 
maintain control over 
title selection, with staff 
approval required for all 
acquisitions.
Utilize data-driven 
insights
Ensure scalability 
and adaptability
*ATO, exclusive to ProQuest, attributes library loan spending to title ownership.

Flavors of DDA: 
Customize your program
Save time browsing by 
leveraging ProQuest’s 
Collection Development 
expertise and flexible 
purchasing models - 
Perpetual Access, DDA,  
STL, ATO - to acquire  
high-quality ebooks. 
Explore recently published 
titles from the past 2-3 years, 
with no duplication of past 
offerings. Whether you need 
full sets or individual titles, 
acquire content seamlessly 
through LibCentral, OASIS,  
or Rialto.
Traditional DDA
Titles are only triggered for 
purchase or loan if used, and 
librarians have complete 
control over the subjects, 
publishers, cost, publication 
dates and other parameters for 
their consideration pools. 
Short-Term Loans (STL) 
As part of their DDA programs, 
libraries can choose to take 
affordable STLs without 
commitment to purchase. Most 
libraries offer these just-in-time 
rentals to provide immediate 
access that users expect, 
however STLs can also be 
mediated.
Access-to-Own (ATO) 
A mix of traditional DDA and 
STL where loan fees contribute 
towards buying  the book. 
Librarians have complete 
control over their selection 
pools, which are immediately 
discoverable and accessible 
to researchers, and loans are 
only purchased if ebooks are 
used. For libraries that prefer 
ownership, ATO is a useful 
tool.
We understand that DDA is not a one-size-fits-all acquisition model. 
It continues to evolve, offering enhanced flexibility and value, with 
several tailored options, including:

Access
“Using DDA allows us to 
understand patron needs more 
directly, which means we are 
spending our funds on content 
that better fills their needs 
and that is ultimately what is 
important.”

Why librarians love 
Demand Driven Acquisition
“We have compared usage 
expenditures of DDA 
purchases and short-term loans 
with past spending and usage 
patterns. So far, we have found 
that while spending is slightly 
increased, usage has been 
greatly increased.”
