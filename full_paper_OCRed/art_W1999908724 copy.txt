The long-standing challenge of designing and constructing new crystalline solid-state materials from molecular building blocks is
just beginning to be addressed with success. A conceptual approach that requires the use of secondary building units to direct the
assembly of ordered frameworks epitomizes this process: we call this approach reticular synthesis. This chemistry has yielded
materials designed to have predetermined structures, compositions and properties. In particular, highly porous frameworks held
together by strong metal–oxygen–carbon bonds and with exceptionally large surface area and capacity for gas storage have been
prepared and their pore metrics systematically varied and functionalized.
A
lthough the synthesis of new materials has long been
recognized as the most essential element in advancing
technology, it generally remains more of an art than a
science—in that the discovery of new compounds has
mostly been serendipitous, using methods referred to by
critics as ‘shake and bake’, ‘mix and wait’ and ‘heat and beat’. For
much of the twentieth century, this worked well for the synthesis of
important solid-state materials, and we expect that it will continue
to yield interesting compounds. However, it is becoming increas-
ingly urgent to produce materials designed to perform highly
speciﬁc and cooperative functions1,2.
Recent extensive research into the design and synthesis of metal-
organic frameworks (MOFs) has led to numerous practical and
conceptual developments in that direction3–7. Speciﬁcally, the
chemistry of MOFs has provided an extensive class of crystalline
materials with high stability, tunable metrics, organic functionality,
and porosity. Here we present some of the important developments
that have shaped this rapidly growing ﬁeld and propose a general
conceptual framework, which serves as a useful tool in designing
materials constructed from molecular building blocks.
Reticular synthesis
General lack of control over the character of solids produced from
the traditional synthetic methods is directly related to the fact
that the starting entities do not maintain their structure during
the reaction, leading to poor correlation between reactants and
products. We have shown that the design of an extended network
can be realized by starting with well-deﬁned and rigid molecular
building blocks that will maintain their structural integrity
throughout the construction process3,8. Alternatively, the use of
well-deﬁned conditions that lead to the formation of such building
blocks in situ is an equally viable approach to the design of extended
structures and one that has been especially fruitful in MOF
chemistry8. We have shown8,9 that the practice of logical synthesis
must begin with knowledge of the target network ‘blueprint’ and
identiﬁcation of the required building blocks for its assembly.
This process is central to our ability to achieve true design of
solid-state materials: we refer to its implementation as reticular
synthesis.
In essence, reticular synthesis can be described as the process of
assembling judiciously designed rigid molecular building blocks
into predetermined ordered structures (networks), which are held
together by strong bonding. It is different from retrosynthesis of
organic compounds10, because the structural integrity and rigidity
of the building blocks in reticular synthesis remain unaltered
throughout the construction process—an important aspect that
could help to realize fully the beneﬁts of design in crystalline
solid-state frameworks. Similarly, reticular synthesis should be
distinguished from supramolecular assembly11, because in the
former, building blocks are linked by strong bonds throughout
the crystal.
In this context, it is worth noting that a plethora of extended
structures successfully prepared by copolymerization of metal ions
with organic links have been reported and reviewed under the
rubric of ‘crystal engineering’, a term which has mutated somewhat
over the years and which is now rather broadly deﬁned12–14. We use
the more precise term reticular synthesis (or chemistry) to describe
the logical approach to the synthesis of robust materials with pre-
designed building blocks, extended structures, and properties.
Thus, it might be considered a subclass of crystal engineering.
Research in the area of MOFs and, to a lesser extent, inorganic
frameworks, has recently progressed far enough to provide
examples which show the feasibility of the building-block approach
and the scope of reticular synthesis. Here we take selected examples
to highlight the ideas involved, with emphasis on our own work on
MOFs in which structural and thermal stability characterization
have been combined with in-depth studies of surface area and gas
sorption capacities. The subject of metal-organic frameworks has a
long history, however, so we begin by giving some perspectives on
the ﬁeld.
Perspectives and challenges
The Cambridge Structure Database (CSD) documents the crystal
structures of more than 11,000 extended metal-organic compounds
in which a metal ion or cluster has been linked by an organic moiety
in which the linking functionality is a cyanide, pyridyl, phosphate
or carboxylate. Of these, nearly 3,000 compounds have three-
dimensional (3D) structures and about double that number have
2D structures. MOFs composed of the ﬁrst-row transition metals
and organic links such as cyanide15,16, glutamate17, formate18,
triazole19, oxalate20, 1,2,4,5-tetracarboxylates21 and squarates22
have long been known. Also, expanded diamond structures based
on linking of Cu(I) with ANT23, DCNQ24 and TCTPM25, and
decorated diamond structures based on linking Mn(II) with
Ge4S10
42 (T2) clusters9 (see Box 1 for abbreviations of chemical
names and clariﬁcation of terms) represent the numerous fore-
runners of the extended structures constructed from molecular
building blocks. Subsequently, other compounds based on linking
metal ions with ADC26, ETC27, INT28, BPY29,30 and BPCN31 have
been reported. Tetrahedral building blocks such as HMT32 and

MCP33 have been linked by metal ions to form decorated diamond
structures, while TPY34 and ATC35 are examples of links pre-
designed so that their assembly into diamond networks is done by
linking through hydrogen bonding.
Consideration of this range of crystal structures, in particular
those of MOFs, has led us to identify two critical questions for
reticular synthesis. First, of the almost unlimited possible networks,
which can be expected to form and how can they be synthesized?
Box 1
Deﬁnitions and structures
Here we deﬁne some terms and illustrate organic species referred to in
the text by abbreviations in the Box 1 ﬁgure.
Reticular: (adjective) having the form of a (usually periodic) net.
Isoreticular: Based on the same net (having the same topology).
MOF-n: Metal-organic framework (with n an integer assigned in
roughly chronological order).
IRMOF-n: Isoreticular MOF (with n an integer referring to a member
of the series).
Interpenetration: A term used to describe the mutual intergrowth of
two or more networks in a structure where the networks are physically
but not chemically linked. See refs 4 and 8 for reviews on this
property.
Expansion: Increasing the spacing between vertices in a network.
Decoration: Replacing a vertex in a net by a group of vertices.
SBU: The term ‘secondary building unit’ has been used for some
time to describe conceptual fragments of zeolites; in the context of
reticular chemistry it refers to the geometry of the units deﬁned by the
points of extension (such as the carboxylate C atoms in most
carboxylate MOFs).

Second, with few exceptions, MOFs based on M-N linkages inwhich
the vertex of the network is just a single atom have a tendency to
form structures which collapse upon removal of ‘guest’ atoms from
the pores, rendering the structure nonporous. How then can we
ensure that our structures will be robust?
Secondary building units
To address these questions it is important to ﬁrst appreciate that it is
difﬁcult (although not impossible) to attempt a priori synthesis of
structures, such as those presented above, from simple metal ions
and organic links because ions hold little directional information.
This relative lack of directionality often results in ﬂexibility around
the metal ion, a multiplicity of possible structures and a general lack
of control—as exempliﬁed by frameworks based on Cu ions and
bipyridine and related links13,36–42. We have focused on using the
carboxylate functionality to chelate metal ions and lock them into
rigid and thus directional metal–oxygen–carbon clusters, with the
points of extension (in this example, carboxylate C atoms) deﬁning
geometrical shapes referred to as secondary building units (SBUs)26.
The successful design of rigid frameworks based on such SBUs was
demonstrated for the ﬁrst time in MOF-2 (see ref. 43 and below)
and MOF-544. The design principles employed for MOF-5 will be
discussed here to show that SBUs have intrinsic geometric proper-
ties that facilitate network design and help us to address the issues of
network synthesis and robustness.
In MOF-5 (Fig. 1a), Zn4O(CO2)6 units containing four ZnO4
tetrahedra with a common vertex and six carboxylate C atoms that
deﬁne an octahedral SBU are joined together by benzene links. This
leads to a cubic network in which the vertices are the octahedral
SBUs and the edges are the benzene struts. In practice, this
compound was prepared from Zn(II) and BDC acid under con-
ditions pre-determined to yield the octahedral SBU in situ. Because
the SBU and benzene links are relatively large and rigid entities, the
structure produced has exceptional porosity (indicated by its sorp-
tion), and stability (indicated by thermal analysis and single crystal
X-ray diffraction studies on the completely evacuated frame-
work8,44).
The exceptional stability of MOF-5 can be understood by
comparing its basic network, composed of single atom vertices
(Fig. 1b), with the actual structure of MOF-5, which has cationic
clusters at those vertices (Fig. 1a). The basic network has no
resistance to shear if the links are considered to be universal joints.
However, in the actual MOF-5 structure, the cationic clusters have
a truncated tetrahedral envelope (Fig. 1c), and the rigidly planar
O2C-C6H4-CO2 linkers have a planar slat envelope. The linkage of
these two groups produces an inherently rigid structure held
together by mutually perpendicular hinges.
This approach, based on the concept of SBUs, has been useful in
rationalizing the topologies of MOF structures26, and more impor-
tantly, it has allowed the synthesis and use of a large number of
inorganic and organic SBUs with varying geometries (Fig. 2)26,43–52.
In many of these cases, identifying the reaction conditions that
produce an SBU with a speciﬁc geometry in situ means that the
addition of a rigid organic SBU will result in the formation of a pre-
determined network. In other words, with this strategy it is now
possible to control the overall coordination number of the inorganic
and organic SBUs, and therefore the need to identify the networks
that are expected to form from different geometric shapes becomes
particularly acute.
Possible framework topologies
Which framework topology can be expected to form is of critical
importance because there are a large number of possible structures
for each geometrical shape. For example, more than 100 different
topologies (in addition to that of diamond)53 are possible for linking
tetrahedral building blocks together into structures with just one
kind of vertex (that is, all vertices related by symmetry), and the
would-be designer must ﬁnd some criteria for deciding which will
be selected.
We have recently argued that in general only a small number of
simple, high-symmetry structures will be of overriding general
importance, and they would be expected to form most commonly54.
We call these default structures, in that they would be expected to
form if the assembly reaction involved simple building blocks,
especially single atoms (ions) joined by ﬂexible linkers. More
complicated structures can be targeted by judicious use of appro-
priately shaped SBUs and linkers (we give examples below). A list
of some default structures54 and some criteria for their classiﬁ-
cation55–60 are given in Box 2.
We have undertaken a systematic survey59 of structures with the
goal of design in mind. There are just six three-periodic structures
with one kind of vertex, edge and ring—we call these regular and
quasi-regular. The next most regular are those with just one kind of
link. Their enumeration is mostly straightforward and—together

with the regular structures—they are the most common structures
used in reticular chemistry, because one almost always attempts a
synthesis with just one kind of linker. As an illustration, we48 have
enumerated the nine principal ways in which square SBUs can be
joined by equal linkers to form polyhedra, rods, layers or three-
dimensional nets. In the next section we show how this enumeration
allows particular linked-square structures of each different dimen-
sionality to be successfully targeted for synthesis using appropriately
shaped linkers.
Design and synthesis of pre-determined frameworks
As we noted above, metal-containing (cationic) SBUs are not
isolatable entities, and so it has been essential to establish the
exact chemical conditions that will yield a speciﬁc SBU in situ.
On the other hand, organic (anionic) SBUs are pre-assembled
using the considerable sophistication of organic synthetic
methods10—see Box 1 and Fig. 2 for examples. For a given
cationic SBU the geometry of the organic unit plays an
important role in directing the structure. This is illustrated
(Fig. 3) for four structures41,61–63 of different dimensionality
(periodicity—0-D refers to an object within only point sym-
metries): a truncated cuboctahedron (0D), a linear rod (1D) the
square grid (2D), and the NbO network (3D) based on linkage
of paddle-wheel clusters by ditopic linkers. The dihedral angle
between the paddle wheels (square SBUs) plays a crucial role in
determining which one of these structures will be produced.
The reaction conditions that would yield the paddle-wheel
clusters were used in the presence of the appropriate link, to
give the desired structure—which is in each case the only
possible structure given identical linkers of the shape indicated.

of four SBUs (green triangles). The carboxylate carbons of this unit are at the vertices of
a trigonal prism.

This approach can be used in linking together other SBU shapes.
For example, the PtS net is the default structure for linking squares
(Pt) and tetrahedra (S). Assembly of the paddle wheel with ATC and
ATB (tetrahedral SBUs) yields MOF-1151 and MOF-3626, which are
indeed based on the PtS net. There are only two ways of linking
square and triangular SBUs—these are the nets named for Pt3O4 and
‘twisted boracite’—and they might both be considered default
structures54 (Box 2). Again, linking a copper-based paddle wheel
with triangular SBUs, either BTB or BTC, gives MOF-1449 with the
Pt3O4 topology and HKUST-164 with the twisted boracite topology,
respectively. Examination of the parent nets shows that the simpler
Pt3O4 net requires the more ﬂexible BTB links.
The regular (and hence default) structure for linking triangles is
the chiral 3D Si network in SrSi2, which has been a target of reticular
synthesis45,65. Interestingly, it is composed of achiral triangular
vertices, which twist with respect to adjacent like vertices by a
dihedral angle of 70.58 to make an overall chiral arrangement. This
topology was assembled from BTC and Zn(II) under conditions
that give a propeller-shaped binuclear M2(CO2)3 SBU (Fig. 2a)45.
Here, three carboxylate C atoms of the SBU are twisted with respect
to the C atoms on the benzene ring to give chiral crystals although
the bulk material is racemic. Recently, it has been demonstrated that
an enantiopure MOF can be prepared from a derivative D-tartaric
acid (D-PTT) and Zn(II) to give a triangular SBU, which formed a
hexagonal layered network66 that was functionalized with pyridine
units to allow the pores to be used for chiral catalysis.
It is worth noting that exquisite control over the outcome of
reticular synthesis has also been developed using site-blocked
metal complexes that express angular information. For example,
cis-PDA provides 908 binding angles such that with linear
ditopic organic links such as BPY67, the nitrate ligands are
displaced by BPY, leading to molecular squares. On the basis
of this approach other metal complexes of various binding
angles and a variety of branching and bent organic links have
been used in the design of other polygons, platonic and archime-
dean polyhedra61,68–71.
Box 2
Framework topologies
The topology underlying periodic structures is that of a periodic net.
Crystal chemists, particularly Wells15, have laboured to enumerate,
describe and classify such nets. We58 ﬁnd the approach based on tiling
to be particularly fruitful55,56. The tiles are generalized polyhedra (cages)
which generate the entire structure when packed together. For each
periodic net there is a unique ‘natural’ tiling58; examples are shown in
Fig. 5. The adamantane unit with ten vertices is the natural tile of the
diamond net. Its four faces are six-membered rings, which we
symbolize as [64]. The natural tiling of the lonsdaleite net has equal
numbers of two tiles that are [63] and [65] (Fig. 5).
To classify nets we make use of the transitivity of the structure57. If
there are p kinds of vertex, q kinds of edge (link), r kinds of ring (faces
of tiles) and s kinds of tile, the transitivity is pqrs. It turns out58 that the
ﬁve structures whose natural tilings have transitivity 1111 have
coordination ﬁgures that are regular polygons or polyhedra and we
call them ‘regular’ (see Table 1). Their importance in reticular
synthesis is comparable to that of the ﬁve platonic solids in other
areas of chemistry. Structures 1112 are called ‘quasiregular’ and
structures 11rs are ‘semiregular’. These are the structures that are
most likely to form with one kind of SBU joined by one kind of link.
They can be enumerated fairly easily and there are only about twenty
of them (the exact number depends on some subtle details of what
we consider to be allowable structures). There are another twenty or
so structures with two vertices and one edge. Structures with just one
kind of edge (edge transitive) are the most reasonable targets of
designed reticular synthesis, and thus the most important from that
point of view. Even these approximately 50 structures can quickly be
reduced to a smaller number. For example, there are seven edge-
transitive nets with tetrahedral vertices (examples are given in Table
1) but the diamond net is the most regular, and thus the default net for
tetrahedral coordination.
Of course less regular nets can be forced by low-symmetry SBUs.
For example, 5-coordinated SBUs cannot be linked by just one kind
(that is, symmetry equivalent) of link. Two simple examples are given in
Table 1. There is only one 3-coordinated 3D net with symmetry that
requires the coordination ﬁgure to be an equilateral triangle (that of
SrSi2—see Table 1). The use of 3-coordinated SBUs with a T or Y shape
can accordingly lead to a lower-symmetry net such as that of Si in ThSi2
(also listed). The formation of the rutile net instead of the more
symmetrical pyrite net in (6,3)-coordinated structures is often
ascribable to similar causes.

A new class of porous materials
We have just argued that the rigidity and directionality of SBUs
provide a means for the logical synthesis of a wide variety of
frameworks. An important aspect of this approach is that the
large sizes of SBUs inevitably lead to there being spaces within
these structures where solvent and/or counter-ion guests reside. In
many cases, such solids are interchangeably referred to as “porous”
and “open-framework”, without deﬁnitive proof of porosity72. We
prefer to categorize them according to the mobility of the species
occupying their cavities. It is inaccurate to use the term ‘open
framework’ to refer to any low-density or large-scale structure,
because ‘open’ implies allowing passage. We note that in many cases
this property is absent (or at least undetermined in the structure in
question) because passage is hindered by solvent molecules that
form strong interactions with the framework; as a result, such
solvent molecules are necessary to maintain the crystal architecture.
Thus we consider that ‘porous’ implies having pores, and pores
are, in the Oxford English Dictionary deﬁnition, a “minute…
opening… through which ﬂuids or gases can pass”. In addition,
demonstration of porosity through gas sorption isotherms is
necessary to prove permanent porosity. Indeed, we ﬁnd that
MOFs having structures based on inorganic SBUs are exceptionally
porous with pore diameters and volumes which exceed those of the
most porous and useful zeolites as shown in Fig. 473–84.
Two important attributes of porous MOFs account for their
structural stability and high porosity. First, they are essentially
scaffoldings with all or most atoms on internal surfaces, which
lead to the highest known surface areas (2,900 m2 g21) and pore
volumes (1–2 cm3 g21). In other porous solids such as zeolites and
molecular sieves the interior of the pores is largely composed of
walls leading to relatively lower speciﬁc capacity for sorption.
Second, in contrast to frameworks of the metal bipyridine type,
which are known to collapse upon removal of guests, MOFs
constructed with oxide SBUs are far more robust, owing to the
Figure 3 The control of dimensionality of linked paddle-wheel units by use of precise
linker geometry. Shown are fragments of the assembled structures of MOP-161 (a),

presence of strong metal–oxygen bonds. For example, in MOF-5
each link to an octahedral SBU involves two Zn–O bonds with
energy of 360 kJ mol21 per pair (based on the heat of formation of
ZnO)85 comparable to the C–C bond energy of 358 kJ mol21 in
diamond. The corresponding energy for two Cu–O bonds (as in
linked paddle wheels) is 372 kJ mol21. In contrast, we estimate from
the heats of formation of ammoniates such as CuCl·3NH3 and
CuCl2·2NH3 that the energy of the Cu(I)–N coordination bond is
about 55 kJ mol21 and the Cu(II)–N bond is about 90 kJ mol21:
very much weaker, and indeed the weak link in metal-bipyridine
type frameworks.
Frameworks with adjustable metrics and properties
An important step forward has been the use of expanded links such
as ECN which can be linked into MOF structures in which the pores
can be functionalized by modifying R86, and expanded by lengthen-
ing L (see Box 1). When assembled with Ag(I) this link gives
networks based on the Si network in ThSi2 (Box 2). It is interesting
to note that the unfunctionalized (R ¼ H) link also gives the same
network. This ﬁnding indicates that the presence of functional
groups (R) does not alter the course of reticulation. In other
words, all frameworks produced by this method are isoreticular
(having the same network topology). These compounds have not
been shown to have permanent porosity or rigid frameworks, which
is not surprising as they are not based on vertices of clusters (SBUs),
but rather on single Ag ion vertices, which do not provide for the
prerequisite rigidity.
On the other hand, frameworks isoreticular with MOF-5 have
been synthesized with functionalized structures and shown to have
permanent porosity. Employing each of the links: o-Br-BDC, R3-
BDC, R4-BDC, R5-BDC, R6-BDC, R7-BDC, 2,6-NDC, BPDC,
HPDC, PDC and TPDC instead of BDC yielded IRMOF-2 to
IRMOF-16, including the non-interpenetrating structures of
BPDC, HPDC, PDC and TPDC. Each member of the IRMOF
series has been isolated and characterized by single-crystal X-ray
diffraction studies82. The key element in synthesizing this series was
to use the acid form of the link under reaction conditions known to
form the octahedral SBU. In this series, the per cent free volume in
crystals varies in small increments (1 to 5%) starting from 55.8%
(R5-BDC) to an exceptional 91.1% (TPDC).
It is worth noting that the lowest per cent free volume obtained in
this series exceeds that found in some of the most open zeolites (Fig.
4) in which the free space is 45–50% of the crystal volume. In fact,
the fraction of free space in crystals of the most expanded member
(TPDC) of this series has only been achievable in non-crystalline
porous systems such as SiO2 xerogels and aerogels87. Furthermore,
the calculated crystal densities (in the absence of guests) of these
materials also vary in small increments (around 0.1) in the range
1.00 g cm23 (R5-BDC) to 0.21 g cm23 (TPDC) having densities,
which are the lowest reported for any crystalline material. In
comparison, the density of Li metal is 0.56 g cm23. The ability to
control and incrementally vary the metrics in this series has
important technological implications. It has already been shown
that the speciﬁc uptake of fuel gases such as methane in one member
(R6-BDC) of the series is the highest known at present and comes
close to meeting Department of Energy guidelines for use of natural
gas in mobile applications.
In cognate work an isoreticular series based on lamellar G and S
(guanidine-sulphonate) hydrogen-bonded materials has been
achieved by varying the sulphonate functionality from DS-PGBDS
(Box 1). Although these frameworks do not have permanent
porosity as in MOFs, they provide advantages for selective crystal-
lization-based separations88.
In addition to providing rigidity and structure information, SBUs
can also impart physical properties to the framework. In the
examples based on the paddle wheel and other binuclear clusters,
the axial ligands are weakly bound to the porous framework,
allowing their removal by heating or evacuation. The resulting
open metal sites act as molecular imprints and site-isolated
units51, exhibiting highly selective binding of organic molecules
and, in the case of Tb(III), luminescent behaviour that has formed a
basis for sensing small molecules74.
Although porosity is almost an inevitable outcome of the SBU
approach, other MOFs that have not been examined for their
porosity have shown other interesting properties. Acentric SBUs
can be assembled into MOFs having nonlinear optical properties, as
illustrated for PCA-189. Here, a triangular SBU is linked by PCA-1 to
give a decorated honeycomb-type framework. Similar frameworks
have been designed using paramagnetic metal ions to produce
ferromagnetic MOFs: links such as OX and OXM serve as magnetic
coupling bridges in 2D ferromagnetic frameworks90,91. Recently, 3D
magnetic frameworks have also been targeted using Mn(II), Fe(II),
Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II) and Cr(III) metal ions and CN92, C(CN)3
93
and Re6S8(CN)6
94 links to produce rutile and Prussian-blue type
solids. A mixed-valence conductive framework based on BDC has
been constructed from V(III/IV)80, in which inﬁnite vanadium
oxide SBUs lead to the same SrAl2 topology found for MOF-6995.
Logic of synthesis by design
On the conceptual level, the underlying process for logical synthesis
of MOFs starts with the designer choosing a speciﬁc target network,
which is then deconstructed into its component geometric units.
Molecular building blocks with the same geometry as those of the
units are then assembled into a MOF structure that has the target
network topology. The value of this approach is not limited to its
utility in accessing a vast number of materials with predetermined
structures: it also allows the designer to develop a deconstruction
strategy for a target network. Such a deconstruction strategy
becomes indispensable when designing non-default networks.
This aspect is also addressed by reticular synthesis as shown in
Fig. 5 for two basic networks; diamond and lonsdaleite (‘hexagonal
diamond’)54,60.

The designer of a material having these topologies would recog-
nize that the simplest deconstruction scheme yields tetrahedral
building blocks in both cases. Thus the assembly of molecules
with tetrahedral shape would be expected to yield at least one of
these two possible arrangements. However, in practice most struc-
tures (discussed above) obtained from simple tetrahedral building
blocks are based on the cubic diamond network (Fig. 5a), which
corresponds to the simplest, highest-symmetry structure (it is the
only regular tetrahedral net) and unless the molecular building blocks
contain information to the contrary, it is the default reticulation.
Reticulations based on the lonsdaleite topology are rare.
We therefore investigated how reticular synthesis could be used to
access non-default structures such as lonsdaleite. It is necessary to
deconstruct its structure into more elaborate units that express
structural features unique to its structure. Although the two
structures are composed of fused six-membered rings, all such
rings in diamond have the ‘chair’ conformation, whereas those in
the hexagonal form assume both chair and ‘boat’ conformations as
illustrated in Fig. 5. Thus it seems reasonable that to make frame-
works based on lonsdaleite, the network should be deconstructed
into units of fused chair and boat rings rather than of individual
tetrahedra. In this way, the assembly of the corresponding molecular
building blocks would yield exclusively the target network. We note
that the above discussion does not preclude the possibility of
achieving lonsdaleite from smaller units, if the structure formation
were driven by the templating effect of included guest molecules96 as
described in the next section.
This treatment can be universally applied to the design of
crystalline molecular arrays of any dimensionality. We emphasize
that the achievement of complex low-symmetry topologies by
design requires the construction of complex molecular building
blocks coded speciﬁcally for those topologies.
Complexity and non-default structures
The discussion so far has been limited to the design of frameworks
in which the geometry of the links and/or vertices largely determines
the outcome. In the formation of neutral frameworks, such as those
of metal carboxylates, the role of the solvent in default structures is
largely a space-ﬁlling one, although their function as structure-
directing agents (templates) becomes more important in the design
of networks where the building blocks have more than one possible
default structure96.
In particular, assembly of charged frameworks with counter ions
requires careful matching of the charge, size and volume of counter
ion to the charge per unit area of the target framework. This was
illustrated in the assembly of T3 and T4 indium sulphide super-
tetrahedra, whose tetrahedral symmetry leads not only to the
default diamond-like frameworks97, but also to the slightly less
symmetric structures such as that of sodalite and the boron network
in CrB4
98. Here it is important to consider both the size and volume
of the organic ammonium cations and the charge they provide per
unit area of the prospective charged framework. We expect that
similar factors must be considered to explain the formation of
sodalite, feldspar and quartz MOF networks from tetrahedral Cu(I)
and HPMO99, PRM100 and 2,2
0-bpy39, respectively. This analysis
indicates that for some target non-default networks, elaborate units
similar to those suggested for the reticular synthesis of lonsdaleite
may not be the only option for their design.
Future prospects
Even with only the structures that are based on default networks, the
immense wealth and scope of reticular chemistry has become
apparent. In particular, design of the structural skeleton coupled
with the ability to control its chemical functionalization and
adjustment of its metric dimensions present exciting prospects.
We have described here a conceptual approach to this subject, which
we believe has proved useful, and which will continue to guide the
designer.
Speciﬁc future challenges include the ability to design sophisti-
cated molecular building blocks that would act as carriers of
structural and functional information to be expressed in a speciﬁc
target material. This will be of great beneﬁt to many emerging
technologies involving molecular electronics, miniature fuel cells,
chiral catalysis and materials with hybrid properties.
