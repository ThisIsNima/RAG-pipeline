Preface
Computational ﬂuid dynamics, commonly known by the acronym ‘CFD’, continues
to have signiﬁcant expansion. There are many software packages available that
solve ﬂuid ﬂow problems; thousands of engineers are using them across a broad
range of industries and research areas. The market is growing apparently at a rate of
around 15% each year. CFD codes are accepted nowadays as design tools in many
industries and are used not only to solve problems but also to help in designing and
optimizing
various
products
and
as
a
vehicle
for
research.
While
the
user-friendliness of commercial CFD-tools has greatly increased since the ﬁrst
edition of this book appeared in 1996, for their efﬁcient and reliable application it is
still necessary that the user has a solid background in both ﬂuid mechanics and
CFD-methods. We assume that our readers are familiar with theoretical ﬂuid
mechanics, so we try to provide useful information on the other component—
computational methods for ﬂuid dynamics.
The book is based on material offered by the authors in the past in courses at
Stanford University, the University of Erlangen-Nürnberg and the Technical
University of Hamburg-Harburg, as well as in a number of short courses. It reﬂects
the authors’ experience in developing numerical methods, writing CFD codes and
using them to solve engineering and geophysical problems. Many of the codes used
in the examples, from the simple ones involving rectangular grids to the ones using
non-orthogonal grids and multigrid methods, are available to interested readers; the
information on how to access them via the Internet is given in the appendix. These
codes illustrate some of the methods described in the book; they can be extended
and adapted to the solution of many ﬂuid mechanical problems. Students should try
to modify them (e.g., to implement different boundary conditions, interpolation
schemes, differentiation and integration approximations, etc.). This is important as
one does not really know a method until she or he has programmed and/or run it.
We have learned that many researchers have used these codes in the past as the
basis for their research projects.
The ﬁnite volume method is favored in this book, although ﬁnite difference
methods are described in what we hope is sufﬁcient detail. Finite element methods
are not covered in detail as a number of books on that subject already exist.

The basic ideas of each topic are described in such a way that they can be
understood by the reader; where possible, we have avoided lengthy mathematical
analysis. Usually, a general description of an idea or method is followed by a more
detailed description (including the necessary equations) of one or two numerical
schemes representative of the better methods of the type; other possible approaches
and extensions are brieﬂy described. We have tried to emphasize common elements
of methods rather than their differences and to provide the basis upon which
variants can be built.
We have placed considerable emphasis on the need to estimate numerical errors;
almost all examples in this book are accompanied with error analysis. Although it is
possible for a qualitatively incorrect solution of a problem to look reasonable (it
may even be a good solution of another problem), the consequences of accepting it
may be severe. On the other hand, sometimes a solution of a relatively low accuracy
can be of value if treated with care. Industrial users of commercial codes need to
learn to judge the quality of the results before believing them. Likewise, researchers
have the same challenge. We hope that this book will contribute to the awareness
that numerical solutions are always approximate and need to be properly assessed.
We have tried to cover a cross-section of modern approaches, including arbitrary
polyhedral and overlapping grids, multigrid methods and parallel computing,
methods for moving grids and free surface ﬂows, direct and large-eddy simulation
of turbulence, etc. Obviously, we could not cover all these topics in detail, but we
hope that the information contained herein will provide the reader with a useful
general knowledge of the subject; those interested in a more detailed study of a
particular topic will ﬁnd recommendations for further reading.
The long time between the previous and the current edition of this book was
caused by the sudden passing of Joel H. Ferziger in 2004. Although the remaining
co-author of the previous edition found an excellent partner for continuing the
project in Bob Street, for various reasons (but mostly the lack of time), it took a
while before this new edition was ﬁnished. The new co-author has brought a new
expertise, and the time passed also required that most chapters be signiﬁcantly
revised. Notably, the former Chap. 7 dealing with methods for solving the
Navier-Stokes equations has been completely re-written and broken-up into two
chapters. Fractional-step methods, which are widely used for large-eddy simula-
tions, have been described in more detail and a new, implicit version has been
derived. New codes based on the fractional-step method have been added to the set
which can be downloaded by readers from the web-site created specially for that
purpose
(www.cfd-peric.de).
Most
examples
in
later
chapters
have
been
re-computed using commercial software; the simulation ﬁles for these examples
with some instructions can also be downloaded from the above web-site.
While we have invested every effort to avoid typing, spelling, and other errors,
no doubt some remain to be found by readers. We will appreciate your notifying us
of any mistakes you might ﬁnd, as well as your comments and suggestions for
improvement of future editions of the book. For that purpose, the authors’ electronic
mail addresses are given below. Corrections, as well as additional extended reports
on some of the examples will become available for download at the above web-site.

We also hope that colleagues whose work has not been referenced will forgive us,
because any omissions are unintentional.
We have to thank all our present and former students, colleagues, and friends,
who helped us in one way or another to ﬁnish this work; the complete list of names
is too long to present here. Names that we cannot avoid mentioning include (in
alphabetic order) Drs. Steven Armﬁeld, David Briggs, Fotini (Tina) Katapodes
Chow, Ismet Demirdžić, Gene Golub, Sylvain Lardeau, Željko Lilek, Samir
Muzaferija, Joseph Oliger, Eberhard Schreck, Volker Seidl, and Kishan Shah. The
help provided by those people who created and made available TEX, LATEX, Linux,
Xﬁg, Gnuplot, and other tools which made our job easier is also greatly appreciated.
Special thanks to Rafael Ritterbusch who provided the ﬂuid-structure interaction
example in Chap. 13.
Our families gave us a tremendous support during this endeavor; our special
thanks go to Eva Ferziger, Anna James, Robinson and Kerstin Perić and Norma
Street.
The initial collaboration between geographically distant colleagues was made
possible by grants and fellowships from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation
(to JHF) and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German National Research
Foundation, to MP). Without their support, this work would never have come into
existence and we cannot express sufﬁcient thanks to them. One of the authors
(MP) is especially indebted to the late Peter S. MacDonald, former president of
CD-adapco, for his support, and to managers at Siemens (Jean-Claude Ercollanely,
Deryl Sneider, and Sven Enger), who provided both support and the software
Simcenter STAR-CCM+ to create examples in Chaps. 9–131. RLS is deeply
appreciative of the opportunity to contribute to the continuation of the work of his
great friend and research colleague, Joel Ferziger.
