Metal Additive Manufacturing: A Review
William E. Frazier
(Submitted February 24, 2014; published online April 8, 2014)
This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of an important, rapidly emerging, manufacturing technology that is
alternatively called additive manufacturing (AM), direct digital manufacturing, free form fabrication, or
3D printing, etc. A broad contextual overview of metallic AM is provided. AM has the potential to revo-
lutionize the global parts manufacturing and logistics landscape. It enables distributed manufacturing and
the productions of parts-on-demand while offering the potential to reduce cost, energy consumption, and
carbon footprint. This paper explores the material science, processes, and business consideration associated
with achieving these performance gains. It is concluded that a paradigm shift is required in order to fully
exploit AM potential.

1. Introduction
ASTM has deﬁned additive manufacturing (AM) as ‘‘a
process of joining materials to make objects from 3D model
data, usually layer upon layer, as opposed to subtractive
manufacturing methodologies. Synonyms: additive fabrication,
additive processes, additive techniques, additive layer manu-
facturing, layer manufacturing, and freeform fabrication’’
(Ref 1). This deﬁnition is broadly applicable to all classes of
materials including metals, ceramics, polymers, composites,
and biological systems. While AM has been around as a means
of processing materials for, arguably, over two decades, it has
only recently begun to emerge as an important commercial
manufacturing technology.
In 2009, Bourell et al. (Ref 2) published a roadmap for AM
based on a workshop of 65 key people in AM. Their report
explored important facets of the AM including:
•
Design
•
Process modeling and control
•
Materials, processes, and machines
•
Biomedical applications
•
Energy and sustainability applications
In 2010, Frazier (Ref 3) published the results of a Navy
workshop entitled ‘‘direct digital manufacturing (DDM) of
metallic components: affordable, durable, and structurally
efﬁcient aircraft.’’ A vision of parts on demand when and
where they are needed was articulated. Achieving the vision
state would enhance operational readiness, reduce energy
consumption, and reduce the total ownership cost of naval
aircraft through the use of AM. Speciﬁc technical challenges
were identiﬁed to address the quantitative objectives in the
areas of (i) innovative structural design, (ii) qualiﬁcation and
certiﬁcation, (iii) maintenance and repair, and (iv) DDM
science and technology. Top level ﬁndings include
•
High priority should be given to developing integrated
in-process, sensing, monitoring, and controls. Machine-
to-machine variability must be understood and controlled.

•
Alternatives to conventional qualiﬁcation methods must
be found; these are likely based upon validated models,
probabilistic methods, and part similarities. Part-by-part
certiﬁcation is costly, time consuming, and antithetical to
achieving the Navys vision of producing and using AM
parts on demand.
•
Priority should be given to the development of integrated
structural and materials design tools. This is needed to
accelerate the adoption of AM by the aircraft design com-
munity and to promote new innovative structural designs
needed to save energy and weight.
•
Underline science of DDM needs to be developed. Phys-
ics-based models are needed relating microstructure, prop-
erties, and performance. New alloys must be developed to
optimize properties. An understanding of how to control
fatigue properties and reduce surface roughness, must be
developed.
Hederick (Ref 4) published a review of AM of metals in 2011.
Presented is a nice summary of the various AM technologies
and the dominate AM equipment manufacturers. AM equip-
ment was broadly divided into powder bed systems, laser
powder injection systems, and free form fabrication (FFF)
systems. Some of the major ﬁndings of the report include:
•
Materials processed using AM experience complex ther-
mal processing cycles. There is a need to better under-
stand the link between microstructure, processing, and
properties for AM fabricated parts, as well as developing
an AM materials database. He reports that there has been
a lot of work on Ti-6Al-4V, but not so much on other
alloys.
•
There is a need reduce the variance in properties and qual-
ity from machine-to-machine across materials and machine
types. Therefore, closed-loop feedback control and sensing
systems with intelligent feed forward capability needs to
be developed. Further, the ruggedization of AM equip-
ment is needed.
•
AM can be applied to the manufacturing of parts that can-
not be made with standard machining practices. This pos-
sibility enables novel design methodologies.
NIST held a workshop in December of 2012 and recently
published the results ‘‘Measurement Science Roadmap for
Metal-Based Additive Manufacturing’’ (Ref 5). Important
technology challenges were identiﬁed in the areas (i) AM
materials, (ii) AM process and equipment, (iii) AM qualiﬁca-
tion and certiﬁcation, and (iv) AM modeling and simulation.
The technology development opportunities identiﬁed include:
•
Robust in situ process monitoring techniques including
sensors for measuring and monitoring AM processes and
products.
•
A metals design allowable and performance capability
database
•
A shared 3rd party database
•
An expert system for AM design
•
Validated physics and properties-based models.
Common to the aforementioned work is the recognition that
AM is a transformative technology. AM will impact component
design, cost, and product delivery; it will affect global business
models and logistics; it should enable increased energy
efﬁciency and lower environmental impact.
Standardization of AM processes is an important step in the
advancement of metals AM and is currently on-going. In 2009,
the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) F42
Committee on AM Technologies was created to guide the
development of international standards in AM. ASTM F2924
Speciﬁcation for AM Titanium-6 Aluminum-4 Vanadium with
Powder Bed Fusion was approved in 2012. Other important
standardizations were created that ultimately assist the advance-
ment of AM including, ASTM F2792 standardized AM
terminology (2009) and ASTM F2915 Speciﬁcation for AM
File Format (2011). Standardization of the ﬁle formats to
additive manufacturing ﬁle (AMF) format allows designs to be
transferred between different hardware and software systems
and was developed to support full-color multi-material geom-
etries with microstructure and material gradients.
The 2009 RapidTech paper by Bourell et al. (Ref 2)
identiﬁed the need for a National test bed Center with experts
that would facilitate the leveraging of equipment and human
resources. In August 2012, the National Additive Manufactur-
ing Innovation Institute, now called America Makes, was
formed by President Obama as part of the National Network for
Manufacturing
Innovation.
Based
in
Youngstown,
Ohio,
NAMII serves as a national resource in expertise for AM.
NAMIIs mission is to ‘‘accelerate AM technologies to the U.S.
manufacturing sector and increase domestic manufacturing
competitiveness by fostering a highly collaborative infrastruc-
ture for the open exchange of AM information and research;
facilitating the development, evaluation, and deployment of
efﬁcient and ﬂexible AM technologies; and educating students
and training workers in AM technologies to create an adaptive,
leading workforce.’’[NAMII website] NAMII has recently
funded six AM projects, three on metals, and three on
polymers.
2. Metallic Additive Manufacturing Systems
AM system may be classiﬁed/categorized in terms of the
material feed stock, energy source, build volume, etc. Table 1 is
a selected list of equipment manufactures and their equipment.
In this table, manufacturing systems are divided into three
broad categories (although there are many more): (i) powder
bed systems, (ii) powder feed systems, and (iii) wire feed
systems. The energy source (electron beam, laser, arc, etc.) for
these systems is also provided.
2.1 Powder Bed Systems
All the powder bed systems are manufactured by companies
located outside the United States. In general, the build volumes
of these units are less than 0.03 m3. ARCAM, a Swedish
company, manufactures the only powder bed electron beam
system, the ARCAM A2.
Figure 1 is a schematic of a generic powder bed system. A
powder bed is created by raking powder across the work area.
The energy source (electron beam or laser beam) is pro-
grammed to deliver energy to the surface of the bed melting or
sintering the powder into the desired shape. Additional powder
is raked across the work area, and the process is repeated to
create a solid three dimensional component. The advantages of

this system include its ability to produce high resolution
features, internal passages, and maintain dimensional control.
2.2 Powder Feed Systems
A generic illustration of AM powder feed systems is shown
in Fig. 2. The build volumes of these systems are generally
larger (e.g., >1.2 m3 for the Optomec LENS 850-R unit).
Further, the powder feed systems lend themselves more readily
to build volume scale up than do the powder bed units. In these
systems, powders are conveyed through a nozzle onto the build
surface. A laser is used to melt a monolayer or more of the
powder into the shape desired. This process is repeated to create
a solid three dimensional component. There are two dominate
types of systems in the market. 1. The work piece remains
stationary, and deposition head moves. 2. The deposition head
remains stationary, and the work piece is moved. The
advantages of this type of system include its larger build
volume and its ability to be used to refurbish worn or damaged
components.
2.3 Wire Feed Systems
A schematic of a wire feed unit is shown in Fig. 3. The feed
stock is wire, and the energy source for these units can include
electron beam, laser beam, and plasma arc. Initially, a single
bead of material is deposited and upon subsequent passes is
built upon to develop a three dimensional structure. In general,
wire feed systems are well suited for high deposition rate
processing and have large build volumes; however, the

fabricated product usually requires more extensive machining
than the powder bed or powder fed systems do.
In summary, there are a large number of diverse AM pieces
of equipment commercially available. These may be broadly
characterized as powder bed, powder fed, and wire fed systems.
There are distinct advantages to each type of system dependent
upon the intended applications, e.g., repair and refurbishment,
small part fabrication, large part fabrication.
3. Technology Challenges
3.1 Process Controls, Sensors and Models
In 2012, the Institute for Defense Analysis (Science and
Technology Policy Institute) reported on status and opportuni-
ties of AM (Ref 6). A key ﬁnding was that additional R&D
resources need to be applied to technical challenges such as
process control and modeling. There is a need for real-time,
closed-loop process controls and sensor in order to ensure
quality, consistency, and reproducibility across AM machines
(Ref 3, 6). Since the properties of AM materials are tied to the
immediate past processing history (e.g., build temperature, part
geometry), sensors are being developed to measure melt pool
size and shape as well as melt pool and build temperatures.
These concepts are being explored under Navy SBIR projects
(Ref 7). These data in combination with predictive algorithms
are needed in order to adjust and control process parameters in
real time to ensure quality, consistency, and reliability.
3.2 Metallurgy
To date, there have been only a limited number of commercial
alloys used in AM. Some of these are presented in Table 2. As the
AM ﬁeld matures, it is clear to this author that new alloys will need
to be developed in order to exploit the advantages of AM. Ti-6Al-
4V has been by far the most extensively investigated. This can be
attributed to the strong business case that can be developed for
complex, low production volume titanium parts.

AM is a layer by layer manufacturing process. A single layer
of metal is ‘‘cast’’ upon a previous layer resulting in a complex,
time dependent temperature proﬁles within the part being
fabricated. The result is that the alloy may experience repeated
solid state and liquid-solid phase transformations. Figure 4 is a
notional thermal proﬁle for a single layer AM processed
Ti-6Al-4V (Ref 8, 9). In this graph, the temperature of a single
layer is mapped showing that this layer experienced two liquid-
solid transformation and two alpha-beta transformations. These
proﬁles are dependent upon a number of variables including the
AM equipment, the time between passes, and the size of the
part being fabricated.
In general, AM is a relatively rapid solidiﬁcation process.
Zheng et al. (Ref 10-12) report cooling rates for the LENS
process to be between 103 and 104 K/s. Vilaro et al. (Ref 10)
reported cooling rates of 104 K/s for SLM. Zheng et al. (Ref 12)
used dendrite arm spacing to establish the cooling rate of LENS
processed 316L. Further, the heat ﬂow in AM processes is
directional frequently resulting in columnar microstructures.
Kobryn and Semiatin developed a solidiﬁcation map for
Ti-6Al-4V using Nd:YAG laser and a CO2 Laser. Using this
method, the maps of columnar, mixed, and equiaxed structures
were developed as a function of cooling rate, G(K/s), versus
solidiﬁcation rate, R(cm/s) (Ref 13).
The combined effect of rapid solidiﬁcation, directional
cooling, and phase transformations induced by repeated thermal
cycles has a profound inﬂuence on the microstructures of the
materials deposited. Rapid solidiﬁcation reduces elemental
partitioning and extends solid solubility and can result in
metastable phase formation. Directional heat extraction may
result in preferred directionality in grain growth. Repeated
thermal cycles have a possible complex set of effects, including
microstructural
banding,
i.e.,
microstructural
differences
between depositions layers (Ref 1, 14-16). For Ti-6Al-4V,
Vilaro et al. reported large columnar grains 150-lm wide;
re-melting resulted in a strong texture as a result of epitaxial
growth nucleating on columnar grain sites. A strong anisotropy
in fracture behavior was also noted and attributed to manufac-
turing defects. Some of the typical defects observed in the SLM
process were micro-porosity and lack of fusion. The micro-
porosity (10-50 lm at less than 1 vol.%) was reported and
attributed to gas entrapment (Ref 11) as was the alpha prime
phase due to rapid cooling.
Macro-graphic images of additive manufacture Ti-6Al-4V
are presented in Fig. 5. Figure 5(a) and (b) is materials
produced by ARL Penn States laser beam, powder blown
system. Figure 5(c) is produced by NASAs electron beam,
wire fed system. The typically observed columnar grains are
seen growing in the z-direction (i.e., perpendicular to the build
plane) and in the direction of heat extraction. Although
columnar grain growth is observed in materials produced by
both systems, it is less prominent in the single pass laser

system. Optical micrographs of these same materials are
presented in Fig. 6 and 7. In general, the microstructure of
the laser powder blown materials appears ﬁner in structure than
those produced by the wire fed system. This is attributed to the
larger melt pool (as likely slower cooling rates) associated with
the wire fed system.
Wang et al. reported that fatigue cracks initiating at pores
close to the surface for WAAM processed Ti-6Al-4V. Porosity
is attributed to the absorption of N, O, and H in the molten weld
pool; this then nucleates at the solid-liquid interface during
solidiﬁcation. The fatigue life of most of the specimens
exceeded the baseline; however, a small number failed at a
very early stage of testing (Ref 17).
In summary, AM alloys have a complex thermal history
involving directional heat extraction, and repeated melting and
rapid solidiﬁcation. Typically, AM fabricated alloys also
experience repeated solid state phase transformations. These
factors introduce complexities not typically found in conven-
tional processes.
3.3 Mechanical Properties
The focus of this section is on the mechanical properties of
AM processed Ti-6Al-4V and IN 625 and IN 718.
3.4 Ti-6Al-4V
The AMS 4999 speciﬁcation lists the minimum mechanical
properties for laser AM produced Annealed Ti-6Al-4V in
Table 3 (Ref 18). Where X is in the direction of deposition; Y is
transverse to the X direction and in the plane of deposition; Z is
the direct normal to the plane of deposition. The speciﬁcation
calls for post AM thermal processing, viz., HIP or thermal
anneal treatment. The HIP cycle is nominally 100 MPa and
926 C for 2-4 h and furnace cooled below 427 C. The
thermal anneal is nominally 913 C for 2-4 h and furnace
cooled below 427 C. It is worth noting that both the HIP
temperature and the thermal anneal temperatures are within the
a-b phase ﬁeld close to the b-transus temperature of 1000 C.
The static properties of AM processed Ti-6Al-4V reported
are comparable to wrought product form (Ref 19-21). Some
values reported for M280 and ARCAM processed materials are
presented in Table 4 (Ref 19).
It is observed that the yield and ultimate tensile strengths of
the AM process alloys exceed the typical value of wrought
Ti-6Al-4V. However, it may also be noted that the ductility is
slightly lower than that of the wrought alloy, and there is
anisotropy associated with the build direction. Further, there is
a slight anisotropy in yield strength and ultimate tensile
strength associated with the build directions.
For wire and arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) fabri-
cated Ti-6Al-4V, a larger anisotropy was observed in Table 5
(Ref 9). Tensile properties in the build direction are observed to
be lower than in the X-Y plane of build. Wang et al. observed
that the mean fatigue life was slightly greater than that of forged
Ti-6Al-4V.
3.5 Nickel Superalloys
Microstructure and mechanical properties of ARCAM (EBM)
produced IN 625 are reported in Table 6 (Ref 14). Samples were
HIPed at 1393 K, 100 MPa for 4 h. In the as-fabricated
condition, the microstructure was found to be columnar with
grains up to 20 lm in width. Following HIP, the columnar grains
recrystallized, and the metastable c¢¢ (Ni3Nb) dissolved. They
reported that their work demonstrated unusual microstructures
and microstructural (columnar precipitate) architectures which
opened the door to microstructural design.
The static mechanical properties of EBM IN 625 are
reported in Table 6. In the as-fabricated condition, the ductility
is equivalent to that of the wrought and annealed IN 625, while
the yield strength is 9% lower. Upon HIPing, yield strength
decreases 26%, while the ductility increases by 57%.
Baufeld investigated the deposition of IN718 via shaped
metal deposition (SMD). The properties of this weld-based
tungsten inert gas welding AM process were compared to those
of laser and electron beam processes, Table 7 (Ref 22). The
microstructure of the SMD IN718 was described as columnar
with a ﬁne distribution of dendrites. The mechanical properties
of the SMD alloy may be considered superior to those of the
as-cast IN718, but inferior to those for other AM processes. It is
noteworthy that the tensile strength and elongation for all the
AM processed materials exceeded that of the as-cast.

(Ref 20). The porosity in the as-fabricated specimens was
report to be less than 50 lm in diameter and was attributed to
argon gas entrapment. HIP processing eliminated the residual
porosity and enhances properties. Fatigue strength of the HIPed
alloy in the Z orientation is 24% greater than in the
as-fabricated condition. Similarly, the fatigue strength of
the HIPed alloy in the X-Y orientation is 27% greater than in
the as-fabricated condition. Fatigue strength in the X-Y
orientation is nearly 8% greater than in the Z orientation for
the as-fabricated material; in the HIPed condition, the fatigue
strength is 11% greater.
Surface ﬁnish also affects fatigue performance (Ref 23). Chan
et al. investigated the effect of surface roughness on the fatigue
life of EBM &LBM Ti-6Al-4V using an ARCAM and EOS,
respectively. They employed a three point bend test with a
maximum surface stress of 600 MPa and a stress ratio, R, of 0.1.
They found that the fatigue life of rolled Ti-6Al-4V > LBM >
EBM fabricated alloys. They correlated fatigue life to surface
ﬁnish, and from their data, Eq 1 can readily be derived
lnðfatigue lifeÞ ¼ 0:34 lnðSurface RougnessÞ þ Constant
ðEq 1Þ
Very roughly, this means as surface roughness increases from
3 to 1000 Ra, the fatigue life decreases from 105 to 104
cycles.
Greitemeir et al. (Ref 24) investigated the properties and
microstructure of Ti-6Al-4V produced using electron beam
powder bed (EBPB) and laser beam powder bed (LBPB)
techniques as well as wire fed laser beam (WFLB). They
reported that the morphology of the porosity for EBPB and
LBPB differed signiﬁcantly. The LBPB processed material
exhibited irregular-shaped pores whereas the porosity of the
EBPB produced alloys was spherical. With regard to high cycle
fatigue life, they concluded that surface defects had the most
pronounced impact on reducing high cycle fatigue life. In terms
of fatigue crack growth performance, Greitemeir et al. (Ref 24)
concluded that porosity was not the dominant factor rather it
was the alloys microstructure. Stated another way, they
concluded that HIP closure of porosity did not have a
signiﬁcant impact on fatigue crack growth.
Martukanitz and Simpson (Ref 25) reported that build rate
and feature deﬁnition are closely linked and related to surface
quality. Figure 8 illustrates the relationship between build rate,
power, and feature quality. In general, as build rate increases,
feature quality/resolution decreases. The implication is that for
fatigue critical parts fabricated using high deposition rate AM
processes, post process surface ﬁnishing may be necessary.
The surface ﬁnish is affected by the type of equipment, the
direction of build, and the process parameters used (Ref 19).
Table 9 illustrates this impact.
It can be observed that the surface roughness of the build at
right angles to the energy source (side) is 2-3 times as rough as
the surfaces parallel to the energy source (top). It may be
further noted that the DMLS systems produce surfaces
approximately twice as smooth as the EBM. Surface condition
is most important for fatigue critical parts intended for use in
their as-fabricated, net shape condition. This is especially
relevant for parts with complex internal features where surface
ﬁnishing may be impracticable.
In summary, when properly processed, the static mechanical
properties of AM metallic materials are comparable to conven-
tionally fabricated metallic components. The relatively high
cooling rates achieved reduce partitioning and favor reduced
grain sizes. However, AM fabricated materials do exhibit
microstructural and mechanical property anisotropy with the
Z-direction generally being the weakest. Dynamic properties of
AM produced alloys are dominated by defect structures, viz.,

4. Qualiﬁcation, Process Models, Sensors, and
Controls
The development of closed-loop, real-time, sensing, and
control systems is essential to the qualiﬁcation and advance-
ment of AM (Ref 2, 3). This involves the development of
coupled process-microstructural models, sensor technology,
and control methods and algorithms.
The microstructural evolution of Ti-6Al-4V has been
investigated and modeled for a variety of AM and thermal
mechanical processes (Ref 8, 26, 27). AM is a uniquely
complex process of layer by layer deposition. During this
process, the thermal history of a layer may involve multiple
re-melt and solidiﬁcation cycles as well as multiple solid state
phase transformations. The development of validated models is
needed to accurately predict the structure and properties of the
deposit.
Melt pool size and shape are features that should be
controlled in order to produce materials of consistent quality.
Beuth and Klingbeil (Ref 28) have developed process maps for
predicting melt pool size and related these properties to
deposition rate and power. By doing so, he has shown that it
is possible to maintain a constant melt pool size over a range of
deposition rates.
Lambrakos and Cooper (Ref 15, 16) identiﬁed the important
process parameters to include: (i) laser or e-beam power (power
density, focus, and effect in z-direction), (ii) powder or wire
feed rate (focus and z range of build), (iii) traverse velocity, (iv)
Hatch (x-y) spacing, and (v) z increment. Due to the lack of
thermo-physical data, they used what they called the inverse
approach. That is, basic equations of theory are augmented by
experimental data.
The qualiﬁcation of AM equipment is critical to the
adoption of AM and is a necessary prerequisite to the
certiﬁcation of structural components. Presently, there is
variability from part-to-part and from machine to machine
(Ref 3, 6). A process by which a materials technology is
qualiﬁed for use varies; however, certain elements are generally
required. Frazier et al. (Ref 29) reports that there are three basic
questions which must be addressed.
1.
Has the materials technology been developed and stan-
dardized? The materials must be produced according to a
ﬁxed process speciﬁcation.
2.
Has the materials technology been fully characterized?
Statistically substantiated mechanical property minimum
data
must
be
generated
consistent
with
MMPDS
(Ref 30). For example, the A-basis allowable requires
that 99% of the population is to equal or exceed the
reported mechanical property value with a conﬁdence le-
vel of 95%.
3.
Has the materials technology been demonstrated? The
materials technology subcomponent must be demon-
strated in a relevant operational environment.
The qualiﬁcation of AM for structurally critical applications
represents signiﬁcant challenge because of the following.
1.
AM is a rapidly evolving nascent manufacturing technol-
ogy and with a large number of diverse AM units.
2.
Standardization, i.e., freezing the process, is the ﬁrst step
in the conventional qualiﬁcation process. Freezing the
process is antithetical to AM processing. However, the
ASTM F42 Committee is working to overcome this chal-
lenge. ASTM and SAE have issued several standards on
AM addressing terminology, ﬁle format, and the process-
ing of Ti-6Al-4V (Ref 18, 31-34).
3.
There are signiﬁcant cost and time barriers to the genera-
tion of the needed mechanical property data.
The conventional mean of qualifying and certifying aircraft
components is costly (>$130 m) and lengthy (15 years)
(Ref 35). The development of a statistically substantiated
database alone can cost $8-$15m, require the testing of 5,000-
100,000 specimens, and take over 2 years. Hence, technological
alternative means of accelerated qualiﬁcation are needed (Ref
36). DARPA is pursuing this under the DARPA Open Manu-
facturing Program, the Navy is pursuing it under a DDM ACT
project, and NAMII has solicited proposal in this area (Ref 35).
5. Business Considerations
In developing a business case for the use of AM vice
conventional manufacturing methods, many factors must be
taken into account. Some of these include (i) ﬁxed cost/
nonrecurring manufacturing costs, (ii) the cost of process
qualiﬁcation and component certiﬁcation, (iii) logistical costs,
and (iv) the cost of time. Cost estimation techniques include (i)
Beam Power (kW)
Deposition Rate (kg/hr)
Feature Quality (μm)

analogy based, (ii) parametric, and (iii) engineering (Ref 37).
Further, the method of allocating cost is also relevant and
includes (i) activity-based costing, (ii) total life cycle costs, (iii)
target costs, and (iv) full costing (Ref 37-40).
The UK Technology Strategy Board reported on shaping the
national (UK) competency for AM. In 2011, AM sales were
valued at $1.9B with a sustained double digit growth. Based
upon projections, sales are expected to grow at a rate of $7.5B/
year by 2020; however, if the barriers to AM are addressed,
sales could exceed $100B/year (Ref 41). The principle barriers
to full realization of this target were identiﬁed as cost, quality,
range of materials, and size limitations. Among the areas that
were identiﬁed as needing work were (i) increase in deposition
rate by 4-109, lower material costs, in-process, closed-loop
control systems to reduce process variance, training for
designers of AM, industry standards for AM qualiﬁcation,
and materials optimized for AM.
Gnam et al. (Ref 42) examined LENS repair of IN 625 3rd
stage turbine blades at the Anniston Army Depot. They found
savings of $6,297/part or $1,444,416/year. For an AV8B Ti-
6Al-4V engine blade tip repair, Kelly (Ref 43) calculated an
81% cost saving at a value of $715 k/year. Phinazee (Ref 44)
describes the beneﬁts of using the Sciaky EBFFF process to
fabricate a typical Ti-6Al-4V airframe component. The AM
process was found to have 79% greater material utilization
efﬁciency, and the fabrication cost was reduced from $17, 430
to $9,810. Kinsella investigated the deposition of IN718 alloy
features on a forged engine case. A 30% cost savings were
realized using electron beam wire deposition as compared to
conventional fabrication methods (Ref 45). Lockheed Martin
(LM) is pursing the application of AM Ti-6Al-4V on the JSF
(Ref 46). Considerable potential cost saving was identiﬁed for
parts such as the F-35 CTOL/STOVL Flaperon Spar. Brice,
Needler, and Rosenberger quote a LM VP for global integra-
tion, ‘‘This new process offers the potential to save between 30
and 50% of the cost of machining aerospace titanium structural
components, which are some of the most expensive compo-
nents in the F-35 airframe.’’
Wide spread acceptance of AM necessarily implies that
manufactures can be proﬁtable. Factors favoring AM are listed
in Table 10.
The cost associated with manufacturing can be divided into
costs which are ﬁxed and those which are recurring. Fixed costs
include such things as tools, dies, buildings, etc. These costs
must be amortized over the number of items produced.
Recurring costs are cost such as materials, labor, etc. These
costs are more directly associated with a part being produced.
Figure 9 is a notional graph illustrating the cost of
producing parts via conventional means and AM. Total cost
is seen to be a linear function of ‘‘x’’ number of parts being
produced. The Y-intercept of the lines represents the ﬁxed cost,
while the slope is the ratio of the recurring cost of the process
divided by the recurring cost of conventional manufacturing.
The assumptions made in this illustration are (1) that the ﬁxed
costs of AM are one tenth of those of conventional manufac-
turing, and (2) the recurring costs of AM are higher by 1.59
and 29, respectively.
In conducting a business case assessment (BCA), both ﬁxed
and recurring cost must be examined. In general, conventional
manufacturing involving metal working, machining, etc. have
higher ﬁxed costs, e.g., tools, dies, and manufacturing ﬂoor
space. However, their recurring costs are typically less
expensive than AM, e.g., raw materials. This makes conven-
tional manufacturing processes more competitive for large
production lots.
As can be seen from Fig. 9, the cross-over point (point of
equivalent cost) is dependent upon the ratio of recurring cost of
AM to recurring cost of conventional manufacturing. In this
example, the breakeven point for a recurring cost ratio of 2 is
around 90, whereas it is 175 for a recurring ratio of 1.5. For a
recurring cost ratio of 1, AM costs would be lower at all
production volumes. Since the cost of raw materials (powder
and wire) is signiﬁcant recurring costs drivers for AM, there
will be continued emphasis on their cost reduction.
In summary, the business case assessment will drive the
application of AM. AM is currently favored in small production
lots in which the higher cost of AM speciﬁc raw materials is
offset by a reduction in ﬁxed costs associated with conventional
manufacturing. A value can be placed on the speed, versatility,
and adaptability of AM, because it allows for just-in-time
manufacturing. Although this type of savings may be harder to
quantify, it seems clear that if one can fabricate a critical part
(perhaps needed to keep a system operational) in days vice
weeks, AM provides a value. Further, for large organization
such as DoD, the cost of maintaining part inventory can be
costly and complicated (Ref 6). AM has the potential to reduce
the logistical footprint, cost, and energy associated with the
packaging, transport, and storage of spare parts. The impact on
the logistical supply chain has yet to be fully analyzed.

6. Environment, Energy Consumption and Carbon
Footprint
Drizo and Pegna (Ref 47) reviewed the state-of-the-art
environmental impact assessment (EIA) of rapid prototyping. A
variety of methods were examined to measure environmental
impact including life-cycle analysis (LCA), environmental
impact scoring systems (EISS), and design for environment
(DFE). They found that the scarcity of research and the rapid
evolution of this technology left a large number of unresolved
issues (Ref 47). The authors recommend a joint effort of
process control engineers, designers, and environmental spe-
cialist to assess the impact.
Morrow et al. (Ref 48) examined the environmental impact
of laser-based AM vice conventional manufacturing for the
fabrication of tool and dies. Three case studies were presented,
and quantitative estimates were generated for energy con-
sumed, and the emissions produced. It was found that laser-
based remanufacturing of tooling had the greatest potential to
reduced environmental impact and cost. Further, the authors
describe a complex set of trade-offs between economic,
environmental ramiﬁcations, and manufacturing processes.
Luo et al. (Ref 49) reported on an environmental assessment
of solid FFF. They reported that the waste stream is much less
in SFF processes that in conventional manufacturing.
Kellens et al. (Ref 50) examined the energy efﬁciencies of the
selective laser sintering (SLS) and the selective laser melting
processes (SLM). The methodology employed was Cooperative
Effort on Process Emissions in Manufacturing (CO2PE!) initia-
tive (Ref 51). The authors point out that quantitative analyses of
the environmental impact of SFF processes are very limited and
that the detailed information needed regarding energy consump-
tion, waste ﬂows, and emissions is often lacking (Ref 2). Scot
et al. (Ref 6) conﬁrmed this assessment stating, ‘‘To date, few
studies have examined the variety of environmental impacts of
AM.’’ Their analysis does a nice job in deﬁning the system-level
boundaries for which environmental in and outputs are measured.
The energy efﬁciency is the ratio of output energy content of the
product/the total energy used in fabrication. For these processes,
it was determined that the energy efﬁciency was 0.086, or 8.6% of
the total energy used goes into the part. While this is an excellent
approach at the system level, it does not provide for a holistic life
cycle assessment.
Unocic and Dupont (Ref 52) examined the efﬁciency of
LENS processes use to produce H-13 tool steel and copper
powder deposits. The measured laser energy transfer efﬁciency
ranged from 30-50%. The laser energy transfer efﬁciency is the
ratio of the energy absorbed by the work piece divided by the
energy of the heat source. Further, under optimum conditions,
they found that the maximum deposition efﬁciency was
approximately 14%.
Sreenivasan and Bourell (Ref 53) examined the SLS process
from an energy use stand point. The system investigated was
the #D Systems Vanguard. The average power consumed was
19.6 kW, and the primary sources of energy consumption were
(i) chamber heater, 36%, (ii) stepper motors, 26%, the roller
drives, 16%, and the laser, 16%. They concluded that the SLS
process was a sustainable system due to its low energy
consumption, minimal waste products, and a favorable total
energy indicator.
AM holds the potential to reduce carbon footprint through
design optimization and the reduction in the material waste
stream. The ATIKINS project concluded that an optimal design
could show a weight and material saving of almost 40% (Ref
54). Their analysis showed that for long range aircraft, reducing
the weight of an aircraft by 100 kg results in both a 2.5 m
dollars saving in fuel and a 1.3 MtCO2 savings over the
lifetime of the aircraft.
It is clear that more work needs to be done to investigate the
impact of AM on the environment. A systems approach which
spans the cradle to grave life cycle of AM fabricated
component(s) is needed to capture the true beneﬁts and
possible pitfalls of using AM. It appears that components
designed to exploit the unique weight savings characteristics of
AM hold the greatest potential to reduce environmental impact.
7. Summary and Conclusions
AM is a process of making parts from 3D model data.
Usually, the parts are fabricated layer upon layer vice
convention subtractive (e.g., machining, milling, etc.) means.
There are a large number of diverse pieces of AM equipment
commercially available, and their numbers continue to grow.
These may be broadly characterized as powder bed, powder
fed, and wire fed systems.
During fabrication, metallic AM parts/alloys experience a
complex thermal history involving directional heat extraction, and
repeated melting and rapid solidiﬁcation. Many alloys also
experience repeated solid state phase transformations. These factors
introduce complexities to the analysis of microstructural evolution
and properties not typically found in conventional processes.
In general, the static mechanical properties of AM metallic
materials are comparable to conventionally fabricated metallic
components. The relatively high cooling rates achieved in
many of the AM processes reduce partitioning and favor
reduced grain sizes. Microstructural and mechanical property
anisotropy is ubiquitous in AM with the Z-direction generally
being the weakest. Processing defects (e.g., micro-porosity and
surface ﬁnish) dominate the fatigue properties of AM produced
alloys. However, HIPed and ﬁnish machined AM alloys can
exhibit fatigue properties on parity with those of wrought
alloys.
Qualiﬁcation and certiﬁcation has been repeatedly identiﬁed
as a challenge to widespread adoption of AM structurally
critical components; the current process is too costly and takes
too long. Hence, technological alternative means of accelerated
qualiﬁcation are needed.
Ultimately, the business case assessment will determine the
success of AM. AM is currently favored in small production
lots in which the higher cost of AM speciﬁc raw materials is
offset by a reduction in ﬁxed costs associated with conventional
manufacturing. Further, there is a value to be placed on the
speed, versatility, and adaptability of AM as it allows for just-
in-time manufacturing. The economic viability of producing
large production lots of AM parts depends heavily on the
reduction of reoccurring costs, i.e., the cost of the starting
materials used in AM fabrication.
AM is projected to have a positive impact on the environ-
ment by reducing energy consumption and carbon footprint. It
is clear, however, that further work needs to be done. A systems
approach which spans the cradle to grave life cycle of AM
fabricated component(s) is needed to capture the true beneﬁts
and possible pitfalls of using AM.
