Abstract.
The present paper reviews existing knowledge
with regard to Organic Aerosol (OA) of importance for
global climate modelling and deﬁnes critical gaps needed
to reduce the involved uncertainties.
All pieces required
for the representation of OA in a global climate model are
sketched out with special attention to Secondary Organic
Aerosol (SOA): The emission estimates of primary carbona-
ceous particles and SOA precursor gases are summarized.
The up-to-date understanding of the chemical formation and
transformation of condensable organic material is outlined.
Knowledge on the hygroscopicity of OA and measurements
of optical properties of the organic aerosol constituents are
summarized. The mechanisms of interactions of OA with
clouds and dry and wet removal processes parameterisations
in global models are outlined. This information is synthe-
sized to provide a continuous analysis of the ﬂow from the
emitted material to the atmosphere up to the point of the cli-
mate impact of the produced organic aerosol. The sources of
uncertainties at each step of this process are highlighted as
areas that require further studies.

Introduction
Atmospheric aerosols can scatter or absorb solar radiation,
which modiﬁes therefore the radiative balance of the atmo-
sphere (IPCC, 2001). Black carbon heats the atmosphere by
absorption of solar radiation, whereas most organic aerosol
components cool the Earth’s atmosphere. Fine aerosols have
sizes close to wavelengths in the visible and are thus ex-
pected to have a stronger climatic impact than larger parti-
cles. In addition ﬁne aerosols are transported far from their
source regions and their climatic and environmental impact
is, therefore, delocalized compared to the emission areas.
Hydrophilic aerosols can act as cloud condensation nuclei
(CCN), and thus have an indirect climatic effect through
modiﬁcation of cloud properties (Novakov and Penner, 1993;
Novakov and Corrigan, 1996; IPCC, 2001). A number of
studies have indicated that organic aerosol plays an important
role in both the direct as well as the indirect aerosol forcing
(Liousse et al., 1996; Cooke et al., 1999; Hansen et al., 1998;
Penner et al., 1998; Lohmann et al., 2000; Jacobson, 2001;
Chung and Seinfeld, 2002). However, there is an uncertainty
of at least of a factor of 3 related to this forcing (IPCC, 2001)
that deserves further study.
Organic material signiﬁcantly contributes ∼20–50% to the
total ﬁne aerosol mass at continental mid-latitudes (Saxena
and Hildemann, 1996; Putaud et al., 2004) and as high as

90% in tropical forested areas (Andreae and Crutzen, 1997;
Talbot et al., 1988, 1990; Artaxo et al., 1988, 1990; Roberts
et al., 2001). Signiﬁcant amounts of carbonaceous aerosols
are also observed in the middle troposphere (Huebert et al.,
2004).
A substantial fraction of the organic component
of atmospheric particles consists of water-soluble, possibly
multifunctional compounds (Saxena and Hildemann, 1996;
Kavouras et al., 1998; Facchini et al., 1999a). Carbonaceous
species that exist in the aerosol phase tend to be identiﬁed ac-
cording to the manner in which they entered the particulate
phase. Organic compounds that are emitted directly in partic-
ulate form are referred to as Primary Organic Aerosol (POA).
Note that the particulate matter in which these organic com-
pounds reside may contain non-organic compounds as well.
Many gas-phase organic compounds undergo oxidation in
the gas phase to yield products, generally oxygenated, that
have sufﬁciently low vapor pressures that they will partition
themselves between the gas and aerosol phases. Such com-
pounds are often referred to as semi- or non- volatile, and
when residing in the aerosol phase, as Secondary Organic
Aerosol (SOA). Thus, in its common usage, SOA refers to
that organic component of particulate matter that transfers to
the aerosol phase from the gas phase as products of gas-phase
oxidation of parent organic species. Other classes of aerosol
organic compounds exist that do not ﬁt neatly into these two
categories.
One class is organic compounds emitted into
the atmosphere in vapor form, which subsequently condense
into the aerosol phase without undergoing gas-phase chem-
istry. Since these compounds can be identiﬁed with a par-
ticular source, it seems most appropriate that they fall into
the POA category.
Another class of compounds are gas-
phase organic species that are absorbed into cloud droplets
and subsequently end up in the aerosol phase when the cloud
droplets evaporate and leave residual aerosol. Again, the dis-
tinction can be drawn as to whether the compound was emit-
ted directly by a source or resulted from chemical process-
ing in the atmosphere, in terms of its categorization as POA
or SOA, respectively. Model studies (e.g. Pun et al., 2003;
Kanakidou et al., 2000; Tsigaridis and Kanakidou, 2003) in-
dicate that under certain circumstances the main fraction of
organic aerosol can be of secondary origin, i.e. it is chemi-
cally formed in the atmosphere (Fig. 1).
This applies also to the free troposphere where low tem-
peratures favour condensation of semi-volatile compounds
that have been chemically produced locally or elsewhere.
This highlights the importance of secondary organic aerosol
(SOA) for direct and indirect forcing.
In addition, inclu-
sion of SOA in climate models is needed since veriﬁcation
of aerosol calculations with remote sensed techniques (e.g.
satellite/sun photometers) requires a full description of all
aerosol components. In-situ measurements are often not able
to discriminate between primary organic aerosol (POA) and
SOA.
The processes that have to be considered in climate mod-
els to account for the organic aerosol (OA) and its climatic
impact comprise chemistry, physics and biology. Chemical
processes include chemical formation and transformation of
the OA by homogeneous reactions followed by condensa-
tion or/and by heterogeneous reactions on particle surfaces
or/and in clouds. Physical processes that determine OA mass
and size distributions are emissions of primary OA and SOA
precursors, followed by transport by advection, convection
and diffusion, mixing with other particles by coagulation,
evaporation and condensation of organic vapours as well as
dry and wet removal (in cloud and below cloud scavenging).
Emissions of primary organic particles and also SOA precur-
sors can occur by various sources in the boundary layer and
to a lesser extent in the free troposphere. The dry and wet

removal processes of OA depend on the water solubility and
size of the particles containing these compounds. Finally, the
simulation of the climatic impact of these aerosols will addi-
tionally require the description i) of the water uptake by the
particles, which depends on their hygroscopic properties, and
ii) of the optical properties of the OA that also depend on the
state of mixing of OA components with other aerosol com-
ponents and are needed for the computation of the extinction
of solar radiation.
Therefore, the following questions need to be addressed
with regard to the OA and particularly of the SOA in the
atmosphere:
– What are the SOA precursor gases? How important are
their emissions into the atmosphere? How important are
the emissions of the primary OA?
– What are the main mechanisms of SOA formation? And
how much SOA is formed in the atmosphere?
– How important is organic nucleation on a global scale?
– How can we simulate the partitioning of semivolatile
OA species between the gas and particulate phases?
Can we assume thermodynamic equilibrium between
the two phases?
– What are the hygroscopic properties of OA? How is OA
involved in the CCN formation?
– What are the optical properties of OA? And how are
they altered during ageing of the aerosols?
– How are aerosols mixed in the atmosphere? And how
does this mixing alter their chemical, physical and opti-
cal properties?
– What are the responses of the climate system to changes
in organic aerosol?
During the last decade important advances were made in un-
derstanding OA and its behaviour in the atmosphere. Dif-
ferent studies have shown in the past years that biogenic hy-
drocarbons play a signiﬁcant role in the formation of tropo-
spheric ozone and that even in urban areas with high anthro-
pogenic emissions they still need to be considered in order to
develop reliable strategies for the reduction of tropospheric
ozone (Chameides et al., 1988; Roselle, 1994; Vogel et al.,
1995; Atkinson and Arey, 1998). It has also been known for
quite some time that the oxidation of monoterpenes in the
troposphere plays a potentially important role in the gener-
ation of secondary organic particulate matter (Went, 1960;
Rasmussen, 1972; Trainer et al., 1987; Jacob and Wofsy,
1988; Andreae and Crutzen, 1997). Many biogenic hydro-
carbons show much higher reactivity towards the important
atmospheric oxidants OH, NO3 and ozone than the anthro-
pogenically emitted VOCs, which adds further to the sig-
niﬁcance of VOCs emitted from biogenic sources (BVOCs)
as a major potential contributor to global organic particulate
mater (PM) formation (Atkinson, 2000).
In recent years BVOCs have been positively identiﬁed as
precursor substances to the formation of SOA in the atmo-
sphere (Kavouras et al., 1999; Pandis et al., 1992; Yu et
al., 1999a, b). That BVOCs contribute to aerosol formation
has now been amply demonstrated in different laboratory and
outdoor chamber experiments (e.g., Palen et al., 1992; Zhang
et al., 1992; Hoffmann et al., 1997; Grifﬁn et al., 1999a;
Barnes, 2004; Hoffmann, 2001; Jaoui and Kamens, 2003a
and references therein). In spite of this there is still a paucity
of, data on and understanding of, the composition and the
properties of the aerosol formed from the gas phase photoox-
idation of biogenic hydrocarbons (Christoffersen et al., 1998;
Kavouras et al., 1998).
A number of review papers exist that are used as a start-
ing point for the present review: In 1996, Saxena and Hilde-
mann (1996) identiﬁed and estimated the solubilities of an
extensive set of water soluble organic compounds that could
be present in atmospheric particles. Atkinson et al. (1997)
have reviewed VOC gas phase chemical mechanisms, in-
cluding those leading to aerosol formation.
Seinfeld and
Pankow (2003) summarized kinetic knowledge on SOA for-
mation and appropriate parameterisations. Kulmala (2003)
described the procedure of formation and growth of parti-
cles in the atmosphere. Jacobson et al. (2000) focused on an
extensive presentation and discussion of OA measurement
techniques.
The present paper aims to build upon these earlier reviews
especially by including recently acquired knowledge in the
area of Secondary Organic Aerosol. It also intends to exam-
ine the OA problem from the point of view of climate mod-
elling and deﬁne critical areas where additional knowledge
is needed to reduce the involved uncertainties. In the next
sections, the state-of-the-art of all the components needed
for the representation of OA in a climate model is outlined:
The emission estimates of primary carbonaceous particles
and SOA precursor gases are summarized. The up-to-date
understanding of the chemical formation and transformation
of condensable organic material is outlined together with an
overview of the SOA formation representation in global cli-
mate models. Measurements of physical and optical prop-
erties of the organic aerosol are summarized and needs for
modelling studies are highlighted. The mechanisms of in-
teractions of SOA with clouds are discussed. Dry and wet
removal parameterisations in global models are outlined. Ef-
fort is put into synthesizing this information to provide a con-
tinuous ﬂow from the emitted material to the climatic impact
of the organic aerosol. The sources of uncertainties at each
individual step of the overall process are highlighted as areas
that require further studies.

Emissions of primary carbonaceous aerosols and of
SOA precursors
This section evaluates the current knowledge and uncertain-
ties of emissions of primary carbonaceous aerosol and of the
volatile organic compounds (VOC) that can contribute to the
chemical formation of organic particulate matter in the atmo-
sphere.
2.1
Primary carbonaceous emissions: global and regional
emission estimates
Sources of primary carbonaceous particles include fossil fuel
burning (especially transportation and energy production),
domestic burning (cooking and heating), and uncontained
burning of vegetation (savannah and deforestation ﬁres) and
agricultural waste.
There are a number of other types of
primary carbonaceous material in the atmosphere such as
viruses, bacteria, fungal spores and plant debris (Bauer et
al., 2002) that may be relevant because they are effective
ice nuclei (see compilation of laboratory data by Diehl and
Wurzler, 2004). Their contribution to aerosol mass may be
substantial (Wiedinmyer, 2004, and references therein), but
due to their residence in the coarse aerosol fraction, their
climate relevance is generally considered to be relatively
low. Recently a signiﬁcant marine POA source acting dur-
ing the period of high biological activity has been identiﬁed
in North Atlantic (O’Dowd et al., 2004). During phytoplank-
ton blooms, progressing from spring through autumn, bub-
ble bursting produces submicrometre particles enriched in
insoluble and high molecular mass organic matter. Unfortu-
nately there are no quantitative estimates of their global and
regional emissions, and to our knowledge there are no stud-
ies on their potential role as condensation sites for SOA. It
is currently believed that ﬁne organic particles offer surface
and mass, on which SOA precursor gases may preferentially
condense.
Note that black carbon (BC) is an operationally deﬁned
quantity and the use of BC should be accompanied by the
method used for its measurement. In the present paper we
will use the term BC since it is more relevant to climate
change. Therefore, the compiled inventories are based on
emission measurements with all types of sampling and anal-
ysis methods introducing thus signiﬁcant inconsistencies be-
tween the emission inventories and the observations.
At
present most measurement techniques can not discriminate
between the organic aerosol formed from biogenic and an-
thropogenic precursor gases and the primary carbonaceous
particles emitted from, mainly, pyrogenic processes.
A recent and extensive analysis of regional black carbon
(BC) and organic particulate carbon (OC) emissions is pro-
vided by Bond et al. (2004), using energy statistics for the
year 1996. Global emissions of BC are estimated to be 1.6,
3.3 and 3.0 Tg C y−1 for biofuel, vegetation ﬁres, and fos-
sil fuel burning, respectively. For Primary Organic Aerosol
these numbers are 9.1, 34.6, and 3.2 Tg POA y−1. Main un-
certainties are connected to the choice of emission factors
that depend on the fuel burnt and the type of combustion.
Biofuel consumption for domestic use is the source category
associated with the highest uncertainty due to the difﬁculty
in getting reliable statistics. A recent study by Schaap et
al. (2004) suggests that, at least in Europe, the BC emis-
sions of this inventory may be underestimated by a factor of
two. Novakov et al. (2003) estimated historical trends in fos-
sil fuel BC emissions since 1875. These trends show rapid
increase in the latter part of the 1800s, levelling off in the
ﬁrst part of 1900s and the re-acceleration in the past 50 years
as China and India have been developing. These changes
that have caused regionally large temporal modiﬁcations in
aerosol absorption might be accompanied by similar trends
in OA emissions. These possible emission changes and their
climate impact need to be evaluated.
2.2
SOA precursor emissions
2.2.1
Mechanism and composition of natural SOA precur-
sor emissions
VOCs are emitted into the atmosphere from natural sources
in marine and terrestrial environments, as well as from an-
thropogenic sources. A key study on global natural emis-
sions was published by Guenther et al. (1995); hereafter
called G1995, which is still the basis for later estimates of
natural VOC emissions.
On a global basis the emissions
of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), which
are emitted mainly by vegetation, are estimated to exceed
those from anthropogenic emissions (G1995: Guenther et al.,
1999, 2000). Recently, Wiedinmeyer et al. (2004), hereafter
W2004, provided an excellent review paper of emissions of
organics from vegetation. Here we focus on those emissions
and their uncertainties relevant for SOA formation.
Isoprene accounts for about half of all natural VOC emis-
sions and is, on a mass basis, the dominant emitted biogenic
VOC component. Estimated global emissions range between
250 and 750 Tg C y−1 (W2004). However, isoprene is gen-
erally not considered as a major producer of SOA. Very re-
cent studies, however, detected the presence of humic like
substances, glycol aldehyde and hydroxy aceton as well as
methyltetrols indicating involvement of isoprene as source
for SOA (Jang et al., 2003a; Claeys et al., 2004a, b; Limbeck
et al., 2003; Matsunaga et al., 2003). Claeys et al. (2004a)
proposed that a small (0.2%) fraction of all isoprene may be
converted into SOA, corresponding to 2 Tg y−1 emissions.
This number deserves revision since fastly after Claeys et
al. (2004b) suggested that aqueous phase oxidation of iso-
prene products is a more important source of SOA. Thus
far more than 5000 terpenes have been identiﬁed (Geron
et al., 2000), such as monoterpenes (C10), sesquiterpenes
(C15), diterpenes (C20) and higher molecular weight com-
pounds. Most important components in the group ‘terpenes’,

after isoprene that is a hemi-terpene, are the mono-terpenes
(C10H16) α-pinene, β-pinene, sabinene, and limonene (Ta-
ble 1), accounting for 40–80% of the overall terpene emis-
sion on a global scale when isoprene is excluded. Field mea-
surements have shown that the mono-terpenes represent a
signiﬁcant fraction of the BVOCs emitted from vegetation to
the atmosphere with contributions ranging from 10 to 50%
dependent on the type of vegetation prevailing in the area
(G1995; Guenther, 1995; Guenther et al., 2000).
Excluding isoprene and methane, VOCs from biogenic
sources are often divided (G1995) into the lumped cate-
gories i) terpenes, ii) other reactive VOC (ORVOC) and iii)
other VOCs (OVOCs).
In the widely used GEIA dataset
(URL http://geiacenter.org/), the latter two are lumped to-
gether.
ORVOC represent reactive VOCs, with lifetimes
<1 day, such as terpenoid alcohols, n-carbonyls, aromat-
ics, sesquiterpenes (C15H24), terpenoid ketones and higher
oleﬁns. OVOCs are the less reactive VOCs, with lifetimes
longer than 1 day, typically methanol, various aldehydes and
ketones. The latter are believed to have little aerosol for-
mation potential, and are not further considered in this sec-
tion. Note however that recent studies report that >C7 car-
bonyls may be important contributors to SOA (Matsunaga et
al., 2003). Current analytical methods may need to be im-
proved before we can accurately quantify these compounds.
According to Grifﬁn et al. (1999b), only about 30% of the
lumped ORVOC and OVOCs have the potential to form SOA.
In contrast, the mono-terpenes, and especially the sesquiter-
penes (100%), have large potential for SOA formation. Note
also that lumping of various chemical compounds in the
emissions inventories like for instance ORVOC puts together
compounds that form aerosols with compounds that are not
precursors of SOA. This introduces further uncertainties in
the SOA modelling.
Woods, crops and shrubs contribute by 55%, 15%, and
14%, respectively, to the non-isoprene biogenic emissions
(G1995), whereas oceans emit <1%. Emission amounts and
composition are species and thus ecosystem dependent; the
main external factors inﬂuencing emissions are i) tempera-
ture ii) light (for some species) and iii) water stress. G1995
describe an algorithm that uses ecosystem input data, emis-
sion factors, light and temperature dependent functions and
a canopy radiative transfer model.
The most recent up-
dates of the algorithms are provided by the MEGAN activity
(http://cdp.ucar.edu).
Seinfeld and Pankow (2003) combined the Grifﬁn et
al. (1999b) ORVOC breakdown in smaller chemical cate-
gories and classify the SOA forming compounds in a total of
11 categories, which encompass on a global scale most of the
observed terpenes and ORVOCs emissions, with the Guen-
ther et al. (1995) mass emissions. For comparison we also
give the fractions obtained in N. America (Geron et al., 2000)
and Southern Europe Mediterranean (Owen et al., 2001). As
becomes apparent in Table 2, the species contributions to
the emissions adopted in global models is rather similar to
those obtained by regional estimates. However, care should
be taken in extrapolating regional results to the global scale,
since precursors like sesquiterpenes that have the largest po-
tential in forming SOA (e.g. Vizuete et al., 2004) have also
highly uncertain emissions.
2.2.2
Anthropogenic SOA precursor emissions
Aromatic components have also the potential to form SOA
(Odum et al., 1997).

adopted the EDGAR2.0 database (Olivier et al., 1996, 1999a)
for the anthropogenic emissions of SOA precursor gases.
This database is giving global emissions of 6.7 Tg y−1
toluene, 4.5 Tg y−1 xylene, 0.8 Tg y−1 trimethylbenzene and
3.8 Tg y−1 of other aromatics. These emissions add up to
about 10–15% of all anthropogenic NMVOC emissions.
These values were determined for the year 1990; emission
factors are highly uncertain, and moreover subject to strong
temporal changes. e.g. in Europe and USA decreasing trends
of hydrocarbon emissions have been reported in the last 2–
3 decades. In the USA, reported NMVOC emissions have
been decreasing from 35 kT y−1 in 1970 to 20 kT y−1 in 2001
(http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/trends/index.html). From sec-
tor analysis it follows that trafﬁc, industrial processes and
solvent use were responsible for that large decrease. In Eu-
rope, reported emissions decreased in the EU from 16 kT y−1
in 1989 to 12 kT y−1 in 2000 (EMEP, 2003). Latter trends
are conﬁrmed by a limited number of measurements (Monks
et al., 2003). Reductions have been reported for acetylene,
ethane, benzene and toluene (Roemer, 2001). In contrast, in
the period 1970–2000, in South and East Asia and China an-
thropogenic NMVOC emissions may have increased by 50
% (IIASA, M. Amann, personal communication, 2004) from
41 to 63 Tg y−1.
2.2.3
Global and regional estimates
A gridded compilation of the global emissions, divided into
two categories, terpenes and the lumped ORVOC and OVOC,
has been made by G1995. Table 2 gives the regional break-
down of the primary anthropogenic organic aerosol (POA)
ﬂux estimates by Bond (2004) and terpene and ORVOC
emissions. Note that the importance of oceans (O’Dowd et
al., 2004) and of vegetation as natural sources of POA re-
mains to be determined. As a rough estimate, assuming that
a constant fraction of 0.15 of the terpene emissions reacts
on a very short timescale to form SOA then 19.1 Tg y−1 of
SOA are calculated to be globally produced by terpenes. This
crude assumption provides an order-of-magnitude compar-
ison of the relative importance of SOA versus primary or-
ganic aerosol emissions on regional and global scales. This
estimate shows that the SOA contribution to OA is likely to
be highly variable ranging from 10–70%, in Eastern Europe,
and Canada, respectively. Obviously this approach should be
viewed with caution, since as discussed below, SOA forma-
tion is a complex and not yet sufﬁciently understood process.
In addition, Tsigaridis and Kanakidou (2003) have shown
that a signiﬁcant proportion of the SOA formation occurs in
the free troposphere due to enhanced condensation favoured
by low temperatures. This is crucial for SOA fate since the
lifetime of aerosol is larger in the free troposphere than in the
boundary layer as discussed in Sect. 4.3.
We can make a similar, but even more speculative, analysis
of the importance of ORVOC as precursor for SOA. If 30%
of the ORVOC emissions can form SOA (of which 5% con-
sist of sesquiterpenes), assuming a 100% aerosol yield for the
sesquiterpenes (higher than reported by Grifﬁn et al., 1999b),
and 15% for the other components, an additional amount of
15 Tg SOA y−1 could be formed, with regional contributions
varying between 10 and 50%. Following the hypothesis by
Claeys et al. (2004a) that a small but signiﬁcant fraction of
isoprene oxidation products may lead to SOA, an additional
amount of 2 Tg SOA y−1, may be formed, 65% of which can
be attributed to Africa and S. America. In addition, anthro-
pogenic organic compounds like aromatics are also forming
SOA (see Sect. 3) although their contribution based on actual
understanding of their chemistry has been evaluated to be a
small fraction (about 10%) of the global SOA formation in
the troposphere (Tsigaridis and Kanakidou, 2003), although
locally might be much more important. This contribution
is of the same order of magnitude with the naturally driven
variation of the SOA chemical production (Tsigaridis et al.,
2005).
According to these rough estimates, the chemical forma-
tion of SOA may be signiﬁcant when compared to the pri-
mary carbonaceous emissions (about 60% on a global scale
and even more regionally).
2.2.4
Uncertainties of estimates
There are large uncertainties associated with both anthro-
pogenic and natural emission inventories on regional and
global scales. For instance, using detailed land cover and
tree species information Guenther et al. (2000) estimated for
North America monoterpene emissions of 17.9 and ORVOC
emissions of 31.8 Tg y−1. These can be compared with 13.1

1059
and 17.7 Tg y−1 presented in Table 2 (for USA and Canada).
A difference of 30 to 80% between these two inventories
is deduced. This can not be generalised since other inven-
tories might compare better. This is the case for the esti-
mate of 6.1 Tg y−1 terpene and OVOC emissions by Simp-
son et al. (1999) for OECD Europe that is comparable to
the 6.2 Tg y−1 given in Table 2. However, when comparing
Simpson et al. (1999) in more detail with country speciﬁc
data compiled by Lenz (2001) differences of a factor of 2
show up over Europe as can be seen from Table 3 where both
emission estimates for Italy and for France are compared.
These regional differences and uncertainties propagate to
the global scale inventories.
As described before, forests
have the largest potential to form SOA. Global emissions es-
timates of isoprene have an overall uncertainty of a factor
of 3 (250-750 TgC y−1, W2004) whereas those of the other
terpenes and sesquiterpenes that are the main known SOA
precursors are subject to a factor of 5 uncertainty (W2004).
In addition, branch enclosure measurements by Goldstein
et al. (2004) conﬁrm more than 100 BVOCs are emitted
but not typically observed over the forest; these unmeasured
BVOC emissions are approximately 10 times the measured
monoterpene ﬂuxes. An extensive overview of the uncertain-
ties in these emissions and the global uncertainty range is
given by W2004. The main uncertainties are associated with
(W2004):
1. tree speciﬁc emissions factors and functions
2. the use of geographical data-bases of land-cover, eco-
systems and tree abundances
3. foliar density and phenology of these trees
4. environmental conditions.
Most emission rates adopted for the construction of the in-
ventories of biogenic emissions and in particular those of
monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes have not been evaluated
based on measured ambient concentrations. There is a clear
need for more data on emissions chemical speciation since
aerosol formation potential largely depends on the chemi-
cal structure of the precursor molecules. This applies par-
ticularly to sesquiterpenes that are known to have the largest
potential to form SOA and their emission factors have been
poorly studied.
Anthropogenic VOC emissions are 5–10 times lower than
biogenic VOC emissions (excluding CH4). When consid-
ering the known SOA precursor emissions alone, this ra-
tio increases above 10.
Large uncertainties exist also in
the anthropogenic emission factors for SOA precursors like
aromatics and some oxygenated solvents. Global invento-
ries of NMVOC anthropogenic emissions are generally cal-
culated in two steps.
First, using an emission factor ap-
proach, total NMVOC emissions are calculated on the ba-
sis of (inter)national activity statistics (e.g. fuel consump-
tion, solvent use) and emission factors that take into account
Table 3. Comparison of BVOC emissions – Lenz (2001) and Simp-
son et al. (1999) – for forest tree species in Italy and France (in
Gg y−1).

abatement technologies. According to Olivier et al. (1999b),
the uncertainty in total NMVOC emissions has been es-
timated to be ∼50% for fossil fuel related emissions and
∼100% for non fossil fuel emissions.
Second, the to-
tal NMVOC emissions are generally subdivided in speciﬁc
NMVOC species clusters. Toluene, xylene and trimethyl-
benzene are three different NMVOC groups for which an
emission proﬁle has been deﬁned in the EDGAR database
(Oliver et al., 1996). For each NMVOC proﬁle an activ-
ity speciﬁc proﬁle has been deﬁned, which assigns the frac-
tion of each of the NMVOC group to the total NMVOC
emissions. In general global uniform NMVOC proﬁles are
based on data from USA and EU countries (e.g. http://
www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/software/speciate/index.html or http:
//reports.eea.eu.int/EMEPCORINAIR3/en). Application of
these global aggregated NMVOC proﬁles leads to another
considerable uncertainty.
Speciﬁc quantitative uncertainty
estimates on toluene, xylene and trimethylbenzene are – to
our best knowledge – not available at the moment.
2.2.5
Change of Natural Emissions due to land-use and cli-
mate change
Global use of land has been changing in the last 2 cen-
turies, and is expected to be further modiﬁed in the future.
The largest recent changes of land-use are in the tropics,
mainly due to conversion of tropical forests into crop-lands.
For instance from 1970–2000 forest areas in Asia, Latin
America and Africa have decreased by 26, 12 and 13%, re-
spectively (source: IMAGE2.2; http://arch.rivm.nl/image/).
Global forests decreased by 2% in this period. According
to the FAO 2003 State of the World Forest Report (http:
//www.fao.org/DOCREP/005/Y7581E/Y7581E00.HTM) the
decadal deforestation rates for the above mentioned areas
were 1, 4, and 8% in the period 1990–2000.
Naik et al. (2004) using a dynamic global ecosystem
model calculated that the combined ﬂuctuations in climate
and atmospheric CO2 during 1971–1990 caused signiﬁcant
seasonal (17–25%) and interannual (2–4%) variability in the
simulated global isoprenoid ﬂuxes with an increasing trend
during this time period.

M. Kanakidou et al.: Organic aerosol and global climate modelling
The quantiﬁcation of the impact of climate change on fu-
ture biogenic VOC emissions remains complex. The most
important effect might be an increase in emission rates as
a direct result of higher temperatures; however changes in
cloudiness, precipitation, and land use may inﬂuence emis-
sions as well. Little is known about the ﬁnal combined effect
of land-use change and climate change on VOC emissions.
An exemplary model study by Sanderson et al. (2002) com-
bining climate change and land-use changes suggests that
global isoprene emissions may increase by 27%.
2.3
Uncertainties and Research Needs
– The overall knowledge of emissions both of primary
carbonaceous particles and of gaseous precursors of
SOA is far from being satisfactory. The overall uncer-
tainties range between a factor of 2 and 5.
– Signiﬁcant effort needs to be put in improving the
BC and OC inventories however progress can be only
achieved via standardizing the BC measurements.
– POA appears to be quite an important part of the car-
bonaceous aerosol.
However accurate emission esti-
mates received relatively little attention. Further stud-
ies based on coherent observations are required to con-
struct reliable POA emission inventories not only from
the anthropogenic sources that are the most commonly
considered in modelling studies but also from the bio-
genic sources, the importance of which remains to
be determined.
In particular the potential important
POA marine source from the ocean currently omitted
from climate modelling prediction should be evaluated
(O’Dowd et al., 2004).
– Although sesquiterpenes are known to be the most ef-
ﬁcient natural SOA precursors (see further discussion)
their emission rates from vegetation have been poorly
studied due to their high reactivity and require more
attention in the future with targeted experimental and
modelling studies.
– Future studies to improve our knowledge on primary
emissions invoke integration of various approaches to
address these questions such as:
– enclosure measurements
– above-canopy and deposition ﬂux measurements of
gases and aerosols
– ambient concentrations measurements
– both forward and inverse modelling to link emis-
sions with observed concentrations
– use of satellite observations in models to evalu-
ate/improve emission inventories or derive them,
see for instance examples by Abbot et al. (2003)
and Martin et al. (2003).
– The consistency of emission inventories with the ambi-
ent observed concentrations can be evaluated by apply-
ing chemistry/transport models to simulate the observed
concentrations based on these emission inventories.

Representation of Secondary Organic Aerosol forma-
tion in atmospheric models
The processes leading to SOA formation can be viewed as
occurring sequentially:
Emissions

gases
→
Gas-phase
chemistry
↔
Nucleation/Gas-particle
partitioning
↔
Aerosol-
phase/aqueous phase chemistry/cloud processing
To represent SOA formation quantitatively requires each
of these steps to be modelled. At present, although the po-
tential importance of aerosol-phase chemistry has been re-
cently established through the identiﬁcation of oligomeric
species (see Sect. 3.1); these reactions are not yet represented
in models.
In this section we ﬁrst summarize actual knowledge on the
chemical reactions responsible for SOA formation (Sect. 3.1)
and on the involvement of SOA constituents in nucleation
(Sect. 3.2).
Then, the aerosol dynamics are summarised
(Sect. 3.3) and the gas-to-particle partitioning parameterisa-
tions used in atmospheric models (Sect. 3.4) are outlined and
ﬁnally in Sect. 3.5 the actual representation of SOA forma-
tion in current global models is summarized.
3.1
Chemistry of Secondary Organic Aerosol formation
Since monoterpenes would appear to be the major precur-
sors of secondary organic particulate matter (SOA) from
BVOCs, much work has gone into investigating the reactions
of monoterpenes, particularly over the past decade. Sum-
maries, up to 2000, of the gas-phase kinetics of the monoter-
pene reactions with OH and NO3 radicals and ozone, prod-
ucts of these reactions and the pathways leading to their for-
mation can be found in several review articles/books (e.g.,
Atkinson, 1997; Atkinson and Arey, 1998; Calogirou et al.,
1999; Calvert et al., 2000).
Seinfeld and Pankow (2003)
have summarized laboratory studies of SOA formation per-
formed over the last decade. The studies have been cate-
gorized according to the experimental conditions employed
such as NOx photooxidation, O3 reaction or OH reaction.
As a result of ever increasing information on the nature of
the gas-phase products and the composition of the resulting
aerosol from the oxidation of monoterpenes much effort is
now being spent in developing combined gas-phase kinetics
and aerosol partitioning models to represent secondary or-
ganic aerosol formation in ambient models. (e.g., Kamens
et al., 1999; Kamens and Jaoui, 2001; Pankow et al., 2001;
Seinfeld et al., 2001; Grifﬁn et al., 2002a, b, 2003; Pun et al.,
2002).

Most of the experiments on the atmospheric chemistry of
monoterpenes, i.e. gas-phase kinetic rate coefﬁcients, gas-
phase product identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation, quantiﬁca-
tion of SOA yields and its molecular composition, have been
performed in smog chambers using either natural or artiﬁ-
cial sunlight. Seinfeld and Pankow (2003) have discussed the
pros and cons of the size of the chamber, indoor and outdoor
chambers with artiﬁcial and natural light sources, etc and the
arguments will not be pursued further here. However, irre-
spective of the type of chamber, chamber experiments have
inherent difﬁculties associated with the chemistry of SOA
formation when extrapolating the results to atmospheric con-
ditions.
– Carefully designed chamber experiments using modern
analytical techniques to allow accurate quantitative de-
tection of organics at low concentrations, are needed
to investigate SOA formation under atmospheric con-
ditions.
In the case of the NOx photooxidation systems oxidation by
the OH radical will initially dominate, however, as the re-
action proceeds, O3 and under some circumstances also NO3
radicals will be formed in high enough concentration to com-
pete with the OH radical oxidation. This makes assignment
of the relative importance of the oxidants OH, NO3 and O3 in
the SOA formation problematic. In the ozonolysis reactions
peroxy radicals will be formed which under most normal at-
mospheric conditions would react with NO to form alkoxy
radicals. Ozonolysis experiments can not be performed in
the laboratory in the presence of NOx since the NOx reacts
rapidly with O3.
– It is, therefore still an open question as to whether the
aerosol yields observed in laboratory ozonolysis exper-
iments are transferable to atmospheric conditions; in re-
ality the yields could be higher or lower.
Recently, Docherty and Ziemann (2003), Ziemann (2003)
and Keywood et al. (2004) have shown that the presence of
OH scavenger in ozonolysis experiments has signiﬁcant im-
pact on SOA yields. Keywood et al. (2004) explained this be-
haviour by the involvement of acylperoxyradicals formed via
isomerisation of alkoxy radical which in turn are produced
from Crieege Intermediates during ozonolysis of endocyclic
alkenes. Winterhalter et al. (2000), Koch et al. (2000) and
Jenkin et al. (2000) showed that acylperoxy radicals from
both endo- and exocyclic monoterpenes are involved in the
formation of dicarboxylic acids via permutation reactions
with HO2 or RO2 radicals. These radical reactions are ini-
tiated by the decomposition of the excited Criegee Inter-
mediates via the hydroperoxy channel or the ester channel
(Calvert et al., 2000). Bonn et al. (2002) have recently shown
that the addition of H2O and carbonyl compounds affects the
yield of SOA. This observation was explained by the involve-
ment of stabilized Criegee Intermediates in the SOA forma-
tion processes.
The translation of these results to the real atmosphere re-
quires thorough interpretation and further understanding of
the corresponding chemical mechanisms. For the reaction of
NO3 with monoterpenes this may also be an issue but be-
cause the reactions occur mainly during the night time when
NO is low the effect (if any) will not be so far reaching.
– In NO3 radical chamber chemistry systems, however,
reactions of the high levels of NOx often employed can
block many reaction pathways, which would otherwise
be important under atmospheric conditions.
3.1.1
Gas phase reactions leading to semivolatile products
Because of the potential importance of monoterpenes to SOA
formation much of the research related to elucidating the ox-
idation mechanisms and products of monoterpenes known
to be emitted into the troposphere in substantial quantities
(Atkinson and Arey, 1998; Calogirou et al., 1999) has been
focussed primarily on α- and β-pinene. Measurements of
monoterpenes speciation suggest that these make a particu-
larly signiﬁcant contribution to global monoterpenes emis-
sions (Guenther et al., 1994; Geron et al., 2000 and refer-
ences therein). These monoterpenes are also representative
of classes of monoterpenes having either an endocyclic dou-
ble bond (in the case of α-pinene) or an exocyclic double
bond (in the case of β-pinene), therefore, the discussion on
monoterpenes chemistry leading to SOA will focus on these
two compounds and, in particular, on α-pinene.
In the case of α-pinene considerable progress has been
made in determining the kinetics and elucidating the mecha-
nisms of the early stages of its gas-phase degradation chem-
istry initiated by reaction with OH radicals (e.g., Arey et al.,
1990; Hakola et al., 1994; Hallquist et al., 1997; Vinckier
et al., 1997; Aschmann et al., 1998; Noziere et al., 1999a;
Orlando et al., 2000; Jaoui and Kamens, 2001; Larsen et al.,
2001; Wisthaler et al., 2001; Winterhalter et al., 2003), NO3
radicals (e.g., Wangberg et al., 1997; Berndt and B¨oge, 1997;
Hallquist et al., 1997; Jang and Kamens, 1999) and ozone
(e.g., Hakola et al., 1994; Alvarado et al., 1998a; Kamens et
al., 1999; Yu et al., 1999a; Koch et al., 2000; Orlando et al.,
2000; Winterhalter et al., 2003). The further oxidation of the
major ﬁrst generation product, pinonaldehyde, has also been
studied quite extensively (e.g., Glasius et al., 1997; Hallquist
et al., 1997; Alvarado et al., 1998b; Noziere et al., 1999a, b;
Jaoui and Kamens, 2003a). There have also been some the-
oretical studies of the oxidation mechanisms (Peeters et al.,
2001; Vereecken and Peeters, 2000).
The reactions with OH, NO3 and O3 lead to a large
suite of oxygenated reaction products which include alde-
hydes, oxy-aldehydes, carboxylic acids, oxy-carboxylic
acids, hydroxy-carboxylic acids, dicarboxylic acids, or-
ganic nitrates etc.
In addition, several peaks with m/z
187 [M+H]+ observed in the LC-MS analysis of ﬁl-
ter samples from the oxidation of α-pinene (Hoffmann,

1063
– There is mounting evidence from laboratory studies of
monoterpenes oxidation by O3, OH- and NO3-radicals
that the most important process with regard to aerosol
formation is the reaction with ozone (Hoffmann et al.,
1997; OSOA project: Hoffmann, 2001).
– There is very little and fragmentary information avail-
able about the SOA yields from sesquiterpenes. These
yields are much higher than those of the monoterpenes
(17–67% on a mass basis reported by Grifﬁn et al.,
1999b) and based on these yields the contribution of
sesquiterpenes to SOA global formation may be up to
9% (Grifﬁn et al., 1999a).
Oxidation products of pinenes others than those detected dur-
ing ozonolysis chamber experiments have been observed in
the ambient SOA suggesting that other oxidants and sec-
ondary reactions may be involved in oxidized SOA forma-
tion (Claeys et al., 2004b; Edney et al., 2003; Kub´atov´a et
al., 2002).
The contributions of the three major oxidation processes of
monoterpenes (OH, NO3 and ozone) to new aerosol forma-
tion and aerosol yield have been found in laboratory studies
to be very different for the three possible reactions.
– Ozone was found by far to have the highest potential to
form new particles at similar reactant consumption rates
of α-pinene as well as for β-pinene (Bonn and Moort-
gat, 2002).
– Reactions of the monoterpenes with either OH or NO3
result in remarkably less nucleation but with minor dif-
ferences in the new-formed aerosol volume compared
to the ozone reaction. This suggests that products with
higher volatility than in the ozone experiments may
have been formed in OH and NO3 reactions (Hoffmann,
2001).
For new particle formation to occur by homomolecular nu-
cleation, an oxygenated product must be generated in the
gas phase at a concentration in substantial excess of its sat-
uration vapour concentration with respect to the condensed
phase. Oxygenated products capable of generating new parti-
cles in the atmosphere must of necessity be particularly non-
volatile. Inclusion of polar functional groups with retention
of carbon number will reduce product volatility quite con-
siderably in comparison with that of the parent hydrocarbon.
Experimental evidence indicates that high molecular weight
compounds containing the –OH, -C=O and, in particular, the
carboxylic acid -C(=O)OH functionality are particularly im-
portant in this respect (e.g., Tao and McMurry, 1989; Yu et
al., 1998 and references therein). The ability of most SOA
compounds to nucleate in the atmosphere is not well under-
stood and is the topic of current research. One needs to un-
derstand not only the volatility of these compounds but also
their surface energy because of the importance of the Kelvin
effect for nucleation. Note, that the increase in molecular
weight leads to greater Kelvin effect (Seinfeld and Pandis,
1998) that hinders the homogeneous nucleation. Therefore,
for an organic species to homogeneously nucleate, the low-
ering of vapour pressure when increasing functionality with
increased molecular weight should overcome the counteract-
ing Kelvin effect.
Until recently, dicarboxylic acids were the lowest volatile
compounds positively identiﬁed in terpenes generated
aerosol.
cis-Pinic acid (a C9 dicarboxylic acid) has been
identiﬁed as a condensed product of the ozonolysis of both
α- and β-pinene (e.g., Christoffersen et al., 1998; Hoffmann
et al., 1998; Glasius et al., 2000; Kamens et al., 1999; Jaoui
and Kamens, 2003b, c).
It has been suggested (Koch et al., 2000; Winterhalter et
al., 2000; Jenkin et al., 2000) that cis-pinic acid is the most
likely photooxidation product of both α- and β-pinene that
will result in prompt formation of new aerosols by nucle-
ation.
Pathways leading to cis-pinic acid have been sug-
gested from the secondary reactions of the ﬁrst-generation
gas-phase products generated in monoterpenes photooxida-
tion (Jenkin et al., 1997) or from their auto-oxidation in the
condensed phase (Jang and Kamens, 1999). However, as
remarked by Jenkin et al. (2000) the observed timescale of
aerosol formation (Koch et al., 1999) appears to require that
cis-pinic acid is itself a “1st-generation product”. Winterhal-
ter et al. (2000), Koch et al. (2000) and Jenkin et al. (2000)
have suggested a possible mechanism for the formation of
cis-pinic acid from the ozonolysis of both α- and β-pinene.
These mechanisms have been discussed by Jenkin (2004).
The key intermediate is an acyl radical (see circled interme-
diate in Fig. 2, adopted from Winterhalter et al., 2000), which
is formed from exo- and endocyclic alkenes, like α- and β-
pinene. Two pathways are proposed for this acyl radical. Ei-
ther isomerisation of the complex C9-acyloxy radical by an
1,7 H atom shift (see Fig. 2, Pathway A: Jenkin et al., 2000)
or reaction with HO2, yielding pinalic peroxo acid, which
ﬁnally isomerizes to cis-pinic acid (Fig. 2: Pathway B: Win-
terhalter et al., 2000).
– There is, however, evidence that compounds less
volatile than dicarboxylic acids are present in the
aerosol.
Edney et al. (2003) and Kub´atov´a et al. (2002) have detected
a C8 tricarboxylic acid, an α-pinene oxidation product, in
semi-rural and urban aerosols. Ziemann (2002) has presented
evidence for the possible formation of diacyl peroxides in
the ozonolysis of cyclohexene and homologous compounds
and has suggested that these compounds may be the major
nucleating agent in these systems and are also responsible
for a signiﬁcant fraction of the aerosol mass.
Mechanisms have been developed to describe the reaction
pathways leading to these products. For example, explicit
or lumped degradation schemes can be found for the chem-
istry of both α- and β-pinene either in the new version of the

Fig. 2. Reaction mechanism for the ozonolysis of α-pinene (adopted from Winterhalter et al., 2003). The two Criegee Intermediates and
the main decomposition channel (Hydroperoxyde channel) are highlighted with square boxes. One channel leads to the formation of an
acyl-type radical (circle), which can also be formed in case of β-pinene. Consecutive reactions of this acyl radical then lead to cis-pinic acid
(also highlighted by circles) via two possible pathways (A: Jenkin et al., 2000, B: Winterhalter et al., 2000).
Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM version 3: Saunders et
al., 2003; http://www.chem.leeds.ac.uk/Atmospheric/MCM/
mcmproj.html) or SAPRC-97 and SAPRC-99 (Carter, 1997,
1999). Figure 2 shows a schematic overview of the possi-
ble pathways in the ozonolysis of α-pinene leading to prod-
ucts which have been observed experimentally (Winterhalter
et al., 2003) indicating also the formation of hydroxyperox-
ides. Recent effort by Jenkin (2004) to model the formation
and composition of SOA produced during the ozonolysis of
pinene using the MCM mechanism (v3) is also pointing to
the key role of multifunctional products of VOC oxidation in
SOA formation which contain, for example, the hydroperox-
ide functionality. Bonn et al. (2004) have also pointed out
the importance of hydroperoxides in global SOA formation.
3.1.2
Organic polymerisation in the aerosol phase
A long-standing puzzle associated with the analysis of
molecular speciation of SOA has been the presence in the
aerosol of species whose vapour pressures are far too high
to support signiﬁcant partitioning into the aerosol phase

(Forstner et al., 1997ab; Yu et al., 1998, 1999a, b). It was
speculated that these relatively small and volatile species
might actually be decomposition products of larger, less
volatile molecules that were broken apart by the relatively
harsh environment of the mass spectrometric methods tra-
ditionally used for analysis. Very recently, high molecular
weight (and therefore low vapour pressure) products have
been identiﬁed in the aerosol phase using analytical tech-
niques that do not tend to break the molecules apart (Kalberer
et al., 2004; Tolocka et al., 2004; Gao et al., 2004). Ex-
perimental results are just now emerging, but the existence
of heterogeneous reactions between semi-volatile condensed
SOA products to yield compounds of much lower volatility
could play an important role in causing SOA yields to ex-
ceed those calculated solely on gas-particle partitioning of
the gaseous semi-volatile oxidation products.
Oligomer and/or polymer formation following both bio-
genic and anthropogenic VOC degradation has been proven
and may be considered as responsible for an important
fraction of the SOA chemical build up in the troposphere
(Tolocka et al., 2004; Kalberer et al., 2004; Gao et al., 2004).
Limbeck et al. (2003) have shown that SOA formation of
atmospheric polymers – humic like substances – occurs by
heterogeneous reaction of isoprenoid and terpenoid emission
in the presence of a sulphuric acid aerosol catalyst. Jang et
al. (2002, 2003) presented chemical mechanisms leading to
the formation of low volatility organic products from oxi-
dation of aldehydes by acid-catalysed heterogeneous reac-
tions.
Iinuma et al. (2004) and Gao et al. (2004) found
that acid catalysis can increase by about 40% the particle
phase organics produced during ozonolysis experiments and
suggest that condensation of smaller molecules takes place
by polymerization or aldol condensation following the for-

mation of aldehydes from terpenes ozonolysis. Tolocka et
al. (2004) and Gao et al. (2004) have identiﬁed oligomers as
large as tetramers in chamber experiments during α-pinene
ozonolysis using acidic inorganic seed aerosol. They con-
clude that α-pinene ozonolysis in the presence of an acid
catalyst is strongly inﬂuenced by oligomerisation reactions
of primary ozonolysis products, most likely by aldol conden-
sation and/or gem-diol formation (Fig. 3). An ion consistent
with the dimer of pinonaldehyde has been also detected on
ambient aerosols (Tolocka et al., 2004). These recent dis-
coveries provide a new point of view for SOA formation ex-
perimental studies and modelling. The exact mechanisms of
the oligomer and/or polymer formation and their signiﬁcance
for the chemical formation and properties of the secondary
organic aerosol remain to be determined.
3.1.3
Multiphase oxidation of hydrated gases
Claeys et al. (2004a) have analysed aerosols from the Ama-
zonian rain forest and identiﬁed in the ﬁne size fraction con-
siderable quantities of a mixture of two diastereoisomeric
2-methyltetrols,
2-methylthreitol and 2-methylerythritol,
which they proposed could be explained by isoprene oxida-
tion. Note that, until recently, isoprene was not considered a
signiﬁcant contributor to SOA.
The ﬁrst paper was followed very quickly by a second,
Claeys et al. (2004b), in which they revise the mechanism
postulated in Claeys et al. (2004a) by which 2-methyltetrols
are generated from isoprene. In their latest study they pro-
pose the multiphase acid-catalysed oxidation of isoprene,
methacrolein and methacrylic acid with hydrogen peroxide
as a new route to SOA formation. They mention that par-
titioning of isoprene into the aqueous phase is expected to
be enhanced under acidic conditions since isoprene is hy-
drated in aqueous solutions of sulphuric acid (Ryabova et
al., 1992). Based on preliminary kinetic studies, Claeys et
al. (2004b) suggest that these SOA forming reactions are
more likely to occur in hydrated aerosols or haze droplets
rather than in short-lived cloud droplets. Finally, they sug-
gest that monoterpenes and their gas phase oxidation prod-
ucts might undergo similar multiphase reactions leading to
SOA formation.
This proposed multiphase mechanism, reaction with hy-
drogen peroxide under acidic conditions is an analogue to
atmospheric sulphate formation and is different from all pre-
viously mentioned mechanisms. The importance of this new
route in the global SOA formation requires investigation;
however, this will only be possible when an improved under-
standing of the actual mechanism and the associated kinetic
data become available.
3.1.4
Concluding remarks
Over the past decade signiﬁcant progress has been made in
our understanding of the gas-phase oxidation mechanisms of
biogenic hydrocarbons. However, our knowledge is far from
being complete and many gaps exist in the determination
– of all potential gaseous anthropogenic and biogenic pre-
cursor molecules of SOA,
– of the secondary photooxidation processes in the gas
phase leading to low volatility compounds and thus to
SOA formation,
– of the impact of NOx levels on the ﬁnal products of the
SOA formation chemistry
– of the heterogeneous reactions between particle associ-
ated substances and gaseous compounds able to modify
the composition and the mass of aerosol,
– of the aerosol chemistry responsible for the recently re-
ported oligomer formation which increases the aerosol
mass,
– of the aqueous phase chemistry, which might produce
semi-volatile compounds that build up aerosol mass,
– of the complete molecular composition of the aerosol
produced from the above mentioned processes.
A full appreciation of all the processes involved will proba-
bly have to await the evolution of new more powerful ana-
lytical probing techniques that are starting to emerge. Fur-
ther experimental work is also needed in order to translate
laboratory results obtained in high concentrations of organic
precursors and oxidants to atmospheric conditions with often
much lower concentrations.
3.2
Nucleation
The ability of SOA compounds to form new particles in the
atmosphere is a rather controversial issue. In the laboratory,
formation of new particles is routinely observed during oxi-
dation of SOA precursors (Stern et al., 1987; Hatakeyama et
al., 1989; Pandis et al., 1991; Wang et al., 1992; Hoffmann
et al., 1998; Koch et al., 2000; Hoppel et al., 2001; Bonn et
al., 2002). However, these experiments often use moderate
to high concentrations of VOCs and no pre-existing aerosol.
For example, reaction of 20 ppb of α-pinene with 120 ppb of
ozone and no pre-existing particles can create 50 000 cm−3
(Hoppel et al., 2001). Nucleation in these systems (even at
high concentrations) can be relatively easily suppressed if a
moderate concentration of seed aerosol is present (Cocker et
al., 2001a, b). In this case the SOA compounds condense on
the pre-existing aerosols and nucleation does not take place
at the same time. Many studies have reported rather frequent
nucleation events in the boundary layer and free troposphere
in a variety of environments (see Kulmala et al., 2004a for
a review of ﬁeld observations). It has been suggested that

some of these observed new particle formation events in re-
mote areas may be due to nucleation of biogenic SOA com-
pounds (Marti et al., 1997; O’Dowd et al., 2002; Kavouras
and Stephanou, 2002).
The potential for the formation of new particles during var-
ious reactions of α- and β-pinene was investigated by Bonn
and Moortgat (2002). Their experiments indicated that the
ozonolysis dominates the new particle formation compared
to the reactions with OH and NO3. The authors argued that
ozonolysis is probably the only atmospherically relevant or-
ganic source for new particle formation from biogenic pre-
cursors, because of the low atmospheric concentrations of
these biogenic compounds. The formation of new particles
during the monoterpenes ozonolysis is negatively affected
by water vapour (Bonn et al., 2002).
Bonn and Moort-
gat (2002) suggested the involvement of stabilized Criegee
Intermediates and the formation of secondary ozonides as nu-
cleating species. Bonn and Moortgat (2003) argued that the
atmospheric new particle formation observed in remote ar-
eas and generally attributed to low-volatility oxidation prod-
ucts of monoterpenes may be actually initiated by products
of sesquiterpenes reactions with ozone. The cyclic alkene
ozonolysis experiments of Ziemann (2002) suggested that di-
acyl peroxides and not dicarboxylic acids might be the nucle-
ating agents in SOA systems. Hoppel et al. (2001) concluded
that the nucleating species during α-pinene ozonolysis must
have a saturation mixing ratio lower than 10 ppt at 25oC and
that classical nucleation theory is not able to explain their
observations. For the anthropogenic emissions the processes
leading to nucleation and SOA will probably be much more
varied than for the biogenics because of the greater diversity
in the chemical structures of the compounds emitted. There
are experiments (Johnson et al., 2004b) which support that
ozone is not a major player in the aromatic systems and that
nitroaromatic compounds may be playing a dominate role.
For anthropogenic species containing double bonds, how-
ever, the evidence here again (Tobias et al., 2000; Kalberer
et al., 2000) supports that ozone reactions are probably the
most important for SOA formation.
The analysis of all the measurements in a boreal forest site
in Southern Finland indicated that the most probable new
particle formation mechanism in the area is ternary nucle-
ation of water-sulphuric acid-ammonia (Kulmala et al., 2001;
Janson et al., 2001). After nucleation the major part of the
growth is probably due to condensation of organic vapours.
However, there is lack of direct proof of this phenomenon be-
cause the composition of 1–5 nm size particles is extremely
difﬁcult to determine using the present state-of-art instru-
mentation. Similar conclusions have been reached by Marti
et al. (1997) about new particle formation in Colorado and by
Gaydos et al. (2005) about the nucleation events in the NE
US. Gao et al. (2001) also concluded based on their smog
chamber studies that sulphuric acid is a superb nucleating
species, while secondary organic compounds probably play
a role more conﬁned to growing newly formed particles. The
dominance of sulphuric acid as a nucleating agent over atmo-
spheric organics was also suggested by the work of Tobias et
al. (2001). The authors investigated the formation of new
particles in the exhaust of a diesel engine and concluded that
the results were consistent with a mechanism of nanoparti-
cle formation involving nucleation of sulphuric acid and wa-
ter, followed by particle growth by condensation of organic
species.
Kulmala et al. (2004a) in their review of the available ﬁeld
observations of nucleation concluded that organic vapours
could, in principle, participate in nucleation, but nucleation
mechanisms that involve organics have not yet been identi-
ﬁed. It appears very likely, however, that organics contribute
to the growth of nucleated particles and indirectly affect the
formation rate of new particles of detectable sizes (Zhang
and Wexler, 2002; Anttila and Kerminen, 2003; Kulmala et
al., 2004b). Boy et al. (2003) estimated that condensation of
monoterpenes oxidation products is able to explain 10–50%
of the observed growth rates of fresh particles in Southern
Finland.
Garman et al. (2004) investigated theoretically the bi-
nary homogeneous nucleation of water-succinic acid and
water-glutaric acid based on the classical nucleation theory.
They concluded that under atmospheric conditions these bi-
nary systems would not form new particles. Kavouras and
Stephanou (2002) measured, by using a minimizing artifact
sampling device, biogenic primary organic polar compounds
and monoterpene carbonyl and acidic photooxidation prod-
ucts in both gas and particles over a Mediterranean conifer
forest. On the basis of these ﬁeld measurements they cal-
culated saturation concentrations of the acidic and carbonyl
photooxidation products for non-ideal conditions using a pre-
viously developed absorptive model (Pankow, 1994). The
results of this study suggested that the formation of SOA
goes on through a heterogeneous heteromolecular nucleation
mechanism, where the effects of both pre-existing organic
aerosol (mostly primary) and ambient temperature are cru-
cial.
The absence of nucleation events in the Amazon (Andreae,
Swietlicki personal communication), an environment with
very low sulphur concentrations but very high biogenic VOC
concentrations, strongly suggests that nucleation of purely
SOA compounds in the atmosphere may not be that fre-
quent. A potential explanation for this could be that most
low-vapour-pressure organics have high molecular weight,
but high-MW species have a strong Kelvin effect at nucle-
ation sizes as discussed in Sect. 3.1.1.
Zhang et al. (2004) based on laboratory experiments of
mixtures of aromatic acid vapours (benzoic and p- and m-
toluic acids) with sulphuric acid (H2SO4) have shown that
the presence of these organic acids enhance sulphuric acid
nucleation. Based on bonding energies theoretical calcula-
tions, they explain these ﬁnding by the formation of aromatic
acid- sulphuric acid complexes via two hydrogen bonds. The
organic acid molecule acts as both a hydrogen bond donor

and acceptor (see supporting material in Zhang et al., 2004).
These new ﬁndings on a heteromolecular nucleation mech-
anism in which both sulphuric acid and organic acids are
involved could be of crucial importance to understand for-
mation of new particles of a few (3–4) nm size in polluted
areas where both sulphuric and organic acids exist at signif-
icant levels. Kulmala et al. (2004b) further presented a new
theory that explains new particle formation via activation of
stable inorganic clusters by organic vapors.
– Therefore, based on current knowledge there is no proof
that homogeneous nucleation of organics occurs and is
of any signiﬁcance for global scale modelling.
– Organics also contribute to the growth of nucleated par-
ticles and indirectly affect the formation rate of new par-
ticles of detectable sizes.
– There is emerging evidence that heteromolecular nu-
cleation involving organics might be crucial for under-
standing new particle formation in polluted areas of the
globe.
– Characterisation of the chemical composition of the
aerosol at the very early stage of its formation is crit-
ical for identifying the nucleating agents.
3.3
Aerosol dynamics
The ageing and removal of particles from the atmosphere as
well as their climatic impact depends among other parame-
ters on their size distribution that is determined by aerosol
dynamics (the description of the aerosol using size distri-
butions, condensation/evaporation of material, and coagula-
tion). There are few studies evaluating these aspects of OA.
Therefore there is a high degree of uncertainty in the evalua-
tion of the aerosol dynamics of OA.
3.3.1
Size distribution
Various approaches have been developed to represent the size
distribution of aerosols in models:
– the bulk mass approach,
– the sectional approach (e.g. Zhang et al., 2004a; Gel-
bard and Seinfeld, 1980) where the aerosol are usu-
ally assumed internally mixed and properties of the
particles, such as mass and chemical composition, are
assumed uniform within each size bin (Grifﬁn et al.,
2002),
– the modal approach where the size distribution is de-
scribed by several modes, and usually a log-normal dis-
tribution is used to represent the size distribution in each
mode (e.g. Schell et al., 2001; Whitby and McMurry,
1997).
Most of the modelling applications to urban and regional air
quality have focused on aerosol mass distributions whereas
aerosol number distributions have received a minor attention
due to major availability of aerosol mass measurements com-
pared to number concentrations. In most cases the only avail-
able measurements are the total mass of particles smaller
than a certain size (PM2.5 and PM10). Furthermore num-
ber size distributions are more sensitive to dynamic processes
such as coagulation than mass distributions. Based on actual
knowledge, in most global models organic aerosol mass is
assumed to be distributed mainly in the accumulation mode.
3.3.2
Condensation/nucleation
The mass transfer ﬂux (J) of an organic species from the
gas phase to the aerosol phase is proportional to the differ-
ence between its gas-phase concentration, c∞, and equilib-
rium concentration at the particle surface, ceq, (Seinfeld and
Pandis, 1998):
J = 4πRpDif (Kn, a)
 c∞−ceq

(1)
where Rp is the particle radius, Di is the gas-phase diffusiv-
ity. f(Kn, a) is the correction to the mass transfer ﬂux due
to noncontinuum effects and imperfect accommodation, Kn
is the Knudsen number and a is the accommodation coefﬁ-
cient.
The organic vapour condenses onto the particle phase
when c∞>ceq. The equilibrium concentration depends not
only on the properties of the organic species but also on its
ability to form solutions with compounds already present in
the aerosol phase (see next section). Equilibrium tends to
be achieved more quickly for small particles than large ones
(see, for example, Meng and Seinfeld, 1996) and growth of
aerosols occurs on a time scale of minutes to hours.
Koo et al. (2003b) using a one-dimensional Lagrangian
trajectory model have explored whether gas-particle equilib-
rium may be assumed to hold instantaneously or whether
gas-particle mass transfer needs to be treated kinetically.
They found that the equilibrium assumption is valid for the
conditions examined. For global climate applications, be-
cause of the considerably large time steps used, the dynamic
treatment of condensation/evaporation may be avoided and
equilibrium assumed.
However, recent studies show that
other processes, e.g. polymerization (Kalberer et al., 2004;
Tolocka et al., 2004), have a signiﬁcant effect on the compo-
sition and volatility of SOA, which may be more important
than classical microphysical processes and requires investi-
gation.

Coagulation
Coagulation is a function of both the particle number con-
centration and particle size (Seinfeld and Pandis, 1998). The
rate of change of the number concentration of a polydisperse

aerosol due to (Brownian) coagulation depends on the coag-
ulation coefﬁcient k1,2 that can be expressed by
k1,2 = 4π (r1 + r2) (D1 + D2) β
(2)
where D1 and D2 are the particle diffusion coefﬁcients, r1
and r2 the radius of the particles and β is the Fuchs correc-
tion factor (Fuchs, 1964). Coagulation may have an impor-
tant impact on particle number concentration when the con-
centrations are high, i.e. close to emission sources, or may
affect particle mass and chemical composition by internally
mixing particles.
In most urban and regional modelling applications that fo-
cus on aerosol mass distributions, coagulation can be ignored
(Wexler et al., 1994). However, for studies that focus on
aerosol number, and that consider ﬁne mode aerosol distri-
bution, coagulation is one of the most important processes
that reduce aerosol number. So far no study has been done
speciﬁcally on the importance of coagulation on secondary
organic aerosol properties. The importance of coagulation in
transforming insoluble particles into soluble is discussed in
Sect. 5.2.
3.4
Gas-particle partitioning
Semi-volatile VOC oxidation products tend to partition be-
tween the gas and particulate phases. The ambient atmo-
spheric particulate phase will consist, in general, of a mix-
ture of organic and inorganic components, as well as water,
and itself may consist of one or more phases. Organics can
be either in liquid or solid or mixed phase or they may be
dissolved in aqueous solutions. If the aerosol is composed
by more than one phase, it has generally been presumed
that one of the phases is primarily an organic phase and the
other is predominantly an aqueous phase. The basic theory
of equilibrium gas-particle partitioning of a condensable or-
ganic species into an aerosol phase consisting, in general, of
an organic sub-phase and an aqueous sub-phase can be de-
scribed as follows (Grifﬁn et al., 2003).
Let the organic aerosol-phase concentrations of each of
the partitioning secondary organic species be denoted as Oi
(µg m−3 air), i=1,2... , n, where n is the number of parti-
tioning species. The equilibrium organic aerosol-phase par-
titioning coefﬁcient, Kom,i, describes the distribution of each
product between the gas phase and an absorbing organic
aerosol phase. If Gi denotes the gas-phase concentration of
species i(µg m−3 air) and Mo the total mass concentration
(µg m−3 air) of organic aerosol available to act as an organic
medium into which the n species may partition, then
Kom,i =
Oi
MoGi
(3)
where Mo is the sum of all Oi and the mass concentrations
of each primary organic aerosol species present. Gi for each
species is computed from Eq. (3) once the set of Kom,i (m3
air µg−1) values is calculated according to (Pankow, 1994):
Kom,i =
RT
106MWomγipo
L,i
(4)
where
R
is
the
ideal
gas
constant
(8.2×10−5 m3 atm mol−1 K−1), T is temperature (K),
MWom is the average molecular weight (g mol−1) of the
absorbing organics (including both primary organic com-
pounds and secondary products), po
L,i is the pure component
vapour pressure (atm) of species i, and γi is the activity
coefﬁcient of species i in the organic phase. The activity
coefﬁcient γi describes the nonideal interaction between
dissolved species i and the other components of the solution.
A value of γ above 1, for example, means that the compound
in question is not easily miscible with the absorbing aerosol,
and the nonideal interactions favour its remaining in the
gas phase. The factor 106 converts g to µg. The molecular
identities of the condensing and primary non-volatile species
must be known in order to calculate the parameters in
Eq. (4). These include species-speciﬁc molecular weights
and vapour pressures as a function of temperature.
Few experimental values of the vapour pressures of sec-
ondary organic aerosol components exist.
The vapour
pressure of ﬁve mono-carboxylic acids (C14-C18) and two
di-carboxylic acids (glutaric and adipic acid) were mea-
sured by Tao and McMurry (1989) over the temperature
range 283–323 K using a Tandem Differential Mobility An-
alyzer (TDMA) system.
Vapour pressures of the mono-
carboxylic acids were in the range 3×10−7 to 10−4 Pa at
296 K and vapour pressures of the di-carboxylic acids were
8×10−4 and 10−5 Pa for glutaric and adipic acid at 296 K.
Heats of formation were in the range 163–191 kJ mol−1
for the mono-carboxylic acids and 102 and 117 kJ mol−1,
for glutaric and adipic acid, respectively. Additional mea-
surements of the vapour pressures of C3-C9 dicarboxylic
acids were reported by Bilde et al. (2003).
Hallquist et
al. (1997) using a Knudsen effusion apparatus, measured the
vapour pressures of two oxidation products of α-pinene and
13-carene, namely pinonaldehyde and 2,2-dimethyl-3-(2-
oxypropyl)-cyclopropaneacetaldehyde (in the paper referred
to as caronaldehyde), respectively. Vapour pressures were
measured over the temperature range 255–276 K and the val-
ues at 296 K were 4.2 Pa for pinonaldehyde and 2.3 Pa 2,2-
dimethyl-3-(2-oxypropyl)cyclopropane-acetaldehyde. Using
the Tandem Differential Mobility Analysis (TDMA) tech-
nique Bilde and Pandis (2001) measured the vapour pres-
sures of glutaric acid, trans-norpinic acid and pinic acid par-
ticles. Additional measurements of the volatility of the var-
ious SOA components are needed for a comprehensive de-
scription of SOA formation in atmospheric chemical trans-
port models.
The gas-particle partitioning coefﬁcient Kom,i is inversely
proportional to the pure component vapour pressure of

species i. Thus, uncertainties in the value of vapour pres-
sure translate directly into uncertainties in the predicted gas-
particle partitioning.
Species i may also partition to an aqueous particulate
phase. If Ai represents the aqueous-phase concentration of
species i (µg m−3 air) and Hi the Henry’s law coefﬁcient of
species i ((µg µg−1 H2O)/µg m−3 air)):
Ai = Gi(LWC)Hi
γaq,i
,
(5)
where LWC has units of µg H2O m−3 air, and γaq,i is the
activity coefﬁcient of organic species iin the aqueous phase
(normalized by that at inﬁnite dilution).
The aqueous-phase equilibrium is also subject to con-
straints imposed by dissociation of the dissolved organic
species. The degree of dissociation of the organics that one
encounters in the aerosol phase is variable. The dissociation
of most dicarboxylic acids (with the exception of oxalic acid)
and of most large acids can be neglected. For the few small
acids like formic and acetic acid this has to be taken into
consideration. Note the general lack of experimental data on
combinatory reactions between organic anions and inorganic
electrolytes in the aqueous phase for the compounds of inter-
est as SOA.
Both the organic and aqueous phase equilibrium relations
require activity coefﬁcients, γi and γaq,i (see paramaterisa-
tion proposed by Bowman and Karamalegos, 2002). An it-
erative solution to determine the organic- and aqueous-phase
equilibrium concentrations is necessary because activity co-
efﬁcients are themselves a function of composition. This so-
lution must also satisfy mass conservation: the sum of the
values for Oi, Gi, Ai, AMi,and ADi must equal the total
amount of i available, where AMi and ADi are the concen-
tration of singly and of the doubly (when applicable) charged
ion from species i, respectively (details are given in Grifﬁn
et al., 2003).
3.5
Representation of SOA formation in Atmospheric
Chemistry Transport Models
The representation of gas-phase VOC oxidation chemistry
that leads to SOA formation in current Atmospheric Chem-
istry Transport Models generally falls into one of three cate-
gories:
1. Use of empirical data ﬁts derived from laboratory cham-
ber data;
2. Use of completely explicit gas-phase oxidation for the
VOCs in question to predict the spectrum of condensing
products;
3. Use of lumped gas-phase oxidation mechanisms derived
from simpliﬁcation of fully explicit mechanisms.
The purpose of the mechanisms in points (2) and (3) above
is to predict condensable products from gas-phase oxidation
of the parent VOC.
The formation of SOA from a particular VOC is often de-
scribed in terms of the fractional mass yield, Y, which re-
lates how much particulate matter is produced when a certain
amount of parent gaseous VOC is oxidized:
Y =
Mo
1V OC ,
(6)
where Mo (µg m−3) is the mass concentration of SOA pro-
duced from the reaction of 1VOC (µg m−3).
Two product yield method. Odum et al. (1996) utilized
the concepts of multicomponent gas-particle partitioning to
develop a framework for parameterising the trend of increas-
ing Y values with increasing Mo for chamber experiments
involving water-dry aerosols. Assuming that the photooxi-
dation of a parent VOC can be represented as leading to just
two overall semi-volatile products P1 and P2, then
V OC + oxidants →p1P1 + p2P2 + volatile products
(7)
where p1 and p2 are molar stoichiometric coefﬁcients. Re-
action (7) does not represent a fundamental reaction but
rather a convenient way to represent observed data. Then
α1=p1×MWP1/MWVOC and α2=p2×MWP2/MWVOC are
the mass stoichiometric factors for the production of P1and
P2 from the parent hydrocarbon (VOC) with MWP 1, MWP 2
and MWV OC the molecular weights of P1, P2 and VOC, re-
spectively (Seinfeld and Pankow, 2003).
Using the mass-based stoichiometric coefﬁcients, αi, the
result for the overall yield Y is:
Y =
X
i
Yi =
X
i
αi

Kom,iMo
1 + Kom,iMo

(8)
where Yi is the individual contribution to the yield from com-
pound i.
The above framework has been used extensively in
analysing yield data for laboratory smog chamber experi-
ments conducted in the absence of water, for a wide range
of parent VOC compounds. Each of those experiments has
been described by ﬁtting the Y versus Mo data by assuming
that two hypothetical average product compounds, P1 and P2,
were formed. Yield data are not generally ﬁt well by assum-
ing a single product, and the assumption of three products
does not improve the ﬁts signiﬁcantly. In a two-product ﬁt
(i=2), there are four ﬁtting parameters: two αi values and
two Kom,i values and are used to ﬁt a monotonically increas-
ing curve that goes through zero. This method provides a
good ﬁt under the studied experimental conditions however
its applicability to different conditions requires to be care-
fully checked.
The empirical two-product representation of SOA forma-
tion has been highly successful in ﬁtting laboratory SOA
yield data at the California Institute of Technology for over

50 parent VOCs (Odum et al., 1997; Grifﬁn et al. 1999a).
Even though its simplicity and its basis in actual laboratory
data are strong points, the approach suffers disadvantages for
use in atmospheric models. It is well established that, even
for a single VOC, many more than two products are involved
in SOA formation and, as conditions such as temperature
and oxidant level change, a different distribution of prod-
ucts might be condensing than those on which the original
correlation was based. Laboratory experiments have gener-
ally been carried out in a modest temperature range around
298 K. At temperatures of the upper troposphere, oxidation
products that might otherwise remain largely or wholly in the
gas phase around 298 K may shift to the SOA phase. Such
behaviour cannot be captured by a two-component model de-
rived on the basis of higher temperature chamber data.
Detailed chemical mechanisms. The approach to the gas-
phase modelling step of SOA formation that is at least in
principle most chemically rigorous is to represent the gas-
phase chemistry with a fully explicit mechanism. An exam-
ple of such a mechanism is the University of Leeds Master
Chemical Mechanism version 3.0 (MCM v3) (http://www.
chem.leeds.uk/Atmospheric/MCM/mcmproj.html). The use
of a chemically explicit mechanism could impart a degree of
conﬁdence when all conceivable important chemical paths
have supposedly been accounted for and have been carefully
evaluated against measurements. Unfortunately this is not
the case of SOA forming chemical mechanisms since the
rate constants of many among the involved reactions have
not been determined in the laboratoty. While such a detailed
mechanism is important for evaluating the extent of agree-
ment of predictions of a chemically explicit mechanism with
chamber data, the computations associated with using such a
mechanism in a regional or global atmospheric model render
it completely impractical.
Recently, Jenkin (2004) has summarized actual knowledge
on the α- and β- pinene ozonolysis in the MCM v3 mecha-
nism. He considered equilibrium absorptive partitioning of a
total of about 200 semivolatile products and has been able to
reasonably describe the SOA accumulation when substantial
SOA mass was already present and the partitioning coefﬁ-
cients of the semivolatiles have been increased by 2 orders of
magnitude compared with those based on estimated vapour
pressures. The consideration of the gas phase production and
subsequent transfer to the aerosol phase of involatile dimers
of 22 bi- and multifunctional carboxylic acids in the MCM v3
allowed the description of the early stages SOA formation i.e.
at low mass concentrations. This mechanism has been eval-
uated against some chamber experiments with regard to the
SOA mass accumulation. The computed SOA mass consists
in majority from multifunctional acid products and increas-
ing contributions from more volatile products, like pinon-
aldehyde and nopinone, with increasing aerosol mass.
Regional or tropospheric-scale ozone chemistry is typi-
cally represented by lumped mechanisms, those in which
reactions of similar type are grouped together or in which
the chemistry of certain species is used to represent that of a
wide spectrum of related species. The mechanisms have been
tested to insure they exhibit the proper response of calculated
O3 concentrations to changes in key variables, such as NOx
level.
Signiﬁcant deviations between gas phase chemical
mechanisms in the calculated NO2 and organic peroxy rad-
icals concentrations are encountered when comparing them
under high NOx conditions due to the different simpliﬁcation
of the organic peroxy radical chemistry (Gross and Stock-
well, 2003; P¨oschl et al., 2000). In addition, such evaluations
are limited by the experimental data on which the chemical
mechanisms rely. As discussed in Sect. 3.1 ozonolysis ex-
periments might be biased by OH formation in the cham-
ber and have been performed in the absence of NO, thus
neglecting reaction of products with NO that can be of at-
mospheric relevance. Similarly, NO3 chamber experiments
are performed under very high NOx levels that block ‘clean’
chemistry pathways (like permutation reactions and hydro-
genperoxide formation paths).
Although signiﬁcant advances have been made in under-
standing the SOA formation, targeted chamber and ﬁeld ex-
periments are needed to allow evaluation and provide conﬁ-
dence to chemical mechanisms used in regional and global
models that treat both gas phase chemistry and SOA forma-
tion. Approaches based on lumped mechanisms are just start-
ing to emerge in regional/global modelling of SOA (see, for
example, Grifﬁn et al., 2002a), and it is this direction that
offers the most promise for development of chemically real-
istic models of SOA formation in the next ten years or so.
The gas-phase chemical mechanism predicts the amounts of
oxidation products; the next step is to partition those products
between the gas and aerosol phases. First, it is generally es-
tablished that such products will tend to partition themselves
between the gas and particulate phases in accord with the
equilibrium relations discussed in Section 3.4. But several
questions arise:
1. What is the nature of the particles to which the con-
densable species are partitioning? Does primary organic
aerosol also act as an absorbing medium in addition to
the already-condensed SOA? Is liquid water in the par-
ticles present as a separate aqueous phase into which
gaseous oxidation products may also dissolve? To what
extent does the presence of the condensed SOA induce
the further condensation of water?
2. Is gas-aerosol equilibrium for the condensing organic
species established rapidly or are the kinetics of con-
densation/evaporation important?
3. Are aerosol-phase reactions occurring involving the
condensing SOA products?
SOA in global models. Consideration of the OA in regional
modelling has started in the 80s with pioneering work by Pili-
nis et al. (1987). Since then a lot of progress has been made

M. Kanakidou et al.: Organic aerosol and global climate modelling
in regional/urban modelling of SOA whereas only recently
a few global modelling efforts have emerged.
Generally,
because of computational considerations, the urban/regional
models include a more detailed representation of SOA for-
mation than do the global models. This is reﬂected both in
the size of the gas-phase VOC oxidation mechanism and in
the level of detail in the gas-particle partitioning calculation.
In global models, because of the considerably larger time
steps, the equilibrium assumption appears to be valid (Koo
et al., 2003b). This outcome is fortuitous because it is un-
likely that global models could accommodate the signiﬁcant
computational burden associated with a kinetic calculation of
gas-particle partitioning of SOA components.
There exist two sensitivity studies of SOA modelling, one
on regional scale (Pun et al., 2003) and the second on global
scale (Tsigaridis and Kanakidou, 2003), both of which illus-
trate the wide degree of variation in predicted SOA depend-
ing on the actual model used or on assumptions made about
the gas-particle partitioning process. Pun et al. (2003) in-
vestigated differences among three SOA modules caused by
the representation of terpenes, the mechanistic versus empir-
ical representation of SOA-forming reactions, the identities
of SOA, and the parameters used in the gas/particle parti-
tioning calculations. Tsigaridis and Kanakidou (2003) in-
vestigated differences caused by the assumptions in the pa-
rameters used for the gas/particle partitioning calculations,
in the primary emissions of POA and in the hydrophobic to
hydrophilic conversion.
Table 5 presents a summary of the recent global modelling
studies that include SOA and their main assumptions. The
models in this table follow rather different approaches; they
assume different substrates for the condensation of SOA as
well as the surrogate VOC compounds considered to form
SOA precursors and have different treatment of the evapo-
ration. They also differ in the consideration or not of pri-
mary carbonaceous aerosol and in the amount of it that is
being emitted into the atmosphere. To these conceptual par-
ticularities of the models, more generally applied technical
differences are added. For instance, models differ in the spa-
tial and temporal resolutions, the parameterisations and input
data used to represent transport and wet deposition processes.
Therefore, global SOA formation estimates vary by almost a
factor of 6 between about 12 and 70 Tg-SOA y−1. This re-
ﬂects the uncertainty in our current understanding of the SOA
occurrence in the global troposphere.
One draws the following conclusions concerning the treat-
ment of SOA in global models:
– Use of detailed gas-phase VOC oxidation mechanisms
is not currently feasible in global atmospheric mod-
els. At the other extreme, however, laboratory cham-
ber studies have not been carried out over a sufﬁcient
parameter range to provide entirely empirically-based
representations of SOA formation. A need exists to de-
velop robust, lumped mechanisms capable of represent-
ing the generation of condensable products.
– The gas-particle partitioning is among the key pro-
cesses.
It cannot simply be assumed that all semi-
volatile products condense entirely or that they always
condense in the same proportion regardless of condi-
tions. Therefore, it is necessary to represent the details
of gas-particle partitioning in global models. Condens-
able SOA products will dissolve in both organic and
aqueous aerosol phases, and the organic phase can con-
sist of primary organic aerosol as well as condensed
SOA itself. Since the nature of the aerosol phase is im-
portant in this partitioning, it will be necessary to ac-
count for the presence of primary organics as well as
inorganics that govern the amount of condensed water
in the global model.
– The extent to which heterogeneous aerosol chemistry
is important in SOA formation is currently unknown.
The effect of heterogeneous reactions is to form larger
molecules through addition reactions; such molecules
have signiﬁcantly lower vapour pressures than the ad-
dition partners, essentially freezing these molecules in
the aerosol phase (i.e. increasing Kom). At present, not
enough is known about such chemistry to include it ex-
plicitly in global SOA models; based on recent cham-
ber results it may be possible to estimate its importance
through sensitivity studies.

Removal of organic aerosols
4.1
Dry deposition of aerosols in climate models
Dry deposition of aerosols is a signiﬁcant removal process
close to the ground. Models calculate the dry deposition ﬂux
F by assuming that it is directly proportional to the concen-
tration C of the deposited species:
F = −udC
(9)
The dry deposition velocity ud, is calculated based on the
electrical resistance analogy. According to this, the deposited
species has to overcome three resistances connected in se-
ries prior to deposition: the aerodynamic resistance ra, the
quasi-laminar layer resistance rb and the canopy resistance
rc. The aerodynamic resistance is controlled by the turbu-
lent transport of the species from the atmosphere close to the
surface, while the quasi-laminar resistance depends on the
molecular properties of the deposited species and the surface
characteristics. The canopy resistance is controlled greatly
by the surface characteristics, since the species are assumed
deposited only if they cannot escape back to the atmosphere
after the direct contact with the surface. For aerosol species,
the canopy resistance is equal to zero, since it is generally
assumed that whenever a particle reaches the surface it has

found elsewhere (e.g. Seinfeld and Pandis, 1998; Wesely and
Hicks, 2000).
The most critical factor controlling the dry deposition ve-
locity of aerosols is the particle size, aerosol mass density
being the second factor affecting sedimentation of the larger
particles. Very small particles behave much like gases, mak-
ing turbulent transport and Brownian diffusion the most ef-
ﬁcient removal pathways from the atmosphere, while large
particles, due to their weight, the settle to the surface due to
gravity, with a gravitational settling velocity ug. Medium-
sized particles do not have a very efﬁcient removal path-
way, and have the longest lifetimes concerning dry deposi-
tion. The deposition velocity of particles is calculated based
on the following equation:
ud =
 ra + rb + rarbug
−1 + ug
(10)
In order to calculate the dry deposition velocity of organic
aerosols in climate models, the aerodynamic and the quasi-
laminar layer resistances need to be calculated directly from
the climate routines of the models. The aerodynamic resis-
tance is calculated by integrating the micrometeorological
conditions of the lower model layer, such as the momen-
tum, the eddy diffusivity and the friction velocity. The model
layer thickness is also taken into account. The aerosol quasi-
laminar layer resistance calculation is based on the Brownian
diffusion, while the gravitational settling velocity is calcu-
lated using Stokes Law. More details on these calculations
can be found in Seinfeld and Pandis (1998).
The evaluation of dry deposition removal of aerosols in the
models remains quite uncertain since it would require eddy-
correlation measurements of carbonaceous aerosols which to
our knowledge do not exist at present.
As explained above dry deposition gains importance as a
loss process for aerosol with increasing particle size since
gravitational sedimentation is applicable to coarse particles.
In the accumulation range (particles smaller than 2.5 µm)
where most OA components seem to be present, it is mainly
the wet removal that determines the removal of OA from the
atmosphere.
4.2
Wet scavenging of organic aerosols
Aerosol is scavenged both in-cloud and below-cloud. The
wet scavenging of all aerosols depends on large-scale fea-
tures such as cloud formation, the conversion of cloud
droplets into rain drops, sedimentation and evaporation of
rain. Globally, 50–60% of the earth is covered by clouds, but
only 10% of the clouds are rain clouds. Roelofs et al. (2001)
showed that the treatment of wet scavenging was the largest
source of uncertainty in global models of the sulphur cy-
cle. Likewise it is expected that wet scavenging of organic
aerosol is highly important. In addition to large scale cloud
and rain processes, the wet-scavenging also depends on mi-
crophysical properties of the aerosol, determining its ability
to get included in cloud and rain droplets.
The most important process by which organic aerosol
mass is scavenged is formation and removal of cloud con-
densation nuclei. The K¨ohler equation describes the aerosol

nucleation process (K¨ohler, 1936; Shulman et al., 1996; Se-
infeld and Pandis, 1998).
Other processes include diffu-
sion scavenging by activated raindrops and impaction by hy-
drometeors either in the solid phase (ice and snow) or liq-
uid phase.
In addition, cloud droplets can be intercepted
by larger falling raindrops.
All the scavenging processes
mentioned above will reduce aerosol number concentrations.
This decrease in aerosol numbers is particularly efﬁcient for
the accumulation mode.
The entrainment of air in clouds occurs very differently de-
pending on the cloud type: large scale or convective. In the
case of convective clouds, air is either entrained at the basis
of cloud either between the base and the top through mul-
tiple entrainment-detrainment entry points along the tower
of the updraft. Whether the aerosol is scavenged by aerosol
nucleation or by impaction below cloud from the falling hy-
drometeors, it is relevant to measure whether the aerosol is in
the liquid phase in clouds or in the interstitial air. The parti-
tioning of organics compounds between cloud water and in-
terstitial air in cloud was investigated among others by Fac-
chini et al. (1999a) who concluded that polar soluble com-
pounds were most likely found in fog droplets whereas in-
soluble compounds remained in interstitial air.
Puxbaum and Limbeck (2000) have measured the scav-
enging efﬁciency of different organic compounds at Mt
Sonnblick, Austria. Their measurements stress the important
role of the polarity in determining the efﬁciency with which
organic compounds are uptaken in cloud droplets (see also
Facchini et al., 1999b). Dicarboxylic acids are the most efﬁ-
cient class of organics to be scavenged, with efﬁciency com-
parable to that of sulphate. The ratio of the concentration
in cloud droplets to the sum of the concentrations in droplets
and in interstitial air was measured as 0.8. For aromatic com-
pounds the same ratio was 0.6, intermediate between non-
polar alcohols and slightly polar monocarboxylic acids for
which about 40% of the molecules were measured in cloud
water.
Hallberg et al. (1992) studied the unscavenged fraction of
aerosol in fog droplets. The fraction of elemental carbon was
found to be signiﬁcantly more abundant than for sulfate. The
study could not determine whether chemical composition or
size distribution was the decisive factor in controlling this
difference. A further study (Hallberg et al., 1994a) com-
pared, respectively, soluble, insoluble and soluble with insol-
uble inclusions aerosol of the same size. Amongst the par-
ticles that formed cloud droplets most of them were shown
to be soluble. When the partitioning of aerosol particles be-
tween cloud droplets and interstitial air was compared dur-
ing 2 periods of a ﬁeld experiment, the scavenging efﬁciency
decreased with increasing aerosol loads in the accumulation
mode, (Hallberg et al., 1994b). Two processes could explain
the size partitionning of aerosols between cloud droplets and
interstitial air: the speed of the cloud updaft and/or the dif-
ference in particle chemical composition.
The efﬁciency of aerosol scavenged by snow or ice is par-
ticularly uncertain.
The interception of aerosols by snow
ﬂakes is linked to their shape (see Slinn, 1984 and Hegg et
al., 1989). Dendritic shapes and riming snow ﬂakes will ef-
ﬁciently collect aerosols. Capture of aerosols by snow and
ice is still poorly described in general circulation models. It
follows that the column loads and aerosol vertical distribu-
tions at high latitudes are poorly represented in these mod-
els. Only a model that predicts the shape of the snow ﬂakes
can account for the widely varying efﬁciency of collection of
the aerosol by snow ﬂakes (Jacobson, 2003). Hegg (2001)
discusses the efﬁcient scavenging of aerosols in mixed phase
clouds. Since hydrophobic aerosols are efﬁcient ice nuclei
their scavenging by mixed phase clouds is favoured.
In summary, the high uncertainty in the wet-scavenging of
organic aerosol in climate models is related
– to uncertainties in the description of large scale cloud
and rain formation processes, and
– to intrinsic uncertainties in the detailed description of
the role of organic aerosol in micro-physical cloud and
rain processes.
4.3
Lifetime of carbonaceous aerosols
The lifetime of carbonaceous aerosols driven by wet and dry
deposition depends on the afﬁnity for water of the aerosols
(whether they are hydrophobic or hydrophilic, see discussion
in Sect. 5). The main sink process for these aerosols is wet
deposition which represents 70 to 85% of the total sink for
these species; the other remaining sink is dry deposition.
The
AEROCOM
intercomparison
(http://nansen.ipsl.
jussieu.fr/AEROCOM/ global aerosol model intercompar-
ison) that includes the results of 16 global models which
represent the main aerosol components showed a range of
lifetimes of organic aerosol from 4.3 to 11.1 days with 13
out of these 16 models lying between 5.4 and 8.1 days.
The main cause for the variations of aerosol lifetime is the
spatial (latitude and altitude) and temporal variation of the
precipitation and the vicinity of surfaces for dry deposition.
Integrated monthly, the latitudinal variations in lifetime can
be as large as a factor of 4 (Balkanski et al., 1993). The
variations with altitude are of similar importance since for an
aerosol produced in the ﬁrst kilometer of the troposphere the
globally mean lifetime is of approximately 4 days whereas
when the aerosol is formed at 10 km its lifetime increases to
12 days (Balkanski, 1991).

Conversion of hydrophobic to hydrophilic aerosol
Both chemical and physical ageing processes can lead to an
increase in hygroscopicity. Chemical ageing is the chemical
modiﬁcation of the aerosol components due to heterogeneous
and liquid phase reactions which may change chain length,

functional groups, thereby modifying the hygroscopicity of
the particles. Physical ageing is due to mixing processes such
as coagulation and condensation adding more soluble mate-
rial and thereby increasing the over-all solubility and hygro-
scopicity of the particles. The aerosol ageing that converts
the hydrophobic to hydrophilic particles is a key process de-
termining the wet removal (see Sect. 4) and hence the res-
idence time and atmospheric burden of carbonaceous parti-
cles in the atmosphere.
There is evidence, from in-situ measurements (e.g. Ogren
et al. 1984) that anthropogenic carbonaceous aerosol com-
ponents typically have a longer residence time in the atmo-
sphere than water-soluble aerosol components such as sul-
phate. Additionally, black carbon which is a component of
anthropogenic carbonaceous aerosol is insoluble and inert,
yet it is known to be wet deposited. Finally, wet deposition
is the dominant process for removing water-soluble aerosols
from the entire tropospheric column.
Consequently, sev-
eral models of the black carbon aerosol cycle (e.g. Cooke
and Wilson, 1996; Cooke et al., 1999; Myhre et al., 1998;
Wilson et al., 2001) have proposed that some or all of the
primary emissions of black carbon with associated organic
compounds to be hydrophobic and thus not wet deposited,
but converting to a hydrophilic, wet depositing form with
time. This approach was found to improve the agreement
between modelled and observed black carbon concentrations
at remote surface stations.
In this section we discuss ﬁrst the major mixing processes
and their respective timescales by which non-hygroscopic
particles are converted into hygroscopic ones and then out-
line actual knowledge on chemical processes that modify the
hygroscopic properties of the aerosols.
The following questions need to be addressed:
– What have we learned from measurements of the hygro-
scopicity of freshly emitted/formed carbonaceous parti-
cles (engine combustion, biomass burning, secondary
organic aerosol from anthropogenic/biogenic precur-
sors) and aged (accumulation mode) particles?
– For modelling purposes, can we deﬁne a “reference hy-
groscopicity” which deﬁnes the transition between hy-
drophobic and hygroscopic particles, the latter being af-
fected by wet deposition processes and leading to cloud
formation?
– What are the processes and time scales converting hy-
drophobic to hydrophilic particles?
5.1
Effect of ageing on hygroscopicity
Fossil fuel as well as biomass burning carbonaceous aerosol
immediately after emission is more hydrophobic, becoming
more hygroscopic with time.
The picture emerging from
the ‘real-world’ data is that in trafﬁc-dominated conditions
(street canyon and urban background), a signiﬁcant fraction

Wilson (1996) scheme; Lohmann et al. (1999) used the Cooke et

of the ageing rate constant and corresponds to the time needed to
convert 63% of the fresh-hydrophobic aerosol hygroscopic.
of less hydroscopic particles is quasi permanently observed.
This fraction decreases with increasing particle size for a
given urban site. The fraction of occurrence of these less
hygroscopic particles decreases when moving from the ur-
ban background (0.35–1) to continental sites (0.01–0.35) of
time), down to 0 in remote marine locations. Simultaneously,
a population of more hygroscopic particles is always present.
(Weingartner et al., 1997; Pagels et al., 2003; Marelli et al.,
2003). The concept of a single turnover time from hydropho-
bic to hydrophilic, can thus describe scale changes from ur-
ban to background, or from street canyon to urban, while not
necessarily being applicable to the entire spatial scale.
A key issue is nevertheless to evaluate the turn-over time
converting particles into hygroscopic ones. Presently, most
models are applying ﬁrst order conversion kinetics of hy-
drophobic to hygroscopic BC and OC with turn over time
equal to 0.7–1.2 days (see Table 6), but are also varying
the fraction of primary emissions that are assumed to be hy-
drophobic in order to arrive at realistic BC and OC burdens.
An important question to address is: which soluble frac-
tion in a mixed particle is needed in order to make a “hy-
drophobic” particle “hygroscopic”?
Applying the K¨ohler
equations (see Appendix A), Pruppacher and Klett (1980)
obtained a relation between particle radius, critical supersat-
uration and soluble fraction for mixed particles consisting of
an insoluble core and given fraction of a soluble salt. The

This equation has been used hereafter to derive the amount
of soluble mass that has to be “acquired” by an insoluble
particle in order to become a cloud condensation nucleus at
0.2% and 0.3% supersaturation, respectively. The thus calcu-
lated soluble fraction (soluble/(soluble + insoluble)) required
for an initially insoluble particle to become a CCN at 0.2
and 0.3% supersaturation respectively is depicted in Fig. 4.
Due to the competing Kelvin and Raoult terms in the K¨ohler
equation, small particles have to acquire more soluble ma-
terial relative to their mass than larger ones. However, the
required soluble mass per particle is relatively insensitive to
the diameter of the initial insoluble particle.
The occurrence of distinct hygroscopicity modes has been
investigated and explained by Kerminen (1997), who pro-
poses cloud-processing as the major process adding soluble
material to cloud-activated particles and creating a ‘more hy-
groscopic’ particle after as few as 2 cloud cycles. A par-
ticle can be considered as ‘more hygroscopic’ and subject
to efﬁcient wet deposition once it has become a CCN. Ker-
minen (1997) argued that coagulation and condensation can
not explain the formation of clearly separated hygroscopic-
ity modes. However, they are the main processes that can
transform a non-CCN into CCN through the mixing between
hydrophobic and soluble material, heterogeneous reactions
onto aerosol surfaces being an alternative of not yet quanti-
ﬁed importance. Neglecting such reactions, the timescales
for mixing by condensation of soluble species (sulphate, ni-
trate, MSA) and coagulation of insoluble with soluble par-
ticles (sea-salt, aged sulphate-rich accumulation mode parti-
cles) are the ones that will determine the residence time of
hydrophobic carbonaceous particles in the atmosphere.
5.2
Removal of insoluble aerosol by coagulation
Where fresh hydrophobic carbonaceous particles are formed
co-incident with high concentrations of gaseous precursors
and photochemical conversion, “Condensation” is likely to
be efﬁcient, although in sufﬁciently high concentrations of
gaseous precursors the ageing of hydrophobic particles may
also occur through secondary particle formation and coagula-
tion. The presence of a high concentration of pre-existing ac-
cumulation mode particles however, scavenges an important
fraction of the condensable material and delays the growth
of the hydrophobic particles. Hence, there is competition
between coagulation, condensation and heterogeneous reac-
tions on aerosol surfaces as ageing processes, depending on
the magnitude of the accumulation mode, the availability of
condensable species, the chemical properties of the particle
surface and the oxidant levels. These different regimes can
be investigated by ﬁeld and model studies.

Fig. 4. Soluble fraction to be acquired by initially insoluble par-
ticles in order to become CCN at 0.2% and 0.3% supersaturation
respectively, as a function of the insoluble particle diameter (apply-
ing the K¨ohler equations).
In the absence of high concentrations of gaseous precur-
sors, coagulation is the more important conversion process.
Where large concentrations of more-hygroscopic accumu-
lation mode particles are present, freshly formed carbona-
ceous particles will be scavenged by these, without signiﬁ-
cant changes in the hygroscopicity of the pre-existing, parti-
cles. Where the pre-existing particles are smaller Nucleation
or Aitken mode particles then, the hygroscopicity of the co-
agulated particles may indeed change.
Modelling studies have focussed on coagulation as a major
process leading to mixed, more hygroscopic particles (Str¨om
et al., 1992; Fassi-Fihri et al., 1997). Riemer et al. (2003)
modelled explicitly the mixing between soot and soluble salts
by coagulation and condensation in a 3-D case study over
Germany and obtained a 2 hour turn-over time for soot during
day-time (dominated by condensation) and a 20 h turn-over
time during the night (dominated by coagulation). Wehner et
al. (2002) applied a simple model with condensation, coagu-
lation and entrainment with background and freshly emitted
urban aerosol to successfully explain the transition of a street
canyon aerosol size distribution to urban background on a
time scale of less than 1 h.
The time scales for mixing between fresh hydrophobic
particles and hygroscopic material by condensation and co-
agulation can be investigated relatively simply for various
conditions. Here we examine the coagulation between pre-
existing accumulation mode particles and fresh carbonaceous
particles in order to provide an upper limit to the turn over
time, and compare that with condensation as a lower. The
case of coagulation with smaller freshly formed soluble par-
ticles, will fall between these two. According to the K¨ohler
equation, the critical diameter for an ammonium sulphate
particle at 0.2% supersaturation (SS) is equal to 80 nm, coag-

with k12 the effective coagulation coefﬁcient between hy-
drophobic and hygroscopic accumulation mode particles,
and Nacc the number concentration in the accumulation
mode. τCOA is the time needed to coagulate 63% of the hy-
drophobic particles. We assume here that the mixing process
reduces the number of hydrophobic particles without chang-
ing the number of hydrophilic ones. It does not convert hy-
drophobic to hydrophilic with regard to the aerosol number
concentration.
The characteristic time for internal mixing by condensa-
tion depends on the source rate of the condensing species
(e.g. H2SO4), on the scavenging rate by the background (ac-
cumulation mode) aerosol, and on the size of the initial hy-
drophobic particles. Assuming that the partitioning of the

A proper evaluation of τ requires a consistent application
of values for SO2 and Nacc, which obviously depend strongly
on the type of location.
Figure 5 shows τ as a function
of Nacc (hygroscopic accumulation mode) for various SO2
concentrations and initial properties of hydrophobic particles
with initial diameter Dhf =50 nm and Nhf =1000 cm−3. Typ-
ical [SO2, Nacc] ranges for marine to urban conditions are
indicated on the graphs. It appears that, in urban and near-
city conditions, τ is completely controlled by coagulation,
whatever the SO2 concentration, with turn-over times from
minutes to some hours. Smaller particles have a shorter life-
time for otherwise identical conditions.
In the coagulation-controlled regime, τ is independent of
Nhf . This is the case for all situations in Fig. 6 that shows
that this turn-over time could be strongly reduced (conden-
sation – controlled) if higher SO2 concentrations (or other
soluble, condensable material) prevailed. The turn-over time
for marine conditions is of the order of several days to weeks.
This would, e.g. apply to particles from ship emissions,
which can survive for long time.
The turn-over times for rural and near-city conditions cor-
respond to the ageing rates applied in the models cited above.
However, most of the trafﬁc and industrial related emissions
are conﬁned to the urban environment where a fast initial
ageing phase takes place. Hence, some hours after emission
when the urban plume starts to disperse on regional scale,
most of the conversion has already happened.
5.3
Chemical ageing of aerosols
As above mentioned, conversion of hydrophobic to hygro-
scopic particles can also occur via chemical ageing i.e. het-
erogeneous chemical reactions on the surface of the parti-
cles. These reactions can alter the chemical composition of
the particles forming for instance more polar, hygroscopic
products than the precursor particulate material. The under-
standing and the documentation of these processes is actually
in its infancy.
Rudich (2003) has published a comprehensive review of
some of the laboratory studies that have been conducted the
last years to characterize the chemical processing of organic
aerosol. Since then more thorough studies have been per-
formed particularly on the reactions of ozone and OH with
organic surfaces and aerosols, most notably on oleic acid
aerosol particles and multicomponent particles. These stud-
ies used well-deﬁned laboratory models to identify the ki-
netics, reaction mechanisms and implications for the CCN
activity of organic aerosols (Moise and Rudich, 2002; Smith
et al., 2002; 2003; Katrib et al., 2004; Vieceli et al., 2004;
Molina et al., 2004).
R¨ompp et al. (20051) suggested that oxidation of linear di-
carboxylic acids (C9-C11) by OH-radicals yields various iso-
1 R¨ompp, A., Winterhalter, R., Berresheim, H., and Moortgat,
G. K.: Oxodicarboxylic acids in atmospheric aerosol, Atmos. Env-
iron., submitted, 2005.
mers of oxodicarboxylic acids. The oxidation occurs in the
particle phase. The formed acids are more polar and hygro-
scopic than the parent dicarboxylic acids. The ratio of ox-
odicarboxylic acids to the parent dicarboxylic acid measured
in aerosol ﬁeld samples at two locations in Europe showed
good correlation with OH-radical concentrations.
Ozone reactions with organic particulate mater in the form
of soot or organic acid ﬁlms or organic aerosols have been
shown to alter the chemical properties of the aerosol sur-
faces. Chughtai et al. (1999) found that surface oxidation of
soot by reaction with O3 increases the hydration of the par-
ticles. Studies of diesel particles coated by benzo(a)pyrene
(BaP) have demonstrated that during exposure to O3 the par-
ticles become more hydrophilic (Weingartner et al., 1997;
Kotzick and Niessner, 1999) with a rate (r) that depends on
the O3 levels. The presence of H2O serves as an inhibitor
by competitive adsorption on the soot active sites. P¨oschl et
al. (2001) based on laboratory experiments have proposed a
pseudo-ﬁrst-order decay rate coefﬁcient (r) for BaP reaction
with O3 that depends on ozone concentrations, the adsorption
rate coefﬁcient of O3 that serves as the oxidation medium
and the adsorption rate coefﬁcient of H2O that serves as an
inhibitor by competitive adsorption.
Based on that parameterisation, Tsigaridis and Kanaki-
dou (2003) tentatively calculated a chemical turn-over time
for the conversion of hydrophobic soot coated by BaP to hy-
drophilic that varies spatially due to the O3 and water vapour
variability from a few hours to about 10 days with a mean tro-
pospheric value of about a day. This has to be viewed with
caution since not all soot is coated by BaP and other hetero-
geneous reactions might take place on soot and be respon-
sible for chemical conversion of hydrophobic to hydrophilic
aerosol in the atmosphere.
Moise and Rudich (2002) detected aldehydes as the major
volatile product of reactions of O3with aerosols with a fatty
acid component. Eliason et al. (2003) found that ozonoly-
sis of long chain unsaturated carboxylic (fatty) acids leads to
smaller molecules of higher hygroscopicity (mainly aldehy-
des and carboxylic acids) that can stay in the aerosol phase
or escape to the atmosphere (Eliason et al., 2003, 2004).
Molina et al. (2004) investigated the OH-initiated oxida-
tion of solid organics in the presence of O2, NOx and H2O
and detected small gas phase products including CO, CO2,
CH2O, CH3CHO, CH3OH, and HCOOH that escape from
the aerosol phase by volatilisation. However, acid-catalysed
heterogeneous reactions of aldehydes on diesel soot might in-
crease the aerosol mass by making them less volatile but the
overall modiﬁcation of the hygroscopic properties of the re-
sulting organic material will depend on the oxidation mech-
anism. Hydration, hemiacetal and acetal formation, poly-
merization and aldol condensation have been proposed as
potential mechanisms to explain the observed acid-catalysed
heterogeneous reactions of organic mater (Jang et al., 2003;
Iinuma et al., 2004).

Katrib et al. (2004) suggest new reaction pathways for the
formation of large molecular weight products in the ozonol-
ysis reactions of oleic acid. This new reaction pathway in-
volves reactions of Criegee intermediates in the condensed
phase with aldehydes, ketones and alkenes and it does not
involve acidity. Kawamura et al. (1995, 1996, 2005) and
Narukawa et al. (2003) provide experimental evidence that
Br chemistry in the Arctic transforms unsaturated diacids
to smaller saturated acids. Ozonolysis of oleic and linoleic
acid is shown to contribute to activation of particles to cloud
droplets (Broekhuizen et al., 2005). Reactions of OH, NO3,
Cl and Br radicals with organic layers have been found
to change the hygroscopicity of the surfaces as measured
by contact angle and microbalance methods (Demou et al.,
2003; Eliason et al., 2003; Rudich et al., 2000; Moise and
Rudich, 2001).
– These heterogeneous reactions modify the aerosol mass
and its hygroscopic properties and affect the gas phase
chemistry in the atmosphere.
– The consideration of such reactions in global climate
models is crucial for the better representation of the age-
ing of aerosols and of their ability to act as CCN but
requires a better than the actual understanding of the
mechanisms involved.
In addition to these mechanisms, chemical ageing of aerosols
occurs during cloud processing of particles, relevant knowl-
edge is summarized in the next section.
Recently, Maria
et al. (2004) on the basis of observational growth rates of
atmospheric particles, evaluated that consideration of such
surface- and volume- limited chemical reactions should in-
crease the carbonaceous particle burdens in climate models
by 70%.

Chemical interactions with clouds – cloud processing
More than 60% of the total sulphate on a global scale is
estimated to be produced in clouds (Langner and Rodhe,
1991; Liao et al., 2003). It has been shown in several stud-
ies that the production of sulphate in cloud drops can con-
tribute signiﬁcantly to the aerosol mass (e.g., Chameides and
Stelson, 1992; Hegg et al., 1996; Zhang et al., 1999) and
may lead either to an enhancement or to a suppression of
the cloud drop number concentration (Feingold and Krei-
denweis, 2000). The dissolution into cloud drops leads to a
separation of soluble and insoluble species, respectively, and
possibly to different reaction pathways. Dissolved species
will be released to the gas phase after evaporation of the
cloud. However, they may undergo chemical conversions in
the aqueous phase changing their physical properties (e.g.,
vapour pressure) and/or chemical properties (e.g., ability to
form low volatility adducts). The importance of chemical
conversions in the tropospheric aqueous phase (i.e., clouds
and fogs) leading to inorganic secondary aerosol mass pro-
duction (in particular sulphate) is recognized. On the con-
trary, the signiﬁcance of such mechanism for SOA produc-
tion is not yet well established and therefore is not included
in large scale models.
The water soluble fraction of organic carbon can consist on
average of 35% of mono- and dicarboxylic acids (Decesari
et al., 2000). In urban environments dicarboxylic acids con-
tribute 1% of the aerosol mass; in less polluted regions the
contributions can be higher, with average values of ∼7–20%
and even up to 30–50% (Satsumbayashi et al., 1989, 1990).
Major components in this group are small dicarboxylic acids
(C2-C6) with oxalic acid being the major compound with
fractions of about 50%–75% of the total dicarboxylic acid
mass found in rainwater (Semp´er´e and Kawamura, 1996) as
well as aerosol samples in the marine boundary layer (Kawa-
mura and Sakaguchi, 1999). Observations by Baboukas et
al. (2000) in the marine boundary layer have revealed that
at relative humidities around 80% about 30% of oxalic and
46% of pyruvic acid are present in the gas phase.
In general, enhanced oxidant concentrations have been de-
tected in the interstitial parts of clouds which facilitate the ef-
ﬁcient oxidation of organic trace gases there which leads to
small aldehydes, alcohols, monocarboxylic acids, and ace-
tone (Blando and Turpin, 2000). Yao et al. (2002) found
a clear correlation between the sulphate mass size distribu-
tion and those for oxalate, malonate and succinate. Both sul-
phate and dicarboxylic acids accumulate in the drop mode,
i.e. particles which acted as cloud condensation nuclei and,
thus, were processed by clouds. Similar observations were
made by Mochida et al. (2003a) showing bimodal mass dis-
tributions for both C2-C4 dicarboxylic acids and sulphate,
respectively.
The modiﬁcation of the larger size aerosol
mode was ascribed to mass addition in clouds. Based on
correlations of concentrations in both the gas and particle
phase, Mochida et al. (2003b) conclude that the precursors
for these dicarboxylic acids might have anthropogenic ori-
gin. Another indicator for cloud processing is the presence
of hydroxymethanesulfonate (HMS−) in mixed dicarboxylic
acid/sulphate particles (Lee et al., 2002, 2003). Since HMS−
is exclusively formed within the aqueous phase it is likely
that other constituents of these particles also originate from
cloud processing. All these observations suggest that chem-
ical processing within atmospheric aqueous aerosols might
contribute to secondary organic aerosol formation.
Kawamura and Sakaguchi (1999) using principal compo-
nent analysis of individual diacid, coupled with information
on photochemical reactions, suggest that C2 and C3 diacids
present in aerosols are likely produced by the oxidation of
C4 and longer-chain diacids, whereas longer-chain (C5-C10)
diacids are produced through the oxidation of semivolatile
fatty acids which are also oxidation products of unsaturated
fatty acids. Oxygenated organics have Henry’s law Constants
of KH ≈100 M atm−1 (alcohols) up to KH≈109 M atm−1
(di-, and ketocarboxylic acids) (Sander, 1999). Thus, the

aqueous phase might represent a signiﬁcant sink for the few
highly water soluble organic species that exist in the atmo-
sphere. Aumont et al. (2000) have calculated that difunc-
tional organic compounds, which are formed either in the gas
or aqueous phase, are preferable in the gas phase. Only or-
ganics with three or more functional groups (e.g., hydroxy
and/or carbonyl compounds) have a vapour pressure sufﬁ-
ciently low to enable signiﬁcant partitioning into the aqueous
phase. However, the chemical pathways in their model can-
not predict the high amounts of dicarboxylic acids found in
aerosol samples.
Graedel and Weschler (1981) give a detailed overview of
chemical conversions of organics in aqueous atmospheric
aerosols. They show that aldehydes in the gas phase might
act as precursors for organic acid formation in the aqueous
phase which is reﬂected in similar concentration patterns for
both species groups. These oxidation processes are faster and
more efﬁcient in the aqueous phase due to hydration effects,
while in the gas phase photooxidation of aldehydes usually
leads to the loss of the carbonyl function. Chebbi and Car-
lier (1996) suggest that high concentrations of glyoxal and
methylglyoxal in clouds might act as precursors for oxalic
and pyruvic acid formation, respectively. Warneck (2003)
suggested that in marine environments ethylene and acety-
lene may act as gas phase precursors of oxalic acid in the
aqueous phase via the formation of glyoxal that is dissolved
and reacts in the aqueous phase. Glyoxal can be also pro-
duced from the oxidation of aromatics. Thus the proposed
mechanism of oxalic acid formation is also valid under pol-
luted conditions. It seems likely that oxalic and pyruvic acids
may be formed in clouds and are released upon evaporation.
Up to now there is no comprehensive mechanism available
predicting their formation in the gas phase.
Recently detailed chemical multiphase mechanisms have
been suggested in order to elucidate oxalate formation in
clouds. Herrmann et al. (2000) and Ervens et al. (2003) de-
veloped the Chemical Aqueous Phase Radical Mechanism
(CAPRAM) for modelling tropospheric multiphase chem-
istry that contains a detailed treatment of the oxidation of or-
ganic compounds with one and two carbon atoms. Possible
pathways for the formation of small dicarboxylic acids are
included in the chemical mechanism by Ervens et al. (2004)
where toluene, ethylene, isoprene and cyclohexene are as-
sumed as gas phase precursors.
The kinetics of aqueous
phase reactions relevant for atmospheric chemistry have been
recently reviewed by Herrmann (2003) including spectro-
scopic data of a signiﬁcant number of peroxy-radicals in
aqueous solution and kinetic data for OH and NO3 radical
reactions in aqueous solution, for various organic molecules
like carbonylic and carboxylic compounds, phenols and
amines. However, the current state of chemical mechanism
development for aqueous phase chemistry is quite limited
due to the lack of appropriate rate constants and, to a greater
extent, results of product studies (Herrmann, 2003).
Beside the formation of low volatility organics in clouds,
and, thus, modiﬁcation of the mass and hygroscopic proper-
ties of aerosols, the absorption properties of aerosols might
also be changed by cloud processing. Keto- and dicarboxy-
lates likely form complexes with transition metals, in partic-
ular, with iron and copper (Zuo and Hoign´e, 1992, 1994).
In contrast to the ‘free’ dicarboxylates, these complexes ab-
sorb light in the visible range leading to photo-oxidation of
the organics. In addition, it has been shown by Gelencs´er
et al. (2003) that hydroxyl substituted aromatic compounds
can be oxidized to humic-like substances in aqueous solution
which are light-absorbing in the visible range as well. How-
ever, these effects are not yet included in complex cloud ra-
diation models so that the overall effect of this phenomenon
cannot be quantiﬁed.
In summary,
– At the current state of model development the role that
cloud chemistry plays with respect to organic mass pro-
duction, compared to other processes, cannot yet be de-
termined.
– The chemical mass production processes seem to be re-
stricted to dicarboxylic acids.
Other fractions of the
water soluble organic carbon consisting of neutral and
polyacidic compounds (Decesari et al., 2000) probably
have other sources.
– Processing of organic species in cloud droplets might
inﬂuence both the direct and indirect effect of aerosols
by modifying the mass (i.e. size) and the composition
and thus the physical characteristics (like hygroscopic
and radiative properties) of the aerosol.
This latter
might be the most important effect of cloud organic
chemistry.
– Despite the potential importance of the tropospheric
aqueous phase with respect to organics, this process is
not included in global models.

Organic aerosol and water interactions
The water uptake by the organic aerosol components and
their interactions with the inorganic salts dissolved in the
same aqueous solution changes the aerosol water concentra-
tion and the resulting aerosol properties. At the same time,
the extent of the partitioning for any individual organic com-
pound between the gas and particulate phases depends not
only on the amounts and properties of the compound, but
also on the amount of water present in the atmosphere. Un-
derstanding the effects of aerosol water on SOA formation
and vice versa is, therefore, central to understanding the SOA
formation and role in the atmosphere.
The aerosol hygroscopicity is commonly expressed by the
growth factor (GF) that is the ratio between the humidiﬁed

and dry particle diameter at a reference relative humidity
(RH). Most (but not all) recent studies have been obtained at
or converted to a reference humidity of 90%. For pure sub-
stances, the hygroscopic diameter or mass growth of aerosol
particles can be calculated if the concentration of the so-
lute material as function of the water vapour pressure ratio
(partial pressure of water vapour divided by saturation wa-
ter vapour pressure) over the particle surface is known. For
ﬂat solution surfaces or for large particles, this water vapour
pressure ratio is equal to the RH, which can be measured at
some distance from the particle. For particles smaller than a
few hundred nanometres in diameter, the water vapour pres-
sure ratio that the particles senses – the water activity of the
solution – is smaller than the RH away from the particle. The
correction factor is given by the Kelvin term, as described by
the K¨ohler equation (Appendix A – Eq. A1).
Data on the relation between solute concentration and wa-
ter activity (or RH) is therefore crucial for these calculations.
If all solutions behaved ideally, this would simply be given
by Raoult’s law, and would be quite straightforward to esti-
mate from basic chemical solute data. Raoult’s law simply
states that the water activity (or equilibrium RH) over the so-
lution is given by the ratio of the moles of water molecules to
the moles of all molecules in the solution (water molecules
plus all dissolved ions and/or molecules other than water).
Various formulations of Raoult’s law are used in most cal-
culations of aerosol particle activation into cloud droplets,
since the solutions are normally sufﬁciently diluted at the
point of activation. However, since most solutions deviate
from ideal behaviour empirical data on water activity versus
solute concentration are needed. Additional important ther-
modynamic data needed to describe hygroscopic growth are
densities (dry solute and solution), surface tension, and for
some substances also solute vapour pressures for aqueous so-
lutions.
Here, we will review the existing data describing the water
activity as a function of solute concentration for pure organic
compounds, their mixtures and mixtures of organic and inor-
ganic compounds.
The solute concentration is normally given as mole frac-
tion of solute (moles of solute per moles of solute plus water)
or molality (moles of solute per kg of water). Water activity
data for a wide range of inorganic substances can be found in
the literature (for instance: Robinson and Stokes, 1959; Tang
et al., 1997 and references therein), and will not be discussed
here.
Corresponding data for water soluble organic compounds
relevant to atmospheric applications are rather scarce in com-
parison, partly because organic compounds were previously
not considered important for the hygroscopic and cloud-
forming properties of atmospheric aerosols, and also because
organic compounds are more difﬁcult to measure than inor-
ganic compounds, especially the low-molecular weight or-
ganics due to their high volatility.
7.1
Water activity data for organic compounds: laboratory
work on individual compounds
Instrumentation: Measurements of water activity as function
of organic solute concentration can be performed either on
bulk solutions or on suspended particles. While bulk mea-
surements, using commercially available and highly accurate
water activity meters, can only provide data for saturated so-
lutions or more dilute, the methods based on observations
of suspended solution particles are able to quantify the wa-
ter uptake also for highly supersaturated solutions that would
rapidly crystallize in the bulk. Since it is likely that supersat-
urated solutions are found in atmospheric aerosols, data for
supersaturated solutions are highly relevant, but these stud-
ies involve the use of non-commercial instrumentation such
as an electrodynamic balance (EDB; Peng et al., 2001) or
a Hygroscopic Tandem Differential Mobility Analyzer (HT-
DMA; Mikhailov et al., 2004). The RH to which the sus-
pended particles are subjected can be varied over a wide
range in both these instruments (∼0% to ∼99%), and can
thus be used to study the full RH hysteresis behaviour of a
multitude of relevant compounds and mixtures. The EDB
relies on the balancing of gravitational forces and normally
requires the suspended particles to be larger than a few µm
in diameter, while the HTDMA technique separates particles
according to their electrical mobility and is optimal for sub-
micrometer particles. Special-design HTDMA instruments
have been used to particle sizes down to 10 nm or less. Since
the Kelvin curvature correction term is substantial for these
ultra ﬁne particles, the HTDMA can give some additional in-
sight regarding particle surface tension. The scanning EDB is
a recent improvement of the traditional EDB, allowing much
faster water activity measurements to be performed over a
wide range of RH, and facilitates studies of semi-volatile or-
ganic compounds (Choi and Chan, 2002b).
For both the EDB and HTDMA, a reference state of known
composition must be chosen. There are two possibilities (1)
a dehydrated particle at low RH, and (2) a droplet at high RH
for which water activity data is available or can be measured
in bulk solution. The choice of reference state can be prob-
lematic for compounds for which bulk water activity data are
not available and for which the particles are suspected to re-
tain water even at very low RH.
The HTDMA instrument is a ﬂow-through system, pro-
ducing data on the distribution of hygroscopic diameter
growth for a large number of aerosol particles for each par-
ticle dry diameter and RH. This instrument is therefore well
suited for ﬁeld studies of the hygroscopic properties of at-
mospheric aerosol particles, and numerous such studies us-
ing HTDMA instruments have been carried out in a variety
of environments. The EDB relies on the capture of a single
particle in an electric ﬁeld, and is only suited for laboratory
studies. The HTDMA and EDB instruments are therefore in
many ways complementary for studies of particle water up-
take.

M. Kanakidou et al.: Organic aerosol and global climate modelling
Available data: Bulk data for the water activity and other
thermodynamic properties are available for a large number
of organic compounds. References are given in Saxena and
Hildemann (1997), who point to, in particular, the extensive
data compilation of the Dortmund Data Bank DECHEMA
(Gmehling et al., 1994). These data will not be discussed fur-
ther here, but nevertheless constitute a valuable resource for
water activity data for organic compounds at solute concen-
trations below saturation. The water activity data obtained
with EDB and HTDMA instruments are summarized in Ta-
ble 7.
Table 7 is structured per organic compound studied and
includes humic-like substances (HULIS): humic and fulvic
acids, organic acids, mostly dicarboxylic acids, and some
organic compounds that do not dissociate in solution such
as sugars, organic salts, and ﬁnally pharmaceutical com-
pounds. This data compilation was limited to include only
well-deﬁned WSOC or mixtures thereof, also in mixtures
with inorganic compounds of atmospheric relevance. It does
not include studies of CCN properties of organic compounds.
The studies in Table 8 present, either water activity as a func-
tion of solute concentration, or hygroscopic particle growth
in some form.
Since this ﬁeld of research is rather new, most of the work
cited was published within the last few years only. The inter-
est in the hygroscopic properties of WSOC started somewhat
earlier in the pharmaceutical sciences owing to their impor-
tance for lung deposition and drug administration, and was
reviewed already in 1993 by Hickey and Martonen (1993).
Most of the earlier EDB and HTDMA studies focussed on
inorganic compounds such as sulphates and nitrates, and
are not discussed here. Several of the studies present only
qualitative results (Brooks et al., 2002; Brooks et al., 2003;
Lightstone et al., 2000; Braban et al., 2003; Marcolli et
al., 2004). Hansson et al. (1998) used a TDMA to exam-
ine the effect of tetracosane, octanoic acid, and lauric acid
on the hygroscopic properties of NaCl aerosol particles at
RH between 30 and 95%.
A slight lowering of the deli-
quescence relative humidity, DRH and suppression of hy-
groscopic growth for the NaCl-organic compound mixtures
were observed when compared to pure NaCl particles. De-
spite the mixing of the organic material with NaCl, hystere-
sis was observed for decreasing RH histories, suggesting the
formation of metastable droplets. Few parameterisations are
given showing that this ﬁeld is still in its infancy. However,
parameterisations are needed for implementation in models
of water uptake by organic compounds, or can be used to test
the quality of the published results in repeat experiments.
– We strongly recommend efforts to derive parameterisa-
tions of water activity versus solute concentration (mo-
lality or mole fraction of solute) from the available data
and in all future studies. HTDMA parameterisations
given as hygroscopic diameter growth factor as func-
tion of relative humidity should preferably be recalcu-
lated and presented as water activity versus solute con-
centration. Error estimates should be clearly stated in
parameterized form that can easily be incorporated into
models.
In several of the studies, the applicability of the Zdanovskii-
Stokes-Robinson (ZSR) mixing rule was tested to examine
the water uptake of well-deﬁned mixtures, and to deduce in-
teraction terms to be used in models (Chan and Chan, 2003).
The ZSR method assumes that no interaction occurs between
the various compounds of the solution, and is equivalent to
adding the amount of water taken up by the individual com-
pounds (relative to their mass or molar fractions) in order
to calculate the water uptake of the mixture. In most cases,
the ZSR mixing rule works fairly in describing the water up-
take of both organic-organic and organic-inorganic mixtures
and can be used as a ﬁrst approximation. There are how-
ever large deviations in some cases, which are difﬁcult to ac-
count for. Deviations from the simple water additivity of the
ZSR mixing rule have been studied and are often discussed
in terms of the ability of the organic compounds for “salting
in” or “salting out”, or in other words whether the presence
of the organics increases or decreases the water uptake of
the solution due to interactions between the organic and the
inorganic compounds. Organics were observed to decrease
the water uptake by NaCl but increase that of ammonium
sulphate (Prenni et al., 2003; Choi and Chan, 2002a; Cruz
and Pandis, 2000). The dissociation behaviour of the organic
compounds needs to be taken into account when studying
their water activity and CCN properties.
It can be proven theoretically that the mutual DRH of an
aerosol particle consisting of a mixture of compounds is al-
ways lower than the DRH of the individual compounds. This
was noted by Wexler and Seinfeld (1991) to be valid for inor-
ganic compounds. Marcolli et al. (2004) extended this theory
to organic compounds and argued that a mixture of several
organics, as is likely to appear in atmospheric aerosol parti-
cles, may remain in the liquid phase and retain water even at
very low RH. In other words, the DRH of the organic mix-
tures or organic-inorganic mixtures is depressed. This is in
general agreement with ﬁeld observations. This behaviour
is potentially of great importance for atmospheric applica-
tions, since it means that a liquid aqueous phase would nearly
always be present, affecting the radiative properties of the
aerosol and possibly also affect the overall aqueous phase re-
action rates. This can also explain the observation that
– Organic compounds contribute to water uptake most
signiﬁcantly at low RH, while at high RH, the inorgan-
ics dominate see for instance Dick et al. (2000).
– For mixtures of poorly soluble organics and inorgan-
ics, the lowering of DRH is small or negligible (Cruz
and Pandis, 2000), while for more soluble organic com-
pounds, the effect is clearly noticeable (Brooks et al.,
2002).

Modelling of SOA – water interactions
Most regional (Binkowski and Roselle, 2003) and global (Li-
ousse et al., 1996; Grifﬁn et al., 1999b; Kanakidou et al.,
2000; Chung and Seinfeld, 2002; Tsigaridis and Kanaki-
dou, 2003) models neglect the ability of SOA to inﬂuence
directly (by absorbing water) or indirectly (by changing the
activity coefﬁcients of the inorganic components) the aerosol
water uptake. There are three major barriers that prevent a
detailed description of the interactions among organic, inor-
ganic aerosol compounds and water.
– First, there is a lack of fundamental chemical and
thermodynamic information about organic compounds
(Clegg et al., 2001), the identity of which is often un-
known. Important thermodynamics data would include
Henry’s law constants, equilibrium vapour pressures,
dissociation constants of the acidic organic compounds,
as well as solubilities in water (Anttila et al., 2002).
– Second, a suitable theoretical framework is needed that
would allow the prediction of the properties of com-
plex mixed (organic and inorganic) particles, based on a
sparse set of data.
– Third, the theoretical framework developed must be
computationally efﬁcient, so it can be included within
a typical global model simulation.
Considerable effort has been expended towards achieving
these goals. Saxena and Hildemann (1997) proposed that
the UNIquac Functional-group Activity Coefﬁcient UNIFAC
method (Fredeslund et al., 1994) could be a useful ﬁrst ap-
proximation for estimating water activities of aqueous or-
ganic solutions. They argued that UNIFAC can reproduce
in most cases, water activities to within approximately 15%
for a wide variety of compounds (e.g., glycols, dicarboxylic
acids, keto acids) and a wide range of solute concentrations.
The following paragraphs summarise the ﬁrst efforts to de-
scribe the SOA-water interactions and to estimate how much
aerosol water is associated with SOA.
Ansari and Pandis (2000) used the UNIFAC method to
predict the water uptake of SOA. Their model assumed that
the aerosol consisted of a primarily inorganic and a pre-
dominantly organic phase, which did not interact with each
other.
The inorganic contained inorganic salts and water
while the organic phase contained the organic species and
small amounts of water and semivolatile inorganics (e.g.,
ammonium nitrate).
The model predictions were qualita-
tively consistent with the few available measurements sug-
gesting that the hygroscopic growth of SOA is signiﬁcantly
less than their inorganic counterparts. Using lumped SOA
species, they reported that SOA accounts for approximately
10% of total aerosol water and increases aerosol nitrate con-
centrations by approximately 10%. At high relative humidity
(greater than 85%), the effect of SOA on nitrate partitioning
and water uptake was negligible. At low relative humidity
(less than 50%), SOA could account for 20% of aerosol wa-
ter.
Seinfeld et al. (2001) considered the interaction of indi-
vidual SOA compounds with water vapour; the free energy
was calculated using UNIFAC. Their model did explain how
increasing RH in biogenic hydrocarbon/ozone systems uni-
formly increases both the amount of condensed organic mass
and the amount of liquid water in the aerosol phase. The
presence of inorganic compounds was not considered. The

M. Kanakidou et al.: Organic aerosol and global climate modelling
model gave relatively good agreement with the measure-
ments of Cocker et al. (2001a) for 50% RH but tended to
underpredict the water uptake at 85% RH (e.g. predicted vol-
umetric growth of 20% versus observed 30%). The study
also indicated that it may be a useful ﬁrst approximation to
assume a unity activity coefﬁcient for many compounds mak-
ing up SOA mixtures.
In a sensitivity study, Bowman and Karamalegos (2002)
estimated that the dissolution of SOA compounds in water
could increase the SOA concentration by as much as 50%.
The SOA species were also increasing the aerosol water con-
centration by roughly 1 µg µg−1 of SOA at 80% RH. The
effects were more pronounced during the nighttime high rel-
ative humidity periods.
Ming and Russell (2002) proposed a combined Pitzer-
UNIFAC approach for the description of the phase equilib-
ria of mixtures of electrolytes and organic species in aqueous
solutions. The activity coefﬁcient of each species in solution
was explicitly related to the chemical composition by treating
the (inorganic) ion-water, organic-water and ion-organic in-
teractions. The model predicted that the mixing of highly sol-
uble organic compounds (solubility higher than 4 mol L−1)
can decrease the deliquescence RH of the salt, a phenomenon
typically seen in the deliquescence of multicomponent inor-
ganic aerosols. This model was used to simulate the hygro-
scopic behaviour of sea-salt aerosol using twenty insoluble
and four soluble organic species (Ming and Russell, 2001).
The hygroscopic diameter growth factor of a particle con-
sisting of purely inorganic sea salt was predicted to be 15%
higher than that of a particle consisting of 70% inorganic sea
salt and 30% organics for moderate and high RH. The effect
increases for higher organic mass fractions.
Water activity predictions from calculations using the
UNIFAC model were found to agree with the measured water
activity data for oxalic, malonic, succinic, glutaric, and cit-
ric acid to within 40% but deviations were as large as 100%
for malic acid and tartaric acid (Peng et al., 2001). After
modiﬁcation of the functional group interaction parameters
of the COOH-H2O-OH-H2O, and OH-COOH pairs by ﬁtting
the UNIFAC model with the measured data the agreement of
predictions and measurements improved to within 35% for
all the acids studied.
Clegg et al. (2001) proposed a thermodynamic framework
for the description of the aqueous aerosol phase containing
both inorganics and organics applicable at medium to high
RH when water is the major component of the solution (sol-
vent). In this approach the ion-water, organic-water, and ion-
organic contributions to activity coefﬁcients are calculated
independently. Even with this simpliﬁcation data for aque-
ous solutions of the organic molecules are required.
Koo et al. (2003a) described the interactions between
the SOA species and water by using representative organic
species and the UNIFAC method to describe the water ab-
sorption by the lumped SOA compounds. Comparison be-
tween the predictions of this model and the few available
smog chamber studies suggested a serious underprediction
(by a factor of 2 to 3) of the water concentration predicted
by the models. The authors corrected for this bias by using
a constant correction factor for each precursor. Application
of the tool to Southern California suggested that SOA in-
creases the aerosol water concentration by 2–13% depending
on the conditions. The effect of this additional SOA water on
aerosol nitrate was found to be insigniﬁcant for all cases.
Pun et al. (2002) classiﬁed SOA compounds as either “hy-
drophobic” or “hydrophilic”. The hydrophobic species are
assumed dissolved in a predominantly organic phase together
with the primary organic aerosol components. Hydrophilic
compounds are assumed to dissolve in the aqueous aerosol
phase together with inorganic salts; the organic compounds
however were not allowed to affect the activity coefﬁcients
of the inorganic salts. The activity coefﬁcients of the or-
ganic solutes were calculated using UNIFAC and the aerosol
water content was estimated using the Zdanovskii-Stokes-
Robinson (ZSR) approach (with the basic assumption that
the quantities of water associated with each solute are ad-
ditive). Three anthropogenic and two biogenic hydrophilic
SOA species were used as surrogates in the model to repre-
sent the individual SOA compounds. The properties of these
surrogate compounds were reasonable estimates based on as-
sumed structures of these molecules.
Most SOA-water modelling studies have relied on arbi-
trarily chosen model compounds for the representation of
the hygroscopic properties of the SOA mixture.
Fuzzi et
al. (2001) proposed a complimentary conceptual approach
based on functional group analysis. The method relies on the
construction of model compounds based on experimental in-
formation (chromatographic analysis and carbon analysis of
each fraction and HNMR analysis).
7.3
Hygroscopicity of SOA and multicomponent carbona-
ceous aerosol: laboratory studies
The hygroscopic behaviour of freshly formed carbonaceous
particles (primary as well as secondary) has been studied in
the laboratory for a number of biogenic and anthropogenic
model compounds. Table 8 gives some examples of recent
studies and results. It shows that freshly formed carbona-
ceous particles (soot as well as secondary organics) have very
low to low growth factors GF: diesel soot can be consid-
ered as hydrophobic whereas oxidation products of toluene,
a model compound for anthropogenic SOA, are moderately
hygroscopic. Also water soluble organic compounds, as hu-
mic and fulvic acid, as well as ‘isolated organic matter’, have
very low hygroscopicity, LH (Gysel et al., 2004). On the
other hand, the few available laboratory studies on the hy-
groscopicity of biomass burning aerosol show that, unlike
the previous classes of carbonaceous particles, they have a
hygroscopic behaviour comparable to inorganic salts.
Virkkula et al. (1999) measured the hygroscopic proper-
ties of aerosol formed by oxidation of three monoterpenes,

limonene, alpha-pinene, and beta-pinene, using a tandem
differential mobility analyzer (TDMA). The experiments
included ozonolysis and photooxidation with and without
ammonium sulphate seed aerosol.
Pure organic particles,
formed by oxidation of the terpenes in the absence of the
seed aerosol, proved to be slightly hygroscopic. The diam-
eter growth factor was close to 1.1 at RH 85%. In the ex-
periments with ammonium sulphate seed aerosol the growth
factor decreased from approximately 1.5 before the start of
terpene oxidation to approximately 1.1 as the oxidation prod-
ucts condensed on the particles. Their analysis showed that
in the internally mixed particles, ammonium sulphate and the
organic products take up water independently of one another.
The majority of laboratory investigations of SOA for-
mation have been carried out in the absence of water. A
roughly 10% increase in the overall aerosol yield of the a-
pinene/ozone system was observed by Cocker et al. (2001a)
when the RH of the experiments was increased from less
than 2% to around 50%. The observed change in the overall
aerosol yield during pinene ozonolysis in the presence of wa-
ter vapour includes the effects of water vapour on gas-phase
chemistry, the water uptake of the particles, and the change
in the partitioning of the SOA compounds. Further analy-
sis indicated that most of this increase was due to the water
uptake by the SOA. The presence of aqueous salt particles
in the system was found to reduce the overall (organic ma-
terial plus associated water) aerosol yield relative to the no
seed experiments by 15–35%. The effect differed according
to the salt, with ammonium sulphate causing the greatest re-
duction in yield. The authors argued that the presence of the
electrolytes reduces the fraction of the organic aerosol parti-
tioning from the gas to the aerosol phase.

Edney et al. (2000) irradiated toluene/propylene/NOx/air
mixtures in the presence of submicron ammonium sulphate
aerosol. The generated aerosols contained organic and inor-
ganic constituents with liquid water concentrations ranging
from 4 to 65 µg m−3. They concluded that the presence of
aerosol liquid water did not signiﬁcantly change the amount
of the SOA that formed from the oxidation of toluene. The
amount of SOA generated during the photooxidation of m-
xylene and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene in the presence of ammo-
nium sulphate aerosol was also unaffected by the presence of
water at RH up to 50% (Cocker et al., 2001b). The water up-
take by SOA produced during the photooxidation of toluene,
p-xylene, and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene in the presence of NOx
and ammonium sulphate aerosol was negligible compared to
the water due to the inorganics (Kleindienst et al., 1999).

M. Kanakidou et al.: Organic aerosol and global climate modelling
aerosol formed during the photooxidation of m-xylene and
1,3,5-trimethylbenzene at 85% RH increased with the extent
of the reaction, indicating that the ﬁrst-generation oxidation
products undergo further oxidation.
Kleindienst et al. (2002) investigated the SOA formation
from the irradiation of simulated automobile exhaust. The
hygroscopic potential of the aerosol was determined with the
use of a liquid water content analyzer, and the analysis indi-
cated that the aerosol uptake of water was minor at relative
humidities less than 70%. Organic analysis of the collected
aerosol from this complex system indicated that the identi-
ﬁed oxidation products were identical to those found in the
toluene oxidation system.
Jang and Kamens (1998) investigated the humidity ef-
fects on the gas/particle partitioning of twenty different
semivolatile organic compounds (primary and secondary) in
the organic layer of wood soot, diesel soot, and SOA. A
model based on the UNIFAC approach was used to estimate
the activity coefﬁcients. It was concluded that the humid-
ity effect on partitioning of semivolatile compounds is most
signiﬁcant for hydrophobic compounds in polar aerosols.
7.4
Hygroscopicity of ambient aerosols
Numerous ﬁeld studies have been conducted in the past
decades to document the hygroscopicity of atmospheric par-
ticles under a variety of conditions. In many cases particles
with clearly distinct hygroscopic properties have been ob-
served in a single air sample. These hygroscopicity classes
are usually classiﬁed as “near hydrophobic”, “less hygro-
scopic” (LH) and “more hygroscopic” (MH). However, de-
pending on the environment, the actual GF corresponding to
each of these classes (in particular the LH and MH) can show
large variation. Table 10 gives an overview of recent stud-
ies from which we have extracted frequency of occurrence
and number fraction of particles with GF<1.2 and those with
GF>1.2. Without claiming to be exhaustive, we have tried
to compile studies that give typical results for a range of at-
mospheric conditions, from the street canyon to the remote
marine environment. More data compilations can be found
in Cocker et al. (2001) and Baltensperger et al. (2002). The
separation of the two classes at GF 1.2 is rather arbitrary,
but has been made in the ﬁrst place to evaluate the trend in
the LH aerosol fraction to the total population when moving
away from the source areas (urban background) to remote
sites. The column “fraction of occurrence” is the product of
the “fraction of time” LH particles occur and “number frac-
tion” when LH particles occur, which allows to rank the im-
portance of these particles.
As can be seen in the studies mentioned in Table 10, the
GF of these particles tends to increase with particle size.
Hence, the data indicates that mixing of the initially less hy-
groscopic particles with soluble secondary aerosol, increases
the hygroscopicity of the particles.
Biomass burning plumes measured in the Amazonian
basin are strongly dominated at all sizes by LH particles,
even when they are relatively aged. Also here, inspection of
the GF values shows an increase of the GF with particle size
(Vestin, 2003). African biomass burning plumes aged over
the Atlantic show all particles in the more hygroscopic class,
indicating the presence of (secondary) soluble components,
possibly originating from marine dimethylsulﬁde (DMS) ox-
idation products, or anthropogenic pollutants co-transported
with the plume.
Also in conditions where secondary “organic” aerosol is
being formed (Boreal, Amazon and Mediterranean forests)
the LH fraction remains high, although also here decreasing
with particle size. This indicates an internal mixing between
soluble salts and the in-situ formed organic components.
The picture emerging from the ‘real-world’ data is the fol-
lowing:
– Under trafﬁc-dominated conditions (street canyon and
urban background), a signiﬁcant fraction of LH parti-
cles is quasi permanently observed. This fraction de-
creases with increasing particle size for a given urban
site.
– The time fraction of occurrence of these less hygro-
scopic particles decreases progressively when moving
from the urban background to continental and to remote
marine locations. Simultaneously, a population of more
hygroscopic particles is always present.
Analysis of the results of the following studies has led to a
series of valuable insights regarding the role of organics in
the hygroscopic growth of particles. The study of the hygro-
scopic behaviour of atmospheric particles collected above the
North Atlantic Ocean by Posfai et al. (1998) suggested that
organic ﬁlms on the particles may be responsible for the ob-
served relatively large water uptake at low relative humidi-
ties.
Swietlicki et al. (1999) combined measurements of hygro-
scopic diameter growth factors and aerosol composition in
Northern England to investigate the role of organics in the
aerosol water uptake. For particles in the 0.17–0.53 µm size
range they were able to reproduce the observed growth that
agreed with the theoretical estimate within experimental er-
ror for all cases but one. They proposed that the discrepancy
for this air mass for which the aerosol had undergone exten-
sive photochemical processing was due to organics.
Lowenthal et al. (2003) examined the ability of organic
aerosols to absorb water as a function of relative humidity
(RH) using data collected during the 1999 Big Bend Re-
gional Aerosol and Visibility Observational Study (BRAVO).
On average, organics accounted for 22% of PM2.5 mass.
Hourly RH exceeded 80% only 3.5% of the time and av-
eraged 44%.
BRAVO aerosol chemical composition and

growth associated with inorganic species was sufﬁcient to
account for measured light scattering for RH between 70
and 95%. Analysis of visibility measurements in the Great
Smoky Mountain (Eastern US) and Grand Canyon (Western
US) suggested that organics were weakly to non hygroscopic
(Malm and Day, 2001).
Dick et al. (2000) found that the water content of sub-0.4
micrometer particles measured by TDMA in Great Smoky
Mountains was higher than the sulphate-associated water
modelled using laboratory data for binary aqueous solutions
and the method of Zdanovskii-Stokes-Robinson (ZSR) for
multi-component solutions over a wide range of humidi-
ties (RH=5–85%). Furthermore, excess water was observed
to increase in proportion to the organic fraction of mass.
Organic-associated water content was considerably less than
that of sulphate compounds, on a volume basis, for high RH,
but comparable or greater for low RH.
Speer et al. (2003) used a beta gauge to measure the
change in PM2.5 mass on a ﬁlter as a function of relative hu-
midity in a humidity-controlled environmental chamber. For
six of the eight samples collected in North Carolina, the mea-
sured liquid water concentrations exceeded those predicted
from the presence of the inorganic constituents. A relation-
ship between the excess liquid water and the measured or-
ganic carbon mass was found, although the standard devia-
tions associated with the measurements were large. Through
modelling studies it was determined that, on average, about
20% of the aerosol water could be associated with organic
compounds. These results were relatively consistent with
the measurements and analysis of Khlystov et al. (2005) in
the Northeastern US. The authors concluded that as much as
30% of the aerosol water during the summer could be due to
the organics.
The study of the hygroscopic behaviour of atmospheric
particles collected above the North Atlantic Ocean by Pos-
fai et al. (1998) suggested that organic ﬁlms on the particles
may be responsible for the observed relatively large uptake
at low relative humidities. On the other hand, it has been
hypothesized that the presence of organic ﬁlms on the sur-
face of aerosols can strongly inhibit condensational growth.
Chuang (2003a) measured the timescale for condensational
growth of ambient particles with diameters of 50 and 100 nm
in Mexico City.
He showed that almost all the particles
(more than 98%) during both wet and dry conditions exhibit
timescales of less than 3 s.

Organic aerosol-cloud interactions
It was originally assumed that cloud condensation nuclei
(CCN) concentration at a given supersaturation is mainly a
function of aerosol number concentration and the ability of
an aerosol particle to become cloud droplet is mainly con-
trolled by the aerosol particle radius (e.g., Feingold, 2003).

1093
Recently, studies which use new data on aerosol chemical
composition (e.g., Shulman et al., 1996; Facchini et al.,
1999b; Mircea et al., 2002; Nenes et al., 2002b) show that
chemical composition of the aerosol can also inﬂuence the
CCN number concentrations.
– Understanding of the processes by which the parti-
cles containing organic compounds are transformed into
drops is a necessary requirement for improving the cer-
tainty of climate change predictions (Charlson et al.,
2001).
– This need for understanding organic aerosol will be-
come even more important in the future, where carbona-
ceous aerosol emissions from developing economies are
expected to dramatically increase (IPCC, 2001).
Cloud droplet activation is a key process for the indirect ef-
fect, since it is the direct microphysical aerosol-cloud link.
Although the basic theory of aerosol activation is well estab-
lished, inclusion of numerical activation models (e.g., Jensen
and Charlson, 1984; Flossmann et al., 1985; Pruppacher and
Klett, 1980; Seinfeld and Pandis, 1998; Nenes et al., 2001)
is in itself computationally challenging, so activation needs
to be parameterized. Numerous such parameterisations have
appeared over the years (e.g., Twomey, 1959; Squires and
Twomey, 1960; Feingold and Heymsﬁeld, 1992; Cohard et
al., 1998, 2000; Ghan et al., 1993, 1995; Abdul-Razzak et
al., 1998; Abdul-Razzak and Ghan, 2000; Chuang and Pen-
ner, 1995; Rissman et al., 2004; Nenes and Seinfeld, 2003).
Very few of these relationships can explicitly account for the
effect of organic aerosol. This is because
– the properties of potentially CCN active organics in
aerosols are not sufﬁciently known and thus
– the resulting modiﬁed K¨ohler equation for CCN con-
taining organics cannot be solved explicitly for their
critical supersaturation, Sc, a requirement for most ex-
tant parameterisations.
8.1
Organic species and their effect on cloud droplet for-
mation.
Organic species, accounting from 10 to 70% of the total am-
bient aerosol mass (Saxena and Hildemann, 1996; Zappoli
et al., 1999; Turpin et al., 2000) are an important class of
compounds and are at present poorly characterized (Jacob-
son et al., 2000).
Novakov and Penner (1993), Novakov
and Corrigan (1996), Facchini et al. (1999b) (and others)
have proved that the more water soluble organic compounds
in particular inﬂuence the ability of an aerosol particle to
act as CCN. However, the interactions of organic species
with water vapour are largely unknown. K¨ohler theory has
been shown to apply for CCN composed of simple organic
molecules (Cruz and Pandis, 1997), but fails to describe more
complex organic species (e.g., Raymond and Pandis, 2003).
Organic compounds can introduce competing effects on the
activation behaviour of CCN by:
Alteration of surface tension: The presence of organic sur-
face active species, i.e., reductions in solution surface tension
relative to pure water, promotes CCN activation by decreas-
ing the critical supersaturation (Shulman et al., 1996; Fac-
chini et al., 1999a). Inorganic salts do not appreciably in-
crease surface tension in CCN (Pruppacher and Klett, 1980).
Facchini et al. (2000) have shown that humic-like com-
pounds have a more pronounced surface-active behaviour,
when compared to other class of compounds like mono- and
di-carboxylic acids. Another important factor determining
surface tension reduction is related to the amount of dis-
solved organic among the CCN size distribution and hence
is connected to the concentration and solubility properties of
surfactants in deliquescent particles (Rissman et al., 2004;
Decesari et al., 2003).
Contribution of solute: Organic compounds can contribute
soluble material to the growing particle and affect its growth.
Those with limited solubility can lead to a gradual dissolu-
tion of solute; this increases the amount of dissolved material
in the particle phase. The added soluble material will eventu-
ally facilitate the formation of a cloud droplet (e.g., Shulman
et al., 1996; Laaksonen et al., 1998). This results in equi-
librium curves with multiple maxima if the solubility limits
of the slightly soluble aerosol constituents are gradually ex-
ceeded, which can lead to large but stable drops that are typ-
ically assumed to be activated (Laaksonen et al., 1998). Hori
et al. (2003) pointed out that the critical supersaturations for
slightly water-soluble compounds could depend signiﬁcantly
on the initial particle phase (solid or liquid) that appears a key
factor to be determined in order to evaluate the actual CCN
ability for these compounds. In addition, the interaction be-
tween inorganic and organic compounds is not well under-
stood. Current approaches predict either profound (Clegg et
al., 2001) or negligible effects (Ming and Russell, 2001) on
the water activity within the aerosol. At present, thermo-
dynamic data for more realistic aerosol chemical composi-
tion are sparse. It should be noted however that the pres-
ence of some highly soluble material in the aerosol (such as
sulphate) can dominate the water uptake enough to diminish
the aforementioned complexities; nevertheless the contribu-
tion of slightly soluble salts to the activation properties of the
aerosol needs to be considered (Raymond and Pandis, 2003).
Affecting wettability: Recent work (Raymond and Pandis,
2002) shows that a pure organic compound, even with sol-
ubility less than 0.01 g cm−3, could be an efﬁcient CCN if
its contact angle with water is close to zero. It may be that
liquid water, because of the small contact angle, does not ef-
fectively come into contact with the soluble material to dis-
solve it; therefore the material never gets incorporated into
a droplet that may form on its surface and affect subsequent
water uptake. The effect of wettability may not be an issue
for ambient multi-component aerosol, which almost always

M. Kanakidou et al.: Organic aerosol and global climate modelling
contains wettable material, and thus can always form a ﬁlm
of liquid water that would dissolve substances of any contact
angle.
Affecting growth kinetics: It is known that ﬁlm monolayer
of certain compounds (called “ﬁlm-forming compounds-
FFC” by Feingold and Chuang, 2002) can inhibit the rate
of condensation and evaporation (Barnes, 1986; Rubel and
Gentry, 1984; Chuang, 2003). This inhibition is expressed
through the water accommodation coefﬁcient (Eq. A3). The
accepted value of the condensation coefﬁcient for water
vapour onto cloud droplets is ∼0.045, although the values
range considerably between studies (Pruppacher and Klett,
1980; Mozurkewich, 1986). The degree to which this inhibi-
tion occurs in ambient aerosol is highly uncertain, although
there is evidence for the existence of FFC compounds in am-
bient aerosol with a water accommodation coefﬁcient as low
as 10−5 (Chuang, 2003).
Slow growth kinetics can also arise from the presence
of compounds of limited solubility (Shulman et al., 1996;
Shantz et al., 2003). The existence of slowly-growing CCN,
depending on how the material is distributed among the
particle size distribution, can either decrease (Feingold and
Chuang, 2002) or increase droplet number (Nenes et al.,
2002b). There is increasing evidence that such hydropho-
bic ﬁlms (e.g., fatty acids) can have both biogenic and an-
thropogenic sources. In addition to these water-insoluble,
hydrophobic ﬁlms, there are indications, using dynamic sur-
face tension measurements that also water-soluble organics
accumulate at the air-water-interface (Decesari et al., 2003).
Quite often, an organic compound may exhibit many of
the aforementioned properties, leading to complex CCN be-
haviour. This complexity most likely explains the diversity
of conclusions with regard to the role of organics found in the
published literature (e.g., Mircea et al., 2002; Feingold 2003;
Nenes et al., 2002b; Ervens et al., 2004b; Rissman et al.,
2004). Understanding the effect of organics on CCN proper-
ties is important to assess their effect on cloud droplet num-
ber. Nevertheless, the relative inﬂuence of organic species on
cloud droplet formation strongly depends on the mass size
distribution of the organic aerosol, on the number size dis-
tribution and the dynamical conditions of cloud formation
(Nenes et al., 2002a, b; Rissman et al., 2004).
8.2
Representation of the water soluble organic compounds
(WSOC) in models
In the absence of chemical composition information, aerosol
WSOC is often assumed to be composed of compounds
which are not representative of ambient particulate matter.
This can clearly bias modelling studies that utilize an incom-
plete description of organic aerosol. For example, observa-
tions of surface tension depression in ambient cloud water
samples (Facchini et al., 1999a) show completely different
behaviour from aqueous solutions of monocarboxylic (Seidl,
2000) and dicarboxylic acids (Shulman et al., 1996) which
are typically used to represent ambient WSOC. Even if a
complete chemical characterization of aerosol was available,
the complexity and large number of compounds typically
found in aerosols would render it an almost intractable mod-
elling problem. Hence, there is the need for an appropriate
simpliﬁcation of the WSOC by assuming a mixture of a few
compounds that could capture most of the physicochemical
properties of the real organic mixture.
Several authors have speculated on the nature and origin
of the WSOC (e.g., Saxena and Hildemann, 1996; Pun et al.,
2000; Ervens et al., 2004a), but observations on speciation
of WSOC in ambient aerosol are sparse (Likens et al., 1983;
Kiss et al., 2001; Mayol-Bracero et al., 2002; Zappoli et al.,
1999; Facchini et al., 1999b). Historically, the speciation of
organic carbon is done by identiﬁcation of individual com-
pounds. However, this approach is labour-intensive and can
account for only a small fraction of the total aerosol mass.
Most importantly, such methods do not identify most of the
polar oxygenated organic fraction, which are the more water-
soluble species and thus, possibly CCN active (e.g., Rogge et
al., 1993).
An alternative approach to characterization of WSOC is
based on functional group analysis (Decesari et al., 2000;
Russell et al., 2002), which aims to characterize the rela-
tive abundance of functional groups that are responsible for
the WSOC chemical properties. Recently a procedure based
on functional group analysis (Decesari et al., 2000) to de-
rive a simpliﬁed model of WSOC fraction has been pro-
posed (Fuzzi et al., 2001). Quantitative measurements of or-
ganic carbon concentration and proton concentration of the
main functional groups contained in the aerosol WSOC mix-
ture are used to formulate a set of a few model compounds
(acidic, basic, neutrals), which can be used to simulate the
chemical and physical properties of water soluble organic
aerosol. The same conceptual method to derive model com-
pounds applied to Po Valley aerosol (Fuzzi et al. 2002) can
be used for other aerosol populations. The ultimate aim of
these studies is to represent the hygroscopicity, the chemical
reactivity and the physical and optical properties of OA with
the same model compounds and mixtures.

Optical properties of organics
To quantify the direct aerosol inﬂuence on the atmospheric
radiative balance the fundamental parameters to investigate
are the optical depth, τ, and the single scattering albedo
(SSA), ω (Hansen et al., 1997). The optical depth is the
extinction resulting from absorption and scattering of radi-
ation by the aerosols in a column and is directly dependent
on the aerosol amount. The spectral characteristics of τ are
required to model the radiative effects of aerosols, to retrieve
aerosol parameters from satellite remote sensing, and to cor-
rect for aerosol effects in remote sensing of the earth’s sur-
face. In a more detailed understanding of the inﬂuence of

different aerosol types on the radiative balance, the key pa-
rameter to be explored is the single scattering albedo (Hansen
et al., 1997). The single scattering albedo of a single particle
is deﬁned as:
ϖ =
Qscat
Qscat + Qabs
(18)
where Qscat and Qabs are the scattering and absorption efﬁ-
ciencies of the aerosol, commonly calculated by Mie theory
assuming spherical aerosols and adopting the aerosol com-
plex index of refraction and a size distribution.
The sin-
gle scattering albedo of aerosols is thus determined by the
aerosol size and its composition, that is by its complex in-
dex of refraction, ˜N(λ)=n(λ)+ik(λ); k(λ) is the wavelength
dependent absorption index and n(λ) is the corresponding
refractive index. The interpretation of the single scattering
albedo is that for ω=1 the aerosol investigated is totally scat-
tering and lower the global mean surface temperature; low
values of ω indicate that the aerosols will increase the global
mean surface temperature.
Several climate and radiative
model studies have investigated the turnover value and criti-
cal values in the range from 0.85–0.91 are reported (Hansen
et al., 1997; Haywood and Shine, 1995).
9.1
The optical properties of organic compounds present in
tropospheric aerosols
The single scattering albedo is strongly dependent on the re-
fractive and particularly the absorption index in the UV and
visible region. Until now, only soot (with high black carbon
content) aerosols are known to have a positive direct aerosol
forcing, increasing the surface temperature. Only a single
study exists on the complex index of refraction of various
organic aerosol components and mixtures representative of
atmospheric conditions (Myhre and Nielsen, 2004). Conse-
quently, the effect of the individual organic compounds in the
aerosols on the incoming solar radiation is characterized by
a large uncertainty.
Whereas data on the complex index of refraction of mix-
tures of organic components relevant to atmospheric aerosols
is sparse, there are several studies of pure organic liquids and
their absorption index and/or refractive index in the short

Jacobson (1999) investigated the inﬂuence of nitrated and
aromatic aerosols and gases on the extinction processes re-
sponsible for the reductions in the downward solar irradi-
ance in the Los Angeles region. The absorption index of
the aerosol components was derived at the wavelength of
strongest absorption from molar absorption spectra and re-
ported along with corresponding available refractive index
data. Table 11 contains a selection of the optical constants
reported by Jacobson (1999). All the components listed are
observed in the atmospheric particulate matter (Jacobson,
1999 and references therein), in particular in polluted re-
gions. The components with the highest absorption index
in each class of the organic compounds listed in Table 11 are
included in Fig. 7. As mentioned, Jacobson (1999) reported
only the absorption index at one wavelength – the one with
the maximum absorption index. Several of the components
will certainly have absorption tails in the 400–500 nm range;

the very strong absorbers like Benzo[e]pyrene, observed by
Rogge et al. (1993) in Los Angeles. Pure liquid nitro phe-
nol has an absorption index close to 0.1 at 400 nm (Jacob-
son, 1999); this value is also included in Fig. 7a. The work
of Jacobson (1999) clearly demonstrates that more labora-
tory data is needed as many of the components observed in
the tropospheric aerosols have high absorption indices in the
UV-region and with absorption tails in the visible region.

from 250–450 nm. Their study of lignin has relevance to at-
mospheric aerosols, and the results at selected wavelengths
are included in Fig. 7. R¨aty et al. (1999) presents the data of
lignin exclusively in graphical form showing maximum ab-
sorption at ∼290 nm. The samples were prepared by diluting
40 g lignin L−1 water and further concentrated by evaporat-
ing the initial volume to the half. They report an absorp-
tion index at 300 nm estimated to 0.005 decreasing to 0.002
at 350 nm. The corresponding values of n(λ) are 1.38 and
1.37, respectively; the values are included in Fig. 7 by solid
squares.
A series of studies report only the refractive index, n(λ), of
pure organic liquids. Marsh (1987) measured the refractive
index at 293 K of 1-Methylnaphthalene, toluene, and 2.2.4-
trimethylpentane at 7 selected wavelengths in the UV and
visible range. All the values are included in Fig. 7b as dif-
ferent symbols connected with lines. Li et al. (1994) have
measured the refractive index of liquid n-hexane and toluene
at 632.8 nm at 7 temperatures ranging from 15–45◦C. Their
results for toluene are in excellent agreement with those of
Marsh (1987) and their value for n-hexane is shown in the
ﬁgure by an open start. Bertie and Lan (1995) calculated
the refractive index of pure acetic acid, methanol, acetone,
dichloromethane, benzene, chlorobenzene and methylben-
zene in the UV-Visible region by extending the Kramers-
Kronig transformation of absorption indices obtained in the
infrared region. The results are presented in Fig. 7 as solid
and dotted lines. Unfortunately, they did not present absorp-
tion indices in the UV-region, only in the infrared region. El-
Kashef (1998) measured the refractive index of cyclohexane
in the range from 400–800 nm at 293 K; the results are only
presented in graphical form and selected values are included
in Fig. 7 by solid circles. The temperature dependence of
the refractive index in this wavelength range is reported to
be in the order of dn/dT=−5×10−4 K for all the investigated
pure organic components (Bertie and Lan, 1995; El-Kashef,
1998; Li et al., 1994). Various other studies of the refractive
index, n(λ), of organic liquids report values at one single
wavelength, 590 nm, and some of them are relevant to at-
mospheric conditions (Aminabhavi et al., 1996; Cases et al.,
2001; De Lorenzi et al., 1997; Gomez-Diaz et al., 2001; Rit-
zoulis and Fidantsi, 2000; Segade et al., 2003). The results
from these studies are consistent with the values presented in
Fig. 7b. Several of these studies investigate the refractive
index of binary organic liquids (Aminabhavi et al., 1996;
Cases et al., 2001; Gomez-Diaz et al., 2001; Segade et al.,
2003). Cases et al. (2001) investigated mixtures of formamid
and 3 carboxylic acids and Segade at al. (2003) investigated
the properties of octane mixed with 7 alkanols. The studies
show that the deviation from a linear mixing rule is less than
5×10−3 and that the largest deviations are observed in the
region around 0.5 mole fraction.
Recently Myhre and Nielsen (2004) reported the complex
index of refraction of several aqueous organic acids. They
investigated the absorption and refractive indices of aliphatic
dicarboxylic acids and aromatic acids. The concentrations
of the investigated samples ranged from highly diluted sam-
ples up to saturation concentrations. The organic acids in-
vestigated were the low molecular weight dicarboxylic acids:
oxalic, malonic, succinic, glutaric, hydroxymalonic acid, in
addition they investigated benzoic, phthalic and pinonic acid.
The results show that all the aliphatic acids have their absorp-
tion bands in the UV-region below 300 nm, except for pyru-
vic acid. Of the aromatic acids, phthalic acid is the one with
the highest absorption index. Pyruvic acid has an absorption
band at 328 nm and the absorption index for a 25 weight per-
cent (wt%) solution in water is reported as 1.2×10−4. In the
visible and near infrared region the absorption indices of all
the acids are nearly identical to that of ammonium sulphate
and essentially determined by the water band at 980 nm. The
results of 0.5 weight percent (wt%) phthalic acid and 25 wt%
pyruvic acid are included in Fig. 7a. Regarding the refrac-
tive index of the aqueous organic acids it is essentially de-
termined by the amount acid present, and not by any molec-
ular characteristics of the components. The refractive index
changes linearly with the total acid weight percent in the in-
vestigated concentration range; 0–60 wt% and the results of
50 wt% glutaric acid and 5 wt% pyruvic acid are shown in
Fig. 7b as fat solid and dotted grey lines.
9.2
The optical properties of mixtures of organic com-
pounds
In addition, Myhre and Nielsen (2004) calculated the single
scattering albedo, SSA, of some binary mixtures as well as
one complex mixture adopting the same size distribution as
normally used in modelling studies of sulphate aerosols. The
conclusion from these calculations was that all the investi-
gated organic acids have a pure scattering effect. They scat-
ter solar radiation similar to sulphate aerosols and they have
similar cooling effect on the climate. Nevertheless, in the
interpretation of the results it is important to remember that
at tropospheric conditions the saturation concentrations may
well be much higher than in the binary water/acid solutions
due to the other components present in the aerosol. This will
affect the absorption indices and in turn the SSA.
The content of organic components in fog water exhibits
a clear similarity to that observed for the water-soluble frac-
tion of the ﬁne mode aerosols collected in polluted areas as
the Po Valley, Italy (Fuzzi et al., 2002). Fog samples may
thus be considered as diluted aerosols samples. Myhre and
Nielsen (2003) have investigated the absorption index of fog
samples collected in the Po Valley and the results of the most
polluted sample is included in Fig. 7a. The results show that
the absorption index has a very broad tail into the visible re-
gion. However, the observed difference between the absorp-
tion index of water and the fog samples from the Po Valley
has negligible effect in the reduction of the single scattering
albedo of clouds and fog droplets. Consequently, the scatter-
ing and absorption properties of fog and clouds can be treated

as pure water in radiation calculations, even in polluted re-
gions. This is in line with the conclusion of Liu et al. (2002),
who investigated the presence of black carbon, BC, in cloud
droplets. They concluded that the observed BC mass concen-
trations are usually too low to reduce the cloud albedo in any
signiﬁcant way and their conclusion is in agreement with the
results of Twohy et al. (1989).
Schnaiter et al. (2003) investigated the impact of coating
of soot with organic material formed during ozonolysis of
a-pinene. They found strong increases of both the SSA and
the absorption cross section of the soot particles due to the
coating by SOA and concluded that global forcing by black
carbon aerosols should be revised to include the absorption
enhancement effect as suggested by Jacobson (2001).
10
Direct climatic impact of organic aerosol
The most simpliﬁed way to evaluate the radiative forcing of
the atmosphere resulting from OA in global models has been
the use of a constant extinction coefﬁcient for OA and the as-
sumption that OA and the other aerosol components are ex-
ternally mixed. This is the approach that has been followed in
the ﬁrst global study by Liousse et al. (1996), who assumed
a constant extinction coefﬁcient of OA within each one of
3 considered wavelength bands and allowed modiﬁcation of
the optical properties of OA by the presence of aerosol asso-
ciated water similar to that for sulphate aerosols.
Since then a lot of progress has been made (IPCC, 2001
and references therein). A relatively limited number of stud-
ies has investigated the direct radiative forcing resulting from
organic aerosol (IPCC, 2001 and references therein, Myhre et
al., 2001; Takemura et al., 2001; Chung and Seinfeld, 2002)
and among them only one (Chung and Seinfeld, 2002) has
explicitly treated the occurrence of SOA in the troposphere.
In these studies of radiative forcing, the required optical
properties of the aerosols i.e. extinction coefﬁcient, single
scattering albedo (SSA) and asymmetry factors are deter-
mined by Mie theory calculations that require wavelength
and size dependent refractive indices of aerosols. For these
calculations the refractive indices of the individual aerosol
components are needed as well as the assumed dry mass den-
sity and size distribution of aerosols. The wavelength bands
used for the radiative calculations vary, in number and size,
from one model to the other. Kinne et al. (2003) present a
very comprehensive evaluation of 7 global models consider-
ing at least 5 aerosol components including OA, by compar-
ison with satellite and AERONET ground-based data. The
reader is referred to Kinne et al. (2003) for an overview of
the major differences that can exist between models with re-
gard to the above mentioned parameters that determine the
overall aerosol optical properties on which replies the cal-
culated climatic impact of aerosols. The ongoing AERO-
COM intercomparison exercise (http://nansen.ipsl.jussieu.fr/
AEROCOM) is expected to go a step further and quantify the
contribution of the various factors to the overall uncertainty
in the latest radiative forcing calculations.
Hereafter we aim to provide a summary of how differ-
ent models are treating the OA for direct forcing calcula-
tions. When comparing the extinction coefﬁcients at a spe-
ciﬁc wavelength used for OA in global models (when this in-
formation is available), one can notice a factor of 3–4 differ-
ence in the adopted values. For instance, Liousse et al. (1996)
assumed a speciﬁc extinction coefﬁcient of 4 m2 g−1 (at
550 µm) for dry OA that was considered to be purely scat-
tering, whereas Cooke et al. (1999) adopted a slightly lower
value of 3.6 m2 g−1 (at 500 µm), SSA of 0.98 (slightly ab-
sorbing OA from fossil fuel) and effective radius of 0.02 µm.
Koch et al. (2001) used a speciﬁc extinction coefﬁcient for
OA of 8 m2 g−1 (at 550 µm) to account for neglecting the
water uptake by organics, SSA of 0.96 and effective radius
of 0.5 µm. Chung and Seinfeld (2002) used an extinction
coefﬁcient of 2.53 m2 g−1 for dry OA, SSA of 0.94 and ef-
fective radius of 0.5 µm. These assumptions affect the calcu-
lated direct radiative global forcing of OA since they apply
to the OA distributions computed on the basis of emissions,
chemistry, transport and deposition processes as discussed in
the previous sections.
Another important source of differences in the radiative
forcing calculations for OA is the consideration or not of
the water associated to that aerosol. Although, there is not
always sufﬁcient information on whether and how the wa-
ter uptake by OA has been taken into account in the mod-
els. Chung and Seinfeld (2002) calculated an increase by
−0.09 Wm−2 in the radiative forcing at the top of the atmo-
sphere since preindustrial time produced by wet OA com-
pared with that calculated for the dry OA (−0.09 Wm−2).
This difference seems to apply also when mixtures (exter-
nal or internal) of aerosols are considered and points to the
importance of understanding the interactions between OA
and water in the atmosphere as described above. Note that
there is important spatial and temporal variability in this
forcing. In addition, the consideration of internally mixed
aerosol (ammonium sulphate, and carbonaceous) is lowering
the calculated cooling direct climate effect of aerosols com-
pared with the externally mixed aerosol case (from −0.78 to
−0.48 W m−2).
Indeed, the consideration of internal mixing of aerosols
has been recently shown critical for forcing estimates (Ja-
cobson, 2001a; Lesins et al., 2002). Recent observational
data show the drastic enhancement of BC absorption when it
is coated by soluble material (Schaiter et al., 2003). Lesins et
al. (2002) estimated that for speciﬁc internal mixing assump-
tions nearly all of the cooling effect predicted for the external
mixture is counterbalanced by the BC absorption enhance-
ment.
This points to the importance of consideration of the mix-
ing state of the aerosol. However, signiﬁcant gaps exist in
the knowledge of the optical and the hygroscopic behaviour

of internally mixed aerosols, especially the involvement of
organic aerosol compounds.
Future model investigations, forcing estimates and atmo-
spheric chemistry simulations need to consider the physical
mixing of its individual components and the interactions be-
tween them.
11
Indirect climatic impact of organic aerosol
Indirect effects of aerosols on climate refer to the various
mechanisms by which aerosols can perturb the albedo of the
Earth’s clouds. In this section we ﬁrst give a general descrip-
tion of the indirect effect and then focus on the role of OA.
Twomey (1959, 1977) identiﬁed what is generally referred
to as the ﬁrst indirect effect, in which increased cloud con-
densation nucleus (CCN) concentrations result in increased
cloud drop concentrations, smaller drop radii, and more re-
ﬂective clouds.
Albrecht (1989) noted that a decrease in
cloud drop effective radius may lead to lower coalescence
rates, hence reduced precipitation and a longer cloud life-
time and greater spatial extent, a phenomenon that is some-
times referred to as the second indirect effect. Boers and
Mitchell (1994) and Pincus and Baker (1994) noted that
changes in cloud microphysics and precipitation alter the ra-
diative cooling and latent heating within a cloud. Hansen
et al. (1997) identiﬁed a so-called “semi-direct” effect, in
which changes in the thermal structure of the atmosphere re-
sulting from aerosol solar absorption (principally by black
carbon) suppress cloud formation. Black carbon heating can
also affect cloud albedo through an alteration of the cloud
condensation nucleus (CCN) spectrum during cloud forma-
tion (Conant et al., 2002; Nenes et al., 2002b). Changes in
cold ice-cloud microphysical and radiative properties in re-
sponse to changing atmospheric aerosol concentrations have
also been postulated (Jensen and Toon, 1992; DeMott et al.,
1994, 1997), although in this case ice nucleating (IN) parti-
cles, rather than CCN, are the relevant aerosol particles. In
situ measurements revealed that organic-containing aerosols
are less abundant than sulphate aerosols in ice cloud par-
ticles, suggesting that organics do not freeze preferentially
(Cziczo et al., 2004). A model study explained this ﬁnding
by the disparate water uptake of organic aerosols, and sug-
gests that organics are unlikely to signiﬁcantly modify cir-
rus formation unless they are present in very high concentra-
tions (compared to sulphate-rich particles) at low tempera-
tures and hamper water condensation (Kaercher and Koop,
2005).
Relative to present-day understanding of aerosol-
CCN-cloud linkages, much less is known about the nature
of IN, their sources, and their indirect effects on cold clouds
(IPCC, 2001).
The number of CCN is a critical link between aerosols,
clouds, and precipitation. Since clouds are effective reﬂec-
tors of incoming solar radiation, even small perturbations in
their properties can signiﬁcantly impact the amount of solar
radiation absorbed by the planet, and thus affect climate. It
is currently thought that aerosol-cloud interactions have a net
cooling effect; quantitative estimates are highly uncertain,
of the order of the greenhouse warming effect itself (IPCC,
2001).
There are two reasons for the large uncertainty associated
with the indirect effect.
– The ﬁrst originates from the wide range of length scales
involved in cloud-aerosol interactions: from hundreds
of kilometres (that of the largest cloud systems) down
to tens of meters (that of individual updrafts responsible
for production of new drops).
– The other reason is our poor understanding of the distri-
bution of global CCN.
General Circulation Models (GCMs) are far from being able
to resolve the scales involved in cloud formation.
Much
of the properties of warm clouds can be estimated if the
relationship between aerosol and cloud droplet number is
known. The ﬁrst global climate modelling studies used an
empirical approach, with cloud droplet number concentra-
tion being linked to a property available in a global aerosol
model, such as total aerosol sulphate mass (e.g., Boucher
and Lohmann, 1995), or total aerosol number (e.g., Gul-
tepe and Isaac, 1996).
Relating one bulk aerosol charac-
teristic to cloud droplet number is subject to signiﬁcant un-
certainty. For example, in the RACE subset of the Gultepe
and Isaac (1996) observations, the cloud droplet number con-
centration may range from 50 to 400 cm−3, for an aerosol
number concentration of 800 cm−3. This variability in cloud
droplet concentration leads to a signiﬁcant uncertainty in the
prediction of cloud radiative properties. This is illustrated by
the Kiehl et al. (2000) study of the ﬁrst indirect aerosol effect,
in which several different empirical relationships yield esti-
mates of the global annual average indirect forcing ranging
between −0.40 and −1.78 W m−2. The scatter in empiri-
cal aerosol-cloud droplet number correlations indicates that
cloud droplet number can be strongly inﬂuenced by factors
other than e.g., aerosol number or sulphate mass. One factor
contributing to this scatter can be the presence of organics as
discussed in Sect. 7.
Recently, ﬁrst-principles approaches to predicting cloud
droplet number have emerged (e.g., Ghan et al., 1997;
Lohmann et al., 1999; Jacobson, 2003, 2004), in which
a cloud droplet number balance in each GCM grid cell
is established.
Lohmann et al. (2000) have used this ap-
proach in a GCM. They evaluated the 1st and 2nd indi-
rect effect due to sulphate and carbonaceous aerosols be-
tween −1.1 W m−2 for an internally-mixed aerosol and
−1.5 Wm−2 for an externally-mixed aerosol. They attributed
this difference mainly to the increased climatic impact of car-
bonaceous aerosol when externally mixed aerosol is consid-
ered, due to higher atmospheric loadings and smaller particle
sizes. The impact of the semi-direct effect was discussed by

several authors (Lohmann and Feichter, 2001; Penner et al.,
2003) who found it only of minor importance at the top-of-
the-atmosphere and of uncertain sign. Penner et al. (2003)
and Johnson et al. (2004a) pointed out that the semi-direct
effect can result in a cooling depending on the location of
BC in the vertical with respect to the cloud.
Chuang et al. (2002) estimated the impact of BC absorp-
tion in clouds to globally change the ﬁrst indirect effect by
less than 0.07 W m−2, whereas locally it could decrease the
forcing by as much as 0.7 W m−2 in regions where BC emis-
sions are pronounced. However, this estimate does not in-
clude the recently discovered enhancement of BC absorption
due to coating by organics (Schnaiter et al., 2003). Chuang
et al. (2002) estimated the total ﬁrst indirect forcing to be
−1.85 W m−2, with −0.30 W m−2 associated with anthro-
pogenic sulfate, −1.16 W m−2 associated with carbonaceous
aerosols from biomass burning, and 0.52 W m−2 associ-
ated with carbonaceous aerosols from fossil fuel combustion.
They also found that the ﬁrst indirect forcing of aerosols was
also sensitive to the loading of natural SOA. They found that
the ﬁrst indirect forcings for suphate and for carbonaceous
are reduced from −0.31 to −0.26 W m−2 and from −1.67
to −1.27 W m−2, respectively, when the SOA source is in-
creased by a factor of 5 from 8.4 to 42 Tg y−1. This study as-
sumed that all SOA is formed in the boundary layer, although
as discussed in the introduction, signiﬁcant part of SOA is
formed in the free troposphere. Therefore, this assumption
introduces additional uncertainties since Penner et al. (2003)
have shown that climate forcing depends signiﬁcantly on the
altitude of the injections of the aerosols since higher injec-
tions increase the aerosol lifetimes and subsequently their
burden. They found that higher-altitude injections of biomass
burning carbonaceous aerosols tend to enhance the negative
longwave forcing and BC aerosols injected at high altitudes
can increase cloudiness at lower altitudes, where tempera-
ture may decrease. Moreover, Chuang et al. (2002) showed
that indirect forcing is overestimated when some of natural
or anthropogenic aerosols are omitted.
– Few global climate modelling studies evaluated the in-
direct climatic impact of carbonaceous aerosols.
– It has been found that when neglecting the other types of
aerosols, the climatic impact of carbonaceous aerosols
is overestimated.
– The calculated ﬁrst indirect forcing is sensitive to the
SOA global chemical production as well as to the other
natural aerosol components.
– The evaluation of the impact of SOA on the indirect ef-
fect calculations relies on our understanding of the in-
volvement of organic aerosol compounds in the hygro-
scopic behaviour of internally mixed aerosols and re-
quires improvement (see Sect. 8).
– The effect of enhanced absorption by BC on cloud prop-
erties when BC is coated by organics has to be consid-
ered in the indirect forcing calculations as well as the
involvement of SOA on CCN formation and growth and
thus on cloud occurrence and properties.
The different approaches to estimate the global indirect cli-
matic aerosol effects are discussed by Lohmann and Fe-
ichter (2005).

Datasets of particulate organic carbon for evaluation
of global models
The following discusses the ‘traditional’ ground based ob-
servations that can provide information on speciﬁc aerosol
component. As stated and well documented in the review
paper by Jacobson et al. (2000), the sampling, extraction,
and analysis techniques in use inﬂuence what we know about
atmospheric organic aerosols., since what we ﬁnd in the or-
ganic fraction is to a large extent determined by how we look.
The reader is directed to this earlier review for an extensive
discussion on these topics. The present work focuses the dis-
cussion mainly on the major sources of uncertainties that in-
ﬂuence global modeling results and their evaluation.
12.1
Ground based observations of OC
About 10 years ago, the world wide distribution of organic
aerosols was poorly known because of the lack of long
term datasets.
One of the ﬁrst particulate organic carbon
(OC) data compilation by Liousse et al. (1996) relied on
OC measurements from a quite large number of sampling
sites (21) but most of them (13) covered only a period of
1–2 months. This was nevertheless enough to show that or-
ganic matter is a ubiquitous and signiﬁcant constituent of

the aerosol. During the last decade, organic (and elemen-
tal) carbon started to be more commonly measured over
longer time periods. In a recent compilation of long term
aerosol chemistry data sets produced in Europe (Putaud et
al., 2003, 2004) OC measurements were included in 10 of
the 16 compiled data sets.
Recently, OC measurements
have been added to the EMEP monitoring program, for a
limited amount of the EMEP super-sites only though (http:
//www.nilu.no/projects/ccc/). In the USA a number of mea-
suring networks provide OC data. Organic carbon and chem-
ical speciation measurements have been included in the mea-
surements program of the EPA super sites. One of the oldest
continuous ones is the IMPROVE (Interagency Monitoring at
Protected Visual Environments) data set with measurements
in background sites (http://vista.cira.colostate.edu/improve).
The network has currently 150 sites and collects information
about aerosol composition and optical properties. Some of
the sites have collected more than 15 years of data. Fig-
ure 8 shows the estimated spatial patterns of OC and the
locations of PM monitoring sites (Malm, 2000). The map
was produced using data from only the background sites so
it does not include the major industrial areas. Concentra-
tions of OC and elemental carbon (EC or as used in this doc-
ument black carbon: BC, see discussion below) in mainly
urban and sub-urban areas in the US are measured by the
Speciation and Trends Network (STN). The measurements
started in 2001 and include around 200 stations around the
country. PMEL Atmospheric Chemistry Data Server con-
tains OC (and BC) data for most cruises in the Atlantic, Pa-
ciﬁc, Antarctic and Indian Ocean since 1997. To our knowl-
edge, long term OC (and EC/BC) measurements have also
been performed in South America (de Almeida Azevedo et
al., 2002; Tsapakis et al., 2002) and South East Asia (Kim
et al., 2000; Sau and Khalil, 1993).
The WMO-WDCA
(http://rea.ei.jrc.it/netshare/wilson/WDCA) is currently aim-
ing at compiling all these long term aerosol data sets in a
common format to make them available to the community.
This should increase the number of available extensive OC
data sets in the next future.
12.2
Deﬁnition problem
A possible source of systematic error in particulate OC de-
termination arises from the difﬁculty of separating OC and
EC/BC. Actually, the border between these two “species”
is only instrumentally deﬁned. For Chow et al. (1993), OC
evolves at up to 520◦C in inert career gas, and EC/BC from
520 to 650◦C in an oxidant career gas. The two major pro-
tocols for OC and BC split (in US) are the NIOSH and
IMPROVE protocols (see references in Chow et al., 1993).
There are also variations of these protocols using different
temperature proﬁles. Charring, the transformation of OC to
BC during the thermal analysis which is dependent on an-
alytical condition and sampling substrate nature, can also
strongly affect the reported OC/BC partitioning. Several in-
tercomparisons showed that differences in OC/BC split def-
inition and in charring amplitude and/or correction lead to
large interlaboratory variability in EC/BC determination of
up to a factor of 3 (Turpin et al., 1990; Schmid et al., 2001).
As a consequence, the difference in OC determination from
two different techniques can be as high as a factor of 2. The
OC averages determined with various methods and normal-
ized to the thermo-optical reﬂectance method are shown in
Table 12. Differences in averages can reach >50%. It is
surprising that methods accounting for charring could lead
to lower OC values than other methods in the intercompari-
son described by Countess (1990), contrary to what was ob-
served in a previous intercomparison (Groblicki et al., 1983).
The intercomparisons based on sample collected in Europe
(Schmid et al., 2000; ten Brink et al., 2004) showed in con-

12.3
Analytical problems
OC measurements may be seriously affected by various arti-
facts at the sampling and analysis stages (Turpin et al., 2000).
Sampling artifacts have been extensively studied in the
USA. Several sampling methods (ﬁltration, adsorption- cor-
rected ﬁltration, impaction) compared in Hering et al. (1990)
showed up to 70% differences in single samples.
Also
Eatough et al. (1993) showed that sampling in Utah (USA)
with heated quartz ﬁber ﬁlters may lead to 20–80% negative
artifacts and up to 50% positive artifacts in single samples.
The OC averages (over 18 samples) obtained by Hering et
al. (1990) with various sampling methods and normalized to
the results obtained from sampling with a plain undenuded
quartz ﬁber ﬁlter at a face velocity of ca. 38 cm/s are com-
pared in Table 12. Normalized concentrations ranged from
0.49 to 1.34 in the Los Angeles Basin. These results may
not be valid for other locations, since sampling artifacts are
expected to depend on the aerosol (gaseous and particulate)
carbonaceous species mixture and on meteorological condi-
tions. Indeed, Mader et al. (2003) and ten Brink et al. (2004)
found different results for positive artifact corrected quartz
ﬁlter data in Easten Asia and impactors in Europe, respec-
tively (Table 13).
The artifact-free wet annular denuder-steam jet aerosol
collector combination (WAD-SJAC) with on-line analysis of
total OC is a promising method for OC measurement. Such
an instrument was tested during the Intercomp2000 experi-
ment in Germany (ten Brink et al., 2004) and led to results,
which tend to indicate that positive OC sampling artifacts on
ﬁlters were predominant at this site. However, such a kind
of artifact free combination is not very suited for long term
monitoring programs, and does not permit to collect enough
organic material for speciation. Various ﬁlter-based devices
have nevertheless been proposed to limit and/or assess posi-
tive and negative sampling artifacts when using quartz ﬁber
ﬁlters. Positive artifacts were addressed through the back-to-
back ﬁlter technique (Fitz, 1990; Novakov et al., 1997), the
Teﬂon + quartz/quartz simultaneous sampling method (Mc
Dow and Huntzicker, 1990; Chow et al., 1996), or the use
of diffusion denuders, in which sorbents were quartz (Fitz,
1990) or carbon impregnated paper strips (Eatough et al.,
1989, 1993, 1996; Tang et al., 1994), activated Al2O3 (Ap-
pel et al., 1989), or XAD-4 (Mader et al., 2001, 2003; Fan
et al., 2003). The use of a denuder shifts the gas/particle
equilibrium of semi-volatile organic compounds, and renders
the assessment of negative artifacts essential. Negative ar-
tifacts were determined by trapping the organic molecules
volatilized from the particles upstream quartz ﬁber ﬁlter in
sorbent like carbon impregnated glass ﬁber ﬁlters (Eatough
et al., 1993, 1996, 2001; Tang et al., 1994), XAD-4 impreg-
nated quartz ﬁber ﬁlters (Fan et al., 2003), or poly-urethane
foams (Kavouras et al., 1999). However, these combinations
do not always solve completely the problem. First of all,
the denuder efﬁciency is sometimes not 100%, and may vary
with time and meteorological conditions. Their efﬁciency
should therefore be continuously monitored, though parallel
monitoring of particle-free ambient air, which makes this ap-
proach quite labor intensive. Second, none of these sorbents
can withstand temperatures higher than 450◦C for a few tens
of seconds.
Although, volatile or semi-volatile species trapped in the
sorbents are expected to have a relatively low boiling point
(<300◦C), this temperature limitation might prevent the evo-
lution of the whole trapped OC. Indeed, analysis of quartz
back up ﬁlter with the EGA method (20◦C min−1 ramp from
50 to 650◦C in oxygen career gas) shows that a large fraction
of non particulate OC is evolved in the 300–500◦C temper-
ature range (Kirchstetter et al., 2001). Another approach to
tackle OC sampling artifacts consists in using particle con-

centrators like a simple virtual impactor with a low 50%
cut-off or a more complex device based on the same aero-
dynamic particle segregation principle (Sioutas et al., 1999).
Without eliminating sampling artifacts, particle concentra-
tion can considerably lower them, by discarding >70% of the
air stream while keeping most particles in the sample ﬂow.
Particle concentrators have been used in combination with
diffusion denuders and sorbents to increase their efﬁciency
(e.g., Tang et al., 1994).
Unfortunately, despite the demonstrated occurrence of sig-
niﬁcant sampling artifacts and the description of remedies in
the literature, numerous OC measurements published up to
now have been performed without accounting for possible
artifacts. This is perhaps due to the fact that artifact free
sampling systems are complicated, not commercially avail-
able, and above all not always well characterized in vari-
ous environments (Turpin et al., 2000). Such devices are not
widely available and have to be used as reference techniques.
However, as sampling artifacts are expected to depend on the
OC mixture, ﬁlter type, temperature and relative humidity, it
seems difﬁcult to correct older non-artifact free OC data.
12.4
Mass-to-Carbon ratio
Mass closure experiment can increase our conﬁdence on the
overall accuracy in organic aerosol concentrations. On the
top of providing an opportunity of determining the sources
and amplitude of random uncertainties, mass closure experi-
ments can indeed constrain OC measurements when (1) over-
all random uncertainties in aerosol mass and component con-
centrations are small enough and (2) aerosol mass and com-
ponent concentrations are determined independently. How-
ever, assessing the aerosol mass concentration from the sum
of its components necessitates accounting for the non-carbon
atoms contained in the particulate organic matter. This is
usually done by using an OC-OM conversion factor, ex-
pected to represent the mean molecular mass -to- carbon
mass ratio of the particulate organic matter. Values rang-
ing from 1.2 to 1.7 have been used in the past.
Turpin
and Lim (2001) concluded that ratios of 1.6±0.2 for urban
aerosol and 2.1±0.2 for non-urban aerosol appear more ac-
curate, but Russell (2003) found a mean ratio of 1.4±0.2 for
samples collected in Asia and the Caribbean (Table 14). Ac-
tually, to really constrain OC measurements, each mass clo-
sure experiment should include a precise and independent
determination of the aerosol mass concentration, of all the
aerosol components’ concentration, and of the OC-OM con-
version ratio to be applied. Such a work is quite demanding,
but necessary to demonstrate experimental OC data quality.
A laborious task in atmospheric aerosol modeling is to
evaluate the accuracy of the models and identify and quan-
tify their uncertainties. A ﬁrst step in evaluation of the model
results can be achieved by comparison with data of total or-
ganic particulate mass.
In addition:
– Chemical speciation may provide valuable informa-
tion on the major sources contributing to the observed
aerosol (by using appropriate tracer compounds) and
therefore can indicate model deﬁciencies and improve
parameterisations.
– Chemical characterisation of organics based on func-
tional group analysis (Sect. 8.2) and allowing the de-
scription of the total organic aerosol based on a set
of few compounds (acid, basic, neutral) is a promis-
ing measuring approach that can allow the evaluation of
models, especially with regard to cloud formation prop-
erties, when appropriately designed.
Size resolved aerosol mass, number and chemical compo-
sition information will allow evaluation of the calculated
aerosol distributions. Additional information on absorption
and scattering of the radiation is required to evaluate the opti-
cal properties of the aerosol mixtures computed by the mod-
els. The last years a lot of effort concentrated on compari-
son of model results with satellite observations that provide
a ‘global’ view of the atmosphere. However, although crit-
ical for understanding atmospheric chemistry, satellite data
cannot be used to evaluate the accuracy of the model simula-
tions of one aerosol component like the organic aerosol since
they provide aerosol optical thickness data that integrate all
aerosol constituents in the tropospheric column.
– It is the synergistic use of ground based, aircraft and re-
mote sensing observations that will allow optimal eval-
uation of global model capabilities in simulating global
organic aerosol distributions (see example by Kinne et
al., 2003).

Estimation of SOA from ﬁeld observations
Estimating the SOA concentration from ﬁeld observations re-
mains a challenging task. Unfortunately there is no direct
method for measuring SOA. Field measurements of OC pro-
vide just an upper bound that is the maximum possible con-
centration of SOA in the corresponding area.
Since primary OC and EC are mostly emitted from the
same sources, EC can be used as a tracer for primary
combustion-generated OC (Gray et al., 1986; Turpin and
Huntzicker, 1995; Strader et al., 1999). The formation of
SOA increases the ambient concentration of OC and the am-
bient OC/EC ratio. OC/EC ratios exceeding the expected
primary emission ratio are an indication of SOA formation.
Primary ratios of OC and EC vary from source to source
and show temporal and diurnal patterns, but since EC is
only emitted from combustion sources, gaseous tracers of
combustion (CO, NO, NOx) can be used to determine pe-
riods dominated by primary aerosol emissions (Cabada et
al., 2004). Ozone is an indicator of photochemical activity,
and it also can be used as a tracer for periods where sec-
ondary organic aerosol production is expected. In this case,
increases in the OC/EC ratio correlated to ozone episodes
are indicative of SOA production. The major weakness of
the method is its reliance on the assumption of a constant
primary OC/EC during the analysis period.
Variations of
sources strengths, meteorology, etc. are expected to change
the primary OC/EC. This assumption can be relaxed if there
are high temporal resolution data by grouping the data by
period of day, month, etc. In any case, this variability in-
troduces signiﬁcant uncertainties in the estimated SOA con-
centration. Even if such an almost constant ratio exists, its
determination is non-trivial. The primary OC/EC ratio is pri-
marily determined either from measurements during periods
where the primary sources dominate the ambient OC or from
emission inventories (Gray, 1986; Cabada et al., 2002). Once
more the existence of measurements every 2-4 hr reduces sig-
niﬁcantly the uncertainty of the estimated SOA concentration
(Cabada et al., 2004). An upper limit of the SOA concen-
tration can also be estimated based on the unexplained OC
during the use of the CMB approach and organic speciation
measurements (Zheng et al., 2002).
Measurements of the SOA product concentrations could
be helpful in estimating the SOA concentrations using obser-
vations. However, one needs to be careful because a lot of
these species continue reacting in the atmosphere and there-
fore are not conserved as SOA tracers.
Constraining the global SOA production remains quite
challenging. Most current estimates are based on measure-
ments of the OC concentrations, the fraction of the OC that
is primary and the lifetime of OC in the atmosphere. All
these (as described in various sections of the paper) are quite
uncertain. There are relatively few OC measurements with
signiﬁcant uncertainties due to sampling and analytical is-
sues. In addition, the fraction of the organic aerosol that is
secondary is quite uncertain especially in the more polluted
continental regions. Finally the lifetime of the OC is a lot
more uncertain compared to that of the inorganic salts (see
Sect. 4.3). The result is that estimates of the global SOA
production based on observations are as uncertain as these
of the models. This demonstrates the large uncertainties and
difﬁculties in evaluating the SOA modeling.
13
Conclusions
Our understanding of the organic aerosols in the atmosphere
has been signiﬁcantly improved during the last decade al-
though signiﬁcant gaps remain. The present paper did not
aim to refer to all the experimental and modelling studies on
organic aerosol (OA) but to i) summarize the recent under-
standing of the occurrence and behaviour of OA in the atmo-
sphere with focus on the secondary organic aerosol (SOA), ii)
point out the uncertainties related to the relevant extra simpli-
ﬁed parameterisations used in the global chemistry transport
and climate models and iii) identify areas where further re-
search is needed.
What do we know?
– The major SOA precursors are biogenic VOC. The an-
thropogenic contribution to the SOA formation is small
on a global scale, although it can be important in pol-
luted regions.
– At the global scale chemical formation of SOA could be
at least 50% of the primary OA emissions.
– The known chemical mechanisms that form SOA are
– Gas phase OH, NO3, O3 reactions. There is am-
ple evidence that the ozonolysis reactions are major
contributors to SOA formation.
– Heterogeneous reactions that result in the decrease
of the volatility of the semi- volatile compounds
that are portioned between aerosol and gas phase.
– Aqueous phase reactions can be a signiﬁcant source
of dicarboxylic acids.
– The major aerosol compounds resulting from a-pinene
and b-pinene gas phase oxidation have been identiﬁed
and there is knowledge on the chemical mechanisms
leading to non-volatile products.
– Few global climate modelling studies evaluated the in-
direct climatic impact of carbonaceous aerosols compa-
rable to sulphate that has been extensively studied.
– It has been found that when neglecting the other types of
aerosols, the climatic impact of carbonaceous aerosols
is overestimated.
Of what do we have only a qualitative, not sufﬁcient under-
standing?

– The nature and the role of products less volatile than
pinic acid (“the nucleating species”) remains unclear
although they are expected not to be among the major
aerosol constituents.
– The emissions of sesquiterpenes that have very high
aerosol potential and the chemical composition of
aerosol particles produced from them, remains poorly
known.
– Large uncertainties exist in the emission inventories of
primary carbonaceous aerosols. These uncertainties are
mostly due to temporal-regional-sectorial attribution of
emission factors to activities, but also due to differences
in measurement techiniques used to determine these
emission factors.
– The emission inventories of the gaseous organics that
have been identiﬁed as precursors of SOA, are also sub-
ject to serious uncertainties dominated by those in the
emission rates and the missing pieces of information on
chemical speciation of the emissions (e.g. the fast react-
ing sesquiterpenes).
– Although the thermodynamics involved in the partition-
ing between the gas and particulate phase are under-
stood, there is a need for experimental data on the en-
thalphy of evaporisation of the semi-volatile organics
that partition on the aerosol phase.
– The removal of carbonaceous aerosols from the atmo-
sphere depends largely on the conversion of the hy-
drophobic to hydrophilic aerosols that is not satisfac-
torily known and parameterised in the models. Like for
all other aerosol components it is expected that the wet
deposition parameterisation used in models is a major
source for uncertainty in the amount of SOA residing in
the atmosphere.
– Actual estimates of global SOA formation range from
12 to 70 Tg SOA y−1. The reduction of this uncertainty
requires improved and chemically speciated emission
inventories, better understanding of the chemical pro-
cesses forming SOA and description of the size distri-
bution of the aerosols in the global models.
– Some knowledge on the hygroscopicity and optical
properties of individual organics exists and requires fur-
ther measurements. Additional data are needed on the
optical properties of internally mixed aerosols and their
hygroscopic behaviour, especially of organic aerosol
compounds.
– At low relative humidities (below about 50%) SOA
could account for 20% of the aerosol water. Data on the
interactions between inorganic and organic compounds
and their impact on water activity within the aerosol are
missing.
– The role of organic aerosol in micro-physical cloud and
rain processes is qualitatively understood but requires
further understanding. The thermodynamic properties
of potentially CCN active organics in aerosols are not
sufﬁciently documented.
– The calculated climatic forcing seems to be sensitive to
the SOA global chemical production as well as to the
other natural aerosol components.
What are the emerging topics?
– Recent developments both on aerosol sampling and
chemical analysis resulted in new ﬁndings that show
the formation of low volatility oligomers and polymers.
These ﬁndings may lead to signiﬁcant changes in the
current SOA modelling approaches. The separation be-
tween the primary and secondary organic aerosol com-
ponents becomes more difﬁcult after the recent detec-
tion of oligomers in SOA since compounds that have
been considered of primary origin might be chemically
produced.
– Compounds that were previously not considered as
aerosol precursors have been suggested to contribute
signiﬁcantly to the SOA mass in the atmosphere (e.g.
isoprene). More examples will probably be identiﬁed in
the near future.
– Aqueous phase chemistry –cloud processing of aerosols
identiﬁed as a possibly important source of SOA, the
strength of which requires evaluation.
– The coating of BC by SOA results in a strong increase
of both the Single Scattering Albedo and the absorption
cross section of the soot particles that has to be consid-
ered in climate forcing studies.
– Recent results (O’Dowd et al., 2004) have indicated a
new POA source connected to biological activity in the
ocean which produces submicrometre particles. Its im-
portance and inﬂuence on marine CCN require further
work.
What is the consequence for (future) climate modelling?
– It has been found that the neglect of the other types of
aerosols leads to an overestimate in the impact of car-
bonaceous aerosols. The consideration of internal mix-
ing of aerosols has been recently shown critical for forc-
ing estimates, in general smaller effects are calculated
when the internally mixed aerosol is considered since
internal mixing affects both aerosol lifetime and prop-
erties.
– The evaluation of the climatic impact of OA (both
primary and secondary) relies on our understanding
of the involvement of organic aerosol compounds in

M. Kanakidou et al.: Organic aerosol and global climate modelling
the hygroscopic behaviour of internally mixed aerosols
that has to be improved. It requires consideration of
OA interactions with the other aerosol constituents and
aerosol associated water. Such interactions are altering
the absorptive and scattering properties of the aerosol,
their hygroscopicity and their ability to form CCN
– Appropriate parameterisations need to be developed to
allow incorporation of information about the direct (op-
tical properties) and indirect effect (CCN activity) of
OA in the global models that are actually treating OA
in a very simpliﬁed way.
– The development of SOA precursor gas emissions under
future climate regimes and land-use is probably impor-
tant, but up-to-date only a few speculative studies are
available.
What are the key priorities for research?
– There is an open question whether the laboratory stud-
ies of SOA with relatively high concentrations of pre-
cursor molecules and oxidants are also valid under real
atmospheric conditions or not. Recent laboratory stud-
ies have pointed out the inﬂuence of OH-scavenger and
Criegee-intermediate scavenger (e.g. water) on aerosol
yieds during ozonolysis experiments. These observa-
tions have to be considered to carefully translate cham-
ber experiment results to atmospheric conditions. In this
perspective, the impact of NOx levels on the aerosol
yields and the ﬁnal products of the photooxidation re-
actions has to be investigated.
– Most modeling studies rely on arbitrary chosen model
compounds to represent the hygroscopicity or optical
properties of the (S)OA-inorganic aerosol mixture. The
use of model compounds constructed based on experi-
mental information could provide more realistic repre-
sentation of the properties of the OA mixture.
– The involvement of organics in the new particle forma-
tion deserves further studies to determine its importance
on regional and global scales. The nature of products
less volatile than pinic acid (“the nucleating species”)
remains an open question although they are expected
not to be among the major aerosol constituents.
– More studies on sesquiterpenes-temperature depen-
dence of aerosol yields and product identiﬁcation are
needed since these compounds seem to have a large
SOA froming potential.
– Appropriately designed chamber experiments have to
be performed to develop and validate chemical refer-
ence schemes for aerosol for subsequent simpliﬁcation
based on understanding of chemical processes.
– The importance of multiphase chemistry in SOA forma-
tion has to be determined.
– Better measuring techniques are needed for carbona-
ceous aerosols especially with regard to the understand-
ing of the chemical composition and the ageing pro-
cesses of OA. Particular attention is needed to avoid
artifacts in sampling and analysis of OA compounds.
Since the distinction between black and organic carbon
is not clear, observations have to be accompanied by the
deﬁnition of the measured quantity. Effort has to be put
into avoiding inconsistencies between measurements of
carbonaceous aerosols.
– Homogeneisation of observations of carbonaceous
aerosols is needed that should also be applied to the
emission factors that are adopted for the construction
of chemical speciated emission inventories. This will
allow a better comparison of model results with mea-
surements.
– The synergistic use of ground based, aircraft and remote
sensing observations will allow optimal evaluation of
global model capabilities in simulating global organic
aerosol distributions.
– The effect of enhanced absorption by BC on cloud prop-
erties when BC is coated by organics has to be consid-
ered both in the direct and in the semi-direct forcing
calculations.
– Feedback-climate mechanisms involving organics have
to be investigated since SOA from biogenic volatile or-
ganics is estimated to be the major contributor to the
SOA mass.
Thus signiﬁcant biosphere-climate feed-
backs are expected to be involved with SOA existence
in the atmosphere.
Appendix A: Theory of hygroscopic growth of particles
and of cloud formation
The interaction of inorganic species with supersaturated wa-
ter vapour is appropriately described by traditional K¨ohler
theory (K¨ohler, 1936), in which thermodynamic arguments
provide the water vapour supersaturation needed to form a
droplet, as a function of its dry radius and chemical compo-
sition. The equilibrium condition is equality of the chemical
potential of water between the aqueous phase and the vapour
phase adjacent to the droplet surface. This relation is typ-
ically expressed in terms of the equilibrium ambient water
saturation ratio Seq (water vapour pressure over equilibrium
vapour pressure) and the droplet diameter, Dp:

where σ is the droplet solution surface tension, ρw is the
density of water, R is the universal gas constant, T is tem-
perature, Mw is the molecular weight of water, ν is the total
number of ions produced by dissociation of one molecule
of solute, 8 is the practical osmotic coefﬁcient of the so-
lution, and m is the solution molality. The product ν8 is
also known as the “effective van’t Hoff factor”. An approx-
imation frequently made is that the solution is dilute (8=1),
although this assumption does introduce some error (Brech-
tel and Kreidenweis, 2000). This error primarily affects the
larger nuclei, since their molalities are higher at activation
than smaller nuclei, but often does not signiﬁcantly affect
the number of CCN.
The droplet curvature (ﬁrst term in Eq. A1) tends to in-
crease the water vapour pressure, while the presence of so-
lute (second term in Eq. A1) acts to lower it. Expressing
Seq as a function of droplet diameter for a given initial par-
ticle, one obtains an equilibrium (or “K¨ohler”) curve that in-
creases steeply when Seq<1 and goes through a maximum
at some Seq above unity, the critical supersaturation, Sc. If
the ambient S exceeds Sc, there is always a gradient of wa-
ter vapour causing water to diffuse to and condense on the
droplet, resulting in unconstrained growth. When this hap-
pens, the droplet is said to be “activated”; atmospheric cloud
formation takes place when S starts crossing the critical su-
persaturation of particles in the air.
Inside a cloud, the driving force for the increase of S is
cooling caused usually by expansion of rising air, mixing or
radiation. Condensational depletion of water vapour and re-
lease of latent heat of condensation slow down the increase of
S, and at some point, S reaches a maximum. In principle, all
droplets with critical supersaturations below the maximum
value of S achieved can activate to cloud droplets, although
the diffusional growth of droplets may be sufﬁciently slow
that all droplets with critical supersaturations below the max-
imum S will not have time to activate (Nenes et al., 2001).
The maximum value of S achieved in rising air, as well as the
number of activated droplets results from a competition be-
tween the ambient cooling rate and condensational depletion
of water vapour from the growing CCN. Thus, anything that
can affect the growth rate of droplets would potentially af-
fect cloud droplet number. Droplet growth can be expressed
as (Seinfeld and Pandis, 1998):

where po is the saturation vapour pressure of water, 1Hv is
the heat of vaporization of water, D′
v is the mass transfer co-
efﬁcient of water vapour to the droplet, and, k′
a is the heat
conductivity of air, modiﬁed for non-continuum effects (Se-
infeld and Pandis, 1998).
Based on Eq. (A2), the maximum value of S is affected by
the number concentration, size distribution, and composition
of the aerosol particles present. Compositional effects are
not only expressed in Seq (Eq. A1); they can also affect D′
v.
This is because the size of CCN is comparable to the mean
free path of air molecules; thus, the probability, α, of a water
vapour molecule “sticking” upon the growing droplet will
inﬂuence D′
v, (Seinfeld and Pandis, 1998):

where Dv is the diffusivity of water vapour in air. α, also
known as “mass accommodation coefﬁcient”, is affected
by the chemical nature of the droplet-gas interface.
The
presence of surfactants may lower the value of α from the
commonly accepted value of ∼0.045 (Pruppacher and Klett,
1980) and affect the microphysical evolution of clouds (e.g.,
Feingold and Chuang, 2002; Nenes et al., 2002a).
