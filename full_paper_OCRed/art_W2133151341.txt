This paper describes the contents of the 2016 edition of the HITRAN molecular spectroscopic compila-
tion. The new edition replaces the previous HITRAN edition of 2012 and its updates during the inter-
vening years. The HITRAN molecular absorption compilation is composed of ﬁve major components: the
traditional line-by-line spectroscopic parameters required for high-resolution radiative-transfer codes,
infrared absorption cross-sections for molecules not yet amenable to representation in a line-by-line
form, collision-induced absorption data, aerosol indices of refraction, and general tables such as partition
sums that apply globally to the data. The new HITRAN is greatly extended in terms of accuracy, spectral
coverage, additional absorption phenomena, added line-shape formalisms, and validity. Moreover, mo-
lecules, isotopologues, and perturbing gases have been added that address the issues of atmospheres
beyond the Earth. Of considerable note, experimental IR cross-sections for almost 300 additional mo-
lecules important in different areas of atmospheric science have been added to the database. The
compilation can be accessed through www.hitran.org. Most of the HITRAN data have now been cast into
an underlying relational database structure that offers many advantages over the long-standing se-
quential text-based structure. The new structure empowers the user in many ways. It enables the in-
corporation of an extended set of fundamental parameters per transition, sophisticated line-shape
formalisms, easy user-deﬁned output formats, and very convenient searching, ﬁltering, and plotting of
data. A powerful application programming interface making use of structured query language (SQL)
features for higher-level applications of HITRAN is also provided.

1. Introduction
This article describes the data and software that have been
added, modiﬁed, or enhanced in the HITRAN (High Resolution
Transmission) compilation since the previous edition of 2012 [1]
(hereafter called HITRAN2012 in the text). The line-by-line portion
and the absorption cross-sections of the new edition, hereafter
called HITRAN2016, have now been cast into an underlying rela-
tional database structure as opposed to the long-standing ﬁxed-
length ASCII record format. A user-friendly powerful internet tool,
HITRANonline (accessible through www.hitran.org), is provided to
the user to query, ﬁlter, and plot sections of the data and to re-
trieve outputs in a host of convenient formats (see Hill et al. [2]).
The HITRAN compilation is composed of several components
that include (1) line-by-line spectroscopic parameters for high
resolution molecular absorption and radiance calculations (from
the microwave through the ultraviolet region of the spectrum); (2)
infrared absorption cross-sections (generally representing ab-
sorption by molecules that have very dense spectra or many low-
lying vibrational modes); (3) collision-induced absorption data-
sets; (4) tables of aerosol refractive indices; and (5) global data
that apply in a general manner to the archive. The updates to these
ﬁve portions of HITRAN as well as the new underlying system of
data structure with accompanying internet user interface will be
discussed in the following sections.
The new edition of the HITRAN database substantially increases
the database's potential to accurately model radiative processes in
the atmosphere of the Earth and other planets. Apart from im-
proving the accuracy of the existing parameters, more parameters
have been introduced, and new bands and isotopologues added.
Two gases (C2N2 and COCl2) are introduced to the database for the
ﬁrst time. Finally, a very dramatic expansion of the cross-sectional
part of the database is featured in this new edition.
It is necessary to call attention to some speciﬁcs of the HITRAN
database. The units used throughout HITRAN editions including
this one do not strictly adhere to the SI system for both historical
and application-speciﬁc reasons. Thus cm1 (reciprocal cen-
timeter) is seen throughout, as is atm (atmosphere) for pressure
(in SI units of Pascals, 101,325 Pa ¼ 1 atm). Also, the symbol ν is
used throughout for line position in cm1, thereby dropping the
tilde ( ν˜) that is the ofﬁcial designation of wavenumber. The HI-
TRAN unit
for
intensity
is
traditionally expressed
as
cm-1/
(molecule cm-2) rather than simplifying to the equivalent cm
molecule-1.
1.1. Overview of parameters (including new ones)
The traditional and probably most applied portion of HITRAN is
the line list of high-resolution spectral parameters. These line-by-
line parameters reﬂect values of individual transitions between
energy levels of rovibronic states that are required by high-re-
solution radiative-transfer codes. These parameters are shown in
Tables 1 and 2. Table 1 gives an overview of parameters that are
traditionally provided in the “.par” format as per HITRAN2004 [3]
formalism as well as broadening and shift parameters due to the
pressure of H2, He and CO2 (see Wilzewski et al. [4], Hill et al. [2]
and Kochanov et al. [5] for details). Table 2 provides information
on the parameters required for non-Voigt line-shape representa-
tions (see Wcisło et al. [6], Hill et al. [2] and Kochanov et al. [5] for
details). Ideally, they would arise from theoretically-consistent
calculations; however, since the emphasis in HITRAN is to provide
the user with the most accurate values available, they are often the
values obtained from controlled laboratory measurements when
quantum-mechanical calculations are not yet of comparable ac-
curacy. Nevertheless, theoretical calculations and semi-empirical
formulae are widely used in HITRAN to both interpolate and ex-
trapolate needed parameters for transitions missing from the
limited observed set.
Section 2 presents a description of changes made to the line-
by-line portion of HITRAN. It is organized in the order of the
molecules in HITRAN (a sequential number related to the entry of
the molecule into HITRAN). The discussions in the molecular sub-
sections give an overview of the addition of new bands, replace-
ment of line positions and/or intensities, and new or modiﬁed
line-shape parameters where applicable. There are also citations to
more detailed studies of the modiﬁcations.
With the recent advances in both laboratory spectrometers and
the power of theoretical treatments such as ab initio calculations,
the accuracy and the access to weak, yet important, transitions
have had a big impact on this edition of HITRAN.
Table 3 provides an overview of changes and additions to the
database with respect to the HITRAN2012 edition.
The line-by-line parameters (as well as the portion of HITRAN
devoted to cross-sections) have now been cast into a relational

database structure, described in Section 6.1. This underlying
structure has many advantages that were not available in the
previous ﬁxed-length format of previous HITRAN editions. The
database is now able to add many more parameters (becoming
necessary not only for planetary atmosphere applications, but also
to satisfy sophisticated remote-sensing requirements), is not lim-
ited to constraints of ﬁeld length, and can accommodate functional
forms for parameters. It also allows for a much more robust way
for the managers to check for errors, whether they be by tran-
scription, violated selection rules, incorrect quantum assignments,
etc.
1.2. New line-shape representations
Shapes of individual transitions in molecular spectra at atmo-
spheric conditions are mainly determined by collisions and the
Doppler effect. In the simplest case these two effects can be han-
dled with the Voigt proﬁle, where the collisions are described just
as a single-parameter exponential relaxation. In the previous
editions of HITRAN, the line shapes, with a very few exceptions,
were represented with the Voigt proﬁle. It turns out, however, that
this model is too simple to reproduce atmospheric spectra with
accuracy at the sub-percent level (see for instance Refs. [9,10]). For
some light molecules, in particular for molecular hydrogen (im-
portant for research on dense atmospheres of gas giants), the non-
Voigt effects are much more pronounced [6]. At this point the
database provides Voigt (for every transition), and speed-depen-
dent Voigt, Galatry [11] and Hartmann-Tran [7,8] proﬁles para-
meters where they had been measured and validated.
Ab initio line-shape models, originating from ﬁrst principles,
are far too complex to be simply implemented in a line-by-line
spectroscopic database. Therefore, a compromise between sim-
plicity of the model and the ﬁdelity of experimental spectra re-
presentation had to be found. In recent decades, a number of
phenomenological models that take into account both speed-de-
pendent effects and velocity-changing collisions had been ad-
vanced. Recently, Tran et al. developed a computationally efﬁcient
algorithm [7,8] for calculating one of them, the partially-correlated

speed-dependent hard-collision proﬁle [12] with quadratic speed
dependence [9]. An IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Ap-
plied Chemistry) task group recommended the use of this proﬁle
for high-resolution spectra representation [13] and call it the
Hartmann-Tran (HT) proﬁle. Ngo et al. [14] demonstrated that the
HT proﬁle well reconstructs the line shapes of the most important
atmospheric molecules. Therefore, the HT proﬁle has been adop-
ted as the default beyond-Voigt proﬁle in HITRAN. For measure-
ments with sufﬁciently high accuracy, we encourage spectro-
scopists to report not only the basic Voigt-proﬁle parameters, but
also the HT parameters. The details about the HT parametrization
adopted in HITRAN are given in Wcisło et al. [6]. Apart from new
parameters introduced to represent this proﬁle, one should note
that these parameters are also provided at four different tem-
perature ranges: 0–100 K, 100–200 K, 200–400 K and T> 400 K. The
reference parameters are given at the following reference tem-
peratures: 50 K, 150 K, 296 K and 700 K respectively.
It should be noted that even if the parameters of some more
advanced model (preferably HT) are now provided in HITRAN for a
growing number of transitions, the Voigt-proﬁle parameters are
still given for every transition in HITRAN. Therefore, for users not
interested in making use of sophisticated line shapes, the present
version of HITRAN remains compatible with the previous ones.
2. LIne-by-line modiﬁcations
2.1. H2O (molecule 1)
The HITRAN2016 edition has undergone a substantial revision
and expansion of the database of water vapor.
In HITRAN2012 [1] a very large expansion of the dynamic range
of the line intensities for non-deuterated isotopologues of water
vapor was implemented, thanks to the ab initio calculations from
the BT2 line list [15] and, in selected spectral intervals, Lodi et al.
[16] for the principal isotopologue and from Lodi and Tennyson for
H2
18O and H2
17O [17]. The ab initio results were replaced with
high-quality experimental or-semi-empirical data wherever pos-
sible. In HITRAN2016, we have done a similar expansion of the
dynamic
(and
spectral)
range
of
the
singly-deuterated
iso-
topologues. In addition, the D2
16O isotopologue makes its debut in
the database. D2O has a very low natural abundance on Earth but
is measurable in the atmospheres of other planets, notably Venus
which has an enhanced deuterium content [18] raising the im-
portance of D2O. Also, for ﬁtting
D-enriched HDO laboratory
spectra, a good D2O line list is essential. For this reason, D2O
transitions have been included using a lower intensity cutoff of
1032 cm1/(molecule  cm2) once isotopic abundance is ac-
counted for.
A dedicated paper detailing the update of the water-vapor
dataset in HITRAN2016 along with atmospheric and laboratory
validations is planned. Here we summarize only the most im-
portant details.
2.1.1. Line positions and intensities
This update is informed by the work of an International Union
of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) task group which produced
systematic sets of empirical energy levels (and hence transition
frequencies) for all the stable isotopologues of water [19–22]. In
HITRAN2012
non-deuterated
isotopologues
already
beneﬁted
from the availability of the IUPAC dataset of empirically-derived
energy levels (and transition wavenumbers derived from them),
and we extend this to the deuterated species here. However, some
important caveats of that compilation have to be noted.
a) The accuracy of some of the transitions generated from the
IUPAC set may be inferior to individual high-accuracy experi-
ments. Therefore, just like in HITRAN2012, we have given

preference to the experimental line position data from pre-
vious HITRAN editions if the uncertainty code was 5 (0.00001–
0.0001 cm1) or higher. Comparisons with atmospheric
spectra have shown that this was a correct choice.
b) The datasets constructed in Refs. [19–22] do not include
experimental data from the papers published after them.
Quite a few new levels have become available over the years
and some reassignments were in order (see for instance
Mikhailenko et al. [23] and Liu et al. [24]). We partially
updated the IUPAC datasets here. In particular, for the HD17O
and HD18O species, levels from Kyuberis et al. [25] were used.
For H2
18O and H2
17O, and to a lesser extent for H2
16O, levels
from Mikhailenko et al. [23, 26] and Liu et al. [24] were used.
Unfortunately, the IUPAC and Mikhailenko et al. quantum
assignments often differ and complete matching would re-
quire a substantial amount of time in the future. An update of
the IUPAC energy levels is in progress which will endeavor to
resolve these assignment issues.
Many of the updated water vapor lines use line positions
generated from the IUPAC energy levels and theoretical transition
intensities, based on a high-accuracy ab initio dipole moment
surface [16]. The methodology developed by Lodi and Tennyson
[17] involves using several calculated line lists to identify reliable

theoretical predictions. Lodi and Tennyson's intensity data were
used in their entirety for H2
17O and H2
18O in HITRAN2012. Sub-
sequent measurements and analysis by Regalia et al. [27,28] gave
good agreement with these intensities. The present update relies
heavily on Lodi-Tennyson style calculations for all isotopologues,
supplemented with high-quality experimental data where avail-
able. This approach has proven to work well in application to at-
mospheric and laboratory spectra (see for instance Campargue
et al. [29] and Ponomarev et al. [30]).
Given the reliance on these theoretical intensities, it is im-
portant to understand the systematic errors which ab initio cal-
culations may show. In the same issue of this journal, Birk et al.
[31] give an extensive intercomparison of ab initio calculations
with high-quality experimental data. The experimental intensities
used in the intercomparison are all included in the HITRAN2016
update. Much of the data show agreement between ab initio and
experiment within 2%. However, for some bands, notably those
involving excitation of the stretching modes, there are larger off-
sets of up to 8% which can be attributed to systematic errors in the
ab initio dipole moment calculations. Furthermore, in the ν1 fun-
damental, differences show a systematic dependence on wave-
number, ΔKa and ΔJ. Other vibrational bands involving the chan-
ges in ν1 quanta also showed larger systematic errors. The theo-
retical calculations also have problems in predicting local re-
sonances accurately, although these resonances start to appear
more frequently in the NIR part of the spectrum. The information
on systematic differences between the ab initio theory and ex-
periment for H2
16O can be used to estimate uncertainties for
minor isotopologues for which no high-accuracy experimental
intensities are available.
An important ﬁnding of this work is that for an individual vi-
brational band an intensity-independent offset appears in gra-
phical representations of differences between experiment and
theory vs. intensity. This information can be used to validate ex-
periment as well as theory. The constant offset can also be used to
predict weak line intensities where experimental data are un-
available by scaling ab initio values.

involving changes in the ν1 quanta, (100)-(000) and (110)-(010),
however, show large scatter and an offset around 2%. The scatter
includes the systematic differences of þ 5% to 13%, which be-
comes obvious when plotting the differences against wavenumber
or lower-state energy and color coding ΔKa and/or ΔJ [31].

and HD17O, as well as the newly-added isotopologue D2

use of variational calculations to provide the underlying line lists
guarantees the completeness of the lists for the intensity cutoff
employed. This completeness leads to a signiﬁcant expansion of
the number of important transitions of the deuterated iso-
topologues into the NIR (near-infrared) region. These line lists are
presented and analyzed in articles published in this issue [25].

beneﬁts from inclusion of HDO lines in the NIR. It is also important
to note a signiﬁcant increase in coverage for HD17O and HD18O
which were poorly represented in previous HITRAN releases.
The variational (calculated) intensities described above were
then replaced with intensities from available high-quality experi-
ments, many of which were already in the HITRAN2012 database.

intensity data are described below.
2.1.1.1. DLR experiments. An extensive work in the spectral ranges
1850–2280 cm1 and 2390–4000 cm1 was carried out by Loos
et al. [33,34] and in the range 4190–4340 cm1 by Birk et al. [31].
In Fig. 3 we will refer to these, and the experiments from the same
authors that are already in HITRAN, as DLR. In Loos et al. [33,34]
line positions, intensities, self- and air-broadened line-shape
parameters, their temperature dependence as well as Rosenkranz
line coupling coefﬁcients were retrieved from numerous Fourier-
Transform transmittance measurements of self- and air-broadened
water vapor at 296 K as well as air-broadened water vapor mea-
surements at low and high temperatures. During the analysis, a
large effort was undertaken to give consolidated error bars. In the
analysis, a multispectrum ﬁtting approach applying a quadratic
speed-dependent hard collision model based on the Hartmann-
Tran proﬁle [7,8] and extended to account for line mixing in the
Rosenkranz ﬁrst order perturbation approximation [35] was used.
Line
positions,
intensities
and
self-broadening,
self-speed-
dependence and self-shift parameters, as well as in some cases
self-line coupling coefﬁcients, were retrieved from pure water-
vapor measurements of total pressures up to 20 mbar. Air-broad-
ening, speed-dependence, pressure shift parameters, Dicke nar-
rowing and line-mixing coefﬁcients as well as temperature-de-
pendence parameters were obtained from air-broadened mea-
surements at ambient temperature and total pressures from 30 to
1000 mbar as well as low and high-temperature measurements at
100 mbar total pressure. The intensities of lines with retrieved line
parameters range from 3  1026 to 3  1019 cm-1/(molecule
cm-2). In the 4190–4340 cm1 region, several Fourier-Transform
transmittance spectra of pure and air-broadened water vapor at
296 K as well as low and high temperatures were measured and
analyzed by Birk et al. [31]. These measurements were dedicated
to water vapor parameters to be used in TROPOMI/S5-P [36] re-
trievals. The analysis was also based on a multispectrum ﬁt using
the HT proﬁle. Line positions, intensities, self- and air-broadened

were retrieved in the analysis.
2.1.1.2. MiKaMo16 experimental set. Recently, Mikhailenko et al.
[23] have compiled a database of measurements in 5850–
8340 cm1 region from the Grenoble-Tomsk collaboration re-
ported in Refs. [37–41] supplemented with measurements from
Sironneau and Hodges [42] and for strong lines from Toth [43] and
for very weak lines from ab initio work of Partridge and Schwenke
[44,45]. This database is here referred to as MiKaMo16. Un-
fortunately, due to some differences in assignments with the
variational Lodi-Tennyson-like line lists described above, it was
hard to take full advantage of this line list. However, tests against
TCCON spectra have shown that this line list is superior to any
other line list in the region of 7000–8340 cm1. It was therefore
used in HITRAN2016 in that region as is almost everywhere in this
spectral region. This, however, creates some consistency issues
with assignments of energy levels throughout the database, but
substantial improvement of atmospheric retrievals justiﬁes this
approach.
As examples of the complexity of the update, Figs. 3 and 4 show
the ﬂow diagrams of the construction of position-intensity line
lists of the principal isotopologue (only up to 8340 cm1 for
simplicity) and for H2
18O/H2
17O respectively. Note that the line list
from Lodi et al. [16] for the principal isotopologue is limited to
1028 cm1/(molecule cm2); therefore intensities for weaker
lines still originate from HITRAN2012/BT2.
Whenever a rotational quantum number could not be de-
termined unambiguously, the index of symmetry (1, 2, 3, and 4 as
deﬁned in the BT2 work [15]) accompanied with a negative sign
was used. Note that 1 and 2 indicate para states, whereas 3 and
4 indicate ortho states. For the case of unassigned vibrational
quanta, a “-2” label has been adopted.
2.1.2. Line-shape parameters for the H2
16O, H2
18O and H2
17O line lists
The air-broadened half widths (in Voigt proﬁle formalism) for
the ﬁrst three isotopologues of water in HITRAN2008 and, with
some modiﬁcations, in HITRAN2012 were derived using the pro-
cedure “Diet” described by Gordon et al. [46]. This procedure
continues to be used in this edition with experimental outliers
identiﬁed and removed. One notable example is the removal of a
large portion of the half widths measured in Jenouvrier et al. [47]
from the experimental data that feeds the “Diet”. Indeed, some of
the recent evaluations of atmospheric spectra showed that many
data in Jenovrier et al. are questionable (see for instance Armante
et al. [48]). However, although the removal of this extensive da-
taset from the updated Gordon et al. [46] procedure, as was done
in the GEISA database [49] and the MiKaMo16 linelist, have im-
proved the residuals in some of the lines, some of the residuals
became worse than in HITRAN2012. The main problem here is due
to the fact that, while there are deﬁnite outliers in the values re-
ported in Jenouvrier et al. [47], it is the most extensive study of the
air-broadened line widths in the 4200–6600 cm1 region. In fact,
for many transitions no other measurements exist. Removal of
these measurements from the experimental dataset has invoked
the use of the approximations of different levels (some are very
crude) from the work of Jacquemart et al. [50] for many of the
transitions. The only solution in this case was to ﬁlter the Je-
nouvrier et al. dataset. This was done through direct comparisons
with the TCCON spectra for some of the transitions and cross-
comparison with similar rotational transitions but from other
bands, accounting for vibrational dependence from Eq. (1) of Jac-
quemart et al. [50]. After this ﬁltering procedure, about 1400
measurements (out of almost 5000) from Jenouvrier et al. [47]
were retained.
It is also important to emphasize that measurements by Birk
and Wagner [51] in the ν2 band region were given a priority and
were
written
into
the
database
directly
as
was
done
in
HITRAN2012.
Since the modeling of water vapor absorption lines using a
Voigt model is no longer sufﬁcient in many applications and the
HT proﬁle provides considerably higher accuracy, experimental HT
proﬁle parameters of Birk et al. and Loos et al. [31,33,34] in the
spectral ranges 1850–2280 cm1, 2390–4000 cm1 and 4190–
4340 cm1 were accommodated wherever possible. The experi-
ments and analysis procedures applied are described brieﬂy in
Section 2.1.1.
2.1.3. Line-shape parameters for the deuterated isotopologues
The addition of the line-shape parameters for D2O follows a
similar procedure as the other isotopologues; however, the avail-
able data for air-broadening of D2O are considerably less complete
than for the other isotopologues. There are some measurements
for air-broadening of D2O [52–55] as well as Complex Robert-Bo-
namy calculations [56]. These data amount to several hundred
lines from the measured data and just over 550 lines from the
theoretical calculations. Using these data, average values as a
function of J″ were determined and extrapolation to J″¼ 50 was
done using a third-order polynomial ﬁt.
Using these data, the half widths and some line shifts have
been added to the D2O lines in the database using a priority
scheme. First, the measured values were added; if the measure-
ment did not exist for the transition in question, the theoretical
value was used. If neither exists, the J-averaged value was used.
This algorithm allowed half widths to be added to all D2O lines in
the HITRAN database.
For self-broadening parameters of D2O, the work of Gamache
et al. [57] was used. These data are an extensive set of calculations
for D2O rotational band transitions extended to 6536 lines using
the partner transition rule [58]. Using these data, a set of J-aver-
aged half widths was determined for J ¼ 0–50 [57]. These data
have been added to the algorithm that adds line-shape data to the
water lines in the HITRAN database.
2.1.4. Future plans
Recently, Lampel et al. [59] have identiﬁed important absorp-
tion features in atmospheric spectra due to water vibration-rota-
tion transitions in the near ultraviolet around 363 nm. Laboratory
measurements of water vibration-rotation transition intensities
only extend to 25,470 cm1 (393 nm) [60] although multiphoton
spectra do provide some information on energy levels in the re-
gion of question [61,62]. Future updates will look to extend cov-
erage to water absorption in the near ultraviolet; these data are
important for upcoming satellite missions, including TEMPO [63]
which will record spectra at these wavelengths.
At the intensity limit assumed for D2
16O, the even rarer iso-
topologues D2
17O and D2
18O should also be visible. Line lists for
these two species have also been prepared as part of the work on
deuterated water in Ref. [25]; these data will be added in the
forthcoming updates to HITRAN2016.
We will be populating the database of the HT line-shape
parameters after evaluating existing literature values and new
measurements as they become available.
2.2. CO2 (molecule 2)
Accurate and comprehensive line lists for all naturally abun-
dant isotopologues of carbon dioxide are required by remote-
sensing missions dedicated to monitor the concentration of carbon
dioxide in Earth's atmosphere. The recently launched OCO-2
mission [64–66], together with several other space and ground
based projects (GOSAT [67], AIRS [68], ASCENDS [69], TCCON [32],
NDACC [70]) are dedicated to explicitly monitor the atmospheric

----- Page 12 (native text) -----
CO2 content. These experiments aim not only to look at overall CO2
concentration and its variation, but also wish to pinpoint where
CO2 is being produced (sources) and where it is absorbed (sinks).
This activity is clearly vital to monitoring and essential for even-
tually controlling the CO2 content of the atmosphere [71]. A suc-
cessful retrieval of CO2 concentration requires validated line lists
with transition intensities given at sub-percent accuracy, line po-
sitions accurate to 0.0001 cm1 or better, and beyond-Voigt-pro-
ﬁle line-shape models [65,72,73].
Determination of isotopic ratios of carbon in Earth's samples
and astrophysical objects remains crucial for modeling geophysical
processes. For example, quantiﬁcation of 14C in fossil fuels can
provide information about the sources of human-related con-
tribution to the total CO2 concentration in the terrestrial atmo-
sphere. This can be done with recently developed cavity-enhanced
laser spectroscopic techniques in the IR [74–76]. However, these
measurements require a priori simultaneous knowledge of reliable
line intensities of many isotopologues. Precise determination of
13C/12C and 16O/17O/18O ratios is also vital, for instance, in under-
standing processes of formation of radiation ﬁelds in the Martian
atmosphere, which is 96% rich in carbon dioxide [77].
A summary of the carbon dioxide line list in the HITRAN2012
database and comparison to HITRAN2016 is given in Table 4. The
HITRAN2012 database was considerably improved with respect to
its previous 2008 edition. However, several issues related to
spectral completeness, inconsistency of multiple data sources, and
insufﬁcient accuracy of line intensities, still remained unsolved.
The majority of entries in the 2012 version of the HITRAN database
were taken from the effective Hamiltonian calculations included in
the 2008 edition of the CDSD-296 database [78].
For less abundant isotopologues, obtaining high-quality ex-
perimental data is not trivial. Therefore ﬁts of the effective Ha-
miltonian or the effective dipole moment [78], were based on only
four

isotopologues

16O12C17O, for which measured spectroscopic parameters were
available. As a result, several spectral gaps were present in HI-
TRAN2012 (see for instance discussion in Refs. [79,80]) which re-
present regions where experimental data were unavailable. For
similar reasons, no entries were included in the database for the
18O13C17O, 17O13C17O, and 16O14C16O isotopologues (837, 737, and
646 in old AFGL notation). An overview of this problem is dis-
played in Figs. 5 and 6, where CO2 ro-vibrational spectra from
HITRAN2012
and
HITRAN2016
are
compared
for
different
isotopologues.
Wherever possible, the effective Hamiltonian ﬁts were extra-
polated to the trace isotopologues, using a method of isotopic
substitution [81]. In the 2012 edition, multiple data sources caused
sporadic discontinuities in intensity patterns of ro-vibrational lines
[82–84]. Furthermore, a high percentage of line intensities in HI-
TRAN2012 have stated uncertainty of 20% or worse (HITRAN un-
certainty index equal to 3). Although this assessment has been
proven to be overly pessimistic in many cases [82,83,85–87], the
uncertainty budget, especially for the Effective Hamiltonian cal-
culations, was still too high for precise measurements of atmo-
spheric CO2 concentration. The most accurate entries in HI-
TRAN2012 were taken from NASA JPL measurements by Toth et al.
[88–90] and covered the 1.6-mm and 2.06-mm spectral regions,
which are used in remote-sensing measurements. The stated 1–5%
accuracy of these experimental line intensities (HITRAN un-
certainty index equal to 7 and 6), has been conﬁrmed by a number
of comparisons [82,83,91]; nonetheless the rigorous requirements
for part-per-million resolution in measurements of CO2 atmo-
spheric concentration were not achieved.
Since the 2012 release of the HITRAN database, a large number
of experimental and theoretical studies have been devoted to
improve the knowledge of line positions, line intensities and line
shapes of CO2 isotopologues. For a comprehensive review of
measurements and theoretical models see Ref [92]. and references
therein.
Theoretical line lists (denoted as "Ames") for 12 stable and one
radioactive (646) isotopologue of CO2 were published by Huang
et al. in the 0–20,000 cm1 spectral region and for temperatures
below 1500 K [79,93,94]. Room-temperature line lists (denoted as
"UCL-IAO") for 13 CO2 isotopologues were also calculated by Zak
et al. [82,83,85,91] in the 0–8000 cm1 spectral region. Both of
these latter studies contained intensities computed with ab initio
dipole moment surfaces and semi-empirical line positions, based
on a ﬁtted potential energy surface for the Ames effort and on the
effective Hamiltonian calculations for UCL-IAO. A major advantage
of the variational approach used in the Ames and UCL-IAO line lists
is that it should give similar accuracy for all isotopologues. This
allows coverage of spectral regions currently not probed by ex-
periments for rare isotopologues. UCL-IAO also provides un-
certainty estimates of line intensities, based on a purely theoretical
methodology [17]. Such a reliable analysis allows for the detection
of ro-vibrational resonance interactions, which signiﬁcantly lower
the accuracy of theoretical line positions and intensities. Using this
method, the lines identiﬁed as unreliable have been replaced with
the data from CDSD-296 [92] and, in several cases of interpolyad
resonance
interactions
(asymmetric
isotopologues),
with
the

experimental data from Lyulin et al. [95], Karlovets et al. [96,97]
and Campargue et al. [98].
Recently, there have been a number of high-precision near-IR
spectroscopic measurements which provide rigorous tests of the-
oretical line intensities based on effective dipole moment surface
and ab initio calculations [84–87,99]. Particularly, in the 1.6-mm
and 2.0-mm spectral regions, the UCL-IAO line lists have been ex-
perimentally veriﬁed as accurate to the sub-percent level. Fig. 7
compares the UCL-IAO and Ames line lists to HITRAN2012 (Toth
et al. blue open circles [100, 101]) for the 20012 00001 band and
to state-of-the-art experiments including advanced high-resolu-
tion laser measurements [101–104]. A number of comparisons
here suggest that the UCL-IAO study models line intensities more
accurately than the Ames study. Note that more recent results
from Ames, which are available from their website (www.huang.
seti.org), give closer agreement with UCL-IAO. From Fig. 7 it is
clear that there is a 1–3% average difference in line intensities
between the new and the previous version of HITRAN for this
band. The independent experiments from the National Institute of
Standards and Technology [104], and the University of Naples II
[103] conﬁrm, however, a conservative 0.5% accuracy of line in-
tensities for this band in HITRAN2016. This level of accuracy could
potentially satisfy even the most stringent requirements of current
remote-sensing missions. Interestingly, although line intensities
for this band and the 20013  00001 and 30013 – 00001 bands
probed by OCO-2 originate from the same source (Toth et al.
[100]), the agreement between UCL-IAO and HITRAN2012 is sub-
stantially better for the OCO-2 bands.
For wavenumbers greater than 8000 cm1, the majority of the
line parameters were taken from CDSD-296 [92]. As we have al-
ready mentioned above, both HITRAN2012 and CDSD-296 have
several spectral gaps, in particular in the wavenumber region
greater than 8000 cm1. Recently, several experimental studies of
the carbon dioxide spectra in the high-frequency region have been
performed [105–108]. The measured line intensities allowed de-
termining the absent effective dipole moment parameters for
several series of transitions. Using these effective dipole moment
parameters and an effective Hamiltonian from Ref. [109], the line
positions and intensities for the principal isotopologue were
generated and included into HITRAN2016 covering the 9800–
10,500 cm1 and 11,600–12,400 cm1 wavenumber gaps.
Line positions were updated with respect to the previous ver-
sion of the database. The majority of lines come from the effective
Hamiltonian calculations included in UCL-IAO line lists, which are
based on the ﬁts to the observed line positions collected from the
literature and published in the latest, 2015 release of the CDSD-
296 database [92]. These ﬁts were completed and updated with
recent, accurate measurements performed on isotopically-en-
riched samples of CO2. Uncertainties in the ﬁtted line positions
depend on the quality of the experimental data and vary from
0.001 cm1 to 109 cm1. For asymmetric isotopologues, a
number of bands are affected by strong interpolyad anharmonic
resonance interactions. The effective Hamiltonian model does not
include this type of interaction for the asymmetric isotopologues.
Hence in such cases, line positions were taken directly from
measurements [80,95–98,110,111].
The uncertainty codes for the line positions were transferred
from CDSD-296 to HITRAN2016. The uncertainty code 3 (0.001–
0.01 cm1) was given for the line positions in the 9800–
10,500 cm1 and 11,600–12,400 cm1 wavenumber regions. Par-
tition functions in the current release of the database are based on
the direct summations taken from the variational calculations of
Huang et al. [79]. On average, the new partition functions agree
excellently with those of CDSD-296 [83]; however they do not
agree perfectly with those in HITRAN2012 (from TIPS [112]) and
three previous editions of the database and differ at 296 K by
about 0.3%. Although this difference is marginal, it could have an
effect in the applications where sub-percent accuracy is required.
As stated above, the radioactive isotopologue 14CO2, 646, has
been added to the database. This is the ﬁrst edition of HITRAN
where radioactive species have been incorporated (also for CO, see
Section 2.5). All lines of the 646 isotopologue were taken from the
UCL line lists given in Ref. [83]. Due to issues with what constitutes
a so-called natural terrestrial abundance of radioactive species
(which is part of the traditional deﬁnition of intensities in HITRAN,
see Eq. (1) of the Deﬁnitions and Units documentation in HI-
TRANonline), line intensities for these type of species are given for
unit abundance; a 1027 cm1/(molecule  cm2) cut-off value for
the intensity has been applied. This cut-off produced 41,610 lines
in the J range 0 to 114. Vibrational assignments for the 646 iso-
topologue were based on isotopic shifts of energy levels and re-
spective assignments for the 626 and 636 isotopologues, and
hence should be regarded as provisional. An abundance-scaled
intensity cut-off of 1030 cm1/(molecule  cm2) is used for all
stable isotopologues. Note that, for the time being, data for the
radioactive isotopologues are provided as static ﬁles rather than
through the HITRANonline interface.
Uncertainties of line intensities were informed by theoretical
error analysis, which classiﬁed lines as reliable, intermediate, or
unreliable. Bands with reliable lines stronger than 1023 cm1/
(molecule  cm2) (for unit abundance) were assigned HITRAN
uncertainty code 8 (i.e. accuracy of 1% or better). Line intensities of
reliable parallel bands weaker than 1023 cm1/(molecule  cm2)
were given an uncertainty code 7 (i.e. accuracy 1-2%). Reliable
perpendicular bands weaker than 1023 cm1/(molecule  cm2)
and intermediate lines were marked with HITRAN uncertainty
code 6 (i.e. accuracy 2-5%). So-called unreliable lines were taken
from the effective dipole moment calculations [92] and experi-
ments. Typical intensity uncertainties for these entries range be-
tween 5 and 20%.
It is important to point out that an intensive study of the 1.6-
mm and 2.06-mm bands that includes non-Voigt lineshapes and
line mixing has been published by the OCO-2 spectroscopy sup-
port group ABSCO (ABSorption COefﬁcient tables for the OCO-2
mission) [84,86]. The data were ﬁt using a multi spectrum ﬁt
procedure which, among other things, enables retrieval of the line-
shape parameters using the speed-dependent Voigt (SDV) proﬁle
as well as line mixing. These are very good experiments and it is
debatable whether to use them for the strong and weak bands in
place of UCL-IAO parameters described above. Indeed the ABSCO
team have validated (using TCCON spectra) the cross-sections
generated using results of Refs. [84,86] and found them to be the
most efﬁcient [113]. However, achieving high-precision results in
nuanced correlations, with line mixing and model assumptions
that can create discontinuities in inter-band comparisons, is dif-
ﬁcult. At the moment, HITRAN cannot provide users with tools
that can be used to generate cross-sections from the works of Devi
et al. [84] and Benner et al. [86]. The usable products of the ABSCO
effort are absorption coefﬁcients (available upon request from the
ABSCO group) rather than spectral parameters, which are available
in the publications. Moreover, these absorption coefﬁcients are
empirically scaled by the factors of 0.6% and 1.4% for the 1.6-mm
and 2.06-mm bands respectively, due to lingering data and/or
model biases (the use of partition function HITRAN 2012/TIPS is up
to 0.3% of this factor). After these studies, an update of the multi
spectrum ﬁtting code with CDSD partition functions was done.
Additional methods to adjust the intensity distribution closer to
the UCL list by scaling experimental conditions within the un-
certainties are under evaluation. The intensities of the band at

the additional 0.7% scaling of ABSCO cross-sections may be un-
related to intensities. These issues will be considered for future

editions of the database.
For wavenumbers greater than 8000 cm1, two sources of the
line intensities are used: CDSD-296 [92] and the newly-generated
line list in the 9800–10,500 cm1 and 11,600–12,400 cm1 regions
based on the new measurements [105–108]. The uncertainty codes
of the CDSD-296 line intensities were transferred to HITRAN2016.
Based on the uncertainties of the line intensity measurements in
the 10,700–10,860 cm1 region [106], we use uncertainty code 5
(5%10%) for the line intensities of the 3003i-00001 (i¼ 1,2,3,4)
series of bands and based on the uncertainties of the line intensity
measurements
in
the
10,000–10,300
cm1
and
11,600–
12,400 cm1 [107] wavenumber regions we use uncertainty code
3 (> 20%) for the line intensities of the 4003i-00001 (i¼ 1,2,3,4,5)
and of the 6001i-00001 (i¼ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7) series of bands.
The Voigt line-shape parameters throughout the entire data-
base were calculated using the predictive routine of Gamache and
Lamouroux explained in Refs. [114–116]. For the line mixing, we
now provide a code from Lamouroux et al. [117] which has been
updated to operate with HITRAN2016. We note that Lamouroux
et al. [117] line mixing coupled with the HITRAN2012 data has
worked really well and in fact produced residuals hardly exceeding
1% when applied to the TCCON data in Ref. [113], although slightly
inferior to the ABSCO cross-sections in the 2.06-mm region.
2.3. O3 (molecule 3)
The spectroscopic database for ozone is important for atmo-
spheric and environmental applications due to its critical roles in
UV shielding, radiative transfer and health. It is also considered a
possible bio-marker for future observations of exoplanets [118]. In
order to understand the impacts of ozone on the atmosphere and
to monitor ozone a precise, knowledge of its line parameters at all
wavelengths is required.
The ozone parameters for this edition of HITRAN have been
updated in two steps. First, the parameters of spectroscopic
models, line positions, intensities, and lower-state energy levels
resulting from analyses of experimental spectra have been in-
troduced into the S&MPO (Spectroscopy and Molecular Properties
of Ozone) information system [119]. The S&MPO offers various
tools for spectral simulations and for comparisons with experi-
mental records. At the initial stage of the work, line lists were
generated using empirically-ﬁtted model parameters of the ef-
fective Hamiltonians (EH) which considered nearby strongly in-
teracting levels and of the corresponding effective dipole transi-
tion moments (ETM). This procedure was necessary to obtain
complete sets of transitions as only a limited number of unblended
lines could be accurately measured in congested ozone spectra.
State-of-the-art studies of ozone laboratory spectra in the infrared
have been recently reviewed by Barbe et al. [120] and Mikhailenko
[121]. Note that most of the compilations of ozone data in the
infrared accessible via the VAMDC (Virtual Atomic and Molecular
Data Center) portal [122,123] are also based on the S&MPO line
lists. This is the case of recent improvements in HITRAN and also in
GEISA [49] for which the last release essentially contained the
earlier 2015 update from the S&MPO.
In the second step, the line lists were validated by simulating
atmospheric spectra as discussed in Section 2.3.3.
The new or completely recalculated bands of the principal
isotopologue of ozone implemented in HITRAN2016 are summar-
ized in Table 5. The present release of the ozone data contains
29,006 new lines and 46,688 updated lines of 16O3 (a graphical
overview in the 200-5000 cm-1 region can be seen in Fig. 8).
2.3.1. Cold bands
2.3.1.1. 5-mm region: tetrad {(002),(101),(200),(030)} – (000). The 5-
mm range is of particular importance for the retrieval of atmospheric
ozone from ground-based and satellite observations, as this is the
second strongest absorbing range in the ozone spectrum after the 10-
mm bands. For this reason, the consistency of ozone intensities be-
tween the 5-mm and 10-mm regions as well as with UV ozone ab-
sorption is a major issue that has been a subject of many discussions
([124,125] and references therein). The line parameters in previous
HITRAN versions for the strongest bands, i.e. the ﬁrst triad ν1þν3, 2ν1,
2ν3, in the 5-mm interval were from the work by Flaud et al. [126].
Subsequently, the FTS spectra were re-visited by Barbe et al. [127]
though the corresponding data had not been included in HITRAN.
Recently new measurements and analyses have been performed by
the GSMA (Groupe de Spectrométrie Moléculaire et Atmosphérique)
team from Reims University [120,128]. In 2015, a major update of line
positions and intensities based on the list generated together with the
Laboratory of Theoretical Spectroscopy of the Institute of Atmospheric
Optics (Tomsk) was introduced in the S&MPO [119]. For the 2ν1 and

green, updated lines blue and unchanged HITRAN2012 lines grey (intensities are given in cm-1/molecule  cm-2 at 296 K).

2ν3 bands, the difference in the integrated intensities, SV, exceeded 6%
between S&MPO and HITRAN2012. The analysis [128] covering the
1856–2273 cm1 region also included the 3ν2 band, which is coupled
with ν1þν3 via an accidental Coriolis interaction. Another resonance
accounted for in this list explains the anomalously strong ΔKa ¼ 5
lines that have been detected in atmospheric observations by Gold-
man et al. [129]. Janssen et al. [125] reported a comparative study of
the sensitivity of FTIR ground-based measurements of the atmo-
spheric ozone concentration with respect to line parameters included
in the HITRAN2012, GEISA2015 and S&MPO databases in 10- and 5-
mm regions. They have concluded that “only S&MPO gives an entirely
consistent result at the 7 1% level”. Consequently, we include the
S&MPO line positions and intensities in the present HITRAN release.
This should improve both intensity distribution in the ro-vibrational
lines of the 5-mm bands and their consistency with the 10-mm range.
The line-shape parameters for all the lines were estimated using the
semi-empirical procedure described in the HITRAN2008 paper. This
model largely relies on a slightly revised empirical model for the
fundamental bands from Ref. [130].

bands
{(120),(021)}–(000). Another
spectral interval where S&MPO and HITRAN2012 ozone data differ
signiﬁcantly is for the 2ν2þν3, ν1 þ 2ν2 bands in the 2335-
2617 cm1 range. Previous HITRAN versions included the MIPAS
list [131] for 2ν2þν3 and older data from Flaud et al. [126] for
ν1 þ 2ν2. S&MPO data in this range were initially based on the
analyses of Barbe et al. [132]. Subsequently, new Reims FTS mea-
surements with a better signal-to-noise ratio [120] suggested an
empirical intensity scaling factor of 0.86 for these bands. The re-
sulting line list is provided for this release of HITRAN. Recently,
accurate ab initio dipole moment surfaces of ozone were con-
structed by Tyuterev et al. [133] that allowed theoretical in-
tensities to be obtained from variational nuclear-motion calcula-
tions which used the potential energy surface of Ref [134]. The
shape of the ν1 þ 2ν2 band given by these calculations is qualita-
tively more consistent with the S&MPO data incorporated in the

2.3.1.3. 3584–3831
cm1
range:
{(013),(112)}–(000)
bands. The
S&MPO contains data for the ν2 þ 3ν3 and ν1þν2 þ 2ν3 bands in the
range 3584–3831 cm1 based on a larger sample of assigned
transitions [135] than the previous releases of HITRAN (see Table 4
of Babikov et al. [119]). The parameters can be found in the cor-
responding sections of the online S&MPO site [119], and 5729
transitions are now included that makes the integrated intensity of
the ν1þν2 þ 2ν3 band nearly 5 times stronger (Table 5) than in the
previous release.
2.3.1.4. 4268–4399 cm1 range: {(023),(122),(400)}–(000) bands. In
the
range
4200–
4525
cm1,
only
the
3ν1þν3
[136]
and
2ν1 þ 2ν2þν3 [137] cold bands were included in the previous re-
leases of HITRAN, whereas the 2ν2 þ 3ν3, ν1 þ 2ν2 þ 2ν3 and 4ν1
bands in the 4268–4399 cm1 range were missing, although they
correspond to a total integrated intensity of 2.4  1022 cm1/
molecule cm2. The corresponding analyses [121,138] are as yet
unpublished, but the line parameters can be found at the online
S&MPO site [119] and are now incorporated in HITRAN2016.
2.3.1.5. 4802–4929 cm1 range: {(005),(311),(104)}– (000) bands.
Line parameters for the 5ν3, 3ν1þν2þν3 and ν1 þ 4ν3 bands around
4900 cm1 are calculated for the HITRAN database using the
spectroscopic parameters of Flaud et al. [139]. These bands were
then re-analyzed using new spectra recorded in Reims [120] re-
sulting in a new set of the Hamiltonian parameters for the strongly
coupled {(005),(104),(311)} vibration states. The corresponding
line lists have been generated using these improved spectroscopic
parameters. Unpublished Hamiltonian parameters can be found in
the S&MPO system at http://smpo.iao.ru/1408x675/en/lev/par/1/
19/. The (S&MPO–HITRAN2012) differences in the line positions
are up to 0.065 cm1. The intensity ratios for three cold bands are
shown in Fig. 10.
2.3.2. Hot bands
2.3.2.1. 281–447 cm1 (dyad -ν2). The ozone spectrum in the range
281–447 cm1 is dominated by hot ν3-ν2 and ν1-ν2 bands whose
intensities were underestimated in the previous HITRAN releases
compared to the S&MPO line list [120] which was generated using
the empirical transition moments parameters of Birk et al. [140].
The S&MPO parameters are conﬁrmed by the recent ab initio in-
tensity calculations [133] and the corresponding update is thus
included in the present HITRAN release.
2.3.2.2. 598–1541 cm1: hot bands towards the tetrad region. The
unpublished version of the newly determined tetrad {(002),(101),
(200),(030)} parameters by Tyuterev et al. [128] can be found at
the S&MPO online site (http://smpo.iao.ru/1396x659/en/lev/par/1/
6/). Using this set, 14 hot bands in the range 598–1541 cm1 that
go from the (010), (020), (001) and (100) states to the tetrad were
re-calculated and are now included in the present HITRAN release
with a signiﬁcantly augmented number of transitions. The transi-
tion moment parameters of Ref. [128] for {(101),(030)}–(010)
bands and those extrapolated from cold bands [141] were used.
2.3.2.3. 2889–3122 cm1 range: {(013),(112)}–(010) bands ; 3564–
3752 cm-1 range: {(023),(122)}–(010) bands. In the ranges 2889–
3122 cm1 and 3564–3752 cm1 the {(013),(112)}–(010) and
{(023),(122)}–(010) hot bands are updated using the same upper-
state EH parameters as for the corresponding cold bands and the
ETM parameters of Mikhailenko et al. [142]
2.3.2.4. 3623–4229 cm1: hot bands to the V¼ 5 triad {(005),(311),
(104)}. New line lists for 14 hot bands in the range 3623–
4229 cm1 corresponding to the transitions from the (010, (001)
and (100) states to the updated [120] triad {(005),(311),(104)} of
ﬁve vibrational quanta are also included.
2.3.2.5. 4384–4826 cm1: missing hot bands to (213),(321) and (114)
upper states. The coupled vibrational states {(213),(321),(114)}
have been re-analyzed in Ref [143] with the FTS spectra recorded
in Reims. Using these upper-state parameters we now provide four
associated hot bands [119] in the range 4384–4826 cm1 that
were missing in previous HITRAN versions. The ETM parameters
were
extrapolated
from
the
corresponding
cold
bands:
for
2ν2þν2 þ 3ν3-ν1
and
ν2þν2 þ 4ν3-ν3
from
Ref
[144],
for
2ν2þν2 þ 3ν3-ν2 from Ref [145], and for 3ν2 þ 2ν2þν3-ν1 from Ref
[137].
2.3.3. Validations and empirical corrections
As mentioned in the introduction to Section 2.3, the second
Fig. 9. Comparison of HITRAN2012 and HITRAN2016 ozone line lists in the range of
2ν2þν3 and ν1 þ 2ν2 bands with recent ab initio calculations using the dipole-

the rotational distribution of intensities in the ν1 þ 2ν2 band given by HITRAN2016.

step was a validation of effective model calculations by a com-
parison of simulated absorption cross-sections with observed
spectra. To this end, high-resolution laboratory FTS spectra of
Reims and Kitt-Peak (up to 5700 cm1) were used alongside MklV
balloon atmospheric spectra [146], using similar procedures to
those described by Toon et al. in [147]. The MkIV balloon spectra
cover 650–5650 cm1 simultaneously in every spectrum, so every
window is ﬁtted in every spectrum, making it easier to quantify
window-to-window biases.
No major problems were seen with the initial O3 data set
prepared for HITRAN2016, at least for strong and medium-
strength bands. The new line list provides improved spectral ﬁts in
the 2100 cm1 region as compared with HITRAN2012 and also
better consistency with other bands in terms of the retrieved O3
amounts in the 2000–2200 cm1 region. But it was found that
empirical corrections were needed to some line positions to re-
duce residuals between observed and simulated cross-sections.
These corrections concern a limited sample of about 0.1% transi-
tions and are essentially of two types. First, small line position
corrections are typically of the order of ∼103 cm1 up to
102 cm1 in a few cases. The most extreme deviations were
corrected already for HITRAN2016, but additional corrections will
be done in the near future. Note that these corrections are not
reﬂected in Table 5 where only updates for entire bands rather
than individual transitions were carried out. A total of 75,694 lines
for 16O3 have been added or updated (this includes corrections
from Table 5 and the empirical corrections discussed in this sub-
section). Note that there are 289,340 lines of the principal iso-
topologue of ozone in total in the HITRAN2016 edition. Secondly,
there is an indication that pressure-induced line shift parameters
may need to be added or extended in the future.
It is known [120] that for the fundamental bands the effective
model ﬁts reproduce observed spectra within experimental accu-
racy (∼104 cm1 for line positions), but the precision of the
calculations gradually decreases for higher wavenumber ranges.
The RMS of available line position ﬁts increases on average to
∼0.001 cm1 in the 3000 cm1 region, to ∼0.002 cm1 around
4000 cm1 and to ∼0.003 cm-1 in the 5000 cm1 range, primarily
because of accidental resonances. A typical example is a sharp
resonance of the (111) state interacting with the “dark” (040) state
for [J,Ka]¼ [44, 4] that was not included in the effective model.
This resonance produces a perturbation of 0.048 cm1 in line
positions and mixing of the line intensities between coupled
transitions. The upper-state energy level and six corresponding P,
Q, R- transitions have been empirically corrected both for the cold
ν1þν2þν3 and hot ν1þν2þν3-ν2 bands. The major part of the re-
latively large line position corrections (∼0.02–0.12 cm1 for about
ten transitions) to previous HITRAN line lists occurs near 2.5-mm
and corresponds to the analysis of {(103),(004),(310)}-(000) bands
by Perrin et al. [148]. This region is extremely complicated to
model because of the strong coupling of 9 bands including some
“exotic” resonances, for instance{(103),(004)} with (310) and
{(211),(202),(032)}. Analyses of new spectra recorded in Reims for
these bands are in progress as outlined in Refs. [120,121], but are
not yet ﬁnalized. In the meantime, empirical corrections have been
applied
to
corresponding
series
of
levels,
mostly
around
4000 cm1, and to associated transitions. This process removes
some noticeable residuals between simulated and observed ab-
sorption cross-sections.
Relative intensities of various bands play a key role in terms of
the consistency of retrieved O3 amount from different spectral
windows. From this point of view, the HITRAN2016 line list is
certainly much better than its predecessors. For example, the HI-
TRAN2016/S&MPO linelist produces 8% larger retrieved amounts
around 2182 cm1 than previous line lists, bringing this region
into better consistency with others. This improvement can be at-
tributed to the major update of the tetrad {(101),(200),(002),(030)}
bands [120,128] in the 5-mm region and conﬁrms the conclusion of
Janssen et al. [125] concerning the internal consistency of the
S&MPO
list
that
is
now
incorporated
in
HITRAN2016.
The
3000 cm1 region yields the lowest retrieved O3 amounts, about
5% lower than average, in ﬁts to MklV limb spectra and Kitt Peak
lab spectra [146]. This indicates possible errors in line widths or
intensities, since the errant line positions were corrected.
2.3.4. Future work
There remain several issues for future work. The problem of
absolute ozone intensities is still an important challenge [120,124]
requiring very precise measurements and ab initio calculations
with absolute uncertainties better than 1–3%. This concerns
Fig. 10. Intensity ratios for the 5ν3 (red circles), 3ν1þν2þν3 (blue triangles) and ν1 þ 4ν3 (olive triangles) bands between the previous HITRAN2012 line list and S&MPO data

particularly the isotopic species. New data on 17O- and 18O- con-
taining isotopologues will be produced in the near future. Mod-
eling of the complicated 2.5 mm region [120,121,148] must be
signiﬁcantly improved. In general, for the spectral intervals beyond
the fundamental bands, the effective models do not provide ex-
perimental accuracy for all lines. In order to obtain line position
accuracy that is better than 0.001 cm1 in the FTS range, which is
important for atmospheric applications, we could extend experi-
mental determination of ro-vibrational levels and systematically
replace transition frequencies by available empirical (E–E′)/h va-
lues as described in Refs. [149,150] where this approach was used
for the analysis and line lists of CRDS spectra. Further extension of
ozone spectral data to highly-excited states near the dissociation
threshold (Ref. [151] and references therein) would also be im-
portant for the understanding of the dynamics of ozone formation
and depletion [152] and for interpretation of satellite observations
involving non-LTE effects in the upper atmosphere.
2.4. N2O (molecule 4)
The N2O line list has been updated using the recently-pub-
lished line list for the 14N2
18O (14N14N 18O) isotopologue [153]. In
the immediate future, we will also add (for the ﬁrst time) the line
list that has already been constructed for the 15N2
16O (15N15N 16O)
isotopologue based on Ref. [154]. Both line lists were generated
using the results of the global modeling of the line positions and
intensities within the framework of the method of effective op-
erators. The polyad model of effective Hamiltonian (EH) [155] was
used in both cases. The parameters of the effective Hamiltonians
were ﬁt to the line positions collected from the literature. The
global RMS of the line position ﬁt for 15N2
16O is 0.0011 cm1 and
for 14N2
18O is 0.0016 cm1. The uncertainties in the ﬁtted line
positions depend on the quality of experimental data and vary
from 0.0046 cm1 to 2  106 cm1.
The line intensities were calculated using ﬁtted sets of the ef-
fective dipole moment parameters for a particular isotopologue
where possible. Note that the line intensity measurements for rare
isotopologues of N2O are very scarce. Therefore, based on the
theoretical results of Ref. [156] (in which contributions due to
isotopic substitution to the values of the effective dipole moment
parameters were shown to be negligible) the majority of the line
intensities were calculated using the effective dipole moment
parameters of the principal isotopologue [157]. The partition sums
were taken from Ref. [112] for 14N2
18O and calculated using direct
summation for 15N2
16O [154].
It is well known that the nitrous oxide EH polyad model does
not work in a totally satisfactory manner because of the existence
of a number of Coriolis and anharmonic interpolyad resonance
interactions (see, for example, Refs. [158,159]). But usually these
kinds of interactions take place in the high-wavenumber region
for the weak bands. Adopting an intensity cutoff of 1029 cm1/
molecule cm2 at 296 K, including the isotopic abundance factors
1.986  103 for 14N2
18O and 1.32  105 for 15N2
16O, overcomes
the problem of the interpolyad resonance perturbations in practice
because the most affected transitions are omitted. Nevertheless,
line parameters for the very weak bands have to be used with
caution.
For the 14N2
18O isotopologue, Toth's [160] lines given in HI-
TRAN2012 are retained and only new line parameters from the
line list of Ref. [153] are added to HITRAN2016. Line positions from
the line lists of Refs. [153,154] are assigned uncertainty code 6
(0.000001–0.00001 cm1) in the MW region and 3 (0.001–
0.01 cm1) in the IR region. For the line intensities from these line
lists, the uncertainty code 3 (> 20%) is adopted.
Line-shape parameters as well as Rosenkranz [35] line-mixing
coefﬁcients for the main isotopologue lines belonging to the ν3 ro-
vibrational band are taken from the work of Loos et al. [161]. These
parameters originate from a multispectrum ﬁt of air broadened
Fourier-Transform transmittance measurements at ambient tem-
perature. The experimental data of Loos et al. was ﬁtted using a
quadratic speed-dependent Voigt model based on the Hartmann-
Tran proﬁle [7,8,14], extended to account for line mixing in the
Rosenkranz ﬁrst-order perturbation approximation [35]. As a re-
sult, air-broadening, air-speed-dependence, air pressure shift and
line-mixing parameters were retrieved in the spectral range
2184.8 to 2251.6 cm1 for P- and R-branch lines up to J″¼ 40 and
39, respectively.
2.5. CO (molecule 5)
In order to improve the quality and consistency (between
bands and isotopologues) of the intensities of the lines of carbon
monoxide in HITRAN, a new piece-wise dipole moment function
(DMF) was created [162] using the direct ﬁt approach that was
developed in Ref. [163], supplemented with new ab initio calcu-
lations [162]. In order to ensure the best results, new experiments
were carried out in Ref. [162] for the 4–0 band and the ﬁrst
measurements of the 6–0 band were performed to add into the
direct ﬁt.
The line intensity and position calculations were performed
using this new DMF in conjunction with the wavefunctions cal-
culated from the experimentally-determined potential energy
function (PEF) from Coxon and Hajigeorgiou [164]. Calculations
were carried out using version 8.0 of LEVEL [165].
The new dipole moment function has proven to be a sub-
stantial improvement over the one used previously. In this edition
of the database it was used to calculate HITRAN intensity values in
all the bands of all isotopologues. Fig. 6 of Li et al. [162] shows a
comparison of the available experimental data in different bands
of the principal isotopologue, with new calculations, HITRAN2012,
and ab initio calculations. It is clear that intensities from Li et al.
agree much better with experimental values than previous data.
This also becomes important for the consistency of intensities
between the isotopologues (due to the use of the same dipole
moment function for all of them); previously a lot of lines for the
principal isotopologues had intensities from accurate laboratory
measurements whereas minor isotopologue intensities were still
calculated with outdated dipole moment functions. Finally, the
new work allows one to add a few more bands and also line lists
for radioactive isotopologues of carbon monoxide, which, as we
mentioned in the CO2 section, are provided in static ﬁles rather
than through the HITRANonline interface.
Apart from the intensities, the Li et al. line list features: a) line
positions calculated based on the potential energy function from
Ref. [164]; b) air- and self-broadening parameters from a sophis-
ticated semi-empirical approach, c) air-induced shift obtained for
all the lines by extrapolating measurements carried out in the 2–0
band by Devi et al. [166], where the Hartmann and Boulet [167]
approach was used for extrapolating; d) widths (and their tem-
perature dependencies) and shift due to pressure of H2 and CO2
important for planetary and combustion research were also pro-
vided employing semi-empirical approaches similar to the ones
used for air and self pressure-induced values.
We have adapted the Li et al. line list for this edition of the
HITRAN database with a few notable changes:
1) Since the original Li et al. line list was aimed at high-tempera-
ture applications, it was truncated here with an intensity cutoff
of 1031 cm1/(molecule cm2) (in natural abundance of the
isotopologues) for all the lines except those in the MW region
where a cutoff of 1042 cm1/(molecule cm2) was used to
satisfy some astrophysical applications.

2) It was found that there was a minor compatibility issue between
LEVEL and PEF from Coxon and Hajigeorgiou [164]. This resulted
in a growing (with rotational quantum number) deviation of the
calculated line positions from their real values. This has now
been ﬁxed.
3) The line positions from the high-accuracy experiments that
employ best calibration standards, including frequency combs,
were used wherever available. In the ﬁrst overtone, data from
Pollock et al. [168] were used, in the second overtone data from
Refs. [169,170] were employed, while in the ﬁfth overtone Tan
et al. line positions were taken when available [171].
4) When high-quality experimental measurements of the air- and
self-broadening and shift parameters were available in HI-
TRAN2012, they were taken in place of the semi-empirical va-
lues from Li et al. This includes the values for the speed-de-
pendent Voigt (with line mixing) proﬁle for the ﬁrst overtone
from Devi et al. [166,172].
5) Helium-broadening parameters, their temperature dependence
and pressure shift due to He were added. The broadening
parameters were taken from Sinclair et al. [173] who provide
both experimental values and values obtained from a ﬁt to a
semi-empirical model. We used experimental values where
available and semi-empirical values for all other transitions.
Although these measurements were carried out only in the
fundamental band, they were used here for all lines ignoring
vibrational dependence. The temperature dependence of this
broadening was taken to be 0.6 for all the lines based on the
average value of the measurements by Picard-Bersellini et al.
[174]. Finally, the pressure induced shifts are based on measure-
ments of Luo et al. [175] in the fundamental band and extra-
polated wherever possible to other bands using the Hartmann
and Boulet [167] approach.
2.6. CH4 (molecule 6)
The state-of–the art of methane data in the previous HITRAN
releases has been described by Brown et al. [176]. Since then,
several new studies have been in progress or have been published
both for cold and room-temperature spectra [177–183] and hot
spectra measurements [184,185], although many experimental
spectra have not yet been fully analyzed. Toon et al. [147] have
reported
some
deﬁciencies
in
available
databases
including
HITRAN2012 [1] by simulations of solar occultation spectra, ac-
quired by the JPL MkIV Fourier transform spectrometer from bal-
loon, covering the 650–5650 cm1 region. These deﬁciencies have
been addressed in this new edition, which includes superior
spectral parameters and new lines and bands for 12CH4 and 13CH4.
At this time no update was made to CH3D. An overall brief picture
of the update is given in Table 6, while the details are given in the
subsequent sections. Note that only regions where revision to
HITRAN2012 was carried out are shown. In the regions not men-
tioned in the table, HITRAN2012 line parameters have been
retained.
2.6.1. Hot bands in the spectral range below 1370 cm1
The HITRAN2012 database exhibited some noticeable pro-
blems, including those with hot band lines of 12CH4 in the low
wavenumber range. The line list in this spectral region relies on
calculations resulting from the effective Hamiltonian and dipole
moment parameter ﬁts, since extensive experimental line assign-
ments have not been performed for many years. However, extra-
polation errors have been introduced in some small spectral re-
gions that were insufﬁciently well characterized. Recently, a new
global ﬁt of methane lines including high-temperature emission
data in the 1100–1500 cm1 region was published [185]. This
study included a huge number of new assignments and allowed a
much more reliable modeling of hot-band lines. It has resulted in a
determination of effective Hamiltonian parameters. The results
were ﬁrst used to update the MeCaSDa database [186] of calcu-
lated methane lines. Fig. 11 compares the resulting computed
cross-sections with the HITRAN2012 and ExoMol [199] databases.
This plot, in logarithmic scale, clearly displays that there was likely
a problem in HITRAN2012 but better agreement of the new cal-
culated line list with Exomol.
It is well known that measurement and modeling of line in-
tensities in high-temperature spectra are quite difﬁcult, particu-
larly in non-Boltzmann conditions. In order to avoid large un-
certainties in extrapolated intensities, as was the case for some hot
bands in the previous HITRAN editions, we have checked new lists
against ab initio calculations. The line lists for hot bands resulting
from new experimental spectra analyses by Amyay et al. [185].
were compared to ﬁrst-principle variational calculations of line
intensities by Rey et al. [200,201], based on the ab initio dipole
moment and potential energy surfaces of Nikitin et al. [202–204]

as reported in the TheoReTS database [205]. An example of com-
parison is given in Fig. 12. Those bands that were in good intensity
agreement were considered sufﬁciently reliable to be incorporated
in this new HITRAN release. Some other bands require further
investigation and were not included. Note that, at this stage, these
qualitative comparisons did not involve line assignment or line
position validations.
This new calculated line list was thus used to replace some of
the HITRAN2012 lines in order to generate the HITRAN2016 up-
date, for the P1–P0 (Dyad–GS, for the ν4 band only), P1–P1 (Dyad–

Dyad), P2–P2 (Pentad–Pentad), P3–P3 (Octad–Pentad) and P4–P3
(Tetradecad–Octad) transitions (a schematic of the polyads can be
seen in Fig. 2 of Ref. [5]). Table 7 shows the spectral regions and
the number of lines that exist in MeCaSDa and what proportion of
them was adapted for HITRAN2016. It is important to mention that
validations against theoretical [205] and laboratory [185] spectra
suggested adapting the P2-P1 line list from MeCaSDa, with in-
tensities adapted from HITRAN2008 wherever possible.
It should also be noted that, recently, new highly-accurate
measurements of pure rotation lines were performed in the
Dunkerque group [206]. These lines have been included in the
global ﬁt leading to the effective Hamiltonian parameters used for
the present update.
2.6.2. 1370–4000 cm1 region
This region mainly includes the ν2 band, the Pentad bands and
relatively weak bands at the lower part of the Octad. As discussed
by Toon et al. [147], HITRAN2012 data were plagued with erro-
neous line positions for lines of intermediate strength, many of
which had been substantially superior in the HITRAN2008 edition
of the database. It was found that a large number of these lines
had been assigned line position uncertainty code 1 (i.e. between
0.1 and 1 cm1) and originate from the model used in Daumont
et al. [207]. For HITRAN2016, wherever possible in the Pentad
region, these transitions were reverted to HITRAN2008 and, where
this was not possible, line positions from Tyuterev et al. [187] were
used. Unfortunately not all problematic line positions were easy to
identify on a global scale by just the uncertainty index. Validations
against Kitt Peak FT spectra recorded at multiple thermodynamic
conditions have shown that more errors associated with line po-
sitions remained although the offending lines were not labeled
with a low uncertainty code. The most obvious outliers have been
identiﬁed and ﬁxed either by employing Ref. [187] or adjusting
line positions to ﬁt the low-pressure KP experimental spectra. This
provided a signiﬁcant improvement of the residuals, including
those discussed in Toon et al. [147].
2.6.3. 4000–4630 cm1 (correspond to strongest octad bands)
Just as for the Pentad region, HITRAN2012 data had substantial
errors in line positions for lines of intermediate strength, while
better values actually existed in the HITRAN2008 edition of the
database. However, unlike the Pentad region, the intensities of
lines in the Octad region were also often inferior to those from
HITRAN2008. Also, unlike the Pentad region, reverting line posi-
tions of HITRAN2012 lines with uncertainty code 1 to the HI-
TRAN2008 values did not always work. One should also keep in
mind that HITRAN2008 was not better than HITRAN2012 every-
where in this region. In addition to lacking 13CH4 lines in that
region, HITRAN2008 contained many duplicated transitions. Often
a transition would appear as an empirical unassigned line as well
as predictions from Hilico et al. [208]. With that being said, some
observable transitions were also missing in HITRAN2008.
The following procedure was therefore developed:
1) In the 4000–4315 cm1 region, the HITRAN2008 line list was used
as the starting point. Many unassigned empirical lines were then
given assignments and lower-state energies from corresponding
predicted Hilico et al. [208] lines, while predicted lines (usually with
inaccurate line position and intensity) were removed. In the region
4190–4315 cm1, parameters of lines with the worst remaining
residuals (with respect to low-pressure Kitt Peak FTS spectra) were
then replaced with the preliminary results of Birk et al. [188], which
used quantum assignments of yet unpublished theoretical work
[209] that was not always the same as in HITRAN2012.

2) In the 4315–4499 cm1 region, HITRAN2012 parameters were
retained.
3) In the 4499–4630 cm1 region, a mixture of HITRAN2012 with
parameters from Devi et al. (where available) was used [189].
Fig. 13 shows ﬁts to TCCON spectra measured from Park Falls,
WI, in March 2005 at a solar zenith angle of 58 deg., in windows
used by TCCON to retrieve CO. The left panels show ﬁts to the
region occupied by the CO P-branch. The right panels show ﬁts in
the R-branch region. The CO lines are less than 10% deep and so
are mainly hidden by stronger CH4 and solar lines. The upper
panels show ﬁts using HITRAN2012 CH4; the lower panels with the
HITRAN2016 CH4 linelist. The rms spectral ﬁts and the peak re-
siduals are signiﬁcantly reduced in both windows with the HI-
TRAN2016 linelist. The retrieved CH4 amounts (written over the
top right of each panel) are much more consistent between the
two windows using the HITRAN2016 linelist (0.1%), than when
using HITRAN2012 (2%). It implies that the 2016 CH4 intensities
are much more self-consistent across these two regions than in
HITRAN2012. With that being said, there is still large room for
improvements. A more consistent Octad list in terms of line
parameters and assignments is planned to be worked out for the
next HITRAN update.
2.6.4. Tetradecad range 4800–6250 cm1
Contrary to the low-energy range, in the Tetradecad range and
above, positions and intensities are mostly experimental values.
The Tetradecad of methane contains 14 bands with 60 strongly
coupled sub-bands with very congested spectra difﬁcult to analyze
because of numerous resonance perturbations. The previous HI-
TRAN2012 line list was mainly based on the analysis of Refs.
[210,211], which included about 3000 assigned lines. This was only

variational calculations, Rey et al. [205] based on ab initio dipole moment [202], and potential energy [203,204] surfaces using the line list included in the TheoReTS database
[205] (lower panel upside down in red).

11,000 and 11,500 cm1 [219]. The different polyad and corresponding quantum numbers, P, are indicated. (The polyad number P is equal to 2(V1 þ V3)þV2 þV4, where Vi
are the normal mode vibrational quantum numbers).

a partial assignment with relatively large uncertainties for about
70% of weak sub-bands. In HITRAN2016, major updates have been
included in four spectral intervals. Long-path Fourier Transform
spectra (L ¼ 1600 m) in the lower Tetradecad interval 4800–
5300 cm1 recorded in Reims have been re-analyzed by Nikitin
et al. [190]. The list includes transitions with line positions adjusted
according to their measured values and transitions with calculated
line positions, all intensities being derived from the model ﬁt. For
HITRAN2016 in the 4800–5000 cm1 region, transitions with in-
tensities greater than 1027 cm1/(molecule  cm2) were retained.
In the next interval, 5300–5550 cm1, the list contains mostly
observed positions and intensities. The analysis is in progress
[192], but a preliminary empirical line list is included in the pre-
sent release because the previous versions were quite poor in this
range.
In the interval 5550–6250 cm1, a recent version of the GOSAT line
list [193] is included. In the 2ν3 region (5855–6250 cm1), the GOSAT
line list [193] was supplemented with predominantly experimental
line parameters of the WKLMC list (Wang-Kassi-Leshchishina-Mon-
delain-Campargue) obtained from high-sensitivity laser measure-
ments in Grenoble [212]. The previous GOSAT assignments [211] in-
cluded in the HITRAN2012 list have been considerably extended in the
recent work [194] based on new analyses in the 5855–6250 cm1
range. The modeling of these complicated spectra was accomplished
using an approach combining ab initio calculations with effective
Hamiltonian (EH) ﬁts. Initial values of the EH parameters were ﬁrst
computed from the molecular potential energy surface of Nikitin et al.
[203] using irreducible tensor techniques [213,214] via the high-order
contact transformation method as described by Tyuterev et al. [187].
This information has been only partially adapted for HITRAN2016.
Indeed, the validations against experimental and atmospheric spectra
(similar to those done in Toon et al. [147]) showed that the GOSAT line
list [193] produces better residuals than the one from Ref. [194], al-
though the latter one is substantially more complete in terms of both
amount of lines and proportion of assigned lines. In the end, the
GOSAT line list [193] was supplemented with some lines from Ref.
[194] and occasionally with HITRAN2012. For instance, very accurate
line positions measured with frequency comb in Zolot et al. [215] were
retained. In the future, a more sophisticated combination of the GOSAT
line list [193] and the one from Ref. [194] will be performed. For
broadening, a combination of parameters from Lyulin et al. [191],
GOSAT line list and HITRAN2012 was used.
2.6.5. Higher wavenumber ranges
In the Icosad range (6300–7500 cm1), the WKLMC list pro-
vided empirical values of the lower-state energy levels. Recently,
on the basis of global variational ab initio spectra predictions [180],
about 13,000 transitions of 108 new bands have been assigned
[216] in the WKLMC list at 80 K and 296 K. The assigned experi-
mental list at 80 K as well as calculated ones are provided as
Supplementary Material of Rey et al. [216]. These assignments will
be transferred and extended in the WKLMC list at 296 K and in-
cluded in the next update of HITRAN.
Fig. 14 gives an overview comparison between the HITRAN2012
and HITRAN2016 lists of 12CH4 above 7920 cm1. New room-
temperature measurements by Cavity Ring Down Spectroscopy
(CRDS) in the 7920–8250 cm1 interval have allowed better
characterizing of the 1.25-mm methane transparency window [21].
In the Triacontad region (8250–9028 cm1), line parameters re-
lying on FTS measurements by Brown [42] remain unaltered with
respect to HITRAN2012. Above 9028 cm1, new FTS line para-
meters are adopted in the region of the 3ν3 band (9028–
9200 cm1) [22]. From the same FTS spectra, the ﬁrst empirical
line
list
was
retrieved
in
the
Tetracontad
region
(9520–
10,435
cm1)
[22].
It
is
worth
mentioning
that
between
7920 cm1 and 10,923 cm1 no assignments or empirical lower-
state energy values are provided except for a few tens of transi-
tions in the region of the 3ν3 band near 9046 cm1. Com-
plementary information in this case can be provided by variational
ab initio predictions [31]. The estimated error for line positions in
the best ﬁrst-principle calculation in the 1-mm range is on average
∼0.3–2 cm1; that is not sufﬁcient for high-resolution applica-
tions. However, intensities are in qualitatively good agreement
with observations, see Fig. 15. Recent ab initio intensity results
[217] for the strongest 12CH4 lines below 7600 cm1 have con-
ﬁrmed accurately measured intensity values to 1–3% on average
for the “stable” transitions non perturbed by accidental resonances.
Predicted spectra [31] include lower-state energies for all lines and
can be recalculated for various temperature conditions that make
it suitable for low- and medium-resolution modeling of observa-
tions in planetary atmospheres similar to those reported for Titan
in Ref [45].

Finally, in the 10,923–11,502 cm1 spectral range, the HITRAN
lists reproduce line parameters derived by Intracavity Laser Ab-
sorption Spectroscopy (ICLAS) [220]. For the ICLAS data [176,220],
empirical lower-state energy values were derived by the two-
temperature-method [221].
2.6.6.
13CH4 isotopologue
In HITRAN2012, the entire ν2 band of 13CH4 (centered at about
1550 cm1) was accidentally dropped from the compilation. This
band is now restored back from HITRAN2008 [198].
For the 13CH4 isotopologue, new measurements and analyses in
the 3750–4700 cm1 octad range have been reported by Brown
et al. [222] for temperatures between 80 and 296 K. This included
over 4700 positions and 3300 intensities for assigned observed
transitions. The line list based on the analysis and spectra ﬁts of
this range contains 9500 calculated lines. It is available as sup-
plementary material attached to Ref. [222] and will be in-
corporated in the next HITRAN update.
First assignments of the strongest bands at the high-wave-
number boundary of the 13CH4 Tetradecad (5852–6200 cm1 re-
gion dominated by 2ν 3) have been reported by Starikova et al.
[195]. Differential Absorption spectra (DAS) recorded in Grenoble
[223] at 80 K and 296 K have been used for this analysis. For the
80 K spectra, about 2900 lines of 3717 observed lines were as-
signed. The theoretical model in both spectral intervals, 3750–
4700 cm1 and 5852–6200 cm1, was based on the combined
approach [187] using ab initio predictions for line positions and
intensities [224] with subsequent EH ﬁts, which is similar to that
for the main 12CH4 isotopologue as outlined in Section 2.6.4 Sup-
plementary materials of Ref. [195] contain a partially-assigned
experimental DAS list at 80 K. For the present HITRAN2016 release,
the assignments were extended for the 296 K list. Note that many
observed absorption features in the congested spectrum could
have contributions from various overlapping transitions. As the
assignment criteria, the ratio R ¼ Ire-calc/{Iobs(296 K)} was used as
well as the coincidence of Jlow obtained theoretically and via the
empirical 2T-method. Here Ire-calc stands for intensities re-calcu-
lated from the 80 K DAS list via the Boltzmann factor. In doubtful
cases, but with consistent Jlow values, we have kept empirical line
parameters. For big R deviations and inconsistent Jlow values, a
default value Elow ¼ 333.3333 cm1 was applied. The self- and air-
line broadening were calculated following the method described
in the GOSAT paper [211].
Fig. 16, giving the overview of 13CH4 lines in the 2ν3 range,
shows that most of the strong and medium lines in the HI-
TRAN2016 release have consistent assignments.
An extension of this work using the approach of Ref. [216] is in
progress for the Icosad range of 13CH4 [225].
2.6.7. CH3D and other isotopologues
The parameters for this singly-deuterated methane molecule
have not been updated for the 2016 edition. We note a recent
paper by Bray et al. [226] which indicated the need for updating
the intensities of CH3D in the pure rotational band. We are con-
sidering this work for a future update of HITRAN.
2.6.8. Line-shape parameters for methane
Our knowledge of pressure broadening of methane by air, N2,
H2, He, CH4, and other gases remains incomplete, particularly for
the near-infrared and for weaker transitions in all spectral regions.
Basic coefﬁcients of Lorentz broadening (widths, shifts, tempera-
ture dependences) all vary as a function of the transition quantum
numbers, and values obtained for the fundamental bands are not
easily applicable to the very complicated polyads having multiple

underlying vibrational states. Available measured values for Lor-
entz pressure broadened line-shape parameters from the previous
edition of HITRAN were transferred into the new compilation, but
most of the lines have been given crudely-estimated air- and self-
broadened half widths, as described by Brown et al. [176]. Good
theoretical models, conﬁrmed by measurements, must be im-
plemented in order to have accurate values, not the estimates used
here for 99% of the present database. Since the release of the 2012
database, additional methane line-shape measurements have be-
come
available
in
several
spectral
regions
for
12CH4
[179,181,183,189,227–232], and CH3D [226,233,234], and these
will be added in the future updates to HITRAN2016.
The recent study of Mendonca et al. [235] illustrates the
growing evidence that for remote-sensing applications requiring
the highest accuracies of line parameters to model the observed
methane spectrum, Voigt lineshapes are inadequate. It is well
known that collisional line mixing can signiﬁcantly affect ab-
sorption spectral shapes, and line mixing cannot be neglected for
accurate
retrievals
of
atmospheric
CH4
abundance.
The
HI-
TRAN2012 database [1] had included the line-mixing parameters
for CO2, CO and O2, however without providing guidance or tools
for users to implement these parameters in their calculations. The
new structure of the HITRAN database [236] and the HITRAN
Application Programming Interface (HAPI) [5] provide the poten-
tial for the inclusion of line-mixing parameters in the database and
provide tools for their implementation.
A theoretical approach proposed to model line-mixing effects
for CH4 by Tran et al. [[237–239] has been successfully applied to
calculate absorption in the ν3, ν4 and 2ν3 bands. The same model
has been used to simulate the spectra in the ν2þν3 band as a test
to demonstrate whether it can be applied to other vibrational
bands. Comparisons with spectra measured under different pres-
sure conditions [189] show that line mixing only weakly affects
the absorption spectral line shape of this band under these pres-
sure conditions. Therefore, more calculations for other vibrational
bands under large pressure conditions are needed to demonstrate
if this model can be applied to various vibrational bands. While the
work of Tran et al. ([239] and references therein) represents sig-
niﬁcant progress in understanding non-Voigt line shapes in me-
thane, additional laboratory studies of line mixing, speed depen-
dence and narrowing are required to provide the basic parameters
for future methane compilations in the spectral regions most
utilized for remote sensing.
2.7. O2 (molecule 7)
An extensive update of the HITRAN oxygen line list for the new
edition makes use of the following signiﬁcant progress on: (1) a
self-consistent set of energy levels and line positions for the entire
HITRAN oxygen line list; (2) lineshape, line mixing, collision in-
duced absorption (CIA), and new speed-dependent Voigt (SDV)
formalism for the A-band; (3) HT proﬁle parameters for the B-
bands. We also added the b1Σ+
g (v ¼ 3)-X3Σ−
g (v ¼ 0) and b1Σ+
g (v ¼
2)-X3Σ−
g (v ¼ 1) bands.
2.7.1. Line positions and energy levels
A self-consistent set of spectroscopic constants from an up-
dated isotopically invariant Dunham ﬁt by Yu et al. in 2014 [240]
were used to update line positions and energy levels throughout
the entire HITRAN2012 oxygen line list, except for the so-called
zero-frequency lines (due to Zeeman splitting of the ground state),
see HITRAN1986 paper for details [241]. This updated Dunham ﬁt
was obtained by adding new microwave and infrared measure-
ments [242,243] to the ﬁrst global analysis of O2 by Yu et al. in
2012 [244] that simultaneously ﬁts all available experimental line
positions for all the bands and isotopologues from the microwave

324 rotational transitions in the a1Δg v ¼ 0 and 1 states of the six
O2 isotopologues and helped determine two more hyperﬁne
parameters, the electric quadrupole interaction eQq and the nu-
clear spin-rotation interaction, CI. The new infrared work [243]

differences, smaller than experimental uncertainties, were found
for measured lines and expected deviations were found for ex-
trapolated lines. As depicted in the upper left panel of Fig. 17,
systematic differences of 0.0007 cm1 were found for the 16O16O

(see discussion below).
As shown in upper right, lower left and lower right panels of
Fig. 17, deviations are very small for one sub-group of the A-band
transitions while they are large for another sub-group. The sub-
group of transitions with small deviations belongs to the PO, PP, PQ
branches while the other sub-group with large deviations belongs
to the NO, RR, RQ, RS and TS branches.
2.7.2. A-band region near 762 nm
The line list for the A-band in HITRAN2012 originates from the
data from the Long et al. [250,251] papers. Here an update of the
principal isotopologue magnetic dipole allowed transitions is gi-
ven that incorporates a self-consistent model of collisional line-
shapes, collisional line mixing and collision induced absorption in
a multispectrum ﬁt to a wide range of experimental data sets
described in Drouin et al. [252] (hereafter referred to as Drouin
2017). The lineshape chosen was the speed-dependent Voigt
proﬁle and effects of line mixing were introduced as a ﬁxed
W-matrix derived from the theoretical line mixing formalism of
Tran, Boulet and Hartmann in 2006 [253]. Strong correlation was
observed between the scaled line-mixing parameterization and
the collision-induced absorption derived as remaining non-re-
sonant absorption. Correlation was also observed between the
line-by-line parameters correlations in the R-branch band-head
region and the scaled line-mixing parameterization. The self and
air-broadening parameters as well as air-pressure shift parameters
do not deviate signiﬁcantly from HITRAN 2012, with smooth
trends that closely match the polynomial expressions of Long et al.
that were used in the prior compilation. Unlike HITRAN 2012,
minor erratic deviations of these parameters (which were mini-
mized in the chosen scaling of the line mixing) are retained in the
compilation for self-consistency. The self-pressure shift para-
meters are provided for the ﬁrst time in this HITRAN edition, and
these values differ systematically by 0.006 cm1atm1 from those
given by Long et al. [251]. The air broadening temperature de-
pendence is also systematically shifted to higher values in com-
parison to HITRAN 2012. The self-broadening temperature de-
pendence is also provided for this band for the ﬁrst time in
HITRAN and it is even more systematically shifted in comparison
to published values from Brown & Plymate [254]. Temperature
dependences of the pressure-shift are also included in the new
line-by-line parameterization; there is no prior parameterization
for comparisons of these values. The ﬁnal ﬁtted line-by-line
parameter is the ‘speed-dependence’ of the pressure broadening,
which replaces the Dicke parameter determined in Long's work
and included in the supplemental listing of HITRAN 2012. Quali-
tative comparison of these two ‘narrowing’ parameters shows that
there is a similar m dependence in each parameter set, each with a
more pronounced slope at m o 0 (the P-branch). Use of the speed-
dependent Voigt allows this lineshape proﬁle to be cast within the
more encompassing Hartmann-Tran proﬁle. Line-by-line line-
mixing parameters (Rosenkranz parameters) were not ﬁtted in
Drouin 2017 [252], but rather a full W-matrix formalism based on
theoretical work, empirically modiﬁed to improve the multi-
spectrum ﬁt quality, was implemented. The empirical corrections
that attenuated line mixing at high rotational excitation (see Tran
and Hartmann, [255]) were abandoned in favor of the removal of
mixing between differing spin-states. The effects of this correction
are clearly evident in the derived Rosenkranz parameters, which
oscillate between even and odd J (or m) values when the spin-
changing collisional mixing is allowed, but follow a smooth trend
with J (or m) when they are removed. Predoi-Cross et al. [256,257]
provide ﬁtted room-temperature Rosenkranz parameters (and
other lineshape parameters) that agree with the parameters of
Drouin 2017. The modiﬁed line mixing parameterization sig-
niﬁcantly alters the derived collision-induced absorption, with this
absorption appearing narrower and stronger, with a shape and
extent that conforms more closely to the resonant band. The col-
lision-induced absorption derived for air is provided separately in
the corresponding section of the HITRAN database, see Section 4
for details.
For the convenience of HITRAN users, two transformations have
been applied to the line-shape/line- mixing parameterization gi-
ven by Drouin 2017. First, given the primary usage of the oxygen
database to model the Earth's atmosphere, the foreign-broadening
line-shape parameters presented in Drouin 2017 have been con-
verted to air-broadening parameters using the binary mixing ratio
[N2]:[O2] ¼ 0.79:0.21. Second, the scaled, full-W-matrices for for-
eign and self line mixing and the associated temperature depen-
dence were evaluated for 1 atm of air at four ‘standard’ tempera-
tures and then composed into ﬁrst order line-by-line Rosenkranz
parameters. This representation of the line mixing is based on
similar representations provided for the ﬁne-structure line mixing
in the microwave spectrum and is both easier to tabulate as well as
more efﬁcient to compute. We note that the multidimensional
oxygen A-band cross-section table (ABSCO 5.0), now in use for the
reduction of OCO-2 [64] atmospheric data, utilizes the para-
meterization of Drouin 2017 in its native form, and was calculated
with the same source code as the multi-spectrum ﬁtting program.
The differences between the ABSCO 5.0 table and the HITRAN
database are due to the two cosmetic modiﬁcations indicated
above, as well as the replacement of line centers with the more
precise values derived from the work of Yu et al. [240] described
above.

was available for intensities, and this atmospheric spectrum was
used to scale the intensities to ﬁt the observations. We also note
that line positions used in HITRAN2016 for this band differ from
those in Yu et al. [240]. This is due to the fact that the measure-
ments in Ref. [258] were carried out using a relatively high pres-
sure of oxygen. It is accounted for in the ﬁt here but not com-
pletely in Ref. [240]. Broadening and shift parameters for this band
were estimated using the approach described in Gordon et al.
[259]. Fig. 18b shows that the inclusion of this band makes the
difference and it was included into HITRAN2016.
In a similar fashion it was discovered that it is important to
include the

band (basically a hot band
underlying the B-band). Intensities for this band were also de-
termined based on atmospheric spectra.
Finally, the UV bands of oxygen are not stored separately any-
more and one can retrieve them from www.hitran.org in the same
manner as the other bands.
2.7.4. B-band
Recently Domysławska et al. [260] developed a dataset of the
line-shape parameters for the B-band of self-broadened O2 (the
main isotopologue),
based
on accurate
CRDS
measurements
[261,262]. The dataset includes 49 lines from the P and R branches.
It was observed that, at the considered level of signal-to-noise
ratio, the spectra are well reproduced by the speed-dependent
Voigt proﬁle with quadratic speed dependence. In the near future
we plan to incorporate these data into HITRAN within the form-
alism of the Hartmann-Tran proﬁle by setting the frequency of the
velocity-changing collisions, νVC, and the correlation parameter, η,
to zero.
2.8. NO (molecule 8)
Nitric oxide is an important constituent of the terrestrial at-
mosphere, where it is commonly detected and quantiﬁed by its
fundamental IR band. The rotational spectrum plays an important
role for the detection in diverse interstellar sources, but may also
be used for detection in the Earth's upper atmosphere; Müller
et al. [263] give a brief overview with appropriate references.
Positions and intensities for all stable NO isotopologues and for
the ﬁrst excited state in the pure rotation transition (1-1) of the
principal isotopologue were based on Müller et al. [263] who
performed a combined ﬁt of all available rotational data together
with heterodyne IR data of the fundamental band of the main
species. All experimental data were carefully evaluated, a few
poorly-ﬁtting transition frequencies were omitted, and the un-
certainties of some additional data were slightly adjusted as de-
tailed in Ref. [263].
The 14N16O line position and intensity data consist of milli-
meter and lower submillimeter data from Pickett et al. [264] and
tunable far-IR data from Varberg et al. [265] in v ¼ 0. The Λ-
doubling transitions in v ¼ 0 were mainly taken from Meerts and
Dymanus [266]; additional data were taken from Refs. [267,268].
Further Λ-doubling transitions in v ¼ 0 and 1 were taken from
Dale et al. [269] and Lowe et al. [270]. Also used in the ﬁt were the
v ¼ 1–0 heterodyne IR data from Hinz et al. [271] and the very
accurate data from Saupe et al. [272].
Millimeter and lower submillimeter data of 15N16O were con-
tributed by Saleck et al. [273], and tunable far-IR data by Varberg
et al. [265]. The Λ-doubling transitions were taken from Meerts
and Dymanus [266]. Millimeter and lower submillimeter data of
the isotopologue 14N18O were also published by Saleck et al. [273],
and tunable far-IR data by Müller et al. [263]. Finally, millimeter
data of 14N17O and 15N18O were taken from Saleck et al. [274].
A very accurate value of the ground-state electric dipole
moment of 14N16O was published in Ref. [268]; a value for v ¼ 1
was determined in Ref. [275]. The strength of the magnetic dipole
transition was derived from the electron spin-rotation parameter γ
employing Curl's relationship [276] to evaluate the g-factor of the
respective isotopologue and in the appropriate vibrational state.
The data set has been extended considerably by FTIR data of
14N16O reaching high v and by FTIR data of minor isotopic species
from Ref. [277]. This will be used for future editions of HITRAN and
HITEMP [278]. The spectroscopic model developed in this study
has also been used to compute g-factors for the system [279].
2.9. SO2 (molecule 9)
Since the 2008 edition of HITRAN, the air-broadening coefﬁ-
cients of sulfur dioxide have been a constant, γair¼ 0.1025 cm1,
for line positions lower than 3000 cm1; with γair ¼ 0.1 cm1 for
line positions larger than 3000 cm1 (see HITRAN2008 paper
[198] for details). Recently, new measurements have been made of
the air-broadening coefﬁcients of SO2 from infrared and sub-
millimeter-wave spectra [280,281]. When analyzing these data
together with previously available experiments [282–285], a slow
decrease of the air-broadening coefﬁcients with increasing (J″ þ
0.2Ka″) lower-state quantum number combination was observed
(see the report by Tan et al. [286] for details). The vibrational
dependence of the broadening parameters is demonstrated to be
very small or negligible.

(with error code 4 (10–20%)) was used, while for the transitions
with (J″ þ 0.2Ka″) > 62, the value corresponding to the experi-
mental value with the largest (J″ þ 0.2Ka″) was used.

A complete line-by-line database of room temperature self-
broadening coefﬁcients for about 1650 SO2 transitions has been
compiled by Tasinato et al. [287]. These data are used to update
the self-broadening coefﬁcients for the corresponding transitions.
The error code has been set to 5, since we estimate the accuracy to
be 5–6%. We also use the average values from Ref. [287] (with error
code 4) of the same quantum numbers (J″, Ka″) for all the other
transitions with corresponding rotational quantum numbers. More
details about this update of air and self-broadening parameters
can be found in the report by Tan et al. [286].
Another update to the SO2 data is the addition of pressure
shifts, line widths and their temperature-dependence exponents
in H2, He and CO2 environments for every HITRAN transition. This
update is described in detail by Wilzewski et al. [4]. While shifts of
the SO2 lines due to H2, He or CO2 were set to the default value of
zero for every line because no reports of these parameters exist in
available peer-reviewed sources, broadening parameters and their
temperature
exponents
have
been
added
based
on
Refs.
[280,281,284,288,289]. Especially in the case of the SO2–CO2 sys-
tem, the amount of available data used to construct the line list of
broadening parameters is minimal, and future measurements of
the SO2–H2, -He and -CO2 systems would help to improve the
present semi-empirical parameter sets.
There has been signiﬁcant recent progress in the computation
of extensive, accurate theoretical line lists for both room tem-
perature [290,291] and hot [292] SO2. The intensities in these line
lists are accurate enough to provide alternatives for missing bands
of both the main and the minor isotopologues; this should be
considered in future updates. They can be supplemented with line
positions calculated using constants from recent works from Ule-
nikov et al. [293–297] and references therein.

2.10. NO2 (molecule 10)
Unchanged.
2.11. NH3 (molecule 11)
NH3 is a very important constituent of the atmospheres of giant
planets and small, cold stars. It is also abundant in various en-
vironments of the interstellar medium and occurs in the terrestrial
atmosphere. The isotopologue with 15 N can be very important for
studying isotopic fractionation or for studying the opacity of lines
pertaining to 14NH3.
Positions and intensities of the 15NH3 pure-tunneling and ro-
tation-tunneling transitions were taken from the CDMS. It is based
on rotation-tunneling transition frequencies from Belov et al. [298]
and Winnewisser et al. [299], on pure tunneling data from Kuko-
lich [300], in part corrected by Hougen [301], and from Sasada
[302]. Also included are FIR data from Urban et al. [303] and
Carlotti et al. [304]. Initial spectroscopic parameters were taken
from a modiﬁed ﬁt of 14NH3 data by Chen et al. [305]. Quantum
chemical calculations and trial ﬁts suggested that the C rotational
constant cannot be determined reliably from these data. Therefore,
its value was kept ﬁxed to the 14NH3 value derived from Ref. [306]
modiﬁed by the 14NH3/15NH3 difference calculated from energies
calculated by Huang et al. [306]. The dipole moment and its ﬁrst
order J and K distortion corrections were taken from Tanaka et al.
[307]. The rotation-tunneling transitions extend to J ¼ 14 [304],
and the pure tunneling transitions [302] even higher in J. The
predictions should show FIR accuracy at least up to J ¼ 14, but
predictions higher than J ¼ 15 should be viewed with increasing
caution. Moreover, frequencies and possibly also intensities of the
weak ΔK ¼ 3 transitions should be viewed with some caution.
HITRAN2012

transitions
up
to
7000 cm1. Recently, Barton et al. [308] analyzed Fourier Trans-
form (FT) absorption spectra recorded at the National Solar Ob-
servatory by C. De Bergh in 1980, providing partially-assigned lists
of measured line positions and intensities. The present update
includes 8468 lines in the region 7400–8640 cm1 [308]; 2474 of
these lines are fully assigned using the quantum numbers re-
commended by Down et al. [309]. Barton et al. [310] have also
analyzed and partially assigned a further spectrum covering the
8800 to 10,400 cm1 region. These data were also included in
HITRAN2016.
At lower wavenumbers, comparisons between the HITRAN data
and comprehensive variational line lists [311,312] give good agree-
ment below 4000 cm1. However, comparisons with these line lists
suggest that the current HITRAN compilation is missing a signiﬁcant
number of lines in the 4000–7000 cm-1 region. Attempts to resolve
this problem using a combination of available variational line lists
referred to as BYTe [311,312] and empirical energy levels provided
using the MARVEL procedure [313] to give a hybrid line list referred
to as “BARVEL” proved to be inferior to HITRAN2012 when compared
with cross sections from PNNL [314]. It would appear that further
work is needed on both the computed line list and the MARVEL
dataset in this region. Work in both these directions is currently
being undertaken and, in particular, a new high-accuracy ab initio
potential energy surface [315] should provide a much better starting
point for improved nuclear motion calculations.

Pressure-broadening coefﬁcients and their temperature de-
pendence exponent were calculated from the polynomial coefﬁ-
cients of Nemtchinov et al. [316] derived from the ν2 band mea-
surements. Nemtchinov et al. suggested that the rotational de-
pendence of the air- and self-broadening half width, γair and γself,
can be represented using the following polynomial:

where m ¼ |  J, J, J þ 1| for the P, Q and R branches, and βi are
the polynomial coefﬁcients. This polynomial was used only for J
r 8 with error code 6 for both γair and γself, and for the other
transitions with, J > 8 the extrapolated value corresponding to the
largest J and K was used. For instance, when J > 8 the default va-
lues γair¼ 0.0906 cm1/atm and γself¼ 0.5 cm1/atm have been
used for all these transitions, and the error code has been set to
5 for both γair and γself.
The temperature dependence exponents have also been mea-
sured in the ν2 band by Nemtchinov et al. [316] but for broadening
by O2 and N2 separately. We note that in the literature many re-
searchers determine the temperature exponent to be

The broadening algorithm described above as well as the
temperature dependence procedure is also used throughout the
entire database for both isotopologues 14NH3 and 15NH3.
Semi-empirical line widths, pressure shifts and temperature-
dependence exponents of ammonia perturbed by H2, He and CO2
have been added to the database for the ﬁrst time based on the
algorithm described in Wilzewski et al. [4]. This algorithm makes
use of the results from Refs. [316–320] (for H2), Refs. [317,319–325]
(for He) and Refs. [321,326,327] (for CO2). Even though the new
parameters were constructed from a relatively large number of
data-reporting articles, the database would proﬁt from future
studies of NH3 absorption lines perturbed by H2, He and CO2 for
validation purposes as described in Ref. [4].
2.12. HNO3 (molecule 12)
For nitric acid (HNO3), the three strongest absorption band
systems, namely the {ν5, 2ν9}, {ν3, ν4} interacting bands, and the ν2
band, are located at 11, 7.6 and 5.8 mm respectively. Although two
times weaker than the bands observed in the two other ranges,
the 11-mm band system is of particular atmospheric interest since
it coincides with a rather clear atmospheric window. As the HI-
TRAN2012 database [1] provides a reliable description of the nitric

acid spectrum at 11 mm (the line list includes the ν5 and 2ν9 cold
bands for the H14N16O3 and H15N16O3 isotopologues, as well as the
ν5þν9–ν9, 3ν9–ν9, ν5þν7–ν7 and ν5þν6–ν6 hot bands of H14N16O3),
this region is used for HNO3 retrievals by numerous satellite or
balloon-borne instruments [328–333].
However, retrievals of nitric acid at altitudes higher than
∼35 km, where it is less abundant, require use of the stronger
infrared signatures at 5.8 or 7.6 mm. Because the ﬁrst spectral re-
gion overlaps rather strongly with water vapor absorption in at-
mospheric spectra, the 7.6-mm band system is preferable. However,
most satellite or balloon-borne instruments avoided using this
latter region up to now for HNO3 retrievals because of the poor
quality of the available HNO3 line positions and line intensities.
For HNO3, the 7.6-mm spectral region in HITRAN2012 is limited
to the ν3 and ν4 cold bands of the main isotopologue, H14N16O3. In
addition, the quality of the line positions and intensities available
therein is rather poor, mainly because the theoretical model used
at that time [334] accounted only for the interactions coupling
energy levels belonging to the ν3 and ν4 bright states but was
neglecting interactions with several dark states present in the
same energy range.
Therefore it was decided to update the HNO3 line list at 7.6 mm.
First, a complete reinvestigation of the line positions for nitric acid
at 7.6 mm was performed [335]. In contrast to the previous analysis
[334], the new Hamiltonian model accounted properly for the
various vibration-rotation resonances and torsional effects affect-
ing the ν3 and ν4 bright states and the four dark states 2ν6, 3ν9,
ν5 þ ν9 and ν7 þν8. Additionally, the ν3þν9–ν9 hot band was
identiﬁed for the ﬁrst time [335].
At the end of this ﬁrst study [335], a new list of line positions
and of preliminary line intensities was generated. This list in-
cluded contribution from the ν3 and ν4 cold bands, the 2ν6, 3ν9,
ν5þν9, ν7þν8 dark bands, and the ν3þν9–ν9 hot band of the main
isotopologue. The ﬁnal line intensities at 7.6 mm were generated
through a calibration process during which the HNO3 vol mixing
ratio proﬁles retrieved from the “Michelson Interferometer for
Passive Atmospheric Sounding” (MIPAS) limb emission radiances
in the 11- and 7.6-mm domains were compared. This line list at
7.6 mm, which was also validated using the available laboratory
information (individual line intensities and absorption cross sec-
tions), proved to provide an improved description of the 7.6-mm
region absorption of nitric acid [336].
Table 8 compares the HNO3 line lists at 7.6 mm given in the 2012
and 2016 releases of HITRAN showing signiﬁcant changes. Finally,
Fig. 20 compares the observed spectrum in the 7.6-mm spectral
region (laboratory spectrum recorded in Giessen) to synthetic
spectra generated using HITRAN2012 and HITRAN2016 showing
the improvements brought by the new data as shown by the re-
siduals. In conclusion, it is expected that this study should help to
improve HNO3 satellite retrievals by allowing measurements to be
performed simultaneously in the 11- and 7.6-mm spectral regions.
In the HITRAN2008 paper, the several-item roadmap for the
improvements to the nitric acid spectroscopy was presented. A
majority of these problems have now been solved. However, the
biggest challenge still remains, the lack of a line-by-line list for the
ν1 band of HNO3 centered at 3551 cm1. It is a pronounced feature
that interferes with other gases absorbing at these wavenumbers.
Fig. 5 in the paper by Toon et al. [147] shows how the lack of
spectroscopic parameters negatively affects retrievals from the Mk
IV balloon observations. Low-resolution spectra of this band exist
in the PNNL database [314] but at a limited set of thermodynamic
conditions, while ab initio calculations for this molecule [337,338]
do not yet allow accurate atmospheric retrievals.
2.13. OH (molecule 13)
The line list for the hydroxyl radical remained unchanged. The
recent study by Brooke et al. [339] could be considered for up-
dating intensities of the weak lines (this is more relevant for HI-
TEMP [278]) in the near future.
2.14. HF (molecule 14)
Transitions of HF with changes in vibrational quantum number,
Δv, larger than 10 were removed from the database along with
transitions with Δv > 8 for DF. This removal was carried out be-
cause there were numerical issues in calculating the intensities of
these transitions. Medvedev et al. [340] explain how the use of
double precision in calculating overtone intensities may lead to
numerical errors and that quadruple precision is needed. Addi-
tional numerical errors occur depending on the interpolation
techniques used for the dipole moment functions as explained in
Medvedev et al. [341].
Broadening, shifting and temperature-dependence parameters
of HF due to the pressure of H2, He and CO2 have been added to
HITRAN for the ﬁrst time. The semi-empirical procedure described
in Wilzewski et al. [4] was developed using results from Ref. [342]
(for H2), Refs. [343–345] (for CO2) and Refs. [346–348] (for He). To
expand and validate the present parameters, more measurements
are needed, while it would also be valuable to have more dedi-
cated data for DF.
2.15. HCl (molecule 15)
The intensity issue mentioned above for HF concerning the
removal of high overtones of all isotopologues was likewise ap-
plied to HCl (i.e. transitions with Δv > 8 were removed for all four
isotopologues of hydrogen chloride).
Ref. [4] describes in detail the addition of H2-, He- and CO2-
broadening, -shifting and temperature-dependence parameters of
HCl to the database. Semi-empirical HCl-CO2 broadening and
shifting parameters for each HITRAN transition are based on Refs.
[345,349] and sophisticated extrapolations of these results, while
Refs. [350,351] were used to construct HCl-He linewidths and
shifts. For the HCl-H2 system, the new parameters are based on
Refs. [352–355]. In the future, measurements of the temperature-
dependence of foreign-broadened HCl spectral lines will be very
helpful additions to the database.

Carbonyl sulﬁde is the most abundant sulfur-containing species in
the free troposphere, often monitored using optical remote sensing in
the 5-mm region [356]. OCS is present in the atmosphere of Venus
[357]. The increasing interest for the application of very sensitive
cavity ring down spectroscopy to the in situ detection of trace species
[358] makes the near infrared range more and more attractive.

information for OCS only up to 4200 cm–1 [1]. Recently, Fourier
transform spectra of carbonyl sulﬁde were recorded between 6170 and
6680 cm–1 and between 7700 and 8160 cm–1 using a femto/OPO laser
absorption source and cavity enhanced spectroscopy [359]. The
strongest bands observed in these two regions are 3ν1þ2ν3 (near
6640 cm–1) and 2ν1þ3ν3 (near 7812 cm–1), respectively. The line po-
sitions thus measured (with an accuracy estimated to be 0.001 cm–1
for not-too-weak unblended lines) were used to update a global
polyad model of carbonyl sulﬁde (see Ref. [360] and references
therein).
This global polyad model was then used to generate a list of
line positions, assignments, lower-state energies, and relative in-
tensities for the main isotopologue. Because quantitative intensity
information could not be retrieved from the measured spectra, the
predicted relative intensities had to be scaled relying on additional
information. A scaling factor was determined for each of the two
spectral regions by matching calculated spectra of the 3ν1þ2ν3
and 2ν1þ3ν3 bands to their Fourier transform spectra, recorded
previously [360]. Because predicted relative intensities only make
sense for transitions involving levels belonging to the same poly-
ads, these two scaling factors could only be applied to bands
corresponding to transitions involving upper vibrational levels
belonging to the same polyads as the upper levels of the 3ν1þ2ν3
and 2ν1þ3ν3 bands. Line intensities could therefore be obtained
for cold bands matching this constraint, and hot bands involving
variations of the vibrational quantum numbers identical to these
cold bands (thus assuming that the vibrational dependence of the
transition moments is negligible). Because isotopic substitution is
not expected to signiﬁcantly change the transition moments, line
intensities were also obtained for the same bands belonging to
16O12C34S, 16O13C32S and 16O12C33S. All these predicted bands cover
the ranges 6484–6650 cm–1 (region A) and 7728–7821 cm–1 (re-
gion B). These two regions, involving a total of 3660 predicted
lines, are presented in Figs. 13 and 14 of Ref. [359]. Note that only
lines having intensities larger than 3.0  10–28 (region A) and
6.7  10–28 (region B) cm–1/(molecule cm–2) at 296 K were con-
sidered. These intensity thresholds are slightly lower than the
experimental limits. The supplementary material of Ref. [359] also
includes a list of line positions, assignments, and lower-state en-
ergies for 3417 additional lines of 16O12C32S, 16O12C34S, 16O13C32S
and 16O12C33S, covering the 6200–6449 cm–1 and 7901–8120 cm–1
ranges. Because of the constraint mentioned above, the relative
intensities of these lines could not be scaled and were set to zero,
and they were not included in HITRAN2016.
The spectroscopic information included in the new edition of
HITRAN is the data of regions A and B obtained as described above,
to which 10 lines belonging to the 2ν1þ2ν2°þ2ν3 band of the
16O13C32S isotopologue (between 6650 and 6660 cm–1) were ad-
ded. The origin of this band is located near 6650.773 cm–1. Relying
on predictions of the global polyad model, which turned out to be
as close as a few 10–3 cm–1 to the observed positions, 17 P and R
branch lines of the 2ν1þ2ν2°þ2ν3 band of 16O13C32S could be
observed, their positions measured in the spectra of Ref. [359] and
included in the global modeling to yield improved predictions.
These improved predictions are included in this edition of HITRAN.
Note that the upper level of this band is the highest ever observed
for 16O13C32S. In the supplementary material of Ref. [359], 152
pairs of upper vibrational levels have identical assignments as a
result of the combined effects of heavy mixing near avoided
crossings and the assignments of the levels being based on the
largest coefﬁcient of their eigenvectors. To remove these duplicate
assignments, one vibrational level in each pair was manually re-
assigned through careful examination of the corresponding energy
level structures. Additionally, it was found that the line intensities
provided in the supplementary material of Ref. [359] could be
affected by the number of signiﬁcant digits used when storing
intermediate results. The line intensities provided in this edition of
HITRAN correct this problem and are listed with the appropriate
number of signiﬁcant digits. The HITRAN line list for OCS contains
self- and air-broadening coefﬁcients for all the lines calculated
using the Padé approximant proposed of Koshelev and Tretyakov
[361].
H2-, He- and CO2-broadened linewidths of OCS were added to
HITRAN for the ﬁrst time based on semi-empirical models derived
in Wilzewski et al. [4]. The following experimental data were used
to derive these models: Ref. [362] (for H2), Refs. [362–365] (for He)
and Ref. [366] (for CO2). There are no lineshifts and temperature-
dependence parameters due to H2, He or CO2 available in the
literature.

2.21. HOCl (molecule 21)
The ν2 band region of hypochlorous acid, HOCl, was ﬁrst in-
troduced in HITRAN2004 [3] based on the line list from Vander
Auwera et al. [367]. It was found that 49 lines of the principal
isotopologue of HOCl in HITRAN had an incorrect vibrational as-
signment being attributed to the ν2 band, while in reality they are
2ν3 lines. Also, the quantum rotational assignment of the line at
1237.62928 cm1 was incorrect. All of the assignments are now
ﬁxed, based on the correct information provided in the original
publication [367].
2.22. N2 (molecule 22)
It was found that the abundance of the 14N15N isotopologue
was incorrectly calculated in the original release of HITRAN2012;
this issue with the intensities has been ﬁxed in the latest edition.
2.23. HCN (molecule 23)
Hydrogen cyanide is a trace atmospheric species that can result
from biomass burning [368–370]; its presence in the troposphere
is being routinely monitored [371,372]. The use of HCN spectra for
diagnostic applications in medicine are also being investigated
[373]. HCN, and its isomer HNC (which is not yet in HITRAN), are
important astronomical species with, for example, the recent
tentative detection of HCN in the super-Earth exoplanet 55 Cancri
e [374].
The spectrum of 1H12C14N at wavenumbers below 3500 cm1
has been included in HITRAN for some time. Here we extend the
data available to higher wavenumbers. These data were based on
the semi-empirical line list generated by Barber et al. [375] as part
of the ExoMol project [376]. For full line lists appropriate for
higher temperatures and covering both HCN and HNC the reader
should consult these sources directly.
HITRAN has been updated with
1H12C14N lines for wave-
numbers above 3500 cm1 and limited to transitions which have
intensity greater than 1029 cm1/(moleculecm2); these cri-
teria give a total of 55,153 lines in that spectral region. Wave-
numbers for the majority of these lines were taken from the em-
pirical energy levels of Mellau [377,378]. However, transition in-
tensities are ones computed by Harris et al. [379] using the ab
initio dipole moment and potential energy surface of Van Mourik
et al. [380]. The Harris et al. calculations are not sufﬁciently ac-
curate for transition frequencies but the evidence is that the
transition intensities can be considered fairly reliable [381]. An
overview of the HCN line list in HITRAN2016 is given in Fig. 21.
The air-broadening half widths were calculated using semi-

empirical expressions derived in Yang et al. [382]. Self-broadening
parameters were calculated using the procedure explained in the
HITRAN2004 paper [3], see Eq. (20) there and discussion around it.
2.24. CH3Cl (molecule 24)
The parameters of methyl chloride for 43,147 lines (7079 of
which are new), were calculated based on a recent analysis [383]
of Fourier transform spectra in the range of 1900–2600 cm1. The
data from the supplementary ﬁle of Ref. [383] were used in the
update. The error code 4 was given for line positions and the error
code 5 (5–10%)- for line intensities, see Ref. [383] for details on
uncertainties. We also recalculated the Einstein A coefﬁcients for
the lines which had changed intensities. In addition, a couple of
issues that have been identiﬁed in the 3-mm region of CH3Cl in
HITRAN2012 were ﬁxed. In particular, the air-broadening tem-
perature dependencies, nair, of the lines around 3 mm used to be
negative while they are supposed to be positive. And all of the
lines in the 3-mm band have a shift of 0.02 cm1/atm. We
compared the calculated spectra from the HITRAN database with
the PNNL database [314] and the results show that such a strong
shift of the lines appears to be incorrect. Therefore the shifts were
set to be zero and nair to be positive around 3 mm. In a similar
fashion we removed the shift of 0.02 cm1/atm in the ν2þν6
band around 5 mm.
Both experimental measurements and calculations have been

made of the self- and air- broadening coefﬁcients of CH3Cl recently,
allowing for a relatively sophisticated update of these parameters in
HITRAN. The available results have been collected and evaluated to
update the database for CH3Cl. The details are as follows:
For self-broadening coefﬁcients of CH3Cl:
1. The CH3
35Cl self-broadening coefﬁcients at reference tempera-
ture 296 K for the R-branch (ΔK¼ 0) were computed using a
semi-empirical (SE) method described by Dudaryonok et al.
[384]. We used these semi-empirical calculations for R-branch
and P-branch (for all ΔK values) lines in all of the bands of the
two isotopologues CH3
35Cl and CH3
37Cl considered in the
database. The average value of RMS-deviations of the SE CH3Cl
self-broadening coefﬁcients from the experimental data of Ref.
[385] is 0.0408 cm1/atm. We used the ratio of the individual
half widths to this value to estimate the uncertainties and
determine a corresponding error code.
Only R-branch transitions for quantum number ranges of 0 rJ
r 70, 0 rKr 20 are available from Ref. [1]. The empirical
relation enables evaluation of the P-branch and Q-branch
broadening coefﬁcients from those of the R-branch

2. Experimental results collected from the literature were applied
to corresponding transitions with the same J and K. These ex-
perimental values supersede the calculated ones:
(a) Experimental results from Ref [386]. are used for the same
isotopologue, ( J′,K′-J″,K″) transitions in all of the bands, with
the error code set to 5 (5–10%).
(b) Experimental results from Ref [385]. are for both pure
rotational ( J ¼ 6, 31, 37, 40, 45, 50) and ν1 bands of CH3Cl.
The measured self-broadening coefﬁcients for pure rota-
tional transitions are used for the corresponding transitions
in the database. Experimental results for the ν1 band are
used for transitions sharing the same quantum numbers
throughout other bands.
For air-broadening coefﬁcients of CH3Cl:
1. The air-broadening coefﬁcients and associated temperature
exponents for both CH3
35Cl and CH3
37Cl ro-vibrational transi-
tions of R-branches (ΔK ¼ 0) are calculated by a semi-classical
(SC) approach [387]. The SC calculation are used for R-branch
and P-branch (for all ΔK values) lines in all of the bands
assuming γP(J,K) E γR(J 1,K).
2. Experimental results from Ref. [388] and Ref. [389] are used for
the transitions sharing the same rotational quantum numbers.
For air-broadening temperature dependencies of CH3Cl:
The air-broadening temperature exponents have been updated
using the SC calculations of Buldyreva [387]. Only the ro-vibra-
tional transitions of R-branches and P-branches were calculated.
The values for Q-branches were kept at the constant value of 0.70
for nP(J,K) E nR( J 1,K).
2.25. H2O2 (molecule 25)
For hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, the measurements of the air-broad-
ening half widths from Refs. [390–392] were included for the corre-
sponding transitions. The majority of the air-broadened coefﬁcients in
the database still have the same value of 0.1 cm-1/atm estimated from
the measurements of Malathy Devi et al. [392].
Currently the H2O2 line list contained in HITRAN only covers
wavelengths longer than 5 mm. PNNL [314] and recent ab initio
calculations [393,394] show strong features near 2.75 mm asso-
ciated with the OH stretch. More laboratory work is needed to
obtain reliable line lists in that region.
2.26. C2H2 (molecule 26)
New bands of acetylene from the wavenumber regions 13 
248 cm–1 and 390  634 cm–1 were added using the results of
Refs. [395–397]. The new data incorporated into HITRAN2016 are
based mainly on the global modeling of both line positions and
intensities performed in Tomsk within the framework of the
method of effective operators [395]. The new measurements per-
formed by Jacquemart et al. [397] considerably extend the avail-
able experimental data in the 390–634 cm1 region and allow an
increase in the number of the ﬁtted effective dipole moment
(EDM) parameters responsible for the line intensities in the 13–
634 cm1 region. This extended set of EDM parameters has better
extrapolation abilities compared to that published in Ref. [395].
Using the eigenfunctions of the effective Hamiltonian from Ref.
[395] and the new set of EDM parameters, a new list of line po-
sitions and intensities was generated. This list was used to update
the C2H2 line list in the 13  248 cm–1 and 390  634 cm–1
regions.
Global modeling of the rovibrational energies of the bending
vibrational states has also been performed in the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory (JPL) [396] using an EH for the bending modes. The
comparisons to the observed line positions showed that the JPL
calculated line positions are slightly closer to the observations for
the high values of the angular momentum quantum numbers than
those derived from Ref. [395]. Thus it was decided to use JPL line
positions (when available) for these bands.
The line list has been completed by other parameters (self- and
air-broadening coefﬁcients, temperature exponents of air-broad-
ening coefﬁcients, air-shift coefﬁcients) as described in Section 4
of Jacquemart et al. [398].
Uncertainty codes 4 (0.0001 to 0.001 cm1) for the line posi-
tions and 6 (2–5%) for the line intensities were used in the case of
the observed bands. For predicted bands, an uncertainty code 3
(0.001 to 0.01 cm1) for the line positions and 4 (10–20%) for the
line intensities were adopted. For the JPL line positions, the un-
certainty code 5 (0.00001 to 0.0001 cm1) was used.
The labeling V1 V2 V3 V4 ℓ4 ℓ5 J ε of the ro-vibrational states has
been used in the list; see Jacquemart et al. [397] for details.
In addition, it was discovered that the Q-branch in the
ν2þ2ν4þν5 band near 2.58 mm was missing from the database. It is
now provided based on the model of Lyulin and Perevalov [395].
In our effort to expand the database to spectral line parameters
relevant to the study of planetary atmospheres, we have compiled
semi-empirical parameter sets of C2H2 broadened and shifted by
the pressure of H2, He and CO2 together with the corresponding
temperature dependence of the linewidth. This update was de-
scribed in detail in Wilzewski et al. [4]. These new parameters
were constructed from Refs. [257,399–402] for H2, Refs. [403,404]
for He and Refs. [405,406] for CO2.
Further studies of these line-shape parameters are important to
improve our current update. This is especially true for the C2H2–
CO2 system, where almost no shift parameters and no tempera-
ture-dependence values have been reported in the literature to
this point.
We note a recent study by Lyulin and Campargue [407] where
empirical line lists for some of the NIR bands of acetylene are
provided. These will be considered for future updates of HITRAN.

2.27. C2H6 (molecule 27)
Ethane (C2H6) is the second most abundant hydrocarbon after
CH4 in the stratospheres of the outer planets (see for instance Ref.
[408]) and Titan [409]. It therefore plays an important role as a
tracer of atmospheric chemistry and dynamics. C2H6 is a direct
product of CH4 photochemistry and is a key constituent in pho-
tochemical modeling. In addition to the ν9 fundamental of ethane,
which is the strongest band seen in Titan observed in the 10-mm
terrestrial
window, the weak v4
torsional
band
at
∼35 mm
(289 cm1) has been detected on Titan by Cassini/CIRS [410]. Al-
though the torsional band is not infrared active in the lowest order
and hence very weak in a laboratory setting, the features near 35
mm are seen relatively strong in the Cassini/CIRS spectrum of Titan.
This new development in the far-infrared enables astronomers to
probe the lower altitudes of Titan's atmosphere.
2.27.1.
12C2H6
Since the last update in HITRAN2012 [1] for 12C2H6 at 12 mm
reported by Devi et al. [411,412] and at 7 mm reported by di Lauro
et al. [413], signiﬁcant progress has been made for ethane in the
far- and mid-infrared regions. Moazzen-Ahmadi et al. [414] stu-
died the features in the 35-mm region both in laboratory mea-
surements and theoretical modeling, which included the torsional
fundamental v4, and the ﬁrst torsional hot band, 2v4-v4, of 12C2H6
and the Q-branch of the 13CH3
12CH3 v6 band. Multiple sets of pure
ethane spectra were obtained at cold temperatures down to 166 K
at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory using a multipass absorption cell
with 52-m path length. Starting with the earlier global analyses of
ethane considering inter-vibrational interactions among the tor-
sional levels of ν3, ν9, 3ν4 bands [415], the observed spectra were ﬁt
by adjusting independent dipole constants and the same value for
self-broadening parameter for every transition. The observed
spectra were reproduced to the residuals of 1% (the reader is re-
ferred to Fig. 1 in Ref. [415]).
It was found that the modeling of the transition intensities
required an expansion of the dipole moment operator to higher
order;
this
introduced
Herman-Wallis
like
terms.
The
line
positions and line intensities of the torsional band (v4) of 12C2H6 at
35 mm reported by Moazzen-Ahmadi et al. [414] have been adop-
ted in this update. The uncertainties for line positions are set to no
better than 0.0003 cm1 (HITRAN code ¼ 4), while those of the
line intensities are conservatively set to be 5 to 10% (HITRAN code
¼ 5). For the pressure-broadened widths of the torsional band (v4)
at 35 mm, it should be noted that self- and N2-broadened widths
are listed in this version, for which we adopted the values calcu-
lated by using the linear expressions for ν9 transitions reported by
Devi et al. [411,412], similar to what was done for C2H6 in the 7-mm
region in HITRAN2008 [198]. The uncertainties for widths are
conservatively set to 10-20% (HITRAN code ¼ 4). The uncertainties
for the temperature dependence exponents of the widths are
thought to be 10-25% (HITRAN code ¼ 3).
In the near future two minor isotopologues of ethane could be
updated in the 12 mm region; one is for the 13C singly-enriched v12
band of ethane (13CH3
12CH3) at 12.2 mm measured by Devi et al.
[416] and the other for the singly-deuterated ethane (C2H5D) at
12.5 mm studied by Daly et al. [417]. In particular, new studies were
reported for 13CH3
12CH3 in the v12 band in the 12 mm region by
Devi et al. [416] and in the 7 mm region by di Lauro et al. [418] for
the v4, v9, v10 and v6 þ v11 bands between 1345 and 1557 cm1.
Their intensities were reported at 130 K with partially completed
theoretical modeling.
2.28. PH3 (molecule 28)
Phosphine (PH3) is a molecule of interest in astronomy, and its
features have long been observed and identiﬁed in the spectra of
Jupiter and Saturn (e.g. Refs. [419–422]). Because of its great im-
portance in the Earth's and other planetary atmospheres including
the interstellar medium, PH3 has been the subject of a large
number of experimental and theoretical investigations. Far infra-
red (FIR) line parameters of PH3 were included for the ﬁrst time in
the HITRAN2012 database [1]. No updates have been made for any
of the spectral line parameters for the infrared (IR) bands of
phosphine since the HITRAN2008 database [198]. After the release
of the HITRAN2012 database, there have been a few experimental
Fig. 23. Comparison of experimental PNNL absorbance cross-sections [314] of PH3 in the dyad and pentad ranges (in black) with variational calculations Rey et al. [205]

and theoretical studies reported on phosphine [423–426]. Sousa-
Silva et al. [423,424] generated a line list for phosphine; their room
temperature line list consists of 137 million transitions among the
5.6 million energy levels for the ro-vibrational states up to Jmax ¼
31 and energies up to 8000 cm1. It was augmented by a more
extensive and more accurate “hot” line list capable of simulating
observed spectra from astronomical bodies at higher temperatures
(e.g. 1500 K). In the near infrared region that is important for re-
mote sensing of the outer planets, especially Jupiter and Saturn,
the two most extensive and comprehensive experimental mea-
surements of phosphine to date include: (1) the line positions and
intensities for the ﬁve bands (2ν2, ν2þ ν4, 2ν4, ν1 and the ν3) in the
pentad region between 1950 and 2450 cm1 [426] and (2) the
measurements of spectral line-shape parameters (e.g., pressure-
broadened half widths, pressure shifts, and collisional line mixing
coefﬁcients) for the ν2þ ν4, 2ν4, ν1 and the ν3 bands [425].
The measurements reported in Ref. [426] show an increase in
the number of individual ﬁtted intensities for the fundamental
bands ν1 and ν3 from 20 and 50 reported in the previous laboratory
measurements of Tarrago et al. [2.2.28.11] to 184 and 409, re-
spectively. The actual number of measured intensities in these
bands were 337 and 829, respectively; however only the best se-
lected lines were used in the determination of the pentad band
strength. Positions and intensities for more than 4000 individual
transitions in the pentad were retrieved from analyses of the FTS
spectra recorded at the National Solar Observatory (NSO) on Kitt
Peak, and the PNNL spectra [314]. The results published in Refs.
[425,426] included 53 AþA- doublet components that are split by
the Coriolis interaction between the ν1 and ν3 bands, and nearly
150 vibrationally-mixed perturbation-allowed transitions. The
predicted spectrum from the analysis, however, did not reproduce
the experimental spectrum fully because the precisions of the
measurements were better than the calculations (for example see
Fig. 9 from Ref. [426]). To improve the calculations, a global vi-
brational and intensity analysis combining the pentad measure-
ments [425,426] with data in the dyad and the octad regions
should be undertaken.
It appears that the SAlTY line list from the recent ab initio
calculations [424] is in much better agreement with Ref. [426]
than with the HITRAN2012 data. Figure 22 shows a comparison of
the SAlTY line list [424] with the phosphine data from HI-
TRAN2012 [1] at room temperature; also shown are the recent
results of Malathy Devi et al. [426].
Recently, Nikitin et al. [427] have reported theoretical predic-
tions of phosphine spectra based on ab initio dipole moment [428]
and potential energy surfaces [429]. These calculations permitted
a qualitatively correct agreement with observed data up to the
octad range (2733–3660 cm1). An example of the comparison
between these ab initio and experimental PNNL spectra [314] is
given in Fig. 23. The theoretical approach to these variational
calculations is described in Rey et al. [430] and the corresponding
line list and ab initio cross-sections in the range (0-7000 cm1) is
available in the TheoReTS database [205].
The ab initio calculations described above (especially line po-
sitions) may not be of sufﬁcient quality to model room-tempera-
ture high resolution spectra to the HITRAN standard of accuracy.
However, they are very helpful in assigning experimental spectra
and invaluable in high-temperature simulations and will be con-
sidered for inclusion in a future edition of the HITEMP database
[278].
The theoretical background and the set of programs used for
both the energy and intensity ﬁttings in the analysis of Malathy
Devi et al. are described in Ref. [426]. Along with the positions and
intensities, line-shape parameters were measured for a large
number of transitions (over 840 Lorentz self-broadened half width
coefﬁcients, 620 self-shift coefﬁcients, 185 speed dependence
parameters, and collisional line-mixing parameters for 10 AþA-
doublet transitions) in the 2ν4, ν1 and ν3 bands, and those mea-
surements are reported in a separate article [425]. As mentioned
in the analysis of positions and intensities [426], the parameters in
the pentad region are important for the exploration of chemistry
and dynamics on Saturn using the existing Cassini/VIMS ob-
servations. The results reported in Refs. [425,426] (which have
appropriate supplementary materials) are applicable to a variety of
remote-sensing studies including the analyses of the near infrared
data of Jupiter from the Juno mission and ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons
Explorer (JUICE).
Creation of a line list of PH3 in the pentad and octad regions is
in progress and is expected to be available as an update to the
HITRAN2016 database.

2.31. H2S (molecule 31)
Line positions for 654 transitions in the (010)–(000) band were
updated using experimental upper- state energy levels for H2
32S,
H2
33S, and H2
34S isotopologues reported in Ulenikov et al. [431].
while the lower-state energy levels were calculated using the ro-
tational constants of Flaud et al. [432]. It appeared that the band
center of this band was off by about 0.002 cm1 in HITRAN2012
while some higher-J rotational transitions were off by up to
∼0.055 cm1.
In the triad region it was found that values for different para-
meters for some of the lines were not transferred correctly from
Ref. [433] to HITRAN2000 [434]. This issue remained all the way
through HITRAN2012, but has been ﬁxed for HITRAN2016.
Intensity distribution of some of the multiplets in the NIR re-
gion was found to be inaccurate in the previous version in HITRAN
for many lines where the experimental intensity for the entire
multiplet were given to every component in the multiplet, rather
than the intensity being divided between components. This is
ﬁxed in HITRAN2016.
The air-broadening coefﬁcients of hydrogen sulﬁde (H2S) in the
HITRAN database were set to a constant value, γair¼ 0.0740 cm1
atm1 at 296 K, for most of the transitions (since HITRAN2004 [3])
based on the average value of available experimental data while
just a few half widths were based on experimental values. For
HITRAN2016, a thorough survey of measurements of both the air-
broadening and self-broadening coefﬁcients of H2S has been made
[435–438]. The report by Tan et al. [439] describes the results in
more detail. In brief, a slow decrease of the air-(and self-) broad-
ening coefﬁcients with increasing ( J
00 þ 0.2Ka
00) lower-state quan-
tum number combination can be seen in Fig. 24. The vibrational
dependence of the broadening parameters is neglected and we use
the semi-empirical method based on the linear ﬁt to the available
experimental data to compute both air- and self-broadening

coefﬁcients of H2S for all the isotopologues. This linear ap-
proaching value could only be used within the range probed by
experiments. So for lower-state rotational quantum number J
00 o
12, the error code was set to 4 (between 10 and 20%) for both self-
and air-broadening coefﬁcients; for 12 r J
00 r 18, the error code
was set to 3 (> 20%); and for J
00> 18, the value of both self- and air-
broadening coefﬁcients was set to the linear ﬁt value corre-
sponding to J
00 ¼ 18, and the error code was 2 (estimate).
2.32. HCOOH (molecule 32)
Unchanged.
2.33. HO2 (molecule 33)
The air-broadening coefﬁcients of the hydroperoxyl radical had
not been modiﬁed since HITRAN2004 [3] in which they were set to
a constant, γair¼ 0.107 cm1/atm (based on the measurement in
Ref. [442]). In the meantime, a number of different measurements
of γair have been performed using infrared and submillimeter-wave
spectra [442–447]. These measurements indicate a small vibra-
tional dependence and a slow linear dependence with rotational
quanta for γair.
The following approach was chosen for the air-broadening
values in HITRAN2016. Experimental values were used wherever
available for all the transitions with the corresponding rotational
quantum numbers (in all the bands). For all other lines, a linear
extrapolation with ( J″ þ 0.2Ka″) o 17 was used:

For all transitions with ( J″ þ 0.2Ka″) > 17, the value corre-
sponding to the experimental value with the largest ( J″ þ 0.2Ka″)
was used. More details on the aforementioned algorithm are given
in the report by Tan et al. [448].
For the self-broadening, a default estimate value of 0.3 cm1/
atm was assigned to all transitions.
2.34. O (“molecule” 34)
The values of line positions and lower-state energies for the O
atom have been reverted to those given in the HITRAN1996-2000
editions [434,449]. They originate from Zink et al. [450]. The HI-
TRAN2004 to 2012 editions used outdated values from the older
version of the JPL catalogue [451] (downloaded in 2004), although
the reference code mistakenly pointed to the work of Zink et al.
The values have since been ﬁxed in the JPL catalogue [451]
(downloaded in 2015), and consequently we reverted back to the
more accurate values of Zink et al. [450].
2.35. ClONO2 (molecule 35)
Unchanged.
2.36. NOþ (molecule 36)
The fundamental band of the NOþ molecule (in ground-elec-
tronic state 1Σþ) as well as its hot bands were introduced into the
HITRAN1996 edition [449] and updated in 2008 [198]. As pointed
out by López-Puertas et al. [452] and references therein, the mo-
lecule is an important constituent of Earth's ionosphere. Ref. [452]
actually used atmospheric observations to determine transition
frequencies of its fundamental band and the associated hot band.
The identiﬁcation of NOþ in the terrestrial atmosphere by rota-
tional spectroscopy should be possible. In addition, NOþ was re-
cently identiﬁed tentatively in the interstellar medium [453].
The new edition of HITRAN adds the previously omitted pure-
rotation transitions. The current prediction of the rotational
spectrum corresponds to the recently created version 2 of the
CDMS [454]. The data are based on a ﬁt to rotational data [455] as
well as ro-vibrational data [452,456]. The dipole moment of 0.380
D is from a quantum-chemical calculation [457].
The ground state rotational data extend to the J ¼ 8–7 transi-
tion near 32 cm–1. Therefore, predictions should be reliable to at
least up to 70 cm–1. The entry now also contains predictions of
rotational transitions in v ¼ 1; these are more uncertain than
those in v ¼ 0.
2.37. HOBr (molecule 37)
Unchanged.
2.38. C2H4 (molecule 38)
Ethylene, C2H4, is both a naturally-occurring compound and a
tropospheric pollutant on the Earth [458]. It is also present as a by-
product of methane photochemistry in the atmosphere of outer
solar system bodies including Saturn [459] and Titan [409]. Optical
remote sensing of ethylene in planetary atmospheres often relies
on the strongest band observed in the 10-mm spectral region,
namely the ν7 fundamental of the main isotopologue [460]. The
extensive work carried out in this range of the ro-vibration spec-
trum of 12C2H4 was recently reviewed by Alkadrou et al. [461]. The
data available in HITRAN2012 for the 10-mm region corresponds to
the infrared active ν10, ν7 and ν12 bands of 12C2H4, and the infrared
and Raman inactive ν4 band of the same isotopologue, located near
826, 949, 1442 and 1026 cm–1, respectively. The information for
the ν10, ν7 and ν4 bands dates back to the 2000 edition of HITRAN
[434]. It was generated relying on the frequency analysis of Will-
aert et al. [462], Cauuet et al. [463], Legrand et al. [464] and Ru-
sinek et al. [465], and intensities measured for 13 lines of the ν7
band observed in the range 940–970 cm–1 [466]. Spectroscopic
information obtained for the ν12 band by Rotger et al. [467] was
added in the 2008 edition [198].
A global frequency and intensity analysis of the 10-mm ν10/ν7/ν4/
ν12 band system of 12C2H4 was very recently carried out using the
tensorial formalism developed in Dijon for X2Y4 asymmetric-top
molecules and including the Coriolis interactions affecting the
upper vibrational levels 101, 71, 41 and 121 [461]. Relying on
spectroscopic information available in the literature or speciﬁcally
retrieved from high-resolution Fourier transform infrared spectra,
a total of 10,757 line positions and 1645 line intensities were as-
signed and ﬁtted with global root mean square deviations of
2.6  10–4 cm–1 and 2.5%, respectively. Using the results of that
work and information available in the literature, a HITRAN-for-
matted list of parameters for 65,776 lines belonging to the ν10, ν7,
ν4 and ν12 bands of 12C2H4 and covering the 620–1525 cm–1 range
was generated [461]. Comparisons of experimental spectra with
spectra calculated for the same physical conditions with this line
list and HITRAN 2012 are presented in Figs. 5 to 7 of Ref. [461].
They show that the modeling provided by this line list is sig-
niﬁcantly better than HITRAN 2012 for the ν10 band, comparable
for the ν7 band (and for the ν4 band hidden beneath it), and
slightly worse for the ν12 band.
In the line list of Ref. [461], the vibration-rotation levels are
assigned using the traditional (J, Ka, Kc) labels, where J is the
quantum number associated with the total angular momentum of
the molecule, and Ka and Kc are associated with its projections
along the molecular symmetry axes corresponding to the limiting
prolate and oblate symmetric top approximations. As the tensorial
formalism characterizes these levels using (J, C, α) labels (C is the
ro-vibrational symmetry in the D2h group, and α is a ranking

number used to sort the energy levels within a (J, C) block), a
“translation” had to be carried out when generating the line list. It
was very recently found that Ka and Kc labels were incorrect for a
number of heavily-mixed rotational levels of the 101, 71 and 41
upper vibrational levels. A corrected line list was therefore gen-
erated and submitted for publication [468].
The spectroscopic information available in HITRAN for the 10-
mm region of 12C2H4 has been updated in the following way. Data
for the ν10, ν7 and ν4 bands were taken from the corrected line list
of Alkadrou et al. [468]; however, lines having intensity smaller
than 10–30 cm–1/(molecule cm–2) at 296 K were ignored. The line
positions are given a HITRAN error code of 4 or 0 (0.0001–
0.001 cm1 and larger than 1 cm1 respectively) depending on
whether the corresponding J″ and Ka″ values are or are not in the
ranges included in the frequency analysis of Ref. [461]. Similarly,
an error code of 5 (5–10%) characterizes the intensities of lines in
the ν10 and ν7 bands corresponding to transitions involving J″ and
Ka″ values in the ranges included in the intensity analysis of Ref.
[461]. The error code is set to 0 for all other line intensities. Note
that errors in the degeneracies provided for the rotational levels in
the 101 and 71 vibrational levels in the line lists of Refs. [461] and
[468] are corrected here. Data for the ν12 band was taken from
HITRAN2012; however, 187 lines having an intensity smaller than
10–30 cm–1/(molecule cm–2) at 296 K have been excluded, to be
consistent with the information provided for the three other
bands. For all the lines, the self-broadening coefﬁcients were cal-
culated using the empirical expressions reported in Ref. [460], the
air-broadening coefﬁcients were generated as described in [467],
and the temperature dependence exponent n was set to 0.76,
determined as described in Ref. [461].
The consistency of the C2H4 analyses that served for the updated
line list has been conﬁrmed by extensive variational calculations [469]
based on ab initio potential energy [470] and dipole moment surfaces
[471]. This sort of qualitative band-shape validation was found to be
particularly important for modeling complicated intensity perturba-
tions involving “dark” states and for checking for possible contributions
of hot bands. The corresponding variational methods are described by
Rey et al. [469], and the results of ab initio based calculations including
cold and hot bands in the range 0–6000 cm1 can be found in the
TheoReTS database [205]. These calculations agree well with the new
HITRAN2016 line list and experimental PNNL spectra [314] in the 10-
mm region.
New bands of 12C13CH4 are included in the new version of the
database. More precisely, the new parameters which were derived
from high-resolution Fourier transform spectra are those of the
ν10, ν8, ν7, ν4, ν6 bands, which absorb in the 615–1339 cm1 spectral
region [472,473]. Their accuracy can be estimated to be of the
order of 0.6  103 cm1 for the positions [473] and 4% for the
intensities [472]. The broadening parameters were determined in
the same fashion as for the principal isotopologue described
above.
Fig. 25 (generated using HAPI described in Section 6) shows
that the HITRAN2016 ethylene line list models experimental
spectra from PNNL [314] much better than HITRAN2012.
2.39. CH3OH (molecule 39)
It was found that lower-state energies in the IR spectra of
methanol introduced in HITRAN2004 [3] do not follow HITRAN
formalism in that the lowest allowed energy level should be equal
to zero. Yet the convention was observed in the MW region. The
lowest energy in the IR spectra was 128.1069 cm1 instead of zero.
This has been ﬁxed now to follow the usual convention.

HITRAN2016 update.

2.40. CH3Br (molecule 40)
Unchanged.
2.41. CH3CN (molecule 41)
Methyl cyanide, also known as acetonitrile or cyanomethane, a
trace species in the terrestrial atmosphere [474], has also been
seen in comets [475] and in the atmosphere of Titan [476], and is
an important species in various environments of the interstellar
medium. Müller et al. [479] provided a brief overview as well as
appropriate references. The ν4 band of methyl cyanide was in-
troduced into HITRAN2008 [198]. The data were based on a mul-
tispectrum analysis of this band and a preliminary modeling of the
positions and intensities [477,478]. The ν4 band is actually the
third lowest wavelength band, with ν8 and 2ν8 being at longer
wavelengths. The prospects of detecting transitions of ν8 or 2ν8
with the James-Webb Space Telescope or other instruments in
space or in Earth's atmosphere are uncertain. The data are thought
to be important for the excitation or de-excitation of the v ¼ 0
transitions or of bands with much greater intensity, such as ν6.
The following update is planned in the immediate future, fol-
lowing the HITRAN2016 release. The current line position and
intensity predictions for ν8, 2ν8, and 2ν8–ν8 are from the CDMS
[454]; the entries are actually combined CDMS and JPL entries. The
predictions are based on a combined ﬁt of rotational and ro-vi-
brational data involving states up to v8 ¼ 2 that was published by
Müller et al. [479]. The analysis takes into account interactions
among these states as well as interactions of v8 ¼ 2 with v4 ¼ 1, v7
¼ 1, and v8 ¼ 3 and of the last three states among each other.
The ν8 transition frequencies were taken from Koivusaari [480],
and the 2ν8 transition frequencies were from Müller et al. [479].
Most of the v8 ¼ 1 and 2 rotational data as well as some v ¼ 0 data
are also from Müller et al. [479]. Most of the additional ground-
state data were published by Cazzoli and Puzzarini [481] and by
Müller et al. [482]. Information of the K level structure in the
ground vibrational state is based on Anttila et al. [483] and on the
perturbations treated in Ref. [479]. Additional v8 ¼ 1 and 2 data
were published by Bauer et al. [484]. Parameters describing the
three states around 10 mm were taken mostly from the study of
Tolonen at al. [485].
The transition dipole moments were evaluated by Müller at al.
[479] as were line broadening and shifting parameters which were
transferred from the ν4 band [477]. The predictions should be re-
liable throughout, but slight caution is recommended for the
highest K transitions of 2ν8 (K ¼ 13 and 14).
Assignments for the ν4 band are probably complete as far as the
available spectral recordings are concerned. However, the pre-
liminary analysis in Ref. [478], together with data from Ref. [479],
affected the ground-state parameters substantially such that a
new modeling effort will be necessary. The analysis should be
completed well before the next HITRAN update, and further data
may be available as well.
2.42. CF4 (molecule 42)
Carbon tetraﬂuoride, CF4, is a greenhouse gas with a huge
global warming potential. Up to now, only the ν3 fundamental
band was present in HITRAN. However, this band represents only
about 65% of the absorption intensity at room temperature due to
the presence of hot bands.
A new global ﬁt of all CF4 assigned lines involving the ν2, ν3 and
ν4 modes, as well as a separate one consisting of the ν1 mode have
been performed, including some new experimental data which
was recently recorded in the Groupe de Spectrométrie Moléculaire
et Atmosphérique, Université de Reims-Champagne-Ardenne. This
study [486] will be published soon. It has resulted in new reliable
effective Hamiltonian parameters for 12CF4, which, in turn, allow
an improved calculation of the ν4 and ν3 fundamental bands and,
also and for the ﬁrst time, of the ν3þν2- ν2 hot band which re-
presents about 17 % of the absorption intensity in this region at
room temperature. The dipole moment parameters have also been
corrected. This will be explained in detail in Ref. [486]. Thus, the
present update completely replaces the previous data and includes
the ν4, ν3 and ν3þν2- ν2 bands.
Fig. 26 shows a comparison between an experimental spectrum
from the Rennes group [487] and the calculation constituting the
HITRAN2016 update.
2.43. C4H2 (molecule 43)
The ν9 band region (around 220 cm1) and the ν8 band region
(around 650 cm1) of diacetylene, C4H2, is important in inter-
preting Titan [488] observations. The ν9 band region has been
completely replaced with a new line list derived from a combined
analysis presented in Refs. [488,489]. The updated line list pro-
vides new intensity for the lines already existing in the database
but also includes numerous hot bands. The ν8 band region was
updated by scaling the intensities of all the lines in that region by a
factor of 0.8 based on the recommendation given in Jolly et al.
[489]. Finally, the ν6þν8 region (around 1200 cm1) was in-
troduced into HITRAN for the ﬁrst time based on the predictions
from the global analyses. This band is important in astrophysics as
it has been observed in the atmosphere of Titan and the pre-
planetary nebula SMP LMC 11 with the Spitzer Infrared Spectro-
graph [490].
2.44. HC3N (molecule 44)
Unchanged.
2.45. H2 (molecule 45)
Molecular hydrogen (H2) is the most abundant gas in the at-
mosphere of gaseous giants. It was ﬁrst introduced in HITRAN2012
[1]. The line list covered the quadrupole-allowed transitions for
the H2 isotopologue and dipole-allowed transitions for HD in their
ground electronic states.
An update was made for singly-deuterated molecular hydrogen
(HD) shortly after the release of the HITRAN2012 database. It was
discovered by J. Mendrok (Lulea University of Technology, Kiruna,
Sweden) that the abundance of the HD molecule was incorrectly
calculated in the original release of HITRAN2012; this issue has
now been ﬁxed. The implication was that the intensities of the
electric dipole transitions originally reported needed to be multi-
plied by a factor of two, although it did not affect the Einstein-A
coefﬁcients.
In addition, a total of 7195 electric quadrupole transitions of the
HD molecule have been calculated and added to the HITRAN line
list. The calculation was carried out using the energy levels from
the work by Pachucki and Komasa [491] and the quadrupole
moment function of Wolniewicz et al. [492].
In HITRAN2016, 527 transitions of H2 that correspond to high
vibrational overtones were removed. This was because there were
numerical issues in calculating the intensities of these transitions.
Refs. [340,341] explain how the use of double precision in calcu-
lating overtone intensities may lead to numerical errors and that
quadruple precision is needed.
Only a default value of the broadening parameter for the Voigt
proﬁle was given (the same for all the lines) in HITRAN2012. In
HITRAN2016, a complete dataset of the line-shape parameters for
the Hartmann-Tran proﬁle is provided for self-perturbed H2 [6].

This dataset was determined from the analysis of H2 experimental
spectra. According to the new recommendation adopted in HI-
TRAN, these line-shape parameters are stored separately for four
different temperature ranges, see Ref. [6]. For the lines and con-
ditions for which experimental spectra are not available, the line-
shape parameters were extrapolated. In the near future we plan to
extend HITRAN with the HT line-shape parameters for H2 per-
turbed by helium, which will be based on experimentally vali-
dated ab initio calculations [493].
2.46. CS (molecule 46)
Unchanged.
2.47. SO3 (molecule 47)
Sulfur trioxide (SO3) occurs naturally in volcanic emissions and
hot springs [494]. It is also a pollutant emitted by smoke stacks
and other industrial exhausts [495]. In the terrestrial atmosphere,
SO3 rapidly forms sulfuric acid with its association with acid rain.
SO3 is a constituent in the atmosphere of Venus [496]. Recently,
Zhang et al. [497] have indicated that measurements of the
abundances of SO3 in the lower thermosphere of Venus can an-
swer important questions related to sulfur chemistry. The spec-
troscopic study of sulfur oxides can also provide insight into the
history of the Earth's atmosphere [498] and hence modeling of
Earth-like planets.
SO3 was included for the ﬁrst time in the 2012 HITRAN edition.
This entry was based on the experimental data of Maki and co-
workers [499–502] with relative transition intensities scaled by
the absolute values computed ab initio by Underwood et al. [503].
Also included were 25 pure-rotation transitions observed by
Meyer et al. [504] for which the ab initio intensities of Underwood
et al. [503] were used.
SO3 is a planar, non-polar molecule but with sufﬁcient rotational
excitation that the molecule can distort and undergo pure-rota-
tional transitions. A hybrid, empirical ab initio rotational line list for
32S16O3 has been constructed for this edition of the database. For
this, the ground-state rotational constants and centrifugal distortion
parameters were taken from the ﬁts to their infrared spectrum gi-
ven by Ref. [502]; these were used to generate a set of vibrational
ground-state rotational energies for J up to 85. To ensure that the
extrapolation to high-J states is reasonable, a comparison was made
between these energy levels and those calculated variationally by
Ref. [505]; very good agreement was found with a root-mean-
square difference of only 0.0167 cm1 for all rotational transitions
involving states with J up to 85. Intensities (and Einstein-A coefﬁ-
cients) were determined using the variational calculations and an
ab initio dipole moment surface [503]. The result is a list of 3414
pure-rotational transitions for 32S16O3 which have been added to
the 25 microwave transitions previously included. No measure-
ments or calculations for the line-shape parameters are available;
therefore the usual default values were chosen.
Recently Underwood et al. [506] presented a combined theo-
retical study of the spectrum of hot 32S16O3. This paper provided
an extensive new line list with 21 billion lines for hot 32S16O3 but
no new line measurements. However, comparisons between this
line list and the infrared absorption measurements suggest that
the calculations overestimate the infrared line intensities by about
30%. Interestingly, this difference appears to be rather uniform.
Some direct measurement of the 32S16O3 infrared line intensities
would be welcome to inform future updates of the database.
2.48. C2N2 (molecule 48)
Cyanogen is present in the atmosphere of Titan [507]. Its line
list is now included into HITRAN for the ﬁrst time based on the
work of Fayt et al. [508]. The line list is for the ν5 band system
around 234 cm1.
2.49. COCl2 (molecule 49)
Phosgene is a long-lived, highly toxic synthetic gas that is
widely used in pharmaceutical and polymer industries. Phosgene
is a serious health hazard and was, in fact, used as a chemical
weapon during World War I [509]. In addition, it has a strong
greenhouse potential [510]. This molecule was detected in the
atmosphere using solar occultation spectrometry [511], and using
ACE-FTS [510] and MIPAS [512] retrievals.
Phosgene is a heavy molecule with small rotational constants
and with a number of low-lying vibrational states. As a con-
sequence, in order to perform a detailed and extensive analysis of
its absorption region it is necessary to record spectra at low
temperature. The analysis of the 11.75-mm spectral region of
phosgene (which is now in HITRAN2016) was performed using a
high-resolution Fourier transform spectrum recorded at 169 K
[513]. The ν5 bands of the two isotopologues CO35Cl2 and
CO35Cl37Cl were assigned up to very high quantum numbers and
the corresponding upper-state ro-vibrational levels were ﬁtted to
within the experimental accuracy (∼0.0002 cm1) [513]. On the
other hand, it was not possible to assign the corresponding hot
bands, which were modeled using extrapolated Hamiltonian

constants. As a consequence, their line positions are not accurate.
As far as the line intensities are concerned, they were calculated
[512] using single transition moments calibrated using the cross-
section measurements from Sharpe et al. [314]. Their accuracy is
estimated to be on the order of 5%.
3. Absorption cross-sections
Apart from the line-by-line spectroscopic absorption para-
meters discussed in Section 2, the HITRAN database contains in-
formation on absorption cross-sections where the line-by-line
parameters are absent or incomplete. Usually this takes place for
heavy polyatomic molecules (with low-lying vibrational modes)
which are difﬁcult for detailed analysis due to the high density of
the spectral bands/lines, broadening effects, isomerization, and
overall modeling complexity. Knowledge of the spectroscopy of
these molecules is important for many purposes, including at-
mospheric remote sensing, radiative forcing calculations, detection
of biomass burning, detection of toxic industrial chemicals (TICs),
climate change monitoring, modeling planetary atmospheres,
spectral calibration, etc. In fact these cross-sections have been
applied in radiative-transfer codes in good approximations to the
full-blown simulations that are possible with the line-by-line
parameters [514–518]. It is therefore important to provide these
cross-sections in HITRAN covering wide spectral ranges and at
diverse thermodynamic conditions.
The cross-section ﬁles are provided in the HITRAN format de-
scribed in Ref. [449] and are further described on the ofﬁcial HI-
TRAN website (http://hitran.org/docs/cross-sections-deﬁnitions/).
Each cross-section is given in a separate ﬁle with a header con-
taining molecule name, chemical formula, wavenumber range,
temperature, pressure, broadener, resolution of the experiment,
and source. The ﬁle is completed with the value of each cross-
section at equal intervals within the range, given in units of
cm2molecule1. The cross-sections come from high-resolution
laboratory observations, predominantly from Fourier transform
spectrometers. Some of these measurements include small nega-
tive values, which for the HITRAN-formatted cross-sections were
substituted by zeroes; in these cases we provide all the original
cross-sections in a supplementary “Alternate” folder, because the
negative values provide the user with some information about the
noise level in the measurements.
The HITRAN2012 edition of the database contained cross-sec-
tions for about ﬁfty gases. For the HITRAN2016 edition we have
increased the amount of gases almost six fold by adding new data
in the infrared spectral range. A dedicated paper detailing this
update will be published separately. Here we only provide a brief
summary and overview tables. Around 220 molecules of atmo-
spheric, industrial, and remote sensing interests were taken from
the quantitative spectroscopy PNNL (Paciﬁc Northwest National
Laboratory) database, described in Sharpe et al. [314]. This com-
pilation was updated with 55 molecules from more recent work of
Johnson et al. [519]. Twelve of these 55 molcules are new to PNNL.
Spectra for these molecules will be indispensable, particularly for
biomass burning detection. The PNNL database contains calibra-
tion-quality composite spectra given at atmospheric pressure and
three temperatures (5 °C, 25 °C, and 50 °C). All these cross-sections
were measured using the FT-IR technique with 0.112 cm1 spectral
resolution on a Bruker IFS 66v/S spectrometer.
In addition, a large portion of new molecules of atmospheric
interest was taken from the 2013 review by Hodnebrog et al. [520].
The data presented in this review are more varied than PNNL
considering spectral resolution, while containing all the strong
spectral features important in radiative forcing calculations (on
Earth). The subset of air and nitrogen broadened cross-sections
from this review is for 700–750 Torr pressure range and room
temperature. Some lower-temperature data for 253 K from High-
wood and Shine [521] were also included into HITRAN2016. Fi-
nally, more recently measured data were taken from Wagner and
Birk for BrONO2 [522], Harrison et al. for CFC-12 [523], HCFC-22
[524], CCl4 [525], HFC-23 [526], HFC-134a [527], Reed and Hodges
(2015) for ethane [528], as well as newly measured and revised
data for many molecules from Refs. [529–540].
The summary on the new and updated compounds divided by
categories is presented in Table 9. These categories are im-
plemented in HITRANonline for the convenience of users to browse
the data. This summary does not include those compounds that

were not updated. For instance, there are no new UV cross-sec-
tions that were added; therefore molecules that had only UV
cross-sections in HITRAN2012 are not included in this table.
In Fig. 27 we show an example of the update for the acet-
aldehyde molecule (CH3CHO). The new data were taken from the
PNNL database [314], while the data from HITRAN2012 were ori-
ginally from Tereszchuk and Bernath [541]. Sixteen cross-section
temperature-pressure sets from Ref. [541] are presented in HI-
TRAN2012 in the 2400–3400 cm1 spectral range. These cross-
sections were calibrated using the PNNL data [541] and thus are in
a good agreement with the update, in particular for absorption
between 6.0  1021 and 1.0  1019 cm2 molecule1. For this
molecule, the new update extends the temperature range up to
323 K and the wavenumber range from 510 to 6500 cm1. The
update includes stronger features in the mid-infrared which were
absent in HITRAN2012. The data from Ref. [541] are also retained
in the new HITRAN release.
In Table 10 the updates to the cross-sections of the molecules
already existing in HITRAN2012 are presented. High-quality data
were taken from different sources for the ranges which were ei-
ther absent or covered insufﬁciently. Updates for molecules that
were not previously in HITRAN are presented in Table 11. In both
Table 10 and Table 11 we give total ranges for the wavenumber,
pressure, temperature, and resolution. Each line in both of the
tables
summarizes
all
updated
cross-sections
for
the
given
molecule, including those relegated to the alternate folder. If the
broadener is not provided, self-broadening is assumed. Both tables
contain total pressure of the sample including the buffer gas
(where applicable).
While the extent of the update of the cross-sectional part of the
database is impressive, this section of the database is by no means
complete. In the future we plan further revision of high-quality
data that become available in the literature and by the facilitation
of new experiments. In the near future we also plan to extend the
database to include planetary-relevant cross-sections that recently
became available, including those given in Refs. [548–552]. An
extensive update of the UV cross-sections is also planned.
4. Collision-induced absorption
Collision-induced absorption (CIA) was ﬁrst introduced into
HITRAN in the 2012 edition and was largely based on the data
collected in Richard et al. [586]. This section of the database is
accessible through (www.hitran.org/cia). CIA refers to absorption
by transient electric dipoles induced by the interaction between
colliding molecules. Due to the short life-time of collision com-
plexes, this typically leads to broad absorption features underlying
the much sharper lines due to absorption by isolated molecules. As
CIA arises from binary collision complexes, the intensity scales
with the number densities of both the absorber and the perturber,
i.e., with the square of the pressure at constant volume mixing
ratio. To be completely explicit, the transmittance at wavenumber
ν, τabs-pert(ν), is related to the collision-induced cross section ta-
bulated in the HITRAN CIA section, kabs-pert(ν), through

where ρabs and ρpert are the number densities of the absorber and
perturber, respectively, and L is the path length. The CIA cross
sections tabulated in HITRAN are given in cm5 molecule2
throughout [586].
Often the relevant perturber will be air, i.e., a 21:79 mixture of
O2:N2 (the amount of argon in the atmosphere coupled with its
poor efﬁciency as a collisional partner makes this assumption
quite reasonable). In that case, one can either add absorber-O2 and
absorber-N2 contributions, or equivalently use the absorber-Air
ﬁles which are introduced in this version of HITRAN. In the latter
case, the perturber number density equals the air number density
given by ρpert ¼ ρAir ¼ ρO2 þ ρN2.
4.1. Molecular oxygen 1.27-mm band
The CIA data for the 1.27-mm band (corresponding to X 3Σ−
g (v
¼ 0) - a 1Δg (v ¼ 0)) of O2 have been revised in the current re-
lease of HITRAN. In this region, CIA is stronger whereas magnetic
dipole lines are weaker when compared to the oxygen A-band.
Hence, under atmospheric conditions, CIA contributes signiﬁcantly
to the absorption in the 1.27-mm band.
All data included for this transition are taken from the ex-
periment by Maté et al. [587], recorded using a Fourier transform
spectrometer. Data recorded for pure O2 can be found in the O2 
O2 ﬁle. These data have been corrected for an error in HI-
TRAN2012, which accidentally contained O2 Air spectra. Data
recorded for air mixtures of 21:79 O2:N2 can be found in the O2 
Air ﬁle, which is described above. In the previous version of HI-
TRAN, data for such mixtures could be found in the O2 N2 ﬁle,
but these have been moved to the O2 Air ﬁle to stress that these
also include O2 O2 contributions. One should not double count
the O2 O2 CIA by including both O2 O2 and O2 Air contribu-
tions in atmospheric models. This has replaced the data of Smith
Fig. 28. Raw experimental CIA data for the oxygen 1.06-mm band at T ¼ 230 K for
50:50 and 75:25 O2:N2 mixtures, and the contributions of O2 O2 and O2 N2
determined from these data. For readability in gray scale, the legend is ordered
vertically according to the peak intensity.
Fig. 29. Comparison of the real and imaginary indices of ZnS and TiO2 from 1 to 20
mm. Since particle extinction spectra in the infrared have a wavelength dependence
which is similar to the wavelength dependence of the imaginary index, the ex-
tinction spectra of ZnS and TiO2 particles will be very different.

and Newnham for this band [588]. The data previously provided in
this band for O2:N2 mixtures contained magnetic dipole lines due
to O2 monomer absorption. This issue has now been resolved, as
the monomer lines have been subtracted from the present data.
4.2. Oxygen 1.06-mm band in air
The molecular oxygen X 3Σ−
g (v ¼ 0) - a 1Δg (v ¼ 1) transition
at 1.06 mm has much weaker magnetic dipole lines than what is
observed for the 1.27-mm band, and hence the 1.06-mm band is
dominated by collision-induced absorption. The previous version
of HITRAN already contained spectra for this transition, for dif-
ferent O2:N2 mixtures, measured by Smith and Newnham [588].
These spectra have been re-analyzed by ﬁtting spectra for different
mixtures to contributions of O2 O2 and O2 N2 collisional pairs.
This is illustrated in Fig. 28, which shows two spectra, for 50:50
and 75:25 mixtures of O2:N2, both at T ¼ 230 K. These spectra can
be reproduced essentially using only the O2 O2 contribution as
shown. The contribution of O2 N2 is smaller than the error bars
and noise levels. The spectra determined in this way have lower
noise levels than direct measurements for air mixtures, where the
absorption is weaker due to the lower O2 density. These data have
been smoothed further and are now available in the O2 Air ﬁle.
4.3. Oxygen A band in air
Collision-induced absorption in the oxygen A band is also of
atmospheric interest. In spite of the smaller contribution of CIA in
this band, relative to the much stronger magnetic dipole lines, CIA
is signiﬁcant for high-accuracy measurements including airmass
calibration of the OCO-2 instrument [589]. The HITRAN CIA data-
base already contained data for O2 O2 and O2 N2 from Tran
et al. [253], valid for temperatures between 200 and 300 K. For
convenience, we now also provide the spectrum for O2 Air, ob-
tained by combining the available O2 O2 and O2 N2 data. In the
alternate folder, we now also include O2 Air data from Drouin
et al. [252] obtained in a multispectrum ﬁtting approach. Line-by-
line parameters determined in the same multispectrum ﬁt, are
also available in HITRAN2016. Consistent use of both line-by-line
and CIA data accurately reproduces the total absorption under
atmospheric conditions, and has been shown to reduce systematic
errors in atmospheric retrievals [252].
4.4. Planned update
This update represents a small revision of the HITRAN CIA
section, and we aim to extend the CIA section with recently
measured and calculated spectra in the near future. This update
will include existing and new collisional pairs. We also plan to
further update different spectral regions for molecular oxygen.
5. Aerosol refractive indices
Optical depths in the atmosphere are determined by the spatial
and temporal distributions of gases, clouds, and aerosols [590].
Clouds and aerosols also take part in chemical reactions in both
the liquid and solid phases [591]. The interpretation of remote-
sensing retrievals of gaseous species is limited frequently by how
well one can separate gaseous opacity from that of clouds and
aerosols. Knowledge of the refractive indices of the aerosols and
cloud particles and their size distributions is necessary in order to
specify their optical properties. HITRAN2016 contains refractive
indices in the visible, infrared, and millimeter spectral ranges of
many types of cloud and aerosol particles. Table 12 lists the HI-
TRAN2016 indices.
As discussed by Bohren and Huffman [633], the refractive index
m is a function of wavelength, and has a real, mreal, and imaginary,
mimag, component:

New HITRAN2016 indices include refractive indices associated
with exoplanet atmospheres. Indices (see Table 12) of materials
which condense out at temperatures from 1725 K (e.g. SiO2) to
700 K (e.g. ZnS) include most of the condensates tabulated by
Wakeford and Sing [634], who calculated transmission spectral
properties of clouds for hot-Jupiter exoplanets. Many of the indices
have been kindly provided to HITRAN2016 by Harrald Mutschke of
the Friedrich Schiller University Jena. Additional indices of mate-
rials (e.g. Mg spinels with a variety of impurities) not tabulated in
Table 12 can be downloaded from the extensive Jena web site
(http://www.astro.uni-jena.de/Laboratory/OCDB/index.html).
An
example of the new indices is presented in Fig. 29, which displays
the real and imaginary indices of ZnS and TiO2, two possible
exoplanet particle compositions.
HITRAN2016 extends the HITRAN-RI program [635] that resides
on the HITRAN website by including the exoplanet indices. HI-
TRAN-RI is written in the IDL (Interactive Design Language) and
Fortran 90 programming languages, and applies the Bohren-
Huffman [633] Mie code. The user speciﬁes in a user-edited ASCII
ﬁle the particle composition (refractive index), wavelength range,
and log-normal particle size distribution. The program then cal-
culates extinction, scattering, absorption, single scattering albedo,
asymmetry, and backscattering spectra of the cloud or aerosol
particle. Provision is provided to generate output ASCII ﬁles of the
inputs and spectra. The IDL version of HITRAN-RI provides output
postscript ﬁles. Other special program features allow the user to
compare two sets of refractive indices, and to calculate spectra for
multiple-component aerosols. As an instructional aid, test cases
can be run. PDF versions of the original reference papers are
contained in a subdirectory, while the refractive indices are stored
in subdirectories in ASCII and NetCDF formats. The user can use
the ASCII ﬁles to quickly look up the real and imaginary indices at
a speciﬁc wavelength, while the HITRAN-RI program accesses the
netCDF ﬁles. HITRAN-RI allows the user to read in user-speciﬁed
refractive indices. The source code of HITRAN-RI can also be
modiﬁed and added to by the user.
6. Global data and software
6.1. Database structure and interface (www.hitran.org)
Since June 2015, users have been able to access the HITRAN
line-by-line data not only by downloading them in the traditional
ASCII 160-character (.par) format from the ftp site, but also
through the easy-to-use interface HITRANonline, available at www.
hitran.org. Cross sections can also be accessed through this dy-
namic interface, while CIA and aerosols sections of the database
are also accessible, though so far only as static ﬁles. This new tool
(described in Hill et al. [2]) allows custom ﬁltering and selection of
molecules and their isotopologues in the wavenumber region of
interest. The default output format is still .par, but users are given
an opportunity to create their own, customized output formats,
including the HDF5 format widely used by NASA scientists. The
ﬂexibility of the formats is achieved due to the fact that the da-
tabase is cast into a relational format [236]: it is now a compilation
of tables of parameters and metadata that are interconnected and
searchable using Structured Query Language (SQL) (see Refs. [2]
and [236] for details). This new ﬂexible database format offers
many advantages over the static ﬁxed-width ASCII ﬁles. Indeed,
we have now introduced non-Voigt line shapes [6], broadening
parameters by perturbing gases other than air or self [4], and other
parameters that are important for accurate atmospheric retrievals.
Other advantages of the new structure include allowing more
signiﬁcant ﬁgures (for instance, important for line positions of the
MW transitions) and checks on data integrity. Further advantages
include immediate access to the references for every parameter
(including the automatic generation of bibliography in both HTML
and BibTeX format), generation of interactive plots of retrieved
line-by-line and cross-section data (with full features such as
zoom, etc.), and more-detailed ﬁltering (such as by individual vi-
brational bands), etc.
HITRANonline has received a warm welcome from the com-
munity, with over 6200 researchers registered with it (as of mid-
June 2017). The rate of new users signing up on www.hitran.org
has not dropped below 50 per week. Extensive documentation
regarding the deﬁnition and use of HITRAN parameters is now
directly accessible on the website.
There are a few new features that have been introduced to the
HITRANonline interface since its original release. First, in order to
make the selection of several dozen new special parameters less
cumbersome, we “bundled” the parameters associated with se-
lected line proﬁles. In the example shown in Fig. 30 one can see
how the Hartmann-Tran proﬁle can be selected.
6.2. HITRAN application programming interface (HAPI)
The HITRAN Application Programming Interface (HAPI) is a free
open source Python module (library) which provides a set of tools
for working with structured spectroscopic data from different
sources. It is described in detail in Ref. [5]. Here we give a brief
overview of its features.
Originally created as an extension of the HITRANonline web
interface [2] to allow users sophisticated calculations and manip-
ulations with the HITRAN data on their computers, HAPI can
handle user-supplied custom data in a ﬂexible way and fully
supports the HITRANonline data scheme and formats of the HI-
TRAN [1] database.
The principal aim of HAPI is facilitating physically-sound in-
terpretation of observations and more realistic models for a wide
variety of applications such as astrophysics, planetary science,
climate simulations, remote sensing, theoretical spectroscopy, and
data mining. Having such a tool is important in particular to pre-
vent possible errors in radiative-transfer calculations caused by
misuse of spectroscopic tools and databases (see example dis-
cussed in Ref. [636] for instance).
The HAPI package can be obtained via the HITRANonline web-
site
(http://hitran.org/hapi)
or
from
the
Zenodo
community
(http://zenodo.org/communities/hapi/about/). The current version
(1.1) is distributed under a permissive open source license (MIT).
Additional links can be found on the ofﬁcial HITRAN site.
HAPI consists of two major parts. First, it has a simple built-in
database management system written in pure Python, which gives
a capability of data processing and ﬁltering. Second, HAPI in-
corporates a set of tools for spectra simulation accounting for the
temperature, pressure, optical path length, and instrument prop-
erties. In more detail, the HAPI features are as follows:
 Support for standard HITRAN parameters given in “160-char-
acter” or “.par” format which is described in Ref. [3],
 Support for the newly added types of parameters such as for-
eign broadenings and shifts, speed dependencies for non-Voigt
proﬁles, line mixing coefﬁcients, etc.
 Communication with the HITRANonline web interface using the
I.E. Gordon et al. / Journal of Quantitative Spectroscopy & Radiative Transfer 203 (2017) 3–69

----- Page 54 (native text) -----
REST HTTP protocol in order to get the most up-to-date HITRAN
data,
 Python implementations for line proﬁles including the partially
correlated quadratic speed-dependent hard collision model
(Hartmann-Tran proﬁle [7,8,13,14]),
 Python implementation of the Total Internal Partition Sums
(based on TIPS-2011 [112] and incorporating a large update
outlined in this paper),
 High-resolution single-layer spectra simulation accounting for
pressure, temperature, optical path length and instrument
function. In the simplest case, the simulation is performed in a
single step using a functional approach. See Fig. 25 where HAPI
was used to generate cross-sections of ethylene to compare
with experimental data.
 Capability of modeling the absorption cross sections broadened
by a mixture of gases of astrophysical and planetary interests.
The parameters for the foreign broadenings and shift are gra-
dually being added to the HITRANonline system (see outline in
Refs. [4] [5]). Fig. 31 shows an example of how one can generate
cross-sections of acetylene broadened by different planetary-
relevant proportions of hydrogen and helium (see Section 2.26
for details).
 Flexibility in the scheme of the absorption cross-section calcu-
lation. Each part of the scheme given in Ref. [5] can be
customized by user.
 Capability of extending the HAPI functionality by adding custom
line shapes, partition sums, instrumental functions, environ-
ment dependences, and radiative-transfer code.
 Compatibility with a large set of third-party libraries in Python,
C/Cþ þ, Java etc…
In the near future, in order to improve the simulation of the
absorption cross sections, it is planned to include the full relaxa-
tion matrix calculation for line mixing for a number of molecules
of atmospheric importance [117,238,239]. Inclusion of the line
mixing in the calculation is expected to enable sub-percent accu-
racy (provided other parameters are known very accurately) for
bands of atmospheric gases to better satisfy highly-precise ground
and satellite measurements.
At the current time HAPI requires the user to be familiar with
Python, although most of the functions are prewritten and with
the help of the manual one does not need to have advanced
knowledge of that computer language. In order to extend the
range of users, we plan to create a ﬂexible graphical user interface
(GUI). This interface will give the user a possibility to simulate, plot
and compare line-by-line and raw spectral data with a ﬂexible
control of scale, units, and computational parameters (just as is
possible in the current Python version of HAPI). The new software
will support Windows, Linux and MacOS.
6.3. Total internal partition sums (TIPS)
Total internal partition sums (TIPS) were determined for all
molecules and isotopologues in HITRAN2016 and for a number of
isotopologues of molecules of interest in planetary atmospheres.
The current TIPS data are calculated in one-degree steps from 1 K
to Tmax, where Tmax is determined separately for each isotopologue
based on convergence of the partition sums. The TIPS are com-
prised of updated calculations and values from previous studies of
TIPS [112,637–639]. The updates can be grouped into several ca-
tegories: improvements in ab initio calculations that allow direct
sums over energy levels, improved Qvib values using the anhar-
monic approximation [640], and calculations for new molecule/
isotopologues in the HITRAN database. The updates that were
made for isotopologues in this edition of HITRAN are listed in
Table 13. The updates are detailed in an accompanying paper [641]
in this HITRAN2016 special issue. Note that an error was found in
Tables 1 and 2 of Ref. [641] where the values corresponding to
partition sums of the 16O17O isotopologue were a factor of six too
large. This has been ﬁxed in the ofﬁcial release of HITRAN2016.
The TIPS are made available to the scientiﬁc community in the
form of tables and codes that rapidly recall the TIPS for any mo-
lecule, isotopologue, and temperature. There are several codes that
are distributed with this edition of HITRAN: FORTRAN codes
TIPS_2017.for and BD_TIPS_2017.for and a python code TIPS_2017.
py with associated dictionaries. TIPS_2017.for is a stand-alone code
that queries the user for a molecule, isotopologue, and tempera-
ture and returns Q(T). BD_TIPS_2017.for is a subroutine application
that users can insert into their codes to return Q(T) for a molecule/
isotopologue/temperature selection. The python code uses python
dictionaries to recall Q(T). The dictionaries are labeled by the
molecule number and local ID number, see the TIPS article [641]
for details. Details are given to develop custom python algorithms
for particular molecule/isotopologue combinations. The TIPS py-
thon package was incorporated into the HITRAN Application Pro-
gramming Interface (HAPI) [5] in order to seamlessly integrate into
the cross-section generating process. The tables and codes are
available at faculty.uml.edu/Robert_Gamache and www.hitran.org.
7. Conclusions
The improvements, expansions and new structure in the new
HITRAN database release have been elaborated upon. For the line-
by-line data, improved line position, intensity, and line-shape
parameters for many of the previously existing molecules and
isotopologues have been introduced. Many new lines/bands have
been added for different molecules and their isotopologues al-
lowing for a more complete database (for atmospheric applica-
tions) and for the expansion of the spectral coverage of the ex-
isting line lists. Additionally, HITRAN continues evolving in terms
of structure and scope. A new relational database structure has
been established [2] that enabled signiﬁcant expansion of the
amount of important spectroscopic parameters provided in the
database. Literally dozens of new parameters have been in-
troduced that allow accommodation of non-Voigt line shapes [6];
ﬂexible representation of broadening parameters and their tem-
perature dependencies; broadening and shift of spectral lines due
to pressure of gases dominant in planetary atmospheres [4]
(namely, H2, He and CO2). This extensive expansion of the database
would have been very impractical in the old ﬁxed-length ASCII
format of previous HITRAN editions. An interface on the internet
has also been established (www.hitran.org) that provides the di-
verse group of HITRAN users with much power to ﬁlter, extract,
plot, and query the database. Even more power has been given to
the user through the introduction of the HITRAN Application
Programming Interface (HAPI) [5]. HAPI is currently a set of Python
libraries which not only allows users to download data from the
database but also to carry out: 1) single-layer absorption calcula-
tions at different thermodynamic conditions, accounting for an
instrument function, new line shape parametrizations, perturbing
gas or gases, etc, 2) extended functionality provided by custom
functions, line lists and partition sums.
Several new molecules and isotopologues have been added to
the line-by-line portion of the compilation, which improve mod-
eling of the absorption of the terrestrial atmosphere and beyond.
One of the main highlights of the new edition is the monu-
mental expansion of the cross-sectional part of the database which
increased (in terms of amount of gases) about six-fold and now
features over 300 species. These cross-sections can also be acces-
sible through www.hitran.org where they are divided into cate-
gories for easy browsing.

Aerosols and collision induced absorption datasets have also
been revised and extended.
The compilation is free and can be accessed through www.hi
tran.org. We recommend citing this article when using the HI-
TRAN2016 data. If an update to a certain molecule is announced on
the website and is being used, then we encourage users to cite
when they downloaded the data.
8. Future work
While HITRAN continues to be an international standard for
reference spectroscopy for atmospheric and planetary gases, there
is still substantial room for improvement. In many subsections
throughout the paper we mention the avenues for improvements
for individual molecules, but they are really just the tip of the
iceberg.
The studies of the terrestrial atmosphere require further im-
provements to the existing parameters and what is more chal-
lenging: population of the dataset of the non-Voigt line-shape
parameters. As was discussed above, the amount of measurements
and
calculations
of
the
parameters
obtained
using
the
re-
commended HT proﬁle are scarce and it will take time before a
majority of HITRAN lines will have these parameters provided.
Also, we remind experimentalists and theoreticians to take ex-
treme care when ﬁtting to these parameters to avoid correlations.
The line mixing for many molecules is now available in HITRAN
through
diagonal
(Rozenkranz)
parametrization.
Other
para-
metrizations require provision of additional software (just as it is
done in this edition in the case of carbon dioxide) that may have to
be molecule or even band-speciﬁc. HAPI offers an excellent avenue
for addition of this extra functionality.
At the moment only seven HITRAN gases have pressure
broadening (and their temperature dependence) and pressure
shift of lines by H2, He and CO2. We would like to extend this to all
gases important for planetary research. Also, in order to aid
modeling of the terrestrial atmosphere, we will add parameters
associated with broadening of spectral lines by water vapor (which
is sufﬁciently abundant to make an impact on retrievals in the
tropics, for instance).
With an exception of a few diatomic molecules (namely NO,
OH, HF, HCl, HBr, HI and H2) HITRAN data are limited to tem-
peratures encountered in the Earth atmosphere and will be deﬁ-
cient when modeling high-temperature environments including
stellar and some planetary atmospheres. The users are encouraged
to employ the HITEMP database for these applications [278].
However, there are currently only ﬁve gases that are provided in
HITEMP (H2O, CO2, CO, NO, OH) and a major update of the HITEMP
database will be released in the near future. This update will in-
clude improvement of the spectroscopy of the existing HITEMP
gases but also will introduce additional molecules.
While a major update is featured here for the cross-sectional
part of the database, we note that it is still far from complete in
terms of gases. Moreover, all of the current updates are in the IR
part of the spectrum and another substantial update is needed for
the UV cross-sections.
A massive revision and expansion of the CIA data is planned for
the near future.
Structure and the tools provided with the database are also a
very important part of the HITRAN database. We plan further
improvements to the documentation for the HITRANonline inter-
face and the development of video tutorials. Finally, development
of an interactive interface is planned for HAPI, for which video
tutorials will also be created.
