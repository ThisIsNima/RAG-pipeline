Abstract
Delirium, an acute disorder of attention and cognition, is a common, serious, costly, under-
recognized and often fatal condition for seniors. Its diagnosis requires a formal cognitive
assessment and history of acute onset of symptoms. Given its typically complex multifactorial
etiology, multicomponent nonpharmacologic risk factor approaches have proven to be the most
effective strategy for prevention. To date, there is no convincing evidence that pharmacologic
prevention or treatment is effective. Drug reduction for sedation and analgesia combined with
nonpharmacologic approaches are recommended. Delirium may provide a window to elucidate
brain pathophysiology, serving both as a marker of brain vulnerability with decreased reserve and
a potential mechanism for permanent cognitive damage. As a potent patient safety indicator,
delirium provides a target for system-wide process improvements. Public health priorities will
include improvements in coding and reimbursement, improved research funding, and widespread
education for clinicians and the public about the importance of delirium.

Introduction
Despite first being described over 2500 years ago, delirium remains frequently unrecognized
and poorly understood. Delirium, an acute decline in cognitive functioning, is a common,
serious, and often fatal problem affecting up to 50% of hospitalized seniors, and costing
over $164 billion (2011) per year in the United States1 and over $182 billion (2011) per
year2, 3 in 18 European countries combined (See Appendix). As a preventable condition in
30–40% of cases,4, 5 delirium holds substantial public health relevance as a target for
interventions to prevent its associated burden of downstream complications and costs.6
Accordingly, delirium is now included on the patient safety agenda,7 and has been
increasingly targeted as an indicator of healthcare quality for seniors.8, 9
Delirium can be thought of as “acute brain failure,” a multifactorial syndrome analogous to
acute heart failure and may provide a novel approach to elucidate brain functioning and
pathophysiology. With its acute onset in response to noxious insults, such as major surgery
or sepsis, delirium may help to shed light on cognitive reserve; that is, the brain’s resilience
to withstand external factors.10 In this context, delirium may serve as a marker of the
vulnerable brain with diminished reserve capacity. Recent evidence further suggests that the
trajectory of “normal” cognitive aging may not be a smooth linear decline, but rather a series
of punctuated declines and recoveries in the face of delirium and major medical insults.11, 12
Finally, in addition to serving as a marker of the vulnerable brain, accumulating evidence
(see “Current Controversies” section below) suggests that delirium itself may lead to
permanent cognitive decline and dementia in some patients.
The purpose of this report is to provide a state-of-the-art review of the syndrome of delirium
to guide clinical practice and to elucidate important areas for future research.
[Panel] Search Strategy and Selection Criteria
Articles for this Review were identified by comprehensive searches of Medline, PubMed
and reference lists from relevant original articles and systematic reviews (see Appendix
Table 1) using the search terms: “delirium”, “acute confusion”, and “organic brain
syndrome”. Original articles published in English between 1990 and 2012 were included. To
provide an overview of the areas of epidemiology, etiology, nonpharmacologic and
pharmacologic management, reviews were conducted from 2004–2012 to update a previous
comprehensive review;13 with the exceptions of validated risk prediction models and
nonpharmacologic studies, where we expanded our search to include original articles
published between 1990 and 2012. All data presented are taken from those of the original
article; no meta-analysis was performed. In all non-ICU settings, the study populations
included in the selected articles were generally age 65 years and older. For epidemiologic
studies, we required a sample size of ≥100; prospective sampling framework; satisfaction of
the STROBE criteria for setting, participants, measurement and statistical methods; and use
of a validated delirium instrument. The pathophysiology search used the same search terms

with the addition of “etiology”, “pathophysiology”, “physiopathology”, or “pathogenesis”.
For nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic prevention and treatment studies, we required a
sample size ≥25 in each study arm; prospective sampling framework; use of a validated
delirium instrument; and a modified Jadad quality score of ≥4 (range 0–6) that included the
following components: randomization or balanced allocation (1 point); appropriate
description of randomization or balanced allocation (1 point); blinding (1 point); double
blinding required for pharmacologic studies); appropriate description of blinding (1 point);
description of dropouts/withdrawals (1 point); and N ≥100 (1 point). Two reviewers rated
each article and reached consensus on all ratings. Since the goal of this manuscript was to
provide a comprehensive review of primary articles, systematic reviews and meta-analyses
were not routinely included; however, all of their reference lists were checked to insure the
comprehensive inclusion of primary articles in our review process (Appendix Table 1).
Epidemiology
Based on a systematic literature review from 2004–2012, articles on incidence and outcomes
of delirium were selected by the following criteria: sample size of 100 or more; prospective
sampling framework; satisfaction of STROBE criteria;14 and use of a validated delirium
instrument. The timeframe for this review was chosen to update a previous comprehensive
review.13 An additional inclusion criterion for incidence studies was serial delirium
assessments at no more than 3-day intervals by trained research staff or clinicians. Table 1
presents the prevalence rates (present on admission) and incidence rates (new onset) of
delirium across different patient populations as described in 35 selected studies (See
Appendix Table 4 for reference citations of all articles); the sum of both prevalence and
incidence yields the overall occurrence rates in each setting. The highest incidence rates
were observed in the intensive care unit, postoperative, and palliative care settings. Since
many of these studies excluded patients with cognitive impairment or dementia at baseline,
these rates likely represent underestimates of true incidence rates. In general medical and
geriatric wards, the prevalence of delirium (present on admission) of 18–35% must be added
to the incidence rates to yield the overall occurrence rates of delirium in these populations of
29–64% (Table 1). The prevalence of delirium in the community setting is relatively low (1–
2%), but its onset usually brings the patient to emergency care. On presentation to the
emergency department, delirium is present in 8–17% of all seniors and 40% of nursing home
residents.
Adverse outcomes associated with delirium, drawn from selected studies that included
adjustment for confounders, are presented in Table 1. Delirium is consistently associated
with an increased mortality rate across all nonsurgical patient populations, including general
medical, geriatric, intensive care unit (ICU), stroke, dementia, nursing home, and emergency
department. Patients who develop delirium in the ICU are at 2–4 fold increased risk of death
both in and out of the hospital;15–18 those who develop delirium on general medical or
geriatric wards are at 1.5-fold increased risk for death in the year following
hospitalization;19–21 and patients with delirium in the emergency department have an
approximately 70% increased risk of death during the first six months after the visit.22
Cognitive impairment is common among surgical patients who develop delirium, with
impairments lasting up to one year postoperatively;12, 23, 24 and physical function is

impaired for 30 days or more after discharge among surgical and non-surgical patients who
develop delirium.20, 25, 26 Delirium at admission to post-acute care is associated with a five-
fold increased risk of six-month mortality.27 Among older patients with dementia, delirium
is associated with increased rates of cognitive decline,28–30 institutionalization,29 and
mortality.29
Diagnosis
Delirium is a clinical diagnosis, which is often unrecognized and easily overlooked.
Recognition requires a brief cognitive screening and astute clinical observation. Key
diagnostic features include an acute onset and fluctuating course of symptoms, inattention,
impaired level of consciousness, and disturbance of cognition (e.g., disorientation, memory
impairment, alteration in language).31, 32 Supportive features include disturbance in sleep-
wake cycle, perceptual disturbances (hallucinations or illusions), delusions, psychomotor
disturbance (hypo- or hyper-activity), inappropriate behavior, and emotional lability. The
current reference standard diagnostic criteria are the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the
American Psychiatric Association (DSM-IV TR)33 and the International Classification of
Diseases (ICD-10) from the World Health Organization34 [Appendix Table 2]. Over 24
delirium instruments have been used in published studies.35, 36 The most widely used
instrument for identification of delirium is the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM)
[Appendix Table 3],6, 31, 36, 37 validated in high quality studies including over 1000 patients
with sensitivity of 94%, specificity of 89%, and high inter-rater reliability. Cognitive testing
and training are recommended for optimal use of the CAM. The CAM, which has been used
in over 4,000 published studies to date and translated into at least 12 languages, has been
adapted for use in the ICU,38 emergency department,39 and nursing home, where it is now
included as part of the Minimum Data Set,40 a standardized comprehensive assessment of all
residents in U.S. long-term care facilities. Behavioral checklists for delirium symptoms,
such as DOS,41 NuDESC,42 and NEECHAM,43 are used particularly in nursing-based
studies. For measuring delirium severity, the most widely used tools include the Delirium
Rating Scale (DRS and DRS-98)44, 45 and Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS).46
Summation of CAM items has been used as a severity indicator.4, 47, 48 A validated chart
review method for identification of delirium has been developed for retrospective
identification,49 but its sensitivity is more limited. The Family Confusion Assessment
Method (FAM-CAM) has been developed to identify delirium symptoms from reports of
family and informal caregivers, which holds promise to assist with early recognition of
delirium.50
Etiology
While a single factor may lead to delirium, more commonly delirium is multifactorial in
older persons. The multifactorial model for the etiology of delirium has been well-validated
and widely accepted.51 The development of delirium involves the complex inter-relationship
between a vulnerable patient with multiple predisposing factors and exposure to noxious
insults or precipitating factors (Figure 1). Thus, in patients who are highly vulnerable to
delirium, such as those with underlying dementia and multimorbidity, a relatively benign
insult--such as a single dose of sleeping medication--may be enough to precipitate delirium.

Conversely, in a young healthy patient, delirium will develop only after exposure to a series
of noxious insults, such as general anesthesia, major surgery, multiple psychoactive
medications, ICU stay, and sleep deprivation. Clinically, the implications of this
multifactorial etiology are that addressing a single risk factor is unlikely to resolve the
delirium, and that multicomponent approaches will be most effective for both prevention
and treatment.
To date, many risk factors for delirium have been identified.13, 52 Table 2 presents
predisposing and precipitating factors identified from 11 studies with prospectively
validated prediction models for delirium across different clinical populations, including
medical, surgical (non-cardiac and cardiac), and intensive care. The leading risk factors
consistently identified at admission in both medical and non-cardiac surgery populations
were dementia or cognitive impairment, functional impairment, vision impairment, history
of alcohol abuse, and advanced age (> 70 years). Comorbidity burden or presence of specific
comorbidities (e.g., stroke, depression) were associated with an increased risk in all patient
populations. In the ICU study, younger patients were included and baseline factors (e.g.,
dementia, functional impairment) were not significant independent predictors. Precipitating
factors varied more across patient populations. In medical patients, polypharmacy,
psychoactive medication use, and physical restraints were the leading factors, conferring up
to a 4.5 times increased risk. Abnormal laboratory values were risk factors in all
populations, conferring between a 40% and 500% increased risk. While a complete listing of
the medical and neurologic diseases that may cause or contribute to delirium is beyond the
scope of this review, clinicians should remain aware that both common and rare conditions
that may present with delirium.
Predictive models for delirium are useful to identify high risk patients for proactive
implementation of preventive strategies, for identifying patients who need closer
monitoring, for identifying vulnerability factors for intervention, for prognostic decision-
making, and for determining clinical trial eligibility. The ability to stratify risk can assist
physicians in explaining risks to patients and families, and can help families to better
understand the recovery process and potential outcomes.
Pathophysiology
Given the complex multifactorial etiology of delirium, each individual episode of delirium is
likely to have a unique set of component contributors, with each set representing a discrete
yet sufficient causal mechanism that may differ with each episode. Thus, it is likely that the
quest for a single cause or mechanism for delirium--the “final common pathway”--will
remain unanswered. Rather, accumulating evidence suggests that several different sets of
interacting biological factors result in disruption of large-scale neuronal networks in the
brain, leading to acute cognitive dysfunction.53 Some of the leading hypothesized
mechanisms contributing to delirium appear in Table 3 including neurotransmitters,
inflammation, physiologic stressors, metabolic derangements, electrolyte disorders, and
genetic factors. Many biological factors may interfere directly with neurotransmission
and/or cellular metabolism,54 including drugs,55 hypercortisolism,56 electrolyte
disturbances,57 hypoxia,58 or impaired glucose oxidation.59 The list of potential

neurotransmitters involved in delirium is long,60 but a relative cholinergic deficiency and/or
dopamine excess are the most commonly inferred,61, 62 correlating with the adverse effects
of anticholinergic or dopaminergic drugs.63
Other causal mechanisms interfere with neurotransmission more indirectly. For instance, the
systemic inflammatory response seen in sepsis may result in a cascade of local (brain)
neuroinflammation triggered by inflammatory cytokines, leading to endothelial activation,
impaired blood flow, and neuronal apoptosis. Neuroinflammation can lead to microglial
over-activation, resulting in a neurotoxic response with further neuronal injury.64 Peripheral
inflammation can also activate the central nervous system by several routes, including vagal
afferents, circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines,65 endothelial activation with disruption of
the blood-brain barrier,66 and microglial activation.67 The distinction between local and
distant pathologies may be artificial, however, since the different inflammatory factors and
neurotransmitters are closely intertwined.68
Advanced neuroimaging techniques may shed additional light on pathophysiology. Local
and distant factors together account for overall and regional perfusion abnormalities
observed in the delirious brain.69, 70 Total cerebral and regional perfusion are decreased with
impaired cardiac output71 and with loss of cerebral autoregulation in the damaged brain;72
both mechanisms may be at play during sepsis.73 In addition, rapidly evolving functional
imaging techniques may provide a powerful means to help differentiate preexisting changes
and more newly acquired structural damage related to delirium.74
Although delirium can occur at any age, the young and the old carry the highest risks. In the
young, neuronal networks that are underdeveloped and less complex might be more easily
perturbed.75 In the old, gradual accumulation of permanent damage to neurons, dendrites,
receptors, and microglia,76 as well as the impact of cerebrovascular disease or head trauma,
may render the old, particularly those with underlying cognitive impairment, more
susceptible to delirium when biologically stressed.77 Depending on the underlying causal
mechanism, patients may overcome a delirious state without any residual effects or,
alternatively, develop permanent neurological sequelae.78, 79 Understanding the
pathophysiologic basis for the stressors and the substrates leading to permanent damage
from delirium will advance the concept of cognitive reserve, opening new avenues for risk
stratification and therapeutic approaches.80
Evaluation and Work-Up
The most important step in the evaluation is to establish the diagnosis of delirium by
obtaining a history from an informed observer (e.g., family member, caregiver, or staff
member) and by performing a brief cognitive assessment. To differentiate delirium from
dementia, obtaining the history is critical to establish the patient’s baseline, determine the
acuity of mental status change and fluctuations typical of delirium, and to search for
etiologic clues. Brief cognitive screening should be conducted with formal cognitive
screening tests, such as the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire,81 the Mini-Cog,82
or the Montreal Cognitive Assessment.83 If time is extremely limited, then assessment of
orientation along with an attention task, such as naming days of the week (allow 0 errors) or

months of the year (allow 1 error) backwards, serial 7’s (allow 1 error on 5 subtractions), or
reciting digit spans backwards (normal: ≥3 digits backwards) can provide a basic screening.
With this cognitive testing, fulfillment of screening criteria for delirium can be determined.
Given the high rates of adverse outcomes and mortality, any suspected or uncertain case
(including those with lethargy or who are unable to complete an interview) should be treated
as delirium until proven otherwise. The initial management focuses on three simultaneous
priorities: (1) maintaining patient safety; (2) searching for the causes; and (3) managing
delirium symptoms. For maintaining patient safety, efforts should focus on protecting the
airway and preventing aspiration; maintaining hydration and nutrition; preventing skin
breakdown; providing safe mobility while preventing falls; and avoiding restraints and bed
alarms which have been shown to increase risk and persistence of delirium, and of
injury.84, 85
Table 4 outlines the suggested work-up and initial management for delirium. Several
fundamental points in the evaluation of delirium are worthy of special emphasis. First,
because delirium can be the harbinger of a medical emergency, every patient presenting with
delirium should be screened for acute physiologic disturbance such as hypoxemia, low blood
glucose, and high arterial carbon dioxide. Another challenging aspect is the occult or
atypical presentation of disease in older persons; for instance, an octogenarian with
myocardial infarction presents more often as delirium than with classic symptoms of chest
pain or shortness of breath. Thus, a nonspecific complaint from a family member that the
patient “is just not him/herself” should never be taken lightly. Another important principle is
that the diagnostic evaluation (e.g., laboratory testing, neuroimaging) must be targeted based
on the history and physical examination; an untargeted battery of testing is likely to be low-
yield.86
The electroencephalogram (EEG) has limited sensitivity and specificity in diagnosis of
delirium. However, delirium does result in a characteristic pattern of diffuse slowing with
increased theta and delta activity and poor organization of background rhythm that
correlates with severity of delirium. EEG can be particularly useful to differentiate organic
etiologies from functional or psychiatric disorders in difficult-to-assess patients, to evaluate
deteriorating mental status in patients with dementia, and to identify occult seizures (e.g.,
nonconvulsive status epilepticus or atypical complex partial seizures).87, 88 Quantitative and
spectral EEG may further assist in evaluation of delirium, but their performance
characteristics need further investigation.
Neuroimaging, including noncontrast head computed tomography (CT) scans and magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), are low-yield in unselected patients, and are recommended for
the following targeted indications: acute focal neurologic findings (since stroke or
hemorrhage may present with delirium), history of or signs of recent fall or head trauma,
fever with suspicion of encephalitis, or decreased level of consciousness with no identified
etiology.89, 90 In patients with an identified medical etiology of delirium or with preexisting
dementia,91 over 98% will have a normal brain scan. Lumbar puncture should be
considered92 in cases where the suspicion of meningitis, encephalitis, or subarachnoid

hemorrhage is high. It may also be indicated in cases where delirium is persistent or where
no etiology of delirium can be identified.
For initial management of delirium symptoms, nonpharmacologic approaches are the first-
line management strategy (see below), including removing or minimizing anticholinergic
and psychoactive medications; family or companion involvement for reorientation and
comfort; nonpharmacologic approaches to sleep and relaxation;93 creating a quiet, soothing,
warm environment; and attending to pain. Pharmacologic management should be reserved
for patients with severe agitation which would result in the interruption of essential medical
therapies (such as mechanical ventilation or dialysis catheters) or result in self-harm, or for
patients with extremely distressing psychotic symptoms (such as hallucinations or
delusions).
Nonpharmacologic Prevention and Treatment
Primary prevention of delirium with nonpharmacologic multicomponent approaches have
gained widespread acceptance as the most effective strategy for delirium.6, 13, 37
Nonpharmacologic approaches for prevention and treatment of delirium are summarized in
Table 5; this table presents 13 studies which included ≥25 patients each in intervention and
control groups, applied a prospective sampling framework; used a validated delirium
assessment, and achieved a modified Jadad score94 of at least 4 points. Of these, the most
widely disseminated approach is the Hospital Elder Life Program (HELP),4, 95, 96 a
multicomponent intervention strategy with proven effectiveness and cost-effectiveness for
prevention of delirium and functional decline97, 98 through targeting risk factors for
delirium. The interventions include reorientation, therapeutic activities, reduction of
psychoactive medications, early mobilization, promoting sleep, maintaining hydration and
nutrition, and providing vision and hearing adaptations. The program is implemented by a
skilled interdisciplinary team, assisted by either nursing staff or trained volunteers. While
originally evaluated in a largescale controlled clinical trial, over 10 follow-up studies have
demonstrated HELP to be effective in diverse settings and populations.99–101 The program
is now implemented in over 200 hospitals worldwide, but adaptations and alternatives may
be required in some settings due to constraints on resources or availability of skilled
interdisciplinary geriatric professionals. Critical factors for initiating and sustaining HELP
include: gaining internal support; ensuring effective champions; maintaining program
fidelity while adapting to local circumstances; documenting positive outcomes; and
obtaining long-term funding and resources.102, 103 The savings in healthcare costs per HELP
patient are approximately $9,000 (USD) per year.
Proactive geriatric consultation is another successful approach, evaluated in a randomized
controlled trial,5 with recommendations made by a geriatrician consult before and after
surgery based on 10 structured modules (e.g., hydration, pain management, nutrition,
mobilization). The success of this strategy, however, is integrally linked to the adherence
with the consult recommendations. Other nonpharmacologic studies (Table 5; see references
for included articles in Appendix Table 8) have included multifactorial targeted
interventions, delirium screening and intervention on geriatric units, staff training or
educational programs, and interdisciplinary consultation. Recent approaches include

interventions delivered by family members and mobility or rehabilitation interventions, both
of which were demonstrated to be effective for prevention of delirium. The use of earplugs
at night in one study had modest effectiveness in an ICU trial,104 and may be a useful
adjunct to a nonpharmacologic sleep protocol.93 The Delirium Room105 is another
intriguing concept to provide specialized management for delirium patients, but has not yet
been evaluated in a controlled trial. Unfortunately, many of the nonpharmacologic studies to
date have been hampered by methodologic limitations, such as lack of prospective balanced
allocation to study groups, lack of a comparison group, or unblinded outcome assessment.
Pharmacologic Prevention and Treatment
Pharmacologic approaches for prevention and treatment of delirium are summarized in
Table 6 (see references for included articles in Appendix Table 9). This table presents 16
studies which included at least 25 patients each in intervention and control groups, applied a
prospective sampling framework, used a validated delirium assessment, and achieved a
modified Jadad score94 of at least 4 points. While these clinical trials have used a variety of
pharmacologic approaches, at present there is no convincing, reproducible evidence that any
of these treatments are clearly effective for either prevention or treatment of delirium. In six
of these trials, there was no difference in delirium rates. In eight of these trials, the target
treatment did reduce delirium rates, but the observed reduction either had no impact on
clinical outcomes (such as intensive care unit (ICU), hospital length of stay, hospital
complications, or mortality), or clinical outcomes were not measured. In two trials, the
treatment resulted in potentially worse outcomes: olanzapine reduced incidence, but resulted
in greater duration and severity of delirium (without reported clinical outcomes); and
rivastigmine resulted in higher delirium duration and mortality. Notably, all of these trials
used different approaches to the assessment of delirium and evaluated diverse patient
populations; thus, generalizing findings is difficult. Given the preponderance of evidence,
however, pharmacologic approaches to prevention and treatment are not recommended at
this time.6, 106
Current Controversies
While research in the field of delirium has been booming with the number of research
articles on delirium increasing from fewer than 30 per year in 1980 to over 400 per year in
2011, many key aspects of delirium remain poorly understood. While some biomarkers
associated with delirium have been identified, the fundamental pathophysiologic basis of
delirium remains obscure. Thus, important knowledge gaps will need to be addressed to
move the field ahead.
Does delirium lead to dementia?
A major area of controversy is whether delirium is simply a marker of vulnerability to
dementia, or whether delirium itself leads to dementia. Ultimately, it is likely that both
hypotheses are true. There is little doubt that occurrence of an episode of delirium can signal
vulnerability of the brain with decreased cognitive reserve and increased risk for future
dementia. In some cases, delirium may bring previously unrecognized cognitive impairment
to medical attention. Delirium and dementia commonly coexist, with dementia being a

leading risk factor for delirium, i.e., increasing delirium risk by 2–5 fold on hospital
admission (Table 2). Moreover, the evidence for delirium leading to permanent cognitive
impairment and dementia is increasing, ranging from epidemiologic evidence to tissue
culture and animal models. A recent meta-analysis107 involving two studies with 241 total
patients demonstrated that delirium was associated with an increased rate of incident
dementia, (adjusted relative risk, RR, 5.7, 95% confidence interval, CI, 1.3–24.0). In a
sample of 225 cardiac surgery patients, delirium resulted in a severe punctuated decline in
cognitive functioning, followed by recovery over 6–12 months in most patients; however, a
substantial proportion, particularly those with prolonged delirium, never return to baseline.12
In 263 patients with Alzheimer’s disease, delirium resulted in a fundamental alteration in the
trajectory of cognitive decline with a 2-fold acceleration in rate of decline over the year
following hospitalization, and accelerated decline persisting over the 5-year follow-up
period.30
Additional evidence supports a more direct role for delirium in dementia. An important
study with neuropathological confirmation78 demonstrated that in 553 individuals who were
85 years and older at baseline, delirium increased the risk of incident dementia (odds ratio
8.7, 95% CI 2.1–35). In patients without delirium, Alzheimer’s pathology was significantly
associated with dementia, whereas no such relationship was seen in those with delirium,
raising the possibility of alternative pathologic mechanisms for dementia following delirium.
This study was limited, however, by a high rate of missing follow-up observations. Previous
studies in animal models and human neuronal cell culture have demonstrated that exposure
to inhalational anesthetics may induce neurotoxicity, including apoptosis, caspase activation,
A-beta oligomerization and accumulation, neuroinflammation, and mitochondrial
dysfunction.108, 109 Preliminary results in humans110 suggest some inhalational anesthetic
agents (e.g., isoflurane) may be more neurotoxic than others. Important recent work
involving animal models of delirium have demonstrated that in vulnerable animals, systemic
inflammatory insults can cause punctuated cognitive decline typical of delirium, followed by
acceleration in disease progression typical of dementia.111 Furthermore, a single dose of
lipopolysaccharide, inducing an inflammatory insult comparable to a moderate infection in
humans, has been shown to induce neuronal death, microglial activation, decreased regional
blood flow, and loss of cholinergic activation.112 This accumulating evidence, therefore,
lends strong support for the impact of delirium itself contributing to and/or being a mediator
of permanent cognitive impairment. Future human studies with careful baseline
characterization of cognitive function, control for confounding factors, and long-term
follow-up, including neuropsychological testing and neuroimaging, will be helpful to
address this important area.
Is delirium primarily a disorder of cognition or arousal?
Historically, delirium was first categorized as a “mental status” problem, a disorder of
arousal with varying degrees of obtundation. However, with advances in the field and more
sophisticated observation, delirium is now considered to be primarily a disorder of cognition
with attention and global cognitive impairments as the key features, rather than a primary
disorder of arousal alone.31, 112 This distinction is important to identify delirium that is most
associated with poor long-term outcomes. Clearly, delirium includes impairments in both

cognition and arousal in many cases. While distinguishing an over-sedated patient from a
delirious patient can be challenging, this distinction is in fact clinically relevant. Delirium
lasting for 2–3 days or more has been associated with poorer outcomes than more transient
episodes, which are often due to psychoactive medications.32, 113 Sedation scales alone
(such as the Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale, RASS),38, 114 which are neither
sensitive nor specific for delirium, should not be used alone but rather in conjunction with
tests of attention and cognition (in verbal patients) or other diagnostic evaluations.
Moreover, while carrying its own prognostic risks, the etiology, pathophysiology, and
management of over-sedation should be considered quite distinct from the management of
delirium.
Are there pathophysiologic or prognostic differences in the forms of delirium or in specific
clinical manifestations?
Delirium has two major psychomotor forms: hypoactive and hyperactive. Patients with acute
alcohol withdrawal are more likely to present with the hyperactive form. The predominantly
hypoactive form is more common in older patients, and has been generally associated with a
worse prognosis.52 While these two forms are distinctive clinically, patients can wax and
wane between the two forms during the course of a day or the course of their delirium. EEG
manifestations are not reliably different between the two forms.115 Current delirium severity
instruments (e.g., DRS98 and MDAS) tend to have more hyperactive symptoms represented
in their summative scores than hypoactive symptoms, thus tending to weight hyperactive
delirium as more severe. In addition, it is unclear whether different causal mechanisms can
be separated by clinical signs and symptoms; that is, are there different, recognizable
phenotypes of delirium well beyond the two forms described above?116, 117 Do specific
clinical manifestations, such as hallucinations, indicate a separate pathophysiology or
prognosis? Clarification of these issues with improved delirium measurement methods and
application of sophisticated neuroimaging and pathophysiologic approaches holds
substantial ramifications for understanding both the phenomenology and treatment of
delirium.
What are appropriate treatment strategies for delirium?
Current clinical trials for delirium management have focused primarily on antipsychotic or
sedating medications. While these treatments may reduce the agitation and behavioral
symptoms associated with delirium, which are often vexing to healthcare professionals,
there is no evidence that these treatments are effective for improving outcomes from
delirium. Given the limitations of our measurement instruments, a distinct possibility is that
these treatments may convert hyperactive to hypoactive delirium (which is then not
measured), contributing to these poor outcomes. Increasing evidence suggests that these
treatments may prolong the duration of delirium, prolong associated cognitive impairments,
and worsen clinical outcomes. Thus, consideration of other approaches is critical at this
juncture, including nonpharmacologic strategies, cognitive rehabilitation, drug reduction or
drug-sparing approaches (i.e., substituting less toxic alternatives), and treatments targeted
towards inflammation, neuroprotection, sleep enhancement (e.g., melatonin), and reduction
of pain and stress including complementary and alternative medicine. Our current

approaches for management of delirium must focus on treatments that enhance recovery,
maximize functional status, and improve clinical outcomes.
Future Directions and Recommendations
While many knowledge gaps remain, the groundwork laid by the current evidence in
delirium highlights a clear path to move forward. Table 7 outlines some of the research
priorities in delirium research, and the concomitant public health priorities that will be
needed to move the field ahead. Each research domain must be coupled with translation into
practice and policy to impact on the problem of delirium. Important public health and policy
priorities should include more logical coding and reimbursement strategies for delirium.
Currently, there are at least 11 codes for delirium in ICD-9 CM and 23 codes in ICD-10, yet
only about 3% of delirium cases are coded in medical records.49 Without a more logical
system to record delirium that is occurring in our healthcare systems, large-scale public
health efforts will be severely limited. In addition, comprehensive efforts to educate
clinicians and the public about delirium, including its importance, recognition, risk factors,
prevention and management strategies, will be critical to change the current state of under-
recognition and mismanagement. Delirium serves as a potent and well-recognized indicator
of healthcare quality across many settings, and creating incentives for system-wide process
improvement to address delirium will result in high quality geriatric care more generally.
Given that delirium is highly multifactorial and linked to many other common geriatric
syndromes (such as falls, pressure ulcers, functional decline, and incontinence), addressing
delirium provides a highly practical and effective strategy to improve outcomes, decrease
costs, and raise the quality of healthcare system-wide.
[Panel] Summary Messages for Clinicians
As the case demonstrates, delirium is easy to overlook without formal cognitive assessment.
A brief cognitive examination would have assisted in identification of delirium, hastened
appropriate management, and helped to reduce its associated adverse outcomes. In addition,
seniors are often on multiple psychoactive medications which increase risk for delirium in
the face of stressors such as acute infection. Falling and loss of appetite are often warning
signs for delirium. Helpful take-home messages are summarized below (See:
www.hospitalelderlifeprogram.org):
1.
Assess for delirium in all older hospitalized patients: use simple cognitive
screening and the Confusion Assessment Method. Be sure to get the history or
timecourse of any cognitive changes from an informed proxy.
2.
Evaluating medications is a high-yield procedure (the medication list “biopsy”).
Reduce psychoactive medications as a first step wherever possible.
3.
Use nonpharmacologic approaches to manage sleep, anxiety, and agitation.
4.
Reserve pharmacologic approaches for patients with severe agitation, which will
result in interruption of essential medical therapies (e.g., intubation) or poses a
danger for self-injury; or for cases with severe, distressing psychotic symptoms
(e.g., hallucinations, delusions).

5.
Involve family members in care, particularly for reorientation and prevention of
self-harm.
6.
Avoid bedrest orders; encourage mobility and self-care.
7.
Make sure that patients have their glasses, hearing aids, and dentures. Being able to
see, hear, and eat are important in all healthcare settings.
8.
Let patients know their schedule and keep them involved in their care.
Communicate regularly with patients and their families.

Evaluation and Management of Suspected Delirium*
Evaluation of Delirium
History
•
Baseline cognitive function and recent changes in mental status (eg, family,
staff)
•
Recent changes in condition, new diagnoses, review of systems
•
Review all current medications, including over-the-counter medications and
herbal remedies
•
Review any new medications and drug interactions
•
Review alcohol and benzodiazepine use
•
Assess for pain and discomfort (eg, urinary retention, constipation, thirst)
Vital signs
•
Include temperature, oxygen saturation, fingerstick glucose
•
Postural vital signs as needed
Physical and neurological examination
•
Search for signs of occult infection, dehydration, acute abdomen, deep vein
thrombosis, other acute illness. Assess for sensory impairments.
•
Search for focal neurological changes and meningeal signs
Targeted laboratory evaluation (selected tests
based on clues from history and physical)
Based on history and physical examination, consider:
•
Laboratory tests: CBC, electrolytes, calcium, glucose, renal function, liver
function, thyroid function, urinalysis, cultures of urine, blood, sputum, drug
levels, toxicology screen, ammonia level, vitamin B12 level, cortisol level
•
Arterial blood gas
•
Electrocardiography
•
Chest X-ray
•
Lumbar puncture reserved for evaluation of fever with headache, and
meningeal signs, or suspicion of encephalitis
Targeted neuroimaging (selected patients)
•
Assess focal neurological changes, since stroke can present as delirium
•
Suspicion of encephalitis for temporal lobe changes
•
History or signs of head trauma
Electroencephalography (selected patients)
•
Evaluate for occult seizures
•
Differentiate psychiatric condition from delirium
Management of Delirium
Medication adjustments
•
Reduce or remove psychoactive medications (e.g., anticholinergics, sedative-
hypnotics, opioids); lower dosages; avoid PRNs
•
Substitute less toxic alternatives
•
Use nonpharmacologic approaches for sleep and anxiety, including music,
massage, relaxation techniques
Address acute medical issues
•
Treat problems identified in work-up (e.g., infection, metabolic disorders)
•
Maintain hydration and nutrition
•
Treat hypoxia
Reorientation strategies
•
Encourage family involvement; use sitters as needed

•
Address sensory impairment; provide eyeglasses, hearing aids, interpreters
Maintain safe mobility
•
Avoid use of physical restraints, tethers, and bed alarms, which can increase
delirium and agitation
•
Ambulate patient at least 3 times per day; active range-of-motion
•
Encourage self-care and regular communication
Normalize sleep-wake cycle
•
Daytime: Discourage napping, encourage exposure to bright light
•
Facilitate uninterrupted period for sleep at night
•
Quiet room at night with low level lighting; nonpharmacologic sleep protocol
Pharmacologic management (severe agitation or
psychosis only)
•
Reserve for patients with severe agitation, which will result in interruption of
essential medical therapies (e.g., intubation) or severe psychotic symptoms
•
Start low doses and titrate until effect achieved; haloperidol 0.25–0.5 mgs.
po/IM
•
BID preferred; atypical antipsychotics close in effectiveness.
*BID=twice daily; CBC=complete blood count; IM=intramuscular; mgs=milligrams; po=by mouth; PRN=as needed medication.

diagnosis, phenomenology, severity, and
subtypes
•
Develop cost-effective approach for
delirium evaluation and work-up
•
Improve coding and reimbursement
•
Educate clinicians and public about the
importance and recognition of delirium
Epidemiology
•
Long-term follow-up studies of delirium to
determine outcomes
•
Patient experience: distress, post- traumatic
stress disorder
•
Genetic determinants of delirium risk
•
Risk stratification to identify high risk
•
Assess the economic and societal costs of
delirium
•
Policy incentives to improve delirium
recognition and management
•
Address caregiver burden
Pathophysiology
•
Neuroimaging approaches
•
‘Deliriomics’ to identify biomarkers
•
Animal models for delirium
•
Improve funding for delirium research
overall
•
Encourage interdisciplinary scientists to
address the topic
Prevention and Treatment
•
Evaluate long-term effects of non-
pharmacologic prevention strategies
•
Trials of medication reduction: more
prudent, individualized approaches to
sedation, anesthesia, and analgesia
•
Combined approaches to management, such
as music, massage, exercise, cognitive
rehabilitation, and sleep enhancement
•
Incentives for system-wide process and
quality improvements in delirium
detection, prevention and treatment
•
Provider education: delirium prevention
and management approaches
•
Public education: avoid psychoactive
drugs (including over-the-counter), limit
alcohol use, encourage exercise, and
enhance cognitive reserve
