Preface
The ﬁrst edition of the Handbook of Metaheuristics was published in 2003 under
the editorship of Fred Glover and Gary A. Kochenberger. Given the numerous de-
velopments observed in the ﬁeld of metaheuristics in recent years, it appeared that
the time was ripe for a second edition of the Handbook. For different reasons, Fred
and Gary were unable to accept Springer’s invitation to prepare this second edi-
tion and they suggested that we should take over the editorship responsibility of the
Handbook. We are deeply honored and grateful for their trust.
As stated in the ﬁrst edition, metaheuristics are “solution methods that orches-
trate an interaction between local improvement procedures and higher level strate-
gies to create a process capable of escaping from local optima and performing a
robust search of a solution space.” Although this broad characterization still holds
today, many new and exciting developments and extensions have been observed in
the last few years. We think in particular to hybrids, which take advantage of the
strengths of each of their individual metaheuristic components to better explore the
solution space. Hybrids of metaheuristics with other optimization techniques, like
branch-and-bound, mathematical programming or constraint programming are also
increasingly popular. On the front of applications, metaheuristics are now used to
ﬁnd high-quality solutions to an ever-growing number of complex, ill-deﬁned real-
world problems, in particular combinatorial ones.
This second edition of the Handbook of Metaheuristics, through its 21 chapters,
is designed to provide a broad coverage of the concepts, implementations, and ap-
plications in this important ﬁeld of optimization. We were glad to get a positive re-
sponse from renowned experts for each chapter. They either accepted to revise and
update their chapter from the ﬁrst edition or to write brand new ones. The Hand-
book now includes updated chapters on the best known metaheuristics, including
simulated annealing, tabu search, variable neighborhood search, scatter search and
path relinking, genetic algorithms, memetic algorithms, genetic programming, ant
colony optimization, multi-start methods, greedy randomized adaptive search proce-
dure, guided local search, hyper-heuristics, and parallel metaheuristics. It also con-
tains three new chapters on large neighborhood search, artiﬁcial immune systems,
and hybrid metaheuristics. The last four chapters are devoted to more general issues

Preface
related to the ﬁeld of metaheuristics, namely reactive search, stochastic search, ﬁt-
ness landscape analysis, and performance comparison. A few chapters from the ﬁrst
edition were discarded, as they appear to be less relevant.
We think that this Handbook will be a great reference for researchers and grad-
uate students, as well as practitioners. Each presentation, although exhibiting in-
evitable stylistic differences, adheres to some common principles which results in
stand-alone chapters that can be read individually.
We are grateful to all authors for taking the time to write the chapters that ap-
pear in this Handbook. We are also very grateful to Fred Hillier, Neil Levine, and
Matthew Amboy of Springer for their encouragements, support, and patience at the
different stages of production of this book.

Preface to First Edition
Metaheuristics, in their original deﬁnition, are solution methods that orchestrate an
interaction between local improvement procedures and higher level strategies to cre-
ate a process capable of escaping from local optima and performing a robust search
of a solution space. Over time, these methods have also come to include any proce-
dures that employ strategies for overcoming the trap of local optimality in complex
solution spaces, especially those procedures that utilize one or more neighborhood
structures as a means of deﬁning admissible moves to transition from one solution
to another, or to build or destroy solutions in constructive and destructive processes.
The degree to which neighborhoods are exploited varies according to the type
of procedure. In the case of certain population-based procedures, such as genetic
algorithms, neighborhoods are implicitly (and somewhat restrictively) deﬁned by
reference to replacing components of one solution with those of another, by vari-
ously chosen rules of exchange popularly given the name of “crossover.” In other
population-based methods, based on the notion of path relinking, neighborhood
structures are used in their full generality, including constructive and destructive
neighborhoods as well as those for transitioning between (complete) solutions. Cer-
tain hybrids of classical evolutionary approaches, which link them with local search,
also use neighborhood structures more fully, though apart from the combination
process itself. Meanwhile, “single thread” solution approaches, which do not un-
dertake to manipulate multiple solutions simultaneously, run a wide gamut that not
only manipulate diverse neighborhoods but incorporate numerous forms of strate-
gies ranging from thoroughly randomized to thoroughly deterministic, depending on
the elements such as the phase of search or (in the case of memory-based methods)
the history of the solution process.1
1 Methods based on incorporating collections of memory-based strategies, invoking forms of mem-
ory more ﬂexible and varied than those used in approaches such as tree search and branch and
bound, are sometimes grouped under the name Adaptive Memory Programming. This term, which
originated in the tabu search literature where such adaptive memory strategies were ﬁrst introduced
and continue to be the primary focus, is also sometimes used to encompass other methods that have
more recently adopted memory-based elements.

Preface to First Edition
A number of the tools and mechanisms that have emerged from the creation
of metaheuristic methods have proved to be remarkably effective, so much so that
metaheuristics have moved into the spotlight in recent years as the preferred line
of attack for solving many types of complex problems, particularly those of a com-
binatorial nature. While metaheuristics are not able to certify the optimality of the
solutions they ﬁnd, exact procedures (which theoretically can provide such a cer-
tiﬁcation, if allowed to run long enough)2 have often proved incapable of ﬁnding
solutions whose quality is close to that obtained by the leading metaheuristics—
particularly for real-world problems, which often attain notably high levels of com-
plexity. In addition, some of the more successful applications of exact methods
have come about by incorporating metaheuristic strategies within them. These out-
comes have motivated additional research and application of new and improved
metaheuristic methodologies.
This handbook is designed to provide the reader with a broad coverage of the
concepts, themes, and instrumentalities of this important and evolving area of opti-
mization. In doing so, we hope to encourage an even wider adoption of metaheuristic
methods for assisting in problem solving and to stimulate research that may lead to
additional innovations in metaheuristic procedures.
The handbook consists of 19 chapters. Topics covered include scatter search,
tabu search, genetic algorithms, genetic programming, memetic algorithms, variable
neighborhood search, guided local search, GRASP, ant colony optimization, simu-
lated annealing, iterated local search, multi-start methods, constraint programming,
constraint satisfaction, neural network methods for optimization, hyper-heuristics,
parallel strategies for metaheuristics, metaheuristic class libraries, and A-teams.
This family of metaheuristic chapters, while not exhaustive of the many approaches
that have sprung into existence in recent years, encompasses the critical strategic
elements and their underlying ideas that represent the state of the art of modern
metaheuristics.
This book is intended to provide the communities of both researchers and prac-
titioners with a broadly applicable, up-to-date coverage of metaheuristic method-
ologies that have proven to be successful in a wide variety of problem settings and
that hold particular promise for success in the future. The various chapters serve as
stand-alone presentations giving both the necessary underpinnings as well as prac-
tical guides for implementation. The nature of metaheuristics invites an analyst to
modify basic methods in response to problem characteristics, past experiences, and
personal preferences, and the chapters in this handbook are designed to facilitate
this process as well.
2 Some types of problems seem quite amenable to exact methods, particularly to some of the
methods embodied in the leading commercial software packages for mixed integer programming.
Yet even by these approaches the “length of time” required to solve many problems exactly appears
to exceed all reasonable measure, including in some cases measures of astronomical scale. It has
been conjectured that metaheuristics succeed where exact methods fail because of their ability to
use strategies of greater ﬂexibility than permitted to assure that convergence will inevitably be
obtained.
