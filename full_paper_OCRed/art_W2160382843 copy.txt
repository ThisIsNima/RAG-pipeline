Abstract
The fourth edition of the World Health Organi-
zation (WHO) classiWcation of tumours of the central ner-
vous system, published in 2007, lists several new entities,
including angiocentric glioma, papillary glioneuronal
tumour, rosette-forming glioneuronal tumour of the fourth
ventricle, papillary tumour of the pineal region, pituicy-
toma and spindle cell oncocytoma of the adenohypophysis.
Histological variants were added if there was evidence of a
diVerent age distribution, location, genetic proWle or clini-
cal behaviour; these included pilomyxoid astrocytoma, ana-
plastic 
medulloblastoma 
and 
medulloblastoma 
with
extensive nodularity. The WHO grading scheme and the
sections on genetic proWles were updated and the rhabdoid
tumour predisposition syndrome was added to the list of
familial tumour syndromes typically involving the nervous
system. As in the previous, 2000 edition of the WHO ‘Blue
Book’, the classiWcation is accompanied by a concise com-
mentary on clinico-pathological characteristics of each
tumour type. The 2007 WHO classiWcation is based on the
consensus of an international Working Group of 25 pathol-
ogists and geneticists, as well as contributions from more
than 70 international experts overall, and is presented as the
standard for the deWnition of brain tumours to the clinical
oncology and cancer research communities world-wide.
Introduction and historical annotation
The international classiWcation of human tumours pub-
lished by the World Health Organization (WHO) was initi-
ated through a resolution of the WHO Executive Board in
1956 and the World Health Assembly in 1957. Its objec-

tives have remained the same until today: to establish a
classiWcation and grading of human tumours that is
accepted and used worldwide. Without clearly deWned his-
topathological and clinical diagnostic criteria, epidemiolog-
ical studies and clinical trials could not be conducted
beyond institutional and national boundaries.
The Wrst edition on the histological typing of tumours of
the nervous system was edited by Zülch and published in
1979 [52]. The second edition reXected the advances
brought about by the introduction of immunohistochemis-
try into diagnostic pathology; it was edited by Kleihues
et al. [24]. The third edition, edited by Kleihues and Cave-
nee and published in 2000 [26], incorporated genetic pro-
Wles as additional aids to the deWnition of brain tumours. In
contrast to the previous ‘WHO Blue Books’ (as the series is
commonly termed), the third edition included concise sec-
tions on epidemiology, clinical signs and symptoms, imag-
ing, prognosis and predictive factors. Throughout the
series, the classiWcation was based on the consensus of an
international Working Group. This also applies to the
fourth edition; a group of 25 pathologists and geneticists
convened at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidel-
berg in November 2006 and the results of their delibera-
tions and those of an additional 50 contributors are
contained in the 2007 WHO classiWcation of tumours of the
central nervous system [35]. As the book title indicates, the
focus is on tumours of the central nervous system, includ-
ing tumours of cranial and paraspinal nerves. Tumours of
the peripheral nervous system, e.g. neuroblastomas of the
sympathetic nervous system and aesthesioneuroblastoma,
are covered in other volumes of the WHO Blue Book
series.
ICD-O Coding
The international classiWcation of diseases for oncology
(ICD-O) was established more than 30 years ago and serves
as an indispensable interface between pathologists and can-
cer registries. It assures that histopathologically stratiWed
population-based incidence and mortality data become
available for epidemiological and oncological studies. The
histology (morphology) code is increasingly complemented
by genetic characterization of human neoplasms. The ICD-
O histology codes have been adopted by the systematized
nomenclature of medicine (SNOMED), issued by the Col-
lege of American Pathologists (CAP). The ICD-O topogra-
phy codes largely correspond to those of the tenth edition of
the International statistical classiWcation of diseases, inju-
ries and causes of death (ICD-10) of the WHO.
The third edition of ICD-O (ICD-O-3) was published in
2000 [8] and contains the codes proposed in the previous
edition of the WHO Blue Books [26]. For the fourth edi-
tion, published in the summer of 2007 [35], preliminary
codes were introduced for several new entities and variants
(Tables 1, 2 ).
Entities, variants and patterns
The Working Group distinguished between clinico-patho-
logical entities, variants of entities and histological pat-
terns. To be included in the WHO classiWcation, two or
more reports from diVerent institutions were considered
mandatory. In addition, a new entity had to be characterized
by distinctive morphology, location, age distribution and
biologic behaviour, and not simply by an unusual histo-
pathological pattern. Variants were deWned as being reli-
ably identiWed histologically and having some relevance for
clinical outcome, but as still being part of a previously deW-
ned, overarching entity. Finally, patterns of diVerentiation
were considered identiWable histological appearances, but
that did not have a distinct clinical or pathological signiW-
cance.
New entities
The Working Group for the fourth edition proposed to add
eight new entities.
Angiocentric glioma
ICD-O 9431/1, WHO grade I
This newly identiWed tumour (Fig. 1) occurs predominantly
in children and young adults (mean age at surgery,
17 years), with refractory epilepsy as the leading clinical
symptom. A total of 28 cases has been reported from the
United States [51], France [33], and Austria/Germany [41].
Angiocentric gliomas are located superWcially, the most
common sites being the fronto-parietal cortex and the tem-
poral lobe as well as the hippocampal region. FLAIR
images show well delineated, hyperintense, non-enhancing
cortical lesions, often with a stalk-like extension to the sub-
jacent ventricle [41]. The tumours are stable or slowly
growing and histopathologically characterized by mono-
morphous bipolar cells, an angiocentric growth pattern and
immunoreactivity for EMA, GFAP, S-100 protein and
vimentin, but not for neuronal antigens. Despite frequent
extension of angiocentric glioma to the ventricular wall and
the presence of microscopic features suggestive of ependy-
mal diVerentiation, the predominant clinical symptoms,
cortical location, architectural pattern and outcome were
considered insuYcient to designate this entity as an
ependymoma variant. Given the uncertainties regarding

histogenesis, angiocentric glioma was grouped with astro-
blastoma and chordoid glioma of the third ventricle in the
category of ‘Other neuroepithelial tumours’, previously
designated ‘Tumours of uncertain origin’. Due to its benign
clinical behaviour and the possibility of curative surgery,
the neoplasm was assigned to WHO grade I.
Atypical choroid plexus papilloma
ICD-O 9390/1, WHO grade II 
Most intraventricular papillary neoplasms derived from
choroid plexus epithelium are benign in nature and can be
cured by surgery (choroid plexus papilloma, WHO Grade I,
ICD-O 9390/0). At the other side of the spectrum is the
choroid plexus carcinoma (WHO Grade III, ICD-O 9390/3)
with frank signs of malignancy, including brisk mitotic
activity, increased cellularity, blurring of the papillary pat-
tern, necrosis and frequent invasion of brain parenchyma.
The WHO Working group proposes to introduce an addi-
tional entity with intermediate features, designated ‘atypi-
cal choroid plexus papilloma’ which is primarily
distinguished from the choroid plexus papilloma by
increased mitotic activity. Curative surgery is still possible
but the probability of recurrence appears to be signiWcantly
higher. To reXect this concern, the proposed ICD-O code is
the same as for other choroid plexus tumours but carries the
/1 extension (ICD-O 9390/1).
Extraventricular neurocytoma
 ICD-O 9506/1, WHO grade II
The term central neurocytoma describes a neuronal tumour
with pathological features distinct from cerebral neuroblas-
toma, occurring in young adults, with preferential location
in the lateral ventricles in the region of the foramen of
Monro and a generally favourable prognosis. Central neu-
rocytomas are composed of uniform round cells with
immunohistochemical and ultrastructural evidence of neu-
ronal diVerentiation. Additional features include Wbrillary
areas mimicking neuropil, and a low proliferation rate. Dur-
ing the past decade several reports have shown that neo-
plasms occur in brain parenchyma outside the ventricular
system with similar biological behaviour and histopatho-
logical characteristics although the latter appear to exhibit a
somewhat larger morphological spectrum. For these neo-
plasms, the 2007 WHO classiWcation recommends the term
‘extraventricular neurocytoma’ and proposes an ICD-O
code identical to that of central neurocytoma (9506/1).
Papillary glioneuronal tumour (PGNT)
ICD-O 9509/1, WHO grade I 
The papillary glioneuronal tumour (Fig. 2) was established
as a distinct clinico-pathologic entity by Komori et al. in
1998 [28]. Histopathologically similar tumours had previ-
ously been described as pseudopapillary ganglioglioneuro-
cytoma [29] and pseudopapillary neurocytoma with glial
diVerentiation [23]. PGNT manifests over a wide age range
(mean 27 years) and is a clinically benign neoplasm that
typically corresponds to WHO grade I. Its preferential loca-
tion is the temporal lobe. On CT and MR images, it appears
as a contrast-enhancing, well delineated mass, occasionally
showing a cyst-mural nodule pattern. Histologically, it is
characterized by a single or pseudostratiWed layer of Xat to
cuboidal, GFAP-positive astrocytes surrounding hyalinized
vascular pseudopapillae and by synaptophysin-positive
interpapillary sheets of neurocytes, large neurons and inter-
mediate size “ganglioid” cells. This tumour is part of the
growing list of relatively benign glioneuronal tumours.
Rosette-forming glioneuronal tumour of the fourth 
ventricle
ICD-O 9509/1, WHO grade I

oplastic neuroepithelial tumour (DNT) of the cerebellum

[32], was established as distinct disease entity in a report of
11 cases by Komori et al. in 2002 [30]. Since then, a total of
17 cases have been reported. Rosette-forming glioneuronal
tumour of the fourth ventricle (RGNT) is deWned as a rare,
slowly growing tumour of the fourth ventriclular region
that predominantly aVects young adults (mean age
33 years) and causes obstructive hydrocephalus, ataxia
being the most common clinical manifestation. RGNT typi-
cally arises in the midline and primarily involves the cere-
bellum and wall or Xoor of the fourth ventricle. It often
occupies the fourth ventricle and/or aqueduct, and may
show parenchymal extension. T2-weighted MR imaging
reveal a well delineated, hyperintense tumour. Histopatho-
logically, RGNTs are characterized by a biphasic neurocy-
tic and glial architecture [18, 30, 40]. The neuronal
component consists of neurocytes that form neurocytic
rosettes with eosinophilic, synaptophysin-positive cores
and/or perivascular pseudorosettes. The glial component
dominates and typically exhibits features of pilocytic astro-
cytoma. Given its benign clinical behaviour with the possi-
bility of surgical cure, the rosette-forming glioneuronal
tumour (RGNT) corresponds to WHO grade I. It shares the
new ICD-O code 9509/1 with the papillary glioneuronal
tumour (PGNT).
Papillary tumour of the pineal region
ICD-O 9395/3, WHO grade II/III
This recently described rare neuroepithelial tumour (Fig. 3)
of the pineal region manifests in children and adults (mean
age 32 years), is relatively large (2.5–4 cm), and well-cir-
cumscribed, with MR imaging showing a low T1 and
increased T2 signal as well as contrast enhancement. In
addition to the initial 2003 report of six cases by Jouvet
et al. [20], a total of 38 cases have been published to date.
Histologically, papillary tumours of the pineal region are
characterized by a papillary architecture and epithelial
cytology, with immunoreactivity for cytokeratin and,
focally, GFAP. Although macroscopically indistinguish-
able from pineocytoma, the histology is incompatible with
a pineal parenchymal tumour. Ultrastructural features sug-
gest ependymal diVerentiation and a possible origin from
specialized ependymal cells of the subcommissural organ
(SCO) has been suggested [20]. The biological behaviour
of papillary tumour of the pineal region (PTPR) is variable
and may correspond to WHO grades II or III, but precise
histological grading criteria remain to be deWned. The code
9395/3 has been proposed for the fourth edition of ICD-O.
Pituicytoma
ICD-O 9432/1, WHO grade I
Pituicytoma is a rare, solid, low grade, spindle cell, glial
neoplasm of adults that originates in the neurohypophysis
or infundibulum (Fig. 4). In the past, the term pituicytoma
was also applied to other tumours in the sellar and suprasel-
lar region, particularly granular cell tumours and pilocytic
astrocytomas. Presently, it is reserved for low-grade glial
neoplasms that originate in the neurohypophysis or infun-
dibulum and are distinct from pilocytic astrocytoma. Less

preferred terms for pituicytoma include ‘posterior pituitary
astrocytoma’ and, for lesions arising in the pituitary stalk,
‘infundibuloma’. The WHO Working Group felt that inclu-
sion of the diagnostic term pituicytoma would help to more
clearly delineate neoplasms manifesting in the neurohy-
pophysis and pituitary stalk.
To date, less than 30 bona Wde examples have been
described, often as case reports. Clinical signs and symp-
toms include visual disturbance, headache and features of
hypopituitarism. Pituicytomas are well-circumscribed,
solid masses that can measure up to several centimetres.
Histologically, they show a compact architecture consisting
of elongate, bipolar spindle cells arranged in interlacing
fascicles or assuming a storiform pattern [2, 48]. Mitotic
Wgures are absent or rare. Pituicytomas are generally posi-
tive for vimentin, S-100 protein and, to a variable degree,
GFAP. In contrast to spindle cell oncocytoma (see below),
oncocytic change is lacking. Due to their slow growth and
the possibility of curative surgery, pituicytomas correspond
to WHO grade I. The code 9432/1 has been proposed for
the fourth edition of ICD-O.
Spindle cell oncocytoma of the adenohypophysis
ICD-O 8291/0, WHO grade II
Spindle cell oncocytoma (Fig. 5) is deWned as an oncocytic,
non-endocrine neoplasm of the anterior pituitary that mani-
fests in adults (mean age 56 years). These tumours may
macroscopically be indistinguishable from a non-function-
ing pituitary adenoma and follow a benign clinical course,
corresponding to WHO grade I. The eosinophilic, variably
oncocytic cytoplasm contains numerous mitochondria, is
immunoreactive for the anti-mitochondrial antibody 113-I
as well as to S-100 protein and EMA, but is negative for
pituitary hormones. Since the initial 2002 report of Wve
cases by Roncaroli et al. [43], Wve additional cases have
been published from three institutions [4, 27, 49]. The code
8291/0 has been proposed for the fourth edition of ICD-O.
New variants
Throughout the history of the WHO Blue Book series, his-
tological variants have been introduced if there was evi-
dence that a particular morphological pattern was
associated with a diVerent biological or clinical behaviour.
Admittedly, in retrospect, this criterion was not always ful-
Wlled. In the fourth edition of the WHO ClassiWcation, three
new variants were introduced that can be reliably identiWed
histologically and which have some relevance in terms of
clinical outcome.

Pilomyxoid astrocytoma 
ICD-O 9425/3, WHO grade II
Originally described by Jänisch et al. in 1985 as ‘dience-
phalic pilocytic astrocytoma with clinical onset in infancy’
[19], the term pilomyxoid astrocytoma was introduced in
1999 by Tihan et al. [47] who also deWned its characteristic
histopathological features. Pilomyxoid astrocytoma (PMA)
(Fig. 6) occurs typically in the hypothalamic/chiasmatic
region, sites that are also aVected by classical pilocytic
astrocytomas. PMA is histologically characterized by a
prominent myxoid matrix and angiocentric arrangement of
monomorphous, bipolar tumour cells. The close relation-
ship to pilocytic astrocytoma is underscored by a report of
two cases that occurred in the setting of neuroWbromatosis
type 1 (NF1). PMA aVects predominantly infants and chil-
dren (median age, 10 months) and appears to have a less
favourable prognosis. Local recurrences and cerebrospinal
spread are more likely to occur in pilomyxoid than in pilo-
cytic astrocytomas. The Working Group therefore recom-
mended an assignment to WHO grade II and the new code
9425/3 has been proposed for the fourth edition of ICD-O.
Anaplastic medulloblastoma
ICD-O 9474/3, WHO grade IV
This variant of medulloblastoma is characterized histologi-
cally by marked nuclear pleomorphism, nuclear moulding,
cell–cell wrapping, and high mitotic activity, often with
atypical forms. Although all medulloblastomas show some
degree of atypia, these changes are particularly pronounced
and widespread in the anaplastic variant. Histological pro-
gression from classic to anaplastic medulloblastomas may
be observed, even within the same biopsy. The highly
malignant large cell medulloblastomas and anaplastic
medulloblastomas have considerable cytological overlap.
The large cell variant features often spherical cells with
round nuclei, open chromatin and prominent central nucle-
oli. The patterns may coexist. Indeed, in several studies a
combined large cell/anaplastic category has been used. It is
proposed that in the fourth edition of ICD-O anaplastic
medulloblastoma and large cell medulloblastoma share the
same code 9474/3.
Medulloblastoma with extensive nodularity
ICD-O 9471/3, WHO grade IV
The medulloblastoma with extensive nodularity is closely
related to the desmoplastic/nodular medulloblastoma
(9471/3) and was previously designated ‘cerebellar neuro-
blastoma’. It occurs in infants and diVers from the desmo-
plastic nodular variant by exhibiting a markedly expanded
lobular architecture, due to the fact that the reticulin-free
zones become unusually large and rich in neuropil-like tis-
sue. Such zones contain a population of small cells resem-
bling those of a central neurocytoma and exhibit a
streaming pattern. The internodular reticulin-rich compo-
nent, which dominates in the desmoplastic/nodular variant,
is markedly reduced. Following radiotherapy and/or che-
motherapy, medulloblastomas with extensive nodularity
may occasionally undergo further maturation to tumours
dominated by ganglion cells. A more favourable outcome
than for patients with classic medulloblastomas is recog-
nized for both, the desmoplastic/nodular medulloblastoma
variant and medulloblastoma with extensive nodularity. It
is proposed that medulloblastoma with extensive nodularity
and desmoplastic/nodular medulloblastoma share the same
ICD-O code 9471/3.
Variants versus patterns
Tumours of the CNS often display a signiWcant histopatho-
logical heterogeneity. Surgical pathologists need to know
such divergent patterns of diVerentiation but not every pat-
tern warrants designation as a variant, since some patterns
do not have distinct clinical or genetic features. The WHO
Working Group for the fourth edition proposed that some
recognized tumours should be considered divergent

patterns of diVerentiation rather than distinct clinico-patho-
logical variants.
Small cell glioblastoma
Although small cells are common in glioblastoma, they are
predominant or exclusive in a subset known as small cell
glioblastoma [38]. This glioblastoma subtype displays a
monomorphic cell population characterized by small, round
to slightly elongated, densely packed cells with mildly
hyperchromatic nuclei, high nuclear:cytoplasmic ratios and
only minor atypia. On occasions, these neoplasms superW-
cially resemble anaplastic oligodendroglioma. Microvascu-
lar proliferation, necrosis and GFAP immunoreactivity may
be minimal while marked proliferative activity is typical.
The small cell glioblastoma phenotype frequently shows
EGFR ampliWcation [3, 16, 38], p16INK4a homozygous
deletion [16], PTEN mutations [16] and LOH 10q [38]. In
one study [38], these tumours more commonly expressed
the EGFR (83 vs. 35%) and its variant EGFR-vIII (50 vs.
21%) as compared to non-small cell glioblastomas. This
glioblastoma type appears to have a poor prognosis [38]
although in one population-based study there was no sig-
niWcant overall survival diVerence when compared to non-
small cell glioblastoma [16]. If future clinical trials show a
diVerence in prognosis and/or response to therapy, the
small cell glioblastoma may be reconsidered as a variant of
glioblastoma with a distinct ICD-O code.
Glioblastoma with oligodendroglioma component
Occasional glioblastomas contain foci that resemble oli-
godendroglioma. These areas are variable in size and fre-
quency. Two large studies of malignant gliomas suggest
that necrosis is associated with signiWcantly worse prog-
nosis in anaplastic gliomas with both oligodendroglial
and astrocytic components [36, 50]: patients whose
tumours showed necrosis had a substantially shorter
median overall survival compared to patients whose
tumours did not. At the WHO consensus meeting, the des-
ignation of these tumours was controversial. Some partic-
ipants proposed the term ‘oligoastrocytoma WHO grade
IV’ or ‘oligodendroglial glioblastoma multiforme’. The
majority of pathologists thought that more clinico-patho-
logical data should be available before this tumour is con-
sidered a new disease entity. In particular, it should be
established whether or not these tumours carry a better
prognosis than standard glioblastomas [13, 16, 31]. For
the time being, the new WHO ClassiWcation recommends
classifying such tumours as ‘glioblastoma with oligoden-
droglioma component’.
Glioneuronal tumour with neuropil-like islands
Rare inWltrating gliomas contain focal, sharply delineated,
round to oval islands composed of a delicate, neuropil-like
matrix with granular immunolabeling for synaptophysin.
Reported cases were located supratentorially [46], with the
exception of one example situated in the cervicothoracic
spinal cord [12]. As a rule, the underlying lesions were
astrocytomas WHO grade II or III [39, 46]; one case was
associated with ependymoma [10].
The neuropil-like islands typically contain neurocytic
cells but occasionally also mature-appearing neurons. Usu-
ally [46], but not always [22], these cells show a lower pro-
liferative activity than the predominant glial component
which typically shows a high degree of atypia, and consists
mainly of GFAP-positive, Wbrillary and gemistocytic ele-
ments identical to those populating conventional astrocyto-
mas. Glioneuronal tumours with neuropil-like islands seem
to behave in a manner comparable to astrocytomas with
similar WHO grade. The Working Group felt that they con-
stitute a distinct pattern of diVerentiation but that more
cases with genetic analysis and clinical follow-up would be
required to consider these lesions as a distinct new variant
or entity.
Medulloblastoma with myogenic diVerentiation versus 
medullomyoblastoma
Medulloblastoma with myogenic diVerentiation was previ-
ously termed medullomyoblastoma (ICD-O: 9472/3). The
code remains but since its clinical features and genetic pro-
Wle are similar to those of other medulloblastomas, this
lesion is no longer considered a distinct entity [14, 34] and

tric accumulation

123
it is suggested that the code for medulloblastoma (9470/3)
be applied. The descriptive term ‘medulloblastoma with
myogenic diVerentiation’ may be used for any variant
(desmoplastic/nodular, large cell medulloblastoma, etc.)
containing focal rhabdomyoblastic elements with immu-
noreactivity to desmin [15, 44], myoglobin [6, 15, 45],
and fast myosin [21], but not smooth muscle -actin alone
[15, 44].
Medulloblastoma with melanotic diVerentiation versus 
melanotic medulloblastoma
Medulloblastoma with melanotic diVerentiation was previ-
ously termed melanocytic medulloblastoma, with an ICD-O
code identical to that of medulloblastoma (9470/3). The
melanotic tumour cells may appear undiVerentiated or epi-
thelial, with formation of tubules or papillae [1, 7, 9]. They
usually express S-100 protein [1, 9]. Since clusters of mela-
notic tumour cells can occur in any variant of medulloblas-
toma, such lesions are not regarded as a distinct variant or
entity.
CNS primitive neuroectodermal tumours
This term refers to a heterogeneous group of embryonal
tumours that occur predominantly in children and adoles-
cents and show aggressive clinical behaviour. They may
be phenotypically poorly diVerentiated, or show diver-
gent diVerentiation along neuronal, astrocytic and epen-
dymal lines. In the previous edition of the WHO
classiWcation [26], these tumours were termed ‘supraten-
torial primitive neuroectodermal tumours’. In order to
include similar tumours located in the brain stem and spi-
nal cord, the more general term (PNET) is recommended.
Since this designation is also used for similar, but not
identical tumours at extracerebral sites, the WHO Work-
ing Group proposes to add the preWx CNS to these enti-
ties, in order to avoid any confusion. The term CNS
PNET, not otherwise speciWed (NOS) is synonymous
with the current ICD-O term Supratentorial PNET (9473/
3) as used for undiVerentiated or poorly diVerentiated
embryonal tumours that occur at any extracerebellar site
in the CNS.
Tumours with only neuronal diVerentiation are
termed CNS neuroblastomas (9500/3) or, if neoplastic
ganglion cells are also present, CNS ganglioneuroblasto-
mas (9490/3). Tumours that display features of the
embryonal neural tube formation retain the term
medulloepithelioma (9501/3), and those with ependy-
moblastic rosettes the designation ependymoblastoma
(9392/3).
WHO grading
Histological grading is a means of predicting the biological
behaviour of a neoplasm. In the clinical setting, tumour
grade is a key factor inXuencing the choice of therapies,
particularly determining the use of adjuvant radiation and
speciWc chemotherapy protocols. The WHO classiWcation
of tumours of the nervous system includes a grading
scheme that is a ‘malignancy scale’ ranging across a wide
variety of neoplasms rather than a strict histological grad-
ing system [25, 52]. It is widely used, but not a requirement
for the application of the WHO classiWcation. The WHO
Working Group responsible for the fourth edition included
some novel entities (see above); however, since the number
of cases of some newly deWned entities is limited, the
assignment of grades remains preliminary, pending publi-
cation of additional data and long-term follow-up.
Grading across tumour entities
Grade I applies to lesions with low proliferative potential
and the possibility of cure following surgical resection
alone. Neoplasms designated grade II are generally inWltra-
tive in nature and, despite low-level proliferative activity,
often recur. Some type II tumours tend to progress to higher
grades of malignancy, for example, low-grade diVuse
astrocytomas that transform to anaplastic astrocytoma and
glioblastoma. Similar transformation occurs in oligoden-
droglioma and oligoastrocytomas. The designation WHO
grade III is generally reserved for lesions with histological
evidence of malignancy, including nuclear atypia and brisk
mitotic activity. In most settings, patients with grade III
tumours receive adjuvant radiation and/or chemotherapy.
The designation WHO grade IV is assigned to cytologically
malignant, mitotically active, necrosis-prone neoplasms
typically associated with rapid pre- and postoperative dis-
ease evolution and a fatal outcome. Examples of grade IV
neoplasms include glioblastoma, most embryonal neoplasms
and many sarcomas as well. Widespread inWltration of
surrounding tissue and a propensity for craniospinal dis-
semination characterize some grade IV neoplasms.
Grading of astrocytic tumours
Grading has been systematically evaluated and successfully
applied to a spectrum of diVusely inWltrative astrocytic
tumours. These neoplasms are graded in a three-tiered
system similar to that of the Ringertz [42], St Anne-Mayo
[5] and the previously published WHO schemes [52]. The
WHO deWnes diVusely inWltrative astrocytic tumours with
cytological atypia alone as grade II (diVuse astrocytoma),

those also showing anaplasia and mitotic activity as grade
III (anaplastic astrocytoma), and tumours additionally
showing microvascular proliferation and/or necrosis as
WHO grade IV. This system is similar to the St Anne/Mayo
classiWcation [5], with the only major diVerence being
grade I; in the WHO system, grade I is assigned to the more
circumscribed pilocytic astrocytoma, whereas the St Anne/
Mayo classiWcation assigns grade 1 to an exceedingly rare
diVuse astrocytoma without atypia. Since the Wnding of a
solitary mitosis in an ample specimen does not confer grade
III behaviour, separation of grade II from grade III tumours
may be more reliably achieved by determination of MIB-1
labelling indices [11, 17, 37]. For WHO grade IV, some
authors accept only the criterion of endothelial prolifera-
tion, i.e. an apparent multi-layering of endothelium. The
WHO classiWcation also accepts glomeruloid microvascu-
lar proliferations. Necrosis may be of any type; perinecrotic
palisading need not be present.
Tumour grade as a prognostic factor
WHO grade is one component of a combination of criteria
used to predict a response to therapy and outcome. Other
criteria include clinical Wndings, such as age of the patient,
neurologic performance status and tumour location; radio-
logical features such as contrast enhancement; extent of
surgical resection; proliferation indices; and genetic altera-
tions. For each tumour entity, combinations of these param-
eters contribute to an overall estimate of prognosis. Despite
these variables, patients with WHO grade II tumours typi-
cally survive more than 5 years and those with grade III
tumours survive 2–3 years. The prognosis of patients with
WHO grade IV tumours depends largely upon whether
eVective treatment regimens are available. The majority of
glioblastoma patients, particularly the elderly, succumb to
the disease within a year. For those with other grade IV
neoplasms, the outlook may be considerably better. For
example, cerebellar medulloblastomas and germ cell
tumours such as germinomas, both WHO grade IV lesions,
are rapidly fatal if untreated, while state-of-the-art radiation
and chemotherapy result in 5-year survival rates exceeding
60 and 80%, respectively.
