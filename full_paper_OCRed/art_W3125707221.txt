Bibliometric Methods in Management and Organization 
 
 
Abstract 
We aim to develop a meaningful single-source reference for management and organization 
scholars interested in using bibliometric methods for mapping research specialties. Such 
methods introduce a measure of objectivity into the evaluation of scientific literature and hold 
the potential to increase rigor and mitigate researcher bias in reviews of scientific literature 
by aggregating the opinions of multiple scholars working in the field. We introduce the 
bibliometric methods of citation analysis, co-citation analysis, bibliographical coupling, co-
author analysis, and co-word analysis and present a workflow for conducting bibliometric 
studies with guidelines for researchers. We envision that bibliometric methods will 
complement meta-analysis and qualitative structured literature reviews as a method for 
reviewing and evaluating scientific literature. To demonstrate bibliometric methods, we 
performed a citation and co-citation analysis to map the intellectual structure of the 
Organizational Research Methods journal.

1. Introduction 
 
Synthesizing past research findings is one of the most important tasks for advancing a 
particular line of research. Scholars have traditionally used two methods to make sense of 
earlier findings: the qualitative approach of a structured literature review, and the quantitative 
approach of meta-analysis (Schmidt, 2008). We introduce a third method – science mapping – 
which is based on the quantitative approach of bibliometric research methods and is being 
increasingly used to map the structure and development of scientific fields and disciplines. 
 
Science mapping uses bibliometric methods to examine how disciplines, fields, specialties, 
and individual papers are related to one another. It produces a spatial representation of the 
findings analogous to geographic maps (Calero-Medina & van Leeuwen, 2012; Small, 1999). 
Science mapping is a combination of classification and visualization (Boyack & Klavans, 
2013). The aim is to create a representation of the research area’s structure by partitioning 
elements (documents, authors, journals, words) into different groups. Visualization is then 
used to create a visual representation of the classification that emerges. 
 
Narrative literature reviews are subjected to bias by the researcher and often lack rigor 
(Tranfield, Denyer, & Smart, 2003). Bibliometric methods employ a quantitative approach for 
the description, evaluation and monitoring of published research. These methods have the 
potential to introduce a systematic, transparent and reproducible review process and thus 
improve the quality of reviews. Bibliometric methods are a useful aid in literature reviews 
even before reading begins by guiding the researcher to the most influential works and 
mapping the research field without subjective bias.

Although bibliometric methods are not new (c.f. Kessler, 1963; Small, 1973), they only 
started to attract widespread attention with the proliferation of easily accessible online 
databases with citation data (e.g. Thomson Reuters Web of Science (WOS), which contains 
SSCI and SCI data) and the development of software for conducting bibliometric analyses 
(e.g. BibExcel). Bibliometric methods have been used to map the fields of strategic 
management (e.g. Di Stefano, Verona, & Peteraf, 2010; Nerur, Rasheed, & Natarajan, 2008; 
Ramos-Rodriguez & Ruiz-Navarro, 2004), entrepreneurship (e.g. Gartner, Davidsson, & 
Zahra, 2006; Landström, Harirchi, & Åström, 2012; Schildt, Zahra, & Sillanpaa, 2006), 
innovation (e.g. Fagerberg, Fosaas, & Sapprasert, 2012; Fagerberg & Verspagen, 2009) and 
others (see Appendix A for a full list of studies published in management and organization). 
Some research fields (e.g. innovation, entrepreneurship, strategy) have more rapidly embraced 
bibliometric methods, while others (e.g. organizational behavior, psychology) have been 
slower. We believe this is because the knowledge base of the former is closer to bibliometric 
methods and that this represents a big opportunity for researchers working in those fields that 
have yet to start publishing bibliometric studies. 
 
Bibliometric methods allow researchers to base their findings on aggregated bibliographic 
data produced by other scientists working in the field who express their opinions through 
citation, collaboration, and writing. When this data is aggregated and analyzed, insights into 
the field’s structure, social networks and topical interests can be put forward. The use of 
bibliometric analysis is growing rapidly. The median year of publication of bibliometric 
studies in management and organization is 2011, meaning that over half the articles were 
published in the last three years. The authors' anecdotal experience also suggests that 
management scholars are becoming ever more interested in using bibliometric methods to 
supplement the subjective evaluation of literature reviews. Notwithstanding this growing 
interest, there are hardly any guidelines for conducting structured literature reviews with 
bibliometric methods. 
 
The purpose of this article is to develop a meaningful single-source reference for management 
and organization scholars interested in bibliometric methods. The paper’s main contribution is 
the development of recommended workflow guidelines for carrying out bibliometric studies. 
We synthesized the guidelines from 81 bibliometric studies in management and organization 
(details about the selection and a full study list are available in Appendix A) and bibliometric 
methodology literature. We demonstrated the use of these guidelines by performing a 
bibliometric analysis of the Organizational Research Methods journal. Given that the use of 
bibliometric methods is on the rise and there is a dearth of guidance on how to use these 
methods, this article may provide a valuable reference for scholars interested in bibliometric 
methods. 
 
2. Bibliometric methods 
 
2.1. An overview 
 
Almost five decades ago, Derek J. de Solla Price (1965) proposed scientific methods of 
science for studying science (Boyack, Klavans, & Börner, 2005). Bibliometric methods (e.g. 
co-citation analysis, bibliographic coupling) use bibliographic data from publication databases 
to construct structural images of scientific fields. They introduce a measure of objectivity into 
the evaluation of scientific literature (Garfield, 1979) and can be used to detect informal 
research networks, i.e. “invisible colleges”, which exist under the surface but are not formally 
linked (Crane, 1972; Price, 1965). These groups share research interests and have underlying

contacts through personal communication, conferences, summer schools that are invisible to 
the outsider. Citation images of research fields, aggregated through time, reflect authors’ 
judgments on the subject matter, methodology and the value of other writers’ work (White & 
McCain, 1998). 
 
Bibliometric methods have two main uses: performance analysis and science mapping (Cobo, 
López-Herrera, Herrera-Viedma, & Herrera, 2011). Performance analysis seeks to evaluate 
the research and publication performance of individuals and institutions. Science mapping 
aims to reveal the structure and dynamics of scientific fields. This information about structure 
and development is useful when the researcher’s aim is to review a particular line of research. 
Bibliometric methods introduce quantitative rigor into the subjective evaluation of literature. 
They are able to provide evidence of theoretically derived categories in a review article. 
 
In the following section we will introduce the five main bibliometric methods. The first three 
use citation data to construct measures of influence and similarity: citation analysis, co-
citation analysis, and bibliographical coupling. Co-author analysis uses co-authorship data to 
measure collaboration. Co-word analysis finds connections among concepts that co-occur in 
document titles, keywords or abstracts. A summary of bibliometric methods with their 
strengths and weaknesses is provided in Table 1. 
 
Most bibliometric studies provide a citation analysis of the research field, usually in the form 
of top-N lists of the most cited studies, authors or journals in the examined area. Citations are 
used as a measure of influence. If an article is heavily cited, it is considered important. This 
proposition rests on the assumption that authors cite documents they consider to be important 
for their work. Citation analysis can provide information about the relative influence of the 
publications, but it lacks the ability to identify networks of interconnections among scholars 
(Usdiken & Pasadeos, 1995). 
 
Co-citation analysis (McCain, 1990) uses co-citation counts to construct measures of 
similarity between documents, authors or journals. Co-citation is defined as the frequency 
with which two units are cited together (Small, 1973). A fundamental assumption of co-
citation analysis is that the more two items are cited together, the more likely it is that their 
content is related. Different types of co-citation can be utilized, depending on the unit of 
analysis: document co-citation analysis, author co-citation analysis (McCain, 1990; White & 
Griffith, 1981; White & McCain, 1998), and journal co-citation analysis (McCain, 1991). Co-
citation connects documents, authors or journals according to the way writers use them. This 
is a rigorous grouping principle repeatedly performed by subject-matter experts who cite 
publications they deem valuable and/or interesting. Because the publication process is time-
consuming, the co-citation image reflects the state of the field sometime before, not 
necessarily how it looks now or how it may look tomorrow. It is a dynamic measure that 
changes through time. When examined over time, co-citations are also helpful in detecting a 
shift in paradigms and schools of thought (Pasadeos, Phelps, & Kim, 1998).

It is the most used and validated bibliometric 
method. Connecting documents, authors or 
journals with co-citation has been shown to 
be reliable. 
 
Since citation is a measure of influence it 
offers a method to filter the most important 
works. 
Co-citation is performed on cited articles so it 
is not optimal for mapping research fronts. 
Citations take time to accumulate so new 
publications cannot be connected directly but 
only through knowledge base clusters. 
 
Several citations are needed to map articles so 
it is impossible to map articles which are not 
cited much. 
 
When performing author co-citation analysis 
on SSCI (WOS) data, only first-author 
information is available.

Journal 
Immediately available: does not require 
citations to accumulate. Can be used for new 
publications which are not cited yet, emerging 
fields and smaller subfields. 
 
It can only be used for limited timeframe (up 
to a five-year interval). 
 
It does not inherently identify the most 
important works by citation counts as co-
citation; it is difficult to know whether 
mapped publications are important or not. 
Co-author 
Connects authors when 
they co-author the 
paper. 
Author 
Can provide evidence of collaboration and 
produce the social structure of the field. 
Collaboration is not always acknowledged 
with co-authorship. 
Co-word 
Connects keywords 
when they appear in the 
same title, abstract or 
keyword list. 
Word 
It uses the actual content of documents for 
analysis (other methods only use 
bibliographic meta-data). 
Words can appear in different forms and can 
have different meanings.

Document co-citation analysis connects specific published documents (research articles, 
books, editorials or other published material). Author co-citation analysis (ACA) connects 
bodies of writings by a person and therefore the authors who produced them (White & 
Griffith, 1981). ACA can identify important authors and connect them through citation 
records (White & McCain, 1998). What is mapped is an author’s citation image. Journal co-
citation analysis (JCA) aims to connect related scientific journals. 
 
A special form of co-citation is tri-citation analysis (Marion, 2002; McCain, 2009; McCain & 
McCain, 2002), which examines the »intellectual fellow travelers« of a particular author or 
publication by analyzing works which have been co-cited with them. It has the potential for 
researching the legacy of important authors or seminal studies. Tri-citation is a variant of co-
citation analysis where the focal author or publication is always one of the cited publications 
and provides the context for co-citation analysis. For instance, the seminal paper on 
absorptive capacity (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990) is one of the most influential papers in 
strategy and innovation. To examine the context of its influence, one could produce a tri-
citation analysis to connect all pairs of publications that are cited with Cohen & Levinthal 
(1990). This method could be especially appropriate for special issues which celebrate 
anniversaries of important publications or are published in honor of important authors. 
 
Although bibliographic coupling (Kessler, 1963) is a decade older than co-citation (Small, 
1973), co-citation has been more frequently used for mapping science (Zhao & Strotmann, 
2008). Bibliographic coupling uses the number of references shared by two documents as a 
measure of the similarity between them. The more the bibliographies of two articles overlap, 
the stronger their connection. The difference between co-citation analysis and bibliographic 
coupling is visually presented in Figure 1. 
 
Figure 1: Co-citation analysis and bibliographic coupling (adapted from Vogel & Güttel, 2013) 
 
 
The number of references shared between two documents is static over time (i.e. for the 
relationship between two documents it does not matter when the analysis is conducted) as the 
number of references within the article is unchanged, while relatedness based on co-citation 
develops with citation patterns. As citation habits change, bibliographic coupling is best 
performed within a limited timeframe (Glänzel & Thijs, 2012). It is best to analyze 
publications from roughly the same period of time (i.e. it makes no sense to couple a 
publication issued in 1964 with a publication issued in 2012). A bibliographic coupling 
connection is established by the authors of the articles in focus, whereas a co-citation 
connection is established by the authors who are citing the examined works. 
 
When two documents are highly co-cited this means that each individual document is also 
highly individually cited (Jarneving, 2005). This indicates that documents selected through 
co-citation thresholds are deemed more important by the researchers who are citing them. Yet

the bibliographic coupling measure cannot be used in such a way, so identifying which 
documents are more important than others is a challenge when undertaking bibliographic 
coupling. However, this is also a weakness of co-citation analysis: it carries more information 
for highly cited documents, but is much less reliable for clustering smaller niche specialties 
which are formed by less cited documents. 
 
The choice of which method to employ depends on the goals of the analysis. To map a current 
research front, bibliographical coupling might be used while, to map older papers, co-citation 
could be better choice (Small, 1999). The latest studies show that the accuracy of 
bibliographic coupling in representing a research front is better than that of a co-citation 
analysis (Boyack & Klavans, 2010). 
 
There are several limitations of citation-based bibliometric methods (citation analysis, co-
citation analysis, and bibliographical coupling). Based solely on the bibliometric data, it is 
impossible to establish the reason that a particular publication was cited. Different citations of 
the same publication can be made for many different reasons. The articles could be citing 
literature to refute it (negative citations). It is quite possible for bad scientific work to receive 
more citations than mere mediocre work (Wallin, 2005). However, citations for negative 
reasons are extremely rare and scientists generally do not criticize previous literature too 
much (Garfield, 1979). And even then it is not necessarily valid to assume that critics are 
necessarily right, thus the critiqued literature is likely to contain some merit. Citation-based 
metrics could be biased due to self-citation in the form of author self-citation (citing 
publications where one is a co-author) or team self-citation (citing publications authored by 
one’s collaborators). These practices tend to increase citation frequencies and are thus a 
manipulation, although one would have to publish a tremendous amount to reasonably 
increase the citation frequencies. 
 
Co-author analysis examines the social networks scientists create by collaborating on 
scientific articles (Acedo, Barroso, Casanueva, & Galan, 2006). A relationship between two 
authors is established when they co-publish a paper (Lu & Wolfram, 2012). Co-authoring 
scientific publications is presumed to be a measure of collaboration. Co-authorship reflects 
stronger social ties than other relatedness measures, which makes it particularly suitable for 
examining social networks rather than intellectual structures of research fields. Further, 
because bibliographic data contains information about authors’ institutional affiliations and 
their geographical location, co-author analysis can examine the issues of collaboration on the 
level of institutions and countries. 
 
Co-authorship as a measure of collaboration assumes that authoring a publication is 
synonymous with being responsible for the work done. However, just because a person’s 
name appears as a co-author of a scientific article it is not necessarily because they 
contributed a significant amount of work, but could be purely “honorary authorship” for 
social or other reasons (Katz & Martin, 1997). On the other hand, there might be scientists 
who contributed to the work but whose names do not appear on the author sheet. 
 
Co-word analysis (Callon, Courtial, Turner, & Bauin, 1983) is a content analysis technique 
that uses the words in documents to establish relationships and build a conceptual structure of 
the domain. The idea underlying the method is that, when words frequently co-occur in 
documents, it means that the concepts behind those words are closely related. It is the only 
method that uses the actual content of the documents to construct a similarity measure, while 
the others connect documents indirectly through citations or co-authorships. The output of co-

word analysis is a network of themes and their relations which represent the conceptual space 
of a field. This semantic map helps to understand its cognitive structure (Börner, Chen, & 
Boyack, 2003). A series of such maps produced for different time periods can trace the 
changes in this conceptual space (Coulter, Monarch, & Konda, 1998). Co-word analysis can 
be applied to document titles, keywords, abstracts or full texts. The unit of analysis is a 
concept, not a document, author or journal. 
 
The quality of results from co-word analysis depends on variety of factors – the quality of 
keywords, the scope of the database and the sophistication of statistical methods used for 
analysis (He, 1998). Solely using keywords for co-word analysis is a problem for two reasons. 
First, many journals’ bibliographic data do not contain keywords. Second, relying just on 
keywords suffers from so-called “indexer effect” – where the validity of the map is dependent 
on whether the indexers captured all relevant aspects of the text. The solution is to use 
abstracts or full texts, but this introduces noise into the data as the algorithms have difficulty 
distinguishing the importance of words in large corpuses of text. 
 
The current bibliometric landscape is dominated by co-citation analysis, which is used in the 
majority of bibliometric studies in management and organization. Bibliographic coupling is a 
neglected method with great potential for further use in the management domain. It is only 
after 2012 that the first three studies in management and organization using bibliographic 
coupling were published (Hanisch & Wald, 2012; Nosella, Cantarello, & Filippini, 2012; 
Vogel & Güttel, 2013). The limited use of bibliographical coupling partially stems from 
historical circumstances (co-citation analysis inventor Henry Small’s involvement with the 
Institute for Scientific Information, which played a key part in the development of 
bibliometrics) and partly from its own limitations as a method (limitation to short timespans, 
being unable to use citation threshold filtering). However, it is especially useful for mapping 
research fronts and emerging fields where citation data does not exist or smaller subfields 
which are not cited enough to produce reliable connections by co-citation analysis. 
 
Our search found 81 studies that used bibliometric methods in management and organization. 
Two independent researchers coded and analyzed the studies to determine the methods used, 
the databases, the software and other characteristics. We describe the details of the selection, 
coding and list all the studies in Appendix A. The descriptive statistics for coded categories 
(the methods, databases and software used) are summarized in Table 2.

2.2. Bibliometric methods and traditional methods of review 
 
In recent years the volume of scientific research increased dramatically. It is becoming 
increasingly difficult for researchers to keep track of relevant literature in their field. This fact 


----- Page 9 (native text) -----

calls for the use of quantitative bibliometric methods which can handle this wealth of data, 
filter the important works through estimating their impact and discover the underlying 
structure of a field. Researchers and especially doctoral students need to be equipped with 
skills that are able to make sense of this information explosion. 
 
Traditional methods of review and evaluation of scientific literature are meta-analysis and 
structured literature review. Meta-analysis seeks to synthesize empirical evidence from 
quantitative studies (Aguinis, Pierce, Bosco, Dalton, & Dalton, 2011). It requires that the 
researcher chooses studies based on the exact relationships they wish to explore (Raghuram, 
Tuertscher, & Garud, 2010) and aggregates multiple findings on these relationships into one 
overall finding. This is a very powerful method, but inherently limited in the type and breadth 
of studies it can analyze. On the other hand, structured literature reviews are able to handle 
the diversity of studies and methodological approaches. Such reviews can provide in-depth 
analysis of literature and provide an understanding of contextual issues (Raghuram et al., 
2010). However, this process is time consuming so the number of analyzed works is limited 
and prone to researcher’s biases. It is a real possibility that important studies could be 
excluded. 
 
Science mapping with bibliometric methods offers a different perspective on the field. It can 
analyze any type of study, as long as connections among studies exist in corpus of analyzed 
studies. Compared with structured literature review, science mapping has more macro focus 
and aims to find patterns in the literature as body of work. While traditional literature review 
provides depth, bibliometric methods can handle a wide breadth of hundreds, even thousands 
of studies. They can provide graphical description of a research field. 
 
We believe bibliometric methods are not a substitute for but a complement to traditional 
methods of review. Even when used in an ad-hoc manner, they can provide useful information 
about the research field to the researcher: which are the important publications, authors, what 
is the structure of the field. Bibliometric methods can be used in standalone bibliometric 
analysis articles or can provide additional information for use in structured literature reviews. 
Bibliometric methods, when used correctly, can provide increased objectivity in literature 
reviews. They enable the researcher to look behind the scenes and base their opinions on the 
aggregated opinions of the scholars working in the field. Bibliometrics can help journal 
editors to evaluate past publications, design new policies and make editorial decisions. 
Additionally, bibliographic data can be used as an input to other quantitative statistical 
methods which provide further insight and can test hypotheses related to the structure and 
development of a field. 
 
3. Recommended workflow for conducting science mapping studies 
 
Based on the established practices and bibliometric methodology literature, we propose 
recommended workflow guidelines for science mapping research with bibliometric methods. 
This is not intended to be a detailed how-to guide, but as an overview of the process with the 
options (methods, databases, software, etc.) available to scholars and the decisions they have 
to make at each stage of the research. 
 
The recommended workflow is presented in Figure 2. We delineate a five-step procedure for 
conducting science mapping in management and organization. First, researchers should define 
the research question(s) and choose the appropriate bibliometric methods that are able to 
answer the question(s). Second, researchers need to select the database that contains 


----- Page 10 (native text) -----
10 
bibliometric data, filter the core document set and export the data from the selected database. 
Sometimes this step involves constructing one’s own database. Third, bibliometric software is 
employed for analysis. Alternatively, researchers can write their own computer code to 
accomplish this step. Results of the bibliometric analysis can be further analyzed with 
statistical software to identify document subgroups that represent research specialties. Fourth, 
researchers must decide which visualization method is to be used on the results of the third 
step and employ appropriate software to prepare the visualization. Finally, the results must be 
interpreted and described. We have organized the article according to these stages of the 
research process.

3.1. Step 1: Research design 
 
The first, highly important step in any bibliometric study is to design the research. 
Researchers need to define the research question and choose an appropriate bibliometric 
method to answer it. Different bibliometric methods are suitable for answering different 
research questions. We summarized typical research questions suitable for different 
bibliometric methods in Table 3. 
 
Table 3: Research questions answered by different bibliometric methods 
 
Citation analysis 
Which authors most influenced the research in a journal? 
Which journals and disciplines had the most impact on a research stream? 
What is the “balance of trade” between journals/disciplines? 
Who are the experts in a given research field? 
What is the recommended “reading list” for a specific area? 
Co-citation analysis 
What is the intellectual structure of literature X? 
Who are the central, peripheral or bridging researchers in this field? 
How has the diffusion of the concept through research literature taken place? 
What is the structure of the scientific community in a particular field? 
How has the structure of this field developed over time? 
Bibliographical coupling 
What is the intellectual structure of recent/emerging literature? 
How does the intellectual structure of the research stream reflect the richness of the theoretical 
approaches? 
How has the intellectual structure of small niche X developed through time? 
Co-author analysis 
Are authors from different disciplinary backgrounds working together on a new research field or do they 
remain within disciplinary boundaries? 
Which factors determine co-authorship? 
What is the effect of collaboration on the impact? 
Are co-authored articles more cited? 
Do more prolific authors collaborate more frequently? 
Are internationally co-authored papers more cited? 
What is the social structure of the field? 
Co-word analysis 
What are the dynamics of the conceptual structure of a field? 
Uncover the conceptual building blocks of a literature. 
What are the topics associated with a particular line of research? 
Track the evolution of concept X. 
 
Citation is primarily a measure of impact so the major ability of citation analysis is to find the 
documents, authors, and journals that are the most influential in a particular research stream. 
Co-citation analysis and bibliographical coupling use citation practices to connect documents, 
authors or journals. As such, they are ideally suitable for answering structural questions about 
research fields. 
 
Since co-citation is applied to the cited articles, it is capable of identifying the knowledge 
base of a topic/research field and its intellectual structure. The knowledge base of a field is 
the set of articles most cited by the current research. This is sometimes also referred to as the 
“intellectual base” (Persson, 1994). The structure of the knowledge base is called the 
intellectual structure and refers to the examined scientific domain’s research traditions, their 
disciplinary composition, influential research topics and the pattern of their interrelationships 


----- Page 12 (native text) -----
12 
(Shafique, 2013). These publications are the foundations upon which current research is being 
carried out and contain fundamental theories, breakthrough early works and methodological 
canons of the field. 
 
The concept of research front was introduced by Price (1965) and is used to describe current 
scientific papers that cite the publications in the knowledge base. At any given time, these 
papers are recently published papers that represent the state of the art of a scientific field. 
Examining the research front of a topic or research field is a task particularly suitable for 
bibliographical coupling since this method uses reference lists for coupling and does not 
require the documents to be cited in order to connect them. It is performed on citing 
publications as opposed to co-citation analysis, which is performed on cited publications. 
Most of the bibliometric studies in management and organization examine the knowledge 
base while there is a distinct lack of research front analysis. This could be attributed to the 
popularity of co-citation and represents an opportunity for the use of bibliographical coupling.  
Boyack & Klavans (2010; p. 2391) differentiate between co-citation clustering and co-citation 
analysis. Co-citation clustering is simply the formation of clusters of cited documents, while 
co-citation analysis requires the additional step of assigning the research front papers to co-
citation clusters. This latest step is most often not performed in bibliometric studies. One of 
the problems with co-citation clustering is that the analyzed set of documents (co-cited 
documents) is not the same as the starting set of documents (core documents). Consequently, 
co-citation clustering is more appropriate for studying the intellectual foundations of research 
than for evaluating the current research frontier. Publications in co-citation clusters can be 
connected to the research front publications that are citing them. Unfortunately, most 
bibliometric software does not have this capability so it has to be done manually. One way to 
do this is to import bibliometric data into a relational database and find the research front 
publications that are responsible for co-citation links in each cluster through search queries. 
Co-citation can be used to examine the research front of a specified domain but, because it 
requires an intermediate step of matching cited and citing clusters, the resulting research front 
clusters will contain more noise than when derived from bibliographical coupling. 
 
Co-author analysis is particularly suitable for studying research questions involving scientific 
collaboration. This method can analyze co-authorship patterns among contributing scientists 
and produce a social network of the invisible college that makes up the research field. 
Researchers can combine co-authorship data with citation data to estimate the effect of 
collaboration on research impact. For instance, Fischbach, Putzke, & Schoder (2011) 
examined co-authorship networks within the Electronic Markets journal to test various 
hypotheses of how authors’ embeddedness in co-authorship networks affects the impact of 
their research. Establishing an author’s disciplinary background can reveal interdisciplinary 
collaborations. Raasch, Lee, Spaeth, & Herstatt (2013) studied the emergence of open-source 
innovation research to find that interdisciplinarity decreases when the research field becomes 
established. Co-word analysis uses the text of the titles, author-designated keywords, abstracts 
or even full texts to construct a semantic map of the field. This method can be used to 
discover linkages among subjects in a research field and trace its development (He, 1998). 
 
Science mapping is performed at a specific point in time to represent a static picture of the 
field at that moment. However, the core document set can be divided into multiple time 
periods to capture the development of the field over time. Each time period’s bibliometric 
data is analyzed separately and compared to find changes in the field’s structure. This 
longitudinal analysis can reveal how particular groups within an intellectual structure emerge, 
grow or fade away.

While these are the most basic types of research questions, the authors of bibliometric studies 
have started to examine more sophisticated variants of questions. Some authors have 
considered differences in publication and citation practices between authors from different 
geographical regions, particularly between the North American and European traditions 
(Cornelius & Persson, 2006; Pilkington & Lawton, 2013; Usdiken & Pasadeos, 1995). 
Bibliometric methods can uncover influences about which even field experts might be 
unaware. Researchers often draw on publications from outside the field, but these publications 
are rarely mentioned in literature reviews (White & McCain, 1998), which are discipline-
focused. Therefore, some recent studies tried to reveal the interdisciplinarity of particular 
research streams (e.g. Bernroider, Pilkington, & Córdoba, 2013; Raasch, Lee, Spaeth, & 
Herstatt, 2013). 
 
3.2. Step 2: Compiling the bibliometric data 
 
One of the crucial decisions authors of science mapping studies must make is how to limit the 
scope of their study and define which papers should be included in the set of core documents. 
Two main options for limiting the scope are available. The first is to search for selected 
keywords. Because not all journals publish keywords, the search should include article titles 
and abstracts. Special effort should be made to define search terms that accurately represent 
the examined field. To increase the validity of search terms, consulting a panel of scholars to 
determine appropriate keywords is a good practice (e.g. Chabowski, Samiee, & Hult, 2013). 
However, even when search terms are very carefully chosen, a database search usually finds 
studies that are not within the scope of the review. These unwanted publications influence the 
results of bibliometric analysis, introduce outliers into the cited publications and reduce the 
validity of the results. A method to sift out unwanted documents is needed. This can be dealt 
with by reading abstracts and qualitatively determining which publications returned by the 
search are within the scope of the review. However, this method has the potential to introduce 
bias into the results. This bias can be mitigated by (1) defining beforehand the exact criteria 
used for selection and (2) having at least two researchers independently perform the selection. 
The second option is to limit the scope to articles published in a single or in a small number of 
journals. This selection method is especially appropriate when the goal is to analyze the 
publications within a single journal or when the publications in selected specialty journals 
represent a valid representation of the examined research field. Of course, these methods can 
be combined to perform a keyword search within a limited range of journals and qualitatively 
select the publications for bibliometric analysis. An interesting variation of selection is the 
approach introduced by Fagerberg, Landström & Martin (2012) which relies on citations from 
handbooks from the fields of innovation, entrepreneurship and science studies to define the 
core set of documents in each field. 
 
When the core document set has been selected, authors often exclusively use documents or 
journals that exceed some minimum citation threshold for the purpose of selecting only 
influential publications and limiting the core document set to a manageable size. This is 
sometimes necessary when bibliographic coupling or co-author analysis are used which 
perform the analysis on citing publications (i.e. the core document set). If the threshold is 
established on the number of total citations, newer publications are at a disadvantage so a 
better practice would be to rank publications on citations per year. While co-word analysis is 
also performed on citing publications, the unit of analysis is a word, which means that 
thresholds should be established for word appearance. 
 


----- Page 14 (native text) -----
14 
Co-citation analysis is performed on cited publications, which can be very numerous. 
Filtering through citation thresholds is thus also necessary on cited publications for two 
reasons: (1) to limit the analyzed set to a manageable size; and (2) to ensure only cited 
publications that contain enough citation data for analysis are retained. If publications are not 
cited or are cited just a few times, it is not possible to perform a co-citation analysis so in this 
case filtering through the total number of citations is appropriate. Establishing the level of 
citation thresholds is a part of bibliometric analysis that is definitely more art than science. 
The choice also depends on whether the goal of the researcher is analysis of a wider, more 
inclusive set of cited publications or of a smaller, more focused selection. If the cited 
publications are selected too narrowly, some smaller subgroups will not be found. 
 
Bibliographic databases 
 
The Social Science Citation Index (SSCI), accessible online through Thomson Reuters Web 
of Science (WOS), is by far the most common source of bibliographic data. It provides data 
on documents published in the social sciences and the cited references they contain. 
Bibliographical data for indexed documents including article title, article type, authors, author 
institutional affiliations, keywords, abstract, number of citations, journal name, publisher 
name and address, publication year, volume, issue number, and a list of cited references is 
available for analysis. All journals indexed in SSCI are assigned one or more subject 
categories (e.g. Economics, Psychology) that can be used for filtering relevant publications. 
The SSCI was established by the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) which is now part of 
Thomson Reuters. However, it is not without its limitations: the scope of journals covered by 
the SSCI is limited to those with an official impact factor. It takes time for newer journals to 
be included in the SSCI so it does not contain data from “just launched” publications. The 
SSCI (WOS) database is the most frequently used database for bibliometric studies in 
management and organization. It contains enough data to make it suitable for most 
bibliometric analysis and is already included in most university subscriptions so it is 
immediately available to researchers working in academic settings. 
 
An alternative source is the Scopus database. Started in 2004 and owned by Elsevier, it is 
recommended by some bibliometricians as having a wider coverage than the SSCI (SciTech 
Strategies, 2012). This broader coverage is useful for mapping smaller research areas that 
would be insufficiently covered by the SSCI (WOS) database. The importing of data from 
Scopus is supported by the most commonly used bibliometric software packages, but its use is 
not yet widespread among management and organization scholars as Scopus was employed 
by only three studies (c.f. Gerdsri, Kongthon, & Vatananan, 2013; Hanisch & Wald, 2012; 
Walter & Ribiere, 2013). An additional advantage of Scopus is that it contains data for all 
authors in cited references making author-based citation and co-citation analysis more 
accurate. 
 
Google Scholar has gained prominence among academics since it has become the most widely 
used tool for searching scientific publications. Google Scholar includes a broader range of 
publications than SSCI (WOS) and includes citation data so it is a potentially useful database 
for bibliometric analysis. However, Google Scholar does not provide a user interface or API 
(application programming interface) to enable the exporting of a document set with cited 
references, which would be needed for bibliometric analysis. It would be potentially feasible 
to write a program that would download the data from Google Scholar, but Google’s policy is 
to not allow automatic downloading so this approach is not stable and bound to be blocked by 


----- Page 15 (native text) -----
15 
Google. Due to these shortcomings, Google Scholar currently cannot be easily used for 
bibliometric analysis. 
 
Some limitations of bibliometric methods are the consequence of the nature of data in 
bibliographic databases. The cited reference data from the SSCI only contain information 
about the first authors of cited publications, meaning that the contributions of second and 
other authors are underestimated. This is especially noticeable in some seminal, highly cited 
co-authored contributions (e.g. Dan Levinthal is the second author of the highly cited 1990 
Cohen & Levinthal absorptive capacity paper, this omission alone is enough to produce a 
biased list of top cited authors). The SSCI does not cover all scientific literature – some 
relevant journals are not included. They do not encompass working papers and papers 
published in open archives like arXiv and SSRN. Important contributions could be missed as 
a consequence of this insufficient coverage. Another alternative to established online 
databases is for researchers to construct their own database based on several different sources. 
 
3.3. Step 3: Analysis 
 
The analysis begins with preprocessing. To achieve accurate results it is necessary to clean the 
data. Although most bibliometric data are reliable, cited references sometimes contain 
multiple versions of the same publication and different spellings of an author’s names. 
Moreover, since authors are usually abbreviated by their surname and first initial, this poses a 
problem with some very common names (e.g. Lee, Smith) and authors with two first names 
(e.g. David Bruce Audretsch could appear as both “Audretsch D.” and “Audretsch D.B.”). 
Cited journals might also appear in slightly different forms. Books have different editions, 
which can appear as different citations (e.g. Yin’s “Case Study Research: Design and 
Methods” could appear as Yin 1984, Yin 1994 or even Yin 2009). While the choice of 
whether to aggregate different editions of books remains for the researcher, different spellings 
of authors and journals should be corrected when these are the units of analysis. Researchers 
should aggregate author or journal data under one spelling and eliminate all the others. This is 
especially important for author and journal co-citation analysis, co-author analysis, and 
citation analysis. Corrections can be made with more sophisticated tools that allow calculating 
similarities between text strings or through capabilities of bibliometric software packages. 
 
When performing co-word analysis it is often desirable to reduce various representations of 
concepts to one form. A stemming algorithm is the procedure that transforms words to their 
root form. For example, the concept of “innovation” could appear in several forms: innovation 
(singular), innovations (plural), innovativeness (noun), innovative (adjective)… A stemming 
algorithm would reduce all these different appearances to the root “innov” which would 
represent the concept of innovation. As demonstrated here, stemmed words can be difficult to 
read for humans so replacing the root with the most common full word is advisable. 
 
Bibliometric software 
 
Several software tools are available to facilitate the bibliometric analysis of scientific 
literature. Bibliometric tools take raw bibliographic data (e.g. an export from Web of 
Science), perform bibliometric calculations and calculate the similarity matrices between 
items (documents, authors, journals, words). They have some analytic capabilities, but 
normally rely on exporting data for statistical and visualization software for further analysis. 
In this section, we will briefly introduce three bibliometric tools: BibExcel (Persson, Danell, 


----- Page 16 (native text) -----
16 
& Wiborg Schneider, 2009), Sitkis (Schildt et al., 2006) and SciMAT (Cobo et al., 2012). 
BibExcel and Sitkis were the tools most often referenced in bibliometric analyses. 
Interestingly, several studies report using Microsoft Excel to perform bibliometric 
calculations. 
 
BibExcel was developed by Olle Persson (Persson et al., 2009) and is the software most used 
for performing bibliometric analysis in management and organization. Although its user 
interface cannot be described as being very friendly, it can be learned quickly and is very 
efficient. BibExcel can perform all bibliometric methods (co-citation, bibliographical 
coupling, co-author, and co-word analysis) and has many additional features (e.g. word 
stemmer to aid co-word analysis). Its website contains many tutorials on how to use the 
software for various bibliometric analyses. Exporting options include co-occurrence matrices 
for later use in statistical software and network formats that can be used in network analysis 
packages. BibExcel is easy to learn and very quick to operate. Its main drawbacks are the lack 
of advanced preprocessing capabilities for data cleaning and its quirky user interface. If the 
goal of the researcher is to produce quick bibliometric calculations and perform data cleaning 
and advanced analysis in other programs, BibExcel is the right choice. 
 
Sitkis (Schildt, 2005) was developed by Henri A. Schildt at the Helsinki University of 
Technology. It is a bibliometric data management tool that can be used for aiding reviews and 
bibliometric calculations. With Sitkis it is possible to perform basic data preprocessing tasks 
and perform co-citation and co-author analysis. Data can be exported to tab-delimited Excel-
friendly text files that can also be used in UCINET network analysis software. One distinct 
feature of Sitkis is that it implements a dense network subgrouping algorithm – a clustering 
procedure developed especially for bibliometric analysis (Schildt & Mattsson, 2006). The tool 
is relatively simple to use, but uses legacy technology (Access) for database storage and is no 
longer being actively developed. The last version of this software dates from 2005. We would 
thus recommend using this software option predominantly if a researcher already has Sitkis 
experience. 
 
SciMAT (Cobo et al., 2012) is one of the newer additions to bibliometric software options. 
Developed by a research group at the University of Granada, SciMAT is software that covers 
the whole workflow of science mapping from data preprocessing to visualization. It has a 
better user interface, superior preprocessing capabilities for cleaning the data, and is a more 
recent and open source. It guides the user through whole workflow, being in this sense more 
rigid than BibExcel. It is good software for carrying out a thorough science mapping 
procedure, but it is more difficult to do “quick and dirty” ad-hoc analyses in SciMAT. Its 
main drawback is the current lack of a user interface to export data matrices that could be 
used in statistical software. Users can export the data for further analyses only through 
(undocumented) scripts or limit the analyses to those done in SciMAT. 
 
At least two other software options are worth mentioning. Loet Leydesdorff’s website stores a 
number of simple software programs that implement various bibliometric methods 
(Leydesdorff, 1999). These are very basic programs run from the command line that 
transform WOS data into matrices that can be used in statistical and network analysis 
software. Its use is very simple, but its preprocessing capabilities are very limited. CiteSpace 
II (Chen, 2006) is another option with comprehensive bibliometric capabilities. It has many 
features far beyond what is needed for basic science mapping, but the learning curve is pretty 
steep. For a comprehensive analysis of available bibliometric software and their features, see 
Cobo, Lopez-Herrera, Herrera-Viedma, & Herrera (2011).

Identifying subfields 
 
Identifying subfields with quantitative analysis is one of the biggest strengths of bibliometric 
methods. Various dimensionality reduction techniques are applied. The most common are 
exploratory factor analysis, cluster analysis, multidimensional scaling (MDS), and network 
analysis community finding algorithms (Cobo et al., 2012). Researchers are advised to use 
several grouping methods simultaneously to check the robustness of the results. 
 
Exploratory factor analysis, cluster analysis, and multidimensional scaling require a similarity 
matrix (produced with bibliometric software) as an input for statistical software (e.g. SPSS, 
Stata, R). Bibliometric software produces a co-occurrence frequency matrix in which the 
elements of the matrix are co-citations (for co-citation analysis), shared reference counts (for 
bibliographical coupling), number of coauthored papers (for co-author analysis) or word co-
occurrences (for co-word analysis). However, normalized similarity measures are often 
preferred to raw co-occurrence counts, e.g. Pearson’s r, Salton’s cosine, Jaccard index. These 
measures normalize the matrix and compensate for different occurrence levels among items. 
Normalization is especially recommended for cluster analysis as it is sensitive to scaling 
issues, but exploratory factor analysis and MDS benefit from normalization as well. Network 
analysis algorithms also use network topology to find network subgroups and can work with 
raw co-occurrence counts so normalization of a similarity measure is not necessary (Wallace, 
Gingras, & Duhon, 2009). 
 
The similarity measure most often used is Pearson’s r correlation. However, its use has been 
the subject of considerable controversy in bibliometric methodological literature. Ahlgren, 
Jarneving, & Rousseau (2003) claimed that Pearson’s r does not satisfy mathematical 
requirements for a good similarity measure and suggested that other measures should be 
preferred. However, White (2003) showed that for practical purposes Pearson’s r is a valid 
and robust measure of similarity for the purpose of mapping research specialties that 
consistently produces interpretable maps. 
 
Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) with principal component analysis (PCA) as an extraction 
method is one of the most frequently used techniques for finding subgroups in bibliometric 
studies. Since no theoretical relationships between factors are expected in advance, PCA as an 
extraction method is appropriate (Conway & Huffcutt, 2003), but requires the researcher to 
specify the number of factors in advance. Several methods exist for choosing the number of 
factors: scree test, Kaiser’s criterion and others. We suggest using these methods just as a 
starting point. Choosing the number of factors is a substantive as well as a statistical issue 
(Fabrigar, Wegener, MacCallum, & Strahan, 1999). Several solutions with various factors 
should be examined to determine their interpretability/practicality before the number of 
factors is determined. If too few factors are used, the latent structure is not revealed while, if 
too many factors are used, it becomes difficult to interpret the findings. Accordingly, several 
trials should be performed to arrive at the best representation of the data. 
 
One advantage of EFA is that because items (documents, authors, journals, words) can load 
on to more than one factor, it can demonstrate the breadth of contributions that span multiple 
factors. Important work is also often universal so it would be assigned to multiple subgroups 
of publications (Börner et al., 2003). Items with loadings greater than 0.7 should be regarded 
as core contributions to that factor and loadings larger than 0.4 should be reported as factor 
members (McCain, 1990). There are two types of rotation methods in FA: orthogonal and 
oblique. Orthogonal rotation assumes that factors are not correlated and works best when 


----- Page 18 (native text) -----
18 
factors are independent (Zhao & Strotmann, 2008). Oblique rotation is useful when factors are 
correlated and can produce a component correlation matrix to indicate the degree of 
correlation between factors. Because bibliographic data represents subgroups of a research 
specialty, we can reasonably expect factors to be correlated (McCain, 1990) but, if factors are 
uncorrelated, orthogonal and oblique rotations will give similar results (Conway & Huffcutt, 
2003). Therefore, oblique rotation is the preferred method when dealing with bibliographic 
data. 
 
Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) is another frequently used technique for finding 
subgroups. This method produces a dendogram based on the similarity of analyzed items, the 
choice of where to cut the dendogram to produce clusters is left to the researcher. HCA has no 
generally accepted stopping rules to guide the researcher to the best set of clusters (McCain, 
1990). There is a variety of HCA procedures: single linkage, complete linkage, average 
linkage, Ward’s method. Of these, Ward’s method is the most frequently used for bibliometric 
analysis. McCain (1990) found that both complete linkage and Ward’s method produce 
similar and interpretable results. Because all analyzed items are contained in the solution, 
filtering of unwanted items beforehand is necessary. Using absolute citation counts in a 
matrix is less appropriate for clustering algorithms as they produce a network in which the 
most cited publications dominate (Gmür, 2003). 
 
Multidimensional scaling (MDS) can analyze any kind of similarity matrix. It produces a map 
of objects in a low- (usually two-) dimensional space by optimizing distances between objects 
to reflect a similarity measure. Items regarded as more similar are presented as closer on the 
map. The items, however, are not explicitly assigned to groups; this decision is left to the 
researcher. MDS is limited to small data sets as big maps become increasingly difficult to 
read and interpret. It does not produce explicit links between objects and its major drawback 
is that there are no firm rules to interpret the nature of the resulting dimensions (Börner et al., 
2003). Compared with other methods for identifying subfields in this section, MDS has 
serious limitations and few relative advantages. 
 
Network community finding algorithms have made several important advances in recent years 
due to the explosion of interest in the Internet, which can be analyzed with social network 
analysis methods. However, these advances are still not being exploited in bibliometric 
studies to a full extent so network analysis algorithms continue to hold huge potential for the 
future. In this section, we will describe two effective community finding algorithms: the 
Louvain method (Blondel, Guillaume, Lambiotte, & Lefebvre, 2008) and the Islands 
algorithm (Zaveršnik & Batagelj, 2004). Several other network community finding methods 
exist which have not yet been used in bibliometric studies. For a detailed and comprehensive 
treatment of the various network community finding methods, see Fortunato (2010). 
 
The Louvain method (Blondel et al., 2008) has been found to be very fast for large networks 
and to provide excellent accuracy (Liu, Glänzel, & Moor, 2012). This method uses the notion 
of network modularity, which measures the meaningfulness of network division into 
communities. The Louvain algorithm starts with assigning each node to separate community. 
It then iterates through all communities, checking whether adding a node from one 
community to another causes an increase in modularity and choosing the change with greatest 
increase in modularity. It repeats the process until there is no change in community structure. 
The method works very well on co-citation networks and can be used on extremely large 
networks. The limitation of the Louvain method is that it assigns all network nodes to groups 
so item filtering to include only important items is necessary beforehand. Sometimes there are 


----- Page 19 (native text) -----
19 
items in the network that substantially do not belong to any group, but are assigned one 
anyhow or the method produces artifacts - groups with just one node. 
 
The Islands algorithm (Zaveršnik & Batagelj, 2004) can be illustrated with a mountain range 
submerged in water (in our case, the height of the mountains represents similarity strength 
between units of analysis – documents, authors, journals or words). When the water is 
drained, the highest peak appears as an island first, and then the lower peaks gradually 
emerge. These islands represent clusters of highly similar items. An important advantage of 
this algorithm is that it can uncover groups of publications with varying degrees of link 
intensity. In case of co-citation links, it enables less cited groups of items to be uncovered. In 
summary, a group of items represents a peak within a mountain range when within-group 
similarity links are stronger than those with out-of-group publications. The main advantage of 
the Islands algorithm is that the found groups (islands) are only a subset of the whole network 
and so it is not necessary to limit the number of items beforehand. The groups that are found 
are very dense and cohesive, but are usually smaller than those found with other methods 
because only the strongest members are included. 
 
Exploratory factor analysis, cluster analysis, and MDS provide complementary, often 
reinforcing results when used on the same or related similarity matrices (McCain, 1990). 
Several researchers found very consistent results when applying cluster analysis and 
exploratory factor analysis to the same bibliometric data (e.g. Di Stefano, Gambardella, & 
Verona, 2012; Samiee & Chabowski, 2012). The advantage of exploratory factor analysis 
over cluster analysis is that it does not force objects into groups (clusters), but is able to 
accommodate the universality of work, which can belong to multiple factors. This property of 
exploratory factor analysis can make a clear delimitation of subgroups difficult, but it can 
identify publications that serve as boundary spanners between different subtopics of research. 
However, Gmür (2003) found that factor analysis in the conditions of high structural 
complexity does not generate a true representation of co-citation clusters. Network analysis 
methods are a fresh approach to finding subgroups which has yet to take hold in bibliometric 
studies. We believe network analysis methods have several advantages that make them 
worthwhile using: they are effective and accurate, do not require normalization of similarity 
matrices (so researchers can avoid the controversy over which similarity measure to choose), 
and the analysis can be done within the same software tool that is used for visualization. 
 
3.4. Step 4: Visualization 
 
The map of a field is primarily a visualization of its network structure. Traditionally, 
multidimensional scaling (MDS) was the approach most often used for visualizing 
bibliometric data (White & McCain, 1998). MDS is a technique for creating maps from 
proximity matrices so that an underlying structure can be studied (McCain, 1990). However, 
MDS is gradually being supplanted by network analysis visualization methods. 
 
Network analysis produces visualizations of scientific fields in which network nodes represent 
units of analysis (e.g. documents, authors, journals, words) and network ties represent 
similarity connections. More strongly connected nodes are drawn closer together. Depending 
on the unit of analysis, several different types of maps of a scientific field can be constructed. 
The most common are maps based on documents. Author-based maps are also widespread 
(Börner et al., 2003) and come in two forms: author co-citation maps are constructed to 
represent the intellectual structure of a field, while co-authorship maps are used to reveal the 


----- Page 20 (native text) -----
20 
structure of scientific networks based on collaborations. Finally, semantic maps (i.e. co-word 
analyses) can be used to represent the cognitive structure of a field. 
 
Showing different units of analysis is possible on the same map with 2-mode networks, but 
this has been used very rarely. An exception is Vogel (2012) where an innovative map of an 
entire management discipline featured connections among research field subgroups 
(document groups collapsed into clusters) and scientific journals. Zhao & Strotmann (2008) 
presented an alternative visualization of a research field in a 2-mode network, where 
subgroups found by PCA are represented as type-1 nodes connected to the authors (type-2 
nodes). Authors could be connected to several subgroups. 
 
The choice of layout algorithm determines the aesthetics and usefulness of network drawing. 
The most common layout algorithms are Kamada-Kawai and Fruchterman-Reingold. Both are 
members of the spring-embedder family of algorithms (Kobourov, 2012). These are typically 
useful for small networks (Boyack & Klavans, 2014) because the graph layouts generally 
have many local minima which makes it difficult for algorithms to produce good layouts of 
large graphs. Fruchterman-Reingold aims to keep adjacent nodes close together, while 
Kamada-Kawai takes a graph-theoretic approach. It tries to minimize the difference between 
geometric distances between two nodes in a network drawing and the graph-theoretic pairwise 
distances. The latter are determined by the shortest path between the nodes. One 
recommended option is to first use the Kamada-Kawai algorithm for an approximate layout 
and to subsequently employ the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm to improve the drawing 
(Collberg, Kobourov, Nagra, Pitts, & Wampler, 2003). 
 
Network analysis software can calculate centrality measures (e.g. degree, betweenness, 
closeness). These measures have different meanings depending on the network analyzed. In a 
co-authorship network, an author’s degree centrality represents how many other authors have 
written a paper with him (Fischbach et al., 2011). High betweenness centrality is an indicator 
that an author is a bridge between different research streams. Authors scoring high on 
closeness centrality can reach other authors in the network through a shorter chain. 
 
With the advancement of network analysis tools we see no compelling reason to continue 
using MDS for visualization purposes. Network analysis software can produce MDS-like 
visualizations, but has many more options and features to choose from. The software 
packages most often used for network visualization are UCINET (Borgatti, Everett, & 
Freeman, 2002) and Pajek (Batagelj & Mrvar, 1998). Both of these software tools have a long 
history and a large number of features. Their main drawback is the limited number of 
community finding algorithms that are implemented in these packages. In addition, their 
speed of development is slower compared to open-source tools like Gephi and the R iGraph 
package. 
 
Gephi is open-source network analysis and visualization software that is fast gaining traction 
in the social network analysis community. Its rapid development is due to its open-source 
nature and because it is more easily extendable than other options. Another visualization 
option is the statistical software R with its powerful iGraph package (also available in 
Python). A big advantage of iGraph package is that it has already implemented a large 
number of community finding algorithms. R is also a very flexible environment that can 
handle very different analysis tasks including PCA, MDS and/or cluster analysis. Producing 
basic bibliometric calculations in specific bibliometric software and handling all other 
analysis in R is a very powerful and flexible option.

One challenge researchers face is how to visualize the changes in the research field through 
several time periods. A good option to represent these changes is a bar graph, where each row 
represents a publication in the intellectual structure and the width of a bar left or right from 
the zero axis represents whether this publication was more or less influential than in the 
previous period. A good example of the use of this graph can be found in Shafique (2013; p. 
74). When implementing co-word analysis, an additional option for visualization of the 
conceptual structure of a field are graphs called heat maps. These maps use warmer colors and 
bolded fonts to emphasize concepts that are frequently used, while words which are used only 
sporadically are shown in colder colors and subdued smaller fonts. An example of a heat map 
is shown in Figure 3, which visualizes the words in abstracts of research papers dealing with 
the high-tech firms published in management journals between 1973 and 1998. Two large 
groups of words can be distinguished: the first deals with the role of high-tech firms in 
economic growth, the second shows the words related to the management of high-tech firms.

tech firms published in 1973 to 1998 
 
 
 
3.5. Step 5: Interpretation 
 
The final step in bibliometric analysis is to interpret the findings. Bibliometrics is no 
substitute for extensive reading in the field. Documents that appear in the analysis need to be 
thoroughly examined to reach valid conclusions. Researchers with in-depth knowledge of the 
field have a distinctive advantage here. However, they need to be careful not to try to fit the 
analysis to their existing preconceptions, but the opposite: to use their knowledge to enhance 
the findings. Bibliometric methods will often reveal the structure of a field differently from 
the classification of traditional literature reviews so these differences need to be reconciled. 
Science maps provide a starting point for analytical examination, but are not an end in itself. 
Interpretation strategies in bibliometric analysis are dependent on the focus of the paper 
authors are writing. We argue there are three major types of focus bibliometric papers can 
have: focus on structure, focus on dynamics and focus on a narrow research question. 
 
First type of paper focuses on structure. The aim is to analyze the relations among structural 
elements (groups of publications, authors, concepts), find how they relate and influence each 


----- Page 22 (native text) -----
22 
other and examine their role in substantive questions the research field asks. Focus on 
dynamics is the second type of paper that can employ bibliometric methods. The goal of this 
type of paper is to track the development of a research field through time. Researchers should 
divide the bibliographic data into several multi-year periods and take snapshots of the 
structure of the field for each interval. Interpretation strategy would then try to explain how 
the structure changed and why did this happen. It would determine which elements are new in 
certain period and which are in decline. A good example of this type of focus is Vogel (2012), 
who tracked the development of the management discipline over several decades. His study 
used co-citation and network analysis to identify the theoretical perspectives that were 
dominant in each decade. 
 
Alternative type of paper is a focused paper with very specific research question. Typically, 
these papers will have small empirical bibliometric part that is used to illustrate or prove 
authors claims and extensive discussion of the relation of these claims with existing literature. 
An example of a focused question would be “Is research stream X over-reliant on theoretical 
perspective Y?” Researchers could then use citation analysis to prove that the research in field 
X is indeed highly influenced by the theoretical perspective Y and that references to other 
potentially useful theoretical perspectives are few or nonexistent. Other research goals could 
fall under this focus type. For instance, Volberda, Foss, & Lyles (2010) used bibliometric 
methods to investigate contextual factors that affect absorptive capacity and develop an 
integrative model that identifies the multilevel antecedents, process dimensions, and outcomes 
of absorptive capacity. 
 
4. The intellectual structure of Organizational Research Methods 
 
To demonstrate the use of bibliometric methods we performed a bibliometric analysis of the 
Organizational Research Methods journal. All steps necessary to reproduce this analysis are 
detailed in Appendix B. Readers can also repeat the analysis on their own data by following 
the steps with data of their chosen research field. 
 
We set out to examine the intellectual structure of the Organizational Research Methods 
(ORM) journal. Our expectation was that this investigation would reveal which research 
methods are dominant within organizational research. We decided to use citation and co-
citation analysis. With citation analysis we aimed to find the most influential documents 
(books or articles) that were referenced in ORM. Co-citation data provided the structure of the 
knowledge base of ORM. 
 
We searched the Web of Science database for “Organizational Research Methods” in the 
publication name. The search returned 483 articles, but the analysis based on publication 
years revealed that the data for 1999 and 2000 were missing so we decided to only use 
published articles from 2001 to 2014, covering almost 15 years. Limiting the search to that 
time period left us with 465 entries that formed the data sample for our analysis. 
 
We exported the bibliographic data with cited references for these 465 articles and imported it 
into BibExcel software for bibliometric analysis. We calculated the list of the most cited 
documents and the most cited journals in BibExcel. Having the list of the most cited journals 
we proceeded to clean the citation data as journal names often appear in different forms in 
bibliographic databases. We found four instances where the journal short name was 
duplicated and adjusted the citation counts accordingly. 
 


----- Page 23 (native text) -----
23 
Next step in the process was choosing the cut-off point to limit the number of documents for 
co-citation analysis. Co-citation is not performed on the core documents (i.e. the 465 articles 
published in ORM) but on the documents cited by these. Limiting the scope of documents for 
co-citation analysis is a judgment call which tries to balance two competing objectives: 
providing as broad a representation of the intellectual structure as possible vs. providing a 
more focused, clean representation. If we limit the articles too much (i.e. choose a citation 
cut-off point too high), we risk missing some smaller groups of publications that are perhaps 
less cited, but nevertheless important. If we set the cut-off point too low, we get another set of 
problems. Bigger groups of documents are harder to visualize. Less cited documents carry 
less information for co-citation analysis, which increases the probability for spurious co-
citation connections. After several trials with different cut-off points, we decided to limit our 
analysis to 112 documents cited 9 or more times by the articles published in the ORM journal.  
We calculated the co-citation data and exported it to the Pajek network analysis software for 
further analysis and visualization. Applying the Louvain community finding algorithm in 
Pajek, we found 11 subgroups of cited publications that represent the intellectual structure of 
the ORM journal. We visualized the networks in Pajek with the Kamada-Kawai algorithm. 
We report the results of our analysis in the following sections. 
 
4.1. Citation analysis 
 
The most cited documents by articles published in ORM are presented in Table 4. A glance at 
the list reveals the knowledge base of ORM and provides hints about the topical structure of 
ORM, which we will further investigate with co-citation analysis. The most cited document is 
Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences (Cohen, 1988), with 31 citations. The 
top of the list is dominated by books on psychometric theory, linear regression and multilevel 
analysis. We can see that some books appear in several editions, e.g. both 1978 and 1994 
editions of Nunnaly’s Psychometric Theory are featured on the list. Other works include 
seminal works on grounded theory, meta-analysis and structural equation modeling. Note that 
the way documents are represented in this table is the data that represents the reference list in 
the SSCI (WOS) database. 
 
The most cited journals in ORM are shown in Table 4. We see that the most cited journal is 
the Journal of Applied Psychology with 1,637 citations, almost twice as many as the second 
on the list, which is ORM. Perhaps surprisingly for a methods journal, most of the top of the 
list is taken up by top-tier management journals (Academy of Management Journal, Strategic 
Management Journal, Journal of Management), which is an indicator of the disciplinary 
breadth of ORM. Most numerous on the list, however, are psychology journals, meaning that 
methods for micro management (psychology, OB and HR) research are forming a large share 
of topics in ORM. 
 
4.2. Co-citation analysis 
 
After experimenting with several parameters for the Louvain algorithm that determine the 
granularity of groups, we settled on an 11-group solution. The algorithm originally found 15 
groups, but 4 groups contained only one element of non-methods origin – seminal works of 
Porter, Weick and DiMaggio – so we decided to treat these four groups as outliers and report 
only the first 11.

The first three groups of intellectual structure represent the knowledge base of multilevel 
research methods. We labeled these groups Multilevel theory (Figure 4), Interrater reliability 
and agreement (IRR & IRA) (Figure 5) and Multilevel analysis (Figure 6). The cohesion and 
breadth of these groups indicate that debates about multilevel methods are one of the most 
important themes in ORM.

The fourth group contains articles and books on Psychometric measurement theory and 
structural equation modeling (Figure 7). The group on Relative predictor importance (Figure 
8) is one of the smaller and deals with estimating the importance of predictors in multiple 
regression. This group is separated from one of the largest groups that deals with Multiple 
regression (Figure 9).

We labeled the subsequent groups Measurement invariance (Figure 10), Validity and method 
variance (Figure 11) and Qualitative research (Figure 12). The tenth group is peculiar because 
it shows two different topics: half of the groups contain debates about the relevance of 
Management theory, while the other half is dedicated to Meta-analysis (Figure 13). The 
eleventh group is the smallest with three items on the topic of Missing data (Figure 14).

What might be the conclusions from this brief analysis? High citations to psychology journals 
suggest methods issues in micro research are dominant in the conversations in the ORM, 
although the evidence from citation rates of Strategic Management Journal and some co-
citation groups reveal that ORM also caters to debates in macro fields (e.g. strategy).

Out of eleven groups, only one is about qualitative research, meaning that quantitative 
methods are still the bread and butter of organizational research. Quantitative conversations 
are mostly centered on either measurement or analysis problems, while theory issues are the

focus of two found groups. Most of our results are consistent with the content analysis of the 
first decade of ORM journal (Aguinis, Pierce, Bosco, & Muslin, 2009). However, our findings 
suggest that the importance of multilevel research methods has gained in prominence in the 
seven years since the end of the period analyzed by Aguinis and colleagues. Additionally, our 
analysis can be used as an aid for assigning readings in methods doctoral courses. We 
identified the most impactful methods publications that are used by the members of ORM 
community who expressed their opinions by citing these documents.

5. Conclusion 
 
Bibliometric methods reveal great potential for the quantitative confirmation of subjectively 
derived categories in published reviews as well as for exploring the research landscape and 
identifying the categories. We proposed guidelines for conducting the science mapping of 
management and organization research streams. 
 
Several new bibliometric methods are likely to become prominent in the future. Hybrid 
methods combining the existing bibliometric and semantic approaches (e.g. bibliographic 
coupling with latent semantic indexing) could be used to detect new emerging topics in 
scientific research (Glänzel & Thijs, 2012) and are rapidly becoming the preferred basis of the 
mapping and visualization of science (Thijs, Schiebel, & Glänzel, 2013). Connecting 
documents through a combination of bibliometric and second-order textual similarities can 
improve the accuracy of document clustering. Second-order similarities take the lexical 
content into account and can overcome problems of simple co-word methods like synonyms 
and spelling variances (e.g. British vs. American spelling of words). 
 
Topic modeling (Blei, 2012) is a family of content analysis methods that originates from 
machine learning. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is the most widely used topic modeling 
method that is able to decipher the topical structure of a large corpus of unstructured 
documents. It assigns the probability of topics to documents and determines which words are 
connected to particular topics. Topic modeling could be applied to document abstracts and 
full texts, which can be later connected based on their thematic similarity. These methods 
hold great potential for expanding the scope of mapping the management and organization 
domain. Management scholars can capitalize on these advances in two ways: they may wait 
for suitable software to be developed or collaborate with information scientists on the 
forefront of advancing bibliometric research.

We think that science mapping with bibliometric methods is useful in two main ways: (1) to 
help researchers new to a field quickly grasp the field’s structure; and (2) to introduce 
quantitative rigor into traditional literature reviews. We envision that in the future 
bibliometric methods will become the third major approach (in addition to traditional 
qualitative literature reviews and meta-analyses) used for reviewing scientific literature. 
However, new doctoral students need to be trained in the technique. Some doctoral programs 
already provide this, but further proliferation of this practice is called for. This paper 
represents our effort to promote these methods and provide a thorough introduction to 
bibliometric methods for researchers unfamiliar with them. 
 
We are aware that other bibliometric studies have been published in journals not listed by the 
SSCI or are simply unpublished. However, we included the highest quality journals so our 
synthesis represents the state of the art of bibliometric research in management and 
organization. One trend is obvious. The bar for publishing bibliometric studies is being raised 
higher. Bibliometric methods are transforming from being novel methods interesting in their 
own right to a tool used for a specific purpose; namely, to increase the rigor and structuring of 
literature reviews. Researchers applying bibliometric methods need to choose their research 
questions much more carefully and perform the research rigorously. 
 
Finally, bibliometric methods are no substitute for extensive reading and synthesis. 
Bibliometrics can reliably connect publications, authors or journals, identify research 
substreams, and produce maps of published research, but it is up to the researcher and their 
knowledge of the field to interpret the findings – which is the hard part.

Appendix A: Study selection and coding 
 
Falling within the scope of this paper are studies using bibliometric methods for mapping 
research fields or research topics in management and organization. Using Web of Science 
(WOS), a search query was made for the following terms: bibliometric* OR co-citation OR 
bibliographic coupling OR co-author OR co-word in the topic of the entry. The search 
returned 5,046 entries which were further filtered for publications in the management and 
business domain. We then read every abstract of the remaining 381 documents. We excluded 
those unrelated to the scope of our research. Documents in this phase were mainly excluded 
for the following reasons: 
‐ Studies conducted science mapping in fields unrelated to management or organization (e.g. 
nanotechnology). 
‐ A large number of documents were excluded because their main topic was measuring the 
productivity of researchers, organizations or systems/countries, which is outside the scope 
of our research. This research stream is more concerned with measuring the productivity of 
scientists and a comparison/ranking of various journals, research organizations or countries 
than with mapping the science. 
‐ Studies examined patents, not scientific publications; as such, they belonged to the domain 
of technological forecasting. 
‐ The keyword “co-author” in a number of articles referred just to a co-author without any 
connection to the bibliometric method of co-author analysis. 
 
After filtering the publications through the WOS online user interface, we downloaded the 
documents left in the set. Where articles were unavailable through our resources, we 
contacted the authors for the original manuscript. We were unable to retrieve three articles 
even after this step. Finally, we were left with 81 studies that constitute the publications in our 
data sample.

Once the list of publications had been compiled, all the manuscripts were carefully read and 
coded by one of the authors and a research assistant. Agreement ranged between 87.7% and 
100%. The differences were reconciled in a joint session where manuscripts in question were 
analyzed and solutions determined. The categories were determined by the two authors to 
cover the main aspects of the bibliometric analysis. Coders categorized the following: (a) 
which bibliometric methods were utilized; (b) whether the study used multiple time periods to 
track the evolution of the field through time; (c) how the selection was performed; (d) which 
database was used as source of bibliometric data; (e) which bibliometric software was used; 
(f) what was the unit of analysis; (g) which methods were applied to produce subgroups; (h) 
which visualization method was used; and (i) which visualization software was employed.

The intellectual structure of consumer research – a 
bibliometric study of author cocitations in the 1st 15 
years of the journal of consumer research 
 
Appendix B: Steps to reproduce the bibliometric analysis of the ORM journal 
 
1. Select and download data from the Web of Science website 
a. Go to WOS website apps.webofknowledge.com (subscription needed, often included in 
university library access) 
b. Select “Web of Science Core Collection” (this step is needed to be able to export cited 
references) 
c. Search for “Organizational Research Methods” in Publication Name 
d. Exclude publication year 1998 (since the years 1999 and 2000 are missing from Web of 
Science records we will perform the analysis on papers published since 2001) – 465 
records are left 
e. Export bibliometric data – Select “Save to Other File Formats”  
f. Choose record numbers from 1 to 465 (the WoS interface enables the export of up to 
500 records. If the search returns more than 500 records, each batch of 500 has to be 
exported separately: 1-500, 501-1000 etc. Files can be later combined in WordPad or 
another text processor.) 
g. Choose Record Content: “Full Record and Cited References” 
h. Choose File Format: “Plain Text” 
i. Click Send and save to file “orm.txt” 
 
2. Perform bibliometric analysis in BibExcel 
a. Open the file “orm.txt” in the BibExcel software 
b. File preprocessing (these steps are outlined in the BibExcel PowerPoint tutorial 
“Mapping science using Bibexcel and Pajek”

i. Replace line feeds with the carriage return – BibExcel->Edit doc-file->Replace line 
feed with carriage return 
ii. Convert to the Dialog format – BibExcel-> Misc->Convert to Dialog format-
>Convert from Web of Science 
iii. Process the cited references data into an intermediate .out file for co-citation 
analysis– Select “Any ; separated field” as the field to be analyzed, put “CD” into 
the Old tag field. Press the “Prep” button. 
iv. Process the author names to keep only the first initial BibExcel->Edit out-file-
>Keep only author’s first initial 
v. Process the cited references - BibExcel->Edit out-file->Convert Upper Lower 
Case->Good for Cited reference strings 
c. Perform citation analysis for journals, first authors and documents 
i. Get the top cited journals - BibExcel->Select type of unit “Cited journal”; Check the 
“Sort descending” option; press the Start button. 
ii. Save the file with the top cited journals - rename the “orm.cit” file “orm-
journal.cit”. 
iii. Clean the data for the top cited journals – add citation counts for journals that are 
represented with several different strings 
iv. Get the top cited documents - BibExcel->Select type of unit “Whole string”; press 
the Start button. 
v. Save the file with the top cited documents - rename the “orm.cit” file “orm-
document.cit”. 
vi. Clean the data for the top cited documents – add citation counts for documents that 
are represented with several different strings. 
d. Perform co-citation analysis with document as the unit of analysis. 
i. Establish the citation threshold on which to perform the co-citation analysis. We 
decided to establish the cut-off point at 9 citations, meaning we are doing co-
citation analysis on the top 112 cited documents. 
ii. Double-click on the orm.cit file; keep only the first 112 entries in the window “The 
List”. 
iii. Initiate co-citation frequency counts – first click on the orm.low file, then BibExcel-
>Analyze->Co-occurrence->Make pairs via listbox (first No, then OK). 
iv. Produce a square co-citation frequency matrix that will be later analyzed with PCA 
– Keep only the first 77 entries in the window “The List”; click on the orm.coc file; 
BibExcel->Analyze->Make a matrix for MDS etc. 
v. Open the square matrix “orm.ma2” file in Microsoft Excel, transpose the column 
headers to row labels (first column), save as “orm.csv”. 
vi. Export the co-citation network in the Pajek format, this can be later imported into 
any network analysis software – select the “orm.coc” file and choose BibExcel-
>Mapping->Create net-file for Pajek. 
 
3. Find subgroups and visualize the network in Pajek. 
a. Open file “orm.net” in Pajek – Pajek->Networks->Read network 
b. Implement Louvain algorithm to find subgroups – Pajek->Create Partition-
>Communities->Louvain Method->Multilevel Coarsening + Single Refinement 
(Resolution parameter = 1.5) 
c. Extract 
each 
subgroup 
into 
separate 
network 
– 
Pajek->Operations-
>Network+Partition->Extract Subnetwork 
d. Draw each subgroup as separate network – Pajek->Draw->Network 
e. Use Kamada-Kawai algorithm for network visualization – Pajek(drawing)->Layout-
>Energy->Kamada-Kawai->Free
