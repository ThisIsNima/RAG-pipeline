Summary
Each year, the American Heart Association (AHA), in conjunction with the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, and other government agencies, brings 
together the most up-to-date statistics on heart disease, stroke, other vascular diseases, and their 
risk factors and presents them in its Heart Disease and Stroke Statistical Update. The Statistical 
Update is a valuable resource for researchers, clinicians, healthcare policy makers, media 
professionals, the lay public, and many others who seek the best national data available on disease 
morbidity and mortality and the risks, quality of care, medical procedures and operations, and 
costs associated with the management of these diseases in a single document. Indeed, since 1999, 
the Statistical Update has been cited more than 8700 times in the literature (including citations of 
all annual versions). In 2009 alone, the various Statistical Updates were cited ≈1600 times (data 
from ISI Web of Science). In recent years, the Statistical Update has undergone some major 
changes with the addition of new chapters and major updates across multiple areas. For this year’s 
edition, the Statistics Committee, which produces the document for the AHA, updated all of the 
current chapters with the most recent nationally representative data and inclusion of relevant 
articles from the literature over the past year and added a new chapter detailing how family history 
and genetics play a role in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Also, the 2011 Statistical Update is 
a major source for monitoring both cardiovascular health and disease in the population, with a 
focus on progress toward achievement of the AHA’s 2020 Impact Goals. Below are a few 
highlights from this year’s Update.
•
The 2007 overall death rate from CVD (International Classification of Diseases 10, I00–
I99) was 251.2 per 100 000. The rates were 294.0 per 100 000 for white males, 405.9 per

black females. From 1997 to 2007, the death rate from CVD declined 27.8%. Mortality 
data for 2007 show that CVD (I00–I99; Q20–Q28) accounted for 33.6% (813 804) of all 
2 243 712 deaths in 2007, or 1 of every 2.9 deaths in the United States.
•
On the basis of 2007 mortality rate data, more than 2200 Americans die of CVD each 
day, an average of 1 death every 39 seconds. More than 150 000 Americans killed by 
CVD (I00–I99) in 2007 were <65 years of age. In 2007, nearly 33% of deaths due to 
CVD occurred before the age of 75 years, which is well before the average life 
expectancy of 77.9 years.
•
Coronary heart disease caused ≈1 of every 6 deaths in the United States in 2007. 
Coronary heart disease mortality in 2007 was 406 351. Each year, an estimated 785 000 
Americans will have a new coronary attack, and ≈470 000 will have a recurrent attack. It 
is estimated that an additional 195 000 silent first myocardial infarctions occur each year. 
Approximately every 25 seconds, an American will have a coronary event, and 
approximately every minute, someone will die of one.
•
Each year, ≈795 000 people experience a new or recurrent stroke. Approximately 610 
000 of these are first attacks, and 185 000 are recurrent attacks. Mortality data from 2007 
indicate that stroke accounted for ≈1 of every 18 deaths in the United States. On average, 
every 40 seconds, someone in the United States has a stroke. From 1997 to 2007, the 
stroke death rate fell 44.8%, and the actual number of stroke deaths declined 14.7%.
•
In 2007, 1 in 9 death certificates (277 193 deaths) in the United States mentioned heart 
failure.
•
Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005–2008 
indicate that 33.5% of US adults ≥20 years of age have hypertension (Table 7-1). This 
amounts to an estimated 76 400 000 US adults with hypertension. The prevalence of 
hypertension is nearly equal between men and women. African American adults have 
among the highest rates of hypertension in the world, at 44%. Among hypertensive 
adults, ≈80% are aware of their condition, 71% are using antihypertensive medication, 
and only 48% of those aware that they have hypertension have their condition controlled.
•
Despite 4 decades of progress, in 2008, among Americans ≥18 years of age, 23.1% of 
men and 18.3% of women continued to be cigarette smokers. In 2009, 19.5% of students 
in grades 9 through 12 reported current tobacco use. The percentage of the nonsmoking 
population with detectable serum cotinine (indicating exposure to secondhand smoke) 
was 46.4% in 1999 to 2004, with declines occurring, and was highest for those 4 to 11 
years of age (60.5%) and those 12 to 19 years of age (55.4%).
•
An estimated 33 600 000 adults ≥20 years of age have total serum cholesterol levels ≥240 
mg/dL, with a prevalence of 15.0% (Table 13-1).
•
In 2008, an estimated 18 300 000 Americans had diagnosed diabetes mellitus, 
representing 8.0% of the adult population. An additional 7 100 000 had undiagnosed 
diabetes mellitus, and 36.8% had prediabetes, with abnormal fasting glucose levels. 
African Americans, Mexican Americans, Hispanic/Latino individuals, and other ethnic 
minorities bear a strikingly disproportionate burden of diabetes mellitus in the United 
States (Table 16-1).

•
The estimated prevalence of overweight and obesity in US adults (≥20 years of age) is 
149 300 000, which represents 67.3% of this group in 2008. Fully 33.7% of US adults are 
obese (body mass index ≥30 kg/m2). Men and women of all race/ethnic groups in the 
population are affected by the epidemic of overweight and obesity (Table 15-1).
•
Among children 2 to 19 years of age, 31.9% are overweight and obese (which represents 
23 500 000 children), and 16.3% are obese (12 000 000 children). Mexican American 
boys and girls and African American girls are disproportionately affected. Over the past 3 
decades, the prevalence of obesity in children 6 to 11 years of age has increased from 
≈4% to more than 20%.
•
Obesity (body mass index ≥30 kg/m2) is associated with marked excess mortality in the 
US population. Even more notable is the excess morbidity associated with overweight 
and obesity in terms of risk factor development and incidence of diabetes mellitus, CVD 
end points (including coronary heart disease, stroke, and heart failure), and numerous 
other health conditions, including asthma, cancer, degenerative joint disease, and many 
others.
•
The prevalence of diabetes mellitus is increasing dramatically over time, in parallel with 
the increases in prevalence of overweight and obesity.
•
On the basis of NHANES 2003–2006 data, the age-adjusted prevalence of metabolic 
syndrome, a cluster of major cardiovascular risk factors related to overweight/obesity and 
insulin resistance, is 34% (35.1% among men and 32.6% among women).
•
The proportion of youth (≤18 years of age) who report engaging in no regular physical 
activity is high, and the proportion increases with age. In 2007, among adolescents in 
grades 9 through 12, 29.9% of girls and 17.0% of boys reported that they had not 
engaged in 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, defined as any activity 
that increased heart rate or breathing rate, even once in the previous 7 days, despite 
recommendations that children engage in such activity ≥5 days per week.
•
Thirty-six percent of adults reported engaging in no vigorous activity (activity that causes 
heavy sweating and a large increase in breathing or heart rate).
•
Data from NHANES indicate that between 1971 and 2004, average total energy 
consumption among US adults increased by 22% in women (from 1542 to 1886 kcal/d) 
and by 10% in men (from 2450 to 2693 kcal/d; see Chart 19-1).
•
The increases in calories consumed during this time period are attributable primarily to 
greater average carbohydrate intake, in particular, of starches, refined grains, and sugars. 
Other specific changes related to increased caloric intake in the United States include 
larger portion sizes, greater food quantity and calories per meal, and increased 
consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, snacks, commercially prepared (especially 
fast food) meals, and higher energy-density foods.

Procedure Utilization, and Costs—In light of the current national focus on healthcare 
utilization, costs, and quality, it is critical to monitor and understand the magnitude of healthcare

delivery and costs, as well as the quality of healthcare delivery, related to CVDs. The Update 
provides these critical data in several sections.
Quality-of-Care Metrics for CVDs—Chapter 20 reviews many metrics related to the quality of 
care delivered to patients with CVDs, as well as healthcare disparities. In particular, quality data 
are available from the AHA’s “Get With The Guidelines” programs for coronary artery disease 
and heart failure and the American Stroke Association/ AHA’s “Get With the Guidelines” 
program for acute stroke. Similar data from the Veterans Healthcare Administration, national 
Medicare and Medicaid data and National Cardiovascular Data Registry Acute Coronary 
Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network - “Get With The Guidelines” Registry data are 
also reviewed. These data show impressive adherence with guideline recommendations for many, 
but not all, metrics of quality of care for these hospitalized patients. Data are also reviewed on 
screening for cardiovascular risk factor levels and control.
Cardiovascular Procedure Utilization and Costs—Chapter 21 provides data on trends and 
current usage of cardiovascular surgical and invasive procedures. For example, the total number of 
inpatient cardiovascular operations and procedures increased 27%, from 5 382 000 in 1997 to 6 
846 000 in 2007 (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute computation based on National Center 
for Health Statistics annual data).
Chapter 22 reviews current estimates of direct and indirect healthcare costs related to CVDs, 
stroke, and related conditions using Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data. The total direct and 
indirect cost of CVD and stroke in the United States for 2007 is estimated to be $286 billion. This 
figure includes health expenditures (direct costs, which include the cost of physicians and other 
professionals, hospital services, prescribed medications, home health care, and other medical 
durables) and lost productivity resulting from mortality (indirect costs). By comparison, in 2008, 
the estimated cost of all cancer and benign neoplasms was $228 billion ($93 billion in direct costs, 
$19 billion in morbidity indirect costs, and $116 billion in mortality indirect costs). CVD costs 
more than any other diagnostic group.
The AHA, through its Statistics Committee, continuously monitors and evaluates sources of data 
on heart disease and stroke in the United States to provide the most current data available in the 
Statistics Update. The 2007 mortality data have been released. More information can be found at 
the National Center for Health Statistics Web site, http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr58/
nvsr58_01.pdf.
Finally, it must be noted that this annual Statistical Update is the product of an entire year’s worth 
of effort by dedicated professionals, volunteer physicians and scientists, and outstanding AHA 
staff members, without whom publication of this valuable resource would be impossible. Their 
contributions are gratefully acknowledged.

1. About These Statistics
The American Heart Association (AHA) works with the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention’s (CDC’s) National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS); the National Heart, 
Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI); the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and 
Stroke (NINDS); and other government agencies to derive the annual statistics in this 
Update. This chapter describes the most important sources and the types of data we use from 
them. For more details, see Chapter 24 of this document, the Glossary.

factor prevalence and nutrition statistics
•
National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)—disease and risk factor prevalence
•
National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS)—hospital inpatient discharges and 
procedures (discharged alive, dead, or status unknown)

Disease Prevalence
Prevalence is an estimate of how many people have a disease at a given point or period in 
time. The NCHS conducts health examination and health interview surveys that provide 
estimates of the prevalence of diseases and risk factors. In this Update, the health interview 
part of the NHANES is used for the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). 
NHANES is used more than the NHIS because in NHANES, angina pectoris (AP) is based 
on the Rose Questionnaire; estimates are made regularly for heart failure (HF); hypertension 
is based on blood pressure (BP) measurements and interviews; and an estimate can be made 
for total CVD, including myocardial infarction (MI), AP, HF, stroke, and hypertension.
A major emphasis of this Update is to present the latest estimates of the number of people in 
the United States who have specific conditions to provide a realistic estimate of burden. 
Most estimates based on NHANES prevalence rates are based on data collected from 2005 
to 2008 (in most cases, these are the latest published figure). These are applied to census 
population estimates for 2008. Differences in population estimates based on extrapolations 
of rates beyond the data collection period by use of more recent census population estimates 
cannot be used to evaluate possible trends in prevalence. Trends can only be evaluated by 
comparing prevalence rates estimated from surveys conducted in different years.
Risk Factor Prevalence
The NHANES 2005–2008 data are used in this Update to present estimates of the 
percentage of people with high lipid values, diabetes mellitus, overweight, and obesity. The 
NHIS is used for the prevalence of cigarette smoking and physical inactivity. Data for 
students in grades 9 through 12 are obtained from the YRBSS.
Incidence and Recurrent Attacks
An incidence rate refers to the number of new cases of a disease that develop in a population 
per unit of time. The unit of time for incidence is not necessarily 1 year, although we often 
discuss incidence in terms of 1 year. For some statistics, new and recurrent attacks or cases 
are combined. Our national incidence estimates for the various types of CVD are 
extrapolations to the US population from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), the 
Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, and the Cardiovascular Health Study 
(CHS), all conducted by the NHLBI, as well as the GCNKSS, which is funded by the 
NINDS. The rates change only when new data are available; they are not computed 
annually. Do not compare the incidence or the rates with those in past editions of the Heart 
Disease and Stroke Statistics Update (also known as the Heart and Stroke Statistical Update 
for editions before 2005). Doing so can lead to serious misinterpretation of time trends.
Mortality
Mortality data are presented according to the underlying cause of death. “Any-mention” 
mortality means that the condition was nominally selected as the underlying cause or was 
otherwise mentioned on the death certificate. For many deaths classified as attributable to 
CVD, selection of the single most likely underlying cause can be difficult when several 
major comorbidities are present, as is often the case in the elderly population. It is useful, 
therefore, to know the extent of mortality due to a given cause regardless of whether it is the

underlying cause or a contributing cause (ie, its “any-mention” status). The number of 
deaths in 2007 with any mention of specific causes of death was tabulated by the NHLBI 
from the NCHS public-use electronic files on mortality.
The first set of statistics for each disease in this Update includes the number of deaths for 
which the disease is the underlying cause. Two exceptions are Chapter 7 (High Blood 
Pressure) and Chapter 9 (Heart Failure). High BP, or hypertension, increases the mortality 
risks of CVD and other diseases, and HF should be selected as an underlying cause only 
when the true underlying cause is not known. In this Update, hypertension and HF death 
rates are presented in 2 ways: (1) as nominally classified as the underlying cause and (2) as 
any-mention mortality.
National and state mortality data presented according to the underlying cause of death were 
computed from the mortality tables of the NCHS World Wide Web site, the Health Data 
Interactive data system of the NCHS, or the CDC compressed mortality file. Any-mention 
numbers of deaths were tabulated from the electronic mortality files of the NCHS World 
Wide Web site and from Health Data Interactive.
Population Estimates
In this publication, we have used national population estimates from the US Census Bureau 
for 2008 in the computation of morbidity data. NCHS population estimates for 2007 were 
used in the computation of death rate data. The Census Bureau World Wide Web site1 
contains these data, as well as information on the file layout.
Hospital Discharges and Ambulatory Care Visits
Estimates of the numbers of hospital discharges and numbers of procedures performed are 
for inpatients discharged from short-stay hospitals. Discharges include those discharged 
alive, dead, or with unknown status. Unless otherwise specified, discharges are listed 
according to the first-listed (primary) diagnosis, and procedures are listed according to all 
listed procedures (primary plus secondary). These estimates are from the NHDS of the 
NCHS unless otherwise noted. Ambulatory care visit data include patient visits to physician 
offices and hospital outpatient departments (OPDs) and emergency departments (EDs). 
Ambulatory care visit data reflect the first-listed (primary) diagnosis. These estimates are 
from NAMCS and NHAMCS of the NCHS.
International Classification of Diseases
Morbidity (illness) and mortality (death) data in the United States have a standard 
classification system: the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). Approximately 
every 10 to 20 years, the ICD codes are revised to reflect changes over time in medical 
technology, diagnosis, or terminology. Where necessary for comparability of mortality 
trends across the 9th and 10th ICD revisions, comparability ratios computed by the NCHS 
are applied as noted.2 Effective with mortality data for 1999, we are using the 10th revision 
(ICD-10). It will be a few more years before the 10th revision is used for hospital discharge 
data and ambulatory care visit data, which are based on the International Classification of 
Diseases, Clinical Modification, 9th Revision (ICD-9-CM).3

Age Adjustment
Prevalence and mortality estimates for the United States or individual states comparing 
demographic groups or estimates over time either are age specific or are age adjusted to the 
2000 standard population by the direct method.4 International mortality data are age adjusted 
to the European standard.5 Unless otherwise stated, all death rates in this publication are age 
adjusted and are deaths per 100 000 population.
Data Years for National Estimates
In this Update, we estimate the annual number of new (incidence) and recurrent cases of a 
disease in the United States by extrapolating to the US population in 2008 from rates 
reported in a community- or hospital-based study or multiple studies. Age-adjusted 
incidence rates by sex and race are also given in this report as observed in the study or 
studies. For US mortality, most numbers and rates are for 2007. For disease and risk factor 
prevalence, most rates in this report are calculated from the 2005–2008 NHANES. Rates by 
age and sex are also applied to the US population in 2008 to estimate the numbers of people 
with the disease or risk factor in that year. Because NHANES is conducted only in the 
noninstitutionalized population, we extrapolated the rates to the total US population in 2008, 
recognizing that this probably underestimates the total prevalence, given the relatively high 
prevalence in the institutionalized population. The numbers and rates of hospital inpatient 
discharges for the United States are for 2007. Numbers of visits to physician offices, 
hospital EDs, and hospital OPDs are for 2007. Except as noted, economic cost estimates are 
for 2007.
Cardiovascular Disease
For data on hospitalizations, physician office visits, and mortality, CVD is defined according 
to ICD codes given in Chapter 24 of the present document. This definition includes all 
diseases of the circulatory system, as well as congenital CVD. Unless so specified, an 
estimate for total CVD does not include congenital CVD. Prevalence of CVD includes 
people with hypertension, heart disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease, and diseases of the 
veins.
Race
Data published by governmental agencies for some racial groups are considered unreliable 
because of the small sample size in the studies. Because we try to provide data for as many 
racial groups as possible, we show these data for informational and comparative purposes.

After achieving its major Impact Goals for 2010, the AHA recently created a new set of 
Impact Goals for the current decade.1 Specifically, the AHA committed to the following 
organizational goals:
By 2020, to improve the cardiovascular health of all Americans by 20%, while 
reducing deaths from cardiovascular disease and stroke by 20%.1

These goals include a novel concept, “cardiovascular health,” which encompasses 7 health 
behaviors and health factors (Table 2-1). “Ideal cardiovascular health” is defined by the 
absence of clinically manifest cardiovascular disease (CVD) and the simultaneous presence 
of optimal levels of all 7 health behaviors (lean body mass, avoidance of smoking, 
participation in physical activity, and healthy dietary intake consistent with a Dietary 
Approaches to Stop Hypertension [DASH]-like eating pattern) and health factors (untreated 
total cholesterol <200 mg/dL, untreated blood pressure <120/<80 mm Hg, and fasting blood 
glucose <100 mg/dL). Because the ideal cardiovascular health profile is known to be rare in 
the population, the entire spectrum of cardiovascular health can also be represented as being 
“ideal,” “intermediate,” or “poor” for each of the health behaviors and health factors, as 
shown in Table 2-1.1
Beginning in 2011, and recognizing the substantial time lag in the nationally representative 
data sets, the annual Statistical Update will begin to evaluate and publish metrics and 
information that gives AHA directional insights into progress and/or areas critical for greater 
concentration, to meet their 2020 goals. In this chapter, baseline data are presented that were 
derived from the existing national data available on January 20, 2010, the official 
announcement date of the 2020 Impact Goals.
Cardiovascular Health
•
Table 2-1 provides the specific definitions for ideal, intermediate, and poor 
cardiovascular health for each of the 7 health behaviors and health factors.
•
The prevalences of ideal, intermediate, and poor levels of each of the 7 
cardiovascular health metrics are shown in Chart 2-1 (for children) and Chart 2-2 
(for adults).
—
Among children (Chart 2-1), the prevalence (unadjusted) of ideal levels 
of cardiovascular health behaviors and factors currently varies from 0% 
for the healthy diet score (ie, essentially no children meet 4 or 5 of the 5 
dietary components) to more than 80% for the smoking and fasting 
glucose metrics. More than 90% of US children meet 0 or only 1 of the 5 
healthy dietary components.
—
Among US adults (Chart 2-2), the age-standardized prevalence of ideal 
levels of cardiovascular health behaviors and factors currently varies from 
0.2% for the healthy diet score up to 72% for the smoking metric (ie, 72% 
of US adults have never smoked or are current nonsmokers who have quit 
for more than 12 months).
—
In general, the prevalence of ideal levels of health behaviors and health 
factors is higher in US children than in US adults.
•
Age-standardized and age-specific prevalence estimates for Ideal Cardiovascular 
Health and for ideal levels of each of its components are shown in Table 2-2.
•
Chart 2-3 displays the prevalence estimates for the population of US children 
meeting different numbers of criteria for Ideal Cardiovascular Health (out of 7 
possible).

—
Half of US children ages 12 to 19 years meet 4 or fewer criteria for Ideal 
Cardiovascular Health.
—
The distributions are similar in boys and girls.
•
Charts 2-4 and 2-5 display the age-standardized prevalence estimates for the 
population of US adults meeting different numbers of criteria for Ideal 
Cardiovascular Health (out of 7 possible), overall, and stratified by age groups, sex, 
and race.
—
Approximately 3% of US adults have 0 of the 7 criteria at ideal levels, 
with ≈26% having 3 at ideal levels (Chart 2-4).
—
Compared with younger adults, older adults tend to have fewer of the 7 
metrics at ideal levels; more than half of those over age 60 years have 
only 2 or fewer at ideal levels (Chart 2-4).
—
Women tend to have more metrics at ideal levels than do men (Chart 
2-4).
—
Approximately 61% of white adults and 71% of black and Mexican 
American adults have 3 or fewer metrics (out of 7) at ideal levels (Chart 
2-5).
•
Chart 2-6 displays the age-standardized percentages of US adults and percentages 
of children who have 5 or more of the metrics (out of 7 possible) at ideal levels.
—
Almost 50% of US children aged 12 to 19 years have 5 or more metrics at 
ideal levels, including somewhat more boys than girls.
—
However, only 17% of US adults have 5 or more metrics with ideal 
levels, including 11% of men and 24% of women.
—
Whites have approximately twice the percentage of adults with 5 or more 
metrics with ideal levels, compared with Mexican Americans.
Cardiovascular Disease
•
In 2006 (baseline data for the 2020 Impact Goals on CVD and stroke mortality), 
age-standardized death rate from all CVDs was 262.5 per 100 000 (Chart 2-7).
—
Death rates from stroke, heart diseases and other cardiovascular causes 
were 43.6, 200.2, and 53.9 per 100 000, respectively.2
•
Data from NHANES 1999–2006 reveal that, overall, 8.1% of Americans self-
reported having some type of CVD (Table 2-3).
•
Among those with CVD, risk factor prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control 
were variable (Table 2-3).
—
Nearly 37% were current smokers or had quit for less than 12 months.
—
Awareness and treatment of hypertension were ≈80%, but only two-
thirds of those who were treated were controlled to goal levels.

—
Awareness and treatment of hypercholesterolemia were 60% and 68%, 
respectively, and 80% of treated individuals were at goal cholesterol 
levels.
—
More than three fourths were overweight or obese, and 45% were obese.
—
18% had diabetes mellitus.
—
45% participated in no physical activity.
—
100% of those with CVD met 3 or fewer of the 5 components of the 
healthy diet score.
Implications
•
Taken together, these baseline data indicate the substantial progress that will need 
to occur for the AHA to achieve its 2020 Impact Goals over the next decade.
—
To achieve improvements in cardiovascular health, all segments of the 
population will need to focus on improved cardiovascular health 
behaviors, in particular, with regard to diet and weight, as well as on an 
increase in physical activity and further reduction of the prevalence of 
smoking.
—
More children, adolescents, and young adults will need to learn how to 
preserve their ideal levels of cardiovascular health factors and health 
behaviors into older ages.
—
With regard to reducing the burden of CVD and stroke morbidity and 
mortality, renewed emphasis will be needed on treatment of acute events 
as well as secondary and primary prevention through treatment and 
control of risk factors.
•
Future issues of the Statistical Update will track progress toward these goals.

Prevalence
An estimated 82 600 000 American adults (>1 in 3) have 1 or more types of CVD. Of these, 
40 400 000 are estimated to be ≥60 years of age. Total CVD includes diseases listed in the

Among whites only, 11.9% have heart disease (HD), 6.4% have CHD, 23.0% have 
hypertension, and 2.5% have had a stroke.
•
Among blacks or African Americans, 11.2% have HD, 6.7% have CHD, 32.2% 
have hypertension, and 3.8% have had a stroke.
•
Among Hispanics or Latinos, 8.5% have HD, 5.8% have CHD, 21.5% have 
hypertension, and 2.0% have had a stroke.
•
Among Asians, 6.3% have HD, 3.9% have CHD, 19.4% have hypertension, and 
1.3% have had a stroke.
•
Among American Indians or Alaska Natives, 8.0% have HD, 4.1% (figure 
considered unreliable) have CHD, and 21.8% have hypertension. An estimate for 
stroke is not reported because of its large relative standard error.
•
Among Native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders, HD, CHD, and stroke numbers 
are not reported because of large relative standard errors; 22.0% have hypertension, 
but the figure is considered unreliable.
•
Asian Indian adults (9%) are ≈2-fold more likely than Korean adults (4%) to have 
ever been told they have HD, based on data for 2004 to 2006.2
Incidence
On the basis of the NHLBI’s FHS original and offspring cohort data from 1980 to 
20033:
—
The average annual rates of first cardiovascular events rise from 3 per 1000 
men at 35 to 44 years of age to 74 per 1000 men at 85 to 94 years of age. For 
women, comparable rates occur 10 years later in life. The gap narrows with 
advancing age.
—
Before 75 years of age, a higher proportion of CVD events due to CHD occur 
in men than in women, and a higher proportion of events due to stroke occur 
in women than in men.
Among American Indian men 45 to 74 years of age, the incidence of CVD ranges from 
15 to 28 per 1000 population. Among women, it ranges from 9 to 15 per 1000.4
Data from the FHS indicate that the subsequent lifetime risk for all CVD in recipients 
starting free of known disease is 2 in 3 for men and >1 in 2 for women at 40 years of 
age (personal communication, Donald Lloyd-Jones, MD, Northwestern University, 
Chicago, Ill) (see Table 3-4).
Analysis of FHS data among participants free of CVD at 50 years of age showed the 
lifetime risk for developing CVD was 51.7% for men and 39.2% for women. Median 
overall survival was 30 years for men and 36 years for women.5
Mortality
ICD-10 I00 –I99, Q20–Q28 for CVD (CVD mortality includes congenital cardiovascular 
defects); C00–C97 for cancer; C33–C34 for lung cancer; C50 for breast cancer; J40–J47

for chronic lower respiratory disease (CLRD); G30 for Alzheimer disease; E10–E14 for 
diabetes mellitus (DM); and V01–X59, Y85–Y86 for accidents.
•
Mortality data show that CVD (I00 –I99, Q20–Q28) as the underlying cause of 
death (including congenital cardiovascular defects) accounted for 33.6% (813 804) 
of all 2 423 712 deaths in 2007, or 1 of every 3 deaths in the United States. CVD 
any-mentions (1 342 314 deaths in 2007) constituted 55.4% of all deaths that year 
(NHLBI; NCHS public-use data files).6 The 2007 death rate was 251.2 (excluding 
congenital cardiovascular defects) (NCHS).6 In every year since 1900 except 1918, 
CVD accounted for more deaths than any other major cause of death in the United 
States.7–10
•
On average, >2200 Americans die of CVD each day, an average of 1 death every 
39 seconds. CVD claims more lives each year than cancer, CLRD, and accidents 
combined.6
•
The 2007 overall death rate due to CVD (I00 –I99) was 251.2. The rates were 
294.0 for white males, 405.9 for black males, 205.7 for white females, and 286.1 
for black females. From 1997 to 2007, death rates due to CVD (ICD-10 I00 –I99) 
declined 27.8%. In the same 10-year period, the actual number of CVD deaths per 
year declined 14.2% (NHLBI tabulation).6 (Appropriate comparability ratios were 
applied.)
•
Among other causes of death in 2007, cancer caused 562 875 deaths; accidents, 123 
706; Alzheimer disease, 74 632; and HIV/AIDS, 11 295.6
•
The 2007 CVD (I00 –I99) death rates were 300.3 for males and 211.6 for females. 
Death rates for cancer (malignant neoplasms) were 217.5 for males and 151.3 for 
females. Breast cancer claimed the lives of 40 599 females in 2007; lung cancer 
claimed 70 388. Death rates for females were 22.9 for breast cancer and 40.0 for 
lung cancer. One in 30 deaths in females was due to breast cancer, whereas 1 in 6.4 
was due to CHD. For comparison, 1 in 4.5 females died of cancer, whereas 1 in 2.9 
died of CVD (I00 –I99, Q20–Q28). On the basis of 2007 mortality data, CVD 
caused ≈1 death per minute among females, or 421 918 deaths in females in 2007. 
That represents more female lives than were claimed by cancer, CLRD, Alzheimer 
disease, and accidents combined (unpublished NHLBI tabulation).6
•
More than 150 000 Americans died of CVD (I00 –I99) in 2007 who were <65 years 
of age, and nearly 33% of deaths owing to CVD occurred before the age of 75 
years, which is well before the average life expectancy of 77.9 years.6
•
In 2007, death rates for diseases of the heart in American Indians or Alaska Natives 
were 159.8 for males and 99.8 for females; for Asians or Pacific Islanders, they 
were 126.0 for males and 82.0 for females; and for Hispanics or Latinos, they were 
165.0 for males and 111.8 for females.7
•
According to the NCHS, if all forms of major CVD were eliminated, life 
expectancy would rise by almost 7 years. If all forms of cancer were eliminated, the 
estimated gain would be 3 years. According to the same study, the probability at

birth of eventually dying of major CVD (I00 –I78) is 47%, and the chance of dying 
of cancer is 22%. Additional probabilities are 3% for accidents, 2% for DM, and 
0.7% for HIV.11
•
In 2007, the leading causes of death in women ≥65 years of age were diseases of 
the heart (No. 1), cancer (No. 2), stroke (No. 3), and CLRD (No. 4). In older men, 
they were diseases of the heart (No. 1), cancer (No. 2), CLRD (No. 3), and stroke 
(No. 4).6,10
•
A study of the decrease in US deaths due to CHD from 1980 to 2000 suggests that 
≈47% of the decrease was attributable to increased use of evidence-based medical 
therapies and 44% to changes in risk factors in the population due to lifestyle and 
environmental changes.12
•
Analysis of data from NCHS was used to determine the number of disease-specific 
deaths attributable to all non-optimal levels of each risk factor exposure, by age and 
sex. In 2005, tobacco smoking and high BP were estimated to be responsible for 
467 000 deaths, accounting for ≈1 in 5 or 6 deaths among US adults. Overweight/
obesity and physical inactivity were each estimated to be responsible for nearly 1 in 
10 deaths. High dietary salt, low dietary omega-3 fatty acids, and high dietary trans 
fatty acids were the dietary risks with the largest estimated mortality effects.13
Aftermath
•
Among an estimated 45 million people with functional disabilities in the United 
States, HD, stroke, and hypertension are among the 15 leading conditions that 
caused those disabilities. Disabilities were defined as difficulty with activities of 
daily living or instrumental activities of daily living, specific functional limitations 
(except vision, hearing, or speech), and limitation in ability to do housework or 
work at a job or business.14
Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
There is a wide variation in the reported incidence of and outcome for out-of-hospital 
cardiac arrest. These differences are due in part to differences in definition and 
ascertainment of cardiac arrest data, as well as differences in treatment after the onset of 
cardiac arrest. Cardiac arrest is defined as cessation of cardiac mechanical activity and is 
confirmed by the absence of signs of circulation.15
•
Extrapolation of the mortality rate observed in the Resuscitation Outcomes 
Consortium (ROC) to the total population of the United States suggests that each 
year, there are 295 000 (quasi confidence intervals 236 000 to 325 000) emergency 
medical services (EMS)-assessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in the United 
States.16
•
≈60% of out-of-hospital cardiac deaths are treated by EMS personnel.17
•
Only 33% of those with EMS-treated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest have symptoms 
within 1 hour of death.18

•
Among EMS-treated out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, 23% have an initial rhythm of 
ventricular fibrillation (VF), ventricular tachycardia (VT), or are shockable by 
automated external defibrillator (AED); 31% receive bystander cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation (CPR).16
•
The incidence of cardiac arrest with an initial rhythm of VF is decreasing over 
time; however, the incidence of cardiac arrest with any initial rhythm is not 
decreasing.19
•
Among ROC sites between December 2005 and May 2007, 32.0% of out-of-
hospital cardiac arrests received layresponder CPR and only 2.1% had an AED 
applied before EMS arrival. Overall chance of surviving until hospital discharge 
was 7%, and AED application was associated with a moderately increased odds of 
survival.20
•
If bystander CPR is not provided, a sudden cardiac arrest victim’s chances of 
survival fall 7% to 10% for every minute of delay until defibrillation.21–25
•
The median survival rate to hospital discharge after EMS-treated out-of-hospital 
cardiac arrest with any first recorded rhythm is 7.9%.16
•
The median survival rate after VF is 21%.16
•
Extrapolation of data from ARIC, CHS, and Framingham suggests that there are 
125 000 CHD deaths within 1 hour of symptom onset (NHLBI, written 
communication, July 13, 2010).
•
A study conducted in New York City found the age-adjusted incidence of out-of-
hospital cardiac arrest per 10 000 adults was 10.1 among blacks, 6.5 among 
Hispanics, and 5.8 among whites. The age-adjusted survival to 30 days after 
discharge was more than twice as poor for blacks as for whites, and survival among 
Hispanics was also lower than among whites.26
•
In a systematic review of literature through 2008, the factors most correlated with 
survival to hospital discharge following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were witness 
by a bystander, witness by EMS, receipt of bystander CPR, being found in VF or 
VT, and achieving return of spontaneous circulation.27
Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: Children
•
The reported incidence of out-of-hospital pediatric cardiac arrest varies widely (≈8 
per 100 000).28
•
There are >74 million individuals <18 years of age in the United States29; this 
implies that there are about 5920 pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrests annually 
of all causes (including trauma, sudden infant death syndrome, respiratory causes, 
cardiovascular causes, and submersion).
•
Seven percent of EMS-treated pediatric cardiac arrest patients had an initial rhythm 
of VF, VT, or were shockable by AED; 35% received bystander CPR.28

•
Studies that document voluntary reports of deaths among high school athletes 
suggest that the incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ranges from 0.28 to 1.0 
deaths per 100 000 high school athletes annually nationwide.30,31 Although 
incomplete, these numbers provide a basis for estimating the number of deaths in 
this age range.
•
One report describes the incidence of nontraumatic pediatric cardiac arrest (among 
students 3 to 18 years of age) that occurs in schools and estimates rates (per 100 
000 person-school-years) for elementary, middle, and high schools to be 0.18, 0.19, 
and 0.15, respectively, for the geographic area (King County, WA) and time frame 
(January 1, 1990, to December 31, 2005) studied.32
•
The reported average rate of survival to hospital discharge after pediatric out-of-
hospital cardiac arrest is 6%.
•
Most sudden deaths in athletes were attributable to CVD (56%). Of the 
cardiovascular deaths that occurred, 29% occurred in blacks, 54% in high school 
students, and 82% with physical exertion during competition/training, and only 
11% occurred in females, although this proportion has increased over time.33
In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
•
A total of 287 facilities reported 18 817 events to the National Registry for 
Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation during 2009.
—
The rates of survival to discharge after in-hospital cardiac arrest were 
33% among children and 21% among adults. Of these, 95% were 
monitored or witnessed.
—
Eighteen percent had VF or pulseless VT as the first recorded rhythm. Of 
these, 43% survived to discharge.

Seventy-nine percent of the lay public are confident that they know what actions to 
take in a medical emergency; 98% recognize an AED as something that administers 
an electric shock to restore a normal heart beat among victims of sudden cardiac 
arrest; and 60% are familiar with CPR (Harris Interactive survey conducted on 
behalf of the AHA among 1132 US residents 18 years of age and older, January 8, 
2008, through January 21, 2008).
Awareness of Warning Signs and Risk Factors for CVD
•
Surveys conducted by the AHA in 1997, 2000, 2003, and 2006 to evaluate trends in 
women’s awareness, knowledge, and perceptions related to CVD found that, in 
2006, awareness of HD as the leading cause of death among women was 57%, 
significantly higher than in prior surveys. Awareness was lower among black and 
Hispanic women than among white women, and the racial/ethnic difference has not 
changed appreciably over time. In 2006, more than twice as many women felt 
uninformed about stroke compared with HD. Hispanic women were more likely

than white women to report that there is nothing they can do to keep themselves 
from getting CVD. The majority of respondents reported confusion related to basic 
CVD prevention strategies.34
•
A nationally representative sample of women responded to a questionnaire about 
history of CVD risk factors, self-reported actions taken to reduce risk, and barriers 
to heart health. According to the study, published in 2006, the rate of awareness of 
CVD as the leading cause of death had nearly doubled since 1997, was 
significantly greater for whites than for blacks and Hispanics, and was 
independently correlated with increased physical activity (PA) and weight loss in 
the previous year. Fewer than half of the respondents were aware of healthy levels 
of risk factors. Awareness that their personal level was not healthy was positively 
associated with preventive action. Most women took steps to lower risk in family 
members and themselves.35
•
A total of 875 students in 4 Michigan high schools were given a survey to obtain 
data on the perception of risk factors and other knowledge-based assessment 
questions about CVD. Accidents were rated as the greatest perceived lifetime 
health risk (39%). Nearly 17% selected CVD as the greatest lifetime risk, which 
made it the third most popular choice after accidents and cancer. When asked to 
identify the greatest cause of death for each sex, 42% correctly recognized CVD for 
men, and 14% correctly recognized CVD for women; 40% incorrectly chose 
abuse/use behavior with a substance other than cigarettes as the most important 
CVD risk behavior.36
Risk Factors
•
Data from the 2003 CDC BRFSS survey of adults ≥18 years of age showed the 
prevalence of respondents who reported having ≥2 risk factors for HD and stroke 
was successively higher at higher age groups. The prevalence of having ≥2 risk 
factors was highest among blacks (48.7%) and American Indians/Alaska Natives 
(46.7%) and lowest among Asians (25.9%); prevalence was similar in women 
(36.4%) and men (37.8%). The prevalence of multiple risk factors ranged from 
25.9% among college graduates to 52.5% among those with less than a high school 
diploma (or its equivalent). People reporting household income of ≥$50 000 had 
the lowest prevalence (28.8%), and those reporting household income of $10 000 
had the highest prevalence (52.5%). Adults who reported being unable to work had 
the highest prevalence (69.3%) of ≥2 risk factors, followed by retired people 
(45.1%), unemployed adults (43.4%), homemakers (34.3%), and employed people 
(34.0%). Prevalence of ≥2 risk factors varied by state/territory and ranged from 
27.0% (Hawaii) to 46.2% (Kentucky). Twelve states and 2 territories had a 
multiple-risk-factor prevalence of ≥40%: Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana, 
Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, 
West Virginia, Guam, and Puerto Rico.37
•
Data from the Chicago Heart Association Detection Project (1967 to 1973, with an 
average follow-up of 31 years) showed that in younger women (18 to 39 years of 
age) with favorable levels for all 5 major risk factors (BP, serum cholesterol, body

mass index [BMI], DM, and smoking), future incidence of CHD and CVD is rare, 
and long-term and all-cause mortality are much lower than for those who have 
unfavorable or elevated risk factor levels at young ages. Similar findings applied to 
men in this study.38,39
•
Analysis of several data sets by the CDC showed that in adults ≥18 years of age, 
disparities were common in all risk factors examined. In men, the highest 
prevalence of obesity (29.7%) was found in Mexican Americans who had 
completed a high school education. Black women with or without a high school 
education had a high prevalence of obesity (48.4%). Hypertension prevalence was 
high among blacks (41.2%) regardless of sex or educational status. 
Hypercholesterolemia was high among white and Mexican American men and 
white women regardless of educational status. CHD and stroke were inversely 
related to education, income, and poverty status. Hospitalization for total HD and 
acute MI was greater among men, but hospitalization for congestive heart failure 
(CHF) and stroke was greater among women. Among Medicare enrollees, CHF 
hospitalization was higher in blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians/Alaska 
Natives than among whites, and stroke hospitalization was highest in blacks. 
Hospitalizations for CHF and stroke were highest in the southeastern United States. 
Life expectancy remains higher in women than in men and in whites than in blacks 
by ≈5 years. CVD mortality at all ages tended to be highest in blacks.40
•
Analysis of 5 cross-sectional, nationally representative surveys from the National 
Health Examination Survey (NHES) 1960–1962 to the NHANES 1999–2000 
showed that the prevalence of key risk factors (ie, high cholesterol, HBP, current 
smoking, and total DM) decreased over time across all BMI groups, with the 
greatest reductions observed among overweight and obese groups. Total DM 
prevalence was stable within BMI groups over time; however, the trend has leveled 
off or been reversed for some of the risk factors in more recent years.41
•
Data from BRFSS 2006–2008 demonstrated that during this 3-year period, 25.6% 
of non-Hispanic blacks, non-Hispanic whites, and Hispanics were obese, but 
prevalent obesity varied across groups: 35.7% for non-Hispanic blacks, 28.7% for 
Hispanics, and 23.7% for non-Hispanic whites.
•
Data from NHANES 2005–2006 showed that only 9.6% of US adults met their 
recommended target of daily dietary sodium intake.42
•
Analysis of >14 000 middle-aged subjects in the ARIC study sponsored by the 
NHLBI showed that >90% of CVD events in black subjects, compared with ≈70% 
in white subjects, appeared to be explained by elevated or borderline risk factors. 
Furthermore, the prevalence of participants with elevated risk factors was higher in 
black subjects; after accounting for education and known CVD risk factors, the 
incidence of CVD was identical in black and white subjects. Thus, the observed 
higher CVD incidence rate in black subjects appears to be largely attributable to a 
greater prevalence of elevated risk factors. These results suggest that the primary 
prevention of elevated risk factors might substantially impact the future incidence

of CVD, and these beneficial effects would likely be applicable not only for white 
but also for black subjects.43
•
Data from the MEPS 2004 Full-Year Data File showed that nearly 26 million US 
adults ≥18 years of age were told by a doctor that they had HD, stroke, or any other 
heart-related disease44:
—
56.6% of those surveyed said they engaged in moderate-to-vigorous PA 3 
times per week; 57.9% of those surveyed who had not been told they had 
HD engaged in regular PA, more than those who had been told they had 
HD (46.3%).
—
38.6% maintained a healthy weight. Among those told that they had HD, 
33.9% had a healthy weight compared with 39.3% who had never been 
told they had HD.
—
78.8% did not currently smoke. Among those ever told that they had 
indicators of HD, 18.3% continued to smoke.
—
More than 93% engaged in at least 1 recommended behavior for 
prevention of HD: 75.5% engaged in 1 or 2; 18% engaged in all 3; and 
6.5% did not engage in any of the recommended behaviors.
—
Age-based variations:
◦
Moderate to vigorous PA ≥3 times per week varied according to 
age. Younger people (18 to 44 years of age) were more likely 
(59.9%) than those who were older (45 to 64 and ≥65 years of 
age, 55.3% and 48.5%, respectively) to engage in regular PA.
◦
A greater percentage of those 18 to 44 years of age had a 
healthy weight (43.7%) than did those 45 to 64 years of age and 
≥65 years of age (31.4% and 37.3%, respectively).
◦
People ≥65 years of age were more likely to be current 
nonsmokers (89.7%) than were people 18 to 44 years of age and 
45 to 64 years of age (76.1% and 77.7%, respectively).
— Race/ethnicity-based variations:
◦
Non-Hispanic whites were more likely than Hispanics or non-Hispanic 
blacks to engage in moderate-to-vigorous PA (58.5% versus 51.4% and 
52.5%, respectively).
◦
Non-Hispanic whites were more likely to have maintained a healthy 
weight than were Hispanics or non-Hispanic blacks (39.8% versus 
32.1% and 29.7%, respectively).
◦
Hispanics were more likely to be nonsmokers (84.2%) than were non-
Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks (77.8% and 76.3%, 
respectively).

Variations based on education level:
◦
A greater percentage of adults with at least some college 
education engaged in moderate-to-vigorous PA ≥3 times per 
week (60.8%) than did those with a high school education or 
less than a high school education (55.3% and 48.3%, 
respectively).

A greater percentage of adults with at least some college 
education had a healthy weight (41.2%) than did those with a 
high school or less than high school education (36.2% and

There was a greater percentage of nonsmokers among those 
with a college education (85.5%) than among those with a high

•
Participants (18 to 64 years of age at baseline) in the Chicago Heart Association 
Detection Project in Industry without a history of MI were investigated to 
determine whether traditional CVD risk factors were similarly associated with 
CVD mortality in black and white men and women. In general, the magnitude and 
direction of associations were similar by race. Most traditional risk factors 
demonstrated similar associations with mortality in black and white adults of the 
same sex. Small differences were primarily in the strength and not the direction of 
the association.45
•
A study of nearly 1500 participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis 
(MESA) study found that Hispanics with hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, 
and/or DM who speak Spanish at home and/or have spent less than half a year in 
the United States have higher systolic BP, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) 
cholesterol, and fasting blood glucose, respectively, than Hispanics who speak 
English and who have lived a longer period of time in the United States.46
Family History of Premature-Onset CVD
•
There is consistent evidence from multiple large-scale prospective epidemiology 
studies for a strong and significant association of a reported family history of 
premature parental CHD with incident MI or CHD in offspring. In the FHS, the 
occurrence of a validated premature atherosclerotic CVD event in either a parent47

or a sibling48 was associated with an ≈2-fold elevated risk for CVD, independent 
of other traditional risk factors.
•
Addition of family history of premature CVD to a model that contained traditional 
risk factors provided modestly improved prognostic value in the FHS.47 Family 
history of premature MI is also an independent risk factor in other multivariable 
risk models that contain traditional risk factors in large cohorts of women50 and 
men.50
•
Parental history of premature CHD is associated with increased burden of 
atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries and the abdominal aorta.51,52
•
In the FHS, a parental history of validated HF is associated with a 1.7-fold higher 
risk of HF in offspring, after multivariable adjustment.53
•
A family history of early-onset sudden cardiac death in a first-degree relative is 
associated with a >2-fold higher risk for sudden cardiac death in offspring on the 
basis of available case-control studies.54
•
The 2004 HealthStyles survey of 4345 people in the United States indicated that 
most respondents believe that knowing their family history is important for their 
own health, but few are aware of the specific health information from relatives 
necessary to develop a family history.55
•
An accurate and complete family history may identify rare mendelian conditions 
such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, long-QT syndrome, or familial 
hypercholesterolemia. However, in most people with a family history of a CVD 
event, a known rare mendelian condition is not identified.
•
Studies are under way to determine genetic variants that may help identify people 
at increased risk of CVD.
Impact of Healthy Lifestyle and Low Risk Factor Levels
Much of the literature on CVD has focused on factors associated with increasing risk for 
CVD and on factors associated with poorer outcomes in the presence of CVD; however, in 
recent years, a number of studies have defined the potential beneficial effects of healthy 
lifestyle factors and lower CVD risk factor burden on CVD outcomes and longevity. These 
studies suggest that prevention of risk factor development at younger ages may be the key to 
“successful aging,” and they highlight the need for intensive prevention efforts at younger 
and middle ages once risk factors develop to increase the likelihood of healthy longevity.
•
The lifetime risk for CVD and median survival were highly associated with risk 
factor presence and burden at 50 years of age among >7900 men and women from 
the FHS followed up for 111 000 person-years. In this study, optimal risk factor 
burden at 50 years of age was defined as BP <120/ 80 mm Hg, total cholesterol 
<180 mg/dL, absence of DM, and absence of smoking. Elevated risk factors were 
defined as stage 1 hypertension or borderline high cholesterol (200 to 239 mg/dL). 
Major risk factors were defined as stage 2 hypertension, elevated cholesterol (≥240 
mg/dL), current smoking, and DM. Remaining lifetime risks for atherosclerotic

CVD events were only 5.2% in men and 8.2% in women with optimal risk factors 
at 50 years of age compared with 68.9% in men and 50.2% in women with ≥2 
major risk factors at age 50. In addition, men and women with optimal risk factors 
had a median life expectancy ≥10 years longer than those with ≥2 major risk factors 
at age 50 years.5
•
A recent study examined the association between low lifetime predicted risk for 
CVD (ie, having all optimal or near-optimal risk factor levels) and burden of 
subclinical atherosclerosis in younger adults in the Coronary Artery Risk 
Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) and MESA studies of the NHLBI. 
Among participants <50 years of age, nearly half had low and half had high 
predicted lifetime risks for CVD. Those with low predicted lifetime risk had lower 
prevalence and less severe amounts of coronary calcification and less carotid 
intima-media thickening, even at these younger ages, than those with high 
predicted lifetime risk. During follow-up, those with low predicted lifetime risk 
also had less progression of coronary calcium.56
•
In another study, FHS investigators followed up 2531 men and women who were 
examined between the ages of 40 and 50 years and observed their overall rates of 
survival and survival free of CVD to 85 years of age and beyond. Low levels of the 
major risk factors in middle age was associated with overall survival and 
morbidity-free survival to 85 years of age or more.57
—
Overall, 35.7% survived to the age of 85 years, and 22% survived to that 
age free of major morbidities.
—
Factors associated with survival to the age of 85 years included female 
sex, lower systolic BP, lower total cholesterol, better glucose tolerance, 
absence of current smoking, and higher level of education attained. 
Factors associated with survival to the age of 85 years free of MI, 
unstable angina, HF, stroke, dementia, and cancer were nearly identical.
—
When adverse levels of 4 of these factors were present in middle age, 
<5% of men and ≈15% of women survived to 85 years of age.
•
A study of 366 000 men and women from the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention 
Trial (MRFIT) and Chicago Heart Association Detection Project in Industry 
defined low-risk status as follows: serum cholesterol level <200 mg/dL, untreated 
BP 120/80 mm Hg, absence of current smoking, absence of DM, and absence of 
major electrocardiographic abnormalities. Compared with those who did not have 
low risk factor burden, those with low risk factor burden had between 73% and 
85% lower relative risk (RR) for CVD mortality, 40% to 60% lower relative total 
mortality rates, and 6 to 10 years’ longer life expectancy.39
•
A study of 84 129 women enrolled in the Nurses’ Health Study identified 5 healthy 
lifestyle factors, including absence of current smoking, drinking half a glass or 
more of wine per day (or equivalent alcohol consumption), half an hour or more per 
day of moderate or vigorous PA, BMI <25 kg/m2, and dietary score in the top 40% 
(which included diets with lower amounts of trans fats, lower glycemic load, higher

cereal fiber, higher marine omega-3 fatty acids, higher folate, and higher 
polyunsaturated to saturated fat ratio). When 3 of the 5 healthy lifestyle factors 
were present, the RR for CHD over a 14-year period was 57% lower; when 4 were 
present, RR was 66% lower; and when all 5 factors were present, RR was 83% 
lower.58 However, data from NHANES 1999–2002 showed that only about one 
third of adults complied with 6 or more of the recommended heart-healthy 
behaviors. Dietary recommendations, in general, and daily fruit intake 
recommendations, in particular, were least likely to be followed.59
•
In the Chicago Heart Association Detection Project in Industry, remaining lifetime 
risks for CVD death were noted to increase substantially and in a graded fashion 
according to the number of risk factors present in middle age (40 to 59 years of 
age). However, remaining lifetime risks for non-CVD death also increased 
dramatically with increasing CVD risk factor burden. These data help to explain the 
markedly greater longevity experienced by those who reach middle age free of 
major CVD risk factors.60
•
Among individuals 70 to 90 years of age, adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet 
and greater PA are associated with 65% to 73% relatively lower rates of all-cause 
mortality, as well as lower mortality rates due to CHD, CVD, and cancer.61
•
Seventeen-year mortality data from the NHANES II Mortality Follow-Up Study 
indicated that the RR for fatal CHD was 51% lower for men and 71% lower for 
women with none of 3 major risk factors (hypertension, current smoking, and 
elevated total cholesterol [≥ 240 mg/dL]) than for those with 1 or more risk factors. 
Had all 3 major risk factors not occurred, it is hypothesized that 64% of all CHD 
deaths among women and 45% of CHD deaths in men could have been avoided.62
•
Investigators from the Chicago Heart Association Detection Project in Industry 
have also observed that risk factor burden in middle age is associated with better 
quality of life at follow-up in older age (≈25 years later) and lower average annual 
Medicare costs at older ages.
—
The presence of a greater number of risk factors in middle age is 
associated with lower scores at older ages on assessment of social 
functioning, mental health, walking, and health perception in women, 
with similar findings in men.63
—
Similarly, the existence of a greater number of risk factors in middle age 
is associated with higher average annual CVD-related and total Medicare 
costs (once Medicare eligibility is attained).64
Hospital Discharges, Ambulatory Care Visits, and Nursing Home Residents
•
From 1997 to 2007, the number of inpatient discharges from short-stay hospitals 
with CVD as the first-listed diagnosis decreased from 6 097 000 to 5 890 000 
(NHDS, NCHS, and NHLBI). In 2007, CVD ranked highest among all disease 
categories in hospital discharges. (NHDS, NCHS, and NHLBI).

•
In 2008, there were 91 736 000 physician office visits with a primary diagnosis of 
CVD (NCHS, NAMCS).65 In 2008, there were 4 866 000 ED visits with a primary 
diagnosis of CVD (NCHS, National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey 
[NHAMCS]).66
•
In 2008, there were 8 795 000 hospital OPD visits with a primary diagnosis of 
CVD (NHAMCS).66 In 2005, ≈1 of every 6 hospital stays, or almost 6 million, 
resulted from CVD (AHRQ, NIS). The total inpatient hospital cost for CVD was 
$71.2 billion, approximately one fourth of the total cost of inpatient hospital care in 
the United States. The average cost per hospitalization was ≈41% higher than the 
average cost for all stays. Hospital admissions that originated in the ED accounted 
for 60.7% of all hospital stays for CVD. This was 41% higher than the overall rate 
of 43.1%; 3.3% of patients admitted to the hospital for CVD died in the hospital, 
which was significantly higher than the average in-hospital death rate of 2.1%.67
•
In 2004, coronary atherosclerosis was estimated to be responsible for 1.2 million 
hospital stays and was the most expensive condition treated. This condition resulted 
in >$44 billion in expenses. More than half of the hospital stays for coronary 
atherosclerosis were among patients who also received percutaneous coronary 
intervention or cardiac revascularization (coronary artery bypass graft; CABG) 
during their stay. Acute MI resulted in $31 billion of inpatient hospital charges for 
695 000 hospital stays. The 1.1 million hospitalizations for CHF amounted to 
nearly $29 billion in hospital charges.69
•
In 2003, ≈48.3% of inpatient hospital stays for CVD were for women, who 
accounted for 42.8% of the national cost ($187 billion) associated with these 
conditions. Although only 40% of hospital stays for acute MI and coronary 
atherosclerosis were for women, more than half of all stays for nonspecific chest 
pain, CHF, and stroke were for women. There was no difference between men and 
women in hospitalizations for cardiac dysrhythmias.69
•
Circulatory disorders were the most frequent reason for admission to the hospital 
through the ED, accounting for 26.3% of all admissions through the ED. After 
pneumonia, the most common heart-related conditions (in descending order) were 
CHF, chest pain, hardening of the arteries, and heart attack, which together 
accounted for >15% of all admissions through the ED. Stroke and irregular heart 
beat ranked seventh and eighth, respectively.70
•
In 2004, nursing home residents had a primary diagnosis of CVD at admission 
(23.7%) and at the time of interview (25%). This was the leading primary diagnosis 
for these residents (NCHS, NNHS).67
•
Among current home health care patients in 2007, 18.3% had a primary diagnosis 
of CVD at admission and 62.9% had any diagnosis of CVD at the time of interview 
(NCHS, National Home and Hospice Care Survey [NHHCS] unpublished data).
•
Among patients discharged from hospice in 2007, 15.8% had a primary diagnosis 
of CVD at admission (NCHS, NHHCS unpublished data).

Operations and Procedures
•
In 2007, an estimated 6 846 000 inpatient cardiovascular operations and procedures 
were performed in the United States; 3.9 million were performed on males, and 2.9 
million were performed on females (NHDS, NCHS, and NHLBI).
Cost
•
The estimated direct and indirect cost of CVD for 2007 is $286.6 billion (MEPS, 
AHRQ, and NHLBI).
•
In 2006, $32.7 billion in program payments were made to Medicare beneficiaries 
discharged from short-stay hospitals with a principal diagnosis of CVD. That was 
an average of $10 201 per discharge.71

4. Subclinical Atherosclerosis
See Table 4-1 and Charts 4-1 through 4-6.
Atherosclerosis, a systemic disease process in which fatty deposits, inflammation, cells, and 
scar tissue build up within the walls of arteries, is the underlying cause of the majority of 
clinical cardiovascular events. Individuals who develop atherosclerosis tend to develop it in 
a number of different types of arteries (large and small arteries and those feeding the heart, 
brain, kidneys, and extremities), although they may have much more in some artery types 
than others. In recent decades, advances in imaging technology have allowed for improved 
ability to detect and quantify atherosclerosis at all stages and in multiple different vascular 
beds. Two modalities, computed tomography (CT) of the chest for evaluation of coronary 
artery calcification (CAC) and B-mode ultrasound of the neck for evaluation of carotid 
artery intima-media thickness (IMT), have been used in large studies with outcomes data 
and may help define the burden of atherosclerosis in individuals before they develop clinical 
events such as heart attack or stroke. Another commonly used method for detecting and 
quantifying atherosclerosis in the peripheral arteries is the ankle-brachial index, which is 
discussed in Chapter 10. Data on cardiovascular outcomes are starting to emerge for 
additional modalities for measuring subclinical disease, including brachial artery reactivity 
testing, aortic and carotid magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and tonometric methods of 
measuring vascular compliance or microvascular reactivity. Further research may help to 
define the role of these techniques in cardiovascular risk assessment. Some guidelines have 
recommended screening for subclinical atherosclerosis, especially by CAC, or IMT may be 
appropriate in people at intermediate risk for heart disease (eg, 10-year estimated risk of 
10% to 20%) but not for lower-risk general population screening or for people with 
preexisting HD, DM, or other high-risk conditions.1,2

may be present even in the absence of CAC.
•
The presence of any CAC, which indicates that at least some atherosclerotic plaque 
is present, is defined by an Agatston score >0. Clinically significant plaque, 
frequently an indication for more aggressive risk factor management, is often 
defined by a score ≥100 or a score ≥75th percentile for one’s age and sex. A score 
≥400 has been noted to be an indication for further diagnostic evaluation (eg, 
exercise testing or myocardial perfusion imaging) for coronary artery disease 
(CAD).
Prevalence
•
The NHLBI’s FHS measured CAC in 3238 white adults from <45 years of age to 
≥75 years of age.3
•
Overall, 32.0% of women and 52.9% of men had prevalent CAC, defined as age-
specific cut points >90th percentile in a healthy referent sample.
•
Among FHS participants at intermediate risk, 58% of women and 64% of men had 
prevalent CAC.
•
The NHLBI’s Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) 
study measured CAC in 3043 black and white adults 33 to 45 years of age (at the 
CARDIA year 15 examination).4
—
Overall, 15.0% of men and 5.1% of women, 5.5% of those 33 to 39 years 
of age and 13.3% of those 40 to 45 years of age, had prevalent CAC. 
Overall, 1.6% of subjects had a score that exceeded 100.
—
Chart 4-1 shows the prevalence of CAC by ethnicity and sex. The 
prevalence of CAC was lower in black men than in white men but was 
similar in black and white women at these ages.
•
The NHLBI’s MESA study measured CAC in 6814 subjects 45 to 84 years of age, 
including white (n = 2619), black (n = 1898), Hispanic (n = 1494), and Chinese (n 
= 803) men and women.5
—
Chart 4-2 shows the prevalence of CAC by sex and ethnicity.
—
The prevalence and 75th percentile levels of CAC were highest in white 
men and lowest in black and Hispanic women. Significant ethnic 
differences persisted after adjustment for risk factors, with the RR of 
coronary calcium being 22% less in blacks, 15% less in Hispanics, and 
8% less in Chinese than in whites.
—
Table 4-1 shows the 75th percentile levels of CAC by sex and race at 
selected ages. These might be considered cut points above which more 
aggressive efforts to control risk factors (eg, elevated cholesterol or BP) 
could be implemented and/or at which treatment goals might be more 
aggressive (eg, LDL cholesterol <100 mg/dL instead of <130 mg/dL).

CAC and Incidence of Coronary Events
•
The NHLBI’s MESA study recently reported on the association of CAC scores 
with first CHD events over a median follow-up of 3.9 years among a population-
based sample of 6722 men and women (39% white, 27% black, 22% Hispanic, and 
12% Chinese).6
—
Chart 4-3 shows the relative risks (RRs) or hazard ratios (HRs) associated 
with CAC scores of 1 to 100, 101 to 300, and >300 compared with those 
without CAC (score=0), after adjustment for standard risk factors. People 
with CAC scores of 1 to 100 had ≈4 times greater risk and those with 
CAC scores >100 were 7 to 10 times more likely to experience a coronary 
event than those without CAC.
—
CAC provided similar predictive value for coronary events in whites, 
Chinese, blacks, and Hispanics (HRs ranging from 1.15 to 1.39 for each 
doubling of coronary calcium).
•
In another report of a community-based sample, not referred for clinical reasons, 
the South Bay Heart Watch examined CAC in 1461 adults (average age 66 years) 
with coronary risk factors, with a median of 7.0 years of follow-up.7
•
Chart 4-4 shows the HRs associated with increasing CAC scores (relative to 
CAC=0 and <10% risk category) in low-risk (<10%), intermediate-risk (10% to 
15% and 16% to 20%), and high-risk (>20%) Framingham Risk Score (FRS) 
categories of estimated risk for CHD in 10 years. Increasing CAC scores further 
predicted risk in intermediate- and high-risk groups.
•
In a study of healthy adults 60 to 72 years of age who were free of clinical CAD, 
predictors of the progression of CAC were assessed. Predictors tested included age, 
sex, race/ethnicity, smoking status, BMI, family history of CAD, C-reactive 
protein, several measures of DM, insulin levels, BP, and lipids. Insulin resistance, 
in addition to the traditional cardiac risk factors, independently predicts progression 
of CAC.8 Clinically, however, it is not yet recommended to conduct serial scanning 
of CAC to measure effects of therapeutic interventions.
•
It is noteworthy that, as recently demonstrated in the MESA study in 5878 subjects 
with a median of 5.8 years of follow-up, the addition of CAC to standard risk 
factors resulted in significant improvement of classification of risk for incident 
CHD events, placing 77% of people in the highest or lowest risk categories 
compared with 69% based on risk factors alone. Moreover, an additional 23% of 
those who experienced events were reclassified as high risk and 13% with events 
were reclassified as low risk.9
Carotid IMT
Background
•
Carotid IMT measures the thickness of 2 layers (the intima and media) of the wall 
of the carotid arteries, the largest conduits of blood going to the brain. Carotid IMT 
is thought to be an even earlier manifestation of atherosclerosis than CAC, because

thickening precedes the development of frank atherosclerotic plaque. Carotid IMT 
methods are still being refined, so it is important to know which part of the artery 
was measured (common carotid, internal carotid, or bulb) and whether near and far 
walls were both measured. This information can affect the average-thickness 
measurement that is usually reported.
•
Unlike CAC, everyone has some thickness to their arteries, but people who develop 
atherosclerosis have greater thickness. Ultrasound of the carotid arteries can also 
detect plaques and determine the degree of narrowing of the artery that they may 
cause. Epidemiological data, including the data discussed below, have indicated 
that high-risk levels might be considered as those in the highest quartile or quintile 
for one’s age and sex, or ≥1 mm.
•
Although ultrasound is commonly used to diagnose plaque in the carotid arteries in 
people who have had strokes or who have bruits (sounds of turbulence in the 
artery), guidelines are limited as to screening of asymptomatic people for carotid 
IMT to quantify atherosclerosis or predict risk. However, some organizations have 
recognized that carotid IMT measurement by B-mode ultrasonography may provide 
an independent assessment of coronary risk.10
Prevalence and Association With Incident Cardiovascular Events
•
The Bogalusa Heart Study measured carotid IMT in 518 black and white men and 
women at a mean age of 32±3 years. These men and women were healthy but 
overweight.11
—
The mean values of carotid IMT for the different segments are shown in 
Chart 4-5 by sex and race. Men had significantly higher carotid IMT in 
all segments than women, and blacks had higher common carotid and 
carotid bulb IMTs than whites.
—
Even at this young age, after adjustment for age, race, and sex, carotid 
IMT was associated significantly and positively with waist 
circumference, SBP, DBP, and LDL cholesterol. Carotid IMT was 
inversely correlated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol 
levels. Participants with greater numbers of adverse risk factors (0, 1, 2, 
3, or more) had stepwise increases in mean carotid IMT levels.
•
In a subsequent analysis, the Bogalusa investigators examined the association of 
risk factors measured since childhood with carotid IMT measured in these young 
adults.12 Higher BMI and LDL cholesterol levels measured at 4 to 7 years of age 
were associated with increased risk for being >75th percentile for carotid IMT in 
young adulthood. Higher SBP and LDL cholesterol and lower HDL cholesterol in 
young adulthood were also associated with having high carotid IMT. These data 
highlight the importance of adverse risk factor levels in early childhood and young 
adulthood in the early development of atherosclerosis.
•
Among both women and men in MESA, blacks had the highest common carotid 
IMT, but they were similar to whites and Hispanics in internal carotid IMT.

Chinese participants had the lowest carotid IMT, in particular, in the internal 
carotid, of the 4 ethnic groups (Chart 4-6).
•
The NHLBI’s CHS reported follow-up of 4476 men and women ≥65 years of age 
(mean age 72 years) who were free of CVD at baseline.13
—
Mean maximal common carotid IMT was 1.03± 0.20 mm, and mean 
internal carotid IMT was 1.37±0.55 mm.
—
After a mean follow-up of 6.2 years, those with maximal carotid IMT in 
the highest quintile had a 4- to 5-fold greater risk for incident heart attack 
or stroke than those in the bottom quintile. After adjustment for other risk 
factors, there was still a 2- to 3-fold greater risk for the top versus the 
bottom quintile.
•
More recently, the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study has demonstrated in 
13 145 subjects the addition of carotid IMT combined with identification of plaque 
presence or absence to traditional risk factors to reclassify risk in 23% of 
individuals overall, with a net reclassification improvement of 9.9% (with most 
classified to a lower risk group). There was a modest, but statistically significant 
improvement in the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve from 
0.742 to 0.755.14
CAC and Carotid IMT
•
In the NHLBI’s MESA study of white, black, Chinese, and Hispanic adults 45 to 
84 years of age, carotid IMT and CAC were found to be commonly associated, but 
patterns of association differed somewhat by sex and race.15
— Common and internal carotid IMT were greater in women and men who had 
CAC than in those who did not, regardless of ethnicity.
—
Overall, CAC prevalence and scores were associated with 
carotid IMT, but associations were somewhat weaker in 
blacks than in other ethnic groups.
—
In general, blacks had the thickest carotid IMT of all 4 ethnic 
groups, regardless of the presence of CAC.
—
Common carotid IMT differed little by race/ethnicity in 
women with any CAC, but among women with no CAC, 
IMT was higher among blacks (0.86 mm) than in the other 3 
groups (0.76 to 0.80 mm).
•
In a more recent analysis from the NHLBI’s MESA study, the investigators 
reported on follow-up of 6698 men and women in 4 ethnic groups over 5.3 years 
and compared the predictive utility of carotid IMT and CAC.16
—
CAC was associated more strongly than carotid IMT with the risk of 
incident CVD.

—
After adjustment for each other (CAC score and IMT) and for traditional 
CVD risk factors, the HR for CVD increased 2.1-fold for each 1-standard 
deviation (SD) increment of log-transformed CAC score versus 1.3-fold 
for each 1-SD increment of the maximum carotid IMT.
—
For CHD events, the HRs per 1-SD increment increased 2.5-fold for CAC 
score and 1.2-fold for IMT.
—
A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis also suggested that 
CAC score was a better predictor of incident CVD than was IMT, with 
areas under the curve of 0.81 versus 0.78, respectively.
—
Investigators from the NHLBI’s CARDIA and MESA studies examined 
the burden and progression of subclinical atherosclerosis among adults 
<50 years of age. Ten-year and lifetime risks for CVD were estimated for 
each participant, and the young adults were stratified into 3 groups: (1) 
those with low 10-year (<10%) and low lifetime (<39%) predicted risk 
for CVD; (2) those with low 10-year (<10%) but high lifetime (≥39%) 
predicted risk; and (3) those with high 10-year risk (>10%). The latter 
group had the highest burden and greatest progression of subclinical 
atherosclerosis. Given the young age of those studied, ≈90% of 
participants were at low 10-year risk, but of these, half had high predicted 
lifetime risk. Compared with those with low short-term/low lifetime 
predicted risks, those with low short-term/high lifetime predicted risk had 
significantly greater burden and progression of CAC and significantly 
greater burden of carotid IMT, even at these younger ages. These data 
confirm the importance of early exposure to risk factors for the onset and 
progression of subclinical atherosclerosis.17
Measures of Vascular Function and Incident CVD Events
Background
•
Measures of arterial tonometry (stiffness) are based on the concept that pulse 
pressure has shown to be an important risk factor for CVD. Arterial tonometry 
offers the ability to directly and noninvasively measure central pulse wave velocity 
in the thoracic and abdominal aorta.
•
Brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD) is a marker for nitric oxide release from the 
endothelium that can be measured using ultrasound. Impaired FMD is an early 
marker of CVD.
•
Recommendations have not been specific, however, as to which, if any, measures 
of vascular function may be useful for CVD risk stratification in selected patient 
subgroups.
Arterial Tonometry and CVD
•
The Rotterdam Study measured arterial stiffness in 2835 elderly participants (mean 
age 71 years18). They found that as aortic pulse wave velocity increased, the risk of

coronary heart disease was 1.72 (second versus first tertile) and 2.45 (third versus 
first tertile). Results remained robust even after accounting for carotid IMT, ankle-
brachial index, and pulse pressure.
•
A study from Denmark measured 1678 individuals aged 40 to 70 years, and found 
that aortic pulse wave velocity increased CVD risk by 16% to 20%.19
•
The FHS measured several indices of arterial stiffness, including pulse wave 
velocity wave reflection and central pulse pressure.20 They found that not only was 
higher pulse wave velocity associated with a 48% increased risk of incident CVD 
events, but pulse wave velocity additionally improved CVD risk prediction 
(integrated discrimination index of 0.7%, P<0.05).
Flow-Mediated Dilation and CVD
•
The MESA study measured FMD in 3026 participants (mean age 61 years) that 
were free of CVD. As FMD increased (ie, improved brachial function), the risk of 
CVD was 16% lower.21 FMD also improved CVD risk prediction, compared with 
the FRS, by improving net reclassification by 29%.

Prevalence
•
On the basis of data from NHANES 2005 to 2008 (NCHS; unpublished NHLBI 
tabulation (Table 5-1; Chart 5-1), an estimated 16 300 000 Americans ≥20 years of 
age have CHD:
—
Total CHD prevalence is 7.0% in US adults ≥20 years of age. CHD 
prevalence is 8.3% for men and 6.1% for women.
—
Among non-Hispanic whites, CHD prevalence is 8.5% for men and 5.8% 
for women.
—
Among non-Hispanic blacks, CHD prevalence is 7.9% for men and 7.6% 
for women.
—
Among Mexican Americans, CHD prevalence is 6.3% for men and 5.6% 
for women.
—
Among Hispanic or Latino individuals ≥18 years of age, CHD prevalence 
is 5.8% (2009 NHIS, NCHS).1
—
Among American Indians/Alaska Natives ≥18 years of age, it is estimated 
that 4.1% have CHD (estimate considered unreliable), and among Asians 
≥18 years of age, it is 3.9% (2009 NHIS, NCHS).1
•
According to data from NHANES 2005 to 2008 (NCHS; unpublished NHLBI 
tabulation), the overall prevalence for MI is 3.1% in US adults ≥20 years of age. MI 
prevalence is 4.3% for men and 2.2% for women.
—
Among non-Hispanic whites, MI prevalence is 4.3% for men and 2.1% 
for women.
—
Among non-Hispanic blacks, MI prevalence is 4.3% for men and 2.2% 
for women.
—
Among Mexican Americans, MI prevalence is 3.0% for men and 1.1% 
for women.

•
Data from 2009 from the BRFSS survey of the CDC found that 4.0% of 
respondents had been told that they had had an MI. The highest prevalence was in 
West Virginia (6.5%) and Kentucky (5.9%). The lowest prevalence was in the 
District of Columbia (1.9%). In the same survey, 3.8% of respondents were told 
that they had angina or CHD. The highest prevalence was in West Virginia (7.1%), 
and the lowest was in the District of Columbia (2.0%).2
Incidence
•
On the basis of unpublished data from the ARIC and CHS studies of the NHLBI:
—
This year, ≈785 000 Americans will have a new coronary attack, and 
≈470 000 will have a recurrent attack. It is estimated that an additional 
195 000 silent MIs occur each year. That assumes that ≈21% of the 935 
000 first and recurrent MIs are silent.3,4
—
The estimated annual incidence of MI is 610 000 new attacks and 325 
000 recurrent attacks.
—
Average age at first MI is 64.5 years for men and 70.3 years for women.
•
On the basis of the NHLBI-sponsored FHS:
—
CHD makes up more than half of all cardiovascular events in men and 
women <75 years of age.3
—
The lifetime risk of developing CHD after 40 years of age is 49% for men 
and 32% for women.5
—
The incidence of CHD in women lags behind men by 10 years for total 
CHD and by 20 years for more serious clinical events such as MI and 
sudden death.3
•
In the NHLBI-sponsored ARIC study, in participants 45 to 64 years of age, the 
average age-adjusted CHD incidence rates per 1000 person-years were as follows: 
white men, 12.5; black men, 10.6; white women, 4.0; and black women, 5.1. 
Incidence rates excluding revascularization procedures were as follows: white men, 
7.9; black men, 9.2; white women, 2.9; and black women, 4.9.6
•
Incidence rates for MI in the NHLBI-sponsored ARIC study are displayed in 
Charts 5–3 and 5–4, stratified by age, race, and sex. The annual age-adjusted rates 
per 1000 population of first MI (1987–2001) in ARIC Surveillance (NHLBI) were 
4.2 in black men, 3.9 in white men, 2.8 in black women, and 1.7 in white women.7
•
Analysis of more than 40 years of physician-validated acute myocardial infarction 
(AMI) data in the FHS study of the NHLBI found that AMI rates diagnosed by 
ECG criteria declined ≈50% with a concomitant 2-fold increase in rates of AMI 
diagnosed by blood markers. These findings may explain the paradoxical stability 
of AMI rates in the United States despite concomitant improvements in CHD risk 
factors.8

•
Among American Indians 65 to 74 years of age, the annual rates per 1000 
population of new and recurrent MIs were 7.6 for men and 4.9 for women.9 
Analysis of data from NHANES III (1988 –1994) and NHANES 1999 to 2002 
(NCHS) showed that in adults 20 to 74 years of age, the overall distribution of 10-
year risk of developing CHD changed little during this time. Among the 3 racial/
ethnic groups, blacks had the highest proportion of participants in the high-risk 
group.10
•
Based on data from the NHDS, since the mid-1990s, the rate of hospitalization for 
MI and in-hospital case fatality rates have decreased.11
•
From 2002 to 2007, the rates of hospitalization for MI decreased among Medicare 
beneficiaries. However, the degree of reduction was more significant in whites than 
African Americans.12
Mortality
•
CHD caused ≈1 of every 6 deaths in the United States in 2007. CHD mortality was 
406 351.13
•
CHD any-mention mortality was 571 402. MI mortality was 132 968. MI any-
mention mortality was 172 538 (NHLBI tabulation; NCHS public-use data files). 
The 2007 CHD death rate was 126.0.13 CHD is the largest major killer of American 
males and females.13
•
Approximately every 25 seconds, an American will experience a coronary event, 
and approximately every minute, someone will die of one.
•
Approximately 34% of the people who experience a coronary attack in a given year 
will die of it, and ≈15% who experience a heart attack (MI) will die of it (AHA 
computation).
•
Approximately every 34 seconds, an American will have an MI.
•
The percentage of CHD deaths that occurred out of the hospital in 2007 was 70%. 
According to NCHS mortality data, 286 000 CHD deaths occur out of the hospital 
or in hospital EDs annually (2007, ICD-10 codes I20 to I25) (NHLBI tabulation of 
NCHS mortality data).
•
A study of 1275 health maintenance organization enrollees 50 to 79 years of age 
who had cardiac arrest showed that the incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest 
was 6.0/1000 subject-years in subjects with any clinically recognized HD compared 
with 0.8/1000 subject-years in subjects without HD. In subgroups with HD, 
incidence was 13.6/1000 subject-years in subjects with prior MI and 21.9/1000 
subject-years in subjects with HF.15
Temporal Trends in CHD Mortality
•
An analysis of FHS data (NHLBI) from 1950 to 1999 showed that overall CHD 
death rates decreased by 59%. Nonsudden CHD death decreased by 64%, and 
sudden cardiac death fell by 49%. These trends were seen in men and women, in

subjects with and without a prior history of CHD, and in smokers and 
nonsmokers.16
•
The decline in CHD mortality rates partly reflects the shift in the pattern of clinical 
presentations of AMI. In the last decade, there has been a marked decline in ST-
segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) (from 133 to 50 cases per 100 
000 person-years).17
•
From 1997 to 2007, the annual death rate due to CHD declined 26.3%, and the 
actual number of deaths declined 12.9%. (Appropriate comparability ratios were 
applied.) In 2007, the overall CHD death rate was 126.0 per 100 000 population. 
The death rates were 165.6 for white males and 191.6 for black males; for white 
females, the rate was 94.2, and for black females, it was 121.5.13 Age-adjusted 
death rates for CHD were 122.3 for Hispanic or Latino males and 77.8 for females, 
112.2 for American Indian or Alaska Native males and 65.6 for females, and 91.7 
for Asian or Pacific Islander males and 55.0 for females.13
•
Approximately 81% of people who die of CHD are ≥65 years of age (NCHS; AHA 
computation).
•
The estimated average number of years of life lost because of an MI is 16.6 
(NHLBI tabulation of NCHS mortality data).
•
On the basis of data from the FHS of the NHLBI3:
—
Fifty percent of men and 64% of women who die suddenly of CHD have 
no previous symptoms of this disease. Between 70% and 89% of sudden 
cardiac deaths occur in men, and the annual incidence is 3 to 4 times 
higher in men than in women; however, this disparity decreases with 
advancing age.
—
People who have had an MI have a sudden death rate 4 to 6 times that of 
the general population.
•
According to data from the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction18:
—
From 1990 to 1999, in-hospital AMI mortality declined from 11.2% to 
9.4%.
—
Mortality rate increases for every 30 minutes that elapse before a patient 
with ST-segment elevation is recognized and treated.
•
CHD death rates have fallen from 1968 to the present. Analysis of NHANES 
(NCHS) data compared CHD death rates between 1980 and 2000 to determine how 
much of the decline in deaths due to CHD over that period could be explained by 
the use of medical and surgical treatments versus changes in CVD risk factors 
(resulting from lifestyle/behavior). After 1980 and 2000 data were compared, it was 
estimated that ≈47% of the decrease in CHD deaths was attributable to treatments, 
including the following19:
—
Secondary preventive therapies after MI or revascularization (11%).

—
Initial treatments for AMI or unstable angina (UA; 10%).
—
Treatments for HF (9%).
—
Revascularization for chronic angina (5%). — Other therapies (12%), 
including antihypertensive and lipid-lowering primary prevention 
therapies.
•
It was also estimated that a similar amount of the reduction in CHD deaths, ≈44%, 
was attributable to changes in risk factors, including the following19:
—
Lower total cholesterol (24%).
—
Lower SBP (20%).
—
Lower smoking prevalence (12%).
—
Decreased physical inactivity (5%).
—
Nevertheless, these favorable improvements in risk factors were offset in 
part by increases in BMI and in diabetes mellitus prevalence, which 
accounted for an increased number of deaths (8% and 10%, respectively).
•
Between 1980 and 2002, death rates due to CHD among men and women ≥65 years 
of age fell by 52% in men and 49% in women. Among men, the death rate declined 
on average by 2.9% per year in the 1980s, 2.6% per year during the 1990s, and 
4.4% per year from 2000 to 2002. Among women, death rates fell by 2.6%, 2.4%, 
and 4.4%, respectively. However, when stratified by age, among men 35 to 54 
years of age, the average annual rate of death fell by 6.2%, 2.3%, and 0.5%, 
respectively. Among women 35 to 54 years of age, the average annual rate of death 
fell by 5.4% and 1.2% and then increased by 1.5%, respectively. This increase was 
not statistically significant; however, in even younger women (35 to 44 years of 
age), the rate of death has been increasing by an average of 1.3% annually between 
1997 and 2002, which is statistically significant.20
•
An analysis of 28 studies published from 1977 to 2007 found that revascularization 
by coronary bypass surgery or percutaneous intervention in conjunction with 
medical therapy in patients with nonacute CAD is associated with significantly 
improved survival compared with medical therapy alone.21
•
A recent analysis of Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services data suggest that 
between 1995 and 2006, the 30-day mortality rate from MI decreased, as has 
hospital variation in mortality from MI.22
•
Data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database suggest that mortality from 
MI have decreased since 1988.23
Risk Factors
•
Risk factors for CHD act synergistically to increase CHD risk, as shown in the 
example in Chart 5-6.

•
A study of men and women in 3 prospective cohort studies found that antecedent 
major CHD risk factor exposures were common among those who developed CHD. 
Approximately 90% of patients with CHD have prior exposure to at least 1 of these 
major risk factors, which include high total blood cholesterol levels or current 
medication with cholesterol-lowering drugs, hypertension or current medication 
with BP-lowering drugs, current cigarette use, and clinical report of diabetes 
mellitus.24
•
According to a case-control study of 52 countries (INTER-HEART), optimization 
of 9 easily measured and potentially modifiable risk factors could result in a 90% 
reduction in the risk of an initial AMI. The effect of these risk factors is consistent 
in men and women across different geographic regions and by ethnic group, which 
makes the study applicable worldwide. These 9 risk factors include cigarette 
smoking, abnormal blood lipid levels, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, abdominal 
obesity, a lack of PA, low daily fruit and vegetable consumption, alcohol 
overconsumption, and psychosocial index.25
•
A study of >3000 members of the FHS (NHLBI) Offspring Cohort without CHD 
showed that among men with 10-year predicted risk for CHD of 20%, both failure 
to reach target heart rate and ST-segment depression more than doubled the risk of 
an event, and each metabolic equivalent increment in exercise capacity reduced risk 
by 13%.26
•
A study of non-Hispanic white people 35 to 74 years of age in the FHS (NHLBI) 
and the NHANES III (NCHS) studies showed that 26% of men and 41% of women 
had at least 1 borderline risk factor in NHANES III. It is estimated that >90% of 
CHD events will occur in individuals with at least 1 elevated risk factor and that 
≈8% will occur in people with only borderline levels of multiple risk factors. 
Absolute 10-year CHD risk exceeded 10% both in men >45 years of age who had 1 
elevated risk factor and ≥4 borderline risk factors and in those who had ≥2 elevated 
risk factors. In women, absolute CHD risk was >10% only in those >55 years of 
age who had ≥3 elevated risk factors.27
•
A recent analysis examined the number and combination of risk factors necessary 
to exceed Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) treatment thresholds. In this 
analysis, relatively high risk factor levels were required to exceed ATP III 
treatment thresholds in men <45 years of age and women <65 years of age, which 
suggests that alternative means of risk prediction that focus on a longer time 
horizon than the 10 years captured by the traditional Framingham CHD risk score 
may be necessary to estimate risk in these individuals.28
•
Analysis of data from the CHS study (NHLBI) among participants ≥65 years of age 
at entry into the study showed that subclinical CVD is prevalent among older 
individuals, is independently associated with risk of CHD (even over a 10-year 
follow-up period), and substantially increases the risk of CHD among participants 
with hypertension or DM.29

•
On the basis of data from the CDC/BRFSS, it was found that patients with CHD 
are less likely to comply with PA recommendations than are subjects without CHD. 
Only 32% of CHD patients met moderate PA recommendations, 22% met vigorous 
PA recommendations, and 40% met total PA recommendations. In contrast, the 
percentage of subjects without CHD who met PA recommendations was 
significantly higher, and this percentage almost achieved the Healthy People 2010 
objectives for PA.30
•
Analysis of data from the PREMIER trial (Prospective Registry Evaluating 
Myocardial Infarction: Events and Recovery), sponsored by the NHLBI, found that 
in people with prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension, 2 multicomponent 
behavioral interventions significantly reduced estimated 10-year CHD risk by 12% 
and 14%, respectively, compared with advice only.31
Awareness of Warning Signs and Risk Factors for HD
•
Data from the Women Veterans Cohort showed that 42% of women ≥35 years of 
age were concerned about HD. Only 8% to 20% were aware that CAD is the major 
cause of death for women.32
•
Among people in 14 states and Washington, DC, participating in the 2005 BRFSS, 
only 27% were aware of 5 heart attack warning signs and symptoms (1, pain in jaw, 
neck, or back; 2, weak, lightheaded, or faint; 3, chest pain or discomfort; 4, pain or 
discomfort in arms or shoulder; and 5, shortness of breath) and indicated that they 
would first call 911 if they thought someone was having a heart attack or stroke. 
Awareness of all 5 heart attack warning signs and symptoms and the need to call 
911 was higher among non-Hispanic whites (30.2%), women (30.8%), and those 
with a college education or more (33.4%) than among non-Hispanic blacks and 
Hispanics (16.2% and 14.3%, respectively), men (22.5%), and those with less than 
a high school education (15.7%), respectively. By state, awareness was highest in 
West Virginia (35.5%) and lowest in Washington, DC (16.0%).33
•
A 2004 national study of physician awareness and adherence to CVD prevention 
guidelines showed that fewer than 1 in 5 physicians knew that more women than 
men die each year of CVD.34
•
A recent community surveillance study in 4 US communities reported that in 2000, 
the overall proportion of people with delays of ≥4 hours from onset of AMI 
symptoms to hospital arrival was 49.5%. The study also reported that from 1987 to 
2000, there was no statistically significant change in the proportion of patients 
whose delays were ≥4 hours, which indicates that there has been little improvement 
in the speed at which patients with MI symptoms arrive at the hospital after 
symptom onset. Although the proportion of patients with MI who arrived at the 
hospital by EMS increased over this period, from 37% in 1987% to 55% in 2000, 
the total time between onset and hospital arrival did not change appreciably.35
•
According to 2003 data from the BRFSS (CDC), 36.5% of all women surveyed had 
multiple risk factors for HD and stroke. The age-standardized prevalence of 
multiple risk factors was lowest in whites and Asians. After adjustment for age,

income, education, and health coverage, the odds for multiple risk factors were 
greater in black and Native American women and lower for Hispanic women than 
for white women. Prevalence estimates and odds of multiple risk factors increased 
with age; decreased with education, income, and employment; and were lower in 
those with no health coverage. Smoking was more common in younger women, 
whereas older women were more likely to have medical conditions and to be 
physically inactive.36
•
Individuals with documented CHD have 5 to 7 times the risk of having a heart 
attack or dying as the general population. Survival rates improve after a heart attack 
if treatment begins within 1 hour; however, most patients are admitted to the 
hospital 2.5 to 3 hours after symptoms begin. More than 3500 patients surveyed 
with a history of CHD were asked to identify possible symptoms of heart attack. 
Despite their history of CHD, 44% had low knowledge levels. In this group, who 
were all at high risk of future AMI, 43% assessed their risk as less than or the same 
as others their age. More men than women perceived themselves as being at low 
risk, at 47% versus 36%, respectively.37
•
Data from Worcester, MA, indicate that the average time from symptom onset to 
hospital arrival has not improved and that delays in hospital arrival are associated 
with less receipt of guidelines-based care. Mean and median prehospital delay 
times from symptom onset to arrival at the hospital were 4.1 and 2.0 hours in 1986 
and 4.6 and 2.0 hours in 2005. Compared with those arriving within 2 hours of 
symptom onset, those with prolonged prehospital delay were less likely to receive 
thrombolytic therapy and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) within 90 
minutes of hospital arrival.38
•
In an analysis from ARIC, low neighborhood household income (odds ratio [OR] 
1.46, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09 to 1.96) and being a Medicaid recipient 
(OR 1.87, 95% CI, 1.10 to 3.19) were associated with increased odds of having 
prolonged prehospital delays from symptom onset to hospital arrival for AMI 
compared with individuals with higher neighborhood household income and other 
insurance providers, respectively.39
Aftermath
•
Depending on their sex and clinical outcome, people who survive the acute stage of 
an MI have a chance of illness and death 1.5 to 15 times higher than that of the 
general population. Among these people, the risk of another MI, sudden death, AP, 
HF, and stroke—for both men and women—is substantial (FHS, NHLBI).3
•
A Mayo Clinic study found that cardiac rehabilitation after an MI is underused, 
particularly in women and the elderly. Women were 55% less likely than men to 
participate in cardiac rehabilitation, and older study patients were less likely to 
participate than younger participants. Only 32% of men and women ≥70 years of 
age participated in cardiac rehabilitation compared with 66% of those 60 to 69 
years of age and 81% of those <60 years of age.40

On the basis of pooled data from the FHS, ARIC, and CHS studies of the NHLBI, 
within 1 year after a first MI:
—
At ≥45 years of age, 19% of men and 26% of women will die.
—
At 45 to 64 years of age, 5% of white men, 9% of white women, 14% of 
black men, and 8% of black women will die.
—
At ≥65 years of age, 25% of white men, 30% of white women, 25% of 
black men, and 30% of black women will die.
—
In part because women have MIs at older ages than men, they are more 
likely to die of MIs within a few weeks.
•
Within 5 years after a first MI:
—
At ≥45 years of age, 36% of men and 47% of women will die.
—
At 45 to 64 years of age, 11% of white men, 18% of white women, 22% 
of black men, and 28% of black women will die.
—
At ≥65 years of age, 46% of white men, 53% of white women, 54% of 
black men, and 58% of black women will die.
•
Of those who have a first MI, the percentage with a recurrent MI or fatal CHD 
within 5 years is:
—
At 45 to 64 years of age, 15% of men and 22 of women.
—
At ≥65 years of age, 22% of men and women.
—
At 45 to 64 years of age, 14% of white men, 18% of white women, 22% 
of black men, and 28% of black women.
—
At ≥65 years of age, 21% of white men and women, 33% of black men, 
and 26% of black women.
•
The percentage of people with a first MI who will have HF in 5 years is:
—
At 45 to 64 years of age, 8% of men and 18% of women.
—
At ≥65 years of age, 20% of men and 23% of women.
—
At 45 to 64 years of age, 7% of white men, 15% of white women, 13% of 
black men, and 25% of black women.
—
At ≥65 years of age, 19% of white men, 23% of white women, 31% of 
black men, and 24% of black women.
•
The percentage of people with a first MI who will have a stroke within 5 years is:
—
At 45 to 64 years of age, 2% of men and 6% of women.
—
At ≥65 years of age, 5% of men and 8% of women.

At ≥65 years of age, 5% of white men, 8% of white women, 9% of black 
men, and 10% of black women.
•
The median survival time (in years) after a first MI is:
—
At 55 to 64 years of age, 17.0 for men and 13.3 for women.
—
At 65 to 74 years of age, 9.3 for men and 8.8 for women.
—
At ≥75 years of age, 3.2 for men and 3.2 for women.
•
Among survivors of an MI, in 2005, 34.7% of BRFSS respondents participated in 
outpatient cardiac rehabilitation. The prevalence of cardiac rehabilitation was 
higher among older age groups (≥50 years of age), among men versus women, 
among Hispanics, among those who were married, among those with higher 
education, and among those with higher levels of household income.41
•
A recent analysis of Medicare claims data revealed that only 13.9% of Medicare 
beneficiaries enroll in cardiac rehabilitation after an AMI, and only 31% enroll 
after CABG. Older people, women, nonwhites, and individuals with comorbidities 
were less likely to enroll in cardiac rehabilitation programs.42
Hospital Discharges and Ambulatory Care Visits—(See Table 5-1 and Chart 5-7.)
•
From 1997 to 2007, the number of inpatient discharges from short-stay hospitals 
with CHD as the first-listed diagnosis decreased from 2 090 000 to 1 572 000 
(NHDS, NCHS, NHLBI).
•
In 2008, there were 16 251 000 ambulatory care visits with CHD as the first-listed 
diagnosis (NCHS, NAMCS, NHAMCS). The majority of these visits (62.2%) were 
for coronary atherosclerosis.43
•
Age-adjusted hospitalization rate for MI was 215 per 100 000 people in 1979 to 
1981, increased to 342 in 1985 to 1987, stabilized for the next decade and then 
declined after 1996 to 242 in 2003 to 2005. Rates for men were almost twice that of 
women. Trends were similar for men and women. Hospitalization rates increased 
with age and were the highest among ≥85 years.11
•
Most hospitalized patients >65 years of age are women. For MI, 28.4% of hospital 
stays for people 45 to 64 years of age were for women, but 63.7% of stays for those 
≥85 years of age were for women. Similarly, for coronary atherosclerosis, 32.7% of 
stays among people 45 to 64 years of age were for women; this figure increased to 
60.7% of stays among those ≥85 years of age. For nonspecific chest pain, women 
were more numerous than men among patients <65 years of age. Approximately 
54.4% of hospital stays among people 45 to 64 years of age were for women. 
Women constituted 73.9% of nonspecific chest pain stays among patients ≥85 years 
of age, higher than for any other condition examined. For AMI, one third more 
women than men died in the hospital: 9.3% of women died in the hospital 
compared with 6.2% of men.44

Operations and Procedures
•
In 2007, an estimated 1 178 000 inpatient PCI procedures, 408 000 inpatient bypass 
procedures, 1 061 000 inpatient diagnostic cardiac catheterizations, 111 000 
inpatient implantable defibrillators, and 358 000 pacemaker procedures were 
performed for inpatients in the United States. (NHLBI, NCHS, unpublished 
tabulation).
Cost
•
The estimated direct and indirect cost of heart disease in 2007 is $177.5 billion. 
(MEPS, NHLBI tabulation).
•
In 2006, $11.7 billion was paid to Medicare beneficiaries for in-hospital costs when 
CHD was the principal diagnosis ($14 009 per discharge for AMI, $12 977 per 
discharge for coronary atherosclerosis, and $10 630 per discharge for other 
ischemic HD).37,45
Acute Coronary Syndrome
ICD-9 codes 410, 411.
The term acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is increasingly used to describe patients who 
present with either AMI or unstable angina (UA). (UA is chest pain or discomfort that is 
accelerating in frequency or severity and may occur while at rest but does not result in 
myocardial necrosis.) The discomfort may be more severe and prolonged than typical AP or 
may be the first time a person has AP. UA, non–ST-segment–elevation myocardial 
infarction (NSTEMI), and STEMI share common pathophysiological origins related to 
coronary plaque progression, instability, or rupture with or without luminal thrombosis and 
vasospasm.
•
A conservative estimate for the number of discharges with ACS from hospitals in 
2007 is 671 000. Of these, an estimated 384 000 are males and 287 000 are 
females. This estimate is derived by adding the first-listed inpatient hospital 
discharges for MI (577 000) to those for UA (94 000; NHDS, NHLBI).
•
When secondary discharge diagnoses in 2007 were included, the corresponding 
number of inpatient hospital discharges was 1 172 000 unique hospitalizations for 
ACS; 667 000 were males, and 505 000 were females. Of the total, 731 000 were 
for MI alone, 431 000 were for UA alone, and 10 000 hospitalizations received 
both diagnoses (NHDS, NHLBI).
Decisions about medical and interventional treatments are based on specific findings noted 
when a patient presents with ACS. Such patients are classified clinically into 1 of 3 
categories according to the presence or absence of ST-segment elevation on the presenting 
ECG and abnormal (“positive”) elevations of myocardial biomarkers such as troponins as 
follows:
•
STEMI
•
NSTEMI

The percentage of ACS or MI cases with ST-segment elevation varies in different registries/
databases and depends heavily on the age of patients included and the type of surveillance 
used. According to the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction 4 (NRMI-4), ≈29% of 
patients with MI are patients with STEMI.46 The AHA Get With The Guidelines project 
found that 32% of the patients with MI in the CAD module are patients with STEMI 
(personal communication from AHA Get With The Guidelines staff, October 1, 2007). The 
Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) study, which includes US patient 
populations, found that 38% of ACS patients have STEMI, whereas the second Euro Heart 
Survey on ACS (EHS-ACS-II) reported that ≈47% of patients with ACS have STEMI.47
In addition, the percentage of ACS or MI cases with ST-segment elevation appears to be 
declining. In an analysis of 46 086 hospitalizations for ACS in the Kaiser Permanente 
Northern California study, the percentage of MI cases with ST-segment elevation decreased 
from 48.5% to 24% between 1999 and 2008.17
•
Analysis of data from the GRACE multinational observational cohort study of 
patients with ACS found evidence of a change in practice for both pharmacological 
and interventional treatments in patients with either STEMI or NSTE ACS. These 
changes have been accompanied by significant decreases in the rates of in-hospital 
death, cardiogenic shock, and new MI among patients with non–ST-segment– 
elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE ACS). The use of evidence-based 
therapies and PCI interventions increased in the STEMI population. This increase 
was matched with a statistically significant decrease in the rates of death, 
cardiogenic shock, and HF or pulmonary edema.48
•
A study of patients with NSTE ACS treated at 350 US hospitals found that up to 
25% of opportunities to provide American College of Cardiology (ACC)/AHA 
guideline–recommended care were missed in current practice. The composite 
guideline adherence rate was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality.48
•
A study of hospital process performance in 350 centers of nearly 65 000 patients 
enrolled in the CRUSADE (Can Rapid Risk Stratification of Unstable Angina 
Patients Suppress Adverse Outcomes With Early Implementation of the ACC/AHA 
Guidelines) National Quality Improvement Initiative found that ACC/AHA 
guideline–recommended treatments were adhered to in 74% of eligible instances.49
•
After adjustment for clinical differences and the severity of CAD by angiogram, 
30-day mortality after ACS is similar in men and women.50
Angina Pectoris
ICD-9 413; ICD-10 I20. See Table 5-2 and Chart 5-5.
Prevalence
•
A study of 4 national cross-sectional health examination studies found that among 
Americans 40 to 74 years of age, the age-adjusted prevalence of AP was higher 
among women than men. Increases in the prevalence of AP occurred for Mexican

American men and women and African American women but were not statistically 
significant for the latter.51
Incidence
•
Only 18% of coronary attacks are preceded by longstanding AP (NHLBI 
computation of FHS follow-up since 1986).
•
The annual rates per 1000 population of new episodes of AP for nonblack men are 
28.3 for those 65 to 74 years of age, 36.3 for those 75 to 84 years of age, and 33.0 
for those ≥85 years of age. For nonblack women in the same age groups, the rates 
are 14.1, 20.0, and 22.9, respectively. For black men, the rates are 22.4, 33.8, and 
39.5, and for black women, the rates are 15.3, 23.6, and 35.9, respectively (CHS, 
NHLBI).7
•
On the basis of 1987 to 2001 data from the ARIC study of the NHLBI, the annual 
rates per 1000 population of new episodes of AP for nonblack men are 8.5 for those 
45 to 54 years of age, 11.9 for those 55 to 64 years of age, and 13.7 for those 65 to 
74 years of age. For nonblack women in the same age groups, the rates are 10.6, 
11.2, and 13.1, respectively. For black men, the rates are 11.8, 10.6, and 8.8, and 
for black women, the rates are 20.8, 19.3, and 10.0, respectively.7
Mortality—A small number of deaths resulting from CHD are coded as being due to AP. 
These are included as a portion of total deaths from CHD.
Cost—For women with nonobstructive CHD enrolled in the Women’s Ischemia Syndrome 
Evaluation (WISE) study of the NHLBI, the average lifetime cost estimate was ≈$770 000 
and ranged from $1.0 to $1.1 million for women with 1-vessel to 3-vessel CHD.52

6. Stroke (Cerebrovascular Disease)
ICD-9 430 to 438, ICD-10 I60 to I69. See Tables 6-1 and 6-2 and Charts 6-1 through 6-8.
Prevalence
•
An estimated 7 000 000 Americans ≥20 years of age have had a stroke 
(extrapolated to 2008 using NCHS/NHANES 2005 to 2008 data). Overall stroke 
prevalence during this period is an estimated 3.0% (see Table 6-1).
•
According to data from the 2005 BRFSS (CDC), 2.7% of men and 2.5% of women 
≥18 years of age had a history of stroke. Of those with prevalent stroke, 2.3% were 
non-Hispanic white, 4.0% were non-Hispanic black, 1.6% were Asian/Pacific 
Islander, 2.6% were Hispanic (of any race), 6.0% were American Indian/Alaska 
Native, and 4.6% were admixed.1
•
Data from the 2009 survey of the CDC/BRFSS found that, overall, 2.4% of 
respondents had been told that they had a stroke. The highest prevalence was in 
Alabama and Oklahoma (3.9%) and the lowest was in Colorado (1.4%).2
•
Among blacks ≥18 years of age, the estimated prevalence of stroke based on the 
2009 NHIS was 3.8%; among whites, it was 2.5%; and among Asians, it was 1.3%. 
Among American Indians/Alaska Natives, the prevalence of stroke is not reported 
due to its large relative standard error (NHIS, NCHS).3
•
The prevalence of silent cerebral infarction between 55 and 64 years of age is 
≈11%. This prevalence increases to 22% between 65 and 69 years of age, 28% 
between 70 and 74 years of age, 32% between 75 and 79 years of age, 40% 
between 80 and 85 years of age, and 43% at ≥85 years of age. Application of these 
rates to 1998 US population estimates results in an estimated 13 million people 
with prevalent silent stroke.4,5
•
The prevalence of stroke-related symptoms was found to be relatively high in a 
general population free of a prior diagnosis of stroke or transient ischemic attack. 
On the basis of data from 18 462 participants enrolled in a national cohort study, 
17.8% of the population >45 years of age reported at least 1 symptom. Stroke 
symptoms were more likely among blacks than whites, among those with lower 
income and lower educational attainment, and among those with fair to poor 
perceived health status. Symptoms also were more likely in participants with higher 
Framingham stroke risk score (Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in 
Stroke study [REGARDS], National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and 
Stroke [NINDS]).6
Incidence
•
Each year, ≈795 000 people experience a new or recurrent stroke. Approximately 
610 000 of these are first attacks, and 185 000 are recurrent attacks (GCNKSS, 
NINDS, and NHLBI; GCNKSS and NINDS data for 1999 provided July 9, 2008; 
estimates compiled by NHLBI). Of all strokes, 87% are ischemic, 10% are

intracerebral hemorrhage, and 3% are subarachnoid hemorrhage strokes (GCNKSS, 
NINDS, 1999).7
•
On average, every 40 seconds, someone in the United States has a stroke (AHA 
computation based on latest available data).
•
Analysis of data from the FHS study of the NHLBI suggest that stroke incidence is 
declining over time. In this largely white cohort, data from 1950 to 1977, 1978 to 
1989, and 1990 to 2004, showed that the age-adjusted incidence of first stroke per 
1000 person-years in each of the 3 periods was 7.6, 6.2, and 5.3 in men and 6.2, 
5.8, and 5.1 in women, respectively. Lifetime risk for incident stroke at 65 years of 
age decreased significantly in the latest data period compared with the first, from 
19.5% to 14.5% in men and from 18.0% to 16.1% in women. Age-adjusted stroke 
severity did not vary across periods; however, 30-day mortality rate decreased 
significantly in men (from 23% to 14%), but not in women (from 21% to 20%).8
•
As compared with the 1990s, when incidence rates of stroke were stable, data from 
2005 showed that stroke incidence was decreasing for whites but not blacks 
(GCNKSS 2005). Blacks continue to have a higher stroke incidence than whites, 
especially among young adults (GCNKSS 1999, 2005).
•
Blacks have a risk of first-ever stroke that is almost twice that of whites. The age-
adjusted stroke incidence rates in people 45 to 84 years of age are 6.6 per 1000 
population in black men, 3.6 in white men, 4.9 in black women, and 2.3 in white 
women (ARIC, NHLBI).7 On the basis of 1987 to 2001 data from the ARIC study 
sponsored by the NHLBI, stroke/ transient ischemic attack (TIA) incidence rates 
(per 1000 person-years) are 2.4 for white men 45 to 54 years of age, 6.1 for white 
men 55 to 64 years of age, and 12.2 for white men 65 to 74 years of age. For white 
women in the same age groups, the rates are 2.4, 4.8, and 9.8, respectively. For 
black men in the same age groups, the rates are 9.7, 13.1, and 16.2, and for black 
women, the rates are 7.2, 10.0, and 15.0, respectively.7
•
A study of nearly 18 000 middle-aged, predominantly white male participants in 
the Physicians’ Health Study found that the Southeast and Midwest had higher 
crude and age-standardized major CVD, total stroke, ischemic stroke, coronary 
revascularization, and CVD death incidence rates compared with the Northeast.9
•
Each year, ≈55 000 more women than men have a stroke (GCNKSS, NINDS).
•
National statistics from death certificate data have long shown an increase in deaths 
attributed to stroke for blacks because of a higher stroke incidence compared with 
whites, although the case-fatality rate is similar between the 2 racial groups. This 
racial disparity in stroke incidence does not seem to be changing over time. 
Community socioeconomic status appeared to explain 39% of the excess stroke 
incidence risk in blacks in this study.10
•
The BASIC project (NINDS) demonstrated an increased incidence of stroke among 
Mexican Americans compared with non-Hispanic whites in this community. The 
crude 3-year cumulative incidence was 168 per 10 000 in Mexican Americans and 
136 per 10 000 in non-Hispanic whites. Specifically, Mexican Americans have a

higher cumulative incidence for ischemic stroke at younger ages (45 to 59 years of 
age: RR 2.04; 95% CI, 1.55 to 2.69; 60 to 74 years of age: RR 1.58; 95% CI, 1.31 
to 1.91), but not at older ages (≥75 years of age: RR 1.12; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.32). 
Mexican Americans also have a higher incidence of intra-cerebral hemorrhage and 
subarachnoid hemorrhage than non-Hispanic whites, adjusted for age.11
•
Among 4507 American Indian participants without a prior stroke in the Strong 
Heart Study in 1989 to 1992, the age-and sex-adjusted incidence of stroke through 
2004 was 6.79 per 100 person-years, with 86% of incident strokes being 
ischemic.12
•
The age-adjusted incidence of first ischemic stroke per 100 000 was 88 in whites, 
191 in blacks, and 149 in Hispanics, according to data from the Northern 
Manhattan Study (NOMAS) (NINDS). Among blacks, compared with whites, the 
relative rate of intracranial atherosclerotic stroke was 5.85; extracranial 
atherosclerotic stroke, 3.18; lacunar stroke, 3.09; and cardioembolic stroke, 1.58. 
Among Hispanics (primarily Cuban and Puerto Rican), compared with whites, the 
relative rate of intracranial atherosclerotic stroke was 5.00; extracranial 
atherosclerotic stroke, 1.71; lacunar stroke, 2.32; and cardioembolic stroke, 1.42.13
•
Analysis of black and white patients in the Warfarin–Aspirin Symptomatic 
Intracranial Disease (WASID) trial found that blacks were significantly more likely 
to have an ischemic stroke, brain hemorrhage or vascular death, or ischemic stroke 
alone than whites.14
•
A review of published studies and data from clinical trials found that hospital 
admissions for intracerebral hemorrhage have increased by 18% in the past 10 
years, probably because of increases in the number of elderly people, many of 
whom lack adequate blood pressure control, and the increasing use of 
anticoagulants, thrombolytics, and antiplatelet agents. Mexican Americans, Latin 
Americans, blacks, Native Americans, Japanese people, and Chinese people have 
higher incidences than do white Americans.15
•
In the GCNKSS, the annual incidence of anticoagulant-associated intracerebral 
hemorrhage (AAICH) per 100 000 people was 0.8 (95% CI, 0.3 to 1.3) in 1988, 1.9 
(95% CI, 1.1 to 2.7) in 1993/1994, and 4.4 (95% CI, 3.2 to 5.5) in 1999 (P<0.001 
for trend). Among people aged ≥80, the AAICH rate increased from 2.5 (95% CI, 0 
to 7.4) in 1988 to 45.9 (95% CI, 25.6 to 66.2) in 1999 (P<0.001 for trend). 
Incidence rates of cardioembolic ischemic stroke were similar in 1993/1994 and 
1999 (31.1 versus 30.4, P=0.65). Warfarin distribution in the United States 
quadrupled on a per-capita basis between 1988 and 1999.16
Transient Ischemic Attack
•
The number of TIAs in the United States has been estimated to be ≈200 000 to 500 
000 per year, with a population prevalence of 2.3%, which translates into ≈5 
million people.17
•
The prevalence of TIA increases significantly with older age.18

•
In population-based studies, the age- and sex-adjusted incidence rates for TIA 
range from 68.2 to 83.0 per 100 000. Men, blacks and Mexican Americans have 
higher rates of TIA.11,19,
•
Meta-analyses of cohorts of patients with TIA have shown the short-term risk of 
stroke after TIA to be ≈3% to 10% at 2 days and 9% to 17% at 90 days.20,21
•
In the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial, patients with a 
first-ever hemispheric TIA had a 90-day stroke risk of 20%. The risk of stroke after 
TIA exceeded the risk after hemispheric stroke.22
•
Individuals who have a TIA have a 10-year stroke risk of roughly 19% and a 
combined 10-year stroke, MI, or vascular death risk of 43% (4%/year).23
•
Approximately 15% of all strokes are heralded by a TIA.18
•
Within 1 year of TIA, about 12% to 13% of patients will die.24,25
•
Approximately half of all patients who experience a TIA fail to report it to their 
healthcare providers.26
•
One third of episodes characterized as TIAs according to the classic definition (ie, 
focal neurological deficits that resolve within 24 hours) would be considered 
infarctions on the basis of diffusion-weighted MRI findings.27
Mortality
•
On average, every 4 minutes, someone dies of a stroke (NCHS, NHLBI).28
•
Stroke accounted for ≈1 of every 18 deaths in the United States in 2007.28
•
When considered separately from other CVDs, stroke ranks No. 3 among all causes 
of death, behind diseases of the heart and cancer (NCHS mortality data). 
Preliminary data from the CDC released on December 9, 2010, suggest that, using 
the 10th version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) and 
reclassification of some respiratory diseases, cerebrovascular disease may now rank 
No. 4 among all causes of death, after diseases of the heart, cancer, and chronic 
lower respiratory diseases.28a
•
Stroke mortality in 2007 was 135 952; any-mention mortality in 2007 was 227 215 
and the death rate was 42.2.28 See Chart 6-2 for sex/race comparison.
•
From 1997 to 2007, the annual stroke death rate decreased 34.3%, and the actual 
number of stroke deaths declined 18.8% (appropriate comparability ratios were 
applied) (NCHS Health Data Interactive Web site http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/hdi.htm 
accessed on July 15, 2010).
•
Conclusions about changes in stroke death rates from 1980 to 2005:
—
There was a greater decline in stroke death rates in men than in women, 
with a male-to-female ratio decreasing from 1.11 to 1.03 (age-adjusted).
—
There were greater declines in stroke death rates in men than in women 
among people ≥65 years of age compared with younger ages.29

•
Approximately 54% of stroke deaths in 2007 occurred out of the hospital 
(unpublished NHLBI tabulation of NCHS 2007 Mortality Data Set).
•
Among people 45 to 64 years of age, 8% to 12% of ischemic strokes and 37% to 
38% of hemorrhagic strokes result in death within 30 days, according to the ARIC 
study of the NHLBI.30
•
In a study of people ≥65 years of age recruited from a random sample of Health 
Care Financing Administration Medicare Part B eligibility lists in 4 US 
communities, the 1-month case fatality rate was 12.6% for all strokes, 8.1% for 
ischemic strokes, and 44.6% for hemorrhagic strokes.31
•
More women than men die of stroke each year due to the larger number of elderly 
women. Women accounted for 60.6% of US stroke deaths in 2007.
•
From 1995 to 1998, age-standardized mortality rates for ischemic stroke, 
subarachnoid hemorrhage, and intracerebral hemorrhage were higher among blacks 
than whites. Death rates from intracerebral hemorrhage also were higher among 
Asians/Pacific Islanders than among whites. All minority populations had higher 
death rates from subarachnoid hemorrhage than did whites. Among adults 25 to 44 
years of age, blacks and American Indians/Alaska Natives had higher risk ratios 
than did whites for all 3 stroke subtypes.32
•
In 2002, death certificate data showed that the mean age at stroke death was 79.6 
years; however, males had a younger mean age at stroke death than females. 
Blacks, American Indians/Alaska Natives, and Asians/Pacific Islanders had 
younger mean ages than whites, and the mean age at stroke death was also younger 
among Hispanics than non-Hispanics.33
•
Age-adjusted stroke mortality rates began to level off in the 1980s and stabilized in 
the 1990s for both men and women, according to the Minnesota Heart Study. 
Women had lower rates of stroke mortality than did men throughout the period. 
Some of the improvement in stroke mortality may be the result of improved acute 
stroke care, but most is thought to be the result of improved detection and treatment 
of hypertension.34
•
A report released by the CDC in collaboration with the Center for Medicare & 
Medicaid Services (CMS), the Atlas of Stroke Hospitalizations Among Medicare 
Beneficiaries, found that in Medicare beneficiaries, 30-day mortality rate varied by 
age: 9% in patients 65 to 74 years of age, 13.1% in those 74 to 84 years of age, and 
23% in those ≥85 years of age.35
•
There are substantial geographic disparities in stroke mortality with higher rates in 
the southeastern US known as the “stroke belt.” This area is usually defined to 
include the eight southern states of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, 
Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, and Arkansas. These geographic 
differences have existed since at least 194036 and despite some minor shifts,37 they 
still persist.38–40 Within the stroke belt, a “buckle” region along the coastal plain of 
North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia has been identified with even a higher

stroke mortality rate than the remainder of the stroke belt.41 The overall average 
stroke mortality is ≈20% higher in the stroke belt than in the rest of the nation and 
≈40% higher in the stroke buckle.
Stroke Risk Factors
(See Table 6-2 for data on modifiable stroke risk factors.)
•
TIAs confer a substantial short-term risk of stroke, hospitalization for CVD events, 
and death. Of 1707 TIA patients evaluated in the ED of Kaiser Permanente 
Northern California, a large integrated healthcare delivery system, 180 (10%) 
experienced a stroke within 90 days. Ninety-one patients (5%) had a stroke within 
2 days. Predictors of stroke included age >60 years, DM, focal symptoms of 
weakness or speech impairment, and TIA that lasted >10 minutes.42
•
BP is a powerful determinant of risk for both ischemic stroke and intercranial 
hemorrhage. Subjects with BP <120/80 mm Hg have approximately half the 
lifetime risk of stroke of subjects with hypertension. The treatment and lowering of 
blood pressure among hypertensive individuals was associated with a significant 
reduction in stroke risk.43
•
In REGARDS (NINDS), black participants were more aware than whites of their 
hypertension and more likely to be undergoing treatment if aware of their 
diagnosis, but among those treated for hypertension, they were less likely than 
whites to have their BP controlled. There was no evidence of a difference between 
the stroke belt and other regions in awareness of hypertension, but there was a trend 
for better treatment and BP control in the stroke belt region. The lack of substantial 
geographic differences in hypertension awareness and the trend toward better 
treatment and control in the stroke belt suggest that differences in hypertension 
management may not be a major contributor to the geographic disparity in stroke 
mortality.44
•
Impaired glucose tolerance nearly doubled the stroke risk as compared with 
patients with normal glucose levels and tripled the risks for patients with diabetes 
mellitus.45
•
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a powerful risk factor for stroke, independently increasing 
risk ≈5-fold throughout all ages. The percentage of strokes attributable to AF 
increases steeply from 1.5% at 50 to 59 years of age to 23.5% at 80 to 89 years of 
age.46,47
•
As AF is often asymptomatic48,49 and likely frequently clinically undetected,50 the 
stroke risk attributed to AF may be substantially underestimated.51 Therefore, 
although AF is an important stroke risk factor, both patients and treating physicians 
may be unaware of its presence. A related point is that no strategy to pursue normal 
sinus rhythm, including cardioversion, antiarrhythmic drug therapy and/ or 
ablation, has definitively been shown to reduce the risk of stroke.

The risk of ischemic stroke associated with current cigarette smoking has been 
shown to be approximately double that of nonsmokers after adjustment for other 
risk factors (FHS, CHS, Honolulu Heart Program [HHP], NHLBI).
•
Age-specific incidence rates and rate ratios show that diabetes increases ischemic 
stroke incidence at all ages, but this risk is most prominent before 55 years of age 
in blacks and before 65 years of age in whites. Ischemic stroke patients with DM 
are younger, more likely to be black, and more likely to have hypertension, MI, and 
high cholesterol than nondiabetic patients.52
•
In a recent ARIC/NHLBI study of a biracial population 45 to 64 years of age, with 
an average follow-up of 13.4 years, researchers found that blacks had a 3-fold 
higher multivariate- adjusted risk ratio of lacunar stroke than whites. In this middle-
aged population, the top 3 risk factors based on the population-attributable fraction 
for lacunar stroke were hypertension (population-attributable fraction, 33.9%), DM 
(26.3%), and current smoking (22.0%).53
•
In the Framingham Offspring Study, 2040 individuals free of clinical stroke had an 
MRI scan to detect silent cerebral infarct (SCI). Prevalent SCI was associated with 
the Framingham Stroke Risk Profile score (OR 1.27; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.46), 
hypertension (OR 1.56; 95% CI, 1.15 to 2.11), elevated plasma homocysteine (OR 
2.23; 95% CI, 1.42 to 3.51), AF (OR 2.16; 95% CI, 1.07 to 4.40), carotid stenosis 
>25% (OR 1.62; 95% CI, 1.13 to 2.34), and increased carotid intimal-medial 
thickness (OR 1.65; 95% CI, 1.22 to 2.24).54
•
In the FHS of the NHLBI, in participants <65 years of age, the risk of developing 
stroke/TIA was 4.2-fold higher in those with symptoms of depression. After 
adjustment for components of the Framingham Stroke Risk Profile and education, 
similar results were obtained. In subjects ≥65 years of age, use of antidepressant 
medications did not alter the risk associated with depressive symptoms. 
Identification of depressive symptoms at younger ages may have an impact on the 
primary prevention of stroke.55
•
Data from the HHP/NHLBI found that in Japanese men 71 to 93 years of age, low 
concentrations of HDL cholesterol were more likely to be associated with a future 
risk of thromboembolic stroke than were high concentrations.56
Risk Factor Issues Specific to Women
•
Analysis of NHANES 1999 to 2004 data found that women 45 to 54 years of age 
are more than twice as likely as men to have had a stroke. Women in the 45- to 54-
year age group had a >4-fold higher likelihood of having had a stroke than women 
35 to 44 years of age.57
•
Women are older at stroke onset compared with men (75 years compared with 71 
years).58
•
Women have lower age-adjusted stroke incidence than men; however, sex 
differences in stroke risk are modified by age. Data from Framingham demonstrate 
that compared with white men, white women 45 to 84 years have lower stroke risk

than men, but this association is reversed in older ages such that women greater 
than 85 years have elevated risk compared with men.58 Similarly, a population-
based study in Sweden found stroke incidence to be 60% lower for women than 
men at ages 55 to 64 years, but by 75 years of age this association reversed and 
women had a 50% higher incidence than men.59 The Oxford Vascular Study also 
showed lower stroke incidence for women than men aged 55 to 74 years, but higher 
incidence for women aged 85 years and older.60
•
Lifetime risk of stroke is greater in women compared with men because of their 
greater life expectancy and the fact that stroke rates increase substantially with 
age.61
•
Overall, randomized clinical trial data indicate that the use of estrogen plus 
progestin, as well as estrogen alone, increases stroke risk in postmenopausal, 
generally healthy women and provides no protection for women with established 
HD.62,63
•
Among postmenopausal women who were generally healthy, the Women’s Health 
Initiative (WHI), a randomized trial of 16 608 women (95% of whom had no 
preexisting CVD), found that estrogen plus progestin increased ischemic stroke risk 
by 44%, with no effect on hemorrhagic stroke. The excess risk was apparent in all 
age groups, in all categories of baseline stroke risk, and in women with and without 
hypertension or prior history of CVD.62
•
In the WHI trial, among 10 739 women with hysterectomy, it was found that 
conjugate equine estrogen alone increased the risk of ischemic stroke by 55% and 
that there was no significant effect on hemorrhagic stroke. The excess risk of total 
stroke conferred by estrogen alone was 12 additional strokes per 10 000 person-
years.64
•
In postmenopausal women with known CHD, the Heart and Estrogen/Progestin 
Replacement Study (HERS), a secondary CHD prevention trial, found that a 
combination of estrogen plus progestin (conjugated equine estrogen [0.625 mg] and 
medroxyprogesterone acetate [2.5 mg]) hormone therapy did not reduce stroke 
risk.65
•
The Women’s Estrogen for Stroke Trial (WEST) found that estrogen alone (1 mg 
of 17β-estradiol) in women with a mean age of 71 years also had no significant 
overall effect on recurrent stroke or fatality, but there was an increased rate of fatal 
stroke and an early increase in overall stroke rate in the first 6 months of therapy.66
•
Analysis of data from the FHS found that women with menopause at 42 to 54 years 
of age and at ≥55 years of age had lower stroke risk compared with those with 
menopause <42 years of age, even after adjustment for potential confounders. 
Women with menopause before 42 years of age had twice the stroke risk compared 
with all other women in different age groups.67
•
The preponderance of evidence supports an increased risk of ischemic stroke 
among users of low-estrogen oral contraception.68–70 An increased relative risk of 
1.93 (95% CI, 1.35 to 2.74) was found for low-estrogen preparations in population-

based studies that controlled for smoking and hypertension. This translates to an 
additional 4.1 ischemic strokes per 100 000 nonsmoking, normotensive women 
using low-estrogen oral contraceptives, or 1 additional ischemic stroke per year per 
24 000 such women.69
•
The risk of ischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage during pregnancy and the 
first 6 weeks postpartum was 2.4 times greater than for nonpregnant women of 
similar age and race, according to the Baltimore-Washington Cooperative Young 
Stroke Study. The risk of ischemic stroke during pregnancy was not increased 
during pregnancy per se but was increased 8.7-fold during the 6 weeks postpartum. 
Intracerebral hemorrhage showed a small RR of 2.5 during pregnancy but increased 
dramatically to an RR of 28.3 in the 6 weeks postpartum. The excess risk of stroke 
(all types except subarachnoid hemorrhage) attributable to the combined 
pregnancy/postpregnancy period was 8.1 per 100 000 pregnancies.71
•
In the US Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 2000 to 2001, the rate of events per 
100 000 pregnancies was 9.2 for ischemic stroke, 8.5 for intracerebral hemorrhage, 
0.6 for cerebral venous thrombosis, and 15.9 for the ill-defined category of 
pregnancy-related cerebrovascular events, for a total rate of 34.2 per 100 000, not 
including subarachnoid hemorrhage. The risk was increased in blacks and among 
older women. Death occurred during hospitalization in 4.1% of women with these 
events and in 22% of survivors after discharge to a facility other than home.72
•
Preeclampsia is a risk factor for ischemic stroke remote from pregnancy.73 The 
subsequent stroke risk of preeclampsia may be mediated by a 3.6 to 6.1-fold higher 
later risk of hypertension and a 3.1 to 3.7-fold higher later risk of diabetes mellitus, 
depending on whether the preeclampsia was mild or severe.74
Physical Inactivity as a Risk Factor for Stroke
Higher levels of physical activity are associated with lower stroke risk. This relationship has 
been consistently demonstrated in prospective and case-control studies conducted in the 
United States as well as in a variety of other populations.
•
Results from the Physicians’ Health Study showed a 14% lower RR of stroke 
associated with vigorous exercise (exercise ≥5 times per week) among men.75
•
The Harvard Alumni Study showed that men who were highly physically active 
had an 18% lower RR of total stroke.76
•
In the Women’s Health Study, a dose-response relationship between level of 
leisure-time walking time and pace and risk of stroke was demonstrated, with 
higher levels of activity associated with 20% to 40% reduction in risk.77
•
In NOMAS, a prospective cohort that included white, black, and Hispanic men and 
women in an urban setting who were followed for a median of 9 years, baseline 
physical activity was associated with an overall 35% reduction in risk of ischemic 
stroke.78

•
In this analysis, an interaction between sex and activity intensity was seen, with 
moderate to heavy activity associated with a 60% reduction in risk of ischemic 
stroke in men, but no association was seen in women.78
•
The NOMAS study found that only moderate to vigorous intensity exercise was 
associated with reduced stroke incidence, whereas light exercise (such as walking) 
showed no benefit.78
•
In a subanalysis of data from the ARIC study, blacks reporting sports-related 
activity had a 40% reduced risk of subclinical MRI-detected cerebral infarct after 6 
years of follow-up.79
•
In contrast to studies showing little or no benefit at lower levels of exercise,78,81–82 
several reports indicate a protective effect of relatively light exposure. After a 
median of 16 years of follow-up in the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT),83 a 
single weekly episode of vigorous exercise was associated with a 50% reduction in 
the risk of dying from stroke in men, with no additional benefit seen with more 
frequent exercise. Recent findings from the Women’s Health Study77 also 
demonstrated an inverse association between stroke incidence and walking, but no 
clear relationship with vigorous-intensity activity.
•
Timing of physical activity in relation to stroke onset has also been examined in 
several studies. In a hospital-based case-control study from Heidelberg, Germany, 
recent activity (within the prior months) was associated with reduced odds of 
having a stroke or transient ischemic attack, whereas sports activity during young 
adulthood that was not continued showed no benefit.84 In a Danish case-control 
study, ischemic stroke patients were less physically active in the week preceding 
the stroke compared with age-and sex-matched controls, with the highest activity 
scores associated with greatest reduction in odds of stroke.85
Awareness of Stroke Warning Signs and Risk Factors
•
Correct knowledge of at least 1 stroke warning sign increased from 48% in 1995 to 
68% in 2000, with no significant improvement to 2005 (68%) based on a telephone 
survey conducted in a biracial population in the greater Cincinnati/Northern 
Kentucky region. Knowledge of 3 correct warning signs was low, but increased 
over time; 5.4% in 1995, 12.0% in 2000, and 15.7% in 2005. Knowledge of at least 
1 stroke risk factor increased from 59% in 1995% to 71% in 2000, but there was 
not improvement to 2005 (71%). Only 3.6% of those surveyed were able to 
independently identify tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) as an available drug 
therapy and only 9% of these were able to identify a window of <3 hours for 
treatment.86
•
In the 2005 BRFSS among respondents in 14 states, 38.1% were aware of 5 stroke 
warning symptoms and would first call 9-1-1 if they thought that someone was 
having a heart attack or stroke. Awareness of all 5 stroke warning symptoms and 
calling 9-1-1 was higher among whites versus blacks and Hispanics (41.3%, 29.5%, 
and 26.8%, respectively), women versus men (41.5% versus 34.5%), and people 
with higher versus lower educational attainment (47.6% for people with a college

degree or more versus 22.5% for those who had not received a high school 
diploma). Among states, the same measure ranged from 27.9% (Oklahoma) to 
49.7% (Minnesota).87
•
A study was conducted of patients admitted to an ED with possible stroke to 
determine their knowledge of the signs, symptoms, and risk factors of stroke. Of 
the 163 patients able to respond, 39% did not know a single sign or symptom. 
Patients ≥65 years of age were less likely than those <65 years old to know a sign 
or symptom of stroke (28% versus 47%), and 43% did not know a single risk 
factor. Overall, almost 40% of patients did not know the signs, symptoms, and risk 
factors of stroke.88
•
Among patients recruited from the Academic Medical Center Consortium, the 
CHS, and United HealthCare, only 41% were aware of their increased risk for 
stroke. Approximately 74% recalled being told of their increased stroke risk by a 
physician, compared with 28% who did not recall this. Younger patients, depressed 
patients, those in poor current health, and those with a history of TIA were most 
likely to be aware of their risk.89
•
An AHA-sponsored random-digit dialing telephone survey was conducted in 
mid-2003. Only 26% of women >65 years of age reported being well informed 
about stroke. Correct identification of the warning signs of stroke was low among 
all age and racial/ethnic groups.90
•
Among participants in a study by the National Stroke Association, 2.3% reported 
having been told by a physician that they had had a TIA. Of those with a TIA, only 
64% saw a physician within 24 hours of the event, only 8.2% correctly related the 
definition of TIA, and 8.6% could identify a typical symptom. Men, people of 
color, and those with lower income and fewer years of education were less likely to 
be knowledgeable about TIA.19
•
In 2004, 800 adults ≥45 years of age were surveyed to assess their perceived risk 
for stroke and their history of stroke risk factors. Overall, 39% perceived 
themselves to be at risk. Younger age, current smoking, a history of DM, high BP, 
high cholesterol, HD, and stroke/TIA were independently associated with perceived 
risk for stroke. Respondents with AF were no more likely to report being at risk 
than were respondents without AF. Perceived risk for stroke increased as the 
number of risk factors increased; however, 46% of those with ≥3 risk factors did 
not perceive themselves to be at risk.91
•
A study of patients who have had a stroke found that only 60.5% were able to 
accurately identify 1 stroke risk factor and that 55.3% were able to identify 1 stroke 
symptom. Patients’ median delay time from onset of symptoms to admission in the 
ED was 16 hours, and only 31.6% accessed the ED in <2 hours. Analysis showed 
that the appearance of nonmotor symptoms as the primary symptom and nonuse of 
the 9-1-1 system were significant predictors of delay >2 hours. Someone other than 
the patient made the decision to seek treatment in 66% of the cases.92

Spanish-speaking Hispanics are less likely to know all stroke symptoms than 
English-speaking Hispanics, non-Hispanic blacks, and non-Hispanic whites. Lack 
of English proficiency is strongly associated with lack of stroke knowledge among 
Hispanics.93
Aftermath
Stroke is a leading cause of serious, long-term disability in the United States (Survey of 
Income and Program Participation, a survey of the US Bureau of the Census).94
•
Data from the BRFSS (CDC) 2005 survey on stroke survivors in 21 states and the 
District of Columbia found that 30.7% of stroke survivors received outpatient 
rehabilitation. The findings indicated that the prevalence of stroke survivors 
receiving outpatient stroke rehabilitation was lower than would be expected if 
clinical practice guideline recommendations for all stroke patients had been 
followed.
•
On the basis of pooled data from the FHS, ARIC, and CHS studies of the NHLBI:
—
The proportions of patients dead 1 year after a first stroke were as 
follows:
◦
At ≥45 years of age: 28% of men and 32% of women
◦
At 45 to 64 years of age: 16% of white men, 21% of white 
women, 19% of black men, and 19% of black women
◦
At ≥65 years of age: 31% of white men, 35% of white women, 
27% of black men, and 29% of black women
—
The proportions of patients dead within 5 years after a first stroke were as 
follows:
◦
At ≥45 years of age: 52% of men and 56% of women
◦
At 45 to 64 years of age: 27% of white men, 31% of white 
women, 36% of black men, and 42% of black women
◦
At ≥65 years of age: 58% of white men, 61% of white women, 
52% of black men, and 53% of black women
—
Of those who have a first stroke, the proportions with a recurrent stroke in 
5 years were as follows:
◦
At 45 to 64 years of age: 10% of men and 20% of women
◦
At ≥65 years of age: 20% of men and 25% of women
◦
At 45 to 64 years of age: 13% of white men, 15% of white 
women, 6% of black men, and 23% of black women
◦
At ≥65 years of age: 21% of white men, 25% of white women, 
12% of black men, and 23% of black women

The length of time to recover from a stroke depends on its severity. Between 50% 
and 70% of stroke survivors regain functional independence, but 15% to 30% are 
permanently disabled, and 20% require institutional care at 3 months after onset.96
•
In the NHLBI’s FHS, among ischemic stroke survivors who were ≥65 years of age, 
these disabilities were observed at 6 months after stroke97:
—
50% had some hemiparesis
—
30% were unable to walk without some assistance
—
26% were dependent in activities of daily living (ADLs)
—
19% had aphasia
—
35% had depressive symptoms
—
26% were institutionalized in a nursing home
•
Black stroke survivors had greater activity limitations than did white stroke 
survivors, according to data from the NHIS (2000 to 2001, NCHS) as analyzed by 
the CDC.98
•
After stroke, women have greater disability than men. A Michigan-based stroke 
registry found that 33% of women had moderate to severe disability (modified 
Rankin score ≥4) at discharge, compared with 27% of men. In a study of 108 stroke 
survivors from FHS, 34% of women were disabled at 6 months (Barthel Index [BI] 
<60), compared with 16% of men. In the Kansas City Stroke Study, women had a 
30% lower probability of achieving independence (BI ≥95) by 6 months compared 
with men. In the Michigan registry, women had a 63% lower probability of 
achieving ADL independence (BI ≥95) 3 months after discharge.97,99–101
Hospital Discharges/Ambulatory Care Visits
•
From 1997 to 2007, the number of inpatient discharges from short-stay hospitals 
with stroke as the first listed diagnosis declined from 1 018 000 to 829 000 (NHDS, 
NCHS). Most of the decrease was observed in men and women ≥65 years of age. 
(NHLBI tabulation, NHDS, NCHS)
•
In 2005, there was a hospitalization rate of 77.3 stays per 10 000 people >45 years 
of age for cerebrovascular disease. There has been a decline in the hospitalization 
rate for different types of cerebrovascular disease between 1997 and 2005, with the 
exception of hemorrhagic stroke. Between 1997 and 2005, the hospitalization rate 
for ischemic stroke decreased by 34%, from 54.4 to 35.9 stays per 10 000 people. 
The hospitalization rate for transient cerebral ischemia also decreased ≈23%

during this period. Similarly, the hospitalization rate for occlusion or stenosis of 
precerebral arteries steadily decreased by 30% between 1997 and 2005, from 18.4 
to 12.8 stays per 10 000 people. In contrast, the hospitalization rate for hemorrhagic 
stroke remained relatively stable during this period.102
•
Data from 2007 from the Hospital Discharge Survey of the NCHS showed that the 
average length of stay for discharges with stroke as the first-listed diagnosis was 
5.3 days.
•
In 2003, men and women accounted for roughly the same number of hospital stays 
for stroke in the 18- to 44-year age group. After 65 years of age, women were the 
majority. Among people 65 to 84 years of age, 54.5% of stroke patients were 
women, whereas among the oldest age group, women constituted 69.7% of all 
stroke patients.103
•
A first-ever county-level Atlas of Stroke Hospitalizations Among Medicare 
Beneficiaries was released in 2008 by the CDC in collaboration with the CMS. It 
found that the stroke hospitalization rate for blacks was 27% higher than for the US 
population in general, 30% higher than for whites, and 36% higher than for 
Hispanics. In contrast to whites and Hispanics, the highest percentage of strokes in 
blacks (42.3%) occurred in the youngest Medicare age group (65 to 74 years of 
age).35
•
In 2008, the number of ambulatory care visits with stroke as the first-listed 
diagnosis was 3 726 000 (NAMCS, NHAMCS/NCHS).104
Stroke in Children
•
On the basis of pathogenic differences, pediatric strokes are typically classified as 
either perinatal, occurring at ≤28 days of life and including in utero strokes, or 
(later) childhood.
•
Recent estimates of the overall annual incidence of stroke in US children are 6.4 
per 100 000 children (0 to 15 years) in 1999 in GCNKSS105 and 4.6 per 100 000 
children (0 to 19 years) from 1997 to 2003 Kaiser Permanente of Northern 
California (KPNC), a large integrated healthcare delivery system.106 
Approximately half of incident childhood strokes are hemorrhagic.107
•
The prevalence of perinatal strokes is 29 per 100 000 live births, or one per 3500 
live births in the 1997 to 2003 KPNC population.106
•
A history of infertility, preeclampsia, prolonged rupture of membranes, and 
chorioamnionitis were found to be independent risk factors for perinatal arterial 
ischemic stroke in KPNC. The RR of perinatal stroke increased ≈25-fold, with an 
absolute risk of 1 per 200 deliveries, when ≥3 of antenatally determined risk factors 
were present.108
•
Although children with sickle cell disease and congenital HD are at high risk for 
ischemic stroke, the most common cause in a previously healthy child is a cerebral 
arteriopathy, found in approximately two thirds of cases.109

•
Thrombophilias (genetic and acquired) are risk factors for childhood stroke, with 
summary ORs ranging from 1.6 to 8.8 in a recent meta-analysis.110
•
From 1979 to 1998 in the United States, childhood mortality resulting from stroke 
declined by 58% overall, with reductions in all major subtypes.111
•
The incidence of stroke in children has been stable over the past 10 years, whereas 
the 30-day case fatality rates were 18% in 1988 to 1989, 9% in 1993 to 1994, and 
9% in 1999 in the GCNKSS population. The previously reported nationwide 
decrease in overall stroke mortality in children might be due to decreasing case 
fatality after stroke and not decreasing stroke incidence.105
•
Compared with girls, boys have a 1.28-fold higher risk of stroke.112 Compared 
with white children, black children have a 2-fold risk of both incident stroke and 
death from stroke.111,112 The increased risk among blacks is not fully explained by 
the presence of sickle cell disease, nor is the excess risk among boys fully 
explained by trauma.112
•
At a mean follow-up time of 2.1 years, 37% of 123 childhood ischemic stroke 
survivors had full recovery, 20% had mild deficits, 26% had moderate deficits, and 
16% had severe deficits.113 Concomitant involvement of the basal ganglia, cerebral 
cortex, and posterior limb of the internal capsule predicts a persistent 
hemiparesis.114
•
After adjusting for routine healthcare costs, the average 5-year cost of a neonatal 
stroke was $51 719 and of a childhood stroke was $135 161. Costs in children with 
stroke continued to exceed that in age-matched control children even in the fifth 
year by an average of $2016.115
•
Despite current treatment, 1 of 10 children with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke 
will have a recurrence within 5 years.116,117 The 5-year recurrence risk is as high as 
60% among children with cerebral arteriopathy. The recurrence risk after perinatal 
stroke, however, is negligible.118
•
Sickle cell disease is the most important cause of ischemic stroke among black 
children. The Stroke Prevention Trial in Sickle Cell Anemia (STOP), reported in 
1998, demonstrated the efficacy (reduction of stroke from 10% per year to <1%) of 
blood transfusions for primary stroke prevention in high-risk children with sickle 
cell disease identified by transcranial Doppler. First-admission rates for stroke in 
California among children with sickle cell disease showed a dramatic decline 
subsequent to the publication of the STOP study.119
•
A second randomized clinical trial, STOP II, demonstrated that stopping 
transfusions after 30 months of treatment was associated with a high risk of 
stroke.120
Barriers to Stroke Care
•
Based on NHIS data, the inability to afford medications among stroke survivors 
increased significantly from 8.1% to 12.7% between 1997 to 2004, totaling 76 000

US stroke survivors in 2004. Compared with stroke survivors able to afford 
medications, those unable more frequently reported lack of transportation, no 
health insurance, no usual place of care, income <$20 000 and out-of-pocket 
medical expenses ≥$2000.121
•
In 2002, ≈21% of US counties did not have a hospital, 31% lacked a hospital with 
an ED, and 77% did not have a hospital with neurological services.122
•
Of patients with ischemic stroke in the California Acute Stroke Pilot Registry, 
23.5% arrived at the ED within 3 hours of symptom onset, and 4.3% received 
thrombolysis. If all patients had called 9-1-1 immediately, the expected overall rate 
of thrombolytic treatment within 3 hours would have increased to 28.6%. If all 
patients with known onset had arrived within 1 hour and had been optimally 
treated, 57% could have received thrombolytic treatment.123
•
Data from the Paul Coverdell National Acute Stroke Registry were analyzed from 
the 142 hospitals that participated in the 4 registry states. More patients were 
transported by ambulance than by other means (43.6%). Time of stroke symptom 
onset was recorded for 44.8% of the patients. Among these patients, 48% arrived at 
the ED within 2 hours of symptom onset. Significantly fewer blacks (42.4%) 
arrived within 2 hours of symptom onset than did whites (49.5%), and significantly 
fewer nonambulance patients (36.2%) arrived within 2 hours of symptom onset 
than did patients transported by ambulance (58.6%). The median arrival time for all 
patients with known time of onset was 2.0 hours. Sixty-five percent of patients who 
arrived at the ED within 2 hours of onset received imaging within 1 hour of ED 
arrival. Significantly fewer women (62%) received imaging within 1 hour of ED 
arrival than men.124
•
A comprehensive statewide survey of hospital-based stroke prevention and 
treatment capabilities conducted in all emergent stroke care hospitals in North 
Carolina in 1998, 2003, and 2008 found that the proportion of hospitals offering 
certain stroke-related diagnostic tests increased over the 10-year period, with 
significant increases in CT angiography and diffusion-weighted MRI, but not 
catheter angiography. Sixteen hospitals received Joint Commission certification as 
Primary Stroke Centers, servicing 41% of the state’s population based on county of 
residence. In 2008, 96% of hospitals provided CT imaging, 59% provided 
diffusion-weighted MRI, 57% had a neurologist on staff, 69% had a tPA protocol, 
and 27% had a stroke team. Despite increases in the accessibility of specific 
diagnostic tests and improvements in hospitals’ organizational features, there were 
no major differences in hospitals’ offerings of stroke education programs in their 
communities.125
•
NHIS data from 1998 to 2002 found that younger stroke survivors (45 to 64 years) 
self-reported worse access to physician care and medication affordability than older 
stroke survivors. Compared with older patients, younger stroke survivors were 
more likely to be male (47% versus 52%), black (10% versus 19%), and to lack 
health insurance (0.4% versus 11%). Lack of health insurance was associated with 
reduced access to care.126

•
Data from 142 hospitals participating in the Paul Coverdell National Acute Stroke 
Registry found that fewer than 48% of stroke patients arrived at the ED within 2 
hours of symptom onset in 2005 to 2006. Blacks were less likely to arrive within 
the 2-hour window compared with whites (42.4% versus 49.5%). Among those 
arriving within 2 hours, 65.2% received imaging within 1 hour of ED arrival; 
significantly fewer women received imaging within 1 hour as compared with men 
(62.9% versus 67.6%), but no differences were observed by racial group.127
•
Results from the Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) project 
found that women were less likely to arrive at the ED within 3 hours of stroke 
symptom onset than men (OR 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5 to 0.9). Mexican Americans were 
40% less likely to arrive by EMS than non-Hispanic whites, even after adjustment 
for age, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), education, history of 
stroke, and insurance status. Language fluency was not associated with time to 
hospital arrival or use of EMS. The receipt of tPA was low (1.5%), but did not 
differ by sex or race.128
•
A national study of Academic Medical Centers found no change in the proportion 
of patients with stroke arriving at hospitals within 2 hours of symptom onset 
between 2001 and 2004 (37% versus 38%); however, the rate of IV tPA use 
increased over this time period (14% to 38%), suggesting system-level 
improvements in the organization of in-hospital care. In risk-adjusted analyses, 
black patients were 45% less likely to arrive within 2 hours compared with white 
patients.129
•
Receipt of time-sensitive interventions such as fibrinolytic therapy for acute stroke 
is contingent on access to an appropriately staffed emergency department. In 2003, 
71% of the US population had access to an ED within 30 minutes, and 98% within 
60 minutes. Access to teaching hospitals was more limited (16% within 30 minutes, 
44% within 60 minutes). Although the majority of the US population had access to 
an ED within 60 minutes, rural states had lower access to all types of EDs, 
indicating geographic heterogeneity in rapid access to emergency care; 30-minute 
access ranged from 48% in Vermont to 86% in the District of Columbia.130
•
A study of 55 094 US veterans with ischemic stroke from 1990 to 1997 found 
substantial geographic variation in inpatient and outpatient healthcare utilization 
and outcomes. Patients in the Northeast and West were 30% more likely than those 
in the Midwest and South to have a neurology and/or general medicine clinic visit 
within 60 days of discharge and were also more likely to have both neurology and 
general medicine follow-up within 1 year. Mortality was lower in regions where 
more patients had early outpatient care after stroke.131
•
Patients with a discharge diagnosis of ischemic stroke were identified in 7 
California hospitals participating in the California Acute Stroke Pilot Registry. Six 
points of care were tracked: thrombolysis, receipt of antithrombotic medications 
within 48 hours, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, smoking cessation 
counseling, and prescription of lipid-lowering and antithrombotic medications at 
discharge. Overall, rates of optimal treatment improved for patients treated in year

2 versus year 1, with 63% receiving a perfect score in year 2 versus 44% in year 1. 
Rates improved significantly in 4 of the 6 hospitals and for 4 of the 6 interventions. 
A seventh hospital that participated in the registry but did not implement 
standardized orders showed no improvement in optimal treatment.132
Operations and Procedures
Among stroke or TIA patients with high-grade carotid stenosis, carotid endarterectomy has 
been the recommended treatment for the prevention of stroke, whereas carotid stenting has 
been proposed as a therapeutic option for patients at high risk for surgical revascularization.
•
In 2005, a total of 66 698 eligible Medicare beneficiaries underwent carotid 
endarterectomy and 7357 underwent carotid stenting.
•
There is substantial geographic variation in the age-adjusted rates of carotid 
endarterectomy, with a nearly nine-fold difference between the highest rate and the 
lowest rate.
•
The rate of carotid endarterectomy decreased slightly from 2003 (3.2 per 1000 
person-years) to 2006 (2.7 per 1000 person-years).
•
From 2001 to 2006, there was a significant increase in the use of carotid imaging 
among Medicare beneficiaries, along with a concurrent decrease in the use of 
carotid revascularization procedures.
•
In 2007, an estimated 91 000 inpatient endarterectomy procedures were performed 
in the United States. Carotid endarterectomy is the most frequently performed 
surgical procedure to prevent stroke. (NHDS, NCHS, NHLBI tabulation).
•
Although rates of carotid endarterectomy in the Medicare population slightly 
decreased between 1998 and 2004, the use of carotid artery stenting dramatically 
increased.133 (see Chart 6-8)
•
The randomized Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial 
(CREST) compared carotid endarterectomy and stenting for symptomatic and 
asymptomatic carotid stenosis. There was no overall difference in the primary end 
point of stroke, myocardial infarction, or death. However, carotid endarterectomy 
showed superiority with increasing age, with the crossover point at approximately 
age 70, and was associated with fewer strokes, which had a greater impact on 
quality of life than MI.134
Cost
The direct and indirect cost of stroke in 2007 was $40.9 billion. (MEPS, NHLBI tabulation)
•
The estimated direct medical cost of stroke for 2007 is $25.2 billion. This includes 
hospital outpatient or officebased provider visits, hospital inpatient stays, 
emergency room visits, prescribed medicines, and home health.134
•
The mean expenses per person for stroke care in the United States in 2007 was 
estimated at $7657.135

•
The mean lifetime cost of ischemic stroke in the United States is estimated at $140 
048. This includes inpatient care, rehabilitation, and follow-up care necessary for 
lasting deficits. (All numbers were converted to 1999 dollars by use of the medical 
component of the Consumer Price Index.)136
•
The estimated cost of acute pediatric stoke in the United Sates is $42 million in 
2003. The mean cost of short-term hospital care was $20 927 per discharge.137
•
In a study of stroke costs within 30 days of an acute event between 1987 to 1989 in 
the Rochester Stroke Study, the average cost was $13 019 for mild ischemic strokes 
and $20 346 for severe ischemic strokes (4 or 5 on the Rankin Disability Scale).138
•
Inpatient hospital costs for an acute stroke event account for 70% of first-year 
poststroke costs.106
•
The largest components of short-term-care costs were room charges (50%), medical 
management (21%), and diagnostic costs (19%).139
•
Death within 7 days, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and stroke while hospitalized for 
another condition are associated with higher costs in the first year. Lower costs are 
associated with mild cerebral infarctions or residence in a nursing home before the 
stroke.138
•
Demographic variables (age, sex, and insurance status) are not associated with 
stroke cost. Severe strokes (NIHSS score >20) cost twice as much as mild strokes, 
despite similar diagnostic testing. Comorbidities such as ischemic HD and AF 
predict higher costs.139,140
•
The total cost of stroke from 2005 to 2050, in 2005 dollars, is projected to be $1.52 
trillion for non-Hispanic whites, $313 billion for Hispanics, and $379 billion for 
blacks. The per capita cost of stroke estimates is highest in blacks ($25 782), 
followed by Hispanics ($17 201) and non-Hispanic whites ($15 597). Loss of 
earnings is expected to be the highest cost contributor in each race/ethnic group.141

ICD-9 401 to 404, ICD-10 I10 to I15. See Tables 7-1 and 7-2 and Charts 7-1 through 7-5.
Prevalence
•
HBP is defined as:
—
SBP ≥140 mm Hg or DBP ≥90 mm Hg or taking antihypertensive 
medicine, or
—
Having been told at least twice by a physician or other health professional 
that one has HBP.
•
One in 3 US adults has HBP.1
•
Data from NHANES 1999 to 2006 found that ≈8% of US adults have undiagnosed 
hypertension.2
•
An estimated 76 400 000 adults ≥20 years of age have HBP, extrapolated to 2008 
with NHANES 2005 to 2008 data (Table 7-1).
•
NHANES data show that a higher percentage of men than women have 
hypertension until 45 years of age. From 45 to 54 and from 55 to 64 years of age, 
the percentages of men and women with hypertension are similar. After that, a 
higher percentage of women have hypertension than men.3
•
HBP is 2 to 3 times more common in women taking oral contraceptives, especially 
among obese and older women, than in women not taking them.4
•
Data from NHANES 2005 to 2006 found that 29% of US adults ≥18 years of age 
were hypertensive. The prevalence of hypertension was nearly equal between men 
and women; 7% of adults had HBP but had never been told that they had 
hypertension. Among hypertensive adults, 78% were aware of their condition, 68% 
were using antihypertensive medication, and 64% of those treated had their 
hypertension controlled.5
•
Data from the 2009 BRFSS/CDC indicate that the percentage of adults ≥18 years of 
age who had been told that they had HBP ranged from 21.6% in Minnesota to 
37.6% in West Virginia. The median percentage was 28.7%.6
Older Adults
•
In 2007 to 2008, diagnosed chronic conditions that were more prevalent among 
older women than men included hypertension (58% for women, 53% for men). 
Ever-diagnosed conditions that were more prevalent among older men than older 
women included HD (38% for men, 27% for women) and DM (20% for men, 18% 
for women) based on data from NHIS/NCHS.7
•
The age-adjusted prevalence of hypertension (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) in 
2003 to 2006 was 75% for older women and 65% for older men on the basis of data 
from NHANES/NCHS.8

Children and Adolescents
•
Analysis of NHES, Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(HHANES), and NHANES/NCHS surveys of the NCHS (1963–2002) found that 
the BP, pre-HBP, and HBP trends in children and adolescents 8 to 17 years of age 
moved downward from 1963 to 1988 and upward thereafter. Pre-HBP and HBP 
increased 2.3% and 1%, respectively, between 1988 and 1999. Increased obesity 
(more so abdominal obesity than general obesity) partially explained the HBP and 
pre-HBP rise from 1988 to 1999. BP and HBP reversed their downward trends 10 
years after the increase in the prevalence of obesity. In addition, an ethnic and sex 
gap appeared in 1988 for pre-HBP and in 1999 for HBP: Non-Hispanic blacks and 
Mexican Americans had a greater prevalence of HBP and pre-HBP than non-
Hispanic whites, and the prevalence was greater in boys than in girls. In that study, 
HBP in children and adolescents was defined as SBP or DBP that was, on repeated 
measurement, ≥95th percentile.9
•
A study in Ohio of >14 000 children and adolescents 3 to 18 years of age who were 
observed at least 3 times between 1999 and 2006 found that 3.6% had 
hypertension. Of these, 26% had been diagnosed and 74% were undiagnosed. In 
addition, 3% of those with hypertension had stage 2 hypertension, and 41% of 
those with stage 2 hypertension were undiagnosed. Criteria for prehypertension 
were met by 485 children. Of these, 11% were diagnosed. In this study, HBP in 
children and adolescents was defined as SBP or DBP that was, on repeated 
measurement, ≥95th percentile.10
•
A study from 1988 to 1994 through 1999 to 2000 of children and adolescents 8 to 
17 years of age showed that among non-Hispanic blacks, mean SBP levels 
increased by 1.6 mm Hg among girls and by 2.9 mm Hg among boys compared 
with non-Hispanic whites. Among Mexican Americans, girls’ SBP increased 1.0 
mm Hg and boys’ SBP increased 2.7 mm Hg compared with non-Hispanic 
whites.11
•
Analysis of data from the Search for Diabetes in Youth Study (SEARCH), which 
included children 3 to 17 years of age with type 1 and type 2 DM, found the 
prevalence of elevated BP among those with type 1 DM to be 5.9% and the 
prevalence of elevated BP among those with type 2 DM to be 23.7%.12
Race/Ethnicity and HBP
•
The prevalence of hypertension in blacks in the United States is among the highest 
in the world, and it is increasing. From 1988 to 1994 through 1999 to 2002, the 
prevalence of HBP in adults increased from 35.8% to 41.4% among blacks, and it 
was particularly high among black women at 44.0%. Prevalence among whites also 
increased, from 24.3% to 28.1%.13
•
Compared with whites, blacks develop HBP earlier in life, and their average BPs 
are much higher. As a result, compared with whites, blacks have a 1.3-times greater 
rate of nonfatal stroke, a 1.8-times greater rate of fatal stroke, a 1.5-times greater 
rate of death due caused by HD, and a 4.2-times greater rate of end-stage kidney

disease (Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and 
Treatment of High Blood Pressure 5 and 6).
•
Within the black community, rates of hypertension vary substantially.13,14
—
Those with the highest rates are more likely to be middle-aged or older, 
less educated, overweight or obese, and physically inactive and are more 
likely to have DM.
—
Those with the lowest rates are more likely to be younger but also 
overweight or obese.
—
Those with uncontrolled HBP who are not taking antihypertensive 
medication tend to be male, to be younger, and to have infrequent contact 
with a physician.
•
Analysis from the REGARDS study of the NINDS suggests that efforts to raise 
awareness of prevalent hypertension among blacks apparently have been successful 
(31% greater odds in blacks relative to whites), and efforts to communicate the 
importance of receiving treatment for hypertension have been successful (69% 
greater odds among blacks relative to whites); however, substantial racial 
disparities remain with regard to the control of BP (SBP <140 mm Hg, DBP <90 
mm Hg), with the odds of control being 27% lower in blacks than whites. In 
contrast, geographic disparities in hypertension awareness, treatment, and control 
were minimal.15
•
Data from the 2009 NHIS showed that black adults ≥18 years of age were more 
likely (32.2%) to have been told on ≥2 occasions that they had hypertension than 
American Indian/Alaska Native adults (21.8%), white adults (23.0%), and Asian 
adults (19.4%).16
•
The CDC analyzed death certificate data from 1995 to 2002 (any-mention 
mortality; ICD-9 codes 401 to 404 and ICD-10 codes I10 to I13). The results 
indicated that Puerto Rican Americans had a consistently higher hypertension-
related death rate than all other Hispanic subpopulations and non-Hispanic whites. 
The age-standardized hypertension-related mortality rate was 127.2 per 100 000 
population for all Hispanics, similar to that of non-Hispanic whites (135.9). The 
age-standardized rate for Hispanic females (118.3) was substantially lower than 
that observed for Hispanic males (135.9). Hypertension-related mortality rates for 
males were higher than rates for females for all Hispanic subpopulations. Puerto 
Rican Americans had the highest hypertension-related death rate among all 
Hispanic subpopulations (154.0); Cuban Americans had the lowest (82.5).17
•
Some studies suggest that Hispanic Americans have rates of HBP similar to or 
lower than those of non-Hispanic white Americans. Findings from a new analysis 
of combined data from the NHIS of 2000 to 2002 point to a health disparity 
between black and white adults of Hispanic descent. Black Hispanics were at 
slightly greater risk than white Hispanics, although non-Hispanic black adults had 
by far the highest rate of HBP. The racial disparity among Hispanics also was 
evident in the fact that higher-income, better-educated black Hispanics still had a

higher rate of HBP than lower-income, less-educated white Hispanics.18 Data from 
the NHLBI’s ARIC study found that hypertension was a particularly powerful risk 
factor for CHD in black people, especially black women.19
•
Data from MESA found that being born outside the United States, speaking a 
language other than English at home, and living fewer years in the United States 
were each associated with a decreased prevalence of hypertension.20
•
Filipino (27%) and Japanese (25%) adults were more likely than Chinese (17%) or 
Korean (17%) adults to have ever been told that they had hypertension.21
Mortality
HBP mortality in 2007 was 57 732. Any-mention mortality in 2007 was 336 353 (NHLBI 
tabulation of NCHS mortality data). The 2007 death rate was 17.8.22
•
From 1997 to 2007, the death rate caused by HBP increased 9.0%, and the actual 
number of deaths rose 35.6% (NCHS and NHLBI; appropriate comparability ratios 
were applied).
•
The 2007 overall death rate resulting from HBP was 17.8. Death rates were 15.7 for 
white males, 49.2 for black males, 14.3 for white females, and 37.0 for black 
females. When any-mention mortality for 2007 was used, the overall death rate was 
108.5. Death rates were 108.6 for white males, 228.8 for black males, 90.7 for 
white females, and 174.8 for black females (NHLBI tabulation of NCHS mortality 
data).
Risk Factors
•
Numerous risk factors and markers for development of hypertension, including age, 
ethnicity, family history of hypertension and genetic factors, lower education and 
socioeconomic status, greater weight, lower physical activity, tobacco use, 
psychosocial stressors, sleep apnea, and dietary factors (including dietary fats, 
higher sodium intake, lower potassium intake, and excessive alcohol intake), have 
been identified.
•
A study of related individuals in the NHLBI’s FHS estimated that when measured 
at a single examination, BP levels are ≈40% heritable; when measured across 
multiple examinations, long-term BP trends are ≈55% heritable.23
•
Recent data from the Nurses’ Health Study suggest that a large proportion of 
incident hypertension in women can be prevented by controlling dietary and 
lifestyle risk factors.24
Aftermath
•
Approximately 69% of people who have a first heart attack, 77% of those who have 
a first stroke, and 74% of those who have CHF have BP >140/90 mm Hg (NHLBI 
unpublished estimates from ARIC, CHS, and FHS Cohort and Offspring studies).

•
Data from FHS/NHLBI indicate that recent (within the past 10 years) and remote 
antecedent BP levels may be an important determinant of risk over and above the 
current BP level.25
•
Data from the FHS/NHLBI indicate that hypertension is associated with shorter 
overall life expectancy, shorter life expectancy free of CVD, and more years lived 
with CVD.26
—
Total life expectancy was 5.1 years longer for normotensive men and 4.9 
years longer for normotensive women than for hypertensives of the same 
sex at 50 years of age.
—
Compared with hypertensive men at 50 years of age, men with untreated 
BP <140/90 mm Hg survived on average 7.2 years longer without CVD 
and spent 2.1 fewer years of life with CVD. Similar results were observed 
for women.
Hospital Discharges/Ambulatory Care Visits
•
From 1997 to 2007, the number of inpatient discharges from short-stay hospitals 
with HBP as the first-listed diagnosis increased from 422 000 to 568 000 (NCHS, 
NHDS). The number of all-listed discharges increased from 6 629 000 to 10 645 
000 (NHLBI, unpublished data from the NHDS, 2007).
•
Data from ambulatory medical care utilization estimates for 2007 showed that the 
number of visits for essential hypertension was 46 284 000.27
•
In 2007, there were 349 000 hospitalizations with a first-listed diagnosis of 
essential hypertension (ICD-9-CM code 401), but essential hypertension was listed 
as either a primary or a secondary diagnosis 8 784 000 times for hospitalized 
inpatients (NHLBI, unpublished data from the NHDS, 2007).
Awareness, Treatment, and Control
•
Data from NHANES/NCHS 2005 to 2008 showed that of those with hypertension 
who were ≥20 years of age, 79.6% were aware of their condition, 70.9% were 
under current treatment, 47.8% had their hypertension under control, and 52.2% did 
not have it controlled (NHLBI tabulation, NCHS, NHANES data).
•
Data from NHANES 1999 to 2006 showed that 11.2% of adults ≥20 years of age 
had treated and controlled BP levels.28
•
Analysis of NHANES/NCHS data from 1999 to 2004 through 2005 to 2006 found 
that there were substantial increases in awareness and treatment rates of 
hypertension. The control rates increased in both sexes, in non-Hispanic blacks, 
and in Mexican Americans. Among the group ≥60 years of age, awareness, 
treatment, and control rates of hypertension increased significantly.5,29
•
In NHANES/NCHS 2005 to 2006, rates of control were lower in Mexican 
Americans (35.2%) than in non-Hispanic whites (46.1%) and non-Hispanic blacks 
(46.5%).5

•
The awareness, treatment, and control of HBP among those ≥65 years of age in the 
CHS/NHLBI improved during the 1990s. The percentages of those aware of and 
treated for HBP were higher among blacks than among whites. Prevalences with 
HBP under control were similar. For both groups combined, the control of BP to 
<140/90 mm Hg increased from 37% in 1990 to 49% in 1999. Improved control 
was achieved by an increase in antihypertensive medications per person and by an 
increase in the proportion of the CHS population treated for hypertension from 
34.5% to 51.1%.30
•
Data from the FHS of the NHLBI show that:
—
Among those ≥80 years of age, only 38% of men and 23% of women had 
BPs that met targets set forth in the National High Blood Pressure 
Education Program’s clinical guidelines. Control rates in men <60, 60 to 
79, and ≥80 years of age were 38%, 36%, and 38%, respectively; for 
women in the same age groups, they were 38%, 28%, and 23%, 
respectively.31
•
Data from the Women’s Health Initiative Observational Study of nearly 100 000 
postmenopausal women across the country enrolled between 1994 and 1998 
indicate that although prevalence rates ranged from 27% of women 50 to 59 years 
of age to 41% of women 60 to 69 years of age to 53% of women 70 to 79 years of 
age, treatment rates were similar across age groups: 64%, 65%, and 63%, 
respectively. Despite similar treatment rates, hypertension control is especially poor 
in older women, with only 29% of hypertensive women 70 to 79 years of age 
having clinic BPs <140/90 mm Hg compared with 41% and 37% of those 50 to 59 
and 60 to 69 years of age, respectively.32
•
A study of >300 women in Wisconsin showed a need for significant improvement 
in BP and LDL levels. Of the screened participants, 35% were not at BP goal, 
32.4% were not at LDL goal, and 53.5% were not at both goals.33
•
In 2005, a survey of people in 20 states conducted by the BRFSS of the CDC found 
that 19.4% of respondents had been told on 2 or more visits to a health professional 
that they had HBP. Of these, 70.9% reported changing their eating habits; 79.5% 
reduced the use of or were not using salt; 79.2% reduced the use of or eliminated 
alcohol; 68.8% were exercising; and 73.4% were taking antihypertensive 
medication.34
•
On the basis of NHANES 2003 to 2004 data, it was found that nearly three fourths 
of adults with CVD comorbidities have hypertension. Poor control rates of systolic 
hypertension remain a principal problem that further compromises their already 
high CVD risk.35
Cost
•
The estimated direct and indirect cost of HBP for 2007 is $43.5 billion (MEPS, 
NHLBI tabulation).

Prehypertension
•
Prehypertension is untreated SBP of 120 to 139 mm Hg or untreated DBP of 80 to 
89 mm Hg and not having been told on 2 occasions by a physician or other health 
professional that one has hypertension.
•
Data from NHANES 1999 to 2006 estimate 29.7% of adults ≥20 years of age have 
prehypertension.28
•
Follow-up of 9845 men and women in the FHS/NHLBI who attended examinations 
from 1978 to 1994 revealed that at 35 to 64 years of age, the 4-year incidence of 
hypertension was 5.3% for those with baseline BP <120/80 mm Hg, 17.6% for 
those with SBP of 120 to 129 mm Hg or DBP of 80 to 84 mm Hg, and 37.3% for 
those with SBP of 130 to 139 mm Hg or DBP of 85 to 89 mm Hg. At 65 to 94 
years of age, the 4-year incidences of hypertension were 16.0%, 25.5%, and 49.5% 
for these BP categories, respectively.36
•
Data from FHS/NHLBI also reveal that prehypertension is associated with elevated 
relative and absolute risks for CVD outcomes across the age spectrum. Compared 
with normal BP (<120/80 mm Hg), prehypertension was associated with a 1.5- to 
2-fold risk for major CVD events in those <60, 60 to 79, and ≥80 years of age. 
Absolute risks for major CVD associated with prehypertension increased markedly 
with age: 6-year event rates for major CVD were 1.5% in prehypertensive people 
<60 years of age, 4.9% in those 60 to 79 years of age, and 19.8% in those ≥80 years 
of age.31
•
In a study of NHANES 1999 to 2000 (NCHS), people with prehypertension were 
more likely than those with normal BP levels to have above-normal cholesterol 
levels, overweight/obesity, and DM, whereas the probability of currently smoking 
was lower. People with prehypertension were 1.65 times more likely to have 1 or 
more of these adverse risk factors than were those with normal BP.37

8. Congenital Cardiovascular Defects
ICD-9 745 to 747, ICD-10 Q20 to Q28. See Tables 8-1 through 8-4.
Congenital cardiovascular defects, also known as congenital heart defects, are structural 
problems that arise from abnormal formation of the heart or major blood vessels. ICD-9 lists 
25 congenital heart defects codes, of which 21 designate specified anatomic and/or 
hemodynamic lesions.
Defects range in severity from tiny pinholes between chambers, which are nearly irrelevant 
and often resolve spontaneously, to major malformations that can require multiple surgical 
procedures before school age and may result in death in utero, in infancy, or in childhood. 
The common complex defects include:
•
Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF; 9% to 14%)
•
Transposition of the great arteries (TGA; 10% to 11%)
•
Atrioventricular septal defects (4% to 10%)
•
Coarctation of the aorta (8% to 11%)
•
Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HPLHS; 4% to 8%)
•
Ventricular septal defects (VSDs)
Although VSDs may close spontaneously, these lesions are the most prevalent in childhood 
and still account for 14% to 16% of defects that require an invasive procedure within the 
first year of life.1 Atrial septal defects (ASDs) are the most common defects seen in adults.2
Prevalence
The estimated number of adults with congenital heart defects ranges from 650 000 to 1.3 
million.1,2 From 1940 to 2002, ≈2 million patients with congenital cardiovascular defects 
were born in the United States, ≈1 million with simple lesions and 0.5 million each with 
moderate and complex lesions. Using available data to estimate the prevalence of congenital 
cardiovascular defects at birth and in adults in the year 2000, the survival of these patients is 
estimated to be 2000 assuming no treatment (the low estimate) and full treatment (the high 
estimate). If all were treated, there would be 750 000 survivors with simple lesions, 400 000 
with moderate lesions, and 180 000 with complex lesions; in addition, there would be 3 
million subjects alive with bicuspid aortic valves. Without treatment, the number of 
survivors in each group would be 400 000, 220 000, and 30 000, respectively. The actual 
numbers surviving are projected to be between these 2 sets of estimates.2 The 32nd Bethesda

Conference estimated that the total number of adults living with congenital heart disease in 
the United States in 2000 was 787 800.3 In the United States, 1 in 150 adults is expected to 
have some form of congenital heart disease.4
Currently, no measured data are available in the United States for the prevalence of 
congenital cardiovascular defects in adults. Population data from Quebec, Canada, measured 
a prevalence of congenital cardiac defects of 11.89 per 1000 children and 4.09 per 1000 
adults.5 The most common types of defects in children are as follows: VSD, 620 000 people; 
ASD, 235 000 people; valvular pulmonary stenosis, 185 000 people; and patent ductus 
arteriosus, 173 000 people.2 The most common lesions seen in adults are ASD and TOF.3
Incidence
As of 2002, the most commonly reported incidence of congenital cardiovascular defects in 
the United States is between 4 and 10 per 1000, clustering around 8 per 1000 live births.6 
Major defects are usually apparent in the neonatal period, but minor defects may not be 
detected until adulthood. Thus, true measures of the incidence of congenital heart disease 
would need to record new cases of defects that present any time in fetal life through 
adulthood; however, estimates are available only for new cases detected between birth and 
30 days of life, known as birth prevalence, or for new cases detected in the first year of life 
only. Both of these are typically reported as cases per 1000 live births per year and do not 
distinguish between tiny defects that resolve without treatment and major malformations. To 
distinguish more serious defects, some studies also report new cases of sufficient severity to 
require an invasive procedure or that result in death within the first year of life. Despite the 
absence of a true incidence figure, some data are available and are provided in Table 8-1.
•
According to the CDC, 1 in every 110 infants in the metropolitan Atlanta, GA, area 
is born with a congenital heart defect, including some infants with tiny defects that 
resolve without treatment. Some defects occur more commonly in boys or girls or 
in whites or blacks.6
•
Eight (8.0) defects per 1000 live births, or 36 000 affected infants per year, are 
expected in the United States. Of these, several studies suggest that 9200, or 2.3 per 
1000 live births, require invasive treatment or result in death in the first year of 
life.1
•
Estimates also are available for bicuspid aortic valves, which occur in 13.7 per 
1000 people; these defects may not require treatment in infancy but can cause 
problems later in adulthood.7
•
Some studies suggest that as many as 5% of newborns, or 200 000 per year, are 
born with tiny muscular VSDs, almost all of which close spontaneously.8,9 These 
defects almost never require treatment, so they are not included in Table 8-1.
•
Data collected by the National Birth Defects Prevention Network from 11 states 
from 1999 to 2001 showed the average prevalence of 18 selected major birth 
defects. These data indicated that there are >6500 estimated annual cases of 5 
cardiovascular defects: truncus arteriosus, TGA, TOF, atrioventricular septal 
defect, and HPLHS.10

Risk Factors
•
Numerous intrinsic and extrinsic nongenetic risk factors contribute to CHD.11
•
Attributable risks or fractions have been shown to include paternal anesthesia in 
TOF (3.6%), sympathomimetic medication for coarctation of the aorta (5.8%), 
pesticides for VSD (5.5%), and solvents for HPLHS (4.6%).12
•
A study of infants born with heart defects unrelated to genetic syndromes who were 
included in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study found that women who 
reported smoking in the month before becoming pregnant or in the first trimester 
were more likely to give birth to a child with a septal defect. Compared with the 
infants of mothers who did not smoke during pregnancy, infants of mothers who 
were heavy smokers (≥25 cigarettes daily) were twice as likely to have a septal 
defect.13
•
Associations between exposure to air pollutants during first-trimester pregnancy 
and risks of congenital heart defects were documented from 1986 to 2003 by the 
Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program that related carbon monoxide, 
nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide measurements to the risk of ASD, VSD, TGA, 
and TOF.14
•
The results of a population-based study examining pregnancy obesity found a weak 
to moderate positive association of maternal obesity with 7 of 16 categories of birth 
defects.15
•
Although folic acid supplementation is recommended during pregnancy to 
potentially reduce the risk of congenital heart defects,11 there has been only 1 US 
population-based case-control study, performed with the Baltimore-Washington 
Infant Study between 1981 and 1989, that showed an inverse relationship between 
folic acid use and the risk of TGA.16 A study from Quebec that analyzed 1.3 
million births from 1990 to 2005 found a significant 6%/y reduction in severe 
congenital heart defects using a time-trend analysis before and after public health 
measures were instituted that mandated folic acid fortification of grain and flour 
products in Canada.17
•
Pregestational DM was significantly associated with cardiac defects, both isolated 
and multiple. Gestational DM was associated with a limited group of birth 
defects.18
Mortality
Congenital cardiovascular defects mortality in 2007 was 3547. Any-mention mortality 
related to congenital cardiovascular defects in 2007 was 5643.
•
Congenital cardiovascular defects are the most common cause of infant death 
resulting from birth defects; >24% of infants who die of a birth defect have a heart 
defect.19
•
The 2007 death rate for congenital cardiovascular defects was 1.2. Death rates were 
1.3 for white males, 1.5 for black males, 1.0 for white females, and 1.4 for black

females. Crude infant mortality rates (<1 year of age) were 35.5 for white infants 
and 51.7 for black infants.20
•
In 2007, 189 000 life-years were lost before 55 years of age because of deaths 
resulting from congenital cardiovascular defects. This is almost as many as the life-
years lost from leukemia and asthma combined (NHLBI tabulation of NCHS 
mortality data).
•
The mortality rate attributable to congenital defects has been declining. From 1979 
to 1997, age-adjusted death rates resulting from all defects declined 39%, and 
deaths tended to occur at progressively older ages. Nevertheless, 45% of deaths still 
occurred in infants <1 year of age. The mortality rate varies considerably according 
to type of defect.21
•
From 1997 to 2007, death rates for congenital cardiovascular defects declined 
33.3%, whereas the actual number of deaths declined 23.8%.19
•
Data from the Pediatric Heart Network conducted in 15 North American centers 
revealed that even in lesions associated with the highest mortality among 
congenital lesions such as HPLHS, aggressive palliation can lead to 12-month 
survival from 64% to 74%.22
•
Data analysis from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons, a voluntary registry with self-
reported data for a 4-year cycle (2004 to 2007) from 68 centers performing 
congenital heart surgery (67 from the United States and 1 from Canada), showed 
that of 61 410 total operations, the overall aggregate hospital discharge mortality 
rate was 3.7%; specifically, for neonates (0 to 30 days of age), the mortality rate 
was 10.7%; for infants (31 days to 1 year of age), it was 2.6%; for children (>1 year 
to 18 years of age), it was 1.2%; and for adults (>18 years of age), it was 1.9%.23
•
Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample 1988 to 2003, mortality was examined for 
12 congenital heart defects procedures. A total of 30 250 operations were 
identified, which yielded a national estimate of 152 277±7875 operations. Of these, 
27% were performed in patients ≥18 years of age. The overall in-hospital mortality 
rate for adult patients with congenital heart defects was 4.71% (95% CI, 4.19 to 
5.23), with a significant reduction in mortality observed when surgery was 
performed on adult patients with congenital heart defects by pediatric versus 
nonpediatric heart surgeons (1.87% versus 4.84%; P<0.0001).24
Hospitalizations
In 2004, birth defects accounted for >139 000 hospitalizations, representing 47.4 stays per 
100 000 people. Cardiac and circulatory congenital anomalies, which include ASDs and 
VSDs, accounted for more than one third of all hospital stays for birth defects and had the 
highest in-hospital mortality rate. Between 1997 and 2004, hospitalization rates increased by 
28.5% for cardiac and circulatory congenital anomalies. For almost 86 300 hospitalizations, 
ASD was noted as the principal reason for the hospital stay or as a coexisting or secondary 
condition.25

Cost
•
From 2003 data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project 2003 Kids’ 
Inpatient Database (KID) and information on birth defects in the Congenital 
Malformations Surveillance Report, it was found that the most expensive average 
neonatal hospital charges were for 2 congenital heart defects: HPLHS ($199 597) 
and common truncus arteriosus ($192 781). Two other cardiac defects, coarctation 
of the aorta and TGA, were associated with average hospital charges in excess of 
$150 000. For the 11 selected cardiovascular congenital defects (of 35 birth defects 
considered), there were 11 578 hospitalizations in 2003 and 1550 in-hospital deaths 
(13.4%). Estimated total hospital charges for these 11 conditions were $1.4 
billion.26
•
In 2004, hospital costs for congenital cardiovascular defect conditions totaled $2.6 
billion. The highest aggregate costs were for stays related to cardiac and circulatory 
congenital anomalies, which accounted for ≈$1.4 billion, more than half of all 
hospital costs for birth defects.25

Cardiomyopathy
ICD-9 425; ICD-10 I42.
Mortality—24 703. Any-mention mortality—48 579. Hospital discharges—55 000.
•
Mortality from cardiomyopathy is highest in older people, men, and blacks.
•
Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy develops slowly and appears reversible, but 
recurrent tachycardia causes rapid decline in left ventricular function and 
development of HF. Sudden death is possible.1
•
Since 1996, the NHLBI-sponsored Pediatric Cardiomyopathy Registry has 
collected data on all children with newly diagnosed cardiomyopathy in New 
England and the Central Southwest (Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas).2
—
The overall incidence of cardiomyopathy is 1.13 cases per 100 000 in 
children <18 years of age.

—
In children <1 year of age, the incidence is 8.34, and in children 1 to 18 
years of age, it is 0.70 per 100 000.
—
The annual incidence is lower in white than in black children, higher in 
boys than in girls, and higher in New England (1.44 per 100 000) than in 
the Central Southwest (0.98 per 100 000).
•
Studies show that 36% of young athletes who die suddenly have probable or 
definite hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.3
•
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in 
young people, including trained athletes. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most 
common inherited heart defect, occurring in 1 of 500 individuals. In the United 
States, ≈500 000 people have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, yet most are unaware 
of it.4
•
In a recent report of the Pediatric Cardiomyopathy Registry, the overall annual 
incidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in children was 4.7 per 1 million 
children. There was a higher incidence in the New England than in the Central 
Southwest region, in boys than in girls, and in children diagnosed at <1 year of age 
than in older children.5
•
Dilated cardiomyopathy is the most common form of cardiomyopathy. The 
Pediatric Cardiomyopathy Registry recently reported an annual incidence of dilated 
cardiomyopathy in children <18 years of age of 0.57 per 100 000 per year overall. 
The annual incidence was higher in boys than in girls (0.66 versus 0.47 cases per 
100 000), in blacks than in whites (0.98 versus 0.46 cases per 100 000), and in 
infants (<1 year of age) than in children (4.40 versus 0.34 cases per 100 000). The 
majority of children (66%) had idiopathic disease. The most common known 
causes were myocarditis (46%) and neuromuscular disease (26%).6
Heart Failure
ICD-9 428, ICD-10 I50.
Incidence
•
Data from the NHLBI-sponsored FHS7 indicate that:
—
HF incidence approaches 10 per 1000 population after 65 years of age.
—
Seventy-five percent of HF cases have antecedent hypertension.
—
At 40 years of age, the lifetime risk of developing HF for both men and 
women is 1 in 5. At 80 years of age, remaining lifetime risk for 
development of new HF remains at 20% for men and women, even in the 
face of a much shorter life expectancy.
—
At 40 years of age, the lifetime risk of HF occurring without antecedent 
MI is 1 in 9 for men and 1 in 6 for women.

—
The lifetime risk for people with BP >160/90 mm Hg is double that of 
those with BP <140/90 mm Hg.
•
The annual rates per 1000 population of new HF events for white men are 15.2 for 
those 65 to 74 years of age, 31.7 for those 75 to 84 years of age, and 65.2 for those 
≥85 years of age. For white women in the same age groups, the rates are 8.2, 19.8, 
and 45.6, respectively. For black men, the rates are 16.9, 25.5, and 50.6,* and for 
black women, the estimated rates are 14.2, 25.5, and 44.0,* respectively (CHS, 
NHLBI).8
•
In MESA, African Americans had the highest risk of developing HF, followed by 
Hispanic, white, and Chinese Americans (4.6, 3.5, 2.4, and 1.0 per 1000 person-
years, respectively). This higher risk reflected differences in the prevalence of 
hypertension, DM, and socioeconomic status. African Americans had the highest 
proportion of incident HF not preceded by clinical myocardial infarction (75%).9
•
In Olmsted County, MN, the incidence of HF did not decline between 1979 and 
2000.10
•
In the ARIC study of the NHLBI, the age-adjusted incidence rate per 1000 person-
years was 3.4 for white women, less than all other groups—that is, white men (6.0), 
black women (8.1), and black men (9.1). The 30-day, 1-year, and 5-year case 
fatality rates after hospitalization for HF were 10.4%, 22%, and 42.3%, 
respectively. Blacks had a greater 5-year case fatality rate than whites (P<0.05). HF 
incidence rates in black women were more similar to those of men than of white 
women. The greater HF incidence in blacks than in whites is explained largely by 
blacks’ greater levels of atherosclerotic risk factors.11
•
Data from Kaiser Permanente indicated an increase in the incidence of HF among 
the elderly, with the effect being greater in men.12
•
Data from hospitals in Worcester, MA, indicate that during 2000, the incidence and 
attack rates for HF were 219 per 100 000 and 897 per 100 000, respectively. HF 
was more frequent in women and the elderly. The hospital fatality rate was 5.1%.13
•
In the CARDIA study, HF before 50 years of age is more common among blacks 
than whites. Hypertension, obesity, and systolic dysfunction are important risk 
factors that may be targets for prevention.14
Risk Factors
•
In the NHLBI-sponsored FHS, hypertension is a common risk factor for HF 
followed closely by antecedent MI.15
•
In a study of 2763 postmenopausal women with coronary disease, DM was the 
strongest risk factor for HF.16
•
The prevalence of DM is increasing among older people with HF. Between 1979 
and 1999, among subjects in Olmsted County, MN, with a first diagnosis of HF, the 
prevalence of DM increased 3.8% every year. The odds of having DM for those

first diagnosed with HF in 1999 were nearly 4 times higher than for those 
diagnosed 20 years earlier.17
•
In the Framingham Offspring Study, among 2739 participants, increased circulating 
concentrations of resistin were associated with incident HF, independently of 
prevalent coronary disease, obesity, insulin resistance, and inflammation.18
•
Among 20 900 male physicians in the Physicians Health Study, the lifetime risk of 
HF at 40 years of age was 13.8%. Lifetime risk of HF was higher in men with 
hypertension; healthy lifestyle factors (normal weight, not smoking, regular 
exercise, moderate alcohol intake, consumption of breakfast cereals, and 
consumption of fruits and vegetables) were related to lower risk of HF.19
•
Among 2934 participants in the Health Aging, Body and Composition (ABC) 
study, the incidence of HF was 13.6 per 1000 person-years. Men and black 
participants were more likely to develop HF. Coronary disease (population-
attributable risk [PAR], 23.9% for white participants, 29.5% for black participants) 
and uncontrolled BP (PAR, 21.3% for white participants, 30.1% for black 
participants) had the highest PARs in both races. There was a higher overall 
proportion of HF attributable to modifiable risk factors in black participants versus 
white participants (67.8% versus 48.9%). Hospitalizations were higher among 
black participants.20
Left Ventricular Function
•
Data from Olmsted County, MN, indicate that:
—
Among asymptomatic individuals, the prevalence of left ventricular 
diastolic dysfunction was 21% for mild diastolic dysfunction and 7% for 
moderate or severe diastolic dysfunction. The prevalence of systolic 
dysfunction was 6%. The presence of any left ventricular dysfunction 
(systolic or diastolic) was associated with an increased risk of developing 
overt HF, and diastolic dysfunction was predictive of all-cause death.21
—
Among individuals with symptomatic HF, the prevalence of left 
ventricular diastolic dysfunction was 6% for mild diastolic dysfunction 
and 75% for moderate or severe diastolic dysfunction.22 The proportion 
of people with HF and preserved ejection fraction (EF) increased over 
time. Survival improved over time among individuals with reduced EF 
but not among those with preserved EF.23
Mortality
•
In 2007, HF any-mention mortality was 277 193 (121 684 males and 155 509 
females). HF was mentioned on 277 193 US death certificates and was the 
underlying cause in 56 565 of those deaths in 2007 (NCHS, NHLBI). Table 9-1 
contains the numbers of these deaths that are coded for HF as the underlying cause.

•
The 2007 overall any-mention death rate for HF was 85.4. Any-mention death rates 
were 99.2 for white males, 104.2 for black males, 76.7 for white females, and 82.5 
for black females (NCHS, NHLBI).
•
One in 9 deaths has HF mentioned on the death certificate (NCHS, NHLBI).
•
The number of any-mention deaths from HF was about as high in 1995 (287 000) 
as it was in 2006 (283 000) (NCHS, NHLBI).
•
Survival after HF diagnosis has improved over time as shown by data from the 
FHS24 and Olmsted County Study.10 However, the death rate remains high: ≈50% 
of people diagnosed with HF will die within 5 years.10,24
•
In the elderly, data from Kaiser Permanente indicate that survival after the onset of 
HF also improved.12
Hospital Discharges/Ambulatory Care Visits
•
Hospital discharges for HF were essentially unchanged from 1997 to 2007 with 
first listed discharges of 966 000 and 990 000, respectively (unpublished data from 
the NHDS 2007, NCHS, NHLBI).
•
Data from Ambulatory Medical Care Utilization Estimates for 2007 showed that 
the number of visits for HF was 3 434 000.25
•
Among 1077 patients with HF in Olmsted County, MN, hospitalizations were 
common after HF diagnosis, with 83% patients hospitalized at least once and 43% 
hospitalized at least 4 times. More than one half of hospitalizations were related to 
noncardiovascular causes.26

Mortality and any-mention mortality in this section are for 2007. “Mortality” is the number 
of deaths in 2007 for the given underlying cause. Prevalence data are for 2006. Hospital 
discharge data are from the NHDS/NCHS; data include inpatients discharged alive, dead, or 
status unknown. Hospital discharge data for 2007 are based on ICD-9 codes.
Valvular Heart Disease
ICD-9 424; ICD-10 I34 to I38.
Mortality—23 313. Any-mention mortality—44 149. Hospital discharges—98 000.
•
Echocardiographic data from the CARDIA Study (n=4351), the ARIC Study 
(n=2435), and the CHS (n=5125) were pooled to assess the prevalence of valve 
disease. The prevalence increased with age, from 0.7% (95% CI 0.5% to 1.0%) in 
participants 18 to 44 years of age to 13.3% (95% CI 11.7% to 15.0%) in 
participants ≥75 years of age (P<0.0001). The prevalence of valve disease, adjusted 
to the US 2000 population, was 2.5% (95% CI 2.2% to 2.7%). The adjusted 
mortality risk ratio associated with valve disease was 1.36 (95% CI 1.15 to 1.62; 
P=0.0005).1
•
Doppler echocardiography data in 1696 men and 1893 women (54±10 years of age) 
attending a routine examination at the Framingham Study were used to assess the 
prevalence of valvular regurgitation. Mitral regurgitation and tricuspid 
regurgitation of more than or equal to mild severity were seen in 19.0% and 14.8% 
of men and 19.1% and 18.4% of women, respectively. Aortic regurgitation of more 
than or equal to trace severity was present in 13.0% of men and 8.5% of women.2
Aortic Valve Disorders
ICD-9 424.1; ICD-10 I35.
Mortality—15 183. Any-mention mortality—28 191. Hospital discharges—48 000.
•
Calcific aortic stenosis on a trileaflet valve or bicuspid aortic valve is the most 
common cause of aortic stenosis.3

•
In the MESA, a study of 5880 participants 45 to 84 years of age, aortic valve 
calcium was quantified with serial CT images. During a mean follow-up of 2.4 
years, 210 subjects (4.1%) had a mean incidence rate of progression of 1.7% per 
year, which increased significantly with age. The incident aortic valve calcium risk 
was associated with several traditional cardiovascular risk factors, specifically age, 
male sex, BMI, and smoking.4
•
In the Euro Heart Survey, which included 4910 patients in more than 25 countries, 
aortic stenosis was the most frequent lesion, accounting for 43% of all patients who 
had valvular heart disease.5
•
Among men and women ≥65 years of age enrolled in the CHS who underwent 
echocardiography, the aortic valve was normal in 70% of cases, sclerotic without 
outflow obstruction in 29%, and stenotic in 2%. Aortic sclerosis was associated 
with an increase of ≈50% in the risk of death due to cardiovascular causes and the 
risk of MI.6 Clinical factors associated with aortic sclerosis and stenosis were 
similar to risk factors for atherosclerosis.7 These data largely exclude patients with 
congenital heart disease, a group that is expected to increasingly contribute to the 
prevalence of valve disease.
Mitral Valve Disorders
ICD-9 424.0; ICD-10 I34.
Mortality—2644. Any-mention mortality—5608. Hospital discharges—42 000.
Prevalence
•
In pooled data from the CARDIA, ARIC, and CHS studies, mitral valve disease 
was the most common valvular lesion. At least moderate mitral regurgitation 
occurred at a frequency of 1.7% as adjusted to the US adult population of 2000, 
increasing from 0.5% to 9.3% between 18 and ≥75 years of age.1
•
Isolated mitral stenosis is more common in women and occurs in 40% of all 
patients presenting with rheumatic HD.8
•
The NHLBI-sponsored FHS reports that among people 26 to 84 years of age, the 
prevalence of mitral valve disorders is ≈1% to 2% and equal between women and 
men.9
•
The prevalence of mitral valve prolapse in the general population was evaluated 
with the use of echocardiograms of 1845 women and 1646 men who participated in 
the fifth examination of the Offspring Cohort of the FHS. The prevalence of mitral 
valve prolapse was 2.4%. The frequencies of chest pain, dyspnea, and 
electrocardiographic abnormalities were similar among subjects with prolapse and 
those without prolapse.9

The incidence of acute rheumatic fever has decreased in the United States.10
•
Although localized outbreaks have occurred, the overall incidence of acute 
rheumatic fever remains very low in most areas of the United States.11,12
•
The incidence of rheumatic fever remains high in blacks, Puerto Ricans, Mexican 
Americans, and American Indians.13
•
In 1950, ≈15 000 Americans (adjusted for changes in ICD codes) died of 
rheumatic fever/rheumatic HD compared with ≈3300 today (NCHS/NHLBI).
•
From 1996 to 2006, the death rate for rheumatic fever/rheumatic HD fell 8.3%, and 
actual deaths declined 26.2% (NCHS/NHLBI).
•
The 2006 overall death rate for rheumatic fever/rheumatic HD was 1.1. Death rates 
were 0.8 for white males, 0.7 for black males, 1.3 for white females, and 0.9 for 
black females (NCHS/NHLBI).
•
Immune risk factors have been linked with rheumatic HD. Human leukocyte 
antigen (HLA) typing was performed in 120 black patients with severe chronic 
rheumatic HD requiring cardiac surgery; the HLA-DR 1 antigen was present in 
12.6% of patients compared with 2.7% of normal control subjects, and the HLA-
DRw6 antigen was present in 31.1% of patients compared with 15% of control 
subjects, which suggests that genetically determined immune response factors may 
play a role in the pathogenesis of severe chronic rheumatic HD.14

The 2007 AHA Guidelines on Prevention of Infective Endocarditis15 state that 
infective endocarditis (IE) is thought to result from the following sequence of 
events: (1) Formation of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis on the surface of a 
cardiac valve or elsewhere that endothelial damage occurs; (2) bacteremia; and (3) 
adherence of the bacteria in the bloodstream to nonbacterial thrombotic 
endocarditis and proliferation of bacteria within a vegetation. Viridans group 
streptococci are part of the normal skin, oral, respiratory, and gastrointestinal tract 
flora, and they cause ≥50% of cases of community-acquired nativevalve IE not 
associated with intravenous drug use.16

•
Transient bacteremia is common with manipulation of the teeth and periodontal 
tissues, and reported frequencies of bacteremia because of dental procedures vary 
widely: Tooth extraction, 10% to 100%; periodontal surgery, 36% to 88%; scaling 
and root planing, 8% to 80%; teeth cleaning, up to 40%; rubber dam matrix/wedge 
placement, 9% to 32%; and endodontic procedures, up to 20%. Transient 
bacteremia also occurs frequently during routine daily activities unrelated to dental 
procedures: Tooth brushing and flossing, 20% to 68%; use of wooden toothpicks, 
20% to 40%; use of water-irrigation devices, 7% to 50%; and chewing food, 7% to 
51%. When it is considered that the average person living in the United States has 
<2 dental visits per year, the frequency of bacteremia from routine daily activities 
is far greater than that associated with dental procedures.1
•
Although the absolute risk for IE from a dental procedure is impossible to measure 
precisely, the best available estimates are as follows: If dental treatment causes 1% 
of all cases of viridans group streptococcal IE annually in the United States, the 
overall risk in the general population is estimated to be as low as 1 case of IE per 
14 million dental procedures. The estimated absolute risk rates for IE from a dental 
procedure in patients with underlying cardiac conditions are as follows15:
—
Mitral valve prolapse: 1 per 1.1 million procedures
—
CHD: 1 per 475 000
—
Rheumatic HD: 1 per 142 000
—
Presence of a prosthetic cardiac valve: 1 per 114 000
—
Previous IE: 1 per 95 000 dental procedures
•
Although these calculations of risk are estimates, it is likely that the number of 
cases of IE that result from a dental procedure is exceedingly small. Therefore, the 
number of cases that could be prevented by antibiotic prophylaxis, even if 
prophylaxis were 100% effective, is similarly small. One would not expect 
antibiotic prophylaxis to be near 100% effective, however, because of the nature of 
the organisms and choice of antibiotics.15

•
An estimated 4248 hospitalizations for KD occurred in the United States in 2000, 
with a median patient age of 2 years. Race-specific incidence rates indicate that KD 
is most common among Americans of Asian and Pacific Island descent (32.5 per 
100 000 children <5 years of age), occurs with intermediate frequency in non-
Hispanic blacks (16.9 per 100 000 children <5 years of age) and Hispanics (11.1 
per 100 000 children <5 years of age), and is least common in whites (9.1 per 100 
000 children <5 years of age).18 In the United States, KD is more common during 
the winter and early spring months; boys with KD outnumber girls by ≈1.5:1 to 
1.7:1; and 76% of children with KD are <5 years of age.19
Venous Thromboembolism Epidemiology (Including Deep Vein Thrombosis and 
Pulmonary Embolism)20
Pulmonary Embolism—ICD-9 415.1; ICD-10 I26.
Mortality—7097. Any-mention mortality—27 824. Hospital discharges—146 000.
Deep Vein Thrombosis—ICD-9 451.1; ICD-10 I80.2.
Mortality—2381. Any-mention mortality—12 018.
Incidence
•
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) consists of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which 
typically involves deep veins of the leg or pelvis, and its complication, pulmonary 
embolism (PE).
•
The average incidence of VTE among whites is 108 per 100 000 person-years, with 
≈250 000 incident cases occurring annually among US whites.
•
VTE incidence appears to be similar or higher among African Americans and lower 
among Asian Americans and Native Americans.
•
With adjustment for the different age and sex distributions of African Americans, 
VTE incidence is ≈78 per 100 000, which suggests 27 000 incident VTE cases 
occur annually among US African Americans.
•
Modeling suggests that more than 900 000 incident or recurrent VTE events occur 
annually in the United States, of which approximately one third are fatal.
•
VTE incidence has not changed significantly over the last 25 years.
•
Incidence rates increase exponentially with age for both males and females for both 
DVT and PE.
•
Incidence rates are higher in women during childbearing years, whereas incidence 
rates after age 45 years are higher in men.
•
PE accounts for an increasing proportion of VTE with increasing age for both 
sexes.

Survival
•
Observed survival after VTE is significantly worse than expected survival for age 
and sex, and survival after PE is much worse than after DVT alone.
•
For almost one quarter of patients with PE, the initial clinical presentation is 
sudden death.
•
Thirty-day VTE survival is 74.8% (DVT alone, 96.2%; PE with or without DVT, 
59.1%).21
•
PE is an independent predictor of reduced survival for up to 3 months.
•
Because most PE deaths are sudden and are usually attributed to underlying disease 
(eg, cancer; other chronic heart, lung, or renal disease), secular trends in VTE 
survival are confounded by autopsy rates.
Recurrence
•
VTE is a chronic disease with episodic recurrence; ≈30% of patients develop 
recurrence within the next 10 years.
•
The hazard of recurrence varies with the time since the incident event and is 
highest within the first 6 to 12 months.
•
Independent predictors of recurrence include increasing patient age and BMI; 
neurological disease with leg paresis; active cancer; lupus anticoagulant or 
antiphospholipid antibody, antithrombin, protein C, or protein S deficiency; and 
persistently increased plasma fibrin D-dimer.
Complications
•
VTE complications include venous stasis syndrome (VSS) (or postthrombotic 
syndrome), venous ulcer, and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension 
(CTEPH).
•
The 20-year cumulative VSS and venous ulcer incidence after proximal DVT is 
≈40% and 3.7%, respectively.
•
CTEPH incidence is 6.5 per million person-years; ≈1400 incident CTEPH cases 
occur annually among US whites.
Risk Factors
•
Independent VTE risk factors include increasing patient age, surgery, trauma/
fracture, hospital or nursing home confinement, active cancer, central vein 
catheterization or transvenous pacemaker, prior superficial vein thrombosis, 
varicose veins, and neurological disease with leg paresis, and among women, oral 
contraceptive use, pregnancy/ postpartum status, and hormone therapy.
•
Together, these risk factors account for >75% of all incident VTE that occurs in the 
community.

•
Compared with residents in the community, hospitalized residents have a >130-fold 
higher incidence of VTE (71 versus 9605 cases per 100 000 person-years).22
•
Hospitalization and nursing home residence together account for almost 60% of 
incident VTE events that occur in the community.
•
Pregnancy-associated VTE incidence is 200 per 100 000 woman-years; compared 
with nonpregnant women of childbearing age, the RR is increased ≈4-fold.
•
VTE risk during the postpartum period is ≈5-fold higher than during pregnancy.
•
VTE is highly heritable and follows a complex mode of inheritance that involves 
environmental interaction.
•
Inherited thrombophilias (eg, inherited antithrombin, protein C, or protein S 
deficiency; factor V Leiden; prothrombin G20210A; ABO blood type non-O) 
interact with such clinical risk factors (ie, environmental “exposures”) as oral 
contraceptives, pregnancy, hormone therapy, and surgery to compound VTE risk.
•
Similarly, genetic interaction compounds the risk of incident and recurrent VTE.
Peripheral Arterial Disease
•
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) affects ≈8 million Americans and is associated 
with significant morbidity and mortality.23 Prevalence increases dramatically with 
age, and PAD disproportionately affects blacks.23
•
PAD affects 12% to 20% of Americans ≥65 years of age.24 Despite its prevalence 
and cardiovascular risk implications, only ≈70% to 80% of patients with PAD 
undergo recommended antiplatelet therapy or lipid-lowering therapy.25
•
In the general population, only ≈10% of people with PAD have the classic 
symptom of intermittent claudication. Approximately 40% do not complain of leg 
pain, whereas the remaining 50% have a variety of leg symptoms different from 
classic claudication.26,27 In an older, disabled population of women, however, as 
many as two thirds of individuals with PAD had no exertional leg symptoms.28
•
The risk factors for PAD are similar but not identical to those for CHD. DM and 
cigarette smoking are stronger risk factors for PAD than for CHD.29 ORs for 
associations of DM and smoking with symptomatic PAD are ≈3.0 to 4.0. Most 
studies suggest that the prevalence of PAD is similar in men and women.30
•
Pooled data from 11 studies in 6 countries found that PAD is a marker for systemic 
atherosclerotic disease. The ageand sex-adjusted RR of all-cause death was 2.35; 
for CVD mortality, it was 3.34; and for CHD fatal and nonfatal events combined, it 
was 2.13. The findings for stroke were slightly weaker but still significant, with a 
pooled RR of 1.86 for fatal and nonfatal events combined.31
•
A recent meta-analysis of 24 955 men and 23 339 women demonstrated that the 
association of the ankle brachial index (ABI) with mortality has a reverse J-shaped 
distribution in which participants with an ABI of 1.11 to 1.40 are at lowest risk for 
mortality.32 Furthermore, an ABI <0.90 added meaningfully to the Framingham

Risk Score in predicting 10-year risk of total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, 
and major coronary events. An ABI <0.90 approximately doubled the risk of total 
mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and major coronary events in each Framingham 
Risk Score category.32
•
Among 508 patients (449 men) identified from 2 vascular laboratories in San 
Diego, CA, a decline in ABI of >0.15 within a 10-year period was associated with a 
subsequent increased risk of all-cause mortality (RR 2.4) and CVD mortality (RR 
of 2.8) at 3 years’ follow-up.33
•
Among 440 patients with PAD, male sex and smoking were more associated with 
aortoiliac (proximal) disease than infrailiac (distal) disease. In addition, aortoiliac 
disease was associated with an increased risk of mortality or cardiovascular events 
compared with infrailiac disease (adjusted HR 3.28, 95% CI 1.87 to 5.75).34
•
Men and women with PAD have higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers than 
individuals without PAD. Elevated levels of C-reactive protein were associated 
with an increased risk of developing PAD among men in the Physicians’ Health 
Study.35 The OR for developing PAD 5 years after C-reactive protein measurement 
was 2.1 for those in the highest versus lowest baseline quartile of C-reactive 
protein. Among participants in the Women’s Health Study, 12 years after soluble 
intercellular adhesion molecule-1 measurement, women in the highest baseline 
tertile for levels of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 had a 2-fold increased 
risk of developing PAD compared with women in the lowest baseline tertile.36 
Among individuals with PAD, higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers are 
associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality rates and increased 
risk of failure of lower-extremity revascularization procedures.37–39
•
Data from the NHANES 1999 to 2004 cohort demonstrated an inverse association 
between bilirubin levels and prevalence of PAD. A 0.1-mg/dL higher level of 
bilirubin was associated with a 6% reduction in the odds of PAD (OR 0.94, 95% CI 
0.90 to 0.98) after adjustment for PAD risk factors.40
•
People with PAD have impaired function and quality of life. This is true even for 
people who do not report leg symptoms. Furthermore, patients with PAD, including 
those who are asymptomatic, experience a significant decline in lower-extremity 
functioning over time.41–43
•
Data from NHANES 1999 to 2000 (NCHS) show that high blood levels of lead and 
cadmium are associated with an increased prevalence of PAD. Exposure to these 2 
metals can occur through cigarette smoke. The risk was 2.8 for high levels of 
cadmium and 2.9 for high levels of lead. The OR of PAD for current smokers was 
4.13 compared with people who had never smoked.44
•
Results from NHANES 1999 to 2000 (NCHS) and the CHS showed a remarkably 
high prevalence of PAD among patients with renal insufficiency.45,46 In addition, 
chronic kidney disease is common among community-dwelling older men and 
women with a high ABI.46

•
Available evidence suggests that the prevalence of PAD in people of Hispanic 
origin is similar to or slightly higher than that in non-Hispanic whites.23,47
•
Among patients with established PAD, higher physical activity levels during daily 
life are associated with better overall survival rate, a lower risk of death because of 
CVD, and slower rates of functional decline.48,49 In addition, better 6-minute walk 
performance and faster walking speed are associated with lower rates of all-cause 
mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and mobility loss.50,51
•
A cross-sectional, population-based telephone survey of >2500 adults ≥50 years of 
age, with oversampling of blacks and Hispanics, found that 26% expressed 
familiarity with PAD. Of these, half were not aware that diabetes mellitus and 
smoking increase the risk of PAD. One in 4 knew that PAD is associated with 
increased risk of heart attack and stroke, and only 14% were aware that PAD could 
lead to amputation. All knowledge domains were lower in individuals with lower 
income and education levels.52

Participants in the NHLBI-sponsored FHS study were followed up from 1968 to 
1999. At 40 years of age, remaining lifetime risks for AF were 26.0% for men and 
23.0% for women. At 80 years of age, lifetime risks for AF were 22.7% for men 
and 21.6% for women. In further analysis, counting only those who had 
development of AF without prior or concurrent HF or MI, lifetime risk for AF was 
≈16%.56
•
Data from a large community-based population suggest that AF is less prevalent in 
blacks than in whites, both overall and in the setting of congestive heart 
failure.54,57

Data from the NHDS/NCHS (1996 –2001) on cases that included AF as a primary 
discharge diagnosis found the following58:
—
Approximately 44.8% of patients were men.
—
The mean age for men was 66.8 years versus 74.6 years for women.

—
From 1996 to 2001, hospitalizations with AF as the first-listed diagnosis 
increased by 34%.
•
In 1999, the CDC analyzed data from national and state multiple-cause mortality 
statistics and Medicare hospital claims for people with AF. The most common 
disease listed as the primary diagnosis for people hospitalized with AF was HF 
(11.8%), followed by AF (10.9%), CHD (9.9%), and stroke (4.9%).59 In Olmsted 
County, MN, the age-adjusted incidence of clinically recognized AF in a white 
population increased by 12.6% between 1980 and 2000.60,61
—
The incidence of AF was greater in men (incidence ratio for men over 
women 1.86) and increased markedly with older age.60
—
If incidence estimates are applied to US population projections from the 
Census Bureau, the projected number of people with AF may exceed 12 
million by 2050.60
—
Among Medicare patients ≥65 years of age, AF prevalence increased 
from 3.2% in 1992 to 6.0% in 2002, with higher prevalence in older 
subsets of the study population. Stroke rates per 1000 patient-years 
declined in AF patients on anticoagulants from 46.7 in 1992 to 19.5 in 
2002 for ischemic stroke but remained fairly steady for hemorrhagic 
stroke (1.6 to 2.9).62
—
AF independently increases the risk of ischemic stroke by 4- to 5-fold.63
—
AF is responsible for at least 15% to 20% of all ischemic strokes.55
—
Paroxysmal, persistent, and permanent AF all appear to increase the risk 
of ischemic stroke to a similar degree.64
—
AF is also an independent risk factor for ischemic stroke severity and 
recurrence. In 1 study, people who had AF and were not treated with 
anticoagulants had a 2.1-fold increase in risk for recurrent stroke and a 
2.4-fold increase in risk for recurrent severe stroke.65
—
Isolated chronic atrial flutter is uncommon but is associated with a high 
risk of developing AF,66 and data from a sample of 191 patients with 
chronic atrial flutter revealed a risk of ischemic stroke that was similar to 
that for AF.67

Atherosclerosis is a process that leads to a group of diseases characterized by a thickening of 
artery walls. Atherosclerosis causes many deaths due to heart attack and stroke and accounts 
for nearly three fourths of all deaths because of CVD (FHS, NHLBI).
Analysis of data from the Reduction of Atherothrombosis for Continued Health (REACH) 
Registry74 showed that atherothrombosis (CAD, CVD, and PAD) is associated with the 
main causes of death on a worldwide scale. Despite decreases in age-adjusted death rates, 
the absolute number of deaths attributable to these conditions continues to increase, and 
prevalence is increasing sharply in other parts of the world. Atherothrombotic diseases are 
projected to be the leading cause of death worldwide in 2020. In the REACH study, 
outpatients with established atherosclerotic arterial disease or at risk of atherothrombosis 
experienced relatively high annual cardiovascular event rates. Multiple disease locations 
increased the 1-year risk of cardiovascular events.75
Other Diseases of Arteries—ICD-9 442 to 448; ICD-10 I72 to I78.
Mortality—8954. Any-mention mortality—30 727. Hospital discharges—90 000.

11. Family History and Genetics
Prevalence
Family History of HD
•
Among adults ≥20 years of age, 13.3% reported a parent or sibling with a heart 
attack or angina before the age of 50 years (NHANES question MCQ300a, 
combined for 2005 to 2008). The racial/ethnic breakdown is as follows:
—
For non-Hispanic whites, 14.9% for men, 16.7% for women
—
For non-Hispanic blacks, 10.0% for men, 12.4% for women
—
For Mexican Americans, 8.8% for men, 12.3% for women

For other races, 11.4% for men, 13.6% for women
•
HD occurs as people age, and those without a family history of HD may survive 
longer, so the prevalence of family history will vary depending on the age at which 
it is assessed. The breakdown of reported family history of heart attack by age in 
the US population, as measured by NHANES, is as follows:
—
Age 20 to 39 years, 10.3% for men, 11.6% for women
—
Age 40 to 59 years, 14.1% for men, 18.4% for women
—
Age 60 to 79 years, 12.4% for men, 15.5% for women
—
Age ≥80 years, 11.2% for men, 9.2% for women
•
In the multigenerational FHS, only 75% of participants with a documented parental 
history of a heart attack before 55 years of age reported that history when asked.1
Impact of Family History
•
Premature parental history of a heart attack has been shown to approximately 
double the risk of a heart attack in men and to increase the risk in women by 
≈70%.2,3
•
Sibling history of a HD has been shown to increase the odds of HD in men and 
women by ≈50%.4
Genetics
•
The increased risk of HD seen in people with a family history of a heart attack is 
likely due in part to shared genetics. The full genetic basis for CVD has not yet 
been determined, and genetic markers discovered thus far have not been shown to 
add to existing cardiovascular risk prediction tools.5
•
The most consistently replicated genetic marker for HD is located at 9p21.3. At this 
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), ≈27% of the white population is estimated 
to have 0 risk alleles, 50% is estimated to have 1 risk allele, and the remaining 23% 
is estimated to have 2 risk alleles.6
—
The 10-year HD risk for a 65-year-old man with 2 alleles and no other 
traditional risk factors is ≈13.2%, whereas a similar man with 0 alleles 
would have a 10-year risk of ≈9.2%. The 10-year HD risk for a 40-year-
old woman with 2 alleles and no other traditional risk factors is ≈2.4%, 
whereas a similar man with 0 alleles would have a 10-year risk of 
≈1.7%.6
—
The biological function of the 9p21.3 SNP is not yet known.

See Table 12-1 and Charts 12-1 and 12-2.
Prevalence
Youth
•
In 2009, in grades 9 through 12, 19.5% of students reported current cigarette use 
(on at least 1 day during the 30 days before the survey), 14.0% of students reported 
current cigar use, and 8.9% of students reported current smokeless tobacco use. 
Overall, 26.0% of students reported any current tobacco use (YRBSS).1
•
In 2009, in grades 9 to 12, male and female students were equally likely to report 
current cigarette use (19.8% compared with 19.1%); however, male students were 
more likely than female students to report current cigar use (18.6% compared with 
8.8%) and current smokeless tobacco use (15.0% compared with 2.2%; YRBSS).1
•
In 2009, in grades 9 through 12, non-Hispanic white students were more likely than 
Hispanic or non-Hispanic black students to report any current tobacco use, which 
includes cigarettes, cigars, or smokeless tobacco (30.3% compared with 20.8% for 
Hispanic students and 16.2% for non-Hispanic black students; YRBSS).1

•
Among youths 12 to 17 years of age in 2008, 2.8 million (11.4%) used a tobacco 
product (cigarettes, cigars, or smokeless tobacco) in the past month, and 2.3 million 
(9.1%) used cigarettes, a decrease compared with 2007. Cigarette use in the past 
month in the age group declined from 13.0% in 2002 to 9.1% in 2008 (National 
Survey on Drug Use and Health [NSDUH]).2,3
•
Data from the YRBSS4 for students in grades 9 to 12 indicated the following:
—
The percentage of students who reported ever trying cigarettes remained 
stable from 1991 to 1999 and then declined from 70.4% in 1999 to 46.3% 
in 2009.
—
The percentage who reported current cigarette use (on at least 1 day in the 
30 days before the survey) increased between 1991 and 1997 and then 
declined from 36.4% in 1997 to 19.5% in 2009.
—
The percentage who reported current frequent cigarette use (smoked on 
≥20 of the 30 days before the survey) increased from 1991 to 1999 and 
then declined from 16.8% in 1999 to 7.3% in 2009.
•
In 2007, 60.9% of students in grades 9 to 12 who ever smoked cigarettes daily tried 
to quit smoking cigarettes. The prevalence of this behavior did not vary by grade 
but was higher among female students (67.3%) than male students (55.5%) and 
higher among black students (68.1%) than Hispanic students (54.1%). No other 
differences were found by race/ethnicity. Overall, 12.2% of students who ever 
smoked cigarettes daily tried to quit smoking cigarettes and were successful 
(YRBSS).5
Adults
•
From 1998 to 2009, the percentage of US adults ≥18 years of age who were current 
cigarette smokers declined from 24.1% to 20.6%; however, the percentage who 
were current smokers did not change significantly from 2005 to 2009 (NHIS).6,7
•
In 2009, among Americans ≥18 years of age, 23.1% of men and 18.1% of women 
were current cigarette smokers, putting them at increased risk of heart attack and 
stroke (NHIS).8
•
From 1998 to 2007, cigarette smoking prevalence among adults ≥18 years of age 
decreased in 44 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Six states had no 
substantial changes in prevalence after controlling for age, sex, and race/ethnicity. 
However, only Utah and the US Virgin Islands met the Healthy People 2010 target 
for reducing adult smoking prevalence to 12% (BRFSS).9
•
In 2009, among adults ≥18 years of age, the state with the highest percentage of 
current cigarette smokers was West Virginia (25.5%), and the state with the lowest 
percentage was Utah (9.8%; BRFSS).10
•
In 2006 to 2008, Asian adults ≥18 years of age (men 15.7%, women 4.5%) and 
Hispanic adults (men 18.4%, women 9.4%) were less likely to be current cigarette 
smokers than American Indian or Alaska Native adults (men 30.2%, women

22.1%), non-Hispanic white adults (men 24.0%, women 21.0%), and non-Hispanic 
black adults (men 25.0%, women 17.1%), on the basis of age-adjusted estimates 
(NHIS).11
•
In 2004 to 2006 data, adult cigarette smoking varied among Asian subgroups. Most 
Asian adults had never smoked, with rates ranging from 65% of Korean adults to 
84% of Chinese adults. Korean adults (22%) were ≈2 to 3 times as likely to be 
current smokers as Japanese (12%), Asian Indian (7%), or Chinese (7%) adults on 
the basis of age-adjusted estimates (NHIS).12
•
In 2008, among people ≥65 years of age, 9.8% of men and 8.5% of women were 
current smokers. In this age group, men were more likely than women to be former 
smokers (54.3% compared with 28.9%) on the basis of age-adjusted estimates 
(NHIS).13
•
Among women 15 to 44 years of age, combined data for 2007 and 2008 indicated 
that the rate of past-month cigarette use was lower among those who were pregnant 
(16.4%) than among those who were not pregnant (27.3%). This pattern was 
evident among women 18 to 25 years of age (22.1% versus 32.3% for pregnant and 
nonpregnant women, respectively) and among women 26 to 44 years of age (12.6% 
versus 27.4%, respectively). Among those 15 to 17 years of age, the difference in 
the rate of cigarette smoking between pregnant and nonpregnant women was not 
statistically significant (NSDUH).2
•
In 2008, an estimated 70.9 million Americans ≥12 years of age were current (past 
month) users of a tobacco product (cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco, or 
tobacco in pipes). The rate of current use of any tobacco product in this age range 
remained steady from 2007 to 2008 (28.6% and 28.4%, respectively; NSDUH).2
Incidence
•
In 2008, ≈2.4 million people ≥12 years of age smoked cigarettes for the first time 
within the past 12 months, which was similar to the estimate in 2007 (2.2 million). 
The 2008 estimate averages out to ≈6600 new cigarette smokers every day. Most 
new smokers (58.8%) in 2008 were <18 years of age when they first smoked 
cigarettes (NSDUH).2
•
Data from 2002 to 2004 suggest that ≈1 in 5 nonsmokers 12 to 17 years of age is 
likely to start smoking. Youths in the Mexican subpopulations were significantly 
more susceptible (28.8%) to start smoking than those in non- Hispanic white 
(20.8%), non-Hispanic black (23.0%), Cuban (16.4%), Asian Indian (15.4%), 
Chinese (15.3%), and Vietnamese (13.8%) subpopulations. There was no 
significant difference in susceptibility to start smoking between boys and girls in 
any of the major populations or subpopulations (NSDUH).14
•
Approximately 80% of people who use tobacco began at <18 years of age, 
according to a report from the Surgeon General of the United States. The most 
common age of initiation is 14 to 15 years.15

Mortality
•
During 2000 to 2004, cigarette smoking resulted in an estimated 443 000 premature 
deaths each year due to smoking-related illnesses, and ≈49 000 of these deaths 
were due to secondhand smoke (SHS). In adults ≥35 years of age, a total of 32.7% 
of these deaths were related to CVD.16
•
Each year from 2000 to 2004, smoking caused 3.1 million years of potential life 
lost for males and 2.0 million years for females, excluding deaths due to smoking-
attributable residential fires and adult deaths due to SHS.16
•
From 2000 to 2004, smoking during pregnancy resulted in an estimated 776 infant 
deaths annually.16
•
During 2000 to 2004, cigarette smoking resulted in an estimated 269 655 deaths 
annually among males and 173 940 deaths annually among females.16
•
On average, male smokers die 13.2 years earlier than male nonsmokers, and female 
smokers die 14.5 years earlier than female nonsmokers.17
•
Current cigarette smoking is a powerful independent predictor of cardiac arrest in 
patients with CHD.18
•
After up to 14.5 years of follow-up of participants in the Lung Health Study of the 
NHLBI, the all-cause death rate among participants in a smoking-cessation 
intervention was significantly lower (15%) than among those given usual care.19
Secondhand Smoke
•
The national prevalence of households with smoke-free home rules increased from 
43.2% during 1992 to 1993 to 72.2% in 2003 on the basis of data from the 
“Tobacco Use Supplement” to the “Current Population Survey.” During this 
period, the prevalence of such rules increased from 9.6% to 31.8% among 
households with at least 1 smoker and from 56.8% to 83.5% among households 
with no smokers. Approximately 126 million children and nonsmoking adults were 
still exposed to SHS in the United States as of 1999 to 2002.20
•
In 2008, data from 11 states showed that the majority of people surveyed in each 
state reported having smoke-free home rules, ranging from 68.8% in West Virginia 
to 85.6% in Arizona (BRFSS).21
•
The percentage of the US nonsmoking population with detectable serum cotinine 
declined from 52.5% in 1999 to 2000 to 40.1% in 2007 to 2008, with declines 
occurring for children and adults. During 2007 to 2008, the percentage of 
nonsmokers with detectable serum cotinine was higher for those 3 to 11 years of 
age (53.6%) and those 12 to 19 years of age (46.5%) than for those ≤20 years of 
age (36.7%); the percentage was also higher for non-Hispanic blacks (55.9%) than 
for non-Hispanic whites (40.1%) and Mexican Americans (28.5%; NHANES).22
•
Data from a 2006 report of the US Surgeon General on the consequences of 
involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke23 indicate the following:

—
Nonsmokers who are exposed to SHS at home or at work increase their 
risk of developing CHD by 25% to 30%.
—
Short exposures to SHS can cause blood platelets to become stickier, 
damage the lining of blood vessels, and decrease coronary flow velocity 
reserves, potentially increasing the risk of an acute MI.
Aftermath
•
Among ever-smokers who had 1 circulatory disorder, 52.1% were current smokers, 
and among those who reported that they had ≥3 circulatory disorders, 28% were 
current smokers at the time of the interview. The adjusted odds of being a current 
smoker were lower for individuals who had ≥2 central circulatory disorders, such 
as MI, HF, or stroke, than for those without a central circulatory disorder.24
•
The CDC’s “Health Effects of Cigarette Smoking” fact sheet25 provides the 
following information:
—
Cigarette smokers are 2 to 4 times more likely to develop CHD than 
nonsmokers.
—
Cigarette smoking approximately doubles a person’s risk for stroke.
—
Cigarette smokers are >10 times as likely as nonsmokers to develop 
peripheral vascular disease.
—
Smoking increases the risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm.
•
In 2006, 62.9% of adult current smokers 18 to 64 years of age with a checkup 
during the preceding year reported that they had been advised to quit, about the 
same percentage as in 2002 (63.5%; MEPS).26
Cost
Direct medical costs ($96 billion) and lost productivity costs ($97 billion) associated with 
smoking totaled an estimated $193 billion per year between 2000 and 2004.16

•
The prevalence of abnormal lipid levels among youths 12 to 19 years of age is 
20.3%; 14.2% of normal-weight youths, 22.3% of overweight youths, and 42.9% of 
obese youths have at least 1 abnormal lipid level (NHANES 1999–2006, NCHS).1
•
Approximately 8.5% of adolescents 12 to 19 years of age have total cholesterol 
levels ≥200 mg/dL (NHANES 2005–2008, NCHS and NHLBI; unpublished 
analysis).
•
Fewer than 1% of adolescents are eligible for pharmacological treatment.1,2
Adults
•
An estimated 33 500 000 adults ≥20 years of age have total serum cholesterol 
levels ≥240 mg/dL (extrapolated to 2008 by use of NCHS/NHANES 2005–2008 
data), with a prevalence of 16.2% (Table 13-1; NCHS and NHLBI, unpublished

•
Data from NHANES 1999–2006 showed that ≈8% of adults ≥20 years of age have 
undiagnosed hypercholesterolemia.3
•
Data from the BRFSS study of the CDC in 2009 showed that the percentage of 
adults who had been screened for high blood cholesterol in the preceding 5 years 
ranged from 67.5% in Utah to 85.3% in the District of Columbia. The median 
percentage among all 50 states was 77.0%.4
•
The percentage of adults who reported having had a cholesterol check increased 
from 68.6% during 1999–2000 to 74.8% during 2005–2006.5
•
A10% (population-wide) decrease in total cholesterol levels may result in an 
estimated 30% reduction in the incidence of CHD.6
•
Data from NHANES 1999–2002 (NCHS) showed that overall, 63.3% of 
participants whose test results indicated high blood cholesterol or who were taking 
a cholesterol-lowering medication had been told by a professional that they had 
high cholesterol. Women were less likely than men to be aware of their condition; 
blacks and Mexican Americans were less likely to be aware of their condition than 
were whites. Fewer than half of Mexican Americans with high cholesterol were 
aware of their condition.7
•
Between the periods 1988–1994 and 1999–2002 (NHANES/NCHS), the age-
adjusted mean total serum cholesterol level of adults ≥20 years of age decreased 
from 206 to 203 mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol levels decreased from 129 to 123 
mg/dL.8
•
Data from NHANES 2003–2006 (NCHS) showed the serum total crude mean 
cholesterol level in adults ≥20 years of age was 198 mg/dL for men and 202 mg/dL 
for women.9
•
Data from the Minnesota Heart Survey (1980–1982 to 2000– 2002) showed a 
decline in age-adjusted mean total cholesterol concentrations from 5.49 and 5.38 
mmol/L for men and women, respectively, in 1980–1982 to 5.16 and 5.09 mmol/L, 
respectively, in 2000–2002; however, the decline was not uniform across all age 
groups. Middle-aged to older people have shown substantial decreases, but younger 
people have shown little overall change and recently had increased total cholesterol 
values. Lipid-lowering drug use rose significantly for both sexes among those 35 to 
74 years of age. Awareness, treatment, and control of hypercholesterolemia have 
increased; however, more than half of those at borderline-high risk remain unaware 
of their condition.10
•
Data from the BRFSS (CDC) survey in 2009 showed that among adults screened 
for high blood cholesterol, the percentage who had been told that they had high 
blood cholesterol ranged from 32.9% in Tennessee to 41.8% in South Carolina. The 
median percentage among states was 37.5%.4
•
Among adults with hypercholesterolemia, the percentage who had been told that 
they had high cholesterol increased from 42.0% during 1999–2000 to 50.4% during 
2005–2006.5

•
According to data from NHANES 2005–2006, between the periods 1999–2000 and 
2005–2006, mean serum total cholesterol levels in adults ≥20 years of age declined 
from 204 to 199 mg/dL. This decline was observed for men ≥40 years of age and 
for women ≥60 years of age. There was little change over this time period for other 
sex/age groups. In 2005–2006, ≈65% of men and 70% of women had been 
screened for high cholesterol in the past 5 years, and 16% of adults had serum total 
cholesterol levels of 240 mg/dL or higher.11
•
Self-reported use of cholesterol-lowering medications increased from 8.2% during 
1999–2000 to 14.0% during 2005–2006.5
•
According to data from NHANES, from 1999 to 2006, the prevalence of elevated 
LDL cholesterol levels in adults >20 years of age has decreased by ≈33%.12
Adherence
Youth—Analysis of data from NHANES 1999–2006 showed that the overall prevalence of 
abnormal lipid levels among youths 12 to 19 years of age was 20.3%.1
Adults
•
On the basis of data from the Third Report of the Expert Panel on Detection, 
Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults13:
—
Fewer than half of all people who qualify for any kind of lipid-modifying 
treatment for CHD risk reduction are receiving it.
—
Fewer than half of even the highest-risk people (those with symptomatic 
CHD) are receiving lipid-lowering treatment.
—
Only about one third of treated patients are achieving their LDL goal; 
<20% of patients with CHD are at their LDL goal.
•
Data from NHANES 2005–2006 indicate that among those with elevated LDL 
cholesterol levels, 35.5% had not been screened previously, 24.9% were screened 
but not told they had elevated cholesterol, and 39.6% were treated inadequately.12
Lipid Levels
LDL (Bad) Cholesterol
Youth
•
Among adolescents 12 to 19 years of age, the mean LDL cholesterol level is 88.5 
mg/dL. For boys, it is 87.1 mg/dL, and for girls, it is 89.9 mg/dL. The racial/ethnic 
breakdown is as follows (NHANES 2005–2008, NCHS and NHLBI; unpublished 
analysis):
—
Among non-Hispanic whites, 87.6 mg/dL for boys and 89.8 mg/dL for 
girls
—
Among non-Hispanic blacks, 88.8 mg/dL for boys and 92.6 mg/dL for 
girls

female adolescents during 1999–2006.1
Adults
•
The mean level of LDL cholesterol for American adults ≥20 years of age was 115.2 
mg/dL in 2008.12 Levels of 130 to 159 mg/dL are considered borderline high, 
levels of 160 to 189 mg/dL are classified as high, and levels of ≥190 mg/dL are 
considered very high.
•
According to NHANES 2005–2008 (NCHS and NHLBI; unpublished data):
—
Among non-Hispanic whites, mean LDL cholesterol levels were 114.5 
mg/dL for men and 115.8 mg/dL for women.
—
Among non-Hispanic blacks, mean LDL cholesterol levels were 114.6 
mg/dL for men and 111.5 mg/dL for women.
—
Among Mexican Americans, mean LDL cholesterol levels were 121.2 
mg/dL for men and 113.6 mg/dL for women.
•
The age-adjusted prevalence of high LDL cholesterol in US adults was 26.6% in 
1988–1994 and 25.3% in 1999–2004 (NHANES/NCHS). Between 1988–1994 and 
1999–2004, awareness increased from 39.2% to 63.0%, and use of pharmacological 
lipid-lowering treatment increased from 11.7% to 40.8%. LDL cholesterol control 
increased from 4.0% to 25.1% among those with high LDL cholesterol. In 1999–
2004, rates of LDL cholesterol control were lower among adults 20 to 49 years of 
age than among those ≥65 years of age (13.9% versus 30.3%, respectively), among 
non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans than among non-Hispanic whites 
(17.2% and 16.5% versus 26.9%, respectively), and among men than among 
women (22.6% versus 26.9%, respectively).14
•
Mean levels of LDL cholesterol decreased from 126.1 mg/dL during 1999–2000 to 
114.8 mg/dL during 2005–2006. The prevalence of high LDL cholesterol decreased 
from 31.5% during 1999–2000 to 21.2% during 2005–2006.12

See Table 14-1 and Charts 14-1 through 14-4.
Prevalence
Youth
Inactivity
•
The proportion of adolescents (12 to 19 years old) who report engaging in no 
regular PA is high and varies by sex and race.1
•
Nationwide, 23.1% of adolescents were inactive during the previous 7 days, 
indicated by their response that they did not participate in ≥60 minutes of any kind 
of PA that increased their heart rate and made them breathe hard on any 1 of the 
previous 7 days.1
•
Girls were more likely than boys to report inactivity (29.9% versus 17.0%).1
•
The prevalence of inactivity was highest in black (43.6%) and Hispanic (30.5%) 
girls, followed by white girls (25.4%), black boys (20.6%), Hispanic boys (17.4%), 
and white boys (15.9%; CDC).1
•
Nationwide, 24.9% of adolescents used a computer for activities other than school 
work (eg, videogames or other computer games) for ≥3 hours per day on an 
average school day.1
•
A greater proportion of black and Hispanic students used computers or watched 
television >3 hours per day than white students.2
Activity Recommendations
•
The proportion of students who met activity recommendations declined from 9th 
(39.7%) to 12th (31.6%) grades, and at each grade level, the proportion was higher 
in boys than in girls.1
•
More adolescent boys (45.6%) than girls (27.7%) self-reported having been 
physically active at least 60 minutes per day on 5 or more days; self-reported rates 
of activity were higher in white (39.9%) than in black (32.6%) or Hispanic (33.1%) 
adolescents.1
•
There was a marked discrepancy between the proportion of youth (ages 6 to 11 
years) who reported engaging in ≥60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical 
activity (MVPA) on most days of the week and those who actually engaged in 
MVPA for ≥60 minutes when activity was measured objectively with

accelerometers (ie, portable motion censors that record and quantify the duration 
and intensity of movements) in the NHANES 2003–2004 survey.3
•
On the basis of accelerometer counts per minute >2020, 42% of 6- to 11-year-olds 
accumulated ≥60 minutes of MVPA on 5 of 7 days per week, whereas only 8% of 
12- to 15-year-olds and 7.6% of 16- to 19-year-olds achieved similar counts.3
•
More boys than girls met PA recommendations (≥60 minutes of moderate to 
vigorous activity on most days of the week) as measured by accelerometry.3
•
Fewer than 50% of adolescents (14 to 17 years of age) met PA guideline 
recommendations; 57% of boys met recommendations versus 40% of girls.4
Structured Activity Participation
•
Despite recommendations from the National Association for Sport and Physical 
Education that schools should require daily physical education for students in 
kindergarten through 12th grade, only 33.3% of students attended physical 
education classes in school daily (34.6% of boys and 31.9% of girls).1,5
•
Physical education class participation declined from the 9th through the 12th grades 
among boys and girls.2
•
Among children 9 to 13 years old, 61.5% do not participate in any organized PA 
during nonschool hours and 22.6% do not engage in any free-time PA, according to 
2002 data from the Youth Media Campaign Longitudinal Study of the CDC.6
•
Little more than half (58.3%) of all students played on at least 1 school or 
community sports team in the previous year; however, the prevalence declined with 
increasing grade level, from 61.6% in the 9th grade to 51.1% in the 12th grade.1
Adults
Inactivity
•
Thirty-three percent of adults (>18 years of age) do not engage in leisure-time PA 
according to 2009 data from the NHIS (“no leisure-time physical activity/
inactivity” refers to no sessions of light/moderate or vigorous PA of at least 10 
minutes’ duration).7
•
Inactivity in 2009 was higher among women than men (34.5% versus 30.3%, age 
adjusted) and increased with age from 27.7% to 33.3%, 38.2%, and 55.3% among 
adults 18 to 44, 45 to 64, 65 to 74, and ≥75 years of age, respectively.7
•
Non-Hispanic black and Hispanic adults were more likely to report inactivity 
(0.8.7% and 44.0%, respectively) than were non-Hispanic white adults (28.4%), 
based on age-adjusted estimates from the 2009 NHIS.7
•
Fifty-six percent of adults who responded to the 2009 NHIS survey reported 
engaging in no vigorous activity (activity that causes heavy sweating and a large 
increase in breathing or heart rate).7

•
Women (60.1%) were more likely than men (50.3%) to report never engaging in 
vigorous PA, based on age-adjusted estimates from the 2009 NHIS.7
•
The proportion of respondents who did not participate in any vigorous activity 
increased with age from 45.7% in 18- to 44-year-olds to 86.8% in adults ≥75 years 
of age in the 2009 NHIS.7
•
American Indians/Alaska Natives (61.7%), blacks (61.6%), and Asians (61.4%) 
were more likely to report not engaging in any vigorous activity than whites 
(54.1%), and Hispanic/Latino adults were more likely not to engage in any 
vigorous activity (66.9%) than non-Hispanic/non-Latino adults (53.3%) according 
to age-adjusted estimates from the 2009 NHIS.7
•
The probability of not engaging in any vigorous activity was inversely associated 
with education; participants with no high school diploma (77.6%), a high school 
diploma (66.2%), some college (54.0%), or bachelor’s degree or higher (39.3%), 
respectively, reported that they did not engage in any vigorous PA, based on the 
2009 NHIS.7
Activity Recommendations
•
The proportion of adults reporting levels of PA consistent with the Healthy People 
2010 objectives remains low and decreases with age.8
•
Thirty-three percent of respondents in a study examining awareness of current US 
PA guidelines had direct knowledge of the recommended dosage of PA (ie, 
frequency/duration).9
•
The age-adjusted proportion of adults 18 years and older who reported engaging in 
regular moderate or vigorous PA as defined by the Healthy People 2010 objective 
22-2 was 32%, based on the 2008 NHIS (CDC, Data2010; available at http://
wonder.cdc.gov/data2010/).
•
The percentage of adults reporting regular moderate or vigorous PA decreased with 
age from 38% for adults 18 to 24 years of age to 18% for those ≥75 years, based on 
the 2008 NHIS (CDC, Data2010; available at http://wonder.cdc.gov/data2010/).
•
In 2008, 27% of adults participated in leisure-time strengthening activities, an 
important component of overall physical fitness.
—
The percentage of men who engaged in leisure-time strengthening 
activities decreased with age, from 47% at age 18 to 24 years to 16% at 
age ≥75 years. The percentage of women who engaged in leisure-time 
strengthening activities also decreased with age, from 28% at age 18 to 24 
years to 11% at age ≥75 years.10
•
The proportion of adults reporting regular leisure-time activity (30 minutes of light 
or moderate activity ≥5 times per week or 20 minutes of vigorous activity ≥3 times 
per week) in the 2009 NHIS was positively associated with education level: 46.0% 
of people with a college degree or higher were regularly active compared with 
21.4% of adults with less than a high school diploma.7

•
Adherence to PA recommendations was much lower when based on PA measured 
by accelerometer in NHANES 2003–20043:
—
Among adults 20 to 59 years of age, 3.8% of men and 3.2% of women 
met recommendations to engage in MVPA (accelerometer counts >2020/
min) for 30 minutes (in sessions of ≥10 minutes) on ≥5 of 7 days.
—
Among people ≥60 years of age, adherence was 2.5% in men and 2.3% in 
women.
•
In a review examining self-reported versus actual measured PA (eg, 
accelerometers, pedometers, indirect calorimetry, double-labeled water, heart rate 
monitor), 60% of respondents self-reported higher values of activity than what was 
measured by use of direct methods.
—
Among men, self-reported PA was 44% greater than actual measured 
values; among women, self-reported activity was 138% greater than 
actual measured PA.11
Trends
Youth
•
A study of 3068 youths between the ages of 14 and 24 years from 1999 to 2006 
found that the prevalence of inactivity went up with age in both boys and girls.
—
Across ages, girls had a higher prevalence of physical inactivity than 
boys.12
—
In a study of 12 812 youth ages 9 to 18 years, the PA level in boys and 
girls declines starting at the age of 13, with a significantly greater decline 
in activity among girls.13
Adults
•
Between NHANES III (1988 –1994) and NHANES 2001–2006, the proportion of 
adults who engaged in >12 bouts of PA per month declined from 57% to 43% in 
men and from 49% to 43% in women.
•
In non-Hispanic whites, the activity level has decreased from 55.3% to 45.2%; for 
non-Hispanic blacks, it has decreased from 41.2% to 34.6%; and for Hispanics, the 
decline has been from 40.9% to 36.2%.14
CHD Risk Factors
Youth
•
More girls (67.9%) than boys (55.7%) reported having exercised to lose weight or 
to keep from gaining weight.
•
White girls (72.2%) were more likely than black (54.2%) and Hispanic (66.3%) 
girls to report exercising to lose weight or to keep from gaining weight.1

•
Total and vigorous PA are inversely correlated with body fat and the prevalence of 
obesity.15
•
Physical inactivity was positively correlated with CHD risk factors (eg, mean 
arterial pressure, triglycerides, LDL, HDL, and fasting plasma glucose) in youths. 
Findings were similar for boys and girls.16
Adults
•
Participants in the Diabetes Prevention Project randomized trial who met the PA 
goal of 150 minutes of PA per week were 44% less likely to develop DM, even if 
they did not meet the weight-loss target.17
•
As a weight-loss intervention, exercise alone was associated with significant 
reductions in DBP (−2 mm Hg, 95% CI −4 to −1 mm Hg), triglycerides (−0.2 
mmol/L, 95% CI −0.3 to −0.1 mmol/L), and fasting glucose (−0.2 mmol/L, 95% CI 
−0.3 to −0.1 mmol/L).18
•
A total of 120 to 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity activity can reduce 
the risk of developing metabolic syndrome and its individual components (ie, 
abdominal adiposity, high BP, low HDL cholesterol, high triglycerides, or high 
glucose).19
CHD Events and Mortality
•
The PA guidelines for adults cite evidence that ≈150 minutes a week of moderate-
intensity aerobic activity can reduce the risk of CVD.20
—
The RR of CHD associated with physical inactivity ranges from 1.5 to 
2.4.21
—
Physical inactivity is responsible for 12.2% of the global burden of MI 
after accounting for other CVD risk factors such as cigarette smoking, 
DM, hypertension, abdominal obesity, lipid profile, no alcohol intake, 
and psychosocial factors.22
—
A 2.3% decline in physical inactivity between 1980 and 2000 prevented 
or postponed ≈17 445 deaths (≈5%) due to CHD in the United States.23
—
The Nurse’s Health Study of >72 000 female nurses indicated that 
moderate-intensity PA, such as walking, is associated with a substantial 
reduction in risk of total and ischemic stroke.24
•
Longitudinal studies commonly report a graded, inverse association of PA amount 
and duration (ie, dose) with incident CHD and stroke.25
—
In the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, PA “dose” was inversely 
associated with the incidence of CHD over time, with rates declining 
from 46.3, 39.3, 35.9, 32.2, and 25.8 cases per 10 000 person years 
according to quintiles of activity. The adjusted HR comparing the 
uppermost quintile of activity with the lowest was 0.72 (95% CI 0.61 to 
0.85).26

—
Metabolic equivalent tasks (MET) levels >6 were associated with a 
statistically significantly lower RR (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.97 versus 
MET intensity of 1 to 3.9) of developing incident CHD in the Health 
Professionals Follow-Up Study of men.26
—
In a meta-analysis of longitudinal studies among women, RRs of incident 
CHD were 0.83 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.99), 0.77 (95% CI 0.64 to 0.92), 0.72 
(95% CI 0.59 to 0.87), and 0.57 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.79) across increasing 
quintiles of PA compared with the lowest quintile.27
—
A 2003 meta-analysis of 23 studies on the association of PA with stroke 
indicated that compared with low levels of activity, high (RR 0.79, 95% 
CI 0.69 to 0.91) and moderate (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.05) levels of 
activity were inversely associated with the likelihood of developing total 
stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic).28
Secondary Prevention
•
PA improves inflammatory markers in people with existing stable CHD. After a 6-
week training session, C-reactive protein levels declined by 23.7% (P<0.001), and 
plasma vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 levels declined by 10.23% (P<0.05); 
there was no difference in leukocyte count or levels of intercellular adhesion 
molecule-1.29
•
In a randomized trial of patients with PAD, supervised treadmill exercise training 
and lower-extremity resistance training were each associated with significant 
improvements in functional performance and quality of life compared with a usual-
care control group. Exercise training was additionally associated with improved 
brachial artery flow-mediated dilation, whereas resistance training was associated 
with better stair-climbing ability versus control.30
•
The benefit of intense exercise training for cardiac rehabilitation in people with HF 
was tested in a trial of 27 patients with stable, medically treated HF. Intense 
activity (an aerobic interval-training program 3 times per week for 12 weeks) was 
associated with a significant 35% improvement in left ventricular EF and decreases 
in pro– brain natriuretic peptide (40%), left ventricular end-diastolic volume (18%), 
and left ventricular end-systolic volume (25%) compared with control and 
endurance-training groups.31
Costs
•
The economic consequences of physical inactivity are substantial. In a summary of 
WHO data sources, the economic costs of physical inactivity were estimated to 
account for 1.5% to 3.0% of total direct healthcare expenditures in developed 
countries such as the United States.32
•
The 1996 MEPS was linked to self-reported activity in the 1995 NHIS. On the 
basis of a self-reported prevalence of inactivity of 47.5% and a prevalence of CVD

Prevalence
Youth
•
The prevalence of overweight and obesity in children 2 to 5 years of age, based on 
a BMI-for-age value ≥85th percentile of the 2000 CDC growth charts, was 16% for 
non-Hispanic white boys and 20% for non-Hispanic white girls, 28% for non-
Hispanic black boys and 24% for non-Hispanic black girls, and 32% for Mexican 
American boys and 23% for Mexican American girls according to 2007 to 2008 
data from NHANES (NCHS). In children 6 to 11 years of age, the prevalence was 
35% for non-Hispanic white boys and 34% for non-Hispanic white girls, 36% for 
non-Hispanic black boys and 39% for non-Hispanic black girls, and 44% for 
Mexican American boys and 39% for Mexican American girls. In children 12 to 19 
years of age, the prevalence was 33% for non-Hispanic white boys and 30% for 
non-Hispanic white girls, 33% for non-Hispanic black boys and 46% for non-
Hispanic black girls, and 46% for Mexican American boys and 42% for Mexican 
American girls.1
•
The prevalence of obesity in children 2 to 5 years of age, based on BMI-for-age 
values ≥95th percentile of the 2000 CDC growth charts, was 7% for non-Hispanic 
white boys and 12% for non-Hispanic white girls, 11% for non-Hispanic black 
boys and 12% for non-Hispanic black girls, and 19% for Mexican American boys 
and 8% for Mexican American girls according to 2007 to 2008 data from NHANES 
(NCHS). In children 6 to 11 years of age, the prevalence was 21% for non-Hispanic 
white boys and 17% for non-Hispanic white girls, 18% for non-Hispanic black 
boys and 21% for non-Hispanic black girls, and 27% for Mexican American boys 
and 22% for Mexican American girls. In children 12 to 19 years of age, the 
prevalence was 17% for non-Hispanic white boys and 15% for non-Hispanic white 
girls, 20% for non-Hispanic black boys and 29% for non-Hispanic black girls, and 
27% for Mexican American boys and 17% for Mexican American girls.1
•
Overall, 19% of US children and adolescents 6 to 19 years of age have BMI-for-
age values ≥95th percentile of the 2000 CDC growth charts for the United States 
(NHANES [2007–2008], NCHS).1
•
NHANES 2003 to 2006 found that 11.3% of children and adolescents 2 to 19 years 
of age were at or above the 97th percentile of the 2000 BMI-for-age growth chart, 
16.3% were ≥95th percentile, and 31.9% were ≥85th percentile.2

Data from the NHANES in the 2008 National Healthcare Quality Report found 
that3:
—
During 2003 to 2006, 39.4% of overweight (≥95th percentile of the 2000 
BMI-for-age growth chart) children and teens 2 to 19 years of age were 
told by a doctor or health professional that they were overweight.
—
During 2003 to 2006, overweight children 2 to 5 years of age (22.3%) and 
6 to 11 years of age (35.70%) were less likely than overweight children 
12 to 19 years of age (47.5%) to be told by a provider that they were 
overweight.
•
A study of >8500 4-year-olds in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth 
Cohort (National Center for Education Statistics) found that 1 in 5 are obese. 
Almost 13% of Asian children, 16% of white children, nearly 21% of black 
children, 22% of Hispanic children, and 31% of American Indian children were 
obese. Children were considered obese if their BMI was ≥95th percentile, based on 
CDC BMI growth charts. For 4-year-olds, that would be a BMI of ≈18 kg/m2. 
Researchers did not examine reasons for the disparities.4
•
Overweight adolescents have a 70% chance of becoming overweight adults. This 
increases to 80% if 1 or both parents are overweight or obese.5
•
Childhood sociodemographic factors may contribute to sex disparities in obesity 
prevalence. A study of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent 
Health found that parental education consistently modified sex disparity in blacks. 
The sex gap was largest in those with low parental education (16.7% of men 
compared with 45.4% of women were obese) and smallest in those with high 
parental education (28.5% of men compared with 31.4% of women were obese). In 
whites, there was little overall sex difference in obesity prevalence.6
•
The obesity epidemic is disproportionally more rampant among children living in 
low-income, low-education, and higher-unemployment households according to 
data from the National Survey of Children’s Health.7
Adults
•
Overall, 68% of US adults were overweight or obese (72% of men and 64% of 
women).8
•
Among men, Mexican-Americans (80%) and non-Hispanic whites (73%) were 
more likely to be overweight or obese than non-Hispanic blacks (69%) according to 
NHANES 2007 to 2008.8
•
Among women, non-Hispanic blacks (78%) and Mexican-Americans (77%) were 
more likely to be overweight or obese than non-Hispanic whites (61%).8
•
Of US adults, 34% were obese (32% of men and 36% of women) according to 
NHANES 2007 to 2008.8
•
Among men, non-Hispanic blacks (37%) and Mexican-Americans (36%) were 
more likely to be obese than non-Hispanic whites (32%).8

•
Among women, non-Hispanic blacks (50%) and Mexican-Americans (45%) were 
more likely to be obese than non-Hispanic whites (33%).8
•
When estimates were based on self-reported height and weight in the BRFSS/CDC 
survey in 2008, the prevalence of obesity ranged from 19.1% in Colorado to 33.3% 
in Mississippi. The median percentage by state was 26.6%. Additionally, no state 
met the Healthy People 2010 goal of reducing obesity to 15% of adults.9
•
The county-level prevalence of obesity in the United States ranged from 12.4% to 
43.7% with a median of 28.4% according to BRFSS/CDC 2007.10
•
In 1998 and 1999, surveys of people in 8 states and the District of Columbia by the 
BRFSS study of the CDC indicated that obesity rates were significantly higher 
among people with disabilities, especially blacks and those 45 to 64 years of age.11
•
Blacks ≥18 years of age (27.6%), American Indians or Alaska Natives (29.1%), and 
whites (35.9%) were less likely than Asians (53.4%) to be at a healthy weight 
based on self-reported height and weight data from the 2009 NHIS.12
•
Based on self-reported weights and heights, data showed that blacks ≥18 years of 
age (37.6%) and American Indians or Alaska Natives (34.4%) were more likely to 
be obese than were whites (26.6%) and Asians (9.0%) according to 2009 data from 
the NHIS.12
•
Most adults in Asian subgroups were in the healthy weight range, with rates 
ranging from 51% for Filipino adults to 68% for Chinese adults. Although the 
prevalence of obesity is low within the Asian adult population, Filipino adults 
(14%) were more than twice as likely to be obese (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) as Asian Indian 
(6%), Vietnamese (5%), or Chinese (4%) adults.13
•
From 1999 to 2004, obese adults 45 to 64 years of age (73%) and ≥65 years of age 
(73.6%) were more likely than those 20 to 44 years of age (59.5%) to be told by a 
doctor or health professional that they were overweight. Obese adults 45 to 64 
years of age and ≥65 years of age were more likely to receive advice about exercise 
than those 18 to 44 years of age.3
•
Approximately 64.8% of obese adults were told by a doctor or health professional 
that they were overweight according to the 2008 National Healthcare Disparities 
Report (based on NHANES 2003 to 2006).14
•
The proportion of obese adults told that they were overweight was significantly 
lower for non-Hispanic blacks (60.5%) and Mexican Americans (57.1%) than for 
non-Hispanic whites (66.4%), for middle-income people than for high-income 
people (62.4% versus 70.6%), and for adults with less than a high school education 
than for those with any college education (59.2% versus 70.3%).14
•
A large proportion of white, black, and Hispanic participants were overweight 
(60% to 85%) or obese (30% to 50%), whereas fewer Chinese American 
participants were overweight (33%) or obese (5%), as judged by an analysis of data 
from MESA. These findings may be indicators of potential future increases in

vascular disease burden and healthcare costs associated with the obesity 
epidemic.15
Trends
Youth
•
The prevalence of BMI-for-age values ≥95th percentile of the 2000 CDC growth 
charts in children 6 to 11 years of age was 20% in 2007 to 2008 compared with 
4.0% in 1971 to 1974. The prevalence of BMI-for-age values ≥95th percentile in 
adolescents 12 to 19 years of age was 18% in 2007 to 2008 compared with 6% in 
1971 to 1974 in NHANES. No statistically significant linear trends in high weight 
for recumbent length or high BMI were found over the time periods 1999 to 2000, 
2001 to 2002, 2003 to 2004, 2005 to 2006, and 2007 to 2008 among girls and boys 
except among the very heaviest 6- through 19-year-old boys.1
•
Among infants and children between 6 and 23 months years of age, the prevalence 
of high weight for age was 7% in 1976 to 1980 and 12% in 2003 to 2006 
(NHANES, NCHS).16
•
The obesity epidemic in children continues to grow on the basis of recent data from 
the Bogalusa Heart Study. Compared with 1973 to 1974, the proportion of children 
5 to 17 years of age who were obese was 5 times higher in 2008 to 2009.17
Adults
•
Analysis of the FHS, 1971 to 2001 (NHLBI), showed that among normal-weight 
white adults between 30 and 59 years of age, the 4-year rates of developing 
overweight varied from 14% to 19% in women and from 26% to 30% in men. The 
30-year risk was similar for both sexes, with some variation by age. Overall, the 
30-year risk for “overweight or more” exceeded 1 in 2 people, 1 in 4 for obesity, 
and 1 in 10 for stage II obesity (BMI ≥35 kg/m2) across different age groups. The 
30-year estimates correspond to the lifetime risk for “overweight or more” or 
obesity for participants 50 years of age.18
•
The age-adjusted prevalence of obesity among adults increased between 1976 to 
1980 and 1988 to 1994 and again between 1988 to 1994 and 1999 to 2000 based on 
NHANES data. Over the 10-year period of 1999 to 2008, obesity showed no 
significant trend among women. For men, there was a significant linear trend. 
Obesity prevalence for men was 28% in NHANES 1999 to 2000 (NCHS) and 32% 
in NHANES 2007 to 2008; for women, obesity prevalence was 33% in 1999 to 
2000 and 36% in 2007 to 2008.8
•
Thirty-five percent of noninstitutionalized women 65 to 74 years of age and 27% of 
women ≥75 years of age were obese on the basis of NHANES/NCHS data in 2007 
to 2008. This is an increase from 1988 to 1994, when 27% of women 65 to 74 years 
of age and 19% of women ≥75 years of age were obese. For men, from 1988 to 
1994, 24% of those 65 to 74 years of age and 13% of those ≥75 years of age were 
obese compared with 40% of those 65 to 74 years of age and 26% of those ≥75 
years of age in 2007 to 2008.19

•
The prevalence of obesity increased by 5.6% or ≈2.7 million from 1997 to 2002 in 
Medicare beneficiaries. By 2002, 21.4% of beneficiaries and 39.3% of disabled 
beneficiaries were obese compared with 16.4% and 32.5%, respectively, in 1997. 
The rise in obesity, along with expansions in treatment coverage, could greatly 
increase obesity-related Medicare spending.20
•
The WHO estimates that by 2015, the number of overweight people globally will 
increase to 2.3 billion, and 700 million will be obese. Globally, at least 20 million 
children <5 years of age were overweight in 2005. Once considered a problem only 
in high-income countries, overweight and obesity are now dramatically on the rise 
in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in urban settings.21
Morbidity
•
Overweight children and adolescents are at increased risk for future adverse health 
effects, including22:
—
Increased prevalence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as 
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and DM.
—
Poor school performance, tobacco use, alcohol use, premature sexual 
behavior, poor diet, and DM.
—
Other associated health conditions such as asthma, hepatic steatosis, sleep 
apnea, stroke, some cancers (breast, colon, and kidney), musculoskeletal 
disorders, and gallbladder disease.
•
The increasing prevalence of obesity is driving an increased incidence of type 2 
DM. Data from the FHS indicate a doubling in the incidence of DM over the past 
30 years, most dramatically during the 1990s and primarily among individuals with 
a BMI >30 kg/m2.23
•
Obesity was the most powerful predictor of DM in the Nurses’ Health Study. 
Women with a BMI of ≥35 kg/m2 had an RR for DM of 38.8 compared with 
women with a BMI of <23 kg/m2.24
•
Overweight and obesity were associated with increased risk for cardiovascular 
disease in the FHS. The age-adjusted relative risk for CVD was increased by 21% 
in men and 20% in women among those who were overweight and 46% in men and 
64% in women among those who were obese.25
•
Abdominal obesity is an independent risk factor for ischemic stroke in all race/
ethnic groups. This effect is larger for those <65 years of age (OR, 4.4) than for 
those >65 years of age (OR, 2.2; NOMAS, NINDS).26
•
A recent comparison of risk factors in both the Honolulu Heart Program and FHS 
(NHLBI) showed that a BMI increase of ≈3 kg/m2 raised the risk of hospitalized 
thromboembolic stroke by 10% to 30%.27
•
Obesity is also a strong predictor of sleep-disordered breathing, itself strongly 
associated with the development of CVD, as well as with myriad other health

conditions, including numerous cancers, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, 
gallbladder disease, musculoskeletal disorders, and reproductive abnormalities.28
Mortality
•
Elevated childhood BMIs in the highest quartile were associated with premature 
death as an adult in a cohort of 4857 American Indian children during a median 
follow-up of 23.9 years.29
•
Among adults, obesity was associated with nearly 112 000 excess deaths (95% CI, 
53 754 to 170 064) relative to normal weight in 2000. Grade I obesity (BMI, 30 to 
<35 kg/m2) was associated with almost 30 000 of these excess deaths (95% CI, 
8534 to 68 220) and grade II to III obesity (BMI ≥35 kg/m2) with >82 000 (95% 
CI, 44 843 to 119 289). Underweight was associated with nearly 34 000 excess 
deaths (95% CI, 15 726 to 51). As other studies have found,30 overweight (BMI, 25 
to <30 kg/m2) was not associated with excess deaths.31
•
Overweight was associated with significantly increased mortality resulting from 
DM or kidney disease and was not associated with increased mortality resulting 
from cancer or CVD in an analysis of 2004 data from NHANES. Obesity was 
associated with significantly increased mortality caused by CVD, some cancers, 
and DM or kidney disease. Obesity was associated with 13% of CVD deaths in 
2004.32
•
Data from NHANES 1988 to 1994 were studied to determine estimates of excess 
deaths associated with BMI and other anthropometric variables. Estimates for all-
cause mortality, obesity-related causes of death, and other causes of death showed 
no statistically significant or systematic differences between BMI and other 
variables.33
•
In a collaborative analysis of data from almost 900 000 adults in 57 prospective 
studies, mostly in Western Europe and North America, overall mortality was lowest 
at ≈22.5 to 25 kg/m2 in both sexes and at all ages, after exclusion of early follow-
up and adjustment for smoking status. Above this range, each 5-kg/m2-higher BMI 
was associated with ≈30% higher all-cause mortality, and no specific cause of 
death was inversely associated with BMI. Below 22.5 to 25 kg/m2, the overall 
inverse association with BMI was due predominantly to strong inverse associations 
for smoking-related respiratory disease, and the only clearly positive association 
was for ischemic heart disease.34
•
Overweight and obesity were associated with large decreases in life expectancy in 
an analysis of data from FHS (NHLBI). Forty-year-old female nonsmokers lost 3.3 
years and 40-year-old male nonsmokers lost 3.1 years of life expectancy because of 
overweight. In 40-year-old nonsmokers, women lost 7.1 years and men lost 5.8 
years because of obesity. Obese female smokers lost 7.2 years and obese male 
smokers lost 6.7 years compared with normal-weight nonsmokers.35

•
Recent calculations based on NHANES data from 1978 to 2006 suggest that the 
gains in life expectancy from smoking cessation are beginning to be outweighed by 
the loss of life expectancy from obesity.36
•
As a result of the increasing prevalence of obesity, the number of quality-adjusted 
life years lost as a result of obesity is similar to or greater than that lost as a result 
of smoking based on data from the BRFSS.37
•
Recent estimates suggest that reductions in smoking, cholesterol, BP, and PA levels 
resulted in a gain of 2 770 500 life-years. However, these gains were reduced by a 
loss of 715 000 life-years owing to the increased prevalence of obesity and DM.38
Cost
•
Among children and adolescents, annual hospital costs related to obesity were $127 
million between 1997 and 1999.39
•
According to 1 study, overall estimates show that the annual medical burden of 
obesity has increased to almost 10% of all medical spending and could amount to 
$147 billion per year in 2008 (in 2008 dollars).40
•
If current trends in the growth of obesity continue, total healthcare costs 
attributable to obesity could reach $861 to $957 billion by 2030, which would 
account for 16% to 18% of US health expenditures.41
•
The total excess cost related to the current prevalence of adolescent overweight and 
obesity is estimated to be $254 billion, $208 billion in lost productivity secondary 
to premature morbidity and mortality, and $46 billion in direct medical costs.42

Prevalence
Youth
•
In SEARCH, the prevalence of DM in youths <20 years of age in 2001 in the 
United States was 1.82 cases per 1000 youths (0.79 per 1000 among youths 0 to 9 
years of age and 2.80 per 1000 among youths 10 to 19 years of age). Non-Hispanic 
white youths had the highest prevalence (1.06 per 1000) in the younger group. 
Among youths 10 to 19 years of age, black youths (3.22 per 1000) and non-
Hispanic white youths (3.18 per 1000) had the highest rates, followed by American 
Indian youths (2.28 per 1000), Hispanic youths (2.18 per 1000), and Asian/Pacific 
Islander youths (1.34 per 1000). Among younger children, type 1 DM accounted 
for ≥80% of DM; among older youths, the proportion of type 2 DM ranged from 
6% (0.19 per 1000 for non-Hispanic white youths) to 76% (1.74 per 1000 for 
American Indian youths). This translates to 154 369 youths with physician-
diagnosed DM in 2001 in the United States, for an overall prevalence estimate for 
DM in children and adolescents of ≈0.18%.1
•
Approximately 186 000 people <20 years of age have DM. Each year, ≈15 000 
people <20 years of age are diagnosed with type 1 DM. Healthcare providers are 
finding more and more children with type 2 DM, a disease usually diagnosed in 
adults ≥40 years of age. Children who develop type 2 DM are typically overweight 
or obese and have a family history of the disease. Most are American Indian, black, 
Asian, or Hispanic/Latino.2
•
Among adolescents 10 to 19 years of age diagnosed with DM, 57.8% of blacks 
were diagnosed with type 2 versus type 1 DM compared with 46.1% of Hispanic 
and 14.9% of white youths.3
•
According to the Bogalusa Heart Study, a long-term follow-up study of youths 
aging into adulthood, youths who were prediabetic or who had DM are more likely 
to have a constellation of metabolic disorders in young adulthood (19 to 44 years of 
age), including obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome, all of 
which predispose to CHD.4
Adult
•
On the basis of data from NHANES 2005 to 2008 (NCHS; unpublished NHLBI 
tabulation) (Table 16-1), an estimated 18 300 000 Americans ≥20 years of age have 
physician-diagnosed DM. An additional 7 100 000 adults have undiagnosed DM 
and about 81 500 000 adults have prediabetes (eg, fasting blood glucose of 100 to 
<126 mg/dL). The prevalence of prediabetes in the US adult population is nearly 
37%.

•
Data from NHANES 2005 to 2006 (NCHS) showed the prevalence of diagnosed 
DM in adults ≥65 years of age to be 17.0%. The prevalence of undiagnosed DM 
was 14.6% (based on fasting glucose or oral glucose tolerance testing).5
•
Among Americans ≥20 years of age, 7.7% have diagnosed DM. Women ≥20 years 
of age have a slightly higher prevalence (8.3%) than men (7.2%) (NHANES) 
(NCHS).5
•
Data from NHANES (NCHS) show a disproportionately high prevalence of DM in 
non-Hispanic blacks compared with non-Hispanic whites.5
•
After adjustment for population age differences, 2004 to 2006 national survey data 
for people ≥20 years of age indicate that 6.6% of non-Hispanic whites, 7.5% of 
Asian Americans, 10.4% of Hispanics, and 11.8% of non-Hispanic blacks had 
diagnosed DM.6
•
In 2004 to 2006, the prevalence of diagnosed DM was more than twice as high for 
Asian Indian adults (14%) as for Chinese (6%) or Japanese (5%) adults.7
•
Type 2 DM accounts for 90% to 95% of all diagnosed cases of DM in adults.8 In 
Framingham, MA, 99% of DM is type 2.9
•
The prevalence of DM increased by 8.2% from 2000 to 2001. From 1990 to 2001, 
the prevalence of those diagnosed with DM increased 61%.10
•
On the basis of 2009 BRFSS (CDC) data, the prevalence of adults who reported 
ever having been told by a physician that they had DM ranged from 5.8% in Alaska 
and Colorado to 12.4% in West Virginia. The median percentage among states was 
8.3%.11
•
The CDC analyzed data from 1994 to 2004 collected by the Indian Health Service 
that indicated that the age-adjusted prevalence per 1000 population of DM 
increased 101.2% among American Indian/Alaska Native adults <35 years of age 
(from 8.5% to 17.1%). During this time period, the prevalence of diagnosed DM 
was greater among females than males in all age groups.12
•
The prevalence of DM for all age groups worldwide was estimated to be 2.8% in 
2000 and is projected to be 4.4% in 2030. The total number of people with DM is 
projected to rise from 171 million in 2000 to 366 million in 2030.13
•
On the basis of projections from NHANES/NCHS studies between 1984 and 2004, 
the total prevalence of DM in the United States is expected to more than double 
from 2005 to 2050 (from 5.6% to 12.0%) in all age, sex, and race/ethnicity groups. 
Increases are projected to be largest for the oldest age groups (for instance, 
increasing by 220% among those 65 to 74 years of age and by 449% among those 
≥75 years of age). DM prevalence is projected to increase by 99% among non-
Hispanic whites, by 107% among non-Hispanic blacks, and by 127% among 
Hispanics. The age/race/ethnicity group with the largest increase is expected to be 
blacks ≥75 years of age (increase of 606%).14

Incidence
Youths
•
In the SEARCH study, the incidence of DM in youths overall was 24.3 per 100 000 
person-years. Among children <10 years of age, most had type 1 DM, regardless of 
race/ethnicity. The highest rates of incident type 1 DM were observed in non-
Hispanic white youths (18.6, 28.1, and 32.9 per 100 000 person-years for age 
groups of 0 to 4, 5 to 9, and 10 to 14 years, respectively). Overall, type 2 DM was 
relatively infrequent, with the highest rates (17.0 to 49.4 per 100 000 person-years) 
seen among 15- to 19-yearold minority groups.3
Adults
•
A total of 1 600 000 new cases of DM were diagnosed in people ≥20 years of age 
in 2006.6
•
Data from Framingham, MA, indicate a doubling in the incidence of DM over the 
past 30 years, most dramatically during the 1990s. Among adults 40 to 55 years of 
age in each decade of the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, the age-adjusted 8-year 
incidence rates of DM were 2.0%, 3.0%, and 3.7% among women and 2.7%, 3.6%, 
and 5.8% among men, respectively. Compared with the 1970s, the age- and sex-
adjusted OR for DM was 1.40 in the 1980s and 2.05 in the 1990s (P for trend = 
0.0006). Most of the increase in absolute incidence of DM occurred in individuals 
with a BMI ≥30 kg/m2 (P for trend = 0.03).15
•
DM incidence in adults also varies markedly by race. Over 5 years of follow-up in 
45- to-84-year-olds in the MESA, 8.2% of the cohort developed DM. The 
cumulative incidence was highest in Hispanics (11.3%), followed by black (9.5%), 
Chinese (7.7%), and white (6.3%) participants.16
Mortality
DM mortality in 2007 was 71 382. Any-mention mortality in 2007 was 231 402 (NHLBI 
tabulation of NCHS mortality data).
•
The 2007 overall underlying-cause death rate owing to DM was 22.5. Death rates 
per 100 000 people were 24.6 for white males, 45.9 for black males, 17.2 for white 
females, and 40.2 for black females (NCHS, Health Data Interactive Web site 
http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/hdi; accessed July 19, 2010).
•
According to data from the National Diabetes Information Clearinghouse, the 
National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), and 
the National Institutes of Health (NIH):
—
At least 65% of people with DM die of some form of HD or stroke.
—
HD death rates among adults with DM are 2 to 4 times higher than the 
rates for adults without DM.17
•
FHS/NHLBI data show that having DM significantly increased the risk of 
developing CVD (HR, 2.5 for women and 2.4 for men) and of dying when CVD

was present (HR, 2.2 for women and 1.7 for men). Diabetic men and women ≥50 
years of age lived an average of 7.5 and 8.2 years less than their nondiabetic 
equivalents. The differences in life expectancy free of CVD were 7.8 and 8.4 years, 
respectively.18
•
Analysis of data from NHANES 1971 to 2000 found that men with DM 
experienced a 43% relative reduction in the age-adjusted mortality rate, which is 
similar to that of nondiabetic men. Among women with DM, however, mortality 
rates did not decrease, and the difference in mortality rates between diabetic and 
nondiabetic women doubled.19
•
During 1979 to 2004, DM death rates for black youths 1 to 19 years of age were 
approximately twice those for white youths. During 2003 to 2004, the annual 
average DM death rate per 1 million youths was 2.46 for black youths and 0.91 for 
white youths.20
•
Analysis of data from the FHS from 1950 to 2005 found reductions in all-cause and 
CVD mortality among men and women with and without DM. However, all-cause 
and CVD mortality rates among individuals with DM remain ≈2-fold higher 
compared with individuals without DM.21
Awareness
•
The NIDDK estimates that 23.6 million Americans (7.8% of the population) have 
DM.6
•
Analysis of NHANES/NCHS data from 1988 to 1994 to 1999 to 2005 to 2006 in 
adults ≥20 years of age showed that 40% of those with DM did not know they had 
it.5 Although the prevalence of diagnosed DM has increased significantly over the 
past decade, the prevalences of undiagnosed DM and impaired fasting glucose have 
remained relatively stable. Minority groups remain disproportionately affected.22
•
Analysis of NHANES/NCHS data collected during 2005 to 2008 indicated that the 
prevalence of DM was 8.2% among people ≥20 years of age. Prevalence of DM 
was defined as people who were told by a physician or other health professional 
that they have DM. Of the estimated 18 300 adults with DM, 73.3% were told or 
were on treatment and 26.7% (5.7 million) were unaware of the diagnosis. Of 7 895 
000 people being treated (37.3% of the diabetic population), one third of them (2 
604 000) were controlled (ie, on treatment with fasting plasma glucose <126 
mg/dL) and 25.0% (5 300 000) were treated and uncontrolled (fasting plasma 
glucose ≥126 mg/dL). An estimated 13 300 000 individuals with DM are not 
treated. The untreated and unaware population (5 600 000) was 26.7% of the 
diabetic population (NHLBI tabulation of NHANES 2003 to 2006) (see Chart 
16-4).
Aftermath
•
Although the exact date of DM onset can be difficult to determine, duration of DM 
appears to affect CVD risk. Longitudinal data from Framingham, MA, suggest that 
the risk factor–adjusted relative risk of CHD was 1.38 (95% CI, 0.99 to 1.92) times 
Roger et al.

higher and the risk for CHD death was 1.86 (95% CI, 1.17 to 2.93) times higher for 
each 10-year increase in duration of DM.23
•
DM increases the risk of stroke, with the RR ranging from 1.8 to almost 6.0.24
•
Ischemic stroke patients with DM are younger, more likely to be black, and more 
likely to have hypertension, MI, and high cholesterol than nondiabetic patients. DM 
increases ischemic stroke incidence at all ages, but this risk is most prominent 
before 55 years of age in blacks and before 65 years of age in whites.25
•
On the basis of data from the NCHS/NHIS, 1997 to 2005:26
—
During 1997 to 2005, the estimated number of people ≥35 years of age 
with DM with a self-reported cardiovascular condition increased 36%, 
from 4.2 million in 1997 to 5.7 million in 2005. However, the age-
adjusted prevalence of self-reported CVD conditions among people with 
diagnosed DM ≥35 years of age decreased 11.2%, from 36.6% in 1997 to 
32.5% in 2005.
—
During 1997 to 2005, age-adjusted CVD prevalence was higher among 
men than women, among whites than blacks, and among non-Hispanics 
than Hispanics. Among women, the age-adjusted prevalence decreased by 
11.2%; among men, it did not decrease significantly. Among blacks, the 
age-adjusted prevalence of self-reported CVD decreased by 25.3%; 
among whites, no significant decrease occurred; among non-Hispanics, 
the rate decreased by 12%. No clear trends were detected among 
Hispanics. If the total number of people with DM and self-reported CVD 
increased over this period but proportions with self-reported CVD 
declined, the data suggest that the mean age at which people have been 
diagnosed is decreasing, or the higher CVD mortality rate among older 
diabetic individuals is removing them from ability to self-report CVD. 
These and other data show a consistent increase over time in the United 
States of the number of people with DM and CVD.
•
Statistical modeling of the use and effectiveness of specific cardiac treatments and 
of changes in risk factors between 1980 and 2000 among US adults 25 to 84 years 
of age showed that the age-adjusted death rate for CHD decreased from 543 to 267 
deaths per 100 000 population among men and from 263 to 134 deaths per 100 000 
population among women. Approximately 47% of this decrease was attributed to 
treatments, and ≈44% was attributed to changes in risk factors, although reductions 
were offset in part by increases in BMI and the prevalence of DM, which accounted 
for an increased number of deaths (8% and 10%, respectively).27 An analysis from 
the Cooper Clinic in Dallas, TX, of exercise electrocardiographic responses and 
CVD mortality in 2854 men with DM reported 441 deaths (210 CVD and 133 
CHD) over a follow-up of 16 years. That analysis showed that equivocal and 
abnormal exercise electrocardiographic responses were associated with higher risk 
of all-cause, CVD, and CHD mortality. Across normal, equivocal, and abnormal 
exercise electrocardiographic groups, age- and examination year–adjusted CHD

mortality rates per 10 000 person-years were 23.0, 48.6, and 69.0, respectively (P 
for trend <0.001), and risk factor–adjusted HRs were 1.00, 1.68 (95% CI, 1.01 to 
2.77), and 2.21 (95% CI, 1.41 to 3.46; P for trend <0.001), respectively.28
•
A subgroup analysis was conducted of patients with DM enrolled in randomized 
clinical trials that evaluated ACS therapies. The data included 62 036 patients from 
TIMI studies (46 577 with STEMI and 15 459 with unstable angina/non-STEMI 
[UA/NSTEMI]). Of these, 17.1% had DM. Modeling showed that mortality at 30 
days was significantly higher among patients with DM than among those without 
DM who presented with UA/NSTEMI (2.1% versus 1.1%; P≤0.001) and STEMI 
(8.5% versus 5.4%; P = 0.001), with adjusted risks for 30-day mortality in DM 
versus no DM of 1.78 for UA/NSTEMI (95% CI, 1.24 to 2.56) and 1.40 (95% CI, 
1.24 to 1.57) for STEMI. DM was also associated with significantly higher 
mortality 1 year after UA/NSTEMI or STEMI. By 1 year after ACS, patients with 
DM presenting with UA/NSTEMI had a risk of death that approached that of 
patients without DM presenting with STEMI (7.2% versus 8.1%).29
•
Data from the ARIC study of the NHLBI found that DM was a weaker predictor of 
CHD in blacks than in whites.30
•
Data from Framingham, MA, show that despite improvements in CVD morbidity 
and mortality, DM continues to elevate CVD risk. Participants 45 to 64 years of 
age from the FHS original and offspring cohorts who attended examinations in 
1950 to 1966 (“earlier” time period) and 1977 to 1995 (“later” time period) were 
followed up for incident MI, CHD death, and stroke. Among participants with DM, 
the age- and sex-adjusted CVD incidence rate was 286.4 per 10 000 person-years in 
the earlier period and 146.9 per 10 000 person-years in the later period, a 35.4% 
decline. HRs for DM as a predictor of incident CVD were not significantly 
different in the earlier (risk factor–adjusted HR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.88 to 3.82) versus 
later (HR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.44 to 2.66) periods.31 Thus, although there was a 50% 
reduction in the rate of incident CVD events among adults with DM, the absolute 
risk of CVD remained 2-fold greater than among people without DM.31
—
Data from these earlier and later time periods in Framingham also suggest 
that the increasing prevalence of DM is leading to an increasing rate of 
CVD, resulting in part from CVD risk factors that commonly accompany 
DM. The age- and sex-adjusted HR for DM as a CVD risk factor was 3.0 
in the earlier time period and 2.5 in the later time period. Because the 
prevalence of DM has increased over time, the population-attributable 
risk for DM as a CVD risk factor increased from 5.4% in the earlier time 
period to 8.7% in the later time period (attributable risk ratio, 1.62; P = 
0.04). Adjustment for CVD risk factors (age, sex, hypertension, current 
smoking, high cholesterol, and obesity) weakened this attributable risk 
ratio to 1.5 (P = 0.12).32
—
Other data from Framingham show that over 30 years, CVD among 
women with DM was 54.8% among normal-weight women but 78.8%

among obese women. Among normal-weight men with DM, the lifetime 
risk of CVD was 78.6%, whereas it was 86.9% among obese men.33
•
Other studies show that the increased prevalence of DM is being followed by an 
increasing prevalence of CVD morbidity and mortality. New York City death 
certificate data for 1989 to 1991 and 1999 to 2001 and hospital discharge data for 
1988 to 2002 show increases in all-cause and cause-specific mortality between 
1990 and 2000, as well as in annual hospitalization rates for DM and its 
complications among patients hospitalized with AMI and/or DM. During this 
decade, all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates declined, although not for 
patients with DM; rates increased 61% and 52% for diabetic men and women, 
respectively, as did hospitalization rates for DM and its complications. The 
percentage of all AMIs occurring in patients with DM increased from 21% to 36%, 
and the absolute number more than doubled, from 2951 to 6048. Although hospital 
days for AMI fell overall, for those with DM, they increased 51% (from 34 188 to 
51 566). These data suggest that increases in DM rates threaten the long-established 
nationwide trend toward reduced coronary artery events.34
•
In an analysis of provincial health claims data for adults living in Ontario, Canada, 
between 1992 and 2000, the rate of patients admitted for AMI and stroke decreased 
to a greater extent in the diabetic than the nondiabetic population (AMI, −15.1% 
versus −9.1%, P = 0.0001; stroke, −24.2% versus −19.4%, P = 0.0001). Diabetic 
patients experienced reductions in case fatality rates related to AMI and stroke 
similar to those without DM (−44.1% versus −33.2%, P = 0.1; −17.1% versus 
−16.6%, P = 0.9, respectively) and similarly comparable decreases in all-cause 
mortality. Over the same period, the number of DM cases increased by 165%, 
which translates to a marked increase in the proportion of CVD events occurring 
among patients with DM: AMI, 44.6%; stroke, 26.1%; AMI deaths, 17.2%; and 
stroke deaths, 13.2%.35
•
In the same data set, the transition to a high-risk category (an event rate equivalent 
to a 10-year risk of 20% or an event rate equivalent to that associated with previous 
MI) occurred at a younger age for men and women with DM than for those without 
DM (mean difference, 14.6 years). For the outcome of AMI, stroke, or death 
resulting from any cause, diabetic men and women entered the high-risk category at 
47.9 and 54.3 years of age, respectively. The data suggest that DM confers a risk 
equivalent to aging 15 years. In North America, diverse data show lower rates of 
CVD among diabetic people, but as the prevalence of DM has increased, so has the 
absolute burden of CVD, especially among middle-aged and older individuals.36
•
HbA1c levels ≥6.5% can be used to diagnose DM.37 In the population-based ARIC 
study, HbA1c levels ≥6.5% had a 14-year follow-up, multivariable-adjusted HR for 
diagnosed DM of 16.5 (95% CI, 14.2 to 19.1) and for CHD of 1.95 (95% CI, 1.53 
to 2.48) relative to those with HbA1c <5.0%.38

Risk Factors
•
Data from the 2004 National Healthcare Disparities Report (AHRQ, US 
Department of Health and Human Services) found that only approximately one 
third of adults with DM received all 5 interventions to reduce risk factors 
recommended for comprehensive DM care in 2001. The proportion receiving all 5 
interventions was lower among blacks than whites and among Hispanics than non-
Hispanic whites.39
—
In multivariate models that controlled for age, sex, income, education, 
insurance, and residence location, blacks were 38% less likely and 
Hispanics were 33% less likely than their respective comparison groups 
to receive all recommended risk factor interventions in 2001.39
•
Between NHANES III 1988 to 1994 (NCHS) and NHANES 1999 to 2002 (NCHS), 
considerable differences were found among ethnic groups in glycemic control rates 
among adults with type 2 DM. Among non-Hispanic whites, the control rates were 
43.8% in 1988 to 1994 and 48.4% in 1999 to 2002. For non-Hispanic blacks, the 
rates were 41.2% and 36.5%, respectively. For Mexican Americans, the respective 
rates were 34.5% and 34.2%.40
•
In 1 large academic medical center, outpatients with type 2 DM were observed 
during an 18-month period for proportions of patients who had HbA1c levels, BP, 
or total cholesterol levels measured; who had been prescribed any drug therapy if 
HbA1c levels, SBP, or LDL cholesterol levels exceeded recommended treatment 
goals; and who had been prescribed greater-than-starting-dose therapy if these 
values were above treatment goals. Patients were less likely to have cholesterol 
levels measured (76%) than HbA1c levels (92%) or BP (99%; P<0.0001 for either 
comparison). The proportion of patients who received any drug therapy was greater 
for above-goal HbA1c (92%) than for above-goal SBP (78%) or LDL cholesterol 
(38%; P<0.0001 for each comparison). Similarly, patients whose HbA1c levels 
were above the treatment goal (80%) were more likely to receive greater-than-
starting-dose therapy than were those who had above-goal SBP (62%) and LDL 
cholesterol levels (13%; P<0.0001).41
—
Data from the same academic medical center also showed that CVD risk 
factors among women with DM were managed less aggressively than 
among men with DM. Women were less likely than men to have HbA1c 
<7% (without CHD: adjusted OR for women versus men, 0.84, P = 
0.005; with CHD: 0.63, P<0.0001). Women without CHD were less 
likely than men to be treated with lipid-lowering medication (0.82; P = 
0.01) or, when treated, to have LDL cholesterol levels <100 mg/dL (0.75; 
P = 0.004) and were less likely than men to be prescribed aspirin (0.63; 
P<0.0001). Women with DM and CHD were less likely than men to be 
prescribed aspirin (0.70, P<0.0001) and, when treated for hypertension or 
hyperlipidemia, were less likely to have BP levels <130/80 mm Hg (0.75; 
P<0.0001) or LDL cholesterol levels <100 mg/dL (0.80; P = 0.006).42

•
In 2001 to 2002, among adults ≥18 years of age with DM, 50.2% were not at goal 
for HbA1c (<7%), 64.6% were not at goal for LDL cholesterol (<100 mg/dL), and 
53% were not at goal for BP (<130/80 mm Hg). Moreover, 48.6% were not at 
recommended levels of triglycerides (<150 mg/dL in women). Only 5.3% of men 
and 12.7% of women were simultaneously at goal for HbA1c, LDL cholesterol, and 
BP.43
•
Analysis of data from the CHS study of the NHLBI found that lifestyle risk factors, 
including physical activity level, dietary habits, smoking habits, alcohol use, and 
adiposity measures, assessed late in life, were each independently associated with 
risk of new-onset DM. Participants whose PA level and dietary, smoking, and 
alcohol habits were all in the low-risk group had an 82% lower incidence of DM 
compared with all other participants. When absence of adiposity was added to the 
other 4 low-risk lifestyle factors, incidence of DM was 89% lower.44
•
Aggressive treatment of hypertension is recommended for adults with DM to 
prevent cardiovascular complications. Between NHANES III (1984 to 1992) and 
NHANES 1999 to 2004, the proportion of patients with DM whose BP was treated 
increased from 76.5% to 87.8%, and the proportion whose BP was controlled 
nearly doubled (15.9% to 29.6%).45
Hospitalizations
Youth
•
National Inpatient Sample data from 1993 to 2004 were analyzed for individuals 0 
to 29 years of age with a diagnosis of DM. Rates of hospitalizations increased by 
38%. Hospitalization rates were higher for females (42%) than for males (29%). 
Inflation-adjusted total charges for DM hospitalizations increased 130%, from 
$1.05 billion in 1993 to $2.42 billion in 2004.46
Cost
In 2007, the direct ($116 billion) and indirect ($58 billion) cost attributable to DM was $174 
billion.6 These estimates include not just DM as a primary diagnosis but also DM-related 
long-term complications that are attributed to DM.47
A study of data from NHANES 2003 to 2006, Ingenix Research DataMart, 2003 to 2005 
National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, the 2003 to 2005 National Hospital Ambulatory 
Medical Care Survey, the 2004 to 2005 Nationwide Inpatient Sample, and the 2003 to 2005 
Medical Expenditure Panel Survey found that the estimated economic cost of undiagnosed 
DM in 2007 was $18 billion, including medical costs of $11 billion and indirect costs of $7 
billion.48

End-stage renal disease is a condition that is most commonly associated with DM and/or 
HBP, occurs when the kidneys are functioning at a very low level, and is currently defined 
as the receipt of chronic renal replacement treatment such as hemodialysis, peritoneal 
dialysis, or kidney transplantation. The end-stage renal disease (ESRD) population is 
increasing in size and cost as those with chronic kidney disease (CKD) transition to ESRD 
and as a result of changing practice patterns in the United States.
•
Data from the 2009 annual report of the US Renal Data System (USRDS) showed 
that in 2007, the prevalence of ESRD was 527 282, with 65% of these prevalent 
cases being treated with hemodialysis.1
•
In 2007, 110 996 new cases of ESRD were reported.1

In 2007, mortality rates for those who were receiving dialysis were 6.7 to 8.5 times 
greater than those of the general US population.1

•
In 2007, 17 513 kidney transplants were performed.2
•
Data from a large cohort of insured patients found that in addition to established 
risk factors for ESRD, lower hemoglobin levels, higher serum uric acid levels, self-
reported history of nocturia, and family history of kidney disease are independent 
risk factors for ESRD.3
•
Data from a large insured population revealed that among adults with a glomerular 
filtration rate (GFR) >60 mL · min−1 · 1.73 m−2 and no evidence of proteinuria or 
hematuria at baseline, risks for ESRD increased dramatically with higher baseline 
BP level, and in this same patient population, BP-associated risks were greater in 
men than in women and in blacks than in whites4 (see Table 17-1).
•
Compared with white patients with similar levels of kidney function, black patients 
are much more likely to progress to ESRD and are on average 10 years younger 
when they reach ESRD.5,6
•
Results from a large community-based population showed that higher BMI also 
independently increased the risk of ESRD. The higher risk of ESRD with 
overweight and obesity was consistent across age, sex, and race and in the presence 
or absence of DM, hypertension, or known baseline kidney disease7 (see Table 
17-2).
Age, Sex, Race, and Ethnicity
•
The median age of the population with ESRD in 2007 varied across different racial/
ethnic groups: 57.1 years for blacks, 57.9 years for Native American, 59.1 years for 
Asians, and 60.3 years for whites.1
•
Treatment of ESRD is more common in men than in women.1
•
Blacks, Hispanics, Asian Americans, and Native Americans have significantly 
higher rates of ESRD than do white/Europeans. Blacks represent nearly 28% of 
treated patients with ESRD.1
Chronic Kidney Disease
Prevalence
•
CKD, defined as reduced GFR and/or excess urinary protein excretion, is a serious 
health condition and a worldwide public health problem. The incidence and 
prevalence of CKD are increasing in the United States and are associated with poor 
outcomes and a high cost to the US healthcare system. Controversy exists about 
whether CKD itself independently causes incident CVD, but it is clear that people 
with CKD, as well as those with ESRD, represent a population at very high risk for 
CVD events. In fact, individuals with CKD are more likely to die of CVD than to 
transition to ESRD. The USRDS estimates that by 2020, >700 000 Americans will 
have ESRD, with >500 000 requiring dialysis and >250 000 receiving a transplant.1
•
The National Kidney Foundation (NKF) Kidney Disease Outcome Quality 
Initiative (K/DOQI) developed guidelines in 2002 that provided a standardized

definition for CKD. Prevalence estimates may differ depending on assumptions 
used in obtaining estimates, including which equation is used to estimate GFR and 
methods for measuring proteinuria.8 The most recent US prevalence estimates of 
CKD, with the use of K/DOQI guidelines, come from NHANES 1999 to 2004 
(NCHS) in adults ≥20 years of age9:
—
The prevalence of CKD (stages I to V)10 is 16.8%.9 This represents an 
increase from the 14.5% prevalence estimate from NHANES 1988 to 
1994 (NCHS; recalculated).9
—
The prevalence of GFR ≥90 mL · min−1 · 1.73 m−2 with kidney damage 
(ie, presence of albuminuria) is 5.7%.
—
The prevalence of stage II CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate 
(eGFR), 60 to 89 mL · min−1 · 1.73 m−2 with kidney damage) is 5.4%.
—
The prevalence of stage III CKD (eGFR, 30 to 59 mL · min−1 · 1.73 m−2) 
is 5.4%.
—
The prevalence of stages IV and V CKD (eGFR <29 mL · min−1 · 1.73 
m−2) is 0.4%.
•
Nearly 26 million people (13%) in the United States have CKD, and most are 
undiagnosed.11 Another 20 million are at increased risk for CKD.2
Demographics
•
Using current definitions, the prevalence of CKD is higher with older age:1
—
5.7% for those 20 to 39 years of age;
—
5.7% for those 40 to 59 years of age; and
—
37.8% for those ≥60 years of age.
•
CKD prevalence was greater among those with DM (43.7%) and hypertension 
(28.0%) than among those without these chronic conditions.1
•
The prevalence of CKD was slightly higher among Mexican Americans (18.7%) 
and non-Hispanic blacks (19.9%) than among non-Hispanic whites (16.1%). This 
disparity was most evident for those with stage I CKD; non-Hispanic whites had a 
CKD prevalence of 4.2% compared with prevalences among Mexican Americans 
and non-Hispanic blacks of 10.2% and 9.4%, respectively.9
Risk Factors
•
Many traditional CVD risk factors are also risk factors for CKD, including older 
age, male sex, hypertension, DM, smoking, and family history of CVD.
•
Other risk factors include systemic conditions such as autoimmune diseases, 
systemic infections, and drug exposure, as well as anatomically local conditions 
such as urinary tract infections, urinary stones, lower urinary tract obstruction, and 
neoplasia. Even after adjustment for these risk factors, excess CVD risk remains.12

•
Many clinical risk factors for CKD are the same as those for CVD.
•
Proteinuria is a strong independent risk factor for a decline in eGFR, regardless of 
DM status, and is associated with many of the same risk factors for CVD as for 
CKD.13,14
ESRD/CKD and CVD
•
CVD is the leading cause of death among those with ESRD, although the specific 
cardiovascular cause of death may be more likely to be arrhythmic compared with 
an acute myocardial infarction, end-stage heart failure, or stroke.
—
CVD mortality is 5 to 30 times higher in dialysis patients than in subjects 
from the general population of the same age, sex, and race.15,16
—
Individuals with less severe forms of kidney disease are also at 
significantly increased CVD risk independently of typical CVD risk 
factors.17
—
CKD is a risk factor for recurrent CVD events.18
•
Studies from a broad range of cohorts demonstrate an association between reduced 
eGFR and elevated risk of CVD, CVD outcomes, and all-cause death17,19–25 that 
appears to be largely independent of other known major CVD risk factors.
•
Any degree of albuminuria, starting below the microalbuinuria cut point, has been 
shown to be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events, CHF 
hospitalization, PAD, and all-cause death in a wide variety of cohorts.26–31
—
A recent meta-analysis of 21 published studies of albuminuria involving 
105 872 participants (730 577 person-years) from 14 studies with urine 
albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) measurements and 1 128 310 participants 
(4 732 110 person-years) from 7 studies with urine dipstick 
measurements showed that excess albuminuria or proteinuria is 
independently associated with a higher risk of CVD and all-cause 
mortality.32
—
People with both albuminuria/proteinuria and reduced eGFR are at 
particularly high risk for CVD, CVD outcomes, and death.33
—
The exact reasons why CKD and ESRD increase the risk of CVD have 
not been completely delineated but are clearly multifactorial and likely 
involve pathological alterations in multiple organ systems and pathways.
Cost–ESRD
•
The total annual cost of treating ESRD in the United States was ≈$24 billion in 
2007, representing nearly 6% of the total Medicare budget.1
•
The total annual cost associated with CKD has not been accurately determined to 
date.

Cystatin C: Kidney Function and CVD
Serum cystatin C, another marker of kidney function, has been proposed to be a more 
sensitive indicator of kidney function than serum creatinine and creatinine-based estimating 
formulas at higher levels of GFR. It is a low-molecular-weight protein produced at a 
constant rate by all nucleated cells and appears not to be affected significantly across age, 
sex, and levels of muscle mass. Cystatin C is excreted by the kidneys, filtered through the 
glomerulus, and nearly completely reabsorbed by proximal tubular cells.34 Several 
equations have been proposed using cystatin C alone and in combination with serum 
creatinine to estimate kidney function.35,36
All-Cause Mortality—Elevated levels of cystatin C have been shown to be associated 
with increased risk for all-cause mortality in studies from a broad range of cohorts.37–39
Cardiovascular Disease
•
Data from a large national cohort found higher values of cystatin C to be associated 
with prevalent stroke, angina, and MI,40 as well as higher BMI.41
•
Elevated cystatin C was an independent risk factor for HF,42,43 PAD events,44 
clinical atherosclerosis, and subclin- ical measures of CVD in older adults,45 as 
well as for cardiovascular events among those with CHD.37,46
•
In several diverse cohorts, elevated cystatin C has been found to be associated with 
CVD-related mortality,39,47,48 including sudden cardiac death.49

18. Metabolic Syndrome
•
Metabolic syndrome refers to a cluster of risk factors for CVD and type 2 DM. 
Although several different definitions for metabolic syndrome have been proposed, 
the International Diabetes Federation, NHLBI, AHA, and others recently proposed 
a harmonized definition for metabolic syndrome.1 By this definition, metabolic 
syndrome is diagnosed when ≥3 of the following 5 risk factors are present:
—
Fasting plasma glucose ≥100 mg/dL or undergoing drug treatment for

Adults
•
Prevalence of metabolic syndrome varies by the definition used, with definitions 
such as the International Diabetes Federation that suggest lower thresholds for 
defining central obesity resulting in higher prevalence estimates.2
•
On the basis of NHANES 2003 to 2006 data and National Cholesterol Education 
Program (NCEP)/ATP III guidelines, ≈34% of adults ≥20 years of age met the 
criteria for metabolic syndrome.3
•
Also based on NHANES 2003 to 2006 data3:
—
The age-adjusted prevalence was 35.1% for men and 32.6% for women.
—
Among men, the age-specific prevalence ranged from 20.3% among 
people 20 to 39 years of age to 40.8% for people 40 to 59 years of age 
and 51.5% for people ≥60 years of age. Among women, the age-specific 
prevalence ranged from 15.6% among people 20 to 39 years of age to 
37.2% for people 40 to 59 years of age and 54.4% for those ≥60 years of 
age.
—
The age-adjusted prevalences of people with metabolic syndrome were 
37.2%, 25.3%, and 33.2% for non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, 
and Mexican American men, respectively. Among women, the 
percentages were 31.5%, 38.8%, and 40.6%, respectively.
—
The age-adjusted prevalence was ≈53% higher among non-Hispanic 
black women than among non-Hispanic black men and ≈22% higher 
among Mexican American women than among Mexican American men.
•
The prevalence of metabolic syndrome is also high among immigrant Asian 
Indians, ranging between 26.8% and 38.2%, depending on the definition used.4
•
The prevalence of metabolic syndrome among pregnant women increased to 26.5% 
during 1999 to 2004 from 17.8% during 1988 to 1994.5
•
However, the public’s recognition of metabolic syndrome is limited.6
Children/Adolescents
•
An AHA scientific statement about metabolic syndrome in children and 
adolescents was released in 2009.7
•
Metabolic syndrome should be diagnosed with caution in children and adolescents 
because metabolic syndrome categorization in adolescents is not stable. 
Approximately half of the 1098 adolescent participants in the Princeton School 
District Study diagnosed with pediatric ATP III metabolic syndrome lost the 
diagnosis over 3 years of follow-up.8

•
Additional evidence of the instability of the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome in 
children exists. In children 6 to 17 years of age participating in research studies in a 
single clinical research hospital, the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome was unstable 
in 46% of cases after a mean of 5.6 years of follow-up.9
•
On the basis of NHANES 1999 to 2002 data, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome 
in adolescents 12 to 19 years of age was 9.4%, which represents ≈2.9 million 
people. It was 13.2% in boys, 5.3% in girls, 10.7% in whites, 5.2% in blacks, and 
11.1% in Mexican Americans.10
•
In 1999 to 2004, ≈4.5% of US adolescents 12 to 17 years of age had metabolic 
syndrome according to the definition developed by the International Diabetes 
Federation.11 In 2006, this prevalence would have represented ≈1.1 million 
adolescents 12 to 17 years of age with metabolic syndrome. It increased from 1.2% 
among those 12 to 13 years of age to 7.1% among those 14 to 15 years of age and 
was higher among boys (6.7%) than girls (2.1%). Furthermore, 4.5% of white 
adolescents, 3.0% of black adolescents, and 7.1% of Mexican American 
adolescents had metabolic syndrome. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome 
remained relatively stable during successive 2-year periods: 4.5% for 1999 to 2000, 
4.4% to 4.5% for 2001 to 2002, and 3.7% to 3.9% for 2003 to 2004.
•
In 1999 to 2002, among overweight or obese adolescents, 44% had metabolic 
syndrome.10 In 1988 to 1994, two thirds of all adolescents had at least 1 metabolic 
abnormality.12
•
Of 31 participants in the NHLBI Lipid Research Clinics Princeton Prevalence 
Study and the Princeton Follow-Up Study who had metabolic syndrome at 
baseline, 21 (68%) had metabolic syndrome 25 years later.13 After adjustment for 
age, sex, and race, the baseline status of metabolic syndrome was significantly 
associated with an increased risk of having metabolic syndrome during adulthood 
(OR, 6.2; 95% CI, 2.8 to 13.8).
•
In the Bogalusa Heart Study, 4 variables (BMI, homeostasis model assessment of 
insulin resistance, ratio of triglycerides to HDL cholesterol, and mean arterial 
pressure) considered to be part of the metabolic syndrome clustered together in 
blacks and whites and in children and adults.14 The degree of clustering was 
stronger among adults than children. The clustering of rates of change in the 
components of the metabolic syndrome in blacks exceeded that in whites.
•
Cardiovascular abnormalities are associated with metabolic syndrome in children 
and adolescents.15,16
Risk
Adults
•
Consistent with 2 earlier meta-analyses, a recent meta-analysis of prospective 
studies concluded that metabolic syndrome increased the risk of developing CVD 
(summary RR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.58 to 2.00).17 The risk of CVD tended to be higher 
in women (summary RR, 2.63) than in men (summary RR, 1.98; P=0.09). On the

basis of results from 3 studies, metabolic syndrome remained a predictor of 
cardiovascular events after adjustment for the individual components of the 
syndrome (summary RR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.32 to 1.79).
•
Several studies suggest that the FRS is a better predictor of incident CVD than 
metabolic syndrome.18–20 In the San Antonio Heart Study, the area under the 
receiver-operating characteristic curve (aROC) was 0.816 for the FRS and 0.811 
for the FRS plus the metabolic syndrome.18 Furthermore, the sensitivity for CVD at 
a fixed specificity was significantly higher for the FRS than for the metabolic 
syndrome. In ARIC, metabolic syndrome did not improve the risk prediction 
achieved by the FRS.19 In the British Regional Heart Study, the aROC for the FRS 
was 0.73 for incident CHD during 10 years of follow-up, and the aROC for the 
number of metabolic syndrome components was 0.63.20 For CHD events during 20 
years of follow-up, the aROCs were 0.68 for the FRS and 0.59 for the number of 
metabolic syndrome components.
•
Estimates of relative risk for CVD generally increase as the number of components 
of metabolic syndrome increases.20,21 Compared with men without an abnormal 
component in the Framingham Offspring Study, the HRs for CVD were 1.48 (95% 
CI, 0.69 to 3.16) for men with 1 or 2 components and 3.99 (95% CI, 1.89 to 8.41) 
for men with ≥3 components.21 Among women, the HRs were 3.39 (95% CI, 1.31 
to 8.81) for 1 or 2 components and 5.95 (95% CI, 2.20 to 16.11) for ≥3 
components. Compared with men without a metabolic abnormality in the British 
Regional Heart Study, the HRs were 1.74 (95% CI, 1.22 to 2.39) for 1 component, 
2.34 (95% CI, 1.65 to 3.32) for 2 components, 2.88 (95% CI, 2.02 to 4.11) for 3 
components, and 3.44 (95% CI, 2.35 to 5.03) for 4 or 5 components.20
•
The cardiovascular risk associated with the metabolic syndrome varies on the basis 
of the combination of metabolic syndrome components present. Of all possible 
ways to have 3 metabolic syndrome components, the combination of central 
obesity, elevated BP, and hyperglycemia had the greatest risk for CVD (HR, 2.36; 
95% CI, 1.54 to 3.61) and mortality (HR, 3.09; 95% CI, 1.93 to 4.94) in the 
Framingham Offspring Study.22
•
Data from the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study indicate that risk for CVD 
mortality is increased in men without DM who have metabolic syndrome (HR, 1.8; 
95% CI, 1.5 to 2.0). However, among those with metabolic syndrome, the presence 
of DM is associated with even greater risk for CVD mortality (HR, 2.1; 95% CI, 
1.7 to 2.6).23
•
Analysis of data from NCHS was used to determine the number of disease-specific 
deaths attributable to all non-optimal levels of each risk factor exposure by age and 
sex. The results of the analysis of dietary, lifestyle, and metabolic risk factors show 
that targeting a handful of risk factors has large potential to reduce mortality in the 
United States.24
•
In addition to CVD, the metabolic syndrome has also been associated with incident 
atrial fibrillation25 and HF.26

•
The metabolic syndrome is associated with increased healthcare use and 
healthcare–related costs among individuals with and without DM. Overall, 
healthcare costs increase by ≈24% for each additional metabolic syndrome 
component present.27
Children
•
Few prospective pediatric studies have examined the future risk for CVD or DM 
according to baseline metabolic syndrome status. Data from 771 participants 6 to 
19 years of age from the NHLBI’s Lipid Research Clinics Princeton Prevalence 
Study and the Princeton Follow-Up Study showed that the risk of developing CVD 
was substantially higher among those with metabolic syndrome than among those 
without this syndrome (OR, 14.6; 95% CI, 4.8 to 45.3) who were followed up for 
25 years.13
•
Another analysis of 814 participants of this cohort showed that those 5 to 19 years 
of age who had metabolic syndrome at baseline had an increased risk of having 
DM 25 to 30 years later compared with those who did not have the syndrome at 
baseline (OR, 11.5; 95% CI, 2.1 to 63.7).28
•
Additional data from the Princeton Follow-Up Study, the Fels Longitudinal Study, 
and the Muscatine Study suggest that the absence of components of the metabolic 
syndrome in childhood had a high negative predictive value for the development of 
metabolic syndrome or DM in adulthood.29
Risk Factors
•
In prospective or retrospective cohort studies, the following factors have been 
reported as being directly associated with incident metabolic syndrome, defined by 
one of the major definitions: age,28,30–32 low educational attainment,30,33 low 
socioeconomic status,34 smoking,33–36 low levels of PA,33–39 low levels of 
physical fitness,37,40–42 intake of soft drinks,43 intake of diet soda,44 magnesium

19. Nutrition
See Tables 19-1 and 19-2 and Charts 19-1 through 19-3.
This chapter of the update highlights national nutritional intake data, focusing on foods, 
nutrients, dietary patterns, and other dietary factors that are related to cardiometabolic 
health. It is intended to examine current intakes, trends and changes in intakes, and 
estimated effects on disease to support and further stimulate efforts to monitor and improve 
dietary habits in relation to cardiovascular health.
Prevalence
Foods and Nutrients: Adults—See Table 19-1; NHANES 2005 to 2006; personal 
communication with D. Mozaffarian (December 2008).
The dietary consumption by US adults of selected foods and nutrients related to 
cardiometabolic health is detailed in Table 19-1 according to sex and ethnic subgroups:
•
Average consumption of whole grains by white and black men and women was 
between 0.5 and 0.7 servings per day, with only between 3% and 5% of white and 
black adults consuming ≥3 servings per day. Average whole grain consumption by 
Mexican Americans was ≈2 servings per day, with 22% to 28% consuming ≥3 
servings per day.
•
Average fruit consumption ranged from 1.1 to 1.8 servings per day in these sex and 
ethnic subgroups; 8% to 11% of whites, 6% to 9% of blacks, and 6% to 10% of 
Mexican Americans consumed ≥4 servings per day. When 100% fruit juices were 
included, the number of servings consumed and the proportions of adults 
consuming ≥4 servings per day approximately doubled.
•
Average vegetable consumption ranged from 1.2 to 2.1 servings per day; 11% to 
14% of whites, 5% to 10% of blacks, and 3% to 5% of Mexican Americans 
consumed ≥5 servings per day. The inclusion of vegetable juices and sauces 
generally produced little change in these consumption patterns.
•
Average consumption of fish and shellfish was lowest among white women (1.4 
servings per week) and highest among black and Mexican American men (1.7 
servings per week); between 75% and >80% of adults in each sex and ethnic 
subgroup consumed <2 servings per week. Approximately 6% of whites, 7% of 
blacks, and 6% to 7% of Mexican Americans consumed ≥500 mg/d of 
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).
•
Average consumption of nuts, legumes, and seeds was ≈2 servings per week 
among black women, black men, and white women; 3 servings per week among 
white men; and 6 and 8 servings per week among Mexican American women and 
men, respectively. Approximately 18% of whites, 14% to 17% of blacks, and 36% 
to 46% of Mexican Americans consumed ≥4 servings per week.

•
Average consumption of processed meats was lowest among Mexican American 
women (1.5 servings per week) and highest among black men (3.7 servings per 
week). Between 40% (Mexican American women) and 68% (black men) of adults 
consumed ≥1 serving per week.
•
Average consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages ranged from ≈6 servings per 
week among white women to 18 servings per week among Mexican American 
men. Approximately 51% and 32% of white men and women, 76% and 66% of 
black men and women, and 78% and 61% of Mexican American men and women, 
respectively, consumed >36 oz (4.5 eight-oz servings) per week.
•
Average consumption of sweets and bakery desserts ranged from ≈4 servings per 
day (Mexican American men) to 8 servings per day (white men). Approximately 
two thirds of white and black men and women and half of all Mexican American 
men and women consumed >25 servings per week.
•
Between 33% and 54% of adults in each sex and ethnic subgroup consumed <10% 
of total calories from saturated fat, and between 59% and 69% consumed <300 mg 
of dietary cholesterol per day.
•
Only 3% to 7% of whites, 2% to 3% of blacks, and 11% to 12% of Mexican 
Americans consumed ≥28 g of dietary fiber per day.
•
Only 7% to 13% of whites, 9% to 10% of blacks, and 17% to 24% of Mexican 
Americans consumed <2.3 g of sodium per day. In 2005, the US Department of 
Health and Human Services (DHHS) and US Department of Agriculture (USDA) 
recommended that adults in specific groups, including people with hypertension, all 
middle-aged and older adults, and all blacks, should consume no more than 1.5 g of 
sodium per day. Overall in 2005 to 2006, the majority (69.2%) of US adults 
belonged to 1 or more of these specific groups in whom sodium consumption 
should be 1.5 g/d.1
Foods and Nutrients: Children and Teenagers—See Table 19-2; NHANES 2005 to 
2006; personal communication with D. Mozaffarian (December 2008).
The dietary consumption by US children and teenagers of selected foods and nutrients 
related to cardiometabolic health is detailed in Table 19-2:
•
Average whole grain consumption was low, ranging from 0.4 to 0.5 servings per 
day, with 4% of children in different age and sex subgroups consuming ≥3 servings 
per day.
•
Average fruit consumption was low: 1.5 and 1.3 servings per day in younger boys 
and girls (5 to 9 years of age), 1.3 servings per day in adolescent boys and girls (10 
to 14 years of age), and 0.8 servings per day in teenage boys and girls (15 to 19 
years of age). The proportion consuming ≥4 servings per day was low and 
decreased with age: 6% in those 5 to 9 years of age, 6% to 8% in those 10 to 14 
years of age, and 3% to 4% in those 15 to 19 years of age. When 100% fruit juices 
were included, the number of servings consumed approximately doubled or tripled,

and proportions consuming ≥4 servings per day were 18% to 19% of those 5 to 9 
years of age, 16% of those 10 to 14 years of age, and 10% to 14% of those 15 to 19 
years of age.
•
Average vegetable consumption was low, ranging from 0.8 to 0.9 servings per day, 
with only up to 2% of children in different age and sex subgroups consuming ≥5 
servings per day.
•
Average consumption of fish and shellfish was low, ranging between 0.6 and 0.8 
servings per week in 5- to 9-year-olds, 0.4 to 1.1 servings per week in 10- to 14-
year-olds, and 0.6 to 0.7 servings per week in 15- to 19-year-olds. Among all ages, 
15% of children and teenagers consumed ≥2 servings per week.
•
Average consumption of nuts, legumes, and seeds ranged from 1.0 to 1.2 servings 
per week among 15- to 19-year-olds to 1.4 to 1.7 servings per week at younger 
ages. Between 9% and 13% of children in different age and sex subgroups 
consumed ≥4 servings per week.
•
Average consumption of processed meats ranged from 2.1 to 3.4 servings per 
week; was uniformly higher than the average consumption of nuts, legumes, and 
seeds; and was up to 6 times higher than the average consumption of fish and 
shellfish. Between 42% and 60% of children consumed ≥2 servings per week.
•
Average consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages was higher in boys than in 
girls and was ≈8 servings per week in 5- to 9-year-olds, 11 to 14 servings per week 
in 10- to 14-year-olds, and 15 to 23 servings per week in 15- to 19-year-olds. This 
was generally considerably higher than the average consumption of whole grains, 
fruits, vegetables, fish and shellfish, or nuts, legumes, and seeds. Only between 
13% (boys 15 to 19 years of age) and 40% (boys and girls 5 to 9 years of age) of 
children consumed 4.5 servings per week.
•
Average consumption of sweets and bakery desserts was ≈10 servings per week in 
5- to 9-year-olds and 10- to 14-year-olds and 6 to 9 servings per week in 15- to 19-
year-olds. From 82% (5 to 9 years of age) to 59% (15 to 19 years of age) of youths 
consumed >2.5 servings per week.
•
Average consumption of EPA and DHA was low, ranging from ≈40 to 80 mg/d in 
boys and girls at all ages. Only between 0.4% and 2.5% of children and teenagers 
at all ages consumed ≥500 mg/d.
•
Average consumption of saturated fat was between 11% and 12% of calories, and 
average consumption of dietary cholesterol was ≈230 mg/d. Approximately one 
fifth to one third of children consumed <10% energy from saturated fat, and ≈80% 
consumed <300 mg of dietary cholesterol per day.
•
Average consumption of dietary fiber ranged from 11 to 14 g/d. Less than 2% of 
children in different age and sex subgroups consumed ≥28 g/d.
•
Average consumption of sodium ranged from 3.0 to 3.4 g/d. Between 6% and 12% 
of children in different age and sex subgroups consumed <2.3 g/d.

Energy Balance—Energy balance, or consumption of total calories appropriate for needs, 
is determined by the balance of average calories consumed versus expended, with this 
balance depending on multiple factors, including calories consumed, PA, body size, age, 
sex, and underlying basal metabolic rate. Thus, one individual may consume relatively high 
calories but have negative energy balance (as a result of even greater calories expended), 
whereas another individual may consume relatively few calories but have positive energy 
balance (because of low calories expended). Given such variation, the most practical and 
reasonable method to assess energy balance in populations is to assess changes in weight 
over time (see the Trends section below).
•
Average daily caloric intake in the United States is ≈2500 calories in adult men 
and 1800 calories in adult women (Table 19-1). In children and teenagers, average 
caloric intake is higher in boys than in girls and increases with age in boys (Table 
19-2). Trends in energy balance are described below.
•
Individual nutritional determinants of positive energy balance (more calories 
consumed than expended), as determined by adiposity or weight gain, include 
larger portion sizes,2,3 higher intake of sugar-sweetened beverages,4,5 and greater 
consumption of fast food and commercially prepared meals.6–10
•
Each of these dietary factors has multiple influences; for example, preferences for 
portion size are associated with BMI, socioeconomic status, eating in fast food 
restaurants, and television watching.11,12 Portion sizes are larger at fast food 
restaurants than at home or at other restaurants.13
•
In 1999 to 2000, 41% of US adults consumed ≥3 commercially prepared meals per 
week.7 Between 1999 and 2004, 53% of Americans consumed an average of 1 to 3 
restaurant meals per week, and 23% consumed ≥4 restaurant meals per week.14 
Spending on food away from home, including restaurant meals, catered foods, and 
food eaten during out-of-town trips, increased from 26% of average annual food 
expenditures in 1970% to 42% in 2004.14
•
Macronutrient composition of the diet such as percent calories from total fat or total 
carbohydrate does not appear to be strongly associated with energy balance as 
ascertained by weight gain or loss.15–17 Preliminary evidence suggests that aspects 
of dietary quality rather than composition such as extent of processing of 
carbohydrates consumed,17 consumption of trans fat,18–20 and energy density21–23 
may be associated with energy imbalance as assessed by changes in adiposity or 
weight, but such data are still emerging. Randomized controlled trials in obese 
individuals generally show modestly greater weight loss with low-carbohydrate 
versus low-fat diets at 6 months, but at 1 year, such differences diminish, and a diet 
that focuses on dietary quality and whole foods may be most successful.24–26
•
A comparison of BRFSS data in 1996 and 2003 suggested a shift in self-reported 
dietary strategies to lose weight, with the proportion focusing on energy restriction 
increasing from 11.3% to 24.9%, and the proportion focusing on restricting fat 
consumption decreasing from 41.6% to 29.1%.27

•
Other individual factors associated with positive energy balance (weight gain) 
include greater television watching (particularly as related to greater food 
consumption)28–33 and lower average sleep duration, particularly among 
children.34
•
A 2007 to 2008 national survey of 1082 retail stores in 19 US cities found that 
energy-dense snack foods/beverages were present in 96% of pharmacies, 94% of 
gas stations, 22% of furniture stores, 16% of apparel stores, and 29% to 65% of 
other types of stores.35
•
Societal and environmental factors independently associated with energy imbalance 
(weight gain), via either increased caloric consumption or decreased expenditure, 
include education, income, race/ethnicity, and local conditions such as availability 
of grocery stores, types of restaurants, safety, parks and open spaces, and walking 
or biking paths.36–38 PA is covered in a separate chapter of this update.
Dietary Patterns
In addition to individual foods and nutrients, overall dietary patterns can be used to assess 
more global dietary quality. Different dietary patterns have been defined, including the 
Healthy Eating Index (HEI), Alternative Health Eating Index, Western versus prudent 
dietary patterns, Mediterranean dietary pattern, and DASH-type diet.
•
In 1999 to 2004, only 19.4% of hypertensive US adults were following a DASH-
type diet (based on intake of fiber, magnesium, calcium, sodium, potassium, 
protein, total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol). This represented a decrease from 
26.7% of hypertensive US adults in 1988 to 1994.39
•
Among older US adults (≥60 years of age) in 1999 to 2002, 72% met guidelines for 
dietary cholesterol intake, but only between 18% and 32% met guidelines for the 
HEI food groups (meats, dairy, fruits, vegetables, and grains). On the basis of the 
HEI score, only 17% of older US adults consumed a good-quality diet. Higher HEI 
scores were seen in white adults and individuals with greater education; lower HEI 
scores were seen in black adults and smokers.40
•
Nearly 75 000 women 38 to 63 years of age in the Nurses’ Health Study without a 
history of CVD or DM were followed up from 1984 to 2004. It was found that a 
greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher Alternate 
Mediterranean Diet Score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and 
stroke in women.41
Dietary Supplements
Use of dietary supplements is common in the United States among both adults and children:
•
Half (53%) of US adults in 2001 to 2004 used dietary supplements, with the most 
common supplement being multivitamins and multiminerals (67% of supplement 
users). Most supplements were taken daily and for at least 2 years. Supplement use 
was associated with older age, higher education, greater PA, wine intake, lower 
BMI, and white race.14,42

•
One third (32%) of US children (birth to 18 years of age) used dietary supplements 
in 1999 to 2002, with the highest use (48.5%) occurring among 4- to 8-year-olds. 
The most common supplements were multivitamins and multiminerals (58% of 
supplement users). The primary nutrients supplemented (either by multivitamins 
and/or individual vitamins) included vitamin C (29% of US children), vitamin A 
(26%), vitamin D (26%), calcium (21%), and iron (19%). Supplement use was 
associated with higher family income, a smoke-free home environment, lower child 
BMI, and less screen time (television, video games, or computers).43
•
In a 2005 to 2006 telephone survey of US adults, 41.3% were making or had made 
in the past a serious weight-loss attempt. Of these, one third (33.9%) had used a 
dietary supplement for weight loss, with such use being more common in women 
(44.9%) than in men (19.8%) and in blacks (48.7%) or Hispanics (41.6%) than in 
whites (31.2%); in those with high school education or less (38.4%) than in those 
with some college or more (31.1%); and in those with household income less than 
$40 000 per year (41.8%) than in those with higher incomes (30.3%).44
•
Multiple trials of most dietary supplements, including folate, vitamin C, and 
vitamin E, have generally shown no significant effect on CVD risk. The major 
exceptions are long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, for which 3 large randomized 
controlled trials that included populations with and without established HD have 
shown significant reductions in risk of CVD events at doses of 1 to 2 g/d (Gruppo 
Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell’Infarto miocardico [GISSI]-
Prevenzione, Japan EPA Lipid Intervention Study, and GISSI-HF).45–47 Another 
multicenter randomized trial conducted in a population with diabetic nephropathy 
found that B vitamin supplementation containing folic acid (2.5 mg/d), vitamin B6 
(25 mg), and vitamin B12 (1 mg/d) resulted in a greater decrease in glomerular 
filtration rate and an increase in myocardial infarction and stroke compared with 
placebo.48
Trends
Energy Balance—Energy balance, or consumption of total calories appropriate for needs, 
has been steadily worsening in the United States over the past several decades, as evidenced 
by the dramatic increases in overweight and obesity among both children and adults across 
broad cross sections of sex, race/ethnicity, geographic residence, and socioeconomic 
status.49,50
•
Although trends in total calories consumed are difficult to quantify exactly because 
of differing methods of serial national dietary surveys over time, multiple lines of 
evidence indicate that average total energy consumption has increased by at least 
200 kcal/d per person in the past 3 decades.
•
Data from NHANES indicate that between 1971 and 2004, average total energy 
consumption among US adults increased by 22% in women (from 1542 to 1886 
kcal/d) and by 10% in men (from 2450 to 2693 kcal/d; Chart 19-1). These increases 
are supported by data from the Nationwide Food Consumption Survey (1977–
1978) and the Continuing Surveys of Food Intake (1989 –1998).13

•
The increases in calories consumed during this time period are attributable 
primarily to greater average carbohydrate intake, particularly of starches, refined 
grains, and sugars (see the Foods and Nutrients section below). Other specific 
changes related to increased caloric intake in the United States include larger 
portion sizes, greater food quantity and calories per meal, and increased 
consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, snacks, commercially prepared 
(especially fast food) meals, and higher-energy-density foods.7,13,51–55
•
Between 1977 to 1978 and 1994 to 1996, the average portion sizes for nearly all 
foods increased at fast food outlets, other restaurants, and home. These included a 
33% increase in the average portion of Mexican food (from 408 to 541 calories), a 
34% increase in the average portion of cheeseburgers (from 397 to 533 calories), a 
36% increase in the average portion of French fries (from 188 to 256 calories), and 
a 70% increase in the average portion of salty snacks such as crackers, potato chips, 
pretzels, puffed rice cakes, and popcorn (from 132 to 225 calories).13
•
Among US children 2 to 7 years of age, an estimated energy imbalance of only 110 
to 165 kcal/d (the equivalent of one 12- to 16-oz bottle of soda/cola) was sufficient 
to account for the excess weight gain between 1988 to 1994 and 1999 to 2002.56
Foods and Nutrients—Several changes in foods and nutrients have occurred over time. 
Selected changes are highlighted:
Macronutrients
•
Starting in 1977 and continuing until the most recent dietary guidelines revision in 
2005, a major focus of US dietary guidelines was reduction of total dietary fat.55 
During this time, average total fat consumption declined as a percent of calories 
from 36.9% to 33.4% in men and from 36.1% to 33.8% in women (Chart 19-1).
•
Dietary guidelines during this time also emphasized carbohydrate consumption (eg, 
as the base of the Food Guide Pyramid),57 which increased from 42.4% to 48.2% of 
calories in men and from 45.4% to 50.6% of calories in women (Chart 19-1). 
Evaluated as absolute intakes, the increase in total calories consumed during this 
period was attributable primarily to the greater consumption of carbohydrates, both 
as foods (starches and grains) and as beverages.58,59
Sugar-Sweetened Beverages
•
Between 1965 and 2002, the average percentage of total calories consumed from 
beverages in the United States increased from 11.8% to 21.0% of energy, which 
represents an overall absolute increase of 222 cal/d per person.54 This increase was 
due largely to increased consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and alcohol: 
Average consumption of fruit juices went from 20 to 39 kcal/d; of milk, from 125 
to 94 kcal/d; of alcohol, from 26 to 99 kcal/d; of sweetened fruit drinks, from 13 to 
38 kcal/d; and of soda/cola, from 35 to 143 kcal/d (Chart 19-2).

•
In addition to increased overall consumption, the average portion size of a single 
sugar-sweetened beverage increased by >50% between 1977 and 1996, from 13.1 
to 19.9 fl oz.13
•
Among children and teenagers (2 to 19 years of age), the largest increases in 
consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages between 1988 to 1994 and 1999 to 
2004 were seen among black and Mexican American youths compared with white 
youths.55
Fruits and Vegetables
•
Between 1994 and 2005, the average consumption of fruits and vegetables declined 
slightly, from a total of 3.4 to 3.2 servings per day. The proportions of men and 
women consuming combined fruits and vegetables ≥5 times per day were low 
(≈20% and 29%, respectively) and did not change during this period.60
Morbidity and Mortality
Effects on Cardiovascular Risk Factors—In randomized controlled trials, dietary 
habits affect multiple cardiovascular risk factors, including both established risk factors 
(SBP, DBP, LDL cholesterol levels, HDL cholesterol levels, glucose levels, and obesity/
weight gain) and novel risk factors (eg, inflammation, cardiac arrhythmias, endothelial cell 
function, triglyceride levels, lipoprotein(a) levels, and heart rate):
•
A DASH dietary pattern with low sodium reduced SBP by 7.1 mm Hg in adults 
without hypertension and by 11.5 mm Hg in adults with hypertension.61
•
Compared with the low-fat DASH diet, DASH-type diets that increased 
consumption of either protein or unsaturated fat had similar or greater beneficial 
effects on CVD risk factors. Compared with a baseline usual diet, each of the 
DASH-type diets, which included various percentages (27% to 37%) of total fat 
and focused on whole foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fish, as 
well as potassium and other minerals and low sodium, reduced SBP by 8 to 10 mm 
Hg, DBP by 4 to 5 mm Hg, and LDL cholesterol by 12 to 14 mg/dL. The diets that 
had higher levels of protein and unsaturated fat also lowered triglyceride levels by 
16 and 9 mg/dL, respectively.62
•
In a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, consumption of 1% of calories 
from trans fat in place of saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, or polyunsaturated fat 
increased the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol by 0.031, 0.054, and 0.67; increased 
apolipoprotein (apo) B levels by 3, 10, and 11 mg/L; decreased apoA-1 levels by 7, 
5, and 3 mg/L; and increased lipoprotein(a) levels by 3.8, 1.4, and 1.1 mg/L, 
respectively.63
•
In meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials, consumption of EPA and DHA 
for ≥12 weeks lowered SBP by 2.1 mm Hg64 and resting heart rate by 2.5 bpm.65
•
A review of cross-sectional and prospective cohort studies suggests that higher 
intake of sugar-sweetened beverages is associated with greater visceral fat and 
higher risk of type 2 DM.66 In the PREMIER study, a prospective analysis of the

810 participants indicated that a reduction in sugar-sweetened beverages of 1 
serving per day was associated with a reduction in SBP of 1.8 mm Hg (95% CI, 1.2 
to 2.4) and in DBP of 1.1 mm Hg (95% CI, 0.7 to 1.4).67
•
In a randomized controlled trial, compared with a low-fat diet, 2 Mediterranean 
dietary patterns that included either virgin olive oil or mixed nuts lowered SBP by 
5.9 and 7.1 mm Hg, plasma glucose by 7.0 and 5.4 mg/dL, fasting insulin by 16.7 
and 20.4 pmol/L, the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index by 0.9 and 1.1, 
and the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol by 0.38 and 0.26 and raised HDL 
cholesterol by 2.9 and 1.6 mg/dL, respectively. The Mediterranean dietary patterns 
also lowered levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, intercellular adhesion 
molecule-1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1.68
Effects on Cardiovascular Outcomes—Because dietary habits affect a broad range of 
established and novel risk factors, estimation of the impact of nutritional factors on 
cardiovascular health by considering only a limited number of pathways (eg, only effects on 
lipids, BP, and obesity) will systematically underestimate or even misconstrue the actual 
total impact on health. Randomized controlled trials and prospective observational studies 
can better quantify the total effects of dietary habits on clinical outcomes:
•
In the WHI randomized clinical trial, n = 48 835), reduction of total fat 
consumption from 37.8% energy (baseline) to 24.3% energy (at 1 year) and 28.8% 
energy (at 6 years) had no effect on incidence of CHD (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.88 to 
1.09), stroke (RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.90 to 1.15), or total CVD (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 
0.92 to 1.05) over a mean of 8.1 years.69 This was consistent with null results of 4 
prior randomized clinical trials (see below) and multiple large prospective cohort 
studies (see below) that indicated little effect of total fat consumption on risk of 
CVD.70–79
•
In 3 separate meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies, the largest including 21 
studies with up to 2 decades of follow-up, saturated fat consumption overall had no 
significant association with incidence of CHD, stroke, or total CVD.80–82 However, 
in a pooled individual-level analysis of 11 prospective cohort studies, the specific 
exchange of polyunsaturated fat consumption in place of saturated fat was 
associated with lower CHD risk, with 13% lower risk for a 5% energy exchange 
(RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.97).83 These findings are consistent with a meta-
analysis of randomized controlled trials in which increased polyunsaturated fat 
consumption in place of saturated fat reduced CHD risk, with 10% lower risk for a 
5% energy exchange (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.83 to 0.97).84
•
In a pooled analysis of individual-level data from 11 prospective cohort studies in 
the United States, Europe, and Israel that included 344 696 participants, each 5% 
energy of carbohydrate consumption in place of saturated fat was associated with a 
7% higher risk of CHD (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.14).83 Each 5% energy of 
monounsaturated fat consumption in place of saturated fat was not significantly 
associated with CHD risk.83

•
In a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies, each 2% of calories from trans fat 
was associated with a 23% higher risk of CHD (RR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.37).85
•
In meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies, each daily serving of fruits or 
vegetables was associated with a 4% lower risk of CHD (RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93 to 
0.99) and a 5% lower risk of stroke (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.92 to 0.97).86,87
•
In a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies, greater whole grain intake (2.5 
compared with 0.2 servings per day) was associated with a 21% lower risk of CVD 
events (RR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.73 to 0.85), with similar estimates for specific CVD 
outcomes (HD, stroke, fatal CVD) and in sex-specific analyses. In contrast, refined 
grain intake was not associated with lower risk of CVD (RR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.94 to 
1.22).88
•
In a meta-analysis of 16 prospective cohort studies including 326 572 generally 
healthy individuals in Europe, the United States, China, and Japan, fish 
consumption was associated with significantly lower risk of CHD mortality.89 
Compared with no consumption, an estimated 250 mg/d of long-chain omega-3 
fatty acids was associated with 35% lower risk of CHD death (P<0.001).
•
Higher estimated consumption of dietary sodium was not associated with lower 
CVD mortality in NHANES,90 although such findings may be limited by changes 
in behaviors that result from underlying risk (reverse causation). In a posthoc 
analysis of the Trials of Hypertension Prevention, participants randomized to low-
sodium interventions had a 25% lower risk of CVD (RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.57 to 
0.99) after 10 to 15 years of follow-up after the original trials.91
•
Among 88 520 generally healthy women in the Nurses’ Health Study who were 34 
to 59 years of age in 1980 and were followed up from 1980 to 2004, regular 
consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages was independently associated with 
higher incidence of CHD, with 23% and 35% higher risk with 1 and ≥2 servings 
per day, respectively, compared with <1 per month.92 Among the 15 745 
participants in Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, the odds ratio for 
developing chronic kidney disease was 2.59 for participants who had a serum uric 
acid level >9.0 mg/dL and who drank >1 sugar-sweetened soda per day.93
•
In a cohort of 380 296 US men and women, greater versus lower adherence to a 
Mediterranean dietary pattern, characterized by higher intakes of vegetables, 
legumes, nuts, fruits, whole grains, fish, and unsaturated fat and lower intakes of 
red and processed meat, was associated with a 22% lower cardiovascular mortality 
(RR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.69 to 0.87).94 In a cohort of 72 113 US female nurses, a 
dietary pattern characterized by higher intakes of vegetables, fruits, legumes, fish, 
poultry, and whole grains was associated with a 28% lower cardiovascular 
mortality (RR, 0.72; 95% C,I 0.60 to 0.87), whereas a dietary pattern characterized 
by higher intakes of processed meat, red meat, refined grains, French fries, and 
sweets/desserts was associated with a 22% higher cardiovascular mortality (RR, 
1.22; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.48).95 Similar findings have been seen in other cohorts and 
for other outcomes, including development of DM and metabolic syndrome.96–100

In one report that used consistent and comparable risk assessment methods and 
nationally representative data, the mortality effects in the United States of 12 
modifiable dietary, lifestyle, and metabolic risk factors were assessed. High dietary 
salt consumption was estimated to be responsible for 102 000 annual deaths, low 
dietary omega-3 fatty acids for 84 000 annual deaths, high dietary trans fatty acids 
for 82 000 annual deaths, and low consumption of fruits and vegetables for 55 000 
annual deaths.101
Cost
The USDA forecast that the Consumer Price Index for all food would increase 4.5% to 5.5% 
in 2008 as retailers continued to pass on higher commodity and energy costs to consumers in 
the form of higher retail prices. The Consumer Price Index for food increased 4.0% in 2007, 
the highest annual increase since 1990. Prices for foods eaten at home increased 4.2% in 
2007, whereas prices for foods eaten away from home increased by 3.6%.55
•
The proportion of total US food expenditures for meals outside the home, as a share 
of total food dollars, increased from 25% in 1957 to 38% in 1977 to 49% in 200757 
(Chart 19-3).
•
The proportion of sales of meals and snacks from fast food restaurants compared 
with total meals and snacks away from home increased from 5% in 1958 to 28% in 
1977 to 37% in 2007.102
•
As a proportion of income, food has become less expensive over time in the United 
States. As a share of personal disposable income, average (mean) total food 
expenditures by families and individuals have decreased from 23.5% (1947) to 
18.4% (1957) to 13.4% (1977) to 9.8% (2007). For any given year, the share of 
disposable income spent on food is inversely proportional to absolute income; the 
share increases as absolute income levels decline.102
•
Among 154 forms of fruits and vegetables priced with ACNielsen Homescan data, 
more than half were estimated to cost 25 cents per serving. Consumers could meet 
a recommendation of 3 servings of fruits and 4 servings of vegetables daily for a 
total cost of 64 cents per day.102
•
An overview of the costs of various strategies for primary prevention of CVD 
determined that the estimated costs per year of life gained were between $9800 and 
$18 000 for statin therapy, $1500 or more for nurse screening and lifestyle advice, 
$500 to $1250 for smoking cessation, and $20 to $900 for population-based healthy 
eating.103
•
Each year, more than $33 billion in medical costs and $9 billion in lost productivity 
resulting from HD, cancer, stroke, and DM are attributed to poor nutrition.104–109

20. Quality of Care
See Tables 20-1 through 20-11.
The Institute of Medicine (IOM) defines quality of care as “the degree to which health 
services for individuals and populations increase the likelihood of desired health outcomes 
and are consistent with current professional knowledge.”1 The IOM has defined 6 specific 
domains for improving health care, including care that is safe, effective, patient-centered, 
timely, efficient, and equitable.
In the following sections, data on quality of care will be presented based on the 6 domains of 
quality as defined by the IOM. This is intended to highlight current care and to stimulate 
efforts to improve the quality of cardiovascular care nationally. Where possible, data are 
reported from recently published literature or standardized quality indicators from quality 
improvement registries (ie, those consistent with the methods for quality performance 
measures endorsed by the ACC and the AHA).2 Additional data on aspects of quality of 
care, such as adherence to ACC/AHA clinical practice guidelines, are also included to 
provide a spectrum of quality-of care data. The data selected are meant to provide examples 
of the current quality of care as reflected by the IOM domain and are not meant to be 
comprehensive given the sheer number of publications yearly.
•
The safety domain has been defined as avoiding injuries to patients from the care 
that is intended to help them. The following are several publications that have 
focused on safety issues:
—
In a small, single-center study conducted over a 2-month period in the 
cardiac care unit (CCU) of a tertiary center, Rahim et al1 demonstrated 
that iatrogenic adverse events were common (99 of 194 patients), of 
which bleeding (27%) was the most common preventable iatrogenic 
adverse event.
—
Using the National Cardiovascular Data Registry CathPCI registry, Tsai 
et al2 found that almost one fourth of dialysis patients undergoing PCI 
(n=22 778) received a contraindicated antithrombotic agent, specifically 
enoxaparin, eptifibatide, or both. Patients who received a contraindicated 
antithrombotic agent had an increased risk of in-hospital bleeding (OR 
1.63, 95% CI 1.35 to 1.98) and a trend toward increased mortality (OR 
1.15, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.36).2
—
In a random sample of medical and surgical long-term care adult patients 
in Massachusetts hospitals, López et al3 assessed the association between 
disclosure of an adverse event and patients’ perception of quality of care. 
Overall, only 40% of adverse events were disclosed. Higher quality 
ratings were associated with disclosure of an adverse event. Conversely, 
lower patient perception of quality of care was associated with events that 
were preventable and with events that caused discomfort.3

The AHA published a scientific statement4 about medication errors in 
acute cardiovascular and stroke patients and classified medication errors 
into the following categories:
◦
Improper dosing or timing, or delivery of an incorrect or 
unnecessary medication.
◦
Administration to the wrong patient (errors of omission).
◦
Failure to prescribe appropriate medication therapy or needed 
monitoring of medication therapy (errors of omission).
—
The following recommendations were made to improve medication safety 
in long-term cardiovascular care:
◦
An accurate patient weight should be obtained on admission.
◦
Estimated creatinine clearance should be calculated with the 
Cockcroft-Gault formula on admission and as changes in 
creatinine occur.
◦
Medication dosage adjustments and heightened surveillance for 
adverse medication events are recommend owing to age-related 
changes in pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and renal 
function.
◦
Order forms and protocols for anticoagulation should be 
standardized.
◦
Pharmacists and nurses should be integrated within the 
cardiovascular care teams in the ED, intensive care unit (ICU), 
CCU, and inpatient wards to enhance communication and 
medication safety.
◦
Computerized order entry, medication bar-coding technology, 
and smart infusion pumps should be implemented throughout 
all inpatient wards, including the ED.
◦
Staff should be educated about high-alert medication, safe 
medication administration techniques, medication reconciliation 
procedures, and automated dispensing-device technologies.
◦
An organizational culture of safety should be cultivated that 
promotes no-fault internal and external medication error 
reporting and an interdisciplinary quality improvement review 
process to reduce the frequency and impact of medication 
errors.4
•
Effective care has been defined as providing services based on scientific knowledge 
to all who could benefit and refraining from providing services to those not likely 
to benefit. There are many quality improvement registries that have been developed 
for inpatient cardiovascular/stroke care, and the data on these are provided in 
Roger et al.

subsequent tables. Similar efforts are under way for quality-of-care registries in the 
outpatient setting.
—
In the CRUSADE registry, >7% of patients with STEMI without a 
reperfusion contraindication did not have reperfusion therapy 
administered, and this was associated with greater in-hospital mortality. 
One in 10 patients (10.3%) had a documented contraindication to 
reperfusion. Primary reasons for contraindications were identified as 
absence of an ischemic indication (53.8%), bleeding risk (16.7%), 
patient-related reasons (25.3%), and other (4.2%).5

According to data from NHANES 1988–1994 and 1999–2008, rates of 
hypertension have increased from 23.9% in 1988–1994 to 29.0% between 
2007 and 2008, and hypertension control has increased from 27.3% in 
1988–1994 to 50.1% in 2007–2008. In addition, among patients with 
hypertension, BP has decreased from 143.0/80.4 to 135.2/74.1 mm Hg.6

The National Quality Forum (NQF) is a nonprofit organization that aims 
to improve the quality of healthcare for all Americans through fulfillment 
of its 3-part mission: (1) Setting national priorities and goals for 
performance improvement; (2) endorsing national consensus standards 
for measuring and publicly reporting on performance; and (3) promoting 
the attainment of national goals through education and outreach 
programs. Recognizing that adherence can impact the effectiveness of 
therapies, NQF has adopted several performance measures related to 
medication adherence/ persistence, including angiotensin-converting 
enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) use and 
persistence among patients with CAD who are at high risk for coronary 
events, persistence of β-blocker treatment after a heart attack for patients 
with AMI, and adherence to lipid-lowering medication.7
—
Inpatient ACS, HF, and stroke quality-of-care measures data, including 
trends in care data, where available from national registries, are given in 
Tables 20-1 to 20-6.

Selected outpatient quality-of-care measures from the National 
Committee for Quality Assurance for 2009 appear in Table 20-7.
•
Patient-centered care has been defined as the provision of care that is respectful of 
and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values and that ensures 
that patient values guide all clinical decisions. Dimensions of patient-centered care 
include the following: (1) Respect for patients’ values, preferences, and expressed 
needs; (2) coordination and integration of care; (3) information, communication, 
and education; (4) physical comfort; (5) emotional support; and (6) involvement of 
family and friends. Studies focusing on some of these aspects of patient-centered 
care are highlighted below:

optimal medical therapy versus optimal medical therapy alone, 
demonstrated that both groups had significant improvement in health 
status during follow-up. By 3 months, health status scores had increased 
in the PCI group compared with the medical therapy group to 76±24 
versus 72±23 for physical limitation (P=0.004), 77±28 versus 73±27 for 
angina stability (P=0.002), 85±22 versus 80±23 for angina frequency 
(P<0.001), 92±12 versus 90±14 for treatment satisfaction (P<0.001), and 
73±22 versus 68±23 for quality of life (P<0.001). The PCI plus optimal 
medical therapy group had a small but significant incremental benefit 
compared with the optimal medical therapy group early on, but this 
benefit disappeared by 36 months.
—
In the Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial (SCD-HeFT)9 of 
single-lead ICD versus amiodarone for moderately symptomatic HF, 
patients with ICDs had improvement in quality of life compared with 
medical therapy patients at 3 and 12 months but not at 30 months. ICD 
shocks in the month preceding a scheduled assessment were associated 
with a decrease in quality of life in multiple domains. The authors 
concluded that the presence of a single-lead ICD was not associated with 
any detectably adverse quality of life during 30 months of follow-up.
—
Peikes et al10 reported on 15 care-coordination programs as a part of a 
Medicare demonstration project for patients with coronary HF, CAD, and 
DM. Thirteen of the 15 programs did not show a difference in 
hospitalization rates, and none of the programs demonstrated a net 
savings. The interventions tested varied significantly, but the majority of 
the interventions included patient education to improve adherence to 
medication, diet, exercise, and self-care regimens and improving care 
coordination through various approaches. These programs overall had 
favorable effects on none of the adherence measures and only a few of the 
many quality-of-care indicators examined. The authors concluded that 
programs with substantial in-person contact that target moderately to 
severely ill patients can be cost-neutral and improve some aspects of care.
—
Hernandez et al11 showed that patients with outpatient follow-up within 7 
days of discharge for an HF hospitalization were less likely to be 
readmitted within 30 days in the Get With The Guidelines (GWTG)-HF 
registry of patients who were ≥65 years of age. The median length of stay 
was 4 days (interquartile range, 2 to 6 days), and 21.3% of patients were 
readmitted within 30 days. At the hospital level, the median percentage of 
patients who had early follow-up after discharge from the index 
hospitalization was 38.3% (interquartile range, 32.4% to 44.5%).
—
Smolderen et al12 assessed whether health insurance status affects 
decisions to seek care for AMI. Uninsured and insured patients with 
financial concerns were more likely to delay seeking care during AMI 
and had prehospital delays of more than 6 hours (48.6% of uninsured

patients and 44.6% of insured patients with financial concerns compared 
with only 39.3% of insured patients without financial concerns). Lack of 
health insurance and financial concerns about accessing care among those 
with health insurance were each associated with delays in seeking 
emergency care for AMI.
—
Using a cohort (n=192) nested within a randomized trial at a university-
affiliated ambulatory practice, Murray et al13 demonstrated that refill 
adherence of <40% was associated with a 3-fold higher incidence of 
hospitalization for HF than a refill adherence of ≥80% (P=0.002). In 
multivariable analysis, prescription label–reading skills were associated 
with a lower incidence of HF-specific emergency care (incidence rate 
ratio 0.76, 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.69), and participants with adequate health 
literacy had a lower risk of hospitalization for HF (incidence rate ratio 
0.34, 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.76).
•
The timely care domain relates to reducing waits and sometimes harmful delays for 
both those who receive and those who give care. Timeliness is an important 
characteristic of any service and is a legitimate and valued focus of improvement in 
healthcare and other industries.
—
Chan et al14 demonstrated significant variation in timely defibrillation 
(<2 minutes) for in-hospital cardiac arrest among 200 hospitals 
participating in the National Registry of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation 
(NRCPR). Adjusted rates of delayed defibrillation varied from 2.4% to 
50.9% of in-hospital cardiac arrests. The variations in defibrillation rates 
were largely unexplained by traditional hospital factors.
—
Bradley et al15 demonstrated that participation in the Door-to-Balloon 
(D2B) Alliance led to a reduction in D2B time to within 90 minutes for 
patients with STEMI. By March 2008, >75% of patients had D2B times 
of ≤90 minutes compared with only approximately one fourth of patients 
in April 2005.
—
From data submitted to GWTG-Resuscitation in 2009:
◦
Among children who experienced in-hospital cardiac arrests 
with an initial shockable rhythm, 74% received a defibrillation 
attempt within 3 minutes.
◦
Among adults in similar situations, 80% received a 
defibrillation attempt within 3 minutes.
—
Thirty-one percent of adults treated for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest 
received bystander CPR.16

Efficiency has been defined as avoiding waste, in particular waste of equipment, 
supplies, ideas, and energy. In an efficient healthcare system, resources are used to 
get the best value for the money spent.
—
The AHA and ACC have jointly developed a scientific statement that 
outlines standards for measures to be used for public reporting of 
efficiency in health care. The group identified 4 standards important to 
the development of any efficiency performance measure, including (1) 
integration of quality and cost, (2) valid cost measurement and analysis, 
(3) no or minimal incentive to provide poor-quality care, and (4) no or 
proper attribution of the measure. In the statement, 4 examples were 
provided of hospital-based efficiency measures, as well as information on 
how each of the measures fared within the 4 domains recommended. The 
examples were length of stay, 30-day readmission, hospitalization costs, 
and nonrecommended imaging tests.
—
At an urban, tertiary-care, academic medical center ED, elements of 
departmental work flow were redesigned to streamline patient throughput 
before implementation of a fully integrated ED information system with 
patient tracking, computerized charting and order entry, and direct access 
to patient historical data from the hospital data repository. Increasing the 
clinical information available at the bedside and improving departmental 
work flow through ED information system implementation and process 
redesign led to decreased patient throughput times and improved ED 
efficiency (eg, the length of stay for all patients [from arrival to time 
patient left ED] decreased by 1.94 hours, from 6.69 [n=508] before the 
intervention to 4.75 [n=691] after the intervention; P<0.001).17
—
Himmelstein et al18 analyzed whether more-computerized hospitals had 
lower costs of care or administration or better quality to address a 
common belief that computerization improves healthcare quality, reduces 
costs, and increases administrative efficiency. They found that hospitals 
that increased computerization faster had more rapid administrative cost 
increases (P=0.0001); however, higher overall computerization scores 
correlated weakly with better quality scores for AMI (r=0.07, P=0.003) 
but not for HF, pneumonia, or the 3 conditions combined. In multivariate 
analyses, more-computerized hospitals had slightly better quality. The 
authors concluded that hospital computing might modestly improve 
process measures of quality but does not reduce administrative or overall 
costs.
•
Equitable care means the provision of care that does not vary in quality because of 
personal characteristics such as sex, ethnicity, geographic location, and 
socioeconomic status. The aim of equity is to secure the benefits of quality health 
care for all the people of the United States. With regard to equity in caregiving, all 
individuals rightly expect to be treated fairly by local institutions, including 
healthcare organizations.

Chan et al19 demonstrated that rates of survival to discharge were lower 
for black patients (25.2%) than for white patients (37.4%). Lower rates of 
survival to discharge for blacks reflected lower rates of both successful 
resuscitation (55.8% versus 67.4%) and postresuscitation survival (45.2% 
versus 55.5%). Adjustment for the hospital site at which patients received 
care explained a substantial portion of the racial differences in successful 
resuscitation (adjusted RR 0.92; 95% CI, 0.88 to 0.96; P<0.001) and 
eliminated the racial differences in postresuscitation survival (adjusted 
RR 0.99; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.06; P=0.68). The authors concluded that 
much of the racial difference was associated with the hospital center in 
which black patients received care.
—
Cohen et al20 demonstrated that among hospitals engaged in a national 
quality monitoring and improvement program, evidence-based care for 
AMI appeared to improve over time for patients irrespective of race/
ethnicity, and differences in care by race/ethnicity care were reduced or 
eliminated. They analyzed 142 593 patients with AMI (121 528 whites, 
10 882 blacks, and 10 183 Hispanics) at 443 hospitals participating in the 
GWTG-CAD program. Overall, defect-free care was 80.9% for whites, 
79.5% for Hispanics (adjusted OR versus whites 1.00; 95% CI, 0.94 to 
1.06; P=0.94), and 77.7% for blacks (adjusted OR versus whites 0.93; 
95% CI, 0.87 to 0.98; P=0.01). A significant gap in defect-free care was 
observed for blacks during the first half of the study but was no longer 
present during the remainder of the study. Overall, progressive 
improvements in defect-free care were observed regardless of race/ethnic 
groups.

According to NHANES 1999 to 2006, 45% of adults had at least 1 of 3 
chronic conditions (hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or DM), 13% 
had 2 of these conditions, and 3% of adults had all 3 conditions. Non-
Hispanic black people were more likely than non-Hispanic white and 
Mexican-American people to have at least 1 of the 3 conditions. In 15% 
of US adults, 1 or more of the 3 conditions is undiagnosed.21

The total number of inpatient cardiovascular operations and procedures increased 
27%, from 5 382 000 in 1997 to 6 846 000 in 2007 (NHLBI computation based on 
NCHS annual data). Data from the NHDS were examined for trends from 1990 to 
2004 for use of PCI and CABG and in-hospital mortality rate due to PCI and 
CABG by sex.1
—
Discharge rates (per 10 000 population) for PCI increased 58%, from 37.2 
in 1990–1992 to 59.2 in 2002–2004.
—
Discharge rates for CABG increased from 34.1 in 1990–1992 to 38.6 in 
1996–1998, then declined to 25.2 in 2002–2004.
—
In 1990–1992, discharge rates for CABG were 53.5 for males and 18.1 
for females; these rates increased through 1996–1998, then declined to 
38.8 and 13.6, respectively, in 2002–2004. The magnitude of these

declines decreased by age decile and were essentially flat for both men 
and women 75 years of age.
—
PCI discharge rates increased from 54.5 for males and 23.0 for females to 
83.0 and 38.7 over the 15-year time interval. In 2002–2004, discharge 
rates for men and women 65 to 74 years of age were 135.1 and 64.0, 
respectively. For those 75 years of age, the rates were 128.7 and 69.0, 
respectively.
—
In-hospital mortality rate (deaths per 100 CABG discharges) declined 
from 4.3 to 3.5 in 2002 to 2004 despite an increase in Charlson 
comorbidity index. The mortality rate declined in all age and sex subsets, 
but especially in women.
—
PCI mortality remained stable over the 15-year interval.
•
Data from the Acute Care Tracker database were used to estimate the population-
based rates per 100 000 population for PCI and CABG procedures from 2002 to 
2005, standardized to the 2005 US population2:
—
Adjusted for age and sex, the overall rate for coronary revascularization 
declined from 382 to 358 per 100 000. PCI rates during hospitalization 
increased from 264 to 267 per 100 000, whereas CABG rates declined 
from 121 to 94.
•
Data from men and women enrolled in Medicare from 1992 to 2001 suggest that 
efforts to eliminate racial disparities in the use of high-cost cardiovascular 
procedures (PCI, CABG, and carotid endarterectomy) were unsuccessful.3
—
In 1992, among women, the age-standardized rates of carotid 
endarterectomy were 1.59 per 1000 enrollees for whites and 0.64 per 
1000 enrollees for blacks. By 2002, the rates were 2.42 per 1000 enrollees 
among white women and 1.15 per 1000 enrollees among black women. 
For men, the difference in rates between whites and blacks remained the 
same. In 1992, the rates were 3.13 per 1000 enrollees among white men 
and 0.82 per 1000 enrollees among black men; in 2001, the rates were 
4.42 and 1.44, respectively.
Cardiac Catheterization and PCI
•
From 1997 to 2007, the number of cardiac catheterizations decreased slightly, from 
1 112 000 to 1 059 000 annually.
•
In 2007, an estimated 622 000 patients underwent PCI (previously referred to as 
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, or PTCA) procedures in the 
United States (NHLBI tabulation, NHDS, NCHS).
•
In 2007, ≈67% of PCI procedures were performed on men, and ≈51% were 
performed on people ≥65 years of age (NHDS, NCHS).
•
The mortality rate for PCI has remained stable despite an increase in risk.1

•
In 2006, ≈76% of stents implanted during PCI were drug-eluting stents compared 
with 24% that were bare-metal stents.4
•
In a study of nontransferred patients with STEMI treated with primary PCI from 
July 2006 to March 2008, there was significant improvement over time in the 
percentage of patients receiving PCI within 90 minutes, from 54.1% from July to 
September 2006 to 74.1% from January to March 2008 among hospitals 
participating in the GWTG-CAD program. This improvement was seen whether or 
not hospitals joined the D2B Alliance during that period.5
Cardiac Open Heart Surgery
The NHDS (NCHS) estimates that in 2007, in the United States, 232 000 patients underwent 
a total of 408 000 coronary artery bypass procedures (defined by procedure codes). CABG 
volumes have declined nationally since 1998. Risk-adjusted mortality for CABG has 
declined significantly over the past decade:
•
Data from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons’ National Adult Cardiac Database 
(STS NCD), which voluntarily collects data from ≈80% of all hospitals that 
perform CABG in the United States, indicate that a total of 163 149 procedures 
involved CABG in 2009.6
•
Data from the STS NCD document a 50% decline in the risk-adjusted mortality rate 
despite a significant increase in preoperative surgical risk.7
Congenital Heart Surgery, 2005 to 2008 (From the Society of Thoracic Surgeons [STS])
There were 91 639 procedures performed from July 2005 to June 2009. The in-hospital 
mortality rate was 3.4% in 2009. The 5 most common diagnoses were the following: Patent 
ductus arteriosus (7.8%); hypoplastic left heart syndrome (7.0%); ventricular septal defect, 
type 2 (5.7%); tetralogy of Fallot (5.3%); and cardiac, other (4.7%).8
Congenital Heart Surgery, 1998 to 2002 (From STS)
There were 16 920 procedures performed from 1998 to 2002 at 18 centers. In 2002, there 
were 4208 procedures performed. The in-hospital mortality ranged from 5.7% in 1998 to 
4.3% in 2002. Of these procedures, ≈46% were performed in children >1 year old, ≈32% in 
infants between 29 days and 1 year of age, and ≈22% in neonates (<29 days old). The 
conditions for which these procedures were most commonly performed were the following: 
Patent ductus arteriosus (6.5%), ventricular septal defect (6.4%), and TOF (6.0%).
Heart Transplantations
In 2009, 2211 heart transplantations were performed in the United States. There are 249 
transplant hospitals in the United States, 127 of which perform heart transplantations 
(United Network for Organ Sharing, Web site accessed June 24, 2010).
•
Of the recipients, 72.1% are male, and 67.6% are white; 19.0% are black, whereas 
9.1% are Hispanic; 25.5% are <35 years of age, 17.9% are 35 to 49 years of age, 
and 56.6% are ≥50 years of age.

As of June 25, 2010, for transplants that occurred between 1997 and 2004, the 1-
year survival rate for males was 88.0%, and for females, it was 86.2%; the 3-year 
rates were 79.3% for males and 77.2% for females; and the 5-year rates were 
73.1% for males and 69.0% for females. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates for 
white cardiac transplant patients were 87.1%, 79.2%, and 72.5%, respectively. For 
black patients, they were 85.5%, 71.9%, and 62.3%, respectively. For Hispanic 
patients, they were 88.7%, 77.6%, and 72.1%, respectively.
•
As of June 25, 2010, 3153 patients were on the transplant waiting list for a heart 
transplant and 80 patients were on the list for a heart/lung transplant.
Cardiovascular Healthcare Expenditures
An analysis of claims and enrollment data from the Continuous Medicare History Sample 
and from physician claims from 1995 to 2004 was used to evaluate the conditions that 
contributed to the most expensive 5% of Medicare beneficiaries.9
•
Ischemic HD, CHF, and cerebrovascular disease, respectively, constituted 13.8%, 
5.9%, and 5.7% of the conditions of all beneficiaries in 2004. In patients in the top 
5% overall for all expenditures, the respective figures were 39.1%, 32.7%, and 
22.3% for these cardiovascular conditions.

22. Economic Cost of Cardiovascular Disease
See Tables 22-1 and 22-2 and Charts 22-1 and 22-2.
The total direct and indirect cost of CVD and stroke in the United States for 2007 is an 
estimated $286 billion (Table 22-1; Chart 22-1). This figure includes $167 billion in 
expenditures (direct costs, which include the cost of physicians and other professionals, 
hospital services, prescribed medications, and home health care) and $119 billion in lost 
productivity resulting from premature mortality (indirect costs).

The $286 billion is substantially lower than the estimate in the 2010 Statistical Update. 
Previously, annual estimates were based on the assumption that the proportion of CVD costs 
to total costs for physician services, hospital care, drugs, etc that were reported in a major 
study of 1995 direct costs were still valid in the current year. Each year, the 1995 
proportions were applied to current National Health Expenditure Accounts (NHEA) of 
aggregate personal healthcare expenditures from the CMS to estimate direct costs.1 Because 
the assumption becomes weaker each year, the decision was made to use another data 
source.
The previous estimates of indirect morbidity costs of CVD were also unsatisfactory because 
they were based on extrapolations from 1980 data and were only corrected for annual 
inflation. In addition, the estimates for the specific CVDs were based on crude assumptions 
that used data for bed disability days. The true indirect morbidity costs of lost productivity 
due to CVD illnesses are probably large, but data to estimate them are inadequate.
Thus, the following changes were made:
•
The annual direct cost estimates are available on the Web site of the nationally 
representative MEPS of the AHRQ.1
•
The estimates of indirect morbidity costs will be discontinued until adequate 
estimates can be made.
•
Estimates of all direct costs and indirect mortality costs are limited to the latest year 
for which MEPS data are available, 2007, rather than projecting costs to 2011.
The advantages of using data from MEPS are as follows:
•
MEPS is designed to estimate healthcare utilization and expenditures linked to 
specific medical conditions for the US civilian noninstitutionalized population, and 
the estimates are based on person-level survey data directly linked to patient care 
events.2
•
The estimates are available annually on the MEPS Web site and can be customized 
by age, sex, and race/ethnicity.1
•
MEPS data have been used extensively in scientific publications and reports.2
Some disadvantages of using data from MEPS are as follows:
•
MEPS cost estimates cover a narrower population and a narrower range of 
healthcare expenditures than the NHEA estimates.3 For example, costs of nursing 
home care are not included.
•
The MEPS data are based on household reports, which are subject to 
underreporting and misreporting of individual medical events and to annual 
fluctuation.2
•
The $286 billion estimate includes some double counting of costs for individuals 
classified in more than 1 of the 4 CVD groups.

•
Direct costs for CHD and HF are not included in the list of conditions on the MEPS 
Web site.
•
Direct costs for hypertension exclude costs for hypertensive HD, which are 
included in the HD costs. There is no estimate for total hypertension.
There is no change in the way mortality costs are estimated except to limit estimates to the 
same year (2007) as for direct costs (personal communication [unpublished table of present 
value of lifetime earnings by age and sex, United States, 2005] from Wendy Max, PhD, 
University of California at San Francisco, and data from the National Center for Health 
Statistics4 and the US Census Bureau5).
Most Costly Diseases
CVD and stroke accounted for 15% of the total health expenditures in 2007.2,6 The total cost 
and the indirect mortality cost estimates for CVD are higher than for any other major 
diagnostic group.1 By way of comparison, CVD total direct and indirect costs shown in 
Table 22-1 are higher than the official National Cancer Institute estimates for cancer and 
benign neoplasms in 2010, which were cited as $264 billion total, $103 billion direct, $21 
billion indirect morbidity, and $140 billion indirect cost of mortality.7
Table 22-2 shows direct and indirect costs for CVD by sex and by 2 broad age groups. Chart 
22-2 shows total direct costs for the 13 leading chronic diseases in the MEPS list.

acute ischemic (coronary) heart disease (I24), angina pectoris (I20), 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (I25.0), and all other forms of 
chronic ischemic CHD (I25.1–I25.9).
Death rate
The relative frequency with which death occurs within some 
specified interval of time in a population. National death rates are 
computed per 100 000 population. Dividing the total number of 
deaths by the total population gives a crude death rate for the total 
population. Rates calculated within specific subgroups, such as age-
specific or sex-specific rates, are often more meaningful and 
informative. They allow well-defined subgroups of the total 
population to be examined. Unless otherwise stated, all death rates 
in this publication are age adjusted and are per 100 000 population.
Diseases of the 
circulatory 
system (ICD 
codes I00–I99)
Included as part of what the AHA calls “cardiovascular disease.” 
(See “Total cardiovascular disease” in this Glossary.)
Diseases of the 
heart
Classification the NCHS uses in compiling the leading causes of 
death. Includes acute rheumatic fever/chronic rheumatic heart 
diseases (I00–I09), hypertensive heart disease (I11), hypertensive 
heart and renal disease (I13), coronary heart disease (I20 –I25), 
pulmonary heart disease and diseases of pulmonary circulation (I26 
–I28), heart failure (I50), and other forms of heart disease (I29 –I49, 
I50.1–I51). “Diseases of the heart” are not equivalent to “total 
cardiovascular disease,” which the AHA prefers to use to describe 
the leading causes of death.

Hispanic origin
In US government statistics, “Hispanic” includes people who trace 
their ancestry to Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Spain, the Spanish-
speaking countries of Central or South America, the Dominican 
Republic, or other Spanish cultures, regardless of race. It does not 
include people from Brazil, Guyana, Suriname, Trinidad, Belize, or 
Portugal, because Spanish is not the first language in those 
countries. Most of the data in this update are for Mexican Americans 
or Mexicans, as reported by government agencies or specific studies. 
In many cases, data for all Hispanics are more difficult to obtain.

Hospital 
discharges
The number of inpatients discharged from short-stay hospitals for 
whom some type of disease was the first-listed diagnosis. 
Discharges include those discharged alive, dead, or “status 
unknown.”
International 
Classification of 
Diseases (ICD) 
codes
A classification system in standard use in the United States. The 
International Classification of Diseases is published by the World 
Health Organization. This system is reviewed and revised 
approximately every 10 to 20 years to ensure its continued 
flexibility and feasibility. The 10th revision (ICD-10) began with the 
release of 1999 final mortality data. The ICD revisions can cause 
considerable change in the number of deaths reported for a given 
disease. The NCHS provides “comparability ratios” to compensate 
for the “shifting” of deaths from one ICD code to another. To 
compare the number or rate of deaths with that of an earlier year, the 
“comparability-modified” number or rate is used.
Incidence
An estimate of the number of new cases of a disease that develop in 
a population, usually in a 1-year period. For some statistics, new and 
recurrent attacks, or cases, are combined. The incidence of a specific 
disease is estimated by multiplying the incidence rates reported in 
community- or hospital-based studies by the US population. The 
rates in this report change only when new data are available; they 
are not computed annually.
Major 
cardiovascular 
diseases
Disease classification commonly reported by the NCHS; represents 
ICD codes I00 –I78. The AHA does not use “major cardiovascular 
diseases” for any calculations. See “Total cardiovascular disease” in 
this Glossary.
Metabolic 
syndrome
The metabolic syndrome is defined* as the presence of any 3 of the 
following 5 diagnostic measures: Elevated waist circumference 
(≥102 cm in men or ≥88 cm in women), elevated triglycerides (≥150 
mg/dL [1.7 mmol/L] or drug treatment for elevated triglycerides), 
reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (<40 mg/dL [0.9 
mmol/L] in men, <50 mg/dL [1.1 mmol/L] in women, or drug 
treatment for reduced HDL cholesterol), elevated blood pressure 
(≥130 mm Hg systolic blood pressure, ≥85 mm Hg diastolic blood 
pressure, or drug treatment for hypertension), and elevated fasting 
glucose (≥100 mg/dL or drug treatment for elevated glucose).
*According to criteria established by the American Heart 
Association/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and published 
in Circulation (Circulation. 2005;112:2735–2752).
Morbidity
Incidence and prevalence rates are both measures of morbidity (ie, 
measures of various effects of disease on a population).

Mortality
Mortality data for states can be obtained from the NCHS Web site 
(http://cdc.gov/nchs/), by direct communication with the CDC/
NCHS, or from the AHA on request. The total number of deaths due 
to a given disease in a population during a specific interval of time, 
usually a year, are reported. These data are compiled from death 
certificates and sent by state health agencies to the NCHS. The 
process of verifying and tabulating the data takes ≈2 years.
National Heart, 
Lung, and Blood 
Institute (NHLBI)
An institute in the National Institutes of Health in the US 
Department of Health and Human Services. The NHLBI conducts 
such studies as the following:
—
Framingham Heart Study (FHS) (1948 to …) (ongoing)
—
Honolulu Heart Program (HHP) (1965 to 1997)
—
Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) (1988 to …)

—
The NHLBI also published reports of the Joint National 
Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and 
Treatment of High Blood Pressure and the Third Report 
of the Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and 
Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult 
Treatment Panel III, or ATP III).
National Institute 
of Neurological 
Disorders and 
Stroke (NINDS)
An institute in the National Institutes of Health of the US 
Department of Health and Human Services. The NINDS sponsors 
and conducts research studies such as these:
—

—
Northern Manhattan Study (NOMAS)
—
Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi (BASIC) 
Project
Prevalence
An estimate of the total number of cases of a disease existing in a 
population during a specified period. Prevalence is sometimes 
expressed as a percentage of population. Rates for specific diseases 
are calculated from periodic health examination surveys that 
government agencies conduct. Annual changes in prevalence as 
reported in this statistical update reflect changes in the population

size. Changes in rates can be evaluated only by comparing 
prevalence rates estimated from surveys conducted in different 
years.
Note
In the data tables, which are located in the different disease and risk factor categories, if the 
percentages shown are age adjusted, they will not add to the total.
Race and Hispanic 
origin
Race and Hispanic origin are reported separately on death 
certificates. In this publication, unless otherwise specified, deaths 
of people of Hispanic origin are included in the totals for whites, 
blacks, American Indians or Alaska Natives, and Asian or Pacific 
Islanders according to the race listed on the decedent’s death 
certificate. Data for Hispanic people include all people of Hispanic 
origin of any race. See “Hispanic origin” in this Glossary.
Stroke (ICD-10 
codes I60–I69)
This category includes subarachnoid hemorrhage (I60); 
intracerebral hemorrhage (I61); other nontraumatic intracranial 
hemorrhage (I62); cerebral infarction (I63); stroke, not specified as 
hemorrhage or infarction (I64); occlusion and stenosis of 
precerebral arteries not resulting in cerebral infarction (I65); 
occlusion and stenosis of cerebral arteries not resulting in cerebral 
infarction (I66); other cerebrovascular diseases (I67); 
cerebrovascular disorders in diseases classified elsewhere (I68); 
and sequelae of cerebrovascular disease (I69).
Total 
cardiovascular 
disease (ICD-10 
codes I00–I99, 
Q20– Q28)
This category includes rheumatic fever/rheumatic heart disease 
(I00 –I09); hypertensive diseases (I10 –I15); ischemic (coronary) 
heart disease (I20 –I25); pulmonary heart disease and diseases of 
pulmonary circulation (I26 –I28); other forms of heart disease (I30 
–I52); cerebrovascular disease (stroke) (I60 –I69); atherosclerosis 
(I70); other diseases of arteries, arterioles, and capillaries (I71–
I79); diseases of veins, lymphatics, and lymph nodes not classified 
elsewhere (I80 –I89); and other and unspecified disorders of the 
circulatory system (I95–I99). When data are available, we include 
congenital cardiovascular defects (Q20–Q28).
Underlying cause 
of death or any-
mention cause of 
death
These terms are used by the NCHS when defining mortality. 
Underlying cause of death is defined by the World Health 
Organization as “the disease or injury which initiated the train of 
events leading directly to death, or the circumstances of the 
accident or violence which produced the fatal injury.” Contributing 
cause of death would be any other disease or condition that the 
decedent may also have had.

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality has released state-level data for heart disease for all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The data are taken from the Congressionally mandated National 
Healthcare Quality Report (NHQR), available at http://statesnapshots.ahrq.gov/snaps07/index.jsp. In addition, the Women’s Health and Mortality Chartbook of the National Center for Health Statistics has 
state-related data for women available at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/healthywomen/womenschartbook_aug2004.pdf. Also, at http://apps.nccd.cdc.gov/brfss-smart/index.asp, Metropolitan/Micropolitan 
Area Risk (MMSA) data are available for 500 such areas nationwide. Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data are also collected within each state (http://www.cdc.gov/brfss). The Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has the Geographic Information Systems (GIS), which provides mortality rates down to the county level, by sex and ethnicity, available at http://www.cdc.gov/gis/. 
The 2008 Atlas of Stroke Hospitalizations Among Medicare Beneficiaries (CDC, 2008) is a new resource that provides data down to the county level, by sex and race (available at http://www.cdc.gov/

CHD indicates coronary heart disease; MI, myocardial infarction; NH, non-Hispanic.
CHD includes people who responded “yes” to at least one of the questions in “Has a doctor or other health professional ever told you had coronary heart disease, angina or angina pectoris, heart attack, or 
myocardial infarction?” Those who answered “no” but were diagnosed with Rose angina are also included. Ellipses indicate data not available. Sources: Prevalence: National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey 2005–2008 (National Center for Health Statistics) and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Percentages for racial/ethnic groups are age-adjusted for Americans ≥20 years of age. 
Age-specific percentages are extrapolated to the 2008 US population estimates. These data are based on self-reports. Incidence: Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study (1987–2004), National Heart, 
Lung, and Blood Institute. Mortality: National Center for Health Statistics (these data represent underlying cause of death only). Hospital discharges: National Hospital Discharge Survey, National Center 
for Health Statistics (data include those inpatients discharged alive, dead, or status unknown).
*Mortality data are for whites and blacks and include Hispanics.
†These percentages represent the portion of total CHD mortality that is for males versus females.
‡Estimates include Hispanics and non-Hispanics. Estimates for whites include other nonblack races.

AP indicates angina pectoris; NH, non-Hispanic.
AP is chest pain or discomfort that results from insufficient blood flow to the heart muscle. Stable AP is predictable chest pain on exertion or under 
mental or emotional stress. The incidence estimate is for AP without myocardial infarction. Ellipses indicate data not available.
Sources: Prevalence: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005–2008 (National Center for Health Statistics) and National Heart, 
Lung, and Blood Institute; percentages for racial/ethnic groups are age adjusted for Americans ≥20 years of age. Angina pectoris includes persons 
who either answered “yes” to the question of ever having angina or angina pectoris of were diagnosed with Rose angina. Estimates from National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005–2008 (National Center for Health Statistics) were applied to 2008 population estimates (≥20 years 
of age). Incidence: AP uncomplicated by a myocardial infarction or with no myocardial infarction (Framingham Heart Study 1980 to 2001–2003 of 
the original cohort and 1980 to 1998–2001 of the Offspring Cohort, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute). Hospital discharges: National 
Hospital Discharge Survey, National Center for Health Statistics; data include those inpatients discharged alive, dead, or status unknown.
*There were 102 000 days of care for discharges with AP form short-stay hospitals in 2007.

Hypertension is defined in terms of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey blood pressure measurements and health interviews. A 
subject was considered hypertensive if systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥90, said “yes” to taking antihypertensive 
medication, or was told on 2 occasions of having hypertension.

ASD indicates atrial septal defect; HPLHS, hypoplastic left heart syndrome.
In 2003, 25 000 cardiovascular operations for congenital cardiovascular defects were performed on children <20 years of age. Inpatient mortality 
rate after all types of cardiac surgery was 4.8%. Nevertheless, mortality risk varies substantially for different defect types, from 0.4% for ASD 
repair to 25.2% for first-stage palliation for HPLHS. Fifty-five percent of operations were performed in males. In unadjusted analysis, mortality 
after cardiac surgery was somewhat higher for males than for females (5.1% versus 4.6%).

Data for white and black males and females are for non-Hispanics. Overweight and obesity in adults is body mass index ≥25 kg/m2. Obesity in adults is ≥ body mass index 30 kg/m2. In children, 
overweight and obesity are based on body mass index -for-age values ≥85th percentile of the 2000 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts. In children, obesity is based on body mass 
index -for-age values ≥95th percentile of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts.
In January 2007, the American Medical Association’s Expert Task Force on Childhood Obesity recommended new definitions for overweight and obesity in children and adolescents (available at http://
www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/433/ped_obesity_recs.pdf). However, statistics based on this new definition are not yet available.

*The analyses were adjusted for age, sex, income, education, use or nonuse of dialysis, and presence or absence of prior coronary heart disease, 
prior chronic heart failure, prior ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, prior peripheral arterial disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, 
dyslipidemia, a serum albumin level of ≤3.5 g/dL, dementia, cirrhosis or chronic liver disease, chronic lung disease, documented proteinuria, and 
prior hospitalizations.
†This group served as the reference group.

ACEI, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; LVEF, left ventricular ejection fraction.
Values are percentages.
*VHA: AMI patients.
†National Medicare and Medicaid: AMI patients.
‡AHA GWTG-CAD: Patients admitted with a cardiovascular event. In the GWTG-CAD registry, the in-hospital mortality rate was 4.5% (excludes transfer-out patients; if discharge status was missing, it 
was assumed to be “no.”). The mean length of hospital stay was 5.0 days (median 3.0 days).
§ACTION Registry: STEMI and NSTEMI patients were reported separately. Patients must have been admitted with acute ischemic symptoms within the previous 24 hours, typically reflected by a primary 
diagnosis of STEMI or NSTEMI. Patients who were admitted for any other clinical condition were not eligible.
‖Indicates the 7 key achievement measures targeted in GWTG-CAD. The composite quality-of-care measure for 2009 was 94.4%. The composite quality-of-care measure indicates performance on the 
provision of several elements of care. It is computed by summing the numerators for each key performance measure across the population of interest to create a composite numerator (all the care that was 
given), summing the denominators for each measure to form a composite denominator (all the care that should have been given), and reporting the ratio (the percentage of all the needed care that was 
given).

*Indicates the 5 key performance measures targeted in GWTG-HF. The composite quality-of-care measure for 2009 was 94.5%. The composite 
quality-of-care measure indicates performance on the provision of several elements of care. It is computed by summing the numerators for each 
key performance measure across the population of interest to create a composite numerator (all the care that was given), summing the denominators 
for each measure to form a composite denominator (all the care that should have been given), and reporting the ratio (the percentage of all the 
needed care that was given).

Ellipses (…) indicate data not available.
These data do not reflect any procedures performed on an outpatient basis. Many more procedures are being performed on an outpatient basis. Some of the lower numbers in this table compared with 2006 
probably reflect this trend.
*Breakdowns are not available for some procedures, so entries for some categories do not add to totals. These data include codes for which the estimated number of procedures is <5000. Categories of such 
small numbers are considered unreliable by NCHS and in some cases may have been omitted.
†Estimate should be used with caution because it may be unreliable or does not meet standards of reliability or precision.
§Because ≥1 procedure codes are required to describe the specific bypass procedure performed, it is impossible from these (mixed) data to determine the average number of grafts per patient.
‖Totals include procedures not shown here.
¶This estimate includes angioplasty and stent insertions for noncoronary arteries.

*This category includes coronary heart disease, heart failure, part of hypertensive disease, cardiac dysrhythmias, rheumatic heart disease, cardiomyopathy, pulmonary heart disease, and other or ill-defined 
heart diseases.
†Costs due to hypertensive disease are limited to hypertension without heart disease.
‡Medical Expenditure Panel Survey healthcare expenditures are estimates of direct payments for care of a patient with the given disease provided during the year, including out-of-pocket payments and 
payments by private insurance, Medicaid, Medicare, and other sources. Payments for over-the-counter drugs are not included. These estimates of direct costs do not include payments attributed to 
comorbidities. Total cardiovascular disease costs are the sum of costs for the 4 diseases but with some duplication.
§The Statistics Committee agreed to suspend presenting estimates of lost productivity due to morbidity until a better estimating method can be developed.
‖Earnings of persons who died in 2007, discounted at 3%.
Sources: Estimates from the Household Component of the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality for direct costs (2007).1 Indirect mortality costs are based 
on 2007 counts of deaths by the National Center for Health Statistics and an estimated present value of lifetime earnings furnished for 2005 by Wendy Max (Institute for Health and Aging, University of 
California, San Francisco, 2009) and inflated to 2007 from mean earnings values reported by the US Census Bureau.4,5
