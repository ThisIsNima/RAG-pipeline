Abstract
Purpose of the review—To review recent epidemiological research on age‐of‐onset (AOO) of
mental disorders, focusing on the WHO World Mental Health (WMH) surveys.
Recent findings—Median and inter‐quartile range (IQR; 25th–75th percentiles) of AOO is much
earlier for phobias (7–14, IQR: 4–20) and impulse‐control disorders (7–15, IQR: 4–35) than other
anxiety disorders (25–53, IQR: 15–75), mood disorders (25–45, IQR: 17–65), and substance
disorders (18–29, IQR: 16–43). Although less data exist for non‐affective psychosis, available
evidence suggests that median AOO is in the range late teens through early 20s. Roughly half of all
lifetime mental disorders in most studies start by the mid‐teens and three‐fourths by the mid‐20s.
Later onsets are mostly secondary conditions. Severe disorders are typically preceded by less severe
disorders that seldom are brought to clinical attention.
Summary—First onset of mental disorders usually occurs in childhood or adolescence, although
treatment typically does not occur until a number of years later. Although interventions with early
incipient disorders might help reduce severity‐persistence of primary disorders and prevent
secondary disorders, additional research is needed on appropriate treatments for early incipient cases
and on long‐term evaluation of the effects of early intervention on secondary prevention.

Introduction
The purpose of this paper is to review recent evidence from epidemiological surveys on the
age of onset (AOO) distributions of commonly occurring mental disorders. Although AOO is
one of the least commonly studied aspects of descriptive epidemiology, it is important for
reasons described below. The recent publication of comprehensive AOO results from the
World Health Organization’s World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys provides unprecedented
data on the AOO distributions of many commonly occurring mental disorders. These data have

several important implications for clinical practice and research that are discussed in the second
half of the review.
Practical difficulties in studying age of onset
The dearth of information on AOO of mental disorders is presumably due to reluctance on the
part of epidemiologists to rely on the retrospective reports obtained in general population
surveys that, as a practical matter, must be used to generate the survival distributions needed
to study AOO. Two theoretical alternatives exist to relying on these retrospective reports,
although neither of the two is broadly feasible. The first applies largely to psychosis: to use
information obtained about total‐population incidence of treated disorder from studies of
psychotic disorders in catchment areas that monitor all points of contact with the treatment
system (e.g., [1,2]). The implicit assumption in this approach, that the vast majority of
psychotics eventually come to clinical attention, is likely to be true, making this approach useful
for studying AOO of non‐affective psychosis. The same approach would not be nearly as useful,
though, for less severely impairing disorders, as many people with such disorders never come
to clinical attention. Even for non‐affective psychosis, epidemiological surveys show that the
time between onset of the first episode and first contact with the treatment system is sometimes
quite long [3], although analysis of incident treated cases is still the best available approach
due to the substantial under‐representation of psychosis in community epidemiological surveys
[4*].
The second theoretical alternative to relying on retrospective AOO reports is to carry out large
long‐term prospective surveys to estimate incidence directly. Numerous studies of this sort
exist in such well‐funded fields of cancer epidemiology (e.g., [5]) and cardiovascular
epidemiology (e.g., [6]). Comparable studies of mental disorders do not exist. Although some
large long‐term community epidemiological studies have included some information on mental
disorders (e.g., www.nshd.mrc.ac.uk), the data collection waves are not sufficient frequent and
the assessment mental disorder interval incidence not sufficiently central to generate accurate
prospective estimates of incidence. Prospective birth cohort studies in schizophrenia that cover
the whole age range of risk for the onset of the disorder are sparse (e.g., [7,8]). As a result, we
have to rely largely on retrospective reports in cross‐sectional community surveys to estimate
AOO distributions of commonly occurring mental disorders.
Why study age of onset?
An examination of AOO distributions is important for at least two reasons. One is that
information on AOO allows us to distinguish between lifetime prevalence (the proportion of
the population who had a disorder at some time in their life up to their age at interview) and
projected lifetime risk (the estimated proportion of the population who will have the disorder
by the end of their life). Lifetime risk cannot be estimated directly from community surveys
because respondents differ in age and, therefore, number of years at risk. Projections of
estimated future risk can be made from AOO distributions, though, using either the Kaplan‐
Meier [9] method or the slightly more precise actuarial method [10] to estimate survival
distributions. Second, an understanding of AOO is important for targeting research on
prevention of mental disorders [11**], early intervention with prodromal or incipient mental
disorders [12], and primary prevention of secondary disorders [13]. In the absence of AOO
information, we would have no way to know the appropriate age range to target preventive
interventions. A related issue is that early AOO is often found to be associated with greater
disorder severity [14], persistence [15], and lack of treatment response [16]. Based on these
associations, AOO information can be useful in making projections of aggregate illness course
associated with primary and secondary disorders.

WMH Survey Methods
As the main focus of the following review is on the WMH surveys, we present a brief overview
of WMH methods. The WMH Survey Initiative consists of coordinated population surveys in
28 countries [17]. The main aim is to provide estimate of the prevalence, distribution, societal
burden, and patterns of treatment of mental disorders to health policy makers for planning
purposes. The WMH interview schedule and all other study materials were translated using
standardized WHO protocols. Consistent interviewer training and quality control procedures
were used in all surveys. The informed consent was obtained in each country using procedures
approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the organizations coordinating the survey in
the country.
The WHO regions and 16 countries that have completed and published WMH results up to
now are Africa (Nigeria; South Africa), the Americas (Colombia; Mexico; United States), Asia
and the Pacific (Japan; New Zealand; Beijing and Shanghai in the People’s Republic of China
‐ henceforth referred to as Metropolitan PRC), Europe (Belgium; France; Germany; Italy; the
Netherlands; Spain; Ukraine); and the Middle East (Israel; Lebanon). The surveys in most of
these countries were nationally representative (the exceptions being China, Japan, and Nigeria,
which were regionally representative). Seven of the countries are classified by the World Bank
as less developed (China, Colombia, Lebanon, Mexico, Nigeria, South Africa, Ukraine), while
the others are classified as developed [18]. All surveys were conducted face‐to‐face by trained
lay interviewers in multi‐stage household probability samples. A total of 85,052 interviews
were completed in these 16 countries, with samples ranging from 2372 in the Netherlands to
12,992 in New Zealand. The weighted average response rate was 71.1%. More details on WMH
samples, designs, and field procedures are presented at www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/WMH.
The WMH diagnostic interview was the WHO Composite Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) Version
3.0 [19], a fully‐structured lay‐administered interview that generates both ICD‐10 and DSM‐
IV diagnoses. DSM‐IV diagnoses were used in the analyses reviewed here. Included were
anxiety disorders (panic disorder, agoraphobia without panic disorder, specific phobia, social
phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, post‐traumatic stress disorder, separation anxiety
disorder), mood disorders (major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, bipolar disorder I
and II, sub‐threshold bipolar disorder), impulse‐control disorders (intermittent explosive
disorder, oppositional‐defiant disorder, attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct
disorder), and substance use disorders (alcohol and drug abuse with or without dependence).
Not all disorders were assessed in all countries. Non‐affective psychosis (NAP) was not
assessed because the CIDI assessment of NAP was not sufficiently reliable and valid [20].
Clinical calibration studies [21] found that the CIDI assessed other disorders with good
concordance to blinded clinical reappraisal interviews using the Structured Clinical Interview
for DSM‐IV (SCID) [22].
Research carried out in conjunction with the landmark Epidemiological Catchment Area (ECA)
[23]. Study found that retrospective AOO reports often generate implausible response patterns,
indicating the existence of retrospective recall bias [24]. Special procedures developed by
survey methodologists to minimize this bias were used in the WMH surveys both to decrease
recall failure involving the lifetime occurrence of disorders [19] and to decrease imprecision
in dating the AOO of reported disorders [25]. Experimental research has shown that this
question sequence yields responses with a much more plausible AOO distribution than standard
AOO questions [25].

Age of onset distributions of commonly occurring disorders
Disorder‐specific estimates of AOO distributions have either been published for WMH surveys
in Italy [26], Metropolitan China [27], Mexico [28], New Zealand [29], Nigeria [30], Spain
[31], Ukraine [32], and the USA [33]. In addition, a comparative analysis of these distributions
across 16 WMH countries has been completed [34**]. Systematic comparison of these results
documents a number of clear cross‐national consistencies both within and between disorders.
The impulse‐control disorders have the earliest AOO distributions, with median AOO across
countries of 7–9 years for attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), 7–15 for
oppositional‐defiant disorder (ODD), 9–14 for conduct disorder (CD), and 13–21 for
intermittent explosive disorder (IED). Impulse‐control disorders also have an extremely narrow
age range of onset risk. For example, 80% of all lifetime ADHD begins in the age range 4–11,
while the vast majority of ODD and CD begins between ages 5 and 15. Fully half of all lifetime
IED begins in childhood or adolescence.
Some anxiety disorders — the phobias and separation anxiety disorder (SAD) — also have
very early AOO distributions, with median AOO in the range 7–14 and inter‐quartile range
(IQR; 25th–75th percentiles of the AOO distributions) of 4–20. The other anxiety disorders
(panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and post‐traumatic stress disorder), in
comparison, have considerably later AOO distributions, although the cross‐national variation
in both median AOO (25–53) and in IQR AOO (15–75) is considerably wider than for the
impulse‐control disorders or the phobias or SAD.
The mood disorder AOO distributions in the WMH surveys are quite similar to those for the
later‐onset anxiety disorders. Mood disorder AOO curves show consistently low prevalence
until the early teens followed by a roughly linear increase through late middle age and a
declining increase thereafter. The median AOO of mood disorders has a very wide range across
countries (25–45) and an even wider IQR (17–65).
The AOO distributions of substance use disorders, finally, are quite consistent across the WMH
countries in that few onsets occur prior to the mid teens and cumulative increase in onset is
rapid in adolescence and early adulthood. Considerable cross‐national variation exists, though,
in the sharpness of the change in the slope as well as in the age range of this change. This
cross‐national variation leads to wider cross‐national variation in both the median (18–29) and
the inter‐quartile range (16–43) of the AOO distributions than for impulse‐control disorders
or phobias or SAD, but lower variation than for mood disorders or other anxiety disorders.
No strong consistency in between‐country differences in AOO distributions were detected
across disorders. Furthermore, between‐country differences in these distributions were found
to be unrelated to economic development, to region of the world, or to other structural
correlates.
The age of onset distribution of treated psychosis
Psychotic disorders rarely occur before age 14, but show a marked increase in prevalence
between at ages 15–17 [35]. Schizophrenia spectrum diagnoses (SSD) account for
approximately two‐thirds of all psychotic disorders. Schizophrenia usually bens in the age
range 15–35. Disorder‐specific estimates of AOO distributions for non‐affective and affective
psychotic disorders have not been separately reported in any of the WMH surveys due to the
under‐representation of these cases in surveys.
As noted above, studies that either establish the treated incidence of psychosis in a well defined
catchment area or that observe onsets in long‐term prospective general population cohorts are

preferred. An integrated community‐based treatment system is needed to obtain accurate data
on treated incidence. A good example of such a system can be found at the Early Psychosis
Prevention and Intervention Centre (EPPIC) in Melbourne, Australia. This is a community‐
based specialized service mandated to treat all people between 15 and 29 years who present
with a first psychotic episode to public mental health services in a geographically defined
catchment area. Between 1997 and 2000, 1019 individuals were registered at EPPIC with a
first episode of psychosis. The median age of initial presentation in this cohort was 22 with an
IQR of 19–25. The same median and IQR existed for patients with SSD (69%) and those with
non‐SSD (31%).
Similar results were found in the 1966 North Finland Birth Cohort, where median AOO and
IQR for schizophrenia were 23 and 19–27 [8], and in the 1946 British 1946 birth cohort (median
AOO for schizophrenia 22) [7]. The majority of psychoses manifest in the third life decade
with a median in the early twenties and a narrow inter‐quartile range more similar to
impulse‐control disorders and some anxiety disorders than mood disorders.
Projected lifetime risk in comparison to lifetime‐prevalence‐to‐date
As noted in the introduction, one important reason for estimating AOO distributions is to obtain
data on projected lifetime risk. It is noteworthy that the estimates of projected lifetime risk of
any DSM‐IV disorder in the WMH surveys was roughly one‐third higher (IQR 28–44%) than
estimated lifetime prevalence‐to‐date. This means that 3–4 people in the populations of these
countries are likely to develop a first mental disorder at some time in the future for every ten
people who already had a disorder. The highest risk‐to‐prevalence ratios (57–69%) were found
in countries exposed to sectarian violence (Israel, Nigeria, South Africa). Excluding these three,
no strong difference in risk‐to‐prevalence ratios were found of less developed countries (28–
41%) versus developed countries (17–49%).
Not surprisingly, the highest class‐specific proportional increase in projected lifetime risk
versus prevalence was associated with mood disorders (IQR 61–98%) and the lowest with
impulse‐control disorders (IQR 0–2%). These differences reflect the fact that many mood
disorders begin in middle age or old age, while the vast majority of impulse‐control disorders
begin in childhood or adolescence.
The high comorbidity known to exist among mental disorders [36–38] would be expected to
result in many WMH respondents who developed impulse‐control disorders or early‐onset
anxiety disorders subsequently developing substance, mood, or later‐onset anxiety disorders.
This possibility was investigated by comparing the risk‐to‐prevalence ratios of any disorder
versus individual disorders. This showed that the vast majority of projected new onsets of
individual disorders would be secondary disorders, as indicated by the fact that the risk‐to‐
prevalence ratio for any disorder is close to 1.0 in most countries.
Limitations
The WMH results are limited by the possibility that people with a history of mental illness
might be less likely than others to participate in community surveys or might under‐report their
disorders. Although innovative strategies were used to minimize the latter problem [19], it is
unlikely that they were completely successful. AOO might have been recalled incorrectly as
well [24] despite the WMH surveys using a novel probing strategy to reduce bias in AOO
reports. Estimates of psychosis AOO were limited by their being based on incident
treatment. The AOO results are further limited by focusing on syndrome onset, ignoring any
prodrome at an earlier age. A number of at‐risk mental states are known to occur prior to the
onset of many cases of NAP [39*] and bipolar disorder [40]. A number of problem behaviors
indicative of impulsivity are known to occur prior to the onset of many cases of impulse‐control

disorders [41]. Childhood behavioral inhibition is known to occur prior to the onset of many
cases of panic disorder and depression [42]. Epidemiological analysis of these early indicators
of incipient disorder would almost certainly lead to much earlier estimates of AOO than those
reported here.
Implications
Within the context of these limitations, the AOO distributions reported here are consistent with
those in previous epidemiological surveys [43,44]. We know of no research prior to the WMH
surveys that examined AOO distributions of PTSD, but one would expect these to be quite
variable due to trauma exposure occurring throughout the life course. Nor are we aware of
previous research on the AOO distributions of impulse‐control disorders, although the lifetime
prevalence estimates of these disorders in the WMH surveys [29,33] are in the range reported
in previous surveys of adolescents [45,46]. No previous research has examined the temporal
concentration of AOO or highlighted the concentration of onset ages for most disorders in a
very narrow time span. It is striking in this regard that the upper bounds of the AOO IQR’s for
disorders with narrow ranges are all quite early: the mid teens for impulse‐control disorders
and anxiety disorders with narrow IQR’s and the late 20s for substance use disorders. These
are opposite the patterns found for chronic physical disorders, where conditional risk increases
with age and the upper bound of the IQR is in late middle age or old age [47].
Investigations of initial contact with the treatment system based on data collected in a number
of community epidemiological surveys [48] have consistently found that many people wait
more than a decade after first onset of a mental disorder before seeking treatment. These people
often present with highly comorbid conditions that might have been easier to treat if they had
sought treatment earlier in the course of illness. Early treatment of first‐onset disorders would
often mean childhood‐adolescent treatment. Unfortunately, we know little about treatment of
mild child‐adolescent cases and even less about treatment of incipient child‐adolescent cases.
A complicating factor is that the effects of psychotropic medications can be quite different on
children‐adolescents than adults [49]. The most active research of this sort deals with treating
incipient psychosis [11**] and early stages of adolescent substance use disorder [50], although
much remains to be learned about the best ways to treat of these early cases.
Conclusion
The results reported here show clearly that first onset of mental disorders usually occurs in
childhood or adolescence. Although it is thought that timely interventions with early‐onset
cases might help reduce severity‐persistence of primary disorders, prevent or delay onset of
secondary disorders, or reduce persistence‐severity of secondary disorders, much preclinical
and clinical research is needed on treatments of early cases to determine whether this is true.
Epidemiological research is also needed on the long‐term consequences of early interventions
for long‐term secondary prevention.

suggests that early AOO of certain psychiatric symptoms is an independent factor relevant for
defining samples specifically at risk for schizophrenia.

2005;39:964–971. [PubMed: 16343296]The paper describes the Comprehensive Assessment of
At‐Risk Mental States (CAARMS), an instrument which has been designed for monitoring
subthreshold psychotic symptoms for worsening into full‐threshold psychotic disorder. It has two
functions: (i) to assess psychopathology thought to indicate imminent development of a first‐episode
psychotic disorder; and (ii) to determine if an individual meets criteria for being at ultra high risk
for onset of first psychotic disorder.
