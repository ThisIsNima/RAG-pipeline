Forests and Climate Change:
Forcings, Feedbacks, and the
Climate Benefits of Forests
Gordon B. Bonan
The world’s forests influence climate through physical, chemical, and biological processes that
affect planetary energetics, the hydrologic cycle, and atmospheric composition. These complex and
nonlinear forest-atmosphere interactions can dampen or amplify anthropogenic climate change.
Tropical, temperate, and boreal reforestation and afforestation attenuate global warming through
carbon sequestration. Biogeophysical feedbacks can enhance or diminish this negative climate
forcing. Tropical forests mitigate warming through evaporative cooling, but the low albedo of
boreal forests is a positive climate forcing. The evaporative effect of temperate forests is
unclear. The net climate forcing from these and other processes is not known. Forests are under
tremendous pressure from global change. Interdisciplinary science that integrates knowledge of the
many interacting climate services of forests with the impacts of global change is necessary to
identify and understand as yet unexplored feedbacks in the Earth system and the potential of
forests to mitigate climate change.
F
orests cover ~42 million km2 in tropical,
temperate, and boreal lands, ~30% of the
land surface (Fig. 1A). These forests pro-
vide ecological, economic, social, and aesthetic
services to natural systems and humankind (1),
including refuges for biodiversity, provision of
food, medicinal, and forest products, regulation of
the hydrologic cycle, protection of soil resources,
recreational uses, spiritual needs, and aesthetic val-
ues. Additionally, forests influence climate through
exchanges of energy, water, carbon dioxide, and
other chemical species with the atmosphere.
Forests store ~45% of terrestrial carbon (Fig.
1B), contribute ~50% of terrestrial net primary
production (2), and can sequester large amounts
of carbon annually (Fig. 1C). Carbon uptake by
forests contributed to a “residual” 2.6 Pg C year−1
terrestrial carbon sink in the 1990s, ~33% of anthro-
pogenic carbon emission from fossil fuel and land-
use change (3). Forests have low surface albedo and
can mask the high albedo of snow (Fig. 1D),
which contributes to planetary warming through
increased solar heating of land. Forests sustain the
hydrologic cycle through evapotranspiration, which
cools climate through feedbacks with clouds and
precipitation. The ratio of evapotranspiration to
available energy is generally low in forest com-
pared with some crops and lower in conifer forest
than in deciduous broadleaf forest (Fig. 1E).
That forests influence climate has long been
postulated. From the onset of European settle-
ment of North America, it was believed that clear-
ing of forests for cultivation, wood products, and
settlement altered climate (4). Today, scientists
have a diverse array of methodologies, including
eddy covariance flux towers, free-air CO2 enrich-
ment systems, satellite sensors, and mathematical
models to investigate the coupling between for-
ests and the atmosphere. It is now understood that
forests and human uses of forests provide im-
portant climate forcings and feedbacks (3), that
climate change may adversely affect ecosystem
functions (5), and that forests can be managed to
mitigate climate change (6). What is lacking, how-
ever, is science that integrates the many interact-
ing climate services of forests with the impacts of
global change to inform climate change mitigation
policy.
Accordingly, this article reviews biosphere-
atmosphere interactions in tropical, temperate, and
boreal forests. Emphasis is placed on biogeo-
physical processes (albedo and evapotranspiration)
(7), their comparison with biogeochemical pro-
cesses (carbon cycle) (8), and alteration of forest-
atmosphere coupling through biogeographical
processes (land use and vegetation dynamics) (9).
The Ecology of Climate Models
The influence of forests on large-scale climate
is difficult to establish directly through obser-
vations. Careful examination of climatic data
can sometimes reveal an ecological influence,
such as the effect of leaf emergence on spring-
time evapotranspiration and air temperature.
Eddy covariance flux towers and field exper-
iments provide local-scale insight to forest-
atmosphere interactions, and advances in remote
sensing science can aid extrapolation of this
knowledge to larger spatial scales. More often,
however, our understanding of how forests af-
fect climate comes from atmospheric models and
their numerical parameterizations of Earth’s land
surface (10). Paired climate simulations, one
serving as a control to compare against another
simulation with altered vegetation, demonstrate
an ecological influence on climate.
Atmospheric models require fluxes of energy,
moisture, and momentum at the land surface as
boundary conditions to solve numerical equa-
tions of atmospheric physics and dynamics. The
first generation of land surface parameteriza-
tions developed in the late 1960s and 1970s used
bulk aerodynamic formulations of energy ex-
change without explicitly representing vegetation
[supporting online material (SOM)]. Soil water
availability regulates latent heat flux, and the hy-
drologic cycle, when included, was simplified to a
“bucket” model of soil water. In this approach,
precipitation fills the soil column up to a specified
water-holding capacity, beyond which rainfall
runs off.
By the mid-1980s, the second generation of
land surface parameterizations, included the hy-
drologic cycle and the effects of vegetation on
energy and water fluxes. These models explicitly
represent plant canopies, including radiative trans-
fer, turbulent processes above and within the can-
opy, and the physical and biological controls of
evapotranspiration (Fig. 2A). Snow cover, the soil
water profile, and vegetation influences on the
hydrologic cycle are also included (Fig. 2B). In
the mid-1990s, plant physiological theory further
advanced the incorporation of biological control
of evapotranspiration in the third generation of
models. Models now routinely link the biochem-
istry of photosynthesis with the biophysics of
stomatal conductance. Leaf photosynthesis and
conductance are scaled to the plant canopy based
on the optimal allocation of nitrogen and photo-
synthetic capacity in relation to light availability.
Simulations with these models have routinely
demonstrated biogeophysical regulation of cli-
mate by vegetation through albedo, turbulent
fluxes, and the hydrologic cycle (10).
The current generation of models has capa-
bility beyond hydrometeorology and incorpo-
rates ecological advances in biogeochemical and
biogeographical modeling (10). Many models
simulate the carbon cycle (Fig. 2C) and vegeta-
tion dynamics (Fig. 2D). In these models, the
biosphere and atmosphere form a coupled system
whereby climate influences ecosystem functions
and biogeography, which feed back to affect
climate. Much of the natural vegetation of the
world has been cleared for agriculture (Fig. 3D),
and some models also include land-use change.
Tropical Forests
Climate model simulations show that tropical
forests maintain high rates of evapotranspiration,
decrease surface air temperature, and increase pre-
cipitation compared with pastureland (SOM). The
most studied region is Amazonia, where large-scale
conversion of forest to pasture creates a warmer,
drier climate. Surface warming arising from the
low albedo of forests is offset by strong evapo-

rative cooling. Similar results are seen in tropical
Africa and Asia, and the climatic influence of
tropical forests may extend to the extratropics
through atmospheric teleconnections. However,
forest-atmosphere interactions are complex, and
small-scale, heterogeneous deforestation may
produce mesoscale circulations that enhance clouds
and precipitation.
Flux tower measurements in the Brazilian
Amazon confirm that forests have lower albedo
compared with pasture, greater net radiation, and
greater evapotranspiration, particularly during
the dry season (11, 12), producing a shallow,
cool, and moist boundary layer. Observations
show that forest transpiration is sustained dur-
ing the dry season (11); this is seen also in CO2
fluxes (12) and satellite monitoring of vegetation
(13, 14), to a greater extent than represented in
many models.
Tropical forests contain ~25% of the carbon in
the terrestrial biosphere (Fig. 1B), account for ~33%
of terrestrial net primary production (NPP) (2), and
can sequester large amounts of carbon annually (Fig.
1C).Deforestationreleased1.6PgCyear−1duringthe
1990s, chiefly in the tropics (3). Atmospheric analy-
ses suggest that tropical forests are carbon neutral or
carbon sinks, which implies offsetting of carbon
uptake by undisturbed tropical ecosystems (3, 15).
The net balance among these processes is
likely a positive benefit that mitigates global
warming through evaporative cooling and carbon
sequestration (8). Yet a more complete analysis of
forest-atmosphere interactions is required. The bio-
geochemistryof tropicalforestsandbiomassburning
affects atmospheric chemistry and aerosols, which
can alter clouds andrainfall(16).Interannual climate
variability modulates forest-atmosphere coupling.
There is net release of carbon from the biosphere to
the atmosphere during warm, dry El Niño years,
seen in high atmospheric CO2 growth rates (3), es-
pecially in the tropics (17). Drought makes tropical
forests more susceptible to burning during land
clearing (18). However, tropical forest productivity
may be more resilient to drought than expected (14).
The future of tropical forests is at risk in a
warmer, more populous 21st-century world.
Tropical forests are vulnerable to a warmer, drier
climate (19), which may exacerbate global warm-
ing through a positive feedback that decreases
evaporative cooling, releases CO2, and initiates
forest dieback (20). Loss of natural forests world-
wide in the tropics during the 1990s was as high
as 152,000 km2 year−1 (1), and Amazonian for-
ests were cleared at a rate of ~25,000 km2 year−1
(19). Such land-use pressures are expected to
continue in the future and may shift the Amazo-
nian region to a permanently drier climate once a
critical threshold of clearing is reached.
Boreal Forests
Climate model simulations show that the low sur-
face albedo during the snow season, evident in
local flux measurements (21) and satellite-derived
surface albedo (Fig. 1D), warms climate com-
pared to when there is an absence of trees (SOM).
Consequently, the boreal forest has the greatest
biogeophysical effect of all biomes on annual
mean global temperature (7). Loss of boreal for-
est provides a positive feedback for glaciation (22),
whereas forest expansion during the mid-Holocene
6000 years ago amplified warming (23).
Boreal forests differ in their partitioning of
net radiation into sensible and latent heat fluxes.
Conifer forests have low summertime evapora-
tive fraction (defined as the ratio of latent heat
flux to available energy) compared with decid-
uous broadleaf forests, producing high rates of
sensible heat exchange and deep atmospheric
boundary layers (21). Flux tower measurements
illustrate the potential for changes in species
composition, arising from change in the fire
regime, to affect climate (24). Along an 80-year
fire chronosequence in Alaska, annual net radi-
ation declined by 31% at a 3-year-old postburn

site dominated by grasses and a 15-year-old
aspen (Populus tremuloides) forest compared
with an 80-year-old black spruce (Picea mariana)
forest, primarily in spring and summer. Annual
sensible heat flux decreased by more than 50%
compared with the 80-year site, mostly in spring
and summer. During summer, the aspen forest
had the highest latent heat flux, lowest sensible
heat flux, and lowest midday Bowen ratio
(defined as the ratio of sensible heat flux to
latent heat flux).
Boreal ecosystems store a large amount of
carbon in soil, permafrost, and wetland (2) and
contribute to the Northern Hemisphere terrestrial
carbon sink (3), although mature forests have low
annual carbon gain (Fig. 1C). The climate forcing
from increased albedo may offset the forcing
from carbon emission so that boreal deforestation
cools climate (8). Similar conclusions are drawn
from comprehensive analysis of the climate forc-
ing of boreal fires (25). The long-term forcing is a
balance between postfire increase in surface
albedo and the radiative forcing from greenhouse
gases emitted during combustion. Averaged over
an 80-year fire cycle, the negative forcing from
surface albedo exceeds the smaller positive bio-
geochemical forcing. Yet in the first year after
fire, positive annual biogeochemical forcing from
greenhouse gas emission, ozone, black carbon
deposited on snow and ice, and aerosols exceeds
the negative albedo forcing.
Boreal forests are vulnerable to global warming

along southern prairie ecotones. In the main boreal
forest, there may be loss of evergreen trees and a
shift toward deciduous trees. Siberian forests may
collapse in some areas and become more evergreen
inthenorth.Increaseddisturbance fromfire or insect
outbreaks will shift the forest to a younger age class.
Climate forcing arising from younger stand age may
be comparable to that arising from biome shifts (24).
Temperate Forests
Much of the temperate forests of the eastern
United States, Europe, and eastern China have
been cleared for agriculture (Fig. 3D). Croplands
have a higher albedo than forests (Fig. 1D), and
many climate model simulations find that trees
warm surface air temperature relative to crops
(SOM). Masking of snow albedo by trees is impor-
tant in cool temperate climates with snow. Studies
of eastern United States forests find that trees also
maintain a warmer summer climate compared with
crops because of their lower albedo, augmented by
evaporative cooling from crops and feedbacks
with the atmosphere that affect clouds and pre-
cipitation (26). The influence of crops on evapo-
transpiration is seen in flux tower measurements.
Growing season evaporative cooling is greater over
watered crops compared with forests, and these
plants exert less evaporative resistance (Fig. 1E).
Although global climate models find that tem-
perate forests in the eastern United States warm
summer temperature (26), mesoscale model sim-
ulations of the July climate of the United States
find that trees increase evapotranspiration and de-
crease surface air temperature compared with crops
(27, 28). Atmospheric feedbacks that alter cloud-
iness affect the magnitude of the temperature re-
sponse in these simulations. Flux tower analyses
show that conifer and deciduous broadleaf forests
in North Carolina have lower surface radiative
temperature than grass fields because of greater
aerodynamic conductance and evaporative cooling
of trees compared with grasses (29), but the same
may not pertain to cropland (Fig. 1E).
Interannual climate variability affects biosphere-
atmosphere coupling. In western Europe, forest and
agricultural land have comparable surface radiative
temperature when soil is moist but respond differ-
ently to drought (30). Forest maintains green vegeta-
tion, as indicated by the normalized difference
vegetation index, although surface temperature
and sensible heat flux increase with drought. Vege-
tation greenness in cropland declines by ~50%,
the surface warms 13°C more than in forest, and
the drought enhancement in sensible heat flux is
greater than for forest. The different response to
drought arises from the deep roots of trees and
their access to deeper reservoirs of soil water.
Temperate forests hold ~20% of the world’s
plant biomass and ~10% of terrestrial carbon
(Fig. 1B). Carbon sequestration rates of mature
forests are high (Fig. 1C), but temperate forests in
the United States historically have been carbon
sources because of deforestation (31). Socioeco-
nomic trends in reforestation and fire suppression
have shifted these forests to a carbon sink. Similar
trends are seen in Europe (3).
The net climate forcing of temperate forests
is highly uncertain. Competing biogeophysical
forcings from low albedo during winter and evapo-
transpiration during summer influence annual mean
temperature (7). Higher albedo with loss of forest
cover could offset carbon emission so that the net
climatic effect of temperate deforestation is negli-
gible (8), or reduced evapotranspiration with loss
of trees could amplify biogeochemical warming.
The future of temperate forests and their
climate services is highly uncertain. The present
carbon sink in eastern United States forests is
likely to decline as recovering forests mature (31),
and these forests face uncertain pressure from cli-
mate change, atmospheric CO2 increase, and an-
thropogenic nitrogen deposition (5). Change in
the balance between deciduous and evergreen
trees is likely in the future. Temperate forests are
particularly vulnerable to human land use. The
trend over the past several decades has been
toward farm abandonment, reforestation, and
woody encroachment from fire suppression, but
meeting the needs of a growing global population
could place greater pressures on these forests.
Carbon Cycle Feedbacks
The carbon cycle has long been recognized as im-
portant for understanding climate change. Climate
models that include the terrestrial and oceanic car-
bon cycle simulate a positive feedback between the
carbon cycle and climate warming that increases the
airborne fraction of anthropogenic CO2 emission
and amplifies warming (3, 32). In a comparison of
11 models of varying degrees of complexity, carbon
cycle–climate feedbacks increase atmospheric CO2
at the end of the 21st century by 4 to 44% (multi-
model mean, 18%), equivalent to an additional 20
to 224 (parts per million) (ppm) (multimodel mean,
87 ppm) (3). Analyses of observed atmospheric
CO2 concentrations indicate that such a decline in
the efficiency of the carbon cycle to store anthro-
pogenic CO2 in ocean and land is occurring, and to
a greater extent than estimated by models (33).
Much of the model uncertainty arises from the
terrestrial biosphere (3, 32). Plants respond to rising
atmospheric CO2 through photosynthetic enhance-
ment, and this “CO2 fertilization” is a negative feed-
back to higher atmospheric CO2 concentration. In
the multimodel comparison, land carbon storage in-
creases with higher atmospheric CO2 in all models,
driven by a 12 to 76% increase in NPP with CO2
doubling (multimodel mean, 48%), offset slightly
by enhanced heterotrophic respiration (3). Free-air
CO2 enrichment studies in forests find that a ~50%
increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration sustained
overseveralyearsenhancesNPPby23%(34),butthe
long-term outcome is unclear, especially when inter-
actions with nitrogen availability are considered (5).
Climate change reduces carbon storage from
CO2 fertilization. Terrestrial carbon storage declines
with warming in the 11 models (multimodel mean,
–79 Pg C °C−1), but this varies greatly among
models (3). Soil carbon turnover rate increases by
2 to 10% °C−1 in all models in a positive climate
feedback (multimodel mean, 6% °C−1). Terrestrial
NPP decreases by up to –6% °C−1 in seven models
(multimodel mean, –3% °C−1) and increases by 1 to
2% °C−1 in four models. Climate change can en-
hance NPP (negative feedback) in boreal forests
where temperature increases and decrease NPP
(positive feedback) in tropical forests where greater
evaporative demand dries soil (35).
Ecological responses to climate change alter the
biogeophysical functioning of forests and also pro-
vide climate feedback. These“indirect” carbon cycle
feedbacks include changes in stomatal conductance,
leaf area index, and species composition. Decreased
stomatal conductance with higher atmospheric CO2
concentration reduces evapotranspiration and rein-
forces warming (SOM). More extensive tree cover
may enhance warming in boreal forests by decreas-
ing surface albedo. Reduced evapotranspiration in a
drier climate may initiate a positiveclimate feedback
leading to loss of tropical forest (20).
Land-Use Forcing
Although carbon emission from forest clearing
has long been studied, only recently has the
biogeophysical forcing of climate from land use
been recognized. Vast tracts of forestland have
been converted to agriculture (Fig. 3D), and cli-
mate warming over the industrial era may be
smaller than that expected from rising atmospher-
ic CO2 alone, primarily from increased spring
albedo with loss of extratropical forests (36).
Carbon emission from land use dampens
biogeophysical cooling. The dominant compet-
ing signals from historical deforestation are an
increase in surface albedo countered by carbon
emission to the atmosphere. Biogeophysical cool-
ing may outweigh biogeochemical warming at the
global scale (37) or may only partially offset
warming (38). The net effect of these competing
processes is small globally but is large in tem-
perate and high northern latitudes where the cool-
ing due to an increase in surface albedo outweighs
the warming due to land-use CO2 emission.
Climate trends over the 21st century, too, should
be driven by interactions among CO2 emission, land
use, and forest-atmosphere feedbacks. The biogeo-
physical land-use forcing of climate may in some
regions be of similar magnitude to greenhouse gas
climate change. The Intergovernmental Panel on
ClimateChange(IPCC)SpecialReportonEmission
Scenarios (SRES) A2 narrative storyline has high
CO2 emission (SOM), and climate model simu-
lations of Feddema et al. (39) produce 2°C warming
of planetary temperature over the 21st century in the
absence of land cover change. The A2 storyline de-
scribes widespread agricultural expansion with most
land suitable for agriculture used for farming by
2100 to support a large global population (fig. S1).

zonia, but cooling that mitigates warming in mid-
latitudes (39). The B1 narrative storyline is a low
greenhouse gas emission scenario. Farm abandon-
ment and reforestation yield loss of farmland by
2100 because of assumed increases in agricultural
efficiency and declining population (fig. S1). The
model simulates 1°C warming in the absence of
land cover change and weaker land-use forcing.
When the carbon cycle is included, the dif-
ferent SRES storylines of fossil fuel emission and
land use may yield similar 21st-century climates
despite vastly different socioeconomic trajectories
(9). Widespread expansion of agriculture in A2
leads to biogeophysical cooling. Biogeophysical
processes lead to warming in B1, primarily because
of temperate forest regrowth. In the A2 and B1
storylines,net carbon loss from deforestation causes
biogeochemicalwarming,greatest in A2 because of
extensive deforestation and weaker in B1 because
of temperate reforestation and less tropical de-
forestation. Biogeochemical warming offsets bio-
geophysical cooling in A2 to provide net global
warming. The B1 net warming is similar to A2
because moderate biogeophysical warming from
temperate reforestation augments weak biogeo-
chemical warming from tropical deforestation.
Research Needs
Through albedo, evapotranspiration, the carbon cy-
cle, and other processes,forests can amplify or damp-
en climate change arising from anthropogenic
greenhouse gas emission. Negative climate forcing
in tropical forests from high rates of carbon accu-
mulation augments strong evaporative cooling (Fig.
3A). The combined carbon cycle and biogeophys-
ical effect of tropical forests may cool global cli-
mate, but their resilience to drought, their status as
carbon sinks, interactions of fires, aerosols, and
reactive gases with climate, and the effects of small-
scale deforestation on clouds and precipitation are
key unknowns. The climate forcing of boreal forests
is less certain (Fig. 3C). Low surface albedo may
outweigh carbon sequestration so that boreal forests
warm global climate, but the net forcing from fire
must also be considered, as well as effects of dis-

mate benefit of temperate forests is most uncertain
(Fig. 3B). Reforestation and afforestation may se-
quester carbon, but the albedo and evaporative forc-
ings are moderate compared with other forests and
the evaporative influence is unclear.
Much of our knowledge of forest influences on
climate, and our ability to inform climate change
mitigation policy, comes from models. Models of
climate and the biosphere are abstractions of com-
plex physical, chemical, and biological processes
in the Earth system. Extrapolation of process-level
understanding of ecosystem functioning gained
from laboratory experiments or site-specific field
studies to large-scale climate models remains a
daunting challenge. Biosphere models must be
better constrained with observational data across a
range of scales from in situ experimentation, flux
tower measurements of ecosystem functioning, eco-
logical syntheses of long-term ecosystem research,
satellite monitoring of vegetation, and atmospheric
monitoring of CO2. Synthesis of flux tower data
from a variety of boreal, temperate, and tropical
regions in various stages of ecosystem development
is essential to understand the functioning of forests
across wide gradients of climate, soils, disturbance
history, and plant functional types (40). Large-scale

or the response of vegetation to drought (42) provide
essential tests of model response to perturbations.
Global atmospheric CO2 analyses provide key con-
straints to biospheric functioning to augment process-
level model validation at specific locales (15).
Global models of the biosphere-atmosphere sys-
tem are still in their infancy, and processes not yet
included in the models may initiate unforeseen feed-
backs. The effect of nitrogen on carbon uptake (43),
physiological effects of high ozone concentration
(44),photosyntheticenhancementbydiffuseradiation
(45), and disturbance (46) are poorly represented,
if at all. Realistic depictions of vegetation dynamics,
especially the time scales of vegetation response to
disturbance, long a mainstay of forest ecosystem
modeling, are barely considered in the current gen-
eration of models. Nor are fires, aerosols, and reac-
tive chemistry well represented in the models.
The carbon cycle and its response to multiple
interacting drivers of global change is a key aspect
of the biospheric forcing of climate. So, too, are
human uses of land and the socioeconomic trends
and societal responses to a changing climate that
drive land use. What are the greatest uncertainties
in simulating the carbon cycle of the 21st century?
The prevailing paradigm of current models is that
CO2 fertilization drives terrestrial carbon sinks,
weakened by global warming (3, 32). This carbon
cycle–climate feedback will almost certainly be
refined with further studies that incorporate the ni-
trogen cycle. Accounting for disturbance from wild-
fires and insect outbreaks further weakens terrestrial
carbon sequestration in Canadian forests (46). Tra-
jectories of land use driven by socioeconomic needs
and policy implementation will also come into play
and have competing biogeophysical and biogeo-
chemical impacts on climate (9).
As the climate benefits of forests become better
understood, land-use policies can be crafted to miti-
gate climate change (6). It has been inferred, for ex-
ample, that tropical afforestation is likely to “slow
down” global warming, whereas temperate affores-
tation has “little to no” climate benefit and boreal
afforestation is “counterproductive” (8). These poli-
ciesmustrecognizethemultitudeofforestinfluences,
their competing effects on climate, their different
spatial and temporal scales, and their long-term ef-
fectiveness and sustainability in a changing climate.
An integrated assessment of forest influences
entails an evaluation beyond albedo, evapotranspi-
ration, and carbon to include other greenhouse
gases, biogenic aerosols, and reactive gases. The
geographic impact of these processes varies, as
does their time scale of climate forcing. Greenhouse
gases are well mixed in the atmosphere and influ-
ence global climate; biogeophysical feedbacks have
a regional impact. Biogeophysical processes influ-
ence climate more immediately than does the car-
bon cycle. Slow rates of carbon accumulation in
boreal forest may in the short-term be offsetby more
rapid albedo effects. How forests attenuate or am-
plify climate change will vary with global warming.
Vegetation masking of snow albedo becomes less
important in a warmer world with less extensive
snow cover. The evaporative cooling of forests de-
clines if droughts become more common. The in-
terrelatedness of climate change science, climate
impacts on ecosystems, and climate change mitiga-
tion policy requires that these be studied together in
an interdisciplinary framework to craft strong
science in the service of humankind.
