Urban land-cover change threatens biodiversity and affects eco-
system productivity through loss of habitat, biomass, and carbon
storage. However, despite projections that world urban popula-
tions will increase to nearly 5 billion by 2030, little is known about
future locations, magnitudes, and rates of urban expansion. Here
we develop spatially explicit probabilistic forecasts of global urban
land-cover change and explore the direct impacts on biodiversity
hotspots and tropical carbon biomass. If current trends in pop-
ulation density continue and all areas with high probabilities of
urban expansion undergo change, then by 2030, urban land cover
will increase by 1.2 million km2, nearly tripling the global urban land
area circa 2000. This increase would result in considerable loss of
habitats in key biodiversity hotspots, with the highest rates of fore-
casted urban growth to take place in regions that were relatively
undisturbed by urban development in 2000: the Eastern Afromon-
tane, the Guinean Forests of West Africa, and the Western Ghats
and Sri Lanka hotspots. Within the pan-tropics, loss in vegetation
biomass from areas with high probability of urban expansion is
estimated to be 1.38 PgC (0.05 PgC yr−1), equal to ∼5% of emissions
from tropical deforestation and land-use change. Although urban-
ization is often considered a local issue, the aggregate global
impacts of projected urban expansion will require signiﬁcant policy
changes to affect future growth trajectories to minimize global
biodiversity and vegetation carbon losses.

F
or centuries, cities were compact with high population den-
sities, and the physical extent of cities grew slowly (1). This
trend has been reversed over the last 30 y. Today, urban areas
around the world are expanding on average twice as fast than
their populations (2, 3). Although urban land cover is a relatively
small fraction of the total Earth surface, urban areas drive global
environmental change (4). Urban expansion and associated land-
cover change drives habitat loss (5, 6), threatens biodiversity (7),
and results in the loss of terrestrial carbon stored in vegetation
biomass (8). Land-cover change could lead to the loss of up to
40% of the species in some of the most biologically diverse areas
around the world (9), and as of 2000, 88% of the global primary
vegetation land cover had been destroyed in “biodiversity hot-
spots” (10). The results of many local-scale studies highlight the
need to understand the aggregate impact of urban expansion and
land-cover change on biodiversity at the global scale.
The most recent United Nations projections show an increase
in urban population of 1.35 billion by 2030 (11). How will the
expected increase in urban populations to nearly 5 billion by 2030,
combined with positive outlooks for future global economic growth,
manifest in urban land-cover change and in turn affect biodiversity
and carbon pools? Here we present spatially explicit probabilistic
forecasts of global urban expansion and explore the direct impacts
on biodiversity and terrestrial carbon storage. We use global land
cover circa 2000 (12) and projections of urban population (13, 14)
and gross domestic product (GDP) growth (15) in a probabilistic
model of urban land change to develop 1,000 projections of urban
expansion through to 2030. We then use independent sources on
biodiversity hotspots, threatened species, and carbon pools to ex-
amine the likely consequences of forecasted urban growth on the
direct loss of habitat and biomass carbon.
Global Urban Expansion to 2030
Although urban population growth is a global phenomenon, our
results show that the bulk of urban expansion and associated
land-cover change will be concentrated in a few regions (Fig.
1A). Globally, more than 5.87 million km2 of land have a positive
probability (>0%) of being converted to urban areas by 2030,
and 20% of this (1.2 million km2) have high probabilities (>75%)
of urban expansion (Table 1). If all areas with high probability
(>75%) undergo urban land conversion, there will be a 185%
increase in the global urban extent from circa 2000.
Nearly half of the increase in high-probability urban expansion
globally is forecasted to occur in Asia, with China and India ab-
sorbing 55% of the regional total. In China, urban expansion is
forecasted to create a 1,800-km coastal urban corridor from
Hangzhou to Shenyang (Fig. 1B). In India, urban expansion is
forecasted to be clustered around seven state capital cities, with
large areas of low-probability growth forecasted in the Himalayan
region, where many small villages and towns currently exist. The
rate of increase in urban land cover is predicted to be highest in
Africa, at 590% over the 2000 levels (Table 1). Here, expansion
will be concentrated in ﬁve regions: the Nile River in Egypt, the
coast of West Africa on the Gulf of Guinea, the northern shores
of Lake Victoria in Kenya and Uganda and extending into
Rwanda and Burundi, the Kano region in northern Nigeria, and
greater Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. In North America, where the
percentage of total population living in urban areas is already high
(78%), the forecasts show a near doubling of urban land cover by
2030. The forecasts also indicate that 48 of the 221 countries in
the study will experience negligible amounts of urban expansion.
In many countries, there is an inverse relationship between the
probability that speciﬁc geographic locations will experience
urban expansion and magnitude of predicted urban expansion
(Table 1 and Fig. S1). For example, total forecasted area of
urban expansion in Mexico is small, but the probability that
speciﬁc locations in Mexico will undergo urban expansion is high
(Fig. 1C). In contrast, Turkey has low probabilities of urban ex-
pansion in many parts of the country, and the predicted magni-
tude of total urban expansion is also relatively low (Fig. 1D). In
the remaining presentation of the results, unless otherwise noted,
our discussion will be limited to only the areas with high proba-
bility of urban expansion.
Direct Impacts of Urban Expansion on Habitat and
Biodiversity
We use an independent dataset of 34 established biodiversity
hotspots (10, 16) and examine the spatial overlap between their
locations and our forecasts of urban expansion.
Less than 1% of all hotspot areas were urbanized circa 2000.
By 2030, new urban expansion will take up an additional 1.8% of
all hotspot areas (Table 2). Five biodiversity hotspots are

forecasted to have the largest percentages of their areas to be-
come urban: the Guinean forests of West Africa (7%), Japan
(6%), the Caribbean Islands (4%), the Philippines (4%), and the
Western Ghats and Sri Lanka (4%). The hotspots with the largest
percentages of their areas that will be threatened by low proba-
bilities of expansion are in the Caucasus (24%), the Irano-Ana-
tolian (20%), the Guinean forests of West Africa (16%), and the
Mediterranean Basin (14%). In contrast, the East Melanesian
Islands in Oceania, the Mountains of Southwest China, and the
Succulent Karoo in Southern Africa are forecasted to be largely
unaffected directly by urban expansion. The Mediterranean Basin
and the Atlantic Forest hotspots had the most urban area circa
2000 and are expected to experience about a 160% increase in
their urban extent from 2000 to 2030. However, the highest rates
of growth in urban area are forecasted to take place in regions that
were relatively undisturbed by urban development circa 2000: the
Eastern Afromontane, the Guinean Forests of West Africa, and
the Western Ghats and Sri Lanka hotspots. Urban areas in these
three hotspots are forecasted to increase by ∼1,900%, 920%, and
900% over their 2000 levels, respectively (Table 2).
We also examine the spatial overlap between the urban ex-
pansion forecasts with Alliance for Zero Extinction (AZE) sites
across the world (17, 18). More than a quarter of species in
amphibian, mammalian, and reptilian classes each will be af-
fected in varying degrees from urban expansion in AZE sites
(Table 3). Habitats are expected to be encroached upon or
destroyed by urban expansion for 139 amphibian species, 41
mammalians species, and 25 bird species that are on either the
Critically Endangered or Endangered Lists of the International
Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Africa and Europe
are expected to have the highest percentages of AZE species to
be affected by urban expansion, 30% and 33%, respectively
(Table 3). However, the Americas will have the largest number
of species affected by urban expansion, 134, representing one-
quarter of all AZE species in the region.
Direct Impacts of Urban Expansion on Carbon Pools
Deforestation and forest degradation are currently estimated to
contribute 6–17% of total anthropogenic CO2 emissions (19),
with the vast majority originating in the tropics. Until recently,
urbanization was viewed as a negligible driver of deforestation
(20, 21). However, annual deforestation rates have been de-
creasing since the mid-1990s, but urban extent has been in-
creasing globally over the last three decades (3). Based on
independent space-borne Geosciences Laser Altimeter System
light detection and ranging measurements (22), we estimate the
immediate aboveground biomass carbon losses associated with
land clearing from projected high-probability (>75%) new urban
areas in the pan-tropics to be 1.38 PgC between 2000 and 2030
(0.05 PgC yr−1) (Fig. 2), representing ∼5% of the tropical de-
forestation and land use change emissions (22). Although carbon
losses associated with new urban areas can occur in the more

the forecasted urban expansion is likely to occur in eastern China (B). Some regions have high probability of urban expansion is speciﬁc locations (C) and
others have large areas of low probability urban growth (D). Dashed lines denote northern and southern boundaries of the tropics.

degraded portions of forests due to their proximity to existing
settlements, the carbon losses reported here capture these car-
bon density differences through variation in measured vegetation
structure and disturbance status (Fig. 2).
Both the carbon density and probability of conversion vary
regionally within the tropics, with the greatest probable losses
most likely in the Americas and Africa, 0.50 and 0.49 PgC, re-
spectively (Fig. 2). However, the highest carbon densities are in
the tropical Americas and China. The total regional carbon
losses reﬂect both the carbon density and the amount of land
likely to be converted to urban within each region. Therefore,
although carbon density is lower in Africa than in China, the
forecasts show more urban expansion in pan-tropical Africa,
resulting in a greater total regional carbon loss. Indeed, the
majority of China—and the forecasted urban expansion—is not
in the pan-tropics but rather the northern temperate zone.
Aboveground carbon losses from urban expansion in the
tropics are likely to represent a large fraction of the immediate
urbanization carbon losses because of the high tropical forest
carbon densities and high urban growth rates in this region.
Nonetheless, the 1.38 PgC carbon loss reported here is likely
a lower-bound estimate of urban growth-related carbon losses
because 63% of the projected new urban land is outside the pan-
tropics and will contribute to additional carbon and biomass
losses. Furthermore, although there is a paucity of data, the soil
carbon losses associated with expanding impervious surface
cover have the potential to reduce soil carbon pools by 66% (23).
As with most land-cover changes, new urban areas can contain
remnant patches of vegetation and the amount of vegetation can
increase with time since clearing and development (24). How-
ever, the vegetation within urban areas is typically more frag-
mented (25) and can contain an altered species assemblage
depending on growing conditions and social preferences (26).
Discussion
Since the ﬁrst release in 1969 of the report Growth of the World’s
Urban and Rural Population, 1920–2000, the United Nations has
become the primary source of global urbanization projections.
Although the United Nations World Urbanization Prospects pro-
vide country-level information on the percentage of populations
in urban areas, they do not give intracountry variations of urban
population distribution, the location of urban areas, or changes in
urban land cover. Our study complements the information pro-
vided by the United Nations by providing spatially explicit proba-
bilistic forecasts of urban expansion. Numerous models of urban
expansion exist, but most focus on individual cities, city-regions, or
in a few cases, countries (27, 28). To understand how urbanization
will affect Earth system functioning and the global environment,
we need to begin developing spatially explicit global forecasts of
urban expansion that go beyond the demographic dimension.
Our analysis generates probability estimates of whether a 25
km2 area will become urban, based on a combination of pop-
ulation and GDP projections, and existing population densities
and urban extents (see SI Materials and Methods). Our high-
probability forecast of 1.2 million km2 of new urban land by 2030
is equivalent to an area about the size of South Africa. Put an-
other way, using only the high-probability forecast, 65% of all
urban land area on the planet in 2030 will become urban during
the ﬁrst three decades of the 21st century. This forecast suggests
a brief window of opportunity for policy decisions to shape the
long-term effects of urbanization. The forecasted growth in ur-
ban extent will be concomitant with an enormous infrastructure
boom in road construction, water and sanitation, energy and
transport, and buildings that will transform land cover and cities
globally. Recent estimates suggest that between $25 and $30
trillion US dollars will be spent on infrastructure worldwide by
2030, with $100 billion a year in China alone (29). Given the long
life and near irreversibility of infrastructure investments, it will
be critical for current urbanization-related policies to consider
their lasting impacts. There also may be potential cobeneﬁts
between urban sustainability policies and conservation policies.
High-density urban communities have lower per capita energy use
and greenhouse emissions than low-density suburban development
(30, 31). Compact development could serve a secondary goal of
saving land for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services.
However, realization of these synergies requires more holistic
policies that integrate traditional urban sectors—transport, energy,
sanitation, buildings—with land use and conservation.
The wide range in forecasts of urban expansion reﬂects the
uncertainties in the underlying drivers, such as population
growth. History has proven some past projections of population
growth to be grossly inaccurate (32) and there still remain large
uncertainties around population-growth estimates (33). Addi-
tionally, for many developing and emerging economies, pop-
ulation and economic growth may explain only a small fraction of
the urban land expansion. For example, GDP is a strong driver of
urban land expansion in China but only moderately affects urban
expansion in India and Africa, where urban population growth is

a larger factor (3). Moreover, our model does not include the
informal economy, which is estimated to contribute as much as
44% of the Gross National Product in Africa (34).
The results show that within individual countries, there is both
high spatial variability and high spatial concentration of the
likelihood of urban expansion. For example, the United Nations
identiﬁes 58 high-fertility countries, 39 of which are in Africa,
where the bulk of population growth will occur in the near future
(35). Our analysis provides more geographic detail and shows
that within the 39 African countries, urban expansion is highly
likely to be concentrated in only a few regions (Fig. S2). Contrary
to expectations, countries with similar rates of population or
economic growth do not result in the same probabilities of urban
expansion. The results show two major potential types of future
urban expansion: high probability of urban growth in speciﬁc
locations and low probability of urban growth over large areas.
For example, there is high probability that the northern shores of
Lake Victoria, from Kampala, Uganda to Kisumu, Kenya, will
become a continuous built-up area.
The 2012 United Nations urban population projections in-
dicate that Nigeria’s cities are expected grow by 200 million
people over the next 40 y (11). Our spatially explicit projections,
developed before the release of the most recent United Nations
report, show that Nigeria will experience high probabilities of
urban expansion in speciﬁc locations, mainly in the Kano region
and around Port Harcourt along the southern coast, a region
vulnerable to climate change impacts and where a majority of the
population lives in informal settlements (36). In these and other
regions with high likelihoods of urban expansion, there is a need
to develop preemptive land use and conservation strategies to
mitigate the negative consequences of urbanization. Further-
more, although the results show that there is high probability
that the land will become urban, the form and structure of the
built environment remains to be determined. In countries like
Yemen, Turkey, Syria, and Iraq with low probabilities of urban
expansion across large areas, there is a high degree of un-
certainty about where and how urban expansion will take place.
Under such conditions, land-use planning, the location of foreign
investments, the establishment of free trade or export processing
zones, and investments in infrastructure could shape the location
and form of future urban growth.
If all areas with high probability (>75%) become urban, the
urban land cover in the biodiversity hotspots around the world
will increase by more than 200% between 2000 and 2030, with
substantial variations in the rate and amount of increase across
individual hotspots (Table 2). There is also signiﬁcant hetero-
geneity in the quality of habitat within each hotspot, and there-
fore not every location within a hotspot will be equally important

for conservation (10). However, even relatively small decreases
in habitat can cause extinction rates to rise disproportionately in
already diminished and severely fragmented habitats, such as the
Mediterranean and the Atlantic Forest hotspots. All ﬁve bio-
diversity hotspots with the largest percentages of their land areas
forecasted to become urban predominantly occupy coastal
regions or are islands (Table 2). In addition, although projected
urban expansion in the Caribbean Islands and the Philippines is
relatively small in total area, they are home to 1.9% and 2.3% of
the world’s endemic plants and 1.9% and 2.9% of endemic
invertebrates, respectively (10). Large numbers of AZE species
will face increasing pressure from urban expansion in the next
two decades. Although urbanization rates will be highest in
China and India, it is in Central and South America where the
largest number of AZE species will be affected (Table 3). Our
results suggest the need for conservation policies that consider
urban growth at both regional and global scales. The threat to
biodiversity hotspots comes from direct land-cover change and
subsequent loss of habitat, and from increased colonization by
introduced species as urban areas expand. Establishing bio-
diversity corridors in these regions with higher probability of
urban expansion will require coordinated efforts among multiple
cities and municipalities. Such corridors may take on additional
signiﬁcance considering the migration of species in response to
shifts in their ranges with climate change (37).
Most efforts that study terrestrial carbon dynamics have avoided
areas heavily inﬂuenced by urbanization (24). However, the pro-
cess of urban expansion also results in carbon emissions because of
the land clearing, reductions in local primary productivity (8) and,
depending on the climate and density of the new development, has
the potential to either increase or decrease per capita greenhouse
gas emissions. The aboveground carbon and habitat losses high-
light that urban expansion is an important driver of land-cover
change and forest degradation. The biomass carbon losses repor-
ted here represent short-term emissions associated clearing for
urban development and land-cover change. As with most land-
cover change, vegetation can regrow over time, but the annualized
emissions associated with deforestation and forest degradation do
not capture those long-term changes.
The analysis in this article only examines the direct spatial
“imprint” of urban expansion on biodiversity hotspots, AZE
species, and carbon biomass, and not the indirect land-change
processes that both drive and respond to urbanization. Urban
expansion can also affect land uses in distal places, which in turn
can alter carbon stocks, especially in the tropics (20, 38). This
“indirect” urbanization affect is difﬁcult to fully quantify. In
some cases, it will amplify and in other cases attenuate carbon
losses. We know that cities have always relied on their hinter-
lands and other distal places for resources from food and fuel to
waste assimilation. For example, a typical household in Sydney
or Melbourne is responsible for greenhouse gas emissions, water
withdrawals, and land use distributed across all of Australia (39).
The magnitude of the virtual carbon, water, and land embodied
in urban areas means that the bulk of environmental impacts
from future urban expansion is also likely to occur outside of the
areas forecasted to become urban.
Although a full assessment of the indirect environmental
impacts of urban expansion is beyond the scope of this analysis,
two urbanization factors are known to have signiﬁcant indirect
environmental effects. First, the spatial pattern of urban de-
velopment, such as compactness, employment and residential
densities, and mix of land uses affects energy use and carbon
dioxide emissions (40). Second, urban consumption patterns are
often different from rural counterparts. For example, the com-
position of urban diets is considerably higher in meat and dairy
intake than rural counterparts (41). In turn, a diet higher in meat
also increases the demand for fodder. Thus, the indirect effects
of urbanization, including increased afﬂuence and changes in
consumption patterns, are highly uncertain and potentially very
large. Both direct and indirect components need to be considered
to fully account for the environmental impacts of urban expansion.

Conclusions
Urbanization is often considered a local issue. However, our
analysis shows that the direct impacts of future urban expansion
on global biodiversity hotspots and carbon pools are signiﬁcant.
At the same time, the full environmental impacts will not be
conﬁned to urban boundaries and will largely be felt elsewhere.
Although populations are increasingly living in urban areas, the
results show that there is large spatial variation in the magnitude
and location of urban expansion between and within countries.
That the ﬁrst 30 y of the 21st century is highly likely to ex-
perience more urban land expansion than all of history suggests
a considerable—and limited—window of opportunity to shape
future urbanization. For guidance on how policies could help, we
should look to Aldo Leopold and the prescient words of Sir Alex
Gordon, past president of the Royal Institute of British Archi-
tects. Gordon’s ideas of “long life,” “loose ﬁt,” and “low energy”
(42) suggest that future urbanization should avoid infrastructure
“lock-in,” be adaptable to unforeseen demands, and have low
embodied and operating energy needs. Applying Leopold’s “land
ethic” (43) to the concept of urban sustainability requires that
the connections between urban processes and land-use change
are made explicit and that future considerations about sustain-
able cities incorporate direct and indirect changes in the land
brought about by urbanization.
Materials and Methods
Forecasting Urban Expansion Globally. We use ﬁve sources of data to forecast
urban expansion: global urban extent circa 2000 from National Aeronautics and
Space Administration’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (12),
urban population projections to 2030 from the United Nations, population
projection uncertainty ranges from the US National Research Council (14),
population density estimates from the Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project,
and country-level GDP projections by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change Special Reports on Emissions Scenarios (15). We develop models for 16
geographic regions, broadly based on United Nations deﬁned world regions
(Table S1). The forecasts are developed in two phases. In the ﬁrst phase, for
each region we generate 1,000 estimates of aggregate amount of urban ex-
pansion by randomly drawing 1,000 values each from the corresponding
probability density functions (PDFs) of projected GDP and urban population.
We use the uncertainty ranges in population and GDP projections to estimate
the corresponding PDFs. In the second phase, we use the aggregate amounts
and simulate their spatial distribution using a spatially explicit grid-based land-
change model (44), which uses slope, distance to roads, population density,
and land cover as the primary drivers of land change. Our analysis assumes no
new road development. Signiﬁcant changes in road development would
change the spatial patterns but not the amount of new urban expansion. See
SI Materials and Methods and Figs. S3–S5 for more details.
Urbanization Impacts on Biodiversity Hotspots, Endangered and Critically
Endangered Species, and Carbon Pools. For the hotspot analysis, we use estab-
lished global biodiversity hotspots databases (10, 16). For the impacts on species
evaluated to be Endangered or Critically Endangered under IUCN-World
Conservation Union criteria, we use the AZE dataset (17). For the carbon-loss
analysis, we use the Woods Hole Research Center, pan-tropical aboveground
carbon density map (22). Biomass is assumed to be 50% carbon (45). Carbon loss
because of urban expansion is estimated by overlaying the measured carbon
density map with the probabilistic urban expansion map and calculating the
aboveground carbon present in each conversion probability quartile.
