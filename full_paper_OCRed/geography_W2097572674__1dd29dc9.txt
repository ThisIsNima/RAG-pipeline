Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Despite the potential importance of understanding excess mortality among 
people with mental disorders, no comprehensive meta-analyses have been conducted quantifying 
mortality across mental disorders.
OBJECTIVE—To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of mortality among people 
with mental disorders and examine differences in mortality risks by type of death, diagnosis, and 
study characteristics.
DATA SOURCES—We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and Web of Science from 
inception through May 7, 2014, including references of eligible articles. Our search strategy 
included terms for mental disorders (eg, mental disorders, serious mental illness, and severe 
mental illness), specific diagnoses (eg, schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder), 
and mortality. We also used Google Scholar to identify articles that cited eligible articles.

STUDY SELECTION—English-language cohort studies that reported a mortality estimate of 
mental disorders compared with a general population or controls from the same study setting 
without mental illness were included. Two reviewers independently reviewed the titles, abstracts, 
and articles. Of 2481 studies identified, 203 articles met the eligibility criteria and represented 29 
countries in 6 continents.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS—One reviewer conducted a full abstraction of all 
data, and 2 reviewers verified accuracy.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Mortality estimates (eg, standardized mortality ratios, 
relative risks, hazard ratios, odds ratios, and years of potential life lost) comparing people with 
mental disorders and the general population or people without mental disorders. We used random-
effects meta-analysis models to pool mortality ratios for all, natural, and unnatural causes of death. 
We also examined years of potential life lost and estimated the population attributable risk of 
mortality due to mental disorders.
RESULTS—For all-cause mortality, the pooled relative risk of mortality among those with 
mental disorders (from 148 studies) was 2.22 (95% CI, 2.12–2.33). Of these, 135 studies revealed 
that mortality was significantly higher among people with mental disorders than among the 
comparison population. A total of 67.3% of deaths among people with mental disorders were due 
to natural causes, 17.5% to unnatural causes, and the remainder to other or unknown causes. The 
median years of potential life lost was 10 years (n = 24 studies). We estimate that 14.3% of deaths 
worldwide, or approximately 8 million deaths each year, are attributable to mental disorders.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—These estimates suggest that mental disorders rank 
among the most substantial causes of death worldwide. Efforts to quantify and address the global 
burden of illness need to better consider the role of mental disorders in preventable mortality.
Researchers have consistently reported that people with mental disorders have elevated 
mortality compared with the general population. In 1937, Malzberg1 reported that 
psychiatric inpatients had a mortality rate that was 6 times greater than the rate in the 
general population of New York. Since then, numerous studies and reviews have been 
conducted on the mortality risks of people with a variety of mental disorders2–6 and specific 
diagnoses (eg, schizophrenia,7 depression,8,9 and bipolar disorder10).
The studies11,12 on the global burden of disease illustrate the growing burden of mental 
disorders, although this burden has largely been reflected in disability rather than mortality. 
The link between mental disorders and mortality is complicated because most people with 
mental disorders do not die of their condition; rather, they die of heart disease and other 
chronic diseases, infections, suicide, and other causes.11,12 Another complicating factor is 
that mental disorders are associated with risk factors for mortality. People with mental 
disorders have high rates of adverse health behaviors, including tobacco smoking, substance 
use, physical inactivity, and poor diet. In turn, these behaviors contribute to the high rates of 
chronic medical conditions among people with mental disorders.13,14
Quantifying and understanding the excess mortality among people with mental disorders can 
inform approaches for addressing this persistent issue and widen discussion of the effect of 
mental disorders on mortality. The purpose of this study was to systematically review the

literature to examine the excess mortality rate of people with mental disorders, extending 
existing reviews of individual disorders. We sought to provide comprehensive estimates of 
individual- and population-level mortality rates related to mental disorders.
Methods
Data Sources and Searches
We followed the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiological guidelines for 
this meta-analysis.15 We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and Web of Science 
from inception through May 7, 2014. Searching was conducted by the investigators after 
consulting with a librarian about the search strategy. Our search strategy included terms for 
mental disorders (eg, mental disorders, serious mental illness, and severe mental illness), 
specific diagnoses (eg, schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder), and 
mortality. We also limited the search or included terms to identify English-language cohort 
(eg, cohort or follow-up) studies depending on the database (eTable 1 in the Supplement 
includes the full search strings). We also searched references of eligible articles and used 
Google Scholar to identify articles that cited eligible articles.
Study Selection
Studies were included if they (1) were original research papers that used a cohort study 
design; (2) included diagnosed mental disorders (eg, not symptoms); (3) reported mortality 
as an outcome by comparing people with mental disorders with a general population or 
controls from the same study setting without mental illness; and (4) were written in the 
English language. Studies were excluded if the study population was restricted to people 
with specific medical conditions (eg, heart disease) or subgroups of the population (eg, 
homeless) or the study reported duplicate data. Titles, abstracts, and articles were reviewed 
by 2 independent reviewers (E.R.W. and R.E.M.), and disagreements were settled by 
consensus.
Data Extraction
From all eligible articles, we abstracted the first author’s name, year of publication, country, 
setting, year of baseline, years of follow-up, sample source, sample size, mental disorders 
included, population of people with mental disorders (eg, inpatient, outpatient, and 
community), method of diagnosing mental disorders, diagnostic system, control or 
comparison group, and assessment of mortality. We also abstracted the observed number of 
deaths and/or rate of death among people with mental disorders (when possible, we did not 
include substance use or dementia), expected number of deaths and/or rate of death among 
people with mental disorders, risk of mortality (eg, standardized mortality ratio [SMR], 
relative risk [RR], odds ratio, hazard ratio, and years of potential life lost [YPLL]), and 
adjustment variables. All-cause mortality and mortality due to natural causes (eg, acute and 
chronic illnesses) and unnatural causes (eg, suicide and unintentional injury) were abstracted 
separately. One reviewer conducted a full abstraction of all data, and 2 reviewers (E.R.W. 
and R.E.M.) verified accuracy. We addressed study quality in 2 ways: by incorporating 
quality components, such as study design, into the study selection criteria and by including 
quality criteria as independent variables in the meta-regression. The authors of 7 studies

were contacted for information that was not included in their articles. Two emails were 
undeliverable. Of the remaining 5 researchers, 4 were able to provide information about 
numbers of deaths or YPLL.
Statistical Analysis
We compared information on study time frame, data source, and geographic location to 
identify potential sample overlap. In the case of overlap, we chose the article with the 
longest follow-up period. As a result, 54 of the studies were excluded from our analyses. An 
estimate from one study16 was excluded from the overall all-cause analyses because of 
overlap with another study,17 but it was included in the diagnosis-specific analyses. We 
included the following measures of risk: SMR, RR, odds ratio, and hazard ratio.18,19 We 
aimed to use comparably adjusted estimates across the different ratio types. The SMRs are 
typically adjusted for age and sex; therefore, if several estimates were reported, we chose the 
most basic adjusted model. For articles that reported multiple estimates by subgroup, we 
combined the ratios using the methods described by van Dooren and colleagues20 to derive 
one estimate per study for each analysis. For studies that reported multiple estimates by 
mental disorder diagnoses whose diagnoses were not mutually exclusive, we chose the 
estimate of the largest diagnostic group. For one study,21 2 ratios were included in the 
analyses because the researchers examined mortality in 2 nonoverlapping populations. One 
study22 was excluded from the analyses because the SMR was an outlier.
For the meta-analysis, mortality ratios were pooled using DerSimonian-Laird random-
effects models to allow for heterogeneity across studies.23,24 Heterogeneity was assessed 
with the Cochran Q and theI2 tests.25,26 We ran random-effects meta-regression models to 
determine which study characteristics could explain heterogeneity.26,27 We first ran each 
variable in a separate model and then ran a model with all the variables together. We also 
conducted sensitivity analyses by study quality criteria and significant variables in the meta-
regression. Potential bias was examined using the funnel plot and Egger test.28,29 We 
conducted all meta-analytic analyses on the natural log scale using STATA statistical 
software, version 12.1 (Stata Corp).
For YPLL analyses, when studies reported estimates by subgroups, we calculated a mean. 
When numbers of deaths by subgroup were available, we calculated weighted estimates of 
YPLL for people with mental disorders. Median and range of YPLL by mortality due to all 
causes, natural causes, and unnatural causes were determined.
We identified studies that included a measure of population attributable risk (PAR). We also 
calculated the number and percentage of deaths worldwide associated with mental disorders 
based on the pooled RRs and global prevalence of mental disorders. For the percentage of 
deaths attributable to mental disorders, we used the PAR formula b[(r − 1)/r], where b is the 
worldwide prevalence of mental disorders and r is the pooled RR.30 For the prevalence of all 
mental disorders and specific diagnoses, we used estimates from the World Health 
Organization World Mental Health Surveys.31,32 We calculated the approximate number of 
deaths attributable to mental disorders by multiplying the PAR by the number of deaths 
worldwide in 2012.33 The PAR and number of deaths were estimated for all-cause mortality

and for all mental disorders and specific diagnoses (eg, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, 
and psychoses).
Results
We identified 2481 articles through the literature search (Figure). Of the 1923 unique 
articles, the full text of 230 articles was reviewed, along with an additional 71 articles 
identified through hand searching and Google Scholar. Most excluded studies did not 
include a sample of people with a diagnosed mental disorder or did not report mortality 
ratios of people with mental disorders compared with an appropriate comparison group. 
Fifty-four studies were excluded because they included data that overlapped with other 
studies. A total of 203 studies met the criteria for this systematic review and were included 
in the meta-analysis.
The 203 studies were heterogeneous in terms of sample source, type of sample included, and 
comparison group. Overall descriptive data of the included studies are presented in Table 1, 
and descriptive information for each study is included in eTable 2 in the Supplement. The 
articles represented 29 countries on 6 continents. Most studies were conducted in Europe (n 
= 125), primarily Sweden (n = 30) and the United Kingdom (n = 18). The remaining studies 
were conducted in North America (United States [n = 42] and Canada [n = 9]), Asia (n = 
16), Australia (n = 8), Africa (n = 2), and South America (n = 1). Included studies mainly 
used linked registers (42.9%) to identify samples, although community-or population-based 
samples were used in 21.2% of studies. Most studies included samples of inpatients (37.4%) 
or inpatients and outpatients (26.1%). For most studies (66.5%), mental disorder diagnoses 
were identified from medical records, registers, or administrative data; diagnostic interviews 
were conducted in 24.6% of studies. Follow-up time ranged from 1 to 52 years, with a 
median of 10 years. The studies used in the following analyses are cited in eTable 3 in the 
Supplement.
Mortality
For all-cause mortality, 148 studies provided 149 RRs on the mortality of people with 
mental disorders (Table 2). Of these studies, 135 revealed that mortality among people with 
mental disorders was significantly higher than the comparison population. Fourteen studies 
(9.4%) reported no significant difference in mortality risks between the 2 groups, and no 
studies reported lower mortality risks for people with mental disorders. No patterns were 
identifiable among these 14 studies that distinguished them from the rest of the studies.
The total number of deaths, reported in 133 studies, was 338 381. The overall pooled RR for 
mortality among people with mental disorders was 2.22 (95% CI, 2.12–2.33). eFigure 1 in 
the Supplement displays the forest plot of estimates of all-cause mortality. The Cochran Q 
and I2 tests indicated a high level of heterogeneity across studies (P < .001). No significant 
bias was observed based on the funnel plot and Egger test (P = .23) (eFigure 2 in the 
Supplement). For specific diagnoses, all-cause mortality was significantly elevated for 
psychoses, mood disorders, and anxiety (Table 2). The mortality risk for psychoses was 
significantly higher than those for depression (P < .001), bipolar disorder (P = .01), and 
anxiety (P < .001).

Results from the meta-regression models with each variable entered separately provided 
evidence of differential mortality risks by population of people with mental disorders, 
method of identifying mental disorders, decade of first year of baseline, and length of 
follow-up. No differences were found in mortality risk based on sample source, diagnostic 
system, or geographic location (Asia, Europe, North America, and Africa, Australia, and 
South America grouped together). In the full meta-regression model, populations of people 
with mental disorders, length of follow-up, and first year of baseline remained significant. 
Compared with studies that included inpatients, studies that included outpatients (P = .03) 
and studies that included community- or population-based samples (P = .04) were associated 
with smaller effects. Studies with a follow-up of more than 10 years were associated with 
lower mortality risks compared with studies with shorter follow-up lengths (P = .02). 
Studies with a first year of baseline during the 1990s were associated with stronger effects 
compared with studies with a first year of baseline before 1970 (P = .009). Table 2 lists the 
pooled RRs from the stratified analyses for each of these variables separately.
The analysis of natural causes of death included 100 studies and resulted in a pooled RR of 
1.80 (95% CI, 1.71–1.88). For unnatural causes, the pooled RR from 106 studies was 7.22 
(95% CI, 6.43–8.12). Across the 86 studies that reported number of deaths, 213 773 deaths 
occurred from natural causes. A total of 46 051 deaths occurred from unnatural causes 
across the 91 studies that reported number of deaths by unnatural causes. Fifty-seven studies 
reported the number of deaths for all, natural, and unnatural causes. From these studies, we 
estimate that 67.3% of deaths were due to natural causes and 17.5% were due to unnatural 
causes, with the remainder being unknown or unidentified.
Years of Potential Life Lost
Twenty-four studies included estimates of life expectancy or YPLL for people with mental 
disorders (eTable 4 in the Supplement). Results from all these studies indicated that people 
with mental disorders had more YPLL compared with people in the general population. For 
all-cause mortality, the reduction in life expectancy ranged from 1.4 to 32 years, with a 
median of 10.1 years (n = 22 studies). The YPLL ranged from 3 to 26.3 years for natural 
causes (n = 8 studies; median, 9.6 years) and 8.4 to 41.2 years for unnatural causes (n = 4 
studies; median, 21.6 years).
Population Attributable Risk
Four studies34–37 in the systematic review included a PAR estimate. For all-cause deaths, 
the PAR was estimated at 1.3% for schizophrenia34 and 12.7% for depression.37 Among 
suicides, reported PAR estimates were 8.9% for schizophrenia,34 11.2% for depression,35 
4.8% for manic-depressive disorders,35 and 7.7% for severe mental illness.36
The overall PAR estimate and number of deaths by diagnosis based on the meta-analysis 
results are given in Table 3. According to the World Health Organization World Mental 
Health Surveys, the median lifetime prevalence of any mental disorder across 17 countries is 
26.1%. On the basis of this prevalence and the pooled RR from the meta-analysis, 
approximately 8 million deaths worldwide are attributable to mental disorders each year.

Mood disorders and anxiety disorders have similar PARs, which are much higher than the 
PARs for psychoses.
Discussion
We conducted a meta-analysis to examine mortality among people with mental disorders 
across a range of diagnoses. People with mental disorders have a mortality rate that is 2.22 
times higher than the general population or people without mental disorders, with a decade 
of YPLL. Our results align with other reviews, including a meta-review by Chesney and 
colleagues6 and a meta-analysis of depression by Cuijpers and Smit.8 In contrast to earlier 
work, our study provides individual- and population-based estimates of mortality due to 
mental disorders. The PAR due to mental disorders is estimated at 14.3%, which indicates 
that annually 8 million deaths worldwide can be attributable to mental disorders.
This is the most comprehensive meta-analysis of mortality related to mental disorders of 
which we are aware. Results included 203 studies that were conducted in 29 countries. A 
wide range of samples, diagnoses, and populations of people with mental disorders were 
examined, which contributed to the substantial heterogeneity across studies. The full meta-
regression model included several factors that shed light on variability across study 
characteristics and subpopulations.
Length of follow-up was associated with differential risks of mortality; studies with longer 
follow-up tended to report lower mortality ratios compared with studies with a follow-up of 
10 or fewer years. One explanation may be that people with mental illness die earlier and 
that, during a long follow-up, the background rate of mortality among people without mental 
illness starts to catch up with people with mental illness as the whole sample ages. The other 
study characteristics—sample source, methods of assessing mental disorders, and diagnostic 
system—were not significantly associated with mortality. However, we also found 
differential mortality rates by setting and first year of baseline.
Inpatients had significantly higher mortality rates compared with samples with outpatients 
and with community-based samples. The elevated mortality in inpatients is not surprising 
because inpatients tend to have more advanced psychiatric and general medical conditions 
than outpatients.38 Although inpatient samples may be most useful when looking to target 
the population with the greatest mortality burden, community-based samples are essential 
for examining the overall burden of mental disorders. Examining both types of studies in 
conjunction can help provide these perspectives on the mortality burden associated with 
mental disorders.
Higher mortality rates were found among more recent studies (Table 2), particularly those 
with a first year of baseline in the 1990s compared with before 1970. These results extend 
the findings by Saha and colleagues,7 who found that the mortality gap between people with 
schizophrenia and the general population has been increasing over time. Our results indicate 
that the mortality gap may apply to people with a variety of mental disorders and not only 
schizophrenia. It appears that people with mental disorders are not experiencing the 
increased life expectancy of the general population.

Examining individual-level measures, such as RR, and population-based measures, such as 
YPLL and estimated PAR, provides important and distinct perspectives on the excess 
mortality associated with mental disorders. The PAR reveals the high global burden of 
mortality associated with mental disorders, thus pointing to the importance of addressing 
mental illness along with more proximal causes of death. For specific diagnoses, whereas 
pooled RRs of mortality due to psychoses are significantly higher compared with depression 
and anxiety, depression and anxiety contribute to more deaths overall compared with 
psychoses because of their high base prevalence. Successfully reducing the mortality burden 
of mental disorders will require attention to less common but more severe illnesses and more 
prevalent but milder conditions.
Similarly, although RRs for unnatural causes of death were higher compared with those of 
natural causes of death, natural causes accounted for more than two-thirds of deaths among 
people with mental disorders. These findings suggest that a variety of approaches are 
necessary to address different causes of death among people with mental disorders. Efforts 
to reduce unnatural causes of death, such as suicide, need to focus on high-risk populations 
with mental disorders. However, efforts to reduce the excess burden of mortality among 
people with mental disorders need to also address the problem of natural causes, including 
cardiovascular disease, particularly as populations age. Differential mortality in people with 
mental disorders most likely stems from a number of causes, including behavioral and 
lifestyle factors, access to and quality of health care, and social determinants of health, such 
as poverty and social connectedness.13,14
Milstein and colleagues39 laid out a 3-pronged strategy for reducing avoidable deaths in the 
general population that involves expanding access to care, providing better preventive and 
chronic care, and enabling healthier behaviors and safer environments. These approaches are 
also applicable for people with mental disorders. Prevention aimed at reducing mental 
disorders and chronic medical conditions is crucial.40 In addition, evidence-based strategies 
for suicide prevention for people with mental disorders include physician education for 
diagnosing mental disorders and provision of quality mental health treatment.41,42 
Prevention and care of chronic medical conditions among people with mental disorders 
require promotion of healthy behaviors, early diagnosis and coordinated management, and 
integrated care between the mental health and medical systems. People with mental 
disorders often do not receive preventive services, such as immunizations, cancer 
screenings, and tobacco counseling,43 and often receive a lower quality of care for medical 
conditions.14,44
Our results must be considered in light of several limitations. First, we searched for 
published English-language studies; therefore, some studies may have been missed. 
However, given the number of studies included in our analysis, it is unlikely that the results 
would be substantially affected. Second, the broad range of included studies resulted in a 
large amount of heterogeneity that could not be fully explained by the variables we assessed. 
Third, we were unable to specifically examine excess mortality due to substance use 
disorders; future work should examine the excess mortality associated with primary or 
comorbid substance use conditions. Fourth, the PAR and number of deaths attributable to 
mental disorders are estimates based on the best epidemiologic studies available on global

mental health. The use of lifetime prevalence of mental disorders in the PAR estimate may 
be susceptible to recall bias but provides a comprehensive estimate.
Conclusions
People with mental disorders experience a high burden of mortality at the individual and 
population levels. Reduction of this burden will require a focus on less prevalent but more 
severe diagnoses and more common mental disorders. Likewise, efforts must be made to 
prevent and manage comorbid medical conditions and reduce the occurrence of unnatural 
deaths in this vulnerable population.
