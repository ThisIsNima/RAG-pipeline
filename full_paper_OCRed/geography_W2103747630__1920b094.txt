Abstract:  
 
One of the most ubiquitous and long-lasting recent changes to the surface of our planet is the 
accumulation and fragmentation of plastics. Within just a few decades since mass production of plastic 
products commenced in the 1950s, plastic debris has accumulated in terrestrial environments, in the 
open ocean, on shorelines of even the most remote islands and in the deep sea. Annual clean-up 
operations, costing millions of pounds sterling, are now organized in many countries and on every 
continent. Here we document global plastics production and the accumulation of plastic waste. While 
plastics typically constitute approximately 10 per cent of discarded waste, they represent a much 
greater proportion of the debris accumulating on shorelines. 
 
Mega- and macro-plastics have accumulated in the highest densities in the Northern Hemisphere, 
adjacent to urban centres, in enclosed seas and at water convergences (fronts). We report lower 
densities on remote island shores, on the continental shelf seabed and the lowest densities (but still a 
documented presence) in the deep sea and Southern Ocean. The longevity of plastic is estimated to 
be hundreds to thousands of years, but is likely to be far longer in deep sea and non-surface polar 
environments. Plastic debris poses considerable threat by choking and starving wildlife, distributing 
non-native and potentially harmful organisms, absorbing toxic chemicals and degrading to micro-
plastics that may subsequently be ingested. Well-established annual surveys on coasts and at sea 
have shown that trends in mega- and macro-plastic accumulation rates are no longer uniformly 
increasing: rather stable, increasing and decreasing trends have all been reported. The average size 
of plastic particles in the environment seems to be decreasing, and the abundance and global 
distribution of micro-plastic fragments have increased over the last few decades. However, the 
environmental consequences of such microscopic debris are still poorly understood.

1. INTRODUCTION
In the last half century there have been many drastic changes on the surface of the planet, but 
one of the most instantly observable is the ubiquity and abundance of plastic debris.  Like many 
anthropogenic impacts on natural systems, it is one that, despite widespread recognition of the 
problem, is still growing and even if stopped immediately will persist for centuries.  From what 
started as a perceived aesthetic problem of plastics littering towns, countryside, shores and even 
far out into the ocean soon emerged as causing the choking and entanglement of wildlife.  The 
number of potentially harmful implications of plastic debris that have been identified has 
escalated and it is now realised that these items may also transport persistent organic pollutants 
(POPs – Mato et al. 2001), non-indigenous species to new locations (Barnes 2002) and 
distribute algae associated with red tides (Maso et al. 2003).  Reports of accumulation of plastics 
spread rapidly in terms of the taxa influenced, geography and bathymetry of affected sites, and 
countries beginning monitoring and beach clean-up operations.  Schools and voluntary 
organisations have made annual coastal collections of stranded plastics an important educational 
issue even on many of the planet’s most remote islands.  In some areas though, notably on the 
sea-bed, assessment of plastic accumulation has been relatively neglected (Goldberg 1994).  
Since 1990, the dumping of rubbish at sea from ships has been prohibited under the international 
shipping regulation MARPOL annex V.  A reduction of ship derived plastic debris should 
therefore be expected, even if global use of plastics continues to increase.  To gain an accurate 
and meaningful assessment of plastics and their influence, large scale and long-term monitoring 
is needed across debris sizes (here termed mega [>1 cm diameter], macro [1-10 mm] and micro 
[>1 mm]), countries and environments, including the sea floor (see Ryan et al. this volume).  
Natural marine debris of some type (e.g. pumice) has floated on the surface of the global 
ocean for longer than life itself, but life greatly increased this through floating algae, shells, 
seeds, fruits and wood.  Human activities and travel by water must have further greatly 
increased flotsam (e.g. by timber) but by far the biggest change in the potential for transport by 
debris came with the mass production of plastics.  The accumulation of both macro- and 
microplastics, has consistently increased on shores and in sediments for the last four decades 
(see Barnes 2005 and Thompson et al. 2004, respectively).  Their inexpensive, lightweight and 
durable properties have made plastic much more single use and ‘throw-away’ than previous 
synthetic artefacts.  Such compounds do deteriorate in Ultra Violet (UV) light but haline 
environments and the cooling effect of the sea mean degradation requires very long exposure 
times (Gregory 1999).  Because plastics become fouled by marine organisms relatively quickly, 
the debris may also become shielded to some extent from UV and the persistence of this debris

was recently illustrated by accounts that plastic swallowed by an albatross had originated from a 
plane shot down 60 years previously some 9600 km away (Weiss et al. 2006).  
Mega-debris at sea was highlighted by tens of thousands of each of basketball shoes, 
hockey gloves and bath-toys released from containers washed off of ships (Weiss et al. 2006).  
There are many sources for plastics accumulating in the environment from direct dropping and 
dumping of litter on land or at sea to blowing from landfill sites, losses in transport and 
accidents.  Typically 40-80% of mega- and macro-marine debris items are plastic, much of it 
packaging, carrier bags, footwear, cigarette lighters and other domestic items (Derraik 2002; 
Barnes 2005).  A recent study by Ivar do Sul & Costa (2007) across Central and South America 
also found marine debris dominated by land-based plastic (though sometimes fishery gear can 
be abundant along continental shores as well).  At more remote islands, fishing related sources 
of debris are often more prevalent.  Following establishment of ‘long term’ monitoring surveys 
of stranded debris in the 1990s, there are now sufficient data to explore seasonal, annual and 
longer-term patterns (see e.g. Morishige et al. 2007).
Most waste plastics, including the large proportion used in single-use applications such 
as packaging, are disposed of in landfill sites.  However plastic persists in landfill sites and if not 
properly buried may later surface to become ‘debris’.  Durability of plastic ensures that 
wherever it is, it does not ‘go-away’; that is by placing plastics in landfill we may simply be 
storing a problem for the future.  Although accumulation of plastics on land is important, little 
information is available on the amounts, rates, fate or impacts whereas there has been a major 
effort to quantify impacts on shorelines and at sea.  In this paper, we examine waste generation 
and disposal, together with the abundance, composition and fragmentation of plastic.  We then 
consider temporal and spatial trends in accumulation of plastics on strandlines, the sea surface 
and at depth on the sea-bed.  We assess published data and present new surveys and 
observations of spatial and temporal patterns to evaluate whether persistent marine debris, such 
as plastics, are still increasing and whether it varies geographically?  
2.  ANTHROPOGENIC WASTE AND PLASTIC ACCUMULATION IN LANDFILL
Plastics are present in most waste and before trends in accumulation of plastic can be explained 
it is important to first consider waste generation and disposal.  Global production of plastics is 
estimated at 225 m.t.year-1 (APME 2006).  Waste composition data are useful to identify the 
relative quantity and types of plastic.   As discussed in the contribution by Takada et al. (this 
volume), different plastics and resins have widely varying properties with respect to 
contaminant sorption and desorption.

(a) waste generation
Waste is typically categorized based on its point of generation.  Categories include municipal, 
commercial, industrial, agricultural, and construction and demolition (C&D).  However, there is 
ambiguity within these categories.  For example, in the U.S., municipal solid waste (MSW) 
includes that generated in residential, commercial and institutional (e.g. schools, government 
offices) sectors, while in other countries MSW may include anything from residential waste 
only to all waste managed in the municipal system (e.g. C&D, non-hazardous industrial).  This 
complexity is exacerbated by the fact that some municipal systems manage residual materials 
from the treatment of water and wastewater.  This relatively heavy waste will distort the 
composition of dry wastes such as plastics.  
Considering these multiple categories, it is difficult to compare waste composition between 
countries.  Waste is typically classified by the agency in need of the information and surveys are 
typically designed with specific goals.  For example, a waste sort conducted to support planning 
of a recycling programme would identify commonly recycled plastics including pigmented and 
translucent high density polyethylene (HDPE) containers, clear and pigmented polyethylene 
terephthalate (PET), and classify the remaining plastics as “other.”  These categories are useful 
in this (recycling) context but are less complete for a study of plastics in the environment.  
Another confounding issue is that the types of plastics present vary between municipal, 
agricultural and C&D waste.  Municipal waste is dominated by containers (e.g. drink bottles) 
and films (e.g. carrier bags, packaging sheets), agricultural waste may contain large quantities of 
a single film, and C&D waste may contain polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe and large plastic 
containers.  Thus, a municipal stream that contains 10% (by mass) plastics is not equivalent to a 
C&D stream containing the same percentage.
Waste composition may also be presented on either an “as generated” or “as discarded” 
basis.  The former includes all the waste generated in a particular sector, prior to separation for 
recycling, composting, or other treatment.  In contrast, “as discarded” indicates the waste 
remaining for disposal after the aforementioned separation.  In areas with significant recycling 
programmes, the difference between waste generation and waste disposal could be 20 to 40%, 
and waste composition will change as recyclables are removed.  If properly managed at the end 
of its useful life, plastic waste may be recycled, burned in combustion facilities to generate 
energy, or buried in landfill.  In each of these alternatives, the waste should be destroyed or 
contained, so that plastic is not released to the environment. The major release of plastics to the 
environment is the result of inappropriate waste management and improper human behaviour

e.g. littering (deliberately abandoning waste away from collection points).  For example, plastic 
films can be released to the environment when not transported properly, and as a result of wind 
blown litter at the point of burial in a landfill.  Well-operated landfills include a daily cover over 
the waste consisting of soil or a synthetic material, and fences surrounding the landfill to contain 
wind blown debris.
(b) Plastics production and recycling
Annual global consumption of the major plastic resins is considerable (see Andrady & Neal, this 
volume).  Films (e.g. carrier bags, plastic sheets) are easiest to escape containment as wind-
blown debris and are likely the major component of terrestrial plastic litter but plastic litter also 
includes discarded fishing equipment, food and beverage packaging, and many other items that 
are present in the marine environment (Koutsodendris et al., 2008).  Films are dominated by 
LDPE/LLDPE.  We present information on plastics in MSW in the U.S. and their management 
(Table 1).  The quantities recovered (i.e. for recycling) as a fraction of total discards shows that 
recycling rates are relatively low.  In the U.S., plastic recycling is largely limited to drink 
containers though local authorities continue to expand the types of plastics collected for 
recycling.  In general, citizen participation rather than industrial capacity limits the quantities of 
plastics recycled.  Efforts to provide incentives for recycling can increase the fraction recycled 
(Loughlin & Barlaz 2006).
In the US durable goods, products that last on average for more than three years and include 
items such as furniture and appliances, were the most important use for new plastics (Figure 1). 
Non-durable goods, products that are consumed in less than three years such as trash bags and 
eating utensils were the next biggest use category.  In Europe, data on various packaging 
applications are typically combined rather than considered separately and hence disposable 
packaging represents the principal use of plastics (37%, Plastics Europe, 2008).
(c) The fraction of plastic in household waste
Plastics in the waste from various countries is estimated at about 10% (of mass).  Such estimates 
can only be used as an indication of plastics composition for several reasons.  First, the data are 
not all from the same year.  Second, where possible, data are on an “as discarded” basis to 
reflect the composition of waste after diversion for recycling.  However, it is not always clear 
whether the data were reported “as generated” or “as discarded.”  Third, the waste components 
included in national surveys vary within and between countries.  For example, the U.S. data are 
for wastes defined as MSW.  Finally, country-specific data compiled for Europe (Eurostat 2007)

are self-reported at the national level and are unlikely to have been generated using a consistent 
methodology.  In the U.S., plastics are estimated to comprise 11.8 and 16.3% of MSW as 
generated and as discarded mass, respectively.  The composition of discarded plastics is given in 
Table 1 (U.S. EPA 2006).  In Europe, plastics are estimated to comprise 7% of waste mass as 
generated.  Similarly, plastics were estimated to represent 5.8, 7.3, 8 to 10, and 10% of waste 
mass in Singapore, Australia, the UK, and Finland, respectively (Barlaz 2006; Burnley 2007; 
Sokka et al. 2007).  Finally, plastics were estimated to comprise 4 and 13% of waste in regions 
of China that use coal and natural gas, respectively, and the country-wide average for urban 
areas is projected to be 14% plastics in 2030  (World Bank 2005).  Despite the uncertainty, 
estimates from around the world are reasonably consistent in estimating plastics to comprise 
about 10% of municipal waste mass.  In contrast, plastics comprise 50-80% of the waste 
stranded on beaches, floating on the ocean surface and on the seabed (Gregory & Ryan 1997; 
Derraik 2002; Barnes 2005; Morishige et al. 2007).
3. TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL TRENDS IN ACCUMULATION
(a) Ocean surface and beaches
Many plastics are buoyant (46% US EPA 2006) and remain so until they become waterlogged or 
amass too much epibiota to float.  Plastic items are commonly found at the sea surface or 
washed up on the shoreline.  Mass production of plastics began in the 1950s, so less than a 
century ago we estimate the amount of anthropogenic debris at sea would have been three to 
four orders of magnitude lower and restricted to much more degradable items. Some of the 
earliest accounts of plastic debris in the marine environment are of fragments and pellets 
ingested by seabirds in the 1960’s (e.g. Kenyon & Kridler 1969, Harper & Fowler 1987), but 
now plastic mega- and macro-debris is routinely observed from boats everywhere on the planet.  
There has been a rapid and substantial increase in anthropogenic debris on the ocean surface and 
beaches over recent decades (e.g. Dixon & Dixon 1981, Derraik 2002, Barnes 2005), but of 
more pertinence now are the current spatial trends.  Surveys of anthropogenic debris and clean-
up operations have generally focussed on the larger items along strandlines, and there is a wide 
geographic variability in the type of data available to examine potential trends.  However in the 
last three of decades it has become apparent that the raw material for making plastics, tiny 
pellets, and microplastics have become more numerous (as marine debris) and, like larger 
pieces, these can travel considerable distances.  Volunteer observations and collections in a

growing number of nations are aiding our understanding of the scale and pattern of distribution 
of macro- and megaplastics in the marine environment but specialist examination is generally 
needed to investigate accumulation of microplastic, e.g., in sediments (see Thompson et al. 
2005).  Beaches are the most easily accessible areas for studying marine debris (although such 
studies have some confounding factors), yet despite the establishment of many study sites, 
irregularity of sampling, differing protocol and observers have led to very few data sets 
spanning more than a decade (see Barnes & Milner 2005). 
The distribution of plastic debris is very patchy at sea for a variety of reasons, including 
local wind and current conditions, coastline geography and the points of entry into the system 
such as urban areas and trade routes.  For example, stranding of macro- and megaplastics is 
between one and two orders of magnitude less per length of coastline on remote shores and at 
large spatial scales abundance correlates very strongly (Pearson’s correlation = 0.971, P<0.001) 
with human population (per 10 degree latitude, see Barnes 2005).  Enclosed seas and semi-
enclosed seas such as the Caribbean (Coe et al. 1997), typically have high densities of plastic 
debris but also considerable variability.  High densities and variability can also be a feature of 
open ocean coastlines e.g., Brasil (Santos et al. 2005) and Hawaii (Dameron et al. 2007).  One 
of the key sources of interannual variability seems to be changes in oceanic circulation driven by 
El Niňo events (Matsumura & Nasu 1997; Morishige et al. 2007).  Typically about 2000 and 
500 items of anthropogenic debris strand on north and south Atlantic Ocean shores 
(respectively) per linear km per year of which more than half is plastic (scaled up from surveys 
of items >1cm in size along 200 m long beach sections, see Barnes & Milner 2005).  More than 
six times as much plastic strands in the Mediterranean Sea and less than six times as much 
strands in the Southern Ocean shores (see Barnes & Milner 2005, Table 2).  Despite 
considerable variability in observation and accumulation rates of plastic debris, some temporal 
trends do emerge.  Studies initiated in the 1980s and 1990s indicated that the rate of plastic 
stranding from oceanic sources showed a sustained and considerable increase over time (e.g., 
Ryan & Moloney 1993; Ribic et al. 1997; Torres & Jorquera 1999).  Similarly the occurrence of 
macro-plastics associated with wildlife (e.g., in bird nests and stomachs, entangling seals, 
strangling a wide variety of vertebrates or even used by hermit crabs instead of shells, see 
Barnes 2005) also drastically increased.  For example, between 1992 and 2005 the frequency of 
plastic garbage items in Kittiwake nests increased from 39.3% to 57.2% in Northwest Denmark 
(Hartwig et al. 2007).  Monitoring of strandings and effects on megafauna (such as birds) has 
now commenced on at least a few remote island shores in every ocean and these, with negligible 
local sources of plastics, have revealed the scale at which anthropogenic debris is accumulating.

Barnes (2005) found high levels but no consistent temporal trends in the abundance of 
anthropogenic debris on northern hemisphere shores compared to much lower levels but 
increased densities through the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s were reported in the Southern 
hemisphere.  The highest increases were at high southern latitudes (see Barnes 2005).  However 
new data (reported here) show that patterns of stranding on islands is no longer clearly 
increasing and may be stabilising, though often with a ‘noisy’ signal of annual variability 
(Figure 2, see also Ryan et al. this volume).  A similar lack of clear temporal trend in stranding 
densities of plastics is apparent in data collected intermittently at Ascension I., in the tropical 
Atlantic Ocean, and in the Falkland Is., south Atlantic Ocean (Barnes unpublished data).  About 
27% of macro-debris items stranding at Ascension I. was fishery related, similar to remote Tern 
I. in the Hawaiian Is. (Morishige et al. 2007). This is much less than on shores adjacent to 
important fisheries e.g. in Brazil (Oigman-Pszczol & Creed 2007) or even sub-Antarctic Bird I. 
(Walker et al. 1997).  Bird I. and Signy I. in the Southern Ocean (Figure 2) have stranding 
densities of plastics an order of magnitude lower than remote localities at low latitudes, which in 
turn have at least an order of magnitude fewer plastics per km than urban sites.  Further south in 
the Southern Ocean, debris washes ashore much more rarely at Adelaide Island (west Antarctic 
Peninsula).  The relatively consistent level of abundance for macro and mega-debris at sea at 
high southern latitudes is supported by recent resurveys around the Drake Passage, Scotia arc 
and northern Antarctic Peninsula (Figure 3).  Fifteen years after the first (see Barnes & Milner 
2005), the most recent survey of this area took place early in 2008 and will involve the first 
marine debris surveys of the south Bellingshausen and Amundsen seas.  Visual surveys such as 
these are weaker as a source of data than surface towed trawls but much more common and thus 
arguably comparable with data collected elsewhere, despite being semi quantitative.  Gregory et 
al. (1984) reported similarly low (on a global scale) levels of floating anthropogenic debris in 
the Ross Sea (Pacific sector) of the Southern Ocean.  Observers from the University of Essex in 
conjunction with Greenpeace are currently undertaking repeat survey of plastics at sea in this
area.  As on surrounding strandlines, the North Atlantic and Pacific oceans have high densities 
of floating plastic debris, especially at 20-40º N within a few hundred km of the coast and in the 
gyre centres, e.g. between the tropical and subarctic waters (see Matsumura & Nasu 1997).  A 
recent (2005) survey of the subtropical convergence zone in this area showed plastic debris to be 
concentrating there remotely using satellite imagery (Pichel et al. 2007). 
We know much less about the use by and distribution of organisms that hitch-hike on

reproductive viability.  The high abundance, lengthy durability and travel of plastics to even the 
most remote coasts, makes them a major potential vector for the dispersal of organisms (see 
Gregory this volume).  New data from surveys of marine debris stranding in the Seychelles in 
2005 and 2006 showed that on some beaches more than 60% of items carried fouling organisms, 
the highest reported anywhere (D. Barnes unpublished data).  This is of significance because the 
prevailing currents travel from N. Australia and S. Indonesia during summer (South Equatorial) 
and from Somalia, India and N. Indonesia during winter (Indian Monsoon) could potentially 
transport a very wide range of species to less biodiverse, mid-ocean islands.  Recent surveys of 
marine debris at Ascension I. (reported here for the first time) found 38, 40 and 41% of debris 
colonised by fauna in 2002, 2003 and 2005 respectively.  Much of this had probably also 
travelled considerable distances given the prevailing currents come from the cape of South 
Africa.  The likely response of many species to rapid regional warming is to move pole-ward to 
stay within their normal thermal envelope but in previous phases of warming (interglacial 
periods) there were few vectors to travel on.  Now plastic debris, ship hulls and other vectors 
make transport more rapid and frequent and unprecedented warming at high latitudes also means 
that establishment success of potential invaders is likely to be higher.    
(b) Seabeds from shallows to abyss
As at the surface, both in the open ocean and on strandlines it is clear that the abundance and 
distribution of anthropogenic debris shows considerable spatial variability.  The geographical 
distribution of plastic debris is strongly influenced by hydrodynamics, geomorphology and 
human factors. Moreover, there is notable temporal, particularly seasonal, variation with a 
tendency for accumulation and concentration along coastal and particular geographic areas.
Under the weight of fouling by a wide variety of bacteria, algae, animals and 
accumulated sediment, plastics can sink to the seabed (RCT unpublished data).  Change in the 
nature, presence or abundance of anthropogenic debris on the sea floor is much less widely 
investigated than surface patterns.  Studies that investigate seabed debris typically focus on 
continental shelves and research into the deeper seabed, which forms about half the planet’s 
surface, is restricted by sampling difficulties and cost.  Patterns in even the shallow subtidal can 
differ substantially from the adjacent strandlines.  Oigman-Pszczol & Creed (2007) found plastic 
to constitute a much greater proportion of debris on the nearshore Brazilian seabed than on the 
shore.  While sonar does not enable discrimination of different types of debris, trawling (e.g. 
using Agassiz) is probably the most adequate method to date, particularly when mesh size and 
opening width can be manipulated (Goldberg 1994, 1995; Galgani & Andral 1998).  Such nets

are only semi-quantitative and because of their design for collecting epibenthos, probably 
underestimate the quantities of debris present. Therefore pole trawling, with a constant mouth 
width, which works deeper in sediments, is considered the best approach.  This is also the only 
trawling method with off-shelf data from submersibles.  General strategies to investigate sea-bed 
debris are similar to methodology for benthic ecology and place more emphasis on the 
abundance and nature (e.g. bags, bottles, pieces of plastics) of items rather than their mass.  
Interpretation of trends is made difficult because the ageing of plastics at depth is not well 
researched and the fall of plastics to the sea-bed began long before specific scientific 
investigations started in the 1990s.  Plastics have been found on the seabed of all seas and 
oceans across the planet but macro-debris is still very rare in the Southern Ocean, particularly in 
deep water.  For example a recent series of 32 Agassiz trawls and 29 Epibenthic sledge tows (at 
200-1500 m depth, BAS unpublished data) around the most (human) visited area, the northern 
Antarctic Peninsula and Scotia arc, found just one plastic piece and one metal shot.  Large-scale 
evaluations of sea-bed debris distribution and densities anywhere are scarce (but see Galgani et 
al. 2000; Lee et al. 2006; Koutsodendris et al. 2008).  However, there are a large number of 
smaller scale studies that have investigated anthropogenic debris in coastal areas such as bays, 
estuaries and sounds (see table 2 and references therein).
The abundance of plastic debris is very dependent upon location with values ranging 
from 0-7290 items per hectare (Ha)  (although an extreme find of 10110 anthropogenic items 
per Ha was found in 1998 at one position, 43º42.84’N, 7º22.98’E using a pole trawl).  
Assessments of abundance clearly demonstrate the domination of this debris by plastics, as at 
more than half the study sites plastics constituted >50% of debris (Table 2).  Of the areas 
investigated to date, Mediterranean sites tend to show the greatest densities due to the 
combination of a densely populated coastline and shipping in coastal waters, and a lack of 
dispersion of plastics by little tidal flow or water circulation. In general, bottom debris tends to 
become trapped in areas of low circulation and high sediment accumulation in contrast to 
floating debris, which accumulates in frontal areas.  Debris that reaches the sea-bed may already 
have been transported considerable distance, only sinking when weighed down by fouling. The 
consequence is an accumulation of plastics debris in bays rather than the open sea (Hess et al. 
1999; Stefatos et al. 1999).  Some accumulation zones in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean 
Seas have very high debris densities despite being far from coasts.  These densities relate to the 
consequence of large-scale residual ocean circulation patterns.  There are higher densities in 
particular areas such as around rocks and wrecks or in depressions or channels (Galgani et al. 
1996).  In the North Sea (Figure 4), accumulation of plastics 320 km offshore from Denmark

(Galgani et al. 2000) is a consequence of several factors.  These include the eddying circulation 
in the central north sea (Delhez & Martin 1992) and long-term circulation of water from the gulf 
stream transporting plastics northwards (Breton & Salomon 1995) and to the convergence zone 
of seabed sediment movements, due to local decreases of turbidity and turbulence (Tappin et al. 
1997).   
Large rivers are responsible for substantial inputs of debris to the sea bed (Williams & 
Simmons 1997).  They can transport waste out to sea because of their high flow rate and the 
strength of bottom currents.  In smaller rivers the displacement is slight, and waste can be found 
in zones adjacent to or in the estuaries and is often coincident with fronts (Acha et al. 2003). 
Patterns of debris transport should therefore be linked to river flow strength and may follow 
similar patterns to deposition of sediment load (often depositing only small amounts of material 
immediately along the coast).  
Deep submarine extensions of coastal rivers also influence the distribution of sea bed 
debris.  In some areas local water movements transport plastics away from the coast to 
accumulate in zones of high sedimentation. In these conditions, the distal deltas of rivers can fan 
out in deeper waters, creating areas of high accumulation (Galgani et al. 1996). Continental 
shelves often have lower concentrations of debris since most of the anthropogenic debris in the 
outer shelf originates from coasts to shelves that are washed offshore by currents associated with 
river plumes.  Data from the shelf areas off the River Rhone (Galgani et al. 1995b) and 
California (Moore & Allen 2000) show circulation can be strongly, locally influenced by storm 
water events.  The accumulation of plastics in coastal canyons may also be related to strong 
currents occurring in the upper part of canyons, which decrease rapidly in deeper areas resulting 
from increased confinement. Accordingly, debris distribution seems to be more temporally 
stable.  An inevitable effect of this is the presence of greater amounts of debris in deeper shelf 
waters than in coastal waters (Galgani et al. 1996, 2000). 
A wide variety of human activities contribute to these patterns of sea-bed debris 
distribution, including proximity to fishing activities, urban development and tourism.  Also 
with plastic as a main component, debris from the fishing industry is prevalent in fishing areas 
(Kanehiro et al.1995; Galgani et al. 2000). This type of material accounts for a high percentage 
of debris, for example up to 72 % in eastern China Sea (Lee et al. 2006) and 65% in the Celtic 
sea (Galgani et al. 2000).  Of sea-bed marine debris in California fishing gear also occupied 
more space than plastic, metal, and miscellaneous debris (Moore & Allen 2000).  
Investigations using submersibles at depths beyond the continental shelf usually consider 
the number of items per linear km because of variability in transect width. They have revealed

substantial quantities of debris (Fig 5).  Besides the high densities found in coastal canyons (up 
to 112 items km-1 and 70 % plastics), plastics and other anthropogenic debris were found widely 
dispersed at slope and abyssal depths (Galgani et al. 2000).  Deployment of a Remotely 
Operated Vehicle submarine in the Fram Strait (Arctic) (Galgani & Lecornu 2004) revealed 0.2-
0.9 pieces of plastic per linear km at Hausgarten (2500 m).  On dives between 5500 and 6770 m, 
15 items of debris were observed, of which 13 were plastic, probably carried there by the 
Norwegian current in the North Atlantic. At such latitude and bathymetry there is negligible 
human activity, suggesting long distance transport of debris.  Even more than on the sea surface 
or strandlines of remote locations, such as in the Southern Ocean, accumulation trends in the 
deep sea are of special concern. Most polymers are highly persistent in the marine environment 
and only degrade slowly via photocatalysis when exposed to ultra-violet radiation (Andrady 
2003).  Estimates for the longevity of plastics are variable but are believed to be in the range of 
hundreds or even thousands of years depending on the physical and chemical properties of the 
polymer, but this is likely to be greatly increased at depth where oxygen concentrations are low 
and light is absent.  We know little about trends in accumulation of debris in the deep sea as 
studies are rare but the data we have indicate considerable variability.  For example in some 
areas, such as the bay of Tokyo, debris densities decreased from 1996 to 2003 (Kanehiro et al. 
1995; Kuriyama et al. 2003).  In contrast, abundance remained stable in the gulf of Lion, France 
during a similar period (Fig 6).  Furthermore in some areas around Greece the abundance of 
debris at depth has increased over the last 8 years (Stefatos et al. 1999; Koutsodendris et al. 
2008).  Interpretation of temporal trends is also complicated by annual variations in debris 
transport, such as seasonal changes in flow rate of rivers.  Other seasonal factors include 
variation in the position of water fronts, the intensity of currents, swell, winds and upwelling 
which influence both the distribution and densities. Nevertheless if we extrapolate from existing 
data, it would appear that in the Mediterranean Sea as a whole there are about 3 x 109 debris 
items (floating or sunk) of which 70-80% are plastic.  New initiatives to minimise littering and 
to reduce, re-use and recycle plastic should ultimately reduce plastic input into the at sea, 
although usage is still very high.  However, fragmentation of macro- and megaplastics to 
microplastic pieces will also contribute to future trends in the abundance of visible plastics.
4. FRAGMENTATION OF PLASTICS IN THE ENVIRONMENT
The longevity of plastics is a matter for some debate, and estimates range from hundreds to 
thousands of years. It is considered that (with the exception of materials that have been

incinerated) all of the conventional plastic that has ever been introduced into the environment 
still remains to date unmineralised either as whole items or as fragments (Thompson et al. 
2005). However, since we have only been mass-producing conventional plastics for around 60 
years it is too early to say exactly how long these materials will persist. Despite the durability of 
these polymers, plastic items are fragmenting in the environment as a consequence of prolonged 
exposure to ultraviolet light and physical abrasion (Colton et al. 1974; Gregory 1978; Andrady 
2003; Thompson et al. 2004). This is particularly evident on shorelines where photo-degradation 
and abrasion through wave action makes plastic items brittle increasing their fragmentation. 
Some of the first evidence of accumulation of plastic fragments in the environment came 
indirectly from examination of the gut contents of sea birds in the 1960’s (e.g. Kenyon & 
Kridler 1969). Later, in the early 1970’s, small fragments of plastic were observed in seawater 
collected with plankton samples from the North Sea (Buchanan 1971) and were subsequently 
reported on much broader scales in the north-western Atlantic (Colton et al. 1974). There have 
since been numerous reports of fragments in the oceans, on the seabed and on shorelines 
worldwide (Figure 7) and there is clear evidence that the abundance of these fragments is 
increasing (Figure 8). The UK Marine Conservation Society, which organises annual voluntary 
beach cleaning on shores all around the UK, reports a 30% increase in the abundance of large 
fragments (1-50cm in size) and a 20% increase in the abundance of smaller fragments (<1cm) 
between 1998 and 2006 (MCS 2007). On shorelines close to Plymouth one of us (RCT) recently 
recorded strandline material with more than 10% (10.89 ± 0.67, mean ± standard deviation) by 
weight of plastic fragments and pieces (including some plastic spherules, the raw materials for 
manufacture).  In 2004, Thompson et al. (2004) reported on the abundance of even smaller 
fragments of plastic, some just 20µm, in diameter, which had accumulated on shorelines around 
the UK.  Using plankton samples archived by the Sir Alistair Hardy Foundation for Ocean 
Science it was evident that the abundance of this microscopic debris had increased significantly 
in recent years (Figure 8). Similar fragments have since been identified from shorelines 
worldwide (Figure 7) and in terms of numerical abundance microplastic can constitute over 80% 
of intertidal plastic debris at some locations (Browne et al. 2007).
Fragments of plastic can be identified using Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) 
Spectroscopy to match spectra obtained from unknown debris items to those of known 
polymers. Using this approach a range of common polymers including polypropylene, 
polyethylene and polyester have been identified as fragments and microscopic fragments. These 
materials have a wide range of domestic and industrial uses from rope and packaging to clothing 
and it seems likely that the fragments are forming from the breakdown of a wide range of

everyday plastic products (Thompson et al. 2004). In addition to this ‘natural’ deterioration, it 
has been suggested that plastic items are also deliberately being shredded on board some ships 
in order that plastic waste can be concealed in food waste discharged at sea (van Franeker et al. 
2005). The abundance of small items of plastic is further increased by the use plastic particles as 
scrubbers and abrasives in commercial cleaning applications (Gregory 1996) and by spillage of 
pre-production plastic pellets (~ 5mm in diameter) and powders such as those used for 
rotomoulding (~ 300µm in diameter) (e.g. Carpenter et al. 1972; Colton et al. 1974; Gregory 
1978). Hence it is apparent that small items of plastic are entering the environment directly and 
that larger items of debris are fragmenting. 
The accumulation of plastic fragments is of particular concern because they are difficult 
to remove from the environment and because they have the potential to be ingested by a much 
wider range of organisms than larger items of debris. Marine mammals, turtles and numerous 
other organisms are known to ingest large items of plastic including bags and bottles (Laist 
1997; Derraik 2002). Smaller fragments can be ingested by birds, fish and even invertebrates 
(Thompson et al. 2004; Van Franeker et al. 2005). Upon ingestion it is possible that these small 
fragments may present a physical hazard in a similar way to larger items of debris by clogging 
feeding appendages or the digestive system (Laist 1997; Derraik 2002). Microscopic fragments 
are also be taken up from the gut into other body tissues (Browne et al. 2008). In addition to 
concerns about the physical hazards presented by this debris it has also been suggested that 
plastics could transfer harmful chemicals to living organisms (e.g. Oehlmann et al., Talsness et 
al. and Kock et al. all in this volume). A range of chemicals are used as additives in the 
manufacture of plastics. These increase the functionality of the plastics, but some such as 
phthalate plasticisers and brominated flame retardants are potentially harmful and have been 
associated with carcinogenic and endocrine disrupting effects (see Takada et al. this volume). In 
seawater, plastics are also known to sorb and concentrate contaminants, which have arisen in the 
environment from other sources. These contaminants include persistent organic “pollutants” 
such as PCBs DDE, nonylphenol and phenanthrene can become several orders of magnitude 
more concentrated on the surface of plastic debris than in the surrounding seawater (Mato et al. 
2001). It has been widely suggested that these sorbed contaminants and the chemicals additives 
that are used in manufacture could subsequently be released if the plastics are ingested (see 
Takada et al. this volume). Small and microscopic plastic fragments present a likely route for 
the transfer of these chemicals because they have a much greater surface area to volume ratio 
than larger items of debris from which they have originated and because of their size they are 
available to a wide range of organisms, including deposit feeders like the lug worm, Arenicola

marina, that feed by stripping organic matter from particulates (Mayer et al. 1997; Voparil et al. 
2004). Recent in-vitro modelling studies predict that even very small quantities of microplastic 
have the potential to significantly increase the transport of phenanthrene to A. marina (Teuten et 
al. 2007) and work in this volume has examined uptake of contaminants from plastics by birds 
(Takada et al this volume).
Given current levels of production and the quantities of plastic that are already present in 
the environment it seems inevitable that the abundance of plastic fragments will continue to 
increase for the foreseeable future. More work is therefore needed to model the environmental 
consequences of this debris and to produce environmental risk assessment models to predict the 
transport of a range of contaminants by fragments of common polymers (Thompson et al. 2005; 
Thompson 2006; Teuten et al. 2007).  
5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 
Less than 60 years ago, the mass production of plastics started and now most items that people 
use, virtually anywhere on the planet are partly or wholly made of this inexpensive, durable 
material.  Plastics have transformed the surface of the planet far beyond areas of human 
population density – fragments of all sizes are ubiquitous in soils to lake beds, from remote 
Antarctic island shores to tropical sea-beds.  Plastics turn up in bird nests, are worn by hermit 
crabs instead of shells and are present in turtle stomachs.  Human populations generate 
considerable amounts of waste and the quantities are increasing as standards of living and 
population also increase.  Although quantities vary between countries, about 10% of solid waste 
is plastic.  Up to 80% or sometimes more of the waste that accumulates on land, shorelines, the 
ocean surface or seabed is plastic.  The most common items are plastic films, such as carrier 
bags, which are easily wind blown as well as discarded fishing equipment and food and 
beverage packaging. Strandline surveys (beach cleaning operations) are now organised in many 
countries and provide information about temporal and spatial trends.  However, these surveys 
typically only provide data on coarse trends and larger items.  There is considerable variation in 
methodology between regions and between investigators and more valuable and comparable 
data could be obtained by standardising monitoring approaches (Ryan et al. this volume).  
Accumulation rates vary widely with many factors such as proximity of urban settlements, shore 
use, prevailing wind and ocean currents, and region.  There were dramatic increases in quantities 
of mega and macro-plastic debris in the northern hemisphere up to the 1990s.  Quantities of 
debris in the oceans appear to have stabilised in the oceans over the last decade but have 
increased on shorelines.  However this could indicate quantities of debris entering the sea are

declining, but the material already in the sea is progressively being deposited on the shore or 
sinking to the deep. .  Accumulation rates are much lower in the southern hemisphere but are 
still increasing significantly, although repeat surveys on remote Antarctic islands and ocean 
areas suggest stabilisation over the last decade.  Fouled by organisms and sediment, plastics can 
sink and form an even higher proportion of human waste reaching the seabed and quantities in 
excess of tens of thousands of items per km2 have been reported. As on beaches and the ocean 
surface, enclosed seas such as the Mediterranean have the highest densities, but investigations in 
deeper waters have shown high accumulation rates can stretch far (hundreds of km) from the 
coast, particularly adjacent to large river mouths or in canyons.  As on surface environments, 
trends of debris accumulation on the seabed increase at some locations, but are stable or 
decreasing at other sites.  Quantities of debris in the oceans appear to have stabilised in the 
oceans over the last decade but have increased on shorelines.  The problem of plastic fragments 
has taken on increased importance in the last few decades.   From the first reports in the 1970s, 
it was only a few years before the widespread finding of plastic including reports of microscopic 
fragments (20µm in diameter).  The abundance of microscopic fragments was greater in the 
1980s and 1990s was than in previous decades.  It has also been suggested that plastic waste is 
deliberately being shredded into fragments to conceal and discarded at sea.  Plastics of all sizes 
are now reaching the most remote and deepest parts of the planet and although we have much 
better knowledge of their sources, quantities, and distribution, we still understand little about 
their longevity, and affects on organisms.  Further, we have made little progress in reducing the 
release of plastic to the environment.  Temporal trends of macroplastics on remote islands 
suggest regulations to reduce dumping at sea have been successful to some extent.  However our 
sustained demand for plastic means that contamination of the environment by microplastic 
pieces seems set to increase.  In addition, future sampling may reveal increasing quantities of 
debris in the planet’s least known habitat, the deep sea.          
Acknowledgements:  The authors would like to thank past marine debris observers on beaches and ships who have 
generously given up their time and effort to recording items.  The authors would also like to thank Alison Cook for 
help in preparation of Figure 7; also Mark Brown and Stuart Niven for analysis of microplastic data in Figure 7.

Plastics were counted after 30 minutes trawl time (16 m mouth, 20 mm mesh) at 64 stations (●) 
on the continental shelf.  Results are given as items per Ha (10,000 m2).
Figure 5 Accumulation of debris in deep sea environments. Submersible observations in 
Mediterranean canyons (A & B: plastic bottles at 1000 m depth at two different locations in the 
Marseille canyon, 43°03”.00N 05°00”.00 E) and above the polar circle, under ice floe (C & D: 
individual plastic bags, 2200-2600 m depth at Hausgarten, Fram strait, 79°03”.80 N 04°11”.60 
E ).
Figure 6  Plastic debris on the sea floor from the Gulf of Lion (Mediterranean Sea , France) 
between 1994 and 2004. Plastics were counted after 60 minutes trawl time (net = 16 m mouth, 
10 mm mesh) at 65 stations (●) located on the continental shelf and adjacent canyons (down to 
800m) from the gulf.  Results are given as items per Ha (10,000 m2).

on shoreline (size not specified); 14, (Eriksson & Burton 2003) fragments (≥1mm) in scats of 
fur seals; 15, (Kusui & Noda 2003) fragments (≥1mm) on beaches;  16, (Thompson et al. 2004)
Microplastics (≥20µm) in surface waters and on beaches; 17, (Endo et al. 2005) resin pellets 
(~5mm) on beaches; 18, (Reddy et al. 2006) microplastics (≥10µm) on shorelines near ship 
breaking yards; 19, (Ng & Obbard 2006) Microplastics in surface waters and sediments

Figure 8  Microscopic plastic in surface waters, collected with Continuous Plankton Recorder, 
revealed a significant increase in abundance when samples from the 1960s and 1970s were 
compared with the 1980s and 1990s (* = F 3,3 = 14.42, P < 0.05). Global production of plastic 
overlain for comparison (APME 2006). Adapted from Thompson et al. (2004).
