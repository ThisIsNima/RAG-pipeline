regional mantle response. For sites far from the ice
sheets, the primary contribution is from the region-
al response to the change in water load, although
there remains a component of global ﬂow in re-
sponse to the distant glacial unloading, and the
resulting viscosity estimate will partly reﬂect man-
tle conditions beneath the ice sheets. Likewise, for
sites near the rebound centers, the response will be
largely determined by the mantle beneath the ice
load, but there will remain a smaller component
that is determined by mantle conditions further
away. Thus, although the regional results should
indicate whether lateral variation is likely to be
important, they will not lead to deﬁnitive values.

Trends, Rhythms, and Aberrations in
Global Climate 65 Ma to Present
James Zachos,1* Mark Pagani,1 Lisa Sloan,1 Ellen Thomas,2,3 Katharina Billups4
Since 65 million years ago (Ma), Earth’s climate has undergone a signiﬁ-
cant and complex evolution, the ﬁner details of which are now coming to
light through investigations of deep-sea sediment cores. This evolution
includes gradual trends of warming and cooling driven by tectonic pro-
cesses on time scales of 105 to 107 years, rhythmic or periodic cycles
driven by orbital processes with 104- to 106-year cyclicity, and rare rapid
aberrant shifts and extreme climate transients with durations of 103 to
105 years. Here, recent progress in deﬁning the evolution of global climate
over the Cenozoic Era is reviewed. We focus primarily on the periodic and
anomalous components of variability over the early portion of this era, as
constrained by the latest generation of deep-sea isotope records. We also
consider how this improved perspective has led to the recognition of
previously unforeseen mechanisms for altering climate.
Through study of sedimentary archives, it
has become increasingly apparent that dur-
ing much of the last 65 million years and
beyond, Earth’s climate system has experi-
enced continuous change, drifting from ex-
tremes of expansive warmth with ice-free
poles, to extremes of cold with massive
continental ice-sheets and polar ice caps.
Such change is not unexpected, because the
primary forces that drive long-term climate,
Earth’s orbital geometry and plate tecton-
ics, are also in perpetual motion. Much of
the higher frequency change in climate (104
to 105 years) is generated by periodic and
quasi-periodic oscillations in Earth’s orbit-
al parameters of eccentricity, obliquity, and
precession that affect the distribution and
amount of incident solar energy (Fig. 1)
(1). Whereas eccentricity affects climate by
modulating the amplitude of precession and
thus influencing the total annual/seasonal
solar energy budget, obliquity changes the
latitudinal distribution of insolation. Be-
cause the orbital parameters vary with dis-
tinct tempos that remain stable for tens of
millions of years (2), they provide a steady
and, hence, predictable pacing of climate.
The orbitally related rhythms, in turn,
oscillate about a climatic mean that is con-
stantly drifting in response to gradual
changes in Earth’s major boundary condi-
tions. These include continental geography
and topography, oceanic gateway locations
and bathymetry, and the concentrations of
atmospheric greenhouse gases (3). These
boundary conditions are controlled largely
by plate tectonics, and thus tend to change
gradually, and for the most part, unidirec-
tionally, on million-year (My) time scales.
Some of the more consequential changes in
boundary conditions over the last 65 My
include:
North
Atlantic
rift
volcanism,
opening and widening of the two Antarctic
gateways, Tasmanian and Drake Passages
(4); collision of India with Asia and sub-
sequent uplift of the Himalayas and Tibetan
Plateau (5); uplift of Panama and closure of
the Central American Seaway (6) (Figs. 1
and 2); and a sharp decline in pCO2 (7).
Each of these tectonically driven events
triggered a major shift in the dynamics of
the global climate system (8–15). More-
over, in altering the primary boundary con-
ditions and/or mean climate state, some or
all of these events have altered system sen-
sitivity to orbital forcing (16), thereby in-
creasing the potential complexity and di-
versity of the climate spectrum. This would
include the potential for unusually rapid or
extreme changes in climate (17, 18).
Although Earth’s climatic history has
been reconstructed with an array of proxies
applied to both marine and terrestrial sedi-
ment archives, much of the progress in
resolving the rates and scales of Cenozoic
climate change can be attributed to the
development of high-resolution deep-sea
oxygen (d18O) and carbon (d13C) isotope
records (19). Since the early 1970s, d18O
data have served as the principal means of
reconstructing global and regional climate
change on a variety of geologic time-scales,
from millennial to tectonic. These records
are multidimensional in that they provide
both climatic and stratigraphic information,
and can be quickly generated with automat-
ed mass spectrometers. The first marine
isotope records were relatively coarse, but
still provided valuable insight into the gen-
eral structure of the Pleistocene glacial and
interglacial cycles (20). These were fol-
lowed by records delineating the long-term
patterns of Cenozoic climate change (21–
23) and, eventually, the first global compi-
lation of records for the Cenozoic (resolu-
tion of 105 to 106 years) (24).
The last decade has witnessed a rapid
growth in the inventory of high-resolution
isotope records across the Cenozoic, aided by
the greater availability of high-quality sedi-
ment cores recovered by the Deep Sea Dril-
ling Project (DSDP) and Ocean Drilling Pro-
gram (ODP). The improved perspective pro-
vided by these records has led to some of the
most exciting scientific developments of the

last decade, including the discovery of geo-
logically abrupt shifts in climate, as well as
“transient” events, brief but extreme excur-
sions often associated with profound impacts
on global environments and the biosphere
(25–28). Moreover, these high-fidelity deep-
sea records have facilitated efforts to extend
the “astronomically calibrated” geological
time scale back into the early Cenozoic (29,
30), an achievement previously considered
difficult, if not impossible. Carbon isotope
data have proved to be equally invaluable for
stratigraphic correlation, and for providing
insight into the operation of the global carbon
cycle (31). In essence, by detailing both the
rate and magnitude of past environmental
perturbations, the latest generation of Ceno-
zoic deep-sea isotope records has opened
windows into a climatically dynamic period
in Earth history. This, in turn, has proven
invaluable for developing and testing new
theories on mechanisms of past climate
change (32–34), and for providing the frame-
work to assess the influence of climate on the
environment (35).
The Deep-Sea Stable Isotope Record
As a framework for this review, oxygen and
carbon isotope data for bottom-dwelling,
deep-sea foraminifera from over 40 DSDP
and ODP sites representing various inter-
vals of the Cenozoic were culled from the
literature and compiled into a single global
deep-sea isotope record (Fig. 2) [Web table
1 (36)]. The numerical ages are relative to
the standard geomagnetic polarity time
scale (GPTS) for the Cenozoic [Web note 1
(36)] (37). To facilitate visualization and
minimize biases related to inconsistencies
in sampling density in space and time, the
raw data were smoothed and curve-fitted
with a locally weighted mean. The smooth-
ing results in a loss of detail that is unde-
tectable in the long-time scale perspective.
The oxygen isotope data provide con-
straints on the evolution of deep-sea tem-
perature and continental ice volume [Web
note 2 (36)]. Because deep ocean waters
are derived primarily from cooling and
sinking of water in polar regions, the deep-
sea temperature data also double as a time-
averaged record of high-latitude sea-sur-
face temperatures (SST). The deep-sea car-
bon isotope data, on the other hand, provide
insight into the nature of global carbon
cycle perturbations [Web note 2 (36)] (38),
and on first-order changes in deep-sea cir-
culation patterns [Web note 3 (36)] (39)
that might trigger or arise from the climatic
changes.
Cenozoic Climate: From Greenhouse
to Icehouse
Our benthic compilation shows a total d18O
range of 5.4‰ over the course of the Ceno-
zoic (Fig. 2). Roughly ;3.1‰ of this reflects
deep-sea cooling, the remainder growth of
ice-sheets, first on Antarctica (;1.2‰), and
then in the Northern Hemisphere (;1.1‰).
We consider the climate evolution depicted
by this record under three categories: (i) long-
term (;106 to 107 years), (ii) short-term or
orbital-scale (;104 to 105 years), and (iii)
aberrations or event-scale (;103 to 104
years).
Long-term trends. The d18O record exhib-
its a number of steps and peaks that reflect on
episodes of global warming and cooling, and
ice-sheet growth and decay (Fig. 2). The most
pronounced warming trend, as expressed by a
1.5‰ decrease in d18O, occurred early in the
Cenozoic, from the mid-Paleocene (59 Ma)
to early Eocene (52 Ma), and peaked with the
early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO; 52
to 50 Ma). The EECO was followed by a
Fig. 1. Primary orbital components are displayed on the left, and Cenozoic paleogeography on the
right. The gravitational forces exerted by other celestial bodies affect Earth’s orbit. As a result, the
amount and, more importantly, the distribution of incoming solar radiation oscillate with time
(123). There are three orbital perturbations with ﬁve periods: eccentricity (at 400 and 100 ky),
obliquity (41 ky), and precession (23 and 19 ky). (A) Eccentricity refers to the shape of Earth’s orbit
around the sun, varying from near circular to elliptical. This effect on insolation is very small,
however, and by itself should not account for changes in Earth’s climate during the past. (B)
Obliquity refers to the tilt of Earth’s axis relative to the plane of the ecliptic varying between 22.1°
and 24.5°. A high angle of tilt increases the seasonal contrast, most effectively at high latitudes
(e.g., winters in both hemispheres will be colder and summers hotter as obliquity increases). (C)
Precession refers to the wobble of the axis of rotation describing a circle in space with a period of
26 ky. Modulated by orbital eccentricity, precession determines where on the orbit around the sun
(e.g., with relation to aphelion or perihelion) seasons occur, thereby increasing the seasonal
contrast in one hemisphere and decreasing it in the other. The effect is largest at the equator and
decreases with increasing latitude. The periods of the precessional signal modulated by eccentricity
are 23 and 19 ky, the periods observed in geological records. (D) Continental geography recon-
structed for ﬁve intervals of the last 70 My (designed using the commercial Paleogeographic
Information System).

17-My-long trend toward cooler conditions
as expressed by a 3.0‰ rise in d18O with
much of the change occurring over the early-
middle (50 to 48 Ma) and late Eocene (40 to
36 Ma), and the early Oligocene (35 to 34
Ma). Of this total, the entire increase in d18O
prior to the late Eocene (;1.8‰) can be
attributed to a 7.0°C decline in deep-sea tem-
perature (from ;12° to ;4.5°C). All subse-
quent d18O change reflects a combined effect
of ice-volume and temperature (40), particu-
larly for the rapid .1.0‰ step in d18O at 34
Ma. On the basis of limits imposed by bot-
tom-water and tropical temperatures, it has
been estimated that roughly half this signal
(;0.6‰) must reflect increased ice volume
(24, 41), though independent constraints on
temperature derived from benthic foraminif-
eral Mg/Ca ratios argue for a slightly greater
ice-volume component (;0.8 to 1.0‰) (42).
This long-term pattern of deep-sea warming
and cooling is consistent with reconstructions
of early Cenozoic subpolar climates based on
both marine and terrestrial geochemical and
fossil evidence (43–47).
Following the cooling and rapid expan-
sion of Antarctic continental ice-sheets in the
earliest Oligocene, deep-sea d18O values re-
mained relatively high (.2.5‰), indicating a
permanent ice sheet(s), likely temperate in
character (48), with a mass as great as 50% of
that of the present-day ice sheet and bottom
temperatures of ;4°C (18). These ice sheets
persisted until the latter part of the Oligocene
(26 to 27 Ma), when a warming trend reduced
the extent of Antarctic ice. From this point
until the middle Miocene (;15 Ma), global
ice volume remained low and bottom water
temperatures trended slightly higher (49, 50),
with the exception of several brief periods of
glaciation (e.g., Mi-events) (39). This warm
phase peaked in the late middle Miocene
climatic optimum (17 to 15 Ma), and was
followed by a gradual cooling and reestab-
lishment of a major ice-sheet on Antarctica

Fig. 2. Global deep-sea oxygen and carbon isotope records based on data
compiled from more than 40 DSDP and ODP sites (36). The sedimentary
sections from which these data were generated are classiﬁed as pelagic
(e.g., from depths .1000 m) with lithologies that are predominantly
ﬁne-grained, carbonate-rich (.50%) oozes or chalks. Most of the data
are derived from analyses of two common and long-lived benthic taxa,
Cibicidoides and Nuttallides. To correct for genus-speciﬁc isotope vital
effects, the d18O values were adjusted by 10.64 and 10.4‰ (124),
respectively. The absolute ages are relative to the standard GPTS (36,
37). The raw data were smoothed using a ﬁve-point running mean, and
curve-ﬁtted with a locally weighted mean. With the carbon isotope
record, separate curve ﬁts were derived for the Atlantic (blue) and Paciﬁc
above the middle Miocene to illustrate the increase in basin-to-basin
fractionation that exceeds ;1.0‰ in some intervals. Prior to 15 Ma,
interbasin gradients are insigniﬁcant or nonexistent (39). The d18O
temperature scale was computed for an ice-free ocean [;1.2‰ Standard
Mean Ocean Water (SMOW )], and thus only applies to the time pre-
ceding the onset of large-scale glaciation on Antarctica (;35 Ma)
(43). From the early Oligocene to present, much of the variability
(;70%) in the d18O record reﬂects changes in Antarctica and North-
ern Hemisphere ice volume (40). The vertical bars provide a rough
qualitative representation of ice volume in each hemisphere relative
to the LGM, with the dashed bar representing periods of minimal ice
coverage (&50%), and the full bar representing close to maximum ice
coverage (.50% of present). Some key tectonic and biotic events are
listed as well (4, 5, 35).

by 10 Ma (51, 52). Mean d18O values then
continued to rise gently through the late Mio-
cene until the early Pliocene (6 Ma), indicat-
ing additional cooling and small-scale ice-
sheet expansion on west-Antarctica (53) and
in the Arctic (54). The early Pliocene is
marked by a subtle warming trend (55) until
;3.2 Ma, when d18O again increased reflect-
ing the onset of Northern Hemisphere Glaci-
ation (NHG) (56, 57).
Rhythms. Given this framework for long-
term trends, how has the tempo and ampli-
tude
of
orbital
scale
climate
variability
evolved through the Cenozoic, particularly
during the transitions between different gla-
cial states (unipolar to bipolar)? To address
this, we turn to high-resolution time-series
spanning four intervals: 0.0 to 4.0, 12.5 to
16.5, 20.5 to 24.5, and 31.0 to 35.0 Ma, each
representing an interval of major continental
ice-sheet growth or decay. The time-series
are from DSDP and ODP Sites 659 [0 to 4
Ma (58)], 588 [12.5 to 16.5 Ma (59)], 929
[20.5 to 24.5 (60)], and 522 [31 to 35 Ma (61,
62)] (Fig. 3). Two of the records, Sites 659
and 929, have orbitally tuned age models.
The mean sampling density varies from
roughly 2 ky for the 0- to 4-Ma time slice to
9 ky for the 31- to 35-Ma time slice, thereby
limiting resolution of the high-frequency or-
bital-scale periodicities in the oldest inter-
vals. Nevertheless, resolution is high enough
to avoid signal aliasing of lower frequency
periods.
These and other benthic d18O time-se-
ries demonstrate that climate varies in a
quasi-periodic fashion during all intervals
characterized by glaciation, regardless of
the location and extent of ice-sheets. In
terms of frequency, much of the power in
the climate spectrum since the early Oligo-
cene appears to be concentrated in the
obliquity band (;40 ky) (Fig. 4). Addition-
al power resides in the eccentricity bands,
although the signal strength is more vari-
able. For example, d18O variance in the
100-ky frequency band is exceptionally
pronounced over the last 800 to 900 ky
following a mid-Pleistocene shift (63), but
weaker through the early Pleistocene and
Pliocene when the signal was dominated by
variance in the 41-ky band (64, 65). Similar
secular shifts in the power of the 100-ky
cycle occurred in the late Oligocene and
early Miocene. Power in the 400-ky band is
exceptionally pronounced in the early Mio-
cene, whereas it is relatively weak in the
Pleistocene (66, 67), and early Oligocene
(61, 68).

quency for (A) the Plio-Pleistocene (0 to 4 Ma)
and (B) Oligocene-Miocene (20.5 to 24.5), as
based on the benthic d18O time series of Sites
659 and 929. The analyses were performed
using the Blackman-Tuckey method (Arand
Software). Both records were detrended and
resampled at 1-ky steps. Both records have
been tuned to the orbital spectrum Atlantic

Site 929, western equatorial Atlantic (60); Site 522, south Atlantic (61); and Site 689, Southern Ocean
(68). Sampling intervals range from 3 to 10 ky. Note that the d18O axes on all plots are set to the same
scale (3.0‰), though at different ranges to accommodate the change in mean ocean temperature/ice
volume with time. The Plio-Pleistocene ages for Site 659 are constrained by oxygen isotope records
directly or indirectly calibrated to Northern Hemisphere summer insolation at 65°N, based on the
astronomical solutions of Berger and Loutre (123). The Site 929 age model is also calibrated to an orbital
curve derived from the formulations of Laskar (2) with corrections for tidal dissipation (29). The upper
curves in (A) and (C) represent Gaussian band-pass ﬁlters designed to isolate variance associated with
the 400- and 100-ky eccentricity cycles. The 400-ky ﬁlter has a central frequency 5 0.0025 and a
bandwidth 5 0.0002; the 100-ky central frequency 5 0.01 and bandwidth 5 0.002. Filters were not
constructed for the two records, at sites 588 and 522, which have not been orbitally tuned.

The variations in the amplitude of the
Cenozoic deep sea d18O signal largely reflect
on changes in continental ice-volume and
temperature. For example, the largest oscilla-
tions are recorded over the last 800 ky during
the period of maximum NHG. The most re-
cent independent constraints on the isotopic
composition of seawater during the last major
ice advance (20 ka) suggest that ,1.0‰ of
the total range of ;2.4‰ for this period may
reflect changes in ice volume, the remainder
temperature (69, 70). Conversely, the lowest
amplitude oscillations (;0.2 to 0.3‰) were
in the late Eocene prior to the appearance of
permanent
Antarctic
ice-sheets.
Slightly
higher amplitude oscillations (;0.5‰) oc-
curred in the early Oligocene, late Miocene
(71), and early Pliocene (72), when Antarcti-
ca was close to fully glaciated. Conversely,
larger amplitude (0.5 to 1.0‰) oscillations
are recorded in the latest Oligocene and early
Miocene, the period when Antarctica was
minimally or only partially glaciated.
Aberrations. Perhaps the most interesting
and unexpected discoveries of the last decade
are the aberrations. These are loosely defined
as brief (;103 to 105 y) anomalies that stand
out well above “normal” background vari-
ability in terms of rate and/or amplitude, and
are usually accompanied by a major pertur-
bation in the global carbon cycle as inferred
from carbon isotope data. The three largest
occurred at ;55, 34, and 23 Ma, all near or at
epoch boundaries. This last distinction is sig-
nificant in that it implies that each of these
climate events may have also had widespread
and long-lasting impacts on the biosphere.
The most prominent of the climatic aber-
rations is the Late Paleocene Thermal Maxi-
mum (LPTM), which occurred at 55 Ma near
the Paleocene/Eocene (P/E) boundary. This
event is characterized by a 5° to 6°C rise in
deep-sea temperature (.1.0‰ negative iso-
tope excursion) in less than 10 ky (Fig. 5)
(25, 26, 73). Sea surface temperatures as
constrained by planktonic isotope records
also increased, by as much as 8°C at high
latitudes and lesser amounts toward the equa-
tor (47, 74, 75). Recovery was gradual, taking
;200 ky from the onset of the event (30). An
associated notable change in climate was glo-
bally higher humidity and precipitation, as
evidenced by changes in the character and
patterns of continental weathering (76, 77).
The event is also characterized by a ;3.0‰
negative carbon isotope excursion of the ma-
rine, atmospheric, and terrestrial carbon res-
ervoirs (Fig. 5) (25, 78–80); widespread dis-
solution of seafloor carbonate (75, 81); mass
extinction of benthic foraminifera (82); wide-
spread proliferation of exotic planktic fora-
minifera taxa (74, 83) and the dinoflagellate
Apectodinium (84); and the dispersal and
subsequent radiation of Northern Hemisphere
land plants and mammals (78, 85–88). The
recovery interval is marked by a possible rise
in marine and terrestrial productivity and or-
ganic carbon deposition (89, 90).
In contrast, the next two climatic aberra-
tions are characterized by positive oxygen
isotope excursions that reflect brief extremes
in Antarctic ice-volume and temperature (27,
61). The first of these lies just above the
Eocene/Oligocene boundary (34.0 Ma) (Fig.
3). It is a 400-ky-long glacial that initiated
with the sudden appearance of large conti-
nental ice sheets on Antarctica. This transi-
tion, referred to as Oi-1 (50), appears to
involve reorganization of the climate/ocean
system as evidenced by global wide shifts in
the distribution of marine biogenic sediments
and an overall increase in ocean fertility (62,
91, 92), and by a major drop in the calcium
carbonate compensation depth (93, 94). The
second aberration coincided with the Oligo-
cene/Miocene boundary (;23 Ma) (95) and
consists of a brief but deep (;200 ky) glacial
maximum (Fig. 3) (60). This event, referred
to as Mi-1 (50), was followed by a series of
intermittent but smaller glaciations. Both
Oi-1 and Mi-1 were accompanied by accel-
erated rates of turnover and speciation in
certain groups of biota, although on a smaller
scale than at the LPTM (96). Of particular
significance are the rise of modern whales
(i.e., baleen) and shift in continental floral
communities at the E/O boundary (97, 98),
and the extinction of Caribbean corals at the
O/M boundary (99). Furthermore, both tran-
sients are characterized by small but sharp
positive carbon isotope excursions (;0.8‰)
suggestive of perturbations to the global car-
bon cycle (Fig. 2). Although records indicate
a number of lesser events in the Oligocene
and Miocene, none appear to approach Oi-1
and Mi-1 events in terms of magnitude.
Implications for Climate Forcing
Mechanisms
Has the greater temporal resolution of Ceno-
zoic climate afforded by the latest isotope
reconstructions altered our understanding of
the nature of long- and short-term climate
change? The answer to this is both yes and
no. Perhaps the most important developments
concern the glacial history of Antarctica, and
the scale and timing of climatic aberrations.
In the case of the former, it is evident that ice
sheets have been present on Antarctica for the
last 40 My, and over much of that time have
been extremely dynamic, implying a high
degree of instability and/or sensitivity to forc-
ing. As for the aberrations, their mere exis-
tence points toward the potential for highly
nonlinear responses in climate to forcing, or
Fig. 5. The LPTM as recorded in benthic d13C and d18O records (A and B, respectively) from Sites
527 and 690 in the south Atlantic (73), and Site 865 in the western Paciﬁc (26). The time scale is
based on the cycle stratigraphy of Site 690 (30) with the base of the excursion placed at 54.95 Ma.
The other records have been correlated to Site 690 using the carbon isotope stratigraphy. Apparent
leads and lags are artifacts of differences in sample spacing. The oxygen isotope values have been
adjusted for species-speciﬁc vital effects (118), and the temperature scale on the right is for an
ice-free ocean. The negative carbon isotope excursion is thought to represent the inﬂux of up to
2600 Gt of methane from dissociation of seaﬂoor clathrate (111).

the possibility of unexpected anomalies in
forcing.
Gateways or pCO2? With the previous
less-detailed perspective of Cenozoic cli-
mate—that is, warm and ice-free in the be-
ginning to cold and glaciated at present—
there was tendency to attribute the unidirec-
tional trend, Cenozoic cooling, to a single
factor such as the increased thermal isolation
of Antarctica due to the increased widening
of the oceanic passages. However, as the
complex nature of the long-term trend comes
into focus, it is becoming clear that more than
one factor was responsible. A case in point is
the transition into and out of the long-term
Oligocene glaciation. Thermal isolation of
Antarctica by widening oceanic passages
may explain the initial appearance of Antarc-
tic ice-sheets, but fails to explain the subse-
quent termination. New reconstructions of
Cenozoic pCO2 (Fig. 6) (7, 100) have added
another dimension to this argument, indicat-
ing that this termination occurred at a time
when greenhouse gas levels were declining or
already relatively low. This reinforces the
notion that moisture supply was the critical
element in maintaining large polar ice-sheets,
at least during the middle Cenozoic (101,
102). Although globally averaged precipita-
tion should covary with pCO2, on regional
scales other parameters such as circulation
patterns need to be considered as well. Future
efforts to model the onset of Oligocene gla-
ciation should investigate the role of the hy-
drological cycle in maintaining large ice-
sheets on an otherwise warmer than present
Antarctic
continent.
Similarly,
with
low
pCO2 over the last 25 My, tectonic events
such as mountain building or oceanic gate-
way reconfigurations, which can alter ocean/
atmosphere circulation and heat and vapor
transport, may have had a dominant role in
triggering large-scale shifts in climate (10,
11, 103). Conversely, at these low levels,
subtle changes in pCO2, at least within the
error of the proxy estimates, may be impor-
tant in triggering ice-volume changes, again
not just through influences on radiative forc-
ing, but also on atmospheric circulation pat-
terns and humidity. Clearly, in the case of
long-term trends, with so many variables,
some still not well constrained (i.e., pCO2,
approximate timing of tectonic events), the
task of relating response to forcing is still far
from complete.
Orbital pacing. Efforts to relate periodic
climate variability to forcing through the Ce-
nozoic have proven to been far more success-
ful. For example, it is now evident that the
primary beat of the glaciated Cenozoic is in
the obliquity band, regardless of the state of
other boundary conditions or the location of
ice sheets (e.g., Fig. 4). This is true for the
lower frequency 1.25-My period of obliquity
as well (104). This observation confirms the
highly sensitive nature of ice-sheets to obliq-
uity-generated changes in high-latitude inso-
lation, particularly when the polar regions
(i.e., Antarctica) are only partially ice-cov-
ered, as in the Miocene. Although the benthic
isotope records currently available for the
ice-free Cenozoic lack adequate resolution to
fully characterize obliquity variance, other
proxy records (i.e., physical properties) sug-
gest that the global climatic response was
dominated by variance in the precession-re-
lated bands (30, 105). This supports the no-
tion that the overall influence of obliquity on
global climate during ice-free periods, with-
out an ice-sheet amplifier, is weaker or less
apparent.
A more definitive finding, however, is the
verification of a strong pre-Pleistocene cli-
mate response to eccentricity oscillations, as
exemplified by the concentration of power at
the 100- and 400-ky periods (27, 67). Anal-
yses of the climate signal over those intervals
where it is pronounced (i.e., the Miocene)
reveal a high degree of coherency with ec-
centricity in terms of frequency and ampli-
tude modulation. This finding supports the
class of models that relate amplification of
power in the eccentricity bands to the filter-
ing effects of continental geography and dif-
ferences in land-sea heating on precession,
especially in the tropics (16). Here, power
(temperature) can be shifted into the primary
eccentricity bands via truncation of the cooler
portion
of
precession-related
insolation
change. What remains unclear is how these
effects are then exported to higher latitudes.
Researchers have considered a variety of
mechanisms for directly and indirectly ampli-
fying the response to precession forcing
(106–109). This includes processes such as
ocean and atmospheric circulation that direct-
ly or indirectly influence heat-transport, pre-
cipitation, and/or the global carbon cycle and
pCO2. Of these, the carbon cycle is most
appealing because of its long time constants,
but is difficult to verify because of the large
number of variables involved. Still, support
for a carbon cycle amplifier is provided by
Oligocene-Miocene carbon isotope records,
which exhibit pervasive large-amplitude 100-
and 400-ky oscillations that are highly coher-
ent with the glacial cycles (60). Furthermore,
reanalysis of ice-core data and other records
indicate that the primary response to eccen-
tricity in the late Pleistocene benthic d18O
record is in temperature, not ice volume as
originally believed, and that ice volume
lagged eccentricity forcing, CO2, and deep-
sea temperature by the appropriate phase
(70).
Thresholds, methane eruptions, and orbit-
al anomalies. Characterizing the timing and
scale of the three aberrations discussed here
in the context of longer-term background pa-
leoenvironmental variability has been critical
to the development and testing of hypotheses
on their origins. To begin with, each aberra-
tion was superimposed on a long-term grad-
ual trend in the same direction. In terms of
tempo, the step into the LPTM was much
more abrupt (;103 to 104 years) than that
into the Oi-1 and Mi-1 events (;105 years),
and the recovery more gradual. This, and the
fact that the direction of climatic change is
opposite (e.g., a warming instead of cooling),
hints at a different mechanism. For the
LPTM, the abrupt negative ;3.0‰ global
carbon isotope excursion (CIE) (Fig. 5) im-
plicates a rise in greenhouse gas concentra-
tions, most likely from the dissociation and
subsequent oxidation of 2000 to 2600 Gt of
isotopically light (;–60‰) methane from
marine clathrates as proposed by Dickens et
al. (33, 110). The carbon mass from this is
consistent with a reduction in ocean pH as
inferred from evidence for seafloor carbonate
dissolution (111, 112). Although other sourc-
es of CO2 have been considered (i.e., volca-
nic), the much greater masses required to
generate the CIE would alter ocean chemistry
to an extent unsupported by data. Why would
such a large mass of methane hydrate sud-
denly dissociate at 55 Ma? Suggested trigger-
ing mechanisms range from the gradual

ifers (7). The second
pCO2 curve spanning the Miocene is based on the d13C values of phytoplankton organic compounds
known as alkenones (100). Both approaches assume chemical equilibrium between the ocean and
atmosphere. In the intervals of overlap, both proxies provide nearly identical estimates of
paleo-pCO2.

crossing of a thermal threshold via long-term
deep-sea warming (110), to more abrupt
deep-sea warming resulting from sudden
changes in ocean circulation (113, 114), to
massive regional slope failure (115).
In contrast to the LPTM, the much smaller
magnitude and positive carbon isotope excur-
sions for the Oi-1 and Mi-1 events indicate
that greenhouse gas forcing was probably not
the primary causal mechanism, but instead
may have served as a positive or amplifying
feedback. In this scenario, tectonic forcing is
viewed at the primary triggering mechanism
that drives the climate system across a phys-
ical threshold (i.e., temperature), which then
initiates rapid growth of ice-sheets along with
reorganization of ocean/atmosphere circula-
tion (17). The physical changes, in turn, trig-
ger large-scale biogeochemical feedbacks in
the carbon cycle that initially amplify the
climatic changes (18). Such feedbacks would
be short-lived, because other coupled biogeo-
chemical processes would eventually restore
equilibrium to the system.
Orbital forcing may have had a hand in
triggering these events as well, possibly as a
means of providing the climate system with a
final and relatively rapid push across a cli-
matic threshold, or even as the principal driv-
ing force. For example, the Mi-1 event ap-
pears to be in phase with a long series of
regular
low-frequency
oscillations
(i.e.,
;400 ky cycles) (27). Comparison of the Site
929 isotope records with the orbital curve (2),
revealed that the low-frequency (400 ky) gla-
cial maxima, including Mi-1, coincided with,
and hence, were being paced by eccentricity
minima (60). A normal cycle of low eccen-
tricity, however, fails to explain the unusual
amplitude of Mi-1. What is unusual is the
congruence this low in eccentricity with a
protracted node in obliquity (34). This rare
orbital alignment involved four consecutive
cycles of low-amplitude variance in obliquity
(a node) coincident with the low eccentricity
that resulted in an extended period (;200 ky)
of cool summer orbits, and possibly, ice-sheet
expansion on Antarctica.
In sum, it now appears that extreme aber-
rations in global climate can arise through a
number of mechanisms. This would explain
both the random distribution and frequency
of such events over time. Some, such as rare
anomalies in Earth’s orbit, are predictable, at
least to the extent that the orbital computa-
tions are correct. Others, like catastrophic
methane release, are less so, although closer
scrutiny of earlier time intervals when bound-
ary conditions were similar to those preced-
ing the LPTM might reveal the existence of
similar aberrations (116). Correlation does
not necessarily prove causation, but in the
case of aberrations, the short time scales in-
volved significantly reduces the number of
potential variables, thereby rendering the task
of identifying and testing mechanisms a more
tractable proposition. Moreover, the abrupt
transitions and transients offer a unique op-
portunity to study the dynamics of a rapidly
changing climate system, as well as the re-
sponse of the biosphere and biogeochemical
cycles on global or regional scales to signif-
icant, sudden changes in greenhouse gas lev-
els. To this end, future efforts should concen-
trate on establishing, in greater temporal de-
tail, the global- and regional-scale changes
associated with these short-lived events, par-
ticularly in climatically and/or environmen-
tally sensitive regions, both marine and ter-
restrial (i.e., high latitudes, tropics, marginal
seas, and continental interiors).

oxygen (18O/16O) in the calcite (CaCO3) shells of
marine organisms such as benthic foraminifera provide
information on temperature and the isotopic compo-
sition of seawater (i.e., ice volume). In general, calcite

ice sheets prior to the earliest Oligocene, and large
ice-sheets thereafter, is supported by several lines

93. The calcite compensation depth (CCD) represents
the depth in the ocean at which dissolved carbon-
ate ion content [CO3] transitions from being sat-
urated to undersaturated. Virtually no biogenic
calcite is preserved in sediments beneath this
level, which at present is roughly 4500 m in the
Atlantic and 3500 m in the Paciﬁc. Because the
degree of [CO3] saturation is sensitive to ﬂuxes of
respired CO2 and dissolved ions to the ocean, the
CCD is constantly changing with time.
