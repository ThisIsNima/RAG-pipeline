Plastics are inexpensive, lightweight and durable materials, which can readily be moulded into a var-
iety of products that ﬁnd use in a wide range of applications. As a consequence, the production of
plastics has increased markedly over the last 60 years. However, current levels of their usage and
disposal generate several environmental problems. Around 4 per cent of world oil and gas pro-
duction, a non-renewable resource, is used as feedstock for plastics and a further 3–4% is expended
to provide energy for their manufacture. A major portion of plastic produced each year is used to
make disposable items of packaging or other short-lived products that are discarded within a year
of manufacture. These two observations alone indicate that our current use of plastics is not sustain-
able. In addition, because of the durability of the polymers involved, substantial quantities of discarded
end-of-life plastics are accumulating as debris in landﬁlls and in natural habitats worldwide.
Recycling is one of the most important actions currently available to reduce these impacts and
represents one of the most dynamic areas in the plastics industry today. Recycling provides oppor-
tunities to reduce oil usage, carbon dioxide emissions and the quantities of waste requiring disposal.
Here, we brieﬂy set recycling into context against other waste-reduction strategies, namely reduction
in material use through downgauging or product reuse, the use of alternative biodegradable
materials and energy recovery as fuel.
While plastics have been recycled since the 1970s, the quantities that are recycled vary geographi-
cally, according to plastic type and application. Recycling of packaging materials has seen rapid
expansion over the last decades in a number of countries. Advances in technologies and systems
for the collection, sorting and reprocessing of recyclable plastics are creating new opportunities
for recycling, and with the combined actions of the public, industry and governments it may be
possible to divert the majority of plastic waste from landﬁlls to recycling over the next decades.

1. INTRODUCTION
The plastics industry has developed considerably since
the invention of various routes for the production of
polymers from petrochemical sources. Plastics have
substantial beneﬁts in terms of their low weight,
durability and lower cost relative to many other
material types (Andrady & Neal 2009; Thompson et al.
2009a). Worldwide polymer production was estimated
to be 260 million metric tonnes per annum in the year
2007
for
all
polymers
including
thermoplastics,
thermoset plastics, adhesives and coatings, but not
synthetic ﬁbres (PlasticsEurope 2008b). This indicates
a historical growth rate of about 9 per cent p.a.
Thermoplastic resins constitute around two-thirds of
this production and their usage is growing at about
5 per cent p.a. globally (Andrady 2003).
Today, plastics are almost completely derived from
petrochemicals
produced
from
fossil
oil
and
gas.
Around 4 per cent of annual petroleum production is
converted directly into plastics from petrochemical
feedstock (British Plastics Federation 2008). As the man-
ufacture of plastics also requires energy, its production is
responsible for the consumption of a similar additional
quantity of fossil fuels. However, it can also be argued
that use of lightweight plastics can reduce usage of fossil
fuels, for example in transport applications when plastics
replace heavier conventional materials such as steel
(Andrady & Neal 2009; Thompson et al. 2009b).
Approximately 50 per cent of plastics are used for
single-use disposable applications, such as packaging,
agricultural ﬁlms and disposable consumer items,
between 20 and 25% for long-term infrastructure
such as pipes, cable coatings and structural materials,
and the remainder for durable consumer applications
with intermediate lifespan, such as in electronic
goods, furniture, vehicles, etc. Post-consumer plastic
waste generation across the European Union (EU)
was 24.6 million tonnes in 2007 (PlasticsEurope
2008b). Table 1 presents a breakdown of plastics
consumption in the UK during the year 2000, and con-
tributions to waste generation (Waste Watch 2003).

This conﬁrms that packaging is the main source of
waste plastics, but it is clear that other sources such
as waste electronic and electrical equipment (WEEE)
and
end-of-life
vehicles
(ELV)
are
becoming
signiﬁcant sources of waste plastics.
Because plastics have only been mass-produced for
around 60 years, their longevity in the environment is
not known with certainty. Most types of plastics are not
biodegradable (Andrady 1994), and are in fact extremely
durable, and therefore the majority of polymers manufac-
tured today will persist for at least decades, and probably
for centuries if not millennia. Even degradable plastics
may persist for a considerable time depending on local
environmental factors, as rates of degradation depend on
physical factors, such as levels of ultraviolet light exposure,
oxygen and temperature (Swift & Wiles 2004), while
biodegradable plastics require the presence of suitable
micro-organisms. Therefore, degradation rates vary
considerably between landﬁlls, terrestrial and marine
environments (Kyrikou & Briassoulis 2007). Even when
a plastic item degrades under the inﬂuence of weathering,
itﬁrstbreaksdownintosmaller piecesofplasticdebris,but
the polymer itself may not necessarily fully degrade in a
meaningful timeframe. As a consequence, substantial
quantities of end-of-life plastics are accumulating in land-
ﬁlls and as debris in the natural environment, resulting
in both waste-management issues and environmental
damage
(see
Barnes
et
al.
2009;
Gregory
2009;
Oehlmann et al. 2009; Ryan et al. 2009; Teuten et al.
2009; Thompson et al. 2009b).
Recycling is clearly a waste-management strategy,
but it can also be seen as one current example of
implementing
the
concept
of
industrial
ecology,
whereas in a natural ecosystem there are no wastes
but
only products
(Frosch
&
Gallopoulos
1989;
McDonough & Braungart 2002). Recycling of plastics
is one method for reducing environmental impact and
resource
depletion.
Fundamentally,
high
levels
of
recycling, as with reduction in use, reuse and repair or
re-manufacturing can allow for a given level of product
service with lower material inputs than would otherwise
be required. Recycling can therefore decrease energy
and material usage per unit of output and so yield
improved eco-efﬁciency (WBCSD 2000). Although,
it should be noted that the ability to maintain whatever
residual level of material input, plus the energy inputs
and the effects of external impacts on ecosystems
will decide the ultimate sustainability of the overall
system.
In this paper, we will review the current systems and
technology for plastics recycling, life-cycle evidence
for the eco-efﬁciency of plastics recycling, and brieﬂy
consider related economic and public interest issues.
We will focus on production and disposal of packaging
as this is the largest single source of waste plastics in
Europe and represents an area of considerable recent
expansion in recycling initiatives.
2. WASTE MANAGEMENT: OVERVIEW
Even within the EU there are a wide range of waste-
management prioritizations for the total municipal
solid
waste
stream
(MSW),
from
those
heavily
weighted towards landﬁll, to those weighted towards
incineration (ﬁgure 1)—recycling performance also
varies considerably. The average amount of MSW
generated in the EU is 520 kg per person per year
and projected to increase to 680 kg per person per
year by 2020 (EEA 2008). In the UK, total use of
plastics in both domestic and commercial packaging
is
about
40 kg
per
person
per
year,
hence
it
forms approximately 7–8% by weight, but a larger
proportion by volume of the MSW stream (Waste
Watch 2003).
Broadly speaking, waste plastics are recovered when
they are diverted from landﬁlls or littering. Plastic
packaging is particularly noticeable as litter because
of the lightweight nature of both ﬂexible and rigid
plastics. The amount of material going into the
waste-management system can, in the ﬁrst case, be
reduced by actions that decrease the use of materials in
products (e.g. substitution of heavy packaging formats
with lighter ones, or downgauging of packaging).
Designing products to enable reusing, repairing or
re-manufacturing will result in fewer products entering
the waste stream.
Once material enters the waste stream, recycling is
the process of using recovered material to manufacture
a new product. For organic materials like plastics, the
concept of recovery can also be expanded to include
energy recovery, where the caloriﬁc value of the
material is utilized by controlled combustion as a
fuel, although this results in a lesser overall environ-
mental performance than material recovery as it does
not reduce the demand for new (virgin) material.
This thinking is the basis of the 4Rs strategy in waste
management parlance—in the order of decreasing
environmental
desirability—reduce,
reuse,
recycle
(materials) and recover (energy), with landﬁll as the
least desirable management strategy.
It is also quite possible for the same polymer to
cascade through multiple stages—e.g. manufacture
into a re-usable container, which once entering the
waste stream is collected and recycled into a durable
application that when becoming waste in its turn, is
recovered for energy.

(a) Landﬁll
Landﬁll is the conventional approach to waste man-
agement, but space for landﬁlls is becoming scarce in
some countries. A well-managed landﬁll site results
in limited immediate environmental harm beyond the
impacts of collection and transport, although there
are long-term risks of contamination of soils and
groundwater by some additives and breakdown by-
products in plastics, which can become persistent
organic pollutants (Oehlmann et al. 2009; Teuten
et al. 2009). A major drawback to landﬁlls from a sus-
tainability aspect is that none of the material resources
used to produce the plastic is recovered—the material
ﬂow is linear rather than cyclic. In the UK, a landﬁll
tax has been applied, which is currently set to escalate
each year until 2010 in order to increase the incentive
to divert wastes from landﬁll to recovery actions such
as recycling (DEFRA 2007).
(b) Incineration and energy recovery
Incineration reduces the need for landﬁll of plastics
waste, however, there are concerns that hazardous sub-
stances may be released into the atmosphere in the
process. For example, PVC and halogenated additives
are typically present in mixed plastic waste leading to the
risk of dioxins, other polychlorinated biphenyls and
furans being released into the environment (Gilpin
et al. 2003). As a consequence primarily of this
perceived pollution risk, incineration of plastic is less
prevalent
than
landﬁll
and
mechanical
recycling
as a waste-management strategy. Japan and some
European countries such as Denmark and Sweden are
notable
exceptions,
with
extensive
incinerator
infrastructure in place for dealing with MSW, including
plastics.
Incineration can be used with recovery of some of
the energy content in the plastic. The useful energy
recovered can vary considerably depending on whether
it is used for electricity generation, combined heat and
power, or as solid refuse fuel for co-fuelling of blast
furnaces or cement kilns. Liquefaction to diesel fuel
or gasiﬁcation
through
pyrolysis
is also possible
(Arvanitoyannis & Bosnea 2001) and interest in this
approach to produce diesel fuel is increasing, presum-
ably
owing
to
rising
oil
prices.
Energy-recovery
processes may be the most suitable way for dealing
with highly mixed plastic such as some electronic
and electrical wastes and automotive shredder residue.
(c) Downgauging
Reducing the amount of packaging used per item will
reduce waste volumes. Economics dictate that most
manufacturers will already use close to the minimum
required material necessary for a given application
(but see Thompson et al. 2009b, Fig 1). This principle
is, however, offset against aesthetics, convenience and
marketing beneﬁts that can lead to over-use of packa-
ging, as well as the effect of existing investment in tool-
ing and production process, which can also result in
excessive packaging of some products.
(d) Re-use of plastic packaging
Forty years ago, re-use of post-consumer packaging in
the form of glass bottles and jars was common.
Limitations to the broader application of rigid container
re-use are at least partially logistical, where distribution

and collection points are distant from centralized
product-ﬁlling factories and would result in considerable
back-haul distances. In addition, the wide range of
containers and packs for branding and marketing pur-
poses makes direct take-back and reﬁlling less feasible.
Take-back and reﬁlling schemes do exist in several
European countries (Institute for Local Self-Reliance
2002), including PET bottles as well as glass, but they
are elsewhere generally considered a niche activity for
local businesses rather than a realistic large-scale strategy
to reduce packaging waste.
There is considerable scope for re-use of plastics used
for the transport of goods, and for potential re-use or
re-manufacture from some plastic components in high-
value consumer goods such as vehicles and electronic
equipment. This is evident in an industrial scale with
re-use
of
containers
and
pallets
in
haulage
(see
Thompson et al. 2009b). Some shift away from single-
use plastic carrier bags to reusable bags has also been
observed, both because of voluntary behaviour change
programmes,
as
in
Australia
(Department
of
Environment and Heritage (Australia) 2008) and as a
consequence of legislation, such as the plastic bag levy
in Ireland (Department of Environment Heritage and
Local Government (Ireland) 2007), or the recent
banning of lightweight carrier bags, for example in
Bangladesh and China.
(e) Plastics recycling
Terminology for plastics recycling is complex and
sometimes confusing because of the wide range of recy-
cling and recovery activities (table 2). These include
four categories: primary (mechanical reprocessing into
a
product
with
equivalent
properties),
secondary
(mechanical
reprocessing
into
products
requiring
lower
properties),
tertiary
(recovery
of
chemical
constituents) and quaternary (recovery of energy).
Primary recycling is often referred to as closed-loop
recycling, and secondary recycling as downgrading.
Tertiary recycling is either described as chemical or
feedstock recycling and applies when the polymer is
de-polymerized to its chemical constituents (Fisher
2003). Quaternary recycling is energy recovery, energy
from waste or valorization. Biodegradable plastics can
also be composted, and this is a further example of
tertiary recycling, and is also described as organic or
biological recycling (see Song et al. 2009).
It is possible in theory to closed-loop recycle most
thermoplastics, however, plastic packaging frequently
uses a wide variety of different polymers and other
materials such as metals, paper, pigments, inks and
adhesives that increases the difﬁculty. Closed-loop
recycling is most practical when the polymer constitu-
ent can be (i) effectively separated from sources of
contamination and (ii) stabilized against degradation
during reprocessing and subsequent use. Ideally, the
plastic waste stream for reprocessing would also con-
sist of a narrow range of polymer grades to reduce
the difﬁculty of replacing virgin resin directly. For
example, all PET bottles are made from similar
grades of PET suitable for both the bottle manufactur-
ing process and reprocessing to polyester ﬁbre, while
HDPE used for blow moulding bottles is less-suited
to injection moulding applications. As a result, the
only parts of the post-consumer plastic waste stream
that have routinely been recycled in a strictly closed-
loop fashion are clear PET bottles and recently in
the UK, HDPE milk bottles. Pre-consumer plastic
waste such as industrial packaging is currently recycled
to a greater extent than post-consumer packaging, as it
is relatively pure and available from a smaller number
of sources of relatively higher volume. The volumes of
post-consumer waste are, however, up to ﬁve times
larger than those generated in commerce and industry
(Patel et al. 2000) and so in order to achieve high
overall recycling rates, post-consumer as well as
post-industrial waste need to be collected and recycled.
In some instances recovered plastic that is not
suitable for recycling into the prior application is used
to make a new plastic product displacing all, or a
proportion of virgin polymer resin—this can also be
considered as primary recycling. Examples are plastic
crates and bins manufactured from HDPE recovered
from milk bottles, and PET ﬁbre from recovered
PET packaging. Downgrading is a term sometimes
used for recycling when recovered plastic is put into
an application that would not typically use virgin
polymer—e.g. ‘plastic lumber’ as an alternative to
higher cost/shorter lifetime timber, this is secondary
recycling (ASTM Standard D5033).
Chemical or feedstock recycling has the advantage
of recovering the petrochemical constituents of the poly-
mer, which can then be used to re-manufacture plastic
or
to
make
other
synthetic
chemicals.
However,
while technically feasible it has generally been found to
be uneconomic without signiﬁcant subsidies because of
the low price of petrochemical feedstock compared
with the plant and process costs incurred to produce
monomers from waste plastic (Patel et al. 2000). This
is not surprising as it is effectively reversing the energy-
intensive polymerization previously carried out during
plastic manufacture.
Feedstock recycling of polyoleﬁns through thermal-
cracking has been performed in the UK through a
facility initially built by BP and in Germany by
BASF. However, the latter plant was closed in 1999
(Aguado et al. 2007). Chemical recycling of PET has
been more successful, as de-polymerization under
milder conditions is possible. PET resin can be
broken down by glycolysis, methanolysis or hydrolysis,
for example to make unsaturated polyester resins
(Sinha et al. 2008). It can also be converted back

into PET, either after de-polymerization, or by simply
re-feeding the PET ﬂake into the polymerization reac-
tor, this can also remove volatile contaminants as the
reaction occurs under high temperature and vacuum
(Uhde Inventa-Fischer 2007).
(f) Alternative materials
Biodegradable plastics have the potential to solve a
number of waste-management issues, especially for
disposable packaging that cannot be easily separated
from organic waste in catering or from agricultural
applications. It is possible to include biodegradable
plastics in aerobic composting, or by anaerobic diges-
tion with methane capture for energy use. However,
biodegradable plastics also have the potential to com-
plicate waste management when introduced without
appropriate technical attributes, handling systems
and consumer education. In addition, it is clear that
there could be signiﬁcant issues in sourcing sufﬁcient
biomass
to
replace
a
large
proportion
of
the
current consumption of polymers, as only 5 per cent
of
current
European
chemical
production
uses
biomass as feedstock (Soetaert & Vandamme 2006).
This is a large topic that cannot be covered in this
paper, except to note that it is desirable that compo-
stable
and
degradable
plastics
are
appropriately
labelled and used in ways that complement, rather
than compromise waste-management schemes (see
Song et al. 2009).
3. SYSTEMS FOR PLASTIC RECYCLING
Plastic materials can be recycled in a variety of ways
and the ease of recycling varies among polymer type,
package design and product type. For example, rigid
containers consisting of a single polymer are simpler
and more economic to recycle than multi-layer and
multi-component packages.
Thermoplastics, including PET, PE and PP all
have high potential to be mechanically recycled.
Thermosetting polymers such as unsaturated polyester
or epoxy resin cannot be mechanically recycled, except
to be potentially re-used as ﬁller materials once they
have been size-reduced or pulverized to ﬁne particles
or powders (Rebeiz & Craft 1995). This is because
thermoset plastics are permanently cross-linked in
manufacture, and therefore cannot be re-melted and
re-formed. Recycling of cross-linked rubber from car
tyres back to rubber crumb for re-manufacture into
other products does occur and this is expected to
grow owing to the EU Directive on Landﬁll of Waste
(1999/31/EC), which bans the landﬁll of tyres and
tyre waste.
A major challenge for producing recycled resins
from plastic wastes is that most different plastic types
are not compatible with each other because of inherent
immiscibility at the molecular level, and differences
in processing requirements at a macro-scale. For
example, a small amount of PVC contaminant present
in a PET recycle stream will degrade the recycled PET
resin owing to evolution of hydrochloric acid gas from
the PVC at a higher temperature required to melt and
reprocess PET. Conversely, PET in a PVC recycle
stream will form solid lumps of undispersed crystalline
PET, which signiﬁcantly reduces the value of the
recycled material.
Hence, it is often not technically feasible to add
recovered plastic to virgin polymer without decreasing
at least some quality attributes of the virgin plastic
such as colour, clarity or mechanical properties such
as impact strength. Most uses of recycled resin either
blend the recycled resin with virgin resin—often
done with polyoleﬁn ﬁlms for non-critical applications
such as refuse bags, and non-pressure-rated irrigation
or drainage pipes, or for use in multi-layer appli-
cations,
where
the
recycled
resin
is
sandwiched
between surface layers of virgin resin.
The ability to substitute recycled plastic for virgin
polymer generally depends on the purity of the re-
covered plastic feed and the property requirements of
the plastic product to be made. This has led to current
recycling schemes for post-consumer waste that con-
centrate on the most easily separated packages, such
as PET soft-drink and water bottles and HDPE milk
bottles, which can be positively identiﬁed and sorted
out of a co-mingled waste stream. Conversely, there
is limited recycling of multi-layer/multi-component
articles because these result in contamination between
polymer
types.
Post-consumer
recycling
therefore
comprises of several key steps: collection, sorting,
cleaning,
size
reduction
and
separation,
and/or
compatibilization
to
reduce
contamination
by
incompatible polymers.
(a) Collection
Collection of plastic wastes can be done by ‘bring-
schemes’ or through kerbside collection. Bring-schemes
tend to result in low collection rates in the absence of
either highly committed public behaviour or deposit-
refund
schemes
that
impose
a
direct
economic
incentive to participate. Hence, the general trend is
for collection of recyclable materials through kerbside
collection alongside MSW. To maximize the cost efﬁ-
ciency of these programmes, most kerbside collections
are of co-mingled recyclables (paper/board, glass,
aluminium, steel and plastic containers). While kerbside
collection schemes have been very successful at recover-
ing plastic bottle packaging from homes, in terms of the
overall consumption typically only 30–40% of post-
consumer plastic bottles are recovered, as a lot of this
sort of packaging comes from food and beverage con-
sumed away from home. For this reason, it is important
to develop effective ‘on-the-go’ and ‘ofﬁce recycling’
collection schemes if overall collection rates for plastic
packaging are to increase.
(b) Sorting
Sorting of co-mingled rigid recyclables occurs by both
automatic and manual methods. Automated pre-
sorting is usually sufﬁcient to result in a plastics
stream separate from glass, metals and paper (other
than when attached, e.g. as labels and closures).
Generally, clear PET and unpigmented HDPE milk
bottles are positively identiﬁed and separated out of
the stream. Automatic sorting of containers is now
widely used by material recovery facility operators
and also by many plastic recycling facilities. These
Review. Plastics recycling

systems generally use Fourier-transform near-infrared
(FT-NIR) spectroscopy for polymer type analysis and
also use optical colour recognition camera systems to
sort the streams into clear and coloured fractions.
Optical sorters can be used to differentiate between
clear, light blue, dark blue, green and other coloured
PET containers. Sorting performance can be maxi-
mized using multiple detectors, and sorting in series.
Other sorting technologies include X-ray detection,
which is used for separation of PVC containers, which
are 59 per cent chlorine by weight and so can be
easily distinguished (Arvanitoyannis & Bosnea 2001;
Fisher 2003).
Most local authorities or material recovery facilities
do not actively collect post-consumer ﬂexible packaging
as there are current deﬁciencies in the equipment
that
can
easily
separate
ﬂexibles.
Many
plastic
recycling facilities use trommels and density-based air-
classiﬁcation systems to remove small amounts of
ﬂexibles such as some ﬁlms and labels. There are, how-
ever, developments in this area and new technologies
such as ballistic separators, sophisticated hydrocyclones
and air-classiﬁers that will increase the ability to recover
post-consumer ﬂexible packaging (Fisher 2003).
(c) Size reduction and cleaning
Rigid plastics are typically ground into ﬂakes and
cleaned to remove food residues, pulp ﬁbres and
adhesives. The latest generation of wash plants use
only 2–3 m3 of water per tonne of material, about
one-half of that of previous equipment. Innovative
technologies for the removal of organics and surface
contaminants
from
ﬂakes
include
‘dry-cleaning’,
which cleans surfaces through friction without using
water.
(d) Further separation
After size reduction, a range of separation techniques can
be applied. Sink/ﬂoat separation in water can effectively
separate polyoleﬁns (PP, HDPE, L/LLDPE) from
PVC, PETand PS. Use of different media can allow sep-
aration of PS from PET, but PVC cannot be removed
from PET in this manner as their density ranges overlap.
Other separation techniques such as air elutriation can
also be used for removing low-density ﬁlms from
denser ground plastics (Chandra & Roy 2007), e.g. in
removing labels from PET ﬂakes.
Technologies for reducing PVC contaminants in
PET ﬂake include froth ﬂotation (Drelich et al.
1998; Marques & Tenorio 2000)[JH1], FT-NIR or
Raman emission spectroscopic detectors to enable
ﬂake ejection and using differing electrostatic proper-
ties (Park et al. 2007). For PET ﬂake, thermal kilns
can be used to selectively degrade minor amounts of
PVC impurities, as PVC turns black on heating,
enabling colour-sorting.
Various methods exist for ﬂake-sorting, but tra-
ditional
PET-sorting
systems
are
predominantly
restricted to separating; (i) coloured ﬂakes from clear
PET ﬂakes and (ii) materials with different physical
properties such as density from PET. New approaches
such as laser-sorting systems can be used to remove
other impurities such as silicones and nylon.
‘Laser-sorting’ uses emission spectroscopy to dif-
ferentiate polymer types. These systems are likely
to
signiﬁcantly
improve
the
ability
to
separate
complex
mixtures
as
they
can
perform
up
to
860 000 spectra s21 and can scan each individual
ﬂake. They have the advantage that they can be used
to sort different plastics that are black—a problem
with traditional automatic systems. The application
of laser-sorting systems is likely to increase separation
of WEEE and automotive plastics. These systems also
have the capability to separate polymer by type or
grade and can also separate polyoleﬁnic materials
such as PP from HDPE. However, this is still a very
novel approach and currently is only used in a small
number of European recycling facilities.
(e) Current advances in plastic recycling
Innovations in recycling technologies over the last
decade include increasingly reliable detectors and
sophisticated decision and recognition software that
collectively increase the accuracy and productivity of
automatic
sorting—for
example
current
FT-NIR
detectors can operate for up to 8000 h between
faults in the detectors.
Another area of innovation has been in ﬁnding
higher value applications for recycled polymers in
closed-loop processes, which can directly replace
virgin polymer (see table 3). As an example, in the
UK, since 2005 most PET sheet for thermoforming
contains 50–70% recycled PET (rPET) through use
of A/B/A layer sheet where the outer layers (A) are
food-contact-approved virgin resin, and the inner
layer (B) is rPET. Food-grade rPET is also now
widely available in the market for direct food contact
because of the development of ‘super-clean’ grades.
These only have slight deterioration in clarity from
virgin PET, and are being used at 30–50% replace-
ment of virgin PET in many applications and at 100
per cent of the material in some bottles.
A
number
of
European
countries
including
Germany, Austria, Norway, Italy and Spain are already
collecting, in addition to their bottle streams, rigid
packaging such as trays, tubs and pots as well as limited
amounts of post-consumer ﬂexible packaging such as
ﬁlms and wrappers. Recycling of this non-bottle pack-
aging has become possible because of improvements
in sorting and washing technologies and emerging mar-
kets for the recyclates. In the UK, the Waste Resource
Action Programme (WRAP) has run an initial study
of mixed plastics recycling and is now taking this to
full-scale validation (WRAP 2008b). The potential
beneﬁts of mixed plastics recycling in terms of resource
efﬁciency, diversion from landﬁll and emission savings,
are very high when one considers the fact that in the
UK it is estimated that there is over one million tonne
per annum of non-bottle plastic packaging (WRAP
2008a) in comparison with 525 000 tonnes of plastic
bottle waste (WRAP 2007).

otherwise have been made from new (virgin) polymer,
this will directly reduce oil usage and emissions of
greenhouse gases associated with the production of
the virgin polymer (less the emissions owing to the
recycling activities themselves). However, if plastics
are recycled into products that were previously made
from other materials such as wood or concrete, then
savings in requirements for polymer production will
not be realized (Fletcher & Mackay 1996). There
may be other environmental costs or beneﬁts of any
such alternative material usage, but these are a distrac-
tion to our discussion of the beneﬁts of recycling and
would need to be considered on a case-by-case basis.
Here, we will primarily consider recycling of plastics
into
products
that
would
otherwise
have
been
produced from virgin polymer.
Feedstock (chemical) recycling technologies satisfy
the general principle of material recovery, but are
more costly than mechanical recycling, and less
energetically favourable as the polymer has to be depo-
lymerized and then re-polymerized. Historically, this
has required very signiﬁcant subsidies because of the
low price of petrochemicals in contrast to the high
process and plant costs to chemically recycle polymers.
Energy recovery from waste plastics (by transform-
ation to fuel or by direct combustion for electricity
generation, use in cement kilns and blast furnaces,
etc.) can be used to reduce landﬁll volumes, but
does not reduce the demand for fossil fuels (as the
waste
plastic
was
made
from
petrochemicals;
Garforth et al. 2004). There are also environmental
and health concerns associated with their emissions.
One of the key beneﬁts of recycling plastics is to
reduce
the
requirement
for
plastics
production.

the ‘factory gate’), and summarizes the ability of these
resins to be recycled from post-consumer waste. In
terms of energy use, recycling has been shown to
save more energy than that produced by energy recov-
ery even when including the energy used to collect,
transport and re-process the plastic (Morris 1996).
Life-cycle analyses has also been used for plastic-
recycling systems to evaluate the net environmental
impacts (Arena et al. 2003; Perugini et al. 2005) and
these ﬁnd greater positive environmental beneﬁts for
mechanical recycling over landﬁll and incineration
with energy recovery.
It has been estimated that PET bottle recycling gives
a net beneﬁt in greenhouse gas emissions of 1.5 tonnes
of CO2-e per tonne of recycled PET (Department of
Environment and Conservation (NSW) 2005) as well
as reduction in landﬁll and net energy consumption.
An average net reduction of 1.45 tonnes of CO2-e per
tonne of recycled plastic has been estimated as a
useful guideline to policy (ACRR 2004), one basis for
this value appears to have been a German life-cycle
analysis (LCA) study (Patel et al. 2000), which also
found that most of the net energy and emission beneﬁts
arise from the substitution of virgin polymer pro-
duction. A recent LCA speciﬁcally for PET bottle
manufacture calculated that use of 100 per cent
recycled PET instead of 100 per cent virgin PET
would reduce the full life-cycle emissions from 446 to
327 g CO2 per bottle, resulting in a 27 per cent relative
reduction in emissions (WRAP 2008e).
Mixed plastics, the least favourable source of recycled
polymer could still provide a net beneﬁt of the vicinity of
0.5 tonnes of CO2-e per tonne of recycled product
(WRAP 2008c). The higher eco-efﬁciency for bottle
recycling is because of both the more efﬁcient process
for recycling bottles as opposed to mixed plastics and
the particularly high emissions proﬁle of virgin PET pro-
duction. However, the mixed plastics recycling scenario
still has a positive net beneﬁt, which was considered
superior to the other options studied, of both landﬁlls
and energy recovery as solid refuse fuel, so long as
there is substitution of virgin polymer.
5. PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR RECYCLING
There is increasing public awareness on the need for
sustainable production and consumption. This has
encouraged local authorities to organize collection of
recyclables,
encouraged
some
manufacturers
to
develop products with recycled content, and other
businesses to supply this public demand. Marketing
studies of consumer preferences indicate that there is
a signiﬁcant, but not overwhelming proportion of
people who value environmental values in their pur-
chasing patterns. For such customers, conﬁrmation
of recycled content and suitability for recycling of
the packaging can be a positive attribute, while exag-
gerated claims for recyclability (where the recyclability
is potential, rather than actual) can reduce consumer
conﬁdence. It has been noted that participating in
recycling schemes is an environmental behaviour that
has wide participation among the general population
and was 57 per cent in the UK in a 2006 survey
(WRAP 2008d ), and 80 per cent in an Australian
survey where kerbside collection had been in place
for longer (NEPC 2001).
Some governments use policy to encourage post-
consumer recycling, such as the EU Directive on
packaging and packaging waste (94/62/EC). This
subsequently led Germany to set-up legislation for
extended producer responsibility that resulted in the
die Gru¨ne Punkt (Green Dot) scheme to implement
recovery and recycling of packaging. In the UK,
producer responsibility was enacted through a scheme
for generating and trading packaging recovery notes,
plus more recently a landﬁll levy to fund a range of
waste reduction activities. As a consequence of all the
above trends, the market value of recycled polymer
and hence the viability of recycling have increased
markedly over the last few years.
Extended
producer
responsibility
can
also
be
enacted through deposit-refund schemes, covering
for example, beverage containers, batteries and vehicle
tyres. These schemes can be effective in boosting
collection rates, for example one state of Australia
has a container deposit scheme (that includes PET
soft-drink bottles), as well as kerbside collection
schemes. Here the collection rate of PET bottles was
74 per cent of sales, compared with 36 per cent of
sales in other states with kerbside collection only.
The proportion of bottles in litter was reduced as
well compared to other states (West 2007).
6. ECONOMIC ISSUES RELATING
TO RECYCLING
Two key economic drivers inﬂuence the viability of
thermoplastics recycling. These are the price of the
recycled polymer compared with virgin polymer and
the cost of recycling compared with alternative forms
of acceptable disposal. There are additional issues
associated with variations in the quantity and quality
of supply compared with virgin plastics. Lack of infor-
mation about the availability of recycled plastics, its
quality and suitability for speciﬁc applications, can
also act as a disincentive to use recycled material.
Historically, the primary methods of waste disposal
have been by landﬁll or incineration. Costs of landﬁll
vary considerably among regions according to the
underlying geology and land-use patterns and can inﬂu-
ence the viability of recycling as an alternative disposal
route. In Japan, for example, the excavation that is
necessary for landﬁll is expensive because of the hard
nature of the underlying volcanic bedrock; while in
the Netherlands it is costly because of permeability
from the sea. High disposal costs are an economic
incentive towards either recycling or energy recovery.
Collection of used plastics from households is more
economical in suburbs where the population density is
sufﬁciently high to achieve economies of scale. The
most efﬁcient collection scheme can vary with locality,
type of dwellings (houses or large multi-apartment
buildings) and the type of sorting facilities available.
In rural areas ‘bring schemes’ where the public deliver
their own waste for recycling, for example when they
visit a nearby town, are considered more cost-effective
than kerbside collection. Many local authorities and
some supermarkets in the UK operate ‘bring banks’,

or
even
reverse-vending
machines.
These
latter
methods can be a good source of relatively pure recycl-
ables, but are ineffective in providing high collection
rates of post-consumer waste. In the UK, dramatic
increases in collection of the plastic bottle waste
stream was only apparent after the relatively recent
implementation of kerbside recycling (ﬁgure 2).
The price of virgin plastic is inﬂuenced by the price
of oil, which is the principle feedstock for plastic pro-
duction. As the quality of recovered plastic is typically
lower than that of virgin plastics, the price of virgin
plastic sets the ceiling for prices of recovered plastic.
The price of oil has increased signiﬁcantly in the last
few years, from a range of around USD 25 per barrel
to a price band between USD 50–150 since 2005.
Hence, although higher oil prices also increase the
cost of collection and reprocessing to some extent,
recycling has become relatively more ﬁnancially attractive.
Technological advances in recycling can improve
the economics in two main ways—by decreasing the
cost
of
recycling
(productivity/efﬁciency improve-
ments) and by closing the gap between the value of
recycled resin and virgin resin. The latter point is
particularly enhanced by technologies for turning
recovered plastic into food grade polymer by removing
contamination—supporting
closed-loop
recycling.
This technology has been proven for rPET from
clear bottles (WRAP 2008b), and more recently
rHDPE from milk bottles (WRAP 2006).
So, while over a decade ago recycling of plastics
without subsidies was mostly only viable from post-
industrial waste, or in locations where the cost of
alternative forms of disposal were high, it is increas-
ingly now viable on a much broader geographic
scale, and for post-consumer waste.
7. CURRENT TRENDS IN PLASTIC RECYCLING
In western Europe, plastic waste generation is growing
at approximately 3 per cent per annum, roughly in
line with long-term economic growth, whereas the
amount of mechanical recycling increased strongly at
a rate of approximately 7 per cent per annum. In
2003, however, this still amounted to only 14.8 per
cent of the waste plastic generated (from all sources).
Together with feedstock recycling (1.7 per cent) and
energy recovery (22.5 per cent), this amounted to a
total recovery rate of approximately 39 per cent from
the 21.1 million tonnes of plastic waste generated in
2003 (ﬁgure 3). This trend for both rates of mechanical
recycling and energy recovery to increase is continuing,
although so is the trend for increasing waste generation.
8. CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR
IMPROVING PLASTIC RECYCLING
Effective recycling of mixed plastics waste is the next
major challenge for the plastics recycling sector. The
advantage is the ability to recycle a larger proportion
of
the
plastic
waste
stream
by
expanding
post-
consumer collection of plastic packaging to cover a
wider variety of materials and pack types. Product
design for recycling has strong potential to assist in
such recycling efforts. A study carried out in the UK
found that the amount of packaging in a regular shop-
ping basket that, even if collected, cannot be effectively
recycled, ranged from 21 to 40% (Local Government
Association (UK) 2007). Hence, wider implementation
of policies to promote the use of environmental design
principles by industry could have a large impact on
recycling performance, increasing the proportion of
packaging that can economically be collected and
diverted from landﬁll (see Shaxson et al. 2009). The
same logic applies to durable consumer goods designing
for disassembly, recycling and speciﬁcations for use of
recycled resins are key actions to increase recycling.
Most post-consumer collection schemes are for rigid
packaging as ﬂexible packaging tends to be problematic
during the collection and sorting stages. Most current

material recovery facilities have difﬁculty handling ﬂex-
ible plastic packaging because of the different handling
characteristics of rigid packaging. The low weight-to-
volume ratio of ﬁlms and plastic bags also makes it
less economically viable to invest in the necessary col-
lection and sorting facilities. However, plastic ﬁlms are
currently recycled from sources including secondary
packaging such as shrink-wrap of pallets and boxes
and some agricultural ﬁlms, so this is feasible under
the right conditions. Approaches to increasing the re-
cycling of ﬁlms and ﬂexible packaging could include
separate collection, or investment in extra sorting and
processing facilities at recovery facilities for handling
mixed plastic wastes. In order to have successful recy-
cling of mixed plastics, high-performance sorting of
the input materials needs to be performed to ensure
that plastic types are separated to high levels of purity;
there is, however, a need for the further development
of endmarkets for each polymer recyclate stream.
The effectiveness of post-consumer packaging recy-
cling could be dramatically increased if the diversity of
materials were to be rationalized to a subset of current
usage. For example, if rigid plastic containers ranging
from bottles, jars to trays were all PET, HDPE and PP,
without clear PVC or PS, which are problematic to
sort from co-mingled recyclables, then all rigid plastic
packaging could be collected and sorted to make
recycled resins with minimal cross-contamination. The
losses of rejected material and the value of the recycled
resins would be enhanced. In addition, labels and
adhesive materials should be selected to maximize recy-
cling performance. Improvements in sorting/separation
within recycling plants give further potential for both
higher recycling volumes, and better eco-efﬁciency by
decreasing waste fractions, energy and water use (see
§3). The goals should be to maximize both the
volume and quality of recycled resins.
9. CONCLUSIONS
In summary, recycling is one strategy for end-of-life
waste management of plastic products. It makes
increasing sense economically as well as environmen-
tally and recent trends demonstrate a substantial
increase in the rate of recovery and recycling of plastic
wastes. These trends are likely to continue, but some
signiﬁcant challenges still exist from both technologi-
cal factors and from economic or social behaviour
issues relating to the collection of recyclable wastes,
and substitution for virgin material.
Recycling of a wider range of post-consumer plastic
packaging, together with waste plastics from consumer
goods and ELVs will further enable improvement in
recovery rates of plastic waste and diversion from
landﬁlls. Coupled with efforts to increase the use and
speciﬁcation of recycled grades as replacement of
virgin plastic, recycling of waste plastics is an effective
way to improve the environmental performance of the
polymer industry.
