Abstract
This paper provides a summary of the current equations and rescaling factors for converting
calibrated Digital Numbers (DNs) to absolute units of at-sensor spectral radiance, Top-Of-
Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, and at-sensor brightness temperature. It tabulates the necessary
constants for the Multispectral Scanner (MSS), Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic
Mapper Plus (ETM+), and Advanced Land Imager (ALI) sensors. These conversions provide a
basis for standardized comparison of data in a single scene or between images acquired on
different dates or by different sensors. This paper forms a needed guide for Landsat data users
who now have access to the entire Landsat archive at no cost.

1. Introduction
The Landsat series of satellites provides the longest continuous record of satellite-based
observations. As such, Landsat is an invaluable resource for monitoring global change and is a
primary source of medium spatial resolution Earth observations used in decision-making (Fuller et
al., 1994; Townshend et al., 1995; Goward et al., 1997; Vogelmann et al., 2001; Woodcock et al.,
2001; Cohen et al., 2004; Goward et al., 2006; Masek et al., 2008; Wulder et al., 2008). To meet
observation requirements at a scale revealing both natural and human-induced landscape
changes, Landsat provides the only inventory of the global land surface over time on a seasonal
basis (Special issues on Landsat, 1984; 1985; 1997; 2001; 2003; 2004; 2006). The Landsat
Program began in early 1972 with the launch of the first satellite in the series. As technological
capabilities increased, so did the amount and quality of image data captured by the various
sensors onboard the satellites. Table 1 presents general information about each Landsat satellite.
Landsat satellites can be classified into three groups, based on sensor and platform
characteristics. The first group consists of Landsat 1 (1-1), Landsat 2 (1-2), and Landsat 3 (1-3),
with the Multispectral Scanner (MSS) sensor and the Return Beam Vidicon (RBV) camera as
payloads on a "NIMBUS-like" platform. The spatial resolution of the MSS sensor was

approximately 79 m (but often processed to pixel size of 60 m), with four bands ranging from the
visible blue to the Near-Infrared (NIR) wavelengths. The MSS sensor on L3 included a fifth band
in the thermal infrared wavelength, with a spectral range from 10.4 to 12.6 lam. The L1—L3 MSS
sensors used a band-naming convention of MSS-4, MSS-5, MSS-6, and MSS-7 for the blue,
green, red, and NIR bands, respectively (Markham & Barker, 1983). This designation is obsolete,
and to be consistent with the TM and ETM+ sensors, the MSS bands are referred to here as
Bands 1-4, respectively.
The second group includes Landsat 4 (1-4) and Landsat 5 (1-5), which carry the Thematic
Mapper (TM) sensor, as well as the MSS, on the Multimission Modular Spacecraft. This second
generation of Landsat satellites marked a significant advance in remote sensing through the
addition of a more sophisticated sensor, improved acquisition and transmission of data, and more
rapid data processing at a highly automated processing facility. The MSS sensor was included to
provide continuity with the earlier Landsat missions, but TM data quickly became the primary
source of information used from these satellites because the data offered enhanced spatial,
spectral, radiometric, and geometric performance over data from the MSS sensor. The TM sensor
has a spatial resolution of 30 m for the six reflective bands and 120 m for the thermal band.
Because there are no onboard recorders on these sensors, acquisitions are limited to real-time
downlink only.
The third group consists of Landsat 6 (1-6) and Landsat 7 (1-7), which include the
Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) and the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensors,
respectively. No MSS sensors were included on either satellite. Landsat 6 failed on launch. The
L7 ETM+ sensor has a spatial resolution of 30 m for the six reflective bands, 60 m for the thermal
band, and includes a panchromatic (pan) band with a 15 m resolution. L7 has a 378 gigabit (Gb)
Solid State Recorder (SSR) that can hold 42 minutes (approximately 100 scenes) of sensor data
and 29 hours of housekeeping telemetry concurrently (L7 Science Data User's Handbook').
The Advanced Land Imager (ALI) onboard the Earth Observer-1 (EO-1) satellite is a
technology demonstration that serves as a prototype for the Landsat Data Continuity Mission
(LDCM). The ALI observes the Earth in 10 spectral bands; nine spectral bands have a spatial
resolution of 30 m, and a pan band has a spatial resolution of 10 m.

access and search the Landsat data archive via the Earth Explorer (EE)2 or Global Visualization
Viewer (GloVis)3 web sites. Note that the Landsat scenes collected by locations within the
International Ground Station (IGS) network may be available only from the particular station that
collected the scene.

Purpose
Equations and parameters to convert calibrated Digital Numbers (DNs) to physical units,
such as at-sensor radiance or Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, have been presented in a
"sensor-specific" manner elsewhere, e.g., MSS (Markham & Barker, 1986, 1987; Helder, 1993),
TM (Chander & Markham, 2003; Chander et al., 2007), ETM+ (Handbook'), and ALI (Markham et
al., 2004a). This paper, however, tabulates the necessary constants for all of the Landsat sensors
in one place defined in a consistent manner and provides a brief overview of the radiometric
calibration procedure summarizing the current accuracy of the at-sensor spectral radiances
obtained after performing these radiometric conversions on standard data products generated by
U.S. ground processing systems.
3.
Radiometric calibration procedure
The ability to detect and quantify changes in the Earth's environment depends on
sensors that can provide calibrated (known accuracy and precision) and consistent
measurements of the Earth's surface features through time. The correct interpretation of scientific
information from a global, long-term series of remote-sensing products requires the ability to
discriminate between product artifacts and changes in the Earth processes being monitored (Roy
et al., 2002). Radiometric characterization and calibration is a prerequisite for creating high-
quality science data, and consequently, higher-level downstream products.
3.1. 
MSS sensors
Each MSS sensor incorporates an Internal Calibrator (IC) system, consisting of a pair of
lamp assemblies (for redundancy) and a rotating shutter wheel. The shutter wheel includes a
mirror and a neutral density filter that varies in transmittance with rotation angle. The calibration
system output appears as a light pulse at the focal plane that rises rapidly and then decays
slowly. This pulse is referred to as the calibration wedge (Markham & Barker, 1987). The
radiometric calibration of the MSS sensors is performed in two stages. First, raw data from Bands
1-3 are "decompressed" or linearized and resealed to 7 bits using fixed look-up tables. The look-

Landsat MSS, TM, ETM+, and EO -1 ALI Sensors. (In Press, Remote Sensing of Environment. Manuscript Number: RSE-D-08-00684)
up tables are derived from prelaunch measurements of the compression amplifiers. Second, the
postlaunch gain and offset for each detector of all four bands are individually calculated by a
linear regression of the detector responses to the samples of the in-orbit calibration wedge with
the prelaunch radiances for these samples. A reasonable estimate of the overall calibration
uncertainty of each MSS sensor at-sensor spectral radiances is ±10%, which was the specified
accuracy for the sensor (Markham & Barker, 1987). In most cases, the ground processing system
must apply an additional step to uncalibrate the MSS data because a number of MSS scenes
were archived as radiometrically corrected products. The previously calibrated archived MSS
data must be transformed back into raw DNs using the coefficients stored in the data before
applying the radiometric calibration procedure. Studies are underway to evaluate the MSS
calibration consistency and provide post-calibration adjustments of the MSS sensors so they are
consistent over time and consistent between sensors (Helder, 2008a).
3.2. 
TM sensors
The TM sensor includes an onboard calibration system called the IC. The IC consists of a
black shutter flag, three lamps, a cavity blackbody, and the optical components necessary to get
the lamp and blackbody radiance to the focal plane. The lamps are used to calibrate the reflective
bands, and the blackbody is used to calibrate the thermal band. Historically, the TM radiometric
calibration procedure used the detector's response to the IC to determine radiometric gains and
offsets on a scene-by-scene basis. Before launch, the effective radiance of each lamp state for
each reflective band's detector was determined such that each detector's response to the internal
lamp was compared to its response to an external calibrated source. The reflective band
calibration algorithm for in-flight data used a regression of the detector responses against the
prelaunch radiances of the eight lamp states. The slope of the regression represented the gain,
while the intercept represented the bias. This algorithm assumed that irradiance of the calibration
lamps remained constant over time since launch. Any change in response was treated as a
change in sensor response, and thus was compensated for during processing. On-orbit data from
individual lamps indicated that the lamps were not particularly stable. Because there was no way
to validate the lamp radiances once in orbit, the prelaunch measured radiances were the only
metrics available for the regression procedure. Recent studies 4 (Thorne et al., 1997a, 1997b;
Helder et al., 1998; Markham et al., 1998; Teillet et al., 2001, 2004; Chander et al., 2004) indicate
that the regression calibration did not actually represent detector gains for most of the mission.
However, the regression procedure was used until 2003 to generate L5 TM data products and is
still used to generate L4 TM products. The calibration uncertainties of the L4 TM at-sensor
4 Radiometric performance studies of the TM sensors have also led to a detailed understanding of several image artifacts
due to particular sensor characteristics (Helder & Ruggles, 2004a). These artifact corrections (such as Scan-Correlated
Shift [SCS], Memory Effect [ME], and Coherent Noise [CN]), along with detector-to-detector normalization (Helder et. al.,
2004b), are necessary to maintain the internal consistency of the calibration within a scene.

spectral radiances are ±10%, which was the specified accuracy for the sensor (GSFC
specification, 1981).
The L5 TM reflective band calibration procedure was updated in 2003 (Chander &
Markham, 2003) to remove the dependence on the changing IC lamps. The new calibration gains
implemented on May 5, 2003, for the reflective bands (1-5, 7) were based on lifetime radiometric
calibration curves derived from the detectors' responses to the IC, cross-calibration with ETM+,
and vicarious measurements (Chander et al., 2004a). The gains were further revised on April 2,
2007, based on the detectors' responses to pseudo-invariant desert sites and cross-calibration
with ETM+ (Chander et al., 2007). Although this calibration update applies to all archived and
future L5 TM data, the principal improvements in the calibration are for data acquired during the
first eight years of the mission (1984-1991), where changes in the sensor gain values are as
much as 15%. The radiometric scaling coefficients for Bands 1 and 2 for approximately the first
eight years of the mission have also been changed. Along with the revised reflective band
radiometric calibration on April 2, 2007, an sensor offset correction of 0.092 W/(m 2 sr pm), or
about 0.68 K (at 300 K), was added to all L5 TM thermal band (Band 6) data acquired since April
1999 (Barsi et al., 2007). The L5 TM radiometric calibration uncertainty of the at-sensor spectral
radiances is around 5% and is somewhat worse for early years, when the sensor was changing
more rapidly, and better for later years (Helder et al., 2008b). The L4 TM reflective bands and the
thermal band on both the TM sensors continue to be calibrated using the IC. Further updates to
improve the thermal band calibration are being investigated, as is the calibration of the L4 TM.
3.3. ETM+ sensor
The ETM+ sensor has three onboard calibration devices for the reflective bands: a Full
Aperture Solar Calibrator (FASC), which is a white painted diffuser panel; a Partial Aperture Solar
Calibrator (PASO), which is a set of optics that allows the ETM+ to image the Sun through small
holes; and an IC, which consists of two lamps, a blackbody, a shutter, and optics to transfer the
energy from the calibration sources to the focal plane. The ETM+ sensor has also been calibrated
vicariously using Earth targets such as Railroad Valley (Thorne, 2001; Thome et al., 2004) and
cross-calibrated with multiple sensors (Teillet et al., 2001, 2006, 2007; Thorne et al., 2003;
Chander et al., 2004b, 2007b, 2008). The gain trends from the ETM+ sensor are regularly
monitored on-orbit using the onboard calibrators and vicarious calibration. The calibration
uncertainties of ETM+ at-sensor spectral radiances are t5%. ETM+ is the most stable of the
Landsat sensors, changing by no more than 0.5% per year in its radiometric calibration (Markham
et al., 2004b). The ETM+ radiometric calibration procedure uses prelaunch gain coefficients
populated in the Calibration Parameter File (CPF). These CPFs, issued quarterly, have both an
"effective" and "version" date. The effective date of the CPF must match the acquisition date of
5

Chander, G., Markham, B.L., Heider, D.L. (2009). Summary of Current Radiometric Calibration Coefficients for
Landsat MSS, TM, ETM+, and EO-1 ALI Sensors. (In Press, Remote Sensing of Environment, Manuscript Number: RSE-D-08-00684)
the scene. A CPF version is active until a new CPF for that date period supersedes it. Data can
be processed with any version of a CPF; the later versions have more refined parameters, as
they reflect more data-rich post-acquisition analysis.
The ETM+ images are acquired in either a low- or high-gain state. The goal of using two
gain settings is to maximize the sensors' 8-bit radiometric resolution without saturating the
detectors. For all bands, the low-gain dynamic range is approximately 1.5 times the high-gain
dynamic range. Therefore, low-gain mode is used to image surfaces with high brightness (higher
dynamic range but low sensitivity), and high-gain mode is used to image surfaces with low
brightness (lower dynamic range but high sensitivity).
All of the ETM+ acquisitions after May 31, 2003, have an anomaly caused by the failure
of the Scan Line Corrector (SLC), which compensated for the forward motion of the spacecraft so
that all the scans were aligned parallel with each other. The images with data loss are referred to
as SLC-off images, whereas images collected prior to the SLC failure are referred to as SLC-on
images (i.e., no data gaps exist). The malfunction of the SLC mirror assembly resulted in the loss
of approximately 22% of the normal scene area (Storey et al., 2005). The missing data affects
most of the image, with scan gaps varying in width from one pixel or less near the center of the
image to 14 pixels along the east and west edges of the image, creating a repeating wedge-
shaped pattern along the edges. The middle of the scene, approximately 22 km wide on a Level 1
product, contains very little duplication or data loss. Note that the SLC failure has no impact on
the radiometric performance with the valid pixels.
3.4. 
ALI sensor
The ALI has two onboard radiometric calibration devices: a lamp-based system and a
solar-diffuser with variable irradiance controlled by an aperture door. In addition to its onboard
calibrators, ALI has the ability to collect lunar and stellar observations for calibration purposes.
The ALI radiometric calibration procedure uses a fixed set of detector-by-detector gains
established shortly after launch and biases measured shortly after each scene acquisition by
closing the ALI's shutter. The calibration uncertainties of the ALI at-sensor spectral radiances are
t5% (Mendenhall & Lencioni, 2002). The ALI sensor is well-behaved and stable, with changes in
the response being less than 2% per year even early in the mission, and averaging, at most,
slightly more than 1 % per year over the full mission (Markham et al., 2006).
4. Conversion to at-sensor spectral radiance (Qca,-to- Lj
Calculation of at-sensor spectral radiance is the fundamental step in converting image
data from multiple sensors and platforms into a physically meaningful common radiometric scale.

Landsat MSS, TM, ETM+, and EO-1 ALI Sensors. (In Press, Remote Sensing of Environment, Manuscript Number: RSE-D-08-00684)
Radiometric calibration of the MSS, TM, ETM+, and ALI sensors involves resealing the raw digital
numbers (Q) transmitted from the satellite to calibrated digital numbers (Qcal) 5, which have the
same radiometric scaling for all scenes processed on the ground for a specific period.
During radiometric calibration, pixel values (Q) from raw, unprocessed image data are
converted to units of absolute spectral radiance using 32-bit floating-point calculations. The
absolute radiance values are then scaled to 7-bit (MSS, Qcalmax = 127), 8-bit (TM and ETM+,
Qcalmax = 255), and 16-bit (ALI, Qcalmax = 32767) numbers representing Qcal before output to
distribution media. Conversion from Q cal in Level 1 products back to at-sensor spectral radiance
(Li ) requires knowledge of the lower and upper limit of the original rescaling factors. The following
equation is used to perform the Qca l-to- L,, conversion for Level 1 products:
LIVL4XA — LMN ^ 1 
(( 
{7
+ LMIN,^
Qcalmax — Qcal min 1111

Where
L^ = Spectral radiance at the sensor's aperture [W/(m2 sr pm)]
Qcal = Quantized calibrated pixel value [DN]
Qcalmin = Minimum quantized calibrated pixel value corresponding to LMIN^ [DNj
Qcalmax = Maximum quantized calibrated pixel value corresponding to LMAX) [DNj
LMIN k = Spectral at-sensor radiance that is scaled to Q,:.lmin [W/(m2 sr pm)]
LMAX, = Spectral at-sensor radiance that is scaled to Qcalmax [W/(m 2 sr pm)]
Grescale = Band-specific rescaling gain factor [(W/(m2 sr pm))/ DN]
Brescale = Band-specific rescaling bias factor [W/(m2 sr pm)]
Historically, the MSS and TM calibration information is presented in spectral radiance
units of mW/(cm2 sr pm). To maintain consistency with ETM+ spectral radiance, units of W/(m 2 sr
pm) are now used for MSS and TM calibration information. The conversion factor is 1:10 when
'These are the DNs that users receive with Level 1 Landsat products.

converting from MW/ (cmz sr pm) units to W/ (mZ sr pm). Tables 2, 3, 4, and 5 summarize the
spectral range, post-calibration dynamic ranges 6 (LMINti and LMAX,, scaling parameters and the
corresponding rescaling gain [Gresaale]l and rescaling bias [Bresoalej values), and mean
exoatmospheric solar irradiance (ESUN A) for the MSS, TM, ETM+, and ALI sensors, respectively.
Tables 2-5 give the prelaunch "measured" (as-built performance) spectral ranges. These
numbers are slightly different from the original filter specification. The center wavelengths are the
average of the two spectral range numbers. Figures 1 and 2 show the Relative Spectral
Response (RSR) profiles of the Landsat MSS (Markham & Barker, 1983), TM (Markham &
Barker, 1986), ETM+ (Handbook'), and ALI (Mendenhall & Parker, 1999) sensors measured
during prelaunch characterization. The ETM+ spectral bands were designed to mimic the
standard TM spectral bands 1-7. The ALI bands were designed to mimic the six standard ETM+
solar reflective spectral bands 1-5, and 7; three new bands, 1p, 4p, and 5p, were added to more
effectively address atmospheric interference effects and specific applications. The ALI band
numbering corresponds with the ETM+ spectral bands. Bands not present on the ETM+ sensor
are given the "p," or prime, designation. MSS spectral bands are significantly different from TM
and ETM+ spectral bands.
The post-calibration dynamic ranges are band-specific rescaling factors typically provided
in the Level 1 product header file. Over the life of the Landsat sensors, occasional changes have
occurred in the post-calibration dynamic range. Future changes are anticipated, especially in the
MSS and TM data, because of the possible adjustment of the calibration constants based on
comparisons to absolute radiometric measurements made on the ground. In some cases, the
header file may have different rescaling factors than provided in the table included here. In these
cases, the user should use the header file information that comes with the product.
Two processing systems will continue to generate Landsat data products: the Level 1
Product Generation System (LPGS) and the National Land Archive Production System (NLAPS).
Starting December 8, 2008, all L7 ETM+ and L5 TM (except Thematic Mapper-Archive [TM-A]7
products) standard Level 1 products are processed through the LPGS, and all L4 TM and MSS
" The post-calibration dynamic ranges summarized in Tables 2-5 are only applicable to Landsat data processed and
distributed by the USGS EROS Center. The IGSs may process the data differently, and these rescaling factors may not
be applicable. "Special collections," such as the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium (MRLC) or Global Land
Survey (GLS), may have a different processing history, so the user needs to verify the respective product header
information.
' A small number of TM scenes were archived as radiometrically corrected products known as TM-A data. The TM-A data
are archived on a scene-by-scene basis (instead of intervals). The L4 and L5 TM-A scenes will continue to be processed
using NLAPS (with Q-,,.,;n =0), which attempts to uncalibrate the previously applied calibration and generates the product
using updated calibration procedures. Note that approximately 80 L4 TM and approximately 13,300 L5 TM scenes are
archived as TM-A data, with acquisition dates ranging between Sept. 1982 and Aug. 1990.

standard Level 1 products are processed through the NLAPS. The Landsat Program is working
toward transitioning the processing of all Landsat data to LPGS (Kline, personal communication).
In mid-2009, the processing of L4 TM data will transition from NLAPS to LPGS. The scenes
processed using LPGS include a header file (.MTL), which lists the LMIN A and LMAXA values but
not the rescaling gain and bias numbers. The scenes processed using NLAPS include a
processing history work order report (.WO), which lists the rescaling gain and bias numbers but
not the LMI NA, and LMAX),.
The sensitivity of the detector changes over time, causing a change in the detector gain
applied during radiometric calibration. However, the numbers presented in Tables 2-5 are the
rescaling factors, which are the post-calibration dynamic ranges. The LMIN A and LMAXA are a
representation of how the output Landsat Level 1 data products are scaled in at-sensor radiance
units. Generally, there is no need to change the LMIN A or LMAXA unless something changes
drastically on the sensor. Thus, there is no time dependence for any of the rescaling factors in
Tables 2-5.
5. Conversion to TOA reflectance (Lx-to- pp)
A reduction in scene-to-scene variability can be achieved by converting the at-sensor
spectral radiance to exoatmospheric TOA reflectance, also known as in-band planetary albedo.
When comparing images from different sensors, there are three advantages to using TOA
reflectance instead of at-sensor spectral radiance. First, it removes the cosine effect of different
solar zenith angles due to the time difference between data acquisitions. Second, TOA
reflectance compensates for different values of the exoatmospheric solar irradiance arising from
spectral band differences. Third, the TOA reflectance corrects for the variation in the Earth-Sun
distance between different data acquisition dates. These variations can be significant
geographically and temporally. The TOA reflectance of the Earth is computed according to the
equation:
;T-L, •d2
(2)
P — ESUN; • cos BS
where
pA = Planetary TOA reflectance [unitless]
iT = Mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159 [unitless]
LA =Spectral radiance at the sensor's aperture [W/(m 2 sr pm)]
d = Earth-Sun distance [astronomical units]
ESUN A = Mean exoatmospheric solar irradiance [W/(m 2 lam)]

05 = Solar zenith angle [degrees8]
Note that the cosine of the solar zenith angle is equal to the sine of the solar elevation
angle. The solar elevation angle at the Landsat scene center is typically stored in the Level 1
product header file (.MTL or .WO) or retrieved from the USGS EarthExplorer or GloVis online
interfaces under the respective scene metadata (these web sites also contain the acquisition time
in hours, minutes, and seconds). The reflectance calculation requires the Earth-Sun distance (d).
Table 6 presents d in astronomical units throughout a year generated using the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory (JPL) Ephemeris9 (DE405) data. The d numbers are also tabulated in the Nautical
Almanac.
The last column of Tables 2-5 summarizes solar exoatmospheric spectral irradiances
(ESUNJ for the MSS, TM, ETM+, and ALI sensors using the Thuillier solar spectrum (Thuillier et
al., 2003). The Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Working Group on Calibration
and Validation (WGCV) recommends 10 using this spectrum for applications in optical-based Earth
Observation that use an exoatmospheric solar irradiance spectrum. The Thuillier spectrum is
believed to be the most accurate and an improvement over the other solar spectrum. Note that
the CHKUR solar spectrum in MODTRAN 4.0 (Air Force Laboratory, 1998) was used previously
for ETM+ (Handbook) and TM (Chander & Markham, 2003), whereas the Neckel and Lab
(Neckel & Lab, 1984) and Igbal (Igbal, 1983) solar spectrums were used for MSS and TM solar
irradiance values (Markham & Barker, 1986). The primary differences occur in Bands 5 and 7.
For comparisons to other sensors, users need to verify that the same solar spectrum is used for
all sensors.
6. Conversion to at-sensor brightness temperature (Lk-to- T)
The thermal band data (Band 6 on TM and ETM+) can be converted from at-sensor
spectral radiance to effective at-sensor brightness temperature. The at-sensor brightness
temperature assumes that the Earth's surface is a black body (i.e., spectral emissivity is 1), and
includes atmospheric effects (absorption and emissions along path). The at-sensor temperature
uses the prelaunch calibration constants given in Table 7. The conversion formula from the at-
sensor's spectral radiance to at-sensor brightness temperature is:

T = Effective at-sensor brightness temperature [K]

The ETM+ Level 1 product has two thermal bands, one acquired using a low gain setting
(often referred to as Band 6L; useful temperature range of 130-350 K) and the other using a high
gain setting (often referred to as Band 6H; useful temperature range of 240-320 K). The noise
equivalent change in temperature (NEAT) at 280 K for ETM+ high gain is 0.22 and for low gain is
0.28. The TM Level 1 product has only one thermal band (there is no gain setting on the TM
sensor), and the thermal band images have a useful temperature range of 200-340 K. The NEAT
at 280 K for L5 TM is 0.17-0.30 (Barsi et al., 2003).
7. Conclusion
This paper provides equations and rescaling factors for converting Landsat calibrated
DNS to absolute units of at-sensor spectral radiance, TOA reflectance, and at-sensor brightness
temperature. It tabulates the necessary constants for the MSS, TM, ETM+, and ALI sensors in a
coherent manner using the same units and definitions. This paper forms a needed guide for
Landsat data users who now have access to the entire Landsat archive at no cost. Studies are
ongoing to evaluate the MSS calibration consistency and provide post-calibration adjustments of
the MSS sensors so they are consistent over time and consistent between sensors. Further
updates to improve the TM and ETM+ thermal band calibration are being investigated, as is the
calibration of the L4 TM.

Note 1: The 
= 0 for data processed using NLAPS. The 
= 1 for data processed using LPGS.
Note 2: The LMIN, is typically set to a small negative number, so a "zero radiance" target will be scaled to a small positive DN value,
even in the presence of sensor noise (typically I DN or less [1 sigma]). This value is usually not changed throughout the mission.
Note 3: In mid-2009, the processing of L4 TM data will transition from NLAPS to UPOS. NLAPS used IC-based calibration. The L4 TM
data processed by LPGS will be radiometrically calibrated using a new lifetime gain model procedure and revised calibration
parameters. Use the header file information that comes with the product and the above rescaling factors will not be applicable, The
numbers highlighted in grey are the revised (LMAX, = 163.0) post-calibration dynamic ranges for L4 TM Band 1 data acquired
between July 16,1982 (launch), and August 23,1986.
Note 4: The radiometric scaling coefficients for L5 TM Bands I and 2 for approximately the first eigH years ( 1 964-1991) of the
mission were changed to optimize the dynamic range and better preserve the sensitivity of the early mission data. The numbers
highlighted in grey are the revised (LMAX, = 1169,121, 333.0) post-calibration dynamic ranges for L5 TM Band 1 & 2 data acquired
between March 1, 1984 (launch), and December 31,1991 (Chander et al., 2007a)
