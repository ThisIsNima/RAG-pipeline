sequences are within membrane spanning segments and probably reflect only 
coincidental arrangements of the hydrophobic residues suited to this function. In 
contrast, the latter two sequences are both in polar hydrophilic regions of the 
proteins. The large extent of amino acid conservation (11 of 13 residues) implies 
some functional relation between these short segments of the primary structure of 
the Na' channel and CFTR. Similarities between sequences at the same relative 
locations with respect to the COOH-termini of the raf kinase and CFTR suggest 
that they may also share at least a small facet of their structures and functions.

Approximately 70 percent of the mutations in cystic 
fibrosis patients correspond to a specific deletion of three 
base pairs, which results in the loss of a phenylalanine 
residue at amino acid position 508 of the putative product 
of the cystic fibrosis gene. Extended haplotype data based 
on DNA markers closely linked to the putative disease 
gene locus suggest that the remainder of the cystic fibrosis 
mutant gene pool consists of multiple, different muta- 
tions. A small set of these latter mutant alleles (about 8 
percent) may confer residual pancreatic exocrine function 
in a subgroup of patients who are pancreatic sufficient. 
The ability to detect mutations in the cystic fibrosis gene 
at the DNA level has important implications for genetic 
diagnosis. 
A 
LTHOUGH THE FREQUENCY OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS (CF) IS 
not uniformly high among all Caucasian populations, a 
consensus estimate is that it occurs once in 2000 live births 
(1). On the basis of the autosomal recessive mode of inheritance for 
this disease, a mutant allele frequency of 0.022 may be derived. 
Several different mechanisms, including high mutation rate (2),

heterozygote advantage (3), genetic drift (4), multiple loci (5), and 
reproductive compensation (6), have been proposed in attempts to 
explain the high incidence and, indirectly, the nature of the CF 
mutations. Although some of these hypotheses could not be further 
addressed because of the lack of knowledge about the basic defect in 
CF, several important observations have been made during the past 
few years through genetic analysis of the families of affected 
individuals (7-20). 
Extensive linkage analysis provides evidence for the existence of a 
single CF locus on human chromosome 7 (region q31) (7-10, 21). 
The detection of allelic and haplotype association between the CF

locus (CF) and closely linked DNA markers further suggests a small 
number of mutations in CF (12-16, 19). A single mutational event 
may account for most CF mutations in Northern European popula- 
tions (12); another mutation appears to be prevalent in some 
Southern European populations (15). Additional haplotype data 
indicate that there could be several other mutations (15, 16, 19, 20). 
The two clinical subgroups of CF patients, those with pancreatic 
insufficiency (CF-PI) and those with pancreatic sufficiency (CF-PS), 
can be explained by different mutations on the basis of family studies 
(18) and haplotype data (19, 20). Patients with CF-PI, which 
constitute the larger proportion (about 85 percent) of the CF 
population, appear to be genetically more homogeneous than those 
with CF-PS (about 15 percent); most individuals with CF-PS 
appear to be compound heterozygotes (19). We must emphasize, 
however, that these studies were based on linked DNA markers 
whose exact relation to CF was not entirely certain. Further 
understanding of the pathophysiology, haplotype association, and 
population distribution of CF would require detailed molecular 
knowledge about the mutations. 
The extensive genetic and physical mapping data made it possible 
for molecular cloning studies to be focused on a small segment of 
DNA on chromosome 7 (12, 13, 17, 21, 22). A putative CF gene has 
now been identified through chromosome walking and jumping 
(23) and cDNA clones have been isolated and characterized (24). 
Because of the lack of chromosome deletions and rearrangements in 
CF and the lack of a well-developed functional assay for the CF gene 
product, the identification of the CF locus required a detailed 
characterization of the locus itself and comparison between the CF 
and normal (N) alleles. Random, phenotypically normal, individuals 
could not be included as controls in the comparison because of the 
high frequency of symptomless carriers in the population. As a 
result, only parents of CF patients, each of whom by definition 
carries an N and a CF chromosome, were suitable for the analysis. 
Moreover, because of the strong allelic association observed be- 
tween CF and some of the closely linked DNA markers (12-15, 21), 
it was necessary to exclude the possibility that sequence differences 
detected between N and CF were polymorphisms associated with 
the disease locus. 
Identification of RFLP's and family studies. To determine the 
relation of each of the DNA segments isolated from the chromo- 
some walking and jumping experiments to CF, restriction fragment 
length polymorphisms (RFLP's) were identified and used to study 
families where crossover events between CF and other flanking 
DNA markers had previously been detected (25, 26). In all, 18 
RFLP's were detected in the 500-kb region of chromosome 7; 17 of 
them (from E6 to CE 1.0) are listed in Table 1; some of them 
corresponded to markers previously reported (12, 13). Five of the 
RFLP's were identified with cDNA and genomic DNA probes 
derived from the putative CF locus, namely 10-1X.6, T6/20, H1.3, 
and CE1.0 (23, 24). The RFLP data (Table 1) are presented with 
markers in the regions of MET and D7S8 included for comparison. 
The physical distances between these markers as well as their relation 
to MET and D7S8 are shown in Fig. 1. 
Because families with informative crossovers only gradually be- 
came available [through the courtesy of investigators (27)] over the 
course of the study, not all the DNA markers were examined in these 
families (28). The recombination breakpoints were localized for the 
two families [out of four that showed a crossover between D7S23 
and CF (26)] that were informative for the DNA markers tested. 
One of them showed a crossover between the sites defined by 
JG2E1 (also known as KM19) and E2.6 (29), and the other 
between JG2E1 and E4.1 (Mp6d.9) (30) (Fig. 1). These results 
indicated that CF mapped to the telomeric side of JG2E1. The two 
other families were not informative in the analysis. Only a single 
1074 
family (SLC1380) was documented to show a recombination event 
between CF and D7S8 (25), and more recently the crossover point 
was narrowed to between CF and D7S424, a jump clone derived 
from D7S8 (31); no crossover was detected with the above- 
described DNA markers in this family. CF was therefore delimited 
to the region between JG2E1 and D7S424, spanning less than 900 
kb (Fig. 1). Because of the small number of recombinant families 
available for the analysis, which was expected from the close distance 
between the markers and CF, and because of the possibility of 
misdiagnosis, alternative approaches were necessary in further fine 
mapping of the CF locus.

*The number of N and CF-PI (CF with pancreatic insufficiency) chromosomes was 
derived from the parents in the families used in our linkage analysis (36). 
tStandard- 
ized association (A), which is less influenced by the fluctuation of DNA marker allele 
distribution among the N chromosomes, is used here for the comparison. Yule's 
association coefficient (A) = (ad - bc)/(ad + bc), where a, b, c, and d are the numbers of 
N chromosomes with DNA marker allele 1, CF with 1, N with 2, and CF with 2, 
respectively. Relative risk can be calculated from the relation RR - (1 + A)/( 1 - A) or 
its reverse. 
tLAllelic association (A), calculated according to (33) on the basis of a 
frequency of 0.02 for CF chromosomes in the population, is included for compari- 
son.

Fig. 1. Map of the RFLP's closely linked to the CF locus. Details of the RFLP's are shown in Table 1. The 
inverted triannle indicat.es -the location of the AFR- mutation. 
has been detected for many closely linked DNA markers (32, 33). 
Although the utility of using allelic association for measuring 
genetic distance is uncertain, an overall correlation has been ob- 
served between CF and the flanking DNA markers. A strong 
association with CF was noted for the closer DNA markers D7S23 
(12, 14) and D7S122 (13), whereas little or no association was 
detected for the more distant markers MET, D7S8, or D7S424 (21, 
31; Fig. 1). 
The degree of association between DNA markers and CF (as 
measured by the Yule's association coefficient) increased from 0.35 
for metH and 0.17 for J32 to 0.91 for 10- IX.6 [only CF-PI families 
were used in the analysis as they appeared to be genetically more 
homogeneous than CF-PS (19)]. The association coefficients ap- 
peared to be rather constant over the 300-kb interval between 
EGI.4 and H1.3; the fluctuations detected at several locations, most 
notably at H2.3A, E4.1, and T6/20, were probably due to the 
variation in the allelic distribution among the N chromosomes 
(Table 1). These data are therefore consistent with the result from 
the study of recombinant families (Fig. 1). A similar conclusion 
could also be made by inspection of the extended DNA marker 
haplotypes associated with the CF chromosomes (as discussed 
below). However, the strong allelic association detected over the 
large physical distance between EG1.4 and H1.3 did not allow 
further refined mapping of the CF locus. Since J44 was the last 
genomic DNA clone isolated by chromosome walking and jumping 
before a cDNA clone was identified (24), the strong allelic associa- 
tion detected for the JG2E1-J44 interval prompted us to search for 
candidate gene sequences over this entire interval. The highest 
degree of allelic association was in fact detected between CF and the 
two RFLP's detected by 10-1X.6, a region near the major CF 
mutation. 
Strong allelic association was also detected among subgroups of 
RFLP's on both the CF and N chromosomes, namely, between 
adjacent markers E6 and E7, between pH131 and W3D1.4, be- 
tween the Acc I and Hae III polymorphic sites detected by 10-1X.6 
and among EG1.4, JG2E1, E2.6 (E.9), H2.8, and E4.1 (34). The 
two groups of distal markers in the MET and D7S8 regions also 
showed some degree of linkage disequilibrium among themselves, 
but they showed little association with markers from E6 to CELO, 
consistent with the distant locations for MET and D7S8. The lack of 
association between DNA markers that are physically close may 
indicate the presence of recombination hot spots (33, 34). Examples 
of these potential hot spots are the region between E7 and pH131, 
around H2.3A, and between J44 and the regions covered by the 
probes 10-1X.6 and T6/20 (Fig. 1). These regions, containing 
frequent recombination breakpoints, were useful in the subsequent 
analysis of extended haplotype data for the CF region. 
The major CF mutation. Molecular cloning experiments have 
allowed us to identify a gene in the J44-D7S424 interval (23, 24).

and nucleotide binding (24). Comparison of the nucleotide se- 
quences of the cDNA clones derived from N and CF individuals 
revealed a 3-bp deletion in the CF gene, resulting in the loss of a 
single phenylalanine residue (position 508) in the predicted amino 
acid sequence (24). 
To investigate the proportion of CF patients carrying this dele- 
tion (AFso8), we used genomic DNA samples from patients and 
their parents. Each sample was amplified with oligonucleotide 
primers flanking the mutation in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
(35) and hybridized to 32P-labeled oligonucleotides specific for the 
normal and the putative mutant sequences (Fig. 2). The result of 
this analysis showed that 68 percent (145/214) of CF chromosomes 
in the general patient population had the AF508 mutation (Table 2). 
In contrast, none (0/198) of the N chromosomes had the deletion 
(Table 2) (X2 = 207, P < 10-57.5!), suggesting that this sequence 
alteration is specific to CF and that it is the major mutation causing 
the disease. No recombination has been detected between the AF508 
mutation site and CF. However, the possibility that this sequence 
difference corresponded to a tightly linked DNA polymorphism had 
yet to be excluded. 
Haplotype analysis. Extended haplotypes based on 23 DNA 
markers were generated for the CF and N chromosomes in the 
collection of families previously used for linkage analysis (36). 
Assuming recombination between chromosomes of different haplo-

tNumber of chromosomes scored in each class: CF-PI(AF508), CF chromosomes from 
CF-PI patients with the AF508 mutation; CF-PS(AF508), CF chromosomes from CF-PS 
patients with the AF508 mutation; CF-PI (others), other CF chromosomes from CF-PI 
patients; CF-PS (others), other CF chromosomes from CF-PS patients; N, normal 
chromosomes derived from carrier parents. 
*The extended haplotype data are 
derived from the CF families used in previous linkage studies (36) with additional CF- 
PS families collected subsequently (19). The data are shown in groups (regions) to 
reduce space. The regions are assigned primarily according to pairwise association data 
(34) with regions 6 to 8 spanning the putative CF locus. The AF508 mutation is located 
between region 6 and 7. A dash (-) is shown at the region where the haplotype has not 
been determined because of incomplete data or inability to establish phase. Alternative 
haplotype assignments are also given where data are incomplete. Unclassified includes 
those chromosomes with more than three unknown assignments. The haplotype 
definitions for each of the nine regions are shown below; 1 refers to the larger allele of 
the RFLP; 2 refers to the smaller allele.

CF chromosomes and, also, to predict the location of the disease 
locus (34, 37). 
To obtain further information useful for understanding the nature 
of different CF mutations, AF508 was correlated with the extended 
DNA marker haplotypes (37). Five major groups of N and CF 
haplotypes could be defined by the RFLP's within or immediately 
adjacent to the putative CF locus (regions 6 to 8) (Table 3). Most 
recombinations between haplotypes occurred between regions 1 and 
2 and between 8 and 9, again in good agreement with the relatively 
long physical distance between these regions. Other less frequent 
breakpoints occurred between short distance intervals, and they 
generally corresponded to the hot spots identified by pairwise allelic 
association studies (34). A striking result of our study is that AF508 
associated almost exclusively with group I, the most frequent CF 
haplotype, consistent with our hypothesis that this deletion consti- 
tutes the major mutation in CF. More important, while AF508 was 
detected in 89 percent (62/70) of the CF chromosomes with the AA 
haplotype (corresponding to regions 6 and 7 flanking the deletion), 
no deletions were found in the 14 N chromosomes within the same 
group (X2 = 47.3, p < 10-4). 
The AF508 mutation is therefore not a 
common sequence polymorphism associated with the core of the 
group I haplotype (Table 3). 
One of the CF chromosomes, detected by the specific oligonucle- 
otide probe for AF508, belonged to a different haplotype group 
(group III). None of the nine other CF chromosomes or 17 N 
chromosomes within group III hybridized to the probe. This 
specific hybridization result suggests that the mutation harbored on 
this chromosome is similiar to AF508. Although recombination or 
gene conversion are possible mechanisms to explain the presence of 
this deletion on a haplotype that did not belong with group I, it is 
more likely that this group III chromosome represents a recurrent 
mutation event, a situation similar to the s and 1E mutations at the 
3-globin locus (38). Together, the results of the oligonucleotide 
hybridization study and the haplotype analysis provide a strong 
indication that the gene locus described above is the CF locus and 
that the 3-bp deletion (AF508) is the most common mutation in CF. 
Other CF mutations. Haplotype association with specific muta- 
tions has been demonstrated in studies of other genetic disorders 
(39). As indicated by these examples, knowledge of the haplotypes 
associated with the disease chromosomes facilitates studies on the 
molecular defects of each of the respective mutations. 
The association of AF508 with one common and one rare CF 
haplotype provided further insight into the number of mutational 
events that could contribute to the present patient population. On 
the basis of the extensive haplotype data, the two original chromo- 
somes in which the AF508 mutation occurred are likely to carry the 
haplotype -AAAAAAA- (group Ia) and -CBAACBA- 
(group 
Ila), as defined (Table 3). The other CF chromosomes in group I 
carrying the deletion are probably recombination products derived 
from the original chromosome. If the CF chromosomes in each 
haplotype group are considered to be derived from the same origin, 
only three to four additional mutational events would be predicted 
(Table 3); however, since many of the CF chromosomes in the same 
group are different from each other, further subdivision within each 
group is possible. As a result, a greater number of independent 
mutational events can be considered, and the data suggest that at 
least seven additional, putative mutations also contribute to the CF- 
PI phenotype. The mutations leading to the CF-PS subgroup are 
probably more heterogeneous and are considered below. 
The seven additional CF-PI mutations are represented by the 
haplotypes: -CAAAAAA- (group Ib), -CABCAAD- 
(group Ic), 
-- -BBBAC- (group Iha), -CABBBAB- (group JIb), - --AACBA- 
(group IIIb), -AABBCBA-- (group IIIc), and -CBBBCAC- (group 
V) . Although the molecular defect in each of these mutations has yet

show the hybridization results of genomic DNA 
from representative CF families with the two 
specific oligonucleotide 
probes as indicated. 
Oligo-N detects the normal DNA sequence and 
oligo-AF detects the mutant sequence. Genomic 
DNA sample from each family member was am- 
plified by PCR (35), and the products were 
separated by electrophoresis on a 1.4 percent 
agarose gel, and transferred to Zetaprobe (Bio- 
Rad) membrane according to standard proce- 
dures. The membrane was hybridized with 32P- 
labeled oligonucleotide probes, washed, and ex- 
posed to Kodak XAR film as described (35). 
Samnles without DNA (H1O) and niasmid DNA 
T16 (N cDNA) and C16 (cDNA with the AF508 deletion), were included as 
controls. AF is the abbreviation for AF508. Families B, D, E, and H are CF-PI 
(diagnosis for the other families not available). The illustration is based on 
the assumption that the triplet CIT was deleted; the sequencing data do not 
allow distinction between deletion of these nucleotides or other combinations.

*Allele designations: AFSO, the 3-bp deletion; S. uncharacterized 
severe mutant alleles; 
M, uncharacterized 
mild mutant alleles. 
tAssuming that the CF-PT mutant pheno- 
type is recessive to the CF-PS mutant phenotype, the frequency of CF-PT mutant alleles, 
including the 3-bp deletion, could be estimated from the observed prortion of CF-PT 
patients in our CF clinic (18), that is, (0.85)/2 = 0.92. The observed allele frequency for 
AFw in the total CF population is 0.68 (Table 2); the frequency for S is 0.92 - 0.68 = 
0.24; the frequency for M is 1 -0.92 = 0.08. The frequency for each genotype was then 
calculated from the Hardy-Weinberg law. 
tThe number of CF-PT and CF-PS 
patients in each category was obtained by oligonucleotide hybridization analysis as 
illustrated 
in Fig. 2. The patients were from the CF families used in our linkage analysis 
(36) with 14 additional CF-PS patients or families from a subsequent study 
(19). 
?The expected numbers were calculated for CF-PT and CF-PS after normaliza- 
tion within each group. The x2 of fit is 0.86, df = 3, 0.74 < P < 0.90. 
lIThis 
number is higher than would be expected (15 observed compared to 9.6) if AF508 is in 
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium among all CF chromosomes (X2 = 6.48, df = 1; P < 
0.011). 
to be defined, none of these mutations severely affect the region 
corresponding to the oligonucleotide binding sites used in the PCR- 
hybridization experiment (Fig. 2 and legend). 
Pancreatic sufficiency. CF-PS is defined clinically as sufficient 
pancreatic exocrine function for digestion of food; however, the 
level of residual pancreatic enzyme activity varies among patients (1, 
40). Our previous haplotype data suggested that the CF-PI and CF- 
PS patients have different mutant alleles (19). Although the basic 
biochemical defect in CF has yet to be defined, it is possible that the 
residual pancreatic enzyme activity in CF-PS patients is a direct 
reflection of the activity of the mutant CF gene product. Thus, the 
residual exocrine function conferred by a mild (CF-PS) allele, 
although much lower than that of the normal gene product, would 
constitute a dominant phenotype over that of more severe (CF-PI) 
mutations with little or no function. Therefore, only patients 
carrying two copies of severe alleles would be CF-PI and patients 
carrying one or two mild alleles would be CF-PS. 
To test this hypothesis, we used the information on the propor- 
tion of CF patients carrying the AF508 deletion. If we assume that a 
severe mutation is recessive to a mild mutation and a distribution of 
CF alleles among the patient population according to the Hardy- 
1078 
Weinberg law, the frequency could be estimated to be -0.92 for the 
severe alleles and -0.08 for the mild alleles (M) (Table 4). Since 
most CF-PI patients were homozygous for AF508, it was reasonable 
to assume that this mutation corresponded to one of the severe 
alleles. Given the observed frequency of AF508 (0.68) in the studied 
CF population (Table 2), the frequency of the remaining severe 
alleles could be derived. The proportion of AF508AF508, SS, MM, 
AF508S, AF508M, and SM patients was then calculated. Since 
individuals with SM and MM could not be distinguished phenotypi- 
cally or genotypically, they were combined in the analysis. The 
observed frequencies for all five groups of patients were as expected 
from this hypothesis (Table 4). 
The above analysis thus provides strong support for our hypothe- 
sis that CF-PI is due to the presence of two severe alleles and that a 
CF-PS patient carries either a single severe allele or two mild alleles. 
This model also explains the lower frequency of AF508 in the CF-PS 
than in the CF-PI population and the excess number of CF-PS 
patients with one copy of the deletion (Table 4). 
Given the predicted dominant phenotype conferred by the M 
alleles, it was necessary to examine the CF chromosomes in CF-PS 
patients individually in order to identify those carrying the M alleles. 
Five of the seven representative CF-PS patients carry one copy of the 
AF508 deletion; at least five different haplotypes could be assigned to 
the other CF chromosomes (Table 5). These latter observations 
further support our previous suggestion that the majority of CF-PS 
patients are compound heterozygotes (19). Further delineation of 
these and other CF haplotypes observed in our study would require 
a larger patient population or a more detailed characterization of CF 
mutations (or both). 
Meconium ileus (MI), which occurs in 5 to 10 percent of 
newborns with CF, is generally ascribed to failure of pancreatic 
enzyme secretion and digestion of intraluminal contents in utero 
(1). Although only six patients were identified to have MI in our 
study (41), all of them belong to the CF-PI subgroup, five of them 
homozygous and one heterozygous for AF508 (Table 5). It is 
therefore tempting to speculate that homozygous AF508 (or equiva- 
lent severe mutations) may be a prerequisite for development of MI. 
Moreover, since MI only occurs in a small proportion of CF patients 
and with only 30 percent concordance within families (42), it is 
probable that this condition is also determined by other genetic or 
nongenetic factors. 
Implications for genetic diagnosis. Previous DNA-based genet- 
ic testing for CF has only been available to families with affected 
children and to their close relatives (14, 43). Knowledge of the CF 
mutations at the DNA sequence level should permit testing any 
random individual. On the basis of our estimate (Table 4), 46

percent of CF patients without a previous family history can be 
accurately diagnosed by DNA analysis, and 68 percent of the CF 
carriers in the population can be identified with a probe specific for 
the AF508 mutation. It will be necessary to define most of the 
existing CF mutations before an effective DNA-based genetic 
testing program can be implemented at the population level. 
Since the AF508 mutation constitutes about 68 percent of all CF 
mutations, RFLP analysis may be used to supplement genetic 
diagnosis by direct deletion detection. About 55 percent of the CF 
parents not carrying the AF508 mutation are expected to be informa- 
tive for the DNA marker JG2E1 based on retrospective analysis of 
our CF linkage families (36); an additional 39 percent would be 
informative if E6 (Taq I) and J3.11(Msp I) were also tested; 
virtually all parents would be informative if H2.3A (XV2C-Taq I), 
E2.6(E.9-Msp I), E4.1 (Mp6d.9-Msp I), J44 (Xba I), and metD 
(Ban I) were included. Clearly, more accurate and simple testing 
procedures will be developed when additional CF mutations are 
identified. 
As indicated above, variation of DNA marker haplotype associa- 
tion in CF has been detected among different European populations 
(9, 15). Whether the haplotype classifications proposed here corre- 
late with geographic distributions remains to be determined. Our 
preliminary study showed that all seven CF chromosomes in group 
Ib (Table 3) were from individuals of French-Canadian ancestry 
(44). It is unexpected that at least two independent mutational 
events had occurred on a haplotype (groups Ia and Ib) that is rare 
among the N chromosomes. A detailed description of such haplo- 
types would be usefull for understanding the high incidence of CF in 
the Caucasian population (44) and for further mutational analysis. 
Further, a complete molecular description of all the CF mutations 
should provide important insight into the pathophysiology of the 
8 SEPTEMBER 1989 
disease and form the basis for the development of improved 
treatment.

ture was 37C. The membranes were washed twice at room temperature with 5x SSC 
and twice at 390C with 2x SSC (lx SCC is 150 mM NaCl and 15 mM sodium 
citrate). Autoradiography was performed at room temperature overnight. 
36. The families used for linkage analysis were described by L.-C. Tsui, S. Zcngerling, 
H. F. Willard, M. Buchwald, Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 51, 325 
(1986). Haplotypes for N and CF parental chromosomes were constructed by 
irspection of the patient chromosomes in these families.

CF families were from the Chicoutnii Clinic, 
Quebec; likewise, terms such as Northern European refer only to geographic 
distribution.
