The China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) is a
nationally representative longitudinal survey of persons in China 45
years of age or older and their spouses, including assessments of
social, economic, and health circumstances of community-residents.
CHARLS examines health and economic adjustments to rapid ageing
of the population in China. The national baseline survey for the
study was conducted between June 2011 and March 2012 and
involved 17 708 respondents. CHARLS respondents are followed
every 2 years, using a face-to-face computer-assisted personal inter-
view (CAPI). Physical measurements are made at every 2-year
follow-up, and blood sample collection is done once in every two
follow-up periods. A pilot survey for CHARLS was conducted in two
provinces of China in 2008, on 2685 individuals, who were resur-
veyed in 2012. To ensure the adoption of best practices and interna-
tional comparability of results, CHARLS was harmonized with
leading
international
research
studies
in
the
Health
and
Retirement Study (HRS) model. Requests for collaborations should
be directed to Dr Yaohui Zhao (yhzhao@nsd.edu.cn). All data in
CHARLS are maintained at the National School of Development of
Peking University and will be accessible to researchers around the
world at the study website. The 2008 pilot data for CHARLS are
available at: http://charls.ccer.edu.cn/charls/. National baseline data
for the study are expected to be released in January 2013.
Why was the cohort set up?
The importance of research on ageing is recognized
worldwide,
where
numerous
high-quality
surveys
modelled after the US Health and Retirement Study
(HRS) are ongoing.1 Developing countries, especially
in Asia, are experiencing rapid changes in demo-
graphics and health as the elderly population becomes
more prominent and the nature of health problems
changes from infectious to chronic diseases. Until
recently,
few
panel
surveys
have
focused
on
ageing-related issues in developing countries in Asia,
especially in the case of surveys similar to the HRS in
design and content.
With respect to ageing, China is arguably the most
important developing country in the world. Not only
does it have the world’s largest elderly population, but
because of increases in longevity and especially reduc-
tions in fertility, China’s population is ageing rapidly.
It is projected that the proportion of persons 60 years
of age and older will increase from 10% of the popu-
lation in 2000 to about 30% in 2050.2 China’s elderly
support ratio (the number of prime-age adults from

25 to 64 years of age divided by the number older
than 64 years) is projected to fall from nearly 13 in
2000 to 2.1 by 2050. China has also been ageing at a
much lower level of national income than have
European countries.1
With the introduction of economic reforms directed
toward the achievement of a market economy, China
faces unique problems in supporting its elderly popu-
lation. Many recent changes made in social-security
policies have unknown implications for the welfare of
the elderly. There has also been a rapid expansion in
the provision of health insurance, the most successful
one being the New Cooperative Medical Scheme
(NCMS), which was introduced in 2003 in the rural
areas. The Ministry of Health of China claims that
more than 97% of the rural population of the country
participated in NCMS in 2011.3 Studying the effects of
these policies will yield insights that may be relevant
for other developing countries.4
CHARLS is a nationally representative longitudinal
survey of the middle-aged and elderly population of
China, consisting of persons 45 years of age or older,
and including assessments of the social, economic,
and health circumstances of community residents. It
is intended to provide a high-quality public micro-
database with a wide range of information serving
the
needs
of
scientific
and
policy
research
on
ageing-related issues. CHARLS was harmonized with
leading international research studies to ensure a
cross-study comparability of results.
Who is in the cohort?
The national baseline survey for CHARLS was con-
ducted between June 2011 and March 2012 and
included
17 708
individual
participants.
Samples
were chosen through multistage probability sampling.
In the first stage, 150 county-level units were ran-
domly chosen with a probability-proportional-to-size
(PPS) sampling technique from a sampling frame
containing all county-level units with the exception
of Tibet. The sample was stratified by region and
within region by urban districts or rural counties
and per capita statistics on gross domestic product
(GDP). The final sample of 150 counties fell within
28 provinces. Our sample used the lowest level of
government organization, consisting of administrative
villages
(cun)
in
rural
areas
and
neighborhoods
(shequ or juweihui) in urban areas, as primary sam-
pling units (PSUs). We selected 3 PSUs within each
county-level unit, using PPS sampling.
Because no pre-existing sampling frame of residents
existed, we conducted mapping and listing operations
within each village-level unit to obtain the sampling
frame for CHARLS. We excluded collective dwellings
such as military bases, schools, dormitories, nursing
homes, and domestic helpers living in the homes of
employers. Migrants living in factory dormitories or
employers’ homes were sampled in their homes of
origin as household members living in collective
dwellings away from home.
If more than one household was found within each
dwelling unit, we randomly selected a household with
a member 39 years of age or older. If the chosen
household had more than one age-eligible member,
we randomly selected one of them. If the selected
person was between 39 and 45 years of age that
person was designated for inclusion in a future re-
freshment sample and was not interviewed. If the
chosen person was 45 years of age or older, we inter-
viewed both that person and his or her spouse. All
stages of the sampling were conducted by computer
to avoid human manipulation.
The survey assigned 23 422 dwelling units to inter-
viewers. After excluding empty or non-resident dwell-
ings, 12 740 were age-eligible for CHARLS. Final CAPI
interviews were conducted on 10 257 households,
which completed at least one module of the survey
beyond the cover screening for age eligibility. Dividing
this number by the numbers of age-eligible house-
holds for the survey gives a response rate of 80.5%.
Of the 19.5% rate of nonresponse, 8.8% was due to
refusal to respond, 8.2% to the inability of inter-
viewers to contact sample residents, and 2.0% to
other reasons (e.g., the resident was willing to be
interviewed but could not do so for health- or for
interviewer-related reasons).
Of the final sample of 17 708 individual participants
who provided CAPI interview data, 10 069 were main
respondents randomly selected after the randomiza-
tion procedures for the survey, and 7639 were spouses
of main respondents. The survey included 14 910
spousal pairs (in 184 cases the main respondents
did not participate in the interview but the spouses
did). Among all study participants, 13 978 individuals
(78.9%)
provided
anthropometric
and
physical-
performance measures. With funding from Chinese
sources, and after the household interviews in a
county or district had been completed, respondents
were invited to township hospitals or to a local
office of China Center for Disease Prevention and
Control (CDC), where trained nurses drew 8-ml sam-
ples of fasting blood. Tests for a complete blood count
(CBC) were conducted within 1–2 hours of sample
collection. A specimen of whole blood was stored
during transport at 48C for later testing of haemoglo-
bin A1C (HbA1C), and the remainder of the blood
sample was separated into plasma and red blood
cells at the same time at which the CBC was done
and was stored for transport at 208C. All blood sam-
ples were shipped back to Beijing and stored at –708C
at the China CDC for analysis. Blood collection for the
study is continuing in the field, with 10 916 study
participants having so far donated blood. A flow dia-
gram including response rates for each part of the
study is shown in Figure 1.

because
of
illness
or

unreachable because of migration, we allowed a proxy
interview, in which a knowledgeable person answered
on behalf of the originally designated respondent. We
minimized such proxy responses by requiring that the
survey interviewer call the study headquarters to re-
quest permission for a proxy response, and upon ap-
proval a password was given to proceed. The national
baseline rate of proxy interviews was 8.02%. Of such
proxy interviews, 64% were conducted because a re-
spondent
was
living
away
from
home,
25%
for
health-related reasons, and 11% for other reasons.
In follow-up surveys the rate of proxy interviews
will decline because migrants will be interviewed at
their destination. In financial questions, we mini-
mized
the frequency of
nonresponses
to specific
items by using unfolding brackets.
Table 1 compares weighted demographic data for
age structure and marital status in CHARLS with cor-
responding data in the Chinese population census of
2010. In terms of these two variables, CHARLS is
quite similar to the Chinese national population.
Before the national baseline survey for CHARLS was
conducted, a pilot survey for the study was conducted
in 2008 in the two provinces of Zhejiang and Gansu.
In
this
pilot
survey,
which
followed
the
same
sampling procedure outlined above, 2685 individuals
in 1750 households were interviewed by CAPI, yield-
ing a response rate of 85%. A follow-up survey of this
sample was conducted in the summer of 2012 with an
individual response rate of 93%. The procedures for
the follow-up of the pilot-survey respondents will be
used to guarantee a successful follow-up of the
national baseline sample for CHARLS in 2013 and
beyond.
What does CHARLS cover?
CHARLS is a comprehensive study and includes:
 Comparisons of self-reported and objective meas-
ures of health among middle-aged and elderly in
China, and of changes in health with age.
 Interactions of socio-economic factors and health-
related behaviors and health outcomes in the
process of ageing.
 A study of the effects of childhood circumstances
and community environment on health later in life.
 Sex differences in conditions of mental, cognitive
and physical health.
 Descriptions by respondents of their current eco-
nomic positions, social and family support, health
insurance, and health-care utilization.
 Follow-up interviews will monitor how respon-
dents’
health,
economic,
and
social
conditions
change over time and how respondents adjust to
these changes.
What has been measured?
We sent two interviewers to each county-level unit to
interview about 72 households located in three com-
munities. The interviewers were trained at Peking
University by CHARLS staff members, and the inter-
views took place in respondents’ homes with the use
of CAPI technology.
Core CHARLS questionnaires include sections dir-
ected at: demographics, family structure and changes,
health status and functioning, general health now
and before age 16, physician-diagnosed chronic ill-
nesses,
lifestyle
and
health-related
behaviors
(smoking, drinking, physical activities), subjective ex-
pectation of mortality, activities of daily living (ADL),
instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), helpers,
cognition
testing,
depression

short form], health vignettes, health care and insur-
ance, work, retirement and pension, income and con-
sumption, and assets (individual and household)
(Table 2).
The interviewers who conducted the county-level
interviews described above also carried equipment
for and conducted measurements of health function-
ing and performance in respondents’ households.

aAs a legacy of the centralized planning era, every Chinese is assigned a registration, or hukou, status in a specific locality
indicating whether he/she is an agricultural or non-agricultural resident. This identity has implications for social benefits entitle-
ments and is widely considered to inhibit geographical mobility.

These included the anthropometric measurements of
height, weight, waist circumference, lower right leg
length and arm length, lung capacity, grip strength,
speed of repeated chair stand, blood pressure, walking
speed, and balance tests (Table 3).
Detailed community-level information was collected
in the county-level interviews. This included informa-
tion on community area size, population, and demo-
graphic
structure;
prices
of
foodstuffs,
fuel,
and
housing; distance to health-care facilities commonly
used by residents; premium for and participation
rate in community-based health insurance programs;
natural disasters in the preceding 5 years (frequency,
timing of the most recent disaster and number of
injuries and deaths); and the three most severe nat-
ural disasters or epidemics since 1947 (beginning and
ending year, number and percent of injured or dead,
percent loss in agricultural output relative to that in a
normal year).
How often will the respondents
be followed?
CHARLS respondents are followed every 2 years
through
a
face-to-face
CAPI
interview.

measurements are conducted at every follow up and
blood-sample collection is done once in every two
follow-up cycles. Funding has already been secured
for a second wave of follow-up interviews in 2013,
and
is
currently
being
sought
for
subsequent
follow-ups.
What has been found?
Several publications have come from the CHARLS
2008
pilot
data,
including
chapters
in
a
recent
volume published by the U.S. National Academy of
Science.5 Because the 2011–2012 baseline data are na-
tionally representative, prevalence rates are of interest
(Table 4). Both overweight and underweight are prob-
lems for Chinese elderly persons, the rate of under-
diagnosis of hypertension is high, and rural residents
and women in the Chinese population have poorer
health in almost all categories (physical and mental
health and cognition)6 than do urban residents and
men. Strong socioeconomic gradients were found in
many
dimensions
of
health,
as
also
was
an
underdiagnosis of diseases. The baseline data reveal
nearly universal coverage with health insurance, but
large
differences
remain
in
the
generosity
of
reimbursement.7
The baseline data for CHARLS show that height is
inversely associated with socioeconomic condition and
positively associated with poor health outcomes across
many
categories,
especially
cognition.8
CHARLS
reveals large sex-related differences in cognition to
the disadvantage of women (Table 5), with the large
sex-related gap in education being the primary reason
for this.9 These sex-related disparities are eliminated
in younger cohorts. There is strong transmission of
childhood health status into adulthood.10
Although 60% of elderly people do not live with any
adult
children,
they
are
not
isolated
from their
families.11 Most have at least one child living within
the same county, resolving the conflict between inde-
pendence/privacy and family support. Transfers are crit-
ical for reducing poverty rates. The poverty rate for
persons 60 years of age and older, based on respondent
and spouse income, is reduced by about one third after
the inclusion of public and private transfers.
What are the main strengths and
weaknesses of the study?
CHARLS provides nationally representative panel data
that enable inferences to be made about the Chinese
population 45 years of age and older. The survey in-
strument was developed on the basis of the best inter-
national practices and was harmonized with more
than 25 HRS type surveys in the world, thereby per-
mitting international comparisons of the findings in
CHARLS with those in other studies. The CHARLS
research team is familiar with Chinese institutions
and
adapted
the
instrument
to
capture
Chinese
specifics.
CHARLS instruments cover life domains essential for
the well-being of middle-aged and elderly Chinese

persons, including health and the provision of health
care, economic resources, work, and relations between
generations within a family. Health is measured in
three
ways,
through:
(i)
a
question-and-answer
CAPI instrument, (ii) assays of venous blood, and
(iii) tests of physical performance. The latter two are
essential in China, where a large proportion of disease
is undiagnosed. CHARLS will be conducted as a
panel survey that will permit researchers to conduct
analyses of changes with time in the lives and
conditions of individual respondents.
A weakness in CHARLS is that its baseline survey
did not include residents of nursing homes. This is
unlikely to cause a major problem, however, because
the fraction of nursing-home residents is very small in
China. In the future, as respondents move to nursing
homes, they will be tracked and remain in our
sample. Another limitation is that CHARLS samples
persons 45 years of age and older, so that it does not
prospectively
capture
complete
histories
of
their
health and behavior, which may have ramifications
for their health status measured today. Another cur-
rent limitation is that the CHARLS blood sample has
not yet been genotyped. We are actively seeking fund-
ing for this and will make the resulting genetic data
available to the international research community.
To deal with nonresponse bias, we created separate
weights for households, individuals, and biomarkers
that correct for nonresponse and sampling-frame
errors in each step of CHARLS. Additionally, during
the first follow-up survey of 2013 we will send enu-
merators back to the households who did not respond
in the national baseline survey of 2011–12 to improve
the baseline response rate. The availability of elec-
tronic maps and pictures at the study facilities will
make it easier to locate the physical address of non-
responding households. We will screen for original
residents
at
the
time
of
the
CHARLS
baseline
survey, and will try to follow those who have left a
household.
Can I obtain the CHARLS data?
All data collected in CHARLS are maintained at the
National School of Development of Peking University,
Beijing, China. Following the completion of data
cleansing, construction of weights, and creation of a
users guide and codebook for the study data, which is
estimated to occur by January 2013, all of the data
will be accessible to researchers around the world at
the CHARLS project website (http://charls.ccer.edu.cn/
charls/). The 2008 pilot survey data have been avail-
able since April 2009, and more than 2000 users,
including about one third from outside of China,
have downloaded data from the pilot survey. The
data are described in detail at http://charls.ccer.edu.

KEY MESSAGES

Underdiagnosis of hypertension is a major problem in China. Among persons 45 years of age and
older, only 66% of men and 64% of women are correctly diagnosed as having hypertension. Of those
in whom hypertension is diagnosed, about 80% take some medication for the condition.

Chinese elderly persons manifest the problems of over- and undernutrition, with 33% of women and
27% of men over the age of 60 years being overweight. Among respondents to the 2011–2012
CHARLS survey, 65% of those older than 70 years of age have low blood concentrations of
haemoglobin.

The overwhelming majority of Chinese 45 years of age and older have some health insurance, but less
than half the cost of medical care is reimbursed, with this being more the case for inpatient than for
outpatient care.

There are major sex differences in cognition that favor men and increase with age. Differences in
education are the major cause of this. As disparities in education disappear among younger adults, so
do cognitive differences
