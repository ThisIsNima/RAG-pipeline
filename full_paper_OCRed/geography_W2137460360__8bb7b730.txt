ABSTRACT
Community-based research in public health focuses on social, structural, and
physicalenvironmentalinequitiesthroughactiveinvolvementofcommunitymem-
bers, organizational representatives, and researchers in all aspects of the research
process. Partners contribute their expertise to enhance understanding of a given
phenomenon and to integrate the knowledge gained with action to beneﬁt the
community involved.
This review provides a synthesis of key principles of
community-based research, examines its place within the context of different
scientiﬁc paradigms, discusses rationales for its use, and explores major chal-
lenges and facilitating factors and their implications for conducting effective
community-based research aimed at improving the public’s health.
INTRODUCTION
Historically, the ﬁeld of public health has examined environmental and so-
cial determinants of health status (54, 95, 132, 165, 174, 179, 182, 186) and in-
volved the public itself in identifying and addressing public health problems
(89, 127, 165). More recently, research aimed at creating knowledge about
health and disease has been emphasized, often using the randomized clini-
cal trial as the “gold standard.” This research has tended to stress individual

rather than social or environmental risk factors, and to separate researchers
and public health practitioners from the public at-large as the health “experts”
(55, 84, 95, 115, 132, 173, 174). The emphasis on individual-level risk factors
tends to obscure the contributions of social and environmental conditions to
health and disease, most visible in the growing gap between the health status of
rich and poor, white and non-white (95, 96, 195). Furthermore, although such
research has contributed to increased knowledge about public health issues and
improved health status, there is often a gulf between that knowledge and its
application (21, 145).
Recognition of the inequities in health status associated with, for example,
poverty, inadequate housing, lack of employment opportunities, racism, and
powerlessness (83, 85, 90, 95, 96, 195), has led to calls for a renewed focus on an
ecologicalapproachthatrecognizesthatindividualsareembeddedwithinsocial,
political, and economic systems that shape behaviors and access to resources
necessary to maintain health (13, 58, 95, 96, 100, 115, 169, 171, 174, 175, 195,
197). Researchers and practitioners alike have called for increased attention to
the complex issues that compromise the health of people living in marginal-
ized communities (87, 195); for more integration of research and practice
(21, 145); for greater community involvement and control, for example, through
partnerships among academic, health practice, and community organizations
(36, 48, 61, 71, 83–85, 103, 121, 125, 197); for increased sensitivity to and com-
petence in working within diverse cultures (9, 112, 113, 118, 160, 161, 185); for
expanded use of both qualitative and quantitative research methods (61, 84,
107, 132, 164, 173), and for more focus on health and quality of life (3, 30), in-
cluding the social, economic, and political dimensions of health and well-being.
These calls for a more comprehensive and integrated approach to research and
practice in public health have been voiced in major national reports [e.g. The
Future of Public Health (145), Healthy People 2000 (72) and Health Profes-
sions Education for the Future: Schools in Service to the Nation (135)]. They
have also been translated into funding initiatives and policy statements by a
number of private foundations and federal and international organizations.1
1Examples include: the W.K. Kellogg Foundation’s Community-Based Public Health Initiative
(194); the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation’s Community Health Promotion Grant Program
(59, 178); the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s America’s Promise; the Pew Charitable Trusts’
support of Community-Campus Partnerships for Health (25); the Center for Disease Control and
Prevention’s Urban Center(s) for Applied Research in Public Health Initiative (19); the National
Cancer Institute’s Plan for Cancer Prevention and Control Research among American Indians and
Alaska Natives (124); the U.S. Ofﬁce of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion’s Healthy Com-
munities Initiative (50); and the World Health Organization’s Healthy Cities Initiative (30, 199).
In addition, the Royal Society of Canada recently commissioned a study to examine the status of,
and to make policy recommendations to further develop participatory research in health promotion
in Canada (61).

COMMUNITY-BASED RESEARCH PARTNERSHIPS
175
This combination of critical reﬂection within public health and new oppor-
tunities for funding has given rise to a number of partnership approaches to
research and practice, variously called “community-based/involved /collabora-
tive/centered-research”(7, 16, 23, 24, 30, 36, 38, 42, 44, 81, 121, 125, 155, 156).
At the same time, a large literature spanning the social sciences has examined
approaches to research in which participants are actively involved in all aspects
of the research process. Examples include “participatory research” (31, 61,
68, 110, 128, 167, 168, 176), “participatory action research” (43, 193), “action
research” (15, 29, 79, 104, 133, 172), “action science/inquiry” (5), “cooperative
inquiry” (141, 143), “feminist research” (110, 119), “participatory evaluation”
(190), and “empowerment evaluation” (47). Despite differences among these
approaches (e.g. 143, 167, 168), each is explicitly committed to conducting
research that will beneﬁt the participants either through direct intervention or
by using the results to inform action for change.
The renewed interest in the “rhetorics and realities” of community-based ap-
proachestopublichealthinthepastfewyears(105)hashighlightedcommunity-
based research as one of many viable approaches to the development of knowl-
edge and action in the ﬁeld of public health. This article examines lessons to
be learned from the interdisciplinary pool of knowledge about conducting col-
laborative or participatory forms of research, and from the experience of public
health researchers, practitioners, and community members working in what is
referred to here as community-based research in public health. Rather than at-
tempt an exhaustive review of the literature mentioned above (e.g. 56, 61, 110,
142, 144, 199), this article draws on the literature on community-based and
related forms of research, the authors’ experiences with community-based re-
search, and related literature on community-based interventions, coalitions, and
community organizing (e.g. 30, 57, 121, 170, 188, 189) with the aim as follows:
to synthesize key principles or characteristics of community-based research; to
examine community-based research within the context of different scientiﬁc
paradigms; to discuss rationales for its use; and to explore challenges and facil-
itating factors and their implications for conducting effective community-based
research aimed at improving the public’s health.
MULTIPLE WAYS OF KNOWING: ALTERNATIVE
INQUIRY PARADIGMS
The past several decades have seen considerable discussion of the construction
of scientiﬁc knowledge. Debates have centered around different paradigms—
basic sets of beliefs about the nature of reality and what can be known about it,
the relationship between the knower and what is known or knowable, and how
the knower can ﬁnd out what can be known (63–65, 97, 110, 141, 144). Within

ISRAEL ET AL
the ﬁeld of public health the positivist paradigm, which emphasizes a static,
objective knowledge that is separate from the knower, has been dominant. From
the positivist perspective, a single reality exists independent from the inquirer’s
interest, operating according to a set of laws that take a cause-effect form. The
inquirer is able to remain distant and value-free from what is being studied,
and methods must be used that control for context (confounding variables)
and allow for predicting phenomenon (64). This paradigm has inﬂuenced the
development of research processes that elevate the presumed objectivity of
scientiﬁc knowledge over subjective or experiential knowledge. This emphasis
on objectivity and expertness underlies the separation of research from practice
in the ﬁeld of public health. An extensive literature examines the limitations
of the positivist paradigm, with direct relevance to the present discussion of
community-based research.2
Guba & Lincoln (65) describe three alternative inquiry paradigms, “postposi-
tivism,” “critical theory et al” (a blanket term for several alternative paradigms,
e.g. feminism, participatory inquiry), and “constructivism.” The latter two
paradigms are particularly applicable for community-based research. From the
critical theory et al perspective, a reality exists that is inﬂuenced by social,
political, economic, cultural, ethnic, and gender factors that crystallize over
time; the researcher and the participant are interactively linked; ﬁndings are
mediated by values; and the transactional nature of research necessitates a
dialogue between the investigator and participants in the inquiry (65). From
the constructivist paradigm, there exist multiple, socially constructed realities
that are inﬂuenced by social, cultural, and historical contexts; the inquirer and
participant are connected in such a way that the ﬁndings are inseparable from
their relationship; and the methods used emphasize a continual dialectic of
iteration, analysis, assessment, reiteration, and reanalysis (64).
It is important for researchers and practitioners to be aware of the differ-
ent paradigms and how they guide their work. Although they are most often
presented as dichotomies, suggesting an either/or choice between, for exam-
ple, positivist and constructivist paradigms, House argues that the “choice does
not have to be between a mechanistic science and an intentionalist humanism,
but rather one of conceiving science as the social activity that it is, an activity
that involves considerable judgment, regardless of the methods employed” (77,
p. 19).
Community-based research draws upon constructivist and critical theoretical
perspectivesthataddresssomeofthecriticismsofpositivistscience. Speciﬁcre-
search methods are determined by the purpose of the study, how the information

is to be used, the context and setting, the theoretical perspectives—including
“local” theory, the applicability of measurement tools, and the input of commu-
nity participants (78, 84, 115). Thus, both quantitative and qualitative methods
may be employed to develop an understanding of the phenomenon under study.
COMMUNITY-BASED RESEARCH: OVERVIEW
The term “community-based research” is used in many ways, and other terms
such as “community-wide research,” “community-involved research,” and
“community-centered research” are sometimes used interchangeably. Consis-
tent with constructivist and critical theory paradigms and their emphasis on the
socially created nature of scientiﬁc knowledge, a fundamental characteristic of
community-based research as deﬁned here is the emphasis on the participation
and inﬂuence of nonacademic researchers in the process of creating knowl-
edge. A critical distinction is the extent to which community-based research
emphasizes conducting research in a community as a place or setting—in which
community members are not actively involved—versus conducting research
with a community as a social and cultural entity with the active engagement
and inﬂuence of community members in all aspects of the research process
(71, 155).3
Community-based research in public health is a collaborative approach to
research that equitably involves, for example, community members, organiza-
tional representatives, and researchers in all aspects of the research process. The
partners contribute “unique strengths and shared responsibilities” (61, p. 12)
to enhance understanding of a given phenomenon and the social and cultural
dynamics of the community, and integrate the knowledge gained with action to
improve the health and well-being of community members (36, 41, 71, 155).
The following presents a set of principles or characteristics that seek to cap-
ture the key elements of this approach based on the present state of knowledge in
the ﬁeld. These principles will continue to evolve as further community-based
research is conducted and evaluated. They are presented with the recogni-
tion that the extent to which any research endeavor can achieve any one or a
combination of these principles will vary depending on the context, purpose,
and participants involved in the process. Each principle may be located on a
continuum, with the principle as described here representing a goal to strive to
achieve, for example, equitable participation and shared control over all phases
3The label “community-centered research” (38, 160) is probably more accurate and less am-
biguous in reﬂecting the emphasis on the social and cultural elements and the role of the community
at the center of this approach, but given the widespread use and recognition of the term “community-
based research” it will be used here.

of the research process (26, 35, 61).4 Although presented here as distinct items,
community-based research is an integration of these elements.
KEY PRINCIPLES OF COMMUNITY-BASED
RESEARCH
1. Recognizes community as a unit of identity
The concept of community as
an aspect of collective and individual identity is central to community-based
research. Units of identity, for example, membership in a family, friendship net-
work, or geographic neighborhood, are all socially constructed dimensions of
identity, created and recreated through social interactions (71, 163, 166). Com-
munity is characterized by a sense of identiﬁcation and emotional connection to
other members, common symbol systems, shared values and norms, mutual—
although not necessarily equal—inﬂuence, common interests, and commitment
to meeting shared needs (83, 92, 150, 166). Communities of identity may be
centered on a deﬁned geographic neighborhood or a geographically dispersed
ethnic group with a sense of common identity and shared fate. A city or other
geographic area may not be a community in this sense of the term, but rather
an aggregate of people who do not share a common identity, or may contain
several different and overlapping communities of identity within its boundaries.
Community-based approaches to research attempt to identify and to work with
existing communities of identity, and/or to strengthen a sense of community
through collective engagement (83, 172).
2. Builds on strengths and resources within the community
Community-based
research seeks to identify and build on strengths, resources, and relationships
that exist within communities of identity to address their communal health con-
cerns (116, 117, 120, 166). These may include skills and assets of individuals
(117), networks of relationships characterized by trust, cooperation and mu-
tual commitment (80), and mediating structures within the community such as
churches and other organizations where community members come together
(8)—resources that have recently been referred to as social capital (138; SR
Smith, unpublished manuscript). Community-based research explicitly recog-
nizes and seeks to support or expand social structures and social processes that
contribute to the ability of community members to work together to improve
health.
3. Facilitates collaborative partnerships in all phases of the research
Commu-
nity-based research involves a collaborative partnership in which all parties

research criteria.

COMMUNITY-BASED RESEARCH PARTNERSHIPS
179
participate as equal members and share control over all phases of the research
process, e.g. problem deﬁnition, data collection, interpretation of results, and
application of the results to address community concerns (9, 32, 38, 61, 71, 81,
82, 102, 106, 111, 122, 126, 128, 155, 160, 172). Communities of identity con-
tain many individual and organizational resources, but may also beneﬁt from
skills and resources available from outside of the immediate community of
identity. Thus, community-based research efforts may involve individuals and
groups who are not members of the community of identity. Such partner-
ships may include representatives from health and human service organiza-
tions, academia, community-based organizations, and the community-at-large.
These partnerships focus on issues and concerns identiﬁed by community mem-
bers (10, 32, 56, 61, 71, 106, 134, 160, 172), and create processes that enable all
parties to participate and share inﬂuence in the research.
4. Integrates knowledge and action for mutual beneﬁt of all partners
Commu-
nity-based research seeks to build a broad body of knowledge related to health
and well-being while also integrating that knowledge with community and
social change efforts that address the concerns of the communities involved
(61, 83, 109, 110, 128, 143, 155, 160, 172). Information is gathered to inform
action, and new understandings emerge as participants reﬂect on actions taken.
Community-based research may not always incorporate a direct action com-
ponent, but there is a commitment to the integration of research results with
community change efforts (155) with the intention that all involved partners
will beneﬁt (32, 61, 101, 134, 143, 155).
5. Promotes a co-learning and empowering process that attends to social in-
equalities
Community-based research is a co-learning and empowering pro-
cess that facilitates the reciprocal transfer of knowledge, skills, capacity, and
power (9, 10, 32, 42, 53, 83, 99, 106, 126, 147, 155, 160, 172). For example, re-
searchers learn from the knowledge and “local theories” (40) of community
members, and community members acquire further skills in how to conduct
research. Furthermore, recognizing that socially and economically marginal-
ized communities often have not had the power to name or deﬁne their own
experience, researchers involved with community-based research acknowl-
edge the inequalities between themselves and community participants, and
the ways that inequalities among community members may shape their par-
ticipation and inﬂuence in collective research and action (11, 110, 199). At-
tempts to address these inequalities involve explicit attention to the knowledge
of community members, and an emphasis on sharing information, decision-
making power, resources, and support among members of the partnership
(9, 83, 99, 114, 147, 199).

6. Involves a cyclical and iterative process
Community-based research in-
volves a cyclical, iterative process that includes partnership development and
maintenance, community assessment, problem deﬁnition, development of re-
search methodology, data collection and analysis, interpretation of data, de-
termination of action and policy implications, dissemination of results, action
taking (as appropriate), speciﬁcation of learnings, and establishment of mech-
anisms for sustainability (1, 45, 71, 83, 102, 144, 162, 172, 176).
7. Addresses health from both positive and ecological perspectives
Commu-
nity-based research addresses the concept of health from a positive model
(3, 70, 91) that emphasizes physical, mental, and social well-being (196). It also
emphasizes an ecological model of health (13, 38, 58, 62, 70, 83, 95, 115, 155,
169, 171) that encompasses biomedical, social, economic, cultural, historical,
and political factors as determinants of health and disease.
8. Disseminates ﬁndings and knowledge gained to all partners
Community-
based research seeks to disseminate ﬁndings and knowledge gained to all part-
ners involved, in language that is understandable and respectful, and “where
ownership of knowledge is acknowledged” (10, p. 186; 36, 56, 69, 106, 110,
155, 161, 191). The ongoing feedback of data and use of results to inform
action are integral to this approach (45, 51, 82). This dissemination principle
also includes researchers consulting with participants prior to submission of any
materials for publication, acknowledging the contributions of participants and,
as appropriate, developing co-authored publications (155).
RATIONALE FOR COMMUNITY-BASED RESEARCH
Many advantages to community-based research noted in the literature are as-
sociated with the changing trends and critiques of public health research and
practicepresentedearlier, aswellascritiquesofthepositivistresearchparadigm.
Some key rationales discussed in the literature on community-based research
include that it:
Enhances the relevance, usefulness, and use of the research data by all
partners involved (14, 28, 151, 156);
Joins together partners with diverse skills, knowledge, expertise and sensi-
tivities to address complex problems (17, 69, 74, 79, 151);
Improves the quality and validity of research by engaging local knowl-
edge and local theory based on the lived experience of the people involved
(1, 10, 32, 36, 40, 56, 69, 110, 151, 185);

Recognizes the limitations of the concept of a “value-free” science (34) and
encourages a self-reﬂexive, engaged and self-critical role of the researcher(s)
variously referred to as “critical subjectivity” (144) and “informed subjec-
tivity” (200);
Acknowledges that “knowledge is power” and thus the knowledge gained
can be used by all partners involved to direct resources and inﬂuence policies
that will beneﬁt the community (32, 36, 69, 74, 110, 176);
Strengthens the research and program development capacity of the partners
(1, 61, 151, 155, 160, 161);
Creates theory that is grounded in social experience, and creates better in-
formed/more effective practice that is guided by such theories (1, 152);
Increases the possibility of overcoming the understandable distrust of re-
search on the part of communities that have historically been the “subjects”
of such research (71, 156);
Has the potential to “bridge the cultural gaps that may exist” (14, p. 211)
between the partners involved (9, 10, 71, 156, 185);
Overcomes the fragmentation and separation of the individual from his/her
culture and context that is often evident in more narrowly-deﬁned, categor-
ical approaches (61, 83, 144, 171);
Provides additional funds and possible employment opportunities for com-
munity partners (1, 126, 156);
Aimstoimprovethehealthandwell-beingofthecommunitiesinvolved, both
directly through examining and addressing identiﬁed needs (37, 61, 71, 155),
andindirectlythroughincreasingpowerandcontrolovertheresearchprocess
(32, 80, 83, 187); and
Involves communities that have been marginalized on the basis of, for ex-
ample, race, ethnicity, class, gender, and sexual orientation in examining
the impact of marginalization and attempting to reduce and eliminate it
(32, 56, 71, 95, 110, 185, 195).
As Hatch and his colleagues (71) summarize in their examination of commu-
nity research partnerships within African-American communities: “the oppor-
tunity arises for communities and science to work in tandem to ensure a more
balanced set of political, social, economic, and cultural priorities, which satisfy
the demands of both scientiﬁc research and communities at higher risk” (71,
p. 31).

CHALLENGES AND FACILITATING FACTORS IN
CONDUCTING COMMUNITY-BASED RESEARCH:
LESSONS LEARNED AND IMPLICATIONS
This section provides a more speciﬁc look at the factors involved in, and lessons
learned from, the actual conduct of community-based research. Most of the
materials considered are speciﬁc examples of research conducted using a col-
laborative approach. Examples from related literatures are included, such as
participatory action research and cooperative inquiry, because of their similarity
to and usefulness in synthesizing issues related to community-based research.
The research reviewed involves diverse communities addressing multiple is-
sues, for example, the prevention of cardiovascular disease within an African-
American community in Baltimore (102); occupational stress within an auto-
mobile plant in south-central Michigan (81, 158); immunization and primary
health care in New York City (149); enhancing community capacity in a ru-
ral Mississippi Delta community (42); Healthy Start initiative in Boston (137);
community empowerment in a multicultural community in Oakland, California
(7); prevention of substance abuse in the Jicarilla Apache Tribe in north-central
New Mexico (45); and maternal and child health within an African-American
community in Detroit (129, 155, 156).
In these examples, the authors frequently discuss challenges, tensions, and
barriers, as well as facilitating factors and lessons learned. In many instances,
the opposite side of a “challenge” is framed as a “facilitating factor.” For ex-
ample, a history of prior positive working relationships may be considered a
facilitator and the absence of such history an impediment. In addition, what
some authors discuss in terms of factors that facilitate collaborative research,
others suggest as strategies for overcoming challenges or barriers. For example,
the joint development of operating norms that foster open communication, mu-
tual respect, and shared decision-making, may be viewed as facilitating factors
in their own right, or as recommendations or “lessons learned” in overcoming
lack of trust and inequitable power relationships.
For coherence, this discussion is organized into three broad, but not necessar-
ily mutually exclusive categories: (a) issues related to developing community
research partnerships; (b) methodological issues involved in community-based
research; and (c) broader social, political, economic, institutional, and cultural
issues. Within each category, key challenges are examined, followed by a dis-
cussion of facilitating factors, lessons learned, and recommendations to address
the related challenges. The salience of various challenges and facilitating fac-
tors will vary at different phases of the community-based research process (e.g.
partnership formation, data collection, data interpretation).

Partnership-Related Issues
CHALLENGES/BARRIERS/TENSIONS
A number of challenges, tensions, and bar-
riers discussed in the literature are speciﬁcally related to the development and
maintenance of partnerships between community members and researchers.
Although interrelated, they are disentangled and presented as separate issues in
this section.
Lack of trust and respect
The most frequently mentioned challenge to con-
ducting effective community-based research is lack of trust and perceived lack
of respect, particularly between researchers and community members. A long
history of research from which there was no direct beneﬁt (and sometimes ac-
tual harm) and no feedback of results to the community has contributed to this
mistrust (35, 71, 102, 106, 114, 146, 156), which sometimes develops into anger
and suspicion (140; SR Smith, unpublished manuscript). Community members
may hesitate to get involved even if researchers are proposing a community-
basedapproach. Onceestablished, trustcannotbetakenforgranted; researchers
must continually prove their trustworthiness (181).
Inequitable distribution of power and control
The history and presence of
power differentials among researchers, health professionals, and community
members is another frequently mentioned challenge. Community members are
legitimately skeptical about whether the language of being “equal partners” can
become a reality of shared ownership and control (1, 7, 16, 27, 35, 82, 114, 137).
Within any community-based research partnership, the distribution of informa-
tion, time, formal education, and income reﬂects broader social inequalities
structured around race/ethnicity, class, and gender (7). These inequalities af-
fect who attends, who participates, whose opinions are considered to be valid,
and who has inﬂuence over decisions made (16, 99). They may be exacer-
bated when meetings are facilitated/led by researchers or health professionals
(27, 82). In addition, community groups who have worked with government
agencies and universities are likely to be familiar with the hierarchical modes
of decision-making in those organizations, and to have few experiences of
such organizations having the knowledge, skills, and willingness to share con-
trol (16, 137). Furthermore, researchers working within those institutions may
encounter unanticipated institutional barriers to their ability to share control.
Finally, questions about the feasibility and beneﬁt of shared control on “all”
aspects of the research process are also relevant. For example, is it most appro-
priate to train community members and health practitioners to analyze data, or
is it more valuable to focus the use of scarce time and resources on involving
them in interpreting and making sense of the data (82)?

Conﬂicts associated with differences in perspective, priorities, assumptions,
values, beliefs, and language
Conﬂicts within a community-based research
partnership may occur between members within the same organization (e.g.
community-based organization, university) as well as across organizational
afﬁliation. They may be associated with differences in overall philosophy,
decision-making styles, values, priorities, assumptions, beliefs, and use of lan-
guage (16, 82, 139, 155). For example, words such as “ownership of data” and
“community-basedresearch”mayhavedifferentmeaningstodifferentmembers
of a partnership, and these different understandings can create conﬂicts (155).
These differences may also be associated with diversity in gender, race, eth-
nicity, class, age, and sexual orientation (82, 110, 114, 155, 161). For example,
conﬂict may arise when women are involved as equal partners in traditionally
male-dominated settings (26, 82), and when one partner makes comments that
are considered sexist or homophobic by other partners.
Conﬂicts over funding
Frequently conﬂict arises over funding.
Common
questions include: Who is the ﬁduciary of the funds, how are funds distributed,
what is the amount of funds provided to different partners, how are budget-
related decisions made, and what happens when funders reduce initial budgets
(16, 137)? When universities or health departments are the ﬁduciary agents,
their structured ﬁnancial systems can make the transfer and reimbursement of
funds to community partners into a cumbersome, time-consuming, and seem-
ingly disrespectful process (16, 137).
Conﬂicts associated with different emphases on task and process
The different
emphases placed by members of a community-based research partnership on
process “versus” task are another potential source of conﬂict. In some research
examples academics have been viewed as more interested in accomplishing
the tasks of the project, whereas the community members were seen as more
concerned with the processes involved, such as how decisions were made and
how relationships were established (16). In other examples, the researcher
was viewed as placing greater emphasis on process goals and being sure that
everyone’s voice was heard, whereas community members wanted to move
ahead more quickly with the tasks (129, 137). Rarely is this a matter of focusing
on either process or task, rather it is the difference in emphasis among partners
that often creates conﬂicts.
Time-consuming process
Numerous issues relate to the time involved in con-
ducting community-based research, particularly the time required to establish
and maintain trusting relationships (71, 82, 110, 122, 155, 190). This expendi-
ture of time often goes beyond what is usually perceived as directly related to

COMMUNITY-BASED RESEARCH PARTNERSHIPS
185
the task/purpose of the research, for example, providing transportation, tech-
nical assistance, and participating in community events (110, 192). This issue
is especially problematic if researchers view community-based research as just
another project and are not committed to developing the necessary long-term
relationships (16).
Who represents the community and how is community deﬁned
Challenges
and conﬂicts also arise related to how the community is deﬁned. Issues may
include: the extent to which a sense of community exists; who represents
the community; the extent to which community participants are members of
community-based organizations and/or more grass-roots groups and how they
relate back to those organizations; who in the community is excluded; the extent
to which participants from community-based organizations represent and reﬂect
community members; and competition or turf issues between community-based
organizations and community groups (7, 60, 82, 106, 129, 130, 137, 156).
FACILITATING FACTORS, LESSONS LEARNED, AND RECOMMENDATIONS: PARTNER-
SHIP ISSUES
Various facilitating factors and strategies have been used in com-
munity-based research efforts to address the challenges and barriers raised
above. They are presented here as lessons learned or recommendations for es-
tablishing and maintaining effective community-based research partnerships.
Here again, although discussed as separate entities, they are interrelated.
Jointly developed operating norms
One of the most frequently mentioned fa-
cilitating factors (although labeled in different ways) is the development by the
partnership of operating norms and procedures that are consistent with and rein-
force the key elements of community-based research (6, 7, 16, 17, 40, 66, 74, 82,
99, 102, 129, 155, 156, 172, 181). Authors have noted the importance of op-
erating in ways that foster attentive listening, openness, caring, inclusive-
ness, agreement to disagree, identifying and addressing conﬂicts, opportunity
for all to participate, negotiation, compromise, mutual respect, and equality
(7, 16, 66, 114, 137, 155, 156, 158, 172, 181). Emphasis needs to be placed on
developingnormsandwaysofoperatingthatpromoteunderstandinganddemon-
strate sensitivity and competence in working with diverse cultures, e.g. with
respect to class, gender, race, ethnicity, age, and sexual orientation (9, 10,
32, 36, 71, 86, 102, 106, 112, 113, 114, 155, 172, 185). For example, establish-
ing norms that encourage respect for group differences and developing mech-
anisms for constructively challenging group processes that reinforce social
inequalities.
Also noted as important is the establishment of a norm of conﬁdential-
ity among participants, in which topics discussed are not shared outside the

partnership (158). Deciding how decisions will be made, whether by consen-
sus or majority vote (81, 106), and with regard to which issues, for example,
budgeting and resource allocation (6), is another important consideration.5
The process of establishing such operating norms should follow the norms
themselves. That is, they cannot be imposed on a partnership, but must be
developed and agreed upon by its members. The extent to which these are
formal or informal arrangements should also be decided by each partnership.
[See, for example, the Memo of Agreement clarifying what is meant by equal
partnership, described by Plough & Olafson (137).]
Identiﬁcation of common goals and objectives
The partnership as an entity
needs to identify a common set of goals and objectives (17, 20, 27, 45, 99, 129),
recognizing that each involved organization has its own mission, goals, and
objectives. Here again, the extent to which these are informal or formal written
arrangements should be decided by the group itself.
Democratic leadership
The success of a collaborative partnership is deter-
mined in part by the extent to which the designated leader(s) fosters democratic
processes and decision-making (2, 17, 98, 157, 158). Thus, effective leaders are
supportive of and facilitate the implementation of the operating norms discussed
above.
Presence of community organizer
Critical to the success of the partnership is
the presence on the staff of a community-based research effort (particularly one
involving an intervention component) of a community organizer who is able
to bring together people in the community, who has a history of community
involvement, and who is respected and perceived as a leader in the community
(122, 156).
Involvement of support staff/team
Support staff, who may or may not be
university-based, frequently provide the glue to keep the research partnership
together.
Responsibilities may include informal communication outside of
meetings, providing minutes of meetings, gaining input on agenda items, cir-
culating materials, establishing computer linkages, distributing grant-related
and other information, and brieﬁng participants who are unable to attend meet-
ings (7, 27, 45, 192).
Researcher role, skills, and competencies
The effective community-based
researcher is often referred to in the literature as a catalyst, facilitator, co-
learner, and/or consultant (52, 82, 161, 172). Researchers contribute their own
expertise—while at the same time recognizing the expertise of others—with
5Many of these factors are consistent with the research on effective group process and the reader
is referred to that literature for further elaboration, e.g., 8, 73, 159.

COMMUNITY-BASED RESEARCH PARTNERSHIPS
187
the aim of establishing interdependency among rather than dependency on any
of the partners involved (7, 33, 56, 74). To further establish trust and show
commitment, researchers need to spend time in the community on an ongoing
basis (49, 140), and at the request of partners, be willing to provide technical
assistance that may not be directly related to the speciﬁc research effort, e.g.
grant writing or questionnaire design for another study. To carry out this role, a
community-based researcher needs skills and competencies in addition to those
required in research design and methods, for example: listening, communica-
tion (e.g. use of language that is understandable and respectful), group process,
team development, negotiation, conﬂict resolution, understanding and compe-
tency to operate in multicultural contexts, ability to be self-reﬂective and admit
mistakes, capacity to operate within different power structures, and humility
(7, 33, 38, 39, 63, 82, 109, 140, 155, 156, 162, 192).
Prior history of positive working relationships
Building upon prior positive
working relationships is a viable strategy for conducting community-based
research (129, 130, 155). Thus, identifying participants based on pre-existing
trusting relationships is an important consideration for developing research
partnerships. Such a history may be established through such mechanisms
as previous collaborative research endeavors, consultations, student internship
programs, conferences, and participation in community-wide coalitions.
Identiﬁcation of key community members
Different facilitating factors or
strategies have been suggested for addressing questions related to how commu-
nity is deﬁned and who represents the community. Several authors mentioned
the importance of involving respected community members who have credibil-
ityandvisibility, andwhoarewell-integratedintheircommunity(6, 20, 99, 102).
Obtaining the involvement of members of the “community of identity” in addi-
tion to representatives from community-based organizations (who may or may
not be of the community) is of paramount importance, recognizing that this
involvement may need to occur in ways other than participation on community-
based research boards (129, 130, 137, 156). In-depth interviews and analysis of
community leadership and decision-making experiences have been suggested
as strategies for identifying appropriate community partners (12, 41).
Methodological Issues
CHALLENGES/BARRIERS/TENSIONS: METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
Challenges re-
lated to research methodology are discussed here as distinct challenges, even
though they are related to each other and to challenges related to the partnership
and broader social issues.
Questions of scientiﬁc quality of the research
Community-based research is
continually challenged by questions raised regarding its validity, reliability, and

----- Page 16 (native) -----

ISRAEL ET AL
objectivity for both basic research and evaluation research (35, 45, 71, 82, 101,
102, 155, 156). The predominance of the scientiﬁc method in public health
makes it difﬁcult to convince academic colleagues, potential partners, and fun-
ders of the value and quality of collaborative research (45, 81, 155, 156).
Proving intervention success
The success of a particular intervention in a
community-based research effort may be difﬁcult to prove (94, 122, 129). For
example, such interventions are often conducted in communities with multiple
concurrentinterventions, anditisdifﬁculttoteaseouttheeffectsoftheparticular
intervention being evaluated (129). In addition, problems such as those related
to few units of analysis, sampling, and migration patterns make it difﬁcult to
detect statistically signiﬁcant effects (122).
Inability to fully specify all aspects of research up-front
Given the role of the
partners in a community-based research effort and the dynamic community con-
text in which it is carried out, it is not always possible to fully specify up-front all
aspects of the research design and intervention (when included) (4, 27, 82, 156).
Thus, there is the challenge of selling a process without completely specifying
all the outcomes beforehand, often troubling for researchers, health profession-
als, and community members, as well as funders (see below) (27, 81).
Seeking balance between research and action
Creating a balance between
research and action that is mutually agreed upon by the partners involved
(1, 45, 82, 156, 180) is not a matter of deciding between research versus ac-
tion, but a question of emphasis and timing (82). Community members are
frequently, although not always, more interested in how the data promote com-
munity changes rather than using the data to address basic research questions.
In addition, community members may not agree on the value of collecting as
much data as the researchers might prefer (82, 156, 180).
Time demands
The active involvement of all partners in the research process,
including questionnaire development, survey administration, and feedback and
interpretation of data, exacts a tremendous commitment of time from all par-
ticipants (82, 156, 162). Community members may well have many other obli-
gations and may perceive some of the issues of concern to researchers (e.g.
sample size, generalizability) as less than pressing. Researchers, too, must
prepare timely and comprehensible feedback sessions/reports to the commu-
nity that emphasize action and policy implications, as well as manuscripts for
publication and ﬁnal reports to funders (82, 156, 162). Analysis of data and
preparation of such feedback is a lengthy process that often creates frustrations
among partners who view it as slowing down the process (82).
Interpreting and integrating data from multiple sources
Community-based
research often involves collecting multiple types of data (e.g. community-based

----- Page 17 (native) -----

COMMUNITY-BASED RESEARCH PARTNERSHIPS
189
survey, in-depth interviews, focus group interviews) from multiple sources
(e.g. random sample of community members, key community leaders, agency
representatives), which increases the likelihood of differences in the results
(26, 183). For example, within a given community men and women and youth
may all identify different concerns (26), and community members, commu-
nity leaders, and health professionals may all identify different priority health
concerns (183). Interpretation of these differences and decisions about how to
integrate and prioritize the results are a challenge for community partners and
researchers alike.
FACILITATING FACTORS, LESSONS LEARNED, AND RECOMMENDATIONS: ME-
THODOLOGICAL ISSUES
Methodological ﬂexibility and different criteria
for judging quality
Given the aims and the dynamic context within which
community-based research is conducted, methodological ﬂexibility is essential,
that is, the use of methods that are tailored to the purpose of the research and
the context and interests of the community (32, 35, 36, 61, 69, 71, 112, 126, 156,
160, 172). Several researchers have suggested greater use of qualitative data for
evaluating the context and process of community-based research interventions
(78, 84, 94, 122, 129, 130).
Furthermore, different criteria for judging qual-
ity, as well as different techniques for establishing the trustworthiness of data
have been proposed (63, 101, 107, 126, 131, 146, 158, 176, 192) such as triangu-
lation, involving multiple sources of data, methods, and investigators (78, 101,
107, 158).
Involvement of community members in research activities
The involvement
of community members in the actual conduct of the research enhances the
quality of the process and the results (42, 102, 106, 146, 149, 156). This may
include, for example, involving community members in the development of
research instruments (156), as well as hiring and training community members
as interviewers for a community-based survey (42, 156).
Conduct community assessment/diagnosis
A key factor facilitating the suc-
cessful conduct of community-based research is the ongoing analysis of com-
munity strengths, resources, structure, and dynamics (42, 45, 106, 122, 129,
172). This continual process of getting to know the community enhances the
relevance and appropriateness of all aspects of the research and intervention,
for example, fostering the development of culturally appropriate measurement
tools and the interpretation of the data (41, 42, 106, 129).
Development of jointly agreed upon research principles
One strategy for
addressing some of the methodological challenges is the joint development of
a Memorandum of Understanding or Community-Based Research Principles
(2, 129, 155, 156). Such collaborative agreements can specify the parameters
around issues such as conﬁdentiality and access to the data.

ISRAEL ET AL
Conduct educational forums and training opportunities
Given that comm-
unity-based research is a different approach than many researchers, community
members, and health professionals are accustomed to, the conduct of educa-
tional forums that address both process and methodological issues, as well as
advantages and limitations of this approach, can be useful (35, 126, 155). Sim-
ilarly, more long-term training opportunities are needed (e.g. masters and doc-
toral degree programs), in which the curriculum covers the knowledge and skills
necessary for professionals to be able to conduct community-based research.
Involve partners in the publishing process
The involvement of partners in the
process of writing and publishing has been suggested as a way to obtain more in-
depth discussions, reﬂection and increased understanding of the methodology,
results and overall process of conducting community-based research (82, 180).
Community and practitioner partners can be involved, for example, as co-
authors in a writing team (155–157), as respondents to initial manuscript drafts
(82), or as reactants to preliminary data analysis and interpretations (157).
Create interdisciplinary research teams
Given the methodological complex-
ity and diverse skills needed to conduct community-based research, many au-
thors have suggested the use of interdisciplinary research teams (70, 82, 126,
155, 160). This does not mean bringing multiple disciplines together to individ-
ually and separately contribute their respective expertise. Rather an approach
is taken that integrates across disciplines in which the synergy involved results
in a more creative and innovative approach to conducting research.
Broader Social, Political, Economic, Institutional,
and Cultural Issues
CHALLENGES/BARRIERS/TENSIONS: BROADER ISSUES
Many of the challenges
and tensions inherent in community-based research relate to broader social,
political, economic, institutional, or cultural issues that shape the partnership
and the activities of the members.
Competing institutional demands
There are multiple and competing demands
on the time and resources available across the partner institutions involved in a
community-based research effort (e.g. publishing, grant writing, providing ser-
vices, increasing community capacity). These larger political and institutional
pressures make it difﬁcult for individuals within these organizations to devote
the requisite time and energy for a particular community-based research en-
deavor. For example, individuals from health agencies and community-based
organizations often get involved in research without being relieved of other
responsibilities (74). Also, while agency and university-based partners are able
to consider their involvement as part of their job, for which they are paid and

----- Page 19 (native) -----

COMMUNITY-BASED RESEARCH PARTNERSHIPS
191
receive some rewards, community participants without a formal institutional
base are often volunteering their time (114, 136). Given these different institu-
tional priorities, and particularly within larger, more hierarchical organizations,
it is a challenge for individuals involved in the partnership to keep other staff
informed and engaged as needed, and to maintain the support of senior admin-
istrators (99).
Risks associated with achieving tenure and promotion within academia
Among academics, the most frequently discussed institutional barriers to con-
ductingcommunity-basedresearcharetherisksassociatedwithtryingtoachieve
tenure and promotion (16, 18, 61, 82, 114, 126, 140, 155, 156). Most academic
institutions confer tenure and promote faculty based primarily on the quan-
tity and caliber of their publications in those journals and with publishers
most respected by the academy (which often place greater value on traditional,
quantitative, basic research), and on having obtained outside research funding,
preferably from a federal granting agency. The time involved in relationship
building, jointly developing and implementing the research, collecting and ana-
lyzing qualitative and quantitative data, and feeding back the results often means
that it takes longer before research results are generated and published in peer-
reviewed publications. In addition, the traditional standards upon which the
quality of the research is judged, the emphasis on both scholarship and practical
relevance, andthedifﬁcultiesinobtainingfunding(discussedbelow), contribute
to making this a high-risk approach for achieving tenure (16, 18, 82, 155).
Expectations/demands of funding institutions
Community-based researchers
face many barriers in obtaining funding and in meeting the expectations of
funding institutions. Green and his colleagues (61), in a survey of 29 participa-
tory research studies in health promotion, found that researchers reported more
difﬁculty obtaining funding for this approach compared to more traditional
research efforts. Most granting institutions that fund public health research
have established priorities for studies that examine categorically deﬁned phys-
ical health problems, involving individualistic intervention approaches (if at
all), focusing outcomes on morbidity, mortality, and risk factors, using tra-
ditional research designs in which the expert researcher deﬁnes the problem
and the methods used, and occurring within a speciﬁed and limited time frame
(122, 191). Such funding priorities are different from both the key principles
of community-based research presented here and from the concerns of many
community partners (1). In instances where funders have altered their nor-
mal priorities and have funded community-based research efforts, the same
expectations and parameters that are consistent with a more traditional research
paradigm (e.g. researcher control, health status/illness outcome indicators) of-
ten still apply (137). In addition, most funding sources have deadlines for grant

submissions that do not allow for the time needed to develop trusting working
relationships and collaborative applications (74, 81).
The time frame required for building relationships, conducting a proper com-
munity assessment, and facilitating community change requires sustained com-
mitment of ﬁnancial and personal resources, often longer than what most fun-
ders are willing to support (35, 39, 81, 122). For example, both Eisen (39), in a
study of 19 empowerment initiatives, and Mittelmark and colleagues (122), in
an examination of “exemplar community-based cardiovascular disease health
promotion programs,” found that no less than and sometimes more than one
year was needed to carry out a successful planning and community assess-
ment phase, preparation considered essential to the overall effectiveness of the
initiatives. The long time involved in conducting community-based research
presents challenges not only in working with funding agencies, but also with
the shorter-term expectations typical of health agencies and universities (81).
Political and social dynamics within the community
Political and social dy-
namicswithincommunitysettings, discussedabove, canbeproblematic. Poten-
tial friction can arise over determining who represents the community, competi-
tion among community groups, different values among partners, and language
and cultural diversity. Community partners are well aware of the history of
negative experiences with researchers and agencies, and thus are reluctant to
engage in activities that may be perceived as selling out to a university or govern-
ment agency, for example, or being critical of other community organizations
or groups.
Deterrents to institutional, community, and social change
As discussed ear-
lier, many political, economic, or cultural factors can impede the institutional,
community, and social changes often associated with conducting community-
based research. Examples include inequitable distribution of power and re-
sources, history of discrimination across culturally diverse groups, expert mod-
els of policy decision-making, and the predominance of a positivist scientiﬁc
paradigm.
FACILITATING FACTORS, LESSONS LEARNED, AND RECOMMENDATIONS: BROADER
ISSUES
Broad-based support: top down and bottom up
The successful con-
duct of community-based research is facilitated when both the staff represen-
tatives and the senior leadership/management of the organizations involved are
supportive of the endeavor—in actions and words (1, 4, 81, 158). Such support
from the top is critical, for example, in enabling participants to contribute the
time necessary, in providing rewards for participation, and in helping effect
needed changes identiﬁed by the research. In addition, the extent to which

----- Page 21 (native) -----

COMMUNITY-BASED RESEARCH PARTNERSHIPS
193
organizational representatives are accountable to their organization and have
enough clout within that organization to make decisions also fosters the success
of the research and commitment to change (39, 158).
Provision of ﬁnancial and other incentives
Given the many challenges, strate-
gies are needed to ensure that the beneﬁts of involvement in community-based
research outweigh the costs (17, 148; SR Smith, unpublished manuscript).
Such strategies include ﬁnancial compensation for all participants involved (i.e.
not only the university participants), ﬁnancial remuneration for institutional
commitment and involvement, public events recognizing partner contributions,
newspaper coverage of partnership efforts, provision of technical assistance,
training and educational opportunities as desired, and letters of commendation
sent to organizational leaders and beyond (e.g. health department director and
mayor’s ofﬁce).
Actions promoting policy changes
A number of examples of actions recom-
mended and taken to facilitate policy changes (e.g. university, governmental,
and funding policies) are consistent with and supportive of the conduct of
community-based research (60, 61, 83, 154, 156). Several Schools of Public
Health have been actively involved in trying to affect the policies on tenure,
promotion, and rewards within their respective universities to be more support-
ive of community-based research (153, 154, 184). Several respected journals
have recently devoted theme issues to the topic of partnership approaches to
research and practice: Health Education & Behavior (formerly Health Educa-
tion Quarterly) (188, 189), The American Sociologist (167, 168), and American
Journal of Preventive Medicine (125). Community-based intervention research
efforts have increasingly emphasized inﬂuencing policy, regulatory, and organi-
zational issues beyond the local level to facilitate more comprehensive changes
(60, 61, 156). Several Foundations have implemented funding initiatives that
include initial time and resources for planning and partnership building (1–2
years), accompanied by a commitment to provide more long term funding (4–8
years) (e.g. W.K. Kellogg Foundation, 1992; Robert Wood Johnson Founda-
tion’s America’s Promise). Furthermore, the potential role of foundations in
leveraging governmental funding sources to direct resources to community-
based research efforts has been advocated and tried (126).
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
The past several decades have seen a resurgence of interest in partnership ap-
proaches to research and practice in public health, with an emphasis on com-
munity participation and inﬂuence in research efforts that are beneﬁcial to the

communities involved. Challenges and limitations of this approach, as well as
the factors that facilitate its effective use have been discussed here. Embed-
ded in this discussion are recommendations for addressing partnership-related,
methodological, and broader social, political, economic, institutional, and cul-
tural issues associated with this approach. There are clear implications for
changes to be made at multiple levels (e.g. individual training, institutional
reward structures), within and across the organizations involved (e.g. univer-
sity, government agency, community-based organization, funding institution)
to foster and strengthen community-based research within public health. Green
and his colleagues, in their study of participatory research in health promotion in
Canada, grouped 45 recommendations from participatory researchers involved
in their study into three broad categories, suggesting the need for “legitimiz-
ing the ﬁeld, supporting the ﬁeld through reform of the funding process, and
building the capacity for greater emphasis on participatory action research in
the future” (61, p. 55).
Despite the extensive body of literature on partnership approaches to re-
search, more in-depth, multiple case study evaluations of the context and pro-
cess (as well as outcomes) of community-based research endeavors are needed
(84, 158). The results of such evaluations will provide a better understanding
of the challenges and facilitating factors raised in this article. In order to assess
the effectiveness of a community-based research effort, the key principles or
characteristics presented here, along with some of the facilitating factors, could
be operationalized and used as criteria for examining the extent to which these
dimensions were present in a given project. The guidelines developed by Green
and his colleagues (61) for classifying participatory research projects are also
useful in this regard.
It has not been the intent of this article to suggest that community-based
research is the only or best approach to conducting research in public health.
Rather the aim has been to present the key principles, beneﬁts, and lessons
learnedfromexperienceswithcommunity-basedresearchthatshowthestrength
of this approach. The challenges notwithstanding, community-based research
offers a means to reduce the gap between theory, research, and practice that
has been problematic in the ﬁeld. This approach is particularly aimed toward
working with marginalized communities, whose members experience limited
access to resources and decision-making processes. The emphasis is on inte-
grating the generation of knowledge into strategies to provide community and
social change.
Community-based research in and of itself will not resolve broader social
issues, such as racism and economic inequalities. Differences in beliefs and so-
cial inequalities enter into community-based research relationships, just as they
do in other forms of research. That they are made explicit in community-based

research, and that the research process attempts to grapple with them and their
implications for the construction of knowledge and the development of ef-
fective strategies for change, enhances the potential for community-based re-
searchtoaddresssocialinequalitiesassociatedwithdifferentialsinhealthstatus.
Community-based research is a viable approach for public health researchers
to reafﬁrm their roots in improving public health as a primary value (173). The
long-term commitment and combined efforts and expertise of all the partners
involved can expand and reﬁne community-based research approaches, thus
contributing to the health and well-being of the communities and institutions
involved.
