Food waste in the global food supply chain is reviewed in relation to the prospects for feeding a
population of nine billion by 2050. Different deﬁnitions of food waste with respect to the complex-
ities of food supply chains (FSCs)are discussed. An international literature review found a dearth of
data on food waste and estimates varied widely; those for post-harvest losses of grain in developing
countries might be overestimated. As much of the post-harvest loss data for developing countries
was collected over 30 years ago, current global losses cannot be quantiﬁed. A signiﬁcant gap
exists in the understanding of the food waste implications of the rapid development of ‘BRIC’ econ-
omies. The limited data suggest that losses are much higher at the immediate post-harvest stages in
developing countries and higher for perishable foods across industrialized and developing econom-
ies alike. For afﬂuent economies, post-consumer food waste accounts for the greatest overall losses.
To supplement the fragmentary picture and to gain a forward view, interviews were conducted with
international FSC experts. The analyses highlighted the scale of the problem, the scope for
improved system efﬁciencies and the challenges of affecting behavioural change to reduce
post-consumer waste in afﬂuent populations.

1. INTRODUCTION
Attempts have been made to quantify global food
waste over several decades, motivated partly by the
need to highlight the scale of ‘waste’ in relation to
global malnutrition. Such assessments are reliant on
limited datasets collected across the food supply chain
(FSC) at different times and extrapolated to the larger
picture. The most often quoted estimate is that ‘as
much as half of all food grown is lost or wasted
before and after it reaches the consumer’ (Lundqvist
et al. 2008). Such estimates are difﬁcult to scrutinize
but highlight the need for greater resource efﬁciencies
in the global FSC. This paper presents results from a
driver review of food waste issues, combining infor-
mation on food waste from the international literature
and interviews with supply chain experts.
(a) Deﬁnitions
Although waste is formally deﬁned in different legal
jurisdictions, deﬁnitions relate to particular points of
arising and are often framed in relation to speciﬁc
environmental controls. Food waste occurs at different
points in the FSC, although it is most readily deﬁned
at the retail and consumer stages, where outputs of
the agricultural system are self-evidently ‘food’ for
human consumption. Unlike most other commodity
ﬂows, food is biological material subject to degra-
dation,
and
different
food
stuffs
have
different
nutritional values. There are also moral and economic
dimensions: the extent to which available food crops
are used to meet global human needs directly, or
diverted into feeding livestock, other ‘by-products’
and biofuels or biomaterials production. Below are
three deﬁnitions referred to herein:
(1) Wholesome edible material intended for human
consumption, arising at any point in the FSC
that is instead discarded, lost, degraded or con-
sumed by pests (FAO 1981).
(2) As (1), but including edible material that is inten-
tionally fed to animals or is a by-product of food
processing diverted away from the human food
(Stuart 2009).

of consumed food per capita and the energy value

relevant, although the second can only be supported

if data are available that include nutritional assessment
of animal feed and food processing by-products.
Table 1 summarizes generalized stages in FSCs and
illustrates different forms that ‘food waste’ may take.
Within the literature, food waste post-harvest is
likely to be referred to as ‘food losses’ and ‘spoilage’.
Food loss refers to the decrease in food quantity or
quality, which makes it unﬁt for human consumption
(Grolleaud 2002). At later stages of the FSC, the
term food waste is applied and generally relates to
behavioural issues. Food losses/spoilage, conversely,
relate to systems that require investment in infrastruc-
ture. In this report, we refer to both food losses and
food waste as food waste.
Similarly, both ‘FSC’ and ‘post-harvest systems’ are
used to mean the same thing in the literature, with
‘post-harvest loss’ also often used when describing
agricultural systems and the onward supply of produce
to markets. FSC is more associated with industrialized
countries where post-harvest processing and large
retail sectors are important features. ‘Post-consumer
losses’ include food wasted from activities and oper-
ations at the point at which food is consumed. The
method of measuring the quantity of food post-harvest
is usually by weight, although other units of measure
include caloriﬁc value, quantiﬁcation of greenhouse
gas impacts and lost inputs (e.g. nutrients and
water). Where loss data are available for each step of
a crop and are applied to production estimates, a
cumulative weight loss can be calculated.
2. FOOD WASTE IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN
(a) Introduction
When the Food and Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations (FAO) was established in 1945, it
had reduction of food losses within its mandate. By
1974, the ﬁrst World Food Conference identiﬁed
reduction of post-harvest losses as part of the solution
in addressing world hunger. At this time, an overall
estimate for post-harvest losses of 15 per cent had
been suggested, and it was resolved to bring about a
50 per cent reduction by 1985. Consequently, the
FAO established the Special Action Programme for
the Prevention of Food Losses.
The main focus was initially on reducing losses of
durable grain; by the early 1990s, the scope of work
had been broadened to cover roots and tubers, and
fresh fruits and vegetables (FFVs). Poor adoption
rates for interventions led to the recognition that a
purely technical focus was inadequate for solving pro-
blems within the sector and a more holistic approach
was developed (Grolleaud 2002). There is no account
of

50 per cent reduction in post-harvest losses to be
achieved by 2025.
(b) Global trends that inﬂuence supply
chain losses
Post-harvest losses are partly a function of the technol-
ogy available in a country, as well as the extent to
which markets have developed for agricultural pro-
duce. Three inter-related global drivers provide an
overall structure for characterizing supply chains and
future trends in developing and transitional countries.
— Urbanization and the contraction of the agricultural
sector. The proportion of the world’s population
employed in agriculture has declined in recent dec-
ades and 50 per cent of the world’s population now
lives in urban environments. This proportion is
expected to rise to 70 per cent by 2050 (United
Nations 2008). Rapid urbanization has created
the need for extended FSCs to feed urban popu-
lations. For these to be efﬁcient, countries need
improvements in roads, transportation and market-
ing infrastructure to keep food affordable for lower
income groups. How these extended supply chains
develop has implications for food waste globally,
now and in the future.
— Dietary transition. Growth of household incomes,
particularly in BRIC countries, is associated with
a decline in consumption of starchy food staples
and diversiﬁcation of diet into FFVs, dairy, meat
and ﬁsh. This transition conforms to Bennett’s
Law (Bennett 1941), where the food share of star-
chy staples declines as income increases. The shift
towards
vulnerable,
shorter
shelf-life
items
is
associated with greater food waste and a greater
draw on land and other resources (Lundqvist
et al. 2008). The transition varies by country and
culture, e.g. in India, there is less pressure on
resources
compared
with
China,
where
the
demand for meat is increasing rapidly.
— Increased globalization of trade. International trade
in processed foods accounts for 10 per cent of
total processed food sold (United Nations 2002).
Globalization may open up opportunities for agri-
cultural exports while representing a threat to
development of internal markets through compe-
tition from inexpensive imports of higher quality
than can be produced locally. Linked to trade liber-
alization, multi-national chains have become a
driving force in the rapid growth of supermarkets
in many transitional economies.
Industrialized countries are experiencing other drivers,
the most signiﬁcant being the ageing population proﬁle
and growth in single person households.
To reﬂect these important global drivers, post-
harvest losses are considered along a technological/
economic gradient: ‘developing’, ‘intermediate’ and
‘industrialized’ FSCs. Figure 1 provides an overview
of the development of post-harvest infrastructure
along this gradient, expanded in table 2.
Developing countries: The majority of the rural poor
rely on short FSCs with limited post-harvest infra-
structure and technologies. More extended FSCs
feeding urban populations are likely to involve many
intermediaries
between
growers
and
consumers,
which may limit the potential for growers to receive
higher prices for quality. Farming is mostly small
scale with varying degrees of involvement in local mar-
kets
and

of
subsistence farmers who neither buy nor sell food
staples (Jayne et al. 2006). Interventions within these

systems focus on training and upgrading technical
capacity to reduce losses, increase efﬁciency and
reduce labour intensity of the technologies employed.
However,
attempts
to
reduce
post-harvest
losses
must take account of cultural implications. In years
with food surpluses, the prices received for goods
will be low. One option is to store surplus for lean
years, but there may not be suitable storage facilities.
To rectify this, investment and engineering skills are
needed. There are many instances of relatively simple
technologies providing effective solutions, such as an
FAO project in Afghanistan and elsewhere that pro-
vided simple effective sealed storage drums for grain
farmers,
dramatically
reducing
post-harvest
food
losses (FAO 2008).
Transitional and industrialized post-harvest systems
have a closer integration of producers, suppliers, pro-
cessors, distribution systems and markets ensuring
greater economies of scale, competitiveness and efﬁ-
ciency in the FSC. Supermarkets are the dominant
intermediary between farmers and consumers. Even
in poorer transitional economies, supermarkets are
the main vehicle for delivering diversiﬁed diets: for
the growing middle classes and the urban poor. This
is almost entirely dependent on foreign direct invest-
ment, with high growth rates in Eastern Europe, Asia
and Latin America (Reardon et al. 2007).
The sequence of transformation follows a different
route in each country, particularly in the extent to
which retailers bypass existing markets and traditional
wholesalers to secure produce of the required standard
and volume. There are often strong cross-links with
export quality assurance, the quality standards set by
supermarkets, and the procurement systems. Many
of the issues identiﬁed are no different from supply
chain issues in developed economies:
— payment terms discouraging small growers;
— retailer product quality standards deterring small-
holders from supplying produce to the market;
— high contractual penalties for partial or total non-
delivery of orders by suppliers;
— product take-back clauses in supplier contracts
allowing retailers to return product to suppliers
once a residual shelf-life has been reached;
— often poor demand forecasting and replenishment
systems and a lack of FSC transparency; and
— difﬁculties inherent in transitioning from trading
systems previously driven by spot market prices
towards long-term contracts.
Literature on transitional economies lacks analysis of
the relative resource efﬁciency of alternative models
of retail development, although there are lessons that
might be learnt from industrialized countries. For
instance, in the UK (DEFRA 2007), estimated con-
tractual penalties, product take-back clauses and
poor demand forecasting had a combined inﬂuence
that drove 10 per cent over-production and high
levels of wastage in the UK FSC.

Accounts
of
supermarket
expansion
in
some
countries suggest there are instances of successful adap-
tation to traditional supply chains (Chen et al. 2005),
particularly in regions that have not been so involved
in export-orientated markets. Where central wholesale
markets are used to source fresh produce, retailers
may be reliant on wholesalers to perform the ‘out-
grading’ that in developed countries is likely to occur
on-farm
or
at
front-end
packing
operations.
In
countries with traditional two-tier produce markets
(higher quality export and lower quality domestic mar-
kets), local supermarkets have created a third market for
intermediate to high-quality products. At the same
time, retailers provide upward pressure to improve
product quality and food safety in the domestic market.
Growth in FFV production has been particularly
strong in the Asia-Paciﬁc region (Rolle 2006), although
the replacement of traditional markets with super-
markets
has
been
slower
in
the
fresh
produce
sector, compared with other food sectors. Within the
region, FFV producers can be grouped into small
farmers, groups of farmers, cooperatives, commercial
farmers and foreign entities/multinationals. These pro-
ducers target different markets, and show a gradient
in their production capabilities, access to technologies,
markets information and infrastructure. Production is
dominated by small farmers with limited access to
resources and technology. Growers generally focus on
production activities, showing little interest in post-
harvest and marketing, which are primarily undertaken
by middlemen and traders. Their major markets
include highly disorganized traditional wholesale and
wet markets, though many supply the requirements of
institutions, supermarkets and fast food chains. With
limited access to ﬁnancial resources and low returns
from agricultural production, these farmers do not
invest in new technologies or improve yields through
increasing inputs to production (Mittal 2007).
Development of more industrialized FSCs can also
result in growth in the food processing sector. In
some BRIC countries, public sector investment is
being considered to accelerate this process. In India,
the government is discussing an ‘evergreen revolution’,
which will involve the build-up of food processing units.
While this is a sensitive issue because of concerns about
the industrialized sector taking control over small farm-
ers, the improved infrastructure has helped farmers
branch out into new foods, diversifying their incomes.
Industrialized FSCs: medium-high income countries
often argue that better resource efﬁciency and less
waste are achieved through centrally processing food.
Although more food wastage occurs at the factory,
logic suggests less waste overall is generated as there
is less ‘scratch-cooking’ at home. However, research
on post-consumer food waste suggests that this is not
the case, as consumers still waste signiﬁcant quantities
of food, thus potentially negating the beneﬁts of
centralized food processing.
(c) Estimates of FSC losses
(i) Introduction
The distinction between perishable and non-perish-
able food stuffs is an important consideration in
post-harvest losses and the adequacy of FSC infra-
structure (table 3). The following sections review
post-harvest losses for cereals (non-perishables) and
FFVs (perishables); few sources were found for other
food types.
(ii) Post-harvest loss estimates for non-perishable food crops
Losses in industrialized countries are not included as
loss rates are generally considered to be low (e.g.
barley losses can be as low as 0.07–2.81%; Smil
2004a) and are not considered signiﬁcant under
normal circumstances.
Grain losses occur in post-harvest systems owing to
physical losses (spillage, consumed by pests) or loss in
quality. Few datasets were found relating to loss of
grain quality, owing to difﬁculty in measurement. As
most of the global production of maize, wheat, rice,
sorghum and millet must be held in storage for periods
from one month to more than a year, many studies
focus largely on storage losses.
Data available for rice post-harvest losses, based on
ﬁeld surveys and used here as an example, are quite
extensive (table 4) and represent the ‘best case’ com-
pared with data for other crops. More extensive
studies suggest that about 15 per cent of grain may
be lost in the post-harvest system (Liang et al. 1993),

with higher storage losses associated with the 80 per
cent of China’s grain stored by peasants inside their
houses
or
in
poorly
constructed
granaries.
The
extent to which variations in data presented in
table 4 might relate to different levels of post-harvest
technology is unclear. For instance, data discussed
by Grolleaud’s review (2002) found the heaviest
losses at the milling stage, perhaps attributable to
case studies from more mechanized systems than
Liang’s data, where storage losses were predominant.
This emphasizes the need for post-harvest loss data
to be regularly updated and more fully described,
particularly for transitioning economies.
Climatic conditions are also an important consider-
ation in determining the wider applicability of data. In
humid climates, rice losses are generally greater at the
drying stage (Grolleaud 2002). Hodges (undated)
reviewed grain losses in East and South Africa,
attempting to compare loss rates in hot humid climates
(where open storage structures were required to main-
tain airﬂow) and hot dry climates (favouring sealed
storage designs). Hodges concluded that data on sto-
rage
losses
were
too
limited
to
permit
reliable
comparisons of loss rates under different climates. In
common with other authors, Tyler (1982) suggested
that the aggregated data reﬂecting losses on a world-
wide basis are of little value. Long-term studies of
post-harvest losses in Zambia and India were identiﬁed
as using ‘reliable methodology’ and indicative of the
fact that when post-harvest losses are determined by
ﬁeld survey, storage and related post-harvest losses
are usually lower than previously reported (table 5;
Tyler 1982).
In summary, the main factors contributing to over-
estimation of grain losses were: (i) where extremes are
taken rather than averages: ideally sample size and
standard deviation should be quoted with the loss esti-
mate to avoid this; (ii) removal from store over the
season are not always accounted for and where they
do occur, percentage losses calculated on the basis of
grain remaining in store will be overestimates unless
an inventory is kept; (iii) treating partial damage as a
total loss, when the damaged grain would be used by
farmers for home consumption or animal feed; and
(iv) potential for double-counting losses at different
stages in the post-harvest system.
(iii) Post-harvest losses for perishable crops
The causes and rates of post-harvest losses for perish-
able crops are substantially different from those for
grains. Horticultural products generally suffer higher
loss
rates
within
industrialized
and
developing
countries, although at different points in the FSC
and for different reasons. Table 6 summarizes post-
harvest loss estimates for FFVs for both developing
and industrialized FSCs.
Kader (2005) estimated that approximately one-
third of all FFVs produced worldwide is lost before
it reaches consumers. Losses in the USA are estimated
from 2 to 23 per cent, depending on the commodity,
with an overall average of 12 per cent. A tentative esti-
mate from the UK suggests losses of 9 per cent
(Garnett 2006), but this disregards produce that
might be left in the ﬁeld after failing to meet cosmetic
or quality criteria. Although not necessarily a post-har-
vest loss, out-grading represents a signiﬁcant aspect of
waste that is difﬁcult to quantify and largely anecdotal
(Stuart 2009), with some produce likely to enter the
food processing sector if it does not meet the criteria.
In the EU, quality and size classiﬁcations for market-
ing FFVs have excluded non-conforming produce
from the market. Recent moves have relaxed these
rules to allow the sale of such FFVs where they are
labelled appropriately (EC 2008).
The general difference between developed and
developing countries is that FFV infrastructure losses
are greater in developing than in developed countries.

As with grain, more data on post-harvest losses are
required to better understand the current situation,
and uncertainties around how post-harvest loss data
are extrapolated are broadly similar.
As with grain, there is evidence of overestimation of
perishable crop losses from traditional subsistence
systems. Within such agriculture, the chain from
ﬁeld-to-consumer is usually short, both in time and
distance.
Traditional
harvesting
techniques,
e.g.
using sticks to harvest papaya and mango, may
bruise fruit, with loss implications for more extended
supply chains. However, a high proportion of FFVs
are consumed because every quality ﬁnds a ready
consumer within the locality.
Where FFVs are marketed, there is potential for FSCs
to be ill-adapted to the changing circumstances. Post-
harvest loss literature cites measures to reduce these
losses, including gentler handling of produce, better

conditioning, faster transportation and proper storage
(FAO 1981; Rolle 2006). These measures require
improved infrastructure and a heightened interest in
quality of produce by the grower. Choudhury (2006)
highlights high loss rates associated with a lack of packing
houses in India, with FFVs generally packed in the ﬁeld
and some even transported without transit packaging.
Furthermore, 30 per cent of FFV production in India
is wasted through lack of a cold chain (Mittal 2007).
Government-supported cold chain programmes are
operational in countries such as Thailand and Taiwan.
In lower income countries, low-cost energy-efﬁcient
cool
storage
systems
have
been
developed
and
implemented in an effort to minimize FFV storage losses.
(d) Overview of food processing and retail losses:
UK example
This review of post-harvest losses has considered
wastage rates from the perspective of different food
types. For industrialized countries, where waste arising
data are compiled, it is possible to quantify total food
losses across different sectors of the FSC. Figure 2 pro-
vides this proﬁle for the UK, with the post-consumer
element included for comparison.
Food and drink wasteis estimated to be approximately
14 megatonnes (Mt) in the UK, of which 20 per cent is
associated with food processing, distribution and retail.
Household food waste makes the largest single contri-
bution, but reliable estimates of other post-consumer
wastes (hospitality, institutional sources) have yet to be
published. The estimated total waste arisings from the
food and drink manufacturing and processing sector is
5 Mt per annum, where approximately 2.6 Mt is esti-
mated to be food waste; a further 2.2 Mt of by-
products are diverted into animal feed (WRAP 2010).
Waste production surveys have identiﬁed that a large pro-
portion of these arisings originate from meat and poultry,
FFVs and beverage sectors. These wastes largely consist
of by-products and unsold prepared food products.
As an indication of the overall resource efﬁciency of
the sector, a mass balance estimated that nearly 56 Mt
of ingredients are used annually to produce 59 Mt of
food products (C-Tech 2004). More mass balances
conducted at food and drink manufacturing sites
suggested that around 16 per cent of raw materials
were wasted (WRAP 2010).
A small number of large retailers in the UK exercise
market power over the 7000 suppliers within the
sector. To avoid being ‘de-listed’, food manufacturers
will often over-produce in case extra quantities are
required at short notice. For manufacturers of super-
markets’ own brands, packaged surplus production
cannot be sold elsewhere and becomes waste; however,
the sector is adept at reusing the majority of food waste
generated (C-Tech 2004). More detailed supply chain
mapping studies are under way to understand where
the
greatest
opportunities
for
increased
resource
efﬁciency lie (WRAP 2010).
At the retail and distribution stage, the most recent
estimate suggests 366 kt per annum (WRAP 2010).
Amounts of waste produced by food retailers vary
between outlet types. Small grocery stores produce
proportionately more waste than large supermarkets,
as the former tend to be used by consumers for
top-up shopping, which makes demand unpredictable.
3. POST-CONSUMER FOOD WASTE
This section summarizes knowledge of post-consumer
food waste, focusing on household sources and quan-
tities of food wasted. Data from a handful of OECD
countries and economies in transition were reviewed.
We were unable to ﬁnd published studies relating to
post-consumer food waste in the developing world,
where a ‘buy today, eat today’ food culture exists.

households (WRAP 2008, 2009a). Others have used
contemporary archaeological excavations of landﬁll
sites to determine historical levels of food waste
(Jones
2006);
estimated
household
food
waste
indirectly from loss coefﬁcients based upon existing
research (Sibria´n et al. 2006); or estimated wastage
using
statistical
models
relating
population
metabolism and body weight (Hall et al. 2009).
Some studies have measured household food waste
as a percentage of total consumed calories, others as a
percentage of the total weight of consumed food or of
the consumed food items. Some studies have sought
to estimate the environmental impact of food waste,
including the embodied greenhouse gas emissions
(WRAP 2008, 2009a) or water (Lundqvist et al. 2008).
Most of the estimates relying on exogenous food
loss coefﬁcients come from studies dating back to the
1970s. Since then, technological progress resulting in
fast changes in markets, distribution systems and
household storage facilities have rendered these esti-
mates outdated (Kantor 1998; Naska et al. 2001).
Increased consumer choice and a decrease in the pro-
portion of disposable income spent on food have
tended to increase wasteful behaviour. As such, any
study where waste was measured over time as a con-
stant proportion of food consumed is in danger of
being inaccurate (Sibria´n et al. 2006).
In many studies, food scraps fed to domestic animals
and sink disposals were not included, thus yielding
inaccurate estimates for total food waste (Harrison
et al. 1975; Wenlock & Buss 1977; T. Jones 2003,
unpublished
data).
In
some
cases,
the
wastage
owing to feeding to pets reached 30 per cent of the
total food wastage in dietary energy terms (Mercado-
Villavieja 1976; Wenlock et al. 1980; Osner 1982).
(b) Deﬁnition of household food waste
Sources of food and drinks that are consumed within
the
home
include
retail
and
contributions
from
home-grown food and takeaways. Figure 3 indicates
which disposal routes are classiﬁed as household
waste streams. In effect, this excludes signiﬁcant quan-
tities of food and drink eaten ‘on-the-go’, in the
workplace or in catering establishments. Wherever
possible,
the
distinction
is
made
between
three
classiﬁcations of household food waste (ﬁgure 4):
‘avoidable’, ‘possibly avoidable’ and ‘unavoidable’.

(c) How much food is wasted in the home?
(i) UK studies
Pre-Second World War studies (Cathcart & Murray
1939) showed that 1–3% of food was wasted in the
home in Britain. The next major study, by the UK
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in 1976,
investigated the 25 per cent ‘crude energy gap’
between estimates of embodied energy in domestically
grown and imported food (an average of 12.3 MJ
(2940 kcal) of energy to each person per day), and
the
average physiological
requirement
for energy
according to the UK Department of Health and
Social
Security
(9.6–9.8 MJ
(2300–2350 kcal)/
person per day) (Wenlock et al. 1980; Osner 1982).
The resultant survey of 672 households recorded all
the potentially edible food wasted in a week, and
found that, when assessed against the expected usage
of food in the home, wastage accounted on average
for 6.5 per cent of the energy intake in summer and
5.4 per cent in winter (Osner 1982).
More recently, the Waste and Resources Action
Programme (WRAP) has shown that household food
waste
has
reached
unprecedented
levels
in
UK
homes (WRAP 2008, 2009a,b), with 8.3 Mt of food
and drink wasted each year (with a retail value of
£12.2 billion, 2008 prices) and a carbon impact
exceeding 20 Mt of CO2 equivalent emissions. The
amount of food wasted per year in UK households is
25 per cent of that purchased (by weight).
(ii) US studies
A 1998 study by Kantor et al. of food waste in the USA
revealed that 25 per cent of food was wasted. Archae-
ological excavations of US landﬁlls by the University of
Arizona (Grifﬁn et al. 2009) also drew attention to
food waste in the USA and provided quantitative
data on the likely scale.
Jones et al. (T. Jones, A. Bockhorst, B. McKee &
A. Ndiaye 2003, unpublished data) estimated that
American households discarded 211 kg of food waste
per year, not including food to drain, into home com-
posting or feed to pets. The amount of food loss at
the household level was estimated to be 14 per cent
(T. Jones, A. Bockhorst, B. McKee & A. Ndiaye
2003, unpublished data), costing a family of four at
least $589.76 annually (Jones 2004). Jones has esti-
mated that overall food losses in the USA amount to
US$90–100 billion a year, of which households threw
away US$48.3 billion worth of food each year (Jones
2006). Finally,
the
US Environmental
Protection
Agency estimated that food waste in 2008 accounted
for 12.7 per cent (31.79 Mt) of municipal solid waste
stream (USEPA 2009).
(iii) Miscellaneous studies from other countries
Despite the dearth of food waste data in Australia, a
submission to the Senate inquiry estimated that food
waste comprises 15 per cent of the 20 Mt of waste
that goes to landﬁll each year (Morgan 2009).
A South Korean study (Yoon & Lim 2005) fol-
lowed their 2002 landﬁll ban on food waste in the
municipal waste stream and suggested that food
accounted
for
26–27%
of
household
waste
(Baek 2009). Despite an awareness-raising effort in
advance of the ban, food waste increased by almost
6 per cent over 4 years after the ban, with increased
consumption
of FFVs linked to higher
incomes
cited as a reason.
The Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and
Food Quality has estimated that Dutch consumers
throw away approximately 8–11% of food purchased
(2009), equating to 43–60 kg of food waste with an
average value of E270–400 per person per year
(Tho¨nissen 2009).
Finally, a UN FAO study (Pekcan et al. 2006) esti-
mated household food wastage using a sample of 500
households in Ankara, Turkey, grouped according to
socio-economic status. Mean energy intake levels per
consumption unit and per person were 2692.6 and
2207.9 kcal d–1, respectively. The mean daily energy
loss from acquisition of food to plate waste was
481.7 kcal by the average household and 215.7 kcal
per person, amounting to 8.9 per cent of daily per
person dietary energy consumption. The average
daily discards per household and per person were
816.4 and 318.8 g, respectively.
(iv) Comparison of food waste arisings between countries
The few quantitative studies that relate to post-consu-
mer food waste are difﬁcult to compare in terms of
food wastage per household, as demonstrated in
table 7. Different methods and deﬁnitions applied to
the measurement of food waste reduce comparability
of data and some methods do not provide robust esti-
mates owing to small samples. Different deﬁnitions of
food waste are applied, particularly with regard to
‘edible’ and ‘inedible’ fractions and the extent to
which
alternative
disposal
routes
are considered.
When differences are identiﬁed, the post-consumer
element must also be considered in the context of
the whole FSC.
(d) What types of food are being wasted?
Most studies that have sought to identify the main food
types wasted ﬁnd that it is the most perishable food
items that account for the highest proportion of
food waste. FFVs are usually among the most-wasted
items, followed by other perishables like bakery and
dairy products, meat and ﬁsh (Pekcan et al. 2006;
WRAP 2008; Morgan 2009; Tho¨nissen 2009).
There is often a large variation in the wastage rates
for different food types: WRAP (2009a) found that
7 per cent of milk purchases is wasted, 36 per cent
of bakery and over 50 per cent of lettuce/leafy salads
(by
weight),
while
Jones
et
al.
(T.
Jones,
A. Bockhorst, B. McKee & A. Ndiaye 2003, unpub-
lished data) found similar variations in the average
wastage rates for different food types.
Although food and drink categories are not fully
consistent across studies, ﬁgure 5 serves to highlight
variation
in
household

waste
composition.
Tho¨nissen (2009) found an unusually high proportion
of food waste consisted of dairy products, while in the
Turkish data, wasted FFVs accounted for the highest
proportion (Pekcan et al. 2006). The extent to which
such differences relate to consumption patterns or

different wastage rates cannot be divined from these
data alone, although the Turkish study noted the
importance of fruit in the diets of households studied.
Nor do these compositional data distinguish between
avoidable and unavoidable food waste, the exception
being the UK data shown in ﬁgure 6.
(e) Who is wasting all of this food?
The following factors may help to explain variation in
quantities of household food waste generated.
— Household size and composition. Studies from the
UK (Wenlock & Buss 1977; Osner 1982; WRAP
2009a) and the USA (Van Garde & Woodburn
1987) show that food wastage was signiﬁcantly
inﬂuenced by the composition of the family, with
adults wasting more in absolute terms than chil-
dren, and larger households wasting less per
person than smaller households. Single-person
householders tend to throw away more per capita,
and households with children tend to waste more
than households without children, although rates
vary with the children’s age.

— Household income. The majority of studies suggest
that there is lower food loss in low-income than
in high-income households (Osner 1982; Brook
Lyndhurst 2007); some studies (Dowler 1977;
Wenlock et al. 1980; T. Jones 2003, unpublished
data)
found
little
or
no
correlation
between
income and food wastage.
— Household demographics. Studies in the UK (Osner
1982;
Brook
Lyndhurst
2007)
and
Australia
(Hamilton et al. 2005) suggest that young people
waste more than older people, with pensioner
households wasting the least (such households
normally contain comparatively fewer people).
— Household culture. There is some indication that
culture
partly
determines
food
wastage.
For
example, Hispanic households in the USA have
lower food loss rates (approx. 25% less) than
non-Hispanics and Hispanic households consume
more FFVs compared with non-Hispanic house-
holds.
However,
FFV
consumption
among
Hispanic households has decreased over the last
20 years as they consume more prepared foods.
Food waste studies in the UK (Brook Lyndhurst 2007)
and Australia (Hamilton et al. 2005) have sought to
proﬁle segments of the population according to their
attitudes and behaviours with respect to food, drawn
from household survey work and waste compositional
data. Such studies are a useful tool in targeting par-
ticular
elements
of
the
population
with
waste
reduction messages and information.
(f) Why are we wasting all of this food?
There are a limited number of studies focusing speciﬁ-
cally on the reasons for householders wasting food,
largely restricted to the UK (Exodus 2006; Brook
Lyndhurst 2007; WRAP 2008, 2009a,b), the USA
(Van
Garde
&
Woodburn
1987)
and
Australia
(Hamilton et al. 2005).
These studies highlight a complex array of consu-
mer attitudes, values and behaviours towards food
and how varying degrees of food knowledge affect
individual’s propensity to waste food. It is possible to
group identiﬁed attitudes, values and behaviours by
using a combination of qualitative and quantitative
consumer research techniques thereby determining
key claimed behaviours, and waste compositional
analysis. The resultant information is then used to
establish those attitudes, values and behaviours that
are the strongest drivers of household food waste. In
the
UK,
detailed
research
ﬁndings
described
in
ﬁgure 7 for the two principal reasons why avoidable
food waste occurs are: ‘food is not used in time’ and
‘too much food is cooked, prepared or served’.
Bracketed ﬁgures show the tonnages and economic
values for food and drink separately.
These two broad categories are explained below:
— Cooked, prepared or served too much. In the majority
of cases, this is because too much food was ‘pro-
cessed’ in the home, but also covers cases where
food was damaged during processing (e.g. burning
food). This category could be referred to as
‘leftovers’.
— Not used in time. This covers food and drink wasted
because it passed a date label (e.g. a ‘use by’ or
‘best before’ date), has gone mouldy or looked,
smelt or tasted bad.
From the research conducted in the UK (table 8),
Australia and the USA, some conclusions can be
drawn about the main factors that drive food waste
in the home and practical solutions can be shaped
that make it easy for consumers to reduce the
amount of food they waste.
4. FOOD WASTE TO 2050: PROJECTIONS

production of waste differs within the developing,
transitional and developed worlds. Here we discuss
the trends likely to drive waste production in future,
where there could
be
the greatest potential
for
reduction of food waste to occur in developing and
developed worlds, and what policies and systems
may be required to reduce food waste to 2050.
(a) Future trends
In the developing world, lack of infrastructure and
associated technical and managerial skills in food pro-
duction
and
post-harvest
processing
have
been
identiﬁed as key drivers in the creation of food waste,
both now and over the near future (WFP 2009).
This
situation
contrasts
with
that
in
developed
countries where our interviewees forecast the majority
of food waste continuing to be produced post-
consumer, driven by the low price of food relative to
disposable income, consumers’ high expectations of
food cosmetic standards and the increasing disconnec-
tion between consumers and how food is produced.
Similarly, the increasing urbanization within transi-
tioning countries will potentially disconnect those
populations from how food is grown, which is likely
to further increase food waste generation.
Across the globe, resource and commodity limit-
ations, in part as a result of an increasing population
but also owing to impacts of climate change, were
viewed as being likely to increase the economic value
of food, potentially driving more efﬁcient processes
that could lead to food waste reduction. Industrialized
FSCs will continue to develop in response to these
wider challenges by the development of shared logis-
tics (e.g. collaborative warehousing), identiﬁcation
and labelling of products (use of barcodes and RFID
tags)
and
better
demand
forecasting
(Global
Commerce Initiative 2008), and domestic kitchen
technologies (smart fridges, cookers, online meal plan-
ning and recipe resources) may make it easier for
consumers to manage their food better and waste
less of it.
(b) The greatest potential for food waste
reduction
Interviewees emphasized the importance of imple-
menting sustainable solutions across the entire FSC
to fully realize the potential for food waste reduction.
In developing and emerging economies, this would
require market-led large-scale investment in agricul-
tural
infrastructure,
technological
skills
and
knowledge, storage, transport and distribution. Such
investments have been shown to stimulate rural econ-
omies (WFP 2009), e.g. the development of the Nile
Perch Fishery in East Africa. In this case, and despite
the unintended consequences of over-ﬁshing and
disruption of local communities, the international
market for Nile perch stimulated infrastructure devel-
opment and considerably reduced post-harvest losses.
Where international markets and local policies and
investment are lacking, large-scale capital investment
in infrastructure in developing countries has often
failed (FAO 2003; Kader 2005). For long-term
sustainability, development across the FSC in the
developing
world
requires
locally
supported
government policies and investment alongside any
market-led private investment with reach through
into developed world markets. Examples of integrated
cross-FSC approaches to food waste reduction include

various cooperative schemes, e.g. the Common Code
for
Coffee
Community,
and
the
Sustainable
Agriculture Initiative.
Conversely, the greatest potential for the reduction
of food waste in the developed world lies with retailers,
food services and consumers. Cultural shifts in the
ways consumers value food, stimulated via education,
increased awareness of the FSC and food waste’s
impact on the environment have the potential to
reduce waste production. Improved food labelling
and better consumer understanding of labelling and
food storage also have food waste reduction potential.
WRAP’s ongoing activities in this area, through pro-
grammes such as ‘Love Food Hate Waste’, are very
recent and their impact is yet to be established. With
food price recognized as the most important factor in
determining consumer decisions, anecdotal evidence
suggests that the economic crisis has stimulated a
shift in consumer attitude to food waste.
Innovative technology throughout the FSC, in both
developed and developing worlds, particularly in
packaging, contributes to improving shelf life for per-
ishable foods and semi-prepared meals. Continued
developments in packaging, e.g. utilizing nanotechno-
logy and materials science, have the potential to
further increase shelf life.
(c) Policy, systems and practices
In the developing world, transfer of existing technol-
ogies and the spread of good practice, allied to
market-led investment, have the greatest potential to
reduce food waste across the FSC. It is of key impor-
tance, however, that practical developments address
the problems of local farmers, using indigenous knowl-
edge where that has been shown to be sustainable.
Without
participation
of
local
farmers,
such
knowledge transfer is unlikely to succeed.
While attempts to shift consumer behaviour may
result
in
reduction
in
food
waste
in
developed
countries, changes in legislation and business behav-
iour towards more sustainable food production and
consumption will be necessary to reduce waste from
its current high levels. An example might be through
the development of closed-loop supply chain models
(WEF 2010). In such models, waste of all forms
would be fed back into the value chain (such as packa-
ging waste being re-used), food graded as lower quality
for cosmetic reasons and food that is surplus to retailer
or manufacturers, to be made available through
alternative routes (e.g. Fareshare or as cheaper alterna-
tives), while unavoidable food waste would be utilized
as a by-product, e.g. in providing energy from waste
using the appropriate technology.
5. CONCLUSIONS
A ﬁrm evidence base from which to assess food waste
globally is lacking, with no speciﬁc information on the
impact of food waste in BRIC countries a major con-
cern, and with much of the loss estimates from
developing countries collected over 30 years ago.
There is a pressing need for quantitative evidence cov-
ering developing countries and the rapidly evolving
BRIC country FSCs. Without systematic evidence,
the arguments over the potential for reducing global
food waste as a contribution to feeding nine billion
people by 2050 will remain largely rhetorical, and
measuring
progress
against
any
global
reduction
target impossible.
As a consequence of the information gaps and
uncertainties, there is no consensus on the proportion
of global food production that is currently lost. Ranges
between 10 and 40 percent of total global food pro-
duction and as high as 50 per cent are quoted, but
on closer examination, these estimates all link back
to the same limited primary datasets, where much of
the published data relates to ﬁeldwork undertaken in
the 1970s and 1980s. Recent reviewers of these data
claim there is a tendency to over-state losses in relation
to
traditional
agricultural
systems
in
developing
countries, a point reiterated in this review.
The lack of infrastructure in many developing
countries and poor harvesting/growing techniques are
likely to remain major elements in the generation of
food waste. Less than 5 per cent of the funding for
agricultural research is allocated to post-harvest sys-
tems (Kader 2003), and yet reduction of these losses
is recognized as an important component of improved
food security (Nellemann et al. 2009). Irrespective of
global region, there is a need for successful introduc-
tion of culture-speciﬁc innovations and technologies
across the FSC to reduce losses.
Linked to the above, market transformation has
enormous potential to develop FSC infrastructure
and reduce waste in developing and BRIC countries.
Account should be taken of the impact of market
transformation on the local communities to whom
food may no longer be available.
The rapid expansion of FFVs supplied to consu-
mers in transitional countries is highly likely to have
resulted in signiﬁcant post-harvest losses, owing to
inadequate infrastructure. In the industrialized world
meanwhile, post-harvest losses have been squeezed
out of grain supply through heavy technological invest-
ments, while for FFVs, retailers’ and consumers’
demand for ‘cosmetically perfect’ produce has created
signiﬁcant post-harvest losses through ‘out-grades’.
There is also strong evidence of an increase in post-
consumer waste over the past several decades, particu-
larly in the developed world, with pockets of data
supporting similar behaviour in BRIC countries.
The majority of studies show that as the proportion
of
income
spent
on
food
declines,
food
waste
increases. There is clear evidence of a distribution of
waste across demographic groups, with the lowest
wastage rates in the immediate post-war age gener-
ation. However, it would be a mistake to assume that
the demographic distribution will remain the same in
the future, as today’s elderly generally exhibit a
‘waste not want not’ mentality, while the elderly of
the future are likely to continue to retain the same
attitudes and behaviours to food that they have today.
There are clearly fundamental factors affecting
post-consumer food waste worldwide, some of which
may require solutions that involve direct communi-
cation and awareness-raising among consumers of
the importance of reducing food waste. Others require
government
interventions
and
the
support

ing the clarity of food date labelling and advice on food
storage, or ensuring that an appropriate range of pack
or portion sizes is available that meets the needs of
different households.
