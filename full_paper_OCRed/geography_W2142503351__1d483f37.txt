ABSTRACT
Traditional and molecular typing schemes
for the characterization of pathogenic microorganisms are
poorly portable because they index variation that is difficult
to compare among laboratories. To overcome these problems,
we propose multilocus sequence typing (MLST), which ex-
ploits the unambiguous nature and electronic portability of
nucleotide sequence data for the characterization of micro-
organisms. To evaluate MLST, we determined the sequences
of '470-bp fragments from 11 housekeeping genes in a
reference set of 107 isolates of Neisseria meningitidis from
invasive disease and healthy carriers. For each locus, alleles
were assigned arbitrary numbers and dendrograms were
constructed from the pairwise differences in multilocus allelic
profiles by cluster analysis. The strain associations obtained
were consistent with clonal groupings previously determined
by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis. A subset of six gene
fragments was chosen that retained the resolution and con-
gruence achieved by using all 11 loci. Most isolates from
hyper-virulent lineages of serogroups A, B, and C meningo-
cocci were identical for all loci or differed from the majority
type at only a single locus. MLST using six loci therefore
reliably identified the major meningococcal lineages associ-
ated with invasive disease. MLST can be applied to almost all
bacterial species and other haploid organisms, including
those that are difficult to cultivate. The overwhelming advan-
tage of MLST over other molecular typing methods is that
sequence data are truly portable between laboratories, per-
mitting one expanding global database per species to be placed
on a World-Wide Web site, thus enabling exchange of molec-
ular typing data for global epidemiology via the Internet.
The ability to identify accurately the strains of infectious
agents that cause disease is central to epidemiological surveil-
lance and public health decisions, but there are no wholly
satisfactory methods of achieving this goal (1). All of the
numerous methods that are currently used suffer from signif-
icant drawbacks, including various combinations of inadequate
discrimination, limited availability of reagents, poor reproduc-
ibility within and between laboratories, and an inability to
quantitate the genetic relationships between isolates. How-
ever, perhaps the most important limitation of current typing
methods is the difficulty of comparing the results achieved by
different laboratories.
Molecular typing methods are used to address two very
different kinds of problem. First, are the isolates recovered
from a localized outbreak of disease the same or different
strains (short term or local epidemiology)? Second, how are
strains causing disease in one geographic area related to those
isolated world-wide (long term or global epidemiology)? Dif-
ferent methods may be appropriate for investigating local and
global epidemiology, but in both cases they should be highly
discriminatory such that isolates assigned to the same molec-
ular type are likely to be descended from a recent common
ancestor, and isolates that share a more distant common
ancestor are not assigned to the same type.
High levels of discrimination can be achieved in two quite
different ways. In one approach, individual loci, or uncharac-
terized regions of the genome, that are highly variable within
the bacterial population are identified. For bacterial patho-
gens, several methods based on this approach are currently
popular, e.g., ribotyping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis
(PFGE), and PCR with repetitive element primers, or arbi-
trary primers (1). In these methods, restriction enzymes (or
PCR primers) are chosen that give maximal variation within
the population; consequently, the variation that is indexed is
evolving very rapidly, usually for unknown reasons. The sec-
ond approach, typified by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis
(MLEE), is to use variation that is accumulating very slowly in
the population and that is likely to be selectively neutral.
Although only a small number of alleles can be identified
within the population by using this type of variation, high levels
of discrimination are achieved by analyzing many loci.
Methods that index rapidly evolving variation are useful for
short term epidemiology but may be misleading for global
epidemiology. Several studies have shown that techniques such
as PFGE resolve isolates that are indistinguishable by MLEE.
For example, MLEE studies of populations of Salmonella
enterica have shown that isolates of serovar Typhi from typhoid
fever belong to one of two closely related electrophoretic types
(ETs) (2). In contrast, isolates of serovar Typhi are relatively

diverse according to PFGE (3). PFGE is therefore useful for
studying individual outbreaks of typhoid fever because, unlike
MLEE, it identifies the microvariation that is needed to
distinguish between strains circulating within a geographic
area. However, this technique is too discriminatory for long
term epidemiology because it does not indicate that isolates
that cause typhoid fever are members of a single globally
distributed clonal lineage of S. enterica. To use a common
metaphor, PFGE and other similar methods fail to see the
forest for the trees.
The most appropriate of the current techniques for long
term epidemiology, and for the identification of lineages that
have an increased propensity to cause disease, is undoubtedly
MLEE. This approach also has contributed most to our
understanding of the global epidemiology and population
structure of infectious agents. For many pathogens, MLEE
successfully has identified clusters of closely related strains
(clones or clonal complexes) that are particularly liable to
cause disease (1, 4). A major problem with MLEE, and all
other current typing methods, is that the results obtained in
different laboratories are difficult to compare. We have there-
fore chosen to adapt the proven concepts and methods of
MLEE by identifying alleles directly from the nucleotide
sequences of internal fragments of housekeeping genes rather
than by comparing the electrophoretic mobilities of the en-
zymes they encode. This modification has overwhelming ad-
vantages. First, far more variation can be detected, resulting in
many more alleles per locus than are obtained with MLEE.
Second, sequence data can be compared readily between
laboratories, such that a typing method based on the sequences
of gene fragments from a number of different housekeeping
loci [multilocus sequence typing (MLST)] is fully portable and
data stored in a single expanding central multilocus sequence
database can be interrogated electronically via the Internet to
produce a powerful resource for global epidemiology. In this
paper, we report the development and validation of MLST for
the identification of the virulent lineages of the bacterial
pathogen Neisseria meningitidis. The MLST approach is, how-
ever, applicable to almost all pathogenic, or nonpathogenic,
bacterial species and to many other haploid organisms.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial Strains. A total of 107 strains of N. meningitidis
were chosen for analysis from globally representative strain
collections (5–8). The strains included '10 isolates of each of
the 7 recognized hyper-virulent lineages (subgroups I, III, and
IV-1, ET-5 complex, ET-37 complex, A4 cluster, and lineage
3), chosen to represent the diversity of MLEE profiles, dates,
and countries of origin found within each lineage. One strain
was chosen from each of the other serogroup A subgroups, and
30 strains were included to represent the diversity of the other
ETs resolved by MLEE, most of which had been isolated in the
Netherlands (9, 10) and Norway (11). Two strains (NG 3y88,
NGH 41) that had been assigned to the A4 cluster on the basis
of a dendrogram of serogroup B bacteria (8) had not clustered
with the A4 cluster with data from a larger strain collection (5).
They did not cluster with the A4 strains in this analysis and
have been reassigned here as ‘‘other.’’
Nucleotide Sequencing of Gene Fragments. The nucleotide
sequences of internal fragments of the following genes (protein
products are shown in parentheses) were obtained: abcZ
(putative ABC transporter), adk (adenylate kinase), aroE
(shikimate dehydrogenase), gdh (glucose-6-phosphate dehy-
drogenase), mtg (monofunctional peptidoglycan transglycosy-
lase), pdhC (pyruvate dehydrogenase subunit), pgm (phospho-
glucomutase), pilA (regulator of pilin synthesis), pip (proline
imino-peptidase), ppk (polyphosphate kinase), and serC (3-
phosphoserine aminotransferase). The gene fragments were
amplified from chromosomal DNA of the 107 N. meningitidis
strains by using PCR with the following primers: abcZ-P1,

Chromosomal Mapping. Gene fragments were amplified as
above by using the PCR digoxygenin labeling mix (Boehringer
Mannheim) and hybridized to chromosomal DNA from strain
Z2491 (subgroup IV-1), which had been separated by PFGE
after digestion with the rare cutting enzymes SgfI, NheI, SpeI,
BglII, PmeI, or PacI. The bands that hybridized were identified
on the physical map of strain Z2491 (12). The data confirmed
the published map locations of pgm, ppk, and pdhC (12). serC
maps near opaB (13), and abcZ maps near opc (data not
shown), whose map locations also were confirmed. The map
locations of these and the newly mapped gene fragments gdh,
aroE-mtg, pilA, adk, and pip are shown in Fig. 1.
Estimating Relatedness Between Strains. For each gene
fragment, the sequences from the 107 strains were compared,
and isolates with identical sequences were assigned the same
allele number. For each strain, the combination of alleles at
each locus defined its multilocus sequence type (ST). The
relatedness between each ST was shown as a dendrogram,
constructed by the unweighted pair group cluster method with
arithmetic averages [unweighted pair group method with
arithmetic mean (UPGMA)] from the matrix of allelic mis-
matches between the STs.
RESULTS
The Population Structure of N. meningitidis. N. meningitidis,
the meningococcus, is a major bacterial pathogen that causes
epidemics, outbreaks, and isolated cases of meningitis and
septicemia globally. We chose this species to validate MLST
because a set of reference strains was available whose rela-
tionships have been inferred by using MLEE. In addition,

meningococci present a particular challenge to molecular
typing because the extent of recombination in meningococci is
higher than that in most bacterial populations (15).
Populations of bacterial pathogens typically consist of a
large and heterogeneous collection of isolates that rarely cause
disease and a small number of groups of closely related strains
(clones or lineages) that are particularly associated with out-
breaks of disease. We will use the term ‘‘hyper-virulent
lineage’’ to describe strains with an increased capacity to cause
disease. Most invasive meningococcal disease in the developed
world has been associated with a small number of hyper-
virulent lineages of serogroup B or C isolates, referred to by
MLEE designations: ET-5 complex; ET-37 complex; A4 clus-
ter; and lineage 3 (16). In parts of the developing world, and
particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, epidemics or pandemics of
meningococcal disease occur and usually are caused by isolates
of serogroup A. Over the last 30 years, epidemics and pan-
demics of serogroup A meningococcal disease have been
caused by a small number of related hyper-virulent lineages,
termed ‘‘subgroups’’ (16), the most important of which are
subgroups I, III, and IV-1.
Recombination in meningococci is believed to be frequent
compared with mutation (17). Accordingly, hyper-virulent
lineages will emerge at intervals within the population and
slowly diversify as their initially uniform genomes become
increasingly pocked by highly localized recombinational re-
placements. Ultimately, these lineages may diversify to such an
extent that they can no longer be distinguished from the
background meningococcal population. MLEE studies, using
12–19 loci, successfully have identified hyper-virulent lineages
among meningococci as they form clusters (clone complexes)
of closely related ETs on dendrograms constructed from the
electrophoretic data (5–8).
Nucleotide sequencing of multiple housekeeping genes
(possessing the appropriate levels of sequence diversity)
should also assign strains to each of the known hyper-virulent
lineages and distinguish these lineages from each other and
from the large background of other isolates. Accordingly, all
members of each of the currently circulating hyper-virulent
lineages should have identical alleles at all housekeeping
genes. Exceptions will occur where a recombinational replace-
ment (or mutation) has occurred within one of the genes being
sequenced. In contrast, most isolates from the general menin-
gococcal population, e.g., those from the nasopharynges of
healthy carriers, are known to be more diverse than disease
isolates and will often have unique combinations of alleles at
the housekeeping loci. The repeated isolation of meningococci
that have the same alleles at each of the housekeeping loci
identifies a hyper-virulent lineage or clone. The method
therefore has the potential to identify existing and newly
emerging hyper-virulent lineages and to monitor their global
spread.
Sequences of Gene Fragments from 107 Reference Strains
of N. meningitidis. We chose internal regions of 11 housekeep-
ing genes that were sufficiently small to be sequenced accu-
rately using a single primer for each direction (417–579 bp).
The sequences of these 11 gene fragments were determined for
all 107 strains. The number of alleles ranged from 10 to 36, with
26–166 variable bases per gene fragment (Table 1). The genes
were mapped on a physical map (12) to ensure that they were
unlinked (Fig. 1). Of the 11 loci, only mtg and aroE were linked
sufficiently closely that they might be frequently coinherited in
single transformation events.
Congruence Between MLST and MLEE. We refer to a
unique combination of alleles as a sequence type (ST), which
is analogous to the MLEE electrophoretic type (ET). A
dendrogram based on a matrix of pairwise differences between
the allelic profiles for the 11 loci resolved 74 STs among the 107
strains and yielded results corresponding to those from MLEE
(data not shown), with a few exceptions described below.
The congruence between sequence data and MLEE was
much better for some gene fragments than others, for reasons
that will be discussed elsewhere. We therefore chose a subset
of six gene fragments (abcZ, adk, aroE, gdh, pdhC, and pgm)
(Table 1) for which the allele assignments correlated almost
perfectly with that expected from the MLEE data. Because
this approach assumes the validity of the clustering produced
by MLEE, the data also were analyzed for internal consistency
that confirmed that these six loci were the most congruent
(Table 1). The dendrogram constructed by using this subset of

and opaB are located within a few kilobases of each other (13) as are
abcZ and opc (unpublished data). pgm and adk hybridized to the same
set of fragments, including B7 and P3, which overlap by '50 kb. gdh
mapped on SpeI fragment S17 (35 kb).

six loci (Fig. 2) was extremely similar to that obtained by using
all 11 loci (data not shown) because the added resolution
achieved by using more loci was counterbalanced by the
decreased congruence obtained by using the extra loci. Isolates
assigned by MLEE to the seven hyper-virulent lineages were
distinguished clearly from each other and from other isolates
(Fig. 2). For each of the seven hyper-virulent lineages, either
all isolates tested were identical at all six loci (subgroups I and
IV-1, ET-37 complex) or, with two exceptions, they differed
from the most common ST at a single locus (subgroup III, A4
cluster, ET-5 complex, and lineage 3; Table 2). The two
exceptions, one ET-5 complex isolate and one A4 cluster
isolate, differed from the most common ST at two of the six
loci.
The serogroup A strains formed a cluster of lineages that
were distinct from strains of other serogroups, with the
exception of strain B534 (ST-21), and the major subgroups
associated with epidemic meningitis (I, III, and IV-1) were
distinguished easily (Fig. 2). The serogroup A strain B534 had
been assigned to subgroup I by Wang et al. (7) but was not
closely related to the other serogroup A strains by MLST.
Recent MLEE data (D.A.C., unpublished data) support the
MLST data and show that assignment of this strain to subgroup
I was incorrect. MLST did not distinguish between isolates of
serogroup A subgroups I and II, V and VII, IV-1 and IV-2, or
III and VIII, but these four pairs of subgroups are known to
be very closely related.
The A4 cluster and the ET-37 complex formed a cluster of
lineages that were distinct from other STs. The ET-5 and
lineage 3 strains each formed distinct clusters, although the
lineage 3 strains were not well resolved from some unrelated
STs.
Almost all of the isolates that had not been assigned to
known hyper-virulent lineages by MLEE had unique unrelated
STs. However, serogroup C strain BZ133 was identical to
serogroup A subgroup IyII bacteria (ST-1). The MLEE profile
of this strain was also indistinguishable from subgroup I
strains, and it probably represents a subgroup I organism that
has acquired a serogroup C capsule by transformation (18).
Two strains (NG H15, ST-43; NGE 30, ST-44) clustered within
lineage 3 according to the six gene fragments (Table 2). They
were related to, but distinct from, lineage 3 when all 11 genes
were compared and also differed from lineage 3 by MLEE.
Additional sequence data from other conserved genes would
be required to decide whether these two strains represent
diverse variants of lineage 3 or not. ST-36 contained two
isolates and STs 18–20 included four strains that clustered as
closely together as did isolates belonging to the hyper-virulent
lineages. These results suggest that additional lineages may
exist that have not been documented extensively until now.
DISCUSSION
MLEE has provided an invaluable population genetic frame-
work for bacterial and nonbacterial species and for the iden-
tification of clones that are particularly associated with disease
(1, 4, 19, 20). However, MLEE relies on the indirect assign-
ment of alleles based on the electrophoretic mobility of
enzymes, and indistinguishable mobility variants may be en-
coded by very different nucleotide sequences. In MLST, the
direct assignment of alleles based on nucleotide sequence
determination of internal fragments from multiple housekeep-
ing genes is unambiguous and distinguishes more alleles per
locus, thus allowing high levels of discrimination between
isolates by using half of the loci that are typically required for
MLEE. For the six gene fragments chosen for typing menin-
gococci, there was an average of 17 alleles per locus and the
potential to resolve over 24 million STs. The use of multiple
loci is essential to achieve the resolution required to provide
meaningful relationships among strains and is particularly
important because clones diversify with age, as a consequence
of mutational or recombinational events, and might be typed
incorrectly if only single loci were examined.
The relatively rapid diversification of clones by recombina-
tion was expected to be a significant problem with meningo-
cocci. However, the six loci chosen allow the reliable recog-
nition of the isolates of the known hyper-virulent lineages. The
members of each hyper-virulent lineage were identical at all six
loci or differed from the consensus ST for that clone at only
a single locus (with two exceptions) and were resolved on the
dendrogram from the other major lineages. Furthermore, most
of the other isolates were distinct from the hyper-virulent
lineages, with the exception of some of the minor subgroups of
serogroup A, and the strains that clustered among the lineage
3 strains. The inclusion of an additional highly congruent
housekeeping gene may be required to improve the resolution
of these strains.
MLEE is the currently accepted method for assigning
meningococci to the known hyper-virulent lineages. We be-
lieve the advantages of MLST over MLEE for the character-
ization of meningococci are so considerable that we have set
up a World-Wide Web site for MLST of meningococci (http:yy
mlst.zoo.ox.ac.uk). Besides its portability, MLST has the ad-
vantage that it can be used after PCR amplification from
clinical material (e.g., blood or cerebrospinal fluid), which is
increasingly important because early provision of antibiotic
treatment for meningitis results in bacteria being cultured less
frequently. Although we stress that all six loci should be used
to characterize meningococcal strains, it should be possible

during investigations of outbreaks for public health purposes to
determine rapidly whether the outbreak is caused by a single
strain by using only two or three loci, and this data may provide
a putative assignment to a known clonal lineage. Even with all
six loci, assignment of a meningococcus to a known hyper-
virulent lineage probably can be achieved at least as quickly
and economically as by any currently available method.
MLST is a simple technique, requiring only the ability to
amplify DNA fragments by PCR and to sequence the frag-
ments, using an automated sequencer or manually. These
techniques are, or will soon be, available to public health
laboratories in the developed world and to an increasing
number of laboratories in the developing world. Direct se-
quencing of '470-bp PCR products from hundreds of isolates
currently can be carried out rapidly and accurately by using an
automated DNA sequencer, and the complete assignment of
alleles at six loci (sequencing on both DNA strands) can be
accomplished by using only 12 lanes of a sequencing gel.
Sequencing services also are being offered increasingly on a
commercial basis, and the technology of automated sequenc-
ing is being improved rapidly.
The great advantage of MLST over MLEE and over mo-
lecular typing methods that rely on the comparisons of DNA
fragment sizes is the unambiguity and portability of sequence
data, which allow results from different laboratories to be
compared without exchanging strains. This ability will allow

laboratories in different countries and continents to relate
their local isolates to those found globally by submitting the
sequences from housekeeping gene fragments to a central
World-Wide Web site containing the MLST database for that
species. In addition, all of the components of an MLST
analysis—genomic DNA, PCR products, and nucleotide se-
quencing reactions—are highly portable among laboratories by
conventional mail, enabling typing to be carried out at remote
sites and easy comparison of results among reference labora-
tories.
The sequence data obtained for MLST can be used to
determine population structures by analyzing the extent of
linkage disequilibrium between alleles and to look for recom-
bination by the noncongruence of gene trees (21) and by the
presence of significant mosaic structure (22). For highly clonal
species, the phylogenetic relationships between isolates can be
inferred from the dendrogram derived from the pairwise
differences between STs and independently from a consensus
tree constructed from the gene sequences. For weakly clonal
species such as the meningococcus, MLST is very useful for the
identification of the currently circulating hyper-virulent lin-
eages because these are recognized as clusters of isolates with
identical, or very similar, multilocus sequence types. Phyloge-
netic inferences from weakly clonal populations should be
treated with caution, but the clustering of all serogroup A
subgroups (Fig. 2) suggests that these may be descended from
a common ancestor. Similarly, the close relationship between
the A4 cluster and ET-37 complex suggests that they may be
derived from a common ancestor. The population genetic
inferences from the meningococcal data set will be discussed
elsewhere.
We have chosen to develop and validate the utility of MLST
by using N. meningitidis, a species that presents a particular
challenge for typing methods, because of the rapid diversifi-
cation of meningococcal clones by frequent localized recom-
binational exchanges among lineages. Because recombination
did not prevent the identification of the hyper-virulent me-
ningococcal clones, MLST should be suitable for almost any
weakly clonal or clonal species with sufficient sequence diver-
sity. MLST recently has been developed and validated for the
identification of hyper-virulent clones of Streptococcus pneu-
moniae (M. C. Enright and B.G.S., unpublished work).
Currently, different typing methods often are used for the
same pathogens in different laboratories and, even when a
uniform method is used, the data are difficult to compare
between laboratories and are often unsuitable for evolution-
ary, phylogenetic, or population genetic studies. Acceptance of
MLST as the ‘‘gold standard’’ for typing bacterial pathogens
would resolve this highly unsatisfactory situation. MLEE com-
monly is used for typing and population genetic analysis of
pathogenic fungi and parasites, and MLST also should be
useful for the determination of the population structures of
nonbacterial haploid infectious agents and for portable mo-
lecular typing of those agents that are weakly or strongly clonal.
