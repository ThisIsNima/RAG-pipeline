Method—The National Comorbidity Survey-Adolescent Supplement NCS-A is a nationally
representative face-to-face survey of 10,123 adolescents aged 13–18 years in the continental U.S.
DSM-IV mental disorders were assessed using a modified version of the fully structured World
Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview.
Results—Anxiety disorders were the most common condition (31.9%), followed by behavior
disorders (19.1%), mood disorders (14.3%), and substance use disorders (11.4%), with
approximately 40% of those with one class of disorder also meeting criteria for another class of
lifetime disorder. The overall prevalence of disorders with severe impairment and/or distress was
22.2%; (11.2% with mood disorders; 8.3% with anxiety disorders; 9.6% behavior disorders). The
median age of onset for disorder classes was earliest for anxiety (6 years), followed by 11 years for
behavior, 13 years for mood, and 15 years for substance use disorders.
Conclusions—These findings provide the first prevalence data on a broad range of mental
disorders in a nationally representative sample of U.S. adolescents. Approximately one in every 4–
5 youth in the U.S. meets criteria for a mental disorder with severe impairment across their lifetime.
The likelihood that common mental disorders in adults first emerge in childhood and adolescence
highlights the need for a transition from the common focus on treatment of U.S. youth to that of
prevention and early intervention.

INTRODUCTION
There has been tremendous growth in the field of child psychiatric epidemiology over the past
two decades.1 The results of numerous community surveys in specific regions of the U.S.2–8
have shown that about one in every three to four children suffers from a mental disorder and
that about one in ten has a Serious Emotional Disturbance, 9–11 with few affected youth
receiving adequate mental health care. However, there has been a lack of empirical data on the
prevalence and distribution of a wide range of DSM-IV mental disorders from a nationally
representative sample of children or adolescents. Such information is necessary to establish
resource allocation priorities for prevention, treatment, and research.
Based on the recommendations of the landmark Surgeon General’s Report on Mental
Health12 and the recommendations of a subgroup of the National Institute of Mental Health
(NIMH) National Advisory Mental Health Council,13 the NIMH established several research
initiatives to address the lack of national statistics on mental health in children. Instruments
for assessing mental health were added to two large national surveys including the Strengths
and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) to the National Health Interview Survey,14 and selected
modules from the National Institute of Mental Health Diagnostic Interview Schedule for
Children (DISC) Version 415 to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.11 In
addition to these measures, the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R)16 was
extended to assess a broad range of DSM-IV disorders in a nationally representative sample
of youth aged 13–18 years, referred to as the National Comorbidity Survey Adolescent
Supplement (NCS-A).17–20
The goals of the present report are: (1) to present the lifetime prevalence estimates of mental
disorders and the proportion of disorders that are associated with severe impairment in a
nationally representative sample of U.S. adolescents; (2) to examine the magnitude of overlap
in the major classes of mental disorders; and (3) to describe the individual and familial
sociodemographic correlates of these disorders.

Method
Sample and Procedure
The NCS-A is a nationally representative, face-to-face survey of 10,123 adolescents aged 13–
18 years in the continental US.17 The survey was administered by the professional interview
staff of the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan. The NCS-A was carried
out in a dual-frame sample that included a household sub-sample and a school sub-sample.18,
20, 21 The overall NCS-A adolescent response rate combining the two sub-samples was 82.9%.
Comparisons of sample and population distributions on census sociodemographic variables
and the school sample on school characteristics revealed only minor differences that were
corrected with post-stratification weighting.
One parent or parent surrogate of each participating adolescent was asked to complete a self-
administered questionnaire (SAQ) that contained informant questions about the adolescent’s
mental health. The full SAQ was completed by 6,491 parents. These recruitment and consent
procedures were approved by the Human Subjects Committees of both Harvard Medical School
and the University of Michigan. Once the survey was completed, cases were weighted for
variation in within-household probability of selection (in the household sub-sample) and for
residual discrepancies between the sample and the US population on the basis of socio-
demographic and geographic variables. These weighting procedures are discussed in more
detail elsewhere.18, 20 Socio-demographic variables assessed in the NCS-A include age (in
years), sex, race/ethnicity, parent education, urbanicity, and marital status of parents. A poverty
index ratio, based on family size and the ratio of family income to the family’s poverty threshold
level, (≤1.5 poor, ≤3, ≤6, and > 6) was also included.
Table 1 presents the weighted socio-demographic characteristics of the study sample. About
half of the sample was male (51.3%) and the mean age was 15.2 years, with a larger proportion
of youth aged 13–14 years (36.2%), and approximately equal distributions of youth aged 15
(20.5%), 16 (21.0%), and 17–18 (22.3%) years. The sample was comprised of 65.6% non-
Hispanic Whites, 15.1% non-Hispanic Blacks, and 14.4% Hispanics. In terms of family
characteristics, 84.5% of the sample had parents who had completed at least high school, 14.7%
had a poverty index ratio at 1.5 or lower, nearly half of the sample resided in a metropolitan
area, and 78.6% had parents who were married or cohabiting.
Measures
Diagnostic assessment—Details of the diagnostic and risk factor measures are described
by Merikangas et al.17 Briefly, a modified version of the World Health Organization (WHO)
Composite International Diagnostic Interview Version 3.0 (CIDI), a fully structured interview
administered by trained lay interviewers to generate DSM-IV diagnoses16 was administered
to adolescents. Modifications to the CIDI involved enhancing the wording and appropriateness
of the instrument for assessment of adolescents. Lifetime disorders assessed in the CIDI
included mood disorders and episodes (major depressive disorder [MDD] or dysthymic
disorder, bipolar I or II [BPD]), anxiety disorders (panic disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia,
specific phobia, generalized anxiety disorder [GAD], posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD],
separation anxiety disorder [SAD]), behavior disorders (attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder
[ADHD], oppositional defiant disorder [ODD], and conduct disorder [CD]), substance use
disorders (alcohol abuse/dependence, drug abuse/dependence), and eating disorders (anorexia
nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder). Parents (or parent surrogates) were
mailed a self-administered questionnaire (SAQ) in order to collect additional information on
adolescent sociodemographic characteristics, developmental background, mental and physical
health, and other family- and community-level factors. Parents who completed the SAQ
provided full DSM-IV diagnostic information about MDD and dysthymic disorder, SAD,

ADHD, ODD, and CD, whereas those completing the abbreviated SAQ only reported on
ADHD. Based on prior research that has documented the value of supplemental parent
reports22, 23, information from both the parent and adolescent were combined for major
depression and behavior problems and classified as positive if either informant endorsed the
diagnostic criteria. Definitions of all psychiatric disorders adhered to DSM-IV criteria and
diagnostic hierarchy rules were applied for every disorder, with the exception of oppositional
defiant disorder and substance use disorders. Psychiatric disorders derived from the modified
CIDI showed good concordance with a clinical reappraisal sub-sample.19
Impairment criteria embedded in DSM-IV required endorsement of some/a lot/extreme level
of impairment or moderate/severe/very severe level of symptom severity. In order to more
clearly identify disorders that were clinically significant, our definition of severe lifetime
disorders used higher thresholds of impairment that required endorsement of “a lot” or
“extreme” impairment in daily activities, or “severe or very severe” distress. Severe emotional
disorders required both distress and impairment to be present, and severe behavior disorders
(ADHD, ODD, and CD) required endorsement of symptom criteria by both the parent and the
adolescent.
Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were completed with the SUDAAN software package and utilize the
Taylor series linearization method to take into account the complex survey design. Cross-
tabulations were used to calculate prevalence and comorbidity. Logistic regression analysis
was used to examine demographic correlates of prevalence; regression models included all
sociodemographic variables simultaneously, and adjusted odds ratios are presented. Age-of-
onset curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis method. Multivariate
significance tests were calculated using Wald Chi-Square tests based on coefficient variance-
covariance matrices that were adjusted for design effects using the Taylor series method.
Statistical significance was based on two-sided design-based tests evaluated at a level of
significance of 0.05.
Results
Lifetime Prevalence
Table 2 presents the lifetime prevalence rates of DSM-IV mental disorders by sex, age group,
total DSM-IV disorders and disorders with severe impairment. Mood disorders affected 14.3%
of the total sample, corresponding to 11.7% who met criteria for MDD or dysthymia and 2.9%
for BPD. Females were twice as likely to experience unipolar mood disorders as compared to
males, and somewhat more likely to experience BPD. The prevalence of all mood disorders
increased uniformly with age, with a nearly two-fold increase from the 13–14 year age group
to the 17–18 year age group. Severe cases of mood disorder (11.2% of the total sample)
represented 74.4% of all MDD or dysthymic disorders, and 89.7% of all cases of BPD. The
sex-specific rates for severe disorders (not presented in the table) maintained the same general
patterns as were observed for the overall prevalence rates.
Nearly one in three adolescents (31.9%) met criteria for an anxiety disorder, with rates for
individual disorders ranging from 2.2% for GAD to 19.3% for specific phobia. All anxiety
disorder subtypes were more frequent in females (the greatest sex difference being observed
for PTSD). The aggregate category of any anxiety disorder was stable across age groups, but
considerable variance was observed by disorder subtype. In particular, the prevalence of PTSD,
panic disorder, social phobia and GAD showed modest but consistent increases with age.
Severe anxiety disorders were present in 8.3% of the total sample, representing all individuals
with panic disorder or agoraphobia, a moderate proportion of individuals with GAD (54.5%)

or PTSD (30%), and only a small proportion of individuals with social phobia (14.3%), SAD
(7.9%) and specific phobia (3.1%); yielding prevalence rates of 1.3% for social phobia, and
0.6% for SAD and specific phobia, respectively.
The prevalence of ADHD was 8.7%, with three times as many males being affected by this
condition as females. The prevalence of severe ADHD was 4.2%, or approximately half of all
cases in the sample. ODD was present in 12.6% of the sample (6.5% for severe cases) and
6.8% met criteria for CD (2.2% for severe cases). Although the rates of ADHD and ODD
remained relatively stable by age group, rates of CD increased to a peak of 9.6% among the
oldest adolescents.
Substance use disorders were present in 11.4% of the sample, corresponding to 8.9% of
adolescents with drug abuse/dependence and 6.4% with alcohol abuse/dependence. These
disorders were somewhat more frequent in males, and a five to eleven-fold increase in
prevalence was observed across increasing age groups. The rates for severe substance use
disorders were identical to those of the DSM-IV disorders because impairment criteria were
embedded in the diagnostic definitions for these disorders. Concerning other conditions, 2.7%
of adolescents had manifested eating disorders at some point in their lifetime. These disorders
were more than twice as prevalent among females and demonstrated modest increases with
age.
Finally, 49.5% of the total sample was affected by at least one class of disorder, but less than
half had disorders with severe impairment (27.6%), and only 22.2% exclusive of substance use
disorders. Approximately 20% of the sample (40% of all affected individuals) also met criteria
for a disorder from at least one additional class. These comorbidity rates were similar for males
and females. No age differences were observed for adolescents affected by one class of
disorder, but comorbidity with additional classes strongly increased with age.
Figure 1 presents the age-specific incidence curves for each of the broad classes of lifetime
mental disorder. Anxiety disorders occurred earliest with a steep slope beginning in early
childhood, and leveling off after age 12. Risk was fairly low for mood and behavior disorders
until early adolescence when it began to rise steadily. Substance use disorders appeared to have
the latest age of onset with a steep increase in incidence after age 15. The estimated risk at age
18 was 17.6% for behavior disorders, 18.2% for mood disorders, 23.8% for substance use
disorders, and 26.2% for anxiety disorders. The median age of disorder onset was 6 for anxiety
disorders, 11 for behavior disorders, 13 for mood disorders, and 15 for substance use disorders
(data not shown).
Figure 2 displays the proportion of adolescents affected by one or more broad classes of
disorder among those with at least one DSM-IV disorder. A small majority of affected
adolescents (61%) met criteria for disorders from one class only, with anxiety disorders being
the most frequent condition to occur alone (35%) and smaller proportions having only behavior
(14%), mood disorders (6%), or substance use disorders (6%). About one-quarter (25%) of
adolescents affected by at least one class of disorder also met criteria for a disorder from one
additional class, 11.0% were affected by three classes of disorders and 3% were affected by
four classes of disorder.
Socio-demographic Correlates
Table 3 presents the results of multivariate analyses of the association between individual and
familial sociodemographic characteristics on classes of lifetime mental disorders in the
adolescents. Mood and anxiety disorders were more prevalent among females in these
multivariate analyses, whereas males had higher rates of behavior and substance use disorders.
Rates of mood and substance use disorders were higher among older adolescents. There were

few racial/ethnic differences in the major classes of mental disorders, with the exception of
increased rates of anxiety disorders and lower rates of substance use disorder among non-
Hispanic Black adolescents compared to non-Hispanic White adolescents, and higher rates of
mood disorders among Hispanic adolescents compared to non-Hispanic Whites.
With respect to parental characteristics, the prevalence rates of anxiety disorders, substance
use disorders and behavior disorders were higher for respondents whose parents were divorced
or separated relative to respondents of currently married or cohabitating parents. Rates of mood
disorders were lower among children of parents who were never married compared to currently
married or cohabitating parents. Parental poverty level and urbanicity were not associated with
any of the classes of mental disorder. However, the most consistent association between
parental characteristics and mental disorders in children emerged for parental education.
Adolescents whose parents were not college graduates were at increased risk for all disorder
classes.
The findings from multivariate analyses for these sociodemographic characteristics and classes
of severe mental disorders (results not shown, but available upon request) were highly similar
to those of all mental disorders, with limited exceptions. In particular, anxiety disorders were
more prevalent in older adolescents, among ‘other’ ethnic minorities, among adolescents whose
parents were not college graduates, and among adolescents whose parents were divorced or
separated.
Two-way interactions for any significant main effects were tested for each class of disorder.
After adjusting for family-wise experimental errors with a Bonferroni correction, no
interactions were observed between individual and parental demographic correlates and
anxiety or behavior disorders. There were four significant interactions for other disorders: (1)
the prevalence of mood disorders was higher in White adolescents in homes with higher levels
of parental education than that in Blacks and Hispanics; (2) rates of substance use disorders
increased more dramatically with age for males than females; (3) sex differences in substance
use disorders were largest for Blacks compared to other ethnic groups; and (4) increased rates
of substance use disorders were observed among Hispanic adolescents whose parents were
divorced, however, rates were decreased among Blacks whose parents were never married or
divorced.
Discussion
These findings provide the first lifetime prevalence data on a broad range of mental disorders
in a nationally representative sample of U.S. adolescents. The prevalence rates reported here
closely approximate those of our nationally representative sample of adults using nearly
identical methods, suggesting that the majority of mental disorders in adults emerge prior to
adulthood. These rates are somewhat higher than those of prior studies, but within the ranges
of estimates summarized in a meta-analysis of international community surveys of mental
disorders in youth.1 In addition, the NCS-A provides a more comprehensive assessment of a
wide range of DSM-IV disorders and subtypes than most previous studies. Despite the high
prevalence rates, however, only about one in every four-to-five youths meet criteria for a
lifetime mental disorder that is associated with severe role impairment and/or distress. The
prevalence of severe emotional and behavior disorders is even higher than the most frequent
major physical conditions in adolescence, including asthma24 or diabetes25 which have
received widespread public health attention.
The finding that only about half of youth with a lifetime DSM-IV disorder report severe
impairment confirms previous research demonstrating that a smaller proportion of youth with
mental disorders actually have sufficiently severe distress or impairment to warrant immediate

intervention.9 According to prior research, about one out of every ten youths with a current
mental disorder fulfill criteria for Serious Emotional Disorder (SED) based on the Substance
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMSHA) definition (e.g., a mental health
problem that has a drastic impact on a child’s ability to function socially, academically, and
emotionally). 9,26 While our study did not strictly assess all of the criteria for SED, our estimates
of severe disorders were based on the full diagnostic criteria for DSM-IV disorders
accompanied by severe impairment in major life roles.
Our data document the early onset of major classes of mental disorders. Among affected
adolescents, 50% of disorders had their onset by age 6 for anxiety disorders, by age 11 for
behavior disorders, by age 13 for mood disorders and by age 15 for substance use disorders.
These findings closely approximate those of prospective studies of child and adolescent
samples that have documented the incidence and progression of childhood mental disorders.
2, 27–29 The early age of onset of anxiety has been well-established and our findings on specific
subtypes of anxiety closely track those of prospective community-based research that reveal
differential peak periods of onset of specific subtypes of anxiety. 29–31 Prospective studies
have also shown that the average age of onset of major depression and dysthymia is between
11 and 14 years,6 with a steady increase in incidence across adolescence that continues through
early adulthood. Our cross-sectional data reflect this increase with a near doubling of rates
from 13–14 years (8.4%) to 17–18 years (15.4%). Also consistent with prior cross-sectional
and prospective research, the median onset of behavior disorders is slightly earlier than that of
mood disorders, with a later peak for conduct disorder than for oppositional defiant disorder.
32 Finally, the later onset and steeper increase in rates of substance use disorders across
adolescence has been repeatedly demonstrated, despite different prevalence periods and
assessment methods. 33
About 40% of affected youth in the NCS-A reported more than one class of lifetime disorder,
with mood disorders being the most likely to co-occur with other classes. Non-random patterns
of comorbidity between discrete classes of mental disorders have been documented extensively
in prior community samples of youth.34–36 Future analyses of these data will investigate
specific concurrent and prospective comorbidity patterns as well as their sociodemographic
and clinical correlates.
In addition to providing prevalence estimates, the findings also confirm observations from
previous U.S. and international investigations of adolescents concerning the association of
sociodemographic characteristics and mental disorders.1 In particular, female adolescents were
more likely than males to have mood and anxiety disorders, but less likely to have behavioral
and substance use disorders. Non-Hispanic Blacks were less likely to have substance use
disorders compared to Whites, a finding that is similar to prior community studies of
adolescents and adults.37 The increased prevalence of mood and substance use disorders in
older adolescents has also been observed in previous investigations,38 thus indicating the
importance of prevention strategies for early and mid-adolescence. By contrast, the stability
of certain anxiety and behavioral disorders across this same developmental period suggests
that earlier interventions before puberty may be appropriate for many of these conditions.
The strong links between adolescent mental disorders and parental characteristics indicate the
importance of the family context in the development of mental disorders. Our finding of a
prominent effect of parental education on mental disorders has been well-documented for both
child physical and mental health outcomes.39, 40 Divorce was often associated with mental
disorders in youth, particularly anxiety, behavior and substance use disorders. The mechanisms
underlying the impact of non-intact homes on mental disorders in youth, including both
biologic or genetic vulnerability, and indirect influences on disruptions in the home
environment, warrant further study.9, 41, 42 However, the significant interactions observed

among several sociodemographic characteristics attest to the complexity of these associations.
For example, increased rates of substance use disorders among Hispanic adolescents whose
parents were divorced may reflect interactions of individual, familial and broader
environmental influences that should be considered simultaneously in modeling the nature of
risk and resilience in adolescent mental disorders.43, 44 The lack of strong effects for some
sociodemographic characteristics, such as poverty, may also be attributable to the multivariate
statistical approach that adjusted for confounded variables.
The present findings should be interpreted in the context of several study-specific limitations.
First, the cross-sectional nature of the survey limits our ability to document temporal ordering
of mental disorders and putative risk and protective factors. Second, assessment of lifetime
disorders is based on retrospective recall that is subject to numerous types of bias. Although
we employed a number of methods to increase the validity of retrospective reports of age of
onset,21 it is unlikely that we were able to completely correct for recall biases. A third limitation
is that surrogate information was obtained only from one parent using a self-administered
questionnaire rather than a direct interview, and only for a limited number of disorders assessed
in the survey. The lack of prior evidence for integrating parent and child reports based on
different modes of administration led us to apply an empirical approach based on previous
research on cross-informant diagnostic estimates.23 In addition to study-specific limitations, a
critical view is warranted concerning current diagnostic nomenclature more generally.
Adolescence is a period of change and maturation in which emotional and behavioral
difficulties may be common, and it is difficult to establish universally acceptable definitions
of disorder or severity thresholds. The high comorbidity across classes of disorders also raises
questions regarding the permeability of diagnostic categories and the plasticity of adolescent
development. The pertinence of current and alternative developmentally-appropriate
diagnostic criteria for adolescent mental disorders deserves careful attention and would benefit
from continued debate.
Despite these limitations, our findings document the high prevalence of mental disorders in
youth, and specify that just over one in four-to-five adolescents in the general population suffers
from disorders that result in severe impairment. Considered with recent estimates indicating
that the annual economic burden of mental disorders on the well-being of American youth and
their families approaches a quarter of one trillion dollars45, these findings underscore the key
public health importance of mental health in American youth. The present data can inform and
guide the development of priorities for future research and health policy by providing
previously lacking prevalence estimates in a nationally representative sample of U.S.
adolescents, as well as the individual, familial and environmental correlates of mental
disorders. Prospective research is now needed to understand the risk factors for mental disorder
onset in adolescence, as well as the predictors of the continuity of these disorders into
adulthood.
