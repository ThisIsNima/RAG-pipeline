A haplotype map of the human genome
The International HapMap Consortium*
Inherited genetic variation has a critical but as yet largely uncharacterized role in human disease. Here we report a
public database of common variation in the human genome: more than one million single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) for which accurate and complete genotypes have been obtained in 269 DNA samples from four populations,
including ten 500-kilobase regions in which essentially all information about common DNA variation has been extracted.
These data document the generality of recombination hotspots, a block-like structure of linkage disequilibrium and low
haplotype diversity, leading to substantial correlations of SNPs with many of their neighbours. We show how the
HapMap resource can guide the design and analysis of genetic association studies, shed light on structural variation and
recombination, and identify loci that may have been subject to natural selection during human evolution.
Despite the ever-accelerating pace of biomedical research, the root
causes of common human diseases remain largely unknown, pre-
ventative measures are generally inadequate, and available treatments
are seldom curative. Family history is one of the strongest risk factors
for nearly all diseases—including cardiovascular disease, cancer,
diabetes, autoimmunity, psychiatric illnesses and many others—
providing the tantalizing but elusive clue that inherited genetic
variation has an important role in the pathogenesis of disease.
Identifying the causal genes and variants would represent an impor-
tant step in the path towards improved prevention, diagnosis and
treatment of disease.
More than a thousand genes for rare, highly heritable ‘mendelian’
disorders have been identiﬁed, in which variation in a single gene is
both necessary and sufﬁcient to cause disease. Common disorders, in
contrast, have proven much more challenging to study, as they
are thought to be due to the combined effect of many different
susceptibility DNA variants interacting with environmental factors.
Studies of common diseases have fallen into two broad categories:
family-based linkage studies across the entire genome, and popu-
lation-based association studies of individual candidate genes.
Although there have been notable successes, progress has been slow
due to the inherent limitations of the methods; linkage analysis has
low power except when a single locus explains a substantial fraction
of disease, and association studies of one or a few candidate genes
examine only a small fraction of the ‘universe’ of sequence variation
in each patient.
A comprehensive search for genetic inﬂuences on disease would
involve examining all genetic differences in a large number of affected
individuals and controls. It may eventually become possible to
accomplish this by complete genome resequencing. In the meantime,
it is increasingly practical to systematically test common genetic
variants for their role in disease; such variants explain much of the
genetic diversity in our species, a consequence of the historically
small size and shared ancestry of the human population.
Recent experience bears out the hypothesis that common variants
have an important role in disease, with a partial list of validated
examples including HLA (autoimmunity and infection)1, APOE4
(Alzheimer’s disease, lipids)2, Factor VLeiden (deep vein thrombosis)3,
PPARG (encoding PPARg; type 2 diabetes)4,5, KCNJ11 (type 2
diabetes)6, PTPN22 (rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes)7,8,
insulin (type 1 diabetes)9, CTLA4 (autoimmune thyroid disease, type
1 diabetes)10, NOD2 (inﬂammatory bowel disease)11,12, complement
factor H (age-related macular degeneration)13–15 and RET (Hirsch-
sprung disease)16,17, among many others.
Systematic studies of common genetic variants are facilitated by
the fact that individuals who carry a particular SNP allele at one site
often predictably carry speciﬁc alleles at other nearby variant sites.
This correlation is known as linkage disequilibrium (LD); a particu-
lar combination of alleles along a chromosome is termed a haplotype.
LD exists because of the shared ancestry of contemporary chromo-
somes. When a new causal variant arises through mutation—whether
a single nucleotide change, insertion/deletion, or structural altera-
tion—it is initially tethered to a unique chromosome on which it
occurred, marked by a distinct combination of genetic variants.
Recombination and mutation subsequently act to erode this associ-
ation, but do so slowly (each occurring at an average rate of about
1028 per base pair (bp) per generation) as compared to the number
of generations (typically 104 to 105) since the mutational event.
The correlations between causal mutations and the haplotypes on
which they arose have long served as a tool for human genetic
research: ﬁrst ﬁnding association to a haplotype, and then sub-
sequently identifying the causal mutation(s) that it carries. This was
pioneered in studies of the HLA region, extended to identify causal
genes for mendelian diseases (for example, cystic ﬁbrosis18 and
diastrophic dysplasia19), and most recently for complex disorders
such as age-related macular degeneration13–15.
Early information documented the existence of LD in the human
genome20,21; however, these studies were limited (for technical
reasons) to a small number of regions with incomplete data, and
general patterns were challenging to discern. With the sequencing of
the human genome and development of high-throughput genomic
methods, it became clear that the human genome generally
displays more LD22 than under simple population genetic models23,
and that LD is more varied across regions, and more segmentally
structured24–30, than had previously been supposed. These obser-
vations indicated that LD-based methods would generally have
great value (because nearby SNPs were typically correlated with
many of their neighbours), and also that LD relationships would

need to be empirically determined across the genome by studying
polymorphisms at high density in population samples.
The International HapMap Project was launched in October 2002
to create a public, genome-wide database of common human
sequence variation, providing information needed as a guide to
genetic studies of clinical phenotypes31. The project had become
practical by the conﬂuence of the following: (1) the availability of
the human genome sequence; (2) databases of common SNPs
(subsequently enriched by this project) from which genotyping
assays could be designed; (3) insights into human LD; (4) develop-
ment of inexpensive, accurate technologies for high-throughput SNP
genotyping; (5) web-based tools for storing and sharing data; and
(6) frameworks to address associated ethical and cultural issues32.
The project follows the data release principles of an international
community
resource
project
(http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/
doc_WTD003208.html), sharing information rapidly and without
restriction on its use.
The HapMap data were generated with the primary aim of guiding
the design and analysis of medical genetic studies. In addition, the
advent of genome-wide variation resources such as the HapMap
opens a new era in population genetics, offering an unprecedented
opportunity to investigate the evolutionary forces that have shaped
variation in natural populations.
The Phase I HapMap
Phase I of the HapMap Project set as a goal genotyping at least one
common SNPevery 5 kilobases (kb) across the genome in each of 269
DNA samples. For the sake of practicality, and motivated by the allele
frequency distribution of variants in the human genome, a minor
allele frequency (MAF) of 0.05 or greater was targeted for study. (For
simplicity, in this paper we will use the term ‘common’ to mean a
SNP with MAF $ 0.05.) The project has a Phase II, which is
attempting genotyping of an additional 4.6 million SNPs in each of
the HapMap samples.
To compare the genome-wide resource to a more complete
database of common variation—one in which all common SNPs
and many rarer ones have been discovered and tested—a representa-
tive collection of ten regions, each 500 kb in length, was selected from
the ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) Project33. Each
500-kb region was sequenced in 48 individuals, and all SNPs in
these regions (discovered or in dbSNP) were genotyped in the
complete set of 269 DNA samples.
The speciﬁc samples examined are: (1) 90 individuals (30 parent–
offspring trios) from the Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria (abbreviation
YRI); (2) 90 individuals (30 trios) in Utah, USA, from the Centre
d’Etude du Polymorphisme Humain collection (abbreviation CEU);
(3) 45 Han Chinese in Beijing, China (abbreviation CHB); (4) 44
Japanese in Tokyo, Japan (abbreviation JPT).
Because none of the samples was collected to be representative of a
larger population such as ‘Yoruba’, ‘Northern and Western European’,
‘Han Chinese’, or ‘Japanese’ (let alone of all populations from ‘Africa’,
‘Europe’, or ‘Asia’), we recommend using a speciﬁc local identiﬁer
(for example, ‘Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria’) to describe the samples
initially. Because the CHB and JPT allele frequencies are generally
very similar, some analyses below combine these data sets. When
doing so, we refer to three ‘analysis panels’ (YRI, CEU, CHBþJPT) to
avoid confusing this analytical approach with the concept of a
‘population’.
Important details about the design of the HapMap Project are
presented in the Methods, including: (1) organization of the project;
(2) selection of DNA samples for study; (3) increasing the number
and annotation of SNPs in the public SNP map (dbSNP) from
2.6 million to 9.2 million (Fig. 1); (4) targeted sequencing of the ten
ENCODE regions, including evaluations of false-positive and false-
negative rates; (5) genotyping for the genome-wide map; (6) intense
efforts that monitored and established the high quality of the data;
and (7) data coordination and distribution through the project Data
Coordination Center (DCC) (http://www.hapmap.org).
Description of the data. The Phase I HapMap contains 1,007,329
SNPs that passed a set of quality control (QC) ﬁlters (see Methods) in
each of the three analysis panels, and are polymorphic across the 269
samples. SNP genotyping was distributed across centres by chromo-
somal region, with several technologies employed (Table 1). Each
centre followed the same standard rules for SNP selection, quality
control and data release; all SNPs were genotyped in the full set of 269
samples. Some centres genotyped more SNPs than required by the
rules.
Extensive, blinded quality assessment (QA) exercises documented
that these data are highly accurate (99.7%) and complete (99.3%, see

also Supplementary Table 1). All genotyping centres produced high-
quality data (accuracy more than 99% in the blind QA exercises,
Supplementary Tables 2 and 3), and missing data were not biased
against heterozygotes. The Supplementary Information contains the
full details of these efforts.
Although SNP selection was generally agnostic to functional
annotation, 11,500 non-synonymous cSNPs (SNPs in coding regions
of genes where the different SNPalleles code for different amino acids
in the protein) were successfully typed in Phase I. (An effort was
made to prioritize cSNPs in Phase I in choosing SNPs for each 5-kb
region; all known non-synonymous cSNPs were attempted as part of
Phase II.)
Across the ten ENCODE regions (Table 2), the density of SNPs was
approximately tenfold higher as compared to the genome-wide map:
17,944 SNPs across the 5 megabases (Mb) (one per 279 bp).
More than 1.3 million SNP genotyping assays were attempted
(Table 3) to generate the Phase I data on more than 1 million SNPs.
The 0.3 million SNPs notpart of the Phase Idata set include73,652 that
passed QC ﬁlters but were monomorphic in all 269 samples. The
remaining SNPs failed the QC ﬁlters in one or more analysis panels
mostly because of inadequate completeness, non-mendelian inheri-
tance, deviations from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, discrepant
genotypes among duplicates, and data transmission discrepancies.
SNPs on the Phase I map are evenly spaced, except on Y and
mtDNA. The Phase I data include a successful, common SNP
every 5 kb across most of the genome in each analysis panel
(Supplementary Fig. 1): only 3.3% of inter-SNP distances are longer
than 10 kb, spanning 11.9% of the genome (Fig. 2; see also Sup-
plementary Fig. 2). One exception is the X chromosome (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 1), where a much higher proportion of attempted SNPs were
rare or monomorphic, and thus the density of common SNPs is lower.
Two intentional exceptions to the regular spacing of SNPs on the
physical map were the mitochondrial chromosome (mtDNA), which
does not undergo recombination, and the non-recombining portion
of chromosome Y. On the basis of the 168 successful, polymorphic
SNPs, each HapMap sample fell into one of 15 (of the 18 known)
mtDNA haplogroups34 (Table 4). A total of 84 SNPs that characterize
the unique branches of the reference Y genealogical tree35–37 were
genotyped on the HapMap samples. These SNPs assigned each Y
chromosome to 8 (of the 18 major) Y haplogroups previously
described (Table 4).
Highly accurate phasing of long-range chromosomal haplotypes.
Despite having collected data in diploid individuals, the inclusion of
parent–offspring trios and the use of computational methods made it
possible to determine long-range phased haplotypes of extremely
high quality for each individual. These computational algorithms
take advantage of the observation that because of LD, relatively few of
the large number of possible haplotypes consistent with the genotype
data actually occur in population samples.
The project compared a variety of algorithms for phasing haplo-
types from unrelated individuals and trios38, and applied the algo-
rithm that proved most accurate (an updated version of PHASE39)

separately to each analysis panel. (Phased haplotypes are available for
download at the Project website.) We estimate that ‘switch’ errors—
where a segment of the maternal haplotype is incorrectly joined to the
paternal—occur extraordinarily rarely in the trio samples (every 8 Mb
in CEU; 3.6 Mb in YRI). The switch rate is higher in the CHBþJPT
samples (one per 0.34 Mb) due to the lack of information from
parent–offspring trios, but even for the unrelated individuals, stat-
istical reconstruction of haplotypes is remarkably accurate.
Estimating properties of SNP discovery and dbSNP. Extensive
sequencing and genotyping in the ENCODE regions characterized
the false-positive and false-negative rates for dbSNP, as well as
polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based resequencing (see
Methods). These data reveal two important conclusions: ﬁrst, that
PCR-based sequencing of diploid samples may be biased against very
rare variants (that is, those seen only as a single heterozygote), and
second, that the vast majority of common variants are either
represented in dbSNP, or show tight correlation to other SNPs that
are in dbSNP (Fig. 3).

underlying allele frequency distributions for these samples are best

estimated from the ENCODE data, where deep sequencing reduces
bias due to SNP ascertainment. Consistent with previous studies,
most SNPs observed in the ENCODE regions are rare: 46% had
MAF , 0.05, and 9% were seen in only a single individual (Fig. 4).
Although most varying sites in the population are rare, most
heterozygous sites within any individual are due to common SNPs.
Speciﬁcally, in the ENCODE data, 90% of heterozygous sites in each
individual were due to common variants (Fig. 4). With ever-deeper
sequencing of DNA samples the number of rare variants will rise
linearly, but the vast majority of heterozygous sites in each person
will be explained by a limited set of common SNPs now contained (or
captured through LD) in existing databases (Fig. 3).
Consistent with previous descriptions, the CEU, CHB and JPT
samples show fewer low frequency alleles when compared to the YRI
samples (Fig. 5), a pattern thought to be due to bottlenecks in the
history of the non-YRI populations.
In contrast to the ENCODE data, the distribution of allele
frequencies for the genome-wide data is ﬂat (Fig. 5), with much
more similarity in the distributions observed in the three analysis
panels. These patterns are well explained by the inherent and
intentional bias in the rules used for SNP selection: we prioritized
using validated SNPs in order to focus resources on common (rather
than rare or false positive) candidate SNPs from the public databases.
For a fuller discussion of ascertainment issues, including a shift in
frequencies over time and an excess of high-frequency derived alleles
due to inclusion of chimpanzee data in determination of double-hit
status, see the Supplementary Information (Supplementary Fig. 3).
SNP allele frequencies across population samples. Of the 1.007
million SNPs successfully genotyped and polymorphic across the
three analysis panels, only a subset were polymorphic in any given
panel: 85% in YRI, 79% in CEU, and 75% in CHBþJPT. The joint
distribution of frequencies across populations is presented in Fig. 6
(for the ENCODE data) and Supplementary Fig. 4 (for the genome-
wide map). We note the similarity of allele frequencies in the CHB
and JPT samples, which motivates analysing them jointly as a single
analysis panel in the remainder of this report.
A simple measure of population differentiation is Wright’s FST,
which measures the fraction of total genetic variation due to
between-population differences40. Across the autosomes, FST esti-
mated from the full set of Phase I data is 0.12, with CEU and
CHBþJPT showing the lowest level of differentiation (FST ¼ 0.07),
and YRI and CHBþJPT the highest (FST ¼ 0.12). These values are
slightly higher than previous reports41, but differences in the types of
variants (SNPs versus microsatellites) and the samples studied make
comparisons difﬁcult.
As expected, we observed very few ﬁxed differences (that is, cases
in which alternate alleles are seen exclusively in different analysis
panels). Across the 1 million SNPs genotyped, only 11 have ﬁxed
differences between CEU and YRI, 21 between CEU and CHBþJPT,
and 5 between YRI and CHBþJPT, for the autosomes.
The extent of differentiation is similar across the autosomes, but
higher on the X chromosome (FST ¼ 0.21). Interestingly, 123 SNPs
on the X chromosome were completely differentiated between
YRI and CHBþJPT, but only two between CEU and YRI and one
between CEU and CHBþJPT. This seems to be largely due to a single
region near the centromere, possibly indicating a history of natural

dbSNP) were discovered only by ENCODE resequencing; they are
categorized by their correlation (r2) to those in dbSNP. Note that the
number of SNPs in each frequency bin differs among analysis panels,
because not all SNPs are polymorphic in all analysis panels.

Haplotype sharing across populations. We next examined the
extent to which haplotypes are shared across populations. We used
a hidden Markov model in which each haplotype is modelled in turn
as an imperfect mosaic of other haplotypes (see Supplementary
Information)42. In essence, the method infers probabilistically
which other haplotype in the sample is the closest relative (nearest
neighbour) at each position along the chromosome.
Unsurprisingly, the nearest neighbour most often is from the same
analysis panel, but about 10% of haplotypes were found most closely
to match a haplotype in another panel (Supplementary Fig. 5). All
individuals have at least some segments over which the nearest
neighbour is in a different analysis panel. These results indicate
that although analysis panels are characterized both by different
haplotype frequencies and, to some extent, different combinations of
alleles, both common and rare haplotypes are often shared across
populations.
Properties of LD in the human genome
Traditionally, descriptions of LD have focused on measures calcu-
lated between pairs of SNPs, averaged as a function of physical
distance. Examples of such analyses for the HapMap data are
presented in Supplementary Fig. 6. After adjusting for known
confounders such as sample size, allele frequency distribution,
marker density, and length of sampled regions, these data are highly
similar to previously published surveys43.
Because LD varies markedly on scales of 1–100 kb, and is often
discontinuous rather than declining smoothly with distance,
averages obscure important aspects of LD structure. A fuller explora-
tion of the ﬁne-scale structure of LD offers both insight into the
causes of LD and understanding of its application to disease research.
LD patterns are simple in the absence of recombination. The most
natural path to understanding LD structure is ﬁrst to consider the
simplest case in which there is no recombination (or gene conver-
sion), and then to add recombination to the model. (For simplicity
we ignore genotyping error and recurrent mutation in this discus-
sion, both of which seem to be rare in these data.)
In the absence of recombination, diversity arises solely through
mutation. Because each SNP arose on a particular branch of the
genealogical tree relating the chromosomes in the current popu-
lations, multiple haplotypes are observed. SNPs that arose on the
same branch of the genealogy are perfectly correlated in the sample,
whereas SNPs that occurred on different branches have imperfect
correlations, or no correlation at all.
We illustrate these concepts using empirical genotype data from 36
adjacent SNPs in an ENCODE region (ENr131.2q37), selected
because no obligate recombination events were detectable among
them in CEU (Fig. 7). (We note that the lack of obligate recombina-
tion events in a small sample does not guarantee that no recombi-
nants have occurred, but it provides a good approximation for
illustration.)
In principle, 36 such SNPs could give rise to 236 different haplo-
types. Even with no recombination, gene conversion or recurrent
mutation, up to 37 different haplotypes could be formed. Despite this
great potential diversity, only seven haplotypes are observed (ﬁve
seen more than once) among the 120 parental CEU chromosomes
studied, reﬂecting shared ancestry since their most recent common
ancestor among apparently unrelated individuals.
In such a setting, it is easy to interpret the two most common
pairwise measures of LD: D
0 and r 2. (See the Supplementary
Information for fuller deﬁnitions of these measures.) D
0 is deﬁned
to be 1 in the absence of obligate recombination, declining only due
to recombination or recurrent mutation27. In contrast, r2 is simply

and their contribution to heterozygosity. This ﬁgure shows the
polymorphic SNPs from the HapMap ENCODE regions according to minor
allele frequency (blue), with the lowest minor allele frequency bin (,0.05)
separated into singletons (SNPs heterozygous in one individual only, shown
in grey) and SNPs with more than one heterozygous individual. For this
analysis, MAF is averaged across the analysis panels. The sum of the
contribution of each MAF bin to the overall heterozygosity of the ENCODE
regions is also shown (orange).

the squared correlation coefﬁcient between the two SNPs. Thus, r2 is
1 when two SNPs arose on the same branch of the genealogy and
remain undisrupted by recombination, but has a value less than 1
when SNPs arose on different branches, or if an initially strong
correlation has been disrupted by crossing over.
In this region, D
0 ¼ 1 for all marker pairs, as there is no evidence of
historical recombination. In contrast, and despite great simplicity of
haplotype structure, r2 values display a complex pattern, varying
from 0.0003 to 1.0, with no relationship to physical distance. This
makes sense, however, because without recombination, correlations
among SNPs depend on the historical order in which they arose, not
the physical order of SNPs on the chromosome.
Most importantly, the seeming complexity of r2 values can be
deconvolved in a simple manner: only seven different SNP conﬁgur-
ations exist in this region, with all but two chromosomes matching
ﬁve common haplotypes, which can be distinguished from each
other by typing a speciﬁc set of four SNPs. That is, only a small
minority of sites need be examined to capture fully the information
in this region.
Variation in local recombination rates is a major determinant of
LD. Recombination in the ancestors of the current population has
typically disrupted the simple picture presented above. In the human
genome, as in yeast44, mouse45 and other genomes, recombination
rates typically vary dramatically on a ﬁne scale, with hotspots of
recombination explaining much crossing over in each region28. The
generality of this model has recently been demonstrated through
computational methods that allow estimation of recombination rates
(including hotspots and coldspots) from genotype data46,47.
The availability of nearly complete information about common
DNA variation in the ENCODE regions allowed a more precise
estimation of recombination rates across large regions than in any
previous study. We estimated recombination rates and identiﬁed
recombination hotspots in the ENCODE data, using methods
previously described46 (see Supplementary Information for details).
Hotspots are short regions (typically spanning about 2 kb) over
which recombination rates rise dramatically over local background
rates.
Whereas the average recombination rate over 500 kb across the
human genome is about 0.5 cM48, the estimated recombination rate
across the 500-kb ENCODE regions varied nearly tenfold, from a
minimum of 0.19 cM (ENm013.7q21.13) to a maximum of 1.25 cM
(ENr232.9q34.11). Even this tenfold variation obscures much more
dramatic variation over a ﬁner scale: 88 hotspots of recombination
were identiﬁed (Fig. 8; see also Supplementary Fig. 7)—that is, one
per 57 kb—with hotspots detected in each of the ten regions (from 4
in 12q12 to 14 in 2q37.1). Across the 5 Mb, we estimate that about
80% of all recombination has taken place in about 15% of the
sequence (Fig. 9, see also refs 46, 49).
A block-like structure of human LD. With most human recombina-
tion occurring in recombination hotspots, the breakdown of LD
is often discontinuous. A ‘block-like’ structure of LD is visually
apparent in Fig. 8 and Supplementary Fig. 7: segments of consistently
high D
0 that break down where high recombination rates, recombi-
nation hotspots and obligate recombination events50 all cluster.
When haplotype blocks are more formally deﬁned in the
ENCODE data (using a method based on a composite of local D

then calculated the frequency of this allele in each analysis panel/sample set.
The colour in each bin represents the number of SNPs that display each
given set of allele frequencies. The purple regions show that very few SNPs
are common in one panel but rare in another. The red regions show that
there are many SNPs that have similar low frequencies in each pair of

values30, or another based on the four gamete test51), most of the
sequence falls into long segments of strong LD that contain many
SNPs and yet display limited haplotype diversity (Table 5).
Speciﬁcally, addressing concerns that blocks might be an artefact
of low marker density52, in these nearly complete data most of the
sequence falls into blocks of four or more SNPs (67% in YRI to 87%
in CEU) and the average sizes of such blocks are similar to initial
estimates30. Although the average block spans many SNPs (30–70),
the average number of common haplotypes in each block ranged
only from 4.0 (CHB þ JPT) to 5.6 (YRI), with nearly all haplotypes
in each block matching one of these few common haplotypes. These
results conﬁrm the generality of inferences drawn from disease-
mapping studies27 and genomic surveys with smaller sample sizes29
and less complete data30.
Long-range haplotypes and local patterns of recombination.
Although haplotypes often break at recombination hotspots (and
block boundaries), this tendency is not invariant. We identiﬁed all
unique haplotypes with frequency more than 0.05 across the 269
individuals in the phased data, and compared them to the ﬁne-scale
recombination map. Figure 10 shows a region of chromosome 19
over which many such haplotypes break at identiﬁed recombination
hotspots, but others continue. Thus, the tendency towards co-
localization of recombination sites does not imply that all haplotypes
break at each recombination site.
Some regions display remarkably extended haplotype structure
based on a lack of recombination (Supplementary Fig. 8a, b). Most
striking, if unsurprising, are centromeric regions, which lack recom-
bination: haplotypes deﬁned by more than 100 SNPs span several
megabases across the centromeres. The X chromosome has multiple
regions with very extensive haplotypes, whereas other chromosomes
typically have a few such domains.
Most global measures of LD become more consistent when
measured in genetic rather than physical distance. For example,
when plotted against physical distance, the extent of pairwise LD

varies by chromosome; when plotted against average recombination
rate on each chromosome (estimated from pedigree-based genetic
maps) these differences largely disappear (Supplementary Fig. 6).
Similarly, the distribution of haplotype length across chromosomes
is less variable when measured in genetic rather than physical
distance. For example, the median length of haplotypes is 54.4 kb
on chromosome 1 compared to 34.8 kb on chromosome 21. When
measured in genetic distance, however, haplotype length is much
more similar: 0.104 cM on chromosome 1 compared to 0.111 cM on
chromosome 21 (Supplementary Fig. 9).
The exception is again the X chromosome, which has more
extensive haplotype structure after accounting for recombination
rate (median haplotype length ¼ 0.135 cM). Multiple factors could
explain different patterns on the X chromosome: lower SNP density,
smaller sample size, restriction of recombination to females and
lower effective population size.
A view of LD focused on the putative causal SNP
Although genealogy and recombination provide insight into why
nearby SNPs are often correlated, it is the redundancies among SNPs
that are of central importance for the design and analysis of
association studies. A truly comprehensive genetic association
study must consider all putative causal alleles and test each for its
potential role in disease. If a causal variant is not directly tested in the
disease sample, its effect can nonetheless be indirectly tested if it is
correlated with a SNP or haplotype that has been directly tested.

The typical SNP is highly correlated with many of its neighbours.
The ENCODE data reveal that SNPs are typically perfectly correlated
to several nearby SNPs, and partially correlated to many others.
We use the term proxy to mean a SNP that shows a strong
correlation with one or more others. When two variants are perfectly
correlated, testing one is exactly equivalent to testing the other; we
refer to such collections of SNPs (with pairwise r2 ¼ 1.0 in the
HapMap samples) as ‘perfect proxy sets’.
Considering only common SNPs (the target of study for the
HapMap Project) in CEU in the ENCODE data, one in ﬁve SNPs
has 20 or more perfect proxies, and three in ﬁve have ﬁve or more.
In contrast, one in ﬁve has no perfect proxies. As expected, perfect
proxy sets are smaller in YRI, with twice as many SNPs (two in ﬁve)
having no perfect proxy, and a quarter as many (5%) having 20 or
more (Figs 11 and 12). These patterns are largely consistent across
the range of frequencies studied by the project, with a trend
towards fewer proxies at MAF , 0.10 (Fig. 11). Put another way,
the average common SNP in ENCODE is perfectly redundant with
three other SNPs in the YRI samples, and nine to ten other SNPs in
the other sample sets (Fig. 13).
Of course, to be detected through LD in an association study,
correlation need not be complete between the genotyped SNP and
the causal variant. For example, under a multiplicative disease model
and a single-locus x 2 test, the sample size required to detect
association to an allele scales as 1/r2. That is, if the causal SNP has
an r2 ¼ 0.5 to one tested in the disease study, full power can be
maintained if the sample size is doubled.
The number of SNPs showing such substantial but incomplete
correlation is much larger. For example, using a looser threshold for
declaring correlation (r2 $ 0.5), the average number of proxies
found for a common SNP in CHBþJPT is 43, and the average in
YRI is 16 (Fig. 12). These partial correlations can be exploited
through haplotype analysis to increase power to detect putative
causal alleles, as discussed below.
Evaluating performance of the Phase I map. To estimate the
proportion of all common SNPs captured by the Phase I map, we

redundant haplotypes with frequency of at least 5% in the combined sample

events and blue few.

cumulative recombination fraction is plotted against the cumulative
proportion of sequence. If recombination rates were constant, each line
would lie exactly along the diagonal, and so lines further to the right reveal
the fraction of regions where recombination is more strongly locally
concentrated.

evaluated redundancy among SNPs on the genome-wide map, and
performed simulations based on the more complete ENCODE data.
The two methods give highly similar answers, and indicate that Phase
I should provide excellent power for CEU, CHB and JPT, and
substantial power for YRI. Phase II, moreover, will provide nearly
complete power for all three analysis panels.
Redundancies among SNPs in Phase I HapMap. Redundancy offers
one measure that Phase I has sampled densely in comparison to the
underlying scale of correlation. Speciﬁcally, 50% (YRI) to 75%
(CHBþJPT, CEU) of all SNPs on the Phase I map are highly
correlated (r2 $ 0.8) to one or more others on the map (Fig. 13;
see also Supplementary Fig. 10). Over 90% of all SNPs on the map
have highly statistically signiﬁcant correlation to one or more
neighbours. These partial correlations can be combined to form
haplotypes that are even better proxies for a SNP of interest.
Modelling Phase I HapMap from complete ENCODE data. A
second approach to evaluating the completeness of the Phase I data
involves thinning the more complete ENCODE data to match Phase I
for allele frequency and SNP density. Simulated Phase I HapMaps
were used to evaluate coverage in relation to the full set of common
SNPs (Table 6), and provided nearly identical estimates to those
above: 45% (YRI) to 74% (CHBþJPT, CEU) of all common SNPs are
predicted to have a proxy with r2 $ 0.8 to a SNP included in the
Phase I HapMap (Supplementary Fig. 11).
Statistical power in association studies may be more closely
approximated by the average (maximal) correlation value between
a SNP and its best proxy on the map, rather than by the proportion
exceeding an arbitrary (and stringent) threshold. The average values
for maximal r2 to a nearby SNP range from 0.67 (YRI) to 0.85 (CEU
and CHBþJPT).
Modelling Phase II HapMap from complete ENCODE data. A
similar procedure was used to generate simulated Phase II HapMaps
from ENCODE data (Table 6). Phase II is predicted to capture the
majority of common variation in YRI: 81% of all common SNPs
should have a near perfect proxy (r2 $ 0.8) to a SNP on the map,
with the mean maximal r2 value of 0.90. Unsurprisingly, the CEU,
CHB and JPT samples, already well served by Phase I, are nearly
perfectly captured: 94% of all common sites have a proxy on the map
with r2 $ 0.8, with an average maximal r2 value of 0.97.
These analyses indicate that the Phase I and Phase II HapMap
resources should provide excellent coverage for common variation in
these population samples.
Selection of tag SNPs for association studies
A major impetus for developing the HapMap was to guide the design
and prioritization of SNP genotyping assays for disease association
studies. We refer to the set of SNPs genotyped in a disease study as
tags. A given set of tags can be analysed for association with a

phenotype using a variety of statistical methods which we term tests,
based either on the genotypes of single SNPs or combinations of
multiple SNPs.
The shared goal of all tag selection methods is to exploit redun-
dancy among SNPs, maximizing efﬁciency in the laboratory while
minimizing loss of information24,27. This literature is extensive and
varied, despite its youth. Some methods require that a single SNP
serve as a proxy for other, untyped variants, whereas other methods
allow combinations of alleles (haplotypes) to serve as proxies; some
make explicit use of LD blocks whereas others are agnostic to such
descriptions. Although it is not practical to implement all such
methods at the project website, the HapMap genotypes are freely
available and investigators can apply their method of choice to the
data. To assist users, both a single-marker tagging method and a more
efﬁcient multimarker method have been implemented at http://
www.hapmap.org.
Tagging using a simple pairwise method. To illustrate general
principles of tagging, we ﬁrst applied a simple and widely used
pairwise algorithm53,54: SNPs are selected for genotyping until all
common SNPs are highly correlated (r2 $ 0.8) to one or more
members of the tag set.
Starting from the substantially complete ENCODE data, the
density of common SNPs can be reduced by 75–90% with essentially
no loss of information (Fig. 14). That is, the genotyping burden can
be reduced from one common SNP every 500 bp to one SNP every
2 kb (YRI) to 5 kb (CEU and CHBþJPT). Because LD often extends
for long distances, studies of short gene segments tend to under-
estimate the redundancy across the genome43.
Although tags selected based on LD offer the greatest improve-
ments in efﬁciency and information capture, even randomly chosen
subsets of SNPs offer considerable efﬁciencies (Fig. 14).
The data also reveal a rule of diminishing returns: a small set of
highly informative tags captures a large fraction of all variation, with
additional tags each capturing only one or a few proxies. For
example, in CHBþJPT the most informative 1% of all SNPs (one
per 50 kb) is able to proxy (at r2 $ 0.8) for 40% of all common SNPs,
whereas a substantial proportion of SNPs have no proxies at all.
These observations are encouraging with respect to genome-wide
association studies. A set of SNPs typed every 5–10 kb across the
genome (within the range of current technology) can capture nearly
all common variation in the genome in the CEU and CHBþJPT
samples, with more SNPs required in the YRI samples.
Tagging from the genome-wide map. Whereas analysis of
the complete ENCODE data set reveals the maximal efﬁciency
likely to be possible with this tag selection strategy, analysis of the
Phase I map illuminates the extent to which the current resource can
be used for near-term studies. Speciﬁcally, using the same pairwise
tagging approach above, 260,000 (CHBþJPT) to 474,000 (YRI)
SNPs are required to capture all common SNPs in the Phase I data
set (Table 7). That is, being incomplete and thus less redundant,
the Phase I data are much less compressible by tag SNP selection
than are the ENCODE data. Nevertheless, even at this level a half
to a third of all SNPs can be selected as proxies for the remainder
(and, by inference, the bulk of other common SNPs in the
genome).
Increasing the efﬁciency of tag SNPs. Although the pairwise method

Simulated Phase I HapMaps were generated from the phased ENCODE data (release 16c1)
by randomly picking SNPs that appear in dbSNP build 121 (excluding ‘non-rs’ SNPs in release
16a) for every 5-kb bin until a common SNP was picked (allowing up to three attempts per
bin). The Phase II HapMap was simulated by picking SNPs at random to achieve an overall
density of 1 SNP per 1 kb. These numbers are averages over 20 independent iterations for all
ENCODE regions in all three analysis panels.

is simple, complete and straightforward, efﬁciency can be improved
with a number of simple changes. First, relaxing the threshold on r2
for tag SNP selection substantially reduces the number of tag SNPs
selected, with only a modest decrease in the correlations among SNPs
(Table 7). For example, reducing the r2 threshold from 0.8 to 0.5
decreases the number of tag SNPs selected from the HapMap by 39%
in CHBþJPT (260,000 to 159,000) and 32% in YRI (474,000 to
325,000). The average r2 value between tags and other (unselected)
SNPs falls much less dramatically than the number of tags selected,
increasing efﬁciency. Whether such a loss of power is justiﬁed by the
disproportionate reduction in work is a choice each investigator will
need to make.
A second enhancement exploits multimarker haplotypes. Many
investigators have discussed using multiple SNPs (in haplotypes and
regression models) to serve as proxies for untyped sites55–58, which
may reduce the number of tags required and increase the power of
analyses performed. Figure 14 illustrates the point with one such
method55, showing that a multimarker method allows greater cover-
age for a ﬁxed set of markers (or, alternatively, fewer markers to
achieve the same coverage). Although a full consideration of this
issue is beyond the scope of this paper, the availability of these and
other data should allow the comparison and application of such
methods.
A third approach to increasing efﬁciency is to prioritize tags based
on the number of other SNPs captured. Whereas 260,000 SNPs are
required to provide r2 $ 0.8 for all SNPs in the Phase I HapMap
(CHBþJPT), the best 10,000 such SNPs (4%) capture 22% of all
common variable sites with r2 $ 0.8 (Table 8). Such prioritization
can be applied using different weights for SNPs based on genomic
annotation (for example, non-synonymous coding SNPs, SNPs in
conserved non-coding sequence, and candidate genes of biological
interest).
Tag transferability across populations. The most complete set of
tags would be those based on all 269 samples; however, many studies
may be performed in individuals more closely related to one
particular HapMap population, and efﬁciency may be gained by
selecting tags only from that population sample. (Selecting tags in a
HapMap population sample that is known to be more distantly
related than is another, for example, using CEU to pick tags for a
study of Japanese, seems inefﬁcient.)
An important question is how tags selected in one or more analysis
panels will transfer to disease studies performed in these or other
populations. Our data do not address this question directly, although
the known similarity of allele and haplotype frequencies across
populations within continents41 is encouraging. More data are clearly
needed, however.
Tag selection based on initial genotyping. Whereas the discussions
above assume de novo selection of SNPs, many investigators will
have already performed initial studies, and wish to design follow-
on experiments. The HapMap data can be used to highlight SNPs
that might potentially explain a positive association signal, or
those that were poorly captured (and thus still need to be tested)
after a negative scan. In cases where multiple SNPs are both
associated with the trait and with each other, the HapMap data
can be queried to identify whether samples from any other analysis
panel show a breakdown of LD in that region, and thus the
possibility of narrowing the span over which the causal variant
may reside.
Applications to the analysis of association data
Beyond guiding selection of tag SNPs, HapMap data can inform
the subsequent analysis and interpretation in disease association
studies.
Analysis of an existing genotype data set. The HapMap can be used
to inform association testing, regardless of how tags were selected.
Speciﬁcally, as long as the SNPs genotyped in a disease study have
also been typed in the HapMap samples, it is possible to identify
which SNPs are well captured by the genotyped SNPs (either singly,
or in haplotype combinations), and which are not55.
This is of particular importance for genome-wide association
studies performed using array-based, standardized genotyping
reagents, which do not allow investigators to choose their own sets
of tag SNPs. The Affymetrix 120K SNP array data included in Phase I
of the HapMap provides a simple example: in CEU 48% of HapMap
SNPs have substantial pairwise correlation (r2 $ 0.5) to one or more
of the 120K SNPs on the array. An additional 13%, however, are not
correlated to a single SNP, but are to a speciﬁc haplotype of two
members of the 120K panel. By identifying such haplotype predictors
in the HapMap, and testing them (in addition to the single SNPs) in a
disease study, it is likely that power will be increased (I. Pe’er et al.,
manuscript in preparation).
Evaluating statistical signiﬁcance and interpreting results. An
important challenge in genome-wide association testing is to develop
statistical procedures that minimize false positives without greatly
sacriﬁcing true positives. The challenge is ampliﬁed by the correlated
nature of polymorphism data, which makes simple frequentist
approaches that assume independence (such as Bonferonni correc-
tion) highly conservative. To illustrate this point, we used the
ENCODE data to estimate the ‘effective number of independent
tests’ (the statistical burden of testing all common (MAF $ 0.05)
variation) across large genomic regions. Speciﬁcally, we re-sampled
from the phased ENCODE chromosomes to create mock case-
control panels in which all common SNPs were observed, but there
was not a causal allele. The resulting x2 distribution for association
indicates that complete testing of common variation in each 500-kb
region is equivalent to performing about 150 independent statistical
tests (in CEU and CHBþJPT) and about 350 tests (in YRI). Although
it will probably be desirable to perform such empirical estimates of
signiﬁcance within each disease study, these results illustrate
how Bonferonni correction overestimates the statistical penalty of
performing many correlated tests.
Study of less common alleles. We have focused primarily on the
hypothesis that a single, common causal allele exists, and needs to be
tested for association to disease. Of course, in many cases the causal
allele(s) will be less common, and might be missed by such an
approach.
It is possible to perform additional haplotype tests, beyond those

that capture known polymorphisms, in the hope of capturing less
common or unrepresented alleles56. Such haplotype analysis has a
long history and proven value in mendelian genetics; the causal
mutation is generally rare and unexamined during initial geno-
typing, but is frequently recognized by its presence on a long, unique
haplotype of common alleles18,19,59–62.
Admixture mapping. Although not designed speciﬁcally to enable
admixture mapping63, the HapMap has helped lay the groundwork
for this approach. Admixture mapping requires a map of SNPs that
are highly differentiated in frequency across population groups. By
typing many SNPs in samples from multiple geographical regions,
the data have helped to identify such SNPs for the design of genome-
wide admixture mapping panels64,65 and can be further used to
identify candidate SNPs with large allele frequency differences for
follow-up of positive admixture scan results66.
Loss of heterozygosity in tumours. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in
tumour tissue can be a powerful indicator of the location of tumour
suppressor genes, and genome-wide, ﬁne-scale LOH analysis has
been empowered by genome-wide SNP arrays67. Germline DNA is
not always available from the same subjects, however, and even if
available, typing of germline DNA doubles project costs. In lower
density scans for LOH (with markers far apart relative to the scale of
LD), long runs of homozygosity in tumours are nearly always
indicative of LOH. However, at higher densities runs of homo-
zygosity can be due to haplotype homozygosity in the inherited
germline DNA, rather than LOH.
The HapMap data can help minimize this difﬁculty; previous
probabilities for homozygosity based on known frequencies of
haplotypes in the HapMap data can be used to distinguish homo-
zygosity due to haplotype sharing rather than LOH68.
Identifying structural variants in HapMap data
Structural variations—segments where DNA is deleted, duplicated,
or rearranged—are common69,70 and have an important role in
diseases71–73. The HapMap can provide some insight into structural
variation because, in many cases, structural variants reveal
themselves through signatures in SNP genotype data. In particular,
polymorphic deletions are important to discover, because loss of
genetic material is of obvious functional relevance, and results
in aberrant patterns of SNP genotypes. These include apparent
non-mendelian inheritance of SNP alleles, null genotypes and
deviations from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. However, such
SNPs are routinely discarded as technical failures of genotyping.
Thus, we scanned the unﬁltered Phase I HapMap data using an
approach developed and validated to identify polymorphic del-
etions from clusters of SNPs with aberrant genotype patterns
(calibrated across the multiple centres and genotyping plat-
forms74). In total, 541 candidate deletion polymorphisms were
identiﬁed, of which 150 were common enough to be observed as
homozygotes.
The properties of these candidate deletions, including experimen-
tal validation of 90 candidates, are described in ref. 74. Validated

throughout the genome. The results of model ﬁtting are summarized for the
CHBþJPTanalysis panel, by plotting the ﬁtted r2 value for SNPs separated
by 30 kb. The overall pattern of variation was very similar in the other
analysis panels84 (see Supplementary Information).

polymorphisms include 10 that remove coding exons of genes, such
that in many cases individuals are homozygous null for the encoded
transcript. Analysis of conﬁrmed deletions often shows strong LD
with nearby SNPs, indicating that LD-based approaches can be useful
for detecting disease associations due to structural (as well as SNP)
variants.
Polymorphic inversions may also be reﬂected in the HapMap
data as long regions where multiple SNPs are perfectly correlated:
because recombination between an inverted and non-inverted copy
is lethal, the inverted and non-inverted copies of the region evolve
independently. A striking example corresponds to the known inver-
sion polymorphism on chromosome 17, present in 20% of the CEU
chromosomes, that has been associated with fertility and total
recombination rate in females among Icelanders75. Long LD may
also arise, however, due to a low recombination rate or certain forms
of natural selection, as discussed below.
Insights into recombination and natural selection
In addition to its intended function as a resource for disease studies,
the HapMap data provide clues about the biology of recombination
and history of natural selection.
A genome-wide map of recombination rates at a ﬁne scale. On the
basis of the HapMap data, we created a ﬁne-scale genetic map
spanning the human genome (Supplementary Fig. 12), including
21,617 identiﬁed recombination hotspots (one per 122 kb).
Both the number and intensity of hotspots contribute to overall
variation in recombination rate. For example, we selected 25 regions
of 5 Mb as having the highest (.2.75 cM Mb21) and lowest
(,0.5 cM Mb21) rates of recombination in the deCODE (pedigree-
based) genetic map48. We detected recombination hotspots in all
regions, even the lowest. But in the high cM Mb21 regions hotspots
are more closely spaced (one per 84 kb) and have a higher average
intensity (0.124 cM) as compared to the low cM Mb21 regions (one
every 208 kb, and 0.051 cM, respectively).
Estimates of recombination rates and identiﬁed hotspots are
robust to the speciﬁc markers and samples studied. Speciﬁcally, we
compared these results to a similar analysis76 of the data of ref. 77
(with about 1.6 million SNPs genotyped in 71 individuals). We ﬁnd
nearly complete correlation in rate estimates at a coarse scale (5 Mb)
between these two surveys (r2 ¼ 0.99) and to the pedigree map
(r2 ¼ 0.95). Very substantial correlation is found at ﬁner scales:
r2 ¼ 0.8 at 50 kb and r2 ¼ 0.59 at 5 kb. Moreover, of the 21,617
hotspots identiﬁed using the HapMap data, 78% (16,923) were also
identiﬁed using the data of ref. 77.
The ability to detect events depends on marker density, with the
larger number of SNPs studied by ref. 77 increasing power to detect
hotspots, and presumably precision of rate estimates. There are,
however, substantial genomic regions where the HapMap data have a
higher SNP density. For example, more hotspots are detected on
chromosomes 9 and 19 from the HapMap data. We expect that Phase
II of HapMap will provide a genome-wide recombination map of
substantially greater precision than either ref. 77, or Phase I, at ﬁne
scales.
Little is yet known about the molecular determinants of recombi-
nation hotspots. In an analysis of the data of ref. 77, another study
(ref. 76) found signiﬁcant evidence for an excess of the THE1A/B
retrotransposon-like elements within recombination hotspots, and
more strikingly for a sixfold increase of a particular motif
(CCTCCCT) within copies of the element in hotspots, compared
to copies of the element outside hotspots. In analysing the HapMap
data, we conﬁrmed these ﬁndings (Supplementary Fig. 13). Further-
more, THE1B elements with the motif are particularly enriched
within 1.5 kb of the centre of the hotspots compared to ﬂanking
sequence (P , 10216).
Correlations of LD with genomic features. Variation in recombina-
tion rate is important, in large part, because of its impact on LD. We
thus examined genome-wide LD for correlation to recombination
rates, sequence composition and gene features.
We conﬁrmed previous observations that LD is generally low near
telomeres, elevated near centromeres, and correlated with chromo-
some length (Fig. 15; see also Supplementary Figs 8b and 14)48,78–80.
These patterns are due to recombination rate variation as discussed
above. We also conﬁrmed previously described relationships between
LD and GþC content78,81,82, sequence polymorphism83 and repeat
composition78,82.
We observe, for the ﬁrst time, that LD tracks with both the density
and functional classiﬁcation of genes. We examined quartiles of the
genome based on extent of LD, and looked for correlations to gene
density. Surprisingly, we ﬁnd that both the top and bottom quartiles
of the genome have greater gene density as compared to the middle
quartiles (6.7 as compared to 6.1 genes per Mb), as well as percentage
of bases in codons (1.24% as compared to 1.08%). We have no
explanation for this observation.
Although the majority of gene classes are equally divided between
these two extreme quartiles of the genome, some classes of genes
show a marked skew in their distribution64,84,85. Genes involved in
immune responses and neurophysiological processes are more often
located in regions of low LD, whereas genes involved in DNA and
RNA metabolism, response to DNA damage and the cell cycle are
preferentially located in regions of strong linkage disequilibrium. It is
intriguing to speculate that the extent of LD (and sequence diversity)
might track with gene function due to natural selection, with
increased diversity being favoured in genes involved in interface
with the environment such as the immune response86, and disad-
vantageous for core cell biological processes such as DNA repair and
packaging87,88.
Natural selection. The preceding observation highlights the hypoth-
esis that signatures of natural selection are present in the HapMap
data. The availability of genome-wide variation data makes it

possible to scan the genome for such signatures to discover genes that
were subject to selection during human evolution89; the HapMap
data also provide a genome-wide empirical distribution against
which previous claims of selection can be evaluated (rather than
relying solely on theoretical computer simulations).
Natural selection inﬂuences patterns of genetic variation in var-
ious ways, such as through the removal of deleterious mutations, the
ﬁxation of advantageous variants, and the maintenance of multiple
alleles through balancing selection. Each form of selection may have
occurred uniformly across the world (and thus be represented in all
human populations) or have been geographically localized (and thus
differ among populations).
Nearly all methods for recognizing natural selection rely on the
collection of complete sequence data. The HapMap Project’s focus on
common variation—and the process of SNP selection that achieved a
preponderance of high-frequency alleles (Fig. 5)—thus prevents their
straightforward application. Adjusting for the effect of SNP choice is
complex, moreover, because SNP choice varied over time as dbSNP
evolved, and was implemented locally at each centre.
For these reasons, we focus here on two types of analysis. First, we
examined the distributions of signatures of selection across the
genome. Although the absolute value of these measures is difﬁcult
to interpret (owing to SNP ascertainment), the most extreme cases in
a genome-wide distribution are important candidates to evaluate for
selection. Second, we compared across functional categories, because
SNP choice was largely agnostic to such features, and thus systematic
differences may be a sign of selection.
The outcomes of these analyses conﬁrm a number of previous
hypotheses about selection and identify new loci as candidates for
selection.
Evidence for selective sweeps in particular genomic regions. First
we consider population differentiation, generally accepted as a clue
to past selection in one of the populations. The HapMap data reveal
926 SNPs with allele frequencies that differ across the analysis panels

around the HBB gene is highlighted by the red point. In the CEU
analysis panel, diversity within the LCT gene region is similarly
highlighted.

in a manner as extreme as the well-accepted example of selection at
the Duffy (FY) locus (Supplementary Fig. 8c). Of these 926 SNPs, 32
are non-synonymous coding SNPs and many others occur in tran-
scribed regions, making them strong candidates for functional
polymorphisms that have experienced geographically restricted
selection pressures (see Table 9 and Supplementary Information
for details). In particular, the ALMS1 gene on chromosome 2 has
six amino acid polymorphisms that show very strong population
differentiation.
Another signature of an allele having risen to ﬁxation through
selection is that all other diversity in the region is eliminated (known
as a selective sweep). We identiﬁed extreme outliers in the joint
distribution of heterozygosity (as assessed from shotgun sequencing
SNP discovery projects) and either population differentiation or
skewing of allele frequency towards rare alleles in each analysis
panel (Supplementary Fig. 15). We identiﬁed 19 such genomic
regions (13 on autosomes, 6 on the X chromosome) as candidates
for future study (Supplementary Table 4); these include candidates
for population-speciﬁc sweeps and sweeps in the ancestral
population. Encouragingly, this analysis includes among its top-
scoring results the LCT gene, which inﬂuences the ability to digest
dairy products90 and has been shown to be subject to past natural
selection91.
Long haplotypes as candidates for natural selection. Selective
sweeps that fail to ﬁx in the population, as well as balancing selection,
lead to haplotypes that are relatively high in frequency and long in
duration. In the HLA region (which is widely believed to have been
inﬂuenced by balancing selection) multiple haplotypes of 500 SNPs
that extend more than 1 cM in length are observed with a frequency
in the HapMap samples of more than 1%. We identiﬁed other such
occurrences of long haplotypes across the genome (Supplementary
Fig. 8 and Supplementary Tables 5 and 6).
An approach to long haplotypes designed speciﬁcally to identify
regions having undergone partial selective sweeps is the long range
haplotype (LRH) test91,92, which compares the length of each haplo-
type to that of others at the locus, matched across the genome based
on frequency. Previously identiﬁed outliers to the genome-wide
distribution for the LRH test (Fig. 16) that have been identiﬁed as
candidates for selection include the LCT gene in the CEU sample
(empirical P-value ¼ 1.3 £ 1029), which was an outlier for the
heterozygosity/allele frequency test above, and the HBB gene
(empirical P-value ¼ 1.39 £ 1025) in the YRI sample. However,
most of the strongest signals in the LRH test (Table 10) were not
previously hypothesized as undergoing selection.
These four tests overlap only partially in the hypotheses they
address—heterozygosity, for example, is sensitive to older sweeps,
whereas the haplotype tests are most powerful for partial sweeps—
but encouragingly some candidate regions are found by more than
one test. In particular, six regions are identiﬁed both by long
haplotypes and by low heterozygosity, and three regions (LCT on
chromosome 2, and two regions on the X chromosome at 20 and
65 Mb) are identiﬁed by three different tests.
Conﬁrming purifying selection at conserved non-coding
elements. Finally, we used the HapMap data to test an important
hypothesis from comparative genomics. Genomic sequencing has
shown that about 5% of the human sequence is highly conserved
across species, yet less than half of this sequence spans known
functional elements such as exons45. It is widely assumed that
conserved non-genic sequences lack diversity because of selective
constraint (that is, purifying selection), but such regions may simply
be coldspots for mutation, and thus be of little value as candidates for
functional study.
Analysis of allele frequencies helps to resolve this uncertainty.
Functional constraint, but not a low mutation rate, results in a
downward skew in allele frequencies for conserved sequences as
compared to neutral sequences93,94. We ﬁnd that conserved non-
genic sequences display a greater skew towards rare alleles than do
intergenic regions, as predicted under purifying selection. This skew
is less extreme than that observed for exons (Supplementary Fig. 16),
reﬂecting either stronger purifying selection or the prioritization of
coding SNPs for genotyping by the HapMap centres regardless of
validation status. This novel evidence for ongoing constraint shows
that conserved non-genic sequences are not mutational coldspots,
and thus remain of high interest for functional study.
Conclusions
The International HapMap Project set out to create a resource that
would accelerate the identiﬁcation of genetic factors that inﬂuence
medical traits. Analyses reported here conﬁrm the generality
of hotspots of recombination, long segments of strong LD,
and limited haplotype diversity. Most important is the extensive
redundancy among nearby SNPs, providing (1) the potential to
extract extensive information about genomic variation without
complete resequencing, and (2) efﬁciencies through selection of
tag SNPs and optimized association analyses. Beyond the bio-
medical context, these data have made it possible to identify deletion
variants in the genome, explore the nature of ﬁne-scale recombina-
tion and identify regions that may have been subject to natural
selection.
The HapMap Project (along with a previous genome-wide assess-
ment of LD77) is a natural extension of the Human Genome Project.
Where the reference sequence constructed by the Human Genome
Project is informative about the vast majority of bases that are
invariant across individuals, the HapMap focuses on DNA sequence
differences among individuals. Our understanding of SNP variation
and LD around common variants in the sampled populations is
reasonably complete; the current picture is unlikely to change with
additional data. In other aspects—such as the ﬁne details of local
correlation among SNPs, rarer alleles, structural variants, and inter-
population differences—these resources are only a ﬁrst step on the
path towards a complete characterization of genetic variation of the
human population. Planned extensions of the Phase I map include
Phase II of HapMap, with genotyping of another 4.6 million SNPs
attempted in the HapMap samples, and detailed genotyping of the
HapMap ENCODE regions in additional members of each HapMap
population sampled, as well as in samples from additional popu-
lations. These results should guide understanding of the robustness
and transferability of LD inferences and tag SNPs selected from the
current set of HapMap samples.
An important application of the HapMap data is to help make
possible comprehensive, genome-wide association studies. There are
now laboratory tools that make it practical to undertake such studies,
and initial results are encouraging13. Given the low prior probability
of causality for each SNP in the genome, however, rigorous standards
of statistical signiﬁcance will be needed to avoid a ﬂood of
false-positive results. Multiple replications in large samples provide
the most straightforward path to identifying robust and broadly
relevant associations. Given the potential for confusion if associ-
ations of uncertain validity are widely reported (and a persistent
tendency towards genetic determinism in public discourse), we urge
conservatism and restraint in the public dissemination and interpret-
ation of such studies, especially if non-medical phenotypes are
explored. It is time to create mechanisms by which all results of
association studies, positive and negative, are reported and discussed
without bias.
The success of the HapMap will be measured in terms of the
genetic discoveries enabled, and improved knowledge of disease
aetiology. Speciﬁcally, identifying which genes and pathways are
causal in humans has the potential to provide a new and solid
foundation for biomedical research. This is equally true whether the
variants that lead to the discovery of those genes are themselves rare
or common, or of large or small effect. The impact on diagnostics and
targeted prevention, however, will depend on how predictive each
given allele may be. Where genetic mechanisms underlie treatment

responses, both more efﬁcient trials and individualized preventive
and treatment strategies may become practical95.
Success identifying alleles conferring susceptibility or resistance to
common diseases will also provide a deeper understanding of the
architecture of disease: how many genes are involved in each case,
whether and how alleles interact with one another96 and with
environmental exposures to shape clinical phenotypes. In this regard,
it will be important to invest heavily in the discovery and character-
ization of relevant lifestyle factors, environmental exposures, detailed
characterization of clinical phenotypes, and the ability to obtain such
information in longitudinal studies of adequate size. Where environ-
mental and behavioural factors vary across studies, replication will be
hard to come by (as will clinical utility) unless we can learn to capture
these variables with the same precision and completeness as geno-
typic variation. Technological innovation and international collab-
oration in these realms will probably be required (as they have been
in the Human Genome Project and the HapMap) to advance the
shared goal of understanding, and ultimately preventing, common
human diseases.
METHODS
The project was undertaken by investigators from Japan, the United Kingdom,
Canada, China, Nigeria and the United States, and from multiple disciplines:
sample collection, sequencing and genotyping, bioinformatics, population
genetics, statistics, and the ethical, legal, and social implications of genetic
research. The Supplementary Information contains information about project
participants and organization.
Choice of DNA samples. Any choice of DNA samples represents a compromise:
a single population offers simplicity, but cannot be representative, whereas grid-
sampling is representative of the current worldwide population, but is neither
practical nor captures historical genetic diversity. The project chose to include
DNA samples based on well-known patterns of allele frequencies across
populations41, reﬂecting historical genetic diversity31,32.
For practical reasons, the project focused on SNPs present at a minor allele
frequency (MAF) $ 0.05 in each analysis panel, and thus studied a sufﬁcient
number of individuals to provide good power for this frequency range31.
Cell lines and DNA are available at the Coriell Institute for Medical Research
(http://locus.umdnj.edu/nigms/products/hapmap.html).
Community engagement was employed toexplain the project, and tolearn how
the project was viewed, in the communities where samples were collected31,32.
Papers describing the community engagement processes are being prepared.
One JPT sample was replaced for technical reasons, but not in time for
inclusion in this report. We surveyed cryptic relatedness among the study
participants, and identiﬁed a small number of pairs with unexpectedly high allele
sharing (Supplementary Information). As the total level of sharing is notgreat, and
as a subset of analyses performed without these individuals were unchanged, we
include these individuals in the data and analyses presented here.
Genome-wide SNP discovery. The project required a dense map of SNPs, ideally
containing information about validation and frequency of each candidate SNP.
When the project started, the public SNP database (dbSNP) contained
2.6 million candidate SNPs, few of which were annotated with the required
information.
To generate more SNPs and obtain validation information, shotgun sequen-
cing of DNA from whole-genome libraries and ﬂow-sorted chromosomes was
performed31, augmented by analysis of sequence traces produced by Applied
Biosystems97,98, and information on 1.6 million SNPs genotyped by Perlegen
Sciences77, including 425,000 not in dbSNP when released (Supplementary
Table 7). The HapMap Project contributed about 6 million new SNPs to dbSNP.
At the time of writing (October 2005) dbSNP (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
projects/SNP/) contains 9.2 million candidate human SNPs, of which 3.6 million
have been validated by both alleles having been seen two or more times during
discovery (‘double-hit’ SNPs), and 2.4 million have genotype data (Fig. 1).
Comprehensive study of common variation across 5 Mb of DNA. To study
patterns of genetic variation as comprehensively as possible, we selected ten 500-
kb regions from the ENCODE Project33. These ten regions were chosen in
aggregate to approximate the genome-wide average for GþC content, recombi-
nation rate, percentage of sequence conserved relative to mouse sequence, and
gene density (Table 2).
In each such region additional sequencing and genotyping were performed to
obtain a much more complete inventory of common variation. Speciﬁcally,
bidirectional PCR-based sequencing was performed across each 500-kb region in
48 individuals (16 YRI, 16 CEU, 8 CHB, 8 JPT). Although the intent was for these
same DNA samples to be included in Phase I, eight Yoruba and one Han Chinese
sample used in sequencing were not among the 269 samples genotyped. (The
nine samples are available from Coriell.)
All variants found by sequencing, and any others in dbSNP (build 121) not
found by sequencing, were genotyped in all 269 HapMap samples. If the ﬁrst
attempt at genotyping was unsuccessful, a second platform was tried for each SNP.
False-positive and false-negative rates in PCR-based SNP discovery. The
false-positive rate of SNP discovery by PCR-based resequencing was estimated
at 7–11% (for the two sequencing centres), based on genotyping of each
candidate SNP in the same samples used for discovery.
The false-negative rate of SNP discovery by PCR resequencing was estimated
at 6%, using as the denominator a set of SNPs previously in dbSNP and
conﬁrmed by genotyping in the speciﬁc individuals sequenced. The false-
negative rate was considerably higher, however, for singletons (SNPs seen only
as a single heterozygote): 15% of singletons covered by high-quality sequence
data were not detected by the trace analysis, and another 25% were missed due to
a failure to obtain a high-quality sequence over the relevant base in the one
heterozygous individual (D. J. Richter et al., personal communication).
False-positive and false-negative rates in dbSNP. The false positive rate
(candidate SNPs that cannot be conﬁrmed as variable sites) estimated for
dbSNP was 17%. This represents an upper bound, because dbSNP entries that
are monomorphic in the 269 HapMap samples could be rare variants, or
polymorphic in other samples. We note that as the catalogue of dbSNP gets
deeper, the rate at which candidate SNPs are monomorphic in any given sample
is observed to rise (Supplementary Table 8). This is expected because the number
of rare SNPs and false positives scales with depth of sequencing, whereas the
number of true common variants will plateau.
SNP genotyping for the genome-wide map. Genotyping assays were designed
from dbSNP, with priority given to SNPs validated by previous genotyping data
or both alleles having been seen more than once in discovery. Data from the
Chimpanzee Genome Sequencing Project99 were used in SNP validation if they
conﬁrmed the ancestral status of a human allele seen only once in discovery
(Supplementary Information). Non-synonymous coding SNPs were also prior-
itized for genotyping. Two whole-genome, array-based genotyping reagents were
used efﬁciently to increase SNP density: 40,000 SNPs from Illumina, and 120,000
SNPs from Affymetrix100.
To monitor progress, the genome was partitioned into 5-kb bins, with
genotyping continuing through iterative rounds until a set of predetermined
‘stopping rules’ was satisﬁed in each analysis panel. (1) Minor allele frequency: in
each analysis panel a common SNP (MAF $ 0.05) was obtained in each 5-kb
bin. (2) Spacing: the distance between adjacent SNPs was 2–8 kb, with at least
9 SNPs across 50 kb. (3) ‘HapMappable’ genome: with available technologies it is
challenging to study centromeres, telomeres, gaps in genome sequence, and
segmental duplications. The project identiﬁed such regions101 (Supplementary
Table 9), spanning 4.4% of the ﬁnished human genome sequence, inwhich only a
single attempt to develop a genotyping assay was required. (4) Three strikes,
you’re out: if the above rules were not satisﬁed after three attempts to develop an
assay in a given 5-kb region, or if all available SNPs in dbSNP had been tried,
genotyping was considered complete for Phase I. Two attempts were considered
sufﬁcient if one attempt was of a SNP previously shown to have MAF $ 0.05 in
the appropriate population sample in a previous genome-wide survey77. (5)
Quality control: ongoing and standardized quality control (QC) ﬁlters and three
rounds of quality assessment (QA) were used to ensure and document the high
quality of the genotype data.
QC ﬁlters were systematically performed, with each SNP tested for complete-
ness (.80%), consistency across ﬁve duplicate genotypes (#1 discrepancy),
mendelian inheritance in 60 trios (#1 discrepancy in each of YRI and CEU), and
Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (P . 0.001102). SNPs in the Phase I data set passed
all the QC ﬁlters in all the analysis panels and were polymorphic in the HapMap
samples. Failing SNPs were released (with a special ﬂag), as they can help to
identify polymorphisms under primers, insertions/deletions, paralogous loci
and natural selection.
Three QA exercises were carried out. First, a calibration exercise to ‘bench-
mark’ each platform and laboratory protocol. Second, a mid-project evaluation
of each genotyping centre. Third, a blind analysis of a random sample of the
complete Phase I data set. A number of SNPs were genotyped more than once
during the project, or by other investigators, providing additional information
about data quality. See the Supplementary Information for full information
about the QA exercises.
An exhaustive approach was taken to mtDNA. Alignment of more than 1,000
publicly available mtDNA sequences of African (n ¼ 87), European (n ¼ 928)
and Asian (n ¼ 238) geographical origin34 was used to identify 210 common

Data release. Data deposited at the Data Coordination Center and released at
http://www.hapmap.org, a Japanese mirror site http://hapmap.jst.go.jp/ and
dbSNP include ascertainment status of each SNP at the time of selection,
primer sequences, protocols for genotyping, genotypes for each sample, allele
frequencies, and, for SNPs that failed QC ﬁlters, a code indicating the mode(s) of
failure.
Initially, because of concern that third parties might seek patents on HapMap
data, users were required to agree to a web-based ‘click-wrap license’, assenting
that they would not prevent others from using the data (http://www.hapma-
p.org/cgi-perl/registration). In December 2004 this license was dropped, and all
data were released without restriction into the public domain.
