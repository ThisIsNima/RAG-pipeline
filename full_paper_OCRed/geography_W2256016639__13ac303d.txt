Large-scale reference data sets of human genetic variation are critical for the medical and functional interpretation of 
DNA sequence changes. Here we describe the aggregation and analysis of high-quality exome (protein-coding region) 
DNA sequence data for 60,706 individuals of diverse ancestries generated as part of the Exome Aggregation Consortium 
(ExAC). This catalogue of human genetic diversity contains an average of one variant every eight bases of the exome, and 
provides direct evidence for the presence of widespread mutational recurrence. We have used this catalogue to calculate 
objective metrics of pathogenicity for sequence variants, and to identify genes subject to strong selection against various 
classes of mutation; identifying 3,230 genes with near-complete depletion of predicted protein-truncating variants, with 
72% of these genes having no currently established human disease phenotype. Finally, we demonstrate that these data 
can be used for the efficient filtering of candidate disease-causing variants, and for the discovery of human ‘knockout’ 
variants in protein-coding genes.

RESEARCH
Over the last five years, the widespread availability of high-throughput 
DNA sequencing technologies has permitted the sequencing of the 
whole genomes or exomes of hundreds of thousands of humans. In 
theory, these data represent a powerful source of information about 
the global patterns of human genetic variation, but in practice, are 
difficult to access for practical, logistical, and ethical reasons; in 
­addition, their utility is complicated by the heterogeneity in the 
­experimental methodologies and variant calling pipelines used to 
generate them. Current publicly available data sets of human DNA 
sequence ­variation contain only a small fraction of all sequenced 
­samples: the Exome Variant Server, created as part of the NHLBI 
Exome Sequencing Project (ESP)1, contains frequency information 
spanning 6,503 exomes; and the 1000 Genomes Project (1000G), which 
includes individual-level genotype data from whole-genome and exome 
sequence data for 2,504 individuals2.
Databases of genetic variation are important for our understanding 
of human population history and biology1–5, but also provide critical 
resources for the clinical interpretation of variants observed in patients 
who have rare Mendelian diseases6,7. The filtering of candidate variants 
by frequency in unselected individuals is a key step in any pipeline for 
the discovery of causal variants in Mendelian disease patients, and the 
efficacy of such filtering depends on both the size and the ancestral 
diversity of the available reference data.
Here we describe the joint variant calling and analysis of high-quality 
variant calls across 60,706 human exomes, assembled by the Exome 
Aggregation Consortium (ExAC; http://exac.broadinstitute.org). This 
call set exceeds previously available exome-wide variant databases, 
by nearly an order of magnitude, providing substantially increased 
­resolution for the analysis of very low-frequency genetic variants. We 
demonstrate the application of this data set to the analysis of patterns 
of genetic variation including the discovery of widespread mutational 
recurrence, the inference of gene-level constraint against truncating 
variation, the clinical interpretation of variation in Mendelian disease 
genes, and the discovery of human knockout variants in protein-coding 
genes.
The ExAC data set
Sequencing data processing, variant calling, quality control and ­filtering 
was performed on over 91,000 exomes (see Methods), and sample 
­filtering was performed to produce a final data set spanning 60,706 
individuals (Fig. 1a). To identify the ancestry of each ExAC individual, 
we performed principal component analysis (PCA) to distinguish the 
major axes of geographic ancestry and to identify population clusters 
corresponding to individuals of European, African, South Asian, East 
Asian, and admixed American (hereafter referred to as Latino) ancestry 
(Fig. 1b; Supplementary Table 3); we note that the apparent separation 
between East Asian and other samples reflects a deficiency of Middle 
Eastern and Central Asian samples in the data set. We further separated 
Europeans into individuals of Finnish and non-Finnish ancestry given 
the enrichment of this bottlenecked population; the term European 
hereafter refers to non-Finnish European individuals.
We identified 10,195,872 candidate sequence variants in ExAC. We 
further applied stringent depth and site/genotype quality filters to 
define a subset of 7,404,909 high-quality variants, including 317,381 
insertions or deletions (indels) (Supplementary Table 7), corresponding 
to one variant for every 8 base pairs (bp) within the exome intervals. 
The majority of these are very low-frequency variants absent from 
­previous smaller call sets (Fig. 1c), of the high-quality variants, 99% 
have a frequency of <​1%, 54% are singletons (variants seen only once 
in the data set), and 72% are absent from both 1000G and ESP data sets.
The density of variation in ExAC is not uniform across the genome, 
and the observation of variants depends on factors such as mutational 
properties and selective pressures. In the ~​45 million well-covered 
(80% of individuals with a minimum of 10×​ coverage) positions in 
ExAC, there are ~​18 million possible synonymous variants, of which 
we observe 1.4 million (7.5%). However, we observe 63.1% of possible 
CpG transitions (C to T variants, in which the adjacent base is G), while 
only observing 3% of possible transversions and 9.2% of other possible 
transitions (Supplementary Table 9). A similar pattern is observed for 
missense and nonsense variants, with lower proportions due to selective 
pressures (Fig. 1d). Of 123,629 high-quality indels called in coding 
exons, 117,242 (95%) have a length <​6 bases, with shorter deletions 
being the most common (Fig. 1e). Frameshifts are found in smaller 
numbers and are more likely to be singletons than in-frame indels 
(Fig. 1f), reflecting the influence of purifying selection.
Patterns of protein-coding variation
The density of protein-coding sequence variation in ExAC reveals a 
number of properties of human genetic variation that are undetectable 
in smaller data sets. For example, 7.9% of high-quality sites in ExAC are 
multiallelic (multiple different sequence variants observed at the same 
site), close to the Poisson expectation of 8.3%, given the observed ­density 
of variation, and far higher than that observed in previous data sets of 
0.48% in the 1000G (exome intervals) and 0.43% in the ESP data sets.
The size of ExAC makes it possible to directly observe mutational 
recurrence: instances in which the same mutation has occurred 
­multiple times independently throughout the history of the sequenced

populations. For instance, among synonymous (non-protein-­altering) 
­variants, a class of variation expected to have undergone minimal 
­selection, 43% of validated de novo events identified in external data 
sets of 1,756 parent-offspring trios8,9 are also observed independently 
in our data set (Fig. 2a), indicating a separate origin for the same variant 
within the demographic history of the two samples. This proportion 
is much higher for transition variants at CpG sites, well established 
to be the most highly mutable sites in the human genome10: 87% of 
previously reported de novo CpG transitions at synonymous sites are 
observed in ExAC, indicating that our sample sizes are beginning 
to approach saturation of this class of variation. This saturation is 
­detectable by a change in the discovery rate at subsets of the ExAC 
data set, beginning at around 20,000 individuals (Fig. 2b), indicating 
that ExAC is the first human exome-wide data set, to our knowledge, 
large enough for this effect to be directly observed.
Mutational recurrence has a marked effect on the frequency 
­spectrum in the ExAC data, resulting in a depletion of singletons 
at sites with high mutation rates (Fig. 2c). We observe a correlation 
between singleton rates (the proportion of variants seen only once in 
ExAC) and site mutability inferred from sequence context11 (r =​ −​0.98; 
P <​ 10−50; Extended Data Fig. 1d): sites with low predicted ­mutability 
have a ­singleton rate of 60%, compared to 20% for sites with the 
highest predicted rate (CpG transitions; Fig. 2c). Conversely, for 
­synonymous variants, CpG variants are approximately twice as likely 
to rise to ­intermediate frequencies: 16% of CpG variants are found 
in at least 20 copies in ExAC, compared to 8% of transversions and 
non-CpG ­transitions, suggesting that synonymous CpG transitions 
have on average two independent mutational origins in the ExAC 
­sample. Recurrence at highly mutable sites can further be observed by 
examining the population sharing of doubleton synonymous variants 
­(variants occurring in only two individuals in ExAC). Low-mutability 
­mutations (especially transversions), are more likely to be observed in 
a single population (representing a single mutational origin), whereas 
CpG transitions are more likely to be found in two separate popu-
lations (independent mutational events); as such, site mutability and 
­probability of observation in two populations is significantly correlated 
(r =​ 0.884; Fig. 2d).
We also explored the prevalence and functional impact of multinu-
cleotide polymorphisms (MNPs), in cases where multiple ­substitutions 
were observed within the same codon in at least one individual. We 
found 5,945 MNPs (mean =​ 23 per sample) in ExAC (Extended Data 
Fig. 2a), in which analysis of the underlying SNPs without correct 
­haplotype phasing would result in altered interpretation. These include 
647 instances in which the effect of a protein-truncating variant (PTV) 
is eliminated by an adjacent single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 
(referred to as a rescued PTV), and 131 instances in which underly-
ing synonymous or missense variants result in PTV MNPs (referred 
to as a gained PTV). Our analysis also revealed 8 MNPs in disease- 
associated genes, resulting in either a rescued or gained PTV, and 
10 MNPs that have previously been reported as disease-causing muta-
tions (Supplementary Tables 10 and 11). These variants would be 
missed by virtually all currently available variant calling and annotation 
pipelines.
Inferring variant deleteriousness and gene constraint
Deleterious variants are expected to have lower allele ­frequencies 
than neutral ones, due to negative selection. This theoretical 
­property has been demonstrated previously in human population 
­sequencing data12,13 and here (Fig. 1d, e). This allows inference of 
the degree of selection against specific functional classes of variation. 
However, ­mutational recurrence as described earlier indicates that 
allele ­frequencies observed in ExAC-scale samples are also skewed 
by mutation rate, with more mutable sites less likely to be single-
tons (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 1d). Mutation rate is in turn 
non-­uniformly ­distributed across functional classes. For example, 
­variants that result in the loss of a stop codon can never occur at CpG 
­dinucleotides (Extended Data Fig. 1e). We corrected for mutation rates 
(Supplementary Information section 3.2) by creating a mutability-­
adjusted proportion singleton (MAPS) metric. This metric reflects 
(as expected), strong selection against predicted PTVs, as well as 
­missense variants predicted by conservation-based methods to be 
deleterious (Fig. 2e).
The deep ascertainment of rare variation in ExAC also allows us 
to infer the extent of selection against variant categories on a per-
gene basis by examining the proportion of variation that is missing 
­compared to expectations under random mutation. Conceptually 
­similar approaches have been applied to smaller exome data sets11,14, 
but have been underpowered, particularly when analysing the ­depletion 
of PTVs. We compared the observed number of rare (minor allele 
frequency (MAF) <​0.1%) variants per gene to an expected ­number 
derived from a selection neutral, sequence-context based ­mutational 
model11. The model performs well in predicting the number of 
­synonymous variants, which should be under minimal selection, per 
gene (r =​ 0.98; Extended Data Fig. 3b).
We quantified deviation from expectation with a Z score11, which 
for synonymous variants is centred at zero, but is significantly shifted 
towards higher values (greater constraint) for both missense and PTV 
(Wilcoxon P <​ 10−50 for both; Fig. 3a). The genes on the X chromo-
some are significantly more constrained than those on the autosomes

for missense (P <​ 10−7) and loss-of-function mutations (P <​ 10−50), in 
line with previous work15. The high correlation between the observed 
and expected number of synonymous variants on the X chromosome 
(r =​ 0.97 versus 0.98 for autosomes) indicates that this difference in 
constraint is not due to a calibration issue. To reduce confounding 
by coding sequence length for PTVs, we developed an expectation-­
maximization algorithm (Supplementary Information section 4.4) 
using the observed and expected PTV counts within each gene to 
separate genes into three categories: null (observed ≈​ expected), reces-
sive (observed ≤​ 50% of expected), and haploinsufficient (observed 
<​10% of expected). This metric—the probability of being loss-of-
function (LoF) intolerant (pLI)—separates genes of sufficient length 
into LoF intolerant (pLI ≥​ 0.9, n =​ 3,230) or LoF tolerant (pLI ≤​ 0.1, 
n =​ 10,374) categories. pLI is less correlated with coding sequence 
length (r =​ 0.17 as compared to 0.57 for the PTV Z score), ­outperforms 
the PTV Z score as an intolerance metric (Supplementary Table 15), 
and reveals the expected contrast between gene lists (Fig. 3b). pLI is 
positively correlated with the number of physical interaction ­partners 
of a gene product (P <​ 10−41). The most constrained pathways (highest 
median pLI for the genes in the pathway) are core biological processes 
(spliceosome, ribosome, and proteasome components; Kolmogorov–
Smirnov test P <​ 10−6 for all), whereas olfactory receptors are among 
the least constrained pathways (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test P <​ 10−16), 
as demonstrated in Fig. 3b, and this is consistent with previous 
work5,16–19.
Crucially, we note that LoF-intolerant genes include virtually 
all known severe haploinsufficient human disease genes (Fig. 3b), 
but that 72% of LoF-intolerant genes have not yet been assigned a 
human disease phenotype despite clear evidence for extreme selective 
constraint (Supplementary Table 13). We note that this extreme 
­constraint does not necessarily reflect a lethal disease or status as a 
disease gene (for example, BRCA1 has a pLI of 0), but probably points to 
genes in which heterozygous loss of function confers some non-trivial 
survival or reproductive disadvantage.
The most highly constrained missense (top 25% missense Z scores) 
and PTV (pLI ≥​ 0.9) genes show higher expression levels and broader 
tissue expression than the least constrained genes20 (Fig. 3c). These 
most highly constrained genes are also depleted for expression 
­quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) (P <​ 10−9 for missense and PTV; Fig. 3d), 
yet are enriched within genome-wide significant trait-associated loci 
(χ​2 test, P <​ 10−14, Fig. 3e). Genes intolerant of PTV variation would be 
expected to be dosage-sensitive, as in such genes natural selection does 
not tolerate a 50% deficit in expression due to the loss of single allele. It is 
thus unsurprising that these genes are also depleted of common genetic 
variants that have a large enough effect on expression to be detected 
as eQTLs with current limited sample sizes. However, smaller changes 
in the expression of these genes, through weaker eQTLs or functional 
variants, are more likely to contribute to medically relevant phenotypes.
Finally, we investigated how these constraint metrics would stratify 
mutational classes according to their frequency spectrum, corrected 
for mutability as in the previous section (Fig. 3f). The effect was most 
dramatic when considering nonsense variants in the LoF-intolerant set 
of genes. For missense variants, the missense Z score offers ­information 
orthogonal to Polyphen2 and CADD classifications, which are 
­measures predicting the likely deleteriousness of variants, indicating 
that gene-level measures of constraint offer additional information to 
variant-level metrics in assessing potential pathogenicity.
ExAC improves variant interpretation in rare disease
We assessed the value of ExAC as a reference data set for clinical 
sequencing approaches, which typically prioritize or filter ­potentially 
deleterious variants on the basis of functional consequence and allele 
frequency6. Filtering on ExAC reduced the number of ­candidate 
­protein-altering variants by sevenfold compared to the ESP data 
set, and was most powerful when the highest allele frequency in 
any one population (‘popmax’) was used rather than the average

Figure 3 | Quantifying intolerance to functional variation in genes and 
gene sets. a, Histograms of constraint Z scores for 18,225 genes. This measure 
of departure of number of variants from expectation is normally distributed 
for synonymous variants, but right-shifted (higher constraint) for missense 
and protein-truncating variants (PTVs), indicating that more genes are 
intolerant to these classes of variation. b, The proportion of genes that are 
very probably intolerant of loss-of-function variation (pLI ≥​ 0.9) is highest for 
ClinGen haploinsufficient (HI) genes, and stratifies by the severity and age of 
onset of the haploinsufficient phenotype. Genes essential in cell culture and 
dominant disease genes are likewise enriched for intolerant genes, whereas 
recessive disease genes and olfactory receptors have fewer intolerant genes. 
Black error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. c, Synonymous Z scores 
show no correlation with the number of tissues in which a gene is expressed, 
but the most missense- and PTV-constrained genes tend to be expressed in

(‘global’) allele frequency (Fig. 4a). ESP is not well-powered to filter at 
0.1% allele ­frequency without removing many genuinely rare ­variants, 
as allele frequency estimates based on low allele counts are both 
upward-­biased and imprecise (Fig. 4b). We thus expect that ExAC will 
provide a very substantial boost in the power and accuracy of variant 
filtering in Mendelian disease projects.
Previous large-scale sequencing studies have repeatedly shown 
that some purported Mendelian disease-causing genetic variants are 
implausibly common in the population21–23 (Fig. 4c). The average 
ExAC participant harbours ~​54 variants reported as disease-causing in 
two widely used databases of disease-causing variants (Supplementary 
Information section 5.2). Most (~​41) of these are high-quality 
­genotypes but with implausibly high (>​1%) popmax allele ­frequencies. 
We therefore hypothesized that most of the supposed burden of 
Mendelian disease alleles per person is due not to genotyping error, 
but rather to misclassification in the literature and/or in databases.
We manually curated the evidence of pathogenicity for 192 
­previously reported pathogenic variants with allele frequency >​1% 
either globally or in South Asian or Latino individuals, populations that 
are ­underrepresented in previous reference databases. Nine variants 
had sufficient data to support disease association, ­typically with either 
mild or incompletely penetrant disease effects; the ­remainder either 
had insufficient evidence for pathogenicity, no claim of ­pathogenicity, 
or were benign traits (Supplementary Information ­section 5.3). It is 
difficult to prove the absence of any disease ­association, and ­incomplete 
penetrance or genetic modifiers may contribute in some cases. 
Nonetheless, the high cumulative allele frequency of these ­variants 
combined with their limited original evidence for pathogenicity 
­suggest little contribution to disease, and 163 variants met American 
College of Medical Genetics criteria24 for reclassification as benign 
or ­probably benign (Fig. 4d). A total of 126 of these 163 have been 
­reclassified in source databases as of December 2015 (Supplementary 
Table 20). Supporting functional data were reported for 18 of these 
variants, highlighting the need to review cautiously even variants with 
experimental support.
We also sought phenotypic data for a subset of ExAC participants 
homozygous for reported severe recessive disease variants, again 
­enabling reclassification of some variants as benign. North American 
Indian childhood cirrhosis is a recessive disease of cirrhotic liver failure 
during childhood requiring liver transplant for survival to adulthood, 
previously reported to be caused by CIRH1A p.R565W25 (CIRH1A is 
also known as UTP4). ExAC ontains 222 heterozygous and 4 homozy-
gous Latino individuals, with a population allele frequency of 1.92%. 
The 4 homozygotes had no history of liver disease and recontact in two 
individuals revealed normal liver function (Supplementary Table 22). 
Thus, despite the rigorous linkage and Sanger sequencing efforts that 
led to the original report of pathogenicity, the ExAC data demonstrate 
that this variant is either benign or insufficient to cause disease, high-
lighting the importance of matched reference populations.
The above curation efforts confirm the importance of allele 
­frequency filtering in analysis of candidate disease variants6,26,27. 
However, literature and database errors are prevalent even at lower 
allele frequencies: the average ExAC individual contains 0.89 (<​1% 
popmax allele frequency) reportedly Mendelian variants in well-­
characterized dominant disease genes28, and 0.21 at <​0.1% popmax 
allele frequency. This inflation probably results from a combination of 
false reports of pathogenicity and incomplete penetrance, as we have 
recently shown for PRNP29. The abundance of rare functional ­variation 
in many disease genes in ExAC is a reminder that such variants should 
not be assumed to be causal or highly penetrant without careful 
segregation or case-control analysis7,24.
Effect of rare protein-truncating variants
We investigated the distribution of PTVs, variants predicted to ­disrupt 
protein-coding genes through the introduction of a stop codon, 
frameshift, or the disruption of an essential splice site; such variants 
are expected to be enriched for complete loss of function of the affected 
genes. Naturally occurring PTVs in humans provide a model for the 
functional impact of gene inactivation, and have been used to identify 
many genes in which LoF causes severe disease30, as well as rare cases 
where LoF is protective against disease31.
Among the 7,404,909 high-quality variants in ExAC, we found 
179,774 high-confidence PTVs (as defined in Supplementary 
Information section 6), 121,309 of which are singletons. This 
­corresponds to an average of 85 heterozygous and 35 homozygous 
PTVs per individual (Fig. 5a). The diverse nature of the cohort ­enables 
the ­discovery of substantial numbers of new PTVs: out of 58,435 
PTVs with an allele count greater than one, 33,625 occur in only one 
­population. However, although PTVs as a category are extremely rare, 
the majority of the PTVs found in any one person are common, and 
each individual has only ~​2 singleton PTVs, of which 0.14 are found 
in PTV-constrained genes (pLI >​ 0.9). ExAC recapitulates known 
aspects of population demographic models, including an increase 
in ­intermediate-frequency (1–5%) PTVs in Finland32 and relatively 
­common (>​1%) PTVs in Africans (Fig. 5b). However, these differences 
are diminished when considering only LoF-constrained (pLI >​ 0.9) 
genes (Extended Data Fig. 4).

Figure 4 | Filtering for Mendelian variant discovery. a, Predicted 
missense and protein-truncating variants in 500 randomly chosen ExAC

an average of 154 variants for analysis, compared to 1,090 after filtering 
against ESP. Popmax allele frequency also provides greater power than

RESEARCH
Using a sub-sampling approach, we show that the discovery of both 
heterozygous (Fig. 5c) and homozygous (Fig. 5d) PTVs scales very 
differently across human populations, with implications for the design 
of large-scale sequencing studies to ascertain human knockouts, as 
described later.
Discussion
Here we describe the generation and analysis of the most ­comprehensive 
catalogue (to our knowledge) of human protein-coding genetic varia-
tion to date, incorporating high-quality exome sequencing data from 
60,706 individuals of diverse geographic ancestry. The resulting call set 
provides unprecedented resolution for the analysis of low-­frequency 
protein-coding variants in human populations, as well as a public 
resource (http://exac.broadinstitute.org) for the clinical ­interpretation 
of genetic variants observed in disease patients.
The very large sample size of ExAC also provides opportunities 
for a high-resolution analysis of the sensitivity of human genes to 
­functional variation. Although previous sample sizes have been 
­adequately ­powered for the assessment of gene-level intolerance to 
missense ­variation11,14, ExAC provides sufficient power for the first 
time to investigate genic intolerance to PTVs, highlighting 3,230 
highly LoF-intolerant genes, 72% of which have no established human 
­disease ­phenotype in the OMIM or ClinVar databases of observed 
human genetic mutations. Although this extreme depletion of PTVs 
will probably highlight genes in which loss of a single copy has been 
­reproductively disadvantageous over recent human history, not 
all high pLI genes will lead to lethal disease. Additionally, disease 
genes—­particularly those that act after post-reproductive age—do not 
­necessarily have high pLI values (for example, the pLI of BRCA1 is 0). 
In separate work33 we show that ExAC similarly provides power to 
identify genes intolerant of copy number variation. Quantification of 
genic intolerance to both classes of variation will provide added power 
to disease studies.
The ExAC resource provides the largest database to date (to our 
knowledge) for the estimation of allele frequency for protein-coding 
genetic variants, providing a powerful filter for analysis of candidate 
pathogenic variants in severe Mendelian diseases. Frequency data 
from ESP1 have been widely used for this purpose, but those data are 
limited by population diversity and by resolution at allele frequen-
cies ≤​ 0.1%. ExAC therefore provides substantially improved power 
for Mendelian analyses, although it is still limited in power at lower 
allele ­frequencies, emphasizing the need for more sophisticated path-
ogenic variant ­filtering strategies alongside on-going data aggregation 
efforts.
We show that different populations confer different advantages in 
the discovery of gene-disrupting PTVs, providing guidance for the 
­identification of human knockouts to understand gene function. 
Sampling multiple populations would probably be a fruitful ­strategy 
for a researcher investigating common PTV variation. However, 
­discovery of homozygous PTVs is markedly enhanced in the South 
Asian ­samples, which come primarily from a Pakistani cohort with 
38.3% of individuals self-reporting as having closely related parents, 
emphasizing the extreme value of consanguineous cohorts for human 
knockout discovery34–36 (Fig. 5d). Other approaches to enriching 
for homozygosity of rare PTVs, such as focusing on bottlenecked 
­populations, have already proved fruitful32,34.
Even with this large collection of jointly processed exomes, many 
limitations remain. First, most ExAC individuals were ascertained for 
biomedically important disease; although we have attempted to exclude 
severe paediatric diseases, the inclusion of both cases and controls 
for several polygenic disorders means that ExAC certainly contains 
disease-associated variants37. Second, future reference databases 
would benefit from including a broader sampling of human ­diversity, 
­especially from under-represented Middle Eastern and African 
­populations. Third, the inclusion of whole genomes will also be ­critical 
to investigate additional classes of functional variation and identify 
non-coding constrained regions. Finally, and most critically, detailed 
phenotype data are unavailable for the vast majority of ExAC samples; 
future initiatives that assemble sequence and clinical data from very 
large-scale cohorts will be required to fully translate human genetic 
findings into biological and clinical understanding.
Although the ExAC data set exceeds the scale of previously ­available 
frequency reference data sets, much remains to be gained by further 
increases in sample size. Indeed, the fact that even the rarest trans-
versions have mutational rates11 on the order of 1 ×​ 10−9 implies 
that the vast majority of possible non-lethal SNVs probably exist 
in some living human. ExAC already includes >​63% of all possible 
­protein-coding CpG transitions at well-covered synonymous sites; 
orders-of-­magnitude increases in sample size will eventually lead to 
saturation of other classes of variation.
ExAC was made possible by the willingness of multiple large 
disease-focused consortia to share their raw data, and by the availa-
bility of the software and computational resources required to create a 
­harmonized variant call set on the scale of tens of thousands of ­samples. 
The creation of yet larger reference variant databases will require 
­continued emphasis on the value of genomic data sharing.

Methods
Variant discovery. We assembled approximately 1 petabyte of raw sequencing 
data (FASTQ files) from 91,796 individual exomes drawn from a wide range of 
primarily disease-focused consortia (Supplementary Table 2). We processed these 
exomes through a single informatic pipeline and performed joint variant calling 
of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and indels across all samples using a new 
version of the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) HaplotypeCaller pipeline. Variant 
discovery was performed within a defined exome region that includes Gencode 
v19 coding regions and flanking 50 bases. At each site, sequence information from 
all ­individuals was used to assess the evidence for the presence of a variant in 
each individual. Full details of data processing, variant calling and resources are 
described in the Supplementary Information sections 1.1–1.4.
Quality assessment. We leveraged a variety of sources of internal and external 
validation data to calibrate filters and evaluate the quality of filtered variants 
(Supplementary Table 7). We adjusted the standard GATK variant site filtering38 
to increase the number of singleton variants that pass this filter, while maintaining a 
singleton transmission rate of 50.1%, very near the expected 50%, within sequenced 
trios. We then used the remaining passing variants to assess depth and genotype 
quality filters compared to >​10,000 samples that had been directly genotyped 
using SNP arrays (Illumina HumanExome) and achieved 97–99% heterozygous 
concordance, consistent with known error rates for rare variants in chip-based 
genotyping39. Relative to a ‘platinum standard’ genome sequenced using five 
different technologies40, we achieved sensitivity of 99.8% and false discovery rates 
(FDR) of 0.056% for single nucleotide variants (SNVs), and ­corresponding rates 
of 95.1% and 2.17% for insertions and deletions (indels), respectively. Lastly, we 
­compared 13 representative non-Finnish European exomes included in the call set 
with their corresponding 30×​ PCR-free genome. The overall SNV and indel FDR 
was 0.14% and 4.71%, respectively, while for SNV singletons it was 0.389%. The 
overall FDR by annotation classes missense, synonymous and protein ­truncating 
variants (including indels) were 0.076%, 0.055% and 0.471% respectively

(Supplementary Tables 5 and 6). Full details of quality assessments are described 
in Supplementary Information section 1.6.
Sample filtering. The 91,796 samples were filtered based on two criteria. First, 
samples that were outliers for key metrics were removed (Extended Data Fig. 5b). 
Second, in order to generate allele frequencies based on independent observations 
without enrichment of Mendelian disease alleles, we restricted the final release 
data set to unrelated adults with high-quality sequence data and without severe 
­paediatric disease. After filtering, only 60,706 samples remained, consisting of 
~​77% of Agilent (33 Mb target) and ~​12% of Illumina (37.7 Mb target) exome 
captures. Full details of the filtering process are described in Supplementary 
Information section 1.7.
ExAC data release. For each variant, summary data for genotype quality, allele 
depth and population specific allele counts were calculated before removing all 
genotype data. This variant summary file was then functionally annotated using 
variant effect predictor (VEP) with the LOFTEE plugin. This data set can be 
accessed via the ExAC Browser (http://exac.broadinstitute.org), or downloaded 
from: (ftp://ftp.broadinstitute.org/pub/ExAC_release/release0.3/ExAC.r0.3.sites.
vep.vcf.gz). Full details regarding the annotation of the ExAC data set are described 
in the Supplementary Information sections 1.9–1.10.
Data reporting. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The 
experiments were not randomized. The investigators were not blinded to allocation 
during experiments and outcome assessment.

Extended Data Figure 1 | The effect of recurrence across different 
mutation and functional classes. a, TiTv (transition to transversion)  
ratio of synonymous variants at downsampled intervals of ExAC. The 
TiTv is relatively stable at previous sample sizes (<​5,000), but changes 
drastically at larger sample sizes. b, For synonymous doubleton variants, 
mutability of each trinucleotide context is correlated with mean Euclidean 
distance of individuals that share the doubleton. Transversion (red), and 
non-CpG transition (green) doubletons are more likely to be found in 
closer PCA space (more similar ancestries) than CpG transitions (blue).  
c, The proportion singleton among various functional categories.  
The functional category stop lost has a higher singleton rate than 
nonsense. Error bars represent standard error of the mean. d, Among 
synonymous variants, mutability of each trinucleotide context is 
correlated with proportion singleton, suggesting CpG transitions (blue) 
are more likely to have multiple independent origins driving their allele 
frequency up. e, The proportion singleton metric from c, broken down by 
transversions, non-CpG transitions, and CpG variants. Notably, there is a 
wide variation in singleton rates among mutational contexts in functional 
classes, and there are no stop-lost (variants that result in the loss of a stop 
codon) CpG transitions. Error bars represent standard error of the mean.

exons divided by the sum of all expected synonymous variants. The curve 
was used to determine the appropriate depth adjustment for expected 
variant counts. For the rest of the panels, the correlation between the
