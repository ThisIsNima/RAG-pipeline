Plastics in the marine environment have become a major concern because of their
persistence at sea, and adverse consequences to marine life and potentially human health.
Implementing mitigation strategies requires an understanding and quantiﬁcation of marine
plastic sources, taking spatial and temporal variability into account. Here we present a global
model of plastic inputs from rivers into oceans based on waste management, population
density and hydrological information. Our model is calibrated against measurements available
in the literature. We estimate that between 1.15 and 2.41 million tonnes of plastic waste
currently enters the ocean every year from rivers, with over 74% of emissions occurring
between May and October. The top 20 polluting rivers, mostly located in Asia, account for
67% of the global total. The ﬁndings of this study provide baseline data for ocean plastic
mass balance exercises, and assist in prioritizing future plastic debris monitoring and
mitigation strategies.

P
lastics are increasingly used worldwide in a wide variety of
applications with global production exceeding 300 million
tonnes per year since 2014 (ref. 1). Because of their
durability, low-recycling rates, poor waste management and
maritime use, a signiﬁcant portion of the plastics produced
worldwide enters and persists in marine ecosystems2. This
includes shoreline, seabed, water column and sea surface
environments of the world’s oceans3. The release of plastics
into the marine environment occurs through a variety of
pathways, including river and atmospheric transport, beach
littering and directly at sea via aquaculture, shipping and ﬁshing
activities4. A comprehensive risk assessment of this relatively new
type of marine contamination requires deﬁning, understanding
and quantifying emissions both geographically and temporally.
This knowledge helps in reﬁning our understanding of marine
plastic pollution sources and pathways, while working towards
an estimated global budget for ocean plastics. It also assists in
identifying the critical locations and seasons of plastic releases,
supporting the implementation of cost-effective monitoring and
source mitigation efforts.
Land-based sources, as opposed to marine-based sources, are
considered the dominant input of plastics into oceans4. While
a quantiﬁcation of land-based inputs from coastal populations
(o50 km from coastline) worldwide already exists5, no global
assessment of contributions from inland populations through
riverine systems has been proposed to date. Only a few local
studies have reported levels of plastic contamination in freshwater
systems worldwide6. Such freshwater studies generally focus on
micro-plastics (o 5 mm length) contaminating sediment and
waters of lakes and rivers. Sampling design and devices, as well
as reported units (for example, pieces per m2, grams per m3) vary
substantially between different assessments7. Overall, observed
plastic concentrations differ by several orders of magnitude in
between sampled rivers7, with studies suggesting that population
density8,9, levels of urbanization and industrialization within
catchment areas10,11, rainfall rates10,12 and the presence of
artiﬁcial barriers such as weirs and dams13 play a signiﬁcant role
in resulting rates of river-based plastic inputs into the ocean.
A study in California12 was the ﬁrst to report levels of micro-
plastics in river surface waters, with sampling in Los Angeles
River, San Gabriel River and tributary Coyote Creek. The report
found substantial temporal variations in plastic contamination
levels. For a given location, the study found up to three orders of
magnitude differences between plastic concentrations measured
at different time periods. These variations were mostly explained
by events of dry and wet weather, implying that runoff plays
an important role in the transport of plastics into freshwater
systems. In recent years, more studies sampled plastic in surface
waters of rivers. In Europe, studies estimated that the Danube
River releases 530–1,500 tonnes of plastic into the Black Sea
annually8,9. Another European study estimated that 20–31 tonnes
ﬂows into the North Sea every year from the Rhine River8, with
different locations along this river demonstrating the presence of
signiﬁcant sources (for example, wastewater treatment plants,
tributaries) and sinks (for example, weirs; ref. 13). In the Italian
Po River, sampled concentrations differed by one order of
magnitude between winter and spring14, emphasising seasonality
of freshwater contamination in rivers.
Surface plastic concentrations showed a statistically signiﬁcant
correlation with human population densities and proportion
of urban development in catchments around the Chesapeake
Bay (USA)10. The study also reported the highest measured
micro-plastic concentrations (up to 1.6 milligrams per cubic
metre for 1.73 particles per cubic metre) occurring after major
rain events at three of the four monitoring sites. In South
America, monitoring from scientists and volunteers at the Elqui,
Maipo, Biobio and Maule Rivers, demonstrated a consistent
pattern
between
numerical
concentration
of
micro-plastics
(range 0.05–0.74 particles per cubic metre) and the presence of
litter deposition on riversides15. In Asia, sampling of micro-
plastics on beaches suggested that the nearby Pearl River is a
major source of plastic pollution for the region16. Surface
samplings
at
the
Chinese
Yangtze
River
mouth
showed
considerably
higher
plastic concentrations
than
any other
sampled river worldwide17 with a reported 4,137 particles per
cubic
metre.
The
signiﬁcant
differences
between
sampled
estuarine concentrations and nearshore monitoring in the area
conﬁrmed that the Yangtze River is a major regional source of
plastic input into the marine environment.
Here we provide a global estimate of river plastic inputs into
the world’s oceans, considering both the seasonality and spatial
variability of local sources. Our global model uses geospatial data
of population density18,19, rates of mismanaged plastic waste

catchment runoff21,22, as well as the presence of artiﬁcial
barriers (for example, dams and weirs) that act as particle
sinks23,24. The correlation found between model outputs and
ﬁeld observations suggests that the model presented here is
able to describe a signiﬁcant proportion of the spatio-temporal
variations on levels of plastic contamination in freshwater
systems worldwide. We predict a global annual input of
plastic from rivers into the oceans ranging from 1.15 to 2.41
million tonnes with a dominant contribution from rivers of the
Asian continent.
Results
River plastic mass inputs to oceans. We estimated that between
1.15 and 2.41 million tonnes of plastic currently ﬂows from the
global riverine system into the oceans every year (Fig. 1). The top
20 polluting rivers were mostly located in Asia (Table 1) and
accounted for more than two thirds (67%) of the global annual
input while covering 2.2% of the continental surface area and
representing 21% of the global population. Furthermore, the top
122 polluting rivers (4% of total landmass surface area and 36% of
global population) contributed for 490% of the plastic inputs
with 103 rivers located in Asia, eight in Africa, eight in South and
Central America, and one in Europe.
Our model was calibrated against reported micro- and
macro-plastic concentrations from river surface waters of Europe,
Asia, North and South America (Table 2). The studies used
for this assessment report only a fraction of the wide plastic
debris size spectrum: from particles larger than their net mesh
sizes (typically 0.3 mm) to objects smaller than the aperture
size of their sampling devices (typically 0.5 m). Therefore, our
global river plastic input estimate is conservative, as we neglect
the contribution of debris outside the sampled size range
and below the surface sampling devices. Both buoyant and
non-buoyant river plastics can be suspended throughout the
water column and transported towards the sea due to turbulent
river ﬂows and large ﬂood events25.

demonstrated
a
statistically
signiﬁcant,
positive
correlation with the product of annual MPW production rates
inside a catchment area downstream of artiﬁcial barriers and
monthly averaged catchment runoff (Pearson product-moment
test, r ¼ 0.4132, Po0.05, n ¼ 29). The correlation test was
conducted after removing measurement data from the Yangtze
River, considered as an outlier. When including data from the
Yangtze River, we logically obtained a much higher, yet biased
correlation (r ¼ 0.99, Po0.05, n ¼ 30).
The product of annual MPW production inside a catchment
area downstream of artiﬁcial barriers and monthly averaged
catchment runoff for the month corresponding to the sampling
period was used to formulate an empirical model. Uncertainties
related to estimating daily ﬂux inputs from concentration
measurements were considered, while assessing a linear regres-
sion. We determined three parametric equations corresponding
to lower, midpoint and upper model estimates to best predict
estimation ranges from observations and account for these
uncertainties (Supplementary Table 1). Our midpoint calculations
demonstrated a good relationship with mass ﬂux inputs derived
from measurements by orders of magnitude with a coefﬁcient of
determination r2 ¼ 0.93 (n ¼ 30; Fig. 2).
Estimated plastic releases from Asian rivers represented 86% of
the total global input. A considerably high-population density
combined with relatively large MPW production rates and
episodes of heavy rainfalls, resulted in this dominant contribution
from the Asian continent, with an estimated annual input of 1.21
(range 1.00–2.06) million tonnes per year. Our model predicted
that the Chinese Yangtze River is the largest contributing
catchment, with an annual input of 0.33 (range 0.31–0.48)
million tonnes of plastic discharged into the East China Sea,
followed by the Ganges River catchment, between India and
Bangladesh, with a computed input of 0.12 (range 0.10–0.17)
million tonnes per year. The combined input of the Xi, Dong and
Zhujiang Rivers in China all ﬂowing into the South China Sea at
the Pearl River delta, was estimated at 0.106 (range 0.091–0.169)

position.
Indonesia was also identiﬁed as a major contributor on the
Asian continent, with four Javanese rivers being of particular
concern. The Brantas, Solo, Serayu and Progo Rivers respectively
emitting an estimated 38,900 (range 32,300–63,700), 32,500
(range 26,500–54,100), 17,100 (range 13,300–29,900) and 12,800
(range 9,800–22,900) tonnes of plastics per year. Overall,
we computed a midpoint annual emission of 200,000 tonnes
(14.2% of global total) from Indonesian rivers and streams,
mainly coming from the Islands of Java and Sumatra. This
result reﬂects the levels of population density, as well as waste

Micro- (o 5 mm) and macro- (45 mm) plastic numerical (# m  3) and mass (g m  3) concentrations reported by observational studies. Underlined macro-plastic numerical concentrations are derived
from micro-plastic concentrations assuming a ratio of 0.04 between macro- and micro-plastic in count. This ratio is the average value from river studies reporting both size classes. As a comparison,
Eriksen et al.29 found similar macro- to micro-plastic numerical ratios for ocean particles, with values ranging from 0.01 to 0.12 (global average at 0.07). Underlined plastic mass concentrations are
derived from numerical concentrations using average particle mass at sea29: 0.003 and 0.17 g respectively for micro- and macro-plastic. Results from a sensitivity analysis on these parameters is
provided in Supplementary Table 1. Model data in the last two columns are the catchment characteristics: mismanaged plastic waste production inside the catchment (Mmpw) in t yr  1 (refs 5,20)

mismanagement in the region considering the surface area of
these catchments is two to three orders of magnitude smaller than
other large contributing rivers in the list.
The rest of the world shared the remaining 14% of river
plastic mass input, with 7.8% coming from Africa with 109,200
(range 85,700–192,000) tonnes per year, 4.8% from South
America

remaining 0.02% from the Australia-Paciﬁc region with 300
(range: 193–707) tonnes per year. In West Africa particularly, the
Cross River with 40,300 (range 33,800–65,100) tonnes per year,
the Imo River with 21,500 (range: 17,500–35,100) tonnes per year
and the Kwa Ibo River with 11,900 (range: 9,300–20,800) tonnes
per year all appeared in the list of the twenty most polluting river
catchments. In South America, we estimated an annual input of
38,900 (range 32,200–63,800) tonnes per year coming from
the Amazon River, the largest river on earth by water discharge,
with tributaries in Peru, Columbia, Ecuador and Brazil. Also in
South America, we predicted a signiﬁcant contribution from the
Magdalena River in Columbia with 16,700 (range 12,900–29,500)
tonnes per year entering the Gulf of Mexico.
Seasonality of river plastic inputs to oceans. Using monthly
averaged daily runoff for the period 2005–2014, we assessed
seasonal variations in modelled river plastic inputs into oceans
worldwide. We estimated that 474.5% of the total river plastic
input occurs between May and October. Our model showed a
peak in global inputs for the month of August with an estimated
228,800 (range 193,000–375,000) tonnes, and a low for the month
of January with 46,200 (range 34,200–87,500) tonnes. These
seasonal ﬁndings were mainly driven by the large inputs from
China which are regulated by the East Asian monsoon. In the
Asian region, opposing seasons between northern and southern
hemispheres create distinct monsoon regimes separated by the
South China Sea26, with the Indian and East Asian summer
monsoons (June to September) in the North and the South East
Asia Summer monsoon (November to March) in the south27
(Fig. 3a).
The changes in rainfall rates associated with monsoons was
reﬂected in the predicted monthly river plastic inputs into oceans.
The Yangtze River contributed a midpoint estimate of 76,000
tonnes per month in July but o2,500 tonnes per month in
January. Similarly, our model showed midpoint input estimates
from the Ganges River peaking in August with 44,500 tonnes per
month while the river discharges o150 tonnes per month
between December and March. In Southeast Asia however,
maximum river plastic inputs occurred early in the year, during
the regional rainy season. In Indonesia for example, modelled
inputs of the archipelago reached a midpoint estimate peak in
February with 35,000 tonnes per month, as opposed to 1,800
tonnes per month in August during the dry season.
Looking at seasonal inputs worldwide, it appears that the
relative variations in monthly inputs from the Asian subcontinent
are not as pronounced as for other continents (Fig. 3b). This
is caused by a balance between inputs from East Asia and the
Indian Subcontinent during the northern hemisphere summer
and contributions from Southeast Asia during the southern
hemisphere summer. For other parts of the world, our model
showed two distinct river plastic input peaks: one occurring
between June and October for African, North and Central
American rivers, and one occurring from November to May for
European, South American and Australia-Paciﬁc rivers.

year. Most of this river plastic input is coming from Asia, which
emphasise the need to focus monitoring and mitigation efforts in
Asian countries with rapid economic development and poor
waste management. Research on freshwater plastic pollution is a
relatively new ﬁeld and most efforts have been carried out in
industrialized countries of Europe and North America. While
many indicators suggest a dominant contribution of plastics from
Asian countries20, there is very little data to document these
assumptions and thoroughly verify the validity of our model.
Yet, the relatively high concentrations of ocean plastic found
at the surface of the North Paciﬁc Ocean28,29 where buoyant
plastics originating from Asia can accumulate30, suggest that our
assumptions are plausible.
It has been estimated that between 4.8 and 12.7 million tonnes
of plastic enters the ocean every year from coastal populations
worldwide5. Plastics within coastal areas however do not only
enter the oceans through rivers. It can also reach oceans by other
processes such as direct littering near beaches, followed by tidal or
wind transport4. It is also important to note that our model is
calibrated against buoyant plastics found on river surface waters,
whereas this previous coastal contribution assessment considers
all types of plastics found in municipal waste. Finally, we only
consider a section of the full plastic debris size spectrum as
particles smaller than the mesh size of the sampling nets were not
accounted for and debris larger than the aperture size of the trawl
devices are under-represented. For these reasons our estimate
should be considered conservative. Nonetheless, for comparison
purposes, we applied our model to calculate the contribution of
coastal populations (that is, living within 50 km from the
coastline) and obtained a global contribution from coastal
population of 356,000–893,000 tonnes per year. This suggests
that at least 2.8–18.6% of the coastal plastic emissions occur
via river transport. Furthermore, our ﬁndings indicate that an
additional plastic input of at least 0.79–1.52 million tonnes per
year reaches oceans from inland areas via rivers.
It should be stressed that there is a great level of uncertainty
related to both measurements and models of plastic transport in
riverine systems. Plastic sources, deposition and degradation
processes are poorly understood, and may play an important role
in the size and spatial distributions of plastic in freshwater
ecosystems31. For instance, when taking into account the
uncertainties related to the extrapolations we made in the ﬁeld
observation dataset, our global input prediction doubled from
lower to upper estimates (Supplementary Table 1). Furthermore,
a major assumption of our model is that artiﬁcial barriers such as
dams act as sinks for all plastic particles. This is a conservative
assumption since sediment trap efﬁciency of reservoirs may vary
upon several factors32.
There is a need for more extensive monitoring of freshwater
contamination by plastic pollution with systematic samplings in
sediment and surface waters of rivers throughout the year to
better understand seasonality of inputs. Methodologies and
reported units should be better standardized, as these vary
widely across assessments. Furthermore, plastics should not be
regarded as a generic material but must be classiﬁed into classes
(for example, polymer types, debris sizes). Deﬁning better
standards for monitoring plastic pollution in freshwater ecosys-
tems would allow more robust comparisons across catchments

and higher levels of sophistication of numerical models at global
scale. Long-term monitoring would improve the deﬁnition of the
sampled debris size spectrum. Studies should aim at providing
mass estimates and not only focus on reporting numbers of
particles per units of volume (or surface area). Reporting weight is
critical to assess conservative budget assessment and compare
estimates against global plastic production statistics. Finally,
depending on precipitation patterns, soil characteristics25 and
river hydrodynamics31, micro- and macro-plastic retention, as
well as vertical distribution may vary signiﬁcantly along rivers.
Similarly, to open ocean waters where empirical models using sea
surface wind velocities, sea state and particles properties have
been proposed33–35, an approach predicting plastic loads in the
water column of rivers as a function of its physical and geological
characteristics would be beneﬁcial to account for suspended
particles and reﬁne our estimates.
Here we provide a geographical and seasonal distribution of
plastic inputs from rivers into the ocean at global scale. Both our
methodology and model predictions can be reﬁned once more,
data are made available. While population density and waste
management data demonstrate a good correlation with results
from observational river studies, freshwater plastic contamination
can occur from different sources. For example, micro-plastics
retained in waste water treatment plants can be reintroduced in
the environment with application of sewage sludge on agricultural
lands36. As such, our model could include multiple source
scenarios such as land use characteristics and economic activities
to account for the inputs from the industrial and agricultural
sectors, land transportation, construction, tourism, ﬁsheries
and aquaculture industries. The modelling of local sinks for
plastics on rivers could also be reﬁned with the integration
of river morphologies and local hydrodynamics (for example,
sedimentation, remobilization), as well as the presence of natural
(for example, mangrove) and artiﬁcial (for example, river groynes
or waste water treatment plants) features. Our results are made
available in Figshare37 in an attempt to assist researchers and
policy makers with selecting locations for future monitoring and
mitigation efforts.
Methods
Model approach. Our global model computes plastic load inputs from 40,760
watersheds worldwide21 into the ocean using geospatial data on population
density18,19 and MPW production per inhabitant and per day in 182 individual
countries5,20. Waste is considered mismanaged when it is littered or inadequately
disposed. MPW corresponds to the fraction of plastic found in mismanaged waste
material on land. This deﬁnition was applied in a previous estimate of global plastic
waste inputs into the ocean from coastal population worldwide5. MPW production
rates are integrated inside catchments. The resulting mass is accumulated following
natural drainage patterns derived from local topography, and taking into account
the presence of artiﬁcial barriers (for example, dams and weirs) acting as sinks. The
seasonality of inputs at the outfall location is derived from monthly average
catchment runoff. An empirical relation using integrated MPW mass production
upstream of river mouths and seasonal runoff is formulated and calibrated using a
set of ﬁeld observations (Fig. 4).
Model formulation. To estimate daily plastic mass input from individual
watersheds, we used the following parametric equation:
Mout ¼ kMmpwR

a;
ð1Þ
where Mout is the plastic mass release at the outﬂow in kilogram per day, Mmpw, the
mass of MPW produced inside the catchment downstream of artiﬁcial barriers and
R, monthly averaged catchment runoff. k and a are the regression parameters. We
ﬁnd a strong coefﬁcient of determination (r2 ¼ 0.93) for k ¼ 1.85 10–3 and a ¼ 1.52
(midpoint estimate, Fig. 2) using n ¼ 30 records from 13 different rivers, where
data on plastic contamination in surface waters were reported in the literature.
We considered only peer-reviewed studies that provided reliable estimates
of plastic concentrations (number and/or mass of plastic particles per volume
and/or area of river water) using surface net devices. For plastic concentrations
reported in number of particles per unit area of river surface, we used the depth of
the trawling devices to convert reported surface areas (km2) into volume of water
sampled (m3). The bibliographic review and selection criteria described above led
to the consideration of seven studies in our model calibration exercise. These
studies reported river plastic concentrations in 13 rivers, at 30 sampling events that
occurred in different time periods (Table 2). Our approach is conservative because
we neglected the contribution of buoyant plastic that may occur below the sampled
depth due to water turbulence13. Furthermore, this approach does not account for
the contribution of non-buoyant plastics that, once introduced in rivers, may
slowly make its way to the oceans due to turbulent transport, accumulating in
deep sea river canyons38. Around 48% of the plastic produced yearly is made of
polymers lighter than seawater (Polyethylene and Polypropylene;1), this number is
likely higher due to existence of objects made of polymers heavier than seawater
that can ﬂoat due to air entrapment (for example, PET bottles and foamed
Polystyrene).
Not all studies considered here reported micro- and macro-plastic
concentrations at surface waters of rivers. As such, for our midpoint estimate, we
homogenized our data set using the mean ratio micro- to macro-plastic numerical
concentration from studies reporting both types (mean ratio equals to 0.04). For
comparison, a study compiling thousands of samples at sea found a relatively
similar mean ratio of 0.07 (ref. 29). When only numerical concentrations were
reported, we estimated the mass concentrations using the average mass of
micro- and macro-plastic particles sampled at sea: 0.003 and 0.17 g, respectively29.
The results of the standardization exercise are presented in Table 3.
We acknowledge however, that the extrapolations described above are a
limitation of the calibration exercise presented here, as the average mass of river
plastic particles, as well as the ratio between micro- and macro-plastic
concentrations may vary across catchments due to local differences in in-situ
fragmentation rates, plastic transport processes and levels of primary micro-plastic
emissions (for example, pre-production pellets, microbeads from cosmetics and
hygienic products, laundry powders, paint and coating ﬂakes). A sensitivity
analysis was conducted by varying the mean ratio micro- to macro-plastic
numerical concentration (range: 0.01–0.12) and the average mass of particles
(range: 0.002–0.004 g and 0.04–0.33 g for micro- and macro-plastic, respectively)
using range values found at sea29. We determined an upper and lower input
estimate using equation (1) with respectively k ¼ 1.07 10–3, a ¼ 1.61 (r2 ¼ 0.93,
n ¼ 30) and k ¼ 4.46 10  3, a ¼ 1.42 (r2 ¼ 0.91, n ¼ 30). Further details on the
sensitivity analysis are provided in Supplementary Table 1.
Correction for surface waters. Some studies8,9 directly provide an estimate of
daily or yearly plastic mass input rate. For the other studies, we computed the daily
releases of plastic from rivers into the ocean by multiplying the estimated mass
concentrations from observations by the volume of water ﬂowing at the surface
layer per day. For each river, the surface layer thickness was taken at the sampling
depth reported by the study, therefore the contribution of any particles suspended
below the sampled depth was neglected. We derived the surface layer ﬂow from the
river depth and the total monthly averaged discharge predicted by our hydrological
model using the month corresponding to the surveyed time period. When the
river depth was not reported by the study, we used the following relationship in
equation (2) between channel form and discharge39:
D ¼ cQf ;
ð2Þ
where Q is the river discharge, D is the river depth, c and f are parameters. A good
coefﬁcient of determination (r2 ¼ 0.75) was found for c ¼ 0.349 and f ¼ 0.341, when
comparing discharge and bed form of 674 rivers in Canada and USA40. When
studies reported surveys directly from estuaries, the depth was estimated using
nautical charts.
Estimating MPW mass in catchments worldwide. We combined data on waste
generation in kilograms per inhabitant and per day for 182 individual countries5,20
with gridded population densities in inhabitants per km2 (refs 18,19) to estimate
inland MPW production rates per year. An exception was made for Sri Lanka,
where we replaced the World Bank statistics with values reported in more detailed
regional assessments41,42. We computed a global 1
4 degree resolution grid of
estimated mass of MPW generation on land in tonnes per year. In this model, we
assumed that inland plastic is accumulated by following natural drainage patterns,
derived from the space borne elevation data22. The global landmass surface area
was divided in river catchments from the U.S. Geological Survey Agency that are
used by the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS, ref. 21). We used the
ﬂow accumulation toolset from ESRI’s ArcGIS software to compute the total mass
of inland MPW upstream of the outﬂow location. The outﬂow is the most
downstream position in a river catchment and determines the input source point
into the ocean. Input from catchments with an outﬂow not connected to the ocean
(for example, speciﬁcally arid inland areas) were discarded. The model takes into
account the presence of artiﬁcial barriers and treats them as accumulation sinks,
where plastic at the surface is intercepted. As a result, the predicted plastic
concentration at the river mouth is representative of the accumulation of inland
MPW (in tonnes per year) in the catchment area downstream of artiﬁcial dams.
The consideration of dams in our numerical model was motivated by a better
correlation found with measurements (Table 4) than when including MPW
production rates upstream of dams. Artiﬁcial barriers in rivers may retain 65% of
the global input into freshwater, as we calculated an annual 2.13–4.46 million
tonnes of plastic introduced upstream of dams that are not accounted as input into

the oceans by our model. These results were calculated using the parametric
equation determined when considering MPW downstream of dams as model
proxy. Including MPW production upstream of dams, when assessing the linear
regression would result in different model parameters k and a in equation (1).
While determining regression coefﬁcients based on MPW quantities upstream of
dams, our model predicted a global input of 0.76–1.55 million tonnes per year
(midpoint at 0.91 million tonnes per year) which remains in the same order of
magnitude than the initial scenario. The decrease in predicted global input from
the current model may be explained by the number of dams present in the large
rivers covered by the observational studies. In the Yangtze River and Danube River
catchments particularly, respectively 68% and 78% of MPW production occurs
upstream of a dam. Therefore, relative MPW mass have less weight on the overall
prediction result which ultimately leads in a decrease of our global estimate.
Dam locations were derived from the United Nation Food and Agriculture
Organization’s AquaStat dam database23, consisting of 8,800 dams worldwide with a
minimum height of 15 m or a reservoir capacity of 43 million m3. The Global Rivers
and Dam Database (GRanD database; ref. 24) was used for South America as the
AquaStat database was incomplete for this continent. The catchments containing the
largest number of dams were the basins of the Mississippi River (718 dams), Yangtze
River (342 dams) and Danube River (184 dams). As the analysis is based on natural
drainage patterns, the model limitations are that man-made channels are not taken
into account and that plastic load accumulates in the main arms of rivers at deltas,
introducing uncertainties at local scales. These limitations however do not affect the
global inputs estimate. An example for the island of Java in Indonesia illustrating the
different datasets involved in this framework is provided in Fig. 5.
Estimating monthly averaged catchment runoff. In our model, surface runoff is
included as a model parameter to account for (1) the introduction of MPW in
riverine system during episodes of heavy rainfall10 and (2) the remobilization of
deposited plastic particles during ﬂood events31. Monthly averaged catchment
runoff in millimetres per day was calculated using GLDAS driving the NOAH Land
Surface Model21. This land surface modelling system integrates data from advanced
ground and space-based observation systems. The model contains land surface
parameters for vegetation, soil, elevation and slope. The forcing data in the
model are near-real-time satellite-derived precipitation and evaporation data
(wind, radiation, temperature, humidity and surface pressure). The model
computes the daily surface and subsurface runoff globally on 1
4 degree resolution, by
solving terrestrial water and energy budgets21. Subsurface runoff consists of water
that inﬁltrates into the soil and ﬂows to a water body by groundwater ﬂow. Surface
runoff occurs either when the rainfall exceeds the inﬁltration capacity of the soil or
when the soil is saturated with groundwater. Monthly and yearly averages are
calculated over the period 2005–2015. The surface and subsurface runoff are
summed and subsequently averaged per catchment area22. A better correlation was
found with estimated ﬂux inputs from observational studies when considering
monthly averaged runoff instead of the yearly average (Table 4). Therefore,
monthly averaged catchment runoff corresponding to sampling event month was
considered while calibrating our model to account for temporal variations and
seasonality of inputs.
The main motivation behind using runoff data from GLDAS is the provision
of land surface processes including runoff estimates at a global level. Nonetheless,
it is important to notice that comparisons between river discharge predictions from
GLDAS and observations in 66 basins worldwide43 demonstrated that predictions
are somewhat dryer than observations. The authors of this validation study
attributed the differences to uncertainties in precipitation rates. As our framework
relies on intra-annual variability, the NOAH land surface model predictions, forced
with GLDAS, were still in good agreement with seasonal variations measurements
with a predicted date of maximum discharge within 20 days of observed annual
discharge peak date for most rivers covered in the GLDAS validation study.

Mismanaged plastic waste production inside a catchment (Mmpw) is expressed in t yr  1 (with and without the consideration of dams), monthly averaged and yearly averaged catchment runoff (Rmonth
and Ryear) in mm d  1. Correlation coefﬁcients (r) are positive for all characteristics. Pairs with P values below 0.05 are statistically signiﬁcant (shown in bold). Weight concentrations (n ¼ 30)
demonstrated an excellent correlation with Mmpw with r coefﬁcient near 1 and P values near 0, however this result may be biased by the inclusion of measurements from the Yangtze River which may be
seen as an outlier with at least three orders of magnitudes difference with the rest of reported concentrations. When removing outliers, the best correlation is found with the product of monthly averaged
catchment runoff Rmonth and Mmpw downstream of dams (statistically signiﬁcant positive correlation, n ¼ 29, r ¼ 0.4132 and P ¼ 0.026 o0.05).
