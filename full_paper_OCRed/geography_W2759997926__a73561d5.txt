Key points: 
30 
• 
Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) has gained clinical recognition as one of the most 
31 
important causes of liver disease worldwide both in adults and children as a consequence of the 
32 
pandemic spread of obesity, though some patients are lean. 
33 
• 
The global prevalence of NAFLD in the general population is currently estimated to be 24%, but the 
34 
highest rates are reported from South America and the Middle East, followed by Asia, United States 
35 
and Europe, whereas NAFLD is less common in Africa. 
36 
• 
What clearly sets NAFLD apart from other common liver diseases is the sheer volume of patients. In 
37 
this context, the major focus of clinical care is discerning NAFLD subjects at highest risk for 
38 
progressive liver disease  
39 
• 
Being overweight in childhood/late adolescence is associated with an increased risk of liver disease 
40 
due to NAFLD later in life. As a consequence, the threshold of liver-related morbidity and/or 
41 
mortality is reached at a younger age.  
42 
• 
NAFLD subjects have a high risk of liver-related morbidity/mortality along with metabolic 
43 
comorbidities and may place a growing strain on health systems from their need for management.  
44 
• 
NAFLD is a complex disease, affected by inter-related environmental factors and genetic 
45 
predisposition which varies in different regions of the world. Knowledge of the exact contribution 
46 
of each of the genetic or environmental components in promoting the burden of NAFLD should be 
47 
a priority in the research agenda. 
48 
• 
While waiting for effective therapies, NAFLD warrants the attention of primary care physicians, 
49 
specialists and health policy makers, starting from prevention of excessive weight gain during 
50 
childhood.

Abstract 
54 
NAFLD is one of the most important causes of liver disease worldwide and is likely to emerge as the leading 
55 
cause of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) in the coming decades, with the disease affecting both adults and 
56 
children. The epidemiology and demographic characteristics of NAFLD vary worldwide, usually parallel to 
57 
the prevalence of obesity, but a significant proportion of patients are lean. The large number of NAFLD 
58 
patients with potential for progressive liver disease creates challenges for screening, as the diagnosis of 
59 
NASH necessitates invasive liver biopsy. Furthermore, NAFLD subjects have a high frequency of metabolic 
60 
comorbidities and may place a growing strain on health systems from their need for management. While 
61 
waiting for effective therapies, this liver disease warrants the attention of primary care physicians, 
62 
specialists and health policy makers.

Introduction  
66 
During the last century, dramatic modifications in lifestyle have radically changed the health priorities in 
67 
most areas of the world. The new epidemic in chronic liver disease is related to the burden of Nonalcoholic 
68 
fatty liver disease (NAFLD), paralleling the worldwide increase of obesity. The global prevalence of NAFLD is 
69 
currently estimated to be 24%.1 Community surveys utilizing ultrasonography or proton NMR spectroscopy 
70 
have assessed the prevalence of NAFLD across geographic locales (Figure 1), while studies based on 
71 
elevated liver enzymes systematically underestimated the true prevalence. NAFLD is highly prevalent in all 
72 
continents, but the highest rates are reported from South America (31%) and the Middle East (32%), 
73 
followed by Asia (27%), United States (24%) and Europe (23%), whereas NAFLD is less common in Africa 
74 
(14%).1 
75 
NAFLD, particularly its histological phenotype nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), can potentially progress 
76 
to advanced liver disease, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).2 The prevalence of NAFLD is 
77 
constantly increasing (15% in 2005 to 25% in 2010) and similarly the rate of NASH is almost doubled in the 
78 
most recent studies compared to the oldest ones (59.1% versus 33%).1 NASH is now considered the second 
79 
most common indication for liver transplant in the United States after chronic hepatitis C and is still 
80 
growing.2 This review will provide evidence of the global burden of NAFLD and its clinical and economic 
81 
implications, which should be considered by health policies to secure a better future for coming 
82 
generations.

Prevalence of NAFLD in the United States of America  
86 
Over the recent decades, there has been extensive research to accurately determine the prevalence of 
87 
NAFLD in the United States.3-10 These data have recently been summarized in a meta-analysis reporting the 
88 
worldwide prevalence of NAFLD.1 In most of these studies, the prevalence of NAFLD in the general 
89 
population was determined by imaging or other indirect methods. In this context, the prevalence of NAFLD 
90 
in the United States diagnosed by ultrasound was estimated to be 24.13% [95% CI: 19.73-29.15]. On the 
91 
other hand, the prevalence of NAFLD as determined by any other non-invasive methods (blood tests, ICD 9 
92 
or ICD 10 coding) was reported to be about 21.09% [95% 15.03-28.8], suggesting that diagnosis of NAFLD 
93 
that is solely based on the blood testing or ICD coding can lead to under-reporting of its true prevalence.1 
94 
In the United States, the prevalence of NAFLD can vary by the ethnicity. In this context, the prevalence of 
95 
NAFLD is reported to be highest in the Hispanic Americans, followed by Americans of European descent 
96 
followed by African Americans.3-11 Although still not fully resolved, a number of factors may explain these 
97 
reported ethnic disparities in the prevalence of NAFLD in the United States. These include genetic factors, 
98 
environmental factors, access to health care, and presence of chronic diseases such as metabolic 
99 
syndrome.1,6-8  
100 
This issue is elucidated by the lower prevalence of NAFLD among African American than the Hispanic 
101 
Americans.5,8 This is especially surprising because of the higher prevalence of obesity and hypertension in 
102 
African American subjects. 5,8  
103 
In contrast, a study using the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988-1994) data 
104 
reported that metabolic syndrome was the primary driver of NAFLD among the non-Hispanic Blacks and the 
105 
Mexican Americans, but not for the White Americans. Despite some contradictory data regarding the 
106 
interaction of NAFLD and components of metabolic syndrome in African Americans, this study suggests that 
107 
the association of metabolic syndrome with NAFLD may be influenced by ethnicity.12 
108

In another study using data from Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network (NASH CRN), 
109 
investigators compared Latino subjects with NASH to non-Latino White subjects with NASH.13 The study 
110 
found that Latinos with NASH were younger, had less physical activity, but higher carbohydrate intake. 
111 
Furthermore, they reported that the effect of HOMA-IR on the risk of NASH was modified by ethnicity. In 
112 
this context, HOMA-IR was not a significant risk factor for NASH among Latinos (odds ratio [OR] = 0.93; 95% 
113 
confidence interval [CI]: 0.85-1.02), but was an important risk among non-Latino whites with NASH (OR, 
114 
1.06; 95% CI: 1.01-1.11). These data confirm that factors associated with NAFLD can be influenced by ethnic 
115 
background of the patient.13  
116 
It is also important to recognize that even within a certain ethnic group in the United States; there may be 
117 
differences in the prevalence of NAFLD. In fact, the prevalence of NAFLD among the Hispanic Americans can 
118 
vary according to the country of origin.8,14,15 In one such study, investigators compared the prevalence rates 
119 
of NAFLD subjects between Hispanics of Mexican origin and Hispanics of Dominican and Puerto Rican 
120 
origins (Caribbean area). Using data from the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort, the 
121 
overall Hispanic prevalence of NAFLD was 29%.14 On the other hand, Hispanics of Mexican origin had a 
122 
significantly higher prevalence of NAFLD at 33% while Hispanics of Dominican origin had a prevalence rate 
123 
of only 16% and Hispanics of Puerto Rican origin had a prevalence rate of 18%. After multivariate analysis, 
124 
Hispanics of Mexican origin continued to remain at higher risk of having NAFLD than the individuals of 
125 
Dominican and Puerto Rican origin.14  
126 
Although the ethnic and country of origin data regarding the prevalence of NAFLD is interesting, the exact 
127 
explanation for these ethnic differences remains unknown. Some of these differences can be explained by 
128 
the genetic factors that are described later in this review (nature) while others can be explained by 
129 
environmental factors (nurture), such as diet, exercise and alcohol consumption.  
130 
Finally, the prevalence of the progressive form of NAFLD or NASH in the general population remains 
131 
unknown. Nevertheless, there are indirect estimates for these rates by calculating prevalence of NASH in 
132 
NAFLD and prevalence of NAFLD in the general population. In this context, the prevalence of NASH among 
133

----- Page 9 (native) -----
8 
 
subjects with NAFLD in the United States is reported to be 21% (95% CI: 19.85%- 22.95%].1 Using this rate, 
134 
prevalence of NASH in the US population is estimated to be around 3-4%.1 The corresponding prevalence 
135 
rates of the comorbid conditions associated with NASH have been reported to be obesity 82%, type 2 
136 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) 48%, hyperlipidemia 82%, metabolic syndrome 76%, and hypertension 70%.1 
137 
 
138 
Prevalence of NAFLD in South America 
139 
The prevalence rate of NAFLD in South America seems to be higher than the rate reported for the United 
140 
States. Specifically, NAFLD prevalence (using ultrasound) for South America has been estimated to be 
141 
around 30.45% [95% CI: 22.74-39.4].1 The majority of studies reporting the prevalence of NAFLD from 
142 
South America have been performed in Brazil.15-17 Nevertheless, in a study reported from Chile, the 
143 
prevalence of NAFLD (using ultrasound) was estimated to be 23%.18 Another study from Columbia also 
144 
using ultrasound, reported a prevalence rate of 26.6% in male subjects.19 Furthermore, the same 
145 
investigators have estimated that the prevalence of “probable NAFLD” based on the rates of obesity in 
146 
Peru, Argentina, Ecuador, Paraguay, and Uruguay could be as low as 13% (Peru) to as high as 24% 
147 
(Uruguay).19 Although there are estimates for the prevalence of NAFLD in South America, the data on the 
148 
prevalence of NASH is even more scarce. Nevertheless, in one study, 61% of the patients with NAFLD in 
149 
South America were found to have NASH which could make the prevalence of NASH from 6% to 18%.20 
150 
These rates again can be influenced by genetic predisposition, as described later. 
151 
In summary, NAFLD prevalence rates do differ by ethnicity within the United States.1,18-21 The Hispanic 
152 
population has the highest prevalence while African Americans are reported to have the lowest prevalence, 
153 
despite having higher prevalence rates of hypertension and obesity, both NAFLD risk factors. There are also 
154 
ethnic differences noted within South America as well with Brazil reporting the highest prevalent rate and 
155 
Peru the lowest.

Incidence of NAFLD and Future Projections the United States and in South America 
158 
Longitudinal studies of the general population are lacking in both the United States and South America. As a 
159 
result, there is no true population-based incidence rates reported NAFLD. However, Kanwal and colleagues 
160 
have suggested that the annual incidence of NAFLD within the USA should generally be stable at 2.2% to 
161 
3.2%.10 On the other hand, we know that NAFLD is highly associated with several metabolic conditions 
162 
[type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), obesity, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia].22,23 
163 
Therefore, it is expected that the incidence of NAFLD should rise in parallel to the increasing incidence of 
164 
obesity and T2DM.24 In addition to the data about the true incidence rates for NAFLD, it is also important to 
165 
determine the long -outcomes of patients with NAFLD. In this context, developing algorithms to define 
166 
which patients with NAFLD will develop the progressive form of NASH, cirrhosis, liver-related mortality or 
167 
cardiovascular mortality will be of great importance.

Epidemiology of NAFLD in Europe  
171 
In Europe a North-to-South gradient has been described for most chronic viral or non-viral hepatitis, but 
172 
this does not hold true for NAFLD. Rather, the globalization of NAFLD runs parallel to the prevalence rates 
173 
of obesity and varies accordingly, with degree of hepatic triglyceride accumulation being directly 
174 
proportional to the severity of each element of the metabolic syndrome.25 Although prevalence varies 
175 
according to the modality used to detect NAFLD, approximately a quarter of the European population is 
176 
affected by this liver disease. A recent meta-analysis reported an average prevalence of 23.71% in Europe, 
177 
with variations ranging from 5% to 44% in different countries.1 
178 
Data from the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP) cohort in North-eastern Germany, estimates the 
179 
prevalence of NAFLD to be around 30% when diagnosed by ultrasound.26 A UK-based community study 
180 
determined that NAFLD was the most common aetiology for asymptomatic abnormal liver biochemistry, 
181 
accounting for 26.4% of cases (of whom 7.6% were predicted to have advanced liver disease).27 Similarly, a 
182 
French series of liver biopsies in subjects with unexplained abnormal liver tests reported simple steatosis in 
183 
26.8% of cases, of whom 32.7% had NASH.28 In the Dyonisos Study, the prevalence of NAFLD assessed by 
184 
ultrasound in Northern Italy was similar in subjects with and without suspected liver disease (25 vs. 20%, P 
185 
=0.203), defined as altered liver enzymes or positivity of HBsAg and/or anti-HCV. Notably, only 54% of 
186 
NAFLD cases occurred in patients with elevated ALT,29 but the vast majority of them had many features of 
187 
the metabolic syndrome. Epidemiological data from Spain describe similar rates, with a NAFLD prevalence 
188 
of 25.8% in the adult population.30 Only few studies are available from Eastern Europe. In Romania, NAFLD 
189 
assessed by ultrasound has been found in 20% of 3005 hospitalized patients without liver disease,31 while a 
190 
study on healthy Hungarian adult confirmed a 22.6% overall prevalence of sonographically detected fatty 
191 
liver.32  
192 
As expected, the prevalence of NAFLD increases substantially in “at-risk” groups such as patients with type 
193 
2 diabetes (T2DM).2 The two major available studies, conducted on a large cohort of Italian patients with 
194 
T2DM, reported NAFLD prevalence rates of 60–70%,33,34 while UK data suggests that ultrasound detected 
195

----- Page 12 (native) -----
11 
 
NAFLD is present in 42.6% of patients with T2DM.35 Similarly, prevalence increases with body mass index 
196 
(BMI) so that 91% of obese patients (BMI ≥30 kg/m2), 67% of overweight (BMI 25-30 kg/m2) and 25% in 
197 
normal weight individuals had ultrasound evidence of NAFLD in an unselected Italian population sample. 36 
198 
The prevalence of NAFLD among subjects matching at least one of the ATP III criteria for lipid alterations is 
199 
similarly high (78.8 %).33 
200 
Data regarding the prevalence of advanced forms of NAFLD and NASH in the general population is more 
201 
limited. A community-based study from the Netherlands using a transient elastography reading of ≥8kPa 
202 
for the diagnosis of liver fibrosis, estimated that clinically significant fibrosis was present in 5.6% (169/3041) 
203 
of total subjects and 8.4% (69/822) of those with NAFLD, and was positively associated with steatosis and 
204 
T2DM.37 In this respect, the influence of T2DM on risk of progressive NAFLD is supported by a UK-based 
205 
paired-biopsy study that showed incident T2DM to be the strongest predictor of progressive disease.38 A 
206 
Greek post-mortem study from 498 cases of ischaemic heart disease or traffic accident deaths revealed 
207 
simple steatosis in 31.3% and NASH in 39.8% of cases.39 In a recent study performed on Spanish patients 
208 
with gallstone disease scheduled for cholecystectomy, 51.6% of them had histological evidence of NAFLD 
209 
and 19.8% of NASH.40 Of note, in this cohort ultrasonography confirmed a fatty liver in only 67.6% of the 
210 
histologically diagnosed NAFLD subjects. Similar data are reported in healthy people evaluated in 
211 
Transplant Units as potential living liver donors. In a single retrospective study performed in a mixed 
212 
American and Italian cohort, the histological prevalence of steatosis was 48.5%, including a 15.5% of 
213 
steatohepatitis.41 However, both NAFLD and NASH were more frequently found in Americans compared 
214 
with Italians (54% vs 34% for NAFLD and 17.6% vs 16.2% for NASH, respectively). The rates of NASH are 
215 
clearly increased in patients referred to tertiary centers for NAFLD. In a recent meta-analysis the pooled 
216 
NASH prevalence in Europe among NAFLD patients with an indication for biopsy was 69.25% (95% CI: 
217 
55.93-79.98).1  
218 
Incidence of NAFLD and future projections in Europe 
219

----- Page 13 (native) -----
12 
 
Only a small number of studies explored the incidence of NAFLD in the general population. Over a follow up 
220 
of 8.5 years, the incidence of ultrasound detected NAFLD was 18.5 per 1,000 person-years in a sample 
221 
representative of the general Italian population.36 On the contrary, recent data are clarifying the natural 
222 
history of histologically diagnosed NAFLD. In a Swedish cohort of 229 biopsy-proven NAFLD patients with a 
223 
mean longitudinal follow-up of 26.4±5.6 years, compared to a matched reference population sample, 
224 
NAFLD patients had significantly increased all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.29, 95%CI 1.04-1.59), 
225 
exhibited an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (HR 1.55, 95%CI 1.11-2.15), hepatocellular carcinoma 
226 
(HR 6.55, 95%CI 2.14-20.03) and cirrhosis (HR 3.2, 95%CI 1.05-9.81).42 The presence of fibrosis was found to 
227 
be the strongest prognostic factor for liver-related events and mortality.42 Consistent with this, the burden 
228 
of NAFLD-related hepatocellular carcinoma is also increasing dramatically. A study from North East England 
229 
found that NAFLD associated HCC accounted for 35% of all cases (41/118) in 2010, representing a >10-fold 
230 
increase in 10 years.43 Finally, results from the UK NHS Blood and Transplant Agency show that 
231 
decompensated NASH cirrhosis accounted for an increased proportion of patients undergoing liver 
232 
transplant (12% in 2013 compared with 4% in 1995).44

Epidemiology of NAFLD in the Asia-Pacific and Africa 
236 
Within the Asia-Pacific Region, NAFLD prevalence varies widely as would be expected from a region of at 
237 
least 55 countries with marked disparities in rates of development within the economic, political and 
238 
educational spheres, and tied to this, variations in nutrition, lifestyle and sedentary behaviour. Further, 
239 
there is a bias towards reporting studies that emanate from more affluent economics in the region with 
240 
better health systems. Unlike from Europe and North America, data from the Asia Pacific and Africa is not 
241 
as comprehensive both between and within countries and there is a total absence of this information from 
242 
many countries.  
243 
Though there are no nationwide epidemiological surveys that include an assessment of liver fat, even 
244 
within a single country such as China, there are striking differences according to region and over time in the 
245 
prevalence of NAFLD. As an example, NAFLD prevalence in the populations of Chengdu (Southwest China), 
246 
Shanghai (East China), Guangdong (South China) and central China were 12.5%, 15%, 17% and 24.5%, 
247 
respectively.45-47 On the other hand, a more recent ultrasound based study of 7152 employees from 
248 
Shanghai suggested that NAFLD prevalence was as high as 38.17%.48 In Hong Kong, a community-based 
249 
study employing state of the art proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopy to quantify liver fat estimated a 
250 
NAFLD prevalence of 28.8%; 19.3% in non-obese subjects and 60.5% among the obese.49 Similarly in 
251 
Taiwan, the prevalence of NAFLD was reported to be 11.4% in the general community 50 but higher in 
252 
certain sub-populations including the elderly (50.1%) 51 and in those with a typically inactive lifestyle (66.4% 
253 
in Taxi drivers).52 
254 
In the Far East, the community prevalence of NAFLD was ~25% in Japan, increasing from 12.6% before 1990 
255 
to 30.3% in 1998.53 More recent reports suggest that 23-26% of subjects undergoing routine health 
256 
screening have fatty liver by abdominal ultrasonography.54 Using similar methodology, the reported 
257 
prevalence of NAFLD in Korea in 141,610 subjects was 27.3%.55  
258 
South Asia and the Indian sub-continent are currently in the throes of rapid economic and social change, 
259 
with trends towards urbanization and an urban/rural economic divide. Not unexpectedly, in rural India, a 
260

----- Page 15 (native) -----
14 
 
region characterized by traditional diets and lifestyles, the prevalence of NAFLD is remarkably low (~9%), 
261 
while it mimics western prevalence rates in urban populations, with rates varying between 16% and 32%.56-
262 
58 A similar dramatic variation in NAFLD prevalence (5-30%) was observed from smaller surveys in Sri Lanka 
263 
Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia.59-62 
264 
Overall, while NAFLD prevalence rates are varied but increasing across Asia, given that this region is subject 
265 
to the same global forces of change towards energy dense food consumption and reduced physical activity, 
266 
NAFLD rates between the East and West are more similar than different, in the context of a similar 
267 
obesogenic environment. 
268 
The scanty available data on the prevalence of NAFLD in Africa suggests that Africans tend to have lower 
269 
prevalence, consistent with what has been reported in African Americans. In Nigeria, prevalence between 
270 
9.5%-16.7% in diabetics and 1.2%-4.5% in non-diabetics has been reported.63,64 Similarly, in South Africa, 
271 
the prevalence in obese and overweight was 45-50%.65 A recent small population based study suggested a 
272 
prevalence of 20% in the Sudanese population.66

Lean NAFLD  
277 
Initially described in Asian populations, NAFLD in the absence of obesity, i.e., the so-called ‘lean’ NAFLD, 
278 
can develop in around 10%-20% of non-obese Americans and Caucasians 5,67 (Figure 2 and Supplementary 
279 
Tables A and B)45,49,50,56,67-78. It deserves clinical attention as many physicians have a perception that lean 
280 
NAFLD is more “benign” in nature. Lean NAFLD encompasses a heterogeneous spectrum of disease arising 
281 
from different aetiologies, as listed in Table 1. Visceral obesity as opposed to general obesity, high fructose 
282 
and high fat intake and genetic risk factors, including congenital defects of metabolism, may be associated 
283 
with lean NAFLD. It is likely that a vast bulk of lean NAFLD cases belong to the phenotype of “metabolically 
284 
obese normal weight” subjects,79 described in at least 5% of the occidental population. It consists of a 
285 
subgroup of non-obese, frequently sedentary subjects who display altered insulin sensitivity, increased 
286 
cardiovascular risk and increased liver lipid, the consequence of decreased capacity for storing fat and 
287 
reduced mitochondrial function in adipose tissue and increased de novo lipogenesis in liver.79 When 
288 
compared to overweight-obese NAFLD patients, lean NAFLD subjects are younger and have a lower 
289 
prevalence of MetS (2%-48% versus 22-64% in overweight-obese).67,80 However, these patients are usually 
290 
insulin-resistant and have higher plasma triglycerides when compared to matched controls without 
291 
NAFLD.74,80 In a cohort of non-obese, non-diabetic subjects with biopsy-proven NAFLD, the metabolic 
292 
pattern was similar to that observed in obesity, with adipose tissue IR playing an important role.81  
293 
Since lean NAFLD is usually present with less obesity-related comorbidities, it is commonly believed that 
294 
this group would follow a relatively benign clinical course. Within the cohort of the National Health and 
295 
Nutrition Examination Survey III (NHANES III),79 mortality of metabolically-normal NAFLD patients was 
296 
similar to the cohort without liver disease. Unfortunately, most reports are limited by the use of imaging 
297 
modalities rather than liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of fatty liver.5,74,79-84 In an Italian study 82 
298 
including 430 biopsy proven NAFLD, 55% of patients without visceral obesity had NASH and fibrosis ≥ F2 
299 
despite milder metabolic alterations. In a recent study 83 similar proportions of obese and non-obese 
300

----- Page 17 (native) -----
16 
 
patients had NASH (51.9% versus 43.5%, P = 0.217), although the latter group had a lower degree of 
301 
steatosis and hepatocyte ballooning. Consistent with earlier reports 79, the proportion of patients with 
302 
advanced fibrosis at baseline was not different between obese and non-obese subjects, suggesting that 
303 
once an individual declares him or herself as having NASH, obesity may not be the main driver of fibrosis 
304 
progression. Genetic factors might be involved in lean NAFLD, however the presence of NASH in these 
305 
subjects was not explained by mutations able to influence either IR (ENPP1 and IRS-1 polymorphisms) or 
306 
the severity of steatosis (PNPLA3 and TM6SF2 polymorphisms).82 
307 
The longitudinal risk of mortality in lean NAFLD has been scarcely explored. In the above-mentioned study, 
308 
82 after a median follow-up of 49 months, clinical events occurred in 11.9% of obese patients and 8.3% of 
309 
nonobese patients (P = 0.190). Cardiovascular events accounted for about two thirds of all major events in 
310 
both groups. All deaths (n=6) occurred in the obese group, but definitive conclusions are difficult to make 
311 
as follow-up was relatively short. An international cohort study including 483 cases with a mean follow-up 
312 
period of over 11 year 85, published so far in abstract form, challenged the concept that the prognosis of 
313 
patients with NAFLD who have normal BMI is benign. Despite presenting with a healthier metabolic profile 
314 
and less advanced liver fibrosis, median survival free of liver transplantation was significantly shorter in 
315 
lean than in non-lean patients (18.1 vs. 26.6 years, respectively, p<0.001).  
316 
The final question is how to manage lean subjects diagnosed with NAFLD, given that it might be harder to 
317 
correct the underlying risk factors. Careful identification and correction of environmental causes, such as 
318 
significant fructose consumption, may be effective particularly in young patients. Weight loss remains the 
319 
background therapy in all cases with overweight/obesity, but in lean NAFLD patients habitual physical 
320 
activity should also be emphasized. A call for more studies to understand the natural history of the disease 
321 
but also for greater awareness among practitioners about the potential health risks associated with lean 
322 
NAFLD is urgently needed.

The future impact of pediatric NAFLD 
331 
Obesity in children has risen from 5.0% in 1960 to 16.9% in 2009-2010.86 The obesity-related risk of future 
332 
liver disease is alarming, as a weight gain during school-years carries a higher risk of NAFLD than weight-
333 
gain in late adulthood. In a large longitudinal Danish study,87 a weight increase during childhood and early 
334 
adolescence was related to all histological features of adult NAFLD even after adjusting for initial as well as 
335 
attained BMI. Among children with similar attained BMIs at 13 years of age, the risk of cirrhosis in 
336 
adulthood was increased by 16% per each unit gain in BMI z-score at every age from 7 through 13 years.87 
337 
Similarly, also a weight gain during late adolescence is able to induce an increased susceptibility of 
338 
developing NAFLD later in life. Another study tested the association of basal BMI on the development of 
339 
End-Stage-Liver-Disease (ESLD) or liver-related death in a general population cohort of 44,248 men aged 
340 
18-20 years that attended military service in Sweden between 1969 and 1970.88 After a follow-up of almost 
341 
38 years, being overweight in late adolescence increased the risk of liver-related outcomes by 64% 
342 
compared with a low–normal range BMI, with a 5% increased risk for each unit of BMI above normal 
343 
range.88 Obesity early in life also increases the adulthood risk of HCC. Another Danish study including 
344 
schoolchildren 7 through 13 years old 89 showed that each unit increase in BMI z-score increased by 20–
345 
30% the risk of liver cancer 30 years later. In other words, compared with an average height and weight 13-
346 
year-old boy, a boy of similar height but who weighed 6 kg more would have a 30% increased risk of liver 
347 
cancer.89 Besides the weight trajectory, other mechanisms appear to influence the spectrum of liver 
348 
damage in NAFLD later in life. In the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study 90, after a follow-up of 31 
349 
years, adult NAFLD was predicted by modifiable as well as non-modifiable risk factors during childhood, 
350 
including BMI and insulin levels, male sex, genetic background (that is, PNPLA3 and TM6SF2 variants) and 
351 
low birth weight, an emerging risk factor for adulthood NAFLD probably related to intrauterine epigenetic 
352 
regulations. Overall, this means that NAFLD and its complications, including HCC, are more likely to be 
353 
anticipated at a fairly young age, foreseeing a possible reduction of life expectancy and an additional 
354 
societal burden.  
355 
Risk factors: nature or nurture?

Evidence from patients that have undergone serial liver biopsies over an interval of several years 
357 
demonstrates that the progression of NAFLD from steatosis to NASH and fibrosis is not linear and is likely to 
358 
be more dynamic than previously thought.38,91 Furthermore, evidence from familial aggregation and twin 
359 
studies have shown a significant heritable component to NAFLD.92,93 Interestingly, the genetic susceptibility 
360 
for the development of steatosis and fibrosis may be shared.94 Different ethnic groups have disparate 
361 
propensities to advanced disease, with Hispanics being more susceptible than whites, while the lowest 
362 
susceptibility is observed in blacks.95 An interesting systematic review suggested that the leading 
363 
explanations for the lowest incidence and prevalence of both NAFLD and NASH in African-Americans in the 
364 
United States is related to genetic differences in lipid metabolism, i.e. lower triglyceride levels and 
365 
significantly higher serum HDL-c in this ethnic group compared to Hispanics and Caucasians with NAFLD. 96 
366 
In NAFLD, genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified novel loci associated with disease 
367 
severity phenotypes. A full discussion is beyond the scope of this article but the available literature has 
368 
recently been reviewed elsewhere.97 To date, non-synonymous SNPs in two genes in particular: patatin-like 
369 
phospholipase domain-containing 3 (PNPLA3) and transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2 (TM6SF2) have 
370 
most consistently been validated in separate large cohorts.98,99 Figure 1 shows the distribution of PNPLA3 
371 
genotypes in NAFLD patients according to geographical areas. PNPLA3 is presented as MAF frequency. 
372 
Amongst the emerging newly discovered risk loci, variants near the membrane bound O-acyltransferase 
373 
domain-containing 7 gene (MBOAT7) and transmembrane channel-like 4 gene (TMC4) have been shown to 
374 
be associated with development and severity of NAFLD in patients of European descent.100 Similarly, within 
375 
the Latino population in South America, the TM6SF2 E167K and PNPLA3 I148M gene variants seem to be 
376 
responsible for susceptibility to progressive NASH.101 
377 
Whilst there have been major advances uncovering the genetic basis for the heritability of NAFLD, heritable 
378 
mechanisms other than those encoded within the nucleotide sequence of genes are emerging. Small non- 
379 
coding RNAs such as microRNAs (miRNAs), recently been shown to explain discordant NAFLD in genetically 
380 
identical twins.102 Epigenetic factors may also be a mechanism through which environmental exposures 
381 
exert a heritable effect on disease risk. Remodelling of DNA methylation at key fibrosis modifier genes 
382

----- Page 21 (native) -----
20 
 
underpinned murine ancestral protection to liver fibrosis.103 Remarkably, similar remodelling occurred in 
383 
NASH patients with mild fibrosis and there is intriguing data to suggest that epigenetic signatures present in 
384 
the blood on circulating cell-free DNA may be a potential biomarker of this effect and thus disease severity. 
385 
103,104 
386 
Genetic predisposition must be placed in the context of environmental factors that also play an important 
387 
role. The most relevant factors are dietary habits, activity and socio-economic factors. 
388 
Although a large amount of data suggests that dietary composition may predispose subjects to NAFLD, 
389 
evidence at the population level is less well characterised. In this context, a recent study reported that 
390 
subjects with NAFLD tended to reside in areas with many food source options including grocery stores, 
391 
restaurants and fast food places. Furthermore, those with NAFLD were more likely to report having the 
392 
unhealthiest eating habits (eating foods with high fat, high salt, high sugar/corn syrup, processed foods) 
393 
and reported eating more frequently at restaurants.105 Other studies focused on the nutritional 
394 
assessments of subjects with NAFLD have further documented consumption of low-nutrient, high sodium 
395 
and high fat foods, especially diets with high-fat food from meat and lower amounts of fresh fruits.106,107 In 
396 
addition to the dietary habits, subjects with fatty liver were found to have very low physical activity levels 
397 
and increased sitting times.108-110 
398 
The prevalence of NAFLD is also related to socio-economic factors, but their exact role is debated. In a 
399 
study exploring the role of environmental factors in different ethnic groups with NAFLD, acculturation, 
400 
educational level, healthcare use, and income along with dietary and lifestyle factors and sleep, were not 
401 
found to be independently associated with risk of developing NAFLD, suggesting that the environmental 
402 
factors may play a role on a background of genetic predisposition.16 
403 
Alcohol consumption in the context of NAFLD should be carefully considered. Data from the SHIP study 
404 
demonstrates that the presence of obesity and alcohol consumption are not mutually exclusive. In subjects 
405 
with radiologically diagnosed hepatic steatosis, 27.3% of males and 9.7% of females fulfilled criteria for 
406 
both obesity and high alcohol consumption (i.e. Dual Aetiology Fatty Liver Disease, ‘DAFLD’).111 Prospective 
407

----- Page 22 (native) -----
21 
 
data from the UK in 9559 men with up to 42-years of follow up unequivocally show that alcohol 
408 
consumption and the presence of obesity act synergistically to increase the risk of liver disease morbidity 
409 
and mortality.112 Ultimately, to fully address the impact of even moderate alcohol consumption on NAFLD 
410 
will require prospective, longitudinal studies recording cumulative lifetime alcohol consumption.  
411 
Overall, these data confirm the concept that NAFLD is a complex disease and is affected by inter-related 
412 
environmental factors and genetic predisposition. The exact contribution of each of the genetic or 
413 
environmental components in the promoting the burden of NAFLD is not known and may vary in different 
414 
regions of the world. Therefore, future studies need to focus on this gap of knowledge in order to better 
415 
determine treatment and improve patient outcomes. 
416 
 
417 
Global perspectives, healthcare challenges and prevention strategies  
418 
With an estimate of 64 million individuals affected in the United States and 52 million in European 
419 
countries, 1,113 what clearly sets NAFLD apart from other common liver diseases is the sheer volume of 
420 
patients. In this context, the major focus of clinical care is discerning NAFLD subjects at highest risk for liver-
421 
related complications. The recently released EASL-EASD-EASO guidelines recommend that individuals with 
422 
obesity or any component of the metabolic syndrome should have an ultrasound, steatosis biomarkers and 
423 
liver enzymes measured.114 Further, a burning issue is the development of HCC in non-cirrhotic NASH. As 
424 
the clinical consequences of NAFLD grow, the economic consequences will also increase. A recent model on 
425 
the population of US and of four European countries (Germany, France, Italy, and United Kingdom) 
426 
estimated the annual burden associated with all incident and prevalent NAFLD cases at $103 billion in the 
427 
United States ($1,613 per patient) and at €35 billion in the Europe-4 countries (from €354 to €1,163 per 
428 
patient).113 In a study of Medicare NAFLD patients, the mean yearly inflation-adjusted charges from the 
429 
outpatient setting increased from $2,624 ± $3,308 in 2005 to $3,608 ± $5,132 in 2010.115 If we assume the 
430 
annual rate of increase in the costs due to NAFLD to parallel the annual growth in the prevalence of obesity, 
431 
the expected 10-year burden of NAFLD could increase to an estimated $1.005 trillion in the United States 
432

----- Page 23 (native) -----
22 
 
and €334 billion in the Europe. 113 In addition to the direct annual cost of NAFLD, there is a societal cost 
433 
related to the loss of QALYs and the burden of metabolic complications, including cardiovascular disease.  
434 
The main question is whether this enormous cost would be justified, provided it will be affordable. Cost-
435 
utility analysis of NASH screening is hampered by the lack of evidence around the early stages of the 
436 
disease progression, uncertainties around the non-invasive markers of liver damage and the lack of 
437 
effectiveness data relating to the impact of treatment in patients with NASH. Steatosis testing has not been 
438 
recommended by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) NAFLD Guideline 
439 
Committee (GC), due to the uncertainty both in the cost effectiveness results for all tests and in the clinical 
440 
evidence base.116 On the other hand, both the EASL-EASO-EASD and the UK NAFLD CG recommend 
441 
biomarkers and transient elastography/ARFI to screen subjects with NAFLD for advanced fibrosis and 
442 
cirrhosis.114,116 In the end, screening for NASH will likely be cost-effective when medications with 
443 
reasonable efficacy and side effects will be available.  
444 
 
445 
Conclusions 
446 
NAFLD is now the leading cause of chronic liver disease in the United States and Europe and increasing 
447 
worldwide, but there is a paucity of prospective population-based cohort studies from other geographical 
448 
areas, including South America, Asia, Australia and Africa, which are needed to better understand the 
449 
global burden of disease. Understanding the genetic and environmental risk factors of NAFLD and NASH 
450 
and their distribution across different countries is of paramount importance to develop strategies to 
451 
implement a multipronged public health policy and deal with this important chronic liver disease.
