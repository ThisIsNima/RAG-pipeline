Rapid growth in the market for electric vehicles is imperative, to meet global targets 
for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, to improve air quality in urban centres and to 
meet the needs of consumers, with whom electric vehicles are increasingly popular. 
However, growing numbers of electric vehicles present a serious waste-management 
challenge for recyclers at end-of-life. Nevertheless, spent batteries may also present an 
opportunity as manufacturers require access to strategic elements and critical 
materials for key components in electric-vehicle manufacture: recycled lithium-ion 
batteries from electric vehicles could provide a valuable secondary source of materials. 
Here we outline and evaluate the current range of approaches to electric-vehicle 
lithium-ion battery recycling and re-use, and highlight areas for future progress. 
The electric-vehicle revolution, driven by the imperatives to decarbonize 
personal transportation in order to meet global targets for reductions 
in greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality in urban centres, is 
set to change the automotive industry radically. In 2017, sales of electric 
vehicles exceeded one million cars per year worldwide for the first time1. 
Making conservative assumptions of an average battery pack weight 
of 250 kg and volume of half a cubic metre, the resultant pack wastes 
would comprise around 250,000 tonnes and half a million cubic metres 
of unprocessed pack waste, when these vehicles reach the end of their 
lives. Although re-use and current recycling processes can divert some 
of these wastes from landfill, the cumulative burden of electric-vehicle 
waste is substantial given the growth trajectory of the electric-vehicle 
market. This waste presents a number of serious challenges of scale; in 
terms of storing batteries before repurposing or final disposal, in the 
manual testing and dismantling processes required for either, and in 
the chemical separation processes that recycling entails.
Given that the environmental footprint of manufacturing electric 
vehicles is heavily affected by the extraction of raw materials and pro-
duction of lithium ion batteries, the resulting waste streams will inevi-
tably place different demands on end-of-life dismantling and recycling 
systems. In the waste management hierarchy, re-use is considered pref-
erable to recycling (Fig. 1). Because considerable value is embedded in 
manufactured lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), it has been suggested that 
their use should be cascaded through a hierarchy of applications to 
optimize material use and life-cycle impacts2. Markets for energy storage 
are under development as energy regulators in various locations transi-
tion to cleaner energy sources. Energy storage is particularly sought-
after in areas where weak grids require reinforcement, where high 
penetration of renewables requires supply to be balanced with demand, 
where there is an opportunity for trading energy with the grid and in off-
grid applications. Second-use battery projects have started to develop 
in locations where there is regulatory and market alignment. However, 
large concentrations of waste—be it for refurbishment, re-manufacture, 
dismantling or final disposal—can create substantial challenges. A fire 
in stockpiled tyres in Powys, Wales, for example, smouldered for fifteen 
years from 1989 to 2004. Since the electrode materials in LIBs are far 
more reactive than tyre rubber3, without a proactive and economically 
sound waste-management strategy for LIBs there are potentially greater 
dangers associated with stockpiling of end-of-life LIBs. Already the 
number of fires being reported in metal-recovery facilities is increas-
ing4, owing to the illicit or accidental concealment of (consumer) LIBs 
in the guise of, for example, lead–acid batteries. Among examples of 
recent major fires are those that took place in metal-recovery facilities 
in Shoreway, San Carlos, USA, in September 20165, Guernsey in August 
2018 and Tacoma, Washington, USA, in September 2018.
Waste may also represent a valuable resource. Elements and materials 
contained in electric-vehicle batteries are not available in many nations 
and access to resources is crucial in ensuring a stable supply chain. In the 
future, electric vehicles may prove to be a valuable secondary resource 
for critical materials, and it has been argued that high-cobalt-content 
batteries should be recycled immediately to bolster cobalt supplies6. 
If tens of millions of electric vehicles are to be produced annually, care-
ful husbandry of the resources consumed by electric-vehicle battery 
manufacturing will surely be essential to ensure the sustainability of 
the automotive industry of the future, as will a material- and energy-
efficient 3R system (reduce, re-use, recycle). Here we give an overview

Fig. 1 | The waste management hierarchy and range of recycling options. The 
waste management hierarchy is a concept that was developed from the Council 
Directive 75/442/EEC of 15 July 1975 (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/
EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A31975L0442) on waste by the Dutch politician Ad 
Lansink, in 1979, who presented to the Dutch parliament a simple schematic 
representation that has been termed ‘Lansink’s Ladder’, ranking waste 
management options from the most to least environmentally desirable options. 
Here, that hierarchy is expanded to consider the range of battery recycling 
technologies. ‘Prevention’ means that LIBs are designed to use less-critical 
materials (high economic importance, but at risk of short supply) and that 
electric vehicles should be lighter and have smaller batteries. ‘Re-use’ means 
that electric-vehicle batteries should have a second use. ‘Recycling’ means that 
batteries should be recycled, recovering as much material as possible and 
preserving any structural value and quality (for example, preventing 
contamination). ‘Recovery’ means using some battery materials as energy for 
processes such as fuel for pyrometallurgy. Finally, ‘disposal’ means that no value 
is recovered and the waste goes to landfill.

Review
of the current state of the art and identify some of the important issues 
relating to the end-of-life management of electric-vehicle LIBs.
Social and environmental impacts of LIBs
If we consider the two main modes of primary production, it takes 
250 tons of the mineral ore spodumene7,8 when mined, or 750 tons of 
mineral-rich brine7,8 to produce one ton of lithium. The processing of 
large amounts of raw materials can result in considerable environmental 
impacts9. Production from brine, for example, entails drilling a hole in 
the salt flat, and pumping of the mineral-rich solution to the surface. 
However, this mining activity depletes water tables. In Chile’s Salar de 
Atacama, a major centre of lithium production, 65% of the region’s water 
is consumed by mining activities9. This affects farmers in the region who 
must then import water from other regions. The demands on water 
from the processing of lithium produced in this way are substantial, 
with a ton of lithium requiring 1,900 tons of water to extract, which is 
consumed by evaporation9.
By contrast, secondary production would require only 28 tons of 
used LIBs7,8,10 (around 256 used electric-vehicle LiBs8). The net impact 
of LIB production can be greatly reduced if more materials can be 
recovered from end-of-life LIBs, in as close to usable form as possible11. 
However, in the rapid-growth phase of the electric-vehicle market, 
recycling alone cannot come close to replenishing mineral supplies12. 
LIBs are anticipated to last 15–20 years12 based on calendar aging 
(the aging due to time since manufacture) predictions—three times 
longer than lead–acid batteries12. Initial concerns regarding 
resource constraints for LIB production scale-up focused on lithium13; 
however, in the near term, reserves of lithium are unlikely to present a 
constraint14,15.
Of greater immediate concern are cobalt reserves16, which are geo-
graphically concentrated (mainly in the politically unstable Democratic 
Republic of the Congo). These have experienced wild short-term price 
fluctuations and raise multifarious social, ethical and environmental 
concerns around their extraction, including artisanal mines employing 
child labour17. In addition to the environmental imperative for recycling, 
there are clearly serious ethical concerns with the materials supply 
chain, and these social burdens are borne by some of the world’s most 
vulnerable people. Given the global nature of the industry, this will 
require international coordination to support a concerted push towards 
recycling LIBs and a circular economy in materials18.
Battery assessment and disassembly
The waste-management hierarchy considers re-use to be preferable to 
recycling (Fig. 1). As considerable value is embedded in manufactured 
LIBs, it has been suggested that their use should be cascaded through 
a hierarchy of applications to optimize material use and life-cycle 
impacts2. Energy stored over energy invested (ESOI)—the ratio between 
the energy that must be invested into manufacturing the battery and the 
electrical energy that it will store over its useful life—is a metric used to 
compare the efficacy of different energy-storage technologies. Clearly, 
ESOI figures will improve if end-of-life electric-vehicle batteries can be 
used in second-use applications for which the battery performance is 
less critical.
Profitable second-use applications also provide a potential value 
stream that can offset the eventual cost of recycling, and already a 
healthy market is developing in used electric-vehicle batteries for energy 
storage in certain localities, with demand potentially outstripping sup-
ply. For the moment the economics of the decision whether to recycle 
or re-use are set firmly in favour of re-use. The main factors are (1) the 
refurbishment cost of putting the battery into a second-use application 
and (2) any credit that would accrue as the result of recycling the bat-
tery instead; if the second-use price were to fall below the sum of the 
refurbishment cost and the recycling credit, then recycling would be 
the economically favoured option19. In time, it is anticipated19 that the 
supply of used electric-vehicle batteries will far exceed the quantity that 
the second-use market can absorb. It must be remembered, therefore, 
that—if disposal to landfill is to be avoided—recycling must be the ulti-
mate fate of all LIBs, even if they first have a second use.
Given that stockpiling of waste batteries is potentially unsafe and 
environmentally undesirable, if direct re-use of an LIB module is not 
possible, it must be repaired or recycled. End-of-life LIB recycling could 
provide important economic benefits, avoiding the need for new min-
eral extraction20 and providing resilience against vulnerable links21 
and supply risks22 in the LIB supply chain. For most remanufacture and 
recycling processes, battery packs must be disassembled to module 
level at least. However, the hazards associated with battery disassem-
bly are also numerous23,24. Disassembly of battery packs from automo-
tive applications requires high-voltage training and insulated tools 
to prevent electrocution of operators or short-circuiting of the pack. 
Short-circuiting results in rapid discharge, which may lead to heating 
and thermal runaway. Thermal runaway may result in the generation of 
particularly noxious byproducts, including HF gas25, which along with

----- Page 3 (native) -----

other product gases may become trapped and ultimately result in cells 
exploding23. The cells also present a chemical hazard owing to the flam-
mable electrolyte, toxic and carcinogenic electrolyte additives, and the 
potentially toxic or carcinogenic electrode materials.
Diagnostics of battery pack, modules and cells
‘State of health’ is the degree to which a battery meets its initial design 
specifications. Over time as the battery degrades, its performance var-
ies from its initial condition. The units are percentage points, with 100% 
indicating a state of health that is identical to that of a new battery meet-
ing its design specification. (Some new batteries may leave the factory 
deviating from design specifications, and having less than 100% state of 
health.) The ‘state of charge’ is the degree to which a battery is charged 
or discharged. Again, the units are percentage points, with 0% indicating 
empty and 100% indicating full).
Battery repurposing—the re-use of packs, modules and cells in other 
applications such as charging stations and stationary energy storage—
requires accurate assessment of both the state of health, to categorize 
whether batteries are best suited for re-use (and if so, for which applica-
tions), remanufacture or recycling, and the state of charge, for safety 
reasons in some recycling processes. For high-throughput triage and 
gateway testing of batteries at scale, the optimal approach involves 
in situ techniques for monitoring cells in service to enable advance 
warning of possible cell replacement, and module or pack recondition-
ing, rather than complete repurposing at a low level of state of health 
owing to a few failing cells.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy can give information on 
the state of health of cells, modules and, potentially, full packs26, and 
also an indication of aging mechanisms such as lithium plating. Such 
measurements have the potential to inform a decision matrix for re-use 
or disassembly and processing and, importantly, to identify potential 
hazards that would have further consequences for downstream process-
ing. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy has been researched for 
gateway testing in primary production, for example, in a large battery 
production plant in the UK27,28. A number of electric-vehicle manufactur-
ers plan to use similar technologies to manage and maintain electric-
vehicle battery packs through the identification and replacement of 
failing modules in the field. Substantial advantages in cost, safety and 
throughput time are anticipated if this process can be mostly or fully 
automated27,29. In future, more advanced diagnostic functionality will 
be embedded in battery management systems, providing data that can 
be interrogated at end-of-life.
Challenges of pack and module disassembly
Different vehicle manufacturers have adopted different approaches 
for powering their vehicles, and electric vehicles on the market pos-
sess a wide variety of different physical configurations, cell types 
and cell chemistries. This presents a challenge for battery recycling. 
Figure 2 details three different types of battery cell design, and their 
respective packs from electric vehicles in the marketplace from model 
year 2014. It can be seen that the three vehicles possess very differ-
ent physical configurations, requiring different approaches for dis-
assembly, particularly regarding automation. It can be seen in Fig. 2 
that at the different scales of disassembly, the format and relative size 
of the different components differ, presenting challenges for auto-
mation. The differing form factors and capacities may also restrict 
applications for re-use. And finally, Fig. 2 illustrates that manufactur-
ers employ varying cell chemistries (see Fig. 3), which will necessitate 
different approaches to materials reclamation and strongly affect the 
overall economics of recycling. Whereas the prismatic and pouch cells 
have planar electrodes, the cylindrical cells are tightly coiled, presenting 
additional challenges to separating the electrodes for direct recycling 
processes.
For repurposing and second-use applications, automotive battery 
packs are currently dismantled by hand for either the second use of 
the modules or for recycling. The weights and high voltages of trac-
tion batteries mean that qualified employees and specialized tools are 
required for such dismantling25. This is a challenge for an industry in 
transition with a shortage of skills. An Institute of the Motor Industry 
survey found only 1,000 trained technicians in the UK capable of servic-
ing electric vehicles30, with another 1,000 in training. Given there are 
170,000 motor technicians in the UK, this represents less than 2% of the 
workforce. There is concern that untrained mechanics may risk their 
lives repairing electric vehicles31, and these concerns logically extend 
to those handling vehicles at the end-of-life. Additionally, it has been 
suggested32 that manual dismantling, in countries with high labour 
costs, is uneconomic with respect to revenues from extracted materi-
als or components. Vehicle design has to strike compromises between 
crash safety, centre of gravity and space optimization, which must be 
balanced against serviceability25. These conflicting design objectives 
often result in designs that are not optimized for recyclability, and that 
can be time-consuming to disassemble manually25.
Automating battery disassembly
Robotic battery disassembly could eliminate the risk of harm to human 
workers, and increased automation would reduce cost, potentially mak-
ing recycling economically viable. This is being piloted in a number 
of current research projects33–36. Importantly, automation could also 
improve the mechanical separation of materials and components, 
enhancing the purity of segregated materials and making downstream 
separation and recycling processes more efficient. The automation of 
the dismantling of automotive batteries, however, presents major chal-
lenges. This is because robotics and automation in the manufacturing 
sector rely on highly structured environments, in which robots make pre-
programmed repetitive actions with respect to exactly known objects 
in fixed positions. In contrast, the development of robotic systems that 
can generalize to a variety of objects, and handle uncertainty, remains 
a major challenge at the frontier of artificial intelligence research. It is 
important to consider the complexity of vehicle battery disassembly 
from this perspective.
At present there is no standardization37 of design for battery packs, 
modules or cells within the automotive sector, and it is unlikely that 
this will happen in the near future. Other battery-reliant products, such 
as mobile phones, have seen an exponential proliferation of different 
sizes, shapes and types of battery over the past two decades. At present, 
much of the factory assembly of these batteries is done by human work-
ers and remains unautomated. Their disassembly and waste-handling 
typically involve even less structured environments, with much greater 
uncertainties, than a manufacturing assembly line.
Nevertheless, some progress has been made towards automated 
sorting of consumer batteries. The Optisort system38,39 uses computer 
vision algorithms to recognize the labels on batteries, and then pneu-
matic actuators to segregate batteries into different bins according to 
their type of chemistry. However, Optisort is currently limited to AA and 
AAA batteries, and a large amount of pre-sorting by hand is needed to 
separate these from mixed batches of waste batteries, prior to entering 
the Optisort machine.
The Society for Automotive Engineers and the Battery Association 
of Japan have both recommended labelling standards for electric-
vehicle batteries. Recent algorithms from computer vision research 
have some capability to recognize objects and materials on the basis 
of features such as size, shape, colour and texture. However, it could be 
advantageous for recycling if manufacturers were to (some manufactur-
ers already do) include labels, QR Codes, RfID tags or other machine- 
readable features on key battery components and sub-structures. 
Where these provide a reference to an external data source, its utility 
in aiding the recycling process will depend on the accessibility and 
format of that data. If proprietary and private, such data are of limited 
use, but there may be initiatives to move towards standardization and 
open data formats. A number of companies are considering blockchain

----- Page 4 (native) -----
technologies to provide whole-life-cycle tracking of battery materials, 
including information and transparency on provenance, ethical sup-
ply chains, battery health and previous use40. China has signalled its 
intention to track battery materials.
Automated disassembly of electrical goods has also been imple-
mented to some extent in other sectors. For example, Apple has imple-
mented an automated disassembly line for the iPhone 641 that can handle 
1.2 million phones per year. This line has 22 stations linked on a conveyor 
system and can take the iPhone apart in 11 seconds. However, this system 
can only deal with an iPhone 6 model. Intact phones, of this exact model, 
must be positioned at the start of the disassembly line, which then uses 
pre-programmed motions of 29 robots in 21 different cells to dismantle 
the phone into 8 discrete parts. The LIB is removed by heating the glue 
which holds the battery in place. Owing to the potential fire hazard, 
this must take place inside a thermal event protection system, while 
monitoring the battery using a thermal imaging system.
Unfortunately, 1.2 million phones per year is a drop in the ocean 
and the Apple disassembly line has been created using conventional 
industrial automation methods, making it inflexible and incapable of 
keeping up adaptively with new models and varieties of phones. But 
building a flexible and adaptable robot disassembly line need not be pro-
hibitively expensive. The challenge is to create control algorithms and 
software that can make cheap hardware (robot arms cost only several 
thousands to several tens of thousands of dollars and costs have been 
steadily decreasing, can work all the time, and have very long service 
lifetimes) behave flexibly and intelligently to handle hugely complex 
disassembly problems. If those artificial intelligence challenges can 
be solved, then the capital investment required to respond to new and

Fig. 2 | Examples of three different battery packs and modules (cylindrical, 
prismatic and pouch cells) in use in current electric cars. The three designs 
examined are from model year 2014; this is based on the availability of 
information from vehicle teardowns, and also because older vehicles are more 
likely to be closer to end-of-life than today’s new cars. The breakdowns include 
material content in a cell, layout and content of the module and pack and the 
proportion of critical elements (high economic importance, but at risk of short 
supply) and strategic materials (either high economic importance or risk of 
short supply) used. The Nissan pouch cells from Automotive Energy Supply 
Corporation (AESC) exhibit a mixed cathode chemistry with substantial 
manganese content and relatively low levels of cobalt. The Tesla cylindrical 
18650 cells from Panasonic and the BMW prismatic cells from Samsung SDI both 
contain high cobalt levels. Each cell has particular recycling challenges. 
Cylindrical cells are often bonded into a module using epoxy resin (difficult to 
remove or recycle); fuses at each end may be blown, making cell discharge 
challenging; and the cell geometry can be difficult to dismantle for direct 
recycling. Prismatic cells require ‘can opening’ (requiring special tools) to 
remove the contents. These large cells are under considerably more pressure 
than are the pouch or cylindrical cells, and can therefore be hazardous to open if 
the contents have degassed. The high manganese content of the Nissan pouch 
cells makes pyrometallurgical recycling less cost-effective, because manganese 
is cheap, but these cells are the least problematic to open and physically separate 
for direct recycling.

changing models could be kept remarkably low (mainly software 
updates would be needed). Making robots behave intelligently will 
rely heavily on sensors to enable advanced robotic perception, espe-
cially computer vision using three-dimensional RGB-D imaging devices, 
combined with bespoke sensors from materials and battery experts. The 
robots will also require tactile and force-sensing capabilities to handle 
the complex dynamics problems of forceful interactions between the 
robots and the materials being disassembled.
Owing to the complexity of automotive battery packs, the possibil-
ity of collaborative human–robot co-working using a new generation 
of force-sensitive ‘co-bot’ robot arms33,42 has been suggested. Unlike 
conventional industrial robots, these co-bots can safely share a work-
space with humans, and Wegener33 suggests that the robot could be 
taught tasks such as unscrewing bolts, while the human handles cog-
nitively more complex tasks. However, this approach does not protect 
the human worker from battery hazards and even the task of locating 
a bolt, moving a tool to engage with it, unscrewing and removing it 
represents a cutting-edge research challenge in robotics and machine 
vision. Using current industrial robotics methods, the problem only 
becomes attemptable (but still difficult) provided that the position 
of the bolt head is always exactly fixed, in a known pose relative to the 
robot, with very high precision.
State-of-the-art robotics, computer vision and artificial-intelligence 
capabilities for handling diverse waste materials do exist, and these 
systems have demonstrated sufficient robustness and reliability to gain 
acceptance by the UK nuclear industry, for example, in the deployment 
of artificial-intelligence-controlled, machine-vision-guided robotic 
manipulation for cutting of contaminated waste material in radioac-
tive environments43. These technologies are now being adapted to the 
demanding problem of robotic battery disassembly. At different scales 
of disassembly—pack removal, pack disassembly, module removal and 
cell separation—different challenges and barriers to automation exist. 
Some of these are set out in Fig. 4. Computer-vision algorithms are being 
developed that can identify diverse waste materials and objects44, reli-
ably track objects in complex, cluttered scenes45, and dynamically guide 
the actions of robot arms46. Dismantling requires forceful interaction 
between robots and objects, engendering complex dynamics and con-
trol problems, such as simultaneous force and motion control47, which 
is needed for robotic cutting or unscrewing. Dismantled materials must 
be grasped and manipulated, including fragmented or deformable 
materials, which pose challenges both to vision systems and autono-
mous grasp planners. Adjigble et al.48 have recently demonstrated 
state-of-the-art performance in autonomous, vision-guided robotic 
grasping of arbitrary objects from random, cluttered heaps. These 
advances in computer vision, artificial intelligence and robotics funda-
mentals offer exceptionally promising tools with which to approach the 
extremely difficult open research challenge of automated disassembly 
of electric-vehicle batteries.
Stabilization and passivation of end-of-life batteries
Once LIBs have been designated for recycling, the three main processes 
involved consist of stabilization, opening and separation, which may 
be carried out separately or together. Stabilization of the LIB can be 
achieved through brine or Ohmic discharge. In-process stabilization 
during opening, however, is the current route preferred in industry, as 
it minimizes costs. This consists of shredding or crushing the batteries 
in an inert gas such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide, or a mixture of carbon 
dioxide and argon. State-of-the art physical processing of LIBs in Europe 
and North America includes the Recupyl8 (France), Akkuser49 (Finland), 
Duesenfeld50 (Germany) and Retriev51 (USA/ Canada) processes. Large-
scale European processes do not currently use stabilization techniques 
prior to breaking cells open, instead opting for opening under an inert 
atmosphere of carbon dioxide or argon (with less than 4% molecular 
oxygen). Opening under carbon dioxide allows for the formation of a 
passivating layer of lithium carbonate on any exposed lithium metal.

Fig. 3 | LIB cathode chemistries. The term LIB covers a range of different 
battery chemistries, each with different performance attributes. The basic 
concept of a LIB is that lithium can intercalate into and out of an open structure, 
which consists of either ‘layers’ or ‘tunnels’. Generally the anode is graphite but 
the cathode material may have different chemistries and structures, which 
result in different performance attributes and there are trade-offs and 
compromises with each technology. The cathode chemistries of LIBs have a 
large impact on the performance of LIBs, and these chemistries have evolved 
and improved. Fig. 3 presents a summary of the different LiB cathode 
chemistries.

a water spray during the opening step51. The water hydrolyses any 
exposed lithium and acts as a heatsink, preventing thermal runaway 
during opening.
Discharging through salt solutions or ‘brine’ (seawater has been used 
previously52,53) is an alternative method that is supposed to render the 
cells safe via the corrosion and subsequent water leaching into the cells 
that passivates the internal cell chemistries. Aqueous solutions of halide 
salts have been shown to result in substantial corrosion at the battery 
terminal ends, whereas alkali metal salts, such as sodium phosphate, 
produce much less corrosion with no water penetration, offering the 
possibility that cells could be assessed and re-used53. This represents a 
considerably safer discharging method than using seawater; however, 
competing electrochemical reactions do occur. Oxygen, hydrogen and 
other gases, such as chlorine (depending upon the salts in the brine), 
will form at the anode and cathode terminals, and can potentially be col-
lected, though the dangers and difficulties associated with this should 
not be underestimated. The time for complete discharge is dependent 
on the solubility of the salt and hence the conductivity of the solution; 
increasing the temperature will also shorten the discharge time. Once 
discharge is complete, the cell components can be separated into dif-
ferent materials streams for further processing: steel can or laminated 
aluminium, separator, anode (graphite, copper, conductive additive), 
binder and cathode (active material, aluminium, carbon black, binder).
The brine discharge method is not suitable for high-voltage modules 
and packs, owing to the high rate of electrolysis and vigorous evolution 
of gases that would occur. However, for low-voltage modules and cells 
(or once a high-voltage pack has been dismantled into its constituent 
components) where the electrolysis can be more carefully controlled, 
this could, in principle, offer a method of discharge in which the hydro-
gen and oxygen could be recovered for other applications, adding to 
the cost-effectiveness of the process54. The downside, however, is that 
contamination of the cell contents threatens to complicate the down-
stream chemical processes or compromise the value of processed 
materials streams.
An alternative to the use of salt solutions is direct Ohmic discharge 
of the battery through a load-bearing circuit. If the electricity can be 
reclaimed from the discharge, this could offset some of the cost of fur-
ther processing. To put it into context, the domestic consumption of 
a standard UK home is up to 4,600 kWh per year. So a 60-kWh battery 
pack at a 50% state of charge and a 75% state of health has a potential 
22.5 kWh for end-of-life reclamation, which would power a UK home for 
nearly 2 hours. At 14.3 p per kWh, this equates to UK£3.22 per pack, which 
may seem a modest gain that does not warrant the cost of investing in 
equipment. However, if it is unrecovered, the energy from discharge 
must be dissipated, and this will add to the cooling burden of the facil-
ity, creating additional costs. Furthermore, an economy of scale is to be 
anticipated when recycling electric vehicle batteries in bulk. Similarly, 
reclaimed energy might make a useful contribution to the profitability 
of repurposing for second use (see section ‘Battery assessment and 
disassembly’).
LIB cells can be shredded at various states of charge, and from a com-
mercial point of view, if discharged modules or cells are to be processed 
in this way, discharge prior to shredding adds cost to the processes. 
Furthermore, exactly what the optimum level of discharge might be 
remains unclear. Depending on cell chemistry and depth of discharge, 
over-discharging of cells can result in copper dissolution into the elec-
trolyte. The presence of this copper is detrimental for materials recla-
mation as it may then contaminate all the different materials streams, 
including the cathode and separator. If the voltage is then increased 
again or ‘normal’ operation resumed55, this can be dangerous because

copper can reprecipitate throughout the cell, increasing the risks of 
short-circuiting and thermal runaway.
Current LIB-processing technologies essentially bypass these 
concerns by feeding end-of-life batteries directly into a shredder or 
high-temperature reactor. Industrial comminution technologies can 
passivate batteries directly but recovered battery materials then require 
a complex set of physical and chemical processes to produce usable 
materials streams. Pyrometallurgical recycling processes (see section 
‘Stabilization and passivation of end-of-life batteries’) at scale may be 
able to accept entire electric-vehicle modules without further disas-
sembly. However, this solution fails to capture much of the embodied 
energy that goes into LIB manufacture, and leaves chemical separation 
techniques with much to do as the battery materials become ever more 
intimately mixed.
Recycling methods
Pyrometallurgical recovery
Pyrometallurgical metals reclamation uses a high-temperature furnace 
to reduce the component metal oxides to an alloy of Co, Cu, Fe and Ni. 
The high temperatures involved mean that the batteries are ‘smelted’, 
and the process, which is a natural progression from those used for other 
types of batteries, is already established commercially for consumer 
LIBs. It is particularly advantageous for the recycling of general con-
sumer LIBs, which currently tends to be geared towards an imperfectly 
sorted feedstock of cells (indeed, the batteries can be processed along 
with other types of waste to improve the thermodynamics and products 
obtained), and this versatility is also valuable with respect to electric-
vehicle LIBs. As the metal current collectors aid the smelting process56, 
the technique has the important advantage that it can be used with 
whole cells or modules, without the need for a prior passivation step.
The products of the pyrometallurgical process are a metallic alloy 
fraction, slag and gases. The gaseous products produced at lower tem-
peratures (<150 °C) comprise volatile organics from the electrolyte and 
binder components. At higher temperatures the polymers decompose 
and burn off. The metal alloy can be separated through hydrometallur-
gical processes (see section ‘Hydrometallurgical metals reclamation’) 
into the component metals, and the slag typically contains the metals 
aluminium, manganese and lithium, which can be reclaimed by further 
hydrometallurgical processing, but can alternatively be used in other 
industries such as the cement industry. There is relatively little safety 
risk in this process, as the cells and modules are all taken to extreme 
temperatures with a reductant for metal reclamation—aluminium from 
the electrode foils and packaging is a major contributor here—so the 
hazards are contained within the processing. In addition, the burning of 
the electrolytes and plastics is exothermic and reduce the energy con-
sumption required for the process. It follows that in the pyrometallurgi-
cal process there is typically no consideration given to the reclamation 
of the electrolytes and the plastics (approximately 40–50 per cent of the 
battery weight) or other components such as the lithium salts. Despite 
environmental drawbacks (such as the production of toxic gases, which 
must be captured or remediated and the requirement for hydrometal-
lurgical post-processing), high energy costs, and the limited number 
of materials reclaimed, this remains a frequently used process for the 
extraction of high-value transition metals such as cobalt and nickel57.
Physical materials separation
For reclamation after comminution, recovered materials can be sub-
jected to a range of physical separation processes that exploit variations 
in properties such as particle size, density, ferromagnetism and hydro-
phobicity. These processes include sieves, filters, magnets, shaker tables 
and heavy media, used to separate a mixture of lithium-rich solution, low-
density plastics and papers, magnetic casings, coated electrodes and 
electrode powders. The result is generally a concentration of electrode 
coatings in the fine fractions of material, and a concentration of plastics, 
casing materials, and metal foils in the coarse fractions58. The coarse 
fractions can be put through magnetic separation processes to remove 
magnetic material such as steel casings and density separation pro-
cesses to separate plastics from foils. The fine product is referred to as 
the ‘black mass’, and comprises the electrode coatings (metal oxides 
and carbon). The carbon can be separated from metal oxides by froth 
flotation, which exploits the hydrophobicity of carbon to separate it 
from the more hydrophilic metal oxides59. An overview of how these pro-
cesses are used by several companies is shown in Fig. 5, which mentions 
the Recupyl8 (France), Akkuser49 (Finland), Duesenfeld50 (Germany) 
and Retriev51 (USA/ Canada) processes.
Often, the polymeric binders from the ‘black mass’ components need 
to be eliminated to liberate the graphite and metal oxides from the cop-
per and aluminium current collectors. Published routes include the 
use of sonication in a solvent such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) 
or dimethylformamide (DMF) to detach the cathode from the current 
collector60, thermal heat treatment to decompose the binder61,62, or dis-
solution of the aluminium current collector63. These processes, however, 
often require high temperatures (60–100 °C) and are relatively slow 
(3 h). While ultrasound can induce faster delamination (1.5 h), this is 
still too slow for a continuous-flow process and the required solvent-
to-solid mass ratios of 10:1 will not be viable on a commercial scale with 
these solvents64.
Recent teardowns of cells indicate that manufacturers are transition-
ing away from fluorinated binders. Many newer batteries are moving 
toward alternative binders on the anode, such as carboxymethyl cel-
lulose (CMC), which is water-soluble, and styrene butadiene rubber 
(SBR), which is not water-soluble but is applied as an emulsion that may 
be easier to remove at end-of-life. There is also work on water-based 
binder systems for cathodes, but this is proving to be more challenging. 
Other studies have used cellulose- and lignin-based binders, although 
many of these are still in the laboratory testing phase65.
Hydrometallurgical metals reclamation
Hydrometallurgical treatments involve the use of aqueous solutions to 
leach the desired metals from cathode material. By far the most common 
combination of reagents reported is H2SO4/H2O2 (ref. 66). A number of 
studies have been carried out in order to determine the most efficient 
set of conditions to achieve an optimal leaching rate. These include: 
concentration of leaching acid, time, temperature of solution, the solid-
to-liquid ratio and the addition of a reducing agent67. In most of these 
studies, it was found that leaching efficiency improved when H2O2 was 
added. Somewhat counterintuitively, it is understood that H2O2 acts 
as a reducing agent to convert insoluble Co(III) materials into soluble 
Co(II) through the reaction7:
2LiCoO (s)+3H SO +H O →2CoSO (aq)+Li SO +4H O +O

A range of other possible leaching acids and reducing agents have 
been investigated68–72. The leached solution may also subsequently 
be treated with an organic solvent to perform a solvent extraction73–75. 
Once leached, the metals may be recovered through a number of pre-
cipitation reactions controlled by manipulating the pH of the solution. 
Cobalt is usually extracted either as the sulfate, oxalate, hydroxide or 
carbonate75–79, and then lithium can be extracted through a precipitation 
reaction forming Li2CO3 or Li3PO4
80,81. An alternative recycling method 
describes mechanochemical treatment of materials, where electrode 
materials are ground with a chlorine compound or complexing agent 
to produce water-soluble salts of cobalt, which can be separated from 
insoluble fractions by washing with water82,83.
Most current recycling processes fall under the umbrella of ‘reagent 
recovery’ because the materials, with sufficient purity, can be re-used 
not just for resynthesizing the original cathode materials, but also in a 
range of other applications, such as the synthesis of CoFe2O4 or MnCo2O4 
(refs. 84–86). Following initial work focused on the leaching and

remanufacture of LiCoO2 (ref. 87), work has since moved on to strate-
gies for new cell chemistries, which typically contain multiple transition 
metals (for example, LiNi1 − x − yMnxCoyO2; NMC). In such cases, once the 
metals have been leached from the cathode material, either sequential 
precipitation is employed to recover the individual metals, or the direct 
remanufacture of the cathode is targeted, such as work to recover NMC88. 
In this work, after leaching the metals from the cathode, the concentra-
tions of the various metals in solution were measured and adjusted to 
match those in the target material (1:1:1 Ni:Mn:Co for NMC-111). The same 
group has applied the technique to NMC with varying metal contents and 
successfully resynthesized such NMC materials through the production 
of a precursor hydroxide, NixMnyCoz(OH)2 with x, y and z varying accord-
ing to the desired final composition of the cathode89.
Other groups have published similar recovery methods with modifica-
tions such as additional solvent extraction steps90, lactic acid or urea as 
an alternative to sulfuric acid (additionally facilitating resynthesis)91,92 as 
well as investigating the effect of magnesium in the resynthesized mate-
rial93. The big issues to be addressed with all solvo-metallurgical pro-
cesses are the volumes of solvents required, the speed of delamination, 
the costs of neutralization and the likelihood of cross-contamination of 
materials. Although shredding is a fast and efficient method of rendering 
the battery materials safe, mixing the anode and cathode materials at 
the start of the recycling process complicates downstream processing. 
A method in which anode and cathode assemblies could be separated 
prior to mechanical or solvent-based separation would greatly improve 
material segregation. This is one of several key areas where designing 
for end-of-life recycling promises to have a real impact, but the historic 
backlog of batteries containing polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) as a 
binder will still need to be processed. It is clear that the current design 
of cells makes recycling extremely complex and neither hydro- nor 
pyrometallurgy currently provides routes that lead to pure streams of 
material that can easily be fed into a closed-loop system for batteries.
Direct recycling
The removal of cathode or anode material from the electrode for 
reconditioning and re-use in a remanufactured LIB is known as direct 
recycling. In principle, mixed metal-oxide cathode materials can be 
reincorporated into a new cathode electrode with minimal changes to 
the crystal morphology of the active material. In general, this will require 
the lithium content to be replenished to compensate for losses due to 
degradation of the material during battery use and because materials 
may not be recovered from batteries in the fully discharged state with 
the cathodes fully lithiated. So far, work in this area has focused primarily 
on laptop and mobile phone batteries, as a result of the larger amounts 
of these available for recycling38. An example of how this recycling route 
could work has been outlined recently94. Cathode strips, obtained after 
dismantling spent batteries, were soaked in NMP before undergoing 
sonication. Powders were either regenerated through simple solid-state 
synthesis with the addition of fresh Li2CO3 or treated hydrothermally 
with a solution containing LiOH/Li2SO4 before annealing.

Review

hydrometallurgical (see section ‘Hydrometallurgical recovery’) recy-
cling processes can recover around 70% of the cathode value11. However, 
for other cathode chemistries that are not as cobalt-rich, this figure 
drops notably11. A 2019 648-lb Nissan Leaf battery, for example, costs 
US$6,500–8,500 new, but the value of the pure metals in the cathode 
material is less than US$400 and the cost of the equivalent amount of 
NMC (an alternative cathode material) is in the region of US$4,000. It 
is important, therefore, to appreciate that cathode material must be 
directly recycled (or upcycled) to recover sufficient value. As direct 
recycling avoids lengthy and expensive purification steps, it could be 
particularly advantageous for lower-value cathodes such as LiMn2O4 
and LiFePO4, where manufacturing of the cathode oxides is the major 
contributor to cathode costs, embedded energy and carbon dioxide 
footprint95.
Direct recycling also has the advantage that, in principle, all battery 
components20 can be recovered and re-used after further processing 
(with the exclusion of separators). Although there is substantial litera-
ture regarding the recycling of the cathode component from spent LIBs, 
research on recycling of the graphitic anode is limited, owing to its lower 
recovery value. Nevertheless, the successful re-use of mechanically 
separated graphite anodes from spent batteries has been demonstrated, 
with similar properties to that of pristine graphite96.
Despite the potential advantages of direct recycling, however, consid-
erable obstacles remain to be overcome before it can become a practical 
reality. The efficiency of direct recycling processes is correlated with the 
state of health of the battery and may not be advantageous where the 
state of charge is low97. There are also potential issues with the flexibility 
of these routes to handle metal oxides of different compositions. For 
maximum efficiency, direct recycling processes must be tailored to spe-
cific cathode formulations, necessitating different processes for differ-
ent cathode materials97. The ten or so years spent in a vehicle—followed, 
perhaps, by a few more in a second-use application—therefore present 
a challenge in an industry where battery formulations are evolving at a 
rapid pace. Direct recycling may struggle to accommodate feedstocks 
of unknown or poorly characterized provenance, and there will be com-
mercial reluctance to re-use material if product quality is affected.
The direct recycling route for cathode coatings is also highly sensitive 
to contamination by other metals, such as aluminium, which results in 
poor electrochemical performance60. In particular, methods of recover-
ing materials for further physical or chemical separation that involve a 
high degree of comminution form fine particles of Al and Cu, which are 
difficult to separate from the electrode coatings. For this reason, pro-
cesses that do not mechanically stress the electrode foils are favoured 
in direct recycling, and separation of the materials streams prior to 
mechanical sorting is preferable. However, methods of removing the 
electrode binder—typically pyrolysis or dissolution—present further 
challenges, such as the production of hazardous byproducts such as 
HF from pyrolysis of the PVDF binder or the use of the highly toxic 
NMP as a solvent for dissolution. The potential for the undesirable 
reaction of the PVDF binder with the electrode material appears to 
be a notable omission in the recycling literature, despite a growing 
body of research illustrating that PVDF is an excellent low-temperature 
fluorinating reagent for metal oxides98. Furthermore, recent research 
suggests that a certain degree of reaction can occur with the cathode 
even under conditions of normal cell operation99.
Biological metals reclamation
Bioleaching, in which bacteria are harnessed to recover valuable met-
als, has been used successfully in the mining industry100,101. This is an 
emerging technology for LIB recycling and metal reclamation and is 
potentially complementary to the hydrometallurgical and pyromet-
allurgical processes currently used for metal extraction102,103; cobalt 
and nickel, in particular, are difficult to separate and require additional 
solvent-extraction steps. The process uses microorganisms to digest 
metal oxides from the cathode selectively104 and to reduce these oxides 
to produce metal nanoparticles105,106. The number of studies that have 
been performed thus far, however, is relatively small and there is plenty 
of opportunity for further investigation in this field. The recycling meth-
ods discussed are compared in Fig. 6.
Summary and opportunities
The electric-vehicle revolution is set to change the automotive industry 
radically, and some of the most profound changes will inevitably relate 
to the management and decommissioning of vehicles at end-of-life. Of 
chief concern are the complex, high-tech power trains and, in particular, 
the LIBs. To put this into perspective, electrification of only 2% of the 
current global car fleet would represent a line of cars—and in due course, 
of end-of-life waste—that could stretch around the Earth. There is wide 
acceptance that, for environmental and safety reasons, stockpiling (or 
worse, landfill) and wholesale transport of end-of-life electric-vehicle 
batteries are not attractive options, and that the management of end-
of-life electric-vehicle waste will require regional solutions.
In the waste management hierarchy, re-use is considered preferable 
to recycling, in order to extract maximum economic value and minimize 
environmental impacts. Many companies in various parts of the world 
are already piloting the second use of electric-vehicle LIBs for a range 
of energy storage applications. Advanced sensors and improved meth-
ods of monitoring batteries in the field and end-of-life testing would 
enable the characteristics of individual end-of-life batteries to be bet-
ter matched to proposed second-use applications, with concomitant 
advantages in lifetime, safety and market value. Even if all the benefits of

second-use are realized, however, it must be remembered that recycling 
(if not landfill) is the inevitable fate of all batteries.
Some recent life-cycle analyses has indicated that the application of 
current recycling processes to the present generation of electric-vehicle 
LIBs may not in all cases result in reductions in greenhouse gas emis-
sions compared to primary production107. More efficient processes are 
urgently needed to improve both the environmental and economic 
viability of recycling, which at present is heavily dependent on cobalt 
content. However, as the amount of cobalt in cathodes is reduced for 
economic and other reasons, to recycle using current methods will become 
less advantageous owing to the lower value of the materials recovered.
At present, there are low volumes of electric-vehicle batteries that 
require recycling. As these volumes increase dramatically, there are 
questions concerning the economies (and diseconomies) of scale in 
relation to recycling operations58. Pyrometallurgical routes, in par-
ticular, suffer from high capital costs, and if full recyclability of LIBs is 
to be achieved, alternative methods are urgently required, rather than 
seeking to recycle only the most economically valuable components.
There are a number of lessons that the future LIB recycling industry 
could learn from the highly successful lead–acid battery recycling indus-
try. As a technology, lead–acid batteries are relatively standardized and 
simple to disassemble and recycle, which minimizes costs, allowing the 
value of lead to drive recycling. Unfortunately, for a rapidly developing 
technology such as electric-vehicle LIBs, such advantages are not likely 
to apply any time soon.
A number of improvements could make electric-vehicle LIB recycling 
processes economically more efficient23, such as better sorting tech-
nologies, a method for separating electrode materials, greater process 
flexibility, design for recycling, and greater manufacturer standardiza-
tion of batteries. There is a clear opportunity for a more sophisticated 
approach to battery recovery through automated disassembly, smart 
segregation of different batteries and the intelligent characterization, 
evaluation and ‘triage’ of used batteries into streams for remanufacture, 
re-use and recycling. The potential benefits of this are many and include 
reduced costs, higher value of recovered material streams, and the near 
elimination of the risk of harm to human workers.
The design of current battery packs is not optimized for easy disassem-
bly. Use of adhesives, bonding methods and fixtures do not lend them-
selves to easy deconstruction either by hand or machine. All reported 
current commercial physical cell-breaking processes employ shredding 
or milling with subsequent sorting of the component materials. This 
makes the separation of the components more difficult than if they 
were presorted and considerably reduces the economic value of waste 
material streams. Many of the challenges this presents to remanufac-
ture, re-use and recycling could be addressed if considered early in the 
design process.
For direct recycling where purity of the recovered materials is 
required, a process which involves less component contamination dur-
ing the breaking stage is important. This would benefit from an analysis 
of the cell component chemistries, and the state of charge and state of 
health of the cells before disassembly into the component parts, rather 
than the production of a mixture of all components. At present, this sepa-
ration has only been performed at a laboratory scale and usually employs 
manual disassembly methods that are difficult to scale up economically. 
The move to greater automation and robotic disassembly promises to 
overcome some of these hurdles. Issues regarding the binder still need 
to be resolved, and acid, alkali, solvent and thermal treatments all have 
their positives and negatives. A cell design for reclamation of materials 
is extremely appealing, with low-cost water-soluble binders.
We have focused here on the scientific challenges of recycling LIBs, 
but we recognize that the ‘system performance’ of the LIB recycling 
industry will be strongly affected by a range of non-technical factors, 
such as the nature of the collection, transportation, storage and logis-
tics of LIBs at the end-of-life. As these vary from country to country 
and region to region, it follows that different jurisdictions may arrive 
at different answers to the problems posed. Research is under way 
in the Faraday Institution ReLiB Project, UK; the ReCell Project, US; at 
CSIRO in Australia and at a number of European Union projects includ-
ing ReLieVe, Lithorec and AmplifII.
Recycling electric-vehicle batteries at end-of-life is essential for many 
reasons. At present there is little hope that profitable processes will be 
found for all types of current and future types of electric-vehicle LIBs 
without substantial successful research and development, so the impera-
tive to recycle will derive primarily from the desire to avoid landfill and 
to secure the supply of strategic elements. The environmental and eco-
nomic advantages of second-use and the low volume of electric-vehicle 
batteries currently available for recycling could stifle the development 
of a recycling industry in some places. In many nations, the elements 
and materials contained in the batteries are not available, and access to 
resources is crucial in ensuring a stable supply chain. Electric vehicles 
may prove to be a valuable secondary resource for critical materials. 
Careful husbandry of the resources consumed by electric-vehicle battery 
manufacturing—and recycling—surely hold the key to the sustainability 
of the future automotive industry.
