The COVID-19 pandemic is a major health crisis aﬀecting several nations, with over 720,000 cases and 33,000
conﬁrmed deaths reported to date. Such widespread outbreaks are associated with adverse mental health con-
sequences. Keeping this in mind, existing literature on the COVID-19 outbreak pertinent to mental health was
retrieved via a literature search of the PubMed database. Published articles were classiﬁed according to their
overall themes and summarized. Preliminary evidence suggests that symptoms of anxiety and depression
(16–28%) and self-reported stress (8%) are common psychological reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic, and
may be associated with disturbed sleep. A number of individual and structural variables moderate this risk. In
planning services for such populations, both the needs of the concerned people and the necessary preventive
guidelines must be taken into account. The available literature has emerged from only a few of the aﬀected
countries, and may not reﬂect the experience of persons living in other parts of the world. In conclusion, sub-
syndromal mental health problems are a common response to the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a need for more
representative research from other aﬀected countries, particularly in vulnerable populations.
1. Introduction
Originating as a cluster of unexplained cases of pneumonia in
Wuhan, China, novel coronavirus disease – oﬃcially designated as
COVID-19 by the World Health Organization – has reached the level of
a pandemic, aﬀecting countries all across the world. To date (March
30th, 2020), over 720,000 conﬁrmed cases and 33,000 deaths attribu-
table to this disease have been reported. In the wake of this global
health crisis, stringent public health measures have been implemented
to curtail the spread of COVID-19 (Adhikari et al., 2020).
Widespread outbreaks of infectious disease, such as COVID-19, are
associated with psychological distress and symptoms of mental illness
(Bao et al., 2020). Psychiatrists across the world should be aware of
these manifestations, their correlates, and strategies to manage them
that encompass both the needs of speciﬁc populations (Yang et al.,
2020) and the precautionary measures necessary to contain the spread
of COVID-19 (Liu et al., 2020a). They should also be aware of lacunae
in the existing literature, which may need to be ﬁlled in over time
through more widespread clinical experience and research.
With the above objectives in mind, the current review was designed
to summarize the existing literature addressing mental health concerns
related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
2. Methodology
2.1. Search methodology and article selection
The current article is a narrative review of the existing literature on
mental health symptoms and interventions relevant to the COVID-19
pandemic. A search of the PubMed electronic database was undertaken
using the search terms “novel coronavirus”, “COVID-19”, “nCoV”,
“mental health”, “psychiatry”, “psychology”, “anxiety”, “depression”
and “stress” in various permutations and combinations. A total of 47
citations were retrieved using this method. On reviewing the above
citations, 19 articles were excluded: 3 because they were available only
in the Chinese language, and 16 because they dealt with other aspects
of the COVID-19 outbreak, such as drug therapy, animal models, public
health and preventive measures, and organization of health care sys-
tems. A careful review of these 16 articles revealed no material relevant
to mental health.
2.2. Methodological and thematic analysis of selected articles
The remaining 28 articles were included in this review. Of these 28
articles, only a minority (n = 4) could be genuinely labelled as “ori-
ginal research”. All these four studies were cross-sectional and ob-
servational in design. The remaining 24 articles consisted of letters to
the editor (n = 16) and editorials or commentary related to mental

health and COVID-19 (n = 8).
As it was not possible to conduct a formal systematic review or
meta-analysis given the nature of the above publications, it was instead
decided to conduct a narrative review, giving priority to the few ob-
servational studies available and brieﬂy summarizing the salient
themes from the other publication types. Five broad themes were
identiﬁed across the 26 publications, and were used to organize the
review: (a) observational studies reporting on mental health symptoms
in particular populations, (b) commentary and correspondence broadly
addressing the psychological impact of COVID-19 on the population, (c)
commentary and correspondence addressing the impact of COVID-19
on healthcare workers, (d) commentary and correspondence speciﬁ-
cally related to high-risk or vulnerable populations, and (e) commen-
tary and correspondence related to methods of delivering mental health
care during the COVID-19 outbreak.
The majority of published articles (18/28 of all articles; 64.3%) and
all the observational studies (4/4; 100%) were from Chinese centres.
There were two publications each from Iran and Canada; one each from
Brazil, Singapore, India and Japan; and two publications with no spe-
ciﬁed country of origin.
3. Results
3.1. Observational studies on mental health problems related to COVID-19
Four studies, all from Chinese centres, examined the frequency of
speciﬁc mental health-related variables in persons aﬀected by the
COVID-19 outbreak (Wang et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2020a; Li et al.,
2020; Xiao et al., 2020b). Their results are summarized in the Table
below (Table 1).
As seen in the above results, only one study has provided rough
estimates of the frequencies of individual mental health symptoms, with
anxiety being the commonest. Anxiety was associated with impaired
sleep in both studies examining this link (Xiao et al., 2020a, b). In the
population-based study, female gender, being a student, having symp-
toms suggestive of COVID-19, and poor perceived health were asso-
ciated with higher rates of anxiety and depression; on the other hand,
the availability of accurate information and the use of speciﬁc pre-
ventive measures, such as hand-washing, seemed to mitigate these ef-
fects (Wang et al., 2020). No descriptive studies of this sort could be
retrieved from other countries.
3.2. Literature addressing the mental health impact of COVID-19 on the
general population
Eight publications, including commentaries (n = 4) and corre-
spondence (n = 5) addressed the potential mental health impact of
COVID-19 on the general population, based on literature from previous
disease outbreaks or speciﬁed theoretical models. There was greater
geographical diversity in this group of publications, with papers origi-
nating from China, Canada, Iran, Japan, Singapore and Brazil.
Two of these papers examined the likely impact of the COVID-19
pandemic in speciﬁc countries. One of these, from Iran (Zandifar and
Badrfam, 2020) highlighted the role of unpredictability, uncertainty,
seriousness of the disease, misinformation and social isolation in con-
tributing to stress and mental morbidity. The authors highlighted the
need for both mental health services, particularly for vulnerable po-
pulations, and the strengthening of social capital to reduce the adverse
psychological impact of the outbreak. Another, from Japan (Shigemura
et al., 2020), emphasised the economic impact of COVID-19 and its
eﬀects on well-being, as well as the likely high levels of fear and panic
behaviour, such as hoarding and stockpiling of resources, in the general
population. This paper also identiﬁed populations at higher risk of
adverse mental health outcomes, including patients with COVID-19 and
their families, individuals with existing physical or psychiatric mor-
bidity, and healthcare workers.

Of the remaining papers, one pointed out that the wide scope and
spread of COVID-19 could lead to a true mental health crisis, especially
in countries with high case loads (Dong and Bouey, 2020) which would
require both large-scale psychosocial crisis interventions, and the in-
corporation of mental health care in disaster management plans in the
future. In a related report (Duan and Zhu, 2020) it was pointed out that
while Western countries have incorporated psychological interventions
into their protocols for disease outbreaks, this has not yet happened in
countries such as China, leading to the emergence and persistence of
stress-related disorders in aﬀected persons. This paper also oﬀered
suggestions for the development of intervention strategies, which will
be summarized in section 3.5 below. In contrast, Bao et al. (2020)
highlighted the services that were already being provided in China, and
also provided a list of strategies for the general public to minimize
outbreak-related stress: (1) assessment of the accuracy of information,
(2) enhancing social support, (3) reducing the stigma associated with
the disease, (4) maintaining as normal a life as feasible while adhering
to safety measures, (5) use of available psychosocial services, particu-
larly online services, when needed. Such methods, in their opinion,
would empower society to handle the COVID-19 outbreak in an adap-
tive manner. Similar strategies were reiterated in a paper from Singa-
pore (Ho et al., 2020) which also discussed the role of improved
screening for mental disorders, improving links between community
and hospital services, and providing accurate information to the general
public in order to minimize maladaptive responses such as “panic” and
paranoia regarding the disease and its transmission. Finally, a brief
review paper (Lima et al., 2020) highlighted the role of anxiety as the
dominant emotional response to an outbreak, and the need for adequate
training of healthcare personnel and the optimal use of technological
advances to deliver mental health care.
In contrast to the above literature on practical considerations, two
papers from Canada (Asmundson and Taylor, 2020a, b) have discussed
the mental health impact of COVID-19 from the point of view of health
anxiety. Health anxiety, which arises from the misinterpretation of
perceived bodily sensations and changes, can be protective in everyday
life. However, during an outbreak of infectious disease, particularly in
the presence of inaccurate or exaggerated information from the media,
health anxiety can become excessive. At an individual level, this can
manifest as maladaptive behaviours (repeated medical consultations,
avoiding health care even if genuinely ill, hoarding particular items); at
a broader societal level, it can lead to mistrust of public authorities and
scapegoating of particular populations or groups. The authors underline
the need for evidence-based research into health anxiety and its de-
terminants, so that valid individual- and population-level strategies can
be developed to minimize it in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic and
future outbreaks of a similar nature.
3.3. Literature addressing the mental health impact of COVID-19 on
healthcare workers
As discussed brieﬂy in section 3.1, healthcare workers are at a sig-
niﬁcant risk of adverse mental health outcomes during the COVID-19
outbreak. Reasons for this include long working hours, risk of infection,
shortages of protective equipment, loneliness, physical fatigue, and
separation from families (Kang et al., 2020).
Excluding observational studies, three papers, all from Chinese
centres, have addressed this topic. One of these vividly illustrates the
gap between planned services at a given hospital and the actual needs
of healthcare workers (Chen et al., 2020). This centre had developed a
three-pronged approach to address the mental health of their staﬀ:
development of an intervention team which would design online ma-
terials, implementation of a psychological assistance hotline, and group
activities for stress reduction. However, this programme met with re-
luctance from the healthcare workers themselves. After direct interac-
tion with the workers, this programme was redesigned to include the
provision of a rest area, care for basic physical needs such as food,
training on the care of COVID-19 patients, information on protective
measures, leisure activities, and periodic visits to the rest area by a
counsellor. This resulted in greater satisfaction among healthcare
workers, and highlights the need for ongoing feedback and modiﬁca-
tion of such programmes if they are not acceptable to the workers
themselves. Liu et al. (2020b) pointed out that mental health profes-
sionals may need to work especially closely with those working in
critical care units, to minimize stress levels and reduce the risk of de-
pression, while Kang et al. (2020) noted the positive impact of tele-
phone helplines for healthcare workers to speciﬁcally address mental
health problems. To date, no literature pertaining to healthcare workers
from other countries has been published.
3.4. Literature related to the mental health risks of COVID-19 in vulnerable
populations
Seven publications (correspondence, n = 6; commentary, n = 1)
have identiﬁed particular populations that may be more vulnerable to
the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and some of these
have provided suggestions regarding interventions and service provi-
sion. The vulnerable groups identiﬁed by these authors include older
adults (Yang et al., 2020), the homeless (Tsai and Wilson, 2020), mi-
grant workers (Liem et al., 2020), the mentally ill (Yao et al., 2020a;
Zhu et al., 2020), pregnant women (Rashidi Fakari and Simbar, 2020)
and Chinese students studying overseas (Zhai and Du, 2020).
Of particular interest to practicing psychiatrists are the two reports
from China (Yao et al., 2020, Zhu et al., 2020) regarding COVID-19 and
patients with pre-existing psychiatric illness. To date, a single outbreak
of COVID-19, aﬀecting around 50 patients and 30 staﬀ, has been re-
ported in a psychiatric hospital, and this was contained by strict
quarantine. Reasons for this may have included overcrowding, lack of
general medical facilities in psychiatric hospitals, lack of knowledge
among mental health professionals, and diﬃculty in obtaining the co-
operation of patients for preventive measures, especially those suﬀering
from psychotic disorders (Zhu et al., 2020). Conversely, patients with
pre-existing mental disorders may be at higher risk of relapse or new
episodes of their disorder due to the stress associted with the COVID-19
outbreak (Yao et al., 2020a). During this period, it is crucial that psy-
chiatrists familiarize themselves with screening and triage procedures,
and work closely with physicians and public health specialists to
minimize the risks that their patients face (Zhu et al., 2020).
With regards to the other populations listed above, speciﬁc issues
raised include the high rates of pre-existing depressive symptoms in the
elderly and their lack of access to mental health services (Yang et al.,
2020); the fears of involuntary admission or imprisonment among the
homeless which may act as a barrier to mental health care (Tsai and
Wilson, 2020); the need for outreach and social support among migrant
worker populations to reduce the risk of common mental disorders
(Liem et al., 2020); the relationship between COVID-19 – related stress
and anxiety and adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes (Rashidi
Fakari and Simbar, 2020); and the potential discrimination and stig-
matization faced by Chinese students overseas during the pandemic,
leading to anxiety and stress-related disorders (Zhai and Du, 2020). In
all these cases, close collaboration between psychiatrists and special-
ities from other branch of medicine, as well as with local authorities
and health workers in the community, is essential.
3.5. Therapeutic interventions and strategies
Five papers (correspondence, n = 2; commentary, n = 3) have
directly addressed the use of speciﬁc strategies to deliver mental health
care to persons aﬀected by the COVID-19 epidemic (Duan and Zhu,
2020; Liu et al., 2020a; Xiao, 2020; Zhou et al., 2020; Yao et al.,
2020b). In addition, a paper from India has discussed the importance of
psychiatrists during the COVID-19 pandemic in general terms. This
paper identiﬁed six important roles for the psychiatrist: a) education of

the public about the common psychological eﬀects of a pandemic, b)
motivating the public to adopt strategies for disease prevention and
health promotion, c) integrating their services with available health
care, d) teaching problem-solving strategies to cope with the current
crisis, e) empowering patients with COVID-19 and their caregivers, and
f) provision of mental health care to healthcare workers (Banerjee,
2020).
With reference to more speciﬁc therapeutic strategies, proposals
include the development of teams of specialists qualiﬁed to address
emotional distress (Duan and Zhu, 2020); the training of community
health personnel in basic aspects of mental health care (Duan and Zhu,
2020); the use of online surveys to assess the scope of mental health
problems (Liu et al., 2020b); the development of online materials for
mental health education (Liu et al., 2020a); the provision of online
counselling and self-help services (Liu et al., 2020b); the use of struc-
tured letters as a form of asynchronous telepsychiatry consultation
(Xiao, 2020); the development of synchronous telemedicine services for
diagnostic purposes as well as counselling (Zhou et al., 2020); and the
need to make online mental health services accessible to individuals
from lower socioeconomic strata (Yao et al., 2020b). Such strategies
oﬀer the hope of providing mental health services in an easily acces-
sible manner without any increase in infection risk. However, they
depend crucially on the availability of trained manpower and infra-
structure, and it is not known to what extent these approaches will be
accepted by the general public. Moreover, they have not yet been tested
or validated in the respective target populations.
4. Conclusions and further directions
Though there are few large-scale observational studies available in
this ﬁeld to date, it is clear that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a
vigorous and multifaceted response from psychiatrists and allied pro-
fessionals, and that mental health is clearly being taken into con-
sideration at multiple levels – in the general population, among
healthcare workers, and in vulnerable populations. Though the quality
of evidence in the available literature is relatively low, it still contains
numerous valuable observations and suggestions for all professionals
working in this ﬁeld, whether they are associated with psychiatric or
general hospitals or working in the community. As the number of pa-
tients aﬀected by this pandemic continues to increase, the psychiatric
profession – particularly in Asian countries – faces both a challenge and
an opportunity; the challenge of addressing the numerous barriers and
limitations identiﬁed in the above literature, but also the opportunity to
implement those suggestions or recommendations which are feasible at
a local or regional level. The long-term mental health impact of COVID-
19 may take weeks or months to become fully apparent, and managing
this impact requires concerted eﬀort not just from psychiatrists but
from the health care system at large (Maunder, 2009). There is a need
for further research, even in the form of preliminary or pilot studies, to
assess the scope of this pandemic in other countries, particularly in
those where mental health infrastructure is less developed and the
impact is likely to be more severe (Duan and Zhu, 2020). Researchers
should also attempt to assess the impact of COVID-19 on other vul-
nerable populations, such as children and adolescents, those in remote
or rural areas who face barriers in accessing health care, and those
belonging to lower socio-economic strate. Further, there is a need to
develop mental health interventions which are time-limited, culturally
sensitive, and can be taught to healthcare workers and volunteers. Once
developed, such interventions should be tested, so that information
regarding eﬀective therapeutic strategies can be widely disseminated
among those working in this ﬁeld.
