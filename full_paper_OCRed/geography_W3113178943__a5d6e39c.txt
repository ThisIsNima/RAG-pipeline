ABSTRACT
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), principally ischemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke, are the leading cause of
global mortality and a major contributor to disability. This paper reviews the magnitude of total CVD burden,
including 13 underlying causes of cardiovascular death and 9 related risk factors, using estimates from the
Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2019. GBD, an ongoing multinational collaboration to provide
comparable and consistent estimates of population health over time, used all available population-level data
sources on incidence, prevalence, case fatality, mortality, and health risks to produce estimates for 204
countries and territories from 1990 to 2019.
Prevalent cases of total CVD nearly doubled from 271 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 257 to
285 million) in 1990 to 523 million (95% UI: 497 to 550 million) in 2019, and the number of CVD deaths
steadily increased from 12.1 million (95% UI:11.4 to 12.6 million) in 1990, reaching 18.6 million (95% UI: 17.1 to
19.7 million) in 2019. The global trends for disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and years of life lost also
increased signiﬁcantly, and years lived with disability doubled from 17.7 million (95% UI: 12.9 to 22.5 million) to
34.4 million (95% UI:24.9 to 43.6 million) over that period. The total number of DALYs due to IHD has risen
steadily since 1990, reaching 182 million (95% UI: 170 to 194 million) DALYs, 9.14 million (95% UI: 8.40 to
9.74 million) deaths in the year 2019, and 197 million (95% UI: 178 to 220 million) prevalent cases of IHD in
2019. The total number of DALYs due to stroke has risen steadily since 1990, reaching 143 million (95% UI: 133
to 153 million) DALYs, 6.55 million (95% UI: 6.00 to 7.02 million) deaths in the year 2019, and 101 million (95%
UI: 93.2 to 111 million) prevalent cases of stroke in 2019.
Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of disease burden in the world. CVD burden continues its
decades-long rise for almost all countries outside high-income countries, and alarmingly, the age-standardized
rate of CVD has begun to rise in some locations where it was previously declining in high-income countries.
There is an urgent need to focus on implementing existing cost-effective policies and interventions if the world
is to meet the targets for Sustainable Development Goal 3 and achieve a 30% reduction in premature mortality
due to noncommunicable diseases. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2020;76:2982–3021) © 2020 The Authors. Published by

ardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a major
cause of premature mortality and rising
health
care
costs
(1,2).
Cardiometabolic,
behavioral, environmental, and social risk factors
are major drivers of CVD. Consistent, comparable,
and systematic analysis of long-term trends and pat-
terns in global CVD are essential to guide public pol-
icy and provide benchmarks for decision makers.
Beginning with ischemic heart disease (IHD) and
stroke,
this
article
provides
information
on
the
burden of CVD, including 13 underlying causes of car-
diovascular death and 9 related risk factors at the
global, regional, and national levels (Supplemental
Figure 1).
This paper explores CVD trends from 1990
to 2019 and examines the extent to which
population growth and aging explain the
observed
trends,
sex
differences,
and
regional patterns and how the epidemiology
of the disease itself is changing. These trends
show us where in the world CVD mortality
and burden are increasing or declining and
where progress has stalled (3). For each of the
contributing causes of cardiovascular death
and risk factors examined, we identify which
regions and countries have the highest and
lowest
estimates
of
prevalent
cases
and
number
of
deaths,

measures including number of years of life lost
(YLLs), number of years lived with disability (YLDs),
and the magnitude and temporal trends in disability-
adjusted life years (DALYs) (1). For each section, the
article also addresses how the summary measures of
health and disease discussed inform investments in
cardiovascular research, their implications for clinical
and
public
health
practice,
and
implications
for
health system development and national and regional
policy.
To improve accessibility across a wide range of
audiences, we have structured the review such that
each section can be read independently for those
most interested in a subset of causes or risks. Dis-
cussion pertinent to each topic is included within
every section. This article is a collaborative effort
involving the Journal of the American College of Car-
diology, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Insti-
tute,
and
the
Institute
for
Health
Metrics
and
Evaluation at the University of Washington designed
to provide crucial population-level information that
can guide action for CVD and risk factor prevention,
treatment, and control (2).
GLOBAL BURDEN OF DISEASE
STUDY METHODS
GBD 2019 is a multinational collaborative research
study that estimates disease burden for every country
in the world (1,4). The study is an ongoing effort,
updated
annually,
and
is
designed
to
allow
for
consistent comparison over time from 1990 to 2019,
by age and sex, and across locations. The study pro-
duces standard epidemiological measures such as
incidence, prevalence, and death rates as well as
summary measures of health, such as DALYs. DALYs
represent the sum of years of life lost prematurely
and years lived with disability; can be estimated from
life tables, estimates of prevalence, and disability
weights; and may be expressed as counts or rates.
Annual updates to the study include new diseases,
new data sources, and updates to methods. All results
are available via the GBD Compare website (5), and all
input data is identiﬁed via the Global Health Data
Exchange website (6). The study is performed in
compliance with Guidelines for Accurate and Trans-
parent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER) guide-
lines for reporting health estimates (1). Detailed
methods
of
GBD
2019
are
reported
in
the
Supplemental Appendix and summarized here.
Each CVD cause and related health states were
identiﬁed with standard case deﬁnitions. IHD repre-
sented acute myocardial infarction, chronic stable
angina, chronic IHD, and heart failure due to IHD.
Myocardial infarction was deﬁned according to the
Fourth Universal Deﬁnition of Myocardial Infarction
and was adjusted to include out-of-hospital sudden
cardiac death. Stable angina was deﬁned according to
the Rose Angina Questionnaire. Stroke was deﬁned
according to the World Health Organization deﬁnition
and was estimated separately for 3 subcategories: 1)
ischemic stroke (IS); 2) intracerebral hemorrhage; and
3) subarachnoid hemorrhage (7). Lower extremity
peripheral artery disease (PAD) was deﬁned by an
ankle brachial index of <0.9. Symptomatic PAD was
deﬁned as self-report of symptoms of claudication
among those with an ankle brachial index of <0.9.
Atrial ﬁbrillation (AF) and atrial ﬂutter (AFL) were
deﬁned by electrocardiogram. Hypertensive heart
disease (HHD) was deﬁned as symptomatic heart
failure due to the direct and long-term effects of hy-
pertension. Cardiomyopathy was deﬁned as symp-
tomatic heart failure due to primary myocardial
disease or toxin exposure to the myocardium, such as
alcohol. Acute myocarditis was deﬁned as an acute
and
time-limited
condition
due
to
myocardial
inﬂammation
using
health
system
administrative
data. Endocarditis and rheumatic heart disease (RHD)
were deﬁned by their clinical diagnosis. Estimates of
RHD include cases identiﬁed by clinical history and
physical
examination,
including
auscultation
or
standard
echocardiographic
criteria
for
deﬁnite
disease.
Mortality was estimated by using vital registration
data coded to the International Classiﬁcation of Dis-
ease (ICD) system or household mortality surveys
known as verbal autopsy. Statistical methods were
used to increase the comparability of mortality data
sources, including the reclassiﬁcation of codes that
are nonspeciﬁc or unspeciﬁed, noise reduction algo-
rithms, and Bayesian geospatial regression software
HIGHLIGHTS
 The burden of CVD, in number of DALYs
and deaths, continues to increase
globally.
 CVD burden attributable to modiﬁable
risk factors continues to increase
globally.
 Countries should invest in existing cost-
effective public health programs and
clinical interventions to target modiﬁable
risks, promote healthy aging across the
lifespan, and reduce disability and pre-
mature death due to CVD.

create smoothed time trends for 204 countries and
territories by borrowing strength over age, space, and
time. GBD 2019 allowed for the production of esti-
mates with uncertainty intervals (UIs) for all locations
in every year, even when data were sparse or missing.
Disease incidence and prevalence were produced by
using a broad range of population-representative data
sources identiﬁed by literature review and via study
collaborations, including scientiﬁc reports of cohorts
and registries, population surveys, microdata from
registry
and
cohort
studies,
and
health
system
administrative
data.
Consistent
disease
estimates
were
produced
by
using
epidemiologic
state-
transition disease modeling software, DisMod-MR
(Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation), and
Bayesian
meta-regression
software,
MR-BRT
(Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation), that
adjusted for study-level differences in measurement
methods and case deﬁnitions. Risk factor exposures
were estimated by using population-representative
survey
and
surveillance
data
and
geospatial
Gaussian process regression models that borrowed
strength across time and geography.
DALYs were calculated as the sum of YLLs, based
on a reference maximum observed life expectancy,
and YLDs based on standardized disability weights
for each health state. Population-attributable frac-
tions were calculated independently by risk factor by
using risk exposures, estimates of relative risk based
on
meta-analyses,
and
theoretical
minimum
risk
levels
determined
for
each
risk-outcome
pair.
Adjustment was made for comorbidity by simulating
40,000
individuals
in
each
age-sex-country-year
exposed to the independent probability of acquiring
conditions based on their prevalence. The 95% UIs
reported for each estimate used 1,000 draws from the
posterior distribution of models, reported as the 2.5th
and 97.5th values of the distribution. Age standardi-
zation was performed via the direct method, applying
a global age structure from the year 2019. The Uni-
versity of Washington Institutional Review Board
Committee approved the Global Burden of Diseases,
Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (STUDY00009060).
CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES
TOTAL CVDs. CVDs are common, have poor survival,
and are increasing worldwide (Central Illustration).
Prevalent cases of total CVD nearly doubled from 271
million (95% UI: 257 to 285 million) in 1990 to 523
million (95% UI: 497 to 550 million) in 2019, and the
number of CVD deaths steadily increased from 12.1
million (95% UI: 11.4 to 12.6 million) in 1990, reaching
18.6 million (95% UI: 17.1 to 19.7 million) in 2019
(Figure 1A). The global trends for DALYs and YLLs
also increased signiﬁcantly, and YLDs doubled from
17.7 million (95% UI: 12.9 to 22.5 million) to 34.4
million
(95%
UI:
24.9
to
43.6
million)
over
that period.
At the country level, age-standardized mortality
rates for total CVD were highest in Uzbekistan, Solo-
mon Islands, and Tajikistan and were lowest in
France, Peru, and Japan, where rates were 6-fold
lower in 2019. From 1990 to 2019, large declines in
the age-standardized rates of death, DALYs, and
YLLs, together with small gradual reductions in age-
standardized rates for prevalent cases and YLDs,
suggest that population growth and aging are major
drivers of the increase in total CVD (Figure 1B).
In 2019, total CVD DALYs were higher in men than
women before age 80 to 84 years (Supplemental
Figure 2). After this age, the pattern reverses. The
sex differences in DALYs is most striking between
ages 30 and 60 years (men greater) and age >80 years
(women greater). The excess CVD deaths in women
beginning at ages 80 to 84 years should focus atten-
tion to cause-speciﬁc mortality at older ages and have
implications for secondary prevention strategies.
Among women, the age-standardized rates for
DALYs were highest in Central Asia, Oceania, North
Africa and the Middle East, and Eastern Europe; and
lowest in High-Income Asia Paciﬁc, Australasia, and
Western Europe (Supplemental Figure 3). Among
men, age-standardized rates for DALYs were highest
in Central Asia, Eastern Europe, and Oceania; and
lowest
in
High-Income
Asia
Paciﬁc,
Australasia,
Western Europe, and Andean Latin America. At the
country level, the highest age-standardized rates
were estimated for many of the islands of Oceania,
Uzbekistan, and Afghanistan, while the lowest rates
for DALYs were seen in Japan, France, and Israel
(Supplemental Figure 4). These regional and national
differences in total CVD burden and mortality reﬂect
differences in prevalence of CVD risk factors as well
as access to health care (8). Differences in access to
effective primary and secondary prevention strate-
gies may also play a role in differences in total CVD
burden, especially in low- and middle-income coun-
tries (LMICs) (9).
Global patterns of total CVD have signiﬁcant im-
plications for clinical practice and public health pol-
icy development (10). Prevalent cases of total CVD are
likely to increase substantially as a result of popula-
tion growth and aging, especially in Northern Africa
and Western Asia, Central and Southern Asia, Latin

projected to double between 2019 and 2050 (11,12).
Increased attention to promoting ideal cardiovascular
health
and
healthy
aging
across
the
lifespan
is
necessary (13). Equally importantly, the time has
come to implement feasible and affordable strategies
for the prevention and control of CVD and to monitor
results (14).
ISCHEMIC
HEART
DISEASE. The total number of
DALYs due to IHD has risen steadily since 1990,
reaching 182 million (95% UI: 170 to 194 million)
DALYs and 9.14 million (95% UI: 8.40 to 9.74 million)
deaths in the year 2019 (Figure 2A). GBD 2019 esti-
mated 197 million (95% UI: 178 to 220 million) prev-
alent cases of IHD in 2019.
Global age-standardized rates for DALYs, deaths,
and prevalent cases declined over this time period,
indicating that, on average, global increases in IHD
have been due to population growth and aging,
although even the age-standardized death rate is
estimated to be increasing in many locations across
South, East, and Southeastern Asia, including China
(Figure 2B). Increasing absolute numbers of incident
and prevalent IHD cases in most countries mean that
national
health
systems
will
need
to
address
increasing demand for IHD-related preventive and
therapeutic services as these trends continue.
At the global level, substantially more total DALYs
due to IHD were experienced by men than women.
IHD DALYs rose rapidly for men beginning at age
30 years (Supplemental Figure 5). Men ages 45 to
49 years had almost as many DALYs due to IHD as
women ages 65 to 69 years.
Age-standardized DALY rates due to IHD were
highest in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Oceania, and
the Middle East/North Africa regions (Supplemental
Figure 6). At the country level, extremely high rates
were estimated for Uzbekistan, Ukraine, Tajikistan,
and many of the islands of Oceania, with the lowest
levels
in
Japan,
Republic
of
Korea,
and
France
(Supplemental Figure 7). Higher exposure to risks
including tobacco and excessive alcohol use and
restricted access to preventive health care may partly
explain these patterns.
IHD remains a major threat to public health, and
overall burden is increasing globally. In some loca-
tions over the past 5 years, including parts of the
United States and United Kingdom, age-standardized
IHD death rates are increasing, suggesting that long-
term declines in IHD due to improved prevention
and health care are no longer occurring in these lo-
cations. Health systems and countries need to focus
on delivering effective interventions that will reverse
these trends, including those that prevent and control
diabetes,
decrease
obesity
and
high
cholesterol,
improve diet and physical activity, reduce tobacco
and excessive alcohol use, integrate “polypills” for
elevated
blood
pressure
and
related
conditions,
improve pre- and in-hospital care for acute coronary
syndrome, and improve survival and quality of life for
those living with the long-term sequelae of IHD,
including heart failure. Social and economic factors
remain fundamental drivers of IHD, suggesting that
multisectoral interventions are needed to eradicate
this disease (15).
STROKE. The
total
number
of
prevalent
strokes,
deaths, and DALYs due to stroke increased steadily
from 1990, reaching 101 million (95% UI: 93.2 to 111
million) prevalent (85.3% [95% UI: 82.6% to 88.2%]
increase) stroke survivors, 6.55 million (95% UI: 6.00
to 7.02 million) deaths from stroke (43.3% [95% UI:
31.0% to 55.4%] increase), and 143 million (95% UI:
133 to 153 million) DALYs due to stroke (32.4% [95%
UI: 22.0% to 42.2%] increase) in 2019, with the bulk of
the
burden
outside
of
the
high-income
world
(Supplemental Figures 8A and 9A). Of 12.2 million
(95% UI: 11.0 to 13.6 million) incident stroke cases,
7.63 million (95% UI: 6.57 to 8.96 million) (62.4%)
were IS, 3.41 million (95% UI: 2.97 to 3.91 million)
(27.9%) were intracerebral hemorrhages, and 1.18
million
(95%
UI:
1.01
to
1.39
million)
(9.7%)
were
subarachnoid
hemorrhages
(Supplemental
Figures 10A, 11A, and 12A).
Globally, age-standardized rates for deaths and
DALYs due to stroke substantially declined over the
same period of time (Supplemental Figures 8B, 10B,
11B, and 12B), suggesting that: 1) preventive mea-
sures are very effective at lowering risk of both
ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke; and 2) on average,
global increases in stroke burden have been largely
due to population growth and aging. Importantly,
age-standardized rates for prevalence of stroke sur-
vivors have increased since 1990 in several locations
including in China, Indonesia, and parts of the United
States. Age-standardized death rates also increased in
some
locations,
including
Indonesia
and
the
Philippines.
Age-standardized rates of DALYs and deaths due to
stroke were substantially greater in men compared to
women, but prevalence was greater in women, sug-
gesting the possibility of greater risk of death and
disability in men but better stroke survival in women.
Similar patterns were observed in men and women
with IS, intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid
hemorrhage.

There is tremendous regional disparity in the burden
of
stroke.
Age-standardized
rates
of
deaths
and
DALYs due to stroke were highest in Oceania, Central
Asia, East Asia, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, and
sub-Saharan Africa (Supplemental Figure 13), and
prevalence of stroke survivors was highest in Oce-
ania, Southeast Asia, East Asia, and the Middle East/
North Africa regions (Figure 3). These data suggest
that applying preventive strategies, such as treatment
of elevated blood pressure and cholesterol levels, can
have major health beneﬁts where stroke burden re-
mains high, especially in those regions that did not
show substantial decline over the past decades (i.e.,
Central Asia, Southern sub-Saharan Africa).
Stroke remains the second-leading cause of death,
and stroke burden in terms of DALYs is increasing.
Primary stroke prevention strategies are not sufﬁ-
ciently effective as currently implemented in many
countries. Large (15- to 20-fold) geographic variations
in age-standardized stroke DALYs and mortality rates
and moderate (4-fold) geographic variations in age-
standardized prevalence may be related to the varia-
tions in stroke risk factors or the quality of and/or
access to preventative care, acute stroke care, and
stroke rehabilitation across the globe. Global and
national
health
systems
need
to
focus
on
new
approaches for delivering stroke prevention that can
reverse these trends, including strategies to provide
equal access to quality health care and prevention
across
all
populations,
and
proven
effective
in-
terventions that reduce mortality and improve out-
comes post-stroke.
HYPERTENSIVE HEART DISEASE. The global preva-
lence of HHD has risen steadily over the last 3 de-
cades, as have the total number of deaths, DALYs,
YLLs, and YLDs due to this disease. In 2019, HHD was
the main cause of 1.16 million (95% UI: 0.86 to 1.28
million) deaths and 21.5 million (95% UI: 16.4 to 23.9
million) DALYs annually, with a global prevalence of
18.6 million (95% UI: 13.5 to 24.9 million) cases
(Supplemental Figure 14A).
The age-standardized prevalence and YLDs of HHD
per 100,000 persons have been constant over time,
and corresponding age-standardized rates of deaths,
DALYs,
and
YLLs
declined
steadily
until
the
mid-2000s
and
have
leveled
off
since
then
(Supplemental Figure 14B). The trends for the ab-
solute
and
age-standardized
estimates
closely
resemble
those
for
high
blood
pressure.
Taken
together, the increasing global prevalence and rates
of HHD can be explained by population growth and

aging, but the declining age-standardized rates of
adverse outcomes are similar to those for IHD and
stroke and are likely an effect of improved sec-
ondary prevention.
The age distributions of DALYs due to HHD are
very similar in women and men until age 70 years
(Supplemental Figure 15). This contrasts to the age
distributions for high blood pressure, in which men
are overrepresented at younger ages. The similarities
by sex in DALYs calls for an equal attention to the
clinical prevention and treatment of HHD in women
and men.
The highest age-standardized rates of DALYs due
to HHD are noted in Africa (Figure 4). DALYs due to
HHD are particularly higher in Central sub-Saharan
Africa, followed by most of Africa except Western
sub-Saharan
Africa,
and
Oceania.
A
similar
geographic pattern exists for high blood pressure
(with the exception of high rates of DALYs in men
from
high
blood
pressure
in
Central
Asia
and
Eastern Europe). An overrepresentation of DALYs
due to HHD in women can be noted in Central and
Eastern
sub-Saharan
Africa
(Supplemental
Figure 16). The
signiﬁcance
of
this is uncertain
because no such peaks are noted for high blood
pressure or other contributing factors, and it can
represent
regional
differences
in
disease
coding,
including that of peripartum cardiomyopathy. In-
equalities in access to both primary and secondary
prevention are a potential cause of these regional
and sex differences.
The global prevalence of HHD and absolute rates of
adverse outcomes are expected to continue to rise
due
to
population
growth
and
aging.
The
age-
standardized rates of adverse outcomes due to HHD
are no longer decreasing, and with continuing global
increases in obesity and diabetes, corresponding in-
creases in left ventricular hypertrophy and other as-
pects
of
HHD
are
likely.
Intensiﬁed
global
and
regional efforts to lower blood pressure and control
other risk factors are needed, for example with
population-wide reductions in dietary sodium intake.
Continued surveillance of inequalities in adverse
outcomes due to high blood pressure are necessary to
inform such efforts.

representing 2,305.2 per 100,000 live births (95% UI:
1,772.9 to 3,039.2 per 100,000 live births), a total of
13.3 million (95% UI: 11.5 to 15.4 million) people were
living with CHA, and CHA was the underlying cause
of
217,000
deaths
(95%
UI:
177,000
to
262,000
deaths), of which 150,000 deaths (95% UI: 120,000 to
184,000 deaths) were in infants <1 year (Figure 5A).
The all-ages rates of DALYs, YLLs, and YLDs for CHA
in 2019 were 241.6 per 100,000 (95% UI: 196.1 to 292.7
per 100,000), 234.0 per 100,000 (95% UI: 189.8 to
285.7 per 100,000), and 7.6 per 100,000 (95% UI: 3.7
to 12.7 per 100,000), respectively (Figure 5B).
Between 1990 and 2019, the global CHA birth rate
was largely unchanged, but the all-ages death rate
due to CHA declined 60.4% (95% UI: –71.9% to
–41.4%) from 7.1 per 100,000 (95% UI: 5.0 to 10.5 per
100,000) in 1990 to 2.8 per 100,000 (95% UI: 2.3 to 3.4
per 100,000) in 2019. Age-standardized prevalence,
death, and DALY rates remain lower than all-ages
rates in low-income countries because of younger
populations, higher birth rates of CHA, and much less
access to the intervention that is needed to allow for
the survival of children born with CHA.
The proportion of all infant deaths caused by CHA
increased in all quintiles of the sociodemographic
index (SDI) since 1990 except the highest because
improvement in CHA mortality has lagged behind
that of other causes, most notably infectious, respi-
ratory, and diarrheal diseases (16). In low-SDI regions,
CHA death rates have declined by 42.1% (95% UI:
–61.9% to 12.1%) since 1990, compared with declines
of 71.3% (95% UI: –74.7% to –64.6%) in high-SDI
subgroups.
Unlike
other
CVDs,
prevention
has
limited ability to reduce the burden of CHA after
birth; improvements in early diagnosis and access to
cardiac surgery are the only solutions.
The total number of global CHA births remained
steady, global CHA deaths decreased by 42.7% (95%
UI: –59.3% to –15.2%), and the global number of
individuals
living
with
CHA
increased
by
28.2%
(95% UI: 26.3% to 30.1%). There were increases in
the
15-
to
49-year
and
the
50-
to
69-year
age
groups, in which the number of individuals living
with CHA grew by 41.6% (95% UI: 40.0% to 43.2%)
and
117.3%
(95%
UI:
114.7%
to
120.0%)
to
4.21
million
(95%
UI:
3.67
to
4.76
million)
and
1.31
million (95% UI: 1.13 to 1.51 million), respectively,
reﬂecting a cohort effect from the time of birth.
Most of the prevalence increase occurred outside of
high-income countries (HICs) and was due to im-
provements
in
survival
and
population
growth.
Health systems will be increasingly burdened with
adolescents
and
adults
needing
care
for
their
congenital heart conditions.
The very young age distribution in LMICs and large
burden of YLLs due to CHA should drive a global
mandate for investment in data collection and re-
sources to expand access to infant heart surgery in
regions in most need. In low-income countries with
very young populations, the prevalence and mortality
from RHD parallel lack of access to cardiac surgery
services for CHA, and pooling resources to care for
both of these diseases makes a stronger case for in-
vestment in surgical services (that includes both in-
country surgical personnel and nongovernmental or-
ganizations) than for either disease alone.
RHEUMATIC
HEART
DISEASE. The
prevalence
of
RHD has been rising steadily since 1990, reaching
40.5 million (95% UI: 32.1 to 50.1 million) currently
affected in 2019 (Supplemental Figure 17A). Deaths
decreased until 2012 but have stabilized since then
and even started increasing since 2017 (306,000 [95%
UI: 259,000 to 340,000] in 2019). DALYs and YLLs
have slowly decreased to 10.7 million (95% UI: 9.21 to
12.1 million) and 8.68 million (95% UI: 7.43 to 9.77
million), respectively, in 2019, whereas YLDs have
increased
to
1.99
million
(95%
UI:
1.20
to
3.04 million).
Age-standardized rates for RHD prevalence have
closely tracked with all-age rates, but age-standard-
ized mortality has exceeded all-age mortality until the
past few years, highlighting the differential mortality
risk due to RHD observed in regions with differing age
structures and levels of development (Supplemental
Figure 17B). The narrowing of this differential tells a
positive story about RHD care, although the domi-
nance of China and India in the overall ﬁgures may
mask persistent differentials in other high-prevalence
countries and regions. The continuing increase in
prevalence cannot be attributed to changes in age
structure but likely reﬂects increased global aware-
ness, the increasing availability of echocardiography
for case deﬁnition, improved survival in some places,
and the chronic nature of RHD.
Globally, the prevalence of RHD is estimated to
peak between 20 and 29 years, remain relatively sta-
ble until 40 years, and then begin a steady decline,
likely reﬂecting decreasing survival at older ages. Sex
distribution is equal until the age of 15 years, after
which women bear a higher burden in terms of
prevalence across nearly all world regions. Higher
rates
of
RHD
in
post-pubertal
females
are
well
described, but incompletely understood, and may
reﬂect the interaction of biological, social, and envi-
ronmental risk factors.
RHD burden continues to show substantial global
heterogeneity (Supplemental Figure 18). The highest
age-standardized DALY rates are seen in Oceania and

the
highest-income
regions
(<25

Furthermore, although some regions have shown
large declines between 1990 and 2019 (Eastern and
Central Europe, East Asia, Central Latin America,
high-income Asia Paciﬁc, and North Africa and the
Middle East), there are also regions with only modest
improvements
and
regions
where
very
little
improvement has been seen (Oceania, South Asia, the
Caribbean, and sub-Saharan Africa). There is also
substantial within-region national and subnational
variability in RHD DALYs, some examples of which
include substantially higher RHD DALYs in Guyana
and Haiti compared to the rest of Latin America and
the Caribbean and the heterogeneity seen in the
subnational data on RHD DALYs from India (Figure 6).
RHD burden is highest among the world’s most
disadvantaged populations. The most marginalized
and poorest populations regionally, nationally, and at
a
subnational

Global RHD Resolution with increased multisector
investment in primary health care, improved sanita-
tion and housing, infrastructure, secure medication

vention and management, and tertiary capacity to
care for patients at the severe end of the RHD spec-
trum. RHD burden could be greatly decreased with an
effective group A streptococcal vaccine, with several
promising candidates currently in development (17).
Future data collection is needed at subnational levels
to identify and monitor populations with ongoing
high RHD burdens.
CARDIOMYOPATHY AND MYOCARDITIS. DALYs due
to cardiomyopathy and myocarditis have increased
from 7.06 million (95% UI: 6.30 to 8.63 million) to 9.14
million (95% UI: 7.86 to 10.0 million) over the past 30
years, a pattern that is also seen in the rise of deaths
from 238,000 (95% UI: 212,000 to 257,000) to 340,000
(95%
UI:
285,000
to
371,000)
(Supplemental
Figure 19A). However, over the same period, the
age-standardized rate of death has decreased from
8.0 per 100,000 (95% UI: 6.4 to 8.6 per 100,000) to 5.6

per 100,000 (95% UI: 4.5 to 6.3 per 100,000) in men
and 5.8 per 100,000 (95% UI: 4.4 to 6.4 per 100,000)
to 3.3 per 100,000 (95% UI: 2.7 to 3.6 per 100,000) in
women. The age-standardized morbidity and mor-
tality for men and women in 2019 remains different,
at 6.5 per 100,000 YLDs (95% UI: 4.3 to 9.3 per
100,000 YLDs) and 4.2 per 100,000 YLDs (95% UI: 2.8
to 6.0 per 100,000 YLDs) and 148.9 per 100,000 YLLs
(95% UI: 120.2 to 168.7 per 100,000 YLLs) and 71.4
per 100,000 YLLs (95% UI: 61.0 to 79.9 per 100,000
YLLs), respectively.
The prevalence and related mortality of cardio-
myopathy
and
myocarditis
increase
throughout
adulthood in both sexes, with a larger proportion of
cases in men than in women. When myocarditis alone
is considered, a similar trend was observed. Referring
to
2019,
in
the
age
between
35
and
39
years,
when myocarditis can commonly occur (18,19), the
rate of myocarditis is 6.1 per 100,000 (95% UI: 4.2
to 8.7 per 100,000) in men and 4.4 per 100,000 (95%
UI: 3.0 to 6.3 per 100,000) in women. Similar ﬁgures
can be found in the range of ages between 20 and 44
years.
The increased prevalence associated with aging is
more
pronounced
in
cardiomyopathies
than
in
myocarditis.
Approximately
a
6-fold
higher
age-
related
increase
of
other
cardiomyopathy
was
observed in men between 35 and 39 years (10.8 per
100,000 [95% UI: 6.5 to 17.4 per 100,000]) versus
those between 80 and 84 years (698.5 per 100,000
[95% UI: 429.6 to 1064.8 per 100,000]) compared with
myocarditis in men of 35 to 39 years (6.1 per 100,000
[95% UI: 4.2 to 8.7 per 100,00]) versus those of 80 to
84 years (63.0 per 100,000 [95% UI: 43.6 to 87.9 per
100,000]). The relatively greater rise of other cardio-
myopathy compared to myocarditis prevalence with
age is constant, from 1990 to 2019.
Myocarditis-related
mortality
rate
between
35
and 39 years was 0.2 per 100,000 (95% UI: 0.2 to
0.3
per
100,000)
in
men
compared
to
0.1
per
100,000 (95% UI: 0.1 to 0.2 per 100,000) in women
in 2019. Alternatively, myocarditis resulted in death
in 1 in 72 men (585 deaths per 42,200 incident
cases) and 1 in 87 (324 deaths per 28,100 incident
cases) women in this age bracket who were diag-
nosed in 2019. Between ages 80 and 84 years, the
rate was higher, at 1 death for every 19 incident
cases
of
myocarditis
in
men
(1,800
deaths
per
34,400
incident
cases)
and
1
death
for
every
15 incident cases of myocarditis in women (2,260
deaths per 34,900 incident cases).
Marked regional variations in other cardiomyopa-
thy in age-standardized DALYs in both sexes were
observed in 2019 (Supplemental Figure 20). These
ranged from 5 to 46 DALYs per 100,000 in South Asia,
East Asia, Andean Latin America, high-income Asia
Paciﬁc, and Central Latin America to 96 to 147 per
100,000
in
Oceania,
the
Caribbean,
high-income
North
America,
and
Western
and
Eastern
sub-
Saharan Africa to 230 to 271 per 100,000 in Central
Asia, Eastern Europe, and Southern and Central sub-
Saharan Africa. These regional variations may be
explained by a higher prevalence of peripartum car-
diomyopathy in Africa, Chagas disease in Central and
South America, and alcohol-related cardiomyopathy
in parts of Central Europe and Russia (20).
Although the morbidity and mortality rates from
cardiomyopathies and myocarditis collectively pre-
sent a substantial global disease burden in 2019, the
regional differences in the burden (Figure 7) suggest
that public health interventions should be tailored to
the speciﬁc etiologies of cardiomyopathy to lower
these rates in the future.
ALCOHOLIC CARDIOMYOPATHY. The global preva-
lence of alcoholic cardiomyopathy (AC) estimated by
GBD 2019 was 708,000 cases (95% UI: 545,000 to
924,000 cases), approximately 9.1 cases per 100,000
(95% UI: 7.0 to 11.9 cases per 100,000) (Supplemental
Figure 21A). Globally, AC was responsible for 71,700
deaths (95%
UI: 60,200 to
82,000 deaths), 2.38
million YLLs (95% UI: 2.00 to 2.73 million YLLs), and
60,100 YLDs (95% UI: 38,500 to 88,300 YLDs). The
total number of DALYs due to AC was 2.44 million
(95% UI: 2.05 to 2.78 million). After a rapid increase
from
1999,
DALYs,
deaths,
and
YLLs
started
decreasing from 2005 to 2019. The global prevalence
and YLDs due to AC are increasing.
All-age
and
age-standardized
rates
of
DALYs,
deaths, prevalent cases, YLDs, and YLLs declined
from 2005 to 2019 (Supplemental Figure 21B). This
indicates that the global increase in AC prevalence is
related, in part, to population growth and aging.
Several countries in East Asia and the Caribbean re-
gions
showed
opposite
trends,
with
increasing
age-standardized values for almost all indicators.
Factors that might explain these regional differences
remain incompletely understood.
At the global level, substantially more total DALYs
due to AC were experienced by men than women.
DALYs from AC rose rapidly among men beginning
from age 25 years, being signiﬁcantly higher in men
than
women
across
all
ages
(Supplemental
Figure 22). Women are generally considered more
susceptible to alcohol-induced damages than men,
which may reﬂect sex-speciﬁc differences in alcohol
consumption,
type,
blood
level,
distribution,
or
metabolism. However, the higher level of alcohol

consumption and the higher frequency of alcohol
problems among men could justify the observed
higher rate of DALYs.
Age-standardized DALYs due to AC were higher in
Central Europe as well as in the Caribbean (Cuba),
followed by Australasia, North America, Central Asia,
Western
Europe,
and
tropical
Latin
America
(Figure 8). Extremely high rates were seen in Eastern
Europe, particularly in Russia and Kyrgyzstan. The
lowest levels were observed in sub-Saharan Africa,
Andean Latin America, and North Africa and the
Middle East. Geographic differences reﬂect drinking
patterns among regions, for example, rates of binge
drinking, as well as social and cultural behaviors,
such as abstaining from alcohol.
AC represents substantial morbidity and mortality
among young and middle-age people, particularly
men. The age-standardized DALYs are high in several
countries, and the true burden of disease could be
underestimated
because
alcohol
consumption
is
often underreported (21). Additional policy support
for public education and awareness is needed to
reduce the harmful use of alcohol. Because alcohol
negatively affects cardiovascular function, increased
clinician emphasis on eliminating alcohol use among
people with coexisting CVD is advisable. Research
should be aimed at understanding the exact mecha-
nisms of disease, susceptibility to alcohol damage,
effective public health interventions, and treatments
for AC.
AF AND AFL. The total number of DALYs due to AF
and AFL increased progressively from 3.79 million
(95% UI: 2.96 to 4.83 million) in 1990 to 8.39 million
(95% UI: 6.69 to 10.5 million) in 2019 (Supplemental
Figure 23A). GBD 2019 estimated 59.7 million (95%
UI: 45.7 to 75.3 million) prevalent cases of AF/AFL in
2019, about a doubling compared to the prevalent
cases in 1990.
When standardized for age, prevalence of AF/AFL,
DALYS, and death rates did not display marked
changes
between
1990
and
2019
(Supplemental
Figure 23B). The age-standardized AF/AFL preva-
lence rate was 775.9 per 100,000 (95% UI: 592.4 to
990.8 per 100,000) in 1990 and 743.5 per 100,000
(95% UI: 571.2 to 938.3 per 100,000) in 2019. Age-
standardized rates for DALYs did not change sub-
stantially between 1990, when they were 110.0 per
100,000 (95% UI: 87.7 to 139.2 per 100,000), to 2019,

when they were 107.1 per 100,000 (95% UI: 86.2 to
133.7 per 100,000). Similarly, the age-standardized
death rates per 100,000 were similar in 1990 at 4.3
per 100,000 (95% UI: 3.7 to 5.1 per 100,000) and 4.4
per 100,000 (95% UI: 3.7 to 5.0 per 100,000).
Comparing total numbers with age-standardized
numbers suggests that global increases in AF/AFL
are largely attributable to aging of the population and
population growth.
Globally, under the age of 70 years, more total
DALYs due to AF were experienced by men than
women (Supplemental Figure 24). Between 70 and 74
years, men and women had similar DALYs. However,
at age 75 years and older, this trend was reversed,
with
higher
total
DALYs
experienced
by
women. These trends were observed in 1990 as well
as 2019. These ﬁndings point toward sex-speciﬁc,
age-related targets for the prevention and manage-
ment of AF/AFL.
Age-standardized DALY rates due to AF/AFL were
highest in high-income North America, Australasia,
Central Asia, and Europe and were observed to be
lowest
in
the
high-income
Asia
Paciﬁc
region
(Figure 9). Also, Andean and Central Latin America,
the Caribbean, sub-Saharan Africa, and North Africa
and the Middle East displayed low rates. However,
because of a general lack of data from these regions,
more detailed studies should be performed. The
reasons for this signiﬁcant regional variation may
include
increased
ascertainment
in
high-income
regions, differential control of risk factors, and ge-
netic factors. A detailed comparison of potential
differentiating features between highest DALY rate
versus lowest DALY rate regions could yield valuable
additional information.
AF/AFL are the most common arrhythmias and
continue
to
make
a
progressive
and
substantial
impact on public health at a global level. In most
regions, prevalence rates are increasing, suggesting
that more effort is needed to improve prevention
and health care for AF/AFL at a global level. Health
systems and countries will need to focus their ef-
forts to reverse these trends by aggressive attention
to the reduction of risk factors such as hyperten-
sion, diabetes, and obesity; better treatment of in-
dividuals with IHD and heart failure; and improved
access
to
medications
for
thromboembolism
prophylaxis.

AORTIC ANEURYSM. The total number of YLLs due
to aortic
aneurysm, including both thoracic
and
abdominal types, has increased steadily since 1990,
reaching 3.32 million YLLs (95% UI: 3.11 to 3.52 million
YLLs) and 172,000 deaths (95% UI: 157,000 to 183,000
deaths) in 2019 (Figure 10A).
Age-standardized
rates
for
YLLs
and
deaths
declined over this period, indicating that, overall,
global increases in aortic aneurysm have been due to
population growth and aging (Figure 10B). This likely
reﬂects improvement in diagnosis and treatment of
risk factors.
At the global level, men bore a substantially higher
burden of YLLs due to aortic aneurysm compared with
women. YLLs from aortic aneurysm rose most steeply
in the sixth decade of life for men, peaking by age 70
years (Supplemental Figure 25). Women younger than
age 75 years accounted for less than one-half of YLLs
due to aortic aneurysm. The gap between men and
women narrowed with increasing age, with YLLs in
women overtaking those of men at age 90 years. This
could be explained by the generally longer lifespan of
women compared with men. Despite the lower preva-
lence of abdominal aortic aneurysm than men, growth
rate in women has been shown to be more rapid,
rupture during surveillance 4 times more likely, and
likelihood of fatal rupture 3 times as high, even after
adjustment for age (22–24). For thoracic aortic aneu-
rysms, women have a lower incidence but are more
likely to have fatal consequences than men (25).
Age-standardized YLLs due to aortic aneurysm
were highest in Eastern and Central Europe as well as
Southern and Tropical Latin America, with extremely
high levels noted in Montenegro and parts of Brazil
(Supplemental Figure 26). The lowest levels were
observed in Andean Latin America, North Africa and
the Middle East, and East Asia, including Mexico,
Iraq, and China. Risk factors, including tobacco use
and hypertension, as well as access to screening and
preventive health care, may partially explain these
patterns.
Aortic aneurysm remains a major public health
issue, with the overall burden in terms of number of
YLLs and deaths increasing globally. Because age-
standardized rates for YLLs and death due to aortic
aneurysm declined from 1990 to 2019, the increase
may be attributable to population growth and aging.
However, because the risk factors for this disease

remain common, most national health systems will
need to address increasing demand for preventive
care, including low-cost screening modalities for
abdominal aneurysms in the high-burden regions
mentioned earlier. The risk factors underlying the
development of aortic aneurysm are common to other
CVDs, such as IHD. As such, investing health system
resources in these risk factors, including hyperten-
sion
management
and
smoking
cessation,
could
reduce the burden of other diseases in addition to
aortic aneurysm. Combined with implementation of
inexpensive screening technology, such as ultraso-
nography, where indicated, the morbidity and mor-
tality due to aortic aneurysm can be signiﬁcantly
decreased globally.
NONRHEUMATIC
VALVULAR
HEART
DISEASE:
CALCIFIC AORTIC VALVE DISEASE. Calciﬁc aortic
valve disease (CAVD) occurs commonly among older
adults with a normal trileaﬂet aortic valve and with a
greater frequency among those with a congenital
bicuspid aortic valve. CAVD is clinically important
because severe obstruction causes symptoms and left
ventricular dysfunction warranting surgical or trans-
catheter valve replacement (26). The prevalence of
CAVD increases with age and is >1,000 per 100,000
beyond the age of 75 years.
Globally,
both
the
prevalence
and

standardized prevalence of CAVD have increased

prevalence rose to approximately 116.3 cases per
100,000 (95% UI: 100.4 to 134.5 cases per 100,000)
people, from about 45.5 cases per 100,000 (95% UI:
37.6 to 54.7 cases per 100,000) people in 1990. This
increase may be attributable to increased prevalence
of atherosclerotic risk factors associated with the
development and progression of CAVD (27). Although
age-standardized YLDs due to CAVD have increased
in parallel with prevalence, there has been no sig-
niﬁcant change in age-standardized DALYs, most
likely because most of the DALYs due to CAVD accrue
from YLLs, whereas deaths due to CAVD (and conse-
quently, age-standardized YLLs) have not increased
over the years. The ready availability of aortic valve
replacement in regions of the world where CAVD is
most
prevalent
may
be
an
important
check
on
mortality.
In HICs, the age-standardized prevalence of CAVD
is similar among both men and women, while the
prevalence among men exceeds that among women
to varying degrees in the other regions of the world.
Population-based studies of the prevalence of non-
rheumatic valvular heart disease remain rare, and
further research is needed to understand if sex dif-
ferences in prevalence are due to differences in dis-
ease burden, health-seeking behavior, or rates of
diagnosis.
There is substantial heterogeneity among coun-
tries in age-standardized prevalence and DALYs due
to CAVD (Figure 11). Prevalence is low (<20 per
100,000) in several regions of the world, notably,
sub-Saharan Africa (excluding the south), most of Asia
(including South and Southeast Asia), North Africa and
the Middle East, and Oceania. In contrast, age-
standardized prevalence is much higher (>200 per
100,000) in Australasia; high-income Asia Paciﬁc and
North America; and Central, Eastern, and Western
Europe. The difference may reﬂect higher prevalence

of other competing illnesses and lack of testing for
CAVD in LMICs. Despite the low prevalence of CAVD in
LMICs, DALYs due to CAVD are disproportionately
high, possibly reﬂecting the limited access to timely
aortic valve replacement (28).
As populations age, CAVD becomes an increasingly
important cause of morbidity and mortality. The in-
crease in reported prevalence of CAVD may be a
consequence of both an increase in the prevalence of
risk
factors
for
atherosclerosis and an
increased
awareness
and
investigation
to
detect
disease.
Although major advances have been made in the
treatment of end-stage CAVD, research on ways to
prevent the onset and progression of disease requires
additional investments. In the populous regions of
the world such as South Asia and Africa, despite the
low prevalence of CAVD, the absolute number of
people with CAVD is large. Countries will need to
invest
in
health
care
infrastructure
and
health
workers to provide timely valve interventions for
these
patients
to
reduce
related
morbidity
and
mortality.
NONRHEUMATIC
VALVULAR
HEART
DISEASE:
DEGENERATIVE MITRAL VALVE DISEASE. The major
cause of nonrheumatic degenerative mitral valve
(MV) disease is MV prolapse (29,30). Untreated, this
can lead to chronic mitral regurgitation, AF, and heart
failure (31). The total number of DALYs due to
degenerative MV disease has increased since 1990
and
is
responsible
for
883,000
DALYs
(95%
UI:
754,000 to 1,090,000 DALYs) and 34,200 deaths (95%
UI: 28,300 to 43,300 deaths) in 2019 (Supplemental
Figure 28A). GBD 2019 estimated 24.2 million (95%
UI: 23.1 to 25.4 million) prevalent cases of degenera-
tive MV disease in 2019.
Age-standardized rates for DALYs, deaths, and
prevalent cases of degenerative MV disease declined
over this time period, suggesting that the global in-
creases in MV disease have been due to population
growth and aging (Supplemental Figure 28B). The
regions
with
the
largest
reductions
in
age-
standardized DALYs between 1990 and 2019 are
high-income Asia Paciﬁc, North Africa and the Middle
East, and Australasia. However, for some regions—for
example, in Eastern Europe and Central Asia—age-
standardized rates have not declined.
At the global level, substantially more total DALYs
due to MV disease were experienced by women than
men. For almost all age groups, MV disease DALYs
were higher in women than men (Figure 12). Globally,
women and men had similar DALYs in the 40- to 44-
year age groups, but the levels diverged after age 65
years, when women had more than one-third more
DALYs due to MV disease than men, peaking at age 75
to 79 years. Prior studies have found that women with
severe regurgitation have higher mortality and lower
surgery rates than men, which may account for some
of the increased DALYs in older women (32).
Age-standardized DALYs due to MV disease were
highest for both men and women in Central Europe;
speciﬁcally, high rates were seen in Serbia, Bosnia
and Herzegovina, and Hungary, with the lowest
levels seen in Southeast Asia, East Asia, and Andean
Latin America (Supplemental Figure 29). Women had
higher DALYs than men in most regions except Cen-
tral Asia, Eastern Europe, Australasia, the Caribbean,
and
Western
sub-Saharan
Africa
(Supplemental
Figure 30).
Degenerative MV disease continues to be a major
threat to public health, and the overall burden in
terms of number of DALYs, deaths, and prevalent
cases is increasing globally. Prevention of MV disease
through reduction in risk factors remains a key public
health issue. In addition, given an aging population in
many
regions,
health
systems
should
focus
on
improving access to diagnostic imaging (i.e., echo-
cardiography) and subspecialty care for close follow-
up. Improved access to surgical and percutaneous
interventions is also needed to decrease mortality
and long-term sequelae and improve quality of life for
those with MV disease (33).
ENDOCARDITIS. The total number of DALYs due to
endocarditis has risen steadily since 1990, reaching
1.72 million (95% UI: 1.36 to 1.94 million) DALYs and
66,300 deaths (95% UI: 46,200 to 75,900 deaths) in
2019 (Figure 13A). GBD 2019 estimated 1.09 million
(95% UI: 0.913 to 1.30 million) incident cases of
endocarditis in 2019.
Age-standardized rates show an increase in inci-
dence, from 9.9 per 100,000 (95% UI: 8.2 to 11.8 per
100,000) to 13.8 per 100,000 (95% UI: 11.6 to 16.3 per
100,000), as well as deaths, from 0.7 per 100,000
(95% UI: 0.6 to 0.9 per 100,000) to 0.9 per 100,000
(95% UI: 0.6 to 1.0 per 100,000) (Figure 13B). Although
there has been a slight increase in the DALYs, YLLs,
and YLDs caused by endocarditis across all ages, once
standardized for age structure and growth, these
metrics are largely static between 1990 and 2019. The
increase in death may be explained by an increasing
proportion of endocarditis caused by virulent organ-
isms such as staphylococci or complex infection in
patients not ﬁt for surgical intervention.
At the global level, more total DALYs due to
endocarditis were experienced by men than women
in 2019 (973,000 DALYs [95% UI: 736,000 to 1,120,000
DALYs] versus 751,000 DALYs [95% UI: 537,000 to

DALYs]).
DALYs
from
endocarditis
rose
rapidly for both sexes from birth and reached a peak
at age 55 to 59 years for men and age 65 to 69 years
for women (Supplemental Figure 31). Women ages
75 years and older had more DALYs due to endo-
carditis than men in the same age group.
There
is
wide
variation
in
the
regional
age-
standardized
DALY
rate
due
to
endocarditis
(Supplemental Figures 32 and 33). In 2019, the highest
rates were seen in Oceania, with 44.9 DALYs per
100,000 (95% UI: 30.7 to 60.7 DALYs per 100,000)
(across men and women), followed by Southern Latin
America (40.1 DALYs per 100,000 [95% UI: 32.7 to
49.6 DALYs per 100,000]) and Southeast Asia (38.6
DALYs per 100,000 [95% UI: 31.6 to 53.8 DALYs per
100,000]). There were also high rates in Eastern
Europe (especially in men), the Caribbean, Tropical
Latin America, and Africa. The lowest DALYs for
endocarditis were seen in Central and East Asia. In
large part, areas with high age-standardized DALY
rates for endocarditis mirror those areas with a high
prevalence of RHD, for example, in Oceania, South-
east Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa.
The epidemiology of endocarditis, including pre-
disposing conditions, is heterogeneous. Therefore, it is
not surprising that the endocarditis-associated YLDs
and DALYs vary considerably by location. Both the
endocarditis-associated YLDs and DALYs increased in
76.2% and 52.4% of locations, respectively. Staphylo-
coccus aureus has become the predominant endo-
carditis pathogen in many areas of the world and is
extremely virulent and a well-recognized marker of
worse outcomes (34). As a result, mounting human and
health care burdens mandate that an individualized
approach be developed for each location to better un-
derstand the unique epidemiology of endocarditis so
that efforts can be focused on management and pre-
vention of this life-threatening condition.

PERIPHERAL ARTERY DISEASE. The global numbers
of prevalent cases and deaths due to PAD have risen
consistently each year since 1990, resulting in a 2-fold
increase to 113 million cases (95% UI: 99.2 to 128
million cases) and 74,100 deaths (95% UI: 41,200 to
128,000 deaths) in 2019 (Supplemental Figure 34A).
Comparable trends in DALYs, YLLs, and YLDs have
resulted in 1.54 million (95% UI: 1.01 to 2.37 million),
1.04 million (95% UI: 0.604 to 1.78 million), and
501,000
(95%
UI:
235,000
to
898,000)
respec-
tively in 2019.
In keeping with the increase in numbers of preva-
lent cases, deaths, DALYS, YLLs, and YLDs, rates per
100,000 persons of all ages increased between 1990
and 2019 (Supplemental Figure 34B). The trends in
age-standardized rates of deaths and YLLs were ﬂat
from 1990 to 2019, and prevalence, YLDs, and DALYs
declined slightly. Overall, the PAD prevalence in-
crease reﬂects population growth rather than a major
change in age-speciﬁc incidence. In both 1990 and
2019, cross-sectional analyses show that the numbers
of prevalent cases increased with age in both men and
women up to 70 years of age and prevalence rates
increased
throughout
the
whole
age
spectrum.
Numbers and rates of cases were higher in women
than men at all ages. Deaths and DALYs showed in-
creases with age comparable to prevalence except
that deaths and DALYs were higher in men than
women up to very old age.
The numbers of prevalent cases increased in both
men and women at all ages by up to 2-fold since 1990,
but age-standardized prevalence rates were slightly
lower in 2019 than in 1990. Numbers of deaths and
DALYs were higher in 2019 compared to 1990 in both
men and women at all ages, but over the same period,
age-standardized death rates remained much the
same, and DALY rates fell slightly.
Age-standardized DALY rates varied by world re-
gion in 2019 (Figure 14). Higher rates (>25 per 100,000
persons) were found in both men and women in
Europe (western, central, and eastern), North Amer-
ica, Australasia, the Caribbean, and sub-Saharan Af-
rica (central, eastern, and southern) (Supplemental
Figure 35). Especially high rates occurred in men in
Eastern Europe and areas of sub-Saharan Africa.
Lowest DALY rates were found in Asia, Andean

countries, West and North Africa and the Middle East.
The pattern was similar in men and women, with
most regions showing higher rates in men, but in re-
gions with low overall rates, the sex differences were
small. The burden of PAD is increasing not only in
developed HICs but also in LMICs, where concomitant
risk
factors
such
as
diabetes
and
obesity
are
increasing.
Despite decreases in PAD age-standardized preva-
lence, deaths, DALYs, YLDs, and YLLs, overall rates
have increased because of worldwide increases in life
expectancy. High DALY rates of PAD in Eastern
Europe and parts of Africa, particularly in men,
require investigation. PAD is highly prevalent and is
both underrecognized and inadequately studied.
MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS
HIGH SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE. With aging of
the population and population growth, the number of
adults worldwide affected by high systolic blood
pressure (SBP) increased from 2.18 billion (95% UI:
95% UI: 2.11 to 2.26 billion) to 4.06 billion (95% UI:
3.96 to 4.15 billion) from 1990 to 2019 (Supplemental
Table 1). High SBP is deﬁned by GBD 2019 according
to
a
theoretical
minimum
risk
exposure
level
(TMREL) of $110 to 115 mm Hg, which is the level of
exposure that minimizes risk at the population level.
In 2019, there were 828 million (95% UI: 768 to 888
million) adults with SBP >140 mm Hg, a common
threshold for treatment with pharmacotherapies. The
prevalence
of
adults
worldwide
with
high
SBP
increased from 84,481.1 per 100,000 persons (95% UI:
81,641.5 to 87,579.2 per 100,000 persons) in 1990 to
88,971.1 per 100,000 persons (95% UI: 86,950.0 to
91,028.8 per 100,000 persons) in 2019.
From 1990 to 2019, the total number of DALYs due
to high SBP increased from 154 million (95% UI: 139 to
169 million) to 235 million (95% UI: 211 to 261 million)
(Supplemental Figure 36A). Additionally, between
1990 and 2019, the number of deaths (6.79 million
[95% UI: 6.07 to 7.50 million] to 10.8 million [95% UI:
9.51 to 12.1 million]), YLDs (10.1 million [95% UI: 7.30
to 13.1 million] to 21.2 million [95% UI: 15.2 to 27.2
million]), and YLLs (144 million [95% UI: 129 to 158
million] to 214 million [95% UI: 191 to 237 million])
attributed
to
high
SBP
increased.
The
age-
standardized
rates
of
DALYs,
deaths,
and
YLLs
attributed to high SBP declined from 1990 to 2019,
whereas the age-standardized rate of YLDs did not
change
substantially
over
this
time
period
(Supplemental Figure 36B). These data indicate that
the increases in total number of disease events can be
attributed to population growth and aging. However,
in
some
regions—for
example,
Oceania—the
age-
standardized
rates
of
DALYs,
deaths,
YLDs,
and
YLLs increased between 1990 and 2019.
Globally, DALYs due to high SBP in 2019 were
higher among men compared with women from ages
15 to 19 through 70 to 74 years, but higher among
women compared to men in those 80 to 84 years or
older
(Figure
15).
Age-standardized
DALYs
were
higher among men compared with women in all re-
gions of the world (Supplemental Figure 37).
In 2019, there was an approximately 8-fold varia-
tion
across
regions
in
age-standardized
DALYs
attributed to high SBP (Supplemental Figure 38).
Rates of DALYs were lowest for both women and men
in the high-income Asia Paciﬁc region and highest in
Central Asia. Marked variation was also noted for
rates of death, YLLs, and YLDs. The highest age-
standardized rates of death and YLLs were noted in
Central Asia and Eastern Europe among men and
in Central Asia, North Africa and the Middle East, and
Central
sub-Saharan
Africa
among
women.
The
highest rate of YLDs was noted in Central Asia, Cen-
tral Europe, and Southeast Asia for men and in North
Africa and the Middle East, East Asia, and Southeast
Asia for women.
High
SBP
is
a
major
public
health
challenge,
affecting approximately 9 of 10 adults worldwide,
and is associated with high rates of DALYs, death,
YLDs, and YLLs. High SBP and its adverse health
consequences can be prevented by eating a heart-
healthy diet that includes <1 teaspoon of salt per
day and adequate potassium from fruits and vege-
tables,
maintaining
a
normal
weight,
increasing
physical activity, and avoiding unhealthy alcohol
intake (35).
HIGH FASTING PLASMA GLUCOSE. There are large
differences between and within countries in the
burden of high fasting plasma glucose, deﬁned as
above the TMREL of 4.8 to 5.4 mmol/l. The ﬁndings
showed
little
improvement
in
age-standardized
mortality rates from high fasting plasma glucose and
signiﬁcant increases in age-standardized YLDs be-
tween 1990 and 2019. Age-standardized mortality due
to high fasting plasma glucose actually increased
from 1990 to 2005, with a downward trend thereafter.
Between 1990 and 2019, a total of 134 million (95%
UI: 107 to 171 million) deaths due to high fasting
plasma glucose were recorded globally. The number
of deaths increased from 2.91 million (95% UI: 2.34 to
3.75 million) in 1990 to 6.50 million (95% UI: 5.11 to
8.36
million)
in
2019
(Figure

plasma glucose increased between 1990 and 2005
from 84.2 per 100,000 deaths (95% UI: 65.9 to 111.1
per 100,000 deaths) to 89.2 per 100,000 deaths (95%
UI: 70.2 to 115.9 per 100,000 deaths) then declined
to 83.0 per 100,000 deaths (95% UI: 64.5 to 107.1 per
100,000
deaths)
in
2019
(Figure
16B).
Age-
standardized
DALYs
followed
the
same
patterns
with a peak in 2005 and then a decline until 2019. In
contrast, age-standardized DALY rates were higher in
2019 at 2,104.3 per 100,000 (95% UI: 1,740.7 to 2,520.7
per 100,000) than in 1990 at 1,959.6 per 100,000 (95%
UI: 1,638.7 to 2,362.4 per 100,000). Of course, this is
the result of a sharp increase in age-standardized
YLDs from 1990 to 2019. Men had higher DALY
burden than women throughout the study period
until the age of 80 years, after which women had a
higher number of DALYs (Supplemental Figure 39).
DALYs due to high fasting plasma glucose increased
with age, peaked at 70 years, and then declined.
Age-standardized
DALYs
due
to
high
fasting
plasma glucose were higher in Oceania, followed by
Central Asia (Supplemental Figure 40). There were
large variations between countries in high fasting
plasma glucose DALY burden, with notably high rates
in
Uzbekistan,
Afghanistan,
Papua
New
Guinea,
Egypt, and Oman (Supplemental Figure 41). The
highest
age-standardized
DALYs
in
2019
were
observed in Kiribati at 12,255.2 per 100,000 (95% UI:
9,799.7 to 15,073.0 per 100,000), and the highest age-
standardized
death
rates
were
also
observed
in
Kiribati at 435.4 per 100,000 (95% UI: 347.0 to 540.5
per 100,000). Large variations were also observed
within countries. For example, the age-standardized
DALY rate varied in Brazil from 1,571.8 per 100,000
(95% UI: 1,293.6 to 1,909.1 per 100,000) in Minas
Gerais to 3,286.5 per 100,000 (95% UI: 2,735.5 to
3,907.3 per 100,000) in Alagoas, a 70.6% difference in
the country.

These
population-based
estimates
of
plasma
glucose level help track the global rise in diabetes.
GBD 2019 showed low rates of physical activity (LPA)
and poor diet in many countries. Both are major risk
factors for high fasting plasma glucose and have led
to caloric imbalance and higher rates of obesity,
which has rapidly increased globally since 1990 and
affects most geographic areas. There is a need to
develop and implement both public health policies
and clinical programs to reduce health disparities and
disease burden due to diabetes.
HIGH LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL.
The total number of DALYs due to high low-density
lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, deﬁned by a TMREL
of 0.7 to 1.3 mmol/l, has risen steadily since 1990,
reaching 98.6 million (95% UI: 80.3 to 119 million)
DALYs and 4.40 million (95% UI: 3.30 to 5.65 million)
deaths in 2019 (Supplemental Figure 42A). Over the
same period, the YLDs and YLLs rose to 5.71 million
(95% UI: 3.68 to 8.27 million) and 92.9 million (95%
UI: 75.6 to 111 million), respectively. This indicates
that the direction of the global trend for high LDL
is increasing.
Over the study period, the global all-age rates for
DALYs, deaths, and YLLs remained relatively static
and increased for YLDs (Supplemental Figure 42B).
During this time, the age-standardized rates for the
same measures all declined. This difference between
all-age rates and age-standardized rates suggests that
although the global burden of LDL-related disease
remains unacceptably high, on average, the observed
increases in the burden of DALYs in locations like
China and India have been driven primarily by pop-
ulation growth and aging. This trend is important for
global health because it implies that there has been at
least modest progress in reducing the burden of LDL-
related disease globally. Age-standardized DALY rates
attributable to elevated LDL cholesterol, however, are
estimated
to
be
increasing
in
some
locations,
including Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.
At the global level, signiﬁcantly more total DALYs
from elevated LDL were experienced by men than
women. LDL-related DALYs increased rapidly for men
beginning at age 30 years (Supplemental Figure 43).
Men ages 40 to 44 years had as many DALYs due to
LDL as women ages 60 to 64 and 80 to 84 years and
more than women in all other age groups. In aging
post-menopausal women, the LDL cholesterol levels
are comparable to those of men of similar age. The
difference in DALYs by sex and age suggests that the
burden of premature LDL-related disease in men
younger than 65 years may need focused public
health attention.
Age-standardized DALYs due to high LDL choles-
terol were highest in Eastern Europe, North Africa
and the Middle East, Oceania, and Central Asia
(Supplemental Figure 44). The lowest levels are pre-
sent in high-income Asia Paciﬁc, Australasia, Western
Europe, and Andean Latin America and, by country,
in the Republic of Korea, Japan, Rwanda, France,
Israel, and Spain (Figure 17). Potential explanations
for these differences in regional patterns include the
correspondingly LPA, increased high body mass index
(BMI), dietary patterns, and increased tobacco use in
the same regions and countries.
High LDL cholesterol remains a major threat to
public health, and the overall burden in terms of
number
of
DALYs,
deaths,
YLDs,
and
YLLs
is
increasing
globally.
In
some
locations,
the
risk
associated with high LDL cholesterol is especially
high and deserves immediate public health atten-
tion. Health systems and countries may need to
focus on new approaches that can reverse these
trends. These might include improved government
policies on diet and tobacco, school physical activity
programs,
and,
when
needed,
the
use
of
lipid-
lowering
therapy
in
keeping
with
contemporary
guidelines in which statins are the ﬁrst choice. More
global
investment
in
research
to
address
LDL
cholesterol–related knowledge and therapeutic gaps
is needed to address this persistent global health
threat.
HIGH BMI. Obesity, deﬁned by elevated BMI ($30 kg/
m2), has reached epidemic levels worldwide. Elevated
BMI worsens most of the CVD risk factors, including
adverse effects on blood pressure, blood sugar, lipids,
and inﬂammation and has adverse effects on cardiac
structure and function. Not surprisingly, hyperten-
sion, coronary heart disease, heart failure, and AF are
increased with obesity (36).
Globally, 5.02 million (95% UI: 3.22 to 7.11 million)
deaths and 160 million (95% UI: 106 to 219 million)
DALYs
were
attributed
to
high
BMI
in
2019
(Figure 18A). High BMI, deﬁned as above a TMREL of
20 to 25 kg/m2 for adults and above normal weight for
children, contributed to more YLLs (119 million [95%
UI: 79.6 to 164 million]) than YLDs (40.9 million [95%
UI: 24.5 to 60.9 million]) in 2019. Globally, between
1990 and 2019, the absolute numbers of deaths
attributable to high BMI increased (2.20 million [95%
UI: 1.21 to 3.43 million] to 5.02 million [95% UI: 3.22 to
7.11 million]), as did DALYs (67.3 million [95% UI: 38.0
to 104 million] to 160 million [95% UI: 106 to 219
million]), YLDs (12.9 million [95% UI: 6.9 to 21.0
million]
to
40.9
million
[95%
UI:
24.5
to
60.9 million]), and YLLs (54.4 million [95% UI: 30.2 to

84.4 million] to 119 million [95% UI: 79.6 to 164
million]).
After standardization for population growth and
aging, rates of deaths attributable to high BMI have
increased only modestly from 1990 to 2019 (4.9% in-
crease [95% UI: –7.3% to 24.6%]), DALYs (18.0% [95%
UI: 2.2% to 42.3%]), and YLLs (8.3% [95% UI: –6.6% to
31.2%]), suggesting that population growth and aging
of the population have contributed substantially to
the global trends in obesity-associated burden of
disease
(Figure
18B).
YLDs
have
increased
more
sharply (60.2% [95% UI: 41.3% to 90.2%]) from 1990
to 2019. Since population growth and aging from 1990
account for much of the absolute increases attribut-
able to high BMI, the focus may need to be on stra-
tegies targeting prevention of weight gain at younger
ages to decrease the burden of all measures, including
YLDs.
Global DALYs attributable to high BMI are highest
between ages 45 and 75 years and are slightly higher
for men at younger and middle ages and for women at
older ages (Supplemental Figure 45).
Age-standardized DALY rates due to high BMI are
highest in Oceania, Central Asia, North Africa and the
Middle East, Southern sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern
Europe, Central Latin America, the Caribbean, and
Central Europe (Supplemental Figure 46). Among
countries, Japan has the lowest and Kiribati the
highest
age-standardized
DALYs
in
the
world
(Supplemental Figure 47). The global ﬁndings are
generally similar between men and women in most
regions, but age-standardized DALYs are notably
higher for men in Central Asia and Central and
Eastern Europe.
Great efforts are needed to promote the prevention
of obesity and its progression to more severe forms
(36). A multifactorial approach is required to promote
improving dietary quality, especially reductions in
simple sugars, complex carbohydrates, and total cal-
ories.
Community
prevention
programs,
like
the
Diabetes Prevention Program, duplicated in many
programs (37), are needed (36). Optimizing efforts to
promote physical activity and exercise training are
needed, as well as reductions in sedentary behavior

and
making
neighborhoods,
communities,
and
workplaces more suitable to allow for these healthier
lifestyle behaviors. Potential governmental involve-
ment, such as mandating caloric/nutrition menu la-
beling and regulation of food ingredients, as well as
controlling
advertisements
and
certain
forms
of
beverage and food item taxation, etc., could be
instituted. Governmental intervention was very suc-
cessful decades ago in the North Karelia Project in
Finland (36,38), and potentially, similar efforts could
be successful for obesity intervention worldwide.
Research is needed to identify effective methods of
health promotion that will reduce obesity and align
all allied health professions toward this important
goal (36).
IMPAIRED KIDNEY FUNCTION. GBD 2019 estimates
use the term chronic kidney disease (CKD) to refer to
the morbidity and mortality that can be directly
attributed to all stages of CKD and the term impaired
kidney function (IKF) to capture the additional risk of
CKD from other associated conditions such as CVD
and gout. The DALYs due to IKF nearly doubled from
1990 to 2019, reaching 76.5 million (95% UI: 67.8 to
86.3 million) DALYs and 3.16 million (95% UI: 2.72 to
3.62 million) deaths globally in 2019 (Supplemental
Figure 48A). The estimated global prevalence of
CKD is 9,011.9 per 100,000 (95% UI: 8,401.3 to 9,577.8
per 100,000) (697 million [95% UI: 650 to 741 million]
people), 41.1% (95% UI: 38.9% to 43.4%) higher than
in 1990 due to aging (Supplemental Figures 49A
and 49B).
Age-standardized
DALYs
due
to
IKF
declined
slightly from 1,024.1 DALYs per 100,000 people (95%
UI: 898.4 to 1,154.8 DALYs per 100,000 people) to
945.3 DALYs per 100,000 people (95% UI: 836.3 to
1,066.8 DALYs per 100,000 people) from 1990 to 2019
(Supplemental Figure 48B). This 7.7% (95% UI: –12.9%
to –2.4%) decline in DALYs lags behind the 39.3%
(95% UI: –43.5% to –34.9%) decline in DALYs for all
risk factors combined. The age-standardized rate per
100,000 people for YLDs from IKF increased from
115.9 (95% UI: 84.7 to 150.5) to 139.4 (95% UI: 101.8 to
181.8) from 1990 to 2019. Growth and aging of the
global population resulted in an increase in all un-
adjusted disease burden measures for IKF.
CKD and its consequences generally rise markedly
with age and are higher among men than women, but
trends over time were similar across age and sex
groups (Supplemental Figures 50 and 51).
Geographically, the highest age-standardized rates
of DALYs due to IKF are now seen in Central Latin
America, Central Asia, the Caribbean, North Africa
and the Middle East, Oceania, and Southeast Asia
(Figure 19). Men in Central Latin America have among
the highest age-standardized DALYs at 2,091.2 per
100,000
people
(95%
UI:
1,791.6
to
2,424.8
per
100,000 people), double the global rate and 60%
higher than in 1990 (Supplemental Figure 52), which
represents an epidemic of CKD of unknown origin
that appears to be common in coastal lowlands, with
repeated heat stress, pesticide, and heavy metal
exposure implicated as potential causes (39).
CKD is emerging as a growing global problem, with
marked growth related to the aging population. Age-
standardized DALYs for IKF have declined by only
7.7%, compared to 39.3% for all risk factors, and they
increased in Central and Andean Latin America, the
Caribbean, Central and Southeast Asia, Oceania, and
Southern sub-Saharan Africa. Much of CKD remains
undiagnosed and undertreated. Governments, health
systems, physicians, and patient attention are needed
to improve the diagnosis of CKD by measuring pro-
teinuria and estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate.
There is also a need for earlier markers of kidney
injury. Diabetes and hypertension are leading factors
for
CKD,
its
progression,
and
associated
risk.
Improving their prevention and control will reduce
the burden of CKD. Therapeutic options for CKD are
increasing
with
the
proven
beneﬁts
of
renin-
angiotensin
system
blockade
in
proteinuria
and
possibly sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors
and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. Trials are
underway to test prevention of kidney events in pa-
tients with CKD without diabetes. A combination of
population-based
public
health
measures
for
increased
CKD
recognition
and
awareness
and
improved therapies to reduce risk is needed to reduce
the burden of CKD.
AMBIENT
AND
HOUSEHOLD
AIR
POLLUTION. Air
pollution is the leading environmental risk factor for
global health and the fourth largest risk factor for
global mortality. Two main forms of air pollution
quantiﬁed in GBD 2019 contribute substantially to the
burden of CVD: ambient particulate matter with an
aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2.5 mm (PM2.5)
and household air pollution (HAP) from the use of
solid fuels for cooking. In 2019, CVD accounted for
51.5% and 30.5% of the total DALYS attributable to
PM2.5 and HAP, respectively.
Despite substantial reductions in ambient PM2.5
concentrations in North America and Europe, levels
remain high throughout most of the world (40).
Global annual average population-weighted PM2.5
levels increased slightly from 40.8 mg/m3 in 1990 to
42.6 mg/m3 in 2019. However, the global disease
burden attributable to ambient PM2.5 increased from

70.5 million (95% UI: 47.3 to 98.9 million) DALYs and
2.05 million (95% UI: 1.45 to 2.74 million) deaths in
1990 to 118 million (95% UI: 95.9 to 138 million)
DALYs and 4.14 million (95% UI: 3.45 to 4.80 million)
deaths,
respectively,
in
2019
(Supplemental
Figure 53A). Age-standardized rates for DALYs and
deaths attributable to PM2.5 have remained relatively
constant between 1990 and 2019, indicating that, on
average, global increases in attributable disease have
been due to population growth and aging, especially
in
locations
with
high
exposures
(Supplemental
Figure 53B). Age-standardized DALYs attributable to
PM2.5 were higher than the global mean in East,
Central, and South Asia; North Africa and the Middle
East; and Southern and Western sub-Saharan Africa
(Figure 20).
In contrast to ambient PM2.5, the burden attrib-
utable to HAP decreased sharply from 208 million
(95% UI: 162 to 259 million) DALYs and 4.36 million
(95% UI: 3.33 to 5.40 million) deaths in 1990 to 91.5
million (95% UI: 67.0 to 119 million) DALYs and 2.31
million (95% UI: 1.63 to 3.12 million) deaths in 2019
(Supplemental Figure 54A). Trends for both all-age
and
age-standardized
DALYs
and
death
rates
attributable
to
HAP
have
also
declined
sharply,
indicating
the
impact
of
exposure
reduction
(Supplemental
Figure
54B).
However,
age-
standardized rates of DALYs attributable to HAP
remain high throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa,
which
has
yet
to
experience
the
beneﬁts
of
improved access to clean household energy sources
seen in India, China, and much of Southeast Asia
(Supplemental
Figure
55).
The
highest
rates
of
DALYs for HAP were in Oceania; Eastern, Western
and Central sub-Saharan Africa; and South Asia,
driven by differences in exposure.
DALYs attributable to PM2.5 and HAP were higher
in men, driven by sex differences in rates of the dis-
eases
affected
by
air
pollution
(Supplemental
Figures 56 and 57). These sex differences were less
pronounced for HAP given that women tend to be
more highly exposed. DALYs attributable to HAP had
the largest impacts in infancy and early childhood,
whereas for PM2.5, it was between ages 30 and 90
years.
Increased attention to air pollution as a CVD risk
factor is warranted and will require concerted ac-
tion and collaboration between government health

and
environmental
agencies.
This
is
especially
relevant given high levels of exposure in many
parts of the world and links between PM2.5 and
health risks at levels substantially below those of
current regulatory levels (41). As demonstrated in
North
America
and
Western
Europe,
air
quality
management, coupled with regulation and enforce-
ment, is effective at reducing ambient air pollution
and
its
disease
burden
(42).
Similar
approaches
applied elsewhere, in combination with actions to
reduce emissions of climate-forcing agents will be
necessary.
In
the
interim,
personal-level
in-
terventions, such as the use of portable air cleaners,
may be effective (43). Continued reductions in HAP
exposure through programs to improve access to
clean energy sources will lead to both health and
climate beneﬁts (44).
TOBACCO. Tobacco,
including
primary
smoking,
secondhand smoke, and use of chewing tobacco,
accounted for 8.71 million (95% UI: 8.12 to 9.31
million) deaths and 230 million (95% UI: 213 to 246
million) DALYs in 2019 (Figure 21A). Of tobacco-
attributable deaths, 36.7% were due to CVD. The
number of YLLs attributable to tobacco (194 million
[95% UI: 180 to 209 million]) far exceeded the number
of attributable YLDs (36.1 million [95% UI: 27.0 to
46.0 million]), highlighting the outsized effect of to-
bacco on premature mortality.
Progress in reducing tobacco use and exposure has
not kept pace with competing demographic forces,
namely, population growth and population aging.
Population growth, particularly in countries with a
large population of tobacco users, has resulted in an
increasing number of tobacco-attributable deaths and
DALYs since 1990. When controlling for population
growth, decreases in both death and DALY rates are
observed. However, population aging has resulted in
smaller decreases in all-age rates compared to age-
standardized rates (Figure 21B). With approximately
80% of current smokers living in LMICs, these de-
mographic forces will continue to counter progress in
tobacco control for years to come.
In 2019, global smoking prevalence among men
was 33.5% (95% UI: 33.1% to 33.9%), and smoking
prevalence among women was 6.8% (95% UI: 6.6% to
7.0%). As a result of this difference, 75.4% of smoking
attributable deaths occurred among men. The age
pattern of tobacco use and exposure, combined with

the age distribution of associated health outcomes,
results in age-speciﬁc DALYs peaking among men
ages 60 to 64 years and among women ages 65 to 69
years (Supplemental Figure 58).
The highest age-standardized tobacco-attributable
DALY rates among men were observed in Eastern
Europe, Central Asia, and Oceania (Supplemental
Figure 59). Among women, the highest rates were
observed in Oceania, high-income North America,
and Central Europe. Thirty percent of all current
smokers
live
in
China,
and
nearly
one-third
of
tobacco-attributable
deaths
occurred
in
China
in 2019.
With more than 1 billion active tobacco users, the
tobacco epidemic remains a central challenge to
global health. The global disease burden of tobacco
use continues to increase, attributable in large part to
population growth and falling most heavily on LMICs,
where
the
large
majority
of
tobacco
users
live.
Effective tobacco control measures available to gov-
ernments
and
private
sector
institutions
include
policies that increase taxes on tobacco, fund mass
media education campaigns, ban tobacco marketing
and sponsorship, require prominent warning labels
on tobacco products, require environments to be
smoke-free, and ensure access to and delivery of to-
bacco cessation treatments in health care systems.
The evidence-based measures are included in the
World Health Organization’s Framework Convention
on Tobacco Control, a public health treaty that took
effect in 2005 and has been ratiﬁed by 182 countries.
Despite this global commitment, adoption of the
Framework Convention on Tobacco Control measures
has varied widely across countries. Increasing adop-
tion and effective implementation of evidence-based
tobacco control policies is a key worldwide public
health
priority.
Looking
ahead
toward
non-
communicable disease targets set in the Sustainable
Development Goals, accelerated progress in imple-
menting proven policies and interventions is neces-
sary
to
substantially
reduce
tobacco-attributable
burden.
DIETARY RISKS. In GBD 2019, dietary risks comprise
the sum of adverse effects of diets in which 15 food
types are either underconsumed (fruits, vegetables,
legumes, whole grains, nuts and seeds, milk, ﬁber,
calcium,
omega-3
fatty
acids
from
seafood,
and
polyunsaturated fatty acids) or overconsumed (red
meat, processed meat, sugar-sweetened beverages,
trans-fatty acids, and sodium).
CVDs are the primary consequence of these dietary
risks, with 7.94 million (95% UI: 6.47 to 9.76 million)
annual deaths and 188 million (95% UI: 156 to 225
million) annual DALYs attributed to dietary risks
(Figure 22A). Worldwide, the absolute disease burden
caused
by
dietary
risks
has
risen
for
30
years,
regardless of how measured. Over the same period,
age-standardized rates have fallen for most measures,
indicating the central role of population growth and
population
aging
on
the
observed
increases
(Figure 22B). The exception is age-standardized rates
of YLDs caused by dietary risks, which have grown in
both absolute and proportional terms.
Worldwide, the number of DALYs caused by di-
etary risks peaks between 55 and 70 years of age for
both men and women, with a large excess of DALYs
among men compared to women in every age group
to 80 years old (Supplemental Figure 60). Age-
standardized rates of DALYs caused by dietary risks
are highest in Central Asia, Oceania, and Eastern
Europe and lowest in Australasia, HICs of the Asia
Paciﬁc, and Western Europe (Supplemental Figures 61
and 62). Differences in age-standardized DALY rates
among populations reﬂect a complex interplay be-
tween variations in diet quality, levels of exposure to
different dietary risks, and access to interventions
targeting the downstream clinical effects of CVDs.
The detailed effects of many dietary risks are
poorly
understood
because
assessments
are
hampered by the challenges of accurately quantifying
exposures and separating the effects of each risk from
those of important covariates. However, the effects of
dietary risks on CVD remain large whether assessed as
individual dietary factors or measures of overall diet
quality, and there is little doubt about the importance
of dietary risks as a cause of global disease burden.
Strong commercial interests driving the sales of
unhealthy
foods
have
made
it
challenging
to
persuade policy makers, clinicians, or community
members to act decisively on diet quality. Easy access
to healthy fruits, vegetables, and whole grains re-
mains limited for much of the world. Many countries
have adopted policies to limit consumption of added
sugar, sodium, and harmful fats, but implementation
has mostly been weak, and the impact on global
health has been limited. Exceptions are regulatory
and ﬁscal interventions such as soda taxes and
beverage reformulation programs that have led to
lower intakes of added sugars, proving the feasibility
of determined intervention. Likewise, the removal of
artiﬁcial trans-fat from the food supply in the United
States
has
improved
diet
quality,
although
the
amount of trans-fat in the global food supply remains
high. Reliance on drug therapies targeting down-
stream metabolic risk factors caused by obesity may
be inadequate. Ill health caused by dietary risks is
anticipated to rise rapidly in LMICs over the coming

years, and behavioral and policy interventions suited
for implementation at scale in diverse settings around
the world are urgently required.
LOW PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. LPA is an important risk
factor for IHD, stroke, diabetes, breast and colon
cancers, and other noncommunicable diseases. The
combination of increased risk for important causes of
mortality and signiﬁcant levels of LPA in most coun-
tries has led to physical inactivity being characterized
as a pandemic. LPA is an important contributor of
premature mortality, morbidity, and DALYs for adults
in most of the world.
Globally, the total number of DALYs due to LPA,
deﬁned as <3,000 to 4,500 metabolic equivalent mi-
nutes per week, continuously increased from 8.61
million (95% UI: 4.28 to 15.9 million) in 1990 to 15.7
million
(95%
UI:
8.52
to
28.6
million)
in
2019
(Supplemental
Figure
63A).
A
linear
trend
was
observed in the numbers of deaths due to LPA, reach-
ing 832,000 premature deaths (95% UI: 427,000 to
1,470,000 premature deaths) in 2019. During the same
time period, the estimated YLLs grew steadily from
7.51 million (95% UI: 3.62 to 14.4 million) in 1990 to 12.7
million (95% UI: 6.58 to 23.8 million) YLLs in 2019.
Over time, the all-ages rate of DALYs, deaths, and
YLLs
due
to
LPA
has
increased,
and
the
age-
standardized
rate
has
decreased
(Supplemental
Figure 63B). This pattern reﬂects increased burden
due to growth and aging of the population, an effect
that is removed by age standardization.
Total global DALYs due to LPA were similar for men
and women until the 65- to 69-year age group, with
men consistently higher (Supplemental Figure 64).
This pattern reversed in the 70- to 74-year age group
as DALYs for women surpassed those for men. At all
ages beyond 75 years, women had more DALYs than
men, presumably driven by greater survival among
women. LPA DALYs rose steadily for both men and
women beginning at age 25 years, peaking for both
sexes in the 80- to 84-year age group and declining
thereafter.
Age-standardized DALYs due to LPA were highly
variable by both region and sex. The highest rates
were seen for both men and women in North Africa
and the Middle East, Oceania, tropical Latin America,
and the Caribbean (Figure 23), with high rates for men
also
observed
in
Central
Asia
(Supplemental
Figure 65). The lowest age-standardized DALYs for
LPA were seen for both men and women in high-
income Asia Paciﬁc, Southern Latin America, and
Eastern subSaharan Africa; for men in high-income
North America; and for women in Andean Latin
America.
LPA remains a major threat to public health, and
the overall burden is increasing globally even as age-
standardized rates are declining. Although few health
systems have historically focused on LPA, there is
increased awareness and attention being paid to LPA
as exempliﬁed by the 2018 World Health Organization
Global Action Plan for Physical Activity. However, the
factors that inﬂuence population physical activity
largely reside outside of the health sector. Increasing
physical activity will depend on effective partner-
ships and collaboration between health and sectors
such as transportation, education, urban planning,
workplace
health
strategies,
and
environmental
protection.
SUBNATIONAL DISEASE BURDEN
GBD 2019 estimates disease burden within countries
as well as between countries. Figure 24 shows the
age-standardized rate of YLLs due to CVD for all
countries, with Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Kenya, Mexico, the United States, and the United
Kingdom shown at the ﬁrst subnational administra-
tive level and Stockholm County shown separately
from the rest of Sweden. Subnational disease esti-
mation is made possible through collaboration with
these governments. Subnational data reveal wide
differences in DALYs within countries. For example,
in Kenya in 2019, IHD DALYs were estimated to vary
from 342.7 per 100,000 (95% UI: 212.4 to 531.7 per
100,000) in Turkana to 1,215.4 per 100,000 (95% UI:
856.8 to 1,612.4 per 100,000) in Nyeri, a 112.0% dif-
ference within Kenya. IHD DALYs in India ranged
from 506.6 per 100,000 (95% UI: 379.6 to 819.0 per
100,000) in Mizoram to 5,413.2 per 100,000 (95% UI:
4,316.9 to 6,389.9 per 100,000) in Punjab, a 165.8%
difference within the country. In Brazil, IHD DALYs
varied from 771.2 per 100,000 (95% UI: 679.4 to 866.3
per 100,000) in Amazonas to 2,416.2 per 100,000 (95%
UI: 2,176.7 to 2,686.2 per 100,000) in the Rio de
Janeiro state, a 103.2% difference within the country.
Within the United States, there was a 99.6% differ-
ence in IHD DALYs, ranging from 1,438.3 per 100,000
(95% UI: 1,210.7 to 1,699.0 per 100,000) in Utah to
4,293.1 per 100,000 (95% UI: 3,636.0 to 5,033.0 per
100,000) in West Virginia. In Mexico, they ranged
from 890.5 per 100,000 (95% UI: 752.2 to 1,073.3 per
100,000) in Quintana Roo to 2,315.1 per 100,000 (95%
UI: 1,932.1 to 2,716.3 per 100,000) in Chihuahua, an
88.9%
difference
within
Mexico.

attributable to elevated levels of metabolic risk fac-
tors also varies signiﬁcantly within countries.
Further analysis of the variation of CVD burden
within countries will be vital to implementing health
policies that reduce burden but also decrease dis-
parities. The strategies to deal with these inequalities
include: 1) targeting reduction in key modiﬁable risks
including diet, tobacco, alcohol, physical activity, and
obesity; 2) improved access and quality of health care;
and 3) a renewed focus on the social determinants of
health. Addressing risk factors may prove to be an
important initial opportunity to reduce disparities in
parallel with broader efforts targeting social de-
terminants,
with
potential
indirect
beneﬁts
for
improving those social determinants, such as reduced
ﬁnancial hardship due to fewer acute cardiac events
among working-age adults.
Several risks are increasing globally and warrant
increased
policy
and
health
system
attention,
including
high
BMI,
blood
pressure,
unhealthy
cholesterol, and poor diet. Targeting subnational
locations where metabolic risks are rising rapidly
may
be
an
important
approach
for
testing
new
interventions and delivering resources where they
will have the biggest impact. There is often a gap
between the identiﬁcation of a problem, the location
of a solution, and the translation of that solution to
an entire population. We currently lack a systematic,
scalable process for determining which interventions
are most likely to succeed in a given location, and
research funding should be directed at addressing
this gap.
STUDY LIMITATIONS
Estimates from GBD 2019 should be interpreted in
light
of
several
limitations.
Death
certiﬁcates,
although
an
essential
source
of
data
for
public
health, may be misclassiﬁed given the difﬁculty of
identifying an underlying cause of death. GBD 2019
applies statistical methods to improve the compa-
rability of health information coded using the ICD
system and continuously evaluates, improves on,
and reports the details of these methods. The use of
different subnational population-based studies may
lead to compositional bias of national estimates,

although GBD 2019 adjusts variance and weighting
to reﬂect this possibility. ICD system codes from
administrative health facility data may represent a
group of patients that differs from the standard case
deﬁnition for a disease, although GBD 2019 applies
adjustments to these data to account for differential
access to health care and alternate case deﬁnitions.
Access to CVD diagnostic technologies is likely to
inﬂuence estimates of some conditions, with lower
access resulting in lower observed prevalence. Some
commonly
used
diagnostic
tools—for
example,
electrocardiogram for AF—will underestimate true
disease prevalence. Estimates are reported with an
uncertainty interval that should always be carefully
considered,
given
that
it
represents
both
data
sparsity and differences in sample size across data
sources and study locations. However, uncertainty
may be underestimated in locations where no data
on CVD of any kind are available. Limited data on
CVD and resulting wider uncertainty intervals for
parts of sub-Saharan Africa, Oceania, and Asia may
restrict our ability to interpret trends in burden
over
time.
An
important
use
of
GBD
results
is
therefore to identify gaps in CVD health data and
guide investments in future disease surveillance. In
particular, better data are needed on the incidence
of coronary events, cardiac arrest, and the severity
and
associated
disability
of
chronic
heart
and
vascular diseases. Comorbidity of CVD and the joint
effects
of
multiple
risk
factors
remains
a
topic
where further investigation is also needed.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
CVDs remain the leading cause of disease burden in
the world. CVD continues its decades-long rise for
almost all countries outside the high-income world
and, alarmingly, age-standardized CVD rates have
begun to rise in many locations where they were
previously declining. There remains a large gap be-
tween identifying CVD as a problem, identifying the
best package of solutions, and delivering them to the
entire population.
GBD 2019 continues to be a platform that allows
tracking and benchmarking of progress in the reduc-
tion of CVD burden. However, large investments are
still
needed
to
improve
disease
surveillance,
including the expansion of robust vital registration
systems, reliable electronic health records, and health
surveys to all countries.

High rates of excess mortality are currently being
observed because of the global severe acute respira-
tory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic, and much of
this additional disease burden may be CVD due to the
effects of both viral infection but also the unintended
consequence of social distancing behaviors, such as
changes in the delivery of health care (45,46). Further
research in this area is urgently needed.
CVD was the cause of 6.2 million deaths occurring
between the ages of 30 and 70 years in 2019. There is a
pressing need to focus on implementing existing cost-
effective interventions and health policies if the
world is to meet the targets for Sustainable Develop-
ment Goal 3 and achieve at least a 30% reduction in
premature mortality due to noncommunicable dis-
ease by 2030. In the face of a global viral pandemic,
we still must emphasize global commitments to
reduce the suffering and premature death caused by
CVD, which limits healthy and sustainable develop-
ment for every country in the world.
