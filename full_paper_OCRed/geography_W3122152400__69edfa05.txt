Economic Costs of Diabetes in the U.S.
in 2012
AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION
OBJECTIVEdThis study updates previous estimates of the economic burden of diagnosed
diabetes and quantiﬁes the increased health resource use and lost productivity associated with
diabetes in 2012.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSdThe study uses a prevalence-based approach
that combines the demographics of the U.S. population in 2012 with diabetes prevalence, ep-
idemiological data, health care cost, and economic data into a Cost of Diabetes Model. Health
resource use and associated medical costs are analyzed by age, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance
coverage, medical condition, and health service category. Data sources include national surveys,
Medicare standard analytical ﬁles, and one of the largest claims databases for the commercially
insured population in the U.S.
RESULTSdThe total estimated cost of diagnosed diabetes in 2012 is $245 billion, including
$176 billion in direct medical costs and $69 billion in reduced productivity. The largest com-
ponents of medical expenditures are hospital inpatient care (43% of the total medical cost),
prescription medications to treat the complications of diabetes (18%), antidiabetic agents and
diabetes supplies (12%), physician ofﬁce visits (9%), and nursing/residential facility stays (8%).
People with diagnosed diabetes incur average medical expenditures of about $13,700 per year, of
which about $7,900 is attributed to diabetes. People with diagnosed diabetes, on average, have
medical expenditures approximately 2.3 times higher than what expenditures would be in the
absence of diabetes. For the cost categories analyzed, care for people with diagnosed diabetes
accounts for more than 1 in 5 health care dollars in the U.S., and more than half of that expen-
diture is directly attributable to diabetes. Indirect costs include increased absenteeism ($5 billion)
and reduced productivity while at work ($20.8 billion) for the employed population, reduced
productivity for those not in the labor force ($2.7 billion), inability to work as a result of disease-
related disability ($21.6 billion), and lost productive capacity due to early mortality ($18.5
billion).
CONCLUSIONSdThe estimated total economic cost of diagnosed diabetes in 2012 is $245
billion, a 41% increase from our previous estimate of $174 billion (in 2007 dollars). This
estimate highlights the substantial burden that diabetes imposes on society. Additional compo-
nents of societal burden omitted from our study include intangibles from pain and suffering, re-
sources from care provided by nonpaid caregivers, and the burden associated with undiagnosed
diabetes.

iabetes imposes a substantial bur-
den on the economy of the U.S. in
the form of increased medical costs
and indirect costs from work-related ab-
senteeism, reduced productivity at work
and at home, reduced labor force partic-
ipation from chronic disability, and pre-
mature mortality (1,2). In addition to the
economic burden that has been quanti-
ﬁed, diabetes imposes high intangible
costs on society in terms of reduced qual-
ity of life and pain and suffering of people
with diabetes, their families, and friends.
Improved understanding of the eco-
nomic cost of diabetes and its major
determinants helps to inform policymakers
and to motivate decisions to reduce di-
abetes prevalence and burden. The pre-
vious cost of diabetes study by the
American Diabetes Association (ADA) esti-
mated that there were nearly 17.5 million
people living in the U.S. with diagnosed
type 1 or type 2 diabetes in 2007, at an
estimated cost of $174 billion in higher
medical costs and lost productivity (2).
The percentage of the population
with diagnosed diabetes continues to
rise, with one study projecting that as
many as one in three U.S. adults could
have diabetes by 2050 if current trends
continue (3). In this updated cost of di-
abetes study, we estimate the total na-
tional economic burden of diagnosed
diabetes in 2012 reﬂecting continued
growth in prevalence of diabetes and its
complications; changing health care prac-
tices, technology, and cost of treatment;
and changing economic conditions.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODSdThis study follows the
methodology used in the 2002 and 2007
costs of diabetes studies by the ADA, with
modiﬁcations to reﬁne the analyses
where appropriate (1,2). A prevalence-
based approach is used to estimate the
medical costs by demographic group,
health service category, and medical con-
dition. One difference from earlier studies
is that for some analyses we now include
race/ethnicity as a demographic dimen-
sion. We analyze the prevalence of diag-
nosed diabetes, utilization and costs
attributable to diabetes by age-group (un-
der 18, 18–34, 35–44, 45–54, 55–59,
60–64, 65–69, and over 70 years of age),
sex, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white,
non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic other,
and Hispanic), and insurance status (pri-
vate; government including Medicare,
Medicaid, Children’s Health Insurance
Program, and other government-sponsored
coverage; and uninsured). State-speciﬁc es-
timates of prevalence and costs are pro-
vided in Supplementary Table 11.

Major data sources analyzed include
National Health Interview Survey (NHIS),
American Community Survey (ACS), Be-
havioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
(BRFSS), Medical Expenditure Panel Sur-
vey (MEPS), OptumInsight’s de-identiﬁed
Normative Health Information database
(dNHI), the Medicare 5% sample Standard
Analytical Files (SAFs), Nationwide Inpa-
tient Sample (NIS), National Ambulatory
Medical Care Survey (NAMCS), National
Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey
(NHAMCS), National Nursing Home Sur-
vey (NNHS), National Home and Hospice
Care Survey (NHHCS), and Current Pop-
ulation Survey (CPS). We use the most re-
cent year’s data available for each of these
data sources, though for certain analyses
we combine 3 years of data to achieve suf-
ﬁcient sample size. To estimate medical
costs for less common health service cate-
gories such as hospital inpatient care, emer-
gency care, home health, and podiatry, we
combine 5 years of MEPS data to reduce
variance in utilization and cost. The demo-
graphics of the U.S. population in 2012
with diabetes prevalence, epidemiological
data, health care cost, and economic data
are then combined into a Cost of Diabetes
Model. Supplementary Table 1 describes
how these data sources are used, along
with their respective strengths and limita-
tions, pertinent to this study. All cost and
utilization estimates are extrapolated to the
projected U.S. population in 2012 (4), with
cost estimates calculated in 2012 dollars
using the appropriate components of the
medical consumer price index or total con-
sumer price index (5).
Estimating the size of the population
with diabetes
To estimate the number of people with
diagnosed diabetes in 2012 we combined
U.S. Census Bureau population numbers
with estimated prevalence of diabetes by
age-group, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance
coverage, and whether residing in a nurs-
ing home.
Combining the 2009, 2010, and
2011 NHIS data produced a sample
sufﬁcient to estimate diabetes prevalence
by demographic and insurance coverage
(n 5 123,185). Prevalence is based on re-
spondents answering “yes” to the ques-
tion, “Have you EVER been told by a
doctor or health professional that you
have diabetes or sugar diabetes?” We ex-
clude gestational diabetes mellitus from
the prevalence estimates. Previous re-
search ﬁnds that self-report of a physi-
cian’s diagnosis of diabetes is accurate in
estimating prevalence of diagnosed diabe-
tes (6).
For the 2007 cost study, the esti-
mated prevalence of diagnosed diabetes
among the institutionalized population
(24%) came from an analysis of the 2004
NNHS. There has been no update of the
NNHS since 2004. Nearly one in three
(32.8%) nursing home residents has di-
agnosed diabetes based on a nationally
representative study that analyzed medi-
cal charts, minimum dataset records, and
prescription claims ﬁles to identify people
with diabetes (7). On the basis of this up-
dated information on diabetes prevalence
amongnursinghomeresidents,weestimate
age-group–, sex-, and race/ethnicity–
speciﬁc prevalence using the same distri-
bution of the population demographic
variables as shown in the 2004 NNHS
survey data among the 1.6 million nursing
home residents in 2012. Few data exist
regarding the prevalence of diabetes
among the noncivilian population or the
institutionalized populations other than
those in nursing homes (e.g., in prisons).
We assume that the noncivilian popula-
tion and the institutionalized populations
other than those in nursing homes have
diabetes prevalence similar to the nonin-
stitutionalized population, controlling for
demographics, based on the limited evi-
dence available (8,9).
Combining the NHIS and NNHS
data, we estimate the prevalence of di-
agnosed diabetes among population sub-
groups (by age-group, sex, race/ethnicity,
and insurance coverage). Supplementary
Table 3 shows that prevalence of diabetes
increases with age, is somewhat higher for
males than for females, and is highest
among non-Hispanic blacks. Reﬂecting
the high prevalence among the elderly
population, 13.4% of the population
with government-sponsored medical in-
surance (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid) has di-
agnosed diabetes as compared with 4.6%
among the privately insured and 3.7%
among the uninsured populations.
State-speciﬁc estimates of diabetes
prevalence (Supplementary Table 11)
come from combing the 2010 ACS, the
2009 and 2010 BRFSS, and the 2004
NNHS. We applied a statistical matching
procedure that randomly matches each
person in the 2010 ACS with a similar
person either in the BRFSS (if not living
in a nursing home) or in the NNHS (if
living in a nursing home). Each noninsti-
tutionalized person in the ACS is matched
with a person in the BRFSS in the same
state, sex, age-group (15 age-groups),
race/ethnicity, household income level
(eight levels), and insured/uninsured sta-
tus. Each person in the ACS in a nursing/
residential facility is matched with a person
in the NNHS in the same sex, age-group,
and race/ethnicity. Our state prevalence es-
timates are slightly different from those re-
ported by the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) for 2010,
which are based solely on the BRFSS (10).
Estimating the direct medical cost
attributed to diabetes
We estimate health resource use among
the population with diabetes in excess of
resource use that would be expected in
the absence of diabetes. Diabetes increases
the risk of developing neurological, periph-
eral vascular, cardiovascular, renal, endo-
crine/metabolic, ophthalmic, and other
complications (see Supplementary Table
2 for a more comprehensive list of comor-
bidities) (2). Diabetes also increases the
cost of treating general conditions that
are not directly related to diabetes (2,11–
13). Therefore, a portion of health care
expenditures for these medical conditions
is attributed to diabetes.
As elaborated in the 2007 study, the
approach used to quantify the increase in
health resource use associated with di-
abetes was inﬂuenced by four data limi-
tations: 1) absence of a single data source
for all estimates, 2) small sample size in
some data sources, 3) correlation of both
diabetes and its comorbidities with other
factors such as age and obesity, and 4)
under-reporting of diabetes and its co-
morbidities in certain data sources. Be-
cause of these limitations we estimate
diabetes-attributed costs using one of
two approaches for each cost component.
For cost components estimated solely
from the MEPS (ambulance services,
home health, podiatry, diabetic supplies,
and other equipment and supplies), we
use a simple comparison of annual per
capita health resource use for people with
and without diabetes controlling for
age, sex, and race/ethnicity. For nursing/
residential facility use (which is not cap-
tured in the MEPS) and for cost compo-
nents that rely on analysis of medical
encounter data (hospital inpatient, emer-
gency care, and ambulatory visits), we use
an attributed risk methodology often
used in disease-burden studies that relies
on population etiological fractions (2,14).
Etiological fractions estimate the excess
use of health care services among the di-
abetic population relative to a similar
population that does not have diabetes.

Both approaches are equivalent under a
reasonable set of assumptions, but the
ﬁrst approach cannot be used with some
national data sources analyzed (e.g., NIS)
that are visit/hospital discharge level ﬁles,
which might or might not identify the pa-
tient as having diabetes even if the patient
does indeed have diabetes (2,14).
The attributable fraction approach
combines etiological fractions («) with to-
tal projected U.S. health service use (U) in
2012 for each age-group (a), sex (s), med-
ical condition (c), and care delivery set-
ting (H)dhospital inpatient, emergency
departments, and ambulatory visits (phy-
sician ofﬁce visits combined with hospital
outpatient/clinic visits):

Diabetes and its comorbidities are cor-
related with other patient characteristics
(e.g., demographics and body weight). To
mitigate bias caused by correlation, we
estimate age/sex/setting–speciﬁc etiologi-
cal fractions for each medical condition.
The primary data sources for calculating
etiological fractions are OptumInsight’s
dNHI data (a consolidation of the Ingenix
Research Data Mart and MCURE databases
used in the 2007 study) and the 2010 5%
sample Medicare SAFs. The dNHI data
contains a complete set of medical
claims for over 23 million commercially
insured beneﬁciaries in 2011 and allows
patient records to be linked during the
year and across health delivery settings.
This allows us to identify people with a
diabetes ICD-9 diagnosis code (250.xx)
in any of their medical claims during the
year. The Medicare 5% sample SAFs
contain claims data ﬁled on behalf of
Medicare beneﬁciaries under both Part
A and Part B, and like the dNHI we iden-
tify people with diabetes based on dia-
betes ICD-9 diagnosis codes. The large
size of these two claims databases enables
the generation of age/sex/setting–speciﬁc
rate ratios for each medical condition,
which are more stable than rates estimated
using the MEPS.
Unlike the MEPS, the dNHI data and
Medicare 5% claims data do not contain
race/ethnicity and select patient charac-
teristics that could affect both patients’
health status and health seeking behav-
iors. For the 10 medical conditionsd
cataract, cellulitis, conduction disorders
and cardiac dysrhythmias, general medi-
cal condition, heart failure, hypertension,
myocardial infarction, other chronic is-
chemic heart disease, renal failure and
its sequelae, and urinary tract infectiond
which are the largest contributors to the
overall cost of diabetes, we estimated two
multivariate Poisson regressions, using
data from the MEPS, to determine the ex-
tent to which controlling only for age and
sex might bias the rate ratios. First, we
estimated a naïve model that produces
diabetes-related rate ratios for hospital in-
patient days, emergency visits, and ambu-
latory visits controlling for age and sex
only. Then, we estimated a full model
that includes diabetes status as the main
explanatory variable and various known
predictors of health service utilization in-
cluding age, sex, education level, income,
marital status, medical insurance status,
and race/ethnicity as covariates. For the
full model our focus is not on the relation-
ship between health care use and the co-
variates (other than diabetes), but rather
these covariates are included to control
for patient characteristics not available
in medical claims data that could be cor-
related with both medical conditions and
health-seeking behavior. The full model
omits indicators for the presence of co-
existing conditions or complications of
diabetes (e.g., hypertension), since in-
cluding such variables could bias low
the estimated relationship between diabe-
tes and health care use for each of the 10
medical conditions. The rate ratio coefﬁ-
cients for the diabetes ﬂag variable in the
naïve and full models are then compared.
The ﬁndings suggest statistically signiﬁ-
cant overestimates of the rate ratios for
emergency visits when using the naïve
model for ﬁve condition categories. For
inpatient days, we found signiﬁcant over-
estimates in the rate ratios for three
condition categories. For ambulatory vis-
its, only hypertension was found to have a
signiﬁcantly higher rate ratio by compar-
ing the MEPS-based naïve model and the
full model.
To remedy the relative risk overesti-
mation for these condition categories, we
scaled the rate ratios estimated from
dNHI and Medicare 5% sample using
the regression results from the MEPS
analysis by applying a scalar (with the
scalar calculated as the full model rate
ratio divided by the naïve model rate ra-
tio) (2). For emergency department visits,
claims-based rate ratios were scaled down
for myocardial infarction (scale 5 0.94),
other chronic ischemic heart disease
(0.93), hypertension (0.71), cellulitis
(0.72), and renal failure (0.95). For inpa-
tient days, claims-based rate ratios were
scaled down for hypertension (0.62), cel-
lulitis (0.93), and renal failure (0.90).
Physician ofﬁce visits were scaled down
for hypertension (0.89). We did not
ﬁnd a signiﬁcant overestimate of the rate
ratios for general medical conditions for
any of the three health service delivery
settings comparing the MEPS-based naïve
model and the full model. However, a
comparison of the claims-based rate ratios
with the rate ratios calculated from the
MEPS-based naïve model found that the
claims-based rate ratios for general condi-
tions were signiﬁcantly higher than the
MEPS-based rate ratios for emergency
department visits, hospital inpatient
days, and ambulatory visits, respectively.
Therefore, to be conservative in our cost
estimates, we downward adjusted claims-
based rate ratios for emergency department
visits (0.70), hospital inpatient days (0.68),
and ambulatory visits (0.66) for the general
condition group by applying a scalar calcu-
lated as the MEPS-based naïve model rate
ratio divided by the claims-based rate ratio.
Estimates of health resource use at-
tributed to diabetes were combined with
estimates of the average medical cost per
event, in 2012 dollars, to compute total
medical costs attributed to diabetes. For
hospital inpatient days, ofﬁce visits, emer-
gency visits, and outpatient visits, we use
average cost per visit/day speciﬁc to the
medical conditions modeled. We com-
bined the 2008–2010 MEPS ﬁles to esti-
mate the average cost per event, except
that for less common conditions or cost
categories we combined the 2006–2010
MEPS ﬁles to obtain a larger sample and
thereby produce more precise cost esti-
mates. Although the MEPS contains
both inpatient facility and professional
care.diabetesjournals.org

expenditures and the NIS contains only
facility charges (which are converted to
costs using hospital-speciﬁc cost-to-charge
ratios), the NIS has a much larger sample
(n 5 ;8 million discharges in 2010) and
also contains 5-digit diagnosis codes.
Therefore, we use the 2010 NIS to esti-
mate inpatient facility costs and the com-
bined 2008–2010 MEPS to estimate
the cost for professional services. The av-
erage costs per event or day by medical
condition are shown in Supplementary
Table 4.
Utilization of prescription medication
(excluding insulin and other antidiabetic
agents) for each medical condition is
estimated from medications prescribed
during physician’s ofﬁce, emergency de-
partment, and outpatient visits attributed
to diabetes. The average number of med-
ications prescribed during a visit for each
age-sex-race stratum was estimated from
2008–2010 NAMCS and 2007–2009
NHAMCS data. We calculated the total
number of people with diabetes that use
insulin and other antidiabetic agents by
combining diabetes prevalence and rate
of use for these antidiabetic agents ob-
tained from the 2009–2011 NHIS. The
average cost per prescription ﬁlled, insu-
lin, and oral and other antidiabetic agents
were obtained from the combined MEPS
2008–2010. We combined the utilization
of these medications with the average cost
per prescription to estimate the cost by
age, sex, race/ethnicity, and insurance sta-
tus. The average per capita cost for dia-
betic supplies by age-sex-race stratum
was calculated from the MEPS 2008–
2010. Over-the-counter medications
were not included owing to the lack of
data on whether diabetes increases the
use of such medications.
Consistent with the 2007 study, total
nursing/residential facility days attributed
to diabetes were estimated by combining
the average length of stay and the nursing/
residential facility population. Using
2004 NNHS, we calculated the number
of residents with diabetes in each age-sex
stratum, which was adjusted using the
32.8% diabetes prevalence estimate
among nursing home residents, obtained
from literature (7). Nursing/residential fa-
cility use attributed to diabetes was esti-
mated using an attributable risk approach
where the prevalence of diabetes among
residents was compared with the preva-
lence of diabetes among the overall pop-
ulation in the same age-sex stratum. The
analyses were conducted separately for
short-stay, long-stay, and residential
facility residents to estimate total days of
care. Similar to the 2007 study, cost per
day was obtained from a geographically
representative cost of care survey for
2012 (15).
Hospice days attributed to diabetes
represents a combination of length of stay
and diabetes prevalence among hospice
residents. The 2007 NHHCS was used to
calculate the number of hospice residents
with diabetes and those that have a pri-
mary diagnosis of diabetes along with the
average length of stay for each age-sex-race
stratum. Cost per resident per day obtained
from the Hospice Association of America
was combined with hospice days attributed
to diabetes to estimate the total cost of
hospice care attributed to diabetes.
The 2006–2010 MEPS ﬁles were
combined to increase the sample size to
analyze the use of home health, podiatry,
ambulance services, and other equipment
and supplies. These cost components are
estimated by comparing annual per capita
cost for people with and without diabetes,
controlling for age. Due to small sample
size, sex and race/ethnicity were not in-
cluded as a stratum when calculating
costs per capita.
Estimating the indirect cost
attributed to diabetes
The indirect costs associated with diabe-
tes include workdays missed due to
health conditions (absenteeism), re-
duced work productivity while working
due to health conditions (presenteeism),
reduced workforce participation due to
disability, and productivity lost due to
premature mortality (16–18). Produc-
tivity loss occurs among those in the
labor force as well as among the nonem-
ployed population. To estimate the
value of lost productivity, we calculate
the number of missed workdays result-
ing from absenteeism, reduced work
productivity due to presenteeism, work-
force participation reductions associated
with chronic disability, and work years
lost resulting from premature mortality
associated with diabetes. This approach
mirrors the one used in the 2007 study,
with the exception of adding race/ethnicity
as a dimension. More recent data sources
were used with per capita productivity
loss calculated by combining the estimates
derived from the 2009–2011 NHIS and
the average annual earnings from the
2011 CPS. Earnings were inﬂated to
2012 dollars using the overall consumer
price index, and per capita estimates
were applied to the number of people
with diabetes by age-group, sex, and
race/ethnicity.
c Absenteeism is deﬁned as the number
of workdays missed due to poor health,
and prior research ﬁnds that people
with diabetes have higher rates of ab-
senteeism than the population without
diabetes (16–18). Estimates of excess
absenteeism associated with diabetes
range from 1.8 to 7% of total workdays
(17,19–22). Ordinary least squares re-
gression with the 2009–2011 NHIS
shows that self-reported annual missed
workdays are statistically higher for
people with diabetes. Control variables
include age-group, sex, race/ethnicity,
diagnosed hypertension status (yes/no),
and body weight status (normal, over-
weight, obese, unknown). Diabetes is
entered as a dichotomous variable (di-
agnosed diabetes 5 1; otherwise 0), as
well as an interaction term with age-
group. Controlling for hypertension and
body weight produces more conserva-
tive estimates of the diabetes impact on
absenteeism as comorbidities of diabetes
are correlated with body weight status
and a portion of hypertension is attrib-
uted to diabetes. Workers with diabetes
average three more missed workdays
than their peers without diabetes, with
excess missed workdays varying by de-
mographic group.
c Presenteeism is deﬁned as reduced
productivity while at work, and is
generally measured through worker
responses to surveys. These surveys rely
on the self-reported inputs on the
number of reduced productivity hours
incurred over a given time frame. Mul-
tiple recent studies report that in-
dividuals with diabetes display higher
rates of presenteeism than their peers
without diabetes (19,21,22). The rate
of presenteeism among the population
with diabetes exceeds rates for their
colleagues without diabetesdwith the
excess rates ranging from 1.8 to 38%
of annual productivity (17,19–22).
These estimates comparing presen-
teeism for employees with diabetes
versus those without diabetes, how-
ever, fail to control for other factors
that may be correlated with diabetes
(e.g., age and weight status). Conse-
quently, we model productivity loss
associated with diabetes-attributed pre-
senteeism using the estimate (6.6%)
from the 2007 study that controls for
the impact of factors correlated with
diabetes (2).

c Inability to work associated with di-
abetes is estimated using a conservative
approach that focuses on unemploy-
ment related to long-term disability.
The
CDC
estimates
that
roughly
65,700 lower-limb amputations are
performed each year on people with
diabetes (23). These amputations and
other comorbidities of diabetes can
make it difﬁcult for some people
with diabetes to remain in the work-
force or to ﬁnd employment in their
chosen profession (22,24). To quantify
diabetes-related disability, we identify
people in the 2009–2011 NHIS be-
tween ages 18 and 65 years who receive
Supplemental Security Income (SSI)
payments for disability. Using logistic
regression, we estimate the relationship
between diabetes and the receipt of
SSI payments controlling for age-group,
sex, race/ethnicity, hypertension, and
weight. The results of this analysis
suggest that people with diabetes have a
2.4 percentage point higher rate of be-
ing out of the workforce and receiving
disability payments compared with
their peers without diabetes. The di-
abetes effect increases with age and
varies by demographicdranging from
0.7 percentage points for non-Hispanic
white males aged 65–69 years to 7.4
percentage points for non-Hispanic
black females aged 55–59 years. Mod-
eling disability-related unemployment
is a conservative approach to modeling
the employment effect of diabetes; re-
gression analysis of the NHIS suggests
that people with diabetes have actual
labor force participation rates averag-
ing approximately 10 percentage points
lower than their peers without diabetes.
The average daily earnings for those in
the workforce are used as a proxy for
the economic impact of reduced em-
ployment due to chronic disability. SSI
payments are considered transfer pay-
ments and therefore are not included in
the social cost of not working due to
disability.
c Reduced productivity for those not
in the workforce is included in our
estimate of the national burden. This
population includes all adults under 65
years of age who are not employed
(including those voluntarily or in-
voluntarily not in the workforce). The
contribution of people not in the
workforce to national productivity in-
cludes time spent providing child care,
household activities, and other ac-
tivities such as volunteering in the
community. Prior estimates of reduced
productivity for those not in the
workforce were based on estimates of
“bed days” (which is deﬁned as a day
spent in bed because of poor health).
The NHIS no longer collects data on
bed days. Therefore, we use per capita
absenteeism estimates for the working
population as a proxy for reduced
productivity days among the non-
employed population in a similar
demographic. Whereas each work-
day lost due to absenteeism is based
on estimated average daily earnings,
there is no readily available measure
of the value of a day lost for those not
in the workforce. Studies often use
minimum wage as a proxy for the
value of time lost, but this will un-
derestimate the value of time. Using
average earnings for their employed
counterparts will overestimate the
value of time. Similar to the 2007
study, we use 75% of the average
earnings for people in the workforce
as a productivity proxy for those un-
der 65 years of age not in the labor
force (which is close to the midpoint
between minimum wage and the av-
erage hourly wage earned by a de-
mographic similar to the unemployed
under 65 years of age).

c Premature mortality associated with
diabetes reduces future productivity
(and not just the current year pro-
ductivity). Ideally, to model the value
of lost productivity in 2012 associated
with premature mortality one would
calculate the number and character-
istics of all people who would have
been alive in 2012 but who died prior
to 2012 because of diabetes. Data lim-
itations prevent using this approach.
Instead, we estimate the number of
premature deaths associated with di-
abetes in 2012 and calculate the pres-
ent value of their expected future
earnings.
To estimate the total number of
deaths attributable to diabetes we ana-
lyzed the CDC’s 2009 Mortality Multiple
Cause File to obtain mortality data by age,
sex, and race/ethnicity for cardiovascular
disease, cerebrovascular disease, renal
failure, and diabetes. A literature review
supports the 2007 ADA report estimate
that ;16% of cardiovascular disease (ex-
cluding cerebrovascular disease) deaths
can be attributed to diabetes (1,2,25).
To estimate the fraction of cerebrovascu-
lar disease and renal failure deaths attrib-
uted to diabetes, we used etiological
fractions for emergency department use
as a proxy for mortality etiological frac-
tions (2). Our estimates suggest that
;28% of deaths listing cerebrovascular
disease as the primary cause and ;55%
of deaths listing renal failure as the pri-
mary cause can be attributed to diabetes.
The elderly represent the largest popula-
tion group where deaths attributable to
diabetes occur, with ;71% of deaths oc-
curring among people aged $70 years
and 8% of deaths occurring among peo-
ple aged 65–69 years. To generate 2012
estimates, we grow the 2009 CDC mor-
tality data using the annual diabetic pop-
ulation growth rate from 2009 to 2012 for
each age, sex, and race/ethnicity group.
Productivity loss associated with
early mortality is calculated by taking
the net present value of future productivity
(PVFP) for men and women by age
and race/ethnicity using the same discount
rate (3%), assumptions, and equation
outlined in the 2007 ADA report (2). We
combined the average annual earnings
from the CPS, expected mortality rates
from the CDC, and employment rates
fromthe CPS byage,sex, and race/ethnicity
to calculate the net present value of future
earnings of a person who dies prematurely.
Employment rates for 2007 (rather than
2012) are used to calculate PVFP as rates
for 2007 are closer to the historical average
(whereas rates for 2008–2012 are lower
than average due to the recession). The re-
sults incorporate U.S. Bureau of Labor Sta-
tistics ﬁndings that many older workers are
delaying retirement because of the eco-
nomic downturn (with ;15% employed
at age 65 years and diminishing to ;5%
employed at age 70 years), with this pattern
expected to exist even after the economy
recovers (2).
RESULTSdIn 2012, an estimated 22.3
million people in the U.S. were diagnosed
with diabetes, representing about 7% of
the population. This estimate is higher
than but consistent with those published
by the CDC for 2010 (23,26). The esti-
mated national cost of diabetes in 2012 is
$245 billion, of which $176 billion (72%)
represents direct health care expenditures
attributed to diabetes and $69 billion
(28%) represents lost productivity from
work-related absenteeism, reduced pro-
ductivity at work and at home, unem-
ployment from chronic disability, and
premature mortality.
Health resource use attributed to
diabetes
Table 1 shows estimates of health re-
source utilization attributed to diabetes
and incurred by people with diabetes
as a percentage of total national utiliza-
tion. For example, of the projected 168
million hospital inpatient days in the
U.S. in 2012, an estimated 43.1 million
days (25.7%) are incurred by people with
diabetes of which 26.4 million days are
attributed to diabetes. About one-third
of all nursing/residential facility days are
incurred by people with diabetes, and
over half of those are attributed to diabe-
tes. About half of all physician ofﬁce vis-
its, emergency department visits, hospital
outpatient visits, and medication pre-
scriptions (excluding insulin and other
antidiabetic agents) incurred by people
with diabetes are attributed to their
diabetes.
Table 2 shows that the population
aged 65 years and older uses a substan-
tially larger portion of services, especially
hospital inpatient days, nursing/residential
facility days, and hospice, compared
with those under age 65 years. The signif-
icant increase in nursing/residential days
attributed to diabetes from the 2007
study reﬂects both the increasing cost
and the increased prevalence of diabetes

(32.8%) in general, and among the elderly
in particular. Total utilization of prescrip-
tion medications attributed to diabetes has
more than doubled from the estimate in
the 2007 study, reﬂecting a dramatic in-
crease in the use of medications treating
general conditions and diabetes comor-
bidities among people with diabetes. Sup-
plementary Table 5 shows the per capita
health resource use by demographic.
Analysis of health resource use attrib-
uted to diabetes by medical condition
(Table 3), including diabetes, chronic
complications of diabetes, and general
medical conditions, shows that a large
portion of health resource use attributed
to diabetesdparticularly hospital inpa-
tient and emergency department visitsdis
for general medical conditions that are
not chronic complications of diabetes.
As discussed in the 2007 cost of diabetes
study, diabetes contributes to longer
hospital length of stay regardless of the
reason for admission (and controlling
for other factors that affect hospital
length of stay) (2). In addition to general
medical conditions, a substantial amount
of attributed health resource use is for
chronic complications of diabetes, partic-
ularly cardiovascular diseases and renal
complications. Finally, more than one-
third of physician ofﬁce visits and nearly
40% of hospital outpatient visits have di-
abetes listed as the primary reason for
the visit. Supplementary Table 8 shows
the proportion of total health resource
use attributed to diabetes for each medical
condition.
Health care expenditures attributed
to diabetes
Health care expenditures attributed to
diabetes reﬂect the additional expendi-
tures the nation incurs because of diabe-
tes. This equates to the total health care
expenditures for people with diabetes
minus the projected level of expenditures
that would have occurred for those peo-
ple in the absence of diabetes. Table 4
summarizes the national expenditure for
the cost components analyzed, account-
ing for over $1.3 trillion in projected
expenditure for 2012. Approximately
$306 billion of the total is incurred by
people with diabetes, reﬂecting 23%
of the total health care dollars. Costs at-
tributed to diabetes total $176 billion,
or 57% of the total medical costs incurred
by people with diabetes. For the cost
components analyzed, more than 1 in ev-
ery 10 health care dollars is attributed to
diabetes.
National health-related expenditures
are projected to exceed $2.8 trillion in
2012, but slightly less than half of these
expenditures are included in our analysis
(27,28). These cost estimates omit na-
tional expenditures (and any portion of
such expenditures that might be attributable
to diabetes) for administering govern-
ment health and private insurance pro-
grams, investment in research and
infrastructure, over-the-counter medica-
tions, disease management and wellness
programs, and ofﬁce visits to nonphysi-
cian providers other than podiatrists
(e.g., dentists and optometrists). Expendi-
tures for health resources such as care in
residential mental retardation facilities
are likewise excluded from the analysis.
More than 40% of all health care
expenditures attributed to diabetes come
from higher rates of hospital admission
and longer average lengths of stay per
admission, constituting the single largest
contributor to the attributed medical cost
of diabetes. Of the projected $475 billion
in national expenditures for hospital in-
patient care (including both facility and
professional services costs), approxi-
mately $124 billion (or 26%) is incurred
by people who have diabetes, of which
$76 billion is directly attributed to their
diabetes. Medications as a whole (pre-
scription medications, insulin, and other
antidiabetic agents) represent over one-
quarter (28%) of all health expenditures
attributed to diabetes. Of the projected
$286 billion in national cost for medica-
tions, $77 billion (27%) is incurred by
people with diabetes, of which $50 billion
is attributed to their diabetes.
Approximately 59% of all health care
expenditures attributed to diabetes are for
health resources used by the population
aged 65 years and older, much of which is
borne by the Medicare program (Table 5).
The population 45–64 years of age incurs
33% of diabetes-attributed costs, with the
remaining 8% incurred by the population
under 45 years of age. The annual attrib-
uted health care cost per person with di-
abetes (Table 6) increases with age,
primarily as a result of increased use of

hospital inpatient and nursing facility re-
sources, physician ofﬁce visits, and pre-
scription medications. Dividing the total
attributed health care expenditures by the
number of people with diabetes, we esti-
mate the average annual excess expendi-
tures for the population aged under 45
years, 45–64 years, and 65 years and
above, respectively, at $4,394, $5,611,
and $11,825. Total health care expendi-
tures are attributed to diabetes by sex and
race/ethnicity (Supplementary Table 6),
insurance status (Supplementary Table
9 and 10), and state (Supplementary Ta-
ble 11).
Table 7 summarizesdiabetes-attributed
health care expenditures for those cost
components modeled by medical con-
dition. Hospital inpatient is the largest
component of attributed costs followed
by physician ofﬁce visit. Across different
health care delivery settings, general med-
ical conditions and cardiovascular disease
categories are the two largest contributors
of total health care expenditures attrib-
uted to diabetes in addition to diabetes
itself. Together, the general medical con-
ditions and cardiovascular disease catego-
ries are responsible for 78% of hospital
inpatient costs attributed to diabetes,
47% of the cost for physician ofﬁce visits,
82% of the cost for emergency department
visits, and 52% of the cost for hospital
outpatient.
Figure 1 summarizes the proportion
of medical expenditures attributed to di-
abetes for each chronic complication over
the total U.S. health care expenditure
combining expenditures for hospital in-
patient, hospital outpatient, emergency
department visits, physician ofﬁce visits,
and prescription medications. Over a
quarter of expenditures, in ﬁve out of
the eight conditions shown in the chart,
are attributed to diabetes. In addition, 7,
11, and 21% of national medical expendi-
turestreatinggeneralconditions,endocrine/
metabolic complications, and ophthal-
mic complications are attributable to
diabetes.
The population with diabetes is older
and sicker than the population without
diabetes, and consequently annual med-
ical expenditures are much higher (on
average) than for people without diabetes
(Table 8). After adjusting for age-sex dif-
ferences in these two populations, people
with diabetes have health care expendi-
tures that are 2.3 times higher ($13,741
vs. $5,853) than expenditures would be
expected for this same population in the
absence of diabetes. This suggests that di-
abetes is responsible for $7,888 in excess
expenditures per year per person with di-
abetes. This 2.3 multiple is unchanged
from the 2007 study.
Indirect costs attributed to diabetes
The total indirect cost of diabetes is
estimated at $68.6 billion (Table 9). The
majority of this burden comes from un-
employment due to permanent disability
($21.6 billion), presenteeism ($20.8 bil-
lion), and premature mortality ($18.5 bil-
lion). Workdays absent ($5.0 billion) and
reduced productivity for those not in the
workforce ($2.7 billion) represent a rela-
tively small portion of the total burden.
Our logistic regression analysis with
NHIS data suggests that diabetes is asso-
ciated with a 2.4 percentage point in-
crease in the likelihood of leaving the
workforce for disability. This equates to
approximately 541,000 working-age
adults leaving the workforce prematurely
and 130 million lost workdays in 2012.
For the population that leaves the work-
force early because of diabetes-associated
disability, we estimate that their average
daily earnings would have been $166 per
person (with the amount varying by de-
mographic).
Presenteeism accounted for 30% of
the indirect cost of diabetes. The estimate
of a 6.6% annual decline in productivity
attributed to diabetes (in excess of the
estimated decline in the absence of di-
abetes) equates to 113 million lost work-
days per year. The average daily earnings
are $185 for the employed population
with diabetes, which equates to $20.8 bil-
lion in annual cost attributed to diabetes
(after factoring out absenteeism to pre-
vent double counting).
The estimated number of deaths in
2012 attributable to diabetes is 246,000
(Table 10). For 73,000 deaths (30%), di-
abetes is listed as the primary cause. Of
the 687,000 deaths where cardiovascular
disease is listed as the primary cause, ap-
proximately 110,000 (16%) are attribut-
able to diabetes. Approximately 38,000
cases where cerebrovascular disease is
listed as the primary cause of death are
attributable to diabetes, and 25,000 cases
where renal disease is listed as the primary
cause of death are attributable to diabetes.
The average cost per premature death de-
clines with age (reﬂecting fewer remain-
ing expected working years), and across
all premature deaths averaged approxi-
mately $75,100 per case.

Figure 2 summarizes estimates of
PVFP if a person dies at that age. PVFP
is the value in 2012 of expected future
lifetime earnings if the person had lived
to the average age as the cohort born in
the same year. The differences in PVFP by
demographic reﬂect the differences in av-
erage earnings, the propensity to be in the
workforce, and the number of years ex-
pected to remain in the workforce.
The cost of missed workdays due to
absenteeism is estimated at $5.0 billion,
representing 25 million days. If people
not in the workforce have similar rates
of days where they are unable to work
due to poor health as their employed
peers, this would equate to 20 million ex-
cess sick days with the estimated produc-
tivity loss valued at $2.7 billion. We do
not count productivity loss for the popu-
lation under age 18 years. While children
constitute a small proportion of the pop-
ulation with diabetes, omitting produc-
tivity loss associated with diabetes
among children will tend to bias low the
cost estimates. For example, the eco-
nomic cost associated with parents who
take time off from work to take their chil-
dren to the doctor for diabetes-related vis-
its is omitted from these cost estimates.
The average annual productivity loss
per person aged 18 years or older with
diabetes is $3,100. Table 11 shows that
per capita estimates range from a high of
$6,844 for men aged 45–54 years to a low
of $647 for women aged 70 years and
olderdreﬂecting differences by demo-
graphic in propensity to be in the work-
force, average earnings, and mortality
risk. Supplementary Table 7 shows the
annual productivity loss per person with
diabetes by cause and race/ethnicity.
CONCLUSIONSdThis study found
that there were more than 22.3 million
people (about 7% of the U.S. population)
with diagnosed diabetes in the U.S. in
2012. This is substantially higher than the
2007 estimate of 17.5 million people,
reﬂecting changing demographics, in-
crease in the prevalence of risk factors
including obesity, decreasing mortality,
and improvements in the detection of
diabetes (29–32). Diabetes costs the
nation a total of $245 billion, which in-
cludes $176 billion in direct medical cost
and $69 billion in lost productivity.
While the majority (59%) of direct med-
ical cost is for the population aged 65
years and over, about 88% of indirect
cost is borne by the population under
65 years of age. We also found that after
adjusting for age and sex, annual per cap-
ita health care expenditure is 2.3 times
higher for people with diabetes than for
those without diabetes. Diabetes is espe-
cially costly when it is associated with
complications. While we were unable to
calculate diabetes-attributed cost by com-
plication groups for every cost compo-
nent across the major health care
delivery settings (hospital inpatient and
outpatient, physician ofﬁce, and emer-
gency department), from 25% (emer-
gency department) to 45% (hospital
inpatient) of the diabetes-attributed med-
ical expenditures were spent treating
complications of diabetes. Other studies
found that people with uncontrolled di-
abetes or with diabetes complications in-
cur diabetes costs two to eight times more
than people with controlled or nonad-
vanced diabetes (33,34).
For comparison, the $174 billion es-
timate of the total burden for 2007 pub-
lished previously is equivalent to $202
billion when inﬂated to 2012 dollars us-
ing the average general inﬂation rate of
3%. The increase of $43 billion from the
2007 estimate in 2012 dollars to the new
estimate of $245 billion reﬂects 1) a 27%
growth in diabetes prevalence, 2) chang-
ing demographics of people with diabe-
tes, 3) growth in the utilization of certain
types of health care services for treating
diabetes and its comorbidities such as in-
creased use of prescription medications
and advanced treatment for cardiovascu-
lar disease, 4) rising prices for medical
goods and services above the general
rate of inﬂation, and 5) reﬁnements to
the data and methods used to calculate
the cost of diabetes.
We found that the proportions of to-
tal national health services use attributed
to diabetes and incurred by people with
diabetes both increased from the esti-
mates in the 2007 study, including utili-
zation of nursing/residential facility days,
physician ofﬁce visits, emergency depart-
ment visits, hospital outpatient visits, and
prescription medications. The number of
hospital inpatient days incurred by peo-
ple with diabetes and those that are at-
tributable to their diabetes have both
increased from the 2007 level by about
6 and 9%, respectively, although the na-
tional utilization of hospital inpatient
care has decreased by about 10% from
186 million days in 2007 to 168 million
days in 2012 based on the analysis of
NIS data.

Additionally, even when using MEPS
data that have been shown to underesti-
mate costs when compared with claims
data, especially for the privately insured
(35), we found that the price of medical
services per event (visit or day) has in-
creased by 5–17% over the rate of general
inﬂation from the 2007 level for hospital
inpatient, hospital outpatient, emergency
department, insulin, and other prescrip-
tion medications. Due to the increase in
diabetes prevalence, health resource utili-
zation, and average per event cost of services,
the $176 billion direct medical cost attrib-
uted to diabetes in 2012 is 30% higher
than the general inﬂation-adjusted 2007
direct medical cost of $135 billion.
The indirect cost estimate of $69 bil-
lion for 2012 includes increased ab-
senteeism ($5 billion) and reduced
productivity while at work ($20.8 billion)
for the employed population, reduced
productivity for those not in the labor
force ($2.7 billion), unemployment as a
result of disease-related disability ($21.6
billion), and lost productive capacity
due to early mortality ($18.5 billion).
The $69 billion is only 3% higher than
the inﬂation-adjusted 2007 estimate of
$67 billion, despite the 27% growth in
diabetes prevalence. Factors depressing
the 2012 estimate include the decline
in the number of people participating in
the workforce in 2012 and the lower
diabetes-attributed mortality estimates for
2012. Including race/ethnicity as a study
dimension also depressed the national in-
direct burden estimate relative to 2007, as
Hispanics and non-Hispanic blacks have
higher diabetes prevalence rates but lower
labor force participation rates and lower
average earnings. Since the 2007 study,
the economic downturn has decreased
overall rates of employment across all de-
mographic groups regardless of diabetes
status. A declining proportion of the adult
population in the workforce depresses the
estimates of absenteeism and presenteeism,
while increasing the estimates of diabetes-
related productivity losses for the popula-
tion not in the workforce.
Our estimate of $245 billion only rep-
resents the economic cost of diagnosed
diabetes. An earlier study found that 6.3
million U.S. adults have undiagnosed di-
abetes with an associated cost of $18 bil-
lion in 2007 (36). Furthermore, nearly 57
million adults in that study were esti-
mated to have prediabetes, a precursor
to diabetes, costing an additional $25 bil-
lion in higher medical spending (37,38).
On the surface it appears that the ﬁnancial
burden of diabetes falls primarily on in-
surers who pay a substantial portion of
medical costs, employers who experience
productivity loss, and the people with di-
abetes and their families who incur higher
out-of-pocket medical costs and reduced
earnings potential or employment oppor-
tunities. Ultimately, though, the burden is
passed along to all of society in the form of
higher insurance premiums and taxes,

reduced earnings, and reduced standard
of living.
The cost estimates presented might
be conservative for several reasons:
c Due to data limitations, we omitted
from this analysis the potential increase
in the use of over-the-counter medi-
cations and optometry and dental
services. Diabetes increases the risk of
periodontal disease, so one would ex-
pect dental costs to be higher for people
with diabetes. We explored the MEPS
data for the feasibility of capturing op-
tometry and dental costs, but the small
sample
sizes
prevented
meaningful
analyses. Also omitted from the cost
estimates are expenditures for the pre-
vention programs targeted to people
with diabetes (e.g., disease management
programs), research activities (e.g., to
develop new drugs), and administra-
tion costs (e.g., to administer the
Medicare and Medicaid programs, to
process insurance claims). Administra-
tion costs for government health pro-
grams and private insurers are ; $150
billion per year. Public and private ex-
penditures for medical research and
health infrastructure total over $130
billion per year (39). If a portion of
these costs were attributed to diabetes,
the national cost of diabetes would be
billions of dollars higher than our esti-
mate suggests.
c Also omitted from the cost estimates
are the intangible costs of diabetes such
as pain, suffering, and reduced quality
of life, as well as some of the non-
medical costs attributed to diabetes.

renal complications, or lower-extremity
amputations often require their homes
and/or motor vehicles to be modiﬁed to
accommodate their daily activity needs.
Diabetes is the leading cause of new cases
of blindness among adults aged 20–74
years (23), and the CDC estimates that
roughly 65,700 lower-limb amputations
are performed each year on people with
diabetes (23). The nonmedical cost asso-
ciated with these disabilities could further
increase the total burden of diabetes.
c The lost productivity estimates are for
those individuals with diagnosed di-
abetes and exclude lost productivity
associated with the care for family
members with diabetes. For example,
the productivity loss associated with
adults who take time off from work to
care for a child or an elderly parent with
diabetes is not included in the cost es-
timates. The value of informal caregiv-
ing is excluded from our cost estimate.
Time and costs associated with travel-
ing to doctor visits and other medical
emergencies are omitted (except to the
extent that such costs are partially
captured under ambulance costs and
the absenteeism estimate for those in
the workforce).
c Our estimate of lost productivity at-
tributed to chronic disability from di-
abetes is also likely to be conservative
due to three factors: 1) using SSI pay-
ments to identify cases of disability
likely underestimates disability cases
because the criteria for SSI eligibility
include requirements for documenta-
tion of disability from a health pro-
fessional and apply income limits; 2)
these estimates omit the value of pro-
ductivity loss that results in reduced
earnings potential but does not prevent
working; and 3) productivity loss as-
sociated with early retirement is not
included, and a longitudinal study us-
ing the Health and Retirement Survey
found that people with diabetes tend to
retire ;1.2 years earlier than their
peers without diabetes (40).
One challenge for this study was to
control for the correlation between di-
abetes and the use of health resources for
reasons not directly attributed to diabetes.
Health behavior that affects both the
presence of diabetes and the presence of
other comorbidities, unless controlled
for, could result in an overestimation of
the link between diabetes and the use of
health resources. Controlling for age, sex,
and race/ethnicity helps to control for this
correlation. In addition, for the top 10
cost drivers, we conducted additional
analysis controlling for other important
explanatory variables using the MEPS
data. Based on the results, we reduced
the etiological fractions for several diabe-
tes complications and for the general
medical conditions group depending on
the setting of care. This potential limita-
tion also applies to the estimates of in-
direct costs attributed to diabetes,
especially the estimated productivity
loss due to presenteeism.
Other study limitations discussed
previously include small sample size for
some data sources used, the use of a data
source (dNHI) that overrepresents the
commercially insured population for the
population younger than age 65 years,
and the need to use different approaches
to model different cost components be-
cause of data limitations. Another limita-
tion common to claims-based analysis is
the possibility of inaccurate diagnosis
codes. Claims data tend to be less accurate
than medical records in identifying pa-
tients with speciﬁc conditions due to
reasons such as rule-out diagnosis, cod-
ing error, etc. The direction of such bias
on our risk ratio calculations is unknown,
although it is anticipated to be small as
there is no reason to believe that the
coding of comorbidities would be signif-
icantly different for people with and
without diabetes.
Using a methodology that is largely
consistent with our previous cost of di-
abetes study in 2007 with updated na-
tional survey and claims data from
previous data sources, we estimated the
total burden of diabetes in 2012. The
estimates presented here show that di-
abetes places an enormous burden on
societydboth in the economic terms pre-
sented here and in reduced quality of life.
The overall cost of diabetes estimates are
consistentwithearlierestimatesafteradjust-
ing for the increasing prevalence of diabetes
and price increases (though estimates for
some cost components and medical condi-
tions differ from the earlier study).
A recent study estimates that preva-
lence of diagnosed diabetes is likely to at
least double between 2010 and 2050, and

the prevalence of total diabetes (diag-
nosed and undiagnosed) may increase
from the 2010 level of about one in nine
adults to between one in ﬁve and one in
three adults in 2050 (3,41).
This study highlights the large eco-
nomic burden of diabetes and its compli-
cations on the individual and the health
care system. Cost estimates from 2002,
2007, and now 2012 show that the
burden is increasingdeven after control-
ling for population growth and inﬂation.
Cost comparisons by age-group show
that the burden of diabetes increases
with age. These trends underscore the im-
portance of prevention and the efforts to
mitigate the complications of diabetes.

Data sources: analysis of the NHIS (2009–2011), CPS (2011), and CDC mortality data. Note: Age ,18 years is not included as no indirect costs are calculated for
persons under the age of 18. For the age 70 years and older population, the rate of labor force participation is low so indirect costs are relatively low for this population
despite high prevalence of diabetes. The NHIS sample size of employed people over age 70 years is small, and regression analysis with the NHIS found that diabetes is
not associated with increased workdays absent for illness among the employed population aged 70 years and older. We conservatively assume that for the population
aged 65 years and older and not in the workforce there is no loss in societal productivity (e.g., from volunteer work) associated with diabetes.
