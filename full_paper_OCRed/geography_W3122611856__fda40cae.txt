Government Spending in a Simple Model 
of Endogenous Growth 
Robert J. Barro 
Harvard University and National Bureau of Economic Research 
One strand of endogenous-growth 
models assumes constant returns 
to a broad concept of capital. I extend these models to include tax- 
financed 
government 
services that affect production 
or utility. 
Growth and saving rates fall with an increase in utility-type expendi- 
tures; the two rates rise initially with productive government expen- 
ditures but subsequently 
decline. With an income tax, the decen- 
tralized choices of growth and saving are "too low," but if the 
production 
function is Cobb-Douglas, the optimizing government 
still satisfies a natural condition for productive efficiency. Empirical 
evidence across countries supports some of the hypotheses about 
government and growth. 
Recent 
models 
of economic 
growth 
can generate 
long-term 
growth 
without 
relying 
on exogenous 
changes 
in technology 
or population.
