Global, regional, and national burden of stroke and its risk 
factors, 1990–2019: a systematic analysis for the Global 
Burden of Disease Study 2019 
GBD 2019 Stroke Collaborators*
Summary
Background Regularly updated data on stroke and its pathological types, including data on their incidence, prevalence, 
mortality, disability, risk factors, and epidemiological trends, are important for evidence-based stroke care planning 
and resource allocation. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) aims to provide a 
standardised and comprehensive measurement of these metrics at global, regional, and national levels.
Methods We applied GBD 2019 analytical tools to calculate stroke incidence, prevalence, mortality, disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs), and the population attributable fraction (PAF) of DALYs (with corresponding 95% uncertainty 
intervals [UIs]) associated with 19 risk factors, for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019. These estimates 
were provided for ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, subarachnoid haemorrhage, and all strokes 
combined, and stratified by sex, age group, and World Bank country income level.
Findings In 2019, there were 12·2 million (95% UI 11·0–13·6) incident cases of stroke, 101 million (93·2–111) 
prevalent cases of stroke, 143 million (133–153) DALYs due to stroke, and 6·55 million (6·00–7·02) deaths from 
stroke. Globally, stroke remained the second-leading cause of death (11·6% [10·8–12·2] of total deaths) and the 
third-leading cause of death and disability combined (5·7% [5·1–6·2] of total DALYs) in 2019. From 1990 to 2019, the 
absolute number of incident strokes increased by 70·0% (67·0–73·0), prevalent strokes increased by 85·0% 
(83·0–88·0), deaths from stroke increased by 43·0% (31·0–55·0), and DALYs due to stroke increased by 32·0% 
(22·0–42·0). During the same period, age-standardised rates of stroke incidence decreased by 17·0% (15·0–18·0), 
mortality decreased by 36·0% (31·0–42·0), prevalence decreased by 6·0% (5·0–7·0), and DALYs decreased by 
36·0% (31·0–42·0). However, among people younger than 70 years, prevalence rates increased by 22·0% (21·0–24·0) 
and incidence rates increased by 15·0% (12·0–18·0). In 2019, the age-standardised stroke-related mortality rate was 
3·6 (3·5–3·8) times higher in the World Bank low-income group than in the World Bank high-income group, and 
the age-standardised stroke-related DALY rate was 3·7 (3·5–3·9) times higher in the low-income group than the 
high-income group. Ischaemic stroke constituted 62·4% of all incident strokes in 2019 (7·63 million [6·57–8·96]), 
while intracerebral haemorrhage constituted 27·9% (3·41 million [2·97–3·91]) and subarachnoid haemorrhage 
constituted 9·7% (1·18 million [1·01–1·39]). In 2019, the five leading risk factors for stroke were high systolic blood 
pressure (contributing to 79·6 million [67·7–90·8] DALYs or 55·5% [48·2–62·0] of total stroke DALYs), high body-
mass index (34·9 million [22·3–48·6] DALYs or 24·3% [15·7–33·2]), high fasting plasma glucose (28·9 million 
[19·8–41·5] DALYs or 20·2% [13·8–29·1]), ambient particulate matter pollution (28·7 million [23·4–33·4] DALYs or 
20·1% [16·6–23·0]), and smoking (25·3 million [22·6–28·2] DALYs or 17·6% [16·4–19·0]).
Interpretation The annual number of strokes and deaths due to stroke increased substantially from 1990 to 2019, 
despite substantial reductions in age-standardised rates, particularly among people older than 70 years. The highest 
age-standardised stroke-related mortality and DALY rates were in the World Bank low-income group. The fastest-
growing risk factor for stroke between 1990 and 2019 was high body-mass index. Without urgent implementation of 
effective primary prevention strategies, the stroke burden will probably continue to grow across the world, particularly 
in low-income countries.

Introduction 
Disease and population distribution patterns, life 
expectancy, mortality, causes of death, and socio-
demographic factors continue to change across the 
world, including ageing of populations and changes in 
the prevalence of risk factors for non-communicable 
disorders. Timely estimates of the burden of stroke and 
its pathological types, the burden attributable to risk 
factors, and trends in the burden over time are necessary 
at the global, regional, and national levels to guide

evidence-based health-care policy, planning, and resource 
allocation for stroke.
The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk 
Factors Study (GBD) 2017 showed that stroke was the 
third-leading cause of death and disability combined (as 
measured by disability-adjusted life-years [DALYs]) and the 
second-leading cause of death in the world in 2017.1,2 A 
GBD 2017 stroke analysis found that, although 
age-standardised mortality rates for stroke decreased 
sharply from 1990 to 2017,2 the decrease in age-standardised 
incidence was much less steep, suggesting that prevention 
efforts have been less successful than treatment efforts. 
The results from GBD 20163 showed that 87·9% of 
ischaemic stroke DALYs and 89·5% of haemorrhagic 
stroke DALYs were due to potentially modifiable risk 
factors measured in GBD, demonstrating the enormous 
potential to reduce the burden of stroke through reductions 
in risk factor exposure. According to WHO, effective stroke 
prevention strategies include reducing the risk associated 
with hypertension (high systolic blood pressure), elevated 
lipids, diabetes (high fasting plasma glucose), smoking, 
low physical activity, unhealthy diet, and abdominal obesity 
(high body-mass index [BMI]),4 which is similar to the 
findings from GBD 20163 and GBD 2017.5
In this study, we estimated the global, regional, and 
national burden of overall stroke, ischaemic stroke, 
intracerebral haemorrhage, and subarachnoid haem­
orrhage in terms of their incidence, prevalence, mortality, 
and DALYs, as well as stroke-related DALYs associated 
with 19 potentially modifiable behavioural, environmental 
and occupational, and metabolic risk factors or groups of 
risk factors. We present data for 204 countries and 
territories, 21 GBD regions, and four World Bank income 
level groups from 1990 to 2019, by age group and sex. 
This manuscript was produced as part of the GBD 
Collaborator Network and in accordance with the GBD 
Protocol. 
Methods
Overview and case definition 
Details of the GBD 2019 eligibility criteria, the literature 
search strategy, and data extraction are described in detail 
elsewhere6,7 (appendix sections 1.1–4.3). In brief, stroke 
was defined by WHO clinical criteria8 as rapidly 
developing clinical signs of (usually focal) disturbance of 
cerebral function lasting more than 24 h or leading to 
death. Ischaemic stroke was defined as an episode of 
neurological dysfunction due to focal cerebral, spinal, 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 
(GBD) produces the most comprehensive estimates of the global, 
regional, and country-specific burden of stroke. Population-level 
estimates for stroke incidence or mortality have been published 
by WHO and independent research groups, but those of GBD 
include more extensive estimates by age, sex, location, and year. 
To evaluate the availability of evidence, we did a structured 
review of the published scientific literature in Medline, Scopus, 
Google Scholar, and PubMed for relevant reports published in any 
language up to June 30, 2021, using search terms that included 
“stroke”, “cerebral infarction”, “isch(a)emic stroke”, “intracerebral 
h(a)emorrage”, “h(a)emorrhagic stroke”, or “subarachnoid h(a)
emorrage”, AND “incidence”, “prevalence”, “mortality”, or 
“epidemiology” or “population attributable fraction (PAF)”, “risk 
factor(s)”, or “disability-adjusted life-year(s) (DALYs)”. GBD 2017 
included stroke in its analysis, but the most recent paper by the 
GBD Collaborator Network on the topic of stroke was from GBD 
2016. The report concluded that because the decrease in global 
age-standardised incidence rates from 1990 to 2016 was 
minimal, the burden of stroke was likely to remain high well into 
the future.
Added value of this study
As part of GBD 2019, this study provides updated estimates of 
the burden of overall stroke, ischaemic stroke, intracerebral 
haemorrhage, and subarachnoid haemorrhage for 
204 countries and territories in 21 GBD regions from 1990 
to 2019, by age, sex, and country income level (by the World 
Bank classification). Stroke burden was measured by incidence, 
prevalence, mortality, and DALYs as well as the PAF of 
stroke-related DALYs associated with potentially modifiable 
behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic 
risk factors or risk factor clusters. Until GBD 2017, intracerebral 
haemorrhage and subarachnoid haemorrhage were not 
estimated separately, so this is the first report by the GBD 
Collaborator Network to present the global, regional, and 
national burden of haemorrhagic strokes by intracerebral 
haemorrhage and subarachnoid haemorrhage separately. 
This study is also the first systematic analysis to determine the 
effect of non-optimal temperature on stroke burden.
Implications of all the available evidence
The findings from this study can help guide evidence-based 
health-care planning, prevention, and resource allocation for 
stroke and its pathological types, including country-specific 
prioritisation of these measures. By evaluating the 
risk-attributable burden of different stroke types in different 
geographical locations, this study can be used to develop 
location-specific strategies for reducing the burden of stroke. 
Based on the available evidence, public health and research 
priorities should include: expanding evidence-based 
prevention strategies that reduce exposure to stroke risk 
factors; reducing the gaps in acute and chronic stroke 
prevention, screening, and treatment services between 
high-income and low-income to middle-income countries; 
and further epidemiological research on stroke risk and 
outcomes across different countries and populations.

or retinal infarction. Intracerebral haemorrhage was 
defined as stroke with a focal collection of blood in the 
brain not due to trauma. Subarachnoid haemorrhage was 
defined as non-traumatic stroke due to bleeding into the 
subarachnoid space of the brain. The GBD methods for 
assigning cause of death to stroke and stroke subtypes in 
regions where neuroimaging was not available have been 
previously described.9 GBD classifies causes into four 
levels, from the broadest (Level 1; eg, non-communicable 
diseases), to the most specific (Level 4; eg, intracerebral 
haemorrhage). Stroke is a Level 3 cause, within the 
Level  2 category of cardiovascular diseases, while its 
subtypes are Level 4 causes.
Fatal disease modelling 
We used vital registration and verbal autopsy data as 
inputs into the Cause of Death Ensemble modelling 
(CODEm) framework to estimate deaths due to overall 
stroke and stroke subtypes. CODEm is a flexible 
modelling tool that utilises geospatial relationships and 
information from covariates to produce estimates of 
death for all locations across the time series (1990–2019). 
Deaths from vital registration systems coded to 
impossible or intermediate causes of death or unspecified 
stroke were reassigned by use of statistical methods 
(appendix sections 1.4, 1.7, 1.8).10
Non-fatal disease modelling 
Estimates of the incidence and prevalence of stroke were 
generated with the DisMod-MR 2.1 (disease-model-
Bayesian meta-regression) modelling tool.3 DisMod-MR 
is a Bayesian geospatial disease modelling software 
that uses data on various disease parameters, the 
epidemiological relationships between these parameters, 
and geospatial relationships to produce estimates of 
prevalence and incidence (appendix section 3). All 
available high-quality data on incidence, prevalence, and 
mortality were used to estimate non-fatal stroke burden. 
We modelled first-ever ischaemic stroke, intracerebral 
haemorrhage, and subarachnoid haemorrhage from the 
day of incidence through 28 days and separately modelled 
survival beyond 28 days.
Risk factor estimation 
To analyse the attributable burden of stroke due to 19 risk 
factors currently available for such analysis in GBD 2019, 
we calculated population attributable fractions (PAFs) of 
DALYs (appendix section 2).7 This work was done within 
the comparative risk assessments framework of GBD by 
use of four datasets: the burden estimates for stroke and 
its three pathological types; the exposure level for each 
risk factor; the relative risk of stroke as an outcome of 
exposure to the risk factor; and the theoretical minimum 
risk exposure level (TMREL), which is the level of 
exposure that minimises risk for each individual in the 
population.11 The relative risks included in this analysis 
were generated from meta-analyses of epidemiological 
studies reporting associations between the risk factors of 
interest and stroke; these analyses are not stroke-type 
specific. The PAF (estimated independently for each risk 
factor) is the proportion of the cause that would be 
decreased if the exposure to the risk factor in the past had 
been reduced to the counterfactual level of the TMREL.
Risks included in the analysis were ambient particulate 
matter pollution; household air pollution from solid fuels; 
non-optimal temperature—ie, low temperature (daily 
temperatures below the TMREL) and high temperature 
(daily temperatures above the TMREL); lead exposure; 
diet high in sodium; diet high in red meat; diet low in 
fruits; diet low in vegetables; diet low in whole grains; 
alcohol consumption (any dosage); low physical activity 
(only for ischaemic stroke burden); smoking; secondhand 
smoke; high BMI; high fasting plasma glucose; high 
systolic blood pressure; high LDL cholesterol (only for 
ischaemic stroke burden); and kidney dysfunction, as 
measured by low glomerular filtration rate (GFR; not 
assessed for subarachnoid haemorrhage burden). As 
with causes, GBD organises risk factors into four levels, 
from the broadest (Level 1) to the most specific (Level 4). 
In addition to the specific risk factors above, we assessed 
the Level 1 groups of risks: behavioural, environmental 
and occupational, and metabolic. The PAFs of risk factor 
groups took into account interactions between risk 
factors included in the group, as explained elsewhere.12 
Percentages and number of DALYs are not mutually 
exclusive. The crude sum of the PAF of the risk factors 
might exceed 100% because the effects of many of these 
risk factors are mediated partly or wholly through 
another risk factor or risk factors. Definitions of risk 
factors and risk groups and further details of risk factors 
are provided in the appendix (section 2.1).
Data sources and presentation 
For GBD 2019, we used data from 3686 vital registration 
sources, 147 verbal autopsy sources, 368 incidence sources, 
117 prevalence sources, 229 excess mortality sources, 
7753 risk factor exposure sources, and 2733 risk factor 
relative risk sources. Further details of the data sources 
used in this analysis are available on the Global Health 
Data Exchange website.

Results 
Overall stroke burden 
In 2019, there were 12·2 million (95% UI 11·0–13·6) 
incident strokes and 101 million (93·2–111) prevalent 
strokes, 143 million (133–153) DALYs due to stroke, and 
6·55 million (6·00–7·02) deaths from stroke (table 1). 
Globally, stroke was the second-leading Level 3 cause of 
death (11·6% [10·8–12·2] of total deaths) after ischaemic 
heart disease (16·2% [15·0–16·9]). Stroke was also the 
third-leading Level 3 cause of death and disability 
combined in 2019 (5·7% [5·1–6·2] of total DALYs), after 
neonatal disorders (7·3% [64·4–8·4]) and ischaemic 
heart disease (7·2% [6·5–8·0]; appendix section 4.1 and 
figure S2). In 2019, the World Bank low-income group of 
countries 
had 
an 
age-standardised 
stroke-related 
mortality rate 3·6 (3·5–3·8) times higher and an age-
standardised stroke-related DALY rate 3·7 (3·5–3·9) 
times higher than those of high-income countries (see 
appendix tables S1, S3, and S5 and figures S2–7 for more 
detailed results by country and World Bank income 
group). In 2019, 86·0% (85·9–86·9) of all stroke-related 
deaths and 89·0% (88·9–89·3) of stroke-related DALYs 
occurred in lower-income, lower-middle-income, and 
upper-middle-income countries (appendix table S1). 
There were substantial between-country variations 
(figure 1A) in age-standardised stroke incidence rates 
and regional variations (figure 2) in age-standardised 
incidence, prevalence, mortality, and DALY rates. The 
absolute number of incident strokes globally increased 
by 70·0% (67·0–73·0) from 1990 to 2019, whereas 
prevalent strokes increased by 85·0% (83·0–88·0), 
deaths from stroke increased by 43·0% (31·0–55·0), and 
DALYs due to stroke increased by 32·0% (22·0–42·0; 
table 1, appendix figure S3). Although absolute numbers 
increased over the study period, age-standardised rates 
all decreased between 1990 and 2019: by 17·0% 
(15·0–18·0) for incidence; by 6·0% (5·0–7·0) for 
prevalence; by 36·0% (31·0–42·0) for mortality; and by 
36·0% (31·0–42·0) for DALYs (table 1). However, among 
those younger than 70 years, age-specific stroke 
prevalence and incidence rates increased substantially 
over the study period (22·0% [21·0–24·0] increase in 
prevalence and 15·0% [12·0–18·0] increase in incidence; 
incidence data are shown in appendix figure 7, prevalence 
data are available on the Global Health Data Exchange).
Although the absolute number of DALYs due to stroke 
in males (76·9 million [95% UI 70·2–83·5]) exceeded 
that in females (66·4 million [60·5–72·3]) at the global 
level in 2019, the point estimates of incident and 
prevalent strokes were higher in females (6·44 million 
[5·81–7·17] incident strokes and 56·4 million [52·0–61·5] 
prevalent strokes) than in males (5·79 million [5·24–6·45] 
incident strokes and 45·0 million [41·1–49·3] prevalent

strokes), and there were no noticeable sex differences in 
the number of stroke-related deaths (appendix table S2). 
Although age-standardised incidence rates did not 
differ significantly between males and females, age-
standardised death rates were greater in males than in 
females (96·4 [87·6–104·2] per 100 000 vs 73·5 
[65·2–80·7] per 100 000) as were DALY rates (2024·3 
[1852·4–2195·6] per 100 000 vs 1531·3 [1397·1–1667·6] 
per 100 000; see appendix section 4.1 for details of 
age-specific trends by country).
Burden of pathological types of stroke 
Ischaemic stroke constituted 62·4% of all new strokes 
in 2019 (7·63 million [95% UI 6·57–8·96] strokes), 
intracerebral 
haemorrhage 
constituted 
27·9% 
(3·41 million [2·97–3·91]), and subarachnoid haemor­
rhage constituted 9·7% (1·18 million [1·01–1·39]; table 1). 
Intracerebral haemorrhage and subarachnoid haem­
orrhage showed larger reductions in age-standardised 
rates from 1990 to 2019 than ischaemic stroke (table 1; 
appendix section 4·2, tables S3–5, and figure S8). There 
were substantial between-country variations in the age-
standardised incidence (figures 1B–D), prevalence, 
mortality, and DALY rates (appendix figures S8–11) of 
these three pathological types of stroke by GBD regions, 
country income level, and sex (appendix section 4.2), 
with 
an 
almost 
two-fold 
greater 
proportion 
of 
intracerebral haemorrhage in World Bank low-income to 
upper-middle-income countries compared with high-
income countries (29·5% [28·4–30·3] vs 15·8% 
[15·5–16·2]), but a lower proportion of subarachnoid 
haemorrhage in low-income to upper-middle-income 
countries compared with high-income countries (7·9% 
[7·5–8·3] vs 19·7% [18·4–21·0]). 
Stroke-related DALYs attributable to risk factors 
GBD stroke estimates for 1990–2019 are available to 
download from the GBD Results Tool. In 2019, 87·0% 
(95% UI 84·2–89·8) of total stroke DALYs were 
attributable to the 19 risk factors modelled in GBD 2019. 
The PAF of DALYs attributable to all risk factors 
combined was similar for ischaemic stroke (85·7% 
[81·2–90·3]), 
intracerebral 
haemorrhage 
(88·7% 
[85·2–91·0]), and subarachnoid haemorrhage (84·6% 
[81·3–87·6]; appendix section 4.3 and tables S6–8). From 
1990 to 2019, the total number of stroke-related DALYs due 
to risk factors increased from 91·5 million (85·8–98·3) to 
125 million (115–134), with a decrease in the high-income 
group (from 16·4 million [15·4–17·4] in 1990 to 13·1 million 
[11·8–14·4] in 2019) and an increase in the low-income 
to upper-middle-income groups (from 75·1  million 
[68·5–82·3] DALYs in all three income groups combined 
in 1990 to 111 million [100·3–122·5] DALYs in 2019). From 
1990 to 2019, the largest increase in the age-standardised 
stroke PAF globally was for high BMI, increasing from 
15·4% (8·2–24·2) to 24·3% (15·7–33·2), a 57·8% increase. 
In other words, if high BMI exposure were reduced to its 
TMREL, there would be a 24·3% reduction in stroke in 
2019, compared to just a 15·4% reduction in 1990. Other 
risk factors with an increasing age-standardised stroke 
PAF from 1990 to 2019 included high systolic blood

a 6·7% increase) and high fasting plasma glucose (from 
14·4% [9·9–20·8] to 20·2% [13·8–29·1], a 40·3% increase). 
By contrast, from 1990 to 2019, the stroke PAF of ambient 
particulate matter with a diameter of <2·5 μm (known as 
PM2·5) pollution decreased from 32·5% (29·6–35·6) to 
20·1% (16·6–23·0; a 38·2% decrease), and that of dietary 
risks decreased from 32·6% (24·7–41·5) to 30·6% 
(22·6–39·8; a 6·1% decrease).
In 2019, there were moderate between-country 
(1·3 times), regional (as measured by 21 GBD regions), 
and country economic development level (as measured by 
the World Bank income groups) variations in the 
proportion of stroke-related DALYs and its DALYs related 
to stroke pathological types that were attributable to 
risk factors. Between-country variations were more 
pronounced for subarachnoid haemorrhage (figure 3;

proportion of stroke-related DALYs was observed in the 
World Bank low-income to upper-middle-income groups 
(ranging from 85·9% [95% UI 83·2–88·6] in the World 
bank low-income group to 87·3% [84·4–89·9] in the World 
Bank upper-middle-income group). From 1990 to 2019, 
there was an increase in the total number of stroke-related 
DALYs due to high BMI, high fasting plasma glucose, high 
LDL cholesterol, kidney dysfunction, a diet high in red 
meat, alcohol consumption, and second-hand smoking, 
but a decrease in DALYs due to smoking and a diet low in 
fruits and vegetables (appendix figure S15). There were 
also moderate variations in the ranking of risk factors by 
pathological types of stroke (figure 4; appendix figures 
S16–18). In 2019, the five leading specific risk factors 
contributing to stroke death and disability combined 
(DALYs) were high systolic blood pressure (79·6 million 
[67·7–90·8] attributable DALYs; 55·5% [48·2–62·0] of all 
stroke DALYs]), high BMI (34·9 million [22·3–48·6]; 
[24·3% [15·7–33·2]), high fasting plasma glucose 
(28·9 million [19·8–41·5]; 20·2% [13·8–29·1]), ambient 
particulate matter pollution (28·7 million [23·4–33·4]; 
20·1% 
[16·6–23·0]), 
and 
smoking 
(25·3 
million 
[22·6–28·2]; 17·6% [16·4–19·0]; table 2, figure 5). For risk 
factors by pathological type of stroke and changes in risk 
factor rankings from 1990 to 2019 by GBD regions, see the 
appendix (section 4.3 and figures S19–26).
Discussion 
In 2019, stroke remained the second-leading Level 3 
cause of death and the third-leading Level 3 cause of 
death and disability combined in the world, and its 
burden (in terms of the absolute number of cases) 
increased substantially from 1990 to 2019. Our findings 
indicate that the bulk of the global stroke burden (86·0% 
[95% UI 85·9–86·9] of deaths and 89·0% [88·9–89·3] of 
DALYs) is in lower-income and lower-middle-income 
countries. Globally, over the past three decades, the total 
number of stroke-related DALYs due to risk factors 
increased substantially (by 33·5 million, from 91·5 million 
in 1990 to 125 million in 2019), with diverging trends in 
World Bank high-income countries and low-income to 
upper-middle-income countries: a relatively small decrease 
in the high-income group and large increases in the 
low-income to upper-middle income groups. The large 
increase in the global burden of stroke was probably not 
only due to population growth and ageing but also because 
of the substantial increase in exposure to several important 
risk factors such as high BMI, ambient particulate matter 
pollution, high fasting plasma glucose, high systolic blood 
pressure, alcohol consumption, low physical activity, 
kidney dysfunction, and high temperature (appendix 
figure S26).7,14 This study is also the first systematic analysis 
to determine the effect of non-optimal temperature on

Data in parentheses are 95% uncertainty intervals. Count data in millions are presented to two decimal places and percentage data are presented to one decimal place. Percentages and number of DALYs are not 
mutually exclusive: the sum of percentages and number of DALYs in the columns exceeds the totals for all risk factors combined because of overlap between various risk factors. The crude sum of population 
attributable fraction (PAF) of the risk factors might exceed 100% because the effects of many of these risk factors are mediated partly or wholly through another risk factor or risk factors. DALY=disability-
adjusted life-year. PM2·5=particulate matter with a diameter of <25 μm. *Air pollution cluster includes ambient PM2·5 pollution and household air pollution from solid fuels. †Tobacco smoke cluster includes 
smoking and second-hand smoking. ‡Dietary risks cluster includes diet high in sodium, diet low in fruits, diet low in vegetables, diet high in red meat, and diet low in whole grains, and alcohol consumption. 
§Behavioural risks cluster includes smoking (including second-hand smoking), dietary risks (diet high in sodium, diet low in fruits, diet low in vegetables, diet high in red meat, diet low in whole grains, and 
alcohol consumption), and low physical activity. ¶Environmental risks cluster includes air pollution cluster, low ambient temperature, high ambient temperature, and lead exposure. ||Metabolic risks cluster 
includes high body-mass index, high fasting plasma glucose, high LDL cholesterol, high systolic blood pressure, and kidney dysfunction.

stroke burden. The greater age-standardised burden of 
stroke in World Bank low-income to upper-middle-
income countries than in the high-income countries 
might also relate to poorer acute health care for stroke,15 
poorer stroke awareness,16 and greater prevalence or 
effect of some risk factors (eg, tobacco use, poor diet, 
diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, rheumatic 
heart disease, dyslipidaemia, and obesity) in low-income 
countries than in upper-middle-income countries,17,18 
which highlights the inadequacy of primary prevention 
efforts in these settings.
For the first time, we have presented the global, 
regional, and national burden of stroke and its risk factors 
by its major pathological types. Although ischaemic

stroke continues to constitute the largest proportion of 
all new strokes (comprising 62·4% of all incident strokes 
in 2019), followed by intracerebral haemor­rhage (27·9%), 
and subarachnoid haemor­rhage (9·7%), the relative 
proportions of each pathological type varied substantially 
by income group. For example, a new stroke case was 
nearly twice as likely to be intracerebral haemorrhage in 
the World Bank low-income to upper-middle-income 
groups combined than in the high-income group (29·5% 
of all incident strokes in 2019 vs 15·8%), whereas a new 
stroke case was more than twice as likely to be sub­
arachnoid haemorrhage in the World Bank high-income 
group than in the low-income to upper-middle-income 
groups combined (19·7% vs 7·9%). The increased risk of 
intracerebral haemorrhage in low-income and upper-
middle-income countries might be related to the high 
relative clinical significance and population-attributable 
risk of hypertension in these countries.18 Our finding 
that a greater proportion of incident strokes in 
low-income to upper-middle-income countries are intra­
cerebral haemor­rhages in males than in females 
(appendix figure F6.9) are in line with previous 
observations,19,20 and might be explained by lower levels

to upper-middle-income countries than in high-income 
countries,18,21 as well as increased exposure to risk factors 
predisposing a higher proportion of males to intracerebral 
haemorrhage compared with females.20,22 Our study also 
adds to the body of research on the incidence of 
subarachnoid haemorrhage; a previous systematic review 
of population-based studies of subarachnoid haemor­
rhage incidence by Etminan and colleagues23 had similar 
findings to ours, as the authors used many of the same 
sources, but they only used crude incidence rates, which 
is perhaps why we found smaller between-country 
variations in the age-standardised incidence of sub­
arachnoid 
haemor­rhage 
(approximately 
a 
tenfold 
variation in our findings [appendix table s5] compared 
with a >20-fold variation in the systematic review).23 The 
size of between-country variations we observed in 
age-standardised incidence, prevalence, and DALY rates 
of other pathological types of stroke and stroke overall 
were in line with previous observations.2,3,19,20,24
Despite the overall declines in age-standardised stroke 
incidence, prevalence, death, and DALY rates, three 
concerning trends have emerged. First, the greatest 
share of the global burden of stroke continues to be 
borne by low-income to upper-middle-income countries. 
The proportion of DALYs attributable to GBD-modelled 
risk factors was also particularly high in low-income to 
upper-middle-income countries. Second, the pace of the 
global decline in age-standardised stroke incidence, 
death, and DALY rates was noticeably slower over the 
past decade (2010–19) than in the previous decade 
(2000–09), and global age-standardised prevalence 
significantly increased from 2010 to 2019 (appendix 
figure 6.8). There was a significant increase in stroke 
prevalence and incidence rates in people younger than 
70 years between 1990 and 2019 with even faster increases 
from 2010 to 2019 (appendix figure 6.7). A trend towards 
plateauing or increasing stroke incidence or mortality 
rates, or both, in middle-aged people was recently 
observed in the USA, European countries, Brazil, and 
China.25–30 This trend might be a reflection of the 
increased exposure to some risk factors for stroke, such 
as elevated blood pressure, high BMI, and high fasting 
plasma glucose, across most countries.31–33 In the USA, a 
worrisome trend observed in recent years (2017–18) is 
that awareness of hypertension in the population whose 
blood pressure is controlled is declining.34 Third, most 
countries have not achieved sufficient declines in stroke 
incidence rates to offset the demographic force of

population growth and ageing, resulting in overall 
increases in the number of incident, prevalent, fatal, and 
disabling strokes over time. A linear interpolation shows 
that if current trends continue, by 2050 there will be 
more than 200 million stroke survivors and almost 
300 million DALYs, 25 million new strokes, and 
13 million deaths from stroke annually. 
This study was, to our knowledge, the first systematic 
analysis to provide estimates of the burden of stroke and 
its subtypes associated with non-optimal temperature 
(daily temperatures below or above the TMREL). 
Although previous studies have made ecological 
observations of the effects of ambient temperature on the 
risk of stroke, this study was the first to show the sizeable 
global effect of non-optimal temperature (primarily low 
temperature, at 8·36 million [95% UI 6·19–10·80] DALYs 
or a PAF of 5·8% [4·4–7·5]) on the burden of stroke and 
its pathological types (appendix tables T10b, T11b, and 
T12b). These findings were in line with a recent 
systematic review on ambient temperature and stroke 
occurrence.35 Our estimates of geographical variations in 
the burden of stroke and its pathological types associated 
with non-optimal temperature and other risk factors 
suggest that country-specific and stroke type-specific 
priorities and strategies should be developed and 
implemented for reducing the burden of stroke in 
different geographical locations.
Our findings of the high proportion (87·0%) of 
age-standardised stroke-related DALYs associated with 
GBD risk factors are in line with previous observations17,36 
and highlight the potential to greatly reduce the stroke 
burden by addressing risk factor exposure. The increased 
contribution of certain metabolic risk factors in 2019 
compared with 1990 (eg, an increase in the proportional 
contribution to stroke-related DALYs of 57·8% by high 
BMI and 40·3% by high fasting plasma glucose) and a 
decreasing contribution of certain environmental and 
occupational and behavioural risk factors to the stroke-
related DALY burden over the same period (eg, a 
38·2% decrease for household air pollution from solid 
fuels and a 6·1% decrease for a diet low in vegetables) 
might be related to a growing proportion of the global 
population reaching the final stages of the epidemiological 
transition, in which the risk burden has shifted towards 
metabolic risk factors and an increased proportion of the 
disease burden comes from stroke and other non-
communicable diseases.37 This observation also means 
that guidance on reducing the risk of stroke by targeting 
certain risk factors will need to change to reflect changes 
in the risk-attributable profile.
Our estimates of the global, regional, and national 
burden of stroke and its pathological types and risk 
factors are important for evidence-based health-care 
planning, priority setting, and resource allocation for 
stroke care, primary prevention, and research. The high 
and increasing stroke burden alongside stagnant or even 
increasing mortality rates from cardiovascular disease in 
some countries,14 and increasing rates of exposure to 
many important stroke risk factors from 1990 to 2019,7,14 
suggest that current primary stroke prevention strategies 
and measures are not sufficient, and that efforts to 
implement 
population-wide 
primary 
prevention 
strategies more widely must be reinforced worldwide.38 
For every US$1 spent on prevention of stroke and 
cardiovascular disease, there is an estimated $10·9 
return on investment.39 Population-wide interventions 
for primary prevention of stroke and cardiovascular 
disease should include measures to reduce exposure to 
metabolic risk factors (eg, screening for and proper 
management of systolic blood pressure and weight), 
behavioural 
risk 
factors 
(eg, 
smoking 
cessation 
programmes 
and 
programmes 
to 
increase 
the 
accessibility and affordability of nutrient-rich foods), and 
environmental and occupational risk factors (eg, 
measures to reduce air pollution and lead exposure). The 
development and implementation of such population-
level interventions, alongside efforts to reduce poverty 
and racial and socioeconomic inequities, through 
legislation, taxation, and other measures at the 
government level, must be the mainstream approach for 
reducing the risk of stroke, cardiovascular disease, and 
other non-communicable diseases, but the importance of 
primary prevention measures at the individual level 
should not be overlooked. In this respect, the emphasis 
should be on strategies that are appropriate for most 
people at risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease 
regardless of their level of risk exposure,38 such as digital 
health technologies for affordable identification of people 
at increased risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease, 
universal health coverage, cheap and effective multidrug 
regimens (eg, polypills) for people at increased risk of 
cardiovascular disease, and involvement of health-care 
volunteers in primary prevention activities. For example, 
the World Stroke Organization recommends that all 
adults know their individual risk of having a stroke, their 
personal risk factors for stroke, and how to control these 
risk factors using the validated, internationally endorsed, 
and free Stroke Riskometer app, which is currently 
available in 19 languages for more than 70% of the global 
population.40 A recent Cochrane systematic review 
showed the feasibility and potential effectiveness of 
several health promotion interventions targeting risk 
factors to achieve behavioural changes for primary 
prevention of cardiovascular disease in low-income to 
upper-middle-income countries.41 Although knowledge 
of personal risk and management of behavioural risk 
factor activities is primarily the prerogative of 
individuals, health professionals have a responsibility to 
identify risk factors that require pharmacological and 
non-pharma­cological treatment to reduce the chance of 
stroke occurrence (eg, elevated blood pressure, atrial 
fibrillation, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, or symptomatic 
carotid artery stenosis). Simple, inexpensive screening 
for cardiovascular disease risks (eg, elevated blood

health 
professionals in low-income and middle-income settings 
or more accurate screening for high cardiovascular 
disease risks (including blood lipid tests) by health 
professionals in higher-income locations can help to 
identify people who might require prophylactic drug 
therapy, in conjunction with behavioural interventions.40 
However, health professionals often do not have enough 
time to conduct detailed assessments of behavioural risk 
factors or to develop individually tailored recom­
mendations for primary prevention of stroke and cardio­
vascular disease. To ameliorate this problem, data on 
stroke risk and risk factors from individuals should be 
integrated with the electronic patient management 
systems of health service providers. A study in Finland 
suggests that the quality of stroke prevention by primary 
health-care professionals could be improved by developing 
digital clinical decision-making tools and by implementing 
inter-professional teamwork42 (eg, the PreventS web app 
currently being developed in New Zealand). All of these 
measures should be facilitated by ongoing, culturally 
appropriate health education campaigns (including 
coordinated activities of non-governmental organisations) 
and inclusion of such health education information into 
standardised educational curricula at all levels.
In addition to primary stroke prevention efforts, 
appropriate secondary prevention efforts and adequate 
acute treatment and rehabilitation are essential to improve 
stroke outcomes. Our findings of large geographical 
variations in stroke prevalence, mortality, and disability 
are a reflection not only of geographical differences in 
stroke incidence but also of major inequities in acute 
stroke care and rehabilitation across countries.43 Even in 
European countries, only 7·3% of all patients with acute 
ischaemic stroke receive intravenous thrombolysis and 
only 1·9% receive endovascular treatment, with the 
highest country-level rates being 20·6% for intravenous 
thrombolysis (in the Netherlands) and 5·6% for 
endovascular treatment (in Malta),44 and one in three 
patients discontinues using one or more secondary stroke 
prevention drugs about 1 year after stroke.45 Treatment 
rates are even lower in many low-income and middle-
income countries.21,43 To reduce inequalities in stroke care, 
a roadmap for delivering quality stroke care and various 
action plans46,47 have been suggested, with emphasis on 
the importance of applying culturally appropriate and 
context-appropriate strategies. There is a pressing need 
to implement evidence-based guidelines for stroke 
management and to reduce the gap in stroke care between 
high-income countries and low-income and middle-
income countries. Recent evidence suggests that 
delivering an adequate level of stroke care48,49 and 
preventive interventions49 in low-income and middle-
income countries are feasible. Attention should be paid to 
developing the workforce for stroke care and setting up 
affordable 
and 
accessible 
rehabilitation 
facilities. 
Promising results50 suggest that self-management could 
be used as an adjunct strategy for ongoing rehabilitation 
at home or in other settings. The importance of country-
based ongoing stroke registries and stroke risk factors 
surveys, which are profoundly lacking in low-income and 
middle-income countries, should also be emphasised.
Although this study was, to our knowledge, the first 
and most comprehensive review of the global, regional, 
and national burden of stroke and its 19 specific risk 
factors by all three pathological types, it was not free 
from limitations common to all previous GBD estimates 
of stroke risk and risk factors,2,3,11,36 particularly the 
absence of original, good-quality stroke epidemiological 
studies for most countries. We therefore were not able to 
include some important potential risk factors (eg, atrial 
fibrillation and substance abuse), or include different 
patterns in risk factor exposure (eg, different doses and 
types of alcohol consumption, pack-years of smoking) 
and doses of exposure, analyse stroke burden by 
ischaemic stroke subtypes, or do a decomposition 
analysis to attribute changes in stroke burden to changes 
in the population growth, ageing, and risk factors 
separately. Additionally, evidence for the selection of 
TMRELs for some risk factors was uncertain and based 
on non-experimental studies, although all TMRELs were 
discussed and approved by a team of risk epidemiologists 
and stroke experts. Despite these limitations, our results 
are broadly consistent with previous estimates from 
population-based and analytical epidemiological studies, 
thus supporting the validity of our results.
In summary, although strokes are largely preventable, 
as indicated by declining incidence rates globally, stroke 
remained the second-leading cause of death and third-
leading cause of death and disability combined worldwide 
in 2019. Without wider implementation of population-
wide primary stroke and cardiovascular disease pre­
vention strategies, the burden of stroke is likely to 
continue growing, disproportionally affecting low-
income and middle-income countries. As the 19 analysed 
risk factors for stroke are common for other major non-
communicable diseases, appropriate control of these risk 
factors will also reduce the burden of coronary heart 
disease, vascular dementia, type 2 diabetes, and even 
some types of cancer. Further research on the frequency, 
outcomes, and determinants of stroke and its pathological 
types in different locations and over time is warranted. 
Such research could include identifying populations at 
highest risk as well as further investigating differences 
in stroke pathological types and their geographical 
patterns, all of which would be useful for more targeted 
prevention and treatment efforts. Closing the gaps 
between high-income countries and low-income and 
middle-income countries in the adaptation and imple­
mentation of internationally recognised guidelines and 
recom­mendations for reducing stroke morbidity and 
mortality, with an emphasis on primary prevention 
strategies, is crucial to addressing the global stroke 
burden.
