Preface 
The objective of this book is to provide a synthesis of 
the methods used in microfacies studies of carbonate 
rocks and to show how the application of microfacies 
sturlies has contributed to new developments in car-
bonate geology. In contrast with other textbooks on car-
bonate sedimentology this book focuses on those com-
positional and textural constituents of carbonates that 
reflect the depositional and diagenetic history and de-
termine the practical usefulness of carbonate rocks. 
The chapters are written in such a way, that each 
one can be used as text in upper level undergraduate 
and graduate courses. The topics of the book also ap-
ply to research workers and exploration geologists, 
looking for current information on developments in the 
use of microfacies analysis. 
Since microfacies studies are based on thin sections, 
instructive plates showing thin-section photographs ac-
companied by thorough and detailed explanations form 
a central part of this book. All plates in the book con-
tain a short summary of the topic. An-> sign leads the 
reader to the figures on the plate. The description of 
the microphotographs are printed in a smaller type. Care 
has been tak:en to add arrows and/or letters (usually the 
initials of the subject) so that the maximum informa-
tion can be extracted from the figures. 
Rather than being a revised version of 'Microfacies 
Analysis ofLimestones' (Flügel1982) 'Microfacies of 
Carbonate Rocks' is a new book, based on a new con-
cept and offering practical advice on the description 
and interpretation ofmicrofacies data as well as the ap-
plication of these data to basin analysis. Microfacies 
analysis has the advantages over traditional sedimen-
tological approaches ofbeing interdisciplinary, andin-
tegrating sedimentological, paleontological and geo-
chemical aspects. 
'Microfacies of Carbonate Rocks': 
• analyses both the depositional and the diagenetic his-
tory of carbonate rocks, 
• describes carbonate sedimentation in various ma-
rine and non-marine environments, and considers 
both tropical warm-water carbonates and non-tropi-
cal cool-water carbonates, 
• presents diagnostic features and highlights the sig-
nificance of microfacies criteria, 
• stresses the biological controls of carbonate Sedi-
mentation and provides an overview on the most 
common fossils found in thin sections of limestones, 
discusses the relationships between diagenetic pro-
cesses, porosity and dolomitization, 
• demonstrates the importance of microfacies for es-
tablishing and evaluating sequence Stratigraphie 
frameworks and depositional models, 
• underlines the potential of microfacies in differenti-
ating paleoclimate changes and tracing platform-ba-
sin relationships, and 
• demonstrates the value of microfacies analysis in 
evaluating reservoir rocks and Iimestone resources, 
as well as its usefulness in archaeological prov-
enance studies. 
Structure of the Book 
Microfacies of Carbonate Rocks starts with and in-
troductory chaper (Chap.1) and an overview of mod-
ern carbonate deposition (Chap. 2) followed by 17 chap-
ters that have been grouped into 3 major parts. 
Microfacies Analysis (Chap. 3 to Chap. 10) summa-
rizes the methods used in microfacies sturlies followed 
by discussions on descriptive modes and the implica-
tions of qualitative and quantitative thin-section crite-
ria. 
Microfacies Interpretation (Chap. 11 to Chap. 16) 
demonstrates the significance of microfacies studies 
in evaluating paleoenvironment and depositional sys-
tems and, finally, 
Practical Use ofMicrofacies (Chap. 17 to Chap. 19) 
demonstrates the importance of applied microfacies 
studies in geological exploration for hydrocarbons and 
ores, provides examples of the relationships between 
carbonate rock resources and their facies and physical 
properties, and also illustrates the value of microfacies 
studies to archaeologists. 
Important references are listed at the end of chap-
ters or sections under the heading 'Basics'. The code

numbers K ... are keywords leading to references on 
specific fields of interest (see CD), e.g. K021 (cold-
water carbonates ), K078 (micrite ), or K200 (hydrocar-
bon reservoir rocks). 
The book is also accompanied by a CD containing 
• an alphabetical list of about 14,000 references on 
carbonate rocks (see Appendix) as word document, 
and 
• visual comparison charts for percentage estimation. 
Synopsis of the Book's Contents 
Chapter 1: New Perspectives in Microfacies. Micro-
facies studies, which were originally restricted to the 
scale ofthin sections, provide an invaluable source of 
information on the depositional constraints and envi-
ronmental controls of carbonates, as well as on the prop-
erties of carbonate rocks. Microfacies studies assist in 
understanding sequence Stratigraphie pattems and are 
of economic importance both in reservoir studies and 
in the evaluation of Iimestone resources. 
Chapter 2: Modern Depositional Environments. Knowl-
edge of modern carbonates is a prerequisite for under-
standing ancient carbonate rocks. Modem carbonates 
are formed both on landandin the sea, in shallow- and 
in deep marine settings, and in tropical and non-tropi-
cal regions, but the present is only part a key to the 
Past. 
Microfacies Analysis 
Chapter 3: Methodology. Which methods can be used 
in the field? Which sampling strategy should be ap-
plied and how many samples are required? Which labo-
ratory techniques are useful in microfacies analysis? 
Which other techniques should be combined with 
microfacies studies? 
Chapter 4: Microfacies Data: Matrix and Grains. This 
chapter offers practical advice on how to handle micro-
facies data, and deals with how to describe and inter-
pret thin-section characteristics. Matrixtypes and grain 
categories are discussed with regard to their diagnostic 
criteria, origin and significance. 
Chapter 5: Microfacies Data: Fabrics. Typical deposi-
tional and diagenetic fabrics in Iimestones reflect the 
history of the rock. Microfacies criteria indicating 
breaks and changes in sedimentation ( discontinuity sur-
faces) are of specific interest in refining sequence strati-
graphic boundaries. Variously sized fissures, micro-
cracks and breccias can be used in deciphering syn-
and post-depositional destructive processes. 
Chapter 6: Quantitative Microfacies Analysis. Whilst 
previous chapters focused on qualitative criteria this 
chapter deals with quantitative data including grain size 
analysis, frequency analysis and multivariate studies. 
Constituent analysis and the distribution pattems of spe-
cific grain types are valuable tools in the reconstruc-
tion of paleoenvironmental controls and depositional 
settings. 
Chapter 7: Diagenesis, Porosity and Dolomitization. 
Understanding diagenetic processes and their products 
is ofhigh economic importance. The diagenetic micro-
facies of a rock reflects changes in the course of its 
lithification history. The main topics discussed in this 
chapter are porosity types, carbonate cements, diage-
netic textures including compaction and pressure solu-
tion, and dolomitization/dedolomitization and dolomite 
textures. The last part of the chapter deals with thin-
section criteria for metamorphic carbonates and 
marbles. 
Chapter 8: Classification - chosing a name for your 
sample. A classification is simply a tool for organizing 
information, and should not be the only source of con-
clusions. Whilst a name based on texture and compo-
sition can not replace a well-defined microfacies type, 
rock names are essential for the categorization of 
samples. Textura! classifications proposed by Dunharn 
and by Folk have proven to be the most practical. Spe-
cific concepts must be adhered to in the naming of reef 
limestones, non-marine carbonates, recrystallized car-
bonates rocks and mixed siliciclastic-carbonate rocks. 
Chapter 9: Limestones are Biological Sediments. In 
contrast to siliciclastic rocks, both the formation and 
the destruction of most Iimestones is directly or indi-
rectly influenced and controlled by biological pro-
cesses. This chapter stresses the biological controls on 
carbonate Sedimentation. Microbes, encrusting organ-
isms, and macro- and microborers can yield useful in-
formation on paleoenvironment, depositional con-
straints and carbonate production. 
Chapter 10: Fossils in Thin Sections. It ls Not That 
Difficult. The recognition of fossils in thin sections is 
not so difficult once the diagnostic criteria for the main 
groups have been understood, particularly for algae and 
foraminifera, sessile invertebrates, and organisms with 
shells. This chapter provides an overview of the most 
common fossils found in thin sections of limestones. 
The text concentrates on identification criteria, envi-
ronmental and temporal distribution, and on the sig-
nificance of the fossils. Numerous instructive plates 
are included to aid in the recognition and differentia-
tion skeletal grains in thin sections.

Microfacies Interpretation 
Chapter 11: Summarizing Microfacies Criteria: Micro-
facies Types. How can microfacies data be combined 
in sensitive and practicable microfacies types? Which 
criteria should be used, which grain types are of par-
ticular importance and, how many microfacies types 
are reliable? The creation of microfacies types is illus-
trated by means of examples. 
Chapter 12: Recognizing Paleoenvironmental Condi-
tions. Carbonate sediments are particularly sensitive 
to environmental changes. Microfacies and organisms 
are excellent paleoenvironmental proxies as they re-
flect hydrodynamic conditions, the impact of storms, 
substrate conditions, light, oxygenation, seawater tem-
perature and salinity. Significant differences between 
the compositions of skeletal grain associations for 
warm-water and cold-water carbonates provide a use-
ful tool for estimating paleoclimatic changes. How deep 
was the sea? Microfacies studies provide an answer. 
Chapter 13: Integrated Facies Analysis. Understand-
ing the formation and diagenesis of carbonate rocks 
requires the combination of microfacies with mineral-
ogical and geochemical data. The chapter deals with 
acid-insoluble residues and authigenic minerals in car-
bonate rocks, discusses the value of minor elements 
and stable isotopes in tracing the depositional and di-
agenetic history of limestones, and deals with the po-
tential of organic matter in carbonate rocks for facies 
analysis. 
Chapter 14: Depositional Models, Facies Zones and 
Standard Microfacies. Microfacies areessential for de-
fining depositional models and recognizing facies 
zones. Facies models assist in understanding deposi-
tional history. Changes in sedimentological and bio-
logical criteria across shelf-slope-basin transects form 
the basis of generalized models for carbonate platforms, 
ramps and shelves. Facies belts are reflected by their 
biotic zonation pattems and the distribution of Stan-
dard Microfacies Types (SMF Types). The latter are 
virtual categories that summarize microfacies with iden-
tical criteria. Which criteria are used in differentiating 
the SMF Types of platform and ramp carbonates? What 
are the problems involved in the SMF concept? Re-
vised and refined SMF types are a meaningful tool in 
tracing facies belts, but must be used with care. Com-
mon microfacies of carbonate ramps (Ramp Micro-
facies Types) show only partial correspondence to the 
SMF Types of rimmed platforms. 
Chapter 15: BasinAnalysis: Recognizing Depositional 
Settings. Which diagnostic criteria characterize lime-
VII 
stones of different carbonate systems? Case studies for 
non-marine and marine carbonate rocks demonstrate 
how to translate microfacies into ancient depositional 
settings. Non-marine settings can be successfully re-
constructed for perlogenie carbonates, paleokarst de-
posits and ancient speleothems, travertine deposits, and 
lacustrine carbonates, these can be characterized by spe-
cific microfacies types. Marine settings can be differ-
entiated into peritidal carbonates, platforms and ramps, 
platform-slope-basin transects, and pelagic deep-ma-
rine carbonates. Grain Composition Logs are particu-
larly effective in tracing platform-basin relations. 
Chapter 16: Recognizing Depositional Constraints and 
Processes. Selected case studies are used to demon-
strate the value of microfacies data in interpreting depo-
sitional controls. 
• How can microfacies be used in sequence stratigra-
phy? Cyclic depositional pattems and sequence Strati-
graphie constraints are documented by microfacies data 
that assist in recognizing sequence boundaries, para-
sequences, high-frequency sea-level changes, and sys-
tems tracts. 
• Which criteria characterize reef limestones? Major 
reef types differ in biota, matrix, sediment, and cements. 
Which methods should be employed in reconstructing 
former platforms and reefs that are only recorded by 
eroded relicts deposited on slopes and in basins? Clast 
analysis can solve this puzzle. 
• Which criteria define ancient cold-water carbonates? 
Ancient cool-water shelf and reef carbonates are typi-
fied by specific biotic, compositional and diagenetic 
features. 
• Which facies criteria are diagnostic of ancient vent-
and seep carbonates? Case studies provide answers. 
• How to handle mixed carbonate-siliciclastic sedi-
ments and interpret limestone-marl successions? 
• Constraints on carbonate deposition exhibit secular 
variations, which are discussed in the last section. 
Practical Use of Microfacies 
Chapter 17: Reservoir Rocks and H ost Rocks. Carbon-
ates are the most important reservoir rocks for hydro-
carbons as well as forming important host rocks for 
ores. Limestones and dolomites contain more than 50% 
of the world's oil and gas reserves. Reservoir potential 
differs for carbonates formed in different depositional 
settings and depends on the interplay of depositional 
processes and diagenetic history. The microfacies of 
cores and cuttings assist in the translation of lithological 
data into petrophysical information. Facies-based out-
crop-analogue studies indicate the scale of porosity and

permeability variations within carbonate bodies. Micro-
facies analysis also assists in the genetic interpretation 
of carbonate-hosted base metal deposits controlled by 
specific facies pattems. 
Chapter 18: Carbonate Resources, Facies Control and 
Rock Properties. Carbonate rocks are important raw 
materials for chemical and construction industries and 
arehigh on the list of extracted mineral resources, both 
in terms of quantity and of value. Both exploration and 
exploitation can be enhanced by taking into account 
the relationships between depositional and diagenetic 
facies that control technologically relevant chemical 
and physical parameters, as well as the weathering and 
decay properties of carbonate rocks. Conservation and 
preservation of works of art and building stones should 
start with thin-section studies of the textural and di-
agenetic criteria that describe the porosity and perme-
ability of the material. 
Chapter 19: Archaeometry. Microfacies analysis, com-
bined with geochemical data has considerable poten-
tial in provenance analysis of archaeological materi-
als. Thin sections reveal the source of building stones 
and of material used for mosaics and works of arts. 
The microfacies of temper grains in ancient pottery 
helps in understanding the source and production ar-
eas for ceramics. Last but not least, microfacies stud-
ies can throw new light at the love affair between 
Antony and Cleopatra ....
