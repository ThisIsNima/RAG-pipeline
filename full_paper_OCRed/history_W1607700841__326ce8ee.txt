PREFACE 
This book is intended to be a comprehensive interdisciplinary synthesis of information on 
the origin, early diagenesis, character, distribution and bulk geochemical composition of 
sedimentary organic matter. Although I cannot disguise the fact that the book has been 
written primarily for a geological audience, I have tried to approach the problem in a way 
which I hope may also appeal to the wider range of earth and environmental scientists with 
actual or potential interests in modem or ancient sedimentary organic matter. The level of the 
book is aimed at postgraduate students and at professional scientists in both academia and 
industry. 
The book is organized around the discussion of processes, mechanisms and the nature and 
distribution of particular organic components, rather than different depositional environ-
ments or specific case histories. I believe this approach is more flexible and provides a better 
overview of the underlying principles. The book could have been organized in many 
different, but arguably logical, ways; I have opted to organize it on a scientific, rather than a 
discipline basis, and thus to consider the general principles governing the distribution of 
organic matter in sediments before the specific factors relating to individual organic 
components. Chapters 2 to 6 thus deal with general aspects of the character, production, 
diagenesis and distribution of organic carbon in sediments. Chapters 7 to 11 then go on to deal 
largely with descriptive information on the biological origin and nature of various specific 
components of particulate organic matter; Chapters 12 to 19 then deal with information 
concerning the physical and ecological controls on their distribution in modem and ancient 
sediments. Following this background, the next few chapters consider the different methods 
and criteria used in classifying organic matter in sediments. Chapter 20 reviews and discusses 
the issue of optical (palynological) classification of particulate organic matter in sediments. 
Chapters 21 to 23 review the most common bulk geochemical methods for characterizing and 
classifying the organic matter in sediments, with the deliberate intention of demonstrating the 
value, if not the necessity, of integrating this data with microscopy-based information. 
Chapter 24 briefly examines the relationship between palynofacies and sequence stratigraphy. 
Chapter 25 considers some methodological and practical questions related to the palaeo-
environmental interpretation of palynofacies data. Most of the emphasis of the book is on 
marine environments, but specific aspects of lacustrine settings are also dealt with in some 
detail. 
As this book is not intended for 'beginners', I have not attempted to explain all the basic 
concepts and terms which have been assimilated from different disciplines. However, I have 
taken a comprehensive approach to referencing in the hope that readers will find this a useful 
source book to help locate the specific and background information that they may seek. As 
part of this policy, I have referenced published works down to the individual page number, 
unless the work is referred to in its entirety. As the study of sedimentary organic matter is 
such a multidisciplinary pursuit, the relevant data is scattered through the literature of many 
different fields and is currently being produced at a rate of well over 150 relevant publications

xii Preface 
every year. I hope the extensive bibliography will provide some useful short cuts for those 
wishing to read outside their own specialist areas; this book is not meant to be an alternative 
to reading the primary sources. 
I have deliberately avoided 'formal' coverage of some subject areas, mostly for the sake of 
brevity, or because of the prior existence of adequate texts or reviews. These areas include 
terrestrial Quaternary palynology, taxonomic palaeopalynology, palynological and petrolo-
gical preparation techniques, coal petrology, organic maturation, general organic geo-
chemistry and general palaeobotany. It is perhaps inevitable that the more one attempts to be 
comprehensive, the more one can be simultaneously accused of having written too much and 
of having left out or 'glossed over' other people's favourite topics! Hopefully, however, there 
is something here for everyone interested in sedimentary organic matter. 
This book was written mainly because I perceived the need for a comprehensive single-
author volume that would lay down a solid foundation of data and concepts that could then 
be built upon in subsequent studies. I also wanted to try to break down the largely artificial 
barriers that exist between the diverse group of scientists interested in sedimentary organic 
matter. Consequently, this book was not written specifically for palynologists, organic 
petrologists or organic geochemists, but for those who seek a broad understanding of 
sedimentary organic matter that is not constrained by single-discipline perspectives. I also 
hope that this work may indirectly help to promote the wider use of the palynofacies 
technique within the earth sciences, especially in combination with bulk geochemical studies.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 
I would like to thank Janet Baker and Colin Stuart (University College London) for the initial 
drafting of 140 of the diagrams, and Barbara Brown (NRG, Newcastle) for drafting the other 
50 figures and for revising some of the others. I also wish to thank Simon Tull (ex-Chapman & 
Hall) for originally commissioning this book, and Ruth Cripwell (Chapman & Hall) who took 
over the editorial task. I would particularly like to express my gratitude to my friends for their 
invaluable moral support during the four and a half trying years it took to produce this book, 
especially John and Wilma Aston and Peter and Sue Rawson. The forbearance of my 
colleagues is also appreciated.

All absolute radiometric ages (Ma or ka) reported in the text are derived from Harland et al. 
(1990). The ages cited may be more specific than the named interval; for example, a 
Campanian-Maastrichtian study may be named only as 'Late Cretaceous', whereas the age 
range given corresponds to the actual stages studied.
