Abstract
Transition metals occupy an essential niche in biological systems. Their electrostatic properties
stabilize substrates or reaction intermediates in the active sites of enzymes, while their heightened
reactivity is harnessed for catalysis. However, the latter property renders transition metals toxic at
high concentrations. Bacteria, like all living organisms, must regulate the levels of these elements
to satisfy their physiological needs while avoiding harm. It is therefore not surprising that the host
capitalizes on both the essentiality and toxicity of transition metals to defend against bacterial
invaders. This review will discuss established and emerging paradigms in nutrient metal
homeostasis at the pathogen-host interface.
Transition metals are involved in many crucial biological processes and are therefore
necessary for the survival of all living organisms. These metals are frequently incorporated
into metalloproteins including metalloenzymes, storage proteins and transcription factors.
The functional roles of transition metals in biological systems can be broken down broadly
into non-catalytic functions, redox catalysis and non-redox catalysis. Of the redox-active
metals, Fe is most commonly used, followed by Cu and Mo1. In both eukaryotes and
prokaryotes, approximately 50% of non-haem Fe and Cu proteins are oxidoreductases or
other electron transfer proteins 1. In addition, haem Fe is an important cofactor for
respiration, as well as various biosynthetic and metabolic processes. Although Mg is the
most prevalent non-redox metal found in enzymes, Zn is the most common transition
metal 1. Zn can serve structural as well as catalytic roles in proteins. Interestingly, the
distribution of Zn-binding proteins differs significantly within bacteria, archaea and
eukaryotes. Enzymes constitute approximately 80% of the zinc-containing proteins of
archaea and bacteria but less than 50% in eukaryotes, however Zn-dependent transcription
factors make up 44% of the zinc-containing proteins in eukaryotes, demonstrating that Zn
plays an important role in gene regulation in these organisms 2. Consequently, Zn-binding
proteins make up a larger proportion of the total proteome in eukaryotes as compared to
bacteria and archaea3.
All living organisms require transition metals to survive; yet the catalytic activity of these
metals also potentiates their toxicity and the levels of transition metals must therefore be
carefully controlled. Moreover, the mechanisms used to limit the availability of free
transition metals also serve as a countermeasure against invading bacteria. The human body
is a rich reservoir of essential nutrients for those bacteria that have evolved to exploit this
resource. To prevent infection with pathogenic organisms, humans, like other mammals,
restrict access to essential metals in a process termed “nutritional immunity”. Originally
coined to refer to restriction of iron availability by the host, the term “nutritional immunity”
can also be applied to mechanisms for withholding other essential transition metals or

directing the toxicity of these metals against microbial invaders. This review will focus on
four of these metals, namely Fe, Mn, Zn and Cu, and will discuss the roles for these metals
at the pathogen-host interface. In addition, emerging paradigms in nutritional immunity will
be reviewed, including host strategies for metal intoxication, the interplay between host
genetics and the outcome of bacterial infections, and the extension of nutritional immunity
to include non-metals.
Fe limitation: a universal strategy in innate defence
Fe is the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust and the most abundant transition
metal in the human body. In bacteria, Fe is a co-factor of many enzymes and as such plays a
crucial role in diverse physiological processes such as DNA replication, transcription and
central metabolism1. Furthermore, the Fe-containing protoporphyrin haem is incorporated
into cytochromes, thus participating in energy generation through respiration. Fe is required
by virtually all bacterial pathogens and vertebrates therefore limit access to Fe to exploit this
requirement as a potent defence against infection4, 5. As a result, bacteria must elaborate Fe-
acquisition systems in order to successfully colonize host tissues. Recent reviews have
focused on bacterial systems for acquiring Fe and the mechanisms utilized by vertebrate
hosts to withhold Fe from invading bacteria 6-10. These mechanisms are discussed briefly
below to allow comparison with other systems.
Host mechanisms for withholding iron
To prevent access to Fe, vertebrates use a number of proteins that render this valuable
nutrient largely inaccessible to bacteria that lack sophisticated Fe-capturing systems (Figure
1a). In vertebrates, the majority of Fe is complexed to haem, a tetrapyrrole ring encircling a
singular Fe atom and the cofactor of the oxygen transport protein haemoglobin.
Haemoglobin is further contained within circulating erythrocytes, representing an additional
barrier to access by pathogens. If free haemoglobin or haem is released from erythrocytes,
these molecules are rapidly bound by haptoglobin and haemopexin, respectively. Therefore,
for bacterial pathogens to access this rich pool of Fe, they must lyse erythrocytes, remove
haem from haemoglobin or haemopexin, then liberate the Fe from the macrocyclic
conjunction of haem.
In addition to haem, Fe is stored intracellularly in the Fe storage protein ferritin and is
therefore only accessible to intracellular pathogens following host cell lysis. Moreover,
natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1 (NRAMP1) localizes to the phagosomal
membrane where it pumps Fe and Mn out of the phagosomal compartment, further reducing
access to these metals by intracellular pathogens that reside within a phagosome 11. At
physiological pH, extracellular Fe2+ is oxidized to the insoluble Fe3+ and mobilized by the
serum protein transferrin, which binds Fe3+ with exceptionally high affinity. Free Fe3+ is
also bound by lactoferrin, a globular glycoprotein of the transferrin family that is present in
secretions such as breast milk, tears, and saliva. Notably, lactoferrin is present within the
granules of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and is therefore a crucial component of the
mucosal innate response to infection 12.
Bacterial iron acquisition
All bacterial pathogens must have mechanisms to circumvent nutritional immunity. In the
case of Fe, these strategies are numerous and varied. Perhaps the most elegant strategy to
circumvent host-mediated Fe sequestration is that of Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative
agent of Lyme disease: by substituting Mn in place of Fe within its Fe-requiring enzymes,
this organism does not require Fe to infect its host 13. However, as discussed in subsequent
sections, the host encodes additional mechanisms to restrict Mn availability.

Strategies for Fe acquisition can be generally divided into siderophore, haem and free Fe2+
acquisition systems (Figure 1b). Siderophores are low molecular weight Fe chelators that are
secreted by bacteria and bind Fe3+ with an affinity that surpasses that of transferrin and
lactoferrin (1023 M−1) 14. As these molecules are too large to diffuse through non-selective
porins in the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria, energy-dependent transport of
siderophores is mediated through TonB-dependent receptors. The periplasm of Gram-
negative bacteria lacks ATP or ionic gradients that can drive transport across the outer
membrane. Therefore, energy from the proton motive force generated at the inner membrane
is harnessed by the TonB-ExbB-ExbD system to mediate outer membrane transport. In the
periplasm, substrate binding proteins (SBPs), members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
transporter family, recognize the siderophore-Fe complex and ultimately shuttle this
complex to the cognate transporter. Gram-positive bacteria also express SBPs, however
these proteins are tethered to the cytoplasmic membrane. In both Gram-positive and Gram-
negative bacteria, once siderophores are in the cytoplasm, the Fe3+ is released through
reduction to Fe2+ or through enzymatic degradation of the siderophore. The end result is the
release of Fe2+ for use as a nutrient source. To combat siderophore-mediated Fe3+
acquisition, vertebrates produce neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL; also
known as lipocalin 2 or siderocalin), which binds and sequesters certain siderophores (Fig.
1a) 15. However, some bacteria produce ‘stealth’ siderophores that evade siderocalin by
chemical modification 16, 17.
Haem acquisition systems typically involve a cell surface receptor for either haem or
haemoproteins, which pass haem through a membrane transport system into the cytoplasm.
There are several well-characterized systems in Gram-negative bacteria 10, 18, 19. In Gram-
positive bacteria, the major systems described to date include the Fe-regulated surface
determinant (Isd) system found in many Firmicutes as well as the Shr, Shp and HtsABC
proteins found in the streptococci 6-8, 20. The first step in haem transport involves binding of
haem, haemoglobin, or haemoglobin-haptoglobin complexes by cell wall-anchored receptors
(Gram-positive) or TonB-dependent receptors (Gram-negative). Haem is then extracted
from haemoglobin and relayed to a SBP associated with a haem-specific ABC family
transporter that mediates translocation into the cytoplasm. In addition to surface-bound
receptors, some bacteria produce secreted proteins that complex haem, which are known as
hemophores and are functionally analogous to siderophores 21, 22. Once bound to haem,
haemophores are recognized by haemophore receptors and the haem is internalized.
Upon translocation into the bacterial cytoplasm haem is degraded by haem catabolizing
enzymes (Figure 1b). These haem oxygenases can be classified into three different enzyme
families. The HO-1 family is evolutionary related to the eukaryotic haem degrading
enzymes 23. HO-1 family members are present in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive
bacteria and degrade haem to free Fe2+ and biliverdin 23. The IsdG-family haem oxygenases
are found in both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, and these enzymes degrade
haem to Fe2+ and staphylobilin, a chromophore24-27. More recently, a third family of haem
oxygenases represented by the Campylobacteri jejuni ChuZ enzyme has been
described 28, 29; the product of ChuZ-mediated haem degradation is not yet known.
Although Fe is predominantly transported in the chelated form, some bacteria also transport
free Fe. In some cases, bacteria express receptors for host Fe-binding proteins such as the
transferrin receptors found in Neisseria spp., Morexella catarrhalis and Haemophilus
influenzae 30. These TonB-dependent receptors bind transferrin, then extract and transport
Fe3+ across the outer membrane. Additionally, some bacteria transport free Fe2+ across the
cytoplasmic membrane using the FeoB family of transporters 31-34 (Fig 1b). FeoB is a large
membrane protein containing a GTP-binding domain that is similar to eukaryotic G
proteins 32. GTPase activity is necessary for Fe2+ transport, and coupling of the G protein

and membrane transporter domains within the same protein distinguishes FeoB from
eukaryotic G-protein coupled receptors 32. FeoB is typically co-expressed with FeoA, a
small SH3-domain protein that is probably found in the cytoplasm, and FeoC, which is
thought to act as a Fe-S-dependent repressor 32. Overall, FeoB represents a unique family of
bacterial transition metal transporters, members of which are important for virulence in
numerous pathogens 31-34.
Nutritional immunity is not a defensive strategy that is exclusive to vertebrates. Mechanisms
for Fe restriction exist in plants and invertebrates including the expression of ferritins and
transferrins 35-37. In the entomopathogen, Photorhabdus luminescens, Fe availability is an
important signal for the switch between symbiotic colonization and pathogenic infection. In
these bacteria, certain iron acquisition systems are crucial for virulence but dispensable for
symbiosis 38. Similarly, iron acquisition through siderophores serves as a virulence strategy
for phytopathogens, while siderophores produced by symbiotic bacteria in the rhizosphere
can be beneficial to plants (Box 1). Clearly, iron acquisition is important for both bacterial
pathogenesis and symbiosis. Moreover, withholding of iron is a conserved innate immune
strategy across multiple kingdoms of life.
Mn and Zn in pathogen-host interactions
Nutritional immunity is not limited to strategies for withholding Fe 39. Mn and Zn also play
vital roles in bacteria 40. Mn serves a catalytic role in many proteins and is important in
oxidative stress resistance 41-44. In some bacteria, Mn2+ can replace the more reactive Fe2+
in Fe-containing proteins, reducing oxidative damage to these proteins 44. Furthermore, Mn-
dependent superoxide dismutases are encoded by many pathogens, indicating that these
organisms require Mn to defend against superoxide 45. Zn is the second most abundant
transition metal in most living systems and can serve both catalytic and structural roles
within proteins 46. In fact, it is estimated that Zn-binding proteins represent approximately
4-8 % of all proteins encoded in the genomes of prokaryotes 3. Given these crucial roles for
Mn and Zn in bacterial physiology, it is not surprising that sequestration of these nutrient
metals is an important innate defense strategy.
Chelating Mn2+ and Zn2+ at mucosal and epithelial surfaces
The S100 family of proteins is a large family of calcium binding proteins found in
vertebrates, several of which have been implicated in defense against infection (Figure 2a).
S100A7, also known as psoriasin, is secreted by keratinocytes and inhibits microbial growth
through the chelation of nutrient Zn2+ 47. S100A12, also known as calgranulin C, binds both
Zn2+ and Cu2+ in vitro and Cu-S100A12 is involved in the generation of superoxide
species 48, 49. It is not yet known whether the antimicrobial properties of this protein result
from the generation of superoxide or through nutrient metal sequestration. S100A8 and
S100A9 function as a heterodimer known as calprotectin (also referred to as MRP 8/14 and
calgranulin A/B). Calprotectin makes up approximately 40% of the protein composition of
the neutrophil cytoplasm and is highly antimicrobial against a variety of bacterial and fungal
pathogens 50-52. The antibacterial activity of calprotectin results from chelation of nutrient
Mn2+ and Zn2+ (Box 2) 50. This chelation is mediated through two high-affinity binding
sites both of which can bind Zn2+ with nanomolar affinity while only one binds Mn2+ with
such affinity 45. Since the initial report defining a role for calprotectin in protection against
Staphylococcus aureus infection, this protein has also been implicated in defence against
infection by Salmonella Typhimurium and the fungal pathogens Aspergillus spp. and
Candida spp. 51-54. However, as discussed below, some pathogens have evolved elegant
mechanisms to counteract or exploit its antimicrobial properties.

In addition to their metal chelating properties, psoriacin, calprotectin and calgranulin C have
proinflammatory properties and serve as markers for many inflammation-mediated
pathologies 55. Given the multiple roles for these proteins in nutrient metal chelation and
inflammation, it remains to be determined whether the inflammatory properties of these
proteins are impacted by metal binding.
Bacterial Mn and Zn acquisition systems
The importance of Mn and Zn acquisition to bacterial pathogenesis has been demonstrated
in many organisms including S. Typhimurium, C. jejuni, Yersinia spp., Brucella abortus, H.
influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae 56-66. The mechanisms
of Mn2+ and Zn2+ transport across the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria are not
completely defined. Although previously believed to diffuse through non-selective porins,
designated transporters have recently been described suggesting that in some bacteria the
outer membrane provides a selective barrier to these essential nutrients (Figure 2b). One
such example is MnoP of Bradyrhizobium japonicum, which is a Mn2+-selective channel
that facilitates transport of free Mn2+ across the outer membrane 67.
Although transport of Mn2+ through MnoP is thought to be passive, transport of Zn2+ across
the outer membrane may be an energy-dependent process powered by the TonB-ExbB-
ExbD system. A Zn-regulated TonB-dependent receptor designated ZnuD has been
described in Neisseria meningitidis and orthologues of this receptor are encoded in the
genomes of several other pathogens 68. ZnuD shares sequence similarity with the haem
transporter HumA from Morexalla catarrhalis and facilitates haem acquisition when
expressed in Escherichia coli 69. These findings, together with the dual regulation of ZnuD
by Zur (Zn uptake regulator) and Fur (Fe uptake regulator), suggest that ZnuD may
participate in both Zn2+ and haem acquisition 69. Alternatively, cross-regulation of ZnuD
may stem from an increased need for exogenous haem under Zn-limiting conditions, as
some endogenous haem biosynthetic enzymes require Zn 70.
It is not yet known whether Zn2+ is transported across the outer membrane as a free ion or as
a Zn2+-chelate as is seen for Fe3+. The finding that ZnuD facilitates haem uptake suggests
that Zn2+ may be translocated in a chelated form by this transporter. Moreover, transport of
a Zn2+-chelate, rather than free Zn2+, might explain why Zn2+ transport is an energy-
dependent process, unlike transport of free Mn2+ ions by the energy-independent MnoP
channel. Zn2+-chelating compounds analogous to siderophores have not been identified in
pathogenic bacteria. However, a putative tsinkosphore (“tsinkos” is greek for Zn)
biosynthetic operon, the coelibactin gene cluster, has been identified in the antibiotic-
producing bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor. In S. coelicolor this gene cluster is regulated
by Zur in a Zn-dependent manner, supporting a role for this cluster and its putative product
in the transport of Zn2+ 71. Moreover, pyochelin from Pseudomonas aeruginosa binds Zn2+
and Cu with high affinity in vitro, although transport of Zn2+-pyochelin has not been
demonstrated in vivo 72. Nonetheless, the possibility remains that pathogenic bacteria secrete
small molecule Zn2+ chelators as a strategy to acquire this nutrient during infection.
The import of Mn2+ and Zn2+ across the cytoplasmic membrane of both Gram-positive and
Gram-negative bacteria is primarily facilitated by either ABC-family transporters or
NRAMP family transporters 39, 73. These include high-affinity uptake systems such as
ZnuABC, AdcBCA and MntABC as well as the NRAMP-family Mn2+ transporter
MntH 41, 57, 58, 61, 62, 74, 75. Some FeoB orthologues may also transport Mn2+ 76.
Translocation of Mn2+ and Zn2+ across the cytoplasmic membrane by ABC family
transporters is analogous to that described above for siderophores and haem. Examples of
Mn2+ and Zn2+ acquisition systems are depicted in Figure 2b and listed in Table 1.

Several Mn2+ and Zn2+ transporters have demonstrated roles in pathogenesis, but a direct
role in evading nutrient chelation by calprotectin or other host proteins has generally not
been demonstrated. One exception is the recent evidence that S. Typhimurium expressing
the ZnuABC zinc uptake system is resistant to calprotectin-mediated Zn2+ chelation 53. This
system allows extracellular S. Typhimurium to resist the high levels of calprotectin that
accumulate in the intestine following infection. Moreover, S. Typhimurium exploits
calprotectin-mediated Zn-chelation in order to outcompete the host microbiota, which is less
well adapted to the resulting nutrient-deficient environment 53.
Exploiting Mn and Zn toxicity to kill invading bacteria
In addition to mechanisms for withholding nutrient metals from invading bacteria, there is
growing evidence to suggest that in mammals nutritional immunity harnesses the toxic
properties of transition metals to kill bacteria 77. It was recently determined that following
engulfment of either Mycobacterium tuberculosis or E. coli, macrophages release Zn from
intracellular stores which then accumulates in the phagolysosome 78. Survival within the
phagolysosome depends on the expression of a Zn2+ efflux system in M. tuberculosis,
supporting the idea that bacteria encounter Zn toxicity in vivo and that the ability to resist
this toxicity is important for pathogenesis 78. Given that Zn2+ uptake systems are required
for the pathogenesis of other intracellular pathogens such as S. enterica, the relative
contributions of Zn intoxication and Zn limitation by the host remain to be fully elucidated.
The balance between these mechanisms is probably affected by the tissue and cell type,
intracellular trafficking of the pathogen and the time point in the infectious cycle, as well as
by the pathogen itself and its unique physiological requirements.
Bacterial Mn and Zn detoxification is primarily mediated by P-type ATPases (Figure 2c).
These ATP-driven pumps have narrow substrate specificity, which is dictated by a
membrane-embedded metal recognition site 79. Zn2+ can also be exported via RND-family
transporters that span the inner membrane, periplasm and outer membrane of Gram-negative
bacteria. In this case, energy from the proton motive force drives efflux from the cytoplasm
or periplasm to the cell exterior. The requirement for Mn and Zn efflux systems in the
pathogenesis of several bacteria suggests that bacteria encounter Mn and Zn toxicity in
vivo 78, 80, 81. However, the mechanisms by which Mn and Zn cause toxicity are not fully
known. Emerging data suggest that maintaining a defined ratio of transition metals is
important for bacterial physiology 82, 83. For example, PsaA of S. pneumoniae, a
pneumococcal surface protein, binds both Mn2+ and Zn2+ but only transports Mn2+84, 85.
Increasing the extracellular ratio of Zn2+: Mn2+ leads to high-affinity binding of Zn2+ to
PsaA, blocking Mn2+ uptake and thus potentiating the effects of Mn2+ depletion 83.
Additionally, expression of czcD, which encodes a Zn efflux transporter, is up-regulated
under Mn-limiting conditions, suggesting that Zn toxicity may be enhanced under Mn-
deficient conditions 86.
Cu: new insights into an ancient antibacterial agent
Humans have recognized the antibacterial effects of Cu for millennia and have exploited this
property for industrial and medical purposes 87. Despite the long history of Cu use as an
antimicrobial, we have only recently begun to appreciate that Cu has a role in innate
defence. The accumulation of Cu at sites of infection was first demonstrated in M.
tuberculosis pulmonary infections where it was found that Cu resistance is necessary for M.
tuberculosis virulence 88. In the mammalian host, bacteria encounter Cu within the
phagolysosomes of macrophages. Interferon gamma induces expression of the Cu
transporter Ctr1, which actively takes up Cu from the extracellular environment 89. Atox1
then shuttles Cu to ATP7A, a Cu transporter on the phagolysosomal membrane, facilitating
Cu accumulation within this compartment 89-91 (Figure 3a).

The mechanisms of Cu toxicity are not completely understood; however, accumulating
evidence suggests it may be multifactorial involving both oxidative damage and disruption
of Fe-S clusters. Like Fe, Cu can undergo Fenton chemistry in vitro, reacting with hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2) to produce hydroxyl radicals, which in turn damage lipids, proteins and
DNA (Figure 3a). Cu enhances the bactericidal capacity of macrophages in vitro, an effect
which is further magnified by the addition of H2O2 and reversed by the addition of an
antioxidant 89. It should be noted that the ability of Cu to mediate the Fenton reaction in vivo
has been debated. Cu does not induce oxidative damage in E. coli, leaving open the
possibility that oxidative damage observed in other organisms upon Cu exposure is the result
of secondary mechanisms rather than a direct effect of Cu 92. Alternative mechanisms for
Cu toxicity have been described. For example, recent characterization of a copA mutant of
Neisseria gonorrhoeae revealed a role for Cu in potentiating nitrosative stress 93. CopA is a
Cu+ exporter and CopA homologues are found in several other bacterial species. Loss of this
protein in N. gonorrhoeae leads to increased sensitivity to Cu and nitrosative stress. Cervical
epithelial cells produce nitric oxide (NO) in response to gonococcal infection 94; however, it
is not yet known whether gonococci are exposed to extracellular Cu at this site of infection
or whether Cu intoxication occurs following engulfment by immune cells. Finally, Cu+ also
targets Fe-S clusters in dehydratases involved in processes such as branched-chain amino
acid synthesis. A similar mechanism has also been demonstrated for metals such as Cd2+,
Hg2+, Ag+ and Zn2+ 95. The resulting disruption of crucial metabolic processes can be
reversed by addition of pathway end products in some bacteria 96, 97. Notably, this strategy
does not reverse the toxicity associated with Hg2+ and Ag+, nor does it reverse Cu toxicity
in an S. Typhimurium mutant lacking CueO, a Cu1+ oxidase 95, 96. As the addition of
pathway end products does not reverse Cu toxicity in all bacteria, it is likely that there are
multiple mechanisms of Cu toxicity 96. It is likely that the precise intracellular target for Cu
depends on the bacterium and the physiological conditions in which Cu is encountered.
Cu acquisition and detoxification in bacteria
The mechanisms of Cu acquisition in bacteria are largely unknown. Methane-oxidizing
bacteria (methanotrophs) utilize Cu in methane monooxygenases (MMOs) and Cu
accumulation regulates the switch from soluble, Cu-independent sMMO to the membrane-
bound, Cu-dependent pMMO form 98-100. Methanotrophs produce Cu-chelating compounds
known as chalkophores (“chalko” is Greek for copper) or methanobactins (Mbs) 100-102.
Mbs produced by Methylosinus trichosporium str. OB3b bind Cu+ with affinities in the
range of 1019 – 1020 M-1 depending on pH 103, 104. The internalization of Mbs depends on
the TonB/ExbB/ExbD system and is thus proposed to be analogous to siderophore
uptake105. It remains to be determined whether pathogenic bacteria express compounds
similar to methanobactin to acquire Cu. In addition to methanobactin-mediated transport, Cu
can also be taken up by the cell through energy-independent channels, although the identity
and selectivity of such channels is not currently known 105.
In contrast to the dearth of information regarding mechanisms of Cu uptake, the mechanisms
of Cu detoxification have been characterized in multiple pathogenic bacteria and these
systems are often necessary for pathogenesis 88, 96, 106-108. Bacteria possess several lines of
defence against Cu toxicity, beginning with their relatively low physiological need for Cu
and the physical localization of Cu-dependent proteins outside the cytoplasm. In addition,
bacteria possess multiple mechanisms to detoxify the cytoplasm and periplasm in the
presence of excess Cu. In general, this involves expression of cytoplasmic Cu chaperones,
Cu exporters and periplasmic multicopper oxidases87. Mycobacterial Cu resistance involves
expression of the cytoplasmic Cu chaperone, MymT, the Cu+ transporter, CtpV, and a
mycomembrane transporter, MctB88, 108-110 (Figure 4b). Both CtpV and MctB are necessary
for full virulence of M. tuberculosis 88, 108. In Gram-negative bacteria, Cu resistance is

likewise mediated by the expression of Cu+ exporters. S. Typhimurium expresses two
independently regulated P-type ATPases, CopA and GolT. Expression of copA is induced by
the transcriptional regulator CueR/SctR in the presence of Cu+ together with genes encoding
a putative periplasmic Cu+ chaperone, CueP, and the multicopper oxidase CuiD/
CueO96, 111, 112. CuiD/CueO oxidizes Cu+ to Cu2+ in the periplasm and homologues of this
protein are necessary for Cu resistance in several bacterial species 96, 111, 113. In addition to
CopA, E. coli also expresses an RND-family Cu+ exporter known as CusABC. CopA and
CusABC are independently regulated, and expression of these two systems provides a
graded response to different levels of Cu toxicity 113.
Cu detoxification strategies in Gram-positive bacteria are mostly analogous to those of
Gram-negative bacteria. In some cases, a second P-type ATPase, CopB, as well as a putative
cytoplasmic Cu chaperone, CopZ, are coexpressed with CopA 114. The multitude of Cu
detoxification systems expressed by pathogenic bacteria highlights the importance of Cu
intoxication as a host defence strategy and the applicability of Cu as an antimicrobial agent.
Evolutionary perspectives on nutritional immunity
The direct impact of nutritional immunity on human infectious diseases becomes clear when
considering patients with inherited defects in transition metal homeostasis. To date, this is
primarily restricted to defects in Fe homeostasis, although inherited disorders in Cu
(Wilson's disease) and Zn (hyperzincemia and hypercalprotectinemia) homeostasis have also
been described. Moreover, polymorphisms in the gene encoding NRAMP1, which may
disrupt intracellular trafficking of both Mn and Fe, have been associated with increased
susceptibility to intracellular pathogens such as Salmonella and Mycobacterium spp. 115-117
Hypercalprotectinemia, which is thought to be an inherited condition, is associated with
autoimmunity but it remains to be determined whether these patients experience alterations
in their ability to fight infections 118, 119. By contrast, it is well established that patients with
Fe overload conditions are often susceptible to numerous infectious diseases. For example,
frequent transfusions in patients with thalassemias and other chronic anaemias lead to excess
Fe that predisposes these patients to infections 120, 121. Patients with inherited or acquired
forms of the Fe storage disorder, haemochromatosis, are particularly susceptible to
infections with enteric Gram-negative pathogens such as Vibrio vulnificus and Yersinia
enterocolitica 122, 123. Interestingly, macrophages from patients with the inherited form of
haemochromatosis resulting from the C282Y mutation in the gene HFE are very low in Fe.
This observation led to the hypothesis that these patients are resistant to infection by
intracellular pathogens such as Salmonella typhi, the causative agent of typhoid fever, and
M. tuberculosis, the replication of which depends on intracellular Fe pools. If this is the
case, resistance to some pathogens may provide evolutionary pressure to maintain this allele
within the population 124.
The existence of bacterial receptors that specifically recognize Fe or haem-binding proteins
of their preferred or obligate hosts exemplifies the central role for nutritional immunity in
the host-pathogen relationship. For example, Staphylococcus aureus IsdB preferentially
binds human haemoglobin over haemoglobin from other species, demonstrating that S.
aureus has evolved to recognize haemoglobin from its primary host with greater
affinity 125, 126. This interaction plays an important role in pathogenesis as S. aureus
preferentially utilizes human haemoglobin as an Fe source and transgenic mice expressing
human haemoglobin are more susceptible to S. aureus infection in an IsdB-dependent
manner 125. The structural basis for IsdB binding to human haemoglobin has not been
determined. However, the co-crystal structure of IsdH NEAT domain 1 with human
haemoglobin demonstrates interactions with several residues that differ between human and
mouse haemoglobin and thus may mediate preferential recognition of the human protein 127.

A preference for a particular host Fe source is not unique to S. aureus as other bacterial
pathogens that preferentially colonize humans also grow better on human haemoglobin
compared to haemoglobin from other species 125. In addition, the obligate human pathogens
N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae express the transferrin binding receptors TbpA and
TbpB, which preferentially recognize human transferrin 128, 129. This species specificity
appears to be dictated by interactions between either TbpA or TbpB with residues on
transferrin that are unique to the human protein 130, 131. Both the examples of IsdB from S.
aureus and TbpA from Neisseria spp. introduce the intriguing possibility that
polymorphisms in human haemoglobin or transferrin may impact susceptibility or resistance
to infection.
Conclusions and areas for further research
Advances in our understanding of nutritional immunity and the requirements of pathogens
for transition metal homeostasis have led to numerous clinical and industrial applications.
Cu has been used to prevent bacterial overgrowth on industrial surfaces and has been
introduced into numerous medical devices to reduce the risk of bacterial infections 132-134.
In addition, siderophores have been used therapeutically in patients with Fe overload
disorders, and chalkophores show promise in treating Wilson's disease, an inherited copper
storage disorder 135, 136.
It is clear that nutrient limitation by the host and nutrient acquisition by bacteria are crucial
processes in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases. Likewise, transition metal intoxication
has emerged as an important component of host defence while bacterial detoxification
systems are necessary for pathogenesis. To date, much of the work in nutritional immunity
has focused on transition metals. However, bacterial pathogens also rely on their hosts for
additional nutrients such as carbon, nitrogen and sulphur. Emerging evidence suggests that
successful adaptation to the host environment depends on the ability to take advantage of the
available or predominant carbon sources 137-141. This is particularly true of intracellular
pathogens which must utilize the nutrient pool in the host cell cytoplasm 142, 143. Unlike
nutrient metal restriction by the host, it remains to be determined whether specific
mechanisms to limit non-metal nutrients are components of nutritional immunity.
As the field of nutritional immunity progresses many important questions remain open.
Bacterial transition metal acquisition systems have been extensively characterized for their
roles in virulence. Despite this, the precise mechanisms through which nutrient metal
starvation impact bacterial processes has not been clearly defined (Box 2). Bacterial
genomes encode a multitude of predicted metal-dependent enzymes, however many of their
functions and metal co-factor requirements have not been experimentally validated.
Moreover, whether additional host proteins contribute to nutrient limitation, and the
contribution of metalloproteins to processes such as immune cell recruitment, trafficking
and activation, remain to be determined. The balance between the apparently contradictory
strategies of nutrient metal limitation and metal intoxication by the host also remains to be
fully elucidated. A more complete understanding of when, where and how these strategies
are deployed will resolve this apparent paradox. Metals have a tremendous impact on the
outcome of all host-microbe interactions. Therefore, defining the mechanisms and molecular
machinery involved in the struggle for nutrient metal has the potential to uncover new
therapeutic targets for the treatment of both plant and animal infections.

Roles for Fe in plant-microorganism interactions
Plants use several strategies to restrict Fe including ferritins and transferrins. In addition,
plants express at least four different members of the NRAMP family of Mn and Fe
transporters. The role for NRAMP transporters in immunity was first appreciated in
vertebrates, where phagosomal NRAMP1 reduces Fe and Mn availability to pathogens
within this compartment 11. In Arabidopsis thaliana, AtNRAMP3 and AtNRAMP4 are
up-regulated in the plant vacuole in response to Erwinia chrysamthemii infection and are
important for Fe transport and host defence 146. It is not clear, however, whether Fe
withholding from the bacterium is the primary mechanism of AtNRAMP3/4-mediated
plant defences. AtNRAMP3/4 contribute to H2O2 accumulation in infected leaves
suggesting that extrusion of Fe from the vacuole to the cytoplasm may be important for
generating the oxidative burst 146. The role for nutritional immunity in plant defences is
also evidenced by the fact that Fe acquisition systems are required for virulence in a
number of phytopathogens 34, 36. Siderophore biosynthesis and uptake systems are the
most common mechanisms used by phytopathogens to acquire nutrient Fe from their
hosts 35. Beyond facilitating Fe uptake by pathogenic bacteria, siderophores have been
shown to exert effects on Fe distribution and overall physiology within the plant
host146, 147. These effects include induction of the salicylic acid signalling pathway in
leaves and an Fe deficiency response in roots 146, 147. Interestingly, symbiotic bacteria
within the rhizosphere also produce siderophores 148. These bacteria promote plant
growth and their siderophores are thought to benefit the plants by defending against
pathogenic fungal species as well as by enhancing Fe acquisition in roots 35, 148, 149. In
addition to siderophores, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, which causes bacterial blight
in rice, expresses FeoB and this Fe acquisition system is necessary for pathogenesis 34.
Clearly, Fe availability is a crucial component of both pathogenic and symbiotic
relationships between plants and bacteria.

Inhibition of bacterial processes through Mn2+ chelation by calprotectin
Transition metal acquisition is crucial for pathogenesis yet the diverse roles for these
metals in bacterial physiology are incompletely defined. The impact of limiting metals on
bacterial processes is an area for active investigation. One recent example is the
demonstration that Mn2+ chelation by calprotectin inhibits bacterial superoxide
defences 45. Staphylococcus aureus encodes two Mn-dependent superoxide dismutases
(SODs). Treatment with calprotectin sensitizes S. aureus to superoxide generating
compounds by limiting Mn2+ availability and thus reducing SOD activity. Furthermore,
S. aureus is more sensitive to neutrophil killing following exposure to calprotectin. These
findings lead to a model in which neutrophils deliver a double hit to S. aureus by
delivering calprotectin to the site of infection (i) where calprotectin chelates available
Mn2+ and Zn2+ (ii). Mn2+ chelation by calprotectin reduces SOD activity (iii), thereby
sensitizing S. aureus to ROS generated by the neutrophil (iv) (see Box Figure). Given
the important role for Mn in resistance to oxidative stress in other bacteria, as well as the
possibility that Zn2+ chelation by calprotectin could inhibit Cu/Zn-SODs, this model may
be generally applicable to numerous pathogens 86.

•
Microbial pathogens require nutrient metals in order to grow and cause disease.
However, excess metals are toxic therefore metal levels must be tightly
regulated during infection. Vertebrates have evolved to exploit these facts
through strategies that either prevent access to nutrient metal or direct excess
metal at invading pathogens. Collectively, these processes are known as
nutritional immunity.
•
The struggle for nutrient metal between both host and pathogen is most well
studied in the area of iron. In this case, iron is sequestered from invading
pathogens intracellularly or in high-affinity iron binding proteins. To combat
host-mediated iron sequestration, microbial pathogens elaborate a number of
high-affinity iron acquisition systems.
•
Recently, vertebrate proteins of the innate immune system have been identified
that prevent microbial infection through the chelation of nutrient manganese and
zinc. These proteins are members of the S100 family of calcium binding
proteins and are abundant at sites of inflammation. In addition to manganese and
zinc sequestration, vertebrates can employ strategies to direct toxic levels of
manganese and zinc at microbial pathogens. Bacterial measures to combat
manganese and zinc sequestration as well as toxicity associated with excess
manganese and zinc are beginning to be uncovered.
•
It is becoming increasingly evident that host-mediated direction of excess
copper at microbial pathogens is a critical aspect of vertebrate defense against
infection. This observation has provided an explanation for the broad
conservation of copper detoxification systems across disease causing microbes.
•
The importance of nutritional immunity to defense against infection is
highlighted by the observation that inherited defects in transition metal
homeostasis dramatically impacts susceptibility to certain infectious diseases.
This fact underscores the tremendous therapeutic potential of targeting bacterial
metal acquisition systems.

Figure 1. Fe limitation and Fe acquisition during bacterial infections
a. Overview of Fe limitation strategies in the vertebrate host. Fe3+ is stored intracellularly in
complex with ferritin (F), bound by serum transferrin (TF) or bound by lactoferrin (LTF) at
mucosal surfaces. In the blood, Fe2+ is complexed with haem, which is bound by
haemoglobin within red blood cells (RBCs). Upon red cell lysis, haemoglobin is bound by
haptoglobin (Hpt) and free haem is scavenged by haemopexin (Hpx). In addition to these
haem-binding proteins, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) binds and
sequesters bacterial siderophores. b. Representative Fe acquisition systems expressed by
Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. Both Gram-negative and Gram-positive
pathogens possess systems to acquire Fe3+-siderophores, Fe2+-haem, Fe3+ from transferrin
and/or free Fe2+. Not all systems are expressed by the same organism. TF, transferrin; SIP,

Figure 2. Mn and Zn homeostasis at the pathogen-host interface
a. Zn2+ and Mn2+ sequestration by S100 family proteins at epithelial surfaces and within
tissue abscesses. S100A7 is released at epithelial surfaces, where it inhibits bacterial
invasion through chelation of Zn2+. In deep tissues, infection leads to recruitment of
neutrophils, which deliver calprotectin (S100A8/A9) to the infection site. Calprotectin
inhibits bacterial growth through chelation of Mn2+ and Zn2+ and is thought to be
transported away from the abscess by an as-yet-unknown mechanism. Engulfment of
bacteria by macrophages leads to decreased Zn2+ uptake and increased Zn2+ efflux from the
cytoplasm and efflux of Mn2+ and Fe from the phagosome by NRAMP1. b. Representative
Mn2+ and Zn2+ uptake systems expressed by pathogenic bacteria. c. Proposed mechanisms
of Zn2+ intoxication employed by the host and Zn2+ detoxification systems expressed by
pathogens. Upon infection, Zn accumulates in the phagolysosome where it is toxic to
bacteria. Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria primarily alleviate Zn toxicity through
efflux of excess Zn from the cytoplasm. d. Proposed mechanism for Zn toxicity in bacteria.
When the extracellular Zn2+: Mn2+ ratio is high, Zn2+ binds the SBP of Mn2+-specific
transporters, preventing Mn2+ binding and uptake.

Figure 3. New insights into the roles for Cu in innate immunity
a. Mechanisms of Cu intoxication within macrophages. Following phagocytosis of bacteria,
interferon gamma induces expression of the Cu+ importer Ctr1. Cu is bound by Atox1 and
shuttled to the phagosomal Cu+ transporter, ATP7A. Accumulation of copper within the
phagolysosome contributes to bacterial killing through multiple mechanisms including
disruption of Fe-S cluster-containing bacterial proteins and possibly through the generation
of reactive oxygen species. This leads to inhibition of bacterial metabolic processes and
damage to DNA, proteins and lipids. b. Cu detoxification systems expressed by pathogenic
bacteria. Bacteria encode multiple mechanisms to detoxify the cytoplasm or periplasm from
excess Cu+ including expression of Cu+ efflux systems, periplasmic multicopper oxidases
and cytoplasmic Cu chaperones. Many bacteria express several independently regulated Cu
detoxification systems, which provide a graded response to Cu toxicity.

Cu+ efflux systems (such as the RND family transporter CusABC), periplasmic multicopper
oxidases (such as blue Cu oxidase (CueO)) and cytoplasmic Cu+ chaperones (such as
metallothionein (MymT)). Many bacteria express several independently regulated Cu+
detoxification systems, providing a graded response to Cu+ toxicity. CM, cytoplasmic
membrane; IM, inner membrane; OM, outer membrane; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.
