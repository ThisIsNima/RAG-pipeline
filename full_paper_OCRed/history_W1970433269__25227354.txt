Abstract
Within the past few decades, there has been a surge of interest in the investigation of mindfulness
as a psychological construct and as a form of clinical intervention. This article reviews the
empirical literature on the effects of mindfulness on psychological health. We begin with a
discussion of the construct of mindfulness, differences between Buddhist and Western
psychological conceptualizations of mindfulness, and how mindfulness has been integrated into
Western medicine and psychology, before reviewing three areas of empirical research: cross-
sectional, correlational research on the associations between mindfulness and various indicators of
psychological health; intervention research on the effects of mindfulness-oriented interventions on
psychological health; and laboratory-based, experimental research on the immediate effects of
mindfulness inductions on emotional and behavioral functioning. We conclude that mindfulness
brings about various positive psychological effects, including increased subjective well-being,
reduced psychological symptoms and emotional reactivity, and improved behavioral regulation.
The review ends with a discussion on mechanisms of change of mindfulness interventions and
suggested directions for future research.

Mindfulness is the miracle by which we master and restore ourselves. Consider, for
example: a magician who cuts his body into many parts and places each part in a
different region—hands in the south, arms in the east, legs in the north, and then by
some miraculous power lets forth a cry which reassembles whole every part of his
body. Mindfulness is like that—it is the miracle which can call back in a flash our
dispersed mind and restore it to wholeness so that we can live each minute of life.
Hanh (1976, p. 14)
Mindfulness has been theoretically and empirically associated with psychological well-
being. The elements of mindfulness, namely awareness and nonjudgmental acceptance of
one's moment-to-moment experience, are regarded as potentially effective antidotes against
common forms of psychological distress—rumination, anxiety, worry, fear, anger, and so on
—many of which involve the maladaptive tendencies to avoid, suppress, or over-engage

with one's distressing thoughts and emotions (Hayes & Feldman, 2004; Kabat-Zinn, 1990).
Though promoted for centuries as a part of Buddhist and other spiritual traditions, the
application of mindfulness to psychological health in Western medical and mental health
contexts is a more recent phenomenon, largely beginning in the 1970s (e.g., Kabat-Zinn,
1982). Along with this development, there has been much theoretical and empirical work
illustrating the impact of mindfulness on psychological health. The goal of this paper is to
offer a comprehensive narrative review of the effects of mindfulness on psychological
health. We begin with an overview of the construct of mindfulness, differences between
Buddhist and Western psychological conceptualizations of mindfulness, and how
mindfulness has been integrated into Western medicine and psychology. We then review
evidence from three areas of research that shed light on the relationship between
mindfulness and psychological health: 1. correlational, cross-sectional research that
examines the relations between individual differences in trait or dispositional mindfulness
and other mental-health related traits, 2. intervention research that examines the effects of
mindfulness-oriented interventions on psychological functioning, and 3. laboratory-based
research that examines, experimentally, the effects of brief mindfulness inductions on
emotional and behavioral processes indicative of psychological health. We conclude with an
examination of mechanisms of effects of mindfulness interventions and suggestions for
future research directions.
The word mindfulness may be used to describe a psychological trait, a practice of cultivating
mindfulness (e.g., mindfulness meditation), a mode or state of awareness, or a psychological
process (Germer, Siegel, & Fulton, 2005). To minimize possible confusion, we clarify which
meaning is intended in each context we describe (Chambers, Gullone, & Allen, 2009). One
of the most commonly cited definitions of mindfulness is the awareness that arises through
“paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and
nonjudgmentally” (Kabat-Zinn, 1994, p. 4). Descriptions of mindfulness provided by most
other researchers are similar. Baer (2003), for example, defines mindfulness as “the
nonjudgmental observation of the ongoing stream of internal and external stimuli as they
arise” (p. 125). Though some researchers focus almost exclusively on the attentional aspects
of mindfulness (e.g., Brown & Ryan, 2003), most follow the model of Bishop et al. (2004),
which proposed that mindfulness encompasses two components: self-regulation of attention,
and adoption of a particular orientation towards one's experiences. Self-regulation of
attention refers to non-elaborative observation and awareness of sensations, thoughts, or
feelings from moment to moment. It requires both the ability to anchor one's attention on
what is occurring, and the ability to intentionally switch attention from one aspect of the
experience to another. Orientation to experience concerns the kind of attitude that one holds
towards one's experience, specifically an attitude of curiosity, openness, and acceptance. It is
worth noting that “acceptance” in the context of mindfulness should not be equated with
passivity or resignation (Cardaciotto, Herbert, Forman, Moitra, & Farrow, 2008). Rather,
acceptance in this context refers to the ability to experience events fully, without resorting to
either extreme of excessive preoccupation with, or suppression of, the experience. To sum
up, current conceptualizations of mindfulness in clinical psychology point to two primary,
essential elements of mindfulness: awareness of one's moment-to-moment experience
nonjudgmentally and with acceptance.
As alluded to earlier, mindfulness finds its roots in ancient spiritual traditions, and is most
systematically articulated and emphasized in Buddhism, a spiritual tradition that is at least
2550 years old. As the idea and practice of mindfulness has been introduced into Western
psychology and medicine, it is not surprising that differences emerge with regard to how
mindfulness is conceptualized within Buddhist and Western perspectives. Several
researchers (e.g., Chambers, Gullone, & Allen, 2009; Rosch, 2007) have argued that in order
to more fully appreciate the potential contribution of mindfulness in psychological health it

is important to gain an understanding of these differences, and specifically, from a Western
perspective, how mindfulness is conceptualized in Buddhism. Given the diversity of
traditions and teachings within Buddhism, an in-depth exploration of this topic is beyond the
scope of this review (for a more extensive discussion of this topic, see Rosch, 2007). We
offer a preliminary overview of differences in conceptualization of mindfulness in Western
usage versus early Buddhist teachings, specifically, those of Theravada Buddhism.
Arguably, Buddhist and Western conceptualizations of mindfulness differ in at least three
levels: contextual, process, and content. At the contextual level, mindfulness in the Buddhist
tradition is viewed as one factor of an interconnected system of practices that are necessary
for attaining liberation from suffering, the ultimate state or end goal prescribed to spiritual
practitioners in the tradition. Thus, it needs to be cultivated alongside with other spiritual
practices, such as following an ethical lifestyle, in order for one to move toward the goal of
liberation. Western conceptualization of mindfulness, on the other hand, is generally
independent of any specific circumscribed philosophy, ethical code, or system of practices.
At the process level, mindfulness, in the context of Buddhism, is to be practiced against the
psychological backdrop of reflecting on and contemplating key aspects of the Buddha's
teachings, such as impermanence, non-self, and suffering. As an example, in the
Satipatthana Sutta (The Foundation of Mindfulness Discourse), one of the key Buddhist
discourses on mindfulness, the Buddha recommended that one maintains mindfulness of
one's bodily functions, sensations and feelings, consciousness, and content of consciousness
while observing clearly the impermanent nature of these objects. Western practice generally
places less emphasis on non-self and impermanence than traditional Buddhist teachings.
Finally, at the content level and in relation to the above point, in early Buddhist teachings,
mindfulness refers rather specifically to an introspective awareness with regard to one's
physical and psychological processes and experiences. This is contrast to certain Western
conceptualizations of mindfulness, which view mindfulness as a form of awareness that
encompasses all forms of objects in one's internal and external experience, including
features of external sensory objects like sights and smells. This is not to say that external
sensory objects do not ultimately form part of one's internal experience; rather, in Buddhist
teachings, mindfulness more fundamentally has to do with observing one's perception of and
reactions toward sensory objects than focusing on features of the sensory objects
themselves.
The integration of mindfulness into Western medicine and psychology can be traced back to
the growth of Zen Buddhism in America in the 1950s and 1960s, partly through early
writings such as Zen in the Art of Archery (Herrigel, 1953), The World of Zen: An East-
West Anthology (Ross, 1960), and The Method of Zen (Herrigel, Hull, & Tausend, 1960).
Beginning the 1960s, interest in the use of meditative techniques in psychotherapy began to
grow among clinicians, especially psychoanalysts (e.g., see Boss, 1965; Fingarette, 1963;
Suzuki, Fromm, & De Martino, 1960; Watts, 1961). Through the 1960s and the 1970s, there
was growing interest within experimental psychology in examining various means of
heightening awareness and broadening the boundaries of consciousness, including
meditation. Early electroencephalogram (EEG) studies on meditation found that individuals
who meditated showed persistent alpha activity with restful reductions in metabolic rate
(Anand, Chhina, & Singh, 1961; Bagchi & Wenger, 1957; Wallace, 1970), as well as
increases in theta waves, which reflect lower states of arousal associated with sleep
(Kasamatsu & Hirai, 1966). Beginning in the early 1970s, there was a surge of interest in
and research on transcendental meditation, a form of concentrative meditation technique
popularized by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (Wallace, 1970). The practice of transcendental
meditation was found to be associated with reductions in indicators of physiological arousal
such as oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide elimination, and respiratory rate (Benson,
Rosner, Marzetta, & Klemchuk, 1974; Wallace, 1970; Wallace, Benson, & Wilson, 1971).

Despite the fact that research on mindfulness meditation had already begun in the 1960s, it
was not until the late 1970s that mindfulness meditation began to be studied as an
intervention to enhance psychological well-being. Application of mindfulness meditation as
a form of behavioral intervention for clinical problems began with the work of Jon Kabat-
Zinn, which explored the use of mindfulness meditation in treating patients with chronic
pain (Kabat-Zinn, 1982), now known popularly as Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction.
Since the establishment of MBSR, several other interventions have also been developed
using mindfulness-related principles and practices, including Mindfulness-Based Cognitive
Therapy (MBCT; Segal, Williams, & Teasdale, 2002), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT;
Linehan, 1993a) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT; Hayes, Strosahl, &
Wilson, 1999). In this review, both meditation-oriented interventions (i.e., MBSR and
MBCT), as well as interventions that teach mindfulness using less meditation-oriented
techniques (i.e., DBT and ACT), are considered as a family of “mindfulness-oriented
interventions”, and thus are of empirical interest.
Correlational Research on Mindfulness and Psychological Health
Relationship between Trait Mindfulness and Psychological Health
Many studies of mindfulness to date have reported on correlations between self-reported
mindfulness and psychological health. Such correlations have been reported for samples of
undergraduate students (e.g., Baer, Smith, Hopkins, Krietemeyer, & Toney, 2006; Brown &
Ryan, 2003), community adults (e.g., Brown & Ryan, 2003; Chadwick et al., 2008) and
clinical populations (e.g., Baer, Smith, & Allen, 2004; Chadwick et al., 2008; Walach,
Buchheld, Buttenmuller, Kleinknecht, & Schmidt, 2006). Before going over these findings,
it may be helpful to review questionnaires that have been developed to measure
mindfulness. Questionnaires that assess mindfulness as a general, trait-like tendency to be
mindful in daily life include: Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (Buchheld, Grossman, &
Walach, 2001), Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness Skills (KIMS; Baer et al., 2004),
Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS; Brown & Ryan, 2003), Five-Facet
Mindfulness Questionnaire (Baer et al., 2006), Cognitive Affective Mindfulness Scale-
Revised (Feldman, Hayes, Kumar, Greeson, & Laurenceau, 2007), Toronto Mindfulness
Scale-Trait Version (Davis, Lau, & Cairns, 2009), Philadelphia Mindfulness Scale
(Cardaciotto et al., 2008), and Southampton Mindfulness Questionnaire (Chadwick et al.,
2008). Some of these questionnaires measure mindfulness as a single-factor construct. For
example, the MAAS (Brown & Ryan, 2003) assesses mindfulness as the general tendency to
be attentive to and aware of experiences in daily life, and has a single factor structure of
open/ receptive awareness and attention. Other questionnaires measure mindfulness as a
multi-faceted construct. For example, the KIMS (Baer et al., 2004) contains subscales that
correspond to four mindfulness skills conceptualized in DBT's framework: observing one's
moment-to-moment experience, describing one's experiences with words, acting or
participating with awareness, and nonjudgmental acceptance of one's experiences. In
addition to trait measures of mindfulness, state measures of mindfulness have been
developed to measure momentary mindful states. These measures include the Toronto
Mindfulness Scale (Lau et al., 2006) and Brown and Ryan (2003)'s state version of the
MAAS.
Trait mindfulness has been associated with higher levels of life satisfaction (Brown & Ryan,
2003), agreeableness (Thompson & Waltz, 2007), conscientiousness (Giluk, 2009;
Thompson & Waltz, 2007), vitality (Brown & Ryan, 2003), self esteem (Brown & Ryan,
2003; Rasmussen & Pidgeon, 2010), empathy (Dekeyser, Raes, Leijssen, Leysen, & Dewulf,
2008), sense of autonomy (Brown & Ryan, 2003), competence (Brown & Ryan, 2003),
optimism (Brown & Ryan, 2003), and pleasant affect (Brown & Ryan, 2003). Studies have
also demonstrated significant negative correlations between mindfulness and depression

(Brown & Ryan, 2003; Cash & Whittingham, 2010), neuroticism (Dekeyser et al., 2008;
Giluk, 2009), absent-mindedness (Herndon, 2008), dissociation (Baer et al., 2006; Walach et
al., 2006), rumination (Raes & Williams, 2010), cognitive reactivity (Raes, Dewulf, Van
Heeringen, & Williams, 2009), social anxiety (Brown & Ryan, 2003; Dekeyser et al., 2008;
Rasmussen & Pidgeon, 2010), difficulties in emotion regulation (Baer et al., 2006),
experiential avoidance (Baer et al., 2004), alexithymia (Baer et al., 2004), intensity of
delusional experience in the context of psychosis (Chadwick et al., 2008), and general
psychological symptoms (Baer et al., 2006). Research also has begun to explore the
association between mindfulness and cognitive processes that may have important
implications for psychological health. For example, Frewen, Evans, Maraj, Dozois, and
Partridge (2008) found that, among undergraduate students, mindfulness was related both to
a lower frequency of negative automatic thoughts and to an enhanced ability to let go of
those thoughts. Two other studies have also demonstrated an association between
mindfulness and enhanced performance on tasks assessing sustained attention (Schmertz,
Anderson, & Robins, 2009) and persistence (Evans, Baer, & Segerstrom, 2009).
Mindfulness has been shown to be related not only to self-report measures of psychological
health, but also to differences in brain activity observed using functional neuroimaging
methods. Creswell, Way, Eisenberger, and Lieberman (2007) found that trait mindfulness
was associated with reduced bilateral amygdala activation and greater widespread prefrontal
cortical activation during an affect labeling task. There was also a strong inverse association
between prefrontal cortex and right amygdala responses among those who scored high on
mindfulness, but not among those who scored low on mindfulness, which suggests that
individuals who are mindful may be better able to regulate emotional responses via
prefrontal cortical inhibition of the amygdala. Trait mindfulness also was negatively
correlated with resting activity in the amygdala and in medial prefrontal and parietal brain
areas that are associated with self-referential processing, whereas levels of depressive
symptoms were positively correlated with resting activity in these areas (Way, Creswell,
Eisenberger, & Lieberman, 2010). These findings are consistent with the association of
mindfulness with greater self-reported ability to let go of negative thoughts about the self
(e.g., Frewen et al., 2008).
Relationship between Mindfulness Meditation and Psychological Health
Research also has examined the relationship between mindfulness meditation practices and
psychological well-being. Lykins and Baer (2009) compared meditators and non-meditators
on several indices of psychological well-being. Meditators reported significantly higher
levels of mindfulness, self-compassion and overall sense of well-being, and significantly
lower levels of psychological symptoms, rumination, thought suppression, fear of emotion,
and difficulties with emotion regulation, compared to non-meditators, and changes in these
variables were linearly associated with extent of meditation practice. In addition, the data
were consistent with a model in which trait mindfulness mediates the relationship between
extent of meditation practice and several outcome variables, including fear of emotion,
rumination, and behavioral self-regulation. In two other studies, facets of trait mindfulness
were found to mediate the relationship between meditation experience and psychological
well-being in combined samples of meditators and non-meditators (Baer et al., 2008;
Josefsson, Larsman, Broberg, & Lundh, 2011). In addition to correlations with self-report
measures, research has examined behavioral and neurobiological correlates of mindfulness
meditation. Ortner, Kilner and Zelazo (2007) used an emotional interference task in which
participants categorized tones presented 1 or 4 seconds following the onset of affective or
neutral pictures. Levels of emotional interference were indexed by differences in reaction
times to tones for affective pictures versus neutral pictures. A participant's mindfulness
meditation experience was significantly associated with reduced interference both from

unpleasant pictures (for 1 and 4 second delays) as well as pleasant pictures (for 4 second
delay only), as well as higher levels of self-reported mindfulness and psychological well-
being. These findings suggest that mindfulness meditation practice may enhance
psychological well-being by increasing mindfulness and attenuating reactivity to emotional
stimuli by facilitating disengagement of attention from stimuli. There is also emerging
evidence from studies comparing meditators and non-meditators on a variety of
performance-based measures that suggest that regular meditation practice is associated with
enhanced cognitive flexibility and attentional functioning (Hodgins & Adair, 2010; Moore
& Malinowski, 2009), outcomes that may have important implications for psychological
well-being. Research has also identified potential neurobiological correlates of mindfulness
meditation by comparing brain structure and activity in adept mindfulness meditation
practitioners to those of non-practitioners. These studies found that extensive mindfulness
meditation experience is associated with increased thickness in brain regions implicated in
attention, interoception, and sensory processing, including the prefrontal cortex and right
anterior insula (Lazar et al., 2005); increased activation in brain areas involved in processing
of distracting events and emotions, which include the rostral anterior cingulate cortex and
dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, respectively (Hölzel et al., 2007); and greater gray matter
concentration in brain areas that have been found to be active during meditation, including
the right anterior insula, left inferior temporal gyrus, and right hippocampus (Hölzel et al.,
2008). These findings are consistent with the premise that systematic training in mindfulness
meditation induces changes in attention, awareness, and emotion, which can be assessed and
identified at subjective, behavioral, and neurobiological levels (cf. Treadway & Lazar,
2009).
Overall, evidence from correlational research suggests that mindfulness is positively
associated with a variety of indicators of psychological health, such as higher levels of
positive affect, life satisfaction, vitality, and adaptive emotion regulation, and lower levels
of negative affect and psychopathological symptoms. There is also burgeoning evidence
from neurobiological and laboratory behavioral research that indicates the potential roles of
trait mindfulness and mindfulness meditation practices in reducing reactivity to emotional
stimuli and enhancing psychological well-being. Given the correlational nature of these data,
experimental studies are needed to clarify the directional links between mindfulness and
psychological well-being. Does training in mindfulness practices result in improvements in
psychological well-being? Does psychological well-being facilitate greater mindfulness and/
or inclination towards engagement in mindfulness practice? The next section reviews
empirical evidence from studies of the effects of mindfulness-oriented interventions on
psychological health.
Controlled Studies of Mindfulness-Oriented Interventions
Several mindfulness-oriented interventions have been developed and received much
research attention within the past two decades, including MBSR, MBCT, DBT and ACT.
Some research on these interventions has been uncontrolled and some has focused primarily
on physical health outcomes. In this section, we limit our review to published, peer-
reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed psychological health outcomes
in adult populations. Some other promising interventions have also incorporated
mindfulness techniques, including mindfulness-based relapse prevention (Witkiewitz,
Marlatt, & Walker, 2005) and exposure-based cognitive therapy for depression (Hayes,
Beevers, Feldman, Laurenceau, & Perlman, 2005), but no RCTs of those interventions have
yet been published.

Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR): Description of Intervention and Review of
Controlled Studies
MBSR is a group-based intervention program originally designed as an adjunct treatment for
patients with chronic pain (Kabat-Zinn, 1982; 1990). The program offers intensive training
in mindfulness meditation to help individuals relate to their physical and psychological
conditions in more accepting and nonjudgmental ways. The program consists of an eight-to-
ten week course, in which a group of up to thirty participants meet for two to two and a half
hours per week for mindfulness meditation instruction and training (Kabat-Zinn, 1990). In
addition to in-class mindfulness exercises, participants are encouraged to engage in home
mindfulness practices and attend an all-day intensive mindfulness meditation retreat. The
premise of MBSR is that with repeated training in mindfulness meditation, individuals will
eventually learn to be less reactive and judgmental toward their experiences, and more able
to recognize, and break free from, habitual and maladaptive patterns of thinking and
behavior.
A number of RCTs of MBSR have been conducted among clinical and non-clinical
populations, mostly using a waiting-list control design. Early studies were reviewed by Baer
(2003) and Grossman, Niemann, Schmidt, and Walach (2004), but several important studies
have since been published. Table 1 summarizes RCTs that have examined the impact of
MBSR on psychological functioning. Overall, these studies found that MBSR reduces self-
reported levels of anxiety (Shapiro, Schwartz, & Bonner, 1998; Anderson, Lau, Segal, &
Bishop, 2007), depression (Anderson et al., 2007; Grossman et al., 2010; Koszycki, Benger,
Shlik, & Bradwejn, 2007; Sephton et al., 2007; Shapiro et al., 1998; Speca, Carlson,
Goodey, & Angen, 2000), anger (Anderson et al., 2007), rumination (Anderson et al. 2007;
Jain et al., 2007), general psychological distress, including perceived stress (Astin, 1997;
Bränström, Kvillemo, Brandberg, & Moskowitz, 2010; Nyklíček, & Kuipers, 2008; Oman,
Shapiro, Thoresen, Plante, & Flinders, 2008; Shapiro, Astin, Bishop, & Cordova, 2005;
Speca et al., 2000; Williams, Kolar, Reger, & Pearson, 2001), cognitive disorganization
(Speca et al., 2000), post-traumatic avoidance symptoms (Bränström et al., 2010), and
medical symptoms (Williams et al., 2001). It has been found to improve positive affect
(Anderson et al., 2007; Bränström et al., 2010), Nyklíček, & Kuijpers, 2008), sense of
spirituality (Astin, 1997; Shapiro et al., 1998), empathy (Shapiro et al., 1998), sense of
cohesion (Weissbecker et al., 2002), mindfulness (Anderson et al., 2007; Shapiro, Oman,
Thoresen, Plante, & Flinders, 2008; Nyklíček, & Kuijpers, 2008), forgiveness (Oman et al.,
2008), self compassion (Shapiro et al., 2005), satisfaction with life, and quality of life
(Grossman et al., 2010; Koszycki et al., 2007; Nyklíček, & Kuijpers,2008; Shapiro et al.,
2005) among both clinical and non-clinical populations.
Participation in MBSR has also been associated with brain changes reflective of positive
emotional states and adaptive self representation and emotion regulatory processes, such as
increases in left frontal activation, which is indicative of dispositional and state positive
affect (Davidson et al., 2003), increased activation in brain regions implicated in
experiential, present-focused mode of self reference (Farb et al., 2007), and reduced
activation in brain regions implicated in conceptual processing, cognitive elaboration, and
reappraisal (Farb et al., 2010; Ochsner & Gross, 2008).
Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT): Description of Intervention and Review of
Controlled Studies
MBCT is an eight-week, manualized group intervention program adapted from the MBSR
model (Segal et al., 2002). Developed as an approach to prevent relapse in remitted
depression, MBCT combines mindfulness training and elements of cognitive therapy (CT)
with the goal of targeting vulnerability processes that have been implicated in the

maintenance of depressive episodes. Like CT, MBCT aims to help participants view
thoughts as mental events rather than as facts, recognize the role of negative automatic
thoughts in maintaining depressive symptoms, and disengage the occurrence of negative
thoughts from their negative psychological effects (Barnhofer, Crane, & Didonna, 2009).
However, unlike the traditional CT approach that places considerable emphasis on
evaluating and changing the validity of the content of thoughts and developing alternative
thoughts, MBCT aims primarily to change one's awareness of and relationship to thoughts
and emotions (Teasdale et al., 2000). The theoretical rationale on which MBCT is based
(Teasdale, Segal, & Williams, 1995) is that the negative thoughts that accompany depression
become associated with the depressed state, and that, as the number of depressive episodes
increases, negative automatic thoughts become more easily reactivated by feelings of
dysphoria, even when these do not occur in the context of a full-blown depressive episode.
The negative thoughts, in turn, increase depressed mood and other symptoms of depression,
leading to an increased risk for relapse to a major depressive episode. MBCT specifically
targets loosening the association between negative automatic thinking and dysphoria.
Because these associations are theorized to be stronger among those with a greater number
of previous episodes, they may be expected to show the greatest benefit of the intervention.
Several RCTs, summarized in Table 2, have evaluated the effects of MBCT on relapse
prevention and other depression-related outcomes (for recent reviews, see Chiesa & Serreti,
2010; Coelho, Canter, & Ernst, 2007). Consistent with the theoretical model, initial studies
found that MBCT reduced relapse rates among patients with three or more episodes of
depression, but not among those with two or fewer past episodes (Ma & Teasdale, 2004;
Teasdale et al., 2000). Subsequent studies of MBCT and depression relapse selected only
patients with three or more episodes and have replicated the effect of MBCT on reduced
relapse rates (Goldfrin & Heeringen, 2010; Kuyken et al., 2008) or prolonged time to relapse
(Bondolfi et al., 2010). Furthermore, MBCT also has been found to improve a range of
symptomatic and psychosocial outcomes among remitted depressed patients, such as
residual depressive symptoms and quality of life (Goldfrin & Heeringen, 2010; Kuyken et
al., 2008). There is also preliminary evidence that MBCT is more effective than treatment as
usual (TAU) in reducing depressive symptoms among currently depressed patients
(Barnhofer et al., 2009; Hepburn et al., 2009). Lastly, MBCT has been adapted for treatment
of bipolar disorder (Williams et al., 2008), social phobia (Piet, Hougaard, Hecksher, &
Rosenberg, 2010), and depressive symptoms among individuals with epilepsy (Thompson et
al., 2010). The results of these studies are promising and in need of further replication.
Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT): Description of Intervention and Review of Controlled
Studies
DBT (Linehan, 1993a) was first developed as a treatment for chronic suicidal and other self-
injurious behaviors, which are often present in patients with severe borderline personality
disorder (BPD). It conceptualizes the dysfunctional behaviors of individuals with BPD as a
consequence of an underlying dysfunction of the emotion regulation system, which involves
intense emotional reactivity and an inability to modulate emotions. DBT integrates elements
of traditional CBT with Zen philosophy and practice, and has a simultaneous focus on
acceptance and behavior change strategies to help patients improve their emotion regulation
abilities (Linehan, 1993a; Robins, 2002). There are four modes of treatment in DBT:
individual therapy, group skills training, telephone consultation between therapist and
patient, and consultation team meetings for therapists. Mindfulness skills are taught in the
context of the skills-training group as a way of helping patients increase self acceptance, and
as an exposure strategy aiming to reduce avoidance of difficult emotion and fear responses
(Linehan, 1993b). These skills consist of a set of mindfulness “what” skills (observe,
describe, and participate) and a set of mindfulness “how” skills (nonjudgmentally, one-

mindfully, and effectively). Specific exercises that are used to foster mindfulness include
visualizing thoughts, feelings, and sensations as if they are clouds passing by in the sky,
observing breath by counting or coordinating with footsteps, and bringing mindful
awareness into daily activities. Mindfulness skills are also integrated within the other three
skills modules, which focus on distress tolerance, emotion regulation, and interpersonal
effectiveness.
To date, 11 randomized trials of DBT, or adaptations of it, have been conducted (Lynch,
Trost, Salsman, & Linehan, 2007; Robins & Chapman, 2004). These studies are summarized
in Table 3. Standard outpatient DBT has been found to be more effective than TAU or
another active treatment in reducing frequency and severity of parasuicidal and self harm
behavior among individuals with BPD, especially those with a history of parasuicidal
behavior; reducing number of inpatient psychiatric days, emergency visits, and
hospitalizations (Koons et al., 2001; Linehan, Amstrong, Suarez, Allmon, & Heard, 1991;
Linehan et al., 2006; Verheul et al., 2003); and in reducing substance use among individuals
with co-morbid BDP and substance use disorders (Linehan et al., 1999; Linehan et al.,
2002). Among studies that included follow-up assessments, the effects of DBT were found
to last for up to one year on the following outcome measures: number of parasuicidal
behaviors, global functioning, social adjustment, and use of crisis services (Linehan et al.,
1991; Linehan et al., 2006; Linehan et al., 1999; Linehan, Heard, & Armstrong, 1993;
Linehan, Tutek, Heard, & Armstrong, 1994). Finally, modifications of DBT have been
found to be effective in binge eating disorder (Telch, Agras, and Linehan, 2001), bulimia
(Safer, Telch, & Agras, 2001), and chronic depression in the elderly (Lynch, Morse,
Mendelson & Robins, 2003).
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT): Description of Intervention and Review of
Controlled Studies
ACT (Hayes et al., 1999) was developed based on the premise that psychological distress is
often associated with attempts to control or avoid negative thoughts and emotions, which
often paradoxically increase the frequency, intensity, or salience of these internal events, and
result in further distress and inability to engage in behaviors that would lead to valued long-
term goals. Thus, the central aim of ACT is to create greater psychological flexibility by
teaching skills that increase an individual's willingness to come into fuller contact with their
experiences, recognize their values, and commit to behaviors that are consistent with those
values. There are six core treatment processes that are highlighted in ACT: acceptance,
defusion, contact with the present moment, self as context, values, and committed action
(Hayes, Luoma, Bond, Masuda, & Lillis, 2006). Mindfulness is taught in the context of the
first four processes, where a variety of exercises are used to enhance awareness of an
observing self and foster the deliteralization of thoughts and beliefs. Although ACT does not
incorporate mindfulness meditation exercises, its focus on helping patients cultivate present-
centered awareness and acceptance is consistent with that of other mindfulness-based
approaches (Baer, 2003). ACT has been delivered in both individual and group settings,
with durations varying from one day (e.g., Gregg, Callaghan, Hayes, & Glenn-Lawson,
2007) to 16 weeks (e.g., Hayes et al., 2004).
A number of studies, summarized in Table 4, have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy
of ACT in treating a range of mental health outcomes, including those associated with
depression, anxiety, impulse control disorders, schizophrenia, substance abuse and
addiction, and workplace stress (Hayes et al., 2006; Powers, Zum Vorde Sive Vording, &
Emmelkamp, 2009). Specifically, ACT has been found to be more effective than TAU in
improving affective symptoms, social functioning, and symptom reporting, and lowering
rehospitalization rates and symptom believability among psychiatric inpatients with
psychotic symptoms (Bach & Hayes, 2002; Gaudiano & Herbert, 2006). Among populations

with depressive and anxiety symptoms, ACT was generally found to be superior to no
intervention, and as effective as another established treatment in reducing levels of
depression, anxiety, and poor mental health outcomes (Bond & Bunce, 2000; Forman,
Herbert, Moitra, Yeomans, & Geller, 2007; Lappalainen et al., 2007; Zettle, 2003; Zettle &
Hayes, 1986; Zettle & Rains, 1989). In addition, ACT has been shown to be effective at
reducing substance use and dependence among nicotine-dependent (Gifford et al., 2004) and
polysubstance-abusing individuals (Hayes et al., 2004). Finally, there is preliminary
evidence indicating the effectiveness of ACT in treating trichotillomania (Woods,
Wetterneck, & Flessner, 2006).
A growing research body supports the efficacy of all four major forms of mindfulness-
oriented interventions, but several important research questions need to be addressed in
future studies. Because these interventions all involve multiple components, future research
should examine how individual treatment components, especially the mindfulness training
component, contribute to overall treatment effects. Also, these interventions differ in how
they teach mindful awareness, and future research could compare the efficacy of different
mindfulness teaching approaches in fostering greater mindful awareness in daily life. For
example, both MBSR and MBCT place considerable emphasis on engaging participants in
formal meditative practices. DBT and ACT, on the other hand, incorporate a range of
informal mindfulness exercises in their treatment approach. Research attention should also
be devoted to possible moderators of treatment effects, such as pre-existing differences in
coping style and types of cognitive processes maintaining a particular psychological
problem. Finally, research needs to examine whether there is a dose-response relationship
between amount of intervention exposure and amount of psychological benefits. Although
MBSR in its standard form involves eight weekly 2-2.5 hour classes and an all-day retreat, it
has been delivered in abbreviated forms to fit the needs of specific populations. Carmody
and Baer (2009) examined class contact hours and effect sizes of psychological outcomes
reported in published trials of MBSR, and did not find a systematic relationship between the
two variables. Another review (Vettese, Toneatto, Stea, Nguyen, & Wang, 2009) found no
consistent relationship between amount of home mindfulness meditation practice and
treatment outcomes. Taken together, these reviews do not support a dose-response
relationship between level of treatment exposure and reported psychological benefits. Other
factors, such as level of expertise of an instructor, may account for the psychological
improvements observed following MBSR or other mindfulness-based interventions, and
should be systematically measured in future studies.
Laboratory Research on Immediate Effects of Mindfulness Interventions
In addition to correlational and clinical intervention research on mindfulness, a third line of
empirical research has examined the immediate effects of brief mindfulness interventions in
controlled laboratory settings on a variety of emotion-related processes, including recovery
from dysphoric mood, emotional reactivity to aversive or emotionally provocative stimuli,
and willingness to return to or persist on an unpleasant task. Such laboratory studies have
the advantage of more easily isolating mindfulness practice from other elements typically
present in clinical intervention packages, thus allowing greater control over independent
variables and stronger conclusions about causal effects.
Several studies have examined the immediate effects of mindfulness interventions on coping
with dysphoric mood. Instructions to practice mindfulness of thoughts and feelings
following negative mood induction were found to be more effective than rumination or no
instruction in alleviating negative mood states in healthy university students (Broderick,
2005), previously depressed individuals (Singer & Dobson, 2007), and currently depressed
individuals (Huffziger & Kuehner, 2009), but not in one study of university students

(Kuehner, Huffziger, & Liebsch, 2009). As the latter authors noted, these differential
findings may result in part from differences in methods used to induce mindfulness across
studies (use of mindful self-focus statements on cards in Kuehner et al., 2009 versus
audiotaped guided meditation instructions in Broderick, 2005), and/or differences in clinical
status of study samples (e.g., beneficial effects of mindfulness may be more noticeable
among clinical populations than among healthy subjects). It is unsurprising that mindfulness
instructions would be more helpful in recovery from sad mood than rumination, which has
been shown to be maladaptive (Nolen-Hoeksema & Morrow, 1991). Mindfulness also has
been compared with other potentially adaptive mood-regulation strategies. Evidence is
mixed with regard to the relative effects of mindfulness and distraction. Whereas two studies
(Huffziger & Kuehner, 2009; Singer & Dobson, 2007) found that mindfulness and
distraction had equivalent effects on recovery from dysphoric mood, one study (Broderick,
2005) found that mindfulness was more effective than distraction and another study
(Kuehner et al., 2009) found that distraction was more effective than mindfulness. Further
studies are needed to clarify the relative effects of mindfulness and distraction on mood
regulation, and whether those effects may be moderated by situational or personality factors.
No published studies to date have compared the effects on recovery from dysphoric mood of
mindfulness and cognitive reappraisal of distressing stimuli or situations.
Studies have also examined effects of mindfulness instructions on emotional responses to
aversive or emotionally provocative stimuli. In a study by Arch and Craske (2006),
university students viewed a series of affectively-valenced pictures and rated their emotional
responses to them, both before and after one of three sets of recorded instructions to which
they were randomly assigned: focused breathing, unfocused attention, or worry. Whereas the
other two groups showed a decrease in positive emotional response to neutral slides from
pre-induction to post-induction, those assigned to the focused breathing condition
maintained consistently positive responses to neutral slides. They also reported lower
negative affect than the worry group in response to post-induction negative-valence slides
and greater willingness to view negative slides than those in the unfocused attention
condition, as indicated by viewing a greater number of additional optional negative slides.
Findings of this study were extended by a recent study by Erisman and Roemer (2010),
which found that a brief mindfulness intervention, relative to a control condition, resulted in
reduced emotion regulation difficulties and negative affect in response to an affectively-
mixed film clip. Campbell-Sills, Barlow, Brown, and Hofmann (2006) randomly assigned
patients with mood and anxiety disorders to instructions to either accept or suppress their
emotions while viewing an emotionally provocative film. The two groups reported similar
levels of subjective distress while watching the film but, relative to those in the suppression
condition, the acceptance group displayed lower heart rate while viewing the film and
reported less negative emotion during the post-film recovery period. The findings of these
studies suggest that training in two key elements of mindfulness practice (focused awareness
and acceptance) may reduce emotional reactivity to negative stimuli and increase
willingness to remain in contact with them. There is preliminary work investigating the
effects of brief mindfulness instructions on substance-related urges and substance use
behavior. Bowen and Marlatt (2009) presented college smokers either brief mindfulness
instructions or no instructions before and after exposure to a cue designed to elicit urges to
smoke. Although there was no immediate effect on urge to smoke, mindfulness instructions
resulted in significant decreases in smoking behavior during the next 7 days. As the authors
noted, mindfulness training may alter responses to urges, rather than reducing urges. These
findings were extended in another study that compared the effectiveness of using
suppression versus a mindfulness-based strategy in coping with cigarette craving among a
community sample of smokers (Rogojanski, Vettese, & Antony, 2011). The study found that
whereas both strategies reduced self-reported amount of smoking and increased self-efficacy
associated with coping with cigarette craving, only those in the mindfulness condition

reported significant decreases in negative affect and depressive symptoms and marginal
decreases in nicotine dependence.
Research has also examined the efficacy of mindfulness as an emotion regulation strategy in
response to a biological challenge, specifically to inhalations of carbon dioxide-enriched air
(CO2 challenge), a procedure that has frequently been used to create a laboratory analog of
panic attacks (Sanderson, Rapee, & Barlow, 1988). In a study by Feldner, Zvolensky, Eifert,
and Spira (2003), individuals who scored either high or low on a measure of emotional
avoidance were instructed either to mindfully observe and accept or to try to suppress
feelings during CO2 challenge. High emotional avoidance participants reported higher
anxiety than low emotional avoidance participants in the suppression condition, but not in
the observation condition. Levitt, Brown, Orsillo, and Barlow (2004) randomized patients
with panic disorder to one of three experimental conditions: a 10-minute audiotape
describing a rationale for either suppressing or accepting one's emotions, or a neutral
narrative, and then exposed them to CO2 challenge. The acceptance group reported
significantly lower levels of anxiety during the biological challenge than the other two
groups and greater willingness to participate in a second challenge. One coping strategy
commonly taught to patients with anxiety disorders, particularly panic disorder, is breathing
retraining, in which patients are taught to take deeper, slower breaths. Eifert and Heffner
(2003) compared the effects of brief acceptance training, breathing retraining, and no
training on responses to CO2 challenge in undergraduates who scored high on a measure of
anxiety sensitivity. Acceptance instructions led to less intense fear, fewer catastrophic
thoughts, and lower behavioral avoidance (indicated both by latency between trials and
reported willingness to return for another experimental session) than breathing retraining
instructions or no instructions. Collectively, these studies suggest that mindful observation
and acceptance of emotional responses may be an effective strategy for reducing subjective
anxiety and behavioral avoidance in the face of physiological arousal, among highly anxiety
sensitive or emotionally avoidant individuals and patients with panic disorder.
Laboratory studies of mindfulness have helped provide further insight into the functions of
mindfulness and the potential processes through which mindfulness lead to positive
psychological effects. The majority of the findings suggest that brief mindfulness training,
whether in the form of a short, guided meditation practice or in the form of instructions to
adopt an accepting attitude toward internal experiences, can have an immediate positive
effect on recovery from dysphoric mood and level of emotional reactivity to aversive
stimuli, consistent with the positive psychological effects reported in research on
mindfulness-oriented intervention programs. The laboratory studies also suggest that it does
not take extensive prior training in mindfulness to experience some immediate benefits of
mindfulness training.
From a methodological standpoint, it is important that future studies more closely examine
the extent to which a state of mindfulness is actually manipulated by the study instructions.
Whereas most studies did include post-experimental manipulation checks on adherence to
the training instructions, they did not explicitly assess the extent to which participants were
able to be mindfully aware of their emotions or thoughts during or after exposure to a mood
induction or a laboratory stressor. Research also could examine which training approaches
or instructions (e.g. mindful breathing or mindfulness of emotions) are most effective at
helping individuals regulate emotions in response to a stressor; whether there are key
moderator variables such as pre-existing differences in dispositional mindfulness or coping
styles; and whether effects differ by type of stressors or across different emotions. Research
is also needed to compare the effects and mechanisms of mindfulness instructions with those
of other documented emotion regulation strategies, such as cognitive reappraisal and
distraction.

Mechanisms of Effects of Mindfulness Interventions
The studies reviewed so far indicate that measures of mindful awareness are related to
various indices of psychological health and that mindfulness interventions have a positive
impact on psychological health. The next natural question, then, is how this impact comes
about. Several psychological processes, some of which may overlap, have been proposed as
potential mediators of the beneficial effects of mindfulness interventions, including
increases in mindful awareness, reperceiving (also known as decentering, metacognitive
awareness, or defusion), exposure, acceptance, attentional control, memory, values
clarification, and behavioral self-regulation.
Mindfulness training would be expected to increase scores on measures of mindfulness, and
changes in mindfulness would be expected, in turn, to predict clinical outcomes. Research
has found that mindfulness training leads to increases in self-reported trait mindfulness,
assessed by the MAAS (Anderson et al., 2007; Brown & Ryan, 2003; Carmody, Reed,
Kristeller and Merriam, 2008; Michalak, Heidenreich, Meibert, & Schulte, 2008; Shapiro,
Brown & Biegel, 2007), the CAMS-R (Greeson et al., in press) and the FFMQ (Carmody &
Baer, 2008; Robins, Keng, Ekblad, & Brantley, 2010; Shapiro et al., 2008), as well as TMS-
assessed state mindfulness (Carmody et al., 2008; Lau et al., 2006). Intervention-associated
increases in trait mindfulness, assessed by the MAAS, the KIMS, the CAMS-R, and/or the
FFMQ, have been shown to predict increases in sense of spirituality (Carmody et al., 2008;
Greeson et al., in press), self-compassion (Shapiro et al., 2007), and positive states of mind
(Bränström et al., 2010), and decreases in rumination (Shapiro et al., 2007), trait anxiety
(Shapiro et al., 2007), risk of depressive relapse (Michalak et al., 2008), posttraumatic
avoidance symptoms (Bränström et al., 2010), perceived stress (Bränström et al., 2010;
Shapiro et al., 2007), and overall psychological distress (Carmody et al., 2008). A number of
studies have also demonstrated that increases in trait mindfulness (again, assessed by the
MAAS, the KIMS, and/or the FFMQ) statistically mediated the effects of mindfulness
interventions on perceived stress (Nyklíček, & Kuipers, 2008; Shapiro et al., 2008),
rumination (Shapiro et al., 2008), cognitive reactivity (Raes et al., 2009), quality of life
(Nyklíček, & Kuipers, 2008), depressive symptoms (Kuyken et al., 2010; Shahar, Britton,
Sbarra, Figueredo, & Bootzin, 2010), and behavioral regulation (Keng, Smoski, Robins,
Ekblad, & Brantley, 2010). Lastly, one study (Carmody & Baer, 2008) demonstrated that
changes in FFMQ-assessed mindfulness at least partially mediated the relationships between
amount of formal mindfulness practice and changes in psychological well being, perceived
stress, and psychological symptoms.
Mindfulness training also is thought to increase metacognitive awareness, which is the
ability to reperceive or decenter from one's thoughts and emotions, and view them as
passing mental events rather than to identify with them or believe thoughts to be accurate
representations of reality (Hayes et al., 1999; Segal et al., 2002; Shapiro, Carlson, Astin, &
Freeman, 2006). Increased metacognitive awareness has been hypothesized to lead to
reductions in rumination (Teasdale, 1999), a process of repetitive negative thinking that has
been considered a risk factor for a number of psychological disorders (Ehring & Watkins,
2008). Preliminary evidence suggests that mindfulness training leads to increases in
metacognitive awareness (Hargus et al., 2010; Teasdale et al., 2002) and reductions in
rumination (Jain et al., 2007; Ramel, Goldin, Carmona, & McQuaid, 2004), and that
increased metacognitive awareness, or decentering, may in turn predict better clinical
outcomes such as lower rates of depressive relapses (Fresco, Segal, Buis, & Kennedy,
2007).
Exposure is another process that several authors have suggested may occur during
mindfulness practice (Baer, 2003; Kabat-Zinn, 1982; Linehan, 1993a). By intentionally

attending to experiences in a nonjudgmental and open manner, an individual may undergo a
process of desensitization through which distressing sensations, thoughts and emotions that
otherwise would be avoided become less distressing. One study has shown that participation
in MBSR is associated with significant pre- to post-intervention increases in exposure
(Carmody, Baer, Lykins, & Olendzki, 2009). A closely-related process of change that has
been highlighted in the literature is acceptance (Hayes, 1994). Several studies reported that
increases in experiential acceptance mediated the effects of ACT on a range of
psychological outcomes, including workplace stress (Bond & Bunce, 2000), smoking
cessation (Gifford et al., 2004), and functioning difficulties (Forman et al., 2007).
Because mindfulness practices involve sustaining attention on the present-moment
experience, as well as switching attention back to the present-moment experience whenever
it wanders (Bishop et al., 2004), mindfulness training may improve the ability to control
attention, which may, in turn, influence other beneficial psychological outcomes. Several
aspects of attention, each related to different neurobiological substrates, may be
distinguished (Posner & Petersen, 1990): orienting (the ability to direct attention towards a
set of stimuli and sustain attention on it), alerting (the ability to remain vigilant or receptive
towards a wide range of potential stimuli), and conflict monitoring (the ability to prioritize
attention among competing cognitive demands/tasks). Using a variety of neuropsychological
tasks, experimental studies have shown that mindfulness training is associated with
improvements in orienting (Jha, Krompinger, & Baime, 2007) and conflict monitoring
(Tang et al., 2007). Among experienced meditators, participation in an intensive
mindfulness retreat has also been associated with improved alerting (Jha et al., 2007). In
addition, mindfulness training has been associated with improvements in sustained attention
among both novice meditators (Chambers, Lo, & Allen, 2008) and experienced meditators
(Valentine & Sweet, 1999), with one study demonstrating an association between
intervention-related improvements in sustained attention and reductions in depressive
symptoms (Chambers et al., 2008). Overall, evidence suggests that mindfulness training may
affect various subcomponents of attention, and that the specific subsystems affected may
depend on the extent of previous meditation experience.
Another mechanism through which mindfulness training may influence psychological well-
being is change in memory functioning. Two studies (Hargus et al., 2010; Williams et al.,
2000) have shown that mindfulness training reduces overgeneral autobiographical memory,
a construct that has been associated with increased severity of depression and suicidality
(Kuyken & Brewin, 1995). Participation in mindfulness training has also been shown to
buffer against decreases in working memory capacity (WMC) during high stress periods,
with changes in WMC mediating the relationship between amount of mindfulness practice
and reductions in negative affect (Jha, Stanley, Kiyonaga, Wong, & Gelfand, 2010). In
addition, brief mindfulness training has been shown to reduce memory for negative stimuli
(Alberts & Thewissen, in press), a mechanism that may partly underlie the beneficial effects
of mindfulness-based interventions on emotion functioning.
Finally, values clarification and improved behavioral self-regulation may be two additional
avenues through which mindfulness training improves psychological well-being (Gratz &
Roemer, 2004; Shapiro et al., 2006). Staying present with thoughts and emotions in an
objective, open and nonjudgmental manner may facilitate a greater sense of clarity with
regard to one's values, and behaviors that are more consistent with those values. Higher
levels of self-reported mindfulness are associated with self-reports of greater engagement in
valued behaviors and interests (Brown & Ryan, 2003) and of ability to engage in goal-
directed behavior when emotionally upset (Baer et al., 2006). In addition, mindfulness
training has been found to lead to self-reported improved behavioral regulation in a
nonclinical sample (Robins et al., 2010) and reduced self-discrepancy, which is associated

with adaptive self-regulation, among recovered depressed patients with a history of
depression and suicidality (Crane et al., 2008). In another study, values clarification was
found to mediate partially the relationship between increased mindfulness/ reperceiving and
decreased psychological distress in a sample of participants who underwent MBSR
(Carmody et al., 2009).
Areas in Need of Further Research
Understanding and Quantification of Mindfulness
Because mindfulness is a construct that originates in Buddhism, and has only a brief history
in Western psychological science, it is unsurprising that there is considerable challenge in
defining, operationalizing, and quantifying it (Grossman, 2008). Although a number of self-
report inventories have been developed to assess mindfulness, they vary greatly in content
and factor structure, reflecting a lack of agreement on the meaning and nature of
mindfulness (Brown, Ryan, & Creswell, 2007). Whereas some researchers consider
mindfulness to be a one-dimensional construct referring specifically to paying attention to
the present-moment experience (e.g., Brown & Ryan, 2003; Carmody, 2009), others argue
that qualities such as curiosity, acceptance, and compassion are inherent to mindfulness
(Baer & Sauer, 2009; Feldman et al., 2007; Lau et al., 2006). Further collaborative inquiry is
needed so that researchers can reach a general agreement on the nature and meaning of
mindfulness, or at least clarify and specify which aspects of mindfulness are being addressed
in a particular study.
Several issues pertaining to the assessment of mindfulness are also worth highlighting here.
First, individual responses to questionnaire items may vary as a function of differential
understanding of the questionnaire items (Grossman, 2008), which may depend on the
extent of an individual's exposure to the idea or practice of mindfulness. One study
demonstrated that the factor structure of the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory changed within
the same group of respondents from just before to just after attending meditation retreats of
3 to 10 days (Buchheld, Grossman, & Wallach, 2001). Further research is clearly needed to
improve the construct validity of self-report mindfulness questionnaires, in part via reducing
potential variability in item functioning across meditators and non-meditators. A second
issue concerns limitations in the use of self-report measures of mindfulness, which rely on
the assumption that mindfulness is assessable by declarative knowledge (Brown et al.,
2007). It is not known how well self-reports of mindfulness correspond with actual
experiences in daily life. To make the matter more complicated, there is an inherent paradox
in using frequency of attention lapses as an index of mindfulness because the ability to
detect such lapses is contingent upon one's overall level of mindfulness (Van Dam,
Earlywine, & Borders, 2010; Van Dam, Earleywine, & Danoff-Burg, 2009). One way in
which the validity of self-report questionnaires can be improved is by developing
performance-based measures of mindfulness against which they can be calibrated, or which
can be used in multi-method assessment of the construct (Garland & Gaylord, 2009).
Specificity of Effects of Mindfulness Interventions
Little is yet known regarding for whom and under what conditions mindfulness training is
most effective, but there is some preliminary evidence to suggest that its effectiveness may
vary as a function of individual differences. Cordon, Brown, and Gibson (2009) found that
participation in MBSR resulted in greater reduction in perceived stress for individuals with
an insecure attachment style than for securely attached individuals. Another recent study
(Shapiro, Brown, Thoresen, & Plante, 2011) showed that trait mindfulness moderated the
effects of MBSR. Specifically, compared to controls, participants with higher levels of
baseline trait mindfulness demonstrated greater improvements in mindfulness, subjective

well-being, empathy, and hope, and larger decreases in perceived stress up to one year post-
intervention. MBCT is effective for reducing depressive relapses among remitted depressed
patients with a history of three or more depressive episodes, but not among patients with two
previous episodes (e.g., Teasdale et al., 2000; Ma & Teasdale, 2004). In light of these
considerations, several researchers have cautioned against the indiscriminate application of
mindfulness as a general-purpose, “cure-all” therapeutic technique, and instead advocated
for a problem formulation approach in the use of mindfulness techniques for treating
psychological conditions (Kocovski, Segal, Battista, & Didonna, 2009; Teasdale, Segal, &
Williams, 2003). In order to maximize the effectiveness and clinical utility of mindfulness
interventions, sufficient attention needs to go into tailoring them to fit the needs of specific
populations and psychological conditions. For example, treatment of disorders that primarily
involve a deficit in attentional abilities, like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),
may require that greater focus be placed on the attentional aspect of mindfulness training.
On the other hand, treatment of disorders that tend to involve excessive shame and guilt,
such as eating disorders, may benefit from greater treatment emphasis on the acceptance and
self compassion aspects of mindfulness. Finally, given that mindfulness training has been
increasingly integrated with a variety of psychotherapeutic techniques (e.g., Linehan,
1993a), it is important that future research examine how mindfulness works alongside these
psychotherapeutic techniques.
Other Potential Applications of Mindfulness Interventions
Mindfulness-oriented interventions have been shown to improve psychological health in
nonclinical populations and effectively treat a range of psychological and psychosomatic
conditions. There may be additional therapeutic applications of mindfulness training.
Researchers have reported promising results in pilot trials of mindfulness interventions for
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (Zylowska et al., 2008), bipolar disorder (Miklowitz
et al., 2009; Weber et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2008), panic disorder (Kim et al., 2010),
generalized anxiety disorder (Evans et al., 2008; Craigie, Rees, Marsh, & Nathan, 2008;
Roemer, Orsillo, & Salters-Pedneault, 2008), eating disorders (Baer, Fischer, & Huss, 2005;
Kristeller & Hallett, 1999), psychosis (Chadwick, Taylor, & Abba, 2005), and alcohol and
substance use problems (Bowen et al., 2006; Witkiewitz et al., 2005). While the data is
overall preliminary and requires further validation, the results are promising. Researchers
have also begun to investigate the application of mindfulness techniques within specific
populations and settings, such as children (Bogels, Hoogstad, van Dun, de Schutter, &
Restifo, 2008; Lee, Semple, Rosa, & Miller, 2008; Napoli, Krech, & Holley, 2005),
adolescent psychiatric outpatients (Biegel, Brown, Shapiro, & Schubert, 2009), parents
(Altmaier & Maloney, 2007; Bögels et al., 2008; Singh et al., 2006), school teachers
(Napoli, 2004), elderly and their caregivers (Epstein-Lubow, McBee, Darling, Armey, &
Miller, in press; McBee, 2008; Smith, 2004), prison inmates (Bowen et al., 2006;
Samuelson, Carmody, Kabat-Zinn, & Bratt, 2007), and socio-economically disadvantaged
individuals (Hick & Furlotte, 2010).
With regard to applications of mindfulness training that have received empirical support,
research now needs to examine practical issues surrounding their implementation, delivery,
and dissemination. Little is known about their cost effectiveness, nor about the amount and
type(s) of training that is required for an individual to be a competent provider of
mindfulness training (Allen, Blashki, & Gullone, 2006). Future research should examine
these issues as they are critical to the successful implementation and dissemination of
mindfulness-oriented interventions.

Conclusion
Based on an examination of empirical literature across multiple methodologies, this review
concludes that mindfulness and its cultivation facilitates adaptive psychological functioning.
Despite existing methodological limitations within each body of literature, there is a clear
convergence of findings from correlational studies, clinical intervention studies, and
laboratory-based, experimental studies of mindfulness—all of which suggest that
mindfulness is positively associated with psychological health, and that training in
mindfulness may bring about positive psychological effects. These effects ranged from
increased subjective well-being, reduced psychological symptoms and emotional reactivity,
to improved regulation of behavior. There is also an increasingly substantial research body
pointing to a number of psychological processes that may serve as key mechanisms of
effects of mindfulness interventions. As research on mindfulness is in its early stages of
development, further collaborative research is needed to develop a more solid understanding
concerning the nature of mindfulness, how mindfulness can best be measured, fostered, and
cultivated, and the mechanisms and specificity of effects of mindfulness-oriented
interventions. Future research should also continue to explore other potential applications of
mindfulness, and examine practical issues concerning the delivery, implementation, and
dissemination of mindfulness-oriented interventions. Given the advances that have been
made thus far, it is likely that new paradigms for the understanding and application of
mindfulness will continue to appear, which would move us further toward the goals of
alleviating human psychological suffering and helping others live a life that is happier and
more fulfilling.
