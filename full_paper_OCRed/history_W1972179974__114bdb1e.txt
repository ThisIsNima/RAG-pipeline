Introduction
Q3
Natural plant products have been used throughout human
history for various purposes. Having coevolved with life, these
natural products are billions of years old. Tens of thousands of
them are produced as secondary metabolites by the higher
plants as a natural defense against disease and infection.
Medicines derived from plants have played a pivotal role in the
health care of many cultures, both ancient and modern [1–5].
The Indian system of holistic medicine known as Ayurveda
uses mainly plant-based drugs or formulations to treat various
ailments including cancer. Of the approximately 877 small-
molecule drugs introduced worldwide between 1981 and 2002,
most (61%) can be traced back to their origins in natural
products [1]. This is not surprising since plant-based drugs

Although turmeric (Curcuma longa; an Indian spice) has been described in Ayurveda, as a
treatment for inﬂammatory diseases and is referred by different names in different cultures,
the active principle called curcumin or diferuloylmethane, a yellow pigment present in
turmeric (curry powder) has been shown to exhibit numerous activities. Extensive research
over the last half century has revealed several important functions of curcumin. It binds to a
variety of proteins and inhibits the activity of various kinases. By modulating the activation
of various transcription factors, curcumin regulates the expression of inﬂammatory
enzymes, cytokines, adhesion molecules, and cell survival proteins. Curcumin also down-
regulates cyclin D1, cyclin E and MDM2; and upregulates p21, p27, and p53. Various
preclinical cell culture and animal studies suggest that curcumin has potential as an
antiproliferative, anti-invasive, and antiangiogenic agent; as a mediator of chemoresistance
and radioresistance; as a chemopreventive agent; and as a therapeutic agent in wound
healing, diabetes, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, cardiovascular disease, pulmonary
disease, and arthritis. Pilot phase I clinical trials have shown curcumin to be safe even when
consumed at a daily dose of 12 g for 3 months. Other clinical trials suggest a potential
therapeutic role for curcumin in diseases such as familial adenomatous polyposis, inﬂam-
matory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, hypercholester-
emia, atherosclerosis, pancreatitis, psoriasis, chronic anterior uveitis and arthritis. Thus,
curcumin, a spice once relegated to the kitchen shelf, has moved into the clinic and may
prove to be ‘‘Curecumin’’.

may be more suitable – at least in biochemical terms – for
medicinal human use than the many exotic synthetic drugs
produced through combinatorial chemistry. Nonetheless,
modern medicine has neither held in very high esteem nor
encouraged the medicinal use of natural products.
Over the last two decades, however, successful attempts to
better understand molecular mechanisms of action of some
natural products have kindled interest in their therapeutic use
in modern medical settings. Remarkably, most of the natural
products experimentally evaluated so far have been found to
be nontoxic or to have effective doses far below their toxic
doses. The role of natural products in human health care
cannot be underestimated. An estimated 80% of individuals in
developing countries depend primarily on natural products to
meet their healthcare needs [6]. Recent surveys suggest that
one in three Americans uses medicinal natural products daily
and that possibly one in two cancer patients (i.e., up to 50% of
patients treated in cancer centers) uses them as well. The
current review is limited to curcumin, a natural product in use
for thousands of years
Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a polyphenol, is an active
principle of the perennial herb Curcuma longa (commonly
known as turmeric) (Fig. 1). The yellow-pigmented fraction of
turmeric contains curcuminoids, which are chemically related
to its principal ingredient, curcumin. The major curcuminoids
present in turmeric are demethoxycurcumin (curcumin II),
bisdemethoxycurcumin
(curcumin
III),
and
the
recently
identiﬁed cyclocurcumin
[7].
The
major components of
commercial curcumin are curcumin I (77%), curcumin II
(17%), and curcumin III (3%). The curcuminoid complex is
also referred to as Indian saffron, yellow ginger, yellow root,
kacha haldi, ukon, or natural yellow 3. Curcuminoids are
present in 3–5% of turmeric. Though principally cultivated in
India, Southeast Asia, China, and other Asian and tropical
countries and regions, turmeric is also common in other parts
of the world and is recognized by different names in different
languages worldwide (Table 1). [8]
Curcumin was ﬁrst isolated in 1815, obtained in crystalline
form in 1870 [9,10], and ultimately identiﬁed as 1,6-hepta-
diene-3,5-dione-1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-(1E,6E)
or diferuloylmethane. In 1910, the feruloylmethane skeleton
of curcumin was conﬁrmed and synthesized by Lampe [11].
Curcumin is a yellow-orange powder that is insoluble in water
and ether but soluble in ethanol, dimethylsulfoxide, and
acetone. Curcumin has a melting point of 183 8C, a molecular
formula of C21H20O6, and a molecular weight of 368.37 g/mol.

sold in the market are shown. The change in color of turmeric at acidic and alkaline pH is also shown. Tetrahydrocurcumin
(THC), a major metabolite of curcumin, exhibits whitish color. Alkaline turmeric (red color) is also referred as ‘‘Kumkum’’
Q15
.
The traditional Kumkum, or Kungumam as it is called in Tamil Nadu (India), is made from dried turmeric. The turmeric is
dried and powdered with a bit of slaked lime, which turns the rich yellow powder into red color. The kungumam (also
called Bindi, Bindu, Tilak or Sandoor) is an auspicious symbol. When a girl or a married woman visits a house, it is a sign of
respect (in case of an elderly lady) or blessings (in case of a young girl) to offer kumkum to them when they leave. Kumkum
is also widely used for worshipping the Hindu goddesses, especially Shakti and Lakshmi. (For interpretation of the
references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of the article.)

Spectrophotometrically, the maximum absorption (lmax) of
curcumin in methanol occurs at 430 nm and in acetone at 415–
420 nm [12]. A 1% solution of curcumin contains 1650
absorbance units. Curcumin appears brilliant yellow hue at
pH 2.5–7 and red at pH > 7. Curcumin exists in enolic and b-
diketonic forms. The fact that curcumin in solution exists
primarily in its enolic form [13] has an important bearing on
the radical-scavenging ability of curcumin.
The stability of curcumin in aqueous media improves at
high pH (>11.7) [14,15]. Although quite soluble in organic
solvents such as DMSO, ethanol, methanol, or acetone, it is
poorly soluble in aqueous solvents [16]. Curcumin is stable at
acidic pH but unstable at neutral and basic pH, under which
conditions it is degraded to ferulic acid and feruloylmethane
[15–17]. Most curcumin (>90%) is rapidly degraded within
30 min of placement in phosphate buffer systems of pH 7.2
[15,17]. The ability of antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, N-
acetylcysteine (NAC), and glutathione to prevent this degrada-
tion suggests that an oxidative mechanism is at work.
Degradation of curcumin is extremely slow at pH 1–6 [15],
as normally encountered in the stomach. In contrast, one of
curcumin’s major metabolites (tetrahydrocurcumin, or THC)
is quite stable at neutral or basic pH [18] and still possesses
antioxidant activities [19–21]. Curcumin is soluble in 0.1 M
sodium hydroxide, although it remains stable for only 1–2 h. In
comparison, curcumin is more stable in cell culture medium

Traditional uses of curcumin
Traditionally, turmeric has been put to use as a foodstuff,
cosmetic, and medicine. As a spice, it is used to provide curry
with its distinctive yellow color and ﬂavor. It is used a coloring
agent in cheese, butter, and other foods [23,24]. In folk
medicine, turmeric and natural curcuminoids have been
applied as therapeutic preparations over the centuries in
different parts of the world. In Ayurvedic medicine, curcumin

is a well-documented treatment for various respiratory
conditions (e.g., asthma, bronchial hyperactivity, and allergy)
as well as for liver disorders, anorexia, rheumatism, diabetic
wounds, runny nose, cough, and sinusitis [25]. In traditional
Chinese medicine, it is used to treat diseases associated with
abdominal pain [26]. In ancient Hindu medicine, it was used to
treat sprains and swelling [25]. Throughout the Orient, it has
traditionally been used to good therapeutic effect, particularly
as an anti-inﬂammatory [12], and many of its therapeutic
effects have been conﬁrmed by modern scientiﬁc research.
Such effects include antioxidant [27], anti-inﬂammatory
[24,28,29], anticarcinogenic and antimicrobial [30–32], hepa-
toprotective [32], thrombosuppressive [33], cardiovascular
(i.e., as protection against myocardial infarction) [29,34,35],
hypoglycemic [36–38], and antiarthritic (i.e., as protection
against rheumatoid arthritis) [39], The most compelling and
key rationale for the continuing traditional therapeutic use of
curcumin is its extremely good safety proﬁle. To date, no
studies in
either animals [40,41] or
humans [42]
have
discovered any toxicity associated with the use of curcumin,
and it is clear that curcumin is not toxic even at very high
doses.
3.
Molecular targets of curcumin
Accumulating evidence suggests that curcumin has a diverse
range of molecular targets, which supports the notion that
curcumin inﬂuences numerous biochemical and molecular
cascades (Table 2). Among its molecular targets are transcrip-
tion factors, growth factors and their receptors, cytokines,
enzymes, and genes regulating cell proliferation and apopto-
sis.
3.1.
Curcumin interacts with numerous targets
Curcumin is apparently a highly pleiotropic molecule that
interacts physically with its numerous targets (Table 3). It
binds to and inhibits the activity of enzymes, growth factor
receptors, metals, albumin, and other molecules. It binds
proteins such as P-glycoprotein [68,69], multidrug resistance
proteins 1 and 2 (MRP1 and MRP2) [59], glutathione [59], protein
kinase C, ATPase [52,53], ErbB2 [61], and alpha1-acid glyco-
protein (AGP) [50]. By directly binding small b-amyloid species,
curcumin blocks aggregation and ﬁbril formation in vitro and
in vivo [51]. Curcumin irreversibly binds CD13/aminopepti-
dase N (APN) and inhibits tumor invasion and angiogenesis
[55]. Curcumin has also been shown to inhibit the activity of
lipoxygenase by binding lipoxygenase itself [65] or binding to
phosphatidylcholine (PC) micelles and thereby inhibiting
lipoxygenase 1 [74].
3.2.
Curcumin inhibits activation of transcription factors
Curcumin is a potent inhibitor of the activation of various
transcription factors including nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB),
activated protein-1 (AP-1), signal transducer and activator of
transcription (STAT) proteins, peroxisome proliferator-acti-
vated receptor-g (PPAR-g), and b-catenin [44]. These transcrip-
tion factors regulate the expression of genes that contribute to
tumorigenesis, inﬂammation, cell survival, cell proliferation,
invasion, and angiogenesis.
3.3.
Curcumin downregulates the activity of multiple
kinases
A variety of tyrosine kinases are activated by mutations that
contribute to the malignant transformation, growth, and
metastasis of human cancers. Accordingly, protein kinases
involved in key growth signaling cascades are good candidate
targets for novel chemopreventive approaches to treat many
human cancers. For example, most human cancers over-
express epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and HER2/
neu, which ultimately stimulates the proliferation of cancer
cells [75]. Cellular experiments in vitro have shown that short-
term treatment with curcumin inhibits EGFR kinase activity
and EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR in A431
cells and depletes cells of Her2/neu protein. Similar to
geldanamycin, curcumin is extremely potent at degrading
intracellular HER2 and disrupting its tyrosine kinase activity
[76]. Additionally, as recently shown in our laboratory,
curcumin may downregulate bcl-2 expression, thereby con-
tributing to antiproliferative activity. Curcumin has also been
shown to induce apoptosis in acute T cell leukemias by
inhibiting the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/AKT pathway and
to induce G2/M arrest and nonapoptotic autophagic cell death
in malignant glioma cells by abrogating Akt and Erk signaling
pathways [77].
Curcumin’s effects are also apparently mediated through
its
inhibition
of
various
other
serine/threonine
protein
kinases. As we have previously shown, curcumin completely
inhibits the activity of several protein kinases including
phosphorylase kinase, protein kinase C (PKC), protamine
kinase (cPK), autophosphorylation-activated protein kinase

(AK), pp60c-src tyrosine kinase. Other investigators have
shown similar suppression of phorbol-12-myristate-13-acet-
ate (PMA)-induced activation of cellular PKC by curcumin
[43,44].
Most
inﬂammatory
stimuli
typically
activate
1
of

independent MAPK pathways leading to activation of the
p44/42 MAPK (also called ERK1/ERK2), JNK, or p38 MAPK
pathway, respectively. Curcumin can apparently inhibit all of
these pathways directly or indirectly, thus providing evidence
of its potent anti-inﬂammatory and anticarcinogenic effects
[43,44].
3.4.
Curcumin inhibits expression of growth and
metastases promoting genes
Overexpression of oncogenes promotes tumor cell growth and
provides an ideal platform on which to design chemopreven-
tive regimens. Cyclooxygense-2 (COX-2) is associated with a
wide variety of cancers including cancers of the colon, lung
and breast. Because of the importance of COX-2 inhibition in
human carcinogenesis, much research in the past decade has
been focused on the development of speciﬁc COX-2 inhibitors
[78]. Several studies have shown that curcumin downregulates
the expression of COX-2 protein in different tumor cell lines,
most likely through the downregulation of NF-kB activation
that is required for COX-2 activation. There is also evidence in
the literature that curcumin-induced suppression of cell
proliferation results in decreased cyclin D1 expression and
CDK4-mediated retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation. As
shown in hepatocellular cancer cells, curcumin appears to
alter the metastatic potential of tumor cells by inhibiting the
activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and MMP-2
[79]. In experiments with ex vivo cultured BALB/c mouse
peritoneal macrophages, curcumin reduced the production of
iNOS mRNA in a concentration-dependent manner. Finally,
curcumin appears to be able to exert anti-inﬂammatory and
growth-inhibitory effects on cancer cells by inhibiting the
expression of interleukin 1b (IL-1b), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and
tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) on the one hand and cyclin E
on the other [80,81].
3.5.
Curcumin inhibits expression of multiple genes/
pathways involved in apoptosis, cell invasion, and adhesion
Curcumin also operates through regulating the activities of
additional molecular
targets that
control cell adhesion,
apoptosis, and invasion. In this regard, curcumin has been
shown to be an extremely potent inhibitor of TNF-a-induced
expression of intracellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1),
vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and E-selectin in
human
umbilical
vein
endothelial
cells.
By
apparently
inhibiting the induction of steady-state transcription levels
of ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-selectin, curcumin may be inter-
fering detrimentally with the TNF-a-induced signaling event
at an early stage. Additionally, curcumin has been shown to
mediate its anticancer, chemosensitive, and radiosensitive
effects via activation of p53 and simultaneous downregulation
of MDM2 oncogene expression via the PI3K/mTOR/ETS2
pathway in human prostate cancer (PC3) and colon cancer
(HT-29) cell lines [82,83] and to induce apoptosis and nuclear
translocation and activation of p53 in human neuroblastoma
cells [84].
3.6.
Curcumin regulates activities of several enzymes that
mediate tumor growth
In addition to directly regulating the expression of candidate
genes, curcumin also appears to effectively regulate the
activities of enzymes that control tumor growth and prolif-
eration. Curcumin blocks ﬁbrosis in anti-Thy1 glomerulone-
phritis through its upregulation of hemoxygenase-1 (HO-1)
gene expression, suggesting that it has antiﬁbrotic effects in
glomerular disease [85]. Similarly, curcumin can reportedly
induce HO-1 expression through the generation of reactive
oxygen species, p38 activation, and phosphatase inhibition
[86].
Curcumin can also apparently suppress tumor cell growth
through its effects on Ras protein pathways. Ras proteins, in
order to extend their biological activity, must be isoprenylated
at a conserved cysteine residue near the carboxyl terminus
(Cys-186 in mammalian Ras p21 proteins). Previous studies
have indicated that an intermediate in the mevalonate
pathway, most likely farnesyl pyrophosphate, donates this
isoprenyl group and that inhibitors of the mevalonate path-
way might be able to block the transforming effects of Ras
oncogenes expression. Indeed, in one study evaluating such a
role for curcumin, curcumin derivatives strongly inhibited
FPTase activity, thereby suggesting another potential mechan-
ism by which curcumin might suppress cellular growth [43,44].
In another investigation, curcumin remarkably inhibited
the activity of xanthine oxidase (XO) in vitro in PMA-treated
NIH3T3 cells. Induction of XO activity is considered a major
cause of PMA-mediated tumor promotion, and curcumin’s
marked ability to inhibit PMA-induced increases in such
activity appears to lie in its direct inactivation of the XO
protein [43,44].
4.
Preclinical studies of curcumin
4.1.
Curcumin is a potent chemopreventive agent
Numerous studies in rodent models argue for curcumin’s
chemopreventive potential in cancer (Table 4). Curcumin can
reportedly suppress the tumorigenic activity of a wide variety
of carcinogens in cancers of the colon, duodenum, esophagus,
forestomach, stomach, liver, breast, leukemia, oral cavity, and
prostate. In studies in mice, curcumin was able to inhibit 7,12-
dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-initiated and 12-O-tetra-
decanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-promoted skin tumor for-
mation [31,120,126]. Curcumin has also shown an ability to
inhibit the mammary tumor-initiating activity of DMBA [110]
and the in vivo formation of mammary DMBA–DNA adducts in
female rats [111] and to exert chemopreventive activity when
administered during the promotion/progression stage of colon
carcinogenesis [91]. Meanwhile, one group has studied not
only curcumin’s chemopreventive effects but also its effects
on the initiation or post-initiation phase of N-nitrosomethyl-
benzylamine (NMBA)-induced esophageal carcinogenesis in
male F344 rats [100]. Using a slightly different approach,

another group investigated curcumin’s ability to prevent
tumors in C57BL/6J-Min/+ (Min/+) mice that bear a germline
mutation
in
the
APC
gene
and
spontaneously
develop
numerous intestinal adenomas by 15 weeks of age [127].
The data obtained in that study were corroborated by a later
study of the effects of curcumin on apoptosis and tumorigen-
esis in male apc (min) mice treated with the human dietary
carcinogen 2-amino 1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine
(PhIP) [92].
At least one study has examined curcumin’s preventive
effect on the development of adenomas in the intestinal tract
of C57BL/6J-Min/+ mice, a model of human familial adeno-
matous polyposis (FAP) [102]. Another group reported that,
during the initiation phases of azoxymethane-induced colonic
carcinogenesis, azoxymethane inhibits the expression of
colonic COX-1 expression without affecting that of COX-2
[128]. However, they also found that simultaneous treatment
with dietary curcumin may increase COX-2 expression to
compensate for the azoxymethane-induced reduction of COX-
1 expression.
In another recent study, the effects of curcumin adminis-
tered at a daily dose of 100 mg/kg were investigated in an
animal (Wistar rat) model of N-nitrosodiethylamine (DENA)-
initiated and phenobarbital (PB)-induced hepatocarcinogen-
esis [129]. In a recent follow-up study, the investigators in that
study have substantiated this ﬁnding by reporting that
100 mg/kg curcumin daily prevented the reduction of defen-
sive hepatic glutathione antioxidant activity, decreased lipid
peroxidation, and minimized the histological alterations
induced by DENA/PB [130]. In another study, investigators
found that the administration of curcumin and a synthetic
analog to nicotine-treated Wistar rats over a period of 22
weeks enhanced biochemical marker enzyme and lipid
proﬁles [131]. In a study in rodents, curcumin was able to
inhibit the development of N-methyl-N0-nitro-N-nitrosogua-
nidine (MNNG)-induced stomach cancer [106], an effect that
may be mediated in part by an ability to suppress the
proliferation of Helicobacter pylori (the major pathogen in
human gastric cancer) [132].
4.2.
Curcumin inhibits proliferation of tumor cells in vitro
Curcumin has the ability to inhibit the proliferation of an
extremely wide array of cancer cell types in vitro. This
includes cells from cancers of the bladder, breast, lung,
pancreas, prostate, cervix, head and neck, ovary, kidney, and
brain; and osteosarcoma, leukemia and melanoma [12].
4.3.
Curcumin exhibits antitumor activity in animals
Besides the extensive in vitro demonstrations of curcumin’s
antiproliferative effects, numerous other studies have eval-
uated its efﬁcacy in various animal models in vivo (Table 5).
The ﬁrst animal studies of curcumin’s antitumor effects –
performed with ascitic lymphoma cells in mice – were
reported in 1985 by Kuttan et al. [133]. More recently, others
have
studied
the
antitumoral
and inhibitory
effects of
curcumin on melanoma cells [141] and melanoma lung
metastasis in mice [147].
Other studies in vivo have investigated the effects of
curcumin on tumor angiogenesis and the biomarkers COX-2
and VEGF in hepatocellular carcinoma cells implanted in
nude mice [148]. One group demonstrated that systemic
administration of curcumin for 6 consecutive days to rats
bearing the highly cachectic Yoshida AH-130 ascites hepa-
toma signiﬁcantly inhibited tumor growth [149]. Meanwhile,
others have shown that curcumin can suppress the growth of
head and neck carcinoma [140], modulate the growth of
prostate cancer in rodents [145], and inhibit the growth of
human pancreatic cancer in nude mice, in part by suppres-
sing
angiogenesis
and
inducing
apoptosis
as
reported
recently [143].

More recent studies have evaluated curcumin’s chemo-
sensitizing and radiosensitizing effects. Our group [135]
evaluated the chemosensitizing effect of curcumin in combi-
nation with paclitaxel on breast cancer metastases to the lung.
Others examined the effects of curcumin on human breast
cancer (MDA-MB-231) cells in an immunodeﬁcient mouse
model of metastasis [136] and observed that the number of
lung metastases signiﬁcantly decreased after intercardiac
injection of curcumin, a clear demonstration of curcumin’s
promise for dietary chemoprevention of metastases [136].
In our laboratory, we have recently investigated curcumin’s
effects alone and in combination against several cancers. We
have found that (a) the combination of curcumin and
gemcitabine inhibits pancreatic cancer growth in nude mice
by inhibiting NF-kB regulated gene expression, cell prolifera-
tion, and angiogenesis [144]; (b) the combination of curcumin
and docetaxel is effective against human ovarian cancer in
nude mice [142]; (c) curcumin can suppress the growth of
human glioblastoma
in
rodents [77];
and (d) curcumin
sensitizes colon cancers in nude mice to oxaliplatin [137]. In
addition, other recent studies have shown that curcumin
sensitizes prostate cancers to chemotherapeutics and radia-
tion by downregulating expression of the MDM2 oncogene
[82]. Together, these in vivo animal studies clearly suggest
curcumin’s anticancer potential when administered either
alone or in combination with currently employed chemother-
apeutic agents or radiation.
5.
Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
studies of curcumin in animals and humans
The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of curcumin
have been widely investigated. Perhaps the ﬁrst study to
examine the uptake, distribution, and excretion of curcumin
was conducted in 1978 by Wahlstrom and Blennow in
Sprague-Dawley rats [150]. When administered orally at a
dose of 1 g/kg, approximately 75% of the ingested curcumin
was excreted in the feces and only negligible amounts in the
urine. As indicated by blood plasma levels and biliary
excretion, curcumin was poorly absorbed from the gut. No
apparent toxic effects were seen after doses of up to 5 g/kg.
When intravenously injected, curcumin was actively trans-
ported into the bile. Most of the drug was metabolized,
however, again suggesting poor absorption and rapid meta-
bolism. Later, Holder et al. [151] administered deuterium- and
tritium-labeled curcumin orally and intraperitoneally to rats
and, like Wahlstrom and Blennow, found that most of it was
excreted in the feces. When they administered curcumin
intravenously and intraperitoneally to cannulated rats, the
curcumin
was
excreted
in
the
bile.
The
major
biliary
metabolites were glucuronides of tetrahydrocurcumin (THC)
and hexahydrocurcumin (HHC); the minor biliary metabolite
was dihydroferulic acid accompanied by traces of ferulic acid.
In another study in which 400 mg curcumin was administered
orally to rats, most of the administered curcumin (40%) was
excreted unchanged in the feces, none in the urine (although
curcumin glucuronide and sulfates were detected there), and
none in heart blood (although traces were found in portal
blood, liver, and kidney) [152]. Thirty minutes after adminis-
tration, 90% of the curcumin had appeared in the stomach and
small intestine; by 24 h, only 1% remained there [152]. In
another study by the same investigators, tritium-labeled
curcumin administered at doses of 400, 80, and 10 mg was
laterdetectableintheblood, liver,and kidney. Atall three doses,
the labeled curcumin was eliminated mainly through the feces
and negligibly through the urine. At the two lowest doses (80
and 10 mg), most of the labeled curcumin was excreted within
72 h; conversely, at 400 mg, considerable amounts of labeled
curcumin were still present in the tissues of interest 12 days
after administration. The percentage of curcumin absorbed (60–
66% of the given dose) remained constant regardless of the dose
administered [153], indicating that increasing the dose of
curcumin did not necessarily result in higher absorption.
In 1999, Pan et al. [18] investigated the pharmacokinetics of
curcumin in mice. They found that, within the ﬁrst 15 min
after intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of curcumin (0.1 g/
kg), plasma curcumin levels had already reached 2.25 mg/mL
(Fig. 2)
Q5
. One hour after administration, curcumin levels in the
intestines, spleen, liver, and kidneys had reached 177.04,
26.06, 26.90, and 7.51 mg/g, respectively, but only trace levels
(0.41 mg/g) in the brain. In comparison, after oral administra-
tion of 1 g/kg curcumin, serum plasma levels peaked at 0.5 mM.
Pan et al. also found curcumin-glucuronoside, dihydrocurcu-
min-glucuronoside, THC-glucuronoside, and THC to be the
major metabolites of curcumin in vivo. Together, these results
agree with those of Ireson et al. [154,155], who examined
curcumin metabolites in both rats and humans. As several
groups have shown, the liver appears to be the major organ
responsible for metabolism of curcumin [150,156,157]. Exam-
ining rat liver tissue slices for the presence of curcumin
metabolites, Hoehle and coworkers observed several reductive
metabolites including THC, HHC, and octahydrocurcumin
(OHC) and noted a predominance of OHC in males versus THC
in females. They also identiﬁed both glucuronide and sulfate
conjugates of THC, HHC, and OHC. This suggests that
curcumin undergoes extensive reduction, most likely via
alcohol dehydrogenase, before conjugation. In a Min/+ mouse
model of FAP, Perkins et al. [102] examined the pharmacoki-
netics of curcumin administered either in the diet or in 14C-
labeled form as a single intraperitoneal dose. Though detected
in only trace amounts in the plasma, curcumin was detected at
levels ranging from 39 to 240 nmol/g in the small intestinal
mucosa. The radiolabled curcumin disappeared rapidly from
tissues and plasma within 2–8 h after dosing. On the basis of
their ﬁndings, Perkins et al. concluded that a daily dose of 1.6 g
of curcumin is required for efﬁcacy in humans. More recently,
in a study examining the tissue distribution of radiolabeled
ﬂuoropropyl-substituted curcumin mice, Ryu et al. found that
curcumin bound to b-amyloid plaques in the brain, thereby
suggesting its possible use for brain imaging (Fig. 2) [158].
Pharmacokinetic studies in humans have generally pro-
duced similar data though not always. In contrast to the case in
rodents,oraldosingofcurcuminat4–8 g inone studyresultedin

patients given oral curcumin (36–180 mg) daily for up to 4
months, metabolites were not detected in the blood or urine but
were detected in the feces [160]. In another study, Garcea et al.

was taken up by both normal and malignant colorectal tissues
and that it decreased M(1)G but not COX2 levels.
As most of these studies indicate, curcumin has poor
bioavailability, and several groups have investigated ways to
enhance it. Piperine has been shown to signiﬁcantly enhance
curcumin’s bioavailability in studies involving both rats and
healthy human volunteers. In brief, Shoba et al. [162]
combined curcumin with piperine, a known inhibitor of
hepatic and intestinal glucuronidation, and examined the
resulting serum levels of curcumin. In the rat studies,
administration of curcumin alone at a dose of 2 g/kg, resulted
in moderate serum concentrations over 4 h. In contrast,
concomitant administration with piperine 20 mg/kg increased
for a short period the serum concentration of curcumin,
signiﬁcantly increased the time to maximum concentration
while signiﬁcantly decreasing elimination half-life and clear-
ance, and increased bioavailability by 154%. In humans, on the
other hand, administration of curcumin alone resulted in
undetectable
or
trace
amounts
in
the
serum,
whereas
concomitant administration with piperine 20 mg/kg produced
much higher concentrations and increased bioavailability by
an astonishing 2000%. In another study in
rats, other
investigators found that a formulation of curcumin phospha-
tidylcholine given orally enhanced curcumin’s bioavailability
ﬁve-fold in plasma and in liver; but levels were lower in
gastrointestinal mucosa [163]. Meanwhile, other attempts to
increase the bioavailability of curcumin have been made,
including the use of liposomal curcumin [143], nanoparticles
of curcumin [164], and synthetic analogues of curcumin [165].
Whether curcumin metabolites are as active as curcumin
itself is not clear. Although most studies indicate that
curcumin glucuronides and THC are less active than curcumin
[154,166], others suggest otherwise [20,21,89,167–172]. The
differences in results so far are most likely due to the assays
employed. For example, the phenolic glucuronides of curcu-
min and its natural congeners, but not the parent compounds,
have been shown to inhibit the assembly of microtubule
proteins under cell-free conditions, implying that the glucur-
onides are chemically reactive [167].

Clinical studies of curcumin
In response to the growing mass of in vitro and in vivo
evidence for curcumin’s chemopreventive and therapeutic
efﬁcacy, a number of clinical trials over the past two and a half
decades have addressed the pharmacokinetics, safety, and
efﬁcacy of curcumin in humans (Table 6). Although these trials
have concerned numerous inﬂammatory diseases including
cancer, our focus in the sections to come will be on those
dealing with cancers.
6.1.
Curcumin is extremely safe and well tolerated
The
potential
use
of
curcumin
in
chemopreventive
or
therapeutic settings has raised the obvious issues of toxicity
and tolerance. At least three different phase I clinical trials
indicate that curcumin is well tolerated when taken at doses
as high as 12 g/day [159,162] (Table 6). These results were
recently conﬁrmed in an elegant dose-escalation trial to
determine curcumin’s maximum tolerated dose and safety
[193]. In that trial, a standardized powder extract of uniformly
milled curcumin (C3 ComplexTM, Sabinsa Corporation), was
administered to 24 healthy volunteers at single doses ranging
from 500 to 12,000 mg. Remarkably, only minimal, non-dose-
related toxicity was seen and then only in seven subjects
(30%). No curcumin was detected in the serum of subjects
administered 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 6000 or 8000 mg and only
low levels in two subjects administered 10,000 or 12,000 mg.
6.2.
Curcumin has anti-inﬂammatory and antirheumatic
activity
Rheumatoid arthritis is a frequent complication in the elderly,
and most treatments aim at reducing the temporary symp-
toms attributable to the underlying inﬂammatory activity
[194]. The need for new treatment approaches has led to the
recent introduction of potent disease-modifying antirheu-
matic drugs (DMARDs), whose clinical beneﬁts are unfortu-
nately offset by their high cost and frequently undesirable side
effects. Curcumin has been considered as an alternative.
In the ﬁrst clinical trial of curcumin’s efﬁcacy as an
antirheumatic,
investigators
compared
its
antirheumatic
potential with that of phenylbutazone in a short-term,
double-blind, crossover study involving 18 relatively young
patients (age range, 22–48 years) [39]. Each subject received a
daily dose of either curcumin (1200 mg) or phenylbutazone
(300 mg) for 2 weeks. At the dose used, curcumin was well
tolerated, had no side effects, and exerted an antirheumatic
activity comparable to that of phenylbutazone.
Meanwhile, in a study of curcumin’s anti-inﬂammatory
properties, Satoskar et al. [173] evaluated curcumin’s effects
on spermatic cord edema and tenderness in 46 men between
15 and 68 years old who had just undergone surgical repair of
an inguinal hernia and/or hydrocele. After surgery, subjects
were
randomly
assigned
to
receive
curcumin
(400 mg),
phenylbutazone (100 mg), or placebo (250 mg lactose) three
times a day on postoperative days 1–5. As in a previous study
by Deodhar et al. [39], curcumin was deemed quite safe and,
along with phenylbutazone, elicited much better anti-inﬂam-
matory responses than placebo did [173].
6.3.
Curcumin has potential as palliative therapy for
cancerous skin lesions
External sebaceous neoplasms (e.g., actinic keratosis, super-
ﬁcial basal cell carcinoma, and external genital warts) have
traditionally been treated topically with corticosteroid creams.
In a study by Kuttan et al. [174], curcumin’s efﬁcacy when
applied as either an ethanol extract of turmeric or as an
ointment to external cancerous skin lesions was evaluated in
62 patients. Regardless of the application, curcumin provided
remarkable symptomatic relief that was in many cases
relatively durable (lasting several months) and in all cases
(except for a single adverse reaction in one subject) extremely
safe. Its effects included less itching in almost all cases,

Curcumin lowers serum cholesterol and lipid peroxide
levels in healthy individuals
While investigating the mechanisms of curcumin’s chemo-
preventive effects, in another study, Kuttan and coworker
[175] monitored curcumin’s effect on serum cholesterol and
lipid peroxide levels in 10 healthy volunteers. Daily admin-
istration of curcumin (500 mg) for 7 days led to a signiﬁcant
33% decrease in serum lipid peroxides, a 29% increase in
serum HDL cholesterol, and a nearly 12% decrease in total
serum cholesterol. Together, these striking ﬁndings suggest a
potential chemopreventive role for curcumin in arterial
diseases [175]. In Concordant with these ﬁndings are results

[176].
6.5.
Curcumin may prevent gallstone formation
Curcumin has been evaluated for its ability to induce gall
bladder emptying and thus reduce gallstone formation, a
potential risk factor for gall bladder cancer. Agents that can
induce the gall bladder to contract and empty itself (e.g.,
erythromycin, fatty meals, and amino acids) have been
shown to reduce gallstone formation. In a randomized,
double-blind, crossover study involving 12 healthy volun-
teers [178], 20 mg curcumin produced a positive cholekinetic
effect that led to 29% contraction of the gall bladder. A
subsequent study indicated that doses of 40 and 80 mg
curcumin produced 50% and 72% contraction of the gall
bladder volume, respectively. Together, these results suggest
that curcumin can effectively induce the gall bladder to
empty and thereby reduce the risk of gallstone formation and
ultimately gall bladder cancer.
6.6.
Curcumin is effective in patients with chronic anterior
uveitis and idiopathic inﬂammatory orbital pseudotumors
Curcumin’s anti-inﬂammatory effect has also been evaluated
in two rare inﬂammatory diseases—chronic anterior uveitis
(CAU) and idiopathic inﬂammatory orbital pseudotumors
(IIOTs). In a study by Lal et al. [180] involving patients with
CAU, curcumin was administered orally at a dose of 375 mg
three times a day for 12 weeks. Patients were segregated into
two groups: 18 patients who received curcumin alone and 14
patients who, in addition to CAU, had a strong reaction to a
PPD tuberculosis test and so received antitubercular treat-
ment in addition to curcumin. Patients in both groups began
showing improving after 2 weeks of treatment, although
those in the combination therapy group had a better response
rate of 86%. Moreover, at 3 years of follow-up, the recurrence
rate was much lower in the combination therapy group than
in the group treated with curcumin only (36% versus 55%).
Although approximately one in ﬁve patients in each treat-
ment group lost their vision in the follow-up period because of
various complications of the primary disease (e.g., vitritis,
macular edema, central venous block, cataract formation,
and glaucomatous optic nerve damage), none reported any
side effects of the curcumin therapy, In fact, in terms of safety
and efﬁcacy, curcumin compared favorably with the only
current standard treatment for CAU (i.e., corticosteroid
therapy).
Encouraged by this clinical study, Lal et al. [181] proceeded
to evaluate curcumin as treatment for IIOT and found it to
be both safe and effective. In that relatively small study,
eight patients took curcumin orally at a dose of 375 mg three
times a day for 6–22 months and were followed up every 3
months for 2 years. Although only ﬁve patients completed
the study, four of them recovered completely and the ﬁfth
experienced a complete resolution of tumor-related swelling
despite some residual limits on range of motion. Just
as encouraging was the lack of any recurrence or side
effects.
6.7.
Curcumin beneﬁcially affects psoriasis
Curcumin has also been shown to have beneﬁcial effects on
psoriasis, another proinﬂammatory and potentially arthritis-
inducing skin disease. In one particular study, Heng et al. [182]
evaluated
curcumin’s
antipsoriatic
effects
indirectly
by
measuring its inﬂuence on phosphorylase kinase activity.
(Curcumin is a potent selective inhibitor of phosphorylase
kinase, increased levels of which are considered by some to be
a surrogate marker of psoriatic disease.) Phosphorylase kinase
activity was assayed in four groups of 10 patients each: (i)
those with active untreated psoriasis; (ii) those with resolving
psoriasis treated with calcipotriol, a vitamin D3 analogue and
an indirect inhibitor of phosphorylase kinase; (iii) those with
resolving psoriasis treated with curcumin; and (iv) normal
nonpsoriatic subjects. Phosphorylase kinase activity was
highest in the patients with active untreated psoriasis,
lower in the calcipotriol-treated group, even lower in the
curcumin-treated group, and lowest in normal subjects.
Interestingly, the decreased phosphorylase kinase activity in
calcipotriol- and curcumin-treated patients was associated
with corresponding decreases in the expression of keratino-
cyte transferrin receptor (TRR), severity of parakeratosis, and
density of epidermal CD8+ T cells.
6.8.
Curcumin safely exerts chemopreventive effects
against multiple human cancers
Apparently, curcumin can also safely exert chemopreventive
effects on premalignant lesions. In a prospective phase I dose-
escalation study, Chen et al. [195] examined the safety,
efﬁcacy, and pharmacokinetics of curcumin in 25 patients
with a variety of high-risk
Q7
. Precancerous lesions (i.e., recently
resected urinary bladder cancer (n = 2), arsenic Bowen’s
disease of the skin (n = 6), uterine cervical intraepithelial
neoplasm [CIN] (n = 4), oral leukoplakia (n = 7), and intestinal
metaplasia of the stomach (n = 6)). Curcumin was adminis-
tered to the ﬁrst three patients at a starting dose of 500 mg/day
for 3 months and, if no grade 2 or higher toxicities were
observed, was increased to 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000, and ﬁnally
12,000 mg/day. Curcumin was not toxic at doses of 8000 mg/
day or lower, reaching peak serum concentrations at 1–2 h
(0.51  0.11 mM at 4000 mg, 0.63  0.06 mM at 6000 mg, and
1.77  1.87 mM at 8000 mg) and being gradually eliminated
(principally through nonurinary routes) within 12 h. Although
frank malignancies occurred despite curcumin treatment in
one patient each with CIN and oral leukoplakia, a remarkable
number of patients (i.e., one patient with recently resected
bladder cancer, two with oral leukoplakia, one with intestinal
metaplasia of the stomach, one with CIN, and two with
Bowen’s disease) showed histologic improvement of their
precancerous lesions.
6.9.
Curcumin modulates biomarkers of colorectal cancer
Curcumin can also apparently modulate biomarkers of color-
ectal cancer. In a pilot dose-escalation study in 15 patients
with drug-resistant advanced colorectal cancer, Sharma et al.

doses ranging from 440 to 2200 mg/day for up to 4 months.
(Depending on the dose, each capsule contained 36–180 mg of
curcumin.) The compound’s effects were measured in terms
of its effects on two surrogate biomarkers (i.e., glutathione-S-
transferase [GST] activity and DNA adducts formed between
M(1)G and malondialdehyde) in blood cells. The compound
was deemed safe and effective after the investigators observed
no dose-limiting toxicity and a signiﬁcant (59%) decrease in
GST activity at the lowest dose (440 mg) but none at higher
doses and clinically effective, and radiologically stable disease
in 33% (5/15) of patients after 2–4 months of treatment.
In
a
subsequent
dose-escalation
study
in
a
similar
population, Sharma et al. [183] further explored the pharma-
cology of curcumin administered in capsules at daily doses
ranging from 0.45 to 3.6 g daily for up to 4 months. This time,
the compound’s effects on leukocytes were measured in terms
of three potential biomarkers: GST activity, deoxyguanosine
adduct M(1)G levels, and PGE2 production ex vivo. In a
comparison of inducible PGE2 production immediately before
and 1 h after dosing on days 1 and 29, the highest dose (3.6 g)
elicited signiﬁcant decreases (62% and 57%, respectively).
Consequently, the investigators chose the 3.6 g dose for
further evaluation in a phase II trial in cancers outside the
gastrointestinal tract.
In a subsequent and similar study, the same investigators
asked whether pharmacologically active levels of curcumin
could be achieved in the colorectum of colorectal cancer
patients [161]. Encapsulated curcumin was administered
orally at three different daily doses (3600, 1800, or 450 mg)
for 7 days. Its biodistribution was then assayed by comparing
curcumin
levels
in
biopsied
specimens
of
normal
and
malignant colorectal tissue obtained at diagnosis and 6–7 h
after the last curcumin dose, measuring the levels of M(1)G
and COX-2 protein in blood samples obtained 1 h after the last
curcumin dose, and quantitating blood levels of curcumin and
its metabolites by high-performance liquid chromatography
and UV spectrophotometry or mass spectrometry. At the
highest dose (3600 mg), the concentrations of curcumin
differed between normal and malignant tissues (12.7  5.7
versus 7.7  1.8 nmol/g). However, both normal and malignant
tissues from patients so treated contained curcumin sulfate
and curcumin glucuronide, and their peripheral circulation
contained trace amounts of curcumin. Furthermore, the DNA
adduct M(1)G was 2.5 times more abundant in cancerous
tissues than in normal tissues. At the highest dose (3600 mg),
curcumin lowered M1G levels (from 4.8  2.9 to 2.0  1.8
adducts per 107 nucleotides) but not COX-2 protein levels in
cancerous tissues
Q8
. Together, these results suggested that
curcumin orally administered at a dose of 3600 mg could reach
pharmacologically efﬁcacious levels in the colorectum while
at the same time being negligibly distributed outside the gut
[161].
6.10.
Curcumin helps reduce symptoms of irritable bowel
syndrome
There is evidence that curcumin may help relieve symptoms
of the extremely common gastric disorder known as irritable
bowel syndrome (IBS). This chronic condition is characterized
by abdominal pain, alterations in bowel habits and stool
frequency, and poor quality of life and appears to be causally
associated with antibiotic use and inﬂammatory infection. In a
partially blinded, randomized, pilot study in which 207
healthy adults were randomly assigned to receive either one
or two tablets of a standardized turmeric extract daily for 8
weeks, IBS symptoms improved signiﬁcantly after treatment
[184].
In a study by another group of investigators, oral curcumin
was administered in daily doses ranging from 450 to 3600 mg
to 12 patients about to undergo surgery for hepatic metastases
of colorectal cancer to determine whether enough of the
curcumin would reach normal and malignant human liver
tissue in concentrations sufﬁcient to elicit pharmacologic
activity [156]. The compound’s resulting poor bioavailability
(as indicated by low nanomolar levels of the parent compound
and its glucuronide and sulfate conjugates in the peripheral or
portal circulation) led the investigators to conclude that
achieving pharmacologically effective concentrations of cur-
cumin in the liver is not feasible.
6.11.
Curcumin improves early renal graft function
Curcumin has also been shown to beneﬁcially inﬂuence early
kidney graft function, presumably due to its known ability to
induce the activity of the antioxidant hemoxygenase-1. In a
randomized, placebo-controlled trial, a combination of cur-
cumin 480 mg and quercetin 20 mg was administered orally in
capsule form to cadaveric kidney transplant recipients for 1
month, starting immediately after transplantation. The trial’s
43 subjects were randomly assigned to placebo (control), low-
dose (one capsule + one placebo), or high dose (two capsule)
regimens [185]. Graft function was assessed in terms of
delayed graft function (i.e., the need for dialysis in the ﬁrst
week after transplantation) and slowed graft function (i.e.,
serum creatinine >2.5 mg/dL by post-transplantation day 10).
The investigators consequently observed much better early
graft function in treated patients than in controls (71% [low-
dose] versus 93% [high-dose] versus 43% [controls]), no
delayed graft function in any treated patients but delayed
function in 14% (2/14) of controls, and signiﬁcantly lower
serum creatinine levels in treated patients after 2 and 30 days
of treatment. They also noted signiﬁcantly higher levels of
urinary HO-1 in the two active treatment groups. Interestingly,
however, when compared with both the low-dose and control
regimens, only the high-dose regimen appeared to lower the
incidence of acute graft rejection at 6 months posttransplan-
tation (0% versus 14.3%) and reduce the incidence of tremors
(13% versus 46%).

Curcumin improves clinical outcome in patients with
tropical pancreatitis
Curcumin appears to improve the clinical outcomes of
patients suffering from chronic pancreatitis, an intensely
painful inﬂammatory condition induced by oxidative stress,
by reversing lipid peroxidation. As shown in a randomized,
placebo-controlled pilot study involving 20 patients with
tropical
pancreatitis,
an
oral
combination
of
curcumin
500 mg and piperine 5 mg provided effective pain relief and
beneﬁcially modulated a pair of markers of oxidative stress

Curcumin is therapeutic in patients with
inﬂammatory bowel disease
Curcumin also appears to have beneﬁcial therapeutic effects
on inﬂammatory bowel disease. Marked by chronic inﬂam-
mation of the colon and encompassing both ulcerative colitis
and Crohn’s disease, inﬂammatory bowel disease is a
frequent complication of and risk factor for colorectal cancer
in humans. In a preliminary open-label study based on its
preclinically established anti-inﬂammatory and antioxidant
properties, curcumin was administered to a small popula-
tion of patients with previously treated ulcerative proctitis
(n = 5) or Crohn’s disease (n = 5) [187]. The ﬁve patients with
ulcerative proctitis, who had been previously treated with 5-
aminosalicyclic acid (5ASA) compounds and (in four cases)
corticosteroids, received curcumin orally at a dose of 550 mg
twice daily for 1 month and then three times daily for
another month. The ﬁve patients with Crohn’s disease
received curcumin orally at a dose of 360 mg (one capsule)
three times daily for 1 month and then 360 mg (four
capsules) four times daily for another 2 months. By study’s
end, all ﬁve cases of ulcerative proctitis had signiﬁcantly
improved to the point that two patients stopped taking
5ASAs and two others (including one who stopped taking
prednisone) reduced their 5ASA dosages, This improvement
was documented in terms of a return to normal limits of the
inﬂammatory indices of sedimentation rate and C-reactive
protein (CRP) level. Meanwhile, although only four of ﬁve
Crohn’s disease patients completed the study, those four
experienced also marked clinical improvement after curcu-
min treatment, as evidenced by reductions in several indices
including Crohn’s disease activity index (CDAI) scores,
sedimentation rate (i.e., a mean reduction of 10 mm/h,
and CRP (i.e., a mean reduction of 0.1 mg/dL). Moreover,
these four patients continued to show signiﬁcant sympto-
matic improvement (i.e., more formed stools, less frequent
bowel movements, and less abdominal pain and cramping)
at monthly follow-up visits. In light of these extremely
encouraging
ﬁndings,
the
investigators
concluded
that
double-blind
placebo-controlled
follow-up
studies
were
warranted.
In a subsequent randomized, double-blind, placebo-con-
trolled multicenter trial [188], Hanai et al. demonstrated
curcumin’s ability to safely and effectively prevent the relapse
of quiescent ulcerative colitis when delivered as maintenance
therapy. The 89 patients enrolled in the trial were randomly
assigned to a 6-month regimen of either placebo (n = 44) or
curcumin 1000 mg after breakfast and 1000 mg after dinner
(n = 45) in combination with sulfasalazine or mesalamine.
After 6 months of treatment, the relapse rate among evaluable
patients (n = 82) was signiﬁcantly higher in the placebo group
(20.5% [8/39]) than in the curcumin-treated group (4.7% [2/43]).
Curcumin
also
appeared
to
suppress
disease-associated
morbidity, as assessed in terms of clinical activity index
(CAI) and endoscopic index (EI) scores. After an additional 6-
month follow-up period, during which patients in both groups
took sulfasalazine or mesalamine, another 8 curcumin-
treated patients and another 6 placebo-treated patients
experienced a disease relapse.
6.14.
Curcumin reduces polyp numbers in patients with
familial adenomatous polyposis
Curcumin also appears to safely exert beneﬁcial effects in
patients with FAP, an autosomal-dominant disorder char-
acterized by the formation of hundreds of colorectal adeno-
mas and eventually the development of colorectal cancer.
Typically, the growth of the adenomatous polyps is controlled
in part by treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory
drugs and COX-2 inhibitors, despite the considerable side
effects. Therefore, in a very small clinical trial, Cruz-Correa
et al. [189] evaluated curcumin’s ability to induce adenoma
regression in previously colectomized patients with FAP, In all
ﬁve cases, combination treatment with curcumin 480 mg and
quercetin 20 mg orally three times a day for a mean duration of
6 months signiﬁcantly decreased mean polyp number and size
by 60.4% and 50.9%, respectively, without producing any
noticeable toxic side effects.
6.15.
Curcumin may improve cognitive function in the
elderly
Despite preclinical evidence of curcumin’s ability to bind b-
amyloids and thereby reduce plaque burdens [51], there has
been little, if any, supporting epidemiologic evidence of this.
However, in a recent large, population-based study of 1010
elderly nondemented Asians, those who consumed curry
‘‘occasionally’’ and ‘‘often or very often’’ scored signiﬁcantly
better on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), a
established measure of cognitive function, than did those
who ‘‘never or rarely’’ consumed curry [190]. At the least, this
ﬁnding warrants further investigation of curcumin’s cognitive
effects.
6.16.
Curcumin may beneﬁcially inﬂuence several cancer
precursor conditions
In addition to the published studies reviewed above, several
other trials have been investigating curcumin’s therapeutic
and chemopreventive potential in certain cancer precursor
conditions. One of them, a small 18-month study involving 24
human subjects and still in progress, is investigating curcu-
min’s effect on prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), a
precursor of prostate cancer, when given in combination with
a herbal product called zyﬂamend [191]. Another study,
recently reported, found curcumin to exert beneﬁcial effects
in patients with H. pylori infection, a precursor of gastric cancer
[192].
6.17.
Curcumin has potential in advanced pancreatic
cancer
Curcumin has also been examined as a single-agent in
patients with advanced pancreatic cancer [196]. A dose of
8 g curcumin per day was administered for 2 months. The
results of this study showed that curcumin is well tolerated
and a sign of biological activity found in most patients.

Ongoing clinical trials of curcumin
Enthusiasm for further studies of curcumin’s chemopre-
ventive and therapeutic effects continues to grow. Three

curcumin
in
hepatocellular
carcinoma,
gastric
cancer,
and colon cancer are ongoing in Japan. Here in the United
States, several randomized and nonrandomized phase I/II
trials (www.ClinicalTrials.gov) are investigating curcumin’s
effects on a range of human malignancies (e.g., colorectal
cancer, aberrant crypt foci, FAP, pancreatic cancer, multiple
myeloma, Alzheimer’s disease, myelodysplastic syndrome,
and psoriasis) when given alone or in conjunction with
other natural substances or nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory

Five ongoing phase I/II trials are studying curcumin’s
preventive and therapeutic effects on colorectal cancers in
patients
with
FAP
and
ACF.
Two-phase

trials
are
interrogating the effects of curcumin in advanced pancrea-
tic cancers. An Israeli trial is investigating the combined
effects
of curcumin and gemcitabine in patients with
chemotherapy-naı¨ve, locally advanced or metastatic ade-
nocarcinomas of the pancreas, while an exploratory clinical
trial in the United States is testing the efﬁcacy of curcumin
alone in patients with unresectable or metastatic pancreatic
cancers.

trials
are
evaluating
the

two doses of curcumin C3 complex versus placebo in
patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease. An
Israeli clinical trial is investigating the clinical efﬁcacy of
curcumin alone or in combination with coenzyme Q10 in
patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). At M.D.
Anderson Cancer Center, a pilot trial of curcumin alone or in
combination with bioprine (a

Adverse effects of curcumin
Though curcumin is demonstrably bioactive and nontoxic,
there are rare anecdotal reports of its deleterious side effects
under certain conditions. Frank et al. [197] reported that
copper-bound curcumin loses its ability to inhibit liver and
kidney tumors in Cinnamon rats. Others have noted that
curcumin can exhibit some blood-thinning properties such as
suppression of platelet aggregation, although it remains to be
established whether curcumin interacts in any way with
blood-thinning drugs. Although several published studies
suggest that curcumin may beneﬁcially induce apoptosis in
part through its induction of p53 expression [198], at least two
other studies suggest that curcumin may instead have a
deleterious, antiapoptotic effect by downregulating p53
[199,200]. Similarly, although dozens of studies indicate that
curcumin potentiates the effect of chemotherapeutic agents,
at least one study done in mice suggests that a curcumin-
supplemented diet may inhibit the antiproliferative effects of
cyclophosphamide on breast cancer growth (the investiga-
tors in that study, however, monitored tumor growth for only
3 days)

[201]. There have also been reports of curcumin-
induced allergic contact dermatitis [202,203] and urticaria in
humans.

Conclusions
Extensive research over the last half century has made clear
that most chronic illnesses can only be cured by multi-
targeted, as opposed to mono-targeted, therapy [204–206] and
that promiscuous targeting of a disease cell’s multiple bypass
mechanisms is a therapeutic virtue [207]. Consequently,
agents that can modulate multiple cellular targets are now
attractive objects of research. As this review has shown,
curcumin is one such agent and has the potential to treat a
variety of diseases. More extensive, well-controlled clinical
trials are now needed to fully evaluate its potential in terms of
optimal dose, route of administration, and disease targets and
potential interactions with other drugs. In light of the long and
established experience with curcumin as a foodstuff and as a
natural
medicine
in
humans,
its
low
cost,
its
proven
chemopreventive and therapeutic potential, and its pharma-
cological safety, curcumin is moving rapidly from the kitchen
shelf toward the clinic.
