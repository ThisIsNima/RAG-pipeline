ABSTRACT
With a standard set of primers directed
toward conserved regions, we have used the polymerase chain
reaction to amplify homologous segments ofmtDNA from more
than 100 animal species, including mammals, birds, amphib-
ians, fishes, and some invertebrates. Amplification and direct
sequencing were possible using unpurified mtDNA from nano-
gram samples of fresh specimens and microgram amounts of
tissues preserved for months in alcohol or decades in the dry
state. The bird and fish sequences evolve with the same strong
bias toward transitions that holds for mammals. However,
because the light strand of birds is deficient in thymine,
thymine to cytosine transitions are less common than in other
taxa. Amino acid replacement in a segment of the cytochrome
b gene is faster in mammals and birds than in fishes and the
pattern of replacements fits the structural hypothesis for
cytochrome b. The unexpectedly wide taxonomic utility ofthese
primers offers opportunities for phylogenetic and population
research.
During the past decade, geneticists and taxonomists have
used restriction endonucleases rather than sequencing to
examine variation within and between species in specific
segments ofDNA (1-7). Although the indirect assessment of
sequence variation obtained with the restriction endonucle-
ase method is known to have many drawbacks,§ sequence
data have been difficult to obtain. The construction and
screening of clone libraries has been too tedious and have
demanded too much expertise for routine use by those
geneticists and taxonomists who must analyze many individ-
uals.
Dependence on restriction analysis has limited our under-
standing of the dynamics of DNA sequence evolution. The
presence or absence of a restriction site reveals little about
the kinds of nucleotide substitutions that have occurred.
Thus, although restriction analysis of mtDNA from closely
related mammals first showed that these genomes have a
higher rate of evolutionary substitution than does nuclear
DNA, the demonstration that this acceleration results mainly
from an increase in the number of transitions relative to
transversions came only from conventional cloning and se-
quencing (1, 3). Because most studies of animal mtDNA have
used restriction analysis, it has been difficult to determine
whether a high rate of evolution and a transition bias are
characteristic of all animal mtDNAs (8-10). There has been
a need for simple methods of sequencing mtDNA to examine
the pattern of evolutionary substitution in other animal
groups.
A fast alternative to conventional cloning has emerged in
the form of the polymerase chain reaction (11). By using this
method, unique sequences can be cloned in vitro in a matter
of hours. Furthermore, the procedure is easily automated, so
that hundreds of samples can be amplified each day. The
enzymatic amplification of a specific DNA segment is made
possible by the highly specific binding of oligonucleotide
primers to sequences flanking the segment. These primers
allow the binding of a DNA polymerase that then copies the
segment. Because each newly made copy can serve as a
template for further duplication, the number of copies of the
target segment grows exponentially (12). Wrischnik et al. (13)
found an easy way to sequence the product of this reaction
directly. The direct sequencing approach has since been
improved (14) and applied to the study of mtDNA variation
within the human species (13, 15-17).
Because mtDNA differences among animal species are
large (3), it was not expected that primers that amplified
specific segments of human mtDNA would amplify the
corresponding segments of mtDNA from other species.
Nonetheless, we now describe three pairs of primers that
amplify homologous sequences from a wide array of animals.
This innovation has allowed us to gather sequence data$ to
evaluate the pattern of molecular evolution in a variety of
animal species.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Primers. To design these primers, we compared the pub-
lished sequences for mammal (18-20), frog (21), and fly (22)
mtDNAs and searched for highly conserved regions. The
sequences of the seven primers follow, the letters L and H
refer to the light and heavy strands, and the number refers to
the position of the 3' base of the primer in the complete
human mtDNA sequence (18): cytochrome b, L14841
(5'-AAAAAGCTTCCATCCAACATCTCAGCATGATGA-
AA-3') and H15149 (5'-AAACTGCAGCCCCTCAGAATG-
ATATTTGTCCTCA-3'); 12S rRNA, L1091 (5'-AAAAAG-
CTTCAAACTGGGATTAGATACCCCACTAT-3')
and
H1478 (5'-TGACTGCAGAGGGTGACGGGCGGTGTGT-
3'); control region, L15926 (5'-TCAAAGCTTACACCAGT-
CTTGTAAACC-3'), L16007 (5'-CCCAAAGCTAAAATTC-
TAA-3'), and H00651 (5'-TAACTGCAGAAGGCTAGGA-
CCAAACCT-3').
§The preparation and alignment of restriction maps is itself tedious
and subject to errors. Restriction sites offer a biased sample of
nucleotide sequences. It is hard to compare results from different
laboratories because of variation in the gel separation techniques
and restriction enzymes used. When applied to mtDNA, the re-
striction method is reliable only among closely related taxa. Re-
striction analysis is limited to the small proportion of species in the
biosphere that are big enough to provide milligram amounts oftissue
or that can be cultured. The traces of short, modified DNA that
survive in museum specimens or ancient remains cannot be ana-
lyzed with restriction enzymes.
$The sequences reported in this paper have been deposited in the

Many such priming regions exist, so that it is possible to
amplify almost any segment of a mtDNA genome at will. In
choosing oligonucleotide sequences, we took advantage of
the evolutionary stability of regions of rRNA, the anticodon
loops of tRNAs, and the active sites of enzymes. The 3' ends
of primers were located on the first or second base of codons
for amino acids that
are evolutionarily conserved
(e.g.,
tryptophan). Even primers with several mismatches to the
template
can be used for amplification; the polymerase
requires absolute matching of the primer to the template only
in the last few bases of the 3' end of the oligonucleotide.
DNA Extraction. DNA was extracted from tissues by
digestion in 100mM Tris HCI, pH 8.0/10mM EDTA/100 mM
NaCI/0.1% SDS/50 mM dithiothreitol/proteinase K (0.5
gg/ml) for 2-4 hr at 37TC. The DNA was purified by
extracting twice with phenol, once with phenol/chloroform
[1:1 (vol/vol)], and once with chloroform. The sample was
then concentrated by centrifugal dialysis (Centricon-30, Am-
icon) or ethanol precipitation.
Polymerase Chain Reaction. Amplification was performed
in 100 1.l of a solution containing 67mM Tris (pH 8.8), 6.7 mM
MgSO4, 16.6 mM (NH4)2SO4, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol,
each dNTP at 1 mM, each primer at 1 ,uM, genomic DNA
(10-1000 ng), and 2-5 units of Thermus aquaticus polymerase
(Perkin-Elmer/Cetus). Each cycle of the polymerase chain
reaction consisted of denaturation for 1 min at 930C, hybrid-
ization for 1 min at 50'C, and extension for 2-5 min at 720C.
This cycle was repeated 25-40 times depending on the initial
concentration of template DNA in the sample.
Generation of Single-Stranded DNA and Sequencing. Elec-
trophoresis of 5 gl of the amplified mixture was done in a 2%
agarose gel (NuSieve, FMC) in 40 mM Tris acetate (pH 8.0)
and the DNA was stained with ethidium bromide. The gel
fragment containing the amplified product was excised from
the gel and melted in 1 ml of distilled water, and 1 .ul of this
mixture was used as the template in a second chain reaction
to generate single-stranded DNA for sequencing (14). In this
second reaction, the concentration of one or the other primer
was reduced 100-fold. After 40 cycles of amplification, free
nucleotides and salts were removed by 2-4 cycles of centrif-
ugal dialysis. The DNA was sequenced with a commercial kit
(Sequenase, United States Biochemical) and the primer that
had been limiting in the second chain reaction.

cytochrome b gene not only from humans but also from most
other vertebrates tested (Table 1). Likewise, the second pair
of primers amplifies a 386-base-pair segment of the small
rRNA (12S rRNA) from animals as diferent as humans,
fishes, and insects (Table 1). The third set amplifies the
control region ofmtDNA (about 1 kilobase) in most mammals
and many fishes (Table 1).
It Was Not Necessary to Purify mtDNA Prior to Amplifica-
tion. Preparations of total cellular DNA are sufficient for
amplification using the polymerase chain reaction. More-
over, the amounts of tissue needed to produce a sequence
were small, typically afew nanograms offresh tissue and less
than a milligram for old specimens. This is consistent with
observations made on single hairs (16) and single sperm (23).
Many of the tissues used were from museum specimens
stored at room temperature. Dry skins collected in 1911 were
the source, of some of the rodent results, and fish tissues
stored in 70% ethanol for months were also reliable sources
of amplifiable mtDNA (Table 1). In each case the amplifica-
tion products were pure enough to sequence directly, as
shown in Fig. 1.
Patterns of mtDNA Sequence Evolution. Fig. 2 presents a
subset of the sequences we have obtained to illustrate the
utility of the approach. The DNA sequences coding for 80
amino acids ofcytochrome b are aligned for five rodents, five
birds, five fishes, and a human. These sequences are invari-
ant at 111 of the 239 base positions examined. The differences
found at the remaining 128 positions are all due to base
substitutions of the types expected for a protein-coding gene
in an animal mitochondrion (3, 9).
Among very close relatives such as species within a genus
(e.g., rodents 1-4, birds 1-4, and fishes 1-4 in Fig. 2) most
of the changes are transitions at synonymous sites. By
contrast, among more distant relatives such as genera within
a family or order (e.g., rodent 5 vs. other rodents, bird 5 vs.
other birds, and fish 5 vs. other fishes), transversions are
more evident (Fig. 3). Still more distant comparisons, as
between orders or classes of vertebrates, reveal that the
extent of difference due to transversions reaches a plateau
within orders. For example, the number of transversion
differences observed between rodent 5 and other rodents
(mean = 27 transversions) is nearly the same as between
rodent 5 and fish 1 (mean = 38 transversions). Nevertheless,
such a plateau or saturation effect is not so evident for amino
acid replacements. The number ofreplacements rises from an

FIG. 3.
Tree analysis of cytochrome b sequences in Fig. 2.
Species labels correspond to Table 1. Numbers of transversion
differences among pairs of species appear above the diagonal and
numbers of transitions are below. The most parsimonious trees
deduced by a character-state analysis of the data are shown. The
branch lengths of the trees are drawn proportional to the number of
transversions on each lineage, with each transition being considered
equivalent to 0.1 transversion (24). These trees are consistent with
previous concepts of phylogeny for these groups (25-27).

an average of 23 differences between birds and fishes. These
findings are consistent with the view that transitions occur
more often than transversions and that amino acid replace-

circles show amino acid residues that vary among the vertebrate

ments occur less often than transversions at synonymous
positions in cytochrome b codons (cf. refs. 3 and 9).
Pattern of Replacement Fits with the Structural Hypothesis
for Cytochrome b. Fig. 4 presents a structural hypothesis for
cytochrome b in the mitochondrial membrane (28). Amino
acid replacements are mainly conservative and at positions
known to differ between yeast and mammals. No replace-
ments were evident at positions thought to be essential for
function (namely, positions 80, 83, 97, and 100). Besides
reinforcing the structural model, this result confirms the idea
that direct sequencing of enzymatically amplified DNA is at
least as reliable as conventional cloning and sequencing (29).
Ifthe polymerase chain reaction were generating errors, they
would probably be distributed at random with respect to
position within codons and to codons within the cytochrome
b gene.
DISCUSSION
The fact that primers of broad utility could be found for the
fast-evolving mtDNA of animals simply by comparing frog
and mammal mtDNAs makes
it likely that "universal"
primers can also be designed for parts of the nuclear, bac-
terial, chloroplastid, and plant mitochondrial genomes. The
only requirements for the construction of such primers are
reference sequences from two or three widely diverged
creatures. The necessity for cloning is thus bypassed and
sequences can then be obtained directly by the polymerase
chain reaction for most other members of the clade that
contains the reference organisms and frequently for allied
clades.
Phylogenetic Trees. These short sequences from a piece of
the cytochrome b gene contain phylogenetic information
extending from the intraspecific level to the intergeneric
level. This is evident from comparing trees based on these
sequences (Fig. 3) with other evidence concerning the phy-
logenetic relationships among these animals. In all three
cases examined the cytochrome b sequences within a genus
are more related to one another than to those in other genera.
Furthermore, the relationships within genera agree with
expectations based on other evidence (see references in Fig.
3). There are also a few base positions at which all members
tested within a major group are uniquely alike (e.g., in codons
57, 61, 72, 74, 75, 109, 122, and 123 of birds; Fig. 2). Hence
this short sequence is a versatile source of phylogenetic
information. By contrast, the restriction endonuclease ap-
proach applied to whole mtDNA has a limited phylogenetic
range, being useful mainly at orbelow the genus level (3, 4, 30).
Unusual Base Composition of Bird mtDNA. In Table 2 we
present the base composition at the silent positions of cy-
tochrome b codons. Rodents, birds, and fishes all exhibit the
low incidence of guanines, which has been reported for
vertebrate mtDNA (18-20). Striking is the deficiency of
thymines at silent positions in the birds studied. A corre-
sponding deficiency exists in the frequency of thymine to
cytosine changes during bird evolution. An expected conse-
quence of this compositional bias is that the sequence dif-

FIG. 5.
Numbers of amino acid replacements in a segment of
cytochrome b in three vertebrate lineages. The rate of replacement
is about S times lower in the lineage leading to fish (F) than on those
leading to birds (B) or rodents (R).
ference measured at such sites can never become very large
(cf.
ref. 9). This finding points to the need for a more
comprehensive study of substitution matrices (31) and com-
positional bias in avian mtDNA before these sequences are
used for studying deep branches in the avian tree.
Slow Amino Acid Change in Fishes. Another notable out-
come of this comparative study concerns the tempo of amino
acid replacement in mitochondrially encoded proteins. Again,
the parsimony principle was used to apportion changes on a
tree of known topology relating rodents to birds and fishes.
This topology and the times of splitting of the lineages leading
to these three groups appear in Fig. 5. During nearly 400
million years ofevolution only about 4 changes have occurred
on the fish lineages, which contrasts with the 14 to 15 changes
on the bird and mammal lineages during the last 300 million
years. The results in Fig. 5 suggest a 5-fold higher rate ofamino
acid substitution on the bird and mammal lineages. This
finding fits with other evidence implying low rates of amino
acid substitution in the mitochondrial genes ofother fishes and
of invertebrates (9, 32). Because our results come from only a
small segment of one gene, it is clearly desirable to conduct a
more comprehensive survey of protein-coding genes. If the
unusually high rates of amino acid substitution in birds and
mammals are confirmed it will become possible to reconcile
the conflicting claims concerning rates ofmtDNA evolution in
major groups of animals (e.g., refs. 8-10).
Prospects. It is possible to imagine numerous applications
of this method. For instance, it will now be possible to follow
gene frequency changes through time using both old museum
specimens and modern representatives of a population
(W.K.T., S.P., F.X.V., and A.C.W., unpublished data).
Second, it will be possible to begin to organize knowledge of
genetic diversity in natural populations of minute organisms
that are not easily grown in the laboratory. A single-cell
planktonic organism contains enough mtDNA molecules for
successful amplification and sequencing. The ability to com-
pare individuals in this way could have a profound effect on
ecological genetics, especially in the marine biosphere. Fi-
nally, the ease with which homologous sequences can be
gathered will facilitate a synergism between molecular and
evolutionary biology, which will lead to insights into genetic
structure and function (33) based on the dynamics of molec-
ular change and phylogenetic history.
