Abstract
Hybridization has many and varied impacts on the process of speciation.
Hybridization may slow or reverse differentiation by allowing gene ﬂow and
recombination. It may accelerate speciation via adaptive introgression or cause
near-instantaneous speciation by allopolyploidization. It may have multiple
effects at different stages and in different spatial contexts within a single specia-
tion event. We offer a perspective on the context and evolutionary signiﬁcance of
hybridization during speciation, highlighting issues of current interest and debate.
In secondary contact zones, it is uncertain if barriers to gene ﬂow will be strength-
ened or broken down due to recombination and gene ﬂow. Theory and empirical
evidence suggest the latter is more likely, except within and around strongly
selected genomic regions. Hybridization may contribute to speciation through the
formation of new hybrid taxa, whereas introgression of a few loci may promote
adaptive divergence and so facilitate speciation. Gene regulatory networks, epige-
netic effects and the evolution of selﬁsh genetic material in the genome suggest
that the Dobzhansky–Muller model of hybrid incompatibilities requires a broader
interpretation. Finally, although the incidence of reinforcement remains uncer-
tain, this and other interactions in areas of sympatry may have knock-on effects
on speciation both within and outside regions of hybridization.

Introduction
If hybridization is deﬁned as reproduction between
members of genetically distinct populations (Barton &
Hewitt, 1985), producing offspring of mixed ancestry,
then it occurs in almost all proposed processes of
speciation. The only exceptions would be cases of com-
pletely allopatric or instantaneous speciation. Hybridiza-
tion may cause interactions involving a wide range of
types and levels of genetic divergence between the
parental forms. This divergence may have accumulated
in different ways including neutral divergence, local
adaptation and coevolution. Any of these may generate
novel
phenotypes
through
interactions
in
hybrids,
including both advantages of transgressive segregation
and disadvantages mediated by intrinsic or environ-
mentally
mediated
incompatibilities.
Therefore,
the
consequences of hybridization and the role it might
play
in
promoting
or
retarding
speciation
can
be
expected to vary widely both between different hybrid-
izing taxa and at different stages of divergence.
Hybridization may occur in many different spatial
contexts (Fig. 1). Some of these have been studied
intensively, most notably the formation of hybrid zones
at abrupt parapatric boundaries (Harrison, 1993) and
the exchange of genes between locally adapted popula-
tions, such as host races in phytophagous insects (Dres
& Mallet, 2002), where there may be no spatial separa-
tion at scales above typical dispersal distances. Hybrid-
ization
may
also
differ
in
temporal
context,
for
example, secondary contact after a period of indepen-
dent evolution vs. continuous contact with divergent
selection. Hybridization may follow habitat disturbance,
range expansion or both (as in Senecio, Abbott et al.,
2003; or baboons, Zinner et al., 2009; for example) and
may occur in complex habitat mosaics combining some
of the features of hybrid zones with those of local
adaptation (as in Louisiana Iris, Arnold et al., 2012;
Allonemobius crickets, Ross & Harrison, 2002; or Mytilus
bivalves, Bierne et al., 2003).
Hybridization may be common and widespread, spa-
tially or temporally localized or globally rare. It may
inﬂuence a rare interacting population much more
strongly than an abundant population, and its conse-
quences
may
depend
on
whether
populations
are
growing or contracting, local or invasive (Currat et al.,
2008). In all cases, the pattern of contemporary hybrid-
ization is potentially only a single snapshot of a com-
plex
and
continuously
changing
interaction.
The
evolution of complete reproductive isolation may take
hundreds to millions of generations. During this time,
populations change in size and spatial distribution, per-
haps
cyclically
due
to
periodical
climate
changes
(Hewitt, 1996, 2011), and the processes that enhance
or erode barriers to gene exchange, including hybridiza-
tion, may occur at different stages or locations during
this extended history (Fig. 1). Although many of the
debates concerning outcomes of hybridization refer to
speciﬁc scenarios, it is important to keep this spatial
and temporal context in mind when considering the
broad signiﬁcance of hybridization.
In the context of speciation, hybridization may have
several distinct outcomes, which have attracted very
different levels of research interest. First, there may be
a stable, or at least persistent, balance between selec-
tion and hybridization, with only some parts of the
genome introgressing between hybridizing populations.
This may be true both in tension zones (hybrid zones
involving a balance between selection against hybrids
and dispersal; Barton & Hewitt, 1985) and in popula-
tions adapted to distinct habitats (Nosil et al., 2009).
In either case, there may be no progress towards specia-
tion but existing differentiation may be maintained,
with the potential for future divergence when circum-
stances change. Alternatively, barriers to gene exchange
may breakdown in such a situation, leading to a reduc-
tion or loss of differentiation (e.g. Taylor et al., 2006).
The opposite type of outcome involves an increase in
the strength of any barriers to gene exchange and a
progression towards larger areas of the genome being
protected from introgression (Wu, 2001; Via, 2009).
This outcome, where hybridization initiates speciation,
is that which has probably attracted greatest contro-
versy and therefore is given more attention here. Rein-
forcement (Servedio & Noor, 2003) is an example of
one process that might be involved, where a premating
barrier evolves in response to reduced hybrid ﬁtness.
Finally, and distinctly, hybridization might contribute
to adaptive divergence between populations, and it
might also result in the generation of new populations
of mixed ancestry that remain distinct from both paren-
tal populations (hybrid speciation: Mallet, 2007; Abbott
et al., 2010). These new populations may be sexual or
asexual, homoploid or polyploid. We do not consider
asexual hybrid lineages here, but see Bullini (1994)
for a review. Reinforcement and hybrid speciation, in
particular,
may
have
subsequent
knock-on
effects,
facilitating or catalysing further speciation through the
differences they generate between populations that are
exposed to hybridization and those that are not.
Recent reviews of aspects of speciation (e.g. Fitzpatrick
et al., 2009; Nosil et al., 2009; Sobel et al., 2010; Wolf
et al., 2010a; Nei & Nozawa, 2011; Smadja & Butlin,
2011) have touched on the role of hybridization in spe-
ciation, but none has explicitly dealt with a discussion
of
the
central
role
of
hybridization
in
species
divergence. Here, we recognize that hybridization is
widespread, diverse in form and in its potential to con-
tribute to individual speciation events. We focus on
identifying key areas of current uncertainty, especially
about the circumstances in which the different out-
comes introduced above might be more or less likely.
We aim to clarify the nature and importance of open
questions in these areas and, wherever possible, suggest

ways for tackling them. First, we consider alternative
outcomes: (i) The development of barriers to gene ﬂow
and the factors that promote ﬁssion rather than fusion
of hybridizing populations and (ii) The contribution
that hybridization makes to adaptive divergence and to
the origin of new hybrid species. We then discuss the
genetic and genomic foundations of these divergent
processes, and ﬁnally, we look at some of their longer-
term consequences.
Hybridization and the development of
genetic barriers to gene ﬂow
Barriers to gene exchange might accumulate during
periods when gene ﬂow does not occur due to spatial
isolation or physical obstacles to dispersal. However,
it is common for populations that have developed
incomplete reproductive barriers to be in contact at
some stage of divergence, often due to range change,
allowing the opportunity for gene ﬂow between them.
A critical question in speciation is whether, under these
conditions, initial divergence breaks down or barriers to
gene ﬂow are enhanced and promote speciation. The-
ory suggests that this will largely depend on the overall
antagonism
between
selection
and
recombination
among diverging loci (Felsenstein, 1981). For incom-
pletely isolated populations to progress towards specia-
tion,
associations
among
the
loci
that
inﬂuence
isolation must build up (Smadja & Butlin, 2011). This
implies that gene ﬂow is further reduced either at indi-
vidual barrier loci or across a greater fraction of the
genome through associations with these loci (we deﬁne
‘barrier loci’ as those under divergent selection or that
contribute to reduced hybrid ﬁtness or to assortative
mating). Loci that do not contribute to reproductive
isolation or are not closely linked to loci that confer
some
degree
of
isolation
are
likely
to
introgress
between hybridizing populations (Barton & Bengtsson,
1986). This raises the important question of what
patterns of genomic differentiation we expect to see
between diverging taxa: How many genomic regions
differentiate during speciation? How small are regions
where divergence signiﬁcantly exceeds the genomic
average (sometimes called islands, continents or signa-
tures of divergence in the genome, see Turner et al.,
2005; Nosil et al., 2009; Michel et al., 2010)? How are
regions of exceptional divergence dispersed around the
genome? We suggest that recent discussions of these
issues in the context of ecological speciation would
beneﬁt from closer attention to well-established cline
theory.
What does cline theory teach us about the
development of isolating barriers?
Cline theory provides a framework for understanding
the dynamics of reproductive barriers in the face of
gene ﬂow. Single-locus barriers to gene ﬂow are rarely
absolute and protect only closely linked loci from intro-
gression. Associations between very many barrier loci,
spread across chromosomes and likely to be involved in
multiple traits, are required to allow signiﬁcant portions
of the genome to diverge on each side of a consensus
cline (Barton & Hewitt, 1985). Recombination will
Fig. 1 Speciation is a multi-level process unfolding through time and space. Populations are subjected to demographic processes and are
repeatedly redistributed in space. Novel ecological opportunities can arise, and periods of physical separation will alternate with periods of
gene ﬂow. It is quite conceivable that different mechanisms are acting during the different phases of the divergence process. From a
genetic perspective, barrier loci that contribute to reduction in gene ﬂow between diverging genomes may, if conditions are right,
accumulate gradually, extend or combine their effects until the diverging genomes are eventually sealed off from each other and will not
mix any further. Introgression may favour divergence or hybridization may generate new, isolated populations.

break down these associations, whereas selection limits
introgression and maintains them. The strength of
associations is therefore determined by the balance
between the two, quantiﬁed by a coupling coefﬁcient
S/R (Barton, 1983; Baird, 1995; Kruuk et al., 1999), in
which selection (S), is totalled over barrier loci and
recombination (R) is the total map length between
barrier loci. High coupling maintains associations and
consequently a strong barrier in the long term, favouring
independent adaptation despite hybridization. In con-
trast, with low coupling, barrier loci act independently
of one another and are ineffective in keeping popula-
tions isolated (Fig. 2a) (Barton, 1983; Baird, 1995).
Under certain conditions, barriers to gene ﬂow can
be enhanced over time (Navarro & Barton, 2003; Bar-
ton & de Cara, 2009). Clines at endogenous barrier loci
(where selection results from intrinsic incompatibilities)
are not constrained to occur at environmental transi-
tions; they are expected to move towards and coincide
in areas of lower population density (Hewitt, 1975;
Barton, 1979). Clines can also move and become coin-
cident due to asymmetrical ﬁtness of parental geno-
types
(Barton
&
Turelli,
2011).
When
different
endogenous clines meet and overlap, they are expected
to become coupled and then these multiple clines move
together in space. Such moving tension zones will be
trapped by natural barriers to dispersal (Barton, 1979)
or will couple with local adaptation clines that are geo-
graphically stabilized by selection and therefore become
localized (Fig. 2b, Bierne et al., 2011). Spatially coupled
barriers increase the number of loci contributing to S at
their new joint position, which in turn sharpens clines
(Clarke, 1966), increases barrier strength and makes
long-term maintenance of the hybrid zone and of the
differentiation between populations more likely (Bar-
ton, 1983).
The effect of spatial structure in favouring such a
coupling process by generating sufﬁcient linkage dis-
equilibrium to associate unlinked loci when clines over-
lap has been known for some time (Slatkin, 1975;
Endler, 1977; Barton, 1983). Such increases in coupling
may be considered steps towards speciation, as they
lead to increasingly independent evolutionary trajecto-
ries of the taxa on either side of the accumulated bar-
rier. Indeed, spatial coupling is part of a more general
phenomenon which includes the build-up of reproduc-
tive barriers through linkage disequilibrium between
adaptive and assortative mating loci (Felsenstein, 1981).
An analogous process can also operate within a single
panmictic population, though requiring some combina-
tion of strong selection, tight linkage and multiplicative
ﬁtness effects (Barton & de Cara, 2009). A current chal-
lenge is to integrate these ideas with those about the
strengthening of barriers between locally adapted popu-
lations that are an important component of the current
ecological speciation literature (e.g. Via, 2009; Feder
et al., 2012).
Mechanisms that can enhance coupling
From the theory brieﬂy outlined above, one can think
of mechanisms that can catalyse speciation as those that
enhance the coupling of a system: (i) mechanisms that
reduce recombination (R), (ii) mechanisms that maxi-
mize selection at the genome scale (S) and (iii) mecha-
nisms that make clines overlap and prevent their
movements, bringing both endogenous and exogenous
selection together.
(i) Coupling
is
more
efﬁciently
maintained
with
reduced recombination, which can arise due to segregat-
ing inversions (Noor et al., 2001; Navarro & Barton,
2003; Kirkpatrick & Barton, 2006) or other modiﬁers of
recombination (e.g. genomic divergence due to transpos-
able elements that suppress recombination in hybrids;
see below). (ii) Epistasis among barrier loci would lead to
higher S than under additivity; gene expression patterns
in hybrids can be consistent with this type of epistasis

(see below). (iii) Moving clines can be spatially stabilized
by physical barriers to dispersal or by local adaptation.
All these mechanisms can act independently or in con-
cert to build up genetic barriers. It should be emphasized
that the effect of ecologically driven divergent selection
is two-fold: it fuels the populations with divergently
selected barrier loci, and it contributes to anchoring, at
environmental boundaries, clines for barrier loci that do
not interact directly with the environment (endogenous
loci, e.g. Dobzhansky–Muller incompatibilities, assorta-
tive mating genes; Bierne et al., 2011).
Coupling new ecological adaptations with old
intrinsic barriers, an alternative interpretation of
seemingly rapid speciation events
Coupling may play a more important role during rapid
adaptive population subdivision than is appreciated. The
accumulation of intrinsic genetic incompatibilities is
often thought to occur too slowly to explain emblematic
examples of ecological speciation (e.g. recent host shifts
in phytophagous insects or pathogens, Rundle & Nosil,
2005). This is because ecological adaptation has been
shown to evolve on a short timescale, even in the
absence of geographical isolation, despite the compara-
tively long waiting time for mutations that could cause
incompatibilities between populations to accumulate in
appreciable numbers (see Kondrashov, 2003; Gavrilets,
2004). However, coupling theory shows that pre-existing
intrinsic incompatibilities in a tension zone can be
recruited to enhance ecological barriers between popula-
tions (Bierne et al., 2011). This coupling recruitment pro-
cess is different from the usual view of reinforcement of
premating isolation (Barton & de Cara, 2009). Coupling
can build up associations between loci that contribute to
any kind of barrier (pre- or post-zygotic, endogenous or
exogenous), including pre-existing barrier loci segregat-
ing within one of the populations. This could explain the
strikingly deep coalescences often observed at exception-
ally differentiated loci between populations in different
habitats (Schulte et al., 1997; Pogson, 2001; Colosimo
et al., 2005; Wood et al., 2008). Some recent host shifts
in phytophagous insects (corn borer, Malausa et al.,
2005; maggot ﬂy, Michel et al., 2010) might well result
from a new adaptive polymorphism that contributes to
the host shift coming into association and coupling with
incompatibility loci from a cryptic pre-existing tension
zone. If this is the case, then in these systems ecology
should probably not be thought of as the initial catalytic
agent of speciation, but rather a subsequent ingredient
enhancing further build-up of reproductive barriers.
New directions in the study of genetic barriers to
gene ﬂow
Theory demonstrates that it is possible for multiple
barriers to accumulate, or couple, even without spatial
isolation. Yet we do not know, either from theory or
from accumulated empirical data, whether it is a com-
mon evolutionary outcome for reproductive isolation to
be enhanced when incompletely isolated populations
are in contact. It is unclear to what extent initially
divergent
populations
will
become
further
isolated
under conditions of gene ﬂow, stay at the current level
of isolation or become less distinct. Evidently, the likeli-
hood of these alternative outcomes will be shaped by
the ﬂuctuations in geographical and demographic condi-
tions
over
time
because
phylogeographical
history
strongly inﬂuences the nature of the interacting popula-
tions and the circumstances of their contact (Hewitt,
2011). The ﬁnal outcome whereby two species are com-
pletely isolated, in the sense that neutral loci are
expected to diverge, may occur long after genomically
localized divergence was established at multiple, coupled
barrier loci. Since introgression and time can easily erase
the history of populations at most neutral markers
(Grahame et al., 2006; Roberts et al., 2010; Marshall
et al., 2011), the history of incipient speciation should
ideally be reconstructed using data from barrier loci,
accounting for the potential action of selection on these
loci (Williamson et al., 2005). A considerable empirical
challenge is to move from simply identifying such loci
(both endogenous and locally adapted) via analyses of
the patterns of genomic divergence (genome scans), QTL
mapping or genome-wide association studies to deter-
mining sources of selection, measuring their interactions
and inferring their temporal sequence of accumulation.
Although cline theory provides expectations for the
behaviour of a high-dimensional system (populations,
evolutionary processes, genomes, time, space, demogra-
phy, etc., see Fig. 1), it is an ongoing challenge, even
with the relative ease of producing genomic data, to
connect nucleotide variation to phenotypes of indivi-
duals and tie these to the evolutionary dynamics of pop-
ulations. To understand the build-up of a genetic
barrier, one might capitalize on situations in which asso-
ciations between the various components of reproduc-
tive isolation differ. This can be the case between
multiple transects across a single hybrid zone (Szymura
& Barton, 1991; Yanchukov et al., 2006; Nolte et al.,
2009; Teeter et al., 2010) or replicated combinations of
the same lineages at different locations (Riginos & Cunn-
ingham, 2005; Butlin et al., 2008; Simard et al., 2009;
Bernatchez et al., 2010; Hohenlohe et al., 2010; Caputo
et al., 2011). At a larger timescale, the comparison of
barriers among multiple taxa with different divergence
times can provide insights into the sequential accumula-
tion of barrier loci in a genome (Nadeau et al., 2012).
Experimental evolution is an alternative way of studying
the accumulation of barrier loci in a controlled environ-
ment (Dettman et al., 2007). If known, the number and
effects of potential barrier loci and their rates of intro-
gression between populations can provide a basis for
analysis. The physical linkage and statistical associations

among barrier loci in hybrids are also key to understand-
ing the dynamics of further development of isolating
barriers. High-resolution comparative linkage maps for
the divergent populations can indicate whether chromo-
somal rearrangements are likely to play a role. Likewise,
estimates of recombination rates and pairwise associa-
tions between putative barrier loci in hybrids and the
potential for blocks of ancestry and disequilibria to be
retained in hybrids (Baird, 1995) are crucial for under-
standing the dynamics of progress towards speciation.
The theoretical basis of such analyses is best developed
for cline theory, but needs to be extended more fully to
other geographical scenarios (Fitzpatrick et al., 2009)
and to intermittent hybridization.
How often is hybridization a source of
adaptive variation that may contribute to
speciation?
Incomplete barriers to gene ﬂow retard the exchange of
adaptive variation very little. Therefore, one possible
outcome of hybridization may be the introgression of
selectively favoured alleles from one population into
another. This can bring together new adaptive combi-
nations of alleles, which arose in different populations,
in much the same way as sexual reproduction within
populations leads to the production of combinations of
alleles that may provide the basis for adaptive evolu-
tion. In this section, we argue that introgression could
have important implications for the origin of species.
Consider the following:
1 Hybridization among species is reasonably common
on a per-species basis, even though usually very rare
on a per-individual basis. About 10–30% of multicel-
lular animal and plant species hybridize regularly.
Among those that do hybridize, between 1 in 100
and 1 in 10 000 individuals are hybrids when in
sympatry (Mallet, 2005).
2 Mutations are rare, around 108 to 109 per genera-
tion per base pair. Thus, it is likely to take consider-
able
time
for
novel
adaptations
to
evolve
via
mutation
and natural
selection within
a species
(depending on the population size).
3 Hybridization among species can act as an additional,
perhaps more abundant, source of adaptive genetic
variation than mutation (Grant & Grant, 1994; Kim
& Rieseberg, 1999; Arnold & Martin, 2009; Whitney
et al., 2010; Kunte et al., 2011). For example, in
Darwin’s ﬁnches, ‘New additive genetic variance
introduced by hybridization is estimated to be two to
three orders of magnitude greater than that intro-
duced by mutation’ (Grant & Grant, 1994). This pro-
cess is often referred to as ‘adaptive introgression’
(a
somewhat
misleading
term
because,
whereas
hybridization and introgression can lead to adaptive
evolution, the initial hybridization itself is unlikely to
be adaptive and is often selected against).
4 Adaptation is thought to be the most important pro-
cess driving divergence during speciation (Coyne &
Orr, 2004; Sobel et al., 2010; Servedio et al., 2011).
Barriers to gene exchange between species, including
assortative mating, ecological divergence and Dobz-
hansky–Muller incompatibilities, can all be driven by
adaptation. Assortative mating can be a result of
sexual selection, social organization, reinforcement
or a by-product of adaptation to different habitats
(Ritchie, 2007; Seifert, 2010; Sobel et al., 2010).
Divergence
in
ecology
occurs
almost
exclusively
under selection. Recently characterized Dobzhansky–
Muller
incompatibilities
in
Drosophila
have
been
shown to be driven by strong positive selection,
although this may not derive from adaptation to the
external environment (Orr et al., 2004).
5 Closely related species tend to hybridize more often.
In particular, species in rapidly diversifying adaptive
radiations may be particularly prone to hybridization
(Price & Bouvier, 2002; Seehausen, 2004; Gourbie`re
& Mallet, 2010).
Taken together, these points suggest that hybridiza-
tion and introgression, via their role in adaptation, are
likely to contribute to speciation, especially in rapidly
speciating taxa.
The importance of adaptive introgression in specia-
tion will depend on the nature of adaptive variation. In
species with very large populations (e.g. Homo sapiens
and Drosophila melanogaster), every possible DNA substi-
tution may arise even within one generation. However,
not all species have such large populations, and some
classes of adaptive variation may be uncommon even
in large populations. Complex adaptations consisting of
many genetic changes, for example, will be more rarely
encountered than simple mutations. QTL mapping has
shown that adaptive traits often consist of multiple loci,
spread throughout the genome (McKay & Latta, 2002;
Albert et al., 2008). Hybridization has the potential to
introduce large sets of new alleles at multiple unlinked
loci simultaneously, although strong nonadditive selec-
tion may be needed to maintain these sets. Modular,
cassette-like variation (e.g. multiple substitutions in a
single gene or a set of linked coding genes and their
regulatory elements) (Kim et al., 2008), the compo-
nents of which have been tested previously by natural
selection on their original genetic backgrounds, may be
exchanged. In Heliconius, transfer of mimetic patterns
across
species
boundaries
requires
introgression
of
complex alleles at multiple loci (Heliconius Genome
Consortium, 2012), allowing the rapid acquisition of a
genetic architecture that would be difﬁcult to evolve by
sequential accumulation of mutations. Repeated intro-
gression is particularly effective in introducing poly-
genic variation because it will generate multilocus
genotypes that remain in transitory linkage disequilib-
rium,
persisting
for
several
generations
after
each
hybridization event.

A large fraction of introgressed variation is likely to
be deleterious, and many hybridization events may
have no long-term impact. However, when large num-
bers of hybridizations occur among closely related
species, there is more chance that some will contribute
to adaptation and speciation. This is expected to depend
very much on ecological opportunity. The existence of
opportunities for hybrid populations is seemingly dem-
onstrated by the high frequency of speciation events
produced by allopolyploidy in plants (but see below –
Allopolyploid
Speciation).
The
abundant
genotypes
produced by recombination in hybrids should facilitate
further exploration of ecological niches different from
those of the parents.
Hybridization leading to a new taxon, distinct from
both parent species (but with no increase in ploidy),
is variously called homoploid hybrid speciation or recom-
binational speciation (Mallet, 2007; Mavarez & Linarez,
2008; Abbott et al., 2010) (see Fig. 3 and next section).
It is usually argued that this process is rare (Rieseberg,
1997), but promotion of adaptive divergence as a result
of introgression may be much more common and have
the potential to lead to increased reproductive isolation
between populations. Therefore, it is critical that these
processes are separated, both conceptually and empiri-
cally. However, detecting potential adaptive introgres-
sion is difﬁcult. It should become easier with new
genomic techniques which may show that its frequency
has been underestimated in the past. Introgressed genetic
variation can enhance the ability to coexist and promote
invasiveness (Prentis et al., 2008), and thus help to
enlarge the range of a hybrid population substantially.
There is likely to be a positive feedback between hybrid-
ization and speciation (Seehausen, 2004): hybridization
may increase the rate of speciation, and the resulting
diversity of closely related species may then provide
more opportunities for hybridization. Introgression and
hybrid speciation could therefore contribute to the posi-
tive feedback of diversity on diversiﬁcation (Emerson &
Kolm, 2005). Systematic tests which conclusively distin-
guish introgressed alleles from shared polymorphisms
are needed, extending beyond cases where there are ini-
tial phenotypic clues (such as in butterﬂy wing patterns)
and speciﬁcally addressing the role of introgression in
adaptive radiation.
Homoploid hybrid speciation
As mentioned above, one potential outcome of hybrid-
ization and admixture is homoploid hybrid speciation,
which does not involve ploidy changes in the hybrid
(Mallet, 2007; Mavarez & Linarez, 2008; Abbott et al.,
2010). A causative, creative role of hybridization is the
key feature distinguishing hybrid speciation from neu-
tral admixture of multiple parental genomes. Novel
combinations of parental alleles must have contributed
to the establishment and persistence of a new population
that maintains its distinctness by means of reproductive
barriers with both parents. This outcome is what distin-
guishes hybrid speciation from adaptive introgression.
The crucial line of evidence for hybrid speciation is
therefore to identify unique hybrid traits that cause iso-
lating barriers, although extensive genomic admixture
can also be an important indicator of the process. He-
lianthus sunﬂowers are at the highly admixed end of a
continuum where the hybrid genomes comprise major
contributions from both parental taxa and are now iso-
lated from both parents. In contrast, hybrid speciation
in Heliconius butterﬂies involves adaptive introgression
of just one or a few loci that are incorporated into a
divergent genetic background and play a direct role in
barriers to gene ﬂow (Heliconius Genome Consortium,
2012). In both cases, evidence that hybridization has
played a key role was obtained through experimental
re-creation of hybrid phenotypes in the laboratory
(Rieseberg et al., 2003; Mavarez et al., 2006). Whereas
these systems stand out as hallmark examples, the
question arises as to how frequently hybrid speciation
occurs and which genotypic and phenotypic signatures
remain? Mixed ancestry in the genome of a new taxon
is an important signal of hybrid speciation, but it is hard
to distinguish from ancestral polymorphism or contin-
ued gene exchange and alone is not a sufﬁcient crite-
rion. Admixture measures should ideally be combined
with
trait-based
studies
that
connect
admixture
with the origin of reproductive barriers, such as the

selected loci (depicted as black and grey solid lines) in two
populations can be combined by recombinant hybridization. The
resulting hybrid combination can potentially be adaptive and
favoured in a new habitat and can give rise to an independent
hybrid taxon (hybrid speciation), or it can allow one population to
evolve further, replacing the original genome (adaptive
introgression). Globally adaptive variation as well as neutral
variation (both depicted as broken lines) can be exchanged
between all populations via gene ﬂow through hybridization.

identiﬁcation of alleles underlying speciﬁc wing pattern
elements in Heliconius (Salazar et al., 2010).
When comparing examples, it is important to con-
sider the ages of the hybrid taxa and whether they are
proceeding along divergent evolutionary trajectories in
order to separate stages in the process. Analyses of
hybrid swarms or young hybrid taxa can play an
important role in elucidating the ﬁrst steps towards
hybrid species (Nolte & Tautz, 2010). Although such
taxa may not, in the end, give rise to well-differentiated
hybrid species, they can facilitate testing key predictions
from models of hybridization and hybrid speciation
(Buerkle
et al.,
2000; Barton,
2001). For
example,
hybrid populations most likely originate following sec-
ondary contact in newly available habitat (after expan-
sion from refugia or artiﬁcial introduction) but may be
most likely to evolve into hybrid species when a new
ecological space is available that is not utilized by the
parental taxa. Exogenous selection can then maintain
the distinct hybrid taxon even though initial barriers to
gene exchange with the parents are not complete. Case
studies of recently emerged hybrid taxa, such as Cottus
ﬁshes (Stemshorn et al., 2011), Italian sparrows (Passer
italiae; Elgvin et al., 2011; Hermansen et al., 2011),
Appalachian swallowtail butterﬂies (Kunte et al., 2011)
and Oxford ragwort (Senecio; James & Abbott, 2005;
Brennan et al., 2012), show that they remain distinct
even though reproductive barriers are not absolute. In
Oxford ragwort, the hybrid population has colonized a
new environment geographically isolated from those
occupied by its parents whereas, in the other three
cases, reproductive barriers are sufﬁcient for hybrid
taxa to coexist parapatrically (Nolte et al., 2006) or even
sympatrically with parental forms (Hermansen et al.,
2011; Kunte et al., 2011). Nevertheless, additional evi-
dence should be sought for a direct role of hybrid allelic
combinations in barriers to gene ﬂow. Progress in this
direction has been made in the analysis of the very
recent hybrid origin of Lonicera ﬂies (Rhagoletis men-
dax 9 zephyria;
Schwarz
et al.,
2005,
2007),
where
hybrid traits governing host selection have emerged
rapidly and simultaneously caused signiﬁcant reproduc-
tive isolation (allowing the hybrid to persist in sympa-
try with both parents).
There are numerous study systems in which admix-
ture has occurred at some point in the past. Examples
include radiations of ﬁshes such as crater lake cichlids
(Schliewen & Klee, 2004), sharpﬁn silversides (Herder
et al., 2006) and the postglacial radiation of whiteﬁshes
(Bernatchez, 2004; Hudson et al., 2011). Convincing
evidence for ancient admixture has been found in all of
these systems, but further evidence is needed for a
direct role of hybridization in creating reproductively
isolated
populations
or
accelerating
diversiﬁcation.
Fixed genomic blocks derived from different parental
populations can indicate a hybrid genetic architecture
that has evolved because it confers a ﬁtness advantage
and creates a reproductive barrier (Fig. 3). Great poten-
tial for future studies lies in analyses of the structure of
hybrid genomes, particularly the size and distribution
of blocks derived from alternative ancestors (Barton,
1983; Baird, 1995). However, ﬁxation of blocks from
different parents will also occur through genetic drift
(Ungerer et al., 1998; Buerkle & Rieseberg, 2008), and
this scenario must be excluded before evidence for
hybrid speciation is accepted. Although modelling of
the
decay
of
linkage
disequilibrium
in
admixed
genomes (Pool & Nielsen, 2009) and the ﬁxation of
ancestral blocks (Buerkle & Rieseberg, 2008) have been
employed to study hybrid speciation, such methods
have yet to be applied to a wide range of hybrid taxa,
and further development of these methods is critical.
Inferring the evolutionary signiﬁcance of hybrid genetic
architecture in speciation may become more problem-
atic the further back in time the event lies because drift
and selection become harder to distinguish.
Together with the age of the hybrid species itself, the
level
of
divergence
between
the
parental
taxa
is
another important consideration for homoploid hybrid
speciation studies (as it is for allopolyploid speciation:
Paun et al., 2009; Buggs et al., 2009). When divergence
is low, there may be little chance of major novelties
arising in hybrids but, when divergence is high, intrin-
sic incompatibility may prevent successful hybridiza-
tion. Crossing experiments with cichlid ﬁsh provide
support for more divergent populations being more
likely to generate novel trait combinations (Stelkens &
Seehausen, 2009). Thus, an important challenge in
studies of hybrid speciation is to ask whether there is
an ‘optimal’ genetic distance for homoploid hybrid
speciation (Arnold et al., 1999; Gross, 2012).
Allopolyploid speciation
Polyploidy, which results in species containing three or
more homologous chromosome sets rather than the
two in their diploid ancestors, is an important mecha-
nism in hybrid speciation because it creates a strong,
though often incomplete, postzygotic reproductive bar-
rier between a hybrid and its parents. While common
in only some animals (Mable et al., 2011), polyploidy is
of major signiﬁcance in plant evolution with the latest
estimates indicating that all extant ﬂowering plants
have polyploidy in their ancestry (Jiao et al., 2011),
whereas 15% of angiosperm and 31% of fern specia-
tion events directly involve polyploidy (Wood et al.,
2009). Two types of polyploids are normally recognized:
autopolyploids in which chromosome sets are derived
from the same species and allopolyploids that contain
chromosome sets from different species as a consequence
of interspeciﬁc hybridization. This classiﬁcation is over-
simplistic (Stebbins, 1971), as it draws a somewhat
arbitrary division through a continuum of degrees of
divergence between parents involved in crossing and

polyploid formation. Allopolyploidy is considered to be
more common in nature than autopolyploidy (Coyne &
Orr, 2004; although see Soltis et al., 2007), but despite
its obvious importance, much remains unknown about
the process and its consequences (Soltis et al., 2010).
This is particularly true with regard to the establish-
ment of allopolyploid species in the wild.
Well-established allopolyploid species often occur in
habitats where their diploid relatives are not found
(Brochmann et al., 2004; Paun et al., 2011). It is feasi-
ble, therefore, that ecological divergence is an impor-
tant driver of allopolyploid establishment, enabling a
new allopolyploid species to escape the minority-type
disadvantage resulting from intermating with a parent
(Levin, 1975), additional negative effects of interploidal
gene ﬂow (Chapman & Abbott, 2010) and possible
competitive disadvantages in parental habitats. Deter-
mining the role of hybridization per se vs. subsequent
ecological selection on the hybrid genotype is important
for understanding the relative importance of hybridiza-
tion vs. selection in the establishment of allopolyploids,
as it is for homoploid hybrid populations (see above).
Allopolyploids
are
often
geographically
widespread,
occupying open habitats created by climatic, human or
other disturbances (Stebbins, 1984; Brochmann et al.,
2004).
They
frequently
exhibit
greater
vigour
and
homoeostatic buffering relative to their diploid rela-
tives, making them well suited for colonizing new habi-
tats (Grant, 1981). There are several mechanisms, such
as ﬁxed heterozygosity, that may explain the advanta-
ges allopolyploids display under such conditions (Levin,
2002; Hegarty & Hiscock, 2007).
The recent ﬁnding that many newly formed allopo-
lyploids exhibit considerable genomic and transcriptom-
ic variation relative to their parents (Doyle et al., 2008;
Hegarty & Hiscock, 2008) opens the way to examine
possible links between the nature of such variation,
ecological divergence and speciation (Parisod, 2012).
Paun et al. (2011) recently used cDNA-ampliﬁed frag-
ment length polymorphism (cDNA-AFLP) to examine
gene expression differences between two diploid orchid
(Dactylorhiza) species and three derivative allotetraploids
that differed markedly in ecology, geography and mor-
phology from each other. Certain transcriptomic differ-
ences between the ﬁve species were correlated with
particular eco-climatic variables, suggesting they could
be adaptive. Going beyond association, it will be neces-
sary to demonstrate a direct link between regulatory
networks affected by alterations to gene expression and
ecological divergence to show that such differences are
adaptive. Moreover, it will be necessary to distinguish
between the impacts of changes occurring at the time
of origin of an allopolyploid and during subsequent
evolution on both adaptation and reproductive isolation
(Ramsey & Schemske, 2002).
Despite the likely importance of ecological divergence
in allopolyploid speciation, there is surprisingly no direct
evidence that it originates at the time of origin of an
allopolyploid species. This contrasts with the position for
homoploid hybrid speciation (Gross & Rieseberg, 2005;
Abbott et al., 2010). In seeking experimental evidence
to determine whether ecological divergence accompa-
nies or follows allopolyploid speciation, we could focus
on the few species known to have originated within the
last 100 years or so (Abbott & Lowe, 2004), particularly
those that can be resynthesized artiﬁcially [e.g. Senecio
cambrensis, Tragopogon mirus and T. miscellus (Hegarty
et al., 2005; Tate et al., 2009)]. Synthetics of each of
these species exhibit considerable genomic and tran-
scriptomic variation relative to their parents, providing a
source of novelty on which selection could act (Hegarty
et al., 2008; Buggs et al., 2011). Comparisons of ﬁtness
between synthetics and parental types transplanted into
sites occupied by the wild form of allopolyploid would
be one approach to test whether ecological divergence
accompanied the origin of these neo-allopolyploids.
It has been suggested that over the longer term,
polyploidy may set the stage for rapid diversiﬁcation,
perhaps even explaining the ‘abominable mystery’ of
the origins of angiosperm diversity (De Bodt et al.,
2005). Evidence for multiple ancient polyploidization
events in the genomes of plants whose chromosomes
appear to be diploid seems to favour this view (Blanc
et al., 2003; Jiao et al., 2011), as does the frequency of
polyploidy in island radiations (Murray & de Lange,
2011) and the theoretical expectation that gene dupli-
cation provides raw material for evolution (Lynch &
Conery, 2000). However, this view is contradicted by
apparently lower diversiﬁcation rates of polyploids com-
pared to their diploid relatives within genera (Mayrose
et al., 2011), and the predictive success of models in
which polyploidization is a neutral, one-way process
(Meyers & Levin, 2006; Mayrose et al., 2011). The role
of allopolyploidy as a driver of plant diversiﬁcation thus
remains an open question. In neo-allopolyploids, multi-
ple origins are common (Soltis & Soltis, 1993), forming
independent lineages that might merge to generate
polyploid populations with high genetic diversity (Soltis
& Soltis, 2000; Holloway et al., 2006) or follow inde-
pendent evolutionary trajectories leading to separate
species (Werth & Windham, 1991). The latter has not
yet been demonstrated in natural species (Soltis & Sol-
tis, 2009), but patterns of chromosomal change found
in independent lineages of the recent allopolyploid Tra-
gopogon miscellus may create incompatibilities that pro-
mote speciation (Lim et al., 2008; Chester et al., 2012).
Diverse genetic mechanisms underlie

outcomes, as discussed above, but what are the genetic

are generally treated as qualitatively different phenom-
ena (e.g. ‘incompatibilities’ vs. ‘evolutionary novelty’).
However, both describe the appearance of potentially
ﬁtness-related phenotypic traits in hybrids that lie out-
side the parental distributions, be it in fecundity, physi-
ology, morphology or behaviour. The very same genetic
mechanisms can underlie novel transgressive pheno-
types whether their ﬁtness effects are positive or nega-
tive: in both cases, they are due to the creation of
genetic combinations that have not been tested by
selection in the parental populations. Determining the
mechanisms that cause these phenotypes to appear will
aid understanding of the impact of hybridization on the
speciation process.
Two classes of mechanism might be considered. First,
alleles of additive effect may not all be ﬁxed in the
same direction between diverging populations, espe-
cially if selection is weak (Orr, 1998). Some hybrid
genotypes then fall outside the parental distribution
(+++ x + can generate ++++ or ). Second,
new phenotypes may result from interactions (domi-
nance or epistasis) between alleles ﬁxed independently
in different populations. Dobzhansky–Muller incompati-
bilities, where these interactions have negative conse-
quences, have dominated research on the genetics of
speciation, and the focus has tended to be on simple
two-locus incompatibilities mediated through protein–
protein interactions. In fact, both classes of mechanism
can be interpreted much more broadly, and the last
decade of research has started to reveal a wider variety
of genetic mechanisms underlying novel hybrid pheno-
types,
including
genome
restructuring,
duplication/
deletion (Oka’s model, see e.g. Nei & Nozawa, 2011),
alterations in the timing and levels of gene expression,
epigenetic effects and transposon activation (Landry
et al., 2007; Doyle et al., 2008; Masly et al., 2006;
Michalak, 2009; references in Ainouche & Jenczewski,
2010). Dissecting these mechanisms will help to under-
stand
why
hybridization
sometimes
generates
new
adaptive phenotypes, how incompatibilities accumulate
over time and whether incompatibilities are likely to
break down or not when exposed to gene ﬂow and
recombination.
The proximate causes of extensive phenotypic nov-
elty in hybrids lie in differences between the contribut-
ing genomes that, when combined, have novel effects.
Divergence in the regulatory architecture of genes may
be particularly likely to produce correlated, genome-
wide responses to hybridization and may occur quickly
following isolation. The extent of novel expression pat-
terns in the ﬁrst few generations following hybridiza-
tion often exceed what can be expected from simple
reshufﬂing of pairwise epistatic interactions (Ranz et al.,
2004). In particular, regulatory genes are fast-evolving
(Castillo-Davis et al., 2004) and evolve in a compensatory
fashion within complex networks, increasing the proba-
bility of epistatic effects after hybridization (Johnson &
Porter, 2000; Birchler & Veitia, 2010) and leading to
one-to-many or many-to-many interactions rather than
the classic one-to-one Dobzhansky–Muller incompati-
bilities. Structural variation between species, including
chromosomal organization, gene duplication or loss and
transposable element distribution, can also produce
substantial
phenotypic
effects
and
directly
impact
recombination rate and reproductive compatibility with
parental
species
(Rieseberg,
2001;
Nei
&
Nozawa,
2011). Differences in genome structure may induce
further restructuring (with possible phenotypic conse-
quences) after recombination of the hybrid genomes
(Gaeta & Pires, 2010).
Divergence in transposable element complements can
occur rapidly and can have profound consequences fol-
lowing
hybridization.
The
merging
of
divergent
genomes in F1 hybrids may result in quantitative or
qualitative mismatches between interspersed transpos-
able elements and their maternally transmitted siRNA
repressors (Comai et al., 2003; Bourc’his & Voinnet,
2010). Such miss-regulation can induce the activation
of speciﬁc transposable elements and promote both
restructuring and epigenetic re-patterning throughout
the hybrid genome (Parisod et al., 2010). Although
massive mobilization of transposable elements inducing
mutation bursts may lead to low hybrid ﬁtness in
extreme cases (e.g. hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila;
Blumenstiel & Hartl, 2005), more limited reactivation
may promote moderate transposition and result in
structural polymorphism that suppresses recombination
at homologous loci (e.g. recombinationally inert haplo-
types in maize; He & Dooner, 2009). Activation of
transposable elements induced by hybridization may
thus play a pivotal role during speciation by triggering
genome-wide variation in functional genes (e.g. stably
altering expression through sequence disruption or epi-
genetic changes in the vicinity of insertion sites; Hollis-
ter et al., 2011) or strongly modifying recombination
patterns
across
the
genome,
with
potential
conse-
quences for barriers to gene ﬂow (Ungerer et al., 2006).
These various genetic mechanisms underlying trans-
gressive hybrid phenotypes differ in a number of attri-
butes that may have important implications for the
evolutionary
dynamics
of
populations
produced
through hybridization. Miss-regulation of gene expres-
sion may be expected to produce new phenotypes
immediately
upon
genome
merging,
perhaps
more
readily than protein–protein interactions, with further
variants emerging over time as recombination produces
novel combinations of interacting genetic elements.
Accordingly, the emergence of novel variation is likely
to be an ongoing process, with different phenotypes
being
exposed to natural
selection over successive
generations. Moreover, the mechanisms that change
genome
structure
and

ways to the evolutionary dynamics of hybridization.
Structural changes are expected to contribute primarily
to barriers to gene ﬂow, as chromosomal restructuring
that restores reproductive function within the hybrid
population also likely induces incompatibility with the
parental forms (as in allopolyploidy). In contrast, func-
tional changes can have a wide array of effects on
every aspect of the phenotype, playing some role in
barriers if they reduce ﬁtness (Ortiz-Barrientos et al.,
2007)
and
being
important
in
generating
ﬁtness-
enhancing evolutionary novelty (Ni et al., 2008; Edelist
et al., 2009), a critical prerequisite for ecological differ-
entiation and competitive success in incipient hybrid
species. Whether there is a predictable shift from ﬁtness
enhancement to ﬁtness reduction with increasing diver-
gence between interacting species, as regulatory net-
work differences, transposable elements, etc. begin to
exceed the limits of complementarity or rapid recovery
in hybrids, is an open question that could proﬁtably be
addressed
with
experimental
systems
or
controlled
studies within particular groups. A better understanding
of the mechanisms contributing to hybrid phenotypes
may help to resolve some areas of disagreement over
the role of hybridization in the speciation process. If
gene miss-regulation is indeed a common source of
incompatibilities, as is suggested both by classic stud-
ies of hybrid unﬁtness (Wittbrodt et al., 1989) and by
more recent work in yeast and Drosophila (Anderson
et al., 2010; Araripe et al., 2010; Kao et al., 2010), a net-
work-based modelling approach that can accommodate
the complex patterns of epistasis typical of regulatory
networks may perform signiﬁcantly better than two-
locus
models
in
predicting
evolutionary
outcomes
(e.g. Porter & Johnson, 2002; Palmer & Feldman, 2009;
see sections Hybridization and the Development of
Genetic Barriers to Gene Flow and Homoploid Hybrid
Speciation).
At the molecular level, we still know relatively little
about how these mechanisms work outside of model
organisms. Gaining insights into the nature of the mul-
tiple
genetic
elements
involved
in
speciation
and
hybridization, and including more precise analysis of
molecular aspects of phenotypic evolution, is an impor-
tant task that will substantially increase our ability to
identify what is occurring when divergent genomes
interact. This is becoming more tractable in nonmodel
organisms, with the rapid advances in next-generation
sequencing
technologies
(e.g.
Wolf
et al.,
2010b).
Finally, although we are beginning to appreciate the
impact of genome changes on phenotypic variation,
linking this
to ﬁtness remains
a
critical
challenge
(Barrett & Hoekstra, 2011). The hypothesis that particu-
lar
genetic
mechanisms
inﬂuence
the
outcome
of
hybridization via their effect on phenotypes has been
tested rigorously in very few systems (e.g. Edelist
et al., 2009; Tirosh et al., 2009; Groszmann et al., 2011;
Arnold et al., 2012). Experimental approaches would be
particularly valuable in integrating laboratory results
with natural hybridization events.
Consequences of reinforcement
In the sections above, the emphasis has been on
hybridization’s direct effects on speciation. Hybridiza-
tion can give rise to new recombinant populations that
become divergent enough from other populations to
form new species. Alternatively, hybridization may
either break down existing barriers or favour the evolu-
tion of stronger barriers to gene exchange that might
ultimately ﬁnalize speciation. Yet, as we describe below,
hybridization can play an additional, indirect role in spe-
ciation, by setting the stage for new speciation events.
Given selection against unﬁt hybrids, traits that gen-
erate enhanced prezygotic isolation could evolve where
populations are in contact (i.e. reinforcement may
occur;
Dobzhansky,
1940).
Although
extensively
debated and often controversial, recent theoretical and
empirical work indicates that reinforcement can gener-
ate increased prezygotic isolation (Servedio & Noor,
2003; Coyne & Orr, 2004), but may not complete speci-
ation (e.g. Bı´mova´ et al., 2011). Continued work is still
needed to assess its overall contribution to speciation,
its frequency and when it is likely to result in complete
isolation. Here, we evaluate possible indirect conse-
quences of reinforcement. Reinforcement may result in
divergence between populations inside and outside
zones of contact with an interacting taxon, leading to
three possible outcomes.
First, consider two incompletely isolated taxa, A
and B, with partial range overlap. Because hybrids have
reduced ﬁtness, reinforcement may lead to divergence
between A and B in the region of overlap. The extent
of divergence between A and B will depend in part on
gene ﬂow into the region of overlap (sympatry) from
populations outside the area of overlap (allopatry),
where
mating
traits
are
under
different
selection
pressures. At the same time, gene ﬂow out from the
overlap populations may cause divergent phenotypes to
spread into the regions of each taxon where they do
not overlap. The balance between these effects can pro-
duce an inverse cline (Antonovics, 2006 and references
therein; Bı´mova´ et al., 2011). Simple models suggest
that the leakage of traits that evolve within the hybrid
zones into allopatric populations will only be local
(Caisse & Antonovics, 1978; Sanderson, 1989) unless
driven by an additional form of selection. Reinforce-
ment within the hybrid zone might stall, rather than
increase further, if the build-up of linkage disequilib-
rium is counteracted by gene ﬂow or recombination
from nonselected individuals outside the zone (e.g.
Bı´mova´ et al., 2011; see reviews by Servedio & Noor,
2003; Coyne & Orr, 2004). Consequently, the degree
to
which
reinforcement
drives
divergence
between
populations inside and outside the hybrid zone within

Hybridization and speciation

taxon A or B depends on (i) the extent to which rein-
forcement drives divergence between A and B in the
ﬁrst place within the area of overlap, (ii) the extent of
gene ﬂow from overlap populations into the remainder
of the distributions of A and B and (iii) other selection
pressures operating on traits that inﬂuence assortment.
The balance of these factors may mean that reinforce-
ment results in little or no divergence between the
taxa, or among populations within the taxa.
If gene ﬂow within taxon A (or B) is limited, for
example in a patchy environment, a second outcome of
reinforcement may be the evolution of reproductive
traits in overlap populations that are so divergent from
those outside the area of contact that individuals with
the alternative trait types are less likely to reproduce
(Howard,
1993;
see
also
reviews,
discussion,
and
references therein by Pfennig & Pfennig, 2009, 2010;
Ortiz-Barrientos et al., 2009; Hoskin & Higgie, 2010).
Consequently, this can lead to the initiation of repro-
ductive isolation between sympatric and allopatric popu-
lations of taxon A (or B), which can ultimately lead to
speciation (Howard, 1993; Pfennig & Pfennig, 2009,
2010; Ortiz-Barrientos et al., 2009; Hoskin & Higgie,
2010; for theoretical treatments see Pfennig & Ryan,
2006; McPeek & Gavrilets, 2006). For example, Jaenike
et al. (2006) showed that, between two sympatric spe-
cies of Drosophila, strong hybrid inviability not only
selected for discrimination against heterospeciﬁcs but
also, as a side product, led to discrimination against
conspeciﬁcs
from
allopatric
populations.
Similarly,
Svensson et al. (2006) found that strong divergent sex-
ual selection was accompanied by a signiﬁcant decrease
in female matings with conspeciﬁcs from other popula-
tions. Trade-offs in ﬁtness between assortative mating
and sexual selection within populations may enhance
the divergence between populations (e.g. Pfennig &
Pfennig, 2005; for further discussion, see Pfennig &
Pfennig,
2009,
2010;
Ortiz-Barrientos
et al.,
2009;
Hoskin
&
Higgie,
2010).
These
trade-offs
may
be
emphasized when a stepwise change in environmental
conditions coincides with the boundary of the region of
range overlap. Other factors that favour reinforcement
in the ﬁrst place (e.g. strong selection, linkage between
ﬁtness and mating traits) may also foster divergence
between overlap and allopatric populations, underscor-
ing the potential for reinforcement-mediated speciation
to be autocatalytic in nature.
A third possibility occurs where taxa A and B have
multiple independent areas of overlap. If traits evolve
differently in response to a given heterospeciﬁc among
geographically distinct overlap populations, or if a given
species encounters and undergoes reinforcement differ-
ently with several distinct species across its range, such
conspeciﬁc
populations
may
become
reproductively
isolated from one another (Howard, 1993; Pfennig &
Pfennig, 2009; Hoskin & Higgie, 2010; e.g. Hoskin et al.,
2005; Lemmon, 2009). Such diversity in the outcome
of reinforcement is especially likely when reinforce-
ment may operate on a multitude of traits (McPeek &
Gavrilets,
2006;
Pfennig
&
Ryan,
2006;
Lemmon,
2009). As an example of the former scenario, Hoskin
et al. (2005) found that premating isolation between
two
different
populations
of
rainforest
tree
frogs
resulted from unequal divergence in mate preferences
in their separate contact zones with an alternative tree
frog population.
Evaluating these possibilities is both an empirical and
a theoretical challenge. How often do the relevant cir-
cumstances arise that lead to these outcomes? How
likely are the various types of divergence to persist in
the face of gene ﬂow and thereby ultimately result in
new species? How likely is gene ﬂow between overlap
and nonoverlap regions, particularly where they are
ecologically distinct? To answer these questions, com-
parisons of reproductive traits are needed among popu-
lations as well as between taxa. Of particular value are
data that: (i) identify the reproductive traits and trait
values that are differentially favoured within and out-
side the range overlap; (ii) measure ﬁtness conse-
quences of trait variation in both regions to identify
sources of selective trade-offs, if any; (iii) evaluate
whether trait divergence impacts reproductive success
and (iv) determine whether increased genetic differen-
tiation has evolved between regions, independent of
the direct effects of hybridization (for a similar set of
criteria, see Hoskin & Higgie, 2010). Regarding the last
goal, it is important to note that divergence may some-
times be detected using neutral markers (e.g. Svensson
et al., 2004; Rice & Pfennig, 2010), but not always (e.g.
Hoskin et al., 2005; Jaenike et al., 2006; Thibert-Plante
& Hendry, 2009; see also Hoskin & Higgie, 2010). In
addition to empirical studies, theoretical work would be
useful for addressing these issues. Finally, future work
should incorporate an explicit consideration of other
sources of divergent selection that could drive similar
patterns and therefore be mistaken for population
divergence that arises indirectly from reinforcement
(sensu Rundle & Schluter, 1998; see also Coyne & Orr,
2004; Pfennig & Pfennig, 2009; cf. Hoskin & Higgie,
2010). For example, ecological factors (e.g. resource
competition, abiotic conditions) differing between over-
lap and nonoverlap regions may be as important for
population differentiation as selection driven by hybrid-
ization avoidance (e.g. Etges et al., 2009; see also Price,
1998; Coyne & Orr, 2004; Rundle & Nosil, 2005; Price,
2008; Sobel et al., 2010; Pfennig & Pfennig, 2010;
Hoskin & Higgie, 2010 and references therein).
The ideas above are not new (see, for example,
Howard, 1993; Price, 1998; and references above), but
they have received relatively little investigation, possi-
bly because attention has focused on the process of
reinforcement itself. Our goal here is to highlight the
need
to
extend
consideration
of
reinforcement
to
include its consequences. Moreover, this discussion

reﬂects one of our original points: that hybridization
between two populations typically occurs in a complex
spatial and temporal context. The outcomes of interac-
tions in different parts of the range of a species may
vary, depending on both the environmental and the
genetic conditions locally. This creates divergence but
the net effect is hard to predict: hybridization may
accelerate diversiﬁcation, as described above for both
the case of reinforcement and the case of adaptive
introgression, but it need not. More empirical evidence
is required.
Concluding remarks
Historically, hybridization has been viewed primarily
as a countervailing process to speciation. Secondary
contact zones with extensive gene ﬂow may remain
stable for thousands of generations, and much of the
genome of the interacting species may become mixed.
Nevertheless, variation distinguishing the populations
is
usually maintained
and may be built upon
or
recruited through coupling with other barriers to gene
ﬂow. This may also set the scene for reinforcement,
and barriers to gene exchange may become stronger
and more widespread genomically. Alternatively, pop-
ulations may fuse. As highlighted above, the factors
determining these different outcomes remain poorly
understood. Hybridization can also play a more diverse
role in promoting speciation. It may provide the raw
material for adaptive divergence or initiate new hybrid
populations, potentially leading to speciation. Again,
the impact of factors such as existing levels of diver-
gence and ecological opportunity on these outcomes
requires further study. Both reinforcement and hybrid
speciation may generate positive feedback that accel-
erates
diversiﬁcation.
The
genomic
signatures
of
hybridization and introgression will be investigated
(theoretically and empirically) more fully now that the
incidence of hybridization during speciation is better
appreciated. However, it is striking that, after so much
study, we are still poorly equipped to tackle a funda-
mental problem such as how to estimate the propor-
tion
of
hybridization
events
that
have
led
to
speciation,
and
we
cannot
yet
predict
whether
a
hybridization event will be favourable to speciation or
not. In the mid-20th century, Edgar Anderson was the
greatest proponent of the importance of hybridization
in evolution (Anderson, 1949; Anderson & Stebbins,
1954), which led to light-hearted ridicule by some col-
leagues. As Warren H. Wagner (relayed by Michael
Arnold, pers. comm.) once said, ‘We used to make fun
of Edgar Anderson by saying that he was ﬁnding
hybrids under every bush. Then we realized that even
the bushes were hybrids’. With genomic tools, we are
beginning to understand that the evolutionary impor-
tance of hybridization may even exceed Anderson’s
expectation.
