Summary 
1 
1. Once neglected, the role of facilitative interactions in plant communities has 
2 
received considerable attention in the last two decades, and is now widely 
3 
recognised. It is timely to consider the progress made by research in this field. 
4 
2. We review the development of plant facilitation research, focussing on the 
5 
history of the field, the relationship between plant-plant interactions and 
6 
environmental severity gradients, and attempts to integrate facilitation into 
7 
mainstream ecological theory. We then consider future directions for 
8 
facilitation research. 
9 
3. With respect to our fundamental understanding of plant facilitation, 
10 
clarification of the relationship between interactions and environmental 
11 
gradients is central for further progress, and necessitates the design and 
12 
implementation of more complex experiments than generally undertaken to 
13 
date. 
14 
4. There is substantial scope for exploring indirect facilitative effects in plant 
15 
communities, including their impacts on diversity and evolution, and future 
16 
studies should attempt to connect the degree of non-transitivity in plant 
17 
competitive networks to community diversity and facilitative promotion of 
18 
species co-existence, and explore how the role of indirect facilitation varies 
19 
along environmental gradients.  
20 
5. Certain ecological modelling approaches (e.g. individual-based modelling), 
21 
although thus far largely neglected, provide highly useful tools for exploring 
22 
these fundamental processes. 
23 
6. We consider the links between plant facilitation and evolution. Unusual 
24 
evolutionary responses might result from facilitative interactions in plant 
25

----- Page 5 (native) -----
4
communities, and consideration of facilitation might lead to re-assessment of 
1 
the evolution of plant growth forms.  
2 
7. Improved understanding of facilitation processes has direct relevance for  the 
3 
development of tools for ecosystem restoration, and for improving our 
4 
understanding of the response of plant species and communities to key 
5 
environmental change drivers.  
6 
8. Attempts to apply of our developing ecological knowledge would benefit from 
7 
explicit recognition of the potential role of facilitative plant-plant interactions 
8 
in the design and interpretation of studies from the fields of restoration and 
9 
global change ecology. 
10 
9. Despite the undoubted progress made in this field in the last 20 years 
11 
considerable research challenges still exist. Tackling these challenges will not 
12 
only advance the field of plant facilitation research, but also community 
13 
ecology in general.

Introduction 
19 
Plants interact in many different ways, both negative and positive. They compete for 
20 
light, nutrients, space, pollinators, and water, but at the same time protect one another 
21 
from the impacts of herbivores, potential competitors, or extremes of climate, and 
22 
provide additional resources through canopy leaching, microbial enhancement, 
23 
mycorrhizal networks and hydraulic lift.  
24

There has been a particular resurgence of interest in the positive, non-trophic 
1 
interactions that occur between physiologically independent plants, and that are 
2 
mediated through changes in the abiotic environment or through other organisms - 
3 
both plant and animal (for reviews see Hunter & Aarssen 1988; Callaway 1995; 
4 
Flores & Jurado 2003; Bruno et al. 2003).  Substantial recent research has examined 
5 
such interactions, exploring in detail the mechanisms by which they take place 
6 
(Holzapfel & Mahall 1999; Maestre et al. 2003a), the way in which they control the 
7 
structure and function of communities (Tirado & Pugnaire 2003; Kikvidze et al. 
8 
2005), and their implications for classic ecological theory (Bruno et al. 2003, Lortie et 
9 
al. 2004a). Furthermore, plant facilitation research is starting to make links to some of 
10 
the most important current ecological issues including the relationship between 
11 
biodiversity and ecosystem function, and the impacts of global change  (Hooper et al. 
12 
2005; Brooker 2006).  
13 
 
14 
It is perhaps a suitable time for reviewing the progress made in this field. Has the 
15 
recent research effort taken this field forward? Given our current understanding, what 
16 
gaps in our knowledge of facilitative interactions most urgently need to be addressed? 
17 
Do we know enough about them to understand their role in mediating the impact of 
18 
environmental change drivers or to use this knowledge to mitigate such impacts?  This 
19 
paper will attempt to answer these questions. Firstly we discuss recent key 
20 
developments in facilitation research. We then suggest areas where we consider that 
21 
there are  opportunities for future research, and the approaches that might be used to 
22 
take this work forward. We focus our review in particular on interactions between 
23 
vascular plants, as they have been the focus of the bulk of plant facilitation studies.

Recent developments in plant facilitation research 
1 
 “History will be kind to me, for I intend to write it” – Winston Churchill 
2 
 
3 
Until recently many ecologists only encountered facilitative plant-plant interactions 
4 
within a particular context: facilitation of one successional stage by the preceding 
5 
stage was a recognised, albeit underestimated, component of some theories of 
6 
succession (Clements 1916; Connell & Slatyer 1977) and had been demonstrated in a 
7 
number of ecosystems, for example in the classic studies of plant succession in 
8 
Glacier Bay (Crocker & Major 1955; Chapin et al. 1994).  
9 
 
10 
However, in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s a number of review papers (e.g. 
11 
Hunter & Aarssen 1988; Bertness & Callaway 1994; Callaway 1995, 1997; Brooker 
12 
& Callaghan 1998) pointed out that facilitative plant interactions also operated to 
13 
regulate plant success and community composition in stable, non-successional 
14 
communities, and were not merely important during successional change. Although 
15 
some of these reviews (e.g. Hunter & Aarssen 1988) considered relatively well-
16 
recognised types of positive interactions, e.g. the attraction of pollinators (Thomson 
17 
1978), the positive impact of shrub species on soil nitrogen availability (García-Moya 
18 
& McKell 1970), the capacity for resource sharing through common mycorrhizal 
19 
networks (Chiarello et al. 1982), and classic nurse plant effects (Went 1942; Fig. 1), 
20 
they also discussed a developing body of research examining non-trophic interactions 
21 
between neighbouring plants that either did not fit into these well-recognised 
22 
categories, or that demonstrated that some facilitative effects (e.g. the nurse plant 
23 
effect) were more widespread than was previously thought. From these reviews some 
24 
common themes emerged: 
25

----- Page 8 (native) -----
7
 
1 
1. Evidence of facilitative effects between plants tended to come from severe 
2 
environments, such as deserts, arctic or alpine tundra systems, or salt marshes. It 
3 
was even proposed that the concentration of ecological research in temperate 
4 
ecosystems (which were readily accessible and easily studied by many ecologists) 
5 
might have added to the neglect of facilitation within plant ecology (Brooker & 
6 
Callaghan 1998), or that “fascination with competition has focused attention on 
7 
communities where competition is conspicuous” (Bertness & Callaway 1994).  
8 
 
9 
2. The net interaction between plants resulted from multiple positive and negative 
10 
interactions (Hunter & Aarssen 1988). For example, plants that competed for 
11 
nutrients could have simultaneous positive effects through the provision of shelter 
12 
or protection from herbivory.   
13 
 
14 
3. The severity of the environment was linked to the balance between positive and 
15 
negative interactions. Increased environmental severity increased either the 
16 
potential for or strength of positive relative to negative interactions, and 
17 
consequently the observable net interactions between neighbouring plants shifted 
18 
toward facilitation in extreme environments (Hunter & Aarssen 1988; Bertness & 
19 
Callaway 1994; Callaway & Walker 1997; Brooker & Callaghan 1998). 
20 
 
21 
These reviews coincided with, and probably contributed to, further increases in 
22 
interest in the mechanisms and impact of facilitative plant-plant interactions. As well 
23 
as dealing with “the mistaken notion that positive interactions are not well 
24 
demonstrated with field experiments” (Callaway 1995) - although competition still 
25

----- Page 9 (native) -----
8
clearly dominates consideration of plant-plant interactions within the ecological 
1 
literature (Fig. 2) - recent studies have explored in detail the issues raised by these 
2 
reviews. Two topics in particular have received considerable attention, firstly the 
3 
relationship between plant-plant interactions and environmental severity gradients, 
4 
and secondly linking facilitative plant-plant interactions into mainstream ecological 
5 
theory. Because these issues are central to plant facilitation research we now review 
6 
them in more detail.

GRADIENTS 
10 
Although Hunter & Aarssen (1988) discussed the balance between positive and 
11 
negative plant-plant interactions, they did not suggest any generic relationships 
12 
between this balance and environmental gradients. Bertness & Callaway’s (1994) 
13 
paper was central to recent developments in plant facilitation research in that it took 
14 
such a step, proposing that increases in either the degree of physical stress or 
15 
consumer pressure would increase the frequency of positive interactions, as under 
16 
these conditions the potential for such interactions would increase. Callaway & 
17 
Walker (1997) discussed the possible regulatory effects of climatic conditions and life 
18 
history stage (see also Callaway 1995) on the balance between positive and negative 
19 
interactions. Brooker & Callaghan (1998) explicitly framed their model within the 
20 
context of Grime’s (1974, 1977, 1979) definitions of stress and disturbance, 
21 
concentrating on changes in interactions along gradients of disturbance because of 
22 
unresolved debate concerning the relationship between competitive interactions and 
23 
gradients of stress (Tilman 1988; Grace 1991, 1993; Reader et al. 1994; Brooker et al. 
24

----- Page 10 (native) -----
9
2005). However, Brooker & Callaghan’s (1998) approach was not without criticism 
1 
(Bertness 1998).  
2 
 
3 
Overall, an amalgam of these models has become known as the stress gradient 
4 
hypothesis or SGH - something of a misnomer considering that the original model of 
5 
Bertness & Callaway (1994), to which current studies tend to refer, included both 
6 
stress and consumer pressure. Recently a large number of studies have attempted to 
7 
test the predictions of the SGH. Many have taken a “high vs. low” approach – i.e. they 
8 
consider two or perhaps three levels of environmental severity (disturbance and/or 
9 
stress), and have frequently found that with increasing severity the beneficial impacts 
10 
of neighbours increase (e.g. Greenlee & Callaway 1996; Pugnaire & Luque 2001; 
11 
Maestre et al. 2003a; Gómez-Aparicio et al. 2004; Kikvidze et al. 2006a). However, 
12 
such studies often focus on interactions that are clearly facilitative, and examine one 
13 
particular species pairing – they do not allow a more general test of changes in the 
14 
“average” type of interactions found within plant communities (but see Cavieres et al. 
15 
2002, 2006).  
16 
 
17 
A few studies have attempted to take a broader approach and examine patterns at the 
18 
community level or across a gradient. For example, Choler et al. (2001) found that 
19 
increasing altitude was associated with increasing frequency of facilitative 
20 
interactions, but that facilitation also depended on species identity - those species that 
21 
tended to be facilitated were commonly the ones at the extreme ends of their 
22 
environmental tolerance (see also Liancourt et al. 2005 for a similar example from 
23 
calcareous grasslands), and that facilitation led to range expansion, a process that has 
24 
been discussed in detail by Bruno et al. (2003) with respect to niche theory. Callaway 
25

----- Page 11 (native) -----
10
et al. (2002), in a separate study of arctic and alpine plant communities, found a 
1 
generic shift in the average type of interaction along a large-scale climatic gradient, 
2 
with facilitative interactions in colder environments and increasingly competitive 
3 
average interactions in more productive environments. In a study conducted along an 
4 
aridity gradient, Holzapfel et al. (2006) found a steady and consistent shift from net 
5 
positive or neutral effects to net negative effects of desert shrubs on annual species 
6 
with increasing water availability. In contrast, but in a study conducted on only one 
7 
species pair, Maestre & Cortina (2004) found a switch from competition to facilitation 
8 
and then back to competition along a gradient of decreasing rainfall in a semi-arid 
9 
steppe system. Similarly, Pennings et al. (2003) failed to find support for predictions 
10 
from the SGH in a study conducted over a large-scale geographical gradient in salt 
11 
marshes, and Tielbörger & Kadmon (2000a) found that the effect of desert shrubs on 
12 
annuals shifted from negative to neutral or neutral to positive (depending on the 
13 
species) with increasing annual rainfall.  
14 
 
15 
In addition to field tests of the SGH, simple individual-based models have also 
16 
examined the relationship between the distribution of interactions and environmental 
17 
severity. Travis et al. (2005) found that facilitative interactions were restricted to the 
18 
most severe environmental conditions when the stress gradient acted upon 
19 
reproduction, but when it acted upon mortality competitive interactions were again 
20 
prevalent at the most extreme end of the gradient (Travis et al. 2006). These results 
21 
match the conclusions of Goldberg et al.’s (1999) review of field experiment studies 
22 
that the observed relationship between environmental severity and success depends in 
23 
part on the measure of success that is used (establishment, biomass accumulation, 
24 
mortality or reproductive output). However, the conclusions of Goldberg et al.’s 
25

----- Page 12 (native) -----
11
review (and studies therein) may themselves be biased by use of inappropriate indices 
1 
to test the hypotheses examined (Brooker et al. 2005; Gaucherand et al. 2006).  
2 
 
3 
Additional factors proposed as influencing the outcome of SGH studies include 
4 
relatively short-term experiments, the confusion of variation in a specific resource or 
5 
environmental factor with variation in stress - it is noticeable, for example that none 
6 
of the cited studies that contradict the SGH was explicitly linked to gradients in 
7 
productivity, the most fundamental metric of stress for a community (Grime 1977; 
8 
Lortie et al. 2004b) - a lack of adequate control for the occurrence of other stress 
9 
factors or ontogenetic effects (but see Armas & Pugnaire 2005; Miriti 2006; Schiffers 
10 
& Tielbörger 2006), or the effects of resource vs. non-resource stress factors (e.g. 
11 
water availability and vapor pressure deficit; Michalet 2007). Maestre et al. (2005), in 
12 
a meta-analysis of experiments from arid environments, concluded that there was no 
13 
generic relationship between environmental severity and plant interactions, and that 
14 
the approach used  e.g. experiments vs. observational studies  had a substantial 
15 
impact on interpretation of the relationship (see also Dormann & Brooker 2002; 
16 
Michalet 2006). Maestre et al.’s (2005) study led to considerable debate; Lortie & 
17 
Callaway (2006) concluded that study selection for the analysis was not rigorous, and 
18 
that differences in stress gradient lengths between studies could have a considerable 
19 
impact on results, criticisms that have been disputed by Maestre et al. (2006).  
20 
 
21 
It is therefore difficult to conclude whether the current uncertainty surrounding the 
22 
SGH is the result of the analytical approach used (either in the field or statistically), 
23 
the scale at which processes are examined (i.e. within a community through time, or 
24 
across a local- or continental-scale environmental gradient) or the type of severity 
25

----- Page 13 (native) -----
12
gradient used (resource vs. non-resource or temporal vs. spatial). However, progress 
1 
in understanding this relationship is crucial, both for enhancing our fundamental 
2 
ecological knowledge and also for improving predictions of processes such as the 
3 
impacts of climate change on plant communities or the links between facilitation, 
4 
diversity and ecosystem function (Loreau & Hector 2001; Bertness & Ewanchuck 
5 
2002; Brooker 2006). It is important, therefore, that researchers pursue and attempt to 
6 
resolve this debate, and we return to these issues below in Facilitation and 
7 
environmental gradients. 
8 
 
9 
THE INTEGRATION OF FACILITATION INTO MAINSTREAM ECOLOGICAL 
10 
THEORY 
11 
Although positive interactions were a component of the integrated community 
12 
concept as proposed by Clements (1916), Gleason’s (1926) view that communities 
13 
were simply an assortment of species with similar adaptations to the abiotic 
14 
environment “has emerged as the favourite among ecologists” (Callaway 1997). 
15 
When interactions have been addressed in theories of plant community or population 
16 
ecology (e.g. Grime 1977; Tilman 1988) they have tended to be negative, competitive 
17 
interactions (except for the handful of well-recognised examples mentioned above). 
18 
However, given the demonstration that facilitative interactions are widespread and can 
19 
regulate the success of individuals and the composition of communities, there is 
20 
clearly a need to revisit mainstream ecological theory in order to integrate within it 
21 
the role of facilitative interactions.  
22 
 
23 
Recent studies have attempted such integration. Bruno et al. (2003), in a study that 
24 
focussed strongly on evidence from coastal and marine ecosystems, discussed revision 
25

----- Page 14 (native) -----
13
of niche theory to include the potential for expansion of the realised niche by 
1 
facilitation (as empirically demonstrated by Hacker & Gaines 1997; Choler et al. 
2 
2001), positive density-dependence at high population densities, inclusion of 
3 
facilitation in the diversity-invasibility paradigm, and the role of dominant species in 
4 
regulating local diversity.  
5 
 
6 
The severity gradient issue in particular is fundamental to classic theories of species 
7 
diversity. One of the first attempts to explore the role of facilitation as a regulator of 
8 
diversity was that of Hacker & Gaines (1997) who, working from the humped-back 
9 
model of diversity (Grime 1973; Huston 1979), suggested a conceptual scheme in 
10 
which the positive effects of facilitation on biodiversity (species richness) increase 
11 
from intermediate to very high environmental severity, in line with predictions from 
12 
the SGH. Michalet et al. (2006) further developed these ideas, suggesting that 
13 
facilitation promotes diversity at medium to high environmental severity levels by 
14 
expanding the range of stress-intolerant competitive species into harsh physical 
15 
conditions (as discussed by Bruno et al. 2003 and demonstrated by e.g. Choler et al. 
16 
2001), but that when environmental conditions become extremely severe the positive 
17 
effects of the benefactors wane and diversity is reduced, indicating that biotic 
18 
interactions shape both sides of the humped-back curve of diversity. Perhaps one of 
19 
the most striking examples of the potential importance of facilitation for the 
20 
maintenance of biodiversity is that described by Valiente-Banuet et al. (2006). They 
21 
found that a large number of ancient Tertiary plant lineages, which evolved under 
22 
much wetter climatic conditions than found in the Mediterranean-climate ecosystems 
23 
where they now live, have been preserved by facilitative nurse plant effects from 
24 
modern Quaternary species. In the absence of such interactions the flora of these 
25

----- Page 15 (native) -----
14
regions would be significantly altered, and facilitative interactions have therefore 
1 
played “a central role in the preservation of global biodiversity”.  
2 
 
3 
As a consequence of these recent attempts to integrate facilitation into at least some 
4 
classic ecological theories, researchers have gained new insight into these classic 
5 
theories, and have also started to redress the excessive dominance of the 
6 
individualistic paradigm of community composition. However, considerable advances 
7 
still need to be made in this integration process, and it will probably take a significant 
8 
amount of time for a more integrated community concept (as proposed by Lortie et al. 
9 
2004a) to become widespread in ecological thinking.  
10 
 
11 
Looking to the future 
12 
These short reviews highlight ongoing and new areas of debate, and illustrate the 
13 
significant potential for future research into plant facilitation. In this section we 
14 
discuss what we consider to be some of the most interesting topics for future research 
15 
and, where possible, the approaches by which they could be taken forward.  
16 
 
17 
IMPROVING OUR UNDERSTANDING 
18 
Facilitation and environmental gradients 
19 
To understand the shifting balance between positive and negative interactions along 
20 
environmental gradients, and changes in the dominant type of interactions, we must 
21 
design and implement more complex experiments. These should, whenever possible, 
22 
include the following aspects: (i) several co-occurring stress factors (e.g. temperature 
23 
and water availability in arid areas and Mediterranean mountains), (ii) several levels 
24 
within each stress factor, ideally accounting for a wide range in the variation of each 
25

----- Page 16 (native) -----
15
factor (Fig. 3), and (iii) different target and nurse species, in order to control for 
1 
species-specific responses in competitive and facilitative ability and tolerance to stress 
2 
(e.g., Tielbörger & Kadmon 1995; Callaway 1998; Choler et al. 2001; Gómez-
3 
Aparicio et al. 2004; Liancourt et al. 2005). Of particular interest in testing the SGH 
4 
are experiments conducted at the extreme end of severity gradients where benefactors 
5 
may themselves be limited. Experiments should also attempt to isolate the 
6 
environmental factors affected by potential benefactors (to provide a mechanistic 
7 
explanation for severity-interaction relationships), evaluate different performance 
8 
variables (e.g. survival, growth, physiological status), attempt to account for factors 
9 
such as initial biomass effects (Goldberg et al. 1999; Kikvidze et al. 2006b), provide a 
10 
fine characterization of abiotic conditions, and be conducted over time periods long 
11 
enough to cover different life-stages in the studied species (e.g. Gómez-Aparicio et al. 
12 
2004; Miriti 2006; Schiffers & Tielbörger 2006). We acknowledge that taking into 
13 
account all these issues when designing and conducting field experiments is 
14 
challenging and costly. To overcome some of the experimental limitations, we 
15 
recommend complementing them with observational studies conducted at the 
16 
community level in multiple sites. When combined with appropriate statistical tools  
17 
such as structural equation models  these studies would allow us to assess multi-
18 
species interactions over broad geographical gradients, and to tease out the relative 
19 
influence of different stress factors on them (Kikvidze et al. 2005). 
20 
 
21 
In parallel to a rejuvenated research effort on plant interactions and severity gradients, 
22 
we must start to rigorously address the issue of the importance of facilitative 
23 
interactions. Simply because a process is detectable it does not mean that it plays a 
24 
predominant role in regulating plant success or community composition. Plant 
25

----- Page 17 (native) -----
16
community composition is commonly seen as being regulated by a series of filters 
1 
including chance biogeographical events, local abiotic environmental conditions, and 
2 
interactions with other species (Grime 1998; Lortie et al. 2004a). By differentially 
3 
regulating the success of individuals, such processes can operate as selective forces 
4 
(see Connecting facilitation to evolution). The relative impact of each filter is not 
5 
fixed, but such variation is rarely discussed, although there is a general assumption 
6 
that filters operate to regulate distribution at different scales, e.g. chance 
7 
biogeographical events are considered most important for regulating distributions at 
8 
the regional scale and biotic interactions for regulating distributions at the local scale 
9 
(but see Callaway & Ridenour 2004 and Valiente-Banuet et al. 2006 for examples of 
10 
interactions determining ranges at a global scale). Central to these discussions, but 
11 
frequently ignored, are the issues of the importance and intensity of interactions 
12 
(Welden & Slauson 1986; Grace 1991; Corcket et al. 2003a; Brooker et al. 2005; 
13 
Gaucherand et al. 2006; Grime 2007). Although the intensity of plant-plant 
14 
interactions (absolute biomass impact) may remain unaltered along an environmental 
15 
gradient, their importance (the impact of plant-plant interactions relative to other 
16 
processes) may vary. The questions then arising are when and where are facilitative 
17 
interactions not only detectable but playing a key role, and does this role vary 
18 
depending upon whether we are considering (for example) community composition or 
19 
evolutionary processes? 
20 
 
21 
The issue of the changes in the relative importance of interactions along severity 
22 
gradients is one of the most promising for community ecology research. The few 
23 
studies considering both the importance and intensity of interactions demonstrate that 
24 
they might or might not change in parallel (Brooker et al. 2005; Gaucherand et al. 
25

----- Page 18 (native) -----
17
2006), and that a detectable effect on biomass need not necessarily translate into a 
1 
fitness effect (Goldberg et al. 1999). We should start to isolate these different 
2 
measures of facilitative interactions, and we predict that facilitation is likely to be 
3 
important relative to other “filters” when and where climate stress (e.g. aridity) or 
4 
disturbance (e.g. grazing) is high but not excessive so that well-fitted benefactor 
5 
species (e.g. “nurses”) are able to grow and significantly ameliorate stress or provide 
6 
protection from disturbances. Important facilitation would be indicated when these 
7 
interactions enable a considerable number of beneficiary species to survive and 
8 
reproduce in the immediate vicinity of benefactor species.  Both low environmental 
9 
severity and excessive stress or disturbance would prevent facilitation from having a 
10 
significant role, either in regulating the composition of the community or as a 
11 
selective force. Field studies are now needed that can test these simple predictions by 
12 
considering explicitly the importance of interactions along environmental gradients 
13 
(e.g. Gaucherand et al. 2006).  
14 
 
15 
Indirect interactions and facilitation 
16 
Interest in the effects of indirect interactions among species that occupy different 
17 
trophic levels has been ongoing and has increased in recent years (Root 1973; Menge 
18 
1976; Hay 1986; Wooton 1994; Rousset & Lepart 2000; Corcket et al. 2003b; Seifan 
19 
& Kadmon 2006), but complex indirect interactions within a trophic level, or among 
20 
competitors (Aarssen 1992; Miller 1994; Levine 1999; Callaway & Pennings 2000; 
21 
Tielbörger & Kadmon 2000b) have received much less attention. The outcomes of 
22 
pair-wise interactions therefore shape our thinking and thus community theory 
23 
(Connolly et al. 2001), with pair-wise studies of competitive interactions leading to 
24 
the perspective that competitive hierarchies in plant communities are transitive, or 
25

----- Page 19 (native) -----
18
linear, with each species out-competing all those that are lower in the hierarchy. From 
1 
this we might conclude that the only outcome of strong competition in communities at 
2 
equilibrium is the exclusion of some or most members. However, this overlooks 
3 
potential positive effects that occur in multi-species communities due to non-transitive 
4 
“networks” of interactions (Aarssen 1992). When interactions take place among many 
5 
species at the same time, the competitive suppression of one species (B) by another 
6 
(A) can decrease the latter’s competitive effect on a third species (C) (Fig. 4a) thus 
7 
leading to the phenomenon of indirect facilitation. 
8 
 
9 
The occurrence of indirect facilitation may depend on complementarities in the 
10 
interactions between species and, therefore, the identities or traits of the organisms 
11 
involved (Huisman & Weissing 1999; Huisman et al. 2001). For example, in our 
12 
model system (Fig. 4) indirect facilitation is most likely when pairs of plants (A-B, B-
13 
C) compete for different resources, for example light for the first species pair, and 
14 
water or nutrients for the second (Levine 1999; Pagès & Michalet 2003; Siemann & 
15 
Rogers 2003; Kunstler et al. 2006). Plant characteristics other than resource uptake 
16 
ability may create such species-specific interactions, and thus non-transitive 
17 
interaction networks and indirect interactions (Pagès et al. 2003; Callaway & Howard 
18 
2006; Kunstler et al. 2006). Production of allelopathic chemicals may be such a trait 
19 
because of their potential for highly species-specific effects (Callaway & Howard 
20 
2006). If the existence of multiple interaction mechanisms among coexisting species 
21 
increases the potential for strong indirect interactions, indirect facilitation should be 
22 
more common in communities where several limiting factors co-occur with similar 
23 
strengths, whereas in environments with one dominant limiting factor, such as xeric, 
24 
N-poor, or low light conditions, indirect facilitation should be less important.  
25

----- Page 20 (native) -----
19
 
1 
Gradients of diversity will influence, and be influenced by, indirect facilitative 
2 
interactions. Indirect facilitation should be more common in species-rich communities 
3 
(Miller 1994; Dodds 1997). It may have the potential to sustain the coexistence of 
4 
high species diversity by reducing the potential for competitive exclusion (Czaran et 
5 
al. 2002; Laird & Schamp 2006) and may be the dominant facilitative process in more 
6 
productive environments (given the predicted reduction in direct facilitative effects). 
7 
Indirect facilitation among competitors therefore challenges assumptions about 
8 
competition consistently leading to exclusion and has interesting evolutionary 
9 
implications. For instance, Scheffer & van Nes (2006) have shown that indirect 
10 
facilitation can result in a system in which “look-a-like” species are more likely to 
11 
coexist than dissimilar species, as increased similarity is likely to lead to non-
12 
transitive networks.  However, as with the evolutionary effects of direct facilitative 
13 
interactions (see Connecting facilitation to evolution), the evolutionary consequences 
14 
of indirect facilitative effects have generally been overlooked.  
15 
 
16 
There is, therefore, substantial scope for further exploring the role of indirect 
17 
facilitative effects in plant communities, including their impacts on diversity and 
18 
evolution. Future studies, using artificial manipulations of diversity or modelling 
19 
approaches (see Development of models incorporating plant facilitation) should: i) 
20 
attempt to assess the conditions under which we might expect the greatest level of 
21 
non-transitivity within plant communities; ii) connect the degree of non-transitivity in 
22 
plant competitive networks to community diversity and facilitative promotion of 
23 
species co-existence; iii) explore how the role of non-transitivity and indirect 
24 
facilitation varies along gradients both of diversity and system productivity, and in 
25

----- Page 21 (native) -----
20
relation to direct facilitative effects; iv) explore, perhaps through multi-species 
1 
evolutionary modelling, the potential for indirect facilitative effects to drive or limit 
2 
niche differentiation, and how such processes might vary along gradients of diversity 
3 
and environmental severity. 
4 
 
5 
Development of ecological models incorporating plant facilitation 
6 
Although a broad suite of modelling approaches is available, and despite their likely 
7 
relevance and utility, they have not yet been widely employed in furthering our 
8 
understanding of the role of facilitative interactions in plant communities. This 
9 
represents a significant missed opportunity.  
10 
 
11 
Recent work illustrates the potential for relatively simple models to provide some 
12 
generic insights into the dynamics of communities that are structured with a mixture 
13 
of positive and negative interactions. Yamamura et al. (2004) studied the evolution of 
14 
mutualistic interactions and highlighted the importance of local spatial structure in 
15 
determining the outcome of interactions among a mutualistic and a cheater species. 
16 
Travis et al. (2005) extend this approach to plant facilitation issues, demonstrating 
17 
that positive interactions are most likely towards the harsh end of environmental 
18 
gradients, although this depends to on whether the gradient primarily influences 
19 
reproduction or survival (Travis et al. 2006). More recently Brooker et al. (2007) have 
20 
used these models to explore the potential impact of facilitative and competitive 
21 
interactions on the capacity of species to track a moving “climate envelope”. The 
22 
spatial arrangement of species with particular traits (as determined initially by 
23 
interactions), along with the rate of climate change and level of long-distance 
24 
dispersal, interact to regulate the capacity of species to track their climate envelope. 
25

----- Page 22 (native) -----
21
Interestingly, the comparatively slow-growing facilitators are not consistently driven 
1 
to extinction within the model community: if climate change is sufficiently slow, and 
2 
dispersal distance sufficiently low, the facilitators can continue to dominate the 
3 
habitat into which competitors are attempting to expand, and can thus limit the range-
4 
shifting capacity of competitors (Brooker et al. 2007). 
5 
 
6 
These models are a move in the right direction, but they do not yet properly represent 
7 
facilitation as most empirical plant ecologists have described it. In the mutualism 
8 
models that have been adapted for facilitation research the interaction term is 
9 
commonly +/+ (Odum 1968), i.e. reciprocal benefit. However, although mutualistic 
10 
interactions between neighbouring plants are possible, and may be more common than 
11 
currently expected (Pugnaire et al. 1996), the impact of the beneficiary on the 
12 
benefactor may range from positive to zero (+/0 commensalism), and some 
13 
interactions might even be classified as parasitic (+/-). Future modelling should 
14 
therefore start to clearly distinguish between mutualism and facilitation. Such a 
15 
distinction would, for example, be important in determining the outcome of 
16 
evolutionary modelling studies – facilitative interactions may have very different 
17 
evolutionary impacts from mutualistic interactions, and may also evolve under 
18 
different circumstances. By allowing evolution of competition and facilitation kernels 
19 
(which represent the strength of the negative and positive influence of neighbouring 
20 
plants in relation to their proximity) it could be systematically tested under which 
21 
circumstances (frequency of interactions, gene flow, etc.) facilitation might evolve as 
22 
an evolutionary stable strategy. Modelling could also explore the potential for 
23 
different life history characteristics (such as dispersal, dormancy, time to first 
24 
reproduction, self compatibility) to evolve in response to the balance between 
25

----- Page 23 (native) -----
22
facilitation and competition present within a local community. Furthermore, two-
1 
species models could be extended to multi species models enabling, for example, the 
2 
dynamics of indirect interactions to be examined in detail, including the conditions 
3 
under which this type of effect is likely to be observed in natural systems, and how its 
4 
community and evolutionary impacts might compare to those of direct facilitative 
5 
effects.  
6 
 
7 
We also suggest that there is a need to develop modelling approaches that can 
8 
accommodate variation in the role of facilitative interactions along environmental 
9 
gradients, both in space and time. If the spatial extents of positive and negative effects 
10 
differ, the net outcome of interactions will be highly dependent on the spatial relation 
11 
of the individual plants. Few, if any, experiments in the literature provide the 
12 
parameters necessary for models that can incorporate such effects, and thus adopting 
13 
this approach might need explicitly matched field experimental studies. Overall, 
14 
therefore, modelling studies dealing with interactions should combine the key 
15 
elements of neighbourhood models - individuals with an explicit location, a basal 
16 
extension where no other plant can exist, and a zone of influence on which 
17 
interactions with other plants occur (Stoll & Weiner 2000) - with the inclusion of 
18 
facilitation through, for example, facilitation kernels in addition to competition 
19 
kernels. Models of this type have the potential for a wide range of both strategic 
20 
application (providing general insights into the types of dynamics that might be 
21 
observed) and tactical application (providing specific predictions regarding particular 
22 
communities in particular geographic locations).  
23 
 
24 
Connecting facilitation to evolution 
25

----- Page 24 (native) -----
23
Recent studies have indicated that facilitation may act as an evolutionary force. For 
1 
example, Scheffer & van Nes (2006) predicted that indirect facilitation may drive 
2 
convergence of species’ niches, and Valiente-Banuet et al. (2006) suggested that 
3 
facilitation is a source of stabilising selection for the regeneration niches of ancient 
4 
Tertiary species within Mediterranean-climate ecosystems.  
5 
 
6 
When we consider the evolutionary impacts of interactions, we can readily visualise 
7 
the “competitor” syndrome that might evolve in response to strong and consistent 
8 
negative interactions in productive environments: a high, dense canopy of wide-
9 
spreading leaves, rapid potential RGR, high morphological plasticity, etc. (a classic C-
10 
strategy species; Grime 1977). However, given the multiple positive and negative 
11 
interactions that occur between individuals in severe environments, it may not be 
12 
straightforward to predict the evolutionary response to facilitative interactions, as both 
13 
facilitative and competitive mechanisms may evolve in response to facilitation. A 
14 
simple hypothetical example demonstrates the unusual and interesting evolutionary 
15 
processes that could result. In a two-species system, species A is facilitated by species 
16 
B, but any negative effects of species A could select for those B individuals that are 
17 
weaker facilitators (either by selecting against the key facilitation trait or in favour of 
18 
an avoidance mechanism in species B; Fig. 5a). However, an alternative second 
19 
selective force might favour individuals of species A with lower negative impacts on 
20 
their benefactor (Fig. 5b). 
21 
 
22 
One key trait that may come under such selection within the context of an assemblage 
23 
comprising facilitators and facilitated is dispersal. In our simple model it would seem 
24 
likely that selection might favour dispersal kernels in the facilitated species that map 
25

----- Page 25 (native) -----
24
onto those of the facilitator, for example through the evolutionary convergence of 
1 
dispersal agents, while conversely in the facilitating species selection might favour 
2 
dispersal kernels leading to the establishment of plants that can escape the negative 
3 
consequences of competition from the facilitated (Fig. 4a), unless the level of 
4 
competition is itself reduced (Fig. 4b). If strong benefits from facilitation act as 
5 
selective forces against large competitive effects they might have a key role in 
6 
explaining patterns of plant strategies, which are commonly interpreted independently 
7 
of the role of facilitation. Similarly, selection acting on characteristics such as the 
8 
balance between reproduction by clones and seed may vary depending on the nature 
9 
or balance of interactions – reproduction by seed may aid dispersal and be favoured 
10 
by avoidance of competition whereas clonal growth may be selected for by facilitation 
11 
in the immediate vicinity of the parent plant. It is interesting to speculate that the 
12 
reduced competitive effect or enhanced clonality of stress tolerant species may in part 
13 
result from selection in favour of enhanced facilitation. As stated by Brooker & 
14 
Callaghan (1998) “It may be the case that we already have evidence of the 
15 
evolutionary impact of positive plant-plant interactions, but have never examined it in 
16 
the light of this possible interpretation”.  
17 
 
18 
In our model system the outcome of the selective process will depend not only upon 
19 
the frequency and relative strength of the interactions, but also upon evolutionary 
20 
constraints on specific traits – is evolution of an avoidance mechanism in B (e.g. 
21 
through altered dispersal) more likely than reduced competitive impact from A (e.g. 
22 
through increased niche differentiation)? The evolution of life history traits will play 
23 
an important role in determining the spatial dynamics of an assemblage, resulting in a 
24 
continuous interaction between evolutionary dynamics related to the interactions and 
25

----- Page 26 (native) -----
25
the spatial ecology of the system. The extension of relatively simple models (e.g. 
1 
Travis & Dytham 1999; Travis 2002) could explore the interplay between ecological 
2 
and evolutionary dynamics that might result from these types of effects. However, 
3 
given the potential complexity involved, including variability in the two-way nature 
4 
of facilitation, a simple starting point for evolutionary studies might be to ask whether 
5 
all facilitative interactions provide common selective forces, from this predicting 
6 
patterns of traits, and then exploring whether traits vary in the expected manner along 
7 
environmental gradients in association with quantification of the importance and 
8 
intensity of interactions.  
9 
 
10 
APPLYING OUR UNDERSTANDING 
11 
Facilitation and ecosystem restoration 
12 
In the face of current rapid degradation of terrestrial ecosystems worldwide, there is 
13 
an increasing need for the development of novel, low-cost and efficient restoration 
14 
techniques for maintaining ecosystem function and services (e.g. Ormerod et al. 2003; 
15 
Hobbs et al. 2006). Because facilitation has been recognized as an important 
16 
structuring force in natural plant communities, it is being increasingly discussed as an 
17 
ecological mechanism which could be exploited for developing vegetation restoration 
18 
tools, particularly for extreme environments (Maestre et al. 2001; Padilla & Pugnaire 
19 
2006).  
20 
 
21 
Arid ecosystems offer perhaps the best current opportunity for exploring this 
22 
application, and it is well illustrated by the study of Gómez-Aparicio et al. (2004). 
23 
They examined, in water-limited Mediterranean environments, the use of naturally-
24 
occurring shrubs as nurse plants for reforestation, and found consistently over the 
25

----- Page 27 (native) -----
26
course of a 4-year study that shrubs had a beneficial effect on tree seedling survival 
1 
and growth. Such a result directly contradicted traditional reforestation management 
2 
practice, wherein shrubs were thought to compete with tree seedlings, and were thus 
3 
removed prior to the planting of seedlings (see also Castro et al. 2004). Unfortunately, 
4 
the majority of studies that address the use of nurse plants for restoration in arid 
5 
systems are usually conducted over shorter time frames, i.e. fewer than two growing 
6 
seasons (e.g. Maestre et al. 2001, 2003b, 2004; Barchuk et al. 2005; Drezner 2006). 
7 
Given the temporal variability in facilitative interactions in these systems (Tielbörger 
8 
& Kadmon 2000; Miriti 2006), this may be an insufficient period over which to assess 
9 
whether nurse plants have a net beneficial effect, and longer-term studies are clearly 
10 
needed. Furthermore, these previous studies commonly planted beneficiary species 
11 
under existing nurse plants. However, in extremely degraded semi-arid ecosystems 
12 
nurse plants may themselves be lost (Gibson & Brown 1991). In such cases 
13 
management for nurse plant re-establishment may be necessary as a first step, but it 
14 
would be important to consider whether, overall,  the use of nurse plants was the most 
15 
effective way of driving benefactee re-establishment.  
16 
 
17 
Novel techniques currently being developed in agro-ecosystems and polluted areas 
18 
demonstrate the wide range of possible uses of facilitative interactions for 
19 
environmental management. Facilitation can operate via increased pollinator visits 
20 
which lead to greater crop yields (Ricketts et al. 2004), enhanced water status of crops 
21 
growing with species capable of hydraulic lift (Pate & Dawson 1999; Sekiya & Yano 
22 
2004), the transfer of symbiotically fixed nitrogen from legumes to non-legumes 
23 
species (Jensen 1996; see also Hauggaard-Nielsen & Jensen 2005 for a review of 
24 
facilitative root interactions in agro-ecosystems), or phytostabilisation by 
25

----- Page 28 (native) -----
27
metallicolous nurse plants in heavy metal polluted environments (Frérot et al. 2006). 
1 
There may, therefore, be a wide range of facilitative mechanisms, in addition to the 
2 
classic nurse plant effect, that could act as the basis for restoration tools. 
3 
 
4 
Sutherland et al. (2004) proposed that “Much of current conservation practice is based 
5 
upon anecdote and myth” (as demonstrated by the study of Gómez-Aparicio et al. 
6 
(2004) discussed above). It would appear that in the case of restoration in severe 
7 
environments there are opportunities to move away from this situation and apply our 
8 
developing ecological knowledge. The acknowledgement of facilitation in studies of 
9 
restoration, particularly within environments that are difficult to restore, would help to 
10 
raise facilitation’s profile as a tool for natural resource conservation and management. 
11 
Furthermore, applied facilitation research also has significant unexploited potential 
12 
for advancing the science of restoration ecology in general. The explicit consideration 
13 
of facilitation when exploring key topics in this research area, such as stable 
14 
alternative states (Suding et al. 2004) or the links between ecosystem 
15 
structure/function and restoration success (Cortina et al. 2006), will likely shed new 
16 
light on our understating of these issues and, more importantly, may further help 
17 
managers and practitioners to develop effective tools to achieve the desired restoration 
18 
targets, both in terms of species composition/structure and functional status.  
19 
 
20 
Facilitation and global change 
21 
Climate change, nitrogen deposition, biological invasions and land use change have 
22 
been suggested as the current major threats to global biodiversity (Sala et al. 2000; 
23 
CBD 2003), and significant evidence is accumulating of the role of interactions, 
24

----- Page 29 (native) -----
28
including facilitative ones, in mediating the impact of these environmental change 
1 
drivers on natural communities (Brooker 2006; Maestre & Reynolds 2006, 2007).  
2 
 
3 
Several studies have demonstrated the importance of facilitation for the maintenance 
4 
of biodiversity in arctic and alpine habitats (e.g. Choler et al. 2001; Callaway et al. 
5 
2002). These habitats are predicted to be amongst the most sensitive to global 
6 
warming (Guisan & Theurillat 2000; ACIA 2004). Based on the original SGH, some 
7 
authors have predicted a general shift in species interactions from more strongly 
8 
positive to more strongly negative as these environments warm and become less 
9 
severe (e.g., Klanderud 2005; Klanderud & Totland 2005). In support of this basic 
10 
prediction, experiments that evaluated the impact of enhanced nitrogen availability in 
11 
these ecosystems (simulating the expected effect of climate change on nutrient 
12 
mineralization rates) mostly reported increased competitive interactions (e.g., Chapin 
13 
et al. 1995; Bret-Harte et al. 2004; Klanderud & Totland 2005). Similarly, in a North 
14 
American arctic tundra system, where artificially advanced snowmelt (a phenomenon 
15 
expected under global warming) created a more severe environment through increased 
16 
early-season frost events, neighbours increasingly facilitated the survival, growth and 
17 
reproduction of Empetrum nigrum (Wipf et al. 2006). However, Shevtsova et al. 
18 
(1997) reported that the positive effects of elevated temperature on the growth and 
19 
reproduction of Vaccinium vitis-idaea and Empetrum nigrum in subarctic Finland 
20 
were amplified by the presence of neighbours – in this instance a reduced level of 
21 
environmental severity (warming) lead to an increased impact of facilitative 
22 
interactions. These findings support the argument (discussed above) that the 
23 
relationship between gradients of environmental severity and the relative role of 
24 
interactions is more complicated than set out in the original SGH. At first glance we 
25

----- Page 30 (native) -----
29
might conclude that such a pattern supports the recently proposed humped-back 
1 
relationship (Michalet et al. 2006) – if these environments are on the high severity 
2 
side of the hump, then decreased severity might increase the impact of facilitative 
3 
interactions. However, it is notable that the increased role of facilitation with 
4 
decreasing severity found by Shevtsova et al. (1997) occurs within an environment 
5 
that is apparently less severe than, for example, the open tundra systems studied by 
6 
Chapin et al. (1995) and Wipf (2006) and in which the opposite pattern was observed. 
7 
Such apparently contradictory findings support the propositions that the perception of 
8 
environmental severity is to some extent species-specific, and that the response of 
9 
interactions to environmental severity at the individual species level may not reflect 
10 
the trend of average interactions within a community. 
11 
 
12 
Invasive species are another critical global change driver. In the study of biological 
13 
invasions, interactions are considered crucial in determining the success of exotics 
14 
(e.g. Daehler 2003; Simberloff et al. 2003; Vilà et al. 2004). Most studies have 
15 
focused on negative interactions as the main drivers of invasive success (e.g., 
16 
Callaway & Aschehoug 2000; Colautti et al. 2004; Mitchell et al. 2006). However, a 
17 
number have also reported that facilitation by other exotics (Simberloff & Von Holle 
18 
1999) or by natives (Maron & Connors 1996; Richardson et al. 2000; Lenz & Facelli 
19 
2003; Cavieres et al. 2005) can promote exotic invasion.  For instance, Maron & 
20 
Connors (1996) reported that the nitrogen-fixing native shrub Lupinus arboreus 
21 
facilitates the establishment of exotic species by ameliorating soil nutrient shortage. 
22 
Cavieres et al. (2005) found that the cushion plant Azorella monantha facilitates the 
23 
establishment of the exotic species Taraxacum officinale in the high-alpine zone of 
24 
the Andes of central Chile by providing microsites with milder microclimatic 
25

----- Page 31 (native) -----
30
conditions. Reinhart et al. (2006) showed how seedlings of the invasive tree Acer 
1 
platanoides had higher densities, recruitment, and survival, and less photoinhibition 
2 
and water stress when beneath conspecific canopies than when growing under 
3 
adjacent native Pseudotsuga menziesii trees; they related these differences to the 
4 
environmental modification created by the invaders. Interestingly, invasion can also 
5 
be “resisted” by greater diversity of native species (e.g. Zavaleta & Hulvey 2004; 
6 
Fargione & Tilman 2005), another mechanism by which facilitation of natives may 
7 
help resist the influx of invasive species. 
8 
 
9 
Improving our understanding of facilitative interactions is therefore of direct 
10 
relevance to understanding the impacts of environmental change drivers on 
11 
biodiversity. For example, resolution of debate concerning the SGH may enable us to 
12 
more accurately predict changes in the role of interactions in response to 
13 
environmental change, or the conditions under which interactions might restrict or 
14 
enhance biodiversity change, for example through the influx of invasives. However, it 
15 
is not necessarily the case that radical new experiments are needed to explore these 
16 
issues. As with restoration ecology, simply recognising the potential role of 
17 
facilitation, and including it within both experimental designs and the interpretation of 
18 
ecosystem responses, could provide us with valuable insights into facilitation both as 
19 
a mediator of global change and a fundamental ecological process. 
20 
 
21 
Conclusions 
22 
Our coverage cannot hope to be fully comprehensive in an essay review such as this. 
23 
Other relevant topics which we have touched upon at best only briefly include the 
24 
possible impacts of facilitation on ecosystem function (Hector et al. 1999), the use of 
25

----- Page 32 (native) -----
31
indices in plant interaction studies (as hotly debated with respect to competition 
1 
indices; Markham & Chanway 1996; Freckleton & Watkinson 1997a, b; Markham 
2 
1997; Freckleton & Watkinson 1999), or the possible contrasting consequences of 
3 
diffuse and species-specific facilitation (e.g. the general facilitative effects of 
4 
neighbours in alpine environments compared to the specific one-on-one facilitative 
5 
impacts of nurse plants). However, we have covered what are widely recognised as 
6 
some of the central current issues for plant facilitation research, and should perhaps 
7 
now answer the questions posed at the outset of this review.  
8 
 
9 
Firstly, has the recent substantial research effort taken this field forward? Yes, 
10 
undoubtedly, both in terms of developing general models and in exploring some of 
11 
their underlying complexity, and also in raising general awareness of the widespread 
12 
and important role of facilitative interactions in plant communities.  
13 
 
14 
Secondly, what gaps in our knowledge of facilitative interactions need to be 
15 
addressed? Clarification of the relationship between interactions and environmental 
16 
gradients is central for further progress, and necessitates the design and 
17 
implementation of more complex experiments than undertaken to date. There is also 
18 
substantial scope for exploring indirect facilitative effects, including their impacts on 
19 
diversity and evolution, and future studies should attempt to connect the degree of 
20 
non-transitivity in plant competitive networks to community diversity and facilitative 
21 
promotion of species co-existence, perhaps exploring how the role of indirect 
22 
facilitation varies along environmental gradients. Certain ecological modelling 
23 
approaches could provide highly useful tools for exploring these fundamental 
24 
processes, and also clearly lend themselves to studying the unusual evolutionary 
25

----- Page 33 (native) -----
32
responses that might result from facilitative interactions, perhaps even leading to re-
1 
assessment of the evolution of plant growth forms.  
2 
 
3 
Thirdly, do we know enough about facilitative interactions to understand their role in 
4 
mediating the impact of environmental change drivers, or to use this knowledge to 
5 
mitigate such impacts? The answer to this question is probably no. We know enough 
6 
to recognise that improved understanding of facilitation processes is directly relevant 
7 
to both ecosystem restoration (and may form the basis of restoration management 
8 
tools), and to understanding the response of plant species and communities to key 
9 
environmental change drivers such as invasive alien species and global change. 
10 
However, attempts to apply of our developing ecological knowledge to these fields 
11 
are at an early stage, and would benefit from explicit recognition of the potential role 
12 
of facilitative plant-plant interactions in the design and interpretation of studies of 
13 
restoration and global change ecology. 
14 
 
15 
It is clear, therefore, that considerable research challenges exist, but that expanding 
16 
our fundamental understanding of facilitation, applying that knowledge to key 
17 
ecological problems, and attempting to further integrate our developing knowledge of 
18 
facilitation into mainstream ecological theory will undoubtedly bring an improved 
19 
understanding of both plant facilitation and community ecology in general.

Figure 3. Summary of field experiments evaluating the net effect of either Pinus 
18 
halepensis  (white symbols) or Stipa tenacissima (black symbols) on the post-summer 
19 
survival (between eight and ten months after planting) of seedlings of different 
20 
Mediterranean shrub species, demonstrating the importance of setting up wide abiotic 
21 
stress gradients when evaluating the response of plant-plant interactions to them, and 
22 
the fact that the relationship between these gradients and plant-plant interactions is 
23 
more complicated that set out in the original stress-gradient hypothesis (Bertness & 
24 
Callaway 1994). Positive and negative values of the RII index indicate net facilitative 
25

and competitive interactions, respectively. As suggested by Lortie & Callaway (2006), 
1 
seedling survival in the open areas without vegetation was used as a surrogate of 
2 
abiotic stress. RII was calculated as (SN-SO)/(SN + SO), where SN and SO are the 
3 
survival of seedlings planted under the canopy of either Pinus or Stipa and in open 
4 
areas without vegetation, respectively (Armas et al. 2004). All the experiments were 
5 
conducted with one-year old seedlings planted with the same methodology (manually-
6 
dig holes) in semiarid Stipa steppes and Pinus plantations of Alicante (SE Spain).

Figure 4. Indirect (dotted line) and direct (solid line) interactions in a complex 
11 
system: (a) Species A suppresses species B, which affects the potential negative effect 
12 
of species B on C. As suggested by Levine (1976), if the benefit from suppression is 
13 
higher than the direct negative effects, indirect facilitation occurs in the community.  
14 
However, the benefit from suppression can be outweighed by direct negative effects, 
15 
resulting in no net indirect facilitation (Levine 1999; Pagès et al. 2003), (b) non-
16 
transitive interactions (A>B, B>C,C>A).  The suppression of species B by A causes 
17 
an indirect facilitation of species C, which increases its negative effect on A. In such a 
18 
system the species ameliorate each other’s effects and contribute to long-term 
19 
coexistence (Czaran et al. 2002; Callaway & Howard 2006).

Figure 5. Simple scenarios for the evolutionary impact of facilitation. Solid lines 
22 
show direct interactions, dotted lines show evolutionary responses. Species B 
23 
facilitates species A, while species A has some negative effect on species B (thick and 
24 
thin solid lines respectively). (a) The negative effects of species A cause selection to 
25

----- Page 54 (native) -----
53
favour those species B individuals with lower facilitative impacts. Evolution would 
1 
act to weaken the facilitatory effect. (b) Within species A, individuals with lower 
2 
negative features will be selected, since they maximise the advantages of the presence 
3 
of species B, thus decreasing the negative effects of A and maintaining the neutral 
4 
features of species B that benefit species A.
