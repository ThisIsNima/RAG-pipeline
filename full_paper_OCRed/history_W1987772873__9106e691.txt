ABSTRACT
Darwinian theory has yet to explain ade-
quately the fact of sex. If males provide little or no aid to
offspring, a high (up to 2-fold) extra average fitness has to
emerge as a property of a sexual parentage if sex is to be stable.
The advantage must presumably come from recombination but
has been hard to identify. It may well lie in the necessity to
recombine defenses to defeat numerous parasites. A model
demonstrating this works best for contesting hosts whose
defense polymorphisms are constrained to low mutation rates.
A review of the literature shows that the predictions of parasite
coevolution fit well with the known ecology of sex. Moreover,
parasite coevolution is superior to previous models of the
evolution of sex by supporting the stability of sex under the
following challenging conditions: very low fecundity, realistic
patterns of genotype fitness and changing environment, and
frequent mutation to parthenogenesis, even while sex pays the
full 2-fold cost.
Parasite coevolution will be shown to be superior to previous
models of the evolution of sex by supporting the stability of
sex under the following challenging conditions.
(i) Very low fecundity as in scarabs and humans. In
previous modeling (1, 2), it has been found easy to show an
advantage to sex when fecundities and mortalities are high,
as for example in reproduction of trees, fungi, and marine
invertebrates. Difficulties with low fecundities (as in humans)
have been much greater. One author has suggested that sex
is inherently unstable in such groups and that its retention is
due to the difficulty of mutation to parthenogenesis (1).
(ii) Realistic patterns of genotype fitness and changing
environment. Attempts to cope with low fecundities have had
to use high fitness differences entailing dramatic changes per
generation (2-5). When more realistic assumptions and val-
ues were applied to a model that used two recombining loci
(3), the model failed (6).
(iii) Frequent mutation to parthenogenesis, even while sex
pays the full 2-fold cost. Authors have pointed out that
mutation to efficient parthenogenesis is unlikely and seldom
seen and have claimed that this reduces the problem (1, 7, 8).
Situations where parthenogenesis would be an advantage are
extremely numerous, however, and routine successful par-
thenogenesis, including facultative use of the mode, has
evolved hundreds of times in both plants and animals (5).
(iv) Very broadly overlapping generations as in trees and
humans. Coevolutionary models of sex (3, 4) depend upon
intrinsic oscillation and are sensitive to factors creating or
reducing lags in feedback. Sequential (iteroparous) reproduc-
tion dissipates fluctuation. No models have hitherto met the
challenge of this pattern, which is common in fully sexual
organisms.
Parasites and Sex
Parasites are ubiquitous. There are almost no organisms too
small to have parasites. They are usually short-lived com-
pared to their hosts, and this gives them a great advantage in
rate of evolution. Thus antiparasite adaptations are in con-
stant obsolescence. To resist numerous parasites, hosts must
continually change gene combinations (3, 9-21). Contrary to
the assumption of the mutation theory (22, 23), the host
species needs to preserve not one ideal genotype but rather
an array. In the course of this preservation, selective changes
in the midrange ofgene frequency must be common. Because
single and multiple heterozygosity is maximal for genes in the
midrange, the effectiveness of events of recombination in
uncoupling these changes is great, thus providing power to
the model that we now describe.
We simulated a host population of 200 individuals that are
either sexual hermaphroditic or else all-female and parthe-
nogenetic; the difference is controlled by a single gene. 11 All
are of equal fertility in the sense that chances to be a parent
in each year are assigned fairly to all living mature individ-
uals. However, sexual parents are paired and share offspring.
Therefore they reproduce their genes with only half the
efficiency of asexual parents and "fair assignment" as above
embodies the 2-fold advantage of parthenogenesis. In fact, in
the absence of selection through differential mortality, the
population extremely rapidly eliminates the allele for sex. It
should be noted, however, that we are assuming males or
male functions do not contribute to the number or biomass of
offspring; otherwise, the mated pairs would have more nearly
an average of two offspring born when the lone parthenogen
has one.
The population is assumed to be at a stable density with an
average death rate d = 1/h = 1/14 = 0.0714 per individual per
year applying at all ages. Reproduction is assumed to occur
on birthdays, but there is a juvenile period ofj = 13 years
during which individuals do not reproduce; thereafter, at
exactly age 14 the "fair chance" to participate in reproduc-
tion begins and continues indefinitely. For a population of
stable age distribution under no selection, the mean level of
fecundity needed to replace deaths is easily found by sum-
ming geometric series as in standard theoretical demography
to bef = d/(l - dY+1 = 0.2016 per individual per year (see
also ref. 24); the mean age of parenthood (a measure of
generation length) is G =j + h = 27. The particular parameter
values above are chosen to imitate primitive hominid
reproduction.** Among the parameters so far defined, d

conservative test of the model.

(accompanied by its h) is different from all others in that,
although it is fixed as a mean for the population as a whole,
it varies over individuals according to genotype because of
effects of parasites: this is the sole kind of selection on hosts
in the model. How the variation in mortality comes about in
the model will now be described in full detail.
The host population is subject to n (2-12) species ofasexual
parasites; each species also has a population of 200. All
parasites havejp = 0 and Gp = 0 + 1/dp = 1.1, so that dp =
0.909. Many other combinations of the host and parasite
demographic and selection severity parameters have been
tried. The results, not reported here, were generally similar
to those that will be described provided parasite generations
remain short compared to those of the host. As expected,
changes that simulated less broadly iteroparous reproduction
by means ofa menopause (see footnote **) placed close to the
age of first reproduction made sex succeed better; thus, the
schedule having a wide overlap tests a fairly difficult case.
Both hosts and parasites are haploid. Each parasite species
is assigned k loci for its own chromosome. The host's
chromosome has a defense sector of k loci for each of the n
parasite species. Hosts also have a sex-determining locus so
that total host chromosome length is 1 + nk. Alleles are 0 and
1. Each year, every host randomly acquires one parasite of
every species, n in all. A parasite's fitness is evaluated by
matching its chromosome with the assigned section of its
host's chromosome and counting matched alleles. Thus if the
host's section reads 00110 and the parasite's section reads
01111, the sum is Sp = 3. The maximum here, obtained with
identical strings, would be 5. To fix ideas further by a
potentially realistic example of only three loci, imagine that
humans are haploid but still manifest the Lewis/secretor/
ABO blood group system (25, 26) except that we also reduce
the ABO locus to only two alleles (say A and 0). Suppose
that, corresponding to the 23 = 8 now possible genotypes and
phenotypes of this system (of which none, on the known gene
frequencies, would be very rare), there exist eight strains or
species ofa pathogen, each maximizing reproductive success
when the states of alleles at three of its own loci match those
of the host and that one unit of "match score" is subtracted
from a maximum score of 3 for each mismatched allele, then
this would become an example of a single "parasite defense
sector" in the genome of our "Haplohomo," relevant to the
model. Quite apart from the haploidy, the example remains
fanciful in that no such complete diversity of differing mi-
crobial enemies involved with the ABO system is yet known.
However, there is little doubt that infectious microbes are
involved in maintaining the polymorphism; several very
distinct groups of parasites, as well as strains within partic-
ular species, have already been implicated.tt In the model,
reproduction is to simulate varied realistic life histories, including,
if required, the extreme ofonce-for-all reproduction (semelparity).
Another reason is to forestall the criticism that, if only semelpar-
ous reproduction had been used, with overlap of host generations,
the model might have failed to cycle and led to loss of sex. The
demography given is easily extended to include a menopause. Ifm
fertile years start at agej + 1, the first menopause birthday isj +
m +
1. If mean annual (interbirthday) survival is v = 1 - d,
independent of age, the formulas of the text become modified tof
= d/{vI+l (1 - vm)} and G = j + h - [mvm/(1 - vm)]. Such
formulas (found by summing appropriate finite geometric series)
merely display necessary average consequences of parameters j,
m, and d that arise under the given demography and are never used
by the model itself. Results of runs in which m is used to set a
hominid menopause are mentioned below in Low Fertility and
Penetrance.
ttGenera of microorganisms shown to correlate with various phe-
notypes of the human highly polymorphic Lewis/secretor/ABO
system include Schistosoma (27), Giardia (28), Leishmania (29,
30), Mycobacterium (31), Neisseria (32, 33), Streptococcus (32),
Haemophilus (34), Escherichia, and Vibrio (35), albeit some cor-
match scores as described are used to determine fitnesses as
follows. The "parasite score" determines both the parasite's
rank among conspecifics after it has detached and is com-
peting to survive into the next year and also the parasite's
proportionate relative fecundity for the year. At the same
time, the parasite's match makes a contribution to the "host
score" ofk - Sp; when all parasites are considered, the host's
total score therefore becomes S = nk - ESP. Unlike parasite
scores, host scores have no effect on fertilities, but they are
used to rank all 200 hosts; then the 14 lowest ranked (because
200 x d rounds off to 14) are killed. For parasites, 200 x dp
rounds off to 182, so this number are killed. The system may
be described as rank-order truncating "soft" selection
through mortality (2, 44).
Mating of the sexuals is at random and their reproduction
is with recombination at a rate r between all adjacent loci.
(For example, for a case with n = 1 and k = 3, chosen to
simulate eight parasites genotypes bearing on the haploid
Lewis/secretor/AO blood group system as outlined above, r
= 0.5 could be chosen realistically because the three loci in
Homo sapiens appear to be unlinked.) Reproduction of
asexuals is faithful to the parent except for mutation. All
genes in hosts, both sexual and asexual, including the sex
locus, have a mutation rate m = 0.0001 or else, in half the
runs, m = 0.01. All loci in parasites have a mutation rate of
0.01. This rather high rate is chosen to ensure parasite ability
to relocate recombinant genotypes within reasonable time
despite lack of sex-the parasite threat must be acute.t
The dynamics of this model can be thought of as a group
pursuit around the vertices of an nk dimensional hypercube.
The parasites evolve toward maximizing and the hosts evolve
toward minimizing the matching of chromosomes. Such a
process both tends to protect polymorphism and gives an
endlessly unstable coevolution (45-47). Trajectories of gene
frequencies (and of linkage disequilibria) in our model are
irregular. Gene frequency has the widest range when nk is
low; as nk is raised, the amplitude decreases but the support
for sex nevertheless improves. It is worth noting, however,
that even our highest value of nk (2 x 7 = 14) falls far short
of the number of loci known to affect resistance in well-
studied higher organisms. In the mouse, for example, 50 loci
distributed over 17 chromosomes are known to affect retro-
viruses alone (48). Hence our success achieved with rela-
tively few loci augurs very robust success as numbers are
increased to realistic levels.
The most acute problem ofsex is not to explain how it arose
but why it does not currently disappear in view of the much
greater efficiency of parthenogenesis. Therefore, except
briefly in the final section ofthis paper where we describe one
possible origin for sex, we treat only the potential for sex to
resist invasion by asex. To give asex a good opportunity to
invade, if it can, we assessed success by initiating the model
with equal numbers of sexuals and asexuals and then finding
the mean percentage of sexuals present during the last 50
relations may still need cautious interpretation (e.g., refs. 33 and
36). Given that blood groups-glycoproteins on blood cell surfaces
or else related moieties in serum and secretions-seem at first
unlikely agents of resistance, it is not surprising that other resis-
tance polymorphisms and heritabilities, often independent also of
other immune system loci, prove very numerous (e.g., refs. 20 and
37-43).
ffIn earlier versions, parasites also had a sex locus, but if parasite
generation was short, they usually, although not under all condi-
tions, lost the sex allele almost immediately. We therefore simpli-
fied the model by dropping sex in parasites. In nature, parasites
commonly retain sex at least at some stage of cycle, but this may
be due to (i) hyperparasitism (especially likely for large and
external parasites) or (ii) the need to combat facultative defenses
of their hosts (for example by an immune system) such counter-
threats being generated on a time scale nearer to the parasite's own
life cycle.

years of 400-year runs. To begin the model in as natural and
structured a state as possible, we ran a 70-year "grace
period" before the start. During this, the coevolution pro-
ceeded, but all individuals were asexual; then at year 0, half
had their sex gene changed from 0 to 1. In the runs, sex tends
to succeed or fail completely. Probably this is due to the
disadvantage that both sexuals and asexuals suffer when their
variation is depleted at low numbers. The internal divide
implied, however, is evidently not very high: transitions
occasionally occur within runs from at or near fixation for
asexuals to at or near fixation for sexuals and vice versa.
The results for various combinations of n and k are shown
in Fig. 1. It can be seen that success of sex increases with the
number of loci involved in defense against parasites. In Fig.
ic, it is already asymptotic to 100%, and in Fig. id, it is
everywhere already near to this except when r = 0.0. The
high level in Fig. id for nk = 2 x 2 = 4 (that is, where two
parasites are opposed by a total of only four loci) is partic-
ularly impressive.§§ Equally so is the fact that success also
§§Bell and Maynard Smith (21) ran a model similar to a case of ours
as at the rightmost corner of Fig. 1c, referring to it as their
"gene-for-gene" model. They found correspondingly low success
in advancing an allele for free recombination as against none
(frequency rose from i0-5 to 250 x 10-5 in 2000 generations and
then showed approximate stability). However, use of "hard"
selection in their model would have contributed to low success to
judge from early hard runs in ours. Our trials of a quantitative
matching model similar to their claimed more successful version
showed that this system rapidly dropped back in its support for sex
compared to the model we present as the number of loci was
increased by means of n and/or k; such reversal of success would
almost certainly apply to their hard selection pair of models also.
With a 2-fold cost, it is unlikely that merely two resistance loci
and moderate fitness differences, as in their tables, could advance
a gene for recombination. This claim is based on findings in ref. 3
and in Fig. 1. The latter shows that with four loci, especially if
paired and opposed by two parasites (right forward edge of Fig. ld),

rises steadily in almost all transects in Fig. 1 a and c as loci
increase, even if it rises somewhat behind what is being
achieved where, as in Fig. 1 b and d, fewer parasites have
been assigned more loci. The last difference is understand-
able on the grounds that the sexual host can change se-
quences in the assigned
sets of loci by recombination,
whereas the parasite can only change them by mutation. In
going from one parasite to a pair of loci to one parasite to each
locus, it is as if the extra parasite is giving the preexisting one
the ability to recombine, thus blunting the edge that a
sexually recombining host has over both its enemy and its
competitor. However, as Fig. 1 a and c shows, this detri-
mental feature of multiple single-locus resistances, which
would completely nullify selection for sex under plausible
hard selection, is far from doing so when selection is soft. Soft
selection automatically lends, even to unifactorial resis-
tances, an epistasis in fitness which, although changeable, is
always of the "plateau-with-coal pits" form that is already
known to protect variation (49); here, along with variation, it
also protects sex (50).
Fig. 1 also shows that the recombination rate is not critical
provided it is not extremely low. The runs described and
other numerical experiments we have conducted have so far
failed to show significant maxima of success for r other than
0.5. We suspect that such maxima may be demonstrated by
increasing the life span of parasites nearer to that of their
hosts so that cycles are longer (19, 51).
To suggest how the model achieves its results at least for
the simple case of n parasites resisted each by one locus (Fig.
1 a and c), the following visualization seems helpful. A light
ball floats in water; its surface is marked with the outline of
a cube. At the eight vertices, single-genotype colonies of our
host live and grow. The weight of the largest colonies makes
and with soft selection, the chance of sex succeeding is already very
much better.

the ball turn toward the side where they are. Eventually the
vertex that is heaviest goes under water; its colony is killed
by the water and drops off. When the rotation caused by the
previous heaviest colony has ceased, another side-the side
bearing the remaining heaviest vertices, which will be, prob-
ably, those longest out of the water-begins to roll down.
If the vertices of the cube are labeled with three-locus
two-allele host genotypes, 000, 001, 010, etc., in the obvious
way, and if weight in the model has not to do directly with
biomass of colonies but rather with an accumulation of ill
health that follows upon abundance, due to coevolution, then
the moving image is very closely analogous to the working of
the model. We can see at once, for example, that it is
important how heavily the ball rests in the water-the water
line is analogous to the mortality rate. Thus, heavy mortality
is likely to eliminate alleles even of the sexual subpopulation:
such loss becomes inevitable, for example, if a whole face of
the cube goes under at once. This emphasizes the difference
of the present model from previous ones in which high
mortalities were essential (1, 2) or merely highly favorable (3,
4). The previous models, however, failed to say how vari-
ability is maintained. In our model, rotation about more
cornerwise axes of the unweighted cube is good for preserv-
ing polymorphism and for sex because it minimizes submer-
gence of faces. However the most important point that the
visualization makes is that no one vertex carrying asexuals is
going to escape nemesis for long, because the longer a vertex
is out of the water the more weight (that is, numbers, followed
by parasite matching) gathers upon it.
If mutation is rare, eliminated asexual genotypes are very
slow to come back. Of course, sexual genotypes at the same
vertex die too, but they are by comparison very easily
recreated (52). Specifically, they are brought back by matings
between individuals at appropriate opposite corners. Most
important, as the number ofpolymorphic loci (dimensions) of
the model is increased, the safety of all the alleles of the
sexual population increases also: each new locus with two
alleles diversifies each previous genotype into two new ones,
thus doubling the number of places (vertices) where carriers
of an allele can remain out of the water. Alleles that survive
extinction in this way always have a chance to recolonize
empty vertices. By spreading from the genotypes in which
they survived, the alleles again enter all combinations: sex
has been their Noah's Ark.
While not essential for successful models for sex through
parasitism, the soft selection by means of truncation is
extremely favorable to
it (50), as has been verified by
comparing hard (2, 53, 54) runs of the model. Soft selection
helps sex simply because, while it readily extinguishes clones
(52), it tends not to extinguish temporarily "bad" alleles in
sexual hosts.
Soft Truncation Selection
The power of truncation to change gene frequencies at many
loci simultaneously is well known (44, 55). Under the soft
truncation selection of the present model, permanent poly-
morphism instead offixation arises plausibly and strongly out
of the inevitable frequency dependence of the host-parasite
interaction. Multilocus interaction with multiple parasites
reduces amplitudes and creates situations more and more
favorable to sex. This proceeds in several ways.
First,
multilocus polymorphism creates numerous genotypes and
the possibility for every individual to be genetically unique.
Every event of truncation then eliminates members of more
than one genotype. It follows that currently bad alleles must
often be in "good" company. Such alleles are both protected
from immediate selection and unlikely to be recombined into
the very low ranking classes that are subject to truncation in
fewer generations than it takes for their disadvantage to be
reversed. Second, frequency dependence ensures removal of
genotypes that are common and that carry abundant alleles.
Third, inherent lags due to generation turnover and to linkage
disequilibria emphasize recent abundance over present or
future, inducing overshoot and consequent tendency to cy-
cle. The combined result of these factors
is that, with
increasing loci, the danger for sex ceases to be of allele
extinction and lost variability and becomes rather that the
model may reach multilocus equilibrium and not cycle at all.
In practice, however, equilibrium is not observed: the de-
stabilization implied by the third factor and by the truncation
itself appears always adequate to keep the system mobile.
Fig. 2 shows that at least under the assumed symmetrical
conditions of parasite interaction, after asexuals are elimi-
nated, gene frequency remains mostly in the midrange for
multilocus runs, and linkage disequilibria are low. The con-
ditions chosen for Fig. 2 are those where sex is maximally
stable, similar to conditions on the rearmost corner of Fig.
1d, except for lower mutation.
To check that polymorphism continues as protected as
appears in Fig. 2, a run with the same parameters was
continued for 7000 generations. This ended fixed for sex and
with all resistance loci still variable. To challenge the model
further, a second run of 7000 generations was conducted in
which mutation from asex to sex was not allowed and
environmental variation was added. Mutation rates at the sex
and resistance loci were made 0.001 (sex to asex only) and
0.0, respectively. Gaussian environmental variation was
added to the match scores to an extent that the added
variance was four times the variance expected from matching
in a neutral model. The result of the test was as before except
that incursions of asex were more frequent and of greater
magnitude. Still, the incursions hardly every rose to half the
population before declining, and still no fixations of resis-
tance loci were observed.11
The symmetry of the model that leads to gene frequencies
distributed around 0.5 is admittedly artificial. However,
much more generally significant and more potentially testable
is the implication of episodic upward selection on minority
alleles. The mutation theory (23) in contrast lacks such
selection: if at all, mutant alleles only reach substantial
frequencies by genetic drift. It should be possible, given some
identical repeats of the by now numerous surveys of elec-
trophoretic variation in wild populations (reviewed in ref. 56),
to test for the intervening occurrence of upward and down-
ward pressures and also reversals.
The essence of sex in our theory is that it stores genes that
are currently bad but have promise for reuse. It continually
tries them in combination, waiting for the time when the focus
of disadvantage has moved elsewhere. When this has hap-
pened, the genotypes carrying such genes spread by success-
ful reproduction, becoming simultaneously stores for other
bad genes and thus onward in continuous succession. In
contrast, asexual genotypes lost in the same phases of
truncation come back much more slowly by mutation only. A
lost allele that specifies a complex task-specific molecule may
not come back at all.
Parasites vs. Mutation: The Evidence of Ecology
Unfortunately for checking the idea against nature and dis-
criminating it from other views, the main contender idea, that
of mutation clearance, also works best under soft truncation
selection (57). Hence many of its predictions are the same.
IlRuns have shown that without the addition of environmental
variation even a one-way mutation rate of 0.01, when combined
with other parameters as in back left planes of Fig. 1, still does not
result in loss of sex: some asexuals are then present at all times but
generally remain at very low frequencies.

FIG. 2.
Example set of trajectories in one run for gene frequencies of the allele for sex (a), and 3 of 14 resistance loci (b), and linkage
disequilibrium among these three resistance loci (c), shown every fourth generation. Model parameters are those of the most distant corner of
Fig. ld and are as described in the text except that mutation rates are lower: 0.00001 for hosts (all loci) and 0.005 for parasites. The run is started
with 25% sexuals.
Both theories, for example, predict that species should be
most sexual when they occupy saturated habitats, compete
with members of their own species, and compete by contest
rather than fecund breeding. "By contest" here is meant that,
while most individuals easily could breed almost as effec-
tively as those that do, many do not breed because of lack of
access to some essential prerequisite. This may be a nest hole
(if a bird), territory, membership of a group, position in the
canopy of the forest (if a tree), or the like. If success in
contests for limiting resources is dependent on health and
health depends on either mutation load or parasite resistance,
both theories predict sex will win. Such a prediction does
seem to be fulfilled (5, 58). Climax or "K-selected" kinds of
species
are usually sexual, and
it
is generally the
"r-
selected," colonizing life forms, for which contest competi-
tion is minimal, that have the wasteful male aspects of
reproductive function reduced or, as in parthenogens, com-
pletely abandoned. The basis of such a prediction is, we
believe, unique to these theories; however, the facts them-
selves have often been presented (5, 59-61), usually with
different correlates such as harshness or physical fluctuation
of environment suggested as cause.
It may be hoped that further details of the ecology of
parthenogenesis and inbreeding may help to evaluate the two
theories. However, this may not be easy, even by experi-
ments. Both deleterious mutations and parasites make orga-
nisms sick, and both theories suggest that self-assessment of
being sick, when there is a choice of sexual or asexual
reproduction, ought to direct use of sex or, within sex, direct
a higher rate of recombination. Thus the results of an
experiment in which a population of daphnia,
say, was
exposed on the one hand to mutagens and on the other to
parasites and in the control to optimal conditions might well
come out favorinn
or disfavoring the theories jointly but fail
to discriminate. 1I1
11 Both mutation clearance and parasite resistance must have out-
breeding to work. Since Darwin and earlier, numerous examples

Some circumstantial evidence from nature, however, fa-
vors parasites. For example, organisms of environments
expected to be mutagenic but not parasite infested do not
seem to be highly sexual, but rather the converse. High levels
of ionizing solar radiation in alpine habitats might be sup-
posed mutagenic, and yet parthenogenetic and inbreeding
plants are common there (5, 66). In plants more generally, the
association of diminished or abandoned sexuality with the
colonizing habit is particularly obvious (18, 67-75). This, as
already mentioned, favors both theories against many of the
alternatives. More supportive of our particular view, how-
ever,
is that the association has quite often shown the
expected lack of resistance to parasites when host densities
rise and parasites come to the fore. A particular illustration,
out of many (72-76), is the rust fungus Phragmidium viola-
ceum released in Chile for control of alien brambles. One of
the two bramble species, Rubus constrictus, is parthenoge-
netic, while the other, Rubus ulmifolius, is fully sexual and
self-incompatible. The rust has severely checked the spread
of the parthenogen, but it has affected the sexual very little
(77).
Preserve or Eliminate
The essence of the mutation theory is that sex facilitates the
elimination of unequivocally bad alleles; the essence of the
parasite theory is that sex stores temporarily bad alleles and
does not eliminate them. In our model the mutation process
translates from one potentially useful allele to another. This
is admittedly artificial. However, as presented in Fig. 1, it
serves indirectly to emphasize the conservation aspect.
When a and b are contrasted with c and d in Fig. 1, it is shown
that a high mutation rate between alternative alleles for
resistance hinders the success of sex. Recalling the image of
the floating ball or better still thinking ofan analogous floating
hypercube, note that a mutation moves an individual along an
edge of the hypercube. Thus this kind of mutation gives
mobility to asexuals approaching that which sexuals can have
through recombination and reduces the advantage of the
sexuals in replacing lost types. The point also highlights the
following argument and recent evidence.
If any change is good, evolving an increased mutation rate
must be easy. It follows that if any new variant of a protein
is effective as a tool for the host while at the same time
increasing resistance to a parasite then sex ought to die out.
That this does not happen indicates, in our view, that
mutations creating effective new versions of a defense mol-
ecule or physiological tactic are uncommon. Such being the
case, sex has the useful function of continually recombining
a set ofpreserved defensive elements (20). Elements here can
mean either parts of a complex molecular structure or parts
in some more abstract sense-components of an individual's
stance against all its currently pressing parasites. Current
understanding of disease resistance does indeed favor exis-
tence of molecular parts that would be hard to reevolve once
lost (25, 26, 78). Molecular structure coming to light in the
well-studied immune system of vertebrates, for example,
favors such interpretation. So too does the growing emphasis
on mimicry as a factor in parasitism (29, 30, 79-88). Presum-
ably almost any common, necessary, and exposed molecular
structure on or in cells of a host can be potentially mimicked,
so bringing the genetics of that structure into play.
of adaptation to secure outbreeding have been noted. Recently
mooted theories such as DNA repair (62, 63) and rapid fixation of
advantageous mutations under diploidy (64) should work as well or
better under inbreeding. Even inbreeding is unnecessary and not
ideal: rapid fixation, for example, could come from automictic
parthenogenesis, which is potentially much more efficient (65).
Mutation rates of genes, as well as rates of evolution, have
been suggested to be high for resistance (89-91), but there is
growing evidence that this is not the only reason why defense
systems are genetically so diverse. Many polymorphisms that
are either known (35) or likely (92, 93) to be connected with
disease resistance are ancient, spanning many millions of
years and the divergence of genera (78, 94-98). This begins
to be confirmed even by detailed homologies of DNA (99-
101). The polymorphisms include many of the human blood
groups (ABO, Lewis, MN, and Rhesus), the secretor poly-
morphs associated with ABO, taster for phenylthiourea,
lactate dehydrogenase, phosphoglucomutase, the Gm com-
ponent of polymorphism of immunoglobulin, carbonic anhy-
drase, and others. Esterases, by being also proteases (102),
may be more connected with microbe control than their name
suggests (95, 103). They are often multiply varied throughout
whole sets of related species, although the variants generally
remain of unknown homology. The vast and much-
researched polymorphism of the major histocompatibility
complex system presents a similar case and has unquestion-
able relevance to disease. It is now known that, far from being
arbitrary badges of identity as once thought (104, 105) (for
which purpose any mutant might be satisfactory), the histo-
compatibility proteins are more in the nature of molecular
tongs designed to hold up processed fragments derived from
parasite attack in order to alert and inform other cells (87,
105). Random change in such functional molecules is much
less likely to be successful than recombinations of compo-
nents that have already built effective structures in the past.
The last claim is also likely to be true of the combinations in
the Lewis/secretor/ABO system (25, 26), which contrasts
with the major histocompatibility complex system in that the
components are not linked.***
Although our model works best with multilocus defenses
against each parasite (compare success in b and d to that in
a and c in Fig. 1), our findings do not compel us to interpret
the model as implying a kind of molecular Lego in nature
(success is still near complete in Fig. 1c at higher n). For a
sapling tree racing with conspecifics to be first to occupy a
light gap in a woodland canopy, one parasite might be a new
virus strain, another might be a stem-mining caterpillar with
a new detoxifying enzyme, another a deer (its population
rising, perhaps, because it had found a solution to a disease
problem of its own), and another an exploitative instead of
protective variant of a mycorrhizal fungus. The necessary
correctives for these threats are quite different in character.
The first, for example, may need the recombination of
molecular parts (e.g., ref. 78), whereas the second and third
may need change of a more quantitative kind-a thickened
cuticle to prevent hatchling larvae boring in or, for the deer,
more tannin in the bark. Altogether, assembling adaptations
for any such upcoming set may have the same urgent re-
quirement for recombination as the more purely molecular
kind of rearrangement in defense previously outlined. More-
over, although it helps if parasites are capable of causing
***Parasites whose epistatic selection pattern is imposed through
direct effect on fitness potential, rather than extrinsically, as by
our truncation selection, are not yet known for the Lewis/
secretor/ABO system. However, they are not unlikely since
parasites (as well as pesticides) clearly sometimes impose direct
epistatic patterns in other species (106, 107). In wild rabbits,
polymorphism of IgG based on two unlinked genetic loci deter-
mining constant regions of the heavy and light chains reveals
strong epistatic selection. This is almost certainly due to parasites
and is quite likely due to the myxoma virus (78), but it is not yet
possible to apportion the selection to intrinsic complex selection
or/and an extrinsic soft process like truncation. If present,
intrinsic epistasis probably further favors sex. Runs of our model
with such epistasis added through the method of scoring matches
gave even stronger support than the version we report.

severe damage, even this is not necessary. Enough parasites
with small effects, each still contributing to ranking (72), can
make sex secure, tojudge from the trend we have shown. For
example, in a gorilla or hominid (to which our life schedule
gives a rough approximation), a contribution could come
from resistance to the common cold.
Low Fertility and Penetrance
Extremely low fecundities in the animal kingdom are con-
sistent with sexuality in the parasite model but not with the
mutation model as it is currently specified (23). The H.
sapiens species is usually regarded as having low fecundity,
but our species does not have the lowest fecundity, by any
means. Some scarabs have mean female life-time fecundities
as low as five but are fully sexual and indeed show exagger-
ated characters from sexual selection (108-110).
To check that our model can account for H. sapiens or an
ancestral hominid (which, by arguments based on sexual size
dimorphism, would probably lack paternal care and therefore
be more directly relevant to the model), we ran a menopause
age of 35 and a lower mortality of 1/16 per year (see also
footnote **). By combining this with 12 parasites being
resisted by one locus each, with host mutation at 0.0001 and
recombination at 0.3 (a midpoint on the back wall of Fig. ic
but with a lower, more realistic mutation rate), we found that
the model
still gave almost full success. The model has
hermaphrodite individuals, but there is no essential differ-
ence from a version where sexual individuals are born male
or female while parthenogenetic progeny, equally numerous,
are all female. Hence we confidently expect the same result
for a two-sexed case. Calculation shows that when sexuals
dominate in this parallel version, females who live right
through the reproductive period would seldom bear more
than 10 offspring, while the expectation for those just enter-
ing the period is (because of mortality) about 5. This schedule
is almost too infecund to be plausible for a human hunter
gatherer. When we brought in the model maximum of 15 loci
(triplets of loci resisting 5 parasites), at the same time lowered
the mutation rate of hosts and parasites by factors of 100 and
5, respectively (i.e., going again to rates more realistic than
those in Fig. 1), and set mortality to 1/35 while keeping the
menopause age 35, all of which gives mean gross fertility of
four, as might be appropriate to extreme scarabs (108-110),
sex is only occasionally replaced by asex in runs. It would
probably be replaced less often still if populations were made
larger.
Even with genetic resistance diluted by large amounts of
random variation, sex is still uninvadable in our model. This
is confirmed by runs with environmental variance approxi-
mately equal to the parasite-induced variance (with mean
gross fertility as low as three) and, as mentioned in an earlier
section, even with runs having four times the environmental
variance (for n = 7 and k = 2).
Mutation Rate
Keeping germinal tissues deep within a body plus using
internal fertilization and viviparity might be expected to
buffer germ-line chromosomes especially well. Therefore, in
the mutation theory, species having such characteristics
might be expected to be experiencing relaxed mutation
problems and to be frequently experimenting with gynogen-
esis and parthenogenesis. The opposite is the case:
it is
prokaryotes, those organisms that do not buffer the environ-
ment at all by a surround of cell layers, or even by a layer of
cytoplasm, that reject sex most completely. In spite of their
exposure, their rates of mutation per generation are actually
lower than those of large eukaryotes by several orders of
magnitude. This together with other data (111) suggest that
the mutation problem can be solved when sex is not present
to help; when, on the other hand, sex is present for other
reasons, mutation control can be relaxed, perhaps with
long-term advantage for evolutionary flexibility.
Origins
The parasite model of sexual reproduction suggests how sex
might have arisen in a natural and continuous manner, as
Darwinian theory generally requires. The origin of sex as
suggested by Margulis and Sagan (112) has cannibalism by
primitive unicells in times of starvation that evolves to a
stalemate (at least in some encounters), with would-be can-
nibals becoming fused but eventually separating when the
conditions ameliorate. While fused, some genetic material
might, accidentally at first, become exchanged. Our contri-
bution is to suggest the important way that genes encouraging
regular chromosome breakage and exchange might confer
advantages to their possessors, by means of the newly
created gene combinations. We suggest that eventually the
new combinations proved their worth mainly during un-
wanted contacts with smaller unicells that were specialists in
exploitation-incipient parasites.
