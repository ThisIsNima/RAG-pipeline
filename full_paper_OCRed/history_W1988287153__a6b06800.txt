Abstract--The factors affecting the amounts and types of organic matter in lacustrine sediments are 
summarized in this review, and synthesis, of published studies. Biota hving in the lake and in its watershed 
are the sources of the organic compounds initially contributed to the lake system. Microbial reworking 
of these materials during sinking and early sedimentation markedly diminishes the total amount of organic 
matter while replacing many of the primary compounds with secondary ones. Much of the organic matter 
content of sediments is the product of this microbial reprocessing. Various organic matter components 
of lake sediments nonetheless retain source information and thereby contribute to the paleohmnological 
record. Carbon/nitrogen ratios of total organic matter reflect original proportions of algal and land- 
derived material. Carbon isotopic compositions indicate the history of lake productivity and carbon 
recycling. Biomarker compounds provide important information about contributions from different biota. 
Sterol compositions and chainlength distributions of n-alkanes, n-alkanoic acids, and n-alkanols help 
distinguish different algal and watershed sources and also record diagenetic alterations. 
Stabilization of functional-group-containing biomarkers by conversion into saturated or aromatic 
hydrocarbons or by incorporation into bound forms improves their preservation and hence record of 
source information. Lignin components provide important evidence of watershed plant cover, and 
pigments reflect algal assemblages. The interplay of the factors influencing the organic matter content of 
lake sediments is illustrated by overviews of sedimentary records of four lake systems--Lake Biwa (Japan), 
Lake Greifen (Switzerland), Lake Washington (Pacific Northwest), and the Great Lakes (American 
Midwest).

INTRODUCTION 
Organic matter constitutes a minor but important 
fraction of lake sediments. It is made up of a complex 
mixture of lipids, carbohydrates, proteins, and other 
biochemicals contained in the tissues of living benthic 
micro-organisms and contributed from the detritus of 
organisms formerly living in the lake and its water- 
shed. Humic substances are diagenetically formed 
from these biochemical starting materials and consti- 
tute the major part of the complex mixture of organic 
materials. 
Significance of sediment organic matter 
The organic matter content of lake sediments par- 
ticipates in a variety of biochemical and geochemical 
processes. Benthic animals and microbes depend 
on organic matter for their nutrition. Because many 
components of organic matter are relatively easily 
oxidized forms of reduced carbon, the dissolved 
oxygen concentration of sediment pore water is 
controlled largely by the availability of oxidizable 
organic matter below the sediment/water interface. 
Furthermore, redox reactions, in which oxidized 
inorganic species become reduced by interaction with 
organic matter, are common in sediments. Organic 
matter is consequently a dynamic biogeochemical 
component of sediments. 
Organic matter also forms part of the paleolimno- 
logic record preserved in lake sediments. The different 
types of biota populating a lake and its watershed 
produce organic matter having distinctive biochemical 
compositions_ Changes in the community structure of 
these biota create variations in the amounts and types 
of organic matter deposited at different times in the 
history of a lake. During the process of deposition in 
the lake bottom, organic matter is subject to micro- 
bial reworking, with the result that tts original com- 
position becomes altered_ The degree of alteration 
provides yet more information about past lake en- 
vironments, particularly the amount of water column 
mixing that occurred during sediment deposition. 
Sources of organic matter in lake sediments 
The particulate detritus of plants that have lived 
in the waters and on the land surrounding a lake 
comprises the primary source of organic matter to 
the bottom deposits. Plants can be divided into two

geochemically significant groups on the basis of their 
biochemical compositions: (1) nonvascular plants 
that lack woody and cellulosic tissues, such as simple 
algae, and (2) vascular plants that have these tissues, 
such as grasses, shrubs, and trees. These latter types 
of plants exist on land and in the shallow parts 
of lakes as bottom-rooted, emergent vegetation. The 
relative contributions from these two plant groups is 
influenced strongly by lake morphology, watershed 
topography, and the relative abundances of lake and 
watershed plants. Organic matter in lake sediments 
covers the spectrum of being predominantly algal in 
some lakes to being land-derived in others. 
Bacteria and other microbes in the water and 
sediment of lakes and the soil of the lake watershed 
rework and degrade aquatic and land-derived organic 
matter. Although some bacteria are capable of photo- 
synthesis or chemosynthesis, lake environments 
generally provide enough organic substrate that 
the dominant role of bacteria is the heterotrophic 
decomposition of organic detritus. An important 
exception exists in strongly stratified lakes where 
bacteria can become major producers of primary 
organic matter. Bacteria biosynthesize characteristic 
forms of organic matter while breaking down the 
preformed material remaining from the plants and 
animals of the lake and watershed. 
In addition to these local sources of organic matter, 
winds commonly transport material, such as pollen, 
from sources outside the local watershed. The eolian 
component is typically a small fraction of the 
total organic mixture, yet it can contain distinctive 
components potentially useful to paleolimnetic and 
paleoclimatic studies. 
A budget of organic matter sources to Lake 
Michigan, a large oligotrophic freshwater lake, gives 
an illustration of their relative magnitudes. About 
90% of the organic carbon in the waters of the lake 
originates from algal production, 5% is carried to the 
lake by rivers, and 5% is brought in with air-borne 
particles and precipitation (Andren and Strand, 
1981)_ These contributions of organic matter are sub- 
ject to selective degradation as they sink to the lake 
bottom, and therefore the initial source proportions 
may not be preserved in the sediment record. 
Depositional processes affecting organic matter 
A variety of processes act to alter the character 
of organic matter in the relatively short time between 
its origin and its burial in a lake bottom. Foremost 
among these processes is its degradation during 
sinking. Sediment trap studies in Lake Michigan 
show that only 6% of the organic carbon photosyn- 
thetically formed in the surface water of the southern 
part of this lake reaches the sediment surface 100 m 
below (Table 1). Nearly 85% of the carbon is oxid- 
ized before leaving the epilimnion, that part of the 
water column above the thermocline (Eadie et al., 
1984)_ In more shallow depths, organic matter would 
have shorter sinking times and consequently shorter

exposures to oxidation in the water column. Shallow- 
water lakes consequently usually have sediments 
richer in organic matter than found in deep lakes like 
the Laurentian Great Lakes_ 
Once reaching the bottom, organic matter continues 
to be subject to oxidative alteration and destruction. 
Resuspension of sedimented organic matter can be 
substantial (e.g. 75 g Corg/m2yr at a depth of 100 m 
in Lake Michigan (Table 1), or nearly 10 times the 
annual flux of organic carbon to the bottom; Eadie 
et al., 1984; Meyers et al., 1984a; Meyers and Eadie, 
1993). Organic matter so resuspended is re-exposed 
to oxidation in the water column. Resuspension is 
usually greater in large, well-mixed lakes than in 
small lakes. 
Bioturbation, or biological mixing, of surface sedi- 
ments also prolongs the exposure of organic matter 
to oxidation and adds to this the degradation due 
to the nutritional needs of benthic fauna. The depth 
of bioturbation in the Great Lakes, as an example, 
averages about 10 cm (Robbins and Edgington, 1975). 
By analogy to marine studies (Cobler and Dymond, 
1980), about 75% of the organic carbon reaching the 
surface of bottom sediments is destroyed in the bio- 
turbated layer. Where seasonal or permanent anoxic 
bottom-water conditions exist, bioturbation is dimin- 
ished or absent, because benthic animals required 
dissolved oxygen for respiration. Many temperate- 
zone lakes experience periods of anoxia during 
summer thermal stratification, and the sediments of 
these lakes typically have higher concentrations of 
organic matter than do permanently oxygenated 
lakes. Varved sediments, in particular, indicate little 
or no resuspension and the absence of bioturbation_ 
Once buried below the zone of bioturbation, 
organic matter is subject to alterations by anaerobic 
bacteria. The waters of most lakes contain insufficient 
dissolved sulfate to make sulfate reduction an 
important process. Instead, methanogenic bacteria 
continue degradational processes if the sedimented 
organic matter contains a sufficient fraction of labile 
materials to sustain microbial activity. In general, 
components from aquatic sources are more sensitive 
to the bacterial degradative processes than are 
materials from land sources. Organic matter in 
lacustrine sediments consequently often has a large 
and relatively unreactive fraction of land-derived 
organic residues. 
Less reactive forms of organic matter become more 
dominant as the more reactive forms are utilized

by microbes and by deposit-feeding animals. For 
example, humic substances and lipids are less reactive 
than amino compounds and carbohydrates, and there- 
fore become larger proportions of the organic matter 
with depth in sediments of Lakes Ontario, Erie, 
and Huron (Kemp and Johnston, 1979). In heavily 
reworked sediment, only the most resistant forms 
of the original organic mixture remain. Throughout 
this reprocessing, residues of microbially synthesized 
organic matter are added to the mixture, some to 
be modified in turn or destroyed, but others to be 
preserved_ 
The final result of these multiple processes is that 
the organic matter in sediments is often markedly 
different from that which is produced by the biota 
in and around the lake. Furthermore, the amount 
of organic matter buried in subsurface sediments is 
a small fraction of that originally introduced into the 
surface waters. 
INDICATORS OF SOURCES AND ALTERATIONS OF 
TOTAL ORGANIC MATI'ER IN LAKE SEDIMENTS 
Organic carbon stable isotopes 
Most photosynthetic plants incorporate carbon 
into organic matter using the C3 Calvin-Benson 
pathway which preferentially incorporates ~2C into 
organic matter, producing a shift of about -20%0 
from the carbon isotope ratio of the inorganic carbon 
pool. Some plants use the C4 Hatch-Slack pathway, 
and others, mostly succulents, utilize the CAM 
(crassulacean acid metabolism) pathway. The isotope 
shift for the C4 pathway is -8 to - 12%0; that of the 
CAM pathway can vary from - 10 to -20%0. Organic 
matter produced from atmospheric CO2 by land 
plants using the C3 pathway consequently has an 
average 6 ~3C (PDB) value of ca-28%0 and by those 
using the C4 pathway ca- 14%0 (cf. O'Leary, 1988). 
Lake-derived organic matter is normally isotopically 
indistinguishable from organic matter from the sur- 
rounding watershed (Table 2), except under special 
conditions as seen later. 
The existence of the several isotopic signatures of 
photosynthetically fixed organic carbon would seem 
to offer opportunities to trace sources of organic 
matter in lacustrine food webs and to lake sediments. 
In the sedimentary organic matter of most lakes, 
however, the differences originally present in the total 
carbon isotopic contents of specific flora are lost 
because of food web integration of the different carbon 
sources. For example, photosynthesizers living in 
Fayetteville Green Lake, New York, have 6"C (PDB) 
values ranging from -15 to -41%0. Despite this 
range among available food sources, most animals in 
the lake have isotope signatures between -25 and 
-30%0, and bottom sediments have a 6 t3C value of 
-28%0 (Fry, 1986), which is close to the isotopic 
compositions of organic matter from other lakes 
(Table 2). 
Microbial reworking of organic matter during 
early diagenesis can potentially modify its bulk 
carbon isotopic content. Organic matter is a mixture 
of different types of compounds which deviate differ- 
ently in isotopic content from the inorganic carbon 
pool. Amino acids of marine plankton, for example, 
are depleted in 13C by - 17%0 on average, whereas the 
lipid fraction has a 6~3C value of -28%0 (Degens, 
1969). Selective loss of more reactive fractions of the 
total organic matter may create a diagenetic shift in 
the isotope ratio which will mask the original source 
signature. Laboratory decomposition of the C4 marsh 
grass, Spartina alterniflora, produced progressive 
losses of isotopically heavy organic material which 
created an extrapolated isotope shift in bulk organic 
carbon from - 13 to - 17%0 (Benner et al., 1987). An 
equivalent shift to lighter carbon isotope values has

Fig. I. Organic carbon concentrations, isotope values, and compositions at different depths in a sediment 
core from Mangrove Lake, Bermuda. Isotope ratios are relative to the PDB standard. Organic carbon 
fractions are proteins (0), lipids (*), carbohydrates (A), and humin (©)_ Concentrations of the different 
fractions are expressed as percentage contributions of carbon to the total organic carbon. The increasing 
contribution of humin carbon represents decreases in contributions of the other fractions with progress- 
ively greater sediment age, which is less than 40t)0 years old. Data are from Hatcher et al. (1982, 1984). 
been documented in an organic-carbon-rich sediment 
core from Mangrove Lake, Bermuda (Hatcher et al., 
1982). The 6 =3C ratio of total organic carbon changes 
from -17%o in surface sediments to -21%o in sedi- 
ments below 5 m, a depth corresponding to ca 4000 yr 
ago, as organic carbon concentrations increase from 
20 to 28% (Fig. 1). This shift apparently is caused at 
least partly by selective loss of the isotopically heavy 
carbohydrate fraction of total organic matter (Spiker 
and Hatcher, 1984), but changes in the proportion of 
land-derived and marine-derived organic matter may 
also contribute to it. 
Organic carbon isotope ratios do not seem to dis- 
play diagenetic shifts in lake sediments having more 
typical carbon concentrations. In a core from Lake 
Michigan, for example, 6"C values remained at 
-26%0 from modern to 3500-yr old sediments in 
which organic carbonconcentrations varied between 
1 and 3% (Rea et al., 1980). If the possibility of 
diagenetic effects can be determined, then differences 
between ~ J~C values of sediments deposited at different 
times can provide paleoenvironmental information. 
The history of productivity enhancement of Lake 
Ontario is recorded by a shift in organic carbon 613C 
values from -27%0 in sediments deposited in the 
mid 1800s to -25%0 in sediments from 1970 to 1980 
(Schelske and Hodeli, 1991). Periods of dessication of 
Walker Lake, Nevada, created shifts in the overall 
carbon isotopic contents of this saline lake which are 
preserved as heavier organic matter 6~3C values in 
sediments from 2 and 5 Kya (Benson et al., 1991). 
Similarly, Talbot and Johannessen (1992) have docu- 
mented organic carbon 6'3C shifts to heavier values 
in sediments of Lake Bosumtwi, Ghana, that were 
deposited under the drier conditions that evidently 
existed near the end of the last glacial maximum 
25-10 Kya. Organic matter synthesized by aquatic 
organisms records times when the waters of both 
Walker Lake and Lake Bosumtwi were concentrated 
by evaporation and consequently saltier. Episodes 
of extensive recycling of organic matter within the 
water column can produce algal organic matter which 
is isotopically light (e.g Rau, 1978), again illustrat- 
ing some of the potential paleolimnologic value of 
organic carbon isotopes. 
Nitrogen stable isotopes 
The nitrogen isotope contents of sediment organic 
matter have not been widely studied by organic geo- 
chemists, yet important paleolimnological information 
about organic matter source and diagenesis can be 
obtained from ~ JSN measurements. Inorganic nitrogen 
reservoirs available to land plants and aquatic plants 
differ in their isotopic contents_ Dissolved nitrate has 
an isotope ratio of +7 to + 10%0, whereas atmos- 
pheric molecular nitrogen has a 6 ~SN of about 0%00 
(cf. Peters et al., 1978). This difference is preserved in 
the isotopic contents of plankton (c515N of + 8%0) and 
C3 land plants (5 ~SN of + 1%o) and has been used to 
trace food chain relationships in a coastal marine 
marsh by Peterson et al. (1985). 
The few investigations of the nitrogen isotope 
content of lake sediments show that the source 
information derived from the difference between 
atmospheric and dissolved forms of nitrogen appears 
to be preserved. The potential isotopic effects 
expected from preferential degradation of nitrogen- 
containing organic substances are minor or absent. 
In sediments from lakes Superior and Ontario, Pang 
and Nriagu (1976, 1977) found that areas receiving a 
large proportion of land-sourced organic matter have 
lighter 6 ~SN values than areas where aquatic organic 
matter is dominant (+3.7%0 vs +4.9%,0). Significant 
amounts of downcore degradation of nitrogenous

matter occurred relative to total organic matter at all 
locations in these lakes, increasing the potential for 
diagenetic isotope shifts. Nevertheless, no differences 
are evident between di tSN ratios in surface sediments 
and those at the bottom of half-meter cores. Most of 
the decomposition of organic matter that might cause 
nitrogen isotope shifts evidently occurs during sinking 
and prior to sedimentation in the Great Lakes. 
Meyers and Eadie (1993) note a change of -1 to 
-29/00 in the 6 tSN values of sinking particulate organic 
matter between the near-surface and near-bottom of 
Lake Michigan. This shift is consistent with postulated 
microbial reproeessing of the sinking organic material. 
The nitrogen isotope record from Lake Bosumtwi 
contains major changes to heavier organic ~ tSN values 
in sediments interpreted to have been deposited 
during periods of dry glacial-age climate. Talbot and 
Johannessen (1992) suggest that evaporative losses 
of isotopically light ammonium nitrogen from the 
relatively saline and alkaline lake waters occurred 
during these periods. Land runoff would have been 
diminished in these intervals, hence the 615N excur- 
sions reflect aquatic production of organic matter 
from a modified nitrogen reservoir. 
Organic matter C /N ratio 
The presence or absence of cellulose in the plant 
sources of organic matter to lakes influences the C/N 
ratios of sediments. As shown by the examples in 
Table 3, nonvascular aquatic plants have low C/N 
ratios, typically between 4 and 10, whereas vascular 
land plants, which contain cellulose, have C/N ratios 
of 20 and greater. Lakes for which the contribution 
of organic matter from vascular land plants is small 
relative to water-column production, exemplified by 
Walker Lake and Lake Michigan, show lower C/N 
ratios in their sediments than do lakes receiving 
important amounts of vascular plant debris, such as 
Mangrove Lake and Lake Bosumtwi (Table 3). 
Ratios of 13-14 for surface sediments of the latter 
two lakes suggest a mixture of non-vascular and 
vascular contributions, which is expected for most 
lakes. 
Selective degradation of organic matter components 
during early diagenesis can modify elemental com- 
positions and hence C/N ratios of organic matter in 
sediments. C/N ratios of modern wood samples are 
consistently higher than those of wood that had been 
buried in sediments (Table 3). A similar change, 
although much more subtle, accompanies deposition 
of organic matter. Settling particles in Lake Michigan 
have a C/N value of 9; the ratio in resuspended 
bottom sediments is 8. A decrease in C/N ratios has 
also been observed in soils (e.g., Sollins et al_, 1984), 
where it involves the microbial immobilization of 
nitrogenous material accompanied by the remineral- 
ization of carbon. These changes in the elemental 
composition of sedimentary organic matter are not 
commonly large enough, however, to erase the original 
C/N difference between vascular and non-vascular 
plants. 
Burial in lake bottoms appears to stabilize organic 
matter C/N ratios to further diagenetic alteration. 
The C/N values of Quaternary sediment samples 
from the upper 10 m of a core from Mangrove Lake 
vary irregularly between 11 and 17 (Fig. 1). This 
variation resembles a similar downcore C/N profile 
from Lake Yunoko, Japan, which Ishiwatari et al., 
(1977) interpreted as changes in the source mixture.

was also found by Ertel and Hedges (1985), who 
demonstrated that vascular plant debris isolated from 
a sediment sample having a bulk C/N of 15 retains 
the elevated CfN values characteristic of cellulosic 
plants. The sediment ratio indicates mixing of vascular 
and nonvascular plant debris rather than diagenetic 
alteration. Talbot and Johannessen (1992) similarly 
conclude that selective diagenesis has had no discern- 
ible effect on organic matter C/N ratios in sediments 
as old as 27,500 yr in Lake Bosumtwi. 
Judicious interpretation of C/N ratios can yield 
information about past sources of organic matter 
to lake sediments. Ishiwatari and Uzaki (1987), for 
example, reported a sharp transition in atomic C/N 
values from an average of 9 to an average of 13 at the 
250 m level in a drilled core of sediment from Lake 
Biwa, Japan. They interpreted this change as a 
shift in proportions of organic matter source from 
algal dominance in younger sediments to land plant 
dominance in deeper sediments. This interpretation is 
consistent with a change in sediment types from 
fine-grained deep-water sediment to shallow-water 
sands and gravels at the 250m depth. Another 
example is from the sediments of Pleistocene Lake 
Karewa, India. Several marked increases to values of 
10 or more occur in C/N ratios that typically remain 
below 4 in sediments deposited between 2.4 Myr and 
400 Kyr (Krishnamurthy et al., 1986). Concomitant 
lighter 613C values indicate that land plant contribu- 
tions to sediment organic matter increased at these 
times. 
DIAGENESIS OF HUM1C SUBSTANCES 
Humic substances are operationally divided into 
fulvic acid (soluble in base and acid), humic acid 
(soluble in base but not acid), and humin (insoluble 
in base and acid). Between 60 and 70% of organic 
matter in young lacustrine sediments is constituted 
by humic substances; this percentage rises to over 
90% in older sediments (Ishiwatari, 1985). In lithified 
sediments, the term "kerogen" is commonly used to 
describe the non-soluble fraction of organic matter; 
this material is equivalent to the humin of younger, 
non-lithified sediments. Because of this operational 
and probably geochemical equivalence, the term 
"protokerogen" has been used by some workers 
instead of humin. 
The geochemical compounds grouped as humic 
substances are complex and diverse. As a conse- 
quence, studies of this organic matter fraction have 
traditionally employed general characterizations, 
such as elemental and spectroscopic analyses. These 
procedures show that humic substances, themselves 
products of diagenetic alteration of biogenic organic 
matter, evidently continue to undergo limited dia- 
genesis in lake sediments. Bourbonniere and Meyers 
(1978) used infrared and visible spectroscopy to 
explore the possible condensation of fulvic acid into 
humic acid in a half-meter-long core of Lake Huron

Fig. 2. Fulvic acid, humic acid, and humin C/N values and 
proportional contributions to total organic carbon in a core 
of Lake Michigan sediment. Sediment age is from modern 
to 3500 yr. B.P_ The downcore decrease in organic carbon 
concentration is mostly from diagenetic losses of fulvic 
and humic acid concentrations, producing a proportional 
increase in the relative contribution of humin. Atomic C/N 
ratios are not affected by the diagenetic changes. Core 
location, sedimentology, and dating are described by Rea 
et al. (1980) and Bourbonniere (1979)_ 
sediment. They found no evidence for this conversion. 
Furthermore, overall diagenetic effects are minor, 
inasmuch as H/C ratios of the fulvic acid (ca 2.2) 
and the humic acid (ca 1.6) do not change downcorc. 
The H/C values greater than one reflect the aliphatic 
nature of the Lake Huron humic substances and a 
probable origin from algal or bacterial orgamc matter, 
as opposed to vascular plant material. The 550-yr 
period represented in this core of Lake Huron sedi- 
ment is inadequate for major diagenetic effects to 
appear in fulvic and humic acids. 
Over multi-thousand-year periods of time, the 
effects of diagenesis of humic substances become 
evident in lake sediments. The humm fraction 
increases from 65% of the total humics at the surface 
to 85% of the total at the bottom of a 1 m core of 
Lake Michigan sediment (Fig. 2), a depth corre- 
sponding to ca 3500 yr ago (Reaet al., 1980). Some 
of this increase may arise from conversion of fulvic 
and humic acids to humin, but the overall decrease 
in total sediment organic carbon indicates that dia- 
genetic loss of organic matter continues throughout 
the core and that preferential degradation of fulvic 
and humic acids occurs. Despite evidence of organic 
matter degradation in this core, the 6~3C ratio of 
total organic carbon does not shift from -26.3%0 
(Reaet al., 1980)_ The C/N ratios of both fulvic and 
humic acids remain ca 7 (Fig. 2) and suggest a 
common origin from aquatic or bacterial sources. In 
contrast, the humin fraction has a C/N ratio of ca 15. 
Humin typically has an atomic C/N value of 14-16 
(Ishiwatari, 1985), and this ratio suggests an important 
component of cellulosic land plant material for 
humin.

Comparisons of samples of wood from modern 
trees and of wood that has been buried for thousands 
of years in sediments have been used as proxies 
for the kinds of chemical changes that can occur 
in humic substances (e.g., Meyers et al., 1980a; 
Hedges et al., 1985; Spiker and Hatcher, 1987). 
A consistent observation of such studies is that 
cellulose, made up of aliphatic monomeric units, 
decreases in abundance in relation to lignin, which 
is a polyaromatic macromolecule. Solid-state J3C 
nuclear magnetic resonance spectra have revealed 
that a trend from predominantly aliphatic character 
to predominantly aromatic character occurs in the 
humin fraction of progressively older sediments from 
Mangrove Lake, Bermuda. In this case, humic sub- 
stances convert to less reactive, more aromatic 
material in a period of about 10 Kyr (Hatcher et al., 
1982), largely through preferential destruction of 
their aliphatic components. 
LIPID BIOMARKERS AND THEIR ALTERATIONS 
The molecular composition of the lipid fraction 
of sediment organic matter provides particularly 
useful information about the sources and diagenetic 
alterations of organic matter. Lipids are oper- 
ationally defined as that fraction of organic matter 
which can be isolated by extraction with an organic 
solvent. The term "geolipid" is sometimes used to 
describe the materials obtained from solvent extrac- 
tion of sediments in recognition of the differences 
that exist between the molecular compositions of 
unaltered biological matter and the contents of geo- 
logical samples. In older, lithified sediments where 
the distinction between unaltered and altered lipids 
becomes greater, the term "bitumen" is typically 
employed. 
Lipid extraction of lake sediments yields hydro- 
carbons and the hydrocarbon-like carboxylic acids, 
alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, and related compounds 
commonly having l0 or more carbon atoms. Many of 
these compounds have specific biological origins; all 
of them reflect enzymatic control on their molecular 
structures. Retention of their biological heritage earns 
the name "biological marker", commonly abbreviated 
to "biomarker", for many of these compounds. This 
characteristic makes the lipid fraction especially 
important to geochemical studies, even though it 
typically constitutes only a few percent of the total 
sediment organic matter. 
Several extensive reviews of the lipid biomarker 
contents of young, non-lithified sediments are 
available (e.g., Barnes and Barnes, 1978; Cranwell, 
1982; Johns, 1986; Miiller, 1987). We have selected 
examples of studies that illustrate the responses 
of geolipid biomarker compounds to paleolimnetic 
changes and to diagenetic alterations. The biomarker 
alterations can be used as proxies for the general 
processes affecting all forms of lacustrine organic 
matter. 
Alteration of lipids during sedimentation 
Studies of settling particles intercepted by sediment 
traps indicate that lipids undergo substantial amounts 
of degradative alteration during sinking to the bottoms 
of lakes, so that the geolipid compositions of sediments 
differ from their source compositions. The relative 
contributions of alkanoic acids and of alkanols 
become smaller, and distributions change, in settling 
sediment collected at progressively deeper depths 
in Lake Michigan (Meyers et al., 1980b, 1984a). 
The n-Cl6 and n-Cls acids and alcohols from algal 
material become less dominant, whereas the even- 
chain C~-C30 components from the waxy coatings of 
land plants become proportionally more important. 
Fatty acid decomposition rates calculated from 
sediment trap compositions show that n-C~6 degrades 
ca l0 times faster than n-C30 (Meyers and Eadie, 
1993). Similarly, Kawamura et al. (1987) found that 
distributions of n-alkanes in sunficial sediments from 
Lake Haruna, Japan, were depleted in n-C~7, an algal 
biomarker, relative to the hydrocarbon contents 
of sediment trap material in this lake. Aquatic lipid 
matter is evidently preferentially degraded during the 
sinking of particulate material, probably because of 
the relative freshness of this material. In contrast, 
land-derived organic matter has been microbially 
reworked before arrival in the lake, and only its most 
durable lipid components survive to become part of 
the sedimentary record. 
Comparison of the lipid compositions of aquatic 
organisms with those of underlying sediments shows 
degradation trends similar to those found in sediment 
trap studies. Robinson et al., (1984a) analyzed the 
lipid contents of bacteria, rotifers, and protozoans 
from Priest Pot, a eutrophic lake in the English Lake 
District. They found that shorter carbon-chain 
n-alkanols degrade faster than their longer homologs 
and that sterols having more than two double bonds 
do not survive sinking to the lake bottom. Alteration 
of lipid compositions continues in the sediments of 
this lake, most intensely in the surface layer. In 
particular, solvent extractable lipids become less 
abundant, and "bound" lipids, those that can be 
isolated only after acid or base hydrolysis of sediment 
samples, increase. In several lakes, evidence of micro- 
bial oxidation of n-alkanes, the least reactive type of 
lipid, has been found in the appearance of sedimentary 
n-alkan-2-ones having chain-length distributions 
similar to those of their precursor hydrocarbons 
(Cranwell et al., 1987; Rieley et al., 1991a). Prefer- 
ential degradation of algal components ultimately 
biases the geolipid record of organic matter sources 
retained in the sediments of most lakes. For example, 
Goossens et al. (1989) showed that land plant lipids 
dominate the biomarker content of modern sediment 
from Lake Vechten, The Netherlands, although 
carbon budgets indicate that land contributions 
comprise a small part of the total organic carbon 
input to the lake system.

Changes in geolipid sources vs selective diagenesis 
Geolipid compositions reflect the combined effect 
of original source inputs and selective diagenesis 
during and after sedimentation. Within the range of 
geolipid molecular structures, some are less likely to 
be altered by diagenesis than are others. Comparisons 
between easily altered and less easily altered molecules 
help to distinguish diagenetic changes from source 
changes. Hydrocarbons are generally not as sensitive 
to diagenetic alteration as are oxygen-containing 
lipids. Within the n-alkane fraction of hydrocarbons, 
longer-chain-length molecules are less degradable 
than are their shorter-chain-length counterparts 
and can preserve evidence of source changes. As an 
illustration, the dominant n-alkane has shifted from 
n-C27 in pre-1900 sediments to n-C31 in modem 
sediments of Priest Pot, England, as marsh and 
shore grasses replaced trees as the major source of 
land-derived organic matter (Cranwell et al., 1987). 
In contrast to the long-chain n-alkanes, the short- 
chain components from the algal contributions in this 
productive lake experience substantial diagenetic 
losses. 
The relative contributions of organic matter from 
lake and watershed biota effect the biomarker com- 
positions of lake sediments, n-Alkanoic acid distribu- 
tions in sediments of eutrophic Esthwaite Water and 
Blelham Tam, England, give similar bimodal patterns 
having maxima at C16 and C24 (Cranwell, 1974), 
representing combinations of aquatic and land-plant 
sources. In contrast, the distribution found in the

Fig. 3. Chain-length distributtons of n-alkanes, n-alkanols, 
and n-alkanoic acids in surficial sediments from four 
Japanese lakes. Proportions of the components in each lipid 
fraction are given as percentage of the total fraction. Long 
chain-length components originate from land plants, where- 
as short components are produced by aquatic organisms. 
The productivities of the lakes increase progressively from 
oligotrophic Lake Motosu to eutrophic Lake Suwa, and the 
relative proportions of long-to-short components decrease 
as lake productivities increase. Data are from Kawamura 
and Ishiwatari (1985). 
sediments of oligotrophic Lake Grasmere has a single 
maximum at C26, indicative of a dominance of land- 
plant wax lipid input. Furthermore, n-alkane distri- 
butions provide an approximate record of watershed 
plant types. In watersheds where grasses dominate, 
n-C3~ is the major sediment n-alkane, whereas n-C:7 
and n-C29 are more abundant in lake sediments where 
deciduous trees dominate, (Cranwell, 1973a). Measure- 
ments of the carbon isotopic contents of individual 
n-alkanes isolated from sediments and from leaf waxes 
allows source identifications to be more specific. 
Willow leaves appear to be the major source of the 
n-C25 to n-C29 hydrocarbons present in Ellesmere 
Lake, England (Rieley et al., 1991b). 
Selective microbial utilization and replacement of 
biomarker components affects geolipid distributions 
in lake sediments. The n-alkane distributions of 
sediments in oligotrophic lakes Motosu and Biwa, 
Japan, are dominated by the C29, Cjj, and C33 
components diagnostic of land-plant waxes (Fig. 3; 
Kawamura and Ishiwatari, 1985). The n-alkanol 
distributions from these two low-productivity lakes 
contain dominant-to-large proportions of long-chain, 
plant-wax components as well. The n-alkanolc distri- 
butions, however, are not similarly dominated by 
long-chain, land plant components. The dominant C~6 
n-alkanoic acid in these distributions is ubiquitous 
in the biosphere; it can be found in land plants, in 
aquatic algae, and in bacteria and other microbes. 
Its dominance in these sediments, where both the 
n-alkanes and the n-alkanols record major contri- 
butions of land-plant lipids, indicates that microbial 
utilization and resynthesis of the more-reactive fatty 
acids has occurred. The sediment from eutrophic Lake 
Suwa contains a notable amount of the C17 n-alkane 
diagnostic of algal production, and the n-alkanol and 
n-alkanoic acid fractions are dominated by C~6 com- 
ponents. The relatively small contributions of long- 
chain acids and alcohols indicates that contnbutions 
of land-plant lipids are small in Lake Suwa compared 
to the algal contributions. 
Some lipid compounds appear to be particularly 
resistant to diagenetic alteration in lake sediments. 
For example, Cranweli (1985) reported the presence 
of C37-C39 unsaturated ketones in the sediments of 
three lakes, but their absence in those of three others. 
These compounds have been found in marine loca- 
tions, where they evidently can retain their molecular 
integrity in sediments as old as Eocene (Marlowe 
et al., 1984). Although the specific source of these 
ketones has not been identified in the lacustrine 
settings, it is probably from prymneslophyte algae by 
analogy to the marine source. 
Wax esters are also evidently resistant to dlagenetic 
alteration. Fukushima and Ishiwatari (1984) com- 
pared the molecular distributions of the component 
fatty acids and alcohols comprising the wax esters m 
surface sediments of three lakes in Japan. Those from 
oligotrophic Lake Motosu are dominated by the C24 
n-alkanoic acids and n-alkanols characteristic of land

plant epicuticular waxes, whereas those from eutrophic 
Lake Shoji contain a predominance of the n-C]6 
components expected from aquatic plants and few 
of the long-chain, land-plant materials. The sediment 
from mesotrophic Lake Haruna displays an inter- 
mediate wax ester composition, having the n-C~6 
acid and the n-C24 alkanol as the major contributions 
to thetr respective distributions, The wax esters, 
because of their low solubilities and presumably 
low susceptibilities to microbial utilization, provide 
improved records of the original proportions of 
algal and watershed sources of sedimentary lipids. 
Influence of sediment grain size on geolipid compositions 
The relationship between sediment grain size and 
geolipid compositions was investigated by Thompson 
and Eglinton (1978), who isolated five sediment size 
fractions from Rostherne Mere, England. The lake is 
eutrophic, and bottom water anoxia limits benthic 
reworking of organic matter, n-Alkane distributions 
nonetheless contain small amounts of algal com- 
ponents and instead are dominated by n-C:zT, n-C29, 
and n-C~j, as shown by long/short ratios significantly 
greater than one (Table 4). The n-alkanoic acids, 
however, are nearly equally made up of algal and land- 
plant components, giving long/short ratios of close to 
one. Relatively high carbon preference indices (CPI) 
indicate the biogenic characters of both the hydro- 
carbons and the acids are well preserved. Microbial 
reprocessing of organic matter has evidently degraded 
many of the short-chain n-alkanes and has probably 
replaced much of the original fatty acids with micro- 
bial acids. The degree to which these alterations have 
taken place vary with the sediment size-fractions. 
In general, land-plant lipid character and total 
extractable lipid concentrations decrease as particle 
size dtminishes. This pattern is consistent with the 
decrease in abundance of intact plant detritus and 
accompanying decrease in C/N ratios in the sediment 
fractions_ The trend towards decreasing concentra- 
tions is dramatically reversed in the clay-sized particles, 
which have the highest Ioadings of n-alkanes and of 
fatty acids. The larger surface area per unit weight and 
the likelihood of a greater abundance of clay minerals 
probably provide enhanced sorptive capacities for 
this size fraction. 
Two other size-related changes in the lipid compos- 
itions are progressive decreases in the ratio of indi- 
vidual n-alkanes to the unresolved complex mixture 
(UCM) of hydrocarbons and in the proportion of 
unsaturated n-Ct~ acids to their saturated analog. 
These changes, combined with the decreases in CPI 
values, suggest that the lipid contents of the finer-sized 
particles of sediment have experienced more microbial 
reworking than those of the coarser particles. Finer- 
sized particles settle more slowly to lake bottoms than 
coarser ones, increasing the exposure time of their 
organic contents to such attack. Diminished aliphatic/ 
UCM ratios, in particular, from the finer-sized par- 
ticles indicate the presence of microbially degraded 
petroleum residues, presumably from run-off of 
lubricating oil from the roadways in the watershed 
(Thompson and Eglinton, 1978), although some 
amount of eolian contribution is also possible for 
the smaller particles. Similarly, Meyers and Takeuchi 
(1979) found that finer-grain-sized sediments generally 
contained higher concentrations of extractable ali- 
phatic, aromatic and UCM hydrocarbons and of 
extractable fatty acids than did coarser sediments 
in Lake Huron. In addition, the size of the UCM 
component of sediment hydrocarbons decreased with 
distance from the mouth of the major river in 
Saginaw Bay of Lake Huron, verifying its principal 
origin from urban run-off. 
Alkane source records in lake sediments 
Because of their low susceptibility to mtcrobiai 
degradation compared with other types of organic 
matter, saturated hydrocarbons can record many 
aspects of the depositional history of organic matter

Fig. 4. Concentrations of total extractable aliphatic hydrocarbons in sediment cores from Lake 
Washington in urban Seattle and Lake Quinault in rural Washington. Gas chromatographic traces 
illustrate hydrocarbon distributions in three of these core samples. Carbon numbers of ,-alkanes are 
indicated on the traces; UCM represents the unresolved complex mixture of hydrocarbons underlying the 
individual aliphatic hydrocarbon peaks. Most of the increase in Lake Washington hydrocarbon 
concentrations since ca 1900 is due to the large addition of petroleum residues, indicated by the UCM, 
to a low background of land plant n-alkanes, typified by the Lake Quinalt hydrocarbon contents. Core 
sediment ages shown are from 2L°Pb dating. Data are from Wakeham (1976).

sotm:es in lake sediments. One such example compares 
hydrocarbon contents of sediment cores from lakes in 
the State of Washington. Sediments of Lake Quinalt, 
which is surrounded by a forested and virtually pristine 
watershed, contain low concentrations of hydro- 
carbons which are dominated by the C27 n-alkane 
diagnostic of tree waxes (Fig. 4; Wakeham, 1976). No 
significant difference exists in the n-alkane contents 
of sediments deposited in the early 1800s and in the 
mid-1970s. In contrast, modern sediments of Lake 
Washington, which is surrounded by the city of Seattle 
and its suburbs, have hydrocarbon contents dominated 
by the unresolved complex mixture (UCM) indicative 
of petroleum residues (Fig. 4). Anomalously old 
radiocarbon ages of 15-20Kyr for the aliphatic 
hydrocarbon extracts of modern sediments confirm 
large proportions of fossil hydrocarbons (Wakeham 
and Carpenter, 1976). Furthermore the contribution 
of short-chain-length n-alkanes derived from algae 
is equal to the land-plant n-alkane contributions, 
suggesting eutrophication of the waters of Lake 
Washington. In progressively older sediments, the 
contributions of UCM and short-chain hydrocarbons 
diminish, until in sediments deposited in the mid- 
1800s the concentrations and distributions resemble 
those of Lake Quinalt sediments (Fig. 4). Three 
sources of hydrocarbons can be identified in these 
sediments: (1) a natural, low contribution of land- 
plant n-alkanes as found throughout the sedimentary 
records of both lakes, (2) an input of petroleum 
residues from urban run-off, which first appears in the 
Lake Washington record around 1900 and becomes 
dominant in modern sediments, (3) algal input of Ct7 
and Cl9 n-alkanes which is usually small in comparison 
to the land-plant contributions, probably because of 
selective diagenetic degradation. It becomes large 
only in the sediments of Lake Washington which 
were deposited starting ca 1950, when residential 
population growth led to a two-decade period of 
eutrophication of the lake and large increases in the 
algal production of n-C~7. 
Fatty acid preservation

sediments 
Fatty acids are more sensitive to degradation 
and modification than most types of biogenic lipids. 
Some fatty acids arc more susceptible to diagenesis 
than others; comparisons between different compon- 
cnts can therefore help to distinguish diagenetic effects 
from source changes. 
Thc results of a study by Matsuda and Koyama 
(1977a, b) illustrate some of the effects of diagencsis 
and of source change on the fatty acid contents of 
sediments. Concentrations of total fatty acids and 
of total organic carbon decrease rapidly over the 
top 25 cm of a 150-cm-long core from Lake Suwa, 
Japan (Fig. 5). The ratio of fatty acid carbon to total 
organic carbon also decreases, showing that fatty 
acids are degraded more readily than total organic 
matter. Long-chain components, represented by 24:0, 
26:0, and 28:0 (number of carbon atoms:number 
of double bonds) change little with depth, but short- 
chain acids, such as 15:0, 16:0, and 18:0, decrease 
markedly. The degradation rates of these latter acids 
have been estimated in coastal marine sediments to be 
6-7 times faster than for the long-chain acids (Haddad 
et al., 1992). Shorter-chain unsaturated acids, such 
as 16:1 and 18: 1, have higher concentrations than 
saturated acids of the same carbon chain length in 
surlicial Lake Suwa sediment, but disappear faster 
than their saturated analogs. In contrast, the concen- 
tration of the 24:1 acid appears to experience little 
change with depth (Fig. 5). 
Fatty acids in lake sediments typically originate 
from several sources. The long-chain components in 
Lake Suwa sediments are probably from land plants 
and as such are the non-reactive survivors of transport 
of land-derived debris to the lake bottom. The shorter- 
chain components, particularly the alkanoic acids, 
are products of algal lipidsynthesis in the lake. These 
lipids are easily metabolized by sediment microbes. 
The n- 15:0 and ante/so-15:0 fatty acids arc indicators 
of microbial biomass (cf. Cranwell, 1973b), and they 
represent in situ production of secondary lipids at 
the expense of primary organic matter. Most of the 
concentration changes occur in the top 25 cm of these 
sediments, corresponding to ca 60 yr (Matsuda and 
Koyama, 1977a). Although the decrease in the con- 
tribution of fatty acids to total organic matter (FAC/ 
TOC in Fig. 5) is compelling evidence for diagenetic 
losses of these lipids, it is also probable that there have 
been source changes as a result of the documented 
increasing algal productivity of Lake Suwa over this 
time. The lower concentrations of the C~6 and C,B 
acids in deeper sediments may arise jointly from 
formerly lower production and from diagenetic 
removal. The similar pattern for the Cls acids may 
reflect the presence of larger microbial populations 
in response to larger amounts of readily metabolized 
organic matter in younger sediments than in older 
deposits. 
Matsuda and Koyama (1977b) examined the 
possibility that source changes as well as diagenetic 
changes impact the downcore fatty acid composition 
of Lake Suwa sediments. They compared the sediment 
contents to those of potential source materials, and 
they present several measures of source vs alteration 
effects. The Carbon Preference Index (CPI), devised 
by Bray and Evans (1961) to indicate the degree of 
diagenetic alteration of n-alkanes, can be modified 
for similar application to n-alkanoic acids. This index 
is essentially a numerical representation of how much 
of the original biological chainlcngth specificity is 
preserved in geological lipids. In fresh lipid material, 
odd-numbered carbon chains dominate hydrocarbon 
compositions and even-numbered chains dominate 
compositions of fatty acids and alcohols. This 
specificity diminishes as diagenesis proceeds. 
Matsuda and Koyama (1977b) modified the Carbon 
Preference Index (Fig. 5) to test for the presence

of source changes as well as diagenetic effects. They 
separated fatty acids into their lower molecular weight 
(Cn-C~s) and higher molecular weight (C22-C32) 
groups as CPIL and CPIH, respectively. In the lipid 
content of most plants, CPIL values are high, ranging 
between 12 and ca 100; CPIn values are not as high, 
being between 0.9 and 8, because of the presence of 
long-chain odd-carbon acids in some land plants. 
Bacteria generally have low CPI values, and therefore 
bacterial reworking of sediment organic matter re- 
sults in lowered CPI values. 
The downcore CPI profiles in the sediments of 
Lake Suwa are variable (Fig. 5), and they are lower 
than CPI values of potential source materials. The 
variability indicates that a combination of source 
changes and of changes in the degree of microbial 
reworking is involved. The index for all n-alkanoic 
acids, CPIT, is similar to CPI, in the upper ca 20 cm 
of sediment and becomes more like that of CPI, in 
sediments lower than 25 cm in the core. The generally 
lower CPI values below 25 cm imply that microbial 
resynthesis of fatty acids has been important in erasing 
the original compositions. Much of this resynthesis 
evidently occurred in the upper part of this core. 
A Composition Diversity Index (CDI) was also 
employed by Matsuda and Koyama (1977b) to 
evaluate the possibility of changes in sources of fatty 
acid inputs to the Lake Suwa sediments. The down- 
core CDI values are shown in Fig. 5. Higher values 
below ca 20 cm indicate a greater diversity of sources. 
Matsuda and Koyama (1977b) interpreted this pattern 
to reflect the addition of microbial contributions to 
the sediment contents. This interpretation is consist- 
ent with the downcore CPIs, yet both patterns could 
also arise from increased algal production in modern 
times. Higher concentrations of C~6 0 between 75 and 
100 cm in the core accompany higher percent FAC/ 
TOC, higher CPIs, and lower CDIs (Fig. 5). These 
parameters suggest substantial preservation of the 
record of fatty acid contributions to the deeper 
sediments of this lake. On this basis, the CPI and CDI 
trends may record eutrophication as well as microbial 
inputs. Original fatty acid source indicators appear 
not to have been totally replaced by microbial com- 
ponents in this example, probably because of the 
relatively rapid sedimentation rate in Lake Suwa 
(ca 4 mm/yr: Matsuda and Koyama, 1977a). 
Unsaturated fatty acids are generally more suscept- 
ible to alteration in sediments than are saturated 
acids of the same chainlengths. Unsaturated n-C~6 
and n-C~s acids are major constituents of the iipids 
of freshwater algae, and they are rapidly degraded 
by microbial attack (Cranwell, 1976). In a dated core 
of sediment from Lake Haruna, Japan, ratios of C~6 ,, 
C~B ~, C,s 2, and C~s 3 to their corresponding alkanoic 
acids decrease by a factor of 10 in the upper 8 crn 
of sediment. Little unsaturated acid remained below 
this depth, corresponding to 120 yr of accumulation, 
and consequently the ratios decreased much more 
slowly (Kawamura et al., 1980). The change with 
depth found in Lake Haruna sediments is similar to 
the unsaturated-to-saturated change illustrated by 
Lake Suwa sediments (Fig. 5) and found in sediments 
of Lake Huron (Meyers et al., 1980c). The existence 
of carbon-carbon double bonds evidently facilitates 
microbial utilization of these lipids and enhances 
their degradability. 
Variations in factors such as sedimentation rates 
and degree of lake water oxygenation impact the 
preservation of the relatively reactive fatty acids 
incorporated in sediments laid down at different times. 
Mendoza et al. (1987) reported fatty acid compositions 
of a core of sediment from Lake Leman, Switzerland, 
which illustrate the effects of changing sedimentation 
rates. Concentrations of lower-molecular-weight and 
higher-molecular-weight acids begin to decrease in 
the expected diagenetic pattern over the top meter of 
this core, but they increase in sediments between 2.5 
and 3.5 m deep, presumably because of an interlude 
of higher sedimentation rate. Unsaturated n-C~6 and

Fig. 7. Representative sterol compounds which have been detected in lacustrine sediments. C27 compounds 
(e.g. cholesterol) generally dominate the sterol compositions of aquatic plants, whereas C29 compounds 
(e.g_ sitostcrols) constitute most of the sterols of land plants_ Other sterols give greater source specificity. 
Dinosterol, for example, is indicative of dinoflagellate production. 
n-C~B acids show a similar pattern, indicating better 
preservation during this time of postulated faster 
burial. Ho and Meyers (1993) have postulated that 
similar fluctuations in concentrations of saturated 
and unsaturated fatty acids in a 200-yr sediment 
record from Coburn Pond, Maine, reflect variations 
in microbial reworking of organic matter as the 
availability of bottom-water oxygen varied. 
Rapid burial in lake sediments can dramatically 
enhance preservation of fatty adds. Concentrations 
of total fatty acids increase nearly tenfold with depth 
and the proportions of unsaturated acids more than 
double over the top 25 cm of sediments in Pyramid 
Lake, Nevada, (Fig. 6). The cause of these exceptional 
patterns is befieved to be slumping of deltaic sediments 
as a result of agricultural lowering of lake level in the 
early 1900s, thereby protecting surface sediments from 
the aerobic bottom waters of this lake (Meyers et al., 
1980d). Source changes at this time can be ruled out, 
inasmuch as total hydrocarbon concentrations show 
no enhanced inputs of lipids over this sediment depth 
range (Fig. 6). Near the bottom of this core, however, 
a change to a larger proportion of terrigenous lipids 
and to better overall lipid preservation occurring at 
a depth corresponding to 1200-1400 AD is indicated 
by n-alkane and fatty acid compositions. This is a 
further illustration that changes in depositional 
parameters can be preserved in the lipid contents of 
sediments, even by relatively reactive components like 
fatty acids. 
Sources and diagenesis of sterols in lake sediments 
Sterols and their derivatives are important geo- 
chemical biomarker compounds. The presence or 
oG 2o/7--B 
absence of double bonds, of methyl groups at vari- 
ous positions on the carbon framework, the length 
of the branched sidechain at the CL7 position, and the 
stereochemistry of the substituent bonds create a 
variety of geochemically useful compounds (Fig. 7). 
The structural diversity of sterols and their derivatives 
provides opportunities to infer sources and diagenetic 
pathways of organic matter in sediments. The same 
diversity, however, has presented analytical challenges 
which have limited the widespread application of 
sterol biomarkers in lacustrine organic geochemistry. 
Sterols extracted from cores of lake sediments have 
revealed changes in the sources of these biomarker 
compounds in sediments deposited at different times. 
The sources of total organic matter to the sediment 
presumably also changed, although not necessarily 
exactly in the same fashion as the sterol sources. In 
a study of sediments of Lake Leman, Switzerland, 
Mermoud et al. (1985) noted that epicholestanol 
(Fig. 7) is present in surficial sections of a core from 
an anoxic, deep part of this lake but absent from 
oxygenated sediments in other parts of the lake and in 
older parts of the core. They concluded that modern 
eutrophication of the lake has enabled anaerobic 
bacteria to produce this uncommon sterol. A change 
in sterol source has also been reported for Motte 
Lake, France. Sediments throughout a 6m core 
contain gorgostanol, believed to be derived from 
bacterial reduction of gorgosterol (22,23-methylene- 
23,24-dimethyl-cholest-5-en-3fl-ol), which is probably 
produced by the dinoflagellate phytoplankton abund- 
ant in this lake (Wfinsehe et al., 1987). The deepest 
core sections contain aplystanol [24,26-dimethyl- 
5~t(H)-cholestan-3fl-ol], for which a source organism

is not known in freshwater systems. Both of the sterol 
precursors of the saturated stanols are commonly 
considered to be indicators of marine algae; fresh- 
water algae evidently also synthesize the precursors. 
The absence of aplystanol in the upper parts of the 
core suggests that the unidentified freshwater organism 
that synthesizes the precursor compound no longer 
populates Motte Lake. 
Sterol compositions have been used to distinguish 
aquatic sources of organic matter in sediments from 
land sources. Comparisons of algae and vascular 
plants from the Lake Suwa (Japan) area showed that 
cholesterol is the dominant algal sterol whereas 24- 
ethylcholesterol (/]-sitosterol) is the major sterol in 
emergent water plants and in land plants (Nishimura 
and Koyama, 1977; Nishimura, 1977a). Similarly, 
Rieley et al., (1991a) reported that many leaf waxes 
contain C2~ and C29 sterols but lack C27 sterols. This 
difference has been applied by Nishimura (1977b) to 
infer that the sediments of alpine, oligotrophic Lake 
Shirakome-ike contain largely land-derived organic 
matter, which is consistent with known sources of 
sediments. 
The distinction between algal and higher plant 
sterol compositions has become blurred, however, 
as new sources of biomarker sterols are identified. 
Some marine phytoplankton can synthesize ethyl- 
cholesterols (e.g., de Leeuw and Baas, 1986; Volkman, 
1986), and some lacustrine algae appear to have this 
capability. Matsumoto et al. (1982) have identified 
24-ethylcholesterol as the dominant sterol in sediments 
and epibenthic blue-green algae from saline lakes in 
Victoria Land, Antarctica. Absence of land vegetation 
rules out contributions of organic matter from living 
vascular plants to the sediments of these lakes, yet 
the ratios of C29/C27 sterols (between 1.4 and 7.2) 
mimic those of temperate zone lakes known to 
receive terrigenous organic matter. Dinosterol (Fig. 7) 
is the major component of a group of 4~,-methyl 
sterols present in freshwater dinoflagellate algae 
(e.g., Robinson et al., 1984b, 1987); closely related 
4~-methyl sterols have also been identified in marine 
prymnesiophyte algae (Volkman et al., 1990) and in 
a submerged vascular plant from Motte Lake (Klink 
et aL, 1993). 
Several diagenetic changes occur to the sterol 
contents of lake sediments_ The concentration of 
sterols decreases relative to total organic carbon 
(e.g., Nishimura, 1977a), although not as fast as the 
decreases of linear alcohols or fatty acids (Cranwell, 
1981; Leenheer and Meyers, 1983). Another important 
change is the conversion of stenols, the unsaturated 
biological form of most sterols, into stanols, the hydro- 
genated analog. This conversion evidently begins in 
the water column (e.g., Robinson et al., 1984a, 1986; 
Wiinsche et al., 1987), with the consequence that both 
stenols and derived stanols are common in surficial 
lacustrine sediments. 
The rapid diagenetic alteration of biological 
sterols into their geochemical derivatives implies that 
microbes are responsible. A variety of steroid com- 
pounds have been identified in the surficial mixed 
layer of sediments in Lake Haruna, Japan (Meyers 
and Ishiwatari, 1993). Many of these compounds are 
intermediates in alteration pathways that will lead 
to either saturation or aromatization of the steroid 
carbon skeleton and hence improved geochemical 
stability. Evidence of both reductive and oxidative 
pathways is present, but simple chemical dispro- 
portionation is unlikely in view of the intermediate 
molecules. Instead, the coexistence of both pathways 
indicates that a complex microbial assemblage is 
present in the lake sediments. Nearly all of the Lake 
Haruna steroids are intermediates in the diagenetic 
pathways described by Mackenzie et al. (1982) and 
Brassell et al. (1983), except that a steroid diketone 
is a newly identified compound. Steranes are absent 
in the Lake Haruna sediments, and their absence 
indicates that these hydrocarbons are products of 
later diagenesis. 
Conversion of stenols to stanols and the resulting 
enhanced stabilization of the sterol carbon skeleton 
continues after burial in lake sediments. The stenol/ 
stanol ratio is ca 50 in diatoms from Lake Suwa, 
Japan, but drops to 5 in surficial sediments (Nishimura 
and Koyama, 1976). The stenol/stanol ratio decreases 
to 2 in the upper 30 cm of the 150 cm long sediment 
core and remains constant with greater depth. A 
similar total organic carbon pattern suggests that 
microbial reprocessing of organic matter is largely 
responsible for the decrease in the stenol/stanol ratio. 
Microbially mediated hydrogenation of stenols has 
been postulated to be part of this reprocessing (e.g., 
Gaskeli and Eglinton, 1976; Nishimura and Koyama, 
1977; Reed, 1977; Nishimura, 1977b; Rieley et aL, 
1991a). Hydrogenation of the A 5 double bond (Fig. 7) 
yields stanols having 5~t(H) and 5fl(H) configurations. 
Hydrogenation in oxygenated sedimentary environ- 
ments favors the 5~ form (Reed, 1977), whereas the 
5fl form is favored in strongly anoxic sediments 
(Reed, 1977; Nishimura, 1982). An additional factor 
contributing to the decrease in stenol/stanol ratio 
is preferential preservation of the small amount 
of stanols synthesized by organisms (Nishimura and 
Koyama, 1977; Nishimura, 1977b, 1978; Robinson 
et al., 
1984b). Preferential preservation may also 
explain why stenol/stanol ratios of aquatic C27 sterols 
decrease more rapidly in sediments than do those of 
land-derived C29 sterols (Nishimura, 1978; Leenheer 
and Meyers, 1983). 
Sterols and sterol derivatives in sediments provide 
information about lake conditions of the past. Surface 
sediments from Rostherne Mere, England, are domin- 
ated by cholesterol, campesterol, and fl-sitosterol 
(Gaskell and Eglinton, 1976). In deeper sections, the 
contribution of cholesterol diminishes, indicating that 
the aquatic productivity was formerly less than the 
modern, high level. Stenol and stanol distributions 
are the same at each sediment depth horizon, 
although total sterol concentrations decrease with

depth. Stenol/stanol ratios change from 3.1 to 0.2 
over the total depth interval, indicating substantial 
modification from the initial biological material. 
An overwhelming predominance of 5~t(H)-stanols 
suggests that sterol reduction occurred in oxygenated 
bottom-water conditions. Retention of the relative 
molecular proportions nonetheless indicates that 
sterol biomarker information is preserved despite 
overall degradation of these compounds. 
Sources 
and 
diagenesis 
of polycyclic 
aromatic 
hydrocarbons in lake sediments 
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are 
ubiquitous components of both marine and lacustrine 
sediments (e.g., Laflamme and Hites, 1978; Hites 
et al_, 1980), yet these compounds do not occur 
naturally in organisms. PAHs are produced by dia- 
genesis and not by biosynthesis. Individual PAHs are 
created by one of three processes: (1) early diagenesis 
from biogenic precursors, (2) later diagenesis over long 
periods of geological time, and (3) high-temperature 
processes which reconstitute organic matter fragments 
into characteristic PAH distributions. Nearly all 
PAH molecules fit into one of these three categories 
(e.g., Wakeham et al., 1980a, b; Tan and Heit, 1981; 
Furlong et al., 1987), making these compounds 
especially useful as indicators of geochemical transport 
and transformation processes. 
Sedimentary PAH accumulations record contri- 
butions from the different source categories. The 
sediments of Coburn Mountain Pond, Maine, record 
two types of PAH input (Gschwend and Hites, 1981;

concentration is limited by the amount of precursor material. The pyrolytic PAHs reflect the historical 
combustion of coal. The three PAHs having postulated precursors are evidently formed quickly by 
diagenesis in surface sediments and not in deeper sediments. Data are from Tan and Heit (1981).

FORMATION 
Fig. 10. Postulated diagenetic pathways for the formation of retene, hydrochrysenes, and hydropicenes 
in sediments (Wakeham et al., 1980a; Tan and Heit, 1981). Another likely precursor of hydrochrysene, 
but not hydropicene, is/~-amyrin, the isomeric form of ~,-amyrin which differs in the positions of the two 
methyl groups attached to the E-ring. 
Gschwend et al., 1983). The concentration of perylene 
increases regularly with depth in a half-meter core, 
which corresponds to about 200yr of deposition 
(Fig. 8). Perylene is the diagenetic product of some 
unknown biogenic precursor, possibly an erythroaphin 
plant pigment (e.g., Aizenshtat, 1973). Its increase 
with depth reflects relatively slow in situ formation 
via either a first-order or a second-order reaction 
requiring anoxic conditions (Gschwend et al., 1983). 
Surficial sediments consequently contain no perylene. 
In contrast to the perylene profile, concentrations of 
pyrolytically-derived benzo(a)pyrene, chrysene, and 
pyrene decrease with depth after peaking at a depos- 
itional horizon corresponding to ca 1958 (Fig. 8). 
This pattern records the history of coal combustion 
in the northern United States and air-borne transport 
of combustion products to isolated depositional sites, 
such as Mountain Pond (Gschwend and Hites, 1981; 
Furlong et al., 1987). The preservation of this record 
attests to the low reactivity of aromatic hydrocarbons 
once they have been formed and deposited. 
Sediments of Sagamore Lake in Adirondack Park 
of northern New York State contain three types of 
downcore PAH patterns (Tan and Heit, 1981). 
Perylene increases in concentration to a core depth 
of 35 cm, corresponding to a sediment age of about 
85 yr, and then decreases to the bottom of the 75 cm 
core (Fig. 9). The decrease in concentration indicates 
that its older sediments contained less of the un- 
known precursor. Diagenetic degradation of perylene 
is unlikely inasmuch as a similar decrease does not 
occur in the older Mountain Pond sediments. The 
concentrations of the pyrolytic PAHs fluoranthene 
and benzo(a)pyrene are highest at the surface of this 
1978 core and drop to low and nearly constant 
values by a core depth of 15 cm. The pyrolytic PAH 
patterns reflect greater fossil fuel combustion in 
more modern times. Non-alkylated forms dominate 
the fluoranthene and pyrene PAH families, clearly 
identifying a high-temperature source, as opposed 
to a geologically older, low-temperature source (Tan 
and Heit, 1981).

Lacustrine organic geochemistry 
883 
Concentrations of rctene, dimethyl octahydro- 
chrysene, and trimethyl tetrahydropicene vary little 
over the Sagamore Lake sedimentary record (Fig. 9), 
suggesting that these compounds are produced quickly 
in sediments and are the relatively stable products 
of diagencsis. The postulated precursor of retene is 
abictic acid, a component of pine resin (Simoncit, 
1977; Wakeham et al., 1980a). The biogenic pre- 
cursors for chrysene and piccne are not confirmed; 
-amyrin, present in woody plants, is a possible source 
(Spyckereile et al., 1977). Postulated diagenetic path- 
ways for the three types of biogcnic PAHs found in 
Sagamore Lake sediments are summarized in Fig. 10. 
Many of the intermediate compounds have been 
identified (Tan and Heit, 19gl), giving credence to 
these hypothetical transformations. ~-Amyrin can be 
an additional precursor for hydrochrysene, especially 
in lakes having a large fraction of deciduous trees in 
their watersheds, fl-Amyrin is abundant in the sedi- 
ments of Lake Biwa, Japan, and is the major source 
of hydrochrysene in this lake (Ishiwatari, unpub- 
lished). Hydropicene cannot be derived from fl- 
amyrin, however, because the positions of the two 
methyl groups on its saturated E-ring clearly reflect 
an origin from ~-amyrin.

total organic matter (T.O.M.) in sediments of Heart Lake, New York Postglacial pollen zones 
and changes in diatom abundance are shown with radiocarbon ages. The lack of correlation between 
the lipid fractions and the microfossil components indicates that complicated source and preservation 
changes impact the lipid compositions of the organic-carbon-rich sediments. Data are from Meyers et al. 
(1984b). 
and instead concentrate on the molecules released 
by hydrolysis of sediment extracts. Important geo- 
chemical information potentially can be obtained 
from geolipids in which the original biochemical bonds 
are not destroyed during isolation and analysis_ 
A two-step sediment extraction procedure is 
commonly employed to preserve some of the original 
biochemical associations of geolipids. In the first step, 
solvent extraction is done to obtain the soluble geo- 
lipid components. These include truly free molecules 
having no bonds with other compounds and also 
molecules which are chemically combined with others, 
yet can be dissolved in the solvents. This fraction is 
called the "free" or "solvent-extractable" lipids. The 
second step uses hot acid or base to break hydrolyz- 
able bonds, followed by a second solvent extraction. 
These lipids are normally called the "bound" or 
"non-solvent-extractable" fraction. The additional 
lipids obtained by the hydrolysis procedure include 
materials incorporated 
into 
humic 
substances, 
retained in biological detritus, and associated with 
minerals. 
The free and bound geolipid fractions of sediment 
organic matter generally have different sources. The 
free fraction contains a large proportion of land-plant 
biomarker material, whereas the bound fraction is 
constituted mostly of algal and bacterial compon- 
ents (Cranwell, 1978, 1984; Ishiwatari et al., 1980; 
Cranwell et al., 1987; Wiinsche et al., 1988). A 
comparison of the n-alkanoic acid and n-alkane 
contents in sediment from Heart Lake, New York, 
shows that the free geolipids are dominated by long- 
chain components diagnostic of land-plant epicuticular 
waxes (Fig. 11; Meyers, unpublished). The bound geo- 
lipids are dominated by short-chain, algal biomarkers. 
The ratio of free-to-bound geolipids commonly 
decreases with depth in lake sediments, indicating 
either that free components become diagenetically 
converted into bound forms (e.g., Cranwell et al., 
1987) or that components of the free fraction are 
preferentially destroyed. This pattern is not uni- 
versally found, however (e.g., Meyers et al., 1984b; 
Wiinsche et al., 1988). Complicated source and preser- 
vation effects appear to influence sediment geolipid 
fractions. Free and bound geolipids in sediments from

Heart Lake do not show progressive downcore 
decreases (Fig. 12). Bound hydrocarbons are nearly 
always present in this example, even though hydro- 
carbons cannot be chemically bonded to other com- 
pounds. As suggested by Cranwell (1978), the bound 
materials may represent the contents of intact bio- 
logical debris and therefore may be strongly influ- 
enced by fluctuations in preservational conditions• 
Intact esterified geolipids are a specific type of 
bound material that has been studied for biomarker 
source information. Compositions of fatty acid 
esters of alkanols, sterols, and triterpenols isolated 
from lake sediments as old as 50 Kyr indicate that 
the ester linkage, combined with the high molecular 
weights of the esters, enhances the resistance of 
bound lipids to microbial attack (Cranwell, 1986; 
Cranwell and Volkman, 1981)• These ester-linked 
biomarker compounds consequently retain evidence 
of their respective algal or vascular plant origins• 
Bacterial biomarkers constitute little of the ester 
fraction, principally because these organisms do not 
synthesize large amounts of esters. Selective losses 
of lower-molecular-weight esters have nonetheless 
been inferred from surprisingly low contributions 
of algal ester biomarkers in sediments of Tokyo Bay 
(Fukushima and Ishiwatari, 1984). 
SOURCES AND ALTERATIONS OF PIGMENTS 
IN LAKE SEDIMENTS 
Higher plants and algae synthesize a variety of 
pigmented organic compounds, principally for use in 
photosynthesis. Some of these molecules serve as bio- 
markers specific to various types of plants. Pigments 
contain chromophore groups, typically conjugated 
C-------C bonds, which absorb portions of the visible 
solar spectrum and give the molecules their char- 
acteristic colors. In addition, many of the pigments 
have oxygen-containing functional groups (Fig. 13). 
The double bonds and functional groups provide sites 
for microbial attack, making these compounds

especially susceptible to diagenetic alterations• Despite 
this lability, a portion of the pigment input to lakes 
can become diagenetically more stable• The major 
types of stabilizing alterations are complete aromatiz, 
ation of the chlorophyll tetrapyrrole ring leading to 
porphyrins and hydrogenation of carotenoid chains 
to form isoprenoid alkanes. These stabilized products 
of diagenesis are found in ancient lake sediments, but 
not in young sediments. The transformations proceed 
slowly. 
The principal photosynthetic pigments used by 
plants are the chlorophylls, of which chlorophyll a 
(Fig. 13) is the most common• The various chloro- 
phylls differ principally in the alkyl sidechains 
attached to the central tetrapyrrole ring; chlorophyll 
a has the diterpenold alcohol, phytol, attached by an 
ester linkage. Chlorophylls absorb solar energy most 
efficiently in the red portion of the visible spectrum, 
which are wavelengths that do not penetrate deeply 
into water, For this reason, aquatic plants have 
evolved different carotenoid compounds which they 
utilize as accessory pigments to broaden the range 
of wavelengths useful for photosynthesis (Table 5).

PHILIP A. MEYERS and RYostn ISmWATARI 
Both source changes and the effects of diagenesis 
are recorded in the pigment contents of lake sediments. 
Sanger (1988) reviewed the factors important to the 
accumulation of pigments in lacustrine sediments. 
In general, lakes having higher aquatic productivities 
contain greater proportions of pigments in their 
sedimented organic matter (e.g., Gorham et aL, 1974; 
Gorham and Sanger, 1976). Land-derived pigments 
do not typically survive transport to lakes. Even 
lake-derived pigments are rapidly degraded if they are 
not quickly carried to the lake bottom; Carpenter 
et al. (1986) found that photodegradation of chloro- 
phyll derivatives was virtually complete after only 
three days in the photic zones of three lakes in 
southern Michigan. Increased grazing by zooplankton, 
which leads to more rapid sedimentation, appears to 
be the major factor in enhancing preservation of pig- 
ments and their derivatives in lacustrine sediments 
(e.g., Leavitt et al., 1989). After incorporation in lake 
sediments, pigments continue to undergo diagenesis. 
Keely and Brereton (1986) documented the progressive 
conversion of cholorophylls a and b into pheophytins 
a and b in a core representing a 100 yr accumulation 
of sediment in Priest Pot, England. The dominance 
of pheophytins, the de-metallized versions of chloro- 
phylls, rather than pheophorbides, in which both 
magnesium and ester sidechains are lost, probably 
results from the absence of abundant grazing zoo- 
plankton in this eutrophic lake. The interaction of 
source and preservation factors is complex. Similar 
changes in the proportions of chlorophyll and 
carotenoid components of total organic matter in 
sediments from Brown Pond, Ohio, suggest that both 
production and preservation are linked (Fig. 14), 
although a progressive diagenetic effect for these 
reactive materials is not obvious. 
Changes in algal populations can be recorded in 
pigment compositions. Progressive eutrophication 
of Esthwaite Water in the English Lake District is 
documented by increases in sediment concentrations 
of the carotenoid pigments characteristic of cyano- 
phytes (Fig. 15). Diminished concentrations in the 
uppermost, most eutrophic sediments may result from 
replacement of cyanophytes by other algae (Griffiths, 
1978), or this decrease may be due to a preservational 
effect. A related history of the development of 
eutrophication in Zfirichsee, Switzerland, has been 
described from the pigments contained in a century- 
long core of sediment (Zfillig, 1981). In this case, 
10 different pigment groups were utilized to identify 
changes in algal populations as lake conditions 
changed. Although their multiple double bonds make 
them reactive compounds, pigments can be sufficiently 
preserved in sediments to record paleolimnological 
conditions extending back thousands of years. Pig- 
ments in the sediments of Kirchner Bog, Minnesota, 
for example, contain a history of postglacial plant 
succession spanning nearly 14Kyr (Sanger and 
Gorham, 1972).

all vascular plants grow on land, and therefore these 
compounds record contributions of land-derived 
organic matter to sediments. Gymnosperms (non- 
flowering plants) and angiosperms (flowering plants) 
synthesize different types of lignin, so past changes in 
watershed vegetation can be inferred from the lignin 
contents of sediments. Lignin is relatively resistant to 
diagenesis, making its sedimentary record longer-lived 
than many other forms of primary organic matter. 
Because lignin is a polymer, its characterization 
typically involves oxidative depolymerization to 
release various phenolic aldehyde, ketone, and acid 
monomers like those illustrated in Fig. 16. Monomers 
have been grouped by Hedges and Mann (1979) to 
identify the general vascular plant sources of sedi- 
mentary lignins (Fig. 17). The sum of p-coumaric

and the Ad/A1 ratio for vanillyl phenols from sediments of 
Lake Biwa, Japan. The T Bed is a continuously deposited 
deepwater clay layer representing the last 430 Kyr of lake 
history. Decrease in the lignin/TOC ratio indicates gradual 
degradation of lignin. Variations in organic matter par- 
ameters in the S and g Beds reflect varying inputs under 
shallow-water depositional conditions_ The sediment is 
dated at 2.4 Myr at a core depth of 681 m. Data are from 
lshiwatari and Uzaki (1987). 
acid plus ferulic acid concentrations divided by the 
sum of the three vanillyl phenols gives the C/V ratio, 
a measure of the relative contributions of woody and 
non-woody plant tissues. The sum of the amounts of 
the three syringyi phenols divided by the sum of the 
vanillyl phenols is the S/V ratio, which distinguishes 
between gymnosperm and angiosperm sources of plant 
tissues. Oxidative diagenesis of iignin components can 
be inferred from an increase in the total acid phenols 
relative to the total aldehyde phenols, expressed as 
the Ad/AI ratio (Hedges et al., 1982; Ertel and Hedges, 
1984). 
A drilled core of sediment from Lake Biwa, Japan, 
has provided a unique opportunity to investigate the 
record of lignin source and diagenetic changes over 
a long period of time. The core was obtained during 
1982-1983, and 430 Kya is the extrapolated basal age 
of the T Bed, a continuous sedimentary unit repre- 
senting lake conditions similar to the present (Meyers 
et al., 1993). Lignin contents were characterized in the 
T Bed and the underlying S and R Beds by Ishiwatari 
and Uzaki (1987). The latter two beds are discontinu- 
ous and represent shallow-water or fluvial conditions; 
a fission-track age at 681 m in the R Bed is 2.4 My 
(Takemura, 1990). 
Accumulation of organic matter was fairly uniform 
over the entire history of the T Bed; organic carbon 
concentrations are generally between 0.5 and 1%, 
and C/N ratios remain about 10 (Fig. 18). In the 
coarser S and R Beds, organic carbon values are 
slightly lower, and the higher C/N ratios indicate a 
greater proportion of land-plant matter. The contri- 
bution of lignin to the total organic matter drops 
steadily with depth in the T Bed, evidently because 
of diagenesis, inasmuch as the S/V and C/V ratios 
indicate that the lignin composition does not change. 
Ishiwatari and Uzaki (1987) calculated a lignin half- 
life of 400 Kyr on the assumption that in situ degrad- 
ation is responsible for this decrease. Their value is 
based on an earlier estimate of a basal age of 600 Kyr 
for the T Bed; a recalculated half-life is 300 Kyr_ 
These values indicate the potential longevity of lignins 
in lacustrine sediments. 
An increase in the ratio of vanillic acid to vanillin 
(Ad/Al)v indicates that selective diagenesis of lignin 
components occurs in Lake Biwa sediments (Fig. 18). 
Vaniilic acid is the more oxidized component in this 
ratio; its increase suggests continued oxidative degrad- 
ation of lignins. Furthermore, the (Ad/AI)~ ratio is 
above 0.5 throughout the core, which is substantially 
higher than in fresh plant material (0.15: Hedges et al., 
1982). The elevated (Ad/Al), values indicate that the 
lignins delivered to Lake Biwa have been extensively 
oxidized prior to deposition. In wood buried in sedi- 
ments for up to 25 Kyr, as much as 30% of the original 
syringyl phenols can be lost from lignins, whereas 
vanillyl components are preserved better (Hedges 
et al., 1985). Although these types of selective diagen- 
esis can jeopardize source identification, the low S/V 
ratios in Lake Biwa sediments agree with pollen data

and indicate a dominance of gymnosperm sources 
of organic matter to these sediments (Ishiwatari and 
Uzaki, 1987). 
DIAGENESIS OF CARBOHYDRATES AND PROTEINS 
IN LAKE SEDIMENTS 
Carbohydrates and proteins are two important 
types of biologically synthesized organic matter. 
Carbohydrates encompass simple sugars, which are 
water-soluble and reactwe compounds, and complex 
sugars having high molecular weights, which are 
consequently relatively insoluble and less reactive. 
The simple sugars are both produced and destroyed 
rapidly within sediment microcosms, with the result 
that the source and alteration pathways of these 
carbohydrate forms are difficult to decipher. Proteins, 
made up of amino acid units, can be similarly reactive. 
Interconversion between different amino acids is 
common, again obscuring information about source 
and diagenesis. Both carbohydrate and protein com- 
pounds decrease relative to total organic carbon 
in sediments of Mangrove Lake (Fig. 1) and in 
general appear to decompose rapidly in lacustrine 
sediments (cf. Kemp and Johnston, 1979; Hatcher 
et al., 1982). 
Attempts to hnk amino acid compositions of sedi- 
ments to those of likely plant sources have not been 
successful. Casagrande and Given (1980) compared 
amino acids contained in peat deposits with com- 
pounds obtained from swamp grass and mangrove 
trees. Their conclusion was that the bulk of the peat 
amino acids were produced by microbes. Primary 
source patterns had been erased. The secondary 
amino acids, however, were produced as part of the 
sedimentation process and were approximately the 
same age as the peat deposits. 
The contemporary formation of amino acids by 
benthic biota permits their use to date sediments 
through the racemization of the stereochemicai 
specificity of biosynthesized amino acids. The slow- 
acting process, by which the original L-amino acids 
are converted to an equal mixture of L- and D-forms, 
is usually not applicable to lake sediments because 
of their geologically limited ages. In some situations, 
however, it can be useful. For example, McCoy (1987) 
employed epimerization of L-isoleucine to D-alloiso- 
leucine in fossil gastropod shells to conclude that 
some Lake Bonneville sediments date from before 
2 Mya, confirming the antiquity of this lake. 
Monosaccharide compositions of potential source 
organisms have been explored for their potential as 
tracers of organic matter inputs to sediments. Cowie 
and Hedges (1984) examined plankton, bacteria, and 
land plants for distinctive sugar compositions. They 
found that aquatic and land sources could be distin- 
guished in coastal marine sediments. A similar source 
study in two Minnesota lakes found, however, that 
no correlation existed between the monosaccharides 
of dominant aquatic plants and those of sediments 
(Rogers, 1965). Concentrations of total sugars in the 
lake sediments appeared to reflect the amount of post- 
depositional degradation rather than initial contribu- 
tions. The reactivity of even complex carbohydrates 
is shown by losses of 90-98% of the original poly- 
saccharide contents of wood buried in sediments for 
ca 2500 yr (Hedges et al., 1985).

done on sediments from a number of lakes. Indications 
of changes in the trophic status of these lakes and of 
changes in the watersheds around them have emerged 
from the organic matter records documented by these 
studies. Lake Biwa, Lake Greifen, Lake Washington, 
and the North American Great Lakes are examples 
of lakes that have been the subjects of a large number 
of organic geochemical determinations. 
The record of organic matter accumulation in Lake 
Biwa (Biwa-ko) 
Lake Biwa, the largest lake in Japan, has been the 
subject of paleolimnological studies for over 4 decades. 
Much of the watershed is forest or farmland, but 
the fraction containing human settlement has grown 
greatly since the 1950s. The maximum water depth is 
102 m, and the surface area of the lake is 674 km 2. 
The lake has existed for ca 6 Myr, although major 
tectonic reorganizations of its basin have evidently 
occurred (e.g., Takemura, 1990), which have inter- 
rupted the sedimentary record. Organic geochemical 
studies have concentrated on the upper 250m of 
sediments, which is an apparently continuous sedi- 
mentary record of the past ca 430 Kyr (Meyers et al., 
1993). The results of a number of these investigations 
are reviewed by Ishiwatari and Ogura (1984) and 
Ishiwatari (1991). 
Organic carbon 613C values change from -25.5% 
in near-surface sediments to ca -28%0 at 200m 
(Fig_ 19). A progressive change in organic matter 
source or diagenesis is not evident from organic carbon 
concentrations, C/N ratios, or C/V and S/V ratios, all 
of which remain virtually unchanged (Fig. 18). Nakai 
(1972) postulated that the local climate has become 
progressively warmer over the past 400 Kyr, warming 
the surface waters of the lake and decreasing the 
kinetic isotopic fractionation by algae, but the pollen 
record does not confirm this suggestion. The carbon 
isotope shift is nonetheless intriguing and suggests 
that some sort of progressive paleoenvironmental 
change has occurred. 
Several episodes of comparatively short-term 
paleolimnological change are recorded in Lake Biwa 
sediments. Organic carbon concentrations are typically 
ca 1°/0 but rise to ca 2% at two core intervals, 
between 3-15m and 80-90m (Fig. 19). Maximum 
pollen concentrations and heavier carbon isotope 
values also occur at the 80-90m depth (Fig. 19). 
Total n-alkane concentrations similarly increase with 
depth to a maximum between 3 and 15 m and increase 
again at 80-90 m. n-Alkane distributions are dom- 
inated by C29 or C~ (Kawamura and Ishiwatari, 
1984), which are diagnostic of land-plant waxes from 
trees or shrubs ((229) or grasses (C30. 
Possible changes in the sources of the n-alkanoic 
acids in these sediments have been explored by divid- 
ing them into two groups (Kawamura and Ishiwatari, 
1984). The lower-molecular-weight fatty acids indica- 
tive of algae (C~2-C~9) are the first group (LFA), and 
the higher-molecular-weight acids (C20--C32) corre-

sponding to land-plant contributions are the second 
group (HFA). Concentrations of the LFAs decrease 
with depth relative to total organic matter, whereas 
the HFA concentrations peak at about 100 m. The 
agreement between pollen concentrations and land- 
plant contributions ofn-alkanes and n-alkanoic acids 
in sediments between 80 and 90 m indicates that 
inputs of organic matter from watershed vegetation 
were elevated during this time. Meyers et aL (1993) 
have concluded that this sediment interval corresponds 
to the interglacial episode ca 120 Kya and a wetter 
climate than during the subsequent glacial period. 
Important features of the upper 20 m of Lake Biwa 
sediments include peak values of organic carbon 
and LFAs (Fig. 19) and the maximum concentration 
of diatom frustules (Mori and Horie, 1975). These 
features, combined with C/N values averaging 8.5 
in this interval (Kawamura and Ishiwatari, 1981), 
indicate that aquatic production has been the principal 
source of sediment organic matter. Long-chain n- 
alkanoic acids (HFA) change little relative to total 
organic matter, but the C~2-C~9 acids (LFA) decrease 
by a factor of four (Fig. 19), indicating that diagenetic 
losses are severe for the LFAs. Kawamura and 
Ishiwatari (1981) noted that some oxidation of n- 
aikanoic acids to hydroxy acids and dicarboxylic 
acids may occur over the top 5 m of this core, but 
most of the loss of LFAs is from microbial alteration 
to non-fatty-acid forms of carbon. Conversion of fatty 
acids from free to bound forms does not occur during 
the 20-30 Kyr period represented by the upper 20 m 
of these sediments. 
Despite the evidence for major losses of short- 
chain saturated fatty acids, unsaturated acids exist 
throughout the upper 20 m of Lake Biwa sediment. 
The proportion of polyunsaturated acids commonly 
increases in algae as water temperatures decrease 
as a biochemical response to maintain fluidity of 
cell membranes. Kawamura and Ishiwatari (1981)

proposed that variations in the ratio of sedimentary 
n-Cl8 2 and n-Cll 0 acids may provide a lake paleo- 
temperature record. This ratio compares well to the 
proportion of boreal conifer pollen in the sediments 
(Fig. 20). If diagenesis were the dominant factor, then 
a continual decrease in the unsaturated/saturated 
ratio would be present. The fluctuations evident in 
Fig. 20 indicate that source changes contribute to the 
relative concentrations of these fatty acids. The C~s 2/ 
C~8 0 ratio appears to record periods of cooler surface 
water in the history of Lake Biwa, but the ratio is 
progressively diminished by preferential degradation 
of the unsaturated acid with greater age of the 
sediment. 
The record of organic matter accumulation in Lake 
Greifen (Greifensee) 
Lake Greifen is a small eutrophic lake which is 
located in a heavily populated region 12 km east of 
Zfirich, Switzerland. It has a surface area of 8.6 km 2 
and a maximum depth of 32 m. A 6.4 m-long core 
from near the center of Lake Greifen contains three 
main stratigraphic units: a sapropelic mud from 0 to 
60 cm, a carbonate ooze from 60 to 350 cm, and a 
postglacial clay from 350 to 640 cm. 
Concentrations of organic carbon generally decrease 
with depth in this core, but the most significant 
downcore changes are found in the compositions of 
the hydrocarbons in each of the three layers (Fig. 21). 
In the upper sediment unit, n-Cl7 is the dominant 
alkane and reflects the high rates of algal production 
in this eutrophic lake. Concentrations of this algal 
biomarker decrease in deeper sediments and record 
times when the lake evidently was oligotrophic. Part 
of the decrease in contributions of n-CxT, however, is 
due to diagenetic loss of this algal biomarker relative 
to the long-chain plant-wax hydrocarbons (Giger 
et al_, 1980)_ Important contributions of long-chain 
n-alkanes, represented by n-C29 In Fig. 21, are present 
throughout the 6.4 m core. High CPI values (Bray 
and Evans, 1961) of the long-chain hydrocarbons 
verifies that their origin is from contemporary water- 
shed plants, inasmuch as ancient n-alkanes would 
have lost much of their odd/even predominance. The 
dominance of n-C29 at all sediment levels except the 
topmost, most eutrophic one indicates that deciduous 
trees have been the major watershed plant type (cf. 
Cranwell, 1973a), which is consistent with what is 
known of the historical record_ 
The isoprenoid hydrocarbon phytane, derived 
through diagenesis from the phytol sidechain of 
chlorophyll a (Fig_ 13), is found at all sediment 
depths, but pristane, a related isoprenoid, is present 
only in the postglacial clays and in small amounts 
in some samples of the sapropelic mud. Pristane is 
common in most modern sediments and is a byproduct 
of zooplanktonic digestive processing of chlorophyll 
a (Blumer et al_, 1971). Its absence in some modern 
lacustrine sediments reflects the absence of calanoid 
copepods in the foodchains of these lakes (Ha and 
Meyers, 1993). Both phytane and pristane are pro- 
duced from slow-acting d]agenetic reworking of phytol 
and become common constituents of the hydrocarbon 
contents of ancient sedimentary rocks. Giger et al. 
(1980) interpreted the pristane in the postglacial clays 
to indicate that hydrocarbons from erosion of Miocene 
sedimentary rocks in the watershed were incorporated 
into the lake bottom at this time. With the develop- 
ment of forests in the watershed after about 11 Kya, 
erosion became negligible, and pnstane inputs 
essentially disappeared• 
The downcore profiles of the diagenetically formed 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon perylene and the 
C29 n-alkane are very similar (Fig. 21). The principal 
difference is in the topmost portion of the core, 
where perylene concentrations are low and increase 
with depth, whereas the C29 n-alkane concentrations 
decrease from their maximum value• Most of this

airborne pine pollen appear in the core record. Data are from Hedges et al. (1982) and Leopold et al. 
(1982). 
difference results from the time lag m the diagenetic 
production of perylene (cf_ Gschwend et al., 1983), 
and the overall similarities support the hypothesis 
of a land-plant precursor for perylene (cf. Aisenshtat, 
1973). 
An unresolved complex mixture of hydrocarbons 
(UCM) is a major component of the sapropelic 
muds and the postglacial muds, but not the carbonate 
oozes (Fig. 21). UCMs are common in geologically 
old hydrocarbon distributions, such as those found 
in petroleum and in ancient sedimentary rocks, and 
represent a huge variety of diagenetically formed 
hydrocarbons_ The UCM hydrocarbons in the post- 
glacial clays originate from erosion of Miocene 
watershed rocks, hke the pristane m these sediments 
(Giger et al., 1980)_ Deposition of ancient hydro- 
carbons is also evident in the lack of odd/even 
predominance of C~7 C2~ n-alkanes m the postglacial 
muds, as represented by the C~7/C~8 ratios. The 
predominance is high in the surface sediment where 
algal inputs are large, but much lower deep in the 
sediments where geologically old n-alkanes are major 
contributors (Fig. 21). 
The hydrocarbon compositions of the three major 
sedimentary units record differences in the sources of 
organic matter to Lake Greifen. Sediments deposited 
in this century contain a mixture of plant-wax n- 
alkanes, algal biomarkers, and a complex mixture 
of geologically old hydrocarbons. These components 
derive in turn from watershed biotic input, modern 
eutrophication of the lake waters, and a combination 
of enhanced land erosion and petroleum residues 
from urbanization of the watershed. Sediments laid 
down between the year 1800 and about 11,000 years 
ago are dominated by hydrocarbons produced by 
plants in and around the lake. Their n-alkane &stri- 
butions show evidence of selective degradation of 
shorter-chain components (Giger et al., 1980)_ Prior to 
I 1 Kya, sediments are postglacial clays in which geo- 
logically old hydrocarbon mixtures from erosion of 
surrounding rock formations are major components. 
The progressive modern eutrophication of Lake 
Greifen is recorded in the concentration and isotopic 
composition of sedimentary organic matter. High 
nutrient/CO2 ratios in the lake water have lead to 
enhanced preservation of aquatic matter as bottom 
water anoxia has become more strongly developed. 
At the same time, organic matter 5 I]C values have 
become heavier as the availability of dissolved CO: 
has been diminished by algal uptake (Hollander et al., 
1992). 
The record of organic matter accumulation in Lake 
Washington 
Lake Washington is surrounded by the Seattle, 
Washington, metropolitan area. It is larger (surface 
area 87.6km 2) and deeper (60m maximum) than 
Lake Greifen and is presently oligotrophic, but it was 
eutrophic in the 1950s and early 1960s. An l 1 m-long 
core from northern Lake Washington contains several 
layers of different types of fine-sized gyttja deposited 
over a 1.5m-thick layer of glaciolacustrine clay 
(Fig. 22). Pollen and lignin compositions record 
a 14Kyr postglacial watershed plant succession 
(Leopold et aL, 1982; Hedges et al., 1982). Pollen 
compositions indicate that an early pine-dominated 
forest was replaced ca 10 Kya by an alder and fern 
bracken mixture. Since ca 7 Kya, the dominance of 
western red cedar pollen records a cooler, more moist 
climate. A potential problem with pollen paleoclimate 
reconstructions is that pollen can be easily trans- 
ported by winds from distant areas. Lignin residues

Fig. 23. Downcore concentrations of three types of diagenetically produced polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons in sediments of Lake Washington. Perylene is gradually formed in sediments until the 
unknown precursor material is depleted. Retene is formed from abietic acid, a component of conifer sap,

Widespread logging temporarily enhanced the availability of the conifer precursors. Data are from 
Wakeham et al. (1980a). 
are contained in water-carried plant debris, and they 
consequently give a better record of local, rather than 
distant, types of vegetation. 
The watershed succession interpreted from the 
lignin components of Lake Washington sediments 
generally agrees with the pollen reconstruction, 
except for the interval dominated by pine. A sequence 
of four watershed types is indicated by compositional 
changes within the lignin-derived phenols. In the 
basal meter of the core, low S/V and C/V ratios 
(Fig. 22) result from an approximately equal mixture 
of woody and nonwoody gymnosperm (conifers 
and ferns) plant tissues (Hedges et al., 1982). Low 
concentrations of total lignin-derived phenols relative 
to organic carbon indicate that small inputs of land- 
plant organic matter occurred at this time. In contrast, 
C/N values are between I 1 and 15 here and through- 
out the core which suggests an approximately equal 
mixture of land and algal material; these elemental 
ratios are less specific than the lignin parameters. 
Between 10 and 8 m in the core, high S/V and C/V 
ratios record a predominance of nonwoody angio- 
sperm tissues, probably originating from marsh or 
grassland sources. The lignin plant reconstruction 
in this interval contradicts the pollen data, leading 
Leopold et al. (1982) to conclude that the pine pollen 
dominance results from eolian transport from regions 
outside the watershed. High S/V and low C/V ratios 
from 7 to 4 m suggest large contributions of angio- 
sperm wood, a conclusion which is consistent with the 
abundance of alder pollen (Fig. 22). The decrease 
in the S/V ratio while the C/V ratio holds constant 
between 4m to the core top indicates a gradual

replacement of deciduous trees by conifers. This inter- 
pretation also agrees with the pollen reconstruction. 
Hydrocarbon compositions from a core from near 
the center of Lake Washington record a variety of 
environmental changes in organic matter sources. 
Modern eutrophication of the lake and introduction of 
land runoff petroleum residues are evident in aliphatic 
hydrocarbon distributions (Fig. 4). Deforestation of 
the watershed during the past century is recorded in 
peaks m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Fig. 23). 
The diterpenoid PAH retene is derived from abietic 
acid (Fig. 10), a common constituent of conifer sap 
(Simoneit, 1977). Accelerated erosion of soil during 
logging of the conifer-covered watershed of Lake 
Washington since the early 1900s created a pulse of 
abietic acid to the lake sediments (Wakeham et al., 
1980a). Concentration profiles of several triterpenoid 
PAHs are similar to the retene profile (Fig. 23). 
Probable precursors of these PAHs are ~t-amyrin and 
fl-amyrin (Fig. 10), which are found in conifer bark. 
Logging and associated enhanced erosion of forest 
soil has evidently increased the delivery of these PAH 
precursors to Lake Washington sediments, too. 
Concentrations of the pentacyclic aromatic hydro- 
carbon perylene change in a different way than those 
of the four PAH molecules derived from conifer 
precursors (Fig. 23). The typical delay (e.g. Figs 8 
and 9) between addition of the unknown precursor 
and the diagenetic production of this PAH is evident_ 
Absence of further change with core depth indicates 
that the input of the unspecified precursor to Lake 
Washington has remained constant over the past 
3000 yr. 
Comparison of PAH contents of Lake Greifen and 
Lake Washington sediments 
Lake Greifen and Lake Washington are temperate- 
zone lakes that have experienced similar postglacial 
changes in watershed vegetation and aquatic produc- 
tivity over the past 14 Kya. The PAH contents of their 
sediments record both similarities and differences 
in source inputs. In both lakes, PAH compositions 
increase markedly in concentration and complexity in 
sediments deposited since about 1900 (Fig_ 24)_ These 
changes arise from a combination of street runoff of 
petroleum residues and airborne input of combustion- 
derived PAH (Wakeham et al., 1980b). Both of these 
anthropogemc sources have increased in magnitude 
during the last century and have overwhelmed the con- 
tributions of PAHs derived from biogenic precursors• 
Natural differences in watershed biota also affect 
the sedimentary diagenetic PAH contents of these 
two lakes. Sediments of Lake Washington contain 
large concentrations of retene, whereas those of 
Lake Greifen contain negligible amounts (Wakeham 
et al., 1980a). Similarly, pimanthrene, for which 
resin-derived primaric acid is the probable precursor, 
and a wide range of triterpenoid hydrocarbons 
derived from amyrin precursors are abundant in the 
sediments of Lake Washington but not in those of

Lake Greifen. These differences reflect the fact that 
conifers are abundant around Lake Washington, but 
not around Lake Greifen. The perylene profiles also 
differ in the two lakes. After the initial diagenetic 
lag, sedimentary concentrations are constant in Lake 
Washington, but variable in Lake Greifen (Figs 21 
and 23). This contrast may indicate that the types 
of watershed vegetation and therefore the sources 
of the perylene precursor have varied more around 
Lake Greifen than around Lake Washington. 
Organic matter sources and diagenesis in sediments 
of Lake Huron and Lake Michigan 
The North American Great Lakes have large 
surface areas and volumes, but relatively shallow 
depths and small watersheds. Lake Huron and Lake 
Michigan (Fig. 25) are the second and third largest 
of the Great Lakes. Although Lake Huron is larger 
than Lake Michigan (59,530 km 2 vs 57,780 kin2), the 
greater depth of Lake Michigan (85 m average) gives 
it a larger volume than Lake Huron (60 m average). 
The two lakes share a common water mass, have 
similarly oligotrophic ecosystems, and are similar in 
sedimentation processes (cf. Reaet al., 1981; Leenheer 
and Meyers, 1984). 
The large size of Lake Michigan allows study of 
short-term changes during settling of organic matter 
to lake bottoms at locations distant from land (e.g., 
Eadie et al., 1984; Meyers et al., 1980b, 1984a; Meyers 
and Eadie, 1993). Organic carbon concentrations of 
settling particles collected in sediment traps decrease 
with depth while the organic matter bulk character 
changes little (Table 6). The concentration decreases 
found agree wtth the estimates of substantial oxidation 
of organic matter during sinking through the epi- 
limnion and hypolimnion (Table 1). C/N ratios

fluctuate with depth, suggesting that land-derived and 
algal organic matter have different rates of diagenesis 
and that lateral inputs of organic matter may occur. 
In contrast, carbon isotope ratios show little diagenetic 
or source change effect. The ratios of long/short 
n-alkanes indicate more land-derived hydrocarbons 
in the contents of the upper traps at Station 4 and in 
all traps at Station 11 in the northern portion of the 
lake, which has a forested watershed. Estimates of 
downward fluxes of n-alkanoic acids and n-alkanes in 
traps at two depths indicates that degradation of the 
acids occurs ten times faster than for hydrocarbons 
(Meyers and Eadie, 1993). As concluded by Meyers 
et al. (1984a), the changes occurring to the organic 
matter contents of settling particles are complex, 
yet information about sources remains evident. 
The sedimentary record in the Great Lakes dates

concentrations, n-C29/n-C~7 alkane ratio, and percentage of unsaturated components of the total fatty 
acids in two sediment cores from southern Lake Huron. The sediments differ drastically in age, and 
consequently their lipid contents are markedly different. The 400 yr age of the basal section of Core 12 
is extrapolated from 2~°pb dating. Core 58 consists of a veneer of modern sediment overlying glacno- 
lacustrine clay 12 Kyr m age. Core locations are shown in Fig. 25. Data are from Meyers et al. (1980c).

Fig. 27. Downcore changes m total organic carbon (TOC) concentration and in lipid characteristics in 
a core of Saginaw Bay sediment. Modern eutrophication of this bay is evident from increases in TOC, 
phytol/dihydrophytol, and C~6 alkanol inputs since 1955. Impact of petroleum pollution is recorded by 
dominance of unresolved complex mixture (UCM) of hydrocarbons since the late 1800s. Core location

level resulting from isostatic rebound and drainage 
channel downcutting (cf. Rea et al., 1980, 1981). 
Sediment cores from sites located close to each other 
(Fig. 25) often contain very different spans of lake 
history and therefore allow interesting comparisons. 
Station 12 in southern Lake Huron, for example, 
provides a continuous record of the most recent 
400 yr of sediment accumulation, whereas Station 58, 
less than 7 km distant, is made up almost entirely of 
glaciolacustrine clay deposited over 12 Kya (Meyers 
et al., 1980c). In general, fine-sized sediments contain 
higher concentrations of organic carbon, n-alkanoic 
acids, and n-alkanes than found in coarser sediments 
(cf. Thompson and Eglinton, 1978; Meyers and 
Takeuchi, 1979). The glaciolacustrine clays of Core 58 
are nonetheless poorer in organic carbon, fatty acids, 
and hydrocarbons than the silty clays of Core 12 
(Fig. 26). Dilution of organic matter by high sedi- 
mentation rates of the glaciolacustrine clays probably 
caused the low concentrations. In addition, the pro- 
ductivity of the surrounding land areas immediately 
following glacial retreat was probably lower than in 
subsequent pertods. Indeed, the low C29/C17 n-alkane 
ratio in Core 58 indicates little land-derived hydro- 
carbon material reached this site. In contrast, vari- 
ations in the C29/Ci7 ratios in Core 12 show that 
the proportions of land-plant and algal hydrocarbons 
have fluctuated repeatedly over the past 400 yr and 
that land-derived hydrocarbons have often been dom- 
inant. Diagenesis of Core 12 fatty acids is indicated 
by downcore decreases in their total concentration 
and in the proportion of unsaturated acids (Fig. 26). 
Both of these parameters are low in Core 58 because 
diagenesls is further advanced in these much older 
sediments. 
Over the past 200 yr, sources of organic matter to 
the Great Lakes have been successively modified by 
replacement of native watershed vegetation by farm- 
land, urbanization of the near-lake areas, industrial- 
ization of the region, and eutrophication of some 
nearshore areas of the lakes. These changes are 
recorded in the organic matter contents of lake 
sediments. A shift in organic carbon 6 '3C values from 
-27%o in Lake Ontario sediments deposited before 
ca 1830 to values of -24%0 in younger sediments has 
been interpreted by Sackett et al. (1986) as a record 
of the replacement of native C3 plants by agricultural 
C4 plants in the watershed of this lake. The carbon 
isotope change is accompanied by the appearance of 
Ambrosia (ragweed) pollen in the sediment record, 
which indicates deforestation of the surrounding 
land area. A subsequent interpretation of the shift to 
heavier organic carbon isotopic ratios in sedtments 
from Station E30 in Lake Ontario (Fig. 25) is that 
enhanced algal productivity is the principal cause 
(Schelske and Hodell, 1991), even though a change in 
watershed vegetation has occurred. 
Sediments of Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron, contain a 
geolipid record of both urbanization of the local land 
area and eutrophication of the bay. Contributions of 
aquatic geolipid biomarkers have increased since ca 
1900 (Meyers and Takeuchi, 1981), and the relative 
proportions of land-plant n-alkanols, sterols, and 
n-alkanes have consequently become smaller (Fig. 27). 
Phytol concentrations correlate with chlorophyll and 
hence with algal biomass (Schultz and Quinn, 1974), 
whereas dihydrophytol is eroded from land and has 
a constant concentration in Saginaw Bay sediments, 
The increase in phytol/dihydrophytol ratio indicates 
enhanced algal inputs (Fig. 27). These changes record 
progressive eutrophication of the waters of Saginaw 
Bay. 
Petroleum residues at the same time become the 
dominant hydrocarbons in the bay sediments. The 
unresolved complex mixture (UCM) changes from a 
minor to the major part of the total aliphatic hydro- 
carbon concentrations (Fig. 27). UCM concentrations 
diminish as distance from land increases (Meyers

PHILIP A. MEYERS and RYOSHI ISHIWATARI 
and Takeuchi, 1979; Meyers, 1984), indicating fluvial 
sources for the petroleum residues. The heavily indus- 
trialized and urbanized watershed of the Saginaw 
River is the most likely origin of these contaminants. 
Petroleum hydrocarbons appear in general to be 
transported in association with suspended sediment 
particles in Lakes St. Clair, Erie, and Ontario. Highest 
concentrations are found in sediments close to major 
cities and in areas where fine-sized sediment particles 
can settle to the lake bottoms (Nagy et al., 1984). 
Western Lake Erie, which receives the discharge from 
the heavily industrialized and urbanized Detroit River, 
has the largest accumulation of petroleum hydro- 
carbons. The sediments of shallow Lake St. Clair (ca 
6 m) contain low concentrations of petroleum hydro- 
carbons (Nagy et al., 1984), yet Meyers (1984) notes 
that UCM components constitute nearly 80% of the 
total hydrocarbons in a 20 cm core of sediment from 
this lake. The organic matter characteristics of this 
core closely resemble those of Core 58 from southern 
Lake Huron, which is made up of glaciolacustrine 
clay estimated to be 12 Kyr old. Radiocarbon dating 
of organic matter m the Lake St. Clair core gives an 
age of 24 Kyr, indicating the presence of a sizable 
fraction of geologically ancient organic matter. Meyers 
(1984) suggests that the bulk of the sediments m this 
shallow lake are rehct postglacial clays and that they 
incorporated petroleum hydrocarbons long ago from 
natural oil seeps in nearby Canada. Little modern 
sediment accumulates under the shallow, wind-mixed, 
and turbulent waters of Lake St. Clair. 
TRENDS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES 
This overview of the organic geochemistry of lake 
sediments would not be complete if it did not include 
some comments on the directions that should be 
taken by future research. Continued improvements in 
analytical capabilities present new, more sophisticated 
opportunities for studies of sediment organic matter. 
Organic geochemical studies have progressed beyond 
the necessary step of describing what is present in 
sediments and have become more quantitative and 
more inquisitive. The question that has always been 
important is "Why are these organic substances 
here?" 
From a principally analytical perspective, three 
areas 
deserve 
particular 
attention 
in 
organic 
geochemical studies of lake sediments: 
1. The types of compounds that are analyzed 
should be expanded from the predominantly low- 
molecular-weight fractions to include many more of 
the higher-molecular-weight materials that constitute 
the bulk of biological and sedimentary organic matter. 
It is now feasible to analyze by gas chromatography 
intact molecules containing up to 80 carbon atoms, 
corresponding to a molecular weight of over 1100. 
Larger molecules can be disassembled by controlled 
procedures such as hydrolysis, ozonolysis, and 
pyrolysis to yield analyzable fragments. 
2. The isotopic contents of organic matter are 
generally underutilized in organic geochemistry. 
Carbon isotopes of bulk organic matter are regularly 
measured, yet the different components comprising 
this material have characteristic isotope ratios that 
are not commonly investigated. Precursor-product 
relationships have been successfully explored using 
carbon isotope signatures of specific compounds iso- 
lated from the Eocene Messel shale (e.g. Hayes et al., 
1987; Freeman et al., 1990), and this approach has 
potential application to early diagenesls of lacustrine 
organic matter. The isotopes of hydrogen, nitrogen, 
and sulfur also contain biochemical and geochemical 
information that is seldom determined. Instruments 
are now sufficiently sensitive to perform these analyses. 
3. Analyses need to become more quantitative 
and to be linked with other limnological parameters. 
Measurements of primary production rates, transport 
fluxes, and mass accumulation rates of organic matter 
in lacustrine settings are important for evaluating the 
relative significances of input, recycling, and preserv- 
ation. Calculations of mass balances are important 
and attainable goals. 
On a conceptual level, several areas merit special 
attention for future organic geochemical research in 
lake settings: 
1. Better descriptions of paleolimnoiogical condi- 
tions can be obtained by wider use of the information 
provided by the organic matter contained in lake 
sediments. Evidence about paleoproductwity, changes 
in aquatic communities, transport processes, and 
watershed vegetation is available. 
2. The collection of useful biomarker compounds 
needs to be expanded. Paleolimnologists can define 
questions that organic geochemists can help answer. 
Indicator organisms, characteristLc of different types 
of lacustrine environments, can be identified and their 
molecular and isotopic composiUons can be scanned 
for new biomarker information. 
3. Quantitative relationships between organic geo- 
chemical indicators of autochthonous and allochthon- 
ous forms of orgamc matter need better definition. As 
an example, land-derived organic matter is generally 
over-represented by biomarker evidence. Identification 
of representative indicators of organic matter sources 
~ifferent types of pollen, algal microfossils, land 
plant debris, bacteria, etc.--and measurements of 
their respective contributions to sediment organic 
matter are needed to provide balanced source 
assessments. 
4. 
Diagenetic 
interactions 
between 
different 
individual compounds 
and 
different classes of 
compounds should be investigated. Most studies 
have concentrated on the changes which occur to 
single compounds or to single types of compounds. 
Dynamic diagenet~c interrelationships may exist which 
are important to interpreting the organic geochemical 
record in sediments. 
5. The different roles played by high-molecular- 
weight forms of sediment organic matter are not

understood well and need clarification. Progress in 
determining the molecular structure of humic sub- 
stances, for example, has been slow. This information 
is critical to defining the significance of humics in 
lake sediments. Does the structure of humin/kerogen 
incorporate and enhance preservation of biomarker 
molecules, or are there systematic alterations of these 
useful compounds?
