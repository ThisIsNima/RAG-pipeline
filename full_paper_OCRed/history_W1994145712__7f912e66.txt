The grapevine genome sequence suggests ancestral
hexaploidization in major angiosperm phyla
The French–Italian Public Consortium for Grapevine Genome Characterization*
The analysis of the first plant genomes provided unexpected evid-
ence for genome duplication events in species that had previously
been considered as true diploids on the basis of their genetics1–3.
These polyploidization events may have had important conse-
quences in plant evolution, in particular for species radiation and
adaptationandforthemodulationoffunctionalcapacities4–10.Here
we report a high-quality draft of the genome sequence of grapevine
(Vitis vinifera) obtained from a highly homozygous genotype. The
draft sequence of the grapevine genome is the fourth one produced
so far for flowering plants, the second for a woody species and the
first for a fruit crop (cultivated for both fruit and beverage).
Grapevine was selected because of its important place in the cul-
tural heritage of humanity beginning during the Neolithic period11.
Several large expansions of gene families with roles in aromatic
features are observed. The grapevine genome has not undergone
recent genomeduplication,thusenabling thediscovery ofancestral
traits and features of the genetic organization of flowering plants.
This analysis reveals the contribution of three ancestral genomes to
the grapevine haploid content. This ancestral arrangement is com-
mon to many dicotyledonous plants but is absent from the genome
of rice, which is a monocotyledon. Furthermore, we explain the
chronology of previously described whole-genome duplication
events in the evolution of flowering plants.
All grapevine varieties are highly heterozygous; preliminary data
showed that there was as much as 13% sequence divergence between
alleles, which would hinder reliable contig assembly when a whole-
genome shotgun strategy was used for sequencing. Our consortium
therefore selected the grapevine PN40024 genotype for sequencing.
This line, originally derived from Pinot Noir, has been bred close to
full homozygosity (estimated at about 93%) by successive selfings,
permitting a high-quality whole-genome shotgun assembly.
A total of 6.2 million end-reads were produced by our consortium,
representing an 8.4-fold coverage of the genome. Within the assem-
bly, performed with Arachne12, 316 supercontigs represent putative
allelic haplotypes that constitute 11.6 million bases (Mb). These
values are in good fit with the 7% residual heterozygosity of
PN40024 assessed by using genetic markers. When considering only
one of the haplotypes in each heterozygous region, the assembly
(Table 1a) consists of 19,577 contigs (N50 5 65.9 kilobases (kb),
where N50 corresponds to the size of the shorter supercontig or
contig in a subset representing half of the assembly size) and 3,514
supercontigs (N50 5 2.07 Mb) totalling 487 Mb. This value is
close to the 475 Mb previously reported for the grapevine genome
size13.
Using a set of 409 molecular markers from the reference grapevine
map14, 69% of the assembled 487 Mb, arranged into 45 ultracontigs

and 51 single supercontigs, were anchored along the 19 linkage
groups. Thirty-seven ultracontigs and 22 single supercontigs were
oriented, representing 61% of the genome assembly (Supplemen-
tary Tables 2 and 3).
This assembly has been annotated by using a combination of evid-
ence. The major features of the genome annotation are presented in
Table 1b. The 8.4-fold draft sequence of the grapevine genome con-
tains a set of 30,434 protein-coding genes (an average of 372 codons
and 5 exons per gene). This value is considerably lower than the
45,555 protein-coding genes reported for the poplar (Populus tricho-
carpa) genome, which has a similar size, at 485 Mb (ref. 1), and even
lower than the 37,544 protein-coding genes identified in the 389 Mb
of the rice genome2.
Three different approaches revealed that 41.4% (average value) of
the grapevine genome is composed of repetitive/transposable ele-
ments (TEs), a slightly higher proportion than that identified in the
rice genome, which has a somewhat smaller size2. The distribution of
repeats and TEs along the chromosomes is quite uneven (see below).
All classes and superfamilies of TEs are represented in the grapevine
genome, with a large prevalence of class I elements over class II and
helitrons (rolling-circle transposons) (Supplementary Table 7). An
analysis of the distribution of the repetitive elements in the different
fractions of the grapevine genome based on the current annotation
shows that introns are quite rich in repeats and TEs (data not shown).
In addition, 12.4% of the intron sequence contains transposons as
determined using our set of manually annotated elements, most of
which (75%) correspond to LINE (long interspersed element) retro-
transposons, which therefore seem to have contributed specifically to
the intron size observed in grapevine (Supplementary Table 8).
In eukaryotes with large genomes, the coding and repeated ele-
ments are distributed over the chromosomes and may be more or less
interlaced, hence defining gene-poor and gene-rich regions. It has
previously been noticed that the distribution of the genes along
the chromosomes of rice and Arabidopsis thaliana is fairly homo-
geneous2,3. In contrast, we observe large regions that alternate
between high and low gene density in V. vinifera (Supplementary
Figs 2 and 3). As expected, the density of TEs reflects a pattern
substantially complementary to gene density. We observe a similar
characteristic in the genome sequence of poplar, therefore indicating
a dynamic for the invasion of TEs that is shared with the grapevine
(Supplementary Fig. 3).
A striking feature of the grapevine proteome lies in the existence of
large families related to wine characteristics, which have a higher gene
copy number than in the other sequenced plants. Stilbene synthases
(STSs) drive the synthesis of resveratrol, the grapevine phytoalexin
that has been associated with the health benefits associated with
moderate consumption of red wine15,16. The family of genes encoding
STSs has a noticeable expansion: 43 genes have been identified. Of
these, 20 have previously been shown to be expressed after infection
by Plasmopara viticola, thus confirming that they are likely to be
functional. The terpene synthases (TPSs) drive the synthesis of
terpenoids; these secondary metabolites are major components of
resins, essential oils and aromas (their relative abundance is directly
correlated with the aromatic features of wines17) and are involved in
plant–environment interactions. In comparison with the 30–40
genes of this family in Arabidopsis, rice and poplar, the grapevine
TPS family is more than twice as large, with 89 functional genes and
27 pseudogenes. Classification based on known plant homologues
reveals that the subclass of putative monoterpene synthases repre-
sents only 15% of the Arabidopsis TPS family18 whereas this subclass
represents 40% of the grapevine TPS family. This result suggests a
high diversification of grapevine monoterpene synthases that specif-
ically produce C10 terpenoids present in aroma (such as geraniol,
linalool, cineole and a-terpineol). Furthermore, the grapevine gen-
ome annotation has also revealed genes encoding homologues to the
two forms of geranyl diphosphate synthases (GPPSs), the enzymes
that produce the substrate for monoterpene synthases: both the
homodimeric GPPS and the heterodimeric form are present; the
latter is present only in plants such as Mentha piperita and Clarkia
breweri, which produce large quantities of monoterpenes19. Most of
the STS and TPS genes occur as 20 clusters, including up to 33 para-
logous genes located in a 680-kb stretch.
Because global duplication events seem to be a frequent event in
plant evolution20, we searched the genome of V. vinifera for paralo-
gous regions by using protein sequence similarity. Paralogous regions
are defined as chromosome fragments in which homologous genes
are present in clusters. Statistical analysis21 of these clusters reveals
that 94.5% have high probability of being paralogous (P , 1024;
Supplementary Table 11). Most Vitis gene regions have two different
paralogous regions, which we have grouped together as triplets
(Supplementary Fig. 5; coverage details in Supplementary Table
10). We conclude that the present-day grapevine haploid genome
originated from the contribution of three ancestral genomes. It is
yet to be demonstrated whether this content came from a true hex-
aploidization event or through successive genome duplications. The
resulting plant had a diploid content that corresponds to the three
full diploid contents of the three ancestors; it may therefore be
described as a ‘palaeo-hexaploid’ organism. A number of rearrange-
ments have affected the original three complements after the forma-
tion of the palaeo-hexaploid state. However, the gene order has been
sufficiently conserved to permit the alignment of most regions with
their two siblings.
We explored the time of formation of the palaeo-hexaploid
arrangement by comparing grapevine gene regions with those of
other completely sequenced plant genomes. If the palaeo-hexaploid
complement is present in another species, it should result in a one-
for-one pairing of gene regions between the two species considered.
In contrast, if another species’s genome evolved before palaeo-
hexaploid formation, it should result in a one-to-three relationship
between the other species and the grapevine genome. The available
genome sequences were those of poplar1, Arabidopsis3 and rice (Oryza
sativa2), of which poplar is considered to be most closely related to
grapevine. All clusters constructed between the orthologues in the
three comparisons have P , 1024 (Table 1c). When the gene order in
poplar is compared with that in grapevine, there are two clear dis-
tributions. First, the grapevine regions align with two poplar seg-
ments, as would be expected from a recent whole-genome
duplication (WGD) in the poplar lineage1. Second, each of the three
grapevine regions that form a homologous triplet recognizes differ-
ent pairs of poplar segments (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 6). This
shows that the palaeo-hexaploidy observed in grapevine was already
present in its common ancestor with poplar.
Poplar belongs to the Eurosid I clade. The sister clade to Eurosid I
is that of Eurosid II, which contains the model species Arabidopsis. Its
gene order was compared with that in the grapevine genome. Two
distributions appear: first, most grapevine regions correspond to four
Arabidopsis segments (Supplementary Fig. 7); second, each compon-
ent of a triplicated group in grapevine recognizes four different
regions in Arabidopsis (Fig. 1b). This shows that the grapevine
palaeo-hexaploidy
was present in the common ancestor to
Arabidopsis and grapevine, and therefore that it is a trait common
to all Eurosids. This is confirmed by the homology level distribution
between paralogues of the grapevine, indicating a lower conservation
than between Vitis/Arabidopsis orthologues (Supplementary Fig. 4).
The Eurosid group contains many economically important flowering
plants such as legumes, cotton and Brassicaceae. Our present results
establish these species as having a palaeo-hexaploid common
ancestor. The grapevine/Arabidopsis comparison also reveals that
the Arabidopsis lineage underwent two WGDs after its separation
from the Eurosid I clade21–24. This contradicts some models based
on more indirect evidence that placed the most ancient of these two
duplications at the base of the Eurosid group, or even earlier4,20–22.
Some studies had also suggested a possible third duplication event in
the distant past of the Arabidopsis lineage, potentially at the base of

the angiosperm radiation. The controversy about this third event is
now resolved by the Vitis genome comparisons: this event corre-
sponds to the palaeo-hexaploidy formation that remains evident in
the grapevine genome but has been difficult to characterize in
Arabidopsis and poplar because of the more recent WGDs. In par-
ticular, the Arabidopsis genome lineage has undergone many rear-
rangements and chromosome fusions such that the ancestral gene
order is particularly difficult to deduce from this species (Fig. 2).
Grapevines, like Arabidopsis and poplar, are dicotyledonous plants
that diverged from monocotyledons about 130–240 Myr ago25,26.
Because rice is a monocotyledon, we assessed the presence or absence
of palaeo-hexaploidy in its genome sequence. The observed pattern is
the opposite of that seen for Arabidopsis and poplar: constituents of a
grapevine triplet are generally orthologous to the same group of rice
regions (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 11). Because rice and grape-
vine are phylogenetically distant, it is more difficult to detect rela-
tions of orthology across the two whole genomes: rearrangements,
duplication and gene loss have affected the gene orders differently in
the two lineages (Supplementary Fig. 10). Even with this limitation,
we observed numerous cases of one-to-three relationships between

their orthologues in P. trichocarpa, A. thaliana and O. sativa. Orthologous
gene pairs are joined with a different colour for each of the three paralogous
grapevine chromosomes 6 (green), 8 (blue) and 13 (red). a, Orthologous
regions in the poplar genome are different for each of the three Vitis
chromosomes, showing that the triplication predates the poplar/Vitis
separation. One Vitis region recognizes two poplar segments because of a
WGD in the poplar lineage after the separation. b, Orthologous regions with
Arabidopsis are different for each of the three Vitis chromosomes. This
shows that the Arabidopsis/Vitis ancestor had the same palaeo-hexaploid
content. One Vitis region corresponds to four Arabidopsis segments,
indicating the presence of two WGDs in the Arabidopsis lineage after
separation from the Vitis lineage. c, Orthologous regions in rice are the same
for the three paralogous chromosomes. This indicates that the triplication
was not present in the common ancestor of monocotyledons and
dicotyledons. The presence in rice of different homologous blocks is due to
global duplications in the rice lineage after divergence from dicotyledons.

rice and grapevine (Supplementary Figs 8, 9 and 11); 23% of ortho-
logous blocks include the paralogous regions that originate from the
grapevine palaeo-hexaploidy. For Arabidopsis, this number is as low
as 1.4% (this difference is significant at 5%: x2 5 8.9; Supplementary
Table 12), despite the fact that the Arabidopsis genome has suffered
many gene losses since its two WGDs. These gene losses would be
expected to obscure the orthologous relations with the grapevine
genome, but they are clearly insufficient to explain the high number
of one-to-three relationships observed in the rice–grapevine com-
parison. The most probable explanation for this excess is that the rice
ancestor did not exhibit the palaeo-hexaploidy observed in the grape-
vine, poplar and Arabidopsis.
These findings are summarized in Fig. 3: the triplicated arrange-
ment is apparent after the separation of the monocotyledons and
dicotyledons and before the spread of the Eurosid clade. Future gen-
ome sequencing projects for other clades of dicotyledons, such as
Solanaceae or basal eudicots, will help in situating the triplication
event more precisely, and eventually in establishing its precise nature
(hexaploidization or genome duplications at distant times).
Public access to the grapevine genome sequence will help in the
identification of genes underlying the agricultural characteristics of
this species, including domestication traits. A selective amplification
of genes belonging to the metabolic pathways of terpenes and tannins
has occurred in the grapevine genome, in contrast with other plant
genomes. This suggests that it may become possible to trace the
diversity of wine flavours down to the genome level. Grapevine is
also a crop that is highly susceptible to a large diversity of pathogens
including powdery mildew, oidium and Pierce disease. Other Vitis
species such as V. riparia or V. cinerea, which are known to be res-
istant to several of these pathogens, are interfertile with V. vinifera
and can be used for the introduction of resistance traits by advanced
backcrosses27 or by gene transfer. Access to the Vitis sequence and the
exploitation of synteny will speed up this process of introgression of
pathogen resistance traits. As a consequence of this, it is hoped that it
will also prompt a strong decrease in pesticide use.
The high quality of the assembly, due mainly to the highly homo-
zygous nature of the PN40024 line, enables the discovery of three
ancestral genomes constituting the diploid content of grapevine. The
Greek historian Thucydides wrote that Mediterranean people began
to emerge from ignorance when they learnt to cultivate olives and
grapes. This first characterization of the grapevine genome, with its
indication of a palaeo-hexaploid ancestral genome for many dico-
tyledonous plants, addresses fundamental questions related to the
origin and importance of this event in the history of flowering plants.
Future work may help in correlating the differential fates of the three
gene complements with phenotypic traits of dicotyledonous species.

METHODS
Genome sequencing. The V. vinifera PN40024 genome was sequenced with the
use of a whole-genome shotgun strategy. All data were generated by paired-end
sequencing of cloned inserts using Sanger technology on ABI3730xl sequencers.
Supplementary Table 2 gives the number of reads obtained per library.
Genome assembly and chromosome anchoring. All reads were assembled with
Arachne12. We obtained 20,784 contigs that were linked into 3,830 supercontigs
of more than 2 kb. The contig N50 was 64 kb, and the supercontig N50 was 1.9 Mb.
The total supercontig size was 498 Mb, remarkably close to the expected size of
475 Mb. This indicates that the PN40024 has retained few heterozygous regions.
Remaining heterozygosity was assessed by aligning all supercontigs with each
other. We first selected the supercontigs more than 30 kb in size that were
covered over more than 40% of their length by another supercontig with more
than 95% identity. After visual inspection of the alignments, we added to this list
the supercontigs more than 10 kb in size that aligned at more than 40% of their
length with supercontigs identified previously. All potential cases were then
inspected visually to discard potential heterozygous regions (aligning relatively
homogeneously across their complete length) and retained repeated regions
(with more heterogeneous alignments). This treatment identified 11 Mb of
potentially allelic supercontigs. We confirmed that in most cases their coverage
was about half the average of the homozygous supercontigs. Only one super-
contig of each allelic pair was therefore conserved in the final assembly, which
consists of 3,514 supercontigs (N50 5 2 Mb) containing 19,577 contigs
(N50 5 66 kb), totalling 487 Mb. If the haploid genome size of 475 Mb is con-
sidered correct, then our final assembly contains only about 12 Mb of remaining
heterozygosity, or 2.6%.
A set of 30,151 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) fingerprints of the BAC
clones of a Cabernet–Sauvignon library29 were assembled into 1,763 contigs with
FPC30, v. 8. In parallel, 1,981 markers were anchored on a subset of BAC clones31,
among which 388 markers mapped onto the genetic map, and 77,237 BAC end
sequences were obtained31. Blat32 alignments (90% identity on 80% of the length,
fewer than five hits) were performed with BAC end sequences on the 3,830
supercontigs of sequences with lengths over 2 kb. The results were then filtered
with homemade Perl scripts to keep only the occurrences in which two paired
ends were matching at a distance of less than 300 kb and with a consistent
orientation. Two supercontigs were considered linked to each other if two
BAC links could be found or one BAC link and a BAC contig link. A total number
of 111 ultracontigs were constructed with this procedure.
Genome annotation. Several resources were used to build V. vinifera gene mod-
els automatically with GAZE28. We used predictions of repetitive regions by
repeatscout33, conserved coding regions predicted by the exofish method34,35,
genewise36 alignments of proteins from Uniprot37, Geneid38 and Snap39 ab initio
gene predictions, and alignments of several cDNA resources (Supplementary
Information).
A weight was assigned to each resource to further reflect its reliability and
accuracy in predicting gene models. This weight acts as a multiplier for the score
of each information source, before being processed by GAZE. When applied to
the entire assembled sequence, GAZE predicted 30,434 gene models.
Paralogous and orthologous gene sets. We identified orthologous genes in
six pairs of genomes from four species: A. thaliana, O. sativa, P. trichocarpa
and V. vinifera. Each pair of predicted gene sets was aligned with the Smith–
Waterman algorithm, and alignments with a score higher than 300 (BLOSUM62;
gapo 5 10, gape 5 1) were retained. Two genes, A from genome GA and B from
genome GB, were considered orthologues if B was the best match for gene A in
GB and A was the best match for B in GA.
For each orthologous gene set with V. vinifera, clusters of orthologous genes
were generated. A single linkage clustering with a euclidean distance was used to
group genes. The distances were calculated with the gene index in each chro-
mosome rather than the genomic position. The minimal distance between two
orthologous genes was adapted in accordance with the selected genomes. Finally,
we retained only clusters that were composed of at least six genes for Arabidopsis
and O. sativa, and eight genes for P. trichocarpa (Supplementary Table 10).
To validate the clustering quality we used a method described previously21. For
each cluster we computed the probability of finding this cluster in the gene
homology matrix (Supplementary Table 11). This matrix was constructed from
two compared chromosomes with genes numbered according to their position
on each chromosome, with no reference to physical distances.
Paralogous genes were computed by comparing all-against-all of V. vinifera
proteins by using blastp, and alignments with an expected value of less than 0.1
were retained and realigned with the Smith–Waterman algorithm40. Two genes A
and B were considered paralogues if B was the best match for gene A and A was
the best match for B. Moreover, clusters of paralogous genes were constructed in
the same fashion as orthologous clusters (Supplementary Table 10).
