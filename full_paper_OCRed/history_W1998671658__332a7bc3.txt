Magnaporthe grisea is the most destructive pathogen of rice worldwide and the principal model organism for elucidating the
molecular basis of fungal disease of plants. Here, we report the draft sequence of the M. grisea genome. Analysis of the gene set
provides an insight into the adaptations required by a fungus to cause disease. The genome encodes a large and diverse set of
secreted proteins, including those deﬁned by unusual carbohydrate-binding domains. This fungus also possesses an expanded
family of G-protein-coupled receptors, several new virulence-associated genes and large suites of enzymes involved in secondary
metabolism. Consistent with a role in fungal pathogenesis, the expression of several of these genes is upregulated during the early
stages of infection-related development. The M. grisea genome has been subject to invasion and proliferation of active
transposable elements, reﬂecting the clonal nature of this fungus imposed by widespread rice cultivation.
Outbreaks of rice blast disease are a serious and recurrent problem
in all rice-growing regions of the world, and the disease is extremely
difﬁcult to control1,2. Rice blast, caused by the fungus Magnaporthe
grisea, is therefore a signiﬁcant economic and humanitarian
problem. It is estimated that each year enough rice is destroyed by
rice blast disease to feed 60 million people3. The life cycle of the rice
blast fungus is shown in Fig. 1. Infections occur when fungal
spores land and attach themselves to leaves using a special adhesive
released from the tip of each spore4. The germinating spore develops
an appressorium—a specialized infection cell—which generates
enormous turgor pressure (up to 8 MPa) that ruptures the leaf
cuticle, allowing invasion of the underlying leaf tissue5,6. Subsequent
colonization of the leaf produces disease lesions from which the
fungus sporulates and spreads to new plants. When rice blast infects
young rice seedlings, whole plants often die, whereas spread of the
disease to the stems, nodes or panicle of older plants results in nearly
total loss of the rice grain2. Different host-limited forms of M. grisea
also infect a broad range of grass species including wheat, barley and
millet. Recent reports have shown that the fungus has the capacity to
infect plant roots7.
Here we present our preliminary analysis of the draft genome
sequence of M. grisea, which has emerged as a model system for
understanding plant–microbe interactions because of both its
economic signiﬁcance and genetic tractability1,2.
Acquisition of the M. grisea genome sequence
The genome of a rice pathogenic strain of M. grisea, 70-15, was
sequenced through a whole-genome shotgun approach. In all,
greater than sevenfold sequence coverage was produced, and a
summary of the principal genome sequence data is provided in
Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1. The draft genome sequence
consists of 2,273 sequence contigs longer than 2 kilobases (kb),
ordered and orientated within 159 scaffolds. The total length of all
sequence contigs is 38.8 megabases (Mb), and the total length of the
scaffolds, including estimated sizes for the gaps, is 40.3 Mb. The
genome assembly has high sequence accuracy—96% of the bases
have quality scores of greater than 40—and long-range continuity,
with 50% of all bases residing in scaffolds longer than 1.6 Mb.
Reconstruction of the M. grisea genome was aided by the
availability of genome maps8,9 (Supplementary Methods S1).
Thirty-three scaffolds, representing 32.8 Mb or 85% of the draft
assembly, were ordered on the genetic map and assigned to each of
the seven chromosomes by virtue of containing an anchored genetic
marker. In addition, 19 scaffolds (65% of genome assembly)
contained more than one marker and could thus be oriented on
the map. The ends of chromosomes were identiﬁed by the telomere
repeat motif (TTAGGG)n. Thirteen telomeric sequences were
placed at the ends of scaffolds, of which six could be placed at the
ends of chromosomes, whereas the remainder were associated with
unanchored scaffolds (Supplementary Table S2). Genome coverage
was estimated by aligning 28,682 M. grisea expressed sequence tags
(ESTs), representing genes expressed during a range of develop-
mental stages and environmental conditions10,11. Approximately
94% of the ESTs were aligned to the genome assembly, despite
many of these ESTs being from different strains.
The gene content of a plant pathogenic fungus
Within the M. grisea genome, 11,109 genes were predicted with
articles

----- Page 2 (native) -----
protein products of longer than 100 amino acids (Supplementary
Methods S2). These predicted genes comprise 48% of the assembly
(1 gene per 3.5 kb). For comparison, 10,082 genes were predicted in
Neurospora crassa, a related pyrenomycete, and 9,457 were predicted
in the more distantly related plectomycete Aspergillus nidulans (also
known as Emericella nidulans; http://www.broad.mit.edu/annota-
tion/fungi/aspergillus/). Neither of these species causes plant dis-
ease. At the amino acid level, M. grisea orthologues in N. crassa and
A. nidulans show an average identity of 47% and 46%, respectively.
Given that the M. grisea genome possesses more genes than the
non-plant pathogens N. crassa and A. nidulans, and that these fungi
are well-studied model organisms, we compared genes between these
species to identify potential cases of gene family expansion that might
be associated with the evolution of M. grisea as a plant pathogen.
Single linkage clustering of protein sequences resulted in 348
families containing ﬁve or more genes. Overall, more proteins from
M. grisea (1,266, P , 0.001) and A. nidulans (1,424, P , 0.001)
were classiﬁed into families as compared with those from N. crassa
(950). An important factor in this comparison is that N. crassa has a
process called repeat-induced point mutation (RIP), a mechanism
that eliminates duplicated genes during meiosis and therefore limits
the ability of N. crassa to undergo paralogous gene duplication and
consequent gene family expansion12. Twenty-eight families were
found with signiﬁcant differences (P , 0.05) in gene content
between the three species, nine of which were larger in M. grisea
than they were in the genome of either N. crassa or A. nidulans
(Table 2; see also Supplementary Table S3). Several gene families
expanded in M. grisea exhibited sequence similarity to proteins that
are involved in fungal pathogenicity13.
Phylogenetic trees (Supplementary Fig. S1) of the expanded gene
families in M. grisea indicated that none of the families showed
evidence for recent lineage-speciﬁc expansion. These gene families
in M. grisea may therefore be the result of ancient gene duplication
events followed by loss of gene family members in the N. crassa and
A. nidulans lineages.
Genome architecture and co-linearity
Co-linearity of chromosome segments (synteny) is widely reported
for plant and animal genomes14, but little is known about this for
ﬁlamentous ascomycete fungi. Analysis of orthologous pairs of
genes in M. grisea and N. crassa revealed no evidence for extensive
regions of conserved synteny, although linkage group assignments
were often conserved between the two species, notably chromosome
7 in M. grisea with linkage group I of N. crassa (Supplementary
Table S4). Only 113 regions containing four or more genes were
found to be co-linear between M. grisea and N. crassa. One example,
also conserved in several other ﬁlamentous fungi, is the quinate/
shikimate (Qa) metabolic pathway gene cluster (Supplementary
Fig. S2). This seven-gene cluster, spanning ,20 kb, which partici-
pates in quinate use and aromatic amino acid catabolism, is
found on chromosome 3 in M. grisea, and is syntenic in N. crassa,
A. nidulans and other ﬁlamentous ascomycetes, but is not present in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe or other yeasts.
M. grisea has a family of novel G-protein-coupled receptors
To be a successful plant pathogen, a fungus must undergo a series
of morphological and physiological programmes5. During these
developmental transitions, the pathogen also overcomes (or sup-
presses) the plant’s innate immune system and perturbs host
metabolism and cell signalling to favour fungal growth. We have
attempted to deﬁne the most important characteristics of the
genome of M. grisea that are associated with its pathogenic lifestyle.
G-protein-coupled receptors with seven transmembrane helices
(GPCRs) transduce environmental signals, by means of hetero-
trimeric G proteins, to activate secondary messengers and regulate
gene expression15,16. The M. grisea genome contains a large reper-
toire of GPCR-like genes, including 61 not previously described.
Twelve of these genes form a subfamily (Supplementary Figs S3 and
S4), and contain a conserved fungal-speciﬁc extracellular mem-
brane-spanning domain (CFEM) at the amino terminus17 that
resembles the epidermal growth factor (EGF) module present in
certain human GPCRs15. Notably, one of the CFEM-GPCRs, Pth11,

is required for appressorium formation and pathogenesis2,18, and
M. grisea has the largest number of CFEM-GPCR proteins among
sequenced fungi. In contrast, only one was detected in N. crassa and
two in A. nidulans, and this type of GPCR is completely absent in
the non-ﬁlamentous ascomycetes S. cerevisiae, S. pombe, Candida
albicans and Pneumocystis carinii, or the basidiomycete fungi
Cryptococcus neoformans, Ustilago maydis and Phanerochaete
chrysosporium (Fig. 2). Moreover, whole-genome microarray analy-
sis conﬁrmed that the identiﬁed CFEM-GPCR-like proteins are
expressed during infection-related development, and two CFEM-
GPCR genes are speciﬁcally upregulated when the fungus
is undergoing appressorium formation, as shown in Fig. 2. Together,
these data suggest that M. grisea has greater ﬂexibility to react to
extracellular signals compared with saprobic fungi. The pathogenic
lifestyle, which involves transitions from plant surface to coloniza-
tion of distinct plant tissues, may therefore require the ability to
respond to a wider range of physical and environmental stimuli.
Virulence-associated signalling pathways in M. grisea
The M. grisea genome contains three mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) cascades that regulate appressorium development,
penetration peg formation and adaptation to hyper-osmotic stress
(Fig. 3). Although there are similar numbers of MAPK pathways in
other fungi (N. crassa has three, A. nidulans four and S. cerevisiae
ﬁve), the processes regulated by the pathways in different organisms
are distinct. Two of the three MAPK pathways in M. grisea control
virulence-associated development. The core of the Pmk1 MAPK
(pathogenicity MAPK) pathway, which regulates appressorium
formation in M. grisea, is clearly related to both the pheromone
signalling and ﬁlamentation pathways from S. cerevisiae, and Pmk1
is able to function in place of either the Fus3 or Kss1 MAPK in
yeast19. In M. grisea, however, Pmk1 pathway components such as
the MAPK are involved in mating and pathogenesis, whereas Mst12,
the Ste12-related transcription factor, is dispensable for mating
altogether. These observations demonstrate the functional diver-
gence of these signalling pathways. Furthermore, homologues of
Pmk1 are required for fungal virulence in all plant pathogens in
which they have been investigated20. The Pmk1 signalling pathway
revealed from the genome sequence is therefore likely to be of
generic importance for fungal pathogenesis.
A principal difference in the operation of MAPK signalling in
M. grisea compared with S. cerevisiae is the absence of a clear Ste5
homologue. A homologue also seems to be absent in other ﬁla-
mentous ascomycetes, including A. nidulans and N. crassa. In yeast,
Ste5 is the scaffold protein that conditions speciﬁcity in MAPK
signalling21. The absence of an identiﬁable scaffold implies that
either a hitherto uncharacterized protein tethers the MAPK signal-
ling module together in M. grisea and provides speciﬁcity in signal
transmission, or that MAPK speciﬁcity is governed by a different
mechanism in this fungus.
Cyclic AMP signalling is required for the induction of appressor-
ium formation and for the turgor-driven process that leads to plant
infection. Until now it has not been completely clear how this cAMP
signal is transmitted. A known cAMP-dependent protein kinase A
(PKA) catalytic subunit (CPKA) is required for appressorium
maturation, but is dispensable for early appressorium develop-
ment19,22. The genome has revealed a gene that putatively encodes a
second PKA catalytic subunit (MG02832.4). Evaluation of this gene
may shed light on how cAMP-mediated signalling operates both at
initiation and later stages of appressorium formation. The Pth11
GPCR also operates upstream of the cAMP signalling pathway in M.
grisea18, suggesting that the CFEM-GPCR family could provide a
number of distinct and unforeseen inputs into this pathway.
Turgor-driven plant infection by M. grisea
Appressoria of M. grisea generate the enormous turgor pressure
needed to breach the plant cuticle through accumulation of up to
3 M concentrations of glycerol. Analysis of the M. grisea genome
suggests that germinating spores possess considerable versatility in
their capacity to synthesize glycerol in the appressorium from
storage products. Notably, in contrast to S. cerevisiae, where fatty
acid b-oxidation occurs solely in peroxisomes, M. grisea has several
genes that putatively encode acyl-CoA dehydrogenases, but does
not appear to possess a gene encoding acyl-CoA oxidase. Thus,
b-oxidation in M. grisea may occur both in mitochondria and in
catalase-free glyoxysome-like bodies, as in N. crassa, which would
allow use of a wide range of fatty acid substrates, including
branched-chain fatty acids23. M. grisea also seems to have the
capacity to synthesize glycerol from the glycolytic intermediates
dihydroxyacetone phosphate and dihydroxyacetone. Activity of
both NADH-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and
NADPH-dependent glycerol dehydrogenase has been reported in
developing appressoria of M. grisea24. Taken together, the apparent
ﬂexibility in lipid metabolism and ability to divert intermediates
from glycolysis may be important for rapid glycerol accumulation
during appressorium development.
M. grisea possesses a complex secreted proteome
The secreted proteome is a crucial component of the ability of fungi
to perceive and respond to the environment. We identiﬁed the
presence of 739 proteins that are predicted to be secreted by
M. grisea, approximately twice the corresponding number for
N. crassa. Part of this difference reﬂects an expansion in protein
families in M. grisea. For example, 163 putatively secreted proteins
occur in families containing at least twice as many members as the
corresponding family in N. crassa (Supplementary Table S5). Several
of these expanded families are predicted to encode enzymes for
degradation of the plant cellwall and cuticle. For example, eight genes
in M. grisea putatively encode cutinases—methyl esterases that
degrade cutin, the waxy polymer that forms the leaf cuticle. Several
of these genes are signiﬁcantly upregulated during infection-related
development (Fig. 2). Previous experiments involving deletion of the
cutinase CUT1 (MG01943.4) led to the conclusion that enzymatic
degradation of the cuticle was dispensable for plant infection25.
However, CUT1 is not among those genes differentially regulated
during appressorium formation. Any of the remaining seven

cutinases may be capable of complementing the activity of Cut1 in the
Dcut1 mutant. Coupled with the absence of cutinase-encoding genes
in N. crassa—which colonizes dead plant tissues—these data strongly
suggest that cutinases have a signiﬁcant role in M. grisea.
Among the secreted proteins predicted for M. grisea, many
contained consensus carbohydrate substrate-binding domains,
consistent with a role in attachment and colonization of plant
tissue (Supplementary Table S6). Speciﬁcally, a role for chitin-
binding proteins in plant–fungus interactions has been proposed
from studies of the avirulence protein Avr4 of the tomato pathogen
Cladosporium fulvum26. Avr4 is a chitin-binding protein that may
act to protect the fungal cell wall from chitinases produced by
plants’ innate immune response. Inspection of proteins containing
the cysteine pattern found in Avr4 and other variant motifs revealed a
novel pattern that is highly abundant in M. grisea. The novel variant
cysteine pattern CX7CCX5C is present in 36 copies of 21 predicted
proteins. In contrast, this pattern occurs just eight times in
A. nidulans, four times in N. crassa, and not at all in S. cerevisiae
open reading frames (Supplementary Fig. S5). This motif probably
represents a variant chitin-binding motif whose abundance may be
diagnostic for plant-associated ﬁlamentous ascomycetes.
Fungal effectors and PAMPs
Pathogenic microorganisms of plants are known to secrete proteins
directly into host plant cells to perturb host cell signalling or suppress
the plant innate immune system27,28. The plant adaptive immune
system has, in turn, evolved to recognize pathogen effector proteins
(often termed pathogen-associated molecular patterns, PAMPs). In
the M. grisea–rice interaction, this immunity is governed by a gene-
for-gene system (one gene in the host conditions resistance to a
pathogen effector protein encoded by a single pathogen gene).
Interrogation of the M. grisea genome for putative effector
proteins revealed three families of putatively secreted, cysteine-
rich polypeptides (clusters 180, 360 and 641) and a protein family
with similarity to the necrosis-inducing peptide of Phytophthora
infestans (NPP1, pfam05630)29. As described above, cysteine-rich
polypeptides are recognized as PAMPs, as exempliﬁed by the
C. fulvum–tomato interaction30. In addition, a novel family of
proteins with similarity to the N-terminal half (,150 amino
acids) of the enterotoxin A chain (pfam01375) was noted. This
region of the enterotoxin A chain contains ADP-ribosylation
activity31, which suggests that the M. grisea protein may interact
with rice GTP-binding proteins. The genome of the sequenced
M. grisea strain 70-15 contains four known M. grisea avirulence
genes: AVR-Pita, ACE1, PWL2 and PWL3. No orthologues were
found to M. grisea PWL1, PWL4 or AVR1-CO39, or to well-
characterized AVR genes from other pathogenic fungi including
Avr2, Avr4, Avr9, ECP2, ECP3 and ECP5 from C. fulvum30, and NIP1
from Rhynchosporium secalis32. This highlights the diversity and lack
of sequence similarity or conservation in the fungal avirulence gene
products identiﬁed so far.
Secondary metabolic pathways of M. grisea
Filamentous fungi are well known producers of secondary metabo-
lites, which in nature fulﬁl a variety of functions probably to allow
for niche exploitation. Plant pathogenic fungi produce diverse
secondary metabolites that aid in pathogenicity, such as host-
selective toxins33. The M. grisea genome displays a considerable
capacity for production of secondary metabolites. There are 23
genes predicted to encode polyketide synthases (PKS), compared
with seven PKS genes in Neurospora, and three of the PKS-encoding
genes in particular are upregulated during infection-related
development (Fig. 2). Beyond containing the ketosynthase domain,
the structure of these proteins is highly divergent (Supplementary
Fig. S6). Most of the 23 PKS genes appear to occur in gene clusters
with neighbouring genes that are predicted to encode enzymes such
as cytochrome P450 and mono-oxygenases, which typically modify
or customize the polyketide backbone to form a functional second-
ary metabolite (Supplementary Table S7). The diversity of PKS
genes in ﬁlamentous ascomycete fungi and the poor conservation of
clearly orthologous PKS genes, even in related species34, indicates

that considerable variability is likely to exist in the polyketide
metabolites generated by pathogenic fungi.
Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), which catalyse pro-
duction of cyclic peptides including numerous toxins, also seem to
be well represented in the M. grisea genome. Two distinct subclasses
exist: those that exist separately and those that are fused to a PKS
(PKS–NRPS). Overall, there are six likely NRPS genes and eight
PKS–NRPS genes in the M. grisea genome: six full-length PKS–
NRPS genes and two PKS-NRPS genes with a truncated NRPS
domain. This contrasts with two predicted NRPS genes and one
NRPS-related gene reported in the N. crassa genome sequence. One
of the hybrid PKS-NRPS proteins is encoded by the ACE1 gene,
which has recently been shown to act as an avirulence gene35. The
large number, and expression proﬁle, of PKS and NRPS genes in
M. grisea is consistent with the requirements of a fungal pathogen in
adapting to diverse environments, perturbing host metabolism and
ultimately causing plant cell death.
Repetitive DNA and repeat-induced point mutations
M. grisea exhibits a high degree of genetic variability, and novel
pathogenic variants capable of infecting formerly resistant host
plants arise with alarming frequency during rice cultivation36. Such
gains of virulence are often associated with transposon-mediated
inactivation or deletion of PAMP-encoding genes whose products
trigger the plant adaptive immune system37,38. Thus, an under-
standing of the natural history of repetitive elements in M. grisea not
only provides an insight into their impact on genome evolution but
also sheds light on mechanisms of pathogenic variation. Approxi-
mately 9.7% of the M. grisea genome assembly comprises repetitive
DNA sequences longer than 200 base pairs (bp) and with greater
than 65% similarity. Four previously unknown repeats were dis-
covered, as were alternative forms for three previously described
transposons. The genome sequence also revealed full-length
sequences of two elements for which only incomplete sequences
were previously available.
Most repetitive sequences in the assembly are retrotransposons
comprising eight major families (Table 3). Five are retroelement
families and three are DNA transposons. These repetitive elements
are not uniformly distributed in the genome assembly, but form
discrete clusters (Supplementary Fig. S7 and Supplementary Note
S1)39. Further examination revealed many examples of elements
inserted into copies of themselves or other elements. Examination
of integration events occurring within other transposons
provides evidence for extensive past recombination in the genome

(Supplementary Discussion S1). Given the prevalence of repetitive
elements and their ability to participate in recombination, it is
perhaps surprising that an organism could tolerate such substantial
genomic change. However, in nature, rice pathogenic strains of
M. grisea propagate asexually and, as such, genome organization is
rarely, if ever, subject to the potentially catastrophic effects of
meiotic recombination involving homologous chromosomes with
radically different structures40. Thus, rearrangements that would
normally have been purged by meiosis appear to have been main-
tained in the absence of deleterious effects on vegetative ﬁtness.
Some rearrangements are expected to have positive ﬁtness beneﬁts,
especially those that result in loss of genes whose products would
normally trigger defence responses in potential hosts. Many host-
speciﬁcity genes in M. grisea are situated in transposon-rich regions
of the genome; this arrangement provides ample opportunity for
host-range expansion through gene loss37,41.
The prevalence of intact and essentially identical repeated DNA
elements in the genome suggests that M. grisea has been unable to
stop their proliferation. This is of interest, because RIP has pre-
viously been reported to occur in at least one strain (Br48) of
M. grisea42. Inspection of M. grisea repeats reveals evidence for RIP
(Supplementary Methods S3). However, for Pyret, the repeat family
showing the most extensive RIP-like mutations, only three-quarters
exhibit signs of RIP and show an average of only 11.4% sequence
divergence from the reference sequence. Other elements such as
Pot2 are present in over 100 apparently intact copies, displaying an
average of 99.4% nucleotide identity. In contrast, all repeat elements
in N. crassa show heavy RIP mutation, typically to greater than 20%
divergence12. The presence of many intact, highly similar elements
despite evidence of RIP can be explained by a number of factors.
First, it is possible that RIP was lost in the sequenced strain.
However, within the genome sequence there are numerous repeti-
tive elements that show only transition mutations. This, combined
with the presence of a gene in M. grisea predicted to encode a DNA
methyltransferase homologous to the RID gene of N. crassa, which is
required for RIP, indicates recent and possibly ongoing RIP43.
Second, the experimental evidence for RIP in M. grisea also
demonstrated that the process is both less efﬁcient at recognizing
repeats and less severe in the number of mutations induced than in
N. crassa42. Therefore, it is possible that many transposable elements
in M. grisea simply escape damage by RIP. Finally, because RIP is
only known to operate during the sexual cycle, the lack of RIP-like
mutations in most repetitive elements may reﬂect the predomi-
nance of vegetative propagation during the recent evolution of rice
pathogenic strains of M. grisea.
Discussion
This is the ﬁrst analysis of the genome of a plant pathogenic fungus.
Our analysis of the M. grisea genome has allowed a much greater
appreciation of the likely attributes required by a plant pathogenic
fungus to invade and colonize a living host plant. M. grisea has a
considerably diverse set of proteins involved in extracellular percep-
tion and signal transduction, an extensive array of secreted proteins
and secondary metabolites, speciﬁcally adapted regulatory path-
ways controlling infection-related development, and a genome
capable of generating considerable genetic variation even in the
absence of sexual reproduction. New opportunities for disease
control and novel targets—such as unique families of CFEM-
GPCR surface receptors and secreted cysteine-rich proteins—for
development of durable fungicides are already apparent from our
analyses. Acquisition of the genome sequence of M. grisea and that
of its host, rice44,45, coupled with the genetic and experimental
tractability of this pathosystem, will enable a systems biology
approach to the study of a plant–fungal interaction. Large-scale,
insertional mutagenesis projects, transcriptional proﬁling and pro-
teomic analysis are already in progress and offer the possibility of an
enhanced understanding of the processes by which a fungus causes
plant disease.
The genome sequence of M. grisea illustrates an extraordinary
feature of the fungal kingdom, namely the extent of sequence
diversity between what are thought of as closely related species
from a taxonomic perspective. For example, although M. grisea and
N. crassa are both pyrenomycetes and are often studied using similar
methods in the same laboratory, they exhibit a degree of sequence
diversity similar to that found between human and Xenopus46.
A
Methods
Strain and growth conditions
Rice-infecting M. grisea strain 70-15 (ref. 47) (Fungal Genetics Stock Center 8958) was
grown in liquid complete medium, and DNA was extracted as previously described48.
Sequencing and assembly
Plasmid (4-kb inserts) and fosmid (40-kb inserts) libraries were generated and end-
sequenced as described (http://www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/fungi/magnaporthe/
assembly.html#clones). Bacterial artiﬁcial chromosome (BAC) libraries were generated
and end-sequenced as described49. The draft genome sequence was assembled using
Arachne (http://www.broad.mit.edu/wga/). Mapped genetic markers were associated with
sequence scaffolds through hybridization to end-sequenced BACs (Supplementary
Methods S1). ESTs were aligned to the genome using a BLAST e-value cutoff of #10220.
Assembly version 2 was used for all subsequent analyses.
Annotation and analysis
Automated gene predictions and annotations were performed using Calhoun (http://
www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/fungi/magnaporthe/gene_ﬁnding.html). Gene
predictions were performed using FGENESH/FGENESH1þ trained on M. grisea
sequences (SoftBerry) and GENEWISE (Sanger Center) and validated against 65
characterized M. grisea genes. Additional information and gene identiﬁcation numbers for
genes featured in this article are presented in Supplementary Table S8.
To perform co-linearity analyses, amino acid identity between M. grisea and N. crassa
was ﬁrst determined by comparing the predicted proteins from each fungus using
BLASTP. Homologues with the best hit were aligned using ClustalW and the amino acid
per cent identity for each pair was calculated. M. grisea and N. crassa genes were considered

to belong to a conserved cluster if there was less then 10 kb between any two genes in the
cluster. Homologous genes in clusters between species were accepted if alignments
spanned $60% of both genes and the alignment score was within 80% of the top score for
either of the pair of genes. In this analysis, a gene may be placed in more than one cluster.
No attempt was made to identify or resolve these cases.
Blastclust (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/LATEST/) was used to cluster
predicted peptide sequences from M. grisea, N. crassa and A. nidulans into families using
threshold limits of 30% identity and 80% length overlap. Functional annotations were
manually curated by examining blast searches to the GenBank NR protein database,
SwissProt and a database of M. grisea repetitive sequences. A heterogeneity G-test was
performed to identify families with signiﬁcant content differences between species. Pair-
wise post-hoc tests were performed using the Bonferroni correction for multiple
comparisons. Families with signiﬁcant similarity to proteins encoded by transposable
elements were removed.
To identify G-protein-coupled receptor-like proteins, known GPCR sequences,
including ones present in GPCRDB (www.gpcr.org/7tm/), were blasted (e-value limit of
#1029) against the M. grisea predicted proteins. These, in addition to candidates
identiﬁed from an Interpro scan, were conﬁrmed to have seven transmembrane spans by
TMPRED (http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/TMPRED_form.html), Phobius (http://
phobius.cgb.ki.se/) and TMHMM (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/). Default
settings were used. N. crassa and A. nidulans CFEM-containing GPCRs were identiﬁed by
BLASTP.
Putative polyketide synthases and non-ribosomal peptide synthases were identiﬁed by
comparison of the genome sequence to known sequences in GenBank from A. nidulans,
Leptosphaeria maculans, Nectria haematococca, Gibberella moniliformis and Cochliobolus
heterostrophus.
Microarray experiments were performed using conidia germinated in water on either
the hydrophobic or hydrophilic side of GelBond. At 7 and 12 h after germination, samples
were ﬂash frozen with liquid nitrogen, scraped from the support, ground and RNA
extracted using Sigma Trizol reagent. RNA was similarly extracted from ungerminated
conidia. RNA from two biological replications of each treatment was pooled in equal
amounts and labelled with Cy3 and Cy5 dyes using Agilent Technologies low input linear
ampliﬁcation kit. Samples were hybridized to the Agilent M. grisea whole genome oligo
array (product G4137A) using manufacturer protocols and reagents. Hybridizations were
performed in an interlaced loop where each treatment was paired with every other. A total
of ten hybridizations were performed, each treatment was used in four hybridizations (two
with Cy3 and two with Cy5). Spot ﬂuorescence was normalized using Lowess within and
between slides, and gene expression proﬁles were analysed in GeneSpring. Microarray data
may be accessed through NCBI GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/)
accession GSE1945.
