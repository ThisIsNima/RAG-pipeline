for Eukaryotic Genomes

The identification of orthologous groups is useful for genome annotation, studies on gene/protein evolution,
comparative genomics, and the identification of taxonomically restricted sequences. Methods successfully exploited
for prokaryotic genome analysis have proved difficult to apply to eukaryotes, however, as larger genomes may
contain multiple paralogous genes, and sequence information is often incomplete. OrthoMCL provides a scalable
method for constructing orthologous groups across multiple eukaryotic taxa, using a Markov Cluster algorithm to
group (putative) orthologs and paralogs. This method performs similarly to the INPARANOID algorithm when
applied to two genomes, but can be extended to cluster orthologs from multiple species. OrthoMCL clusters are
coherent with groups identified by EGO, but improved recognition of “recent” paralogs permits overlapping EGO
groups representing the same gene to be merged. Comparison with previously assigned EC annotations suggests a
high degree of reliability, implying utility for automated eukaryotic genome annotation. OrthoMCL has been
applied to the proteome data set from seven publicly available genomes (human, fly, worm, yeast, Arabidopsis, the
malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, and Escherichia coli). A Web interface allows queries based on individual genes or
user-defined phylogenetic patterns (http://www.cbil.upenn.edu/gene-family). Analysis of clusters incorporating P.
falciparum genes identifies numerous enzymes that were incompletely annotated in first-pass annotation of the parasite
genome.
With the progress of large-scale sequencing efforts, comparative
genomic approaches have increasingly been employed to facili-
tate both evolutionary and functional analyses: Conserved se-
quences can be used to infer evolutionary history, and to the
extent that homology implies conserved biochemical function,
this information may be used to facilitate genome annotation.
The concepts of orthology and paralogy originated from the field
of molecular systematics (Fitch 1970), and have recently been
applied to functional characterizations and classifications on the
scale of whole-genome comparisons (Tatusov et al. 1997, 2000,
2001; Chervitz et al. 1998; Mushegian et al. 1998; Wheelan et al.
1999; Rubin et al. 2000). Orthologs and paralogs constitute two
major types of homologs: The first evolved from a common an-
cestor by speciation, and the latter are related by duplication
events (Fitch 1970, 2000). Although we can assume that paralogs
arising from ancient duplication events are likely to have di-
verged in function (as in the case of - and -tubulins), true
orthologs (e.g., -tubulin from yeast and flies) are likely to retain
identical function over evolutionary time, making ortholog iden-
tification a valuable tool for gene annotation. In comparative
genomics, the clustering of orthologous genes provides a frame-
work for integrating information from multiple genomes, high-
lighting the divergence and conservation of gene families and
biological processes. For pathogens such as the human malaria
parasite of Plasmodium falciparum (Gardner et al. 2002; Kissinger
et al. 2002; Bahl et al. 2003), orthologous groupings can facilitate
the identification of candidates for drug and/or vaccine develop-
ment.
The identification of orthologous groups in prokaryotic ge-
nomes has permitted cross-referencing of genes from multiple
species, facilitating genome annotation, protein family classifi-
cation, studies on bacterial evolution, and the identification of
candidates for antibacterial drug development (Tatusov et al.
1997; Galperin and Koonin 1999; Natale et al. 2000a,b; Forterre
2002). The Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) database
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/) is constructed based on
all-against-all BLAST searches of complete proteomes (Tatusov et
al. 2000, 2001). Sequences from distinct genomes that are recip-
rocal best hits (i.e., the first sequence finds the second sequence
as its best hit in the second species, and vice versa) are identified
as a pair of orthologs, and “COGs” recognizing relationships
among at least three distinct lineages (triangles) have been iden-
tified across distant phylogenetic lineages.
Although Saccharomyces cerevisiae is included in the COG
database, general application of this approach in the construc-
tion of orthologous groups for other eukaryotic genomes has
proved problematic (even for complete prokaryotic genomes, ex-
tensive manual inspection of COGs is often required to correct
false-positives and split mega-clusters). Complications associated
with ortholog group construction for eukaryotic genomes in-
clude extensive gene duplication and functional redundancy, the
multidomain structure of many proteins, and the predominance
of incomplete eukaryotic genome sequencing (Doolittle 1995;
Henikoff et al. 1997). These challenges demand an approach able
to distinguish between “recent” paralogs (i.e., gene duplications
occurring subsequent to speciation, such as the multiple -tubu-
lins found in the human genome), and “ancient” paralogs likely
to exhibit different function(s). Recent paralogs (which are
equally related to orthologs in other species) are likely to retain
similar function, and should be grouped with true orthologs, It is
also important to assess global relationships among orthologs,
without being misled by local relationships coming from com-
plicated domain structures or incorrect ortholog assignments.
Unfortunately, the computational costs of multiple sequence
alignments and phylogenetic tree construction, and the diffi-
culty in interpreting such alignments and trees, preclude a phy-
logenetic approach for whole-genome comparisons in eukary-
otes.

The INPARANOID algorithm (Remm et al. 2001) exploits a
BLAST-based strategy to identify orthologs as reciprocal best hits
between two species, while applying additional rules to accom-
modate paralogs arising from duplication after speciation (a.k.a.
in-paralogs). Note that the resulting ortholog groups include
paralogs derived by recent gene duplication, as each of these
proteins is orthologous to a protein in another species. This al-
gorithm performs well in the identification of ortholog groups
compared to a curated set of yeast versus mammalian orthologs
defined by phylogenetic methods, providing evidence that the
strategy based on reciprocal best hits works well in separating
orthologs from “ancient” paralogs. Unfortunately, the rule-based
approach used by INPARANOID assumes that pairwise compari-
son is limited to comparisons between two species. EGO (previ-
ously named TOGA; Lee et al. 2002) applies a COG-based ap-
proach to the TIGR gene indices (Quackenbush et al. 2000, 2001),
and this method is applicable to multiple species. In the absence
of a rigorously curated data set of orthologs from multiple eu-
karyotic species, it is difficult to assess performance, but EGO is
easily misled by the functional redundancy of multiple paralogs,
and by the absence of true orthologs within incomplete genome
data sets.
Motivated by these challenges, we developed OrthoMCL as
an alternative approach for automated eukaryotic ortholog group
identification. To distinguish functional redundancy from diver-
gence, this method identifies “recent” paralogs to be included in
ortholog groups as within-species BLAST hits that are reciprocally
better than between-species hits. This approach is similar to
INPARANOID, but differs primarily in the requirement that re-
cent paralogs must be more similar to each other than to any
sequence from other species. To resolve the many-to-many or-
thologous relationships inherent in comparisons across multiple
genomes, OrthoMCL applies the Markov Cluster algorithm
(MCL; Van Dongen 2000; http://micans.org/mcl/), which is
based on probability and graph flow theory and allows simulta-
neous classification of global relationships in a similarity space.
MCL simulates random walks on a graph using Markov matrices
to determine the transition probabilities among nodes of the
graph. The MCL algorithm has previously been exploited for
clustering a large set of protein sequences, where it was found to
be very fast and reliable in dealing with complicated domain
structures (Enright et al. 2002). OrthoMCL generates clusters of
proteins where each cluster consists of orthologs or “recent”
paralogs from at least two species. We have now employed Or-
thoMCL to examine the proteomes from several other genomes,
including Homo sapiens (human), Drosophila melanogaster (fruit
fly), Caenhorhabditis elegans (nematode worm), Saccharomyces cer-
evisiae (yeast), the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the pro-
tozoan malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, and the bacte-
rium Escherichia coli; results can be examined online (http://
www.cbil.upenn.edu/gene-family). The underlying object-based
relational storage model GUS (Genomic Unified Schema; David-
son et al. 2001) also hosts the human–mouse DoTS gene index
(http://www.allgenes.org) and the Plasmodium Genome Database
PlasmoDB (http://PlasmoDB.org; Kissinger et al. 2002; Bahl et al.
2003), permitting these results to be integrated with various or-
ganismal data types to facilitate comprehensive data mining.
RESULTS
Identification of Orthologous Groups by OrthoMCL
The OrthoMCL procedure starts with all-against-all BLASTP com-
parisons of a set of protein sequences from genomes of interest
(Fig. 1). Putative orthologous relationships are identified between
pairs of genomes by reciprocal best similarity pairs. For each pu-
tative ortholog, probable “recent” paralogs are identified as se-
quences within the same genome that are (reciprocally) more
similar to each other than either is to any sequence from another
genome. A P-value cut-off of 1e-5 was chosen for putative or-
thologs or paralogs, based on empirical studies.
Next, putative orthologous and paralogous relationships are
converted into a graph in which the nodes represent protein
sequences, and the weighted edges represent their relationships.
As shown in Figure 2, weights are initially computed as the av-
erage log10 (P-value) of BLAST results for each pair of se-
quences. Because the high similarity of “recent” paralogs relative
to orthologs can bias the clustering process, edge weights are
then normalized to reflect the average weight for all ortholog
pairs in these two species (or “recent” paralogs when comparing
within species). Although more sophisticated weighting schemes
can be envisioned, this simple method for adjusting the system-
atic bias between edges connecting sequences within the same
genome and edges connecting sequences from different genomes
seems to generate satisfactory results, judging from the compari-
son with INPARANOID, the EGO database, and EC annotations
(see below). The resulting graph is represented by a symmetric
similarity matrix to which the MCL algorithm (Enright et al.
2002) is applied. MCL uses flow simulation and considers all the
relationships in the graph globally and simultaneously during
clustering, providing a robust method for separating diverged
paralogs, distant orthologs mistakenly assigned based on (weak)
reciprocal best hits, and sequences with different domain struc-
tures. An important parameter in the MCL algorithm is the in-
flation value, regulating the cluster tightness (granularity); in-
creasing the inflation value increases cluster tightness (see be-
low). Clusters containing sequences from at least two species

form the final output of this procedure: clustered groups of or-
thologs and “recent” paralogs.
OrthoMCL Performance on a Pairwise Comparison
of Worm and Fly Proteomes
In order to evaluate the performance of OrthoMCL on pair-
wise comparisons between two species, both OrthoMCL and
INPARANOID were applied to the complete set of protein pre-
dictions for the fly and worm. Because OrthoMCL uses
WU-BLAST results for sequence similarities and INPARANOID
uses NCBI-BLAST, INPARANOID was adapted to use the log10
(P-value) from WU-BLAST as a similarity measure, rather than the
NCBI-BLAST bit score (see Methods). INPARANOID identified
slightly more orthologous sequences than previously reported
(Remm et al. 2001), due to a lower stringency in filtering BLAST
results (see Methods). The computational time required for the
application of either method is primarily at-
tributable to BLAST analysis and postpro-
cessing of these results. Given processed
BLAST results, OrthoMCL required ∼35 min
on a Linux i686 computer to cluster
the worm and fly protein data sets (in-
cluding database transactions), whereas
INPARANOID required 15 min (note that
OrthoMCL is implemented as a pipeline on
a relational database whereas INPARANOID
operates on flat files). Clusters obtained us-
ing the two methods were compared by de-
termining the number of groups that are
identical, and those that are coherent—that
is, where the sequences in a group gener-
ated by one method are a subset of se-
quences in a group generated by the other
(note that identical groups are a subset of
coherent groups).
As shown in Table 1, from a total of
33,062 proteins (13,288 fly; 19,774 worm),
OrthoMCL clustered 10,849 sequences
(33% of the total data set) into 4061 groups,
whereas INPARANOID clustered 11,357
sequences (34%) into 4135 groups. We
found that 10,597 sequences (32% of the
total data set) were recognized by both
OrthoMCL and INPARANOID. Thus, 98%
of the proteins grouped by OrthoMCL
were also grouped by INPARANOID,
whereas 93% of the proteins grouped by
INPARANOID were also grouped by
OrthoMCL. In addition, 8629 proteins
(81% of the total number grouped by both algorithms) were
grouped into 3735 identical groups, representing 92% of the total
number of orthologous groups identified by OrthoMCL, and
90% of the INPARANOID groups. It was revealed that 10,229
proteins (97%) formed coherent groups; 3888 OrthoMCL groups
(96%) were a subset of an INPARANOID group, and 3912
INPARANOID groups (95%) were a subset of an OrthoMCL
group. These results demonstrate that when employed for the
comparison of two genomes, OrthoMCL and INPARANOID ex-
hibit very similar performances.
OrthoMCL Performance on a Three-Species Data Set
(Yeast, Worm, Fly)
A serious limitation to the general application of INPARANOID
for comparative genomics applications is that this algorithm can
only be employed to compare two sets of proteins, as noted
above. In contrast, OrthoMCL can be applied to all-against-all
Figure 2
Illustration of sequence relationships and similarity matrix construction. Dotted arrows
represent “recent” paralogy (duplication subsequent to speciation); solid arrows represent orthol-
ogy. The upper right half of the matrix contains initial weights calculated as average log10
(P-value) from pairwise WU-BLASTP similarities. The lower left half contains corrected weights
supplied to the MCL algorithm; the edge weight connecting each pair of sequences wij is divided
by Wij/W, where W represents the average weight among all ortholog (underlined) and “recent”
paralog (italicized) pairs, and Wij represents the average edge weight among all ortholog pairs from
species i and j. The net result of this normalization is to correct for systematic differences in
comparisons between two species (e.g., differences attributable to nucleotide composition bias),
and when i = j, to minimize the impact of “recent” paralogs (duplication within a given species) on
the clustering of cross-species orthologs.

comparisons of multiple genomes. As a test case, we applied Or-
thoMCL to the complete proteomes of yeast, fly, and worm; re-
sults are summarized in Table 2. From the data set of 39,420
proteins (6358 from yeast, 13,288 fly, and 19,774 worm), Or-
thoMCL placed 13,851 proteins (2531 yeast, 5409 fly, 5911
worm) into 4425 groups (using I = 2.5). The bottom row of Table
2 shows that 1748 (40%) of these groups contain sequences from
all three species.
EGO is based on a clustering of transcribed sequences, and
provides the most comprehensive published resource of eukary-
otic ortholog groups (Lee et al. 2002). These groups are defined
by first clustering and assembling ESTs and transcripts into con-
sensus sequences that are represented in the TIGR Gene Indices
(Quackenbush et al. 2000, 2001). Gene indices are then used to
construct ortholog groups by pairwise comparisons, using an ap-
proach similar to that employed in the COG database (Tatusov et
al. 2000, 2001); in EGO, reciprocal best match pairs that link at
least three species are clustered into groups. Finally, paralogs are
identified as one-way best hits, and groups are further combined
by merging extensively overlapping groups.
To compare the OrthoMCL results for yeast, fly, and worm
with the EGO database (including genes from many species), we
first compared the gene indices for these species to their pro-
teomes using BLASTP. We then extracted those EGO groups that
contain sequences from at least two of the three species, and
discarded sequences derived from other species. This yields a
nonredundant set of 5286 proteins (923 from yeast, 2138 fly,
2225 worm), corresponding to 6106 gene index sequences (note
that because the EST database used to construct gene indices
contains partial cDNA sequences and alternatively spliced iso-
forms, multiple gene index sequences sometimes map to a single
protein). A total of 3620 EGO groups were identified, of which
814 (22%) contain sequences from all three species. In the analy-
sis below, groups derived from the EGO da-
tabase are referred to as the “EGO subset”.
Far more sequences were grouped by
OrthoMCL (13,851) than the EGO subset
(5286); this accounts for 35% versus 13% of
all protein sequences. In some cases, the
greater inclusiveness of OrthoMCL is attrib-
utable to the recognition of “recent” para-
logs that were missed by EGO because they
were not best hits. In other cases this re-
flects the inclusion of ortholog groups con-
taining only two species in OrthoMCL
(EGO, like COG, requires a ‘triangle’ of re-
ciprocal best hits joining sequences in three
species). Figure 3 provides an illustrative ex-
ample, showing OrthoMCL group #379767,
containing five synaptobrevin genes from
worm, yeast, and fly (including “recent
paralogs” in the latter two species). Only
Syb (fly), n-syb (fly), and snb-1 (worm)—
mapping to gene indices TC134828,
TC140251 from Drosophila, and TC72314
from C. elegans, respectively—were identi-
fied by the EGO subset (Syb and snb-1 were

t w o
E G O
g r o u p s —
TOG273790 and TOG272289—whereas n-
syb and Snb-1 were contained in
TOG257010). The EGO subset failed to in-
clude any synaptobrevin genes from yeast,
because they did not form a triangle of re-
ciprocal best matches due to independent
recent gene duplications in yeast and fly,
producing “recent” paralogs. Syb, n-syb, and
snb-1 were included in the EGO subset only because they formed
triangles of reciprocal best hits with sequences from other species
not analyzed here (based on BLASTN searches; note that the
BLASTP analysis employed by OrthoMCL identifies n-syb as the
best hit when querying with snb-1 against the fly proteome).
Virtually all of the 5286 proteins grouped in the EGO subset
were also grouped by OrthoMCL, (4959 = 94%; Table 2). Of the
327 sequences not represented in OrthoMCL, many represent
cases where EGO groupings were dependent on sequences from
other species in the complete EGO database, which would pre-
sumably be recognized by a larger-scale application of Or-
thoMCL. Other differences are attributable to the addition of
sequences by EGO on the basis of one-way best hits, inappropri-
ately grouping functionally diverged (i.e., “ancient”) paralogs
where true orthologs have been lost. In still other cases, recipro-
cal best hits were separated by OrthoMCL during the clustering
step because they exhibit much lower similarity than other se-
quences in the group. Finally, some differences are attributable to
the use of BLASTN in constructing the EGO database, whereas
OrthoMCL uses BLASTP.
Of the 4959 sequences grouped by both methods, 2432
(49%) were included in 989 identical groups. To assess the co-
herence of nonidentical groups, we examined cases where groups
identified by one method were extended by the alternative
method, that is, cases where all sequences contained in an Or-
thoMCL group are included in a larger EGO group, or vice-versa.
Only 70 OrthoMCL groups were extended by EGO, but Or-
thoMCL extends 2038 EGO groups. Combining all of these cat-
egories ([EGO = OrthoMCL] + [EGO ⊃
OrthoMCL] + [OrthoMCL
⊃
EGO]) yields a total of 4716 sequences. Thus 95% of the total
number of sequences identified by both algorithms were repre-
sented in coherent groups (this number is smaller than the sum
of sequences in all three subsets, because many sequences appear

index sequences (TC72314, TC140251, TC134828) formed ‘triangles’ of reciprocal best matches
based on BLASTN comparisons with other species not shown in this analysis.

in multiple EGO groups, despite a final step in which initial EGO
groups are merged).
As shown in Table 3, OrthoMCL successfully clusters mul-
tiple overlapping groups identified by EGO. Because the algo-
rithm only clusters reciprocal best hits, EGO places eight glycer-
aldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) genes from
yeast, fly, and worm into 14 overlapping groups, the largest of
which contains seven genes (some of these groups are identical,
and some are a subset of others, because the EGO database
grouped these sequences with genes from other species not ana-
lyzed here). In contrast, OrthoMCL clusters a total of nine
GAPDH genes into a single group (#380487; Table 3); the recog-
nition of “recent” paralogs causes multiple sequences to be clus-
tered together by OrthoMCL, reducing the redundant groups pre-
sented by EGO.
We also examined OrthoMCL and EGO groups exhibiting
distinct phylogenetic patterns, as shown in the bottom half of
Table 2. Many groups from both analyses contain sequences
from all three species (bottom line of Table 2: 1748 = 40% of
OrthoMCL groups, 814 = 22% of EGO groups), and comparisons
between OrthoMCL and the EGO subset reveal a high degree of
coherence: 79% of EGO groups were subgroups of OrthoMCL
groups. The majority of groups identified by both analyses con-
tain sequences from fly and worm, but not yeast (2307 = 52% of
OrthoMCL groups, 1874 = 52% of EGO groups), reflecting the
many shared derived characters associated with metazoa. Forty-
two percent of EGO groups containing fly+worm but not yeast
sequences were subgroups of OrthoMCL groups exhibiting the
same species distribution. For such phylogenetically restricted
groups, the coherence between OrthoMCL and EGO is somewhat
lower than for unrestricted groups, because OrthoMCL extends
many EGO groups to include sequences from the excluded spe-
cies. The grouping of individual sequences recognized by both
algorithms is highly coherent, however (>90%). Far fewer groups
were identified with other phylogenetic distribution patterns
(215 OrthoMCL groups contain yeast and fly but not worm se-
quences; 155 OrthoMCL groups contain yeast and worm but not
fly sequences), and the coherence between OrthoMCL and EGO
was lower for these groups.
In sum, the OrthoMCL and EGO algorithms exhibit highly
consistent ortholog groupings. By distinguishing “recent” para-
logs from “ancient” paralogs, and clustering “recent” paralogs
together with orthologs, OrthoMCL improves the accuracy of the
ortholog group assignments, increases data coverage, and de-
creases the redundancy of data representation.
Application of OrthoMCL to P. falciparum, Human,
and Other Eukaryotic Genomes
Based on the success of these analyses, we applied OrthoMCL to
a data set of seven proteomes, totaling 101,047 proteins, includ-
ing A. thaliana (25,009 proteins), C. elegans (19,774), D. melano-
gaster (13,288), Homo sapiens (27,049), P. falciparum (5279), S.
cerevisiae (6358), and E. coli (4290). As shown in Table 4, appli-
cation of OrthoMCL at an inflation index of 2.5 to the complete
proteomes for these seven species identified 7681 groups, repre-
senting a total of 45,473 protein sequences (see below for further
discussion of the inflation index). In comparison to the 4425
groups identified in the three species data set from Table 2, 74%
more groups were identified, representing an increase of 228% in
the number of sequences for which putative orthologs could be
identified. Thus, most new sequences added to the data set could
be accommodated within previously defined groups (the average
number sequences/group rose from 3.1 for the three-taxon data
set to 5.9 for the seven-taxon data set).
One important application of orthologous group identifica-
tion lies in the functional characterization of proteins. In order to
assess the utility of OrthoMCL results for protein functional
analysis, we examined the consistency of these groups with
respect to enzyme commission (EC) numbers assigned by the
ENZYME database (http://us.expasy.org/enzyme), reasoning that
EC numbers are probably among the most reliable functional
assignments that have been widely applied during genome an-
notation. The complete data set includes a total of 3562 se-
quences for which a complete EC number has been assigned
(described as ‘EC-annotated’ in the analysis below). At an infla-
tion index of 2.5, 2840 of these (80%) were included in Or-
thoMCL groups. As expected, changing the inflation index af-
fects cluster tightness: Lower ‘I’ values result in the inclusion of
more sequences in fewer groups (50,771 sequences in 6,249

groups at I = 1.1), whereas increasing the inflation index frag-
ments clusters and reduces the number of sequences included
(43,900 sequences in 7896 groups at I = 4). Recognition of se-
quences associated with EC numbers parallels this trend: Increas-
ing the inflation value from 1.1 to 4 reduced the number of
EC-annotated sequences that were clustered from 2921 to 2811,
and increased the number of associated groups from 999 to 1186.
It is worth noting that sequences annotated with EC numbers
were relatively insensitive to cluster tightness (this range of ‘I’
values affects the inclusion of 7% of total sequences in Or-
thoMCL groups, but only 3% of EC-annotated sequences), pre-
sumably due to the fact that conserved sequences are more likely
well annotated.
Only ∼6% of all sequences in the combined proteome are
associated with EC annotations (2840/45,473 at I = 2.5), but their
distribution is decidedly nonrandom: Only 1160/7681 groups
contain any EC-annotated sequences at all, but 705 of these 1160
groups contain more than one EC-annotated sequence. Groups
containing two or more EC-annotated sequences can be used to
assess the consistency with which OrthoMCL groups these en-
zymes, by examining the percentage of groups within which all
EC annotations are identical. Of the 705 OrthoMCL groups con-
taining at least two EC-annotated sequences (at I = 2.5), all EC
annotations were identical within 617 (88%) of these groups,
representing 2062 EC-annotated sequences (4556 total se-
quences). Of the few cases where enzymes from the same ortho-
log group were associated with different EC numbers, most show
inconsistency only at the fourth level of EC hierarchy, suggesting
inconsistency in annotation rather than incorrect orthologous
group assignment (data not shown). In some cases such incon-
sistency may also be attributable to cases where multiple EC
numbers are assigned to a single (multifunctional) enzyme.
The percentage of groups that are consistent with EC assign-
ments increases from 80% to 88% with increasing cluster tight-
ness. These differences are most pronounced when the inflation
value increases from 1.1 to 1.5; the number of EC-annotated
sequences in consistent groups was maximal at I = 2.0 (2073 se-
quences). Tight clustering tends to prevent sequences with dif-
ferent functions from being clustered together, but may also
separate true orthologs (e.g., EF-G genes were broken into two
clusters when the inflation index was increased from 1.5 to 2.0).
An inflation index of I = 1.5 (where 86% of all groups are EC-
consistent) appears to balance sensitivity and selectivity: exhib-
iting consistency close to the maximum observed value, while
excluding a minimum number of sequences.
Clustering the entire data set at I = 1.5 yields 7265 groups
from a total of 47,668 sequences. We found that 195 groups
contained sequences from all seven species analyzed, represent-
ing genes that are shared between eukaryotes and bacteria, in-
cluding DNA helicase, DNA mismatch repair proteins, ribosomal
proteins, thymidylate synthase, tRNA synthetases, enolase, ACP
synthase, pyruvate kinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydro-
genase, etc. (see Supplemental Table 1; http://www.cbil.upenn.
edu/gene-family/SupTable1.htm). In addition, 856 groups con-
tain sequences from all six eukaryotic species but not E. coli,
representing genes that are conserved among (and may also be
restricted to) eukaryotic lineages. The largest groups in this cat-
egory include calcium-dependent protein kinase, histone pro-
teins (H2B, H3, H4), MAP kinase, cyclophilin-type peptidylprolyl
isomerase, myosin, hexokinase, high-mobility group proteins,
etc. The distribution of orthologous groups having distinct phy-
logenetic patterns of gene presence/absence of specific species
has been compiled as Supplemental Table 2 (http://www.cbil.
upenn.edu/gene-family/SupTable2.htm).
OrthoMCL groups have been stored in the GUS relational
database (Davidson et al. 2001) and may be queried through
keyword searches based on sequence name or description, or by
user-defined patterns of species distribution (http://www.cbil.
upenn.edu/gene-family), as indicated in Figure 4. The report for
each selected ortholog group provides an interactive graphical
display of the similarity relationships among related sequences, a
table of information related to each individual member of the
group (including, e.g., functional assignments based on Gene
Ontologies; Ashburner et al. 2000; The Gene Ontology Consor-
tium 2001; Schug et al. 2002), and a multiple sequence alignment
of the group members generated using CLUSTALW (Thompson
et al. 1994). The graphical representation can be customized to
selectively show two-way best matches, one-way best matches,
and “recent” paralog relationships among group members or all
of the related sequences (see Fig. 4).
Mining the P. falciparum Proteome: Insights
From Ortholog Groupings
The clusters of orthologous genes produced by OrthoMCL can be
used to address a variety of biological questions from the per-
spective of comparative genomics, focusing on shared and diver-
gent biochemical functions. A complete genome sequence for
the protozoan parasite Plasmodium falciparum (responsible for the
most severe form of human malaria) was recently published
(Gardner et al. 2002), and we were interested in exploring
whether orthologous group analysis might be useful for func-
tional assignment of predicted proteins by inferring function
from other genomes. Where the orthologs have known function
in other species, it might be possible to assign putative function
in P. falciparum. Cases in which orthologs can be defined for
which no function has been assigned may be interesting for evo-
lutionary and functional study. Plasmodium proteins for which
no orthologs are identifiable may represent targets for parasite-
specific chemotherapy and/or vaccine development. Consider-
ing the complete P. falciparum proteome of 5279 sequences, 2191
OrthoMCL groups incorporate a total of 3069 parasite sequences.
Complete EC annotations are available for 349 Plasmodium
proteins, and 315 (90%) of these are included in 302 OrthoMCL
groups. Of these 302 groups, 270 (89%) also include a total of 931
other EC-annotated proteins, of which 833 (89%) are identical to
the P. falciparum EC annotations. We found that 175 P. falcipa-
rum sequences without a complete EC number are included in
143 groups containing at least one EC-annotated sequence from
another species; 84 of these groups contain at least two EC-
annotated sequences. Some of these cases represent properly an-
notated P. falciparum genes for which EC assignments are missing
or incomplete from the annotation, whereas others are anno-
tated as hypothetical proteins. Based on the high level of consis-
tency between OrthoMCL groups and EC assignments (Table 4),
the complete EC numbers associated with these groups provide a
presumptive functional assignment for these P. falciparum or-
thologs. Manual curation has confirmed at least 137 of these
assignments as valid annotations that were missed during first-
pass annotation.
Extending this analysis beyond EC annotations, a total of
1297 P. falciparum sequences annotated as “hypothetical pro-
teins” are included in OrthoMCL groups. Where available, an-
notations associated with the entire group may prove relevant
to the orthologous P. falciparum sequences, providing more reli-
able transitive annotations than the results from a simple BLAST
similarity search. For example, P. falciparum PFD0450c, anno-
tated as “hypothetical protein, conserved”, was clustered in
ortholog group #405550 with six other sequences (human
ENSP00000263436, fly FBgn0036487, Arabidopsis AT1g60170
and AT3g60610, worm CE24126, and yeast YGR091W). “Un-

were described as similar to a splicing factor, whereas the other
four members were all annotated as having pre-mRNA splicing
function. Multiple sequence alignment of these sequences pro-
vides further support to this putative functional assignment.
One primary goal of pathogen genome projects is to accel-
erate the search for new drug and vaccine targets. Phylogeneti-
cally restricted genes in the parasites that have diverged from (or
are absent in) animals are likely to be associated with biological
processes that distinguish them from their animal hosts. Search-
ing based on species distribution identifies 447 groups contain-
ing sequences from P. falciparum but no human orthologs, and
273 groups containing sequences from P. falciparum but not hu-
man, fly, or worm. Proteins with this restricted species distribu-
tion include known drug targets such as dihydropteroate synthe-
tase (Group 407390), an ancient gene (shared with E. coli) that
has been lost in the animal lineage. Putative orthologs of the
chloroquine resistance transporter (Group 403748) are identified
only in A. thaliana, although a weaker (but reciprocal) best hit is
identified in C. elegans as a chemoreceptor. Many groups con-
taining P. falciparum sequences but not animal sequences include
sequences from A. thaliana. Some of these may derive from the
secondary endosymbiosis of a eukaryotic alga (Kohler et al. 1997;
Roos 1999), giving rise to the apicoplast—a plastid remnant that
is essential for parasite survival (Fichera and Roos 1997; He et al.
2001). Known apicoplast proteins include enoyl-acyl carrier re-
ductase (FABI; Group 403190) and 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phos-
phate reductoisomerase (DOXPR; Group 402142), both of which
are under study as potential drug targets. Phylogenetically re-
stricted genes that are conserved in related parasite species pro-
vide candidates for broad-spectrum antibiotic development; or-
thologs of all the genes noted above have also been identified in
Plasmodium yoelii yoelli (Carlton et al. 2002).
DISCUSSION
Challenges for Comparative Eukaryotic Genomics
Compared to prokaryotes, eukaryotic genomes tend to exhibit a
much higher rate of duplicative gene family expansion. The dy-
namic fate of these paralogs makes it important—and difficult—
to distinguish functional redundancy from functional diver-
gence. Genes that have evolved from relatively “ancient” dupli-
cation events (i.e., duplication before speciation) may have
diverged to acquire new functions, and these homologs should
not be clustered with true orthologs. In contrast, relatively “re-
cent” duplication events (i.e., duplication after speciation) may
produce multiple copies of similar or identical genes compared to
their orthologs in other species. As noted above, we define these
genes as “recent” paralogs, and have devised methods to cluster
such genes along with orthologs from other genomes in a many-
to-many relationship. Thus OrthoMCL groups six “recent” -tu-
bulin paralogs in humans with the -tubulin genes from other
eukaryotic species (OrthoMCL group 412325), but not with the
“ancient” - and -tubulin paralogs (OrthoMCL groups 412877
and 410694, respectively; see Fig. 4). Incorporating “recent” para-
logs into ortholog groups also avoids problems associated with
inaccurate or incomplete assembly of eukaryotic genomes—a
common problem when microsatellite sequences are abundant.
A second challenge in clustering orthologous groups in eu-
karyotes comes from the complicated domain architecture of
many proteins. In constructing ortholog groups, clustered pro-
teins should have very similar if not identical domain structure.
Otherwise, proteins with markedly different functions may be
mistakenly clustered into a single group because they share simi-
larities with distinct regions of a multidomain protein, or because
they share domains present in many families. For example, the
presence of bifunctional dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate
synthase genes in protists and plants should not lead to the in-
clusion of monofunctional dihydrofolate reductase and thymi-
dylate synthase genes from bacteria, fungi, and animals within a
single group. In the COG approach, ‘triangles’ of mutually con-
sistent, genome-specific best hits are merged if they share a com-
mon side, to form larger orthologous groups. This straightfor-
ward clustering procedure based on transitivity is limited in deal-
ing with complicated domain structures of proteins, as it only
considers the local relationship among sequences belonging to
the triangles to be merged, while ignoring the global relationship
among all proteins to be clustered in the same group. As a result,
the original COG method inappropriately merges unrelated pro-
teins based on similarities to different regions of multidomain
proteins; further refinement of the COG database requires
manual inspection on a case-by-case basis.
A third challenge in identifying eukaryotic ortholog groups
derives from the “incompleteness” of genome sequence data. The
economics of genome sequencing means that extensive ‘shot-
gun’ sequencing is (or soon will be) available for many eukary-
otes, long before the genome has been sequenced to completion.
For example, extensive genome sequence information is now
available for at least 10 species of apicomplexan parasites (and
extensive EST data sets are available for several additional spe-
cies), but only the P. falciparum genome has been completely
sequenced. This means that true orthologs may be missing, and
reciprocal best hits may identify inappropriate substitutes, such
as divergent (ancient) paralogs. OrthoMCL evaluates the global
pattern of sequence similarities among provisionally grouped se-
quences during clustering (Fig. 2), minimizing errors attributable
to missing genes, because diverged paralogs are likely to exhibit
lower similarity to each other when compared with the similari-
ties between true orthologs.
Identification of Eukaryotic Ortholog Groups
by OrthoMCL
This report describes a novel approach for the construction of
orthologous groups from eukaryotic genomes—identifying both
orthologs between species and functionally redundant (“recent”)
paralogs within species, and grouping these together using the
MCL algorithm to cluster graph vertices by flow simulation. The
OrthoMCL approach can be viewed as a two-step process: A
graph representation of sequence relationships is generated, and
then divided into subgraphs using the MCL algorithm. The first
step involves applying rules based on biological knowledge of the
problem to determine which sequences should be included, how
sequence nodes are connected, and how to weight edges in order
to quantify the relationships between sequences. The second step
is a graph clustering problem where computational theories and
techniques come into play.
The MCL graph clustering algorithm includes a parameter
regulating cluster granularity—the inflation index. Table 4 shows
that the inflation parameter has relatively little impact on the
resultant clusters, however: Rather coarse-grained clustering
(I = 1.5) provides sufficient tightness for identifying coherent EC
groups, for example. This is even more obvious when a smaller
number of genomes is analyzed, as observed from comparisons
with INPARANOID and the EGO database using yeast, worm, and
fly proteins (data not shown). Overall, the simple structured
graph itself seems to capture sequence relationships quite well.
OrthoMCL produces results similar to INPARANOID when
applied to two genomes (Table 1), while offering the opportunity
to compare multiple genomes. Orthologous group identification
across multiple genomes can be very useful for genome annota-
tion, revealing the phylogenetic patterns of proteins from dis-
tinct lineages, and providing evolutionary insights into the con-

servation and diversity of cellular functions in different species.
OrthoMCL groupings were coherent with groups produced by
EGO (Table 2), with most differences attributable to extending
the EGO groups through the addition of “recent” paralogs, and
combining EGO groups linked via these paralogs (Fig. 3; Table 3).
OrthoMCL differs from the EGO strategy (and the COG al-
gorithm commonly applied to prokaryotic genomes; Tatusov et
al. 2000, 2001) in several ways. OrthoMCL does not insist on a
minimum of three species to form a “triangle” of reciprocal best
hits, a requirement which poses problems when genome se-
quence information may be incomplete. Moreover, even when
complete genomes are compared, groups representing orthologs
in only two species can be very informative, as from the com-
parison of P. falciparum and A. thaliana cited above. OrthoMCL
also differs from EGO by incorporating “recent” paralogs, and by
considering these sequences together with orthologs during the
clustering process, rather than appending paralogs as one-way
best hits after clustering reciprocal best hits. This strategy is par-
ticularly useful for the analysis of eukaryotic genomes, where
gene duplications may prevent the formation of reciprocal best
hits (cf. Fig. 3).
The implementation of OrthoMCL outlined above provides
a successful proof of concept, although further improvements
may be possible by focusing on individual components of the
process. BLASTP comparisons might be modified to provide a
more sophisticated weighting scheme for capturing sequence
similarities and domain architecture, providing greater robust-
ness in dealing with protein fusions. Modifying the normaliza-
tion of inter- versus intra-species weights might improve the han-
dling of lineage-specific expansions. Finally, alternative cluster-
ing algorithms might be applied (Shi and Malik 1997; Abascal
and Valencia 2002).
Mining Comparative Genome Databases
Identification of orthologous groups across multiple eukaryotic
taxa provides a valuable resource for automated genome anno-
tation, as noted above. BLAST-based clustering assumes equal
evolutionary rates among paralogs, however, masking cases
where “recent” paralogs may have evolved to acquire new func-
tion, or where distant orthologs differ significantly (e.g., in the
substrate specificities of enzymes). The ability to adjust clustering
granularity makes OrthoMCL scalable for the identification of
functionally conserved orthologs and paralogs. The consistency
of EC assignments with OrthoMCL groups justifies the use of this
tool in automated annotation.
Distinctive biological features revealed by the phylogenetic
patterns from orthologous grouping are particularly useful for
analyzing pathogen genomes, offering great potential for biologi-
cal investigation of pathogen evolution and drug or vaccine tar-
gets. In the future, we plan to expand the Web-based database of
orthologous groups illustrated in Table 4 and Figure 4 to include
other species, and to integrate these results into genome data-
bases such as the malaria parasite genome database PlasmoDB
(Kissinger et al. 2002; Bahl et al. 2003), to facilitate data mining
by the research community.

TIGR Gene Indices obtained from http://www.tigr.org/tdb/
tgi/.
EGO database obtained from http://www.tigr.org/tdb/tgi/
ego/index.shtml.
EC associations for SWISS-PROT proteins obtained from the
ENZYME database ftp://us.expasy.org/databases/enzyme.
Software
BLAST searches were carried out using WU-BLAST 2.0 http://
blast.wustl.edu/. INPARANOID software was obtained from
http://kisac.cgb.ki.se/cgb/inparanoid/. MCL software was ob-
tained from http://micans.org/mcl/mcl-02-063/.
Identification of Ortholog Groups Using INPARANOID
The source code of INPARANOID was modified so that it could be
applied to WU-BLAST results using log10(P-value) as the simi-
larity score. Based on the distribution of P-values from BLAST
results, a score of 350 was used when the P-value was returned as
‘0’, and the similarity score between a sequence and itself was
defined as 350. A cutoff P-value of 1e-5 was used, and no match
length coverage is required. The cutoff confidence value for in-
paralogs (“recent” paralogs) was set at 0.01.
Construction of the “EGO Subset”
Orthologous groups containing gene index sequences (TCs) from
yeast, worm, or fly were extracted from the EGO database, and
TCs from other Gene Indices in these groups were discarded.
Each TC from these groups was then substituted with its best
match in the proteome, determined by comparing sequences
from yeast, worm, and fly Gene Indices with their respective
proteomes using BLASTP (V = 1, B = 1, cutoff P-value of 1e-5).
Redundant sequences (arising when more than one TC was as-
sociated with a protein) were removed so that each transformed
group contained a distinct set of protein sequences, and redun-
dant groups were removed when identical. From the resultant
groups, those containing protein sequences from at least two of
the three species were used to construct the “EGO subset”.
Evaluation of Consistency With EC Assignments
SWISS-PROT proteins associated with EC number annotations
were first cross-referenced with sequences from the relevant pro-
teome using BLASTP (>98% identity over >98% of query se-
quence length). EC numbers associated with SWISS-PROT pro-
teins were then assigned to those sequences from the proteomes
which they had been cross-referenced (only complete EC assign-
ments were considered in this study). Only orthologous groups
containing at least two sequences with EC assignments were ex-
amined, and a group was considered consistent with EC annota-
tion only if all EC-annotated sequences in this group were as-
signed exactly the same EC number.
