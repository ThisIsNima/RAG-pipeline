Helminths are parasitic worms. They are the most common infectious agents of humans in developing countries 
and produce a global burden of disease that exceeds better-known conditions, including malaria and tuberculosis. 
As we discuss here, new insights into fundamental helminth biology are accumulating through newly completed 
genome projects and the nascent application of transgenesis and RNA interference technologies. At the same 
time, our understanding of the dynamics of the transmission of helminths and the mechanisms of the Th2-type 
immune responses that are induced by infection with these parasitic worms has increased markedly. Ultimately, 
these advances in molecular and medical helminth biology should one day translate into a new and robust pipeline 
of drugs, diagnostics, and vaccines for targeting parasitic worms that infect humans.
Introduction
Helminths (the word is derived from the Greek meaning “worms”; 
ref. 1) have plagued humans since before the era of our earliest 
recorded history. The eggs of intestinal helminths can be found in 
the mummified feces of humans dating back thousands of years 
(2–4), and we can recognize many of the characteristic clinical 
features of helminth infections from the ancient writings of Hip-
pocrates, Egyptian medical papyri, and the Bible (2–4). These same 
helminthiases markedly altered the course of modern twentieth 
century world history (2, 4–7), especially in China during the Cold 
War, when the schistosome was known as “the blood-fluke that 
saved Formosa” (7) because acute schistosomiasis sickened Mao’s 
troops and aborted their amphibious assault of Taiwan (histori-
cally known as Formosa) just long enough for American ships to 
enter the Straits of Taiwan (5–7).
There are two major phyla of helminths. The nematodes (also 
known as roundworms) include the major intestinal worms (also 
known as soil-transmitted helminths) and the filarial worms that 
cause lymphatic filariasis (LF) and onchocerciasis, whereas the 
platyhelminths (also known as flatworms) include the flukes (also 
known as trematodes), such as the schistosomes, and the tape-
worms (also known as the cestodes), such as the pork tapeworm that 
causes cysticercosis (Table 1). In 1947, Norman Stoll published a 
landmark paper entitled “This wormy world,” in which he set out to 
estimate the number of people infected with helminths worldwide 
(8). Over the last 60 years, several estimates have confirmed Stoll’s 
initial observation that hundreds of millions of people harbor 
parasitic worms (9–11). Today, it is estimated that approximately  
one-third of the almost three billion people that live on less than 
two US dollars per day in developing regions of sub-Saharan Africa, 
Asia, and the Americas are infected with one or more helminth (12, 
13). The most common helminthiases are those caused by infec-
tion with intestinal helminths, ascariasis, trichuriasis, and hook-
worm, followed by schistosomiasis and LF (Table 1). Practically  
speaking, this means that the inhabitants of thousands of rural, 
impoverished villages throughout the tropics and subtropics are 
often chronically infected with several different species of parasitic 
worm; that is, they are polyparasitized (12, 13).
For reasons not well understood, compared with any other age 
group, school-aged children (including adolescents) and pre-
school children tend to harbor the greatest numbers of intestinal 
worms and schistosomes and as a result experience growth stunt-
ing and diminished physical fitness as well as impaired memory 
and cognition (14). These adverse health consequences combine to 
impair childhood educational performance, reduce school atten-
dance (15), and account for the observation that hookworm (and 
presumably other diseases caused by parasitic worms) reduces  
future wage-earning capacity (16). Hookworm and schistosomia-
sis are also important diseases during pregnancy, causing neo-
natal prematurity, reduced neonatal birth weight, and increased 
maternal morbidity and mortality (17). Among some adult pop-
ulations living in impoverished areas of developing countries, 
onchocerciasis is a leading cause of blindness and skin disease, 
while LF is a major cause of limb and genital deformities. LF and 
onchocerciasis, together with hookworm and schistosomiasis, 
are also major determinants of reduced worker productivity (4, 
18, 19). Such chronic, disabling, and often disfiguring effects of 
helminths translate into enormous poverty-promoting effects 
and represent a major reason why poor people remain mired in a 
downward cycle of destitution (19).
Adding to the global morbidity that results from human hel-
minth infections are the observations that they have both direct 
and indirect effects on malaria and HIV/AIDS in developing coun-
tries. In sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere, helminthiases are fre-
quently coendemic with malaria (12, 20–22) and HIV/AIDS (12, 
23–26). Indeed, it is not uncommon for an individual to be coin-
fected with the malaria-causing parasite and one or more parasitic 
worm (22), or HIV and one or more parasitic worm (25, 26). Such 
coinfections have additive effects, such as severe anemia (21), and 
synergistic effects, such as increased transmission of the malaria-
causing parasite, HIV, and/or increased susceptibility to infection

with these pathogens as well as cause an exacerbated progression 
of these two killer diseases (12, 20–26).
The high medical, educational, and economic burden of hel-
minth infections, together with their coendemicity with malaria 
and AIDS, provides an important rationale for launching a global 
assault on parasitic worms (13). However, the tools we currently 
have for controlling worm infections are limited; of the 1,556 
new chemical entities marketed between 1975 and 2004, only 
four drugs — albendazole, oxamniquine, praziquantel, and iver-
mectin — were developed to treat helminthiases (4, 27). Together 
with diethylcarbamazine (developed in the first half of the twenti-
eth century) and mebendazole, these drugs represent almost our 
entire pharmacopeia for combating the most common infections 
in the world. The dearth of available anthelminthic agents partly 
reflects the very modest commercial markets for drugs targeting 
human helminth infections and partly reflects how remarkably lit-
tle we know about the unique biochemical metabolism of parasitic 
worms and the mechanisms by which worms evade human host 
defenses, establish chronic infections, and cause adverse maternal 
and child health (14). Indeed, the diseases caused by infection with 
helminths are considered neglected tropical diseases, and the study 
of these diseases receives less than 1% of global research dollars 
(4). Despite this, as we discuss here, recent advances by molecu-
lar and immunological helminthologists have indicated that hel-
minths are a rich source of interesting molecules that could lead 
to innovation for almost all aspects of biomedicine. We hope that 
such information might one day translate into the development 
of new drugs, diagnostics, and vaccines to combat infection with 
helminths as well as influence the development of new therapeu-
tics for other human illnesses.
Epidemiology of helminth infections
With the exception of Strongyloides stercoralis, helminths do not 
replicate within the human host. This fundamental aspect of hel-
minth biology establishes a set of transmission dynamics quite 
different than those for viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. 
For example, prevalence, which is the proportion of persons in a 
defined population at a given time point infected with the hel-
minth (28), is seldom used as the only measure to assess the epide-
miological situation for that helminth infection, because morbid-
ity is associated with the number of worms infecting the host (i.e., 
the worm burden) rather than the absence or presence of infec-
tion. Prevalence is commonly combined with worm burden (also 
referred to as the “intensity of infection”), which is commonly  
measured by the number of eggs per gram (EPGs) of feces for 
intestinal helminths and schistosomes (29). Based on EPGs and 
their association with morbidity, individuals are classified into cat-
egories of light, moderate, and heavy infection by the WHO (30). 
Furthermore, in the case of soil-transmitted helminths, the WHO 
recommends use of both prevalence and intensity of infection to 
classify communities into transmission categories — category I 
(high), category II (medium), and category III (low). These trans-
mission categories are assigned according to both the number of 
heavily infected people in the community (greater or less than 
10%) and the prevalence of infection (greater or less than 50%). 
For example, a community with greater than 50% prevalence but

less than 10% heavy infection would be considered a category II  
transmission community. The WHO uses this information in 
algorithms to determine the type of mass treatment a community 
should receive. For filarial helminths, the transmission status in 
a community is determined by assessing the number of people 
with blood-circulating microfilariae or microfilarial antigen; in 
the case of onchocerciasis, it is determined by counting the num-
ber of microfilariae in a skin biopsy or even counting the number 
of palpable nodules (30). It important to note that the quantita-
tive assessment of worms provides no information on whether 
the infection represents either a recent or long-term infection nor 
does it indicate either the length or extent of exposure to infection 
(i.e., an individual residing near a source of transmission for many 
years may not necessarily have high egg count despite extensive 
exposure). There are several key determinants underlying the epi-
demiology of helminth infections.
Environment. Climate and topography are crucial determinants 
of the distribution of helminth infections (31). Helminths trans-
mitted by vectors are limited to landscapes in which host and vec-
tor come together in the same habitat, resulting highly focal dis-
tribution. For example, the distribution of schistosomiasis reflects 
the biotic and abiotic features (i.e., climatic, physical, and chemical 
factors) that affect the survival and development of the snail vector 
(32). In the case of onchocerciasis, the distribution and incidence 
of the disease are limited by biogeographic variations favorable 
to exposure to the blackfly vectors (33, 34). Soil-transmitted hel-
minths are highly affected by surface temperature (35), altitude, 
soil type, and rainfall (36, 37).
Heterogeneity. Heterogeneity in the worm burden among dif-
ferent individuals infected with the same helminth is a hallmark 
feature of helminth epidemiology (38). A consequence of such het-
erogeneity is the aggregated distribution of helminth infection in 
endemic communities, such that a small proportion of hosts are 
rapidly, frequently, and/or heavily infected (38, 39). For example, 
70% of the worm burden occurs in 15% of the infected individuals 
at a given time point (40). The aggregated distribution of helminth 
infection has led some to hypothesize that certain “wormy” people 
are “predisposed” to heavy infection from as yet undefined genetic, 
immunogenetic, ecological, behavioral, and social factors (41). Pre-
disposition refers to studies in which intensity of infection prior 
to anthelminthic treatment positively correlates with intensity of 
reinfection 12–24 months after treatment (41). The bases of both 
heterogeneity and predisposition to helminth infection have yet 
to be fully elucidated. However, among the major factors under 
consideration are age, household clustering, and genetics.
Age dependency. Much epidemiologic research has focused on 
heterogeneity in the intensity of helminth infection by age (42). 
Changes with age in the average intensity of infection tend to be 
convex, rising in childhood and declining in adulthood. For Asca-
ris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura, the heaviest and most fre-
quent infections are in children aged 5–15 years, with a decline 
in intensity and frequency in adulthood (43). Similarly, for all the 
major schistosomes, the heaviest and most frequent infections are 
in older children aged 10–15 years (44). In contrast, hookworm 
frequently exhibits a steady rise in intensity of infection with age, 
peaking in adulthood (45). Similarly, the pathologic events that 
occur with filarial infections also predominate in adulthood.
Some of the strongest evidence for protective immunity to human 
helminth infection has come from epidemiological observations 
of a “peak shift” in prevalence and intensity of infection with age 
(46). Briefly, if age-infection data are compared across host popu-
lations, the peak level of infection intensity (e.g., EPGs for intesti-
nal helminths) is higher and occurs in younger individuals when 
transmission is also higher, but the peak intensity of infection is 
lower and occurs in older individuals when transmission is lower 
(46). This shift in the peak level of infection intensity and the age 
at which this peak occurs is consistent with mathematical models 
that assume a gradually acquired protective immunity, an interpre-
tation supported by experimental studies in animals (46).
Household clustering. Evidence for household clustering of infected 
individuals exists for most diseases caused by infection with a hel-
minth, including ascariasis (47), trichuriasis (47), and strongyloi-
diasis (48, 49). This clustering can persist through time, as shown 
by familial predisposition to heavy infection with Ascaris lumbricoi-
des and Trichuris trichiura in Mexico (50). Household aggregation of 
lymphatic filarial infection (individuals with LF and/or microfila-
raemia) has been described in India and Polynesia (51, 52). In one 
study of schistosomiasis, shared household accounted for 22% of 
the variance in S. mansoni egg counts (53). There is also some evi-
dence for a similarity in antibody isotype level among family mem-
bers for crude schistosome antigen extracts, reflecting the degree to 
which this phenotype might be influenced by genetic factors (54).
Genetics. For a number of species of parasitic worms, it has been 
established that the intensity of infection is a heritable phenotype 
(55). The most advanced research program investigating the iden-
tity of host genes that influence helminth infection involves schis-
tosomiasis. The first genome scan for a helminth infection identi-
fied linkage of intensity of infection with S. mansoni in a Brazilian 
population to the chromosomal region 5q31–q33 (56), and sub-
sequent confirmation of this link was established in a Senegalese 
population (57). The 5q31–q33 region includes loci for numer-
ous immune response genes, including those encoding the Th2 
cytokines IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13, interferon regulatory 
factor 1, colony-stimulating factor 2, colony-stimulating factor 1 
receptor, and the IL-12/IL-23 p40 subunit (55). Genes controlling 
IgE production, asthma, malaria parasitaemia, and inflammatory 
bowel disease, among others, have also been mapped to this region 
of chromosome 5, although the causative polymorphisms have 
not yet been identified.
Polyparasitism. Finally, an increasing number of studies of helminth 
epidemiology have shown that it is common for individuals to be 
infected with more than one species of helminth (21, 58–63). There 
is also evidence suggesting synergism and antagonism in concur-
rent intestinal nematode and schistosome infections (62–64) as well 
as filarial nematode infection and soil-transmitted helminth infec-
tions (65). A number of epidemiological studies have indicated that 
individuals infected with multiple species of helminth often harbor 
heavier infections than individuals infected with a single helminth 
species (58–61). An important consequence of simultaneous infec-
tion with the parasites that cause hookworm, schistosomiasis, and 
malaria is severe anemia (21, 66). It has also been speculated that hel-
minth infections may adversely influence host immune responses  
to the malaria-causing parasite and other pathogens (20).
Burden of helminthiases
Most helminth infections, if left untreated, result in multi-year, 
chronic inflammatory disorders that cause both concurrent and 
delayed-onset pathology to the afflicted human host (67–69). 
In addition to the overt and dramatic effects of blindness and 
elephantiasis in individuals with onchocerciasis and LF, respec-

tively, it is now appreciated that chronic helminth infections are 
also linked to more insidious persistent health conditions such as 
anemia, growth stunting, protein-calorie undernutrition, fatigue, 
and poor cognitive development (68). These seemingly subtle and 
often overlooked morbidities are very important because of the 
high prevalence of helminthiases in the rural developing world, in 
which any health impairment is substantially magnified in terms 
of degradation of individual patient performance status (70).
Initially, in childhood, it is the presence of helminth infection 
and the intensity of infection that determine the risk for disease 
formation. It is also true that for many of the tissue-invasive hel-
minths, such as the schistosomes and filariae, tissue damage can 
continue into later adult life, with disease persisting and even 
increasing long after the infection is cleared. As such, measures 
of infection prevalence do not capture the prevalence of infection-
associated disease, particularly in adult life. Conditions such as 
elephantiasis, which occurs in individuals with LF; visual impair-
ment, which occurs in individuals with onchocerciasis; peripor-
tal fibrosis and hypertension, which occur in individuals with 
intestinal schistosomiasis; biliary obstruction, cholangitis, and 
cholangiocarcinoma, which occur in individuals with food-borne 
trematodiasis; and urinary obstruction and bladder cancer, which 
occur in individuals with urinary schistosomiasis, are potentially 
the most life-threatening consequences of helminth infections. 
Although most likely to contribute to hospitalization and to cause 
mortality, these advanced outcomes are rare when compared to 
the disease burden of the average patient, which is characterized 
by the subacute morbidities detailed earlier.
The temporal lag between initial high-intensity childhood 
infection and the delayed onset of “classical” parasite-associated 
pathologic findings have led to a serious underappreciation of the 
day-to-day burden of helminthic diseases. In international health 
assessments based on the disability-adjusted life year (DALY) met-
ric (71), DALY calculations are weighted to stress diseases preva-
lent among adults in the 20–40 age group, and therefore diseases 
arising primarily in childhood carry far less weight (72). In the cur-
rent Global Burden of Disease (GBD) assessments by the WHO, 
it is not clear whether prevalence of infection per se was used to 
gauge the disease burden of helminths or the more appropriate 
duration of infection-associated pathology, which is often irrevers-
ible. The DALY disability weights assigned to specific helminth 
infections were developed by nonpatient committees based on 
disease scenarios that did not reflect what we now appreciate as 
the full spectrum of helminth infection–associated pathology (71). 
Although efforts are underway to revise the GBD assessments (73), 
it is important that we do not underestimate the substantial dis-
ease burden of more than one billion individuals worldwide who 
are affected by helminth infections.
A new focus for assessing the health burden related to helmin-
thic diseases has been the adoption of patient-based quality-of-life 
(QoL) interview techniques for assessing disease burden across 
many international settings (74, 75). Although health-related QoL 
is in some sense a cultural construct, and subjective adaptation 
to physical impairments is likely to vary from region to region, 
certain universal features of disease impact can be identified. 
Implementation of QoL assessment for most prevalent diseases, 
and the subsequent use of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for 
comparison of disease impacts (76), is likely to provide the most 
useful comparison of disease burdens across different societies 
and their economies.
Helminth immunobiology
The reduction in the intensity of some human helminth infections 
with age might be indicative of host immunity. Immune responses  
to helminths are intriguing not only from the perspectives of 
understanding protective immunity and immunopathology, but 
also because a major branch of the mammalian immune system, 
type 2 immunity, seems to have evolved specifically to deal with 
this class of pathogens. Type 2 immunity involves the rapid activa-
tion and engagement of cells of both the innate (eosinophils and 
basophils) and adaptive (CD4+ T cells that commit to the Th2 path-
way) immune systems (77). Cells of both the innate and adaptive 
immune systems that are involved in type 2 immunity share the 
ability to synthesize the core type 2 cytokine IL-4, which mediates 
(both directly and indirectly) the reactions that historically have 
been considered to be symptomatic of helminth infection such as 
IgE production, eosinophilia, and changes in the physiology of tar-
get organs (e.g., the intestine and lungs) that are associated with 
goblet cell hyperplasia and smooth muscle contraction (78).
Based on findings from studies of infections in humans and 
mouse models of helminth infections, we know that, depending 
on the infection in question, type 2 immune responses can prevent 
the survival of infecting parasites during a homologous secondary 
infection (79), expel adult parasites from the gut (78), allow host 
survival in a setting where the immune response cannot clear the 
parasites (80), and/or mediate pathological fibrotic responses (81). 
Fibrosis has its origins in the wound-healing responses that must 
be required on an ongoing basis in animals chronically infected 
with pathogens that cause large amounts of tissue damage, such 
as most helminths (82).
In key ways, our understanding of type 2 immunity has lagged 
behind that of type 1 immunity (which encompasses Th1 cells) and 
even of the more recently defined Th17 cells and Tregs. In each of 
these cases, a set of cytokines made by cells of the innate immune 
system, often in response to the ligation of TLRs by a component 
of a pathogen, strongly promotes the development of defined 
CD4+ T cell lineages that in productive immune responses are 
appropriate to the particular situation. Thus, we know that IFN-γ 
and IL-12 can promote Th1 responses; TGF-β, IL-6, and IL-23 can 
promote Th17 cell development; and TGF-β alone plays a role in 
driving Treg development (83, 84). Although we know that IL-4 
and IL-13 are important for Th2 cell development, the production 
of these cytokines by innate immune cells seems to play little part 
in promoting the initiation of Th2 responses, and it has been clear 
that other crucial, yet ill-defined, conditions are important in this 
process. Recent work in type 2 immunity, largely involving excel-
lent mouse models of human helminthiases and studies of allergy 
and asthma, which share with helminth infections an association 
with type 2 immune responses, has begun to shed light on some 
of these issues. For example, it is now clear that in addition to IL-4,  
IL-13, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-10, Th2 cells can make IL-25 and IL-31, 
and that these two cytokines can have crucial roles in promoting 
and/or regulating Th2 immune responses (85, 86). There have also 
been substantial developments in understanding how the induc-
tion of type 2 immune responses is influenced by other cells, spe-
cifically through the recognition that thymic stromal lymphopoi-
etin (TSLP), synthesized by epithelial cells, can condition dendritic 
cells to promote Th2 cell development (87). Lastly, there has been 
considerable progress in identifying genes that are expressed in 
response to stimulation by cytokines produced by Th2 cells and 
in defining the roles of the products of these genes as effectors of

Th2 immunity as well as inducers and regulators of Th2 immune 
responses. Among these gene products are intelectins, arginases, 
resistin-like molecules (RELMs), and chitinases (88). Indeed, the 
coordinated production of members of the latter three classes of 
molecules by macrophages exposed to IL-4 and/or IL-13 is a fea-
ture of the “alternative activation” pathway executed by these cells 
during helminth infections. This is an area of great current interest 
(89), especially since recent reports have highlighted the protective 
effects of these cells during helminth infections (80, 90).
How more recently discovered components of type 2 immune 
responses, such as IL-25 and IL-31, participate in host protective 
and immunopathologic processes is only just beginning to be 
examined using helminth infections in the mouse (91–94), and 
little has been done as of yet to explore these pathways in humans 
infected with helminths. This is a target area for emphasis in 
immunologic research on helminths in the near future, both in 
terms of increasing our understanding of the basic immunobiol-
ogy of infections with these parasites, but also and more impor-
tantly, as a means to improve attempts directed toward the ratio-
nal development of vaccines and immunotherapeutics.
Many helminthiases are chronic diseases, and it remains unclear 
how the Th2 immune response is regulated during the course of 
these long-term infections, during which antigen loads remain 
high and pathology is, at least in part, immune mediated (95). 
There is great interest in the possibility that Tregs play a role in 
these processes, perhaps in combination with unusual immuno-
regulatory helminth-derived products (96), and that such regula-
tion underlies the reverse correlations between infection with a 
helminth and asthma, allergy, and certain autoimmune diseases 
that have been reported in a growing number of studies (some-
thing that is known as the hygiene hypothesis) (97, 98). This 
remains a key area for further exploration, not only in the hope 
that understanding the regulatory response will allow interven-
tion to enhance immune responses and decrease infection, but 
also because of the potential therapeutic use of helminth regu-
latory strategies for other disorders. Indeed, understanding how 
helminth infections regulate inflammation could promote new 
approaches for the development of therapeutics for a wide variety 
of inflammatory conditions.
Helminth genomics, postgenomics,  
and gene manipulation
Deciphering the genetic code of helminth parasites will allow us 
to understand the fundamental nature of these pathogens and the 
pathogenesis of the diseases that they cause. Genetic manipulation 
of helminth genomes, including transgenesis approaches, offers 
a means to determine the importance of specific helminth genes 
in disease pathogenesis, including those that could be targeted by 
novel therapeutic interventions.
Genomics. Helminth parasites have large complex genomes. In gen-
eral, for both nematodes and platyhelminths, genome size ranges  
from approximately 50 to 500 Mb, with up to 20,000 protein-
encoding genes. This genome size is comparable to that of insects. 
Several helminth parasites have become the focus of endeavors aim-
ing to determine entire genome sequences. Information from these 
sequencing projects will facilitate determination of function and 
importance of genes or groups of genes in cellular and biochemical 
pathways and their role in the host-parasite relationship.
It is anticipated the complete genomes of Schistosoma mansoni and 
Schistosoma japonicum will be reported within the next year (99), fol-
lowing the release recently of reasonably comprehensive descrip-
tions of their transcriptomes (100, 101) and the proteome of  
S. japonicum (102). Schistosomes have sizeable genomes. The hap-
loid genome of S. mansoi is estimated to be approximately 300 Mb, 
arrayed on seven pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromo-
somes (103). For comparison, this genome size is about ten times 
that of the genome of the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium fal-
ciparum and one-tenth the size of the human genome. Schistosoma 
haematobium and S. japonicum, the other major schistosome species 
that parasitize humans probably have a genome size similar to that 
of S. mansoni, based on the similarity of their karyotypes (103). The 
S. mansoni genome is AT-rich (60%–70% AT in the euchromatin), 
replete with repetitive sequences. The approximately 13,000 pro-
tein-encoding genes include several, sometimes numerous, introns 
ranging in size from small to very large. The complexity of the pro-
teome is expanded by the presence of single nucleotide polymor-
phisms, trans-splicing of a subset of the transcriptome, and alterna-
tive splicing of some genes (reviewed in ref. 104).
The draft genome sequence of the filarial nematode parasite Brugia 
malayi was reported recently (105). This was a landmark in human 
parasitology as it represented the first genome sequence of a para-
sitic helminth to be deciphered. B. malayi has a genome of 90 Mb, 
with a compliment of 14,500–17,800 protein-encoding genes. As in 
the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and many bacteria, a 
number of the B. malayi genes are organized into operons — units of 
transcription wherein several genes are regulated by the same pro-
moter, thereby enabling the cell or organism to facilitate global gene 
expression in response to stimuli and environmental conditions.
The genome sequence of no parasitic nematode other than  
B. malayi has been completed. However, the draft genome sequence 
for B. malayi offers a broad foundation for rational intervention 
for both filariae and parasitic nematodes at large. Comprehensive 
analyses of the transcriptomes and genomes of a number of other 
medically important parasites, including hookworms and Trichi-
nella spiralis, are in progress (106, 107). Through both genomics 
and more conventional biochemical methodologies, bioactive pro-
teins with remarkable therapeutic potential have been identified 
and isolated from hookworms and other nematodes (reviewed in 
ref. 108). These include a novel factor VIIa/tissue factor inhibitor 
and a neutrophil inhibitory factor, which have undergone clinical 
trials with beneficial and promising outcomes for human throm-
botic disease (109–112). These successes serve to emphasize that 
genomic studies of the parasitic helminths are likely to lead to new 
treatments for disease, including diseases not directly caused by 
helminth pathogens.
Gene manipulation by RNA interference. Until recently, gene manip-
ulation approaches had not been seriously considered as tools to 
learn more about helminth-encoded proteins that might be inter-
vention targets. This situation is now changing in response to the 
availability of genome sequences and other advances. RNAi tech-
nology has revolutionized investigation of the role and importance 
of genes in model organisms such as C. elegans. Methods developed 
for RNAi in C. elegans are now being deployed in schistosomes 
and some parasitic nematodes. Skelly and coworkers established 
the feasibility of experimental RNAi in S. mansoni by describing 
knockdown of the gut-associated cysteine protease cathepsin B 
by soaking larval schistosomes in dsRNA that effects RNAi (113). 
Krautz-Peterson et al. extended these studies by comparing and 
optimizing RNAi methodology (114). They reported that square-
wave electroporation was dramatically more efficient than either

soaking the parasites in an equivalent dsRNA dose or soaking 
them in an equivalent dsRNA dose in the presence of liposomes. 
They also demonstrated that small, interfering RNAs were as 
effective as longer dsRNAs. Other reports have confirmed the util-
ity of RNAi in schistosomes to address gene function and impor-
tance (115–117). Indeed, RNAi has been used to demonstrate a 
crucial role for S. mansoni inhibin/activin (SmInAct; a member 
of the TGF-β receptor family) in embryogenesis; knockdown of 
SmInAct expression in eggs aborts their development (118). Given 
that eggs are responsible for the pathology of schistosomiasis, 
this protein is a potential therapeutic intervention target. As gene 
silencing by RNAi in schistosomes has been reported to deliver a 
specific effect, with no obvious or widespread nonspecific effects 
on nontarget genes, gene manipulation by RNAi might have wide 
applicability and promote functional schistosome genomics. The 
latter are expected to improve our knowledge of the function of 
schistosome gene products and lead to new interventions for 
treatment and control.
In contrast to work with schistosomes, RNAi in parasitic nema-
todes has had limited success or has been unsuccessful (119, 120). 
Given the importance of RNAi in revolutionizing our understand-
ing of the biology of the C. elegans, this overall lack of success for 
parasitic nematodes has so far been a disappointment for the 
molecular helminthology community. The physiological basis for 
the poor performance of RNAi in parasitic nematodes might relate 
to an absence of pivotal RNAi pathway components, as evidenced 
by the absence in B. malayi of the gene encoding the Sid-1 mem-
brane channel that is involved in dsRNA uptake (105, 121).
Transgenesis. Gain-of-function approaches with reporter trans-
genes, for example transgenes encoding either jellyfish GFP or 
firefly luciferase, have also been investigated in parasitic worms. 
Monitoring the expression of the reporter protein provides infor-
mation on the progress of the transgenesis procedures. In para-
sitic nematodes, reporter gene activity driven by exogenous and 
endogenous gene promoters has been demonstrated in B. malayi, 
S. stercoralis, and Parastrongyloides trichosuri (122–124). In addition, 
heritable transmission of plasmid-based transgenes has been 
reported (123, 124). Similar findings have been described in schis-
tosomes, and stage- and tissue-specific expression of schistosome 
genes has been investigated using reporter transgenes driven by 
the promoters of schistosome genes, including cathepsin L (125). 
Recently, Brindley and coworkers have described somatic trans-
genesis of S. mansoni facilitated by either the piggyBac transposon 
(126) or the murine leukemia retrovirus (127), including the first 
demonstration of integration of reporter genes into the chromo-
somes of a parasitic worm.
Proteomics, glycomics, and metabolomics. Proteomic analyses in par-
asitic helminths are not as advanced as genomic or transcriptomic 
studies, but these aspects, along with glycomics and metabolomics, 
have now begun to be addressed. For example, proteomic analysis 
of the tegument of adults, the excreted and secreted products of 
adults, and the egg shells of S. japonicum and S. mansoni have yield-
ed several thousand proteins, many of which have been putatively 
identified and many of which are much more closely related to 
the orthologous host proteins than to orthologs of invertebrates 
(102, 128). Proteomic investigations have also revealed differences 
between the secretome of Trichinella spiralis and that of Trichinella 
pseudospiralis (129) as well as the plasticity of the proteome of gut-
dwelling nematodes in response to immunological pressure (130). 
Glycomics will provide information about the glycan structures of 
helminths that are known to mediate and modulate host immu-
nological responses to these parasites (131, 132). Moreover, tech-
niques from developmental biology and other disciplines, such as 
whole mount in situ hybridization (WISH) and gene microarrays, 
have now been established as crucial tools for investigating the 
function of helminth genes and proteins (133–135).
Global control of helminthiases  
and clinical research imperatives
Beginning with the widespread use of the drug diethylcarbamazine 
for the treatment of LF in China during the 1970s, the mass treat-
ment of human populations with anthelminthic drugs, known as 
mass drug administration (MDA), has been a major approach to 
controlling human helminthiases in developing countries (13). 
During the late 1980s, the first public-private partnership was 
formed to provide MDA of ivermectin to African populations at 
risk for onchocerciasis (13), and since then the mainstay of global 
worm control has been MDA of anthelminthic drugs through the 
activities of public-private partnerships, using either drugs donated  
by multinational corporations or low-cost generic drugs (Table 2). 
An important stimulus for these partnerships has been a series of 
resolutions adopted at the World Health Assembly — the major 
decision-making body for the WHO, which meets annually and 
is attended by delegates from each member nation — calling for 
MDA to control or eliminate one or more helminth infections of 
global importance. Since 2006, several partnerships committed 
to MDA have formed an alliance, which is known as the Global 
Network for Neglected Tropical Diseases and aims to increase effi-
ciencies and produce economies of scale by delivering a package of 
drugs that simultaneously targets the six most common human 
helminthiases (ascariasis, trichuriasis, hookworm, schistosomia-
sis, LF, and onchocerciasis) as well as trachoma (13). Because of its 
low cost and cost savings, integrated helminth control has become 
highly attractive to both global policy makers and donors.
In resource-poor settings with a substantial burden of helmin-
thiases, it has become a common practice during MDA to treat 
individuals regardless of whether or not they are currently infect-
ed with the disease-causing parasitic worm. However, based on a 
mixed legacy of relying on drugs to control or eliminate a wide-
spread infectious disease, such as malaria, there are concerns that 
emerging drug resistance or other factors could derail global efforts 
to implement MDA, integrated or otherwise (13). These concerns, 
together with a need to better understand a number of fundamen-
tal clinical and epidemiological aspects of human helminth infec-
tions as well as their interactions with geographically overlapping 
coinfections (e.g., malaria and HIV/AIDS) have created an urgency 
for stepped up clinical research activities as they relate to large-
scale helminth control. Such activities have focused around three 
major areas: first, a reexamination of the health impact of human 
helminthic infections, with particular interest in the effects of 
mono- and polyparasitism on childhood growth and develop-
ment as well as their effects on pregnancy and birth outcomes (63, 
136–140); second, large-scale monitoring and evaluation of MDA 
and integrated control, along with operational research with goals 
to improve the access of populations to anthelminthic drugs and 
to monitor for possible drug resistance (141–145); and third, the 
development of new tools to control helminth infections, that is, 
drugs, diagnostics, and vaccines (19, 146).
For purposes of MDA and integrated control efforts, current 
synthesis of the available study data has culminated in a recently

issued set of WHO guidelines (147). Parallel studies are examining 
the added benefits of micronutrient supplementation, particularly 
in combating the anemias associated with hookworm and schisto-
somiasis (148, 149). Other studies are specifically examining the 
impact of infection among women who are pregnant and women 
of child-bearing age, risk groups who are often excluded from MDA 
because of fears of fetal toxicity (136, 150, 151), or they are examin-
ing the early developmental effects of helminthic infections among 
preschool children (152). Despite the evident success of MDA, limi-
tations have been observed in the effectiveness of treatment in some 
field settings, and concern has been raised about the potential for 
emergence of resistance to the mainstay drugs of MDA programs, 
including the benzimidazole anthelminthic, used predominantly 
to combat soil-transmitted helminth infections, and ivermectin, 
which is used to combat filarial infections (146, 153–158). How-
ever, with the exceptions of β-tubulin as a biomarker to determine 
nematode resistance to the benzimidazoles mebendazole and 
albendazole (159) and possibly ABC transporters and β-tubulin 
as biomarkers for determining resistance to ivermectin and other 
macrocyclic lactones (160), we lack robust biomarkers for detecting 
resistance to most anthelminthic drugs.
Despite the remarkable successes of MDA programs, disease 
elimination is often not obtained in highly endemic areas, and 
research on new drugs (and means for their successful imple-
mentation) is clearly needed to maintain and expand effective 
control. In the coming decade, the mining of newly completed 
helminth genomes should help to facilitate the discovery of new 
anthelminthic drugs. In the meantime, recent animal and clinical 
studies have documented the efficacy of artemether compounds 
for treating the early phases of schistosome infection (161) and a 
new broad-spectrum agent known as tribendimidine for treating 
soil-transmitted helminth infections (162). New classes of cyste-
ine protease inhibitors are being developed as anthelminthic and 
antiprotozoal drugs (163), and other studies have indicated the 
efficacy of triclabendazole for infection with the difficult to treat 
liver fluke Fasciola hepatica (164, 165). Human and animal stud-
ies also suggest that tribendimidine will prove effective against 
food-borne flukes (166) and the drug moxidectin might become 
an alternative to ivermectin for the treatment of filarial infections 
(167). Finally, based on the observation that the filarial parasites 
Wuchereria bancrofti and Onchocerca volvulus harbor bacterial endo-
symbionts of the genus Wolbachia and depend on these endosym-
bionts for normal metabolic and reproductive activities, there is 
excitement about the development and use of antibiotics to target 
adult filarial worms (168). This is of particular importance because 
to date there is no effective drug that targets the adult stage of 
these parasitic worms.
In parallel with drug discovery efforts are two anthelminthic 
vaccine development efforts, each conducted by a dedicated prod-
uct-development partnership. For hookworm, the high rate of 
drug failure for single-dose mebendazole as well as rapid reinfec-
tion and the possible emergence of drug-resistant parasites have 
stimulated efforts by the Human Hookworm Vaccine Initiative 
to develop a bivalent vaccine comprised of recombinant hook-
worm vaccine antigens that target the infective larval stages and 
adult blood-feeding stages (146, 169, 170). Currently, one larval 
antigen is being evaluated in a phase 1 clinical trial in a region of 
Brazil that is endemic for hookworm and a second adult hook-
worm antigen is about to enter into clinical trials (170). Related 
antigens are also being used to develop recombinant onchocer-
ciasis vaccines (171). In addition, the Institut Pasteur is conduct-
ing clinical trials in sub-Saharan Africa using a recombinant 
vaccine (encoding a glutathione S-transferase) to protect against 
infection with S. haematobium (172). A surface protein encoding a 
novel tetraspanin is also awaiting early development as a vaccine 
to protect against infection with S. mansoni (173). Ultimately, it 
is anticipated that anthelminthic vaccines are likely to be used 
alongside drugs in an integrated program linking vaccination 
with chemotherapy (146, 174).
Concluding comments
The recent developments in molecular and medical helminthology 
could relatively soon be translated into a new generation of anthel-
minthic therapeutics. Based on advances in schistosome genom-
ics, a family of promising schistosome vaccine antigens has already 
been identified (173) and ultimately could be formulated into a 
schistosomiasis vaccine. Such a vaccine could be used together 
with a hookworm vaccine. At the same time, the recently revealed 
importance of Wolbachia endosymbionts is helping to launch new 
drug discovery efforts for the treatment of LF and onchocerciasis

as well as treatment programs based on either existing or new anti-
biotics (168). The recent completion of the filarial genome might 
soon yield additional drug targets (105). Revelations within the 
last five years about the impact of helminthiases on the transmis-
sion of the pathogens that cause malaria and HIV/AIDS and on 
the progression of these diseases (12), suggest that deworming and 
other large-scale anthelminthic measures might promote impor-
tant “back-door” approaches for controlling them (12, 13).
At the same time, our enthusiasm for seeing helminthological 
science translate into new interventions needs to be tempered 
because of some sobering elements. First, despite these new 
advances, overall, we are still at a relatively nascent stage of hel-
minth translational research and development. The development 
of in vitro methodologies and high throughput technologies for 
studying helminths has not, for the most part, kept up with the 
generation of parasitic helminth genomic and other bioinformatic 
databases. Until there is greater investment of scientific horsepower  
and funds into fundamental helminthology research, we are still 
a way off using the reverse genomic and vaccinology approaches 
that have benefited modern bacteriology. Second, because worm 
infections occur almost exclusively among the poorest people of 
the world, there are no market incentives for mining bioinfor-
matic databases for anthelminthic drug and vaccine discovery. 
Therefore, unless there is financial innovation for the poor or a 
paradigm shift by the multinationals in orphan drug development 
for developing countries, we must either rely on the existing vet-
erinary pipeline of new anthelminthics feeding into the human 
pipeline or we need to expand the role of nonprofit product-devel-
opment partnerships (4, 13, 146). Critical to the success of new 
anthelminthic interventions is likely be North-South partnerships 
with so-called “innovative developing countries,” i.e., economically  
disadvantaged nations endemic for neglected tropical diseases 
such as Brazil, China, and India, which have nonetheless achieved 
a high level of biotechnological sophistication (175). Third, until 
vaccines or new drugs are developed for human helminthiases, 
we must rely on a tiny pharmacopeia of existing drugs. Currently, 
integrated control of the six most common human helminthia-
ses, which affect approximately one billion people in developing 
countries, depends on the availability and effectiveness of just four 
drugs — albendazole, mebendazole, praziquantel, and ivermectin. 
Adequate resources need to be set aside for the development of 
genetic resistance markers and for careful monitoring and evalu-
ation of large scale programs if we are to preserve these agents as 
public health control tools. Finally, in the absence adequate of new 
support for helminthology training, we risk losing a generation of 
whole-organism scientists who have the skills to study both the 
parasites and the diseases they cause. Because of the enormous 
benefits in human capital that would result from investing in 
the study of fundamental and translational helminthology and 
because access to anthelminthic interventions has now been rec-
ognized as a fundamental human right (176), we believe that now, 
more than ever, the scientific and global public health communi-
ties should address the neglected status of the helminthiases and 
prioritize their study.
