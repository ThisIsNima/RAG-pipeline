Genome sequence and analysis of the
tuber crop potato
The Potato Genome Sequencing Consortium*
Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is the world’s most important non-grain food crop and is central to global food security. It
is clonally propagated, highly heterozygous, autotetraploid, and suffers acute inbreeding depression. Here we use a
homozygous doubled-monoploid potato clone to sequence and assemble 86% of the 844-megabase genome. We predict
39,031 protein-coding genes and present evidence for at least two genome duplication events indicative of a
palaeopolyploid origin. As the first genome sequence of an asterid, the potato genome reveals 2,642 genes specific to
this large angiosperm clade. We also sequenced a heterozygous diploid clone and show that gene presence/absence
variants and other potentially deleterious mutations occur frequently and are a likely cause of inbreeding depression.
Gene family expansion, tissue-specific expression and recruitment of genes to new pathways contributed to the
evolution of tuber development. The potato genome sequence provides a platform for genetic improvement of this
vital crop.
Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is a member of the Solanaceae, an
economically important familythatincludes tomato, pepper, aubergine
(eggplant), petunia and tobacco. Potato belongs to the asterid clade of
eudicot plants that represents ,25% of flowering plant species and
fromwhich a complete genomesequence has not yet,toour knowledge,
been published. Potato occupies a wide eco-geographical range1 and is
uniqueamongthemajorworldfoodcrops inproducingstolons(under-
ground stems) that under suitable environmental conditions swell to
formtubers.Itsworldwideimportance,especiallywithinthedeveloping
world, isgrowing rapidly, with production in 2009 reaching 330 million
tons (http://www.fao.org). The tubers are a globally important dietary
source of starch, protein, antioxidants and vitamins2, serving the plant
asbothastorageorganandavegetativepropagationsystem.Despitethe
importance of tubers, the evolutionary and developmental mechanisms
of their initiation and growth remain elusive.
Outside of its natural range in South America, the cultivated potato
is considered to have a narrow genetic base resulting originally from
limited germplasm introductions to Europe. Most potato cultivars are
autotetraploid (2n 5 4x 5 48), highly heterozygous, suffer acute
inbreeding depression, and are susceptible to many devastating pests
and pathogens, as exemplified by the Irish potato famine in the mid-
nineteenth century. Together, these attributes present a significant
barrier to potato improvement using classical breeding approaches.
A challenge to the scientific community is to obtain a genome
sequence that will ultimately facilitate advances in breeding.
To overcome the key issue of heterozygosity and allow us to gen-
erate a high-quality draft potato genome sequence, we used a unique
homozygous form of potato called a doubled monoploid, derived
using classical tissue culture techniques3. The draft genome sequence
from this genotype, S. tuberosum group Phureja DM1-3 516 R44
(hereafter referred to as DM), was used to integrate sequence data
from a heterozygous diploid breeding line, S. tuberosum group
Tuberosum RH89-039-16 (hereafter referred to as RH). These two
genotypes represent a sample of potato genomic diversity; DM with
its fingerling (elongated) tubers was derived from a primitive South
American cultivar whereas RH more closely resembles commercially
cultivated tetraploid potato. The combined data resources, allied to
deep transcriptome sequence from both genotypes, allowed us to
explore potato genome structure and organization, as well as key
aspects of the biology and evolution of this important crop.
Genome assembly and annotation
We sequenced the nuclear and organellar genomes of DM using a
whole-genome shotgun sequencing (WGS) approach. We generated
96.6 Gb of raw sequence from two next-generation sequencing (NGS)
platforms, Illumina Genome Analyser and Roche Pyrosequencing, as
well as conventional Sanger sequencing technologies. The genome
was assembled using SOAPdenovo4, resulting in a final assembly of
727 Mb, of which 93.9% is non-gapped sequence. Ninety per cent of
the assembly falls into 443 superscaffolds larger than 349 kb. The 17-
nucleotide depth distribution (Supplementary Fig. 1) suggests a gen-
ome size of 844 Mb, consistent with estimates from flow cytometry5.
Our assembly of 727 Mb is 117 Mb less than the estimated genome
size. Analysis of the DM scaffolds indicates 62.2% repetitive content in
the assembled section of the DM genome, less than the 74.8% esti-
mated from bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) and fosmid end
sequences (Supplementary Table 1), indicating that much of the unas-
sembled genome is composed of repetitive sequences.
We assessed the quality of the WGS assembly through alignment to
Sanger-derived phase 2 BAC sequences. In an alignment length of
,1 Mb (99.4% coverage), no gross assembly errors were detected
(Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2). Alignment of
fosmid and BAC paired-end sequences to the WGS scaffolds revealed
limited (#0.12%) potential misassemblies (Supplementary Table 3).
Extensive coverage of the potato genome in this assembly was con-
firmed using available expressed sequence tag (EST) data; 97.1% of
181,558 available Sanger-sequenced S. tuberosum ESTs (.200 bp)
were detected. Repetitive sequences account for at least 62.2% of the
assembled genome (452.5 Mb) (Supplementary Table 1) with long
terminal repeat retrotransposons comprising the majority of the
transposable element classes, representing 29.4% of the genome. In
addition, subtelomeric repeats were identified at or near chromo-
somal ends (Fig. 1). Using a newly constructed genetic map based
on 2,603 polymorphic markers in conjunction with other available

genetic and physical maps, we genetically anchored 623 Mb (86%) of
the assembled genome (Supplementary Fig. 3), and constructed pseu-
domolecules for each of the 12 chromosomes (Fig. 1), which harbour
90.3% of the predicted genes.
To aid annotation and address a series of biological questions, we
generated 31.5 Gb of RNA-Seq data from 32 DM and 16 RH libraries
representing all major tissue types, developmental stages and res-
ponses to abiotic and biotic stresses (Supplementary Table 4). For
annotation, reads were mapped against the DM genome sequence
(90.2% of 824,621,408 DM reads and 88.6% of 140,375,647 RH reads)
and in combination with ab initio gene prediction, protein and EST
alignments, we annotated 39,031 protein-coding genes. RNA-Seq
data revealed alternative splicing; 9,875 genes (25.3%) encoded two
or more isoforms, indicative of more functional variation than re-
presented by the gene set alone. Overall, 87.9% of the gene models
were supported by transcript and/or protein similarity with only
12.1% derived solely from ab initio gene predictions (Supplemen-
tary Table 5).
Karyotypes of RH and DM suggested similar heterochromatin
content6 (Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Fig. 4) with
large blocks of heterochromatin located at the pericentromeric
regions (Fig. 1). As observed in other plant genomes, there was an
inverse relationship between gene density and repetitive sequences
(Fig. 1). However, many predicted genes in heterochromatic regions
are expressed, consistent with observations in tomato7 that genic
‘islands’ are present in the heterochromatic ‘ocean’.
Genome evolution
Potato is the first sequenced genome of an asterid, a clade within
eudicots that encompasses nearly 70,000 species characterized by
unique morphological, developmental and compositional features8.
Orthologous clustering of the predicted potato proteome with 11 other
green plant genomes revealed 4,479potato genes in 3,181 families in
common (Fig. 2a); 24,051 potato genes clustered with at least one of
the 11 genomes. Filtering against transposable elements and 153
nonasterid and 57 asterid publicly available transcript-sequence data
sets yielded 2,642 high-confidence asterid-specific and 3,372 potato-
lineage-specific genes (Supplementary Fig. 5); both sets were enriched
for genes of unknown function that had less expression support than
the core Viridiplantae genes. Genes encoding transcription factors,
self-incompatibility, and defence-related proteins were evident in the
asterid-specific gene set (Supplementary Table 7) and presumably con-
tribute to the unique characteristics of asterids.
Structurally, we identified 1,811 syntenic gene blocks involving
10,046 genes in the potato genome (Supplementary Table 8). On
the basis of these pairwise paralogous segments, we calculated an
age distribution based on the number of transversions at fourfold
degenerate sites (4DTv) for all duplicate pairs. In general, two signifi-
cant groups of blocks are seen in the potato genome (4DTv ,0.36 and
,1.0; Fig. 2b), suggesting two whole-genome duplication (WGD)
events. We also identified collinear blocks between potato and three
rosid genomes (Vitis vinifera, Arabidopsis thaliana and Populus
trichocarpa) that also suggest both events (Fig. 2c and Supplemen-
tary Fig. 6). The ancient WGD corresponds to the ancestral hexaploi-
dization (c) event in grape (Fig. 2b), consistent with a previous report
based on EST analysis that the two main branches of eudicots, the
asterids and rosids, may share the same palaeo-hexaploid duplication
event9. The c event probably occurred after the divergence between
dicots and monocots about 185 6 55 million years ago10. The recent
duplication can therefore be placed at ,67 million years ago, consist-
ent with the WGD that occurred near the Cretaceous–Tertiary
boundary (,65 million years ago)11. The divergence of potato and
grape occurred at ,89 million years ago (4DTv ,0.48), which is likely
to represent the split between the rosids and asterids.
Haplotype diversity
High heterozygosity and inbreeding depression are inherent to
potato, a species that predominantly outcrosses and propagates by
means of vegetative organs. Indeed, the phenotypes of DM and RH
differ, with RH more vigorous than DM (Fig. 3a). To explore the
extent of haplotype diversity and possible causes of inbreeding
depression, we sequenced and assembled 1,644 RH BAC clones gen-
erating 178 Mb of non-redundant sequence from both haplotypes
(,10% of the RH genome with uneven coverage) (Supplementary
Tables 9–11). After filtering to remove repetitive sequences, we
aligned 99 Mb of RH sequence (55%) to the DM genome. These
regions were largely collinear with an overall sequence identity of
97.5%, corresponding to one single-nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) every 40 bp and one insertion/deletion (indel) every 394 bp
(average length 12.8 bp). Between the two RH haplotypes, 6.6 Mb of
sequence could be aligned with 96.5% identity, corresponding to 1
SNP per 29 bp and 1 indel per 253 bp (average length 10.4 bp).
Current algorithms are of limited use in de novo whole-genome
assembly or haplotype reconstruction of highly heterozygous genomes

such as RH, as shown by K-mer frequency count histograms (Fig. 3b
and Supplementary Table 12). To complement the BAC-level compar-
ative analysis and provide a genome-wide perspective of heterozygosity
in RH, we mapped 1,118 million whole-genome NGS reads from RH
(843 coverage) onto the DM assembly. A total of 457.3 million reads
uniquely aligned providing 90.6% (659.1Mb) coverage. We identified
3.67 million SNPs between DM and one or both haplotypes of RH, with
an error rate of 0.91% based on evaluation of RH BAC sequences. We
usedthisdatasettoexplorethepossiblecauses ofinbreeding depression
by quantifying the occurrence of premature stop, frameshift and pres-
ence/absence variants12,asthesedisablegenefunctionand contributeto
genetic load (Supplementary Tables 13–16). We identified 3,018 SNPs
predicted to induce premature stop codons in RH, with 606 homo-
zygous (in both haplotypes) and 2,412 heterozygous. In DM, 940 pre-
mature stop codons were identified. In the 2,412 heterozygous RH
premature stop codons, 652 were shared with DM and the remaining
1,760 were found in RH only (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Table 13).
Frameshift mutations were identified in 80 loci within RH, 49 homo-
zygous and 31 heterozygous, concentrated in seven genomic regions
(Fig. 3c and Supplementary Table 14). Finally, we identified presence/
absence variations for 275 genes; 246 were RH specific (absent in DM)
and 29wereDMspecific, with125 and 9 supported byRNA-Seq and/or
GeneOntology13annotationfor RHand DM,respectively(Supplemen-
tary Tables 15 and 16). Collectively, these data indicate that the
complement of homozygous deleterious alleles in DM may be respons-
ible for its reduced level of vigour (Fig. 3a).
The divergence between potato haplotypes is similar to that
reported between out-crossing maize accessions14 and, coupled with
our inability to successfully align 45% of the BAC sequences, intra-
and inter-genome diversity seem to be a significant feature of the
potato genome. A detailed comparison of the three haplotypes (DM
and the two haplotypes of RH) at two genomic regions (334 kb in
length) using the RH BAC sequence (Fig. 3d and Supplementary
Tables 17 and 18) revealed considerable sequence and structural vari-
ation. In one region (‘euchromatic’; Fig. 3d) we observed one instance
of copy number variation, five genes with premature stop codons, and
seven RH-specific genes. These observations indicate that the plas-
ticity of the potato genome is greater than revealed from the unas-
sembled RH NGS. Improved assembly algorithms, increased read
lengths, and de novo sequences of additional haplotypes will reveal
the full catalogue of genes critical to inbreeding depression.
Tuber biology
In developing DM and RH tubers, 15,235 genes were expressed in the
transition from stolons to tubers, with 1,217 transcripts exhibiting
.5-fold expression instolons versus fiveRHtuber tissues(youngtuber,
mature tuber, tuber peel, cortex and pith; Supplementary Table 19). Of
these, 333 transcripts were upregulated during the transition from
stolon to tuber, with the most highly upregulated transcripts encoding
storage proteins. Foremost among these were the genes encoding
proteinase inhibitors and patatin (15 genes), in which the phospholi-
pase A function has been largely replaced by a protein storage function
in the tuber15. In particular, a large family of 28 Kunitz protease inhib-
itor genes (KTIs) was identified with twice the number of genes in
potato compared to tomato. The KTI genes are distributed across the
genome with individual members exhibiting specific expression pat-
terns (Fig. 4a, b). KTIs are frequently induced after pest and pathogen
attack and act primarily as inhibitors of exogenous proteinases16; there-
fore the expansion of the KTI family may provide resistance to biotic
stress for the newly evolved vulnerable underground organ.
The stolon to tuber transition also coincides with strong upregula-
tion of genes associated with starch biosynthesis (Fig. 4c). We
observed several starch biosynthetic genes that were 3–8-fold more
highly expressed in tuber tissues of RH compared to DM (Fig. 4c).
Together this suggests a stronger shift from the relatively low sink
strength of the ATP-generating general carbon metabolism reactions
towards the plastidic starch synthesis pathway in tubers of RH,
thereby causing a flux of carbon into the amyloplast. This contrasts
with the cereal endosperm where carbon is transported into the amy-
loplast in the form of ADP-glucose via a specific transporter (brittle 1
protein17). Carbon transport into the amyloplasts of potato tubers is
primarily in the form of glucose-6-phosphate18, although recent evid-
ence indicates that glucose-1-phosphate is quantitatively important
under certain conditions19. The transport mechanism for glucose-1-
phosphate is unknown and the genome sequence contains six genes
for hexose-phosphate transporters with two highly and specifically
expressed in stolons and tubers. Furthermore, an additional 23 genes
encode proteins homologous to other carbohydrate derivative trans-
porters, such as triose phosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate, or UDP-
glucuronic acid transporters and two loci with homologues for the
brittle 1 protein. By contrast, in leaves, carbon-fixation-specific genes
such as plastidic aldolase, fructose-1,6-biphosphatase and distinct leaf
isoforms of starch synthase, starch branching enzyme, starch phos-
phorylase and ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase were upregulated. Of
particular interest is the difference in tuber expression of enzymes
involved in the hydrolytic and phosphorolytic starch degradation
pathways. Considerably greater levels of a-amylase (10–25-fold)
and b-amylase (5–10-fold) mRNAs were found in DM tubers com-
pared to RH, whereas a-1,4 glucan phosphorylase mRNA was equi-
valent in DM and RH tubers. These gene expression differences
between the breeding line RH and the more primitive DM are con-
sistent with the concept that increasing tuber yield may be partially
attained by selection for decreased activity of the hydrolytic starch
degradation pathway.
Recent studies using a potato genotype strictly dependent on short
days for tuber induction (S. tuberosum group Andigena) identified a
potato homologue (SP6A) of A. thaliana FLOWERING LOCUS T
(FT) as the long-distance tuberization inductive signal. SP6A is pro-
duced in the leaves, consistent with its role as the mobile signal (S.
Prat, personal communication). SP/FT is a multi-gene family
(Supplementary Text and Supplementary Fig. 7) and expression of
a second FT homologue, SP5G, in mature tubers suggests a possible
function in the control of tuber sprouting, a photoperiod-dependent
phenomenon20. Likewise, expression of a homologue of the A. thaliana
flowering time MADS box gene SOC1, acting downstream of FT21, is
restrictedtotubersprouts(SupplementaryFig.8).Expressionofathird
FT homologue, SP3D, does not correlate with tuberization induction
but instead with transition to flowering, which is regulated indepen-
dently of day length (S. Prat, personal communication). These data
indicate that neofunctionalization of the day-length-dependent
flowering control pathway has occurred in potato to control formation
and possibly sprouting of a novel storage organ, the tuber (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 9).
Disease resistance
Potato is susceptible to a wide range of pests and pathogens and the
identification of genes conferring disease resistance has been a major
focus of the research community. Most cloned disease resistance
genes in the Solanaceae encode nucleotide-binding site (NBS) and
leucine-rich-repeat (LRR) domains. The DM assembly contains 408
NBS-LRR-encoding genes, 57 Toll/interleukin-1 receptor/plant R
gene homology (TIR) domains and 351 non-TIR types (Supplemen-
tary Table 20), similar to the 402 resistance (R) gene candidates in
Populus22. Highly related homologues of the cloned potato late blight
resistance genes R1, RB, R2, R3a, Rpi-blb2 and Rpi-vnt1.1 were present
in the assembly. In RH, the chromosome 5 R1 cluster contains two
distinct haplotypes; one is collinear with the R1 region in DM
(Supplementary Fig. 10), yet neither the DM nor the RH R1 regions
are collinear with other potato R1 regions23,24. Comparison of the DM
potato R gene sequences with well-established gene models (func-
tional R genes) indicates that many NBS-LRR genes (39.4%) are pseu-
dogenes owing to indels, frameshift mutations, or premature stop

codons including the R1, R3a and Rpi-vnt1.1 clusters that contain
extensive chimaeras and exhibit evolutionary patterns of type I R
genes25. This high rate of pseudogenization parallels the rapid
evolution of effector genes observed in the potato late blight patho-
gen, Phytophthora infestans26. Coupled with abundant haplotype
diversity, tetraploid potato may therefore contain thousands of R-
gene analogues.
Conclusions and future directions
We sequenced a unique doubled-monoploid potato clone to overcome
the problems associated with genome assembly due to high levels of
heterozygosity and were able to generate a high-quality draft potato
genome sequence that provides new insights into eudicot genome
evolution. Using a combination of data from the vigorous, heterozyg-
ous diploid RH and relatively weak, doubled-monoploid DM, we could
directly address the form and extent of heterozygosity in potato and
provide the first view into the complexities that underlie inbreeding
depression. Combined with other recent studies, the potato genome
sequencemayelucidate the evolution oftuberization.Thisevolutionary
innovation evolved exclusively in the Solanum section Petota that
encompasses ,200 species distributed from the southwestern United
States to central Argentina and Chile. Neighbouring Solanum species,

including the Lycopersicon section, which comprises wild and culti-
vated tomatoes, did not acquire this trait. Both gene family expansion
and recruitment of existing genes for new pathways contributed to the
evolution of tuber development in potato.
Given the pivotal role of potato in world food production and
security, the potato genome provides a new resource for use in breed-
ing. Many traits of interest to plant breeders are quantitative in nature
and the genome sequence will simplify both their characterization and
deployment in cultivars. Whereas much genetic research is conducted
at the diploid level in potato, almost all potato cultivars are tetraploid
and most breeding is conducted in tetraploid material. Hence, the
development of experimental and computational methods for routine
and informative high-resolution genetic characterization of poly-
ploids remains an important goal for the realization of many of the
potential benefits of the potato genome sequence.
METHODS SUMMARY
DM1-3 516 R44 (DM) resulted from chromosome doubling of a monoploid
(1n51x 512) derived by anther culture of a heterozygous diploid (2n52x 524)
S.tuberosumgroupPhurejaclone(PI225669)27.RH89-039-16(RH)isadiploidclone
derived from a cross between a S. tuberosum ‘dihaploid’ (SUH2293) and a diploid
clone (BC1034) generated from a cross between two S. tuberosum3S. tuberosum
group Phureja hybrids28 (Supplementary Fig. 11). Sequence data from three plat-
forms, Sanger, Roche 454 Pyrosequencing, and Illumina Sequencing-by-Synthesis,
were used to assemble the DM genome using the SOAPdenovo assembly algorithm4.
The RH genotype was sequenced using shotgun sequencing of BACs and WGS in
which reads were mapped to the DM reference assembly. Superscaffolds were
anchored to the 12 linkage groups using a combination of in silico and genetic
mapping data. Repeat sequences were identified through sequence similarity at the
nucleotideandproteinlevel29.Geneswereannotatedusingacombinedapproach30on
the repeat masked genome with ab initio gene predictions, protein similarity and
transcripts to build optimal gene models. Illumina RNA-Seq reads were mapped to
the DM draft sequence using Tophat31 and expression levels from the representative
transcript were determined using Cufflinks32.

METHODS
DM whole-genome shotgun sequencing and assembly. Libraries were con-
structed from DM genomic DNA and sequenced on the Sanger, Illumina
Genome Analyser 2 (GA2) and Roche 454 platforms using standard protocols
(see Supplementary Text). A BAC library and three fosmid libraries were end
sequenced using the Sanger platform. For the Illumina GA2 platform, we generated
70.6Gb of 37–73 bp paired-end reads from 16 libraries with insert lengths of 200–
811 bp (Supplementary Tables 21 and 22). We also generated 18.7Gb of Illumina
mate-pair libraries (2, 5 and 10 kb insert size). Intotal, 7.2 Gb of 454 single-end data
were generated and applied for gap filling to improve the assembly, of which 4.7 Gb
(12,594,513 reads) were incorporated into the final assembly. For the 8 and 20kb
454 paired-end reads, representing 0.7 and 1.0Gb of raw data respectively, 90.7Mb
(511,254 reads) and 211 Mb (1,525,992 reads), respectively, were incorporated into
the final assembly.
We generated a high-quality potato genome using the short read assembly
software SOAPdenovo4 (Version 1014). We first assembled 69.4 Gb of GA2
paired-end short reads into contigs, which are sequence assemblies without gaps
composed of overlapping reads. To increase the assembly accuracy, only 78.3% of
the reads with high quality were considered. Then contigs were further linked into
scaffolds by paired-end relationships (,300 to ,550 bp insert size), mate-pair
reads (2 to approximately 10 kb), fosmid ends (,40 kb, 90,407 pairs of end
sequences) and BAC ends (,100 kb, 71,375 pairs of end sequences). We then
filled gaps with the entire short-read data generated using Illumina GA2 reads.
The primary contig N50 size (the contig length such that using equal or longer
contigs produces half of the bases of the assembled genome) was 697 bp and
increased to 1,318 kb after gap-filling (Supplementary Tables 23 and 24). When
only the paired-end relationships were used in the assembly process, the N50
scaffold size was 22.4 kb. Adding mate-pair reads with 2, 5 and 10 kb insert sizes,
the N50 scaffold size increased to 67, 173 and 389 kb, respectively. When inte-
grated with additional libraries of larger insert size, such as fosmid and BAC end
sequences, the N50 reached 1,318 kb. The final assembly size was 727 Mb, 93.87%
of which is non-gapped sequence. We further filled the gaps with 6.74 fold
coverage of 454 data, which increased the N50 contig size to 31,429 bp with
15.4% of the gaps filled.
The single-base accuracy of the assembly was estimated by the depth and
proportion of disconcordant reads. For the DM v3.0 assembly, 95.45% of 880
million usable reads could be mapped back to the assembled genome by SOAP
2.20 (ref. 34) using optimal parameters. The read depth was calculated for each
genomic location and peak depth for whole genome and the CDS regions are 100
and 105, respectively. Approximately 96% of the assembled sequences had more
than 20-fold coverage (Supplementary Fig. 1). The overall GC content of the
potato genome is about 34.8% with a positive correlation between GC content
and sequencing depth (data not shown). The DM potato should have few het-
erozygous sites and 93.04% of the sites can be supported by at least 90% reads,
suggesting high base quality and accuracy.
RH genome sequencing. Whole-genome sequencing of genotype RH was per-
formed on the Illumina GA2 platform using a variety of fragment sizes and reads
lengths resulting in a total of 144 Gb of raw data (Supplementary Table 25). These
data were filtered using a custom C program and assembled using SOAPdenovo
1.03 (ref. 4). Additionally, four 20-kb mate-pair libraries were sequenced on a
Roche 454 Titanium sequencer, amounting to 581 Mb of raw data (Supplemen-
tary Table 26). The resulting sequences were filtered for duplicates using custom
Python scripts.
The RH BACs were sequenced using a combination of Sanger and 454 sequen-
cing at various levels of coverage (Supplementary Tables 9–11). Consensus base
calling errors in the BAC sequences were corrected using custom Python and C
scripts using a similar approach to that described previously35 (Supplementary
Text). Sequence overlaps between BACs within the same physical tiling path were
identified using megablast from BLAST 2.2.21 (ref. 36) and merged with mega-
merger from the EMBOSS 6.1.0 package37. Using the same pipeline, several
kilobase-sized gaps were closed through alignment of a preliminary RH whole-
genome assembly. The resulting non-redundant contigs were scaffolded by map-
ping the RH whole-genome Illumina and 454 mated sequences against these
contigs using SOAPalign 2.20 (ref. 34) and subsequently processing these map-
ping results with a custom Python script. The scaffolds were then ordered into
superscaffolds based on the BAC order in the tiling paths of the FPC map. This
procedure removed 25 Mb of redundant sequence, reduced the number of
sequence fragments from 17,228 to 3,768, and increased the N50 sequence length
from 24 to 144 kb (Supplementary Tables 9 and 10).
Construction of the DM genetic map and anchoring of the genome. To anchor
and fully orientate physical contigs along the chromosome, a genetic map was
developed de novo using sequence-tagged-site (STS) markers comprising simple
sequence repeats (SSR), SNPs, and diversity array technology (DArT). SSR and
SNP markers were designed directly from assembled sequence scaffolds, whereas
polymorphic DArT marker sequences were searched against the scaffolds for
high-quality unique matches. A total of 4,836 STS markers including 2,174
DArTs, 2,304 SNPs and 358 SSRs were analysed on 180 progeny clones from a
backcross population ((DM3 DI) 3 DI) developed at CIP between DM and DI
(CIP no. 703825), a heterozygous diploid S. tuberosum group Stenotomum
(formerly S. stenotomum ssp. goniocalyx) landrace clone. The data from 2,603
polymorphic STS markers comprising 1,881 DArTs, 393 SNPs and 329 SSR
alleles were analysed using JoinMap 4 (ref. 38) and yielded the expected 12 potato
linkage groups. Supplementary Fig. 3 represents the mapping and anchoring of
the potato genome, using chromosome 7 as an example.
Anchoring the DM genome was accomplished using direct and indirect
approaches. The direct approach employed the ((DM3 DI) 3 DI) linkage map
whereby 2,037 of the 2,603 STS markers comprised of 1,402 DArTs, 376 SNPs and
259 SSRs could be uniquely anchored on the DM superscaffolds. This approach
anchored ,52% (394 Mb) of the assembly arranged into 334 superscaffolds
(Supplementary Table 27 and Supplementary Fig. 3).
RH is the male parent of the mapping population of the ultra-high-density
(UHD) linkage map28 used for construction and genetic anchoring of the physical
map using the RHPOTKEY BAC library39. The indirect mapping approach
exploited in silico anchoring using the RH genetic and physical map28,40, as well
as tomato genetic map data from SGN (http://solgenomics.net/). Amplified frag-
ment length polymorphism markers from the RH genetic map were linked to DM
sequence scaffolds via BLAST alignment36 of whole-genome-profiling sequence
tags41 obtained from anchored seed BACs in the RH physical map, or by direct
alignment of fully sequenced RH seed BACs to the DM sequence. The combined
marker alignments were processed into robust anchor points. The tomato
sequence markers from the genetic maps were aligned to the DM assembly using
SSAHA2 (ref. 42). Positions of ambiguously anchored superscaffolds were manu-
ally checked and corrected. This approach anchored an additional ,32% of the
assembly (229 Mb). In 294 cases, the two independent approaches provided direct
support for each other, anchoring the same scaffold to the same position on the
two maps.
Overall, the two strategies anchored 649 superscaffolds to approximate posi-
tions on the genetic map of potato covering a length of 623 Mb. The 623 Mb
(,86%) anchored genome includes ,90% of the 39,031 predicted genes. Of the
unanchored superscaffolds, 84 were found in the N90 (622 scaffolds greater than
0.25 Mb), constituting 17 Mb of the overall assembly or 2% of the assembled
genome. The longest anchored superscaffold is 7 Mb (from chromosome 1)
and the longest unanchored superscaffold is 2.5 Mb.
Identification of repetitive sequences. Transposable elements (TEs) in the
potato genome assembly were identified at the DNA and protein level.
RepeatMasker29 was applied using Repbase43 for TE identification at the DNA
level. At the protein level, RepeatProteinMask29,44 was used in a WuBlastX36
search against the TE protein database to further identify TEs. Overlapping
TEs belonging to the same repeat class were collated, and sequences were
removed if they overlapped .80% and belonged to different repeat classes.
Gene prediction. To predict genes, we performed ab initio predictions on the
repeat-masked genome and then integrated the results with spliced alignments of
proteins and transcripts to genome sequences using GLEAN30. The potato genome
was masked by identified repeat sequences longer than 500bp, except for mini-
ature inverted repeat transposable elements which are usually found near genes or
inside introns45. The software Augustus46 and Genscan47 was used for ab initio
predictions with parameters trained for A. thaliana. For similarity-based gene
prediction, we aligned the protein sequences of four sequenced plants (A. thaliana,
Carica papaya, V. vinifera and Oryza sativa) onto the potato genome using
TBLASTNwithanE-valuecut-offof13 1025,andthensimilargenomesequences
were aligned against the matching proteins using Genewise48 for accurately spliced
alignments. In EST-based predictions, EST sequences of 11 Solanum species were
aligned against the potato genome using BLAT (identity $0.95, coverage$0.90)
to generate spliced alignments. Alltheseresourcesandprediction approaches were
combined by GLEAN30 to build the consensus gene set. To finalize the gene set, we
aligned the RNA-Seq from 32 libraries, of which eight were sequenced with both
single- and paired-end reads, to the genome using Tophat31 and the alignments
were then used as input for Cufflinks32 using the default parameters. Gene, tran-
script and peptide sets were filtered to remove small genes, genes modelled across
sequencing gaps, TE-encoding genes, and other incorrect annotations. The final
gene set contains 39,031 genes with 56,218 protein-coding transcripts, of which
52,925 nonidentical proteins were retained for analysis.
Transcriptome sequencing. RNA was isolated from many tissues of DM and RH
that represent developmental, abiotic stress and biotic stress conditions (Sup-
plementary Table 4 and Supplementary Text). cDNA libraries were constructed
(Illumina) and sequenced on an Illumina GA2 in the single- and/or paired-end

mode. To represent the expression of each gene, we selected a representative
transcript from each gene model by selecting the longest CDS from each gene.
The aligned read data were generated by Tophat31 and the selected transcripts
used as input into Cufflinks32, a short-read transcript assembler that calculates the
fragments per kb per million mapped reads (FPKM) as expression values for each
transcript. Cufflinks was run with default settings, with a maximum intron length
of 15,000. FPKM values were reported and tabulated for each transcript (Sup-
plementary Table 19).
Comparative genome analyses. Paralogous and orthologous clusters were iden-
tified using OrthoMCL49 using the predicted proteomes of 11 plant species
(Supplementary Table 28). After removing 1,602 TE-related genes that were
not filtered in earlier annotation steps, asterid-specific and potato-lineage-
specific genes were identified using the initial OrthoMCL clustering followed
by BLAST searches (E-value cut-off of 1 3 1025) against assemblies of ESTs
available from the PlantGDB project (http://plantgdb.org; 153 nonasterid species
and 57 asterid species; Supplementary Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 29).
Analysis of protein domains was performed using the Pfam hmm models iden-
tified by InterProScan searches against InterPro (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro).
We compared the Pfam domains of the asterid-specific and potato-lineage-
specific sets with those that are shared with at least one other nonasterid genome
or transcriptome. A Fisher’s exact test was used to detect significant differences in
Pfam representation between protein sets.
After removing the self and multiple matches, the syntenic blocks ($5 genes
per block) were identified using MCscan9 and i-adhore 3.0 (ref. 50) based on the
aligned protein gene pairs (Supplementary Table 8). For the self-aligned results,
each aligned block represents the paralogous segments pair that arose from the
genome duplication whereas, for the inter-species alignment results, each aligned
block represents the orthologous pair derived from the shared ancestor. We
calculated the 4DTv (fourfold degenerate synonymous sites of the third codons)
for each gene pair from the aligned block and give a distribution for the 4DTv
value to estimate the speciation or WGD event that occurred in evolutionary
history.
Identification of disease resistance genes. Predicted open reading frames
(ORFs) from the annotation of S. tuberosum group Phureja assembly V3 were
screened using HMMER V.3 (http://hmmer.janelia.org/software) against the raw
hidden Markov model (HMM) corresponding to the Pfam NBS (NB-ARC)
family (PF00931). The HMM was downloaded from the Pfam home page
(http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/). The analysis using the raw HMM of the NBS domain
resulted in 351 candidates. From these, a high quality protein set (,1 3 10260)
was aligned and used to construct a potato-specific NBS HMM using the module
‘hmmbuild’. Using this new potato-specific model, we identified 500 NBS-
candidate proteins that were individually analysed. To detect TIR and LRR
domains, Pfam HMM searches were used. The raw TIR HMM (PF01582) and
LRR 1 HMM (PF00560) were downloaded and compared against the two sets of
NBS-encoding amino acid sequences using HMMER V3. Both TIR and LRR
domains were validated using NCBI conserved domains and multiple expectation
maximization for motif elicitation (MEME)51. In the case of LRRs, MEME was
also useful to detect the number of repeats of this particular domain in the protein.
As previously reported52, Pfam analysis could not identify the CC motif in the
N-terminal region. CC domains were thus analysed using the MARCOIL53 pro-
gram with a threshold probability of 90 (ref. 52) and double-checked using
paircoil2 (ref. 54) with a P-score cut-off of 0.025 (ref. 55). Selected genes
(61.5 kb) were searched using BLASTX against a reference R-gene set56 to find
a well-characterized homologue. The reference set was used to select and annotate
as pseudogenes those peptides that had large deletions, insertions, frameshift
mutations, or premature stop codons. DNA and protein comparisons were used.
Haplotype diversity analysis. RH reads generated by the Illumina GA2 were
mapped onto the DM genome assembly using SOAP2.20 (ref. 34) allowing at
most four mismatches and SNPs were called using SOAPsnp. Q20 was used to
filter the SNPs owing to sequencing errors. To exclude SNP calling errors caused
by incorrect alignments, we excluded adjacent SNPs separated by ,5 bp.
SOAPindel was used to detect the indels between DM and RH. Only indels
supported by more than three uniquely mapped reads were retained. Owing to
the heterozygosity of RH, the SNPs and indels were classified into heterozygous
and homozygous SNPs or indels.
On the basis of the annotated genes in the DM genome assembly, we extracted
the SNPs located at coding regions and stop codons. If a homozygous SNP in RH
within a coding region induced a premature stop codon, we defined the gene
harbouring this SNP as a homozygous premature stop gene in RH. If the SNP
inducing a premature stop codon was heterozygous, the gene harbouring this
SNP was considered a heterozygous premature stop codon gene in RH. In addi-
tion, both categories can be further divided into premature stop codons shared
with DM or not shared with DM. As a result, the numbers of premature stop
codons are 606 homozygous PS genes in RH, 1,760 heterozygous PS genes in RH
but not shared with DM, 288 PS in DM only, and 652 heterozygous premature
stop codons in RH and shared by DM.
To identify genes with frameshift mutations in RH, we identified all the genes
containing indels of which the length could not be divided by 3. We found 80
genes with frameshift mutations, of which 31 were heterozygous and 49 were
homozygous.
To identify DM-specific genes, we mapped all the RH Illumina GA2 reads to
the DM genome assembly. If the gene was not mapped to any RH read, it was
considered a DM-specific gene. We identified 35 DM-specific genes, 11 of which
are supported by similarity to entries in the KEGG database57. To identify RH-
specific genes, we assembled the RH Illumina GA2 reads that did not map to the
DM genome into RH-specific scaffolds. Then, these scaffolds were annotated
using the same strategy as for DM. To exclude contamination, we aligned the
CDS sequences against the protein set of bacteria with the E-value cut-off of
1 3 1025 using Blastx. CDS sequences with .90% identity and .90% coverage
were considered contaminants and were excluded. In addition, all DM RNA-seq
reads were mapped onto the CDS sequences, and CDS sequences with homolog-
ous reads were excluded because these genes may be due to incorrect assembly. In
total, we predicted 246 RH specific genes, 34 of which are supported by Gene
Ontology annotation17.
