Abstract 
The amount and type of organic matter in the sediments of lakes and oceans contribute to their paleoenviron- 
mental and paleoclimatological records. Only a small fraction of the initial aquatic organic matter survives de- 
struction and alteration during sinking and sedimentation. Selective degradation modifies the character of the 
surviving small fraction of organic matter which becomes incorporated in bottom sediments. Organic matter al- 
terations can continue to sub-bottom depths of hundreds of meters, corresponding to millions of years. Source and 
paleoenvironmental information nonetheless remains preserved in the molecular, elemental and isotopic compo- 
sitions of organic matter. C/N- and ~13C-values of total organic matter, in particular, appear to retain paleoenvi- 
ronmental information for multi-Myr time periods. 
1. Introduction 
Considerable difference exists between the 
concentration and character of biologically syn- 
thesized organic matter and that present in geo- 
logical settings. Many processes impact organic 
matter in the relatively short time between its 
synthesis and its permanent burial in sediments. 
Early diagenesis begins in the photic zone of lakes 
and oceans, continues during the sinking of or- 
ganic particles, and is intense in the bioturbated 
surface layer of sediments. Typically only a few 
percent of the initially biosynthesized organic 
matter consequently escapes remineralization 
and becomes buried in sediments (e.g., Suess, 
1980; Wakeham et al., 1980; Knauer and Mar- 
tin, 1981; Eadie et al., 1984; Emerson and 
Hedges, 1988). 
An important component of many paleocean- 
ographic and paleolimnologic investigations is to 
identify the sources of organic matter in sedi- 
ments deposited at different times in the past. A 
critical question in view of the known decreases 
that occur to the quantity of sedimenting organic 
matter is "How accurately does the type of or- 
ganic matter in sediments reflect the original 
sources?". Despite the extensive early diagenetic 
losses of organic matter in general and of some 
of its important biomarker compounds in partic- 
ular, two of the bulk identifiers of organic matter 
sources -- the C/N ratio and the 13C/~2C ratio 
appear to undergo little change. This paper re- 
views examples of lacustrine and marine C/N 
and ~ ~ 3C sedimentary records and considers their 
paleoenvironmental significance.

2. C/N and 613C identifiers of organic matter 
source 
C/N ratios have often been used to distinguish 
between algal and land-plant origins of sedimen- 
tary organic matter (e.g., Prahl et al., 1980; Pre- 
muzic et al., 1982; Ishiwatari and Uzaki, 1987; 
Jasper and Gagosian, 1990). Algae typically have 
atomic C/N ratios between 4 and 10, whereas 
vascular land plants have C/N ratios of >/20 
(Table 1 ). This distinction arises from the ab- 
sence of cellulose in algae and its abundance in 
vascular plants. Selective degradation of organic 
matter components during early diagenesis has 
the potential to modify C/N ratios of organic 
matter in sediments. The lowering of C/N ratios 
has been observed in soils (e.g., Sollins et al., 
1984), where it involves the microbial immobi- 
lization of nitrogenous material accompanied by 
the remineralization of carbon. The C/N source 
signal appears to be preserved, however, in sub- 
aqueous sediments. Vascular plant debris iso- 
lated from a coastal marine sediment in which 
the bulk C/N was 15 had C/N-values ranging 
between 30 and 40, which are characteristic of 
cellulosic plants (Ertel and Hedges, 1985 ). 
Carbon isotopic ratios are useful to distin- 
guish between marine and continental plant 
sources of sedimentary organic matter and to 
identify organic matter from different types of 
land plants. Most photosynthetic plants incor- 
porate carbon into organic matter using the Ca 
Calvin pathway which biochemically discrimi- 
nates against 13C to produce a ~13C shift of ~ 
-20%0 from the isotope ratio of the inorganic 
carbon source. Some plants use the Ca Hatch- 
Slack pathway, which creates a diffusional iso- 
tope shift of ~ - 7%0. Organic matter produced 
from atmospheric CO 2 ( t~ 13 C ~.~ _ 70/o0 ) by land 
plants using the Ca pathway consequently has an 
average ~ 3C-value of ~ - 270/o0 (PDB) and by 
those us;,ng the C4 pathway ~ 
-14%o (cf. 
O'Leary, 1988). Freshwater algae utilize dis- 
solved CO2, which is usually in isotopic equilib- 
rium with atmospheric CO2. As a consequence, 
the carbon isotopic composition of lake-derived 
organic matter is typically indistinguishable from 
that of organic matter from the surrounding wa- 
tershed (e.g., Nakai, 1972; Benson et al., 1991; 
Table 1 ). The source of inorganic carbon for ma- 
rine algae is dissolved bicarbonate, which has a 
13C_valu e of ~ 0%o. Marine organic matter con- 
sequently typically has ~3C-values between - 22 
and -20%o (Table 1 ). The ~ 7%o difference be- 
tween organic matter produced by C3 land plants 
and marine algae has successfully been used to 
trace the sources and distribution of organic 
matter in coastal ocean sediments (e.g., Hunt, 
1970; Newman et al., 1973; P.J. Gearing et al., 
1977). However, the isotopic source signal can 
become complicated in coastal areas which re- 
ceive contributions of organic matter from algae 
and both C3 and Ca vascular plants (e.g., Fry et 
al., 1977). In these areas, and also in lakes, ad- 
dition of C/N ratios to ~3C determinations al- 
lows better discrimination of organic matter 
sources. 
Four distinctive suites of C/N- and ~t3C-val- 
ues in plants are evident in Fig. 1. These comi- 
binations of elemental and carbon isotopic val- 
ues can be used to distinguish sources of organic 
matter in sediments and in settling particles. A 
particular benefit to using these bulk identifiers 
of organic matter origins is that they represent 
the whole mixture of organic matter compo- 
nents. In contrast, biomarker molecules typically 
are a very small fraction of the total mixture and

3. Alterations of organic matter during sinking 
Sediment traps have been employed in lakes 
and oceans to study changes in compositions of 
organic matter during sinking to bottom sedi- 
ments. These studies have shown that substan- 
tial degradation of both total organic matter and 
of specific components ,occurs during sinking. 
Results from lakes emphasize how rapidly change 
can occur during sinking relatively short dis- 
tances; only 6% of the initial algal organic matter 
survives to reach Lake Michigan (North Amer- 
ica) bottom sediments in 100 m of water (Eadie 
et al., 1984). 
The molecular source character of organic 
matter can change during sinking and incorpo- 
ration into sediments. Fluxes of marine algal 
biomarkers at water depths of 5000 m, for in-

stance, are less than 1% of their photic zone fluxes 
(Wakeham and Lee, 1989). In Lake Michigan, 
the proportions of algal fatty acids and alcohols 
similarly decrease at progressively deeper sedi- 
ment trap depths (Meyers et al., 1984a). Fatty 
acid decomposition rates calculated from sedi- 
ment trap compositions show that H-C16 de- 
grades ~ 10 times faster than n-C30 (Meyers and 
Eadie, 1993). Preferential degradation of algal 
biomarkers continues in bottom sediments. Ka- 
wamura et al. ( 1987 ) found that distributions of 
n-alkanes in surficial sediments from Lake Ha- 
runa, Japan, were depleted in n-El7 relative to 
the hydrocarbon contents of sediment trap ma- 
terial in this lake. As a consequence of the selec- 
tive degradation of algal biomarker molecules, 
land-plant lipids dominate the biomarker con- 
tents of modem sediment from Lake Vechten in 
The Netherlands, although carbon budgets indi- 
cate that land contributions comprise a small part 
of the original input to this lake system (Goos- 
sens et al., 1989 ). 
Comparison of the organic matter C/N ratios 
and ~13C-values of plankton, sediment trap con- 
tents and surficial sediment in Lake Michigan 
suggests that these bulk parameters retain source 
information despite large decreases in the total 
amount of organic matter during sinking (Fig. 
2). Organic carbon concentrations diminish by 
a factor of 10 between plankton and the lake bot- 
tom, yet little difference is evident between the 
initial and final C/N or carbon isotopic ratios. 
Considerable variation is evident, however, in 
the C/N-values of the sinking organic matter. 
These changes in organic matter elemental com- 
position agree with observed changes in bio- 
marker compositions that show selective losses 
of algal components in the upper water column 
and apparent lateral input of algal organic mat- 
ter at deeper depths (Meyers and Eadie, 1993 ). 
These changes apparently reflect different dia- 
genetic processes at different depths. The iso- 
topic compositions are less sensitive to selective 
diagenesis, principally because the isotopic sig- 
natures of algal and land-plant organic matter are 
typically the same in lakes (Table 1; Fig. 1 ).

netic change during the relatively short time that

is needed to sink to the bottom of lakes and 
oceans suggests that many more changes can oc- 
cur during the much longer times that organic 
matter resides in sediments. A variety of differ- 
ent carbohydrates, amino compounds, lipids and 
derived materials constitute sedimentary or- 
ganic matter. Some of these organic substances 
are more reactive than others, providing the op- 
portunity for selective diagenesis to modify the 
source character of organic matter. The prefer- 
ential degradation of algal biomarkers in sedi- 
ment traps and lakes (e.g., Meyers et al., 1984a; 
Kawamura et al., 1987; Goossens et al., 1989; 
Wakeham and Lee, 1989) is an apt example of 
diagenetic source character modification. These 
diagenetic modifications of specific components 
of organic matter have raised important ques- 
tions about the reliability of bulk organic matter 
parameters as source indicators. 
4. Alteration and preservation of organic matter 
source records in lake sediments 
Sediment trap studies show that the propor- 
tions of algal and land-derived organic matter can

293 
be identified by C/N and carbon isotopic ratios. 
A survey of lake studies reveals that bulk source 
character is preserved over the longer periods of 
time during which organic matter resides in sed- 
iments, even though organic matter may con- 
tinue to be degraded. 
4.1. Sedimentary organic matter record in 
Mangrove Lake (Bermuda) 
Mangrove Lake is a small saline lake located 
close to the Bermuda shoreline. No permanent 
streams flow into the lake; its principal source of 
water is from seawater seepage through the 
permeable limestone between it and the sea. Al- 
gal production is the main source of organic mat- 
ter to the present-day lake, although mangroves 
surround it. The sedimentary sequence of Man- 
grove Lake consists of peat overlain by sapropels 
and records a progression from a late Pleistocene 
freshwater bog to a freshwater lake and finally to 
a saline lake as sealevel rose in the Holocene (Fig. 
3 ). The transition from freshwater to salt-water 
conditions occurred ~ 4 kyr ago (Hatcher et al., 
1982 ). The sediments are rich in organic matter 
throughout the sequence, containing between 
18% and 40% organic carbon. 
Organic C/N-values approximate the changes 
in organic matter sources to the sediments of

Mangrove Lake. The values are between 11 and 
17 in the marine sapropel, between 22 and 28 in 
the freshwater sapropel, and between 22 and 46 
in the peat layer (Fig. 3 ). The C/N ratios indi- 
cate that the organic matter in the sapropels is a 
mix of vascular plant debris and algal plus bac- 
terial remains which changes in the three types 
of sediment. Diagenetic alterations have not ob- 
literated the general information about organic 
matter sources in the multi-kyr record of these 
sediments. 
Comparison of the 513C ratios of total organic 
carbon and of the humin fraction of sediment or- 
ganic matter shows a downcore convergence in 
isotopic values (Fig. 3 ). This shift apparently is 
caused at least partly by selective loss of the iso- 
topically heavy carbohydrate fraction of total or- 
ganic matter (Spiker and Hatcher, 1984), but 
changes in the proportion of land-derived and 
marine-derived organic matter may also contrib- 
ute. The possible diagenetic shift in the carbon 
isotope values is ~ - 2%o over the multi-kyr age 
of these sediments. This value is essentially iden- 
tical to the isotopic shift estimated by Hayes et 
al. (1989) in organic matter from the 91-Myr- 
old Greenhorn Formation, Kansas, U.S.A. De- 
spite the possibility of a diagenetic overprint on 
the isotopic compositions, the overall change in 
humin 813C-values from -26°o in the peat layer 
to - 18%o at the sediment surface clearly reflects 
a change from land plants to marine algae as the 
major source of organic matter in Mangrove 
Lake. 
4.2. Sedimentary organic matter record in Lake 
Baikal (Siberia, Russia) 
Lake Baikal in southeastern Siberia is re- 
nowned for its great depth and ancient geological 
age. A sediment core from the northern basin 
provides a record of the last ~ 9 kyr, which in- 
cludes retreat of montane glaciers and establish- 
ment of forests in the catchment area (Qiu et al., 
1993). The sediment layers reflect this se- 
quence, and the C/N ratios and 513C-values show 
changes in organic matter sources that accom- 
pany 
this 
paleoenvironmental 
succession 
(Fig. 4).

Fig. 4. Organic carbon concentrations, atomic C/N ratios and 
carbon isotopic signatures of sediments from Lake Baikal, 
Siberia. From Qiu et al. (1993). 
C/N-values in the postglacial blue clay muds 
deposited before 6.5 k-yr ago vary between 15 and 
50, and indicate substantial contributions of 
vascular land-plant material (Fig. 4). They vary 
little from ~ 15 in the diatom ooze that has ac- 
cumulated since 6.5 kyr ago. The change in sed- 
iment type from one dominated by glacial flour 
to one made up of algal material indicates that 
lake productivity increased at ~ 6.5 kyr ago, and 
this conclusion is strengthened by an increase in 
sediment organic carbon concentrations (Fig. 4). 
The drop in more recent C/N ratios indicates 
that algal organic matter became a larger com- 
ponent of sediment organic matter at this 
transition. 
Organic carbon 5~3C-values change from 
-23%o in sediments laid clown before 6.5 kyr ago 
to ~ -28 since that time. The increase in lake 
productivity is associated with the advent of a 
forested watershed (Qiu et al., 1993), and or- 
ganic matter derived from these plants probably 
has accumulated in the lake sediments since this 
time. The isotopic signatures of C3 land plants 
cannot be distinguished from those of freshwater 
algae, unlike the C/N ratios (Table 1 ). The 
change in isotope ratios probably indicates a 
change in watershed vegetation from C4 tundra 
grasses to C 3 woody plants (Fig. 1 ). Both the el- 
emental and isotopic ratios show that the sedi- 
ment organic matter is a mixture of lake and land 
material, and they preserve a record of change in 
the relative proportions of algal and land-de- 
rived organic matter from several sources in this 
lake. 
4.3. Sedimentary organic matter record in Lake 
Bosumtwi (Ghana) 
Lake Bosumtwi occupies a meteorite impact 
crater in a low-lying region of Ghana and is con- 
sequently a relatively shallow (78 m max.), 
broad (8-km diameter) lake having no outflow 
and a rather small watershed. The lake is per- 
manently anoxic, and climate variations have 
caused the lake level to both rise and fall in the 
past (Talbot and Johannessen, 1992). Tropical 
forests cover the land around the lake today; sa- 
vannas were dominant during drier climates of 
the past. A 17-m sediment core from the deepest 
part of the lake provides a history of organic 
matter accumulation over the past 27.4 kyr. The 
core is divided into four major layers (Fig. 5), 
which indicate that important changes have oc- 
curred in the lake ecosystem over this time. 
Organic matter C/N ratios fluctuate markedly 
over the sedimentary history of Lake Bosumtwi 
(Fig. 5). The existence of values ranging be- 
tween 15 and 35 in closely spaced sediment in- 
tervals, combined with no downcore trend to

higher or lower values, suggests that selective 
diagenesis has not had any major effect on or- 
ganic matter C/N ratios in sediments as old as 
27.4 kyr in this lake. The variations occur prin- 
cipally in laminated intervals and record changes 
in the delivery of land-derived organic matter to 
the lake sediments as climate conditions changed. 
Least variation is found in the sapropel layer, 
which represents a relatively stable period of high 
lake level, forested watershed and wetter climate 
(Talbot and Johannessen, 1992 ). The transition 
to this more stable interval occurs in the early 
Holocene (Fig. 5). 
Organic carbon t~13C-values record changes in 
the types of land vegetation around Lake Bos- 
umtwi. The heavier values in the mixed clastic/ 
carbonate laminated sediments (Fig. 5) reflect 
contributions from C4 plants that lived during the 
drier conditions that existed near the end of the 
last glacial maximum 25 to 10 kyr ago (Talbot 
and Johannessen, 1992). Values ~ - 25%0 in the 
deep muds and in the upper sediment layers in- 
dicate delivery of organic matter from C3 land 
plants that were present during wetter, forested 
parts of the lake history. Talbot and Johannessen 
( 1992 ) consider possible diagenetic alteration of 
the carbon isotope record and conclude from 
several lines of evidence that it is minimal. The 
5 t3C record of this lake is evidently dominated 
by changes in sources of organic matter. 
4.4. Sedimentary organic matter record in Lake 
Biwa (Japan) 
Sediments from Lake Biwa, Japan, provide a 
unique opportunity to investigate changes in or- 
ganic matter sources and diagenesis over a long 
period of time. Five lithologic units were re- 
covered by drilling in 1982/1983, totaling 911 m 
of sediments which overlie Paleozoic-Mesozoic 
basement rocks (Takemura, 1990). The oldest 
of these units is Pliocene in age. The downward 
sequence consists of: (1) the T Bed, a 250-m- 
thick unit composed of lacustrine deep-water 
clays; (2) the S Bed, a 332-m-thick unit contain- 
ing alternations of shallow-water sands and silts; 
(3) the R Bed, a 150-m-thick unit made up of 
clay, sand and gravel subunits representing fluc- 
tuating deep and shallow depositional condi- 
tions; (4) the Q Bed, a 72-m-thick unit com- 
posed of layers of silt, sand and gravel laid down 
under shallow lacustrine or fluvial conditions; 
and (5) the P Bed, a 107-m-thick unit contain- 
ing poorly sorted pebbles and gravels represent- 
ing a fluviodeltaic environment. The basal age of 
the T Bed is estimated 1:o be 0.43 Myr (Meyers 
et al., 1993 ), and fission-track dating gives an age 
of 2.4 Myr at 681 m in the R Bed (Takemura, 
1990). The different sediment types record stages 
in the development of the lake which may have 
associated changes in sources of organic matter. 
Accumulation of organic matter was fairly 
uniform over the entire history of the upper clay 
layer (T Bed); organic carbon concentrations are 
generally between 0.5% and 1%, and C/N ratios 
remain about l0 (Fig. 6). In the sand and silt 
layer (S Bed), organic carbon values are more 
variable, but on average slightly lower. C/N ra- 
tios also vary considerable; their higher values 
indicate episodes of greater delivery of land-plant 
matter. The change in C/N pattern at the 250-m 
core depth records a shift from aquatic plant 
dominance in younger sediments to greater in- 
put of land-plant contributions in organic matter 
deposited previous to 0.43 Myr ago. This inter- 
pretation is consistent with a change in sediment 
types from fine-grained deep-water sediment to 
shallow-water sands and gravels at the 250-m 
depth. C/N-values return to values like those in

the upper clays in the deep-water clay-sand al- 
ternations of the R Bed, and organic carbon con- 
centrations are similar to those in the base of the 
upper clay layer (Fig. 6). C/N ratios appear to 
preserve the differences between land-plant and 
algal sources of organic matter even in these 2.4- 
Myr-old sediments. 
Organic carbon ~3C-values change from 
- 25.5%0 in near-surface sediments to ~ - 28%0 
at 250-m depth. A progressive change in organic 
matter source or diagenesis is not evident from 
C/N ratios, which remain virtually unchanged 
(Fig. 6). Nakai (1972) has postulated that the 
local climate has become progressively warmer 
over the past 0.4 Myr, warming the surface waters 
of the lake and decreasing the kinetic isotopic 
fractionation by algae, but the pollen record does 
not indicate a progressive warming of the region. 
Progressively greater rates of algal productivity 
would also decrease their isotopic fractionation 
by limiting the availability of CO2 dissolved in 
the lake waters. The trend to lower organic car- 
bon concentrations in older sediments suggests 
that there has in fact been a change in the rate of 
algal production over the 4.3-Myr history of the 
T Bed. A similar pattern of decreasing organic 
carbon burial and accompanying change in iso- 
topic fractionation with sediment depth has been 
reported for Lake Ontario, North America 
(Schelske and Hodell, 1991 ), but this change in 
algal productivity occurred over the past century 
as a result of clear-cutting of the Ontario wa- 
tershed. A different explanation is needed for the 
vastly different time-scale of the Lake Biwa 
change, and this explanation remains to be found. 
Carbon isotope ratios are highly variable in the 
alternating sediment types below the upper clay 
(Fig. 6 ). Like the C/N ratios, this variability may 
result from changes in the proportions of lake- 
and land-derived organic matter if there were 
changes in the proportions of C3 and Ca plants, 
as well. The range of variation is much smaller, 
however, than those in Lake Baikal and Lake 
Bosumtwi (Figs. 4 and 5 ), where changes in wa- 
tershed organic matter sources from C3 to Ca 
plant dominance are recorded, thereby ruling out 
this effect. Because the heaviest isotope values 
generally coincide with the lowest C/N ratios 
(Fig. 6), algal productivity fluctuations are the 
most likely cause. The Lake Biwa isotope record 
appears to preserve intriguing and tantalizing 
paleolimnological information which awaits sat- 
isfactory interpretation. 
5. Organic matter source records in marine 
sediments 
The organic matter in marine sediments typi- 
cally accumulates at slower rates and over longer 
periods of time than in lake sediments. It conse- 
quently has the potential to record longer paleo- 
ceanographic histories and to reveal the effects 
of slow-acting diagenetic alterations that are not 
evident in lake sediments. Marine algae are iso- 
topically heavier than C3 land plants (Table 1; 
Fig. 1 ), so organic carbon isotopic compositions 
can be used to distinguish algal and land-plant 
contributions in marine sediments. 
5. i. Record of source changes at DSDP Site 619 
(northern Gulf of Mexico) 
Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Site 619 is 
located at 2259-m water depth in the Pygmy 
Basin on the continental shelf of the northern 
Gulf of Mexico. This oxic basin is a trap for con- 
tinental and coastal marine sediments. The 209- 
m core of sediment from this site represents the 
last ~ 0.1 Myr of deposition and includes the 
most recent glacial-interglacial transition. 
Concentrations of total organic carbon gener- 
ally remain between 0.5% and 1.0%, but a signif- 
icant enhancement is present in sediments de- 
posited between 25 and 8 kyr ago (Fig. 7). This 
maximum zone roughly corresponds to maxi- 
mum C/N ratios and minimum ~13C-values 
(Fig. 7). These patterns have been interpreted 
by Jasper and Gagosian (1990) to represent a 
record of changes in the proportional contribu- 
tions of land-derived and algal organic matter. 
During the last glacial sealevel lowstand (25 to 
10 kyr ago), continental organic matter from the 
Mississippi River in North America dominated 
accumulation at this location. Sediments depos- 
ited before 90 and after I 0 kyr ago contain larger

proportions of marine organic matter. 
The C/N and carbon isotopic ratios appear to 
record the organic matter source changes relia- 
bly, yet in situ degradation of sedimentary or- 
ganic matter is evident from biomarker analyses 
(Jasper and Gagosian, 1993). Both sulfate-re- 
ducing and methanogenic bacteria are active in 
these sediments. Pore water sulfate diminishes 
with depth, and this trend is presumably accom- 
panied by organic carbon oxidation. Methane 
with t~13C-values between - 95%0 and - 72%0 is 
present in sediments at depths of 76-178 m and 
signifies active microbial populations. Jasper and 
Gagosian (1990) noted that concentrations of 
organic carbon seem to diminish following a first- 
order decay. Deeper concentrations are indeed 
less than those in the upper sediments (Fig. 7), 
but much of this pattern reflects addition of con- 
tinental organic matter during the last glacial 
lowstand to a low background of marine organic 
matter and probably not postdepositional deg- 
radation. The indirect evidence of microbial ac- 
tivity strongly indicates that organic matter is 
being destroyed deep in the sediments, but prob- 
ably not at high rates. Fluctuations in organic 
carbon concentrations appear to record varia- 
tions in initial deposition rather than variations 
in diagenetic destruction of organic matter. The 
important conclusion is that organic matter 
source signatures are preserved in the elemental 
and isotopic compositions of Site 619 sediments 
despite evidence of continued, postdepositional 
microbial activity. 
5.2. Record of fluctuations in marine 
productivity at DSDP Site 532 (Walvis Ridge, 
South Atlantic) 
Sediments in DSDP Site 532 on the continen- 
tal terrace of the Walvis Ridge, southwest Afri- 
can margin, record the history of enhanced ma- 
rine productivity associated with the Benguela 
Current upwelling system. Upwelling was initi- 
ated ~ 10 Myr ago (Siesser, 1980) and has grad- 
ually increased since that time. Site 532 sedi- 
ments are diatom-rich calcareous oozes, and they 
typically contain light-dark variations in color 
and carbonate concentrations which are be- 
lieved to represent Milankovitch-type fluctua- 
tions in marine productivity (Diester-Haass et 
al., 1992). 
Organic carbon concentrations in sediments 
from near the Plio-Pleistocene boundary are 
~ 4% in dark-colored intervals in which carbon- 
ate concentrations are depressed and ~ 2% in

light-colored, carbonate-rich intervals (Fig. 8). 
The inverse relationship between organic and in- 
organic carbon reflects varying dissolution of the 
CaCO3 by dissolved CO2 generated by oxidation 
of organic carbon (Diester-Haass et al., 1992). 
As noted also in the sediments of DSDP Site 619, 
the presence of abundant sub-bottom methane 
and CO2 implies that methanogenic bacteria are 
actively degrading organic matter throughout the 
Site 532 sediments (Meyers and Brassell, 1985 ). 
Variations in organic C/N- and t~13C-values do 
not follow the organic carbon pattern, yet they 
seem to be related (Fig. 8 ). The isotopic values 
fall nicely within the range of marine algae, but 
the C/N ratios are much higher than expected 
for algal organic matter (Table 1 ). Neither of 
these potential source identifiers appears to be 
affected by the postulated variations in oxida- 
tion of organic matter reflected in the light-dark 
cycles (Fig. 8 ) or by the general degradation of 
organic matter indicated by biogenic gases. 
The elevated C/N ratios would normally in- 
dicate that an important proportion of land- 
plant-derived organic matter is contained in these 
sediments, but several types of evidence contra- 
dict this conclusion: ( 1 ) the sediments are bio- 
genic oozes with little clastic input; (2) the 
coastal Namib Desert is sparsely vegetated and 
can provide little organic matter; (3) the iso- 
topic values indicate a marine algal source of or- 
ganic matter; and (4) Rock-Eval ® analyses of the 
sedimentary organic matter confirm a predomi- 
nantly marine origin (Meyers et al., 1984b). The 
elevated C/N ratios might accompany high rates 
of marine productivity, possibly under condi- 
tions of limited nitrogen availability (Meyers, 
1992 ). The organic matter produced under such 
conditions would be lipid-rich and nitrogen-poor, 
thereby having higher than expected C/N ratios. 
High productivity typically diminishes isotopic 
discrimination in algae (cf. Schelske and Hodell, 
1991 ) and leads to heavier 513C-values, which 
are in fact found associated with elevated C/N 
ratios in the Plio-Pleistocene Site 532 sediments 
(Fig. 8 ). The similarities between the C/N and 
~ 3C profiles may record productivity variations 
which are independent of the light-dark cycles 
in these upwelling sediments. 
5.3. Organic matter record of high-latitude 
marine productivity at ODP Site 689 (Maude 
Rise, South Atlantic) 
Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 689 is lo- 
cated in 2083 m of water on the crest of the 
Maude Rise ~ 500 km north of Antarctica. Sed- 
iments are biogenic oozes and typically contain 
>~ 90% CaCO3. They accumulated slowly; the pa- 
leoceanographic record of nearly all of the Ter- 
tiary and Quaternary (65 Myr) is represented by 
250 m of sediment. Accumulation rates have, 
however, accelerated since the Miocene-Pli- 
ocene boundary. Sediments from the entire Mio- 
cene (20 Myr) are equal in thickness to sedi- 
ments from the Pliocene (3 Myr). 
Organic 
carbon 
concentrations are 
low 
(~0.1%) throughout the 250-m sediment re- 
cord at Site 689 (Fig. 9 ), reflecting low sedimen- 
tation rates and low marine productivity (Macko 
and Pereira, 1990). The higher sedimentation 
rates evident from the thickness of the Pliocene 
and Pleistocene units indicate that organic mat- 
ter mass accumulation rates must have increased 
since the Miocene. C/N ratios are generally low, 
and the frequent spikes in C/N ratios are enig- 
matic (Macko and Pereira, 1990). They may re- 
cord variations in diagenetic alterations of algal 
organic matter (C/N~ 5) in which CO2 would

diffuse away whereas ammonium nitrogen would 
remain trapped in the sediments (MiJUer, 1977 ). 
Organic carbon 5' 3C-values are relatively light 
for marine plankton (Table 1 ), yet they are un- 
likely to represent delivery of land-derived or- 
ganic matter from ice-covered Antarctica. Rau et 
al. (1989) have shown that cold polar seawater 
can accommodate substantially more dissolved 
CO2 than temperate or tropical waters, thereby 
permitting greater isotopic discrimination by al- 
gae. The 513C-values of ~ -27%o suggest that 
cool conditions prevailed over Site 619 through 
most of the Tertiary even though a permanent 
ice sheet did not develop on Antarctica until ~ 35 
Myr ago (Kennett, 1977). Variability increases 
in ~3C-values in sediments deposited since the 
Middle Miocene and values in general become 
heavier (Fig. 9 ). These changes in isotopic com- 
position but not in C/N ratios suggest that ma- 
rine productivity rates increased, although not 
smoothly, towards present conditions. The Site 
689 sediments evidently preserve a record of or- 
ganic matter production for the past 60 Myr, even 
though substantial recycling of the organic mat- 
ter has occurred before and after deposition. 
5.4. Record of marine organic matter 
accumulation at ODP Site 805 (Ontong Java 
Plateau, north Pacific) 
ODP Site 805 is located under the North Pa- 
cific Ocean equatorial upwelling zone in 3188-m 
water depth on the Ontong Java Plateau. Sedi- 
ments are a nannofossil ooze (~ 90% CaCO3) 
throughout the Neogene-Quaternary sections 
recovered at this location. 
Concentrations of organic carbon are very low 
( < 0.05%) in sediments deposited between 25 
and 6 Myr ago and increase to ~ 0.1% since 5 
Myr ago (Fig. 10). Calculated mass accumula- 
tion rates imply that greater delivery of organic 
matter, not simply improved preservation at the 
seafloor, is responsible for the higher concentra- 
tions (Stax and Stein, 1993). The enhanced de- 
livery may arise from higher rates of marine or- 
ganic matter production, from addition of land- 
derived organic matter, or from a general in- 
crease in total sediment accumulation. C/N ra-

tios remain between 5 and 10 throughout the core 
and indicate a predominantly marine origin for 
the sedimentary organic matter, eliminating ma- 
jor additions of continental material as a possi- 
ble explanation. Moreover, the dominance of 
marine material agrees with the sediment char- 
acter. Estimated paleoproductivities in the up- 
per and lower parts of the cored sediment record 
are the same ( ~ 38 g m -2 yr-l C) and are some- 
what lower than an estimate of modern produc- 
tivity (45 g m -2 yr-i C) based on the concentra- 
tion of organic carbon in surficial sediments 
(Stax and Stein, 1993). A change in productiv- 
ity is consequently not evident from the organic 
carbon data. The enhanced accumulation of or- 
ganic carbon peaking at 5 Myr ago may arise from 
increased accumulation of the biogenic sedi- 
ments and may therefore be indirect evidence of 
increased productivity. Organic matter in the 
Site-805 sediments does not in itself preserve a 
history of equatorial upwelling, even though it 
preserves a marine source character. Probable 
variations in the degradation of marine organic 
matter during its sinking to the depth of this site

appears to introduce uncertainties into estimates 
of surface productivity rates. The sediment re- 
cord at this location shows that quantitative use 
of organic matter must be done cautiously, inas- 
much as preservation can be variable. 
5.5. Record of increased continental sediment 
input to DSDP Site 443 (north Philippine Sea) 
DSDP Site 443 is located in the Shikoku Basin 
south of Japan. Sediments from this site are 
hemipelagic, and their accumulation rate has in- 
creased since 2 Myr ago (Fig. 11 ). Organic car- 
bon concentrations are generally ~ 0.1%, but in- 
crease to ~0.3-0.4% in sediments deposited 
during the past 1 Myr. C/N ratios change from 
~ 5 to ~ 10 as the organic carbon concentrations 
increase (Fig. 11 ). 
The changes in organic carbon concentration 
and in C/N ratios were interpreted by Waples 
and Sloan (1980) as evidence of continuing dia- 
genesis of organic matter over multi-Myr time 
periods. They postulated that nitrogen-contain- 
ing organic compounds were protected by asso- 
ciation with mineral particles whereas carbon- 
rich organic matter components gradually were 
decomposed. Subsequent inferential evidence of 
microbial activity to depths of several hundreds 
of meters in marine sediments supports this hy-

pothesis (e.g., Meyers and Brassell, 1985; Jasper 
and Gagosian, 1990, 1993). 
An alternate possibility, however, seems more 
plausible given the lack of evidence of continued 
loss of marine organic carbon from Sites 689 and 
805 in sediments that are older than those at Site 
443. It is probable that the increases in sedimen- 
tation rate, organic carbon concentration, and 
C/N ratios in sediments deposited since ~ 1 Myr 
ago record enhanced contribution of continental 
sediments and their associated organic matter. A 
very likely source of these sediments is the Huang 
Ho, which drains much of China north of the 
Himalaya. Since the onset of northern hemi- 
sphere glaciation during the Pliocene, sediment 
loads of rivers have been delivered directly to the 
deep basins of the oceans during glacial sealevel 
lowstands, thereby increasing hemipelagic sedi- 
mentation rates. The Huang Ho would empty 
into the western Pacific Ocean very near the Shi- 
koku Basin during lowstands. Cellulose-rich 
continental organic matter is typically less de- 
gradable than algal organic matter, and it has a 
higher C/N ratio (Table 1 ). The changes in or- 
ganic matter amount and type at Site 443 are 
probably similar in origin to those at Site 619 in 
the Pygmy Basin, where glacial-age sediments are 
enriched by continental organic matter. Conse- 
quently, the C/N profile may preserve a record 
of source change and not a diagenetic effect. 
5. Summary and conclusions 
An overview of changes in the amounts and 
compositions of organic matter collected in sed- 
iment traps and present in sediments of lakes and 
oceans allows some general conclusions about the 
preservation of source indicators: 
(1) Only a small fraction of the original or- 
ganic matter produced in the photic zone sur- 
vives destruction and alteration during sinking 
and sedimentation in lakes and oceans. 
(2) Biomarker molecules indicative of algal 
organic matter sources are preferentially de- 
stroyed, thereby biasing the molecular source 
character of sedimentary organic matter towards 
land plants.

(3) The C/N and carbon isotope composi- 
ti0n  of 0rganic mattar ft0m  everal broad classes 
of plants can be used in tandem to distinguish 
between organic matter from freshwater algae, 
marine algae, continental C3 plants and conti- 
nental C4 plants. 
(4) The C/N- and ~13C-values of total organic 
matter appear to retain source signatures which, 
despite some possible early diagenetic modifica- 
tions, remain intact for million-year time periods. 
(5) The possible consequences of diagenesis 
must always be judiciously considered when 
making organic matter source estimates. Sedi- 
mentary matrices provide important informa- 
tion about the reasonableness of source esti- 
mates based on organic constituents.
