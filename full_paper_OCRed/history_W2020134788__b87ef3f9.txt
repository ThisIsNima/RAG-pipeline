ABSTRACT
MCScan is an algorithm able to scan multiple
genomes
or
subgenomes
in
order
to
identify
putative homologous chromosomal regions, and
align these regions using genes as anchors. The
MCScanX toolkit implements an adjusted MCScan
algorithm for detection of synteny and collinearity
that extends the original software by incorporating
14
utility
programs
for
visualization
of
results
and additional downstream analyses. Applications
of MCScanX to several sequenced plant genomes
and
gene
families
are
shown
as
examples.
MCScanX
can
be
used
to
effectively
analyze
chromosome structural changes, and reveal the
history of gene family expansions that might con-
tribute to the adaptation of lineages and taxa.
An integrated view of various modes of gene dupli-
cation can supplement the traditional gene tree
analysis in specific families. The source code and
documentation of MCScanX are freely available at
http://chibba.pgml.uga.edu/mcscan2/.
INTRODUCTION
Comparative
genomic
studies
often
rely
on
the
accurate identiﬁcation of homology (genes that share
a
common
evolutionary
origin)
within
or
across
genomes. Homologous genes are further classiﬁed as
either orthologous, if they were separated by a speciation
event, or paralogous, if they were separated by a gene
duplication
event.
Recently,
comparisons
between
related eukaryotic genomes reveal various degrees to
which
homologous
genes
remain
on
corresponding
chromosomes (synteny) and in conserved orders (collin-
earity) during evolution (1). Over evolutionary time,
genomes have been shaped and dynamically restructured
by several forces such as whole-genome duplication
(WGD), segmental duplication, inversions and transloca-
tions (2–5). These forces have acted in various combin-
ations and to differing degrees to result in taxonomic
groups with different modes of genome structure modiﬁ-
cation and gene family expansion. For example, angio-
sperm (ﬂowering plants) genomes appear more volatile
than mammalian genomes (1). Angiosperm genomes
show remarkable ﬂuctuations in size and organization,
even among close relatives, and all examined angiosperms
have undergone one or more ancient WGD (6). In
contrast, karyotype evolution among major vertebrate
lineages appears to have been slower, with a single
whole-genome duplication event 500 million years ago
(4,7).
However,
hundreds
of
invertebrates
are
paleopolyploids (8) and their rates of chromosomal re-
arrangement have been suggested to be almost twice that
of vertebrates (1,9,10). Further, there is also a remarkable
lack of synteny and high rate of rearrangement in the
parasitic and pathogenic protistan phylum Apicomplxa
compared to what is seen in vertebrates (11).
Traditionally, synteny was identiﬁed via the clustering
of neighboring matching gene pairs, as implemented in
various programs including ADHoRe (12), TEAM (13),
LineUp (14), the Max-gap Clusters by Multiple Sequence

However, detection of synteny is often complicated by
gene
loss,
tandem
duplications,
gene
transpositions
and chromosomal rearrangements, any of which may
produce artifacts. Collinearity, a more speciﬁc form of
synteny, requires conserved gene order. More recent
methods
apply
dynamic
programming
to
chains
of
pair-wise collinear genes, and often specify a certain
scoring scheme that rewards the adjacent collinear gene
pairs (or ‘anchor genes’) and penalizes the distance
between anchor genes. This class of methods has been
implemented in software tools such as DAGchainer (17),
ColinearScan (18), MCScan (19), SyMAP (20), FISH (21)
and CYNTENATOR (22). In addition to algorithmic
differences,
synteny
and
collinearity
detection
tools
often differ in application ranges, inputs, presentation of
results and/or computational costs.
Although
pair-wise
collinear
relationships
among
chromosomal regions have been widely studied, the
multi-alignment (alignment of three or more regions) of
collinear chromosomal regions (referred to as collinear
blocks) is more important as it can reveal ancient WGD
events (19,23) and complex chromosomal duplication/
rearrangement relationships (24). Collinear blocks are
comprised of anchor genes which are located at collinear
positions and non-anchor genes which are assumed to
have experienced gene gains, losses or transposition.
Further, anchor genes are more likely to be homologs
(25) and tend to be under stronger purifying selection
than non-anchor genes (26). Patterns of synteny and
collinearity can provide insight into the evolutionary
history of a genome, and inform on potentially useful
downstream analyses. However, although graphic inter-
faces for visualizing synteny and collinearity may be
incorporated,
many
available
software
packages
for
synteny
and
collinearity
detection
do
not
directly
provide downstream analysis tools. Further, genes may
be duplicated by mechanisms other than whole-genome
duplication, such as tandem, proximal and/or dispersed
duplications, each of which may make different contribu-
tions to evolution (11,27). In addition, analysis of gene
family evolution may require that it be placed in the
context of genome evolution. To analyze the evolution
of a genome, it may be helpful to correlate gene family
analysis with different duplication modes for a more
integrated view. To our knowledge, only the MicroSyn
package (28) provides analysis of collinearity within gene
families, but it cannot superimpose such analysis on
a context of whole-genome collinearity.
MCScan is able to identify collinear blocks in genomes
or subgenomes and then conduct multi-alignments of col-
linear blocks using collinear genes as anchors (19,23).
MCScan is also customizable for genomes of different
sizes and with different average intergenic distances.
Using MCScan, a Plant Genome Duplication Database
(PGDD) has been constructed and is publicly available
at http://chibba.pgml.uga.edu/duplication/. The MCScan
software package and PGDD database have been applied
to a variety of research areas such as genome duplication
and evolution (11,29–36), annotation of newly sequenced
genomes (37) and the evolution of gene families (38–48).
Building on the MCScan algorithm, here we describe
a software package named MCScanX for synteny and col-
linearity detection, visualization and diverse downstream
analyses.
Compared
with
MCScan,
the
usage
of
MCScanX has been greatly simpliﬁed. To more clearly
show how frequently chromosomal regions are duplicated,
multi-alignments of collinear blocks against reference
chromosomes can be viewed through a web browser
with various highlighted features (e.g. tandem arrays,
coverage statistics). The overall pattern of synteny and
collinearity between or among genomes can be visualized
by up to four types of plots. Compared with existing
synteny
and
collinearity
detection
tools,
a
distinct
feature of MCScanX is that diverse tools for evolutionary
analyses of synteny and collinearity are incorporated,
aiding efforts to construct gene families using collinearity
information, infer gene duplication modes and enrich-
ments, characterize collinear genes with nucleotide substi-
tution rates, detect collinear tandem arrays, perform
statistical analyses of duplication depths and collinear
orthologs, and analyze collinearity within gene families.
MCScanX enables rapid and convenient conversion of
synteny and collinearity information into evolutionary
insights.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Gene set and homology search
Whole-genome protein sequences and gene positions for
Arabidopsis thaliana, Populus trichocarpa, Vitis vinifera,
Glycine max, Oryza sativa and Brachypodium distachyon
were
retrieved
from
Phytozome
v7.0
(http://www
.phytozome.net/). Whole-genome protein sequences and
gene positions for Sorghum bicolor and Zea mays were
retrieved from EnsemblPlants (http://plants.ensembl.org/
index.html) and MaizeSequence Release 5b.60 (http://
www.maizesequence.org/index.html)
respectively.
If
a
gene had more than one transcript, only the ﬁrst transcript
in the annotation was used. To search for homology, the
protein-coding genes from each genome was compared
against itself and other genomes using BLASTP (49).
For a protein sequence, the best ﬁve non-self hits in
each target genome that met an E-value threshold of
105 were reported.
MCScanX algorithm
The MCScanX algorithm is a modiﬁed version of MCScan
(19). Whole-genome BLASTP results are used to compute
collinear blocks for all possible pairs of chromosomes and
scaffolds. First, BLASTP matches are sorted according to
gene positions. To avoid high numbers of local collinear
gene pairs due to tandem arrays, if consecutive BLASTP
matches have a common gene and its paired genes are
separated
by
fewer
than
ﬁve
genes,
these
matches
are
collapsed
using
a
representative
pair
with
the
smallest BLASTP E-value. Then, dynamic programming
is employed to ﬁnd the highest scoring paths (i.e. chains of
collinear gene pairs) using the following scoring schema,
assuming that two gene pairs, u and v, are on the path
where u precedes v,

where by default MatchScore(v) = 50 for one gene pair,
GapPenalty = 1, and NumberofGaps (u,v), the maximum
number of intervening genes between u and v, should be
fewer than 25. Non-overlapping chains with scores over
250 (i.e. involving at least 5 collinear gene pairs) are
reported. In a pair of collinear blocks, there are two
distinct genomic locations with aligned collinear genes
as anchors.
The expected number of occurrences (E-value) of a
pair of collinear blocks is estimated using the formula
introduced by Wang et al. (18),
E ¼ 2Pm
N
Y
m1
i¼1
ðl1i

 l2i
L2
Þ
where N is the number of matching gene pairs between the
two chromosomal regions deﬁned by the pair of collinear
blocks, m is the number of anchors in the pair of collinear
blocks, L1 and L2 are respective lengths of the two
chromosomal regions, and l1i and l2i are distances (in
terms of nucleotide numbers) between two adjacent
anchors in the pair of collinear blocks. The default
E-value cutoff of MCScanX is 105.
Multiple chromosomal regions threaded by consecutive
ancestral loci are progressively aligned against reference
chromosomes, where each genome being tested is used
as a reference successively, according to the following pro-
cedure: (i) any reference chromosome is scanned from
start to end, and empty tracks are placed alongside the
reference chromosome to hold potential aligned collinear
blocks; (ii) collinear blocks are progressively aligned
against reference chromosomes pinpointed by anchors
and assigned to the nearest empty tracks (once a track
region is ﬁlled, it cannot be assigned collinear blocks
again). In aligned collinear blocks, only symbols of
anchor genes are shown while un-matched positions
(gaps) between anchors (regardless of numbers of inter-
vening genes) are denoted by ‘jj’; (iii) at each locus of
reference chromosomes, the number of tracks occupied
by collinear blocks is recorded to reﬂect the duplication
depth.
Classiﬁcation of duplicate gene origins
Genes within a single genome can be classiﬁed as single-
tons, dispersed duplicates, proximal duplicates, tandem
duplicates and segmental/WGD duplicates depending
on their copy number and genomic distribution. The fol-
lowing procedure is used to assign gene classes: (i) All
genes are initially classiﬁed as ‘singletons’ and assigned
gene ranks according to their order of appearance along
chromosomes; (ii) BLASTP results are evaluated and the
genes with BLASTP hits to other genes are re-labeled as
‘dispersed duplicates’; (iii) In any BLASTP hit, the two
genes are re-labeled as ‘proximal duplicates’ if they have
a difference of gene rank<20 (conﬁgurable); (iv) In any
BLASTP hit, the two genes are re-labeled as ‘tandem
duplicates’ if they have a difference of gene rank = 1;
(v) MCScanX is executed. The anchor genes in collinear
blocks are re-labeled as ‘WGD/segmental’. So, if a gene
appears in multiple BLASTP hits, it will be assigned a
unique class according to the order of priority: WGD/
segmental>tandem>proximal>dispersed.
Detection of orthologous gene pairs using OrthoMCL
Whole-genome
protein
sequences
from
Arabidopsis,
Populus, Vitis, Glycine, Oryza, Brachypodium, Sorghum
and Zea were merged and searched against themselves
for homology using BLASTP with an E-value cutoff of
105. Default parameters of OrthoMCL (50) were used.
The
combination
of
OrthoMCL
intermediate
ﬁles
‘orthologs.txt’
and
‘coorthologs.txt’
(generated
by
orthomclDumpPairsFiles) was used as the whole set of
ortholog pairs.
Enrichment analysis
Enrichment analysis is performed using Fisher’s exact test.
The P-value was calculated for the null hypothesis that
there is no association between the members of a gene
family and a particular gene duplication mode and is
corrected with the total number of duplication modes
for multiple comparisons (i.e. Bonferroni correction).
The P-value cutoff of 0.05 is used to suggest putative
enrichment of certain gene duplication modes.
Computing Ka and Ks
Non-synonymous (Ka) and synonymous (Ks) substitution
rates are estimated by Nei-Gojobori statistics (51), avail-
able through the ‘Bio::Align::DNAStatistics’ module of
the
BioPerl
package
(http://www.bioperl.org/wiki/
Module:Bio::Align::DNAStatistics).
Note
that
the
‘Bio::Align::DNAStatistics’ module may generate invalid
Ka or Ks (i.e. non-digital output) for some homologous
gene pairs due to mis-alignments.
Gene family examples
Lists of published Arabidopsis gene families were ob-
tained from TAIR (http://www.arabidopsis.org/browse/
genefamily/index.jsp). Only families with more than nine
genes were considered in order to have enough statistical
power
to
detect
enrichment
of
duplication
modes.
Arabidopsis disease resistance gene homologs were down-
loaded from the NIBLRRS Project website (http://niblrrs
.ucdavis.edu).
Execution of the MCScanX package
MCScanX is freely available at http://chibba.pgml.uga
.edu/mcscan2. All programs in the MCScanX package
should be executed using command line arguments on
Mac OS or Linux systems. On Mac OS, Xcode (http://
developer.apple.com/xcode/) should be installed prior to
the installation of MCScanX package. On Linux systems,
the Java SE Development Kit (JDK) and ‘libpng’ should
be installed before the installation of MCScanX package.
To list available command line options, the user can
simply type the name of a program without any options.

RESULTS
Structure of the MCScanX package
The MCScanX package consists of two main components:
(i) three core programs that implement an adjusted
MCScan algorithm to generate pairwise and multiple
alignments of collinear blocks and (ii) 12 downstream
analysis programs for displaying and analyzing identiﬁed
synteny and collinearity output by the core programs. The
structure of the MCScanX package is shown in Figure 1.
Compared with the previous version (0.8) of MCScan,
there are numerous improvements in MCScanX. First,
preprocessing of BLASTP input has been pipelined into
the execution of core programs. Next, in MCScan, each
gene was assigned a family ID to identify tandem genes,
where the family ID has to be pre-computed using the
Markov Clustering Algorithm (MCL) software (52).
In MCScanX, tandem genes are assessed by gene rank
according to chromosomal positions and thus, execution
of MCL is no longer required. The aforementioned two
improvements have made the installation and execution
of MCScanX easier and more efﬁcient. Furthermore,
multi-alignments of collinear blocks, which are output as
HTML ﬁles in MCScanX, can be easily and clearly
viewed. In addition, numerous visualization and down-
stream
analysis
tools
are
incorporated
into
the
MCScanX package, greatly enhancing the biological
applications of the MCScan algorithm. In the following,
we describe in detail each program in the MCScanX
package.
The ﬁrst core program, named MCScanX, can generate
both pair-wise and multiple alignments of collinear
blocks, similar to the previous MCScan version (0.8).
However, MCScanX takes only a simpliﬁed GFF format
ﬁle and a BLASTP tabular ﬁle as inputs. The simpliﬁed
GFF ﬁle should contain the gene locations (which include
chromosome, gene symbol, start and end) for the genomes
to be compared. The BLASTP input ﬁle is one BLASTP
output or combined multiple BLASTP outputs in tabular
format
(option
‘-m8’
in
BLAST
and
‘outfmt
6’
in BLAST+) for all protein sequences in the species of
interest.
Note
that
when
MCScanX
is
applied
to
multiple species, it may be useful to guard against
over-enrichment
of
gene
pairs
from
closely
related
species and we recommend that the BLASTP input ﬁle
include the combined BLASTP outputs of pairwise
genome comparisons and self-genome comparisons with
a cutoff of best hits instead of a single BLASTP output of
pooled
protein
sequences
from
different
species.
Alternatively, the BLASTP input can be replaced by a
tab-delimited ﬁle containing pair-wise homologous rela-
tionships detected by third party software. In this case,
the user needs to implement MCScanX_h (the second
core program). In addition, MCScanX_h can generate
statistics
on
numbers
of
collinear
homolog
pairs
and their percentages (relative to the numbers of input
homolog pairs).
We also adopted an adjusted MCScan algorithm.
Matches among genes are ﬁrst sorted according to
chromosomal positions for all possible pairs of chromo-
somes
and
scaffolds,
and
in
both
transcriptional
directions. Adjacent collinear genes are chained using
dynamic programming (see ‘Materials and Methods’
section),
outputting
pairwise
collinear
blocks
and
tandem gene pairs to ‘.collinearity’ and ‘.tandem’ ﬁles
respectively. Note that during the chaining of collinear
genes, distances between genes are calculated in terms of
differences in gene ranks. Use of differences in gene ranks
provides relative gene distances, which can mitigate the
effects of different gene densities (per unit physical
DNA) among species on collinearity detection. Next,
multiple chromosomal regions threaded by consecutive
anchor loci are progressively aligned against ‘reference’
genomes. Because there could be many intervening/
non-anchor genes between consecutive anchor genes,
especially
for
divergent
genomes,
the
alignment
of
non-anchor genes is highly ﬂexible and could clutter the
view of results. Thus, in MCScanX, the alignment among
non-anchor genes is discarded in the output and non-
anchor genes (mismatches) are simply denoted by ‘jj’ in
the multi-alignment of gene orders. As a result, the layout
of multiple alignments is less affected by alignment par-
ameters and anchor genes and duplication depths can
be easily discerned in the resulting multiple alignments.
The results of MCScanX multiple alignments are pre-
sented in HTML format with variously colored features
that can be displayed using a web browser. An example is
shown in Figure 2. In a reference chromosome, both
anchor and non-anchor genes are shown, while in
aligned collinear blocks only anchor genes are shown.
Along the reference chromosome, duplication depth
(i.e. number of aligned collinear blocks) is shown at each
locus to indicate how frequently chromosomal regions are
duplicated, and tandem genes are highlighted in red. In
principle, all aligned collinear blocks can be also refer-
ences. Note that in certain cases, in a speciﬁc alignment
(e.g. A–B–C), an anchor locus is lost in the reference
chromosome (A) and in turn cannot be shown in aligned
collinear blocks (B and C) due to the non-reciprocity of
the employed algorithm. To study differential gene loss,
the user is suggested to analyze the results using the gene
or genome of interest as the reference (i.e. the alignments
B–A–C and C–A–B can show that the anchor locus exists
between B and C but is lost in A) to ensure that complete
chromosomal neighborhoods and matching segments
are observed.
The third core program, named duplicate gene classiﬁer,
can classify the duplicate genes of a single species into
WGD/segmental, tandem, proximal and dispersed dupli-
cates. WGD/segmental duplicates are inferred by the
anchor genes in collinear blocks. Tandem duplicates are
deﬁned as paralogs that are adjacent to each other on
chromosomes, which are suggested to arise from illegitim-
ate chromosomal recombination (27). Proximal duplicates
are paralogs near each other, but interrupted by several
other genes (e.g. separated by fewer than 20 genes, conﬁg-
urable). Proximal duplicates are inferred to result from
localized transposon activities (53), or ancient tandem
arrays
interrupted
by
more
recent
gene
insertions.
Dispersed duplicates are paralogs that are neither near
each other on chromosomes, nor do they show conserved
synteny (54). Distant single gene translocations mediated

by transposons may explain the wide spread of dispersed
duplicates (27), often via pack-MULEs (55), helitrons
(56), or CACTA elements (37) in plant genomes, or
through
‘retropositions’
(57).
Inferences
about
the
mechanism(s) responsible for duplication of genes may
reveal unusual evolutionary characteristics for particular
lineages.
Duplicate
gene
classiﬁer,
incorporating
the
MCScanX procedure, takes in the same input ﬁles as
MCScanX,
and
returns
statistics
of
duplicate
gene
origins and a ﬁle showing the likely origin of each gene.
Once the outputs of the core programs are generated,
various visualization and downstream analysis tools can
be applied. To display synteny and collinearity, four types
of plots can be generated: dual synteny plot (Figure 3A),
circle plot (Figure 3B), dot plot (Figure 3C) and bar plot
(Figure 3D) using the Java programs: dual synteny plotter,
circle plotter, dot plotter and bar plotter, respectively. The
‘.collinearity’
ﬁle
generated
by
MCScanX
can
be
annotated with non-synonymous (Ka) and synonymous
(Ks) substitution rates using the Perl program add ka
and ks to collinearity.pl. Gene families constructed based
on collinear relationships (instead of BLAST hits) can be
generated based on the ‘.collinearity’ ﬁle using the Perl
program group collinear genes. It may be interesting to
see how frequently chromosomal regions are duplicated
within or across species for understanding species-speciﬁc
or shared evolutionary events, and the program dissect
multiple alignment can compute the number of intra- and
inter-species collinear blocks at each locus of reference
genomes and show statistics on gene numbers at different
duplication depths. To avoid high numbers of local col-
linear gene pairs generated by MCScanX due to tandem
arrays, tandem matches are collapsed using a representa-
tive pair with the smallest BLASTP E-value during
MCScanX execution. However, a tandem array at an
ancestral locus may imply positional gene family expan-
sion (58). Thus, a tool named detect collinear tandem
arrays is provided for detection of collinear tandem
arrays.
The MCScanX package provides a variety of tools for
analyzing gene family evolution based on the synteny and
collinearity identiﬁed by MCScanX. Origin enrichment
analysis can detect potential enrichment of duplicate
gene origins for gene families, based on the classiﬁcation
of whole-genome duplicate genes (the output of duplicate
gene classiﬁer). Detect collinearity within gene families
outputs all collinear gene pairs among gene family
members. Family circle plotter can detect all collinear
gene pairs within a gene family and plot them using a
genomic circle Family tree plotter, with a Newick-format
tree (direct results from most phylogenetic software) and
‘.collinearity’ and ‘.tandem’ ﬁles (generated by MCScanX)
as inputs, can graphically annotate a phylogenetic tree
with collinear and tandem relationships.
Application examples
Estimation of the number of WGD events. MCScan
version 0.8 was implemented to estimate the number of
WGD events of Arabidopsis, Carica, Populus and Vitis,
through analysis of the duplication depths of their collin-
ear blocks using Vitis as the reference genome (19,23).
To facilitate this analysis using the output of MCScanX,
the tool dissect multiple alignment is provided. When the
user applies the MCScanX package, the BLASTP and
GFF inputs should be restricted to a single genome for
self-genome comparison or between two genomes for
cross-genome comparison. Alternatively, a BLASTP of
self-genome comparison and cross-genome comparison

depth and gene symbol at each locus of reference chromosomes, where tandems are marked in red. The remaining columns show aligned collinear

may be merged for both comparisons. However, self-
genome
comparison
may
not
be
as
sensitive
as
cross-genome comparison due to the differential loss of
functionally redundant genes, sometimes in a complemen-
tary fashion (19). Although the determination of an exact
number of WGD events may be heuristic, the output of
‘dissect multiple alignment’ can give a reasonable estimate.
Note that a duplication depth x indicates that there are x
and x+1 aligned collinear blocks in the target genome
using cross-genome and self-genome comparisons respect-
ively. For example, ‘dissect multiple alignment’ was applied
to
both
self-genome
and
cross-genome
comparisons
between Arabidopsis and Vitis. Using Arabidopsis and
Vitis as references, the maximum duplication depths of
Arabidopsis collinear blocks are 7 (self-genome compari-
son, so the maximum number of aligned Arabidopsis col-
linear blocks is 8) and 11 (cross-genome comparison,
so the maximum number of aligned Arabidopsis collinear
blocks is 11), respectively, suggesting that the lineage
experienced at least three WGD events to achieve this
duplication depth, i.e. a triplication WGD event g  two
duplication WGD events a and b (6,19,23). By applying

dissect multiple alignment to self-genome comparison of
Vitis, the maximum duplication depth of Vitis collinear
blocks is 4. However, the gene numbers at levels 3 and
4 (297 and 6, respectively) are much smaller than at level
2 (6993). A whole-genome triplication (WGT) plus small
scale chromosomal duplications is the simplest explan-
ation for this duplication pattern (19,23). Note that
analysis of duplication depths of collinear blocks can
generate
good
estimates
on
relatively
recent
WGD
events. Very ancient WGD events often do not result
in discernable collinear blocks in extant species due to
extensive chromosome rearrangement, loss or gain of
chromosomal segments, loss or transposition of duplicate
genes, horizontal gene transfers, etc. A recent study,
through analyzing the phylogenetic trees of cross-species
gene families, reported two ancestral WGD events for seed
plants and angiosperms respectively (59).
Detection of collinear orthologs. Detection of collinear
orthologs is important for understanding gene evolution.
The comparison between collinear orthologs and all
orthologs can reveal how gene orders are conserved (or
inversely, how frequently chromosomes are rearranged)
between species. Limited only by the state of a genome’s
annotation and the assumption that sufﬁcient sequence
similarity is present for detection, a complete set of
orthologs for a set of species can be generated by
third-party software such as OrthoMCL (50). We imple-
mented
OrthoMCL
to
ﬁnd
ortholog
pairs
among
Arabidopsis, Populus, Vitis, Glycine, Rice, Brachypodium,
Sorghum and Zea. The ortholog pairs identiﬁed by
OrthoMCL were regarded as the whole set of orthologs,
and were then used as the input of MCScanX_h. Besides
standard
MCScanX
output,
MCScanX_h
generated
statistics on the numbers of collinear ortholog pairs and
all ortholog pairs, and percentages of collinear ortholog
pairs between any two of the selected angiosperm genomes
(Table 1). As expected, gene order is better conserved
within monocots and within eudicots than between
monocots and eudicots. Within eudicots, Vitis shows the
highest level of collinearity with the other 3 species, sug-
gesting that Vitis most closely resemble the gene order of
the eudicot ancestral genome, due in part to the lack
of recent WGDs (60).
Differences
in
duplicate
gene
origins
among
angiosperms. Using self-genome BLASTP outputs and
the tool duplicate gene classiﬁer, we classiﬁed the origins
of duplicate genes for Arabidopsis, Populus, Vitis, Glycine,
Oryza, Brachypodium, Sorghum and Zea respectively. The
results are shown in Table 2. The collinear blocks in the
self-genome comparisons result from segmental or whole-
genome duplications. Most collinear blocks within these
ﬂowering plant genomes were derived from WGDs
because of their high coverage throughout the genome
as well as supporting Ks evidence (19).
WGDs have had different impacts on the gene reper-
toires of the investigated taxa. Strikingly, 76.0% of
Glycine genes were duplicated and retained from WGD
events, versus only 14.5% of Oryza genes. The propor-
tions of genes involved in WGD events may reﬂect the
relative timing of the most recent WGD event, as well
as the level of gene retention following the WGD.
For example, Vitis, with only 15.0% of genes created by
WGD (actually WGT), was inferred to have undergone
the g WGT event, which likely predated the divergence of
most eudicots >100 million years ago (19,23). Other
eudicot lineages have experienced lineage-speciﬁc WGDs
in addition to the shared g event. Twenty-seven percent of
Arabidopsis appear to have been created through WGD,
having experienced a and b WGD events since its diver-
gence from other members of the Brassicales clade (6,23).
Populus, with 51.6% of genes created by WGD, was
inferred to have undergone an additional WGD event in
the Salicoid lineage (23). Glycine, with the highest propor-
tion of WGD genes, was reported to have experienced
two additional WGD events, with the most recent
occurring 13 million years ago (61). A total of 29.2% of
Zea genes were created through WGD, which experienced
a lineage-speciﬁc WGD after its divergence from Sorghum

(15.2% genes created by WGD) (62,63). Although tandem
genes are volatile after gene duplication, those retained
may
indicate
functional
signiﬁcance.
We
ﬁnd
that
tandem genes account for about 1–3% of genes in each
genome, smaller than 10% reported by Rizzon et al.
(64). This difference is due to the algorithm of duplicate
gene classiﬁer, which treats the tandem duplicates located
at ancestral loci as WGD duplicates. Proximal duplicates
account for larger proportions of genes in the genomes
with fewer WGD duplicates, e.g. there are 5.4% of
Oryza
genes
and
6.7%
of
Vitis
genes
created
by
proximal
duplications,
while
in
other
genomes,
the
numbers of proximal duplicates are comparable to those
of tandem duplicates.
Detection of collinear tandem arrays. In the MCScanX
package, tandem arrays are deﬁned as clusters of consecu-
tive tandem duplicates. Via ‘detect collinear tandem
arrays’, tandem arrays are ﬁrst determined according to
successive gene ranks in all chromosomes. Collinear gene
pairs are then searched against these tandem arrays. If any
gene of a collinear pair is located within a tandem array,
the gene is replaced by the tandem array and then
reported. If a tandem array is located at an anchor locus
of a collinear block, it is termed a collinear tandem array.
Collinear tandem arrays can indicate positional gene
family expansions (58), which could be important for
forming large gene families, or adopted as an alternative
path to increasing gene copy number in the genomes that
experienced fewer WGD events. For example, we applied
the tool ‘detect collinear tandem arrays’ to a comparison of
the Arabidopsis and Vitis genomes. A total of 1160 pairs of
collinear
tandem
arrays
were
detected
between
Arabidopsis and Vitis, of which only 68 (5.9%) pairs
have
equal
numbers
of
tandem
duplicates
in
each
species, while 54.3% of pairs have more tandem duplicates
in Vitis than Arabidopsis. In conjunction with the ﬁnding
above that Vitis has more proximal duplicates than other
species, we suggest that tandem and proximal duplications
contribute relatively more to the expansion of the Vitis
genome than to other eudicots that experienced more
WGDs in their evolutionary histories.
Analysis of gene family evolution. While MCScanX can
detect
synteny
and
collinearity
using
whole-genome
homology and gene positional information, it is also of
interest to analyze collinearity within a gene family,
toward clarifying gene family evolution (65). We used
the Arabidopsis MADS-box gene family as an example
to illustrate the usefulness of MCScanX for analyzing
the history of gene family expansion. Using the tool
‘detect collinearity with gene families’, we detected 14 col-
linear gene pairs from the members of the MADS box
gene family. The inferred collinear relationships of the
MADS box gene family members can be displayed and
placed within the context of whole-genome collinearity
using a genomic circle generated by ‘family circle plotter’
(Figure 4). Next, a phylogenetic tree was constructed for
the MADS box gene family using PhyML package (66).
The Newick tree was then used as the input of ‘family tree
plotter’. A plot that showed the phylogenetic tree, collin-
ear and tandem relationships for the MADS box gene
family was generated (Figure 5). The overlay of positional

history over the gene clades reveals interesting character-
istics of the MADS-box gene family. We note that the
clade with many collinear relationships (WGD or segmen-
tally duplicated) appears to be the MIKCc-type (67). In
contrast, the remaining clades of MADS-box genes appear
to favor dispersed duplications (27,68).
The tool ‘origin enrichment analysis’, which is able to
detect potential enrichments of duplicate gene origins,
was applied to 126 published Arabidopsis gene families
of 10 or more genes, available at TAIR (http://www.
arabidopsis.org/).
We
found
that
46
(36.5%)
gene
families were enriched for at least one of the four types
of origins at a = 0.05. For example, disease resistance
gene homologs and the cytochrome P450 gene family are
enriched for dispersed and proximal duplicates, while the
cytoplasmic ribosomal protein gene family and C2H2 zinc
ﬁnger proteins are enriched for WGD duplicates, as pre-
viously noted (68).
Comparison with other synteny and collinearity tools
Existing tools for synteny and collinearity detection
mainly include ADHoRe (12), TEAM (13), LineUp (14),
MCMuSeC (15), OrthoCluster (16), DiagHunter (69),
DAGChainer (17), ColinearScan (18), MCScan (19),
SyMAP (20), FISH (21), Cyntenator (22), MicroSyn (28)
and Cinteny (70), of which OrthoCluster, ADHoRe and
SyMAP are currently upgraded to OrthoClusterDB (71),
i-ADHoRe 3 (72) and SyMAP 3.4 (73), respectively.
We summarized the functions of synteny and collinearity
detection tools regarding ﬁve elements: graphic visual-
ization, operation on multiple (>2) genomes, multi-
alignments,
evolutionary
analyses
of
synteny
and
collinearity (e.g. estimating WGD events, gene-order
conservation and duplicate gene origins, constructing
collinear gene groups/families, etc.) and analyses of gene
families. Functional comparison of different synteny and
collinearity detection tools is shown in Table 3. If there
were multiple versions for a tool, we used the latest one for
comparison. Seven tools output synteny or collinearity
information as plain texts, while the other tools provide
graphic visualization options, though types and numbers
of plots vary among different tools. As for the data scale,
most tools published in the past 4 years can operate on
multiple
genomes.
Five
tools
can
perform
multi-
alignments of collinear blocks. MicroSyn is focused on
collinearity analysis within gene families. i-ADHoRe 3
has provided several post-processing programs for dissect-
ing multi-alignments of collinear blocks, in addition
to detecting and visualizing synteny and collinearity.
Among these synteny and collinearity detection tools, 11
tools
cover
no
more
than
two
functions,
and
OrthoclusterDB, MicroSyn and i-ADHoRe 3 cover three
functions. MCScanX, with all ﬁve functions, can perform
more biological analyses than any other synteny or
collinearity detection tool.
MCScanX is unique in providing multiple programs for
evolutionary analysis of synteny and collinearity, which
are
a
necessary
step
towards
biological
discovery.
Further, MCScanX has connected collinearity analyses
between whole-genome and gene family scales. To our

knowledge, the following biological analyses implemented
in MCScanX are not yet available in other synteny and
collinearity detection tools: constructing gene families
using collinearity information, inferring gene duplication
modes
and
enrichments,
detecting
collinear
tandem
arrays, performing statistical analyses of duplication
depths and collinear orthologs and annotating phylogen-
etic trees with collinearity and tandems.
For synteny and collinearity detection tools, effective
identiﬁcation of collinear gene pairs is the basis for
collinear block construction and downstream analyses.
It is informative to perform a quantitative evaluation of
MCScanX on the identiﬁcation of collinear gene pairs.
Two widely implemented tools, MCScan and i-ADHoRe
3 were chosen as competitors. Since a benchmark for
assessing synteny and collinearity tools has not been
established (72), we compared their performances by
applying them to the Arabidopsis thaliana genome. Note
that a higher number of detected collinear gene pairs does
not simply indicate better performance, as true and false
positives must be simultaneously considered and well
balanced (69). A total of 5794 collinear gene pairs (i.e.
WGD duplicate gene pairs) in the Arabidopsis genome
including 3822 a, 1451 b and 521 g pairs proﬁled using
an
integrated
phylogenomic
approach
in
the
study
from Bowers et al. (6), were regarded as the whole set of
collinear gene pairs. The performances of MCScan,
MCScanX and i-ADHoRe 3 were evaluated by power
(i.e. sensitivity), deﬁned as the ratio between numbers of
true positives and all collinear gene pairs; and precision,
deﬁned as the ratio between numbers of true positives and
all positives (i.e. true positives+false positives). When
MCScan and MCScanX were compared, the same param-
eters were used. Based on the default parameters of
MCScanX (match size = 5, max gaps = 25), MCScan
and MCScanX identiﬁed 4134 and 4225 collinear gene
pairs, of which 3375 and 3407 were true positives, respect-
ively. Power was 0.58 and 0.59, and precision was 0.82
and 0.81 for MCScan and MCScanX, respectively. The
above statistics suggest that MCScan and MCScanX are
generally comparable in detecting collinear gene pairs,
while MCScanX has a slightly higher power and a
slightly lower precision. Based on its default parameters,
i-ADHoRe 3 identiﬁed 6233 non-overlapping collinear
gene pairs, of which 3459 were true positives. Its power
and precision was 0.60 and 0.55. However, direct compari-
son between MCScanX and i-ADHoRe 3 using their
respective
default
parameters
was
not
reasonable
because i-ADHoRe 3 output many more positives. To
this end, we executed MCScan and MCScanX using a
more relaxed set of parameters (match size = 3, max
gaps = 50), which output 5554 and 6110 positives, respect-
ively. Based on the new parameters, power was 0.65 and
0.67, and precision was 0.68 and 0.64 for MCScan
and MCScanX, respectively. The new statistics suggest
that in terms of identiﬁcation of collinear gene pairs,
MCScan
and
MCScanX
each
perform
better
than
i-ADHoRe 3 and remain comparable to one another,
with MCScan having higher precision and MCScanX
having higher power. The small difference between
MCScan and MCScanX is because in order to make
MCScanX
more
easily
and
efﬁciently
implemented,
pre-processing of BLASTP input was pipelined into the
execution of the main programs and the dependency of
MCL was dropped. In MCScan, cross-family BLASTP
hits are removed based on MCL output, while in
MCScanX, all non-self BLASTP hits are considered,
leading to an enlarged pool of BLASTP hits. MCL may
generate 5–20% incorrect families and its performance is
affected by inﬂation value (a parameter of the MCL algo-
rithm used to control the granularity/tightness of protein
clusters) (52). So the cross-family BLASTP hits based on
MCL gene families indeed contain some collinear gene
pairs, though the proportion of collinear gene pairs is
smaller in cross-family BLASTP hits than in within-family
BLASTP hits. This results in marginally higher power and
lower precision for MCScanX than MCScan, though their
performances on identifying collinear gene pairs are very
similar. Since MCScan was successfully applied to the
distantly related apicomplexans (11), we believe that

MCScanX is also applicable over a wide range of
organisms besides angiosperms.
DISCUSSION
Synteny and collinearity information is important for
elucidating the evolutionary histories of both genomes
and gene families. Although many synteny and collinear-
ity tools are available, their output ﬁles are often difﬁcult
to read and downstream evolutionary analysis programs
are rarely provided. For this reason, users often have to
write
additional
programs
or
reformat
the
synteny
and collinearity output ﬁles in order to use third-party
evolutionary analysis tools. This incompleteness of func-
tionality has reduced the usefulness of existing synteny
and collinearity detection tools. A distinguishing feature
of MCScanX is that diverse tools for evolutionary
analyses of synteny and collinearity are incorporated,
which
enables
rapid
and
convenient
conversion
of
synteny and collinearity information into evolutionary
insights. In addition, many biological analyses imple-
mented in MCScanX are unique. MCScanX can be used
to effectively analyze chromosome structural changes and
evolution, annotate new genomes and reveal the history
of gene family expansions.
In conclusion, MCScanX is a toolkit that implements an
adjusted MCScan algorithm for detection of synteny and
collinearity and incorporates 14 computer programs
for visualizing and analyzing identiﬁed synteny and collin-
earity. The usefulness of the MCScanX toolkit has been
demonstrated through a series of real data applications
and comparison with other synteny and collinearity
detection tools. MCScanX is freely available at http://
