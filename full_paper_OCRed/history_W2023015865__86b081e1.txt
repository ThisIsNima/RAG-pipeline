There is a movement afoot in cognitive science to grant
the body a central role in shaping the mind. Proponents of
embodied cognitiontake as their theoretical starting point
not a mind working on abstract problems, but a body that
requires a mind to make it function. These opening lines
by Clark (1998)are typical:“Biologicalbrainsare first and
foremost the control systems for biologicalbodies. Biolog-
ical bodies move and act in rich real-world surroundings”
(p. 506).
Traditionally, the various branches of cognitivescience
have viewed the mind as an abstract information proces-
sor, whose connections to the outside world were of little
theoretical importance. Perceptual and motor systems,
though reasonable objects of inquiry in their own right,
were not considered relevant to understanding “central”
cognitive processes. Instead, they were thought to serve
merely as peripheral input and output devices.This stance
was evident in the early decades of cognitive psychology,
when most theories of human thinking dealt in proposi-
tional forms of knowledge. During the same time period,
artificial intelligencewas dominated by computer models
of abstract symbol processing. Philosophy of mind, too,
made its contribution to this zeitgeist, most notably in
Fodor’s (1983)modularityhypothesis.Accordingto Fodor,
central cognitionis not modular, but its connectionsto the
world are. Perceptual and motor processing are done by
informationally encapsulated plug-ins providing sharply
limited forms of input and output.
However, there is a radically different stance that also has
roots in diverse branches of cognitive science. This stance
has emphasizedsensoryand motorfunctions,as wellas their
importance for successful interactionwith the environment.
Early sourcesincludetheviewof19thcenturypsychologists
that there was no such thing as “imageless thought”(Good-
win, 1999); motor theories of perception such as those sug-
gested by William James and others (see Prinz, 1987, for a
review); the developmental psychology of Jean Piaget,
which emphasized the emergence of cognitive abilities out
of a groundwork of sensorimotor abilities; and the ecologi-
cal psychology of J. J. Gibson, which viewed perception in
terms of affordances— potentialinteractionswith the envi-
ronment. In the 1980s, linguists began exploring how ab-
stract conceptsmay be based on metaphorsfor bodily, phys-
ical concepts (e.g., Lakoff & Johnson, 1980). At the same
time, within the field of artificial intelligence, behavior-
based robotics began to emphasize routines for interacting
with the environment rather than internal representations
used for abstract thought(see, e.g., Brooks, 1986).
This kind of approach has recently attained high visi-
bility, under the banner of embodied cognition.There is a
growing commitment to the idea that the mind must be un-
derstood in the context of its relationship to a physical
body that interactswith the world. It is argued that we have
evolved from creatures whose neural resources were de-
voted primarily to perceptual and motoric processing, and
whose cognitive activity consisted largely of immediate,
on-lineinteractionwiththeenvironment.Hence humancog-
nition, rather than being centralized, abstract, and sharply
distinct from peripheral inputand output modules,may in-
stead have deep roots in sensorimotor processing.
Although thisgeneral approach is enjoyingincreasingly
broad support, there is in fact a great deal of diversity in
the claims involved and the degree of controversy they at-
tract. If the term embodied cognitionis to retain meaning-

THEORETICAL AND REVIEW ARTICLES
Six views of embodied cognition
MARGARET WILSON
University of California, Santa Cruz, California
The emerging viewpoint of embodied cognition holds that cognitive processes are deeply rooted in
the body’s interactions with the world. This position actually houses a number of distinct claims, some
of which are more controversial than others. This paper distinguishes and evaluates the following six
claims: (1) cognition is situated; (2) cognition is time-pressured; (3) we off-load cognitive work onto
the environment; (4) the environment is part of the cognitive system; (5) cognition is for action; (6) off-
line cognition is body based. Of these, the first three and the fifth appear to be at least partially true,
and their usefulnessis bestevaluatedin terms of the range of their applicability.The fourth claim,I argue,
is deeply problematic. The sixth claim has received the least attention in the literature on embodied
cognition, but it may in fact be the best documented and most powerful of the six claims.

ful use, we need to disentangle and evaluate these diverse
claims. Among the most prominent are the following:
1. Cognition is situated. Cognitiveactivitytakes place
in the context of a real-world environment, and it inher-
ently involves perception and action.
2. Cognition is time pressured. We are “mind on the
hoof” (Clark, 1997),and cognitionmust be understoodin
terms of how it functions under the pressures of real-time
interaction with the environment.
3. We off-load cognitivework onto the environment.
Because of limits on our information-processing abilities
(e.g., limitson attentionand working memory), we exploit
theenvironmenttoreducethecognitiveworkload.We make
the environment hold or even manipulate information for
us, and we harvest that information only on a need-to-
know basis.
4. The environment is part of the cognitive system.
The information flow between mind and world is so dense
and continuous that, for scientists studying the nature of
cognitive activity, the mind alone is not a meaningful unit
of analysis.
5. Cognition is for action. The function of the mind is
to guide action, and cognitive mechanisms such as per-
ception and memory must be understood in terms of their
ultimate contribution to situation-appropriate behavior.
6. Off-line cognition is body based. Even when de-
coupled from the environment, the activity of the mind is
groundedin mechanisms that evolved for interactionwith
the environment—that is, mechanisms of sensory pro-
cessing and motor control.
Frequentlyin the literatureon embodiedcognition,sev-
eral or all of these claims are presented together as if they
represented a single point of view. This strategy may have
its uses, as for example in helping to draw a compelling
picture of what embodied cognition might be and why it
might be important. This may have been particularly ap-
propriate at the time that attention first was drawn to this
set of ideas, when audiences were as yet unfamiliar with
this way of conceptualizingcognition.The time has come,
though,to take a more careful look at each of these claims
on its own merits.
Claim 1: Cognition Is Situated
A cornerstone of the embodied cognition literature is
the claim that cognitionis a situated activity(e.g., Chiel &
Beer, 1997; Clark, 1997; Pfeifer & Scheier, 1999; Steels
& Brooks, 1995; a commitment to situated cognition can
also be found in the literature on dynamical systems—
e.g.,Beer, 2000;Port & van Gelder, 1995;Thelen& Smith,
1994; Wiles & Dartnall, 1999). Some authors go so far as
to complain that the phrase “situated cognition” implies,
falsely, that there also exists cognition that is not situated
(Greeno & Moore, 1993, p. 50). It is important, then, that
we be clear on what exactly it means for cognition to be
situated.
Simply put, situated cognition is cognition that takes
place in the context of task-relevant inputs and outputs.
That is, while a cognitiveprocess is beingcarried out, per-
ceptual information continuesto come in that affects pro-
cessing, and motor activity is executed that affects the
environment in task-relevant ways. Driving, holding a
conversation, and moving around a room while trying to
imaginewhere the furniture shouldgo are all cognitiveac-
tivities that are situated in this sense.
Even with this basic definitionof what it means for cog-
nition to be situated, we can note that large portions of
human cognitive processing are excluded. Any cognitive
activity that takes place “off-line,” in the absence of task-
relevantinputand output,is by definitionnot situated.Ex-
amplesincludeplanning,remembering, and day-dreaming,
in contexts not directly relevant to the content of plans,
memories, or day-dreams.
This observation is not new (see, e.g., Clark & Grush,
1999; Grush, 1997), but given the rhetoric currently to be
found in the situated cognition literature, the point is
worth emphasizing. By definition, situated cognition in-
volves interaction with the things that the cognitive activ-
ity is about. Yet one of the hallmarks of human cognition
is that it can take place decoupledfrom any immediate in-
teraction with the environment. We can lay plans for the
future, and think over what has happened in the past. We
can entertain counterfactualsto considerwhat might have
happenedif circumstanceshad been different. We can con-
struct mental representations of situations we have never
experienced,based purely on linguisticinput from others.
In short, our ability to form mental representations about
thingsthat are remote in time and space, which is arguably
the sine qua non of human thought, in principle cannot
yield to a situated cognition analysis.
An argument might be made, though,that situated cog-
nitionis neverthelessthe bedrockof human cognition,due
to in our evolutionary history. Indeed, it is popular to try
to drive intuitions about situated cognition by invoking a
picture of our ancestors relyingalmost entirelyon situated
skills. Before we got civilized,the argument goes, the sur-
vival value of our mental abilities depended on whether
they helped us to act in direct response to immediate situ-
ations such as obtaining food from the environment or
avoiding predators. Thus, situated cognition may repre-
sent our fundamentalcognitivearchitecture, even if this is
not always reflected in the artificial activitiesof our mod-
ern world.
This view of early humans, though, most likely exag-
gerates the role of these survival-related on-line activities
in the daily lives of early humans. With respect to obtain-
ing food, meat eating was a late addition to the human
repertoire, and even after the onset of hunting, the large
majority of calories were probably still obtained from
gathering. Evidence for this claim comes from both the
fossil record and the dietary patterns of hunter/gatherers
today (Leaky, 1994), as well as from the dietary patterns
of our nearest relatives, the chimpanzees and bonobos
(de Waal, 2001). It might be more appropriate, then, to
consider gathering when trying to construct a picture of
our cognitive past. But gathering lends itself much less
well to a picture of human cognitionas situated cognition.

Successful gathering might be expected to benefit a great
deal from human skills of reflective thought—remember-
ing the terrain, coordinating with one’s fellow gatherers,
consideringthe probableimpact of last week’s rain, and so
on. During the actual act of gathering, though, it is not
clear what situatedcognitiveskills humans would bring to
bear beyond those possessed by any foraging animal. (Put
in this light, we can see that even hunting, early human
style, probably involved considerable nonsituated mental
activity as well.)
In addition to chasing food, though, being chased by
predators is also supposed to have been a major shaping
force, according to this picture of the early human as a sit-
uated cognizer. Yet while avoiding predators obviouslyhas
a great deal of survival value, the situated skills of fight-
or-flight are surely ancient,sharedwith many otherspecies.
Again, it is not clear how much mileage can be gotten out
of trying to explain human intelligencein these terms. In-
stead, the cognitive abilities that contributed to uniquely
human strategies for avoiding predation were probably of
quite a different sort. As early humans became increas-
ingly sophisticated in their social abilities, avoiding pre-
dation almost certainly involvedincreasing use of off-line
preventative and communicative measures.
Finally, we shouldconsiderthe mental activitiesthat are
known to have characterized the emerging human popu-
lationand that set themapart from earlier hominid species.
These included increasingly sophisticated tool-making,
particularly the shaping of tools to match a mental tem-
plate; language, allowing communicationabout hypothet-
icals, past events, and other nonimmediate situations;and
depictiveart, showingtheabilitytomentallyrepresent what
is not present, and to engage in representation for repre-
sentation’s sake rather than for any situated functionality
(see Leakey, 1994,for further details).All of these abilities
reflect the increasingly off-line nature of early human
thought. To focus on situated cognition as the fundamen-
tal principleof our cognitivearchitectureis thus to neglect
these species-definingfeatures of human cognition.
A few counterarguments to this can be found in the lit-
erature. Barsalou (1999a), for example, suggests that lan-
guage was used by early humans primarily for immediate,
situated, indexical purposes. These situated uses of lan-
guage were intended to influence the behavior of others
during activities such as hunting, gathering, and simple
manufacturing.However, some of the examplesthatBarsa-
lou gives of situated uses of language appear to be in fact
off-line uses,where thereferent is distantin time or space—
as, for example,in describingdistantterrain to people who
have never seen it. One can easily think of further nonsitu-
ated uses of language that would serve adaptive functions
for early humans:absorbing parentaledicts aboutavoiding
dangerousbehaviors;holdingin mind instructionsfor what
materials to go fetch when helping with tool manufactur-
ing; deciding whether to join in a planned activity such as
going to the river to cool off; and comprehending gossip
aboutmembers of the social hierarchy who are not present.
It seems plausible,then,that languageserved off-linefunc-
tions from early on. Indeed, once the representational ca-
pacity of language emerged, it is unclear why its full ca-
pacity in this respect would not be used.
Along different lines, Brooks (1999, p. 81) argues that
because nonsituatedcognitiveabilitiesemerged late in the
history of animal life on this planet, after extremely long
periods in which no such innovationsappeared,these were
therefore the easy problems for evolution to solve (and
hence, by implication,not of much theoreticalinterest). In
fact, exactly the oppositecan be inferred. Easy evolution-
ary solutionstend to arise again and again,a processknown
as convergent evolution. In contrast, the late emergence
and solitary status of an animal with abilitiessuch as man-
ufacturing to a mental template, language,and artistic de-
pictionattests to a radical and complex innovationin evo-
lutionary engineering.
In short, an argument for the centrality of situated cog-
nition based on the demands of human survivalin the wild
is not strongly persuasive. Furthermore, overstating the
case for situated cognitionmay ultimatelyimpede our un-
derstanding of the aspects of cognition that in fact are sit-
uated. As will be discussed in the next two sections, there
is much to be learned about the ways in which we engage
in cognitive activity that is tightly connected with our on-
going interactionwith the environment.Spatial cognition,
in particular, tends to be situated. Trying to fit a piece into
a jigsawpuzzle,for example,may owe more to continuous
reevaluating of spatial relationshipsthat are being contin-
uously manipulated than it does to any kind of disembod-
ied pattern matching (cf. Kirsh & Maglio, 1994). For cer-
tain kinds of tasks, in fact, humans may actively choose to
situate themselves (see Section 3).
Claim 2: Cognition is Time Pressured
The previoussectionconsidered situated cognitionsim-
ply to mean cognition that is situation bound. There ap-
pears to be more, though, that is often meant by “situated
cognition.”It is frequentlystated that situatedagents must
deal with the constraints of “real time” or “runtime” (see,
e.g., Brooks, 1991b;Pfeifer & Scheier, 1999, chap. 3; van
Gelder & Port, 1995). These phrases are used to highlight
a weakness of traditional artificial intelligence models,
which are generally allowed to build up and manipulate
internal representations of a situation at their leisure. A
real creature in a real environment,it is pointedout, has no
such leisure. It must cope with predators, prey, stationary
objects,and terrain as fast as the situationdishes them out.
The observationthat situatedcognitiontakes place “in real
time” is, at bottom, an observation that situated cognition
must cope with time pressure.
A belief in the importance of time pressure as a shap-
ing force in cognitive architecture underlies much of the
situated cognition literature. For example, in the field of
behavior-based robotics, “autonomous agents” have been
built to perform tasks such as walking on an uneven sur-
face with six legs (Quinn & Espenschied, 1993), brachi-
ating or swinging “branch to branch” like an ape (Saito &
Fukuda, 1994), and navigating around a cluttered envi-

ronment lookingfor soda cans without bumping into any-
thing (Mataric, 1991). Each of these activities requires
real-time responsiveness to feedback from the environ-
ment. And althoughthese activitiesare not especially“in-
telligent” in and of themselves, it is claimed that greater
cognitive complexity can be built up from successive lay-
ers of procedures for real-time interaction with the envi-
ronment (for reviews, see Brooks, 1999; Clark, 1997;
Pfeifer & Scheier, 1999).
A similar emphasis on time pressure as a principle that
shapes cognition can be seen as well in human behavioral
research on situated cognition. For example, Kirsh and
Maglio(1994)have studiedthe procedures that peopleuse
in making time-pressured spatial decisions while playing
thevideogame Tetris(discussedinmore detailin Section3).
This research is conducted with the assumption that situ-
ations such as Tetris playingare a microcosm that can elu-
cidate general principles of human cognition.
One reason that timepressure is thoughtto matter is that
it creates what has been called a “representational bottle-
neck.” When situations demand fast and continuously
evolving responses, there may simply not be time to build
up a full-blown mental model of the environment, from
which to derive a plan of action.Instead, it is argued, being
a situated cognizer requires the use of cheap and efficient
tricks for generating situation-appropriate action on the
fly. (In fact, a debate has raged over whether a situated
cognizerwould make use of internalrepresentationsat all;
see Agre, 1993; Beer, 2000; Brooks, 1991a; Markman &
Dietrich,2000;Vera & Simon,1993.)Thus,takingreal-time
situated action as the starting point for cognitive activity
is argued to have far-reaching consequencesfor cognitive
architecture.
The force of this argument, though, depends upon the
assumption that actual cognizers (humans, for example)
are indeed engineered so as to circumvent this represen-
tationalbottleneckand are capableof functioningwell and
“normally”in time-pressured situations.But althoughone
might wish an ideal cognitive system to have solved the
problem, the assumption that we have solved it is dis-
putable. Confronted with novel cognitive or perceptuo-
motor problems, humans predictablyfall apart under time
pressure. That is, we very often do not successfully cope
with the representational bottleneck. Lift the demands of
time pressure, though, and some of the true power of
human cognitionbecomes evident.Given the opportunity,
we often behavein a decidedlyoff-line way: steppingback,
observing,assessing,planning,and onlythen takingaction.
It is far from clear, then, that the human cognitive system
has evolved an effective engineering solution for the real-
time constraints of the representational bottleneck.
Furthermore, many of the activitiesin which we engage
in daily life, even many that are clearly situated,do not in-
herently involve time pressure. Cases include mundane
activities,such as making sandwiches and paying bills, as
well as more demanding cognitive tasks, such as doing
crossword puzzles and reading scientific papers. In each
of these cases, input from and output to the environment
are necessary, but they are at the leisure of the cognizer.
(Of course, any task can be performed in a hurry, and
many often are. But the state of “being in a hurry” is one
that is cognitivelyself-imposed, and such tasks are gener-
ally performed only as fast as they can be, even if this
means being late.) Situationsin which time pressure is in-
herently part of the task, such as playing video games
or changing lanes in heavy traffic, may actually be the
exception.
This is not to say, though,that an understandingof real-
time interaction with the environmenthas nothing to con-
tribute to our understanding of human cognition. A num-
ber of important domains may indeed be illuminated by
considering them from this standpoint.The most obvious
of these is perceptuomotorcoordinationof any kind.Even
such basic activities as walking require continuous recip-
rocal influence between perceptual flow and motor com-
mands. Skilled hand movement, particularly the manipu-
lation of objectsin the environment,is another persuasive
example of a time-locked perceptuomotor activity. More
sophisticatedforms of real-time situated cognitioncan be
seen in any activity that involves continuous updating of
plans in response to rapidly changing conditions. Such
changing conditions often involve the activity of another
human or animal that must be reckoned with. Examples
include playing a sport, driving in traffic, and roughhous-
ing with a dog. As interesting as the principles governing
these cases may be in their own right, though, the argu-
ment that they can be scaled up to provide the governing
principlesof human cognitionin general appears to be un-
persuasive.
Claim 3: We Off-Load Cognitive Work Onto the
Environment
Despite the fact that we frequently choose to run our
cognitiveprocesses off line, it is still true that in some sit-
uations we are forced to function on line. In those situa-
tions, what do we do about our cognitivelimitations?One
response, as we have seen, is to fall apart. However, hu-
mans are not entirely helpless when confronting the rep-
resentational bottleneck, and two types of strategies ap-
pear to be available when one is confronting on-line task
demands. The first is to rely on preloaded representations
acquired through prior learning (discussed further in Sec-
tion 6). What about novel stimuli and tasks, though? In
these cases there is a second option,which is to reduce the
cognitive workload by making use of the environment it-
self in strategic ways—leaving information out there in
the world to be accessed as needed,rather than takingtime
to fully encode it; and using epistemic actions (Kirsh &
Maglio, 1994) to alter the environment in order to reduce
the cognitive work remaining to be done.
(The environmentcanalsobe usedasa long-termarchive,
as in the use of reference books, appointment calendars,
and computer files. This can be thought of as off-loading
to avoid memorizing, which is subtly but importantly dif-
ferent from off-loading to avoid encoding or holding ac-
tive in short-term memory what is present in the immedi-

ate environment.It is the lattercase that is usuallydiscussed
in the literatureon off-loading.Althoughthe archivalcase
certainly constitutes off-loading, it appears to be of less
theoretical interest. The observation that we use such a
strategy does not seem to challengeor shed light on exist-
ingtheoriesof cognition.The presentdiscussionwill there-
fore be restricted to what we may call the situated exam-
ples of off-loading, which are the focus of the literature.)
Some investigators have begun to examine how off-
loading work onto the environmentmay be used as a cog-
nitive strategy. Kirsh and Maglio (1994), as noted earlier,
have reported a study involvingthe game Tetris, in which
falling block shapes must be rotated and horizontally
translated to fit as compactly as possible with the shapes
that have already fallen. The decision of how to orient and
place each block must be made before the block falls too
far to allow the necessary movements. The data suggest
that players use actualrotation and translationmovements
to simplify the problem to be solved, rather than mentally
computing a solution and then executing it. A second ex-
ample comes from Ballard,Hayhoe, Pook, and Rao (1997),
who asked subjectsto reproducepatternsof colored blocks
undertime pressure by draggingrandomlyscattered blocks
on a computer screen into a work area and arranging them
there. Recorded eye movements showed repeated refer-
encing of the blocks in the model pattern, and these eye
movements occurred at strategic moments—for example,
to gather information first about a block’s color and then
later about its precise location within the pattern. The au-
thors argue that this is a “minimal memory strategy,” and
they show that it is the strategy most commonly used by
subjects.
A few moments’ thought can yield similar examples
from daily life. Not all of them involve time pressure, but
other cognitive limitations, such as those of attention and
working memory, can drive us to a similar kind of off-
loading strategy. One example, used earlier, is that of
physically moving around a room in order to generate so-
lutions for where to put furniture. Other examples include
laying out the pieces of something that requires assembly
in roughly the order and spatialrelationshipsthat they will
have in the finished product, or giving directions for how
to get somewhere by first turning one’s self and one’s lis-
tenerin the appropriatedirection.Glenberg and Robertson
(1999) have experimentally studied one such example,
showing that in a compass-and-map task, subjects who
were allowed to indexicallylink written instructionsto ob-
jects in the environment during a learning phase per-
formed better during a test phase than subjects who were
not, both on comprehension of new written instructions
and on performance of the actual task.
As notedearlier,thiskindofstrategyseems toapplymost
usefully to spatial tasks in particular. But is off-loading
strictly limited to cases in which we manipulatespatial in-
formation? Spatial tasks are only one arena of human
thought. If off-loading is useful only for tasks that are
themselves spatial in nature, its range of applicabilityas a
cognitive strategy is limited.
In fact, though,potentialuses of off-loading may be far
broader than this. Consider, for example, such activities
as countingon one’s fingers, drawing Venn diagrams, and
doingmath with penciland paper. Many of these activities
are both situated and spatial,in the sense that they involve
the manipulation of spatial relationships among elements
in the environment.The advantageis that by doing actual,
physicalmanipulation,rather than computinga solutionin
our heads, we save cognitive work. However, unlike the
previousexamples,there is also a sense in which these ac-
tivities are not situated. They are performed in the service
of cognitive activity about something else, something not
present in the immediate environment.
Typically, the literature on off-loading has focused on
cases in which the world is being used as “its own best
model” (Brooks, 1991a, p. 139). Rather than attempt to
mentallystore and manipulateall the relevantdetailsabout
a situation, we physically store and manipulate those de-
tails out in the world, in the very situation itself. In the
Tetris case, for example, the elements being manipulated
do not serve as tokens for anything but themselves, and
their manipulation does not so much yield information
abouta solutionas producethegoalstate itselfthroughtrial
and error. In contrast, actionssuch as diagramming repre-
sent a quite different use of the environment. Here, the
cognitivesystemis exploitingexternalresources toachieve
a solution or a piece of knowledge whose actual applica-
tion will occur at some later time and place, if at all.
Notice what this buys us. This form of off-loading—
what we might call symbolic off-loading—may in fact be
applied to spatial tasks, as in the case of arranging tokens
for armies on a map; but it may also be applied to non-
spatial tasks, as in the case of using Venn diagrams to de-
termine logical relationsamong categories.When the pur-
pose of the activity is no longer directly linked to the
situation,it also need not be directly linkedto spatialprob-
lems; physicaltokens, and even theirspatial relationships,
can be used to represent abstract, nonspatial domains of
thought. The history of mathematics attests to the power
behind this decoupling strategy. It should be noted, too,
that symbolic off-loading need not be deliberate and for-
malized, but can be seen in such universal and automatic
behaviorsasgesturingwhilespeaking.It hasbeenfound that
gesturing is not epiphenomenal,nor even strictly commu-
nicative, but seems to serve a cognitive function for the
speaker,helpingto grease thewheels of the thoughtprocess
that the speaker is trying to express (see, e.g., Iverson &
Goldin-Meadow, 1998; Krauss, 1998). As we shall see in
Section 6, the use of bodily resources for cognitive pur-
poses not directlylinkedto the situationhas potentiallyfar
reachingconsequencesfor our understandingof cognition
in general.
Claim 4: The Environment Is Part
of the Cognitive System
The insightthat the bodyand theenvironmentplay a role
in assistingcognitiveactivityhas led some authors to assert
a strongerclaim:thatcognitionis notan activityofthe mind

alone, but is instead distributed across the entire interact-
ing situation,includingmind, body, and environment(see,
e.g., Beer, 1995, pp. 182–183; Greeno & Moore, 1993,
p. 49; Thelen & Smith, 1994,p. 17; Wertsch, 1998,p. 518;
see also Clark, 1998,pp. 513–516, for discussion).In fact,
relatively few theorists appear to hold consistently to this
position in its strong form. Nevertheless, an attraction to
something like this claim permeates the literatures on em-
bodiedandsituatedcognition.It is thereforeworth it to bring
the core idea into focus and consider it in some detail.
The claim is this: The forces that drive cognitive activ-
ity do not reside solely inside the head of the individual,
but instead are distributed across the individual and the
situation as they interact. Therefore, to understand cogni-
tion we must study the situation and the situated cognizer
together as a single, unified system.
The first part of this claim is trivially true. Causes of
behavior (and also causes of covert cognitive events such
as thoughts)are surely distributedacross the mind plus en-
vironment. More problematic is the reasoning that con-
nects the first part of the claim with the second part. The
fact that causal control is distributed across the situation
is not sufficient justification for the claim that we must
study a distributedsystem. Science is not ultimatelyabout
explainingthe causality of any particularevent.Instead, it
is about understanding fundamental principles of organi-
zation and function.
Consider, for example, the goal of understandinghydro-
gen. Before 1900,hydrogenhadbeen observedby scientists
in a large number of contexts,and much was known about
its behavior when it interacted with other chemicals. But
none of this behavior was really understood until the dis-
covery in the 20th century of the structure of the atom, in-
cluding the protons, neutrons, and electrons that are its
components and the discrete orbits that electrons inhabit.
Once this was known, not only did all the previous obser-
vations of hydrogen make sense, but the behavior of hy-
drogen could be predicted in interactions with elements
never yet observed.The causes of the behaviorof hydrogen
are always a combination of the nature of hydrogen plus
the specifics of its surrounding context; yet explanatory
satisfaction came from understandingthe workings of the
narrowly definedsystemthatis thehydrogenatom.To have
insisted that we focus on the study of contextualized be-
havior would probably not have led to a theoreticalunder-
standingwith anythinglike this kind of explanatoryforce.
Distributed causality, then, is not sufficient to drive an
argument for distributed cognition. Instead, we must ask
what kind of system we are interested in studying. To an-
swer this, we must consider the meaning of the word sys-
tem as it is being used here. For this purpose, the contri-
butions of systems theorists will be of help. (For a lucid
summary of the issuesdiscussedbelow, see Juarrero, 1999,
chap. 7.)
For a set of things to be considered a system in the for-
mal sense, these things must be not merely an aggregate,
a collection of elements that stand in some relation to one
another (spatial, temporal, or any other relation). The ele-
ments must in addition have properties that are affected
by theirparticipationin the system. Thus, the various parts
of an automobile can be considered as a system because
the action of the spark plugs affects the behavior of the
pistons, the pistons affect the drive shaft, and so on.
But must all things that have an impact on the elements
of a system themselves be considered part of the system?
No. Many systems are open systems, existing within the
context of an environment that can affect and be affected
by the system. (No system short of the entire universe is
truly closed, although some can be considered closed for
practicalpurposes.)Thus,for example,an ecologicalregion
on earth can be considered a system in that the organisms
in that region are integrallydependenton one another;but
the sun need not be considered part of the system, nor the
rivers that flow in from elsewhere, even thoughtheir input
is vital to the ecological system. Instead, the ecological
system can be considered an open system, receiving input
from something outside itself. The fact that open systems
are open is not generally considered a problem for their
analysis,even when mutual influencewith externalforces
is continuous.
From thisdescription,though,it shouldbe clear that how
one defines the boundaries of a system is partly a matter
of judgment and depends on the particular purposes of
one’s analysis.Thus, the sun may not be part of the system
when one considers the earth in biologicalterms, but it is
most definitely part of the system when one considers the
earth in terms of planetary movement. The issue, for any
given scientific enterprise, is how best to carve nature at
its joints.
Where does this leave us with respect to defining a cog-
nitive system? Is it most natural, most scientifically pro-
ductive,to considerthe system to be the mind; or themind,
the body, and certain relevant elements in the immediate
physical environment, all taken together? To help us an-
swer this question,it will be useful to introduce a few addi-
tional concepts regarding systems and how they function.
First, a system is defined by its organization—that is,
the functional relations among its elements. These rela-
tions cannot be changed without changing the identity of
the system. Next, systems can be described as either fac-
ultativeor obligate.Facultativesystems are temporary, or-
ganized for a particular occasion and disbanded readily.
Obligate systems, on the other hand, are more or less per-
manent, at least relative to the lifetime of their parts.
We are now in a position to make a few observations
about a “cognitive system” that is distributed across the
situation.The organizationofsucha system—thefunctional
relations among its elements, and indeed the constitutive
elements themselves—would change every time the per-
son moves to a new location or begins interacting with a
different set of objects.That is, the system would retain its
identity only so long as the situation and the person’s task
orientation toward that situation did not change. Such a
system would clearly be a facultativesystem, and faculta-
tive systems like this would arise and disband rapidly and
continuouslyduringthe daily life of the individualperson.

SIX VIEWS OF EMBODIED COGNITION
631
The distributed view of cognition thus trades off the ob-
ligate nature of the system in order to buy a system that is
more or less closed.
If, on the other hand, we restrict the system to include
only the cognitive architecture of the individual mind or
brain, we are dealingwith a single,persisting,obligatesys-
tem. The variouscomponentsofthesystem’sorganization—
perceptual mechanisms,attentionalfilters, working mem-
ory stores, and so on—retain their functionalroles within
that system across time. The system is undeniably open
with respect to its environment, continuously receiving
input that affects the system’s functioning and producing
output that has consequences for the environment’s fur-
ther impact on the system itself. But, as in the case of hy-
drogen, or an ecosystem, this characteristic of openness
does not compromise the system’s status as a system.
Given this analysis,it seems clear that a strong view of dis-
tributedcognition—that a cognitivesystem cannotin prin-
ciple be taken to comprise only an individualmind—will
not hold up.
Of course we can reject this strong version of distrib-
uted cognition and still accept a weaker version, in which
studying the mind-plus-situation is considered to be a
promising supplementary avenue of investigation, in ad-
dition to studying the mind per se. Two points should be
noted, though. First, taken in this spirit, the idea of dis-
tributed cognition loses much of its radical cachet. This
view does not seek to revolutionize the field of cognitive
science, but simply adds to the list of phenomena that the
field studies.Likewise, chaos theory did not revolutionize
or overturn our understandingof physics, but simply pro-
vided an additional tool that helped to broaden the range
of phenomena that physics could characterize success-
fully. (Indeed, some examples of research on distributed
topics appear to stretch the bounds of what we would rec-
ognize as cognition at all. The study of the organized be-
havior of groups is one such example; see, e.g., Hutchins,
1995.)
Second, it remains to be seen whether, in the long run,
a distributed approach can provide deep and satisfying in-
sights into the nature of cognition.If we recall that the goal
of science is to find underlyingprinciplesand regularities,
rather than to explain specific events, then the facultative
natureofdistributedcognitionbecomesa problem.Whether
this problem can be overcome to arrive at theoretical in-
sights with explanatorypower is an issue that awaits proof.
Claim 5: Cognition Is for Action
More broadly than the stringent criteria for situated
cognition, the embodied cognition approach leads us to
consider cognitive mechanisms in terms of their function
in serving adaptive activity (see, e.g., Franklin, 1995,
chap. 16). The claim that cognitionis for actionhas gained
momentum from work in perception and memory in par-
ticular. “Vision,” accordingto Churchland,Ramachandran,
andSejnowski(1994),“has itsevolutionaryrationalerooted
in improved motor control” (p. 25; see also Ballard, 1996;
O’Regan,1992;Pessoa, Thompson,& Noë, 1998).“Mem-
ory,” as Glenberg (1997) similarly argues, “evolved in ser-
vice of perception and action in a three-dimensionalenvi-
ronment” (p. 1).
First, let us consider the case of visual perception. The
traditionalassumption has been that the purpose of the vi-
sual system is to build up an internal representation of the
perceived world. What is to be done with this representa-
tion is then the job of “higher” cognitiveareas. In keeping
with this approach, the ventral and dorsal visual pathways
in thebrain have been thoughtof as the“what” and “where”
pathways, generating representations of object structure
and spatial relationships, respectively. In the past decade,
though, it has been argued that the dorsal stream is more
properly thought of as a “how” pathway. The proposed
functionof this pathwayis to serve visuallyguided actions
such as reaching and grasping(for reviews, see Goodale&
Milner, 1992; Jeannerod, 1997).
In support of this, it has been found that certain kinds
of visual input can actually prime motor activity. For ex-
ample, seeing a rectangle of a particular orientation facil-
itates performance on a subsequent grasping task, pro-
vided that the object to be grasped shares that orientation
(Craighero,Fadiga,Umiltà, & Rizzolatti,1996).This prim-
ing occurs even when the orientationof the rectangledoes
not reliably predict the orientation of the object to be
grasped. A striking corollary is that visual input can acti-
vate covert motor representations in the absence of any
task demands. Certain motor neurons in monkeys that are
involved in controllingtool use also respond to seen tools
without any motor response on the part of the subject
(Grafton, Fadiga,Arbib, & Rizzolatti,1997;Murata et al.,
1997).Behavioraldata reported by Tuckerand Ellis(1998)
tella similarstory. When subjectsindicatewhethercommon
objects (e.g., a teapot, a frying pan) are upright or inverted,
response times are fastest when the response hand is the
same as the hand that would be used to grasp the depicted
object(e.g.,the left hand if theteapot’s handleis ontheleft).
A similar proposal has been advanced for the nature of
memory storage.Glenberg (1997)arguesthatthetraditional
approach to memory as “for memorizing” needs to be re-
placed by a view of memory as “the encoding of patterns
of possible physical interaction with a three-dimensional
world” (p. 1). Glenberg seeks to explaina variety of mem-
ory phenomenain terms of such perceptuomotorpatterns.
Short-term memory, for example, is seen not as a distinct
memory “system,” but as the deploymentof particularac-
tion skills such as those involved in verbal rehearsal. Se-
mantic memory and the formation of concepts are simi-
larly explained in terms of embodied memory patterns,
differing from episodic memory only in frequency of the
pattern’s use across many situations.
This approach to memory helps make sense of a vari-
ety of observations,formal and informal, that we concep-
tualize objects and situations in terms of their functional
relevance to us, rather than neutrally or “as they really
are.” These observations range from laboratory experi-
mentson encodingspecificityand functionalfixedness,to
the quip attributed to Maslow that when all you have is a

hammer everything looks like a nail, to the fanciful
Umwelt drawings of Uexküll (1934; reprints can be found
in Clark, 1997)showing what the environmentmight look
like to creatures with different cognitiveagendas. Our un-
derstanding of the “how” system of vision suggests how
this type of embodied memory might work. As we have
seen from the work on priming of motor activity, the vi-
sual system can engage motor functionswithout resulting
in immediate overt action. This is precisely the kind of
mechanism that would be needed to create the perceptuo-
motor patterningthat Glenberg argues comprises the con-
tents of memory.
The question we must ask, though, is how far this view
of perception, memory, and cognition in general can take
us. Can we dispense entirely with representation for rep-
resentation’s sake, neutral with respect to a specific pur-
pose or action? We need not look far for evidence suggest-
ingthatwecannot.To beginwith,althoughthe“how”system
of perceptual processing appears to be for action, the very
existence of the “what” system suggests that not all infor-
mation encodingworks this way. The ventral stream of vi-
sual processing does not appear to have the same kinds of
direct links to the motor system that the dorsal stream
does. Instead, the ventral stream goes about identifying
patterns and objects, apparently engaging in perception
for perception’s sake. This pointis driven home if we con-
sider some of the things that this system is asked to en-
code. First, there are visual events, such as sunsets, that
are always perceived at a distanceand do not offer any op-
portunity for physical interaction (cf. Slater, 1997). Sec-
ond, there are objectswhose recognitiondependson holis-
tic visual appearance, rather than on aspects of physical
structure thatoffer opportunitiesfor perceptuomotorinter-
action. Human faces are the showcase example here, al-
though the same point can be make for recognizing indi-
viduals of other categories,such as dogs or houses. Third,
there is the case of reading, where sheer visual pattern
recognition is paramount and opportunities for physical
interaction with those patterns are virtuallynil. Thus, per-
ceptualencodingcannot be accountedfor entirely in terms
of direct perception-for-actionprocessing channels.
The problems get worse when we look beyond percep-
tual processing to some of the broader functions of mem-
ory. Mental concepts, for example, do not always or even
usually follow physical concrete properties that lend
themselves to action, but instead often involve intangible
properties based on folk-scientific theories or knowledge
ofcausalhistory(see, e.g.,Keil, 1989;Putnam,1970;Rips,
1989). A classic example is that a mutilated dollar bill is
still a dollar bill, but a counterfeit dollar bill is not. Simi-
larly, cheddar cheese is understood to be a dairy product,
but soy milk, which more closely resembles milk in its
perceptual qualities and action affordances, is not.
In an ultimate sense, it must be true that cognitionis for
action. Adaptive behavior that promotes survival clearly
must have driven the evolution of our cognitive architec-
ture. The question, though, is the following: In what way
or ways does our cognitive architecture subserve action?
The answer being critiqued here is that the connectionsto
action are quite direct: Individual percepts, concepts, and
memories are “for” (or are based on) particularactionpat-
terns. The evidencediscussed above,though,suggeststhat
this is unlikely to hold true across the board. An alterna-
tive view is that cognition often subserves action via a
more indirect,flexible,and sophisticatedstrategy, in which
information about the nature of the external world is
stored for future use without strong commitmentson what
that future use might be.
In support of this, we can note that our mental concepts
often contain rich information about the properties of ob-
jects, information that can be drawn on for a variety of
uses that almost certainly were not originallyencoded for.
We are in fact capable of breaking out of functionalfixed-
ness, and do so regularly. Thus, I can notice a piano in an
unfamiliar room, and being a nonmusician, I might think
of it only as having a bench I can sit on and flat surfaces I
can set my drink on. But I can also later call up my knowl-
edge of the pianoin a variety of unforeseen circumstances:
if I need to make a loud noise to get everyone’s attention;
if the door needs to be barricaded against intruders; or if
we are caught in a blizzard without power and need to
smash up some furniture for fuel. Notice that these novel
uses can be derived from a stored representation of the
piano.They need not be triggered by direct observationof
the piano and its affordances while one is entertaining a
new action-based goal.
It is true that our mental representations are often
sketchy and incomplete, particularly for things that we
have encountered only once and briefly. The literature on
change blindness, which shows that people can entirely
miss major changes to a scene across very brief time lags,
makes this point forcefully (see Simons & Levin, 1997,
for a review). But the fact that we are limited in how much
we can attend to and absorb in a single brief encounter
does not alter the fact that we can and do build up robust
detailed representations with repeated exposure. Further-
more, it is unclear that the sketchiness of a representation
would prevent it from being a “representation for repre-
sentation’s sake.” Our mental representations, whether
novel and sketchy or familiar and detailed,appear to be to
a large extent purpose-neutral, or at least to contain infor-
mation beyond that needed for the originally conceived
purpose. And this is arguably an adaptive cognitive strat-
egy. A creature that encodes the world using more or less
veridical mental models has an enormous advantage in
problem-solving flexibility over a creature that encodes
purely in terms of presently foreseeable activities.
Claim 6: Off-Line Cognition Is Body Based
Let us return now to the kinds of externalized cognitive
activities described in Section 3, in which we manipulate
the environment to help us think about a problem. Con-
sider theexampleof countingon one’s fingers. In its fullest
form, this can be a set of crisp and large movements, un-
ambiguously setting forth the different fingers as coun-
ters. But it can also be done more subtly, differentiating

----- Page 9 (native) -----
SIX VIEWS OF EMBODIED COGNITION
633
the positionsof the fingers only enough to allowthe owner
of the fingers to keep track. To the observer, this might
look like mere twitching. Imagine, then, that we push the
activity inward still further, allowing only the priming of
motor programs but no overt movement. If this kind of
mental activity can be employed successfully to assist a
task such as counting, a new vista of cognitive strategies
opens up.
Many centralized,allegedlyabstract cognitiveactivities
may in fact make use of sensorimotor functionsin exactly
this kind of covert way. Mental structures that originally
evolved for perceptionor action appear to be co-opted and
run “off-line,” decoupled from the physical inputs and
outputsthat were their original purpose, to assist in think-
ing and knowing. (Several authors have proposed mecha-
nisms by which this decouplingmight take place:Dennett,
1995,chap. 13; Glenberg, 1997;Grush, 1996,1998;Stein,
1994.) In general, the function of these sensorimotor re-
sources is to run a simulation of some aspect of the physi-
cal world, as a means of representinginformation or draw-
ing inferences.
Althoughthis off-line aspect of embodied cognitionhas
generated less attention than situated cognition, evidence
in its favor has been mounting quietly for many years.
Sensorimotorsimulationsof external situationsare in fact
widely implicated in human cognition.
Mental imagery. Imagery, includingnot onlythe well-
studied case of visual imagery but also those of auditory
imagery (Reisberg, 1992) and kinesthetic imagery (Par-
sons et al., 1995), is an obvious example of mentally sim-
ulating external events. It is a commentary on the histori-
cal strength of the nonembodied viewpoint, then, that
during the 1980s the study of imagery was dominated by
a debate over whether images were in fact image-like in
any meaningful sense. An elaborate defense had to be
mounted to show that imagery involves analogue repre-
sentations that functionally preserve spatial and other
properties of the external world, rather than consisting of
bundlesof propositions(see Kosslyn, 1994, for a review).
Today, this issue has been firmly resolved in favor of the
analogue nature of images, and evidence continues to
mount for a close connection between imagery, which
takes place in the absence of relevantexternalstimulation,
and the machineryof ordinary perception(see, e.g., Farah,
1995; Kosslyn, Pascual-Leone, Felician, & Camposano,
1999).
Working memory. A second example of simulating
physical events through the off-line use of sensorimotor
resources is short-term memory. Early models referred
abstractly to “items” maintained temporarily in memory.
Baddeley and Hitch (1974; Baddeley, 1986), however,
built a persuasive case for a multicomponent working
memory system that had separate storage componentsfor
verbal and for visuospatial information, each of which
was coded and maintained in something resembling its
surface form. The particulars of the Baddeley model have
been challenged on a variety of grounds, but, as I have ar-
gued elsewhere, some version of a sensorimotor model
appears to be the only viable way to account for the large
body of data on working memory (Wilson, 2001a). Early
evidence for the sensorimotor nature of working memory
includedeffects of phonologicalsimilarity(worse memory
for words thatsoundalike),word length(worse memory for
long words), and articulatorysuppression (worse memory
when the relevant articulatorymuscles are kept busy with
anotheractivitysuch as repeatinga nonsenseword). More
recently, a similar set of effects, but in a different sensori-
motor modality, has been found for working memory for
sign language in deaf subjects: Performance drops when
to-be-remembered signs have similar hand shapes or are
temporally long,or when subjectsare required to perform a
repetitivemovementwith theirhands(Wilson & Emmorey,
1997, 1998). Furthermore, research on patient popula-
tions and brain imaging of normals indicates the involve-
ment of speech perceptionand speech productionareas of
the brain in working memory rehearsal (see Wilson,
2001a,for a review). Thus, working memory appears to be
an example of a kind of symbolic off-loading, similar in
spirit to that discussed in Section 3. However, instead of
off-loading all the way out into the environment, working
memory off-loads information onto perceptual and motor
control systems in the brain.
Episodic memory. Long-term memory, too, is tied in
certain ways to our bodies’ experiences with the world.
The point is most obviousin the case of episodicmemory.
Whetheror not one positsa separate episodicmemory sys-
tem, episodicmemories are a class of memories defined by
their content—they consistof records of spatiotemporally
localized events, as experienced by the rememberer. Phe-
nomenologically, recalling an episodic memory has a
quality of “reliving,” with all the attendant visual, kines-
thetic, and spatial impressions. This is especially true
when memories are fresh, before they have become crys-
tallized by retelling into something more resembling se-
mantic memories.
Implicit memory. Implicit memory also appears to be
an embodied form of knowledge, consisting of a kind of
perceptual and/or procedural fluency (see, e.g., Cohen,
Eichenbaum, Deacedo, & Corkin, 1985; Johnston, Dark,
& Jacoby, 1985). Implicit memory is the means by which
we learn skills, automatizingwhat was formerly effortful.
Viewed in this light,implicitmemory can be seen as a way
of taking off line some of the problems that confront the
situatedcognizer. I notedearlier thatwhen humansare con-
fronted with novel complex tasks under time pressure, the
representational bottleneck comes into play and perfor-
mance suffers. With practice, though, new skills become
automatized, reducing cognitive load and circumventing
the representational bottleneck.(See Epelboim, 1997, for
evidencethat automatizinga task reduces the need for off-
loadingwork onto the environment.)In effect, prior expe-
rience allows whatever representations are necessary for
task performance to be built up before the fact. This strat-
egy involves exploitingpredictabilityin the task situation
being automatized—hence the fact that tasks with consis-
tent mapping between stimulus and response can be au-

----- Page 10 (native) -----

tomatized,but tasks with varied mapping cannot (Schnei-
der & Shiffrin, 1977).
Viewing automaticityas a way of tacklingthe represen-
tational bottleneck ahead of time can help explain one of
the apparent paradoxes of automaticity. Traditionally,
automaticprocessinghas beenconsideredthepolaropposite
of controlled processing (Schneider & Shiffrin, 1977;
Shiffrin & Schneider,1977); yet highly automatizedtasks
appear to allow greater opportunityfor fine-tuned control
of action, as well as more robust and stable internal repre-
sentations of the situation (cf. Uleman & Bargh, 1989).
Compare, for example,a novicedriver and an expert driver
making a left turn, or a novice juggler and an expert jug-
gler trying to keep three balls in the air. In each case, the
degree of control over the details of the behavior is quite
poorfor the novice,and the phenomenologicalexperience
of the situation may be close to chaos. For the expert, in
contrast, there is a sense of leisure and clarity, as well as a
high degree of behavioral control. These aspects of auto-
matic behavior become less mysterious if we consider the
process of automatizingas one of buildingup internalrep-
resentations of a situation that contains certain regulari-
ties, thus circumventing the representational bottleneck.
Reasoningand problem-solving. There is considerable
evidence that reasoning and problem-solvingmake heavy
use of sensorimotor simulation. Mental models, partic-
ularly spatial ones, generally improve problem-solving
relative to abstract approaches. A classic example is the
Buddhist monk problem: prove that a monk climbing a
mountain from sunrise to sunset one day and descending
the next day must be at some particular point on the path
at exactly the same time on both days. The problem be-
comes trivial if one imagines the two days superimposed
on one another. One instantly “sees” that the ascending
monk and the descending monk must pass one another
somewhere. Other examples of spatial models assisting
reasoning and problem-solving abound in undergraduate
cognitive psychology textbooks. Furthermore, recent
work by Glenberg and colleagues explores how the con-
struction of mental models may occur routinely, outside
the context of formal problem-solving, in tasks such as
text comprehension (Glenberg & Robertson, 1999, 2000;
Kaschak & Glenberg, 2000; see also commentaries on
Glenberg & Robertson, 1999: Barsalou, 1999a; Ohlsson,
1999; Zwaan, 1999).
The domains of cognitionlisted aboveare all well estab-
lished and noncontroversial examples of off-line embodi-
ment. Collectively, they suggest that there are a wide vari-
ety of ways in which sensory and motoric resources may be
used for off-line cognitiveactivity. In accord with this, there
are alsoa numberof currentareas ofresearch exploringfur-
ther ways in which off-line cognition may be embodied.
For example, the field of cognitivelinguisticsis reexam-
ining linguistic processing in terms of broader principles
of cognitive and sensorimotor processing. This approach,
in radical contrast to the formal and abstract syntactic
structures of traditional theories, posits that syntax is
deeply tied to semantics (e.g., Langacker, 1987, 1991;
Talmy, 2000; see Tomasello, 1998, for a review). Of par-
ticular interest for the present purpose, this linkage be-
tween syntaxand semantics rests in part on image schemas
representing embodied knowledge of the physical world.
These image schemas make use of perceptual principles
such as attentionalfocus and figure/ground segregationin
order to encode grammatical relations between items
within the image schema.
A second example is an embodied approach to explain-
ing mental concepts. We saw earlier that there are prob-
lems with trying to explain concepts as direct sensori-
motor patterns. Nevertheless, it is possible that mental
concepts may be built up out of cognitive primitives that
are themselves sensorimotor in nature. Along these lines,
Barsalou (1999b) has proposed that perceptual symbol
systems are used to build up concepts out of simpler com-
ponents that are symbolic and yet at the same time modal.
For example, the concept chair, rather than comprising
abstract, arbitrary, representationsof the componentsof a
chair (back, legs, seat), may instead comprise modal rep-
resentationsof each of these componentsand their mutual
relations,preservinganaloguepropertiesof the thingbeing
represented. Whereas this example is quite concrete, the
inclusion of introspection as one of the modalities helps
support the modal representation of concepts that we
might think of as more abstract, such as feelings (e.g.,
hungry) and mental activities (e.g., compare).
A slightly different approach to abstract concepts is
taken by Lakoff and Johnson and others, who argue that
mental conceptsare deeply metaphorical,based on a kind
of second-order modeling of the physical world and rely-
ing on analogiesbetween abstract domainsand more con-
crete ones (e.g., Gibbs, Bogdanovich, Sykes, & Barr,
1997; Lakoff & Johnson, 1980, 1999). As one example,
consider the concept communication. The internal struc-
ture of this concept is deeply parallel to our physical un-
derstanding of how material can be transferred from one
container to another. The parallels include metaphorical
movement of thoughts across space from one person’s
head to another, metaphorical barriers preventing suc-
cessfultransfer(as whensomeoneisbeing“thick-headed”),
and so on. According to this view, our mental representa-
tion of communication is grounded in our knowledge of
how the transfer of physicalstuff works. Thus, even highly
abstract mental concepts may be rooted, albeit in an indi-
rect way, in sensory and motoric knowledge.
A third example is the role that motoric simulationmay
play in representing and understanding the behavior of
conspecifics. Consider the special case of mentally simu-
lating something that is imitatible—that can be mapped
isomorphically onto one’s own body. Such stimuli in fact
primarilyconsistof our fellow humans.There are goodrea-
sons to believe that this isomorphism provides a special
foothold for robust and noneffortful modeling of the be-
havior of other people (see Wilson, 2001b, for review).
Given that we are a highly social species, the importance of
such modeling for purposes of imitating,predicting,or un-
derstanding others’ behavior is potentiallyquite profound.

SIX VIEWS OF EMBODIED COGNITION
635
We need not commit ourselves to all of these proposals
in their present form in order to note that there is a general
trend in progress. Areas of human cognition previously
thoughtto be highly abstract now appear to be yielding to
an embodied cognition approach. With such a range of
arenas where mental simulation of external events may
play a role, it appears that off-line embodied cognition is
a widespread phenomenon in the human mind. The time
may have come when we must consider these not as iso-
lated pieces of theoretical advancement, but as reflecting
a very general underlying principle of cognition.
Conclusions
Rather than continue to treat embodied cognition as a
single viewpoint,we need to treat the specific claims that
have been advanced, each according to its own merits.
One benefit of greater specificity is the ability to distin-
guish on-line aspects of embodied cognitionfrom off-line
aspects. The former include the arenas of cognitive activ-
ity that are embedded in a task-relevant external situation,
including cases that may involve time pressure and may
involve off-loading information or cognitive work onto
the environment. In these cases, the mind can be seen as
operating to serve the needs of a body interacting with a
real-world situation. There is much to be learned about
these traditionally neglected domains, but we should be
cautious about claims that these principles can be scaled
up to explain all of cognition.
Off-line aspects of embodied cognition,in contrast, in-
clude any cognitiveactivitiesin which sensory and motor
resources are brought to bear on mental tasks whose ref-
erents are distant in time and space or are altogetherimag-
inary. These include symbolicoff-loading,where external
resources are used to assist in the mental representation
and manipulationof things that are not present, as well as
purely internal uses of sensorimotor representations, in
the form of mental simulations.In these cases, rather than
the mind operating to serve the body, we find the body (or
its controlsystems) serving the mind. This takeoverby the
mind, and the concomitant ability to mentally represent
what is distant in time or space, may have been one of the
driving forces behind the runaway train of human intelli-
gence that separated us from other hominids.
