Steganography is the science that involves communicating secret data in an appropriate
multimedia carrier, e.g., image, audio, and video ﬁles. It comes under the assumption
that if the feature is visible, the point of attack is evident, thus the goal here is always to
conceal the very existence of the embedded data. Steganography has various useful
applications. However, like any other science it can be used for ill intentions. It has been
propelled to the forefront of current security techniques by the remarkable growth in
computational power, the increase in security awareness by, e.g., individuals, groups,
agencies, government and through intellectual pursuit. Steganography’s ultimate
objectives, which are undetectability, robustness (resistance to various image proces-
sing methods and compression) and capacity of the hidden data, are the main factors
that separate it from related techniques such as watermarking and cryptography. This
paper provides a state-of-the-art review and analysis of the different existing methods
of steganography along with some common standards and guidelines drawn from the
literature. This paper concludes with some recommendations and advocates for the
object-oriented embedding mechanism. Steganalysis, which is the science of attacking
steganography, is not the focus of this survey but nonetheless will be brieﬂy discussed.

1. Introduction
The standard and concept of ‘‘What You See Is What
You Get (WYSIWYG)’’ which we encounter sometimes
while printing images or other materials, is no longer
precise and would not fool a steganographer as it does not
always hold true. Images can be more than what we see
with our Human Visual System (HVS); hence, they can
convey more than merely 1000 words.
For
decades
people
strove
to
develop
innovative
methods for secret communication. The remainder of this
introduction highlights brieﬂy some historical facts and
attacks on methods (also known as steganalysis). A
thorough history of steganography can be found in the
literature [1–3].
Three
techniques
are
interlinked,
steganography,
watermarking and cryptography. The ﬁrst two are quite
difﬁcult to tease apart especially for those coming from
different disciplines. Fig. 1 and Table 1 may eradicate such
confusion. The work presented here revolves around
steganography in digital images and does not discuss
other types of steganography (such as linguistic or audio).

communities. The term ‘‘cover image’’ will be used
throughout this paper to describe the image designated

image with embedded data, called herein payload, as
‘‘stego-image’’. Further ‘‘steganalysis’’ or ‘‘attacks’’ refer to
different image processing and statistical analysis ap-
proaches that aim to break or attack steganography
algorithms (Fig. 2).
1.2. Ancient steganography
The word steganography is originally derived from
Greek words which mean ‘‘Covered Writing’’. It has
been used in various forms for thousands of years. In the
5th century BC Histaiacus shaved a slave’s head, tattooed
a message on his skull and the slave was dispatched
with the message after his hair grew back [1–4]. In Saudi
Arabia
at
the
King
Abdulaziz
City
of
science
and
technology, a project was initiated to translate into
English
some
ancient
Arabic
manuscripts
on
secret
writing which are believed to have been written 1200
years ago. Some of these manuscripts were found in
Turkey and Germany [5]. Five hundred years ago, the
Italian mathematician Jerˆome Cardan reinvented a Chi-
nese ancient method of secret writing. The scenario goes
as follows: a paper mask with holes is shared among two
parties, this mask is placed over a blank paper and the
sender writes his secret message through the holes then
takes the mask off and ﬁlls the blanks so that the message
appears
as an
innocuous
text as
shown
in
Fig.
3.
This method is credited to Cardan and is called Cardan
Grille [4].
It was also reported that the Nazis invented several
steganographic methods during World War II such as
Microdots, and have reused invisible ink and null ciphers.
As an example of the latter a message was sent by a Nazi
spy that read: ‘‘Apparently neutral’s protest is thoroughly
discounted and ignored. Isman hard hit. Blockade issue
affects pretext for embargo on by-products, ejecting suets
and vegetable oils.’’ Using the 2nd letter from each word
the secret message reveals: ‘‘Pershing sails from NY June
1’’ [2,6,7].
In 1945, Morse code was concealed in a drawing (see
Fig. 4). The hidden information is encoded onto the stretch
of grass alongside the river. The long grass denoted a line
and the short grass denoted a point. The decoded message
read: ‘‘Compliments of CPSA MA to our chief Col Harold R.
Shaw on his visit to San Antonio May 11th 1945’’ [8].
1.3. The digital era of steganography
With the boost in computer power, the internet
and with the development of digital signal processing
(DSP), information theory and coding theory, steganogra-
phy has gone ‘‘digital’’. In the realm of this digital world
steganography has created an atmosphere of corporate
vigilance that has spawned various interesting applica-
tions, thus its continuing evolution is guaranteed. Con-
temporary information hiding is due to [9]. One of the
earliest methods to discuss digital steganography is
credited to Kurak and McHugh [10], who proposed a
method which resembles embedding into the 4 LSBs (least
signiﬁcant bits). They examined image downgrading and
contamination which is known now as image-based
steganography.
Cyber-crime is believed to beneﬁt from this digital
revolution. Hence an immediate concern was shown on
the possible use of steganography by terrorists following a

report in USA TODAY.1 Cyber-planning or the ‘‘digital
menace’’ as Lieutenant Colonel Timothy L. Thomas deﬁned
it, is difﬁcult to control [11]. Provos and Honeyman [3], at
the University of Michigan, scrutinized three million
images from popular websites looking for any trace of
steganography. They have not found a single hidden
message. Despite the fact that they attributed several
reasons to this failure it should be noted that stegano-
graphy does not exist merely in still images. Embedding
hidden messages in video and audio ﬁles is also possible.
Examples exist in [12] for hiding data in music ﬁles, and
even in a simpler form such as in Hyper Text Mark up
Language (HTML), executable ﬁles (.EXE) and Extensible
Markup Language (XML) [13]. This shows that USA
TODAY’s claim is not supported by a strong evidence,
especially knowing that the writer of the above report
resigned about two years later after editors determined
that he had deceived them during the course of their
investigation.2
This paper’s focus is on the review of steganography in
digital images. For a detailed survey on steganographic
tools
in
other
media
from
a
forensic
investigator’s
perspective the reader is referred to [14].
Section 2 brieﬂy discusses the applications of stegano-
graphy. Methods available in the literature are described
in Section 3. The main discussions and comparisons focus
on spatial domain methods, frequency domain methods
and also adaptive methods in digital images. It will be
shown
that
most
of
the
steganographic
algorithms
discussed have been detected by steganalysis algorithms
and thus a more robust approach needs to be developed
and investigated. Section 4 will give a brief analysis and
set it in context. Section 5 will discuss in brief the
counterfeiting of steganography, a science known as
steganalysis. A conclusion is provided in Section 6.
2. Steganography applications
Steganography is employed in various useful applica-
tions, e.g., copyright control of materials, enhancing
robustness
of
image
search
engines
and
smart
IDs
(identity cards) where individuals’ details are embedded
in their photographs. Other applications are video–audio
synchronization, companies’ safe circulation of secret
data, TV broadcasting, TCP/IP packets (for instance a
unique ID can be embedded into an image to analyze the
network trafﬁc of particular users) [1], and also checksum
embedding
[15].
Petitcolas
[16]
demonstrated
some
contemporary applications, one of which was in Medical
Imaging
Systems
where
a
separation
is
considered
necessary for conﬁdentiality between patients’ image
data or DNA sequences and their captions, e.g., physician,
patient’s name, address and other particulars. A link
however, must be maintained between the two. Thus,
embedding the patient’s information in the image could
be a useful safety measure and helps in solving such
problems. Steganography would provide an ultimate
guarantee of authentication that no other security tool
may ensure. Miaou et al. [17] present an LSB embedding
technique for electronic patient records based on bi-polar
multiple-base
data
hiding.
A
pixel
value
difference
between an original image and its JPEG version is taken
to be a number conversion base. Nirinjan and Anand [18]
and Li et al. [19] also discuss patient data concealment in
digital images.
Inspired by the notion that steganography can be
embedded as part of the normal printing process, the
Japanese ﬁrm Fujitsu3 is developing technology to encode
data into a printed picture that is invisible to the human
eye (data), but can be decoded by a mobile phone with a
camera as exempliﬁed in Fig. 5a and shown in action in
Fig. 5b. The process takes less than one second as the
embedded data is merely 12 bytes. Hence, users will be
able to use their cellular phones to capture encoded data.

They charge a small fee for the use of their decoding
software which sits on the ﬁrm’s own servers. The basic
idea is to transform the image colour scheme prior to
printing to its hue, saturation and value components
(HSV), then embed into the Hue domain to which human
eyes are not sensitive. Mobile cameras can see the coded
data and retrieve it. This application can be used for
‘‘doctor’s
prescriptions,
food
wrappers,
billboards,
business cards and printed media such as magazines
and pamphlets’’ [20], or to replace barcodes.
The conﬁdence in the integrity of visual imagery has
been ruined by contemporary digital technology [21]. This
led to further research pertaining to digital document
forensics. As an example, Cheddad et al. [22] proposed a
security scheme which protects scanned documents from
forgery using self-embedding techniques. The method not

only points out forgery but also allows legal or forensics
experts to gain access to the original document despite
being manipulated (as can be seen from Fig. 6).
3. Steganography methods
This section attempts to give an overview of the most
important steganographic techniques in digital images.
The most popular image formats on the internet are
graphics interchange format (GIF), Joint Photographic
Experts Group (JPEG), and to a lesser extent—the portable
network graphics (PNG). Most of the techniques devel-
oped were set up to exploit the structures of these formats
with some exceptions in the literature that use the bitmap
format (BMP) for its simple data structure.
We
deﬁne
the
process
of
embedding
as
follows
(a graphical representation is shown in Fig. 7):
Let C denote the cover carrier, i.e., image A, and C0 the
stego-image. Let K represent an optional key (a seed used
to encrypt the message or to generate a pseudorandom
noise which can be set to {|} for simplicity) and let M be
the message we want to communicate, i.e., image B. Em is
an acronym for embedding and Ex for Extraction. There-
fore:
Em : C  K  M-C0
ð1Þ
‘ExðEmðc; k; mÞÞ  m; 8c 2 C; k 2 K; m 2 M
ð2Þ
We will ﬁrst discuss brieﬂy some methods which
exploit image formats. Then we will examine some of the
dominant techniques bearing in mind that the most
popular survey available on steganographic techniques
was published ten years ago [23]. An evaluation of
different spatial steganographic techniques applied espe-
cially to GIF images is also available [24].
In reference to the survey of Johnson et al. [23]:
 This paper is purely dedicated to steganography in
image ﬁles (the most widespread research area) unlike
in Johnson et al. who discuss in: Section 3.2.8 (Unused
or reserved space in computer systems), Section 3.3.2
(Hiding information in digital sound), Section 3.3.3
(Echo hiding), Section 3.6.1 (Encoding information in
formatted
text),
Section
3.7.1
(Mimics
functions),
Section 3.7.2 (Automated generation of English texts).
 Since the publication of Johnson et al. work, stegano-
graphy has evolved dramatically. Therefore, an up-to-
date survey was deemed necessary. In Johnson et al.
work, the latest cited paper was published in 1999,
which means their survey is now 10 years old.
 This paper’s recommendations and method analysis
can distinguish this initiative from that of Johnson
et al. [23].
 The survey of Johnson et al. [23] appeared in the
‘‘Information hiding’’ book, which limits its distribu-
tion (i.e., cost matters especially for young researchers)
compared to a Journal paper which can be more
affordable.
 The classiﬁcation, herein, of the techniques and that of
Johnson et al. are different. Johnson et al. classify
steganography techniques into: Substitution systems,
transform domain techniques, spread spectrum tech-
niques, statistical methods, distortion techniques, and
cover generation methods.
 Johnson et al.’s survey neither talks about the history
of steganography nor its applications (unlike this
survey).
 Johnson et al.’s work has not included test images that
can allow readers visualize the concepts.
In reference to the survey of Bailey and Curran [24]:
 The authors evaluate in their work some software that
is
applied
in
the
spatial
domain;
mainly
those
supporting GIF formats (see Bailey and Curran [24,
p. 62]). However, they did not discuss or evaluate the
frequency
domain
software/methods
and
did
not
criticise the core algorithms.
 In Bailey and Curran’s work, published three years ago,
the latest cited paper was published in 2001. That
means their survey, in fact, is 8 years old.
 They
apply
perceptual
evaluation
using
a
direct
comparison between the original and stego-image
ﬁles. Steganography assumes the unavailability of the
original image.
 Their survey concludes the evaluation without recom-
mendations or enhancements.
Section 3.2 discusses spatial domain techniques which
generally uses a direct least signiﬁcant bit (LSB) replace-
ment technique. Section 3.3 discusses the frequency
domain based methods such as discrete cosine transform
(DCT), Fourier transform (FT) and discrete wavelet trans-
form (DWT). Finally, the third sub-section will highlight
the recent contribution in the domain which is termed
perceptual masking (PM) or adaptive steganography (AS).

The categorization of steganographic algorithms into the
three
categories,
namely,
spatial
domain,
frequency
domain and adaptive methods, is unique to this work
and there is no claim that it is a standard categorization.
Adaptive methods can either be applied in the spatial or
frequency domains; as such they are regarded as special
cases.
We
opt
not
to
include
image-format
based
steganography here as it is a naı¨ve implementation and
extremely prone to detection.
3.1. Steganography exploiting the image format
Steganography can be accomplished by simply feeding
into a Windows OS command window, e.g., Windows XP)
the following code: C:4 Copy Cover.jpg /b þ Message.
txt /b Stego.jpg
What this code does is that it appends the secret
message found in the text ﬁle ‘‘Message.txt’’ into the JPEG
image ﬁle ‘‘Cover.jpg’’ and produces the stego-image
‘‘Stego.jpg’’. The idea behind this is to abuse the recogni-
tion of EOF (End of ﬁle). In other words, the message is
packed and inserted after the EOF tag. When Stego.jpg is
viewed using any photo editing application, the latter will
just display the picture ignoring anything coming after the
EOF tag. However, when opened in Notepad for example,
our message reveals itself after displaying some data as
shown in Fig. 8. The embedded message does not impair
the image quality. Neither image histograms nor visual
perception can detect any difference between the two
images due to the secret message being hidden after the
EOF tag. Whilst this method is simple, a range of
steganography
software
distributed
online
uses
it
(Camouﬂage, JpegX, Data Stash [25]). Unfortunately, this
simple technique would not resist any kind of editing to
the stego-image nor any attacks by steganalysis experts.
Another naı¨ve implementation of steganography is to
append
hidden
data
into
the
image’s
extended
ﬁle
information (EXIF), which is a standard used by digital
camera manufacturers to store information in the image
ﬁle, such as, the make and model of a camera, the time the
picture was taken and digitized, the resolution of the
image, exposure time, and the focal length. This is
metadata information about the image and its source
located at the header of the ﬁle. Special agent Paul Alvarez
[26] discussed the possibility of using such headers in
digital evidence analysis to combat child pornography.
Fig. 9 depicts some text inserted into the comment ﬁeld of
a GIF image header. This method is not a reliable one as it
suffers from the same drawbacks as that of the EOF

method. Note that it is not always recommended to hide
data directly without encrypting as in this example.
3.2. Steganography in the image spatial domain
In spatial domain methods a steganographer modiﬁes
the secret data and the cover medium in the spatial
domain, which involves encoding at the level of the LSBs.
This method although simpler, has a larger impact
compared to the other two types of methods [26].
A general framework showing the underlying concept
is highlighted in Fig. 10. A practical example of embedding
in the 1st LSB and up to the 4th LSB is illustrated in Fig. 11.
It can be seen that embedding in the 4th LSB generates
more visual distortion to the cover image as the hidden
information is seen as ‘‘non-natural’’.
It is apparent to an observer that Fig. 11 concludes that
there is a trade-off between the payload and the cover
image distortion; however the payload, (embedding up to
the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th LSB) is analogous with respect to
the recovered embedded image. For instance, Fig. 11(k)
(recovered from embedding into 4 LSBs) is a good
estimate of the hidden image (Fig. 11(c)) but produces
noticeable
artefacts
(Fig. 11(f)).
On
the
other
hand
(Fig. 11(j)) (recovered from embedding into 1st LSB) trades
bad quality with an almost identical carrier to the original
(compare Fig. 11(d) with Fig. 11(a)).
Potdar et al. [27] used a spatial domain technique in
producing a ﬁngerprinted secret sharing steganography
for robustness against image cropping attacks. Their paper
addressed the issue of image cropping effects rather than
proposing an embedding technique. The logic behind their
proposed work is to divide the cover image into sub-
images and compress and encrypt the secret data. The
resulting data is then sub-divided in turn and embedded
into those image portions. To recover the data, a Lagrange
Interpolating Polynomial was applied along with an
encryption algorithm. The computational load was high,
but their algorithm parameters, namely the number of
sub-images (n) and the threshold value (k) were not set to
optimal values leaving the reader to guess the values. Bear
in mind also that if n is set to 32, for example, that means
32 public keys are needed along with 32 persons and 32
sub-images, which turns out to be unpractical. Moreover,
data redundancy that they intended to eliminate does
occur in their stego-image.
Shirali-Shahreza and Shirali-Shahreza [28] exploited
Arabic and Persian alphabet punctuations to hide mes-
sages. While their method is not related to the LSB
approach, it falls into the spatial domain if the text is
treated as an image. Unlike the English which has only
two letters with dots in their lower case format, namely
‘‘i’’ and ‘‘j’’, Persian language is rich in that 18 out of 32
alphabet letters have dots. The secret message is binarized
and those 18 letters’ dots are modiﬁed according to the
values in the binary ﬁle.
Colour
palette
based
steganography
exploits
the
smooth ramp transition in colours as indicated in the
colour palette. The LSBs here are modiﬁed based on their
positions in the palette index. Johnson and Jajodia [1]
were in favour of using BMP (24 bit) instead of JPEG
images. Their next-best choice was GIF ﬁles (256-color).
BMP as well as GIF based steganography apply LSB
techniques, while their resistance to statistical counter-
attacks
and
compression
are
reported
to
be
weak
[3,29–32]. BMP ﬁles are bigger compared to other formats
which render them improper for network transmissions.
JPEG images however, were at the beginning avoided
because of their compression algorithm which does not
support a direct LSB embedding into the spatial domain.
In [33], the authors claimed that changes as small as
ﬂipping the LSB of one pixel in a JPEG image can be
reliably detected. The experiments on the discrete cosine
transform (DCT) coefﬁcients showed promising results
and redirected researchers’ attention towards this type of
image. In fact acting at the level of DCT makes stegano-
graphy more robust and less prone to statistical attacks.
Jung and Yoo [34] down-sampled an input image to 1
2 of
its size and then used a modiﬁed interpolation method,
termed the neighbour mean interpolation (NMI), to up-
sample the result back to its original dimensions ready for

embedding. For the embedding process the up-sampled
image was divided into 2  2 non-overlapping blocks as
shown in Fig. 12. Potential problems with this method are:

errors, owing to the use of log2, which is also used in
the extraction that produces ﬂoating point values, and

Histogram-based data hiding is another commonly used
data hiding scheme. Li et al. [35] propose lossless data
hiding using the difference value of adjacent pixels. It is
classiﬁed under ‘‘71’’ data embedding algorithms. It
exploits the correlation between adjacent pixels that

shown in Fig. 13). Instead of considering the whole image,
Piyu Tsai et al. [36] divide the image into blocks of 5  5
where the residual image is calculated using linear
prediction (another term for adjacent pixels’ difference).
Then the secret data is embedded into the residual values,
followed by block reconstruction.
Such schemes have the advantage of recovering the
original cover image from the stego-image. While this
preservation can be required in certain applications such
as medical imaging, in general steganography is not
concerned with such recovery. The hiding capacity is
restricted in these methods, besides the ‘‘71’’ embedding
strategy can be detected (see for example Cancelli et al.
[37]).
3.3. Steganography in the image frequency domain
New algorithms keep emerging prompted by the
performance of their ancestors (spatial domain methods),
by the rapid development of information technology and
by the need for an enhanced security system. The
discovery of the LSB embedding mechanism is actually a
big achievement. Although it is perfect in not deceiving
the HVS, its weak resistance to attacks left researchers
wondering where to apply it next until they successfully
applied it within the frequency domain.

input image F and an output image T is calculated as:

respectively.
DCT is used extensively with video and image compres-
sion e.g. JPEG lossy compression. Each block DCT coefﬁcients
obtained from Eq. (3) are quantized using a speciﬁc
quantization table (QT). This matrix shown in Fig. 14 is
suggested in the Annex of the JPEG standard, note that some
camera manufacturers have their own built-in QT and they
do not necessarily conform to the standard JPEG table. The
logic behind choosing a table with such values is based on
extensive experimentation that tried to balance the trade-off
between image compression and quality factors. The HVS
dictates the ratios between values in the QT.
The aim of quantization is to loosen up the tightened
precision produced by DCT while retaining the valuable
information descriptors. The quantization step is speciﬁed
by:

denotes the result function, fðox;oyÞ is an 8  8 non-
overlapping intensity image block and b:c a ﬂoor rounding
operator. Gðox;oyÞ represents a quantization step which,
in relationship to JPEG quality, is given by:

where QTðox;oyÞ is the quantization table depicted in
Fig. 14 and Q is a quality factor. JPEG compression then
applies entropy coding such as the Huffman algorithm to
compress the resulted Gðox;oyÞ. Most of the redundant
data and noise are lost in this stage hence the name lossy
compression. For more details on JPEG compression the
reader is directed to Popescu’s work [38].
The above scenario is a discrete theory independent of
steganography. Li and Wang [39] presented a stegano-
graphic method that modiﬁes the QT and inserts the
hidden bits in the middle frequency coefﬁcients. Their
modiﬁed QT is shown in Fig. 15. The new version of the QT
gives them 36 coefﬁcients in each 8  8 block to embed
their secret data into which yields a reasonable payload.
Their work was motivated by a prior published work [40].
Steganography based on DCT JPEG compression goes
through different steps as shown in Fig. 16.
Most of the techniques here use JPEG images as
vehicles to embed their data. JPEG compression uses the
DCT to transform successive sub-image blocks (8  8
pixels) into 64 DCT coefﬁcients. Data is inserted into
these coefﬁcients’ insigniﬁcant bits; however, altering any
single coefﬁcient would affect the entire 64 block pixels
[41]. As the change is operating on the frequency domain

----- Page 11 (native) -----
instead of the spatial domain there will be no visible
change in the cover image given those coefﬁcients are
handled with care [42].
According to Raja et al. [43] fast Fourier transform
(FFT) methods introduce round-off errors; thus it is not
suitable for hidden communication. However, Johnson
and Jajodia [1], thought differently and included it among
the used transformations in steganography and McKeon
[44] utilised the 2D discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to
generate Fourier based steganography in movies.
Choosing which values in the 8  8 DCT coefﬁcients
block are altered is very important as changing one value
will affect the whole 8  8 block in the image. Fig. 17
shows a poor implementation of such a method in which
careful consideration was not given to the sensitivity of
DCT coefﬁcients.

The JSteg algorithm was among the ﬁrst algorithms to
use JPEG images. Although the algorithm stood strongly
against visual attacks, it was found that examining the
statistical distribution of the DCT coefﬁcients shows the
existence of hidden data [3]. JSteg is easily detected using
the X2-test. Moreover, since the DCT coefﬁcients need to
be treated with sensitive care and intelligence the JSteg
algorithm leaves a signiﬁcant statistical signature. Wayner
[45] stated that the coefﬁcients in JPEG compression
normally fall along a bell curve and the hidden informa-
tion embedded by JSteg distorts this. Manikopoulos et al.
[46] discussed an algorithm that utilises the probability
density function (PDF) to generate discriminator features
fed into a neural network system which detects hidden
data in this domain.
OutGuess [3] was a better alternative as it used a
pseudo-random-number generator to select DCT coefﬁ-
cients. The X2-test does not detect data that is randomly
distributed. The developer of OutGuess suggests a coun-
ter-attack against his algorithm. Provos et al. [3,47,48]
suggest applying an extended version of the X2-test to
select Pseudo-randomly embedded messages in JPEG
images.
Andreas Westfeld based his ‘‘F5’’ algorithm [49] on
subtraction and matrix encoding (also known as syn-
drome coding). F5 embeds only into non-zero AC DCT
coefﬁcients by decreasing the absolute value of the
coefﬁcient by 1. A shrinkage occurs, as described in [50],
when the same bit has to be re-embedded in case the
original coefﬁcient is either ‘‘1’’ or ‘‘1’’ as at the decoding
phase all zero coefﬁcients will be skipped whether they
were modiﬁed or not. Neither X2-test nor its extended
versions could break this solid algorithm. Unfortunately,
F5 did not survive attacks for too long. Fridrich et al. [33]
proposed
steganalysis that
does
detect F5
contents,
disrupting F5’s survival.
Another trend related to the above quantization table
modiﬁcation (Fig. 15) is the so-called perturbed quantiza-
tion (PQ) [51], which aims to achieve high efﬁciency, with
minimal distortion, rather than a large capacity. Each
coefﬁcient in the DCT block is assigned a scalar value that
corresponds to how much impact it would make to the
carrier image, and then a steganographer can set a
selection rule to ﬁlter out the ‘‘well behaved’’ coefﬁcients,
thus giving the algorithm less payload but high imper-
ceptibility.
As for steganography in the discrete wavelet transform
(DWT), the reader is directed to some examples in the
literature [52–54]. Abdulaziz and Pang [55] use vector
quantization called Linde-Buzo-Gray (LBG) coupled with
block codes known as BCH code and 1-stage discrete Haar
wavelet transforms. They reafﬁrm that modifying data
using a wavelet transformation preserves good quality
with little perceptual artefacts.
The DWT-based embedding technique is still in its
infancy. Paulson [56] reports that a group of scientists at
Iowa State University are focusing on the development of
an innovative application which they call ‘‘Artiﬁcial Neural
Network Technology for steganography (ANNTS)’’ aimed
at detecting all present steganography techniques includ-
ing DCT, DWT and DFT. The inverse discrete Fourier
transform (iDFT) encompasses round-off error which
renders DFT improper for steganography applications.
Abdelwahab and Hassan [57] propose a data hiding
technique in the DWT domain. Both secret and cover
images are decomposed using DWT (1st level). Each of

which is divided into disjoint 4  4 blocks. Blocks of the
secret image ﬁt into the cover blocks to determine the
best match. Afterwards, error blocks are generated and
embedded into coefﬁcients of the best matched blocks in
the HL of the cover image. Two keys must be commu-
nicated; one holds the indices to the matched blocks in
the
CLL (cover approximation)
and another for
the
matched blocks in the CHL of the cover. Note that the
extracted payload is not totally identical to the embedded
version as the only embedded and extracted bits belong to
the secret image approximation while setting all the data
in other sub-images to zeros during the reconstruction
process.
3.4. Adaptive steganography
Adaptive steganography is a special case of the two
former methods. It is also known as ‘‘Statistics-aware
embedding’’ [3], ‘‘Masking’’ [1] or ‘‘Model-Based’’ [58].
This method takes statistical global features of the image
before attempting to interact with its LSB/DCT coefﬁ-
cients. The statistics will dictate where to make the
changes [59,60]. It is characterized by a random adaptive
selection of pixels depending on the cover image and the
selection of pixels in a block with large local STD
(standard deviation). The latter is meant to avoid areas
of uniform colour (smooth areas). This behaviour makes
adaptive steganography seek images with existing or
deliberately added noise and images that demonstrate
colour complexity. Wayner [45] dedicated a complete
chapter in a book to what he called ‘‘life in noise’’, pointing
to the usefulness of data embedding in noise. It is proven
to be robust with respect to compression, cropping and
image processing [41,61,62]. The model-based method
(MB1), described in [58], generates a stego-image based
on a given distribution model, using a generalized Cauchy
distribution, that results in the minimum distortion.
Due to the lack of a perfect model, this steganographic
algorithm can be broken using the ﬁrst-order statistics
[63]. Moreover, it can also be detected by the difference
of ‘‘blockiness’’ between a stego-image and its estimated
image
reliably
[64].
The
discovery
of
‘‘blockiness’’
led the author in [58] to produce an enhanced version
called MB2, a model-based with de-blocking. Unfortu-
nately, even MB2 can be attacked as highlighted in
Section 5.
Edge embedding follows edge segment locations of
objects in the host gray scale image in a ﬁxed block fashion
each of which has its centre on an edge pixel. Whilst simple,
this method is robust to many attacks and it follows that this
adaptive method is also an excellent means of hiding data
while maintaining a good perceptibility.
Chin-Chen et al. [65], propose an adaptive technique
applied to the LSB substitution method. Their idea is to
exploit the correlation between neighbouring pixels to
estimate the degree of smoothness. They discuss the
choices
of
having
2–4
sided
matches.
The
payload
(embedding capacity) was high.
Hioki [66], presented an adaptive method termed ‘‘A
Block
Complexity
based
Data
Embedding’’
(ABCDE).
Embedding is performed by replacing selected suitable
pixel data of noisy blocks in an image with another noisy
block obtained by converting data to be embedded. This
suitability is identiﬁed by two complexity measures to
properly discriminate complex blocks from simple ones;
which are run-length irregularity and border noisiness
(see Fig. 18). The hidden message is more a part of the
image than being added noise [67]. The ABCDE method
introduced a large embedding capacity; however, certain
control parameters had to be conﬁgured manually, e.g.,
ﬁnding an appropriate section length for sectioning a
stream of resource blocks and ﬁnding the threshold value
that controls identiﬁcation of complex blocks. These
requirements
render
the
method
unsuitable
for
automatic processes. Table 2 shows the parameters that
the algorithm encompasses. To get rid of fake complex

blocks resulting from considering an adjacent pure binary
code (PBC), Hioki chooses to convert decimals into
reﬂected binary gray code (RBGC). The problem which
RBGC was used to solve was the complexity of the higher
bit planes to tolerate little relation to the true variation of
the image pixels’ intensities creating what is often called
‘‘hamming cliffs’’ [68].
There are two vague issues which are obscurely
discussed
at
the
end
of
Hioki’s
work.
One
arises
when the carrier image’s dimensions are not proportional
to the block division scheme and so fragments from
these dimensions are kept away from the embedding
process. There was no indication by the author of the
possible impact of this decision as it might leave a clear
contrast between the modiﬁed and the intact parts of the
image which distorts its statistical properties. The second
point is the introduction of the zero padding when the
compressed resource ﬁle size is not a multiple of the
block size. The author did not show any explanation on
how to generate complexity from such a compressed
ﬁle since there will be a sequence of zeros resulting from
the ‘‘0’’ padding notion. The author in the experimental
section does not show how resilient the algorithm is to
different image processing attacks, e.g., rotation, additive
noise, cropping, and compression. Indeed, the ABCDE
algorithm
provides
an
improvement
over
a
former
method known as BPCS (bit plane complexity segmenta-
tion) [69]; which, in turn, was introduced to compensate
for the drawback of the traditional LSB manipulation
techniques of data hiding [70]. The computational com-
plexity of the algorithm to ﬁnd a phase key that passes
the threshold is time consuming and there is no guarantee
that it will always evolve into an optimal solution [71].
BPCS steganography is not robust to even small changes
in the image [72], and this weakness is inherited by the
ABCDE algorithm also since its underlying framework is
based on BPCS. This intolerance to any manipulation of
the stego-image is perceived by the authors in [72] as a
merit. They were over-optimistic about this lack of
robustness in the sense that any kind of attack would
‘‘destroy the embedded evidence’’ which points, in their
view, to image tampering. Robustness of steganography is
one of the three main goals to be achieved and this is
deﬁnitely not shown in Kawaguchi’s argument. Their
algorithm would fail to retrieve the embedded data in two
cases: ﬁrst when the stego-image is attacked resulting in
the destruction of the embedded data, and second when
an image is plain clear (meaning that no embedding
process took place). These two contradictory justiﬁca-
tions, due primarily to lack of robustness, would not be
appealing characteristics to forensics experts or other
interested bodies.
In [67], the authors chose to use wavelet transforms
that map integers to integers instead of using the
conventional wavelet Transforms. This can overcome the
difﬁculty of ﬂoating point conversion that occurs after
embedding. Their scheme embeds the payload in non
overlapping 4  4 blocks of the low frequency, where two
pixels at a time are chosen, one on either side of the
principal diagonal. Cover image adjustment was required
to prevent the problem of under/overﬂow of pixel values
after embedding. In the respective section, they discuss
the overﬂow problem only, where they suggest using the
following system prior to embedding:
C0ði; j; kÞ ¼
Cði; j; kÞ  ð2N  1Þ
if Cði; j; kÞ ¼ 255
Cði; j; kÞ
Otherwise:
(
ð6Þ
where C0(i, j, k) denotes the modiﬁed pixel and N
represents the number of bits to be embedded in each
coefﬁcient (i.e., N=4). This means any value of 255 will be
converted to 240. For a true colour image format, they
apply the algorithm on each colour plane separately. This
step ignores the high correlation between colour planes in
natural images. Not taking this phenomenon into con-
sideration means the embedding scenario will corrupt
some of the inherited statistics of the cover image, a trap
that severely exposes the stego-image to steganalysis
attacks. The authors also state some assumptions; ﬁrst,
embedding is carried out only on non-singular matrices,
also 715 is imperceptible to human vision; ﬁnally, the
cover image and payload are assumed to be JPEG and
the cover be a square matrix of size 512  512. We doubt
the second assertion however. Even though this can be
possibly acceptable from a human visual perspective,
however, from a statistical point of view, this amount of
change is intolerable. Before they conclude, they state that
their cover image and stego-image version are similar,
even though the best candidate in their experiments has a
PSNR that did not exceed 45.
In [73], the authors attempt to create a method to
restore the marked image to its pristine state after
extracting the embedded data. They achieve this by
applying the pick point of a histogram in the difference
image to generate an inverse transformation in the spatial
domain. The cover image is divided into non-overlapping
4  4 blocks where a difference matrix of size 3  4 is
generated for each block. The selection of the local
histogram’s peak point pb will direct the embedding
process and matrix manipulation. The example shown in
their hiding phase section might not be sufﬁcient to verify
the accuracy of the algorithm. Some questions remain
unanswered such as what happens when we have two
peak points instead of one? On which criterion will we
base our selection? Another issue occurs when transform-
ing the matrix SDb to RDb; it is highly likely that after the
subtraction process we will have some values that collude
with the peak value which confuses the extraction of the
embedded data. To prevent over/underﬂow, caused by the
arithmetic operations on values close to boundaries (i.e.,
0, 255), the authors use the modulus operator (i.e., mod
256). There was no adequate explanation on the effect
of homogeneous, dark, bright, and edged blocks on the
algorithm efﬁciency.
In [74], a GA-based algorithm is presented which
generates a stego-image to break the detection of the
spatial domain and the frequency-domain steganalysis
systems by artiﬁcially counterfeiting statistical features.
Time complexity, which is usually the drawback of genetic
based algorithms, was not discussed though. They men-
tioned that ‘‘the process is repeated until a predeﬁned
condition is satisﬁed or a constant number of iterations

are reached. The predeﬁned condition is the situation
when
we
can
correctly
extract
the
desired
hidden
message.’’ Again, it was not stated whether the process
of determining such a condition was done automatically
or involved a human inference (visual perception). The
suggested GA-based rounding-error correction algorithm,
whilst interesting, still needs proof of generalization. Wu
and Shih [74] closed their introduction section by saying,
‘‘this is the ﬁrst paper of utilizing the evolutionary
algorithms in the ﬁeld of steganographic systems’’. It
should be noted that image hiding using genetic algorithm
was known prior to their work such as the work in [75].
In [64], the authors proposed extending the conventio-
nal
‘‘71’’
algorithm
to
JPEG
images
using
genetic
algorithm.
Kong et al. [76] proposed a content-based image
embedding based on segmenting homogenous grayscale
areas using a watershed method coupled with Fuzzy
C-Means (FCM). Entropy was then calculated for each
region. Entropy values dictated the embedding strength
where four LSBs of each of the cover’s RGB primaries were
used if it exceeded a speciﬁc threshold otherwise only two
LSBs for each were used. The drawback of this method was
its sensitivity to intensity changes which would affect
severely the extraction of the correct secret bits. As a side
note, Kong et al. [76] also reported the use of a logistic
map to encrypt the secret bit stream which seems
venerable to a Chosen-plaintext attack (CPA).
Chao et al. [77] presented a 3D steganography scheme.
The embedding scheme hides secret messages in the
vertices of 3D polygon models. Similarly, Bogomjakov et
al. [78], hide a message in the indexed representation of a
mesh by permuting the order in which faces and vertices
are stored. Although, such methods claim higher embed-
ding capacity, however time complexity to generate the
mesh and then rendering can be an issue. Moreover 3D
graphics are not that portable compared to digital images.
Nakamura and Zhao [79], propose a morphing process
that takes as input the secret image and the cover ﬁle. The
method does not discuss the generated features from the
cover and secret images used for morphing and how to
regenerate them from the stego-image.
Zeki and Azizah [80] proposed what they termed as
‘‘the intermediate signiﬁcant bit algorithm’’. They studied
different ranges of an 8 bit image and found the best
compromise for distortion and robustness was in the
following range: [0:15] [16:31] y [224:239] [240:255].
The core idea in the embedding process is to ﬁnd the
nearest range that matches the secret bit in the next or
previous range.
4. Analysis and recommendations
As a performance measurement for image distortion,
the well known peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) which is
classiﬁed under the difference distortion metrics can be
applied on the stego-images. It is deﬁned as:
PSNR ¼ 10 log10 C2
max
MSE


ð7Þ
where MSE denotes mean square error which is given as:
MSE ¼
1
MN
X
M
x¼1
X
N
y¼1
ðSxy  CxyÞ2
ð8Þ
where x and y are the image coordinates, M and N are the
dimensions of the image, Sxy is the generated stego-image
and Cxy is the cover image. Also C2
max holds the maximum
value in the image, for example:
C2
maxr
1;
double-precision
255;
uint8 bit
(
Many authors [39,42,81–84], consider Cmax=255 as a
default value for 8 bit images. It can be the case, for
instance, that the examined image has only up to 253 or
fewer representations of gray colours. Knowing that Cmax
is raised to a power of 2 results in a severe change to the
PSNR value. Thus Cmax can be deﬁned as the actual
maximum value rather than the largest possible value.
PSNR is often expressed on a logarithmic scale in decibels
(dB). PSNR values falling below 30 dB indicate a fairly low
quality, i.e., distortion caused by embedding can be
obvious; however, a high quality stego-image should
strive for 40 dB and above.
Van Der Weken et al. [85] proposed other similarity
measures (SMs). They analysed the efﬁciency of ten SMs in
addition to a modiﬁed version of PSNR constructed based
on neighbourhood blocks which better adapt to human
perception. In
order
to produce

comparison between different methods of invisible water-
marking, Kutter and Petitcolas [86] discussed a novel
measure adapted to the human visual system.

method
described in Section 3.2 [25], applied on the images
shown in Figs. 19–22 (which depict the output of each of
the tools).
It is also noted that some algorithms, like the one used
in the Revelation software, have the pair effect ﬁngerprint
that appears on stego-images.
Table 4 compares some software tools appearing in
[25]. We based our comparison on the following factors:
 the domain on which the algorithm is applied, e.g.,
spatial or frequency domain,
 the support for encryption,
 random bit selection and
 the different supported image formats.
A performance analysis of some steganographic tools is
provided in [59]. The drawback of the current techniques
is tabulated in Table 5.
There appears to be two main groups in the area, one
for creating steganography algorithms and another group
for creating a counter-attack (steganalysis). Fard et al. [41]
state clearly that ‘‘there is currently no steganography
system which can resist all steganalysis attacks’’. ‘‘Ulti-
mately, image understanding is important for secure
adaptive steganography. A human can easily recognize
that a pixel is actually a dot above the letter ‘‘i’’ and must
not be changed. However, it would be very hard to write a

computer program capable of making such intelligent
decisions in all possible cases, [70]’’. ‘‘While there are
numerous techniques for embedding large quantities of
data in images, there is no known technique for embed-
ding this data in a manner that is robust in light of the
variety of manipulations that may occur during image
manipulation’’ [15].
‘‘Some
researchers
proposed
to
model
the
cover
characteristics and thus create an adaptive steganography
algorithm, a goal which is not easily achieved’’ [87].
Determining the
maximal safe
bit-rate that can be
embedded in a given image without introducing statistical
artifacts remains a very complicated task [88]. The above
challenges motivated the steganography community to
create a more fundamental approach based on universal
properties and adaptive measures [89].
In the table, the sign (|) indicates the characteristic is
present, () denotes unavailability of information at
present, while (  ) gives the negative response. As it is
clear from the table, all of the mentioned steganographic
algorithms have been detected by steganalysis methods
and thus a robust algorithm with a high embedding
capacity needs to be investigated.
Based on the literature the following points are noted:
 Algorithms F5 and Outguess are the most reliable
although they violate the second order statistics. Both
utilise DCT embedding.
 Embedding in the DWT domain shows promising
results and outperforms DCT embedding especially in
terms of compression survival [45]. A steganographer
should be cautious when embedding in the transfor-
mation domains in general; however DWT tends to be
more ﬂexible than DCT. Unlike JPEG, the introduced
image coding system JPEG20004 allows wavelets to be
employed for compression in lieu of the DCT. This makes
DWT based steganography the future leading method.
 Without loss of generality; edge embedding maintains
an excellent distortion free output whether it is applied
in the spatial, DCT or DWT domains [90]. However, the
limited payload is its downfall.
Recognising and tracking elements in a given carrier
while embedding can help survive major image proces-
sing attacks and compression. This manifests itself as an
adaptive intelligent type where the embedding process
affects only certain regions of interest (ROI) rather than
the entire image. With the boost of computer vision (CV)
and pattern recognition disciplines this method can be
fully automated and unsupervised. These elements (ROIs),
e.g., faces in a crowd [91], can be adjusted in perfectly
undetectable ways. The majority of steganography re-
search to date has overlooked the fact that utilising
objects within images can strengthen the embedding
robustness—with few exceptions. A steganography ap-
proach reported in [92,93], incorporated computer vision
to track and segment skin regions for embedding under
the assumption that skin tone colour provides better
embedding imperceptibility. They used computer vision
techniques to introduce their rotation and translation
invariance embedding scheme to establish an object
oriented embedding (OOE). A related method, in the sense
that it uses objects in images although it is meant for
watermarking instead, was introduced by authors in
[94,95] where they employed an adaptive clustering
technique in order to derive a robust region representa-
tion of the original image. The robust regions were
approximated by ellipsoids, whose bounding rectangles
were chosen as the embedding area for the watermark.
Most of the existing steganographic methods rely on
two factors: the secret key and the robustness of the
steganographic algorithm. However, all of them either do
not address the issue of encryption of the payload prior to
embedding or merely give a hint of using one or more of
the conventional block cipher algorithms. Hence, Westfeld
et al. concluded their CRYSTAL project with an important
observation that ‘‘Crypto–Stego interaction is not very
well researched, yet’’.5 Authors of [96,97] are among those

who discuss in details the encryption of the payload prior
to embedding.
There are some basic notes that should be observed by
a steganographer:
 In order to eliminate the attack of comparing the
original image ﬁle with the stego-image, where a very
simple kind of steganalysis is essential, we can freshly
create an image and destroy it after generating the
stego-image. Embedding into images available on the
World Wide Web is not advisable as a steganalysis
devotee might notice and opportunistically utilize
them to decode the stego-image.
 In order to avoid any Human Visual Perceptual attack,
the
generated
stego-image
must
not
have
visual
artifacts. Alteration made up to the 4th LSB of a given
pixel will yield a dramatic change in its value. Such
unwise choice on the part of the steganographer will
thwart the perceptual security of the transmission.
Consider the following example: let a pixel intensity
value be 173, which in binary is (10101101)2. If the
secret bit is ‘‘0’’ then the stego-image pixel will be 165
((10100101)2 in binary) or 172 ((10101100)2 in binary).
 Smooth homogeneous areas must be avoided, e.g.,
cloudless blue sky over a blanket of snow; however
chaotic areas with naturally redundant noisy back-
grounds and salient rigid edges should be targeted
[23,98]. This point, however, needs further investiga-
tion as some authors think differently. An example is
the study of Kodovsky and Fridrich [99] that concludes
‘‘texture-adaptive selection channels do not improve
steganographic security’’.
 The secret data must be a composite of a balanced bit
values, since in general, the expected probabilities of
bit 0 and bit 1 for a typical cover image are the same
(i.e.,
Probabilityf0g ¼ Probabilityf1g ¼ 0:5)
[100].
In
some cases, encryption provides such a balance.
It is essential that encryption not only is able to offer
such a balance but also is random enough so that it can
mimic the LSBs of the cover image. Even though Wayner
[45, p. 26] has answered the question ‘‘how random is the
noise?’’ qualitatively there are various methods which
estimate randomness quantitatively (see [101]). One way
to measure such randomness is to use Cross-Covariance as
illustrated in Fig. 23.
The last LSB where the stego-value, compared to the
plain-value, is unchanged, increased or decreased by one
(change by 71 in the 1st LSB or 74 in the 3rd LSB)
eventually leaves traceable statistical violations. Many
algorithms to date still use such conventional models
either in the spatial domain or the transform domain.
The RBGC allows alteration to even the third LSB (i.e.,
change by 73) in the DWT without much degradation
compared to the conventional use of PBC, see Fig. 24 for
the graphical structure of both methods. Let a plain-image
pixel at the approximation level of a 1st level DWT
be the coefﬁcient C and let the secret bit be ‘‘0’’:
C=325.09821988712 (Fig. 25).

5. Steganalysis
This article does not delve into the details of the methods
of steganalysis although this work presents, herein, a brief
description and some standards that a steganographer
should usually examine. Steganalysis is the science of
attacking steganography in a battle that never ends. It
mimics the already established science of Cryptanalysis.
Note that steganographers can create a steganalysis system
merely to test the strength of their algorithm. Steganalysis is
achieved
through
applying
different
image
processing
techniques, e.g., image ﬁltering, rotating, cropping, and
translating. More deliberately, it can be achieved by coding
a program that examines the stego-image structure and
measures its statistical properties, e.g., ﬁrst order statistics
(histograms) or second order statistics (correlations between
pixels, distance, direction). JPEG double compression and the
distribution of DCT (discrete cosine transform) coefﬁcients
can give hints on the use of DCT-based image steganography.
Passive steganalysis attempts to destroy any trace of secret
communication, without bother to detect the secrete data,
by using the above mentioned image processing techniques:
changing the image format, ﬂipping all LSBs or by under-
taking
a
severe
lossy
compression,
e.g.,
JPEG.
Active
steganalysis however, is any specialized algorithm that
detects the existence of stego-images.
Spatial steganography generates unusual patterns such
as
sorting
of
colour
palettes,
relationships
between
indexed colours and exaggerated ‘‘noise’’, as can seen in
Fig. 26, all of which leave traces to be picked up by
steganalysis tools. This method is very fragile [102]. ‘‘LSB
encoding is extremely sensitive to any kind of ﬁltering or
manipulation
of
the
stego-image.
Scaling,
rotation,
cropping, addition of noise, or lossy compression to the
stego-image
is
very
likely
to
destroy
the
message.
Furthermore an attacker can easily remove the message
by removing (zeroing) the entire LSB plane with very little
change in the perceptual quality of the modiﬁed stego-
image’’ [29]. Almost any ﬁltering process will alter the
values of many of the LSBs [103].
By inspecting the inner structure of the LSBs, Fridrich
and her colleagues [105] claimed to be able to extract
hidden messages as short as 0.03 bpp (bit per pixel).
Xiangwei et al. [32] stated that the LSB methods can
result in the ‘‘pair effect’’ in the image histograms. As
can be seen in Fig. 27, this ‘‘pair effect’’ phenomenon is
empirically observed in steganography based on the
modulus operator. Note that it is not always the case
that modulus steganography produces such noticeable
phenomenon.
This
operator
acts
as
a
means
to
generate
random
locations
(i.e.
not
sequential)
to
embed data. It can be a complicated process or a simple

is even then embed, otherwise do nothing). Avcibas

The previous histogram is given by the following
discrete function:
HðkiÞ ¼

255
i¼0
gðkiÞ
ð9Þ
where ki is the ith intensity level in the interval {0, 255}
and g(ki) is the number of pixels in the image whose
intensity level is ki. It is the nature of standard intensity
image histograms to track and graph frequencies of pixel
values in a given image and not their structure and how
they are arranged, see Fig. 28.
Chi-square (w2) and Pair-analysis algorithms can easily
attack methods based on the spatial domain. Chi-square is
a
non-parametric
(a
rough
estimate
of
conﬁdence)
statistical algorithm used in order to detect whether the
intensity levels scatter in a uniform distribution through-
out the image surface or not [107]. If one intensity level
has been detected as such, then the pixels associated with
this intensity level are considered as corrupted pixels or in
this case have a higher probability of having embedded
data. The classical Chi-square algorithm can be fooled by
randomly embedded messages, thus Bohne and Westfeld
[108] developed a steganalysis method to detect randomly
scattered hidden data in the LSB spatial domain that
applies the preserving statistical properties (PSP) algo-
rithm.
If oi ¼ fo1; o2; . . . ; ong denote the observed data, this can
be seen as the number of times the symbols 1, 0 occur in
the image LSBs [45, p. 311]. Let ei be the number of times
the event is expected to occur. Then the test statistic is of
the form:
w2 ¼
X ðoi  eiÞ2
ei
ð10Þ
To avoid detection during steganalysis attacks, Fu and Au
[109] and Guo (in watermarking) [110] proposed data hiding
methods for halftone images. The assumption set here is
that the inverse halftoning process would smooth the noise
occurring from data embedding. However, inspired by the
steganalysis techniques for gray level images, Cheng and Kot
[111] successfully created a system able to counter-attack
such methods by exploiting the wavelet statistic features
extracted from the reconstructed gray level image through
the inverse halftoning of a given halftone image fed into the
support vector machine’s classiﬁer.
Jessica and Goljan [112] propose a statistical method
that uses higher-order statistics called RS steganalysis; it
is designed to provide an estimated percentage of ﬂipped
pixels caused by embedding as can be seen from Table 6
generated from Fig. 29.
Cancelli et al. [37] reveal that the performance of
current state-of-the-art steganalysis algorithms for detec-
tion of 71 steganography is highly sensitive to the used
training and testing databases. Their experiments also
show that the examined algorithms are not applicable in
their current state since the embedding rate for testing is
very likely to be unknown, while it was assumed otherwise
in those algorithms. Therefore, they conclude that no single
steganalysis algorithm is constantly superior.

In the frequency domain, Pevny and Jessica [113]
developed a multi-class JPEG steganalysis system that
comprised of DCT features and calibrated Markov features,
which were then merged to produce a 274-dimensional
feature vector. This vector is fed into a Support Vector
Machine multi-classiﬁer capable of detecting the presence
of model-based steganography, F5, OutGuess, Steghide
and JP Hide&Seek. Li et al. [114] exposed some of the
weaknesses in ‘‘YASS’’ algorithm [115] by noticing that it
introduces extra zero coefﬁcients into the embedded
host
blocks
because
of
the
use
of
a
quantization
index modulation (QIM) method and by contrasting
statistical features derived from different blocks in the
stego-image.
Targeted
embedding
methods,
such
as
the
new
enhanced MB2, are faced with much more accurate
targeted attacks. That is because ‘‘if the selection channel
is public, the attacker can focus on areas that were likely
modiﬁed and use those less likely to have been modiﬁed
for comparison/calibration purposes’’ [116, p. 6]. In [117],
Ullerich and Westfeld, successfully attacked MB2 using
coefﬁcient types that are derived from the blockiness
adjustment of MB2. They adapt Sallee’s Cauchy model
itself to detect Cauchy model-based embedded messages.
In [118], Chen and Shi, attacked MB2 and other JPEG-based
algorithms using Markov process (MP) that exploits the
intra-block
and
inter-block
correlations
among
JPEG
coefﬁcients.

6. Conclusions and summary
This paper presented a background discussion on the
major algorithms of steganography deployed in digital
imaging. The emerging techniques such as DCT, DWT and
adaptive steganography are not too prone to attacks,
especially when the hidden message is small. This is
because they alter coefﬁcients in the transform domain,
thus image distortion is kept to a minimum. Generally
these methods tend to have a lower payload compared to
spatial domain algorithms. There are different ways to
reduce the bits needed to encode a hidden message.
Apparent methods can be compression or correlated
steganography, as proposed by Zheng and Cox [119],
which is based on the conditional entropy of the message
given the cover. In short, there has always been a trade-off
between robustness and payload.
Scholars differ about the importance of robustness in
steganography
system
design.
In
[120],
Cox
regards
steganography as a process that should not consider
robustness as it is then difﬁcult to differentiate from
watermarking. Katzenbeisser, on the other hand, dedi-
cated a sub-section to robust steganography. He men-
tioned that robustness is a practical requirement for a
steganography system. ‘‘Many steganography systems are
designed to be robust against a speciﬁc class of mapping.’’
[87, p. 32]. It is also rational to create an undetectable
steganography algorithm that is capable of resisting
common image processing manipulations that might
occur by accident and not necessarily via an attack. Cox’s
view is formed based on his deﬁnition of steganography
and its scope, while Katzenbeisser is looking at the
process of steganography in a different way, preferring
to view it as a robust secret communication mechanism.
Steganography urges that the cover image must be
carefully selected. A familiar image should not be used, it
is better for steganographers to create their own images
[121]. This paper offered some guidelines and recommen-
dations on the design of a steganographic system.
Steganography methods usually struggle with achieving
a high embedding rate. As an alternative channel to images,
video ﬁles have many excellent features for information
hiding such as large capacity and good imperceptibility. The
challenge, however, is to be able to embed into a group of
images which are highly inter-correlated and often manipu-
lated in a compressed form [122].
This
paper
also
discusses
with
some
detail
the
differences between steganography and watermarking.
The various non-oblivious watermarking techniques avail-
able, which are highly resilient to image processing and
geometric attacks, aim to detect the presence of a
watermark using a correlation with an original template
except in the rare watermarking blind detection scenario
such as the work in [123]. This resilience can be seen for
instance in the invariance proposed in the work of Deng et
al. [124–126]. However, in steganography, this detection is
not required as the aim is to correctly extract the hidden
bits without the availability of any side information such
as the original image and watermark.
Questions arise, such as whether child pornography
exists inside seemingly innocent image or audio ﬁles? Are

criminals transmitting their secret messages in such a
way? Are anti-virus systems fooled each time by secret
embedding? The answers are still not trivial. However,
what is evident is that steganography can have some
useful applications, and like other technologies (i.e.,
encryption) it can be misused. These applications are
numerous. For example, applying intelligent restricted
content-based image retrieval (CBIR) [127], other avenues
were highlighted in Section 2.
