Nanostructured Materials
Overview
 This overview highlights very recent 
achievements and new trends in one of 
the most active and developing ﬁ elds in 
modern materials science: the produc-
tion of bulk ultraﬁ ne-grained (UFG) 
materials using severe plastic deforma-
tion (SPD). The article also summarizes 
the chronology of early work in SPD pro-
cessing and presents clear and deﬁ nitive 
descriptions of the terminology currently 
in use in this research area. Special 
attention is given to the principles of 
the various SPD processing techniques 
as well as the major structural features 
and unique properties of bulk UFG 
materials that underlie their prospects 
for widespread practical utilization.
INTRODUCTION
 Interest in the processing of bulk 
ultraﬁ ne-grained materials through the 
application of severe plastic deformation 
has grown signiﬁ cantly over the last 
decade.1–3 However, this research has 
developed so rapidly in recent years that 
the meanings of the terminology within 
this subsection of materials science have 
remained poorly deﬁ ned. It is appropri-
ate, therefore, to take this opportunity to 
ﬁ rst formally deﬁ ne two terms widely 
used within the ﬁ eld: ultraﬁ ne-grained 
(UFG) materials and severe plastic 
deformation (SPD).
 With reference to the characteristics of 
polycrystalline materials, UFG materials 
may be deﬁ ned as polycrystals having 
very small grains with average grain 
sizes less than ~1 μm. Thus, the grain 
sizes of UFG materials lie within the 
submicrometer (100–1,000 nm) and 
nanometer (less than 100 nm) ranges. For 
bulk UFG materials, there are additional 
requirements of fairly homogeneous and 
reasonably equiaxed microstructures, 
with a majority of the grain boundaries 
having high angles of misorientation.

and Yuntian T. Zhu
In practice, the presence of a large frac-
tion of high-angle grain boundaries is 
important in order to achieve advanced 
and unique properties.4
 Processing by SPD refers to vari-
ous experimental procedures of metal 
forming that may be used to impose 
very high strains on materials leading to 
exceptional grain reﬁ nement. A unique 
feature of SPD processing is that the high 
strain is imposed without any signiﬁ cant 
change in the overall dimensions of 
the workpiece. Another feature is that 
the shape is retained by using special 
tool geometries that prevent free ﬂ ow 
of the material and thereby produce a 
signiﬁ cant hydrostatic pressure. The 
presence of this hydrostatic pressure is 
essential for achieving high strains and 
introducing the high densities of lattice 
defects  necessary for exceptional grain 
reﬁ nement. 
 The principles of SPD processing 
are demonstrated in such techniques as 
high-pressure torsion (HPT), twist extru-
sion (TE), and multi-directional forging 
(MDF), where the initial dimensions of 
the samples are reasonably retained. 
However, SPD processing excludes more 
conventional forming operations such 
as uniaxial tension and compression, 
unidirectional extrusion, rolling, or draw-
ing even if these procedures include the 
imposition of fairly severe strains. The 
application of SPD processing permits 
the relatively easy fabrication of bulk 
UFG materials having typically more 
than ~1,000 grains in any direction within 
the sample volume. Ultraﬁ ne-grained 
materials produced in this way have 
submicrometer grain structures and are 
generally designated nanoSPD materi-
als. 
 Numerous techniques for SPD pro-
cessing are now available. The major 
methods already established for the 
fabrication of UFG materials are HPT, 
TE,  MDF,  equal-channel angular press-
ing (ECAP), accumulative roll-bonding 
(ARB), cyclic extrusion and compression 
(CEC), and repetitive corrugation and 
straightening (RCS). The principles of 
these various processes are outlined in 
this paper, as well as the major structural 
features and unique properties of bulk 
UFG materials, the areas of current inter-
est, and new trends within this research 
ﬁ eld. See the sidebar on page 34 for 
details on the terminology used in SPD 
processing.

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE TERMINOLOGY USED 
IN SPD PROCESSING
 The early publications dealing with the production of bulk ultraﬁ ne-grained (UFG) 
materials by severe plastic deformation (SPD) processing appeared in the western litera-
ture in the early 1990s, although there were also several contemporaneous publications 
appearing in Russian journals. At that early stage, the main interest was devoted primar-
ily to examining the unusual microstructures and properties of these materials rather than 
the precise signiﬁ cance of the SPD processing. The ﬁ rst paper in this area5 received rela-
tively little attention but a later report,6 which provided clear evidence for UFG structure 
formation by SPD, became a classic publication and is currently listed with more than 
300 separate citations. This early paper attempted also to identify similarities and differ-
ences between the grain boundaries in SPD-produced UFG materials and in the conven-
tional nanocrystalline solids fabricated by consolidation procedures such as inert gas 
condensation. At that time, the terminology in use was “intensive plastic deformation.” 
 The term “severe plastic deformation” was ﬁ rst introduced in a short paper describing 
the deformation of an Al-4% Cu-0.5% Zr alloy using high-pressure torsion,7 but the term 
became widely recognized in the ﬁ eld when it was subsequently used in an overview 
describing the structure and properties of UFG metals processed through SPD.8 This lat-
ter paper also received very extensive attention and is now listed with more than 400 cita-
tions.
 The samples produced in this way were reasonably deﬁ ned as bulk samples because 
typically they had 1,000 or more grains in any direction. An important consideration was 
also the creation of a homogeneous UFG microstructure throughout the bulk sample so 
that the processed solids consisted of reasonably equiaxed grains separated by predomi-
nantly high-angle grain boundaries. Initially, these structures were designated “submi-
crometer-grained structures” since the grain sizes were typically on the order of a few 
hundreds of nanometers but later x-ray studies revealed domain sizes on the order of 
~40–50 nm associated with localized distortions of the crystalline lattice and substruc-
ture. This led to the introduction of the term “bulk nanostructured materials.”9
 The formal deﬁ nitions used for these various terms are as follows:
 • Processing by SPD deformation: Any method of metal forming under an extensive 
hydrostatic pressure that may be used to impose a very high strain on a bulk solid 
without the introduction of any signiﬁ cant change in the overall dimensions of the 
sample and having the ability to produce exceptional grain reﬁ nement.
 • Bulk UFG materials: Bulk materials having fairly homogeneous and equiaxed mi-
crostructures with average grain sizes less than ~1 μm and with a majority of bound-
aries having large angles of misorientation.
 Through the use of processing by SPD, it is possible to produce bulk nanostructured 
materials with internal domains, dislocation cells, or other structural features within the 
grains having dimensions less than 100 nm.
through a die constrained within a chan-
nel which is bent at an abrupt angle. A 
shear strain is introduced when the billet 
passes through the point of intersection 
of the two parts of the channel. Since 
the cross-sectional dimensions of the 
billet remain unchanged, the pressings 
may be repeated to attain exceptionally 
high strains. The equivalent strain, ε, 
introduced in ECAP is determined by 
a relationship incorporating the angle 
between the two parts of the channel, Φ, 
and the angle representing the outer arc 
of curvature where the two parts of the 
channel intersect, Ψ. The relationship is 
given by:11
   ε =(N/√3)[2cot{(Φ/2)+(Ψ/2)}
      +Ψcosec{(Φ/2)+(Ψ/2)}] 
(1)
where N is the number of passes through 
the die.
 During repetitive pressings, the shear 
strain is accumulated in the billet, lead-
ing ultimately to a UFG structure. In 
practice, different slip systems may be 
introduced by rotating the billet about 
its longitudinal axis between each pass12 
and this leads to four basic processing 
routes: there is no rotation of the billet 
in route A, rotations by 90° in alternate 
directions or the same direction in routes 
BA and BC, respectively, and rotations by 
180° in route C.13 When using a die with 
a channel angle of Φ = 90°, route BC is 
generally the most expeditious way to 
develop a UFG structure consisting of 
homogeneous and equiaxed grains with 
grain boundaries having high angles of 
misorientation.
 There have also been numerous recent 
modiﬁ cations of conventional ECAP that 
are designed to yield more efﬁ cient grain 
reﬁ nement including the incorporation 
of a back-pressure, the development of 
continuous processing by ECAP, and 
others.
High-Pressure Torsion
 High-pressure torsion refers to pro-
cessing in which the sample, generally 
in the form of a thin disk, is subjected to 
torsional straining under a high hydro-
static pressure: the principle of HPT is 
illustrated schematically in Figure 2a.14 
The disk is located within a cavity, a 
hydrostatic pressure is applied, and 
plastic torsional straining is achieved by 
rotation of one of the anvils. In order to 
achieve pressures higher than 2 GPa, it 
is generally preferable to use a modiﬁ ed 
geometry with the cavities placed in each 
of the two anvils, as shown in Figure 
2b.15,16 If there is no outward ﬂ ow of mate-
rial, the disk thickness remains constant 
and the true torsional strain, γ, is given by 
γ = (r/h)ϕ, where r is the distance from 
the center of the disk, ϕ is the torsional 
angle in radians, and h is the sample 
thickness. An alternative relationship is 
also available if there is some outward 
ﬂ ow of material between the two anvils 
and a corresponding reduction in the 
value of h.14 For comparison with other 
SPD methods, the true equivalent strain, 
ε, can be calculated using the relation ε = 
(1/a) γ, where the coefﬁ cient a takes either 
the values from a plastic ﬂ ow criterion 
(where a = 2 for Tresca and a = √3 for 
von Mises) or from the Taylor theory for 
polycrystals (where a = 1.65 for texture-
free face-centered cubic [fcc] metals and 
decreases slightly to lower values during 
continued deformation). The relatively 
small disks used in conventional HPT 
are attractive for products such as small 
bulk nanomagnets with enhanced soft 
and hard magnetic properties, arterial 
stents, and devices for microelectrome-
chanical system applications. There have 
also been recent attempts to extend HPT 
to include the processing of larger bulk 
samples.17 
Accumulative Roll-Bonding 
 The technique of accumulative roll-
bonding makes use of a conventional 
rolling facility. As illustrated in Figure 
3,18 a sheet is rolled so that the thickness 
is reduced to one-half of the thickness in 
a pre-rolled condition. The rolled sheet is 
then cut into two halves that are stacked 
together. To achieve good bonding during 
the rolling operation, the two contact 
faces are degreased and wire-brushed 
before placing them in contact and the

stacked sheets are then rolled again to 
one-half thickness. Thus, a series of 
rolling, cutting, brushing, and stacking 
operations are repeated so that ultimately 
a large strain is accumulated in the sheet. 
It is possible to heat the sheet when roll-
ing but at a temperature where there is no 
recrystallization. For the ARB process, 
the equivalent strain after N cycles, εN, 
is given by εN = 0.80N.18 
 In practice, the UFG structure pro-
duced by ARB is not three-dimensionally 
equiaxed but rather there is a pancake-
like structure which is elongated in the 
lateral direction. This microstructural 
feature is the same irrespective of the 
types of metals and alloys. The ARB 
process may be applied for the production 
of metal-matrix composites by sheathing 
mixed powders and subjecting them to 
a roll-bonding process.19 
Multi-Directional Forging
 Multi-directional forging was applied 
for the ﬁ rst time in the ﬁ rst half of the 
1990s for the formation of UFG struc-
tures in bulk billets.20,21 The process of 
MDF is usually associated with dynamic 
recrystallization in single-phase metals/
alloys.
 The principle of MDF is illustrated in 
Figure 4 and it assumes multiple repeats 
of free-forging operations including set-
ting and pulling with changes of the axes 
of the applied load. The homogeneity 
of the strain produced by MDF is lower 
than in ECAP and HPT. However, the 
method can be used to obtain a nano-
structured state in rather brittle materials 
because processing starts at elevated 
temperatures and the speciﬁ c loads on 
tooling are relatively low. The choice 
of the appropriate temperature-strain 
rate regimes of deformation leads to the 
desired grain reﬁ nement. The operation 
is usually realized over the temperature 
interval of 0.1–0.5 Tm, where Tm is the 
absolute melting temperature, and it is 
useful for producing large-sized billets 
with nanocrystalline structures.22
Cyclic Extrusion and 
Compression
 Cyclic extrusion and compression 
(also sometimes called “hourglass 
pressing”) is performed by pushing a 
sample from one cylindrical chamber of 
diameter do to another with equal dimen-
sions through a die with diameter dm 
which is markedly smaller than do;23 the 
principle is illustrated in Figure 5. Thus, 
the processing induces extrusion and the 
chambers provide compression so that, 
during one cycle, the material is pushed 
to ﬁ rst experience compression, then 
extrusion, and ﬁ nally compression again. 
The true strain produced in one cycle is 
calculated as Δε = 4 ln (do/dm). In the 
second cycle, the extrusion direction is 
reversed, leading to the same sequence of 
deformation modes. The process can be 
repeated N times by pushing the sample 
back and forth to give an accumulated 
true strain of (NΔε). With a diameter 
ratio of typically dm/do ≈ 0.9, the strain 
imposed on the material in one cycle is 
Δε ≈ 0.4. Accumulated true strains of up 
to 90 have been reported23 with sample 
dimensions of about 25 mm in length 
and 10 mm in diameter. The deformation 
speed is as low as ~0.2 mm/s in order 
to limit heating of the specimen to <5 
K. Although the strains reached with 
this method are much higher than those 
with any unidirectional SPD technique, 
the microstructure and/or mechanical 
properties are similar because of the 
extra annihilation of dislocations due to 
the cyclic character of the straining.24 
Repetitive Corrugation and 
Straightening 
 Repetitive corrugation and straight-
ening was introduced recently and the 
principle is illustrated in Figure 6.25 In 
a repetitive two-step process, the work-
piece is initially deformed to a corrugated 
shape and then straightened between two 
ﬂ at platens using a processing cycle that 
may be repeated many times. The RCS 
facility illustrated in Figure 6 subjects 
the workpiece to both bending and 
shear, which promotes grain reﬁ nement.

Processing by RCS was used to produce 
nanostructures in a copper sample with an 
average initial grain size of 760 μm.25,26 
A similar procedure was used later for 
grain reﬁ nement of aluminum.27
 An advantage of RCS is that it can 
be adapted easily to current industrial 
rolling facilities. It is not difﬁ cult to 
machine a series of corrugating teeth 
into the rollers of a conventional rolling 
mill, thus enabling the RCS process, and 
this has the potential of producing nano-
structured materials in a continuous and 
economical way.28 The RCS technique is 
currently in the early stages and further 
research is needed to develop the process 
to a mature SPD technique for producing 
nanostructured materials. One critical 
issue is the need to design equipment 
and processing schedules for improving 
microstructural homogeneity.
Twist Extrusion 
 The use of TE for grain reﬁ nement was 
introduced in 200429 and the principles 
are illustrated in Figure 7. During TE, a 
workpiece is pushed through an extrusion 
die whose cross section maintains its 
shape and size while it is twisted through 
a designated angle around its longitudinal 
axis. As a result, the workpiece regains 
its shape and size after each TE pass and 
thus it is possible to repetitively process 
a sample for excellent grain reﬁ nement. 
A variety of cross-sectional shapes, but 
not circular geometries, are possible 
with this technique. In practice, and by 
analogy to HPT, the plastic strain is not 
uniform across the cross section but the 
plastic strain increases with the distance 
from the axis so that the more distant 
regions have a ﬁ ner grain size. This 
microstructural heterogeneity leads to 
inhomogeneous mechanical properties 
with the cross-sectional center having 
the lowest strength. It is anticipated that 
the microstructural homogeneity may 
improve with increasing numbers of TE 
passes. 
 See the sidebar on page 37 for back-
ground on the development of nanoSPD 
in materials science.
BULK UFG MATERIALS: 
MAIN STRUCTURAL 
FEATURES AND 
PROPERTIES
 The average grain size achieved in pure 
metals using various SPD techniques 
usually lies in the range of ~150–300 
nm but in alloys it may be signiﬁ cantly 
smaller.9 For example, using HPT with 
the intermetallic Ni3Al produced a grain 
size of 60 nm and in TiNi alloys process-
ing by HPT led to total amorphization.32,33 
At the same time, the structural features 
of SPD-processed metals are quite com-
plex and they are characterized not only 
by the formation of ultraﬁ ne grains but 
also by the presence of non-equilibrium 
grain boundaries with a high density of 
extrinsic (as opposed to geometrically 
necessary) dislocations  and vacan-
cies,26,34 high lattice distortions, and 
possibly, changes in the local phase 
composition.9,35
 The genesis of UFG structures pro-
duced by SPD techniques is not yet fully 
understood. While some authors relate 
them to in-situ recrystallization,36 others 
place the origin in the formation or frag-
mentation of a dislocation cell structure 
whose size scale decreases as the stress 
rises during SPD processing.37–39 The 
accumulation of the misorientation 
between neighboring dislocation cells 
occurs in parallel with the decrease of the 
average cell size and leads to a gradual 
transformation of the dislocation cell 
structure. In particular, predominantly 
polarized dipole walls yield a new reﬁ ned 
grain structure in which polarized tilt 
walls are prevalent, causing high angles 
of misorientation between the grains.38,39 
According to this view, the smallest grain 
size achievable by SPD cannot be smaller 
than the length scale of the precursor 
structure and thus of the dislocation cell 
size, which has an order of magnitude of 
some hundreds of nanometers. Recently, 
it was found that HPT processing of elec-
trodeposited nickel induced the growth 
of grains to a ﬁ nal size close to the lower 
grain size limit for HPT reﬁ nement of 
coarse-grained nickel, suggesting that 
there exists a ﬁ nal grain size determined 
by the processing parameters rather than

THE DEVELOPMENT OF NanoSPD AS AN IMPORTANT 
AREA OF MATERIALS SCIENCE
 In principle at least, severe plastic deformation (SPD) processing has a long history, 
dating back to the metalworking of ancient China.30 In modern terms, the ﬁ rst signiﬁ cant 
evaluation of the principles of SPD processing lies in the classic early experiments 
by Bridgman in the United States31 where, as in modern processing, high hydrostatic 
pressures were effectively combined with concurrent straining. For current practitioners 
of SPD processing, the most important early contribution is the work of Segal and co-
workers in Minsk10 where the technique of equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) 
was ﬁ rst introduced in a form that is essentially identical to the procedure now used in 
many laboratories around the world. The interest in SPD processing was subsequently 
stimulated by the recognition that it may be used to produce exceptional grain reﬁ nement 
in bulk solids and thus it is a processing tool for achieving unusual and beneﬁ cial 
properties.6,8
 As a consequence of this early work, there was a general recognition in the 1990s that 
SPD processing was becoming an important research area having a signiﬁ cant potential 
for use in a wide range of industrial applications. Accordingly, this led to the organizing 
of the NATO Advanced Research Workshop on Investigations and Applications of 
Severe Plastic Deformation, held in Moscow, Russia, in August 1999.1 Subsequently, 
a second meeting titled Nanomaterials by Severe Plastic Deformation was held in 
Vienna, Austria, in December 2002.2 At that time, an International NanoSPD Steering 
Committee was established to regulate these meetings and to provide assistance for 
associated activities within the broad ﬁ eld of SPD. This committee was formed with 
Ruslan Z. Valiev, a professor at Ufa State Aviation Technical University, as the chairman 
and with ﬁ ve additional members who constitute the co-authors of this paper. Shortly 
after its foundation, the committee established a website to bring together all interested 
participants in the SPD ﬁ eld and to provide broad information on new developments, 
publications in the ﬁ eld, forthcoming meetings, and a general listing of key personnel. 
This website can be accessed at www.nanospd.org.
 Recently, the third conference in the series, designated NanoSPD3, was held in 
Fukuoka, Japan, in September 2005.3 This conference aimed not only to evaluate 
new properties through SPD processing but also to bring new ideas for its practical 
applications. The next international conference in the series, NanoSPD4, will be held 
on 17–22 August, 2008, in Goslar, Germany, under the chairmanship of Yuri Estrin, a 
professor at Clausthal University of Technology. Full details of this meeting are available 
on the ofﬁ cial website: www.iww.tu-clausthal.de/NanoSPD4.
by the total imposed strain.40 Neverthe-
less, a consistent model explaining the 
formation of nanosized grains by SPD 
processing is yet to be developed.
 The most important feature of SPD 
processing is that it leads to exceptional 
grain reﬁ nement and thereby provides an 
opportunity to signiﬁ cantly enhance the 
properties of materials as well as to attain 
novel and/or unique properties. One 
such unique property is the unexpected 
combination of high strength and high 
ductility which was observed for the ﬁ rst 
time in UFG copper and titanium41 and 
later demonstrated for a range of metals 
and alloys processed by SPD.4,42–44 At the 
same time, these studies revealed that the 
unique combination of high strength and 
high ductility is conditioned by subtle 
structural features of UFG materials 
such as the non-equilibrium state of 
the grain boundaries, the availability 
of a bimodal grain distribution, or the 
presence of nanoparticles of second 
phases. These results lead to the emer-
gence of new deformation mechanisms 
in nanostructured solids including the 
occurrence of grain boundary sliding at 
low temperatures45 and the generation 
of partial dislocations and twinning.46 
The speciﬁ c processing of SPD and the 
associated simultaneous improvement of 
both strength and ductility is probably 
responsible also for the marked enhance-
ment of fatigue strength and fracture 
toughness in these materials.47 Another 
extraordinary property of UFG materi-
als is their ability to exhibit superplastic 
ductility at exceptionally high strain 
rates and unusually low temperatures,9,48 
which provides an opportunity for the 
rapid superplastic forming of complex-
shaped parts for use in the transportation 
and consumer product industries.49
 Although most efforts to date have 
been directed toward improving the 
mechanical properties of structural 
materials processed by SPD, there is 
also recent evidence for other interesting 
developments. A general observation is 
that the increase in grain boundary area 
introduced by SPD can lead to enhance-
ments in various kinetic properties of 
metallic materials. For example, it was 
found that the kinetics of plasma nitriding 
of several steels is accelerated by pre-
treatment by HPT.50 Similarly, but more 
importantly in view of potential applica-
tions with environmental considerations, 
it was shown that the kinetics of hydrogen 
absorption/desorption in magnesium 
alloy ZK60 are accelerated by ECAP 
processing and by a combination of 
ECAP and high-energy ball milling.51 
These ﬁ ndings suggest interesting new 
avenues for SPD applications target-
ing the development of new functional

materials. 
 It should be emphasized that the 
complex structure of SPD-processed 
materials may also result in multifunc-
tional properties. For example, the nano-
structured TiNi alloy demonstrates an 
extraordinary combination of very high 
mechanical and functional properties 
including superelasticity and a shape-
memory effect.52 Such a combination in 
the TiNi alloy is in stark contrast to its 
conventional coarse-grained counterpart. 
Another example is SPD-processed 
magnetic materials such as Fe-Co.53 
Not only does the nanometer grain size 
induce advanced mechanical properties 
but it leads also to enhanced soft mag-
netic properties due to an interaction 
of magnetic moments across the grain 
boundaries in these materials. Thus, the 
engineering of multifunctional materials 
is rapidly becoming a new direction in 
the science of SPD nanomaterials. 
ONGOING RESEARCH 
AND TRENDS 
 Markets for bulk nanostructured 
materials appear to exist in every product 
sector where superior mechanical prop-
erties (in particular, high strength, good 
strength-to-weight ratio, and excellent 
fatigue life) are critical. Formal market 
analyses have identiﬁ ed a wide range of 
potential applications for nanometals in 
various industries including aerospace, 
transportation, medical devices, sports 
products, food and chemical processing, 
electronics, and conventional defense.54 
Therefore, it is reasonable to antici-
pate that nanostructuring aimed at an 
enhancement of the properties of mate-
rials will remain the basic task of SPD 
processing into at least the near future. 
New opportunities are provided by recent 
ﬁ ndings in the nanoSPD area such as 
SPD-induced phase transformations55–57 
and SPD-induced vacancy generation,58 
both of which may lead to the formation 
of novel nanostructures and properties.
 At the present, the SPD techniques 
are starting to emerge from laboratory-
scale research and to gain increasing 
appreciation and understanding for the 
potential commercial applications of 
various UFG materials.54,59–62 This evo-
lution is revealed in several ways. First, 
both pure metals and commercial alloys 
are currently under extensive research 
and the latter have a great potential for 
special applications. Second, growing 
attention is being directed within the 
SPD community to the development 
of economically feasible continuous 
production methods for the processing 
of UFG metals and alloys.61–63 As an 
example, two different processing routes, 
including ECAP, were used recently for 
the systematic fabrication of long rods 
from nanostructured titanium materials 
for medical applications.61 Speciﬁ cally, 
using a combination of ECAP and ther-
momechanical treatments with a com-
mercial-purity titanium, it was possible 
to achieve a yield stress of 1,100 MPa 
and ultimate tensile strength of 1,230 
MPa together with a reasonable elon-
gation to failure of ~14%.64 Using this 
procedure, titanium rods were fabricated 
with diameters of 6.5 mm and lengths 
of more than 800 mm and with varia-
tions in the mechanical properties along 
their lengths of not more than ±5%. An 
important additional consideration was 
that the rate of material utilization was 
more than 65%. These results provide a 
clear demonstration of the great poten-
tial inherent in using a combination of 
SPD processing and thermomechanical 
treatments for the commercial produc-
tion of semi-products from titanium for 
medical applications. It is anticipated 
that similar approaches may be used also 
to fabricate UFG materials for a range 
of other applications as, for example, 
in weight-sensitive products such as 
high-performance mountain bicycles 
and automotive components.59
 Scaling to larger billet sizes is equally 
feasible in SPD processing. A recent 
investigation evaluated the effect of up-
scaling on the mechanical properties, 
microstructure, and hot-workability of 
an Al-6061 alloy from a laboratory scale 
with a diameter of 12.5 mm to an indus-
trial scale with a diameter of 100 mm.65 
This latter investigation and all earlier 
studies have consistently conﬁ rmed the 
feasibility of up-scaling ECAP process-
ing for the fabrication of large-scale 
components. Alternatively, down-scal-
ing of the SPD processing techniques 
may open up interesting new directions 
in the fabrication of micro-mechanical 
devices. A recent report described the 
ﬁ rst results of ECAP processing using 
millimeter-scale dies66 and another SPD-
like process, so-called solid-state inﬁ ltra-
tion, was also proposed where there was a 
penetration of solid aluminum in a porous 
steel preform under a high imposed pres-
sure.67 Although these techniques are in 
their infancy, the general philosophy and 
the basic features of SPD processing are 
clearly also applicable in this domain.
