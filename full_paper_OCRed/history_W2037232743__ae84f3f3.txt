Comparing methods of measurement: why plotting difference against 
standard method is misleading  
 
J Martin Bland, Douglas G Altman 
 
Summary 
When comparing a new method of measurement with a 
standard method, one of the things we want to know is 
whether the difference between the measurements by the 
two methods is related to the magnitude of the 
measurement.  A plot of the difference against the standard 
measurement is sometimes suggested, but this will always 
appear to show a relationship between difference and 
magnitude when there is none.  A plot of the difference 
against the average of the standard and new measurements is 
unlikely to mislead in this way.  We show this theoretically 
and illustrated by a practical example.

Introduction 
In earlier papers [1,2] we discussed the analysis of 
agreement between methods of clinical measurement.  We 
had two issues in mind: to demonstrate that the analyses 
then in general use were incorrect and misleading, and to 
recommend a more appropriate method.  We saw the aim of 
such studies as to determine whether two methods agreed 
sufficiently well for them to be used interchangeably.  This 
led us to suggest that the analysis should be based on the 
differences between measurements on the same subject by 
the two methods.  The mean difference would be the 
estimated bias, the systematic difference between methods, 
and the SD of the differences would measure random 
fluctuations around this mean.  We recommended 95% 
limits of agreement, mean difference plus or minus 2 (more 
precisely, 1.96) SDs, which would tell us how far apart 
measurements by the two methods were likely to be for 
most individuals.   
Figure 1 shows a typical data set, the measurement of 
systolic blood pressure by a test method, finger pressure, 
and a standard method, arm blood pressure.  This is a 
random subsample of 200 observations from a larger data 
set. [3, 4]  The sub-sample was drawn to avoid cluttered 
graphs.  The mean difference, finger minus arm, is 4.3 mm 
Hg and the SD is 14.6 mm Hg.  Hence the lower 95% limit 
is  4.3 - 1.96x14.6 = -24 mm Hg and the upper 95% limit is 
4.3 + 1.96x14.6 = 33 mm Hg.  Thus we estimate that for 
95% of subjects the finger measurement will be between 24 
mm Hg below the arm measurement and 33 mm Hg above 
it. 
For the mean and SD of the differences to be meaningful 
estimates we must assume that they are reasonably constant 
throughout the range of measurement.  We suggested 
checking this assumption graphically. [1, 2]  The usual plot, 
method one versus method two, is inefficient because the

points tend to be clustered along the line of equality (figure 
1), especially if the two methods give closely related 
measurements.  We therefore proposed that the difference be 
plotted against the average of the measurements by the two 
methods (figure 2).   
In figure 2 we have also added the 95% limits of 
agreement and the regression line of difference on average.  
The main departure from assumptions we were expecting 
was an increase in variability, shown by an increase in the 
scatter of the differences, as the magnitude of the 
measurement increased.  There may also be a trend in the 
bias, a tendency for the mean difference to rise or fall with 
increasing magnitude.  Either would show that the methods 
did not agree equally through the range.  In figure 2, for 
example, there is an increase in bias with magnitude, shown 
by the positive slope of the regression line.  Such deviations 
from assumptions can often be dealt with by a suitable 
transformation, usually logarithmic. [2]  In particular, this 
approach will be effective if the differences are proportional 
to the magnitude of the measurement. 
The 95% limits of agreement approach has been widely 
adopted and the Lancet paper [2] widely cited. [5]  
However, it is sometimes argued that when one method may 
be regarded as a `gold standard', it is presumably more 
accurate than the other method and so we should plot the 
difference against the gold standard. [6,7]  We think that this 
idea is misguided and is likely to lead to misinterpretation.  
Here we will show why, and that the plot of difference 
against average is almost always preferable. 
 
Plotting difference against average 
We denote our standard measurement by S  the new or test 
measurement by T , their variances by σ S
2  and σ T
2 , and 
their correlation by ρ .  If the study includes a wide range 
of measurements, and unless the two methods of

σ T

can examine the possibility of a relation appearing in the 
plot from the expected correlation coefficient between 
difference and average, which can be shown to be

This is zero if the variances are equal, and will be small 
unless there is a marked difference in the variability between 
subjects for the two methods. 
If there is a genuine trend in the difference with 
increasing magnitude of the measurement, the variances will 
be different.  For example, if the test measurement tends to 
be less than the standard for low values of the measurement 
and greater than the standard for high values, the test 
measurement will have more very low and more very high 
values than the standard and so will have a greater variance.   
Thus there will be a non-zero correlation between difference 
and average, and the plot of difference against average 
should show the trend.   
The two methods of measurement may also have 
different variances in the absence of a genuine association 
between difference and magnitude, due to one method 
having greater measurement error (variation within the 
subject) than the other.  This will only be noticeable if one

method has considerably more measurement error than the 
other, otherwise the effect will be swamped by the variation 
between subjects in the quantity being measured.  We can 
estimate this measurement error only by making repeated 
measurements by the same method.  In the ideal study, each 
method would be used at least twice on each subject, in 
random order, to avoid any time or order effects. [2]  
For the blood pressure data, the correlation between 
difference and average is 0.17 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.30, p = 
0.02), suggesting that the difference increases with the 
magnitude of the measurement, though the relation is weak 
(figure 2).  The variances of the two methods differ for the 
blood pressure data, being 542 for the standard arm-
measurement and 658 for the test finger-measurement 
(variance ratio of test/standard = 1.21, 1.03 to 1.42).

This correlation will usually be negative.  In particular, if 
there is no difference between the variances of the two 
methods and so no relationship between difference and 
magnitude, the plot of difference against standard will still 
show a correlation.  In this case, the formula reduces to

.  This spurious correlation will be small 
when the methods being compared are themselves highly 
correlated, and will increase as the correlation between the 
two methods themselves falls.  For the blood pressure data, 
the correlation between finger and arm pressures is 0.83.  
The expected correlation between difference and standard in 
the absence of any genuine relationship between difference 
and magnitude is therefore

The plot of test minus standard difference against standard 
shows a downward slope (figure 3).  The correlation 
between difference and standard is -0.14 (-0.28 to 0.00, p = 
0.04).  Thus we have a negative correlation between 
difference and standard as predicted, although it is smaller 
than we would have expected.  This is because there appears 
to be a positive correlation between difference and 
magnitude in this example.

This correlation will usually be positive.  Thus in the 
absence of a genuine association between difference and 
magnitude, the plot of difference against test measurement 
will suggest a positive relationship (figure 4), whereas the 
plot of difference against standard will suggest a negative 
one (figure 3).  This shows that both plots are liable to be 
very misleading and any relationship found liable to be an 
artifact of the method of analysis.  For the blood pressure 
data the correlation between difference and the measurement 
by the test method, finger blood pressure, is 0.44 (0.32 to 
0.54, p < 0.0001) (figure 4).  Thus we get significant 
correlations in different directions! 
 
Conclusions 
The plot of difference against standard measurement will 
show a relation, whether there is a true association between 
difference and magnitude or not.  The plot of difference 
against the average is more useful in almost all applications 
to medical measurements.
