Evidence based cardiology
Psychosocial factors in the aetiology and prognosis of
coronary heart disease: systematic review of prospective
cohort studies
Harry Hemingway, Michael Marmot
Do psychosocial factors cause coronary heart disease
or affect survival among patients with coronary heart
disease? Here we use an explicit methodological qual-
ity filter to review systematically the prospective
cohort studies testing specific psychosocial hypoth-
eses. This review of the epidemiological literature
identifies the psychosocial factors that have been most
rigorously tested. Only four psychosocial factors met
the quality filter: type A/hostility, depression and anxi-
ety, work characteristics, and social supports. The
importance of other study designs—for example, eco-
logical
1 or nested case-control
2–4 studies—is acknowl-
edged. The review should be seen as complementary
to existing reviews
5–8 on single psychosocial factors
and as a challenge to investigators in the field to
ensure that the systematic review is made unbiased,
kept up to date, and used to guide future hypothesis
testing.
What is a psychosocial factor?
A psychosocial factor may be defined as a measure-
ment that potentially relates psychological phenomena
to the social environment and to pathophysiological
changes. The validity and reliability (precision) of the
questionnaire based instruments used to measure psy-
chosocial factors has been improved through the use
of psychometric techniques. By avoiding the unhelpful
general term of “stress,” recent work has developed
theoretical models—for example, the job control-
demands-support
model
of
psychosocial
work
characteristics—which generate specific hypotheses
that can be tested.
How might psychosocial factors be
linked to coronary heart disease?
Evidence of mechanisms linking psychosocial factors
with coronary heart disease (reviewed elsewhere
9 10) is
important in making causal inferences and therefore
in designing preventive interventions. Psychosocial
factors may act alone or combine in clusters
11 and may
exert effects at different stages of the life course.
12
Broadly, three interrelated pathways may be consid-
ered. Firstly, psychosocial factors may affect health
related behaviours such as smoking, diet, alcohol
consumption, or physical activity, which in turn may
influence the risk of coronary heart disease.
13 If such
behaviours do lie on the causal pathway between psy-
chosocial factors and coronary heart disease, then
treating them as confounding variables, as some stud-
ies do, must be questioned. Secondly, psychosocial fac-
tors
may
cause
direct
acute
or
chronic
patho-
physiological changes. Thirdly, access to and content
of medical care may plausibly be influenced by, for
example, social supports (but there is little direct
evidence for this). Although it is beyond the scope of
this review to consider the determinants of adverse
psychosocial factors, socioeconomic status is inversely
associated with coronary heart disease
14 and also with
certain psychosocial factors, and it has been proposed
that psychosocial pathways may play a mediating
role.

Summary points
In healthy populations, prospective cohort
studies show a possible aetiological role for type
A/hostility (6/14 studies), depression and
anxiety (11/11 studies), psychosocial work
characteristics (6/10 studies), social support
(5/8 studies)
In populations of patients with coronary heart
disease, prospective studies show a prognostic
role for depression and anxiety (6/6 studies),
psychosocial work characteristics (1/2 studies),
and social support (9/10 studies); none of five
studies showed a prognostic role for type
A/hostility
Although this review can not discount the
possibility of publication bias, prospective cohort
studies provide strong evidence that psychosocial
factors, particularly depression and social support,
are independent aetiological and prognostic
factors for coronary heart disease

Method of systematic review
A methodological quality filter was used to select studies
for inclusion in the systematic review, so that the
strength of evidence could be compared across psycho-
social factors. Prospective cohort studies are the best
observational design for questions of aetiology and
prognosis. The studies included had a prospective
cohort design; a population based sample (aetiological
studies in healthy populations); at least 500 participants
(aetiological studies) or 100 participants (prognostic
studies in populations of patients with coronary heart
disease); measurements of a psychosocial factor used in
at least two different study populations; outcomes of
fatal coronary heart disease or non-fatal myocardial inf-
arction or (prognostic studies only) all cause mortality.
Articles were identified by Medline search (1966-
97), manual searching of the bibliographies ofretrieved
articles, previous review articles, writing to research-
ersin the field, and an in-house bibliographic database.

psychosocial exposures exists, and hand searching of
journals was not performed, so there is a serious
potential for publication bias. For this reason as well as
the lack of standardised methods of measurement of
psychosocial factors, we carried out a narrative, rather
than
quantitative,
systematic
review.
Given
that
randomised controlled trials, at least for primary
prevention, are rarely feasible, observational studies are
likely to remain the main type of evidence on which to
base preventive action.
Evidence for specific psychosocial factors
Largely on the basis of studies in middle aged men
(table 1), four groups of psychosocial factors were
identified
by
using
the
predefined
quality
filter:
psychological
traits
(type
A
behaviour,
hostility),
psychological states (depression, anxiety), psychologi-
cal interaction with the organisation of work (job
control-demands-support), and social networks and
social support. In simple terms this corresponds to a
spectrum with mainly psychological components at
one end and a stronger social component at the other.
The box summarises the key results.
Hostility and type A behaviour
Type A behaviour pattern—the only personality trait
which met the criteria of our review—is characterised
by hard driving and competitive behaviour, a potential
for hostility, pronounced impatience, and vigorous
speech stylistics. The instruments for measurement of
type A behaviour and hostility—the Jenkins activity
scale, the structured interview, the Minnesota multi-
phasic personality inventory (MMPI), the Bortner hos-
tility
scale—have
been
subjected
to
psychometric
testing and incorporated into many cardiovascular
cohort studies, including some that have not reported
results. Unlike other psychosocial factors, type A is dis-
tinguished by being the subject of numerous interven-
tion trials.
17 On the basis of early positive findings in
the Framingham study
18 and the Western Collaborative
Group’s eight year follow up,
19 among other evidence,
the National Institutes of Health declared type A an
independent risk factor for coronary heart disease.
However, with the publication of negative findings
20–22
it was proposed that a more specific component of
type A, namely hostility, might be aetiological, although
there are conflicting studies. None of the five studies
that examined type A or hostility in relation to
prognosis among patients with coronary heart disease
showed an increased risk; indeed, one suggested a
protective effect.
Depression and anxiety
The relation between depression and anxiety and cor-
onary heart disease differs from those of other psycho-
social factors for several reasons. Firstly, unlike other
psychosocial factors, depression and anxiety represent
well defined psychiatric disorders, with standardised
instruments for measurement. Secondly, depression
and anxiety are commonly the consequence of coron-
ary heart disease, and the extent to which they are also
the cause poses important methodological issues.
Thirdly, the ability to diagnose and treat such disorders
makes them attractive points for intervention. Finally,
depression and coronary heart disease could share
common antecedents—for example, environmental
stressors and social supports.
Table 2 shows the results from the 11 prospective
studies that investigated depression or anxiety in the
aetiology of coronary heart disease, all of which were
positive. All three of the prospective studies examining
the effect of anxiety in the aetiology of coronary heart
disease had positive results. Intriguingly, there is some
evidence that this effect is strongest specifically for
phobic anxiety and sudden cardiac death. Wassertheil-
Smoller
23 reported the effect of depression in relation
to cardiovascular events among 4367 healthy older
people. An increase in depression symptoms (but not
the baseline scores) predicted events, even when multi-
ple covariates were controlled for. Such findings are
compatible with the hypothesis that premonitory signs
of coronary heart disease such as angina or breathless-
ness may have led to the increase in depression.
Studies with longer periods of follow up are less likely
to be confounded by the possibility of early disease
causing depression, but raise further questions about
Studies showing role of psychosocial factors
In healthy populations, prospective cohort studies
suggest a possible aetiological role for:
• Type A/hostility (6/14 studies)
• Depression and anxiety (11/11 studies)
• Psychosocial work characteristics (6/10 studies)
• Social support (5/8 studies)
In coronary heart disease patient populations,
prospective studies suggest a prognostic role for:
• Type A/hostility (0/5 studies)
• Depression and anxiety (6/6 studies)
• Psychosocial work characteristics (1/2 studies)
• Social support (9/10 studies)
Although this review cannot discount the possibility of
publication bias, prospective cohort studies provide
strong evidence that psychosocial factors, particularly
depression and social support, are independent
aetiological and prognostic factors for coronary heart
disease.

the time course of exposure. For example, it is possible
that there is a common trigger (such as viral illness)
that precipitates both symptoms of depression and
atherothrombotic processes. By examination of sub-
clinical manifestations of coronary heart disease (using
non-invasive
measures
of
arterial
structure
and
function, for example) before the onset of symptoms,
the temporal sequence of the relation might be better
understood.
Depression in patients after myocardial infarction
seems to be of prognostic importance beyond the sever-
ity of coronary artery disease. Although discrete major
depressive episodes are not uncommon after a myocar-
dial infarction, depressive symptoms are more prevalent.
Given the graded relation between depression scores
and risk, the long lasting nature of the effect, and the
stability of the depression measured across time, it has
been proposed that depression is a continuously
distributed chronic psychological characteristic.
Psychosocial work characteristics
The longstanding observation that rates of coronary
heart disease vary markedly among occupations—
more than can be accounted for by conventional risk
factors for coronary heart disease—has generated a
quest for specific components of work that might be of
aetiological importance. The dominant “job strain”
model of psychosocial work characteristics, as pro-
posed by Karasek and Theorell, grew out of secondary
analyses of existing survey data on the labour force.
This model proposes that people in jobs characterised
by low control over work and high conflicting demands
might be high strain. A subsequent addition to the
model was that social support might buffer this effect.
The advantage of the model is that it generates specific
hypotheses for testing.
Table 3 shows prospective cohort studies that have
examined the relation between job strain and coronary
heart
disease.

measurements (assigning a score on the basis of job
title) of job strain have been made. Self reports may be
biased by early manifestations of disease, and ecologi-
cal measurements may lack precision. The finding that
these methods tend to give reasonably consistent
results suggests that they are complementary. Six of the
10 studies were had positive results. There is growing
emphasis on the importance of low job control rather
than on conflicting demands,
24 and it seems likely that
these empirical results will lead to a reformulation of
the model. Alternative models of psychosocial work
characteristics involve an imbalance between the effort
at work and rewards received.
25 26
Social network structure and quality of social
support
Social supports and networks relate to both the
number of a person’s social contacts and their quality
(including emotional support and confiding support).
Marital status—information routinely sought in clinical
practice—is a simple measure of social support, and the
ability of low social support to predict all cause
mortality has long been recognised. It has been
proposed that social supports may act to buffer the
effect of various environmental stressors and hence
increase susceptibility to disease,
27 but most of the evi-
dence supports a direct role.
Five of the eight prospective cohort studies that
investigated aspects of social support in relation to the
incidence of coronary heart disease were positive (table
4). Nine of the 10 prognostic studies were positive, and
the relative risks for three of these studies exceeded 3.
Despite the strength and consistency of these findings,
the relative effect of structural and functional aspects of
social supports has yet to be delineated.
Modification of psychosocial factors
The main implications of these findings for clinical
practice
are
summarised
in
the
box.
A
recent
meta-analysis found that psychosocial interventions
are associated with improved survival after myocardial
infarction.
28 However, two recent large randomised
controlled trials of psychological rehabilitation after
myocardial infarction found no difference in anxiety
and depression, and this may in part explain the lack of
effect on mortality.
29 30 Randomised controlled trials of
modification of social supports after myocardial infarc-
tion show a decrease in cardiac death or reinfarction
rates.
31 A patient’s social circumstances should be
elicited as part of the history, and the doctor may have
a role in mobilising social support. A multicentre trial
of
3000
patients
after
myocardial
infarction
(ENRICHD—enhancing recovery in coronary heart
disease) is currently under way in the United States. It
will target patients at high psychosocial risk (those who
are depressed or socially isolated) and enrol large
numbers of women and ethnic minorities.
The potential for primary prevention in relation to
psychosocial factors lies largely outside the remit of cli-
nicians. Psychosocial factors themselves are deter-
mined largely by social, political, and economic factors
and it is therefore policy makers who influence the
structure and function of communities—in the public
and private domains—who may have scope for primary
prevention.
Conclusion
Of the large number of psychosocial factors that have
been studied, only four met the quality filter: type
A/hostility, depression and anxiety, work characteris-
tics, and social supports. While this review cannot
discount
the
possibility
of
publication
bias,
the
prospective observational studies show aetiological
roles for social supports, depression and anxiety, and
work characteristics and prognostic roles for social
supports and depression. Further evidence of a causal
role is provided by human and other primate evidence
of biological and behavioural pathways mediating
these
effects.
However,
conflicting
data
exist
on
whether psychosocial interventions reduce mortality
after myocardial infarction. This systematic review
should be updated and expanded to include other
observational study designs and other endpoints (for
example, all cause mortality) in order to focus future
research and, ultimately, policy. In this expanding area,
future primary research might investigate the:
x Interrelationships between different psychosocial
factors
x Effect of change in and cumulative exposure to
psychosocial factors
x Short and long term effects thoughout the life
course
x Differences by sex, ethnic group, and country
x Behavioural and biological mechanisms involved
x Effect of psychosocial factors on different clinical
and subclinical outcomes
x Appropriate primary and secondary preventive
measures.

Studying for the MRCP—was it worth while?
When in 1996 I decided to do part of my further vocational
training in Britain, I also decided to attempt the membership
examination of the Royal College of Physicians. I knew it was said
to be difficult, but as I was advanced in my training and always
had passed examinations easily, I thought of it as a challenge.
I started studying and soon was annoyed by the multiple choice
questions. So many of them were irrelevant to clinical medicine.
Does it really matter whether I know all the rare associations of
rare diseases? In a preparation course for part 1 I learnt that
questions starting “there is a recognised association” almost
always are true while questions containing the words “always” or
“never” almost always are wrong. This knowledge helped me to
pass the MRCP1—it did not enable me to treat my patients any
better.
Part 2 had the same preoccupation with rare diseases. To pass
the MRCP, it is more important to know about secondary
hypertension caused by endocrine disorders than to know about
idiopathic hypertension. You are more likely to encounter a
question about pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism than about
osteoporosis. Did you ever meet a patient with
pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism in real life? Simply to learn
how to pronounce this word took me hours of hard work. In the
MRCP, a patient with neuropathy will have porphyria or lead
intoxication in real life the diagnosis will be diabetes or
alcoholism. In Germany I have done close to 1000
echocardiography studies, but I never saw an atrial myxoma until
I started learning for the MRCP.
The training of an examination routine for the short cases had
some advantages, but once again, the emphasis was placed on
details of little meaning. The examination routine taught in
Germany is slightly different from the one taught for the MRCP.
I had to readjust to the British routine, not because it was better
but because it was what the examiners were looking for. By the
way, I never saw one of my consultants perform the complete
MRCP routine while examining a patient in outpatients or during
a ward round.
I tried part 2 three times and failed. I then returned to
Germany where I passed the German examination and now hold
the German equivalent of the certificate of completion of
specialist training.
Has all the studying been worth while? I learnt hundreds of
small facts I have already forgotten again—if I ever need them I
know where to look them up; I got proficient at a routine I have
shed again; and whenever I notice my consultant’s vitiligo I tell
myself he is perfectly healthy and unlikely to develop an
autoimmune disease. This is real life, after all.
“Non scholae sed vitae discimus”—we learn not for school, but
for life—was written above the main entrance of my school. Much
of what I learnt in those two years in Britain was for the MRCP
and not for practice. Instead of studying most of my time off duty,
I could have gone out with friends, visited famous places, enjoyed
walking in the Midlands. I would not have worked so hard if I had
not wanted to pass the MRCP. I failed, but yes, I would do it again.
And I will come back to Britain in my holidays to enjoy all those
things I missed because of my studies.
