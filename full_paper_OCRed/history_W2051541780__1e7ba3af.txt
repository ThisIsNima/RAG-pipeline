Abstract
Non-LTR retrotransposons – including LINE-1 (or L1), Alu and SVA elements – have proliferated
during the past 80 million years of primate evolution and now account for approximately one third
of the human genome. These transposable elements are now known to affect the human genome in
many different ways: generating insertion mutations, genomic instability, alterations in gene
expression and also contributing to genetic innovation. As the sequences of human and other primate
genomes are analyzed in increasing detail, we are begining to understand the scale and complexity
of the past and current contribution of non-LTR retrotransposons to genomic change in the human
lineage.
Also known as “jumping genes”, transposable elements (TEs) are discrete pieces of DNA that
can move from site to site within (and sometimes between) genomes. Although their discovery
dates back to the 1940s1, it took about half a century before we began to understand how TEs
interact with their genomic environment. A crucial stage was reached with the completion of
the first human genome sequence, which revealed that nearly half of our genome is derived
from TEs2,3 (FIG. 1a). Actually, this is likely to be an underestimate, as many ancient TEs
inserted in the human genome have probably diverged beyond recognition3. The scale of the
contribution of TEs to the human genome is all the more remarkable when considering that
protein-coding regions account for just 1.5% of the human genome3.
TEs can be separated into two major classes: DNA transposons and retrotransposons. DNA
transposons, which make up ~3% of the human genome (FIG. 1a), are able to excise themselves
from the genome, move as DNA and paste themselves into new genomic sites4. Although they
are currently not mobilizing in the human genome, they were active during early primate
evolution, until ~37 million years (My) ago5. Retrotransposons duplicate via RNA
intermediates that are reverse-transcribed and inserted at new genomic locations4.
Retrotransposons can be subdivided into two groups, distinguished by the presence or absence
of LONG TERMINAL REPEATS (LTRs). Human LTR elements are endogenous retroviruses which account
for ~8% of the genome (FIG. 1a). Most endogenous retroviruses inserted in the human genome

>25 My ago, and their activity is presently very limited in humans, if occurring at all3,6. By
contrast, the vast majority of human TEs result from the present and past activity of non-LTR
retrotransposons, typified by LINE-1 (or L1), Alu and SVA elements, that collectively account
for about one third of the human genome3 (FIG. 1a). L1, Alu and SVA non-LTR
retrotransposons are the only TEs unequivocally shown to be currently active in humans, as
demonstrated by more than 60 reported cases of de novo insertions responsible for genetic
disorders7-11.
The extremely high density of TEs in our genome poses the question: what is their evolutionary
significance and impact during human evolution? The development of innovative molecular
methodologies such as retrotransposition assays in cultured cells12,13 and computational
techniques for comparative genomics, in conjunction with the availability of multiple primate
genome sequences (such as the human3, chimpanzee14 and macaque15 genomes), have resulted
in a progressive shift of the focus of TE research to how diverse and profound the impact of
TE activity on genomic evolution is. The past years have witnessed a number of important
discoveries regarding ways in which TEs affect human genome evolution, so it is now possible
to literally quantify the overall impact TE activity has had on shaping our genome. For example,
it has long been recognized that recombination between TEs can trigger genomic deletions in
humans, as these deletions have caused several genetic disorders8. However, only recently
have genome-wide comparisons of human and other primate genomes permitted us to
determine the magnitude and significance of TE recombination-mediated deletions at an
evolutionary scale16-18.
In this review, we focus on the evolutionary impact of non-LTR retrotransposons, which are
by far the most abundant TEs in the human genome and the most active TEs during recent
human evolution. First, we briefly describe the structure of non-LTR retrotransposons and
mechanisms by which they move. Then, we explore the evolutionary dynamics of non-LTR
retrotransposons, that is, what has made them so evolutionary successful in the human genome.
Addressing this question helps us to understand the ways in which and to what extent TEs in
general - and non-LTR retrotransposons in particular - have impacted human genome
evolution. This impact turns out to be tremendously diverse and considerable, ranging from
local instability (for example, through insertion mutagenesis and seeding of microsatellites) to
large-scale structural variation (for example, through ectopic recombination and transduction
of flanking sequences) to contributions to genetic innovation (for example, through new gene
formation and exonization) and alterations in gene expression (for example, through alternative
splicing and epigenetic regulation). Finally, we conclude with potential future research
directions.
Human non-LTR retrotransposons
L1 elements
There are >500,000 L1 copies in the human genome, resulting from their continued
mobilization activity for the past 150 My3. L1 elements constitute ~17% of the human genome,
which makes them the most successful TEs in the human genome by mass (FIG. 1a). The
canonical, full-length L1 element is ~6 kilobases (kb) in length and it consists of a 5′
untranslated region (UTR) containing an internal RNA polymerase II promoter19, two open
reading frames (ORF1 and ORF2) and a 3′ UTR containing a polyadenylation signal ending
with an oligo dA-rich tail of variable length20 (FIG. 1b). ORF1 encodes an RNA-binding
protein and ORF2 encodes a protein with endonuclease and reverse-transcriptase activities20.
This molecular machinery allows the retrotransposition process known as target-primed
reverse transcription (TPRT) to occur (BOX 1), thus making L1 elements the only autonomous
TEs in the human genome. However, not all L1 copies are competent for retrotransposition.
Indeed, as a result of the TPRT process and decay over time, most L1 copies are inactivated

by truncations, internal rearrangements and mutations3,21. Out of the >500,000 L1 elements
inserted in the human genome, less than 100 copies are intact22.
Alu elements
There are >1 million Alu copies in the human genome3, resulting from their continued
mobilization activity throughout the past ~65 My23. This makes Alu elements the most
successful TEs in the human genome in terms of copy number. The typical full-length Alu
element is ~300 base pairs (bp) in length and it exhibits a dimeric structure formed by fusion
of two monomers derived from the 7SL RNA gene24 (a component of the signal recognition
particle), which are separated by an A-rich linker region (FIG. 1c). The 5′ region contains an
internal RNA polymerase III promoter (A and B boxes) and the element ends with an oligo
dA-rich tail of variable length23. As Alu elements do not possess RNA polymerase III
termination signals, Alu transcripts extend into the downstream flanking sequence until a
terminator (typically a run of four or more consecutive Ts) is found25,26. Alu elements have
no coding capacity and are, therefore, non-autonomous TEs. Instead, they borrow the
retrotransposition molecular machinery encoded by L1 elements12 despite the fact that L1
ORF1 and ORF2 proteins exhibit strong cis-preference for L1 RNA27 (BOX 1), which is the
reason why Alu elements are sometimes referred to as “a parasite’s parasite”28.
SVA elements
There are ~3,000 SVA copies in the human genome, resulting from continued activity
throughout the ~25 My of HOMINOID evolution29,30. The typical full-length SVA element is ~2 kb
in length and it is composed of an hexamer repeat region, an Alu-like region, a variable number
of tandem repeats region, a HERV-K10-like region and a polyadenylation signal ending with
an oligo dA-rich tail of variable length29,30 (FIG. 1d). Several lines of evidence suggest that
SVA elements are transcribed by RNA polymerase II29,30. However, SVA elements apparently
contain no internal promoter and they might rely, at least partly, on promoter activity in flanking
regions29,30. Similar to Alu elements, SVA elements are non-autonomous TEs presumably
TRANS-MOBILIZED by the L1 retrotransposition machinery29,30 (BOX 1).
Other non-LTR retrotransposons
In addition to the L1, Alu and SVA elements, which are currently active, there are additional
families of old, inactive non-LTR retrotransposons that comprise a total of ~6% of the human
genome (FIG. 1a). Although far less numerous than L1 and Alu elements, these old elements
represent a rich molecular fossil record testifying to the long-term relationship between TEs
and the human genome3. This record indicates for example that before the autonomous L1
element and its Alu parasite expansions, the genome experienced retrotransposition of the
autonomous L2 element and its MIR parasite3. These old elements may have substantially
impacted human genome evolution31-34.
Evolutionary dynamics
The impact of non-LTR retrotransposons on human genome evolution largely results from
their extremely high copy numbers (for example, there is one Alu insertion every ~3 kb on
average3) and continued activity over tens of My. These two features are particularly striking
when considering the various cellular processes that control retrotransposon activity (BOX 2).
At an evolutionary scale, the vertical persistence of non-LTR retrotransposons, not only in
primates but in mammals in general, sets them apart from most other TEs in mammals and
other eukaryotes3,5,35. In this section, we discuss the evolutionary dynamics that have made
non-LTR retrotransposons so prolific during primate genome evolution.

Subfamily structure and source elements
A key concept relevant to the evolutionary dynamics of L1, Alu and SVA sequences is that
they can all be divided into subfamilies or “clades” of related elements based on diagnostic
nucleotide substitutions and insertions/deletions exclusively shared by all subfamily members.
For example, more than 200 Alu subfamilies are currently recognized in the human
genome36, but only six subfamilies of the younger SVA family exist30. Not only are subfamilies
different in age, but the diagnostic sequence mutations or changes that define subfamilies tend
to accumulate hierarchically23,37. In other words, instead of two subfamilies being
independently derived from an ancestral subfamily, most subfamilies represent an ongoing
linear sequential evolution pattern where a series of subfamilies have each been successively
derived one from the other. For example, it has been shown that during the past ~40 My, all
L1 subfamilies in the human genome are derived from a single lineage from which they arose
sequentially38. Similar patterns of subfamily evolution have been reported for Alu23 and
SVA30 elements. These observations can be explained if one assumes that only a few elements
(so-called ‘source’ or ‘master’ elements) are involved in the retrotransposition process and are
responsible for the formation of all other subfamily members37.
The “master gene” model of retrotransposon amplification37 has been refined, in particular by
quantifying the number of retrotransposition-competent elements within the human genome.
Analysis of the >200 Alu subfamilies in the human genome suggested the existence of at least
143 Alu source elements36 and it has been estimated that an average human genome carries
80-100 retrotransposition-competent L1 copies, six of which (hot L1s) are probably responsible
for the bulk of L1 retrotransposition22,39,40. These results further indicate that several source
elements may exist within a subfamily because all six hot L1 elements belong to the L1-Ta
subfamily22. A network-based analysis also revealed that human-specific Alu subfamilies
typically contain ~15% of secondary source elements that contributed ~30% of subfamily
members, in addition to a main master element41. Thus, there may be hundreds of active Alu
‘core’ sequences in the human genome42. Although they only represent a tiny fraction of all
human non-LTR retrotransposons, source elements can be considered as the ultimate drivers
of evolutionary change in the human genome because they are responsible for most L1, Alu
and SVA elements inserted in our genome.
Stealth drivers and long-term evolution
Another distinguishing feature of human retrotransposons is their persistent activity over tens
of My of evolution. How have active retrotransposons been maintained over this time?
Reconstruction of the evolutionary history of the Alu Yb lineage showed that it originated
during early HOMINOID evolution, 18-25 My ago43. Strikingly, the Alu Yb lineage has dramatically
expanded to ~2,000 copies within the past few My specifically in the human genome, as non-
human HOMINOID primates carry only a handful of Alu Yb elements43-45. Therefore, the Alu Yb
lineage remained in the genome with no or little retrotransposition for 15-20 My, while
preserving the ability to generate a high number of new copies in a species-specific manner.
These results suggest that long-lived, low-activity source elements may act as “stealth drivers”
that occasionally produce elements, some of which may become highly active. While highly
active “master” elements may be deleterious and negatively selected, low-activity stealth
drivers may allow the Alu lineage to persist on the long term43. Attenuation of mobilization
activity may be a common evolutionary strategy of various retrotransposons46,47. Therefore,
the ability to maintain low to moderate levels of retrotransposition activity may be an important
feature that allowed human retrotransposons to maintain long-term activity.

Impact on genome evolution
Amplification rates
Because of their continued activity and accumulation in the genome over tens of My, L1,
Alu and SVA elements have had a tremendous impact on the evolution of primate genomes,
both in terms of structure and function. To assess the impact of these elements on genome
evolution we can first consider how frequently retrotransposition occurs in the germline. The
current rate of Alu retrotransposition has been estimated as one insertion every ~20 births in
humans, based on both the frequency of disease-causing de novo insertions compared to
nucleotide substitutions48 and evolutionary comparisons of the human and chimpanzee
genomes48 and of multiple human genome sequences49. The current rate of L1
retrotransposition has also been estimated as one insertion every ~20 births in humans based
on disease-causing de novo insertions50 but as one insertion every ~200 births based on genome
comparisons49. The difference between the two estimates might lie in the underlying
assumptions of the methods, but no such bias is observed for Alu elements using the same
approaches. Alternatively, the difference may reflect recent variation in the L1
retrotransposition rate or intense negative selection against L1 insertions. The current SVA
retrotransposition rate has tentatively been estimated as one insertion every ~900 births based
on genome comparisons49. However, there is more uncertainty around this rate due to the
smaller datasets available for analysis. Although new heritable retrotransposition events take
place in the germline, retrotransposition also occurs in somatic tissues with an impact ranging
from cancer to a possible role in brain development8,51,52. Retrotransposon-induced somatic
variation is a fascinating area of investigation that is likely to provide new insight into TE
biology and their impact on human beings.
Amplification rates have not been uniform over time. For example, the vast majority of Alu
elements were inserted by ~40 My ago, following a peak of amplification during which there
was approximately one new Alu insertion in every birth53. Similarly, during the past ~70 My
of evolution, variation in the L1 amplification rate has been observed, with the most prolific
L1 subfamilies having amplified 12-40 My ago38. Genome-wide comparisons of the human
and chimpanzee genomes provide additional evidence for recent variation in L1, Alu and SVA
retrotransposition rates, as judged by the different numbers of species-specific elements that
have inserted since the divergence of the two species ~6 My ago14,54,55. Such fluctuation in
amplification rates on a short time-scale suggests influences at the host population level40,54.
Changes in copy number
Perhaps one of the most intuitive consequences of TE accumulation is their contribution to
genome size increase56: L1 and Alu elements alone have contributed ~750 million bases (Mb)
to the human genome sequence3 (FIG. 1). This increase in genome size is an ongoing process,
as the human genome has accumulated ~2,000 L1, ~7,000 Alu and ~1,000 SVA copies within
the past ~6 My of human evolution, a combined addition of >8 Mb14. Equally importantly, the
ongoing expansion of retrotransposons has also created significant inter-individual variation
in retrotransposon content; several hundred new mobile element insertions have been detected
between multiple human genomic sequences49,57-59. These human-specific retrotransposons
insertions are often polymorphic (present or absent) at orthologous loci among human
individuals and they constitute highly informative genetic markers that are being used to
investigate human evolutionary history, population structure and demography (BOX 3).
Local genomic instability
There are many ways through which retrotransposons can generate genomic instability. In this
section, we consider the effects of retrotransposons at a local genomic scale, linked to insertions

and their protein products, as well as consequences affecting retrotransposon sequences at a
deeper time scale.
Insertion mutagenesis
The most straightforward way in which a retrotransposon can impact upon genome function,
and thereby potentially influence genome evolution, is by inserting into protein-coding or
regulatory regions (FIG. 2a). Due to the immediate phenotypic impact of such insertions, they
were the first to be detected7. Examples of human genetic disorders caused by de novo L1,
Alu and SVA insertions continue to accumulate, with 65 cases reported to date shown to cause
various heritable diseases such as haemophilia, cystic fibrosis, Apert syndrome,
neurofibromatosis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, β-thalassemia, hypercholesterolemia and
breast and colon cancers8,9,11. Overall, it has been estimated that ~0.3% of all human mutations
are attributable to de novo L1, Alu and SVA insertions10. Interestingly, L1 (and to a lesser
extent Alu and SVA) disease-causing insertions appear to be enriched on the X
chromosome8,9,11. This observation may partly be attributable to ascertainment bias, as X-
linked genetic disorders are often dominant in males and thus more easily detected.
Alternatively, L1 elements may preferentially insert in the X chromosome, perhaps in relation
to their possible involvement in X INACTIVATION60,61.
Creating and repairing DNA double-strand breaks
It has recently been shown that the ORF2 protein encoded by L1 elements, which has
endonuclease activity, generates many more DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) than the
number associated with actual L1 insertions in mammalian cell lines62 (FIG. 2b). The extent
to which this mechanism contributes to human genomic instability remains unknown, since
the levels of L1 expression under these experimental conditions were much higher than those
expected under normal cellular conditions. However, the repair of L1-mediated DSB lesions
would leave no particular signature of L1 involvement. Thus, it is possible that a substantial
fraction of the genomic instability associated with DSBs, which are highly mutagenic and
recombinogenic, is ultimately attributable to L1 activity.
L1 and Alu elements have also been linked to DSB repair. Evidence from L1 retrotransposition
assays in cultured cells demonstrated that L1 insertions can occur independently of
endonuclease in cell lines that lack the ability to perform non-homologous end joining, a major
mechanism of DSB repair63 (FIG. 2b). Endonuclease-independent (ENi) L1 insertions lack the
hallmarks of TPRT (BOX 1), thereby suggesting that L1 elements can integrate into and repair
DSB DNA lesions63. In addition, dysfunctional telomeres can serve as substrates for ENi L1
retrotransposition and endonuclease-deficient LINE-like (Penelope) elements are present at
the telomeres of several eukaryotes, suggesting that ENi retrotransposition may be an ancestral
mechanism of RNA-mediated DNA repair associated with non-LTR retrotransposons used
before the acquisition of an endonuclease domain64,65. Recent analyses of the human genome
have shown that 0.5-0.7% of all L1 and Alu insertions have non-canonical structures and may
have resulted from ENi retrotransposition66,67, suggesting that non-LTR retrotransposons in
general, not just L1 elements, may serve as a ‘fail-safe’ mechanism in maintaining human
genome integrity.
Sources of microsatellites
Because of their abundance in the genome and because they contain HOMOPOLYMERIC TRACTS, non-LTR
retrotransposons have the ability to generate MICROSATELLITES at many loci in the genome (FIG. 2c).
This has been studied in particular for Alu elements68,69, each new copy of which provides
two potential sources of MICROSATELLITES: the linker region in the middle of the element and the 3′
oligo dA-rich tail (FIG. 1c). These HOMOPOLYMERIC repeats can experience various mutational forces
such as nucleotide substitutions and replication slippage, which may ultimately result in

MICROSATELLITES of varying length and complexity. Consequently, it is not surprising that ~20% of
all MICROSATELLITES (including ~50% of mononucleotide MICROSATELLITES) shared by the human and
chimpanzee genomes lie within Alu elements70. In addition, there are at least two examples of
expansions of MICROSATELLITES that arose from A-rich regions of Alu elements causing genetic
disorders71,72.
Gene conversion
Several studies indicate that Alu elements undergo gene conversion73,74 (FIG. 2d), a type of
recombination defined as the non-reciprocal transfer of information between homologous
sequences. Gene conversion may play a role in the evolution of Alu elements by inactivating
active copies or resurrecting inactivated copies23. For example, it has recently been shown that
the master element of the Alu Yh3a3 subfamily has been inactivated by gene conversion in
humans, thus preventing further amplification of this subfamily75. In addition, because Alu
elements make up >10% of the human genome, Alu-mediated gene conversion might have a
substantial impact on the overall nucleotide diversity of our genome. Also it might impair the
use of SNPs located within Alu sequences as genetic markers, since gene conversion would
make these SNPs IDENTICAL BY STATE rather than IDENTICAL BY DESCENT23. However, the significance of this
phenomenon has not formally been tested and the development of second-generation
sequencing approaches and personal genomics opens new avenues to resolving this question.
Genomic rearrangements
In addition to local genomic instability, retrotransposons can also generate genomic
rearrangements such as deletions, duplications and inversions. In this section, we discuss three
ways in which retrotransposons can create structural variation in the genome.
Insertion-mediated deletions
The insertion of L1 and Alu elements at new genomic sites sometimes results in the concomitant
deletion of adjacent genomic sequence (FIG. 2e). This phenomenon was first observed during
the analysis of L1 integrations within cultured human cells, where ~20% of L1 insertions were
associated with structural rearrangements, including concomitant deletions at the insertion site,
ranging in size from 1 bp to possibly >130 kb76-78. These deletions apparently can arise by
endonuclease-dependent and ENi mechanisms78. L1 and Alu insertion-mediated deletions have
subsequently been shown to occur naturally in the human and chimpanzee genomes, although
they are usually shorter (<800 bp on average) and they occur at a much lower frequency than
in cultured cells (~2% and ~0.3% of L1 and Alu insertion events, respectively)79,80. This may
reflect, at least partly, negative selection against large, disruptive insertion-mediated deletions.
Consistent with these observations, a 46 kb-long L1 insertion-mediated deletion event in the
PDHX gene has recently been implicated in pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency81
and human-chimpanzee genome comparisons identified a single insertion-mediated deletion
event that caused functional gene loss within the past ~6 My79.
It has also been noted that ~90% of non-classical, ENi L1 and Alu insertions are associated
with deletions of flanking sequence ranging in size from 1 bp to 14 kb, including one deletion
that removed an olfactory receptor gene from the human and chimpanzee genomes66,67.
Altogether, it has been estimated that during primate evolution, as many as ~45,000 insertion-
mediated deletions may have removed >30 Mb of genomic sequences18.
Ectopic recombination
Due to their extremely high copy numbers, L1 and Alu elements can also create structural
genomic variation at the post-insertion stage, through recombination between non-allelic
homologous elements (FIG. 2f), including between elements that have been inserted in the

genome for a long time. Ectopic recombination can result in various types of genomic
rearrangements such as deletions, duplications and inversions.
It has long been recognized that Alu recombination-mediated deletions (RMD) occur in the
human genome, as shown by the >70 reported cases of Alu RMDs being responsible for various
forms of cancer and genetic disorders8,10. By contrast, only three disease-causing L1 RMD
events have been reported17. Genome-wide comparisons identified 492 Alu compared with 73
L1 RMD events in the human genome since the human-chimpanzee divergence16,17. L1 RMDs
are larger on average than Alu RMDs and they occur more frequently in gene-poor regions of
the genome than Alu RMDs. These results are suggestive of negative selection against long,
deleterious L1 RMDs in gene-rich regions of the genome18,82,83. Thus, Alu and L1 RMD events
detectable by comparative genomics approaches largely represent the fraction of all RMDs
that have escaped negative selection. Yet, based on human and chimpanzee genome
comparisons, these events have collectively removed nearly 1 Mb of genomic sequence from
the human genome within the past few My16-18, thereby underscoring their important
evolutionary impact on the human genome.
The human genome contains many large (>10 kb in length) and highly similar (>90% sequence
identity) duplicated genomic regions, termed segmental duplications. Interestingly, the
boundaries of human segmental duplications are significantly enriched in Alu elements, that
is, they comprise ~24% of boundary sequences but only ~11% elsewhere in the human
genome84. Considering that ~5% of the human genome has been duplicated within the past
~40 My, recombination between Alu elements may represent an important mechanism for the
origin and expansion of segmental duplications in our genome84.
The contribution of L1 and Alu elements to chromosomal inversions has also been recently
investigated by comparative genomics. Nearly half of the inversions that took place in the
human and chimpanzee genomes since their divergence involve L1 and Alu elements, and
~20% of all inversions can clearly be identified as products of L1-L1 or Alu-Alu recombination
events85. Although this type of rearrangement does not result in gain or loss of genomic
sequence, it contributes to genomic variation sometimes with functional significance, since
several events are involved in the inversion of exons85.
Transduction of flanking sequences
In addition to duplicating themselves, L1 and SVA elements can sometimes carry upstream or
downstream flanking genomic sequences with them (termed 5′ and 3′ transduction,
respectively) (FIG. 2g). In 3′ transduction, the RNA transcription machinery skips the weak
retrotransposon polyadenylation signal and terminates transcription by using an alternative
polyadenylation signal located downstream in the 3′ flanking sequence. Similarly, 5′
transduction occurs when a promoter located upstream of the retrotransposon is used to
transcribe the sequence down to the retrotransposon86,87. The transcript containing the
retrotransposon along with the extra genomic sequence is subsequently integrated back into
the genome via retrotransposition. Initially characterized using cell culture-based methods88,
3′ transduction has subsequently been shown to occur frequently in the human genome: ~10%
of both L1 and SVA insertions are associated with 3′ transduction events30,89-91.
Genetic innovation
Variation in the number of genes among species indicates that new genes are continuously
generated over evolutionary time. Comparative genomic studies have confirmed the notion of
“evolutionary tinkering”92 according to which new genes most commonly arise by
rearrangements between pre-existing genetic structures. In this section, we explore
mechanisms by which retrotransposons have fostered genetic innovations in the human lineage.

Transduction-mediated gene formation
Retrotransposon-mediated transduction (discussed above) can lead to the duplication of coding
sequences fortuitously located in the transduced flanking genomic sequence. The potential of
L1 retrotransposons to mediate exon shuffling via 3′ transduction has been experimentally
confirmed using cell culture assays88. This mechanism has subsequently been shown to have
mediated the formation of a new gene family during recent human evolution, via multiple SVA-
mediated transduction events of the AMAC1 gene89 (BOX 4).
Gene retrotransposition
In contrast to transduction, gene retrotransposition only duplicates gene sequences and no
retrotransposon sequence is co-duplicated in the process. This is because gene
retrotransposition is based on the hijacking of the L1 retrotransposition machinery by host
mRNA transcripts93, similar to Alu and SVA retrotransposition. As a result, gene
retrotransposition generally does not duplicate upstream regulatory regions, thus requiring
duplicated genes to fortuitously acquire new regulatory regions to be functional. Therefore,
gene retrotransposition was long thought to generate non-functional duplicate gene copies
termed retropseudogenes. However, genome-wide searches have confirmed the importance of
gene retrotransposition in the emergence of new primate genes94-96 and it has been estimated
that at least one new RETROGENE per My emerged in the human lineage during the past ~65
My97 (for more detailed discussion, see ref. 96).
Exonization
Alternative splicing is a widespread mechanism that occurs in 40-60% of human genes3,98. By
producing more than one type of mRNA from a single gene, alternative splicing significantly
contributes to human proteome variation98. Interestingly, retrotransposon sequences are
sometimes recruited as exons that become integrated to genes, a process termed exonization
(FIG. 3a). It was initially estimated based on transcript sequence data that ~4% of human
protein-coding sequences contained TEs (mostly Alu and L1)99. However, a recent analysis at
the protein level more conservatively suggested that this proportion is closer to ~0.1%100.
Exonization is thought to be facilitated by the fact that many TEs carry cryptic donor and
acceptor splice sites. For example, a typical Alu sequence contains nine GT dinucleotides and
14 AG dinucleotides that represent as many cryptic donor and acceptor splice sites,
respectively101,102. Consistently, Alu exonization has occurred repeatedly during primate
evolution103. It has been estimated that ~5% of alternatively spliced exons are derived from
Alu elements in humans and that most – if not all – Alu exons are alternatively spliced
presumably because constitutively expressed Alu exons are deleterious and negatively
selected101. Consistently, the three reported cases of exonized Alu elements becoming
constitutively expressed are all associated with genetic disorders98.
Non-LTR retrotransposons have also been involved in facilitating the MOLECULAR DOMESTICATION of
other TEs. This is exemplified by SETMAR, a chimeric primate gene resulting from fusion of
a SET histone methyltransferase gene to the transposase gene of an Hsmar1 DNA
transposon104. The birth of SETMAR might have never occurred without the contribution of
an Alu element that inserted in and partially deleted the 5′-terminal inverted repeat of the
Hsmar1 element104. Because both terminal inverted repeats of DNA transposons are necessary
for transposition, the Alu insertion may have contributed to the recruitment of the Hsmar1
transposon as part of SETMAR by immobilizing it at a period when the Hsmar1 family was
experiencing high levels of transposition in primate genomes5. Overall, it is striking that non-
LTR retrotransposons seem to directly contribute a disproportionately small number of
domesticated genes compared to other TEs (such as DNA transposons), despite the fact that
they are the most numerous TEs in the human genome105,106.

Impact on gene expression
As described above, retrotransposons have dramatically impacted human evolution at the DNA
level. Evidence is also accumulating that retrotransposons significantly shape human evolution
at the RNA level through various mechanisms, which we discuss in this section.
Modulation of gene expression
Retrotransposons impact the expression of nearby genes through a variety of mechanisms.
Similar to Alu elements, L1 sequences can provide new splice sites that may promote
exonization and alternative splicing107,108 (FIG. 3a). In addition, intronic L1 elements can
interfere with transcriptional elongation of the host gene due to reduced ability of RNA
polymerase II to read through L1 sequences109 (FIG. 3b). Furthermore, retrotransposon
sequences can provide polyadenylation signals inducing termination of gene
transcripts110-112 (FIG. 3b). It has also been shown that Alu elements carry transcription factor-
binding sites that may serve to modulate gene expression113,114 (FIG. 3c). The functional
promoter sequences of L1 and Alu elements can also initiate sense or anti-sense transcription
through other genes115-117 (FIG. 3d).
The potential of L1 endogenous promoter and polyadenylation signals to create transcriptome
diversity in humans is illustrated by 15 human genes that were apparently split by L1 elements
inserted in antisense orientation in intronic sequences118. In each of these genes, a transcript
containing exons upstream of the insertion site terminates at the L1 3′ antisense polyadenylation
signal; a second transcript derived from the L1 5′ antisense promoter drives expression of a
transcript that includes the downstream exons of the gene. These observations provide a
mechanistic basis for the emergence of new gene structures by gene fission.
RNA editing
RNA editing is a process by which RNA nucleotide sequences are co- or post-transcriptionally
modified, as exemplified by the conversion of adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) in double-stranded
RNA (FIG. 3e). A-to-I editing is widespread in humans and >90% of all A-to-I substitutions
occur within Alu sequences embedded in mRNA transcripts119-122. Editing within Alu
elements might be favored by the dimeric structure of these elements and the occasional
occurrence of pairs of Alu elements in head-to-tail orientation. A-to-I editing can eliminate
splice sites and therefore might affect alternative splicing of exonized Alu sequences.
Furthermore, it has recently been shown that A-to-I editing of pairs of inverted Alu elements
in 3′ UTRs can suppress expression through nuclear retention of mRNA transcripts123.
Epigenetic regulation
The epigenetic regulation of retrotransposon activity through DNA methylation represents an
important defence mechanism for the cell (BOX 2): the L1 promoter CpG island is typically
highly methylated124, and Alu and SVA elements are enriched in CpG sites30,125 to the extent
that one third of all human CpG sites are contained within Alu sequences126. Because L1,
Alu and SVA elements are frequently found in or near genes, retrotransposon-mediated
heterochromatin formation and spread could repress transcription of nearby genes (FIG. 3f).
Consistently, Alu elements may be excluded from IMPRINTED regions of the human genome due
to their potential negative impact on methylation associated with IMPRINTING127. Similarly, it has
been proposed that the high density of L1 elements on the X chromosome may be explained
by their involvement in X INACTIVATION60,61. Under this hypothesis, L1 elements would serve as
booster stations to propagate the signal that silences one of the two female X chromosomes.
However, formal demonstration of retrotransposon-mediated epigenetic control of neighboring
genes in humans and evaluation of the extent of this phenomenon at a genome-wide scale
represent active topics of investigation in the field.

Conserved non-coding elements
Recent genome comparisons have revealed the occurrence of numerous conserved non-coding
elements (CNEs) in the human genome. Strikingly, many CNEs appear to be derived from
ancient TE sequences, in particular a class of non-LTR retrotransposons known as short
interspersed elements (SINEs, to which Alu elements belong)31-33. These ancient SINE-
derived sequences are currently evolving under strong negative selection and have apparently
taken on regulatory functions31-33. It remains unclear whether the frequent recruitment of
SINEs as CNEs reflects an endogenous functional property of these elements, is a by-product
of their high copy numbers in mammalian genomes or results from their distinctive sequence
architecture which makes them more readily identifiable as old retrotransposons106. In any
event, the genome-wide contribution of this phenomenon to human evolution remains to be
determined, but is likely to be important.
Conclusions and future directions
For tens or even hundreds of My, TEs (including non-LTR retrotransposons) have shaped the
evolution of the genomes in which they reside128. Maintaining activity over extended periods
of time is a distinguishing feature of non-LTR retrotransposons that was instrumental to their
evolutionary success in the human lineage. Our understanding of the factors underlying this
evolutionary success is still incomplete and the next few years will probably shed new light
on this intriguing question. This intricate relationship does not mean that non-LTR
retrotransposons have been maintained in the human genome on such a timescale because of
various evolutionary advantages they have conferred to their host genome. On the contrary,
we believe that the profound impact of retrotransposons on genome evolution is a by-product
of, not the reason for, the evolutionary success of these selfish genetic elements.
This view is supported by the notion that retrotransposons often represent a threat to human
health. While their involvement in causing genetic diseases through insertion mutagenesis as
a result of their sustained mobilization activity has long been established, other mechanisms
are less well understood. For example, investigating the contribution of L1 endonuclease to
the generation of DSBs in germline and somatic tissues might have important implications for
understanding the L1 integration process and interactions with DNA repair mechanisms, as
well as for chromosomal damage and human health more generally. Although the contribution
of retrotransposons to genomic deletions, such as insertion-mediated deletions and RMDs is
well established, other types of genomic rearrangements such as retrotransposon
recombination-mediated tandem duplications are less well understood, partly because they are
more difficult to characterize through computational comparisons of genome sequences. Given
that duplications are a key contributor to genetic innovation, the extent to which
retrotransposons have contributed to the formation of new genes in the human genome might
still be vastly underestimated. This is also true for many aspects of retrotransposon impact on
gene expression. For example, there is growing evidence that TEs, not just non-LTR
retrotransposons, have been a rich source of material for the assembly and evolution of
regulatory networks106. By providing a wealth of genomic and transcriptomic sequence data,
next generation sequencing and personal genomics will shed new light on the surprisingly
dynamic nature of TEs and the roles that they play in shaping within- and inter-individual
variation. This will allow researchers to dissect retrotransposon-induced variation at ever-
increasing resolution. Such information is crucial if we are to better understand the overall TE
impact on human health, genome evolution and the unique traits that make us human.
Box 1 | The retrotransposition cycle
The increase in copy numbers of non-LTR retrotransposons occurs via an RNA-based
duplication process termed retrotransposition. The first step in L1 retrotransposition

involves RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription of a genomic L1 locus from an internal
promoter that directs transcription initiation at the 5′ boundary of the L1 element19,129.
Carrying an internal promoter makes sense for a retrotransposon if it is to generate
autonomous duplicate copies at multiple locations in the genome. The L1 RNA is exported
to the cytoplasm where ORF1 (encoding an RNA-binding protein) and ORF2 (encoding a
protein with endonuclease and reverse-transcriptase activities) are translated. Both proteins
exhibit strong cis-preference27; consequently, they preferentially associate with the L1
RNA transcript that encoded them, to produce a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particle. The RNP
is then transported back into the nucleus by a mechanism that is poorly understood.
The integration of the L1 element into the genome likely occurs via a process termed target-
primed reverse transcription13,130,131 (TPRT), which was originally described for the R2
non-LTR retrotransposon of the silkworm Bombyx mori132. During TPRT, it is thought that
the L1 endonuclease cleaves the first strand of target DNA, generally at 5′-TTTT/AA-3′
consensus sites133 (a). The free 3′ hydroxyl generated by the nick is then used to prime
reverse transcription of L1 RNA (red) by the L1 reverse transcriptase (b). The second strand
of the target DNA is cleaved (c) and used to prime second-strand synthesis (d), through
poorly understood mechanisms. Hallmarks of the integration process include frequent 5′
truncations, presence of an oligo dA-rich tail at the 3′end, and 2-20 bp-long duplications of
the target site3,21 (TSD) (e).
Alu and SVA retrotransposition also likely occurs via TPRT, through the hijacking of the
L1 retrotransposition machinery12,29,30. The mechanism of Alu and SVA TRANS-MOBILIZATION by
L1 proteins remains elusive. RNA polymerase III-mediated Alu transcripts are exported to
the cytoplasm and bound to SRP9/14 proteins to form stable RNPs134,135. It has been
hypothesized that Alu RNPs interact with ribosomes, thereby positioning Alu transcripts in
close vicinity of nascent L1 ORF2 proteins12,42 (ORF1 protein enhances, but is not strictly
required for, Alu retrotransposition12,136). However, it remains unclear whether Alu RNPs
gain access to the L1 retrotransposition machinery in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus, as
Alu RNPs might recruit L1 ORF2 proteins in the nucleus and immediately proceed with
TPRT137.

Box 2 | Cellular factors influencing retrotransposition
TEs can be seen as selfish genetic entities whose spread can be deleterious to the host cell
due to the genomic instability that is induced by a massive increase in copy number. As a
result of the conflicting interests of TEs and the host genome, the cell has developed various
processes to control retrotransposon activity, as predicted by the RED QUEEN HYPOTHESIS138. Below
we provide examples of how L1 and Alu retrotransposition activity is regulated in host cells
(for more detailed discussion, see refs. 11,139).
Regulation of L1 retrotransposition can occur at the transcription level. For example, novel
regulatory regions have been frequently recruited during L1 evolution38; the current L1 5′
UTR contains several transcription factor-binding sites important for transcription
activation or initiation140-142. In addition, DNA methylation at the promoter is known to
repress L1 expression124,143. L1 elements are also subject to post-transcriptional regulation.
For example, RNA-induced silencing through RNA interference has been suggested to
reduce L1 retrotransposition in cultured cells144,145. The A-rich coding strand of the full-
length human L1 contains 19 potential canonical and noncanonical polyadenylation signals
that lead to truncation of full-length L1 transcripts by premature polyadenylation, thus
ultimately contributing to the attenuation of L1 activity110. Furthermore, cells produce
proteins such as those of the APOBEC3 family that can inhibit L1 and Alu
retrotransposition146.
Alu activity is influenced by its primary sequence in that the accumulation of mutations
across time may alter important motifs such as the internal RNA polymerase III promoter
or SRP9/14 binding motifs26,42. The accumulation of mutations is facilitated by the high
density of CpG dinucleotides that are prone to mutation as a result of the deamination of 5-
methylcytosine residues125. Overall, it has been estimated that when an Alu copy reaches
~10% divergence from its subfamily consensus sequence, the likelihood that it continues
to be active is remote42. The length and homogeneity of the oligo dA-rich tail also appear
to be important for activity 147,148. The genomic environment in which Alu copies insert is
crucial for retrotranspositional activity149-151 and the distance between the oligo dA-rich
tail at the 3′ end of the Alu sequence and the RNA polymerase III terminator located in the
downstream sequence, which determines the overall length of Alu transcripts26, is also
important.
Box 3 | Retrotransposon insertion polymorphisms as genetic markers
As revealed by pioneering studies on humans152-154, primates155 and non-primate
groups156,157, retrotransposons afford several advantages that make them very poweful
tools as genetic markers for studying human and non-human primate evolutionary
history23,157,158. They are essentially HOMOPLASY-free characters in that individuals which
share retrotransposon copies at orthologous sites have inherited them from a common
ancestor, that is precise excision of retrotransposons is extremely rare158,159. Their ancestral
state is known as the absence of the element at any locus of interest, which makes it possible
to include hypothetical ancestors for rooting of phylogenetic trees153. As there are only two
possible character states for each locus - presence or absence of the element - genotyping
of individuals for retrotransposon insertions is technically straight-forward. Furthermore,
the vast majority of retrotransposon insertions are neutral residents of the genome160, and
the gradual accumulation of elements over time makes it possible to determine loci most
suitable to a range of time points in primate history. As a result, retrotransposon insertion
polymorphisms (most notably Alu elements) have been used to decipher the phylogenetic
relationships of various primate groups161,162, including the resolution of the human-
chimpanzee-gorilla trichotomy demonstrating the close relationship between humans and

chimpanzees163. Some retrotransposons have inserted so recently during human evolution
that they are polymorphic for presence or absence among human populations and
individuals23,49,164. In particular, Alu elements have proved highly informative for the study
of human origins, by providing strong evidence for an African origin of anatomically
modern humans153,154. More recently Alu element insertion polymorphisms have been used
to investigate human population structure and demography154,165,166. Retrotransposon
insertion polymorphisms are also being used as forensic tools, for example for species-
specific DNA detection and quantitation, analysis of complex biomaterials, human gender
determination and the inference of geographic origin of human samples167.
Box 4 | Birth of a gene family by retrotransposon-mediated transduction
It has been experimentally demonstrated using cell culture assays that L1 retrotransposons
can mediate exon shuffling via 3′ transduction88. Subsequent analyses of the human genome
have confirmed that L1-mediated transduction indeed took place during human genome
evolution and that it may account for 0.6-1% of human DNA3,90,91. However, whether it
contributes to evolving new gene function remained an open question. A recent analysis of
SVA retrotransposons has demonstrated the evolutionary significance of retrotransposon-
mediated 3′ transduction, by showing that SVA-mediated transduction is responsible for
the creation of the AMAC1 gene family that comprises four copies in the human
genome89.
As part of a genome-wide analysis of SVA-mediated transduction, Xing et al. 89 identified
143 events that transduced sequences ranging in size from a few dozen bp to almost 2 kb.
Interestingly, three transduced sequences located on chromosomes 8, 17 and 18 were found
to originate from the same source locus located elsewhere on chromosome 17 (a). In the
figure, flanking sequences of the original locus are shown as blue boxes and the flanking
sequences of the transduced loci are shown as light blue boxes. Target site duplications are
shown as green arrows. SVA elements are depicted as red bars and the transduced sequences
are shown as blue bars with coding regions shown as purple bars. SVA element oligo dA-
rich tails are shown as “(AAA)n”. Analysis of the four paralogous sequences identified four
copies of the AMAC1 gene. The ancestral AMAC1L3 gene copy at the source locus consisted
of two exons separated by an intron. By contrast, the three transduced copies were intronless
versions of AMAC1L3, as a result of the splicing of the intron during the retrotransposition
process (b). Evolutionary analyses demonstrated that the three transduction events all took
place ~7-14 My ago, as human and African great apes share all four AMAC1 copies, whereas
orangutan and other primate and non-primate species that have been analyzed only possess
the ancestral AMAC1L3 gene. Experimental studies indicated that, in addition to
AMAC1L3, at least two of the three transduced AMAC1 genes are expressed in human
tissues. RNA transcript sequence analyses of the expressed AMAC1 duplicates further
revealed that the promoter sequence had been duplicated along with the AMAC1 coding
sequence as part of the 3′ transduction process. This indicates that retrotransposon-mediated
gene transduction can duplicate not only coding regions of genes but also their regulatory
regions, thus retaining functional potential after duplication. Hence, this retrotransposon-
mediated duplication mechanism can lead to rapid generation of functional gene families.

Online summary
 LINE-1 (or L1), Alu and SVA elements belong to the non-LTR retrotransposon class
of transposable elements and they account for about one third of the human genome.
 L1, Alu and SVA elements are the only transposable elements unequivocally shown
to be currently active in humans, as demonstrated by de novo insertions responsible for
genetic disorders.
 The expansion of L1, Alu and SVA elements is characterized by the dispersal, in a
series of subfamilies, of elements of different evolutionary age that share common
nucleotide substitutions and following a “master gene” model of amplification.
 The evolutionary impact of L1, Alu and SVA elements on the human genome is
tremendously diverse and considerable.
 L1, Alu and SVA elements generate instability at a local genomic scale, linked to
insertions (insertion mutagenesis and DNA repair) and their protein products
(generation of DNA double-strand breaks), as well as consequences affecting their
sequences at a deeper time scale (seeding of microsatellites and gene conversion).
 L1, Alu and SVA elements also generate genomic rearrangements such as deletions,
duplications and inversions and thus create structural variation in the genome through
insertion-mediated deletions, ectopic recombination and transduction of flanking
sequence.
 L1, Alu and SVA elements have fostered genetic innovation during human and
primate evolution through transduction-mediated gene formation, gene
retrotransposition and exonization.
 L1, Alu and SVA elements also significantly shape human evolution at the RNA
level by modulating expression of nearby genes, RNA editing and epigenetic
regulation.

Figure 1. The transposable element content of the human genome
a | The transposable element content of the human genome. About 45% of the human genome
can currently be recognized as being derived from transposable elements, the vast majority of
which are non-LTR retrotransposons such as L1, Alu and SVA elements. L1, LINE-1; LTR,
long terminal repeat. b | The canonical LINE-1 (L1) element consists of two open reading
frames (ORF1 and ORF2) flanked by 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTR). The 5′ UTR
possesses an internal RNA polymerase II promoter (grey box). The element ends with an oligo
dA-rich tail (AAA) preceded by a polyadenylation signal (pA). c | The canonical Alu element
consists of two related monomers separated by an A-rich linker region (with consensus
sequence A5TACA6). The left monomer contains A and B boxes (grey boxes) which are

promoters of transcription by RNA polymerase III. The element ends with an oligo dA-rich
tail (AAA) that can be up to one hundred bp in length. d | The canonical SVA element has a
composite structure consisting of (from the 5′ end to 3′ end): (i) a (CCCTCT)n hexamer repeat
region, (ii) an Alu-like region consisting of two antisense Alu fragments and an additional
sequence of unknown origin, (iii) a variable number of tandem repeats region made of 35-50
bp-long units, and (iv) a region derived from the env gene and the 3′ LTR of the endogenous
retrovirus HERV-K10. The element ends with an oligo dA-rich tail (AAA) preceded by a
polyadenylation signal (pA). L1, Alu and SVA elements are typically flanked by target site
duplications (black arrows) generated upon integration. Elements are not drawn to scale.

Figure 2. Impact of retrotransposons on human genome structure
a | Typical insertion of an L1, Alu or SVA retrotransposon (red box) at a new genomic site
(blue area). If the new genomic site is a genic region, the retrotransposon may cause insertional
mutagenesis. b | The protein products of an L1 element (red circle) may create DNA double-
strand breaks (broken blue area). Alternatively, an existing double-strand break may be
repaired via non-classical endonuclease-independent insertion of a retrotransposon (red box).
c | Microsatellites (e.g. (TA)n) may arise from the homopolymeric tracts endogenous to
retrotransposons. d | Gene conversion may alter the sequence compositions of homologous
retrotransposon copies (red and green boxes). e | Insertion of retrotransposons (red box) is
sometimes associated with concomittant deletion of target genomic sequences (light blue box).
f | Ectopic recombination (double arrowheaded line) between non-allelic homologous
retrotransposons (red boxes) may result in genomic reaarangements such as deletions (left) or
duplications (right) of intervening genomic sequences. g | 3′ and 5′ transduction can result in
the co-retrotransposition of downstream or upstream flanking genomic sequence, respectively,
along with a retrotransposon (left and right, respectively).

Figure 3. Impact of retrotransposons on human gene expression
a | Retrotransposon sequence (red box) can be recruited as coding sequence and integrated into
a gene (made up here of two exons, blue boxes). This is often associated with alternative
splicing (dashed lines). b | Presence of a retrotransposon (red box) in the intron of a gene
(sequence between the two blue boxes representing exons) can result in transcription elongation
defects such as attenuation or premature termination. c | Retrotransposons (red box) carry
transcription factor (green ovals) binding sites that can up- or down-regulate (green arrow) the
expression of neighboring genes (horizontal arrow and blue boxes). d | Retrotransposons (red
box) carry sense and anti-sense promoters (horizontal arrows) that can initiate downstream and
upstream transcription. e | Presence of two Alu elements in opposite orientation (red boxes) in
gene transcripts can lead to A-to-I editing, which can result in suppression of expression
through nuclear retention of edited RNA transcripts. f | Retrotransposon sequences (red boxes)
can be methylated, which may initiate and spread heterochromatin formation (green ovals),
thereby altering expression of neighboring genes (horizontal arrow and blue boxes).
