nanoparticles, silver nanoparticles have attained a special focus. Conventionally silver nanopar-
ticles are synthesized by chemical method using chemicals as reducing agents which later on
become accountable for various biological risks due to their general toxicity; engendering the
serious concern to develop environment friendly processes. Thus, to solve the objective; biologi-
cal approaches are coming up to ﬁll the void; for instance green syntheses using biological mole-
cules derived from plant sources in the form of extracts exhibiting superiority over chemical
and/or biological methods. These plant based biological molecules undergo highly controlled
assembly for making them suitable for the metal nanoparticle syntheses. The present review
explores the huge plant diversity to be utilized towards rapid and single step protocol prepara-
tory method with green principles over the conventional ones and describes the antimicrobial
activities of silver nanoparticles.

Introduction
Nanotechnology is an important ﬁeld of modern research deal-
ing with synthesis, strategy and manipulation of particle’s
structure ranging from approximately 1 to 100 nm in size.
Within this size range all the properties (chemical, physical
and biological) changes in fundamental ways of both individ-
ual atoms/molecules and their corresponding bulk. Novel
applications of nanoparticles and nanomaterials are growing
rapidly on various fronts due to their completely new or
enhanced properties based on size, their distribution and mor-
phology. It is swiftly gaining renovation in a large number of
ﬁelds such as health care, cosmetics, biomedical, food and
feed, drug-gene delivery, environment, health, mechanics,
optics, chemical industries, electronics, space industries, energy
science, catalysis, light emitters, single electron transistors,
nonlinear optical devices and photo-electrochemical applica-
tions. Tremendous growth in these expanding technologies
had opened applied frontiers and novel fundamentals. This

includes the production of nanoscale materials afterwards in
investigation or utilization of their mysterious physicochemical
and optoelectronic properties [1–3].
The nanoparticles used for all the aforesaid purposes, the
metallic nanoparticles considered as the most promising as
they contain remarkable antibacterial properties due to their
large surface area to volume ratio, which is of interest for
researchers due to the growing microbial resistance against
metal ions, antibiotics and the development of resistant strains
[2]. Among the all noble metal nanoparticles, silver nanoparti-
cle are an arch product from the ﬁeld of nanotechnology which
has gained boundless interests because of their unique proper-
ties such as chemical stability, good conductivity, catalytic and
most important antibacterial, anti-viral, antifungal in addition
to anti-inﬂammatory activities which can be incorporated into
composite ﬁbres, cryogenic superconducting materials, cos-
metic products, food industry and electronic components.
[4,5]. For biomedical applications; being added to wound
dressings, topical creams, antiseptic sprays and fabrics, silver
functions’ as an antiseptic and displays a broad biocidal effect
against microorganisms through the disruption of their uni-
cellular membrane thus disturbing their enzymatic activities.
Synthesis of silver nanoparticles is of much interest to the
scientiﬁc community because of their wide range of applica-
tions. These silver nanoparticles are being successfully used
in
the
cancer
diagnosis
and
treatment
as
well
[6,7].
Generally, nanoparticles are prepared by a variety of chemical
and physical methods which are quite expensive and poten-
tially hazardous to the environment which involve use of toxic
and perilous chemicals that are responsible for various biologi-
cal risks. The development of biologically-inspired experimen-
tal processes for the syntheses of nanoparticles is evolving into
an important branch of nanotechnology. Generally there are
two approaches which are involved in the syntheses of silver
nanoparticles, either from ‘‘top to bottom’’ approach or a
‘‘bottom to up’’ approach (Fig. 1). In bottom to top approach,
nanoparticles can be synthesized using chemical and biological
methods by self-assemble of atoms to new nuclei which grow
into a particle of nanoscale as shown in Fig. 2.a while in top
to bottom approach, suitable bulk material break down into
ﬁne particles by size reduction with various lithographic tech-
niques e.g. grinding, milling, sputtering and thermal/laser abla-
tion. (Figs. 1 and 2b).
In bottom to top approach, chemical reduction is the most
common scheme for syntheses of silver nanoparticles [8,9].
Different organic and inorganic reducing agents, such as
sodium borohydride (NaBH4), sodium citrate, ascorbate, ele-
mental hydrogen, Tollen’s reagent, N,N-dimethyl formamide
(DMF) and poly (ethylene glycol) block copolymers are used
for reduction of silver ions (Ag+) in aqueous or non-aqueous
solutions [10,11]. Capping agents are also used for size
stabilization of the nanoparticles. One of the biggest advan-
tages of this method is that a large quantity of nanoparticles
can be synthesized in a short span of time. During this type
of syntheses; chemicals used are toxic and led to non-eco-
friendly by-products. This may be the reason which leads to
the biosyntheses of nanoparticles via green route that does
not employ toxic chemicals and hence proving to become a
growing wanton want to develop environment friendly pro-
cesses. Thus, the advancement of green syntheses of nanopar-
ticles is progressing as a key branch of nanotechnology; where
the use of biological entities like microorganisms, plant extract
or plant biomass for the production of nanoparticles could be
an alternative to chemical and physical methods in an eco-
friendly manner [12].
In case of top to bottom approach; nanoparticles are gener-
ally synthesized by evaporation–condensation using a tube fur-
nace at atmospheric pressure. In this method the foundation
material; within a boat; place centred at the furnace is vapor-
ized into a carrier gas. Ag, Au, PbS and fullerene nanoparticles
have previously been produced using the evaporation/con-
densation technique. The generation of silver nanoparticles
using a tube furnace has numerous drawbacks as it occupies
a large space and munches a great deal of energy while raising
the environmental temperature around the source material,
and it also entails a lot of time to succeed thermal stability
[13–17]. In addition; a typical tube furnace requires power
using up of more than several kilowatts and a pre-heating time
of several tens of minutes to attain a stable operating tempera-
ture. One of the biggest limitations in this method is the imper-
fections in the surface structure of the product and the other
physical properties of nanoparticles are highly dependent on
the surface structure in reference to surface chemistry.
In general, whatever the method is followed, it is generally
concluded that the chemical methods have certain limitations
with them either in the form of chemical contaminations during
their syntheses procedures or in later applications. Yet; one
cannot deny their ever growing applications in daily life. For
instances; ‘‘The Noble Silver Nanoparticles’’ are striving
towards the edge-level utilities in every aspect of science and
technology including the medical ﬁelds; thus cannot be
neglected just because of their source of generation. Due to
their medicinal and antimicrobial properties, silver nanoparti-
cles have been incorporated into more than 200 consumer prod-
ucts, including clothing, medicines and cosmetics. Their
expanding applications are putting together chemists, physicist,
material scientist, biologists and the doctors/pharmacologists
to continue their latest establishments. Hence, it is becoming
a responsibility of every researcher to emphasize on an alter-
nate as the synthetic route which is not only cost effective but
should be environment friendly in parallel. Keeping in view
of the aesthetic sense, the green synthesis is rendering itself as
a key procedure and proving its potential at the top.
The advancement of green syntheses over chemical and
physical methods is: environment friendly, cost effective and
easily scaled up for large scale syntheses of nanoparticles, fur-
thermore there is no need to use high temperature, pressure,
energy and toxic chemicals [18]. A lot of literature has been
reported to till date on biological syntheses of silver nanopar-
ticles using microorganisms including bacteria, fungi and
plants; because of their antioxidant or reducing properties
typically responsible for the reduction of metal compounds
in their respective nanoparticles. Although; among the various
biological methods of silver nanoparticle synthesis, microbe
mediated synthesis is not of industrial feasibility due to the
requirements of highly aseptic conditions and their mainte-
nance. Therefore; the use of plant extracts for this purpose is
potentially advantageous over microorganisms due to the ease
of improvement, the less biohazard and elaborate process of
maintaining cell cultures [19]. It is the best platform for synthe-
ses of nanoparticles; being free from toxic chemicals as well as
providing natural capping agents for the stabilization of silver
nanoparticles. Moreover, use of plant extracts also reduces the
cost of micro-organisms isolation and their culture media

which enhance the cost competitive feasibility over nanoparti-
cles synthesis by microorganisms. Hence, a review is compiled
describing the bio-inspired syntheses of silver nanoparticles
that provide advancement over physical and chemical methods
which are eco-friendly, cost effective and more effective in a
variety of applications especially in bactericidal activities.
Green syntheses of silver nanoparticles using plant extracts
The use of plants as the production assembly of silver nano-
particles has drawn attention, because of its rapid, eco-
friendly, non-pathogenic, economical protocol and providing
a single step technique for the biosynthetic processes. The
reduction and stabilization of silver ions by combination of
biomolecules
such
as
proteins,
amino
acids,
enzymes,
polysaccharides, alkaloids, tannins, phenolics, saponins, ter-
pinoids and vitamins which are already established in the
plant extracts having medicinal values and are environmental
benign, yet chemically complex structures [20]. A large num-
ber of plants are reported to facilitate silver nanoparticles
syntheses are mentioned (Table 1) and are discussed brieﬂy
in the presented review. The protocol for the nanoparticle
syntheses involves: the collection of the part of plant of inter-
est from the available sites was done and then it was washed
thoroughly twice/thrice with tap water to remove both epi-
phytes and necrotic plants; followed with sterile distilled
water to remove associated debris if any. These; clean and
fresh sources are shade-dried for 10–15 days and then pow-
dered using domestic blender. For the plant broth prepara-
tion, around 10 g of the dried powder is boiled with
100 mL of deionized distilled water (hot percolation method).
The resulting infusion is then ﬁltered thoroughly until no
insoluble
material
appeared
in
the
broth.
To
103 M
AgNO3 solution, on addition of few mL of plant extract
follow the reduction of pure Ag(I) ions to Ag(0) which can
be monitored by measuring the UV–visible spectra of the
solution at regular intervals [21].

A vast segment of ﬂora had been utilized for the preparation
of silver nanoparticles. Different plants and their respective
portions have been exploited for the same as well. The green
rapid syntheses of spherical shaped silver nanoparticles with
dimensions of 50–100 nm were observed using Alternanthera
dentate aqueous extract. The reduction of silver ions to silver
nanoparticles by this extract was completed within 10 min.
The extracellular silver nanoparticles syntheses by aqueous leaf
extract validate quick, simple, economical process comparable
to chemical and microbial methods. These silver nanoparticles
exhibit antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia and Enterococcus faecal
[22]. Acorus calamus was also used for the synthesis of silver
nanoparticles to evaluate its antioxidant, antibacterial as well
as anticancer effects [23]. Boerhaavia diffusa plant extract was
used as a reducing agent for green synthesis of silver nanopar-
ticles. XRD and TEM analysis revealed an average particle size
of 25 nm of silver nanoparticles having face-centred cubic(fcc)
structure with spherical shape. These nanoparticles were tested
for antibacterial activity against three ﬁsh bacterial pathogens,
viz.
Pseudomonas
ﬂuorescens,
Aeromonas
hydrophila
and
Flavobacterium
branchiophilum
and
demonstrated
highest
sensitivity towards F. Branchiophilumin in comparison with
other two bacteria [24].
The relatively high levels of the steroids, sapogenins,
carbohydrates and ﬂavonoids act as reducing agents and
phyto-constituents as the capping agents which provide stabil-
ity to silver nanoparticles. The synthesized nanoparticles found
to be of average size around 7–17 nm and are of spherical
shaped. These nanoparticles were found to have a crystalline
structure with face cantered cubic geometry as studied by
XRD method. By using tea as a capping agent, 20–90 nm silver
nanoparticles were synthesized with crystalline structure.
Reaction temperature and the dosage of the tea extract showed
an effect on the production efﬁciency and formation rate of
nanoparticles [25]. The size of spherical shaped silver nanopar-
ticles is ranging from 5 to 20 nm, as evident by TEM. With
increasing intensity of extract during the period of incubation,
silver nanoparticles showed gradual change in colour of the
extracts to yellowish brown with callus extract of the salt
marsh plant, Sesuvium portulacastrum L. [26]. The dried fruit
body extract of the plant, Tribulus terrestris L. was mixed with
silver nitrate in order to synthesize silver nanoparticles. The
spherical shaped silver nanoparticles having size in range of
16–28 nm were achieved using this extract with antibacterial
property observed by Kirby-Bauer method against multi-drug
resistant bacteria such as Streptococcus pyogens, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa,
Bacillus
subtilis,
Escherichia
coli
and
Staphylococcus aureus [27]. A silver nanoparticle of size
22 nm was synthesized using extracts of the tree Cocous nuci-
fera in ethyl acetate and methanol (in ratio of EA:M40:60).
It showed signiﬁcant antimicrobial activity against human
bacterial pathogens, viz. Salmonella paratyphi, Klebsiella
pneumoniae, Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa [28].
A stable and spherical shaped silver nanoparticle was syn-
thesized using extract of Abutilon indicum. These nanoparticles
show high antimicrobial activities against S. typhi, E. coli, S.
aureus and B. substilus microorganisms [29]. Ziziphoratenuior
leaves were also used to prepare the silver nanoparticles and
different techniques were employed to characterize these nano-
particles. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis
showed that these nanoparticles were spherical and uniformly
distributed having size from 8 to 40 nm, functionalized with
biomolecules that have primary amine group, carbonyl group,
hydroxyl groups and other stabilizing functional groups as
shown by FTIR spectroscopic technique [30].
In a recent report, these nanoparticles have been synthe-
sized on irradiation using an aqueous mixture of Ficuscarica
leaf extract [31]. The silver nanoparticles were formed after
three hour of incubation at 37 C using aqueous solution of
5 mM silver nitrate. Cymbopogan citratus (DC) stapf (com-
monly known as lemon grass) a native aromatic herb from
India and also cultivated in other tropical and subtropical
countries showed strong antibacterial effect against P. aerugi-
nosa, P. mirabilis, E. coli, Shigella ﬂexaneri, S. Somenei and
Klebsiella pneumonia [32].
Silver nanoparticles were rapidly synthesized by Krishnaraj
et al. using leaf extract of Acalypha indica and the formation of
nanoparticles was observed within 30 min [33]. Formation of
stable
silver
nanoparticles
at
different
concentration
of
AgNO3 gives mostly spherical particles with diameter ranging
from 15 to 50 nm. In the pursuit of making the nanoscale-re-
search greener, the utilization of the reductive potency of a
common by-product of food processing industry i.e. orange
peel (Citrussinensis) has been reported to prepare polymer
bio-mimetic template ‘‘green’’ silver nanoparticles. TEM imag-
ing showed well dispersed spherical articles of 3–12 nm size. It
was also interesting to note that the highest fraction of parti-
cles had a diameter of 6 nm [34]. A facile and rapid biosynthe-
sis of silver nanoparticles was reported by Dwivedi et al. from
an obnoxious weed Chenopodium album. The leaf extract was
prepared and successfully used for the synthesis of silver nano-
particles and gold nanoparticles having the size in range of 10–
30 nm. The spherical nanoparticles were observed at higher
leaf extract concentration, as infer from the TEM imaging [35].
Silver nanoparticles were synthesized on reduction of silver
nitrate solution by aqueous extract of Azadirachta indica leaves
by Prathna et al. and the growth kinetics of silver nanoparti-
cles was investigated having size of 10–35 nm. Colloidal silver
nanoparticles were synthesized by an easy green method using
thermal treatment of aqueous solutions of silver nitrate and
natural rubber latex extracted from Hevea brasilensis. The sil-
ver nanoparticles presented diameter ranging from 2 nm to
10 nm and had spherical shape with face centred cubic (fcc)
crystalline structure [36].
Applications of silver nanoparticles
Due to their anti-bacterial properties, silver nanoparticles have
been used most widely in the health industry, food storage, tex-
tile coatings and a number of environmental applications. In
spite of decades of its use, it is important to note that the evi-
dences of toxicity of silver are still not clear. Products prepared
with silver nanoparticles have been approved by a range of
accredited bodies including the US FDA, US EPA, Korea’s
Testing, SIAA of Japan and Research Institute for Chemical
Industry and FITI Testing and Research Institute [34]. The
antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles have also been
exploited both in the medicine and at home. Silver sulfadiazine
creams use sometimes to prevent infection at the burn site and
at least one appliance company has incorporated silver into
their washing machines. Currently silver is used in the expand-
ing ﬁeld of nanotechnology and appears in many consumer

products that include baby paciﬁers, acne creams, and com-
puter’s keyboard, clothing (e.g. socks and athletic wear) that
protects from emitting body odour in addition to deodorizing
sprays.
It is a well-known fact that silver nanoparticles and their
composites show greater catalytic activities in the area of dye
reduction and their removal. Kundu et al. studied the reduc-
tion of methylene blue by arsine in the presence of silver nano-
particle [70]. Mallick et al. studied the catalytic activity of these
nanoparticles on the reduction of phenosafranine dye [71]. In
this study, the application of silver nanoparticles as an antimi-
crobial agent was also investigated by growing E. coli on agar
plates and in liquid LB medium, both supplemented with silver
nanoparticles [72]. Single silver nanoparticles were applied to
investigate membrane transport in living microbial cells (P.
aeruginosa) in real times [73]. The triangular silver nanoparti-
cles fabricated by nanosphere lithography indeed function as
sensitive and selective nanoscale afﬁnity biosensors. These
nanosensors retain all of the other desirable features of
Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) spectroscopy which is the
fundamental principle behind many colour based biosensor
applications and by changing nanoparticles size and shape,
these nanosensors possess at least two unique characteristics:
(i) modest refractive sensitivity and (ii) a short-range, sensing
length scale determined by the characteristic decay length of
the local electromagnetic ﬁeld. These two factors combine to
yield an area of mass sensitivity of 100–1000 pg/mm2, which
is only a factor of 100 poorer than the best propagating SPR
sensitivities [74].
Silver nanoparticles synthesized through green method
have been reported to have biomedical applications as well
as in controlling the pathogenic microbes. In a study, silver
nanoparticles were synthesized using aqueous Piper longum
fruit extract. The aqueous P. longum fruit extract and the green
synthesized silver nanoparticles showed powerful antioxidant
properties in vitro antioxidant assays [75]. The toxicity of
starch-coated silver nanoparticles was studied using normal
human lung ﬁbroblast cells (IMR-90) and human glioblastoma
cells (U251). The toxicity was evaluated using changes in cell
morphology, cell viability, metabolic activity, and oxidative
stress. These nanoparticles produced ATP content of the cell
causing damage to mitochondria and increased production
of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a dose-dependent manner.
DNA damage, as measured by single cell gel electrophoresis
(SCGE)
and
cytokinesis
blocked
micronucleus
assay
(CBMN), was also dose-dependent and more prominent in
the cancer cells [76]. The high frequency electrical behaviour
of nanosilver based conductors is up to 220 GHz. [77]. Silver
nanoparticles have proven to exert antiviral activity against
HIV-1 at non-cyto-toxic concentrations, but the mechanism
underlying their HIV-inhibitory activity has been not fully elu-
cidated. These silver nanoparticles were evaluated to elucidate
their mode of antiviral action against HIV-1 using a panel of
different in vitro assays [78]. Special interest has been directed
at providing enhanced bio-molecular diagnostics, including
SNP
detection
gene
expression
proﬁles
and
biomarker
characterization. These strategies have been focused on the
development of nanoscale devices and platforms that can be
used for single molecule characterization of nucleic acid,
DNA or RNA, and protein at an increased rate when com-
pared to traditional techniques [79].
Antimicrobial property of silver nanoparticles and its mechanism
Silver metal has been used widely across the civilizations for
different purposes. Many societies use silver as jewellery, orna-
mentation and ﬁne cutlery. Silver as jewellery, wares and cut-
lery was considered to impart health beneﬁts to the users.
Silver has a long history of anti-microbial use to discourage

contamination of microbes dating back to the Phoenicians
who used silver as a natural biocide to coat milk bottles.
Silver is a well-known antimicrobial agent against a wide range
of over 650 microorganisms from different classes such as
gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, fungi or viruses.
More recently the metal is ﬁnding use in the form of silver
nanoparticles.
In
ancient
Indian
medical
system
(called
Ayurveda), silver has been described as therapeutic agent for
many diseases. In 1884, during childbirth it became a common
practice to administer drops of aqueous silver nitrate to new-
born’s eyes to prevent the transmission of Neisseria gonor-
rhoea from infected mothers. Out of all the metals with antimi-
crobial properties, it was found that silver has the most
effective antibacterial action and is least toxic to animal cells.
Silver became commonly used in medical treatments, such as
those of wounded soldiers in World War I, to deter microbial
growth [80]. The medical properties of silver have been known
for over 2000 years [81]. Silver is generally used in the nitrate
form to induce antimicrobial effect but when silver nanoparti-
cles are used, there is a huge increase in the surface area avail-
able for the microbes to be exposed to. Silver nanoparticles
synthesized using plant extracts (from different sources) have
been used for analysing their antimicrobial activities against
different microbes (Table 2).
The antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles depend
on:
1. Size
and
environmental
conditions
(size,
pH,
ionic
strength).
2. Capping agent.
The exact mechanisms of antimicrobial or toxicity activities
by silver nanoparticles are still in investigation and a well
debated topic. The positive charge on the Ag ions is suggested
vital for antimicrobial activities. In order for silver to have any
antimicrobial properties, it must be in its ionized form. In its
ionized form, silver is inert but on coming in contact with
moisture it releases silver ions [83]. Ag+ ions are able to form
complexes with nucleic acids and preferentially interact with
the nucleosides rather than with the phosphate groups of
nucleic acids. Thus, all forms of silver or silver containing com-
pounds with observed antimicrobial properties are in one way
or another sources of silver ions (Ag+); these silver ions may
be incorporated into the substance and released slowly with
time as with silver sulfadiazine, or the silver ions can come
from ionizing the surface of a solid piece of silver as with silver
nanoparticles [86,87]. There is some literature showing the
electrostatic attraction between positively charged nanoparti-
cles and negatively charged bacterial cells [82] and they are
suggested to be most suitable bactericidal agent [84,85].
These nanoparticles have been shown to accumulate inside
the membrane and can subsequently penetrate into the cells
causing damage to cell wall or cell membranes. It is thought
that silver atoms bind to thiol groups (ASH) of enzymes form-
ing stable SAAg bonds with thiol containing compounds and
then it causes the deactivation of enzymes in the cell membrane
that involve in trans membrane energy generation and ion
transport. It was proposed that Ag(I) ion enters the cell and
intercalates between the purine and pyrimidine base pairs dis-
rupting the hydrogen bonding between the two anti-parallel
strands and denaturing the DNA molecule. Bacterial cell lysis
could
be
one
of
reason
for
its
antibacterial
property.
Nanoparticles modulated phosphotyrosine proﬁle of bacterial
peptide that in turn affects signal transduction and inhibited
growth of micro-organisms. Antibacterial effect is dose-depen-
dent and is independent of acquisition of resistance by bacteria
against antibiotics. E. coli cells treated with silver nanoparti-
cles found to be accumulated in the bacterial membrane which
results in the increase in permeability and death of cell.
Gram-positive bacteria are less susceptible to Ag+ than
gram-negative bacteria. This is due to; the gram positive bac-
terial cell wall made up of peptidoglycan molecules and has
more peptidoglycan than gram-negative bacteria. As cell wall
of gram positive is thicker, as peptidoglycan is negatively
charged and silver ions are positively charged; more silver
may get stuck by peptidoglycan in gram-positive bacteria than
in gram-negative bacteria. The decreased liability of gram-
positive bacteria can also simply be explained by the fact that
the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria is thicker than that of
gram-negative bacteria [80]. Other mechanisms involving inter-
action of silver molecules with biological macromolecules such
as enzymes and DNA through an electron-release mechanism
[88] or free radical production [80] have been proposed. The
inhibition of cell wall synthesis as well as protein synthesis
shown to be induced by silver nanoparticles has been suggested
by some literatures with the proteomic data having evidence of
accumulation of envelope protein precursor or destabilization
of outer membrane, which ﬁnally leads to ATP leaking [89].
Nanosilver is a much effective and a fast-acting fungicide
against a broad spectrum of common fungi including genera
such as Aspergillus, Candida and Saccharomyces [90].
The multi-resistant pathogens due to antigenic shifts and/or
drifts are ineffectively managed with current medications. This
resistance to medication by pathogens has become a stern
problem in public health; therefore, there is a strong require-
ment to develop new bactericides and virucides. Silver is hav-
ing a long history of use as an antiseptic and disinfectant
and is able to interact with disulphide bonds of the glycopro-
tein/protein contents of microorganisms such as viruses, bac-
teria and fungi. Both silver nanoparticles and silver ions can
change the three dimensional structure of proteins by interfer-
ing with disulphide bonds and block the functional operations
of the microorganism [30,96,97]. Advancement of this route
(green synthesis) over chemical and physical method is that
it is cost effective, environment friendly, easily scaled up for
large scale synthesis and there is no need to use high energy,
pressure, temperature and toxic chemicals [15,91–100]. The
use of environmentally benign materials like bacteria, fungi,
plant extracts and enzymes for the syntheses of silver nanopar-
ticles offers numerous beneﬁts of eco-friendly and compatibil-
ity for pharmaceutical and other biomedical applications as
they do not use toxic chemicals for the synthesis protocol.
These disadvantages insisted the use of novel and well reﬁned
methods that opened doors to explore benign and green routes
for synthesizing nanoparticles (see Fig. 3).
Conclusions
Nature has elegant and ingenious ways of creating the most
efﬁcient miniaturized functional materials. An increasing
awareness towards green chemistry and use of green route
for synthesis of metal nanoparticles lead a desire to develop
environment-friendly techniques. Beneﬁt of synthesis of silver

nanoparticles using plant extracts is that it is an economical,
energy efﬁcient, cost effective; provide healthier work places
and communities, protecting human health and environment
leading to lesser waste and safer products. Green synthesized
silver nanoparticles have signiﬁcant aspects of nanotechnol-
ogy through unmatched applications. For the syntheses of
nanoparticles employing plants can be advantageous over
other biological entities which can overcome the time con-
suming process of employing microbes and maintaining their
culture which can lose their potential towards synthesis of
nanoparticles. Hence in this regard; use of plant extract
for synthesis can form an
immense impact in coming
decades.
Many reports have been published about the syntheses of
silver nanoparticles using plant extracts like those as already
discussed. There is still a need for commercially viable, eco-
nomic and environment friendly route to ﬁnd capacity of natu-
ral reducing constituent to form silver nanoparticles which has
not yet been studied. There is a signiﬁcant variation in chemi-
cal compositions of plant extract of same species when it col-
lected from different parts of world and may lead to
different results in different laboratories. This is the major
drawback of syntheses of silver nanoparticles using plant
extracts as reducing and stabilizing agents and there is need
to resolve this problem. On identifying biomolecules present
in the plant which are responsible for mediating the nanopar-
ticles production for rapid single step protocol to overcome the
above said problem can give a new facelift towards green syn-
theses of silver nanoparticles.
