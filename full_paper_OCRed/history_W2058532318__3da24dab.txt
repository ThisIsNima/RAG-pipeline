Genetic consequences of climatic oscillations in the
Quaternary

An appreciation of the scale and frequency of climatic oscillations in the past few million years is modifying
our views on how evolution proceeds. Such major events caused extinction and repeated changes in the
ranges of those taxa that survived. Their spatial effects depend on latitude and topography, with extensive
extinction and recolonization in higher latitudes and altitudinal shifts and complex refugia nearer the
tropics. The associated population dynamics varied with life history and geography, and the present genetic
constitution of the populations and species carry attenuated signals of these past dynamics. Phylogeo-
graphic studies with DNA have burgeoned recently and studies are reviewed from the arctic, temperate
and tropical regions, seeking commonalities of cause in the resulting genetic patterns.
Arctic species show distinct shallow genetic clades with common geographical boundaries. Thus Berin-
gia is distinct phylogeographically, but its role as a refugial source is complex. Arctic taxa do not show
the common genetic pattern of southern richness and northern purity in north-temperate species. Temper-
ate refugial regions in Europe and North America show relatively deep DNA divergence for many taxa,
indicating their presence over several Ice Ages, and suggesting a mode of speciation by repeated allopatry.
DNA evidence indicates temperate species in Europe had different patterns of postglacial colonization
across the same area and different ones in previous oscillations, whereas the northwest region of North
America was colonized from the north, east and south. Tropical montane regions contain deeply diverged
lineages, often in a relatively small geographical area, suggesting their survival there from the Pliocene. Our
poor understanding of refugial biodiversity would benefit from further combined fossil and genetic studies.

1. INTRODUCTION
Our climate has been cooling for ca. 60 Myr, with the Ant-
arctic ice sheet forming ca. 35 Ma and the Arctic icecap
growing from ca. 3 Ma. The Quaternary Period has been
dominated by Ice Ages, which involve repeated global
cooling and increasing advances of these ice sheets. These
oscillations are paced by regular eccentricities in the
Earth’s orbit around the sun every 100, 41 and 21 kyr.
The large ice sheets, surrounding permafrost, lower global
temperature and reduced water availability caused great
changes in the distribution of species, which can be seen
in the fossil record (Bennett 1997; Williams et al. 1998).
Recent work with cores from ice sheets and sea beds con-
firms the effects of millennial-scale change in climate
nested within the main 100 kyr cycle. These involved
changes of as much as 7–15 °C over a few decades, which
then lasted for hundreds of years, and there is fossil evi-
dence that these, including the Younger Dryas ca. 11 ka,
caused shifts in species distributions.
The effects of Ice Ages on species ranges varied with
latitude and topography. High latitudes were covered with
ice or with permafrost, and temperate and tropical regions
were compressed towards the equator. Increased aridity

expanded. Mountain regions between the fortieth parallels
were significant because, given available lower land, mon-
tane species could descend as the climate cooled and sur-
vive the oscillations in the same region. Also, mountains
like the Alps and Appalachians, and waters like the Medit-
erranean and Gulf of Mexico, could serve as barriers to
species movement. The lowered sea-level uncovered ca.
20% more land, which in places like the Bering Strait, the
Sunda Shelf and the China Sea acted as bridges. The
extent of the range changes depended on individual spec-
ies migration and adaptations, but they were major and
repeated (Hewitt 2003).
Such latitudinal and altitudinal range shifts involved
considerable demographic changes and provided oppor-
tunities for adaptation to occur. These will clearly have
stochastic and selective effects on genetic variation and
architecture. Populations and lineages will go extinct,
alleles will be lost in bottlenecks and founder events,
mutations will occur through time and be spread by selec-
tion and population expansions. The past 15 years have
seen great advances in how these events can be studied,
and in understanding how their genetic consequences can
be used to interpret evolutionary history. Primary among
these is the ability to obtain DNA sequences readily from
most species across their geographical range. Animal
mtDNA, cpDNA and non-coding nuclear regions are
most favoured for Quaternary studies providing suitably
variable sequences. Other hypervariable markers such as
microsatellites and AFLPs are usefully employed for

studies of recent events, but they suffer from homoplasy
and do not provide clear genealogies. (For a brief intro-
duction and primary references to the various molecular
markers employed, their rates of evolution and their analy-
sis, see Hewitt (2001) and Hewitt & Ibrahim (2001).)
The DNA haplotype sequences obtained may be joined
by mutational steps into a network, and a gene phylogeny
produced in combination with closely related taxa. When
this gene tree is placed in a geographical context it has
great explanatory potential, creating the field of phylo-
geography (Avise et al. 1987; Avise 2000). The availability
of such information-rich DNA sequences has encouraged
the application of existing population genetic and spatial
methods of analysis, and the development of new ones.
This is a very active field, which includes for example,
genetic demography (Harpending et al. 1998; Emerson et
al. 2001), statistical phylogeography (Knowles & Maddi-
son 2002) and landscape genetics (Manel et al. 2003).
Combination of such techniques is being sought to extract
the data’s full information, and so test geographical evol-
utionary models.
Studies of phylogeography have grown exponentially
since its naming (Avise et al. 1987; Avise 1998; Stone
2000), particularly in North America and Europe, from
which some basic patterns have emerged and concepts
have been developed (Avise 2000; Hewitt 2000). Because
this field has grown beyond the point where the biogeogra-
phy of the whole world can be fully discussed here, the
main focus of this review is on northern latitudes, where
there have been so many recent papers. The tropics are
far more diverse and some reviews are mentioned. An
attempt will be made to outline the main processes and
conclusions so far, and highlight some currently interest-
ing areas where the Quaternary Ice Ages have had gen-
etic impact.
2. TEMPERATE EUROPE
Quaternary
phylogeography
in
Europe
and
North
America is based on fossil data, particularly the extensive
network of pollen cores, which describe the changes in
distribution of species through the recent Ice Ages
(Huntley & Birks 1983; Bennett 1997; Hewitt 1999). This
is most detailed for the last cycle (120 kyr), where it is
complemented by recent ice-core data on palaeoclimates.
A few cores go back several Ice Ages, but earlier palaeo-
biological reconstructions of distributions are necessarily
less certain. At the LGM (23–18 ka) the European ice
sheet extended south to 52° N and permafrost south to
47° N. As the ice melted, species from the tundra, cool
temperate and warm temperate habitats moved north. For
most temperate species their LGM refugia were in the
south of Europe and the colonization northwards was
rapid (Bennett 1997; Hewitt 1999).
By using DNA haplotype similarity it is possible to
deduce which northern populations of a species are
recently related to more southerly ones that now inhabit
areas near LGM refugia. The southern peninsulas of
Iberia, Italy and the Balkans–Greece, along with the
Caspian/Caucasus region acted as refugia, and many spec-
ies show taxonomic and genetic diversity in and among
these regions. The colonization patterns of northern parts
by these distinct genomes can be determined by using
Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B (2004)
suitably variable sequences with wide range sampling
(Hewitt 1996, 1999; Taberlet et al. 1998). The number
of such studies is not great, but has grown significantly in
the past 2 years. In principle, a species could colonize Eur-
ope from any of these four major temperate refugia; in
fact, DNA relationships show that in most species Balkan
genomes predominated, then Iberian, and then Italian,
with the contribution from the east being undetermined in
some species. This produced subdivisions of species into a
patchwork of genomes, often delimited with sharp hybrid
zones, and this adds much finer resolution to the fossil
record of these events. In Europe these hybrid zones are
often clustered into suture zones along the Alps and
Pyrenees, down central Europe and across Scandinavia,
where many expanding genomes met. Such suture zones
are also a feature in other parts of the world (Hewitt
2000).
These general postglacial colonization patterns from
southern refugia by land were exemplified by those of the
grasshopper Chorthippus parallelus, the hedgehog Erinaceus
europaeus/concolor, and the bear Ursus arctos, with more or
less similar ones in other species (figure 1) (Hewitt 1999).
Since then, many similar and variant species’ phylogeo-
graphies have been added. This is particularly so for fresh-
water fishes, where Europe’s rivers have often been
colonized from the Black Sea up rivers like the Danube
and the Dneiper. Perhaps they deserve a new paradigm,
illustrated by the perch or chub (table 1; figure 1). These
fishes contain several lineages with divergences indicating
disjunctions over the past 2 Myr. Many of these have clear
geographical distributions and provide evidence of older
Black Sea–Caspian Sea divergence. They also indicate
colonization of western Europe in recent interglacials and
postglacial expansions from several major refugia, parti-
cularly the Black Sea, Dneiper–Volga, Danube, Rhine–
Rhone, Elbe and other rivers. This varies in detail among
species, with those more cold-adapted, like the bullhead,
having more northerly glacial refugia. The influence of
older water bodies like the Ponto–Caspian Sea and recent
great periglacial lakes and floods is also apparent. Further
east, the application of DNA phylogeography with dis-
cerning analysis to the grayling (Thymallus spp.) of Lake
Baikal is providing new evidence and novel insights on
these ancient waters (Koskinen et al. 2002). Whereas the
major rivers contain old Pliocene lineages, Lake Baikal’s
current lineage colonized recently, ca. 110–450 ka during
recent Ice Age cycles.
Modelling and simulation of leptokurtic expansion from
the most northerly LGM populations produces reduced
allele diversity and areas of genetic homogeneity (Ibrahim
et al. 1996), and this genetic pattern has been reported in
many species from Europe and North America (see, for
example, Hewitt 1996; Soltis et al. 1997; Bernatchez &
Wilson 1998; Schmitt et al. 2002; Michaux et al. 2003).
Such leading-edge colonization has the corollary that it is
more difficult for southerly populations to expand once
the space has been filled (Hewitt 1993), and the greater
number and smaller range of southern genomes support
this.
Not all temperate species followed a rapid form of
expansion, as is clear from the fossil record. Some were
dependent on particular conditions or on other species,
and some were more affected by various barriers, habitat

distributions and prior colonizers. Such slower expansions
would involve shorter dispersal and larger effective popu-
lation sizes, which would tend to retain genetic diversity,
and would be expected in the mountain blocks of southern
temperate regions and the tropics (Hewitt 1996). These
two extreme modes of colonization, termed Pioneer and
Phalanx (Nichols & Hewitt 1994), when combined in dif-
ferent habitat distributions and climatic oscillations can
produce a variety of geographical genetic structures.
Long-distance dispersal also produced small pockets with
distinct genomes well ahead of the main population, which
could then expand to give a patchwork. This aspect has
been significantly extended to examine the causes of the
local distribution of oak (Quercus spp.) genomes that
colonized Europe from the south (Petit et al. 2001). In
deciphering the phylogeographical signals of a species it is
necessary to consider its natural history and how it
expanded and contracted in its particular range.
A feature of temperate species in southern Europe is the
presence of several distinct geographical genomes with a
variety of alleles. This richness is also seen at the subspec-
ific and specific taxonomic levels, and it probably accumu-
lated over several Ice Ages (Hewitt 1999). The toad
Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B (2004)
Bombina and hedgehog Erinaceus contain genomes that
would have diverged in the Pliocene, whereas the grass-
hopper C. parallelus and the bear U. arctos show shallower
divergence of a few Ice Ages. The association of these dis-
tinct genomes with major peninsulas argues that these
have been glacial refugia for these species lineages repeat-
edly. Hedgehogs from Sicily have a divergent mtDNA
haplotype, which indicates its survival from earlier in the
Quaternary; the rest of Italy produced younger clades that
colonized

(Santucci et al. 1998; Seddon et al. 2001). A distinct Sicil-
ian lineage also occurs in the woodmouse Apodemus
sylvaticus (Michaux et al. 2003). Such remnant popu-
lations from previous Ice Ages are also seen in the pond
turtle Emys orbicularis (Lenk et al. 1999). In the salaman-
der Salamandra salamandra (Steinfartz et al. 2000), pock-
ets of older orphan lineages are found in Spain and Italy
surrounded by more recent expansions that populate the
north. Despite nice clues like these, the phylogenetic his-
tory of such regions is not as easy to unravel as those far-
ther north that were covered by postglacial expansions.
Recent studies of a range of organisms in southern regions
are instructive, particularly in Iberia, which was an

and
plants
(Gutierrez Larena et al. 2002). They reveal the survival of
deep Pliocene lineages, often in mountain blocks, indicat-
ing altitudinal shifts with expansions and contractions
through the Ice Ages.
For many species the postglacial expansion has appar-
ently occurred from a few populations on the northern
edge of their refugial LGM distribution. Just where these
founding populations were and how they expanded
depends on the adaptations of the individual species, the
distribution of its habitat and how that changed with cli-
mate. Species with more temperate adaptations would
have refugial ranges further south in general than those
more cold-hardy. For example in small mammals, species
with southern and northern temperate species ranges
might be the woodmouse (Michaux et al. 2003) and the
field vole, Microtus agrestis (Jaarola & Searle 2002).
Clearly a good fossil record is important in determining
the limits of refugial ranges (Tzedakis et al. 2002).
The survival of populations in these southern refugial
peninsulas over few to many Ice Ages, while peripheral
areas are colonized and cleared repeatedly, allowed their
lineages to diverge and accumulate genetic differences,
and they may ultimately become species. It is a form of
repeated allopatry, and speciation may be accelerated by
selection for different adaptations (Hewitt 1996, 1999).
There is evidence that speciation has been accomplished
postglacially under strong divergent selection in certain
cases, whereas other taxa retain the ability to hybridize
despite divergence since the Pliocene. Compilations of
molecular differences in races, subspecies and species
complexes indicate that speciation has been occurring
through the Pliocene and Quaternary at various levels of
genetic divergence (Avise et al. 1998; Klicka & Zink 1999;
Hewitt 2000).
3. THE ALPS
Mountain ranges are seen as important for divergence
and speciation, both in the tropics (Fjeldsa & Lovett
1997) and in more temperate regions (Hewitt 1996, 2000;
Knowles 2000), and the Alps are a major feature in
moulding the phylogeography of European species. Their
present climate ranges from mediterranean to glacial, they
are topographically diverse, and they have acted as a bar-
rier and a refuge through climatically induced range
changes. Many present-day species in the region colonized
their present ranges from lower altitudes and latitudes,
whereas those with Arctic–Alpine distributions that were
not annihilated descended during the Ice Ages and may
have spread more widely across the cold tundra and steppe
plains. Consequently the Alps and other southern moun-
tain ranges support a diverse biota, which comprises spec-
ies with varied and complex evolutionary histories. It is
not surprising then that the application of molecular
phylogeographic methods to alpine regions is generating
a kaleidoscope of patterns and possible pathways pro-
duced by Quaternary glacial cycles.
For example, the globeflower, Trollius europaeus, shows
higher genetic diversity (AFLP) in the Alps than the

Pyrenees or northern Fennoscandia. This indicates that
the small Pyrenean populations at the southern edge of
the range have undergone genetic drift, whereas the Arctic
populations were probably the result of a postglacial foun-
der event from the south. The variation among Alpine
populations suggests that they are fragmented relics of
larger southern refugial populations (Despres et al. 2002).
By contrast, in a more temperate snail, Cepaea, detailed
sampling and many allozyme loci showed three major gen-
etic types, stretching east to west along the Pyrenees,
probably as a result of post-glacial colonization from dif-
ferent LGM sources (Ochman et al. 1983). Eastern Alpine
populations of Norway spruce, Picea abies, show fairly high
mtDNA variability and are close to probable glacial refu-
gia, whereas western Alpine populations are monomor-
phic, suggesting a postglacial colonization bottleneck and
fixation (Gugerli et al. 2001). The high Alpine plant Pritz-
elago alpina (3250 m) and the montane Anthyllis montana
(2700 m) have been compared for their genetic structure
(ribosomal ITS, AFLP) through their similar European
mountain distributions. Divergence was lower in P. alpina,
whereas A. montana showed subdivision in the Maritime
Alps. It is argued that the genomes of these species have
been moulded by different range change cycles in glacial
and interglacial periods (Kropf et al. 2003). A good
example of the detail that can be obtained for postglacial
colonization events in mountains is seen in the leaf beetle
Goniotena pallida in the Vosges (Mardulyn 2001). Using
highly variable mtDNA CR sequences, a geographical
haplotype network indicated the recent founding and
expansion of populations from the south to the north of
the mountains.
A long-standing debate concerns the ‘nunatak’ and ‘tab-
ula rasa’ hypotheses for the respective survival or extinc-
tion of species through the LGM in glaciated regions.
Recently, genetic data have been adduced both in support
and against these possibilities for particular high Alpine
or high Arctic species. For example, in the cushion plant
Eritrichium nanum, cpDNA and AFLPs identify two or
three distinct genomic regions in the Alps, and it is argued
that the populations survived in nunataks in the western
and eastern Alps through the Quaternary glaciations
(Stehlik et al. 2002). Another high Alpine plant, Phyteuma
globularifolium, can be divided on AFLPs into four clear
genetic groups along the Alps. In this case the identifi-
cation of peripheral unglaciated siliceous refugia argues for
postglacial colonization of the main glaciated body of the
Alps, with no need to invoke nunataks (Schonswetter et
al. 2002). It would seem very difficult to prove or disprove
continuous nunatak survival with fossil or genetic evi-
dence. A local population may go extinct for a while under
adverse conditions in the LGM, with recolonization from
a warm finger valley as the climate improves. And this may
be repeated. Only major areas well separated by ice for a
long time, like the Canadian High Arctic Islands, would
seem capable of yielding any clear genetic signal.
4. THE ARCTIC RING
Until recently, most species’ phylogeographies were
obtained from
temperate
regions, so
concepts were
developed and tested with these. Sampling in the Arctic
is not easy, but several Holarctic phylogeographies have
Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B (2004)
been produced, including mammals, birds, plants and
crustaceans (Weider & Hobaek 2000; table 2). Given the
much colder climate and extent of the Arctic ice sheets at
the LGM, the distribution of such species would generally
have been pushed to lower latitudes, and this is borne out
by fossil records in central Europe, central Asia and North
America. However, large areas of northeast Asia and
northwest America at these high latitudes were not glaci-
ated and refugia have been proposed on biogeographical
grounds with some fossil support, notably in Beringia
(Pielou 1991; Abbott & Brochmann 2003). Consequently,
some parts of an Arctic species distribution would have
been totally displaced, whereas others only expanded or
contracted postglacially. This could produce various sig-
natures in the genetic data.
There is phylogeographical structure in all the investi-
gated species, being very marked in small mammals like
lemmings and voles, whereas the mobile waterflea and
reindeer show less. The ptarmigan and migratory dunlin
are intermediate. The major pattern of this division is
similar in the high Arctic small mammals and purple saxi-
frage, with DNA divergence between European and
Beringian clades representing 5–10 full glacial cycles on
current rate estimates, and with further regional subdiv-
ision over fewer oscillations. The true lemming shows dis-
tinct parapatric Euro-Asian, Central Asian, Beringian and
Canadian clades, which meet near the Lena, Kolyma and
MacKenzie Rivers. The collared lemming shows five simi-
larly placed clades, with the Eurasian distribution being
further subdivided near the Ural mountains. These moun-
tains also seem to delineate the North European and Cen-
tral Asian clades of the root vole, with the latter meeting
the Beringian clade again at the Kolyma River. In the cir-
cumarctic clonal sedge Carex, the boundaries of Ca. lugens
and Ca. ensifola are also near the Lena and Kolyma Rivers,
which is also an area of high genetic diversity (Stenstrom
et al. 2001). The Kolyma River and possibly the Urals
separate DNA clades in the dunlin, which is remarkable
phylogeographical
fidelity
in
this
migratory
species.
Although the genetic divergence within the rock ptarmi-
gan and tundra reindeer is less and probably occurred
mostly within the last glacial cycle, there is sign of incipi-
ent geographical
structure
with
genotype differences
among these regions of the Arctic Ring (figure 2). Such
coincidence of boundaries is probably not due to chance,
and may reflect common range changes that tend to pro-
duce suture zones as in Europe and North America
(Hewitt 1996, 1999). A significant number of taxon
boundaries in northern birds, butterflies and other groups
also coincide with these contacts.
The development of such marked genetic structure over
several Ice Ages implies that these regional genomes have
survived separately through large range shifts and demo-
graphic fluctuations. There has been little if any effective
mixing. The genotypes now in the European Arctic prob-
ably survived in the extensive tundra of central Europe,
and fossils of several species from Late Quaternary have
been found there (table 2). They then colonized north and
east as it warmed. Similar late glacial fossils have been
recorded near the southern Urals, and populations there
could have acted as the source for the expansion of gen-
omes across the Russian Arctic. There must also have
been East Asian refugia to account for the distinct

genomes of the Lena and Kolyma River regions. Fossils
of some species occur in Beringia and it seems likely that
these genomes survived there in favourable unglaciated
parts.
The range shifts, contractions and expansions that were
involved in this Late Quaternary history of Arctic species
may be expected to leave some genetic signs of demo-
graphic changes, as well as geographical ones. The diver-
sity within many of these clades is relatively shallow or
low, indicating contractions and expansions over the last
glacial cycle (table 2). For example, the Greenland and
Svalbard small-bodied tundra reindeer have low diversity
and almost certainly colonized and adapted postglacially.
Only 4% of genetic variation occurs within lineages of the
ptarmigan, with divergence from the middle of the last Ice
Age. In the root vole most clades are shallow, and the
Central Asian one contains few haplotypes that range from
the Urals to Kolyma River, which suggests extensive post-
glacial colonization from a small source. Both the true and
collared lemmings show little diversity in Asian and Can-
adian clades. Mismatch analyses indicate an expansion in
the Beringian and Canadian clades of true lemmings, per-
haps dating from 150 ka after the penultimate glaciation
(Illinoian). With the acquisition of larger genetic datasets,
the use of automated DNA marker identification and
analysis using emerging statistical methods, clearer histori-
cal explanations will emerge on these and other Arctic
species.

5. BERINGIA
The region called Beringia is about the size of Europe
and includes Eastern Siberia and Alaska. Throughout the
Quaternary these have been joined by lowered sea-levels
during each Ice Age. There is animal and plant fossil evi-
dence for a high tundra mixture of species surviving in
unglaciated parts through the last Ice Age. Indeed, a grow-
ing number of genetic studies in a range of species
describe a distinct phylogenetic clade through the region
(table 2; figure 2). The survival of reasonable population
numbers through several glacial cycles would be expected
to retain higher genetic diversity than those in areas reco-
lonized more recently. Such a pattern is reported in several
species, including the purple saxifrage, waterflea, whitefish
(Bernatchez & Wilson 1998), the sedge Carex (Stenstrom
et al. 2001) and snow goose Chen caerulescens (Quinn
1992). But this signal is not seen in the lemmings and
root vole.
Given that Beringia was a major refugium for some Arc-
tic species through recent Ice Ages, the question arises as
to its role in the recolonization of surrounding regions. To
the west of Beringia, its effect seems limited in several
species by parapatry around the Kolyma and Lena Rivers,
which probably depends on the survival and arrival of gen-
omes from central or eastern Asian Ice Age refugia in
particular species. To the east of Beringia, the vast area
once covered by the Cordilleran and Laurentide ice sheets

Quaternary climatic oscillations and genetics
may have been colonized from several directions, includ-
ing Beringia, unglaciated parts of the Canadian High Arc-
tic, south of the ice from West and Central USA, and
from the east coast of North America. Genetic studies are
providing pertinent information on this point for several
species.
Thus cpDNA data on the arctic perennial Dryas integri-
folia combined with a good fossil record indicate that
haplotypes from a Beringian refugium spread east and
south
into
the
adjoining
previously
glaciated
areas,
whereas those in the southeast refugium around New Jer-
sey spread north (Tremblay & Schoen 1999). The genetic
data also indicate that an unglaciated High Arctic refug-
ium in the region of Bathhurst and Ellesmere Islands also
contributed significantly to the southward colonization,
although at present fossil evidence is lacking. They also
suggest that some colonization may have occurred from
the Atlantic coast of the Nearctic. Such postglacial colon-
ization from multiple refugia is also likely in the Daphnia
pulex complex, where genetic diversity declines eastwards
from the Yukon and Bathhurst Island and indicates these
regions as major contributors to nearctic colonization
(Weider & Hobaek 2003). The Beringian haplotypes of
the lake whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis only colonized a
short way south into the adjoining previously glaciated
areas, whereas those of the lake trout Salvelinus namaycush
spread broadly east and south to Baffin Island and the
US border (Bernatchez & Wilson 1998). Both these fishes
colonized other parts of the deglaciated area from other
southern and eastern refugia. Likewise mtDNA haplo-
types of the Arctic–Alpine ground beetle Amara alpina are
richest in Beringia, and colonization across to Hudson Bay
saw a reduction in diversity (Reiss et al. 1999).
However, in the collared lemming mtDNA phylogeog-
raphy indicates that haplotypes from the western Arctic
Islands colonized eastwards to Baffin Island and Green-
land, and those in Beringia did not (Fedorov & Stenseth
2002). In the true lemming it is also argued that the
mtDNA haplotypes did not spread out of a Beringian refu-
gium,
but
that
the
distinct
Arctic
Canadian
clade
colonized postglacially from the south, because there are
no fossil records in the High Arctic (Fedorov et al. 2003).
Also, in the ermine Mustela erminea the Beringian mtDNA
clade is found only in Alaska and Siberia and meets para-
patrically the continental clade in southeast Alaska. This
latter probably colonized from the south (Fleming & Cook
2002). There is genetic and fossil evidence of colonization
of the nearctic from the south in several other species. So
rather like northern Europe, deglaciated areas were vari-
ously colonized from different directions by particular
species (Hewitt 2000).
Such complex spatial and demographic changes are
highlighted by the first palaeogenetic studies in the region
on current and permafrost DNA samples of the brown
bear (Leonard et al. 2000; Barnes et al. 2002). The con-
siderable mobility of these animals is reflected in the data,
and clade monophyly and haplotype turnover suggest iso-
lation and expansion through the LGM. It is even possible
that they went extinct in Alaska from 30 ka and reco-
lonized from East Siberia after 20 kyr. So the Siberian part
of Beringia may be a long-term refugium for this species
and fossil DNA from here could be informative.

6. NORTH AMERICAN REGIONS
The recent flow of phylogeographical literature, parti-
cularly from North America (Avise 2000), precludes
detailed reporting here; it shows differences from Europe
but also there are clear similarities. Geography and climate
determine the distinctive phylogeography of species in dif-
ferent parts of both continents, and North America may
also be usefully considered as several principal regions
(Hewitt 2000). There are illuminating studies in the Arc-
tic, northwest and southwest regions, which have very dif-
ferent biotas and phylogeographical patterns that have
been produced by their distinct geography and climatic
changes. The southeast region was where molecular
phylogeography began (Avise et al. 1987), and shows high
species richness and substructure in terrestrial and aquatic
organisms (Avise 2000). This was probably generated by
survival in refugia through repeated climatically driven
range changes, somewhat like southern Europe. This
southeast biota also emphasizes that species sharing
biogeographic history can exhibit concordance of phylo-
geographical pattern and produce suture zones (Walker &
Avise 1998). The southern Appalachian region appears to
have been a refugial area for many species, and popu-
lations south of the Laurentide ice sheet have colonized
northwards postglacially. Many phylogeographies from
this northeast region show signs of this (e.g. Bernatchez &
Wilson 1998; Austin et al. 2002; Starkey et al. 2003), and
the effects of Ice Ages and postglacial colonization on the
intertidal communities of the northwest Atlantic seaboard
are apparent in comparative phylogeographies (Wares
2002). These reveal a transition (suture) zone at ca.
42° N, about the latitude to which the ice sheet extended.
(a) The Pacific northwest coast
For many species the genetic evidence shows that the
previously glaciated regions of North America were
colonized from several directions, particularly the south.
In particular, and aided by phylogeographical studies, the
colonization of the northwest quarter of the continent,
which includes Beringia, is becoming clearer. In a now
classic study, allozymes and fossil records were combined
to reconstruct the colonization of the lodgepole pine, Pinus
contorta, from south of the ice some 2200 km up the
northwest coast to the Yukon (Cwynar & MacDonald
1987). It reached southeast Alaska and the coastal islands
by 10 500 BP, but did not reach the inland side of the
coast range until 2300 BP. The phylogeography of several
species, particularly mammals, argues that this region,
where southeast Alaska meets the Yukon and British
Columbia, has been colonized from north, south and east;
it is something of a tripartite suture zone.
For example, both the longtailed vole, M. longicaudus,
and the dusky shrew, Sorex monticolus, have diverged
clades (ca. 6% cytb) that colonized from the south, on
separate coastal and inland routes. They have other dis-
tinct clades to the south in the coastal, Cascade and Rock-
ies ranges, which indicate survival over several Ice Ages,
and whence they probably colonized northward, after the
LGM (Conroy & Cook 2000; Dembolski & Cook 2001).
By contrast, tripartite colonization is deduced in the
ermine Mustela erminea, with Beringian, coastal island and
inland continental clades: one coming from the north and
two from the south (Fleming & Cook 2002). However, the

----- Page 9 (native) -----

191
divergence (1.5% cytb) between the island and Beringian
clades is less than both from the continental clade
(3.5% cytb), which suggests more complex range changes
in previous Ice Ages. It will be interesting to see if the
island clade representatives can be found down the
northwest coast route. Several plant species have distinct
cpDNA clades north from Oregon to Alaska, and these
could either be southern postglacial colonists or northern
glacial survivors (Soltis et al. 1997). On present evidence
and along with other studies, perhaps the south to north
colonization is more likely.
A rather different colonization history is suggested for
the forest-dwelling marten Martes americana (Stone et al.
2002), with the two clades present probably coming from
the regions of the Rockies and Appalachians where LGM
fossils occur. The coastal clade is currently in the western
mountains and up the northwest coast, whereas the conti-
nental clade spreads across from the Appalachians to Ala-
ska. Plant fossil data show that the forests spread quickly
up the west coast, arriving in southeast Alaska as early as
12 000 BP, whereas the northeastern forests spread rap-
idly across to the west, but only after the ice had retreated
sufficiently after 9000 BP. Several other species including
bears and chickadees probably arrived by similar routes
(Stone et al. 2002).
The high endemism of this region has attracted much
attention (Cook et al. 2001), with suggestions that it is a
refugium and deserving conservation. With genetic evi-
dence this diversity can be seen to be the result of its geo-
graphical position and varied structure, with several
postglacial colonizations by diverged genomes and rapid
local adaptive evolution. This last component is nicely
demonstrated by the clear morphological differentiation
among species
of Queen
Charlotte
Islands’ carabid
beetles, which have little or no mtDNA divergence
(Clarke et al. 2001).
(b) The west coast
Although many species colonized up the northwest
coast from the general region of the Cascades and north-
ern Rockies, accumulating genetic data reveal that they
have distinct clades to the south, forming a Cascade–
Sierra transition. There are also divergences between the
coastal Cascade and the interior Rocky Mountains. The
phylogeographies of this region that demonstrate this have
recently been reviewed by Brunsfeld et al. (2001). This
pattern of divergence applies to a wide range of animal
and plant species and indicates the survival of these clades
in or near these regions through several Ice Ages including
the last. A particularly well-considered example is that of
the tailed frog Ascaphus truei, which has a mesic forest dis-
junct range (Nielson et al. 2001). It is distributed through
the Pacific Coast Mountains from the southeast tip of
Alaska (55° N) to north of San Francisco (39° N), and in
the Northern Rockies from Idaho and Oregon (43° N) to
southern Canada (50° N). It is associated with upland
forest streams in the south, and palaeobotanical evidence
combined with reasonably dated mtDNA divergence
(13% cytbND2) places the initial divergence between
the coastal and inland clades at the beginning of the
Pliocene. Within these major clades are distinct subclades
associated with mountain blocks, whose divergence fits
within
a
Quaternary
time
frame.
The
main
Rocky
Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B (2004)
Mountains clade shows shallow divergence with local
haplotypes, which suggests contraction and expansion
associated with recent Ice Ages. Such southern montane
divergence is reminiscent of that found in southern Euro-
pean mountains, as in Iberian lizards and beetles for
example, and for similar reasons (Hewitt 2000). The role
this plays in Quaternary speciation is nicely exemplified in
grasshopper
taxa
of
Western
American
sky
islands
(Knowles 2000).
The mesic forest biome changes at the Cascade–Sierra
transition to a warmer, dryer Mediterranean one. Califor-
nia, with its mountain ranges and deserts, lies at a latitude
of southern Spain and Morocco, where the Mediterranean
Sea has for many species effectively separated Europe
from North Africa for 5 Myr. Consequently its phylo-
geography should also differ. A particular feature of Cali-
fornia is its ring of late Pliocene mountain uplift around
the hot central valley. South of the Cascades at Mount
Shasta the mountains divide into Coast and Sierra ranges,
which meet again at Tehachapi some 500 miles south.
Among other things these relatively recent uplifts have
produced some classic ring species that have been assessed
phylogeographically, notably the salamander Ensatina
eschscholtzii (Moritz et al. 1992) and recently the dusky-
footed woodrat, Neotoma fuscipes (Matocq 2002). These
show several clades with divergence beginning in the
Pliocene and continuing through the Quaternary. In
Ensatina, palaeogeography and phylogeography suggest a
northern ‘oregonensis’ genome began to migrate south
down both emerging Coast and Sierra ranges some 5 Ma,
with range contractions and expansions producing more
clades, subspecies and forms. This pattern is still being
modified by major geological and climatic changes (Wake
1997). The similar distribution of Neotoma shows a some-
what different phylogeography. Its deepest phylogenetic
divergence is ca. 2 Ma between north and south mtDNA
clades, with south and central Sierra clades diverging ca.
0.7 Ma. The shallowness and mismatch distributions of
several clades reflect recent contractions and expansions,
particularly in the northern parts of the range. Some bar-
riers like the Sacramento delta, Sierra river glaciers and
Tehachapi mountains may well explain some concordance
in racial subdivision between the salamander, woodrat and
other species (Matocq 2002).
Further
south,
into
Baja
California,
Mexico
and
increasingly drier habitats, similar comparative phylogeog-
raphy reveals several concordant genetic divergences that
are explicable by palaeogeographic events (Maldonado et
al. 2001). This combination of approaches is both exciting
and fruitful.
7. THE TROPICS
Most biodiversity resides in the tropics, but our knowl-
edge of the genetic diversity underlying this is poor com-
pared with temperate regions. There are, however, a few
pertinent genetic studies in American and Australian rain-
forests, which along with reports from Africa and Asia
begin to describe a picture of great diversity and historical
complexity, often dating from the Pliocene (Hewitt 2000;
Moritz et al. 2000).

----- Page 10 (native) -----

G. M. Hewitt
Quaternary climatic oscillations and genetics
This is exemplified by an adaptive radiation of a North
American salamander, Bolitoglossa, into tropical middle
America, which has been studied in the montane forests
of Costa Rica (Garcia-Paris et al. 2000). Phylogeographies
of birds and freshwater fishes in middle America are also
complex with many lineages (Bermingham & Martin
1998). Most of 35 species of small mammals sampled
along the Jurua River in Amazonia show a phylogenetic
divide coincident with the Iquitos Arch that formed in the
Pliocene. Another set of phylogeographical studies from
the remnant strip of tropical forest in northeast Queens-
land involves several birds, reptiles, frogs and a snail
(Schneider et al. 1998; Hugall et al. 2002). There is con-
cordant mtDNA divergence that probably dates from the
end of the Pliocene, which is coincident with a narrow
region from which rainforest disappeared in the Quatern-
ary Ice Ages.
Bird species from tropical Africa and South America
reflect the pattern seen in small mammals and amphib-
ians, with old Pliocene lineages in the lowland forest and
mixed old and recently diverged clusters in the mountains.
The properties of such tropical mountains as reservoirs
and generators of lineages and species (Fjeldsa & Lovett
1997) would seem to derive from their low latitude and
topographic variety, providing warm wet habitats through
climatic changes and altitudinal range shifts.
8. MAN AND THE ICE AGES
Genetic studies are becoming increasingly prominent in
the interpretation of human evolution through the Quat-
ernary, including the effects of climatic oscillations on our
range
changes
from
Africa
throughout
the
world
(Underhill et al. 2000; Hewitt 2001). In particular, evi-
dence from mtDNA and Y-chromosome markers suggests
that our genome contains signals of early colonization of
Europe from the near east (30–40 ka) and differentiation
in the Palaeolithic (Richards et al. 2000; Semino et al.
2000). So it is interesting to ask how much of European
human genomic structure is due to events before the later
Neolithic spread of agriculture from the near east (8–
9 ka). During the LGM modern European human range
was restricted towards the Mediterranean and we would
have colonized out from there as it warmed (ca. 16 ka).
Parts of Europe show distinct genotype frequencies, parti-
cularly from east to west (e.g. Rosser et al. 2000; Torroni
et al. 2001), and although some of these may reflect a
Neolithic gene flow route, a large proportion could reflect
a postglacial colonization pattern like the hedgehog or oak.
As more genetic data become available, its combined
analysis should clarify the importance of such range
changes on our genome.
9. CONCLUSIONS
The use of DNA markers in combination with palaeo-
climatic reconstruction is providing much new infor-
mation on the evolution of species through the climatic
oscillations of the Quaternary. It can identify genomic
subdivision and its geographical pattern across a species
range, and it provides attenuated signals of past demo-
graphic and geographical changes.
Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B (2004)
Recent studies on Arctic species reveal some congru-
ence in the locations of contact zones between their major
genomic clades, which indicates common features of their
range changes. Some regional genomes show signs of
major contraction and expansion through the last Ice Age.
Temperate species generally have less genetic variation
in colder latitudes into which they expanded after the last
Ice Age, but this depends on their particular niche and
geography. Warmer temperate regions contain greater
phylogeographical subdivision, arguing for survival and
divergence through many Ice Ages; and, in many species,
acting as refugial sources for postglacial recolonization.
Several common patterns of colonization are apparent in
Europe and North America that seem largely dependent
on geography and climate. Significantly, a region may be
colonized by several species whose genomes come from
different refugia. Geographically disjunct divergent clades
‘orphan genomes’ provide signs of range changes in earl-
ier interglacials.
The extent of genetic divergence between refugial gen-
omes varies among species and is a measure of the time
of their separation. Populations in regions where lineages
persist through several climatic cycles can accumulate
genetic differences and possibly speciate. They are not
affected by their relatives that colonize other parts, but are
eliminated by climatic reversals.
The few phylogeographical studies in the tropics reveal
great genetic diversity, with montane regions containing
shallow and deeply diverged lineages often locally distrib-
uted. This indicates survival there from the Pliocene,
accompanied by local shifts in distribution, adaptation and
speciation through Quaternary climatic oscillations.
Clearly the pattern of genetic variation in a species has
great potential to inform us on its history and the forces
involved, particularly as analytical methods develop and in
the light of new fossils and palaeoclimatic advances. These
studies may be directed to understand poorly known
regions and biomes of importance in managing biodiversity.

Discussion
A. Lister (Department of Biology, University College Lon-
don, London, UK). Would it be a correct summary of your
findings to say that populations could continue to diverge
through multiple Milankovitch cycles without being set
back to zero every time a new cycle begins? Are the diver-
gences seen on a time-scale of a few hundred thousand
years all of subspecific level, or do you have full speci-
ation too?
G. M. Hewitt. Yes, and yes. (i) Populations of a species
show various levels of genetic divergence among the
southern refugial regions of Europe. Small differences
indicate continuous survival there for only a few cycles,
like the grasshopper with some 0.8% mtDNA divergence,
whereas larger ones, like in the hedgehog with some 12%
mtDNA cytb, would require many cycles over a few
million years. They are apparently not affected by their
relatives in peripheral areas that are colonized and cleared
repeatedly by climatic oscillations. (ii) Populations in
regions where lineages persist through several climatic
cycles can accumulate genetic differences and possibly
speciate. There is growing evidence that speciation has
been accomplished postglacially under strong divergent
selection in certain cases, particularly in fishes, and rapid
divergence is seen in insects and reptiles as well. The
refugial taxa of the grasshopper Chorthippus have been
recognized as species and subspecies, though they form a
narrow hybrid zone where they meet. The two species of
hedgehog Erinaceus from the Iberian and Balkan refugia
currently form a contact zone down the centre of Europe.
There is debate about the possibility of hybridization. The
differences at various levels of taxa and the endemism
among refugial peninsulas argues for such accumulation
of differences and speciation. I think this principle can be
seen in other parts of the world, bearing in mind the parti-
cular geography and climate.
