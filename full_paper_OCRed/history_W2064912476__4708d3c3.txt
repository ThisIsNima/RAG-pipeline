Tetraodon nigroviridis is a freshwater puffer ﬁsh with the smallest known vertebrate genome. Here, we report a draft genome
sequence with long-range linkage and substantial anchoring to the 21 Tetraodon chromosomes. Genome analysis provides a
greatly improved ﬁsh gene catalogue, including identifying key genes previously thought to be absent in ﬁsh. Comparison with
other vertebrates and a urochordate indicates that ﬁsh proteins have diverged markedly faster than their mammalian homologues.
Comparison with the human genome suggests ,900 previously unannotated human genes. Analysis of the Tetraodon and human
genomes shows that whole-genome duplication occurred in the teleost ﬁsh lineage, subsequent to its divergence from mammals.
The analysis also makes it possible to infer the basic structure of the ancestral bony vertebrate genome, which was composed of
12 chromosomes, and to reconstruct much of the evolutionary history of ancient and recent chromosome rearrangements leading
to the modern human karyotype.
Access to entire genome sequences is revolutionizing our under-
standing of how genetic information is stored and organized in
DNA, and how it has evolved over time. The sequence of a genome
provides exquisite detail of the gene catalogue within a species, and
the recent analysis of near-complete genome sequences of three
mammals (human1, mouse2 and rat3) shows the acceleration in the
search for causal links between genotype and phenotype, which can
then be related to physiological, ecological and evolutionary obser-
vations. The partial sequence of the compact puffer ﬁsh Takifugu
rubripes genome was obtained recently and this survey provided a
preliminary catalogue of ﬁsh genes4. However, the Takifugu assem-
bly is highly fragmented and as a result important questions could
not be addressed.
Here, we describe and analyse the genome sequence of the
freshwater puffer ﬁsh Tetraodon nigroviridis with long-range linkage
and extensive anchoring to chromosomes. Tetraodon resembles
Takifugu in that it possesses one of the smallest known vertebrate
genomes, but as a popular aquarium ﬁsh it is readily available and is
easily maintained in tap water (see Supplementary Notes for
naming conventions, natural habitat and phylogeny). The two
puffer ﬁsh diverged from a common ancestor between 18–30
million years (Myr) ago and from the common ancestor with
mammals about 450 Myr ago5. This long evolutionary distance
provides a good contrast to distinguish conserved features from
neutrally evolving DNA by sequence comparison. Tetraodon
sequences in fact had an important role in providing a reliable
estimate of the number of genes in the human genome6.
There has been a vigorous and unresolved debate as to whether a
whole-genome duplication (WGD) occurred in the ray-ﬁnned ﬁsh
(actinopterygians) lineage after its separation from tetrapods7–9. By
exploiting the extensive anchoring of the Tetraodon sequence to
chromosomes, we provide a deﬁnitive answer to this question. The
distribution of duplicated genes in the genome reveals a striking
pattern of chromosome pairing, and the correspondence of ortho-
logues with the human genome show precisely the signatures
expected from an ancient WGD followed by a massive loss of
duplicated genes.
Moreover, we ﬁnd that relatively few interchromosomal

rearrangements occurred in the Tetraodon lineage over several
hundred million years after the WGD. This allows us to propose a
karyotype of the ancestral bony vertebrate (Osteichthyes) composed
of 12 chromosomes, and to uncover many unknown evolutionary
breakpoints that occurred in the human genome in the past
450 Myr.
The Tetraodon genome sequence
Sequencing and assembly
The Tetraodon genome was sequenced using the whole-genome
shotgun (WGS) approach. Random paired-end sequences provid-
ing 8.3-fold redundant coverage were produced at Genoscope
(GSC) and the Broad Institute of MITand Harvard (see Supplemen-
tary Table SI1). From this, the assembly program Arachne10,11
constructed 49,609 contigs for a total of 312 megabases (Mb;
Table 1), which it then connected into 25,773 scaffolds (or super-
contigs) covering 342 Mb (including gaps; see Supplementary
Information). Half of the assembly is in 102 scaffolds larger than
731 kilobases (kb; the N50 length) and the largest scaffold measures
7.6 Mb, the typical length of a Tetraodon chromosome arm.
We produced additional data to physically link scaffolds and
anchor them to chromosomes. These data include probe hybridiz-
ations to arrayed bacterial artiﬁcial chromosome (BAC) libraries,
restriction digest ﬁngerprints of BAC clones, additional linking
clone sequence, alignment to available Takifugu sequence and two-
colour ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (see Supplemen-
tary Information). The impact of these additional mapping data was
twofold: ﬁrst, we could join 2,563 scaffolds in 128 ‘ultracontigs’ that
cover 81.3% of the assembly, and second, we were able to anchor the
39 ultracontigs among the largest (covering 64.6% of the assembly,
with an N50 size of 8.7 Mb) to Tetraodon chromosomes (Fig. 1; see
also Supplementary Table SI2 and Supplementary Notes).
The accuracy of the assembly was experimentally tested and the
inter-contig links found to be correct in .99% of cases. On the basis
of a re-sequencing experiment, we estimate that the assembly covers
.90% of the euchromatin of the Tetraodon genome (Supplemen-
tary Information). Finally, the overall genome size was directly
measured by ﬂow cytometry experiments on several ﬁsh; an
average value of 340 Mb was obtained, consistent with the sequence
assembly and smaller than the previously reported estimate of
350–400 Mb.
The Tetraodon draft sequence has roughly 60-fold greater con-

Figure 1 The Tetraodon genome is composed of 21 chromosomes. Red areas indicate
the location of 5S and 28S ribosomal RNA gene arrays on chromosome 10 and
chromosome 15, respectively. Many chromosomes are subtelocentric; that is, they only
possess a very short heterochromatic arm. The extent of 39 sequence-based ultracontigs
that cover about 64% of their length is shown in blue. In addition, approximately 16% of
the genome is contained in another 89 ultracontigs that are not yet anchored on
chromosomes, and the remaining 20% of the genome is in 23,210 smaller scaffolds.

human (black triangles). d, The three major families of repeats in Tetraodon are not
distributed uniformly in the genome: long terminal repeat (LTR) and LINE elements (red
diamonds and green squares, respectively) concentrate in (G þ C)-rich regions and SINE
elements (blue circles) concentrate in (A þ T)-rich regions. In contrast, the distribution of
these elements is much more uniform in Takifugu (Supplementary Fig. S4).

tinuity at the level of N50 ultracontig size than the Takifugu draft
sequence (7.62 Mb versus 125 kb). Critically, the anchoring of the
assembly provides a comprehensive view of a ﬁsh genome sequence
organized in individual chromosomes.
Genome landscape
A consequence of the remarkably compact nature of the Tetraodon
genome is that its GþC content is much higher than in the larger
genomes of mammals. Although the GþC content is shifted
markedly, it still shows the same asymmetric bell-shaped distri-
bution with an excess of higher values as seen in human and mouse
(Fig. 2a). (GþC)-rich regions tend to be gene-rich in mammals, and
analysis of our data shows that this is also true for Tetraodon
(Fig. 2b, c). The Tetraodon genome thus cannot be considered as
a single homogeneous component but, as in mammals, it is a mosaic
of relatively gene-rich and gene-poor regions.
Transposable elements are very rare in the Tetraodon genome12,13:
we estimate here that they do not exceed 4,000 copies; however, with
73 different types, they are richly represented (Supplementary Notes
and Supplementary Table SI3). In sharp contrast, the human and
mouse genomes contain only ,20 different types but are riddled
with millions of transposable element copies. One of the intriguing
features of the human genome is that the distribution of short
interspersed nucleotide elements (SINEs) is biased towards (GþC)-
rich regions, whereas long interspersed nucleotide elements
(LINEs) favour (AþT)-rich regions. In Tetraodon, these preferences
are precisely reverse: LINEs occur preferentially in (GþC)-rich
regions and SINEs in (AþT)-rich regions (Fig. 2d). The reason
for these differences is not clear.
The Tetraodon genome shows certain striking differences from
the previously reported Takifugu genome sequence. Takifugu con-
tains eightfold more copies of transposable elements4 than Tetra-
odon, which may contribute to its slightly larger genome size
(approximately 370 Mb; see Supplementary Information). More
surprisingly, the GþC content of Takifugu does not show the
characteristic asymmetry seen in mammals and in Tetraodon
(Fig. 2a) nor the biases in SINE and LINE distribution (Supplemen-
tary Fig. S4). Why would the (GþC)-rich component be lacking in
the Takifugu sequence, when this fraction is gene dense in mammals
and in Tetraodon? This cannot be ascribed to transposable elements,
which represent less than 5% of the assembly in both of these puffer
ﬁsh species. One possible explanation is that the (GþC)-rich
fraction exists in Takifugu, but was markedly under-represented as
a result of aspects of the cloning, sequencing or assembly process.
The fact that Tetraodon (GþC)-rich regions contain an excess of
genes with no apparent orthologues in the Takifugu genome sup-
ports this hypothesis. Indeed, the Tetraodon genome appears to
contain ,16.5% more coding exons than Takifugu (see below).
Tetraodon genes
Gene catalogue
The most prevalent features of the Tetraodon genome are protein-
coding genes, which span 40% of the assembly. We constructed a
catalogue of genes by adapting the GAZE14 computational frame-
work (Supplementary Fig. S5) in order to combine three types of
data: Tetraodon complementary DNA mapping, similarities to
human, mouse and Takifugu proteins and genomes, and ab initio
gene models (Supplementary Notes and Supplementary Tables SI4
and SI5).
The current Tetraodon catalogue is composed of 27,918 gene
models, with 6.9 coding exons per gene on average (7.3 including
untranslated regions (UTRs); Table 2). Assuming that ﬁsh and
mammal genes possess similar gene structures, this suggests that
some Tetraodon annotated genes are partial or fragmented because
human and mouse genes respectively show 8.7 and 8.4 coding exons
per gene2. Adjusting the gene count for such fragmentation (by
multiplying by 6.9/8.6) would yield an estimated gene count of
22,400 genes, whereas accounting for unsequenced regions of the
genome might increase the estimate slightly further. Although such

estimates are somewhat imprecise, it seems likely that Tetraodon has
between 20,000–25,000 protein coding genes.
The Tetraodon gene catalogue appears to be the most complete so
far for a ﬁsh, with coding exons and UTRs totalling ,36 Mb (,11%
of the genome; Table 2). The Takifugu paper4 reported an estimate of
35,180 genes, but it did not account for a high degree of fragmenta-
tion (,4.3 exons per gene model). More recent, unpublished
analyses have revised this number sharply downward (Table 2).
The human and Tetraodon genomes have a similar distribution of
exon sizes but markedly different distributions of intron size
(Supplementary Fig. S6a). Although neither genome seems to
tolerate introns below approximately 50–60 base pairs, Tetraodon
has accumulated a much higher frequency of introns at this lower
limit. Interestingly, this phenomenon is not uniform across the
genome: there is an excess of genes with many small introns
(Supplementary Fig. S6b), suggesting that intron sizes ﬂuctuate in
a regional fashion.
Proteome comparison between vertebrates
We examined in detail two gene families with unusual properties
that represent challenges for automatic annotation procedures and
have particular biological interest. The ﬁrst is the family of seleno-
proteins, where the UGA codon encodes a rare cysteine analogue
named selenocysteine (Sec) instead of signalling the end of trans-
lation as in all other genes15. We annotated 18 distinct families in
Tetraodon based on similarities with the 19 protein families known
in eukaryotes, and discovered a new selenoprotein that seems to be
restricted to the actinopterygians among vertebrates and does not
have a Cys counterpart in mammals. We also catalogued type I
helical cytokines and their receptors (HCRI), a group of genes that
were not found in the Takifugu genome4 because of their poor
sequence conservation, leading to the hypothesis that ﬁsh may not
possess this large family that includes hormones and interleukins.
Tetraodon, in fact, contains 30 genes encoding HCRIs with a typical
D200 domain (Supplementary Fig. S7) and represents all families
previously described in mammals16.
InterPro17 domains were annotated in protein sequences pre-
dicted in the Tetraodon, Takifugu, human, mouse and the urochor-
date Ciona intestinalis18 genome using InterProScan19. We did not
identify major differences between ﬁsh and mammal InterPro
families, except for a few striking cases (Table 3): (1) collagen
molecules are much more diverse in ﬁsh than in mammals, with
one Tetraodon gene containing 20 von Willebrand type A domains,
the largest number found so far in a single protein. (2) Some
domains associated with sodium transport are noticeably enriched
in ﬁshes and Ciona, perhaps a reﬂection of their adaptation to saline
aquatic environments that was lost in land vertebrates. (3) Purine
nucleosidases usually involved in the recovery of purine nucleosides
are more abundant in ﬁsh, including an allantoin pathway for
purine degradation that is present in Tetraodon and absent in
human. (4) Several hundred KRAB box transcriptional repressors
involved in chromatin-mediated gene regulation exist in mammals
and are totally absent in ﬁsh. (5) Proteins involved in general gene
regulation are more abundant in vertebrates than in Ciona.
Protein annotation with gene ontology (GO) classiﬁcations20
shows only subtle differences between ﬁsh and mammals, as was
already observed between human and mouse2. The largest differ-
ences between species are seen with the GO classiﬁcation in
molecular functions (Supplementary Fig. S9). Interestingly, the
two puffer ﬁsh and Ciona often vary together, showing for instance
a higher frequency of enzymatic and transporter functions, and a
lower frequency of signal transducer and structural molecules than
both mammals (human and mouse). These global observations are
difﬁcult to relate to evolutionary or physiological mechanisms but
provide a framework to understand the emergence or decline of
molecular functions in vertebrates.
Number of genes in mammals and teleosts
The total amount of coding sequence conserved between the two
ﬁsh and the two mammalian genomes provides a measure of their
respective coding capacity. The Exoﬁsh method6 is well suited to
measure this, because it translates entire genomes in all six frames
and identiﬁes conserved coding regions (ecores) with a high
speciﬁcity and independently of prior genome annotation
(Table 4; see also Supplementary Information). The four vertebrate
genomes contain remarkably similar numbers of ecores, apart from
minor differences attributable to varying degrees of sequence
completion. This suggests that they possess fairly similar numbers
of genes. In fact, the gene count may be slightly less in mammals
than in ﬁsh because the proportion of ecores corresponding to
pseudogenes is higher in mammals21.
The human ecores can be used to search for previously unrecog-
nized human genes. The discovery of new human genes is becoming
an increasingly rare event, given the scale and intensity of inter-
national efforts to annotate the genome by systematic annotation
pipelines and by human experts. Roughly 14,500 human ecores

conserved with Tetraodon sequences do not overlap any ‘known’
features (genes or pseudogenes) in the human genome. Using these
as anchors for local gene identiﬁcation using the GAZE program, we
identiﬁed 904 novel human gene predictions. Of these, 63% are also
supported by expressed sequence tag (EST) data (from human or
other species) and 50% contain predicted InterPro protein domains
(Supplementary Table SI9). The most convincing evidence support-
ing these gene predictions is that they are strongly enriched on
chromosomes that have not yet been annotated by human experts
(Supplementary Table SI10). The novel gene predictions have
relatively small size (average coding sequence (CDS) of 469 bp),
which may have caused them to be eliminated by systematic
annotation procedures. They provide a rich resource to help
complete the human gene catalogue.
Tetraodon gene evolution
We measured rates of sequence divergence between ﬁsh and
mammals to estimate the relative speed with which functional
and non-functional sequences evolve in these lineages. We used
fourfold degenerate (4D) site substitutions in orthologous proteins
as a proxy for neutral nucleotide mutations, an approach that has
been shown to be robust across entire genomes2. To optimize
further the selection of sites used for comparison, we only con-
sidered the 5,802 proteins that are identiﬁed as orthologues in all
pairwise comparisons between human, mouse, Tetraodon and
Takifugu. The average neutral nucleotide substitution rate, inferred
using the REV model22,23, shows that the divergence between
Tetraodon and Takifugu is about twice as fast per year as between
human and mouse (Table 5), or between mouse and rat3.
We were interested to see whether this higher mutation rate is also
seen in protein sequences. Pairwise comparison of all possible
combinations of the 5,802 four-way orthologous proteins clearly
indicates that proteins between the two puffer ﬁsh are more
divergent than between the two mammals, despite the shorter
evolutionary time that has elapsed (Fig. 3). This is conﬁrmed by
the fact that the average frequency of non-synonymous mutations
(leading to an amino acid change, Ka) between C. intestinalis and
human proteins is lower than between Ciona and Tetraodon (see
Methods).
Independent of the overall rate of change, the ratio of non-
synonymous to synonymous changes (Ka/Ks ratio) is much higher
between the two puffer ﬁsh than between human and mouse
(Supplementary Table SI11 and Supplementary Information),
suggesting that protein evolution is proceeding more rapidly
along the puffer ﬁsh lineage. The reasons for this faster tempo of
protein change are unknown, although it is likely to be positively
correlated with the higher rate of neutral mutation.
Genome evolution
Genome-wide sequence provides a rare opportunity to address key
evolutionary questions in a global fashion, circumventing biases
due to small sequence and gene samples. In this respect, the
combination of long-range linkage in the Tetraodon sequence and
its evolutionary divergence from the mammalian lineage at 450 Myr
ago makes it possible to explore overall genome evolution in the
vertebrate clade.
Evidence for whole-genome duplication
The occurrence of WGD in the ray-ﬁnned ﬁsh lineage is a hotly
debated question due both to the cataclysmic nature of such an event
and to the difﬁculty in establishing that it actually occurred24–26.
Figure 3 Distribution of the per cent identity between pairs of orthologous protein sets.
Comparisons were performed with 2,289 proteins that are orthologous between the
chordate C. intestinalis and all four vertebrates—Tetraodon, Takifugu, human and mouse
(asterisks)—and with 5,802 proteins orthologous between all four vertebrates only,
between ﬁsh and mammals (triangles) or between the two ﬁsh (circles), and between the
two mammals (squares). As expected, all vertebrates show the same distribution proﬁle
compared to Ciona and both ﬁsh show the same distribution proﬁle compared to
mammals. Surprisingly, the distribution proﬁle of the comparison between the two ﬁsh
and between the two mammals is also very similar, despite the much shorter evolutionary
time since the tetraodontiform radiation.

Deﬁnitive proof of WGD requires identifying certain distinctive
signatures in long-range genome organization, which has pre-
viously been impossible to address with the data available.
It is expected that after WGD the resulting polyploid genome
gradually returns to a diploid state through extensive gene deletion,
with only a small proportion of duplicated copies ultimately
retained as sources of functional innovation26. Paralogous chromo-
somes will thus each retain only a small subset of their initially
common gene complement and then will be broken into smaller
segments by genomic rearrangements. WGD will thus leave two
distinctive signs for considerable periods before eventually fading.
The ﬁrst distinctive sign is duplicated genes on paralogous
chromosomes. In the absence of chromosomal rearrangement it
would be simple to recognize two paralogous chromosomes arising
from a WGD from the genome-wide distribution of duplicate genes:
the chromosomes would each contain one member from many
duplicated gene pairs occurring in the same order along their length.
The difﬁculty is that this neat picture will eventually be blurred
by interchromosomal rearrangement, which will disrupt the 1:1
correspondence between chromosomes, and intrachromosomal
rearrangement,
which
will
disrupt
gene
ordering
along
chromosomes.
We analysed the genome-wide distribution of duplicated gene
pairs to see whether a strong correspondence between chromo-
somes could be detected. We identiﬁed 1,078 and 995 pairs of
duplicated genes in the Tetraodon and Takifugu genomes, respect-
ively, using conservative criteria (see Supplementary Information).
On the basis of the frequencies of silent mutations (Ks) between
copies, ,75% are ‘ancient’ duplications that arose before the
Tetraodon–Takifugu speciation (Fig. 4a).
The chromosomal distribution of these ancient duplicates fol-
lows a striking pattern characteristic of a WGD. Genes on one
chromosome segment have a strong tendency to possess duplicate
copies on a single other chromosome (Fig. 4b). The correspondence
is not a perfect 1:1 match owing to interchromosomal exchange, but
it is vastly stronger than expected by chance (Supplementary Table
SI12). As expected from a WGD, all chromosomes are involved.
Remarkably, some duplicate chromosome pairs such as Tetraodon
chromosome 9 (Tni9) and Tni11 have remained largely undis-
turbed by chromosome translocations since the duplication event.
In other cases, one chromosome has links to two or three others,
suggestive of either fusion or fragmentation (for example, Tni13
matches Tni5 and Tni19).
The second distinctive sign, which is an even more powerful
signature of genome duplication, comes from comparison with a
related species carrying a genome that did not undergo the WGD.
Such a comparison was recently used to prove the existence of an
ancient WGD in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on
comparison with a second yeast species Kluyveromyces waltii that
diverged before the WGD27,28. Although two ancient paralogous
regions typically retained only a few genes in common, they could
be readily recognized because they showed a characteristic 2:1
mapping with interleaving; that is, they both showed conserved
synteny and local order to the same region of the K. waltii genome
with the S. cerevisiae genes interleaving in alternating stretches. Such
regions were called blocks of DCS (doubly conserved synteny).
Whereas the ﬁrst distinctive sign of WGD depends only on a

minority of duplicated genes, the DCS signature considers all genes
for which orthologues can be found in the related species.
We used 6,684 Tetraodon genes localized on individual chromo-
somes that possess an orthologue in either human or mouse to
create a high-resolution synteny map (Fig. 5 and Supplementary
Fig. S11, respectively). The map contains 900 syntenic groups
composed of at least two consecutive genes (average 6.1; maximum
55) having orthologues on the same human chromosome; the
syntenic groups include 76% of Tetraodon–human orthologues.
The synteny map with mouse contains 1,011 syntenic groups,
probably reﬂecting the higher degree of chromosomal rearrange-
ment in the rodent lineage2.
The synteny map typically associates two regions in Tetraodon
with one region in human. Using precise criteria (see Methods) we
deﬁned DCS blocks for Tetraodon relative to human; in contrast to
the yeast study, strict conservation of gene order within DCSs was
not required. Notably, most (79.6%) orthologous genes in syntenic
groups can be assigned to 90 DCS blocks (Fig. 6). As in S. cerevisiae27,
we see the distinctive interleaving pattern expected from WGD
followed by massive gene loss. Analysis of the interleaving pattern
shows that the gene loss occurred through many small deletions in a
balanced fashion over the two Tetraodon sister chromosomes
(average balance 42% and 58% of retention; Supplementary
Information); this is consistent with the results in yeast.
These two analyses provide deﬁnitive evidence that the Tetraodon
genome underwent a WGD sometime after its divergence from the
mammalian lineage. The ﬁrst test used only the ,3% of genes that
represent duplicated gene pairs retained from the WGD. The second
test used the pattern of 2:1 mapping with interleaving involving
,80% of orthologues between Tetraodon and human.

duplication in Tetraodon. Blocks of synteny along human chromosomes map to two (or
three) Tetraodon chromosomes in an interleaving pattern. Small boxes represent groups
of syntenic orthologous genes enclosed in larger boxes that deﬁne the boundaries of 110

Figure 8 Reconstructing ancient genome rearrangements. Model of chromosome
duplication followed by the four simplest chromosome rearrangements: (1) no
rearrangement; (2) two different duplicate copies fused recently; (3) two different
duplicate copies fused early after the duplication; (4) a duplicate chromosome fragmented
very recently. In each model, the distribution of human orthologues from a given
chromosomal region on two or three duplicate Tetraodon chromosomal regions is
expected to be different (each dot is an orthologue, positioned in the human genome on
the vertical axis and in the Tetraodon genome on the horizontal axis). The distinction
between early or late events follows the assumption that intrachromosomal shufﬂing
progressively redistributes genes over a given chromosome. A recent fusion would thus
bring together two sets of genes that appear compartmented on their respective
segments, whereas an ancient fusion shows the same pattern except that genes have
been redistributed over the length of the fused chromosome. It should be noted that a ﬁfth
case exists, consisting of a chromosome break early after duplication but it is not
represented here. The lower panel shows excerpts of data illustrating the four types of
event. The complete Oxford grid is shown in Supplementary Fig. SI12.

identiﬁed on the human genome are grouped according to their composition in terms of

blocks. The order of DCSs within an ancestral chromosome is arbitrary. The 20 blocks
denoted by the letters U, V, W and Z (Supplementary Information) could not be assigned to
an ancestral chromosome because each has a unique composition, probably due to
rearrangements in the human or Tetraodon genome. Colour codes are as in Fig. 6.

The presence of supernumerary HOX clusters in zebraﬁsh7,
Tetraodon (Fig. S8) and many other percomorphs29 but not in the
bichir Polypterus senegalus30 indicates that the event has affected
most teleosts but not all actinopterygians. This timing early in the
teleost lineage is in agreement with recent evolutionary analyses in
Takifugu that estimated the divergence time for most duplicated
gene pairs at ,320–350 Myr ago31,32.
The analyses above also shed light on the rate of intra- and
interchromosomal exchange. The synteny analysis shows extensive
syntenic segments in which gene content has been well preserved
but gene order has been extensively scrambled (striking examples
include conserved synteny of Tni20 with human chromosome 4q
(Hsa4q) and Tni1 with HsaXq); this is consistent with observations
in zebraﬁsh33. The duplication analysis within Tetraodon also shows
that the chromosomal correspondence of duplicated gene pairs has
been extensively preserved, whereas local gene order has been
largely scrambled. Both analyses thus indicate that a relatively
high degree of intrachromosomal rearrangement and a relatively
low degree of interchromosomal exchange have taken place in the
Tetraodon lineage.
Figure 10 Proposed model for the distribution of ancestral chromosome segments in the
human and the Tetraodon genomes. The composition of Tetraodon chromosomes is
based on their duplication pattern (Fig. 9), whereas the composition of human
chromosomes is based on the distribution of orthologues of Tetraodon genes (Fig. 6). A
vertical line in Tetraodon chromosomes denotes regions where sequence has not yet been
assigned. With 90 blocks in human compared with 44 in Tetraodon, the complexity of the
mosaic of ancestral segments in human chromosomes underlines the higher frequency of
rearrangements to which they were submitted during the same evolutionary period.
Figure 9 Model for the reconstruction of an ancestral bony vertebrate karyotype
comprising 12 chromosomes, based on the pairing information provided by duplicated
Tetraodon chromosomes showing interleaved patterns on human chromosomes. The ten
major rearrangements (two ancient fusions, three recent fusions, one ancient and one
recent ﬁssion, and three ancient translocations) are deduced by ﬁtting the distribution of
orthologues to the four simple theoretical models of chromosome evolution. The order
between events is arbitrary although the approximate timeline differentiates between
ancient and recent events respectively before and after the dashed line. Arrowheads point
to the direction of three ancient translocations.

Ancestral genome of bony vertebrates
We then sought to use the correspondence between the Tetraodon
and human genomes to attempt to reconstruct the karyotype of
their osteichthyan (bony vertebrate) ancestor. The DCS blocks
deﬁne Tetraodon regions that arose from duplication of a common
ancestral region. Notably, the DCS blocks largely fall into 12 simple
patterns: eight cases involving the interleaving of two current
Tetraodon chromosomes and four cases involving three current
Tetraodon chromosomes (Fig. 7 and Table 6). The ﬁrst group
represents cases in which the ancestral chromosomes have remained
largely untouched by interchromosomal exchange; the second
group represents cases in which one major translocation has
occurred.
The distribution of Tetraodon orthologues in the human genome
(shown as an Oxford grid in Supplementary Fig. S12) provides a
detailed record that can be used to partially reconstruct the history
of rearrangements in both lineages. We considered the expected
distribution resulting from various types of interchromosomal
rearrangements, assuming a relatively high degree of intrachromo-
somal shufﬂing (Fig. 8; see also Supplementary Information).
We found that only ten large-scale interchromosomal events sufﬁce
to largely explain the data, connecting an ancestral vertebrate
karyotype of 12 chromosomes to the modern Tetraodon genome
of 21 chromosomes (Fig. 9). Eleven of the Tetraodon chromosomes
appear to have undergone no major interchromosomal rearrange-
ment. For example, 13 DCS blocks in human are composed of
interleaved syntenic groups mapping to Tni9 and Tni11, which are
presumed to be derived from a common ancestral chromosome
denoted chromosome K (AncK; Fig. 7). The orthologue distri-
bution between the two chromosomes (Fig. 8) conﬁrms that they
derive by duplication from AncK (Fig. 9). In a more complex case,
Tni13 is systematically interleaved with Tni5 (AncE) or Tni19
(AncF), but Tni5 and Tni19 are never interleaved together; the
orthologue distribution among the three chromosomes (Fig. 8)
implies that the duplication partners of Tni5 and Tni19 fused soon
after the WGD to give rise to Tni13 (Fig. 9). The overall model is
consistent with a complete WGD, in that it accounts for all
Tetraodon chromosomes.
Several lines of evidence support the historical reconstitution
presented here. First, the pairing of Tetraodon chromosomes agrees
with the independently derived distribution of duplicated genes in
the genome (Fig. 4b). Second, centric fusions of the three largest
chromosomes are consistent with cytogenetic studies34, and the
recent timing of the fusion leading to Tni1 is supported by
cytogenetic studies showing its absence in Takifugu35. Third, the
modal value for the haploid number of chromosomes in teleosts is
24 (refs 36–38), consistent with a WGD of an ancestral genome
composed of 12 chromosomes.
The analysis also sheds light on genome evolution in the human
lineage, with the interleaving patterns on human chromosomes
delineating the mosaic of ancestral segments in the human genome
(Figs 6 and 10). The results are consistent with and extend several
known cases of rearrangements in the human lineage. The model
correctly shows the recent fusion of two primate chromosomes
leading to Hsa2 (ref. 39) occurring at the junction between two
ancestral segments (D2 and D3; Fig. 6) in 2q13.2-2q14.1. It shows
HsaXp and HsaXq to be of different origins (corresponding to
AncD and AncH, respectively), consistent with the fact that HsaXp
is known to be absent in non-placental mammals40. The map
indicates that most of HsaXq and Hsa5q were once part of the
same chromosome, but that the tip of HsaXq (Xq28) originates
from a different ancestral segment and is thus a later addition. Some
pairs of human chromosomes show similar or identical compo-
sitions, suggesting that they derived by ﬁssion from the same
ancestral chromosome, with examples being Hsa13–Hsa21 and
Hsa12–Hsa22; the latter case is consistent with cytogenetic studies
showing that a ﬁssion occurred in the primate lineage41.
The results show a major difference in the evolutionary forces
shaping the Tetraodon and the human genomes (Fig. 10). Whereas
11 Tetraodon chromosomes did not undergo interchromosomal
exchange over 450 Myr, only one human chromosome (Hsa14) was
similarly undisturbed. Hsa7 is an extreme case, with contributions
from six ancestral chromosomes. A possible explanation for the
difference may be the massive integration of transposable elements
in the human genome. The presence of transposable elements may
increase the overall frequency of chromosome breaks, as well as the
likelihood that a chromosome break fails to disrupt a gene (by
increasing the size of intergenic intervals). It will be interesting to
see whether teleosts that carry many more transposable elements
(such as zebraﬁsh) show a higher frequency of interchromosomal
exchanges.
Conclusion
The purpose of sequencing the Tetraodon genome was to use
comparative analysis to illuminate the human genome in particular
and vertebrate genomes in general. The Tetraodon sequence, which
has been made freely available during the course of this project, has
already had a major impact on human gene annotation. It has
provided the ﬁrst clear evidence of a sharply lower human gene
count6 and has been used in the annotation of several human
chromosomes42–45. Here, we show that it suggests an additional
,900 predicted genes in the human genome. Given its compact size,
the Tetraodon genome will probably also prove valuable in identify-
ing key conserved regulatory features in intergenic and intronic
regions.
In addition, the Tetraodon genome provides fundamental insight
into genome evolution in the vertebrate lineage. First, the analysis
here shows that Tetraodon is the descendant of an ancient WGD
that most probably affected all teleosts. Together with the recent
demonstration of an ancient WGD in the yeast lineage, this suggests
that WGD followed by massive gene loss may be an extremely
important mechanism for eukaryote genome evolution—perhaps
because it allows for the neofunctionalization of entire pathways
rather than simply individual genes. There remains a ﬁerce debate
about whether one or more earlier WGD events occurred in early
vertebrate evolution25,46–50, with no direct and conclusive evidence
found so far51,52. The examples of yeast and Tetraodon show that
ultimate proof will probably best come from the sequence of a
related non-duplicated species. An obvious candidate is amphioxus,
as its non-duplicated status is supported by the presence of
many single-copy genes (including one HOX cluster53) instead of
two or more in vertebrates, and it is among our closest non-
vertebrate relatives based on anatomical and evolutionary
observations.
Second, the remarkable preservation of the Tetraodon genome
after WGD makes it possible to infer the history of vertebrate
chromosome evolution. The model suggests that the ancestral
vertebrate genome was comprised of 12 chromosomes, was com-
pact, and contained not signiﬁcantly fewer genes than modern
vertebrates (inasmuch as the WGD and subsequent massive gene
loss resulted in only a tiny fraction of duplicate genes being
retained). The explosion of transposable elements in the mamma-
lian lineage, subsequent to divergence from the teleost lineage, may
have provided the conditions for increased interchromosomal
rearrangements in mammals; in contrast, the Tetraodon genome
underwent much less interchromosomal rearrangement.
With the availability of additional vertebrate genomes (dog,
marsupial, chicken, medaka, zebraﬁsh and frog are underway), it
will be possible to explore intermediate nodes such as the last
common ancestor of amniotes, of sarcopterygians and of actinop-
terygians, and to gain an increasingly clearer picture of the early
vertebrate ancestor. Because the early vertebrate genome is ‘closer’
to current invertebrates, this should in turn facilitate comparison
between vertebrate and invertebrate evolution.

Methods
Sequencing, assembly and data access
Sequencing was performed as described previously for Genoscope54 and the Broad
Institute1,2. Approximately 4.2 million plasmid reads were cloned and sequenced from
DNA extracted from two wild Tetraodon ﬁsh and passed extensive checks for quality
and source, representing approximately 8.3-fold sequence coverage of the Tetraodon
genome. To alleviate problems due to polymorphism, the assembly proceeded in four
stages: (1) reads from a single ﬁsh were assembled by Arachne as described
previously10,11; (2) reads from the second individual were added to increase sequencing
depth; (3) scaffolds were constructed using plasmid and BAC paired reads; and (4)
contigs from a separate assembly combining both individuals were added if they did not
overlap with the ﬁrst assembly. The ﬁnal assembly can be downloaded from the EMBL/
GenBank/DDBJ databases under accession number CAAE01000000. Full-length
Tetraodon cDNAs have been submitted under accession numbers CR631133–CR735083.
Ultracontigs organized in chromosomes are available from http://www.genoscope.org/
tetraodon. This site also contains an annotation browser and further information on
the project.
Gene annotation
Protein-coding genes were predicted by combining three types of information: alignments
with proteins and genomic DNA from other species, Tetraodon cDNAs, and ab initio
models. All alignments with genomic DNA from human and mouse were performed with
Exoﬁsh as described previously6, whereas a new Exoﬁsh method was developed to align
Takifugu genomic DNA. Proteins predicted from human and mouse were also matched
using Exoﬁsh and a selected subset was then aligned using Genewise. The integration of
these data sources was performed with GAZE14. A speciﬁc GAZE automaton was designed,
and parameters were adjusted on a training set of 184 manually annotated Tetraodon
genes. See Supplementary Information for details.
Evolution of coding and non-coding DNA
To identify orthologous genes between human, mouse, Tetraodon, Takifugu and Ciona,
their predicted proteomes were compared using the Smith–Waterman algorithm and
reciprocal best matches were considered as orthologous genes between two species.
However, only those genes that were reciprocal best matches between four or ﬁve species,
and only sites that were aligned between the four or ﬁve genes, were further considered to
compute the percentage identity, Ka, Ks and fourfold degenerate sites by the PBL
method applying Kimura’s two-parameter model55–57. See Supplementary Information for
details.
Genome duplication
A core set of Tetraodon duplicated genes was identiﬁed by an all-against-all comparison
of Tetraodon predicted protein using Exoﬁsh. Only proteins that matched a single other
protein by reciprocal best match were considered further and realigned by the Smith–
Waterman algorithm to compute Ka and Ks values. Duplicates with a Ks . 0.35 (the
amount of neutral substitution since the Tetraodon–Takifugu divergence) were
considered ‘ancient’ and used to calculate P-values for chromosome pairing
(Supplementary Table SI12). Rules for classifying alternating patterns of syntenic
groups along human chromosomes in DCS blocks included the following criteria:
number of genes in syntenic groups, number of syntenic groups in the DCS region,
number of Tetraodon chromosomes that alternate, and number of times the same
combination of Tetraodon chromosomes occur in the human genome. See
Supplementary Information for details.
Ancestral genome reconstruction
One category of DCS with the following deﬁnition encompassed most orthologues:
“alternating series of i syntenic groups that belong to two (i . ¼ 2) or three (i . ¼ 3)
Tetraodon chromosomes. The series may only be interrupted by groups from categories
‘unassigned singletons’ or ‘background singletons’. A given combination of two or three
Tetraodon chromosomes must appear at least twice in the human genome”. These DCS
blocks showed 12 recurring combinations of Tetraodon chromosomes, and were thus
further classiﬁed in 12 groups labelled A to L. Each of the 12 groups, consisting of at least
two DCS blocks with the same combination of alternating Tetraodon chromosomes,
represents a proto-chromosome from the ancestral bony vertebrate (Osteichthyes). A
model was then designed to account for the possible fates of chromosomes after
duplication of the ancestral genome in the teleost lineage (Fig. 8). The model only deals
with orthologous gene distribution between two genomes. It is simply based on the
postulate that interchromosomal shufﬂing of genes within a genome increases with time,
which is a measure to distinguish between ancient and recent events (for example,
chromosome fusions or ﬁssions). The two-dimensional distribution of 7,903 Tetraodon–
human orthologues (Oxford Grid, Supplementary Fig. S12) was then confronted to the
model and all 21 Tetraodon chromosomes could be grouped in pairs or triplets and
assigned to a given type of event. See Supplementary Information for details.
