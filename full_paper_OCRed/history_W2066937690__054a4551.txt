E
merging infections (EIs) can be defined as
“infections that have newly appeared in a popu-
lation or have existed previously but are rapidly
increasing in incidence or geographic range”1.
EIs have shaped the course of human history and
have caused incalculable misery and death. In 1981, a new
disease — acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)
— was first recognized. As a global killer, AIDS now threat-
ens to surpass the Black Death of the fourteenth century
and the 1918–1920 influenza pandemic, each of which
killed at least 50 million people2,3. Of the ‘newly emerging’
and ‘re-emerging/resurging’ diseases that have followed the
appearance of AIDS (Fig. 1), some have been minor curiosi-
ties, such as the 2003 cases of monkeypox imported into the
United States4, whereas others, such as severe acute respira-
tory syndrome (SARS), which emerged in the same year5,
have had a worldwide impact. The 2001 anthrax bioterror-
ist attack in the United States6 falls into a third category:
‘deliberately emerging’ diseases. EIs can be expected to
remain a considerable challenge for the foreseeable future.
Here we examine the nature and scope of emerging and re-
emerging microbial threats, and consider methods for their
control. We emphasize that emergence results from dynamic
interactions between rapidly evolving infectious agents and
changes in the environment and in host behaviour that
provide such agents with favourable new ecological niches.
Global burden of infectious diseases
About 15 million (>25%) of 57 million annual deaths
worldwide are estimated to be related directly to infectious
diseases; this figure does not include the additional millions
of deaths that occur as a consequence of past infections (for
example, streptococcal rheumatic heart disease), or because
of complications associated with chronic infections, such as
liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma in people infected
with hepatitis B or C viruses7(Fig. 2).
The burden of morbidity (ill health) and mortality asso-
ciated with infectious diseases falls most heavily on people
in developing countries8, and particularly on infants and
children (about three million children die each year from
malaria and diarrhoeal diseases alone7). In developed
nations, infectious disease mortality disproportionately
affects indigenous and disadvantaged minorities9.
Emerging infections in historical context
EIs have been familiar threats since ancient times. They
were once identified by terms such as ´ (loimos)10,
and later as ‘pestilences’, ‘pestes’, ‘pests’ and ‘plagues’. Many
examples can be cited in addition to the Black Death and
the 1918 influenza pandemic, such as certain biblical
pharaonic plagues and the unidentified Plague of Athens,
which heralded the end of Greece’s Golden Age11. The Age
of Discovery, starting in the fifteenth century, was a partic-
ularly disastrous period with regard to the spread of infec-
tious diseases. Importation of smallpox into Mexico caused
10–15 million deaths in 1520–1521, effectively ending Aztec
civilization12,13. Other Amerindian and Pacific civilizations
were destroyed by imported smallpox and measles13–17.
Historians have referred to these events as apocalypses16and
even as genocide15.
For centuries, mankind seemed helpless against these
sudden epidemics. But the establishment of the germ theory
and the identification of specific microbes as the causative
agents of a wide variety of infectious diseases18–20led to enor-
mous progress, notably the development of vaccines and
ultimately of antimicrobials20. In fact, the era of the identifi-
cation of microbes had barely begun18when optimists at the
end of the nineteenth century predicted the eradication of
infectious diseases21. By the 1950s, which witnessed the wide-
spread use of penicillin, the development of polio vaccines
and the discovery of drugs for tuberculosis, complacency had
set in22, and in 1967, the US Surgeon General stated that “the
war against infectious diseases has been won”23.
Some experts remained sceptical, aware of recurrent
lessons from history. They were less persuaded by successes
than alarmed by failures such as the lack of progress against
infections in the developing world and the global spread of
antimicrobial resistance. Richard Krause, then the director
of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious 
Diseases, warned in 1981 (ref. 24) that microbial diversity
and evolutionary vigour were still dynamic forces threat-
ening mankind. As Krause was completing his book The
Restless Tide 24, AIDS — one of history’s most devastating
pandemics — was already insidiously emerging. The
emergence of AIDS led to renewed appreciation of the
inevitability and consequences of the emergence of infec-
tious diseases25–31. In the past 25 years, some of the factors
that resulted in AIDS have also led to re-emergences of
historically important diseases such as cholera, diphtheria,
trench fever and plague. Many re-emergences have been
catalysed by wars, loss of social cohesion, and natural
disasters such as earthquakes and floods, indicating the
importance not only of microbial and viral factors, but also
of social and environmental determinants25–31.
The challenge of emerging and 
re-emerging infectious diseases

Infectious diseases have for centuries ranked with wars and famine as major challenges to human progress
and survival. They remain among the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Against a constant
background of established infections, epidemics of new and old infectious diseases periodically emerge,
greatly magnifying the global burden of infections. Studies of these emerging infections reveal the
evolutionary properties of pathogenic microorganisms and the dynamic relationships between
microorganisms, their hosts and the environment.

Newly emerging and newly recognized infections
The classification of EIs as ‘newly emerging’, ‘re-emerging/resurging’
or ‘deliberately emerging’ is useful because the underlying causes of
emergence and the optimal prevention or control responses fre-
quently differ between the groups. Newly emerging infections are
those that have not previously been recognized in man. Many
diverse factors contribute to their emergences (see Box 1); these
include microbial genetic mutation and viral genetic recombination
or reassortment, changes in populations of reservoir hosts or inter-
mediate insect vectors, microbial switching from animal to human
hosts, human behavioural changes (notably human movement and
urbanization), and environmental factors. These numerous micro-
bial, host and environmental factors interact to create opportunities
for infectious agents to evolve into new ecological niches, reach and
adapt to new hosts, and spread more easily between them.
The AIDS model
Any discussion of recent EIs must begin with the human immuno-
deficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS. HIV has so far infected
more than 60 million people worldwide33. Before jumping to humans
an estimated 60–70 years ago34, perhaps as a consequence of the con-
sumption of ‘bush meat’ from non-human primates, HIV-1 and
HIV-2 had ample opportunity to evolve in hosts that were genetically
similar to man (the chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes, and the sooty
mangabey, Cercocebus atys). But HIV/AIDS might never have
emerged had it not been for disruptions in the economic and social
infrastructure in post-colonial sub-Saharan Africa. Increased travel,
the movement of rural populations to large cities, urban poverty and
a weakening of family structure all promoted sexual practices, such as
promiscuity and prostitution, that facilitate HIV transmission34–37.
Such complex interactions between infectious agents, hosts and the
environment are not unique to the epidemiology of HIV/AIDS. The
examples cited below further illustrate how changes in population
density, human movements and the environment interact to create
ecological niches that facilitate microbial or viral adaptation.
Dead-end transmission of zoonotic and vector-borne diseases
Some infectious agents that have adapted to non-human hosts can
jump to humans but, unlike HIV, are not generally transmitted from
person to person, achieving only ‘dead end’ transmission. Infections
in animals that are transmitted to humans (zoonoses), and those
transmitted from one vertebrate to another by an arthropod vector
(vector-borne diseases), have repeatedly been identified as ranking
among the most important EIs25,26. Examples include the arenavirus
haemorrhagic fevers (Argentine, Bolivian, Venezuelan and Lassa
haemorrhagic fevers) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS).
Viruses in these groups have co-evolved with specific rodent species
whose contact with humans has increased as a result of modern
environmental and human behavioural factors. Farming, keeping
domestic pets, hunting and camping, deforestation and other types
of habitat destruction all create new opportunities for such infectious
agents to invade human hosts25–31. The first epidemic of HPS, detected
in the southwestern region of the United States in 1993 (ref. 38),
resulted from population booms of the deer mouse Peromyscus
maniculatis, in turn caused by climate-related and recurrent prolif-
eration of rodent food sources. Increased rodent populations and
eventual shortages of food drove expanded deer mouse populations
into homes, exposing people to virus-containing droppings. The
1998–1999 Malaysian Nipah virus epidemic39 further illustrates the
influence of human behaviours and environmental perturbations
on newly emerging human infections. Pigs crammed together in
pens located in or near orchards attracted fruit bats whose normal
habitats had been destroyed by deforestation and whose droppings
contained the then-unknown paramyxovirus. Virus aerosolization
caused infection of pigs, with overcrowding leading to explosive
transmission rates and ultimately to infections in pig handlers.
Variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (vCJD) is another example of a
zoonotic disease emerging in humans. vCJD is caused by the human-
adapted form of the prion associated with the emerging epizootic
(large-scale animal outbreak) of bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE)40, commonly known as mad cow disease. The ongoing BSE

epizootic/vCJD epidemic, primarily affecting Great Britain, probably
resulted from the now-abandoned practice of supplementing cattle
feed with the pulverized meat and bones of previously slaughtered
cattle. BSE itself is suspected to have emerged because of even earlier
use of cattle feed containing the agent of sheep scrapie, a prion disease
recognized by farmers more than 250 years ago41. Alarmingly, the new
BSE prion has become uncharacteristically promiscuous: unlike most
known prions, it readily infects multiple species in addition to humans.
This suggests the possibility of further emerging diseases associated
with prions with currently unknown transmissibility to humans40. The
recent reports of variant strains of the BSE prion42suggest that the BSE
agent could be a more serious threat than other animal prions.
Environmentally persistent organisms
Infectious agents indirectly transmitted to or between humans by way
of human-modified environments account for other emerging
zoonoses, as well as certain non-zoonotic diseases, which are dis-
cussed below. For example, legionnaires’ disease, first identified in
1976, is caused by Legionella pneumophila, whose emergence as a
human pathogen might not have occurred were it not for the environ-
mental niche provided by air-conditioning systems26. Campylobacter
jejuni and Shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli (E. coli O157:H7
and other agents of haemolytic–uraemic syndrome) infect agricul-
tural animals, gaining access to humans through food, milk, water or
direct animal contact. Other enteric pathogens, such as the vibrios
causing classical cholera (re-emerging; see below) and serogroup
O139 cholera, and the zoonotic protozoa Cryptosporidium parvum
and Cyclospora cayetanensis26, seem to have come from environ-
mental or animal organisms that have adapted to human-to-human
‘faecal–oral’ transmission through water.
Old microbes cause new diseases
Some EIs come from microorganisms that once caused familiar
diseases, but which now cause new or previously uncommon diseases.
Streptococcus pyogenescaused a fatal pandemic of scarlet and puerperal
fevers between 1830 and 1900 (ref. 44). Scarlet fever, then the leading
cause of death in children, is now rare, but has been largely supple-
mented by other streptococcal complications such as streptococcal
toxic shock syndrome, necrotizing fasciitis and re-emergent
rheumatic fever45. When new microbes are discovered, their emer-
gences as disease-causing pathogens may be delayed. For example, in
1883, Robert Koch was unable to show that the newly discovered
Koch–Weeks bacillus caused serious disease. More than a century
later, a fatal EI dubbed Brazilian purpuric fever was linked to virulent
clonal variants of Haemophilus influenzae biogroup aegyptius (the
Koch–Weeks bacillus)46. Although the bases of emergences of new
and more severe diseases caused by S. pyogenes and H. influenzae
biogroup aegyptius are not fully known, in both cases complex
microbial genetic events are suspected. The distinctive clonal variants
associated with severe H. influenzae biogroup aegyptius disease have
been shown by PCR (polymerase chain reaction)-based subtractive
genome hybridization to contain not only a unique plasmid, but
also unique chromosomal regions, some of which are encoded by
bacteriophages47. This research has narrowed the search for viru-
lence determinants to unique proteins, some of which may have
been acquired from other organisms by horizontal gene transfer.
Streptococcus pyogenes has been studied more extensively, but the
basis of severe disease emergence seems to be more complex than for
H. influenzae biogroup aegyptius. Many factors associated with
streptococcal virulence have been identified in strains bearing the M1
surface protein as well as in other M protein strains, among them
bacteriophage-encoded superantigen toxins and a protein known as
sic (streptococcal inhibitor of complement), which seems to be
strongly selected by human host mucosal factors. Several lines of evi-
dence suggest that changes in streptococcal virulence reflect genetic
changes associated with phage integration, large-scale chromosomal
rearrangements and possibly the shuffling of virulence cassettes
(clusters of genes responsible for pathogenicity), followed by rapid
human spread and immune selection48,49.
Microbial agents and chronic diseases
Infectious agents that are associated with chronic diseases are one of
the most challenging categories of newly emerging (or at least newly
appreciated) infections. Examples include the associations of hepatitis
B and C with chronic liver damage and hepatocellular carcinoma, of
certain genotypes of human papillomaviruses with cancer of the
uterine cervix, of Epstein–Barr virus with Burkitt’s lymphoma (largely
in Africa) and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (in China), of human
herpesvirus 8 with Kaposi sarcoma, and of Helicobacter pylori with
gastric ulcers and gastric cancer50–52. Some data even suggest infec-
tious aetiologies for cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus53,
major causes of death and disability worldwide. Other associations
between infectious agents and idiopathic chronic diseases will
inevitably be found.

Re-emerging and resurging infections
Re-emerging and resurging infections are those that existed in the
past but are now rapidly increasing either in incidence or in geo-
graphical or human host range. Re-emergence is caused by some of
the factors that cause newly emerging infectious diseases, such as
microbial evolutionary vigour, zoonotic encounters and environ-
mental encroachment. Re-emergences or at least cyclical resurgences
of some diseases may also be climate-related — for example, the 
El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon is associated
with resurgences of cholera and malaria54.
Geographical spread of infections
The impact of both new and re-emerging infectious diseases on
human populations is affected by the rate and degree to which they
spread across geographical areas, depending on the movement of
human hosts or of the vectors or reservoirs of infections. Travel has an
important role in bringing people into contact with infectious
agents55. An increase in travel-associated importations of diseases was
anticipated as early as 1933, when commercial air travel was still in its
infancy56. This has since been demonstrated dramatically by an inter-
national airline hub-to-hub pandemic spread of acute haemorrhagic
conjunctivitis in 1981 (ref. 57), by epidemics of meningococcal
meningitis associated with the Hajj, and more recently by the exporta-
tion of epidemic SARS (a newly emerging disease) from Guangdong
Province, China, to Hong Kong, and from there to Beijing, Hanoi,
Singapore, Toronto and elsewhere5 (Fig. 3). The persistent spread of
HIV along air, trucking, drug-trafficking and troop-deployment
routes is a deadly variation on this theme35–37.
Malaria
Plasmodium falciparum malaria was neglected for several decades,
but is now among the most important re-emerging diseases world-
wide (Fig. 2). Years of effective use of dichlorodiphenyltrichloro-
ethane (DDT) led to the abandonment of other mosquito-control
programmes, but the insecticide fell into disuse because of mosquito
resistance and concerns about the insecticide’s potentially harmful
effects on humans and wildlife. Consequently, malaria has re-emerged,
and the situation has been worsened by the development of drug
resistance to chloroquine and mefloquine58. Research efforts focus on
the development of vaccines59 and new drugs, and on re-establishing
public health measures such as the use of bed nets.
Tuberculosis
Tuberculosis is one of the most deadly re-emerging diseases (Fig. 2).
The discovery of isoniazid and other drugs initially led to effective
tuberculosis cures, empty sanitoria and the dismantling of public
health control systems in developed nations. Consequently, by the
1980s, when tuberculosis had re-emerged in the era of HIV/AIDS,
local and state health departments in the United States lacked field,
laboratory and clinical staff and so had to reinvent tuberculosis-
control programmes25. The remarkable re-emergence of tuberculosis
was fuelled by the immune deficiencies of people with AIDS, which
greatly increases the risk of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infec-
tions progressing to active disease, and being transmitted to others.
Inadequate courses of anti-tuberculosis therapy compound the
problem, leading to the emergence and spread of drug-resistant and
multidrug-resistant strains60, and a need for more expensive treat-
ment strategies such as directly observed therapy. It has been known
for over a century that tuberculosis is a disease of poverty, associated
with crowding and inadequate hygiene. The continuing expansion
of global populations living in poverty makes tuberculosis more
difficult to control.
Drug-resistant microbes
Drug resistance, another factor causing microbial and viral re-emer-
gence, may result from mutation (for example, in the case of viruses
and M. tuberculosis), or from bacterial acquisition of extraneous
genes through transformation or infection with plasmids. Sequential
emergences of Staphylococcus aureusthat are resistant to sulpha drugs
(1940s), penicillin (1950s), methicillin (1980s) and to vancomycin in
2002 (ref. 61) — a last line of antibiotic defence for some multiply
drug-resistant bacteria — are troubling. Nosocomial Enterococcus
faecalis became fully resistant to vancomycin by 1988, and then
apparently transferred vanA resistance genes to co-infecting
staphylococci61. Methicillin-resistant staphylococci are now being
isolated from livestock that have been fed with growth-promoting
antibiotics62, possibly contributing to resistance problems in
humans. Many other important microbes have also become effec-
tive ‘resistors’, among them Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria
gonorrhoeae63.
Opportunistic re-emerging infections
Immune deficiency associated with AIDS, and with chemotherapy
for cancer, immune-mediated diseases and transplantation, has con-
tributed to an enormous global increase in the numbers of immuno-
suppressed people over the past few decades (probably more than 1%
of the world’s population), setting the stage for the re-emergence of
many opportunistic infections. HIV, which has infected more than
60 million people globally33, is the largest single cause of human
immune deficiency and markedly increases vulnerability to a wide
range of opportunistic pathogens, including Pneumocystis carinii,
various fungi, tuberculosis, protozoa and herpesviruses64. Break-
throughs in cancer therapy and in immunosuppressive therapies
used to treat immune-mediated diseases and for transplanta-
tion65,66 can also leave patients susceptible to opportunistic infec-
tions. Human organ transplantation adds a further risk of infection
with undetected pathogens in donor tissues, and transplantation of
animal organs introduces the risk of transmission to humans of
animal microbes67.
Re-emerging zoonotic and vector-borne diseases
The emergence of zoonotic and vector-borne diseases can also be
associated with human behaviours and environmental perturbation.
In 2003, monkeypox — an endemic infection of African rodents —
crossed the Atlantic with exported pets, which were then shipped
from Texas to infect people throughout the US Midwest4. Lyme dis-
ease, caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, re-emerged in the United States
as a result of suburban expansion, which brought people into
increasing contact with deer, deer mice and ticks. Similarly, tick-
borne encephalitis re-emerged in Russia when weekend getaways

Selected factors contribute to the emergence/re-emergence of
infectious diseases25,26. These factors, which frequently differ for
‘newly emerging’, ‘re-emerging/resurging’ and ‘deliberately
emerging’ diseases, include genetic, biological, and social, political
and economic factors.
• Microbial adaptation and change
• Human susceptibility to infection
• Climate and weather
• Changing ecosystems
• Human demographics and behaviour
• Economic development and land use
• International travel and commerce
• Technology and industry
• Breakdown of public health measures
• Poverty and social inequality
• War and famine
• Lack of political will

(dachas) drew city dwellers into contact with forest ticks. The simul-
taneous 1999 emergences of encephalitis due to West Nile virus in the
United States and in Russia68,69 reflect abundances of eclectic vector
mosquitoes and avian hosts in these locations. Both were probably
connected to endemic sites by virus carriage in migratory birds and
travellers. The remarkable geographical spread of West Nile virus in
the five years since its introduction into the Western Hemisphere
reflects an unfortunate confluence of viral promiscuity and ecologi-
cal diversity70. Although humans are dead-end hosts for West Nile
virus, the risk of infection is greatly increased by marked zoonotic
viral amplification and persistence in the environment. Unlike most
viruses, which tend to be fairly narrowly adapted to specific hosts,
West Nile virus is known to infect more than 30 North American
mosquito species, which together transmit infection to at least 150
North American bird species, many of which migrate to new and dis-
tant locations, spreading the virus to rural and urban ecosystems
throughout North and Central America70.
Although West Nile virus is now a major epidemiological concern
in the developed world, dengue remains the most significant and
widespread flavivirus disease to have emerged globally71. A 2001–2002
epidemic in Hawaii — fortunately without fatalities — is a reminder
that dengue has also re-emerged in locations once considered to be
dengue-free. Usually transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes,
dengue has recently been transmitted by Aedes albopictus — a vector
switch of potential significance with respect to dengue re-emergence71.
In the Americas, including many US southern states, A. albopictus has
been spreading into areas where A. aegyptimosquitoes are not found,
and persisting for longer seasonal periods, putting tens of millions
more people at risk of dengue infection. Dengue re-emergence is fur-
ther complicated by disturbing increases in a serious and formerly
rare form of the disease, dengue haemorrhagic fever (dengue shock
syndrome being its highly fatal form). These severe complications are
thought to result from the evolution of dengue viruses to escape high

population immunity, seen in increased viral virulence and human
immunopathogenesis due to antibody-dependent enhancement of
viral infection72.
Cholera is also of interest, not only as an important cause of mor-
tality, but also because of the complexity of factors that determine its
re-emergence. Both virulent and avirulent strains of these zoonotic
bacteria are maintained in the environment and are rapidly evolving
in association with phyto- and zooplankton, algae and crustaceans.
Such environmental strains seem to act as reservoirs for human
virulence genes (for example, genes for the phage-encoded cholera
toxin and the toxin-coregulated pilus (TCP) factor associated with
attachment), and to undergo gene transfer events that lead to new
strains containing further virulence gene combinations. These result
in periodic cholera emergences that cause epidemics and pan-
demics73. Thus, although the disease we know as cholera has
appeared to be clinically and epidemiologically stable at least since
the third pandemic (in the 1840s), modern evidence suggests that
such apparent stability masks aggressive bacterial evolution in
complex natural environments.
Influenza A
Influenza A viruses, which are endemic gastrointestinal viruses of
wild waterfowl, have evolved elaborate mechanisms to jump species
into domestic fowl, farm animals and humans. Periodic gene seg-
ment reassortments between human and animal viruses produce
important antigenic changes, referred to as ‘shifts’. These can lead to
deadly pandemics, as occurred in 1888, 1918, 1957 and 1968 (refs 74,
75). In intervening years, shifted viruses undergo continual but less
dramatic antigenic changes called ‘drifts’, which allow them partially
to escape human immunity raised by previously circulating
influenza viruses. Influenza drift is an evolutionary success story for
the virus. Influenza A has a seemingly inexhaustible repertoire of
mutational possibilities at several critical epitopes surrounding the

viral haemagglutinin site that attaches to human cells. It remains
something of a mystery how zoonotic influenza viruses mix with each
other and with human strains to acquire the additional properties of
human virulence and human-to-human transmissibility.
Before 1997, mild cases of human disease associated with avian
influenza viruses were occasionally reported76. These events have
become more frequent, sometimes resulting in severe cases of disease
and death. Avian influenza has recently made dead-end jumps to
humans — for example, the 1997 Hong Kong outbreak of the
newly emergent H5N1 influenza, the 2003 H7N7 epidemic in the
Netherlands, the 2003–2004 H5N1 and H7N3 epizootics in Asia
and elsewhere, and occasional cases of H9N2 disease (Fig. 4).
Meanwhile, back-switches of human H3N2 viruses have emerged
in pigs, from which both doubly mixed (pig–human) and triply
mixed (pig–human–avian) viruses74,75 have been isolated. Such
enzootic/zoonotic mixing is suspected to have occurred in the
influenza pandemic of 1918–1920, which was caused by an H1N1
virus with an avian-like receptor-binding site77. The predicted viru-
lence genes of this virus are now being sought from 85-year-old
pathology specimens and from frozen corpses78. The implications of
interspecies genetic mixing for future influenza pandemics are
troubling. Although much remains speculative about how influenza
viruses emerge and spread, it seems clear that the process is driven by
prolific and complex viral evolution (genetic reassortment and
mutational ‘drift’), interspecies mixing and adaptation, and ecologi-
cal factors that bring humans into contact with animals and each
other. By whatever means new influenza virus pandemic strains
emerge, they eventually reach a critical threshold of human trans-
mission beyond which epidemic and pandemic spread follows
mathematically predictable patterns.
The dynamics and determinants of such epidemic development
have been studied since the nineteenth century for several infectious
diseases. For influenza, both historical and prospective epidemics
have been described or predicted using deterministic and stochastic
mathematical models, often with surprising accuracy when com-
pared with actual epidemic data. More complicated mathematical
models that describe how diseases spread by means other than person-
to-person aerosol transmission have generally been less successful in
describing and predicting epidemics, but have nonetheless been
helpful in planning public health responses to epidemics caused by
HIV79, vCJD80and other diseases.
Mathematical modelling is also used to determine the impact of
emerging epidemics. For example, it has been difficult to estimate
overall influenza mortality because fatal infections are often neither
diagnosed nor accurately recorded in hospital records and death cer-
tificates, especially in the elderly. Recent epidemiological attempts to
obtain improved influenza mortality estimates from seasonal excess
mortality data81 have indicated that influenza mortality may be

greater than was previously suspected, because influenza deaths are
frequently coded under seemingly unrelated categories such as
cardiovascular diseases. The same approaches also show that other
influenza-like deaths may actually be due to other agents, such as
respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a common childhood virus that in
the past decade has emerged as a major cause of adult mortality81.
Deliberately emerging infections
Deliberately emerging microbes are those that have been developed
by man, usually for nefarious use. The term ‘deliberately emerging’
refers to both naturally occurring microbial agents such as anthrax6,
and to bioengineered microorganisms such as those created by the
insertion of genetic virulence factors that produce or exacerbate
disease. Deliberately emerging microbes include microorganisms
or toxins produced in a form that would cause maximal harm
because of ease of dissemination, enhanced infectivity or heightened
pathogenicity82.
Bioterrorism and biowarfare
As concepts, bioterrorism and biowarfare are probably not new. The
alleged catapulting of plague-ridden corpses over enemy walls in the
1346 siege of Caffa (the modern Crimean port of Feodosia, Ukraine)
and the dispatch of smallpox-impregnated blankets to Indians by
British officers in the Seven Years War (1754–1763) have frequently
been cited as examples of bioterrorism or biowarfare83,84.
Two modern attacks have been well documented. In 1984, an
Oregon religious cult spiked restaurant salad bars with Salmonellae
in an attempt to sway a local election85. A 2001 anthrax attack6, in
which a terrorist mailed anthrax-spore-filled letters to prominent fig-
ures, including two US senators, resulted in illness in at least 18 people
and the death of five of these individuals. Public alarm was elevated by
the knowledge that Bacillus anthracis is a common and easily obtain-
able enzootic and soil organism found in laboratories worldwide, and
that scientific technology had increased its lethality: the spores had
been weaponized by being concentrated, finely milled and packed
with a dispersal agent to increase their capacity to disseminate82. The
United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and other
nations once had sophisticated offensive bioweapons programmes
that included the production of weaponized anthrax spores82. Soviet
scientists continued to produce large quantities of organisms adapted
for biowarfare and bioterror — among them the agents of smallpox,
plague, tularaemia and Marburg virus — for several years after their
signing of the Bioweapons and Toxins Treaty Convention in 1972,
which forbade such activities82. By 1987, the Soviet programme was
annually producing 5,000 tonnes of weaponized anthrax spores,
packing them into warheads and other delivery devices82.
Before the 2001 anthrax attacks6, the US scientific community
had for several years been bolstering its biodefence research capacity.
The anthrax attacks greatly accelerated this expansion as part of a
national defence plan, which includes efforts to provide a knowledge
base for the development of effective countermeasures against agents
of bioterror, such as diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines, and to
translate this knowledge into the production and delivery of such
measures86. Bioterror agents have been grouped into three categories
of risk87. The six category A agents (anthrax, smallpox, plague,
tularaemia, viral haemorrhagic fevers and clostridial botulinum
toxin) are given top priority because they are highly lethal and readily
deployed as weapons. Category B and C agents include food-borne
and water-borne organisms that incapacitate but usually do not kill.
Meeting the challenge of emerging infections
Infectious diseases will continue to emerge and re-emerge, leading to
unpredictable epidemics and difficult challenges to public health and
to microbiology and allied sciences.
Surveillance and response, the key elements in controlling EIs, be
they naturally occurring or deliberately engineered, depend on rapid
clinical diagnosis and detection and containment in populations and

in the environment. Globally, such efforts are coordinated by the
World Health Organization, which recently led a multifaceted effort to
successfully contain the global SARS outbreak of 2002–2003 (ref. 88).
In the United States, such efforts are led by the US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC)89, which along with state and local
health departments and other agencies have been making significant
strides in national surveillance–response capacity. The enormous
influx of US government-funded research resources (largely through
the National Institutes of Health) and public health resources (mainly
through the CDC, and state and local public health agencies) in
response to the increased threat of a bioterrorist attack86 will fortify
the response capabilities related to all EIs.
However, it is clear that surveillance and other activities that tradi-
tionally fall within the domain of public health are not in themselves
sufficient to adequately address the problem of EIs. Of critical impor-
tance are basic, translational and applied research efforts to develop
advanced countermeasures such as surveillance tools, diagnostic
tests, vaccines and therapeutics86. Genomics, proteomics and advances
in nanotechnology90 are increasingly being exploited in diagnostic,
therapeutic and microbial research applications, and in rational drug
and vaccine design. Direct and computational structural determina-
tion91, prediction of protein–protein interactions between micro-
organisms and drugs, and sophisticated bioinformatics techniques
support research in all of the above areas. These technologies have led
to numerous advances in real-world utility against EIs, most notably
in the development of more than 20 antiretroviral drugs that can
effectively suppress HIV replication. Where they are available and
properly used in HIV-infected individuals, these medications have
dramatically reduced HIV morbidity and mortality92.
Gene- and protein-based microarrays can be used to detect
pathogen signals, to monitor resistance to anti-infective agents, to
characterize host gene responses to recent infections, and to facilitate
the development of new drugs and vaccines93. Basic and applied
research together have provided promising new vaccine platforms,
such as recombinant proteins, immunogenic peptides, naked DNA
vaccines, viral vectors of extraneous genes encoding immunogenic
proteins (including chimaeras), replicons and pseudovirions94. Many
novel vaccine candidates are now being developed against EIs such as
HIV, Ebola virus, West Nile virus, dengue, the SARS coronavirus,
tuberculosis and malaria. Of particular note are novel tuberculosis
vaccines that recently entered clinical trials — the first time in more
than 60 years that new approaches to vaccination for tuberculosis
have been assessed in humans95. Chimaeric flavivirus vaccines for
West Nile virus, dengue and Japanese encephalitis virus are effective
in animal models and are in various stages of clinical testing95.
Our growing understanding of the human immune system is also
helping to accelerate vaccine development. This is especially true in
the case of innate immune responses, which are evolutionarily older,
less specific and faster-acting than the adaptive responses that have
been the traditional targets of vaccines96. As we learn more about
innate immunity and its relationship with the adaptive immune
system, opportunities to create more effective vaccine adjuvants
will emerge. For example, synthetic DNA sequences that contain
repeated CpG motifs mimic the stimulatory activity that bacterial
DNA fragments exert on the innate immune system. These sequences
show promise as vaccine adjuvants that accelerate and augment
immune responses97. We can anticipate more progress of this kind as
we continue to delineate the complex interactions between innate
and adaptive immune responses.
The sequencing of the human genome, the genomes of six other
animals, including the mouse, and those of microbial vectors and
microbes themselves (for example, P. falciparum and its mosquito
vector, Anopheles gambiae), have elevated microbiology to a whole-
genome level. The ability to sequence microbial genomes in a few
days98 or less, and to examine host–vector–microbe interactions at
both the genome level and at the tertiary protein structural level, will
help us to understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie the
pathogenesis of infectious disease and host defences, including
resistance and immune evasion. These advances will facilitate the
development of new countermeasures. Other fertile areas of research
include the use of geographical information systems99 and satellite
imaging to support field study and epidemic prevention (for exam-
ple, predicting HPS and Rift Valley fever epidemics in indigenous
areas by satellite imagery of water and vegetation related to animal
reservoir and vector prevalence).
Underlying disease emergence are evolutionary conflicts between
rapidly evolving and adapting infectious agents and their slowly
evolving hosts. These are fought out in the context of accelerating
environmental and human behavioural alterations that provide new
ecological niches into which evolving microbes can readily fit. It is
essential that broadly based prevention strategies, as well as new and
improved countermeasures (that is, surveillance tools, diagnostics,
therapeutics and vaccines), be continually tested, refined and
upgraded, requiring a strengthened relationship between public
health and basic and clinical sciences. The challenge presented by the
ongoing conflict between pathogenic microorganisms and man has
been well summarized by a noted champion of the war on EIs, Joshua
Lederberg: “The future of microbes and mankind will probably
unfold as episodes of a suspense thriller that could be entitled Our Wits
Versus Their Genes”29. The global scientific and public health commu-
nities must confront this reality not only with wit, but also with vision
and sustained commitment to meet a perpetual challenge.
