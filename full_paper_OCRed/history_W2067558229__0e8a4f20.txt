Abstract
Sea anemones are seemingly primitive animals that, along with corals, jellyfish, and hydras,
constitute the Cnidaria, the oldest eumetazoan phylum.  Here we report a comparative analysis of
the draft genome of an emerging cnidarian model, the starlet anemone Nematostella vectensis. 
The anemone genome is surprisingly complex, with a gene repertoire, exon-intron structure, and
large-scale gene linkage more similar to vertebrates than to flies or nematodes.  These results
imply that the genome of the eumetazoan ancestor was similarly complex, and that fly and
nematode genomes have been modified via sequence divergence, gene and intron loss, and
genomic rearrangement.  Nearly one-fifth of the genes of the ancestor are eumetazoan novelties
in the sense that they have no recognizable homologs outside of animals, or contain new protein
domains and/or domain combinations that are not found in other eukaryotes.   These eumetazoan-
specific genes are enriched for animal functions like cell signaling, adhesion, and synaptic
transmission, and analysis of diverse pathways suggests that these gene "inventions" along the
lineage leading to animals were already likely well integrated with pre-existing eukaryotic genes
in the eumetazoan progenitor.  Subsequent diversification in the cnidarian and bilaterian lineages
was therefore associated with new regulatory linkages and higher-level integration of these pre-
existing pathways and networks.

Introduction
All living "tissue-grade" animals, or "eumetazoans," are descended from the last common
ancestor of bilaterians (flies, worms, snails, humans), cnidarians (anemones, jellyfish, hydra), and
ctenophores (comb jellies)(1, 2).  This eumetazoan ancestor lived perhaps seven hundred million
years ago, but is not preserved in the fossil record(3).    Yet we can infer many of its
characteristics -- flagellated sperm, development through a process of gastrulation, multiple germ
layers, true epithelia lying upon a basement membrane, a lined gut (enteron), a neuromuscular
system, multiple sensory systems, and fixed body axes -- since they are conserved features
retained by its modern descendants.
Similarly, we can characterize the genome of this long-dead eumetazoan progenitor by
comparing modern DNA and protein sequences and identifying conserved features in different
modern lineages.  Our ability to recognize ancient genomic features depends on the availability of
sequences from diverse living animals, and can only illuminate genomic characteristics that have
an intrinsically slow rate of change and/or are preserved by selective pressures.  Comparisons (4-
6) between fruit fly, nematode, and vertebrate genomes reveal greater genomic complexity in the
vertebrates (and other deuterostomes (7, 8)) as measured by gene content and structure, but at the
same time show that many genes and networks are shared across bilaterians.  To probe the
ancestral eumetazoan genome requires sequences from even deeper branches of the animal tree,
comparing bilaterian and non-bilaterian phyla.

----- Page 3 (native) -----
In comparison with bilaterians, cnidarians appear morphologically simple. The phylum is defined
(see., e.g., (2)) by a sac-like body plan with a single "oral" opening, two-epithelial tissue layers,
the presence of numerous tentacles, a nerve net, and  the characteristic stinging cells (cnidocytes,
literally, "nettle cells") that give the phylum its name (Figure 1g).  The class Anthozoa ("flower
animals") includes diverse anemones, corals, and sea pens, all of which lack a medusa stage.  The
other Cnidarian classes are united by their pelagic medusae and uniquely linear mitochondrial
genomes (9) into the Medusozoa, including  Hydra and related hydroids, jellyfish, and box
jellies.  Some of the oldest animal body fossils (e.g., the Ediacaran Charnodiscus (10) but see
also (11, 12)) and fossil embryos (13) are plausibly relics of stem cnidarians, suggesting a
Precambrian origin for the phylum.
Among Anthozoan cnidarians, the starlet sea anemone Nematostella vectensis is an emerging
model system (14, 15). This estuarine burrowing anemone is found on the Atlantic and Pacific
coasts of North America, as well as the coast of southeast England (16) (Figure 1).
Nematostella cultures are easily maintained in the laboratory. With separate sexes, inducible
spawning, and external fertilization (14, 17), embryos are available throughout the year. 
Fertilization is followed by cell divisions resulting in a hollow blastula, which gastrulates by
invagination and ingression to produce a ciliated, tear-drop-shaped planula larva that swims with
an apical tuft of sensory cilia at the front and the blastopore at the rear (Figure 1a-e, h, i). On the
seventh day after fertilization, the planula develops into a juvenile polyp, with the blastopore
becoming the mouth (14, 18, 19) (Figure 1f).  Like many cnidarians, adult Nematostella are

----- Page 4 (native) -----
apparently immortal, with prodigious powers of regeneration: animals cut in half heal into two
complete individuals, mimicking the natural process of asexual reproduction that occurs by
transverse pinching.   Recent studies with Nematostella have addressed the evolutionary origins
of  mesoderm, germ cell specification, and axial patterning in metazoans (Figure 1j, k) (15, 20-
25)
 
While cnidarians are often characterized as "simple" or "primitive," closer study of Nematostella
and its relatives is revealing considerable molecular and morphological complexity (15). 
Signaling pathways and transcription factors involved in the early patterning and development of
bilaterians are present in cnidarians and active in development, indicating that these pathways
and regulatory mechanisms predate the eumetazoan radiation.  Perhaps most strikingly, genes
that establish the main body axes in bilaterian embryos are also expressed asymmetrically in
Nematostella development, even though cnidarians are conventionally viewed as "radial" animals
[for a critical discussion, see (26)].  The expression domains occur with apparent bilaterial
symmetry, i.e., reflecting distinct directed axes both along and perpendicular to the main body
axis, and with a left-right plane of symmetry (27-29). Although anemones show only subtle
external morphological manifestations of bilateral symmetry (Figure 1k) (i.e., asymmetry in the
structure of the adult pharynx and associated mesenteries (30)), these results suggest the antiquity
of "bilaterian" patterning mechanisms.
Here we report the draft genome of the starlet sea anemone, and use its gene repertoire and
genome organization to reconstruct features of the ancestral eumetazoan genome.  Analysis of the
Nematostella genome in the context of sequences from other eukaryotes reveals the genomic

----- Page 5 (native) -----
complexity of this last common cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor, and begins to illuminate the rich
history of genes and gene networks already present at the base of the animal tree of life.  The
emerging picture is one of surprising conservation in gene content, structure, and organization
between Nematostella and vertebrates, even to the point of retaining chromosome-scale gene
blocks whose linkage in modern genomes has been preserved from the genome of their common
ancestor.  These are the most ancient conserved linkages known outside of prokaryotic operons. 
In contrast, the fruit fly and nematode model systems have experienced significant gene loss,
intron loss, and genome rearrangement.   Thus from a genomic perspective, the eumetazoan
ancestor more closely resembled modern vertebrates and anemones.
Genome Sequencing and Assembly
The draft sequence of the Nematostella was produced using a random shotgun strategy (31) from
approximately 6.5X paired-end sequence coverage from several shotgun libraries of a range of
insert sizes (32).  The total assembly spans ~357 Mb, with half of this sequence in 181 scaffolds
longer than ~470 Kb.  Metaphase spreads indicate a diploid chromosome number of 2N=30 (Fig
S2.4).  Currently there are no physical or genetic maps of Nematostella, so we could not
reconstruct the genome as chromosomes.  Nevertheless, since half of the predicted genes are in
scaffolds containing 48 or more genes, the present draft assembly is sufficiently long-range to
permit useful analysis of synteny with other species, as shown below. The typical locus in the
draft genome is in a contiguous gap-free stretch of nearly 20 Kb.  Comparison of the assembled
sequence with open reading frames derived from expressed sequence tags (ESTs, see below)
shows that the assembly captures ~95% of the known protein coding content (32).  While
approximately one-third of the shotgun sequences were not assembled, they could typically be

----- Page 6 (native) -----
characterized as derived from long (>100 Kb) tandem-repetitive minisatellite arrays suggestive of
heterochromatin, implying a total genome size of ~450 Mb (32).
To avoid contamination from commensal microbes common to adult anemones and minimize the
impact of haplotypic variation, we prepared genomic DNA from the larvae of a single mating
pair originally isolated from the same lagoon (32). Our dataset thus nominally contains up to four
haplotypes at each locus.  From the shotgun assembly and the analysis of alignments between
shotgun reads, we measured a rate of single nucleotide polymorphism among the four haplotypes
as 0.8%, or ~1/125 bp, approximately ten times the SNP rate in the human population. (Some
16,000 SNPs may be searches at the SNP browser available at StellaBase (http://stellabase.org;
(33)). After correcting for sampling, we estimated that each pair of haplotypes differ at 0.65% of
nucleotide positions (32).  Thus the parental anemones whose genomes we sampled have
somewhat less allelic variation than broadcast spawning invertebrates such as sea squirts
(~2%)(7) and sea urchins (5-10%) (8), or outbreeding plants like Populus (~2%) (34), but a
comparable amount to the pufferfish (0.5%) (35). 
Nematostella, however, is not a true broadcast spawner, since while males release sperm into the
water, females lay tens to hundreds of eggs encased in a jelly mass that becomes fixed to a
benthic substrate.  The egg mass may be a derived feature of Nematostella that is related to its
colonization of the estuarine environment.  The relatively low level of intra-specific genetic
variation in Nematostella vs. marine broadcast spawners might be explained if its estuarine
habitat limited gamete dispersal and led to a smaller efective population size.  Genetic

----- Page 7 (native) -----
fingerprinting of wild Nematostella populations indicates a high degree of genetic structuring at
fine spatial scales, implying extremely low levels of gene flow between neighboring estuaries
(36).  The source population for the genome sequence (Rhode River, Maryland) appears typical
in this regard (37). 
Nematostella gene set
We estimate that the Nematostella genome contains ~18,000 bona fide protein-coding genes,
comparable to gene counts in other animals.  Combining homology-based and ab initio methods
with sequences from over 146,000 expressed sequence tags, we predicted ~27,000 complete or
partial protein-coding transcripts in the genome (32).   More than 12,000 of these are found in
robust eumetazoan gene families, and are therefore supported as orthologs of genes in other
animals (see below).  While ~22,000 of all predicted genes have a significant alignment (BLAST
e-value < 1e-10) to known proteins in SwissProt/Trembl and therefore have some homology
support, analysis of a random sampling of genes suggest that some of these appear to be gene
fragments, possible pseudogenes, or relics of transposable elements, leading to a discounting of
the true gene count to ~18,000 (32).  Slightly more than 10% of the EST contigs have significant
(95% identify, 75% length) alignments to multiple scaffolds (32), providing an estimate of the
redundancy of the assembly, which appears to arise from the occasional separate assembly of
divergent haplotypes.  More than 25% of the genome is made of repetitive elements that are
fossilized copies of transposable elements. Over 500 families of them were discovered in the
genome, including DNA transposons and both LTR and non-LTR retrotransposons (Table S2.3).
The ancestral eumetazoan gene set

----- Page 8 (native) -----
By comparing the gene complement of Nematostella with other metazoans, we attempted to
reconstruct the gene repertoire of the eumetazoan (i.e., cnidarian-bilaterian) ancestor and to infer
the gains, losses, and duplications that occurred both before and after the eumetazoan radiation. 
A simple way to identify putative orthologs (genes descended from the same gene in the common
ancestor) between genomes is through reciprocal best-scoring BLAST hits (38).  Surprisingly, the
human genome has many more such orthologous pairs with Nematostella (6,989) than with non-
vertebrate bilaterians, including Drosophila (5,772), C. elegans (4,846), and even the invertebrate
chordate Ciona intestinalis (6,313).  These results strongly suggest that many genes and gene
families previously assumed to be chordate or vertebrate innovations are actually much more
ancient, and conversely that the fruit fly, soil nematode, and sea squirt lineages have experienced
higher levels of divergence and gene loss than Nematostella, consistent with phylogenetic the
analysis described below.
To approximate the gene repertoire of the eumetazoan ancestor we constructed 7,766 putatively
orthologous gene families that are anchored by reciprocal best-scoring BLAST alignments
between genes from anemone and one or more of fly, nematode, human, frog, or fish [S].   Each
family thus represents a single gene in the eumetazoan ancestor whose descendents survive in
recognizable form as modern genes in both cnidarians and bilaterians.  These families account for
a significant fraction of genes in modern animals: we estimate that nearly two thirds of human
genes (13,830) are descended from these progenitors through subsequent gene family expansions
along the human lineage, and a comparable number (12,319) of predicted Nematostella genes
arose by independent diversifications along the cnidarian branch, with 7,309 (~50%) and 7,261
(~40%) found in Drosophila and C. elegans, respectively. Our reconstructed ancestral gene set is

----- Page 9 (native) -----
necessarily incomplete since we cannot capture genes that were present in the eumetazoan
progenitor but became highly diverged or lost in one or more descendents, nevertheless it
provides a starting point for further analysis.
Of the 7,766 ancestral eumetazoan gene families, only 72% (5,626) are represented in the
complete genomes of all three major modern eumetazoan lineages: cnidarians (i.e.,
Nematostella), protostomes (i.e., Drosophila and/or C. elegans), and deuterostomes (requiring
presence of at least two of pufferfish, frog, and human).  1,292 eumetazoan gene families have
detectable descendents in anemone and at least two of the three vertebrates, but appear to be
absent in both fruit fly and soil nematode, and were therefore either lost (or were highly diverged)
in both of these model protostomes. Before the Nematostella genome sequence, it was more
parsimonious to assume that most of these genes were vertebrate or deuterostome innovations
(with the exception of individual genes whose phylogenetic distribution has been more widely
studied).  The forthcoming genome sequences of crustaceans, annelids, and molluscs will help
address which of these genes may have survived in the protostome lineage but were lost in flies
and nematodes.   In contrast, only 33 genes are found in Nematostella and both Drosophila and
C. elegans but not in any vertebrate, representing putative deuterostome or vertebrate loss,
indicating a much lower degree of gene loss in the vertebrates than in the ecdysozoan model
systems.  We found 673 gene families represented in model protostomes and vertebrates, but not
in Nematostella.  These are candidates for bilaterian novelties. 
Molecular evolution of the Eumetazoa
To address evolutionary relationships between animals, we inferred the phylogeny of Metazoa by

----- Page 10 (native) -----
combining Nematostella data with available genomic sequences from diverse animals, using a
subset of 337 single copy genes suitable for deep phylogenetic analysis (32). In Figure 2, relative
branch lengths represent the accumulation of amino acid substitutions in each lineage across this
set of proteins. As expected, the two cnidarians Nematostella and Hydra form a monophyletic
group that branched off the metazoan stem prior to the radiation of bilaterians.  The depth of the
Nematostella-Hydra split (comparable to the protostome-deuterostome divergence) emphasizes
the distant relationship between anthozoans and hydrozoans.  This supports the paleontological
evidence that the radiation of the cnidarian phylum is quite ancient, and suggests that significant
variation in gene content and gene family diversity may be found when the anemone genome is
compared with that of the hydrozoan Hydra.
Our whole genome analysis groups the fruit fly with the soil nematode, in support of the
superphylum Ecdysozoa, a major element of the "new animal phylogeny" (39).  This contrasts
with other whole-genome-based studies that support an early branching acoelomate clade that
includes C. elegans (40, 41).  The apparent basal position of the nematode lineage in these
studies is widely believed to be a long branch artifact.   In other studies (e.g., (42)), the effect of
long branch attraction is minimized by including additional taxa that break up long branches,
generating a phylogeny that agrees with our more limited taxon sampling but larger gene set.  We
also generated ~15,000 ESTs from the ctenophore (comb jelly) Mnemiopsis leidyii to attempt to
place this enigmatic phylum on the tree, but  could not resolve its precise phylogenetic position
with significant support (32).  For convenience, here we refer to the last common ancestor of
cnidarians and bilaterians as the "eumetazoan ancestor," although the precise phylogenetic
placement of ctenophores may revise this designation.

----- Page 11 (native) -----
Long branch lengths, indicating increased levels of sequence divergence, were found along the
fly, nematode, and sea squirt lineages.  The sea anemone sequences, however, appear to be
evolving at a rate comparable to, or even somewhat lower than, vertebrates.   The relatively slow
rate of protein sequence evolution in Nematostella compared to fly and nematode can be seen
more directly by considering the amino-acid percent identity between reciprocal-best-hits of
selected proteomes vs. human.  Despite the fact that flies and nematodes share a more recent
common ancestor with human than sea anemones do, we find that the anemone peptides are more
similar to human than to either of the model protostomes (32).  This surprising similarity between
Nematostella and vertebrates is a recurring theme of our analysis, indicating that both the
anemone and vertebrate genomes retain more ancestral eumetazoan features than sequences from
flies and nematodes.
While accelerated rates of molecular evolution have been documented in flies and echinoderms
(43) relative to vertebrates, our analysis does not support the extrapolation of these higher rates to
all invertebrates.  Using our branch lengths, a very crude molecular clock interpolation based on
the eukaryotic time scales of Douzery et al. (42) suggests that the eumetazoan ancestor lived
~670-820 Mya (32).  This is of course only a very rough estimate with numerous caveats, most
notably that there is no guarantee that the rate of protein evolution was constant on the
eumetazoan stem, but provides a rough time scale for the eumetazoan radiation.
Conservation of ancient eumetazoan introns

----- Page 12 (native) -----
Comparison of Nematostella genes to those of other animals reveals that the ancestral
eumetazoan genome must have been intron-rich, with gene structures closely resembling those of
modern vertebrate and anemone genes.   Intron-containing genes that are descended from the
ancestral eumetazoan gene set in humans and anemones have a median of ~8 and ~6 introns per
gene respectively, while those from fruit fly have only ~3. (32).  Not only are the number of
exons per gene similar between Nematostella and vertebrates, but the precise location and phase
(i.e., the positioning of the splice sites relative to codon boundaries) of introns are also highly
conserved between anemone and human.  Intron conservation can be unambiguously assessed by
identifying well-aligned regions of orthologous proteins that are interrupted by introns in one or
more species (Figure 3a).  Note that this analysis is protected from the effects of gene modeling
artifacts, since erroneous predictions in the vicinity of splice sites would disrupt alignment,
thereby removing such sequences from consideration.
Introns that are shared between Nematostella and vertebrates and/or other bilaterians are most
parsimoniously interpreted as conserved ancient eumetazoan introns (44).  Within alignable
regions, nearly 81% of human introns are found in the same position and phase in Nematostella,
and conversely 82% of the anemone introns are also found in orthologous positions in human
genes.   The results from Nematostella subsume the report of introns conserved between
vertebrates and the polychaete Platynereis dumerlii (45), since these can now be recognized as
ancient eumetazoan introns, rather than "vertebrate-like" gene structures.
Using whole genome data sets we can measure the tempo of intron evolution across metazoan

----- Page 13 (native) -----
genomes (32).  Figure 3b shows intron gain (left) and loss (right) events inferred by weighted
parsimony analysis of 2,645 intron positions that lie within highly conserved protein sequence in
two or more animals, the flowering plant Arabidopsis, and the relatively intron-rich fungus
Cryptococcus neoformans (32).  Note that although fungi and animals are phylogenetically closer
to each other than either group is to plants, fungi are not by themselves a sufficient outgroup for
characterizing the history of eumetazoan introns, since there are putative ancient eukaryotic
introns shared by modern animals and plants that have evidently been lost in fungi (46).
Althought many eumetazoan introns are evidently of ancient eukaryotic origin (46) -- for
example, nearly 26% of human and Nematostella introns are conserved with Arabidopsis, and
24% with Cryptococcus -- the remainder appear to be shared only by animals.  These animal
introns are most parsimoniously accounted for as gains on the eumetazoan stem, as shown by the
long "gain" branch in Figure 3b.  We cannot rule out the possibility, however, that such
apparently animal-specific introns were in fact present in the last common ancestor of plants,
fungi, and animals, but were convergently lost in both plants and fungi.  Within animals, intron
gains range from 8-22% relative to the content of the eumetazoan ancestor.  Thus assuming ~8
introns per ancestral gene, ~1 novel intron has been introduced in a typical modern animal gene
since the eumetazoan radiation, a rate of approximately ~10-9 introns/gene/year, which is
comparable to the rate of nucleotide substitution and gene duplication (47).
In contrast to intron gains, which seem to occur more or less uniformly across animal phyla,

----- Page 14 (native) -----
some lineages appear to have experienced significant intron loss, notably fly, nematode, and sea
squirt, which have each discarded 50-90% of inferred ancestral eumetazoan introns. We see again
that these model systems are "derived" in the sense of having lost ancestral eumetazoan features
(in this case, introns).  It remains to be seen if the introns absent in both fly and nematode are the
result of ancient loss in the ecdysozoan stem lineage (the most parsimonious explanation, shown
in Fig 3b), or are convergent (independent) losses in flies and nematodes.  We can rule out
ancient loss in the protostome lineage based on the results of Raible et al. (2005) for Platynereis,
which in combination with our analysis shows that the ancestral protostome genome was also
intron-rich.
Conservation of ancient eumetazoan linkage groups
Conserved linkage groups representing ancestral vertebrate chromosomes can be defined by
comparing fish and mammalian genomes and genetic maps, despite the presence of only modest
segments of conserved gene order (48, 49).  Similarly, limited conservation of synteny is
recognizable within insects (e.g., between flies and bees (50)).  Between animal phyla, however,
no significant large-scale conserved synteny has been identified, suggesting that signals of the
ancestral eumetazoan genome organization were erased by subsequent chromosomal breaks and
translocations along the various lineages.  Surprisingly, despite extensive local scrambling of
gene order, we find extensive conservation of synteny between the Nematostella and vertebrate
genomes, allowing the identification of ancient eumetazoan linkage groups.
We first searched for regions of approximately conserved gene order between Nematostella and
human, allowing for local rearrangements as well as independent differential gene loss and/or

----- Page 15 (native) -----
duplication in each genome (51).  We found 33 conserved syntenic segments, each containing 9
or more orthologous gene pairs, under conditions for which no such segments are expected when
gene order is completely randomized in the two genomes (Figure S7.1).  Within each segment,
however, local gene order is considerably scrambled.   Further relaxing gene order constraints
dramatically increases the number of such segments expected by chance, reducing the power of
this approach to detect even more ancient conserved genome organization in the face of intra-
chromosomal rearrangements.  To overcome this limitation we developed a new method to
search for statistically significant conserved linkage groups that does not rely on gene order.
Reasoning that the prevalence of intra-chromosomal inversions and rearrangements (52) might
scramble local gene order yet preserve linkage, we searched for large-scale conserved synteny,
that is, sets of orthologous genes on the same chromosomal segment in their respective genomes,
regardless of gene order.  To remove confounding signals from recent rearrangements, we used
comparisons with the genomes of other chordates to identify 98 human segments large enough
that they each contain descendants of 40 or more ancestral eumetazoan genes, that do not appear
to have undergone recent breaks or fusions (Figures 4a, S7.1) (32).  These segments span 89% of
the base pairs of the human genome.   The human genome was selected as a reference since it is
known to have a slow rate of chromosome evolution relative to other mammals (52), and has
preserved chromosomal segments relative to teleost fish (48).   To search for ancient conserved
linkages across eumetazoa, we then compared these human genome segments to the assembled
Nematostella scaffolds, using a statistical test for distinguishing significant enrichment for genes
linked in both species.

----- Page 16 (native) -----
For every scaffold-segment pair, we tabulated the number of predicted ancestral eumetazoan
genes with descendents found in both the Nematostella scaffold and human segment.  This
number of shared orthologous genes was compared to a null model in which the scaffolds and
segments have gene content independently drawn from the ancestral set.   The "Oxford grid"
shown in Figure 4b illustrates not only that there are many scaffold-segment pairs with a highly
significant excess of shared ancestral genes, but that the anemone scaffolds and human
chromosome segments can be grouped into classes, such that scaffold-segment pairs drawn from
the same class are likely to have a significant excess of shared ancestral genes (32).  Each class of
scaffolds and chromosome segments is most easily interpreted as collecting together segments of
the present day Nematostella and human genomes that descend from the same chromosome of
the eumetazoan ancestor, and therefore defines a putative ancestral eumetazoan linkage group
(PAL).  The complete Oxford grid showing all 13 PALs is shown in Table S7.2.
The conserved linkage is extensive, and accounts for a significant fraction of the ancestral
eumetazoan set.  Of the 4,402 ancestral eumetazoan gene families represented in the largest
anemone scaffolds and human segments (i.e., in the genomic regions large enough to permit
statistically significant analysis, and therefore eligible for consideration in our analysis), more
than 30% (1,336) participate in a conserved linkage group. This is a lower bound on the true
extent of the remnant ancient linkage groups, since our analysis is limited by the length of the
Nematostella scaffolds and the use of conservative statistical criteria.  A more sensitive approach
can assign more than twice as many ancestral genes to a PAL (32).   The 40 human segments that
show conserved synteny with Nematostella cover half of the human genome; within such human
segments, typically 40-50% of eumetazoan-derived genes have counterparts in syntenic

----- Page 17 (native) -----
Nematostella segments, and vice versa. This is a remarkable total, since any chromosomal
fusions and subsequent gene order scrambling on either the human or Nematostella lineage
during their ~750 million years of independent evolution would attenuate the signal for linkage as
seen, for example, in the reconstruction of the teleost chromosomes by comparing fish and
mammals (49).
The observation of conserved linkage groups is most easily explained as the remnants of large
ancestral chromosomal segments containing hundreds of genes that have evolved without
obvious constraint on gene order within each block.  Seven of the PALs link anemone scaffolds
to multiple regions of the human genome in a manner consistent with multiple large-scale
duplication events along the vertebrate lineage (reviewed, for example, in (53)).  These seven
PALs represent the ancestral (preduplication) linkage of these regions.  Five PALs link
Nematostella scaffolds to single human chromosome regions, which suggests that the vertebrates
specific duplicates of these segments have been lost or fused and dispersed among other
chromosomes (32).  The surprising extent of this conserved linkage suggests that either the
neutral rate of inter-chromosomal translocations is low (on the order of a few breaks/fusions per
chromosome since the eumetazoan ancestor, excluding intra-chromosomal rearrangements), or
that selection has acted to maintain linkage of large groups of genes for unknown reasons.
An ancestral linkage group of particular interest includes the eumetazoan Hox cluster of
homeobox transcription factors that regulate anterior-posterior identity in bilaterians.  Hox genes
in Nematostella and other cnidarians are also expressed in spatial patterns consistent with an
ancient role in embryonic development (54-56).    Tetrapods have four Hox clusters that arose by
duplication on the vertebrate stem -- HoxA (human chromosome 7p15.2), HoxB (17q21.32),

----- Page 18 (native) -----
HoxC (12q13.13), and HoxD (2q31.1) -- which all appear in the same eumetazoan PAL, linked to
eight Nematostella scaffolds (Figure 4d).  Nematostella has several clusters of homeobox genes
(56-58), but only those on scaffolds 3 and 61 are embedded within the ancestral eumetazoan Hox
context, providing independent support for the assignment of these homeobox genes as bona fide
Nematostella Hox genes (54, 56, 59).   Remarkably, we find that not only is the organization of
the Hox cluster itself preserved, but that there is an extensive block of 225 ancestral genes (Table
S7.3) that were linked to Hox in the eumetazoan ancestor and have (independently) retained that
linkage in both the modern human and anemone genomes.
Origins of eumetazoan genes
Where did the eumetazoan gene repertoire come from?  Nearly 80% (6,182/7,766) of the
ancestral eumetazoan genes have clearly identifiable relatives (i.e., proteins with significant
sequence homology and conserved domain architecture) outside of the animals, including fungi,
plants, slime molds, ciliates, or other species available from public datasets (32).  These are
evidently members of ancient eukaryotic gene families that were already established in the
unicellular ancestors of the metazoa, and are involved in core eukaryotic cellular functions
including amino acid, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism; small molecule and ion transport;
DNA replication, core transcriptional machinery, RNA processing, and translation; intracellular
vesicular trafficking and secretion; and structural and regulatory components of the eukaryotic
cytoskeleton.  Although these eumetazoan gene families are conserved with other eukaryotes,
animals have a unique complement due to family expansion/contraction on the eumetazoan stem. 
The eumetazoan genes of ancient eukaryotic ancestry are themselves descended from
approximately ~5,148 eukaryotic progenitors by nearly one thousand gene duplications along the

----- Page 19 (native) -----
eumetazoan stem, that is, after the early radiation of eukaryotes ~1100-1500 Mya (60) but prior
to the divergence of cnidarians and bilaterians (32).
The remaining 20% (1,584) of the ancestral eumetazoan gene set comprises animal novelties that
were apparently "invented" along the eumetazoan stem.   The mechanism for the creation of
"new" genes is obscure (e.g., (61)), but may involve gene duplication followed by bursts of rapid
sequence divergence (thus masking the similarity with related sister sequences) and/or de novo
recruitment of gene and/or non-coding fragments into functional transcription units - we
classified these eumetazoan novelties into three categories based on their origin (Figure 5a). 
The first and largest group ("type I" novelty) comprises animal genes that have no identifiable
relatives (with BLAST) outside of animals in the available sequence datasets, and accounts for
15% (1,186) of ancestral eumetazoan genes. These include important signaling factors, like the
secreted wingless (Wnt)  and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) families, and transcription factors,
including the T-box and mothers-against-decapentaplegic (SMAD) families (Table 5b). 
Interestingly, not only were these genes present in the eumetazoan ancestor, but they had already
duplicated and diversified on the eumetazoan stem to establish the subfamilies that, nearly 750
million years later, are still maintained in modern vertebrates.  (See for example the wnt family
(62).)  The diversification of these critical gene families occurred on the stem.
"Type II" novelties (2% of the eumetazoan complement, or 158 genes) incorporate "animal-only"
domains in combination with ancient eukaryotic sequence.  The ancestry of these genes can be
traced back to the eukaryotic radiation through their ancient domains, but the novel domains they
contain were evidently "invented" (or evolved into their recognizable animal form) and coupled

----- Page 20 (native) -----
to more ancient domains on the eumetazoan stem. For example, Notch proteins have two Notch
domains found only in metazoans in addition to ancient eukaryotic ankyrin and EGF domains;
focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is targeted to focal adhesions in eumetazoans because of the
addition of an animal specific focal adhesion targeting domain to the ancient kinase domain. 
Finally, "type III" novelties (3%, or 240 gene families) consist of animal genes whose domains
are all ancient (i.e., each found in other eukaryotes) but which occur in apparently unique
combination in eumetazoa relative to known non-animal genes (32) due to gene fusions and/or
domain shuffling events on the eumetazoan stem.  For example, the LIM-homeobox transcription
factors are the result of a fusion of the ancient LIM protein-protein interaction and homeobox
DNA-binding domains on the eumetazoan stem. While such "domain shuffling" (Patthy 1999)
events are relatively rare, they are disproportionately involved in characterized biochemical
pathways, perhaps by bringing together existing catalytic capabilities, localization and regulatory
domains into the same protein (Table S8.1).
Eumetazoan networks and pathways
How are the genes that were invented along the eumetazoan stem related to the organismal
novelties associated with Eumetazoa?  Satisfyingly, but perhaps not surprisingly, we find the
novel genes to be significantly enriched for signal transduction, cell communication and
adhesion, and developmental processes (32). The eumetazoan ancestor was the progenitor of all
extant animals with nervous systems, and genes with neuronal activities are abundant among its
novelties. Given that present-day cnidarians lack a clear mesoderm, it is at first glance surprising
that genes known to be involved in mesoderm development in bilaterians are also enriched
among eumetazoan novelties.  Yet we know that many of these genes are associated either with

----- Page 21 (native) -----
basic patterning functions and/or the regulation of cell migration and fate. The precise
deployment and interaction of these genes in the ancestral eumetazoan is therefore still a matter
of debate ((24), for reviews see (19, 23)).   Experiments in Nematostella, however, in comparison
with information about mesodermal networks in bilaterians, could in principle constrain the
ancestral genetic network and address whether or not the ancestor deployed these genes to
generate this key germ layer.
Individual "new" genes are by themselves unlikely to bring about the suite of features needed to
evolve animal characteristics from unicellular organisms.  Rather, we expect that to generate
organismal novelty such new genes must be integrated with other novel and existing genes to
evolve expanded or modified biochemical pathways and/or regulatory networks.  Given the
reconstructed eumetazoan genome and its various types of novel genes, we conclude by briefly
considering selected eumetazoan pathways and processes to see how novel animal genes were
incorporated into cellular and organismal functions.
Cell Adhesion
In Bilateria, the integrin pathway mediates signaling from the extracellular matrix (ECM) that
elicits various responses to modulate cell adhesion, motility, and the cell cycle (Giancotti and
Ruoslahti 1999). A detailed look at integrin signaling (Figure 5d) reveals that most of the core
components of the FAK and Fyn/Shc pathways were present in the eumetazoan ancestor. Various
ancient cytosolic proteins (talin, paxillin, Grb2, Sos and Crk) have been brought under the control
of two novel receptors, integrin a and integrin b (the former being a Type I novelty and the latter
a Type II novelty). Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a cytosolic component that appears as a Type
II novelty in eumetazoans and Calpain, a protease that regulates the aggregation of Talin, Paxillin

----- Page 22 (native) -----
and FAK around the receptor appears as a novel domain combination of ancient domains.
Caveolin, a membrane adapter that couples the integrin a subunit to Fyn is present in the
Nematostella genome and is a Type I novel protein.  Fyn itself is a more recent invention derived
on the tetrapod stem by gene duplication.
Cell-cell adhesion mediated by cell-ECM interactions is a hallmark of animal multicellularity
(63).  Basement membrane proteins such as collagen and laminin arose as Type II novelties along
the stem leading to the Eumetazoa, while others such as nidogen are novel pairings of ancient
domains (Figure 5c). Matrix metalloproteases also were invented as Type II novelties, whereas
guidance cues such as netrin and semaphorin that mediate adhesion are novelties with no clear
homology to ancient eukaryotic proteins. 
Signaling Pathways
Animals rely on cell-cell signaling for cellular coordination during and after development (64).
Various components of the Wnt and TGF-beta signaling pathways in the genome of Nematostella
have been reported ((24, 27, 28, 62, 65, 66)). We find that in both pathways, the secreted ligands
and their antagonists (wnt, SFRP, BMP, chordin etc.) are novelties (Figure 5b). Some, such as
Wnt, SFRP, dpp/BMP, activin and chordin are Type I novelties with no homology to proteins
from outgroups; some are Type II novelties (dickkopf) and some, such as tolloid are novel
pairings of ancient domains (Type III). The receptor in the Wnt pathway, frizzled, also arose as a
Type I eumetazoan novelty. Transcription factors that are activated downstream of Wnt signaling
are ancient, but the ones involved in TGF-beta signaling are novel. Type I receptors of the TGF-
beta pathway arose as a pairing of novel animal domains with ancient domains (Type II
novelties) and type II receptors turn out to be ancient eukaryotic kinase genes that were co-opted

----- Page 23 (native) -----
for this function.
The presence of essentially complete signal transduction pathways in the common gene set of
cnidarians and bilaterians strongly suggests that the integration of novel eumetazoan genes into
these systems was largely complete in the eumetazoan ancestor. A general trend in the evolution
of signaling pathways may have been the co-option of cytosolic signaling components into
pathways that could be regulated by newly invented ligands and receptors. For example, in the
case of FGF signaling, the interactions of ancient cytosolic components (e.g. Grb2, Sos, MAPK)
could be elaborated with the addition of novel proteins (e.g. FGF and Shc), or of novel domains
added to old proteins (e.g. Raf homolog) or novel pairings of old domains (e.g. FGFR and PLC-
gamma).
Emergence of the neuromuscular system
Cnidarians and ctenophores are the earliest branching metazoan phyla that have a nervous
system, though they lack overt centralization of the kind observed in bilaterians.   Numerous
genes known to be involved in neurogenesis, such as members of the homeobox and basic helix-
loop helix transcription factor families (Emx, Otp, Otx; achaete-scute), can be traced to ancient
eukaryotic genes with these signature domains. Some are novel pairings of ancient domains (such
as neuropilin and Lim-homeobox genes), some are parings of old domains with novel animal-
specific domains (such as Dsh, Arx, neuralized) and others are novel animal genes (e.g., Hes,
Gcm, netrin, semaphorins, dachsund). Certain enzymes important in synaptic transmission (e.g.
DOPA-beta monooxygenase) and some vesicular trafficking proteins (e.g. synaptophysin) appear
as completely novel (Type I) eumetazoan proteins. Regulatory subunits for ion channels
important in nerve conduction and muscular function can be Type I novelties (e.g. voltage

----- Page 24 (native) -----
dependent calcium channel beta subunit, potassium large conductance calcium-activated channel)
or Type III novelties (e.g. voltage dependent calcium channel alpha2/delta subunit). Various
components of the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DPC) in the sarcolemma such as
dystrophin, syntrophin, beta-dystrobrevin and beta-sarcoglycan are Type I novelties. Other
sarcomere proteins are Type II novelties (e.g. nebulin and tropomodulin). This diversity of
origins of genes with different roles in the neuromuscular system suggests that tracing the
evolution of nerves and muscle will require detailed studies of the functions of these genes in
organisms at the base of the metazoan tree.
Concluding remarks
Modern animal genomes retain features inherited from the eumetazoan ancestor that have been
elaborated on, and sometimes overwritten by, subsequent evolutionary elaborations and
simplifications.  By comparing genomes, we can infer conserved ancestral features and
characterize the gene- and genome-level changes that occurred during the evolution of different
lineages. Here we have compared the genomes of the sea anemone and diverse bilaterians, both
to infer the content and organization of the genome of the eumetazoan ancestor, and to trace the
origins of uniquely animal features.  In many ways, the ancestral genome was not so different
from ours; it was intron rich, and contained nearly complete "toolkits" for animal biochemistry
and development, which can now be recognized as pan-eumetazoan, as well as the core gene set
required to execute sophisticated neural and muscular function.  Remarkably, the ancestor had
blocks of  linked genes that remain together in the modern human and anemone genomes -- the
oldest known conserved synteny outside of prokaryotic operons.  While fruit flies and soil
nematodes have proven to be exquisite model systems for dissecting the genetic underpinnings of

----- Page 25 (native) -----
metazoan development and physiology, their genomes are relatively poor models for the ancestral
eumetazoan genome, having lost introns, genes, and gene linkages.
The eumetazoan ancestor possessed over fifteen hundred genes that are apparently novel relative
to other eukaryotic kingdoms.  Where did these genes come from?  Some are the result of domain
shuffling, bringing together on the animal stem new combinations of domains that are shared
with other eukaryotes.  But a significant number of animal-specific genes contain sequences with
no readily recognizable counterparts outside of animals; these may have arisen by sequence
divergence from ancient eukaryotic genes, but the trail is obscured by deep time. While we can
crudely assign the origins of these genes to the eumetazoan stem, this remains somewhat
unsatisfying.  The forthcoming genomes of sponges, placozoans, and choanoflagellates will allow
more precise dating of the origins and diversification of modern eumetazoan gene families, but
this will not directly reveal the mechanisms for new gene creation.   Presumably many of these
novelties will ultimately be traced back, through deep sequence or structural comparisons, to
ancient genes that underwent extreme "tinkering."
The eumetazoan progenitor was more than just a collection of genes.  How did these genes
function together within the ancestor?  Unfortunately, we cannot read from the genome the nature
of its gene- and protein-regulatory interactions and networks.  This is particularly vexing as it is
becoming clear -- especially given the apparent universality of the eumetazoan toolkit -- that gene
regulatory changes can also play a central role in generating novelties, allowing co-option of
ancestral genes and networks to new functions (67).  Nematostella and its genome, however,
provide a platform for testing hypotheses about the nature of ancestral eumetazoan pathways and

----- Page 26 (native) -----
interactions, using the basic principle of evolutionary developmental biology: processes that are
conserved between living species were likely functional in their common ancestor.   Of particular
interest are the processes that give rise to body axes, germ layers, and differentiated cell types
like nerve and muscle, as well as the mechanisms that maintain these cells and their interactions
through the growth and repair of the organism. 
Although we have focused our initial analysis of the Nematostella genome on deciphering the
eumetazoan ancestor, and therefore on the similarities between anemone and bilaterian genomes,
their differences are also of interest, and the sequence will of course be valuable as a reference
for molecular studies of  cnidarian biology, especially when combined with the soon-to-be-
available genome of Hydra to bracket the phylum.  An enduring mystery is the development of
the unique stinging cells that define the Cnidaria.  Of particular interest is an improved
understanding of the biology of modern corals that are, like Nematostella, anthozoan cnidarians. 
The relationship of these stony corals with their photosynthetic symbionts is instrumental in the
health of coral reefs around the world -- and the continuing maintenance of the rich animal
diversity that descended from the eumetazoan ancestor.

Supplement S1
Additional background information on Nematostella vectensis.
The starlet sea anemone Nematostella vectensis (Family: Edwardsiidae) is a burrowing, brackish-water,
solitary sea anemone with a worldwide distribution (1, 2). Self-sustaining laboratory cultures can be
maintained year-round in artificial seawater, with daily feedings of brine shrimp (3, 4). While sexes are
separate, they are not obviously morphologically distinguishable.  Nematostella is unique among
cnidarians in that it can be induced to spawn repeatedly on a regular cycle in the laboratory to produce
large numbers of gametes that can be manipulated by simple in vitro fertilization methods (4).
Development occurs via planula larvae that emerge from the jelly of the egg mass within two days at
20-25C (5-6 days at 18C) (4).  Planulae are formed by gastrulation via invagination, and have an apical
tuft at one end of the animal. A single planula larva is about 250 !m in length and consists of over
10,000 cells (Figure 3A-I). Metamorphosis into a four-tentacled juvenile polyp with two mesenteries
(partitions that partially divide the gut and increase its surface area, also providing pouches for the
production and storage of gametes) takes about a week, with sexual maturity reached in 3-4 months. 
Mature adults are hollow tubes typically 5-10 cm in length, with an open (oral) end encircled by 10-20
tentacles a few cm long, and a closed (aboral) end (Figure 2). The animals are carnivorous, capturing
and consuming plankton, including small animals and their larvae, using tentacles and the characteristic
stinging cells of cnidarians, which inject neurotoxin into prey. 
Individual animals have been maintained in the laboratory for over fifteen years (C. Hand, private
communication). Asexual reproduction can be induced by tying a fine thread around the body tube. 
Within a few days, the animal will separate into two individuals, producing both a new mouth and basal
disc.  As with other cnidarians, Nematostella possesses considerable regenerative abilities,
reconstituting a complete and properly proportioned adult from only a part of the animal.  Tentacles can
also regrow when cut.  It is not known how tentacle number or body tube length is regulated, either in
regeneration or embryogenesis.
Table S1.1 contains a partial list of the merits of Nematostella as a model organism.
 
Figure 1 Methods
Nematocyst staining (Figure 1g): (Methods adapted from (5)) Juvenile and small adult Nematostella
polyps were relaxed in 7.14% MgCl2 in dH2O for ten minutes and then washed quickly three times in
1X PBS with 10mM EDTA. They were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 1X PBS with 10mM EDTA
for one hour at 4oC. After washing three times for five minutes each in 1X PBS with 10mM EDTA, the
animals were stained in a 200uM DAPI solution in 1X PBS for thirty minutes. Animals were mounted in
70% glycerol in Ptw after washing three times for five minutes each in 1X PBS with 10mM EDTA.
In situ hybridization (Figures 1 j,k): In situ hybridization was carried out as previously described (6).

Source material for genome sequencing
Genomic DNA was prepared in the laboratory of Ulrich Technau from larval F1 progeny of CH2 males

----- Page 48 (native) -----
and CH6 females.  These parental strains – clones of which are widely available today in at least four
laboratories and can be readily redistributed – are from the original colony established and maintained
by Cadet Hand at the Bodega Bay Marine Laboratory in the early 1990’s (3).    Because commensals or
symbionts have been reported for Nematostella, gametic or embryonic DNA is preferred to avoid
contamination from symbionts and/or undigested food.  DNA from the same preparation was used to
create a BAC library, described below.  Thanks to asexual reproduction, the haplotypes represented in
the draft genome sequence and BAC library [see below] can be propagated indefinitely.
CHORI BAC library
A Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) library was produced by Drs. Baoli Zhu and Pieter de Jong at
the Children’s Hospital Oakland Research Institute (CHORI).  This library provides a ten-fold coverage
of the genome. The average size of the inserts in the library is 168 kb. Funding for construction of the
library was provided by a grant from the NSF (Robert Steele, PI, Ulrich Technau, Co-PI).  The library is
available through the CHORI BACPAC resource (deJong et al).  More information can be found at
http://bacpac.chori.org/library.php?id=219. 
Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) Sequencing and Assembly.
The genome of Nematostella vectensis was sequenced and assembled by whole genome shotgun (WGS)
(7) as previously described (8).  Briefly, genomic DNA prepared as described above was used to create
shotgun libraries with inserts of approximately 3,000 bp, 6,500 bp and 35,000 bp.  The libraries used,
their mean insert sizes, and the numbers of reads sequenced are listed in Table S2.1.  The shotgun
reads were trimmed of low quality and vector-derived sequence, and assembled using JAZZ(8, 9). 
Approximately one third of the shotgun reads are composed entirely of high copy-number repeat
sequences, and are therefore masked at the alignment stage of JAZZ, and therefor remain
unassembled.  Table S2.2 lists 10 abundant tandemly-repeated sequences in the shotgun dataset which
together account for 32% of shotgun reads.
The assembled genome contains a total of 59,124 contiguous reconstructed sequences ("contigs") with
a total length of 297 million base pairs (Mbp) and 10,804 "scaffolds", or reconstructed fragments of the
genome that include gaps of unknown sequence, with a total length of 356 Mbp.  Half of the contig
sequence is contained in the largest 3,617 contigs, which are all at least 19,835 bp in length (N50). 
Half of the total scaffold sequence is contributed by the largest 181 scaffolds, which are each at least
472 Kbp in length.
Approximately 0.8% of positions in the assembly contain a polymorphic site (Figure S2.1), and we
estimate that the mean pairwise variation between the four haplotypes represented in the libraries is
0.64 % (Figure S2.2).
Expressed sequence tag (EST) library preparation, sequencing, and assembly
A mixed stage cDNA library for Nematostella was prepared in the laboratory of Ulrich Technau, cloning
polyA RNA from unfertilized eggs through metamorphosis into pSPORT 6.1.  The library contains 56
million colony forming units (cfu) at a concentration of 4.7 million cfu/ml. The average insert size of the
library is 1.96 kb, with greater than 99.5% recombinant, and an estimated 75% full length based on
pilot sequencing.  Of 1,152 sample sequences, 99.9% were passing, and 80% possessed significant
BLASTX hits (E-value < 1E-5). 780 contigs were produced, with 680 single clones; the most abundant
sequence was EF-1a, found in 3% of the sample, indicating that even without normalization this library

----- Page 49 (native) -----
has a relatively low level of redundancy. 
To enable the characterization of gene structures and to provide resources for further study, 88,704
cDNA clones from the library were end-sequenced to provide 146,095 expressed sequence tags (ESTs). 
The ESTs were clustered and assembled into 30,813 contigs via the JGI EST pipeline.  Of these, 7,925
contigs were found to have a complete (start codon to stop codon) open reading frame (ORFs) of at
least 450 bp.  These putatively full-length EST contigs were aligned to the assembled WGS scaffolds
using BLAT(10) (-maxIntron=100000 -extendThroughN). 
To evaluate the completeness of the WGS assembly with respect to this collection of ESTs, we
considered the number of putative full length EST contigs aligned to the genome at varying levels of
completeness.  For alignments of at least 95% sequence identity, 7,738 (97.6%) had an alignment
spanning at least 25% of the length of the EST contig,  7,557 (95.4%) had an alignment spanning at
least 75% of the length of the EST contig, and 7,193 (90.8%) had an alignment spanning at least 95%
of the length of the EST contig.  138 of the 222 EST contigs that lacked an alignment over at least 50%
of their length had an identifiable alignment to human refseq genes by BLASTP(11) (-e 1e-5), indicating
that they are likely to represent bona fide protein-coding transcripts rather artifactual sequence. 
Others may be contaminants of the EST library, or novel genes.
839 (11.1%) of the EST contigs had alignments of at least 95% identity spanning at least 75% of their
length with multiple locations in the assembly, indicating that up to approximately 10% of the non-
repetitive genome may be represented redundantly in the assembly.
For Mnemiopsis leidyi, a cDNA library was created from total RNA prepared from gastrual stage
embryos and reversed transcribed with oligo dT primers and the  ZAP cDNA Synthesis Kit (Stratagene)
by Kevin Pang and Mark Martindale.  cDNA fragments with sizes ranging from ~500-2000 base pairs
were cloned into pBluescript SK, and 15,360 paired clone end sequences were generated at JGI.
Repeat sequences reconstructed from unassembled WGS reads
Repeats were identified by assembling 16-mers (DNA sequences of length 16 bp) that frequently
occurred in both ends of a sample of 50,000 fosmid clones from the ASYG library.  Any 16-mers that
occurred in both ends of at least 20 clones were used in the assemblies.  The assemblies were
performed using juggernaut.pl, a script developed for this purpose.  tRNAScan-SE(12) was used to look
for tRNAs and BLASTN(11) against nr and Repbase(13) to identify the 5S,18S,28S,U2,U6 RNAs, and
two Nematostella transposons (see below).  The five elements lacking notes are not identified by either
of these methods.
 
The tandem array sizes are estimated by calculating the probability that a fosmid end matches the
repeat given that its sister does.  This probability can be used to estimate the expected array size (an
average over multiple arrays in some cases) in terms of the mean fosmid length (37kb).  These
estimates depend on the assumptions of "normal" cloning behavior for these repetitive sequences. 
10 families of tandemly repeated sequences were identified which occur in arrays longer than fosmid-
length and account for 32% of the WGS data set.  The key characteristics of these repeats are
described in Table S2.2.  See the file juggernaut.fasta for the complete sequences of these 10
elements.

Transposable elements in the sea anemone genome
Transposable elements (TEs) constitute more than 26% of the assembled sea anemone genome (Table
S2.3) and belong to  >500 families. These families are composed of a small number of copies (from 1
to ~5,000) and they all are relatively young: elements from the oldest families are less than 15%
divergent from their consensus sequences and their ORFs coding for transposases, reverse
transcriptases, and other transposon-specific proteins are not severely damaged by mutations.
In terms of their bulk contribution to the genome size, DNA transposons are fourfold more abundant
than retrotransposons (Table S2.3).  However, while different classes of anemone retrotransposons,
including Gypsy, DIRS, Penelope, and CR1, are composed of more than 50-100 families each, different
classes of autonomous DNA transposons are represented by just a few families.  It appears that
retrotransposition of retrotransposons, despite their high diversity, has not been as efficient as
propagation of DNA transposons in the anemone genome.
The variety of different types of DNA transposons found in the anemone genome is the highest among
eukaryotic species studied so far. Representatives of all reported superfamilies and groups of eukaryotic
DNA transposons  (14-16), excluding the Transib superfamily and the Mariner group of the Mariner
superfamily, are present in the anemone genome. Even, En/Spm (also called CACTA) and transposons,
which were believed to populate plants genomes only (14), reside in the anemone genome. While the
anemone 10,632-bp EnSpm-1_NV and 9,347-bp EnSpm-2_NV transposons encode transposases
(TPase) similar to the plant En/Spm TPase and are flanked by 3-bp targets site duplications typical for
known En/Spm elements, their 5’-CACAG termini differ from the 5’-CACTA termini of the plant
transposons.
Over 3% of the anemone genome is made of fossilized copies of self-synthesized Polinton DNA
transposons whose transposition depends on the Polinton-encoded DNA polymerase and integrase (17).
It makes Nematostella the first metazoan with Polintons constituting a substantial portion of the
genome (17).
Remarkably, the sea anemone genome is a safe haven for unusual transposons that have never been
seen before. For instance, Troyka, a novel type of LTR retrotransposons distantly related to the Gypsy
superfamily, is characterized by 3-bp target site duplications (TSDs), while all known LTR
retrotransposons, including retroviruses, are defined by 4-6 bp TSDs (14). Among DNA transposons,
the hAT superfamily is well-known for TSDs that are always 8 bp long (14). However, the sea anemone
genome, in addition to the canonical hAT transposons contains two novel groups, hAT5 and hAT6,
characterized by 5- and 6-bp TSDs, respectively. Importantly, using reverse transcriptase/integrase and
transposase encoded by the anemone Troyka, hAT5, and hAT6 transposons as queries in TBLASTN
searches against GenBank DNA sequences, we found that proteins closest to the queries (>30% protein
identity) are encoded by TEs characterized by the same unusual lengths of TSDs. For instance, Troyka
retrotransposons are present also in sea urchin, and the hAT5 and hAT6 transposons are wide spread in
sea urchin, sea squirts and lancelet.
The anemone genome is also populated by a novel superfamily of eukaryotic “cut and paste” DNA

----- Page 51 (native) -----
transposons, called IS4EU, characterized by their TPase distantly related to the bacterial IS4 TPase.
Following identification of the IS4EU TEs in the anemone genome, members of this superfamily have
been also found in other species, including lancelet.
Analyzing anemone TEs, we have also advanced in our understanding of evolution of non-LTR
retrotransposons (Fig. S2.1). For instance, the anemone genome harbors two families of Tx1-like non-
LTR retrotransposons, Tx1-1_NV and Tx1-2_NV, inserted in 5S rRNA and U2 smRNA, respectively, at
target sites identical to those of different Tx1 elements in fish (18), frog and lancelet. We suggest that
Tx1-like elements form a novel clade of non-LTR retrotransposons differing from the L1 clade elements
by the strong target-site specificity. 
RTE is another clade of non-LTR retrotransposons first described a few years ago (14, 19).  All known
RTE elements, including those in plants, insects, nematodes, and vertebrates, contain only one ORF and
are characterized by extremely frequent 5’ truncations of the RTE elements during their
retrotransposition. Here, we show that the anemone genome contains several families of RTE-like
elements, RTEX in Fig. S2.1, which are longer than canonical RTE elements and contain an additional
ORF at their 5’ terminal portion that codes for the esterase domain, analogously to elements from the
CR1/L2 clade (20). 
Transposable Element Analysis Methods
Transposable elements were identified using WU-BLAST (http://blast.wustl.edu) and its implementation
in CENSOR (http://girinst.org/censor/). First, we detected all fragments of the anemone genome coding
for proteins similar to transposases, reverse transcriptases, and DNA polymerases representing all
known classes of TEs. The detected DNA sequences have been clustered based on their pairwise
identities by using BLASTclust (standalone NCBI BLAST(11)). Each cluster has been treated as a
potential family of TEs described by its consensus sequence. The consensus sequences were built
automatically based on multiple alignments of the cluster sequences expanded in both directions and
manually modified based on structural characteristics of known TEs.  Using WU-BLAST/CENSOR we
identified fragments of the anemone genome similar to the consensus sequences that were considered
as copies of TEs. Second, given the identified consensus sequences, we detected automatically
insertions longer than 50-bp present in the identified copies of the protein-coding TEs. The insertions
have been treated as potential TEs, clustered based on their pairwise DNA identities and replaced by
their consensus sequences built for each cluster. After manual refinements of the consensus sequences,
the identified families of TEs were classified based on their structural hallmarks, including target site
duplications, terminal repeats, encoded proteins and similarities to TEs classified previously.  Identified
TEs are deposited in Repbase (13).

Gene prediction and quality control
The genome of Nematostella vectensis includes 27,273 predicted gene models built using the JGI
Annotation Pipeline, described below. The genomic sequence, predicted genes and annotations of
Nematostella, together with available evidence, are available at the JGI Genome Portal
(www.jgi.doe.gov/Nematostella)
The JGI Annotation Pipeline was used for annotation of the v1.0 Nematostella assembly described here.
The pipeline includes the following annotation steps: (1) repeat masking, (2) mapping ESTs, full length
cDNAs, and putative full length genes, (3) gene prediction using several methods, (4) protein

----- Page 52 (native) -----
annotation using several methods, and (5) combining gene predictions into a non redundant
representative set of gene models, which are subject to genome-scale analysis.
Transposons were masked in the Nematostella assembly using RepeatMasker (21) tools and a custom
library of manually curated repeats (available upon request from V. Kapitonov). 146,095 ESTs were
clustered into 30,813 consensus sequences and both individual ESTs and consensus sequences were
mapped onto genome assembly using BLAT(10).
Gene predictors used for annotation of Nematostella v1.0 included ab initio FGENESH (22), homology-
based FGENESH+ (22), homology-based GENEWISE (23), and EST-based ESTEXT (Grigoriev,
unpublished).
A set of 1,678 genes derived from EST clusters with a putative full length ORF was directly mapped to
the genomic sequence to build gene models.  FGENESH was trained on this set to achieve sensitivity
and specificity of 81% and 80%, respectively. To generate homology-based gene models, proteins from
the NCBI NR database were aligned against genomic sequence using BlastX(11). High quality seed
proteins were then used to build models using FEGENESH+ and GENEWISE. GENEWISE gene models
were then filtered to remove models with frameshifts and internal stop-codons and extended to include
start and stop codons where possible. FGENESH, FGENESH+ and GENEWISE gene models were then
processed using ESTEXT to correct them according to splicing patterns observed in available ESTs and
to extend 3’ and 5’ UTR of the genes.
All gene models were annotated by homology to other proteins from NCBI NR, SwissProt and KEGG
databases. Using InterproScan (24) we predicted proteins domains. Using both these sources of
information, annotation of each protein was mapped to the terms of Gene Ontology (25), KOG clusters
of orthologs (26), and mapped to KEGG pathways (27).
The large set of all predicted models was reduced to a non-redundant set of 27,273  representative
models (Filtered Models), where every locus is described by a single best gene model according to the
criteria of homology and EST support. For this set of representative gene models we assigned GO  (25)
terms to 12,786 proteins, 16,625 (78%) proteins to KOG clusters (26), and 695 distinct EC numbers
were assigned to 2,822 proteins mapped to KEGG pathways (27).  Table S3.1 summarizes the set of
predicted genes.
The data are available from JGI Genome Portal (www.jgi.doe.gov/Nematostella) and from the GenBank
under accession numbers XXXXXXXXXXXXX
 
Gene Content
Human Genes Sharing Ancestry with Nematostella Genes
To determine the number of genes in the Nematostella genome, we estimated how many of the 27,273
predicted gene models represent unique genes in the genome, as opposed to spurious gene predictions,
fragmentary gene models, pseudogenes or unrecognized transposable element sequence.  First, the
Nematostella gene models were divided into categories based on the quality of their hits to the human
proteome.  Specifically we define the "best C-value", for each Nematostella gene, to be the ratio of the
BLAST score of its best hit to the human genome to the highest BLAST score of the best-hitting human
gene to any Nematostella gene.  The number of genes with best C-value greater than or equal to Cmin,
for Cmin from 0 to 1, is plotted in Figure S3.1 for two choices of BLAST e-value threshold.  This value is
by construction equal to 1 for genes with a mutual best, and the human and nematostella curves
converge at Cmin=1 for each choise of e-value.  At the opposite extreme of Cmin=0, the curves reach
the total number of genes with detectable alignment in the other genome.

----- Page 53 (native) -----
If a species has undergone extensive "paralog-formation', for example by a genome duplication relative
to the other, we will expect the curve for genes of the 'duplicated' species hitting genes of the
'unduplicated' species being above the vice versa, for ranges 0.8 <= Cmin <1, i.e. the 'co-orthologs'
range, as we observe for human in the plot.
If the curve for a species does not flatten as Cmin -> 0 this means that there are many genes in that
species having low best C-values, which is what we expect for pseudogenes and/or transposons where
partial gene predictions have been made. For Nematostella, this curve shows a large excess, exceeding
the human curve for values of Cmin > 0.5, while falling below human at high Cmin values.  This type of
reversal does not appear in human-Drosophila, human-Caenorhabditis , or Drosophila-Caenorhabditis
comparisons (data not shown).
To asses whether the excess of gene models with low best C-value in Nematostella reflect the
contribution of a large number of small, fragmentary models and pseudogenes, 60 Nematostella genes
were subjected to a detailed manual review.  Twenty genes were selected at random from the JGI
Nematostella Filtered Models version 1.0 ("FM1.0 set") in each of the following categories:
1) BCV (best C-value to human) = 0, meaning no BLAST hit to human. 5486 of the FM1.0 set have BCV
= 0.
2) 0 < BCV < 0.4. 4889 of the FM1.0 set.
3) BCV >= 0.4. 18274 of the FM1.0 set.
Manual review is by definition somewhat subjective, but using conservative criteria, i.e. avoiding
dismissing too many genes, the results of the sampling indicate that about one third of all genes in the
FM1.0 set could be expected to be rejected by manual reviews.
Category 1), 8 of the 20 were deemed "real genes", i.e. from the total number of genes with BCV = 0
we would expect ~ 0.4 * 5489 = 2194 genes to "pass manual scrutiny". Note that 15 of the 20 in this
category have 1 or 2 exons.
Category 2). 10 of 20 were deemed real.  11 of the 20 have 1 or 2 exons. Predicted # genes to pass
manual review: 4889 * 0.5 = 2445
Category 3). These are high BCV genes, 13 of which have BCV > 0.8. Here, 15 of the 20 are thought to
be real genes. In some cases, it looked like two gene models should be merged, and I tried roughly to
call a gene here every other time, to approximately get the right gene count. From the counts here, we
would expect ~ 0.75 * 18274 = 13706 genes in this category.
Adding up these expected numbers gives us an estimate of 18,345 bona fide Nematostella genes. Even
this may be an overestimate, since quite a few of the genes with lower c-values are at the edges of
short scaffolds, and their other half may be picked up by another scaffold, causing 2 annotations for a
single gene.
Additional observations on the Nematostella proteome
• The human genome has more genes with a mutual best hit in Nematostella than in the
proteomes of Ciona, fruit flies or nematodes. (Figure S3.2)
• The Nematostella genome contains many protines with domain architectures (combinations of
PFAM domains) that are shared exclusively with vertebrate genes.  (Figure S3.3)
• Of the PFAM domains present in human, mouse, dog, chicken, frog and fugu, Nematostella has

----- Page 54 (native) -----
more in common than any of Ciona, fruit fly, or nematode.  (Figure S3.4)
• There are 5 large clusters of short proteins (around ~100aa), each comprising 55-74 members
with weak similarity to hypothetical short ORFs from fungi (28)
• There are 242 clusters of tandemly duplicated genes, comprising 2-13 members, with annotated
Pfam domains, which apparently were duplicated after split of bilateria
• There are 9 neurotoxins genes, with an anemone neurotoxin domain (PF0076) previously found
only in the Cnidaria, but not previously in Nematostella, and 5 copies of green fluorescent
protein (PF01353), originally found in jellyfish and predominantly found in Cnidaria.
• 16 Pfam domains previously exclusively found only in vertebrates, but not in other phyla of
bilateria (or other eukaryotes), are present in Nematostella genome, including:
        PF01500 -   Keratin, high sulfur B2 protein                                          
        PF00040  -  Fibronectin type II domain
        PF06954 -   Resistin
        PF06990 -   Galactose-3-O-sulfotransferase
        PF05038 -   Cytochrome b558 alpha-subunit
Lineage Specific Expansions
We identified 809 “recent” tandem expansions in the Nematostella genome, comprising 1,854 protein-
coding genes. A similar algorithm applied to the ENSEMBL annotation of the human genome detected
504 recent expansions with 1,317 genes. The algorithm is as follows: first, all genes on chromosomes
or scaffolds with three or more annotated genes were numbered in occurring order. From an all-
against-all Smith-Waterman alignment of these peptides, all hits with greater than 60% identity and
with at least 25 conserved four-fold degenerate codons were retained. This filtering step helps eliminate
pseudogenes and spurious hits of low-complexity regions, and allows a divergence epoch estimate for
the pair based on four-fold degenerate transversion frequency (4DTv)(29).  Since our focus is on
expansions specific to the nematostella lineage, we only consider hits with 4DTv < 0.2, i.e. 20% or less
observed transversions at four-fold degenerate 3rd codon positions. Extrapolating from vertebrate
calibrations, this corresponds to gene duplications no older than 150-200 million years. For comparison,
human-mouse orthologs have typical 4DTv distances of ~ 0.15, and human-opossum have 4DTv ~ 0.26
(data not shown).
Next, the scaffolds were scanned for pairwise hits under the above criteria with no more than three
unrelated genes separating them. This allows for intervening spurious gene models as well as small-
scale inversions. Finally, all such pairs with one of the genes being within three genes of a member of
another pair were clustered in a single-linkage fashion. To assess the probability of detecting tandem
expansions by chance, we repeated this approach on versions of the human and nematostella gene sets
in which the gene order had been randomly scrambled. We found a single spurious 2-member cluster in
nematostella and four in human. Hence, we expect the false positive rate of this approach to be less
than 1%.
In order to assess to what extent these relatively recent expansions have been retained by positive
selection, and to compare the types of expansions found in Nematostella to those in vertebrates, we
performed the following analysis:  first, we scanned all of the genes in the human and Nematostella
gene sets for PFAM-A domains using hmmpfam(30). We were able to assign one or more PFAM domains
to 15,102 human genes and 12,202 Nematostella genes. We then formulated a neutral-evolution
hypothesis that any gene has an equal probability of getting duplicated and fixed in the population. For
genes with a certain domain we can then test the validity of this hypothesis by comparing the
frequencies of such genes in the recent expansions to the overall frequency. For example, the number
of recently created genes in Nematostella containing a PF000001 seven transmembrane family
(rhodopsin family) domain is 33 (subtracting one “seed” member of each tandem cluster). Since 779 of
the 12,202 Nematostella genes contain this domain, the expected number in the recently expanded set
(with a total of 572 genes with PFAM domains) under the neutral hypothesis is 36.5 +- 5.8, where the
binomial approximation has been used since the recent genes constitutes a small fraction of the total

----- Page 55 (native) -----
genes in both species. Hence, in Nematostella, there is no evidence for recent selection for retention of
new genes greated by tandem duplication with PF000001. In the human genome, on the other hand,
112 such genes are observed, with an expected value of 29 +- 5.3, consistent with a strong recent
selective retention of such receptors (olfactory and visual) within vertebrates or mammals. Tables S3.3
(Nematostella) and S3.4 (human) show all PFAM domains found in at least four genes in recent tandem
expansions, and with a frequency of at least 3 sigma above the expected frequency under the neutral
hypothesis. In general, the gene families showing strong expansions along the two lineages are
different. In addition to olfactory and taste receptors, the human genome shows strong recent
preference of C2H2 zinc finger genes with a KRAB domain, keratin, and immune defence proteins. This
newly acquired repertoire almost certainly plays a key role in defining vertebrates and mammals.
Similarily, the genes listed in Table S3.3 can be hypothesized to play a significant role in distinguishing
Nematostella. Note that this analysis is biased towards vertebrates, for which more domains have been
characterized.
Supplement S4
Construction and characterization of eumetazoan gene families
To understand gene creation and duplication we designed a phylogenetically informed clustering
algorithm which produces clusters at the base (most distant in time) and tip (most recent point) of a
given internal branch (stem) of the species tree.  Each cluster is composed of a group of modern genes
that are the offspring of one gene in the common ancestor.  Our algorithm takes as input:
a) The genomes that have arisen as descendants from our stem of interest.  These are our in-group
genomes.
b) Other genomes which serve as phylogenetic out-groups.
c) Pairwise alignment scores for all pairs of genes in the in- and out-groups.
d) Any previous clusterings made of the in-group genomes we want to preserve.
From this data our algorithm operates as follows:
i)  A graph is made where each node is an in-group gene.  Edges are added if two genes are mutual
best hits between species.  Edges are also added if two genes are in any clusters in input (d).
ii) A single linkage clustering is done of the graph.  This represents the clusters at the tip of our stem. 
The mutual best hits captures the likely orthologs between the organisms while the clusters passed in
as input (d) captures the paralogs from the stems emanating from the tip of the current stem of
interest.
iii)  For each cluster made in (ii), the top m hits to the out-groups are found where m = twice the
number of out-groups.  This collection of out-group genes is called the potential blockers for this
cluster.
iv) Two clusters from (ii) are merged if they share at least one potential blocker and for every potential
blocker the genes with which it aligns are closer [by BLAST score] to each other than either is to its
potential blocker.  This gives us a set of clusters that existed at the base of our stem of interest.
 
Blastp was run using BLOSUM45, evalue cutoff 0.001, and filtering was turned off. Only the top 1500
hits were considered if more hits passed these criteria.  The genomes used are as follows:

Phylogenetic analysis of metazoa
We compared predicted protein sequences from Nematostella to those from other metazoan and out-
group genomes, and find that Nematostella genes are more similar to vertebrate genes than to fly and
nematode genes using bayesian branch length estimation and an analysis of percent sequence identity. 
((31) came to the same conclusion using ESTs and BLAST e-value to measure similarity.)  Of the 7,766
ancestral metaozan gene clusters, 1,619 are composed of a single gene from each of the six
representative metazoan genomes listed in Supplement S4:  human, fish, frog, Nematostella, fruit fly
and nematode.  Starting with this set of apparently single-copy genes in these six genomes, we
searched six additional complete or partial genome sequence data sets (of a tunicate, a gastropod
mollusk, a hydrozoan cnidarian, a choanoflagellate, a sponge, and yeast), and a collection of ESTs from
the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi (see Table S5.1 for a list of data sources) for orthologous genes,
making a total of twelve whole genome data sets, plus the EST-derived sequences from Mnemiopsis. 
For each additional genome, if a mutual-best hit existed to the human gene in the cluster, that gene
was identified as an ortholog, and added to the cluster.  We compared the results obtained with this set
with those obtained using Nematostella rather than human as the anchor for identifying orthologs, and
found that it did not change the results.  By this method, 337 ortholog sets were identified that had one
gene representing each of the twelve whole genome datasets.  Only nine ortholog sets contained one
gene from each of the twelve whole genomes plus a Mnemiopsis sequence.
We constructed two concatenated multiple sequence alignments from the identified orthologs: one with
and one without the ctenophore sequence.  In each case, multiple sequence alignments for each
orthologous set were computed with MUSCLE(32), and well-aligned regions extracted with
GBLOCKS(33) using conservative settings (all available sequences in an orthologous group were
required to be well aligned at the start and the end of each extracted block: -b1=N -b2=N, where N is
equal to the number of sequences in the alignment.).  We constructed two concatenated multiple
alignments for investigating metazoan phylogeny and relative rates of protein sequence evolution
among the different lineages.  The first (Alignment 1) excludes sequence from the Mnemiopsis ESTs,
and includes only the 337 ortholog sets with representation from each of the other twelve genomes. 
The second (Alignment 2) was compiled from the multiple alignments including the Mnemiopsis data
and includes all ortholog sets with twelve or thirteen members, plus all ortholog sets including a
Mnemiopsis sequence. 
Alignment 1 consists of 19,563 columns, with no missing data.  This data matrix was analyzed using
mrbayes version 3.1.2(34, 35), using a the WAG(36) model of protein evolution, a Gamma distribution
of rate variation among sites, approximated by four rate categories, and a category for invariant sites. 
Multiple runs from different starting topologies all converged on the same topology, branch lengths and
posterior probabilities for protein evolution model parameters within approximately 10,000 monte carlo
iterations.  The mean and variance of the posterior probabilities for total tree length, Gamma
distribution shape parameter alpha and the fraction of invariable sites were 2.278 +- 0.001, 0.818 +-

----- Page 57 (native) -----
0.001, and 0.2291 +- 0.0001, respectively.  Figure S5.1 shows the consensus tree topology and branch
lengths.  All nodes were resolved as shown in 100% of the samples trees.  The sequences of the genes
used in Alignment 1 are available in FASTA format in S5.fasta.
Alignment 2 consists of 19,977 columns, however only 2272 columns contain Mnemiopsis sequence.  To
test whether this data could be used to shed light additional light on the phylogenetic relationships
among cnidarians, ctenophores and bilateria, we submitted this dataset to a maximum likelihood
analysis using the PHYLIP package's PROML program(37), and compared the likelihood scores of three
topologies:  ctenophores sister to cnidarians+bilaterians, ctenophores sister to bilaterians, and
ctenophores sister to cnidarians.  Of these, the first had the highest likelihood score, but it was not
significantly better than the second in a Shimodaira-Hasegawa test.  The branch lengths for the tree
shown in Figure 2 were estimated using PROML, for the defined topology illustrated, with a trifurcation
at the cnidarian/ctenophore/bilaterian divergence.
To make an extremely rough estimate of divergence time between bilaterians and cnidarians, we
interpolated following Dawkins (38) between recent molecular clock estimates(39) of the timing of the
protostome-deuterostome (95% confidence interval: 640-760 Mya) and  choanoflagellate-metazoan
(95% CI: 760-960 Mya) divergences.  We see from Figure 2b that the cnidarian-bilaterian split lies
~30% of the way between these two nodes (adopting the midpoint rooting as shown), suggesting that
the eumetazoan ancestor lived between 670 and 820 Mya.
Figure S5.2 shows a more direct way the greater similarity between human and Nematostella proteins
than between human and fly/nematode proteins.
Supplement S6
Intron Splice Site Conservation
To study intron loss and gain in orthologous genes in multiple species, we first aligned the Nematostella
gene set to the set of human ENSEMBL models (release 26.35.1) and to the TIGR release 5 of
Arabidopsis thaliana genes. In 2,347 cases, a human gene was found to have a mutual best hit to both
a Nematostella and an Arabidopsis gene, forming a tentative cluster of orthologous genes to be studied
further.
Gene models are often incomplete in the 5’ ends and may have have poorly determined splice sites, so
we restrict our analysis to regions of highly conserved peptides in the orthologs of all three species. The
independent identification of such regions in multiple species provides strong evidence for the accuracy
of the gene models in these regions. Hence, we performed multiple alignments of the orthologous
clusters and identified gap-free blocks flanked by fully conserved amino acids. We then identified
annotated splice sites of all species within these regions, which the additional requirements that 1)
none of the peptides must have a gap in the alignment closer than 3 AA from the splice site and 2) no
two different peptides must have splice sites at different positions closer than 4 AA. Empirically, these
requirements are necessary to avoid spurious detection of “intron losses” due to ambiguities in either
the multiple alignment or the gene model’s splice sites. While some of these cases may reflect real
sliding of donor or acceptor sites, we restrict ourselves to studying gains and losses of introns here.
Finally, we required that at least 5 amino acids out of 10 in the flanking regions of the splice sites be
either fully conserved or have strong functional similarity among all four species.
9,947 highly reliable intron splice sites were identified by these requirements. The results are
summarized as a Venn diagram in figure S6.1, indicating the number of shared introns between the
species.
Remarkably, about 81% of the human introns (4,403 of 5,435) are shared with nematostella. Assuming
that intron losses have occurred independently in the human and nematostella lineages, and that the
probability of independent intron insertion events at the same location is negligible we estimate the loss
in Nematostella since the last common ancestor (LCA) with human as 158 / (158 + 1258) = 11%. In a
similar fashion, we estimate a loss of almost 22% along the human lineage, twice the amount of introns

----- Page 58 (native) -----
lost in the Nematostella lineage.
The above results also allow us to place upper limits on intron gains within the human and Nematostella
lineages:  28.6% of all introns shared by human and Nematostella (and hence present in their LCA) are
also shared by Arabidopsis. If additional introns have been independently gained in each lineage we
expect a lower fraction of the total introns in each species to be shared with arabidopsis. In fact, we
find 26.5% of all Nematostella introns and 26.1% of all human introns are shared with Arabidopsis,
which translate into maximum intron gains of ~9% in human and ~7% in Nematostella. These results
are strict upper limits, since the lower conservation with Arabidopsis can also be explained if the loss
rate vary inherently between introns. In this case we will expect introns that are shared between
human and Nematostella to be less prone to loss, and hence a larger fraction will also have survived in
Arabidopsis. This scenario is very conceivable since some introns have been shown to contain
regulatory elements and the loss of such introns would presumably be selected against.     
To the extent that the introns in highly conserved peptide regions studied here are representative of
introns in general, the above analysis suggests that the Nematostella genome has only lost 11% of its
introns since the LCA with human, and gained at most 7%.
We next identified 2,347 clusters of orthologous genes in all bilaterian orthologous clusters with an
unambiguous  1:1:1 member relationship in human, Drosophila melanogaster (fly), and C. elegans. In
1,523 of these clusters, the human gene had a mutual best hit to a Nematostella gene, forming clusters
of four orthologous genes. 4,951 highly reliable introns were identified by these requirements. The
results are summarized in Table S6.1.  Nematostella has the most introns at these conserved positions,
followed by human with a relative intron frequency of about 0.91, whereas nematode and in particular
fly have considerably fewer introns (0.37 and 0.21). From these numbers we estimate the intron losses
in fly, nematode, and human since their LCA to be 82% , 77%, and 12% respectively. Note that the
nematode, although having retained only ~23% of the introns since the LCA with human have ~37% of
the number of human introns. This suggests a considerable gain of introns in the nematodes, as also
reported by [Logsdon 2004].
This analysis of aligning conserved sequences to identify conservation of introns was further extended
to include seven species - Nematostella vectensis, Homo sapiens, Ciona intestinalis, Drosophila
melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Crytococcus neoformans and Arabodopsis thaliana.  4342
introns from the seven genomes at 2645 aligned positions which contain an intron in at least one of the
seven orthologs.
Methods for Intron Gain/Loss tree
Starting from the binary character matrix compiled as described above of 2,645 intron positions across
7 taxa, we found the most parsimonious solution to the intron gain/loss problem by projecting these
characters onto the (known) topology.  Weighted parsimony as implemented in PAUP 4.0b10(40) was
used, with the cost of an intron gain significantly greater (more than 10X) the cost of an intron loss. 
The parsimony assignment of characters to internal nodes is independent of this gain/loss weight ratio. 
From the branch lengths produced by PAUP, and the known weights, we solved for the number of losses
and gains along each branch as show in the main text figure.
Supplement S7
Local conservation of gene order
To search the human and Nematostella genomes for regions of conserved linkage, we performed the
following analysis. First, the genes on each genome were assigned unique identifers according to the

----- Page 59 (native) -----
order in which they occur on the chromosomes or scaffolds. We then used the sequence alignments
described in the clustering section to scan each genome for tandem expanded gene families, defined
here as clusters of genes with a maximum of 4 intervening genes, showing similarity at e-values <
1x10-10. All but one member, the longest peptide, were excluded from further analysis at each such
region in the genomes.
From the human vs nematostella protein alignments we next excluded all genes with more than 15 hits
with e-value < 1x10-10 from consideration. Finally, of the remaining pair-wise hits we included only
hits with a score of more than 70% of the value of the highest score of either of the two genes to any
of the genes in the opposite genome. This approach enriches the set for orthologous gene pairs while
removing weak super-family similarities from the analysis.  At this stage we were left with 11,351 pair-
wise hits, involving 6,986 nematostella genes and 8,426 human genes. We then recalculated the gene
order IDs in the two genomes, featuring only the genes involved in these high-quality alignments, and
scanned for regions of conserved synteny or linkage in the following manner:
For the first pair-wise alignment of genes in the proteomes of the two species, the gene locations on the
chromosomes were recorded and a one-pair segment of conserved synteny was defined. Subsequent
gene pairs either defines new segments, or, if the genes in both species are located within a specified
maximum distance, Nmax from a gene pair in an existing segment, the pair is added to that segment.
If a pair can be added to two segments, these segments are joined into a larger segment of conserved
synteny. Note that this method does not require strict conservation of gene order: inversions on scales
smaller than Nmax are tolerated.After traversing all alignments, we have a set of conserved regions, on
which we can impose a minimum member limit (typical 3 pairs) to remove potentially spurious regions.
For human-Nematostella, we found no strict significant conservation of gene order, but by choosing a
large value of Nmax we nonetheless detect regions of conserved linkage in which the local gene order
has been scrambled. In order to detect the significance of these regions, we randomly scrambled the
order of the genes on each chromosome or scaffold and applied, for the same sequence alignment data,
the algorithm to the scrambled data set. This allows us to choose parameters to minimize false positive
detection. Note the importance of the filtering out weak hits in this method, as the presence of such hits
would significantly increase the false positive rate in the detection of segments of conserved linkage.
Using Nmax = 40 and considering only segments of 9 or more participating genes, we find 33 such
segments of conserved synteny between human and Nematostella, with none expected by chance, as
seen by running the algorithm on the scrambled set.
Identification of human genome segments free of recent chromosomal fusions and large-
scale rearrangements
To facilitate the search for large-scale conservation of gene linkage in the presence of extensive
changes in local gene order between humans and Nematostella, we identified 98 segments of the
human genome which appear to be uninterrupted by inter-chromosomal translocations or fusions when
compared to the genomes of other chordates.  To identify likely locations of chromosomal fusions along
the human genome which separate such segments, we followed the following procedure:
1.  Putatively orthologous gene pairs were identified between the ENSEMBL human gene set and the
chordate Branchiostoma floridae draft gene set [JGI web page] using the mutual best BLAST hit
criterion. 
2.  Scaffolds of the B. floridae assembly were clustered as described below for Nematostella, based on
the similarity of the distribution in the human genome of human genes orthologous the genes on the
scaffold. 
3.  A representation of each human chromosome arm was constructed in which each gene along the
chromosome was represented by the identifying number of the cluster of scaffolds in which its B.
floridae ortholog resides.
4.  A Hidden Markov Model, constructed and implemented in software for the purpose, was used to
segment the human chromosomes into segments with an approximately uniform distribution of hits to a
specific subset of the scaffold clusters.

Figure S7.2 illustrates the results of this procedure for human chromosome arms 14q, 15q, 16p and
16q, and Table S7.1 lists the extent of the 98 identified segments in base pair coordinates on the NCBI
Human genome build 36.
Construction and Significance Testing of Putative Ancestral Linkage groups (PALs)
To test for conservation of large-scale synteny in the presence of extensive local rearrangement of gene
order, we compared 147 of the  largest scaffolds of the Nematostella assembly to the segments of the
98 human genome described above.  The examined scaffolds were selected because, like the 98 human
segments, each contains descendants of 40 or more ancestral eumetazoan genes.  For each scaffold-
segment pair, we tabulated the number of ancestral gene clusters giving rise to descendants on both
members of the pair.  This number counts the number of independent orthologs shared by the scaffold
and the segment.  For each scaffold-segment pair, the number of observed orthologs was compared to
a null model in which scaffolds and segments comprise genes descending from genes drawn
independently from the set of 7,766 ancestral genes. This method of counting orthologs, and this null
model control naturally for independent tandem gene duplicates which could otherwise artifactually
inflate the number of observed orthologs in circumstances where there is no remnant of conserved
synteny, because tandem duplicates arising independently should be contained in a single reconstructed
ancestral gene cluster.    The expected number of orthologs under this model is governed by the
hypergeometric distribution, allowing us to compute a p-value for consistency for each scaffold-segment
comparison with the null model.  Since we compared 147 scaffolds with 98 segments, we applied a
Bonferroni correction factor of 1/14406.  The complete set of these numbers of shared orthologous
genes are shown in figure S7.3, for all scaffolds (67/147) and segments (40/98) which participated in a
statistically significant shared synteny relationship.  Table cell backgrounds are colored yellow when p <
0.01/14406, and pink when p < 0.05 / 14406.  A blue background indicates p<0.5/14406.
Table S7.3 has 112 yellow cells, corresponding to 112 cases of statistically significant conservation of
synteny between a Nematostella scaffold and a segment of the human genome.  The rows and columns
of this table have been ordered to reveal 13 sets of scaffolds and chromosome segments, defined by
the criterion that none can be subdivided without separating into different sets a scaffold-segment pair
with significant evidence (p<0.01) for conserved synteny.   We interpret these collections of modern
sequences to be descended from the same chromosomes, or chromosomal segments of the common
ancestor of eumetazoa, and refer to them therefore as putative ancestral linkage groups, or PALs.
Table S7.X lists the 255 ancestral gene clusters linked with the HOX clusters in PAL-A.
A clustering method allows more extensive reconstruction of putative ancestral linkage
groups.
Having demonstrated that there is extensive conservation of linkage relationships among genes using
the conservative statistical criteria described above, we developed a more sensitive method to
reconstruct ancestral linkage groups based on clustering scaffolds or chromosome segments.  In this
method, a matrix of ortholog counts similar to that shown in figure S7.3 is constructed.  The rows and
columns of this table are then clustered hierarchically, using Pearson correlation as a measure of
similarity and the average pairwise linkage method with the "cluster" program(41).  Figure S7.4 shows
the result as a "dot plot" as in figure S7.2.  Horizontal and vertical lines divide clusters of scaffolds
(vertical lines) and human chromosome segments (horizontal lines), defined by a cut of the hierarchical
tree at a correlation coefficient of 0.2.  This clustering of scaffolds and chromosome segments defines
15 large PALs, each with descendants of more than one hundred ancestral eumetazoan genes.  3055
ancestral genes, or 40% of the ancestral genes are assigned to one of these PALs.
Supplement S8:  Eumetazoan Ancestry of Genes

----- Page 61 (native) -----
Construction of "Centroid" sequences.
We define the "centroid" of a cluster of orthologous amino acid sequences to be a synthetic amino acid
sequence which maximizes the sum of BLAST alignment scores between the centroid and the members
of the cluster.  This provides a surrogate for the peptide sequence that is ancestral to each cluster.
Classification of eumetazoan genes by ancestry
Centroids (see above) of the ancestral eumetazoan gene clusters were aligned to non-animal entries in
SwissProt/TREMBL[Uniprot release 8 from http://www.uniprot.org] with BLAST(11), using the NCBI
database to remove metazoan entries.  The Pfam(30) annotation of SwissProt/TREMBL from swisspfam
[Version of Sept. 6 2006.  Current version available from http://pfam.janelia.org] was parsed to
identify Pfam domains found only in animals, as well as pairs of Pfam domains that occur separately in
non-aminals but only were found together in animals. 
Clusters whose centroid had a BLAST hit to out-group proteins of e-value <1e-6, and also clusters
containing a member which is a mutual best hit to an Arabidopsis, Dictyostelium or Saccharomyces
were annotated as "ancient," unless one of the following conditions was met:
1) if both the Nematostella peptide and at least one other animal protein had an "animal specific" Pfam
domain, the cluster was designated a type II novelty.
2) if both the Nematostella peptide and at least one other animal protein had an "animal specific" Pfam
domain combination, the cluster was designated a type III novelty.
Note that type III (animal-specific eukaryotic domain combinations) are based only on pairwise
combinations.  Thus animal proteins that shuffle the order of domains found within an ancient
eukaryotic family are not designated as novel in this analysis.
Functional annotation of ancestral gene clusters
Panther(42, 43) family annotations on the sequences of extant species were transferred to the inferred
ancestral clusters when both Nematostella and bilaterian members of the clusters shared the same
Panther annotation.  These annotations were mapped to various overlapping functional categories using
the Panther Pathways(43) and Panther Ontology databases. 
To asses whether specific functional categories were over- or underrepresented among the different
types of novelties, we adapted the GOstat approach of Beissbarth and Speed (44) for use with the
Panther ontologies, and computed p-values for enrichment and dearth relative the hypergeometric
distribution.  For both Panther Pathways and Pather Ontology, we limited our tests to the 100 ontology
terms which had the greatest number of inferred ancestral genes assigned to them, and applied a
Bonferroni correction for 100 tests, even though this is somewhat conservative, since the categories
have significant overlap.  Table S8.1 lists the functional categories enriched for novel genes of the three
types.

Table S2.1  Summary of WGS libraries
Shotgun libraries are identified by their four-letter name, which is used as a prefix to the identifier of all
reads from the library.  For each library, the table lists: the mean size of genomic DNA inserts in base
pairs; the number of sequencing reads attempted for each library; the number of reads with at least
100 bp of high-quality sequence after removal of vector and low-quality sequence, as described
previously[Dehal 2002]; the number of reads which have a detected alignment to other reads in the
shotgun data set (see discussion above); the number of reads which are placed in the contigs of the
assembly; and the mean read length, after trimming.  Column totals are shown in bold for selected
columns, and the fraction of reads lost to trimming, lack of alignment, and lack of placement in the
assembly is shown as a percentage of the previous total. 
Figure S2.1:  Observed density of polymorphic sites
The rate of single nucleotide polymorphism observed in the assembled genome sequence is 0.8%. 
Figure S2.2 shows the observed (orange) and Poisson ascertainment bias-corrected (green) frequency
of polymorphic positions as a function of local depth of assembly for a sampling of 14.4 million positions
in the assembly [Left hand scale].  Positions are considered polymorphic if two or more WGS reads
indicate each of two or more different bases at a given position.  The red curve shows the number of
positions considered for each depth of coverage, and the dotted curve shows poisson distributed counts
with the same mean.

Figure S7.1:  Synteny block search
The size distribution of synteny blocks for human vs. Nematostella (blue bars) is compared to that for a
synthetic data set in which gene positions have been artificially randomized (maroon bars), where
synteny blocks are defined as maximal collections of ortholog pairs where pairs of adjacent orthologous
pairs have no more than 40 non-participating genes intervening between them. 
Figure S7.2: HMM segmentation example
Each graph plots the rank order of human genes along four human chromosome arms (horizontal
coordinate) versus the rank position of the B. floridae mutual-best-hit ortholog within five clusters of B.
floridae scaffolds.  Vertical red lines indicate the boundaries between human chromosome arms, and
horizontal red lines indicate boundaries between scaffold clusters.  Discontinuities in the distribution of
orthologous gene positions within chromosome arms identified by a hidden markov model are indicated
by the addition of vertical black lines on the right.  These discontinuities are most easily explained by
chromosomal fusions or large-scale re-arrangements in the human lineage which are recent compared
to the time scale of gene order evolution.

Figure S7.3:  Clustering method for constructing putative ancestral linkage groups (PALs)
Blue dots mark the position in human chromosome segments (vertical coordinate) and the Nematostella
scaffolds (horizontal coordinate) of a pair of orthologous genes.  Nematostella scaffolds and human
chromosome segments have been ordered by a hierarchical clustering procedure, and concatenated
together.  Gene positions are in rank order rather than base pair coordinate, where only genes
descended from the set of 7,766 ancestral gene clusters have been numbered.  Descendants of
ancestral eumetazoan clusters with more than 25 genes from the six representative animal genomes
were excluded from the analysis.  Horizontal and vertical lines divide clusters of human chromosome
segments and Nematostella scaffolds defined by having an average pairwise correlation coefficient of
their distribution of hits to the other genome greater than 0.2.  The trees along the left and top of the
plot are graphical representations of the average pairwise correlation scores among the hierarchically
clustered human segments (left) and Nematostella scaffolds (top).  Terminal branches are centered

Chromosome 12.  Horizontal tick marks indicate positions of human genes descended from the set of
7,766 inferred ancestral genes.  Genes with an ortholog in Nematostella on scaffolds 26, 61, 53, 46, 3
and 5 are labeled and connected by a colored line to the position of the Nematostella ortholog (See Fig
4c), except where the gene falls into an ancestral metazoan cluster for more than 25 genes from
human, frog, fish, fly, nematode and Nematostella (Section S4).  These large genes families are more
likely to have members showing spurious conserved synteny, since they may have members in many
regions of the genome.  The genes of the HOX C cluster fall into such a large family, but have been
labeled to show the position of the HOX cluster.
