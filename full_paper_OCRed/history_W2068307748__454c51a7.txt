monophyletic gene family related to animal
receptor kinases

Plant receptor-like kinases (RLKs) are proteins with a predicted
signal sequence, single transmembrane region, and cytoplasmic
kinase domain. Receptor-like kinases belong to a large gene family
with at least 610 members that represent nearly 2.5% of Arabi-
dopsis protein coding genes. We have categorized members of this
family into subfamilies based on both the identity of the extracel-
lular domains and the phylogenetic relationships between the
kinase domains of subfamily members. Surprisingly, this structur-
ally deﬁned group of genes is monophyletic with respect to kinase
domains when compared with the other eukaryotic kinase families.
In an extended analysis, animal receptor kinases, Raf kinases, plant
RLKs, and animal receptor tyrosine kinases form a well supported
group sharing a common origin within the superfamily of seriney
threonineytyrosine kinases. Among animal kinase sequences, Dro-
sophila Pelle and related cytoplasmic kinases fall within the plant
RLK clade, which we now deﬁne as the RLKyPelle family. A survey
of expressed sequence tag records for land plants reveals that
mosses, ferns, conifers, and ﬂowering plants have similar percent-
ages of expressed sequence tags representing RLKyPelle ho-
mologs, suggesting that the size of this gene family may have been
close to the present-day level before the diversiﬁcation of land
plant lineages. The distribution pattern of four RLK subfamilies on
Arabidopsis chromosomes indicates that the expansion of this
gene family is partly a consequence of duplication and reshufﬂing
of the Arabidopsis genome and of the generation of tandem
repeats.
T
he ability to perceive and process information from chemical
signals via cell surface receptors is a basic property of all
living systems. In animals, the family of receptor tyrosine kinases
(RTKs) mediates many signaling events at the cell surface (1, 2).
This class of receptors is defined structurally by the presence of
a ligand-binding extracellular domain, a single membrane-
spanning domain, and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. In
plants, receptor-like kinases (RLKs) are a class of transmem-
brane kinases similar in basic structure to the RTKs (3). In
Arabidopsis alone, it has been reported that there are more than
300 RLKs (4, 5). In the limited cases where a functional role has
been identified for plant RLKs, they have been implicated in a
diverse range of signaling processes, such as brassinosteroid
signaling via BRI1 (6), meristem development controlled by
CLV1 (7), perception of flagellin by FLS2 (8), control of leaf
development by Crinkly4 (9), regulation of abscission by
HAESA (10), self-incompatibility controlled by SRKs (11), and
bacterial resistance mediated by Xa21 (12). Putative ligands for
SRK (13, 14), CLV1 (15, 16), BRI1 (17), and FLS2 (18) have
recently been identified. Proteins interacting with the kinase
domains of RLKs in vitro have also been found (19–21).
Plant RLKs can be distinguished from animal RTKs by the
finding that all RLKs examined to date show serineythreonine
kinase specificity, whereas animal receptor kinases, with the ex-
ception of transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b) receptors, are
tyrosine kinases. In addition, the extracellular domains of RLKs are
distinct from most ligand-binding domains of RTKs identified so far
(1, 2). These differences raise the question of the specific evolu-
tionary relationship between the RTKs and RLKs within the
recognized superfamily of related eukaryotic serineythreoniney
tyrosine protein kinases (ePKs). An earlier phylogenetic analysis
(22), using the six RLK sequences available at the time, indicated
a close relationship between plant sequences and animal RTKs,
although RLKs were placed in the ‘‘other kinase’’ category. A more
recent analysis using only plant sequences led to the conclusion that
the 18 RLKs sampled seemed to form a separate family among the
various eukaryotic kinases (23). The recent completion of the
Arabidopsis genome sequence (5) provides an opportunity for a
more comprehensive analysis of the relationships between these
classes of receptor kinases.
To understand the evolution of the RLK family and its
relationship with other kinase families and provide a framework
to facilitate the prediction of RLK function, we set out to
conduct a genome-wide survey of RLK-related sequences in
Arabidopsis. Through a phylogenetic analysis of the conserved
kinase domains, we sought to determine (i) whether RLKs
belong to a monophyletic group when compared with other ePKs
and (ii) how the RLKs are related to animal receptor kinases. To
investigate the relationship between the evolution of land plants
and the expansion of the RLK family, we performed a survey of
expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for a variety of organisms.
Finally, we looked into the chromosomal distribution of four
RLK subfamilies to investigate the potential mechanisms con-
tributing to the expansion of this gene family in Arabidopsis.
Materials and Methods
Sequence Selection. RLKs. All published plant RLK sequences were
retrieved, and their kinase domain sequences were used to conduct
batch BLAST analysis (24) for related sequences in Viridiplantae,
with an E value cutoff of 1 3 10210. The cutoff was chosen based
on multiple phylogenetic analyses using data sets generated from
cutoff E values of 1 3 10220, 1 3 10210, and 1. All known RLKs
were recovered at 1 3 10220; therefore, a more relaxed criterion,
1 3 10210, was used to retrieve all potentially related genes. The
search results were merged, and redundant sequences were deleted.
As of February 2001, more than 900 nonredundant candidates of
plant RLKs or related kinases were present in GenBank, and they
were used for subsequent phylogenetic analysis. For a complete list

Representatives of the eukaryotic protein kinase (ePK) superfam-
ily. Based on Hanks and Hunter (22), plant and animal sequences
from each ePK family were chosen. Plant kinases that seemed to be
unique to plants were also included in this study (23). Their
accession numbers are as follows. Arabidopsis sequences: CDC2a
(AAB23643), CPK7 (AAB03247), CKI1 (CAA55395), CKA1

cAPK (P17612), Raf1 (TVHUF6), c-SRC (P12931), TLK1
(NP036422), and TTK (A42861).
Animal receptor kinases. One representative human receptor
tyrosine kinase sequence was selected from each RTK subfamily
(1, 2) as follows: AXL (NP001690), DDR (Q08345), EGFR
(P00533), EPH (P21709), FGFR2 (P21802), HGFR (P08581),
IR (NP000199), KLG-like PTK7 (AAC50484), LTK (P29376),
MuSK (AAB63044), PDGFRb (PFHUGB), RET (S05582),
RYK (I37560), TIE (P35590), TRKa (BAA34355), and VEGFR
(P17948). Human TGF-b receptors (TGFbR I, P36897; TGFbR
II, P37173) were chosen as animal representatives of receptor
serineythreonine kinases.
Sequence Annotation, Alignment, and Phylogenetic Analysis. Delin-
eation of structural domains. Structural domains of all sequences
were annotated according to SMART (25) and Pfam (26)
databases. The receptor-like kinase configuration was deter-
mined by the presence of putative signal sequences and extra-
cellular domains. Sequences without signal sequences, trans-
membrane regions, or putative extracellular domains were also
included in the analysis. The kinase domain sequences delin-
eated initially according to sequence prediction databases were
modified to include missing or exclude excessive flanking se-
quences according to the subdomain signature of eukaryotic
kinases (22).
Alignment of sequences. The sizes of the kinase domains range
from 250 to 300 aa. These sequences were compiled and aligned
by using CLUSTALX (27). The weighing matrices used were
BLOSUM62 or PAM250 with the penalty of gap opening 10 and
gap extension 0.2. The alignments generated by these two scoring
tables are similar to each other and were manually adjusted
according to the subdomain signatures of eukaryotic kinases
(22). The alignment for all 610 RLK family members is provided
as supporting information.
Optimality criterion and PAUP program parameters. The aligned
sequences were analyzed with PAUP (29) based on the Neighbor–
Joining method (28), minimal evolution, and maximum parsi-
mony criteria. To obtain the optimal trees, bootstrap analyses
were conducted with 100 replicates using the heuristic search
option. Two character-weighing schemes used were (i) all char-
acters of equal weight and (ii) consider the number of nucleotide
changes required to change from one amino acid to the other. All
other parameters for PAUP were the default values. Because of
the difficulty in aligning kinase subdomain X, two character sets
were defined with or without kinase subdomain X sequences.
Tree rooting and display. Aminoglycoside kinase (APH(39)III)
from Staphylococcus (P00554) (30) and the Arabidopsis homolog
of RIO1 family kinases (S61006) (31) were used as outgroups in
this study. In all analyses, the rooting based on either sequence
gave the same results. The numbers associated with each branch
represent the bootstrap support, and branches with less than
50% support are collapsed.
Identification of Sequences Representing RLK Homologs. Genomic
sequences. The kinase domain protein sequences of CLV1 and
NAK were used to conduct BLAST searches against the genome
sequences of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans,
Drosophila melanogaster, and human. The genomic sequence hits
with an E value smaller than 1 3 10210 were included for further
analysis. Phylogenetic trees were constructed with the candidate
sequences and the eukaryotic protein kinase representatives.
Sequences that fell into the same clade as RLKs and had more
than 50% bootstrap support were regarded as RLK homologs.
The sequences shown in this analysis are Caenorhabditis Pelle-
like sequence (CePelle, T23534), Drosophila Pelle (DmPelle,
Q05652), and human IRAK1 (NP001560).
EST sequences. CLV1 and DmPelle kinase domain sequences
were used to conduct BLAST searches against the EST records of
organisms listed in Table 1. All EST sequences with E values
smaller than 1.0 were retrieved for further analysis. The se-
quences with E values smaller than 1 3 10250 were regarded as
RLK homologs. The rest of the sequences longer than 300
nucleotides were submitted for batch BLASTX searches against
Arabidopsis polypeptide records in GenBank. These sequences
were regarded as RLK homologs if the top five matches of the
BLAST outputs were RLK family kinases.
Results
The Diversity of RLKs in the Arabidopsis Genome. As the Arabidopsis
genome sequencing effort approached completion, we con-
ducted a genome-wide survey of the RLK gene family to gain
more understanding of its size and complexity. The kinase
domains of 22 different plant RLKs with various extracellular
domains were used to search for similar sequences in GenBank
polypeptide records of Viridiplantae, including all land plants

and algae. With the cutoff E value of 1 3 10210, more than 900
nonredundant sequences were retrieved. The most recent survey
of the completed Arabidopsis genome revealed 620 sequences
related to RLKs. Ten of these sequences showed greatest
sequence similarity to the Raf kinase family. For the remaining
610 Arabidopsis sequences, 193 did not have an obvious receptor
configuration as determined by the absence of putative signal
sequences andyor transmembrane regions (see supporting in-
formation). The other 417 genes with receptor configurations
can be classified into more than 21 structural classes by their
extracellular domains with examples shown in Fig. 1. The sizes
of these classes varied greatly. The leucine-rich repeat (LRR)
containing RLKs represented the largest group in Arabidopsis
with 216 genes.
To determine whether RLKs with similar extracellular do-
mains also have similar kinase domains, the polypeptide se-
quences of the kinase domains of all 620 Arabidopsis genes were
aligned, and a phylogenetic tree was generated with the Neigh-
bor–Joining method (28) using APH(39)III as outgroup (see
supporting
information
for
the
complete
alignment).
APH(39)III is a bacterial gene that is thought to be a distant
relative of ePK (30). The phylogeny of Arabidopsis kinase
domain sequences revealed an interesting pattern where the
sequences clearly fell into distinct clades (see supporting infor-
mation for the phylogenetic tree). We have tentatively assigned
these natural groups into 44 different RLK subfamilies based on
the kinase domain phylogeny (see supporting information for the
subfamily assignment). A noteworthy feature of the pattern
obtained is that the members within each of the RLK subfamilies
tend to have similar extracellular domains, indicating that a
single domain-shuffling event may have led to the founding of
each of the various RLK subfamilies. For example, the diverse
LRR-containing RLKs fell into more than 13 subfamilies based
on kinase-domain phylogeny. With few exceptions, the pattern
obtained is consistent with the grouping based on the structural
arrangement of LRRs and the organization of introns in the
extracellular domains of the individual RLKs (data not shown).
Phylogenetic trees were also generated using minimum evolution
and maximum parsimony criterions. The results were similar to
phylogeny generated with the Neighbor–Joining method (data
not shown).
The Relationship Between RLKs and Other Families of Protein Kinases
from Arabidopsis. Despite the similar domain organization be-
tween different plant RLKs, the phylogenetic relationships
among members of this family have not been thoroughly studied.
Members of the RLK family could have arisen independently
multiple times from distinct families of ePKs. Alternatively, they
could have originated from a single ePK family and have a
monophyletic origin. To address this question, we conducted a
phylogenetic analysis by using the kinase domain amino acid
sequences of representative RLK sequences from each RLK
subfamily and representatives from different ePK families found
in Arabidopsis.
In the phylogeny based on minimal evolution criterion, all
RLK representative sequences from Arabidopsis formed a well
supported clade, indicating that RLKs have a monophyletic
origin within the superfamily of plant kinases (Fig. 2). In addition
to RLK sequences, this monophyletic group also included ki-
nases with no apparent signal sequence or transmembrane
domain, and they were collectively named receptor-like cyto-
plasmic kinases (RLCKs, Fig. 1). Some of these kinases formed
subfamilies distinct from other RLKs, whereas others were
embedded within several different RLK subfamilies. To deter-
mine whether the monophyletic grouping of the RLK family
represented a bias because of the exclusive use of Arabidopsis
sequences, an extended analysis was conducted using RLK
sequences from plants other than Arabidopsis. The sequences
analyzed all fell into the same clade as Arabidopsis RLKs (data
not shown).
Among the ePK families found in Arabidopsis, Raf kinases
were paraphyletic to the RLK family and, together with RLKs,
formed a well supported group with a bootstrap value of 98%
(Fig. 2). Based on the parsimony criterion, the support for the
RLK family and Raf kinases as a monophyletic group was still
high at 86% (data not shown). Taken together, these results
indicated that Raf kinases are the closest relatives to RLKs
among the Arabidopsis sequences analyzed.
The Relationships Between Animal Receptor Kinases and Plant RLKs.
Animal RTKs and receptor serineythreonine kinases (RSKs) are
other families of ePKs with a domain organization similar to that
of the plant RLKs. To determine the relationships among these
receptor kinase families, we analyzed the phylogenetic relation-
ships between the kinase domain sequences of representative
Arabidopsis RLKs and animal receptor kinases. Arabidopsis and
human representatives of other ePK families were also included.

The phylogenetic tree generated based on minimal evolution
criterion is shown in Fig. 3. All 16 RTK subfamily representatives
and c-SRC formed a well supported group, indicating a mono-
phyletic origin for tyrosine receptor kinases. The sister groups to
the RTK family were Raf kinases. Plant RLKs included in this
analysis formed another monophyletic group, indicating that
RLKs have a distinct origin from that of Raf kinases and animal
RTKs. Plant RLKs, Raf kinases, RSKs, and RTKs collectively
formed a well supported group with a bootstrap support of 84%.
The monophyly of kinases in this group when compared with the
other ePK families was also supported by analyses based on
maximum parsimony (data not shown). However, the specific
relationships between animal RSKs, RTKs, Raf kinases, and
plant RLKs were less conclusive because different optimality
criteria gave inconsistent results. To investigate whether the
results obtained were biased by using only human sequences, we
conducted an extended analysis including RTK and RSK se-
quences from Caenorhabditis, Drosophila, sponge, and hydra,
and we reached the same conclusion (data not shown). Based on
these analyses, we defined the monophyletic group that contains
the RLK, RTK, RSK, and Raf kinase genes as the receptor
kinase group.
Homologs of Plant RLKs in Eukaryotes. To determine whether
members of the RLK family are present in organisms other than
flowering plants, we first used the kinase domain sequence of
CLV1 to search for homologous sequences in the genomes of
yeast, C. elegans, D. melanogaster, and human. No RLK homolog
was found in the yeast genome. Five animal homologs of the
RLK family were found: the Pelle kinase (DmPelle) in Drosoph-
ila (40), the Pelle-like kinase (CePelle) in Caenorhabditis
(T23534), and three IRAKs in human (32). DmPelle, CePelle,
and IRAK1 are all cytoplasmic kinases and all fell into the same
clade as plant RLKs with strong bootstrap support (Fig. 3,
shaded area). A similar search using other RLK kinase se-
quences yielded the same results (data not shown). Based on this
Fig. 2.
Arabidopsis receptor-like kinases and related kinases form a mono-
phyletic group distinct from all of the other eukaryotic protein kinases found
in the Arabidopsis genome. The tree was generated with the kinase domain
sequences of representative Arabidopsis ePKs and RLKs using APH(39)III as
outgroup based on minimal evolution. The bootstrap values are shown at the
nodes. The boxed region represents the receptor-like kinase family. The
arrowhead indicates the RLK subfamily. The abbreviations used are according
to Fig. 1.
Fig. 3.
Human receptor kinases and Arabidopsis receptor kinases belong to
distinct but related families, and Pelle kinases are the animal homologs of
Arabidopsis RLKs. (A) Plant and animal representatives of ePKs were used in
this analysis. The tree is rooted with APH(39)III based on minimal evolution. It
indicates that Raf, RSK, RTK, and RLK form a well supported group distinct
from all other ePKs (boxed region). The bootstrap values are shown at the
nodes. Animal Pelle kinases (shaded area) are found in the same clade as RLKs.
(B) The proposed evolutionary relationships between receptor kinase family
members are as follows: 1, an ancient duplication event leading to the
divergence of RLKyPelle from RTKyRaf; 2, a more recent gene duplication
leading to the divergence of RTK from Raf; and 3, the divergence of plant and
animal lineages, resulting in the ancestral sequences that gave rise to the
extant receptors and related kinases.

analysis, we defined the clade containing the plant RLKs and
Pelle-like sequences as the RLKyPelle family.
To broaden the scope of the searches, we used the amino acid
sequences of CLV1 and Pelle kinase domains to search the EST
database for RLK homologs in 20 different eukaryotes (15
shown in Table 1). Sequences with an E value of less than 1 3
10250, a conservative criterion, were regarded as RLK homologs
without further examination. The remaining sequences were
subjected to BLAST searches and were treated as RLK homologs
if the top five matches were known RLKs or RLK homologs. The
results of EST searches are shown in Table 1. All seven of the
flowering plants, including four dicots and three monocots, have
0.18% to 0.6% of their ESTs representing RLKyPelle family
members. Pines, ferns, and mosses all have a percent EST
representation similar to that of flowering plants. With the
exception of the three ESTs representing Drosophila Pelle
kinase, no other organism examined produced ESTs, which
could be classified as RLKyPelle family members.
The Distribution of RLKs on Arabidopsis Chromosomes. The size
discrepancy of the RLKyPelle family between plants and ani-
mals raises the question on how the expansion of this family
occurred in the plant lineages. To address this question, we
examined the location of RLKs on the Arabidopsis chromo-
somes. After comparing the location of genes to the phylogeny
based on kinase domains, we found that subfamilies differed in
their chromosomal distributions. At one extreme, 35 of the 40
members of the DUF26 subfamily were located on chromosome
4 (Fig. 4A). At the other extreme, 51 genes representing LRR X,
XI, and XIII subfamilies were distributed among all five chro-
mosomes (Fig. 4B). In addition, we found that more than 30%
of the RLKyPelle family members in Arabidopsis are in tandem
repeats with 2 to 19 genes. A closer look at the location of the
38 DUF26 subfamily members on chromosome 4 (including
three potential pseudogenes) indicates that 34 of them are in
tandem repeats (Fig. 4C). The phylogenetic relationships be-
tween DUF26 genes in the tandem repeats indicates that at least
one intrachromosomal duplication event occurred in the region
containing tandem repeats. Taken together, the results suggest
that tandem duplication events and large-scale duplications of
chromosomes are two of the potential mechanisms responsible
for the expansion of the RLKyPelle family in Arabidopsis.
Discussion
Evolutionary History of the Receptor Kinase Group. Plant RLKs were
originally grouped into a single family based on their configu-
ration as transmembrane kinases with serine and threonine
specificity. Our analysis provides a phylogenetic basis for the
classification of RLKs as a single family in the eukaryotic protein
kinase superfamily. Interestingly, 24% of the 610 Arabidopsis
genes in the RLKyPelle family analyzed do not have an extra-
cellular domain based on the absence of signal sequences and
transmembrane regions. Some of these apparently cytoplasmic
kinases form unique subfamilies, whereas others are most closely
related to kinases with a receptor topology. The latter may
represent ancestral forms that were recruited into the receptor
kinase configuration by domain fusion events. Alternatively,
some of the soluble kinase forms could be derived from ancestral
receptor kinase forms. In any case, it is apparent that kinase
domains from the RLKyPelle family were recruited multiple
times by fusion with different extracellular domains to form the
subfamilies found in Arabidopsis. This notion can be expanded to
include the animal RTK and RSK families in the receptor kinase
group, which appear to have been formed by recruitment of
kinases from the same lineage, distinct from all other ePK
families.
Based on the kinase domain phylogeny, a hypothetical se-
quence of events that occurred in the evolution of the receptor
kinase group is proposed in Fig. 3B. According to this model, an
early gene duplication event led to the founding of two lineages
that diversified into the RTK and Raf families on one hand and
the RLKyPelle family on the other. This diversification seems to
have occurred before the divergence of plants and animals. In
addition, both lineages contain representatives of soluble kinase
and transmembrane receptor forms. It should be noted that the
soluble Pelle-like and Raf kinases form complexes with cell
surface receptors and are responsible for transduction of signals
to downstream effectors (33, 34). Perhaps the continual recruit-
ment of this particular lineage of kinase modules was favored
during evolution because ancestral forms had already specialized
in mediating signaling from transmembrane receptors. Exami-
nation of kinases belonging to the receptor kinase group in more
primitive eukaryotes may be informative. Whereas fungi such as
yeast and Neurospora do not appear to have representatives of
the receptor kinase group, the slime mold, Dictyostelium discoi-
deum, has several examples (data not shown). None of these
sequences from slime mold has predicted signal peptide or
transmembrane regions, and most of the sequences are dual
specificity kinases based on their kinase activities (35), consistent
with the possibility that the ancestral form for extant receptor
kinases may have been soluble kinases.

Distribution of RLKs on Arabidopsis chromosomes provides clues for the
mechanisms of RLK family expansion. (A) The cladogram of the DUF26 subfamily

criterion. The color coding on branches indicates the chromosome on which each
gene in the subfamily is located. Note that most DUF26 members are located on
chromosome4.(B)ThecladogramofLRRX,XI,andXIIIsubfamilieswasgenerated

Diversification of the Plant RLKyPelle Family. The small number of
representatives of the RLKyPelle family in animals compared with
the much larger number in Arabidopsis indicates that the expansion
of the plant RLKs occurred after the divergence of plant and
animal lineages or that massive gene loss occurred in the animals.
A comparison of EST representation with the known total number
of RLKyPelle members in the fully sequenced genomes of C.
elegans, D. melanogaster, and Arabidopsis indicated that the EST
representation provided a conservative estimate of the total num-
ber of family members in the genomes. The lack of RLKyPelle
ESTs in Porphyra and Chlamydomonas argues that, rather than
massive gene loss in the animal genomes examined, the RLKyPelle
family likely underwent expansion after the divergence of animal
and plant lineages. Interestingly, all land plants have similar percent
representations of RLKyPelle kinases, suggesting that the size of
this gene family may have been similar to the present-day level
before the diversification of the land plant lineages. Additional
sequence information will be necessary to determine whether all
RLK subfamilies found in Arabidopsis are equally represented in
these other land plant lineages. The early expansion of the RLKy
Pelle family could be associated with evolution of multicellularity,
as has been suggested for the RTK family in animals (36). Alter-
natively, the expansion of the family could be associated with the
development of the complex array of attributes required for the
migration of plant lineages from the aquatic to the terrestrial
environment. Examination of RLKyPelle representation in multi-
cellular green algae such as Chara could help to resolve this
question.
The monophyletic origin of the RLKyPelle family implies that
the expansion of the family to its present size in Arabidopsis was
the result of multiple gene-duplication events. Two possible
mechanisms for the amplification of this family are suggested by
the way members of some subfamilies are distributed on the
Arabidopsis chromosomes. For example, the DUF26 subfamily is
organized in tandem arrays (Fig. 4C). These tandem arrays were
likely generated by gene duplications resulting from unequal
crossing-over as seen in the other gene families such as disease
resistance genes (37). Gene duplication is also driven by larger
scale duplication events, including polyploidization followed by
reshuffling of chromosomal regions (5, 38, 39). Tandem arrays
of DUF26 members are located in such duplicated regions on
chromosome 4. However, the localization of other DUF26
subfamily members almost exclusively on chromosome 4 suggests
that this subfamily expanded after the extensive chromosome
duplications and reshuffling identified for multiple regions of all
five Arabidopsis chromosomes (5, 38, 39).
On the other hand, members of LRR X, XI, and XIII
subfamilies are distributed among all five chromosomes, with
related genes on each branch of the phylogenetic tree generally
located on different chromosomes. These three related subfam-
ilies are of particular interest because they include Arabidopsis
RLKs with known developmental functions such as BRI1,
CLV1, ERECTA, and HAESA (6, 7, 10). The difference in
distribution patterns between the DUF26 and these LRR sub-
families could indicate that the LRR subfamilies originally
expanded by mechanisms that did not include localized (e.g.,
tandem) duplications. Given sufficient evolutionary time, sev-
eral rounds of polyploidization followed by chromosomal rear-
rangements could produce a given subfamily of the observed size
from a single prototypical gene. Alternatively, these LRR sub-
families may have originally expanded via localized duplications
that occurred early enough in evolutionary time that extensive
chromosome reshuffling could have eliminated linkage between
subfamily members. Both proposed mechanisms imply that the
LRR X, XI, and XIII subfamilies may have expanded much
earlier in time than the DUF26 subfamily. A comparative
analysis of RLK subfamilies in other plant lineages should help
to resolve this issue.
