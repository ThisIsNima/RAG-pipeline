The male-speciﬁc region of the Y chromosome, the MSY, differentiates the sexes and comprises 95% of the chromosome’s length.
Here, we report that the MSY is a mosaic of heterochromatic sequences and three classes of euchromatic sequences:
X-transposed, X-degenerate and ampliconic. These classes contain all 156 known transcription units, which include 78
protein-coding genes that collectively encode 27 distinct proteins. The X-transposed sequences exhibit 99% identity to the X
chromosome. The X-degenerate sequences are remnants of ancient autosomes from which the modern X and Y chromosomes
evolved. The ampliconic class includes large regions (about 30% of the MSY euchromatin) where sequence pairs show greater than
99.9% identity, which is maintained by frequent gene conversion (non-reciprocal transfer). The most prominent features here are
eight massive palindromes, at least six of which contain testis genes.
The history of human Y chromosome research can be divided into
three eras. The ﬁrst era focused on mendelian examination of
human family trees. In the opening decades of the twentieth
century, proponents of Mendel’s concept of the gene observed
three modes of inheritance in our species: autosomal recessive,
autosomal dominant and X-linked recessive. Contemporaneously,
other scholars sought to identify traits that exhibited Y-linked
(father to son) transmission. These scholars erroneously claimed
success, presenting family trees purported to demonstrate that
Y-chromosomal genes were responsible for hairy ears, scaly skin
and other traits. Meanwhile, light microscopic studies of human
cells provided strong physical evidence of the existence of a male-
speciﬁc chromosome1. By 1950, studies of human pedigrees
reported at least 17 Y-linked traits2.
The second era was dominated by the view that the Y chromo-
some was a genetic wasteland, based on the debunking of earlier
studies and a dearth of new evidence for genes. In the 1950s, Stern
systematically exposed critical ﬂaws in each of the preceding
pedigree studies and dismissed them2. In 1959, Jacobs’ study of
Klinefelter (XXY) males3 and Ford’s research on Turner (X0)
females4 demonstrated that the Y chromosome carries a pivotal
sex-determining gene, but this gene was considered to be an
exception on a generally desolate chromosome. In the 1960s,
Ohno proposed that the mammalian X and Y chromosomes had
evolved from an ordinary pair of autosomes5. Ohno speculated that
the X chromosome had retained the ancestral autosome’s gene
content whereas the Y chromosome had lost all but perhaps one
gene involved in sex determination. Thus emerged the understand-
ing of the human Y chromosome as a profoundly degenerate X
chromosome.
The hallmark of the third and present era has been the application
of recombinant DNA and genomic technologies to the Y chromo-
some, culminating in molecularly based conclusions about its genes.
In recent decades, an understanding of the Y chromosome’s
biological functions has begun to emerge from DNA studies of
individuals with partial Y chromosomes, coupled with molecular
characterization of Y-linked genes implicated in gonadal sex rever-
sal, Turner syndrome, graft rejection and spermatogenic failure6.
Genomic studies revealed that the Y chromosome contains a region,
comprising 95% of its length, where there is no X–Y crossing over.
This region came to be known as the non-recombining region, or
NRY, although our discovery of abundant recombination, as
reported here and in the accompanying manuscript, compels us
to rename it the male-speciﬁc region, or MSY7. The MSY is ﬂanked
on both sides by pseudoautosomal regions, where X–Y crossing over
is a normal and frequent event in male meiosis (see Supplementary
Note 1).
Previous efforts to construct accurate, high-resolution physical
maps of the MSY had been stymied by an abundance of lengthy,
intrachromosomal repetitive sequences, or amplicons8. To over-
come this difﬁculty, we identiﬁed minute variations between
amplicon copies, and then highlighted these minute variants
(sequence family variants9) as markers to be ordered with respect
to one another, yielding a map amenable to iterative reﬁnement.
However, the minute variants could only be found by fully and
accurately sequencing and comparing near-identical amplicon
copies. Thus, in our effort to determine the nucleotide sequence
of the MSY, mapping and sequencing activities were fused into a
single, iterative analytic process. We have previously reported the
physical map that emerged from these efforts10. Here we report the
sequencing of the MSY.
We mapped and sequenced a tiling path of 220 bacterial artiﬁcial
chromosome (BAC) clones, each containing a portion of the MSY
from the same individual. We used only one man’s Y chromosome

to prevent any allelic variation, or polymorphism, from confound-
ing our search for minute sequence variation between amplicon
copies. (MSYamplicon copies can differ as little in sequence as two Y
chromosomes chosen at random from the population11.) We chose
to sequence highly redundant BACs, especially in amplicon-rich
regions: about 12.7 million (roughly 60%) of the euchromatic
nucleotides were sequenced in at least two independent BAC clones.
This redundancy allowed us to reﬁne and validate the MSY sequence
by exhaustively investigating, and in most cases resolving, sequence
discrepancies between overlapping BACs.
Sequencing of euchromatic and heterochromatic regions
We begin with a statistical synopsis of the MSY sequence, consider-
ing the euchromatic and heterochromatic portions separately. (In
this analysis, we have equated satellite sequences with heterochro-
matin, and all other sequences with euchromatin.) The product of
our present research is a ‘reference’ sequence from one man’s
Y chromosome. A full description of the nature and extent of
Y chromosome variation in human populations must await future
studies. We and our colleagues have previously reported the
nucleotide sequence of two portions of the MSY (the AZFa and
AZFc regions12,13). We have incorporated this previously reported
sequence data in our present analysis of the entire MSY.
The MSY’s euchromatic DNA sequences total roughly 23 mega-
bases (Mb), including 8 Mb on the short arm (Yp) and 14.5 Mb on
the long arm (Yq) (Fig. 1). We obtained ﬁnished sequence, with an
estimated error rate of about 1 per 105 nucleotides, for all MSY
euchromatin, with two known exceptions. First, there remain two
gaps, each of which is roughly 50 kilobases (kb) long as judged by
chromosomal ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (Sup-
plementary Fig. 1). Second, we obtained representative but incom-
plete sequence for a tandem array that spans roughly 0.7 Mb on Yp.
We estimate that we obtained ﬁnished nucleotide sequence for
roughly 97% of the MSYeuchromatin, and that we captured 99% of
the sequence complexity of MSY’s euchromatin.
So far, efforts to gain sequence-based understanding of human
chromosomes have largely by-passed heterochromatic regions (refs
14, 15; see also Supplementary Note 2), including a large block of
heterochromatic sequences found in the centromeric region of
every nuclear chromosome16. In addition to its centromeric hetero-
chromatin (approximately 1 Mb, ref. 17), the Y chromosome was
previously shown to contain a second, much longer heterochro-
matic block (roughly 40 Mb) that comprises the bulk of the distal
long arm (Fig. 1; see also Supplementary Note 3). In the course of
the present sequencing project, we discovered and characterized a
third heterochromatic block—a sharply demarcated island that
spans approximately 400 kb, comprises .3,000 tandem repeats of
125 base pairs (bp), and interrupts the euchromatic sequences of
proximal Yq (Figs 1 and 2). The other two heterochromatic blocks
also consist of massively ampliﬁed tandem repeats of low sequence
complexity. We attempted to sequence BACs spanning the bound-
aries and representing the body of each of the three heterochromatic
blocks. We succeeded, with the exception that the distal boundary of
the major heterochromatic region, on distal Yq, was not identiﬁed
with certainty (Supplementary Fig. 1). In total, we found that the
heterochromatin of MSYencompasses at least six distinct sequence
species (Table 1), each of which form long, homogeneous tandem
arrays. Our ﬁndings are detailed in Supplementary Note 4 and
Supplementary Fig. 3.
A catalogue of genes and transcription units
With a comprehensive reference sequence of the MSY in hand, we
set out to catalogue systematically the genes of the MSY. We
electronically identiﬁed and manually examined all matches to
previously reported MSY genes. Furthermore, we used polymerase
chain reaction with reverse transcription (RT–PCR) and/or sequen-
cing of complementary DNA clones to evaluate electronic matches
to publicly available expressed sequence tags (ESTs), as well as
potential genes that were predicted using GenomeScan software18.
For all experimentally veriﬁed genes whose expression patterns had
not been reported previously, we tested for expression in diverse
human tissues by RT–PCR and subsequent sequencing of RT–PCR
products.
We found that the MSY includes at least 156 transcription units,
half of which probably encode proteins (Table 2 and Figs 2, 3; see
also Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). All 156 transcription units
identiﬁed are located in euchromatic sequences. We have no
evidence of transcription of the MSY heterochromatin. Of the
approximately 78 protein-coding units, about 60 are members of
nine different MSY-speciﬁc gene families, each characterized by
.98% nucleotide identity among family members, in both exons
and introns. The remaining 18 protein-coding genes are present in
one copy each in the MSY. (These include two genes, RPS4Y1 and
RPS4Y2, that exhibit 93.6% nucleotide identity in coding exons but
are much more diverged in introns.) Thus, the MSY seems to

encode at least 27 distinct proteins or protein families.
Furthermore, the MSY includes at least 78 transcription units for
which strong evidence of protein coding is lacking; many of these
transcription units are probably non-coding. Of these 78 transcrip-
tion units, 13 occur in single copy in the MSYand the remaining 65
are members of 15 MSY-speciﬁc families. Considering together
both coding and non-coding transcription units, the MSY appears
to contain 24 MSY-speciﬁc families, which collectively account for
125 of the 156 MSY transcription units identiﬁed so far.
On the basis of earlier experiments, most of the genes of the MSY
were thought to fall into two functional classes, with genes in the
ﬁrst group expressed throughout the body, in many organs, and
genes in the second group expressed predominantly or exclusively in
testes19. Our present catalogue of MSY genes and their patterns of
tissue expression (Table 2) corroborate this model. Of the MSY’s 27
distinct protein-coding genes or gene families identiﬁed so far, 12
are expressed ubiquitously and 11 are expressed exclusively or
predominantly in testes.
Three classes of sequences in the MSY euchromatin
We ﬁnd that nearly all of the euchromatic sequences fall into three
classes, which we have named X-transposed, X-degenerate and
ampliconic. As shown in Figs 1 and 2, the MSY euchromatin is a
patchwork of these three sequence classes. The characteristics of the
classes are summarized in Fig. 4.
The X-transposed sequences are 99% identical to DNA sequences
in Xq21, a band in the midst of the long arm of the human X
chromosome. The X-transposed sequences are so named because
their presence in the human MSY is the result of a massive X-to-Y
transposition that occurred about 3–4 million years ago, after the
divergence of the human and chimpanzee lineages20–22. Sub-
sequently, an inversion within the MSY short arm cleaved the
X-transposed block into two non-contiguous segments, as observed
in the modern MSY (Figs 1 and 2)21,22. The X-transposed sequences
do not participate in X–Y crossing over during male meiosis,
distinguishing them from the pseudoautosomal sequences found
in the telomeric regions of the human X and Y chromosomes.
Within the X-transposed segments, which have a combined
length of 3.4 Mb, we identiﬁed only two genes, both of which
have homologues in Xq21 (Table 2). Thus the X-transposed
sequences exhibit the lowest density of genes among the three
sequence classes in the MSY euchromatin (Figs 1 and 3), as well as
the highest density of interspersed repeat elements (Fig. 1). In
particular, long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE1) elements
account for 36% of all X-transposed sequence, or nearly twice the
genome average of 20%14,15. As expected, low gene density and high
repeat density also characterize the homologous sequence block in
Xq21.
In contrast to the X-transposed sequence blocks, the X-degen-
erate segments of the MSY are dotted with single-copy gene or
pseudogene homologues of 27 different X-linked genes. These
single-copy MSY genes and pseudogenes display between 60%
and 96% nucleotide sequence identity to their X-linked homo-
logues, and they seem to be surviving relics of ancient autosomes
from which the X and Y chromosomes co-evolved, as explained
below. In 13 cases, the MSY homologue is a pseudogene with
sequence similarity to exons and introns of the functional X
homologue (Supplementary Table 3). In the remaining 14 cases,
the MSY homologue seems to be a transcribed, functional gene, and
the X- and Y-linked genes encode very similar but non-identical
protein isoforms (Table 2 and Figs 2, 3). These include two cases in
which a functional X-linked gene has two expressed homologues in
the MSY. The Y-linked genes RPS4Y1 and RPS4Y2 are full-length
homologues of the X-linked gene RPS4X, and they apparently
encode two different, full-length isoforms of ribosomal protein
S4. In contrast, the Y-linked genes CYorf15A and CYorf15B are
homologous to, respectively, 5
0 and 3
0 portions of the X-linked gene
CXorf15, and they apparently encode proteins homologous to,
respectively, amino- and carboxy-terminal portions of the predicted
CXORF15 protein (Supplementary Fig. 4). Together, the X-degen-
erate sequences encode 16 of the MSY’s 27 distinct proteins or
protein families.
Notably, all 12 ubiquitously expressed MSY genes reside in the
X-degenerate regions; no such genes have been identiﬁed elsewhere
in the MSY. Conversely, among the 11 MSY genes found to be
expressed predominantly in testes, only one gene, the sex-determin-
ing SRY, is X-degenerate.
The third class of euchromatic sequences, the ampliconic seg-
ments, are composed largely of sequences that exhibit marked
similarity—as much as 99.9% identity over tens or hundreds of
kilobases—to other sequences in the MSY. We refer to these long,
MSY-speciﬁc repeat units, of which there are many families, as
amplicons. The amplicons are located in seven segments that are
scattered across the euchromatic long arm and proximal short arm
(Figs 1 and 2), and whose combined length is 10.2 Mb.
We identiﬁed these ampliconic regions through a comprehensive
analysis of similarities within the sequenced portions of the MSY.
We calculated the percentage nucleotide identity between all pairs of
known MSY sequences and then plotted the data in two ways. First
we determined, at each point along the length of the sequenced
MSY, the highest intrachromosomal similarity. The resulting graph
(Fig. 5c) identiﬁes the ampliconic regions as those where intrachro-
mosomal identity, over stretches of 50 kb or more, generally exceeds
50%. Notably, 60% (6.1 Mb) of the ampliconic sequences exhibit
intrachromosomal identities of 99.9% or greater.
A more spatially detailed representation of intrachromosomal
similarities is shown in Fig. 5a, which records the locations of all
MSY sequence pairs characterized by at least 65% identity within a
sliding window of 2,000 nucleotides. After heterochromatic and
LINE1 repeats have been accounted for, the MSY is seen to contain
many long stretches of sequence that are similar to those elsewhere
in the MSY. As shown in the inset to Fig. 5a, the triangular plot can
be broken down into two smaller triangles—one representing
sequence comparisons within Yp, the other depicting comparisons

within Yq—and a rectangle depicting comparisons between Yp and
Yq. Scrutiny of these Yp, Yq and Yp–Yq components of the plot
reveals a wealth of sequence similarities within and between
ampliconic segments on both arms of the chromosome.
The ampliconic sequences exhibit by far the highest density of
genes, both coding and non-coding, among the three sequence
classes in the MSY euchromatin (Figs 1 and 3). We identiﬁed nine
distinct MSY-speciﬁc protein-coding gene families, with copy
numbers ranging from two (VCY, XKRY, HSFY, PRY) to three
(BPY2) to four (CDY, DAZ) to six (RBMY) to approximately 35
(TSPY) (Table 2 and Figs 2, 3). (These copy numbers pertain to the
particular Y chromosome that we sequenced; they may vary in
human populations.) In aggregate, these nine coding families
encompass roughly 60 transcription units. Furthermore, the ampli-
conic sequences include at least 75 other transcription units for
which strong evidence of protein coding is lacking (Figs 2 and 3; see
also Supplementary Table 2). Of these 75 putative non-coding
transcription units, 65 are members of 15 MSY-speciﬁc families,
and the remaining 10 occur in single copy. Considering together
both coding and non-coding elements, the ampliconic sequences
contain 135 of the 156 MSY transcription units identiﬁed so far.
In contrast to the ubiquitous expression of most X-degenerate
genes, the ampliconic genes and transcription units show highly
restricted expression (Table 2). All nine protein-coding families in
the ampliconic regions are expressed predominantly or exclusively
in testes, as are most of the regions’ non-coding transcription units.
Among the three euchromatic sequence classes, the ampliconic
sequences exhibit by far the lowest densities of LINE1 and total
interspersed repeat elements (Fig. 1). Indeed, the interspersed
repeat content of the MSY’s ampliconic sequences (35%) is far
below the mean for the human genome (44%; z-test yields
P ,, 0.000001).
Eight palindromes comprising 25% of MSY euchromatin
The most pronounced structural features of the ampliconic regions of
Yq are eight massive palindromes (Table 3). In the dot plot of Fig. 5a,
the longer palindromes are visible as vertical blue lines that approach
thebaseline. An MSY maphighlightingalleightpalindromesisshown
in Fig. 3a. In all eight palindromes, the arms are highly symmetrical,
with arm-to-arm nucleotide identities of 99.94–99.997%. (By con-
vention, these percentage identities refer only to nucleotide substi-
tutions and do not take account of insertions and deletions by which
palindrome arms differ.) The palindromes are long, their arms
ranging from 9 kb to 1.45Mb in length. They are imperfect in that
each contains a unique, non-duplicated spacer, 2–170 kb in length, at
its centre. Palindrome P1 is particularly spectacular, having a span of
2.9 Mb, an arm-to-arm identity of 99.97%, and bearing two second-
ary palindromes (P1.1 and P1.2, each with a span of 24kb) within its
arms13. The eight palindromes collectively comprise 5.7 Mb, or one-
quarter of the MSYeuchromatin.
Six of the eight palindromes carry recognized protein-coding
genes, all of which seem to be expressed speciﬁcally in testes
(Fig. 3b). In all known cases of genes on MSY palindromes, identical
or nearly identical gene copies exist on opposite arms of the
palindrome. Of the nine multi-copy, protein-coding gene families
identiﬁed so far in the MSY, eight have members on palindromes.
Indeed, six families are located exclusively in palindromes. These
include the DAZ genes, which exist in four copies—two in palin-
drome P1 and two in P2—and the CDY genes, which also occur in
four copies—two in P1 and two in P5 (Fig. 3b). In addition, the
palindromes contain at least seven families of apparently non-
coding transcription units, all expressed exclusively or predomi-
nantly in testes (Fig. 3e).
In addition to the eight palindromes, the ampliconic regions of
Yq and Yp contain ﬁve sets of more widely spaced inverted repeats
with repeat lengths of 62–298 kb (Fig. 2; see also Supplementary
Table 4). Three of these inverted repeat pairs (IR1, IR2 and IR3)
exhibit nucleotide identities of 99.66–99.95%. Inversion of the IR3
repeats, both located on Yp, was probably a direct consequence of
the molecular evolutionary event that cleaved the X-transposed
sequences into two non-contiguous segments (Supplementary
Fig. 5). Subsequent homologous recombination between inverted
IR3 repeats was responsible, we suspect, for a 3.6-Mb inversion
polymorphism observed on the short arm of the modern Y
chromosome (Supplementary Figs 5 and 6)10.
Transcriptionally active tandem arrays
In addition to palindromes and inverted repeats, the ampliconic
regions of Yq and Yp contain a variety of long tandem arrays.
Prominent among these are the newly identiﬁed NORF (no long
open reading frame) clusters, which in aggregate account for about
622 kb on Yp and Yq, and the previously reported TSPY clusters,
which comprise about 700 kb of Yp (Fig. 2). Triangular dot plots
that highlight the regularities and relatively crisp borders of the
NORF and TSPYarrays are shown in Supplementary Fig. 7 (see also
Supplementary Note 5).
The NORF arrays are based on a repeat unit of 2.48 kb. A
consensus sequence for the repeat is readily identiﬁable (Sup-
plementary File 2), but the sequence of individual repeat elements
typically diverges from that consensus by 14–20%. The NORF
arrays are so named because they harbour a great diversity of spliced
but apparently non-coding transcription units, including the
TTTY1, TTTY2, TTTY6, TTTY7, TTTY8, TTTY18, TTTY19,
TTTY21 and TTTY22 families. Both strands of the NORF arrays
are transcribed; 3
0 portions of the TTTY1 and TTTY2 transcripts are
complementary (Supplementary Fig. 8).
The TSPYarrays are based on a 20.4-kb repeat unit23 that encodes,
on one strand, a previously identiﬁed protein, TSPY. A newly
identiﬁed transcription unit, CYorf16, is found on the opposite

strand; its protein coding potential remains to be tested. Approxi-
mately 35 copies of this repeat unit—and hence 35 TSPY genes and
35 CYorf16 transcription units—are found in a single, highly regular
tandem array in proximal Yp (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 7d, e);
here the sequences of individual repeat units rarely differ from the
consensus by more than 1%. Furthermore, a single, isolated TSPY
repeat unit, whose sequence diverges 3% from the consensus, is
located more distally in Yp, embedded in the distal IR3 inverted
repeat (Fig. 2). The 35-unit TSPY cluster is the largest and most
homogeneous protein-coding tandem array identiﬁed so far in the
human genome.
The evolution of the MSY
On the basis of our present ﬁndings and previous studies, we
propose a model of MSYevolution that addresses all three euchro-
matic sequence classes (Figs 6 and 7). In developing the model, we
will offer an evolutionary map of the MSY (Fig. 8). We will then
consider the two largest and most gene-rich sequence classes—X-
degenerate and ampliconic—arguing that two opposed evolution-
ary dynamics have been at work: gene decay versus gene acquisition
and conservation. Throughout, we will propose decisive roles for
modulation of DNA recombination, both crossing over and gene
conversion, in the evolution and on-going maintenance of the MSY
(Fig. 9).
The human X and Y chromosomes are thought to have evolved
from an ordinary pair of autosomes5,24. Support for this hypothesis,
and a proposed 300-million-year timeline for human sex chromo-
some evolution, have emerged from studies of modern X–Y gene
pairs. In this context, investigators have interpreted the X–Y gene
pairs as surviving ‘fossils’ where extensive sequence identity
between ancestral X and Y chromosomes once existed25,26. Our
present sequencing of the MSYeuchromatin expands the catalogue
of known X–Y gene pair fossils, providing opportunity to re-
examine models developed in earlier studies.
Evolutionary stratiﬁcation of X–Y genes
Lahn and Page previously studied the evolutionary ages of X–Y gene
pairs, as measured by synonymous X–Y nucleotide divergence, or
Ks (ref. 26). They reasoned that X–Y differentiation would have
begun only after X–Y crossing over ceased. They observed a strong
correlation between the age (Ks) of individual X–Y gene pairs and
the locations of their X members on the human X chromosome.

Among the 19 X–Y gene pairs studied, age increased in a stepwise
fashion along the length of the X chromosome, in four ‘evolutionary
strata’. This suggested that at least four events had punctuated
human sex chromosome evolution, with each event suppressing
X–Y crossing over in one stratum without grossly disturbing gene
order in the X chromosome.
We re-analysed this published information and combined the
results with Ks and map location data for 12 additional X–Y gene
pairs, thus compiling data on 31 X–Y pairs in all (Supplementary
Table 5). In each of 27 pairs, the Y member is an X-degenerate gene
or pseudogene. The other four pairs include two in which the Y
member is an X-transposed gene and two in which the Y members
are ampliconic gene families.
Among all X-degenerate pairs, and the two ampliconic pairs, the
previously reported correlation between age (K s) and X map
position is readily apparent, with age increasing from the distal
short arm to the long arm of the X chromosome (Fig. 7). Further-
more, as observed in the earlier study, the order of the homologous
genes in the MSY appears to be scrambled with respect to Ks
(Supplementary Fig. 9). These observations, together with the

earlier arguments of Lahn and Page, suggest three conclusions. First,
all MSY genes and pseudogenes identiﬁed here as X-degenerate
seem to be products of a single molecular evolutionary process: the
region-by-region suppression of crossing over in ancestral auto-
somes, with subsequent differentiation of the Y from the X
chromosome (Fig. 6). Second, at least two of the MSY’s ampliconic
gene families, VCY and RBMY, also originated in this manner, but
subsequently acquired the characteristics of ampliconic sequences
(Fig. 6; for independent evidence concerning RBMY see refs 27
and 28). Third, as previously hypothesized, inversions in the Y
chromosome may have suppressed crossing over with the X
chromosome.
X-transposed genes as exceptions
A very different evolutionary model accounts for the X-transposed
genes, as conﬁrmed by our Ks analysis. If, as hypothesized, these
MSY genes are the result of a single, recent transposition from the X
chromosome (Fig. 6), then the Ks values of the two X-transposed
X–Y gene pairs should be similar to each other but much lower
than the K s values of the nearby (X-degenerate) pairs in the
X-chromosome long arm. This prediction is met (Fig. 7). The two
X-transposed X–Y gene pairs seem to be orders of magnitude
younger than the ancient pairs (group 1 in Fig. 7) among which
they are physically situated in the X chromosome.
Blurred boundaries
Our observations differ from those of Lahn and Page in that the
boundaries between X–Y gene groups 2 and 3, and between groups 3
and 4, now seem less distinct (Fig. 7; compare with Fig. 2 in ref. 26).
Whereas our present observations could be interpreted as evidence
that suppression of X–Y crossing over evolved in more than four
steps, such a conclusion would be premature. The apparent overlaps

between groups could be artefacts of local errors in ordering
X-linked genes, these regions not yet having been fully sequenced,
or simply of large standard errors for some Ks estimates (Fig. 7).
Some changes in local gene order in the X chromosome may also
have occurred during its evolution. Another potentially confound-
ing factor is X–Y gene conversion, which would depress Ks values
and estimated ages for gene-converted X–Y pairs. Gene conversion
depends on high sequence similarity, and thus one might expect any
such effect to be greater among the younger X–Y pairs, in groups 3
and 4. Indeed, comparisons of X and Y genomic sequences suggest
that the VCX/Y pair and 3
0 portions of the KAL1/P pair (both pairs
in group 4) have engaged in extensive gene conversion (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 10), depressing their Ks values below those of the 5
0 portion
of the KAL1/P pair and of other group 4 pairs (Fig. 7).
A map of male-speciﬁc ages
Having examined the evolutionary ages of all 31 X–Y gene pairs, we
used them to anchor an evolutionary map of the modern human
MSY. The map displays the male-speciﬁc ages of many sequence
segments (Fig. 8). Here, male-speciﬁc age is the estimated number
of years that have passed since sequences ancestral to that segment
were incorporated into the MSY (having previously been autoso-
mal, pseudoautosomal, or X-linked). We estimated the age of each
gene or segment using Lahn and Page’s methods that combined Ks
analysis (Supplementary Table 5) with comparative gene mapping
data from other mammals. The resulting estimated ages are graphed
on a logarithmic scale to accommodate a range that extends from
approximately 4 million years (the X-transposed sequences; the
youngest known sequences in the MSY) to approximately 300
million years (SRY, the sex determinant and arguably the oldest
gene in the MSY).
As can be seen in Fig. 8, the MSY euchromatin is an elaborate
patchwork of sequences of diverse male-speciﬁc ages. The result of a
single, recent transposition from the X-chromosome, the MSY’s
X-transposed sequences are homogeneously youthful. The

Figure 6 Molecular evolutionary pathways and processes that gave rise to genes in three
MSY euchromatic sequence classes. X-degenerate genes and pseudogenes (yellow
background) derived from an autosomal pair that was ancestral to both the X and Y
chromosomes (and that was enlarged by subsequent fusion with other autosomes or
autosomal segments50). X-transposed genes (pink background) derived from X-linked
genes, which in turn derived from the ancestral autosomal pair. Ampliconic genes (blue
background) were derived through three converging processes: ampliﬁcation of
X-degenerate genes (for example, RBMY, VCY); transposition and ampliﬁcation of
autosomal genes (DAZ); and retroposition and ampliﬁcation of autosomal genes (CDY).
Boxes enumerate dominant themes in X-degenerate (yellow) and ampliconic (blue) gene
evolution. The asterisk indicates that Y–Y gene conversion is apparently common in the

sequences of both the X-degenerate and ampliconic classes are
much older, and they display a wide range of male-speciﬁc ages
(Fig. 8). As we will argue, it is in comparing and contrasting these
two chronologically diverse classes that the central themes of MSY
evolution and function are revealed most clearly.
Evolutionary dynamics of X-degenerate and ampliconic
sequences
To appreciate the evolutionary dynamics of these two sequence
classes, we need to consider both their similarities and differences.
In many senses, the X-degenerate and ampliconic sequences
together dominate the euchromatic MSY. The X-degenerate and
ampliconic classes are physically intermingled in the MSY, and they
are comparably large, constituting, respectively, 38% and 45% of the
MSY’s euchromatic sequences (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 6).
Together, these two sequence classes carry all but two of the MSY’s
78 known protein-coding transcription units (Table 2). The
X-degenerate and ampliconic classes display comparable diversities
of male-speciﬁc ages, from tens to hundreds of millions of years
(Fig. 8). This implies that X-degenerate and ampliconic sequences
evolved in parallel, as parts of a single DNA molecule, for as much as
300 million years. Moreover, we infer that the X-degenerate and
ampliconic sequences evolved under similar, unusual circum-
stances: both were transmitted exclusively through the male germ
line, and neither participated in meiotic crossing over with a
homologous counterpart. However, a number of marked structural
and functional differences between these two sequence classes
suggest that they followed different evolutionary trajectories. Palin-
dromes are prevalent in ampliconic sequences. The density of
transcription units is much higher and the density of interspersed
repeats is much lower in ampliconic than in X-degenerate sequences
(Fig. 1). The two sequence classes also diverge starkly with respect to
gene-expression patterns. Most X-degenerate genes are expressed
widely throughout the body, and many are probably involved in
cellular housekeeping activities that are critical in both males and
females. In contrast, most ampliconic genes are expressed predo-
minantly or exclusively in testes, where they probably function in
spermatogenesis.
Decay in the absence of sexual recombination
The X-degenerate sequences are adequately explained by the pre-
vailing theory of sex chromosome evolution, which states that as the
X and Y chromosomes evolved from an autosomal pair, the X
chromosome maintained most of its ancestor’s genes whereas the Y
chromosome lost them5,24–26. Our ﬁndings support the two major
premises of this theory: the evolutionary genetic beneﬁts of sexual
recombination through meiotic crossing over, and the deleterious
consequences of its absence. According to this theory, most ances-
tral genes remained functionally intact in the X chromosome, where
the beneﬁts of crossing over (in females) continued. In the Y
chromosome, in contrast, the shutting down of X–Y crossing over
during evolution triggered a monotonic decline in gene function.
This model is corroborated by the presence, in the MSY’s X-
degenerate sequences, of decayed, intron-bearing pseudogenes of
Figure 8 Evolutionary map of the MSY. At the bottom is an MSY schematic, as in Fig. 1b.

13 different X-linked genes (Supplementary Table 3). Presumably,
many hundreds of other X-homologous genes were deleted outright
from the evolving MSY, leaving no trace in the DNA sequence of the
modern human MSY. Seen in this light, the 16 protein-coding genes
in the modern MSY’s X-degenerate sequences (Table 2 and Fig. 3)
appear as rare examples of persistence in the absence of sexual
recombination.
Acquisition and conservation of spermatogenic functions
This evolutionary model of the Y chromosome as a decaying X
chromosome, however, provides no explanation for central charac-
teristics of the MSY’s ampliconic sequences, including testis-speciﬁc
gene expression, near-perfect palindromes, and an abundance of
autosomal (as well as X-chromosomal) sequence similarities. To
account for these characteristics, we propose that the MSYacquired,
and evolved a means of conserving, genes that speciﬁcally enhanced
male fertility.
Unlike the X-degenerate sequences, all of which trace to the
MSY’s shared ancestry with the X chromosome, the ampliconic
sequences evolved from a great variety of genomic sources, and by a
diversity of molecular mechanisms (Fig. 6). As mentioned pre-
viously, the ampliconic genes VCY and RBMY were, similar to the
X-degenerate genes, derived from common ancestors of the X and Y
chromosomes27,28. In contrast, the DAZ genes arose, during primate
evolution, by transposition and subsequent ampliﬁcation of an
autosomal transcription unit, DAZL, which still exists on human
chromosome 3 (ref. 29). Indeed, systematic analysis of MSY/auto-
some similarities suggests that a series of autosomal transpositions
contributed to the MSY’s ampliconic sequences during primate
evolution (Fig. 8; see also ref. 13). Yet another molecular mechanism
accounts for the CDY genes, which arose by retroposition (and
subsequent ampliﬁcation) of a processed messenger RNA derived
from an autosomal gene30. This retroposition event was previously
thought to have occurred during primate evolution, but our present
Ks analysis indicates a much older date, probably before the lineages
of marsupials and placental mammals diverged (Fig. 8; see also
Supplementary Table 5).
Despite the wide variety of genomic sources and molecular
evolutionary mechanisms that gave rise to the ampliconic genes,
they all came to exist in the MSY in multiple, nearly identical copies,
and they evolved remarkably uniform patterns of tissue expression.
Indeed, detailed studies of several ampliconic gene families have
revealed that they are expressed predominantly or exclusively in one
cell lineage: the spermatogenic cells of the testis. What accounts for
this convergence of evolutionary outcomes? The genesis of XY sex
chromosomes during mammalian evolution, and speciﬁcally the
emergence of a male-speciﬁc domain, created a genomic niche
where selection could operate to enhance male germ-cell develop-
ment. Ampliﬁcation of the testis genes might have enhanced sperm
production through high levels of expression. However, in a region
devoid of crossing over, ampliﬁcation might also have allowed
another type of homologous recombination, gene conversion, to
emerge as a means of conserving gene function.
Abundant Y–Y gene conversion in ampliconic regions
Gene conversion is the non-reciprocal transfer of sequence infor-
mation from one DNA duplex to another31. This type of genetic
recombination has been studied most extensively in fungi, where it
was originally demonstrated to occur between chromosome homo-
logues, or at lower frequency between sister chromatids, in meiosis.
It was later shown that gene conversion could also occur between
duplicated sequences on a single chromosome, and in mitosis32.
Here we will argue that gene conversion (non-reciprocal recombi-
nation) is as frequent in the MSY as crossing over (reciprocal
recombination) is in ordinary chromosomes.
Speciﬁcally, two major ﬁndings provide evidence that gene
conversion occurs routinely in 30% of the MSY euchromatin,
including nearly all of the MSY’s testis-speciﬁc gene families. The
accompanying study7 reports the identiﬁcation and sequencing of
chimpanzee Y-linked orthologues of human MSY palindromes and
establishes that gene conversion between palindrome arms has
occurred in both the human and chimpanzee lineages, and has
continued to occur in human populations. Here we report that
these palindromes are representative of a large, discrete fraction of
MSY sequences, all of which bear at least 99.9% identity to other
MSY sequences. These ﬁndings suggest that the entire fraction is
subject to frequent gene conversion.
Above we described calculations of percentage nucleotide iden-
tity between all pairs of known MSY sequences. We deﬁned and
mapped the ampliconic regions by reporting, at each point along
the length of the MSYeuchromatin, the highest percentage identity
to other MSY sequences (intrachromosomal similarity; Fig. 5). To
view this data from another perspective, we electronically fraction-
ated all MSY sequences according to intrachromosomal similarity.
As seen in Fig. 9a, 30% of MSY euchromatic sequences display
intrachromosomal identities of 99.9–100%. As intrachromosomal
identity declines below 99.9%, the fractional representation of MSY
sequences drops abruptly. Thus, the sequences displaying intra-
chromosomal identities of $99.9% represent a large and distinct
subset of the MSY euchromatin.
This $99.9% subset comprises the eight palindromes as well as
large portions of the IR2 and IR3 inverted repeats described above
(Figs 2 and 3). Indeed, nearly all of the $99.9% sequences exist as
pairs in inverted orientation. Thus, the MSY palindromes in which
gene conversion has been demonstrated7 are typical and represen-
tative of the $99.9% fraction. We extrapolate that nearly all of the
$99.9% fraction is engaged in gene conversion on a routine basis,
resulting in a degree of identity among MSY’s inverted sequence
pairs that rivals that of two autosomal homologues, or alleles,
chosen at random from the human population15,33.

Two modes of productive recombination in the human Y chromosome
Combined with previous discoveries in the pseudoautosomal
regions, the present ﬁndings imply that two modes of homologous
recombination occur regularly in the human Y chromosome. First,
there is crossing over with the X chromosome in the pseudoauto-
somal regions (aggregate length 3.0 Mb) (Supplementary Note 6).
Second, there is Y–Y gene conversion in the $99.9% regions
(aggregate length 6.1 Mb) dispersed throughout the MSY
(Fig. 9b)7. We refer to both routine modes of Y chromosome
recombination as ‘productive’ to distinguish them from the rela-
tively rare, aberrant recombination events (typically Y–Y or X–Y)
that perturb sex differentiation or fertility and thereby diminish the
reproductive ﬁtness of affected individuals.
Genetic mapping studies have shown that, typically, one X–Y
crossover occurs per generation in the pseudoautosomal regions
(Supplementary Note 7). As described in the accompanying report7,
steady-state calculations suggest that, on average, multiple Y–Y gene
conversion events take place per generation in the MSY. Thus, most
homologous recombination events in the Y chromosome probably
occur in the MSY.
In recent years, we and other investigators have referred to the
MSYas the NRY, or ‘non-recombining region of the Y chromosome’.
This usage reﬂected both awareness that productive X–Y crossing
over did not occur in the MSY, and ignorance of the Y–Y gene
conversion that is apparently commonplace there. We now refer to
the NRYas the MSY, or ‘male-speciﬁc region of the Y chromosome’,
because it is recombinogenic and unique to males.
Gene conversion and the MSY’s testis gene families
Examination of the MSY’s testis gene families provides additional
insight into the potential biological signiﬁcance of the $99.9%
fraction and the gene conversion associated with it. Eight of the
MSY’s nine identiﬁed testis gene families have members in the
palindromes or inverted repeats that comprise the $99.9% fraction
just described. (The exceptional family is TSPY, most of whose
members are found in a long tandem array.) Many of these family
members are intact gene copies, but others are apparent pseudo-
genes with disrupted splice sites or reading frames. For each of the
eight testis gene families, we counted the numbers of intact and
pseudogene copies, both within and without the $99.9% fraction
(Table 4). Whereas large numbers of pseudogenes are present both
inside and outside the $99.9% fraction, the intact gene copies, 25 in
all, are located exclusively in the $99.9% fraction.
Thus, there is an evident association of intact testis genes with
near-identical inverted sequence pairs that undergo gene conver-
sion. What is the biological signiﬁcance of this association? We
envision two possibilities, which are not mutually exclusive. First,
we note that in all cases examined so far, expression of these testis-
speciﬁc gene families has been found to be limited to or most
pronounced in cells of the spermatogenic lineage—in germ cells.
Perhaps these near-identical sequence pairs are transcriptionally
active in germ cells because there they generate cruciforms or other
unusual chromatin conﬁgurations. Second, the occurrence of MSY
gene pairs that are subject to frequent gene conversion might
provide a mechanism for conserving gene functions across evol-
utionary time in the absence of crossing over.
Implications for future studies
We anticipate that the nucleotide sequence reported here, and the
methods with which it was obtained, will ﬁnd many applications in
human biology and beyond.

of departure for systematic, comprehensive characterization of MSY
sequence variation in human populations. The MSY’s unique
characteristics—male speciﬁcity, no crossing over and abundant
gene conversion—suggest that its sequence variation might differ
markedly from that of ordinary human chromosomes. Already the
availability of MSY sequence information in public databases has
accelerated the emergence of MSY sequence variation as a powerful
tool in reconstructing the patrilineal origins of modern human
populations11,34.
Comparisons (or lack of) with other species
Little is known about the DNA sequences of Y chromosomes in
other animals or plants, and thus it is not possible at present to
compare systematically the human MSY with that of any other
species. Both the Drosophila and mouse Y chromosomes contain
genes required for spermatogenesis, but meagre Y chromosome
sequence data is available in either species. In Drosophila, the
sequences of autosomes and the X chromosome were assembled
from whole-genome shotgun data. Unfortunately, this shotgun
analysis was insufﬁcient to assemble much Y chromosome
sequence35,36, conﬁrming prior suspicions that, in Drosophila as in
humans, the Y chromosome poses special challenges. In the mouse,
a draft sequence of the female genome is available37, but systematic
efforts to sequence the male-speciﬁc region of the Y chromosome
have yet to be initiated. If undertaken, Y chromosome sequencing
projects in Drosophila, mouse and other species are likely to
encounter special technical hurdles, but they are also likely to
yield entirely unforeseen biological insights, as was the case here
for the human MSY. The availability of human MSY sequence has
already enabled new tests and rekindled debate of Haldane’s
hypothesis that mutations in the male germ line greatly outnumber
those in the female germ line (Supplementary Note 8). This debate
will surely be fuelled by sequencing of other primate and mamma-
lian Y chromosomes.
Methods for sequencing difﬁcult genomic regions
Our strategy of iterative mapping and sequencing was laborious but
essential. Two faster, less costly strategies have been used recently in
sequencing large genomes: whole-genome shotgun analysis15,35 and
sequencing a tiling path of mapped clones (ref. 14 and Supplemen-
tary Note 9). Neither of these sequencing strategies would have
yielded a coherent picture of the MSY. This is especially true of the
MSY’s ampliconic regions, and most particularly the 30% of the
MSY euchromatin (including the eight palindromes) exhibiting
intrachromosomal similarities of $99.9%. Large amplicons like
those described here are not unique to the MSY, but as in the MSY,
they have proven to be formidable obstacles to whole-genome
methods38,39. The iterative mapping and sequencing strategy used
here should be considered by genome scientists wishing to deter-
mine the structure and sequence of amplicon-rich regions of human
autosomes, the X chromosome and other genomes.
The medical relevance of the MSY
Propelled by advances in MSY genomics, the biomedical signiﬁ-
cance of the MSY has begun to surface in recent years, with evidence
of roles in such diverse processes as gonadal sex determination,
skeletal growth, germ-cell tumorigenesis and graft rejection6. Two
research areas that should beneﬁt from the present MSY sequence
and gene catalogue are of particular note. First, one of the most
common chromosomal disorders of girls and women is Turner
syndrome, classically associated with a 45,X (X0) karyotype. Haplo-
insufﬁciency of particular genes common to the X and Y chromo-
somes may be responsible for somatic features of the syndrome40–42.
In most cases, the molecular identity of these Turner genes remains
to be determined. One or more Turner genes are likely to be found
within the catalogue of X-degenerate genes (and their X-linked
homologues; see Table 2).
A highly active area of MSY research explores spermatogenesis
and the genetic basis of male infertility. MSYdeletions have emerged
as the most common of the known genetic causes of spermatogenic
failure in human populations13,43–46. The availability of MSY
sequence has already begun to transform our understanding,
enabling investigators to precisely deﬁne four distinct classes of
recurrent MSYdeletions causing spermatogenic failure, identify the
MSY genes absent as a result of these deletions (typically members
of testis-speciﬁc families), and demonstrate that most such
deletions are the result of homologous recombination between
near-identical amplicons13,43–46. Thus, the ampliconic structures
that may help preserve testis gene function across evolutionary
time (through gene conversion) also put individuals at risk of
spermatogenic failure (again, through homologous recombina-
tion).
Genetic and biological differences between males and females
It is commonly stated that the genomes of two randomly selected
members of our species exhibit 99.9% nucleotide identity. In reality,
this statement holds only if one is comparing two males, or two
females. If one compares a female with a male, the second X
chromosome (160 Mb, or roughly 3% of the diploid DNA content)
is replaced by the largely dissimilar Y chromosome (60 Mb, or 1% of
the diploid DNA content). This common substitution of the Y
chromosome for the second X chromosome dwarfs all other DNA
polymorphism in the human genome. In decades past, and with the
important exception of X-linked recessive diseases, biologists often
judged this genomic dimorphism to be of limited functional
consequence, especially because of inactivation of the second X
chromosome in females and the presumed paucity of genes in the Y
chromosome. Now we must begin to reconsider this position, given
the unanticipated number and variety of MSY genes, many of which
are expressed throughout the body, and the fact that many X-linked
genes are expressed from both X chromosomes in female cells47. The
present sequence of the MSY, and the emerging sequence of the X
chromosome, offer the near prospect of a comprehensive catalogue
of genetic and sequence differences between human males and
females. Translating this knowledge into an understanding of the
myriad differences between the sexes in anatomy, physiology,
cognition, behaviour and disease susceptibility presents a monu-
mental challenge, but surely one of broad signiﬁcance and
interest.
A
Methods
Iterative mapping and sequencing
The method of iterative mapping and sequencing used here has been described10,13. All
MSY BACs selected for sequencing were isolated from the RPCI-11 library48, with the
exception of 11 clones (nine spanning the AZFa region12, and two used to narrow gaps10)
from the CITB and CITC libraries. We made frequent use of publicly available BAC-end
sequences as a source of markers during the ﬁnal stages of map construction49. Two gaps
were closed by long-range PCR; see Supplementary Fig. 11.
Unfortunately, no cell line is available from the donor of the RPCI-11 BAC library.
Thus, to conﬁrm the large-scale organization of MSY sequences reported here, we PCR-
ampliﬁed the inner and outer boundaries of all palindromes in ten men with genetically
diverse Y chromosomes (PCR primers in Supplementary Table 8). We sequenced all
resulting products. These experiments conﬁrmed that each palindrome boundary is
present in the great majority of human Y chromosomes.
Intrachromosomal sequence similarity
Analyses of intrachromosomal similarity were performed using custom Perl code. This
code used BLAST (http://blast.wustl.edu) to compare all 5-kb sequence segments, in 2-kb
steps, to the entire remainder of the MSY sequence.
Interspersed repeats
We electronically identiﬁed interspersed repeats with RepeatMasker (http://
repeatmasker.genome.washington.edu).
Homology to other chromosomes
To identify sequence similarities to other human chromosomes, we conducted BLAST
searches against GenBank databases with the sequence of each MSY clone. Interspersed
repeats and low-complexity regions were masked using RepeatMasker. To experimentally
verify the chromosomal origins of sequences similar to the MSY, we designed STSs from

those sequences and assayed them against the NIGMS human/rodent somatic cell hybrid
mapping panels 1 and 2 (NIGMS Human Genetic Cell Repository, http://
locus.umdnj.edu/nigms/maps/mapping.html).
Identiﬁcation of new genes and transcription units
We identiﬁed potential transcripts from three sources: (1) BLAST matches to cDNA
sequences (EST or full length). We pursued matches where the cDNA sequence showed
evidence of polyadenylation or splicing, or where there were multiple matching cDNA
sequences. (2) BLAST matches to fragments of putative MSY transcripts that had been
cloned by cDNA selection of testis cDNA against a ﬂow-sorted, genomic Y-chromosome
library19. (3) GenomeScan18 predictions in the NCBI annotation of Y-chromosome
contigs. We then tested for transcription by RT–PCR as previously described13.
Chromosomal FISH
One- or two-colour FISH to human chromosomes was performed as previously
described9.
Calculation of Ks and Ka
We calculated the numbers of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (Ks) and of
non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site (Ka) as follows. We used FASTA
(ftp://ftp.virginia.edu/pub/fasta) to align the pairs of coding sequences in Supplementary
Table 5. For non-transcribed MSY pseudogenes, we used FASTA to align the genomic
sequence of pseudogene exons to the corresponding transcribed coding sequence
(Supplementary Table 5 and File 3). Then, as is standard practice, insertions/deletions
were manually removed from the alignments. We calculated Ks and Ka for these
alignments using the diverge function in the Wisconsin Package (Version 10.2, Genetics
Computer Group).
