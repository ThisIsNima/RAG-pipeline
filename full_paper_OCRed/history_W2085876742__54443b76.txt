Abstract: Behavioral scientists routinely publish broad claims about human psychology and behavior in the world’s top journals based
on samples drawn entirely from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) societies. Researchers – often
implicitly – assume that either there is little variation across human populations, or that these “standard subjects” are as
representative of the species as any other population. Are these assumptions justiﬁed? Here, our review of the comparative
database from across the behavioral sciences suggests both that there is substantial variability in experimental results across
populations and that WEIRD subjects are particularly unusual compared with the rest of the species – frequent outliers. The
domains reviewed include visual perception, fairness, cooperation, spatial reasoning, categorization and inferential induction, moral
reasoning, reasoning styles, self-concepts and related motivations, and the heritability of IQ. The ﬁndings suggest that members of
WEIRD societies, including young children, are among the least representative populations one could ﬁnd for generalizing about
humans. Many of these ﬁndings involve domains that are associated with fundamental aspects of psychology, motivation, and
behavior – hence, there are no obvious a priori grounds for claiming that a particular behavioral phenomenon is universal based on
sampling from a single subpopulation. Overall, these empirical patterns suggests that we need to be less cavalier in addressing
questions of human nature on the basis of data drawn from this particularly thin, and rather unusual, slice of humanity. We close
by proposing ways to structurally re-organize the behavioral sciences to best tackle these challenges.

1. Introduction
In the tropical forests of New Guinea, the Etoro believe
that for a boy to achieve manhood he must ingest the
semen of his elders. This is accomplished through ritua-
lized rites of passage that require young male initiates to
fellate a senior member (Herdt 1984/1993; Kelley 1980).
In contrast, the nearby Kaluli maintain that male initiation
is only properly done by ritually delivering the semen
through the initiate’s anus, not his mouth. The Etoro
revile these Kaluli practices, ﬁnding them disgusting. To
become a man in these societies, and eventually take a
wife, every boy undergoes these initiations. Such boy-inse-
minating practices, which are enmeshed in rich systems of
meaning and imbued with local cultural values, were not
uncommon among the traditional societies of Melanesia
and Aboriginal Australia (Herdt 1984/1993), as well as
in Ancient Greece and Tokugawa Japan.
Such in-depth studies of seemingly “exotic” societies,
historically the province of anthropology, are crucial for
understanding human behavioral and psychological vari-
ation. However, this target article is not about these
peoples. It is about a truly unusual group: people from
Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic
(WEIRD)1 societies. In particular, it is about the Western,
and more speciﬁcally American, undergraduates who form
the bulk of the database in the experimental branches of
psychology, cognitive science, and economics, as well as
allied ﬁelds (hereafter collectively labeled the “behavioral
sciences”). Given that scientiﬁc knowledge about human
psychology is largely based on ﬁndings from this subpopu-
lation, we ask just how representative are these typical
subjects in light of the available comparative database.
How justiﬁed are researchers in assuming a species-level
generality for their ﬁndings? Here, we review the evidence
regarding how WEIRD people compare with other
populations.
We pursued this question by constructing an empirical
review of studies involving large-scale comparative exper-
imentation on important psychological or behavioral
variables. Although such larger-scale studies are highly
informative, they are rather rare, especially when com-
pared to the frequency of species-generalizing claims.
When such comparative projects were absent, we relied
on large assemblies of studies comparing two or three
populations, and, when available, on meta-analyses.

Of course, researchers do not implicitly assume psycho-
logical or motivational universality with everything they
study. The present review does not address those phenom-
ena assessed by individual difference measures for which
the guiding assumption is variability among populations.
Phenomena such as personal values, emotional expressive-
ness, and personality traits are expected a priori to vary
across individuals, and by extension, societies. Indeed,
the goal of much research on these topics is to identify
the ways that people and societies differ from one
another. For example, a number of large projects have
sought to map out the world on dimensions such as
values (Hofstede 2001; Inglehart et al. 1998; Schwartz &
Bilsky 1990), personality traits (e.g., McCrae et al. 2005;
Schmitt et al. 2007), and levels of happiness, (e.g.,
Diener et al. 1995). Similarly, we avoid the vast psycho-
pathology literature, which ﬁnds much evidence for both
variability and universality in psychological pathologies
(Kleinman 1988; Tseng 2001), because this work focuses
on individual-level (and unusual) variations in psychologi-
cal functioning. Instead, we restrict our exploration to
those domains which have largely been assumed, at least
until recently, to be de facto psychological universals.
Finally, we also do not address societal-level behavioral
universals, or claims thereof, related to phenomena such
as dancing, ﬁre making, cooking, kinship systems, body
adornment, play, trade, and grammar, for two reasons.
First, at this surface level alone, such phenomena do not
make speciﬁc claims about universal underlying psycho-
logical or motivational processes. Second, systematic,
quantitative, comparative data based on individual-level
measures are typically lacking for these domains.
Our examination of the representativeness of WEIRD
subjects is necessarily restricted to the rather limited data-
base currently available. We have organized our presen-
tation into a series of telescoping contrasts showing, at
each level of contrast, how WEIRD people measure up
relative to the available reference populations. Our ﬁrst
contrast compares people from modern industrialized
societies with those from small-scale societies. Our
second telescoping stage contrasts people from Western
societies with those from non-Western industrialized
societies. Next, we contrast Americans with people from
other Western societies. Finally, we contrast university-
educated Americans with non–university-educated Amer-
icans, or university students with non-student adults,
depending on the available data. At each level we
discuss behavioral and psychological phenomena for
which there are available comparative data, and we
assess how WEIRD people compare with other samples.
We emphasize that our presentation of telescoping con-
trasts is only a rhetorical approach guided by the nature of
the available data. It should not be taken as capturing any
unidimensional continuum, or suggesting any single theor-
etical explanation for the variation. Throughout this article
we take no position regarding the substantive origins of the
observed differences between populations. While many of
the differences are probably cultural in nature in that they
were socially transmitted (Boyd & Richerson 1985;
Nisbett et al. 2001), other differences are likely environ-
mental and represent some form of non-cultural phenoty-
pic plasticity, which may be developmental or facultative,
as well as either adaptive or maladaptive (Gangestad et al.
2006; Tooby & Cosmides 1992). Other population differ-
ences could arise from genetic variation, as observed for
lactose processing (Beja-Pereira et al. 2003). Regardless
of the reasons underlying these population differences,
our concern is whether researchers can reasonably gener-
alize from WEIRD samples to humanity at large.
Many radical versions of interpretivism and cultural
relativity deny any shared commonalities in human psy-
chologies across populations (e.g., Gergen 1973; see cri-
tique and discussion in Slingerland 2008, Ch. 2). To the
contrary, we expect humans from all societies to share,
and probably share substantially, basic aspects of cogni-
tion, motivation, and behavior. As researchers who see
great value in applying evolutionary thinking to psychology
and behavior, we have little doubt that if a full accounting
were taken across all domains among peoples past and
present, the number of similarities would indeed be
large, as much ethnographic work suggests (e.g., Brown
1991) – ultimately, of course, this is an empirical question.
Thus, our thesis is not that humans share few basic psycho-
logical properties or processes; rather, we question our
current ability to distinguish these reliably developing

aspects of human psychology from more developmentally,
culturally,
or
environmentally
contingent
aspects
of
our psychology given the disproportionate reliance on
WEIRD subjects. Our aim here, then, is to inspire
efforts to place knowledge of such universal features of
psychology on a ﬁrmer footing by empirically addressing,
rather than a priori dismissing or ignoring, questions of
population variability.
2. Background
Before commencing with our telescoping contrasts, we
ﬁrst discuss two observations regarding the existing litera-
ture: (1) The database in the behavioral sciences is drawn
from an extremely narrow slice of human diversity; and (2)
behavioral scientists routinely assume, at least implicitly,
that their ﬁndings from this narrow slice generalize to
the species.
2.1. The behavioral sciences database is narrow
Who are the people studied in behavioral science
research? A recent analysis of the top journals in six sub-
disciplines of psychology from 2003 to 2007 revealed
that 68% of subjects came from the United States, and
a full 96% of subjects were from Western industriali-
zed countries, speciﬁcally those in North America and
Europe, as well as Australia and Israel (Arnett 2008).
The make-up of these samples appears to largely reﬂect
the country of residence of the authors, as 73% of ﬁrst
authors were at American universities, and 99% were at
universities in Western countries. This means that 96%
of psychological samples come from countries with only
12% of the world’s population.
Even within the West, however, the typical sampling
method for experimental studies is far from representa-
tive. In the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,
the premier journal in social psychology – the subdisci-
pline of psychology that should (arguably) be the most
attentive to questions about the subjects’ backgrounds –
67% of the American samples (and 80% of the samples
from other countries) were composed solely of under-
graduates in psychology courses (Arnett 2008). In other
words, a randomly selected American undergraduate is
more than 4,000 times more likely to be a research partici-
pant than is a randomly selected person from outside of
the West. Furthermore, this tendency to rely on under-
graduate samples has not decreased over time (Peterson
2001; Wintre et al. 2001). Such studies are therefore
sampling from a rather limited subpopulation within
each country (see Rozin 2001).
It is possible that the dominance of American authors in
psychology publications just reﬂects that American univer-
sities have the resources to attract the best international
researchers, and that similar tendencies exist in other
ﬁelds. However, psychology is a distinct outlier here:
70% of all psychology citations come from the United
States – a larger percentage than any of the other 19
sciences that were compared in one extensive inter-
national survey (see May 1997). In chemistry, by contrast,
the percentage of citations that come from the United
States is only 37%. It seems problematic that the discipline
in which there are the strongest theoretical reasons to
anticipate population-level variation is precisely the disci-
pline in which the American bias for research is most
extreme.
Beyond psychology and cognitive science, the subject
pools of experimental economics and decision science
are not much more diverse – still largely dominated by
Westerners, and speciﬁcally Western undergraduates.
However, to give credit where it is due, the nascent ﬁeld
of experimental economics has begun taking steps to
address the problem of narrow samples.2
In sum, the available database does not reﬂect the full
breadth of human diversity. Rather, we have largely
been studying the nature of WEIRD people, a certainly
narrow and potentially peculiar subpopulation.
2.2. Researchers often assume their ﬁndings are
universal
Sampling from a thin slice of humanity would be less pro-
blematic if researchers conﬁned their interpretations to
the populations from which they sampled. However,
despite their narrow samples, behavioral scientists often
are interested in drawing inferences about the human
mind and human behavior. This inferential step is rarely
challenged
or
defended – with
important
exceptions
(e.g., Medin & Atran 2004; Rozin 2001; Triandis 1994;
Witkin & Berry 1975) – despite the lack of any general
effort to assess how well results from WEIRD samples
generalize to the species. This lack of epistemic vigilance
underscores the prevalent, though implicit, assumption
that the ﬁndings one derives from a particular sample
will generalize broadly; one adult human sample is
pretty much the same as the next.
Leading scientiﬁc journals and university textbooks rou-
tinely publish research ﬁndings claiming to generalize to
“humans” or “people” based on research done entirely
with WEIRD undergraduates. In top journals such as
Nature and Science, researchers frequently extend their
ﬁndings from undergraduates to the species – often
declaring this generalization in their titles. These contri-
butions typically lack even a cautionary footnote about
these inferential extensions.
In psychology, much of this generalization is implicit. A
typical article does not claim to be discussing “humans”
but will rather simply describe a decision bias, psychologi-
cal process, set of correlations, and so on, without addres-
sing issues of generalizability, although ﬁndings are often
linked to “people.” Commonly, there is no demographic
information about the participants, aside from their age
and gender. In recent years there is a trend to qualify
some ﬁndings with disclaimers such as “at least within
Western culture,” though there remains a robust tendency
to generalize to the species. Arnett (2008) notes that psy-
chologists would surely bristle if journals were renamed
to more accurately reﬂect the nature of their samples
(e.g., Journal of Personality and Social Psychology of
American Undergraduate Psychology Students). They
would bristle, presumably, because they believe that
their ﬁndings generalize much beyond this sample. Of
course, there are important exceptions to this general
tendency, as some researchers have assembled a broad
database to provide evidence for universality (Buss

1989; Daly & Wilson 1988; Ekman 1999b; Elfenbein &
Ambady 2002; Kenrick & Keefe 1992a; Tracy & Matsu-
moto 2008).
When is it safe to generalize from a narrow sample to
the species? First, if one had good empirical reasons to
believe that little variability existed across diverse popu-
lations in a particular domain, it would be reasonable to
tentatively infer universal processes from a single sub-
population. Second, one could make an argument that as
long as one’s samples were drawn from near the center
of the human distribution, then it would not be overly pro-
blematic to generalize across the distribution more
broadly – at least the inferred pattern would be in the
vicinity of the central tendency of our species. In the
following, with these assumptions in mind, we review
the evidence for the representativeness of ﬁndings from
WEIRD people.
3. Contrast 1: Industrialized societies versus
small-scale societies
Our theoretical perspective, which is informed by evol-
utionary thinking, leads us to suspect that many aspects
of
people’s
psychological
repertoire
are
universal.
However, the current empirical foundations for our suspi-
cions are rather weak because the database of comparative
studies that include small-scale societies is scant, despite
the obvious importance of such societies in understanding
both the evolutionary history of our species and the poten-
tial impact of diverse environments on our psychology.
Here we ﬁrst discuss the evidence for differences
between populations drawn from industrialized and
small-scale societies in some seemingly basic psychological
domains, and follow this with research indicating universal
patterns across this divide.
3.1. Visual perception
Many readers may suspect that tasks involving “low-level”
or “basic” cognitive processes such as vision will not
vary much across the human spectrum (Fodor 1983).
However, in the 1960s an interdisciplinary team of anthro-
pologists and psychologists systematically gathered data
on the susceptibility of both children and adults from a
wide range of human societies to ﬁve “standard illusions”
(Segall et al. 1966). Here we highlight the comparative
ﬁndings on the famed Mu¨ller-Lyer illusion, because of
this illusion’s importance in textbooks, and its prominent
role as Fodor’s indisputable example of “cognitive impen-
etrability” in debates about the modularity of cognition
(McCauley & Henrich 2006). Note, however, that popu-
lation-level variability in illusion susceptibility is not
limited to the Mu¨ller-Lyer illusion; it was also found for
the Sander-Parallelogram and both Horizontal-Vertical
illusions.
Segall et al. (1966) manipulated the length of the two
lines in the Mu¨ller-Lyer illusion (Fig. 1) and estimated
the magnitude of the illusion by determining the approxi-
mate point at which the two lines were perceived as being
of the same length. Figure 2 shows the results from 16
societies, including 14 small-scale societies. The vertical
axis gives the “point of subjective equality” (PSE), which
measures the extent to which segment “a” must be
longer than segment “b” before the two segments are
judged equal in length. PSE measures the strength of
the illusion.
The
results
show
substantial
differences
among
populations, with American undergraduates anchoring
the extreme end of the distribution, followed by the
South African-European sample from Johannesburg. On
average, the undergraduates required that line “a” be
about a ﬁfth longer than line “b” before the two segments
were perceived as equal. At the other end, the San foragers
of the Kalahari were unaffected by the so-called illusion (it
is not an illusion for them). While the San’s PSE value
cannot be distinguished from zero, the American under-
graduates’ PSE value is signiﬁcantly different from all
the other societies studied.
As discussed by Segall et al., these ﬁndings suggest that
visual exposure during ontogeny to factors such as the
“carpentered corners” of modern environments may
favor certain optical calibrations and visual habits that
create and perpetuate this illusion. That is, the visual
system ontogenetically adapts to the presence of recurrent
features in the local visual environment. Because elements
such as carpentered corners are products of particular cul-
tural evolutionary trajectories, and were not part of most
environments for most of human history, the Mu¨ller-
Lyer illusion is a kind of culturally evolved by-product
(Henrich 2008).
These ﬁndings highlight three important consider-
ations. First, this work suggests that even a process as
apparently basic as visual perception can show substantial
variation across populations. If visual perception can
vary, what kind of psychological processes can we be
Figure 1.
The Mu¨ller-Lyer illusion. The lines labeled “a” and
“b” are the same length. Many subjects perceive line “b” as
longer than line “a”.
Figure 2.
Mu¨ller-Lyer results for Segall et al.’s (1966) cross-
cultural project. PSE (point of subjective equality) is the
percentage that segment a must be longer than b before
subjects perceived the segments as equal in length. Children
were sampled in the 5-to-11 age range.

sure will not vary? It is not merely that the strength of the
illusory effect varies across populations – the effect cannot
be detected in two populations. Second, both American
undergraduates and children are at the extreme end of
the distribution, showing signiﬁcant differences from all
other populations studied; whereas, many of the other
populations cannot be distinguished from one another.
Since children already show large population-level differ-
ences, it is not obvious that developmental work can
substitute for research across diverse human populations.
Children likely have different developmental trajectories
in different societies. Finally, this provides an example
of how population-level variation can be useful for
illuminating the nature of a psychological process, which
would not be as evident in the absence of comparative
work.
3.2. Fairness and cooperation in economic
decision-making
By the mid-1990s, researchers were arguing that a set of
robust experimental ﬁndings from behavioral economics
were evidence for a set of evolved universal motivations
(Fehr & Ga¨chter 1998; Hoffman et al. 1998). Foremost
among these experiments, the Ultimatum Game provides
a pair of anonymous subjects with a sum of real money
for a one-shot interaction. One of the pair – the propo-
ser – can offer a portion of this sum to the second
subject, the responder. Responders must decide whether
to accept or reject the offer. If a responder accepts, she
gets the amount of the offer and the proposer takes the
remainder; if she rejects, both players get zero. If subjects
are motivated purely by self-interest, responders should
always accept any positive offer; knowing this, a self-
interested proposer should offer the smallest non-zero
amount. Among subjects from industrialized populations –
mostly undergraduates from the United States, Europe,
and Asia – proposers typically offer an amount between
40% and 50% of the total, with a modal offer of
50% (Camerer 2003). Offers below about 30% are often
rejected.
With this seemingly robust empirical ﬁnding in their
sights, Nowak et al. (2000) constructed an evolutionary
analysis of the Ultimatum Game. When they modeled
the Ultimatum Game exactly as played, they did not get
results matching the undergraduate ﬁndings. However, if
they added reputational information, such that players
could know what their partners did with others on pre-
vious rounds of play, the analysis predicted offers and
rejections in the range of typical undergraduate responses.
They concluded that the Ultimatum Game reveals
humans’ species-speciﬁc evolved capacity for fair and
punishing behavior in situations with substantial reputa-
tional inﬂuence. But, since the Ultimatum Game is
typically played one-shot without reputational infor-
mation, Nowak et al. argued that people make fair
offers and reject unfair offers because their motivations
evolved in a world where such interactions were not
ﬁtness relevant – thus, we are not evolved to fully incor-
porate the possibility of non-reputational action in our
decision-making, at least in such artiﬁcial experimental
contexts.
Recent comparative work has dramatically altered this
initial picture. Two uniﬁed projects (which we call Phase
1 and Phase 2) have deployed the Ultimatum Game and
other related experimental tools across thousands of sub-
jects randomly sampled from 23 small-scale human
societies, including foragers, horticulturalists, pastoralists,
and subsistence farmers, drawn from Africa, Amazonia,
Oceania, Siberia, and New Guinea (Henrich et al. 2005;
2006; 2010). Three different experimental measures
show that people in industrialized societies consistently
occupy the extreme end of the human distribution.
Notably, people in some of the smallest-scale societies,
where real life is principally face-to-face, behaved in a
manner reminiscent of Nowak et al.’s analysis before
they added the reputational information. That is, these
populations made low offers and did not reject.
To concisely present these diverse empirical ﬁndings,
we show results only from the Ultimatum and Dictator
Games in Phase II. The Dictator Game is the same as
the Ultimatum Game except that the second player
cannot reject the offer. If subjects are motivated purely
by self-interest, they would offer zero in the Dictator
Game. Thus, Dictator Game offers yield a measure of
“fairness”
(equal
divisions)
among
two
anonymous
people. By contrast, Ultimatum Game offers yield a
measure of fairness combined with an assessment of the
likelihood of rejection (punishment). Rejections of offers
in the Ultimatum Game provide a measure of people’s
willingness to punish unfairness.
Using aggregate measures, Figure 3 shows that the be-
havior of the U.S. adult (non-student) sample occupies the
extreme end of the distribution in each case. For Dictator
Game offers, Figure 3A shows that the U.S. sample has the
highest mean offer, followed by the Sanquianga from
Colombia, who are renowned for their prosociality
(Kraul 2008). The U.S. offers are nearly double that of
the Hadza, foragers from Tanzania, and the Tsimane,
forager-horticulturalists
from
the
Bolivian
Amazon.
Figure 3B shows that for Ultimatum Game offers, the
United States has the second highest mean offer, behind
the Sursurunga from Papua New Guinea. On the punish-
ment side in the Ultimatum Game, Figure 3C shows the
income-maximizing offers (IMO) for each population,
which is a measure of the population’s willingness to
punish inequitable offers. IMO is the offer that an
income-maximizing proposer would make if he knew the
probability of rejection for each of the possible offer
amounts. The U.S. sample is tied with the Sursurunga.
These two groups have an IMO ﬁve times higher
than 70% of the other societies. While none of these
measures
indicates
that
people
from
industrialized
societies are entirely unique vis-a`-vis other populations,
they do show that people from industrialized societies
consistently occupy the extreme end of the human
distribution.
Analyses of these data show that a population’s degree
of market integration and its participation in a world reli-
gion both independently predict higher offers, and
account for much of the variation between populations.
Community size positively predicts greater punishment
(Henrich et al. 2010). The authors suggest that norms
and institutions for exchange in ephemeral interactions
culturally coevolved with markets and expanding larger-
scale sedentary populations. In some cases, at least in
their most efﬁcient forms, neither markets nor large popu-
lations were feasible before such norms and institutions

emerged. That is, it may be that what behavioral econom-
ists have been measuring among undergraduates in such
games is a speciﬁc set of social norms, culturally evolved
for dealing with money and strangers, that have emerged
since the origins of agriculture and the rise of complex
societies.
In addition to differences in populations’ willingness to
reject offers that are too low, the evidence also indicates a

willingness to reject offers that are too high in about half
the societies studied. This tendency to reject so-called
hyper-fair offers rises as offers increase from 60% to
100% of the stake (Henrich et al. 2006). This phenom-
enon, which is not observed in typical undergraduate sub-
jects (who essentially never reject offers greater than half),
has now emerged among populations in Russia (Bahry &
Wilson 2006) and China (Hennig-Schmidt et al. 2008),
as well as (to a lesser degree) among non-student adults
in Sweden (Wallace et al. 2007), Germany (Guth et al.
2003), and the Netherlands (Bellemare et al. 2008).
Attempts to explain away this phenomenon as a conse-
quence of confusion or misunderstanding, have not
found support despite substantial efforts.
Suppose that Nowak and his coauthors were Tsimane,
and that the numerous empirical ﬁndings they had on
hand were all from Tsimane villages. If this were the
case, presumably these researchers would have simulated
the Ultimatum Game and found that there was no need to
add reputation to their model. This unadorned evolution-
ary solution would have worked ﬁne until they realized
that the Tsimane are not representative of humanity.
According to the above data, the Tsimane are about as
representative of the species as are Americans, but at
the opposite end of the spectrum. If the database of the
behavioral sciences consisted entirely of Tsimane subjects,
researchers would likely be quite concerned about
generalizability.
3.3. Folkbiological reasoning
Recent work in small-scale societies suggests that some of
the central conclusions regarding the development and
operation of human folkbiological categorization, reason-
ing, and induction are limited to urban subpopulations
of non-experts in industrialized societies. Although much
more work needs to be done, it appears that typical sub-
jects (children of WEIRD parents) develop their folk-
biological reasoning in a culturally and experientially
impoverished environment, by contrast to those of small-
scale societies (and of our evolutionary past), distorting
both the species-typical pattern of cognitive development
and the patterns of reasoning in WEIRD adults.
Cognitive scientists using (as subjects) children drawn
from U.S. urban centers – often those surrounding uni-
versities – have constructed an inﬂuential, though actively
debated, developmental theory in which folkbiological
reasoning emerges from folkpsychological reasoning.
Before age 7, urban children reason about biological
phenomena by analogy to, and by extension from,
humans.
Between
ages
7
and
10,
urban
children
undergo a conceptual shift to the adult pattern of
viewing humans as one animal among many. These con-
clusions are underpinned by three robust ﬁndings from
urban children: (1) Inferential projections of properties
from humans are stronger than projections from other
living kinds; (2) inferences from humans to mammals
emerge as stronger than inferences from mammals to
humans; and (3) children’s inferences violate their own
similarity judgments by, for example, providing stronger
inference from humans to bugs than from bugs to bees
(Carey 1985; 1995).
However, when the folkbiological reasoning of children
in rural Native American communities in Wisconsin and
Yukatek Maya communities in Mexico was investigated
(Atran et al. 2001; Ross et al. 2003; Waxman & Medin
2007) none of these three empirical patterns emerged.
Among the American urban children, the human category
appears to be incorporated into folkbiological induction
relatively late compared to these other populations. The
results indicate that some background knowledge of the
relevant species is crucial for the application and induction
across a hierarchical taxonomy (Atran et al. 2001). In rural
environments, both exposure to and interest in the natural
world is commonplace, unavoidable, and an inevitable part
of the enculturation process. This suggests that the anthro-
pocentric patterns seen in U.S. urban children result from
insufﬁcient cultural input and a lack of exposure to the
natural world. The only real animal that most urban chil-
dren know much about is Homo sapiens, so it is not sur-
prising that this species dominates their inferential
patterns. Since such urban environments are highly “unna-
tural” from the perspective of human evolutionary history,
any conclusions drawn from subjects reared in such infor-
mationally
impoverished
environments
must
remain
rather tentative. Indeed, studying the cognitive develop-
ment of folkbiology in urban children would seem the
equivalent of studying “normal” physical growth in mal-
nourished children.
This deﬁciency of input likely underpins the fact that
the basic-level folkbiological categories for WEIRD
adults are life-form categories (e.g., bird, ﬁsh, and
mammal), and these are also the ﬁrst categories learned
by WEIRD children – for example, if one says “What’s
that?” (pointing at a maple tree), their common answer
is “tree.” However, in all small-scale societies studied,
the generic species (e.g., maple, crow, trout, and fox) is
the basic-level category and the ﬁrst learned by children
(Atran 1993; Berlin 1992).
Impoverished interactions with the natural world
may also distort assessments of the typicality of natural
kinds in categorization. The standard conclusion from
American undergraduate samples has been that goodness
of example, or typicality, is driven by similarity relations.
A robin is a typical bird because this species shares
many of the perceptual features that are commonly
found in the category BIRD. In the absence of close
familiarity with natural kinds, this is the default strategy
of
American
undergraduates,
and
psychology
has
assumed it is the universal pattern. However, in samples
which interact with the natural world regularly, such as
Itza Maya villagers, typicality is based not on similarity
but on knowledge of cultural ideals, reﬂecting the
symbolic or material signiﬁcance of the species in that
culture. For the Itza, the wild turkey is a typical bird
because of its rich cultural signiﬁcance, even though it is
in no way most similar to other birds. The same pattern
holds for similarity effects in inductive reasoning –
WEIRD people make strong inferences from compu-
tations of similarity, whereas populations with greater
familiarity with the natural world, despite their capacity
for similarity-based inductions, prefer to make strong
inferences from folkbiological knowledge that takes into
account
ecological
context
and
relationships
among
species (Atran et al. 2005). In general, research suggests
that what people think about can affect how they think
(Bang et al. 2007). To the extent that there is popu-
lation-level variability in the content of folkbiological
Henrich et al.: The weirdest people in the world?
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:2/3
7

----- Page 8 (native) -----
beliefs, such variability affects cognitive processing in this
domain as well.
So far we have emphasized differences in folkbiological
cognition uncovered by comparative research. This same
work has also uncovered reliably developing aspects of
human folkbiological cognition that do not vary, such as
categorizing plants and animals in a hierarchical taxonomy,
or that the generic species level has the strongest inductive
potential, despite the fact that this level is not always the
basic level across populations, as discussed above. Our
goal in emphasizing the differences here is to show (1)
how peculiar industrialized (urban, in this case) samples
are, given the unprecedented environment they grow up
in; and (2) how difﬁcult it is to conclude a priori what
aspects will be reliably developing and robust across
diverse slices of humanity if research is largely conducted
with WEIRD samples.
3.4. Spatial cognition
Human societies vary in their linguistic tools for, and cul-
tural practices associated with, representing and commu-
nicating (1) directions in physical space, (2) the color
spectrum, and (3) integer amounts. There is some evi-
dence that each of these differences in cultural content
may inﬂuence some aspects of nonlinguistic cognitive
processes (D’Andrade 1995; Gordon 2004; Kay 2005;
Levinson 2003; Roberson et al. 2000). Here we focus on
spatial cognition, for which the evidence is most provoca-
tive. As above, it appears that industrialized societies are at
the extreme end of the continuum in spatial cognition.
Human populations show differences in how they think
about spatial orientation and deal with directions, and
these differences may be inﬂuenced by linguistically
based spatial reference systems.
Speakers
of
English
and
other
Indo-European
languages favor the use of an egocentric (relative) system
to represent the location of objects – that is, relative to
the self (e.g., “the man is on the right side of the ﬂagpole”).
In contrast, many if not most languages favor an allocentric
frame, which comes in two ﬂavors. Some allocentric
languages
such
as
Guugu
Yimithirr
(an
Australian
language) and Tzeltal (a Mayan language) favor a geo-
centric system in which absolute reference is based on
cardinal directions (“the man is west of the house”). The
other allocentric frame is an object-centered (intrinsic)
approach that locates objects in space, relative to some
coordinate system anchored to the object (“the man is
behind the house”). When languages possess systems for
encoding all of these spatial reference frames, they often
privilege one at the expense of the others. However, the
fact that some languages lack one or more of the reference
systems suggests that the accretion of all three systems into
most contemporary languages may be a product of long-
term cumulative cultural evolution.
In data on spatial reference systems from 20 languages
drawn from diverse societies – including foragers, horti-
culturalists,
agriculturalists,
and
industrialized
popu-
lations – only
three
languages
relied
on
egocentric
frames as their single preferred system of reference. All
three were from industrialized populations: Japanese,
English, and Dutch (Majid et al. 2004).
The presence of, or emphasis on, different reference
systems may inﬂuence nonlinguistic spatial reasoning
(Levinson 2003). In one study, Dutch and Tzeltal speakers
were seated at a table and shown an arrow pointing either
to the right (north) or the left (south). They were then
rotated 180 degrees to a second table where they saw
two arrows: one pointing to the left (north) and the
other one pointing to the right (south). Participants were
asked which arrow on the second table was like the one
they saw before. Consistent with the spatial-marking
system of their languages, Dutch speakers chose the rela-
tive solution, whereas the Tzeltal speakers chose the absol-
ute solution. Several other comparative experiments
testing spatial memory and reasoning are consistent with
this pattern, although lively debates about interpretation
persist (Levinson et al. 2002; Li & Gleitman 2002).
Extending the above exploration, Haun and colleagues
(Haun et al. 2006a; 2006b) examined performance on a
spatial reasoning task similar to the one described above,
using children and adults from different societies and
great apes. In the ﬁrst step, Dutch-speaking adults and
8-year-olds (speakers of an egocentric language) showed
the typical egocentric bias, whereas Hai//om-speaking
adults and 8-year-olds (a Namibian foraging population
who speak an allocentric language) showed a typical allo-
centric bias. In the second step, 4-year-old German-speak-
ing children, gorillas, orangutans, chimpanzees, and
bonobos were tested on a simpliﬁed version of the same
task. All showed a marked preference for allocentric
reasoning. These results suggest that children share with
other great apes an innate preference for allocentric
spatial reasoning, but that this bias can be overridden by
input from language and cultural routines.
If one were to work on spatial cognition exclusively with
WEIRD subjects (say, using subjects from the United
States and Europe), one might conclude that children
start off with an allocentric bias but naturally shift to an
egocentric bias with maturation. The problem with this
conclusion is that it would not apply to many human
populations, and it may be the consequence of studying
subjects from peculiar cultural environments. The next
telescoping contrast highlights some additional evidence
suggesting that WEIRD people may even be unusual in
their egocentric bias vis-a`-vis most other industrialized
populations.
3.5. Other potential differences
We have discussed several lines of data suggesting not only
population-level variation, but that industrialized popu-
lations are consistently unusual compared to small-scale
societies. There are also numerous studies that have
found differences between much smaller numbers of
samples (usually two samples). In these studies it is
impossible to discern who is unusual, the small-scale
society or the WEIRD population. For example, one
study found that both samples from two different industri-
alized populations were risk-averse decision makers when
facing monetary gambles involving gains (Henrich &
McElreath 2002), whereas both samples from small-scale
societies were risk-prone. Risk-aversion for monetary
gains may be a recent, local phenomenon. Similarly, exten-
sive inter-temporal choice experiments using a panel
method of data collection indicates that the Tsimane,
an Amazonian population of forager-horticulturalists,
discount the future 10 times more steeply than do
Henrich et al.: The weirdest people in the world?
8
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:2/3

WEIRD people (Godoy et al. 2004). In Uganda, a study of
individual decision-making among small-scale farmers
showed qualitatively different deviations from expected
utility maximization than is typically found among under-
graduates. For example, rather than the inverse S-shape
for probabilities in Prospect Theory, a regular S-shape
was found.3
3.6. Similarities between industrialized and small-scale
societies
Some larger-scale comparative projects show universal
patterns in human psychology. Here we list some note-
worthy examples:
1. Some perceptual illusions: We discussed the Mu¨ller-
Lyer illusion above. However, there are illusions, such as
the Perspective Drawing Illusion, for which the industrial-
ized populations are not extreme outliers, and for which
perception varies little in the populations studied (Segall
et al. 1966).
2. Perceiving color: While the number of basic color
terms
systematically
varies
across
human
languages
(Regier et al. 2005), the ability to perceive different
colors does emerge
in small-scale
societies
(Rivers
1901a),4 although terms and categories do inﬂuence
color perception at the margins (Kay & Regier 2006).
3. Emotional expression: In studying facial displays of
emotions, Ekman and colleagues have shown much evi-
dence for universality in recognition of the “basic” facial
expressions of emotions, although this work has included
only a small – yet convincing – sampling of small-scale
societies (Ekman 1999a; 1999b). There is also evidence
for the universality of pride displays (Tracy & Matsumoto
2008; Tracy & Robins 2008). This main effect for emotion-
al recognition across population (58% of variance) is qua-
liﬁed by a smaller effect for cultural speciﬁcity of
emotional expressions (9% of variance: Elfenbein &
Ambady 2002).
4. False belief tasks: Comparative work in China, the
United States, Canada, Peru, India, Samoa, and Thailand
suggests that the ability to explicitly pass the false belief
task emerges in all populations studied (Callaghan et al.
2005; Liu et al. 2008), although the age at which subjects
can pass the explicit version of the false belief task varies
from 4 to at least 9 (Boesch 2007; Callaghan et al. 2005;
Liu et al. 2008), with industrialized populations at the
extreme low end.
5. Analog numeracy: There is growing consensus in the
literature on numerical thinking that quantity estimation
relies on a primitive “analog” number sense that is sensi-
tive to quantity but limited in accuracy. This cognitive
ability appears to be independent of counting practices
and was shown to operate in similar ways among two Ama-
zonian societies with very limited counting systems
(Gordon 2004; Pica et al. 2004), as well as in infants and
primates (e.g., Dehaene 1997).
6. Social relationships: Research on the cognitive pro-
cesses underlying social relationships reveals similar pat-
terns across distinct populations. Fiske (1993) studied
people’s tendency to confuse one person with another
(e.g., intending to phone your son Bob but accidentally
calling your son Fred). Chinese, Korean, Bengali, and
Vai (Liberia and Sierra Leone) immigrants tended to
confuse people in the same category of social relationship.
Interestingly, the social categories in which the most
confusion occurred varied across populations.
7. Psychological essentialism: Research from a variety
of societies, including Vezo children in Madagascar
(Astuti et al. 2004), children from impoverished neighbor-
hoods in Brazil (Sousa et al. 2002), Menominee in Wiscon-
sin (Waxman et al. 2007), and middle-class children and
adults in the United States (Gelman 2003), shows evidence
of perceiving living organisms as having an underlying and
non-trivial nature that makes them what they are. Psycho-
logical essentialism also extends to the understanding
of social groups, which may be found in Americans
(Gelman 2003), rural Ukranians (Kanovsky 2007), Vezo
in Madagascar (Astuti 2001), Mapuche farmers in Chile
(Henrich & Henrich, unpublished manuscript), Iraqi
Chaldeans and Hmong immigrants in Detroit (Henrich
& Henrich 2007), and Mongolian herdsmen (Gil-White
2001). Notably, this evidence is not well suited to examin-
ing differences in the degree of psychological essentialism
across populations, though it suggests that inter-popu-
lation variation may be substantial.
There are also numerous studies involving dyadic com-
parisons between a single small-scale society and a
Western population (or a pattern of Western results) in
which cross-population similarities have been found.
Examples are numerous but include the development of
an understanding of death (Barrett & Behne 2005),
shame (Fessler 2004),5 and cheater detection (Sugiyama
et al. 2002). Finding evidence for similarities across two
such disparate populations is an important step towards
providing
evidence
for
universality
(Norenzayan
&
Heine 2005); however, the case would be considerably
stronger if it was found across a larger number of
diverse populations.6
3.7. Summary for Contrast 1
Although there are several domains in which the data from
small-scale societies appear similar to that from industrial-
ized
societies,
comparative
projects
involving
visual
illusions, social motivations (fairness), folkbiological cogni-
tion, and spatial cognition all show industrialized popu-
lations as outliers. Given all this, it seems problematic to
generalize from industrialized populations to humans
more broadly, in the absence of supportive empirical
evidence.
4. Contrast 2: Western7 versus non-Western
societies
For our second contrast, we review evidence comparing
Western with non-Western populations. Here we examine
four of the most studied domains: social decision making
(fairness, cooperation, and punishment), independent
versus interdependent self-concepts (and associated motiv-
ations), analytic versus holistic reasoning, and moral reason-
ing. We also brieﬂy return to spatial cognition.
4.1. Anti-social punishment and cooperation
In the previous contrast, we reviewed social decision-
making experiments showing that industrialized popu-
lations
occupy
the
extreme
end
of
the
behavioral
Henrich et al.: The weirdest people in the world?

distribution vis-a`-vis a broad swath of smaller-scale
societies. Here we show that even among industrialized
populations,
Westerners
are
again
clumped
at
the
extreme end of the behavioral distribution. Notably, the
behaviors measured in the experiments discussed below
are strongly correlated with the strength of formal insti-
tutions, norms of civic cooperation, and Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) per capita.
In 2002, Fehr and Ga¨chter published their classic
paper, “Altruistic Punishment in Humans,” in Nature,
based on Public Goods Games with and without punish-
ment, conducted with undergraduates at the University
of Zurich. The paper demonstrated that adding the possi-
bility of punishment to a cooperative dilemma dramati-
cally altered the outcome, from a gradual slide towards
little cooperation (and rampant free-riding), to a steady
increase towards stable cooperation. Enough subjects
were willing to punish non-cooperators at a cost to them-
selves to shift the balance from free-riding to cooperation.
In stable groups this cooperation-punishment combi-
nation dramatically increases long-run gains (Ga¨chter
et al. 2008).
To examine the generalizability of these results, which
many took to be a feature of our species, Herrmann,
Thoni, and Ga¨chter conducted systematic comparable
experiments among undergraduates from a diverse swath
of industrialized populations (Herrmann et al. 2008). In
these Public Goods Games, subjects played with the
same four partners for 10 rounds and could contribute
during each round to a group project. All contributions
to the group project were multiplied by 1.6 and distributed
equally among all partners. Players could also pay to
punish other players by taking money away from them.
In addition to ﬁnding population-level differences in the
subjects’ initial willingness to cooperate, Ga¨chter’s team
unearthed in about half of these samples a phenomenon
that is not observed beyond a trivial degree among
typical undergraduate subjects (see our Fig. 4): Many sub-
jects engaged in anti-social punishment; that is, they paid
to reduce the earnings of “overly” cooperative individuals
(those who contributed more than the punisher did). The
effect of this behavior on levels of cooperation was
dramatic, completely compensating for the cooperation-
inducing effects of punishment in the Zurich experiment.
Possibilities for altruistic punishment do not generate high
levels of cooperation in these populations. Meanwhile,
participants from a number of Western countries, such
as the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia,
behaved like the original Zurich students. Thus, it
appears that the Zurich sample works well for generalizing
to the patterns of other Western samples (as well as the
Chinese sample), but such ﬁndings cannot be readily
extended beyond this.
4.2. Independent and interdependent self-concepts
Much psychological research has explored the nature of
people’s self-concepts. Self-concepts are important, as
they organize the information that people have about
themselves, direct attention to information that is per-
ceived to be relevant, shape motivations, inﬂuence how
people appraise situations that inﬂuence their emotional
experiences, and guide their choices of relationship part-
ners. Markus and Kitayama (1991) posited that self-
concepts can take on a continuum of forms stretching
between two poles, termed independent and interdepen-
dent self-views, which relate to the individualism-collecti-
vism construct (Triandis 1989; 1994). Do people conceive
of themselves primarily as self-contained individuals,
understanding themselves as autonomous agents who
consist largely of component parts, such as attitudes,
personality traits, and abilities? Or do they conceive of
themselves as interpersonal beings intertwined with
one another in social webs, with incumbent role-based
obligations towards others within those networks? The
extent to which people perceive themselves in ways
similar to these independent or interdependent poles
has signiﬁcant consequences for a variety of emotions,
cognitions, and motivations.
Much research has underscored how Westerners have
more independent views of self than non-Westerners.
For example, research using the Twenty Statements Test
(Kuhn & McPartland 1954) reveals that people from
Western populations (e.g., Australians, Americans, Cana-
dians, Swedes) are far more likely to understand their
selves in terms of internal psychological characteristics,
such as their personality traits and attitudes, and are less
likely to understand them in terms of roles and relation-
ships, than are people from non-Western populations,
such as Native Americans, Cook Islanders, Maasai and
Samburu (both African pastoralists), Malaysians, and
East Asians (for a review, see Heine 2008). Studies using
other measures (Hofstede 1980; Morling & Lamoreaux
Figure 4.
Mean punishment expenditures from each sample for

good. The deviations of the punished subject’s contribution
from

contribution
are
grouped
into
ﬁve
intervals, where [-20,-11] indicates that the punished subjects
contributed between 11 and 20 less than the punishing subject;
[0] indicates that the punished subject contributed exactly the
same amount as the punishing subject; and [1,10] ([11,20])
indicates that the punished subject contributed between 1 and
10 (11 and 20) more than the punishing subject. Adapted from

2008; Oyserman et al. 2002; Triandis et al. 1990) provide
convergent evidence that Westerners tend to have more
independent, and less interdependent, self-concepts than
those of other populations. These data converge with
much ethnographic observation, in particular Geertz’s
(1975, p. 48) claim that the Western self is “a rather peculiar
idea within the context of the world’s cultures.”
There are numerous psychological patterns associated
with self-concepts. For example, people with independent
self-concepts are more likely to demonstrate (1) positively
biased views of themselves; (2) a heightened valuation
of personal choice; and (3) an increased motivation to
“stand out” rather than to “ﬁt in.” Each of these represents
a signiﬁcant research enterprise, and we discuss them in
turn.
4.2.1. Positive self-views. The most widely endorsed
assumption regarding the self is that people are motivated
to view themselves positively. Roger Brown (1986)
famously declared this motivation to maintain high self-
esteem an “urge so deeply human, we can hardly
imagine its absence” (p. 534). The strength of this motiv-
ation has been perhaps most clearly documented by asses-
sing the ways that people go about exaggerating their
self-views by engaging in self-serving biases, in which
people view themselves more positively than objective
benchmarks would justify. For example, in one study,
94% of American professors rated themselves as better
than the average American professor (Cross 1977).
However, meta-analyses reveal that these self-serving
biases tend to be more pronounced in Western popu-
lations than in non-Western ones (Heine & Hamamura
2007; Mezulis et al. 2004) – for example, Mexicans
(Tropp & Wright 2003), Native Americans (Fryberg &
Markus 2003), Chileans (Heine & Raineri 2009), and
Fijians (Rennie & Dunne 1994) score much lower on
various measures of positive self-views than do Westerners
(although there are some exceptions to this general
pattern; see Harrington & Liu 2002). Indeed, in some cul-
tural contexts, most notably East Asian ones, evidence for
self-serving biases tends to be null, or in some cases, shows
signiﬁcant reversals, with East Asians demonstrating self-
effacing biases (Heine & Hamamura 2007). At best, the
sharp self-enhancing biases of Westerners are less pro-
nounced in much of the rest of the world, although self-
enhancement has long been discussed as if it were a fun-
damental aspect of human psychology (e.g., Rogers
1951; Tesser 1988).
4.2.2. Personal choice. Psychology has long been fasci-
nated with how people assert agency by making choices
(Bandura 1982; Kahneman & Tversky 2000; Schwartz
2004), and has explored the efforts that people go
through to ensure that their actions feel freely chosen
and that their choices are sensible. However, there is con-
siderable variation across populations in the extent to
which people value choice and in the range of behaviors
over which they feel that they are making choices. For
example, one study found that European-American chil-
dren preferred working on a task, worked on it longer,
and performed better on it, if they had made some super-
ﬁcial choices regarding the task than if others made
the same choices for them. In contrast, Asian-American
children were equally motivated by the task if a trusted
other made the same choices for them (Iyengar &
Lepper 1999). Another two sets of studies found that
Indians were slower at making choices, were less likely
to make choices consistent with their personal prefer-
ences, and were less likely to view their actions as
expressions of choice, than were Americans (Savani et al.
2008; in press). Likewise, the extent to which people feel
that they have much choice in their lives varies across
populations. Surveys conducted at bank branches in
Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, the Philippines, Singapore,
Taiwan, and the United States found that Americans
were more likely to perceive having more choice at their
jobs
than
were
subjects
from
the
other
countries
(Iyengar & DeVoe 2003). Another survey administered
in more than 40 countries found, in general, that feelings
of free choice in one’s life were considerably higher in
Western nations (e.g., Finland, the United States, and
Northern Ireland) than in various non-Western nations
(e.g., Turkey, Japan, and Belarus: Inglehart et al. 1998).
This research reveals that perceptions of choice are experi-
enced less often, and are a lesser concern, among those
from non-Western populations.
4.2.3.
Motivations
to
conform.
Many
studies
have
explored whether motivations to conform are similar
across populations by employing a standard experimental
procedure (Asch 1951; 1952). In these studies, which
were initially conducted with Americans, participants
ﬁrst hear a number of confederates making a perceptual
judgment that is obviously incorrect, and then participants
are given the opportunity to state their own judgment.
A majority of American participants were found to go
along with the majority’s incorrect judgment at least
once. This research sparked much interest, apparently
because Westerners typically feel that they are acting on
their own independent resolve and are not conforming.
A meta-analysis of studies performed in 17 societies
(Bond & Smith 1996), including subjects from Oceania,
the Middle East, South America, Africa, South America,
East Asia, Europe, and the United States, found that
motivations for conformity are weaker in Western societies
than elsewhere. Other research converges with this con-
clusion. For example, Kim and Markus (1999) found that
Koreans preferred objects that were more common,
whereas Americans showed a greater preference for
objects that were more unusual.
4.3. Analytic versus holistic reasoning
Variation in favored modes of reasoning has been com-
pared across several populations. Most of the research
has contrasted Western (American, Canadian, Western
European) with East Asian (Chinese, Japanese, Korean)
populations with regard to their relative reliance on what
is
known
as
“holistic”
versus
“analytic”
reasoning
(Nisbett 2003; Peng & Nisbett 1999). However, growing
evidence from other non-Western populations points to
a divide between Western nations and most everyone
else, including groups as diverse as Arabs, Malaysians,
and Russians (see Norenzayan et al. [2007] for a review),
as well as subsistence farmers in Africa and South
America and sedentary foragers (Norenzayan et al., n.d.;
Witkin & Berry 1975), rather than an East-West divide.
Henrich et al.: The weirdest people in the world?
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:2/3

----- Page 12 (native) -----
Holistic thought involves an orientation to the context or
ﬁeld as a whole, including attention to relationships
between a focal object and the ﬁeld, and a preference
for explaining and predicting events on the basis of such
relationships. Analytic thought involves a detachment of
objects from contexts, a tendency to focus on objects’ attri-
butes, and a preference for using categorical rules to
explain and predict behavior. This distinction between
habits of thought rests on a theoretical partition between
two reasoning systems. One system is associative, and its
computations
reﬂect
similarity
and
contiguity
(i.e.,
whether two stimuli share perceptual resemblances and
co-occur in time); the other system relies on abstract, sym-
bolic representational systems, and its computations
reﬂect a rule-based structure (e.g., Neisser 1963; Sloman
1996).
Although both cognitive systems are available in all
normal adults, different environments, experiences, and
cultural routines may encourage reliance on one system
at the expense of the other, giving rise to population-
level differences in the use of these different cognitive
strategies to solve identical problems. There is growing
evidence that a key factor inﬂuencing the prominence of
analytic versus holistic cognition is the different self-con-
struals prevalent across populations. First, independent
self-construal
primes
facilitate
analytic
processing,
whereas interdependent primes facilitate holistic proces-
sing
(Oyserman
&
Lee
2008).
Second,
geographic
regions with greater prevalence of interdependent self-
construals show more holistic processing, as can be seen
in comparisons of Northern and Southern Italians, Hok-
kaido and mainland Japanese, and Western and Eastern
Europeans (Varnum et al. 2008).
Furthermore, the analytic approach is culturally more
valued in Western contexts, whereas the holistic approach
is more valued in East Asian contexts, leading to normative
judgments about cognitive strategies that differ across the
respective populations (Buchtel & Norenzayan 2008).
Below we highlight some ﬁndings from this research
showing that, compared to diverse populations of non-
Westerners, Westerners (1) attend more to objects than
ﬁelds; (2) explain behavior in more decontextualized
terms; and (3) rely more on rules over similarity relations
to classify objects (for further discussion of the cross-cul-
tural evidence, see Nisbett 2003; Norenzayan et al. 2007).
1. Using evidence derived from the Rod & Frame Test
and Embedded Figures Test, Witkin and Berry (1975)
summarize a wide range of evidence from migratory and
sedentary foraging populations (Arctic, Australia, and
Africa),
sedentary
agriculturalists,
and
industrialized
Westerners. Only Westerners and migratory foragers
consistently emerged at the ﬁeld-independent end of
the spectrum. Recent work among East Asians (Ji et al.
2004) in industrialized societies using the Rod & Frame
Test, the Framed Line Test (Kitayama et al. 2003), and
the Embedded Figures Test again shows Westerners at
the ﬁeld-independent end of the spectrum, compared to
ﬁeld-dependent
East
Asians,
Malays,
and
Russians
(Kuhnen et al. 2001). Similarly, Norenzayan et al. (2007)
found that Canadians showed less ﬁeld-dependent proces-
sing than did Chinese, who in turn were less ﬁeld-depen-
dent than were Arabs (also see Zebian & Denny 2001).
2. East Asians’ recall for objects is worse than Ameri-
cans’ if the background has been switched (Masuda &
Nisbett 2001), indicating that East Asians are attending
more to the ﬁeld. This difference in attention has also
been found in saccadic eye-movements as measured
with eye-trackers. Americans gaze at focal objects longer
than East Asians, who in turn gaze at the background
more than Americans (Chua et al. 2005). Furthermore,
when performing identical cognitive tasks, East Asians
and Westerners show differential brain activation, corre-
sponding to the predicted cultural differences in cognitive
processing (Gutchess et al. 2006; Hedden et al. 2008).
3. Several classic studies, initially conducted with
Western participants, found that “people” tend to make
strong attributions about a person’s disposition, even
when there are compelling situational constraints (Jones
& Harris 1967; Ross et al. 1977). This tendency to
ignore situational information in favor of dispositional
information is so commonly observed – among typical
subjects – that it was dubbed the “fundamental attribu-
tion error” (Ross et al. 1977). However, consistent with
much ethnography in non-Western cultures (e.g., Geertz
1975),
comparative
experimental
work
demonstrates
differences that, while Americans attend to dispositions
at the expense of situations (Gilbert & Malone 1995),
East Asians are more likely than Americans to infer that
behaviors are strongly controlled by the situation (Miya-
moto & Kitayama 2002; Morris & Peng 1994; Norenzayan
et al. 2002a; Van Boven et al. 1999), particularly when
situational information is made salient (Choi & Nisbett
1998).8 Grossmann and Varnum (2010) provides parallel
ﬁndings with Russians. Likewise, in an investigation of
people’s lay beliefs about personality across eight popu-
lations, Church et al. (2006) found that people from
Western populations (i.e., American and Euro-Australian)
strongly endorsed the notion that traits remain stable over
time and predict behavior over many situations, whereas
people from non-Western populations (i.e., Asian-Austra-
lian, Chinese-Malaysian, Filipino, Japanese, Mexican, and
Malay) more strongly endorsed contextual beliefs about
personality, such as ideas suggesting that traits do not
describe a person as well as roles or duties do, and that
trait-related behavior changes from situation to situation.
These patterns are consistent with earlier work on attribu-
tions comparing Euro-Americans with Hindu Indians (see
Miller 1984; Shweder & Bourne 1982). Hence, although
dispositional inferences can be found outside the West,
the fundamental attribution error seems less fundamental
elsewhere (Choi et al. 1999).
4. Westerners are also more likely to rely on rules over
similarity
relations
in
reasoning
and
categorization.
Chinese subjects were found to be more likely to group
together objects which shared a functional (e.g., pencil-
notebook) or contextual (e.g., sky-sunshine) relationship,
whereas Americans were more likely to group objects
together if they belonged to a category deﬁned by a
simple rule (e.g., notebook-magazine; Ji et al. 2004). Simi-
larly, work with Russian students (Grossmann, 2010) and
Russian small-scale farmers (Luria 1976) showed strong
tendencies for participants to group objects according to
their practical functions. This appears widespread, as Nor-
enzayan et al. (n.d.) examined classiﬁcation among the
Mapuche and Sangu subsistence farmers in Chile and
Tanzania, respectively, and found that their classiﬁcation
resembled the Chinese pattern, although it was exagger-
ated towards holistic reasoning.

5. In a similar vein, research with East Asians found
they were more likely to group objects if the objects
shared a strong family resemblance, whereas Americans
were more likely to group the same objects if they could
be assigned to that group on the basis of a deterministic
rule (Norenzayan et al. 2002b). When those results are
compared with Uskul et al.’s (2008) ﬁndings from
herding, ﬁshing, and tea-farming communities on the
Black Sea coast in Turkey – the two studies used the
same stimuli – it is evident that European-Americans
are again at the extreme (see our Figure 5).
In summary, although analytic and holistic cognitive
systems are available to all normal adults, a large body
of evidence shows that the habitual use of what are
considered “basic” cognitive processes, including those
involved in attention, perception, categorization, deduc-
tive reasoning, and social inference, varies systematically
across populations in predictable ways, highlighting the
difference between the West and the rest. Several biases
and patterns are not merely differences in strength or
tendency, but show reversals of Western patterns. We
emphasize, however, that Westerners are not unique in
their cognitive styles (Uskul et al. 2008; Witkin & Berry
1975), but they do occupy the extreme end of the
distribution.
4.4. Moral reasoning
A central concern in the developmental literature has been
the way people acquire the cognitive foundations of moral
reasoning. The most inﬂuential approach to the develop-
ment of moral reasoning has been Kohlberg’s (1971;
1976; 1981), in which people’s abilities to reason morally
are seen to hinge on cognitive abilities that develop over
maturation. Kohlberg proposed that people progressed
through the same three levels: (1) Children start out at a
pre-conventional level, viewing right and wrong as based
on internal standards regarding the physical or hedonistic
consequences of actions; (2) then they progress to a
conventional level, where morality is based on external
standards, such as that which maintains the social order
of their group; and ﬁnally (3) some progress further to a
post-conventional level, where they no longer rely on
external standards for evaluating right and wrong, but
instead do so on the basis of abstract ethical principles
regarding justice and individual rights – the moral code
inherent in most Western constitutions.
While all of Kohlberg’s levels are commonly found in
WEIRD populations, much subsequent research has
revealed scant evidence for post-conventional moral
reasoning
in
other
populations.
One
meta-analysis
carried out with data from 27 countries found consistent
evidence for post-conventional moral reasoning in all the
Western urbanized samples, yet found no evidence for
this type of reasoning in small-scale societies (Snarey
1985). Furthermore, it is not just that formal education
is necessary to achieve Kohlberg’s post-conventional
level. Some highly educated non-Western populations do
not show this post-conventional reasoning. At Kuwait Uni-
versity, for example, faculty members scored lower on
Kohlberg’s schemes than the typical norms for Western
adults, and the elder faculty there scored no higher than
the younger ones, contrary to Western patterns (Al-
Shehab 2002; Miller et al. 1990).
Research in moral psychology indicates that typical
Western subjects rely principally on justice- and harm/
care-based principles in judging morality. However,
recent work indicates that non-Western adults and
Western religious conservatives rely on a wider range of
moral principles than these two dimensions of morality
(Baek 2002; Haidt & Graham 2007; Haidt et al. 1993;
e.g., Miller & Bersoff 1992). Shweder et al. (1997) pro-
posed that in addition to a dominant justice-based moral-
ity, which they termed an “ethic of autonomy,” there are
two other ethics that are commonly found outside the
West: an ethic of community, in which morality derives
from the fulﬁllment of interpersonal obligations that are
tied to an individual’s role within the social order, and
an ethic of divinity, in which people are perceived to be
bearers of something holy or god-like, and have moral
obligations to not act in ways that are degrading to or
incommensurate with that holiness. The ethic of divinity
requires that people treat their bodies as temples, not as
playgrounds, and so personal choices that seem to harm
nobody else (e.g., about food, sex, and hygiene) are some-
times moralized (for a further elaboration of moral
foundations, see Haidt & Graham 2007). In sum, the
high-socioeconomic status (SES), secular Western popu-
lations that have been the primary target of study thus
far, appear unusual in a global context, based on their
peculiarly narrow reliance, relative to the rest of humanity,
on a single foundation for moral reasoning (based on
justice, individual rights, and the avoidance of harm to
others; cf. Haidt & Graham 2007).
4.5. Other potential differences
There are many other psychological phenomena in which
Western samples differ from non-Western ones; however,
at present there are insufﬁcient data in these domains
derived from diverse populations to assess where Wester-
ners reside in the human spectrum. For example, com-
pared with Westerners, some non-Westerners (1) have
Figure 5.
Relative dominance of rule-based versus family
resemblance–based judgments of categories for the same
cognitive task. European-American, Asian-American, and East
Asian university students were tested by Norenzayan et al.
(2002b); the herders, ﬁshermen, and farmers of Turkey’s Black
Sea coast were tested by Uskul et al. (2008). Positive scores
indicate a relative bias towards rule-based judgments, whereas
negative
scores
indicate
a
relative
bias
towards
family
resemblance–based judgments. It can be seen that European-
American students show the most pronounced bias toward
rule-based judgments, and they are outliers in terms of
absolute deviation from zero. Adapted from Norenzayan et al.
(2002b) and Uskul et al. (2008).

less dynamic social networks, in which people work to
avoid negative interactions among their existing networks
rather than seeking new relations (Adams 2005); (2)
prefer lower to higher arousal-positive affective states
(Tsai 2007); (3) are less egocentric when they try to take
the perspective of others (Cohen et al. 2007; Wu &
Keysar 2007); (4) have weaker motivations for consistency
(Kanagawa et al. 2001; Suh 2002); (5) are less prone to
“social-loaﬁng” (i.e., reducing efforts on group tasks
when individual contributions are not being monitored)
(Earley
1993);
(6)
associate
fewer
beneﬁts
with
a
person’s physical attractiveness (Anderson et al. 2008);
and (7) have more pronounced motivations to avoid nega-
tive outcomes relative to their motivations to approach
positive outcomes (Elliot et al. 2001; Lee et al. 2000).
With reference to the spatial reasoning patterns discussed
earlier, emerging evidence suggests that a geocentric bias
(i.e., a landscape- or earth-ﬁxed spatial coordinate system)
may be much more widespread than previously thought –
indeed, it may be the common pattern outside of the
West, even among non-Western speakers of languages
which make regular use of egocentric linguistic markers.
Comparative research contrasting children and adults in
Geneva with samples in Indonesia, Nepal, and rural and
urban India have found the typical geocentric reasoning
pattern in all of these populations, except for the Geneva
samples (Dasen et al. 2006). Although many of these popu-
lation-level differences are pronounced, more research is
needed before we can assess whether the geocentric
pattern is common across a broader swath of humanity.
4.6. Similarities between Western and non-Western
societies
We expect that as more large-scale comparative studies of
Western and non-Western populations are conducted,
they will reveal substantial similarities in psychological pro-
cesses. However, given the relative ease of conducting such
studies (as compared to working in small-scale societies),
there have been few comparative programs that have put
universality claims to the test. Here we highlight three
examples of larger-scale comparative projects that show
broad and important similarities across populations.
1. Mate preferences: First, Buss (1989) compared
people
from
37
(largely
industrialized)
populations
around the world and found some striking similarities in
their mate preferences. In all 37 of the populations,
males ranked the physical attractiveness of their mates to
be more important than did females; and in 34 of the 37
populations, females ranked the ambition and industrious-
ness of their mates as more important than did males (but
for other interpretations, see Eagly & Wood 1999).9 Like-
wise, Kenrick and Keefe (1992a; 1992b) provide evidence
of robust differences in age preferences of mates across
populations. Finally, comparative research examining
men’s preferred waist-to-hip ratios in potential mates
ﬁnds that men in both industrialized and developing
large-scale populations prefer a waist-to-hip ratio of
around 0.7 (Singh 2006; Singh & Luis 1994; Streeter &
McBurney 2003; Swami et al. 2007).10
2. Personality structure: Recent efforts have taken per-
sonality instruments to university students in 51 different
countries (McCrae et al. 2005). In most of these popu-
lations, the same ﬁve-factor structure emerges that has
previously been found with American samples,11 indicating
the universal structure of the Five Factor Model of person-
ality (also see Allik & Mccrae 2004; Yik et al. 2002).12
3. Punishment of free-riding: While in Hermann et al.’s
(2008) study (Fig. 4) both initial cooperation and antisocial
punishment varied dramatically, the willingness of players
to punish low contributors (free-riders) was not different
among populations, once age, sex, and other socio-demo-
graphic controls are included.
4.7. Summary of Contrast 2
Although robust patterns have emerged among people
from industrialized societies, Westerners emerge as
unusual – frequent
global
outliers – on
several
key
dimensions. The experiments reviewed are numerous,
arise from different disciplines, use diverse methods, and
are often part of systematically comparable data sets
created by uniﬁed projects. Many of these differences
are not merely differences in the magnitude of effects
but often show qualitative differences, involving effect
reversals or novel phenomena such as allocentric spatial
reasoning and antisocial punishment.
5. Contrast 3: Contemporary Americans versus the
rest of the West
Above we compared WEIRD populations to non-Western
populations. However, given the dominance of American
research within psychology (see May 1997) and the behav-
ioral sciences, it is important to assess the similarity of Amer-
ican data with that from Westerners more generally. Is it
reasonable to generalize from Americans to the rest of the
West? Americans are, of course, people too, so they will
share many psychological characteristics with other Homo
sapiens. At present, we could ﬁnd no systematic research
program to compare Americans with other Westerners, so
the evidence presented is assembled from many sources.
5.1. Individualism and related psychological
phenomena
Americans stand out relative to other Westerners on
phenomena that are associated with independent self-
concepts and individualism. A number of analyses, using
a diverse range of methods, reveal that Americans are,
on average, the most individualistic people in the world
(e.g., Hofstede 1980; Lipset 1996; Morling & Lamoreaux
2008; Oyserman et al. 2002). The observation that the
United States is especially individualistic is not new and
dates at least as far back as de Toqueville (1835). The unu-
sually individualistic nature of Americans may be caused
by, or reﬂect, an ideology that particularly stresses the
importance of freedom and self-sufﬁciency, as well as
various practices in education and childrearing that may
help to inculcate this sense of autonomy. American
parents, for example, were the only ones in a survey of
100 societies who created a separate room for their baby
to sleep (Burton & Whiting 1961; also see Lewis 1995),
reﬂecting that from the time they are born, Americans
are raised in an environment that emphasizes their inde-
pendence (on the unusual nature of American childrear-
ing, see Lancy 2008; Rogoff 2003).13

The extreme individualism of Americans is evident on
many demographic and political measures. In American
Exceptionalism,
sociologist
Seymour
Martin
Lipset
(1996) documents a long list of the ways that Americans
are unique in the Western world. At the time of Lipset’s
surveys, compared with other Western industrialized
societies, Americans were found to be the most patriotic,
litigious, philanthropic, and populist (they have the most
positions for elections and the most frequent elections,
although they have among the lowest voter turnout
rates). They were also among the most optimistic, and
the least class-conscious. They were the most churchgoing
in Protestantism, and the most fundamentalist in Christen-
dom, and were more likely than others from Western
industrialized countries to see the world in absolute
moral terms. In contrast to other large Western industrial-
ized societies, the United States had the highest crime
rate, the longest working hours, the highest divorce rate,
the highest rate of volunteerism, the highest percentage
of citizens with a post-secondary education, the highest
productivity rate, the highest GDP, the highest poverty
rate, and the highest income-inequality rate; and Ameri-
cans were the least supportive of various governmental
interventions. The United States is the only industrialized
society that never had a viable socialist movement; it was
the last country to get a national pension plan, unemploy-
ment insurance, and accident insurance; and, at the time
of writing, remain the only industrialized nation that
does not have a general allowance for families or a national
health insurance plan. In sum, there is some reason to
suspect that Americans might be different from other
Westerners, as de Tocqueville noted.
Given the centrality of self-concept to so many psycho-
logical processes, it follows that the unusual emphasis in
America on individualism and independence would be
reﬂected in a wide spectrum of self-related phenomena.
For example, self-concepts are implicated when people
make choices (e.g., Vohs et al. 2008). While Westerners
in general tend to value choices more than non-Wester-
ners do (e.g., Iyengar & DeVoe 2003), Americans value
choices more still, and prefer more opportunities, than
do Westerners from elsewhere (Savani et al. 2008). For
example, in a survey of people from six Western countries,
only Americans preferred a choice from 50 different ice
cream ﬂavors compared with 10 ﬂavors. Likewise, Ameri-
cans (and Britons) prefer to have more choices on menus
in upscale restaurants than do people from other Euro-
pean countries (Rozin et al. 2006). The array of choices
available, and people’s motivation to make such choices,
is even more extreme in the United States compared to
the rest of the West.
Likewise, because cultural differences in analytic and
holistic reasoning styles appear to be inﬂuenced by
whether one views the social world as a collection of dis-
crete individuals or as a set of interconnected relationships
(Nisbett 2003), it follows that exceptionally individualistic
Americans should be exceptionally analytic as well. One
recent study suggests that this might indeed be the case:
Americans showed signiﬁcantly more focused attention
in the Framed Line Task than did people from other Euro-
pean countries (Britain and Germany) as well as from
Japan (Kitayama et al. 2009). Although more research is
needed, Americans may see the world in more analytic
terms than the rest of the West.
Terror management theory maintains that because
humans possess the conscious awareness that they will
someday die, they cope with the associated existential
anxiety by making efforts to align themselves with their
cultural worldviews (Greenberg et al. 1997). The theory
is explicit that the existential problem of death is a
human universal, and indeed posits that an awareness of
death
preceded
the
evolution
of
cultural
meaning
systems in humans (Becker 1973). In support of this argu-
ment of universality, the tendency to defend one’s cultural
worldview following thoughts about death has been found
in every one of the more than a dozen diverse populations
studied thus far. However, there is also signiﬁcant cross-
population diversity in the magnitude of these effects. A
recent meta-analysis of all terror management studies
reveals that the effect sizes for cultural worldview
defense in the face of thoughts of death are signiﬁcantly
more pronounced among American samples (r ¼ 0.37)
than among other Western (r ¼ 0.30) or non-Western
samples (r ¼ 0.26: Burke et al. 2010). Curiously, Ameri-
cans respond more defensively to death thoughts than
do those from other countries.
In the previous section, we discussed Herrmann et al.’s
(2008) work showing substantial qualitative differences in
punishment between Western and non-Western societies.
While Western countries all clump at one end of Figure 4,
the Americans anchor the extreme end of the West’s
distribution. Perhaps it is this extreme tendency for
Americans to punish free-riders, while not punishing
cooperators, that contributes to Americans having the
world’s highest worker productivity. American society is
also anomalous, even relative to other Western societies,
in its low relational focus in work settings, which is
reﬂected in practices such as the encouragement of an
impersonal work style, direct (rather than indirect) com-
munication, the clear separation of the work domain
from the non-work, and discouragement of friendships at
work (Sanchez-Burks 2005).
5.2. Similarities between Americans and other
Westerners
We are unable to locate any research program (other than
the ones reviewed in the ﬁrst two telescoping contrasts)
that has demonstrated that American psychological and
behavioral patterns are similar to the patterns of other
Westerners. We reason that there should be many simi-
larities between the United States and the rest of the
West, and we assume that many researchers share our
impression. Perhaps this is why we are not able to ﬁnd
studies that have been conducted to explicitly establish
these similarities – many researchers likely would not
see such studies as worth the effort. In the absence of
comparative evidence for a given phenomenon, it might
not be unreasonable to assume that the Americans
would look similar to the rest of the West. However, the
above ﬁndings provide a hint that, at least along some
key dimensions, Americans are extreme.
5.3. Summary of Contrast 3
There are few research programs that have explicitly
sought to contrast Americans with other Westerners on
psychological or behavioral measures. However, those
Henrich et al.: The weirdest people in the world?
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:2/3

----- Page 16 (native) -----
phenomena for which sufﬁcient data are available to make
cross-population
comparisons
reveal
that
American
participants are exceptional even within the unusual popu-
lation of Westerners – outliers among outliers.
6. Contrast 4: Typical contemporary American
subjects versus other Americans
The previous contrasts have revealed that WEIRD popu-
lations frequently occupy the tail-ends of distributions of
psychological and behavioral phenomena. However, it is
important to recognize, as a number of researchers have
(e.g., Arnett 2008; Medin & Atran 2004; Sears 1986),
that the majority of behavioral research on non-clinical
populations within North America is conducted with
undergraduates (Peterson 2001; Wintre et al. 2001).
Further, within psychology, the subjects are usually psy-
chology majors, or at least taking introductory psychology
courses. In the case of child participants, they are often the
progeny of high-SES people. Thus, there are numerous
social, economic, and demographic dimensions that tenta-
tively suggest that these subjects might be unusual. But,
are they?
6.1. Comparisons among contemporary adult
Americans
Highly educated Americans differ from other Americans
in many important respects. In the following subsections,
we ﬁrst highlight ﬁndings from social psychology and
then from behavioral economics.
6.1.1. Findings from social psychology. For a number of
the phenomena reviewed above in which Americans were
identiﬁed as global outliers, highly educated Americans
occupy an even more extreme position than less-educated
Americans. Here we itemize eight examples.
1. Although college-educated Americans have been
found to rationalize their choices in dozens of post-
choice dissonance studies, Snibbe and Markus (2005)
found that non-college-educated American adults do not
(cf. Sheth 1970).
2. Although Americans are the most individualistic
people in the world, American undergraduates score
higher on some measures of individualism than do their
non-college-educated counterparts, particularly for those
aspects associated with self-actualization, uniqueness, and
locus of control (Kusserow 1999; Snibbe & Markus 2005).
3. Conformity motivations were found to be weaker
among college-educated Americans than among non-
college-educated Americans (Stephens et al. 2007), who
acted in ways more similar to that observed in East
Asian samples (cf. Kim & Markus 1999).
4. Non-college-educated adults are embedded in more
tightly structured social networks than are college students
(Lamont 2000), which raises the question of whether
research on relationship formation, dissolution, and inter-
dependence conducted among students will generalize to
the population at large (cf. Adams 2005; Falk et al. 2009).
5. A large study that sampled participants from the
general population in southeastern Michigan found that
working-class people were more interdependent and
more holistic than middle-class people (Na et al., in press)
6. The moral reasoning of college-educated Americans
occurs almost exclusively within the ethic of autonomy,
whereas non-college-educated Americans use the ethics
of community and divinity (Haidt et al. 1993; Jensen
1997). Parallel differences exist in moral reasoning
between American liberals and conservatives (Haidt &
Graham 2007).
7. American college students respond more favorably
toward other groups in society, are more supportive of
racial diversity, and are more motivated to mask or
explain away negative intergroup attitudes, than are Amer-
ican (non-student) adults (Henry 2009). This difference is
more problematic because the percentage of psychological
studies of prejudice that exclusively rely on student
samples has increased over the last two decades (from
82.7% to 91.6%), and this percentage is accentuated in
the higher-impact social psychology journals (Henry 2009).
8. A meta-analysis reveals that college students (the vast
majority of whom were American) respond with more cul-
tural worldview defense to death thoughts (r ¼ 0.36) than
do non-college students (r ¼ 0.25: Burke et al. 2010).
More broadly, a second-order meta-analysis (N .
650,000, Number of studies . 7,000) of studies that
included either college student samples or non-student
adult samples revealed that the two groups differed
either directionally or in magnitude for approximately
half of the phenomena studied (e.g., attitudes, gender per-
ceptions, social desirability: Peterson 2001). However, no
clear pattern regarding the factors that accounted for the
differences emerged. Other research has found that Amer-
ican undergraduates have higher degrees of self-monitor-
ing (Reifman et al. 1989), are more susceptible to attitude
change (Krosnick & Alwin 1989), and are more susceptible
to social inﬂuence (Pasupathi 1999) compared to non-
student adults.
6.1.2. Findings from behavioral economics. Consistent
and non-trivial differences between undergraduates and
fully-ﬂedged adults are emerging in behavioral economics
as well. When compared with diverse and sometimes
representative adult samples, undergraduate subjects
consistently set the lower bound for prosociality in experi-
mental measures of trust, fairness, cooperation, and
punishment of unfairness or free-riding. For example, in
both the Ultimatum and Dictator Games, non-student
Americans (both rural and urban participants) make sig-
niﬁcantly higher offers than do undergraduate subjects
(Henrich & Henrich 2007). The difference is most
pronounced in Dictator Games in which samples of
non-student American adults from Missouri (urban and
rural Missouri did not differ) offered a mean 47% of the
total stake while undergraduate freshmen gave 32%, well
within the typical range for undergraduates in this game
(Camerer 2003; Ensminger & Cook, under review;
Henrich & Henrich, under review). These seemingly
high offers among non-students in the Dictator Game
are similar to those found in other non-student samples
in the United States (Carpenter et al. 2005; Henrich &
Henrich 2007). It is the student results that are anomalous.
Similarly, more recent research comparing students with
both representative and selectively diverse samples of
adults using the Trust Game, Ultimatum Game, and
Public Goods Game shows that undergraduates ride the
lower bound on prosociality measures (Bellemare &
Henrich et al.: The weirdest people in the world?

Kro¨ger 2007; Bellemare et al. 2008; Carpenter et al. 2008;
Fehr & List 2004). In fact, “being an undergraduate” (or
being young and educated) is one of the few demographic
variables that seems to matter in explaining within-country
variability.
Behavioral economics research also indicates that devel-
opmental or acculturative changes to some motivations
and preferences are still occurring within the age range
of undergraduates (Henrich 2008). For example, Ulti-
matum Game offers continue to change over the university
years, with freshmen making lower offers than seniors
(Carter & Irons 1991). Other work shows that offers do
not hit their adult plateau in behavioral games until
around age 24 (Carpenter et al. 2005), after which time
offers do not change with age until people reach old age.
In the Trust Game, measures of trust and trustworthiness
increase with age, until they reach a plateau close to age 30
(Sutter & Kocher 2007a).
Such research may explain why treatment effects also
depend on the subject pool used, with students being
the most sensitive. For example, Dictator Game treat-
ments involving double-blind setups, such that the exper-
imenter cannot know how much a subject contributes,
have dramatically smaller effects on offers among non-
student adults, and sometimes no effect at all in adult
populations outside the United States (Lesorogol &
Ensminger, under review). Similarly, unconscious reli-
gious primes increased Dictator Game offers in a Cana-
dian
student
sample
of
religious
and
nonreligious
participants alike, but when non-student adults were
sampled, no signiﬁcant effect emerged for the nonreligious
adults (Shariff & Norenzayan 2007).
For several of these economics measures, such as public
good contributions (Egas & Riedl 2008), undergraduate
behavior is qualitatively similar to fully-ﬂedged adult beha-
viors, just less prosocial. However, in at least one area (so
far), it appears that a particularly interesting phenomenon
is qualitatively absent in undergraduates by comparison
with fully-ﬂedged adults from the same populations: As
discussed earlier for small-scale societies, researchers
using the Ultimatum Game have found systematic, non-
trivial tendencies in many populations to reject offers
greater than 50% of the stake, a phenomenon neither pre-
viously observed in students nor intuited by researchers.
Recent work using representative adult samples has
revealed this tendency for “hyper-fair rejections” among
non-student adults in Western populations, though it is
substantially weaker than in many of the non-Western
populations discussed above (Bellemare et al. 2008;
Guth et al. 2003; Wallace et al. 2007).
6.2. Comparisons among subpopulations of American
children
Although studying young children is one important strategy
for discerning universals, it does not completely avoid these
challenges, as developmental studies are frequently biased
toward middle- and upper-class American children.
Recent evidence indicates that something as seemingly
basic as the differences in spatial reasoning between
males and females (Hyde 1981; Mann et al. 1990; Voyer
et al. 1995) does not generalize well to poor American chil-
dren. On two different spatial tasks, repeated four times
over two years with 547 second- and third-graders, low-
SES children did not show the sex differences observed
in middle- and high-SES children from Chicago (Levine
et al. 2005). Such ﬁndings, when combined with other
research indicating no sex differences on spatial tasks
among migratory foragers (Berry 1966), suggest that a
proper theory of the origins of sex differences in spatial
abilities needs to explain why both poor Chicago children
and foragers do not show any sex differences.
Research on IQ using analytical tools from behavioral
genetics has long shown that IQ is highly heritable, and
not strongly inﬂuenced by shared family environment (Bou-
chard 2004). However, research using 7-year-old twins
drawn from a wide range of socioeconomic statuses, shows
that contributions of genetic variation and shared environ-
ment vary dramatically from low- to high-SES children
(Turkheimer et al. 2003). For high-SES children, where
environmental variability is negligible, genetic differences
account for 70–80% of the variation, with shared environ-
ment contributing less than 10%. For low-SES children,
where there is far more variability in environmental contri-
butions to intelligence, genetic differences account for
0–10% of the variance, with shared environment contribut-
ing about 60%. This raises the specter that much of what we
think we have learned from behavioral genetics may be mis-
leading, as the data are disproportionately inﬂuenced by
WEIRD people and their children (Nisbett 2009).
A similar problem of generalizing from narrow samples
exists for genetics research more broadly. Genetic ﬁndings
obtained with one sample frequently do not replicate in a
second sample, to the point that Nature Genetics now
requires all empirical papers to include data from two
independent samples. There are at least two ways in
which geographically limited samples may give rise to spur-
ious
genotype-phenotype
associations.
First,
the
proportions of various polymorphisms vary across different
regions of the world due to different migratory patterns
and histories of selection (e.g., Cavalli-Sforza et al. 1994).
A genetic association identiﬁed in a sample obtained
from one region may not replicate in a sample from
another region because it involves interactions with other
genetic variants that are not equally distributed across
regions. Second, the same gene may be expressed differ-
ently across populations. For example, Kim et al. (in
press) found that a particular serotonin receptor poly-
morphism (5-HTR1A) was associated with increased atten-
tion to focal objects among Americans, but that the same
allele was associated with decreased attention to focal
objects among Koreans. Researchers would draw different
conclusions regarding the function of this polymorphism
depending upon the location of their sample. A more com-
plete investigation of heritability and genetic associations
demands a comparison of measures across diverse environ-
ments and populations.
6.3. Contemporary Americans compared with previous
generations
Contemporary Americans may also be psychologically
unusual compared to their forebears 50 or 100 years ago.
Some documented changes among Americans over the
past few decades include increasing individualism, as
indicated by increasingly solitary lifestyles dominated by
individual-centered activities and a decrease in group par-
ticipation (Putnam 2000), increasingly positive self-esteem
Henrich et al.: The weirdest people in the world?
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:2/3
17

(Twenge & Campbell 2001), and a lower need for social
approval (Twenge & Im 2007). These ﬁndings suggest
that the unusual nature of Americans in these domains,
as we reviewed earlier, may be a relatively recent phenom-
enon. For example, Rozin (2003) found that attitudes
towards tradition are more similar between Indian
college students and American grandparents than they
are between Indian and American college students.
Although more research is needed to reach ﬁrm con-
clusions, these initial ﬁndings raise doubts as to whether
research
on
contemporary
American
students
(and
WEIRD people more generally) is even extendable to
American students of previous decades.
The evidence of temporal change is probably best for
IQ. Research by Flynn (1987; 2007) shows that IQ
scores increased over the last half century by an average
of 18 points across all industrialized nations for which
there were adequate data. Moreover, this rise was driven
primarily by increasing scores on the analytic subtests.
This
is
a
striking
ﬁnding
considering
recent
work
showing how unusual Westerners are in their analytic
reasoning styles. Given such ﬁndings, it seems plausible
that Americans of only 50 or 100 years ago were reasoning
in ways much more similar to the rest of the non-Western
world than Americans of today.
6.4. Similarities between typical experimental subjects
and other Americans
We expect that typical American subjects are very similar
to other Americans in myriad ways. The problem with this
expectation, however, is that it is not immediately apparent
in which domains they should be similar. We think that
there are enough differences between these two groups
to raise concerns about speaking incautiously on the
thoughts and behaviors of Americans, in general. There
have been rather few studies that have explicitly con-
trasted
whether
undergraduates
or
college-educated
Americans differ in various psychological measures from
those who are not currently students, or who were never
college-educated. There are numerous meta-analyses
that include data from both college student and non-
student samples that speak partially to this issue. Although
the meta-analyses do not specify the national origin of the
participants, we assume that most of the subjects were
American. Some of these analyses indicate considerable
similarity between student and non-student samples. For
example, the aforementioned second-order meta-analysis
(Peterson 2001) revealed similarities between students
and non-student samples for about half of the phenomena.
Similarly, the relation between attribution styles and
depression (Sweeney et al. 1986), and the relations
among intentions, attitudes, and norms (Farley et al.
1981) do not show any appreciable differences between
student and non-student samples. In these instances,
there do not appear to be any problems in generalizing
from student to non-student samples, which may suggest
that college education, and SES more generally, is not
related to these phenomena.
6.5. Summary of Contrast 4
Numerous ﬁndings from multiple disciplines indicate that,
in addition to many similarities, there are differences
among typical subjects and the rest of the American popu-
lation in unexpected domains. In some of these domains
(e.g., individualism, moral reasoning, worldview defense
in response to death thoughts, and perceptions of
choice), the data from American undergraduates rep-
resent even more dramatic departures from the patterns
identiﬁed in non-Western samples. Further, contempor-
ary American college students appear further removed
along some of these dimensions than did their predeces-
sors a few decades earlier. Typical subjects may be outliers
within an outlier population.
7. General discussion
As the four contrasts summarized above reveal, WEIRD
subjects are unusual in the context of the world in some
key ways. In this section, we ﬁrst discuss the main con-
clusions and implications of our empirical review. We
then address two common challenges to our claim that
WEIRD subjects are frequent outliers. Finally, we offer
some recommendations for how the behavioral sciences
may address these challenges.
7.1. Summary of our conclusions and implications
7.1.1. Pronounced population variation is commonplace
in the behavioral sciences. There are now enough sources
of experimental evidence, using widely differing methods
from diverse disciplines, to indicate that there is substan-
tial psychological and behavioral variation among human
populations. As we have seen, some of this variability
involves differences in the magnitude of effects, motiv-
ations, or biases. There is also considerable variability in
both whether certain effects or biases exist in some popu-
lations (as with antisocial punishment and the Mu¨ller-Lyer
illusion) and in which direction they go (as with prefer-
ences for analytic versus holistic reasoning). The causal
origins of such population-level variation may be manifold,
including behavioral plasticity in response to different
environments, epigenetic effects, divergent trajectories
of cultural evolution, and even the differential distribution
of genes across groups in response to divergent evolution-
ary histories. With all these causal possibilities on the
table, we think the existence of this population-level vari-
ation alone should sufﬁce to energize course corrections in
our research directions.
We have also identiﬁed many domains in which there
are striking similarities across populations. These simi-
larities could indicate reliably developing adaptations
(e.g., theory of mind), by-products of innate adaptations
(such as some aspects of religious cognition), or indepen-
dent inventions or diffusions of learned responses that
have universal utility (such as counting systems, dance,
cooking practices, or techniques for making ﬁre). We
have no doubt that there are many more pan-human simi-
larities than we have mentioned (e.g., movement percep-
tion, taste for sugar, chunking, habituation, and depth
computation); however, thus far there are few databases
with individual-level measures sufﬁcient to evaluate the
similarities or differences across populations.
Many of the processes identiﬁed above that vary dra-
matically across populations would seem to be “basic”
psychological processes. The reviewed ﬁndings identiﬁed
Henrich et al.: The weirdest people in the world?
18
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:2/3

variation in aspects of visual perception, memory, atten-
tion,
fairness
motivations,
categorization,
induction,
spatial cognition, self-enhancement, moral reasoning,
defensive responses to thoughts about death, and herit-
ability estimates of IQ. These domains are not unique to
the social world – they span social as well as nonsocial
aspects of the environment, and do not appear to be any
less “fundamental” than those domains for which much
similarity has been identiﬁed. At this point, we know of
no strong grounds to make a priori claims to the “funda-
mentalness” or the likely universality of a given psychologi-
cal process.
The application of evolutionary theory does not provide
grounds for such a priori claims of “fundamental” or
“basic” processes, at least in general. Evolutionary theory
is a powerful tool for generating and eliminating hypoth-
eses. However, despite its power (or perhaps because of
it), it is often overly fecund, as it generates multiple com-
peting hypotheses, with predictions sometimes dependent
on unknown or at least debatable aspects of ancestral
environments. Hence, adjudicating among alternative
evolutionary
hypotheses
often
requires
comparative
work. Moreover, theoretical work is increasingly recogniz-
ing that natural selection has favored ontogenetic adap-
tations that allow humans, and other species, to adapt
non-genetically to local environments (Henrich 2008).
Although we do not yet know of a principled way to
predict whether a given psychological process or behavior-
al pattern will be similar across populations in the absence
of comparative empirical research, it would surely be of
much value to the ﬁeld if there were a set of criteria that
could be used to anticipate universality (Norenzayan
2006; Norenzayan & Heine 2005). Here we discuss some
possible criteria that might be considered.
First, perhaps there are some domains in which
researchers could expect phenomena to be more universal
than they are in other domains. We believe that the degree
of universality does likely vary across domains, although
this has yet to be demonstrated. Many researchers (includ-
ing us) have the intuition that there are cognitive domains
related to attention, memory, and perception in which
inter-population variability is likely to be low. Our
review of the data, however, does not bolster this intuition.
Second, it might be reasonable to assume that some
phenomena are more fundamental to the extent that
they are measured at a physiological or genetic level,
such as genotype-phenotype relations or neural activity.
However, recall that the same genes can be expressed dif-
ferently across populations (e.g., Kim et al., in press), and
the same cognitive task may be associated with different
neural activations across populations (e.g., Hedden et al.
2008). Third, there may be criteria by which one could
conﬁdently make generalizations from one well-studied
universal phenomenon to another similar phenomenon;
for example, because pride displays are highly similar
across populations (e.g., Tracy & Matsumoto 2008), it
might follow that the conceptually related shame display
should also be similar across populations as well (Fessler
1999).
Fourth, it would seem that demonstrating a process or
effect in other species, such as rats or pigeons, would indi-
cate human universality (and more). Although this may
generally be true, several researchers have argued that
culture-gene coevolution has dramatically shaped human
evolution in a manner uncharacteristic of other species
(Richerson & Boyd 2005). Part of this process may
involve the off-loading of previously genetically encoded
preferences and abilities into culture (e.g., tastes for
spices). Fifth, phenomena which are evident among
infants might be reasonably assumed to be more universal
than phenomena identiﬁed in older children or adults. We
suspect this is the case, but it is possible that early biases
can be reversed by later ontogeny. Showing parallel ﬁnd-
ings or effects in both adults and infants from the same
population is powerful, and it raises the likelihood of
universality; but quite different environments might still
shape adult psychologies away from infant patterns (con-
sider the spatial cognition ﬁnding with apes, children,
and adults). Finally, perhaps particular brain regions are
less responsive to experience, such that if a given phenom-
enon was localized to those regions one could anticipate
more universality.
Whatever the relevant principles, it is an important goal
to develop theories that predict which elements of our
psychological processes are reliably developing across
normal human environments and which are locally vari-
able (focusing on the how and why of that variability:
Barrett 2006). We note that behavioral scientists have typi-
cally been overly conﬁdent regarding the universality of
what they study, and as this review reveals, our intuitions
for what is universal do not have a particularly good
track record. We also think this article explains why
those intuitions are so poor: Most scientists are WEIRD,
or were trained in WEIRD subcultures. Hence, any set
of criteria by which universality can be successfully pre-
dicted must be grounded in substantial empirical data.
We look forward to seeing data that can help to identify
criteria to anticipate universality in future research.
7.1.2. WEIRD subjects may often be the worst popu-
lation from which to make generalizations. The empirical
foundation of the behavioral sciences comes principally
from experiments with American undergraduates. The
patterns we have identiﬁed in the available (albeit
limited) data indicate that this sub-subpopulation is
highly unusual along many important psychological and
behavioral dimensions. It is not merely that researchers
frequently make generalizations from a narrow subpopu-
lation. The concern is that this particular subpopulation
is highly unrepresentative of the species. The fact that
WEIRD people are the outliers in so many key domains
of the behavioral sciences may render them one of the
worst subpopulations one could study for generalizing
about Homo sapiens.
To many anthropologically savvy researchers it is not
surprising that Americans, and people from modern indus-
trialized societies more generally, appear unusual vis-a`-vis
the rest of the species. For the vast majority of its evol-
utionary history, humans have lived in small-scale societies
without formal schools, governments, hospitals, police,
complex divisions of labor, markets, militaries, formal
laws, or mechanized transportation. Every household pro-
visioned much or all of its own food; made its own clothes,
tools, and shelters; and – aside from sexual divisions of
labor – most everyone had to master the same skills and
domains of knowledge. Children typically did not grow
up in small, monogamous nuclear families with few kin

around, nor were they away from their families at school
for much of the day.
Rather, through the course of this history, and in some
contemporary societies still, children have typically grown
up in mixed-age playgroups, where they received little
active instruction or exposure to books or TV (Fiske
1998; Lancy 1996; 2008); they learned largely by obser-
vation and imitation; received more directives, more phys-
ical punishment, and less praise; and were less likely to be
engaged in conversation by adults (and there’s no “why”
phase). By age 10, children in some foraging societies
obtain sufﬁcient calories to feed themselves, and routinely
kill and butcher animals. Adolescent females in particular
take on most of the work-related responsibilities of adult
women. People in small-scale societies tend to have less
reliable nutrition, greater exposure to hunger, pain,
chronic diseases, and lethal dangers, and more frequently
experience the death of family members. WEIRD people,
from this perspective, grow up in, and adapt to, a rather
atypical environment vis-a`-vis that of most of human
history. It should not be surprising that their psychological
world is unusual as well.
7.1.3. Research topics have been limited by the heavy
reliance on WEIRD populations. Relying on WEIRD
populations may cause researchers to miss important
dimensions of variation, and devote undue attention to be-
havioral tendencies that are unusual in a global context.
There are good arguments for choosing topics that are of
primary interest to the readers of the literature (i.e.,
largely WEIRD people); however, if the goal of the
research program is to shed light on the human condition,
then this narrow, unrepresentative sample may lead to an
uneven and incomplete understanding. We suspect that
some topics such as self-enhancement, cognitive disso-
nance, fairness, and analytic reasoning might not have
been sufﬁciently interesting to justify in-depth investi-
gation for most humans at most times throughout
history.
Alternatively,
the
behavioral
sciences
have
shown a rather limited interest in such topics as kinship,
food, ethnicity (not race), religion, sacred values, polyg-
amy, animal behavior, and rituals (for further critiques
on this point, see Rozin 2001; Rozin et al. 2006). Had
the behavioral sciences developed elsewhere, important
theoretical foci and central lines of research might likely
look very different (Medin & Bang 2008). Moreover, it
may be unnecessarily difﬁcult to study psychological
phenomena in populations where the phenomena are
unusually weak, as is the case for conformity or shame
among Americans (see Fessler 2004).
7.1.4. Studying children and primates is crucial, but not
a replacement for comparative work. Working with chil-
dren and nonhuman primates is essential for understand-
ing human psychology. However, it is important to note
that despite its great utility and intuitive appeal, such
research does not fully obviate these challenges. In the
case of primate research, discovering parallel results in
great apes and in one human population is an important
step, but it doesn’t tell us how reliably a particular
aspect of psychology develops. As the spatial cognition
work indicates, because language and cultural practices
can – but need not – inﬂuence the cognition humans
acquired
from
their
phylogenetic
history
as
apes,
establishing the same patterns of cognition in apes and
Westerners is insufﬁcient to make any strong claims
about universality. Suppose most psychologists were
Hai\\om speakers (instead of Indo-European speakers);
they might have studied only Hai\\om-speaking children
and adults, as well as nonhuman apes, and concluded
(incorrectly) that allocentric spatial reasoning was univer-
sal. Similarly, imagine if Tsimane economists compared
Ultimatum Game results for Tsimane adults to those for
chimpanzees (Gurven 2004; Henrich & Smith 2001;
Jensen et al. 2007). These researchers would have found
the same results for both species, and concluded that stan-
dard game theoretic models (assuming pure self-interest)
and evolutionary analyses (Nowak et al. 2000) were fairly
accurate predictors in Ultimatum Game behavior for
both chimpanzees and humans – a very tidy ﬁnding. In
both of these cases, the conclusions would be opposite
to those drawn from studies with WEIRD populations.14
Studying children is crucial for developing universal
theories. However, evidence suggests that psychological
differences among populations can emerge relatively
early in children (as with folkbiological reasoning), and
sometimes differences are even larger in children than in
adults, as with the Mu¨ller-Lyer illusion. Moreover, devel-
opmental patterns may be different in different popu-
lations, as with sex differences in spatial cognition
between low-income versus middle- and high-income sub-
populations in the United States, or with performance in
the false belief task. This suggests a need for converging
lines of research. The most compelling conclusions regard-
ing universality would derive from comparative work
among diverse human populations done with both adults
and children, including infants if possible. Human work
can then be properly compared with work among nonhu-
man species (including but not limited to primates), based
on a combination of ﬁeld and laboratory work.
7.1.5. Understanding human diversity is crucial for
constructing
evolutionary
theories
of
human
behavior. Evolution has equipped humans with ontogen-
etic programs, including cultural learning, that help us
adapt our bodies and brains to the local physical and
social environment. Over the course of human history,
convergent forms of cultural evolution have effectively
altered (1) our physical environments with tools, technol-
ogy, and knowledge; (2) our cognitive environments with
counting systems, color terms, written symbols, novel
grammatical structures, categories, and heuristics; and
(3) our social environments with norms, institutions,
laws, and punishments. Broad patterns of psychology
may be – in part – a product of our genetic program’s
common response to culturally constructed environments
that have emerged and converged over thousands of years.
This means that the odd results from small-scale societies,
instead of being dismissed as unusual exceptions, ought to
be considered as crucial data points that help us under-
stand the ontogenetic processes that build our psycholo-
gies in locally adaptive and context-speciﬁc ways.
Based on this and the previous point, it seems clear that
comparative
developmental
studies
involving
diverse
human societies combined with parallel studies of nonhu-
man primates (and other relevant species) provide an
approach to understanding human psychology and behav-
ior that can allow us to go well beyond merely establishing
Henrich et al.: The weirdest people in the world?
20
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:2/3

----- Page 21 (native) -----
universality or variability. Such a systematic, multi-
pronged approach can allow us to test a richer array of
hypotheses about the processes by which both the reliable
universal patterns and the diversity of psychological and
behavioral variation emerge.
7.1.6. Exclusive use of WEIRD samples is justiﬁed when
seeking existential proofs15. Our argument should not be
construed to suggest that the exclusive use of WEIRD
samples should always be avoided. There are cases
where the exclusive use of these samples would be legiti-
mate to the extent that generalizability is not a relevant
goal of the research, at least initially (Mook 1983).
Research programs that are seeking existential proofs for
psychological or behavioral phenomena, such as in the
case of altruistic punishment discussed earlier (e.g., Fehr
& Ga¨chter 2002), could certainly start with WEIRD
samples. That is, if the question is whether a certain
phenomenon can be found in humans at all, reliance on
any slice of humanity would be a legitimate sampling strat-
egy. For another example, Tversky, Kahneman, and their
colleagues sought to demonstrate the existence of systema-
tic biases in decision-making that violate the basic prin-
ciples of rationality (Gilovich et al. 2002). Most of their
work was done with WEIRD samples. Counterexamples
to standard rationality predictions could come from any
sample in the world.16 Furthermore, existential proof for
a psychological phenomenon in WEIRD samples can be
especially compelling when such a ﬁnding is theoretically
unexpected. For example, Rozin and Nemeroff (1990)
found (surprisingly, to many) that even elite U.S. univer-
sity students show some magical thinking. Nevertheless,
even in such cases, learning about the extent to which
population variability affects such phenomena is a necess-
ary subsequent phase of the enterprise, since any theory of
human behavior ultimately has to account for such varia-
bility (if it exists).
7.2. Concerns with our argument
We have encountered two quite different sets of concerns
about our argument. Those with the ﬁrst set of concerns,
elaborated below, worry that our ﬁndings are exaggerated
because (a) we may have cherry-picked only the most
extreme cases that ﬁt our argument, and have thus exag-
gerated the degree to which WEIRD people are outliers,
and/or (b) the observed variation across populations may
be due to various methodological artifacts that arise from
translating experiments across contexts. The second set
of concerns is quite the opposite: Some researchers dis-
missively claim that we are making an obvious point
which everyone already recognizes. Perhaps the most pro-
ductive thing we offer is for these two groups of readers to
confront each other.
We preface our response to the ﬁrst set of concerns with
an admonition: Of course, many patterns and processes of
human behavior and psychology will be generally shared
across the species. We recognize that human thought
and behavior is importantly tethered to our common
biology and our common experiences. Given this, the
real challenge is to design a research program that can
explain the manifest patterns of similarity and variation
by clarifying the underlying evolutionary and developmen-
tal processes.
We offer three general responses to the concern that
our review presents a biased picture. To begin, we con-
structed our empirical review by targeting studies invol-
ving important psychological or behavioral concepts
which were, or still are, considered to be universal, and
which have been tested across diverse populations. We
also listed and discussed major comparative studies that
have identiﬁed important cross-population similarities.
Since we have surely overlooked relevant material, we
invite commentators to add to our efforts in identifying
phenomena
which
have
been
widely
tested
across
diverse subpopulations.
Second, we acknowledge that because proper compara-
tive data are lacking for most studied phenomena, we
cannot accurately evaluate the full extent of how unusual
WEIRD people are. This is, however, precisely the
point. We hope research teams will be inspired to span
the globe and prove our claims of non-representativeness
wrong. The problem is that we simply do not know how
well many key phenomena generalize beyond the extant
database of WEIRD people. The evidence we present
aims only to challenge (provoke?) those who assume that
undergraduates are sufﬁcient to make claims about
human psychology and behavior.
Third, to address the concern that the observed popu-
lation-level differences originate from the methodological
challenges of working across diverse contexts, we empha-
size that the evidence in our article derives from diverse
disciplines, theoretical approaches, and methodological
techniques. They include experiments involving (1) incen-
tivized economic decisions; (2) perceptual judgments; (3)
deceptive experimental practices that prevented subjects
from knowing what was being measured; and (4) children,
who are less likely than adults to have motivations to shape
their responses in ways that they perceive as desirable (or
undesirable) to the experimenter. The ﬁndings, often pub-
lished in the best journals of their respective ﬁelds, hinged
on the researchers making a compelling case that their
methodology was comparably meaningful across the popu-
lations being studied.
Furthermore, the same methods that have yielded
population differences in one domain have demonstrated
similarities in other domains (Atran 2005; Haun et al.
2006b; Henrich et al. 2006; Herrmann et al. 2008;
Medin & Atran 2004; Segall et al. 1966). If one wants to
highlight the demonstrated similarities, one cannot then
ignore the demonstrated differences which relied on the
same or similar methodologies.
Note also that few of the ﬁndings that we reviewed
involve comparing means across subjective self-report
measures, for which there are well-known challenges in
making cross-population comparisons (Chen et al. 1995;
Hamamura et al. 2008; Heine et al. 2002; Norenzayan
et al. 2002b; Peng et al. 1997). Therefore, while methodo-
logical challenges may certainly be an issue in some
speciﬁc cases, we think it strains credulity to suggest that
such issues invalidate the thrust of our argument, and
thus eliminate concerns about the non-representativeness
of typical subjects.
7.3. Our recommendations
Our experience is that many researchers who work exclu-
sively with WEIRD subjects would like to establish the

broad generalizability of their ﬁndings. Even if they
strongly suspect that their ﬁndings will generalize across
the species, most agree that it would be better to have com-
parative data across diverse populations. The problem,
then, is not exclusively a scientiﬁc or epistemological dis-
agreement, but one of institutionalized incentives as well.
Hence, addressing this issue will require adjusting the
existing incentive structures for researchers. The central
focus of these adjustments should be that in presenting
our research designs to granting agencies, or our empirical
ﬁndings in journals, we must explicitly address questions of
generalizability and representativeness. With this in mind,
we offer the following recommendations.
Journal editors and reviewers should press authors to
both explicitly discuss and defend the generalizability of
their ﬁndings. Claims and conﬁdence regarding generaliz-
ability must scale with the strength of the empirical
defense. If a result is novel, being explicitly uncertain
about generalizability should be ﬁne, but one should not
imply
universality
without
an
empirically
grounded
argument.
This does not imply that all experimentalists need to
shift to performing comparative work across diverse
subject pools! As comparative evidence accumulates in
different domains, researchers will be able to assess the
growing body of comparative research and thus be able
to calibrate their conﬁdence in the generalizability of
their ﬁndings. The widespread practice of subtly implying
universality by using statements such as “people’s reason-
ing is biased. . .” should be avoided. “Which people?”
should be a primary question asked by reviewers. We
think this practice alone will energize more comparative
work (Rozin 2009).
The experience of evolutionarily-oriented researchers
attests to the power of such incentives. More than other
researchers in the social sciences, evolutionary researchers
have led the way in performing systematic comparative
work, drawing data from diverse societies. This is not
because they are interested in variation per se (though
some are), but because they are compelled, through
some combination of their scientiﬁc drive and the enthu-
siasm of their critics, to test their hypotheses in diverse
populations (e.g., Billing & Sherman 1998; Buss 1989;
Daly & Wilson 1988; Fessler et al. 2005; Gangestad
et al. 2006; Henrich et al. 2005; Kenrick & Keefe 1992a;
1992b; Low 2000; Medin & Atran 2004; Schaller &
Murray 2008; Schmitt 2005; Sugiyama et al. 2002; Tracy
& Robins 2008).
Meta-analyses are often compromised because many
studies provide little background information about the
subjects. Journal editors should require explicit and
detailed information on subject-pool composition (see
Rozin 2001). Some granting agencies already require
this. Comparative efforts would also be greatly facilitated
if researchers would make their data readily available to
any who asked; or, better yet, data ﬁles should be made
available online. Sadly, a recent investigation found that
only 27% of authors in psychology journals shared their
data when an explicit request was made to them to do so
in accordance with APA guidelines (Wicherts et al.
2006). Tests of generalizability require broad access to
published data.
Given the general state of ignorance with regard to the
generalizability of so many ﬁndings, we think granting
agencies, reviewers, and editors would be wise to give
researchers credit for tapping and comparing diverse
subject pools. Work with undergraduates and the children
who live around universities is much easier than going out
into the world to ﬁnd subjects. As things stand, researchers
suffer a competitive disadvantage when seeking a more
diverse sampling of subjects. Because many of the best
journals routinely require that papers include several
studies
to
address
concerns
about
internal
validity
(Carver 2004), the current incentives greatly favor target-
ing the easiest subject pool to access. There is an often
unrecognized tradeoff between the experimental rigor of
using multiple studies and the concomitant lack of gener-
alizability that easy-to-run subject pools entail (Rozin
2009). If the incentive structure came to favor non-
student subject pools, we anticipate that researchers
could also be more persuasive in encouraging their univer-
sities and departments to invest in building non-student
subject pools – for example, by setting up permanent
psychological and behavioral testing facilities in bus
terminals, Fijian villages, rail stations, airports, and any-
where diverse subjects might ﬁnd themselves with extra
time.
Beyond this, departments and universities should build
research links to diverse subject pools. There are literally
untapped billions of people around the world who would
be willing to participate in research projects, as both
paid subjects and research assistants. The amounts of
money necessary to pay people who might normally
make
less
than
$12
per
day
are
trivial
vis-a`-vis
the average research grant. Development economists,
anthropologists, and public health researchers already do
extensive research among diverse populations, and there-
fore already possess the contacts and collaborations.
Experimentalists merely need to work on building the
networks.
Funding agencies, departments, and universities can
encourage and facilitate both professors and graduate stu-
dents to work on expanding sample diversity. Research
partnerships with non-WEIRD institutions can be estab-
lished to further the goal of expanding and diversifying
the empirical base of the behavioral sciences. By supplying
research leaves, adjusted expectations of student progress,
special funding sources, and institutionalized relationships
to populations outside the university as well as to non-
WEIRD universities, these organizations can make an
important contribution to building a more complete
understanding of human nature.
8. Closing words
Although we are certainly not the ﬁrst to worry about the
representativeness of prevalent undergraduate samples in
the behavioral sciences (Gergen 1973; Medin & Atran
2004; Norenzayan & Heine 2005; Rozin 2001; 2009;
Sears 1986; Sue 1999), our efforts to compile an empirical
case have revealed an even more alarming situation than
previously recognized. The sample of contemporary
Western undergraduates that so overwhelms our database
is not just an extraordinarily restricted sample of humanity;
it is frequently a distinct outlier vis-a`-vis other global
samples. It may represent the worst population on which
to base our understanding of Homo sapiens. Behavioral

scientists now face a choice – they can either acknowledge
that their ﬁndings in many domains cannot be generalized
beyond this unusual subpopulation (and leave it at that), or
they can begin to take the difﬁcult steps to building a
broader, richer, and better-grounded understanding of
our species.

NOTES
1. We also use the term “WEIRD” throughout this paper to
refer to the exceptional nature of this sample, and do not
intend any negative connotations or moral judgments by the
acronym.
2. Key steps include: (1) establishing nationally representative
experimental samples in Europe (Fehr et al. 2002; Guth et al.
2003);
(2)
applying
experimental
methods
in
developing
countries (Cardenas & Carpenter 2008; Tanaka et al., forthcom-
ing); (3) creating university-wide subject recruiting rather than
discipline-speciﬁc subject pools (most economic experiments);
and (4) targeting speciﬁc samples of non-student subjects (Belle-
mare et al. 2008; Bellemare & Kro¨ger 2007; Harrison et al. 2002;
List 2004).
3. Comparative studies of individual decision-making pro-
cesses using samples from small-scale and WEIRD populations,
including explorations of risk aversion, prospect theory, and
inter-temporal choice, yield mixed results. Sometimes simi-
larities, both qualitative and quantitative, are found. Other
times
differences
emerge
(Cardenas
&
Carpenter
2008;
Henrich & McElreath 2002; Hsu et al. 2009; Humphrey &
Verschoor 2004a; 2004b; Kirby et al. 2002; Tanaka et al., forth-
coming). So far, we do not see how to ﬁgure out which features
will vary and which will not.
4. Rivers, for instance, found that cultures with a single color
term for blue and green could still tell the difference between a
blue and a green thread. (See Rivers 1901a).
5. Fessler also emphasizes important differences in shame
and guilt between Americans and Indonesians.
6. To illustrate the limits of inferring universality from two-
population comparisons, we note the ﬁnding that ﬁeld inde-
pendence on the Rod & Frame test is shown for both migratory
foragers and Americans (Witkin & Berry 1975), yet East Asians
and sedentary foragers show evidence for ﬁeld dependence
(Ji et al. 2000).
7. We are using “Western” to refer to those countries clus-
tered in the northwest of Europe (the United Kingdom,
France, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, etc.), and
British-descent societies such as the United States, Canada,
New Zealand, and Australia. In particular, we are concerned
about those populations from which most subjects in behavioral
and psychological experiments are drawn. We recognize that
there are important limitations and problems with this label,
but we use it for convenience.
8. See also Knowles et al. (2001); but, for contrary ﬁndings,
see Lieberman et al. (2005).
9. Interestingly, evidence indicates a somewhat different
pattern in small-scale societies; see Marlowe (2004), Moore
et al. (2006), and Pillsworth (2008).
10. Efforts to replicate these ﬁndings in various small-scale
societies have all failed (Marlowe & Wetsman 2001; Sugiyama
2004; Yu & Shepard 1998). These failures suggest a more compli-
cated
and context-speciﬁc
set
of
evolutionary
hypotheses
(Marlowe et al. 2005; Swami & Tove´e 2007).
11. The factor structure was less evident in a number of devel-
oping populations (e.g., Botswana, Ethiopia, Lebanon, Malaysia,
Puerto Rico, Uganda), where independent assessments revealed
that the data quality was poor. Future efforts to obtain better-
quality data from these countries are important for demonstrat-
ing the universality of the Five Factor Model.
12. The robustness of the Five Factor Model is considerably
weaker when it is derived from indigenous personality traits
from other languages, although some of the ﬁve traits do still
emerge (Benet-Martinez & Waller 1995; Cheung et al. 1996;
Saucier et al. 2005).
13. As American and Canadian researchers at a Canadian uni-
versity, we note that Canada is also a highly unusual population
along the same lines as the United States, although perhaps not
quite as pronounced as the United States, at least in terms of
individualism (Hofstede 1980).
14. These examples illustrate a parallel problem for those
interested in the differences between human and nonhuman
cognition. Since most ape-human comparisons involve WEIRD
people (or their children) as subjects, some seeming ape-
human differences may not represent real species-level contrasts,
but may instead reﬂect the psychological peculiarities of WEIRD
people (Boesch 2007).
15. Thanks to Shaun Nichols for pointing this out.
16. We note that the heuristics and biases derived from this
empirical work were, however, readily extended to “people”
without hesitation (Kahneman et al. 1982).

Abstract: We welcome the critical appraisal of the database used by the
behavioral sciences, but we suggest that the authors’ differentiation
between variable and universal features is ill conceived and that their
categorization of non-WEIRD populations is misleading. We propose a
different approach to comparative research, which takes population
variability seriously and recognizes the methodological difﬁculties it
engenders.
The authors of the target article, Henrich et al., call for an ambi-
tious reorganization of the behavioral sciences, motivated by two
key observations: (1) that the populations on which behavioral
scientists typically base their ﬁndings are outliers from the rest
of humankind; and (2) that there is signiﬁcant population variabil-
ity, which complicates the identiﬁcation of those behavioral and
psychological features that are universal. We start by appraising
Commentary/Henrich et al.: The weirdest people in the world?
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:2/3
23

----- Page 24 (native) -----
each of these observations (in reverse order), and we conclude by
proposing a different approach to comparative research.
1. Population variability. The existence of signiﬁcant popu-
lation variability is convincingly documented by the authors,
who ﬁnd it as soon as they look beyond the ridiculously narrow
samples on which claims of universality have typically been
based. Although in agreement with the ﬁnding, we have a
problem with the authors’ underlying assumption. This is the
idea that it is possible to neatly sort variable features of human
behavior and psychology from universal ones. As anthropologists,
we have no problem in accepting that cultural, historical, and
environmental contexts affect all the features discussed in the
article, but this observation has no bearing on the question of
whether such features are “universal” or “variable.” It is the vari-
able/universal dichotomy itself (and the questions it generates)
that is misleading. This is because human beings are affected
simultaneously by processes of a different nature, among them
phylogeny, history in its social and cultural instantiations, and
ontogeny. But none of these processes is ever active in isolation,
making it impossible to track its universal or variable effects.
Searching in any human phenomenon for the clear signature of
one of these processes in isolation is a wild goose chase.
2. WEIRD as outliers. The authors use three broad population
contrasts in order to zoom in on the weirdness of the subject popu-
lation used to generalize about human nature. The point is well
taken, as is the call for more research among non-WEIRD popu-
lations. In their eagerness to condemn the reliance on WEIRD
subjects, however, the authors end up presenting and conceptua-
lizing population variability in terms of extremely dubious cat-
egories. Curiously, while they feel the need to clarify what they
mean by the term “Western” and to acknowledge its limitations,
they offer no apology for using “small-scale societies” as if the
term referred to a uniﬁed, meaningful whole (a similar point
could be made for “non-Westerner” or “East Asian”). This uncri-
tical lumping together of a variety of disparate societies is particu-
larly odd in a paper that denounces unsound generalizations. As
clearly demonstrated by the results of the economic games,
some “small-scale societies” can vary just as much among them-
selves as they do from the WEIRD population – a fact that
should not be surprising given that “small-scale societies” are as
caught up in the ﬂow of human history as any other. One could
argue that the extreme weirdness of the WEIRD population is
partly the result of having lumped together other populations
under too simplistic and under-theorized labels.
3. Our proposal. As anthropologists committed to the study of
human nature (see Bloch 2005), we welcome Henrich et al.’s
critical appraisal of the behavioral sciences’ comparative data-
base. We feel, nonetheless, that the authors have not sufﬁciently
taken to heart the fundamental implications of their analysis. One
obvious conclusion they might have drawn is that behavioral
scientists should pay more attention to the work of cultural/
social anthropologists, since these are the scientists who have
made human variability their main focus. It is striking,
however, how little reference Henrich et al. make to anthropolo-
gical research. This, of course, is no accident. It has to do with the
kind of data that anthropologists have produced, which in turn
has to do with the history of their discipline.
At the start, anthropologists went to the ﬁeld with ready-made
questions that were generated by a simplistic, yet highly inﬂuen-
tial, evolutionary theory, which is still the basis of popular under-
standings of the difference between “civilized” and “primitive”
societies (the latter sometimes euphemistically called “small-
scale”). But such outmoded theory had to be abandoned
because, it was soon realized, human history does not proceed
along a progressive and unilineal path. Because of the human
capacity for culture, each human society is the unique product
of a unique, albeit not isolated, history.
Ever since the recognition of this fact, anthropologists have
faced a methodological difﬁculty: Questions formulated from
within one historical context produce misleading answers when
transposed elsewhere, as they appear weird, uninterpretable, or
mean something else (arguably, this is what generates the weird-
ness of the WEIRD population, since what distinguishes it from
all the others is that it is the one that generates the questions).
The way anthropologists have tried to overcome this challenge
has been to abandon, initially at least, all questions formulated
outside the context under their investigation. Rather, through
participant observation, they have allowed themselves to dis-
cover, from the inside, the terms and values of the people they
study. This strategy is not without difﬁculties, as it generates a
kind of data that appears impressionistic and anecdotal and
which, crucially, precludes comparison and generalization –
which is why such data is so often ignored by other behavioral
scientists, such as the authors of the target article. We recognize
that this is a very serious limitation, but we insist that behavioral
scientists must acknowledge and never underestimate the equally
serious and unavoidable problem that led anthropologists down
this methodological route in the ﬁrst place.
Therefore, the solution cannot be, as suggested by Henrich
et al., to administer studies upon studies to the billions of
(poor) people around the world who remain untapped by the be-
havioral sciences. The solution is far more complicated and
costly. It requires an often uncomfortable compromise between
internal validity and generality, and a lot more detailed ethno-
graphic work than many seem to be willing to accept (see, e.g.,
Astuti & Harris 2008; Astuti et al. 2004). Only in this way will
data from non-WEIRD populations become a meaningful and
indispensable ingredient of any general theory about our species.

Abstract: While we agree that the cultural imbalance in the recruitment
of participants in psychology experiments is highly detrimental, we
emphasize the need to complement this criticism with a warning about
the “weirdness” of some cross-cultural studies showing seemingly deep
cultural differences. We take the example of economic games and
suggest that the variety of results observed in these games may not be
due to deep psychological differences per se, but rather due to
different interpretations of the situation.
Henrich et al.’s article ﬂeshes out in a very useful and timely
manner comments often heard but rarely published about the
extraordinary cultural imbalance in the recruitment of partici-
pants in psychology experiments and the doubt this casts on gen-
eralization of ﬁndings from these “weird” samples to humans in
general. The authors mention that one of the concerns they
have met in defending their views has been of a methodological
nature: “the observed variation across populations may be due to
various methodological artifacts that arise from translating exper-
iments across contexts” (sect. 7.2, para. 1). Here we want to
express a less sweeping methodological concern. While accepting
the general conclusions and recommendations of the article, we
believe they should be complemented with a warning about the
“weirdness” of some experimental designs that have been used
across cultures and seem to show deep cultural differences. In
fact, they may just show quite different interpretations of the
experimental situation by the participants. This is not to deny,
of course, that these differences in interpretations are themselves

----- Page 25 (native) -----
both psychological and cultural and are worth studying in their
own right. In fact, unless one pays attention to them, it unclear
what the experimental evidence is really about.
Let us illustrate our point with the case of economic games
(discussed in sections 3.2, 4.1, and 6.1 of the target article). In
these experiments, people are given a sum of money for free
(which never happens in the real life) and have to share it with
someone about whom they have no information (which also
never happens in real life). Many researchers, including one of
the article’s authors (see Henrich et al. 2005), have pointed out
that cultural variations in economic games may have more to
do with methodological problems than with actual cultural differ-
ences (Ensminger 2002; Heintz 2005; Lesorogol 2007). In par-
ticular, participants in these games have no information about
the rights of each player over the stake and are asked to make
a “blind” decision. But who owns the money? Is the money a
gift? Is the money a payment in exchange for my participation?
Who is the other participant? Is he or she someone I know?
Does he or she have rights over the money? And so on.
This leaves open the possibility that behavioural differences
observed in economic games are not due to deep psychological
differences per se, but rather due to different interpretations of
the situation (for a similar point, see Hagen & Hammerstein
2006; Heintz 2005). For example, Henrich et al.’s (2005) study
in 15 small-scale societies reveals a striking difference between
the Lamalera, who make very generous offers in the Ultimatum
Game, and the Tsimane and the Machigenga, who make very
low offers in the very same game. But the game is likely to be con-
strued very differently within these societies. The Lamalera,
being collective hunters, may indeed see the money as jointly
owned by the proposer and the recipient. By contrast, the
Tsimane and the Machigenga, who are solitary horticulturalists,
may see the money as their own property and therefore feel
entitled to keep it. In the same way, Westerners may appear as
outliers not because they have a different moral psychology,
but rather because, living in very large, democratic and capitalist
societies, they make different assumptions in economic games
(e.g., that, not knowing the other participant – a situation of
anonymity that is common in large-scale urban societies – they
have no particular duty to share the stake with her).
In line with this idea, economic games framed within a more
detailed context tend to show that people’s decisions are based
on property rights (Oxoby & Spraggon 2008), past contributions
to collective actions (Cappelen et al. 2007; Frohlich et al. 2004),
or a personal link of solidarity (Cronk 2007). One possible
interpretation is that participants try to be fair with others
when they distribute the money: If the other player has produced
the money, she has more right over it; if she has been more pro-
ductive or has invested more money, she deserves a bigger part
of it; if both players are friends, they have special duties toward
each other; and so forth. Such a “sense of fairness” combined
with contextual differences might well explain the variety of
results observed around the world. When confronted with cul-
tural differences in experimental result, we should therefore
ask: Are they the product of deep differences in the psychological
dispositions and processes these experiments are intended to illu-
minate, or do they reﬂect differences in the interpretation of the
experimental situation? One way to help answer this question
would be, for instance, to present the Lamalera and the Machi-
genga with, as much as possible, the same rich context (e.g., clar-
ifying the source of the money and the relationships between the
participants) and assess whether they use the parameters at stake
(i.e., rights, past contributions, social links) in the same way.
The importance of the way participants interpret a task – which
may differ from the way the experimenter intended them to inter-
pret it – has been often stressed in experimental psychology (e.g.,
Sperber et al. 1995). The more the experiment is artiﬁcial and
devoid of “ecological validity” – in other terms, the weirder it is –
the greater the risk of misinterpreting the differences between
societies. When it comes to cross-cultural comparisons, ignoring
this pragmatic dimension of participants’ performance may cause
one to exaggerate or to miss genuine psychological differences.

Abstract: Henrich et al.’s critical review demonstrating that psychology
research
is
over-reliant
on
WEIRD
samples
is
an
important
contribution to the ﬁeld. Their stronger claim that “WEIRD subjects
are particularly unusual” is less convincing, however. We argue that
WEIRD people’s apparent distinct weirdness is a methodological
side-effect of psychology’s over-reliance on WEIRD populations for
developing its methods and theoretical constructs.
In their important article, Henrich et al. offer both weak and strong
versionsofanargumentagainst the widespread use ofresearchwith
WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Demo-
cratic) people as a means to learn about general human psychology.
The weak version critiques the over-reliance on such samples and
reviews an extensive body of literature across domains to establish
that widespread cross-cultural differences exist for many of the
psychological ﬁndings researchers have assumed were species uni-
versal. We are one hundred percent convinced of the weak argu-
ment and strongly endorse its attendant plea for moving beyond
WEIRD samples. Their review is a major contribution to the litera-
ture, and we thank the authors for it.
The strong version of the argument makes the additional point
that WEIRD people are literally weird, atypical of humankind at
large. On this account, it is the ﬁeld’s ironic misfortune that of all
samples to study, psychology should have picked this one. This
strong argument is intriguing, and Henrich et al. present extensive
evidence suggesting that this narrow slice of humanity indeed is a
cultural outlier. For reasons that form the basis of our commentary,
however, we remain skeptical with respect to this strong argument.
The evidence for the distinctness of WEIRD samples comes
from studies that generally take the following form: Findings
originally conducted on the WEIRD population are assessed
with a different population, and a different pattern of results
emerges. When a broader range of groups is considered, the
WEIRD population tends to be at the extreme in its responses.
For example, Henrich et al. cite Segall and colleagues’ replication
of the well-known Mu¨ller-Lyer illusion (Segall et al. 1996). Segall
et al. ﬁnd not only a wide distribution of the magnitude of the
illusion across cultures, but also that the U.S. sample is the
most extreme in magnitude (see their Fig. 1). Other phenomena
they review demonstrate a similar trend.
Base rates provide one clue that there might be something
amiss with the argument that the group with which we are
most intimately familiar is also the most distinctive. If there are
a thousand potential samples, then the probability that the ﬁrst
selected is the most deviant is one out of a thousand.
We think the apparent extremity of WEIRD populations can
best be explained by two factors contributing to what we have
called “the home-ﬁeld disadvantage” – that is, the tendency for
research developed in one’s “home-culture” and subsequently
co-opted for cross-cultural comparison to result in one-sided
conclusions about the nature of cross-cultural differences (Medin
et al., under review).
The ﬁrst factor is the similarity between researcher and
researched. Variations across cultures may reﬂect both adaptations
to particular environments (e.g., Nisbett & Cohen 1996) and “niche

construction” (environmental adaptations that favor and reinforce
cultural characteristics; Laland et al. 2000). For example, it may
not matter whether people drive on the left or right side of roads;
but once there is a consensus in a given culture, it is adaptive to
conform to it. Researchers may have privileged insight in their
own culture into what is important or what experimental manipula-
tions are likely to achieve interesting and reliable results, and they
may ﬁnd it natural to study these sorts of things. But the very fact
that the results are important, interesting, or reliable in one’s
home culture makes it more likely that one’s culture represents
an extreme with respect to those results (see Medin & Bang 2008).
The other main factor reinforcing apparent extremes among
WEIRD samples is their status as the originating research popu-
lation. Research methods and theoretical constructs are calibrated
to the populations they have been selected and designed for: in psy-
chology’s case, WEIRD people. A side-effect is that these same tools
are less well ﬁt or even ill ﬁt to other populations, in much the same
way that any adaptation evolved for a particular niche will not func-
tion as well in other niches. For example, imagine a literature on
sense of humor evolved from studies with undergraduates at
major U.S. universities. Jokes that proved to be effective would
tend to appear in later studies and ones that fell ﬂat would tend to
go by the wayside. Ifone then gotthebrightidea of doing across-cul-
tural comparison, it may seem natural to use the same jokes favored
by U.S. college students, with the more or less inevitable conse-
quence that other populations wouldn’t ﬁnd these jokes quite so
funny, and the U.S. college sample would appear to be an extreme.
Consider the Mu¨ller-Lyer illusion mentioned above and dis-
cussed in the target article. That particular illusion is a classic
of Western psychology, taught in any introductory class discuss-
ing perceptual illusions. And it is taught because it is so readily
demonstrated, a fact that reveals both general properties of the
perceptual system and a response to the perceptual environment
in which Westerners live. Small wonder that the effect is weaker
in populations exposed to a different perceptual environment.
Similarly, some novel perceptual illusion discovered in some
other population is likely to be smaller in magnitude when
tested with our WEIRD sample. But that is just our point – over-
whelmingly, psychological research originates with the WEIRD
sample and then is applied elsewhere – the converse pattern is
rare. We believe that this habit of using research methods and
theoretical constructs (stimuli, procedures, models, etc.) for
cross-cultural
comparisons
that
originated
with
WEIRD
samples, coupled with insider information about what those
WEIRD samples ﬁnd important and which experimental manip-
ulations are likely to achieve interesting and reliable results, may
well account for the apparent extremity of the WEIRD popu-
lation. Had psychology started with Chinese rice farmers study-
ing members of their own community and then later their
research protocols and theoretical constructs were exported for
cross-cultural comparison and tested for universal validity,
then, on our account, Chinese rice farmers would be the cultural
outliers and WEIRD people would look more like everyone else.

Abstract: The quest to understand “what makes us human” has been
heading towards an impasse, when comparative psychology compares
primarily individuals that are not representative of their species.
Captives experience such divergent socioecological niches that they
cannot
stand
for
their
wild
counterparts.
Only
after
removing
ethnocentrism and anthropocentrism will we be able to progress in our
understanding of “what makes us human.”
Henrich et al.’s review of cognitive differences among human
cultures is very timely in reminding us that different living con-
ditions have consequences for cognitive development. Not all
humans are Westerners, and this is true also for their cognition.
Here, I want to address how this affects our understanding of
cognitive differences between humans and chimpanzees, and
requires reconsideration of many claims about “what makes us
human” (Boesch 2007; 2008). To become a science, comparative
psychology will have to include population differences in its
theoretical thinking and empirical approaches.
Comparative psychology suffers from the same weaknesses as
noted by Henrich et al. for psychology. Bold claims about
“human uniqueness” are made based on the assumption that
WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Demo-
cratic) societies’ humans (I referred to them as WMC, or
Western middle class, humans; Boesch 2007) and captive chim-
panzee populations are representative of each of the two species
(Boesch 2007; de Waal 2001). Comparative psychology predomi-
nantly compared captive chimpanzees with free Western humans
(see black arrow A in my Figure 1). The overwhelming con-
clusion of these studies was that humans clearly outperform
chimpanzees in such different cognitive domains as folk
physics, altruism, cooperation, theory of mind, and gaze follow-
ing (e.g., Hermann et al. 2007; Povinelli 2000; Povinelli &
Vonk 2003; Silk et al. 2005; Tomasello et al. 2005).
However, three essential points that invalidate their conclusions
have been too often forgotten in the interpretation of such studies.
First, the characteristics of the animal populations included in
these studies are typically not representative of their species.
The Louisiana captive chimpanzee group that has been used
extensively in a variety of widely cited cognitive studies (e.g., Povi-
nelli 2000; Povinelli & Vonk 2003; Silk et al. 2005; Vonk et al. 2008)
nicely illustrates this point (see Fig. 1). This group was created by
putting together seven 2- to 3-year-old chimpanzees that were
kept in isolation as a same-aged peers group all their lives, in a
small, stable, and restricted man-made environment (see Povinelli
2000). Such a history cannot be more different from the one of
young chimpanzees in the wild. Wild individuals live in large, ﬂex-
ible, ﬁssion-fusion groups, with 30 to 100 individuals of different
Figure 1 (Boesch).

ages, in kilometer-wide ranges where food has to be located and
extracted, and where life-threatening neighbors and predators
loom (e.g., Mitani et al. 2002). True, captive conditions range
from highly ecologically deprived environments, typical for the
early 1950s, to much more enriched conditions, as seen in
modern settings. Moreover, social conditions vary from complete
isolation to more social groups. However, all captive conditions
differ from wild ones in that captives are forced to live in much
smaller, stable social groups, in very passive environments where
food is provided and no competition with others exists. The
ﬁelds of developmental and social psychology have shown that
such differences have important effects on cognitive development
in humans (Carpendale & Lewis 2004; Nelson et al. 2007).
No surprise that some captive chimpanzees have difﬁculties in
understanding unseen relationships (Povinelli 2000), whereas
wild chimpanzees transport stone hammers to distant, out-of-
sight nut-producing trees (Boesch & Boesch 1984) and use
tools to extract unseen underground resources (Boesch et al.
2009; Sanz et al. 2004). Similarly, some captives are unable to
share food (Silk et al. 2005; Warneken & Tomasello 2006) or to
work as a team with shared goals (Tomasello et al. 2005),
whereas wild individuals share vast quantities of food with unre-
lated group members for extended periods of time and work as a
close team when hunting prey, chasing leopards, or during risky
intergroup encounters (e.g., Boesch & Boesch 1989; Boesch et al.
2008; 2010; Goodall 1986; Mitani & Watts 2005).
Second, comparative psychology has favored experimental
studies using anthropocentric designs and assumptions. These
might allow testing human abilities in other species, but are unli-
kely to uncover cognitive abilities of nonhuman animals. For
example, to understand the altruistic abilities of chimpanzees,
experiments have been designed on the ethnocentric assumption
that sharing should be preferred over nonsharing when there is
no cost to oneself (Silk et al. 2005). However, sharing implies a
contractual obligation in some human populations (Henrich
et al. 2006; and present study in the target article); and, therefore,
this assumption does not even hold in all human populations.
Similarly, numerous experiments with captive chimpanzees
used a WEIRD notion of causality. In gaze-following exper-
iments, tested animals needed to understand that a human
gaze indicated an honest positive interest (Hermann et al.
2007; Tomasello et al. 2005). In helping experiments, tested indi-
viduals had to understand that experimenters pretending to not
master a task needed to be helped (Warneken & Tomasello
2006). Less ethnocentric and anthropocentric experiments
would bring us a long way to understand other species.
Third, by favoring experiments in captive settings, comparative
psychology has opted for low ecological validity. For example,
altruism in wild chimpanzees is expressed mainly in situations
where a highly sought after food, meat, is shared with individuals
that are socially important to the giver, either because they are
hunting partners or social allies (Boesch 2009; Mitani & Watts
2001). Such a social dimension has rarely been considered in
comparative
experiments.
Similarly,
chimpanzees
primarily
cooperate during life-threatening situations, such as during inter-
group ﬁghts or when predators are near, or to get meat (Boesch
2009; Goodall 1986). The difﬁculties with mimicking such situ-
ations in experiments have not prevented comparative psycholo-
gists from making strong claims about chimpanzees’ limitations
(Herrmann et al. 2007; Povinelli 2000; Tomasello et al. 2005).
Comparative psychologists’ inability to mimic natural cooperative
conditions is not proof that cooperative ability is absent in other
animal species.
The quest to understand “what makes us human” has been
heading towards an impasse. It will progress again once the socio-
ecological diversity of humans and other species are considered. I
am asking for greater care before making sweeping claims based
on only a few captive individuals. Knowing that cognitive diver-
sity is natural in species living in different socioecological
conditions, we need to compare what is comparable (following
white arrow B in Figure 1). Only when this condition is met
will our quest to understand “what makes us human” progress.
The WEIRD are even weirder than you think:

Abstract: We argue that Henrich et al. do not go far enough in their
critique: Sample diversiﬁcation, while important, will not lead to the
detection of generalizable principles. For that it will be necessary to
broaden the range of contexts in which data are gathered. We
demonstrate the power of contexts to alter results even in the presence
of sample diversiﬁcation.
We commend Henrich et al. for pointing out the (over)reliance
on participants from WEIRD societies and the tenuousness of
universal laws whose support is based on a single subpopulation
of a single society. Notwithstanding the merit of studying partici-
pants from diverse races, social classes, and national cultures, this
will not in itself lead to generalizability of ﬁndings because it
leaves unaddressed other threats to generalization, including
the restricted physical, ideological, and attitudinal parameters
of most research, and the omission of social meanings that par-
ticipants attach to their choices.
Even when researchers include non-WEIRD participants,
they rarely include contextual variation. Few of our principles
are based on data from diverse settings and conditions. On
those occasions when researchers do insert contextual diversity
into their designs, it becomes apparent that theorizing is para-
digm-bound – conﬁned to the speciﬁc physical, motivational,
and psychological conditions under which the data were gath-
ered. Below we argue for the power of manipulating the
context and social meanings, independent of sample diversity.
Motivational context. When researchers contrast paradigms
across settings, stimuli, and/or conditions, the results sometimes
fail to replicate. For example, Ceci and Bronfenbrenner (1991,
cited in Ceci 1996) asked children to predict where on a
monitor geometric shapes would migrate after children pressed
the space bar. A curvilinear algorithm determined where each
shape would migrate1:
:8 sin (x) þ :6 sin (y) þ :4 sin (z) þ 5%error
Even after 750 trials, children were still unable to predict the
shapes’ migration. The implication is that multiplicative reason-
ing is beyond their capability.
As shown in our Figure 1, however, when the identical algor-
ithm controlled a video game in which the object was to predict
the destination at which vehicles would meet a roadblock, chil-
dren reached ceiling by 450 trials (Ceci 1996). Thus, behavior
in ecologically challenging contexts led to ﬁndings at odds with
those from socially sanitized settings.
Semantic context. Much research on memory, reasoning, and
moral development is based on stimuli expunged of meaningful
associations (e.g., nonsense syllables) in the belief this will
reveal underlying principles. For example, Wason’s deduction
Commentary/Henrich et al.: The weirdest people in the world?
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:2/3
27

----- Page 28 (native) -----
task has been used to illuminate qualities of thinking. However,
even when participants were from other cultures, it was clear
that deduction depended on the content. Consider: The logic
underlying Wason’s task is that any inference that has the form:
p or q
not– p
[q
is
valid
independent
of
the
propositional
content.
However, it has been repeatedly shown this is not true
and that content matters. Suppose four cards are laid out
E K 4 7
with the instructions that each card has a number on one
side and a letter on the other. Participants are told: If a
card has a vowel on one side, then it has an even
number on the other side. Their job is to determine
which cards must be turned over to validate the rule.
Even smart undergraduates have success rates of only
12%. However, if the content is changed to a mode of
transportation on one side of each card and a destination
on the other
Manchester Sheffield Train Car
and the rule is: Every time I go to Manchester, I go by
train. Nothing has changed logically, but performance sky-
rockets to 60% (Johnson-Laird 1983). Similarly, we have
demonstrated that differences in the way meaning is rep-
resented mediate children’s metacognition (Ceci et al.
2010).
Cultural-cognitive context. Two of us (Kahan, Braman) have
demonstrated that Americans who vary in their attitudes
toward hierarchy and equality vary in their perceptions of
legally consequential facts (Kahan, in press; Kahan et al. 2009).
These competing attitudes cohere with opposing sets of norms,
and related scripts of acceptable behavior, which can trump
the demographic variables emphasized by the WEIRD critique
(Kahan et al. 2007).
Social meaning context. Actions have meanings as well as con-
sequences. They embody attitudes, the expression of which
shapes actors’ perceptions of what they are doing and hence
the value of doing it. For example, under what circumstances
will an actor prefer the certainty of one sum to the probability
of another? “When the expected value of the former exceeds
the latter,” the classical microeconomist says, “subject to one’s
degree of risk aversion,” which the behavioral economist notes
will vary depending on whether one understands the exchange
as realizing a “gain” as opposed to avoiding a “loss.” But
experimental work shows the answer also depends on what
such an exchange means. Most members of WEIRD societies
will shun trades involving tax evasion that they might well have
accepted in the form of casino wagers, because the former,
even if equivalent to the latter along the dimensions speciﬁed
by economists, manifests attitudes and values antithetical to the
self-conception of (most) WEIRD people (Baldry 1986). Like-
wise, economists’ considerations – dominant payoff strategies,
signaling, reciprocity – don’t tell us all we must know to
predict whether individuals will contribute to public goods (Lib-
erman et al. 2004). Even the bedrock axiom of economics –
“demand curves slope downward” – founders on the shoals of
meaning. Offering a wage can cause persons who previously
did community service for free to refrain from doing any:
payment destroys the meaning, and thus the associated value,
of public-spirited behavior (Gneezy & Rustichini 2000).
In a nutshell, ignoring meaning – as behavioral economics and
related approaches do – generates unreliable predictions for any
collection of persons who experience a common life. Heinrich
et al. rightly question whether the behavioral dynamics in the
work they examine generalize to non-WEIRD samples. But it
is important not to assume this critique identiﬁes some distinctive
problem hovering at the “margins” of that work. Indeed, what
does generalize about the new behavioral science is the question
about its external validity: its neglect of meaning and other
elements of context gives us reason to be cautious about accept-
ing extrapolations from its stylized experiments.
In sum, our argument is that although we agree with Henrich
et al. on the need to diversify samples, this alone will not unearth
generalizable principles because contexts, attitudes, and mean-
ings contribute systematic variance that must be included to
reveal lawful ecological contrasts.

Abstract: Henrich et al. provide a compelling argument about a bias in
the behavioral sciences to study human behavior primarily in WEIRD
populations. Here we argue that brain scientists are susceptible to
similar biases, sampling primarily from WEIRD populations; and we
discuss recent evidence from cultural neuroscience demonstrating the
importance and viability of investigating culture across multiple levels
of analysis.
Henrich et al. provide a compelling argument regarding the error
of assuming minimal variability across human populations in the
behavioral sciences and the notion that people from WEIRD
populations are actually unusual, even outliers, relative to the
rest of the species. Here we argue that these problems of prema-
turely assuming universalism and experimentally sampling pri-
marily from WEIRD populations extend beyond the behavioral
sciences, into the brain sciences, and that researchers in both
the behavioral and brain sciences may simultaneously beneﬁt
from reorganizing research infrastructures to promote the
study of diverse cultural comparisons across multiple levels of
analysis.

Brain scientists generalize from a narrow sample to the
species. Akin to the behavioral sciences, brain sciences typically
sample from a thin slice of the species. Within the ﬁeld of psy-
chology, 95% of psychological samples come from countries
with only 12% of the world’s population (Arnett 2008). Similarly,
within the ﬁeld of human neuroimaging, 90% of peer-reviewed
neuroimaging studies come from Western countries (Chiao
2009).
Several factors have contributed to the current WEIRD
sampling bias in the brain sciences. First, human neuroscience
research programs typically build on either empirical questions
inspired by animal models, or case studies of brain damaged
patients, or theories from evolutionary psychology. Each of
these three starting points for neuroscience research carries
implicit assumptions of minimal variability across human popu-
lations. Second, researchers have lacked the technology to
study culture at the neural level in humans, as human neuroima-
ging methods have become available only within the past three
decades and are still not available in many non-Western
regions of the world. The use of neuroimaging is often prohibi-
tively expensive, making it easier for richer, politically stable
countries, such as Western industrialized nations, to create
the powerful societal infrastructures necessary for novel and
timely neuroscientiﬁc discovery. The infrastructural advantages
afforded
to
neuroscientists
from
WEIRD
nations
create
researcher biases in the ﬁeld that are cyclical and that compound
over time as researchers create new experiments and seek
empirical evidence consistent with theory and predictions
based on prior ﬁndings. Hence, our current state of knowledge
of mind-brain mappings is largely restricted to scientiﬁc obser-
vations made from people living within WEIRD nations,
leaving a large empirical gap in our understanding of how
diverse cultures affect mind, brain, and behavior.
It is not safe for brain scientists to generalize from a narrow
sample to the species. In the target article, the authors identify
key cultural comparisons that reveal behavioral differences
across cultures, including
industrialized versus small-scale
societies, Western versus non-Western cultures, contemporary
American versus non-American Westerners, and contemporary
Americans versus other Americans. To the extent that behavior
arises from neurobiological processes, it is plausible that this
set of cultural comparisons would similarly reveal cultural differ-
ences in neural functioning.
Indeed, early efforts by cultural neuroscientists to address the
question of how culture inﬂuences brain function have proven
fruitful, particularly for understanding differences in neurobiolo-
gical processing between Westerners and East Asians. Wester-
ners engage brain regions associated with object processing to
a greater extent relative to East Asians, who are less likely to
focus exclusively on objects within a complex visual scene
(Gutchess et al. 2006). Westerners show differences in medial
prefrontal activity when thinking about themselves relative to
close others, but East Asians do not (Zhu et al. 2007). Activations
in frontal and parietal regions associated with attentional control
show greater response when Westerners and East Asians are
engaged in culturally preferred judgments (Hedden et al.
2008). Even evolutionarily ancient limbic regions, such as the
human amygdala, respond preferentially to fearful faces of
one’s own cultural group (Chiao et al. 2008, Fig. 1). Taken
together, these ﬁndings show cultural differences in brain
functioning across a wide variety of psychological domains and
demonstrate the importance of comparing, rather than generaliz-
ing, between Westerners and East Asians at a neural level.
What about cultural differences in brain function beyond
comparisons of Westerners and East Asians? Critically, brain
scientists have yet to explore the neurobiological ramiﬁcations
of cultural contrasts beyond Westerners and East Asians. No
research to date has explored comparisons in neural functioning
of individuals living in small-scale versus industrialized societies.
Additionally, although neuroimaging data do exist for comparing
the neural functioning of contemporary Americans with that of
other Westerners, such as Europeans, no study to our knowledge
has yet explored in a hypothesis-driven manner the possibility
that brain–behavior relations may vary as a function of the
kind of Western subculture. Social neuroscientists have recently
begun to address how childhood socioeconomic status affects
brain functioning (Hackman & Farah 2009); however, the
effect of education level (e.g., college vs. no college education)
on neural functioning remains unknown. Hence, the current
state of knowledge in cultural neuroscience remains woefully
behind that of cultural psychology. Yet, the knowledge to date
supports the notion that it is not always safe for brain scientists

to generalize from a narrow sample to the species and that
restricting neuroscientiﬁc study to WEIRD populations will not
be sufﬁcient for building a comprehensive understanding of
human nature.
Behavioral scientists and brain scientists alike will mutually
beneﬁt from studying non-WEIRD populations. The journey
towards understanding how culture affects human nature is
one that behavioral and brain scientists can readily embark on
together, and likely with mutual beneﬁts. For instance, where
do these cultural differences in brain and behavior come from?
One possibility is that psychological and neural diversity comes
from differential experience speciﬁc to a given culture. Another
possibility is that diversity in brain and behavior results from
culture-gene
coevolution,
whereby
culture
coevolves
with
genes that regulate endophenotypes, such as brain and behavior.
Testing both explanations requires empirical work that examines
multiple levels of analysis (e.g., gene, brain, mind, culture) across
multiple time scales (e.g., situation, ontogeny, phylogeny).
It is humbling to think of the sheer volume of work that lies
ahead to address these timely questions, but by working together,
behavioral and brain scientists can offer each other a more com-
plete cultural science than either can construct alone.
Diversity in representations; uniformity in
learning

Abstract: Henrich et al.’s conclusion that psychologists ought not assume
uniformity of psychological phenomena depends on their descriptive
claim that there is no pattern to the great diversity in psychological
phenomena. We argue that there is a pattern: uniformity of learning
processes (broadly construed), and diversity of (some) mental contents
(broadly construed).
Henrich et al. argue – correctly, in our view – that there is great
diversity both across and within domains of human cognition.
They then argue for the stronger claim that there is no underlying
rhyme or reason for this diversity. This latter claim grounds their
central methodological point: For all (interesting and not
obviously culturally induced) cognitive phenomena, psychologists
ought not automatically conclude, from samples of Western
undergraduates, that any particular cognitive phenomenon is
uniform across people. This methodological conclusion obviously
depends crucially on the stronger descriptive claim. If a pattern of
uniformity emerged with respect to a particular type of cognitive
phenomenon, then psychologists could justiﬁably generalize (in
only those particular domains, of course). We argue here that
such a pattern does emerge, if one carves up the space of cognitive
phenomena appropriately. More precisely, we suggest that there
is diversity in cognitive “contents” (broadly construed), but uni-
formity in learning “processes” (broadly construed).
Cognitive “phenomena” do not form a unitary type, as there is a
natural, defensible distinction between the cognitive “objects” of
the mind, and dynamic mental “processes.” Cognitive objects
include representations, knowledge structures, and so on. Mental
processes inﬂuence both those cognitive objects, and also other
processes. As one example of this distinction, there is a natural
difference between a concept and the processes by which one
learns that concept. Concepts are particular representations that
can be deployed in a range of circumstances; concept learning pro-
cesses are the means by which those representations emerge.
Importantly, the word process in our argument should explicitly
not be read as a synonym for “speciﬁc causal mechanism”; the dis-
tinction between a process and its “target” requires only a thin
notion of “process” (i.e.,somethinglike“if-then” rules, nota speciﬁc
neural mechanism). Furthermore, our argument does not depend
on the particular ways in which learning processes are instantiated
in different individuals, as long as those processes have the same
computational/psychological proﬁle.
We have no doubt that Henrich et al. are correct that there is
great diversity in representations, including people’s folk-biologi-
cal concepts, notions of “fairness” and “agency,” and moral con-
cepts. It is unsurprising that people who develop in different
environments – physical, mental, or social – develop different
representations of those environments. But diversity in represen-
tation does not imply diversity in learning processes. For
example, diversity in our learned concepts is arguably due to
differences in inputs, not differences in concept learning pro-
cesses. After all, the whole point of learning is that the same
process can produce very different outputs depending on the
environment, and thereby enable the organism to adapt to the
demands of an unpredictable or ever-changing environment.
There are thus prima facie reasons – genetic and evolutionary –
to think that there is likely to be uniformity in learning processes.
Of course, part of the point of Henrich et al.’s article is that we
ought not rest with the assertion that “there really ought to be
uniformity in learning processes”; instead, it is an empirical
matter as to whether there actually is such uniformity.
Determining whether learning processes are uniform across
both WEIRD and non-WEIRD individuals requires discovering
the learning processes in each individual, which is inevitably a
tricky matter. We can rarely (if ever) directly observe a learning
process; instead, we must ﬁnd its characteristics by determining
how the relevant cognitive objects change in response to different
inputs (either within- or between-participants). Despite these
difﬁculties, it is nonetheless often possible to learn about differ-
ent individuals’ learning processes. Unfortunately, as Henrich
et al.’s descriptive survey shows, there have been relatively few
cross-cultural studies of learning processes, as opposed to
representations or (relatively) automatic processing. By our
reading, essentially all of the phenomena that Henrich et al.
discuss
are
representations/contents,
rather
than
learning
processes. There are many psychological studies of learning
processes, but almost entirely restricted to WEIRD participants.
We must therefore look to more indirect evidence.
It is suggestive that many of the cases of cognitive uniformity
that Henrich et al. identify are also cases in which the environ-
ment is plausibly (relatively) uniform. On the “uniformity in
learning processes” view we advocate, one would predict this
sort of representational uniformity just when there is relative uni-
formity in the relevant environment. For example, it is (in our
view) unsurprising that the ability to pass the False Belief Task
emerges across cultures, since (presumably) all developing indi-
viduals have social environments that require interaction with
(and prediction of the behavior of) individuals with false beliefs.
Moreover, Henrich et al. themselves seem to assume uniform-
ity of learning processes in some of their explanations for diver-
sity. For example, they seem to endorse an explanation of
diversity in the Mu¨ller-Lyer illusion in terms of variation in the
visual environments of developing individuals. That is, Henrich
et al. seem to argue that differences in adult visual represen-
tations are due to differences in infant/child visual environments.
But implicit in this argument is an assumption that there is an
“infant environment ! adult visual representation” mapping
that is shared between both WEIRD and non-WEIRD individ-
uals. More generally, all explanations of diversity in terms of
environmental variation presuppose that there is relative uni-
formity in learning processes (in our thin sense). Explanations
based in environmental variation require some shared process
by which that variation can lead to behavioral or cognitive differ-
ences. If there is no shared learning process, then an appeal to
environmental differences is simply a non sequitur.

Learning processes (in a thin sense) are different from the
objects they inﬂuence, and this distinction can provide a basis
for when to expect uniformity and diversity in human cognition.
We suggest that uniformity should be expected for learning pro-
cesses, and diversity should be expected for objects whenever the
relevant learning environments differ (and there are no relevant,
direct selection pressures on the objects). We do not doubt that
people are more diverse than contemporary cognitive psychology
admits, and Henrich et al. do a great service in providing a
descriptive characterization of diversity. They simply paint with
too broad a methodological brush.

Getting beyond the “convenience sample” in
research on early cognitive development

Abstract: Research on the early development of fundamental cognitive
and language capacities has focused almost exclusively on infants from
middle-class families, excluding children living in poverty who may
experience less cognitive stimulation in the ﬁrst years of life. Ignoring
such differences limits our ability to discover the potentially powerful
contributions of environmental support to the ontogeny of cognitive
and language abilities.
Arnett (2008) blames the narrowness of American behavioral
research on a philosophy of science that focuses on universals in
human cognitive and social psychology, ignoring variability and
the factors that contribute to differences among people. Henrich
et al. share the concern that researchers in these areas simply
assume their ﬁndings are universal, but suggest that studies with
children may provide more convincing evidence. I do not think
that developmental psychologists should be let off the hook so
easily. If the WEIRD (Western, Educated, Rich, Industrialized,
and Democratic) sample that is studied so extensively in psycho-
logical research with adults consists of a privileged subset of 5%
of the world’s population, then the children represented in the bur-
geoning literatures on “core knowledge” (Spelke & Kinzler 2007)
and early language acquisition (Fernald & Marchman 2006) are
drawn from an even smaller sliver of afﬂuent and highly educated
families. Parents with the time, resources, and motivation to
bring their infant to participate in a developmental study at a uni-
versity laboratory are demographically even less diverse than the
college students who predominate in studies with adults.
Why does this matter? Because differences in socioeconomic
status (SES) are robustly associated with the quantity and
quality of early cognitive stimulation available to infants, and
early cognitive stimulation really does matter. Sixty years of devel-
opmental research show that parenting practices in infancy
mediate links between SES and long-term cognitive outcomes
(Hoff 2003; Milner 1951). Yet the hundreds of experiments in
recent years exploring basic cognitive capacities at younger and
younger ages have almost all focused on middle-class participants.
At the 2010 International Conference on Infant Studies, less than
1% of the 1,000 research presentations reported including partici-
pants from disadvantaged families, although 20–40% of children
in the United States are growing up in poverty (Wight et al. 2010).
If the same studies conducted in all those university research
centers were also run with infants in the lower-income neighbor-
hoods that are often just a few miles from campus, the results
would likely be different. We know, for example, that the
development of spatial abilities presumed to be species-speciﬁc
is compromised in low-SES children, who have less opportunity
to exercise spatial skills than do high-SES children who have
access to toys, puzzles, bikes, and the freedom to explore a safe
neighborhood (Levine et al. 2005). Yet developmental textbooks
abound with claims about how “infants’ awareness of physical
principles is evident at 3 months,” or how “infants use knowledge
of phonotactics to segment words by 7.5 months.” Such state-
ments may be true of the particular infants observed in the par-
ticular studies cited, but the results are often framed more
broadly, as if these speciﬁc ages characterize human infants uni-
versally and differences in early experience are simply irrelevant.
Would it matter if we discovered that these age-speciﬁc develop-
mental milestones are in fact only characteristic of infants in
middle-class families? If we found that infants living in poverty
are actually one or several months slower than higher-SES
infants to show evidence of “core knowledge of spatial relations”
or “speech segmentation ability”? It should matter, because to
ignore such differences is to ignore the potential role of environ-
mental support in the ontogeny of these critical capacities.
In our longitudinal research on the early development of ﬂuency
in language understanding,wehavefoundrobustrelationsbetween
verbal processing speed in infancy and long-term outcomes in both
high-SES English-learning children and low-SES Spanish-learning
children. In both groups, infants who are faster in speech proces-
sing at 18 months are more advanced on later cognitive and
language measures (Fernald et al. 2006; Hurtado et al. 2007). But
the differences in performance between these groups are stunning.
By 18 months, we ﬁnd that low-SES children are already substan-
tially slower in processing speed and vocabulary growth; and by the
age of 5 years, we see the gap in developmental measures found in
numerous studies since the 1960s (Ramey & Ramey 2004). This
inconvenient truth has forced us to re-evaluate the assumption
that our earlier research with children of afﬂuent families licensed
broad conclusions about the “speech processing abilities of 18- to
36-month-olds” in general, given that perfectly healthy 18- to 36-
month-olds from low-income families in the neighboring commu-
nity performed so differently on the same tasks.
But these ﬁndings have also led us to ask a question we had
previously ignored: Could it be that differences in early experi-
ence with language contribute to the variability observed in chil-
dren’s efﬁciency in real-time processing? It turns out that early
practice with language is inﬂuential in the development of
ﬂuency in understanding. In a study with low-SES families, we
found that those children whose mothers talked with them
more learned vocabulary more quickly – and they also made
more rapid gains in processing speed (Hurtado et al. 2008).
These results suggest that child-directed talk not only enables
faster learning of new vocabulary – it also sharpens the proces-
sing skills used in real-time interpretation of familiar words in
unfamiliar contexts, with cascading advantages for subsequent
learning. By examining variability both within and between
groups of children who differ in their early experience with
language, we gained insight into common developmental trajec-
tories of lexical growth in relation to increasing processing
efﬁciency, and also discovered environmental factors that may
enable some children to progress more rapidly than others.
Pinker (1994) once declared that “to a scientist interested in
how complex biological systems work, differences between indi-
viduals are so boring!” In fact, many biologists these days are
keenly interested in environmental inﬂuences on expression of
the genetic code during early development and the resulting phe-
notypic differences (Gottlieb 2007; Zhang & Meaney 2010). New
research on prenatal programming shows that fast- or slow-
growth trajectories set before birth have long-term developmental
consequences for health and vulnerability (Coe & Lubach 2008).
Developmental psychologists can now also address important
questions about the crucial inﬂuence of early postnatal experience
on cognition and language. But to do so we need to extend beyond
the WEIRD “convenience samples” we have traditionally relied

on, to examine trajectories of growth in broader populations of
children living in more diverse circumstances.
Cultural congruence between investigators
and participants masks the unknown
unknowns: Shame research as an example

Abstract: In addition to questions of the representativeness of Western,
educated samples vis-a`-vis the rest of humanity, the prevailing practice of
studying individuals who are culturally similar to the investigator entails
the problem that key features of the phenomena under investigation
may often go unrecognized. This will occur when investigators
implicitly rely on folk models that they share with their participants.
Henrich et al. present a compelling empirical case for a reduction
in the current reliance on participants from WEIRD societies in
the study of the human mind. Awareness of these facts should
motivate investigators both to recognize the need for caution in
inferring the generalizability of results derived from parochial
samples and to pursue more diverse samples, whether directly
or through collaborative networks. Here I wish to suggest that
additional impetus for such changes derives not simply from
questions of representativeness, but rather from the fact that
investigators themselves inevitably view the world through the
lens of their own culture.
As Henrich et al. observe, most psychological research is con-
ducted by members of WEIRD societies, hence investigators are
largely studying people very similar to themselves. By virtue of the
fact that they, too, are enculturated humans, investigators will
often share folk psychological models with participants drawn
from their own cultural group. Although rigorous science is always
based on the reﬁnement of models through hypothesis testing,
one has to begin somewhere, and I strongly suspect that social scien-
tists in general, and psychologists in particular, often rely on their
own folk models as a starting point in this process. When investi-
gators share fundamental cultural commonalities with their partici-
pants, they run the risk of overlooking key features of the
psychological phenomena at issue, as such features may be absent
from, or downplayed by, the given folk models (see Levy 1973).
In light of the above, it is interesting to consider a domain of
research only addressed in passing by Henrich et al., namely, the
study of emotions. Due, in part, to the centrality of claims regard-
ing innateness in a number of seminal modern investigations of
emotion, building on Darwin’s (1872) prior work on the subject,
the study of emotion has long included a substantial cross-cultural
component. From early on, cross-cultural research was employed
to explore both the recognizability of emotional expressions (e.g.,
Ekman & Friesen 1971) and the qualia and elicitors associated
with different emotions (e.g., Wallbott & Scherer 1986).
Despite thisemphasis,the relative neglect byprominentunivers-
alists of the importance of cultural meaning systems in the experi-
ence of emotion eventually led to bold claims by some cultural
constructionists (e.g., Lutz 1988), wherein a panhuman psychology
was seen as merely the seed from which radically diverse parochial
forms of emotion spring. As the ﬁeld matured further, polar differ-
ences between nativists and constructivists eventually dulled, with
various middle grounds being found, wherein investigators sought
to systematically examine the nature and extent of cultural variation
in the elicitors of emotions, the non-emotion correlates of cultural
variation in emotional experience, and similar facets (see, e.g.,
Kitayama & Markus 1994; Mesquita & Frijda 1992).
While the psychology of emotion would thus seem to be one
area where the call to action trumpeted by Henrich et al. has
already long been heard, even here one can ﬁnd signs of an
underestimation of the importance of moving beyond cultural
similarities between investigator and participant. For example,
a burgeoning literature (a keyword search in PsycINFO produces
almost 6,000 hits) explores shame. This literature focuses on
self-consciousness and issues of moral and personal worth, often
contrasting shame with guilt (see Tangney & Dearing 2002).
However, results obtained from a small-scale non-WEIRD
society, and hints provided by many non-Western languages’
emotion lexicons, suggest that, in addition to the aforementioned
features, for many of the world’s peoples, the emotion of shame
also encompasses what English speakers would call respect and
fear, facets that primarily concern subordinance in a hierarchy
rather than failure to conform to social standards (Fessler 2004).
Although the subordinance aspect of shame is absent from the
vast majority of the voluminous scholarly work on the subject,
with guidance, English-speaking participants generally recognize
this facet of shame in their own experiences. Importantly,
however, they do not volunteer this association on their own.
This is not surprising, given that Western folk models of shame
entirely
ignore
the
experience
of
subordinance,
perhaps
because this experience is arguably antithetical to the values
common in WEIRD groups. This leads to my central question,
namely, why have investigators not attended more to the subor-
dinance facet of shame?
I suspect that the problem is not merely that the participants
studied by many students of shame differ in important ways
from most of the world’s peoples, but also that the investigators
studying those participants consistently ﬁnd strong support for
their own intuitions, and hence see less need to cast a wide net
despite the history of cross-cultural research on emotions.
Whereas early work on emotions included places such as New
Guinea villages (Ekman & Friesen 1971), and recent work on
pride, directly relevant to understanding shame, has been con-
ducted in rural Burkina Faso (Tracy & Robins 2008), much
current work on shame is conﬁned to educated and afﬂuent
members of the state-level societies of North America, Western
Europe, and, to a lesser extent, East Asia. Importantly, failure to
recognize those aspects of shame that are downplayed or
ignored in their own culture limits investigators’ ability to
explain key features of the phenomena of interest. For example,
the behavioral tendencies for ﬂight and hiding so prominent in
the experience of shame seem odd in the context of a moral
emotion, but are readily understood once it is recognized that
this moral emotion is built upon a simpler emotion active in the
dangerous context of dominance negotiations (see Fessler 2007).
The take-home lesson here is that we must be particularly cau-
tious to avoid employing participants who are culturally similar to
ourselves whenever the given enterprise involves testing predic-
tions that resonate with our intuitions. Such samples are unlikely
to reveal to us that which we do not know that we do not know,
features that are masked by our own folk models.

Student subject pools can provide an invaluable benchmark for
investigating generalizability across different social groups or cultures.
In their excellent article, Henrich et al. rightly caution us to be
careful when we draw general conclusions from WEIRD
subject pools, of which undergraduates are the most frequently
used one, also in economics. My main comment is that the
right choice of subject pool is intimately linked to the research
question. Since the different behavioral sciences also have differ-
ent research questions, the right choice of subject pool will also
often be different across disciplines. In my own discipline, econ-
omics, students are actually often the best subject pool for quite a
few (fundamental) research questions. Here is why I believe so.
Economic theories normally do not come with assumptions (or
even caveats) about the restricted validity to only a speciﬁc group
of people; that is, they (implicitly) assume “generality.” Like the
assumption of selﬁshness, “generality” is a good assumption in
the absence of rigorous data. The tools of experimental econ-
omics have been deployed to investigate the empirical relevance
of the selﬁshness assumption (see, e.g., Fehr et al. 2002) and are
now also used to probe the “generality assumption,” that is, the
importance of variations of behavior across population subgroups
within a given society (e.g., Bellemare et al. 2008) or across
societies (e.g., Herrmann et al. 2008).
However, my main point is this: The “right choice” of subject
pool depends on the research question. If the researcher is inter-
ested in understanding behavioral variation between particular
groups of people, then the right choice is running experiments
with these people. The landmark study by Henrich et al.
(2005) is a shining example. Yet, at least in economics, substantial
effort is also devoted to test formal theories or to detect interest-
ing behavioral regularities (Bardsley et al. 2010; Croson &
Ga¨chter 2010; Smith 2010). Because economic theories normally
assume generality, any subject pool is in principle informative
about whether theoretical predictions or assumptions contain be-
havioral validity. At that stage, generalizability to other subject
pools is not (yet) an issue. Among the universe of potential
subject pools to test a theory, students are often the perfect
one: on average, students are educated, intelligent, and used to
learning. These are very valuable characteristics because, in
addition to the main aspect of a theory of interest to the
researcher, economic theories often assume cognitive sophisti-
cation. It therefore makes sense to control for sophistication
also by choice of subject pool (in addition to clear instructions),
in order to minimize chances of confounding genuine behavioral
reactions to the treatment of interest with lack of understanding
of the basic decision situation.
Take recent theories of social preferences (as surveyed, e.g., in
Fehr & Schmidt 2006) as an example. In addition to other-
regarding preferences, these theories all assume cognitive
sophistication. When testing these theories, the main point of
interest is not to ﬁnd out whether people are as cognitively soph-
isticated as the theories (maybe wrongly) assume, but to see to
what extent other-regarding motives exist, holding everything
else constant. Because students are typically above average
with regard to cognitive sophistication, they are often a perfect
subject pool for ﬁrst tests of a theory. Moreover, students,
unlike most other subject pools, are readily available (and cost
effective). Experiments can therefore also easily be replicated,
which is important to establish empirical regularity and hard to
achieve with any other subject pool.
Of course, strictly speaking, observed results hold only for
the subject pool from which evidence is collected. Generalizabil-
ity is a generic issue in any empirical research (Falk & Heckman
2009). However, once a clear benchmark result is established,
we can proceed by testing, for example, how age and life
experience matter (e.g., Sutter & Kocher 2007b), or how
results extend to more representative subject pools (e.g., Belle-
mare et al. 2008; Carpenter et al. 2008). Along the way, research-
ers often establish whether and how students differ from the
general population.
As Henrich et al. point out, understanding the potential inﬂu-
ence of cross-societal (or cultural) differences in (economic)
behavior is a particularly interesting direction for investigating
generalizability. But it poses further challenges, in particular if
socio-demographic factors matter (as some of the above-cited
research suggests). The reason is that socio-demographic inﬂu-
ences might be confounded with genuine societal or cultural
differences. The problem is exacerbated the more subject pools
are actually being compared. Again, to ensure that confounds
are minimized, student subject pools are often the best available
choice (Bohnet et al. 2008; Herrmann et al. 2008) to establish a
clean benchmark result on how people from different societal/
cultural backgrounds behave in the exact same decision situ-
ation – a fundamental question from the generality perspective
of economics. The benchmark can – and should(!) – then be
taken as a starting point for investigating generalizability to
other social groups.

Abstract: We dispute Henrich et al.’s analysis of cultural differences at
the level of a narrow behavioral-expression for assessing a universalist
argument.
When
Researchers
Overlook
uNderlying
Genotypes
(WRONG), they fail to detect universal processes that generate
observed differences in expression. We reify this position with our own
cross-cultural research on self-enhancement and self-esteem.
We dispute the level of analysis Henrich et al. have employed to
conclude that members of Western, Educated, Industrialized,
Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) societies are non-representative
of the human species and to determine, more generally, whether
an observed cultural difference contradicts a universalist argu-
ment. Borrowing from the biological lexicon, our position is as
follows: Analysis of difference at the level of a narrow phenotypic
behavioral-expression precludes detection of human universals
that operate at the level of an abstract genotypic process.
Stated otherwise, When Researchers Overlook uNderlying
Genotypes (our acronym WRONG), they will fail to detect
universal processes that generate observed differences in
expression (Kobayashi & Brown 2003). We ﬁrst frame our pos-
ition with an example and then reify our position with our own
cross-cultural research on self-enhancement and self-esteem –
phenomena from which Henrich et al. derived their WEIRD
conclusion.
The human diet exempliﬁes our position (Sedikides & Gregg
2008). When considered at the narrow level of observed behav-
ior, human societies appear extraordinarily different in regard
to what they eat (e.g., a Kosher diet precludes pork; a Jain diet
is vegetarian). When considered more broadly, however, the
diverse diets are connected and assimilated by a universal need
for sustenance. It would be faulty indeed to conclude that the
need for sustenance is less pronounced, if not absent, in one

society because it consumes less, if not any, of the foods con-
sumed by another society – what is consumed depends on
factors such as climate and custom. Our point, of course, is
that human universals operate at the abstract level of process-
and-function, and the expression of the universal emerges in con-
junction with contextual considerations (Schlenker 1974).
To be clear, we do not oppose the study of concrete behavior.
Cataloguing behavioral differences across societies certainly con-
tributes to understanding the human condition. However, the
presence of a behavioral difference per se is not evidence con-
trary to a universalist argument. The necessary consideration is
whether the observed difference is produced by a process or
function common across societies.
Henrich et al. suggest that WEIRD societies are peculiar, in
part, because they uniquely possess positive self-views. Such a
conclusion, however, is a consequence of the WRONG strategy.
Our own cross-cultural programs of research on the self-enhance-
ment motive (i.e., need to maintain a positive sense of self) and
self-esteem (i.e., an affective self-evaluation) indicate that a posi-
tive self-view is a human tendency.
Our primary studies and meta-analytic syntheses indicate that
both Westerners and Easterners self-enhance, but they do so on
different attribute dimensions.1 Westerners self-enhance (i.e.,
deem self as superior to peers) on attributes relevant to individu-
alism, and Easterners self-enhance on attributes relevant to col-
lectivism. This is because Westerners deem individualism, and
Easterners deem collectivism, as important. Here a common
process (self-enhancing on important attributes) is differentially
expressed (individualism vs. collectivism), because culture
affects the expression, not the presence, of the enhancement
motive (Brown & Kobayashi 2002; Sedikides et al. 2003; Sedi-
kides et al. 2005; 2007a; 2007b). Furthermore, that common
process has the same functional association with psychological
adjustment in both cultures: Self-enhancing on important attri-
butes promotes better adjustment (e.g., greater well-being, less
depression,) among Easterners and Westerners (Gaertner et al.
2008; Kobayashi & Brown 2003; O’Mara et al. 2009). Therefore,
when assessed at the abstract level of process and function,
members of WEIRD societies are quite normal in their striving
for a positive self-view.
As Henrich et al. suggest, Eastern samples typically provide
lower explicit reports of self-esteem than do Western samples
(Heine et al. 1999). Such explicit reports, however, are compro-
mised by a pervasive modesty norm in Eastern cultures (Brown,
in press; Kurman 2003). Indeed, the cultural differences occur in
reports of cognitive self-evaluation, not affective self-regard, and
these differences vanish when modesty is statistically controlled
(Cai et al. 2007). Similarly, cultural differences in self-esteem
vanish when self-esteem is assessed with implicit measures that
circumvent modesty norms (e.g., Yamaguchi et al. 2007). Fur-
thermore, self-esteem reveals the same functional patterns
across cultures. Self-esteem predicts greater well-being and
lower depression in the East (Cai et al. 2009), just as it does in
the West (Taylor & Brown 1988). Likewise, self-esteem bolsters
against threats to self-worth in both cultures such that failure
feedback more strongly erodes immediate feelings of worth for
low rather than high self-esteem persons (Brown et al. 2009).
Hence, when assessed at the abstract level of process and func-
tion, members of WEIRD societies are quite normal in their
possession of a positive-self view.
In summary, testing human universals at the level of narrow
behavioral differences between societies is the WRONG strat-
egy. Human universals operate at the abstract level of process
and function, and such universals can generate observed differ-
ences. We conclude with application of our argument to the
man-to-boy insemination rituals of New Guinea with which
Henrich et al. began their article. At the narrow level of the
observed behavior, the rituals seem bizarre in regard to
WEIRD standards. When considered more abstractly in terms
of process or function (i.e., a social practice marking a boy’s
passage to manhood), the rituals connect with coming-of-age
rituals practiced in other societies, such as the Bar and Bat
Mitzvah, Credo-baptism, Debutante Ball, and Sweet Sixteen.
The observed behaviors certainly differ, but the underlying
psychological process is the same.

research?
A
sample
of
564,502
participants completed a personality questionnaire online. We found
that 19% were not from advanced economies; 20% were from non-
Western societies; 35% of the Western-society sample were not from
the United States; and 66% of the U. S. sample were not in the 18–22
(college) age group.
Henrich et al. show that the vast majority of research in the be-
havioral sciences continues to be based on populations the
authors call WEIRD because they are unlikely to be representa-
tive of humankind. Even more alarmingly, much of the research
published in top-tier journals is not even representative of the
populations in WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized,
Rich, and Democratic) countries. For example, in the 510
samples published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psy-
chology (JPSP) in 2002, 85% of them were student samples,
71% of the participants were female, more than 80% were
white, and the mean age was 22.9 years (Gosling et al. 2004).
What should we do about this? Henrich et al. conclude their
article by urging institutions to improve the infrastructure for col-
lecting data from non-WEIRD samples as well as the incentives
for studying them. However, Henrich et al. offer very little in the
way of concrete practical suggestions for expanding the reach of
research in the behavioral sciences.
We propose that the Internet holds great promise for broaden-
ing the participant base of research in the behavioral sciences
(Gosling & Johnson 2010; Reis & Gosling 2010). Using the Inter-
net, researchers can deliver to participants a broad range of
graphics, photographs, and dynamic media (Krantz & Williams
2010); obtain informant reports (Vazire 2010); and administer
surveys (Tuten 2010), questionnaires (Johnson 2010), ability
tests (Schroeders et al. 2010), and experiments (Reips &
Krantz 2010). Participants can be randomly assigned to exper-
imental conditions, reaction times can be measured, and a
broad range of incentives for participation can be offered
(Go¨ritz 2010).
Internet methods offer researchers many advantages over tra-
ditional methods in terms of improved efﬁciency, accuracy, cost
effectiveness, and reach (Gosling & Johnson 2010; Gosling
et al. 2004; Reis & Gosling 2010). But how do Internet samples
fare regarding Henrich et al.’s concerns about generalizability
and representativeness? We do know that Internet samples are

generally more diverse than the “traditional” samples in the top
psychology journals with respect to gender, socioeconomic
status, geographic region, and age (Gosling et al. 2004). But do
such samples offer any hope of reaching the kinds of participants
that Henrich et al. rightly note are so under-represented in the
behavioral sciences?
To ﬁnd out, we examined a dataset of personality question-
naires collected in Dutch, English, German, or Spanish via the
Internet in 2009 (for details of the method, see Srivastava et al.
2003). We examined only those 564,502 participants (81%)
who had indicated the country in which they resided and were
aged between 9 and 90. We followed the four contrasts used
by Henrich et al.: (1) people from modern industrialized societies
versus small-scale societies; (2) people from Western societies
versus non-Western industrialized societies; (3) people from
the United States versus other Western societies; and (4) univer-
sity-educated versus nonuniversity-educated people from the
United States.
With respect to the ﬁrst comparison, our sample almost cer-
tainly fails to capture individuals living in small-scale societies,
which is unsurprising given the written format and the languages
used. So to provide some insight into the extent to which Internet
samples capture participants beyond modern industrialized
societies, we examined the percentage of our participants who
were from the 34 countries classiﬁed by the International Mon-
etary Fund (IMF) as “advanced economies” (WEO Groups and
Aggregates Information 2009): 19% (N ¼ 104,928) were not
from these advanced economies.
With respect to the second contrast, we found that 20%
(N ¼ 111,962) of the sample were from non-Western societies
(i.e., not from North America, Israel, Australia, New Zealand,
and Western Europe). With respect to the third contrast,
within these Western societies, 35% (N ¼ 158,300) were not
from the United States.
With respect to the fourth contrast, we did not have infor-
mation on whether the participants were college students.
However, we do know that 66% (N ¼ 369,916) of the sample
(who ranged in age between 9 and 90) were not from the 18 to
22 age group that characterizes the vast majority of college stu-
dents. With respect to diversity in terms of ethnicity, a substantial
41% were non-white.
All four contrasts suggest that Internet samples are not as
dominated by WEIRD participants as are samples currently pub-
lished in behavioral science journals. Moreover, even though the
percentages of non-WEIRD participants in the Internet samples
may seem modest, Internet methods permit the collection of
large samples, so the absolute sample sizes of non-Weird partici-
pants can be quite impressive. For example, although the sample
was predominantly North American (52% from the United States
and 5% from Canada), the sample represented a breadth of geo-
graphic regions from around the world: 111 countries, from
Albania (N ¼ 215) to Venezuela (N ¼ 1,920), were represented
in the sample by at least 100 participants each.
Our data were collected using a website that did not speciﬁ-
cally target non-WEIRD samples and used Western languages
(Dutch, English, German, Spanish) predominant in WEIRD
countries; thus, the ﬁndings almost certainly underestimate the
percentages of non-WEIRD participants that could be obtained
in
studies
targeting
non-WEIRD
participants
and
using
languages common in non-WEIRD samples.
Like all methods, Internet-based methods are subject to limit-
ations. The samples are certainly not representative of human-
kind, participants must have access to the Internet and know
how to use a Web browser, and some studies cannot be delivered
online (Johnson & Gosling 2010). However, the global spread of
Web access will diminish the sampling biases. Moreover, current
infrastructure and technology already provide the means for dis-
tributing compensation to participants (e.g., via Amazon.com’s
Mechanical Turk) and for accessing populations that do not
have their own Web access (e.g., via laptop computers, tablets,
and smart-phones administered by local research assistants,
even those with minimal technical knowledge).
No single method can rectify the ﬁeld’s over-reliance on
WEIRD samples. However, Internet methods are one promising
tool that should be used in combination with others to combat
the problem of WEIRD research. Our analyses suggest that
Internet samples can help ameliorate the biases found in
typical research samples and can help wean WEIRD researchers
off WEIRD samples.

Abstract:
Motor
development – traditionally
studied
in
WEIRD
populations – falls victim to assumptions of universality similar to other
domains described by Henrich et al. However, cross-cultural research
illustrates the extraordinary diversity that is normal in motor skill
acquisition. Indeed, motor development provides an important domain
for evaluating cultural challenges to a general behavioral science.
Henrich et al. remind us, like others before (e.g., Bornstein 1980;
Graham 1992; Kennedy et al. 1984; Moghaddam 1987; Parke
2000; Russell 1984; Sexton & Misiak 1984; Triandis 1980),
about the formative role of culture in all human behavior.
Even basic psychological processes such as perception are
subject to cultural variation (Segall et al. 1966). Nonetheless,
psychological research remains largely ethnocentric.
Consider basic processes in motor development. Cross-cul-
tural comparisons serve as natural experiments revealing the
effects of experience on motor development and highlighting
diversity in developmental pathways and the range in human
potential (Adolph et al. 2010; Bornstein 1995). Yet, the ﬁeld
suffers from long-standing assumptions of universality based on
norms established with WEIRD populations.
Historically, research on motor development focused on estab-
lishing universals. Led by Gesell, early pioneers established the
practice of cataloging the ages and stages of motor development.
In particular, Gesell’s (1928) testing procedures, test items, and
developmental norms – explicitly and deliberately based on
behaviors of WEIRD children – inspired the widely used
Bayley (1969) and Denver Scales (Frankenburg & Dodds
1967), which describe the developmental timing and sequence
of infants’ motor skills. Such normative templates are the
current, accepted gold standard of motor development, and are
regarded as prescriptions of what is desired, rather than relatively
narrow descriptions of what may be acquired.
Due to the prevailing emphasis on motor milestones, cross-
cultural research has been dominated by normative comparisons
of onset ages. Recent evidence shows that cultural differences in
daily childrearing practices can explain accelerated and delayed
onset ages relative to WEIRD norms (see Adolph et al. 2010,
for a review). For example, in some regions of Africa, the Carib-
bean, and India, caregivers vigorously massage and exercise
infants as part of daily bathing routines, stretching infants’
limbs, tossing them into the air, and propping them into sitting
and walking positions (Bril 1988; Super 1976). Infants who

receive massage and exercise begin sitting and walking at earlier
ages than infants who do not (Hopkins & Westra 1988). Labora-
tory experiments with random assignment to exercise and control
groups conﬁrm these results: A few minutes of daily exercise
accelerates walking onset (Zelazo 1983).
Reciprocally, restricted practice can delay the age at which
children reach motor milestones. In Northern China, the
practice of toileting infants by laying them on their backs in
sandbags for most of the day delays the onset of sitting, crawling,
and walking by several months (Mei 1994). Among WEIRD
families, the recent practice of putting infants to sleep on their
backs rather than their stomachs has resulted in delayed
onset of crawling and other prone skills (Davis et al. 1998). In
cultures that do not encourage crawling (including WEIRD
infants circa 1900), large proportions of infants skip crawling
altogether (Hopkins & Westra 1988), either bum-shufﬂing or
proceeding straight to walking (Fox et al. 2002; Robson 1984;
Trettien 1900).
Other aspects of motor development are also inﬂuenced by
culture and context. For example, childrearing practices can
affect the shape of developmental trajectories. In WEIRD cul-
tures, upright leg movements show a well-known U-shaped tra-
jectory: Newborn stepping disappears after about 2 months of
age and upright stepping does not return until the end of the
ﬁrst year. But in cultures where caregivers exercise infants’ leg
movements (and this is conﬁrmed in laboratory experiments),
stepping shows monotonic increase throughout the ﬁrst year
(Super 1976; Zelazo 1983).
Foot-binding in China provides an extreme example of how
cultural practices affect the form of movements. For 1,000
years, mothers deformed their daughters’ feet to give them the
walking gait of a “tender young willow shoot in a spring
breeze” (Chew 2005). Feet 3 inches in length were achieved
through years of training and excruciating pain. The routine
(typically beginning between 5 and 8 years of age) involved
breaking four toes on each foot and bending and tightening
them in place with bandages. Girls then relearned how to walk
with altered balance constraints of their shortened feet. This
custom was eradicated in the 1920s.
Cultural practices also affect the endpoint of development.
Daily tasks require peoples of Africa, Asia, and North America
to develop walking and running skills that exceed the abilities
of WEIRD adults. African women and Nepalese porters of
both genders carry immense loads by modifying their walking
gait to conserve mechanical energy (Heglund et al. 1995). They
routinely carry more than their body weight for many kilometers
(Bastien et al. 2005). Tarahumaran Indian children, women, and
men of Mexico run 150 to 300 kilometers round-the-clock for fun
and for persistence hunting (Bennett & Zingg 1935). Endpoints
can also stop short of what is expected. Crawling on hands and
feet before walking is typical in WEIRD infants, but some
families of adults in rural Turkey crawl on hands and feet
instead of walking (Humphrey et al. 2005). In contrast to most
cultures, the parents of these adult children never encouraged
walking, and the primary models for locomotion were siblings
who also crawled instead of walked.
Henrich et al. raise an important point about commonalities
across cultures with different childrearing practices. Basic
motor functions – manual, postural, and locomotor skills – that
are universally useful and adaptive are present in every society
studied. We are comparing the postural and manual capacities
of 5-month-olds in disparate cultures on maternal handling prac-
tices (Karasik et al. 2010). Despite different support contexts,
infants practice various postures with accompanying opportu-
nities for object exploration. These data highlight developmental
equiﬁnality (Bornstein 1995): Although the routes to object
exploration vary, the outcome is the same.
Cross-cultural research on motor development is important
for establishing general principles in developmental science
and for revealing possibilities in human development hitherto
unimagined. WEIRD infants sit at 6 months, but African
infants sit at 4 months. WEIRD mothers would never dream of
leaving their young infants unattended, but mothers in Camer-
oon leave their 5-month-olds (for 20þ minutes!) sitting alone
on high stools. These sorts of phenomena can only be revealed
with cross-cultural work providing the impetus for laboratory
investigations to consider and test hypotheses previously not
envisioned.
The socio-ecological approach turns variance
among populations from a liability to an asset

Abstract: We emphasize the value of the socio-ecological approach in
addressing the problem of population variances. The socio-ecological
perspective studies how social and natural habitats shape human
behaviors, and are in turn shaped by those behaviors. This focus on
system-level factors is particularly well-suited to studying the origins of
group differences in human behavior.
The target article persuasively demonstrates the perils of build-
ing and testing psychological theories almost exclusively on
Western,
Educated,
Industrialized,
Rich,
and
Democratic
(WEIRD) people. We wholeheartedly agree that knowledge
based on WEIRD samples is limited at best and misleading at
worst. The authors’ plea for broadening the knowledge base of
psychological science is valid, timely, and of prime importance
for the future development of psychological and behavioral
sciences.
Whereas the authors’ main recommendation for a better
science is to sample participants strategically from diverse popu-
lations, we recommend an additional research strategy based on a
socio-ecological perspective. Just as ecological biologists study
animals’ behaviors in relation to their natural habitats (e.g.,
Stutchbury & Morton 2001), socio-ecological psychologists
study how natural and social habitats affect human mind and be-
havior. The ﬁrst step we recommend is, instead of dismissing the
research on WEIRD people, to consider the simple yet critical
question of “Why are WEIRD people so weird to begin with?”
Once potential explanations are considered, researchers can go
on to systematically test these potential causes of human diversity
in mind and behavior as the second step.
There already are several recent studies using a socio-ecologi-
cal perspective that provide important clues as to why WEIRD
people are so different from non-WEIRD people, and what
factors might cause diversity in mind and behavior (see Oishi
& Graham, in press, for a review). Fincher et al. (2008), for
example, wondered why nations, and indeed, regions, vary on
individualism versus collectivism (with the former being typical
of WEIRD countries). They showed that historically low levels
of pathogen prevalence might be one reason – people in
nations with low pathogen prevalence do not need to draw
sharp ingroup-outgroup distinctions the way people do in
nations with high pathogen prevalence. Similarly, Kitayama
et al. (2006) wondered about the origins of rugged individualism
in the United States, and hypothesized that it is in part due to the
history of the frontier spirit. They found that people in Hokkaido,
the northern island of Japan with a history of frontier spirit,
showed a greater degree of American-style individualism than
did mainland Japanese who don’t have such a history.

Oishi and colleagues (Oishi et al. 2007; 2009a) likewise won-
dered why Americans typically deﬁne themselves in terms of per-
sonality traits, skills, and abilities rather than collective attributes
(Markus & Kitayama 1991) and show conditional group identiﬁ-
cation (Cialdini et al. 1976). They demonstrated that high resi-
dential mobility might be partly responsible for such patterns
of self-concepts and group identiﬁcation (see Oishi, in press,
for review). Uskul et al. (2008) speculated that the degree of
economic interdependence might be in part responsible for ana-
lytic thinking dominant in the United States. They examined
whether herders (who are economically independent) would
show a greater degree of analytic tendency than farmers and ﬁsh-
ermen (who are more dependent on others in their economic
activities) in the same single region of Turkey. Indeed, they
found that Turkish herders showed more analytic tendencies
than did farmers and ﬁshermen. Likewise, Yamagishi et al.
(2008) hypothesized that preference for unique choice (Kim &
Markus 1999) among Americans is due in part to open as
opposed to closed social systems, and they demonstrated that
this was indeed the case. Finally, one of the target article
authors’ own seminal research (see Henrich et al. 2005) has
importantly shown that market integration and payoffs to
cooperation in daily economic activities predicted cross-societal
variations in behavioral responses in the Ultimatum Game.
A socio-ecological perspective may help us to understand not
only cross-societal variation, but variation within WEIRD popu-
lations, too. For example, mean punishment expenditures from
the Public Goods Game described in the target article’s
Figure 4 show high diversity within WEIRD samples: The
United States and Australia are at one end and Germany and
Denmark are at the other end. The socio-ecological perspective
helps us to generate various hypotheses regarding this variation.
For instance, the United States and Australia are nations high in
residential mobility, whereas Germany and Denmark are nations
low in residential mobility. Could these within-WEIRD vari-
ations be the result of societal differences in residential mobility
(and temporariness of group membership)? If so, would there be
a comparable within-nation variation in punishment behaviors
between residentially mobile cities (e.g., Atlanta) and residen-
tially stable cities (e.g., Philadelphia), a within-city variation
between residentially mobile people and stable people, and
even a within-person variation between the times when people
are thinking about moving and the times they are thinking
about staying? In the area of self-concept and conditional
group identiﬁcation, Oishi and colleagues have found such
within-society variations as well as cross-society variations (see
Oishi, in press, for review).
We are of course not claiming that all variation between
human populations is due to socio-ecological factors. There is
no doubt that biological and evolutionary forces also play an
important role. However, a socio-ecological perspective does
provide a concrete framework for searching for the causes of
diversity and universality of mind and behavior.
In conclusion, we agree that psychological knowledge should
not be solely based on WEIRD people. We also agree with
Henrich et al. that it is important to include large and diverse
samples in our science. We recommend two additional steps
for researchers. First, ask the simple, yet important question of
“Why are WEIRD people so weird?” Second, test whether any
potential socio-ecological factors that might make WEIRD
people weird account for societal, regional, and individual vari-
ations in a broad array of phenomena central to human psychol-
ogy. These two additional steps are critical because they can
convert the research on limited WEIRD samples from a major
liability (as the authors suggest) to a major asset from which we
can build and develop the type of psychological and behavioral
sciences that the authors promote in their target article – the
psychological and behavioral sciences that illuminate the causes
of universality and diversity in mind and behavior. Instead of dis-
missing the research based on WEIRD people, we can start a
better science from it! We believe that a socio-ecological
perspective is particularly helpful to this end.

Abstract: Henrich et al. address how culture leads to cognitive variability
and recommend that researchers be critical about the samples they
investigate. However, there are other sources of variability, such as
individual strategies in reasoning and the content and context on which
processes operate. Because strategy and content drive variability, those
factors are of primary interest, while culture is merely incidental.
Henrich et al.’s thought-provoking article discusses two major
issues – how psychologists should pursue research, and how
culture leads to cognitive variability. In what follows, we
address these issues in turn, and argue that any cognitive
theory ought to account for not only culture, but also other
sources of cognitive variability.
First, Henrich et al. compare empirical data obtained from
individual samples that fall under the umbrella description
WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialised, Rich, and Demo-
cratic) with those obtained elsewhere, and draw the conclusion
that “WEIRD subjects may often be the worst population from
which to make generalizations” (sect. 7.1.2). For example, they
report that people in many non-Western samples do not experi-
ence the Mu¨ller-Lyer illusion as strongly as do Americans, and
query that “if visual perception can vary, what kind of psychologi-
cal processes can we be sure will not vary?” (sect. 3.1, para. 5).
However, while Henrich et al. caution against making sweeping
generalizations from limited sets of data, they do not explain
why they are permitted to make sweeping generalizations of rela-
tivism from their own data – the Mu¨ller-Lyer illusion is but one
single phenomenon in visual perception, hardly representative of
all visual perceptual processes. What would count as a represen-
tative sample of human psychology? The assertion that WEIRD
participants are least representative of human psychology implies
that there is a more representative sample, but Henrich et al.
have failed to specify it. We believe that such a speciﬁcation
can only be arrived at empirically, and that it is impossible to
specify a priori what a representative sample of human cognition
should be.
Psychological research is theory-driven. Hence, in the absence
of any evidence or theoretical rationale suggesting otherwise,
WEIRD samples are a convenient proxy for conducting research,
and they allow researchers to draw tentative conclusions about
the matter of investigation. We acknowledge that certain speciﬁc
psychological phenomena observed in WEIRD samples may not
occur in other populations, and such discrepancies may help
researchers make more accurate predictions in future exper-
iments. Henrich et al.’s results underline the point that tentative
conclusions are needed in order to support or contravene a
theory.
Second, Henrich et al. have identiﬁed culture as a major
source of cognitive variability, but we believe it is important to
Commentary/Henrich et al.: The weirdest people in the world?
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:2/3
37

----- Page 38 (native) -----
examine other sources of variability, as well. Cognitive processes
are by nature non-deterministic: Children do not employ a deter-
ministic strategy to perform cognitive tasks (e.g., Siegler 1996),
and patients with dementia, head injury, ADHD, and schizo-
phrenia are even less consistent in their thinking (for a review,
see MacDonald et al. 2006). Likewise, the same individual may
perform a task differently at different times. In one of our
studies (Bucciarelli & Johnson-Laird 1999), a group of partici-
pants had to draw deductions from syllogistic premises by
using cut-out paper shapes representing syllogistic terms.
Results showed that individuals’ strategies differed from trial to
trial in terms of which premises to interpret ﬁrst, how to interpret
the premises, and how to diligently search for counterexamples.
As a result, it was impossible to predict individuals’ cognitive
operations based on their previous performance.
What other sorts of factors affect the way we think? Matura-
tional and psychopathological factors are clear determinants,
but the content on which a cognitive process operates may
affect the process itself. Individuals think about different con-
tents because they differ in their experiences, education, and
beliefs. Culture may explain variability in these factors only to a
certain extent, and hence psychologists ought to develop theories
that explain how a cognitive process (a) can be modulated by
content, and (b) develops and decays under normal and patho-
logical conditions, respectively.
Consider the case of bicultural individuals. The behaviour of
these individuals is guided by one internalized culture or the
other at different moments (e.g., Ng & Lai 2009; Pouliasi & Ver-
kuyten 2007), and they organize their cultural identities differ-
ently (Haritatos & Benet-Martı´nez 2002). When bicultural
individuals’ cultures contain inconsistent moral values, they will
experience moral dilemmas such as the following described by a
19-year-old second-generation Indian American: “I enjoy my
Indian culture, I feel that it is rich in tradition, morality, and
beauty; confused because I have been in many situations where
I feel being both cultures is not an option . . . I feel like you
have to choose one or the other” (Haritatos & Benet-Martı´nez
2002). How might a theory explain this phenomenon? Mental
models theory (e.g., Johnson-Laird 2006) allows for individuals
to entertain inconsistent beliefs, because we tend to rely on separ-
ate sets of beliefs in separate contexts (Johnson-Laird et al. 2000).
This is evident in moral reasoning, in which moral intuitions and
conscious moral reasoning are based on beliefs that are neither
complete nor consistent (Bucciarelli et al. 2008). Our conception
of culture therefore differs from that in cross-cultural psychology,
which considers culture as a network of discrete, speciﬁc con-
structs that guide cognition only when they come to the fore-
ground in an individual’s mind (Hong et al. 2000).
How do cross-cultural differences in thinking emerge in a
society? Henrich et al. explain the development of these differ-
ences by appealing to content (data perceived, norms, and con-
notations) and context (individuals’ contemporary environment,
the environment during development, and the immediate exper-
imental environment). We emphasize that an analysis of reason-
ing strategies can explain variability within the same individual.
Therefore, if content, context, and strategy drive cultural differ-
ences, then those factors are of primary interest, whereas cultural
differences are merely incidental. Cognitive theories should dis-
tinguish between the universal processes they propose and the
speciﬁc contents on which they operate. For instance, our own
theory of moral reasoning (Bucciarelli et al. 2008) posits that
moral reasoning is simply normal deontic reasoning (Bucciarelli
& Johnson-Laird 2005) applied to moral contents and contexts.
Moral contents and contexts may differ across cultures, but the
theory of deontic reasoning we propose is, and ought to be,
domain-general. Such a dissociation between general compu-
tational operations and the contents they operate on allows
researchers to construct theories that are sensitive not just to
cultural differences, but to age-related, social, personality, and
strategic differences, as well.
Responsible behavioral science
generalizations and applications require much
more than non-WEIRD samples

Abstract:
There
are
many
methodological
considerations – some
intricately associated with the use of WEIRD samples – that adversely
affect external validity as much as, or even more than, unrepresentative
sampling does. Among suspect applications, especially worrisome is the
incorporation of WEIRD-based ﬁndings regarding moral reasoning and
retribution into normative expectations, such as might be held by
international criminal tribunals in “cognitively distant” war-torn areas.
The article by Henrich et al. is a valuable contribution that goes
beyond prior critiques of the deplorable lack of representative-
ness of a large proportion of participant samples that have
been used in the behavioral sciences. The cogency of argumenta-
tion, and both the breadth and the detail of the empirical docu-
mentation that is provided, are impressive. Therefore, my
commentary will not challenge the main thesis proposed by
Henrich et al. Instead, its purpose is to supplement and increase
the scope of their article’s argument.
An important, although perhaps self-evident, observation is
that the authors’ thesis concerning WEIRD samples would be
even more useful (perhaps considerably more so) had they at
least mentioned and brieﬂy outlined some other factors – often
closely, and sometimes unavoidably, associated with the research
designs using WEIRD samples – which may even more detri-
mentally affect the generalizability (external validity) of the
results than does the lack of WEIRD samples’ representativeness.
An abbreviated list of such factors will have to sufﬁce here: unre-
presentative sets of independent variables; artiﬁciality of research
settings; a limited number of tasks (often a single task) through
which the independent variables are presented; and relying on a
single data-collection method (such as questionnaires, surveys,
or rating scales) – and therefore obtaining a single dependent
measure (or an uninformatively correlated set of measures) that
is often qualitatively different from the one to which generalization
is sought in the “real world.” The mentioned factors are highly rel-
evant for a more complete understanding of the issues in some of
the areas discussed in the target article, especially fairness and
cooperation, punishment of “excessive” cooperators, personal
choice, “fundamental attribution error,” and moral reasoning.
Moreover, one must worry about the (statistical) interaction of
the effect of WEIRD samples’ uniqueness (extremity, non-modal
character) with the effects of these additional factors (e.g., the fre-
quently highly artiﬁcial tasks), such that the overall result
(especially when interactions are of a multiplicative form) would
be even more misleading with regard to some real-world criterion
and domain of desired application than is the case on the basis of
WEIRD samples’ “differentness” alone. On the other hand, if, for
example, a greater variety of tasks were used, the presently
observed
differences
between
WEIRD
and
various
non-
WEIRD samples might in some cases disappear. One simply
cannot predict what would happen without doing the research.
The above family of methodological observations has its root in
the pioneering work of Campbell and colleagues (e.g., Campbell
& Stanley 1963; Webb et al. 1966). Among the subsequent empiri-
cal demonstrations of some of the underlying principles were the
studies by Ebbesen and Konecˇni: for example, of decisions under
risk (in automobile driving; e.g., Ebbesen et al. 1977; Konecˇni
et al. 1976) and of key decisions by judges, prosecutors, and other
participants in the criminal justice system (Konecˇni & Ebbesen
1982b). An important aspect of this work has been the mustering

of the theoretical and empirical support for the idea of validated
simulations in behavioral science (Konecˇni & Ebbesen 1992).
Among the judicial decisions studied in this research program
were those of the setting of bail and, especially, the sentencing of
felons (e.g., Ebbesen & Konecˇni 1975; Konecˇni & Ebbesen
1982a). This work utilized both WEIRD and non-WEIRD samples
(as in the fourth “telescoping contrast” in Henrich et al.; see sect.
6) and supports the target article’s skepticism. Moreover, a more
general, but logical, extension is to question the applicability of
WEIRD-based ﬁndings regarding aggressiveness, retribution, fair-
nessandequity,andmoralreasoningingeneral(cf.sect.4.4.)tointer-
national law. Here the most troubling possibility is the deliberate or
unconscious incorporation of WEIRD-based ﬁndings into the nor-
mative expectations held by international bodies in “cognitively
distant” war-torn areas – such as in Rwanda by the United Nations
AssistanceMissionforRwandaandtheInternationalCriminalTribu-
nal for Rwanda. What must be very carefully taken into account are
not only the enormous complexities of ancient tribal relations, but
also those stemming from massive religious conversions by some of
the warring parties under an external oppressor (as in Bosnia and
Herzegovina, another internationally adjudicated conﬂict).
In sum, there is far more to external validity than the unrepresen-
tativeness of samples. The only truly solid reason to trust an exper-
imental
simulation
(especially
one
that
potentially
involves
enormous human costs) is to have had it validated by means of
careful successive approximations to the real world, each step
moving closer to the actual real-world phenomenon – not just with
different participant samples, but also guided by a multi-method X
multi-dependent-measure matrix (Konecˇni & Ebbesen 1992).
Some additional observations arein order. Just as Nature Genetics
requires all empirical papers to include data from two independent
samples (target article, sect. 6.2, para. 3), the Journal of Personality
and Social Psychology, for example, might begin to require not just
the use of at least two different methods in the laboratory, but also
both laboratory and ﬁeld research – before researchers move away
from psychology freshmen. If this were required, it seems likely
that some “cute,” supposedly counterintuitive, task-speciﬁc effects
(including in the area of heuristics and biases) would not be repli-
cated evenwithdifferentWEIRDsamples.I am notasfavorably dis-
posed as Henrich et al. apparently are to Mook’s (1983) idea that the
use of WEIRD samples is justiﬁed “when seeking existential proofs”
(sect. 7.1.6, para. 1); nor to the authors’ admittedly clever idea of
setting up research facilities in bus terminals and airports to
capture non-university participants (sect. 7.3, para. 6) – if the
same old suspect methods, such as “reactive” questionnaires and
games with trivial pay-offs, would continue to be used.
Henrich et al. believe that behavioral scientists’ tendency to claim
“universality” for data obtained with WEIRD participants may in
part be due to so many researchers themselves being WEIRD
(sect. 7.1.1, para. 8). This fact may also be partly responsible for
researchers’ relative reluctance to worry adequately about external
validity and about the effects of complex higher-order interactions
among type of participants, methods, and settings. A sustained inter-
est in such interactions may require a contextual (“ﬁeld-dependent”)
worldview and a holistic reasoning style that is (according to Henrich
etal.)lessutilizedbyWEIRDpeople,whofavoranalyticalreasoning.

Abstract: This commentary will extend the territory claimed in the target
article by identifying several other areas in the social sciences where
ﬁndings from the WEIRD population have been over-generalized. An
argument is made that the root problem is the ethnocentrism of
scholars, textbook authors, and social commentators, which leads them
to take their own cultural values as the norm.
I am grateful to the authors of the target article for illuminating
this very serious problem in the social and behavioral sciences. I
also have written critically on the issue, but without the courage
to fully assert the fundamental weirdness of researchers’ favorite
subjects. I will add to Henrich et al.’s catalog by brieﬂy reviewing
several areas where the WEIRD tribe can be shown to be
extreme outliers.
Culture and cognitive development. The best known model of
cognitive development originated with the Swiss biologist, Jean
Piaget. He derived his theory largely on his observations and
interactions with his own very brainy and sophisticated children
(Vidal 1994). As Piaget (and colleagues) tested his propositions,
subjects were largely drawn from the same milieu of middle-
class European society. Piaget led the vanguard but a veritable
army of cognitivists followed in his wake. The models that
emerged were rooted entirely in research with children from
the WEIRD tribe. Had these scholars delved into the anthropo-
logical literature, particularly with respect to the cognitive
processes implicated in native belief systems, they might have
paused to consider the implications. Indeed, Alexander Luria,
close colleague of Lev Vygostsky, traveled to Central Asia in
the 1930s and easily discovered alternative patterns of thinking
in the reasoning of Uzbek peasants (Luria 1976).
Later, researchers working in West Africa (Dasen et al. 1978;
Greenﬁeld 1966) and Papua New Guinea (PNG) (Kelly 1971)
sought to test these theoretical ideas about children’s cognitive
development outside the West and found that they didn’t hold
up very well, especially beyond early childhood. As Luria had
earlier shown, scholars were ﬁnding that cognitive “develop-
ment” was driven by exposure to modern institutions – school-
ing, in particular – rather than reliably erupting, like second
molars (Cole et al. 1971). Others succeeded in showing very
speciﬁc connections between cultural practices and cognitive
skill (Price-Williams et al. 1969). Somewhat later in PNG, the
typical two-culture (WEIRD vs. “other”) comparison was broad-
ened to systematically assess cognition in a variety of societies
with varying subsistence patterns and degrees of acculturation
(Lancy 1983). These studies revealed that the patterns of cogni-
tive behavior in the WEIRD population were uncommon com-
pared to preferred local alternatives (Lancy & Strathern 1981).
Culture and children’s social behavior. Social psychologist
Millard Madsen began with the premise that Western middle-
class children were markedly different. He devised a series of inge-
nious, game-like devices that unambiguously revealed whether a
child was disposed towards a competitive or cooperative stance. In
his initial work, he found that subjects in the United States made
only competitive moves in the game (which only rewarded coopera-
tive moves), whereas children from a Mexican village made only
cooperative moves. Replicated in numerous other societies, the
studies revealed U.S. children as outliers, being much more com-
petitive than children from other societies (Madsen 1971).
Further cross-cultural variation was neatly predicted by the child’s
social circumstances, so village kids were found to be more coopera-
tive than urban kids, for example. In the highlands of PNG, Melpa
children from warring clans were less cooperative than pairs from
the same or allied clans (Lancy & Madsen 1981).
Culture and parent-child interaction. The problem identiﬁed
by Henrich et al. arises, I believe, from a (likely universal) ethno-
centrism. Contemporary orthodoxy regarding child development
and child-rearing can turn nurture into nature. The way WEIRD
parents raise their children becomes more than just the current
fashion, it becomes “natural,” rooted in the phylogeny or
history of the species. This can be quickly illustrated.
Working among the Gusii of Kenya, LeVine (2004) has raised
doubts about widely accepted tenets of the theory of infant
attachment. Like many, if not the majority of mothers throughout
Commentary/Henrich et al.: The weirdest people in the world?
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:2/3

history, Gusii mothers respond to their infant’s need for suste-
nance but otherwise largely ignore them. Such behavior, if dis-
played by a Euro-American mother, would be grounds for a
clinician to predict later pathological development. Of course,
the Gusii children turn out ﬁne. Closely related is the practice
of talking to nonverbal infants using a special speech register
(baby talk or motherese). Often assumed to be both universal
and essential to the development of speech in children, it is in
fact neither (Ochs & Schieffelin 1984). “Parenting style” theory
(Baumrind 1971) cannot withstand cross-cultural scrutiny.
Central African Boﬁfarmers ﬁt the so-called authoritarian par-
enting style in valuing respect and obedience and exercising coer-
cive control over their children. Boﬁchildren should, therefore,
be withdrawn, non-empathetic, and aggressive, and lack initiat-
ive. On the contrary, they display precisely the opposite traits,
leading Fouts (2005) to conclude that the theory “has very little
explanatory power among the Boﬁ” (p. 361).
Parent-child play is another in this basket of parenting beha-
viors that illustrates how nurture is made out to be nature. A
recent textbook describes variation in patterns of parent-child
play, but never questions its universality (see Scarlett et al.
2005). One scholar of infancy claimed that the absence of
mother-infant play signaled attachment failure or worse (Tre-
varthen 1983, p. 151). Empirical studies of mother-child play typi-
cally report that “Mothers were instructed to play with their [2- to
3-years-old] children as they would at home” (Stipek 1995, p. 244;
emphasis added). Another common feature is the use of well-off,
highly educated subjects, with no caveat about the limited gener-
alizability of the results (see Sung & Hsu 2009, p. 432). However,
in a recent review of the ethnographic record, with hundreds of
cases, parent-child play was found to be extremely rare and dis-
tinctly incompatible with many native ideas about “best practices”
(Lancy 2007). To parents, play’s chief value is in keeping children
out of the way (Whittemore 1989, p. 92).
Lastly, I would demur from the notion that parents’ active
teaching of children is both universal and the essential com-
ponent of cultural transmission (Csibra & Gergely 2009;
Strauss & Ziv 2004). A thorough survey of ethnographic and his-
torical cases shows teaching by parents to be extremely limited
(Lancy & Grove 2010); children are expected to learn from
observation, imitation, and practice. As Fiske (1997) notes, in
the ethnographic record there is “much less child-rearing than
there is culture-seeking” (p. 11).

Abstract: Henrich et al. convincingly cautionagainstthe overgeneralization
of ﬁndings from particular human populations, but fail to apply their own
compelling reasoning to our nearest living relatives, the great apes. Here
we argue that rearing history is every bit as important for understanding
cognition in other species as it is in humans.
Henrich et al. provide a timely cross-cultural analysis of percep-
tual and cognitive abilities in humans, concluding that a signiﬁ-
cant number of allegedly human-universal capacities are, in
fact, conﬁned to speciﬁc socio-cultural environments. Ironically,
they caution against overgeneralizing from particular humans to
all humans, everywhere, but fail to correctly generalize their own
arguments to nonhuman species. In section 7.1.4, Heinrich et al.
highlight both the need for and the limits of comparisons
between human and nonhuman primates. Their point is that con-
tradictory conclusions about the taxonomic distribution of cognitive
abilities could be reached, depending upon which human cultures
are sampled. What they fail to elucidate is that precisely the same
arguments also apply to nonhuman primates, particularly the great
apes, humans’ nearest living relatives. The over-reliance in psychol-
ogy on one group of humans, WEIRD, to represent “the human” in
cognitiveterms has a strong parallel in the over-reliancein compara-
tive psychology on chimpanzees raised in Barren, Institutional, Zoo,
And other Rare Rearing Environments (BIZARRE) to represent
“the chimpanzee.” Cross-species comparisons are appropriate only
with careful consideration of speciﬁc rearing environments (e.g.,
Bard 1998; 2008; Bard & Leavens 2009; Boesch 2007; Bulloch
et al. 2008; Leavens 2002; 2004; 2006; Leavens & Racine 2009;
Leavens et al. 2005a, 2008; 2009; Lyn et al. 2010; Racine et al. 2008).
The case of manual pointing provides an example of overgener-
alization in both humans and nonhumans. Western scientists por-
trayed pointing with the index ﬁnger as a human species-speciﬁc
gesture adapted for referential communication (Butterworth
2003; Eibl-Eibesfeldt 1989; Povinelli & Davis 1994; Povinelli
et al. 2003). Degos (2001) recently asserted that “[t]he pointing
gesture is exclusively human, and universal within mankind”
(p. 263). In fact, although widespread, index-ﬁnger pointing is
neither universal nor necessarily the predominant manner of
pointing even where it is found (Enﬁeld 2001; Wilkins 2003).
The formerly popular idea that pointing with a particular ﬁnger
extended reﬂects the shared evolutionary history of all humans,
everywhere, exempliﬁes the kind of reckless disregard for cultural
variability that Henrich et al. rightly criticize. Production and
comprehension of pointing are widely viewed as indices to cogni-
tive processes supporting reference, perspective-taking, and the
construction of shared goals (e.g., Tomasello 2006).
Like humans, chimpanzees display group differences in point-
ing. Figure 1 depicts three pointing phenotypes, all emanating
from the same gene pool (Leavens 2004; Leavens et al. 2005a;
2008). As this ﬁgure makes clear, depending upon which chim-
panzees are sampled, entirely contradictory conclusions can be
reached as to whether pointing is a shared characteristic of
great apes and humans. Consider the incidence of manual point-
ing: If home-reared or language-trained apes were compared
with humans from cultures that prohibit manual pointing, one
could reach the erroneous conclusion that great apes point
manually, whereas humans do not; this would be a consequence
of overgeneralizing from both of the speciﬁc human and chim-
panzee populations sampled. Recently, numerous researchers
have reached the erroneous conclusion that only humans point
declaratively, because they have compared people of largely
European descent (i.e., WEIRD) with wild chimpanzees or insti-
tutionalized (i.e., BIZARRE) chimpanzees. When chimpanzees
are raised the way human children are raised, in richly interactive
contexts, the chimpanzees will go on to point – point with the
index ﬁnger, frequently point declaratively, and comprehend
pointing by others (Itakura & Tanaka 1998; Leavens et al.
2005a; 2008; Lyn et al. 2010).
Different populations of chimpanzees also display different
communicative expressions and calls. For example, Figure 2
depicts Merv pointing with his index ﬁnger to a squeeze bottle
ﬁlled with juice (out of camera view). The protruded lower lip
is glossed as the “juice-me” face, and to our knowledge appears
only in chimpanzees that experience juice delivery from a
bottle with a downward-pointing spout. Chimpanzees adapt
calls to serve functions in captive environments that differ from

their uses in the wild: chimpanzees in captivity selectively emit
attention-getting calls and other auditory signals, tactically, as a
function of whether an observer is looking at them (Hopkins
et al. 2007; Hostetter et al. 2001; Leavens et al. 2004b; 2010).
The validity of Henrich et al.’s argument does not suddenly
collapse when applied to other species. We agree with Henrich
and his colleagues that scientists need to specify to “which
people” their ﬁndings can be generalized (sect. 7.3). And we
argue here, that, given the variability in communicative signaling
characteristics in different populations of great apes, there
is no rational justiﬁcation for overgeneralizing from BIZARRE
chimpanzees to the entire chimpanzee species. Like humans,
chimpanzees evince different cognitive adaptations to different
environments; no single environmental context can elicit the
full range of chimpanzees’ cognitive capacities.

Abstract: In this commentary, I argue that to properly assess the
signiﬁcance of the cross-cultural ﬁndings reviewed by Henrich et al.,
Figure 1 (Leavens et al.).
Pointing incidence, posture, function, and social use differ radically between different populations of
chimpanzees. Manual pointing: Extension of arm and at least one ﬁnger in triadic contexts. Index ﬁnger: Pointing with outstretched arm
and index ﬁnger. Declarative: Pointing to draw somebody’s attention to an object or event; includes responses to queries, such as
pointing to an object when asked where that object is. Between apes: Pointing by one chimpanzee for another chimpanzee.
Comprehension: Understanding pointing by others. [Sources: Pointing in wild chimpanzees: Inoue-Nakamura and Matsuzawa (1997);
also see Pika and Mitani (2006). Pointing in institutionalized chimpanzees: de Waal (1982); Leavens and Hopkins (1998); Leavens et al.
(1996; 2004a; 2005b); Savage-Rumbaugh (1986); among others. Pointing in home-reared or language-trained chimpanzees is nearly
ubiquitous and has been described by Carpenter et al. (1995); Fouts et al. (1982), Kellogg and Kellogg (1933), Krause and Fouts (1997),
Lyn et al. (2010), and Witmer (1909), among others. See Leavens and Racine (2009) and Leavens et al. (2009) for reviews.]

one needs to understand better the causes of the variation in performance
in experimental tasks across cultures.
Henrich et al. review a large body of evidence showing that
in numerous tasks Westerners (often Americans) behave differ-
ently from people in other cultures. The target article raises
numerous important questions, including: Which psychological
characteristics should we expect to vary from culture to culture
(studying these would necessarily be cross-cultural) and which
should we expect to be universal (studying these could be done
on the basis of samples of convenience)? Why are most examples
in Henrich et al.’s article drawn from social psychology? Is social
cognition particularly likely to vary from culture to culture?
Would we ﬁnd the same cross-cultural variation if we focused
on the phenomena discussed in perceptual and cognitive psy-
chology textbooks (provided the cross-cultural data are avail-
able)? Do the ﬁndings reviewed by Henrich et al. suggest
replacing the traditional search for human psychological univer-
sals (our human nature) with the search for laws that connect
psychological variation to social and ecological conditions?
Although these questions are fascinating, for the sake of
space I will focus only on the following issue: It is unfortunate
that Henrich and colleagues chose to say little about the causes
of the cross-cultural variation they present evidence about,
since the signiﬁcance of this variation depends on the exact
nature of these causes. To illustrate this point, I examine three
possible explanations of the cross-cultural variation described
by Henrich et al., and I consider how these explanations
bear on the signiﬁcance of the ﬁndings presented in the target
article.
It is well known that when participants conceptualize a given
experimental task differently (perhaps because they have differ-
ent beliefs about the experimenter’s goals), they behave differ-
ently. (In fact, this is a well-known experimental problem.) To
give a single example, Westerners behave differently in economic
games depending on how these are framed (e.g., Hoffman et al.
1994). Some of the ﬁndings discussed by Henrich et al. (perhaps
many) may simply be due to the fact that experimental partici-
pants in different cultures conceptualize the experimental tasks
differently. In fact, Henrich’s own ﬁndings (in previous work
with other colleagues: Henrich et al. 2004; 2005) about the
cross-cultural variation in the Ultimatum, Dictator, and Public
Goods games can be at least partly explained in this way, as
some researchers on Henrich’s team reported that participants
assimilated the economic games to real-life situations (e.g., the
Orma identiﬁed the Public Goods Game with the harambee, a
local ﬁnancial contribution to collective projects; see also
Cronk 2007).
Naturally, when participants in an experimental task (within
a given culture or across cultures) behave differently because
they conceptualize this task differently, this variation does
not show that the individuals who behave differently differ psy-
chologically (i.e., that they have different psychological mechan-
isms, capacities, characteristics, etc.): If one controlled for the
differences in task conceptualization across cultures, the cross-
cultural variation would disappear. Thus, much of Henrich
et al.’s thunder would be stolen if the ﬁndings they describe
were due to people in different cultures conceptualizing the
tasks differently. True, it would still be incorrect to expect
people in different cultures to behave similarly in a given exper-
imental task, but this would not entail that the American mind
differs from, for example, the Peruvian mind or the Machiguenga
mind.
Consider now a second type of explanation. Human beings
have evolved numerous domain-speciﬁc mechanisms that are
designed to interact with the cultural, social, and ecological
environment to produce typically (but not necessarily) locally
adaptive psychological phenotypes. Although there is little
space here to discuss the various ways of specifying this hypoth-
esis (for detail, see Fessler & Machery, forthcoming), let us
consider some possibilities. Some evolved mechanisms might
have parameters which are set to different values in different
environments during development. If the hypothesis of a uni-
versal grammar developed by Chomsky is correct, this is how
natural languages work. Some evolved mechanisms might
provide a template that is completed with culturally local infor-
mation (see, e.g., Barrett’s [2005] hypothesis of a universal,
evolved
mechanism
for
learning
concepts
of
dangerous
animals). It might also be that humans typically possess
various strategies for fulﬁlling a given psychological function
(e.g., categorizing or making decisions under uncertainty) and
that they learn to rely preferentially on the strategies that are
most efﬁcient in their environment, while being able to revert
to the other strategies if needed or primed. Many cross-cultural
ﬁndings might result from people learning to rely preferentially
on a particular strategy among the toolbox of strategies that are
available to them, since, as discussed by Henrich et al., it is
sometimes easy to prime people to adopt the cognitive styles
of cultures they do not belong to. If the cross-cultural variation
in experimental tasks described in the target article were due to
the interaction of universal processes and local environments,
this variation would reﬂect a genuine psychological variation –
a signiﬁcant conclusion: It would show that across cultures,
people do harbor different psychological processes (character-
istics, styles, etc.), or, at least, that they preferentially rely on
different processes (styles, etc.). However, this type of expla-
nation
would
undermine
the
idea,
suggested
throughout
Henrich et al.’ article, that the Western mind is really peculiar,
since the psychological differences across cultures would
emerge from the same basic psychological endowment. In a
sense, the cross-cultural variation in psychological phenotype
would be shallow (particularly if it is merely a matter of
people relying preferentially on different strategies in different
cultures). Furthermore, albeit being an incomplete research
strategy, in need of complementary cross-cultural work, study-
ing Western participants could cast some light on this basic
endowment, exactly as one can learn about the universal
grammar by studying English syntax.
Consider, ﬁnally, a third explanation. Participants in different
cultures behave differently in experimental tasks because people
acquire different psychological processes, traits, or capacities
across cultures as a result of cultural transmission, domain-
general learning mechanisms, and the like. To give a single
example, this third explanation plausibly applies to the cross-cul-
tural variation in semantic intuitions (for review, see Machery,
forthcoming). Philosophers of language have ignored the possi-
bility that the semantic intuitions on which theories of reference
are based might vary across cultures. However, evidence shows
that while Americans tend to view the reference of proper
names as determined by the causal and historical connections
between these names and particular individuals, Chinese are
more likely to view the reference of proper names as deter-
mined by the information speakers associate with these names
(Deutsch et al. 2010; Machery et al. 2004). Follow-up studies
even suggest that Americans are much more likely to hold the
former kind of intuitions than are other Westerners such as
French participants (Machery & Stich, forthcoming; Machery
et al. 2009). If this third explanation explained not only the
variation in semantic, epistemological, and other intuitions
described by experimental philosophers (see Stich’s commen-
tary), but also the ﬁndings summarized by Henrich et al.,
these ﬁndings would then reveal not only that the human
psychological phenotype varies across cultures, but also that
this variation does not merely result from the interaction of a
basic psychological endowment and local environments. Fur-
thermore, studying American participants, as most American
psychologists have done for about a century, would often
reveal nothing about universal properties of the mind; rather,
American psychology would often just be the psychology of
Americans.

The

underestimated the degree of linguistic diversity in the world. Part of
the reason for this is that we have projected assumptions based on
English and familiar languages onto the rest. We focus on some
distortions this has introduced, especially in the study of semantics.
This commentary rounds out the picture convincingly advanced
in the target paper by considering how scientiﬁc approaches
to language have also ignored the diversity of behavior in the
linguistic domain. In the BBS paper “The Myth of Language
Universals,” Evans and Levinson (2009) argue that there is
little evidence for the view that the variation in language struc-
ture is tightly bounded by linguistic universals. Instead, what
we ﬁnd is extensive variation on almost every dimension, with
the main patterns understandable in terms of cultural evolution.
Why does it matter to psychology that languages vary fundamen-
tally on so many dimensions? Leaving aside that it is the highest
learned human skill, and therefore has an interest in its own right,
there are at least two further reasons: (a) Language is in many
ways a “window on the mind,” and (b) semantic variation seems to
correlate with psychological variation on a range of parameters. As
a result, most of our ideas about how humans reason or what
notionsform natural categories areprompted by ourown languages.
We must leave to the historians of science an explanation for how
the myth of language universals came to dominate the language
sciences for 50 years. But one factor is almost certainly the view
that familiar languages such as English are canonical. Yet many
features of English are quite unusual – for example, only 1.6% of
languages express Yes/No questions by word order inversion
(Dryer 2008), and no other known language has verb inﬂection
with non-zero exponent for third person (as in John come-s) but
zero for all other persons (see rara#34 http://typo.uni-konstanz.de/
rara/). As we discuss here, there are languages without such
“natural” concepts as left, in, arm, or green. English is, in fact, in a
special, rather unusual corner of the design space for human
languages, an outlier, not some kind of central default model at all.
Assurveyedinthetargetarticle(sect.3.4),there appearsto besig-
niﬁcant variation in the spatial frames of reference employed cross-
culturally, largely predictable from language – that is, languages
without spatial left and right terms are used by peoples who
prefer allocentric coding. Some authors ﬁnd these results hard to
credit and have wondered whether they don’t reﬂect conscious
ratiocination correcting an innate egocentric bias (Li & Gleitman
2002). Haun and Rapold (2009) now produce additional evidence
for the depth of allocentric coding in a non-WEIRD culture,
Haikom hunter-gatherers of Namibia. Haun and Rapold asked 8-
year-olds to learn a demonstrated dance, and then got them to
repeat the dance under 180-degrees rotation. The Haikom kids
maintained the dance moves in absolute (North-South-East-
West) coordinates under rotation, whereas a matched German
sample maintained the dance moves in egocentric coordinates (in
terms of left/right motions). Given the rigidly egocentric nature
of neural coding for body position, these ﬁndings are quite unex-
pected and show the extent to which a different spatial framework
can be adopted in the cognitive representation of spatial movement.
The spatial encoding of topological relations between objects in
non-WEIRD languages also challenges long-held assumptions
about the human mind. Developmental psychologists and linguists
have supposed that preverbal infants have a stock of prelinguistic
concepts
(either
inborn
or
learned
through
sensorimotor
experience) and that language maps onto these universal primitives
(e.g., Clark 1973; Slobin 1973). These include notions such as in, on,
and under – exactly those concepts found in English. Infants less
than a year old show sophisticated understandings of such relations
(Baillargeon 1994). But subsequent crosslinguistic investigation has
shown considerable variation in how languages express spatial con-
cepts (Bowerman 1996; Bowerman & Choi 2001). Korean speakers
distinguish between “tight-ﬁtting” and “loose-ﬁtting relations”
instead of “containment” (as in in) or “support” (as in on). This
ﬁnding has had a profound impact on how we currently think
about the infant mind. Rather than the infant coming to the world
with only English spatial categories, she comes now with Korean
ones, too (Hespos & Spelke 2002; McDonough et al. 2003), and
researchers are actively pursuing which of the myriad further dis-
tinctions coded in other languages maybe present for the infant, too.
In another domain, vision scientists have been impressed by the
correspondence between the algorithms used by the visual system
to parse the world around us and their reﬂection in language.
Hoffman and Richards (1984, p. 82), after discussing how parts are
assigned when viewing a face, conclude that: “It is probably no acci-
dent thatthe partsdeﬁned by minima are often easily assigned verbal
labels” – the caveat being “in English.” The parts assigned verbal
labels in other languages differ substantially. In Jahai, a language
spoken in the Malay Peninsula by a group of nomadic hunter-gath-
erers, speakers make ﬁne-grained segmentations of the body and
face: there is no term corresponding to face, arm, or leg (Burenhult
2006).ComparethiswithLavukaleve,spokenbysomethousand-odd
subsistence ﬁshers and farmers on the Solomon Islands. Lavukaleve
speakers have a much coarser-grained system and use a single term
to refer to arms and legs, with no ﬁner-level conventionalized terms
for the limbs (Terrill 2006). The correspondence between English
part categories and those identiﬁed by the vision sciences has
caused researchers to seriously misjudge the issues involved in
a theory of the language–perception interface (Majid 2010).
Take color as yet another domain. Here language plays a critical
role. Languages carve up the spectrum into a number of discrete
categories, and it is these linguistic categories that are utilized in
memory and perception (Davidoff et al. 1999; Gilbert et al. 2006).
Speakers of languages from WEIRD societies make ﬁner divisions
in the colorspace than dospeakersof mostofthethousandsofother
languagesoftheworld(Kay& Mafﬁ2008),andthe pinnacle ofcolor
categorization (in terms of how many divisions of the color space
a language makes) has been taken to be 11 – exactly the number
that English has (Berlin & Kay 1969; Kay & Mafﬁ2008). But
there is accumulating evidence that WEIRD societies may be sur-
passedin this domain. InRussian (Corbett & Davies 1995), Turkish
(O¨ zgen & Davies 1998), Greek (Thierry et al. 2009), and Japanese
(Uchikawa & Boynton 1987), there are 12 terms (an additional dis-
tinction is made between dark and light blue). The new pinnacle is
15, as demonstrated by Korean (see Roberson et al. 2008).
Human performance diversity offers a rich resource for cogni-
tive scientists. It allows us to triangulate on underlying properties
of mind that would be invisible if we were all culturally identical.
Instead of lamenting the loss of the “psychic unity of mankind,”
we should embrace the study of cognitive diversity as a window
on human cognitive potential.

humans because they are at the extreme end of the distribution for
societal formations. In their vision, it is best to stick with the “tried and
true” traditional societies for speculations about human nature. This
commentary offers a more realistic starting point, and, oddly enough,
concludes that WEIRD populations may be more compatible with
humans’ evolved nature than are most traditional societies.
While Henrich et al. exaggerate the extent to which under-
graduates are used to generalize about pan-human traits (as
many social scientists still refuse to subscribe to the premise
that a human nature exists), it is true that such generalizations
are often implicit in research ﬁndings. I also endorse the
authors’ call for more cross-species research and new research
designs. But I strongly disagree with the claim that WEIRD
populations skew the traits that characterize Homo sapiens.
Henrich et al. also overstate the value of the cross-cultural
method for uncovering the evolutionary foundations of human
cognition and social behavior. Let me highlight some of these
limitations.
What is to be learned from cross-cultural research? The cross-
cultural method has a long history It originated in the 19th
century when ethnographers took to the ﬁeld to “discover” the
fundamental and universal core of humans and society. These
ethnographies, along with the Human Relations Area Files
(HRAF), are readily available in most libraries. What researchers
found is that cultures are organized around systems of common
meanings that members use to direct behaviors and organize
social relations. A key ﬁnding is that despite a remarkable diver-
sity, broad-based cultural universals do exist, and therefore, the
cross-cultural method has proven to be useful in making general-
izations about human cognitions, personality, culture, and
society. But it has failed to uncover an anchor of underlying
pan-human traits.
Today, these populations speak only in the “ethnographic
present.” Hunter-gatherer societies, who monopolized 95% of
human history, are extinct. Most horticultural societies are also
extinct or hardly recognizable from their past history, as they
have had to adapt to a 21st-century industrialized world. The
cross-cultural method is still valuable, of course, but no matter
what samples of societies are used, claims about pan-human psy-
chology and social behavior are not easily made from the data.
We still confront the problems of earlier researchers: How do
we distinguish the simplest, oldest, and most exotic traits from
the most common traits? For, once humans abandoned the
hunter-gatherer lifestyle, institutional arrangements and second-
ary adaptations were set into motion and passed down from gen-
eration to generation, including symbolic traditions unique to
a population. Hence, even if we believe that a substratum of
evolved human proclivities exists, they are always at the mercy
of culture and social forces that can repress them, channel
them towards more normative behaviors, or, in some societies,
allow them to be expressed. How, then, do we identify an evol-
utionary-derived trait from a socio-cultural trait? Hence, on
what empirical grounds can the authors claim that WEIRD
people are not in tune with their evolved nature? What yardstick
justiﬁes such a claim? In the future, would it really be a surprise
that as populations around the globe slowly industrialize and set
up democratic institutions, they too may come to resemble
WEIRD populations? Who, then, should we nominate as unre-
presentative of our species? The authors’ call for new research
designs for uncovering evolved traits, however, is much more
promising.
A call for new research programs. Do human proclivities exist
that characterize our species? Rather than falling into assump-
tions about human nature, we do need new research designs
that include an evolutionary perspective, cross-species research,
and a true interdisciplinary approach. In particular, I think we
need to start by searching our evolutionary past for clues. Let
me illustrate with two basic questions on human biology and
human sociality: (1) How much genetic variability exists in the
human genome; and (2) are humans naturally social?
Low genetic diversity. Recent ﬁndings reveal that the human
genome has less genetic diversity than the chimpanzee (Pan),
our closest living relative (Bakewell et al. 2007; Gagneux &
Varki 2001; Kaessmann & Paabo, 2002: Kaessmann et al.
1999). This surprisingly low level of genetic variability suggests
that humans today are all descendants of a small “mother”
deme that may have numbered only in the hundreds (Long &
Kittles 2003; Relethford 2002). If so, despite great human
cultural variation, a high probability exists for a bedrock of
evolved traits. In addition, the fossil record tells us that anatomi-
cally modern humans evolved about 150 thousand years ago
(Garrigan & Hammer 2006; Smith et al. 2007). This means that
hunter-gatherer populations were around for at least 140,000
years before horticultural farmers. As data on studied hunter-
gatherers clearly demonstrate, they share a remarkable number
of institutional arrangements with traits that include high indivi-
dualism, reciprocity, and low levels of inequality; and their well-
preserved ethnographies are surely a more fruitful resource for
clues into our evolved nature.
How naturally social are humans? Humans are evolved apes
This fact has important implications for how we might go about
studying our biologically based propensities and social arrange-
ments. One way to gain insights into the distant past is to use cla-
distic analysis, social network analysis, and evolutionary theory.
One intriguing ﬁnding is that monkeys (which make up 70% of
all primates) are high-density collectivists, whereas great apes
are low-density and low-sociality individualists, with needs for
autonomy and mobility. Witness the orangutan, which is nearly
solitary. Thus, one starting point for clues into our evolved
nature is to study our primate relatives along with past hunter-
gatherer societies. These data suggest that the high-sociality, col-
lectivist touchstone we have used to characterize Homo sapiens
may be misguided. And oddly enough, since the days of
hunter-gathering, the society that best ﬁts this view of human
nature – at least in terms of placing a high value on individual-
ism, mobility in space, relative autonomy, veriﬁcation of self,
sexual equality, and freedom of choice – are WEIRD popu-
lations. For, despite all the multiple ills of industrialized societies,
WEIRD societies may be more compatible with our human
nature than the high-density kinship constraints of horticultural
societies or the “peasant” constraints of agrarian societies with
their privileged few (for data on this argument, see Maryanski
& Turner 1992; Turner & Maryanski 2005; 2008).

Abstract: A literature in which most data are outliers is ﬂawed, and the
target article sounds a timely alarm call for the behavioural sciences.
It also suggests remedies. We mostly concur, except for arguing that
the importance of the fact that the researchers themselves are mostly
outliers has been underplayed. Improving matters requires non-
Western researchers, as well as research subjects.
Henrich et al. provide an important piece of “consciousness
raising”: They remind us that human beings are complicated
and diverse, and review evidence that the variance in some
types of behaviour and cognitive performance is far greater
than has often been assumed. These facts have been obscured
by the WEIRD-ness of the vast majority of the research subjects

in behavioural science: people are not interchangeable in the
same sense in which a sample of gold, whatever its origin, can
be taken to the laboratory and treated as representative of gold
generally. No one geographical, cultural, or socio-economic sub-
group of people (least of all, perhaps, contemporary Western
undergraduates) is representative of humanity. This means the-
ories tested only or largely against a narrow range of subjects
are likely to be incomplete or outright false. Behavioural scien-
tists, in other words, have engaged in precipitate theorizing:
outliers are unlikely to constrain explanatory theories correctly
or inspire the right sort of hypothesizing.
To remedy this bias, ideally, we need globally representative
samples of subjects in order to generate thorough descriptions
of cognitive phenomena, guide hypothesis formation, and rigor-
ously to test theories. The logistical and ﬁnancial challenges of
conducting research on this basis are immense. Overcoming
them requires, among other things, changes in the research
culture and to academic incentives (here Henrich et al.’s rec-
ommendations are spot on). In psychology, for example, the
current incentives produce many small, single-institution, low-
powered studies aimed at discovering novel effects. What we
need, however, is not, say, evidence of yet more ways of modulat-
ing implicit associations in American undergraduates. Rather, we
need large, prospectively designed, highly powered, cross-cul-
tural studies that can answer speciﬁc questions more deﬁnitively.
Medical research provides a model behavioural researchers
would do well to emulate. In general and in outline, before
some clinical intervention is approved for use, research must
proceed through three stages. This begins with small open-
label studies in Phase I; proceeds to larger, single-blind trials
in Phase II; and culminates in large, multi-center, randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in Phase III. Behavioural
scientists conduct too many studies in the equivalent of Phases I
or II, with too few large, deﬁnitive and cross-cultural studies.
There is still room for small studies – important novel phenom-
ena undoubtedly await discovery. We merely suggest more
“Phase III” research. Pooling resources, exploiting various
online collaboration tools (e.g., Nielsen 2008), and shifting edi-
torial policies and research priorities should result in more
large, cross-cultural studies being conducted.
That noted, Henrich et al. underplay – to the point of
missing – that how the behavioural sciences research community
itself is constituted introduces biases. That the subject-pool of be-
havioural science is so shallow is indeed a serious problem, but so
is the fact that the majority of behavioural researchers are them-
selves deeply WEIRD. People in Western countries have, on
average, a remarkably homogenous set of values compared to
the full range of worldwide variability (Inglehart & Welzel
2005), and the data Henrich et al. adduce suggest similarly popu-
lation-level homogeneity in cognitive styles. Moreover, aca-
demics are more uniform than the populations from which
they are drawn (as the target article’s Contrast 4 suggests), so it
is not implausible to think behavioural scientists are even
WEIRD-er than their most common subjects. Henrich et al.
review a body of studies and experiments that did not strike
those who designed and conducted them as focused on outliers.
Intelligent scientists acting in good faith conducted, peer-
reviewed, and published this research, honestly believing in
many cases that it threw light on human nature. This forcefully
illustrates the power of the biases on the part of researchers
themselves. It also suggests that, besides widening the pool of
subjects, there are signiﬁcant gains to be made by broadening
the range of inputs to the scientiﬁc process, including in the con-
ception, design, and evaluation of empirical and theoretical work.
Given that diverse groups are demonstrably better at some kinds
of problem solving (e.g., Hong & Page 2004; Lakhani et al. 2006),
as things stand, the WEIRD-dominated literature is robbed of
potentially worthwhile perspectives, critiques, and hypotheses
that a truly global research community could provide. Clearly,
simply
increasing
the
number
of
behavioural
sciences
researchers will, in general, be beneﬁcial. Our key contention,
though, is that the marginal beneﬁts of additional Western
researchers are much smaller than the marginal beneﬁts of
more
non-Western
researchers,
among
other
things,
just
because they are non-Western.
The non-Western world, in short, can contribute not only
additional subjects to experiment upon – the main focus of the
target article’s recommendations – but also additional research-
ers, with novel perspectives and ideas and who are less affected
by WEIRD biases. (Naturally, these researchers will have
biases of their own. Our claim is not that there is someone who
consistently knows better than WEIRD researchers. It is that
diverse groups of investigators can avoid some kinds of error.)
Clearly, these researchers will have to be educated, will likely
be middle class, and, since science ﬂourishes in politically open
societies, they will tend be concentrated in liberal countries.
Nevertheless, additional non-Western researchers, even if they
are educated and relatively wealthy, could be a boon to the
behavioural sciences.
A direct and powerful way to remedy both sources of bias –
too many WEIRD subjects and too few non-WEIRD research-
ers – is to foster research capacity in the non-Western world.
Non-WEIRD researchers tend to study non-WEIRD subjects,
so increasing their number will deepen the subject pool and
widen the range of inputs to the scientiﬁc process at the same
time. Building research capacity, however, should not merely
involve collaborations led by WEIRD researchers; it should
aim to generate studies led and initiated by non-Western
researchers. Committed and long-term inter-institutional collab-
oration between Western and non-Western universities focused
on remedying the deﬁcits in the behavioural sciences literature
should include internships at Western universities for non-
Western researchers, stints at non-Western universities for
WEIRD researchers, and extensive student exchange pro-
grammes (especially for graduate students). Unlike many existing
scholarship and exchange programmes in the sciences, a key
point of the necessary programmes should be for the learning
to proceed in both directions.

Abstract: We agree with Henrich et al. that documenting cultural
universality and variability provides an indispensable window into
human nature. We want to stress the mediating role development plays
between
evolution
and
culture.
Moving
beyond
the
mere
documentation of universality or variability, developmental approaches
can provide mechanistic explanations, linking ecology to phenotype.
Combining phylogeny and adaptationism, evolutionary approaches can
explain the properties of developmental systems.
The target article epitomizes a growing appetite for interdisci-
plinary research, bridging balkanized ﬁelds such as psychology,
economics, anthropology, and biology. This integration requires
“a research program that can explain the manifest patterns of
similarity and variation by clarifying the underlying evolutionary
and development processes” (sect. 7.2, para. 2). Development

must be a foundation stone upon which this new program is
built – if not, to stretch our titular metaphor, the conceived
integration will be stillborn.
Confronted with a catalogue of human universals (e.g., social
exchange) and cultural variation (e.g., rituals), social scientists
traditionally link universals with evolutionary processes and
variation with developmental ones. Echoing Henrich et al., we
believe this is a false choice. Among other reasons, developmen-
tal mechanisms, including the learning abilities giving rise to cul-
tural transmission, are products of natural selection; universality
can arise for several reasons, natural selection being one of them
(Jablonka & Lamb 2005); and, evolutionary processes can result
in adaptive plasticity, developmental systems capable of con-
structing a range of adaptive phenotypes, contingent on the
local ecology.
To illustrate how natural selection can tailor development to
local conditions, let us consider the soapberry bug, a half-inch-
long, seed-eating insect dwelling in the Southeastern United
States (Carroll 1993; Carroll & Corneli 1995). While it takes a
male soapberry bug only ten minutes to copulate with a female,
he may spend hours more anchored to her by means of specially
designed genital hooks. This mate guarding increases ﬁtness
by preventing rival males from copulating with a female before
she lays her eggs. However, guarding comes at a price – males
could be copulating with additional females. The local sex ratio
arbitrates this opportunity cost: fewer females leads to more mate
guarding.
In Oklahoma, where sex ratios vary between populations,
males exhibit adaptive plasticity, calibrating the amount of
mate guarding to the sex ratio experienced during development.
By contrast, in Florida, where sex ratios don’t vary, male soap-
berry bugs engage in a ﬁxed amount of mate guarding, and,
when raised in lab conditions with variable sex ratios, are incap-
able of calibrating. Soapberry bugs teach us why natural selection
and development should not be seen as opposites. Natural selec-
tion designs developmental mechanisms, and these mechanisms
give birth to phenotypes adapted to their local ecologies. When
environments routinely vary, natural selection can engineer
developmental mechanisms that use experience to facultatively
adjust behavior.
Some of the variation across human cultures may be due to
calibration, analogous to mate guarding in soapberry bugs. For
example, women growing up in harsh environments – where
life-expectancies are lower – exhibit earlier onset of menarche
and younger age of ﬁrst birth than women growing up in safe
environments (Ellis et al. 1999). The explanation for this acceler-
ated reproductive strategy, seen in other animals as well, may be
a quantity/quality trade-off: When long life is a given, organisms
invest in prolonged growth and development, resulting in fewer
but higher quality offspring; when life is short, organisms forgo
further growth and development, focusing instead on maximizing
the number of offspring (Belsky et al. 1991). The developmental
system, in this case determining the timing of reproduction, can
thereby produce a correlation between ecology and behavior.
Variation in cultural practices, such as coming of age rituals,
may then partially reﬂect the interaction between evolved devel-
opmental processes and the state of the environment.
Of course, humans are more complex than soapberry bugs. In
addition to calibration, human developmental systems can be
“open,” enabling the acquisition of novel skills and information.
When combined with culture, a repository of wisdom accumu-
lated across generations, novel skills and information can be
passed directly to other individuals, bypassing genetic trans-
mission (Richerson & Boyd 2005). Infants and children are
thus tasked with extracting adaptive cultural information in
order to become competent adults; while adults are tasked with
teaching them. The lesson, here, is not that social learning
precludes evolutionary explanation; instead, the psychological
mechanisms subserving cultural transmission should be viewed
as adaptations (e.g., Csibra & Gergely 2009).
However, culture is more than a consequence of social learn-
ing adaptations; culture can impose selection pressures on devel-
opmental processes, altering their genetic compositions (i.e.,
gene-culture coevolution; Richerson & Boyd 2005). As Henrich
et al. discuss, the ability of some people to consume milk into
adulthood, particularly those from European and some African
populations, provides a clear-cut example: A cultural adaptation,
pastoralism, and its consequence, the prevalence of milk, created
a novel selection pressure on genes, prolonging the production of
lactase, an enzyme needed to digest milk sugars. Research on
how coevolutionary processes shaped human cognition and
development is still in its infancy.
Although Henrich et al. survey the rich breadth of the human
experience, it is worth underscoring just how special we are: No
other animal occupies as many different ecologies, no other
animal deploys a comparable range of subsistence techniques,
and no other animal exhibits as wide a range of social structures.
The propensity for this plasticity makes sense only in the light of
evolution. Fear not: An evolutionary explanation need not be
simplistic; a thorough explanation of human plasticity requires,
at a minimum, phylogenetic, paleo-ecological, cross-cultural,
and adaptationist considerations. For example, recent research
on past climates points not to a static evolutionary ecology, but
to one in which climate change was the norm (reviewed in
Richerson et al. 2001). Further, the timescale of this climatic
variation was short, particularly during the late Pleistocene
(120,000 to 10,000 years ago) when environments changed radi-
cally on the order of hundreds to thousands of years, a situation
best tracked by cultural adaptation, rather than genetic evolution
(too slow) or individual learning (too error prone). Our human
nature, housing a rich array of evolved developmental mechan-
isms capable of open-ended, facultative adaptation, may have
been conceived in this nurturing cradle of change.
Learning precisely how the human mind emerged from the
evolutionary process poses a challenge that some believe insur-
mountable (e.g., Lewontin 1998). We remain optimistic. Progress
will be made as research becomes increasingly interdisciplinary.
Scholars interested in developmental processes will beneﬁt from
attending to cross-cultural studies, as processes often reveal
themselves through their manifestations in different ecological
contexts. An understanding of developmental processes will
beneﬁt students of culture, as development links ecology to be-
havior. An evolutionary perspective can illuminate why humans
have the particular developmental mechanisms they do, given
our species’ evolutionary history.

Abstract: Most psychological research consists of experiments that put
people in artiﬁcial situations that elicit unnatural behavior whose
ecological validity is unknown. Without knowing the psychocultural
meaning of experimental situations, we cannot interpret the responses
of WEIRD people, let alone people in other cultures. Psychology, like
other sciences, needs to be solidly rooted in naturalistic observation
and description of people around the world. Theory should be
inductively developed and tested against real-world behavior.
We applaud Henrich et al. for their cogent demonstration of the
need for more representative samples in psychological research

in order to permit generalization to the human species. However,
even if participant samples are representative, the psychology eli-
cited by experiments that require participants to make judgments
in response to hypothetical situations, answer abstract questions,
or behave in response to artiﬁcial laboratory tasks may not be
representative of – or even very informative about – human psy-
chology across most domains of life. To understand human
nature, our methods must explore the psychology of natural
human experience. By this, we mean that psychological theory
must be grounded in detailed observation and description of
everyday life across cultures in order to understand the cognitive
mechanisms that operate in the naturally occurring situations to
which humans are adapted.

example, Henrich et al. show how theories about judgments of
fairness and cooperation have to take into account the culture
of the people making those judgments. But there is a further
problem with basing our psychological theory on studies of econ-
omic games: Behavior in artiﬁcial games does not correlate
strongly to social behavior in the community (Gurven &
Winking 2008). If the cooperative behavior and fairness judg-
ments we want to understand are those that occur in everyday
behavior in communities, rather than only those that are speciﬁc
to the particular artiﬁcial framework of the Ultimatum Game,
then we need real-world validity. That is, we need experiments
that make sense to participants because the psychology of the
experiment matches the psychology of behavior in the real
world. ODD psychological research programs rarely provide evi-
dence regarding the ecological validity of the results based on
experiments that typically use extremely impoverished stimuli,
severely restrict responses, or are based on hypothetical scen-
arios and Likert-scale responses to questions about abstract
concepts.
Moreover, we can only interpret data if we know how partici-
pants have interpreted the research situation, the task, and the
stimuli. For example, WEIRD people are used to identifying
themselves and stating their interests and values, and typically
welcome the opportunity to do so. But even WEIRD Scandina-
vians ﬁnd this an uncomfortably unnatural practice; on the ﬁrst
day of seminar, a Scandinavian student whose turn comes to
“say a bit about yourself” is embarrassed and confused by this
American practice, which feels uncomfortably self-promoting
(Lotte Thomsen, personal communication). In Burkina Faso,
Moose informants ﬁnd any personal questions threatening and
demeaning: “To ask about my thoughts, desires, or activities is
to seek control over me, possibly in order to thwart or harm
me.” Given this interpretation of an interview or questionnaire,
Moose responses mean something quite different from the
responses of Americans, who tend to perceive personal questions
as a welcome invitation to assert themselves and make them-
selves look good.
If we do not know the psychocultural meaning of an experi-
ence, we cannot understand the meaning of responses to the
experience. Attachment research is based on infants’ behavior
when their caretakers leave them in a “strange situation.” In
most African cultures, infants are on the body of their mother
or other close kin much of the time, sleep with them, and are
never out of sight of their immediate family members. Families
expect children to form inalienable bonds of interdependence
with them. In contrast, German infants sleep alone, are often
left in daycare for many hours with strangers, and in early child-
hood are expected to play alone and are often left at home
unattended (LeVine & Norman 2001). German parents foster
self-reliance and autonomy. Consequently, being separated
from the mother in the strange situation has completely different
meanings for African and German infants, so their responses
cannot be directly compared.
Psychological theory over the past 40 years has been formu-
lated mostly on the basis of prior theory, data, and intuitions.
As researchers are largely from WEIRD populations, the theor-
etical constructs that inform experimental design tend to be
based on WEIRD intuitions and stimulated by ODD data and
theory. If our goal is to understand human thinking and behavior
in the world, we must leave our desks and begin collecting an
extensive and rich body of naturalistic descriptive data based
on various kinds of observation. Currently, experimental papers
are accorded the highest prestige in psychology and comprise
the vast majority of studies published in top journals (Cialdini
2009). Experimental controls are invaluable, but they are
useless if the constructs being tested are invalid or the exper-
iment elicits unnatural psychology. A natural science of psychol-
ogy should be based on naturalistic study in the real world of
diverse situations in diverse cultures. Just as botany, zoology,
ecology, geology, astronomy, chemistry, and physics grew out
of, constantly return to, and must ultimately be validated by
observations of the natural world, so psychology should be. In
addition to relying on analytic and functional approaches,
psychological constructs should be cultivated inductively from
observation and we should grow our theories by contemplating
naturally occurring patterns of action. Experiments are one way
to test such constructs and theories, but they are not the only
way. Often they are insufﬁcient if we want to make inferences
about behavior outside the lab, beyond key presses and pencil
marks.

Abstract: Catchy acronyms such as “WEIRD population” are good
mnemonics. However, they carry the danger of distracting us from
deeper issues: how to sample populations, the validity of measuring
instruments, the levels of processing involved. These need to be
considered when assessing claims of universality regarding how the
mind works “in general” – a dominant and highly rewarded drive in the
behavioral and brain sciences.
As behavioral scientists, we have to come to terms with the fact
that, if we want to survive in our culture, publishing and building
a reputation that brings recognition, not to mention salary and
grant money, it is better to account for what is stable and predict-
able. It often has better academic pay-off than trying to account
for what is diverse and variable.
In academia, a priori claims of universality sell better than
diversity, which complicates rather than simpliﬁes matters. Uni-
versality claims get more attention because they are cleaner and
sharper, projecting more encompassing control and predictive
power in the ﬁeld. Such claims are also better didactic tools.
They have all-around greater impact and appeal. This tends to
relegate diversity to noise rather than a primary object of study.
There is no clear escape from such reality. Yet, as scientists, we
have to be constantly reminded of how bully-ish and presumptu-
ous we intrinsically are in our reductions and generalizations.
This is what Henrich et al. do pointedly in their target article.
They deserve to be congratulated for their effort, in the footsteps
of Arnett (2008) and Rozin (2009). However, there are some
important points that they either omit, or at least seem to gloss
over too quickly.

First of all, the serious issue of universal validity cannot be
resolved by just testing a larger, more culturally diverse popu-
lation. The sampling of diversity is crucial. The idea of setting
up labs at international airport terminals, as recommended in
the article, will simply not do it. Think about it: Who is traveling
to foreign countries by plane? Those internationally “rich” ones
would arguably be no more diverse (hence representative) than
college students. They might be as “weird” and non-representa-
tive, not a good measure of what is universal or variable about the
mind. As a measure of the sampling issue problem, be reminded
that 80% of the world’s population lives on a family income of less
than $6,000 a year, with half of the world’s population living on an
average of 2 dollars a day (Kent & Haub 2005; UNDP 2006).
Who would claim that poverty has no impact on shaping the
mind? However, dividing the world into rich and poor would
include major confounds, and the question is where to set the
limits of the population category boundaries?
The question, somehow eluded in Heinrich et al., is: how to
sample diversity and what rationale to adopt? What are the cri-
teria? Geographic? Ecological? Physiological? Socioeconomic?
Demographic? Cultural? These are important considerations
and, in the end, it all depends on the theory behind the quest
for universality. Diversity cannot be controlled just for the sake
of it, particularly if the ultimate motive is to determine what is
invariant and what changes across populations. The delicate
question, somehow glossed over by the authors, is: On what
basis do we cluster populations? Such decision can often be
“shaky.” For example, catchy acronyms like “WEIRD” for a
population sample are good mnemonics. However, they carry
the danger of distracting us from deeper issues. The last letter,
D, for example, stands for “Democratic.” What does this mean,
given that many Eastern cultures would not consider themselves
as non-democratic, having universally elected parliaments in
their countries? In using such an acronym to characterize a popu-
lation sample, the authors must have a theory about what demo-
crats and a democracy mean. They must also have some intuition
as to what kind of impact such a regime might have on its citizens,
as opposed to another. The democratic criterion would deserve
more articulated rationale. It is not as easily measurable com-
pared to race, wealth, or education, yet it probably captures
something important. The question is what?
The name of the game in science is to generalize from limited
population samples: samples that are easily accessible, easy to
work with, and closer to the culture we as scientists know best.
In this respect, there is nothing wrong about ethnocentrism.
From such sampling we keep building paradigms on how “chil-
dren,” “folks,” and “the mind” work. In the scientiﬁc context,
the claim of universality is neither wrong nor presumptuous. It
is a goal and a measure of scientiﬁc truth. The problem is that
such a measure is always relative to its instrument.
What seems to be really wrong with a priori claims of univers-
ality is not the lack of population diversity, per se, as implied in
Heinrich et al. It is the use of Western “WEIRD” instruments
to measure behavioral phenomena across cultures. The use of
Westernized procedures and experimental paradigms thought
out to ﬁt Western intellectual ecology and preoccupations (e.g.,
two-dimensional symbolic optical illusions such as the Mu¨ller-
Lyer one, instead of ecologically more valid, hence potentially
more universal, optic phenomena such as the “moon illusion”;
the use of “weird” anonymous, and on the whole abstract, one-
shot economic games; “weird” abstract questionnaires and
other I.Q. testing) might well account for why typical Western
samples are systematic outliers displaying extreme, non-repre-
sentative behaviors. Behavioral sciences, historically a WEIRD
practice, create culturally speciﬁc objects and tools of investi-
gation to measure our predominantly WEIRD population
against other populations. This is the true guilty aspect of
ethnocentrism.
Last but not least, it is essential to distinguish levels at which
universality claims may apply. The macro levels of economic
games or self-assessment surveys are incommensurably more
subject to population variability compared to lower level pro-
cesses such as face recognition or emotional expression. This
needs to be taken into consideration, the problem being not
only how different populations are, but instead and more impor-
tantly, how populations vary in their distribution. But this
distribution certainly depends on whether we are dealing with
a low-level processing, such as emotion recognition, or higher
level, such as self-concept.
To conclude, it would be disingenuous to think that we are not
in the business of trying to approximate natural laws, whether
these laws account for the homogeneity or diversity (context
and culture dependence) of phenomena that, by consensus,
need to be falsiﬁable. This is the context in which scientiﬁc
claims of universality should be read and discussed. Whether
population variability is ignored or not, the assumption of uni-
versality is true until proven wrong. As in any scientiﬁc debate,
there is no end in sight.

Abstract: Although North American undergraduates represent about
0.2% of humanity, and a very unrepresentative subset, they actually
provide an advance look at what humanity is becoming. In the face of
globalization, this is all the more reason to study the wonderful variants
of the human condition before they become homogenized.
I am enthusiastically positive about Henrich et al.’s target article.
The message is central. Although the bottom line has been men-
tioned before in print by some of the authors and others (includ-
ing myself), never has it been so thoroughly documented and
elaborated into all the domains in which it is relevant. And
never so convincingly.
For studies of humans in their social world, the North Amer-
ican undergraduate (NAU) does not serve as the fruit ﬂy or
E. coli has served for genetics. But at the level of basic psycho-
logical processes, such as learning, motor organization, or
vision, the NAU is probably a pretty good fruit ﬂy. Many basic
psychological processes seem about the same in almost all
humans, and great progress made by psychologists in areas
such as vision can be attributed in large part to the appropriate-
ness of NAU subjects, as well as animal models, of course.
However, in the social world, in understanding humans as
whole creatures negotiating the world, the NAU is a very unfor-
tunate choice. Convenience, of course, is the justiﬁcation, and
this is very important; fruit ﬂies and E. coli are very convenient
ways to study genetics. North Americans constitute an atypical
5% of humanity, and North American freshmen and sophomores
at research universities constitute an even more atypical 0.1 or
0.2% of humanity. But even for North Americans, the freshman
or sophomore is very atypical, because this person is at a unique
life transition, between family life and an entirely peer-centered
life usually away from direct family inﬂuence. I have shown that
on a number of beliefs about the social world, the grandparents
of NAUs are as much like Asian Indian college students as they
are like their American grandchildren (Rozin 2003).
A sample of 30-year-old Americans would give us a much
better picture of American adulthood, because such individuals
usually have a reasonably settled life course and family. It is
ironic that the one special value of undergraduates for psychology
Commentary/Henrich et al.: The weirdest people in the world?

has to do with how humans, in one important cultural setting,
manage the transition
to
independence.
Psychologists, at
various points in time, have been interested in transition
periods such as weaning, toilet training, entry into the school
system, and adolescence. Here is another interesting transition
point that receives surprisingly little study, for a population
that is highly appropriate to examine human adaptation to
change.
But the main point of my commentary is that although the
NAU is truly anomalous, this subspecies of Homo sapiens is a
vision of the future. With the Internet, ready availability of infor-
mation of all sorts, computer ﬂuency as key to success in the
world, and ease in negotiating a world where text as opposed to
face-to-face interactions are the meat of human relationships,
the NAU is at the vanguard of what humans are going to be
like. So study of them has some justiﬁcation, not for understand-
ing the human condition now or in history, but as to what it may
become more like in the future. This is, as it were, a lucky break
for academic psychology, a consequence of globalization and the
computer/media revolution. Already, there has been a major
change in an important area of socialization. It is now parents
who are learning from their children how to navigate the Inter-
net, order online, and navigate the modern electronic world.
This is a real change in the direction of knowledge transmission.
Insofar as the social world has transmuted to email, Facebook,
and ordering online, it is the undergraduates who best illustrate
how humans will function. Globalization, the growing availability
of access to computers and the Internet, Internet dating services,
the decline of face-to-face markets, automated telephone
answering services, WalMart, and the like, are rapidly homogen-
izing the world, making more and more people like NAUs.
Because of globalization, it is especially important that
we understand now the different worlds that humans have
created – the physical worlds (e.g., cities, markets, architecture),
the institutional worlds, the social alliances, and the mental maps
of the world – before they become much more homogenized.
So the prescient virtues of the NAUs make it more important
that we fully explore human potential and human history at
this time. We don’t have much time, and the distinctive and
elaborated different cultural worlds of interpersonal interac-
tions, institutions, value systems, and the like, are a threatened
species. The wide range of cultures in the world are wonderful
and enlightening examples of the human condition and human
potential, and we should cherish them and rush to understand
them.
Donald Campbell’s doubt: Cultural difference
or failure of communication?

Abstract: The objection, rightfully noted but then dismissed by Henrich
et al., that the observed variation across populations “may be due to
various methodological artifacts that arise from translating experiments
across contexts” is a theoretically profound and potentially constructive
criticism. It parallels Donald Campbell’s concern that many cultural
differences
reported
by
psychologists
“come
from
failures
of
communication misreported as differences.” Ironically, Campbell’s
doubt is a good foundation for investigations in cultural psychology.
Near the end of the last essay ever written by the great psychol-
ogist Donald T. Campbell, one reads:
I would like to close . . . with a focus on the most ubiquitous source of
error in efforts to know the other. This is to interpret as a cultural
difference what is in reality a failure of communication. . . . I personally
am convinced that many of the cultural differences reported by psy-
chologists and others using questionnaires or tests come from failures
of communication misreported as differences. (Campbell 1996, p. 165)
I hope the present target article by Henrich et al. has an impact
on the way research is designed and reported in psychology: that
there will be more speciﬁcation of the boundary conditions for
generalizations about human behavior, a greater reluctance to
rush to claims about fundamental processes, and far less reliance
on collecting data from college undergraduates. Here I focus on
Don Campbell’s doubt. I suggest that the objection, rightfully
noted but then dismissed by Henrich et al., that “the observed
variation across populations may be due to various methodologi-
cal artifacts that arise from translating experiments across
contexts” (sect. 7.2, para. 2) is a theoretically profound and poten-
tially constructive criticism.
Evaluating claims to universality of psychological theories in
the light of cross- cultural evidence is of course not a new enter-
prise. An early example is Margaret Mead’s (1932) critique of
Jean Piaget’s claims in his book The Child’s Conception of the
World (Piaget 1929). Piaget described young Swiss children as
animistic and proposed a universal ontogenetic sequence in
which animism waned over time. Mead produced evidence
from a small-scale society in the Admiralty Islands suggesting
that among the Manus, the young children were dreary literalists
and only learned to be animists later in life. Henrich et al. write:
“As children already show large population-level differences, it is
not obvious that developmental work can substitute for research
across diverse human populations” (sect. 3.1, para. 5). Margaret
Mead would not be surprised.
An even earlier example is the 1895 Cambridge University
Torres Straits expedition headed by the anthropologist A. C.
Haddon, which set up an experimental psychological laboratory
in New Guinea (see Cole 1996). William McDougall ran exper-
imental tests of sensation concerning the limen of dual impression
upon the skin, using a small pair of carpenter’s dividers with
blunt metal points. Native subjects were asked to perform an
apparently straightforward task following an apparently easy-to-
translate instruction: to say “one” or “two” as they judged
whether one or two points touched the skin. McDougall reported
that “Murray Islanders have a threshold of tactile discrimination
of which the value, in terms of distance of two points touched, is
just about one half that of Englishmen, or we may say in other
words, that their power of tactile discrimination is about double
that of Englishmen” (quoted in Titchener 1916, p. 206).
The claim was challenged by E. B. Titchener, whose 1916
essay defending the proposition that “human nature is much
the same the world over” should be read by every anthropologist
and cultural psychologist who believes otherwise (and I am one of
them; see Shweder 1990; 1991; 2003). Titchener raised a series of
methodological objections, including the way subjects inter-
preted the purpose of the task. He argued that the subjects in
New Guinea, when deciding whether to report “one” or “two,”
were looking for “a sensation perceptively different from that
yielded by a single point,” which is not exactly the same as
looking for two distinct points of sensation. Educated English-
men, Titchener suggested, simply interpreted the notion of
duality of impression in a stricter sense. He judged that the evi-
dence from New Guinea did not show that the Murray Islanders’
powers of tactile discrimination were substantially different from
those of subjects in his own WEIRD (Western, Educated, Indus-
trial, Rich, and Democratic) society.
The relevant methodological point can be expressed this way:
Evidence of psychological differences between cultural groups
may simply (although signiﬁcantly) demonstrate that different
stimulus situations produce different responses. The identity of
a stimulus situation (e.g., an experimental task) does not exist
Commentary/Henrich et al.: The weirdest people in the world?
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:2/3
49

----- Page 50 (native) -----
independent of the subject’s interpretation of its meaning.
Hence, the more different the culture studied from the culture
where the stimulus situation was invented, the more likely the
meanings of the task will be harder to communicate with the
requisite exactitude in distant ﬁeld contexts.
A revealing illustration can be found in cross-cultural research
on the Ultimatum Game (see Henrich et al. 2005). Were cross-
cultural researchers working across 15 cultures in fact able to
standardize the practice and subjective meaning of “playing a
game with an anonymous other”? Consider, for example, the be-
havior of the Au and Gnau peoples of Papua New Guinea. Many
“proposers” offer more than 50% of the available currency. Many
of these offers are turned down by the “responder,” leaving both
“players” with nothing. The “WEIRD” populations of the world
don’t play that (apparently strange) way.
What description of goals, values, and pictures of the world can
help us understand what the stimulus situation actually meant to
those New Guinea subjects? Henrich et al. (2005) offer an expla-
nation: “The rejection of seemingly generous offers, of more than
half, may have a parallel in the culture of status-seeking through
gift-giving found in Au and Gnau villages, and throughout Mela-
nesia. In these societies, accepting gifts, even unsolicited ones,
implies a strong obligation to reciprocate at some future time”
(p. 811). Is that not prima facie evidence that the very idea of
playing with an anonymous other did not compute or translate
well in the mind or language of those non-WEIRD subjects,
and that in effect they were not playing the same game as the
one played by a typical “weird” American college student?
Indeed, the very idea of cultural difference might well be
described as not playing the same game. Hence, we learn
much
about
the
culture-speciﬁc
mentality
of
Melanesian
peoples by trying to give a “thick description” of their local
goals, values, and pictures of the world, so as to understand
how and why the Ultimatum Game becomes a different stimulus
situation (a different affordance, if you prefer that concept) as it
crosses borders and travels around the world. I suspect Don
Campbell would have been pleased to see the ﬁeld of cultural
psychology built on the basis of his methodological doubts.
Philosophy and WEIRD intuition

Abstract: From Plato to the present, philosophers have relied on
intuitive judgments as evidence for or against philosophical theories.
Most philosophers are WEIRD, highly educated, and male. The
literature reviewed in the target article suggests that such people might
have intuitions that differ from those of people in other groups. There
is a growing body of evidence suggesting that they do.
In the opening pages of Plato’s Republic, Cephalus suggests that
what justice requires is speaking the truth and paying one’s debts.
But Socrates immediately offers a thought experiment to show
that Cephalus’s account of justice is not correct:
Suppose that a friend when in his right mind has deposited arms with
me and he asks for them when he is not in his right mind, ought I to
give them back to him? No one would say that I ought or that
I should be right in doing so, any more than they would say that I
ought always to speak the truth to one who is in his condition. (Plato
1892, The Republic, Book I, p. 331)
When Cephalus agrees, Socrates concludes that “speaking the
truth and paying your debts” is not an adequate account of justice.
Philosophy has changed in many ways in the 2,400 years since
Plato wrote the Republic, but the method Plato uses in this
passage is still one of the most basic tools in the philosopher’s
toolkit. Although there is some debate about how, exactly, the
method should be characterized, the basic outlines are clear
enough. A philosopher describes a real, or more often an imagin-
ary, situation and asks his audience whether the people or objects
or events described have some philosophically important property
or relation: Is the agent’s action unjust? Was it morally wrong to
push the large man off the footbridge to stop a trolley that
would otherwise kill ﬁve people? (Thomson 1976) Does the
person who holds a ticket in a lottery where the odds are one in
a thousand know that the ticket won’t win? (Kyburg 1961,
p. 197; see also Hawthorne 2004). Does the “Chinese Room”
understand the story? (Searle 1980) When things go well (as
they always did in Plato’s dialogues!), the audience will agree
that the answer is intuitively obvious, and the philosopher will
conclude that the content of these intuitive judgments is probably
true. If it is intuitively obvious that it is wrong to push the man off
the footbridge, and that is what the philosopher’s theory entails,
then this counts as evidence for his theory. If it is intuitively
obvious that the Chinese Room does not understand the story
or have other intentional states, but a philosopher’s theory
entails that it does, this counts as evidence against his theory.
The overwhelming majority of philosophers who use this
method are WEIRD. Moreover, as reﬂected in my choice of pro-
nouns, the majority of those who teach in North American and
European philosophy departments are male. And, of course, on
at least one dimension, professional philosophers are extreme
outliers among WEIRD people, as most of them have undergone
ﬁve or more years of training and vetting in one of the 30 or 40
leading graduate programs. About a decade ago, as we became
acquainted with the emerging literature reviewed by Henrich
et al., my colleagues and I began to wonder whether these
WEIRD philosophers might have weird philosophical intui-
tions – intuitions that differed from those of people who did
not share their cultural and educational background. To ﬁnd
out, we did something philosophers often do – we scoured the
literature. We also did something that philosophers rarely do:
We designed and ran our own experiments aimed at ﬁnding
out whether people who were not WEIRD shared the intuitions
that play such a central role in Western philosophy.
Although this work is still in its infancy, I think it has begun to
provide an important addendum to Henrich et al.’s survey
suggesting that, in a number of areas of philosophy, the intuitions
of philosophically trained, WEIRD males are indeed quite differ-
ent from the intuitions of people in other cultural groups. Space
does not permit an exhaustive discussion of the literature, but
here are some of the highpoints.
Epistemology.
1. Weinberg et al. (2001) and Nichols et al. (2003),
showed that American students of European ancestry and American stu-
dents of East Asian ancestry have different intuitions about a variety of
thought experiments that have played a central role in contemporary phil-
osophy. They also report differences in intuitions between high- and low-
socioeconomic status (SES) participants, where years of education was
the major determinant in classifying a participant as high or low SES.
2. Starmans and Friedman (2009) found a large gender difference in
intuitions on a “Gettier” case similar to those that are widely discussed
in the philosophical literature. In recent years, there has been growing
concern about the under-representation of women in philosophy
(Haslanger 2008). Though the phenomenon almost certainly has many
causes, this striking ﬁnding suggests one that most philosophers have
been loathe to consider: Many women students may have intuitions
that differ from those their male professors insist are correct.
Ethics.
1. The classic work of Brandt (1954) reports some dramatic
differences between the moral judgments of Hopi people and white Amer-
icans that apparently cannot be explained by differences in factual beliefs.
2. Abarbanell and Houser (in press) report that in a variety of carefully
controlled experiments, rural Mayan participants did not exhibit the
Commentary/Henrich et al.: The weirdest people in the world?

BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:2/3

----- Page 51 (native) -----
“omission” bias that has been widely documented in a number of large-
scale societies.
Philosophy of language. Machery et al. (2004) report that
Hong Kong Chinese and Americans of European ancestry have
different intuitions on a thought experiment that has played a
central role in the philosophical theory of reference. Deutsch
et al. (in preparation) reinforce these ﬁndings, and Machery
et al. (2009) include a preliminary report of additional studies
in Mongolia, India, and France. (For further discussion, see
Machery’s commentary.)
There is no shortage of debate about the robustness of these
ﬁndings and about their implications for the viability of the
venerable philosophical practice of using WEIRD people’s intui-
tions as evidence (Mallon et al. 2009; Sosa 2009; Stich 2009). My
own view is that these studies pose a major challenge to that prac-
tice, because, when the intuitions of different groups diverge,
there is no reason to think that WEIRD people’s intuitions are
more likely to be true.

processes”; (4) address concerns that the patterns we highlight

question of explaining why WEIRD people are psychologically

nature needs to integrate a variety of methods and apply them to
diverse populations, well beyond the WEIRD samples it has
largely relied upon.
Frankly, we are stunned. We expected that our target
article would provoke ferocious counter-attacks among a
substantial cross-section of researchers from several
ﬁelds. Awaiting the commentaries, we steeled ourselves,
bracing for harsh and relentless rebukes. One renowned
social psychologist, who had read an early draft, warned
us that our colleagues would probably spit on us. What
arrived were 28 commentaries from an esteemed and
diverse set of scholars, including anthropologists, econom-
ists, linguists, neuroscientists, philosophers, primatologists,
and sociologists, as well as cognitive, developmental, per-
sonality, and social psychologists. These commentaries
largely cohere as an emerging synthesis, offering important
expansions and extensions of our argument, as well as
raising several interesting points for debate and discussion.
There is now sufﬁcient evidence from diverse human
populations to indicate that researchers can no longer con-
tinue to – explicitly or implicitly – infer the universality of
psychological processes or behavior from studying only
WEIRD people and their children. Our reading indicates
that 23 of 28 commentaries largely support our main
thesis, although they raise important issues and fruitful
points for debate. Of the remaining ﬁve, only one is in deci-
sive disagreement (Gaertner, Sedikides, Cai, & Brown
[Gaertner et al.]), with the other four (Khemlani, Lee,
& Bucciarelli [Khemlani et al.], Machery, Maryanski,
and Shweder) seeming somewhat ambiguous or ambiva-
lent as to their precise views. Of course, it is possible that
those who disagree most strongly with our assessment
chose not to comment. We look forward to engaging repre-
sentatives of this position in the future.
Our reply is ordered as follows: We (1) consolidate the
additional lines of evidence, extensions, and ampliﬁcations
of our target piece made by various commentators; (2)
discuss the importance of integrating experimental and eth-
nographic methods, and show how researchers using behav-
ioral games have done precisely this; (3) present our
concerns with arguments from several commentators that
separate “content” and “representations” from “compu-
tations,” “learning,” or “basic” psychological processes; (4)
address concerns that the patterns we highlight marking
WEIRD people as psychological outliers arise from aspects
of researchers and the research process; (5) respond to
Gaertner et al.’s claim that being members of the same
species means we must have the same invariant psychologi-
cal processes; (6) address criticisms of our categories and
rhetorical strategy; and (7) return brieﬂy to the question of
explaining why WEIRD people are psychologically unusual.
R1. Additional evidence, extensions, and
ampliﬁcations
Here we consolidate additional evidence, extensions, and
ampliﬁcations of our target article. Seven commentaries
reviewed empirical evidence that we did not present. All of
this evidence supports the notion that WEIRD people are
unusual, and none of it challenges that claim. Several of
these lines of evidence are complementary with each other,
and suggest some theoretical reasons for the unusual
nature of WEIRD people, an issue that we return to in the
ﬁnal section. Nine additional commentaries supplied insight-
ful ampliﬁcations, nuances, or extensions of our efforts.
R1.1. Additional support for the argument that WEIRD
populations are unusual
1. Chiao & Cheon point out that the vast majority of
cognitive neuroscience ﬁndings are based on WEIRD
brains. They then review ﬁndings from the nascent ﬁeld
of cultural neuroscience showing how population-level
differences in experimental ﬁndings reveal themselves in
Response/Henrich et al.: The weirdest people in the world?

brain activity. Some of the psychological differences we
discussed regarding the self and holistic versus analytic
reasoning can be observed in differential patterns of
brain activation. These commentators also highlight differ-
ences in brain activation based on socioeconomic status.
Their commentary underscores the point that neither
imaging brains nor measuring hormones allows one to
avoid the challenge of population-level variation. More-
over, because sophisticated cultural learning is an aspect
of the evolved human repertoire, our brains are partially
self-programmable, so even cultural differences are bio-
logical differences (though not genetic differences) – for
example, see Nisbett and Cohen (1996).
2. Majid & Levinson emphasize the importance of con-
sidering the world’s immense linguistic diversity for studying
and theorizing about psychology, especially in light of the
unusual nature of English on several important dimensions
(e.g., see next item). They also highlight additional evidence
indicating how deeply some aspects of language imprint
themselves on nonlinguistic aspects of cognition. They
point to the uncanny coincidence that the fundamental
stock of prelinguistic concepts hypothesized by cognitive
scientists corresponds closely to those available in English
– the language of many of the researchers and most of the
participants – but not to those found in other languages.
3. Amplifying Majid & Levinson’s points with
further examples, Machery and Stich discuss studies in
America, France, Mongolia, India, and China showing
that people have different philosophical intuitions, with
English-speakers (and Americans) at one end of the spec-
trum and Chinese at the other. Apparently, some philoso-
phical theories of reference are based on these “English
intuitions.”
4. Stich, in considering the implications of our efforts
for philosophy, highlights novel work from experimental
philosophy showing population-level differences in philo-
sophical intuitions and moral judgments, including a
recent ﬁnding on the lack of any “omission bias” in the
moral judgments of Mayans. This lack of omission bias
contradicts previous claims of universality based on work
done purely in industrialized populations (and on the
Internet).
These
initial
ﬁndings,
if
replicated
and
extended, suggest that important elements of philosophi-
cal theorizing and conceptual analysis are rooted in local
folk intuitions that do not extend to the rest of humanity.
5. Karasik, Adolph, Tamis-LeMonda, & Bornstein
(Karasik et al.) review evidence on differences in motor
development across human populations, and recent data
linking developmental differences to childrearing prac-
tices. They also highlight how, in some cases, different
developmental trajectories arrive at the same outcome.
6. Fernald, in underlining the extreme narrowness of
the
samples
used
by
developmental
psychologists,
reviews evidence linking socioeconomic status, early cogni-
tive stimulation, and long-term cognitive outcomes. Since
most developmental work is with infants from WEIRD
families, the oft-highlighted developmental milestones for
various cognitive and linguistic abilities may reside at the
extreme end of the true underlying species distribution.
7. Lancy reviews both ethnographic and experimental
work on children from across diverse human populations
showing just how unusual the worlds are of children who
grow up in WEIRD societies, and how different their cog-
nitive development can be.
R1.2. Extensions of our points
Here we lay out ﬁve different ways in which various
commentators highlighted, ampliﬁed, and extended our
efforts.
R1.2.1. Dealing
with
the
predominance
of
WEIRD
researchers. One important issue that we were not able
to spend much space on in our target article revolves
around the fact that most researchers are themselves
WEIRD people. This directly impacts the choice of
subject
pools,
since
many
researchers
study
those
around them. However, this also may impact theory build-
ing and experimental design in a number of ways (e.g.,
Majid & Levinson, Stich). First, Fessler emphasizes
how researchers use their own intuitions, at least at the
start, in either theory-building or experimental design.
His discussion of research on shame shows how American
cultural models of emotion lead to basic elements of this
emotion being missed by U. S. researchers, despite the
fact that these elements are highly salient elsewhere. He
argues that researchers, at least for some topics, would
be better off not studying people who are culturally
similar to themselves. Second, Bennis & Medin worry
about this same point, arguing that researchers’ cultural
biases inﬂuence the choice of topics and phenomena
that are considered interesting. Further magnifying the
problem, instruments are then developed and honed in
particular populations, which may not be suitable to
other populations (also see Rochat). Finally, Meadon &
Spurrett suggest that one important way of addressing
these challenges is to bring more non-WEIRD researchers
into the process. Empirical ﬁndings should be peer
reviewed by researchers who bring different cultural
models and implicit expectations to the problem.
We agree with all these suggestions: Researchers can
view phenomena from a novel perspective, not con-
strained by their own intuitions, when they study those
from other cultures, and can potentially discover phenom-
ena that they otherwise would not see. However, we
disagree with an extreme version of this argument, which
proposes that researchers should entirely avoid studying
people from their own culture. Researcher’s intuitions
about the ways people in their own cultures think can be
a useful source of understanding in building theories and
in honing research instruments. More non-WEIRD
researchers should be brought into the discussion, as well
as onto collaborative research teams. Research teams
themselves that better reﬂect broad global diversity can
more effectively address the challenges delineated by
Fessler, Rochat, and Bennis & Medin.
With regard to these points, it is instructive to consider
why psychology is more dominated by American research
than any other science (May 1997). One possibility is that
pursuing a career in psychology is a luxury that people
cannot afford until the countries and societies in which
they live have achieved sufﬁcient economic development.
This may be part of the explanation, although this would
not explain why universities in wealthy societies like
those of Japan and Western Europe typically have

proportionately
smaller
complements
of
psychology
researchers and majors than do North American univer-
sities. Another possibility, which we highlight here, is
that the ﬁeld’s emphasis on WEIRD samples, coupled
with the guiding assumption of universal psychological
processes, tends to unintentionally marginalize inter-
national research. If non-WEIRD researchers are inter-
ested in extending ﬁndings initially established with
WEIRD samples in their home populations, such as ﬁnd-
ings associated with motivations for self-enhancement,
they may well be unable to replicate the American
results. The implicit assumption that self-enhancement
motivations are similar everywhere would suggest that
such failed replications are not due to the nature of the
samples studied but instead due to some kind of unspeci-
ﬁed deﬁciency in the methods of the non-WEIRD
researchers.
American
researchers
have
a
distinct
advantage in that the ﬁeld’s key theories were largely
constructed on data from American participants, and we
suggest that this is likely why American research constitu-
tes 70% of the ﬁeld’s citations. International research
suffers from the disadvantage of trying to extend Ameri-
can-based theories with participants who often have differ-
ent psychological tendencies, yielding results that are
difﬁcult to interpret while embracing an untested assump-
tion of universal psychological processes. In contrast, if the
ﬁeld comes to recognize that psychological phenomena
cannot be assumed to be universal until demonstrated as
such, then research conducted by non-WEIRD research-
ers, guided by non-WEIRD intuitions, and studied with
non-WEIRD samples, would come to be viewed as par-
ticularly important for understanding human psychology.
R1.2.2. Existential proofs. Ga¨chter’s commentary also
extends one of our discussion points by underlining the
fact that, depending on the research question, WEIRD
subjects may be suitable, or even ideal. In our target
article we wrote that
Research programs that are seeking existential proofs for
psychological or behavioral phenomena, such as in the case
of altruistic punishment discussed earlier (e.g., Fehr &
Ga¨chter 2002), could certainly start with WEIRD samples.
That is, if the question is whether a certain phenomenon can
be found in humans at all, reliance on any slice of humanity
would be a legitimate sampling strategy. (sect. 7.1.6)
We pointed both to Kahneman and Tverky’s work on
rationality (e.g., Gilovich et al. 2002) and to Rozin’s work
on magical thinking (Rozin & Nemeroff 1990) to highlight
situations in which WEIRD samples are either suitable or
ideal. However, if one’s goal is ultimately to construct
(rather than tactically falsify) theories of human behavior,
it is hard to see how that could be done without expanding
beyond WEIRD subjects.
R1.2.3. Differences among chimpanzee populations. Two
commentaries expand on one of our points (Note 14 of the
target article) by highlighting the challenge that popu-
lation-level psychological variation creates for programs
comparing
humans
and
chimpanzees
(Boesch
and
Leavens, Bard, & Hopkins [Leavens et al.]). Applying
our argument to chimpanzees (though not to other
animals?), these commentaries make the point that chim-
panzee populations may also vary in their psychological
abilities and motivations, and that this difference is impor-
tant for comparing wild and captive populations.
Broadly speaking, we agree with this point and feel it
needs careful attention. Nevertheless, we offer some cau-
tionary notes. First, there are both theoretical and empiri-
cal reasons to believe that human population-level
psychological variation is substantially greater than that
found in chimpanzees. While chimpanzees are a cultural
species, with local traditions and some imitative abilities
(Horner & Whiten 2005; Whiten et al. 1999), humans
are a runaway hyper-cultural species whose genetic
endowments, including abilities to adapt ontogenetically,
have been shaped by a long history of cumulative cultural
evolution, social norms, institutions, and culture-gene coe-
volution (Henrich 2008; Laland et al. 2010; Richerson &
Boyd 2005). With the same basic genetic endowments,
humans expanded as foragers to all major continents,
across substantial bodies of ocean, and into an immense
diversity
of
environments.
Meanwhile,
chimpanzees
remained stuck in a narrow band of African tropical
forests. The impact of culture-gene coevolution has
become increasingly clear from studies of the human
genome (Laland et al. 2010). Therefore, although we
agree that understanding chimpanzees also requires the
study of diverse samples, we suspect that population-
level variation is a far more signiﬁcant issue for under-
standing
human
psychology
than
for
understanding
chimpanzee psychology.
Second, we note that it is far from clear which way the
use of captive chimpanzees in psychological experiments
might bias empirical ﬁndings. The aforementioned two
commentaries provide opposing claims on this issue.
Boesch suggests that if populations of human foragers
were compared with wild chimpanzees, then the observed
psychological and motivational differences would be mini-
mized because of the impoverished social environments of
captive chimpanzees and the unusual psychology of
WEIRD people. Leavens et al., somewhat contrastingly,
summarize evidence indicating that captive and human-
reared chimpanzees have declarative pointing abilities
more similar to humans (or at least to their human
captors) than is found in wild chimpanzees. This suggests
that captive chimpanzees may be more similar to some
humans than to wild chimpanzees. It certainly seems
plausible that life with humans might make chimpanzees
more similar to humans, not less. This remains an
open and important question, the answer to which is
likely to vary depending on the phenomenon under
investigation.
Finally, some of Boesch’s speciﬁc indictments are off
the mark. For example, he suggests that Silk et al. (2005)
designed experiments with the “ethnocentric assumption
that sharing should be preferred over nonsharing,” and
then afﬁrmatively cites Henrich et al.’s (2006) work,
which argues that these differences result from different
culturally evolved norms. It turns out, however, that
Henrich was a co-investigator on both projects, and that
these chimpanzee experiments were designed with full
knowledge of the cross-cultural results, and precisely to
test the “cultural norms” hypothesis against alternatives.
Moreover, these experiments were done with chimpan-
zees in Louisiana, which Boesch criticizes, but were also
replicated in Bastrop, Texas, prior to publication (Silk
et al. 2005), and then replicated again in Leipzig (Jensen
Response/Henrich et al.: The weirdest people in the world?
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:2/3

et al. 2006). Despite the substantial variation in the social
environments of these chimpanzee populations, the exper-
imental results were identical in all three sites. Finally,
although differences between captive and wild chimpan-
zees may be important, there is nothing inconsistent
about ﬁeld observations of chimpanzee cooperation and
Silk et al.’s experimental results. Pure self-interest can
generate plenty of sharing and cooperation in some con-
texts, and seems to explain much about chimpanzees’
social behavior (Gilby 2006; Tennie et al. 2009).
R1.2.4. Generalizing across contexts. The commentaries
by both Konecˇni and Ceci, Kahan, & Braman (Ceci
et al.) call attention to another concern regarding general-
izability: How well do research ﬁndings generalize beyond
the methods that are used to test speciﬁc hypotheses in
laboratory settings? Relatedly, Rochat argues that the
choice of narrowly conceived psychological instruments
may limit the generalization of ﬁndings, as well. We
agree with Konecˇni, Ceci et al., and Rochat that there
are potential artifacts underlying the ﬁndings of many
experimental
paradigms.
Highlighting
the
need
to
broaden participant samples does not obviate the need
for researchers to study their phenomena with a variety
of methods and in different contexts to assess whether
their ﬁndings are meaningful and generalizable.
R1.2.5. Implications beyond the laboratory. The unusual
nature of WEIRD samples is not solely a problem for
researchers; it has implications that extend well beyond
the laboratory. We think that Konecˇni is correct in high-
lighting how automatic assumptions of psychological
universality can be problematic when people from one
society apply and enforce new norms and policies in
another society. As he notes, there can be enormous
costs in “the deliberate or unconscious incorporation of
WEIRD-based ﬁndings into the normative expectations
held by international bodies in ‘cognitively distant’ war-
torn areas – such as in Rwanda.” International interven-
tions that are based on WEIRD research, or inspired by
untested universalist assumptions, may generate ineffec-
tive and potentially destructive policies.
We emphasize, however, that an awareness of popu-
lation variability is not a call for unbridled cultural relati-
vism. Findings that reveal population differences do not
imply an absence of a universal human nature, but they
do indicate that what is universal might not be the same
as what emerges from WEIRD participants. The investi-
gation of universals can play a central role in the endeavor
to manage international disputes and humanitarian crises,
because they stand to possibly provide the only legitimate
criteria by which any particular cultural practice or belief
system may be understood. As Fox (1973, p. 13) has
argued, “We could not plead against inhuman tyrannies
if we did not know what is inhuman.” Understanding
what is human or inhuman necessarily requires studying
people from a diversity of populations.
Theories based on narrow sampling also have disturbing
implications for the ﬁeld of psychiatry and the treatment of
mental health across diverse cultural contexts. As in the
behavioral sciences, psychiatric models have largely been
constructed on an empirical foundation that was gathered
from WEIRD people. The burgeoning ﬁeld of cultural
psychiatry (Tseng 2001), however, has revealed that
many disorders have distinct cultural boundaries, and
can best be understood as culture-bound syndromes,
such as (1) bulimia nervosa in the West (Keel & Klump
2003), (2) hikikomori in Japan (Sakai et al. 2004), and (3)
koro in Southeast Asia (Ngui 1969). Moreover, many uni-
versal mental disorders manifest themselves in quite dis-
tinct ways across populations, such that presentations of
depression (Kleinman 1988), social anxiety disorder
(Okazaki 1997), or even schizophrenia (WHO 1973) are
associated with different symptoms and prognoses. In his
recent book, Crazy Like Us: The Globalization of the
American Psyche, Watters (2010) documents how psychia-
try has been exporting American models of psychopathol-
ogies around the world, such as post-traumatic stress
syndrome to Sri Lanka, anorexia nervosa to Hong Kong,
and depression to Japan, often with disastrous conse-
quences. The problem lies in diagnosing and treating indi-
genous presentations of pathologies according to how they
appear through the prisms of the culturally limited diag-
nostic categories of the American Psychiatric Association’s
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
which often increases the distress for both the patient
and the community. When real-life interventions are
based on a body of research – however extensive – that
is disproportionately drawn from WEIRD samples, the
implications extend far beyond the accuracy of our the-
ories and into human lives.
R2. Methods for an interdisciplinary science of
human behavior
We agree with Rai & Fiske, Astuti & Bloch, and Shweder
that a fully interdisciplinary study of human psychology
demands an integration of ethnographic and experimental
methods.
Panchanathan,
Frankenhuis,
&
Barrett
(Panchanathan et al.) also recognize the need for research
that goes beyond disciplinary boundaries. Experimental
methods provide instruments for better measurement and
permit the testing of causal hypotheses. Ethnographic
methods provide crucial insights for developing theory,
designing experiments, and interpreting results, as well as
important information for understanding the proximate
causes (e.g., ontogenetic processes) of psychological differ-
ences (Henrich & Henrich 2007, Ch. 1). However, because
our target article was aimed principally at experimentalists,
we wrote in the language of experiments. Too often, ethno-
graphers have railed against experiments, but little com-
munication has occurred because ethnographers generally
have refused to become ﬂuent in the local language of
experimental thought (which is ironic).
There are important differences here, however. Our
own view is more in line with Rai & Fiske, than with
Astuti & Bloch and Shweder, who seem to be emphasiz-
ing an approach based on qualitative ethnography with an
emphasis on “thick description.” Ethnographic work must
be based on systemic, quantitative, and replicable research
protocols that quantify the theoretically relevant aspects of
life. Alongside in-depth interviews and participant obser-
vation, this might involve time allocation, systematic
observation,
social
network
measures, conversational
recordings, and formal cognitive tasks (e.g., pile sorts).
The integration of experimental techniques with ethnogra-
phy will partially return anthropology to its broader scope,
Response/Henrich et al.: The weirdest people in the world?
54
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:2/3

----- Page 55 (native) -----
prior to the intellectually destructive epidemic of postmo-
dernism (Slingerland 2008). As Shweder points out, ﬁeld
anthropologists used to integrate experiments with ethno-
graphy (e.g., Edgerton 1971; Mead 1932; Rivers 1901b).
What we do not need is greater reliance on ethnographic
impressionism, which delivers such spectacles as the
Mead-Freeman-Orans debate (Freeman et al. 2000) on
the nature of Samoan adolescent sexuality.
In the 21st century, scattered teams of highly interdisci-
plinary researchers have already begun to demonstrate
how to integrate ethnographic and experimental ﬁndings
in a manner that takes advantage of their synergies,
going well beyond “thick description” (e.g., Atran et al.
1999; 2005; Barrett & Behne 2005; Cohen 2007; Fessler
2004; Henrich et al. 2005a; 2006; Henrich & Henrich
2007). In Section R2.1 below, we discuss Foundations of
Human Sociality: Economic Experiments and Ethno-
graphic Evidence from Fifteen Small-Scale Societies
(Henrich et al. 2004), which explicitly integrates insights
from long-term ﬁeldwork with ﬁndings from behavioral
games.
R2.1. Meanings and misunderstandings: Behavioral
game experiments
In expressing concerns about how experimental partici-
pants from diverse societies interpret or conceptualize
particular experiments, some commentators have criti-
cized the use of “economic games” across diverse societies
(Shweder, Rai & Fiske, Baumard & Sperber, and
Astuti & Bloch). We address these speciﬁc issues in two
ways. First, we show how these criticisms arise from an
incomplete reading of the work that has been done using
economic games across diverse populations. Second, we
use these cross-cultural game projects as an example of
how in-depth ethnographic studies can be combined
with experimental tools by interdisciplinary teams to
address important theoretical questions.
Understanding the utility of an experiment requires
understanding the theoretical debates that those exper-
iments aim to address. The Roots of Human Sociality
Project, which consists of two phases of experiments and
ethnography
performed
in
22
different
small-scale
societies by a team of anthropologists, psychologists, and
economists (see Henrich et al. 2001; 2006; 2010), was
designed to examine particular hypotheses related to the
evolution of large-scale complex human societies. One
hypothesis for the emergence of large-scale human
societies proposes that cultural evolution, driven by com-
petition among societies and institutions, favored the evol-
ution of particular kinds of social norms. These norms
harness and extend evolved social motivations to foster
cooperation, trust, and exchange with ephemeral partners,
beyond each individual’s stable local network of kin and
repeat interactants. Such norms permitted the formation
of market institutions, which encourage market expansion,
trade, and economic success. Psychologically, this hypoth-
esis suggests that the inhabitants of large-scale, complex,
market-integrated societies will possess default sets of pro-
social beliefs, motivations, and expectations about how to
treat ephemeral interactants (e.g., strangers or anonymous
others). Under this view, the institutions of complex
societies, such as markets, ought to correlate positively
with prosocial behavior in these contexts.
An alternative hypothesis proposes that cooperation,
trust, and exchange in large-scale societies result directly
from the misapplication of evolved kin- and reciprocity-
based heuristics for interacting in small-scale societies to
individuals in larger social spheres (Burnham & Johnson
2005; Dawkins 2006), eventually including nation states.
These heuristics for life in small-scale societies, which
are not favored by natural selection in large-scale societies,
misﬁre in large-scale societies because these societies have
spread only in the last 10 millennia. Crucial to this hypoth-
esis is that cultural evolution cannot substantially alter
the social motivations and calculations that determine
sociality.
These two hypotheses make quite different predictions
about the context-speciﬁc behavior and motivations of
people
from
different
societies
toward
ephemeral
interactants.
What kind of experiments might allow us to measure
these differences? Ideally, the experiments should have
real costs and beneﬁts with the same underlying material
payoffs, so we can comparatively measure motivations
and expectations. However, there ought to be cues that
will tap the predicted sets of context-speciﬁc motivations
and expectations (norms) for interacting with individuals
in the absence of information about their particular
relationships (e.g., cues about status, sex, kinship, or
future interaction). With their salient cues of cash and
anonymity, and their lack of other cues, economic games
seem ideally suited for testing the above hypotheses
(Henrich et al. 2010).
From the beginning, the Roots team leaders knew that
deploying these experiments across diverse societies
would be challenging, requiring experts on each local
culture
and
qualitative
ethnographic
information
to
assess local meanings and interpretations. Long-term
anthropological ﬁeldworkers were recruited to design
and implement the protocols. Although the Phase I ﬁnd-
ings did show that market integration was indeed impor-
tant for predicting prosociality in these contexts, there
were also a few cases in which the experiments happened
to cue local prosocial norms – interpretations or meaning
systems – unrelated to the targeted set of default norms
for exchanging with strangers or anonymous others. The
project team attended to these alternative interpretations,
arguing that it is essential to understand the mapping
between the experiments and local norms (Alvard 2004;
Ensminger 2004; Henrich & Smith 2004; Hill & Gurven
2004); they also captured much of this variation with
a variable related to non-market cooperative domains in
their statistical analyses. The observation of how daily
life inﬂuences the experiments was so important that it
was one of the ﬁve major points in the team’s 2005 BBS
paper (Henrich et al. 2005a). Each ethnographer also
wrote a chapter in Foundations of Human Sociality: Econ-
omic Experiments and Ethnographic Evidence and in
Fifteen Small-Scale Societies, in which they deployed
their own interviews, participant observation, and years
of ethnographic experience to illuminate the local mean-
ings of our experiments.
An important example of this focus on understanding
local meanings comes from the team’s investigation of
their experimental ﬁndings from the Au of New Guinea
(see Shweder). This investigation began when ethnogra-
pher David Tracer, who speaks Au and had been
Response/Henrich et al.: The weirdest people in the world?
BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES (2010) 33:2/3
55

----- Page 56 (native) -----
working in New Guinea for 12 years prior to the Roots
collaboration, published two papers illuminating his exper-
imental ﬁndings (Tracer 2003; 2004). To further address
this in Phase II, the Roots team recruited another long-
term linguistically skilled New Guinea ethnographer,
Alex Bolyanatz. In this second phase, Tracer replicated
and extended his prior ﬁndings, while Bolyanatz returned
home with ﬁndings parallel to those of Tracer (Bolyanatz,
under review; Tracer et al., under review). It seems likely
that in New Guinea, behavioral games map onto prosocial
norms that have little or nothing to do with markets or
complex societies. This is consistent with decades of ethno-
graphy emphasizing the broad-ranging importance of reci-
procity norms in New Guinea (Fiske 1991; Sillitoe 1998).
After the Phase I ﬁndings became known, many
researchers expressed the same concerns that have been
highlighted by commentators Baumard & Sperber,
who write “participants in these games have no infor-
mation about the rights of each player over the stake and
are asked to make a ‘blind’ decision. But who owns the
money? . . . Who is the other participant? . . . Does he or
she have rights over the money?” Whereas the Roots
team argued against these concerns for Phase I (Henrich
et al. 2005b), Phase II’s design directly and explicitly
addressed them in the standardized game instructions,
pre-game tests of participants’ understanding, post-game
interviews on game interpretations, contextualized game
variants, and games with double-blind anonymous part-
ners. Phase II’s results replicated and extended the
Phase I ﬁndings in various ways, showing that, among
other things, the modiﬁcations made to address the con-
cerns raised by Baumard & Sperber have little impact
on the results (Henrich & Ensminger, n.d.; Henrich
et al. 2006; 2010).
Rai & Fiske suggest the experimental games are not
meaningful because they do not correlate with anything
important in the real world (Levitt & List 2007). They
cite Gurven and Winking (2008), who show that socializ-
ing, food-sharing, beer-brewing, and well-digging are not
correlated with three bargaining experiments among the
Tsimane in Bolivia. We question what theory predicts
that those domains should be correlated? The above
described evolutionary approach to social norms predicts
that, if game play does indeed tap norms evolved for inter-
acting with strangers or anonymous others, then the games
played by Gurven and Winking ought to be associated with
things such as market integration, social scale (community
size), and other features related to the operation of larger-
scale societies – features that capture those elements of
social interactions not governed by durable personal
relationships. Looking across diverse populations, market
integration is indeed highly correlated with experimental
measures of prosocial behavior in these bargaining
games (Henrich et al. 2010). Similarly, antisocial punish-
ment (Figure 3 in the target article) is highly negatively
correlated with GDP (gross domestic product), and pre-
dicted by national measures of the strength of the rule of
law and measures of norms of civic cooperation (Herr-
mann et al. 2008). Within populations, trust game
measures of trustworthiness predict repaying loans in a
microﬁnance program (Karlan 2005), and predict alumni
donations (Baran et al. 2009). Dictator game offers are cor-
related with donations to hurricane victims (Kam et al.,
n.d.) and political participation (Fowler & Kam 2007).
Once properly theorized, not only are economic games
highly correlated with important real-world phenomena,
but we can predict with which real-world phenomena
they should correlate.
R2.2. Merely methodological artifacts?
Beyond economic games, Shweder, as well as Baumard
& Sperber, ask whether the population-level variations
found in the psychological literature we reviewed are a
product of methodological artifacts arising from different
meanings assigned to the experimental settings, or from
communication failures between researchers and partici-
pants. Could it be that, for example, the extensive cogni-
tive differences we reviewed in perceptual judgments,
visual illusions, analytic-holistic thinking, and folkbiologi-
cal reasoning arise not from differences in cognitive
processes, but from different interpretations of the ques-
tions or the tasks?
While we agree that researchers working across popu-
lations
should
take
such
methodological
concerns
seriously, several lines of evidence speak against this
being a general problem. First, we emphasize that
diverse methodological techniques have often been used
that yield consistent ﬁndings. For example, Western par-
ticipants are found to privilege analytic cognitive strategies,
whether the tasks measure reaction times in categorization,
free recall, patterns of bias in deductive reasoning, or eye
tracking in scene recognition. It is hard to see how task
interpretation or meaning issues would affect all of these
tasks and yield responses in the same direction as the pre-
dicted differences in cognitive processes. Moreover,
many of the psychological studies we included in our
review (Choi & Nisbett 1998; Norenzayan et al. 2002)
included control conditions in which there were no popu-
lation-level differences, and none were expected. This
helps establish the meaning equivalence of the experi-
mental contexts and procedures across populations, and
undermines a purely methodological interpretation of
differences found. Finally, it is important to recognize
that the same or similar methods and instruments that
have revealed population-level differences have also
revealed population-level invariances, often in the same
study with the same participants (Atran & Medin 2008;
Atran et al. 2005; Haun et al. 2006; Henrich et al. 2006;
Norenzayan et al. 2002; Segall et al. 1966). As we point
out in our target article, if certain methods count toward
establishing invariant aspects of psychological processes,
then data that indicate variation have to count as well.
As an illustration, consider recent work showing both
universal and variable aspects of numerical cognition. In
contrast to evidence from WEIRD samples, experimental
work from two small-scale Amazonian societies, the Piraha
and the Munduruku, suggests that the ability to distinguish
quantities digitally beyond the ﬁrst couple of integers is
poor in these groups, whose languages do not include
numerals above 3 (Gordon 2004; Pica et al. 2004) – a
pattern common in many such societies (Everett 2005).
These same experiments also demonstrate that the cogni-
tive ability to estimate quantity approximately, or an analog
“number sense” (Dehaene 1997), is found to be strikingly
similar irrespective of linguistic variation in counting
systems. This analog system is also present in numerous
nonhuman species (Hauser & Spelke 2004).

R2.3. Accessing non-WEIRD samples
Commentators
Gosling,
Carson,
John,
&
Potter
(Gosling et al.) discuss an important tool that should
allow the behavioral sciences to obtain more diverse
samples by reaching non-WEIRD participants through
the Internet. We agree that this is a potent addition to
the researcher’s toolbox. The advantages of the Internet
are the ease and affordability by which international
samples can be accessed. We suspect that some ﬁelds
are probably more likely to change in the ways we pre-
scribe if the changes do not require researchers to alter
their habitual practices, or leave their home universities
to go out into the world.
While the Internet is undoubtedly a valuable tool that
needs to be fully exploited, there are some limitations to
this approach, as Gosling et al. note. First, though the
Internet is amenable to some kinds of psychological exper-
imentation, it will not facilitate the kind of integrated
research program that synthesizes tools from across the
human sciences, including direct observation, naturalistic
ﬁeld experiments, biomarkers, and qualitative ethnogra-
phy, into longitudinal studies across the life cycle.
Second, the segments of many countries that have Internet
access probably share many attributes with WEIRD
people already (see Rozin) – they will tend to be rich,
educated (at least literate), and often disproportionately
from particular ethnic groups. For example, Internet
users in Africa are far more likely to be cultural outliers
in WEIRD ways relative to the general African population,
compared to, say, Internet users in Europe relative to the
general European population. Third, many people overes-
timate the current reach of the Web. Our Table R1 gives
the percentage of the total population in each of the
world’s major regions that comprises of Internet users
(i.e., percentage of Internet penetration across the
globe). The percentages for Africa, Asia, and Latin
America are not only low, but the distributions are
highly skewed. Most African countries have Internet pen-
etrations of less than 1%; and the overall African pen-
etration is distorted upward by the higher distribution in
Egypt, South Africa, and Nigeria. The aggregate statistics
for Oceania/Australia are also deceptive, as more than half
the countries comprising that region have less than 15%
penetration, with six countries showing less than 5% pen-
etration (Solomon Islands, Kiribati, Papua New Guinea,
Nauru, Marshall Islands, and Samoa). Fourth and ﬁnally,
we hope that the ease of this method does not discourage
researchers from considering other ways to broaden their
research
programs
to integrate
diverse
populations.
Overall, we are in favor of any additional methodological
tools that can be used to study diverse human samples,
and we believe the ﬁeld will be best off by using a wide
variety of different tools.
R3. “Basic level” processes, learning, and
computational operations
Four
commentaries
emphasize
a
bipartite
partition
between (1) mental content and (2) basic or universal,
psychological processes (Rozin), variously labeled as
“learning” (Danks & Rose), “computational operations”
(Khemlani et al.), or “low-level processing” (Rochat).
Each commentary emphasizes that while content varies,
the
underlying
computational
machine
is
constant.
Danks & Rose write, “there is a natural, defensible distinc-
tion between the cognitive ‘objects’ of the mind, and
dynamic mental ‘processes.’ Cognitive objects include rep-
resentations, knowledge structures, and so on.” Similarly,
Rozin notes, “But at the level of basic psychological pro-
cesses, such as learning, motor organization, or vision,
the NAU [North American undergraduate] is probably a
pretty good fruit ﬂy.” Maybe this is how the human
mind operates, like the computer on your desk, but how
do we know until we sample a broad range of human diver-
sity? Human learning or computational processes might
be self-modifying to adapt to local conditions, so, while
all human fetuses might begin with (roughly) the same
cognitive equipment, acquired content could provide
feedback and alter these “basic”-level learning or compu-
tational processes through phenotypic plasticity or cultural
transmission. Or, culture-gene coevolution, which is
increasingly recognized as a powerful force in human evol-
ution (Laland et al. 2010), could genetically adapt local
populations to more effectively acquire and process the
local stable cultural representations.
Our own folk model of human psychology, which is also
rooted in a computer metaphor, conforms to that suggested
by these commentators. However, we think the available
evidence ought to make us question this metaphor. Let’s
ﬁrst consider vision, since Rozin highlights this. By all
appearances, vision seems to be the product of “basic” pro-
cesses. We have already discussed the population-level
variation in the Mu¨ller-Lyer illusion, which, according to
Khemlani et al., is “but one single phenomenon in
visual perception, hardly representative of all visual per-
ceptual processes.” However, as we noted, there is also
substantial variation in the Sander Parallelogram and two
versions of the Horizontal-Vertical illusion.
But forget illusions. Suppose one was studying why
people see so poorly underwater, compared to on land.
Can one make universal generalizations regarding the
human ability to see underwater by exclusively studying
undergraduates? Turns out, no (Gislen et al. 2003). The

Moken are nomadic sea foragers who live in an archipelago
off the coast of Burma. From a young age, Moken subsist by
collecting food from the sea ﬂoor. Comparisons of under-
water visual acuity between Moken and European children
show that Moken children have more than twice the visual
acuity of their European counterparts. The Moken appear
to have acquired the ability to constrict their pupils under-
water, thus improving acuity, rather than widening them in
the dimmer light, as Europeans do. That is, the pupils of
Moken and Europeans do opposite things when they enter
water, one adaptive, the other, not so much. Isn’t pupil
dilation a “basic” part of visual processing?
Rozin also mentions “motor organization” as a basic
process. It is not clear to us precisely what this means,
but Karasik et al.’s commentary reviews evidence
showing how important aspects of motor development
vary across human populations, and suggests how this
might be related to childrearing or parenting practices.
Karasik et al. also discuss how children in some small-
scale societies never crawl – instead, they “butt-scoot” or
“bum-shufﬂe.” A “crawling stage” per se is neither univer-
sal nor necessary for adult bipedalism.
Perhaps a non-psychological example will further
sharpen the problem. Suppose you wanted to study the
nature of human running. Can you build a universal
model of human running that is based on undergraduates,
or other WEIRD people? Interestingly, WEIRD people
would be one of the worst populations to select for such
an investigation. Recent research shows that cushioned
running shoes lead to dramatic modiﬁcations of the
human running proﬁle by causing runners to land princi-
pally on their heels instead of the balls of their feet. This
difference has substantial implications for how we under-
stand the evolved design and engineering of human feet
(Lieberman et al. 2010). If one studies life-long sneaker-
wearers, the engineering of human feet appears ill-suited
for long-distance running. In contrast, studying barefoot
runners, particularly life-long barefoot runners, suggests
a marvelous evolved design for the human foot, possibly
specialized for long-distance running (Bramble & Lieber-
man 2004). Hence, if you study WEIRD runners exclu-
sively, you again get the wrong answer.
The difference between the feet of shod and unshod
people has implications even for the interpretation of
ancient hominid evolution. In 1978–79 a 27.5-meter-long
trail of footprints hardened in volcanic ash dating to 3.5
million years ago was unearthed at Laetoli, Tanzania. Com-
parisons of these ancient prints with those of urban North
Americans suggested that although bipedal, these ancient
hominids were not bipedal in the way Homo sapiens are.
The ancient footprints show a separation between the big
toe and second toe, an anterior “fanning,” and a substantial
arch – all indicating differences compared to the feet of
WEIRD humans. However, when the Laetoli prints were
compared with those of the Machiguenga, who live a
barefoot life of hunting, gathering, and horticulture in
the Peruvian Amazon, the Laetoli footprints could not be
distinguished from these non-WEIRD footprints (Tuttle
et al. 1990; 1991). It turns out that WEIRD people have
ﬂat, narrow feet with underdeveloped big toes, which are
the product of a lifetime of having one’s feet bound in cush-
ioned shoes. One cannot even safely identify universals
about human foot anatomy by exclusively studying
WEIRD people!
The assumption that “basic” processes are invariant also
needs to stand up to evidence that human brains change in
response to experience and cultural routines. Work on
neuroplasticity has shown how training and expertise can
create both functional and structural differences in
brains. But the demands and incentives of developmen-
tally adapting to local social organizations, status hierar-
chies, performance norms, carpentered corners, and
other
culturally
evolved
features
of
developmental
environments persist for longer periods, are probably
more constant, and are arguably more intensive than the
behavioral regimes associated with occupations, such as
those associated with musical training, mathematics, or
taxi driving (Reynolds Losin et al. 2010). Yet, musical
training creates structural alterations in brains, such as
enlarging the anterior corpus callosum and altering the
motor and somatosensory maps. Taxi driving increases
gray matter in the hippocampus, while training as a math-
ematician increases grey matter in the parietal cortex.
Consequently, however one conceives of these hypoth-
esized invariant “basic processes,” such processes would
have to remain constant in the face of the structural and
functional modiﬁcations in brains that inevitably arise
from ontogenetically adapting to culturally constructed
environments
(Reynolds
Losin
et
al.
2010).
As
Panchanathan et al. recognize, rather than demanding
universal psychological processes, it might be fruitful to
think about evolved ontogenetic processes that construct
and calibrate diverse psychological processes to local
environments, at least for some domains.
Recent evidence emerging from collaborations between
cognitive psychologists and anthropologists further chal-
lenges the distinction between process and content that
stands as a virtual axiom in parts of the cognitive sciences.
Cultural differences in what people think about loops back
to impact how people think (Bang et al. 2007). For
example, in folkbiology, differences in what people
believe about plants and animals affect memory organiz-
ation and ecological reasoning about living things.
Finally, a key point that is missed by the prevailing argu-
ments
supporting
a
distinction
between
“universal
process” versus “variable content” is that universality is
not an all-or-nothing phenomenon. In order to draw
meaningful conclusions about what is universal and what
is not, one must also make distinctions between different
levels of universals that are grounded in empirical obser-
vation. For example, the cognitive ability to estimate quan-
tity approximately, discussed earlier, appears to be quite
invariant in that it produces cognitive responses with iden-
tical effect sizes across populations. In contrast, many
processes of central interest to psychology and cognitive
science, such as rule-based categorization, geocentric
spatial reasoning, or some egocentric motivational biases,
are universal in a much weaker sense. They may exist in
the psychological repertoires of all peoples, but their use
and relative dominance over other competing strategies
are contingent on population-level variability in cultural
routines and practices. See Norenzayan and Heine
(2005) for a theoretical framework for identifying levels
of universals.
In sum, it is not clear to us what kinds of psychological
processes are a priori more likely to be universal. More
empirical evidence regarding the degree to which psycho-
logical phenomena vary across populations will be of much

utility in addressing this important question. Perhaps, as
Machery alludes, such evidence will reveal that social
psychological phenomena (whatever those are?) are
especially likely to vary across populations. But at this
point, there is insufﬁcient evidence to support such a
conclusion.2
R4. Are WEIRD populations actually unusual?
While agreeing with our central thesis, Bennis & Medin
worry that the seemingly extreme nature of WEIRD popu-
lations on many dimensions may result from various biases
created by the fact that most researchers are themselves
WEIRD, and that psychological instruments are devel-
oped and honed in WEIRD populations. We are sympath-
etic with their concerns, although we quibble with some of
the details of their critique.
Bennis & Medin begin their critique by proposing that
a consideration of base rates would suggest that something
is amiss with our claim. Their logic implies that it was
essentially a random process that determined which
society, of all historical and extant societies, happened to
accumulate sufﬁcient experimental ﬁndings about human
behavior from enough populations to begin to consider
the question at hand. However, the right way to think
about the question they are posing is to ask: What is the
probability that a society is psychologically unusual,
given that it is the ﬁrst to aggregate sufﬁcient experimental
ﬁndings from diverse societies to even explore the ques-
tion? For starters, such a society has to inherit a scientiﬁc
and experimental tradition. The society has to be economi-
cally successful enough to create occupational specializ-
ations for experts in human psychology and behavior.
The society has to be willing to place sufﬁcient value on
these activities, despite their questionable economic
utility. This society must be willing to fund data collection
in some diverse populations. And, at least some members
of the society have to ﬁnd this endeavor sufﬁciently inter-
esting to dedicate their lives to pursuing it. Given all these
prerequisites, which limit the number of candidate
societies to a handful, we think it is quite plausible that
the society which ﬁrst had sufﬁcient experimental ﬁndings
to explore the question at all, would itself be psychologi-
cally unusual.
In fact, many of the ﬁndings reviewed in our article and
in these commentaries could plausibly be linked to being
in a position to explore the question. Commenators
Kesebir, Oishi, & Spellman (Kesebir et al.) note that
Americans have low pathogen loads and high residential
mobility, both of which are correlated with individualism
and may promote economic growth. Together, Lancy
and Fernald suggest that American (and Western, more
generally) childrearing practices may speed the cognitive
development of particular skills. We pointed out the
unusual lack of co-sleeping in the United States, which
may inﬂuence independence and self-reliance. Individua-
listic notions of the self may increase Americans’ curiosity
about psychology, which might explain why psychology is
so dominated by U.S.-based research. Differences in hol-
istic versus analytical thinking may be linked to epistemic
social norms about what counts as “good thinking”
(Buchtel & Norenzayan 2008), and may be rooted in the
very origins of science (Nisbett 2003). Visual illusion
variability and folkbiological anomalies may be linked to
growing up in built urban environments with ample two-
dimensional
representations
(artwork,
photographs).
Motivations for fairness towards anonymous others are
highly correlated with market participation, whereas
motivations for antisocial punishment strongly negatively
predict GDP; both of these factors can impact economic
performance. In short, it appears that a society that has
conducted and amassed a large majority of the extant
psychological data may, for precisely the same underlying
reasons, be a psychological outlier, at least on many impor-
tant dimensions. These are not independent processes, as
Bennis & Medin would have it.
Having clariﬁed this, we do agree with Bennis &
Medin’s more general concern that WEIRD samples
may look particularly unusual on those measures that
have been selected, developed, and honed for use in
WEIRD populations. If Indian psychologists ﬁrst ident-
iﬁed a speciﬁc phenomenon that was of particular
concern in India, they too might hone their methods to
enhance their effects, resulting in Indian participants
being outliers for that phenomenon. However, this is pre-
cisely the problem that the behavioral sciences face –
initial theories are largely derived from WEIRD samples,
and, as such, we fail to consider phenomena that might
be of greater concern elsewhere. As our target article
emphasized, it remains an open question whether, when
a full accounting is taken of all the psychological phenom-
ena that exist throughout the world, WEIRD samples will
remain any more unusual than other societies. At present,
we lack the empirical data to evaluate this possibility, and
hope that researchers strive to contribute to this database
by identifying and studying phenomena that are more of
a concern in other populations.
R5. Does variability conceal psychological
universals? Is WEIRD WRONG?
Gaertner et al.’s commentary stands as the sole one that
explicitly rejects our basic claim regarding population-
level variability in psychological processes. Although this
commentary is unique in its criticism of our key argu-
ments, we suspect that many behavioral scientists share
the intuitions underlying these commentators’ critique,
and we therefore devote substantial space to this in our
response.
Gaertner et al. maintain that behavioral scientists
study the culturally variant phenotypes of an underlying
universal genotype. We note that this point is dependent
on researchers being able to discern what the underlying
universal psychological process is in the ﬁrst place. But
behavioral scientists do not have direct access to this
underlying genotypic level; rather, we are in the business
of studying questions at the phenotypic level, such as,
whether people view themselves more positively than
they are viewed by others, whether people succumb to
the Mu¨ller-Lyer illusion, or at what point people reject
low offers in the Ultimatum Game. The genotypic level
is inferred on the basis of the phenotypic evidence; and
when the phenotypic evidence comes from a narrow
sample,
such
as
North
American
undergraduates,
researchers very well might incorrectly infer what is
going on at the genotypic level.

As an analogy, consider the case of understanding preg-
nancy sickness. All of the major hypotheses for why
women get nausea and vomiting during their ﬁrst trime-
ster are evolutionary explanations. Some hypothesize
that pregnancy sickness is an evolutionary byproduct of
the body’s need to alter hormonal levels, to permit the
growth of a fetus. Other explanations propose that preg-
nancy sickness is an adaptation triggered by either
threats from pathogens (in meat) or toxins (from plants).
Which evolutionary explanation is correct? It turns out
that key evidence comes from studies of small-scale
societies that rely on very little meat and use corn as a
staple (which does not have the toxins hypothesized to
spark pregnancy sickness as a defense). These societies
have plenty of pregnancy, but no pregnancy sickness,
thus undermining the byproduct hypothesis (Fessler
2002; Flaxman & Sherman 2000). So, assuming evolved
universality does not preclude the need for comparative
evidence to adjudicate among alternative hypotheses.
Now consider the self-serving attributional bias, which
is operationalized as the tendency for people to take per-
sonal credit for their successes but to direct blame exter-
nally
for
their
failures.
An
extensive
meta-analysis
revealed that the effect size for this bias is d ¼ 1.05 for
Americans but d ¼ 20.30 for Japanese (Mezulis et al.
2004): that is, the phenotypes are diametrically opposed.
What is the underlying universal psychological process
here? Just like the blind men trying to identify the ele-
phant, one would reach an entirely different conclusion
if one had Japanese data than if one had American data.
The most complete view of the underlying beast requires
multiple sources of evidence; the more diverse the popu-
lations studied, the better researchers will be able to trian-
gulate on the underlying processes, be those universal
psychological or ontogenetic processes.
The guiding assumption of much of the behavioral
sciences has been that human behavior is the expression
of universal underlying psychological processes. We
submit that it is because of this assumption that the
samples studied are as narrow as Arnett’s (2008) analysis
reveals. Indeed, there is little point to trek into the New
Guinea highlands if highlanders share the same universal
psychological processes as the undergraduates in a
researcher’s home university. In the target article we ques-
tioned whether this assumption is tenable – how does it
stand up to the empirical evidence? For some domains
(e.g., personality structure; sex differences in some mate
preferences) the evidence for universality, at least at the
level of functional universals (see Norenzayan & Heine
2005), seems solid. In other domains (e.g., fairness motiv-
ations, moral principles, spatial perception), the high
degree of variation among populations makes identifying
an underlying universal psychological process more inter-
esting (and more work). But we cannot address whether
this assumption of universality is supported for a given
hypothesized process until there is sufﬁcient comparative
data.
In some domains, it might be the case that there is not a
common, universal psychological process. Many in the
behavioral sciences have yet to take seriously the impli-
cations of epigenetic inheritance and culture-gene coevo-
lution. A rising tide of evidence from epigenetics is
showing how genetic systems modify gene expressions to
adapt
to
local
circumstances
without
altering
the
underlying DNA. This can create lasting heritable vari-
ation in individuals (epigenetic inheritance), and differ-
ences
among
populations,
without
any
underlying
differences in DNA base pair sequences – only differ-
ences in gene expression (Jablonka & Raz 2009). Monozy-
gotic twins diverge in their gene expression as they age
because their epigenetic response systems modify their
gene expressions (Fraga et al. 2005). In addition, potent
forces of culture-gene coevolution could mean that differ-
ent
populations
have
genetically
adapted
to
stable
elements of their cultures, such as in the case of lactose
tolerance (Laland et al. 2010). This does not mean that
there are no basic principles to account for psychology
and behavior; it just means that we must move one step
back to principles from genetics, epigenetics, culture-
gene coevolution, and cultural evolution to explain
human variation.
It seems to us that Gaertner et al. are offering an unfal-
siﬁable hypothesis. They suggest that studying diverse
populations will either yield evidence of similarities
because
of
an
underlying
universal
psychological
process, or it will yield evidence of differences, which
mask the underlying universal psychological process.
They do not offer any means for discerning an underlying
universal process in the face of population-level variability.
Indeed, they do not seem willing to entertain alternative
hypotheses that, for example, propose universal ontogen-
etic processes that give rise to different psychological pro-
cesses under different conditions during development.
This is particularly evident in their discussion of popu-
lation-level variability in self-enhancement motivations.
Gaertner et al. challenge us by claiming that the cross-
cultural evidence regarding self-enhancement points to
much universality. We tackle this claim at length here as
it is central to their rejection of our thesis, and it is an
ongoing controversy.3 First, they argue that this motivation
is universal but expressed differently: Westerners enhance
themselves in domains that are important to them (i.e.,
individualism), while East Asians enhance themselves in
domains that are important to them (i.e., collectivism).
This question has been investigated using a number of
different methods. The results from the “better-than-
average effect” largely support this hypothesis (Brown &
Kobayashi 2002; Sedikides et al. 2003). These are the
only ﬁndings cited by Gaertner et al.
However, the other 11 methods that have addressed
this same question
(viz., the false-uniqueness bias,
actual-ideal self-discrepancies, manipulations of success
and failure, situation sampling, self-peer biases, relative-
likelihood
and
absolute-likelihood
optimism
biases,
open-ended self-descriptions, automatic self-evaluations,
social relations model, and a corrected better-than-
average effect) yield an opposite pattern of results – that
is, East Asians do not self-enhance more in domains that
are especially important to them (whereas Westerners
do: Falk et al. 2009; Hamamura et al. 2007; Ross et al.
2005; Su & Oishi 2010). A meta-analysis including all of
the published studies on this topic ﬁnds no support for
this hypothesis (Heine et al. 2007a; 2007b); the meta-ana-
lyses cited by Gaertner et al. (viz., Sedikides et al. 2005;
2007a) ﬁnd different results because they excluded most
of the studies that yielded contrary ﬁndings. Further,
many research programs have documented that the
better-than-average effect is a compromised measure of

self-enhancement as it includes a number of cognitive
biases that exaggerate estimates of self-enhancement
(Chambers & Windschitl 2004; Hamamura et al. 2007;
Klar & Giladi 1997; Krizan & Suls 2008; Kruger 1999;
Windschitl et al. 2008). That is, the sum total of the avail-
able evidence contradicts Gaertner et al.’s claim that East
Asians are self-enhancing in domains of special impor-
tance to them.
A second argument for the universality of self-enhance-
ment that Gaertner et al. offer is that the population-
level variability is a function of different modesty norms
such that the cultural differences disappear with non-
explicit measures. However, other studies of self-enhance-
ment that employ hidden behavioral measures (which
Gaertner et al. do not cite) ﬁnd equally pronounced differ-
ences as those with explicit measures (Heine et al. 2000;
2001). Along these lines, Gaertner et al. cite evidence
that cultural differences do not appear with the Implicit
Association Test (IAT) measure of self-esteem (Greenwald
& Farnham 2000). This is the only method out of 31 that
did not ﬁnd a population-level difference in the magnitude
of self-enhancement motivations between Westerners
(average d ¼ 0.87) and East Asians (average d ¼ 20.01:
Heine & Hamamura 2007), yet none of the results from
these 30 other methods are discussed by Gaertner et al.
Further, the IAT measure of self-esteem has the least
validity evidence of any of the IAT attitude measures
(Hofmann et al. 2005), and this measure does not correlate
reliably with other implicit measures of self-esteem,
measures of explicit self-esteem, or other external validity
criteria (Bosson et al. 2000; Falk et al. 2009). Hence, at
present it is unclear what the self-esteem IAT measures,
and it is noteworthy that it is the method that stands
alone in not ﬁnding a difference in self-enhancement
motivations between Westerners and East Asians.
Finally, Gaertner et al. argue that self-enhancement
promotes adjustment equally in both Westerners and
East Asians. But the relationship between self-enhance-
ment and adjustment continues to be hotly debated,
even among Western samples, with divergent results
emerging depending on the methods used. In general, evi-
dence for this is best with measures of the better-than-
average effect and self-report measures of adjustment,
where the individual answers items regarding both how
positively people view themselves relative to others and
how positively they view themselves with regards to their
adjustment. The evidence is much weaker, and often con-
tradictory, for studies that utilize objective benchmarks of
self-enhancement (Colvin et al. 1995; Paulhus 1998;
Robins & Beer 2001; but see Taylor et al. 2003).
Further, the only published study that measured self-
enhancement and depression in both East Asian and
Western locations ﬁnds a signiﬁcantly weaker relation
between the two constructs among Japanese than Cana-
dians (Heine & Lehman 1999). It is also worth noting
that, although evidence for self-enhancement is far
weaker among East Asians than Westerners, epidemiolo-
gical studies ﬁnd depression rates in East Asia to be
approximately one-ﬁfth that of North America (Kessler
et al. 1994; Weissman et al. 1996) – a pattern that is difﬁ-
cult to explain if self-enhancement promotes well-being
equally across populations.
In sum, Gaertner et al. claim that East Asians self-
enhance similarly to North Americans, and that this
reveals the universality of self-enhancement motivations.
They are only able to make this claim by ignoring the
vast majority of the relevant data. The assumption of
underlying universal psychological processes is nothing
more than that – an assumption, which needs to be evalu-
ated against alternative hypotheses with empirical evi-
dence from diverse human populations.
R6. Misleading categories and contrasts?
While agreeing with our major point, Astuti & Bloch
suggest that our series of telescoping contrasts, and
especially our contrasts between small-scale and industri-
alized societies and between Western and non-Western
societies, distorts or exaggerates the unusual nature of
WEIRD people. They charge us with the “uncritical
lumping together of a variety of disparate societies” and
with using “under-theorized labels.”4
We agree with their concerns about uncritically lumping
societies, which is why we sought to carefully avoid such
pitfalls. To begin, in our introduction we wrote, “We
emphasize that our presentation of telescoping contrasts
is only a rhetorical approach guided by the nature of the
available data. It should not be taken as capturing any
unidimensional continuum, or suggesting any single theor-
etical explanation for the variation” (target article, sect. 1,
para. 7). The ﬁrst sentence in this quotation was meant
to explain how our particular choices of telescoping con-
trasts were strictly driven by the lumpy and sparse distri-
bution of the available data, not by any theorizing about
the nature of the variation. The second sentence, regard-
ing the unidimensional continuum, was meant to explicitly
avoid any suggestion of what Astuti & Bloch term a
“unilineal path.”
Next, because of our concern about lumping disparate
societies, we displayed the data whenever possible.
Figure 2 in our target article displays the 14 small-scale
societies for the Mu¨ller-Lyer illusion, along with two
industrialized populations. We also included all the
samples of children on that ﬁgure. This allows the reader
to draw his or her own conclusions, and highlights the
degree of variation among small-scale societies. Figures
3A, 3B, and 3C display the means for each of 15 small-
scale societies on three different behavioral measures
related to fairness. Again, this kind of graphical display
was speciﬁcally intended to lay all the cards on the table,
and avoid concealing population-level variation in broad
categories. In the text we wrote,
For Dictator Game offers, Figure 3A shows that the U.S.
sample has the highest mean offer, followed by the Sanquianga
from Colombia, who are renowned for their prosociality (Kraul
2008). The U.S. offers are nearly double that of the Hadza, for-
agers from Tanzania, and the Tsimane, forager-horticultural-
ists from the Bolivian Amazon. . . . [F]or Ultimatum Game
offers, the United States has the second highest mean offer,
behind the Sursurunga from Papua New Guinea. (target
article, sect. 3.2, para. 5)
How is this lumping the small-scale societies together?
Figure 4 from our target articles displays the available
data from nine non-Western and seven Western societies
for both the punishment of free-riding and for antiso-
cial punishment. The reader can see the interesting vari-
ation within both Western and non-Western societies,

and can even apply his or her own categorization schemes.
In Figure 5, we show the percentage difference between
analytic and holistic judgments for six different samples,
which we compiled ourselves from different sources in
order to illustrate the variation as accurately as possible.
Astuti & Bloch express forceful charges against our
efforts, while agreeing with our main point. Given this,
we believe it would have been more constructive to have
explained how they would have presented the data and
made the case more effectively.
R7. Explaining the variation: Why are WEIRD
samples so unusual?
For the purposes of our target article we remained largely
agnostic regarding explanations for the peculiar nature of
WEIRD psychology, although we did point out that this
should not be unexpected, given the rather odd ways of
life of most WEIRD people, especially compared to
those of small-scale societies and the environments of
ancestral humans. Contra Danks & Rose, we did not
mean to suggest that this variation is fundamentally inex-
plicable, or that we should not try to explain it. In fact,
all three of us (Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan) have
been engaged in trying to explain various elements of it
for much of our careers.
Several commentaries, when viewed together, suggest
two proximate explanations for why WEIRD subjects are
often unusual. First, following Majid & Levinson, the
English language apparently occupies an obscure corner
of the design space of possible languages, potentially
giving
theorists
misleading
points
of
departure
or
unusual folk intuitions. Majid & Levinson worry that this
“English-bias” may be impacting theorizing in the cogni-
tive sciences, while Machery and Stich show that it has
impacted philosophical inquiry. By citations, the top four
sources of research in psychology are all from English-
speaking countries (see May 1997): (1) the United
States, (2) the United Kingdom, (3) Canada, and (4) Aus-
tralia (for comparison, the top sources of research in
physics are [1] the United States, [2] Germany, [3]
Japan, and [4] France).
The second explanation combines arguments and evi-
dence offered by Lancy, Fernald, and Karasik et al.,
suggesting at least the proximate end of a theory that
may illuminate a wide range of cognitive difference
between WEIRD populations and others. Lancy lays the
groundwork by highlighting the relative strangeness, in a
broad global and historical context, of modern middle-
and
upper-class
American
beliefs,
values,
cultural
models, and practices vis-a`-vis childrearing. Fernald and
Karasik et al. review evidence that is beginning to docu-
ment how these practices impact cognitive, linguistic,
and motor development, including long-term cognitive
outcomes.
At a more ultimate level, we speculate that in the
context of mobile, meritocratic societies like those of the
United States, Western Europe, and Australia, cultural
evolutionary processes rooted in our evolved tendencies
to imitate successful and prestigious individuals (Henrich
& Gil-White 2001) will favor the spread of child-rearing
traits that speed up and enhance the development of
those particular cognitive and social skills that eventually
translate into social and economic success in these popu-
lations. This kind of cultural evolutionary process may be
part of what is driving the dramatic increases in IQ
observed in many industrialized nations over the last
century (Flynn 2007), along with increases in biases
toward analytical reasoning and individualism. It would
also explain the obsession with active instruction of all
kinds shown by middle- and upper-class Americans
(Lancy 2008).
In our target article we wanted to avoid making any
theoretical claims regarding the origins of the psychologi-
cal differences we highlighted. We suggested that WEIRD
psychology probably arises from a myriad of different
proximate causal sources that, at best, have been aggre-
gated in WEIRD populations. The two hypotheses men-
tioned above illustrate this. It is likely a coincidence that
the ﬁrst population to seriously engage in the systematic
study of psychology and decision-making happened to
speak English. However, it is probably not a coincidence
that the economic system of this population happened to
favor certain child-rearing practices and ways of reasoning.
Overall, we suspect that many of the phenomena for which
WEIRD samples occupy extreme positions do so for quite
distinct causal reasons, including some researcher-created
biases. Once the behavioral sciences accept the existence –
or potential existence – of broad-ranging variation among
populations, we can commence with the more interesting
endeavor of explaining that variation at both proximate
and ultimate levels of inquiry.
R8. Closing words
We have a vision for the future of scientiﬁc efforts to
understand the foundations of human psychology and be-
havior. Research programs need to increasingly emphasize
large-scale, highly interdisciplinary, fully international
research networks that maintain long-term, ongoing,
research projects among diverse populations that collect
data over the full life cycle using an integrated set of meth-
odological tools, including wide-ranging experimental
techniques, quantitative and qualitative ethnography,
surveys, brain imaging, and biomarkers. Questions and
methods are best devised and designed at collaborative
meetings of these international research networks.

cross-cultural variation if we focused on the phenomena dis-
cussed in perceptual and cognitive psychology textbooks?” Our
target article reviews ﬁndings from four visual illusions, induc-
tion, categorization, memory, attention, spatial cognition, pro-
spect theory, decision biases, perceptual biases, IQ, and spatial
abilities. These are all foci in cognitive psychology texts.

4. Astuti & Bloch suggest that “small-scale” is a euphemism
for “primitive.” The discrete label small-scale societies is a
descriptive term, meant to distinguish social groups living in
small, geographically distinct populations (e.g., villages) that
range in size from a handful to a few thousand. Prototypically,
the social organization of these groups is local, and often
kin-based. The division of labor is not extensive, and households
typically produce a substantial fraction of their own food.
Interactions are mostly face-to-face. Of course, all these dimen-
sions are continuous, so this label, like many, is meant to
roughly distinguish one region of an n-dimensional space. The
term is regularly used by anthropologists in the 21st century
(Borgerhoff Mulder et al. 2009; Walker et al. 2006) without
carrying any sense of mental or physical “primitiveness.”
