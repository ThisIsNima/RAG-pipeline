The evolution of marine microbes over billions of years predicts
that the composition of microbial communities should be much
greater than the published estimates of a few thousand distinct
kinds of microbes per liter of seawater. By adopting a massively
parallel tag sequencing strategy, we show that bacterial commu-
nities of deep water masses of the North Atlantic and diffuse ﬂow
hydrothermal vents are one to two orders of magnitude more
complex than previously reported for any microbial environment.
A relatively small number of different populations dominate all
samples, but thousands of low-abundance populations account for
most of the observed phylogenetic diversity. This ‘‘rare biosphere’’
is very ancient and may represent a nearly inexhaustible source of
genomic innovation. Members of the rare biosphere are highly
divergent from each other and, at different times in earth’s history,
may have had a profound impact on shaping planetary processes.

T
he world’s oceans are teeming with microscopic life forms.
Nominal cell counts of 105 cells per ml in surface sea water
(1, 2) predict that the oceans harbor 3.6  1029 microbial cells
with a total cellular carbon content of 3  1017 g (3).
Communities of bacteria, archaea, protists, and unicellular fungi
account for most of the oceanic biomass. These microscopic
factories are responsible for 98% of primary production (3, 4)
and mediate all biogeochemical cycles in the oceans (4). Given
the enormous number of microbes and their vast metabolic
diversity, the accumulation of mutations during the past 3.5
billion years should have led to very high levels of genetic and
phenotypic variation.
Direct interrogation of microbial genomes based on compar-
isons of orthologous gene sequences have shown that, in addition
to enormous phylogenetic diversity, the complexity of microbial
life (the number of different kinds or ‘‘species’’ of microbes) is
at least 100 times greater than estimates based on cultivation-
dependent surveys (5). With each new survey, this window on the
microbial world increases in size. There have been spectacular
discoveries of previously unknown microorganisms, many of
which have major impacts on oceanic processes (6–8). At the
genomic level, comparisons of chromosomal size sequences from
cultivars, marine microbial metagenomic analyses of bacterial
artificial chromosomes (9), and shotgun small-insert libraries
(10) reveal unanticipated levels of metabolic diversity and
extensive horizontal gene transfer. Recurrent discoveries of
novel genetic information suggest that cryptic ‘‘genetic reser-
voirs’’ reshape genomic architecture through lateral gene trans-
fer processes (11). There is evidence of hitherto unrecognized
physiological groups among the planktonic microbes (12, 13).
Two inescapable conclusions emerge from these phylogenetic,
genomic, and metagenomic analyses: (i) microbes account for
the majority of genetic and metabolic variation in the oceans and
(ii) the genetic diversity, community composition, relative abun-
dance, and distribution of microbes in the sea remain under-
sampled and essentially uncharted.
Gene sequences, most commonly those encoding rRNAs,
provide a basis for estimating microbial phylogenetic diversity (5,
7, 14–18) and generating taxonomic inventories of marine
microbial populations (5, 7, 14–18). Evolutionary distances
between orthologous sequences (19) or similarities to database
entries identified through BLAST (20), FASTA (21), or Bayes-
ian classifiers (22) identify operational taxonomic units (OTUs)
that correspond to species or kinds of organisms. A variety of
parametric and nonparametric methods extrapolate information
from observed frequencies of OTUs or species abundance
curves to predict the number of different microbial taxa in a local
sample (23–26). Richness estimates of marine microbial com-
munities through comparisons of rRNAs range from a few
hundred phylotypes per ml in the water column (19) to as many
as 3,000 from marine sediments (27, 28). One of the largest water
column surveys (1,000 PCR amplicons) described the presence
of only 516 unique sequences and estimated occurrence of
1,600 coexisting ribotypes in a coastal bacterioplankton com-
munity (29). Using data from metagenomic surveys of the
Sargasso Sea, nonparametric treatments of rRNA sequences
from marine systems argue that the oceans might contain as
many as 106 different kinds of microbes (26). Yet, all of these
inferences suffer from a paucity of data points (a small number
of homologous sequences used to document the presence of
individual microbes in a sample) relative to the very large
number of organisms (generally 105 to 106 per ml) in oceanic
waters. The detection of organisms that correspond to the most
abundant OTUs requires minimal sampling, whereas the recov-
ery of sequences from minor components (those present only a
few times in a liter of seawater) demands surveys that are many
orders of magnitude larger than those reported in the literature.
Insufficient detail about the relative numbers of individuals
that represent both major and minor populations constrains the
accuracy of both log-normal distribution and nonparametric
estimators of taxonomic richness for microbial communities.
This information is necessary for meaningful comparisons be-
tween community compositions from different environments.
Recognizing the undersampled nature of single-cell organisms in
the sea, the International Census of Marine Microbes has
mounted an effort to increase the efficiency of molecular-based
surveys of microbial taxa in both open ocean waters and the
benthos. As an alternative to analyzing sequences of nearly
full-length PCR amplicons of homologous genes from environ-
mental DNA samples, sequence tags (30) from hypervariable

regions in rRNAs can provide measures of richness and relative
abundance for OTUs in microbial communities. This ‘‘tag
sequencing’’ strategy is analogous to the Bar Code of Life
initiative (31), which relies on evolutionary similarities and
differences between mitochondrial-encoded cytochrome oxi-
dases to distinguish closely related genera and species. Nearly
unique rRNA tag sequences correspond to individual OTUs.
Enumerating the number of different rRNA tags provides a
first-order description of the relative occurrence of specific
microbes in a sample. The highly variable nature of the tag
sequences and paucity of positions do not allow direct inference
of phylogenetic frameworks. However, when tag sequences serve
as a query against a comprehensive reference database of
hypervariable regions within the context of full-length rRNA
sequences of known phylotypes, it is possible to extract infor-
mation about taxonomic identity and previously undocumented
microbial diversity.
Results and Discussion
To develop a global, in-depth description of the diversity of
microbes and their relative abundance in the sea, we exploited
the massively parallel DNA sequencing capacity of 454 Life
Sciences (Branford, CT) technology (32) to economically in-
crease the number of sampled PCR amplicons in environmental
surveys by orders of magnitude. We sequenced 118,000 PCR
amplicons that span the V6 hypervariable region of ribosomal
RNAs from environmental DNA preparations. We examined
bacterial community compositions for six paired samples (sam-
ple pairs collected at the same coordinates but from different
depths) from the meso- and bathypelagic realms at different
locations in the North Atlantic Deep Water loop of the ocean
conveyor belt and two samples of basalt-hosted diffuse hydro-
thermal vent fluids collected from the 1998 eruption zone of
Axial Seamount (latitude, 45°58N; longitude, 130°00W), an
active submarine volcano located on the Juan de Fuca Ridge in
the northeast Pacific Ocean (Table 1). The number of reads per
sample ranged from 6,505 to nearly 23,000 sequences (Table 2).
To minimize effects of random sequencing errors, we used a
systematic trimming procedure to eliminate sequences with
multiple undetermined residues or mismatches to the PCR
primers at the beginning of a read. On average, this stringent
trimming procedure reduced the size of a data set by 24%. This
approach is a conservative one that asserts that sequences with
multiple undetermined residues or incorrect primers will display
higher random error rates.
To assess taxonomic diversity, each trimmed 454 read (tag
sequence) served as a query to identify its closest match in a
reference database (V6RefDB) of 40,000 unique V6 se-
quences extracted from the nearly 120,000 published rRNA
genes for the bacteria domain (22, 33–35). In most cases, the
information content of V6 sequences is sufficient to identify
phylogenetic affinity with full-length sequences in a reference
database. Within the 120,000 published rRNA genes, 99.3% of
V6 sequences that occur two or more times correctly identify the
major bacterial phyla for each query. Random sampling of 5 
106 (of a possible 1.44  1010) pairwise distances for V6 and
full-length sequences shows that the differences between full-
length sequences containing identical V6 hypervariable regions
ranges from 0% to 5% for 90% of the random comparisons.
Table 2 shows that there are a very large number of tags from
each sampling site that we define as separate OTUs according
to their matches to different sequences in the V6RefDB data-
base. Fig. 1 is a rarefaction analysis based on best matches for
each tag to sequences in V6RefDB and their frequency of
recovery. These rarefaction curves describe unprecedented lev-
els of bacterial complexity for marine samples, yet none has
reached the curvilinear or plateau phase. The likelihood that
they represent underestimates of the number of different kinds
of bacteria in each sample is supported by observations of
significant variation among tags with closest matches to the same
sequence in V6RefDB. For example, the analysis of sample
FS396 identified 4,288 tag sequences that most closely matched
the V6 from the epsilon-proteobacterium Wolinella spp., but
multiple alignment of these sequences reveals 45 clusters that are
minimally 10% divergent from each other.
As an alternative to defining OTUs by their best matches
against V6RefDB, we clustered sequence tags into groups of
defined sequence variation that ranged from unique sequences
(no variation) to 10% differences by using DOTUR (19). These
clusters served as OTUs for generating rarefaction curves and
for making calculations with the abundance-based coverage
estimator ACE (24, 25) and the Chao1 (23) estimator of species
diversity. Table 3 shows that the species diversity estimates
obtained with ACE and Chao1 are at least an order of magnitude

Value under trimmed tags are the numbers of reads remaining after the
removal of primers and low-quality data. Values under unique tags are the
numbers of distinct sequences within a set of trimmed tags. OTUs were
calculated by comparing each tag to the V6RefDB database and combining
tags with the nearest identical reference.

greater than published analyses of any microbial community.
The rarefaction curves in Fig. 2 are from the analysis of the
diffuse flow sample FS396. Even when relatively large genetic
distances (5% or 10% difference) define similarity groups, the
rarefaction curves predict that additional sampling will lead to
significantly increased estimates of total diversity.
Our analyses of tag sequence composition both by querying
V6RefDB and by cluster analyses show that bacterial diversity
estimates for the diffuse flow vents of Axial Seamount and the
deep water masses of the North Atlantic are much greater than
any published description of marine microbial diversity. An
elevated rate of random sequencing errors is an unlikely expla-
nation for observations of high diversity in these tag sequencing
studies. The recovery of the predicted sequence of the proximal
PCR primer is better than 99.5% for the 118,000 unprocessed
reads. A second estimate of sequencing error comes from
comparisons of sequences that are similar but not identical to
tags that occur at high frequency as exact matches to each other.
Clusters that contained 10 identical sequence tags were as-
sumed to represent real low-frequency biological variants; clus-
ters with 10 tags were assumed to have occurred from random
sequencing error. For the combined data set of processed tags
from all samples, a perfectly identical tag sequence occurred
6,550 times. It corresponds to the nearly full-length rRNA
sequence from an uncultured marine delta-proteobacterium
(GenBank accession no. AF355040). Comparison of this tag to
sequences that are no more than 10% divergent identified 140
tags with only 162 differences from the high-frequency sequence
over a total of 388,020 positions, indicating an accuracy rate of
99.96%.
The extraordinary estimates of diversity for the tag sequences
more likely reflect the small size of the PCR amplicons (120
bp) and sequencing protocols that do not require construction of
recombinant libraries. Analyses of different size PCR products
by conventional cloning and capillary sequencing strategies
reveal an inverse relationship between the size of the PCR
amplicons and the diversity of recovered sequences (data not
shown). With smaller PCR targets, the polymerases will encoun-
ter fewer higher order structures that might retard procession
along the template. A difference in PCR efficiency of 15% will
lead to an 100-fold difference in the representation of tem-
plates in an amplicon library after 30 cycles. By eliminating this
bias, the relative number of amplicons will more accurately
reflect the proportional abundance of different organisms in a
microbial community.
The relative abundance of different OTUs in the tag sequence
data set varies by more than three orders of magnitude. Infer-
ences of the taxonomic affinity for each tag according to its best
match in V6RefDB reveal a small number of dominant bacterial
populations in samples from the diffuse flow and deep waters of
the North Atlantic. For example, although there is a high
diversity of both indigenous subseafloor and deep-sea microbes
in the diffuse fluids, nearly 50% of the population in FS396
corresponds to divergent epsilon-proteobacteria, a group known
to have a widespread distribution and dominance in most
deep-sea vent habitats (36–38). Within the epsilon-proteobac-
teria, 125 different taxa represent anywhere from 0.1% to as
much as 15% of the phylotypes. Epsilon-proteobacteria were

only recently cultured from hydrothermal vents, and those
isolates characterized are either mesophilic or moderately ther-
mophilic sulfur reducers that grow autotrophically with hydro-
gen under anaerobic conditions and many use the reverse
tricarboxylic acid cycle to fix carbon (36, 39–41). These organ-
isms likely serve as an important member of the microbial
community in both the shallow and deep subseafloor biosphere.
In the deep waters of the North Atlantic, the major populations
(alpha-, gamma-, and delta-proteobacteria) are similar but not
identical, and these major populations in turn are markedly
different from bacterial populations in the diffuse water samples.
Underlying the major populations are broad distributions of
distinct bacterial taxa that represent extraordinary diversity. Fig.
3 plots the percentage difference of ‘‘total tags’’ and ‘‘unique
tags’’ to their best match in V6RefDB. For the collection of total
tags, 25% are identical to a sequence in our V6 reference
database, 40% are no more than 3% different, and 75% are no
more than 10% different from a sequence in the reference
database. On the other hand, analyses of ‘‘unique reads’’ reveal
that 80% are 10% different from a closest match in V6RefDB,
and, as indicated by the distribution of ‘‘all tags,’’ the most
divergent tag sequences represent very low-abundance OTUs.
The range of sequence variation between the low-abundance
OTUs is comparable to their percentage differences with
V6RefDB. Based on their apparent low levels of sequence
similarity, these tags most likely represent microbial lineages that
have been evolving over extended evolutionary time scales. The
detection and enumeration of these low-abundance OTUs re-
quires the sampling of many more PCR amplicons than can be
economically achieved by using conventional cloning and cap-
illary sequencing technology. At the same time, the 454 tag
sequence strategy circumvents potential bias that cloning pro-
cedures might introduce. It is extendable to archaea and protists,
offering the microbial oceanography community an opportunity
to capture data about the numbers and kinds of microbes in all
provinces of the oceans.
Microbial diversity in the oceans (and likely elsewhere) is
much greater than previous estimates that are based on con-
ventional molecular techniques. In traditional molecular studies,
dominant populations have masked the detection of low-
abundance OTUs, their overwhelming genetic diversity, and
their individual distribution patterns in marine environments.
The large number of highly diverse, low-abundance OTUs
constitutes a ‘‘rare biosphere’’ that is largely unexplored. Some
of its members might serve as keystone species within complex
consortia; others might simply be the products of historical
ecological change with the potential to become dominant in
response to shifts in environmental conditions (e.g., when local
or global change favors their growth). Because we know so little
about the global distribution of members of the rare biosphere,
it is not yet possible to know whether they represent specific
biogeographical distributions of bacterial taxa, functional selec-
tion by particular marine environments, or cosmopolitan distri-
bution of all microbial taxa (the ‘‘everything is everywhere’’
hypothesis).
The rare biosphere has temporal and spatial dimensions that
impact our perceptions of known microbial diversity. Low-
abundance populations at a sample site might eventually become
dominant in response to environmental change. On the other
hand, at a single point in time, dominant populations at one site
can correspond to low-abundance populations at a second site.
The large diversity of low-abundance taxa relative to V6RefDB
(Fig. 3) reflects the sparse distribution in nature of microbial
populations that constitute the rare biosphere. For distinct
environmental conditions (the North Atlantic Deep Waters
versus diffuse flows), new dominant populations emerge from
the rare biosphere. Differences in major populations under
dissimilar biogeochemical regimes are hardly unexpected, but
the idea that underrepresented populations define such enor-
mous diversity with potential to take over a particular ecological
niche has profound implications. Several ecological models that
account for frequency-dependent mechanisms predict a survival
advantage for rare species, which are less prone to predation and
direct competition with dominant community members. The
concept of a rare biosphere forces us to rethink the potential
feedback mechanisms between shifts in extremely complex
microbial populations and how the genomes of their constituents
change over evolutionary time scales. The rare biosphere may
serve as a potentially inexhaustible reservoir of genomic inno-
vation, which could explain how microbial communities recover
from environmental catastrophe and why every previously un-
characterized microbial genome offers so much genetic novelty
even when compared with closely related taxa.
By necessity, microbial oceanographers have focused their
efforts on dominant components of microbial communities
that mediate biogeochemical processes. What they have not
tackled are very low-abundance members of microbial popu-
lations. The extreme phylogenetic diversity of the rare bio-
sphere suggests these minor populations have persisted over
geological time scales and that they may episodically reshape
planetary processes.

Study Sites and Sample Collection. The TRANSAT-1 and
TRANSAT-2 cruises (TRANSAT-1, September 2002 to Octo-
ber 2002; TRANSAT-2, May 2003 to June 2003) collected a total
of 344 samples from different depths (80–4,500 m) and locations
(latitude, 63oN to 35oN) in the oceanic conveyor belt following
the western and eastern branches of the North Atlantic Deep
Water from near its source of formation in the Greenland–
Iceland Norwegian Sea to the Azores and Bermuda and deep
water masses of the North Atlantic. Samples were collected by
filtering 1 liter of water onto 0.2-m HCl-rinsed polycarbonate
filters, shock-freezing in liquid nitrogen, and storing at 80°C
until processing in the laboratory.

Axial Seamount on the Juan de Fuca Ridge in the northeast
Pacific Ocean. Using the remotely operated vehicle ROPOS,
fluids were collected in 2003 from Bag City Vent (FS312) and in
2004 from Marker 52 (FS396) at Axial Seamount. A complete
description of the study site and the diffuse vents along the
eruptive fissure can be found in ref. 42. Filtered and unfiltered
fluids were sampled by using the hydrothermal fluid and particle
sampler. Once a stable temperature was reached on the intake
probe, fluids were pumped through a Sterivex-GP filter
(0.22-m pore size; Millipore, Billerica, MA), and the temper-
ature and volume of the fluid collected were monitored through-
out the 10- to 20-min sampling time required to obtain 1 liter
(FS312) or 2 liters (FS396) of fluid. All filters for DNA
extraction were placed in 50-ml sterile Falcon tubes and stored
at 80°C.
DNA Extraction. DNA was extracted according to the method
described in ref. 16 with minor modifications. These modifica-
tions included the addition of phenol to the chloroform:isoamyl
alcohol step (25:24:1), the addition of lysozyme (200 l; 50
mgml) once along with SDS and proteinase K, and resuspension
of the DNA in 95 l of TE buffer (10 mM Tris1 mM EDTA,
pH 8.0). DNA was visualized by using pulse field gel electro-
phoresis and quantified both spectrophotometrically and with
PicoGreen (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA).
PCR Amplicon Library Construction and Sequencing of Environmental
Samples. We used the ARB database program (34) to design
PCR primers that flank the V6 hypervariable region of bacterial
16S rRNAs (Escherichia coli positions 967-1046). The oligonu-
cleotide design included 454 Life Science’s A or B sequencing
adapter (shown in lowercase in the following) fused to the 5 end
of primer A-967F, 5-gcctccctcgcgccatcag-CAACGCGAA-
GAACCTTACC-3, and B-1046R, 5-gccttgccagcccgctcag-
CGACAGCCATGCANCACCT-3. We generated PCR ampli-
con libraries for each environmental DNA sample. The
amplification mix contained 5 units of Pfu Turbo polymerase
(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), 1 Pfu reaction buffer, 200 M
dNTPs (Pierce Nucleic Acid Technologies, Milwaukee, WI), and
a 0.2 M concentration of each primer in a volume of 100 l.
Genomic DNA (3–10 ng) was added to three separate 30-l
amplification mixes. Cycling conditions were an initial denatur-
ation at 94°C for 3 min; 30 cycles of 94°C 30 s, 57°C for 45 s, and
72°C for 1 min; and a final 2-min extension at 72°C. The products
were pooled after cycling and cleaned by using the MinElute
PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The quality of the
product was assessed on a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Palo Alto,
CA) using a DNA1000 LabChip. Only sharp, distinct amplifi-
cation products with a total yield of 200 ng were used for 454
sequencing. The fragments in the amplicon libraries were bound
to beads under conditions that favor one fragment per bead. The
beads were emulsified in a PCR mixture in oil, and PCR
amplification occurred in each droplet, generating 10 million
copies of a unique DNA template. After breaking the emulsion,
the DNA strands were denatured, and beads carrying single-
stranded DNA clones were deposited into wells on a PicoTiter-
Plate (454 Life Sciences) for pyrosequencing on a Genome
Sequencer 20 system (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) at 454 Life
Sciences (Branford, CT). By masking the 454 Life Sciences
PicoTiterPlate (where the pyrosequencing occurs) into 16 zones,
we recovered 118,778 sequence reads that represented forward
and reverse reads of the eight sample sites.
Removal of Low-Quality Sequence Tags. To minimize effects of
random sequencing errors, we eliminated (i) sequences that did
not perfectly match the PCR primer at the beginning of a read,
(ii) sequence reads with 50 bp after the proximal PCR primer
if they terminated before reaching the distal primer, and (iii)
sequences that contained more than one undetermined nucle-
otide (N). We included only the first 100 bp after the proximal
PCR primer, because 454 DNA pyrosequencing quality degrades
beyond this point. The procedure used a combination of
BLASTN (20) (with nondefault parameters q 1 and G 1) and
the EMBOSS program fuzznuc (43) (with nondefault parame-
ter  mismatch  3) to identify complete, mismatched,
and partial distal primers that arise from early sequence ter-
mination. Both the proximal and distal primers were trimmed
from high-quality reads before database searches and similarity
calculations.
Construction of V6RefDB and Assignment of Phylotype OTUs. To
assign phylotypes to the 454 tag sequences, we built a reference
database of 44,011 nonidentical V6 sequences extracted from
119,480 bacterial rRNAs derived from multiple sources (22, 34,
35) and curated unannotated environmental RNA sequences
by using the Ribosomal Database Project II’s (22) classifier
(22). Each unique tag sequence serves as a BLAST query to
the reference database. Because BLAST uses a local alignment
algorithm, we collected the top BLAST hits (to a maximum of
250) and aligned them with the query sequence by using
the program MUSCLE (44) (with parameters diags and
maxiters 2). We have empirically determined that two
iterations are sufficient to identify high-quality alignments for
sequences that are no more than 10% divergent. Phylotype
assignments are made according to the V6 reference se-
quence(s) that display the minimum distance to the query. The
frequency of observed best matches to V6RefDB (OTUs) for
each site was used to calculate rarefaction curves with the
program Analytic Rarefaction 1.3.
Assignment of Similarity-Based OTUs and Species Richness Estimators.
Before distance-based analyses, we used MUSCLE as above to
align all of the tag sequences from a single sample. To calculate
many thousands of pairwise distances (where pairwise distance
equals mismatches, including indels, divided by sequence
length) we developed a program called quickdist, based on
code modified from QuickTree (45). To avoid overestimating
distances between 454 tag sequences from the rapidly diverg-
ing variable regions, we ignore terminal gaps and treat gaps of
any length as a single evolutionary event or mismatch. These
pairwise distances served as input to DOTUR (19) for clus-
tering tags into OTUs, generating rarefaction curves, and
calculating the species richness estimator ACE and Chao1
values by using sampling without replacement, a parameter of
100 for precision of distance, jumbled input order, and 50,000
iterations.
Identification of Closely Related Tag Sequence Clusters for Estimating
Sequencing Error Rates. We identified the set of most frequently
occurring identical tags from FS396 (994 sequences) and from all
samples combined (6,550 sequences) by using the unix shell com-
mands ‘‘sort uniq c sort nr k 1.’’ We identified other tags
that were no more than 15% divergent from the collection of 994
or 6,550 identical tags by using the shell command ‘‘agrep 8’’ and
assembled all divergence tags into clusters with at least 90% identity
by using Sequencher (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI).
