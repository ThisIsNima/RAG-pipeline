Learning from the Behavior of Others:
Conformity, Fads, and Informational Cascades
Abstract
Learning by observing the past decisions of others can help explain some
otherwise puzzling phenomena about human behavior. For example, why do
- people tend to converge on similar behavior? Why is mass behavior prone to
error and fads? We argue that the theory of observational learning, and in
particular of informational cascades, has much to offer economics; business
strategy, political science, and the study of criminal behavior.

In 1995, management gurus Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema secretly
purchased 50,000 copies of their business strategy book The Discipline of Market
Leaders from stores across the nation. The stores they purchased from just happened
to be the ones whose sales are monitored to select books for the New York Times
bestseller list. Despite mediocre reviews, their book made the bestseller list.
Subsequently, the book sold well enough to continue as a bestseller without further
demand intervention by the authors.’ Presumably, being on a bestseller list helps a
book sell more because consumers and reviewers learn from the actions of previous

. buyers.
Reports of the actions or endorsements of one set of economic decision-makers
_ often influence the reactions and purchases of others. The transformation of New

York’s Times Square after long decay was triggered by an investment by Disney, after

| which “wait-and-see investors piled in.” Often there are opportunities to manipulate
the process by which individuals learn from their predecessors. There is a word,
“claque,” for those hired to applaud loudly (or to heckle competitors) at musical and
stage performances. Ancient Roman families hired professional mourners at funerals.
Hennessy Cognac hired actors and models to order their product at fashionable ;
bistros.’ Many of us identify restaurant quality by the fraction of seats occupied;
perhaps not coincidentally, restaurants often close off back-room peak-load seating
capacity until the main and most visible section becomes quite full. Advertisements
report the fractions of doctors or dentists that use certain medications and health
products.

We will argue in this essay that learning by observing the past decisions of
others can help explain some otherwise puzzling phenomena about human behavior.
For example, why do people tend to converge on similar behavior, in what is known as
“herding”? Why is mass behavior prone to error and fads? We will further argue that.
the theory of observational learning has much to offer economics and business
strategy.

* It is difficult to calculate the net returns on Treacy and Wiersema’s investment, because it is likely
that they were able to limit the costs by returning books to the publisher, and because the bestseller
status of the book helped them obtain speaking and consulting income. See Business Week, “Did Dirty
Tricks Create a Bestseller?”, (8/7/95), p. 22.

Social observers have long recognized imitation as important in human society.
Machiavelli (1514) wrote: “Men nearly always follow the tracks made by others and
proceed in their affairs by imitation.” The philosopher Eric Hoffer (1955) asserted:
“When people are free to do as they please, they usually imitate each other. ...A
society which gives unlimited freedom to the individual, more often than not attains a
disconcerting sameness.”

This predisposition to imitate is deeply rooted. Gibson and Hoglund (1992)
describe evidence that animals imitate each other in choices of mate and territories;
for example, female guppies are more likely to choose males to mate with who they
have observed being selected by previous females. The propensity to imitate is
presumably an evolutionary adaptation that has promoted survival over thousands of

. generations by allowing individuals to take advantage of the hard-won information of
others. Within minutes of birth, human infants mimic the observed facial expressions
of adults. As we grow older, we continue to be influenced by the observed actions of
others, from the acquisition of Beanie babies and consumption of Prozac, to wider
lifestyle, work, and recreation choices.

The simplest and most basic cause of convergent behavior is that individuals
face similar decision problems, by which we mean that people have similar
information, face similar action alternatives, and face similar payoffs. As a result, they
make similar choices. If Ford simply makes a better car than Yugo, and consumers
understand this, then they end up buying the same car. Of course, opposing tastes can
lead to opposing actions even if information is similar; vegetarians and meat-lovers
frequent different restaurants.

Herding may arise when payoffs are similar even if initial information is not.
In this case people communicate with each other or observe the actions of others — or
the consequences of these actions. The key issue is how individuals determine which
alternative is better. Hach individual could decide by direct analysis of the
alternatives. However, this can be costly and time-consuming, so a plausible
alternative is to rely on the information of others. Such influence may take the form
of direct communication and discussion with, or observation of others. We will call
influence resulting from rational processing of information gained by observing others
observational learning or social learning. This essay focuses mainly on the case where
individuals learn by observing the actions of others.

There are several other possible causes of conformity which do not require
great similarity in individuals’ decision problems. These include positive payoff

externalities, which lead to conventions such as driving on the right hand side of the

road; preference interactions, as with everyone desiring to wear the more
“fashionable” clothing as determined by what others are wearing; and sanctions upon
deviants, as with a dictator punishing opposition behavior. ;

A Model of Observational Learning

Observable Actions versus Observable Signals

We consider two scenarios. In both, each individual starts with some private
information, obtains some information from predecessors, and then decides on a
particular action. In the observable actions scenario, individuals can observe the
actions but not the signals of their predecessors. We compare this to a benchmark
observable signals scenario in which individuals can observe both the actions and
signals of predecéssors.’

Consider an example in which risk neutral individuals decide in sequence
whether to adopt or reject a possible action. The payoff to adopting, V, is either 1 or
-1 with equal probability; the payoff to rejecting is 0. In the absence of further
information, both alternatives are equally desirable. The order in which
individuals decide is given and known to all. ; .

Each individual’s signal is either High or Low, and High is relatively more
likely when adoption is desirable (V = 1) than when it is undesirable (V = -L).
Specifically, each individual observes High with probability p > 1/2 if V = 1, and
with probability 1-p if V = -1. A calculation using Bayes’ rule shows that after
observing only one High, an individual’s posterior probability that V = 1 is p, and
the probability that V = 1 is only 1-p if he observes Low. Thus, p is the (posterior)
probability that the signal is correct. All private signals are identically distributed
and independent conditional on V. Naturally, an individual’s posterior belief about
V also depends on information derived from predecessors (in ways that differ in the
two scenarios).

In the observable-signals scenario, the information signals enter the pool of
public information one at a time as individuals arrive. Because all past signals are
publicly observed, information keeps accumulating so that individuals, all of whom
have the same payoffs from taking the same action, eventually settle on the correct
* See Welch (1992), Bikhchandani, Hirshleifer, and Welch (1992), and Banerjee (1992).

th

choice and thus behave alike. If others’ signals are observed with some noise, then
information accumulates more slowly but still draws individuals toward the same,
correct action.

Because actions reflect information, it is tempting to infer that if only the
actions of predecessors are observable, the public information set will also gradually
improve until the true value is revealed almost perfectly. However, we now show that
a scenario of observable actions is actually quite different from a scenario of
observable signals. In the observable-actions case, individuals often converge fixedly
on the same wrong action— that is, the choice that yields a lower payoff, ex post.
Furthermore, behavior is idiosyncratic--- the choices of a few early individuals
determine the choices of all successors.

Returning to our example, the first individual, Aaron, adopts if his signal is
High and rejects ifit is Low. All successors can infer Aaron’s signal perfectly from
his decision: if he adopted then he must have observed High and if he rejected he
must have observed Low. Now consider the choice of the second individual, Barbara.
If Aaron adopted, then Barbara should also adopt if her private signal is High; as
-Barbara sees it, there have now been two high signals, the one she inferred from
Aaron’s actions and the one she observed privately. However, if Barbara’s private
signal is Low, then as she sees it, there has been a High signal (inferred from Aaron’s
actions) and her own Low signal, and she is exactly indifferent between adopting and
rejecting. We assume, for expositional simplicity, that as Barbara is indifferent
between the two alternatives, she tosses a coin to decide. (By similar reasoning, if
Aaron rejected, then Barbara should reject if she observes Low, and toss a coin if her
signal is High.)

The third individual, Clarence, faces one of three possible situations: both
predecessors adopted, both rejected or one adopted and the other rejected. In the
first case, where both his predecessors adopted, Clarence also adopts. He knows that
Aaron observed High and that it is more than likely that Barbara observed High too
(although she may have seen Low and flipped a coin). Thus, even if Clarence sees a
Low signal, he adopts, because he believes that there is better than an even chance
that the value to adoption is 1." Consequently, Clarence’s decision to adopt provides
no information to his successors about the desirability of adopting. The fourth
individual, Donna, finds herself in a similar situation as Clarence and adopts |
* Tf Clarence takes into account only Aaron’s High signal and his own Low signal then he believes that
the value to adoption is equally likely to be 1 or -1. But Clarence also knows that Barbara is more likely
to have seen a High signal than a Low signal. This tilts the decision in favor of adoption.

4

----- Page 9 (ocr) -----
regardless of her signal, as will all her successors. Clarence is said to be in an
informational cascade because his optimal action does not depend on his private
information, and the uninformativeness of Clarence’s action means that no further
information accumulates. Everyone after Clarence faces the same decision and also
adopts based only on the observed actions of Aaron and Barbara. We therefore call
this situation an Up cascade. Similarly, in the case where both Aaron and Barbara
had rejected, Clarence and all successors reject even if they all privately observed
High signals. This is a Down cascade.

In the remaining case where Aaron adopted and Barbara rejected (or vice
versa), Clarence knows that Aaron observed High and Barbara observed Low (or vice
versa). Thus, Clarence’s belief based on the actions of the first two individuals is that
the High and Low outcomes are equally likely. He finds himself in a situation similar
to that of Aaron, so Clarence’s decision is based only on his private signal. Then, the
decision problem of Donna, the next in line, is the same as Barbara’s. Aaron’s and
Barbara’s actions have offset and thus carry no information to the fifth individual
(Edgar). And if Clarence and Donna both take the same action — say, adopt — then an
Up cascade starts with Edgar.

An individual’s optimal decision rule may be summarized as follows. Let d be
the difference between the number of predecessors who adopted and the number
who rejected. If d > 1, then adopt regardless of private signal. Ifd = 1, then adopt if
private signal is High and toss a coin if signal is Low. If d = 0, then follow private
signal. The decisions for d = -1 and d < -1 are symmetric. The net preponderance of
adoptions over rejections evolves randomly, and sooner or later, usually quite
quickly, must bump into the upper barrier of +2 and trigger an Up cascade, or the
lower barrier of -2 and trigger a Down cascade. With virtual certainty, all but the
first few individuals end up doing the same thing. .

Order of Information, Noise, and Information Externalities

The fundamental reason the outcome with observable actions is so different
from the observable-signals benchmark is that once a cascade starts, public
information stops accumulating. An early preponderance towards adoption or
rejection causes all subsequent individuals to ignore their private signals, which thus
never join the public pool of knowledge. Nor does the public pool of knowledge have to
be very informative to cause individuals to disregard their private signals. As soon as
the public pool becomes even modestly more informative than the signal of a single
individual, individuals defer to the actions of predecessors and a cascade begins.

5

----- Page 10 (ocr) -----
Furthermore, the type of cascade depends not just on how many High and
Low signals arrive, but the order in which they arrive. For example, if signals arrive
in the order HHLL..., then all individuals adopt, because Clarence begins an Up
cascade. If, instead, the same set of signals arrive in the order LLHH..., all
individuals reject, because Clarence begins a Down cascade. And if the signals
arrive as HLLH..., then with probability one-half Barbara adopts and Clarence
begins an Up cascade. Thus, in the observable-actions scenario, whether individuals
on the whole adopt or reject is path dependent.

To see how likely it is that a cascade occurs, consider the situation in which
private signals are very noisy; specifically, the probability that the signal is correct is

- p=0.51. Then, there is approximately a 75 percent chance that an Up or Down
cascade forms after the first two individuals! To see this, first suppose that
V = 1. An Up cascade occurs either when Aaron and Barbara both receive High (with
probability 0.51 x 0.51 = 0.2601) or when Aaron receives High and Barbara receives
Low, flips a coin, and chooses to adopt (0.51 x 0.49 x 0.5 = 0.12495). A Down cascade
occurs either when Aaron and Barbara both receive Low (with probability 0.49 x 0.49

’ = 0.2401) or when Aaron receives Low, Barbara receives High, but flips a coin and
decides to reject (0.49 x 0.51 x 0.5 = 0.12495). Summing these probabilities, a
cascade occurs with slightly more than 75 percent after the first two players. (A
symmetric calculation applies if V = -1). Remember that if the actions of the first
two players differ, then their information offsets so that the game effectively begins
afresh with the third player; if the actions of the third and fourth players differ, then
the game effectively begins afresh with the fifth player. After eight players the
probability is only 0.004 that such offsetting has occurred four times, leaving a 0.996
probability that individuals are in a cascade.

When V = J, the probability of an Up cascade, based on summing the
probabilities above, is 0.38505 (that is, 0.2601 + 0.12495) while the probability of a
Down cascade is .36505 (that is, 0.2401 + 0.12495). So given that a cascade has
occurred, the chance of it being a correct Up cascade rather than an incorrect Down
cascade is 51.3 percent (0.38505/[0.88505 + 0.36505]). Compare this with a scenario
in which individuals do not observe their predecessors at all. Then each individual
would choose the right action, based only on the private signal, with a probability of
51 percent. In this case, the gain in accuracy from observing the actions of
predecessors is a minimal 0.3 percent. In the observable-signals scenario, publicly
observed information signals of predecessors are virtually conclusive as to the right
action after many individuals. In contrast, when only actions are observed, decisions
are little better than when individuals cannot observe predecessors at all.

----- Page 11 (ocr) -----
More generally, even when individuals have more accurate signals, the
information contained in a cascade is not substantially better than a single
individual's signal. Figure 1 illustrates the point. The horizontal axis shows p, the
probability that the signal is correct. In the long run a cascade will eventually occur,
which will be either correct or incorrect; the vertical axis shows the probabilities that
a correct cascade or that an incorrect cascade eventually occurs. Thus, when p = 0.7,
the probability of an eventual correct cascade 0.753; for p = 0.8 the probability of an
eventual correct cascade is 0.857.

When an individual takes an action that is informative to others, it provides a
positive externality. This desirable information externality is weaker when only past
- actions are observed than when past signals are observed, and once a cascade starts,
the information externality disappears altogether. If an individual were expected to
make the error of following the private signal instead of obeying the cascade, the
actions of that individual would add to the public pool of knowledge, to the benefit of
followers. Such altruistic behavior by a number of individuals would ultimately lead
to almost perfectly accurate decisions in the long run. Instead, individuals, acting in
- their own self-interest, rationally take uninformative imitative actions. Bernardo
and Welch (1997) point out that irrationally overconfident entrepreneurs, who place
heavy weight on their own signals relative to those of others, may be exceptionally
useful citizens. More generally, the theory of informational cascades suggests that
social misfits of various sorts — such as newcomers who have not observed past
history, or prophets with special information sources ~ may disproportionately
benefit society (Hirshleifer and Noah, 1997).
Fragility

Of course, in reality we do not expect a cascade to last forever. Several possible
kinds of shocks could dislodge a cascade: for example, the arrival of better informed
individuals, the release of new public information, and shifts in the underlying value
of adoption versus rejection. Indeed, when participants know that they are ina
cascade, they also know that the cascade is based on little information relative to the
information of private individuals. Thus, a key prediction of the theory is that
behavior in cascades is fragile with respect to small shocks.'

To illustrate fragility, consider a modification of the basic example in which
’ * There are some models enforced by the threat of sanctions upon defectors in which rare shifts occur
when the system crosses a critical value that shifts the outcome from one equilibrium to another
(Kuran 1989). .

each individual usually receives one High or Low signal, or with a small probability,
say 0.001, instead receives two conditionally independent draws of the signal. It is
very likely that each of the first few individuals receives only one draw of the signal,
and that a cascade starts. Suppose that this is an Up cascade. Ultimately, a one-in-a-
thousand individual (Spock) observes two signal draws. If Spock sees two Low signals,
that is sufficient for him to go against the cascade, and make a decision to reject. This
is because Spock knows something about four signals: the first one, which must
certainly have been High; the second, which could have been High (though there is
some chance that the second decision-maker received a Low signal but flipped a coin
and adopted anyway); and Spock’s own two draws, both Low. All of the intervening
actions from the third individual up to Spock’s predecessor were part of the cascade,
and thus their actions revealed no information. Based on the two Low signals,

- choosing to reject is logical for Spock. This dislodges the cascade, as successors
correctly infer that Spock observed two Low signals.

Recall that if p = 0.51 there is a 0.487 chance that the original Up cascade was
incorrect. In this case, the unconditional probability that Spock observes two Low
signals and overturns the Up cascade is a high 0.24984. A new cascade develops soon

‘thereafter. If the next person draws a Low signal, then a Down cascade is started. But
if the next person draws a High signal, then it may take several more draws before a
cascade reasserts itself. This new cascade may again be overturned later by an
individual who receives two signals. : )

So far we have argued that cascades are born quickly and idiosyncratically, and
shatter easily. How robust are these conclusions? When some assumptions in the
example are relaxed, is the aggregation of information still inefficient or delayed?
Informativeness of Past Actions

Often only a summary statistic of the actions of predecessors is observable.

For example, an individual may learn that the prescription medicine Tagamet is
outselling Pepcid, without knowing the order in which individuals purchased. (In
fact, SmithKline Beecham 1985 advertising campaign stated that their product
Tagamet had racked up 237 Million prescriptions versus Pepcid’s 36 million.) The
observability of summary-statistics still leads to idiosyncratic outcomes, fragility,
and cascades. The basic intuition is as before. Information keeps accumulating until
a preponderance of evidence supports one action or the other by just enough to
outweigh one individual’s private signal. At this point a cascade starts and new
information stops accumulating.

8

,

----- Page 14 (ocr) -----
A related situation occurs when individuals have the opportunity to observe
only a few predecessors, such as neighbors, instead of the whole chain. For example,
Rogers (1983) reports that agricultural innovations were influenced heavily by choices
of neighbors. This leads to similar outcomes, as long as enough predecessors can be
observed. (For instance, in the example above, observing only a single predecessor may
not provide enough information to start a cascade, but observing two does.)

If there are more than just two possible action alternatives, informational
cascades can still result. However, as the set of alternatives becomes larger and
richer, cascades tend to take longer to form and aggregate more information. If the
set of action alternatives is continuous (for example, all points on the interval [0,1]),
then even an individual late in the sequence will still adjust his action at least
slightly based on the private signal (Lee, 1993). Consequently, private signals can be
perfectly inferred from actions, information aggregates efficiently, and cascades do
not form. However, if individuals cannot distinguish between nearby actions taken
by their predecessors, cascades do arise. .

, This reasoning suggests that cascades are most important for phenomena that

have an important element of discreteness or finiteness. For example, investment.
projects have a minimum efficient scale, leading to a discrete difference between not
investing and investing. Votes are between a discrete set of alternatives. Consumers
cannot choose a car halfway between a Ford and a Toyota, a potential acquirer bids or
does not bid for a target firm, and an employee is either hired or fired.

Furthermore, when individuals have bounded powers to perceive or recall .
fine gradations, they may tend to divide up actions into discrete choices, even when .

- those actions have a continuous character. Verbal concepts combine separate items

into coarser categories. We remember a color as “red” rather than the exact shade of
red. We think of people as honest or dishonest, distinguish friends from
acquaintances and enemies, and for that matter think of statements as “true” or
“false.” The categorizing inherent in ordinary conversation suggests that cascades
can form even when individuals can credibly communicate with each other verbally,
because much information is transmitted as discrete categories.

Discreteness or finiteness can be viewed as a way of adding noise or
distortion to past signals. The main contribution of the informational cascades
theory is to show that when individuals see past signals only through a crude
discrete filter — e.g., whether an action was adopted or rejected — then learning is
surprisingly imperfect and can quickly become completely blocked. Discreteness is

9

----- Page 15 (ocr) -----
of course not the only way to add noise to the observation of past signals; for
example, there could instead be direct noise in observation of past actions (Vives,
19938; Cao and Hirshleifer, 1997a). Such noise slows down the rate of learning, but if
actions are continuous, learning is not completely blocked. Still, either way,
information aggregation is inefficient, wrong actions are sometimes taken for a long
time, and the path to convergence is idiosyncratic.

In contrast with the requirement of discrete or finite actions, informational
cascades do not require any discreteness in the information signals received by
individuals. However, for cascades to arise, signals must not be conclusive. After all,
if an individual receives a signal realization so informative that it provides virtually
perfect information about the true value, the individual follows it without regard to
-the actions of predecessors. If such signals are always possible, individuals
ultimately converge upon the correct action. However, if virtually conclusive signal
values are rare, actions may be mistaken for a long time.

Differing Information Precision: Fashion Leaders

Up to this point, individuals have been assumed to be identical, except for the
different signal draws they may receive. Of course, individuals actually differ in
many dimensions, including their preferences, payoffs, and the precision of the
information they receive. Allowing for such heterogeneity can either exaggerate or
moderate the cascading behavior.

Consider, for example, several neighbors deciding between a Ford and a Toyota.
One is a car mechanic, and therefore better informed than the others about which
alternative is better. If the mechanic chooses relatively late in the decision queue, he
can break an existing cascade because he may follow his own signals rather than
defer to predecessors. Suppose, however, that the first decision-maker Aaron is the
well-informed mechanic. In this case, Barbara immediately defers to Aaron’s decision,
and a cascade forms instantly — Aaron is a “fashion leader.” Social psychologists report
that people imitate the actions of those who appear to have expertise. This is probably
part of what underlies the success of product endorsements in which athletes are seen
to use a particular brand of athletic shoes or tennis racket.

This drawback of leading off with the best informed has not been lost on
designers of judicial systems. According to the Talmud, judges in the ancient
Hebrew Sanhedrin (high court) voted on cases in inverse order of seniority to reduce
the natural influence of older (and presumably wiser) judges on the choices of junior

10
. ‘ r .

----- Page 16 (ocr) -----
judges. Similarly, in U.S. Navy courts, martial judges vote in inverse order of rank.’
In simultaneous balloting, voters decide without knowing how others have voted.
Thus, the advantage of having committee members cast a simultaneous ballot
instead of a public, sequential ballot is that it leads to more informed decisions.
Differing Preferences and Payoffs: To Each HisOwn

What if different individuals value adoption differently? Suppose that
individuals are classified into two or more types according to their preferences;
equivalently, imagine that the payoffs from adopting differ for each individual. As
an extreme case, consider opposing preferences or payoffs, where individuals prefer
opposite behaviors. For example, a new age vegetarian may want to avoid the
restaurant favored by the football team, and vice versa. If each individual’s type is
observable, then until cascades start, an individual’s action together with the
individual's type conveys information about the signal received by that individual.
As with the case of homogeneous individuals, cascades start when information in
the history of predecessors’ actions outweighs an individual’s private signal. Late
deciding individuals of the same type will eventually choose the same action
regardless of their private information, but different types may cascade on different
actions.

However, if the type of each individual is only privately known, and if —
preferences are downright opposing, then learning may be confounded because
individuals do not know what to infer from the mix of preceding actions they
observe (Smith and Sorenson, 1995). More typically, even when preferences and
payoffs are not completely opposing, uncertainty about the characteristics of
predecessors can slow the rate of learning. For example, a software writer may
commit to the Java platform either because she is optimistic about its prospects
(favorable signal realization), because she is relatively tolerant of risk or enjoys
writing programs using this approach (heterogeneous preferences), because she
thinks her firm’s own profits will be particularly high if Java catches on
(heterogeneous payoffs), or because she has made a mistake (imperfect rationality).
A later individual can’t be sure why she has adopted early. This makes the actions of
early decision-makers more noisy as indicators of their signals. Nevertheless, if
enough writers adopt Java, the evidence implicit in their actions will convince even
doubters with opposing signals. The bottom line is that, although it may take longer
when actions are noisy, as long as individuals’ action sets are not continuous and
" An alternative explanation is that junior judges may think that conforming with their superiors is
good for their careers. These institutions also reduce the incentives for such opportunistic behavior.

unbounded, cascades form when the public information set has become precise
enough to outweigh an individual’s private signal in determining his action.
Changing Tastes or Payoffs

Suppose that instead of a constant underlying value, there is a small
probability that the payoff value may change each time period. Then cascades can
still occur. However, since cascades aggregate very little information, at some later
point in time large changes in behavior may occur without a readily apparent
reason; these shifts in behavior are driven by an expectation that the payoff value
has changed. Such seemingly whimsical shifts in behavior appear faddish.
Furthermore, as Perktold (1996) shows, the information aggregation remains
inefficient.

Timing Choice and the Explosive Onset of Cascades

Sometimes large groups of people adopt new behaviors with startling rapidity.
From teenage mutant Ninja turtles to oat bran fads, from counter-culture movements
to religious revivals, the timing of such sudden changes is usually unpredictable. As
with the example of wait-and-see real estate investors piling into New York’s Times
Square after Disney, giving people the choice of when to act can lead to sudden onset of
cascades wherein many followers simultaneously adopt a new behavior.

Suppose that at each instant all individuals who have not yet chosen an action
may adopt, reject, or delay making a decision.” There is a small cost per unit time of
postponing the decision. Individuals differ slightly in the reliability of their High or
Low signals; that is, when V = J one individual observes High with a greater
probability than another. Higher precision individuals (like the car mechanic
discussed above) have less to gain from waiting to see the actions of informational
inferiors, so they tend to move first. If signal accuracy is not public knowledge, then
subsequent individuals can infer the accuracy of the first individual’s signal from the
delay before action. They disregard their own noisier signals and copy the first
individual’s decision immediately. Thus, all actions are deferred until one individual
triggers an explosion of simultaneous cascading activity. And since the highest
precision individual decides first, this can lead to even more extreme idiosyncrasy in
which all actions are based only on a single individual’s information.

* The following discussion is based on Hendricks and Koveneck (1989), Chamley and Gale (1994),
Caplin and Leahy (1994), Gul and Lundholm (1995), and Zhang (1997).

Costly Information, Alternative Information, and Network Externalities

In the basic example, individuals received private information free of charge. If,
instead, individuals have to pay a fixed cost to obtain private signals, cascades may
form instantly, because Barbara may find it optimal to rely on Aaron rather than incur
the investigation cost. Paradoxically, the ability to learn by observing predecessors can
make the decisions of followers noisier by reducing their incentives to collect (perhaps
more accurate) information themselves (Cao and Hirshleifer, 1997b).

Individuals often learn more than just past actions. It might be supposed that
additional sources of information would tend to improve information aggregation
and, perhaps, prevent cascades. After all, perfect observation of past signals would,
of course, lead to socially (as well as privately) optimal choices. Indeed, there are
circumstances where the ability to observe a random sample of past actions and
outcomes leads to convergence to correct choices (Banerjee and Fudenberg, 1995).
However, even when individuals can observe all past actions and resulting payoff
outcomes, idiosyncratic cascades can still form (Cao and Hirshleifer, 1997b). For
example, a string of early individuals may cascade upon alternative A, and its payoff
may become visible to all, yet alternative B (whose payoff is still hidden) may be
superior. Indeed, the ability to observe past payoffs can sometimes trigger cascades
even more quickly.

We have assumed that individuals care about others’ actions only because
they convey information about the value of adoption. In many realistic settings, in
addition to the informational externality described here, there are direct payoff
interactions in the form of (positive) consumption or production externalities —
sometimes called network externalities. The intuition here is that joining a network
may help both to the joiner and others who have already joined. Uniformity is likely
in the presence of positive network externalities.” However, this uniformity does not
display the fragility of an informational cascade. When there are positive network
externalities and imperfect information about payoffs, observational learning can be
pivotal early in the process in determining which behavior is fixed and reinforces
the path-dependence of the outcome (Choi, 1997).

We have shown that cascades weaken a favorable informational externality.
Therefore outcomes are inefficient relative to the observable-signals scenario. This
inefficiency arises from the discrete or bounded nature of possible actions, which
limits information transmission. In principle trade in information could solve these
inefficiencies, but the transactions costs of buying information from scattered and
unfamiliar predecessors could be quite high; further, there are problems of
credibility, which lead to imperfect markets for information — after all, ‘Actions
speak louder than words.’

Potentially, a third party such as government could help by gathering and
disseminating information. A less centralized approach would be to improve
institutions and technologies by which individuals who face similar choices can
identify each other and communicate their information. This consideration suggests
that the rise of the internet (and intranets within organizations) will reduce the
problems of cascades. However, there is an opposing effect: improved .
communication also help individuals learn about the actions of others. This may
reduce an individual’s incentives to gather information, allow cascades to start
sooner, and to extend to larger subsets of the entire decision-making population.
Indeed, it would be socially most advantageous if one could isolate different groups
of decision makers, and then disclose their actions simultaneously.

Applications

We now discuss some situations in which observational learning plays an important
role.

Laboratory Experiments

Laboratory experiments provide the cleanest tests of social learning theories,
since controls minimize potentially confounding affects. Anderson and Holt (1997)
describe an experimental environment designed to test the basic cascades model.

_ (Anderson and Holt (1996) describe how these experiments can be repeated in a
classroom setting.) Subjects were rewarded for correctly guessing the urn from
which a ball was drawn. All balls were drawn from the same urn (with
replacement). One urn contained two-thirds black balls; the other, two-thirds white
balls.

Each individual in a sequence observed the color of his ball, as well as the
guesses of predecessors. In 94 cases, an individual was confronted with a situation

14

----- Page 20 (ocr) -----
in which it was optimal to follow the guess of his immediate predecessor in
opposition to his own private signal. In other words, the individual was in an
informational cascade. In 79 of these cases individuals acted against their own
signals and followed the cascade.

Business Strategy

The theory of informational cascades theory suggests that firms should
imitate each other in their product decisions. However, conventional industrial
organization theory often implies that firms should differentiate their products to
decrease competition and raise profit margins. Thus, observing uniform behavior in

_ certain settings supports the hypothesis that observational learning is important.

Kennedy (1995) examines decisions by television networks to introduce

different kinds of shows from 1960-89. The logic of product differentiation suggests
that the introduction of a medical drama by ABC, for example, should reduce the
benefit to NBC and CBS from doing so. However, if NBC and CBS believe that ABC

_ has information about changing public tastes for different kinds of shows, they may
want to imitate ABC’s choice. After controlling for other factors, Kennedy finds that
“the networks tend to make introductions in the same categories as their rivals (e.g.,
situation comedies, medical dramas, adventure series).” He concludes that “in at
least one industry, strategic imitation appears to be common” contrary to “the more
traditional differentiation hypothesis.”

A potential problem with studies of imitation is that there can be common
information signals — e.g., about shifts in viewers’ tastes — that are observable to the
TV networks but not to the econometrician. This could lead to commonality of
behavior without imitation. But Kennedy points out: “While of theoretical concern,
conversations with programming analysts at both CBS and NBC indicate that no
reliable common signal exists. Each network performs extensive market research,
but there are no important independent sources of information (other than ratings,
which are observed by the econometrician) and joint market research does not
generally occur.” Moreover, an obstacle to direct communication in this context is that
networks are likely to be skeptical of any information offered to them by their
competitors.

Is there a more general tendency toward strategic imitation? In Gilbert and
Lieberman’s (1987) study of 24 chemical products over two decades, larger firms in
an industry tend to invest when their rivals do not, but smaller firms “tend to follow

15
,

----- Page 21 (ocr) -----
the investment activity of others.” This behavior is consistent with a “fashion leader”
version of the cascades model in which the small free-ride informationally on the
large.

In an example of spatial clustering of bank branches in cities, Chaudhuri,
Chang, and Jayaratne (1997) point out that banks may have imperfect information
about the potential profitability of opening a branch in a particular neighborhood.
They show that a bank’s decision to open a new branch in a census tract of New
York City during 1990-95 depended on the number of existing branches in that
tract. They use tract-level socioeconomic data, land-use data, and crime statistics to
control for expected tract profitability. Still, they report a positive incremental
relation between a bank’s decision to open a new branch and the presence of other

_banks’ branches and conclude that the evidence supports information-based
imitation.

There are instances in which hindsight shows that incorrect cascades
persisted for a time. Wooden plank toll roads originated in Russia and were
introduced in Canada in 1840. In.1844, the promoter George Geddes convinced the

.town of Salina, New York, that plank roads would last about eight years. In 1846,
the Salina road was completed, and 289 New York plank road companies
incorporated in the following four years. Other promoters began to claim durability
of even 10-15 years. Altogether, 10,000 miles of plank roads were constructed. The
revelation of the true life-span of about four to five years came in 1852, when the
Salina road deteriorated dangerously. Plank road construction quickly came to a
halt (Klein and Majewski, 1996).

Consumer Marketing

We described earlier some questionable methods of manipulating social
learning, such as inflating the sales measures used for constructing a bestseller list.
The cascade theory explains why the ubiquitous and legitimate marketing method
of offering a low initial price may be a successful scheme for introducing an
experience good: early adoptions induced by the low price help start a positive
cascade. This idea was first analyzed by Welch (1992) to explain why initial public
offerings of equity are on average severely underpriced by issuing firms. Disney
sells its movie videocassettes with special bonuses (in effect, price cuts) for advance
buyers. Indeed, a seller may be tempted to cut price secretly for early buyers, so that
later buyers will attribute the popularity of the product to high quality rather than
low price. ,

Crime and Enforcement

There is a great deal of evidence that the decision to commit crime is
influenced by observing the behavior of others; for an excellent discussion, see
Kahan (1997). When individuals see peers commit crime, they may infer that others
perceive the probability of gain to be high and of punishment or stigmatization to be
low. If apprehension is rare, a few individuals who are relatively insensitive to
penalties and continue to visibly commit crime may lead to a broader inference in
the community that crime pays.”

Evidence also suggests that the underlying determinants of crime are
idiosyncratic. Sometimes public news of one kind of crime leads to more of that
crime. Sheffrin and Triest (1992) report that news stories about tax non-compliance
spark greater tax evasion by others. Several researchers have provided evidence of
contagion in more spectacular crimes such as assassinations, hijackings,
kidnappings, and serial murders (see Bandura (19738); Berkowitz (1973), Landes
(1978)). Other studies have found that crime is tied to whether others in the
neighborhood are committing crime, even after controlling for demographic
variables (such as race and income) and law enforcement. Glaeser, Sacerdote, and
Scheinkman (1996) provide evidence from New York City neighborhoods that
individuals are more likely, ceteris paribus, to commit crimes when those around
them do, controlling for a variety of variables. Skogan (1990) provide evidence from
40 urban neighborhoods that robbery rates are correlated with measures of social
disorder (like graffiti). In both studies, individuals’ decisions to commit crime and
the presence of gangs were more influenced by others than by demographic
variables such as race and poverty, and by law enforcement. Several studies show
that increased enforcement and penalties for gang crimes have been ineffective.”

The social influence approach suggests alternative methods, such as curfews
and anti-loitering laws that make gangs and criminality less visible. Obvious signs
of crime (such as broken windows) influence perceptions about the likely
consequences of more serious crime. Kahan (1997) argues that crime deterrence
policies need to take such social influence into account and emphasizes the
importance of “order maintenance.” Ironically, conspicuous self-protection measures
by private citizens, such as alarm systems or heavy bars and locks, can convey to
“Moreover, the consequent increase in criminal activity may lead to an actual decrease in the
probability of apprehension given the limited resources available for law enforcement. Hence, the
perception that crime pays becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

* See Miller (1990), Huff (1990); Office of Juvenile Justice (1994).

others that criminality is rampant — and therefore presumably profitable. In 1993,
the New York City Police Department began to enforce more aggressively the rules
on public order offenses, such as vandalism, aggressive panhandling, public
drunkenness, unlicensed vending, public urination and prostitution. Over the next
three years, serious crimes in New York decreased sharply. The effectiveness of this
strategy is puzzling under traditional theories of crime, less so under the social
influence approach.”

Politics

People can learn about the political preferences of others by observing public
protests, demonstrations, and even riots. According to Lohmann (1994), both the
threat of sanctions and informational cascades played a role in the maintenance
and collapse of the East German regime. Secret opinion polls conducted by the
Communist.Party had shown widespread disapproval for years. However, the threat
of arrest by state security police prevented individuals from publicly expressing
their dissatisfaction, ensuring lack of protest. Information revelation eventually
came about almost as an accident. The geography of Leipzig allowed people to
congregate in a public plaza after church services. Weekend by weekend, the turnout
of protesters in the Leipzig ranged from 25 to 2500 per month in the first half of
1989, and exploded to 1.4 and 3.3 million in October and November of that year. At
this point, the East German leader Erich Honecker publicly defended the —
Tienanmen Square actions of the Chinese government, and issued an “order to
shoot.” Large supplies of tear gas and special army troops were unloaded in Leipzig,
and hospitals prepared for a bloodbath. However, Lohmann concludes that
protesters inferred from the participation of others that the potential benefits
(regime collapse) outweighed the costs (risk of a bloodbath). Their inference turned
out to be correct.

People can also learn about others’ political beliefs by observing polls and
others’ votes. This has led to the complaint that early reporting of election results or
polls is undesirable, because early respondents carry disproportionate weight.
Several European countries prohibit publication of poll results close to their election
dates. Iowa voters gave an obscure candidate named Jimmy Carter a conspicuous
early success in the 1976 U.S. presidential campaign. Many Southern states hold
their primaries early in the election cycle on the same date (“Super Tuesday”),

and urges economists to come up with new alternatives.

presumably order to increase their influence on the presidential election.
Medical (Mal)practice

Most doctors cannot stay fully informed about relevant medical research
advances in all areas. The theory of information cascades predicts fads, idiosyncrasy,
and imitation in medical treatments. It has indeed been alleged that a blind
reliance by physicians upon what colleagues have done or are doing commonly leads
to surgical fads and even to treatment-caused illnesses (Robin, 1984; Taylor, 1979).
Bleeding as a treatment, popular until the 19th century, is a familiar example.
Many dubious practices seem to have been adopted initially based on weak
information, such as elective hysterectomy (the routine surgical removal of the
uterus of women past childbearing age), and tonsillectomy. Differences in
tonsillectomy frequencies as well as other procedures in different countries and
regions are extreme (Phelps and Mooney 1998). .
Concluding Remarks

There are many patterns of convergent behavior and fluctuations in the
world that do not make immediate sense in terms of traditional economic models,
such as fixation on wrong technologies, stock market crashes, sharp shifts in
investment and unemployment, bank runs, and reversals in election outcomes. Such
behavioral convergence often appears spontaneously without any obvious
punishment of defectors, sometimes even in the face of negative payoff externalities.

Although other factors (such as network externalities and preference
interactions) can lock in an inefficient behavior, the informational cascades theory
differs in that it implies pervasive but fragile herd behavior. This occurs because
cascades are triggered by a small amount of information. Under informational
cascades, the system spontaneously fluctuates until it reaches a precarious resting
point in which behavior is sensitive to small shocks.”
“In this respect the cascades phenomenon is somewhat like physics models of "self-organized
criticality" (Bak and Chen 1991). There are, however, some important differences. The most obvious
is that the basic elements of the cascades theory are rational, information-processing individuals.
Also, there is a broad parallel between cascades models and models of nonlinear dynamics (chaos
theory) in that small differences in initial conditions/realizations can make a large difference for
later outcomes.

19

Most real applications involve mixtures of informational effects, sanctions
against defectors, network externalities, and preference effects. We believe that the
integration of learning/cascades effects with other factors will lead us to better
theories about the process by which society locks into technologies or customs, and
how information releases can be used to shift undesirable equilibria.
Observational learning theory suggests that in many situations, even if
payoffs are independent and people are rational, decisions tend to converge quickly
but tend to be idiosyncratic and fragile. Convergence arises locally or temporally |
upon a behavior, and can suddenly shift into convergence on the opposite behavior. .
The required assumptions, primarily discreteness or boundedness of possible action
-choices, are mild and likely to be present in many realistic setting. This suggests
that cascade effects may be ubiquitous and have promise for explaining phenomena
that have puzzled economists and other social scientists.
