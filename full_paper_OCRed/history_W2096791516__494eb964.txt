An integrated map of genetic variation
from 1,092 human genomes
The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium*
By characterizing the geographic and functional spectrum of human genetic variation, the 1000 Genomes Project aims to
build a resource to help to understand the genetic contribution to disease. Here we describe the genomes of 1,092
individuals from 14 populations, constructed using a combination of low-coverage whole-genome and exome
sequencing. By developing methods to integrate information across several algorithms and diverse data sources, we
provide a validated haplotype map of 38 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1.4 million short insertions and
deletions, and more than 14,000 larger deletions. We show that individuals from different populations carry different
profiles of rare and common variants, and that low-frequency variants show substantial geographic differentiation,
which is further increased by the action of purifying selection. We show that evolutionary conservation and coding
consequence are key determinants of the strength of purifying selection, that rare-variant load varies substantially
across biological pathways, and that each individual contains hundreds of rare non-coding variants at conserved sites,
such as motif-disrupting changes in transcription-factor-binding sites. This resource, which captures up to 98% of
accessible single nucleotide polymorphisms at a frequency of 1% in related populations, enables analysis of common and
low-frequency variants in individuals from diverse, including admixed, populations.
Recent efforts to map human genetic variation by sequencing exomes1
and whole genomes2–4 have characterized the vast majority of com-
mon single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and many structural
variants across the genome. However, although more than 95% of
common (.5% frequency) variants were discovered in the pilot phase
of the 1000 Genomes Project, lower-frequency variants, particularly
those outside the coding exome, remain poorly characterized. Low-fre-
quency variants are enriched for potentially functional mutations, for
example, protein-changing variants, under weak purifying selection1,5,6.
Furthermore, because low-frequency variants tend to be recent in
origin, they exhibit increased levels of population differentiation6–8.
Characterizing such variants, for both point mutations and struc-
tural changes, across a range of populations is thus likely to identify
many variants of functional importance and is crucial for interpreting
individual genome sequences, to help separate shared variants from
those private to families, for example.
We now report on the genomes of 1,092 individuals sampled from
14 populations drawn from Europe, East Asia, sub-Saharan Africa
and the Americas (Supplementary Figs 1 and 2), analysed through a
combination of low-coverage (2–63) whole-genome sequence data,
targeted deep (50–1003) exome sequence data and dense SNP geno-
type data (Table 1 and Supplementary Tables 1–3). This design was
shown by the pilot phase2 to be powerful and cost-effective in dis-
covering and genotyping all but the rarest SNP and short insertion
and deletion (indel) variants. Here, the approach was augmented with
statistical methods for selecting higher quality variant calls from can-
didates obtained using multiple algorithms, and to integrate SNP,
indel and larger structural variants within a single framework (see

Box 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). Because of the challenges of iden-
tifying large and complex structural variants and shorter indels in
regionsof lowcomplexity, we focused on conservative buthigh-quality
subsets: biallelic indels and large deletions.
Overall, we discovered and genotyped 38 million SNPs, 1.4 million
bi-allelic indels and 14,000 large deletions (Table 1). Several tech-
nologies were used to validate a frequency-matched set of sites to
assess and control the false discovery rate (FDR) for all variant types.
Where results were clear, 3 out of 185 exome sites (1.6%), 5 out of 281
low-coverage sites (1.8%) and 72 out of 3,415 large deletions (2.1%)
could not be validated (Supplementary Information and Supplemen-
tary Tables 4–9). The initial indel call set was found to have a high
FDR (27 out of 76), which led to the application of further filters,
leaving an implied FDR of 5.4% (Supplementary Table 6 and
Supplementary Information). Moreover, for 2.1% of low-coverage
SNP and 18% of indel sites, we found inconsistent or ambiguous
results, indicating that substantial challenges remain in characterizing
variation in low-complexity genomic regions. We previously described
the ‘accessible genome’: the fraction of the reference genome in which
short-read data can lead to reliable variant discovery. Through longer
read lengths, the fraction accessible has increased from 85% in the pilot
phase to 94% (available as a genome annotation; see Supplementary
Information), and 1.7 million low-quality SNPs from the pilot phase
have been eliminated.
By comparison to external SNP and high-depth sequencing data,
we estimate the power to detect SNPs present at a frequency of 1% in
the study samples is 99.3% across the genome and 99.8% in the con-
sensus exome target (Fig. 1a). Moreover, the power to detect SNPs at
0.1% frequency in the study is more than 90% in the exome and nearly
70% across the genome. The accuracy of individual genotype calls at
heterozygous sites is more than 99% for common SNPs and 95% for
SNPs at a frequency of 0.5% (Fig. 1b). By integrating linkage disequi-
librium information,genotypes from low-coveragedataareas accurate
as those from high-depth exome data for SNPs with frequencies .1%.
For very rare SNPs (#0.1%, therefore present in one or two copies),
there is no gain in genotype accuracy from incorporating linkage dis-
equilibrium information and accuracy is lower. Variation among
samples in genotype accuracy is primarily driven by sequencing depth
(Supplementary Fig. 3) and technical issues such as sequencing plat-
form and version (detectable by principal component analysis; Sup-
plementary Fig. 4), rather than by population-level characteristics.
The accuracy of inferred haplotypes at common SNPs was estimated
by comparison to SNP data collected on mother–father–offspring trios
for a subsetofthesamples.Thisindicatesthata phasing (switch)erroris
made, on average, every 300–400 kilobases (kb) (Supplementary Fig.5).
A key goal of the 1000 Genomes Project was to identify more than
95% of SNPs at 1% frequency in a broad set of populations. Our
current resource includes ,50%, 98% and 99.7% of the SNPs with
frequencies of ,0.1%, 1.0% and 5.0%, respectively, in ,2,500 UK-
sampled genomes (the Wellcome Trust-funded UK10K project), thus

Constructing an integrated map of
variation
The 1,092 haplotype-resolved genomes released as phase I by the
1000 Genomes Project are the result of integrating diverse data from
multipletechnologiesgeneratedbyseveralcentresbetween2008and
2010. The Box 1 Figure describes the process leading from primary
data production to integrated haplotypes.
a, Unrelated individuals (see Supplementary Table 10 for exceptions) were
sampled in groups of up to 100 from related populations (Wright’s FST
typically ,1%) within broader geographical or ancestry-based groups2.

24Mb spanning more than 15,000 genes) exome sequence data, and high
density SNP array information. b, Following read-alignment, multiple
algorithms were used to identify candidate variants. For each variant, quality
metrics were obtained, including information about the uniqueness of the
surrounding sequence (for example, mapping quality (map. qual.)), the
quality of evidence supporting the variant (for example, base quality (base.
qual.) and the position of variant bases within reads (read pos.)), and the
distribution of variant calls in the population (for example, inbreeding
coefficient). Machine-learning approaches using this multidimensional
information were trained on sets of high-quality known variants (for

likelihoods were used to summarize the evidence for each genotype at bi-
allelic sites (0, 1 or 2 copies of the variant) in each sample at every site. d, As
the evidence for a single genotype is typically weak in the low-coverage data,
and can be highly variable in the exome data, statistical methods were used to
leverage information from patterns of linkage disequilibrium, allowing
haplotypes (and genotypes) to be inferred.

meeting this goal. However, coverage may be lower for populations
not closely related to those studied. For example, our resource includes
only 23.7%, 76.9% and 99.3% of the SNPs with frequencies of ,0.1%,
1.0% and 5.0%, respectively, in ,2,000 genomes sequenced in a study
of the isolated population of Sardinia (the SardiNIA study).
Genetic variation within and between populations
The integrated data set provides a detailed view of variation across
several populations (illustrated in Fig. 2a). Most common variants
(94% of variants with frequency $5% in Fig. 2a) were known before
the current phase of the project and had their haplotype structure
mapped through earlier projects2,9. By contrast, only 62% of variants
in the range 0.5–5% and 13% of variants with frequencies of #0.5%
had been described previously. For analysis, populations are grouped
by the predominant component of ancestry: Europe (CEU (see Fig. 2a
for definitions of this and other populations), TSI, GBR, FIN and IBS),
Africa (YRI, LWK and ASW), East Asia (CHB, JPT and CHS) and
the Americas (MXL, CLM and PUR). Variants present at 10% and
above across the entire sample are almost all found in all of the
populations studied. By contrast, 17% of low-frequency variants in
the range 0.5–5% were observed in a single ancestry group, and 53% of
rare variants at 0.5% were observed in a single population (Fig. 2b).
Within ancestry groups, common variants are weakly differentiated
(most within-group estimates of Wright’s fixation index (FST) are
,1%; Supplementary Table 11), although below 0.5% frequency
variants are up to twice as likely to be found within the same popu-
lation compared with random samples from the ancestry group
(Supplementary Fig. 6a). The degree of rare-variant differentiation
varies between populations. For example, within Europe, the IBS and
FIN populations carry excesses of rare variants (Supplementary Fig.
6b), which can arise through events such as recent bottlenecks10, ‘clan’
breeding structures11 and admixture with diverged populations12.
Some common variants show strong differentiation between popu-
lations within ancestry-based groups (Supplementary Table 12),
many of which are likely to have been driven by local adaptation either
directly or through hitchhiking. For example, the strongest differenti-
ation betweenAfricanpopulationsiswithinanNRSF(neuron-restrictive
silencer factor) transcription-factor peak (PANC1 cell line)13, upstream
ofST8SIA1(differenceinderivedallelefrequencyLWK2YRIof0.475at
rs7960970), whose product is involved in ganglioside generation14.
Overall, we find a range of 17–343 SNPs (fewest 5 CEU 2 GBR,
most 5 FIN 2 TSI) showing a difference in frequency of at least 0.25
between pairs of populations within an ancestry group.
The derived allele frequency distribution shows substantial diver-
gence between populations below a frequency of 40% (Fig. 2c), such
that individuals from populations with substantial African ancestry
(YRI, LWK and ASW) carry up to three times as many low-frequency
variants (0.5–5% frequency) as those of European or East Asian origin,
reflecting ancestral bottlenecks innon-Africanpopulations15. However,
individuals from all populations show an enrichment of rare variants
(,0.5% frequency), reflecting recent explosive increases in population
size andtheeffects of geographic differentiation6,16. Compared with the
expectations from a model of constant population size, individuals
from all populations show a substantial excess of high-frequency-
derived variants (.80% frequency).
Because rare variants are typically recent, their patterns of sharing
can reveal aspects of population history. Variants present twice across
the entire sample (referred to as f2 variants), typically the most recent
of informative mutations, are found within the same population in
53% of cases (Fig. 3a). However, between-population sharing identifies
recent historical connections. For example, if one of the individuals
carrying an f2 variant is from the Spanish population (IBS) and the
other is not (referred to as IBS2X), the other individual is more likely
to come from the Americas populations (48%, correcting for sample
size) than from elsewhere in Europe (41%). Within the East Asian
populations, CHS and CHB show stronger f2 sharing to each other
(58% and 53% of CHS2X and CHB2X variants, respectively) than
either does to JPT, but JPT is closer to CHB than to CHS (44% versus
35% of JPT2X variants). Within African-ancestry populations, the
ASW are closer to the YRI (42% of ASW2X f2 variants) than the
LWK (28%), in line with historical information17 and genetic evidence
based on common SNPs18. Some sharing patterns are surprising; for
example, 2.5% of the f2 FIN2X variants are shared with YRI or LWK
populations.
Independent evidence about variant age comes from the length of
the shared haplotypes on which they are found. We find, as expected,

a negative correlation between variant frequency and the median
length of shared haplotypes, such that chromosomes carrying variants
at 1% frequency share haplotypes of 100–150 kb (typically 0.08–
0.13 cM; Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 7a), although the distribution
is highly skewed and 2–5% of haplotypes around the rarest SNPs
extend over 1 megabase (Mb) (Supplementary Fig. 7b, c). Haplotype
phasing and genotype calling errors will limit the ability to detect long
shared haplotypes, and the observed lengths are a factor of 2–3 times
shorter than predicted by models that allow for recent explosive
growth6 (Supplementary Fig. 7a). Nevertheless, the haplotype length
for variants shared within and between populations is informative
about relative allele age. Within populations and between populations
in which there is recent shared ancestry (for example, through admix-
ture and within continents), f2 variants typically lie on long shared
haplotypes (median within ancestry group 103 kb; Supplementary
Fig. 8). By contrast, between populations with no recent shared ances-
try, f2 variants are present on very short haplotypes, for example, an
average of 11 kb for FIN 2 YRI f2 variants (median between ancestry
groups excluding admixture is 15 kb), and are therefore likely to reflect
recurrent mutations and chance ancient coalescent events.
To analyse populations with substantial historical admixture, statis-
tical methods were applied to each individual to infer regions of the
genome with different ancestries. Populations and individuals vary
substantially in admixture proportions. For example, the MXL popu-
lation contains the greatest proportion of Native American ancestry
(47%onaveragecomparedwith24%inCLMand13%inPUR),butthe
proportion varies from 3% to 92% between individuals (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 9a). Rates of variant discovery, the ratio of non-synonymous
to synonymous variation and the proportion of variants that are new
vary systematically between regions with different ancestries. Regions
of Native American ancestry show less variation, but a higher fraction
of the variants discovered are novel (3.0% of variants per sample;
Fig. 3c) compared with regions of European ancestry (2.6%). Regions
of African ancestry show the highest rates of novelty (6.2%) and hetero-
zygosity (Supplementary Fig. 9b, c).
The functional spectrum of human variation
The phase I data enable us to compare, for different genomic features
and variant types, the effects of purifying selection on evolutionary
conservation19, the allele frequency distribution and the level of dif-
ferentiation between populations. At the most highly conserved
coding sites, 85% of non-synonymous variants and more than 90%
ofstop-gain and splice-disrupting variantsare below 0.5% infrequency,
compared with 65% of synonymous variants (Fig. 4a). In general, the
rare variant excess tracks the level of evolutionary conservation for
variants of most functional consequence, but varies systematically
between types (for example, for a given level of conservation enhancer
variants have a higher rare variant excess than variants in transcrip-
tion-factor motifs). However, stop-gain variants and, to a lesser extent,
splice-site disrupting changes, show increased rare-variant excess
whatever the conservation of the base in which they occur, as such
mutations can be highly deleterious whatever the level of sequence
conservation. Interestingly, the least conserved splice-disrupting
variants show similar rare-variant loads to synonymous and non-
coding regions, suggesting that these alternative transcripts are under
very weak selective constraint. Sites at which variants are observed are
typically less conserved than average (for example, sites with non-
synonymous variants are, on average, as conserved as third codon
positions; Supplementary Fig. 10).
A simple way of estimating the segregating load arising from rare,
deleterious mutations across a set of genes comes from comparing the

ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous variants in different fre-
quency ranges. The non-synonymous to synonymous ratio among
rare (,0.5%) variants is typically in the range 1–2, and among com-
mon variants in the range 0.5–1.5, suggesting that 25–50% of rare
non-synonymous variants are deleterious. However, the segregating
rare load among gene groups in KEGG pathways20 varies substantially
(Supplementary Fig. 11a and Supplementary Table 13). Certain
groups (for example, those involving extracellular matrix (ECM)–
receptor interactions, DNA replication and the pentose phosphate
pathway) show a substantial excess of rare coding mutations, which
is only weakly correlated with the average degree of evolutionary
conservation. Pathways and processes showing an excess of rare func-
tional variants vary between continents (Supplementary Fig. 11b).
Moreover, the excess of rare non-synonymous variants is typically
higher in populations of European and East Asian ancestry (for
example, the ECM–receptor interaction pathway load is strongest
in European populations). Other groups of genes (such as those asso-
ciated with allograft rejection) have a high non-synonymous to syno-
nymous ratio in common variants, potentially indicating the effects of
positive selection.
Genome-wide data provide important insights into the rates of
functional polymorphism in the non-coding genome. For example,
we consider motifs matching the consensus for the transcriptional
repressor CTCF, which has a well-characterized and highly conserved
binding motif21. Within CTCF-binding peaks experimentally defined
bychromatin-immunoprecipitationsequencing(ChIP-seq),theaverage
levels of conservation within the motif are comparable to third codon
positions, whereas there is no conservation outside peaks (Fig. 4b).
Within peaks, levels of genetic diversity are typically reduced 25–75%,
depending on the position in the motif (Fig. 4b). Unexpectedly, the
reduction in diversity at some degenerate positions, for example, at
position 8 in the motif, is as great as that at non-degenerate positions,
suggesting that motif degeneracy may not have a simple relationship
with functional importance. Variants within peaks show a weak but
consistent excess of rare variation (proportion with frequency ,0.5%
is 61% within peaks compared with 58% outside peaks; Supplementary
Fig. 12), supporting the hypothesis that regulatory sequences contain
substantial amounts of weakly deleterious variation.
Purifying selection can also affect population differentiation if its
strength andefficacy vary among populations. Althoughthe magnitude
of the effect is weak, non-synonymous variants consistently show
greater levels of population differentiation than synonymous variants,
for variants of frequencies of less than 10% (Supplementary Fig. 13).
Uses of 1000 Genomes Project data in medical genetics
Data from the 1000Genomes Project are widely used toscreen variants
discoveredinexome data from individualswith genetic disorders22and
in cancer genome projects23. The enhanced catalogue presented here
improves the power of such screening. Moreover, it provides a ‘null
expectation’ for the number of rare, low-frequency and common
variants with different functional consequences typically found in ran-
domly sampled individuals from different populations.
Estimates of the overall numbers of variants with different sequence
consequences are comparable to previous values1,20–22 (Supplementary
Table 14). However, only a fraction of these are likelyto be functionally
relevant. A more accurate picture of the number of functional variants
is given by the number of variants segregating at conserved posi-
tions (here defined as sites with a genomic evolutionary rate profiling
(GERP)19conservationscoreof.2),orwherethefunction(forexample,
stop-gain variants) is strong and independent of conservation (Table 2).
We find that individuals typically carry more than 2,500 non-
synonymous variants at conserved positions, 20–40 variants identified
as damaging24 at conserved sites and about 150 loss-of-function (LOF)
variants (stop-gains, frameshift indels in coding sequence and disrup-
tions to essential splice sites). However, most of these are common
(.5%) or low-frequency (0.5–5%), such that the numbers of rare
(,0.5%) variants in these categories (which might be considered as
pathological candidates) are much lower; 130–400 non-synonymous
variants per individual, 10–20 LOF variants, 2–5 damaging mutations,
and1–2variantsidentifiedpreviouslyfromcancergenomesequencing25.
By comparison with synonymous variants, we can estimate the excess
of rare variants; those mutations that are sufficiently deleterious that
they will never reach high frequency. We estimate that individuals
carry an excess of 76–190 rare deleterious non-synonymous variants
and up to 20 LOF and disease-associated variants. Interestingly,
the overall excess of low-frequency variants is similar to that of rare
variants (Table 2). Because many variants contributing to disease risk
are likely to be segregating at low frequency, we recommend that
variant frequency be considered when using the resource to identify
pathological candidates.

function13 can potentially improve the power to detect pathological

non-coding variants. We find that individuals typically contain several
thousand variants (and several hundred rare variants) in conserved
(GERP conservation score .2) untranslated regions (UTR), non-
coding RNAs and transcription-factor-binding motifs (Table 2).
Within experimentally defined transcription-factor-binding sites,
individuals carry 700–900 conserved motif losses (for the transcrip-
tion factors analysed, see Supplementary Information), of which
18–69 are rare (,0.5%) and show strong evidence for being selected
against. Motif gains are rarer (,200 per individual at conserved sites),
but they also show evidence for an excess of rare variants compared
with conserved sites with no functional annotation (Table 2). Many of
these changes are likely to have weak, slightly deleterious effects on
gene regulation and function.
A second major use of the 1000 Genomes Project data in medical
genetics is imputing genotypes in existing genome-wide association
studies (GWAS)26. For common variants, the accuracy of using the
phase I data to impute genotypes at sites not on the original GWAS
SNP array is typically 90–95% in non-African and approximately 90%
in African-ancestry genomes (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 14a),
which is comparable to the accuracy achieved with high-quality
benchmark haplotypes (Supplementary Fig. 14b). Imputation accu-
racy is similar for intergenic SNPs, exome SNPs, indels and large
deletions (Supplementary Fig. 14c), despite the different amounts of
information about such variants and accuracy of genotypes. For low-
frequency variants (1–5%), imputed genotypes have between 60% and
90% accuracy in all populations, including those with admixed ancestry
(also comparable to the accuracy from trio-phased haplotypes; Sup-
plementary Fig. 14b).
Imputation has two primary uses: fine-mapping existing asso-
ciation signals and detecting new associations. GWAS have had only
a few examples of successful fine-mapping to single causal variants27,28,
often because of extensive haplotype structure within regions of asso-
ciation29,30. We find that, in Europeans, each previously reported
GWAS signal31 is, on average, in linkage disequilibrium (r2 $ 0.5) with
56 variants: 51.5 SNPs and 4.5 indels. In 19% of cases at least one of
these variants changes the coding sequence of a nearby gene (com-
pared with 12% in control variants matched for frequency, distance to
nearest gene and ascertainment in GWAS arrays) and in 65% of cases
at least one of these is at a site with GERP .2 (68% in matched con-
trols). The size of the associated region is typically ,200kb in length
(Fig. 5b). Our observations suggest that trans-ethnic fine-mapping
experiments are likely to be especially valuable: among the 56 variants
that are in strong linkage disequilibrium with a typical GWAS signal,
approximately 15 show strong disequilibrium across our four con-
tinental groupings (Supplementary Table 15). Our current resource
increases the number of variants in linkage disequilibrium with each
GWAS signal by 25% compared with the pilot phase of the project and
by greater than twofold compared with the HapMap resource.
Discussion
The success of exome sequencing in Mendelian disease genetics32 and
the discovery of rare and low-frequency disease-associated variants
in genes associated with complex diseases27,33,34 strongly support the
hypothesis that, in addition to factors such as epistasis35,36 and gene–
environment interactions37, many other genetic risk factors of sub-
stantial effect size remain to be discovered through studies of rare
variation. The data generated by the 1000 Genomes Project not only
aid the interpretation of all genetic-association studies, but also pro-
vide lessons on how best to design and analyse sequencing-based
studies of disease.
The use and cost-effectiveness of collecting several data types (low-
coverage whole-genome sequence, targeted exome data, SNP geno-
type data) for finding variants and reconstructing haplotypes are
demonstrated here. Exome capture provides private and rare variants
that are missed by low-coverage data (approximately 60% of the
singleton variants in the sample were detected only from exome data
compared with 5% detected only from low-coverage data; Sup-
plementary Fig. 15). However, whole-genome data enable characteri-
zation of functional non-coding variation and accurate haplotype
estimation, which are essential for the analysis of cis-effects around
genes, such as those arising from variation in upstream regulatory
regions38. There are also benefits from integrating SNP array data, for
example, to improve genotype estimation39 and to aid haplotype
estimation where array data have been collected on additional family
members. In principle, any sources of genotype information (for
example, from array CGH) could be integrated using the statistical
methods developed here.
Major methodological advances in phase I, including improved
methods for detecting and genotyping variants40, statistical and
machine-learning methods for evaluating the quality of candidate
variant calls, modelling of genotype likelihoods and performing statis-
tical haplotype integration41, have generated a high-quality resource.
However, regions of low sequence complexity, satellite regions, large
repeats and many large-scale structural variants, including copy-
number polymorphisms, segmental duplications and inversions
(which constitute most of the ‘inaccessible genome’), continue to
present a major challenge for short-read technologies. Some issues
are likely to be improved by methodological developments such as
better modelling of read-level errors, integrating de novo assembly42,43
and combining multiple sources of information to aid genotyping of
structurally diverse regions40,44. Importantly, even subtle differences
in data type, data processing or algorithms may lead to systematic
differences in false-positive and false-negative error modes between
samples. Such differences complicate efforts to compare genotypes
between sequencing studies. Moreover, analyses that naively combine
variantcallsandgenotypesacrossheterogeneousdatasetsarevulnerable
to artefact. Analyses across multiple data sets must therefore either
process them in standard ways or use meta-analysis approaches that
combine association statistics (but not raw data) across studies.
Finally, the analysis of low-frequency variation demonstrates both
the pervasive effects of purifying selection at functionally relevant
sites in the genome and how this can interact with population history
to lead to substantial local differentiation, even when standard metrics
of structure such as FST are very small. The effect arises primarily

because rare variants tend to be recent and thus geographically
restricted6–8. The implication is that the interpretation of rare va-
riants in individuals with a particular disease should be within the
context of the local (either geographic or ancestry-based) genetic back-
ground. Moreover, it argues for the value of continuing to sequence
individuals from diverse populations to characterize the spectrum of
human genetic variation and support disease studies across diverse
groups. A further 1,500 individuals from 12 new populations, including
at least 15 high-depth trios, will form the final phase of this project.
