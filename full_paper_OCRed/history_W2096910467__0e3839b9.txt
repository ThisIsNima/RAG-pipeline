Abstract
The moral domain is broader than the empathy and justice concerns assessed by existing measures
of moral competence, and it is not just a subset of the values assessed by value inventories. To fill
the need for reliable and theoretically-grounded measurement of the full range of moral concerns,
we developed the Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ) based on a theoretical model of five
universally available (but variably developed) sets of moral intuitions: Harm/care, Fairness/
reciprocity, Ingroup/loyalty, Authority/respect, and Purity/sanctity. We present evidence for the
internal and external validity of the scale and the model, and in doing so present new findings
about morality: 1. Comparative model fitting of confirmatory factor analyses provides empirical
justification for a five-factor structure of moral concerns. 2. Convergent/discriminant validity
evidence suggests that moral concerns predict personality features and social group attitudes not
previously considered morally relevant. 3. We establish pragmatic validity of the measure in
providing new knowledge and research opportunities concerning demographic and cultural
differences in moral intuitions. These analyses provide evidence for the usefulness of Moral
Foundations Theory in simultaneously increasing the scope and sharpening the resolution of
psychological views of morality.

How can we measure moral concerns when people disagree about what “morality” means?
To address this problem we created the Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ, presented
in the appendix), a measure of the degree to which individuals endorse each of five intuitive
systems posited by Moral Foundations Theory: Harm/care, Fairness/reciprocity, Ingroup/
loyalty, Authority/respect, and Purity/sanctity (Haidt & Graham, 2007; Shweder, Much,
Mahapatra & Park, 1997). People vary in the extent to which they endorse, value, and use
these five foundations, providing an opportunity to better understand moral diversity. In this
article, we explain the need for a scale broader than conventional morality scales. We
describe the development of the scale, which involved multiple rounds of item analysis
using large heterogeneous samples. We present the validation of the scale, organized into
evidence confirming internal and external validity. Finally, we describe its pragmatic
validity – that is, the practical usefulness of both the theory and the measure in providing
new insights about moral psychology. A major goal of Moral Foundations Theory is to
expand the range of phenomena studied in moral psychology so that it matches the full range
of moral concerns, including those found in non-Western cultures, in religious practices, and
among political conservatives. Here we present what we have learned about the content and
structure of the moral domain using the Moral Foundations Questionnaire.
What is the Moral Domain?
A great variety of scales are used in moral psychology to measure stages of moral reasoning
(e.g., the Defining Issues Test-2; Rest et al., 1999), moral identity (e.g., the Moral Identity
Scale; Aquino & Reed, 2002), empathy (e.g., the Interpersonal Reactivity Index; Davis,
1983), and moral deficits such as psychopathy (e.g., Levenson’s Self-report Psychopathy
Scale; Levenson et al., 1995). Although these scales measure different aspects of morality,
they all share the assumption (explicit or implicit) that the moral domain is limited to
concerns about individuals harming or unfairly treating other individuals. This is, in part, a
reflection of the dominance of Lawrence Kohlberg’s (1969, 1971) ideas about morality as
justice, and his subsequent debate with Carol Gilligan (1982) about her alternative
conception of morality as care. Both sides agreed that morality was about how well or
poorly individuals treated other individuals. Turiel (1983, p.3) codified this approach into a
widely-cited definition of the moral domain as “prescriptive judgments of justice, rights, and
welfare pertaining to how people ought to relate to each other.” Any values that were not
related to “justice, rights, and welfare” (e.g., patriotism, authority, or chastity) were
considered non-moral, and were relegated to the domain of social convention or the domain
of personal choice (Turiel, Hildebrandt, & Wainryb, 1991). Definitions of morality in
philosophy also frequently stress rules or codes of conduct that reduce harm to others (e.g.,
Gert, 2005; Singer, 1979).
Kohlberg certainly noticed that people sometimes justified moral judgments by referring to
group-level moral concerns such as authority, loyalty, and tradition, but he thought that such
thinking was immature and conventional, a part of the “law and order” ethos of stage 4.
With sufficient opportunities for role-taking, adolescents were said to move beyond stage 4
and to begin using post-conventional reasoning based on an understanding of justice.
Kohlberg’s stage theory has been criticized on many grounds; one criticism relevant for our
purposes was that Kohlberg’s post-conventional morality enshrined politically liberal ideals
as developmental endpoints (Hogan, Johnson, & Emler, 1978; Shweder, 1982; Sullivan,
1977; for related critiques see Puka, 1994). This critique was backed up by the
demonstration that liberals routinely obtain higher principled reasoning scores on the
Defining Issues Test, but that conservative students rose to liberal levels when told to
“respond as a left-winger would” (Emler, Renwick, & Malone, 1983). Conservatives could
reason at the “higher stage,” but were not doing so presumably because they had different
priorities in their moral reasoning. Despite these critiques, the notion that “true” moral

concerns involve considerations of harm or justice exclusively has persisted in psychological
research.
Moral psychology is currently experiencing a renaissance as social psychologists,
neuroscientists and behavioral economists begin to treat moral judgment and decision-
making as a central topic of inquiry (see Haidt, 2008, for a review). Yet even today, research
is still largely limited to issues of harm and fairness (including rights). Major literatures
include decision-making about runaway trolleys, in which participants must make tradeoffs
between harm and rights (Greene et al., 2009; Hauser, Young, & Cushman, 2008); economic
games, which pit fairness against self-interest (Fehr & Gachter, 2002); and the perennially
popular topic of altruism and prosocial behavior (e.g., Moll, Krueger, Zahn, Pardini,
Oliveira-Souza, & Grafman, 2006). Whether carried out in a scanner, on a website, or in a
business school lab room using real money, morality is still usually operationalized as
helping (vs. harming) or as playing fair (vs cheating).
Kohlberg and Turiel based their circumscription of the moral domain on a line of
enlightenment thinking running from Immanuel Kant to John Stuart Mill to John Rawls in
which the autonomy and/or welfare of the individual are the starting point for ethical
inquiry. Yet even Kant (1797/1996, p. 179) had intuitions of a broader moral domain. He
wrote that masturbation was “in the highest degree opposed to morality,” although he
granted that “it is not so easy to produce a rational demonstration” of its wrongness. And
before the Enlightenment, philosophers routinely considered a much broader moral domain.
Much of ancient moral philosophy, from Greece to India to Japan, was virtue-based. These
societies valued benevolence and fairness, but they also emphasized group-level concerns
about social order, authority, duty, loyalty to one’s family or group, and controlling one’s
carnal desires to cultivate one’s soul or gain a more favorable rebirth (Larue, 1991; Shweder
et al., 1997). Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics (350 BCE/1985) dealt with a wide range of
questions related to human flourishing and ideal ways of living in a community; it treated
virtues as habits developed by repeated use. Similarly, the history of theories and
interventions in moral education includes not only instructions in care and justice, but
training in how to be a good group member (Graham, Haidt, & Rimm-Kaufmann, 2008).
Western inquiry into ethics must therefore be seen as having made a sharp turn away from
the full spectrum of moral concerns addressed by thinkers of the past and valued in folk
moralities around the world (See Appiah, 2008, ch. 1, on the causes of this turn). Pincoffs
(1986) documented the gradual narrowing of philosophical inquiry in the West since the 19th
century as philosophers moved away from virtue ethics and adopted what Pincoffs called
“quandary ethics” – the study of how people should resolve quandaries, particularly those
that pit the rights or welfare of one person against those of another. Should psychologists
follow philosophers in this turn to quandary ethics? Or should we keep our eyes focused on
what is, rather than on the Enlightenment conception of what ought to be?
Broadening the Moral Domain
Cross-cultural research on moral judgment has revealed that Turiel’s definition of the moral
domain works well among educated and politically liberal Westerners, for whom harmless
offenses are rarely condemned, even when they are disgusting or disrespectful (Haidt,
Koller, & Dias, 1993).1 However, research on people in India (Shweder, Mahapatra, &
Miller, 1987), people of lower social class in Brazil and the United States (Haidt, Koller, &
1Turiel and his students demonstrated their “domain distinction” cross culturally (e.g., Hollos, Leis, & Turiel, 1986), but their moral
violations invariably involved direct physical or emotional harm, not harmless violations implicating issues of loyalty, respect, or
purity.

Dias, 1993), and conservatives in the United States (Graham, Haidt, & Nosek, 2009; Haidt
& Hersh, 2001; Jensen, 1998) has revealed moral considerations beyond the individual-
based concerns of harm and fairness, involving concerns about spiritual purity and
degradation (even for acts that involve no harm), concerns about proper hierarchical role
fulfillment, and moral expectations of loyalty to the local or national group. Illustrative of
this breadth are open-ended responses participants in our studies gave when asked to define
morality in their own words. Parallel to Turiel’s definition, many made reference to harm
and human welfare (e.g., “Avoiding harm to others”), and fairness or justice (“Morality is
doing the right things to ensure fair treatment for all”). However, others made reference to
moral issues beyond justice, rights, and welfare, and to morally valuable entities that were
not individuals (e.g., “Morality is having a system [that] protects the social institutions of
family, community, and country.”). Others made reference to duty, obedience, respect, and
preserving tradition (e.g., “Matters of duty, irrespective of one’s own personal desires or
ends”). And some made reference to God or religious norms, decency, the soul, and
maintaining purity of mind (e.g., “not having dirty thoughts”). Scales that attempt to
measure morality by assessing attitudes about harm and fairness are thus leaving out much
of what people—even Westerners—explicitly and spontaneously include in their
descriptions of the moral domain.
If morality really does vary by culture, class, politics, and era, then psychologists need a
definition of the moral domain that is not based on a list of specific content areas (e.g.,
justice, rights, and welfare). To meet this need, Haidt and Kesebir (2010, p. 800) proposed
an alternative approach that defines moral systems by their function:
Moral systems are interlocking sets of values, virtues, norms, practices, identities,
institutions, technologies, and evolved psychological mechanisms that work
together to suppress or regulate selfishness and make social life possible
This functionalist approach has at least two advantages over content-based approaches. First,
in its emphasis on moral systems it encourages psychologists to look outward, beyond
individual minds and psychological mechanisms. Moralities emerge as large numbers of
people interact with each other, constrained and enabled by culturally and historically
specific sets of institutions and technologies. A second advantage is that this definition
makes it possible to recognize a wide variety of societies as constituting moral systems, at
least descriptively, even if those societies are structured in ways that many researchers
believe to be normatively immoral (e.g., patriarchies and theocracies).
Values and morals
Virtue ethics, character education, and the ethical codes of most cultures and religious
traditions suggest that the moral domain is broader than the issues of harm and fairness
currently represented in moral psychology scales. One possible existing framework for
broadening the moral domain is research on values, which Schwartz (2007, p. 712) defines
as “trans-situational goals that vary in importance and serve as guiding principles in the life
of a person or a group” (see also Rohan, 2000 and Feldman, 2003 for reviews). Most efforts
to identify the range of values begin with long lists of possible values, covering everything
from cleanliness to hedonism, and then use factor analysis of endorsement ratings to identify
a smaller set of core values (Rokeach, 1973; Schwartz, 1992). Values research has much to
offer the empirical study of morality, and is too often ignored by moral psychologists.
Clearly, many values are moral values, even if morality is defined only in terms of welfare
and fairness concerns (e.g., benevolence and universalism). However, in seeking to identify
a list of the most important values, there is a risk that some common moral concerns or
intuitions will be missed. For example, reciprocity, loyalty to one’s team or tribe, and
concerns about bodily and spiritual purity are ubiquitous in anthropological accounts of
Graham et al.

morality, yet they do not appear among Schwartz’s ten values. This may be because
Schwartz began with an atheoretical exploratory factor-analytic approach, using Western
populations. Even if Westerners care quite a bit about reciprocity (see Cialdini, 2001, ch. 2),
they might not list it when asked about their most important trans-situational goals.
Individuals are often unable to access the causes of their moral judgments (Haidt & Kesebir,
2010; Wilson, 2002). Furthermore, atheoretical descriptive approaches are limited in their
ability to explain why people hold the values they do.
Moral Foundations Theory
In order to fill the need for a systematic theory of morality, explaining its origins,
development, and cultural variations, we created Moral Foundations Theory (MFT). Haidt
and Joseph (2004) began by surveying the literatures in evolutionary psychology and
anthropology, looking for matches – for virtues and areas of moral regulation that were
common (though not necessarily universal) across cultures, and that had some clear
counterpart in evolutionary thinking. For example, virtues related to fairness and practices of
reciprocal gift exchange (e.g., Mauss, 1924/1990) bore an obvious similarity to the
evolutionary literature on reciprocal altruism (Trivers, 1971); virtues of purity and practices
regulating food and sex (e.g., Douglas, 1966) bore an obvious relationship to the
evolutionary literature on disgust (Rozin, Haidt, & McCauley, 2000). The results of this
cross-disciplinary review produced five top candidates for being the psychological
“foundations” upon which cultures construct their moralities. These five foundations are
consistent with, but expand upon, several existing taxonomies of moral concern, including
Fiske’s (1992) four models of social relationships, Shweder et al.’s (1997) account of the
“three ethics” of autonomy, community, and divinity that are found widely around the
world, and Hogan et al.’s (1978) evolution-based socioanalytic theory of moral
development. MFT can therefore be seen as an attempt to specify the “evolved
psychological mechanisms” that were part of the definition of moral systems given earlier.
Even if all moral systems are social constructions, they are constructed by people whose
minds are not at all like blank slates (Marcus, 2004). In this way, MFT allows for intuitive
or emotional bases of moral judgments, as well as more deliberate reasoning processes (cf.
Greene et al., 2001; Haidt, 2001).
Haidt and Graham (2007) expanded the theory and modified the names of the foundations to
become: Harm/care, Fairness/reciprocity, Ingroup/loyalty, Authority/respect, and Purity/
sanctity. Harm and Fairness generally correspond to Shweder at al.’s (1997) ethics of
autonomy; Ingroup and Authority to the ethics of community; and Purity to the ethics of
divinity. Haidt and Graham also applied the theory to a particular kind of cultural variation
within the United States: the “culture war” between political liberals and conservatives.
Drawing on Shweder and several political theorists (e.g., Burke, 1790/2003; Mill,
1859/2003; Lakoff, 1996; Muller, 1997; Sowell, 2002), liberalism was hypothesized to
indicate a morality in which the individual is the locus of moral value. In such a moral
world, moral regulation revolves around protecting individuals from harm or unfair
treatment by other individuals, or by the social system. In contrast, conservatives—at least,
the social conservatives of the religious right—try to create more tightly-ordered
communities in which (for example) proper relationships between parent and child, man and
woman, and human and God are part of the aim of moral regulation. In such a moral world,
the individual is not the primary locus of moral value; the building block of society is
thought to be the family, and a much greater emphasis is placed on virtues and institutions
that bind people into roles, duties, and mutual obligations.
This analysis led to the hypothesis that liberal morality would prioritize Harm and Fairness
over the other three foundations (because the “individualizing foundations” of Harm and
Graham et al.

Fairness are all that are needed to support the individual-focused contractual approaches to
society often used in enlightenment ethics), whereas conservative morality would also
incorporate Ingroup, Authority, and Purity to a substantial degree (because these “binding
foundations” are about binding people together into larger groups and institutions).
The first draft of the Moral Foundations Questionnaire was created in part to test this
hypothesis about ideological differences, and was useful (along with other methods, such as
content coding of religious sermons) in supporting the hypothesis (Graham, et al., 2009).
However, our goal in subsequent theory and measure development – reported in this paper –
was much broader. Moral Foundations Theory provides a conceptual organization for
measuring and describing differences in moral concerns across individuals, social groups,
and cultures. In theory, any pattern of “settings” or endorsement levels for the five
foundations is possible. Thus, a reliable and valid scale was needed to measure the degree to
which any individual’s moral beliefs and concerns rely upon each of the five hypothesized
foundations. Further, theory-driven scale validation is a means of testing hypotheses and
theoretical claims (cf. Hogan & Nicholson, 1998). We describe the development of the MFQ
below, along with what it revealed about the structure and variation of the moral domain.
Development of the MFQ
Because we wanted to gauge individual differences in the range of concerns that people
consider morally relevant, the first version of the MFQ (reported in Graham et al., 2009,
Study 1, Appendix A) explicitly asked participants to evaluate the moral relevance of
several foundation-related concerns (e.g., “Whether or not some people were treated
differently from others,” for Fairness). For the second version (reported in Graham et al.,
2009, Study 2, Appendices A and B) we added a new section that assessed levels of
agreement with more specific and contextualized moral judgment statements (see below).
These first two versions of the MFQ were tested on heterogeneous populations (using
ProjectImplicit.org, a popular web-based virtual laboratory), with large sample sizes (total
n=3,825). With these data, we compared different confirmatory factor analysis models that
corresponded to distinct, theory-guided conceptualizations of the possible factor structure
(see supplementary materials at MoralFoundations.org). Using the comparative model fitting
techniques described below, we found evidence that a five-factor solution was an
improvement (weighing both fit and parsimony) over models representing a single morality
factor, two factors (an “individualizing” factor underlying Harm and Fairness items, and a
“binding” factor underlying all other items), and three factors (corresponding to Shweder’s
three ethics of autonomy, community, and divinity).
While the overall model fits were reasonably good (see supplements), some of the internal
consistencies of these early versions of the scale were low. In addition, some items had weak
loadings on the latent factors. Correlation matrices of all items in the second version
revealed that some items that were written to represent one foundation actually related more
strongly to another foundation, and some items correlated so highly with each other that they
appeared redundant. Problematic items were replaced with new items in the third version of
the scale.
Pilot testing for the third version of the MFQ was extensive, involving data from over
28,000 participants (surveyed at YourMorals.org) and external validations with eight
conceptually related scales. Item and factor analyses on this third version showed
improvements over versions 1 and 2. No subscale had more than one item that loaded poorly
on the latent factor, so we focused our item analyses on determining how reducing from 40
to 30, 20, or even 10 items would impact the validity of the scale.

We developed a novel method for empirically selecting item combinations that would
maximize both internal and external validity. For all 10 subscales (four relevance items or
four judgments items for each of the five foundations) we identified three criterion scales.
The first criterion scale for each subscale was the corresponding foundation subscale using
the alternative format (for instance, Harm-judgments as internal validity criterion for Harm-
relevance). The second criterion subscale was the corresponding foundation subscale from
the “taboo-tradeoffs” questionnaire (see Graham, et al., 2009, Study 3, Appendix C).
Modeled on work by Tetlock, Kristel, Elson, Green, and Lerner (2000), this questionnaire
asks participants to indicate how much money they would require to perform actions that
violate the foundations in a variety of ways (for instance, “kick a dog in the head, hard” for
Harm), including options of performing the violation for free, as well as refusing to perform
it for any amount of money. The third criterion (used for both relevance and judgments
subscales) was an external scale we expected to be related to one particular moral
foundation. For Harm the external criterion was the empathy subscale of the Interpersonal
Reactivity Index (Davis, 1983); for Fairness, the Schwartz Equality value item (Schwartz,
1992); for Ingroup, the Schwartz Loyalty value item (Schwartz, 1992); for Authority, the
Right-Wing Authoritarianism scale (Zakrisson, 2005); and for Purity, the Disgust Scale-
Revised (Haidt, McCauley, & Rozin, 1994, modified by Olatunji et al., 2008).
In order to quantify how the quality of the scale would decline if shortened, and in order to
select the combination of items that would retain the greatest internal and external validity,
we calculated correlations between every combination of items and the three criterion scales,
as well as a combined item-total correlation with all three criterion scales. An example for
Harm-Relevance is shown in Figure 1 (detailed reports of the criterion analyses for all ten
subscales can be found in the supplements). The top left panel of Figure 1 plots the corrected
item-total correlations with the three criterion scales (Harm-judgments, Harm-taboo-
tradeoffs questionnaire, and IRI-empathy, shown in the other three panels) for every single
Harm-relevance item, every 2-item combination, every 3-item combination, and the 4-item
aggregate. One can see in this figure that a single item, H (“whether or not someone was
harmed”) was negatively impacting the internal and external validity of the Harm-relevance
aggregates that included it, and that a 3-item aggregate excluding it had even better internal
and external reliabilities than the 4-item aggregate. All ten of these analyses revealed that
using the best three-item combination yielded internal and external validities as good if not
better than using all four items; moreover, we found that in most cases the optimal 2-item
combinations were nearly as good as the 3-item combinations (although the 3-item
combinations were preferable for their broader conceptual coverage). The best three items
from each subscale were retained for the fourth and final version of the MFQ, shown in the
Appendix. The 20 starred items make up the short-form MFQ.
Description of Final Items
Throughout the several rounds of item generation and selection, we sought to minimize
conceptual and empirical redundancy among items. On this point, we differ from some
approaches to scale development that prioritize high internal consistency. Internal
consistency is important, but so is comprehensive coverage of the various facets of the
construct (the scale development work of Harrison Gough [1979, 1984] is a good example
of this balance; see also John & Soto, 2007). From our point of view, it is better to have
dissimilar items that are moderately correlated but that each capture a different facet of a
foundation than it is to have similar items that are highly correlated and capture only a small
amount of the foundation’s scope. As such, our aim in item analysis was not to maximize
internal consistency via item redundancy. Instead, we sought a balance between achieving
(a) sufficient internal consistency to believe that there was a common core, and (b) maximal
item heterogeneity to increase confidence that we were representing the foundation in full.

For the moral relevance items, we attempted to cover a wide conceptual area for each
foundation while avoiding obvious culture-war issues (e.g., one item is about the moral
relevance of rights violations in the abstract, without specifying particular content such as
gun rights or gay rights). Items were generated to capture different instances of a
foundational moral concern, for instance asking about group loyalty in reference to different
specific groups (nation, family) as well as to one’s group left in the abstract.
We had two reasons for adding the judgments subscale to the relevance subscale. First, we
wanted multiple response formats to minimize the impact of variance based on response set
(for instance, some people may be more likely to indicate that everything is morally
relevant). Second, we wanted to supplement the abstract relevance assessments—which, as
self-theories about how one makes moral judgments, may be inaccurate with regard to actual
moral judgments (Nisbett & Wilson, 1977)—with contextualized items that could more
directly gauge actual moral judgments. To fill out the judgments subscale, participants need
not directly consider or be aware of the basis for their moral judgments; they just need to
decide whether they endorse or reject the action or event. In this way, the “relevance”
subscale may better assess explicit theories about what is morally relevant, and the
“judgments” subscale may better assess actual use of moral foundations in judgment (see
initial evidence for this conclusion in Graham et al., 2009, Study 2). These judgments took
the form of normative declarations (e.g., “It can never be right to kill a human being,” for
Harm), hypotheticals (e.g., “If I were a soldier and disagreed with my commanding officer’s
orders, I would obey anyway because that is my duty,” for Authority), virtue endorsements
(e.g., “Chastity is an important and valuable virtue,” for Purity), and opinions about
government policies (e.g., “When the government makes laws, the number one principle
should be ensuring that everyone is treated fairly,” for Fairness). With this variety of both
item formats and specific item content, the final version of the MFQ gauges sensitivities to
basic kinds of moral concerns, not just opinions on specific moral issues.
Sample sizes, number of items, and alphas from pilot testing on all four versions of the MFQ
are shown in Table 1. Below we describe validity analyses on the fourth and final version of
the scale shown in the Appendix.
Method
Participants and Procedure
Participants were 34,476 adults (37% female; mean age 36.2) who had previously registered
at YourMorals.org and selected to take the Moral Foundations Questionnaire. Participants
come to the website via many different routes, identified using a web tracker. In this sample,
40.5% entered the URL directly into their browser. The most common referring sites were
edge.org (29.7%), search engines (8.1%), message boards (3.9%), ted.com (2.2%), and
alternet.org (1.9%). (For an analysis demonstrating that response patterns on the MFQ are
similar for participants from diverse referring sources, see Iyer, 2009). The relevance section
preceded the judgments section, and items within each section were given in an order
randomized for each participant. A subset of this sample also chose to take one or several
other surveys on the site. This is the sample and procedure used for all internal and external
validity analyses except the test-retest, pragmatic, and incremental predictive validity
analyses, which are detailed below.
Results: Internal Validity
Scale means and internal consistencies
Means, standard deviations, and alphas for each subscale of the MFQ are presented in Table
2. Means are also given separately for liberals, moderates, conservatives, and libertarians, to

serve as points of comparison. Although the alphas are not as high as many other scales,
they indicate a reasonable internal consistency given that our goal was to gauge an
expansive range of moral concerns with a small number of items across two different item
formats.
Relations between relevance and judgments subscales
Relations between the relevance and judgments subscales are shown in Table 3. The top
panel shows zero-order correlations. To ensure that these relationships were not solely
driven by common relations to political ideology, the bottom panel shows partial
correlations controlling for politics. Both panels show convergent validity for each
foundation as measured by the two formats, as well as discriminant validity in that these
relations are stronger than relations between different foundations, despite high correlations
among many of the foundations (average same-foundation r = .48, average different-
foundation r = .14).2
Test-retest reliability
We gave the MFQ to 123 college students (mean age = 20.1, 69.9% female) from the
University of Southern California. After an average interval of 37.4 days (range 28 to 43
days), participants completed the MFQ a second time. In both instances, the MFQ was
administered via a class website which recorded the date and time of completion
automatically. Question order was randomized for each participant each time. Test-retest
Pearson correlations for each foundation score were .71 for Harm, .68 for Fairness, .69 for
Ingroup, .71 for Authority, and .82 for Purity (all p<.001). These test-retest reliabilities are
quite similar in magnitude to the internal consistencies calculated in Table 2. This suggests
that item responses are quite stable over time and that within-occasion variation is more a
function of the broad diversity of measurement rather than instability.
Exploratory factor analysis
Although Moral Foundations Theory predicts a specific factor structure for moral concerns,
we began with exploratory factor analyses to see what factors emerged from the items in the
absence of conceptual constraints. Factor analysis for all 30 items of the MFQ was
performed using direct oblimin rotation with Kaiser normalization (allowing the factors to
be correlated) and maximum likelihood estimation (Fabrigar, Wegener, McCallum, &
Strahan, 1999). Six factors with eigenvalues greater than 1 emerged, but scree plot and
factor loadings indicated that only the first two factors provided meaningful incremental
explanatory power and interpretability (only 2 of the 120 loadings on the last four factors
were above .3; see also Costello & Osborne, 2005, on factor retention from scree plot
analysis). The first two factors were retained, and are shown in Table 4. As the table
indicates, the two factors clearly corresponded to the binding foundations (Ingroup,
Authority, and Purity; factor 1) and individualizing foundations (Harm and Fairness; factor
2), and the strongest loading for all 30 items was as predicted.
Although this analysis supported our distinction between individual-focused and group-
focused moral concerns, it remains an open question whether we are justified in treating the
theoretically-derived moral foundations as five factors, rather than two. To answer this
question we turn to comparisons between different confirmatory factor analysis models.
2Correlations between the latent foundation factors can be found in Figure 2 (five correlated factors model), and zero-order
correlations between the factors are available in a supplement at the first three authors’ websites.

Confirmatory factor analysis
The large sample sizes we obtained for each version of the MFQ allowed us to create
structural equation models comparing different theoretically-derived factor structures. Table
5 describes the comparative model fitting with the final version of the MFQ. The first three
numerical columns provide fit statistics for the individual models, and the last two columns
show the degree to which each model was an improvement over the model in the row above
it. Figure 2 shows the different confirmatory factor analysis models for the full scale; as
Table 5 reflects, the same models were constructed for the relevance and judgments
subscales separately as well. In the first step, we compared nested first-order models. Our
hypothesis was that model 4 (five correlated factors: Harm, Fairness, Ingroup, Authority,
and Purity) would provide a better overall model fit than a single morality factor model (1),
two-factor model (2: individualizing and binding, corresponding to the results of the
exploratory factor analysis), and three-factor model (3: corresponding to Shweder et al.’s
(1997) ethics of autonomy, community, and divinity). All three tests (relevance subscale,
judgments subscale, and full MFQ) confirmed these predictions; the overall best model
(weighing fit and parsimony) was the five-factor model in every case.3
In the second step, we tested whether the five factors could be more parsimoniously
modeled with two correlated superordinate factors representing our theoretical distinction of
“individualizing” and “binding” foundations (see the hierarchical model in Figure 2). As
Table 6 shows, however, the model with five intercorrelated factors was a significant
improvement (again, weighing both fit and parsimony) over the hierarchical models. In
general, confirmatory factor analyses provide robust support for our five-factor
conceptualization of the moral foundations.
Results: External Validity
Relations to other scales
We identified several other scales and scale items also taken by participants at
YourMorals.org that we predicted would relate to the MFQ foundation scores. Scales were
grouped into five external criteria scale sets, one set for each foundation. Harm criterion
scales were the empathic concern subscale of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (Davis,
1983; n=134), Levenson’s (1995) Psychopathy Scale (reverse-scored; n=116), Schwartz’s
(1992; n=4,228) Benevolence subscale, and three items from the Adapted Good-Self
Assessment (Barriga, Morrison, Liau, & Gibbs, 2001; n=89) on the importance of being
kind/caring, sympathetic/compassionate, and generous/giving. Fairness scales were Social
Dominance Orientation (reverse-scored, as it measures preference for social inequalities;
Pratto, Sidanius, Stallworth, & Malle, 1994; n=1,215), importance of being fair/just on
Barriga’s Good-Self scale, and endorsement of the social justice item on Schwartz’s values
scale. Ingroup scales were the importance of being loyal/faithful on Barriga’s Good-Self
scale, and endorsement of loyalty, national security, and family security items on Schwartz’s
values scale. Authority scales were Right-Wing Authoritarianism (Zakrisson, 2005;
n=1,093), the Traditionalism subscale of the Progressive and Traditional Justice scale
(Haidt, Darley, & Gromet, 2009; n=1,384), and endorsement of the social order, authority,
respect for tradition, honoring parents, and obedience values on Schwartz’s value scale.
Purity scales were the Disgust Scale-Revised (Haidt, McCauley & Rozin, 1994 modified by
Olatunji et al., 2008; n=1,681), self-reported religious attendance (n=32,607), and
3We also tested whether a six-factor model separating Authority and Tradition (shown in Figure 2) would improve upon the five-
factor model. However, these six-factor models were a worse fit than the five-factor models, 0.60 ≤ εa ≤ 0.65; in addition, as Figure 2
shows, the Authority and Tradition factors were very highly correlated (r = .96), further supporting a single latent factor for these
items.

endorsement of the self-discipline, clean, and devout items on Schwartz’s values scale.
Items from the same scale were averaged together, and correlations between the foundations
and the scales were averaged together for each criterion group. Correlations between the
foundations and the external criterion scales are shown in Table 7. As the table shows, each
foundation was the strongest predictor for its own conceptually related group of external
scales (average r = .51, vs. average r = .14 for the off-diagonals). This provides evidence of
both convergent and discriminant validity, despite relatively substantial relations among the
foundations.
Predictive validity for social group attitudes
A subset of the participants who took the MFQ also took a survey in which they reported
their gut reactions to various social groups. We constructed this survey by first identifying
groups conceptually related to each foundation because they represent either virtues or vices
of that foundation. For instance, we predicted that people whose morality rested heavily on
the Harm/care foundation would have especially positive reactions to “caring” groups such
as nurses, and especially negative reactions to “harming” groups like hunters. The
foundation relevance of each group was identified a priori by the authors. Harm-related
groups were nurses, environmentalists, pacifists, vegetarians, and hunters (r). Fairness-
related groups were ACLU members, labor unions, rich people (r), and CEOs (r). Ingroup-
related groups were Americans, U.S. Government, flag burners (r), and illegal immigrants
(r). Authority-related groups were soldiers, police officers, U.S. Marines, U.S. Military,
people who spank their children, and anarchists (r). Purity-related groups were virgins,
highly religious people, spiritual people, atheists (r), prostitutes (r), homosexuals (r), people
who have casual sex (r), and people with tattoos or piercings (r). Groups indicated by “(r)”
represented vices of a foundation and were reverse-scored, and for U.S.-specific groups only
U.S. citizens were included in the analyses. Because attitudes toward social groups and
moral foundations scores are both related to political ideology, we used partial correlations
controlling for political ideology to see which groups would be uniquely predicted by one or
more foundations. Partial correlations between foundations and all social groups were
averaged for each set of foundation-related groups; these averages are shown in Table 8. As
the table shows, each foundation was the strongest predictor (above and beyond politics) of
attitudes toward conceptually related social groups, providing further evidence of predictive
and discriminant validity. Beyond validation of the scale, these results also suggest that
attitudes about social groups are in part moral judgments about those groups. Moral
Foundations Theory and the MFQ may be useful for researchers who want to know which
moral concerns are related to prejudice toward any particular group.
Incremental predictive validity
The preceding sections establish that the theorized model of Moral Foundations as five
interrelated factors is a better fit than other plausible models, and that each of the five factors
predict foundation-relevant outcomes. An open question is whether the MFQ has predictive
validity beyond existing measures. Because it measures domains that are not present in other
theoretical conceptions of morality—Ingroup, Authority, and Purity—it surely expands the
predictive validity of morality measures. However, even broader measures exist, such as the
Schwartz Values Scale, which measures endorsement of ten broad classes of values. This
scale contains several values and subscale factors that conceptually overlap with the moral
foundations (e.g., Benevolence with Harm/care, Traditionalism with Authority/respect), and
many self-interested values that we consider to be outside the moral domain and not covered
by the MFQ (e.g., Achievement, Hedonism). Even though Moral Foundations Theory has a
different conceptual starting point (an evolutionary account of why humans have the moral
intuitions they do, contra Schwartz’s factor-analytic approach), it is nonetheless worthwhile
to test whether the MFQ has predictive validity beyond Schwartz’s scale in predicting a

variety of scales, opinions, and self-reported behaviors relevant to morality. Because
Schwartz’s scale is larger both in terms of subscales (10 vs. 5) and items (58 vs. 30), this is a
particularly tough test of the predictive validity of the MFQ.
Data for these analyses came from 10,652 visitors to YourMorals.org who took both the
MFQ and the Schwartz Values Scale (SVS), 92% of whom also took other scales or
measures. We used two-step regressions to test whether the five MFQ subscales added
incremental predictive validity beyond the ten SVS subscales for the external criteria (scales
and attitudes toward foundation-related social groups) described above, as well as for
positions on a wide range of political issues. Note that this analysis focuses on the
incremental validity of the aggregate MFQ in comparison to the aggregate SVS, rather than
investigating which of the particular moral concerns predict each criterion variable (for such
work, see Koleva, Graham, Iyer, Ditto, & Haidt, 2010).
In every analysis, the MFQ made a significant improvement to prediction when added to the
SVS (average ΔR² = 8%, all ΔR² significant at p < .001). To provide a point of comparison,
we repeated this analysis by adding the 44-item Big Five personality inventory to the SVS,
which yielded an average ΔR² of only 2%. R² and ΔR² for the scales and foundation-related
social group averages can be found in Table 9. We also investigated R² for the MFQ alone,
to further compare its predictive validity with that of the SVS. As the bolded values in Table
9 show, the MFQ was actually a more powerful predictor than the SVS for most of the
scales and political issue positions, and all of the social group attitudes. Given that the SVS
is a comprehensive, large, and well-validated measure of values, the MFQ is clearing a high
bar in providing unique predictive validity for outcomes relevant for moral and political
psychology, and for the psychology of prejudice.
Generalizability
Because every step of the scale development used large heterogeneous samples, we can be
more confident about the MFQ’s generalizability than if we had used college students only
(Sears, 1986). However, the samples obtained at ProjectImplicit.org and at YourMorals.org
are not representative of any national or international population – the current sample is
disproportionately from the U.S. (80%), white (87%), male (63%), and educated (mean
education between “completed college” and “some graduate school”) compared to
international or U.S. national averages.
Thanks to the large sample sizes, however, we were able to test whether the five-factor
model of moral concerns was consistent across national and geographic groups. All
participants self-reported their current country of residence, the country in which they grew
up (if different), and the age at which they moved (if they grew up in a different country).
For participants who reported moving to their current country at age 14 or older, the country
in which they reported growing up was used for the cross-cultural analysis. We created 12
location codes, four of which indicated the four nations from which the largest number of
participants had come (U.S., Canada, U.K., Australia); the other eight location codes
indicated multi-nation regions of the world (i.e. East Asia, Middle East). Model fit
information for each location code is shown in Table 10. As the table shows, the five-factor
model of the MFQ is a reasonable or good fit (all εa < .06, all CFI >.7) for all 11 world
regions for which we were able to run the fit analyses, providing evidence that the
measurement and theory of five foundational moral concerns is not specific to U.S. or
Western participants. Notably, although the five-foundation model is a good fit in all these
areas, the data shows much cross-cultural variation in the patterns of moral foundation
endorsement. Even controlling for politics, age, gender, religious attendance, and education,
world region is a significant (ps < .001) predictor of all five foundation scores, indicating

that the scale is useful for measuring and describing cultural differences in moral concerns.
We turn to such uses in the next section.
Results: Pragmatic Validity
“Pragmatism asks its usual question. ‘Grant an idea or belief to be true,’ it says,
‘what concrete difference will its being true make in anyone's actual life? How will
the truth be realized? What experiences will be different from those which would
obtain if the belief were false? What, in short, is the truth's cash-value in
experiential terms?’”
— William James (1907/1998), Pragmatism, p. 97
Suppose you were to grant, in a Jamesian spirit, that Moral Foundations Theory is true, that
there really are a few basic intuitive foundations upon which all cultures construct systems
of virtue and vice. What is the “cash-value” of this theory? What new questions does it
allow researchers to ask about morality, and what new understandings can measurement of
its constructs provide? We address this section to researchers who don’t expect to use the
Moral Foundations Questionnaire in their own research, but would like to know what the
theory and measure can tell them about moral psychology. First and foremost, MFT
provides a broadened conception of morality, not only in content domain (including group-
focused as well as individual-focused concerns) but – by showing how moral judgments
influence attitudes and behavior in social situations far removed from quandary ethics – in
life domain as well (Rozin, 2006). For instance, the above validation exercises with external
scales and social group attitudes showed that many traits and attitudes that don’t seem to be
about morality on the surface nevertheless show a systematic and theoretically meaningful
relationship to moral concerns measured by the MFQ. We present here three additional
findings made possible by MFT’s broadened definition of morality, and its finer conceptual
resolution of morality’s components.
1.
Robustness of ideological patterns across cultures. Using a variety of measures and
methods, Graham et al. (2009) showed that liberals value Harm and Fairness
concerns more than conservatives, while conservatives value Ingroup, Authority,
and Purity concerns more than liberals. The vast majority of these participants,
however, came from the United States, leaving open the question of whether these
patterns were limited to the particular ideological conflicts of the United States.
Table 11 shows correlations between political ideology4 and the five foundations
for the different world areas described in the Generalizability section. The
correlations indicate that the liberal-conservative patterns found in the U.S. are
robust across national and cultural contexts, both in terms of direction (negative
correlations [liberals higher] for Harm and Fairness, positive correlations
[conservatives higher] for Ingroup, Authority, and Purity) and in terms of
magnitude: correlations are consistently strongest for Authority and Purity, and
weakest for Harm. This suggests that across cultures, the most intractable political
debates are likely to involve concerns related to respect for traditions/authorities
and physical/spiritual purity, while the greatest degree of moral commonality may
be found in issues related to harm and care. It also reinforces the claim that political
ideology can be self-assessed and that the unidimensional left-right construct has
some degree of common meaning across societies, despite differences in political
party structures and particular national issues (Jost, 2006).
4Because the terms “liberal” and “conservative” can mean different things in different nations (i.e., the Liberal Party in Australia is
actually center-right ideologically), the political identification item on YourMorals.org clarifies to participants that the items from
“very liberal” to “very conservative” should be read as “very left-wing” to “very right-wing.”

East-West differences in foundation endorsement. Moving beyond politics, the
international MFQ data can also be used to describe cross-cultural differences in
moral concerns. We compared participants from Eastern cultures (South Asia, East
Asia, and Southeast Asia, n=2,258) to participants from Western cultures (U.S.,
U.K., Canada, and Western Europe, n=104,893). Eastern participants showed
stronger concerns about Ingroup (mean difference=.23, t(107149)=12.42, p < .
0001, d = .08) and Purity (mean difference=.25, t(107149)=10.51, p < .0001, d = .
06) compared to Western participants, and were only very slightly more concerned
about Harm, Fairness, and Authority (mean differences < .1, ts < 7, ds < .04). The
fact that differences are concentrated in Ingroup and Purity makes some sense in
light of established cultural differences in collectivism (Triandis, 1995) and the role
of purity concerns in daily life and religious practice, particularly in South Asia
(Shweder et al., 1997). But it is noteworthy that there are not large differences in
Authority, given greater sensitivity to social hierarchy (Power Distance scores) in
eastern nations (Hofstede, 2001). The small effect sizes for all the East-West
differences suggest that variation within cultures (e.g., by gender or political
ideology) will exceed the east-West variations given so much attention in cross-
cultural research. Here we see that the increased resolution afforded by MFT allows
us to find moral differences we would not have been able to find otherwise –
differences that open up intriguing questions for further research.
3.
Gender differences in foundation endorsement. The MFQ reveals interesting
gender differences as well. In the large international dataset collected at
YourMorals.org (49,428 women, 68,812 men), women score higher than men on
Harm (mean difference=.47, t(118238)=99.16, p < .0001, d = .58), Fairness (mean
difference=.16, t(118238)=37.75, p < .0001, d = .22), and Purity (mean difference=.
16, t(118238)=25.10, p < .0001, d = .15), with men just barely higher on Ingroup
and Authority (mean differences < .06, ds < .06). Women were more concerned
than men about Harm, Fairness, and Purity, even controlling for political ideology.
As the effect sizes show, these gender differences were much stronger than the
differences between Eastern and Western cultures. The gender patterns make sense
in light of previous research on empathy (Davis, 1983), egalitarianism (Arts &
Gelissen, 2001), and disgust sensitivity (Druschel & Sherman, 1999), but they also
show an important divergence from the political patterns in that Purity is here
grouped with Harm and Fairness, rather than Ingroup and Authority. Here too the
finer resolution and broadened scope of MFT allowed us to find and describe
differences in moral personality not possible before.
General Discussion
Moral Foundations Theory (Haidt & Joseph, 2004; Haidt & Graham, 2007) was created by
selecting the closest links between evolutionary accounts of human sociality and
anthropological accounts of the breadth and variability of the moral domain (see especially
Fiske, 1992, and Shweder et al., 1997). The findings reported in this article suggest that
those anthropologists were right. From a purely descriptive perspective, the domain of
morality consists of more than just “prescriptive judgments of justice, rights, and welfare”
(Turiel, 1983, p. 3). Furthermore, we found that one does not need to travel to non-Western
nations to find this broader conception of morality. In every country and world region we
examined, people on the political right placed greater emphasis on concerns about ingroup
loyalty, respect for authorities and traditions, and physical/spiritual purity than did people on
the political left.

Our data confirm that concerns about Harm and Fairness are so widespread that they might
be said to be universally used foundations of morality (upon which cultures construct
differing ideas as to what counts as harm, or what kinds of distributions are fair). But many
people and cultures are also concerned about the proper relationships of individuals to
groups, authorities, institutions, and roles. And many people and cultures are concerned
about how people treat their own bodies—whether they treat them as playgrounds for their
own pleasure, or as temples created by God to house a soul within. These additional moral
concerns have not been included in measures of morality, until now.
The Moral Foundations Questionnaire
The Moral Foundations Questionnaire fills the need for a theoretically-grounded scale
covering the full range of human moral concerns. We found substantial evidence that the
scale is reliable and valid. The scale is internally consistent (both within and between two
question formats) while maintaining conceptual coverage of diverse manifestations of
foundation-related concerns. Test-retest analyses showed stability of foundation subscale
scores over time. External validations of the MFQ using widely-used scales, as well as
attitudes toward conceptually related social groups, showed convergent, discriminant, and
predictive validity. Factor analyses confirmed our theoretical parsing of the moral domain
into five sets of concerns: the five-factor model fit the data better (weighing both fit and
parsimony) than competing models, and this five-factor representation provided a good fit
for participants in 11 different world areas. In addition to the scale itself, we expect that the
method introduced in this paper (see Figure 1) for empirically selecting items to maximize
both internal and external validity will also be of use to researchers.
The best existing instrument for assessing moral concerns beyond harm and fairness is the
Schwartz Values Scale (SVS; Schwartz, 1992), which includes group-level values such as
“tradition” and “conformity.” However, the SVS was created to measure a broad spectrum
of values; it was not designed to cover the moral domain specifically, and it does not cover
concerns about group-loyalty and spiritual purity. In a head-to-head comparison, the MFQ
showed incremental predictive validity beyond the SVS for a diverse array of external scales
related to moral personality, attitudes toward social groups, and opinions about moral and
political issues (see Table 9). Further, in most cases, the MFQ performed even better than
the SVS in overall variance explained of criterion variables, despite its shorter length and
narrower conceptual coverage. This further illustrates the MFQ’s effective measurement
properties, balancing relatively short length and wide coverage of the moral domain.
What MFT and the MFQ can Reveal about Morality
The research reported here indicates that the MFQ is a reliable and valid instrument for
measuring a broad range of moral concerns. But in the process of developing and validating
the MFQ, we also generated a number of substantive discoveries about moral psychology,
such as:
1.
A map of the moral domain. Because it distinguishes five kinds of moral concerns,
and gives separate evolutionary accounts to explain each of their origins (Haidt &
Joseph, 2007), MFT is not as parsimonious as theories of morality that try to derive
the entire moral domain from one or two principles or processes (usually kin
selection plus reciprocal altruism – see Dawkins, 1976; Hauser, 2006; Joyce, 2006).
However, comparisons of different structural models revealed that the five-factor
solution is an improvement over other theoretically-derived models, even taking
into account the relative loss of parsimony. Analyses of international data showed
that this five-factor model was a good fit in every area of the world we were able to
examine. This provides empirical evidence for MFT’s central claim about the
structure of human morality, and points toward the usefulness of this added

complexity in revealing new findings about moral similarities and differences
across individuals, groups, and cultures.
2.
A guide to where the action is. We found some small and easily interpretable cross-
cultural differences in moral foundation scores: people in Eastern cultures were
slightly more likely to value Ingroup and Purity than people in Western cultures.
As with all research that relies upon educated participants, our cross-national
differences would probably have been much larger if we had found a way to survey
rural villagers and the urban poor in Asia. Nonetheless, the cross-national
differences we did find were dwarfed by the within-nation (or within-region)
differences we examined, including both ideological differences and sex
differences (women valued Harm, Fairness, and Purity more than men, even
controlling for political ideology). With reliable measures of these different kinds
of moral concerns, social and personality psychologists can now begin to examine
many such patterns of similarities and dissimilarities, as well as the processes
behind them.
3.
A method for discovering moral prejudices. The finer resolution offered by the
MFQ also revealed the potential role of moral judgment in prejudice. When we
examined attitudes toward various social groups, we found that MFQ subscales
indicated varying patterns of moral concerns that might lead some people to dislike
some groups. This suggests that attitudes toward social groups may often be
expressions of moral judgments about those groups – vague intuitions or explicit
convictions that a particular social group upholds or violates one or more
foundational concerns. The moral foundations can thus be used as a kind of
decoder ring, allowing us to see multiple and sometimes unexpected moral threads
connecting seemingly unrelated attitudes and opinions (cf. Koleva et al, 2010). This
possibility emphasizes our functional definition of morality as a description of what
motivates people to suppress selfishness, rather than a prescriptive definition of
how one ought to behave. By describing and quantifying a broadened range of
human moral concerns, MFT and the MFQ can aid in our understanding of the
dangers of morality, as well as the benefits.
Limitations and Directions for Further Research
The map of the moral domain that we offer is provisional. We hope that other researchers
will help us improve it. Here are four next steps:
1.
Obtain other samples. While the findings reported in this article held across tens of
thousands of participants from around the world, caution is warranted. Most
importantly, our data came from volunteers who are not representative of any
definable population. Nonetheless, the consistency of effects across 11 nations or
regions suggests that the observed patterns are, at least, widespread. It will be
useful to compare the present findings with representative samples in each nation.
As a start, the MFQ has been given to nationally representative samples in the USA
(Smith & Vaisey, 2010), which replicated the basic pattern of ideological
differences that we report in Table 11. The problem of non-representativeness is
exacerbated in non-English-speaking nations, because all of our respondents were
adult English-speakers with access to the Internet. Future work will be needed to
validate and refine the scale for use with other populations. This work has already
begun, using translations of the MFQ into Chinese, Croatian, Dutch, Italian, Polish,
Russian, and Spanish (all available at MoralFoundations.org), and field work with
populations not reachable via online research (such as the inhabitants of a
municipal dump outside Managua, Nicaragua; Graham, Cox, & Casablanca, 2010).

2.
Test developmental hypotheses. Kohlberg traced the development of reasoning
about justice. Gilligan examined the development of reasoning about care. Moral
Foundations Theory indicates that we also need basic descriptive work on the
development of judgment and reasoning about ingroups, authority, and purity. A
question of particular interest will be whether moral maturity involves shifting from
one pattern of foundation-usage to another. For example, Kohlberg’s scoring
manual acknowledged that people sometimes justified their judgments by referring
to authority and tradition, but he believed that this was an immature (conventional)
form of morality, which would be transcended with age and additional
opportunities for role taking. As noted in the introduction, this view set off a
“stage-ideology” debate, in which Kohlberg was criticized for treating a liberal set
of values as a developmental progression beyond a conservative set of values (cf.
Emler et al, 1983). As a descriptive account of the range of human moral concerns,
MFT does not make normative claims about which kinds of concerns are better
than others (claims about which are more complex, or more mature than others –
such as Kohlberg’s [1971] “naturalistic fallacy” – fall into this normativity).
However, future work on how the foundations develop and change in response to
environmental changes and life events could inform this debate by giving more
information about how people come to have the moral concerns they do (and
possibly even why people in the same culture and environment hold different moral
values sacred). Clearly, more work is needed on the development of moral
foundations in children, and on the dynamics of moral change throughout
adolescence and adulthood.
3.
Go beyond self-report. An additional limitation is that the data reported in this
article consists entirely of self-report measurements of attributes, attitudes, and
judgments. Future steps improving the map of the moral domain should include
analyses of morally relevant behaviors, life events, and implicit attitudes.
4.
Look for more foundations. The map we have offered is surely incomplete. Because
of the theory-driven origin of MFT, and the strong empirical support for the theory
reported here, we believe that the five foundations offer a good initial map of the
major moral continents. However, it is quite possible that later research, using
different items or different methods, will reveal that one of these continents is, like
Eurasia, really two continents. For example, we included concerns about liberty in
the Fairness foundation, because Fairness gives rise to notions of rights. Whether
such a grouping can be sustained with additional scrutiny is an open question, as is
the question of whether a single foundation underlies intuitions about equality of
opportunities and those about equality of outcomes. It is also possible that two of
the five continents are really riding on a single tectonic plate. For example, Ingroup
and Authority tend to intercorrelate highly across analyses, but our investigation so
far suggests that it is reasonable and useful to keep them separate. Finally, it is
possible that some major islands remain to be named. For example, others have
suggested wisdom, waste, authenticity, truth, and self-control as candidate
foundations.
Conclusion
People disagree about the size and content of the moral domain – that is, about what
“morality” means. Researchers therefore need theories that encompass the true breadth of
human morality, and they need measurement tools that can detect a broad array of moral
concerns. In this article we presented Moral Foundations Theory as a way of thinking about
morality that goes beyond harm and fairness (with inspiration from Shweder et al., 1997).
And we presented the Moral Foundations Questionnaire as a reliable, valid, and easy-to-use

extending, critiquing, and otherwise improving psychology’s map of the moral domain.

Example of item selection procedure for final version of MFQ
Note. Figure shows how much is gained, in terms of correlations with internal and external
validity criteria scales, as the number of items in each subscale is increased from 1–4. The
panels show analyses of all possible item combinations in the Harm Relevance subscale,
plotting their correlations with the Harm judgments subscale (lower right quadrant), Harm
sacredness scale (upper right), IRI-empathy subscale (lower left), and corrected item-total
correlations with all three criterion scales. Letters refer to items in the Harm relevance
subscale: H=Harmed, E=Emotionally, C=Cruel, W=Weak (all items can be found in the
Appendix except Harmed, which was dropped because of this analysis).
