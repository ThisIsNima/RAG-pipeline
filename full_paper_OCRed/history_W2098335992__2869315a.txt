Research scholars are products of their times but their work also changes the 
way scientific issues are studied after them. This reciprocal influence between 
the outlook of a period and the research people do has been particularly 
evident in the study of psychological stress and the emotions during the period 
of my academic life from post-World War II to the present. In pursuing issues 
about stress and the emotions that have been of particular interest to me, 
historical shifts of great moment are revealed, which I intend to highlight in 
this essay.

2 LAZARUS 
EARLY APPROACHES TO STRESS 
The term stress, meaning hardship or adversity, can be found-though without 
a programmatic focus-at least as early as the 14th century (Lumsden 1981). 
It first seems to have achieved technical importance, however, in the 17th 
century in the work of the prominent physicist-biologist, Robert Hooke (see 
Hinkle 1973). Hooke was concerned with how man-made structures, such as 
bridges, must be designed to carry heavy loads and resist buffeting by winds, 
earthquakes, and other natural forces that could destroy them. Load referred to 
a weight on a structure, stress was the area over which the load impinged, and 
strain was the deformation of the structure created by the interplay of both 
load and stress. 
Although these usages have changed somewhat in the transition from phys­
ics to other disciplines, Hooke's analysis greatly influenced early 20th century 
models of stress in physiology, psychology, and sociology. The theme that 
survives in modem times is the idea of stress as an external load or demand on 
a biological, social, or psychological system. 
During World War II there was considerable interest in emotional break­
down in response to the "stresses" of combat (e.g. Grinker & Spiegel 1945). 
The emphasis on the psychodynamics of breakdown-referred to as "battle 
fatigue" or "war neurosis"-is itself historically noteworthy, because in World 
War I the perspective had been neurological rather than psychological; the 
World War I term for breakdown was "shell shock," which expressed a vague 
but erroneous notion that the dysfunction resulted from brain damage created 
by the sound of exploding shells. 
After World War II it became evident that many conditions of ordinary 
life-for example, marriage, growing up, facing school exams, and being 
ill-could produce effects comparable to those of combat. This led to a grow­
ing interest in stress as a cause of human distress and dysfunction. The domi­
nant model-parallel with Hooke's analysis-was basically that of input (load 
or demand on systems) and output (strain, deformation, breakdown). The main 
epistemology of the American academic psychology of those days, namely, 
behaviorism and positivism, made this type of model appear scientific and 
straightforward, though it turned out to be insufficient. 
When I appeared on the scene, the discipline's interest in stress-presum­
ably an esoteric topic-was modest, and the concept had not yet been applied 
to the more ordinary conditions of daily life. The military wanted to know how 
to select men who would be stress resistant, and to train them to manage stress. 
The major research questions of the immediately post-World War II period 
centered on the effects of stress and how they could be explained and pre­
dicted. The research style was experimental, reflecting the widely accepted 
view at the time that the most dependable way to obtain knowledge was in the 
laboratory .

PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS AND THE EMOTIONS 3 
It soon became apparent, however, that these questions did not have a 
simple answer. In the 1950s, my colleagues and I, along with many others, 
soon discovered that stressful conditions did not produce dependable effects; 
for some persons the stress aroused by a given condition was great, while for 
others it was small; and under stress conditions, depending on the task, the 
performance for some was markedly impaired, for others it was improved, and 
for still others there was no demonstrable effect (e.g. Lazarus & Eriksen 1952). 
We concluded that to understand what was happening we had to take into 
account individual differences in motivational and cognitive variables, which 
intervened between the stressor and the reaction (Lazarus et al 1952). Our 
1952 article, incidently, was one of the two most widely read in that journal 
(as surveyed by the editor) in that academic year; the other was by Brown & 
Farber (1951) which, expressing the zeitgeist, was a neobehavioristic analysis 
of frustration and a treatment of emotion as an intervening variable. Psychol­
ogy had barely begun to move away from stimUlus-response (S-R) models to 
stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) models in an early stage of what later 
was called the cognitive revolution by North Americans. The same mediating 
variables are now well-established features of current theories of stress and 
emotion. 
I note, parenthetically, that psychology has long been ambivalent about 
individual differences, opting for the view that its scientific task is to note 
invariances and develop general laws. Variations around such laws are apt to 
be considered errors of measurement, though they must be understood if 
reasonably accurate prediction is to be possible. 
Hooke too was interested in individual differences in the elasticity of met­
als, which were a factor in their resistance to strain. For example, cast iron is 
hard and brittle and breaks easily, but wrought iron is soft and malleable and 
bends without breaking. This physical phenomenon is also used as a metaphor 
for resistance to psychological stress. Thus, the capacity of metals to resist 
deformation presaged interest in individual differences in the resiliency of 
people under stress. 
The analogy is evident today in the vigorous study of the personality traits 
and coping processes that help some people resist the deleterious effects of 
stress better than others. Some of the personality traits that appear to be 
associated with resilience include constructive thinking (Epstein & Meier 
1989), hardiness (Maddi & Kobasa 1984; see also Orr & Westman 1990), 
hope (Snyder et al 1991), learned resourcefulness (Rosenbaum 1990), opti­
mism-shades of Horatio Alger and Norman Vincent Peale-(Scheier & 
Carver 1987), self-efficacy (Bandura 1982), and sense of coherence (An­
tonovsky 1987). 
The study of stress has been plagued by an inconsistent and potentially 
confusing use of terms to denote the variables of the stress process. In the 
medical tradition, for example, stress is treated as a set of psychological and 
physiological reactions to noxious agents; Selye used stressor to denote the

agent, stress to denote the reaction; sociologists speak of stress as the disturb­
ing agent (e.g. social disequilibrium; Smelser 1963) and of strain as the 
collective reaction (e.g. a panic or riot). 
Despite these different usages, however, certain essential meanings are 
always involved. Whatever words are used to describe the stress process, four 
concepts must always be considered: 1. a causal external or internal agent, 
which Hooke called a load and others call stress or a stressor. In my own 
analyses, I emphasize the person-environment relationship and relational 
meaning (defined below); 2. an evaluation (by a mind or a physiological 
system) that distinguishes what is threatening or noxious from what is benign; 
3. coping processes used by the mind (or body) to deal with stressful demands; 
and 4. a complex pattern of effects on mind and body, often referred to as the 
stress reaction. 
Because my focus is psychological rather than physiological stress, I 
should digress briefly to point up the distinction. Early on, the two kinds of 
stress were unified under homeostatic concepts-and in the related concept of 
activation. Stress represented a deviation from some norm or steady state. The 
principle of homeostasis was initially described by Claude Bernard, and its 
mechanisms were later elaborated further by Walter Cannon (1939), as most 
psychologists know. 
An address by Hans Selye to the American Psychological Association in 
1950 stimulated great interest in the overlaps between physiological and psy­
chological stress. Se1ye (1956/1976) shifted attention from the catecholamines 
of the adrenal medulla, which Cannon had focused on, to the steroids of the 
adrenal cortex. Selye's General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS) emphasized that 
any agent noxious to the tissues (a stressor) would produce more or less the 
same orchestrated physiological defense (stress reaction). The GAS may be 
thought of as the physiological analogue of the psychological concept of 
coping. 
Psychological stressors were said also to produce the GAS. Yet in research 
that has not gotten widespread attention, Mason et al (1976) presented data 
suggesting that corticosteroid secretion may be more or less specific to psy­
chological stress and not particularly responsive to physiological stresses such 
as heat, exercise, and hunger. Although there are important overlaps between 
them, psychological stress and physiological stress require entirely different 
levels of analysis (see Lazarus 1966; Lazarus & Folkman 1984). What gener­
ates physiological stress-that is, what is noxious to tissues-is not the same 
as what is stressful ("noxious") psychologically. 
Indeed, the differences between physiological and psychological stress are 
profound and center on an issue that psychologists have long had great diffi­
culty dealing with, namely, personal meaning. The key question is how to 
define a load or stressor psychologically. I deal, below, with the question of 
what an individual considers a harm, threat, challenge, or benefit. Notice that 
in speaking of several kinds of states relevant to psychological stress and

PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS AND THE EMOTIONS 5 
emotion (namely, harm, threat, challenge, and benefit) I abandon the early 
idea that stress is merely a form of activation. Such a unidimensional con­
cept-degree of stress-ignored qualitative differences. 
There have been two influential qualitative expansions of the stress con­
cept. First, although Selye (1956/1976) had originally postulated a general, 
nonspecific physiological response to any stressor, late in his life (1974) he 
drew a health-centered distinction between eustress and distress. Eustress was 
the good kind of stress because it was associated, presumably, with positive 
feelings and healthy bodily states; distress was the bad kind, associated with 
negative feelings and disturbed bodily states. 
Unfortunately, Selye did not tell us clearly what the differences were, 
psychologically and physiologically. We might guess, of course, that, consis­
tent with his views about the GAS, the differences would involve adrenal 
corticosteroids, some of which are protective (anabolic) while others are de­
structive (catabolic). The recent explosion of interest in, and the development 
of technology for measuring, immune response variables and processes offer 
additional means of distinguishing the two kinds. For example, eustress may 
enhance immune system competence while distress may impair it. 
Second, I had early on (Lazarus 1966) drawn a distinction among three 
kinds of stress, harm, threat, and challenge (Lazarus 1966, 1981; Lazarus & 
Launier 1978; Lazarus & Folkman 1984). Harm refers to psychological dam­
age that had already been done---e.g. an irrevocable loss. Threat is the antici­
pation of harm that has not yet taken place but may be imminent. Challenge 
results from difficult demands that we feel confident about overcoming by 
effectively mobilizing and deploying our coping resources. 
These different kinds of psychological stress states are presumably brought 
about by different antecedent conditions, both in the environment and within 
the person, and have different consequences. For example, threat is an un­
pleasant state of mind that may seriously block mental operations and impair 
functioning, while challenge is exhilarating and associated with expansive, 
often outstanding performance. To the extent that we take these variations 
seriously, stress cannot be considered in terms of a single dimension such as 
activation. As will be seen below, such a recognition involves considering 
diverse emotional states, some negative, some positive. 
THE COGNITIVE MEDIATIONAL APPROACH: 
APPRAISAL 
Defmition of the psychologically noxious has been the central theme of my 
theoretical and research efforts from the beginning. Allow me to summarize 
my research in this area before turning to the parallel problem of the cognitive 
mediation of the emotions-my current main concern.

6 LAZARUS 
Although a number of influential early writers adopted the view that psy­
chological stress is dependent on cognitive mediation (e.g. Arnold 1960; Grin­
ker & Spiegel 1945; Janis 1958; Mechanic 1962), the cognitive movement in 
North American psychology did not get fully under way until the 1970s. This 
view is centered on the concept of appraisal, which is the process that medi­
ates-I would prefer to say actively negotiates-between, on the one hand, the 
demands, constraints, and resources of the environment and, on the other, the 
goal hierarchy and personal beliefs of the individual. 
I believe the programmatic efforts of my colleagues and me in the 1960s 
(e.g. Lazarus 1966, 1968; Lazarus et al 1970) helped convince many of those 
still wedded to an input-output conceptualization (along with many newcom­
ers to the scene) that appraisal played a significant role in stress reactions. A 
powerful tide in psychology--eventually becoming a tidal wave that seems to 
have swept old epistemologies aside-has moved us from behaviorism toward 
a much freer outlook in the United States. Our psychologists, the main excep­
tion being Skinner (1953, 1990), have become less hesitant about referring to 
what goes on in the mind; we are now less reluctant to explain human and 
animal actions and reactions in terms of thought processes. 
My colleagues and I employed a simple experimental paradigm designed to 
create psychological stress as naturalistically as possible in the laboratory. We 
had subjects watch stressful films while we periodically sampled their subjec­
tive reports of stress and continuously recorded their autonomic nervous sys­
tem activity (primarily as reflected in heart rate and skin conductance). 
Although a number of films were used in this research, two were particu­
larly important. One presented a series of subincision operations-a male rite 
of passage among the Arunta of Australia. The other, a film designed to teach 
woodworking personnel how to avoid shop accidents, depicted such bloody 
accidents as a worker being fatally impaled on a board thrust from a circular 
saw and a worker getting his finger cut off. 
We used recorded speech passages to orient viewers before the films were 
shown. Their purpose was to influence the way subjects construed what was 
happening in the movie (e.g. Lazarus & Alfert 1964; Speisman et al 1964). 
These passages were based on ego-defense theory, which posited certain 
themes people used to protect themselves from threat. 
One passage, for example, mimicked denial-"The people in the film are 
not hurt or distressed by what is happening," or "These accidents didn't really 
happen but were staged for their effect." Another mimicked intellectualization 
or distancing-"This is an interesting anthropological study of aboriginal 
customs," or "The accidents portrayed in this film provide the basis for in­
structions about how to avoid injuries in a woodworking shop." A third em­
phasized the main sources of threat in the film-"Many of the people you see 
in this film suffer severe pain and infection from these rituals." The effects of 
these experimental treatments were compared with each other and with a

PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS AND THE EMOTIONS 7 
control condition that involved no attempt to influence the way subjects con­
strued what was happening. 
These orientation passages had powerful effects on self-reports of distress 
and on psychophysiological stress reactions (heart rate and skin conductance). 
Denial and distancing passages markedly lowered these reactions compared 
with the control; the threat passage raised them. The tendency of the passages 
to reduce stress levels could be predicted on the basis of differences among 
viewers' cognitive styles. 
In an attempt to understand what was happening, I shifted from an empha­
sis on ego defenses to a general concept of appraisal as the cognitive mediator 
of stress reactions. I began to view appraisal as a universal process in which 
people (and other animals) constantly evaluate the significance of what is 
happening for their personal well-being. In effect, I considered psychological 
stress to be a reaction to personal harms and threats of various kinds that 
emerged out of the person-environment relationship. But more of this below. 
In subsequent experiments, we had subjects await a source of stress for 
different periods-e.g. an electric shock that was anticipated but never actu­
ally occurred (Folkins 1970; Monat et al 1973), or a bloody accident (on film) 
. that had been foreshadowed by a flashback (Nomikos et al 1968). These and 
other psychophysiological studies showed that the degree of stress reaction 
depended on evaluative thoughts (appraisal and coping). In tum the contents 
of these thoughts, such as "How bad will it be," depended on how long they 
had to wait for the harmful confrontation. A strong empirical case was being 
made that appraisal and coping processes shaped the stress reaction, and that 
these processes, in tum, were influenced by variables in the environment and 
within the person. 
Such reasoning was consistent with the expansion in the 1960s and 1970s 
of cognitive mediational views in psychology generally. The outlook was 
anticipated by many illustrious figures in North American psychology, includ­
ing Asch, Harlow, Heider, Kelly, McClelland, Murphy, Rotter, and White, as 
well as their intellectual mentors, Lewin and Murray, and still others who 
worked within the psychoanalytic framework. We often forget too that this 
outlook dominated classical Greek and European thought, a point I return to 
below. In any event, psychologists could now seriously and programmatically 
ask what must be going on in the mind to influence people to act and react as 
they do. 
Nor is this way of thinking pure phenomenology. Because of different 
goals and beliefs, because there is often too much to attend to, and because the 
stimulus array is often ambiguous, people are selective both in what they pay 
attention to and in what their appraisals take into account. Even when an 
individual's appraisal deviates from the norm it may still result in a good 
match between the appraisal and reality. There are many realities rather than a 
single one, and deviance is not necessarily pathology.

8 LAZARUS 
COPING WITH STRESS 
As the cognitive mediational outlook developed further, the coping process 
gained in importance too (Lazarus 1966; Lazarus et alI974). Because psycho­
logical stress defines an unfavorable person-environment relationship, its es­
sence is process and change rather than structure or stasis. We alter our 
circumstances, or how they are interpreted, to make them appear more favor­
able-an effort called coping. 
Traditional approaches to coping had emphasized traits or styles-that is, 
stable properties of personality. In contrast, my own analysis and research 
(Lazarus 1966, 1981; Lazarus & Folkman 1984; Lazarus & Launier 1978) 
emphasized coping as process-a person's ongoing efforts in thought and 
action to manage specific demands appraised as taxing or overwhelming. 
Although stable coping styles do exist and are important, coping is highly 
contextual, since to be effective it must change over time and across different 
stressful conditions (e.g. Folkman & Lazarus 1985). Empirical evaluation of 
this idea requires study of the same persons over time and across diverse 
stressful encounters. The Berkeley Stress and Coping Project, which got under 
way in the late 1970s and continued to the late 1980s (see Lazarus & Folkman 
1987 for a review), addressed the contextual side of coping in a number of 
field studies. 
Coping affects subsequent stress reactions in two main ways: First, if a 
person's relationship with the environment is changed by coping actions the 
conditions of psychological stress may also be changed for the better. My 
colleagues and I called this problem-focused coping. If we persuade our neigh­
bor to prevent his tree from dropping leaves on our grass, we overcome the 
original basis of whatever harm or threat their dropping caused us. 
Other coping processes, which we called emotion-focused coping, change 
only the way we attend to or interpret what is happening. A threat that we 
successfully avoid thinking about, even if only temporarily, doesn't bother us. 
Likewise, reappraisal of a threat in nonthreatening terms removes the cogni­
tive basis of the stress reaction. For example, if a person can reinterpret a 
demeaning comment by hislher spouse as the unintended result of personal 
illness or job stress, the appraisal basis for reactive anger will dissipate. Denial 
and distancing are powerful techniques in the control of psychological stress 
because they enable a person to appraise an encounter as more benign. [n 
short, whether the change is in external conditions or in one's construal of 
them, coping influences psychological stress via appraisal; appraisal is always 
the mediator. 
We created a procedure for measuring the coping process in diverse stress­
ful contexts. The Ways of Coping Questionnaire (Folkman & Lazarus 1988b) 
consists of 67 statements about thoughts and actions. An interviewer can use 
these interactively, or a subject can respond to them in a self-administered

PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS AND THE EMOTIONS 9 
procedure. The questionnaire asks whether and to what extent a person had 
used certain thoughts and actions in a particular stressful encounter. 
By asking about thoughts and actions we avoided having our subjects make 
inferences about their coping. Instead, we enabled observers' inferences based 
on a factor analysis yielding eight factor scales, each representing a different 
coping strategy. The procedure was designed to permit repeated measurements 
on the same subjects over time and in different stress contexts (see, e.g., 
Folkman & Lazarus 1985; Folkman et al 1986a; Folkman et al 1986b) . 
A number of replicable findings about coping emerged from this work, the 
most important of which can be summarized as follows: 
1. Coping is complex, and people use most of the basic strategies (factors) of 
coping in every stressful encounter. (Are specific coping strategies tied to specific 
stress contents, or does one strategy follow another in a sort of trial-and-error 
process? The answer is likely both.) 
2. Coping depends on appraisal of whether anything can be done to change the 
situation. If appraisal says something can be done, problem-focused coping 
predominates; if appraisal says nothing can be done, emotion-focused coping 
predominates. Here we have rediscovered the Alcoholics Anomymous epigram, 
that people should try to change the noxious things that can be changed, accept 
those that cannot, and have the wisdom to know the difference. 
3. When the type of stressful encounter is held constant--e.g. work-, health-, or 
family-related stress-women and men show very similar coping pattems, despite 
public predjudices to the contrary. 
4. Some strategies of coping arc more stablc than others across diverse stressful 
encounters while others are linked to particular stressful contexts. For example, 
thinking positively about the situation is relatively stable and depends substan­
tially on personality, whereas seeking social support is unstable and depends 
substantially on the social context. 
5. Coping strategies change from one stage of a complex stressful encounter to 
another. If we lump together the stages in a complex encounter we gain a false 
picture of the coping process. 
6. Coping acts as a powerful mediator of emotional outcomes; positive outcomes 
arc associated with some coping strategies, negative outcomes with others. Our 
data from a nonprospective study suggested this (Folkman & Lazarus 1988a), and 
Bolger (1990) has confirmed it in a prospective study in which the coping process 
was measured independently and before the emotional outcome. 
7. The utility of any coping pattern varies with the type of stressful encounter, 
the type of personality stressed, and the outcome modality studied (e.g. subjective 
well-being, social functioning, or somatic health). What works in one context may 
be counterproductive in another. Thus, when there is nothing to do but wait until 
grades are announced, distancing helps to reduce distress and dysfunction; but 
when effort should be mobilized to study for a future exam, the same strategy leads 
the person to abandon the effort to prepare, with the same lowered distress but a 
later performance disaster (Folkman & Lazarus 1985).

10 LAZARUS 
REGARDING STRESS AS A SUBSET OF THE EMOTIONS 
Psychological stress should be considered part of a larger topic, the emotions. 
This theoretical consolidation, while posing some difficulties, has important 
positive consequences: First, though belonging together, the literature on psy­
chological stress and the literature on emotions have generally been treated as 
separate. Social and biological scientists interested in the emotions are often 
unaware of a relevant stress literature, and vice versa. Because psychological 
stress theory is tantamount to a theory of emotion, and because the two 
literatures share overlapping ideas, the two fields might usefully be conjoined 
as the field of emotion theory. Second, we have already progressed from 
unidimensional 
(activation) 
to 
a multi-dimensional 
(e.g. 
harm, 
threat, 
challenge) concept of stress. In contrast, recognition of 15 or so specific 
emotions instead of the several dimensions of stress greatly increases what we 
can say about an individual's coping and adaptation. Knowing, for example, 
that in a given encounter (or as a consistent pattern across encounters) this 
individual feels angry, anxious, guilty, sad, happy, or hopeful tells us much 
more than knowing merely that he/she is harmed, threatened, or challenged. 
Use of stress as a source of information about an individual's adaptation to 
environmental pressures is extremely limited compared with the use of the full 
array of emotions. 
An explosion of interest in the emotions is evident in all the relevant 
scientific disciplines, each of which looks at emotion from a somewhat differ­
ent perspective and at different levels of analysis. Many conceptually oriented 
books on the topic have been appearing, most of them since 1980, including 
readers by Calhoun & Solomon (1984), Harre (1986), Izard et al (1984), 
Plutchik & Kellerman (1980, 1983, 1986, 1989), and Scherer & Ekman 
(1984), and theoretical monographs by Averill (1982), Frijda (1986), De 
Sousa (1987), Gordon (1987), Izard (1971, 1977), Kemper (1978), Mandler 
(1984), Ortony et al (1988), and Tomkins (1962, 1963), and myself (Lazarus 
1991c). 
Readers will appreciate the historical implications of this modem explosion 
of interest more fully if they also understand that 60 years ago academic 
psychologists seemed ready to abandon the concept of emotion. Allow me to 
backtrack to the period when the stress concept was in growing favor but 
emotion was in the doghouse. In 1933, Meyer made the following arrogant 
and hardly prescient statement about emotion: 
Why introduce into science an unneeded term, such as emotion, when there are 
already scientific items for everything we have to describe? ... I predict: the "will" 
has virtually passed out of our scientific psychology today; the "emotion" is bound 
to do the same. In 1950 American Psychologists will smile at both these terms as 
curiosities of the past. 
When I came on the academic scene in 1948, Duffy (1941a,b; 1960) was

PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS AND THE EMOTIONS 11 
cause it denoted "all of life," that is, the ordinary adaptational activities by 
means of which an organism maintained its internal equilibrium in the face of 
threatened disruption from internal and external pressures. 
Adaptational responses, she said, have direction, are reactions to relation­
ships, and invoke energy mobilization. Therefore, we should abandon the 
concept of emotion and substitute activation in its place. Was there any psy­
chologically significant difference between a person running to his/her house 
on a whim and a person, seeing a fire, running the same way in a panic? Her 
answer was no. She wrote (1941a:287-88), for example, that 
all behavior is motivated. Without motivation there is no activity ... . The 
responses called "emotional" do not appear to follow different principles of action 
from other adjustive responses of the individual. Changes in internal or external 
conditions, or in the interpretation of these conditions, always result in internal 
accommodations. The responses made are specifically adjustive to the situation 
and are not subject to classification into such categories as "emotional" and 
"non-emotional." ... All responses-not merely "emotional" responses-are 
adjustive reactions attempting to adapt the organism to the demands of the 
situation. The energy level of response varies with the requirements of the situation 
as interpreted by the individual. Diffuse internal changes (especially in the viscera) 
are involved in the production of these changes in energy level. But continuous 
visceral activity, with accompanying changes in energy level, is a function of life 
itself, not merely a function of a particular condition called "emotion." 
At the time, Duffy's theme seemed reasonable and sound to me, though I 
now reject her position. Those, such as I, who study the psychological process 
of emotion contend that there is a world of difference between a non-emo­
tional and an emotional event. Although there are behavioral and physiologi­
cal overlaps, the ways whim-motivated and alarm-motivated actions are 
organized psychologically are quite different. One's house being on fire elicits 
motives, beliefs, appraisals, and coping processes different from those elicited 
in whimsy, and some emotion theorists would wager that panic has its own 
special physiological response pattern. Once aroused, emotion is a system of 
its own. Duffy's question and response are reminiscent of Skinner's claim that 
from a behaviorist's point of view there is no difference between the tears of 
eye irritation and the tears of emotional distress. 
Why did the stress concept survive and flourish in an epistemological 
climate so hostile to the emotions? The initial noncognitive, nonmediational, 
S-R view of psychological stress was suggested by Hooke's engineering anal­
ysis. This view was carried over into analyses of stress prior to the so-called 
cognitive revolution. A good example of the carryover was the frequent use in 
the 1960s and 1970s of life events lists for measuring stress, which empha­
sized such objective environmental changes as death of a spouse, divorce, and 
loss of a job as stressors. However, by the 1970s much of North American 
psychology had begun to change and was now receptive-though still some-

what ambivalently-to a cognitive mediational approach to stress and the 
emotions. 
This historical account does not suggest that the study of stress is no longer 
useful. Rather, the concept of emotion includes that of stress, and both are 
subject to appraisal and coping theory. As a topic, stress is more limited in 
scope and depth than the emotions, as I try to show below. 
A COGNITIVE-MOTIVATIONAL-RELATIONAL THEORY 
OF EMOTION 
The topic of the emotions provides many more categories of reaction than 
does that of stress, as many as there are emotions that we are willing to 
acknowledge and study (itself a controversial subject). I believe that we can 
identify 15 different emotions, more or less (Lazarus 1991b,c). There are 
roughly 9 so-called negative emotions: anger, fright, anxiety, guilt, shame, 
sadness, envy, jealousy, and disgust, each a product of a different set of 
troubled conditions of living, and each involving different harms or threats. 
And there are roughly 4 positive emotions: happiness, pride, relief, and love. 
To this list we probably could add three more whose valence is equivocal or 
mixed: hope, compassion, and gratitude. (Below I suggest the "core" relational 
themes for each of these emotions). 
What gives this multiplicity of emotions great analytic power is that each 
emotion arises from a different plot or story about relationships between a 
person and the environment; feeling angry has its own special scenario, and so 
does feeling anxious, guilty, ashamed, sad, proud, and so forth. Notice that this 
way of thinking complicates but enriches the job of understanding and predict­
ing. If it is true that each emotion is brought about by a different appraisal of 
the personal significance of an adaptational encounter, then we learn different 
adaptationally relevant things from each about what is happening and about 
the psychological characteristics of the person who is reacting. 
Emotion theorists and researchers must now tackle many issues-too many 
to examine adequately here. I spend the remainder of this essay on the one that 
has powered much of my research, namely, the achievement of relational 
meaning through the process of appraisal. This, as I said, is the fundamental 
puzzle for students of both psychological stress and the emotions. Although I 
have addressed the problem recently (Lazarus 1991a-c), the proposed solu­
tions are still fluid and a number of other emotion researchers are also strug­
gling to resolve it. 
If one takes the position, as I do, that the particular emotion experienced 
depends on one's thoughts about an encounter, then these thoughts can most 
fruitfully be conceptualized at two related but different levels of abstraction, 
one molar, the other molecular. I begin with the molar level.

Relational Meaning: Core Relational Themes 
I said above, without explanation, that emotions are always a response to 
relational meaning. The relational meaning of an encounter is a person's sense 
of the harms and benefits in a particular person-environment relationship. To 
speak of harms and benefits is to alludc to motivational as well as cognitive 
processes; hence the complex name of the theory, which includes the terms 
cognitive, motivational, and relational. 
Personality variables and those that characterize the environment come 
together in the appraisal of relational meaning. An emotion is aroused not just 
by an environmental demand, constraint, or resource but by their juxtaposition 
with a person's motives and beliefs. The process of appraisal negotiates be­
tween and integrates these two sets of variables by indicating the significance 
of what is happening for a person's well-being. This is an extension of the 
cognitive mediational principle in psychological stress theory-namely, that 
what causes the stress reaction is not the environmental "stressor" alone but 
also its significance as appraised by the person who encounters it. 
Although one can decompose molar relational meaning into separate, mo­
lecular personality and environmental variables (e.g. as hostile actions by 
another or a goal one is striving for), relational meaning results from a higher 
or more synthetic level of analysis. At that level the separate variables are lost 
in favor of a new relational concept--e.g. feeling demeaned, sensing an uncer­
tain threat, feeling failure to live up to an ego-ideal, feeling attainment of what 
one wants, sensing enhancement of one's self, or suffering an irrevocable loss. 
Our penchant for reductive analysis in psychology often leaves us without the 
ability to see how the separate variables are synthesized into molar ones. (For

a classic discussion of the difference between reductive analysis and synthesis 
or transaction, see Dewey & Bentley 1949; see Lazarus & Launier 1978 for 
another). 
Two spouses, A and B, construct different meanings from the same argu­
mentative encounter. For A, the relational meaning of what is happening is 
that he/she has been demeaned or slighted; this meaning motivates a desire to 
repair the wounded self-esteem. For B, on the other hand, the argument's 
relational meaning is that the marital relationship itself has been threatened. 
The emotion experienced by B is anger, by A anxiety. 
If we would demonstrate that relational meaning is the cognitive founda­
tion of emotion, we must define and measure this meaning-address it empiri­
cally. I call the core relational theme the relational meaning in each emotion 
(Lazarus 1991b,c). Each emotion involves a different core relational theme. In 
Table 1 I suggest core relational themes for the emotions discussed above. 
The Separate Appraisal Components 
A number of different but overlapping proposals have been advanced about 
the molecular appraisal components underlying each emotion-see, for exam­
ple, Frijda (1986), Lazarus (1991c), Reisenzein & Hofmann (1990), Roseman 
(1984, 1991), Scherer (1984), Smith & Ellsworth (1985, 1987), and Weiner 
(1986)-and these earlier efforts have been reviewed by Lazarus & Smith 
(1988) and Smith & Lazarus (1990), Smith & Ellsworth (1985), and others. 
Although their language often differs, these proposals share a number of 
appraisal components, which suggests the beginnings of a common theoretical 
ground. Most of these systems assume that one key appraisal component is 
motivational; to have an emotion requires an active goal in an encounter; if no 
goal is at stake there can be no emotion. Most also assume that the valence of 
an emotion depends on whether the conditions of the encounter are viewed as 
favorable to goal attainment (thereby begetting a positive emotion) or unfavor­
able (thereby begetting a negative emotion). In most proposals, too, assign­
ment of responsibility is factored into certain emotions-that is, whether a 
harm or benefit is attributed to the self or another. The accountability of others 
is an important component in the appraisal leading to anger, while self-ac­
countability is important in pride, guilt, and shame. 
In my treatment of the appraisal pattern for anger, I have adopted a some­
what controversial position. I regard anger as resulting from an individual's 
appraisal of injury to self-esteem. Blame is a key appraisal component of 
anger. The angry person locates responsibility in an external agent-i.e. de­
cides that the person who caused the injury could have refrained from doing 
so. In contrast with the traditional frustration-aggression hypothesis (cf 
Berkowitz 1989), I suggest that a person who could not have acted otherwise 
is not blameworthy, and hence is not the object of anger. There is no malevo­
lence or slight in such a situation, and if there is anger it will be directed

PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS AND THE EMOTIONS 15 
elsewhere on the basis of complex social attributions. Research addressing the 
role of imputed intentions in the generation of anger has not yet adequately 
resolved the theoretical question. 
Three additional points should be made about appraisal and relational 
meaning. First, the two levels of analysis, core relational themes and individ­
ual appraisal components, are complementary ways of conceptualizing and 
assessing the particular relational meaning in an emotion. One is synthetic and 
molar, the other analytic and molecular. A single appraisal component pro­
vides only part of this meaning. In the case of anger, for example, the rela­
tional meaning cannot be determined from a sense of frustration alone. The 
analyst has to observe a pattern composed of several appraisal components. 
Not only does the subject have to feel thwarted, hislher self-esteem has to have 
been demeaned, responsibility has to have been attributed, and the responsible 
person has to have been presumed in control of hislher actions. In short, this 
analysis can synthesize the complex relational meaning (a demeaning offense 
against me or mine) only after at least four appraisal decisions have been 
distinguished (out of a possible total of six; see Lazarus 1991c). 
Second, disagreements about the details of the appraisal pattern for each 
emotion should not obscure the considerable agreement about the appraisal 
pattern required for most emotions, based on a long history of observation and 
speculation. The current ferment in appraisal theory and research reflects 
serious attempts to evaluate some of the disagreements empirically. 
Third, among appraisal theorists only Scherer (1984) regards the process of 
appraising as a sequential search of each appraisal question, thereby implying 
a conscious and deliberate process of decision-making. Although it conflicts 
with traditional usage among cognitive psychologists, a view of the evaluative 
process of appraisal as often nonvolitional and unconscious may be emerging. 
There is a resurgence of interest in a way of achieving meaning that is not 
analytic and distant, but immediate and personal. Concepts such as being-in­
the-situation (Heidegger; see Guignon 1984; Taylor 1985), embodied intelli­
gence (Merleau-Ponty 1962), tacit knowledge (Polanyi 1966), and resonance 
(Shepard 1984; see also Trevarthen 1979 on intersubjectivity) illustrate this 
way of thinking. We sense things about our relationship to the environment 
without being able to verbalize them. Our emotions often reflect this ephem­
eral kind of knowing and evaluating (Lazarus & Smith 1988), as well as the 
more deliberate and analytic processes studied in modem cognitive psychol­
ogy (see, for example, Lazarus 1991a; and Varela et aI1991). 
Despite current notions that emotions and reason are separate and opposing 
functions and that people are inherently irrational, I now believe that the 
emotions have an implacable logic. The task of theory is to determine that 
logic for each emotion. One may reason poorly and attain a sound conclusion; 
or one may reason well, and come to an unsound conclusion. These forms of 
irrationality, if you will, are not the same. Although intense emotions may

16 LAZARUS 
impair or disrupt reasoning, I believe that most of the time people are rational, 
given their goals and belief premises. 
What could be more logical than the principle that if our goals are thwarted 
we react with a negative emotion, or that if we are making satisfactory prog­
ress toward a goal we react with positive emotion? This reaction may not 
always be wise, but there is nothing irrational about it. What is more logical 
than the principle that emotions result from how we evaluate the significance 
of events to our well-being? It may be foolish to want certain things, or to 
believe certain things, but it is not illogical to emote on the basis of how we 
are faring in attaining these goals. 
Coping and Emotion 
Coping shapes emotion, as it does psychological stress, by influencing the 
person-environment relationship and how it is appraised. Coping involves 
both (a) attempts to change the person-environment realities behind negative 
emotions (problem-focused coping) and (b) attempts to change either what is 
attended to or how it is appraised (emotion-focused coping). However, inclu­
sion of emotion in the study of coping provides a much richer perspective. One 
might consider, for example, the sociocultural and intrapsychic implications of 
having reacted with one or another of the 15 or so emotions. Thus if one 
expresses anger in a context where anger is rejected by the community, the 
emotion itself must be coped with---e.g. by inhibition or denial. 
With the burgeoning of interest in the emotions has come the realization 
that coping theory must become more concerned than formerly with the moti­
vational implications of person-environment relationships, which underlie the 
different emotions. The point can be illustrated by reference to recent research 
by Laux & Weber (1991), who have been studying how marital partners cope 
both with angry interchanges and with joint threats that produce anxiety. 
Two main patterns have been observed: First, the coping manifested by 
both parties in an argument is different from that in an anxiety encounter. 
During an encounter involving anger, more effort is expended in repairing 
wounded self-esteem than is expended in an anxiety encounter. In anger, such 
efforts of reparation include attacking the other, escalating anger, defending 
the self, and posturing. In anxiety encounters, more efforts are made to reas­
sure the other and to preserve the relationship. 
Second, even within an anger encounter, the way a marital partner copes 
differs with hislher differing general goals and situational intentions. If the 
partner is preoccupied with preserving a relationship threatened by anger, 
anger escalation is avoided. The partner threatened by damage to the relation­
ship from anger may suppress and conceal hislher anger. I expect this partner 
would also find excuses not to take offense (emotion-focused coping). On the 
other hand, the partner whose intention is to repair a wounded self-esteem is 
more apt to deliver comeuppance. We will understand the coping process

better when we understand the general goals and situational intentions, as well 
as the emotions, of the parties in encounters. 
FINAL THOUGHTS 
The philosophical history of the emotions has been essentially cognitive from 
ancient times to the present. Aristotle, who lived in the 4th century Be. might 
be called the first cognitive theuri÷t uf the emotions, writing in Rhetoric 
( 1941:1 380) that "Anger may be defined as a belief that we, or our friends, 
have been unfairly slighted, which causes in us both painful feelings and a 
desire or impulse for revenge." This statement contains the basics of an ap­
praisal theory-for example, in its connecting a belief. desire, or motivation to 
an impulse for revenge (what today is often called an action tendency). With 
respect to how anger is aroused, Aristotle asks us to consider "(1) what the 
state of mind of angry people is, (2) who the people are with whom they 
usually get angry, and (3) on what grounds they get angry with them. It is not 
enough to know one or even two of these points; unless we know all three, we 
shall be unable to arouse anger in anyone. The same is true of the other 
emotions." 
Here Aristotle speaks of the state of mind, and of a cognitively mediated 
provocation to anger. He seems to be pointing the analysis of emotion toward 
the researchable conditions behind the arousal of emotions. Quite modern 
sounding, it seems to me. 
Averill's (1982) treatment of historical teachings about anger. particularly 
his description of the views of Seneca, Lactantius, Aquinas, and Descartes, 
leaves little doubt that cognitive mediation of the emotions has been a preemi­
nent concept. And lest the reader think that ancient or medieval cognitive-mo­
tivational-relational views went into hiding until recently, I quote G. C. 
Robertson (1877:413), a 19th-century English philosopher who wrote-in a 
fashion reminiscent of Rashomon-the following: 
Four persons of much the same age and temperament are travelling in the same 
vehicle. At a particular stopping-place it is intimated to them that a certain person 
has just died suddenly and unexpectedly. One of the company looks perfectly 
stolid. A second comprehends what has taken place. but is in no way affected. The 
third looks and evidently feels sad. The fourth is overwhelmed with grief which 
finds expression in tears, sobs. and exclamations. Whence the difference of the 
four individuals before us? In one respect they are all alike: an announcement has 
bcen made to them. The first is a foreigner. and has not understood the commu­
nication. The second has never met with the deceased, and could have no special 
regard for him. The third had often met with him in social intercourse and business 
transactions, and been led to cherish a great esteem for him. The fourth was the 
brother of the departed, and was bound to him by native affection and a thousand 
ties earlier and later. From such a case we may notice that in order to [experience 
an emotion] there is need first of some understanding or apprehension; the 
foreigner had no feeling because he had no idea or belief. We may observe further

that there must secondly be an affection of some kind; for the stranger was not 
interested in the occurrence. The emotion flows forth from a well, and is strong 
in proportion to the waters; is stronger in the brother than in the friend. It is evident, 
thirdly, that the persons affected are in a moved or excited state. A fourth 
peculiarity has appeared in the sadness of the countenance and the agitations of 
the bodily frame. Four elements have thus come forth to view. 
The attempt to abandon emotion as a topic for scientific study-either by 
subsuming it within other concepts or by arguing that, being nonmaterial, 
emotion requires no explanation-seems to me to have been an historical 
aberration. This aberration, in the form of radical behaviorism, occurred dur­
ing the early development of academic psychology, which was-except in 
North America-overly concerned with being ultrascientific in the image of 
the natural sciences. It was not a reflection of the main lines of thought that 
had existed for centuries and that have been restored in the last few decades 
(see also Reisenzein & Schonpflug 1992 for an account of Stumpf's late 
19th-century cognitive theory of emotion, which has been given virtually no 
previous attention). 
I entered academic psychology at the height of this movement which, as 
Deese (1985:31) put it, was dedicated to "the abolition of mind." Psychology 
was separated from the philosophy departments of modem Western European 
and North American universities, within which it had traditionally been in­
cluded, and psychologists were enjoined (this I vividly remember) to avoid 
"armchair" speculation in the interests of being empirical scientists. Only in 
recent years have most psychologists once again been willing to see value in 
philosphical analyses, to take on large-scale theory, to take seriously observa­
tions that are not obtained through laboratory experiment, to engage problems 
of subjective meaning, and to avoid the sterile scientism of the recent past. 
The political and social changes my generation has lived through have been 
profound-the Great Depression, World War II, the advent of rockets, jet 
planes, atomic energy, and television. Today we observe with awe the pro­
found political changes in Eastern Europe after the collapse of the Soviet 
Empire, as well as tranformations in Asia and the Middle East. And we are 
correctly told that even the near future is impossible to predict with confi­
dence. 
We have lived through similar monumental changes in the way psychology 
and its cognate social sciences go about their scientific business. These 
changes have been no less extraordinary than the political and social ones. 
They are manifest in the problems being studied and the rnindset for studying 
them. I have tried to reflect them in a small way in my discussion of stress and 
the emotions. Research and theory on the emotions are beneficiaries of this 
changing epistemology. Though fads and fashions in psychology have waxed 
and waned rapidly in the recent past, I believe the emotions are too central to 
human adaptation for the current enthusiasm to disappear soon. I would cer­
tainly like to be around to know.
