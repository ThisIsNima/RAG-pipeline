Lactic acid-producing bacteria are associated with various plant
and animal niches and play a key role in the production of
fermented foods and beverages. We report nine genome se-
quences representing the phylogenetic and functional diversity of
these bacteria. The small genomes of lactic acid bacteria encode a
broad repertoire of transporters for efﬁcient carbon and nitrogen
acquisition from the nutritionally rich environments they inhabit
and reﬂect a limited range of biosynthetic capabilities that indicate
both prototrophic and auxotrophic strains. Phylogenetic analyses,
comparison of gene content across the group, and reconstruction
of ancestral gene sets indicate a combination of extensive gene
loss and key gene acquisitions via horizontal gene transfer during
the coevolution of lactic acid bacteria with their habitats.
evolutionary genomics  fermentation
L
actic acid bacteria (LAB) are historically defined as a group
of microaerophilic, Gram-positive organisms that ferment
hexose sugars to produce primarily lactic acid. This functional
classification includes a variety of industrially important genera,
including Lactococcus, Enterococcus, Oenococcus, Pediococcus,
Streptococcus, Leuconostoc, and Lactobacillus species. The seem-
ingly simplistic metabolism of LAB has been exploited through-
out history for the preservation of foods and beverages in nearly
all societies dating back to the origins of agriculture (1). Do-
mestication of LAB strains passed down through various culi-
nary traditions and continuous passage on food stuffs has
resulted in modern-day cultures able to carry out these fermen-
tations. Today, LAB play a prominent role in the world food
supply, performing the main bioconversions in fermented dairy
products, meats, and vegetables. LAB also are critical for the
production of wine, coffee, silage, cocoa, sourdough, and nu-
merous indigenous food fermentations (2).
LAB species are indigenous to food-related habitats, including
plant (fruits, vegetables, and cereal grains) and milk environ-
ments. In addition, LAB are naturally associated with the
mucosal surfaces of animals, e.g., small intestine, colon, and
vagina. Isolates of the same species often are obtained from
plant, dairy, and animal habitats, implying wide distribution and
specialized adaptation to these diverse environments. LAB
species employ two pathways to metabolize hexose: a homofer-
mentative pathway in which lactic acid is the primary product
and a heterofermentative pathway in which lactic acid, CO2,
acetic acid, andor ethanol are produced (3).
Complete genome sequences have been published for eight
fermentative and commensal LAB species: Lactococcus lactis,
Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus johnsonii, Lactobacillus
acidophilus, Lactobacillus sakei, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lacto-
bacillus salivarius, and Streptococcus thermophilus (4–11). This
study examines nine other LAB genomes representing the
phylogenetic and functional diversity of lactic acid-producing
microorganisms. The LAB have small genomes encoding a range
of biosynthetic capabilities that reflect both prototrophic and
auxotrophic characters. Phylogenetic analyses, comparison of
genomic content across the group, and reconstruction of ances-
tral gene sets reveal a combination of gene loss and gain during
the coevolution of LAB with animals and the foods they
consumed.
Results and Discussion
General Features of the LAB Genomes. The major features of the
sequenced LAB genomes are summarized in Table 1, which is
published as supporting information on the PNAS web site. The
number of predicted protein-coding genes in the LAB differs
from 1,700 to 2,800. Given the close phylogenetic relation-
ship of these organisms, such a difference suggests substantial
gene loss andor gain in their evolution. In addition, all LAB
genomes harbor pseudogenes. Strikingly, the number of pseu-
dogenes differs by an order of magnitude, from 20 in Leu-
conostoc mesenteroides and Pediococcus pentosaceus to 200 in
S. thermophilus (5) and Lactobacillus delbrueckii, indicating an
active, ongoing process of genome degeneration. The LAB also
differ in the number of rRNA operons, from two in Oenococcus
oeni to nine in Lb. delbrueckii, which correlates with the number
of tRNA genes (Table 1) and may reflect differences in the
ecological competitiveness (e.g., capacity for rapid growth and
production of lactic acid) between these bacteria (12, 13). All

LAB genomes contained transposons, ranging from 0.2% of
the genome in Lactobacillus gasseri to nearly 5% in Lc. lactis ssp.
cremoris. Many LAB harbor plasmids, some of which are essen-
tial for growth in specific environments and carry genes for
metabolic pathways, membrane transport, and bacteriocin pro-
duction (14). The contribution of plasmid-encoded genes in the
LAB ranges from 0% to 4.8% of total gene content (Table 1).
Phylogenetic Analysis and Impact of Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT)
on LAB Evolution. The LAB analyzed here belong to the phylum
Firmicutes, class Bacilli and order Lactobacillales, a sister taxon
to Firmicutes, Bacilli, and Bacillales. Classification of Lactoba-
cillales remains an unresolved issue in particular because phe-
notypic classification, which is traditionally based on the type of
fermentation, does not match the rRNA-based phylogeny (15).
Whole-genome DNA and DNA–RNA hybridization and GC
content studies led to the delineation of three closely related
lineages of Lactobacillales (16): the Leuconostoc group (Le.
mesenteroides and O. oeni), the Lactobacillus casei–Pediococcus
group (Lb. plantarum, Lb. casei, P. pentosaceus, and Lactobacil-
lus brevis), and the Lb. delbrueckii group (Lb. delbrueckii, Lb.
gasseri, and Lb. johnsonii) (15); streptococci (S. thermophilus)
and lactococci (Lc. lactis ssp. lactis and Lc. lactis ssp. cremoris)
formed a separate branch (16).
The availability of complete genomes for all major branches of
Lactobacillales enables a more definitive analysis of their evo-
lutionary relationships. We constructed phylogenetic trees from
concatenated protein sequences, an approach shown to improve
the resolution and increase robustness of phylogenetic analyses
(17). We supplemented the ribosomal protein data set (Fig. 1)
with concatenated RNA polymerase subunits (Fig. 4, which is
published as supporting information on the PNAS web site),
which also undergo little horizontal transfer. Both trees, con-
structed with a variety of methods, display the same topology
with strongly supported internal branches. The streptococci–
lactococci branch is basal in the Lactobacillales tree, and the
Pediococcus group is a sister to the Leuconostoc group within the
Lactobacillus clade. Thus, the Lactobacillus genus appears to be
paraphyletic with respect to the Pediococcus–Leuconostoc group.
Lactobacillus casei is confidently placed at the base of the Lb.
delbrueckii group, which contradicts the previous classifications
(16, 18).
A molecular clock test (19) showed a high heterogeneity of
evolutionary rates within Lactobacillales. Most of the root-to-tip
distances are significantly unequal to the mean tree height; the
previously reported (20) accelerated evolution of the Leuconos-
toc group (by a factor of 1.7–1.9 relative to the sister Pediococcus
group) was especially prominent.
The strength of purifying selection acting on Lactobacillales
species can be estimated by using two closely related pairs of
genomes: Lb. gasseriLb. johnsonii and Lc. lactisLc. cremoris.
Synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates were esti-
mated from concatenated coding sequence alignments of 443
orthologous genes (142,031 codons). The dSdN (distance at
synonymous sitesdistance at nonsynonymous sites) ratio was
38.5  0.5 for the Lb. gasseriLb. johnsonii pair and 29.8  0.4
for Lc. lactisLc. cremoris pair, showing unusually strong evo-
lutionary pressure as compared with Proteobacteria, which has a
characteristic dSdN ratio of 5–10 (21). This is likely to reflect
the large effective population size andor high mutation rate of
the Lactobacillales species because the intensity of purifying
selection is known to be proportional to these quantities (22).
Clusters of Orthologous Genes in Lactobacillales. Robust identifica-
tion of sets of orthologs (genes derived from the same ancestral
gene) is a prerequisite for informative evolutionary–genomic
analysis of any group of organisms. By using the computational
procedure described previously (23), we constructed Lactoba-
cillales-specific clusters of orthologous genes [LaCOGs (abbre-
viated COGs if clusters of orthologous genes are not Lactoba-
cillales-specific)] for the Lactobacillales-specific set (Table 2,
which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web
site) from proteins encoded in 12 sequenced Lactobacillales
genomes that were available at the time of this analysis. Many
COGs include paralogous genes that evolved via duplications at
different stages of evolution. The construction of orthologous
clusters for a compact taxon, such as the Lactobacillales, results
in much finer granularity, with a greater fraction of clusters
containing a single member from all or most of the analyzed
species. Altogether, 3,199 LaCOGs, which included from 2
species to all 12 species, were identified. On average, LaCOGs
covered 86% of the genome (Fig. 2); 1,133 (35%) LaCOGs
showed a one-to-one correspondence with the general COG set;
1,359 (43%) LaCOGs corresponded to 390 COGs that have been
split into two or more paralogous groups. The remaining 707
(22%) LaCOGs have no counterparts in the general COG set
(24); of these, 338 (11%) were shared with one or more
non-Lactobacillales bacterial genomes among those reported
recently and not yet included in the COGs, and 369 (11%)
appeared to be specific to the Lactobacillales. Thus, the LaCOGs
are a powerful resource for genome annotation and evolutionary
analysis of Lactobacillales (for details, see Table 2).
The conserved core of genes present in all 12 species analyzed
in the Lactobacillales genomes (Table 2) consists of 567 LaCOGs
(18%). Functional distribution of the LaCOGs in this core shows
that the majority encode components of the information-
processing systems (translation, transcription, and replication).
However, the core also includes 41 uncharacterized genes and 50
genes with only a general prediction of biochemical activity.
Because these genes are conserved throughout Lactobacillales, it
is likely that they have essential functions, at least within this
group. Furthermore, two core genes have no detectable or-
thologs outside lactobacilli. One of these unique genomic mark-
ers of Lactobacillales contains a LysM (peptidoglycan-binding)
domain (LaCOG01826). In several lactobacilli, this gene is
located next to the genes for ribosomal proteins and cytidylate
kinase and might be coregulated with these housekeeping genes.
The second genomic marker, the highly conserved La-
COG01237, contains no characterized domains. However, this
gene is located in a conserved genomic neighborhood encoding
two enzymes implicated in 4-thiouridine modification of tRNA
[(5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridylate) methyltransferase and

a predicted sulfurase] (LaCOG00578 and LaCOG01188; see
Table 2), suggesting a role of LaCOG01237 proteins in specific
modulation of this essential modification (25).
Local Molecular Clock and HGT. We tested the consistency of a local
molecular clock in individual LaCOGs with a technique devel-
oped recently (26). A matrix of interspecies distances for each
LaCOG was compared with the matrix of baseline distances
obtained from the concatenated alignment of ribosomal pro-
teins. If a COG evolves in a clock-like manner relative to the
evolution of ribosomal proteins, a linear dependence between
the two matrices is observed. At least 25% of the LaCOGs
showed strong deviations from the linear dependence, suggest-
ing a high level of HGT andor major local accelerations of
evolution (Fig. 5, which is published as supporting information
on the PNAS web site). Several functional groups of genes show
statistically significant differences in their propensity to violate
the local molecular clock (Table 3, which is published as sup-
porting information on the PNAS web site). Of particular
interest is the substantially elevated level of such violations
among genes involved in sugar metabolism, including key en-
zymes, such as phosphoketolase, transketolase, and various
components of phosphotransferase systems (Table 4, which is
published as supporting information on the PNAS web site).
HGT via bacteriophage-mediated or conjugative mechanisms
has been extensively documented in the Lactobacillales and is a
prominent process for niche-specific adaptation in the lactococci
(27). Noteworthy is the potential for such transfer in Lc. lactis
ssp. cremoris SK11 that harbors a conjugative plasmid (pLAC3)
and several additional plasmids encoding genes related to
growth in milk (28).
Reconstruction of Gene Gain and Loss in the Evolution of Lactobacil-
lales. We used a version of the weighted parsimony algorithm
(29) to reconstruct the events that occurred during the evolution
of this group after its divergence from the common ancestor of
all Bacilli (see Materials and Methods). This reconstruction
suggests that the common ancestor of Lactobacillales had at least
2,100–2,200 genes, losing 600–1,200 genes (25–30%) and
gaining 100 genes compared with the ancestor of all Bacilli, for
which the genome size of 2,700–3,700 genes is predicted (Fig.
3). Thus, the origin of Lactobacillales involved extensive loss of
ancestral genes (Table 5, which is published as supporting
information on the PNAS web site). Many of the changes
mapped to this stage of evolution seem to be related to the
transition to life in a nutritionally rich medium. Thus, a number
of genes for biosynthesis of cofactors were lost; conversely, a
variety of peptidases were acquired, apparently via HGT. The
Lactobacillales ancestor was likely a microaerophile or an anaer-
obe, which is reflected in the loss of hemecopper-type cyto-
chromequinol oxidase-related genes and catalase, characteris-
tic enzymes of aerobic bacteria. In addition, several probable
nonorthologous gene displacements via HGT were identified
(Table 5). Furthermore, Lactobacillales (or the common ances-
tor of Bacilli) might have acquired the complete mevalonate
pathway via HGT, possibly from an archaeal source (directly or
through a bacterial intermediate). This pathway displaced the
ancestral bacterial deoxyxylulose pathway of isoprenoid biosyn-
thesis. The acquisition of the mevalonate pathway tree with a
subsequent duplication of the mevalonate kinase gene is sup-
ported by the specific organization of the genes for four enzymes
of this pathway [mevalonate and phosphomevalonate kinases,
mevalonate pyrophosphate decarboxylase, and isopentenyl-
diphosphate -isomerase (LaCOGs 296, 298, 297, and 299,
respectively)] in a single operon that is conserved in most
Lactobacillales genomes.
In addition to the metabolic reduction, a major part of the
gene loss in the common ancestor of Lactobacillales were
sporulation-related functions encoded by the common ancestor
of Bacilli. Despite the absence of genes for sporulation, catalase,
and other key enzymes of oxidative stress response (e.g., super-
oxide dismutase) in 8 of the 12 genomes analyzed here (possibly
multiple losses), at least some lactobacilli show enhanced stress
resistance. This resistance is demonstrated by the increased
recovery of live lactobacilli from vacuum-dried and irradiated
food (30) by comparison to staphylococcal and Salmonella

species. This resistance may be mediated in part by the low
content of iron, a potent oxidant, which is accompanied by
accumulation of manganese, a powerful antioxidant (31–33).
Additional protection is likely to be provided by other antioxi-
dants, including glutathione and -glutamylcysteine. Several
Lactobacillus species encode a bifunctional glutathione syn-
thetase (GshAB), whereas others have only -glutamylcysteine
synthetase (GshA) (LaCOG01892). However, even lactococci
that cannot synthesize glutathione have been shown to accumu-
late it, apparently via transport from the environment (34).
Loss of ancestral genes seems to be the prevailing trend in the
evolution of Lactobacillales, as in other bacteria (35). Like all
other bacterial lineages (36), lactobacilli also have a significant
number of expanded gene families that evolved either by lineage-
specific gene duplication or by acquisition of paralogous genes
via HGT (37). A closer examination of these families indicates
that adaptation to growth in nutrient-rich environments was the
major driving force behind the fixation of duplications during the
evolution of the Lactobacillales (Table 6, which is published as
supporting information on the PNAS web site). An interesting
case of ancient gene acquisition is the second enolase, which is
characteristic of the Lactobacillales. All other bacteria have a
single copy of this nearly ubiquitous glycolytic enzyme, but most
of the Lactobacillales have two (with some differential gene loss).
Phylogenetic analysis shows that one of these copies is the
ancestral version in Gram-positive bacteria, whereas the other
copy had been acquired by the ancestor of the Lactobacillales
from a different bacterial lineage, most likely, Actinobacteria.
The evolution rate of both enolases seems to be increased in the
Lactobacillales branches of the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 6, which
is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site).
It has been shown that both enolases of Lc. lactis ssp. lactis have
enzymatic activity (38); however, their specific physiological
functions remain unknown. Many other genes for proteins
involved in sugar metabolism and transport were duplicated
early in the evolution of the Lactobacillales, including phos-
phoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase systems, -galactosidase,
GpmB family sugar phosphatases, galactose mutarotase, and
L-lactate dehydrogenases of two distinct classes. In addition to
the apparent acquisition of new peptidases via HGT, duplica-
tions of several lineage-specific genes for these enzymes and for
amino acid transporters were detected. Several paralogous ex-
pansions include genes for putative proteins related to those
involved in antibiotic resistance in other bacteria, such as
-lactamases and penicillin V acylase. However, most LAB
species analyzed here have been shown to be sensitive to
common antibiotics and, after centuries of consumption by
humans, have been, accordingly, ‘‘generally recognized as safe’’
(39, 40). Conceivably, the homologs of antibiotic-resistance
genes are involved in normal cell-wall biosynthesis in the Lac-
tobacillales. In the same context, expansion of a distinct family of
tyrosineserine phosphatases, which are often localized in the
same operon with a serinethreonine protein kinase fused to
several -lactam-binding domains, is likely to be important for
the regulation of cell-wall biosynthesis (41). Furthermore, Lac-
tobacillales encode a paralog of class II lysyl-tRNA synthetase,
which is fused to a membrane-associated domain (COG2898)
implicated in oxacillin-like antibiotic resistance (42) and is
probably involved in cell-wall biosynthesis.
The subsequent evolution of the Lactobacillales reveals ancestral
gene loss and metabolic simplification but also a considerable
number of lineage-specific duplications and acquisitions of unique
genes. Numerous parallel gene losses, especially of genes coding for
biosynthetic enzymes, were detected in the major branches of
Lactobacillales, which presumably reflects similar environmental
pressures. For instance, genes for serine and glycine biosynthesis
were lost in the common ancestor of Lactobacillaceae and Leu-
conostocaceae; genes for biosynthesis of arginine and aromatic
amino acids were lost independently in Lb. brevis, P. pentosaceus, O.
oeni, and the Lb. casei–Lb. delbrueckii group; and several fatty-
acid-biosynthesis genes were lost in the Lb. gasseri and Lb. johnsonii
branch (Table 2). Lineage-specific gene loss was extensive in the
evolution of all lineages of Lactobacillales, but several species were
especially notable ‘‘losers.’’ In particular, S. thermophilus not only
lost numerous genes but also exhibited many fresh pseudogenes,
suggesting an active and ongoing process of genome decay, similarly
reported for two different strains of the same species (5). Moreover,
substantial gene loss (368 genes according to the present recon-
struction) also occurred at the base of the streptococci–lactococci
branch (including several genes involved in cell division that are
conserved in most bacteria, such as crcB, mreB, mreC, and MinD).
Other lineages particularly prone to gene loss are P. pentosaceus
(487 genes lost) and the Leuconostoc and Oenococcus branch, with
381 genes lost at the base of the branch and considerable additional
loss in each species. Substantial gene loss also occurred during the
evolution of the Lb. delbrueckii group (Lb. delbrueckii, Lb. gasseri,
and Lb. johnsonii), leading to additional genome reduction in Lb.
gasseri and Lb. johnsonii (Fig. 3). In the species with larger genomes,
such as Lb. plantarum and Lb. casei, the loss of ancestral genes was
counterbalanced by the emergence of many new genes via dupli-
cation and HGT (Fig. 3).
Comparison of the number of genes lost or gained on a particular
tree branch and the length of the corresponding branch reveals a
pattern similar to that described previously for Proteobacteria (43).
The number of gene losses (even when normalized by the size of the
ancestral genome) strongly and significantly correlates with the
branch length determined from sequence divergence (R  0.68;
P  5  104), whereas the number of gene gains (again, regardless
of normalization) does not show such a correlation (R  0.16; P 
0.1). The clock-like behavior of gene loss is consistent with a large
number of small-scale events, which are randomly distributed along
the evolutionary path. This pattern suggests evolution under puri-
fying selection. In contrast, the lack of such correlation for gene gain
appears to involve relatively large batches of genes acquired at a
time, with longer intervals between the acquisition events, perhaps
because of positive selection.
In addition to the reconstruction of the ancestral gene sets, we
compared the genome organizations of all of the sequenced
Lactobacillales genomes with previously developed computa-
tional methods (44). Only closely related species showed signif-
icant genome colinearity above the level of individual operons,
and there was virtually no large-scale conservation of gene order
between the four major groups of the Lactobacillales (data not
shown). Thus, the processes of gene loss and acquisition during
the evolution of these bacteria were accompanied by extensive
genome rearrangements.
Phyletic Patterns and Central Metabolism Reconstruction. Given the
prominence of sugar metabolism and energy conversion systems in
Lactobacillales, we examined the evolution of these systems through
phyletic patterns, reflecting the presence or absence of genes in
individual genomes in a manner similar to that described in ref. 45.
Most of the genes involved in these functions are represented in all
species (Fig. 7 and Table 7, which are published as supporting
information on the PNAS web site). These genes include those
coding for the downstream part of glycolysis, from glyceralde-
hyde-3P to pyruvate and pyruvate conversion to lactate and 2,3-
butandiol; acetate formation from acetyl-CoA; several reactions of
the pentose–phosphate pathway; and the mannose-specific phos-
photransferase system. Clearly, these enzymes are insufficient to
completely define the metabolism of any individual species, and
several reactions are specific to individual lineages. The presence
absence patterns of key enzymes involved in lactate fermentation
poorly correlate with the phenotypes of the Lactobacillales (Table
7). However, it has been shown that under certain conditions
Lactobacillales can switch between sole production of lactic acid and

the production of mixed end products, including acetic acid, lactic
acid, ethanol, and CO2 (46, 47).
The metabolic potential of the Lactobacillales is comple-
mented by its predicted transport capabilities. In particular,
amino acid uptake systems dominate over sugar and peptide
uptake systems. Among the detected sugar uptake systems, those
specific for oligosaccharides and glycosides outnumber those for
free sugars. In addition, Lactobacillales encode a variety of
predicted drug, peptide, and macromolecular efflux pumps,
some of which are likely to be involved in intercellular signaling.
Other metabolic capabilities of Lactobacillales are listed in
Table 8, which is published as supporting information on the
PNAS web site. Generally, Lb. brevis, Lb. johnsonii, Lb. gasseri,
Lb. delbrueckii, and P. pentosaceus have extremely narrow rep-
ertoires of biosynthetic pathways, whereas Lc. lactis ssp. lactis,
Lc. lactis ssp. cremoris, Lb. plantarum, and Le. mesenteroides
retain a much broader biosynthetic repertoire.
The Bacteriocins. Lactobacillales are known for producing spe-
cific antimicrobial peptides, the bacteriocins (48, 49). Several
proteins are responsible for the modification, export, and
regulation of bacteriocin production and are often encoded in
the same operon with the bacteriocins (48, 49). Because
bacteriocins are small proteins with highly diverged sequences,
they are often hard to identify by amino acid conservation.
Therefore, genome context analysis is required for a more
complete characterization of the bacteriocin repertoire.
Among the Lactobacillales genomes analyzed here, seven have
clustered genes for (putative) bacteriocins and associated
proteins. Within these regions, we identified two prebacterio-
cin families. One family consists of precursors of a known
bacteriocin, pediocin from P. pentosaceus, homologs of which
also are present in Le. mesenteroides and Lb. casei (La-
COG01709). The second family consists of previously uniden-
tified putative bacteriocin precursors distantly related to Di-
vercin V41 (50) and present in P. pentosaceus and Lb. johnsonii
(LaCOG03352). In addition, numerous small ORFs located in
the immediate vicinity of the putative genes for bacteriocins
and associated proteins might encode novel peptides (Fig. 8,
which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web
site). Bacteriocin-production-related genes seem to be among
those that are often transferred horizontally as indicated by the
analysis of the respective phylogenetic trees and differences in
the operon organization, even in closely related genomes.
Concluding Remarks. This work is an extensive comparative analysis
of a compact group of relatively closely related prokaryotic ge-
nomes that show a gradient of sequence conservation. Loss of
ancestral genes and metabolic simplification are the central trends
of LAB evolution. Major gene loss already occurred at the stage of
the common ancestor of Lactobacillales, which indicates early
adaptation to nutritionally rich environments. However, genome
degradation appears to be an ongoing process given that all species
of Lactobacillales show loss of specific genes, and many possess
numerous pseudogenes. Beyond gene loss, Lactobacillales have
clear ancestral adaptations for nutritionally rich, microaerophilic
environments, which include acquisition via HGT and duplication
of genes for various enzymes and transporters of sugar and amino
acid metabolism. The molecular systems responsible for the pro-
duction of specific antimicrobials, such as the bacteriocins, are
among other adaptations that become apparent through compar-
ative genomic analysis, probably reflecting the long-term existence
of Lactobacillales in complex microbial communities. Comparison
of the genomes of Lactobacillales suggests that the milk-digesting
phenotype evolved independently in different bacterial lineages.
This phenotype apparently does not require a unique set of genes
but rather emerged through assortment and adaptation of enzymes
shared with other bacteria.
The comparative genomic analysis described here also sug-
gests a revision of the taxonomy of the Lactobacillales. Phylo-
genetic analysis of multiple protein sequences showed that the
streptococci–lactococci branch is basal in the Lactobacillales tree
and that the Pediococcus group is a sister to the Leuconostoc
group, which supports the paraphyly of the Lactobacillus genus.
Furthermore, Lb. casei is confidently placed at the base of the
Lb. delbrueckii group, which contradicts the earlier classification.
Materials and Methods
Whole-genome shotgun sequencing was carried out at the U.S.
Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute. Genomes were
sequenced to 8 depth and assembled by using Jazz, the
Joint Genome Institute assembler (51). Gap closure was
carried out at Fidelity Systems, Inc., by using direct genomic
sequencing (52).
ORFs were identified with the GeneMarkS program (53). Gene
functions were predicted by assigning predicted genes to COGs
(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.govCOG) by using the COGNITOR method
(24) and by database searches conducted with the PSI-BLAST
program (54). Transfer RNAs were predicted with the
tRNAscan-SE program (55). LaCOGs were constructed by using
previously described procedures (23, 56). Phylogenetic analysis was
performed by using the least-square or maximum-likelihood meth-
ods, and gene gainloss scenarios were reconstructed with a version
of the weighted parsimony algorithm (29).
Additional methodological details and a detailed list of data
deposition numbers are provided in Supporting Materials and
Methods, which is published as supporting information on the
PNAS web site.
