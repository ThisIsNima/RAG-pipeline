Marine stickleback fish have colonized and adapted to thousands of streams and lakes formed since the last ice age,
providing an exceptional opportunity to characterize genomic mechanisms underlying repeated ecological adaptation in
nature. Here we develop a high-quality reference genome assembly for threespine sticklebacks. By sequencing the
genomes of twenty additional individuals from a global set of marine and freshwater populations, we identify a
genome-wide set of loci that are consistently associated with marine–freshwater divergence. Our results indicate
that reuse of globally shared standing genetic variation, including chromosomal inversions, has an important role in
repeated evolution of distinct marine and freshwater sticklebacks, and in the maintenance of divergent ecotypes during
early stages of reproductive isolation. Both coding and regulatory changes occur in the set of loci underlying marine–
freshwater evolution, but regulatory changes appear to predominate in this well known example of repeated adaptive
evolution in nature.
The genetic and molecular basis of adaptive evolution is still largely
unknown. Some researchers have championed a pre-eminent role for
regulatory changes during evolution of adaptive phenotypes, because
such changes may avoid pleiotropic consequences of protein-coding
alterations1–3. Others have catalogued known phenotypic differences
caused by protein-coding changes and have questioned whether suf-
ficient case histories exist to estimate the relative frequency of regula-
tory and coding changes during adaptive evolution4. Despite progress
on individual traits5, it has been difficult to accumulate enough
examples in any particular group to obtain an overall picture of
molecular mechanisms underlying evolutionary change, particularly
for clearly adaptive phenotypes in wild organisms.
Threespine sticklebacks offer a powerful system for studying the
molecular basis of adaptive evolution in vertebrates. After the retreat
of Pleistocene glaciers, marine sticklebacks colonized and adapted to
many newly formed freshwater habitats, evolving repeated changes in
body shape,skeletal armour, trophic specializations,pigmentation,salt
handling, life history and mating preferences6,7. Recurrent evolution of
similar phenotypes in similar environments indicates that these traits
evolve by natural selection8. Distinctive marine and freshwater forms
can still hybridize, making it possible to map the genetic basis of
individual traits, and identify particular genes underlying armour,
pelvic and pigmentation evolution9–12. At two of these key loci, dis-
tinctive haplotypes were found to be reused when similar phenotypes
evolve in different populations11,12, a pattern that was later found at
additional loci13,14. Ongoing gene flow between marine and freshwater
forms occurs along coastal rivers15,16, making it possible to spread
adaptive alleles among populations, and homogenizing neutral
genomic regions17. Here we use signatures of allele sharing to identify
a genome-wide set of adaptive loci consistently associated with
recurrent marine–freshwater evolution.
Generation of reference genome assembly
To facilitate studies of stickleback evolution, we first generated a
reference genome assembly from a homogametic (female) freshwater
stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) from Bear Paw Lake, Alaska. The
sequenced individual was partially inbred and retained heterozygosity
at approximately 1 per 700 base pairs (bp). The assembly, gasAcu1.0,
was generated with 9.03 coverage in Sanger sequence data
(ABI3730), and has a length-weighted median (N50) contig size of
83.2 kilobases (kb), a length-weighted median (N50) scaffold size of
10.8 megabases (Mb) and a total gapped size of 463 Mb, close to
previous estimates of 530 Mb (ref. 18). The 113 largest scaffolds
(86.9%, 400.4 Mb) were anchored to stickleback linkage groups in
an F2 marine3 freshwater intercross, whereas 60.7 Mb in 1,812 smaller
scaffolds (N50 5 0.3Mb) remain unanchored. Use of a single partially
inbred individual, construction and assembly of a range of genomic
library sizes, and the relativelylow repeat and duplication content ofthe
stickleback genome have produced a highly contiguous anchored
genome assembly with contig and scaffold sizes much larger than other
published teleosts19–22 (Supplementary Table 1).
Thestickleback sequence was annotated using theEnsembl pipeline,
which predicted 20,787 protein-coding and 1,617 RNA genes (Sup-
plementary Table 2). Of the protein-coding genes, 7,614 showed

one-to-one orthology with mammals and an additional 7,192 showed
one-to-one orthology among fishes. The other 5,981 genes showed
complex orthology relationships, including some lineage-specific gene
expansions that contribute to stickleback adaptations (for example, a
duplicated mucin family encoding glue proteins used for male nest
building23). A total of 13.4% of the stickleback genome appeared to
be under evolutionary constraint when compared with other fishes
using PhastCons24. The conserved portion was roughly equally divided
between protein-coding and non-coding sequences, with ,71% of the
latter shared with mammals and ,29% representing fish-specific con-
served sequences (Supplementary Table 3).
Sequencing additional population pairs
To search for loci underlying repeated evolution in sticklebacks, we
first identified populations showing characteristic marine and fresh-
water morphology (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary
Table 4). Repeated adaptation to divergent marine and freshwater
environments resulted in marked correlated changes in body shape,
length, depth, fin position, spine length, eye size and armour plate
number (Fig. 1b). Because quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling
these traits map to many different chromosomes12,25–30, this morpho-
logical screen should identify populations differing in a genome-wide
range of adaptive loci underlying marine–freshwater differences.
From the distinct morphological clusters of marine and freshwater
fish, we selected multiple marine–freshwater pairs, from both Pacific
and Atlantic populations, including individuals from opposite ends of
rivers with marine–freshwater hybrid zones16 (21 fish in total, includ-
ing the reference genome individual). The sampling strategy should
minimize geographic bias in the data set, while maximizing the chance
for local exchange of neutral regions of the genome.
We generated 2.33 average coverage per individual using Illumina
sequencing (Supplementary Table 5 and Supplementary Information).
To identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we pooled data
from all fish and identified positions where at least four reads support a
variant allele. This criterion identified 5,897,368 candidate SNPs
(Supplementary Table 6), with most being true positives based on
experimental validation (n 5 48 tested, 82.6% confirmed; Supplemen-
tary Information).
Genome-wide survey of parallel evolution
Previous studies have shown that repeated armour evolution in
sticklebacks occurs through ancient variants at the EDA locus, which
are reused in multiple freshwater populations11 and are subject to
strong selection31. To identify loci where alleles have similarly been
used repeatedly during adaptive divergence of marine and freshwater
fish, we used two methods to look for regions where sequences of most
freshwater fish were similar to each other, but differed from sequences
typically found in marine populations. Note that this pattern will not
identify adaptive variants that are unique to individual freshwater
populations, but instead focuses on variants with striking evidence
of biological replication across populations.
First, we developed a self-organizing map-based iterative Hidden
MarkovModel(SOM/HMM) to identify the 20most common patterns
of genetic relationships (‘trees’) among the 21 individuals. Genomic
regions were assigned to pattern types on the basis of likelihood, with
boundaries defined using HMM transitions. This method iteratively

models recurring phylogenetic patterns on a local genomic basis with
increasing resolution (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Information). Most
of the genome was assigned to trees describing geographic relation-
ships between populations (for example, distinct Pacific versus
Atlantic clades, each containing marine and freshwater fish;
Supplementary Table 7 and Supplementary Figs 2 and 3). A total of
215 regions comprising 2,096,101 bp (0.46% of the genome; median
size: 4,684 bp) were assigned to one of four trees separating most
marine from most freshwater fish (Supplementary Fig. 3, trees a–d).
After filtering, the most prevalent marine–freshwater divergent tree
identified 90 genomic regions with a median size of 4,266 bp covering
848,691 bp (0.18% of the genome).
Second, we used a genetic distance-based approach (Fig. 1c) based
on building 21 3 21 pairwise nucleotide divergence (p) matrices for
each of 877,568 overlappingwindows acrossthe genome(2,500 bp, step
size: 500bp). Each distance matrix was used to calculate a marine–
freshwater cluster separation score (CSS), quantifying the average
distance between marine and freshwater clusters after accounting for
variance within ecotypes (Supplementary Information). The score is
highly correlated with genetic distance (FST), but provides increased
resolution under high divergence (Supplementary Fig. 4). After per-
mutation testing, we recovered 174 marine–freshwater divergent
regions, covering a total of 1,214,500bp (0.26% of the genome; median
size: 3,000 bp) at a 5% false discovery rate (FDR), and 84 divergent
regions covering 479,500 bp (0.10% of the genome; median: 4,000 bp)
at 2% FDR. To assign cluster membership in highly divergent genomic
regions, we also used an unguided Bayesian model-based data-driven
clustering (DDC; Fig. 2c and Supplementary Information). For each
windowof the genome,weestimated the most likelynumberofdistinct
clusters of fish (k 5 0 to 5) and the cluster memberships.
The independent SOM/HMM and CSS approaches bothsuccessfully
recover the previously described chromosomeIVEDA locus amongthe
top-scoring marine–freshwater divergent regions (Fig. 2). Notably, the
cluster membership assigned by DDC successfully recapitulates the
breakpoints of the minimal 16-kb shared freshwater EDA haplotype
(Fig. 2c) previously defined by a multi-year positional cloning study of
the major locus controlling armour plate differences in sticklebacks11.
Additional regions were identified on the same chromosome with
similar marine–freshwater divergence patterns, including regions
surrounding the developmental signalling gene WNT7B (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 5), and a locus involved in hormone and neurotransmitter
binding and metabolism (sulphotransferase 4a1, SULT4A (ref. 32)).
SOM/HMM and CSS defined many other loci that also show globally
shared marine–freshwater divergence, including 242regions identified
by either method (0.5% of the genome), and 147 regions identified by
both (0.2% of the genome). The median size of recovered regions
(,5 kb) approaches the size of individual genes, and often highlights
purely intergenic regions, such as the exclusively non-coding region
identified between BANP and RAS on chromosome XIX (Sup-
plementary Fig. 6). The genomic distribution, sizes and overlaps of
recovered regions are described in Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. 7 and
Supplementary Table 8, including a list of specific genes identified in
top-scoring regions (Supplementary Data 1). Using genotyping assays
for SNPs in 11 regions recovered by both SOM/HMM and CSS ana-
lyses, we found that 91% of tested regions show significant enrichment
of ecotypic alleles in independent marine and freshwater populations
(Supplementary Information). These results confirm that our experi-
mental design successfully identifies both known and novel loci con-
sistently associated with parallel evolution of distinct marine and
freshwater ecotypes.
Compared to the genome overall, the 242 regions implicated in
repeated marine–freshwater evolution show higher gene density
(Supplementary Fig. 8, P , 4.5 3 10213) and higher concentration of
conserved non-coding sequences in intergenic regions (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 9, P , 1.9 3 10211), probably reflecting a more complex
regulatory architecture33. Gene Ontology analysis shows significant
enrichment of genes involved in cellular response to signals,
behavioural interaction between organisms, amine and fatty acid
metabolism, cell–cell junctions and WNT signalling (Supplementary
Table 9). Changes in these biological processes, and in the individual
genes defined by parallel divergence analysis, probably underlie recur-
rent differences in morphology, physiology and behaviour previously
described in marine and freshwater sticklebacks7. For example, the
WNT7B and WNT11 family members identified by the genomic
survey have previously been implicated in a paracrine signalling
pathway that controls kidney collecting tubule length and diameter34.
Fish living in fresh water produce copious hypotonic urine compared
to marine fish35, and long-term adaptation to freshwater may select for

epithelial cell divisions and regulate kidney tubule formation in other
animals.
Extent of parallel reuse in hybrid zones
Although our method identifies regions used repeatedly during
stickleback evolution, it does not tell us how prevalent such regions
are among all differentiated loci in a particular marine–freshwater
species pair. To address this, we analysed patterns of genomic differ-
entiation across a marine–freshwater hybrid zone in River Tyne,
Scotland (Fig. 4a). Previous studies show that ecologically mediated
postzygotic selection maintains distinct ecotypes in this system,
despite hybridization and opportunity for extensive gene flow16.
Whole-genome sequencing of a pair of marine and freshwater fish
from either end of the Tyne hybrid zone identified a set of genomic
windows with high divergence. Within the top 0.1% divergent
windows, 35.3% contain elevated globally shared marine–freshwater
divergence (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Information), indicating an
ancient shared origin for many, but not all, loci with highly differen-
tiated alleles in this marine–freshwater species pair. Previous studies
have shown that some traits in sticklebacks evolve by independent
mutations that vary among populations10. The non-globally shared
divergent alleles in the Tyne may also represent recent, or locally
arising, adaptive variants, although further studies will be required
to link such variants to particular traits, or to distinguish them from
neutral but highly variable regions of the stickleback genome.
Marine–freshwater chromosome inversions
When adaptive divergence occurs in hybridizing systems, theory pre-
dicts that selection can favour molecular mechanisms that suppress
recombination between independent adaptive loci17. We observed
extended stretches of elevated CSS spanning 442 kb, 412 kb and
1,700 kb on chromosomes I, XI and XXI, respectively (Fig. 3). On
the basis of sharp transitions in CSS score and DDC cluster assign-
ments at the boundaries, we hypothesized that chromosomal inver-
sions explain these extended regions. By analysing paired-end
sequence reads from a marine large-insert (,220 kb) bacterial

artificial chromosome (BAC) library36, we identified individual clones
with size and orientation anomalies relative to the freshwater reference
genome assembly. The only locations with five or more anomalous
clones mapped to chromosomes I, XI and XXI, and these anomalies
could be resolved by the presence of inverted chromosome seg-
ments between the marine fish and the freshwater reference genome
(Fig. 5a, b). Sequences flanking the predicted inversion breakpoints
contain inverted repeats, consistent with generation of inversions by
intra-chromosomal recombination (Supplementary Fig. 10). Notably,
repeats flanking the chromosome XI inversion contained alternative 39
exons for the voltage-gated potassium channel gene KCNH4. Because
KCNH4 transcription is initiated within the inversion, alternative
inversion orientations could generate marine- and freshwater-specific
KCNH4 isoforms (Fig. 5c). Although the functional consequences of
such ecotype-specific isoforms remain unknown, KCNH4 homologues
help to maintain resting currents, affect cardiac contractility, and alter
performance on cognitive tasks if perturbed in mice37–39. Furthermore,
QTL for two distinct marine–freshwater divergent traits have previ-
ously been mapped to the broad region of the chromosome XXI
inversion (Fig. 5d)27,30, as expected if inversions help to maintain
linkage between different adaptive QTLs40.
Importantly, cluster assignment of individual fish by DDC shows
that most marine and freshwater populations in the Pacific carry con-
trasting forms of the inversion regions (Supplementary Table 10).
Similar ecotype associations are seen in the Atlantic basin for chro-
mosome I (no exceptions), XI (two exceptions), and to a lesser extent
for chromosome XXI (three freshwater exceptions). Genetic markers
within the chromosome I and XXI regions are polymorphic in hybrid
zones, and show large frequency differences when genotyped in adja-
cent upstream and downstream fish, confirming that these regions are
subject to divergent selection in marine and freshwater habitats
(Supplementary Table 10). Our results help to explain the broader
patterns of genomic divergence seen in Fig. 3, and add to growing
evidence that chromosome inversions are a common genomic
mechanism that maintains contrasting ecotypes in hybridizing natural
populations41–44.
Proportion of regulatory and coding change
Identification of agenome-widesetoflociusedrepeatedlyinstickleback
adaptation provides a rare opportunity to estimate the relative contri-
bution of coding and regulatory changes underlying adaptive evolution
in natural populations. To examine this issue, we analysed 64 marine–
freshwater divergent regions with the strongest evidence of parallel
evolution: those identified by both SOM/HMM and CSS analyses using
the strictest significance thresholds (Supplementary Information and
Supplementary Data 1), and containing SNPs showing perfect allele–
ecotype association between marine and freshwater fish. Many of these
64regions (41%) mapped entirelyto non-codingregions ofthegenome,
and presumably contain regulatory changes (Fig. 6a). A smaller fraction
contains protein-coding sequences with consistent non-synonymous
substitutions between marine and freshwater fish (17%). Finally, a
fraction of regions (43%) include both coding and non-coding
sequences (including non-coding RNAs), but lack ecotype-specific
amino acid substitutions (Supplementary Data 1). Because all of these
regions contain SNPs with perfect allele–ecotype association that do
not cause protein-coding changes, they also probably contribute to
adaptive divergence by regulatory alterations. The combined data
suggest that both coding and regulatory differences contribute to
parallel stickleback evolution, with regulatory changes accounting
for a much larger proportion of the overall set of loci repeatedly
selected during marine–freshwater divergence.

To assess further the possible role of gene regulatory evolution in
stickleback evolution, we constructed whole-genome expression
arrays to compare levels of gene expression in tissues from Little
Campbell River (LITC) marine and Fish Trap Creek (FTC) freshwater
fish. Of 12,594 informative genes across the genome, 2,817 showed
significant expression differences between ecotypes. Genes with
marine–freshwaterexpressiondifferencesweresignificantlymorelikely
to occur in or near the adaptive regions recovered by SOM/HMM or
CSS analysis (Fig. 6b, P , 7.13 1028). Although expression differences
can be due to either cis- or trans-acting changes, the expression data are
consistent with an important role of regulatory changes during parallel
evolution of marine and freshwater sticklebacks.
Discussion
Progress in genetic mapping and positional cloning approaches has
recently made it possible to identify a few individual genes and muta-
tions that contribute to phenotypic differences between stickleback
populations10–12,25. Despite this progress, identifying many such
examples using genetic linkage mapping alone would require years
of additional effort. Fortunately, the highly replicated nature of
stickleback evolution provides clear molecular signatures that can
be used to recover many loci consistently associated with parallel
marine–freshwater adaptation. The signal resolution of repeatedly
used adaptive loci approaches ,5 kb, often identifying single genes
or intergenic regions, and offering a significant advantage over the
several hundred kilobase candidate intervals typically identified in
genetic mapping crosses11,12, or the megabase or larger regions iden-
tified in previous selection scans of the stickleback genome13. The
many marine–freshwater divergent loci and gene expression changes
identified in the current study will substantially accelerate ongoing
searches for the genetic and molecular basis of fitness-related mor-
phological, physiological and behavioural differences between marine
and freshwater fish.
In addition, the genome-wide set of divergent regions already
provides new insights into evolutionary processes shaping adaptive
evolution and ecological speciation. Our results indicate that parallel
evolution of marine and freshwater sticklebacks occurs by dynamic
reassembly of many ‘islands’ of divergence distributed across many
chromosomes. Reassembly by linkage is probably strengthened
by inversions that distinguish marine and freshwater ecotypes.
Differences in both globally shared and locally restricted genetic vari-
ation actively maintained across a hybrid zone provide a snapshot of
the genomic architecture and evolutionary processes contributing to
the early stages of reproductive isolation. Finally, our data indicate
that repeated evolution of marine–freshwater differences depends on
both protein-coding and regulatory changes. Regulatory evolution
seems to have a particularly prominent role, as indicated by the
increased density of conserved non-coding intergenic sequences
found near marine–freshwater divergent loci (Supplementary Fig. 9);
the substantial fraction of loci mapping entirely to non-coding regions
(Fig. 6a); and the significant enrichment of genes with expression
differences near key regions used for parallel evolution (Fig. 6b).

variants recovered in laboratory Escherichia coli and yeast evolution
experiments45,46. They make up 90% of 40published examples of adapt-
ive changes between closely related taxa4, and 63–77% of the known
molecular basis of phenotypic traits in domesticated or wild species5.
The larger fraction of regulatory changes implicated during repeated
stickleback evolution may reflect our use of whole-genome rather than
candidate gene approaches, stronger selection against loss-of-function
and pleiotropic protein-coding changes in natural populations than in
laboratory or domesticated organisms1–3, or an increasing prevalence of
regulatory changes at interspecific compared to intraspecific levels5,47,
including emerging species such as marine and freshwater sticklebacks.
Although our study has focused on marine–freshwater divergence,
freshwater sticklebacks also repeatedly evolve characteristic lake–stream
differences; open-water and bottom-dwelling lake ecotypes; gigantism
in particular lakes; and substantial changes in seasonality and life
history6,7,48–50. Given the considerable fraction of parallel stickleback
evolution probably occurring by shared variants (Fig. 4b), sequencing
of additional populations should make it possible to identify similarly
shared loci contributing to other ecological traits, again using the
power of replicated evolution to illuminate both specific and general
mechanisms underlying evolutionary change in natural populations.
METHODS SUMMARY
A reference stickleback genome sequence was assembled from a single female
freshwater stickleback (Bear Paw Lake, Alaska), using 93 coverage of paired-end
Sanger-sequenced reads from multiple insert size libraries. Scaffolds were
assigned to linkage groups in a genetic cross, and annotation was carried out
using the Ensembl evidence-based pipeline. Twenty-one fish from independent
populations were chosen for short-read sequencing (483 combined coverage)
based on morphometric analysis. Patterns of genetic variation were analysed
for divergence between marine and freshwater fish, using both a self-organizing
map/Hidden Markov Model and a pairwise distance matrix approach (see
Supplementary Information). Paired-end reads from a marine BAC library were
placed against the reference freshwater genome sequence to identify possible
chromosome rearrangements. Sequenom iPlex genotyping assays were carried
out to verify predicted SNPs and divergent marine–freshwater regions. RNA
samples were prepared from tissues of marine and freshwater fish born and raised
under identical laboratory conditions. Significant expression differences were
detected with Agilent microarrays using eBayes (limma R package). GO category
enrichments were analysed using GOstats (BioConductor 2.7). Additional
methods and analyses are provided in Supplementary Information.
