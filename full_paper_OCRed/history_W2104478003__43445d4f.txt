Review
Antimicrobial activity of ﬂavonoids

Abstract
Flavonoids are ubiquitous in photosynthesising cells and are commonly found in fruit, vegetables, nuts, seeds, stems, ﬂowers, tea, wine,
propolis and honey. For centuries, preparations containing these compounds as the principal physiologically active constituents have been
used to treat human diseases. Increasingly, this class of natural products is becoming the subject of anti-infective research, and many groups
have isolated and identiﬁed the structures of ﬂavonoids possessing antifungal, antiviral and antibacterial activity. Moreover, several groups
have demonstrated synergy between active ﬂavonoids as well as between ﬂavonoids and existing chemotherapeutics. Reports of activity
in the ﬁeld of antibacterial ﬂavonoid research are widely conﬂicting, probably owing to inter- and intra-assay variation in susceptibility
testing. However, several high-quality investigations have examined the relationship between ﬂavonoid structure and antibacterial activity
and these are in close agreement. In addition, numerous research groups have sought to elucidate the antibacterial mechanisms of action of
selected ﬂavonoids. The activity of quercetin, for example, has been at least partially attributed to inhibition of DNA gyrase. It has also been
proposed that sophoraﬂavone G and (−)-epigallocatechin gallate inhibit cytoplasmic membrane function, and that licochalcones A and C
inhibit energy metabolism. Other ﬂavonoids whose mechanisms of action have been investigated include robinetin, myricetin, apigenin, rutin,
galangin, 2,4,2′-trihydroxy-5′-methylchalcone and lonchocarpol A. These compounds represent novel leads, and future studies may allow the
development of a pharmacologically acceptable antimicrobial agent or class of agents.

1. Introduction
Resistance to antimicrobial agents has become an increas-
ingly important and pressing global problem. Of the 2 million
people who acquire bacterial infections in US hospitals each
year, 70% of cases now involve strains that are resistant to at
least one drug [1]. A major cause for concern in the UK is
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which
wasatlowlevelsadecadeagobutnowaccountsforca.50%of
all S. aureus isolates [2]. Substantial investment and research
in the ﬁeld of anti-infectives are now desperately needed if a
public health crisis is to be averted.
Structural modiﬁcation of antimicrobial drugs to which
resistance has developed has proven to be an effective means
of extending the lifespan of antifungal agents such as the
azoles [3], antiviral agents such as the non-nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitors [4], and various antibacterial agents

including -lactams and quinolones [5]. It is not surprising
then, that in response to antimicrobial resistance, major phar-
maceutical companies have tended to concentrate their efforts
on improving antimicrobial agents in established classes [6].
However, with the portfolio of chemotherapeutics currently
available, it has been acknowledged that researchers are get-
ting close to the end game in terms of parent structure alter-
ations. A call has therefore been made for the development
of new classes of drug that work on different target sites to
those in current use [7,8].
Rational drug design does not always yield effective
antimicrobials. In the past, potent enzyme inhibitors have
been successfully designed and synthesised but they had only
modest antibacterial activity, probably owing to the com-
plex issue of drug uptake by cells. Broad empirical screen-
ing of chemical entities for antimicrobial activity represents
an alternative strategy for the development of novel drugs.
Natural products have been a particularly rich source of
anti-infective agents, yielding, for example, the penicillins
in 1940, the tetracyclines in 1948 and the glycopeptides in

1955 [9]. The following review will examine the antimi-
crobial activity of ﬂavonoids, a class of natural products
possessing a diverse range of pharmacological properties.
Compounds with antifungal, antiviral and antibacterial activ-
ity will each be discussed in turn, with particular emphasis
on those ﬂavonoids with antibacterial activity.
2. Flavonoids: occurrence, functions, structure and
nomenclature
Flavonoids are ubiquitous in photosynthesising cells and
therefore occur widely in the plant kingdom [10]. They are
found in fruit, vegetables, nuts, seeds, stems and ﬂowers as
well as tea, wine [11], propolis and honey [12], and represent
a common constituent of the human diet [13]. In the US,
the daily dietary intake of mixed ﬂavonoids is estimated to
be in the range 500–1000 mg, but this ﬁgure can be as high
as several grams for people supplementing their diets with
ﬂavonoids or ﬂavonoid-containing herbal preparations [14].
The function of ﬂavonoids in ﬂowers is to provide colours
attractive to plant pollinators [11,15]. In leaves, these com-
pounds are increasingly believed to promote physiologi-
cal survival of the plant, protecting it from, for example,
fungal pathogens and UV-B radiation [13,15]. In addition,
ﬂavonoids are involved in photosensitisation, energy transfer,
the actions of plant growth hormones and growth regulators,
control of respiration and photosynthesis, morphogenesis and
sex determination [11,13].
The basic structural feature of ﬂavonoid compounds is the
2-phenyl-benzo[]pyrane or ﬂavane nucleus, which consists
of two benzene rings (A and B) linked through a heterocyclic
pyrane ring (C) (Fig. 1) [16]. Flavonoids can be classiﬁed
according to biosynthetic origin. Some classes, for exam-
ple chalcones, ﬂavanones, ﬂavan-3-ols and ﬂavan-3,4-diols,
are both intermediates in biosynthesis as well as end prod-
ucts that can accumulate in plant tissues. Other classes are
only known as end products of biosynthesis, for example
anthocyanidins, proanthocyanidins, ﬂavones and ﬂavonols.
Two additional classes of ﬂavonoid are those in which the
2-phenyl side chain of ﬂavanone isomerises to the 3 posi-
tion, giving rise to isoﬂavones and related isoﬂavonoids. The

rings named and positions numbered [13].
neoﬂavonoid is formed through further isomerisation to the 4
position [13]. Structures of the major classes of ﬂavonoids are
given in Fig. 2. The structures of speciﬁc compounds within
these classes that possess antimicrobial activity and that are
discussed in the present review are summarised in Table 1.
Individual ﬂavonoids may be assigned names in three dif-
ferent ways. Trivial names are employed extensively and
sometimes indicate ﬂavonoid class or plant source. For exam-
ple, names ending in ‘inidin’ can denote an anthocyanidin,
names ending in ‘etin’ generally denote a ﬂavonol, and
compounds tricin and hypolaetin have been extracted from
plants belonging to the genera Triticum and Hypolaena.
Flavonoids may also be named in a semi-systematic man-
ner based on trivial names such as ﬂavone or chalcone as
the parent structure, e.g. 3,5,7,3′4′-pentahydroxyﬂavone or
3,3′,4′,5,7-pentahydroxyﬂavone. Lastly, ﬂavonoids may be
given systematic chemical names, e.g. 3,4-dihydro-2-phenyl-
2H-1-benzopyran for ﬂavan, but this method is cumbersome
and rarely used [13]. In the present review, trivial names will
be used wherever possible.
3. Medicinal properties of ﬂavonoids
Increasingly, ﬂavonoids are becoming the subject of medi-
cal research. They have been reported to possess many useful
properties, including anti-inﬂammatory activity, oestrogenic
activity, enzyme inhibition, antimicrobial activity [10,13],
antiallergic activity, antioxidant activity [11], vascular activ-
ity and cytotoxic antitumour activity [15]. For a group
of compounds of relatively homogeneous structure, the
ﬂavonoids inhibit a perplexing number and variety of eukary-
otic enzymes and have a tremendously wide range of activi-
ties. In the case of enzyme inhibition, this has been postulated
to be due to the interaction of enzymes with different parts of
the ﬂavonoid molecule, e.g. carbohydrate, phenyl ring, phe-
nol and benzopyrone ring [10]. Several reviews have been
writtenontheinteractionbetweenﬂavonoidsandmammalian
cells, including comprehensive articles by Harborne and
Williams [15] and Middleton et al. [20]. An extensive review
on the biochemistry and medical signiﬁcance of ﬂavonoids
has also recently been produced by Havsteen [21].
4. History of ﬂavonoid use in antimicrobial treatment
For centuries, preparations that contain ﬂavonoids as the
principal physiologically active constituents have been used
by physicians and lay healers in attempts to treat human
diseases [10]. For example, the plant Tagetes minuta (contain-
ing quercetagetin-7-arabinosyl-galactoside) has been used
extensively in Argentine folk medicine to treat infectious dis-
ease [22]. The healing properties of propolis (or ‘tzori’ in
Hebrew) are referred to throughout the Old Testament [23],
and this balm was prescribed by Hippocrates (460–377 BC)
in Ancient Greece for the treatment of sores and ulcers [24].

Note: Hinokiﬂavone and robustaﬂavone are biﬂavonoids (also known as biﬂavonyls) consisting of two apigenin molecules joined through I-6-O-II-4′ and
I-6-II-3′ linkages, respectively.
The antimicrobial properties of propolis have been attributed
to its high ﬂavonoid content and in particular the presence of
the ﬂavonoids galangin and pinocembrin [12,25–27]. Huang-
chin (Scutellaria baicalensis) is yet another example. This
herbal medicine has been used systemically and topically for
thousands of years in China for the treatment of periodontal
abscesses and infected oral wounds. The ﬂavone baicalein is
reported to be largely responsible for this plant’s antimicro-
bial effects [28].
5. Toxicity of ﬂavonoids
It has been suggested that because ﬂavonoids are widely
distributed in edible plants and beverages and have previously
been used in traditional medicine, they are likely to have
minimal toxicity. However, this family of compounds has a
diverse range of activities in mammalian cells [14,20] and in
vivo conﬁrmation of their side effects would be necessary for
a full evaluation of their practical usefulness in the ﬁeld of
modernmedicine[29].Giventhattheselectivityofﬂavonoids
for eukaryotic enzymes appears to vary from compound to
compound [15,20], such a study would need to assess the
toxicity of these phytochemicals on an individual basis.
6. Antifungal activity of ﬂavonoids
Owing to the widespread ability of ﬂavonoids to inhibit
spore germination of plant pathogens, they have been pro-
posed for use against fungal pathogens of man [15]. A new
prenylated ﬂavanone recently isolated from the shrub Eysen-
hardtia texana has been identiﬁed as 5,7,4′-trihydroxy-8-
methyl-6-(3-methyl-[2-butenyl])-(2S)-ﬂavanone and shown
to possess activity against the opportunistic pathogen
Candida albicans [30]. The ﬂavonoid 7-hydroxy-3′,4′-
(methylenedioxy)ﬂavan, isolated from Terminalia bellerica
fruit rind, has also been shown to possess activity against C.
albicans[31].TwonewﬂavonesfromArtemisiagiraldi,iden-
tiﬁed as 6,7,4′-trihydroxy-3′,5′-dimethoxyﬂavone and 5,5′-
dihydroxy-8,2′,4′-trimethoxyﬂavone, together with 5,7,4′-
trihydroxy-3′,5′-dimethoxyﬂavone have been reported to
exhibit activity against Aspergillus ﬂavus [32], a species
of fungi that causes invasive disease in immunosuppressed
patients [33]. The activity of propolis against dermatophytes
and Candida spp. has been attributed at least partially to
its high ﬂavonoid content [34]. Galangin, a ﬂavonol com-
monly found in propolis samples [24], has been shown to
have inhibitory activity against Aspergillus tamarii, A. ﬂavus,
Cladosporium sphaerospermum, Penicillium digitatum and
Penicillium italicum [35].
7. Antiviral activity of ﬂavonoids
A recent area of research that is of particular interest is
the apparent inhibitory activity of some ﬂavonoids against
human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV). To date, most if not
all investigations have involved work with the pandemic HIV-
1 strain and its enzymes. In vitro studies have shown that
baicalin inhibits HIV-1 infection and replication. Inhibition
of HIV-1 entry into cells expressing CD4 and chemokine
co-receptors [36], and antagonism of HIV-1 reverse transcrip-
tase [37] by the ﬂavone O-glycoside have been demonstrated
by Li and colleagues. Baicalein [38], robustaﬂavone and
hinokiﬂavone [39] have also been shown to inhibit HIV-1
reverse transcriptase, as have several catechins, but catechins
inhibit other DNA polymerases and their interaction with
the HIV-1 enzyme is therefore thought to be non-speciﬁc
in nature [40]. In addition, it has been demonstrated that
several ﬂavonoids, including demethylated gardenin A and
3,2′-dihydroxyﬂavone, inhibit HIV-1 proteinase [41]. Robi-
netin, myricetin, baicalein, quercetagetin [42] and quercetin
3-O-(2′′-galloyl)--l-arabinopyranoside [43] inhibit HIV-1
integrase, although there are concerns that HIV enzyme inhi-
bition by quercetagetin and myricetin is non-speciﬁc [44]. It
has also been reported that the ﬂavonoids chrysin, acacetin
and apigenin prevent HIV-1 activation via a novel mech-
anism that probably involves inhibition of viral transcrip-
tion [45]. Interestingly, in a study by Hu and colleagues,
chrysin was reported to have the highest therapeutic index
of 21 natural and 13 synthetic ﬂavonoids against HIV-1 [46].

Several research groups have investigated the relationship
between ﬂavonoid structure and inhibitory activity against
HIV-1 and its enzymes [39,41,42,44,46]. Furthermore, at
least two groups have proposed mechanisms of action for
HIV-1 enzyme inhibition [41,42].
Flavonoids also have inhibitory activity against a variety
of other viruses. For example, Selway reports that quercetin,
morin, rutin, dihydroquercetin, dihydroﬁsetin, leucocyani-
din, pelargonidin chloride and catechin possess activity
against up to seven types of virus, including herpes simplex
virus (HSV), respiratory syncytial virus, poliovirus and Sind-
bis virus [11,47]. Proposed antiviral mechanisms of action
include inhibition of viral polymerase and binding of viral
nucleic acid or viral capsid proteins [47]. In addition to the
ﬂavonoids mentioned above, three proanthocyanidins from
Pavetta owariensis (with structural similarity to proantho-
cyanidin A2 and cinnamtannin B1 and B2) have been shown
to have activity against HSV and coxsackie B virus [48,49]. It
hasalsobeendemonstratedthattwooftheﬂavonoidsfoundin
propolis, chrysin and kaempferol, inhibit viral replication of
HSV, human coronavirus and rotavirus [50]. More recently,
the ﬂavonol galangin has been reported to have signiﬁcant
antiviral activity against HSV and coxsackie B virus [51].
Although naturally occurring ﬂavonoids with antiviral
activity have been recognised since the 1940s, it is only
in the last 25 years that attempts have been made to syn-
thetically modify ﬂavonoids for improved antiviral activity.
One such synthesised compound is 6,4′-dichloroﬂavan. How-
ever, despite showing strong in vitro activity, this compound
proved unsuccessful in clinical trials [11].
Synergism has been demonstrated between various com-
binations of ﬂavones and ﬂavonols. For example, kaempferol
and luteolin show synergy against HSV. It has been suggested
thatthisiswhypropolisismoreactivethanitsindividualcom-
ponent compounds [52]. Synergism has also been reported
between ﬂavonoids and other antiviral agents. Quercetin, for
example, potentiates the effects of 5-ethyl-2′-dioxyuridine
[11] and acyclovir [53] against HSV and pseudorabies infec-

activity
The antibacterial activity of ﬂavonoids is being increas-
ingly documented. Crude extracts from plants with a history
of use in folk medicine have been screened in vitro for
antibacterial activity by many research groups. Flavonoid-
rich plant extracts from species of Hypericum [54], Capsella
[55] and Chromolaena [55] have been reported to possess
antibacterial activity. Many other phytochemical prepara-
tions with high ﬂavonoid content have also been reported
to exhibit antibacterial activity [22,56–63]. Propolis has been
analysed on many occasions too, and samples containing high
concentrations of ﬂavonoids are frequently reported to show
antibacterial activity [12,25–27,50,64].
Many research groups have gone one step further and
either isolated and identiﬁed the structure of ﬂavonoids
that possess antibacterial activity, or quantiﬁed the activity
of commercially available ﬂavonoids. Examples of such
ﬂavonoids are apigenin [65–73], galangin [35,74–77],
pinocembrin [78,79], ponciretin [80,81], genkwanin [66,82],
sophoraﬂavanone G and its derivatives [29,83–85], naringin
and
naringenin
[29,60,86,87],
epigallocatechin
gallate
and its derivatives [74,88–95], luteolin and luteolin 7-
glucoside [69,73,96], quercetin, 3-O-methylquercetin and
various quercetin glycosides [60,65,72,87,97–102] and
kaempferol and its derivatives [60,65,74,76,87,98,100,103].

[86,118–120] and chalcones [79,104,111,121] with antibac-
terial activity have also been identiﬁed.
Some researchers have reported synergy between nat-
urally occurring ﬂavonoids and other antibacterial agents
against resistant strains of bacteria. Examples of these
include epicatechin gallate [122–125] and sophoraﬂavanone
G [83,84]. At least one group has demonstrated syn-
ergy between ﬂavonoids with antibacterial activity [126].
Others have synthetically modiﬁed natural ﬂavones and
analysed them for antibacterial activity [94,127–131]. For
example, Wang and colleagues have complexed 5-hydroxy-
7,4′-dimethoxyﬂavone with a number of transition metals
and shown that this process increases antibacterial activ-
ity [130]. Another group reported increased antibacterial
activity of 3-methyleneﬂavanones when the B ring con-
tained bromine or chlorine substituents [131]. Two research
groups have described the use of ﬂavonoids in vivo. In
a study by Vijaya and Ananthan, oral administration of
either 142.9 mg/kg quercetin or 214.3 mg/kg quercetrin pro-
tected guinea pigs against an induced Shigella infection that
killed untreated control animals [132]. More recently, Dasti-
dar and co-workers reported that intraperitoneal injection of
either 1.58 mg/kg sophoraisoﬂavone A or 3.16 mg/kg 6,8-
diprenylgenistein gave signiﬁcant protection to mice chal-
lenged with ∼9.5 × 108 colony-forming units (CFUs) of
Salmonella typhimurium [110].
8.2. Discrepancies between reports of ﬂavonoid
antibacterial activity
When reports of the antibacterial activity of ﬂavonoids are
compared, the results appear widely conﬂicting (Table 2).
For example, it was published that apigenin had no activity
against S. aureus at concentrations up to 128 g/mL [72];
a separate study in the same year reported that the ﬂavone
inhibited the growth of 15 strains of MRSA and 5 sensi-
tive strains of S. aureus at concentrations between 3.9 g/mL

and 15.6 g/mL [73]. From Table 2 it can be seen that such
discrepancies could perhaps be attributed on occasion to dif-
ferent assays being used (e.g. [65,70] and [72,73]). Many
differentassaysareemployedinﬂavonoidresearch,including
theagardilutiontechnique[29],thepaperdiskdiffusionassay
[115],thehole-platediffusionmethod[22],thecylinderdiffu-
sion method [60], the broth macrodilution technique [71] and
the broth microdilution technique [134]. In particular, assays
relying on diffusion of test ﬂavonoids may not give a reliable
quantitative measure of antibacterial activity because a potent
antibacterial ﬂavonoid may have a low rate of diffusion [32].
However, it is clear from Table 2 that additional factors are
involved in causing these discrepancies because even groups
using the same assay are obtaining conﬂicting results (e.g.
[67,96] and [67,72]). Such inconsistencies may be due to
variations within each assay. For example, different groups
using the agar dilution technique have used different sizes of
bacterial inoculum [81,86]. In a report by the National Com-
mitteeforClinicalLaboratoryStandards(NCCLS),inoculum
size was considered the single most important variable in sus-
ceptibility testing [135]. It should be noted that many groups
assaying ﬂavonoid antibacterial activity have not quantiﬁed
the test bacterial suspension [60,115] and others have not
even standardised the size of their unenumerated inocula
[35,56,76,90,97]. From the published work it is clear that,
in addition to inoculum size, there are many other variable
factors for each type of assay. These include volume of broth
or agar [90,116], type of broth or agar [86,92], size of wells
[56,60], size of paper disks [57,65], strains of a particular bac-
terial species used [69,72] and incubation period [90,116].
Recently, a set of guidelines was published for standard agar
dilution, broth macrodilution and broth microdilution meth-
ods [136]. This may help to reduce the number of conﬂicting
reports of ﬂavonoid antibacterial activity in the future. How-
ever, it will remain necessary to consider carefully additional
variables such as the solvent used to dissolve test ﬂavonoids
[116,118]. It has previously been shown that precipitation
occurs when selected ﬂavonoids are dissolved in organic
solvents and diluted with neutral polar solutions [75]. Precip-
itation of ﬂavonoids in a minimum inhibitory concentration
(MIC) assay is likely to cause diminished contact between
bacterial cells and ﬂavonoid molecules and may lead to false
negative reports of antibacterial activity. Also, in improp-
erly controlled experiments, ﬂavonoid precipitation could be
misinterpreted as bacterial growth and further false negative
results may be recorded as a consequence. The structural
alteration of ﬂavonoids such as galangin in alkaline solvents
is another matter for consideration [75]. If ﬂavonoid salts
are formed and these have increased or decreased potency
compared with the parent structure, this may lead to false
positive/negative reports of antibacterial activity. Other vari-
ables worth noting include whether the test ﬂavonoids are
obtained from a commercial or natural source [35,74] and
which companies [74,75]/natural products [71,72] the com-
pounds are from.

8.3. Structure–activity relationship for antibacterial
activity of ﬂavonoids
The diverse range of cell functions affected by ﬂavonoids
in eukaryotic systems is well documented [10,20]. Although
there have been comparatively few studies into the mecha-
nisms underlying ﬂavonoid antibacterial activity, information
from published literature indicates that different compounds
within this class of phytochemicals may target different com-
ponents and functions of the bacterial cell [137–139]. If this is
thecase,itissurprisingthatthesmallnumberofgroupswhich
have investigated the relationship between ﬂavonoid struc-
ture and antibacterial activity (summarised below) have been
able to identify common structural features among active
compounds. However, it may be that individual antibacte-
rial ﬂavonoids have multiple cellular targets, rather than one
speciﬁc site of action. Alternatively, these common structural
features may simply be necessary for ﬂavonoids to gain prox-
imity to or uptake into the bacterial cell.
Tsuchiya and colleagues sought to establish a structure–
activity relationship for ﬂavanones by isolating a number
of differently substituted compounds and determining their
MICs against MRSA [29]. Their study indicated that 2′,4′- or
2′,6′-dihydroxylation of the B ring and 5,7-dihydroxylation
of the A ring in the ﬂavanone structure was important for
anti-MRSA activity. Substitution at the 6 or 8 position with
a long chain aliphatic group such as lavandulyl (5-methyl-2-
isopropenyl-hex-4-enyl) or geranyl (trans-3,7-dimethyl-2,6-
octadienyl) also enhanced activity [29]. Interestingly, a recent
report by Stapleton and colleagues demonstrated that sub-
stitution with C8 and C10 chains also enhanced the anti-
staphylococcal activity of ﬂavonoids belonging to the ﬂavan-
3-ol class [94].
Osawa et al. assessed the activity of a number of struc-
turally different ﬂavonoids including ﬂavones, ﬂavanones,
isoﬂavones and isoﬂavanones based on the paper disk agar
diffusion assay [115]. It was shown that 5-hydroxyﬂavanones
and 5-hydroxyisoﬂavanones with one, two or three additional
hydroxyl groups at the 7, 2′ and 4′ positions inhibited the
growth of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus.
These results correlate well with those of Tsuchiya and col-
leagues [29]. It was also reported by Osawa and colleagues
that 5-hydroxyﬂavones and 5-hydroxyisoﬂavones with addi-
tional hydroxyl groups at the 7 and 4′ positions did not exhibit
thisinhibitoryactivity[115].However,whenSatoetal.exam-
ined two isoﬂavones with hydroxyl groups at the 5, 2′ and 4′
positions using an agar dilution assay, intensive inhibitory
activity was detected against a wide range of streptococcal
species[107].Thismaysuggestthathydroxylationatposition
2′ is important for activity. Alternatively, the lack of activity
detected by Osawa et al. may simply be due to the poor diffu-
sion of ﬂavones and isoﬂavones (compared with ﬂavanones
and isoﬂavanones) through the medium.
A more recent paper [104] also reports the importance of
a hydroxyl group at position 5 of ﬂavanones and ﬂavones
for activity against MRSA, supporting the earlier ﬁndings of
Tsuchiya et al. [29]. It further states that chalcones are more
effective against MRSA than ﬂavanones or ﬂavones, and that
hydroxyl groups at the 2′ position are important for the anti-
staphylococcal activity of these compounds. Methoxy groups
were reported to drastically decrease the antibacterial activ-
ity of ﬂavonoids [104]. The importance of hydroxylation
at the 2′ position for antibacterial activity of chalcones is
supported by earlier work from Sato and colleagues, who
found that 2,4,2′-trihydroxy-5′-methylchalcone and 2,4,2′-
trihydroxychalcone inhibited the growth of 15 strains of
cariogenic streptococci [140].
As mentioned previously, Ward and colleagues syn-
thesised
a
number
of
halogenated
derivatives
of
3-
methyleneﬂavanone [131]. Substitution of the B ring was
found to enhance antibacterial activity, with 3′-chloro, 4′-
chloro and 4′-bromo analogues each being approximately
twice as effective as their parent compound against S. aureus,
and four times more active against Enterococcus faecalis.
Also, the 2′,4′-dichloro derivative exhibited a four- to eight-
fold improvement in activity against S. aureus and a two-
to four-fold improvement against E. faecalis. By contrast,
3-methylene-6-bromoﬂavanone was less potent than the par-
ent compound and the authors suggested that halogenation
of the A ring may diminish activity [131]. Clearly, however,
it would be necessary to prepare analogues with substitu-
tion at other A-ring positions before this could be said with
any certainty. In chalcones, neither ﬂuorination nor chlo-
rination at position 4 of the B ring is reported to affect
antibacterial potency signiﬁcantly [104]. Again, however,
other structural analogues of this class of ﬂavonoids would
need to be synthesised and examined before the effect of
halogenation upon antibacterial activity could be properly
assessed.
8.4. Nature of ﬂavonoid activity: bacteriostatic or
bactericidal?
Several research groups have attempted to determine
whether ﬂavonoid activity is bacteriostatic or bactericidal
by conducting time–kill studies. In such experiments, epi-
gallocatechin gallate [89], galangin [75] and 3-O-octanoyl-
(+)-catechin [94] have been shown to cause a reduction of
1000-fold or more in viable counts of MRSA-YK, S. aureus
NCTC6571andEMRSA-16,respectively.Thiswouldimme-
diately appear to suggest that ﬂavonoids are capable of bac-
tericidal activity. However, it has recently been demonstrated
that 3-O-octanoyl-(−)-epicatechin induces the formation of
pseudomulticellular aggregates both in antibiotic-sensitive
and antibiotic-resistant strains of S. aureus [94]. If this phe-
nomenon is induced by other compounds within the ﬂavonoid
class (and liposomal studies suggest that this is the case for
epigallocatechin gallate [88]), questions are raised regarding
the interpretation of results from time–kill studies. It may
be that ﬂavonoids are not killing bacterial cells but merely
inducing the formation of bacterial aggregates and thereby
reducing the number of CFUs in viable counts.

8.5. Antibacterial mechanisms of action of various
ﬂavonoids
8.5.1. Inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis
In a study using radioactive precursors, Mori and col-
leagues showed that DNA synthesis was strongly inhibited
by ﬂavonoids in Proteus vulgaris, whilst RNA synthesis was
most affected in S. aureus [138]. Flavonoids exhibiting this
activity were robinetin, myricetin and (−)-epigallocatechin.
Protein and lipid synthesis were also affected but to a lesser
extent. The authors suggested that the B ring of the ﬂavonoids
may play a role in intercalation or hydrogen bonding with the
stacking of nucleic acid bases and that this may explain the
inhibitory action on DNA and RNA synthesis [138].
Ohemeng et al. screened 14 ﬂavonoids of varying struc-
ture for inhibitory activity against Escherichia coli DNA
gyrase, and for antibacterial activity against Staphylococ-
cus epidermidis, S. aureus, E. coli, S. typhimurium and
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia [68]. It was found that E. coli
DNA gyrase was inhibited to different extents by seven of
the compounds, including quercetin, apigenin and 3,6,7,3′,4′-
pentahydroxyﬂavone. Interestingly, with the exception of
7,8-dihydroxyﬂavone, enzyme inhibition was limited to
those compounds with B-ring hydroxylation [68,141]. The
authors proposed that the observed antibacterial activity of
the seven ﬂavonoids was due in part to their inhibition
of DNA gyrase. However, since the level of antibacterial
activity and enzyme inhibition did not always correlate,
they also suggested that other mechanisms were involved
[68].
More recently, Plaper and colleagues reported that
quercetinbindstotheGyrBsubunitofE.coliDNAgyraseand
inhibits the enzyme’s ATPase activity [142]. Enzyme binding
was demonstrated by isolating E. coli DNA gyrase and mea-
suring quercetin ﬂuorescence in the presence and absence
of the gyrase subunits. The ﬂavonoid-binding site was pos-
tulated to overlap with those of ATP and novobiocin, since
addition of these compounds interfered with quercetin ﬂuo-
rescence. Inhibition of GyrB ATPase activity by quercetin
was also demonstrated in a coupled ATPase assay. This
research is in agreement with the earlier ﬁndings of Ohe-
meng et al. [68] and supports the suggestion that quercetin’s
antibacterial activity against E. coli may be at least partially
attributable to inhibition of DNA gyrase.
WhenscreeningnaturalproductsfortypeIItopoisomerase
inhibitors, Bernard and co-workers found that the glycosy-
lated ﬂavonol rutin was very effective [143]. This compound
exhibited antibacterial activity against a permeable E. coli
strain (a strain into which the envA1 allele had been incor-
porated [144,145]). Using enzyme assays and a technique
known as the SOS chromotest, it was shown that rutin selec-
tively promoted E. coli topoisomerase IV-dependent DNA
cleavage, inhibited topoisomerase IV-dependent decatena-
tion activity and induced the SOS response of the E. coli
strain. The group suggested that since topoisomerase IV is
essential for cell survival, the rutin-induced topoisomerase
IV-mediated DNA cleavage leads to an SOS response and
growth inhibition of E. coli cells [143].
Within our own laboratory, a 4-quinolone-resistant S.
aureus strain was shown to have increased susceptibility
to the ﬂavonol galangin compared with other 4-quinolone-
sensitive and -resistant strains [146]. Interestingly, this strain
possesses a distinct amino acid substitution (serine to pro-
line) at position 410 of the GrlB subunit. This may suggest
that topoisomerase IV and the relatively homologous gyrase
enzyme are involved in the antibacterial mechanism of action
of galangin. Clearly, however, further work with mutant
strains and puriﬁed enzymes would be necessary before this
could be veriﬁed.
8.5.2. Inhibition of cytoplasmic membrane function
A research team that had previously found sophoraﬂa-
vanone G to have intensive antibacterial activity against
MRSA and streptococci [83–85] recently reported attempts
to elucidate the mechanism of action of this ﬂavanone
[139]. The effect of sophoraﬂavanone G on membrane ﬂu-
idity was studied using liposomal model membranes and
compared with the less active ﬂavanone naringenin, which
lacks 8-lavandulyl and 2′-hydroxyl groups. At concentra-
tions corresponding to the MIC values, sophoraﬂavanone
G was shown to increase ﬂuorescence polarisation of the
liposomes signiﬁcantly. These increases indicated an alter-
ation of membrane ﬂuidity in hydrophilic and hydrophobic
regions, suggesting that sophoraﬂavanone G reduced the ﬂu-
idity of outer and inner layers of membranes. Naringenin
also exhibited a membrane effect but at much higher con-
centrations. This correlation between antibacterial activity
and membrane interference was suggested to support the
theory that sophoraﬂavanone G demonstrates antibacterial
activity by reducing membrane ﬂuidity of bacterial cells
[139].
Another group, Ikigai and colleagues, carried out research
on (−)-epigallocatechin gallate, a strongly antibacterial cat-
echin found in green tea. Catechins are a group of ﬂavonoids
that appear to have greater activity against Gram-positive
than Gram-negative bacteria [88]. In this study, liposomes
were again used as model bacterial membranes, and it was
shown that epigallocatechin gallate induced leakage of small
molecules from the intraliposomal space. Aggregation was
also noted in liposomes treated with the compound. The
group therefore concluded that catechins primarily act on
and damage bacterial membranes. It was not known how
this damage occurred but two theories were put forward.
First, catechins may perturb the lipid bilayers by directly
penetrating them and disrupting the barrier function. Alterna-
tively, catechins may cause membrane fusion, a process that
results in leakage of intramembranous materials and aggrega-
tion. Interestingly, the group also demonstrated that leakage
induced by epigallocatechin gallate was signiﬁcantly lower
when liposome membranes were prepared containing nega-
tively charged lipids. It was therefore suggested that the low
catechin susceptibility of Gram-negative bacteria may be at

least partially attributable to the presence of lipopolysaccha-
ride acting as a barrier [88].
As mentioned previously, Stapleton and colleagues found
thatsubstitutionwithC8 andC10 chainsincreasedtheantibac-
terial activity of selected ﬂavan-3-ols (catechins). The group
went on to show that cells of an MRSA clinical isolate treated
with (−)-epicatechin gallate and 3-O-octanoyl-(+)-catechin,
respectively, exhibited moderately and highly increased lev-
els of labelling with the selectively permeable ﬂuorescent
stain propidium iodide. In addition, when S. aureus cells were
grown in the presence of either (−)-epicatechin gallate or 3-
O-octanoyl-(−)-epicatechin and examined by transmission
electron microscopy, they were shown to form pseudomulti-
cellular aggregates [94]. This work constitutes a substantial
advance in the development of catechins as antibacterial
agents and lends support to Ikigai’s argument that catechins
act on and damage bacterial membranes.
It has also been demonstrated by Sato and colleagues that
the chalcone 2,4,2′-trihydroxy-5′-methylchalcone induces
leakage of 260 nm absorbing substances from S. mutans.
This observation generally indicates leakage of intracellular
material such as nucleotide, and the authors suggested that
2,4,2′-trihydroxy-5′-methylchalcone exerts its antibacterial
effect by changing the permeability of the cellular membrane
and damaging membrane function [140].
In addition, the effect of galangin upon cytoplasmic
integrity in S. aureus has been investigated by measuring
loss of internal potassium [147]. When high cell densities
of S. aureus were incubated for 12 h in media containing
50 g/mL of the ﬂavonol, a 60-fold decrease in the number
of CFUs was noted and cells lost ca. 20% more potassium
than untreated control bacteria. These data strongly suggest
that galangin induces cytoplasmic membrane damage and
potassium leakage. Whether galangin damages the mem-
brane directly, or indirectly as a result of autolysis or cell wall
damage and osmotic lysis, remains to be established however
[147].
In an investigation into the antimicrobial action of propo-
lis, Mirzoeva and colleagues showed that one of its con-
stituent ﬂavonoids, quercetin, caused an increase in perme-
ability of the inner bacterial membrane and a dissipation of
the membrane potential [148]. The electrochemical gradient
of protons across the membrane is essential for bacteria to
maintain capacity for ATP synthesis, membrane transport and
motility. Mirzoeva et al. suggested that the effect of propo-
lis on membrane permeability and membrane potential may
contribute enormously to its overall antibacterial activity and
may decrease the resistance of cells to other antibacterial
agents. It was thought that this might explain the synergistic
effect that occurs between propolis and other antibiotics such
as tetracycline [148] and ampicillin [149]. The group also
demonstrated that the ﬂavonoids quercetin and naringenin
signiﬁcantly inhibited bacterial motility, providing further
evidence that the proton motive force is disrupted. Bacte-
rial motility and chemotaxis are thought to be important in
virulence as they guide bacteria to their sites of adherence
and invasion. Mirzoeva et al. suggested that the antimotil-
ity action of propolis components may have an important
role in inhibition of bacterial pathogenesis and the develop-
ment of infection [148]. The cytoplasmic membrane activ-
ity detected for quercetin by Mirzoeva and co-workers may
represent one of the additional mechanisms of antibacterial
action that was suspected to be present among the seven DNA
gyrase-inhibiting ﬂavonoid compounds tested by Ohemeng
and colleagues [68].
8.5.3. Inhibition of energy metabolism
Haraguchi and colleagues recently carried out an investi-
gation into the antibacterial mode of action of two retrochal-
cones (licochalcone A and C) from the roots of Glycyrrhiza
inﬂata [137]. These ﬂavonoids demonstrated inhibitory activ-
ity against S. aureus and Micrococcus luteus but not against
E. coli, and in preliminary tests licochalcone A inhibited
incorporation of radioactive precursors into macromolecules
(DNA, RNA and protein). The group hypothesised that the
licochalcones may be interfering with energy metabolism
in a similar way to respiratory-inhibiting antibiotics, since
energy is required for active uptake of various metabolites
and for biosynthesis of macromolecules [137]. Interestingly,
the licochalcones were found to inhibit strongly oxygen con-
sumption in M. luteus and S. aureus but not in E. coli, which
correlated well with the observed spectrum of antibacterial
activity. The group further demonstrated that licochalcones
A and C effectively inhibited NADH-cytochrome c reduc-
tase, but not cytochrome c oxidase or NADH-CoQ reductase.
It was therefore suggested that the inhibition site of these
retrochalcones was between CoQ and cytochrome c in the
bacterial respiratory electron transport chain [137].
Merck Research Laboratories recently reported that the
ﬂavanone lonchocarpol A inhibits macromolecular synthesis
in Bacillus megaterium. Using radioactive precursors, it was
demonstrated that RNA, DNA, cell wall and protein synthesis
were all inhibited at concentrations similar to the MIC value
[150]. This may represent another example of a ﬂavonoid that
interferes with energy metabolism.
9. Concluding remarks
With regard to natural products, it is generally accepted
thatphytochemicalsarelesspotentanti-infectivesthanagents
ofmicrobialorigin,i.e.antibiotics[48].However,newclasses
of antimicrobial drug are urgently required and the ﬂavonoids
represent a novel set of leads. Future optimisation of these
compounds through structural alteration may allow the devel-
opment of a pharmacologically acceptable antimicrobial
agent or group of agents. Existing structure–activity data
suggest that it might be possible, for example, to prepare
a potent antibacterial ﬂavanone by synthesising a compound
with halogenation of the B ring as well as lavandulyl or ger-
anyl substitution of the A ring. Also, it is worth noting that
the rapid progress which is being made toward elucidation

353
of ﬂavonoid biosynthetic pathways [151] may soon allow
the production of structural analogues of active ﬂavonoids
through genetic manipulation. Screening of these analogues
might lead to the identiﬁcation of compounds that are sufﬁ-
ciently potent to be useful as antifungal, antiviral or antibac-
terial chemotherapeutics. In addition to the structural alter-
ation of weak and moderately active antimicrobial ﬂavonoids,
investigation into the mechanisms of action of these com-
pounds is likely to be a productive area of research. Such
information may assist in the optimisation of a lead com-
pound’s activity, provide a focus for toxicological attention
and aid in the anticipation of resistance. Also, characterisa-
tion of the interaction between antimicrobial ﬂavonoids and
their target sites could potentially allow the design of second-
generation inhibitors.

Errors occurred during typesetting of Table 1 for the above review article. The ﬂavonol morin has hydroxyl groups at positions
3, 5, 7, 2′ and 4′ (not 3, 7, 2′, 4′ and 5′), and the ﬂavan-3-ol catechin has hydroxyl groups at positions 3, 5, 7, 3′ and 4′ (not 3,
4, 7, 3′ and 5′). The structures of these compounds should have been given in Table 1 as shown below.
