A broad compilation of modern carbon isotope compositions in all
C3 plant types shows a monotonic increase in δ13C with decreasing
mean annual precipitation (MAP) that differs from previous mod-
els. Corrections for temperature, altitude, or latitude are smaller
than previously estimated. As corrected for altitude, latitude,
and the δ13C of atmospheric CO2, these data permit refined inter-
pretation of MAP, paleodiet, and paleoecology of ecosystems
dominated by C3 plants, either prior to 7–8 million years ago
(Ma), or more recently at mid- to high latitudes. Twenty-nine pub-
lished paleontological studies suggest preservational or scientific
bias toward dry ecosystems, although wet ecosystems are also
represented. Unambiguous isotopic evidence for C4 plants is lack-
ing prior to 7–8 Ma, and hominid ecosystems at 4.4 Ma show no
isotopic evidence for dense forests. Consideration of global plant
biomass indicates that average δ13C of C3 plants is commonly over-
estimated by approximately 2‰.

P
lants exhibiting C3 photosynthesis have dominated the history
of terrestrial vegetation, as CAM plants occupy only a small
percentage of typical ecosystems (e.g., 1), and C4 plants became
abundant in grasslands only within the last 7–8 million years (2).
C3 plants exhibit a large range of carbon isotope compositions
(−20 to −37‰, V-PDB; Fig. 1), generally reflecting a physiolo-
gical response to aridity (anomalously high δ13C) and a combina-
tion of low light levels plus leaf litter recycling (anomalously low
δ13C; 3). Past studies have conflicted on the dependence of δ13C
on mean annual precipitation (MAP). Most studies support a
negative correlation (e.g., 4), but some have reported no correla-
tion (5) or even a positive correlation (6).
This study explores carbon isotope systematics of C3 plants
through a comprehensive compilation of literature data, minimiz-
ing local differences that have given rise to disparate interpreta-
tions. This work directly benefits paleodietary and paleoecological
studies by providing estimates of MAP in ancient environments
as well as clearer boundaries for identifying the understory of
closed-canopy forests and the contribution of non-C3 plants to
diet, which is used to gain insights into C4 origins (2). The new
compilation also helps refine models of the modern carbon cycle
by providing a better estimate of global C3 δ13C values (7). The
present analysis differs from a recent investigation of correlations
between tree þ shrub δ13C and MAP or plant functional type (8)
in that it is several times larger on a site-by-site basis, spans the
full range of plant growth forms (including trees, bushes, grasses,
and herbs), averages data from each site to minimize sampling
bias (4), and regresses an arguably more appropriate function
to the data. Selection criteria of climate and isotopic data also dif-
fer slightly. This broader approach of considering all C3 plants and
averaging compositions is important when evaluating herbivore
paleodiets, which are not restricted to trees, and further reveals
significant differences in modeled compositions at low MAP and
in the estimated effect of altitude and latitude. A simple function
allows MAP to be estimated from δ13C of fossil bone collagen and
tooth enamel and used for inferring terrestrial climate change.
Past studies of dietary ecology and global C3 plant δ13C values
further indicate an analytical bias toward dry ecosystems.
Results
Data. The dataset, provided in Dataset S1, encompasses all types
of C3 plants, including trees, shrubs, herbs, and grasses from
approximately 570 individual sites, and spans ranges of MAP,
mean annual temperature (MAT), altitude, and latitude of 1 to
3;700 mm∕yr, −13.5 to 28.4 °C, −391 to 4,900 m, and 54.9°S to
69.5°N. This dataset is ca. six times larger than any previous
analysis of C3 isotopic systematics and covers more types of C3
plants.
C3 Data Distributions. For the global C3 δ13C dataset, a histogram
of corresponding MAP values (Fig. 1A) demonstrates research
bias toward dry ecosystems (high δ13C) and tropical rain forests
(low δ13C). Thus the histogram of δ13C values, which shows the
well-known range from −20 to −37‰ (Fig. 1B), is broader than
expected for global C3 biomass. Values above −23‰ are almost
completely restricted to the Atacama Desert (9), the driest desert
on Earth, and to Pinus in dry settings (10). Values below −31.5‰
reflect canopy effects in low-light tropical forests. The compila-
tion from O’Leary (11; downward corrected by −0.25‰ for
fossil fuel burning) and from this study average about −27.25‰
and −27.0‰, respectively, omitting understory analyses below
−31.5‰.
Correlation of MAP with δ13C. Carbon isotope compositions exhibit
a systematic change over the range of MAP, excepting low δ13C
values associated with the understory of dense forests (Figs. 1
and 2). High δ13C values (above −25.5‰) are essentially re-
stricted to environments with MAP < 500 mm∕yr. The trend
noticeably “flattens” at high MAP, indicating nearly constant
isotopic discrimination in wet environments. Other attempts to
quantify this correlation have resulted in widely disparate results
(Fig. 2), largely because they were based on limited datasets. The
results of Stewart et al. (4) and Diefendorf et al. (8) most closely
match the new compilation, but the Stewart et al. model deviates
from observations at MAP > 1;000 mm∕yr, whereas the Diefen-
dorf et al. model predicts unusually high δ13C values at low
MAP (Fig. 2). The preferred equation for MAP as a function
of δ13C is:

over the functional form used by Diefendorf et al. (8; R2 ¼
0.34, including their altitude and latitude coefficients). These
equations allow evaluation of the effects of MAP, altitude, and
latitude on δ13C values or Δ, or alternatively estimation of MAP
from altitude, latitude, and δ13C or Δ. Note that the altitude coef-
ficient is smaller by a factor of 3 to 5,000 than indicated in other
studies (8, 12). Latitudinal effects have not been estimated for
data that simultaneously account for altitude and MAP. Uncer-
tainties of 0.5‰ in mean δ13C or Δ propagate to uncertainties
in MAP of as little as 100 mm∕yr at MAP ¼ 100–500 mm∕yr,
to 500 mm∕yr at MAP ∼2;000 mm∕yr.
Discussion
Average C3 Composition and Isotopic Bounds on C3 δ13C. A commonly
quoted “average” C3 composition (δ13CC3;ave) is −26 to −27‰
(e.g., 2, 13–15) similar to or slightly higher than compilation
means (Fig. 1). Such high values, however, are strongly biased
toward dry ecosystems (Fig. 1A). For example, the global
δ13CC3;ave, as estimated from Eq. 3 and distributions of plant bio-
mass and precipitation, is approximately −28.5‰, or approxi-
mately 2‰ lower than commonly assumed. This low δ13CC3;ave
mainly reflects the importance of equatorial and midlatitude
northern hemisphere C3 biomass, which is less well represented
in the literature. The δ13CC3;ave value is important for models of
carbon fluxes, atmospheric CO2 compositions, and soil organic
matter (e.g., 7, 15–17). Seasonal changes to δ13Catm depend on
C3–C4 biomass ratios and their compositions, and differences
in modeled C3 biomass discrimination perturb predicted δ13C
of atmospheric CO2 most strongly (16). The dataset and equations
developed here could be used to test and calibrate these models.
Considering
that
δ13C > −23‰
is
restricted
to
MAP <
10 mm∕yr, non-C3 vegetation (e.g., C4 plants, lichen, or CAM
plants) or the genus Pinus in some settings, this value is recom-
mended as a likely maximum for typical C3 plants. Likewise,
δ13C < −31.5 is recommended as a cutoff indicating the unders-
tory of closed-canopy forests.
Paleoprecipitation Reconstructions. The regressed curve allows
prediction of MAP from the average modern equivalent of diet
composition (δ13Cdiet;meq), which can be estimated from fossil
tooth or collagen δ13C values and δ13Catm (see SI Text). Most
studies that inferred mixed C3-C4 ecosystems were omitted
from consideration because obvious C4 consumption (δ13Cdiet;meq
values for individual species well above −22‰) would otherwise
imply low or negative MAP. Corrections for δ13Catm are key for
predicting accurate C3 composition and MAP. For example,
two high values for tooth enamel δ13C at approximately 15.5 Ma
in East Africa (c. −8‰; 18) were interpreted as approximately
2‰ higher than the range of C3 compositions, requiring a C4
dietary component. A high δ13Catm at that time (c. −5.25, or a
2.75‰ downward correction), however, implies δ13Cdiet;meq of
∼−24.8‰, well within the range of a pure C3 diet in dry ecosys-
tems (Fig. 1B and Fig. 3, “m1”). Similarly large corrections apply
to several other studies (19–21) and indicate wetter conditions
than suggested by corrections for modern fossil fuel burning
alone (c. −1.5‰ correction).
Results correlate generally with previous interpretations re-
garding “dry” vs. “wet” environments and with the possibility of
alternative food sources. Few independent measures of MAP
are available but include estimates of 300–700 mm∕yr for late
Cenozoic Spain (22) vs. ∼500 mm∕yr (Fig. 3, “v”), approximately
1;200 mm∕yr for Paleocene-Eocene strata in Wyoming (23) vs.
∼1;000 mm∕yr (Fig. 3, “k”), and 740  280 mm∕yr for Eocene-
Oligocene strata in Nebraska (24) vs. approximately 200 mm∕yr
(Fig. 3, “z”). In the latter case, only a few taxa were analyzed, prob-
ably compromising estimates of average compositions. Several

other paleoenvironments were viewed as particularly wet, either
from paleobotanical and paleofaunal observations or because
of geographic location (20, 21, 25, 26). For three of these
studies, estimates of average MAP for these localities exceed
2;000 mm∕yr. For data from the Eocene Arctic (21), the relatively
high δ13C value results from the latitude correction, and a smaller
correction would result in a higher estimated MAP. Only two
studies have reported sufficiently low δ13C for any fossil species
to indicate closed-canopy conditions (20, 27). Taxonomically
extensive isotopic data do not directly support the conclusion that
the early hominid Ardipithecus ramidus occupied a closed forest
(28); the lowest inferred δ13Cdiet;meq is approximately −30.5‰
(for a colobine monkey), and the assumed isotopic boundary
for closed-canopy forests δ13Cdiet;meq ¼ −27.8‰) was unrealisti-
cally high. Overall most data from most studies appear to support
low MAP, typically <800 mm∕yr, below mean global MAP
between 60°S and 75°N (∼850 mm∕yr). This probably reflects
overall preservation or research bias toward drier ecosystems.
Two studies indicated average δ13Cdiet;meq above the range of
average C3 δ13C. Wang et al. (29) inferred consumption of high
δ13C C4 plants, which is consistent with the new compilation
(Fig. 3, “w”) and with individual δδ13Cdiet;meq values for several
taxa above −22‰ (i.e., generally inaccessible to C3 plants). Pleis-
tocene Irish deer data imply either dietary specialization on high
δ13Cdiet;meq C3 plants (Fig. 3, point “c1”; 30), or lichen consump-
tion (31).
Several qualifications apply to estimating MAP. First, environ-
ments with C4 plants cannot be interpreted because high
δ13Cdiet;meq may reflect C4 consumption rather than aridity,
although closed-canopy occupancy or C4 consumption can be
evaluated. Second, C3 plant isotope compositions within a single
locality show significant variation (e.g., Fig. 1B), and different
taxa prefer different microhabitats and foods. Robust estimates
of MAP thus require averaging over multiple taxa in a single
locality, just as strong correlations between global plant δ13C
and MAP require averaging (4; this study). Some studies analyze
numerous taxa (27, 32) and are well suited for estimating MAP,
whereas others focus on specific ecological or climatic questions
with only a few taxa or even just one taxon (19, 30, 33, 34), and
MAP estimates are more tentative. Dry environments may
contain wet microhabitats, e.g., along rivers or at springs, and
flora may exhibit relatively low δ13C values either seasonally or
in an unusually wet year. For example, δ13C of plants from the
dry environments in one study (35) might be interpreted as higher
MAP. In the most arid environments, plants may preferentially
grow in cracks or declivities where precipitation accumulates,
effectively increasing MAP (36), and other sources of precipita-
tion, such as fog, may contribute significantly to total moisture
(37, 38). These processes provide greater moisture than implied
by MAP alone, and in these cases paleo-MAP estimates will be

maxima. Last, it has been argued that higher past pCO2 resulted
in lower δ13C values for C3 plants, with a dependence of approxi-
mately 2‰∕100 ppm (e.g., 39). Eocene pCO2 estimates of
1,000–1,500 ppm (40), δ13Catm of −5.5 to −6 (41) and fossil tooth
enamel δ13C (19, 21, 25, 33) would then imply δ13Cdiet;meq of −5
to −10‰. Such high values exceed the range of even C4 plants
today (e.g., 11, 42), further supporting a negligible pCO2 correc-
tion (43).
Conclusions
Carbon isotope compositions show a distinct but nonlinear
increase in δ13C values with decreasing MAP. A regressed expres-
sion provides a new basis for estimating MAP from carbon
isotope compositions of fossil tooth enamel or collagen, after first
correcting for changes to δ13Catm, altitude, latitude, and physio-
logical fractionations. Research bias toward dry ecosystems
appears in analysis of paleoecologies. A downward revision in
modern δ13Cave for C3 plants may improve models of carbon
fluxes and soil δ13C values.
Methods
Data and methods are described in further detail in SI Text. In brief, data were
taken from the literature, preferring large natural datasets that included
date of collection, location, MAP, and mean annual temperature. In some
instances, specific locations were not provided, and an estimated or average
location was assigned based on descriptions in the primary source. Composi-
tions were corrected for secular changes to the composition of atmospheric
CO2 (δ13Catm) to a common δ13Catm of −8.00‰ based on modern secular
trends (0.023‰∕yr; 44). If not reported, the date of collection was assumed
to be 2 yr prior to the date of publication. Nearly all climate data were taken
directly from the original publications, and any gaps in climate data were
obtained from online and published local meteorological tabulations, or,
in the few instances where local data were unavailable, from models. Most
data are for whole leaves, and for nonleaf data, isotopic offsets were applied
as recommended by the authors. Where no recommendation was made,
offsets of −2‰ and −0.5‰ were assumed for soil organic matter and leaf
litter, respectively (15, 45). It may be argued that environmental parameters
other than MAP correlate better with leaf δ13C, such as potential evapotran-
spiration, water deficit, or growing season precipitation. Although such para-
meters may be calculated in modern settings, they involve additional
variables (e.g., seasonal temperature or precipitation) that may be difficult
to constrain in paleoenvironments. Modern data show sufficiently strong
correlations with MAP to allow MAP inferences.
Prior to regressions, data were averaged over all C3 plant species at
an individual site. This averaging approach differs markedly from all other
studies except Stewart et al. (4), whose dataset was over 40 times smaller.
Assignment of sites was based on how authors reported their data, i.e., if
authors distinguished one set of analyses from another then they were trea-
ted as separate sites. Understory, midlevel canopy, and upper-level canopy
compositions were distinguished in tropical forests, and analyses from differ-
ent years were considered as different sites. The total dataset has approxi-
mately 570 sites (∼95 usable sites from ref. 8) and is especially dense at low
MAP (Fig. 1C). Many different regression approaches were tested to relate
carbon isotope composition to MAP. Averaging data over small MAP ranges
(e.g., <100, 100–200, 250–300 mm∕yr, etc.) resulted in the highest correlation
coefficients (c. 0.95), but this approach is compromised by requiring a priori
corrections for altitude and latitude. Instead, the preferred and simpler ap-
proach involved regressing δ13C vs. altitude, latitude, and log10ðMAP þ moÞ,
where mo is an offset that is determined iteratively and ensures that the
intercept of the regression is finite. An alternative regression with Δ as
the dependent variable was also calculated. Outliers at 3σ from local means
were removed iteratively and represent approximately 4% of sites. Unders-
tory compositions from dense forests were also omitted (∼2% of sites). Data
from Schulze et al. (35) for MAP ¼ 130–250 mm∕yr deviate significantly from
global data trends. These data represent >50% of data in that precipitation
range and were collected in a single month during a wet year. To avoid
bias compared to other datasets, the Schulze et al. data for <200 and for
200–250 mm∕yr were averaged to separate values.
Global distributions of precipitation between 60°S and 75°N latitudes
were estimated from 2.5° grids obtained from the Global Precipitation
Climatology Center (GPCC) and averaged over 20 yr (1986 to 2005) (http://
gpcc.dwd.de). Global plant biomass was either assumed to increase linearly
with precipitation or taken from compilations of C3 plant biomass vs. latitude
(46), with precipitation vs. latitude for vegetated areas determined from
GPCC. The global average C3 value was then predicted by using the fitted
curve to model δ13C vs. MAP, ignoring low δ13C understory, which represents
a negligible fraction of total leaf biomass in the tropics (47, 48). Both
methods give comparable results (−28.4 vs. −28.5‰, respectively). Note
that these calculations ignore corrections for altitude but include a latitude
correction of approximately −0.3‰.
For comparison to herbivore tooth enamel and collagen compositions,
correction for changes to δ13Catm over geologic time was made based on
the δ13C of benthic foraminifera as adjusted for calcification temperature
(41; see also refs. 25 and 49). No dependence of plant δ13C on atmospheric
CO2 concentrations was considered because experimental data show no
consistent resolvable relationship for pCO2 between 200 and 1,300 ppm
(43). The effect of this assumption is further discussed. Compositions of fossil
teeth and collagen were converted to paleodietary plant composition by
subtracting 14‰ (42) and 5‰ (50), respectively, except for three studies
that focused exclusively on tooth enamel from bovids younger than 10 Ma
(30, 51, 52); for these a larger tooth-diet offset of 14.5‰ was used (53).
All paleodiet compositions were converted to Δ, and modern equivalent
compositions (δ13Cdiet;meq) were calculated for δ13Catm ¼ −8.00‰.

Paleodietary compositions corrected for altitude and latitude con-
toured for MAP; this plot permits interpretation of paleoenvironments from
carbon isotope compositions of fossil tooth enamel or collagen. Tooth
enamel and collagen compositions are averaged across species and cor-
rected for δ13C of atmospheric CO2, physiological fractionations, altitude,
and latitude. Most data plot at MAP ≤800 mm∕yr, i.e., relatively dry envir-
onments, although wetter environments are also represented. b1 ¼ Bibi
