INTRODUCTION
The successful use of any therapeutic agent is compromised
by the potential development of tolerance or resistance to that
compound from the time it is ﬁrst employed. This is true for
agents used in the treatment of bacterial, fungal, parasitic, and
viral infections and for treatment of chronic diseases such as
cancer and diabetes; it applies to ailments caused or suffered
by any living organisms, including humans, animals, ﬁsh,
plants, insects, etc. A wide range of biochemical and physio-
logical mechanisms may be responsible for resistance. In the
speciﬁc case of antimicrobial agents, the complexity of the
processes that contribute to emergence and dissemination of
resistance cannot be overemphasized, and the lack of basic
knowledge on these topics is one of the primary reasons that
there has been so little signiﬁcant achievement in the effective
prevention and control of resistance development. Most inter-
national, national, and local agencies recognize this serious
problem. Many resolutions and recommendations have been
propounded, and numerous reports have been written, but to
no avail: the development of antibiotic resistance is relentless.
The most striking examples, and probably the most costly in
terms of morbidity and mortality, concern bacteria. The dis-
covery of these infectious agents in the late 19th century stim-
ulated the search for appropriate preventative and therapeutic
regimens; however, successful treatment came only with the
discovery and introduction of antibiotics half a century later.
Antibiotics have revolutionized medicine in many respects, and
countless lives have been saved; their discovery was a turning
point in human history. Regrettably, the use of these wonder
drugs has been accompanied by the rapid appearance of resis-
tant strains. Medical pundits are now warning of a return to the
preantibiotic era; a recent database lists the existence of more
than 20,000 potential resistance genes (r genes) of nearly 400
different types, predicted in the main from available bacterial
genome sequences (85). Fortunately, the number existing as
functional resistance determinants in pathogens is much
smaller.
Many excellent reviews describing the genetics and biochem-
istry of the origins, evolution, and mechanisms of antibiotic
resistance have appeared over the last 60 years. Two of note in
recent times are those of Levy and Marshall (82) and White et
al. (149). The goal of this short article is not to summarize such
a wealth of information but to review the situation as we see it
now (most particularly with respect to the origins and evolu-
tion of resistance genes) and to provide some personal views
on the future of antibiotic therapy of infectious diseases.
Antibiotic discovery, modes of action, and mechanisms of
resistance have been productive research topics in academia
(27) and, until recently, in the pharmaceutical industry. As
natural products, they provide challenging intellectual exer-
cises and surprises with respect to their chemical nature, bio-
synthetic pathways, evolution, and biochemical mode of action
(26, 134). The total synthesis of such natural products in the
laboratory is difﬁcult, since these small molecules are often
extremely complex in functionality and chirality (98). The an-
tibiotic penicillin was discovered in 1928, but the complete
structure of this relatively simple molecule was not revealed
until 1949, by the X-ray crystallographic studies of Dorothy

Crowfoot Hodgkin (73), and was conﬁrmed by total synthesis
in 1959 (125). Studies of modes of action have provided bio-
chemical information on ligands and targets throughout anti-
biotic history (59, 147), and the use of antibiotics as “pheno-
typic mutants” has been a valuable approach in cell physiology
studies (142). The ﬁeld of chemical biology/genetics grew from
studies of those interactions. We have a meager understanding
of how antibiotics work, and in only a few instances can the
intimate interactions of the small molecule and its macromo-
lecular receptor be interpreted in terms of deﬁned phenotypes.
More surprisingly, there is a paucity of knowledge of the nat-
ural biological functions of antibiotics, and the evolutionary
and ecological aspects of their chemical and biological reac-
tions remain topics of considerable interest and value (3, 8).
To begin, the deﬁnition of “antibiotic,” as ﬁrst proposed by
Selman Waksman, the discoverer of streptomycin and a pio-
neer in screening of soils for the presence of biologicals, has
been seriously overinterpreted; it is simply a description of a
use, a laboratory effect, or an activity of a chemical compound
(146). It does not deﬁne a class of compound or its natural
function, only its application. At the risk of attack from purist
colleagues, the generic term “antibiotic” is used here to denote
any class of organic molecule that inhibits or kills microbes by
speciﬁc interactions with bacterial targets, without any consid-
eration of the source of the particular compound or class.
Thus, purely synthetic therapeutics are considered antibiotics;
after all, they interact with receptors and provoke speciﬁc cell
responses and biochemical mechanisms of cross-resistance in
pathogens. The ﬂuoroquinolones (FQs), sulfonamides, and tri-
methoprim are good examples.
As in any ﬁeld of biological study, antibiotic history is replete
with misconceptions, misinterpretations, erroneous predic-
tions, and other mistakes that have occasionally led to the
truth. This account aspires to focus on the truth. The discovery
of antibiotics is rightly considered one of the most signiﬁcant
health-related events of modern times, and not only for its
impact on the treatment of infectious diseases. Studies with
these compounds have often shown unexpected nonantibiotic
effects that indicate a variety of other biological activities; the
result has been a signiﬁcant number of additional therapeutic
applications of “antibiotics” as antiviral, antitumor, or antican-
cer agents. In some cases, the alternative applications have
surpassed those of antibiotic activity in importance, such as in
the treatment of cardiovascular disease or use as immunosup-
pressive agents (45).
Unfortunately, the colossal need for these valuable drugs
has had a signiﬁcant environmental downside. In the 60 years
since their introduction, millions of metric tons of antibiotics
have been produced and employed for a wide variety of pur-
poses. Improvements in production have provided increasingly
less expensive compounds that encourage nonprescription and
off-label uses. The cost of the oldest and most frequently used
antibiotics is (probably) mainly in the packaging. The planet is
saturated with these toxic agents, which has of course contrib-
uted signiﬁcantly to the selection of resistant strains. The de-
velopment of generations of antibiotic-resistant microbes and
their distribution in microbial populations throughout the bio-
sphere are the results of many years of unremitting selection
pressure from human applications of antibiotics, via underuse,
overuse, and misuse. This is not a natural process, but a man-
made situation superimposed on nature; there is perhaps no bet-
ter example of the Darwinian notions of selection and survival.
A LITTLE ANTIBIOTIC HISTORY
Since the introduction in 1937 of the ﬁrst effective antimi-
crobials, namely, the sulfonamides, the development of speciﬁc
mechanisms of resistance has plagued their therapeutic use.
Sulfonamide resistance was originally reported in the late
1930s, and the same mechanisms operate some 70 years later.
A compilation of the commonly used antibiotics, their modes
of action, and resistance mechanisms is shown in Table 1.

Penicillin was discovered by Alexander Fleming in 1928, and in
1940, several years before the introduction of penicillin as a
therapeutic, a bacterial penicillinase was identiﬁed by two
members of the penicillin discovery team (1). Once the anti-
biotic was used widely, resistant strains capable of inactivating
the drug became prevalent, and synthetic studies were under-
taken to modify penicillin chemically to prevent cleavage by
penicillinases (-lactamases). Interestingly, the identiﬁcation
of a bacterial penicillinase before the use of the antibiotic can
now be appreciated in the light of recent ﬁndings that a large
number of antibiotic r genes are components of natural micro-
bial populations (43). Which came ﬁrst, the antibiotic or resis-
tance?
In the case of streptomycin, introduced in 1944 for the treat-
ment of tuberculosis (TB; “The Great White Plague”), mutant
strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to therapeutic
concentrations of the antibiotic were found to arise during
patient treatment. As other antibiotics have been discovered
and introduced into clinical practice, a similar course of events
has ensued. Figure 1 shows the sequence of discovery and
resistance development for the major classes of antibiotics.
The unexpected identiﬁcation of genetically transferable anti-
biotic resistance in Japan in the mid-1950s (initially greeted
with skepticism in the West) (39) changed the whole picture by
introducing the heretical genetic concept that collections of
antibiotic r genes could be disseminated by bacterial conjuga-
tion throughout an entire population of bacterial pathogens
(with a few notable exceptions) (58, 72).
Only in the past few years has it been appreciated that gene
exchange is a universal property of bacteria that has occurred
throughout eons of microbial evolution. The discovery of the
presence of putative bacterial gene sequences in eukaryotic
genomes has heightened awareness of the great importance of
horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in genome evolution. Subse-
quently, other aspects of gene transfer have been revealed by
the identiﬁcation and distribution of genomic islands carrying
genes for pathogenicity (69) and other functional gene clusters
in different bacterial genera. Not surprisingly, plasmid-medi-
ated transfer of antibiotic resistance has been a major focus of
investigation because of its medical and, more recently, prac-
tical signiﬁcance (100).
SUPERBUGS AND SUPERRESISTANCE
Many of the bacterial pathogens associated with epidemics
of human disease have evolved into multidrug-resistant
(MDR) forms subsequent to antibiotic use. For example,
MDR M. tuberculosis is a major pathogen found in both de-
veloping and industrialized nations and became the 20th-cen-
tury version of an old pathogen. Other serious infections
include nosocomial (hospital-linked) infections with Acineto-
bacter baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Campylobacter jejuni,
Citrobacter freundii, Clostridium difﬁcile, Enterobacter spp., En-
terococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Hae-
mophilus inﬂuenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella spp., Serratia spp., Staph-
ylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Stenotrophomo-
nas maltophilia, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The term “su-
perbugs” refers to microbes with enhanced morbidity and
mortality due to multiple mutations endowing high levels of
FIG. 1. History of antibiotic discovery and concomitant development of antibiotic resistance. The dark ages, the preantibiotic era; primordial,
the advent of chemotherapy, via the sulfonamides; golden, the halcyon years when most of the antibiotics used today were discovered; the lean
years, the low point of new antibiotic discovery and development; pharmacologic, attempts were made to understand and improve the use of
antibiotics by dosing, administration, etc.; biochemical, knowledge of the biochemical actions of antibiotics and resistance mechanisms led to
chemical modiﬁcation studies to avoid resistance; target, mode-of-action and genetic studies led to efforts to design new compounds; genomic/HTS,
genome sequencing methodology was used to predict essential targets for incorporation into high-throughput screening assays; disenchantment,
with the failure of the enormous investment in genome-based methods, many companies discontinued their discovery programs. Other milestones
in this history include the creation of the FDA Ofﬁce of New Drugs after the thalidomide disaster led to stricter requirements for drug safety,
including the use of antibiotics. This slowed the registration of novel compounds. Before antibiotics were discovered, Semmelweis advocated hand
washing as a way of avoiding infection; this practice is now strongly recommended as a method to prevent transmission.

resistance to the antibiotic classes speciﬁcally recommended
for their treatment; the therapeutic options for these microbes
are reduced, and periods of hospital care are extended and
more costly. In some cases, superresistant strains have also
acquired increased virulence and enhanced transmissibility.
Realistically, antibiotic resistance can be considered a viru-
lence factor.
Tuberculosis is the archetypical human pathogen; it evolved
with the human race and currently infects as much as one-third
of the world population. While the ground-breaking discover-
ies of streptomycin and isoniazid provided vital treatments,
resistance development was rapid. George Orwell, who suf-
fered from TB while writing the novel 1984, was apparently
infected by an antibiotic-resistant strain of M. tuberculosis
(122). The introduction of cocktails of anti-TB drugs has be-
come an essential treatment regimen, with considerable suc-
cess; however, for a variety of reasons, multidrug resistance
continues to compromise TB therapy throughout the world. M.
tuberculosis strains resistant to four or more of the front-line
treatments (i.e., extremely drug-resistant [XDR] strains) have
appeared and spread rapidly in the last decade or so (124, 130).
And now there are TDR strains, which are totally drug resis-
tant (143)! There have been no validated reports of a role for
HGT in the development of resistance in M. tuberculosis. An-
tibiotic resistance in M. tuberculosis occurs exclusively by spon-
taneous mutation.
The most prevalent Gram-negative pathogens, such as Esch-
erichia coli, Salmonella enterica, and Klebsiella pneumoniae,
cause a variety of diseases in humans and animals, and a strong
correlation between antibiotic use in the treatment of these
diseases and antibiotic resistance development has been ob-
served over the past half-century. This is especially apparent
with the -lactam class of antibiotics and their related inacti-
vating enzymes, the -lactamases. At this time, several groups
and classes have been identiﬁed, comprising up to 1,000 resis-
tance-related -lactamases (Fig. 2). These include novel
classes of genes and their mutant radiations (28, 78, 86, 112,
116). HGT has played a predominant role in the evolution and
transmission of resistance to the -lactam antibiotics among
the enteric bacteria in both community and hospital infections.
Concerning hospital-acquired diseases, Pseudomonas aerugi-
nosa has evolved from being a burn wound infection into a
major nosocomial threat. In this case, again, antibiotic resis-
tance mechanisms evolved coincidentally with the introduction
of new antibiotic derivatives, compromising the most effective
treatments (such as the -lactams and aminoglycosides). P.
aeruginosa is of considerable concern for patients with cystic
ﬁbrosis (76); the pathogen is highly persistent and can avoid
human immune defenses. Resistance development is associ-
ated with the lengthy antibiotic treatment of cystic ﬁbrosis
patients.
Acinetobacter baumannii is a more recent Gram-negative
pathogen and is also primarily nosocomial. As with the pseudo-
monads, it comes equipped with a suite of r genes and patho-
genicity determinants that results in enhanced rates of mortal-
ity and morbidity (107). It is thought that the infectious
properties of Acinetobacter organisms derive from their robust
survival and biodegradation capabilities in the environment; in
addition, many strains are naturally competent for DNA up-
take and have high rates of natural transformation. A. bau-
mannii is evolving rapidly; recent genome sequence studies
showed that some derivatives have at least 28 genomic islands
encoding antibiotic resistance determinants; more than half of
these inserts also encode virulence functions in the form of
type IV secretion systems (14, 64).
Currently, the most notorious superbug is the Gram-positive
organism Staphylococcus aureus. Whether it is the most serious
superbug can be debated, since one wonders to what extent its
bad reputation is due to its extensive press coverage. S. aureus
has a close association with humankind: it is carried as a nasal
commensal in 30% of the population, and its presence has long
been linked to common skin infections such as boils. It does

not have the historical reputation of M. tuberculosis, but in
recent years, this multidrug-resistant pathogen has emerged as
the major nosocomial infection (50). Following the discovery
of penicillin, it seemed that S. aureus infections were control-
lable; however, the respite from resistance was short-lived. The
landmark discovery and introduction of methicillin (the ﬁrst
designer antiresistance antibiotic) in 1959 were thought to be a
sure defense against the penicillinases, but the appearance of
methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) within just 3 years led
inexorably to other multiantibiotic-resistant variants, and the
acronym now denotes multidrug-resistant S. aureus. Relatively
recently, MRSA has moved outside the hospital and become a
major community-acquired (CA) pathogen, with enhanced vir-
ulence and transmission characteristics. CA-MRSA has most
of the properties of MRSA, albeit with different mec gene
clusters, and has acquired new pathogenicity genes, such as the
gene encoding the cytotoxic Panton-Valentine leukocidin (44).
These are regulated by deﬁned signaling systems (101).
A long-recognized hospital denizen, the toxin-producing
anaerobe Clostridium difﬁcile, is increasingly found as the cause
of severe intestinal infections; recently, hypervirulent toxin-
producing strains have been recognized (80, 145). Being a
Gram-positive spore former, it is a hardy organism and is
readily transmitted by hospital personnel, on equipment, and
as aerosols. Its renewed prominence is considered the result of
extensive hospital use of antibiotics such as expanded-spec-
trum cephalosporins, the newer penicillins, and ﬂuoroquinolo-
nes that cause signiﬁcant depletion of the Gram-negative in-
testinal microﬂora, thus enhancing C. difﬁcile colonization. In
other words, these infections are the direct result of antibiotic
use.
Superbugs are omnipresent in the biosphere; their conse-
quences are aggravated enormously in volatile situations such
as civil unrest, violence, famine, and natural disasters and, of
course, by poor or nonexistent hospital practices. Superbugs
are not the only microbial threats, but they are recognized as
the most menacing with respect to morbidity and mortality
worldwide. In terms of the number of infections and conse-
quences, Vibrio cholerae should be at the head of the superbug
list (84). While fortunately it is not common in industrialized
nations, V. cholerae is endemic in Asia and South America.
With respect to the global control of endemic and pandemic
infectious diseases, a signiﬁcant problem is the availability of
reliable systems for tracking outbreaks of serious infections.
Despite the heroic efforts of the World Health Organization,
such reporting is nonexistent in many parts of the world. A lack
of information concerning the early stages of an epidemic
bacterial infection has retarded appropriate remedial action in
many cases.
MECHANISMS AND ORIGINS OF
ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE
The molecular mechanisms of resistance to antibiotics have
been studied extensively (Table 1) and have involved investi-
gations of the genetics and biochemistry of many different
facets of bacterial cell function (2, 59, 147). In fact, the study of
antibiotic action and resistance has contributed signiﬁcantly to
our knowledge of cell structure and function. Resistance pro-
cesses are widely distributed in the microbial kingdom and
have been well described for a variety of commensals (89) and
pathogens; most can be disseminated by one or more distinct
gene transfer mechanisms. A few of the resistance types that
illustrate the difﬁculties in maintaining effective antibiotic ac-
tivity in the face of the genetic and biochemical ﬂexibility of
bacteria deserve special mention.
Genetic Jugglery
The genes for -lactamase enzymes are probably the most
international in distribution; random mutations of the genes
encoding the enzymes have given rise to modiﬁed catalysts with
increasingly extended spectra of resistance (63). The archetypi-
cal plasmid-encoded -lactamase, TEM, has spawned a huge
tribe of related enzyme families, providing ample proof of this
adaptability. The -lactamase genes are ancient (15) and have
been found in remote and desolate environments (4), which
implies that novel -lactamases with altered substrate ranges
occur in the environment. As another example, a new extend-
ed-spectrum -lactamase (CTX-M) was acquired from envi-
ronmental Kluyvera strains and appeared in the clinic in the
1990s; this was the ﬁrst enzyme found to hydrolyze expanded-
spectrum cephalosporins at a clinically signiﬁcant level (86).
The CTX-M genes and subsequent variants (upwards of 100
different amino acid substitutions have been identiﬁed so far)
are highly successful at transmission and are a global phenom-
enon and threat (Fig. 3) (71). Such epidemics of r genes with
efﬁcient HGT and rapid mutational radiation are next to im-
possible to control.
Macrolide antibiotics, such as erythromycin and its succes-
sors, were introduced to contend with the problem of methi-
cillin resistance and are widely used for the treatment of Gram-
positive infections. Not surprisingly, strains resistant due to a
number of different mechanisms are now widely disseminated
(120). The macrolides and related antibiotics act by binding at
different sites in the peptide exit tunnel of the 50S ribosome
subunit. Resistance can occur by modiﬁcation of the RNA or
protein components of the tunnel. A speciﬁc rRNA modiﬁca-
tion that engenders resistance to all antibiotics acting at this
site on the ribosome was described recently (88), and this
modiﬁcation is spreading.
Another example of bacterial genetic jugglery comes from
the recent appearance of a novel FQ resistance mechanism.
When the highly potent FQs were introduced in 1987, a few
foolhardy experts predicted that resistance to this new class of
gyrase inhibitors was unlikely, since at least two mutations
would be required to generate a signiﬁcant resistance pheno-
type. It was also suggested that horizontally transmitted FQ
resistance was unlikely to occur. However, mutants of the tar-
get bacterial gyrase genes and efﬂux of the FQs from the cell
have increasingly been encountered (110). More unexpectedly,
a transmissible mechanism of FQ inactivation has made its
appearance. This mechanism comes about because one of the
many aminoglycoside N-acetyltransferases has the capacity to
modify a secondary amine on the FQs, leading to reduced
activity (46, 99). The latter does not result in high-level FQ
resistance but may impart a low-level tolerance that favors the
selection of resistance mutations (121). Another unpredicted
FQ resistance mechanism is known as Qnr, a widespread
family of DNA-binding proteins (105), and is responsible for

low levels of quinolone resistance (133). We have not heard
the end of the quinolone resistance saga. The moral of the
story . . . one should not try to second-guess microbes! If
resistance is biochemically possible, it will occur.
Intrinsic Resistance
Intrinsic resistance refers to the existence of genes in bacte-
rial genomes that could generate a resistance phenotype, i.e.,
proto- or quasi-resistance. Different genera, species, strains,
etc., exhibit ranges of antibiotic response phenotypes. Since the
beginning of this millennium, the availability of genomewide
mutagenesis techniques and rapid bacterial genome sequenc-
ing has revealed many potential/intrinsic gene functions in
bacteria that may lead to resistance phenotypes in clinical
situations. For example, a common genetic route to enhanced
antibiotic resistance is gene ampliﬁcation, notably for resis-
tance to the sulfonamides (79) and trimethoprim (25). These
studies provide good clues as to what may happen in the future.
Phenotypic analyses of partial or “complete” gene knockout
libraries by saturation mutagenesis of bacterial genomes per-
mit the identiﬁcation of speciﬁc mutants eliciting hypersensi-
tivity responses to antibiotics. It is assumed that overexpression
of the corresponding wild-type gene would generate a resis-
tance phenotype. Such prognostic studies have been carried
out with a number of organisms and have led to the prediction
of novel resistance classes. This type of analysis was ﬁrst done
with a partial mutant library of Acinetobacter baylyi (64). A
more comprehensive survey of the Keio E. coli mutant gene
library identiﬁed a total of 140 distinct isolates that were hy-
persensitive to a range of different antibiotic classes (137);
related studies have been done with Pseudomonas aeruginosa
(51). Many of the putative “susceptibility” genes identiﬁed,
such as genes that are genetically recessive, might not lead to
a resistance phenotype. Nonetheless, such approaches identify
potential r genes and provide information on the systems bi-
ology of resistance. RNA microarray analyses of the effects of
antibiotics have provided similar predictive information
(23). Simply put, increasing the number of copies of the
target genes for an antibiotic can lead to reduction in the
intracellular concentration of the inhibitor as a result of
titration.
Yassin and Mankin used a mutant approach to identify pu-
tative target sites for inhibitors of ribosome function (151).
Studies with rRNA characterized a number of RNA segments
that may be novel targets for small-molecule inhibitors of
translation. Such innovative analyses indicate that in spite of
suggestions to the contrary, many potential drug targets remain
to be exploited in antimicrobial discovery. Predicting resistance
reliably—and acting appropriately—would be a valuable ap-
proach to extending antibiotic lifetimes (91).
The Resistome
It has been known for some time that bacterial strains re-
sistant to antibiotics can be isolated by plating environmental
bacteria on antibiotic-containing media in the laboratory. This
is not surprising for antibiotic-producing actinomycetes, since
most possess genes encoding resistance to the compounds that
they produce. In several cases, the resistance mechanisms have
been identiﬁed and shown to be speciﬁc enzymatic modiﬁca-
tions of the antibiotics. Streptomycetes have long been known
to produce a variety of -lactamases that may well be the
source of some of the clinical forms of -lactam resistance (57,
102). As mentioned earlier, environmental Kluyvera species
have been found to be the origins of the CTX-M genes. In
other cases, resistance of producing organisms to their prod-
ucts has been identiﬁed as due to efﬂux systems (68, 111).

Multiple mechanisms of resistance, as found in the tetracycline
producer Streptomyces rimosus (109), are frequent in produc-
ing bacteria. Based on biochemical and genetic similarities,
such resistance mechanisms have presaged those found subse-
quently in antibiotic-resistant pathogens (18).
In a recent, all-inclusive approach to quantifying the r genes/
phenotype density in the environment, Wright and colleagues
screened a collection of morphologically distinct spore-form-
ing actinomycetes (including many known antibiotic-producing
strains) for resistance to 21 different antibiotics (43). A signif-
icant number of strains were resistant to an average of 7 or 8
antibiotics; they were naturally multidrug resistant. The pop-
ulation of r genes in nature is referred to as the environ-
mental antibiotic resistome (17, 150). Clearly, different en-
vironments would be expected to vary in the number and
type of resistances. Novel resistance mechanisms, as well as
many mechanisms related to those found in pathogens, were
identiﬁed in the collection. This is the best evidence avail-
able for the presence of a vast environmental pool of genes
with the potential to be captured and expressed as resistance
determinants for any overused inhibitor. However, more
studies are necessary to establish a strong environment-
clinic connection (30).
Similar surveys of other antibiotic-producing bacteria, such
as the Bacillaceae, pseudomonads, cyanobacteria, and the ex-
tensive family of Actinobacteria (144), a phylogenetic group
known to produce many low-molecular-weight molecules, will
be valuable in extending our understanding of the nature of r
genes existing in the wild.
The Subsistome
Dantas and coworkers have taken a complementary ap-
proach to that of D’Costa et al. by screening soil bacteria for
biochemical processes that degrade or inactivate antibiotics
(36). Hundreds of strains were randomly isolated from 11
diverse urban and rural soils and tested for the ability to subsist
or grow on one or more of 18 different antibiotics as sole
carbon and nitrogen sources. Perhaps surprisingly, many
strains were isolated that grew efﬁciently on common antimi-
crobials, including aminoglycosides, ﬂuoroquinolones, and
other classes. Most of the strains identiﬁed in this study were
proteobacteria, and more than 40% were Burkholderia spp.;
pseudomonads were also well represented. Obviously, cata-
bolic pathways responsible for antibiotic digestion in nature
provide a rich source of potential resistance determinants;
additional studies should reveal novel mechanisms of resis-
tance to most antibiotic classes. Work on antibiotic-cataboliz-
ing bacteria was reported in the 1970s (53), but the studies of
Dantas and colleagues have exposed the full extent and distri-
bution of degradation/r genes in the environment and further
veriﬁed the roles played by reservoirs of soil bacteria as origins
of antibiotic r genes.
Metagenomic Analyses of Environmental Samples
Cloning, PCR, and gene expression techniques have been
applied to detect natural r genes in random recombinant
clones derived from bacterial DNA libraries from soils and
sediments (3, 119). A potential problem is that the identiﬁca-
tion of functional resistance requires gene expression (tran-
scription and translation) of the cloned genes in a heterologous
host; to date, only E. coli has been used. Some r genes were
identiﬁed, but one wonders how many would have been found
using a wider range of expression systems and hosts; subse-
quent global sequencing approaches by D’Costa et al. (43) and
Dantas et al. (36) indicate that the number would have been
large. Taken together, these studies conﬁrm the existence of
many potential antibiotic r genes and mechanisms in nature.
Many questions remain. The roles of these environmental
reservoirs in clinical resistance development are still hypothet-
ical, and the primary metabolic functions of proto-/quasi-r
genes in microbial populations are as yet unknown. We have
little or no evidence that any of the putative r genes identiﬁed
in these environmental studies have been mobilized into
pathogenic bacteria and expressed as resistance phenotypes. If
concentrations of antibiotic compounds are essentially unde-
tectable in natural environments, what are the selective pres-
sures for the variety of r genes?
Resistance Due to Anthropogenic Activities
The predominant role of human activities in the generation
of environmental reservoirs of antibiotic resistance cannot be
disputed. Since the 1940s, ever-increasing amounts of antibi-
otics designated for human applications have been manufac-
tured, used clinically, released into the environment, and
widely disseminated, thus providing constant selection and
maintenance pressure for populations of resistant strains in all
environments. Obtaining accurate ﬁgures on the quantities of
antimicrobials produced by the pharmaceutical industry is dif-
ﬁcult (it is not in the best interest of pharmaceutical companies
to provide this information), but it can be estimated that many
millions of metric tons of antibiotic compounds have been
released into the biosphere over the last half-century. Since the
only available evidence indicates that little in the way of anti-
biotics is contributed by naturally occurring antibiotic-produc-
ing strains in their native environments (65), we must assume
that commercial production provides the vast bulk of the an-
tibiotics found in the biosphere. Some alternative uses of an-
timicrobial agents are as follows: (i) growth promotion/prophyl-
actic use in animals; (ii) therapeutic/prophylactic use in
humans; (iii) therapeutic/prophylactic use in aquaculture; (iv)
therapeutic/prophylactic use in household pets; (v) pest con-
trol/cloning for plants and agriculture; (vi) use as biocides in
toiletries and in hand care and household cleaning products;
and (vii) culture sterility, cloning, and selection in research and
industry. It should be noted that therapeutic use in humans
accounts for less than half of all applications of antibiotics
produced commercially.
Taking into consideration the large-scale disposal of toxic
wastes, metals, disinfectants, biocides, and residues of manu-
facturing processes, the amounts of noxious xenobiotics re-
leased into the biosphere are inestimable. The fact that many
of the chemicals disposed are recalcitrant to biodegradation
only compounds the issue. The dumping of ciproﬂoxacin into
rivers at levels in excess of 50 kg a day by pharmaceutical
manufacturers in Hyderabad, in central India (54), is possibly
the most extreme of the horror stories concerning irresponsi-
ble disposal; however, similar levels of pollution probably oc-

cur (unreported) elsewhere in the world. Quite apart from
providing powerful selection for the formation of resistant
strains in all bacterial genera (this information has not yet been
published), physiological damage to local resident populations
of insects, birds, animals, and humans cannot be overestimated
(31).
Numerous types of anthropogenic activity, including antibi-
otic use in agriculture and aquaculture, other nonhuman ap-
plications of antibiotics, and waste disposal, create major en-
vironmental reserves of resistance (Fig. 4) (49) and, quite
probably, of virulence genes and the organisms that harbor
them (95). As other examples, genetic and genomic studies of
wastewater treatment plants have shown that they are rich
reservoirs of r genes and resistant organisms (123, 136); the
genes are frequently carried as genomic islands on transmissi-
ble plasmids and provide ready sources of resistance determi-
nants. Do these populations have any relationship with resis-
tance in hospitals? Such treatment plants, established for the
common good, have become the common bad (13, 34). Steps
to ensure better control of antibiotic release and environmen-
tal disposal from all users should be immediate and obligatory.
Interesting conundrums have been encountered in investi-
gations of links between antibiotic use and the development of
antibiotic resistance. Recent studies have uncovered the pres-
ence of antibiotic r genes and even resistance-encoding inte-
grons in the gut ﬂora of peoples who live in isolated areas
apparently untouched by modern civilization and not exposed
to antibiotic therapies (16, 103, 104). Where did the r genes
come from?
GENETICS OF RESISTANCE
The appearance and dissemination of antibiotic-resistant
pathogens have stimulated countless studies of the genetic
aspects of the different phenomena associated with resistance
development, such as gene pickup, heterologous expression,
HGT, and mutation (29, 58, 149). The genetics of plasmids is
not discussed in any detail here, nor are the interactions be-
tween plasmid-encoded and chromosomal resistances, except
to say that early preconceptions about the stability, ubiquity,
and host ranges of r genes and their vectors have largely be-
come ﬁction. For example, acquisition of resistance has long
been assumed to incur a serious energy cost to the microor-
ganism, and indeed, many resistant mutants may be growth
limited under laboratory conditions. As a result, it was consid-
ered that multidrug-resistant strains would be unstable and
short-lived in the absence of selection (10). However, as fre-
quently demonstrated, laboratory conditions (especially cul-

ture media) do not duplicate real-life circumstances; available
evidence suggests that pathogens with multiple mutations and
combinations of r genes evolve and survive successfully in vivo.
Two recent studies of the development of multimutant, mul-
tidrug-resistant S. aureus and M. tuberculosis provide examples
that overturn earlier beliefs. In the ﬁrst study, isolates from a
hospitalized patient treated with vancomycin were sampled at
frequent intervals after hospital admission and analyzed by
genome sequencing. In the steps to the development of the
ﬁnal (mortal) isolate, 35 mutations could be identiﬁed over the
course of 3 months (96)! Similarly, it has been reported that
genome sequencing of antibiotic-resistant strains of M. tuber-
culosis revealed 29 independent mutations in an MDR strain
and 35 mutations in an XDR strain. The functions of these
mutations are not understood; they could well be compensa-
tory changes. Such studies emphasize the need for detailed
systems biology analyses of resistance development in situ.
Resistance Gene Transmission
Essentially any of the accessory genetic elements found in
bacteria are capable of acquiring r genes and promoting their
transmission; the type of element involved varies with the ge-
nus of the pathogen. There are similarities but also clear dif-
ferences between the Gram-positive and Gram-negative bac-
teria; nonetheless, plasmid-mediated transmission is far and
away the most common mechanism of HGT (100). Surpris-
ingly, bacteriophages carrying antibiotic r genes have rarely
been identiﬁed in the environment or in hospital isolates of
resistant bacteria; however, there is no question about the
association of phages with the insertional mechanisms required
for the formation of mobile resistance elements and with the
functions of chromosomally associated r genes. They are fre-
quently seen as phage “ﬁngerprints” ﬂanking genes encoding
resistance or virulence on different vectors. It appears that
such events are quite common in S. aureus (127).
Gene transmission by conjugation has been studied exten-
sively in the laboratory and in microcosms approximating en-
vironmental conditions, and the frequencies of the transfer
events often vary signiﬁcantly. Experiments suggest that fre-
quencies of conjugative transmission in nature are probably
several orders of magnitude higher than those under labora-
tory conditions (129). It has been shown that transfer in the
intestinal tracts of animals and humans occurs ad libitum (126);
it’s a bordello down there! Recent studies have demonstrated
diverse antibiotic r genes in the human gut microbiome (128).
In the streptococci, meningococci, and related genera, the
exchange of both virulence and pathogenicity genes is highly
promiscuous; the principal mechanism for DNA trafﬁc appears
to be transformation (52, 70, 131). Finally, with respect to
direct DNA acquisition in the environment, Acinetobacter spp.
are naturally competent, and HGT is frequent (14); pathogenic
strains typically carry large genomic islands (83, 108). Might
Acinetobacter and related environmental genera play roles in
the capture and passage of r genes from environment to clinic?
Such processes surely involve multiple steps and intermediate
bacterial strains, but it has been suggested that heterogeneous
gene exchange occurs readily in networks of multihost inter-
actions (48).
Horizontal gene transfer has occurred throughout evolution-
ary history, and one can consider two independent sets of
events, largely differentiated by their time span and the
strength of selection pressure. What happened during the evo-
lution of bacteria and other microbes and organisms over sev-
eral billions of years cannot be compared to the phenomenon
of antibiotic resistance development and transfer over the last
century. Contemporary selection pressure of antibiotic use and
disposal is much more intense; selection is largely for survival
in hostile environments rather than for traits providing ﬁtness
in slowly evolving populations.
Consistent with the concept of the recent evolution of anti-
biotic resistance plasmids and multiresistant strains, studies
with collections of bacterial pathogens isolated before the “an-
tibiotic era” showed that plasmids were common but r genes
were rare (38). Genome sequence analyses of environmental
microbes revealed that they are replete with plasmids—mostly
large and often carrying multigene pathways responsible for
the biodegradation of xenobiotic molecules, such as the poly-
chlorinated phenolic compounds that have been used and dis-
tributed widely since the days of the industrial revolution. In
summary, what is occurring in our lifetimes is an evolutionary
process intensiﬁed by anthropogenic inﬂuences rather than the
slower, random course of natural evolution. The existing pro-
cesses of gene acquisition, transfer, modiﬁcation, and expres-
sion that were in place are expanding and accelerating in the
modern biosphere.
Laboratory studies have characterized numerous genetic
mechanisms implicated in the evolution of antibiotic-resistant
populations; the roles of plasmids, phages, and transformation
are well established, but other processes may exist. For exam-
ple, bacterial cell-cell fusion might be favored in complex
mixed microbial communities, such as those found in bioﬁlms
(61). The efﬁciency of the processes is not critical; selection
and the efﬁciency of heterologous gene expression are likely
the most important constraints. However, low-level expression
of a potential r gene in a new host may provide partial protec-
tion from an antagonist (5); subsequent gene tailoring by mu-
tation with selection would lead to improved expression. Pro-
moter function under environmental conditions is not well
understood (32); it appears that promoters of Gram-positive
origin can function well in Gram-negative bacteria but that the
converse is not often true. Does this imply a favored direction
for bacterial gene transfer, as Brisson-Noe¨l et al. have sug-
gested (24)? During therapeutic use, the exposure of bacterial
pathogens to high concentrations of antibiotics for extended
periods creates severe selection pressure and leads to higher
levels of resistance. The pathway from an environmental gene
to a clinical r gene is not known, but it obviously occurs with
some facility. Knowledge of the intermediate steps in this im-
portant process would be revealing—how many steps are there
from source to clinic?
In the laboratory, HGT occurs under a variety of conditions
and can be enhanced by physical means that facilitate DNA
exchange, for example, physical proximity by immobilization
on a ﬁlter or agar surface, and there are likely numerous other
environmental factors that promote gene uptake. It is worth
noting that antibiotics, especially at subinhibitory concentra-
tions, may facilitate the process of antibiotic resistance devel-
opment (41). For example, they have been shown to enhance
gene transfer and recombination (35), in part through activat-

ing the SOS system (66, 67); in addition, antimicrobials have
been shown to induce phage production from lysogens. Such
factors may play important roles in enhancing the frequency of
gene exchange in environments such as farms, hospitals, and
sewage systems, which provide ideal incubation conditions for
r gene acquisition.
On the positive side, it should be noted that studies of
antibiotic resistance mechanisms and their associated gene
transfer mechanisms in pathogens have played seminal roles in
the development of recombinant DNA methods, providing the
experimental foundation for the modern biotechnology indus-
try (72). The use of restriction enzymes and plasmid cloning
techniques completely transformed biology. The subsequent
extension of bacterial recombinant DNA methods to plant,
animal, and human genetic manipulations required only minor
technical modiﬁcations, such as the construction of appropri-
ate bifunctional antibiotics and cognate r genes in pro- and
eukaryotes. The applications are truly universal, with increas-
ingly evident beneﬁts to all aspects of pure and applied biology.
Integrons
Integrons are unusual gene acquisition elements that were
ﬁrst identiﬁed and characterized by Stokes and Hall in 1987
(132); retrospective analyses have indicated that they were
associated with the r genes present in the Shigella isolates that
characterized the ﬁrst wave of transferable plasmid-mediated
resistance in Japan in the 1950s (83). The “Japanese” plasmids
were studied for some 30 years before the integron structure
was identiﬁed, although resistance determinant components
were identiﬁed early as composite elements of the plasmids.
Figure 5 shows the structure of an integron, its essential func-
tions, and its resistance determinants. Integrons are not them-
selves mobile genetic elements but can become so in associa-
tion with a variety of transfer and insertion functions (74).
They are critical intermediates in the pickup and expression of
r genes (the upstream promoter is highly efﬁcient) and are the
source of the majority of the transferable antibiotic r genes
found in gammaproteobacteria (60). Recently, it was demon-
strated that the process of integron gene capture and expres-
sion is activated by the SOS system (37, 66, 67). In a broader
view, increasing evidence suggests that components such as
integrons and their gene cassettes played important roles in
genome evolution and ﬂuidity within the bacterial kingdom
(21, 93).
There have been many excellent reviews on the topic of
integrons. The complete three-dimensional structure of an in-
tegrase has been determined, and the mechanism of r gene
cassette acquisition is now well understood (22). Well over 100
cassettes have been identiﬁed, covering all the major classes of
antibiotics (118). There is functional and genomic evidence
that these elements, long thought to be exclusive to Gram-
negative bacteria, are present in Gram-positive bacteria as well
(97); however, a general role for integrons in antibiotic resis-
tance development in Gram-positive bacteria remains to be
established. Most striking is the discovery of very large num-
bers of integron cassettes in natural environments that do not
code for (known) resistance characters. These ﬁndings came
from high-throughput sequencing of soil metagenomic DNAs
and from PCR analyses of DNA samples isolated from diverse
soils, sediments, and other natural environments by use of
integron-integrase-speciﬁc primers (62). Metagenomic analy-
ses of bacterial populations from hospitals, agricultural sites,
wastewater
treatment
plants,
and
similar
environmental
sources have revealed many complete integrons with r gene
cassettes, underlining the universal importance of integron-
mediated gene pickup in resistance evolution. The origins of
integrons are not known, although the similarity of sequence
between the integrases and bacteriophage recombinases sug-
gests an evolutionary relationship.
Finally, it should be noted that the evolution of different
FIG. 5. Integron structure and gene capture mechanism. This ﬁgure indicates the basic elements of integrons, as found in bacterial genomes.
The structure consists of an integrase (Int) with the Pint and PC promoters in the 3 end of the gene, with its associated cassette attachment or
insertion site (attI). The integrase catalyzes the sequential recombination of circularized gene cassettes into the distal attachment site to create an
operon-like arrangement (ant1r, ant2r, and so on) of r genes transcribed from the strong PC promoter (132). Three classes of integrons have been
identiﬁed that differ in their integrase genes.

types of antibiotic resistance elements in different clinical and
natural environments probably involves a variety of integrated
genetic processes. Other acquisition and transfer mechanisms
have been identiﬁed, and the combinatorial nature of the pro-
cess of resistance development should not be underestimated
(46, 139, 148).
ECOLOGICAL ROLES OF ANTIBIOTICS AND
ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE
Putative antibiotic r genes are omnipresent in natural envi-
ronments. This raises the question of their natural functions, a
topic that has been the subject of several thought-provoking
reviews (3, 9, 90). Do they determine antibiotic resistance
phenotypes in nature? Are these genes maintained for resis-
tance or for unrelated genetic or biochemical needs? Can we
assume that bacteria are constantly exposed to a wide variety
of toxins or otherwise inhibitory molecules in the environ-
ment? What are the ecological roles of low-molecular-weight
natural products identiﬁed to have antibiotic activity in the
laboratory? They have numerous sources, such as products of
the degradation of natural polymers in nutrient conversions,
plant products, antibiotic compounds from insects and fungi,
and general organic decay. Plants produce many compounds
that inhibit bacterial growth in the rhizosphere.
In addition, the environment contains many products that
are man-made and/or triggered by human contamination, e.g.,
petroleum chemicals, solvents, the products and waste of in-
dustrial processes, garbage, etc. Since the beginnings of the
industrial revolution, humankind has dumped ever-increasing
amounts of organic and inorganic toxins into streams, rivers,
seas, oceans, land, and air. Heavy metals are frequently present
in soils. Arsenic, mercury, and iodine were used industrially
and, prior to the discovery of antibiotics, as medicinals; under
some circumstances, they are still employed as such. The major
bacterial solution to toxic challenges takes the form of multi-
valent pumping systems that prevent intracellular accumula-
tion of structurally diverse bactericidal and bacteriostatic sub-
stances
(111,
113).
Actinomycetes
and
other
microbes
producing antibiotics and bioactive small molecules invariably
possess multiple efﬂux systems (94), as demonstrated for the
tetracycline-producing organism Streptomyces rimosus (109).
The coexistence of production and resistance functions has
been conﬁrmed extensively in recent studies of antibiotic bio-
synthetic gene clusters and examinations of the genome se-
quences from producing strains (33, 42).
With the exception of nonspeciﬁc efﬂux systems, the poten-
tial antibiotic resistance determinants found in antibiotic-pro-
ducing strains are generally associated with structural types or
modes of action. It has been suggested that these resistance
mechanisms are for “self-protection” of the host, on the as-
sumption that the producer would self-destruct if it started to
make its antibiotic product (75). However, this notion has not
been proven.
The production of an antibiotic in the laboratory is routinely
assayed by inhibitory activity against bacterial strains of labo-
ratory or clinical origin. Because traditional inhibition assays
showed that they are produced late in the growth phase of the
microbe, antibiotics have been called “secondary metabolites”;
they appear to play no role in normal growth of the host. In
addition, the so-called secondary compounds appear to be
produced at undetectable concentrations in early exponential
phases of growth. Laboratory studies indicate that streptomy-
cetes producing small molecules pass through a transition
phase during growth in ﬂask cultures that is associated with the
onset of signiﬁcant developmental changes, including sporula-
tion and antibiotic production. Such interpretations of the re-
lationship of growth-associated processes to small-molecule
production may apply only under laboratory and industrial
conditions.
The quasi-r genes associated with small-molecule biosyn-
thetic clusters could have other metabolic and regulatory pro-
cesses. Antibiotic resistance is highly pleiotropic in character.
Is it possible that other selective pressures—the expression of
efﬂux or inﬂux systems, for example—might lead to strains
resistant to an antibiotic? Pleiotropic interactions can also de-
rive from changes in the distributed metabolic pathways that
are networked in cells; an alteration in the concentration of
one enzyme or protein could lead to adjustments in processes
concerned with microbial community networking (141).
Mutations in ribosomal protein genes leading to antibiotic
resistance have a number of extraribosomal effects (mistrans-
lation, temperature sensitivity, phage propagation, etc.) that
inﬂuence cell function. Different selective pressures may lead
to mutations that coincidentally confer a level of antibiotic
resistance. An antibiotic resistance phenotype does not neces-
sarily occur solely in response to antibiotic selection.
Whether the microbial products identiﬁed to have antibiotic
activity do function as antibiotics in natural environments is a
moot question. As mentioned earlier, the word “antibiotic”
was coined by soil microbiologist Selman Waksman, the Nobel
Prize-winning discoverer of streptomycin. He and his distin-
guished team of researchers (including Mary and Hubert Lech-
evalier and Boyd Woodruff) isolated hundreds of actinomyce-
tes from different soils and subsequently identiﬁed compounds
with antibiotic activity in the laboratory (streptothricin, neo-
mycin, actinomycin D, etc.). These discoveries were the genesis
of the antibiotic industry. Waksman described an antibiotic as
“a compound produced by a microbe that kills or inhibits the
growth of another microbe.” Subsequently, he must have re-
alized that this was an anthropocentric viewpoint, for he stated
that “one is forced to conclude that antibiotics play no role in
modifying or inﬂuencing the living processes that exist in na-
ture” (146). Unfortunately, the word “antibiotic” had become
ﬁxed, deﬁning both compounds and activities. All low-molec-
ular-weight inhibitors from nature were called antibiotics.
Over the last century, studies of microbial natural product
function have been predicated on “useful” clinical applications
or chemistry. Cellular targets (receptors) have been identiﬁed
and detailed studies of the biochemistry of inhibitory action
carried out (59). However, biological and ecological consider-
ations of the roles of these compounds have been rare. In the
case of compounds with antibiotic activity, the principal inter-
est was the MIC, an anthropocentric concept if ever there was
one. Some efforts were made to detect antibiotic activity in soil
environments (65); however, the fact that the results were
negative was possibly a disappointment but was of no concern.
In recent times, studies of microbes in natural environments
have provided drastically altered concepts of the natural life-
styles and functions of bacteria (for example, they do not grow

as isolated, single colonies in the wild), and questions have
been asked about the possible roles of the large number of
bioactive microbial compounds that are produced. Although
the ability to isolate single bacterial colonies on agar was crit-
ical to bacterial identiﬁcation and the study of pathogenicity,
this practice has actually delayed the development of microbial
ecology. Nowadays, emphasis is being placed on investigations
of the interactions within complex bacterial communities (mi-
crobiomes) in different environments, as many diseases occur
as the result of polymicrobial infections.
Considering again the ubiquity of the quasi-r genes found in
nature, if antibiosis is not a common function, what are the roles
of these genes? It is well known that antibiotic activity is only one
of the biological properties of bioactive small molecules. They
exhibit extensive pleiotropy/multifunctionality and most likely are
involved in cell-cell signaling within and between bacteria and
other organisms in the environment (fungi, plants, insects, and
even human and animal hosts). Do the quasi-resistance mecha-
nisms provide the means for attenuating cell-cell interactions,
natural degradation pathways, or other functions (41)? Penicilli-
nases have been implicated in cell wall turnover (77, 140). Efﬂux
pumps are promiscuous, and a variety of low-molecular-weight
compounds with limited structural similarities may be substrates
for the same pump (113).
The Parvome (the World of Small Molecules)
The main conclusion to be derived from the previous dis-
cussion is that there is lamentable ignorance of the roles of
many millions of low-molecular-weight organic compounds
that are produced by bacteria, other microbes, and plants.
Their production requires well-deﬁned biochemical pathways
and involves biosynthetic gene clusters that are frequently
larger than 100 kb. The study of the myriad aspects of small-
molecule biology deserves attention. As a collective noun for
the inﬁnite world of bioactive small molecules (usually less
than 3,000 Da) produced by living organisms, we have coined
the word “parvome,” a combination of parv- (Greek preﬁx:
small) and -ome (Latin sufﬁx: group).
To start, answers are needed to key ecological questions. What
are the origins of small bioactive organic molecules such as anti-
biotics? What are the natural roles of these compounds? An even
more intriguing question concerns the evolution of the complex
biosynthetic pathways of all the bioactive compounds produced in
nature. The structural components of antibiotics appear to have
existed in the biosphere for billions of years, as evidenced by the
number of primordial amino acid derivatives (many of them com-
ponents of nonribosomal peptides) found in meteorites and by
products from “prebiotic” reaction conditions (40). Baltz has cal-
culated that the biosynthetic pathway for a polyketide molecule
such as erythromycin may have evolved as many as 800 million
years ago (12), and the streptomycin biosynthetic pathway is at
least 600 million years old.
HOW TO CONTROL OR REDUCE ANTIBIOTIC
RESISTANCE DEVELOPMENT
By any consideration, the most serious consequence of the
use of antibiotics is the concomitant development of resistant
strains; this has prompted continuous efforts to exert control
over antibiotic usage. Erythromycin was an early example; in-
troduced as an alternative to penicillin for the treatment of S.
aureus in Boston City Hospital in the early 1950s, it was com-
pletely withdrawn after less than a year because 70% of all the
S. aureus isolates were found to have become erythromycin
resistant. The same was observed with chlortetracycline and
chloramphenicol and, subsequently, with other antibiotics (55).
It is clear that antibiotic resistance seems inevitable. What
steps can be taken to prevent or at least delay this process?
Over the years, many different solutions have been proposed
by knowledgeable experts and all the major international
health groups (e.g., WHO and the CDC). Among the propos-
als for action are strict controls on antibiotic use by humans,
requiring accurate prescriptions (no use of antibiotics to treat
colds and other viral infections), no delivery of antibiotics
without a doctor’s prescription (reducing needless use of anti-
biotics), and controlled therapeutic use in animal husbandry
and agriculture. Interestingly, the Swann recommendations of
1969 (135) were the ﬁrst to call for a ban on nontherapeutic use
in animals and agriculture, a reasonable but highly contentious
suggestion that has been impossible to enforce in many coun-
tries to this day. Deception has played a role in this failure;
many of the antimicrobials approved for treatment of humans
are given to animals under the cover of different names for
different uses, as described in the Report of the Advisory Com-
mittee on Animal Antimicrobial Use Data Collection in the
United States of the Alliance for the Prudent Use of Antibiotics
(47). Although the Netherlands and Scandinavia have success-
fully reduced resistance levels, it is clear that restriction of
antibiotic use is difﬁcult to implement on a global scale. Uni-
versal adherence to the suggested rules for restraint could have
a positive effect, but would resistance be eliminated? Almost
certainly not. See the most recent report (of many), Antibiotic
Resistance: an Ecological Perspective on an Old Problem (6).
However, if well-considered restrictions and rules for usage
were supported by a pipeline of structurally novel antibiotics
and semisynthetics designed to be refractory to resistance
mechanisms, one could expect some signiﬁcant and lasting
improvements in the treatment of infectious diseases.
Past history provides recurrent warnings. Following its in-
troduction in the United States in the 1950s, penicillin was
available over the counter for almost 10 years before prescrip-
tions were required. Thus, we can assume that a “core” pop-
ulation of antibiotic-resistant strains was established by the
early 1960s in most industrialized nations. Transmission of
plasmid-encoded resistance mechanisms that developed during
that period contributed to international dissemination.
The situation today is clearly more complex. In many devel-
oping nations, antibiotic use is relatively uncontrolled. Com-
monly used antimicrobials are comparatively inexpensive in
these nations (often costing 10- to 30-fold less than the same
drugs in industrialized nations, although they are not neces-
sarily of the same purity or authenticity). In addition, it has
been customary for western pharmaceutical companies to dis-
tribute antibiotics that are no longer effective or not approved
in Europe or North America to developing nations.
On the side of success, mode-of-action-guided chemical
modiﬁcations of compounds such as aminoglycosides, -lac-

known resistance mechanisms. However, the target for resis-
tance function cannot be modiﬁed or removed completely
without affecting antibiotic activity. Novel semisynthetic com-
pounds generated by such chemical modiﬁcations of antibiotic
core structures have extended the useful life of several classes,
such as methicillin (oxacillin), the macrolide azithromycin, and
the modiﬁed aminoglycoside amikacin, among others. But this
approach does little more than buy time. The r genes evolve in
response to new selection pressures, and since multiple mech-
anisms of resistance exist for every class of antibiotic, the
avoidance of each and every modiﬁcation is impossible. In
addition, in some cases, chemical modiﬁcation of antimicrobi-
als has led to enhanced toxicity.
As mentioned earlier, the ability to pump antibiotics out of
cells is a common feature of most environmental microbes and
their pathogenic relatives and is the most widespread form of
resistance to most classes of antibiotics. Devising compounds
that interfere with efﬂux of active inhibitors from the cell is an
attractive strategy for the design of modiﬁed or combination
therapeutics (87, 111). Unfortunately, in spite of considerable
effort, very few effective compounds have been obtained, and
only one or two have come close to market. This approach is
clearly viable, but for the time being, it remains little more than
a pipe dream.
Over the years, there has been much discussion of “cycling”
antibiotics to try to reduce selection pressures for resistance
and thus prolong the useful life of compounds; this involves the
periodic replacement of front-line antibiotics with alternative
structural classes in hospitals (19, 92). Cycling does not provide
a long-term solution, however, since resistant strains never
disappear from the resident population; when related antibi-
otics are reintroduced, the problem strains (or r genes) are
quickly reselected. In large hospital complexes, it may be dif-
ﬁcult to decontaminate the “infected” intensive care centers
appropriately while cycling between different antibiotics. Has
this approach been given a fair test? What might the experi-
ence be in more easily controlled situations?
A related tactic involves treatment with combinations of
inhibitory compounds that have different modes of action. This
combinatorial approach (a ﬂuoroquinolone plus a macrolide
or a -lactam plus an aminoglycoside or tetracycline) has been
used in the past to overcome resistance and has also been
applied with success in the treatment of diseases such as cancer
and HIV infection. However, detailed pharmacodynamic in-
formation is essential, and regulatory issues need to be re-
solved before standardized combinations of antibiotics can be
used in routine practice. For example, how does one guarantee
that in a mix of two or more active compounds, all arrive at the
site of infection at the predetermined concentration range for
maximum synergy (and not simply additive effects)? Nonethe-
less, with seriously life-threatening infections in hospitals, dras-
tic measures must be taken, and a variety of antibiotic combi-
nations are frequently used. Is it possible that older and/or
unused (or even discarded) antibiotics might be rehabilitated
for “last-resort” use in rational combinations to overcome mul-
tidrug-resistant bacterial infections, as some studies have sug-
gested (152)?
Many strategies for avoiding, inhibiting, or bypassing resis-
tance mechanisms in pathogens have been attempted. The
most notable successes in such endeavors have been with the
-lactam antibiotics. Clavulanic acid and related compounds
are potent inhibitors of -lactamase enzymes and are fre-
quently used in combination with the -lactam antibiotics.
These combinations have been highly effective (117), but bac-
teria have found a way to outsmart us: a number of -lacta-
mases that are refractory to inhibition by clavulanate have
appeared (138). To date, research to extend this approach to
other classes of antibiotics has not been successful. This poses
another interesting ecological question—given that -lactama-
ses are common in nature, what are the roles of the natural
-lactamase inhibitors, such as clavulanic acid?
It has also been proposed that inhibitors of bacterial viru-
lence could be used to arrest the disease process and thus do
away with the requirement for antibiotics. This elegant solu-
tion appears to have an advantage over antibiosis in that se-
lection for resistance (survival in the host) might not occur
because the growth of the infecting organism would not be
impaired. Some success has been obtained in small-animal
models, but more extensive studies are essential if this therapy
is to be validated (11). Other nonantibiotic approaches for the
treatment of bacterial diseases involve stimulation or recruit-
ment of the innate immune system of the host (56). Recent
advances in our understanding of the roles of the human gut
microbiome in innate immunity may lead to other therapeutic
options (115).
This review has ignored (among other things) one of the
major aspects of the control of bacterial diseases, i.e., preven-
tion. In an ideal world with effective vaccines against all infec-
tious diseases, the use of antibiotics would be reduced drasti-
cally and hopefully limited to surgical procedures in hospitals
under strict controls. However, despite years of effort, there
are few widely used antibacterial vaccines (7). The success of
the pneumococcal vaccine is a model of what can be achieved.
Can one hope that more extensive and focused efforts will
make it possible to create reliable vaccines effective against E.
coli, V. cholerae, S. aureus, Acinetobacter, and others?
CONCLUSIONS
The importance and value of antibiotics cannot be overes-
timated; we are totally dependent on them for the treatment of
infectious diseases, and they should never be considered mere
commodities. In addition to their use in the treatment of in-
fectious diseases, antibiotics are critical to the success of ad-
vanced surgical procedures, including organ and prosthetic
transplants.
Notwithstanding all good intentions to control antibiotic us-
age (but limited action), there is little doubt that the situation
with respect to antibiotic resistance is grim. Resistance mech-
anisms are pandemic and create an enormous clinical and
ﬁnancial burden on health care systems worldwide. There are
no simple solutions to the problem. Decisive actions that re-
quire signiﬁcant commitment and enforcement are never pop-
ular, even if lives can be saved. Fortunately, not all bacterial
pathogens are resistant all of the time, and many respond to
empirical treatment with antimicrobial agents administered in
the community. Success is perhaps due to luck rather than to
good judgment.
Given the many imponderables, the best one can expect is
that all physicians and health care centers provide their pa-

tients with environments that are resistance-free by taking
stricter measures in infection control and antibiotic use. This
must be backed up by efforts to prevent dumping of antibiotics
into the environment through sewer systems; complete de-
struction of antibiotics before disposal should be common
practice.
It is vital that there should be absolutely no letup in the
search for new antimicrobial agents (20). Despite the negative
attitude of big pharma, the microbial parvome is nowhere near
being exhausted in the search for new antimicrobials. Likewise,
many uninvestigated drug targets exist in bacterial pathogens.
Current knowledge of inhibitor-target and inhibitor-resistance
interactions is not at the point where effective new compounds
can be designed or screened with conﬁdence; more studies of
these processes at the structural level will surely provide new
leads. Systems biology approaches are uncovering new types of
metabolic interactions and providing nonreductionist explana-
tions for many aspects of antibiotic modes of action and resis-
tance (81, 152). With increasing application of such interactive
genome-associated studies, it can be anticipated that new and
valid targets will be identiﬁed and tested for inhibitor re-
sponses by proper consideration of both the direct and indirect
functions of genes. The tragedy is that most pharmaceutical
companies are now shirking the responsibilities of their own
business missions. The onus is on academia to furnish infor-
mation on the multifunctional aspects of microbial network
interactions that will provide the discovery tools of the future.
There is no perfect antibiotic, and once the most appropri-
ate uses of any new compound are identiﬁed, it is essential that
prescription of the antibiotic be restricted to those uses. This
means that deﬁned “niche” antibiotics should be developed as
a class separate from broad-spectrum agents. Given the in-
creasing knowledge of environmental reservoirs of resistance,
it should now be possible to have early warning of potential
resistance mechanisms to new or old antibiotics and thus pre-
pare for problems in the clinic in a proactive manner. It is
incumbent on us to renew a concerted offensive that takes full
advantage of new understanding and technologies (12, 106,
114). If not, the preantibiotic era awaits our descendants.
