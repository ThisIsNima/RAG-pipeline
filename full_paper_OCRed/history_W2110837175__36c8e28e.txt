INTRODUCTION
“Eat leeks in March and wild garlic in May,
and all the year after the physicians may play.”
Traditional Welsh rhyme (230)
“An apple a day keeps the doctor away.”
Traditional American rhyme
Finding healing powers in plants is an ancient idea. People
on all continents have long applied poultices and imbibed
infusions of hundreds, if not thousands, of indigenous plants,
dating back to prehistory. There is evidence that Neanderthals
living 60,000 years ago in present-day Iraq used plants such as
hollyhock (211, 224); these plants are still widely used in eth-
nomedicine around the world. Historically, therapeutic results
have been mixed; quite often cures or symptom relief resulted.
Poisonings occurred at a high rate, also. Currently, of the
one-quarter to one-half of all pharmaceuticals dispensed in the
United States having higher-plant origins, very few are in-
tended for use as antimicrobials, since we have relied on bac-
terial and fungal sources for these activities. Since the advent
of antibiotics in the 1950s, the use of plant derivatives as
antimicrobials has been virtually nonexistent.
Clinical microbiologists have two reasons to be interested in
the topic of antimicrobial plant extracts. First, it is very likely
that these phytochemicals will ﬁnd their way into the arsenal of
antimicrobial drugs prescribed by physicians; several are al-
ready being tested in humans (see below). It is reported that,
on average, two or three antibiotics derived from microorgan-
isms are launched each year (43). After a downturn in that
pace in recent decades, the pace is again quickening as scien-
tists realize that the effective life span of any antibiotic is
limited. Worldwide spending on ﬁnding new anti-infective
agents (including vaccines) is expected to increase 60% from
the spending levels in 1993 (7). New sources, especially plant
sources, are also being investigated. Second, the public is be-
coming increasingly aware of problems with the overprescrip-
tion and misuse of traditional antibiotics. In addition, many
people are interested in having more autonomy over their
medical care. A multitude of plant compounds (often of unre-
liable purity) is readily available over-the-counter from herbal
suppliers and natural-food stores, and self-medication with
these substances is commonplace. The use of plant extracts, as
well as other alternative forms of medical treatments, is enjoy-
ing great popularity in the late 1990s. Earlier in this decade,
approximately one-third of people surveyed in the United
States used at least one “unconventional” therapy during the
previous year (60). It was reported that in 1996, sales of bo-
tanical medicines increased 37% over 1995 (116). It is specu-
lated that the American public may be reacting to overpre-

scription of sometimes toxic drugs, just as their predecessors of
the 19th century (see below) reacted to the overuse of bleed-
ing, purging, and calomel (248).
Brief History
It is estimated that there are 250,000 to 500,000 species of
plants on Earth (25). A relatively small percentage (1 to 10%)
of these are used as foods by both humans and other animal
species. It is possible that even more are used for medicinal
purposes (146). Hippocrates (in the late ﬁfth century B.C.)
mentioned 300 to 400 medicinal plants (195). In the ﬁrst cen-
tury A.D., Dioscorides wrote De Materia Medica, a medicinal
plant catalog which became the prototype for modern phar-
macopoeias. The Bible offers descriptions of approximately 30
healing plants. Indeed, frankincense and myrrh probably en-
joyed their status of great worth due to their medicinal prop-
erties. Reported to have antiseptic properties, they were even
employed as mouthwashes. The fall of ancient civilizations
forestalled Western advances in the understanding of medici-
nal plants, with much of the documentation of plant pharma-
ceuticals being destroyed or lost (211). During the Dark Ages,
the Arab world continued to excavate their own older works
and to build upon them. Of course, Asian cultures were also
busy compiling their own pharmacopoeia. In the West, the
Renaissance years saw a revival of ancient medicine, which was
built largely on plant medicinals.
North America’s history of plant medicinal use follows two
strands—their use by indigenous cultures (Native Americans),
dating from prehistory (243), and an “alternative” movement
among Americans of European origin, beginning in the 19th
century. Native American use of plant medicinals has been
reviewed extensively in a series of articles by Moerman (146).
He reported that while 1,625 species of plants have been used
by various Native American groups as food, 2,564 have found
use as drugs (116). According to his calculations, this leaves
approximately 18,000 species of plants which were used for
neither food nor drugs. Speculations as to how and why a
selected number of plant species came into use for either food
or drugs is fascinating but outside the scope of this review.
Among Europeans living in the New World, the use of
botanicals was a reaction against invasive or toxic mainstream
medicinal practices of the day. No less a luminary than Oliver
Wendell Holmes noted that medical treatments in the 1800s
could be dangerous and ineffective. Examples include the use
of mercury baths in London “barber shops” to treat syphilis
and dangerous hallucinogens as a tuberculosis “cure.” In 1861
Holmes wrote, “If the whole materia medica as now used could
be sunk to the bottom of the sea, it would be all the better for
mankind—and all the worse for the ﬁshes” (92). In 1887, al-
ternative practitioners compiled their own catalogs, notably
the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States.
Mainstream medicine is increasingly receptive to the use of
antimicrobial and other drugs derived from plants, as tradi-
tional antibiotics (products of microorganisms or their synthe-
sized derivatives) become ineffective and as new, particularly
viral, diseases remain intractable to this type of drug. Another
driving factor for the renewed interest in plant antimicrobials
in the past 20 years has been the rapid rate of (plant) species
extinction (131). There is a feeling among natural-products
chemists and microbiologists alike that the multitude of poten-
tially useful phytochemical structures which could be synthe-
sized chemically is at risk of being lost irretrievably (25). There
is a scientiﬁc discipline known as ethnobotany (or ethnophar-
macology), whose goal is to utilize the impressive array of
knowledge assembled by indigenous peoples about the plant
and animal products they have used to maintain health (77,
182, 203, 234). Lastly, the ascendancy of the human immuno-
deﬁciency virus (HIV) has spurred intensive investigation into
the plant derivatives which may be effective, especially for use
in underdeveloped nations with little access to expensive West-
ern medicines. (For a comprehensive review of the search for
new anti-HIV agents, see reference 51.)
This review describes the current state of plant antimicrobi-
als in the United States, ranging from extracts commonly in
use, largely by the lay community, to substances being pros-
pected and tested by researchers and clinicians. Also, com-
pounds potentially effective in treating HIV infections, which
are being sought far and wide for probable use in North Amer-
ica, are also addressed. An attempt is also made to summarize
the current state of knowledge of relatively undeﬁned herbal
products, since clinicians in this country will encounter their
use among patients in the United States. This review does not
address the worldwide use of plants as medicinals, but, rather,
it focuses on plants and their extracts currently in use in North
America. Only phytochemicals reported to have anti-infective
properties are examined. The many plants used as immune
system boosters are outside the purview of this review. Within
these boundaries, reports cited in the peer-reviewed literature
are given heaviest emphasis. Detailed descriptions of individ-
ual plant-derived medications can be found in the ﬁrst edition
of the Physician’s Desk Reference for Herbal Medicines, pub-
lished by Medical Economics Company in 1998.
MAJOR GROUPS OF ANTIMICROBIAL
COMPOUNDS FROM PLANTS
Plants have an almost limitless ability to synthesize aromatic
substances, most of which are phenols or their oxygen-substi-
tuted derivatives (76). Most are secondary metabolites, of
which at least 12,000 have been isolated, a number estimated
to be less than 10% of the total (195). In many cases, these
substances serve as plant defense mechanisms against preda-
tion by microorganisms, insects, and herbivores. Some, such as
terpenoids, give plants their odors; others (quinones and tan-
nins) are responsible for plant pigment. Many compounds are
responsible for plant ﬂavor (e.g., the terpenoid capsaicin from
chili peppers), and some of the same herbs and spices used by
humans to season food yield useful medicinal compounds (Ta-
ble 1).
Useful antimicrobial phytochemicals can be divided into sev-
eral categories, described below and summarized in Table 2.
Phenolics and Polyphenols
Simple phenols and phenolic acids. Some of the simplest
bioactive phytochemicals consist of a single substituted phe-
nolic ring. Cinnamic and caffeic acids are common represen-
tatives of a wide group of phenylpropane-derived compounds
which are in the highest oxidation state (Fig. 1).
The common herbs tarragon and thyme both contain caffeic
acid, which is effective against viruses (245), bacteria (31, 224),
and fungi (58).
Catechol and pyrogallol both are hydroxylated phenols,
shown to be toxic to microorganisms. Catechol has two 2OH
groups, and pyrogallol has three. The site(s) and number of
hydroxyl groups on the phenol group are thought to be related
to their relative toxicity to microorganisms, with evidence that
increased hydroxylation results in increased toxicity (76). In
addition, some authors have found that more highly oxidized
phenols are more inhibitory (192, 231). The mechanisms
thought to be responsible for phenolic toxicity to microorgan-

isms include enzyme inhibition by the oxidized compounds,
possibly through reaction with sulfhydryl groups or through
more nonspeciﬁc interactions with the proteins (137).
Phenolic compounds possessing a C3 side chain at a lower
level of oxidation and containing no oxygen are classiﬁed as
essential oils and often cited as antimicrobial as well. Eugenol
is a well-characterized representative found in clove oil (Fig.
1). Eugenol is considered bacteriostatic against both fungi (58)
and bacteria (224).
Quinones. Quinones are aromatic rings with two ketone
substitutions (Fig. 1). They are ubiquitous in nature and are
characteristically highly reactive. These compounds, being col-
ored, are responsible for the browning reaction in cut or in-
jured fruits and vegetables and are an intermediate in the
melanin synthesis pathway in human skin (194). Their pres-
ence in henna gives that material its dyeing properties (69).
The switch between diphenol (or hydroquinone) and diketone
(or quinone) occurs easily through oxidation and reduction
reactions. The individual redox potential of the particular qui-
none-hydroquinone pair is very important in many biological
systems; witness the role of ubiquinone (coenzyme Q) in mam-
malian electron transport systems. Vitamin K is a complex
naphthoquinone. Its antihemorrhagic activity may be related
to its ease of oxidation in body tissues (85). Hydroxylated
amino acids may be made into quinones in the presence of
suitable enzymes, such as a polyphenoloxidase (233). The re-
action for the conversion of tyrosine to quinone is shown in
Fig. 2.
In addition to providing a source of stable free radicals,
quinones are known to complex irreversibly with nucleophilic
amino acids in proteins (210), often leading to inactivation of
the protein and loss of function. For that reason, the potential
range of quinone antimicrobial effects is great. Probable tar-
gets in the microbial cell are surface-exposed adhesins, cell
wall polypeptides, and membrane-bound enzymes. Quinones
may also render substrates unavailable to the microorganism.
As with all plant-derived antimicrobials, the possible toxic ef-
fects of quinones must be thoroughly examined.
Kazmi et al. (112) described an anthraquinone from Cassia
italica, a Pakistani tree, which was bacteriostatic for Bacillus
anthracis, Corynebacterium pseudodiphthericum, and Pseudo-
monas aeruginosa and bactericidal for Pseudomonas pseudoma-
lliae. Hypericin, an anthraquinone from St. John’s wort (Hype-
ricum perforatum), has received much attention in the popular
press lately as an antidepressant, and Duke reported in 1985
that it had general antimicrobial properties (58).
Flavones, ﬂavonoids, and ﬂavonols. Flavones are phenolic
structures containing one carbonyl group (as opposed to the
two carbonyls in quinones) (Fig. 1). The addition of a 3-hy-
droxyl group yields a ﬂavonol (69). Flavonoids are also hy-
droxylated phenolic substances but occur as a C6-C3 unit linked
to an aromatic ring. Since they are known to be synthesized by
plants in response to microbial infection (56), it should not be
surprising that they have been found in vitro to be effective
antimicrobial substances against a wide array of microorgan-
isms. Their activity is probably due to their ability to complex
with extracellular and soluble proteins and to complex with
bacterial cell walls, as described above for quinones. More
lipophilic ﬂavonoids may also disrupt microbial membranes
(229).
Catechins, the most reduced form of the C3 unit in ﬂavonoid
compounds, deserve special mention. These ﬂavonoids have
been extensively researched due to their occurrence in oolong
green teas. It was noticed some time ago that teas exerted
antimicrobial activity (227) and that they contain a mixture of
catechin compounds. These compounds inhibited in vitro
Vibrio cholerae O1 (25), Streptococcus mutans (23, 185, 186,
228), Shigella (235), and other bacteria and microorganisms

(186, 224). The catechins inactivated cholera toxin in Vibrio
(25) and inhibited isolated bacterial glucosyltransferases in S.
mutans (151), possibly due to complexing activities described
for quinones above. This latter activity was borne out in in vivo
tests of conventional rats. When the rats were fed a diet con-
taining 0.1% tea catechins, ﬁssure caries (caused by S. mutans)
was reduced by 40% (166).
Flavonoid compounds exhibit inhibitory effects against mul-
tiple viruses. Numerous studies have documented the effec-
tiveness of ﬂavonoids such as swertifrancheside (172), glycyr-
rhizin (from licorice) (242), and chrysin (48) against HIV.
More than one study has found that ﬂavone derivatives are
inhibitory to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (21, 111). Kaul
et al. (111) provide a summary of the activities and modes of
action of quercetin, naringin, hesperetin, and catechin in in
vitro cell culture monolayers. While naringin was not inhibitory
to herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), poliovirus type 1,
parainﬂuenza virus type 3, or RSV, the other three ﬂavonoids
were effective in various ways. Hesperetin reduced intracellu-
lar replication of all four viruses; catechin inhibited infectivity
but not intracellular replication of RSV and HSV-1; and quer-
cetin was universally effective in reducing infectivity. The au-
thors propose that small structural differences in the com-
pounds are critical to their activity and pointed out another
advantage of many plant derivatives: their low toxic potential.
The average Western daily diet contains approximately 1 g of
mixed ﬂavonoids (124); pharmacologically active concentra-
tions are not likely to be harmful to human hosts.
An isoﬂavone found in a West African legume, alpinumi-
soﬂavone, prevents schistosomal infection when applied topi-
cally (175). Phloretin, found in certain serovars of apples, may
have activity against a variety of microorganisms (101). Galan-
gin (3,5,7-trihydroxyﬂavone), derived from the perennial herb
Helichrysum aureonitens, seems to be a particularly useful com-
pound, since it has shown activity against a wide range of
gram-positive bacteria as well as fungi (2) and viruses, in par-
ticular HSV-1 and coxsackie B virus type 1 (145).
Delineation of the possible mechanism of action of ﬂavones
and ﬂavonoids is hampered by conﬂicting ﬁndings. Flavonoids
lacking hydroxyl groups on their b-rings are more active
against microorganisms than are those with the 2OH groups
(38); this ﬁnding supports the idea that their microbial target is
the membrane. Lipophilic compounds would be more disrup-
tive of this structure. However, several authors have also found
the opposite effect; i.e., the more hydroxylation, the greater the
antimicrobial activity (189). This latter ﬁnding reﬂects the sim-
ilar result for simple phenolics (see above). It is safe to say that
there is no clear predictability for the degree of hydroxylation
and toxicity to microorganisms.
Tannins. “Tannin” is a general descriptive name for a group
of polymeric phenolic substances capable of tanning leather or
precipitating gelatin from solution, a property known as astrin-
gency. Their molecular weights range from 500 to 3,000 (87),
and they are found in almost every plant part: bark, wood,
leaves, fruits, and roots (192). They are divided into two
groups, hydrolyzable and condensed tannins. Hydrolyzable
tannins are based on gallic acid, usually as multiple esters with
D-glucose, while the more numerous condensed tannins (often
called proanthocyanidins) are derived from ﬂavonoid mono-
mers (Fig. 1). Tannins may be formed by condensations of
ﬂavan derivatives which have been transported to woody tis-
sues of plants. Alternatively, tannins may be formed by poly-
merization of quinone units (76). This group of compounds has
received a great deal of attention in recent years, since it was
suggested that the consumption of tannin-containing bever-

ages, especially green teas and red wines, can cure or prevent
a variety of ills (198).
Many human physiological activities, such as stimulation of
phagocytic cells, host-mediated tumor activity, and a wide
range of anti-infective actions, have been assigned to tannins
(87). One of their molecular actions is to complex with proteins
through so-called nonspeciﬁc forces such as hydrogen bonding
and hydrophobic effects, as well as by covalent bond formation
(87, 210). Thus, their mode of antimicrobial action, as de-
scribed in the section on quinones (see above), may be related
to their ability to inactivate microbial adhesins, enzymes, cell
envelope transport proteins, etc. They also complex with poly-
saccharide (247). The antimicrobial signiﬁcance of this partic-
ular activity has not been explored. There is also evidence for

direct inactivation of microorganisms: low tannin concentra-
tions modify the morphology of germ tubes of Crinipellis per-
niciosa (33). Tannins in plants inhibit insect growth (196) and
disrupt digestive events in ruminal animals (35).
Scalbert (192) reviewed the antimicrobial properties of tan-
nins in 1991. He listed 33 studies which had documented the
inhibitory activities of tannins up to that point. According to
these studies, tannins can be toxic to ﬁlamentous fungi, yeasts,
and bacteria. Condensed tannins have been determined to
bind cell walls of ruminal bacteria, preventing growth and
protease activity (105). Although this is still speculative, tan-
nins are considered at least partially responsible for the anti-
biotic activity of methanolic extracts of the bark of Terminalia
alata found in Nepal (221). This activity was enhanced by UV
light activation (320 to 400 nm at 5 W/m2 for 2 h). At least two
studies have shown tannins to be inhibitory to viral reverse
transcriptases (111, 155).
Coumarins. Coumarins are phenolic substances made of
fused benzene and a-pyrone rings (161). They are responsible
for the characteristic odor of hay. As of 1996, at least 1,300 had
been identiﬁed (95). Their fame has come mainly from their
antithrombotic (223), anti-inﬂammatory (177), and vasodila-
tory (152) activities. Warfarin is a particularly well-known cou-
marin which is used both as an oral anticoagulant and, inter-
estingly, as a rodenticide (113). It may also have antiviral
effects (24). Coumarins are known to be highly toxic in rodents
(232) and therefore are treated with caution by the medical
community. However, recent studies have shown a “pro-
nounced species-dependent metabolism” (244), so that many
in vivo animal studies cannot be extrapolated to humans. It
appears that toxic coumarin derivatives may be safely excreted
in the urine in humans (244).
Several other coumarins have antimicrobial properties.
R. D. Thornes, working at the Boston Lying-In Hospital in
1954, sought an agent to treat vaginal candidiasis in his preg-
nant patients. Coumarin was found in vitro to inhibit Candida
albicans. (During subsequent in vivo tests on rabbits, the cou-
marin-spiked water supply was inadvertently given to all the
animals in the research facility and was discovered to be a
potent contraceptive agent when breeding programs started to
fail [225].) Its estrogenic effects were later described (206).
As a group, coumarins have been found to stimulate mac-
rophages (37), which could have an indirect negative effect on
infections. More speciﬁcally, coumarin has been used to pre-
vent recurrences of cold sores caused by HSV-1 in humans (24)
but was found ineffective against leprosy (225). Hydroxycin-
namic acids, related to coumarins, seem to be inhibitory to
gram-positive bacteria (66). Also, phytoalexins, which are hy-
droxylated derivatives of coumarins, are produced in carrots in
response to fungal infection and can be presumed to have
antifungal activity (95). General antimicrobial activity was doc-
umented in woodruff (Galium odoratum) extracts (224). All in
all, data about speciﬁc antibiotic properties of coumarins are
scarce, although many reports give reason to believe that some
utility may reside in these phytochemicals (26, 83, 193). Fur-
ther research is warranted.
Terpenoids and Essential Oils
The fragrance of plants is carried in the so called quinta
essentia, or essential oil fraction. These oils are secondary
metabolites that are highly enriched in compounds based on an
isoprene structure (Fig. 1). They are called terpenes, their
general chemical structure is C10H16, and they occur as diter-
penes, triterpenes, and tetraterpenes (C20, C30, and C40), as
well as hemiterpenes (C5) and sesquiterpenes (C15). When the
compounds contain additional elements, usually oxygen, they
are termed terpenoids.
Terpenoids are synthesized from acetate units, and as such
they share their origins with fatty acids. They differ from fatty
acids in that they contain extensive branching and are cyclized.
Examples of common terpenoids are methanol and camphor
(monoterpenes) and farnesol and artemisin (sesquiterpe-
noids). Artemisin and its derivative a-arteether, also known by
the name qinghaosu, ﬁnd current use as antimalarials (237). In
1985, the steering committee of the scientiﬁc working group of
the World Health Organization decided to develop the latter
drug as a treatment for cerebral malaria.
Terpenenes or terpenoids are active against bacteria (4, 8,
22, 82, 90, 121, 144, 197, 220, 221), fungi (18, 84, 122, 179, 180,
213, 221), viruses (74, 86, 173, 212, 246), and protozoa (78,
237). In 1977, it was reported that 60% of essential oil deriv-
atives examined to date were inhibitory to fungi while 30%
inhibited bacteria (39). The triterpenoid betulinic acid is just
one of several terpenoids (see below) which have been shown
to inhibit HIV. The mechanism of action of terpenes is not
fully understood but is speculated to involve membrane dis-
ruption by the lipophilic compounds. Accordingly, Mendoza et
al. (144) found that increasing the hydrophilicity of kaurene
diterpenoids by addition of a methyl group drastically reduced
their antimicrobial activity. Food scientists have found the ter-
penoids present in essential oils of plants to be useful in the
control of Listeria monocytogenes (16). Oil of basil, a commer-
cially available herbal, was found to be as effective as 125 ppm
chlorine in disinfecting lettuce leaves (241).
Chile peppers are a food item found nearly ubiquitously in
many Mesoamerican cultures (44). Their use may reﬂect more
than a desire to ﬂavor foods. Many essential nutrients, such as
vitamin C, provitamins A and E, and several B vitamins, are
found in chiles (27). A terpenoid constituent, capsaicin, has a
wide range of biological activities in humans, affecting the
nervous, cardiovascular, and digestive systems (236) as well as
ﬁnding use as an analgesic (47). The evidence for its antimi-
crobial activity is mixed. Recently, Cichewicz and Thorpe (42)
found that capsaicin might enhance the growth of Candida
albicans but that it clearly inhibited various bacteria to differing
extents. Although possibly detrimental to the human gastric
mucosa, capsaicin is also bactericidal to Helicobacter pylori
(106). Another hot-tasting diterpene, aframodial, from a Cam-
eroonian spice, is a broad-spectrum antifungal (18).
The ethanol-soluble fraction of purple prairie clover yields a
terpenoid called petalostemumol, which showed excellent ac-
tivity against Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus and
FIG. 2. Reaction for the conversion of tyrosine to quinone.

lesser activity against gram-negative bacteria as well as Can-
dida albicans (100). Two diterpenes isolated by Batista et al.
(23) were found to be more democratic; they worked well
against Staphylococcus aureus, V. cholerae, P. aeruginosa, and
Candida spp. When it was observed that residents of Mali used
the bark of a tree called Ptelopsis suberosa for the treatment of
gastric ulcers, investigators tested terpenoid-containing frac-
tions in 10 rats before and after the rats had ulcers chemically
induced. They found that the terpenoids prevented the forma-
tion of ulcers and diminished the severity of existent ulcers.
Whether this activity was due to antimicrobial action or to
protection of the gastric mucosa is not clear (53). Kadota et al.
(108) found that trichorabdal A, a diterpene from a Japanese
herb, could directly inhibit H. pylori.
Alkaloids
Heterocyclic nitrogen compounds are called alkaloids. The
ﬁrst medically useful example of an alkaloid was morphine,
isolated in 1805 from the opium poppy Papaver somniferum
(69); the name morphine comes from the Greek Morpheus,
god of dreams. Codeine and heroin are both derivatives of
morphine. Diterpenoid alkaloids, commonly isolated from the
plants of the Ranunculaceae, or buttercup (107) family (15),
are commonly found to have antimicrobial properties (163).
Solamargine, a glycoalkaloid from the berries of Solanum kha-
sianum, and other alkaloids may be useful against HIV infec-
tion (142, 200) as well as intestinal infections associated with
AIDS (140). While alkaloids have been found to have micro-
biocidal effects (including against Giardia and Entamoeba spe-
cies [78]), the major antidiarrheal effect is probably due to
their effects on transit time in the small intestine.
Berberine is an important representative of the alkaloid
group. It is potentially effective against trypanosomes (73) and
plasmodia (163). The mechanism of action of highly aromatic
planar quaternary alkaloids such as berberine and harmane
(93) is attributed to their ability to intercalate with DNA (176).
Lectins and Polypeptides
Peptides which are inhibitory to microorganisms were ﬁrst
reported in 1942 (19). They are often positively charged and
contain disulﬁde bonds (253). Their mechanism of action may
be the formation of ion channels in the microbial membrane
(222, 253) or competitive inhibition of adhesion of microbial
proteins to host polysaccharide receptors (202). Recent inter-
est has been focused mostly on studying anti-HIV peptides and
lectins, but the inhibition of bacteria and fungi by these mac-
romolecules, such as that from the herbaceous Amaranthus,
has long been known (50).
Thionins are peptides commonly found in barley and wheat
and consist of 47 amino acid residues (45, 143). They are toxic
to yeasts and gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria (65).
Thionins AX1 and AX2 from sugar beet are active against
fungi but not bacteria (118). Fabatin, a newly identiﬁed 47-
residue peptide from fava beans, appears to be structurally
related to g-thionins from grains and inhibits E. coli, P. aerugi-
nosa, and Enterococcus hirae but not Candida or Saccharomy-
ces (253).
The larger lectin molecules, which include mannose-speciﬁc
lectins from several plants (20), MAP30 from bitter melon
(128), GAP31 from Gelonium multiﬂorum (28), and jacalin
(64), are inhibitory to viral proliferation (HIV, cytomegalovi-
rus), probably by inhibiting viral interaction with critical host
cell components. It is worth emphasizing that molecules and
compounds such as these whose mode of action may be to
inhibit adhesion will not be detected by using most general
plant antimicrobial screening protocols, even with the bioas-
say-guided fractionation procedures (131, 181) used by natu-
ral-products chemists (see below). It is an area of ethnophar-
macology which deserves attention, so that initial screens of
potentially pharmacologically active plants (described in refer-
ences 25, 43, and 238) may be made more useful.
Mixtures
The chewing stick is widely used in African countries as an
oral hygiene aid (in place of a toothbrush) (156). Chewing
sticks come from different species of plants, and within one
stick the chemically active component may be heterogeneous
(5). Crude extracts of one species used for this purpose, Serin-
deia werneckei, inhibited the periodontal pathogens Porphy-
romonas gingivalis and Bacteroides melaninogenicus in vitro
(183). The active component of the Nigerian chewing stick
(Fagara zanthoxyloides) was found to consist of various alka-
loids (157). Whether these compounds, long utilized in devel-
oping countries, might ﬁnd use in the Western world is not yet
known.
Papaya (Carica papaya) yields a milky sap, often called a
latex, which is a complex mixture of chemicals. Chief among
them is papain, a well-known proteolytic enzyme (162). An
alkaloid, carpaine, is also present (34). Terpenoids are also
present and may contribute to its antimicrobial properties
(224). Osato et al. (168) found the latex to be bacteriostatic to
B. subtilis, Enterobacter cloacae, E. coli, Salmonella typhi, Staph-
ylococcus aureus, and Proteus vulgaris.
Ayurveda is a type of healing craft practiced in India but not
unknown in the United States. Ayurvedic practitioners rely on
plant extracts, both “pure” single-plant preparations and mixed
formulations. The preparations have lyrical names, such as
Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera root) (54), Cauvery 100 (a
mixture) (133), and Livo-vet (125). These preparations are
used to treat animals as well as humans (125). In addition to
their antimicrobial activities, they have been found to have
antidiarrheal (134), immunomodulatory (54, 133), anticancer
(59), and psychotropic (201) properties. In vivo studies of
Abana, an Ayurvedic formulation, found a slight reduction in
experimentally induced cardiac arrhythmias in dogs (75). Two
microorganisms against which Ayurvedic preparations have
activity are Aspergillus spp. (54) and Propionibacterium acnes
(170). (The aspergillosis study was performed with mice in
vivo, and it is therefore impossible to determine whether the
effects are due to the stimulation of macrophage activity in the
whole animal rather than to direct antimicrobial effects.)
The toxicity of Ayurvedic preparations has been the subject
of some speculation, especially since some of them include
metals. Prpic-Majic et al. identiﬁed high levels of lead in the
blood of adult volunteers who had self-medicated with
Ayurvedic medicines (178).
Propolis is a crude extract of the balsam of various trees; it
is often called bee glue, since honeybees gather it from the
trees. Its chemical composition is very complex: like the latexes
described above, terpenoids are present, as well as ﬂavonoids,
benzoic acids and esters, and substituted phenolic acids and
esters (9). Synthetic cinnamic acids, identical to those from
propolis, were found to inhibit hemagglutination activity of
inﬂuenza virus (199). Amoros et al. found that propolis was
active against an acyclovir-resistant mutant of HSV-1, adeno-
virus type 2, vesicular stomatitis virus, and poliovirus (9). Mix-
tures of chemicals, such as are found in latex and propolis, may
act synergistically. While the ﬂavone and ﬂavonol components
were active in isolation against HSV-1, multiple ﬂavonoids
incubated simultaneously with the virus were more effective

than single chemicals, a possible explanation of why propolis is
more effective than its individual compounds (10). Of course,
mixtures are more likely to contain toxic constituents, and they
must be thoroughly investigated and standardized before ap-
proved for use on a large-scale basis in the West.
Other Compounds
Many phytochemicals not mentioned above have been found
to exert antimicrobial properties. This review has attempted to
focus on reports of chemicals which are found in multiple
instances to be active. It should be mentioned, however, that
there are reports of antimicrobial properties associated with
polyamines (in particular spermidine) (70), isothiocyanates
(57, 104), thiosulﬁnates (215), and glucosides (149, 184).
Polyacetylenes deserve special mention. Estevez-Braun et al.
isolated a C17 polyacetylene compound from Bupleurum salici-
folium, a plant native to the Canary Islands. The compound,
8S-heptadeca-2(Z),9(Z)-diene-4,6-diyne-1,8-diol, was inhibi-
tory to S. aureus and B. subtilis but not to gram-negative bac-
teria or yeasts (62). Acetylene compounds and ﬂavonoids from
plants traditionally used in Brazil for treatment of malaria
fever and liver disorders have also been associated with anti-
malarial activity (29).
Much has been written about the antimicrobial effects of
cranberry juice. Historically, women have been told to drink
the juice in order to prevent and even cure urinary tract infec-
tions. In the early 1990s, researchers found that the monosac-
charide fructose present in cranberry and blueberry juices
competitively inhibited the adsorption of pathogenic E. coli to
urinary tract epithelial cells, acting as an analogue for mannose
(252). Clinical studies have borne out the protective effects of
cranberry juice (17). Many fruits contain fructose, however,
and researchers are now seeking a second active compound
from cranberry juice which contributes to the antimicrobial
properties of this juice (252).
EXPERIMENTAL APPROACHES
Extraction Methods
Advice abounds for the amateur herbalist on how to prepare
healing compounds from plants and herbs. Water is almost
universally the solvent used to extract activity. At home, dried
plants can be ingested as teas (plants steeped in hot water) or,
rarely, tinctures (plants in alcoholic solutions) or inhaled via
steam from boiling suspensions of the parts. Dried plant parts
can be added to oils or petroleum jelly and applied externally.
Poultices can also be made from concentrated teas or tinctures
(30, 224).
Scientiﬁc analysis of plant components follows a logical
pathway. Plants are collected either randomly or by following
leads supplied by local healers in geographical areas where the
plants are found (135). Initial screenings of plants for possible
antimicrobial activities typically begin by using crude aqueous
or alcohol extractions and can be followed by various organic
extraction methods. Since nearly all of the identiﬁed compo-
nents from plants active against microorganisms are aromatic
or saturated organic compounds, they are most often obtained
through initial ethanol or methanol extraction. In fact, many
studies avoid the use of aqueous fractionation altogether. The
exceptional water-soluble compounds, such as polysaccharides
(e.g., starch) and polypeptides, including fabatin (253) and
various lectins, are commonly more effective as inhibitors of
pathogen (usually virus) adsorption and would not be identi-
ﬁed in the screening techniques commonly used. Occasionally
tannins and terpenoids will be found in the aqueous phase, but
they are more often obtained by treatment with less polar
solvents. Table 3 lists examples of extraction solvents and the
resultant active fractions reported in recent studies. Com-
pounds which, according to the literature, partition exclusively
in particular solvents are indicated in boldface type in the
table.
Any part of the plant may contain active components. For
instance, the roots of ginseng plants contain the active sa-
ponins and essential oils, while eucalyptus leaves are harvested
for their essential oils and tannins. Some trees, such as the
balsam poplar, yield useful substances in their bark, leaves, and
shoots (224).
For alcoholic extractions, plant parts are dried, ground to a
ﬁne texture, and then soaked in methanol or ethanol for ex-
tended periods. The slurry is then ﬁltered and washed, after
which it may be dried under reduced pressure and redissolved
in the alcohol to a determined concentration. When water is
used for extractions, plants are generally soaked in distilled
water, blotted dry, made into a slurry through blending, and
then strained or ﬁltered. The ﬁltrate can be centrifuged (ap-
proximately 20,000 3 g, for 30 min) multiple times for clariﬁ-
cation (42, 221). Crude products can then be used in disc
diffusion and broth dilution assays to test for antifungal and
antibacterial properties and in a variety of assays to screen for
antiviral activity, as described below.
Natural-products chemists further purify active chemicals
from crude extracts by a variety of methods. Petalostemumol,
a ﬂavanol from purple prairie clover, was obtained from the
ethanol extract by partitioning between ethyl acetate and wa-
ter, followed by partitioning between n-hexane and 10% meth-
anol. The methanol fraction was chromatographed and eluted
with toluene (100). Terpenoid lactones have been obtained by

successive extractions of dried bark with hexane, CHCl3, and
methanol, with activity concentrating in the CHCl3 fraction
(180). The chemical structures of the puriﬁed material can
then be analyzed. Techniques for further chemical analysis
include chromatography, bioautography, radioimmunoassay,
various methods of structure identiﬁcation, and newer tools
such as fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, tandem
mass spectroscopy (181), high-performance liquid chromatog-
raphy, capillary zone electrophoresis, nuclear magnetic reso-
nance spectroscopy, and X-ray cystallography (25).
Recently, Eloff (61) examined a variety of extractants for
their ability to solubilize antimicrobials from plants, as well as
other factors such as their relative ranking as biohazards and
the ease of removal of solvent from the fraction. The focus of
the study was to provide a more standardized extraction
method for the wide variety of researchers working in diverse
settings. Although it is not one of the more frequently used
extractants in studies published to date, acetone received the
highest overall rating. In fact, in a review of 48 articles describ-
ing the screening of plant extracts for antimicrobial properties
in the most recent years of the Journal of Natural Products, the
Journal of Ethnopharmacology, and the International Journal of
Pharmacognosy, only one study used acetone as an extractant.
Of the solvents listed in Table 3, which are reported in the
recent literature with the highest frequency, Eloff ranked them
in the order methylene dichloride, methanol, ethanol, and wa-
ter. Table 4 displays the breakdown of scores for the various
solvents studied. The row indicating the number of inhibitors
extracted with each solvent points to two implications: ﬁrst,
that most active components are not water soluble, supporting
the data reported in Table 3, and second, that the most com-
monly used solvents (ethanol and methanol, both used as ini-
tial extractants in approximately 35% of the studies appearing
in the recent literature) may not demonstrate the greatest
sensitivity in yielding antimicrobial chemicals on an initial
screening. This disparity should be examined as the search for
new antimicrobials intensiﬁes.
Efﬁcacy
In vitro experiments. (i) Bacteria and fungi. Initial screening
of potential antibacterial and antifungal compounds from
plants may be performed with pure substances (2, 23, 117) or
crude extracts (73, 203, 182). The methods used for the two
types of organisms are similar. The two most commonly used
screens to determine antimicrobial susceptibility are the broth
dilution assay (18, 89, 219) and the disc or agar well diffusion
assay (153); clinical microbiologists are very familiar with these
assays. Adaptations such as the agar overlay method (138) may
also be used. In some cases, the inoculated plates or tubes are
exposed to UV light (221) to screen for the presence of light-
sensitizing photochemicals. Other variations of these methods
are also used. For instance, to test the effects of extracts on
invasive Shigella species, noncytotoxic concentrations of the
extracts can be added to Vero cell cultures exposed to a Shi-
gella inoculum (235). The decrease in cytopathic effect in the
presence of the plant extract is then measured.
In addition to these assays, antifungal phytochemicals can be
analyzed by a spore germination assay. Samples of plant ex-
tracts or pure compounds can be added to fungal spores col-
lected from solid cultures, placed on glass slides, and incubated
at an appropriate temperature (usually 25°C) for 24 h. Slides
are then ﬁxed in lactophenol-cotton blue and observed micro-
scopically for spore germination (179).
Of course, after initial screening of phytochemicals, more
detailed studies of their antibiotic effects should be conducted.
At this stage, more speciﬁc media can be used and MICs can
be effectively compared to those of a wider range of currently
used antibiotics. The investigation of plant extracts effective
against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (190, 229) provides an
example of prospecting for new compounds which may be
particularly effective against infections that are currently difﬁ-
cult to treat. Sato et al. (190) examined the activity of three
extracts from the fruiting bodies of the tree Terminalia chebula
RETS against methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant S.
aureus as well as 12 other gram-negative and gram-positive
bacteria. They found that gallic acid derivatives were more
effective against both types of S. aureus than they were against
other species.
(ii) Viruses. Several methods are available to detect either
virucidal or inhibitory (antiviral) plant activity. Investigators
can look for cytopathic effects or plaque formation (1, 111) or
for transformation or proliferative effects on cell lines (48).
Viral replication may be assayed by detection of viral products
such as DNA, RNA, or polypeptides (127, 171). Vlietinck and
Vanden Berghe (238) have noted that the method for assaying
antiviral substances used in various laboratories is not stan-
dardized, and therefore the results are often not comparable to
one another. These authors also point out that researchers
must distinguish between merely toxic effects of agents on host

cells and true antiviral properties of the plant extracts. Table 5
lists various in vitro antiviral screening assays.
It should be mentioned here that antiviral assays often
screen for active substances which prevent adsorption of the
microorganism to host cells; this activity is overlooked in
screening procedures for antibacterial and antifungal sub-
stances. However, the large body of literature accumulating on
antiadhesive approaches to bacterial infections (109) suggests
that phytochemicals should be assessed for this class of action
in addition to their killing and inhibitory activities.
(iii) Protozoa and helminths. Screening plant extracts for
activity against protozoa and helminths can be more compli-
cated than screening for activity against bacteria, fungi, or
viruses. Growing the organisms is often more difﬁcult, and
fewer organisms are obtained. Assays are generally speciﬁc for
the microorganism. For instance, Freiburghaus et al. (73) used
two methods to assay compounds for effectiveness against
Trypanosoma brucei. First, 66-h tissue cultures of the trypano-
somes were exposed to various concentrations of extracts, and
then the MICs were determined with an inverted microscope.
(In this case, the MIC was deﬁned as the lowest concentration
of extract which completely inhibited the growth of the try-
panosomes.) Second, these authors used a ﬂuorescence assay
of trypanosome viability in microtiter wells.
There is great interest in plant chemicals which may have
anti-infective properties for Plasmodium species. One method
for testing extracts which may be toxic to plasmodia uses ra-
diolabelled microorganisms in an erythrocyte infection assay
with microtiter dishes (72). Parasitized erythrocytes are incu-
bated with and without test substances, and the numbers of
Plasmodium organisms after the incubation period are quan-
titated. Another laboratory directly measures decreases in the
growth of Plasmodium under the inﬂuence of the extracts (29).
In vivo testing of phytochemicals. Two prime examples of
animal studies from the recent literature are the descriptions
of the effects of oolong tea polyphenols on dental caries in rats
(186) and cholera in mice (226) (discussed above). Another
bacterial infection model, P. aeruginosa lung infection of athy-
mic rats, was used to test subcutaneous administrations of
ginseng. Treated rats had decreased lung pathology and bac-
terial load, although enhanced humoral immunity was thought
to be at least partially responsible (207).
Perhaps because of the long-standing interest in alternative
pharmaceuticals for use in developing and tropical regions of
the world, many of the in vivo studies to date have examined
the antiprotozoal effectiveness of plant extracts (55). Two re-
cent studies with rats used experimental Entamoeba infections
to test the effectiveness of a crude Indian herbal extract (205)
and of an ethanolic extract of Piper longum fruits, probably
containing the alkaloid piperine (78). After applying the chlo-
roform extract of the legume Milletia thonningii topically to the
skin of mice, Perrett et al. (175) found that it prevented the
establishment of subsequent Schistosoma mansoni infection.
There are also animal studies of the activity of various extracts
of the bark of Pteleopsis suberosa against ulcers (53), of papaya
latex against infections with the helminth Heligmosomoides
polygyrus (191), and of Santolina chamaecyparissus essential oil
against candidal infections (213).
An Ayurvedic formulation, Cauvery 100, was administered
orally to rats either before or after diarrhea was induced by
castor oil. While this trial did not test antimicrobial activities of
the preparation but, rather, its effect on gut motility and ion
loss in the sick animals, it showed that Cauvery 100 had both a
protective and a curative effect in rats (134). A similar study
with similar results was performed on rats with chemically
induced ulcers (133). The Ayurvedic Ashwagandha was found
to prolong the survival period of BALB/c mice infected with
Aspergillus, an effect believed to be mediated by increased
macrophage function (54).
Clinical trials in humans. Of course, plants have been used
for centuries to treat infections and other illnesses in humans
in aboriginal groups, but controlled clinical studies are scarce.
In some cases, traditional healers working together with
trained scientists have begun keeping records of the safety and
effectiveness of phytochemical treatments, but these are gen-
erally uncontrolled and unrandomized studies. Examples of

peer-reviewed trials of the use of phytochemicals in humans
are brieﬂy reported here.
A cross-sectional epidemiological study (thus, not a random-
ized trial) of the effectiveness of chewing sticks versus tooth-
brushes in promoting oral hygiene was conducted in West
Africa. The study’s authors found a reduced effectiveness in
chewing-stick users compared to toothbrush users and con-
cluded that the antimicrobial chemicals known to be present in
the sticks added no oral health beneﬁt (156). Also, regarding
oral health, mouthrinses containing various antimicrobials
have been evaluated in humans (reviewed in reference 240).
Mouthrinses containing phytochemicals were not found to be
as effective in decreasing plaque or clinical gingivitis as were
Listerine or chlorhexidine.
To date, few randomized clinical trials of plant antimicrobi-
als have been performed. Giron et al. (79) compared an extract
of Solanum nigrescens with nystatin, both given as intravaginal
suppositories, in women with conﬁrmed C. albicans vaginitis.
The extract proved to be as efﬁcacious as nystatin. In 1996 the
long-recognized effects of cranberry juice on urinary tract in-
fections were studied in a group of elderly women. No data are
provided by the author about clinical outcomes, but treated
women had fewer bacteria in their urine than did the untreated
group (17).
Four different Ayurvedic formulations were tested against a
placebo for their effectiveness against acne vulgaris. One of the
formulations, Sunder Vati, produced a signiﬁcantly greater
reduction in lesion count than did the other three and the
placebo. No toxic side effects were observed (170). Two pro-
prietary compounds derived from tropical plants, Provir, for
the treatment of respiratory viral infections, and Virend, a
topical antiherpes agent, were tested in clinical trials in 1994
(114). Since then, the efﬁcacy and safety of Virend have been
established in phase II studies (167).
PLANTS WITH EFFICACY AGAINST HUMAN
IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS
Effective therapies for HIV infection are being sought far
and wide, in the natural world as well as in laboratories. As one
example of in vivo anti-HIV studies, infection in mice has been
studied. Glycyrrhizin, found in Glycyrrhiza plants (the source of
licorice), extended the life of the retrovirus-infected mice from
14 to 17 weeks (242). A crude extract of the cactus Opuntia
streptacantha had marked antiviral effects in vitro, and toxicity
studies performed in mice, horses, and humans found the ex-
tract to be safe (3).
The scope of studies of anti-HIV plant extracts is too broad
to handle in detail in the present review, but Table 6 summa-
rizes many of the compounds studied to date as well as their
purported targets of action. The interested reader is referred
to several useful reviews (36, 155, 172, 217).
COMMERCIAL AVAILABILITY AND
SAFETY OF COMPOUNDS
A wide variety of plant extracts, mixtures, and single plant
compounds are available in the United States without a pre-
scription through health food stores and vitamin retailers. For
example, preparations of ﬂavones (brand names Flavons 500
and Citrus Bioﬂavonoids) are sold by supplement suppliers.
Capsaicin appears in a topical antiarthritis cream available in
mainstream grocery and drug stores. The over-the-counter
preparations are relatively unregulated. This results in prepa-
rations of uncertain and variable purity.
Many stores also sell whole dried plants, which have been
found occasionally to be misidentiﬁed, with potentially disas-
trous consequences. Obviously, many plants can also be grown
by the consumer in home gardens. In 1994, Congress passed
the Dietary Supplement Health Education Act, which required
the Food and Drug Administration to develop labeling re-
quirements speciﬁcally designed for products containing ingre-
dients such as vitamins, minerals, and herbs intended to sup-
plement the diet. The new rules, issued in late 1997, require
products to be labeled as a dietary supplement and carry a
“Supplement Facts” panel with information similar to the “Nu-
trition Facts” panels appearing on processed foods. The rules
also require that products containing botanical ingredients
specify the part of the plant used (71).
The Food and Drug Administration regulates dietary sup-
plements as foods, as long as no drug claims are made for them
(63). Other organizations overseeing herbals and botanicals
are the American Dietetic Association’s Commission on Di-
etary Supplement Labels (11) and the Food and Nutrition
Science Alliance (12).
The ﬁrst investigational new drug application for herbal
pharmaceuticals, available by prescription, was submitted in
1997 (13). Whether this is the beginning of a substantial “rush
to market” is unclear. Some analysts suggest that pharmaceu-
tical companies will not invest in drug testing for botanicals
since it is still unclear whether proprietary claims can be made
(49). Richard van den Broek, industry analyst, concurs, saying
that most novel antibiotic research is being conducted instead
by biotechnology companies (7).
Plants and/or plant components which are currently avail-
able to consumers as supplements through commercial outlets
are among those listed in Table 1. Rough toxicity rankings are
also provided. It has long been recognized that possibly ther-
apeutic foodstuffs may also contain substances which act as
poisons in humans (132). Clinical scientists and practitioners
are best advised to be aware of the widespread self-medication
with these products and to consider their effects on patients.
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Scientists from divergent ﬁelds are investigating plants anew
with an eye to their antimicrobial usefulness. A sense of ur-
gency accompanies the search as the pace of species extinction
continues. Laboratories of the world have found literally thou-
sands of phytochemicals which have inhibitory effects on all
types of microorganisms in vitro. More of these compounds
should be subjected to animal and human studies to determine
their effectiveness in whole-organism systems, including in par-
ticular toxicity studies as well as an examination of their effects
on beneﬁcial normal microbiota. It would be advantageous to
standardize methods of extraction and in vitro testing so that
the search could be more systematic and interpretation of
results would be facilitated. Also, alternative mechanisms of
infection prevention and treatment should be included in ini-
tial activity screenings. Disruption of adhesion is one example
of an anti-infection activity not commonly screened for cur-
rently. Attention to these issues could usher in a badly needed
new era of chemotherapeutic treatment of infection by using
plant-derived principles.
