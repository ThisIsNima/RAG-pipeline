INTRODUCTION  
'Meteorites-contain far more information about the early  
solar system than was once believed. Chondrites, as the most.  
primitive meteorites, have of course long. served as the basis  
of the "cosmic! (better "solar-system") abundance curve,-.on  
the assumption that they represent-well-mixed rubble from the  
But during the last decade another 
inner-solar system.  
view has gained ascendancy: 
that chondrites are an original  
and relatively unaltered condensate from the solar nebula. 
If.  
this is true, then chondrites contain a unique archeological  
record of-physical and chemical conditions in the solar nebula.  
It is the job of the meteoriticist to decipher this record; to  
translate structure, composition, and mineralogy into tempera­
ture, pressure, time, and chemical environment.  
By a fortunate coincidence, observational and theoretical work  
on proto-stars has advanced to the point where detailed estimates  
of some of these same parameters can be made. To be sure, the  
meteoritic evidence is sometimes ambiguous and at best applies  
to only one solar system. Nonetheless it appears that compari­
sons between meteoritic'and astronomical observations are  
becoming increasingly fruitful..  
The origin of meteorites has been vigorously debated during  
the last decade. The prevailing view at present is that most  
(or all) meteorites come from the asteroid belt. 
But a cometary  
origin of some types (e.g. carbonaceous chondrites) remains

an intriguing possibility. Thus meteorites contain clues to  
conditions at 2 to 4 a.u., perhaps also to those in the giant  
planet zone.  
In this paper, I shall review the meteoritic evidence as  
of late 1970, emphasizing those properties that relate to the  
solar nebula. The paper begins with a glossary followed by  
brief sections-on the classification of chondrites and the com­
position of primordial matter. The next section, comprising  
the major part of the paper, reviews the processes that may  
have influenced the chemistry and mineralogy of chondrites.  
The following section discusses the time scale of meteorite  
evolution. The last section sums up the principal conclusions  
and reviews the implications for planetary cosmogony.  
Any decipherment of an archeological record involves some  
subjectivity. 
I shall try to follow the rules set down in my  
pre ious reviews (Anders, 1964, 1968): 
(a) any interpretation  
must be consistent with all available evidence; and (b), of'  
several alternative interpretations, the simplest one is to be  
preferred. 
It is not obvious that the latter rule (Occam's  
principle) is applicable to meteorites. Authorities as eminent  
as Urey (1967) and Suess (1965) believe that meteorites had a  
very complicated history; if this view is accepted then Occam's  
principle is not a valid guide. The reader is therefore  
referred to the above reviews for a different view of the same  
subject.

Glossary  
Chondrites. -
Chondrites are stony meteorites containing  
chondrules, millimeter-sized silicate spherules that appear to  
be frozen droplets of a melt. They consist largely of olivine  
[(Mg,Fe) 2 SiO 4 ], pyroxene [(Mg,Fe)Si03 ], and plagioclase feldspar  
[solid solution of CaA1 2Si 20 8 and NaAlSi 30 8 ]. 
In the more  
primitive chondrites, glass is often found in place of crystal­
line feldspar. 
(Special names exist for the end-members of  
the Fe-Mg solid solutions:' MgSiO 3 = enstatite; FeSiO3 = 
ferrosilite; Mg2 SiO 4 = forsterite; Fe2 SiO 4 = fayalite. We shall  
use them only in cases of absolute necessity).  
Chondrules are embedded in a ground-mass or matrix. 
In  
the less primitive chondrites, the matrix is somewhat more fine­
grained than the chondrules, but otherwise has the same mineralogy  
and composition. Millimeter-sized particles of metal (nickel­
iron with 5-60% Ni) and troilite (FeS) are also present. 
In  
the more primitive chondrites, the matrix is very fine-grained  
- 
(to '10
6 cm) and richer in Fe + than the chondrules.  
Classification of Chondrites  
Of the four principal meteorite classes (chondrites,  
achondrites, irons, and stony irons), chondrites are undoubtedly  
the most primitive, containing all non-volatile elements in  
approximately solar proportions. Nonetheless, there are well­
defined differences among the five subclasses of chondrites.  
At last count, some 50-odd elements showed such abundance

----- Page 6 (native) -----
-4­
differences (Larimer and Anders, 1970), mostly subtle (10 to 50%),  
but occasionally large (factors of 2 to 1000). 
A few of these  
differences may have been established in the meteorite parent  
bodies, but the majority seem to date back to the solar nebula.  
Let us review the classification of chondrites, and then explore  
the chemical differences one by one.  
The most up-to-date classification of chondrites is that  
of Van Schmus and Wood (1967). 
It retains the traditional sub­
division into 5 major groups on the basis of chemical criteria:  
ratio of metallic to total iron; Fe/Si and Mg/Si ratios; degree  
of oxidation of iron as measured by Fe2+/(Fe2++Mg 2 + ) ratio in  
silicates, etc. (Table 1). 
In addition, it subdivides each  
chemical group into a maximum of 6 "petrologic types" reflecting  
the extreme range of chondrule-matrix intergrowth. Chondrites  
with sharply delineated chondrules and submicron-sized, opaque  
matrix are classified as 
types 2 or 3; those with less distinct  
chondrules and coarser-grained matrix, as progressively higher  
types, 4 to 6. The classification is based on 10 petrographic  
criteria. 
A separate category, Type 1, is reserved for the  
chondrule-free Type I carbonaceous chondrites.  
An important distinction is only subtly hinted at in Table 1.  
Whereas all 3 classes of ordinary chondrites are "isochemical",  
i.e. have essentially constant major element contents from Types  
3 to 6, C and E chondrites are not. 
The larger standard devia­
tions in major element ratios reflect systematic compositional

----- Page 7 (native) -----
- 5 ­
variations from the lower to the higher petrologic types.  
Which of the properties in Table 1 were established in the  
solar nebula and which in the meteorite parent bodies? Though  
we have no foolproof criterion for deciding where a given feature  
arose, circumstantial evidence suggests that most of the  
chemical properties date back to the nebula (Larimer and Anders,  
1967, 1970; Keays et al., 1971). 
On the other hand, some of  
the textural properties such as the increasing recrystallization  
from Types 2 to 6 seem to have developed in the meteorite parent  
bodies by sust'ained heating (thermal metamorphism;, Wood, 1962a;  
Dodd, 1969). 
Yet there exist certain correlations between  
chemidal composition and petrologic type, and at least someof  
these apparently pre-date metamorphism. For this reason, the  
petrologic classification, though ostensibly based on a post­
nebular feature, will be useful in our discussion.  
Composition of Primordial Matter  
It is almost an axiom that the solar nebula was well-mixed  
in an isotopic and elemental sense (Suess, 1965). 
Certainly no  
isotopic differences have yet been found that might be attributed  
to incomplete mixing of material with different nucleosynthetic  
histories (Anders, 1964; Arnold and Suess, 1969). 
Elemental  
differences have of course been observed (Table 1). 
All are  
explicable by chemical 
fractionations, however, and though the  
locale of such fractionation cannot be strictly specified,  
-4±2  
the pressures inferred in some cases (10 
atm; Larimer and

----- Page 8 (native) -----
- 6 - 
Anders, 1970) are more appropriate to the solar nebula than to  
an interstellar cloud. 
Moreover, it is unlikely that initial  
compositional differences could have persisted throughout the  
enormous (10 3-fold) contraction from interstellar to nebular  
densities, even if interstellar grains had not been vaporized  
in the process. Thus we are probably justified in assuming  
that the solar nebula once had completely uniform elemental  
composition.  
Granted this assumption, we can attempt to deduce this  
composition. Goles (1969) has likened the search for this  
"primordial" composition to the search for the Holy Grail. The  
analogy is apt insofar as fervor is concerned, though medieval  
bloodshed has been replaced by mere acrimony.  
Most authors regard C1 chondrites as the closest available  
approximation of primordial solar-system matter. This point of  
view was opposed by Urey (1964, 1967) and Suess and Arnold (1969),  
on the grounds that the abundance of iron in CI chondrites was  
some 5-10 times-higher than that in the solar photosphere.  
Anders (1964) reviewed the problem at some length and suggested  
that thephotospheric value was in error because it led to various  
1  
implausible consequences. 
The issue was resolved by Garz and  
1 Urey (1966, 1,967) has accused me of "ignoring" or "neglecting"  
this problem although I devoted 11 pages of my 1964 review to  
it (pp. 644-650, 700-703).

----- Page 9 (native) -----

Kock (1969) who discovered a 10-fold error in the oscillator  
strengths of the FeI 
lines used for the solar abundance deter­
minations. Excellent agreement now exists between the meteoritic  
value ahd all solar values, whether based on allowed or forbidden  
lines of FeI or FeII in the photosphere, or on coronal lines  
(Garz et al., 1969, 1970; Baschek et al., 1970).  
Even with the iron problem resolved, there remains the  
legitimate question just how closely Cl chondrites resemble  
primordial solar-system matter. Anders (1971) has considered  
the problem in detail, on the basis of nuclear abundance sys­
tematics, cosmic-ray and solar abundances, and cosmochemical  
fra~tionation processes. He concludes that the maximum differ­
ence between Cl and primordial abundances is a factor of 1.5  
for groups of 10 or more elements and factors of 2 to 5 for  
individual elements. Obvious exceptions are highly volatile  
elements: H, C, 0, N, and noble gases. 
It seems that Cl  
chondrites (or abundance tables based-thereon, e.g. Cameron,  
1968) closely approximate the composition of primordial solar­
system matter.  
CHEMICAL PROCESSES IN THE EARLY SOLAR SYSTEM  
Separation of solids from gases is perhaps the most  
efficient cosmoemical fractionation process known (Suess,  
1965). -And there is good evidence for such separations during  
the formation of the meteorites and terrestrial planets. 
In  
terms of Brown's (1950) classification, these bodies consist  
largely of "earthy" material. The Earth, for example, contains

----- Page 10 (native) -----
2 
- 8 ­
only 10- 4 its cosmic complement of "ices" (e.g. H20) and  
I0-7 to 10-12 of,"gases" (e.g. noble gases). 
The depletion  
seems to have been governed by volatility and chemical reactivity  
rather than by molecular weight, because Ne (M.W. 20) is some 8  
orders of magnitude more depleted than H 2 0 (M.W. 18)(Urey, 1954).  
During the last few years it has become apparent that many  
other, more subtle fractionations are also due to volatility.  
Let us therefore examine the condensation sequence of a cosmic  
gas, and use it as a frame of reference for interpreting the  
2  
observed fractionations in meteorites. 
Condensation Sequence of a Cosmic Gas  
Condensation sequences have been calculated by Urey (1952a,  
1954), Lord (1965), Larimer (1967), Gilman (1969), and Clark  
et al. (1971). 
For an element E condensing in pure form, the  
basic condition for incipient condensation is that the partial  
pressure PE equal the vapor pressure pV" 
At that point, the gas  
Arrhenius and Alfven (1970) have proposed a radically different  
alternative: 
that condensation took place not from the solar  
nebula, but from a partially ionized and excited low-density gas  
that was gradually added to the circumsolar region. This model  
offers novel and promising explanations for the abundance patterns  
of mercury and noble gases. However, its-few remaining predictions  
happen to agree with those of the equilibrium condensation model.  
Detailed evaluation of the Arrhenius-Alfven model will have to  
await its further development.

is saturated in E. 
Since the gas consists largely of H2' PE  
can be approximated by (2E/H)pt, where E and H are the abundances  
of E and hydrogen in the gas, and Pt is the total pressure. The  
vapor pressure, in turn, is given by Pv = A/T + B, where A and B  
are constants varying from element to element. 
For elements  
condensing as compounds, the situation is similar, though the  
equations are more complex.  
Two condensation diagrams based on the work of Larimer  
(1967 and unpublished) are shown in Figure 1. They were calculated  
for a total pressure of 10- 4 atm (a value appropriate to the  
asteroid belt) and Cameron's (1968) cosmic abundances. The  
upper diagram refers to the situation just discussed: 
condensa­
tion of pure elements and compounds. 
It applies to conditions  
of rapid cooling, where substances condense in successive layers  
without inter-diffusion or alloy formation. The lower diagram,  
on the other hand, assumes complete diffusional equilibration,  
with formation of alloys and solid solutions to the limit of  
solubility. The effect of such alloy formation is to raise the  
coyidensation temperatures of minor elements, and to widen their  
condensation intervals. Of course, all intermediate situations  
are possible.  
A cooling gas of cosmic composition should thus condense  
in the following order. Below 20000 K, some highly refractory  
compounds of Ca, Al, Mg, and Ti appear, followed by magnesium  
silicates and nickel-iron at -1350 to -1200 0K and alkali silicates

----- Page 12 (native) -----
-
10 ­
at 1100 to 10000K. Up to this point, some 90% of chondritic  
matter has condensed. Only .H, C, N, 0, S and some volatile trace  
elements still remain in the gas phase. At 680 0K sulfur begins to  
condense'by the reaction Fe + H2S itFeS + H2 2 followed by Pb, Bi, TI,  
and In. Any remaining Fe reacts with H20 at 400 0K to give Fe304.  
Finally, water is bound as hydrated silicates at some temperature  
between 250 and-4000K.  
Both diagrams assume that nucleation is instantaneous, so that  
-the vapor never becomes supersaturated. This need not necessarily  
be so. 
Blander and his associates have pointed out that iron  
vapor, in particular, may supersaturate greatly, in which case  
the condensation would take a rather different course (Blander  
and Katz, 1967; Blander and Abdel-Gawad, 1969; Blander, 1970).  
We shall return to this alternative at appropriate times.  
Next we shall discuss individual fractionation processes,  
arranged in order of falling temperature.  
Fractionation of Refractory Elements.  
Significantly, the elements which head the condensation  
sequence all happen to be fractionated among the major chondrite  
classes. The variation in Mg/Si ratio has been known for a  
decade (Urey, 1961; Du Fresne and Anders, 1962) and has in fact  
been used as a classification criterion (Table 1). 
More recently,  
similar variations have,been found for Al, Ca, Ti (Ahrens et al.,  
1969), 
Cr, Hf, La and lanthanides, Sc, Th, U, Y, and Zr  
When the data are normalized to Si, 
'(Larimer and Anders, 1970).

----- Page 13 (native) -----

11 ­
the abundances consistently increase from enstatite to ordinary  
to carbonaceous chondrites in the average ratio 0.56 : 0.73  
1.00. All these elements are known to be highly refractory, and  
would be expected to concentrate in an early condensate or a  
volatilization residue.  
*Larimer and Anders (1970) have suggested that the trend  
from C to E chondrites reflects progressively greater loss of  
an early condensate (MgA12O 4
CaTiO 3, 
The degree 
0, 
Mg2 SiO 4 , etc.).  
of loss cannot be uniquely determined from the data, because  
Si, the element used for normalization, is itself fractionated,  
and so are all other elements that might serve in its place.  
Assuming that C1 chondrites represent primordial composition,  
they deduce minimum losses of 14% and 27% of the total condensable  
matter from ordinary and enstati-te chondrites.  
There is some evidence that material of the composition of  
this early condensate was present in the early solar system.  
Most C3 chondrites contain a few chondrules or irregular inclu­
sions (up to several cm in diameter) of about the composition of  
the early condensate: 
rich in Ca, Al, Ti, Mg; poor in Si  
(Christophe, 1968., 1969; Keil et al., 1969; Marvin et al., 1970).  
And -there exists astronomical evidence pointing to a fractionation  
of this sort. 
Herbig (1970a) noted that the interstellar gas is  
deficient in these same elements, and suggested that this might  
be due to partial condensation of refractories. 
Such condensation  
cannot have taken place at the low densities of interstellar

----- Page 14 (native) -----

12 ­
space. 
Herbig therefore suggests that a major part of interstella  
matter has once passed through solar nebulae. It would seem that  
partial condensation of refractories is a fairly universal feature,  
not limited to our own solar system.  
There is some evidence that the least volatile metals  
(Ir, ,Os, Re) were likewise fractionated with the early condensate  
(Larimer and Anders, 1970). 
Their abundances in iron meteorites  
vary by 3 orders of magnitude and are anti-correlated with those  
of equally reducible but more volatile elements, e.g. Pd and Ni  
(Yavnel", 1970). 
Similar though much smaller variations have  
been observed in chondrites (Baedecker et al., 1971).  
The-mechanism of the fractionation is still uncertain.  
Material rich in refractories can be produced either by partial  
condensation or by partial volatilization. The former would be  
expected if all interstellar grains were completely vaporized  
during collapse of the solar nebula (Cameron, 1962); and the.  
latter, if they were not. 
Once produced by whatever process,  
such material might settle toward the median plane of the nebula,  
thus becoming 'separated from the gas.  
The fate of the "lost" refractories invites speculation.  
Some authors have proposed that the Earth and Moon are enriched  
in refractory elements (U, Th, Ca, Sr, and Al) relative to  
chondrites (Gast, 1968; Ringwood and Essene, 1970). 
This might  
mean that the refractory material, being the oldest solid phase  
in the solar system, was preferentially accreted into asteroids

----- Page 15 (native) -----
-
13 ­
and planets. However, the reality of this enrichment is in some  
doubt. 
Thermal history calculations by Hanks and Anderson (1969)  
suggest that the Earth is not enriched in U and Th relative  
to C-chondrites. The same conclusion has been reached by  
Larimer.(1971) from consideration of crustal abundances of 12  
elements.  
Metal-Silicate Fractionation.  
Chondrites. - This fractionation manifests itself by varia­
tions in Fe/Si ratio among major chondrite classes (Table 1).  
That this is not merely a fractionation of iron but of metal  
phase is shown by the parallel variation in other siderophile  
(= iron-loving) elements, such as Ni, Co, Au, etc (Larimer and  
Anders, 1970). 
There has been much argument whether this frac­
tionation represents loss of silicate from iron-poor material  
(e.g. L-chondrites; Urey and Craig, 1953) or loss of metal  
from iron-rich material -(e.g. C1 or H-chondrites; Anders, 1964).  
Now that the discrepancy between the solar and the C1 chondrite  
abundance.of iron has been eliminated, there is little reason  
not to take the latter view.  
Larimer and Anders (1970) have attempted to infer from  
chemical data various details 6f the metal-silicate fractionation:  
specifically, direction, extent, temperature, and redox conditions.  
The "raw" Fe/Si and Ni/Si ratios suggest that many E chondrites  
have been enriched in metal relative to C chondrites (Table 1).  
However, these ratios are misleading, because appreciable amounts

----- Page 16 (native) -----
-
14 ­
of Si were lost during refractory-element fractionation. When  
a correction for this effect is applied, all chondrites turn out  
to have lower Fe/Si ratios than do Cl chondrites. Thus the frac­
tionation seems to have been uni-directional, involving only  
loss, but no gain, of metal. The maximum loss seems to have been  
~50%.  
The temperature during fractionation was estimated from  
abundances of volatile and siderophile trace elements, using the  
condensation diagram in Figure 1. It turns out that Ir, Pd, Ni,  
Co, Au, and Ge are systematically less abundant in L chondrites  
than in H chondrites, by a mean factor of 0.64, while Ga and S­
are about equally abundant in both classes. This implies that  
the first group of elements had already condensed on the metal  
when it was fractionated, while the latter group had not. 
The  
temperature during fractionation must thus lie below 1050'K,  
the temperature for condensation of 90% of the Ge at 10- 4 atm.  
A 100-fold change in pressure shifts this temperature by ±50'K.  
For E chondrites, a corresponding value of 
985±500K was derived.  
Planets. - Metal-silicate fractionations also seem to have  
occurred during formation ofthe terrestrial planets, as inferred  
by Noddack and Noddack (1930) and Urey (1952b) from the variations  
in,density. Urey (1967) has estimated the following Fe/Si ratios  
for the planets:  
Mercury 
Venus 
Earth 
Mars 
Moon  
Fe/Si 
-3.0 
-1.0 
-1.0 
0.6 
0.3

----- Page 17 (native) -----
-
15 -
These ratios must be regarded as approximate, because they are  
based on equations of state and planetary radii that are not  
always well-known. Bullen (1969) finds, for example, that  
identical compositions for Mars and the Earth are still within  
the realm of possibility. Nonetheless, there is no doubt that  
Mercury and the Moon differ substantially from the other 3 planets.  
Some uncertainty also arises from the assumption made in  
these calculations that planets and ordinary chondrites have  
2+ 
silicate phases of identical composition, including Fe 
content.  
This neglects possible differences in oxidation state and refractory­
element content. 
Indeed, Ringwood (1959, 1966) has tried to  
account for the density variations solely by differences in the  
degree of oxidation, while Levin (1957, 1963) postulated formation  
of metallized silicates at high pressures. 
However, neither  
hypothesis accounts for the high density of Mercury or for the  
variation in Fe/Si among various chondrite classes (Table 1).  
Since these data clearly indicate that a metal-silicate frac­
tionation took place in some parts of the solar system (0.4 a.u.  
and 2-4 a.u.), there seems to be little reason to assume that  
this process was inoperative between 0.7 and 1.5 a.u.  
Mechanism. -
A variety of mechanisms have been proposed 
for the metal-silicate fractionation, based on differences in 
density, brittleness, volatility, magnetic susceptibility, etc. 
(Urey, 1952b, 1956; Wood, 1962b). 
The last two seem especially 
promising. At higher pressures (e.g. 
10 -2 atm), iron condenses

ahead of Mg 2 SiO 4, MgSiO 3. 
If accretion is rapid, the innermost  
part of a growing planet may consist largely of nickel-iron.  
Such "inhomogeneous accretion" has recently been proposed for  
the terrestrial planets (Turekian and Clark, 1969). 
With pressures  
increasing toward the center of the solar nebula, one would expect  
metal contents to increase correspondingly, in accord with ob­
servation.  
For the chondrites, a different mechanism suggests itself,  
which may or may not be applicable to the planets. The Ni-content  
of the metal during metal-silicate fractionation seems to have  
been about 6.4% and 5.2% for 0 and E chondrites (Larimer and  
Anders, 1970). 
The ferromagnetic Curie points for these alloys,  
9000 and 940 0 K, lie only slightly below the upper temperature  
limits of 
10500 and 
985°K inferred from the Ge and Ga contents.  
Perhaps that is a coincidence but then it is hard to understand  
why the temperature had to fall 4000 after the refractory-element  
fractionation began. More probably, the relationship is causal,  
the fractionation being triggered by the appearance of ferromagnetism  
in the metal grains (Wood, 1962b).  
Harris and Tozer (1967) estimated that ferromagnetism would  
enlarge the,capture cross section of metal grains by a factor of  
2xl04 , causing them to aggregate rapidly to larger clumps.  
Separation from silicates might then be effected not only by  
differences in magnetic susceptibility but also by differences  
in size. 
Harris 
and 
Tozer's conclusions have 
been

challenged by Banerjee (1967) on the grounds that particles in  
- 
the size range considered by them (10- 4 to 10
3 cm) would be  
multi-domained and thus have only a negligible magnetic moment.

At 950°K, only particles between 1.8x10 
and 3.3xl0 
cm would  
have moments large enough to permit significant magnetostatic  
attraction. 
However, this happens to be just the size range of  
Fe304 particles in primitive chondrites [2xl0- 6 cm in Tieschitz  
(H3) and Renazzo (C2); Wood, 1962a; i-IOxI0 - 5 cm in Orgueil (Cl);  
Kerridge, 1970, private communication]. 
Though we have no data  
on the original particle size in more recrystallized chondrites,  
it is not unreasonable to suppose that it was in the same range.  
In any case., even a rather inefficient process would suffice  
to account for the fractionations in Table 1.  
It would be interesting to know what became of the iron­
poor material complementary to the inner planets. 
It may have  
been incorporated in the outer planets, expelled into interstellar  
space, or both.  
Fractionation of Volatiles; Temperature and  
Pressure in the Solar Nebula.  
Urey (1952a, b; 1954) was the first to note that volatile  
metals (Hg, Cd, etc.) might serve as "cosmothermometers" to  
determine the accretion temperature of meteorite parent bodies  
and the Earth. 
A careful analysis of the data then available  
showed no clear-cut evidence of significant depletion. Urey  
therefore concluded that both the Earth and meteorite parent

18 ­
bodies had accreted at a temperature of N300'K, not far from  
the present black-body temperature at 1 a.u. This concept of  
"cold accretion" became firmly established in planetary cosmogony.  
But the situation has changed in subsequent years. Pre­
cision measurements by neutron activation analysis showed that  
nearly all elements considered volatile by Urey were in fact  
underabundant; some by factors as large as 103, many others by  
smaller but nonetheless definite factors, e.g. 2 to 10 (Anders,  
1964; Larimer and Anders, 1967). 
The new data lead to a different  
and much more detailed picture of accretion conditions in the  
solar nebula.  
Abundance Patterns. - At last count, some 31 volatile  
elements appeared to be fractionated in chondrites. The simplest  
fractionation pattern is shown by carbonaceous chondrites (Figure  
2).  
'The elements are arranged in somewhat unconventional order,  
based on their depletion pattern in ordinary chondrites. 
Abun­
dances decrease consistently from Cl to C3, and by constant  
3  
factors as shown by the parallelism of the curves. 
This  
Apparent'exceptions occur at  Au, Cl and Br, but past experience  
suggests that at least the last two may be due to sampling or ana­
lytical errors. 
Some points, especially for Cl's, are based on  
only one or two measurements. The original.version of this graph  
(Figures 16a,b in Anders, 1964) contained many more irregularities  
and gaps, which gradually disappeared in subsequent versions

----- Page 21 (native) -----
-
19 -" 
parallelism extends to the last fiveelements on the graph­
though their absolute depletion is very much greater.  
Partial volatilization or condensation cannot account, for  
this pattern. The condensation curves in Figure 1 show clearly  
that there is no one temperature at which all elements will be­
condensed to the same fractional degree. Partial loss of a major  
phase (metal, sulfide, etc.) can also be ruled out, because the  
elements in Figure 2 differ greatly in geochemical character, and  
do not all reside in the same phase.  
In order to account for these trends, it seems necessary to  
postulate that C-chondrites are a mixture of two components: a  
high-temperature, volatile-free component, and a low-temperature,  
volatilerrich component (Wood, 1963; Anders, 1964). 
To explain  
the observed mean relative abundances (Cl:C2:C3 = 1.00.:0.55:0.32),  
one must postulate -100%, -55%. and -32% low-temperature material  
in the three types.  
(Figure 1, Larimer and Anders, 1967; Figure 3, Anders, 1968). 
In  
view of this secular trend, the irregularities at Cl and Br can  
perhaps be set aside for the time being.  
The situation for Au is unclear. The overall fractionation  
is smal-ler than that of the other elements in Figure 2, and may  
be due to some combination -of sampling and analytical errors,  
metal fractionation, etc. Moreover, Au is near the top of the  
condensation-sequence in Figure 1, where less complete depletion  
may be expected.

There exists some circumstantial evidence in favor of  
this model. Broadly speaking, the minerars of carbonaceous  
chondrites can be divided into two groups: 
high-temperature  
(olivine, pyrokene, metal) and low-temperature (hydrated silicates,  
MgSO4 , S, FeS, Fe3 0 4 ). Significantly, the observed content of  
low-temperature minerals in the three types agrees closely with  
the postulated content of low-temperature fraction, and so does  
the ratio of matrix to chondrules. 
Cl's consist almost entirely  
of a fine-grained matrix of low-temperature minerals; C3's consist  
mainly of chondrules of high-temperature minerals. Furthermore,  
there is'direct experimental evidence that chondrules and metal  
particles are depleted in volatile elements such as Na, Mn, and  
Ga, relative to matrix (Schmitt et al., 1965; Chou and Cohen,  
1970). 
This suggests that the low-temperature fraction may be  
identical with the matrix, and the high-temperature fraction,  
with chondrules-plus-metal-particles. 
(In much of our subsequent  
discussion we shall use the shorter term "chondrules" for  
"chondrules plus.metal particles of comparable ize").  
Formation of chondrules and matrix. - Several possibilities  
exist for the formation of chondrules and matrix in the nebula.  
Wood (1958, 1962b, 1963) suggested that they might represent  
material from two different condensation paths. 
Condensation of  
vapor to solid would give submicron-sized smoke (= matrix), while  
condensation of vapor to liquid would give droplets that might  
grow to millimeter-sized chondrules by coalescence. With -105 times

----- Page 23 (native) -----

21 ­
- I0  
the radius~of-matrix grains, chondrules would have only 10 
times the specific surface area and hence be far less efficient  
collectors of volatiles under conditions where surface area is  
the governing factor (Figure la). 
Similarly, they would take  
1010 times longer to reach diffusional equilibrium, and would  
thus be correspondingly less efficient where such equilibration  
is the determining factor (Figure lb).  
Qualitatively Wood's model is most satisfactory, as it  
accounts for the main structural 
components of chondrites and  
their chemical differences. 
Quantitatively it is in some trouble,  
however. 
Condensation of magnesium silicates and nickel-iron  
from a cosmic gas requires pressures of 10 to 103 atm (Suess,  
1963; Wood, 1963), far higher than those expected in the solar  
nebula. One alternative is that the primordial condensate was  
entirely dust, and that some fraction of it was remelted to  
chondrules by electric discharges or shock waves (Whipple, 1966;  
Cameron, 1966). 
At pressures outside the liquid field of the  
phase diagram (i.e. <100 atm) molten droplets are of course  
unstable with respect to vapor, but if the remelting events are  
of a purely local scale, droplets may freeze before they have  
completely evaporated. 
Indeed, petrographers have agreed for  
over a century that the texture of chondrules indicates rapid  
crystallization.  
Another alternative is that condensation did not proceed  
under equilibriim conditions but involved supercooling and

----- Page 24 (native) -----
-
22 ­
metastability. Blander and Katz (1967) have argued that liquids  
are easier to nucleate than solids; thus much of the silicate  
nondensing, from the gas even at low pressures might be a meta­
stable.liquid rather than a stable solid. Once crystallization  
is initiated by some chance event, the droplet would of course  
freeze rapidly.  
Temperatures and Pressures. - Whatever the nature of the  
chondrule-forming process, it is instructive to compare the  
abundance patterns in chondrites with the predictions of the con­
densation diagram (Figure 1). 
For each of the two fractions,  
one can determine a "condensation temperature", defined as the  
temperature at which the solid grains ceased to equilibrate with  
the gas. 
(Under conditions of slow cooling, such equilibration  
would normally terminate with accretion. 
In that case, these  
temperatures may be interpreted as accretion temperatures). 
If  
condensation indeed proceeded according to Figure 1, temperatures  
derived from different elements should be concordant, and consistent  
with other evidence.  
. 
It appears that the high-temperature fraction is best ex­
plained- in terms of Figure la; and the low-temperature fraction, 
in terms of. Figure lb. This is not surprising in view of the 
differences in grain-size noted above. 
The high-temperature fraction of C chondrites contains  
magnesium silicates and nickel-iron but is depleted in all elements  
from Mn on down. This is readily understood in terms of Figure la

----- Page 25 (native) -----
23 ­
(but not ib), for a condensation temperature of 1150-12500 K.  
The low-temperature fraction, on the other hand, contains its  
full complement of even the highly volatile metals Pb, Bi, TI,  
and In. By either diagram, this implies an accretion temperature  
of <400'K. A value of the same order can be independently  
estimated from the presence of magnetite and hydrated.silicates  
in C chondrites. The formation temperature of hydrated silicates  
is not well known and can only be roughly estimated as 300-3500 K.  
But the formation temperature of Fe304 is 400 0K in a cosmic gas,  
and is independent of pressure (Urey, 1952b).  
The ordinary chondrites'(dashed line in.Figure .2)show  
a somewhat different trend, implying different condensation and  
.accretion temperatures: 
[Only mean abundances are plotted here.  
Actually, the range of variation is quite large, chondrites of  
lower petrologic types generally being richer in volatile  
elements (Figure 4, Anders, 1968; Figure 1, Keays et al., .1971)].  
Nine elements from Cu to Se parallel the C2 and C3 curves. Though  
the 3 segments are not particularly flat in this region, their  
parallelism suggests that they reflect the same process. Any  
deviation from horizontality is probably due to errors in the  
Cl data used for normalization. 
It therefore seems likely that  
the ordinary chondrites, too, are a mixture of two components.  
The mean depletion factor between Cu and Se (using the latest  
data, J.C. Laul, private communication, and omitting Au; cf.  
footnote 3) is 0.24, which suggests a matrix content of 24%.

----- Page 26 (native) -----
-
24 -
The remaining elements deviate from the C2, 3 pattern.  
Mn, Na, K, and Rb are essentially undepleted, while Cs and the  
elements from Te to TI show progressively greater depletion. The  
first trend suggests a lower condensation temperature of the high­
temperature fraction, e.g. 1000'K vs 11500 to 1250'K, or a higher  
pressure. The second trend suggests a higher accretion tempera­
ture of the low-temperature fraction, within the region of  
partial condensation. Unfortunately, condensation curves are  
available for only 4 of the 13 strongly depleted elements (Ag,  
Pb, Bi, and Ti), owing to lack of thermodynamic data or complexity  
of chemical equilibria. The curve for a fifth element, In, has  
been estimated indirectly (Keays et al., 1971).  
Attempts to determine accretion temperatures from Bi, TI,  
and In contents have been made by Larimer (1970) and Keays et  
al. (1971),; 
Data for 11 L-chondrites are shown in Table 2.  
Though there are minor discrepancies among the three "cosmo­
thermometers", all three give fairly similar results. Accretion  
temperatures lie in a surprisingly narrow, 100-degree interval  
centered on 510 0K, and increase with petrologic type. Temperatures  
derived from Pb contents lie in the same range (Larimer, 1970).  
Thd above temperature estimates are based on pressure­
dependent condensation curves and may thus be in error if the  
- 
pressure differed greatly from the assumed value of 10
atm.  
However, at least fdr the L-chondrites the uncertainty in pressure  
is only two orders of magnitude in either direction, corresponding

----- Page 27 (native) -----
-
25 ­
to a temperature error of +80, -60 degrees (Keays et al., 1971).  
2 
- 6 
At pressures of 10-
or 10
atm, calculated Bi-Ti correlation  
4  
curves fit the data noticeably less well than at 10-
atm. More­
over, all chondrites contain FeS, whose formation temperature  
-2  
(680'K) is pressure-independent. 
At a pressure of .10 
atm,  
the condensation curves of Bi and Ti are shifted upward suffi­
ciently to imply accretion temperatures greater than 680'K  
for the more strongly depleted Type 6's. 
Such meteorites then  
should contain no FeS, contrary to observation. Similarly, a  
- 6 
7 
lower limit of 10
to 10-
atm can be inferred from the absence  
of Fe30 4 (formation temperature, 400'K) from all but the least  
recrystallized and least-depleted Type 3's. Thus the pressure  
4 ± 2 
in the region of the L-chondrites apparently was 10-
atm. 
It  
will be of interest to extend this treatment to other chondrite  
classes.  
It is remarkable that temperatures as high as 500-'K pre­
vailed during accretion of the meteorite parent bodies, because  
the present black-body temperature at 2.8 a.u. is only 170 0 K.  
Thus a powerful,, transient heat source must have been present.  
One possibility is the Hayashi stage of the Sun; another is the  
collapse stage of the nebula which would release vast amounts  
of gravitational potential energy over a short span of time  
(Cameron, 1962, 1963, 1969). 
Indeed, the temperatures inferred  
for the dust shells or disks surrounding proto-stars are of the  
right order: 
1850 to 350 0K for VY Canis Majoris (Herbig, 1970b)  
and -8500K for R Monocerotis and other infrared stars (Low and  
Smith, 1966; Low, 1969). 
Perhaps it will soon be possible to

-
26 ­
compare time, temperature, and pressure estimates from meteorites  
with observational and theoretical data for proto-stars.  
Planets. - There is some indication that the bulk of the  
accretion in the inner solar system took place between 500 and  
7000K. Only 5-10% of the ordinary chondrites are Type 3's which  
accreted below 500 0K, and few if any meteorites have the FeS­
free, but otherwise chondritic composition expected for material  
accreted above 6800K. The Earth, too, seems to contain substantial  
amounts of FeS (Anderson et al., 1970), and resembles 04-06  
chondrites in the abundance of volatile elements (Anders, 1968;  
Larimer, 1971). 
There are two limiting interpretations for this  
pattern: 
accretion at a constant temperature of -5500K or at  
falling temperatures from>700 to _350°K. 
In the latter case,  
a large part of the volatiles may have been brought in as a thin  
veneer of carbonaceous-chondrite-like material, swept up by the  
Earth in the final stage of accretion..  
We are continuing to use the term "accretion temperatures"  
although strictly speaking, these are temperatures of equilibration  
with the nebula. 
For a large planet, the former are much higher,  
owing to the release of gravitational potential energy during  
accretion. This has little effect on composition, though, because  
escape of volatiles during accretion of an earth-sized planet is  
unlikely.

----- Page 29 (native) -----

27 - 
The Moon seems to be depleted in volatiles by another two  
orders of magnitude relative to the Earth (Ganapathy et al.,  
1970; Laul et al., 1970;,Anders, -1970).. In terms of the preceding  
two models, this may imply either accretion at a higher temperature  
(650 to 700'K), or a much lower accretion efficiency in the final  
stages of formation, when volatile-rich material was being swept  
up. 
Ganapathy et al. (1970) and Anders (1970) have suggested  
that such inefficient accretion might result if the Moon formed  
in the Earth's neighborhood, but Singer and Bandermann (1970)  
have shown that quite the opposite effect would be expected, at  
least in the absence of gas.  
Material balance. -
The fate of the lost volatiles remains  
laregly undetermined. 
A few of the most volatile elements (In, Bi,  
Tl, Cs, and Br) are occasionally enriched in 03 chondrites. Such  
enrichment might be expected in the final stages of accretion when  
the gas phase had become enriched in volatiles left, behind by  
the previously accreted O4's-06's. 
An even more striking enrich­
ment is shown by mercury, thought to be the most volatile of  
all metals (Urey, 1952b, 1954). 
It is enriched in C-chondrites  
by 1-2 orders of magnitude above cosmic levels and is only slightly  
depleted in O-chondrites (Reed and Jovanovic, 1967; Ehmann and  
Lovering, 1967). 
Larimer and Anders (1967) have tried to explain  
the "mercury paradox" by postulating the existence of a relatively

----- Page 30 (native) -----
-
28 ­
involatile mercury compound, but Arrhenius and Alfv6n (1970)  
have proposed an attractive alternative. 
If condensation took  
place from a partially ionized plasma, mercury, because of its  
high ionization potential, would be neutralized ahead of most  
other elements, thus becoming available for condensation at an  
earlier stage.  
Some part of the volatiles may have been lost with the  
gases during dissipation of the solar nebula. Hence it seems  
unlikely that the average composition of all meteorites is close  
to cosmic. 
Meteorites apparently did not evolve in a closed  
system. 
Other models. -
Alternative explanations have been offered 
for the trace element depletion in ordinary chondrites. Tandon 
and Wasson (1968) suggested that the most volatile elements were 
contained largely in a third component, which becomes increasingly 
abundant in the lower petrologic types. Blander and Abdel-Gawad  
(1969) proposed instead a multi-component model, according to  
which each chondrite contains a variety of materials covering a  
range of grain sizes and condensation temperatures. Neither of  
these models predicts a simple relationship between abundance  
and temperature, let alone concordance of temperatures derived  
from different elements (Table 2). 
There are other objections  
to these more complex models (Keays et al., 1971), and it seems  
that there is no need at present to go beyond the simple two­
component model.

State of Oxidation  
Chondrites differ strikingly in degree of oxidation, as 
reflected by the partition of iron between metal (plus sulfide) 
and silicates (Table 1). 
A convenient index of oxidation level 
is the iron content of the principal silicates, olivine and 
pyroxene. 
It is usually given as the atom percentage of Fe2+ 
in the mineral, using abbreviations Fa and Fs for the iron 
endmembers of the solid solution. Thus Fa1 8 means 
2+ 2+ 
2± 
Fe2+/(Fe2 + + Mg )olivine = 0.18. 
Each of the five chondrite classes covers a narrow, 
characteristic range of iron contents (Table 1, Column 6), 
separated by well-marked hiatuses. 
The equilibrated members of 
each class fall wholly within this range. The unequilibrated 
chondrites contain minerals of widely varying iron contents, but 
their mean iron content generally falls close to that of their 
equilibrated counterparts (Dodd et al., 1967). 
Ordinary chondrites. -
Silicates condensed from a hot 
cosmic gas are expected to have very low iron contents, less 
than 1%. 
For this reason some authors have assumed that the 
high Fe 
contents of ordinary chondrites were established in 
a non-cosmic environment, i.e. the meteorite parent bodies or 
a fractionated region of the solar nebula (Suess, 1964, 1965; 
Ringwood, 1966; Wood, 1967a). Blander and Katz (1967), on the 
2+
other hand, have pointed out that high Fe 
contents might arise  
even by condensation from the solar nebula if the nucleation of

----- Page 32 (native) -----
-
30 ­
metallic iron were kinetically inhibited. Under these conditions,  
the partial pressure of iron vapor remains orders of magnitude  
above the equilibrium value, causing a proportionate increase  
2+ 
in the Fe 
content of the silicates.  
A simpler alternative is equilibration of the condensate  
with the neburar gas upon cooling. Under equilibrium conditions,  
iron-bearing olivine is produced by the reaction:  
MgSiO 3 + Fe + H20 V 
Mg2SiO
+ jFe 2SiO 4 + H 2 
(1)  
The iron content of the pyroxene, in turn, is coupled to that  
of the olivine by the exchange equilibrium:  
Mg 2 SiO 4 + FeSiO3 
i! MgSiO 3 + Fe 2 SiO 4 
(2)  
4  
Larimer (1968a) has considered these equilibria in detail  
and predicts the following olivine compositions in a solar gas  
of H2 /H 2 0 = 500:  
T (OK) 
1400

87  
The olivine compositions in equilibrated ordinary chondrites  
(Fa1 6 to Fa3 1 , Table 1) thus seem to point to equilibrium near  
600 0 K. 
Reaction rates are probably fast enough to permit estab­
lishment of equilibrium at these low temperatures. The equili­
bration process involves transfer of iron from metal to silicate  
grains, which can proceed by solid-state diffusion if the grains  
are in contact or by vapor-phase transport if they are not.  
5 
For t = 10 yr and a grain diameter of 10-
cm (probably

----- Page 33 (native) -----
-
31 ­
representative of matrix particles) the diffusion mechanism  
may be effective to -6300 K. 
The limit for vapor phase transport  
is less certain, but should be of the same order if volatile  
iron species such as FeC12 were present.  
If this dust is to be transformed into chondrules of the  
2+  
same Fe 
content, it is obviously necessary that no appreciable  
reduction take place during remelting. This appears to be  
feasible. Reduction requires that a sufficient number of H 2  
molecules from the gas phase impinge on the surface of the  
molten chondrule. A minimum half-life for Fe 2 + reduction can  
be estimated on the assumption that every impact is effective  
and that any iron reduced at the surface is instantly replaced  
2+ 
-4 
by fresh Fe 
from the interior. At P = 10 
atm and T = 1200 0 K,  
this minimum half-life is 
10 sec for 1 mm chondrules, of the  
same order as the freezing time (seconds to minutes). 
But the  
actual half-life is likely to be orders of magnitude longer and  
thus the average degree of reduction will remain slight. 
Indi­
vidual chondrules should of course vary, depending on their  
cooling times, and such variations have in fact been observed  
in primitive chondrites (Fa_0 to Fa90 in 03's, Van Schmus, 1969;  
Fa0.1 to Fa69 in C2's, Wood, 1967a).  
-
It thus appears that the oxidation state of ordinary 
chondrites was established directly in the solar nebula, by 
equilibration of the primary condensate with the gas at _600 0 K. 
Enstatite chondrites. - These meteorites are much more  
strongly reduced. 
They contain almost iron-free MgSiO 3  
(Fs0.1-2 ) and minerals such as graphite, FeSi, TiN, and CaS,

----- Page 34 (native) -----
-
32 ­
which are stable only under very reducing conditions. 
It appears  
that these facts cannot be explained by temperature alone; the  
gas phase must have been more reducing than cosmic. Larimer  
(1968b) investigated the thermodynamics in detail and noted  
that the requisite degree of reducing power could be achieved  
most simply by a slight increase in C/O ratio, from the solar  
value of -0.6 to about 0.9 or 1.0. 
It is well known from  
stellar spectra and thermodynamic calculations (Suess, 1962;  
Tsuji, 1964; Dayhoff et al., 1964; Dolan, 1965; Morris and  
Wyller, 1967) that drastic chemical changes take place when the  
C/O ratio in a'hot cosmic gas approaches unity. The bulk of  
the oxygen is tied up as CO and metal oxides, while H20 virtually  
disappears. 
Since the reducing power of the gas depends on the  
H2 /H20 ratio, various reduced species become prominent.  
-
Larimer suggested that the increased C/O ratio might be  
achi~ved by a slight local enrichment of dust relative to gas,  
if the dust contained some carbon. Direct condensation of  
carbon from a solar gas (as graphite or a solid solution in  
metallic iron) requires rather specialized, though not impossible  
conditions (Urey, 1953; Eck et al., 1966). 
Yet the high C/O ratio  
would have to persist from _10 00°K (where silicates otherwise begin  
to take up significant amounts of Fe2 +) to 600-700°K (temperature of  
metal-silicate fractionation and chondrule formation). 
It is not  
clear that prolonged survival of large, compositionally peculiar  
regions in the solar nebula is in fact plausible.  
Alternative models for the enstatite chondrites have  
been proposed, involving either reduction of carbon-rich dust  
in the parent body (Ringwood, 1966) or condensation from a

----- Page 35 (native) -----
-
33 ­
cosmic gas supersaturated in Fe vapor at pressures greater than  
- 
10 2 atm (Blander, 1970). 
All of these models need, to be  
explored further.  
Oxidation State During Metal-Silicate Fractionation. - 
Conditions during this fractionation can be estimated from a  
plot of Ni/Mg vs Fe/Mg for a group of cogenetic meteorites.  
The slope gives Ni/Fe in metal and the intercept,. Fe/Mg in  
silicate during fractionation. The latter ratio can of course  
be related to temperature.  
Larimer and Anders (1970) have determined these quantities  
for 0, E, and C chondrites, on the assumption that all members  
of each class are cogenetic. The Fe2+/Mg2 + ratio for 0 chondrites  
2± 
2i  
is 0.14±0.02, corresponding to T 
700±150 K. The Fe /Mg  
ratio of 0.14 is slightly lower than the present value, suggesting  
that the fractionation happened shortly before the final stage  
of oxidation. The ratios for E and C chondrites (0.00±0.07 and  
0.14±0.08) have larger errors and hence cannot be used for  
meaningful temperature estimates.  
Organic Matter.  
Carbonaceous chondrites contain up to 47 carbon. Most  
of it is in the form of an insoluble, aromatic polymer somewhat  
similar to coal or to humic acid in soils. The remainder consists  
of Mg, Fe, and Ca carbonates and a variety of organic compounds.  
Ordinary chondrites contain smaller amounts of carbon (0.01% to  
2%) in an ill-defined chemical form, presumably again an aromatic

.polymer (Hayes and Biemann, 1968).  
The nature and origin of meteoritic organic matter has  
been reviewed by Hayes (1967), Vdovykin (1967), and Levin (1969).  
From the standpoint of the present review, the principal question  
is whether the organic matter represents a primary condensate  
from the solar nebula or a secondary product.  
Urey (1953) investigated the thermodynamics of carbon  
condensation from the solar nebula, and showed that simple,  
non-volatile substances (graphite, Fe3C) could condense only  
under very specialized and somewhat improbable conditions. At  
- 3 
moderate temperatures (<500-600'K at <10
atm), methane is the  
dominant form of carbon, but is far too volatile to condense  
in the inner solar system (Tc = 48°K at 10-3 atm). 
Urey there­
fore suggested that the primary-condensate consisted of "complex,  
tarry carbon compounds" similar to those in carbonaceous chon­
drites. Such compounds might form as metastable intermediates  
in the transformation of CO, the stable high-temperature form  
of C in the solar nebula, to CH4, the stable low-temperature  
form.  
Much detailed information on the organic compounds in  
meteorites has subsequently become available. We can therefore  
try to reconstruct the processes that led' to the formation of  
these compounds, and see what relationship they bear to the  
primary condensation process.  
The study of organic compounds in meteorites has been somewhat  
hampered by contamination, but the isotopic composition of H, S, and C

35 -,  
shows that the major part of the organic.matter is indigenous  
(Briggs, 1963). 
Surprisingly, the compound distribution  
is far from random. A few classes or structural types dominate:  
for example, straight-chain hydrocarbohs- are far more abundant  
than their branched-chain counterparts, although the straight­
chain configuration is only one of. 103 to 10 structural possi­
bilities for molecules with 15 to 20 carbon atoms. Apparently  
some highly selective synthesis-process was- at work.  
A mechanism of the right degree of selectivity is the  
Fischer-Tropsch reaction: -hydrogenation of CO in the presence  
of an iron or cobalt catalyst. This reaction, which is used  
industrially, produces mainly straight-chain or slightly branched  
hydrocarbons of the general formula CnH2n+2, e.g.  
-
10CO + 21H 2 
" C10H22 + 10H 2 0 
The hydrocarbon distribution resembles that in meteorites  
(Figure 3) and in certain oil shales and natural gases (Studier  
et al., 1968; Friedel and Sharkey, 1968). 
When NH3 is present  
in the gas mixture, various nitrogen compounds are produced,  
including some of biological significance (adenine, guanine,  
cytosine; the constituent bases of DNA and RNA), and other  
structurally similar ones (ammeline, melamine) without such  
significance (Hayatsu et al., 1968). 
The same compounds have  
been found in carbonaceous chondrites (Hayatsu, 1964).  
A further argument for the Fischer-Tropsch reaction comes

----- Page 38 (native) -----
-
36 ­
from the isotopic differences between, carbonate carbon  
(= bonded to 0, e.g. MgCO3 ) and organic carbon (= bonded to  
H, e.g. CxHy) in carbonaceous chondrites. 
Clayton (1963)  
showed that the carbonate carbon was some 7 to 8% richer in  
C1 3  than the organic carbon (Briggs, 1963). 
This trend was  
confirmed by Krouse and Modzeleski (1970) and Smith and Kaplan  
(1970). 
Although fractionations of this magnitude are theo­
retically possible under equilibrium conditions at very low  
temperatures ( 0C), they are not observed in nature. Urey  
(1967) therefore proposed that the two types of carbon came from  
two unrelated reservoirs. 
It turns out, however, that the  
Fischer-Tropsch reaction gives an isotopic fractionation of  
just the right sign and magnitude at 400'K (but not 500'K),  
owing to a kinetic isotopic effect (Lancet and Anders, 1970).  
The temperature of -4000K agrees fairly well with the accretion  
temperature of C2 chondrites estimated from their volatile  
element content.  
An alternative mechanism that has frequently been proposed  
for the prebiotic synthesis of organic compounds on Earth is  
the Miller-Urey reaction: 
irradiation of CH4, NH3, and H20 by  
UV, y-rays, etc. (Miller, 1953; see Lemmon, 1970, for a recent  
review). 
However, this reaction involves random link-up of  
free radicals, and therefore lacks the required selectivity.  
It produces all hydrocarbon isomers in comparable amounts, without  
preference for straight-chain isomers, and does not yield many

----- Page 39 (native) -----
-
37 ­
of the heterocyclic or aromatic compounds found in meteorites.  
Moreover, the Miller-Urey reaction does not give significant  
carbon isotope fractionations.  
Although the Fischer-Tropsch reaction seems capable of  
accounting for much of the evidence, there is as yet no certainty  
that conditions in the solar nebula were in fact appropriate  
for this reaction. To be sure, a variety of suitable catalysts  
(nickel-iron, Fe304, hydrated silicates) were undoubtedly present,  
and so were at least two of the three reactants (NH3, H2).  
Problems arise for the third reactant, CO, however. 
In a  
cooling solar nebula it should be abundant down to 600K.  
But below this temperature, it becomes unstable, first with  
respect to CH4, and only later (at temperatures 1000 to 1500  
'lower) with respect to higher hydrocarbons. Thus, if equilibrium  
were maintained, most of the CO would be converted to CH4  
before .formation of heavier hydrocarbons became possible.  
In order to resolve this dtfficulty, Lancet and Anders  
(1970) postulated that the hydrogenation of CO might have been  
very sluggish until 4000K, when magnetite began to form. At  
that temperature, both CH4 and heavier hydrocarbons are thermo­
dynamically possible products; the iatter actually form more  
readily for mechanistic reasons. In support of this suggestion  
they noted that significant amounts of organic compounds are  
found only in meteorites containing magnetite.  
The survival of any heavy hydrocarbons formed also presents  
problems. These compounds are unstable with respect to CH4 in

----- Page 40 (native) -----
the presence of excess H2 . Studier et al. (1968) have shown  
that this reaction does not proceed to a perceptible degree  
during several days at 500°K and P = 10 atm. 
It is not known,  
however, whether this is sufficient to ensure survival of hydro­
carbons at the lower temperatures, lower pressures, and longer  
times characteristic of the solar nebula.  
Likewise, the reaction has not yet been carried out at  
- 
the high H2/CO ratios (_10.3) and low pressures (l0 
atm)  
appropriate to the solar nebula, because the carbon content of  
such a system would be too small for present analytical techniques.  
Of the two variables, pressure seems to be the more critical  
one. Studier et al. (1968) were able to synthesize hydrocarbons  
at H2/CO = 500 and P = 10 atm, but saw no detectable reaction  
- 
10 2  
in gas mixtures of lower H2/CO ratio during several days at  
-3  
or 10 
atm.  
Another unsolved problem is the origin of the aromatic  
polymer. Calculations by Dayhoff et al. (1964) show that  
aromatic hydrocarbons of high molecular weight might form  
metastably in systems of low H/C ratio, and this has been con­
firmed experimentally by Eck et al. (1966). 
A similar process  
seems to be involved in the transformation of terrestrial  
plant remains to coal, and might also occur if the hydrocarbons  
first formed were reheated in the meteorite parent body after  
accretion. Some features of the hydrocarbon distribution in  
meteorites actually seem to call for such reheating (Studier

----- Page 41 (native) -----
-
39 ­
et al., 1968). 
However, no material resembling the meteoritic  
polymer has yet been synthesized in the laboratory.  
Summarizing the situation, we can thus state that the  
Fischer-Tropsch reaction (perhaps augmented by radiation chemis­
try and reheating) seems to be a likely mechanism for production  
of the organic compounds in meteorites. Whether this reaction  
is indeed the primary condensation process sought is less  
certain. One cannot yet rule out the possibility that the  
primary condensate was made by some other process (Miller-Urey?),  
and transformed to Fischer-Tropsch material by secondary reactions  
in the meteorite parent bodies. 
Such transformations are in  
fact observed on earth. The hydrocarbon distribution in some  
crude oils, coals, and oil shales is strikingly similar to a  
Fischer-Tropsch distribution (Figure 3) although these hydro­
-carbons are obviously made by subterranean degradation of  
biological material (Friedel and Sharkey, 1963, 1968). 
Apparently  
the Fischer-Tropsch pathway is kinetically favored over competing  
mechanisms in .a wide range of conditions. Thus the Fischer- 
Tropsch compounds in meteorites may be of secondary origin.  
This problem may soon be resolved by radio astronomers.  
The organic molecules of growing complexity discovered in inter­
stellar clouds (Palmer and Zuckerman, 1971) seem to require forma­
tion in an environment far denser than the cloud itself, i.e.  
stellar envelopes or "solar nebulae" (Herbig, 1970). 
These  
compounds almost certainly were made by the "primary" process of

----- Page 42 (native) -----

carbon condensation. 
As the list of positive (and negative!)  
identifications grows longer, it may provide a decisive clue  
to the nature of the primary process.  
Primordial Noble Gases.  
Some meteorites contain remarkably large amounts of  
noble gases whose isotopic composition clearly rules out a  
radiogenic or cosmogenic origin. Such gases have been called  
"primordial" or "trapped" (Gerling and Levskii, 1956; Zahringer,  
1962; Suess et al., 1964; see Pepin and Signer, 1965, for a  
review). 
It has gradually become apparent that there exist two  
varieties of primordial gas. 
The first, called "solar", con­
tains the noble gases in nearly solar proportions, and is charac­
terized by He and Ne relatively rich in the light isotope:

; Ne 
/Ne 
= 12.5±0.2 (Jeffery and 
Anders, 1970; Black and Pepin, 1969). 
Solar gas is'found 
sporadically in meteorites of all classes, is always associated  
with shock and brecciation, and seems to represent trapped solar  
wind particles (Wa.nke, 1965). 
Some authors have proposed that  
the trapping took place before accretion of the meteorite  
parent bodies (Pellas et al., 1969; Lal et al., 1969), but the  
discovery oT a similar gas component in lunar soil and breccias  
suggests that the implantation is an ongoing process in the  
solar system.  
The second, "planetary" component seems to be of much

----- Page 43 (native) -----
-
41 ­
more ancient origin. 
It is disproportionally enriched in the  
heavier noble gases (not unlike the.Earth's atmosphere), and  
contains lesser amounts of the light isotopes of He and Ne­

It is found 
only in "primitive" meteorites, e.g. chondrites and ureilites.  
[The latter, though classified as achondrites, are the least  
differentiated members of that class. Their high C content and  
o18/0 16 ratio links them to the carbonaceous chondrites, and  
some authors believe that they are derived from them by a simple  
alteration process (Anders, 1964; Vdovykin, 1970)].  
There is evidence-for several additional types of neon,  
with Ne20/Ne 22  3.4, 11.25±0.25, and ;14 (Black and Pepin, 1969;  
Black, 1971). 
The first two are always associated with planetary  
neon, but the second is not quite firmly established: 
it may  
be a mixture of the.8..2 and 12.5 components. The third component  
seems to be associated with solar gas, but its reality is not  
yet settled.  
We shall be concerned only with the planetary gas, as  
it alone seems to date from the nebular stage. Three properties  
need to be explained: 
amounts, elemental ratios, and isotopic  
ratios.  
The amounts of planetary gas show a most remarkable  
correlation with petrologic type, among both the ordinary and  
al, 
carbonaceous chondrites (Zihringer, 1966; Marti, 1967; Mazor et  
1970). 
Absolute abundances of Ar, Kr, Xe rise by three ordersof

magnitude from 06 to Cl chondritesorureilites.

different behavior: 
they are found only in Cl,C2's 'and a few  
03's). 
Elemental ratios of the heavier gases (Ar/Kr, Ar/Xe) remain  
constant within a factor 6 over the entire range.  
A rather common view is that planetary gases reflect  
some kind of solubility equilibrium between nebula and solid  
phase, perhaps modified by adsorption effects. The equilibrium  
solubilityof these gases may be expected to follow Henry's law,  
the amount of dissolved gas at a given temperature being propor­
tional to its partial pressure. Unfortunately there exist no  
published data on equilibrium solubility of noble gases in  
meteoritic minerals at the pertinent temperatures ( 300 to  
600'K; see above). 
Kirsten (1968) has measured solubilities  
in enstatite at 17730 K, near its freezing point. The distribu­
-5 
3  
tion coefficient for Ar, for example, was 2x10 
cm STP/g atm.  
In order to account for the amounts of planetary Ar in 05,6  
chondrites, the distribution coefficient at lower temperatures  
i5+2 
p±l-4+2  
would have to be some 10 
times greater (if Pt=lO 
atm.)  
The only pertinent experimental data are some unpublished  
measurements by M.S.Lancet (quoted by Jeffery and Anders, 1970).  
The distribution coefficient of Ar in magnetite is about  
1 cc STP/g atm at 500'K. This is some 5x104 times higher than  
Kirsten's value for enstatite at 1773 0K, and only slightly less  
than the value required to account for the Ar3 6 content of 05,6  
chondrites. Solubilities for He and Ne are markedly lower, so  
that magnetite equilibrating with "solar" noble gases should

----- Page 45 (native) -----
-
43­
absorb them in approximately planetary proportions.  
The question is far from settled, ,however. No solubility  
data are, available for Kr and Xe, or for meteoritic minerals  
other than magnetite. 
It is not at all certain.that these  
solubilities will be of the right order to account for the  
evidence. Xenon, in particular, is a problem. The observed  
amount of Xe in C3 chondrites, for example, requires a distribu­
3 
tion coefficient of .1052 cm
STP/g atm, corresponding to a  
number density in the solid some 3X105±2 higher than in the gas.  
This implies a rather strong bond between Xe and the host lattice,  
corresponding to a heat of solution of about -20 to -25 kcal/mole.  
Perhaps adsorption on a growing crystal was involved as a first  
step. The density of atoms in an adsorbed layer can approach  
that in a liquid, and even if only a fraction of the adsorbed atoms  
are trapped in the growing crystal, quite high gas concentrations  
can result.  
An interesting alternative has been proposed by Jokipii  
(1964):' enrichment of the heavier gases by ambipolar diffusion.  
In a pirtially ionized solar nebula, the solar magnetic field  
would retard ions relative to neutral atoms. 'Thus the heavier  
noble gases, with their lower ionization potentials, would  
be preferentially retained in the inner solar system. Calculated  
enrichment factors indeed agree rather well with terrestrial  
atmospheric abundances. This process can also lead to highly  
efficient trapping of the retained gases, if the ions are

accelerated and implanted in solid grains.  
The isotopic differences between solar and planetary gas  
have been the subject of much speculation (Pepin and Signer,  
1965; Black and Pepin, 1969; Mazor et al., 1970; 
Black, 1971).  
Some of the obvious possibilities, such as mass fractionation by  
gravitational escape (Krummenacher et al., 1962) or diffusion  
from a solid lattice (Zlhringer, 1962) seem rather unlikely,  
because the elemental and isotopic ratios do not show the ex­
pected correlations (Pepin, 1967; Jeffery and Anders, 1970).  
The existence of a neon, component-with Ne20/Ne2 2 <3.5 (Black  
and Pepin, 1969) is a particularly strong argument against these  
models, because production of this component from solar neon  
20 
22  
with Ne /Ne 
= 12.5 requires an implausibly high fractionation

factor, 10 12.  
No wholly satisfactory explanation is yet available.  
The most plausible mechanism is production of 2.6 yr Na2 2 in  
meteoritic silicates by a charged-particle irradiation in the  
22  
solar nebula, followed by in situ decay to Ne 
The amount

of Na 
produced, and hence the final Ne

ratio, might  
vary with the composition of the mineral (Jeffery and Anders,  
3

1970). 
The variations in He /He , on the other hand, might  
represent a secular increase in the He3 abundance at the solar  
surface (E. Schatzmann, private communication quoted by  
Eberhardt et al., 1970). 
The ratio may have changed from

in recent times.-
[The  
"recent" ratio is not well-defined; variations were predicted  
owing to differential acceleration of He3 and He4 (Geiss et al.,  
1970a) and have been confirmed by measurements on Apollo 11,12  
lunar soils and Al-foil solar-wind collectors (Geiss et al.,  
1970b)].  
CHRONOLOGY OF THE SOLAR NEBULA  
It has been clear for more than a decade that the active  
period of planet formation lasted no more than-a few hundred  
million years--a few percent of the age of the solar system  
(Urey, 1957). 
The obvious challenge to meteoriticists was to  
determine the length of this interval with greater accuracy,  
and to resolve individual events within this interval. At  
first, all such efforts were based on "extinct" radionuclides  
with half-lives of 107 to 108 yr, e.g. 16 Myr 1129 and 82 Myr  
Pu2 4 4  (Reynolds, 1968; Hohenberg et al., 1967). 
But more recently,  
some spectacular advances were made in the Rb87-Sr8 7 dating  
method (Papanastassiou and Wasserburg, 1969). 
In spite of the  
long half-life of Rb8 7 (47 AE), improved mass spectrometric  
techniques now permit resolution of time differences as small as  
+2 Myr.  
The picture still is quite fragmentary, owing to the  
lack of a common reference point. 
All of the methods used measure  
time intervals between two events, but the events themselves  
differ from method to method.

Rubidium-87. -
Seven eucrites (Ca-rich achondrites  
of very low Rb content) fall on a well-defined isochron, the  
maximum deviation being 6x10 - 5 . This implies that if these  
meteorites were derived from material with chondritic Rb/Sr  
ratio (0.25), they must have formed within <4 Myr of each other  
(Papanastassiou and Wasserburg, 1969).  
This result would be trivial if all these meteorites  
came from a single lava flow. However, this is rather unlikely.  
Two of the'seven meteorites (Stannern and Moore County) differ  
from the others in composition or texture. Moreover, the  
radiation ages of these meteorites suggest that they originated  
in at least 4 and perhaps 7 separate impacts (Heymann et al.,  
1968). 
Thus it seems that the 4 Myr isochronism applies to  
an event of more than local scale. 
It is interesting in-this  
connection -that at least one asteroid, Vesta, has a reflection  
spectrum 'suggestive of a eucritic composition (McCord et al.,  
1970).-
The Rb/Sr method has also provided an estimate for the  
duration of metamorphic heating in chondrite parent bodies. An  
analysis of the H 6 chondrite Guarena showed that it had a-higher  
Sr87/Sr8 6 ratio than the eucrites when its minerals ceased to  
exchange Rb and Sr (Wasserburg et al., 1969).. The time required  
to evolve Guarefia Sr from eucritic Sr is 74±12 Myr, and probably  
reflects the duration of metamorphism in this meteorite.  
Iodine-129. - In the decade since its inception, the  
I129/Xe1 2 9 dating method has gone through several stages of

----- Page 49 (native) -----
-
47 ­
refinement, as certain pitfalls were recognized andaVerted.  
In principle, this method dates the time when the meteorite  
129 
129 
began to retain Xe 
from the decay of I1. 
But the various  
iodine-bearing sites in t1e meteorite differ greatly in their  
retentivity, the more labile ones retaining less Xe1 2 9 to begin  
with and being most vulnerable to losses if subsequent reheating  
events. Manuel'et al. (1968) have used data on low-retentivity  
sites to estimate cooling rates of chondrite parent-bodies.  
The results, 5 to 90 C/Myr, are reasonably consistent with metallb­
graphically determined cooling rates, 2 fo 10°C/Myr (Wood, 1967b).  
However, for determining the chronology of'the early  
solar 'system, data for high-retentivity rates are most pertinent.  
Podosek (1970) has measured (or reinterpreted) such data on .17  
meteorites. A variety of chondrite classes and petrologic types  
were represented: C(2,4); E(4,5); H(5); L(4,6); LL(3,6); as well  
as aubrites, a nakhlite 
and a silicate inclusion from a hexa­
129 
hedrite. Most of these meteorites began to retain'Xe 
within 
6 to 8 Myr of each other. Errors were often on the order of 
1 Myr or less, and thus at least some of these differences seem 
to be'real.  
It is difficult to make generalizations, however, because  
only a few members of each class have been measured thus far.  
A safe conclusion is that the parent bodies of many meteorite  
classes cooled to *enon-retention temperatures (1000-15000 K?)  
within 6-8 Myr of each other. Since cooling rates must-have  
varied with size of the body, the small spread in cooling times  
implies an even smaller spread in formation times: 
a few million  
years or less.

Actually, the time scale may have been considerably shorter  
still. 
Hanks and Anderson .(1969) have shown that the existence of  
3.6 AE old rocks on the Earth implies core formation at the very  
beginning of the Earth's history, in order to allow time for removal  
of the energy released. This in turn requires a high initial tem­
perature and hence a short accretion time: 
0.5 Myr or less.  
Though this time scale does not necessarily apply to the formation  
of asteroids and planetesimals, it does strengthen the case for  
rapid evolution of the inner solar system.  
Podosek and Hohenberg (1970) noted that three primitive  
chondrites: 
Renazzo (C2), Chainpur (LL3), and Manych (L3) did  
not give precise isochrons. They suggest that some of the con­
stituents of these meteorites have retained the I-Xe record of  
an earlier stage, but there are other alternatives. At least  
one of these meteorites has been severely reheated by shock  
(Wood, 1967b). 
This might have redistributed I and Xe so as  
to smear out any initial correlations  
The I-Xe method has not yet been able to establish the  
relative age of chondrules and matrix. The matrix of Chainpur  
appears to be 7.4 Myr older than the chondrules; but data on  
Renazzo suggest an age difference of 16 Myr in the reverse  
direction. In view of-the ambiguities surrounding these two  
meteorites, the question must be regarded as open.  
Aluminum-26. -
This nuclide (t1 
= 0.74 Myr) would be  
produced in fairly high abundance in nucleosynthetic processes,  
and'has therefore been proposed as a heat source for the melting  
of asteroids (Urey, 1955; Fish et al., 1960). 
A slight  
(0.4 to 0.6%) enrichment of Mg 6 in Al-rich meteorite phases was

----- Page 51 (native) -----
-
49­
26  
tentatively attributed by Clarke et al (1970) to Al, 
but a  
later study by Schramm et al. (1970) showed no perceptible  
enrichment to a 2a upper limit of 50.05%. All meteorites in this  
study were highly evolved, i.e. achondrites or Type 6 chondrites.  
This suggests that no detectable amounts of Al 
were present  
when the feldspar in these meteorites ceased exchanging Mg with  
other silicate phases, but does not preclude the possibility  
that significant amounts of Al26 were present several million  
3ears earlier.  
Superheavy Elements. - Xenon from chondrites is enriched  
in the heavier isotopes (Xe 31-Xe1 3 6 ) in proportions suggestive  
of heavy-element fission (see Rowe, 1968, for'data and references  
to earlier work). 
Yet the isotopic ratios do'not correspond to  
the fission spectrum of any known nuclide, and the amounts are  
far 'larger than expected from spontaneous fission of 4.51 AE  
238 
244 
U 
or 8'2 Myr Pu  
The abundance of this fission component parallels that  
of the most volatile elements: 
Pb, Bi, Tl, In, Hg, Xe, etc.,  
being highest in the most primitive chondrites. Anders and  
Heymann (1969) therefore suggested that the progenitor of the  
fission component was 6 superheavy element with atomic number  
Z 112 to 119, because these elements ('congeners of the Hg-Fr  
sequence)-are the only volatile ones between Z = 88 and > 130. 
Indeed, an "island of stability" centered on Z = 114, A = 298 
has beeh predicted from nuclear systematics. (See Seaborg, 1968,  
for a general review of superheavy elements, and Dakbwski, 1969,  
and Rao, 1970, for a further discussion of the meteorite problem).

Nucleosynthesis. - The presence in meteorites of extinct  
radionuclides shows that the last nucleosynthetic event which con­
tributed matter to the solar system occurred no more than a few  
hundred Myr before the formation of the solar system. The simple  
picture that all solar-system matter was synthesized in a single  
event was abandoned long ago. 
Almost certainly several successive  
stages were involved; and there have been many attempts to deter­
mine the number, duration, and relative importance of such stages.  
from,the abundances of radioactive nuclides. Early models  
generally assumed "continuous" nucleosynthesis over a long period  
of time (10-20 AE), at a constant or slowly declining rate  
(Fow-ler and Hoyle, 1960; Kohman, 1961). 
More recent efforts  
favor "prompt" synthesis of the major part of the elements at an  
early stage (Dicke, 1969; Unsbld, 1969), followed by continuous  
synthesis and a "last-minute" event just before the formation  
of the solar system. Hohenberg (1969) has estimated that the  
three stages contributed 81-89, 0-8, and 11-13% of the total  
L-process material ever produced. Prompt synthesis began 8.0  
to 8.8 AE ago, while last-minute synthesis took place 176 to  
129  
179 Myr before the onset of Xe 
retention in chondrites.  
Schramm and Wasserburg (1970) have shown, however, that these  
estimates are still model-dependent to a considerable extent.  
The mean age of the elements might indeed be close to Hohenberg's  
estimate of 8 AE, but the time-dependence of the nucleosynthesis  
function is not well-determined, and thus total times as high as

----- Page 53 (native) -----

51 -­
200 AE cannot be excluded. The interval between cessation of  
nucleosynthesis and onset of Xe-retention is better defined, and  
probably lies between 75 and 250 Myr.  
SUMMARY  
Most of the chemical differences among chondrites, involving  
some 55 elements, can be explained by a small number of fractionatioi  
processes in a cooling solar nebula.  
A. 
Ordinary Chondrites (2 to 4 a.u.).  
1. An early condensate, containing about 1/3 of the  
refractory elements (Ca, Al, Ti, U, Th, lanthanides, Pt metals,  
etc.), was lost at ml3000 K.  
2. 
After condensation of the remaining material to grains  
- 
of 10-5-10
6 cm, up to 50% of the nickel-iron was lost. 
The  
fractionation seems to have taken place below 1050 0 K, perhaps  
around 700 0 K, and may have been based upon the ferromagnetic  
properties-of-the metal grains.  
3. 
When the Fe2 + content of the silicates had risen to  
-20% by equilibration with the nebular gas, perhaps 75% of the  
condensate was'remelted to millimeter-sized droplets by local  
heating events (electric discharges), on a time scale of seconds  
to minutes. Volatiles were lost from the remelted material.  
4. The unremelted, fine-grained material continued to take  
up volatiles from the nebula (Pb, Bi, Tl, In, etc.) and accreted  
together with the remelted material. Accretion took place in a

1000 interval centered on 510_60K, at a pressure of 10- 4 ±2 atm.  
5160 K 
tapesr 
f1  
B. Enstatite Chondrites (2 to 4 a.u., perhaps inner fringe  
of asteroid belt).  
1. As above, but loss approached- 50%.  
2., 3. As above, but in a more reducing gas phase (C/O L  
0.9?). 
No fully satisfactory explanation for the more reducing  
gas composition is available. A gas-dust fractionation is a  
possibility.  
4. As above. The total pressure may have been higher.  
5. As above, but temperature and cooling rate are less well­
determined.  
C. Carbonaceous Chondrites [outer fringe of asteroid belt,  
or original source region of comets (_5 to -40 a.u.?)].  
1., 2. These processes seem to have been largely-inoperative  
in the source region of the carbonaceous chondrites. 
Only a slight  
metal-silicate fractionation (10%) is evident among members of  
this group.  
3. There is no evidence for remelting in Cl's ( 10% is  
possible, though). 
C2's to C4's show an increasing degree of  
remelting ( 40% to. _70%).  
4. Accretion seems to have taken place from -4500K to  
._3000K. Hydrated silicates, magnetite, and organic compounds are  
present in meteorites that accreted below 400 0K (Cl's, C2's, some  
C3's). 
Thepressure may have been slightly lower than that in

the region of ordinary chondrites, but probably not less, than  
- 6 
.I0
atm.  
5. Reheating was much less severe than for ordinary  
chondrites, especially in the case of Cl's and C2's.  
D. Inner Planets (0.4 to 1.5 a.u.).  
1. Uncertain, and possibly small. Earth and Moon may be  
slightly (!50%) enriched in refractories.  
2. Uncertain, and possibly small. Earth and Venus may be  
slightly (-10% to -30%) enriched in Fe. Extreme values of  
Fe/Si in Mer.cury and Moon may be due to special factors: 
early  
condensation of Fe at 0.4 a.u. and preferential accretion;  
fractionation of metal between planet and satellite.  
3. Remelting may have affected the major'part of planetary  
matter. The depletion of alkalis in the Earth and Moon suggests  
contents of -85% and -95% remelted, alkali-free material.  
4. Abundance pattern of volatiles in Earth is similar to  
that in ordinary chondrites. This is consistent with accretion  
either at a constant temperature near 500 0K, or at falling  
temperatures; the last few percent of the accreted material being  
carbonaceous-chondrite-like. 
The 100-fold greater depletion of  
the Moon implies either formation at higher temperatures (600­
6500 K) or a much smaller content of the volatile-rich, carbonaceous­
chondrite-like component.  
The principal conclusion of this paper is that substantial  
chemical fractionations took place in the inner solar system.

These processes were independent of each other, and thus the  
known meteorite types represent only a limited sampling of the  
possible range of planetary materials. At least seven degrees  
of freedom are available for the composition of planetary matter:  
depletion (or enrichment)of refractories and metal; condensation  
temperatures and oxidation states of remelted and unremelted  
material, and proportions of remelted and unremelted material.-

c The symbols H, L, and LL refer to total iron content, and stand for "high", "low", and  
"low-low", respectively. We shall find it convenient to use the collective symbol "0"

Figure Captions  
Figure 1. Condensatiov sequence of a gas of cosmic composition 
(Larimer, 1967; Anders, 1968, with minor revisions). 
Slow­
cooling sequence assumes diffusional equilibrium between ­
grain surfaces and interiors, with formation of solid solutions, 
while fast-cooling sequence corresponds to deposition of pure 
elements and compounds, without interdiffusion. Shaded areas 
represent condensation or chemical transformation of major 
constituents. The formation range of hydrated silicates is 
poorly known. 
Figure 2. Volatile elements are underabundant in C2 and C3  
chondrites relative to Cl's, by nearly constant factors.  
Even for the strongly depleted elements C to Kr, relative  
abundances stand in approximately the same ratio, 1:0.6:0.3.  
Dashed line: 
mean abundances in ordinary chondrites. (Data  
from Larimer and Anders, 1967; Anders, 1968, with minor  
revisions.)  
Figure 3. Gas chromatogram of hydrocarbons in the range C15 to  
C16 (unpublished work by M. H. Studier and R. Hayatsu).  
Synthetic Product: 
from CO and D2 by a Fischer-Tropsch reaction;  
Nonesuch Shale: 
terrestrial oil shale, about 1.1 AE old (hydro­
carbon fraction courtesy W. G. Meinschein); Murray Meteorite:  
C2 chondrite. 
Only 6 of the -104 isomeric hydrocarbons with 16  
C atoms are present in appreciable abundance; 5 of these (under­
lined) are common to all three samples. 
Identifications were  
confirmed by mass spectrometry.
