Abstract
India has been underrepresented in genome-wide surveys of human variation. We analyze 25 
diverse groups to provide strong evidence for two ancient populations, genetically divergent, that 
are ancestral to most Indians today. One, the “Ancestral North Indians” (ANI), is genetically close 
to Middle Easterners, Central Asians, and Europeans, while the other, the “Ancestral South 
Indians” (ASI), is as distinct from ANI and East Asians as they are from each other. By 
introducing methods that can estimate ancestry without accurate ancestral populations, we show 
that ANI ancestry ranges from 39-71% in India, and is higher in traditionally upper caste and 
Indo-European speakers. Groups with only ASI ancestry may no longer exist in mainland India. 
However, the Andamanese are an ASI-related group without ANI ancestry, showing that the 
peopling of the islands must have occurred before ANI-ASI gene flow on the mainland. Allele 
frequency differences between groups in India are larger than in Europe, reflecting strong founder 
effects whose signatures have been maintained for thousands of years due to endogamy. We 
therefore predict that there will be an excess of recessive diseases in India, different in each group, 
which should be possible to screen and map genetically.
The first systematic surveys of human variation in India focused on anthropometric traits, 
and found that India is structured along lines of ethnicity as well as geography1, a result that 
has since been confirmed by blood group, protein polymorphism2,3 and genetic analysis4. 
Genetic studies have further documented differences in relatedness to West 
Eurasians5,6,7,8, while mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) studies have shown that India harbors

deep rooted lineages that share no common ancestry with groups outside of South Asia for 
tens of thousands of years9. The most comprehensive survey of genetic variation in India to 
date analyzed 405 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 55 groups and identified 
distinct clusters correlated to language and geography10, while another study analyzed 
1,200 polymorphisms in 15 Indian American groups11. However, neither study analyzed 
enough data to more finely discern patterns of genetic variation.
We genotyped 132 Indian samples from 25 groups. To survey a wide range of ancestries, we 
sampled 15 states and 6 language families (including 2 language families from the Andaman 
Islands12) (Table 1 and Figure 1). To compare traditionally “upper” and “lower” castes after 
controlling for geography, we focused on castes from two states: Uttar Pradesh and Andhra 
Pradesh. We genotyped all samples on an Affymetrix 6.0 array, yielding data for 560,123 
autosomal SNPs after filtering (Methods). Allele frequency differentiation between groups 
was estimated with high accuracy (FST had an average standard error of ±0.0011; Tables Sl 
and S2). For some analyses, we also merged our data with HapMap13 and the Human 
Genome Diversity Panel (HGDP)14,15 (Methods).
We analyzed these data to address five questions. Does India harbor more substructure than 
Europe? Has endogamy been long-standing in Indian groups? Do nearly all Indians descend 
from a mixture of populations? Is the ancestry of tribal groups systematically different from 
castes? What is the origin of the indigenous Andaman Islanders?
Extensive population structure in India
We applied principal components analysis (PCA)16,17 to identify outlier groups (Figure 
S1). The first PC shows that the Siddi have African ancestry, consistent with their origin 
involving the Arab slave trade18. The second shows that the Nyshi and Ao Naga cluster 
with the Chinese (CHB), consistent with them speaking Tibeto-Burman languages. The third 
and fourth show that the Great Andamanese are dispersed, suggesting gene flow from the 
mainland in the last few generations19, but that the Onge cluster tightly, making them more 
useful for studying the relationship of the indigenous Andamanese to groups worldwide 
(Note S1). The Chenchu are a sixth outlier because of their high minimum FST of 0.052 
from all other groups (Table S3).
The average pairwise FST of the remaining 19 groups is 0.0109. This is much larger than the 
0.0033 in a recent study of 23 European groups20, although a strict comparison is difficult, 
since European studies have focused on cosmopolitan samples20,21, which could 
underestimate differentiation relative to our village-centered sampling. We considered the 
possibility that the high FST could be an artifact due to marriage between close relatives, 
which is known to be common in southern India22 and can exaggerate measurements of 
frequency differentiation. However, when we recalculated FST correcting for 
consanguinity23 (Appendix), the average differentiation decreased only marginally to 
0.0100. We also determined that the high FST was not due to our strategy of sampling 
diverse groups. Restricting to the 9 pairs of groups that were from the same state and 
traditional caste level, the average inbreeding-corrected FST was 0.0069; much higher than 
the analogous 0.0018 in Europe when comparing within regions (Table S3).

We propose that the high FST among Indian groups could be explained if many groups were 
founded by a few individuals, followed by limited gene flow8,24. This hypothesis predicts 
that within groups, pairs of individuals will tend to have substantial stretches of the genome 
where they share at least one allele at each SNP. We find signals of excess allele sharing in 
many groups (Figure S2), which as expected tend to occur in the groups that have the 
highest FST’s from all others (P=0.002 for a correlation). To estimate the age of founder 
events, we measured the genetic distance scale over which allele sharing decays, a procedure 
that we verified by simulation (Figure S3). Six Indo-European and Dravidian speaking 
groups have evidence of founder events dating to more than 30 generations ago (Figure S2), 
including the Vysya at more than 100 generations ago. Strong endogamy must have applied 
since then (average gene flow less than 1 in 30 per generation) to prevent the genetic 
signatures of founder events from being erased by gene flow. Some historians have argued 
that “caste” in modern India is an “invention” of colonialism25 in the sense that it became 
more rigid under colonial rule26. However, our results suggest that many current 
distinctions among groups are ancient and that strong endogamy must have shaped marriage 
patterns in India for thousands of years24,27.
Medical implications
The high frequency differentiation among Indian groups is medically significant as it shows 
that “population stratification” (systematic ancestry differences between cases and controls 
that can lead to false-positive disease associations) may be a confounder in gene mapping 
studies. This is superficially at odds with a recent report that in Indian Americans, allele 
frequency differentiation is lower than among Europeans11. A potential explanation for the 
discrepancy is that the previous study pooled samples by state of origin, which can mask 
substructure. For example, when we performed PCA on an independent set of 85 Gujarati 
Americans28, we found that they separate into two distinct clusters with high differentiation 
(FST = 0.005) (Figure S4). Similarly, pairs of Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh groups in 
our data (excluding the outlying Chenchu) have an average FST of 0.0107, but their 
differentiation decreases to 0.0033 when we first pool by state. It was recently suggested 
that to correct for stratification in India, it may be adequate to adjust for membership in five 
broad genetic clusters10. However, our results show that many Indian groups have a degree 
of allele frequency differentiation from their neighbors that is at least as large as that 
between northern and southern Europeans, which is known to be sufficient to cause false 
positives associations if uncorrected29.
The widespread history of founder events in India is also medically significant because it 
predicts a high rate of recessive disease. In Finland, there is a high rate of recessive diseases 
that has been shown to be due to a founder event, and that has resulted in a minimum FST of 
0.005 with other European groups20. Our data show that many Indian groups have a 
minimum FST with all other groups at least as large (Table 1). Haldane wrote 45 years ago 
that “if inter-caste marriages in India become common, various… recessive characters will 
become rarer”30. However, it has not been generally appreciated that this applies to groups 
throughout India, and not only to groups in the south where consanguinity is common22. 
We hypothesize that founder effects are responsible for an even higher burden of recessive 
diseases in India than consanguinity. To test this hypothesis, we used our data to estimate

the probability that two alleles from a group share a common ancestor more recently than 
that group’s divergence from other Indians, and compared this to the probability that an 
individual’s two alleles share an ancestor in the last few generations due to consanguinity23. 
Nine of the 15 Indian groups for which we could make this assessment had a higher 
probability of recessive disease due to founder events than to consanguinity, including all 
the Indo-European speaking groups (Table 2). It is important to systematically survey Indian 
groups to identify those with the strongest founder effects, and to prioritize them for studies 
to identify recessive diseases and map genes.
An additional reason why some diseases are expected to occur at elevated frequencies in 
India is shared descent from a common Indian ancestral population9,10. An example is a 25 
base pair deletion in MYBPC3 that increases heart failure risk by about 7-fold, and occurs at 
around 4% throughout India but is nearly absent elsewhere31. It has recently been shown 
that power to discover disease risk variants can be increased by modeling Indian genetic 
variation using a reference panel of European and Chinese chromosomes32. However, the 
example of MYBPC3 shows that this is an imperfect solution, since clinically significant 
alleles that are rare outside of India cannot be imputed by studying non-Indian genetic 
variation. It is important to specifically characterize Indian variation to permit full powered 
gene mapping in India, instead of relying on catalogs of variation compiled in distantly 
related groups.
Population mixture in Indian history
To better understand the genetic ancestry that is only found in India, we carried out a PCA 
of Europeans (CEU) and Chinese (CHB) along with 22 Indian groups (Figure 3). The first 
PC distinguishes CEU from CHB, and the second reflects ancestry that is unique to India31. 
The most remarkable feature of the PCA is a gradient of proximity to West Eurasians 
(Figure S5) (an analogous PCA in Europeans did not produce a gradient of proximity to 
India; Figure S6). We call this the “Indian Cline”, and hypothesize that it reflects the fact 
that different Indian groups have inherited different proportions of ancestry from “Ancestral 
North Indians” (ANI) related to West Eurasians, and “Ancestral South Indians” (ASI). To 
model ANI-ASI mixture, we selected a subset of 18 groups that formed tight clusters along 
the Indian Cline, and included the Pathan and Sindhi from Pakistan14 since they were 
consistent with the Indian Cline in the PCA but showed greater proximity to West Eurasians 
(Note S2), providing additional information about ANI-ASI mixture.
To test whether any of the 18 Indian Cline groups is consistent with all ANI or all ASI 
ancestry, we applied a novel 3 Population Test (Methods). If group X is related to groups Y 
and W by a simple tree (through a history of divergence without subsequent mixture) then if 
we define the SNP allele frequencies as pX, pY, and pZ, the quantity (pX-pY)(pX-pW) 
averaged over SNPs, should be proportional to the variance in allele frequency since group 
X split from Y and Z and thus should be positive. However, this quantity can be negative if 
X descends from a mixture event (Note S3 and Appendix). We applied this test to each of 
the 18 Indian Cline groups in turn using CEU=Y and Santhal=W, and obtained significantly 
negative scores for 16 groups (Table 2) as assessed by a jackknife analysis33 (Methods). 
These results do not mean that the Indian groups descend from mixtures of European and

Austro-Asiatic speakers, but only that they derive from at least two different groups that are 
(distantly) related to CEU and Santhal.
We verified the evidence of mixture by carrying out a 4 Population Test34. For any four 
groups there are 3 possible simple trees. If ((A,B),(C,D)) is correct, the allele frequency 
differences between A and B should be uncorrelated with those between C and D, which we 
can assess by averaging the quantity (pA-pB)(pC-pD) across SNPs (Appendix) and testing for 
consistency with 0 (Methods). No Indian Cline group could be related simply to CEU, Onge 
and West Africans (YRI) after testing all trees (Table S4).
Relationship of Indians to non-Indians
We developed a model to study the historical relationship of Indian groups to those 
worldwide, based on the hypothesis that most groups can be approximated as a mixture of 
two ancestral populations followed by group-specific drift. To fit the model to the data, we 
computed the squared allele frequency difference between all pairs of groups, and chose 
parameters by minimizing the difference between observation and expectation (Note S4). 
The idea of fitting allele frequency differentiation to historical models was first explored by 
Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards35 and here we extend it to trees with mixture. This approach 
contrasts with the STRUCTURE algorithm, which fits data without a tree36, or a tree in 
which many groups split simultaneously from an ancestral population followed by 
mixture37. While STRUCTURE is accurate for estimating individual mixture proportions in 
recently mixed groups, it is not clear whether its estimates of ancient mixture are biased 
because it does not model hierarchical relationships among groups, leading to inaccurate 
modeling frequencies in ancestral populations. By contrast, we use a more realistic tree 
model, and provide a test of fit.
Applying our model-fitting procedure, we find that the tree (YRI,(CEU,ANI),(ASI, Onge))) 
provides an excellent fit to the data from Indian groups. In particular, when the Pathan, 
Vaish, Meghawal and Bhil are modeled as mixtures of ANI and ASI (Figure 4), the 
observed allele frequency differentiation statistics are all consistent with the theoretical 
expectation within three standard deviations (Note S4).
Two features of the inferred history are of special interest. First, the ANI and CEU form a 
clade, and further analysis shows that the Adygei, a Caucasian group, are an outgroup (Note 
S4). Many Indian and European groups speak Indo-European languages, while the Adygei 
speak a Northwest Caucasian language. It is tempting to hypothesize that the population 
ancestral to ANI and CEU spoke “Proto-Indo-European”, which has been reconstructed as 
ancestral to both Sanskrit and European languages38, although we cannot be certain without 
a date for ANI-ASI mixture.
Second, our analysis shows that the Onge form a clade with the ASI (Note S4), which we 
verified by running the 4 Population Test on ((YRI,Papuan)(Dai,X)), and finding that it is 
consistent when X=Onge (Z=1.7) but inconsistent for all Indian Cline groups (Z≪-9) (Table 
S4). Previous mtDNA analyses suggested that the Onge do not share any maternal ancestry 
with groups outside India within the last ~48,000 years19,39. While they do share ancestry 
with some rare haplogroups in some Indian tribal populations within the last ~24,000 years

39,40, this is consistent with our inferred Onge-ASI clade, as long as the gene flow predated 
the ASI-ANI mixture that later occurred on the mainland.
We caution that “models” in population genetics should be treated with caution. While they 
provide an important framework for testing historical hypotheses, they are 
oversimplifications. For example, the true ancestral populations of India were probably not 
homogeneous as we assume in our model but instead were likely to have been formed by 
clusters of related groups that mixed at different times. However, modeling them as 
homogeneous fits the data and appears to capture meaningful features of history.
Estimates of mixture proportions in India
Estimating the proportions of ANI and ASI ancestry in India is challenging, since we are 
unaware of any published methods that produce unbiased estimates of mixture proportion in 
the absence of accurate ancestral groups. We developed three methods for estimating 
ancestry, which we verified were accurate even in the face of SNP ascertainment bias and 
some inaccuracies in our phylogenetic model (Note S5), and which we found provided 
consistent estimates (Table S5). The 18 Indian Cline groups all have between 39% and 77% 
ANI ancestry based on f3 Ancestry Estimates (Methods), which we quote because it has the 
smallest standard errors (Table 2). ANI ancestry is significantly higher in Indo-European 
than Dravidian speakers (P=0.013 by a 1-sided test)5,6,7,8,41, suggesting that the ancestral 
ASI may have spoken a Dravidian language before mixing with the ANI42. We also find 
significantly more ANI ancestry in traditionally upper than lower or middle caste groups 
(P=0.0025)5,6,7,8,41, and find that traditional caste level is significantly correlated to ANI 
ancestry even after controlling for language (P=0.0048), suggesting a relationship between 
the history of caste formation in India and ANI-ASI mixture.
We compared our autosomal estimates of ANI ancestry to Y chromosome and mtDNA 
haplogroup frequencies. Y chromosome analysis has shown that traditionally upper caste 
and Indo-European speaking groups have elevated frequencies of alleles that are also 
common in West Eurasians5,6. However, mtDNA analysis shows elevated frequencies of 
haplogroups common in West Eurasians only in northwest India7,8,43. Comparing the 
autosomal estimates of ANI ancestry to the frequencies of haplogroups characteristic of 
West Eurasians, we find a significant correlation on the Y chromosome (P=0.04) and a more 
marginal correlation in mtDNA (P=0.08) (Table S6 and Figure S7). The stronger gradient in 
males, replicating previous reports, could reflect either male gene flow from groups with 
more ANI relatedness into ones with less, or female gene flow in the reverse direction. 
However, extensive female gene flow in India would be expected to homogenize ANI 
ancestry on the autosomes just as in mtDNA, which we do not observe. Supporting the view 
of little female ANI ancestry in India, Kivisild et al.44 reported that mtDNA ‘haplogroup U’ 
splits into two deep clades. ‘U2i’ accounts for 77% of copies in India but ~0% in Europe, 
and ‘U2e’ accounts for 0% of all copies in India but ~10% in Europe. The split is ~50,000 
years old, indicating low female gene flow between Europe and India since that time.

Discussion
We have documented a high level of population substructure in India, and have shown that 
the model of mixture between two ancestral populations ASI and ANI provides an excellent 
description of genetic variation in many Indian groups. A priority for future work should be 
to estimate a date for the mixture, which may be possible by studying the length of stretches 
of ANI ancestry in Indian samples45,46, and will shed light on the process leading to the 
present structure of Indian groups. A second priority should be to discern the details of the 
history of the ANI and ASI before they mixed, including the date of their separation and 
their history of expansion and contraction; this may be possible by analyzing allele 
frequency spectrum47 and linkage disequilibrium data45,48,49. Our findings finally have 
medical implications. By showing that a large proportion of Indian groups descend from 
strong founder events, these results highlight the importance of identifying recessive 
diseases in these groups and mapping causal genes.
Methods Summary
Blood samples were collected with informed consent from volunteers. We designate groups 
by their anthropological name as well as their geographic location, since it has been shown 
that both are required to specify an effectively endogamous group in India1. All DNA 
samples were genotyped on Affymetrix 6.0 arrays. We restricted most analyses to samples 
that appeared to be unrelated, and to 560,123 autosomal SNPs for which there was good 
genotyping completeness and for which there were no signs of problematic genotyping. For 
some analyses we also intersected our data with Illumina 650Y genotyping of the Human 
Genome Diversity Panel14 and HapMap13,28, which produced a merged data set of 
119,744 autosomal SNPs14. We carried out PCA using the EIGENSOFT software17, 
assessed allele frequency differentiation among groups using FST, assessed inbreeding in 
each group using Wright’s Fixation Index F23, and computed standard errors using a Block 
Jackknife33. To detect the signature of founder events in linkage disequilibrium data, we 
studied all possible pairs of samples for each group, and recorded whether they share 0, 1 or 
2 alleles at each SNP (at SNPs where both individuals were heterozygous, we recorded 1 
allele to be shared to account for the ambiguity in the haplotype phase). Long stretches of 
allele sharing can reflect regions that are shared identical by descent from a common 
founder, and by measuring the exponential decay of allele sharing with distance, we inferred 
the age of the founder event (Figure S3). To test for a history of mixture, we applied 3 and 4 
Population Tests (Note S3). To infer the proportion of ancestry in each Indian Cline group 
in the absence of accurate ancestral populations, we used f3 Ancestry Estimation (Note S5).

Figure 2. 
Linkage disequilibrium based evidence for founder events in India. For each pair of samples, 
we calculate the autocorrelation of the number of shared alleles as a function of distance, 
recognizing that SNP genotypes should differ by at most one allele in regions of identity by 
descent. To correct for background allele sharing, we subtract the same quantity comparing 
across groups. Allele sharing in the Vysya decreases with an exponential decay of 0.461 cM 
as shown here, suggesting a founder event roughly 100/(2*0.461) = 108 generations ago. 
We present similar analyses for all Indian groups in Figure S2.

Principal components analysis (PCA) of 22 groups from the Indian subcontinent. Analysis 
of these groups along with Europeans (CEU) and Chinese (CHB) reveals a gradient of 
relatedness to CEU that runs through the majority of Indo-European and Dravidian groups, 
with the Kashmiri Pandit most related to CEU. Both the Austro-Asiatic speaking groups 
(Kharia and Santhal) and the tribal Sahariya are off-cline, while the two Tibeto-Burman 
speaking groups cluster with CHB. (Data from the outlying Siddi, Onge and Great 
Andamanese are not shown.)

Figure 4. 
A model relating the history of Indian and non-Indian groups. Modeling the Pathan, Vaish, 
Meghawal and Bhil as mixtures of ANI and ASI, and relating them to non-Indians by the 
phylogenetic tree (YRI,(CEU,ANI),(ASI, Onge))), provides an excellent fit to the data. 
While the model is precise about tree topology and ordering of splits, it provides no 
information about population size changes or the timings of events. We estimate genetic 
drift on each lineage in the sense of variance in allele frequencies, which we rescale to be 
comparable to FST (standard errors are typically ±0.001 but are not shown).

*Estimates of genetic drift (the variance in allele frequencies on any lineage) are based on a model in which each group is a simple mixture of ANI and ASI, followed by subsequent genetic drift specific to 
that group (corrected for inbreeding). To fit the model, we use the algorithm described in Note S4, and fit f2, f3 and f4 statistics that are calculated in a way that is unbiased by inbreeding (Appendix).
†Wright’s fixation index F is estimated as the excess rate at which the two copies of a chromosome within an individual from a group are identical by state, compared within across individuals from that 
group (Appendix). We set negative values to 0; standard errors are typically around 0.003. Because of the small sample sizes, these estimates are heavily influenced by the samples that happen to have been 
included in our analysis, and thus should be considered approximate.
††To estimate the proportion of recessive disease cases that are due to founder events, we consider the two alleles that a single individual carries at any locus. With probability F given by Wright’s Fixation 
Index, they coalesce in the last few generations due to consanguinity, and with probability (1-F)D, they coalescence more recently than ANI-ASI mixture due to founder events specific to that group. The 
fraction of recessive diseases due to founder events can thus be estimated as D(1-F)/(F+D(1-F)).
