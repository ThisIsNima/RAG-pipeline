I Abstract
Tight control of cell-cell communication is essential for the generation
of a normally patterned embryo. A critical mediator of key cell-cell signaling events
during embryogenesis is the highly conserved Wnt family of secreted proteins. Recent
biochemical and genetic analyses have greatly enriched our understanding of how
Wnts signal, and the list of canonical Wnt signaling components has exploded. The
data reveal that multiple extracellular, cytoplasmic, and nuclear regulators intricately
modulate Wnt signaling levels. In addition, receptor-ligand speciﬁcity and feedback
loops help to determine Wnt signaling outputs. Wnts are required for adult tissue
maintenance, and perturbations in Wnt signaling promote both human degenerative
diseases and cancer. The next few years are likely to see novel therapeutic reagents
aimed at controlling Wnt signaling in order to alleviate these conditions.

INTRODUCTION
The ﬁeld of developmental biology is rich with a history of observations predict-
ing the existence of signaling molecules that control key events in embryogenesis
(Gilbert 1991). Over the past 20 to 30 years, several families of signaling molecules
such as the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), the Hedgehogs, the ﬁbroblast
growth factors (FGFs), and the Wnts have been identiﬁed, and their signaling
mechanisms have been elucidated. These signaling pathways are also often in-
volved in disease, in particular cancer, reinforcing the concept that cancer is a
form of development gone awry.
The Wnt family of signaling proteins participates in multiple developmental
events during embryogenesis and has also been implicated in adult tissue home-
ostasis. Wnt signals are pleiotropic, with effects that include mitogenic stimulation,
cell fate speciﬁcation, and differentiation. This review summarizes our current un-
derstanding of Wnt signaling in the context of the many developmental roles of
this pathway. As the volume of Wnt literature is increasing rapidly, a few aspects of
current interest have been selected here, mainly focused on Wnt signaling through
its receptors (Frizzleds) to β-catenin, which is often called the canonical path-
way. Much work has been done recently on noncanonical pathways, which do not
involve β-catenin or Wnt ligands. That topic is not covered here, but we direct
readers to some recent reviews (Strutt 2003, Veeman et al. 2003). A continuing
update on Wnt signaling, including ﬁgures and gene tables, can be found on the
Wnt homepage http://www.stanford.edu/∼rnusse/wntwindow.html.
WNT SIGNALING: AN OVERVIEW
A simple outline of the current model of Wnt signal transduction is presented
in Figure 1. Wnt proteins releasedfrom or presented on the surface of signaling
cells act on target cells by binding to the Frizzled (Fz)/low density lipoprotein
(LDL) receptor-related protein (LRP) complex at the cell surface. These recep-
tors transduce a signal to several intracellular proteins that include Dishevelled
(Dsh), glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3), Axin, Adenomatous Polyposis Coli
(APC), and the transcriptional regulator, β-catenin (Figure 1). Cytoplasmic β-
catenin levels are normally kept low through continuous proteasome-mediated
degradation, which is controlled by a complex containing GSK-3/APC/Axin.
When cells receive Wnt signals, the degradation pathway is inhibited, and conse-
quently β-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Nuclear β-catenin
interacts with transcription factors such as lymphoid enhancer-binding factor
1/Tcell-speciﬁc transcription factor (LEF/TCF) to affect transcription. A large
number of Wnt targets have been identiﬁed that include members of the Wnt
signal transduction pathway itself, which provide feedback control during Wnt
signaling.

Figure 1
The canonical Wnt signaling pathway. In cells not exposed to a Wnt signal
(left panel), β-catenin is degraded through interactions with Axin, APC, and the protein
kinase GSK-3. Wnt proteins (right panel) bind to the Frizzled/LRP receptor complex
at the cell surface. These receptors transduce a signal to Dishevelled (Dsh) and to
Axin, which may directly interact (dashed lines). As a consequence, the degradation
of β-catenin is inhibited, and this protein accumulates in the cytoplasm and nucleus.
β-catenin then interacts with TCF to control transcription. Negative regulators are
outlined in black. Positively acting components are outlined in color.
WNT PROTEINS ARE LIPID MODIFIED
Wnt proteins are deﬁned by sequence rather than by functional properties. They
contain a signal sequence followed by a highly conserved distribution of cysteines.
Although Wnt proteins are secreted, difﬁculties in solubilizing active Wnt mole-
cules had hindered attempts to purify the Wnts and precluded a thorough biochem-
ical characterization of this growth factor family. The insoluble nature of Wnts has
now been explained by the discovery that these proteins are palmitoylated and are

more hydrophobic than initially predicted from the primary amino acid sequence
(Willert et al. 2003). The palmitoylation is found on a conserved cysteine, sug-
gesting that all Wnts carry this modiﬁcation. Mutant analysis has demonstrated
that this cysteine is essential for function, and treating Wnt with the enzyme acyl
protein thioesterase results in a form that is no longer hydrophobic or active, pro-
viding further evidence that the palmitate is critical for signaling (Willert et al.
2003).
The enzymes that add the palmitate to Wnts are likely to be encoded by
the porcupine (por) gene in Drosophila (Kadowaki et al. 1996), called mom-1
in Caenorhabditis elegans (Rocheleau et al. 1997). Phenotypic similarities be-
tween wnt and por/mom-1 suggest that Porcupine and MOM-1 are enzymes ded-
icated to Wnt signaling (Kadowaki et al. 1996). These genes are required in Wnt-
producing cells rather than in cells receiving the Wnt signal (Figure 2). Hofmann
(2000) noticed sequence similarity between Porcupine and membrane-bound acyl-
transferases, enzymes that are present in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) mem-
brane and acylate a variety of substrates. Therefore, it is possible that por en-
codes an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of palmitate onto Wnt. Consistent
with this idea, Wingless, like Wnt3a, is also hydrophobic (Zhai et al. 2004). Wing-
less can associate with membranes, but both its hydrophobicity and membrane
localization are lost when O-acyltransferase activity is inhibited biochemically
or when Porcupine is eliminated genetically. These data support the hypothesis
that Porcupine is a key regulator of both Wnt lipidation and membrane target-
ing. Interestingly, Hedgehog proteins also carry an N-terminal palmitate that is
essential for signaling. The addition of this palmitate is thought to be catalyzed
by Skinny-hedgehog which, like Porcupine, resembles acyl-tranferases (Chamoun
et al. 2001).

Figure 2
Wnt pathway molecules that facilitate secretion or presentation of Wnt pro-
teins or that modulate Wnt signaling levels. Porcupine (Por) is an ER protein required
in Wnt-producing cells, and it may attach a palmitate to Wnt. In C. elegans, the MOM-3
gene product (not yet identiﬁed molecularly) may assist in the production or release
of active Wnt. In vertebrates, Wnt proteins are inhibited by direct binding to either se-
creted frizzled-related protein (SFRP) or Wnt inhibitory factor (WIF). SFRP is similar
in sequence to the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of Frizzled, one of the Wnt receptors.
The Wnt inhibitors Dickkopf (Dkk) and Wise bind to the Wnt coreceptors Arrow and
LRP. Dkk also interacts with Kremen to down-regulate LRP/Arrow from the cell sur-
face. In Drosophila, Wnt can bind to the tyrosine kinase receptor Derailed [related
to tyrosine kinases (RYK) in mammals]. This receptor has a domain similar to WIF.
Heparin-sulfated forms of proteoglycans (HSPG) are also involved in Wnt reception
or transport. Boca/Mesd is speciﬁcally required for the transport of Arrow/LRP in the
ER. A novel Frizzled ligand, Norrin, has also been identiﬁed. Similar to Wnt, Norrin
bound to LRP and Frizzled can stimulate the canonical signaling pathway. Negative
regulators are outlined in black. Positively acting components are outlined in color.

Although palmitoylation is integral to Wnt signaling, its precise function is not
known. Overexpression of Wingless in Drosophila can partially circumvent the
need for por function (Noordermeer et al. 1995) and, similarly, Wnt mutant gene
constructs lacking the palmitoylation site can produce an attenuated signal when
overexpressed in cells (Willert et al. 2003). One explanation for these observations

is that the lipid moiety targets Wnts to membranes but its absence can be overcome
by high protein concentrations.
TRANSPORT OF WNT PROTEINS BETWEEN CELLS
The detection of Wnt proteins in many tissues has been problematic owing to lack
of suitable antibody reagents, but antibody staining of Wingless has demonstrated
signiﬁcant spread of the protein in Drosophila imaginal discs (Cadigan et al. 1998,
Strigini & Cohen 2000). These data have indicated that the Wnts, such as Wingless
in Drosophila, function as concentration-dependent long-range morphogenetic
signals that can act on distant neighbors (Cadigan et al. 1998, Strigini & Cohen
2000, Zecca et al. 1996). This raises the questions of whether palmitoylated Wnt
molecules are actively transported, how Wnts are released from cells, and how
Wnts move over long distances. Are Wnts always tethered to membranes, even
when shuttled between cells? Alternatively, are there carrier molecules that bind
to the palmitate? Vesicle-based transport outside of cells has been proposed to
exist in Drosophila wing imaginal discs. The vesicles, termed argosomes, might
carry Wg protein as cargo (Greco et al. 2001). Wnts may also be transported by
cytonemes, long thin ﬁlopodial processes that might carry Wnts and other growth
factors away from signaling cells (Ramirez-Weber & Kornberg 1999). There is no
evidence for speciﬁc exporters of Wnt molecules, although mom-3, identiﬁed in
C. elegans, is required in Wnt-producing cells (Figure 2) (Rocheleau et al. 1997).
This gene (also called mig-14) remains to be characterized molecularly.
Once Wnt proteins are secreted, a number of binding partners can modulate
their activity. Emerging evidence suggests a role for HSPGs in the transport or
stabilization of Wnt (Figure 2). In Drosophila, absence of Dally, an HSPG (Lin
& Perrimon 1999, Tsuda et al. 1999), and mutations in genes encoding enzymes
that modify HSPG (Baeg et al. 2001, Lin & Perrimon 2000) generate phenotypes
similartowinglessmutants.HSPGshavebeenpostulatedtofunctionascoreceptors
on target cells (Lin & Perrimon 1999), but cultured cells lacking Dally can respond
to Wg (Lum et al. 2003). HSPGs may therefore stabilize Wnt proteins or aid in its
presentation or movement between cells.
Secreted Wnts may also bind members of the SFRP family. These are secreted
proteins that resemble the ligand-binding domain of the Frizzled family of Wnt
receptors (Hoang et al. 1996, Rattner et al. 1997). Alternatively, Wnts may bind
WIF proteins, which are secreted molecules resembling the extracellular portion
of the Derailed/RYK class of transmembrane Wnt receptors (Hsieh et al. 1999a)
(Figure 2). In general, both SFRPs and WIFs are thought to function as extracellular
Wnt inhibitors (Baﬁco et al. 1999, Dennis et al. 1999, Hsieh et al. 1999a, Leyns
et al. 1997, Salic et al. 1997, Uren et al. 2000, Wang et al. 1997). However,
it has not been ruled out that these proteins, depending on expression levels or
cellular context, promote Wnt signaling by protecting Wnts from degradation or
by facilitating Wnt secretion or transport (Uren et al. 2000).

WNT SIGNALING IN DEVELOPMENT

WNT RECEPTORS AND THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH
EXTRACELLULAR INHIBITORS
Genetic and biochemical data have demonstrated that the Fz proteins are the
primary receptors for the Wnts (Bhanot et al. 1996) (Figure 2). Fzs are seven-
transmembrane receptors with a long N-terminal extension called a cysteine-rich
domain (CRD). Wnt proteins bind directly to the Fz CRD (Bhanot et al. 1996,
Dann et al. 2001, Hsieh et al. 1999b). In Drosophila and in cell culture, overex-
pression of the DFz2 receptor fails to activate Wnt signaling unless its cognate
ligand, Wingless, is present (Bhanot et al. 1996, Rulifson et al. 2000), suggesting
that Fz activation during canonical signaling is ligand dependent.
In addition to Wnt/Fz interactions, Wnt signaling also requires the presence
of a single-pass transmembrane molecule of the LRP family (Figure 2), identi-
ﬁed as the gene arrow in Drosophila (Wehrli et al. 2000) and as LRP5 or 6 in
vertebrates (Pinson et al. 2000, Tamai et al. 2000). The transport of LRP from
the ER to the cell surface requires a speciﬁc accessory molecule called Boca in
Drosophila and Mesd in mice (Culi & Mann 2003, Hsieh et al. 2003); mutations
in these genes produce phenotypes similar to loss of Arrow/LRP itself. It has
been proposed (Tamai et al. 2000) that Wnt molecules bind to LRP and Friz-
zled to form a receptor trimeric complex, although this has not been observed
for Wingless and Arrow in Drosophila (Wu & Nusse 2002). Nevertheless, the
importance of LRP is underscored by the ﬁnding that potent, extracellular in-
hibitors of Wnt signaling such as Wise (Itasaki et al. 2003) and Dickkopf (Glinka
et al. 1998) bind to LRP. The best characterized of the secreted Wnt-signaling in-
hibitorsaretheDickkopf(Dkk)proteins.Dkkshavenotbeenfoundininvertebrates,
but mice and humans have multiple Dkk genes (Krupnik et al. 1999, Monaghan
et al. 1999). Dkk1, in particular, is a potent Wnt-signaling inhibitor (Glinka et al.
1998). It binds to LRP with high afﬁnity (Baﬁco et al. 2001, Mao et al. 2001a,
Semenov et al. 2001) and to another class of transmembrane molecules, the Kre-
mens (Mao & Niehrs 2003, Mao et al. 2002). By forming a complex with LRP and
Kremen, Dkks promote the internalization of LRP, making it unavailable for Wnt
reception. The inhibitory function of Dkks depends on the presence of appropriate
Kremenproteins.Dkk2requiresKremen2inordertoinhibitWntsignalingandcan-
not function with Kremen1 to down-regulate the Wnt signal (Mao & Niehrs 2003).
Likewise, Kremen2 promotes the inhibitory activity of Dkk4 (Mao & Niehrs 2003).
In addition to binding the Wnts, Frizzled can also interact with another ligand.
Norrin, a protein with no discernable sequence similarity to the Wnts, binds with
high afﬁnity to the Frizzled-4 CRD (Xu et al. 2004). Together with LRP, Frizzled-
4 and Norrin can activate the canonical signaling pathway. The ability of Wnt
receptors to interact with multiple ligands underscores the pleiotropy of Frizzled
activity, and it is possible that there are yet additional ligands for this receptor
family.
Recent data show that Derailed, another Wnt receptor, is entirely distinct
from the Frizzleds (Figure 2). The Derailed receptor is a transmembrane tyrosine

kinase belonging to the RYK subfamily. Dwnt-5 is a regulator of axon guidance
in the Drosophila central nervous system (CNS), and embryos mutant for Dwnt-5
resemble those lacking Derailed, i.e., they display misrouting of neuronal projec-
tions across the midline (Yoshikawa et al. 2003). The Derailed extracellular region
contains a Wnt-interacting WIF domain (Hsieh et al. 1999a) that can bind to the
DWnt-5 protein (Yoshikawa et al. 2003), indicating that Derailed is a DWnt-5
receptor in the CNS. How Derailed signals are transduced is not clear; the De-
railed kinase domain appears dispensable for function (Yoshikawa et al. 2001),
and the possibility that signaling involves a coreceptor has not been excluded. In
vertebrates, both Wnt4 and Wnt5 have been implicated in axon guidance (Hall et al.
2000, Lyuksyutova et al. 2003). Wnt4 appears to signal in this context through a
Frizzled. Whether a RYK binds to Wnt5 is not known because the Wnt5a recep-
tor has not been identiﬁed. It will be interesting to determine whether Fz/LRP
and RYK receptors function in the same tissues and cellular processes and, if so,
whether Wnts simultaneously contact Fz/LRP and RYK-like kinases or stimulate
RYK and Fz/LRP receptors in parallel pathways.
HOW DO THE WNT RECEPTORS SIGNAL?
The observation that Fzs contain seven transmembrane regions has led to the
suggestion that Wnt binding might reconﬁgure the Fz transmembrane domains,
as occurs in other heptahelical receptors. How a reconﬁgured Fz receptor cou-
ples to downstream effectors is not understood. Dsh, a ubiquitously expressed
cytoplasmic protein (Lee et al. 1999, Yanagawa et al. 1995), functions cell au-
tonomously and genetically upstream of proteins such as β-catenin and GSK-3
(Noordermeer et al. 1994). It has been postulated that Dsh transduces the Wnt
signal into the cell through a direct binding between Dsh and Fz (Figures 2 and
3). Consistent with this idea, Dsh can interact with Fz directly (Chen et al. 2003,
Wong et al. 2003) through a C-terminal cytoplasmic Lys-Thr-X-X-X-Trp motif
in Fz that is required for Fz signaling (Umbhauer et al. 2000). Wnt signaling
also leads to differential phosphorylation of Dsh (Yanagawa et al. 1995), and
this process is mediated by several protein kinases, of which Par1 is the most
likely Wnt-regulated candidate (Sun et al. 2001). Some questions that remain are
whether Wnt binding to Fz regulates a direct Fz-Dsh interaction, how Dsh phos-
phorylation is controlled, and how phosphorylated Dsh functions in Wnt signal
transduction.
Similar to Fz, LRP may also interact with a cytoplasmic component of the
Wnt-signaling pathway. The cytoplasmic tail of LRP contains several Pro-Pro-
Pro-(SerTrp)Pro [PPP(S/T)P] motifs that can become phosphorylated following
Wnt stimulation (Tamai et al. 2004). Because LRP can interact with the cytosolic
protein Axin (Mao et al. 2001b, Tolwinski et al. 2003) (Figures 2 and 3), Wnts are
thought to induce the phosphorylation of LRP on a PPP(S/T)P motif, thus allowing
the docking of Axin to the LRP cytoplasmic tail.

Both Dsh and Axin contain a stretch of amino acids called the DIX domain.
DIX domains of Axin can homodimerize (Hedgepeth et al. 1999, Hsu et al. 1999,
Sakanaka & Williams 1999), and Dsh, and a Xenopus Axin, XARP, can het-
erodimerize through their DIX domains (Itoh et al. 2000). It is possible, therefore,
that Wnt binding of Fz and LRP promotes direct interaction between Axin and
Dsh through their DIX domains, reconﬁguring the protein complex that regulates
β-catenin levels in the cell (Figure 3).
Because most seven-transmembrane receptors signal through heterotrimeric
G proteins, it is reasonable to ask whether Fzs interact with G proteins as well.
Figure 3
Cytoplasmic components of the Wnt signaling pathway, In na¨ıve cells (left
panel), β-catenin forms a complex with Axin and APC. Axin acts as a scaffold for the
protein kinases CK1a and GSK-3, and the PP2A protein phosphatase. PP2A may act on
Axin as well as other on substrates in the Axin/APC complex. After phosphorylation
by GSK-3 and CK1a, β-catenin is degraded by ubiquitination involving interactions
with Slimb/β-TrCP. After binding of the Wnt ligand (right panel), the Fz and LRP
receptors recruit Dsh and Axin to the membrane where they may interact with each
other (dashed lines). Wnt signaling leads to inhibition of β-catenin degradation and
its accumulation. As a result, β-catenin is stabilized in the cytoplasm and is no longer
degraded. Negative regulators are outlined in black. Positively acting components are
outlined in color.

The most direct test of this hypothesis would be to add a known Wnt ligand
to cells expressing the cognate Frizzled receptor and to examine the immediate
consequences. Because Wnt proteins have been difﬁcult to isolate, experiments
along these lines have utilized chimeric Fz receptors that can be activated by a non-
Wnt ligand. Chimeric receptors consisting of the intracellular loops of rat Fz1 or rat
Fz2 and the transmembrane and exofacial regions of β-adrenergic receptor could
be activated by a β-adrenergic agonist and appear to signal through G proteins of
the Go, Gq, and Gt classes (X. Liu et al. 1999, Liu et al. 2001). Whether natural
Fz molecules can couple directly to heterotrimeric G proteins, however, remains
to be tested.
WNT SIGNALING WITHIN THE CYTOPLASM
A hallmark of Wnt pathway activation is the elevation of cytoplasmic β-catenin
protein levels. In the absence of Wnt signaling, β-catenin is phosphorylated by
the serine/threonine kinases, casein kinase Iα(CKIα) (Amit et al. 2002, Liu et al.
2002, Yanagawa et al. 2002) and GSK-3 (Yost et al. 1996). The interaction between
these kinases and β-catenin is facilitated by the scaffolding proteins, Axin and APC
(Hart et al. 1998, Kishida et al. 1998). Together, these proteins form a β-catenin
degradation complex that allows phosphorylated β-catenin to be recognized by
β-TrCP, targeted for ubiquitination, and degraded by the proteosome (Aberle et al.
1997, Latres et al. 1999, C. Liu et al. 1999) (Figure 3).
Activation of Wnt signaling inhibits β-catenin phosphorylation and hence its
degradation. The elevation of β-catenin levels leads to its nuclear accumulation
(Tolwinski & Wieschaus 2004, Miller & Moon 1997, Cox et al. 1999) and com-
plex formation with LEF/TCF transcription factors (van de Wetering et al. 1997,
Behrens et al. 1996, Molenaar et al. 1996). β-catenin mutant forms that lack the
phosphorylation sites required for its degradation are Wnt unresponsive and can
activate Wnt target genes constitutively (Munemitsu et al. 1996, Yost et al. 1996).
β-catenin, APC, and Axin mutations that promote β-catenin stabilization are found
in many different cancers, indicating that constitutive Wnt signaling is a common
feature in many neoplasms (reviewed in Giles et al. 2003).
Wnt signals might inﬂuence the cytoplasmic proteins that regulate β-catenin
stability through several mechanisms. Reception of a Wnt signal could trigger
the recruitment of Axin either to LRP or to Frizzled-bound Dsh, removing Axin
from the destruction complex to promote β-catenin stabilization (Cliffe et al.
2003, Tamai et al. 2004). Protein phosphatases also regulate β-catenin stability.
PP2A, for example, is required for the Wnt-dependent elevation of β-catenin levels
(J. Yang et al. 2003) and can bind Axin (Hsu et al. 1999), suggesting that it might
function to dephosphorylate GSK-3 substrates. How PP2A activity is regulated
by Wnt signals is not known. Finally, Dsh can interact with the destruction com-
plex through the GSK-3 binding protein, GBP/Frat (Jonkers et al. 1997, Salic
et al. 2000, Yost et al. 1998). Frat may promote the dissociation of GSK-3 from

the degradation complex and prevent the phosphorylation of β-catenin (Li et al.
1999), but how Wnt signals regulate this event is not clear. Current approaches to
elucidate the mechanisms of β-catenin regulation include attempts to determine
the structure of the degradation complex. There are now crystallographic struc-
tures of Axin contacting β-catenin (Xing et al. 2003) and Axin bound to APC
(Spink et al. 2000). However, the composition of the destruction complex and
the stoichiometry of the various components have not been fully resolved. Recent
data suggest that the number of Axin molecules in cells is much lower (5000-
fold) than other proteins in the complex (Lee et al. 2003). Axin, therefore, may
be a limiting component of the Wnt signaling cascade that, as a key scaffolding
molecule, may promote the rapid assembly and disassembly of Wnt pathway com-
ponents to regulate β-catenin stability in the cell. Given that Dsh, APC, GSK-3,
and β-catenin participate in other signaling events, low Axin levels may also help
to insulate the Wnt pathway from changes in the abundance of the other Wnt
signaling components when they participate in different signaling processes. Fur-
ther detailed stoichiometric analyses will provide deeper insights into the exact
nature of the β-catenin destruction complex and the mechanisms that regulate its
function.
SIGNALING IN THE NUCLEUS
The increased stability of β-catenin following Wnt signaling leads to the tran-
scriptional activation of target genes mediated by β-catenin interactions with the
TCF/LEF DNA-binding proteins (Figure 4) (van de Wetering et al. 1997, Behrens
et al. 1996, Molenaar et al. 1996). In the absence of the Wnt signal, TCF acts as a
repressor of Wnt/Wg target genes (Brannon et al. 1997) by forming a complex with
Groucho (Cavallo et al. 1998). The repressing effect of Groucho is mediated by
interactions with histone deacetylases (HDAC), which are thought to make DNA
refractive to transcriptional activation (Chen et al. 1999).
Once in the nucleus, β-catenin is thought to convert the TCF repressor complex
into a transcriptional activator complex. This may occur through displacement of
Groucho from TCF/LEF and recruitment of the histone acetylase CBP/p300 (cyclic
AMP response element-binding protein). CBP may bind to the β-catenin/TCF
complex as a coactivator (Hecht et al. 2000, Takemaru & Moon 2000), a hypothesis
that remains to be tested directly. Another activator, Brg-1, is a component of the
SWI/SNF (switching-defective and sucrose nonfermenting) chromatin remodeling
complex which, with CBP, may induce chromatin remodeling that favors target
gene transcription (Barker et al. 2001).
Further interactions between the TCF-β-catenin complex and chromatin could
be mediated by Legless (Bcl9) and Pygopos (Kramps et al. 2002, Parker et al. 2002,
Thompson et al. 2002). Mutations in either of these genes result in wingless-like
phenotypes in Drosophila, and both genes promote Wnt signaling in mammalian
cell culture experiments (Thompson et al. 2002).

Figure 4
Nuclear factors in Wnt signaling. The interaction between Groucho and TCF is
thought to down-regulate transcriptional activation (left panel). β-catenin is also negatively
regulated by binding to Chibby and Inhibitor of β-catenin and TCF (ICAT). TCF activity
in the nucleus can be modulated by phosphorylation by Nemo-like kinase (NLK), and in
C. elegans, a 14-3-3-like protein has been shown to facilitate nuclear export of TCF (thin
arrow). β-catenin interferes with the interaction between TCF and Groucho,, and together
with TCF, activates gene expression. β-catenin also binds to other components such as Legless
(Lgs), Pygopus (Pygo), CREB-binding protein (CBP), and Brg1. Negative regulators are
shown in black. Positively acting components are outlined in color.
Wnt signaling events in the nucleus are controlled by a number of protein
partners. For example, the protein Chibby is a nuclear antagonist that binds to
the C terminus of β-catenin (Takemaru et al. 2003). Another β-catenin-binding
protein, ICAT (Tago et al. 2000), not only blocks the binding of β-catenin to TCF
(Tago et al. 2000) but also leads to dissociation of complexes between β-catenin,
LEF,andCBP/p300(Daniels&Weis2002,Grahametal.2002).TCFisalsosubject

to regulation, as it can be phosphorylated by the mitogen-activated protein (MAP)
kinase–related protein kinase NLK/Nemo (Ishitani et al. 1999). NLK/Nemo itself
is activated by the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase, TAK1 (Ishitani
et al. 1999). The phosphorylation of TCF/LEF by activated Nemo is thought to
diminish the DNA-binding afﬁnity of the β-catenin/TCF/LEF complex, thereby
affecting transcriptional regulation of Wnt target genes (Ishitani et al. 1999, 2003).
Another consequence of TCF phosphorylation, at least in C. elegans, is export of
TCF from the nucleus (Meneghini et al. 1999), which is carried out by a 14-3-3
protein, Par5 (Lo et al. 2004). The ability of LEF/TCF to interact with DNA and
its other partners is therefore highly regulated and likely plays critical roles in the
modulation of Wnt target gene expression. Recently, it was shown that β-catenin
can interact with other binding partners in the nucleus, such as Pitx2. β-catenin
can convert Pitx2 from a transcriptional repressor into an activator (Kioussi et al.
2002), similar to its interaction with LEF1/TCF. The presence of additional β-
catenin-binding partners adds another layer of complexity to the regulation of
gene expression by nuclear β-catenin.
WNT TARGET GENES AND FEED BACK LOOPS
Mutant analysis of Wnt genes has shed light on the range of biological processes
that Wnts control. In particular, wingless in Drosophila is involved in numer-
ous developmental events that include embryonic and larval patterning (Cadigan
& Nusse 1997) and synaptic differentiation (Packard et al. 2002). In vertebrate
development, loss of a single Wnt gene can produce dramatic phenotypes that
range from embryonic lethality and CNS abnormalities to kidney and limb defects
(Table 1). These diverse phenotypes indicate that the Wnt pathway has distinct
transcriptional outputs. In many cases, the cell, rather than the signal, determines
the nature of the response, and up- or down-regulation of Wnt target genes is
cell-type speciﬁc. In other cases, however, the same target genes can be induced in
multiple cell and tissue types. Whether these are universal targets of Wnt signaling
remains to be shown.
Interestingly, there may be some themes in the types of target genes that are
induced by Wnts. Wnt signaling can promote the expression of Wnt pathway
components (Table 2). Whether these genes are direct Wnt targets is not known
in all cases, but this ﬁnding indicates that feedback control is a key feature of
Wnt signaling regulation. One class of targets that respond to Wnt signaling is
the Frizzleds (Cadigan et al. 1998, Muller et al. 1999, Sato et al. 1999, Willert
et al. 2002). Dfz2 in Drosophila is down-regulated by wg wherever Wg is active,
a process that may function to limit the levels of Wnt signaling within the Dfz2-
expressing cells. In addition, by reducing the levels of a high-afﬁnity receptor that
might otherwise limit Wg distribution, Wg may be allowed to diffuse over longer
distances (Cadigan et al. 1998). The levels of LRP and HSPG are also controlled
by Wg signaling, providing further ﬁne-tuning of Wg activity at the cell surface

(Baeg et al. 2001, Wehrli et al. 2000). Two cytoplasmic negative regulators are also
induced by Wnt signals. The naked cuticle (naked) gene is an EF-hand-containing
protein that can bind directly to Dsh and inhibit Wnt signaling in both Drosophila
(Rousset et al. 2001) and vertebrates (Wharton et al. 2001). The Axin2[gene is also
a direct Wnt target that is expressed in many sites where Wnt signaling is known
to occur (Aulehla et al. 2003, Jho et al. 2002). TCF and LEF are transcriptionally
responsive to Wnt signaling. In colorectal cancer cells, loss of APC up-regulates
LEF1, which may promote increased mis-regulation of Wnt target genes (Hov-
anes et al. 2001). APC mutations also up-regulate a splice-variant of TCF1 that
lacks an N-terminal β-catenin-binding site (Roose et al. 1999). This dominant-
negative TCF1 is thought to dampen Wnt signaling and reduce the severity of
perturbations that result from loss of β-catenin or APC. Therefore, although APC
mutations ultimately induce cancerous lesions in the colon, the induction of both
TCF1 and LEF1 expression reveals an exquisite ability of colon cells to modulate
Wnt signaling levels through feed-back regulation.
Cell proliferation is commonly regulated by Wnt signaling, and Wnt knockout
phenotypes can often be explained by a loss of cell proliferation. For example, limb
outgrowth fails in limb buds lacking Wnt5A (Yamaguchi et al. 1999), and expan-
sion of the CNS fails in Wnt1 mutants (Megason & McMahon 2002). A mitogenic
effect of wingless has also been reported for the Drosophila wing imaginal disc
(Giraldez & Cohen 2003). The loss of particular cells or tissues in Wnt mutants has
often been interpreted as stemming from perturbations in cell fate speciﬁcation,

but an alternative interpretation may be that in some cases, progenitor cells fail to
expand. A general function of Wnt signaling during development may therefore
be to regulate the cell proliferation by direct induction of cell cycle regulators.
Consistent with this, myc and cyclinD1 are direct Wnt signaling targets in colon
cancer cells (He et al. 1998, Shtutman et al. 1999, Tetsu & McCormick 1999).
A recent study in the skin (Jamora et al. 2003) has raised the intriguing possi-
bility that Wnt signaling might also generally regulate cell adhesion, although this
must be tested further. Formation of an epithelial bud during hair follicle develop-
ment requires the repression of E-cadherin transcription. Inputs from both Wnt,
which stabilizes β-catenin, and from the BMP inhibitor Noggin, which induces
Lef1 expression, directly repress the E-cadherin promoter. If the Wnts can regulate
cell-cell adhesion molecules at a transcriptional level, then Wnt signaling may in-
tegrate cell fate speciﬁcation and differentiation with cell behavior changes. It will
be interesting to determine whether Wnts regulate cadherin transcription in places
such as the teeth and mammary gland where morphogenetic movements similar
to those accompanying epithelial bud formation occur (van Genderen et al. 1994).
Several components of the Wnt pathway such as β-catenin and APC are also mul-
tifunctional, participating in cell-cell adhesion and cytoskeletal rearrangements
(reviewed in Bienz 2002, Gumbiner 2000). Therefore, the possibility that Wnt
signaling, through changes in β-catenin levels, directly impinges on cell adhesion
or cell behavior is tantalizing. and provides exciting avenues for further research.
For a discussion of current data that examines connections between cell adhesion
and Wnt signaling, we direct the reader to Nelson & Nusse (2004).
WNT PHENOTYPES: REDUNDANCY AND SPECIFICITY
A common approach to understanding the function of a particular gene in a tissue
or developmental process is to examine its knockout phenotype. In some cases, the
expression patterns and mutant phenotypes correlate closely and clearly demon-
strate the requirement for that particular Wnt in a speciﬁc developmental event.
Wnt3, for example, is expressed in the primitive streak in the early mouse em-
bryo, and Wnt3 mutants display gastrulation defects (P. Liu et al. 1999). There
are several cases, however, where mutant phenotypes were not fully revealed until
multiple Wnts were removed. One classic example is the Wnt1/Wnt3a double-
knockout, which demonstrates a requirement for Wnt signaling in a wider region
of the CNS than when only the Wnt1 or Wnt3a gene is eliminated (Table 1) (Ikeya
et al. 1997). This is also observed with downstream Wnt pathway components;
mutants of Lef1 and TCF1 exhibit defects similar to Wnt3a mutants but only when
both Lef1 and TCF1 are missing (Table 3). These examples illustrate that genetic
redundancy between Wnt signaling components is likely to greatly inﬂuence our
ability to discern and interpret Wnt mutant phenotypes.
The analysis of Fz mutants has largely failed to reveal speciﬁc Wnt/Fz pairs
that interact during development. An exception is Frizzled 4, which affects axonal

and Fz mutant phenotypes suggests that a single Frizzled might be activated by
multiple Wnts or that a given Wnt might bind multiple Frizzleds. In Drosophila,
Wg binds to both Fz and Dfz2 and a cuticle patterning defect is observed only when
both receptors are mutant (Bhanot et al. 1999, Chen & Struhl 1999, Kennerdell
& Carthew 1998, Rulifson et al. 2000). This is a relatively simple example where
signaling is mediated primarily by one Wnt and there is genetic redundancy be-
tween only two Fzs. In vertebrates, where Wnt and Fz expression patterns may be
more elaborate, and where Frizzled may even interact with other ligands such as

Norrin (Guo et al. 2004), the overlapping interactions and relationships between
Wnts, other Frizzled binding partners, and Fzs are likely to be far more complex.
In a given cell or tissue, only a subset of Wnts can stimulate the canonical
signalingpathway(forexamples,seeKispertetal.1998,Shimizuetal.1997,Torres
et al. 1996). These data likely reﬂect the ability of different Wnts to bind to the
particular receptors that exist on the surfaces of the responding cells. Studies that
measure Wnt-Fz binding afﬁnities are only just beginning (Hsieh et al. 1999b, Wu
& Nusse 2002). Not much is known about speciﬁcity between ligands and receptors
in vertebrates, but in Drosophila, the afﬁnity between Wingless and its receptors,
Fz and Dfz2, is high (Wu & Nusse 2002). As more binding studies are performed,
they will provide valuable tools for elucidating physiological interactions between
Wnts and Fzs.
WNT SIGNALING IN CANCER AND HUMAN DISEASE
Given the diverse phenotypes produced by Wnt knockouts in mice, it is not sur-
prising that loss of Wnts in humans has dire consequences as well. Recently,
Tetra-amelia, a rare human genetic disorder characterized by absence of limbs,
has been proposed to result from WNT3 loss-of- function mutations (Niemann
et al. 2004).
In adults, mis-regulation of the Wnt pathway also leads to a variety of abnor-
malities and degenerative diseases (Table 5). An LRP mutation has been identiﬁed
that causes increased bone density at deﬁned locations such as the jaw and palate
(Boyden et al. 2002, Little et al. 2002). The mutation is a single amino-acid sub-
stitution that makes LRP5 insensitive to Dkk-mediated Wnt pathway inhibition,
indicating that the phenotype results from overactive Wnt signaling in the bone
(Boyden et al. 2002). In a different study, mutations in LRP5 were correlated with

decreased bone mass (Gong et al. 2001). In this case, frame shift and missense
mutations were thought to create loss-of-function LRP5 mutations. These data in-
dicate that Wnt signaling mediated by LRP5 is required for maintenance of normal
bone density.
LRP5 mutations (Gong et al. 2001) can also be accompanied by vasculature
defects in the eye (osteoperosis-pseudoglioma syndrome or OPPG). In addition,
a hereditary disorder, called familial exudative vitreopathy (FEVR), is caused by
mutations in both LRP5 and the Fz4 receptor, which results in defective vasculoge-
nesis in the peripheral retina (Toomes et al. 2004, Robitaille et al. 2002). The Fz4
mutation is located in the seventh transmembrane domain, and the LRP5 mutations
all create prematurely terminated proteins, suggesting that FEVR results from loss
of Fz/LRP signaling. More recently, Norrin, a protein that bears no ressemblance
to Wnts, has been identiﬁed as the ligand for the Fz4/LRP receptor complex (Xu
et al. 2004). Signaling by functional Norrin/Fz/LRP complexes is therefore crucial
for proper vasculogenesis and its maintenance in at least some parts of the body.
Mutations in intracellular Wnt pathway components also produce dramatic
defects. A nonsense mutation in Axin2 has been shown to produce severe tooth
agenesis, or oligodontia, a condition in which multiple permanent teeth are missing
(Lammi et al. 2004).
Mutations that promote constitutive activation of the Wnt signaling pathway
lead to cancer. In addition to tooth defects, individuals with Axin2 mutations dis-
play a prediposition to colon cancer (Lammi et al. 2004). Moreover, the best-known
example of a disease involving a Wnt pathway mutation that produces tumors is
familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), an autosomal, dominantly inherited dis-
ease in which patients display hundreds or thousands of polyps in the colon and
rectum. This disease is caused most frequently by truncations in APC (Kinzler et al.
1991, Nishisho et al. 1991), which promote aberrant activation of the Wnt pathway
leading to adenomatous lesions owing to increased cell proliferation. Mutations
in β-catenin and APC have also been found in sporadic colon cancers and a large
variety of other tumor types (reviewed in Giles et al. 2003). Loss-of-function mu-
tations in Axin have been found in hepatocellular carcinomas (Satoh et al. 2000).
These examples demonstrate that the uncoupling of normal β-catenin regulation
from Wnt signaling control is an important event in the genesis of many cancers.
It has become increasingly common to view cancer as a stem cell disease (see
Taipale & Beachy 2001). In the colon, loss of TCF4 or Dkk overexpression pro-
motes loss of stem cells in the colon crypt, indicating that Wnt signaling is required
for maintenance of the stem cell compartment (Korinek et al. 1998, Kuhnert et al.
2004, Pinto et al. 2003). A more extensive discussion of Wnt signaling and colon
stem cell control is presented elsewhere in this volume (see Sancho et al. 2004.
Wnt signaling may therefore be a fundamental regulator of stem cell choices to
proliferate or self-renew. Consistent with this idea, Wnt3a promotes self-renewal
of hematopoietic stem cells in vitro (Willert et al. 2003). The use of soluble Wnts
to control the proliferation and/or maintenance of stem cells may offer powerful
therapeutic reagents for the in vitro manipulation of stem cells and their reintro-
duction into diseased tissues.

EVOLUTIONARY ORIGIN WNT SIGNALING
Is it possible to trace the evolutionary origins of Wnt signaling? With the comple-
tion of several animal genomes and partial sequence information on other organ-
isms, these questions can now be addressed in a systematic manner. The ﬁnished
genomes of some mammals and invertebrate organisms has led to catalogues of
19 Wnt genes in the human and the mouse, 7 in Drosophila, and 5 in C. elegans.
Between Drosophila and mammals, there is fairly extensive conservation of Wnt
genes, so that orthologs can readily be recognized. These orthologous relation-
ships suggest similar biological or biochemical activities, the orthologs Wnt1 and
wingless, for example, both regulate the expression of their target gene, engrailed
(Danielian & McMahon 1996). Between Drosophila and vertebrates, there is also
conservation of clusters of genes. This indicates that there was a common ancestral
cluster of Wnt genes containing WNT1, WNT6, and WNT10 that predated the last
common ancestor of arthropods and deuterostomes (Nusse 2001, Prud’homme
et al. 2002).
Members of the Cnidaria, which are primitive diploblasts, contain a bona ﬁde
Wnt and a complete set of Wnt pathway genes (Hobmayer et al. 2000). In another
member of the Cnidaria family, the Anemone Nematostella, a β-catenin homolog
has been shown to be involved in Axis speciﬁcation and the formation of endoderm
(Wikramanayake et al. 2003). Sponges have a Fz gene (Adell et al. 2003), providing
anotherstrikingexampleoftheconservationofWntsignalingpathwaycomponents
throughout evolution.
In yet other primitive organisms, components of the pathway are present, but
not necessarily regulated by a Wnt signal. Dictyostelium has a vestige of a Wnt
pathway, as a gene called aardvark is not only a β-catenin homolog (Grimson
et al. 2000) but is also regulated by GSK-3 phosphorylation (Grimson et al. 2000).
However, there is no evidence for Wnt-like genes in this organism, and although
several seven transmembrane molecules act as receptors for cyclic AMP and reg-
ulate GSK activity (Plyte et al. 1999), there is no signiﬁcant homology between
those receptors and the Frizzleds. There are clearly recognizable homologs of β-
catenin in plants (Amador et al. 2001). It is possible, therefore, that an ancient
β-catenin-based mechanism existed prior to the evolution of animals. By adding
Wnt and Frizzleds, β-catenin activity became subject to control from other cells,
a quintessential aspect of organized multicellular life.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
The past few years have been accompanied by an explosion of data that implicates
Wnt signaling in development and in adult tissue maintenance. Given the number
of Wnt genes and their widely ranging functions, a large fraction of developmental
decisions during the lifetime of an animal may be inﬂuenced by a Wnt signal. It is
not surprising that mis-regulation of such an important pathway leads to disease,
and the role of Wnt signaling in cancer is now well established. Whereas we have

WNT SIGNALING IN DEVELOPMENT

an increasingly detailed picture of Wnt signaling as a complex, tightly regulated
pathwaywithmanyfunctions,themechanismsofseveraloutstandingeventsduring
Wnt signal transduction still need to be resolved. These include understanding how
Wnts are secreted and presented to cells, how Wnt binding to the Fz/LRP complex
transduces a signal to Dsh, how proteins within the β-catenin degradation complex
are regulated, and how inputs from positive and negative regulators are integrated
within the nucleus to effect transcription. In addition, translating our knowledge of
Wnt signaling into some form of intervention for disease is a formidable but im-
portant challenge. Fortunately, powerful new experimental methods and reagents
for the study of Wnt signaling have recently become available. These include puri-
ﬁed Wnt ligands (Willert et al. 2003), small molecules that either activate (Meijer
et al. 2003) or inhibit Wnt signaling (Lepourcelet et al. 2004), and RNAi screens
for components of the Wnt signaling pathway (Boutros et al. 2004, Lum et al.
2003). The quest for additional tools to manipulate this pathway, to a large extent
driven by the potential use of these reagents in managing disease, will lead to
further insights into the complexity and intricacy of the Wnt signal transduction
cascade.
