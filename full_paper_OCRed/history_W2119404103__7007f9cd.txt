The Norway spruce genome sequence
and conifer genome evolution
Lists of authors and their affiliations appear at the end of the paper
Conifers have dominated forests for more than 200 million years and are of huge ecological and economic importance.
Here we present the draft assembly of the 20-gigabase genome of Norway spruce (Picea abies), the first available for any
gymnosperm. The number of well-supported genes (28,354) is similar to the .100 times smaller genome of Arabidopsis
thaliana, and there is no evidence of a recent whole-genome duplication in the gymnosperm lineage. Instead, the large
genome size seems to result from the slow and steady accumulation of a diverse set of long-terminal repeat transposable
elements, possibly owing to the lack of an efficient elimination mechanism. Comparative sequencing of Pinus sylvestris,
Abies sibirica, Juniperus communis, Taxus baccata and Gnetum gnemon reveals that the transposable element diversity
is shared among extant conifers. Expression of 24-nucleotide small RNAs, previously implicated in transposable element
silencing, is tissue-specific and much lower than in other plants. We further identify numerous long (.10,000 base
pairs) introns, gene-like fragments, uncharacterized long non-coding RNAs and short RNAs. This opens up new
genomic avenues for conifer forestry and breeding.
Gymnosperms are a group of land plants comprising the extant taxa,
cycads,Ginkgo, gnetophytes and conifers. Gymnospermsfirst appeared
morethan300 million years ago (Myrago)1, wellbefore theangiosperm
lineage separated from the stem group of extant gymnosperms2. The
major radiation of conifer families occurred 250–65Myr ago3, and
during their evolution the morphology of conifers has changed rela-
tively little. There are approximately 630 conifer species, representing
about 70 currently recognized genera, which dominate many terrestrial
ecosystems, especially in the Northern Hemisphere. Conifers also
dominated both before and after the major mass extinction events at
the end of the Permian and Cretaceous periods, around 250 and 65Myr
ago, respectively. Conifers are of immense ecological and economic
value; coniferous forests cover enormous areas in the Northern Hemi-
sphere, and conifers are keystone species in many other ecosystems.
Conifers contribute a large fraction of terrestrial photosynthesis and
biomass, and the cultural and economic values of conifers are also para-
mount; early civilizations used conifers for firewood, tools and artefacts
andtodayseveralnationaleconomiesdependoncommoditiesproduced
from conifers. However, despite their abundance and importance, our
understanding of conifer genomes is limited. Most conifers have 12
(2n5 24) chromosomes, probably reflecting the ancestral karyotype4,
which are typically of similar size, each being roughly comparable to the
sizeofthe humangenome,and containinghighproportionsofrepetitive
elements5,6. The gene space of conifer genomes has not been well char-
acterized, although several reports have suggested that gene families in
conifers may be larger than their angiosperm counterparts7 and that
conifer genomes contain numerous pseudogenes8.
Because their genomes are among the largest—typically 20–30
gigabases pairs (Gb)—of all organisms, genome-wide analyses of con-
ifers are particularly challenging. Thus, no full genome sequence of a
gymnosperm species is available at present, whereas 30 angiosperm
and more basal plant genomes have been sequenced. However, size is
not the only challenge to sequencing presented by conifer genomes.
Conifers are typically outbreeding, produce wind-dispersed pollen,
have very large effective population sizes, and their genomes are
highly heterozygous, although their nucleotide substitution rates are
lower than those of most angiosperms8,9, perhaps owing to long life-
span (decades to centuries). Furthermore, inbreeding depression
negates the production of inbred lines that could facilitate genome
assembly.
The availability of conifer genome sequences would enable com-
parative analyses of genome architecture and the evolution of key
traits for seed plants, including flower or fruit development and life
history (perennial versus annual), and help to determine how and why
conifer genomes became so large. To address these issues and aid
forest tree breeding, biodiversity and conservation studies by, for
example, enabling the genome-wide design of genetic markers, we
used data from massively parallel DNA sequencing to assemble a draft
of the 20-Gb nuclear genome of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.)
Karst), one of the most widespread, ecologically and economically
important plants in Europe. We analysed the protein-coding and
non-coding fractions of the genome and compared them to the
low-coverage draft genome assemblies of five other gymnosperms—
Scots pine (P. sylvestris), Siberian fir (A. sibirica), juniper (J. commu-
nis), yew (Taxus baccata) and Gnetum gnemon—to gain insight into
conifer genome evolution.
Sequencing and assembly
Wesequenceda43-year-oldroot-graftedcopyoftheP.abiescloneZ4006,
which originated from a tree in Ragunda, central Sweden, collected in
1959. Many copies of this clone are available in clone archives and seed
orchards, and it has been extensively used in Swedish breeding programs.
We estimated its genome size to be 19.6Gb (C520.0260.95pg
(mean6s.d.);SupplementaryInformation1.1),inaccordancewithprevi-
ous reports10.
De novo sequencing and assembly of large, repeat-containing, het-
erozygous genomes remains challenging. To assemble the P. abies
genome, we developed a hierarchical strategy combining fosmid
pools11 with both haploid and diploid whole genome shotgun
(WGS) data, and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data12–14 (Supplemen-
tary Information1.2–1.3).Theresultingassembly(P.abies1.0)included
4.3 Gb in .10-kilobase (kb) scaffolds (Table 1), and we estimated that
approximately 63% of protein-coding genes15 were fully covered
(.90% of their length), and 96% partially covered (.30% of their
length) within single scaffolds (Supplementary Information 1.4). By
mapping diploid reads to the P.abies 1.0 assembly, the single nucleotide

polymorphism (SNP) frequency was estimated to be 0.77% and the
short insertion/deletion (indel) frequency to be 0.05% (Supplemen-
tary Information 1.5).
The chloroplast genome (124 kb) revealed considerable structural
variation within the genus Picea (Supplementary Information 1.6).
The draft mitochondrial genome (.4 Mb) was among the largest
reported for plants and was rich in short open-reading frames (ORFs),
which appeared to be gene remnants derived from repeat-driven mito-
chondrial rearrangements16 (Supplementary Information 1.7).
Presence of long introns and gene-like fragments
We generated .1 billion RNA-Seq reads and used transcript assem-
blies of these in combination with public expressed sequence tags
(ESTs) and transcripts to perform ab initio prediction of protein-
coding genes, which identified a high confidence set of 28,354 loci
with .70% coverage by supporting evidence from the total set of
70,968 predicted loci. A notable characteristic of the predicted gene
structures was the presence of numerous long introns (Fig. 1b), with
mean intron length being higher than in most available plant gen-
omes, although similar to the repeat-rich genomes of Vitis vinifera
and Zea mays17,18. The longest intron in the high-confidence genes
was 68 kb (Supplementary Table 2.6), and 2,384 high-confidence
genes contained 2,880 longer than 5-kb introns (20 of which we con-
firmed by PCR amplification; Supplementary Information 2.14),
2,679 of which contained a repeat, suggesting that repeat insertions
account for intron expansion. By contrast, exon size was consistent
among the species considered (Supplementary Information 2.6.3).
Numerous genes (,30%) remained split across scaffolds owing to
assembly fragmentation, and as such, the longest introns were not
represented in the P.abies 1.0 assembly. Long introns (either indi-
vidual or cumulative intron length) did not influence expression levels
(Fig. 1c) and introns containing repeats have not contracted despite a
lack of recent repeat activity (see below).
Analysis of gene families in the high-confidence gene set and seven
sequenced plant genomes (five angiosperms: Arabidopsis thaliana,
Populus trichocarpa, Vitis vinifera, Oryza sativa and Zea mays, and
two basal plants: Selaginella moellendorffii and Physcomitrella patens)
identified 1,021 P. abies-specific gene families (Fig. 1a and Sup-
plementary Information 2.8). P. abies-specific families included
over-representation of Gene Ontology categories involved in DNA
repair and methylation of DNA and chromatin (Supplementary
Information 2.8). As for most draft genomes, these results probably
overestimate gene numbers19 and will be refined as we further
improve the genome assembly.
A common mechanism leading to genome size expansion is the
occurrence of a whole genome duplication (WGD) event. We calcu-
lated the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site
(Ks) of paralogues within the high-confidence genes but found no
evidence for any recent WGD; there was a clear, exponential decay
in the number of retained paralogues with increasing Ks values (Sup-
plementary Information 2.9 and Supplementary Fig. 2.6). However, a
population dynamics model that takes into account both small- and
large-scale modes of gene duplication20 suggested the presence of a
small peak (around Ks of 1.1), which, considering the slow substi-
tution rate of conifers, might represent the ancient WGD predating
the divergence of angiosperms and gymnosperms (350 Myr ago21).
Previous examinations of small genomic subsets indicated that
conifer genomes contain numerous pseudogenes5,6,22,23. The gene-like
fraction of the P.abies 1.0 assembly was identified by alignment of
RNA-Seq reads and de novo assembled transcripts (Supplementary
Information 2.10). Within this subset of the genome, loci with valid
spliced alignments of de novo assembled transcripts or the presence of
a high-confidence gene were also identified. The high-confidence
gene set represented 27 Mb of protein-coding sequence, whereas
72 Mb of regions were identified with a valid spliced alignment or a
high-confidence gene. In stark contrast, 524 Mb of gene-like regions
were identified by less stringent alignments. The presence of such a
large gene-like fraction lacking predicted gene structures supports the
presence of numerous pseudogenes.
Recent ENCODE publications24,25 characterized numerous long
non-coding RNA (lncRNA) loci in the human genome, but this class
of RNA remains largely uncharacterized in plants. Using short-read
de novo transcript assemblies, 13,031 spruce-specific and 9,686 con-
served intergenic lncRNAs were identified (Supplementary Informa-
tion 2.4.3). In common with the ENCODE results, P. abies lncRNA
loci contained fewer exons, were shorter (Fig. 1c), and had more
tissue-specific expression than protein-coding loci (Supplementary
Fig. 2.8).
There has been conflicting evidence about the presence of 24-
nucleotide short RNAs (sRNAs) in gymnosperms26–29, a class of
sRNA that silence transposable elements by the establishment of
DNA methylation30. Across 22 samples, we identified numerous
24-nucleotide sRNAs, but these were highly specific to reproductive
tissues, largely associated with repeats but present at substanti-
ally lower levels than in angiosperms (Fig. 1d and Supplementary
Fig. 2.10). By contrast, 21-nucleotide sRNAs were associated with
genes, repeats and promoters/untranslated regions (UTRs) (Fig. 1d).
De novo microRNA (miRNA) prediction identified 2,719 loci, includ-
ing 20 known miRNA families, with target sites predicted within
the high-confidence gene set for 1,378 of these (Supplementary
Information 2.13). Furthermore, 55 known miRNA families had .5
aligned sRNA reads and mature miRNAs, representing 49 known
families aligned to the genome (Supplementary Information 2.13).
Conifer genomes grew by insertion of LTR-RT elements
We constructed a manually curated library of 1,773 repetitive
sequences, approximately half of which could be assigned to known
transposable element repeat families (Supplementary Information
3.1–3.3). Long terminal repeat-retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) com-
prised the most abundant fraction of transposable elements, with
the Ty3/Gypsy superfamily being more abundant than the Ty1/
Copia superfamily (Fig. 2a and Table 1). We also identified and char-
acterized transposable elements using 454 reads from randomly
sheared genomic DNA in five other gymnosperms (P. sylvestris, A.
sibirica, J. communis, T. baccata and G. gnemon) and, in all six species,
LTR-RTs were the most abundant class (Fig. 2a, Supplementary
Information 4.1 and Supplementary Table 3.1).

To trace the history of transposable elements in vascular plants we
inferred phylogenies of a domain of the reverse transcriptase genes of
both Ty1/Copia and Ty3/Gypsy elements. The phylogenies revealed
several diverse and ancient transposable element subfamilies, present in
almost all of the examined conifer genera, whereas only a few subfamilies
were expanded in the angiosperm genomes(Fig. 2b,c and Supplementary
Information 3.11).Mostinternalcladeswithsignificant bootstrapsupport
were consistently species-specific, indicating that most expansions of
extant transposable element families occurred after divergence. Two
species-specific amplification bursts were evident: a Ty1/Copia family in
J. communis and a Ty3/Gypsy family in T. baccata. We used complete
LTR-RTs from P. abies and P. glauca to investigate further the timing of
conifer transposable element insertions31 (Supplementary Information
3.4–3.8). In contrast to a similar set of elements identified in Oryza sativa
and O. glaberrima (Fig. 2d), we detected no evidence of recent activity
(that is, less than 5Myr ago) in P. abies. Instead, insertions seem to have
occurred over several tens of millions of years (older insertions are more
likely to escape detection). Analysis of 68 orthologous transposable ele-
ment insertions in P. abies and P. glauca further supported this: 63 inser-
tions apparently predated divergence, and only five occurred after the
lineages separated 13–20Myr ago (Supplementary Information 3.9).
We clustered LTRs of complete elements to identify transpos-
able element families32. More than 86% of the elements remained as
singletons, indicating that LTR-RTs are quite divergent and that
there are several low-abundance families. We searched three LTR-
RT families for signatures of unequal intra-element recombination
events in scaffolds .50 kb and 20 complete fosmids33. For families
ALISEI, 3K05 and 4D08_5 we identified 21, 22 and 39 complete
elements, and four, five and no solo LTRs, respectively (Supplemen-
tary Information 3.10). Although this data set is limited, the analysis
suggested that LTR-RT-related sequences might be removed less fre-
quently by unequal recombination than in other plant genomes. The
ratio of solo-LTRs to complete elements in P. abies is ,1:9, whereas in
A. thaliana, rice and barley it is 1:1 (ref. 33), 0.6:1 (ref. 34) and 16:1 (for
the abundant BARE 1 element35), respectively. Taken together, these
findingsindicatedthattheextantsetoftransposableelementsinP.abies
accumulated slowly over tens or hundreds of millions years, mainly by
the insertion of LTR-RT elements with limited transposable element
removal.
An analysis of introns across taxa provided further insight into the
genome of the last common ancestor to the conifers. We identified
orthologues of normal sized (50–300 bp) and long (1–20 kb) introns in

spruce within draft genome assemblies of P. sylvestris and G. gnemon
(Supplementary Information 4.2). Introns identified as orthologous to
a long intron in P. abies were also atypically long (Fig. 3a, b), suggesting
that intron expansions started early in the history of conifers.
The evolution of important conifer traits
Two major differences between angiosperms and gymnosperms are
their contrasting reproductive development and the development
of water-conducting xylem cells. We therefore manually identified
P. abies loci homologous to genes known to be centrally involved in
these processes in angiosperms.
In angiosperms, homologues of the A. thaliana phosphatidyletha-
nolamine-binding protein (PEBP) FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) are
key activators of flowering. It has been suggested that gymnosperms
lack orthologues of FT genes, instead containing a group of FT/TFL1-
like genes that probably act as flowering repressors36,37. We identified
four putative FT/TFL1-like genes in the P.abies 1.0 genome that have
not been previously described and confirmed that the genome does
indeed lack FT-like genes (Supplementary Information 5.1).
MADS-box genes are involved in controlling most aspects of angio-
sperm development38. A total of 278 sequences with clear homology to
MADS boxes were identified in the P.abies 1.0 assembly (Supplemen-
tary Information 5.2), 41 of which had transcript support. Type I and
II MADS-box genes are distinguished in plants. Only 5% of the iden-
tified MADS boxes were of type I (Supplementary Fig. 5.2.), the lowest
percentage of potential type I genes recorded in any plant genome.
Type II MADS-box genes are subdivided into about a dozen ancient
clades. We observed remarkable expansions in the TM3-like (or
SOC1-like), STMADS11-like and TM8-like gene clades in P. abies.
Because members of these gene clades are involved in vegetative
development and phase changes such as the floral transition in
angiosperms39, we propose that the expansion of these gene clades
has contributed to the evolution of developmental phase changes in
gymnosperms.
The xylem tissue of most gymnosperms comprises a single water-
transporting cell type, tracheids. By contrast, the xylem tissue of angio-
sperm species contains fibres, originating from tracheids that have to a
large extent lost the capacity to conduct mass water flows, and vessels
thathavetakenoverthewater-transportfunctioninthestem.Formation
of vessels is controlled by the VASCULAR NAC DOMAIN (VND) gene
family, which has seven members in A. thaliana40. We detected two
VND genes in P. abies (Supplementary Information 5.3), suggesting that
co-option and expansion of the VND gene family in vessel formation
might have been important for angiosperm evolution.

A model for conifer genome evolution
We propose the following model of conifer genome evolution. After
the lineage that led to angiosperms had branched off and the most
recentcommonancestorof extantconifershad beenestablished, the 12
ancestral chromosomes expanded at a slow and steady rate due to the
activity of a diverse set of Gypsy and Copia LTR transposable elements
that are largely shared among extant conifers. The expansion started
early and, in contrast to angiosperms genomes in which this has been
counteracted by efficient recombination mechanisms33 resulting in
only smaller transposable element subsets remaining following recent
bursts of activity41,42, these elements have remained in the genome. We
propose that mechanisms for transposable element removal (for
example by unequal recombination) have been less active in conifers
than in most other organisms43, and our data suggest that the insertion
of transposable elements into genes gave rise to large introns, and
(combined with other mechanisms) abundant pseudogenes. Each
chromosome has grown to a similar size—perhaps limited by physical
constraints on, for instance, chromosomal replication—with genes
separated by large regions of transposable-element-rich, highly poly-
morphic non-protein-coding regions with low recombination fre-
quencies. The gradual increase in size, the lack of WGDs and a
predominately out-crossing mating system have probably also buf-
fered conifer genomes against chromosomal rearrangements (WGD
reduces sensitivity to aneuploidy), thereby maintaining synteny over
large phylogenetic distances44.
Some angiospems, such as cereals, also have large genomes but it
seems as if the ‘‘one way ticket towards genome obesity’’45 that is
barely recognizable in angiosperms prevails in conifers. The under-
lying mechanism remains unclear, but the low frequency of 24-
nucleotide sRNAs, their role in methylation of repeats and their
restriction to reproductive tissues may have influenced the process.
However, considering the effect of methylation patterns on recom-
bination rates46 and the fact that 24-nucleotide sRNAs trigger methy-
lation, such low recombination frequencies would more likely result
from hypermethylation47. A state of ‘genome paralysis’ could poten-
tially have been triggered once an obesity threshold was reached. In
the angiosperm lineage, the occurrence of a number of WGDs pro-
bably increased diversification potential, allowing morphological
innovation (for example, the origin of flowers and fruits) and faci-
litating speciation46,48,49. By contrast, the conserved genome structure
resulting from the paucity of genome rearrangements and lack of
WGDs in conifers probably limited the evolution of reproductive
barriers (resulting in relatively low rates of speciation), and may
explain the high degrees of conservation through time and low mor-
phological diversity. Nevertheless, these processes do not seem to
affect fitness as conifers dominate many ecosystems, probably because
they contain high degrees of standing genetic variation, allowing them
to occupy very wide ecological niches in climatic regions where other
plant species are less competitive. The future availability of additional
gymnosperm genome sequences will allow further exploration of the
unique processes that have driven their evolution and facilitate
improvement of this important species.
METHODS SUMMARY
We shotgun-sequenced 450 fosmid pools containing around 100–6,000 fosmids
per pool (Supplementary Table 1.4). Each fosmid pool was assembled and scaf-
folded individually. Fosmid pool scaffolds larger than 1 kb (,6.7 Gb in total) were
merged12 (Supplementary Information 1.3) with a 383 haploid WGS assembly
(,9.8 Gb in total, derived from ,600 ng of DNA extracted from a single mega-
gametophyte). We subsequently performed scaffolding13 using WGS libraries of
five different insert sizes (0.3, 0.65, 2.4, 4.4 and 10.4 kb) from diploid tissue. We
further increased assembly contiguity of protein-coding regions by scaffolding
using a set of ,38 million unassembled (after digital normalization) RNA-Seq
read-pairs generated from 22 samples (Supplementary Information 1.3).
Ab initio prediction of protein-coding genes was performed using ESTs from
numerous conifer species, our own short-read de novo transcript assemblies and
proteins from other plant species as supporting evidence (Supplementary
Information 2.6). Predicted loci were used to perform gene family analysis and
to examine the Ks substitution rates of paralogues to identify evidence for a recent
WGD event. De novo transcript assemblies were used to identify lncRNA, and
sRNA sequencing was performed and used for de novo miRNA prediction.
Repeated sequences were identified de novo using 454 reads longer than 700 bp
generated from randomly sheared genomic DNA. Candidates were characterized
using similarity searches at the nucleotide and amino acid level against public and
custom collections of plant transposable element sequences. Complete LTR-RTs
were identified using a combination of de novo searches and manual inspection.
WGS assemblies from shallow sequencing (3.8–12.53) of P. sylvestris, A. sibir-
ica, J. communis, T. baccata and G. gnemon were produced using the CLC Bio de
novo assembler.
