INTRODUCTION
Gram-negative bacteria characteristically are surrounded by
an outer membrane (OM). Analysis of prokaryote phylogeny
using signature sequences in proteins even led to the notion
that a major phylogenetic division exists between organisms
with double-membrane envelopes (diderms) and those with
only a simple cytoplasmic membrane (monoderms) (240). It is
likely that the most important function for the additional mem-
brane layer, the OM, in gram-negative bacteria is to serve as a
selective permeation barrier. My earlier review of this subject,
written with Martti Vaara, appeared in 1985 (464). It was an
opportune time for such a review because the fundamental
properties of the Escherichia coli porins and the speciﬁc mal-
todextrin channel, LamB, were characterized a few years ear-
lier (see, for example, references 388 and 460–462) and the
asymmetric structure of the OM bilayer, with lipopolysaccha-
rides (LPS) located exclusively in the outer leaﬂet (316), of-
fered an explanation for the unusually slow inﬂux of lipophilic
solutes. In the intervening 18 years, explosive progress has
occurred in the ﬁeld. Diffusion through the nonspeciﬁc porin
channels and the speciﬁc channels are now understood in mo-
lecular detail, thanks to the elucidation of the crystal structure
of these proteins. Channel proteins were identiﬁed in many
nonenteric bacteria as a result of the rapid growth of our
knowledge of the genome sequences, and in some cases this
has offered insights into the physiology of various organisms in
their native habitat. Studies of LPS not only showed us the
impressive diversity of LPS structures in the bacterial kingdom
but also led to the realization that the LPS structure may be
modiﬁed in response to the conditions prevailing in the envi-
ronment.
The present review attempts to summarize the development
in the ﬁeld since 1985. The major problem in presenting the
results has been the information explosion. For example, more
than 650 articles with the word “porin” in the title have been
published during this period. If the databases are searched with
“porin” or “lipopolysaccharide” as keywords, literally thou-
sands of references are retrieved. Therefore, I had to be se-
verely restrictive with citations in order to keep the review
within a reasonable (and perhaps useful) size. I tried to limit
the discussion strictly to selective permeability, eliminating
most papers dealing with the biosynthesis and assembly of the
OM or with the role of the OM in the interaction of bacteria
with the environment, including higher animals and plants. I
also apologize at the outset for the omission of many refer-
ences which were not cited because the main message could be
found in other articles or reviews or, probably most frequently,
because of my oversight.
PROTEIN CHANNELS
OMs, like other biological membranes, are fundamentally
built as a bilayer of lipids. As such, lipid bilayers show little
permeability for hydrophilic solutes, including most nutrients.
Therefore, they contain channel-forming proteins for the pur-
pose of allowing the inﬂux of nutrients and perhaps for the
extrusion of waste products. One such nonspeciﬁc channel-
forming protein, porin, was discovered in 1976 (438), and the
word “porin” was proposed speciﬁcally for this class of proteins
forming nonspeciﬁc diffusion channels. As predicted, porins
were found in every species of gram-negative bacteria investi-
gated and even in a group of “gram-positive” bacteria, the
Corynebacterium-Nocardia-Mycobacterium complex, which pro-
duces a lipid-rich, bilayer-like “cell wall” (see below). (Interest-
ingly, the Corynebacterium-Nocardia-Mycobacterium complex
appears to be related to gram-negative bacteria on the basis of
signature sequence analysis, since both of these groups have a
12-residue deletion in the S12 ribosomal protein, unlike ar-
chaebacteria and other gram-positive bacteria [240]).
At about the same time as bacterial porin was discovered,

porins in mitochondria were discovered (584); this was fol-
lowed a few years later by a study in my own laboratory using
different approaches (773). The mitochondrial porins (voltage-
dependent anion channels [VDAC]) are not discussed further,
except to note that the channels are apparently large (up to 3
nm in diameter), as expected, because mitochondria have no
need to exclude toxic molecules in the environment, and that
the overall structure is thought to be similar to the -barrel
structure (to be discussed below) of bacterial porins. Many
reviews of mitochondrial porins exist (see, for example, refer-
ences 65 and 397). Another eukaryotic organelle in which
porins were found is peroxisome (540–542).
The word “porin” has suffered from its popularity. As stated
above, it was deﬁned to mean only proteins that form nonspe-
ciﬁc channels. Workers often concocted fanciful names like
“maltoporin” for the LamB channel, which is speciﬁc, or
“phosphoporin” for the Escherichia coli PhoE porin, which
prefers anions in general and has no speciﬁcity for phosphate.
These abuses of the term cause confusion and misunderstand-
ing, and I present a plea, once again, to limit the word “porin”
to references to nonspeciﬁc channels only.
Classical Porins
Families of classical porins. The OM must allow transmem-
brane passage of nutrient molecules, which are usually small
and hydrophilic. At the time of the ﬁrst version of this review
(464), E. coli was known to produce three trimeric porins
(OmpF, OmpC, and PhoE). Since the studies of these porins
formed the basis of our current knowledge of many other
porins, they (and their homologs) are called “classical porins”
in the present review. They show general preferences for
charge and size of the solute, with OmpF and OmpC prefer-
ring cations slightly over anions and PhoE preferring anions
and with OmpF allowing the permeation of slightly larger
solutes than OmpC does. Furthermore, the diffusion rates of
sugars of various sizes led to the estimate that the OmpF porin
channel had a diameter of about 12 A˚. Since that time, a great
deal of progress has occurred in the ﬁeld, some of which is
described in minireviews (343, 453, 587, 598, 599).
X-ray crystallographic analysis showed that porins exist as
transmembrane -barrels (see below). However, crystal struc-
tures are available for only a few porins, and therefore it
becomes highly desirable to derive as much information from
primary sequence. Unfortunately, comparison of primary se-
quences of porins is extremely difﬁcult. This is because the
external loops between the transmembrane -strands undergo
very rapid mutational alterations as they interact with elements
of the external world, such as antibodies, components of the
innate immune system, bacteriocins, and phages. Because of
this, simple alignment programs such as BLAST are “fooled”
and create gaps at improper places. It is therefore important to
ﬁrst identify the transmembrane -strands and compare dif-
ferent sequences solely on the basis of the sequences of these
strands. However, none of the simple algorithms proposed for
the detection of transmembrane strands work in a satisfactory
manner, as mentioned by Ferenci (199). The proposal made by
Ferenci was to look at the alignment of related porin se-
quences and assume that the less variant regions correspond to
transmembrane strands. This works very nicely when many
sequences from isolates of the same species, for example, exist
(362, 482). However, in other cases one has to start from an
alignment of sequences of distantly related porins, and this
requires the prior identiﬁcation of transmembrane strands.
One method that seems to work reasonably well for the
detection of transmembrane strands is that of Jeanteur et al.
(303, 304), which uses the sum of the hydrophobicity and
hydrophobic moment of each 9- to 10-residue segments. Their
alignment, together with the addition of some newer sequences
aligned by myself, is shown in Fig. 1. In this way, we can see
that porins from -, -, and -protcobacteria are indeed re-
lated to each other, a conclusion that BLAST, for example,
completely fails to show. Figure 1 also shows some character-
istic features of porins from various groups of bacteria. (i)
Porins from -proteobacteria show strong similarity to each
other and are characterized by the presence of short (10-
residue) extensions at their N termini (Vibrio cholerae OmpU
is an exception). If the alignment presented is correct, porins
from the Vibrio-Photobacterium group are unusual in contain-
ing exceptionally long L3 loops. Enterobacterial porins contain
the characteristic PEFGGD signature sequence in L3, as noted
previously (303). (ii) Porins from -proteobacteria have se-
quences that are similar to each other but quite divergent from
those of the -proteobacteria. Although Fig. 1 shows only the
sequences of Neisseria meningitidis PorB and Bordetella pertus-
sis porin, several other sequences were aligned earlier (303,
304). (iii) Porins from -proteobacteria again seem to form a
group of their own.
Porins from the organisms in the ε-proteobacteria, which
forms a very deep branch almost reaching the bottom of the
whole Proteobacteria group, are indeed quite different in se-
quence, and I have not been able to align porins from Helico-
bacter pylori (60, 178, 196) or Campylobacter jejuni (78, 79, 362,
782) with the porin sequences shown in Fig. 1.
Functional assays. Nonspeciﬁc diffusion of hydrophilic sol-
utes across the OM usually occurs through porin channels, and
thus the activity of these channels in intact cells is most con-
veniently assayed by determining the ﬂux of hydrophilic solutes
or ions. For isolated porin proteins, reconstitution into planar
bilayer lipids allows the measurement of ﬂux of ions through
single channels. Although the single-channel conductance val-
ues have been used to calculate the sizes of the channel by
assuming that ions within the channel behave identically to
those in bulk solutions, this procedure often leads to mislead-
ing results (452, 453). A remarkable example is found in some
mutants of E. coli OmpF porin, where both crystallography and
the proteoliposome swelling assay (see below) showed enlarge-
ment of the channel whereas single-channel conductance
showed a signiﬁcant decrease (571). Another problem in the
use of single-channel conductance is that it is often a result of
insertion of a porin trimer, containing three open channels,
rather than that of a “single” channel. Thus, the data that E.
coli OmpF gave a single-channel conductance of about 2 nS in
1 M KCl led to the calculated pore diameter of 9 A˚ (52); this
was thought to validate the calculation because of the agree-
ment of calculated diameter with that found later by crystal-
lography. However, the conductance of 2 nS was actually the
result of insertion of three channels in a trimer, and the true
single-channel conductance of OmpF is around 0.7 nS, which
gives an unreasonable prediction for the pore diameter (452).

FIG. 1. Sequence alignment of porins from -, -, and -proteobacteria. The classiﬁcation of the source organisms into -, -, and -subdivisions is shown at the beginning. Transmembrane
-strands are indicated by highlighting, in red, the presence of hydrophobic amino acid residues at alternate positions. The PEFGGD motif of loop 3 in the Enterobacteriaceae and corresponding
sequences are colored in blue. The alignment of E. coli OmpF (ECOOMPF), E. coli OmpC (ECOOMPC), E. coli PhoE (ECOPHOE), Haemophilus inﬂuenzae Rd P2 porin (HINP2), Neisseria
meningitidis PorB (NMEPORB), Bordetella pertussis porin (BPEPOR), Comamonas acidovorans Omp32 (CACPOR), Rhodopseudomonas blastica porin (RBLPOR), and Rhodobacter capsulatus
porin (RCAPOR) is basically that of Jeanteur et al. (303, 304), with minor adjustments. The rest of the sequences (Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans porin [AFEPOR], Pasteurella multocida OmpH
[PMUOMPH], Serratia marcescens OmpF [SMAOMPF], Vibrio cholerae OmpU [VCHOMPU], Photobacterium profundus OmpL [PPROMPL], V. cholerae OmpT [VCHOMPT], and Brucella
abortus porin [BABPOR]) were aligned by me. The alignment relied mostly on the plot of (average hydrophobicity  average hydrophobic moment) as speciﬁed by Jeanteur et al. (303, 304)
and took into account the prediction of turns (485). The Gibbs motif sampling program (442) was also utilized (http://bayesweb.wadsworth.org/gibbs/gibbs.html), although this program predicted
only the -strands facing the lipid bilayer. When multiple sequences were available, deletions and insertions were assumed to have occurred in loops (199); this approach was useful in the analysis
of P. multocida OmpH (129, 390) and B. abortus porin (424, 482). The alignment of V. cholerae OmpU, V. cholerae OmpT, and P. profundum OmpL was difﬁcult but was helped by the comparison
among these three, as well as with Vibrio ﬁscheri OmpU and VCH1008 from the V. cholerae genome-sequencing project (both sequences retrieved from GenBank). No attempt was made to
align the variable-loop sequences carefully.

Single-channel conductance is a reasonable indicator of pore
size for large channels, but it must be used with the utmost
caution for small channels. This problem has also been dis-
cussed in a recent review (693). Nevertheless, the planar bi-
layer study is the only functional assay performed with many
porins; therefore, the single-channel conductance value for
OmpF, 0.7 nS, is used as the reference in the discussion of
many such porins (see “Other porins” below).
The bilayer domain of the OM is asymmetric, at least in
Enterobacteriaceae, with the outer and inner leaﬂets containing
nearly exclusively LPS and phospholipid molecules, respec-
tively (see “Lipid bilayer as a diffusion barrier” below). There-
fore, there is concern about the use of the phospholipid bi-
layer, or even nonphysiological barriers such as oxidized
cholesterol, for planar ﬁlm studies. In fact, some authors have
argued that porin channels behave quite differently when they
are in a natural, asymmetric bilayer of the OM (168, 169). In
this connection, it is important that an asymmetric planar bi-
layer, containing on one side a deep-rough LPS exclusively,
was used for experiments involving a trimeric porin of Para-
coccus denitriﬁcans (732). There was no difference in single-
channel conductance regardless of whether the bilayer was
asymmetric or symmetric (i.e., containing phospholipids in
both leaﬂets). However, the spontaneous insertion of porin
from the phospholipid side was accelerated more than an order
of magnitude if LPS was present on the other side, a result that
may have important implications for the mechanism of assem-
bly of OM proteins in intact cells. The voltage-gating behavior
was affected somewhat, in a way that was expected if the total
potential sensed by the porin molecules was the sum of exter-
nal voltage and the internal potential arising from the presence
of excess negative charges on the LPS-containing outer leaﬂet.
Another approach is the reconstitution of porins into mul-
tilayered proteoliposomes and the measurement of solute dif-
fusion rates that are reﬂected in the rates of osmotic swelling
of these vesicles in media containing the test solutes (460).
Comparison of diffusion rates of solutes of various sizes gave
remarkably reliable values of the channel size with respect to
the crystallographic structure (see below). However, because
swelling occurs in response to the movement of any solute,
including components of the buffer, extreme care is needed
when this method is used to study the diffusion of charged
solutes (461).
Finally, diffusion rates through porin channels can be mea-
sured in intact cells by coupling the inﬂux of hydrophilic solutes
with a “sink” process. A convenient assay is to examine the
inﬂux of cephalosporins by coupling it to their hydrolysis by
periplasmic -lactamase (462); cephalosporins are especially
useful because a diverse collection of cephalosporins has been
synthesized and because the hydrolysis can be monitored easily
by recording changes in the optical density at 260 nm.
Crystallographic structure of porins. Undoubtedly the most
important progress in the study of porins was the elucidation of
the three-dimensional structures of trimeric porins by electron
diffraction (297–300, 705) and X-ray crystallography. The latter
approach had its ﬁrst success with a Rhodobacter capsulatus
trimeric porin (714–718), an achievement that was quickly fol-
lowed by the elucidation of the structure of the E. coli OmpF
and PhoE porins (152). Important conclusions from these
studies include the following (there are recent minireviews on
the structure of porins [343, 598, 599]).
(i) As predicted from earlier studies, porin monomers were
shown to cross the lipid bilayer as a -barrel or a series of 16
-strands. The strands are tilted rather strongly (by 30 to 60°)
in relation to the barrel axis, as shown earlier by Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy (436), and this tilting in-
creases the diameter of the barrel. (For the concept of sheer
number, which is related to the degree of tilt, see reference
599.) The length of each transmembrane strand spans the
range from only 7 (in strand 5) to 16 (in strand 1) residues in
OmpF. Contact among the monomers is stabilized by hydro-
phobic and polar interactions, and loop 2 tends to bend over
the wall of the barrel of the neighboring subunit, playing a
signiﬁcant role in stabilization (Fig. 2A).
(ii) The external surface of the barrel is occupied by li-
pophilic side chains. One striking observation about the R.
capsulatus porin was the presence of many aromatic amino
acid residues at both the outer and inner interfaces between
the bilayer and the aqueous medium (714). The presence of
these “aromatic girdles” has since been observed in the struc-
FIG. 2. Structure of the OmpF porin of E. coli. (A) View of the trimer from the top, that is, in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the
membrane. Loop 2, colored blue, plays a role in interaction of the monomer with its neighboring unit. Loop 3, colored orange, narrows the channel.
(B) View of the monomeric unit from the side, roughly in the direction of the arrow in panel A. Loops 2 and 3 are colored as in panel A. (C) View
of the monomeric unit from the top, showing the “eyelet” or the constricted region of the channel. The eyelet is formed by Glu117 and Asp113
from the L3 loop, as well as four basic residues from the opposing barrel wall, Lys16, Arg42, Arg82, and Arg132, all shown as spheres. The diagrams
are based on PDB ﬁle 2OMF. This ﬁgure and Fig. 4 and 6 were drawn by using the program PyMol (Warren L. DeLano, DeLano Scientiﬁc LLC,

ture of E. coli OmpF and PhoE (152) and many other OM
proteins. They are now known to exist, to a somewhat lesser
extent, also in the structure of integral inner membrane pro-
teins (see also reference 755).
(iii) It was observed, just before the elucidation of the struc-
tures of OmpF and PhoE, that porin sequences almost invari-
ably end with a C-terminal phenylalanine (635). This feature
was conﬁrmed with practically all OM channel proteins, al-
though in rare cases the C-terminal residue is tryptophan. This
C-terminal residue is located at the OM/periplasm interface in
OmpF and PhoE (152), and its conservation is at least partially
explained by this location.
(iv) Transmembrane strands are connected by short “turns”
on the periplasmic side, but the “loops” that connect the
strands on the external sides are often long. With both R.
capsulatus porin and OmpF, loop 2 folds back outward and
contributes to the connection with the neighboring monomer.
Loop 3, connecting strand 5 with strand 6, is especially long (33
residues in OmpF) and folds into the barrel to produce the
narrowing of the channel (often called the “eyelet”) (Fig. 2B
and C). It was impossible to predict from simple folding pre-
diction algorithms that the eyelet region, which has the stron-
gest effects on the function of porin, is made in this manner,
which falls outside of the regular succession of -strands. The
size of the eyelet region of OmpF was 7 by 11 A˚ (152), very
close to the estimate of a diameter of 12 A˚ from sugar diffusion
studies (see above).
(v) The nature of the residues lining the channel wall pro-
vided a reasonable explanation of the diffusion characteristics
through porins. Thus, OmpF and PhoE prefer cations and
anions, respectively, despite having a 72% similarity in the
mature-protein sequence; this difference in charge preference
was shown to be due mainly to the replacement of Gly131 in
the eyelet region of OmpF with the positively charged Lys125
in PhoE (42, 152). The electrostatic properties of the OmpF
and PhoE channels were calculated and compared (322).
The OmpC channel appears to be slightly smaller than the
OmpF channel on the basis of diffusion rates of organic mol-
ecules (461, 462). Although the crystal structure of E. coli
OmpC is not yet known, the structure of an OmpC homolog
from Klebsiella pneumoniae has been determined (187). How-
ever, the size of the constriction region and the arrangement of
charged residues there are almost exactly the same as in
OmpF, and it is not easy to explain the difference in diffusion
rates. Schulz has pointed out that more charged residues are
pointing toward the pore lumen in OmpC (599). Perhaps this
may decrease the functional radius of the solute diffusion path-
way. Molecular dynamics simulation (see below) will be valu-
able in solving this question.
Lipophilicity in the solute molecule strongly retards its dif-
fusion through the porin channel (461, 462). Schulz explained
this effect by assuming that the structure of eyelet, in which the
cationic and anionic amino acid residues are located in the
opposite sides of the channel (Fig. 2C), orients the water mol-
ecules in the channels in a highly directional manner, making
the disruption of this ordered structure by hydrophobic solutes
energetically unfavorable (597).
OmpF, OmpC, and PhoE are so strongly similar in sequence
and also in their three-dimensional structure (as shown exper-
imentally for OmpF and PhoE [152]) that they apparently form
mixed trimers almost at random (217).
Regulation of porin expression. The regulation of expression
of nonspeciﬁc porins in E. coli is brieﬂy summarized. PhoE is
expressed only under phosphate starvation, since the phoE
gene is a member of the phosphate regulon (664). The expres-
sion of the two major porins, OmpF and OmpC, is exquisitely
regulated. The apparent purpose of this regulation became
clear when it was discovered that OmpF produces a slightly
larger channel than OmpC (461, 462). Thus, noxious agents
such as antibiotics and bile acids diffuse far better through the
larger OmpF channel, as seen clearly from the observation that
low concentrations of antibiotics select for ompF mutants but
never for ompC mutants (255) (see “Porins and antibiotic
resistance” below). In its natural habitat, the intestinal tract, E.
coli encounters 4 to 16 mM bile salts (84), and it is most
important to minimize their inﬂux. The conditions prevailing in
the intestinal tract, high osmotic strength and high tempera-
ture, both favor the production of OmpC (with its narrower
channel) and repress the production of OmpF (259). On the
other hand, the increased production of OmpF under low-
temperature, low-osmolarity conditions (for example, in lake
water) will beneﬁt E. coli by facilitating the inﬂux of scarce
nutrients. The molecular mechanisms of this regulation have
been studied extensively and reviewed in a clear and concise
manner (507). Thus, environmental osmotic activity is sensed
by the sensor component EnvZ of the archetypal two-compo-
nent system, EnvZ-OmpR, and high osmolarity results in the
phosphorylation of OmpR. The ompF gene, with its high af-
ﬁnity OmpR-binding sites, is transcribed even when the phos-
phorylated OmpR is scarce (i.e., under low-osmolarity condi-
tions). However, when the concentration of activated OmpR
increases, additional binding of these molecules results in in-
creased transcription of ompC and repression of ompF. High
temperature, on the other hand, increases the transcription of
an antisense RNA, micF (172) (A putative regulatory protein,
EnvY, has been reported to affect the temperature regulation
process [389], but its effect on micF transcription is not
known.) This RNA binds to the 5-region of the ompF mRNA
and inhibits its translation. More recently, another twist was
added to this complex regulatory network (383). When E. coli
is starved for carbon sources, OmpF production responds
strongly to the growth rate (or the concentration of glucose in
the medium). Finally, as described below, oxidative stress and
the presence of salicylate also increase micF transcription and
prevent the production of OmpF porin posttranscriptionally.
The intestinal tract, the normal environment of E. coli, is
thought to be mostly anaerobic. Interestingly, anaerobiosis was
found to modify the osmoregulation of OmpF and OmpC
(406). Thus, under anaerobiosis, OmpC is expressed at a rather
high level even in fairly low-osmolarity media, and the repres-
sion of OmpF by osmotic activity occurs more strongly than
under aerobic conditions. This modiﬁcation of the regulatory
response, which is expected to favor the survival of E. coli in
the intestinal tract, occurs through the cross talk activation of
OmpR by the ArcB sensor, which senses the anaerobic
condition.
Another environmental factor that acts in some cases
through the EnvZ-OmpR system is the medium pH (270). At
an acidic pH, such as 5.2, the production of OmpF porin

becomes strongly repressed and the expression of OmpC be-
comes increased. This acid induction phenomenon is quite
complex (658) and is affected additionally by the nature of the
carbon source. A partial explanation of this effect may be the
direct phosphorylation of OmpR by acetyl phosphate (269).
What advantage would the increased synthesis of OmpC con-
fer to the bacterium trying to survive in an acidic environment?
In terms of proton inﬂux, the small difference in the channel
size between OmpF and OmpC is unlikely to produce any
signiﬁcant difference in inﬂux. Perhaps a critical factor for
survival under acid-stressed conditions is the neutralization of
the periplasm, achieved by the decarboxylation of glutamate in
the cytoplasm followed by the export of -aminobutyrate into
the periplasm, where it may act as a buffer (83). In this sce-
nario, the narrower channel of OmpC may contribute to the
retention of these buffer molecules in the periplasm. The clo-
sure of porin channels by low pH and by endogenously syn-
thesized polyamines produced under acid stress (see “Regula-
tion of porin function” below) may also help in the same way.
The acid response involving OmpR also involves, in Salmonella
enterica serovar Typhimurium, the downstream two-compo-
nent regulatory system SsrAB, encoded by the genes in patho-
genicity island 2, and is essential for the survival of this species
inside macrophages (34, 368).
Regulation of porin expression also occurs in response to
chemicals in the environment. It was found in 1991 that salic-
ylate in the medium decreased OmpF synthesis (560). This is
now known to be a part of the global regulation of porins
mediated by three XylS-AraC family regulatory proteins,
MarA, SoxS, and Rob (9, 174). Thus, the increased production
of MarA (caused by some environmental chemicals, such as
salicylate, inactivating its cognate repressor, MarR) or SoxS
(caused by the inactivation of its repressor SoxR via its oxida-
tion) or the binding of coregulators such as dipyridyl (561) or
some bile salts (558) to Rob activates the transcription of micF
antisense RNA, decreasing OmpF synthesis. Interestingly, all
these environmental signals also result in the increased pro-
duction of the main multidrug efﬂux pump, AcrAB. Together,
these responses result in prevention of the inﬂux of toxic mol-
ecules, a reasonable response for E. coli. The beneﬁt is clear
from the observation that resistance to several antibiotics is
moderately increased in the presence of bile salts (558), a
normal component of the environment of E. coli.
A very interesting possibility is that R plasmids could bring
in a new regulatory element that would repress porin synthesis,
making the bacteria generally more resistant to drugs. An early
example is the ﬁnding by Iyer and coworkers (289, 290) that N
compatibility group R plasmids decrease drastically the syn-
thesis of OmpF porin when introduced into E. coli. Although
Iyer favored the interpretation that the preexisting ompF mu-
tants acted as a better recipient for the plasmids, it seems more
likely that the plasmid contains a gene that represses OmpF
synthesis. I am not aware of other studies in this potentially
important area, except that Rossouw and Rowbury (562)
showed that the presence of F compatibility group plasmid
R124 resulted in the repression of OmpF, causing increased
resistance to many agents.
Porin mutants. Benson et al. (49) used an ingenious ap-
proach to isolate porin mutants that allowed the diffusion of
large maltodextrins, which cannot diffuse through the wild-type
OmpF channel at signiﬁcant rates. These mutations changed
the large, charged residues (Arg82 or Asp113 in the pore
constriction [Fig. 2C]) into residues with smaller side chains,
such as serine, cysteine, or glycine, or resulted in short, in-
frame deletions of the L3 loop (152). The crystal structure of
these mutant proteins conﬁrmed the enlargement of the eyelet
(387) as expected. Surprisingly, the single-channel conduc-
tance in 1 M NaCl was not increased in any of the mutant
porins (571). This observation emphasizes the danger of using
single-channel conductance uncritically as the indicator for
channel size (described in “Functional assays” above). Con-
ductance is affected by the selectivity of the channel for cations
versus anions, and the total conductance is the sum of complex
factors. Indeed, a liposome-swelling assay with disaccharides
unequivocally showed that the mutant channels were larger
than the wild-type channels (571). Similar, larger-channel mu-
tants were also isolated in OmpC (419), and the enlargement
of the channels was conﬁrmed by biochemical studies (555).
In an interesting case, selection of colicin-N-resistant mu-
tants of E. coli produced a strain in which the Gly119 residue
of OmpF was mutated to Asp (305). This change essentially
divided the constriction zone of the channel into two smaller
channels, and drastically reduced the permeation rates of both
ions and sugars.
Site-directed mutagenesis studies were carried out with sam-
ples containing residues lining the eyelet region. However, the
results are not always easy to interpret. In one example in
which the channel assay was accompanied by a structural de-
termination by X-ray crystallography (590), an attempt was
made to narrow the eyelet of the Rhodopseudomonas blastica
porin (351) by replacing the residues surrounding the eyelet
with bulky tryptophan. The introduction of two or three tryp-
tophan residues narrowed the eyelet and indeed decreased
single-channel conductance, as expected. However, the intro-
duction of four or six tryptophan residues produced unstable
proteins. Similarly, replacement of four eyelet-surrounding
residues with alanine produced only a marginal (17%) increase
in eyelet cross-section in the X-ray structure, apparently be-
cause the remaining arginine side chain assumed a more ex-
panded conformation and narrowed the eyelet. The study by
Benson et al. of OmpF mutants (49), mentioned above, was
recently complemented by that of site-directed mutants (494).
Thus, converting the three arginine residues at the eyelet into
a much smaller alanine and converting the glutamate and as-
partate residues nearby to uncharged glutamine and aspara-
gine (see Fig. 2C for the location of these residues) produced
a 77% enlargement in the eyelet opening, as judged by crys-
tallography. However, the single-channel conductance of this
OmpF mutant was decreased by 30% in comparison to that of
the wild-type protein (494). Liposome swelling assay with di-
saccharides, however, showed that the permeation rates of
these large sugars was about eight times higher in the mutant.
Functional studies with new approaches. Computer simula-
tion of Brownian movement of cations and anions through
channels (589) has become a valuable tool in the study of
wild-type and mutant porins. This approach rather accurately
predicted the conductance behavior of various mutants with
site-directed mutations at the eyelet region of OmpF (494).
These analyses do have restrictions, however: only a single ion
was usually observed, so that ion-to-ion interaction was ne-

glected, the protein was assumed to have a rigid structure, and
the simulation still assumed that each ion behaves as an unhy-
drated, naked ion. In the most recent studies by Im and Roux
(286, 287), most of these limitations were overcome. Thus, a
molecular dynamics simulation involving more than 70,000 at-
oms, including an OmpF trimer, more than 100 phospholipid
molecules, 13,470 water molecules, and 231 K ions, and 201
Cl ions was carried out. Observations of great interest from
this simulation include the following. (i) The channel is re-
markably efﬁcient in taking up monovalent cations even from
micromolar solutions. (ii) The constriction “eyelet” of the
channel is very stable and shows no sign of closing during
simulation. (iii) Water molecules are strongly ordered at the
eyelet region, as predicted earlier (597). A recent analysis
combining molecular dynamics simulation with planar bilayer
studies suggests also that cations bind to an anionic side
chain(s) on the eyelet, most importantly Asp113, and that this
binding is signiﬁcant in the cation penetration across the chan-
nel (158). Therefore, the diffusion of preferred solutes through
the nonspeciﬁc porin channels occurs by a mechanism similar
to that through the speciﬁc channels (see “Speciﬁc channels”
below), in the sense that both involve solute (ligand) binding to
the channel wall. The difference between nonspeciﬁc porins
and speciﬁc channels has now become quantitative rather than
qualitative.
Atomic force microscopy has proven to be a useful tool to
examine the porin surface (583). Recently, observation in low
ionic strength solution detected the electrostatic potential on
the surface of porin trimers with very good resolution (496).
This may be a valuable method of determining the electrostatic
potentials on the surface of various proteins.
Single-channel experiments can now be carried out with
much reﬁnement, so that it is possible to observe the clogging
caused by the partitioning of polyethylene glycol into the
OmpF channel (563). Here polyethylene glycol 1360 was the
cutoff size for the OmpF porin, in comparison with polyethyl-
ene glycol 2200, which was the cutoff size for a larger, staph-
ylococcal alpha-toxin channel, a result showing excellent agree-
ment with the known diameters of these channels. Even more
impressively, transient clogging of the channel accompanying
the diffusion of antibiotic ampicillin through the OmpF chan-
nel could be observed and analyzed in single-channel experi-
ments (440).
Voltage gating. Planar lipid ﬁlm reconstitution of porins
showed from the earliest days that the channel can be closed
(“gated”) at high voltage, typically 100 mV or more (see ref-
erence 464 and references therein). Much effort has thus been
spent in understanding the structural basis of the gating phe-
nomenon. According to one hypothesis (103), transmembrane
voltages make the channel narrower by bringing the cationic
and anionic amino acid side chains closer to each other within
the channel. As mentioned above, the constriction zone, or
eyelet, of OmpF and PhoE contain acidic residues on the L3
loop and basic residues on the facing barrel wall (Fig. 2C).
Therefore, the movement of the loop containing the acidic
residues in response to voltage is in principle possible, as
shown by theoretical analysis (710). However, when the loop
was ﬁxed to the barrel wall by a disulﬁde bond, the gating still
occurred (29, 194, 492), a result that rules out at least a large-
scale movement of the loop against the barrel wall. Small
movements in parts of the loop are still possible, and some
molecular dynamics simulation studies (628, 659) indeed seem
to support this idea. Another possibility is the movement of
external loops that are located outside the channel in the
crystal structure. This mechanism was supported by an atomic
force microscopy study, in which the application of voltage was
shown to cause the movement of external loops, resulting in
the closure of channel entrance (433). With Haemophilus in-
ﬂuenzae porin, which shows signiﬁcant sequence homology to
E. coli porins (Fig. 1), this idea was supported by site-directed
mutagenesis as well as chemical modiﬁcation of basic amino
acid residues in the external loops (20, 21, 157).
When the results did not favor the movement of loop 3 in
gating, some workers took a broader look and considered the
fact that even the channel made by the -toxin of Staphylococ-
cus aureus, which is an empty 14-member -barrel with no
constrictions or infolding loops, shows typical gating behavior
in planar bilayers (28). They refer to the studies in which even
holes in a plastic ﬁlm (polyethylene terephthalate) were shown
to exhibit the gating phenomenon, presumably as a result of
the ﬂuctuation in the ionization of the charged groups either
within or near the channel (347). This is an extreme position,
but the possibility that gating can occur in the total absence of
conformational changes in channel proteins should be consid-
ered more seriously.
Regardless of the mechanism of the gating, we must ask if
the phenomenon has any physiological signiﬁcance. It is difﬁ-
cult to imagine the presence of such a high membrane poten-
tial across the OM, and distribution of ions across the OM,
which measures directly the potential, show that only low (less
than 30 mV) values of Donnan potential exist here (601). This
Donnan potential was of the size expected from the presence,
in the periplasm, of polyanionic oligosaccharides (membrane-
derived oligosaccharides [MDO]) (333) that cannot diffuse
through the porin channels. Therefore, clearly there is no large
electrical potential across the OM. In the days when the struc-
ture of porins was completely unknown, the observation of
gating encouraged some workers to propose that porins might
serve as “models” of voltage-gated ion channels in nerve cells,
for example. However, we now know that real voltage-gated
ion channels are constructed in a totally different manner, and
the porin gating observed under these high-voltage conditions
may be no more than an interesting laboratory artifact. At
lower voltages, the open states often last for many seconds (or
even minutes) (168), and this also gives an impression that
porin channels are normally open at least most of the time. In
retrospect, the emphasis on voltage gating could have pro-
duced more confusion rather than enlightenment. The most
obvious possible beneﬁt of the voltage gating of porins may be
to prevent the formation of open channels when porins are
misincorporated into the cytoplasmic membrane. A similar
beneﬁt may also apply to the (voltage-gated) mitochondrial
porin, which apparently becomes inserted occasionally into
other membranes of the eukaryotic cell (657).
On the other hand, it was argued that the gating occurs in
the OM of living cells. This argument was supported most
strongly by early studies involving patch clamping of the mem-
branes of E. coli spheroplasts. The open state was much less
stable, and the closure occurred at lower voltages (periplasmic
side negative). This behavior is ascribed to the more “natural”
VOL. 67, 2003

environment occupied by the porins here (168, 169). A patch of
the size used in these early studies should have contained close
to 105 porin monomers if it came from the OM. However, in
reports of patch clamping of E. coli “OM,” only a dozen or so
open channels were observed in a patch (559). These data
seemed to imply that an overwhelming majority of porin chan-
nels were closed in intact cells and that they opened only under
speciﬁc conditions such as starvation (168, 169).
Although a microscopic observation suggested that the OM
was intact in the spheroplasts (107), the same paper reported
that the patches also contained stretch-activated channels
(107), now known to be a component of the inner membrane
(642). Therefore, it seems possible, even likely, that these early
patch clamp studies using spheroplasts observed the behavior
of the inner membrane, containing perhaps a very few porin
channels misincorporated into the wrong membrane, or that
patches were made on mixed membrane fragments. This view
is now shared by one of the authors of these early papers (A.
Delcour, personal communication). Consistent with this inter-
pretation, we can calculate the permeability coefﬁcient of the
OM in intact cells to uncharged or zwitterionic solutes of a
known size on the basis of the cross-section of the always-open
porin channels in the OM (460). This calculation yields the
predicted permeability coefﬁcient, P, of 2.5 m/s for lactose
(342 Da), a value quite close to the measured value of P of 1
m/s (601) for a zwitterionic antibiotic of a comparable size
(415 Da), cephaloridine. This agreement again reinforces the
notion that most of the porin channels are open in intact E. coli
cells.
Indeed, the porin channels were open most of the time, even
when investigated by the patch clamp method, if OM frag-
ments were diluted into a large excess of phospholipid bilayers
(171). Using this latter system, functional studies were carried
out. The addition of MDO produced prolonged closure of E.
coli porin channels (170). The physiological signiﬁcance of this
observation is not clear. First, the closure required about 10
mM MDO. This is not an excessively high concentration in
cells grown in low-osmolarity media, but once the cells are
grown in more physiologically relevant media of moderate
osmolarity (for example, containing 0.3 M NaCl) the MDO
concentration decreases almost 20-fold (601). Second, the clo-
sure could be seen only when the voltage across the membrane
was periplasmic-side positive, opposite of the direction of the
Donnan potential. Delcour argues that inside-positive poten-
tial could be created by the inﬂux of cations when bacteria are
diluted into a high-salt medium (168), but this has not been
demonstrated experimentally. Perhaps the most interesting ob-
servation of this group was that polyamines increased the clo-
sure of porin channels in patch clamp experiments; since it
seems likely that this represents closure, rather than intensiﬁed
voltage gating, these data are discussed in the next section.
Regulation of porin function. Delcour’s group observed that
polyamines affected the permeability of porin channels not
only in artiﬁcial membranes (166) but also in intact cells when
measured with cephalorididine inﬂux (167). The effect was
modest when the polyamines were added to the medium; a
40% decrease in OmpF permeability required the addition of
100 mM putrescine, 60% inhibition required 30 mM spermi-
dine, and 70% required 1 mM spermine. These polyamine
concentrations can be compared to the total intracellular con-
centrations of putrescine and spermidine, 20 and 6 mM, re-
spectively (which are mostly tied up by polyanionic macro-
moles such as ribosomes and LPS), and the inability of E. coli
to synthesize spermine (643). However, Samartzidou and Del-
cour (574) made an important observation that when E. coli is
synthesizing and excreting cadaverine, the OM permeability
decreases to about 30% of the normal level. In an experiment
in which acid stress was used to induce cadaverine synthesis,
the decrease in OM permeability could be interpreted as the
result of increase in OmpC and decrease in OmpF, a part of
the acid pH response (see “Regulation of porin expression”
above). However, in the experiment where cadaverine synthe-
sis was controlled by a lactose promoter, the decrease is un-
likely to be the result of anything other than the cadaverine
synthesis and excretion. The concentration of cadaverine in the
medium, after 1 h of induction, was only 0.2 mM. Thus, sur-
prisingly low concentrations of endogenously produced cadav-
erine exerted this profound effect in intact cells, although ca-
daverine needed to be present at 300 mM for 50 to 60%
inhibition of porin activity when added to the external medium.
Perhaps the constant efﬂux of cadaverine from the periplasm
tends to close the porin channel more effectively (574). (It
should be noted that the channel closing is not the result of
voltage gating but appears to be the result of direct interaction
between the polyamines and the interior of the channel [291]).
It is also likely that polyamine synthesis and export, as a part of
the acid stress response, are meant to lead to the neutralization
of the periplasm and that closing of the porin channels tends to
build up high concentrations of polyamines in the periplasm by
retarding the release of polyamines into the medium (see
“Regulation of porin expression” above). Thus, the polyamine
effect seems to be truly signiﬁcant in bacterial physiology. In-
deed, this point was proven in a recent study in which a strain
producing
polyamine-resistant
OmpC
(with
the
Gly195
changed to Asp) was shown to be more susceptible to acid
shock (575).
A single-channel conductance assay of OmpF and OmpC by
Todt et al. (662) showed that the conductance value was low-
ered to almost one-half by going from pH 8.1 to 5.4. A lipo-
some-swelling assay also was reported to show a similar de-
crease in permeability. However, the authors’ ﬁnding of very
high permeation rate for maltose (about 60% of the rate for
glucose at pH 9.4) is quite unexpected, because in our hands
disaccharides usually penetrate through the OmpF channel
with rates that are about 2 orders of magnitude lower than that
of glucose (460, 461). The same group suspected the partici-
pation of the sole histidine residue of OmpF or OmpC in this
switching of channel size and reported that diethylpyrocarbon-
ate modiﬁcation of His21 abolished this pH-induced alteration
of pore function (661). However, another laboratory could not
reproduce the acidic-pH-induced alteration of pore size and
saw no effect of a His21-to-Thr substitution (572). The latter
authors suggest that the different results were possibly ob-
tained because of the presence of LPS in the porin prepara-
tions used by the earlier workers. This explanation seems rea-
sonable because Todt et al. (660) showed that the alteration of
channel size can be seen in whole E. coli cells. This important
issue needs renewed attention.
Evolution of porins. In the real world, the exposed external
loops of porins interact with antibodies, phages, and colicins.
602

----- Page 11 (native) -----
For example, OmpF (together with LPS) is the receptor for
phage K20 (616, 666) and for colicins A and N (210). The
speciﬁc maltodextrin channel LamB was initially known only as
the receptor for phage lambda. Therefore, it is understandable
that these loops underwent rapid evolutionary alterations in
structure, as seen clearly by comparisons of sequences of the
same (orthologous) porin from different strains of the same
species or from strains belonging to the related species (the
latter is seen in Fig. 1). In contrast, comparison of porins of
Rhodobacter capsulatus strains kept for more than 30 years in
separate laboratories (that is, in the absence of external selec-
tive agents) revealed that changes occurred nearly exclusively
in the transmembrane strands (677).
“Evolution” experiments can be carried out in the labora-
tory. When E. coli was grown for a few hundred generations in
chemostat under glucose-limited conditions, mutations that
resulted in the overproduction of the speciﬁc LamB channel
(which also facilitates the diffusion of glucose [see “Speciﬁc
channels” below]) were regularly observed (465). In contrast,
when a disaccharide lactose was the sole carbon source in a
minimal medium, “evolved” strains overproduced the larger-
channel porin OmpF over OmpC and, moreover, contained
ompF mutations that altered the residues in the constriction
region (Arg82 and Asp113) (Fig. 2C) or resulted in a short
deletion in the channel-constricting loop L3 (780). These are
precisely the mutations found by Benson et al. (49), who
looked for larger channel mutants of OmpF; indeed, the pres-
ence of the larger channel in the evolved strains was conﬁrmed
by their hypersusceptibility to large antibiotics such as cloxacil-
lin. This experiment shows that the porin channel can become
limiting for the diffusion of even disaccharides when their
concentration is low. Furthermore, the experiment is impor-
tant in two other areas. (i) Such “evolution” obviously does not
take place in nature, in spite of the obvious advantage of the
larger channel. This is consistent with the idea that in its
natural habitat, E. coli must balance the desirability of more
efﬁcient uptake of nutrients against the danger of more rapid
inﬂux of toxic compounds, especially bile salts. It would be
interesting to repeat the in vitro evolution experiment in the
presence of bile salts. (ii) If the porin channels are mostly
closed, as claimed by some workers, the mutations will occur in
the regions of porin protein that affect the voltage-induced
closing. The constriction zone is not such an area, as described
above. Therefore, the results do not favor the idea of normally
closed porin channels.
Slow Porins
OprF is the major porin in P. aeruginosa. The study of what
I now propose to call “slow porins” has had a long, tortuous,
and sometimes acrimonious history. It began with the identi-
ﬁcation of protein OprF as the major porin of Pseudomonas
aeruginosa (246). This porin is very different from the trimeric,
classical porins. (i) There is no strong evidence that it exists as
a stable oligomer. (ii) On reconstitution into proteoliposomes,
it allows a much slower diffusion of small solutes such as
monosaccharides (in one experiment, the inﬂux of arabinose
was 50 times slower than through the E. coli OmpF channel
[767]) but allows the diffusion of much larger solutes that
cannot penetrate through the OmpF channel (246). Although
the low permeation rates were in agreement with the very low
permeability of intact P. aeruginosa OM, measured by using
hydrophilic solutes such as cephaloridine (19, 766), the appar-
ent contradiction between the large pore size and the lower
penetration rates was unexpected, and some simplistic “solu-
tions” were proposed (see below). (iii) When the oprF gene
was sequenced, it was found to be a homolog of E. coli OmpA
protein, which at that time was not known to have a channel
function. This ﬁnding further added skepticism about the porin
function of OprF. (d) The mobility of OprF and OmpA in
sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) decreases when the samples are heated at 100°C,
a property often called heat modiﬁability.
Nakae and coworkers criticized almost every aspect of the
concept of OprF as the major P. aeruginosa porin (references
are cited in reference 459). The argument was based on results
that purportedly showed that the porin channels in the intact P.
aeruginosa OM was much narrower, instead of wider, than the
E. coli porin channels and that the puriﬁed OprF lacked pore-
forming activity. This group also claimed that the major porins
in P. aeruginosa were OM proteins other than OprF. Careful
reexamination of the data published by this group showed,
however, that their claims could not be substantiated (459).
The claim for the narrower channel was based on an improper
and arbitrary way of plotting the permeation rate versus the
solute size. Puriﬁcation of OprF following their procedure
produced an active pore-forming protein, with a wide channel
and low penetration rates. Finally comparison of various P.
aeruginosa OM proteins for nonspeciﬁc porin activity showed
that OprF was the major porin in this organism.
Even more decisive was the study from the laboratory of
Hancock (46). They showed, by expressing genes for the me-
tabolism of rafﬁnose (MW 505) in P. aeruginosa, that oprF
cells, but not an oprF mutant, can grow readily by utilizing this
sugar. Since rafﬁnose cannot diffuse through E. coli general
porin channels at sufﬁcient rates, this is the ultimate proof that
the larger pore size of OprF channel is not an in vitro artifact
and that the major porin of P. aeruginosa is indeed OprF.
The apparent dilemma of low permeability through a large
channel. Although it has been established that OprF is the
major porin, it was difﬁcult to explain why solutes penetrated
the P. aeruginosa OM at rates about 2 orders of magnitude
lower than the rates at which they penetrated the E. coli OM
(19, 766), because the number of OprF molecules per cell was
similar to that of the major porins in E. coli and because the
larger channel in OprF porin was expected to result in a faster,
not slower, diffusion of solutes. The answer to this question
came through the studies of E. coli OmpA, a homolog of OprF.
Like OprF, OmpA also produces permeability on reconstitu-
tion into proteoliposomes, but the diffusion rates of solutes are
about 2 orders of magnitude lower than in proteoliposomes
containing comparable amounts of classical porins (638). (The
channel-forming activity of OmpA was also conﬁrmed by a
planar lipid bilayer assay [24, 570]). When unilamellar proteo-
liposomes each containing only a few molecules of OmpA were
fractionated on the basis of permeability to sucrose, only a
small percentage of the OmpA molecules were found to have
the ability to form open channels (636). A similar experiment
using OprF also showed that the OprF population was hetero-
geneous, with only a minority containing the open channel (E.

These data explain the slow permeation of solutes mediated
by OmpA and OprF but leave open the question of the nature
of the difference between the “open” and “closed” proteins.
OmpA has always been hypothesized to fold as a two-domain
protein (545), with its N-terminal half spanning the OM as an
eight-strand -barrel and its C-terminal segment located in the
periplasm and interacting with the peptidoglycan layer (173,
342) (Fig. 3, Majority Conformer). This folding model is sup-
ported by a large amount of convincing data, beginning with
the location of phage resistance mutations in the predicted
external loops (429) and culminating in the determination of
the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of OmpA as an
eight-stranded -barrel (488, 489). Since the eight-stranded
-barrel has little room inside for the passage of even small
molecules, this conformer cannot serve as an open channel for
the passage of organic solutes. (However, N-terminal domains
of both OmpA and OprF were shown to produce very small
conductance steps [24, 100], and these observations have been
rationalized by the recent molecular dynamics simulation study
[81]).
The open conformers, in contrast, are likely to contain more
-strands like the classical porins (Fig. 3, Minority Con-
former). In fact, a model assuming that OprF folds essentially
as a continuous -barrel, containing up to 16 transmembrane
-strands as in the classical porins, was proposed (534, 747).
The surface exposure of residues in the C-terminal region was
indeed conﬁrmed, for example, by inserting malarial antigen
epitopes at various places in the OprF sequence (748). Such an
OmpF-OmpC-like folding model, however, cannot explain the
low permeability of the OprF porin. Furthermore, a circular
dichroism study of the OprF protein isolated without the use of
denaturing detergent showed clearly that at least the majority
of OprF molecules, just like OmpA, contained a substantial
fraction of helical structures (presumably coming from the
periplasmic, globular domain of the two-domain conforma-
tion) (639), in contrast to the essentially all -structure pre-
dicted from the earlier model. The heat modiﬁability of OprF
(and OmpA) is also likely to be explained by the two-domain
conformation of the majority conformer, since the N-terminal
-barrel will not be denatured in SDS unless the protein is
heated (639). However, if we assume that only the minority,
open-channel conformer of OprF takes the one-domain con-
formation, as with OmpA (636), then we can explain the low
permeability of OprF and all other available data on this pro-
tein. Thus, the epitopes in the C-terminal half of OprF will be
exposed on the surface of intact cells, if they exist in the loop
region of the continuous -barrel conformer. However, be-
cause this conformer represents a minority fraction of OprF,
the reactivity of such epitopes will be substantially lower than
that of the same epitopes located in the loop region of the
N-terminal half. In retrospect, this was precisely the result
obtained (748), although it was not interpreted in this manner
at that time.
Recently, the current model of OmpA and OprF (Fig. 3) has
received strong experimental support. The model predicts that
the N-terminal fragment (alone) of these proteins will not
produce signiﬁcant permeability because it contains only the
eight-stranded -barrel and that the entire protein sequence is
needed to produce an approximately 16-stranded -barrel that
would allow the permeation of large molecules. Indeed, Arora
et al. (24) obtained such a result by using our OmpA prepa-
ration that was enriched for open conformers (see below), and
this was soon followed by similar papers dealing with OprF
(100, 190).
The two-conformer model of OmpA-OprF is thus quite use-
ful and is likely to be correct. The model has received further
support. The C-terminal domain of OmpA (as well as that of
OprF) contains the immunodominant epitope, which is present
on the surface of intact bacteria on the basis of studies using
ﬂuorescent-labeled antibodies. However, these data appeared
to be inconsistent with the two-domain model of these pro-
teins. A recent study showed that the reaction, with S. enterica
serovar Typhimurium cells, of monoclonal antibodies directed
to the C-terminal domain of OmpA was dramatically enhanced
when the OM was made permeable to these antibodies, con-
ﬁrming that the C-terminal domain was exposed only in mi-
nority conformers (621). If residues in the C-terminal domain
of OprF are exposed on the cell surface only in the minority
conformer containing open channels, one should be able to
enrich for this conformer by inserting an additional cysteine
residue in one of the predicted external loops, by labeling the
residue with a biotinylation reagent in intact cells, and by
capturing this conformer (but not the majority conformer, in
which the cysteine residue is hidden in the periplasm) via
binding to avidin. We have indeed been able to enrich for the
biotin-labeled species and to show that this species has higher
speciﬁc activity in terms of pore formation (E. Sugawara, E. K.
FIG. 3. Folding model of OmpA-OprF family slow porins. The
major fraction of the population folds as a two-domain protein (left)
and is important in binding the OM to the underlying peptidoglycan,
since the C-terminal globular domain contains a peptidoglycan-binding
motif (165, 342). A minor fraction of the population, however, folds
differently to produce an open -barrel (right). In E. coli, which pro-
duces trimeric, high-permeability porins, the presence of this fraction
has no functional consequence. However, in ﬂuorescent pseudo-
monads, which lack the high-permeability porin, this fraction functions
as the major nonspeciﬁc porin. This fraction also tends to form a
loosely associated oligomeric structure, as shown. The oligomer is
shown as a trimer only for illustrative purposes. Modiﬁed from refer-

Nestrovich, S. M. Bezrukov, and H. Nikaido, unpublished
data). Even more intriguing is the observation that the open-
channel conformers tend to have a larger size (637), presum-
ably in an oligomeric form. We have again been able to utilize
this property and enrich the OmpA and OprF preparation for
their open conformers (Sugawara et al., unpublished data).
There is therefore no longer any controversy about the porin
functions of OprF and OmpA, in spite of several reviews that
argue that their porin function is controversial or unsubstan-
tiated (see, for example, reference 343). Presumably the C-
terminal portion of their majority conformer stabilizes the cell
envelope structure through their interaction with peptidogly-
can (173, 342, 533), and this is their primary function. How-
ever, in organisms that lack the classical trimeric porin, such as
ﬂuorescent pseudomonads, the protein of this family functions
as the major porin and contributes to the high levels of intrinsic
resistance to toxic agents through their low permeability. At
least in one strain of P. ﬂuorescens, the deletion of oprF gene is
followed by compensatory suppressor mutations resulting in
the overexpression of OprD family channel proteins (described
in “Speciﬁc channels in bacteria other than the Enterobacteri-
aceae” below), a result that convincingly demonstrates that
OprF functions as the major porin (130). It is remarkable that
OprF-OmpA family proteins are found in almost every gram-
negative bacterial genome sequenced; they may serve as the
major
porin
also
in
some
organisms
other
than
the
pseudomonads.
One remaining question, though, is whether the two folding
pathways of these proteins are regulated. In this connection, P.
ﬂuorescens was found to produce OprF of lower single-channel
conductance when grown at low temperature (163). Although
low ionic conductance cannot be immediately equated with
smaller channels (see “Classical porins” above), the low-tem-
perature conformer is more susceptible to protease hydrolysis
(190), as expected for the two-domain conformer, and it seems
likely that the growth temperature affects the folding of OprF,
at least in this organism.
Other Porins
Other porins in E. coli and Salmonella. The genome of E.
coli K-12 codes for several general-purpose porins other than
OmpF-OmpC-PhoE. The NmpC porin, which belongs to the
OmpF-OmpC-PhoE cluster and which is not expressed in K-12
because of the insertion of the IS 5 element close to the distal
end of the gene, is essentially identical to the lc porin coded by
the genome of a lambdoid phage, PA-2 (71). Indeed, the nmpC
gene is a part of the genome of a defective phage inserted into
the E. coli chromosome; this ﬁnding suggests that phages
sometimes code for a new porin gene, which would help in the
rapid biosynthesis of phage material by allowing a rapid inﬂux
of nutrients. The NmpC sequence is more similar to OmpF-
PhoE than to OmpC in that it lacks the long insertion that is
found in OmpC in loop 3. It is more similar to PhoE than to
OmpF, in that it lacks the small insertion of OmpF in loop 6,
but it retains Gly131 (OmpF numbering), which is crucial in
the cation selectivity of OmpF (see above). The transcription
of nmpC is apparently up-regulated by growth in a slightly
alkaline media (140).
A recent survey of the K-12 genome using a program de-
tecting -barrel proteins indicated that the product of gene
b1377 is a homolog of OmpC belonging to the classical porin
family (778). Actually this trimeric porin, called OmpN, was
originally found in E. coli B and then in K-12 and was ex-
pressed and puriﬁed (510). Its channel property was also re-
ported to be very similar to that of OmpC. This protein is
apparently expressed at a very low level in wild-type strains; I
am not aware of any report on the effect of environmental
conditions on the production of this porin.
S. enterica serovar Typhimurium produces OmpD, an addi-
tional member of the classical porin family. It has channel
properties comparable to those of OmpF-OmpC as judged
from single-channel conductance data (51). Liposome-swelling
studies apparently have not been carried out with this porin.
Interestingly, the synthesis of this porin is dependent on cyclic
AMP (B. Rotman and G. F.-L. Ames, personal communica-
tion). The gene ompD is located downstream of the putative
transporter gene yddG, and recently the inactivation of either
of these genes was reported to cause hypersusceptibility to
methyl viologen (577). The authors propose that the OmpD
porin forms a multiprotein complex with the YddG pump,
playing the role of the exit channel like TolC. However, OmpD
does not contain the periplasmic “tunnel” found in TolC (see
“export channels of the TolC family” below). Furthermore,
this reviewer found that homologs of yddG gene in other or-
ganisms occur without the neighboring ompD-homologous
gene. A porin not corresponding to OmpF and OmpC was
reported in S. enterica serovar Enteritidis and was called
OmpE (126). The nomenclature suggests that the authors were
aware of the presence of OmpD, yet they did not compare
their porin with OmpD. The production pattern of this porin
on complex agar media and in synthetic liquid media seems to
ﬁt with the idea that it is actually OmpD that is synthesized in
a cyclic AMP-dependent manner.
Mutants expressing OmpG porin were isolated in E. coli
K-12 by Misra and Benson (420) by using a selection procedure
that favors mutant cells capable of taking up large nutrients.
OmpG is a porin with unusual properties (197). First, it ap-
pears to lack, on the basis of its sequence, the large loop 3 that
is ubiquitous in classical trimeric porins. Second, it produces an
unusually large channel, as expected from this structure. Third,
it appears to exist as a monomer, unlike members of the clas-
sical porin family. The large channel size and the monomeric
nature of OmpG were conﬁrmed by single-channel conduc-
tance and folding studies in another laboratory (143, 144). The
protein was made into a two-dimensional crystal, and its study
also conﬁrms the monomeric nature of this porin (45). The
ompG gene appears to be the last gene in a putative 11-gene
operon, which contains genes needed for the ATP-binding
cassette (ABC) transporter-catalyzed uptake of oligosaccha-
rides, as well as various genes presumably involved in the
degradation of such compounds (197). Therefore, it seems
likely that it is a large-channel porin needed for the uptake of
larger oligosaccharides. OmpG is expressed, at a low level, in
Salmonella and Shigella, but only trace levels are seen in wild-
type E. coli K-12.
The ompL gene of K-12 was identiﬁed by transposon inser-
tion mutagenesis as a gene whose inactivation made a dsbA
mutant more dithiothreitol resistant (159). Its sequence sug-

gests that it may exist as a -barrel in the OM, and the puriﬁed
OmpL showed porin activity. One could explain the phenotype
of ompL mutants if it were assumed that OmpL facilitated the
outward diffusion of hypothetical, low-molecular-weight oxi-
dizing agents in the periplasm, but recent attempts to repro-
duce the reported phenotypes of ompL and ompL dsbA mutant
strains have failed (578). OmpL is not expressed at a high level
in wild-type cells and presumably plays only a minor role in the
ﬂux of nutrients in general. Recently, OmpL was found to be a
homolog of the Erwinia chrysanthemi oligogalacturonate chan-
nel protein, KdgM (490) (see “Other speciﬁc channels”
below).
E. coli OmpW, a small (191 residues in the mature form)
OM protein, is used by a colicin as a receptor (498); otherwise,
its function is unknown. Interestingly, this protein belongs to a
homology group that includes P. putida AlkL, which is hypoth-
esized to be an alkane channel (690), and NahQ (SwissProt
accession no. Q51498), which is part of the cluster coding for
naphthalene utilization and is also likely to code for an OM
channel. This AlkL-OmpW group also includes Omp21 of Co-
mamonas acidovorans, which was studied as a two-dimensional
crystal (31) and showed patterns similar to other eight-strand
-barrel proteins. With slow porins like OmpA and OprF,
there was a possibility of alternative folding to produce large
channels. However, it is currently unclear how these small
proteins of the AlkL-OmpW group would produce sizable
channels, if they indeed function as channels.
Many other small OM proteins are known (701) or sus-
pected (31) to produce eight-stranded -barrels. These include
OmpX of E. coli (701), opacity proteins of Neisseria, and Ail
protein of Yersinia. More recently, PagP, the enzyme that
transfers a palmitoyl residue from phospholipid to lipid A
(discussed in “Physiological adaptation in LPS structure” be-
low), was shown to be an eight-stranded -barrel protein by
solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)
(285). One example of the opacity protein family protein was
actually shown by X-ray crystallography to have a 10-strand
-barrel structure (511), and another example from this family,
NspA, was recently characterized to be an 8-strand -barrel
protein (691). As Baldermann and Engelhardt argue (31), what
is important in these proteins are the external loops that may
be needed for interaction with the external structure, such as
the surface of the host cell membrane or the substrates of
enzyme reaction, and the 8- or 10-strand -barrel may simply
serve as the OM anchor. None of these proteins has been
shown to form channels, as far as I am aware. Other examples
where OM-spanning -barrels are thought to function as sim-
ple anchors include OmpT and OmpLA. The crystal structure
of OmpT, an OM-associated protease, shows that its 10-strand
-barrel protrudes far beyond the plane of the OM bilayer and
that the membrane-external portion of the barrel and the loops
apparently function in proteolysis (692). In OmpLA, the OM-
associated phospholipase A, the structure shows a 12-strand
-barrel (625), yet the interior of the barrel appears to be
occluded by a dense hydrogen-bonding network, and the pro-
tein is not thought to function as a channel.
Most E. coli strains, including K-12 and B, are incapable of
metabolizing rafﬁnose, a trisaccharide. However, some strains
contain plasmids that contain genes for degradation and trans-
port of this sugar. One of the genes is rafY, which produces an
OM channel (353). When RafY, a fairly large (50.7-kDa) pro-
tein that exists as a trimer, was inserted into a planar lipid
bilayer, it produced a high single-channel conductance of 2.9
nS in 1 M KCl (16). Interestingly, however, there was no
blocking of the channel by several sugars, including rafﬁnose.
Although negative results must be interpreted with caution, it
seems likely that RafY, unlike such speciﬁc channels as LamB
or ScrY (which shows low single-channel conductance that is
blocked by sugars), simply produces a pore large enough for
the inﬂux of trisaccharides. RafY does not appear to be
strongly similar to other known porins or channel proteins.
Porins in members of the Enterobacteriaceae other than E.
coli and Salmonella. Among porins of members of the Enter-
obacteriaceae other than the E. coli-Shigella-Salmonella cluster,
those from Serratia have been studied in several laboratories.
In an early study (518), S. marcescens was found to produce
two major (and one minor) porin-like proteins. The ompF and
ompC genes were characterized (283, 284), but the properties
of the channels were not studied. The upstream operator re-
gion of the ompF gene in this species appears truncated in
comparison with that of E. coli, in such a way that would make
the repression of OmpF by high osmotic activity much less
efﬁcient. This seems to ﬁt with the natural habitat of this
saprophytic organism, which would derive little advantage by
shutting down larger channels under high-osmolarity condi-
tions. An early study (396) utilizing a clinical isolate showed
the predominant production of the OmpC-like porin, with OM
permeability to cephaloridine that was similar to that of E. coli
(462). Interestingly, a study using a clinical isolate with high-
level resistance to a wide range of cephalosporins showed OM
permeability that was about an order of magnitude lower than
that found in E. coli (530); it is possible that this strain con-
tained mutations in a porin gene(s). Perhaps the low general
permeability, due to lowered porin expression, mutations in
porin genes, or both, is a general hallmark of many strains of
clinical origin (see also “porins and antibiotic resistance” be-
low); in this respect, it is interesting that enterohemorrhagic E.
coli O157:H7 was recently shown to have much lower OM
permeability to a hydrophilic, anionic compound than the lab-
oratory strain K-12 (401).
Enterobacter cloacae also produces homologs of OmpF and
OmpC (319) (GenBank accession numbers CAC48382 and
CAC48383). Interestingly, the OM permeability of a clinical
strain of E. cloacae was more than an order of magnitude lower
than that of E. coli K-12 when the monoanionic cephalosporin
cefazolin (704) or the zwitterionic compound cephaloridine
(458) was used as the probe. An especially large fraction of
-lactam-resistant clinical isolates of Enterobacter aerogenes
were found to have alterations in porins (125). Since this spe-
cies contains an inducible chromosomal cephalosporinase
(509), this result is not easy to explain. Perhaps the modest
extent of induction of this enzyme, seen in a reference strain
(125), may be relevant. An example of alteration of porin
structure is described in “Porins and antibiotic resistance”
(below).
Klebsiella pneumoniae is unusual among the Enterobacteri-
aceae in lacking the ability to produce a chromosomally en-
coded, inducible class C -lactamase and instead produces a
chromosomally encoded, weak class A enzyme (491). Thus,
they become resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporins

such as cefotaxime and ceftazidime primarily through the ac-
quisition of plasmids with genes coding for mutated class A
enzymes with wider speciﬁcity (495) rather than by the consti-
tutive production of class C chromosomal enzymes (295). This
situation also suggests that the loss of porin might play a larger
role in the resistance of K. pneumoniae to -lactams. This
species produces two porins (319, 580). Genes coding for these
two porins were later cloned, and their sequences were con-
ﬁrmed to correspond to E. coli ompF (coding for OmpK35)
and ompC (coding for OmpK36), respectively (267). As men-
tioned above, the crystal structure of the OmpC homolog
OmpK36 is known (187). In an intriguing study, it was found
that a K. pneumoniae strain from a patient lacked one of these
porins. A later, more cephalosporin-resistant isolate from the
same patient was deﬁcient even in this remaining porin, and
introduction of a plasmid coding for OmpK36 resulted in the
regaining of drug susceptibility (402) (see, however, “Porins
and antibiotic resistance” [below] for more on these results). In
carbapenem-resistant strains lacking both of the porins (404),
the decreased OM permeability is likely to play a role in
resistance.
Biochemical studies of porins from Proteus vulgaris, Proteus
mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, and Provi-
dencia alcalifaciens suggested that each of these species pro-
duced predominantly a single porin with a subunit size of
around 35 to 37 kDa (422). Proteoliposome swelling studies
showed pore sizes similar to that in E. coli porins, and the
channels favored more hydrophilic members among cephalo-
sporins, just as in E. coli (462). All porins, just like E. coli
porins, were cation selective, as indicated by the preference for
zwitterionic cephaloridine over monoanionic cephalosporins,
with the interesting exception of the P. vulgaris porin, which
allowed inﬂux, at equal rates, of these two classes of compounds.
The OmpC homolog in Yersinia enterocolitica was shown to
be a trimeric porin with the expected single channel conduc-
tance (104). Disruption of ompF and ompC in this organism
led to decreases in OM permeability (105).
A nematode symbiont, Xenorhabdus nematophilus, which is
required for the nematode to kill the host insects, predictably
produced a trimeric porin, OpnP, that resembled the E. coli
porins (209). Also, in this case the gene lacked the regulatory
region needed for its repression under high-osmolarity con-
ditions.
The OmpC porin from Rahnella aquatilis, a rhizosphere bac-
terium, shows strong homology to other enterobacterial OmpC
proteins and also acts as a root adhesin (4). This is one of many
examples where surface-exposed OM proteins were shown to
play an additional role in the interaction with the environment.
Photobacterium and Vibrio are phylogenetically close to the
Enterobacteriaceae, and their porins are discussed here. A ma-
jor OM protein (35 to 42 kDa) of Vibrio (now Listonella)
anguillarum was puriﬁed and made into a two-dimensional
crystal (617). The protein was a trimer and showed conductiv-
ity properties similar to those of E. coli OmpF. The sequence
of this protein is unknown. The deep-sea Photobacterium sp.
strain SS9 (Photobacterium profundum) has been studied ex-
tensively. At atmospheric pressure, it produces predominantly
an “OmpL” protein (34.7 kDa), which shows homology to
enterobacterial porins (719). This protein is also an oligomeric
porin, and its complete denaturation requires boiling in 2%
SDS. At higher pressures, however, another porin, “OmpH,”
(31.1 kDa) (37), is preferentially produced (132). This regula-
tion apparently involves an extracytoplasmic function sigma
factor, RpoE (131), and proteins that are expected to regulate
the RpoE activity (36). We do not yet know, however, the
properties of OmpL and OmpH that might make them suitable
for environments with different pressures. Vibrio vulniﬁcus was
shown to express, depending on the growth medium, a few
porin-like proteins (345); with the recent sequencing of the
genome
of
this
species
(GenBank
accession
numbers
NC004459 and NC004460), a more detailed study may appear
in the future. Vibrio cholerae is known to produce two porins:
OmpU (120), whose transcription is activated by the regulatory
protein ToxR (155), and OmpT, which is repressed by ToxR
(374). Cells expressing OmpU exclusively are more resistant to
bile salts than are those expressing OmpT alone (513, 514). E.
coli cells expressing only the narrower-channel porin OmpC
are also more resistant to bile salts than are those expressing
the wider-channel porin OmpF (653). These results are con-
sistent with the assumption that OmpU produces a narrower
channel than does OmpT (although a contrary conclusion was
drawn earlier on the basis of liposome-swelling data [120]).
This notion is also supported by the observation that OmpT-
expressing cells allow faster penetration of a zwitterionic ceph-
alosporin, cephaloridine, across the OM than do OmpU-ex-
pressing cells (727). Recent patch clamp results are also
consistent with this, since the single-channel conductance val-
ues for OmpU and OmpT were, respectively, about 50 and 350
pS in 150 mM NaCl (618); the authors, however, favor the
interpretation that these conductance values represent the in-
sertion of (open) monomers and trimers, respectively.
Porins in -proteobacteria outside the Enterobacteriaceae.
-Proteobacteria are divided into three groups by 16S rRNA
analysis (739). The -3 group contains the Enterobacteriaceae,
vibrios, Haemophilus, ﬂuorescent pseudomonads, and Xan-
thomonas. The ﬂuorescent pseudomonads are characterized by
the absence of genes coding for classical porins, as noted
above. The trimeric porin P2 from H. inﬂuenzae type b has
been extensively characterized in the laboratory of Coulton in
terms of both its exclusion limit (689) and single-channel con-
ductance (688). The OM permeability to cephaloridine, when
calculated from the data given (150), seems to be around 1 to
2 m s1, that is, similar to what was found in E. coli (462).
Recently this porin was found to bind speciﬁcally NAD and
nicotinamide mononucleotide with the half-saturation con-
stant of 4 to 8 mM, apparently an adaptation to the growth
requirement of this organism for nicotinamide nucleotides
(17). This again seems to be an example showing that the
distinction between the general, nonspeciﬁc porins and speciﬁc
channels is far from absolute. A major trimeric porin was
sequenced (234) from an acidophilic, obligate lithotroph, Thio-
bacillus (now Acidithiobacillus [332]) ferrooxidans, which be-
longs to the  branch according to the 16S rRNA sequence
(332). The porin sequence shows a strong similarity to entero-
bacterial porins (Fig. 1). This porin has one of the lowest
single-channel conductance values reported for porins, 30 pS
in KCl (614). Guiliani and Jerez (234) note that in this porin
from an extreme acidophile (with an optimum growth pH of
2.5) the pore-narrowing L3 loop, which contains many more
acidic residues than basic residues in E. coli porins, appears to

be nearly neutral. The structure-function relationship of these
extremophile porins will be an interesting topic for further
study.
The -2 branch is rather distant from the -3 group and
contains only Legionella and related genera. The porin in Le-
gionella pneumophila was identiﬁed, by extraction in the pres-
ence of 2-mercaptoethanol and reconstitution into planar bi-
layer, as a major OM protein of about 28 kDa (212). The
protein could not be extracted in the absence of 2-mercapto-
ethanol, and the native structure of this porin turned out to be
a disulﬁde-linked oligomer (probably a trimer) containing one
subunit that was slightly larger (31 kDa) (275). The two kinds
of subunits turned out to be the same protein, OmpS, but the
31-kDa monomer is larger because it has a fragment of pep-
tidoglycan attached covalently near its C terminus (274). This
covalent attachment to peptidoglycan is unusual, and the se-
quence of this oligomeric porin is not strongly related to that of
any other classical porins (274), a feature consistent with the
phylogenetic distance of Legionella from the -3 group.
A porin from Coxiella burnetii has been puriﬁed, and its
activity was ascertained by the liposome-swelling assay (33).
An unusual feature of this porin is that it dissociated, in the
presence of mercaptoethanol, into subunits of 29.5 and 31 kDa,
both relatively small for classical porins. Since both reacted
with the same monoclonal antibody, they probably were de-
rived from an identical precursor. GenBank contains a recent
entry, AAM03442, which is annotated as the porin sequence
from C. burnetii. This protein, when processed, would indeed
have a rather low molecular weight of 24,500. Interestingly, the
predicted sequence does not contain any cysteine residues, and
mercaptoethanol must therefore contribute to subunit dissoci-
ation by a mechanism other than the reduction of disulﬁde
bonds. Other features of this porin, its small size and the
apparent presence of two types of subunits differing slightly in
molecular weight, are reminiscent of the Legionella porin. C.
burnetii is indeed closely related to Legionella according to
their 16S rRNA sequences (476).
The -1 branch contains some purple sulfur bacteria such as
Chromatium and Ectothiorhodospira. A porin gene from Ecto-
thiorhodospira, a halophilic photosynthetic organism, has been
sequenced, but the sequence does not appear to resemble the
sequence of genes encoding enterobacterial porins (742), again
a reasonable result in view of the distance between the two
branches. Porins from two other species, Ectothiorhodospira
shaposhnikovii and E. vacuolata, were shown to be trimeric,
anion-preferring porins with single-channel conductance val-
ues typical for classical trimeric porins (743).
Porins in -proteobacteria. Comamonas (now Delftia [720];
previously Pseudomonas) acidovorans produces its major trim-
eric porin, Omp32, as a crystalline array in the OM (192). Its
structure was determined by X-ray crystallography (774). It is
a trimeric porin, and the monomer folds as a 16-strand -bar-
rel, as in other classical porins. However, a 6-residue segment
in the middle of the second -strand protrudes into the barrel
lumen and constricts the eyelet region together with the ubiq-
uitous infolding of the L3 loop. Consequently, the opening of
the constricted region is narrower (5 by 7 A˚) than in the E. coli
OmpF porin. Furthermore, there are many basic amino acid
residues (especially arginine) throughout the channel, and
their charges are not neutralized by acidic residues, which are
very few. This feature is consistent with the strong anion se-
lectivity (the ﬂux of Cl was 17 times higher than the ﬂux of K
[405]) of this porin and with the preference of this organism for
organic acids as carbon sources (720). At the constriction zone,
three arginine residues are clustered, yet apparently all of them
remain positively charged. A large factor here is the presence
of a glutamate residue, whose side chain does not protrude
into the channel yet stabilizes the positive charges of the two
arginine residues protruding into the channel (770). Inspection
of three-dimensional structures as well as the primary se-
quences of many porins from - and -proteobacteria suggests
that this arrangement is rather common in the trimeric, clas-
sical porins (770). Omp32 is copuriﬁed and cocrystallized with
a small protein of 54 amino acid residues.
The sequence of Omp32 is similar to the sequences of the
porins of other bacteria belonging to the -proteobacteria,
such as Bordetella pertussis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria
meningitidis,
and
Acidovorax
(previously
Pseudomonas)
delaﬁeldii (220, 303, 774) (Fig. 1). The large excess of basic
amino acids in the channel interior seems to be a common
feature in these porins, on the basis of primary sequence align-
ment (774). This ﬁts with the strong anion selectivity of the
Omp34 porin from A. delaﬁeldii (103). Also, the anion selec-
tivity was already noted in one of the ﬁrst papers describing the
N. gonorrhoeae porin (408). The porin of B. pertussis also pro-
duces an anion-selective channel (22). This protein appears to
occur as a two-dimensional crystalline array in the OM (334,
341). (A crystalline arrangement of a trimeric porin was also
reported from the stalk region of an unidentiﬁed prosthecate
bacterium [121]). Another related porin was reported to be
induced by the virulence regulatory system bvg (206); the func-
tional properties of this porin have not been investigated.
Neisserial porins have been studied extensively, in part due
to their potential use in vaccines. The N. gonorrhoeae porin
gene was ﬁrst cloned and sequenced in 1987 (230). N. menin-
gitidis expresses two porins, PorA and PorB. The porB locus is
occupied in any given strain by either of the two alleles, each
expressing either class 2 or class 3 PorB protein, which are only
60 to 70% identical. The class 3 porin, which has extensive
alterations in the external-loop sequence (including many
short deletions), exhibits the interesting property that its tri-
mers are unusually labile in the presence of SDS even at room
temperature (418), producing monomers that apparently still
retain the -barrel structure but are altered (denatured) in the
loop structure. In this connection, we note that with the OmpF
porin of E. coli, modiﬁcation of loop 2, which connects the
neighboring monomers, can make even this porin susceptible
to SDS-induced dissociation at lower temperatures (493).
Burkholderia cepacia shows strong intrinsic resistance to a
number of antibiotics, and the permeability of its OM to ni-
troceﬁn (a cephalosporin) is an order of magnitude lower than
that in E. coli (483). When the major porin species was iso-
lated, it dissociated into a major 36-kDa species and a minor
27-kDa species on being heated in SDS. The authors speculate
that the active porin is a trimer of the former, a conclusion that
seems to be consistent with a later study from another labora-
tory (229). It produced also a low conductance (0.23 nS) chan-
nel in 1 M KCl (483). The gene coding for the 37-kDa species,
opcP, was cloned; the sequence is most similar to that of the B.
pertussis porin (680).

Interestingly, a 37-kDa OM protein of Vibrio furnissii, which
is induced by the presence of chitooligosaccharides and facil-
itates the speciﬁc diffusion of such oligosaccharides (335),
shows homology to the neisserial porins.
Porins in -proteobacteria. The -proteobacteria have been
divided, by the use of 16S rRNA signature sequences, into
three groups, -1, -2, and -3 (738). The porin for which the
ﬁrst three-dimensional structure was determined by crystallog-
raphy (714, 717, 718) was from Rhodobacter capsulatus, a mem-
ber of the -3 group. The monomer produces a 16-strand
-barrel, which is assembled into a now classical trimer struc-
ture (see “Crystallographic structure of porins” above). In pla-
nar lipid bilayers, the porin produces a high single-channel
conductance of 3.2 nS in 1 M KCl (741), presumably corre-
sponding to the insertion of a trimer with three open channels.
A similar structure was shown for Rhodopseudomonas blastica
(now Rhodobacter blasticus) (351).
The structure of the trimeric porin from Paracoccus denitri-
ﬁcans, also belonging to the -3 branch (531), was reported at
3.1-A˚ resolution (273). Although this organism was earlier
reported to produce a dimeric porin (772), this conclusion was
obviously incorrect, presumably a result of undue reliance on
the mobility of undenatured oligomers in SDS-PAGE. Unlike
Rhodobacter and enterobacterial porins, which contain an ex-
cess of acidic amino acid residues in the channel (although the
eyelet itself has only two acidic residues [Fig. 2C], there are
many more acidic residues on the channel wall, including
Glu62, Asp97, Asp107, Glu296, and Asp312 in OmpF approx-
imately at the same level as the eyelet), and unlike the Omp32
porin, which contains mostly basic residues in the channel, the
P. denitriﬁcans porin channel contains about equal numbers of
acidic and basic residues (273). This is apparently reﬂected in
the ion selectivity of this porin, which is reported to be almost
nonselective or slightly anion selective (581, 582). Isolation of
an oligomeric (most probably trimeric) porin from another
member of the -3 branch, a phototrophic, marine organism,
Roseobacter denitriﬁcans, was reported (441); this porin, like
other trimeric porins from the -3 branch, is dissociated into
monomeric units at low temperature in the presence of EDTA,
apparently a hallmark of porins in this group. An oligomeric
porin from Thiobacillus (now Paracoccus) versutus, with rather
high single-channel conductance, was reported (740).
Besides these organisms, Brucella, which belongs to the -1
branch, appears to be the only organism whose porins were
studied in some detail. Following the demonstration by the
proteoliposome-swelling assay that the Omp2 protein of Bru-
cella abortus forms a channel approximately equal in size to the
E. coli OmpF channel (180), the gene for this protein was
identiﬁed as omp2b (400). Interestingly, there is another ho-
mologous gene, omp2a, located right next to it but read in the
opposite direction. Although Omp2a was apparently not ex-
pressed in B. abortus, it allowed the permeation of a large
tetrasaccharide when expressed in E. coli (400), suggesting that
it produces a larger channel. Indeed, comparison of the se-
quence suggests that Omp2a has a large deletion in the puta-
tive channel-narrowing L3 loop. However, in a planar lipid
bilayer study, Omp2a behaved in a rather anomalous manner,
in contrast to Omp2b, which produced conductance steps ex-
pected for stable, trimeric porins (424). In any case, the juxta-
position of two very homologous genes apparently produces
constant variation in gene sequences via gene conversion
mechanism (482), and the effect of this variation on the phys-
iology and evolution of Brucella species remains an interesting
topic. OM protein IIIa of Rhizobium leguminosarum is homol-
ogous to Brucella porins (128), but no further study of the
Rhizobium porin seems to exist.
Porins in - and -proteobacteria. The -proteobacteria
consists of organisms including myxobacteria, Bdellovibrio, and
some sulfate reducers (476, 737). I am not aware of any de-
tailed studies of the porins from these organisms.
More recently, Campylobacter and Helicobacter were recog-
nized to form another deep branch in the Proteobacteria, with
only very remote relationships to the other four subdivisions
(365, 678); this group is now called the ε-proteobacteria. Be-
cause of the clinical signiﬁcance of these organisms, their por-
ins have been investigated. Campylobacter jejuni produces a
trimeric porin called the major OM protein (MOMP) (79),
with a monomer molecular weight of about 45,000. The tri-
meric structure is unstable and is easily dissociated by SDS
even at room temperature (79). The trimer conformation,
however, has been conﬁrmed in two-dimensional crystalliza-
tion studies (12, 787). Primary sequence analysis utilizing local
hydrophobicity and sequence divergence among isolates sug-
gested the presence of 18, rather than 16, transmembrane
-strands (362, 782), and comparison with speciﬁc channels
LamB and ScrY (described below) showed potential conser-
vation of some short signature motifs (362). On this basis,
MOMP will be a speciﬁc channel rather than a general porin.
However, its high single-channel conductance (0.4 nS per
monomer) (162) is unexpected for a speciﬁc channel. Unfor-
tunately, no further functional study has been carried out on
this protein. Another, slightly larger, putative porin, Omp50,
was identiﬁed in C. jejuni (78). This protein shows a low single-
channel conductance of 50 pS, consistent with a speciﬁc chan-
nel, but no other functional information is available.
Helicobacter pylori, another member of the ε-branch, was
found to produce at least four “heat-modiﬁable” envelope
proteins, a characteristic that is suggestive of the -barrel
structure (196). These proteins (48 to 67 kDa), which are
called HopA, HopB, HopC, and HopD, are related to each
other, and all produced ion channels in planar lipid bilayers. In
a separate study, a 30-kDa protein was suspected of being a
porin (681); indeed, this protein, called HopE, was shown to
produce 1.5-nS channels in 1 M KCl (178). It also appears to
exist as oligomers (most probably as trimers). More than 30
paralogs of this protein were found in H. pylori (663). Analysis
of the HopE sequence and linker insertion experiments sug-
gested that it is a 16-member -barrel (60), but the folding
model, with a small L3 loop and a huge L6 loop, looks very
different from the enterobacterial porins.
Porins in the Planctomyces-Chlamydia group. The MOMP of
Chlamydia trachomatis, an obligate intracellular pathogen, was
suggested to be the porin by liposome-swelling assay (43).
Since then, a somewhat truncated version of the gene (750)
and a full version (309) were cloned and the protein was
expressed in E. coli. The pore-forming activity of this protein
was conﬁrmed by ion conductance after planar bilayer ﬁlm
reconstitution and liposome swelling, respectively. The ge-
nome sequence, however, indicated the existence of another
homolog, porB, and this gene was shown to be a minor porin

(352). Interestingly, PorB appears to prefer, by a wide margin,
intermediates of tricarboxylic acid cycles such as 2-ketogluta-
rate to simple neutral sugars (353). This preference might be
important for Chlamydia, which lives within animal cells.
Porins in the Cytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides group. In
1992, Wexler’s group reported the identiﬁcation of an OmpA-
like major protein from the OM of Bacteroides distasonis, a
protein that showed pore-forming activity in the proteolipo-
some-swelling assay (723). The protein was characterized sub-
sequently (725). More recently, the same group identiﬁed a
heterodimeric protein complex of approximately 200 kDa
(Omp200) from Bacteroides fragilis (722). This complex also
shows porin activity and is thought to be the major porin in this
organism. The genes coding for the subunits (omp121 and
omp71) have been identiﬁed (724). The larger protein appears
to be rich in -strands, and the smaller protein appears more
hydrophobic. This seems to be a porin of a totally new type,
and more studies of its structure and function should be car-
ried out. (OM proteins involved in the degradation of polysac-
charides are discussed in “Speciﬁc channels” below).
Another group noted that -lactam-resistant clinical isolates
of B. fragilis tended to lack a 45-kDa envelope protein and
reported that this protein showed pore-forming activity after
electroelution from SDS-PAGE (472). The relative contribu-
tion of this protein, as well as the OmpA-like protein and
Omp200, to the overall permeability of this organism remains
to be determined. In another study, 51-, 92-, and 125-kDa
proteins were isolated from the B. fragilis OM; although all
proteins were active in pore formation, the speciﬁc activity was
orders of magnitude lower than that of E. coli OmpF (318).
Porins in spirochetes. The Treponema pallidum OM con-
tains an almost 100-fold-lower level of proteins than does the
E. coli OM (525). The identiﬁcation of the major porin in this
organism has therefore been difﬁcult and controversial. One
group has identiﬁed a 31-kDa OM protein, Tromp1, as the
major porin, based primarily on the ability of this protein to
form channels in planar-bilayer assays (70). Another group (8),
however, found that this protein did not produce permeability
on reconstitution into liposomes. The protein lacked the ex-
tensive -structure expected for porins. Furthermore, the pro-
tein sequence was found to be homologous to that of the
solute-binding proteins, and the gene was a part of an operon
coding for components of an ABC transport system. These
results suggest strongly that Tromp1 is a solute-binding pro-
tein, anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane. The ﬁnal proof
of this interpretation came with the solution of the crystal
structures of Tromp1 (or TroA) with or without the ligand,
Zn2 (369, 370), which showed a fold typical of periplasmic
solute-binding proteins rich in -helices. The ﬁrst group pre-
sented a rebuttal, reporting that the urea denaturation of the
protein followed by renaturation through dialysis produced a
trimeric conformer with porin activity (781). However, the
circular dichroism spectrum of the renatured protein showed
no evidence of a predominant -conformation. Furthermore,
the argument of these authors that genes coding for proteins
unrelated to solute-binding activity are sometimes present in
ABC transport operons is incorrect. The authors cite the case
of “adhesins” in gram-positive bacteria, but these are metal-
binding proteins anchored to the plasma membrane, which
also function as adhesins. Although I do not understand why
the protein produces channels, the case for Tromp1 as the
major porin is not convincing at present.
The Borrelia burgdorferi OM showed two kinds of channels,
one small and one large (622). The 25-kDa protein, Oms28,
was shown to produce the channel with the lower conductance
of about 1 nS in 1 M KCl (622). A larger protein, Oms66
(SwissProt accession number Q44841) was shown to produce
channels of very high conductance, about 10 nS (623). In Lep-
tospira, a 31-kDa protein, OmpL1, produces channels with a
conductance of 1 nS and also to form a rather unstable trimer
(605). The C-terminal aromatic amino acid residue (usually
phenylalanine), which characteristically occurs in classical por-
ins of the Enterobacteriaceae (635), does not occur in any of
these spirochetal porins.
Porins in cyanobacteria. Envelopes from cyanobacteria
were shown to produce ion-permeable channels on reconstitu-
tion into planar lipid bilayers (50, 311). The responsible porins
were identiﬁed only fairly recently (252). The proteins travel as
a 140-kDa complex if subjected to SDS-PAGE without heat
denaturation, but they collapse into about 50-kDa monomers if
heated in SDS; this result suggests that they exist as a tight
trimer. On insertion into a planar lipid bilayer, they produce a
single-channel conductance of approximately 0.5 nS in 1 M
KCl. (However the same laboratory reported an order of mag-
nitude higher value of 5 nS earlier [251], and the authors were
unable to give reasons for this difference.) This value has been
compared with the “much higher” single-channel conductance
values of 2 to 3 nS for enterobacterial porins, and it has been
argued that cyanobacteria does not need large channels be-
cause they require, as autotrophs, the uptake of only inorganic
ions (276). However, this comparison unfortunately disregards
the fact that the high “single-channel” conductance values of
enterobacterial porins actually correspond to the insertion of
three open channels of a trimer. Since it is not known whether
the conductance of cyanobacterial porin corresponds to one or
three channels, such an argument seems premature. More
convincing assays, such as liposome swelling, are sorely needed
for cyanobacterial porins.
Determination of the partial amino acid sequence of these
porins led to the realization that one of them was SomA, a
major OM protein identiﬁed earlier (683). There are six ho-
mologs in the genome of Synechocystis strain PCC 6803 (276).
All these proteins are much larger than the classical porins of
the Enterobacteriaceae, and the additional mass exists at the N
terminus as an S-layer homology domain, which is likely to
interact strongly with the peptidoglycan layer (252, 276).
Porins in Fusobacterium. Fusobacterium, a genus of gram-
negative bacteria which seems to be related, surprisingly, to the
gram-positive Corynebacterium-Nocardia-Mycobacterium com-
plex on the basis of 16S rRNA sequence (476), has been stud-
ied in several laboratories because of its potential role as a
periodontal pathogen. An OM protein of about 40 kDa was
identiﬁed as a porin by the liposome-swelling assay and was
shown to exhibit heat modiﬁability (see “Slow porins” above)
(644). The fomA gene was cloned and sequenced, and a 16-
strand -barrel model was proposed mainly on the basis of
comparison of protein sequences from different strains (80), a
procedure that has produced reliable predictions in the past
(452). The predicted pattern is interesting in that loop 3, which
is always large in the classical enterobacterial porins, is small
610

----- Page 19 (native) -----
and, instead, loop 6 is the largest. The protein was shown to
exist as a trimer by cross-linking and to form channels of very
weak ion selectivity (338). Introduction of epitope insertions
and short in-frame deletions conﬁrmed the original folding
model proposed and showed that partial deletion in loop 6
indeed led to the production of channels with much higher
permeation rates for cephalosporins (339, 519). Recent results
(520), however, suggest that the N terminus of this protein is
located in the periplasm and that the -barrel actually contains
14 strands.
Porins in the Deinococcus-Thermus group. A porin of excep-
tionally large apparent size (185 kDa) was found in the Ther-
mus thermophilus OM. This porin is also unusual in producing
a channel of exceptionally high conductivity, 20 nS in 1 M KCl
(394), some 30 times higher than that of E. coli OmpF.
Porin in Thermotoga. Thermotoga maritima, an extremely
thermophilic eubacterium, produces a “sheath” with a crystal-
line array of trimeric proteins with triple indentations (524).
This protein is also porin-like in terms of the high content of
-structure. This protein, called Omp-beta, has since been
shown to produce cation-selective channels in planar bilayers
(191).
Porins
in
the
Corynebacterium-Nocardia-Mycobacterium
group. Bacteria in the Corynebacterium-Nocardia-Mycobacte-
rium group belong to the gram-positive bacteria, yet their pep-
tidoglycan layer is covered by a lipid-rich layer. They produce
long-chain mycolic acids, covalently linked to arabinogalactan,
which in turn is covalently linked to peptidoglycan. Mycolic
acids present in mycobacteria may contain as many as 90 car-
bons and may contain no or very few double bonds. In 1993, it
was shown that the chains of mycolic acids are arranged in a
direction perpendicular to the cell surface (457), and it was
proposed that these bacteria produce, outside the peptidogly-
can layer, an OM-like structure that is composed of an inner
leaﬂet of covalently linked mycolate residues and an outer
leaﬂet of extractable lipids (99). It was further found that the
hydrocarbon domain of this cell wall had exceptionally low
ﬂuidity (381, 382). These observations explain the high intrin-
sic resistance of many mycobacterial species to lipophilic anti-
biotics that are expected to diffuse through the lipid bilayer
regions of the cell wall (301).
Mycobacteria must, however, take up hydrophilic nutrient
molecules. Thus porins were expected to be present. Further-
more, the permeability of the mycobacterial cell wall to hydro-
philic solutes was shown to be quite low: compared with the
permeability of the E. coli OM, it was about 1,000-fold lower in
M. chelonae (302) and about 100-fold lower in M. tuberculosis
(122). Therefore, the property or the amount of the porins
should explain this extremely low permeability.
The ﬁrst report on mycobacterial porins was that of Trias et
al. (670, 673). These workers assayed detergent-solubilized
proteins of the cell wall of M. chelonae for channel formation
in planar bilayers and discovered a fraction that produced a
rather high single-channel conductance of 2.7 nS in 1 M KCl.
The protein appeared to be about 59 kDa on the basis of its
mobility on SDS-PAGE, and the paucity of this protein in the
cell wall appeared to explain the low permeability of the intact
cell wall.
A similar study with M. smegmatis showed the presence of
porins producing 3-nS channels in 1 M NaCl (671). The use of
ions with different radii led to the prediction that the channel
diameter was about 3 nm. When the protein was puriﬁed, it
behaved as though it had a molecular mass of about 100 kDa
in SDS-PAGE (444). (An M. smegmatis porin producing a
large channel was also reported by another laboratory [432].
The N-terminal sequence of this protein is different from that
of MspA [discussed below], and its role in cell wall permeabil-
ity is not clear.) Importantly, heating of the sample in 80%
dimethyl sulfoxide (but not in SDS) resulted in the conversion
of the protein into a 20-kDa band. N-terminal sequencing of
the protein led to the cloning of the mspA gene (444). In a
crucial experiment (630), a deletion of this gene caused a large
(four- to ninefold) decrease in the cell wall permeability, as
assessed by the diffusion of cephaloridine and glucose, a result
indicating that MspA is indeed the major porin for M. smeg-
matis. The permeability did not go to zero. Indeed, the use of
degenerate primers resulted in the identiﬁcation of other close
homologs of MspA in this organism, MspB, MspC, and MspD,
whose sequences are essentially identical to that of MspA
except for the region close to the N terminus (630). In a recent
study (193), Engelhardt et al. showed that the isolated MspA
has a negative-stain-ﬁlled channel of 2.5 nm in diameter and
that such channels were also present on the surface of intact
cell wall. The size is in good agreement with the original esti-
mate of Trias and Benz (671). Furthermore, the native MspA
oligomer was shown, by cross-linking, to be a tetramer, and the
end-on view of the oligomer showed a fourfold symmetry.
Since the length of the channel appeared to be unusually long,
about 10 nm, in the side view, each of the monomers probably
extends for this entire length. This length is consistent with the
thickness of the mycobacterial cell wall, made thicker primarily
because of the extraordinary length of the mycolic acid chains
(99). This length will also slow the diffusion of solutes. The
surface density of the channel appears to be about 50-fold
lower than that of porin channels in the E. coli OM, and both
of these factors are probably sufﬁcient to explain the low per-
meability of the M. smegmatis cell wall. The remarkable sta-
bility of the tetrameric -sheet porin, MspA, which requires
heating to 92 to 112°C for denaturation (even in the presence
of SDS), was described recently (263).
A porin from M. phlei migrates in SDS-PAGE as a 135-kDa
protein, which collapses into a 22-kDa monomer on heating in
dimethyl sulfoxide (547); it is likely that this porin is a homolog
of MspA. Cell wall extracts of M. tuberculosis was shown to
contain porins behaving like MspA, as well as another porin
that produces a much lower single-channel conductance (323).
The situation here seems similar to the coexistence of at least
two porin channels in M. bovis BCG (377).
Studies of porins in other members of the Corynebacterium-
Nocardia-Mycobacterium complex have also been done. Three
species of Nocardia were found to produce porins that had a
large aggregate size (	80 kDa) and formed channels with high
single-channel conductance values (3 to 6 nS) (546, 549, 550).
On heating in SDS, these proteins collapsed into monomers of
approximately 20 kDa (when identiﬁed), and thus the nocar-
dial porins are probably similar to the MspA-type porins of
mycobacteria. C. glutamicum was shown to contain a channel
producing a high single-channel conductance of 6 nS in 1 M
KCl (445). The porin was isolated following its initial extrac-
tion into organic solvents (376). It turned out to be an extraor-

dinarily small protein of only 45 amino acid residues, encoded
by the porA gene, and PorA was conﬁrmed to be the major
porin by deletion of the gene (148). Information about the
three-dimensional structure of this protein is not yet available.
Since corynemycolic acids have much shorter chains (32 to 38
carbons) than mycolic acids, it is perhaps not impossible for
such a small protein to cover the entire thickness of the coryne-
bacterial cell wall, if the MspA model is applicable here. Porins
have been found in the cell wall of Rhodococcus erythropolis
(378) and R. equi (548).
The M. tuberculosis genome contains a homolog of E. coli
OmpA. The product of this gene (OmpAtb) was shown to
generate pores in reconstituted systems (603). Although the
low permeability of OmpA-like porins (see “Slow porins”
above) is attractive in explaining the generally low permeability
of the mycobacterial cell wall, it is rather difﬁcult to imagine
that a protein similar to those that traverse the thickness of E.
coli OM could span the much thicker mycobacterial cell wall. A
deletion mutant containing a mutation of this gene was con-
structed recently (535). It had difﬁculty in growing in acidic
media, and at pH 5.5 the uptake of serine was nearly totally
abolished in the mutant, suggesting that this protein is a major
porin under these conditions.
Putative porins in archaea. Cell envelopes of Haloferax vol-
canii were found to contain ion channels that are mostly open,
showing a behavior resembling that of porin (55). However,
OMs are not known in archaebacteria. The authors speculate
that the region of the envelope hitherto thought to correspond
to “periplasm” may actually be membranous.
Porins and Antibiotic Resistance
The properties of constitutively expressed porins obviously
exert a profound inﬂuence on the intrinsic level of antibiotic
resistance in gram-negative bacteria. Thus, P. aeruginosa (and
most probably other members of the ﬂuorescent pseudo-
monads, although their resistance to antibiotics is rarely as-
sessed) shows a well-known intrinsic resistance to a wide range
of antibiotics, in comparison with the members of the Enter-
obacteriaceae, in large part due to the use of a slow porin,
rather than a classical trimeric porin, as the major channel. The
low-permeability OM becomes even more effective in prevent-
ing the inﬂux of antibiotics, thanks to the synergistic effect of
the multidrug efﬂux complex, which extrudes drugs directly
into the medium (450, 454).
Route of antibiotic inﬂux. In many cases it is not easy to
determine the pathway of inﬂux of antibiotics. Agents that
contain a strong acid group, a quaternary ammonium group, or
multiple charged groups are expected to have difﬁculty in
crossing the bilayer regions of the OM. This is especially so
because the LPS-containing bilayer of the OM shows perme-
ability to lipophilic probes that is about 2 orders of magnitude
lower than that of the conventional phospholipid bilayer mem-
branes (504) (see “Lipid bilayer as a diffusion barrier” below).
As an experimental criterion, one can compare the antibiotic
susceptibility of the wild-type strain with that of an LPS mutant
strain (either a “deep-rough”-type rfa mutant or a leaky lpxA
mutant) (685). Alternatively, one can add polymyxin B non-
apeptide (PMBN) to perturb the LPS-containing bilayer (684).
A greatly increased susceptibility in the mutant or in the
PMBN-treated bacterium indicates strongly that the major
pathway of diffusion is through the OM bilayer. It must be
realized, however, that this change in susceptibility occurs
mainly because the drug inﬂux is counteracted by the active
drug efﬂux; this is clear from the observation that inactivation
of the major multidrug efﬂux pump AcrAB in E. coli produces
drug hypersusceptibility almost exactly like that seen on per-
meabilization of the OM (455). Therefore, the observation of
increased susceptibility is signiﬁcant, but negative results may
not mean much because they could be caused by intrinsically
high inﬂux, poor efﬂux, or both. The same caution must be
exercised in interpreting drug susceptibility data from porin-
deﬁcient mutants. For example, in an ompR mutant of E. coli
in which the expression of both OmpF and OmpC was de-
creased, there was no gross changes in the ﬂuoroquinolone
MICs (497). However, because of the consideration just de-
scribed, these results do not rule out the diffusion of quino-
lones through the porin channels.
It would be ideal if one could measure the ﬂux of drugs
through the porin channels. This is possible for -lactams by
using intact cells or unilamellar liposomes, as mentioned above
(see “Functional assays” in the section “Classical porins”).
Unfortunately, for most other drugs the assay is difﬁcult. The
liposome-swelling assay is easy for uncharged or zwitterionic
agents and possible for monoanionic hydrophilic drugs after
some compromise (461). However, it is currently impossible
for other classes of charged drugs.
If we take the theoretical considerations together with the
experimental data, it is likely that small agents (-lactams,
tetracycline,
chloramphenicol,
and
ﬂuoroquinolones)
use
mainly the porin channels for penetration, at least in the En-
terobacteriaceae, with their high-permeability porins. In con-
trast, large, lipophilic agents, such as macrolides, rifamycins,
novobiocin, and fusidic acid, have difﬁculty in diffusing through
the porin channels, and therefore even the slow diffusion
across the lipid bilayer becomes signiﬁcant.
Aminoglycosides have been proposed to diffuse across the
OM of P. aeruginosa by ﬁrst perturbing the LPS leaﬂet (“self-
promoted uptake”) just like polymyxin does (242, 249). This
hypothesis is discussed below (see “Alterations of the OM
bilayer barrier”).
Resistance caused by loss or modiﬁcation of porins. For
agents that cross the OM via porin channels, a decrease in
porin-mediated permeability may increase the level of resis-
tance. Loss of the porin that produces the largest channel is
predicted to increase resistance to hydrophilic antibiotics, since
these molecules are usually larger than the common nutrients
and are barely able to pass through these channels (for exam-
ple, see reference 765). Examples of increased resistance due
to porin loss are too numerous to mention in an exhaustive
manner, but I will give some early examples here. Mutants with
mutations of the ompF gene are easily selected in E. coli by the
use of bulky, relatively -lactamase-resistant, -lactam com-
pounds (255). One of the earliest examples of porin-deﬁcient
clinical isolates was the report of an S. marcescens strain that
became simultaneously resistant to both aminoglycosides and
-lactams (228). When the broad-spectrum cephalosporins
such as cefotaxime were introduced, it was found that the
derepressed production of -lactamase, accompanied by the
decreased production of porins, produced elevated resistance

most frequently in E. cloacae (111, 721). With E. coli, which
cannot respond to cephalosporins by inducing its chromosoma-
lly encoded -lactamase, the decrease in the production of
porins was the only way to gain resistance (30). A clinical
isolate of S. enterica serovar Typhi showed chloramphenicol
resistance because it could not express the wider-channel
porin, OmpF (665) (undoubtedly with the synergism with the
multidrug efﬂux system [see below]). In another example of a
strain from clinical sources, an S. enterica serovar Typhi-
murium strain originally expressed only OmpC porin and be-
came more resistant by losing its only porin species (412). A
drug-resistant B. cepacia strain with a reduced expression of
porin was reported (23). Several H. inﬂuenzae strains with
reduced levels of porin were more resistant to several antibi-
otics (110).
Several studies reported the alteration of porin patterns in
drug-resistant K. pneumoniae. Loss of porin accompanied by
the production of -lactamase produced cephamycin resis-
tance in vivo in K. pneumoniae (480). This organism normally
expresses OmpK35 (an OmpF homolog) and OmpK36 (an
OmpC homolog). In one study, a clinical isolate did not ex-
press one of the two porins from the beginning but became
more strongly antibiotic resistant after the apparent loss of the
remaining porin (402). OmpK35 may not always play a pre-
dominant role in drug inﬂux, because mutants with single mu-
tations in either OmpK35 or OmpK36, produced in the labo-
ratory, were essentially unaltered in drug susceptibility,
although deletion of both porins increased resistance, as ex-
pected (268). A study using clinical isolates was repeated by the
same investigators (267). In strains that are highly resistant to
bulky
broad-spectrum
cephalosporins,
the
larger-channel
porin, OmpK35, is not usually expressed, leaving behind only
the narrower-channel porin, OmpK36. In some strains, both of
the porins appear to be absent, but these bacteria apparently
survive by expressing, at a low level, a normally quiescent
porin, OmpK37, which produces a channel that is even more
restrictive than OmpK36 (179).
Loss of the major porins, however, is expected to have del-
eterious effects on the survival of the organism in its natural
habitat. More recently, antibiotic-resistant mutants of E. aero-
genes were reported in which the properties of their porins
were altered (395). In a detailed study, alteration of the chan-
nel-constricting loop L3, resulting in the strongly decreased
inﬂux of anionic compounds, was identiﬁed (161). It is likely
that the inﬂux of particular drugs used in therapy (usually
cephalosporins of the most recent “generation” with large sub-
stituents that make the drugs inert to the action of commonly
occurring -lactamases) is drastically decreased without, pre-
sumably, decreasing signiﬁcantly the inﬂux of small, common
nutrients. Detailed comparison of the permeability of these
relevant compounds, however, is not available.
A mutation, penB, in N. gonorrhoeae has been known for a
long time to increase the resistance level to penicillin and
tetracycline, when the strain also has the mtr mutation that
leads to the overexpression of the major multidrug efﬂux sys-
tem, MtrCDE. The penB mutation was also known to be linked
to the porin gene, por. A genetic study by Gill et al. (222)
showed that penB is an allele of por, with alterations in the
channel-constricting loop 3 of the protein, so that two addi-
tional negative charges are introduced into the channel. The
inﬂux rate of penicillin was shown to be drastically reduced in
strains expressing this variant porin.
Imipenem crosses the P. aeruginosa outer membrane pri-
marily through the OprD speciﬁc channel (674) (see “Speciﬁc
channels” below). Mutants with decreased expression of this
protein become predominant easily during imipenem therapy,
since OprD is not important for the uptake of most nutrients.
Martinez-Martinez and coworkers found that growth of P.
aeruginosa in the presence of siliconized latex urinary cathe-
ters, a clinically relevant condition, induces non-hereditary re-
sistance to imipenem (403), an effect now traced to the elution
of zinc, which represses OprD expression (142).
Speciﬁc Channels
Speciﬁc channels catalyze the downhill (spontaneous) diffu-
sion of speciﬁc classes of nutrients. A prototypic member of
this class is the LamB protein, or phage lambda receptor pro-
tein of E. coli, which catalyzes the inﬂux of maltose and higher
oligosaccharides of the maltose series. It may sound strange
that E. coli needs this speciﬁc channel, when the classical
porins OmpF and OmpC allow the ready inﬂux of at least
maltose. However, diffusion rates through the porin channels
are proportional to the concentration difference across the
membrane, and therefore the rates become minuscule when
the external concentration of the solute drops far below the
millimolar level (464). This effect is especially severe for a
fairly large solute such as maltose, which diffuses through the
OmpF porin channel at a rate about 2 orders of magnitude
lower than the diffusion rate of a pentose, arabinose (see Fig.
5 of reference 464). Since starch is degraded primarily to mal-
tose by intestinal amylase, E. coli is thought to need a speciﬁc
channel for this most important carbon source in the natural
habitat. However, more recent studies have shown that LamB
is actually important for the uptake of other sugars as well (see
below).
LamB or maltose channel. Early studies of the LamB chan-
nel, which suggested that the channel favored the diffusion of
maltose and maltodextrins, were discussed in the previous ver-
sion of this review (464). The ﬁrst signiﬁcant advance since
then was the planar lipid bilayer study (53). The single-channel
conductance had a rather low value of 0.16 nS in 1 M KCl.
However, this ion conductance was inhibited by the oligosac-
charides of the maltose series, and this information not only
showed the speciﬁc binding of these ligands to the interior of
the channel but also allowed the determination of their binding
afﬁnity. Expressed as KD values, the afﬁnity ranged from quite
poor (10 mM for maltose) to reasonable (about 60 M for
maltopentaose, hexaose, and heptaose). This approach was
further reﬁned by analysis of the current “noise” that is gen-
erated by the binding and dissociation of sugars (15). The study
showed that there was not much difference among sugars in the
“on” rate but that the “off” rates differed widely from 2,000 s1
for maltotriose to 180 s1 for maltopentaose. More recently,
this line of approach was further reﬁned to the observation of
the transport of individual sugar molecules through a single
channel (355); such studies showed that each of the channels
within a trimer functioned independently and that the entry of
sugar was easier from one end of the channel but that once the
sugar was bound to the interior of the channel, the direction of

its initial entry did not produce any difference in the behavior
of the sugar molecule.
Perhaps the work that had the strongest impact was the
solution of the X-ray crystallographic structure of LamB in
1995 (588) (Fig. 4). Each subunit within the LamB trimer was
shown to contain a -barrel consisting of 18 transmembrane
-strands, in contrast to the 16 found in classical porins. As in
the porins, the external loop L3 folds back into the channel and
causes a constriction, which is much narrower (0.5 to 0.6 nm in
diameter) in LamB. The outer half of the pore is also more
constricted than in the porin channel, owing to the infolding of
the additional loops L1 and L6. In spite of the narrowness of
the channel, the path for maltodextrins could be traced in the
crystal soaked with maltotetraose, since the entire length of the
channel wall is lined with a succession of six aromatic residues,
called the greasy slide, with which the rings in sugar residues
interact (Fig. 4B and C). The interaction between the sugars
and the greasy slide was elucidated in greater detail by soaking
the crystal with maltose, maltotriose, and maltohexaose (188).
Thus the sugars enter in the natural, left-handed helical con-
formation into the channel, with the nonreducing end ﬁrst. The
aromatic residues of the greasy slide are arranged in a helical
manner, and they interact via van der Waals forces with the
less polar side of the sugar rings (Fig. 4C). There is a slight
difference in the helix curvature between the longer maltooli-
gosaccharides and the greasy slide, so that maltohexaose
strongly interacts only with the central three aromatic residues
of the slide. Especially at the constriction region, there are also
many charged residues that are predicted to form hydrogen
bonds with the hydroxyl groups of the sugars (188); the role of
these “polar tracks” was conﬁrmed by site-directed mutagen-
esis (186). Finally, soaking of the crystal with sucrose, treha-
lose, and melibiose showed that the last two could bind to the
greasy slide and could be transported, although the interaction
at any given time would involve only one sugar unit of the
disaccharide (709). With sucrose, on the other hand, the fruc-
tose residue prevents the entry of the sugar into the constricted
region of the channel and hence prevents its translocation.
These results are in complete agreement with the liposome-
swelling study showing that LamB allowed the diffusion of
trehalose and melibiose but not sucrose (388). The structure of
the greasy slide also predicts that LamB will catalyze the dif-
fusion of glucose, and an in vitro reconstitution conﬁrmed this
prediction (388). It is interesting in this connection that a
chemostat study showed that under carbohydrate-limited con-
ditions, LamB production by E. coli became strongly dere-
pressed and that the presence of LamB conferred advantages
to growth at limiting concentrations of not only glucose but
also lactose, arabinose, and even glycerol (164). Thus, the
LamB channel is not really a maltose-speciﬁc channel (or mal-
toporin), but its function in E. coli physiology is to facilitate the
inﬂux of a wide variety of carbohydrates when they exist in low
concentrations in the environment.
ScrY or sucrose channel. A speciﬁc channel that is homol-
ogous to LamB (25% identity at the amino acid level), ScrY, is
encoded by a plasmid that allows some strains of E. coli and
Salmonella to utilize sucrose as a carbon source (256). This
channel allows the rapid diffusion of a large variety of sugars,
such as glucose, fructose, arabinose, maltose, lactose, rafﬁnose,
and maltodextrins, in addition to sucrose (13, 256, 591, 595).
The N-terminal segment of ScrY, about 70 residues long, has
no equivalent part in LamB, and in the crystal structure of
FIG. 4. X-ray crystallographic structure of LamB. (A) Side view of the monomeric unit. The -barrel contains 18 strands in this protein, in
contrast to the 16 strands seen in the trimeric porins. In addition to loop 3 (orange), loop 1 (red) folds deeply into the channel. Loop 2 (blue) folds
outward and interacts with the neighboring subunit in the trimer, as in OmpF (Fig. 2A). Other loops also are often large and tend to cover the
entrance of the channel from the outside. (B) View of the monomeric unit from the top. The greasy slides (Tyr41, Tyr6, Trp420, Trp358, and

ScrY this portion was disordered. The structure of the C-
terminal 413-residue portion of this protein (208) provides an
interesting contrast to that of LamB. As in LamB, the protein
forms a trimer, each subunit consisting of an 18-stranded
-barrel. The channel is constricted by the infolding of loop 3,
but the constriction is signiﬁcantly wider (0.85 by 1.1 nm) than
in LamB. The channel contains a greasy-slide structure very
similar to that in LamB. Sucrose, however, was seen to interact
with the aromatic residues of the slide only through the pyra-
nose ring of the glucosyl residue; the fructosyl residue pointed
away into the lumen of the channel. Furthermore, the residues
in LamB that stick out into the lumen and prevent the diffusion
of the bent sucrose molecules are absent in ScrY. In fact,
conversion of Asp201 of ScrY into Tyr, to produce a constric-
tion structure resembling that in LamB, prevented the diffu-
sion of sucrose without impairing that of maltose (682). In a
converse experiment, changing the residues that present ob-
struction to sucrose permeation in LamB, Arg109 and Tyr118,
into alanine produced a mutant channel that now allowed
sucrose to enter (694).
The function of the N-terminal 70-residue extension in ScrY
is somewhat controversial. When this extension was deleted,
there was not much change in the binding of various sugars to
the channel, but the diffusion of maltopentaose was greatly
enhanced in intact cells for unexplained reasons (596). In a
more recent study (185), the peptide comprising this domain
was shown to form a parallel, three-stranded coiled coil, which
was shown to bind to sucrose in equilibrium dialysis with an
afﬁnity 2 orders of magnitude higher than the binding to the
greasy slide within the channel. (The binding of sucrose to this
peptide was also observed by NMR [415].) This appeared to
support the idea that the N-terminal extension forms an ex-
tension of the greasy slide to facilitate the movement of su-
crose into the periplasm. When the N-terminal sequence was
added to LamB, the diffusion of higher maltodextrins was
greatly enhanced, a result that is not inconsistent with the idea
of the periplasmic extension of the transport pathway. The
authors argue that such an extension may not be needed for
LamB in intact E. coli cells because maltodextrins will be
captured immediately by the periplasmic maltose-binding pro-
tein. However, these data do not ﬁt well with the better trans-
port of maltopentaose by the N-terminus-truncated version of
ScrY.
“BglH,” an aryl--D-glucoside channel. A gene immediately
downstream from the bglGFB operon, yieC, was found to code
for a sequence homologous to LamB (708). It was thought to
be a part of the operon that functions in the degradation of
aryl--glucosides in E. coli and was named bglH and overex-
pressed (18). The BglH protein (58 kDa) was a trimeric OM
protein, and when inserted into the planar lipid bilayer it pro-
duced ion channels that were blocked most effectively by aryl-
-glucosides such as arbutin (4-hydroxyphenyl--glucoside) or
salicin (2-hydroxymethylphenyl--glucoside), with an apparent
KD values of 1 to 3 mM (18). The protein showed strong
sequence similarity to both LamB and ScrY.
Other speciﬁc channels. The role of E. coli Tsx (receptor of
phage T6[six]) protein in nucleoside transport has been known
since the 1970s (253). The expression of the tsx gene is in-
creased in the presence of nucleosides through the action of
the DeoR and CytR repressors (98). This relatively small pro-
tein (31.4 kDa) has been puriﬁed and shown to produce chan-
nels that can be blocked by nucleosides (393). Comparison of
sequences of homologs from other members of Enterobacteri-
aceae conﬁrms a 14-strand -barrel structure (447). Interest-
ingly, loop 3, which is normally very large in classical porins, is
minute here and loops 6 and 7 are relatively large. The Tsx
channel functions in the uptake of an antibiotic albicidin, and
albicidin-resistant mutants contain alterations in this protein
(61). Identiﬁcation of mutational alterations showed that res-
idues close to the loop-barrel junctions in loops 1, 6, and 7 are
important in substrate recognition (211). As far as I am aware,
Tsx is not known to form stable oligomers, and this fact, to-
gether with its small size, makes Tsx very different from LamB
or ScrY and somewhat reminiscent of OmpG (discussed in
“Other porins in E. coli and Salmonella” above) and CymA
(see below).
The CymA protein of Klebsiella oxytoca was identiﬁed as a
product of a large cluster of cyclodextrin utilization genes
(205). It is a relatively small protein (322 residues) and seems
to exist as monomers (479). However, the channel in this
protein binds cyclodextrins at high afﬁnity, as judged from the
KS of 28 M for the blocking of the ion conductance produced
by this protein. Several features of this protein, including the
presence of the gene within a large cluster of oligosaccharide
utilization genes, its monomeric nature, and its relatively small
size, are reminiscent of Tsx and OmpG of E. coli described
above.
FadL of E. coli, a somewhat larger protein (46.0 kDa), was
identiﬁed as an OM channel necessary for the efﬁcient utiliza-
tion of long-chain fatty acids as a carbon source (66, 68). This
protein, which apparently exists as monomers (67), binds its
substrates with an afﬁnity that is extraordinary among speciﬁc
OM channels (for example, the KD for oleate is 2 
 107 M)
(360). A 20-strand -barrel structure has been proposed (156).
Mutagenesis experiments showed that residues close to the C
terminus are important in substrate binding (360). However,
long-chain alcohol cannot displace the bound fatty acids, and
this suggests that the carboxyl group of fatty acids also plays a
role in binding. A search for basic amino acid residues involved
in binding led to the identiﬁcation of His110 as an important
factor in the process (69). Interestingly, homologs apparently
facilitating the diffusion of aromatic compounds have recently
been identiﬁed. These include the TbuX toluene channel in
Ralstonia picketii (313), the m-xylene channel XylN encoded by
the TOL plasmid pWW0 of P. putida (324), the putative salic-
ylate ester channel SalD of Acinetobacter (310), the putative
p-cymene channel CymD of P. putida (189), and the putative
cumene channel CumH of P. ﬂuorescens (241).
Recently, a study of a small (236-residue) OM protein,
KdgM, of Erwinia chrysanthemi was published (75). This pro-
tein acted as oligogalacturonate channel in intact cells, and its
conductance in planar lipid bilayer assay was inhibited by the
addition of oligogalacturonates. There was no evidence that
this small protein formed an oligomer. Experimental evidence
shows that KdgM produces a 14-strand -barrel and that loop
6, rather than loop 3, may cause constriction of the channel
(490).

meability classical porins (see “Slow porins” above), appear to
be especially rich in these proteins, which are presumably
needed for the uptake of various nutrients. A recent analysis of
the P. aeruginosa genome (244) suggests that for the OprD
family alone, there are 19 members in this organism.
One P. aeruginosa OM protein, OprB (earlier called
OprD1), was assumed to be a speciﬁc channel for glucose (for
references, see reference 464). Detailed study with various
sugars showed that although OprB allowed the slow, nonspe-
ciﬁc penetration of solutes of 300 Da, it signiﬁcantly accel-
erated the diffusion of D-glucose and D-xylose (676). Structure
prediction by using LamB as a model showed that a similar
greasy slide with aromatic residues may exist in this protein.
Mutants lacking this protein were shown to be reduced in their
capacity to utilize several monosaccharides (749). By using the
oprB promoter fusion plasmid, it was conﬁrmed that glucose
was the most effective inducer of OprB (6). Acidic pH pro-
duced a strong additional increase in oprB transcription, but
bacteria grown at acidic pH on glucose paradoxically took up
glucose more slowly than did those grown at pH 7. Unfortu-
nately, the authors did not study the effect of pH on the
channel properties of OprB, and thus the results remain rather
confusing. The P. aeruginosa genome contains one close and
one distant relative of the oprB gene (244).
OprD (earlier called OprD2), a protein of 45.9 kDa, came to
attention because imipenem-resistant mutants of P. aeruginosa
were found to lack it (523). Such mutants were indeed defec-
tive in the permeation of imipenem across the OM (672), and
liposome-swelling studies with puriﬁed OprD showed that this
protein allowed a much faster diffusion of imipenem than
expected from its molecular mass (674). Finally, the OprD
channel was shown to facilitate the diffusion of basic amino
acids and peptides, and imipenem was proposed to mimic
these compounds (675). Expression of OprD is speciﬁcally
induced by arginine via the arginine repressor ArgR (471).
One laboratory claimed that OprD was the main nonspeciﬁc
porin of P. aeruginosa (763). The ﬁnding of extremely low
single-channel conductance (20 pS in 1 M KCl) was incompat-
ible with this notion, and this laboratory emphasized the oc-
casional conductance steps that were much larger (	400 pS)
(288). However, the smaller conductance steps are clogged by
micromolar concentrations of imipenem and thus represent
the imipenem-conducting pathway (279). If OprD is a speciﬁc
channel, the size of the conductance for inorganic ions, which
are not the substrates for the channel, is expected to be small.
Therefore, these results suggest that OprD behaves as a spe-
ciﬁc channel, contrary to the claim.
Analysis of the primary sequence of OprD suggested that it
could be modeled as a homolog of E. coli OmpF-OmpC (280).
It is interesting that in addition to loops 2 and 3, the OprD
model has a large loop 7, and that deletion of many of the
external loops was shown to affect the permeability of the
channel (280). Eight-residue deletions in loops 2 and 3 were
found to produce proteins with channels that not only are
incapable of facilitating the diffusion of imipenem but also are
not blocked by added imipenem (279, 470).
OprD was reported to exist as a trimer in nonionic deter-
gents (764). This oligomeric structure, however, is said to be
dissociated by all of the ionic detergents tried, including such
mild and nondenaturing detergents as cholate and deoxy-
cholate. OprD appeared monomeric when the OM was solu-
bilized in SDS at low temperature (245). It was claimed to be
a protease (762). However, the kcat reported was insigniﬁcant
(about 105 s1), indicating that one cleavage occurs after tens
of generations of the bacterium; clearly, this does not have any
physiological relevance. A recent review (244) indicated that
there are many homologs of OprD in the P. aeruginosa ge-
nome, as stated above, and that those more closely related to
OprD play roles in amino acid or peptide transport. However,
I am not aware of any functional studies of proteins other than
OprD in this family. An interesting homolog of OprD, PhaK of
P. putida, is involved in the inﬂux of phenylacetic acid, a carbon
source for this organism (475), a result suggesting that many
homologs of OprD in P. aeruginosa are likely to be speciﬁc
channels for a wide range of nutrients.
OprE (earlier named protein E1) was found to be decreased
in some P. aeruginosa mutants resistant to cephalosporins car-
rying double negative charges (752) and was thus thought to be
a speciﬁc channel. It was then cloned and sequenced (751).
OprE appears to be a homolog of OprD. OprE was induced
when P. aeruginosa was grown anaerobically with nitrate as the
electron acceptor.
P. aeruginosa also produces protein E2 (formerly protein E).
The level of this protein was found to be decreased in a mutant
showing a wide range of increased resistance to cephalosporins
and ﬂuoroquinolones (752). Otherwise, its properties are not
known (244).
OprP of P. aeruginosa was ﬁrst identiﬁed as an OM protein
induced under phosphate starvation conditions (248). Unlike
E. coli PhoE, which is a general porin with an anion prefer-
ence, OprP appears to be a true speciﬁc channel since it has a
much higher afﬁnity for phosphate than for other anions (243).
The gene was sequenced (612), and the signiﬁcance of various
lysine residues in the protein was assessed by site-directed
mutagenesis (641). Epitope insertion mutagenesis gave results
compatible with a 16-strand -barrel model (640).
OprO, a 45.3-kDa protein of P. aeruginosa, was identiﬁed as
a pyrophosphate-selective channel (247). It is a trimeric porin
like OprP, and its sequence is 76% identical to that of OprP. It
shows a low single-channel conductance of 0.26 nS in 1 M KCl
(613).
A methylotroph (an organism that can grow on one-carbon
compounds such as methanol or formamide), Methylophilus
methylotrophus, was found to contain an fmdC gene in its
formamide utilization gene cluster (416). The FmdC protein
(39 kDa) is induced by formamide, acetamide, and urea and is
hypothesized to form a speciﬁc channel for these compounds,
but experimental evidence is still lacking. The sequence of
FmdC is not similar to that of any other OM proteins studied.
TonB-Dependent Receptors or Gated Channels
Siderophores (iron chelators of microbial origin) and vita-
min B12 are too large to pass through the classical porin chan-
nels of E. coli, and it would be difﬁcult to design speciﬁc
channels for them without making them nonspeciﬁcally per-
meable to many large solutes, thus compromising the bacterial
resistance to environmental toxic compounds. These com-
pounds are transported by utilizing TonB-dependent receptors
in the OM. Examples of such receptors in E. coli K-12 include

BtuB for vitamin B12 and six receptors for Fe3-siderophore
complexes (FepA for Fe3 enterobactin, FhuA for fer-
richrome, FecA for Fe3 citrate, FhuE for Fe3 coprogen, and
Cir and Fiu for Fe3 catecholates and Fe3 dihydroxybenzoyl-
serine [95]). (A recent addition to the list of siderophore re-
ceptors in S. enterica and enteropathogenic E. coli is IroN,
which transports Fe3 salmochelin [254].) These receptors
bind to the ligands with high afﬁnity (submicromolar or even
nanomolar Kd), and their function requires an interaction with
the protein TonB, which is thought by some workers to span
the thickness of periplasm (425). The action of TonB requires
that the cytoplasmic membrane is energized and that the en-
ergy derived from the proton motive force is somehow trans-
ferred to the receptors with the assistance of two cytoplasmic
membrane proteins, ExbB and ExbD (94, 271, 425) (Fig. 5), so
that an active transport results across the OM (505). At least
for vitamin B12, evidence has been presented that the periplas-
mic concentration can far exceed the external concentration
(543).
That the receptor functions as a gated channel was demon-
strated by Rutz et al. (567). These workers hypothesized that
the receptor for ferric enterobactin, FepA, folds as a 29-strand
-barrel and deleted large internal segments. Some of these
deletion mutant proteins not only allowed the passive diffusion
of enterobactin but also apparently functioned as large, open
channels through which relatively large antibiotics could pen-
etrate. These results led to the hypothesis that the surface
loops of this -barrel acted to close the large diffusion channel.
When the crystal structures of several siderophore receptors,
FepA (106), ferrichrome receptor FhuA (202, 385), ferric ci-
trate receptor FecA (200), and, most recently, the vitamin B12
receptor BtuB (133), were solved, the overall structure of these
receptors was found to be quite different from what was antic-
ipated by Rutz et al. (567). (Crystallographic structures of
various receptors have recently been reviewed [201].) The un-
liganded and liganded structures of FecA are shown in Fig. 6.
The -barrel in all these monomeric receptor proteins is com-
posed of only 22 strands, and the N-terminal portion, consist-
ing of about 150 to 200 residues, is found as a globular domain
that is inserted into the barrel from the periplasmic side, form-
ing a “plug” or “cork.” Some of these receptors were crystal-
lized with and without ligands. The ligands bind to a site that
is close to the external entrance of the barrel and is composed
of both plug and barrel sequences (Fig. 6B). It was gratifying to
see that ligand binding resulted in the propagation of confor-
mational changes within the plug, so that the most N-terminal
portion containing a short motif (TonB box) (shown in light
blue in Fig. 6A), which was shown to interact with the TonB on
the basis of its disulﬁde cross-linking with BtuB (113) and,
FIG. 5. Hypothetical models of the ExbBD-TonB (left) and
TolQR-TolB-PAL (right) systems. As seen, most proteins in these two
systems are similar in their membrane topology, except for the
periplasmic protein To1B and the OM lipoprotein PAL, which do not
have counterparts in the Ton system. TonB is drawn as though it will
interact directly with the OM receptors while still associated with the
inner membrane (IM). However, this may be an oversimpliﬁcation,
and there are pieces of evidence that favor the shuttling of TonB
between the OM and the inner membrane (372).

conformational changes, with the loss of part of the helical structure in loop 7. The diagrams are based on PDB ﬁles 1KMO and 1KMP.

more recently, with FecA (474), appears to undergo a large
conformational change. Interestingly, conversion of some res-
idues of the TonB box of BtuB into proline or glycine nearly
abolishes the transport activity without impairing the binding
of the ligand (112). Mutagenesis of various residues of the
TonB box into cysteine, followed by labeling with a spin label,
showed that some of these residues are immobile, presumably
because they are docked within the -barrel. When the ligand,
vitamin B12, binds to BtuB, all of the residues become mobile,
a result thought at that time to be due to the release of the
N-terminal sequence of the protein, containing this box, into
the periplasm, so that the box sequence could interact with
TonB (138). These conclusions were also consistent with the
site-directed labeling of residues in the N-terminal domain of
BtuB (198, 414). Recently, the crystallization of unliganded
and liganded BtuB (133) showed for the ﬁrst time the details of
the conformational change in the TonB box on ligand binding.
The TonB box does not become extruded into the periplasm,
but there is a ﬂipping of a portion of the box. The interaction
of TonB with the receptors was recently reviewed by Postle and
Kadner (506).
These results explain the sequence of events up to the bind-
ing of ligands and the conformational alteration of the Ton box
so that it can now interact with TonB. However, inspection of
structures with and without the ligand shows no massive move-
ment of the plug domain relative to the barrel to create a large
channel that may be necessary for the inﬂux of the ligands
(385). Two lines of evidence suggest that the next stage of
transport is initiated by the movement of external loops. First,
the structures of FecA with and without ferric citrate showed
that the ligand binding causes extensive movement of some of
the loops, so that the high-afﬁnity binding site now becomes
shielded from the external medium (200) (Fig. 6). Although
this movement itself does not create a large channel, it can be
viewed as the ﬁrst step, which may then be followed by a
large-scale conformational change caused by the energized
TonB. Second, chemical cross-linking of Lys483 (close to the
tip of L7) in FepA to the neighboring OmpA and OmpF
proteins becomes impossible on binding of the ligand, enter-
obactin (600); this shows that the loops come together and
close the top of the FepA protein on ligand binding, as shown
crystallographically with FecA (200). (Conformational alter-
ation in surface loops on ligand binding is also suggested by
site-speciﬁc ﬂuorescence labeling [115].) Currently, the urgent
question in this area is to understand the nature of the ex-
pected TonB-dependent conformational alterations of the re-
ceptors. In this connection, it is interesting that the spin label
at residue 280 of FepA, now known to be near the base of L3,
showed large TonB-dependent changes in mobility during en-
terobactin transport in intact cells (306). ExbB and ExbD are
related to MotA and MotB, respectively (346; see also refer-
ence 94), which are thought to form a stator in the ﬂagellar
motor; this homology suggests that perhaps the proton ﬂux
through the interface between ExbB and ExbD may generate a
rotation or conformational change of another protein, such as
TonB. A hypothetical model of the proton pathway through
the ExbB-ExbD-TonB complex has been proposed (779).
A surprising observation, in view of the general consensus
about the role of the TonB box, was that the deletion of the
entire “plug” from FhuA still produced a TonB-dependent
transport of ferrichrome (92, 336). (A much earlier study of the
deletion between residues 21 and 128 showed a similar, unim-
paired transport phenotype [116], but the mutant protein still
contained the Ton box.) Thus, the -barrel domain alone of
FhuA is still capable of energy-dependent transport and many
other functions of this protein described in the references
cited. The structure of wild-type FhuA suggests that deletion of
the plug would produce a wide-open channel. However, the
deletion made E. coli only very slightly more susceptible to
various antibiotics (92), and the mutant protein did not pro-
duce stable channels after reconstitution into planar lipid bi-
layers (93). These observations suggest that the channel might
be still closed by the external loops. Indeed, deletion of part of
the L4 loop (or the region from the end of the L4 loop and the
external half of -strand 8 that protrudes out from the surface
of the OM), when combined with the plug deletion, leads to a
protein producing large, stable channels (93). The movement
of the external loops accompanying ligand binding is described
above.
The utilization of polysaccharides by Bacteroides has been
studied in the laboratory of A. A. Salyers. Unlike many bac-
teria, which degrade polymers in the external medium by se-
creting enzymes, Bacteroides appears to contain polysaccha-
FIG. 7. Major export pathways of proteins across the OM. Com-
ponents of type I, type II, and type III secretion pathways are shown
schematically. The type I pathway is composed of an ABC transporter
(here HlyB for E. coli hemolysin), a membrane fusion protein (MFP)
family protein (HlyD), and an OM channel (TolC). In the type II
pathway, the proteins reach the periplasmic space via the Sec pathway
and are then secreted across the OM by a machinery with many
components, including pilin-like proteins (pseudopilins). The proteins
are labeled according to the universal Gsp (general secretory pathway)
nomenclature, and the scheme owes most to a recent review by Tha-
nassi (652). The energy is apparently supplied by ATP hydrolysis by the
GspE protein. The type III system is involved in the secretion (or
perhaps injection) of virulence-related proteins into animal and plant
host cells. Many of the components have homologies to the proteins of
the ﬂagellar hook and basal plate system. The ﬁgure is based mainly on
a recent proposal that relies heavily on this similarity (73), as well as
experimental studies of the “needle complex” (354, 648). The names of
the proteins are those from the type III pathway in S. enterica serovar
Typhimurium, with those from that of Y. enterocolitica shown in pa-
rentheses. The energy for export is thought to be supplied by the InvC
(YscN) ATPase. IM, inner membrane.

ride-degrading enzymes within the cells, probably in the
periplasm (573), or associated with the envelope (609). Thus,
polysaccharides, or at least their large degradation products,
must be transported across the outer membrane. A large OM
protein of 1,065 residues, CsuF, which is essential for growth of
B. thetaiotaomicron on chondroitin sulfate and which binds this
polysaccharide, was discovered in 1995 (127). Its N terminus,
about a 60-residue domain, had a striking similarity to the
similar region of TonB-dependent receptors of E. coli (127),
now known to correspond to the plug domain. A close ho-
molog of CsuF, SusC (again a large protein [115 kDa]), is
encoded by an operon for starch utilization, is necessary for
growth on starch, is located in the OM, and binds starch (536).
Furthermore, my analysis of the CsuF and SusC sequences
with the program PSI-BLAST (11) shows that these proteins
belong to the family of TonB-dependent receptors. Therefore,
it is likely that CsuF and SusC are also energy-dependent
transporters utilizing a TonB homolog, although little evidence
is available for their precise mechanisms of action. SusC ap-
parently forms a complex with another OM protein, SusD
(134).
Export Channels of the TolC Family
The OM is expected to act as a major barrier when proteins
have to be exported out of gram-negative cells. Currently at
least ﬁve different mechanisms are known to be utilized to
overcome this barrier, and three of them are schematically
shown in Fig. 7. In the type I machinery, the protein is exported
in a single step through a multisubunit export assembly that
does not depend on the conventional Sec pathway. The type I
pathways export, for example, hemolysin and colicin V in E.
coli, metalloprotease in E. chrysanthemi, alkaline protease in P.
aeruginosa, and cyclolysin in B. pertussis (706). Type I export
assembly is composed of an ABC-type transporter in the cyto-
plasmic membrane, a periplasmic helper protein now classiﬁed
as the membrane fusion protein (175), and an OM channel,
now known to comprise a family (14), called OM factor (OMF)
(757). In E. coli, a single OMF protein, TolC, functions in the
export of various proteins (707); in contrast, in other species of
bacteria, the three component proteins of any given type I
system tend to be located on the same operon, resulting in the
requirement of a speciﬁc OMF for a speciﬁc substrate protein
(14).
One of the ﬁrst protein export complexes of this type studied
was that for the export of hemolysin in E. coli, an assembly
containing the HlyB exporter (an ABC transporter), the HlyD
periplasmic protein, and the OM channel TolC (706, 707) (Fig.
7). More recently, exporters of a very wide range of small
molecules, ranging from solvents and dyes to most amphiphilic
and lipophilic antibiotics, were also shown to be constructed as
a tripartite complex that also contained members of the OMF
family. A major multidrug efﬂux transport complex of E. coli is
thus composed of the AcrB antiporter protein, the AcrA
periplasmic protein of the membrane fusion protein family,
and, again, the TolC OM channel (450). Similarly, the major
multidrug efﬂux pump of P. aeruginosa is composed of the
MexB antiporter, the MexA periplasmic protein, and the
OprM OM channel, and there are now many more examples
(for reviews, see references 448 and 450). The P. aeruginosa
genome codes for 18 homologs of OprM, and the function of
some of the members in drug efﬂux is beginning to be identi-
ﬁed (307).
Some information is available about the interaction between
the components of these systems. Using an afﬁnity matrix that
binds the protein substrates of the type I secretion machinery
of E. chrysanthemi, the protein substrates were shown to bind
to the ABC transporter ﬁrst, which then forms a complex with
the periplasmic component and ﬁnally forms a complex with
the OM channel protein (373). More recently, chemical cross-
linking in intact cells showed that HlyB and a trimer of HlyD
form a complex in the absence of substrate and TolC but that
the formation of the complex containing a trimeric TolC re-
quired the presence of the substrate (651). Similar cross-link-
ing experiments showed that the AcrB antiporter forms a com-
plex with a trimer of the periplasmic protein AcrA even in the
absence of TolC (777), and AcrA was shown to be a highly
elongated protein (up to 20 nm long) (26, 775). Finally, the
crystal structure of the AcrB transporter was elucidated (434),
revealing a homotrimeric protein with huge periplasmic do-
mains. The structure of AcrB with bound drugs, elucidated
recently (769), suggests the way in which drugs become cap-
tured by this pump of extraordinary wide speciﬁcity (768). The
molecular details about how these proteins interact and form
an export complex, however, are not clear.
An important discovery has been the solution of the crystal
structure of the TolC trimer (348). The trimer was found to
consist of two barrel-like structures joined together (Fig. 8A).
At one end is a -barrel structure that is typical of OM pro-
teins, such as porins, speciﬁc channels, and high-afﬁnity sid-
erophore receptors. The interior of the 12-strand -barrel,
however, is not constricted or obstructed in any way by the
infolding of loops and thus has a wide diameter (up to 3.5 nm).
Furthermore, a single barrel is made of three monomeric units,
each contributing four -strands. This barrel is connected to a
long (about 100-A˚) -tunnel structure consisting essentially of
12 -helices. The -tunnel contains an internal cavity, which
has a diameter in the range of 20 A˚ in the part close to the
-barrel but is closed at the end facing the cytoplasmic mem-
brane. This is because of the way in which neighboring helices
interact as a coiled coil (607). However, unlike the rigid -bar-
rel structure, the -tunnel can be opened up widely (by 30 A˚)
by a small uncoiling movement of the component -helices
(348, 607), and this dynamic nature of the -tunnel is likely to
have important implications for how the protein functions. It is
not known what causes the tunnel opening—one proposal is
that the periplasmic proteins, such as AcrA or HlyD, which
themselves contain a coiled-coil structure (308, 499), may in-
teract with the -tunnel domain of TolC, stabilizing the inher-
ently unstable open conformation of this tunnel (607). In any
case, it is intriguing that the outer end of the periplasmic
domain of the AcrB trimer seems to ﬁt nicely to the inner end
of the -tunnel domain of TolC (434). Recently, TolC in S.
enterica serovar Typhimurium was shown to allow some inﬂux
of methyl viologen from the external medium (577); this may
not be totally surprising because the closure of the end of the
-tunnel is thought to be a dynamic phenomenon.
OprM, one of the TolC homologs of P. aeruginosa, was
studied by creating short deletions within the gene (375).
Those that prevented protein expression occurred mostly in

the region predicted to be in the -tunnel domain in the TolC
structure, a result that ﬁts with the importance of this domain
in the overall folding of the trimer. A similar result was re-
ported from another laboratory on the basis of both insertion
and deletion mutations (745). The surface accessibility of in-
serted epitopes of the same series of mutants, however, re-
sulted in a different, porin-like folding model in an earlier
study (746); these results appear to remain unexplained in the
newer study.
Secretins, Ushers, and Autotransporters Producing
Oligomeric Rings
Secretins. Many proteins are secreted by gram-negative bac-
teria via the type II secretion pathway or the main terminal
branch of the general secretory pathway (515, 516), where they
are ﬁrst secreted into the periplasm by the Sec-dependent
process and then cross the OM by a process requiring many
components (Fig. 7). The more intensively studied examples
include the Pul (pullulanase) system of K. oxytoca, the Out
system of E. chrysanthemi, which secretes pectate lyase and
other enzymes; and the Xcp system of P. aeruginosa, which
secretes toxin A and various enzymes (564, 576). The features
of these systems include the large number (14 or more) of
protein components required for secretion and the observation
that the secreted protein apparently folds into its mature con-
formation in the periplasm (517). From the early days, PulD
and its homologs (or GspD in the universal nomenclature and
also in Fig. 7), among these large number of exporter compo-
nents, were thought to form channels of some kind across the
OM, where they are located (516). Based on the knowledge
(219) that protein pIV of ﬁlamentous phage f1, a protein that
is located in the OM and is essential for the extrusion of the
6.5-nm wide phage into the environment, is homologous to
PulD and its homologs in the type II secretion system (and also
to the OM component of type III secretion systems [see be-

manner, as a trimeric -helix. The structure rich in -helix, surrounding the upper middle part of the needle, is the lysozyme domain, which is
thought to play a role in puncturing a hole in the peptidoglycan. The domain at the very top interacts with another protein, gp27, which was omitted

low]), Russel proposed the seminal idea (565, 566) that oli-
gomers of these proteins may form OM channels for export of
proteins and ﬁlamentous phages. (Recent reviews [652, 654]
summarize our current knowledge of these OM channels.)
Furthermore, this group showed that pIV occurs as multimers
composed of 10 to 12 subunits (331), an observation suggesting
that pIV homologs function by forming a ring-like oligomeric
complex, which was soon visualized by electron microscopy
(379). PulD and its homologs (or GspDs) in type II secretion
systems, often called secretins, were also later shown to occur
as oligomeric complexes containing 12 to 14 subunits (64, 257,
466). (Secretins of P. aeruginosa have been reviewed [63].)
Homologs of PulD and pIV are also involved in the extrusion
of type IV pili, and one such component, PilQ, was also shown
to form an oligomer (64). A recent study presents the descrip-
tion of the ring structure of PilQ from N. meningitidis (141).
The C-terminal halves of various secretins show strong sim-
ilarity and were predicted to contain 10 to 13 -strands (64,
235). In agreement with the hypothesis that the N-terminal
halves reside in the periplasm and the C-terminal halves cross
the membrane, limited protease digestion of PulD (467) and P.
aeruginosa XcpQ (101) left the C-terminal domains undi-
gested, and these domains still formed a ring-like structure
capable of forming ion channels upon insertion into lipid bi-
layers. In intact cells, the isolated C-terminal domain of PulD
still formed multimeric channels if the N-terminal domain was
coexpressed in trans; the function of the N-terminal domain
here is not clearly understood (235). Interestingly, electron
micrographs of intact PulD suggested that the N-terminal por-
tion may fold back into the central channel and close it (467).
However, the situation may be more complex, since the ring-
like structure in pullulanase secretion system apparently is
composed of 1:1 dimers of PulD and PulS (467). The PulD-
PulS oligomer is unable to form stable open channels in pla-
nar-bilayer assays (466). An informative study of the channel
and its gating again comes from that of pIV (398). Thus, the
expression of unaltered pIV did not make E. coli hypersuscep-
tible to a large, hydrophilic, and normally OM-impermeant
antibiotic, vancomycin, whereas that of a single-amino-acid
substitution mutant, S324G, did. Insertion of oligomers into
planar bilayers showed that the pIV channels were closed (un-
less extraordinarily high voltage was applied) whereas the mu-
tant channels were frequently open and that the single-channel
conductance was about 1 order of magnitude larger than that
of E. coli porins, suggesting that the diameter of the channel
was large. Finally, this mutant pIV allows the entry of malto-
dextrins into the periplasm in the absence of the speciﬁc chan-
nel LamB. Marciano et al. (399) showed that this entry of
maltodextrin is blocked by the assembly and extrusion of f1
phage, conﬁrming that the channel indeed serves as the exit for
the phage particles.
Plant and animal pathogens often possess extracellular se-
cretion systems of a different type, type III, which delivers
various effector proteins directly into the cytosol of the host
cells (for reviews, see references 145–147, 213, 281, and 443)
(Fig. 7). The type III complex resembles a syringe needle or
the basal body of ﬂagella (7). Remarkably, this complex also
contains one OM component, InvG in S. enterica serovar Ty-
phimurium or YscC in Yersinia (and its homologs), which
shows homology to PulD and its homologs in the type II se-
cretion system, as well as pIV. These InvG and YscC homologs
were also shown to produce ring-like multimers containing 12
to 14 subunits (154, 349).
Ushers. Components of P pili and type I pili of E. coli are
secreted into the periplasm by the Sec machinery, just like the
substrates of the type II export machinery. However, they are
secreted across the OM by a pathway completely different from
the type II pathway described above (652, 654). The pathway
here, called the chaperone-usher pathway, requires essentially
only two protein species, a periplasmic chaperone (PapD for P
pili) and an OM channel or usher that may also help in the
folding and polymerization of pili subunits (PapC for P pili), in
contrast to a dozen or so proteins required in the type II
secretion pathway. The ushers (80 to 90 kDa) are somewhat
larger than secretins. PapC, as well as its counterpart in type I
pili secretion, FimD, forms ring-like structures, as shown by
electron microscopy (579, 655). These rings are 15 nm across
and contain central pores 2 to 3 nm in diameter. Osmotic
swelling assays with PapC-containing proteoliposomes showed
the diffusion rates of various sugars to be relatively insensitive
to their size, conﬁrming the large pore size (655). It is still
unclear how many monomers are needed to form the ring. The
PapC oligomer was estimated to contain at least six monomers,
but no evidence for oligomerization has been found so far for
FaeD, an usher for the export of K88 pili in enterotoxigenic E.
coli (258). The monomeric subunit of PapC and FaeD each
seems to contain many -strands, at least 22 (258, 586, 652),
most of which are present in the central domain.
It is curious that the “terminal branch” (i.e., the part that
causes secretion across the OM) of the general secretion path-
way is so different between the chaperone-usher pathway and
the type II secretion pathway. Possibly the cause of this differ-
ence is the requirement for energy. In the chaperone-usher
pathway, the transported proteins polymerize into the pilus
structure during secretion, and the stabilization through poly-
merization is thought to provide the energy for transport (294).
In contrast, the type II secretion pathway exports monomeric
proteins (usually enzymes) and thus requires a large number of
proteins to provide the scaffolding and transduction of energy.
Autotransporters. Some proteins contain the information
needed for their transport in their own sequences. These pro-
teins, called autotransporters, are thought to use their C-ter-
minal domains to form OM channels for transport of their
N-terminal domains (for a review, see reference 266). This
hypothesis was proposed in a concrete form by Klauser et al.
(337), in part on the basis of the identiﬁcation of putative 15
-strands in the C-terminal domain of the Neisseria immuno-
globulin A protease precursor, a prototype autotransporter.
This idea has since been supported by the fusion of numerous
“passenger” peptides and proteins to the C-terminal domains
of various autotransporters. For example, the secretion of the
passenger, cholera toxin B subunit, by the C-terminal domain
of an autotransporter, AIDA-I, was shown to require all of the
presumed -strands and the intervening linker sequence (407).
Furthermore, the C-terminal domain of another autotrans-
porter, BrkA of B. pertussis, was found to produce channels in
planar lipid bilayers (606). However, in all these studies, each
autotransporter molecule was hypothesized to act indepen-
dently, its C-terminal domain facilitating the export of its own
N-terminal cargo domain (for example, see reference 407).

In a recent study of the C-terminal domain of the immuno-
globulin A protease precursor, this domain was again found to
produce presumably nonspeciﬁc pores, detected by the os-
motic swelling of the reconstituted proteoliposomes (698).
However, more importantly, electron microscopy and size ex-
clusion chromatography showed that this domain produced a
ring-like oligomeric complex containing at least six, and per-
haps more, monomers. Thus autotransporters apparently func-
tion by building a secretin-like oligomeric structure with a
2-nm channel in the center. This explains why proteins that are
folded and sometimes disulﬁde stabilized in the periplasm are
exported by the C-terminal domains of autotransporters (91,
697).
Other Export Channels
Type IV secretion pathway. The type IV secretion pathway
carries out the export of proteins or protein-DNA complexes,
and participates not only in the secretion of proteins but also in
the transfer of plasmids between bacterial cells and the injec-
tion into plant cells of tumor-generating T-DNA by Agrobac-
terium tumefaciens. This is a complex system requiring many
gene products, and the way in which the exported macromol-
ecules cross the OM is still not clear in spite of the recent
crystallization of ATPase molecules that form ring-like struc-
tures (for reviews, see references 35 and 135).
Two-partner secretion pathway. A protein secretion path-
way somewhat reminiscent of the autotransporters has at-
tracted attention in recent years. In this two-partner secretion
pathway, reviewed recently (293), both the exoprotein to be
secreted and the separate helper or channel protein are moved
into the periplasm via the usual Sec-dependent pathway. Then
the N-terminal domain of the passenger protein is recognized
by the channel protein, which is thought to form a -barrel
spanning the OM, and secretion results. Passenger proteins are
large (100 to 500 kDa) and apparently have a characteristic
folding pattern, like that of B. pertussis ﬁlamentous hemagglu-
tinin, FhaB. In this example, electron microscopy and model-
ing suggest that the protein folds in an unusual -helix con-
formation, eventually attaining a length of 50 nm (314). The
best studied transporters, ShlB of S. marcescens (344) and
FhaC of B. pertussis (233), were shown to fold as -barrels by
epitope insertion and protease cleavage studies. Both trans-
porters were shown to produce channels in planar lipid bilay-
ers, but such channels were unstable, suggesting the presence
of some form of gating (292, 344). FhaC allowed the perme-
ation of sugars, but again the speciﬁc activity was low. When a
secreted exoprotein is accumulated in the periplasm, it is ex-
tremely sensitive to proteolysis, a result suggesting that it is in
an extended conformation (585). Furthermore, chimeric pro-
teins containing a C-terminal addition of easily folded globular
domains cannot be translocated in this system (293). There-
fore, the secreted exoprotein is likely to cross the OM in an
extended conformation and become folded once it reaches the
cell surface. This folding can provide the energy for secretion.
FhaB hemagglutinin is synthesized as a 357-kDa giant protein,
but its C-terminal 137-kDa portion apparently becomes
cleaved by a subtilisin-like protease, SphB1, which gets to the
cell surface by using its own autotransporter function (151). It
is tempting to imagine that at least one function of this cleaved
C-terminal sequence is to act as a chaperone, in order to keep
the FhaB protein in an unfolded conformation within the
periplasm.
Both ShlB and FhaC migrate as monomers in SDS-PAGE,
even when extraction is done at low temperature, although a
small amount of a higher-molecular-weight fraction was ob-
served for the latter transporter (292, 344). If the passenger
protein is exported in its extended conformation, perhaps the
lumen of a single -barrel is sufﬁciently large for this purpose
and a large channel formed by an oligomeric complex of se-
cretin-like proteins may not be necessary (293).
Export channels for polysaccharides. Gram-negative bacte-
ria often export capsular polysaccharides or exopolysaccha-
rides. Such export processes have been studied in depth, espe-
cially in E. coli and related organisms. The most important
classes of capsular polysaccharides in E. coli are the group 1
and group 2 polysaccharides (296, 726). The former type of
polysaccharide is made up of oligosaccharide repeating units
(just like many O-antigen chains of LPS) and is synthesized in
a manner analogous to such O-antigen chains of LPS, that is,
by the addition of prefabricated repeating units to the reducing
end of the growing undecaprenol-pyrophosphate-linked poly-
mer, presumably at the external surface of the inner mem-
brane. The transport of the undecaprenol-linked repeating
unit across the cytoplasmic membrane is assumed to be carried
out by a polysaccharide transport (PST) family transporter,
presumably utilizing the proton motive force as energy (633).
In contrast, the group 2 capsule is usually made up of one or
perhaps two component sugars, is synthesized in the cytoplasm
by the successive addition of new sugar units at the nonreduc-
ing end of the growing polymer, and is then exported across the
envelope by an ABC transporter. In both cases, however, the
export across the OM is thought to occur through the channels
of a class of homologous proteins in the OMA (OM auxiliary)
protein
family
(487).
Furthermore,
the
export
requires
periplasmic proteins anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane,
belonging to either the MPA-1 family (for “cytoplasmic mem-
brane-periplasmic auxiliary protein 1”) for group 2 capsules or
the MPA-2 family for group 1 capsules. MPA-1 family proteins
are especially interesting, because their cytosolic domain con-
tains
an
ATPase-like structure, which is thought to regulate the length
of the polysaccharides exported via its protein tyrosine kinase
activity (44, 446, 699, 700).
An important observation on the OM channels of OMA
family proteins is that of Drummelsmith and Whitﬁeld (182).
They showed that an OMA member, WzaK30, a 40-kDa li-
poprotein involved in the export of group 1 capsulare polysac-
charide K30 of E. coli, occurs as secretin-like multimers that
are 11 nm in diameter and contain a 3-nm central cavity (or
hole). Among members of OMA family, all those involved in
the group 1 polysaccharide export are quite similar to WzaK30
in sequence, including the wza gene in the cps cluster in E. coli
K-12, involved in the biosynthesis of colanic acid (a nonspeciﬁc
“mucus” exopolysaccharide composed of hexasaccharide re-
peat units) (633). The same is true also for OMA members that
are involved in the export of group 2 polysaccharides in H.
inﬂuenzae (BexD for the export of polyribitol phosphate in
type b) and N. meningitidis (CtrA for the export of polysialic

acid). It is therefore reasonable to expect that these proteins
also function in the same manner.
The mechanism of export of the group 2 capsule in E. coli
has been studied extensively by using K1 antigen (polysialic
acid) (72) and K5 antigen (552, 726), and it appears more
complex than the export of group 1 polysaccharides. The KpsD
protein, which is a distantly related member of the OMA
family (487), has several unusual features. Unlike other mem-
bers of the OMA family, it does not contain the lipoprotein
signal sequence. It is much larger (about 64 kDa) than the
other OMA family members, and the C-terminal half of KpsD
shows no homology to the other members. Indeed, KpsD was
seen as a periplasmic protein (615). In a recent study, KpsD
was found in the OM, periplasm, and cytoplasmic membrane
depending on the genetic constitution of E. coli (25); it is found
exclusively in the OM only when all other transport compo-
nents are present but the capsular polysaccharide is not made
because of the defect in one of the polysaccharide biosynthesis
genes. The authors suggest that KpsD, together with the
MPA-1 protein KpsE, may drive the transperiplasmic trans-
port of the polysaccharide. It has also been suggested that the
polysaccharide is extruded through the porin channels (72);
this idea was supported by the observation that all naturally
occurring capsule-producing E. coli strains produced an extra
porin-like protein in the OM, called protein K (478). The
sequence of protein K has not been deposited in databases,
and it is not known if this protein is related to conventional
porins.
A family of putative polysaccharide export channels unre-
lated to the OMA family is known. These channels include
AlgE of P. aeruginosa (539) and AlgJ of Azotobacter vinelandii
(538), both of which are thought to be involved in the export of
alginate (a polysaccharide containing mannuronate and idur-
onate). AlgE was puriﬁed and shown to produce an anion
channel, whose conductivity is inhibited by the addition of
compounds containing mannuronate. These proteins (about 52
kDa) are larger than classical porins and were predicted to
span the OM as a 18-strand -barrel (539).
Entry of Colicins and Phage Nucleic Acids
Gram-negative bacteria are vulnerable to infection by
phages and killing by colicins. The A group colicins use the
TolA system (see below), and the B group colicins use the
TonB system, (see above) for penetration across the OM.
Table 1 shows examples of A group colicins, which use various
OM proteins as receptors and additionally may require an-
other OM protein, often a channel protein, for penetration.
Although the structures of several colicins have been deter-
mined by X-ray crystallography (for a review, see reference
771) and the domains involved in receptor binding, transloca-
tion, and ﬁnal killing activity have been localized by mostly
genetic approaches, the pathway by which colicin molecules
cross the OM is still somewhat controversial (114). Brieﬂy,
some scientists favor the idea that the initial receptor serves as
the translocation channel whereas others propose that the
translocation occurs at a site separate from the initial binding
site, perhaps through a porin or through the lipid bilayer. Cao
and Klebba (114) argue, mainly on the basis of the data from
Letellier and coworkers (47, 85, 183), that at least colicins A
and N (Table 1) are likely to pass through the porin channels
in a more or less denatured form. Zakharov and Cramer (771)
also conclude that colicin E1 (Table 1) will pass through the
TolC channel tunnel in a largely denatured form, despite its
initial interaction with the receptor, BtuB. The inward move-
ment of the long, unwound colicin molecules through the nar-
row channels of the OM proteins, however, cannot occur with-
out being driven by an input of energy. This is where the Tol
(or Ton) system is thought to function.
As described above, energization of transport through the
gated receptor channels by TonB requires two associated pro-
teins in the inner membrane, ExbB and ExbD. The Tol system
is very similar in having the TolA protein (which lies mostly in
the periplasm with its N-terminus inserted in the inner mem-
brane), which is surrounded by TolQ and TolR (which corre-
spond to ExbB and ExbD, respectively, in terms of topology)
(384) (Fig. 5). There is an extra member in the Tol system,
TolB, which is a periplasmic protein. The Tol system, which
“stabilizes” the OM structure through a poorly understood
mechanism (see “Alterations of the OM bilayer barrier” be-
low), somehow supplies the energy (or even movement)
needed for colicin uptake. However, despite the tantalizing
similarity of TolQR proteins to MotAB stator proteins of the
ﬂagellar motor (119, 346), the mechanistic details remain un-
known.
The injection of bacteriophage nucleic acids does not usually
require the Tol system and, hence, energy. Most of the studies
in this area have been done with tailed double-stranded DNA
phages. Phages of the family Myoviridae (for classiﬁcation of
tailed phages, see reference 5), including T4, P1, and P2, have
contractile tails, in which the contraction of the sheath is
thought to bring the central hollow tube through the OM
(431). Some morphological studies suggest that this insertion
of the tail core occurs at, or induces the formation of, the
OM-inner membrane fusion structure (649). The structure of
the central, needle-like device which is used by T4 to puncture
the OM was solved recently (317). In this structure (Fig. 8B),
three molecules of gp5 protein come together so that its C-
terminal domain forms a three-strand -helix with a triangular

cross-section. The width of this tube-like structure becomes
smaller as it reaches the tip, and thus it seems to function as a
sharp puncturing needle at the time of sheath contraction.
Unlike the T4 short tail ﬁber made of a similar triple -helix of
gp12 (421), the central core of the helix of gp5 is not strongly
hydrophobic. However, the central channel is not wide enough
for the conduction of DNA, and this presumably occurs by the
subsequent juxtaposition of the end of the tail tube onto the
cytoplasmic membrane (317).
Injection of DNA by members of the Siphoviridae (including
phages T5, , and T1) has been studied in detail in recent
years. Phage  was found to inject its DNA into proteolipo-
somes containing its receptor, LamB, in 1986 (556). This ob-
servation has been conﬁrmed by the appearance of high-con-
ductance channels (0.7 nS), but it is not clear if this is the result
of an expansion of the LamB channel or if it is formed by the
insertion of phage proteins into the bilayer (54). Phage T5 uses
the ferrichrome receptor FhuA as the receptor. Binding to
FhuA is mediated by protein pb5 (502), but protein pb2, which
forms the long tail ﬁber and has a high molecular mass (108
kDa), is not needed for adsorption. In 1990, pb2 was puriﬁed,
inserted into the black lipid membrane, and shown to produce
channels of an exceptionally high conductance of 4.6 nS in the
absence of FhuA (204). When T5 was later shown to inject its
DNA into FhuA-containing proteoliposomes (501), the results
with pb2 were somehow forgotten and it was proposed that T5
DNA would diffuse through the opened FhuA channel (82). A
more recent study by using cryoelectron tomography (77)
shows beautifully that FhuA simply acts as an anchor and that
the tail ﬁber made of pb2 traverses the lipid bilayer nearby,
possibly allowing DNA transfer. Interestingly, the tail tip un-
dergoes a major conformational change, and its length is short-
ened from 50 to 23 nm, with a concomitant increase in diam-
eter. In T7, which belongs to the family Podoviridae (also
including P22), the tail is very short. Here the proteins that
form DNA channels are ejected from the phage particle core
(rather than being a part of the preexisting tail). One of the
proteins, gp14 (21 kDa), is localized in the OM, and a remark-
ably large protein, gp16 (144 kDa), becomes located in the
inner membrane. Together with gp15, these proteins are hy-
pothesized to form the channel for DNA injection, but details
are not yet known (426). Data on phage DNA injection up to
1994 have been reviewed by Dreiseikelmann (181).
In contrast to the systems so far described, the Tol system
(and therefore energy) is required for infection of F E. coli by
the ﬁlamentous phage f1 (136) and of V. cholerae by the chol-
era toxin-encoding ﬁlamentous phage CTX (261). Although
the Tol system is required for the insertion of the major capsid
protein into the inner membrane, presumably simultaneously
with the disassembly of the phage and the translocation of
DNA into the cytoplasm (137), this does not necessarily rule
out the possibility that it is needed for an earlier event, such as
the translocation of phage tip protein pIII to the surface of the
inner membrane, a process that may be analogous to the entry
of colicin into the periplasmic space. In fact, for the related
phage fd, the N-terminal domain of pIII (or g3p) was shown to
interact with the C-terminal domain of TolA (presumably after
penetrating across the OM barrier), once the block on this
interaction is lifted by the interaction of the central domain of
g3p with the pilus (544). Since g3p is known to produce a
channel of rather high conductance (0.82 nS) in planar bilayer
(223), this interaction with TolA is hypothesized to bring down
the C-terminal domain of g3p into the inner membrane, where
it is thought to form a DNA transfer channel (544).
In an exceptional case (the double-stranded RNA phage 6
of P. syringae), the early stage of infection involves the fusion of
the viral capsid membrane with that of the host OM (32). This
unusual membrane fusion event is catalyzed by a fusogenic
protein, P6 (32, 417). For another unusual double-stranded
DNA phage containing an internal membrane, PRD1, genetic
evidence suggests that a viral protein, P11, produces a channel
across the OM (231).
THE LIPID BILAYER AS A DIFFUSION BARRIER
The Asymmetric Bilayer
The location of LPS in the OM was studied in our laboratory
many years ago. First, quantitation of LPS and phospholipids
led to the prediction that each species may cover an equal area,
corresponding to the surface of the OM (excluding the area
occupied by OM proteins) (624). We then suggested that LPS
comprised all of the outer leaﬂet of the OM, because chemical
labeling of amino groups with intact cells of S. enterica serovar
Typhimurium, by the use of an OM-impermeable macromo-
lecular reagent, failed to label any of the phosphatidylethanol-
amine molecules (316). The latter paper was rejected twice by
Biochemistry because a reviewer insisted that such an asym-
metric distribution of bilayer components was “thermodynam-
ically impossible.” It amuses the present author that this con-
cept is mentioned in many recent publications without any
reference, as though it is self-evident.
I mention this ancient history because the concept of an
asymmetric bilayer does not appear to have been tested many
times with similar rigor. Labeling intact cells of Erwinia caro-
tovora with trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid showed that 3% of the
total phosphatidylethanolamine was exposed on the cell sur-
face (611); it was not tested if the reagent penetrated through
the OM. The generally high susceptibility of N. gonorrhoeae to
lipophilic agents may be consistent with the presence of a
mixed LPS-phospholipid leaﬂet in the OM, but phospholipase
C digestion of intact cells suggested that the outer leaﬂet did
not contain much phospholipid (391). In contrast, the presence
of phospholipids on the outer surface of OM was detected by
using a macromolecular labeling reagent with V. cholerae
(486), and a similar situation may be found with some other
gram-negative bacteria.
General Structure of LPS
Many reviews are available on the structure, biosynthesis,
and genetic determination of LPS (262, 526–528, 594), includ-
ing an extensive review with 810 references, emphasizing struc-
ture (735). A recent and comprehensive review discusses LPS
structure and biosynthesis in detail (529). LPS typically is com-
posed of lipid A, a short core oligosaccharide, and an O anti-
gen that may be a long polysaccharide. As seen in Fig. 9 (left),
E. coli K-12 lipid A consists of a -1,6-linked glucosamine
disaccharide backbone, with its 2, 3, 2, and 3 positions acy-
lated by the characteristic (R)-3-hydroxymyristic acid residues.

The fatty acids linked to the nonreducing sugar residue are
further acylated on their hydroxyl groups, producing charac-
teristic piggyback (or, more correctly, acyloxyacyl) structures.
Furthermore, both “ends” of the disaccharide structure, i.e.,
the 1 and 4 positions, are typically phosphorylated. The core
domain of LPS usually contains a few KDO (3-deoxy-D-
manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid) residues at its inner end, and this is
extended by a few heptose residues, some of which are phos-
phorylated or carry phosphoethanolamine or pyrophospho-
ethanolamine substituents. The outermost part of the core
consists mostly of hexoses. The structure of the core oligosac-
charides is shown in Fig. 10, and it can be seen that this region
contains many anionic groups, which appear to be more evenly
distributed in E. coli (Fig. 10A) than in P. aeruginosa (Fig.
10B). The core oligosaccharide can be divided into the outer
core and inner core, the latter usually consisting of the region
composed of heptose and KDO residues (Fig. 10A). Although
E. coli K-12 cannot synthesize the O chain because of an
insertion mutation (634) and thus produces a “rough” or R-
type LPS devoid of O chains, most wild-type strains of mem-
bers of the Enterobacteriaceae synthesize this outermost struc-
ture of LPS, which often consists of oligosaccharide repeating
units (735).
Because LPS biosynthesis is covered well in other reviews,
especially in the review by Raetz and Whitﬁeld (529), this topic
is not discussed here. However, it should be pointed out that an
ABC transporter, MsbA, located in the cytoplasmic mem-
brane, whose structure was solved by X-ray crystallography
(124), is involved in the ﬂipping of lipid A (and possibly the
R-type LPS containing the core) across the membrane (176,
177, 786). It is not clear how the completed LPS reaches the
outer membrane. A recent paper claims that an OM protein,
Omp85, in Neisseria performs this function but is not involved
in the export of OM proteins (218). However, the results rely
entirely on the phenotype of the strain in which the expression
of this protein was hindered, and the conclusion is not yet
totally convincing. The controversial nature of the conclusion
can be also seen from the report of another group concluding
that the same protein is involved in the export of OM proteins

(703). A more direct biochemical study is necessary in this
area.
There is no question that the LPS leaﬂet in the OM pro-
duces a very effective barrier for the spontaneous diffusion of
lipophilic compounds. Earlier, we thought that the Salmonella
OM containing the intact LPS leaﬂet was essentially imperme-
able to lipophilic solutes (451). This apparent impermeability
later turned out to be the result of slow inﬂux across the OM
counteracted by active efﬂux (456). Nevertheless, when the
diffusion rates of very hydrophobic test solutes, i.e., steroids,
were measured experimentally by coupling their inﬂux with
oxidation in the cytoplasm (503, 504), their diffusion across the
OM was found to be about 2 orders of magnitude slower than
the diffusion through typical cell membranes containing phos-
pholipid bilayers, showing that, indeed, the lipid bilayer do-
main of OM is an effective barrier.
Mutants that synthesize severely truncated cores, commonly
called deep rough mutants, cannot insert many OM proteins
and consequently have to ﬁll the “void” in the OM with phos-
pholipids (464). Cells of these mutants, containing patches of
phospholipid bilayers, unlike in the wild type (316), are hyper-
sensitive to lipophilic inhibitors (464, 685), a result consistent
with the fact that phospholipid bilayers allow a much more
rapid penetration of these compounds. With these data alone,
we cannot eliminate the possibility that the deep rough LPS
itself produces a more permeable leaﬂet, a hypothesis advo-
cated by some workers on the basis of minor differences in the
melting temperature of isolated LPS preparations (90). How-
ever, such differences are more likely to be due to variations in
divalent cation content among LPS preparations (see below)
(735). Lipophilic probes indeed partition with equal efﬁciency
into the lipid domains of normal as well as deep rough LPS
(686). Furthermore, reconstitution of vesicles surrounded by
pure LPS bilayers (627) and measurement of the bilayer per-
meability showed unequivocally that bilayers of deep rough
LPS and wild-type LPS have comparable permeability (626).
Some recent data, however, are not easily explained by this
concept. Although a defect in the phosphorylation of the distal
core heptose (HepII in Fig. 10A) used to be thought to result
in the truncated core and therefore to lead to a deep rough
phenotype (265), disruption of the waaP gene, responsible for
this phosphorylation, did not produce a complete truncation of
the core (758). Therefore, the mutant used in the early study,
isolated by chemical mutagenesis followed by selection for
core-truncated mutants (265), must have contained multiple
mutations. Even more importantly, the “clean” waaP mutant
did not show decreased levels of OM proteins yet was hyper-
sensitive to hydrophobic agents (759, 760). It is difﬁcult to
reconcile this result with a large body of evidence supporting
the phospholipid bilayer hypothesis mentioned above, and fur-
ther study is obviously needed.
The O chains deﬁne the properties of the cell surface in
species that do not produce capsules and are important in
evading immune attacks from the host, for example by invent-

the presence of one positive charge in N-alanylgalactosamine). The E. coli core carries about 5.5 formal negative charges, but they are present in
a more dispersed manner.

ing novel and unusual structures (for example, 3,6-dideoxyhex-
oses in Salmonella) or by mimicking the structures on host cell
surface (for example, mimicking gangliosides in C. jejuni
[428]). Some wild-type organisms produce LPS containing very
short or no O chains. A well-known example is N. gonorrhoeae,
and some workers advocate the use of term “lipooligosaccha-
ride” in order to emphasize this feature. For some organisms
(e.g., N. gonorrhoeae), the production of short chains may be
beneﬁcial because they allow intimate interaction with the host
cell membrane. For others (e.g., N. meningitidis), an O chain
would not be needed because the cell surface is covered by a
thick layer of capsular polysaccharide.
It is not impossible that interactions between neighboring O
side chains contribute to the stabilization of the LPS leaﬂet,
but not many papers have been published on this point since
the intriguing study by Morrison and Leive (430). One impor-
tant observation is that the melting temperature of the hydro-
carbon domain of LPS is the lowest in Re LPS and increases in
S LPS (90, 439); this is likely to reﬂect the increased interaction
between neighboring LPS molecules through the O chain (and
maybe the outer core region [439]). Yeh and Jacobs (756)
found that when added to phosphatidylcholine liposomes, the
LPS fraction containing long O side chains decreased the ﬂu-
idity of the phospholipid bilayer more effectively than did the
fraction with short or no side chains, suggesting that O side
chains affect the behavior of lipid A domain. Furthermore, the
lateral diffusion of an OM protein, IcsA, becomes somewhat
faster (perhaps twofold) in a mutant that cannot synthesize the
LPS O chain (551). A recent report shows that deletion of the
O side chain increases the weak-acid sensitivity of both E. coli
and S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (38), but the effect is very
slight. It should be noted that in most strains, only a small
fraction of LPS molecules appear to contain long O side
chains, a feature regulated by a gene called rol (reference 41
and references therein), cld, or wzz (537).
What Makes the LPS Leaﬂet an Effective
Permeability Barrier?
Low ﬂuidity of the LPS hydrocarbon domain. The fatty acid
substituents in LPS from enteric bacteria, grown under the
usual conditions, are all saturated. Further, increased numbers
of fatty acyl substituents per molecule of lipid usually decrease
the ﬂuidity of the hydrocarbon region (see below). Therefore,
it is reasonable to expect that the hydrocarbon regions of LPS
are in a gel-like state of very low ﬂuidity under the usual
conditions of growth for bacteria. Indeed, differential scanning
calorimetry using intact E. coli cells detected no thermal tran-
sition caused by the melting of LPS, up to about 60°C, where
proteins begin to become denatured (413), and isolated LPS in
the presence of 10 mM Mg2 showed no thermal melting up to
75°C (463), clearly suggesting that the lipid interior of LPS
remains in a gel-like state even at a high temperature. In
addition, X-ray diffraction studies of isolated LPS showed that
the hydrocarbon chains are highly ordered and in a nearly
crystalline arrangement, with a characteristic, sharp 4.2-A˚ re-
ﬂection (the measured value was actually 4.25 A˚) rather than
the diffuse 4.5-A˚ reﬂection seen in liquid-crystalline lipids
(363). Furthermore, this gel-like structure did not melt at least
up to 50°C. This rigidity of the lipid interior explains the low
permeability of small hydrophobic solutes across the OM
(504).
This concept of the gel-like interior of LPS has, however,
been challenged by some studies. To understand the nature of
this controversy, it is important to realize that LPS is a poly-
anionic lipid. Thus, there are usually two monophosphate sub-
stitutents in lipid A (at the 1 and 4 positions)(Fig. 9, left) and
in the inner core region there are a few carboxyl groups of
KDO
residues
and
monophosphate
(or
pyrophosphate
[diphosphate]) substituents on the heptose residue(s) (Fig. 10).
Considering that lipid A usually contains six hydrocarbon
chains, the density of formal negative charges is more than 1
per hydrocarbon chain. This is far higher than in the usual
acidic phospholipids, where the ratio is about 0.5 per hydro-
carbon chain. With acidic lipids, the neutralization and bridg-
ing of negative charges by divalent cations is a major factor in
determining the lateral interaction between lipids and hence
the ﬂuidity and melting behavior of the bilayer. As an example,
with the acidic lipid phosphatidylserine, the melting tempera-
ture increases by more than 50°C when 1 mM Ca2 is added to
bridge the negative charges (481). Effects of similar magnitude
are expected with LPS. In fact, an early study (214) showed
that removing most of the monovalent cations from LPS by
electrodialysis and replacing them with various cations pro-
duced huge changes in the aggregation state of LPS. Thus, a
bulky organic cation, triethylamine, produced a clear solution
with the smallest aggregate size whereas the divalent cations
Mg2 and especially Ca2 produced huge, insoluble aggre-
gates. In fact, E. coli LPS is known to contain, even after
extensive dialysis, about 4 mol of Mg2 and 1 mol of Ca2 per
mol (149). Electron probe microanalysis showed that in thin
sections of washed E. coli cells, the content of divalent cations
in the envelope region is about 10 mol of Mg2 and 2 mol of
Ca2 per mol of LPS (data from reference 123 recalculated
according to the LPS content per cell [624]). When Wiese et al.
(732) calculated the intrinsic transmembrane potential in the
LPS-phospholipid asymmetric bilayer by assuming that all
phosphate and carboxylate groups were dissociated, they found
a value of 74 mV. In contrast, when the actual potential was
measured under the conditions where the LPS molecules were
facing 10 mM Mg2, it was only 38 mV (731), suggesting that
at least half of these formal negative charges are neutralized by
divalent cations. A molecular dynamics simulation showed,
quite predictably, that lateral association of LPS molecules was
not possible unless divalent cations were present (350); this
study was marred, however, by the “visualization,” by atomic
force microscopy, of O-antigen side chains that should be ab-
sent in the E. coli JM109 strain, a derivative of K-12.
In spite of these data, early studies of melting behavior paid
little attention to the divalent-cation content of LPS. Thus,
many studies claiming that LPS hydrocarbon “melts” between
30 and 37°C (see, for example, reference 90) were done in the
absence of any added divalent cations and seem to have little
relevance to the situation in real bacterial cell. Unfortunately,
the thermal transition in LPS has not been studied in intact
cells since the early work of Melchior and Steim (admittedly
carried out with a low-sensitivity instrument) that detected no
cooperative melting up to about 50°C (413). I nevertheless feel
that the cooperative melting of LPS around 37°C, i.e., the
optimum growth temperature of E. coli, is unlikely to occur in

intact cells. This is because lipid bilayers are known to become
highly leaky, at the thermal transition temperature, to solutes
of up to 900 Da (74, 695). (This ﬁnding was conﬁrmed in
several other laboratories [reference 260 and references
therein].) Since the major function of the bacterial OM is to
serve as a permeability barrier, it is highly unlikely that the
structure of LPS has evolved to defeat this purpose precisely at
the optimal growth temperature.
LPS in intact cells is therefore likely to melt at a much higher
temperature than the temperatures observed with puriﬁed
LPS. Nevertheless, the study of the latter system gives us some
interesting pieces of information. In more recent studies (89,
604), it was shown that Mg2 raises the melting temperature of
lipid A. Furthermore, the melting temperature of lipid A mea-
sured by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was about
57°C, in comparison with that of dioleoylglycerophosphate
(about 3°C) (89), showing clearly that lipid A hydrocarbons are
in a much more strongly ordered state. It should also be em-
phasized that simply adding divalent cations to LPS prepara-
tions may not be enough; the huge effect of cations (described
above) could be seen only when most of the resident cations
were ﬁrst removed by electrodialysis. One study (439), how-
ever, included a few electrodialyzed and then neutralized LPS
samples and found that the Ca2 form of Salmonella S-LPS
melted at a temperature 6°C higher than did the Na form of
Citrobacter S-LPS, although it is unclear if such a comparison
of LPS of different origin can be justiﬁed.
There were differences in the melting temperature of mutant
LPS molecules from the same species. Thus, the complete
S-LPS had a relatively high transition temperature, which de-
creased in Re LPS but increased again in lipid A (90, 439). In
an X-ray diffraction study using different types of LPS with
high water content (88), the molecular cross-section of lipid A
and S-LPS did not change much when the temperature was
raised from 20 to 40°C, but under the same conditions, that of
deep rough LPS increased drastically (about twofold). Presum-
ably, neighboring lipid A molecules may undergo strong inter-
molecular interactions because only a few phosphate moieties
are present, but the interaction is weakened in Re LPS owing
to the additional presence of two negatively charged KDO
residues. These considerations then suggest that further in-
creases in negative charges, due to the presence of phosphate
groups on heptose residues, must be more than balanced by
intermolecular interactions between the distal parts of the core
and/or the O side chains.
In view of their importance in intermolecular interactions,
the anionic groups in lipid A and the deep core region of LPS
merit some consideration. It seems most likely that phospho-
monoester groups on lipid A as well as on the heptose residue
are dissociated in the LPS leaﬂet of the outer membrane, in
view of the very low pKa values of these groups. However, I
think it is debatable whether the carboxylate groups of KDO
are always dissociated in this highly acidic local environment,
since the simple carboxyl groups are not strong acids. Perhaps
they are there to increase lateral interactions between LPS
molecules through divalent cation bridging if such ions are
available, but they become protonated (so as to prevent the
increase in intermolecular repulsion) when divalent cations are
scarce or the pH becomes more acidic in the environment.
In connection with the important role played by divalent
cations, some authors assume that a source of such cations may
be an “LPS-associated” calcium exporter (10). However, this
seems unlikely. LPS chelates very large amounts of divalent
cations (123), as mentioned above. Since the intracellular con-
centration of Ca2 in bacterial cells must be very low, at sub-
micromolar or even nanomolar levels, as in any living cells,
exporting Ca2 from cytosol does not seem to make much
difference to the supply of this ion for the construction of the
LPS layer. Furthermore, there is no evidence that this putative
Ca2 pump has anything to do with LPS assembly, except that
its gene is located near the LPS biosynthetic genes (10).
Strong lateral interactions between LPS molecules. LPS
from many species have powerful biological actions when in-
troduced into the bloodstream of higher animals and humans.
This “endotoxic” activity of LPS has attracted the attention of
many scientists over the years. However, the signiﬁcance of
LPS synthesis for most, nonpathogenic gram-negative bacteria
undoubtedly lies in the fact that it can produce a very effective
permeability barrier, presumably as a consequence of the gel-
like interior of the LPS leaﬂet. Production of this low-ﬂuidity
interior presumably requires a strong interaction between
neighboring LPS molecules.
In fact, when patches of LPS were added to phospholipid
bilayers in the presence of Mg2, domains of pure LPS appar-
ently persisted for days without becoming mixed with phospho-
lipids, showing the existence of a very strong lateral interaction
between LPS molecules (647). As mentioned above, the ionic
interactions, including the bridging action of divalent cations,
is probably a major factor in this lateral interaction. Are there
any other factors? By comparing the structure of LPS with that
of simple phospholipids, we can detect possible additional fea-
tures of LPS that may contribute to their strong lateral inter-
action. (i) The ﬁrst feature is the presence of several (six or
seven in E. coli and Salmonella) fatty acid chains per molecule
of LPS, in comparison with only two such chains in the usual
phospholipids. The presence of more fatty acid chains per lipid
molecule is likely to result in stronger lateral interactions be-
cause of the increased surface area. In fact, a major lipid in the
plasma membrane of a thermophile, Thermus, is a dihexosyl-
(N-acylglucosaminyl)-hexosyl-(diacylglycerol), containing three,
rather than two, acyl chains (477). It is likely that the presence
of one extra acyl group in this lipid contributes to the increased
membrane stability at high temperatures, because the fatty
acid chains are of normal lengths (the carbohydrate head
groups may also contribute to the lateral interaction [see be-
low]). (ii) Some glycerophospholipids, e.g., phosphatidylcho-
line, do not contain any groups that can act as H-bond donors.
In contrast, many such groups are present in LPS. Lipid A is a
glycolipid with the -1,6-linked glucosaminyl-glucosamine as
its backbone, and the 4-OH group of the reducing glucosamine
residue is free to act as an H-bond donor. Furthermore, the
two NH groups at the 2 and 2 positions can also act in this
way. Finally, the core oligosaccharide linked to the 6 position
of the nonreducing glucosamine provides numerous groups
that could act as both donors and acceptors of H bonds (Fig.
10A). (iii) In contrast to phospholipids, lipid A contains a
number of hydroxy fatty acids. The characteristic 3-OH-myr-
istic acid residues occur at the 2, 3, 2, and 3 positions, as
mentioned above. The residues at the 2 and 3 positions do not

usually carry the piggyback substituuents, and thus there are
two hydroxyl groups within the membrane interior that can act
as H-bond donors (Fig. 9, left).
Features (ii) and (iii) above suggest that H bonding between
neighboring LPS molecules may be important in stabilizing the
structure of the LPS leaﬂet. These features are strikingly sim-
ilar to the properties of glycosphingolipids (Fig. 9, right),
whose head groups also contain sugars with many hydroxyl
groups. In addition, in sphingolipids the sphingosine base itself
contains the NH group and either one (sphingosine) or two
(phytosphingosine) free OH groups. Finally, the fatty acid res-
idue that is amide linked to the base is often hydroxylated.
Interestingly, the number of OH groups in sphingolipids seems
to parallel the degree of stress that the cells must endure (321).
Thus, sphingolipids from muscle cells and erythrocytes contain
sphingosine (with only one free OH group) substituted with
nonhydroxy fatty acyl residues. In contrast, those from cells of
the intestinal epithelium contain mostly 2-hydroxy fatty acyl
residues attached to the base containing two OH groups. In
unicellular organisms (yeast and amoebae), which are often
exposed to toxic compounds in the environment, the acyl moi-
ety can even be dihydroxylated, increasing the number of free
OH groups in the substituted ceramide to four (321). These
features suggest that glycosphingolipids may produce unusu-
ally stable membranes through their strong lateral interactions
mediated by H bonds, and in recent years “rafts” composed of
sphingolipids and cholesterol have indeed been isolated as
Triton X-100-insoluble patches of eukaryotic cell membranes
(386). Furthermore, the lateral interaction via numerous H
bonds has been demonstrated by X-ray crystallographic anal-
ysis of a galactosyl ceramide (484). Intermolecular H-bonds
between lipids persist even in aqueous media, because the
lipids are placed in close proximity by the hydrophobic effect
and the van der Waals interactions (76); this is similar to the
formation of an H-bonded -helix in aqueous solution of some
short peptides. Triton X-100 does not disrupt H-bonded struc-
tures, and this may be one of the reasons why “rafts” remain
insoluble in this detergent. Similarly, the OM is also insoluble
in Triton X-100 (unless the LPS leaﬂet is destablized by the
removal of divalent cations, as reported originally by Schnait-
man in 1971 [592, 593; see also reference 449]). These obser-
vations strongly suggest that LPS and glycosphingolipids are
similar in producing stable domains in the membrane as a
result of the extensive H bonding between neighboring mole-
cules. Interestingly, the structure proposed for a deep rough
LPS from E. coli (328) suggests that the free OH group of
3-OH-myristoyl moieties at the 2 and 3 positions of lipid A are
located very close to the inner core sugar moiety at the 6
position of the neighboring LPS molecule.
Do glycosphingolipid leaﬂets also act as permeability bar-
rier? The observation that the sphingolipid-rich rafts are found
in the apical membranes of cells of the intestinal epithelium or
of the epithelium of bladder and kidney tubules (620) suggests
that this is indeed the case. The intermolecular H bonding, as
well as the saturated nature of hydrocarbon chains in sphin-
golipids, will produce an ordered rather than liquid crystalline
lipid interior (386), and this will make the spontaneous trans-
membrane diffusion of solutes difﬁcult. However, just as the
research on LPS function was dominated by concerns about
their endotoxic activity, studies of rafts have concentrated on
their roles in the signaling pathways (619); surprisingly few
inquiries were made about the permeability of the sphingolipid
domains. Recently, Hill and Zeidel (272) showed that bilayers
composed of lipids with the calculated composition of the
outer leaﬂet of the apical membrane of MDCK kidney cells,
containing mostly sphingolipids and cholesterol, were nearly
100-fold less permeable to small solutes, such as glycerol, than
were bilayers containing mostly glycerophospholipids. It there-
fore turns out that both E. coli and our own intestinal epithelial
cells, facing the same milieu, employ the same strategy to build
membrane barriers that are unusually resistant to the solubi-
lizing activity of bile salts and that prevent the permeation of
such noxious solute molecules. Similarity between the two sys-
tems is even more pronounced, since toxic molecules that
slowly leak in through these membranes are actively pumped
out by multidrug efﬂux pumps (such as AcrAB-TolC in E. coli
[776] and MDR1, which is highly expressed in the apical mem-
branes of intestinal cells [656]).
Conformation of LPS in bilayers. The ﬁrst model of lipid A
and LPS, derived largely via an energy minimization approach,
appeared in 1985 (363). The model used the heptaacylated
lipid A from Salmonella, with the PhoPQ-regulated addition of
palmitate residue on the hydroxyl group of 3-OH-myristate
amide-linked to the 2 position of the reducing glucosamine
residue (see “Physiological adaptation in LPS structure” be-
low). The seven fatty acid chains occupy the nodes of a hex-
agonal lattice with an edge of 4.9 A˚, a ﬁnding that explains the
presence of a sharp, 4.25-A˚ (sin60° 
 4.9) meridional reﬂec-
tion, corresponding to the ordered lipid phase, in X-ray dif-
fraction experiments (363). Importantly, the GlcN-(16)-
GlcN disaccharide backbone was predicted to be tilted in
relation to the plane of the membrane, with the nonreducing
glucosamine residue farther away from the membrane. This is
precisely the conformation found for LPS bound to FhuA
(described in the next section). The quasi-crystalline, ordered
arrangement of hydrocarbon chains was also conﬁrmed by
using synthetic lipid A with the correct structure, whereas the

positions, as well as those linked as piggybacked residues on the 2- and
3-linked 3-OH-myristoyl residues [these are shown as (2) and (3)] of
E. coli Re LPS are shown by overlaying the structure of the energy-
minimized conformer A described by Obst et al. (469) onto the two-
dimensional hexagonal lattice.

synthetic compounds representing the earlier, incorrect struc-
ture showed a liquid crystalline, disordered structure (364).
The modeling was extended to hexa-acylated lipid A from E.
coli, and the prediction was similar in that the six hydrocarbon
chains were optimally located in the nodes of a hexagonal
lattice (326, 439) (Fig. 11). It was also predicted that the bridg-
ing by divalent cations would bring the carboxylate group of
KDOII close to the 1-phosphate on the reducing GlcN residue,
a feature that is found in the experimentally determined struc-
ture of LPS bound to FhuA (203), with the distance between
KDOII carboxyl and the phosphodiester oxygens being only 5
A˚ (see below). Again, the axis of glucosamine disaccharide is
predicted to be tilted by about 40° in relation to the plane of
the membrane. (The conformation of the polysaccharide chain
of LPS was also estimated by energy minimization, with the
result that O chains were predicted to be bent strongly against
the membrane normal [325].) The energy minimization ap-
proach predicted several different conformers of Re LPS
(326), and molecular dynamics simulation of single LPS mol-
ecules preserved the initial conformation (469). The next im-
portant step, the simulation of the LPS aggregate, an effort
that required 3 months of computer time, was performed by
Kotra et al. (350). The paper, unfortunately, does not supply
much information, aside from the necessity for divalent cations
to form a monolayer/leaﬂet structure. Thus, although the ab-
stract of that paper indicates that LPS molecules are tightly
assembled next to each other, there is no detailed description
of the packing between LPS molecules. The equilibrium posi-
tions of individual fatty acyl chains are not described. Although
simulation at a single-LPS level did not convert one conformer
to the other, as described above, Kotra et al. (350) did not
specify which conformer was used for simulation nor give in-
formation about interconversion between different conform-
ers. The structures of the R core and O antigen (which should
not exist in this strain) chosen for the modeling were not
described either. Some of these deﬁciencies are not present in
the molecular dynamic simulation of the P. aeruginosa OM
bilayer (380, 610). Thus, the GlcN-GlcN backbone of all LPS
molecules become oriented in a similar direction, and, most
importantly, the divalent cation (Ca2 was used in this simu-
lation) binds four neighboring LPS molecules by coordinating
with phosphate groups at the 1 and 4 positions. Unfortunately,
the P. aeruginosa LPS structure used by the authors was incor-
rect in the distribution of acyloxyacyl substituents in lipid A
(see “Physiological adaptation in LPS structure” below and
Fig. 14B).
An X-ray crystallographic analysis of LPS would be highly
desirable. Kato’s laboratory has crystallized numerous natural
LPS species and synthetic lipid A (for reference, see reference
328). However, none of the crystals diffracted to a high reso-
lution. The atomic force microscopy of Re LPS ﬁlms gave
interesting results. The surface representing the methyl ends
(omega carbons) of the acyl chains had a hexagonal pattern,
with a lozenge-shaped unit cell with sides of 6.5 and 5.5 A˚.
Each fatty acyl chain is thought to be located at the nodes of
this hexagonal lattice. In contrast, the hydrophilic surface pro-
duced a somewhat less ordered pattern, thought to reﬂect the
presence of two KDO residues. On the basis of these results, a
model was proposed in which the carboxyl group of KDOII is
located rather close to the 1-phosphate substituent on the
reducing GlcN (328). This model is quite different from the
earlier energy minimization models (439) in that the hydrocar-
bon chains are much farther apart (5.5 and 6.5 A˚) than 4.9 A˚.
One likely reason is that Re LPS has the lowest melting point
and has the loose packing of hydrocarbon chains (439). An-
other is that this crystal was made in triethylamine, a bulky
organic cation, which presumably expanded the structure by
competing with divalent cations. Therefore, the tilt of the di-
glucosamine axis, which is the consequence of the tight packing
of the hydrocarbon chains against each other, was rather small
in this model. Interestingly, the distance between various hy-
drocarbon chains in the FhuA-bound LPS is quite short (in the
range of 4.2 to 4.8 A˚), and in this sense again this structure is
closer to the tightly packed model (439) than to the loosely
packed, expanded model of Kato et al. (328).
Conformation of LPS in the LPS-FhuA complex. In a recent
X-ray crystallographic structure of OM protein FhuA, one
molecule of LPS was cocrystallized (202). (Tight association of
LPS to E. coli porins was reported [554], but the crystal struc-
ture of the classical porins does not show LPS molecules.)
Although this may not necessarily tell us everything about the
nature of LPS-LPS interactions, the structure reinforces the
importance of anionic groups. The interaction between LPS
and FhuA was studied in detail; this study led to the conclusion
that the basic amino acid side chains playing important roles in
this interaction are also conserved in other LPS-binding pro-
teins, such as the serum LPS-binding protein, neutrophil bac-
tericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI), lactoferrin, ly-
sozyme, and Limulus antibacterial and anti-LPS factor (203).
Furthermore, a similar putative LPS-binding site was recently
found on the external surface of the 10-strand -barrel of the
OM-associated protease, OmpT (692). The study of the FhuA-
LPS complex (203) revealed the proximity of various acidic
groups of LPS to basic groups on the surface of FhuA. How-
ever, these interactions, which are interpreted as hydrogen
bonding in that paper, are more likely to be ionic interactions
(or salt bridges) in my opinion. My analysis of ionic interac-
tions, based on the Protein Data Bank (PDB) structure 1QFG,
is presented here (Fig. 12). The terminal phosphate and the
secondary phosphate groups in the 1-pyrophosphate moiety of
lipid A interact strongly with the ε-amino groups of Lys441 (2.5
A˚) (the numbering of the residues here and in Fig. 12 is that of
the engineered FhuA, which contains a 11-residue insertion
after Pro405) and Lys439 (3.1 A˚). The 4-phosphate group
interacts strongly with the ε-amino group of Lys351 (2.5 A˚).
The carboxylate group of KDOII interacts tightly with the
guanidinium N of Arg384 (3.0 A˚). Somewhat longer-range
electrostatic interactions are listed in the legend to Fig. 12.
It seems remarkable to me that a weak base (lysine) is used
for tight interactions with the strongly acidic groups of phos-
phate and pyrophosphate whereas a much stronger base (ar-
ginine) is used for weakly acidic groups of KDO. This is likely
to ensure that the nature of the interaction will be ionic, by
protonating the weak base and by deprotonating the weak acid.
Perhaps Mg2 and Ca2 similarly deprotonate KDO and pro-
duce divalent cation bridges in the structure of the LPS leaﬂet,
as was described in the preceding section.
Another interesting feature of this LPS structure is that the
piggybacked fatty acid chains are in a conformation that allows
their methyl ends to be aligned almost exactly with the ends of
630

the 3-OH-myristic acid chains. Also, the plane of GlcN-(-
16)-GlcN disaccharide is strongly tilted in relation to the plane
perpendicular to the direction of the fatty acid chain, as was
predicted by the modeling of the LPS (discussed above). It has
been pointed out that this tilting results from the tight packing
of ordered fatty acid chains. Indeed, the LPS in the FhuA
structure (PDB: 1QFG) contains fatty acid chains in a very
tight association with each other (the distances between the
neighboring hydrocarbon chains are all somewhat below 5 A˚,
as was predicted in the “frozen,” ordered structure); this is
surprising because the LPS hydrocarbons here are not packed
tightly by the presence of neighboring LPS molecules. One
unexpected feature is that the hydrocarbons of this single LPS
molecule are nearly in a single plane (although the 3-OH-
myristate linked to the 3 position was disordered and could not
be modeled), in contrast to the models in which they were
thought to occupy successive planes in a hexagonal lattice, in a
zig-zag fashion (Fig. 11).

Especially in bacteria that have complex life cycles, LPS
structures are modiﬁed in response to the requirement of dif-
ferent environment. One of these adaptation phenomena illus-
trates the importance of the factors presumed to be involved in
the stabilization of LPS leaﬂet (described above). During in-
fection, Salmonella must survive inside mammalian cells, more
speciﬁcally in phagosomes. As we have seen, the OM contain-
ing the “normal” LPS molecules must be stabilized by the
bridging action of divalent cations, Mg2 and Ca2. The con-
centrations of these ions are quite high (millimolar levels) in
serum but are apparently very low (micromolar levels) in
phagocytic vacuoles (215), and this will destabilize the OM.
The low Mg2 concentration may be sensed by the PhoQ
sensor in the cytoplasmic membrane and may cause the acti-
vation, by phosphorylation, of the PhoP regulator (232). The
phosphorylated PhoP (PhoP-P) then activates the transcription
of a number of genes involved in modifying the structure of
LPS (238) (Fig. 13). Recently, cationic antimicrobial peptides
were shown to activate the PhoPQ system (and consequently
the PmrAB system [see below]) in S. enterica serovar Typhi-
murium (27) and also to activate the PmrAB system directly in
P. aeruginosa (411). (The PhoPQ system up-regulates the OM
protease hydrolyzing some cationic peptides [236]; this obser-
vation now appears even more signiﬁcant with the inducing
capacity of these peptides.) (i) PhoP-P activates another two-
component system, pmrAB (see reference 327 for the mecha-
nism), the genes originally identiﬁed as being responsible for
causing moderate resistance to a polycationic antibiotic, poly-
myxin (687). Some of the PmrAB-activated genes (ugd and the
pbgPE operon) code for enzymes needed for the addition of
4-aminoarabinose to the 4-phosphate group on lipid A (96, 97,
237, 668, 669) (Fig. 13). This modiﬁcation decreases the net
charge at this position from about 1.5 to 0 and reduces
electrostatic repulsion between the neighboring LPS mole-
cules. Interestingly, growth of E. coli in the presence of meta-
vanadate (VO3
) produces modiﬁcations in lipid A similar to
the PmrAB-mediated modiﬁcation seen in S. enterica serovar
Typhimurium (783). In some of the lipid A species produced
under these conditions, aminoarabinose is attached to the
1-phosphate rather than to the 4-phosphate (785). (ii) The
PmrAB system also causes the addition of the phosphoetha-
nolamine moiety to lipid A (784), conﬁrming the earlier data
obtained with a polymyxin-resistant mutant (468). An enzyme
catalyzing the transfer of the phosphoethanolamine group has
recently been identiﬁed in N. meningitidis (153). On the basis
of the structure of lipid A produced by the disruption of the
lptA gene (NMB1638), the enzyme appears to add the phos-
phoethanolamine moiety on top of the 4-phosphate and
1-phosphate (and possibly even the 1-pyrophosphate) moieties
of lipid A. If we assume that the primary phosphate ester group
has a formal charge of 1.5 at a neutral pH, as postulated
above, the addition of phosphoethanolamine will decrease the
net charge to 1. In addition, the presence of the positively

FhuA protein. The LPS structure is shown in a ball-and-stick diagram,
with the oxygen atoms in the acidic moieties indicated by large red
balls. A, B, C, D, E, and F refer to the 1-pyrophosphate of GlcNI (the
reducing glucosamine), the 4-phosphate of GlcNII (the nonreducing
glucosamine), KDOI carboxylate, KDOII carboxylate, the HepI 4-py-
rophosphate, and the HepII 4-phosphate, respectively. The amino acid
residues apparently interacting with these anionic groups are shown as
thin green sticks, with the basic nitrogen atoms indicated by blue balls.
The amino acid residues making tight interactions are discussed in the
text. The numbering of residues here is that of the engineered FhuA,
which contains an 11-residue insertion after Pro405. Thus, Lys439 and
Lys441 here correspond to Lys428 and Lys430 of the native FhuA, the
numbering used in Table 1 of reference 203. In addition, the following
residues make somewhat longer-range interactions: Arg382 with the
secondary phosphate of 1-pyrophosphate (4.6 A˚); Lys306 with 4-
phosphate (6 to 7 A˚); Lys351 and Arg384 with KDOI carboxylate (4.7
and 7 A˚); Lys439 with KDOII carboxylate (4.9 A˚); and Arg474 and
Arg435 with HepI 4-pyrophosphate (4.7 and about 10 A˚). The ﬁgure
was drawn with DS Viewer Pro (Accelrys, San Diego Calif.) using PDB
ﬁle 1QFG. In addition to these electrostatic interactions, some amino
acid residues may be involved in H-bonding interactions, which are not
shown.

charged ethanolamine may increase the lateral interaction be-
tween LPS in a more speciﬁc manner. (iii) PhoP-P activates the
transcription of pagP, which codes for an acyl transferase (239).
Although at that time PagP was thought to be an enzyme
located in the inner membrane, subsequent studies (62)
showed it to be an outer membrane protein oriented so that
the active site is close to the interface of the outer leaﬂet (62,
285). This enzyme uses phosphatidylethanolamine as a donor
and transfers palmitate (C16:0) to the OH group of 3-hydroxy-
myristic acid residue linked to position 2 of lipid A (62) (Fig.
13). This increases the number of acyl groups per lipid A
molecule from six to seven. It also is probably important that
the chain of this newly added fatty acid is longer than those
that existed earlier in lipid A. These features are expected to
stabilize the LPS leaﬂet by increasing the hydrophobic and van
der Waals interactions between neighboring LPS molecules.
Perhaps the reported increased resistance to basic peptides
mediated by PagP (239) is an indication of this effect. PagP
homologs from other bacteria have also been studied (508,
553). (iv) Finally, PhoP-P induces the production of LPS con-
taining the 2-OH-myristic acid residue as a piggyback fatty acyl
chain connected to the 3-OH-myristic acid residue at the 3-
position (238) (Fig. 13). This modiﬁcation is done by convert-
ing the myristic acid residue in the LPS into the 2-OH acid by
an oxygenase encoded by lpxO (221). This compensates for the
decrease in the number of OH groups caused by the PagP-
catalyzed reaction and again maintains the LPS leaﬂet in a
stable state by maintaining the number of H-bond donors, such
as the OH group, at the same level. The authors also speculate
that 2-OH-myristate, released inside the host cell, may inhibit
the signal transduction pathway by acting as an inhibitor of
protein myristoyl transferase (221). In any case, we can see that
all four modiﬁcations of lipid A are in the direction of in-
creased stabilization of LPS leaﬂet in the Mg2-poor environ-
ment of phagosomes. In fact, by measuring the permeability of
the OM to a large, lipophilic probe, we have shown that in a
low-Mg2 medium, the PhoP-constitutive strain producing
fully modiﬁed lipid A is more successful in preventing the entry
of the probe than is the PhoP-defective S. enterica serovar
Typhimurium producing unmodiﬁed lipid A (W. W. Tseng, T.
Guina, S. H. Miller, and H. Nikaido, unpublished data). An-
other PhoPQ-regulated gene product, PagL, was shown to
remove the 3-OH-myristic acid residue at the 3 position (667).
However, this modiﬁcation was observed only under condi-
tions of PagL overproduction from the cloned gene and has
not been observed in normal cells. Possibly this enzyme is
needed for minor adjustments of the structure of the LPS
leaﬂet after the addition of the seventh fatty acid residue.
FIG. 13. Adaptative changes in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium lipid A structure in response to a low-Mg2 environment. Alterations are
highlighted in boldface, and the enzymes involved (LpxO, PagP, and PmrAB-regulated enzymes of 5-aminoarabinose addition) are indicated by
large type. LpxO generates the (S)-2-hydroxymyristate moiety, as shown. Stereochemistry was not indicated for most of the other asymmetric
centers shown in Fig. 9. An additional modiﬁcation of lipid A induced by PmrAB is the addition of phosphoethanolamine on 1-phosphate, as
discussed in the text.

There are probably additional PhoPQ-regulated modiﬁca-
tions of the LPS structure that contributes to the stabilization
of OM. For example, the LPS of pmrAB-constitutive mutants
of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium and E. coli contains more
of its heptose-pyrophosphate moiety capped by ethanolamine
(264, 468). The gene (lpt-3) responsible for the addition of the
phosphoethanolamine moiety to a heptose residue in the core
region of N. meningitidis was identiﬁed (392); it is a homolog of
the lptA gene involved in the addition of the phosphoethanol-
amine to lipid A, described above. Schnaitman and Klena
(594) reported that a tolC mutant of E. coli produced a similar
LPS, with an increased content of pyrophosphorylethanol-
amine. The connection suggested between this LPS alteration
and the drug hypersensitivity of the tolC mutants (594) is
unlikely to be correct, now that we know the contribution of
TolC to active drug efﬂux (450). However, there is an interest-
ing possibility that E. coli cells suffering from the accumulation
of toxic chemicals due to the absence of TolC produce this
modiﬁed LPS through a regulatory pathway that could include
PhoPQ-PmrAB.
A somewhat similar modiﬁcation of lipid A occurs in P.
aeruginosa strains infecting the airways of cystic ﬁbrosis pa-
tients (195). First, as an environmental microorganism, P.
aeruginosa has a lipid A that contains somewhat shorter fatty
acids than does E. coli or Salmonella lipid A (see below); thus,
at positions 2 and 2, the 3-OH-myristate (C14:0) of the latter
species are replaced by 3-OH-laurate (C12:0), positions 3 and 3
are substituted by 3-OH-decanoate (C10:0), and, ﬁnally 2-OH-
laurate, rather than myristate and laurate, is present as the
piggybacking fatty acyl residues (357). Interestingly, these pig-
gyback substitutions occur symmetrically on fatty acids linked
to the 2 and 2 positions (357) rather than on those linked to
the 2 and 3 positions as in Salmonella lipid A (compare Fig.
14B with Fig. 14A). The substituent at the 3 position is often
deacylated, producing a penta-acyl species (357). Therefore, as
if to compensate for the decreased van der Waals intermolec-
ular interaction due to the shorter (and sometimes smaller
number of) fatty acid chains, the total number of free OH
groups is increased from two or three in the E. coli and Sal-
monella lipid A to ﬁve (or even six in the penta-acyl form) in P.
aeruginosa, greatly increasing the possibility of stabilization of
the LPS leaﬂet through H bonding. Interestingly, in P. aerugi-
nosa isolated from infants suffering from cystic ﬁbrosis (i.e., in
the early phase of the disease), the lipid A structure is modiﬁed
(i) by the addition of a 5-aminoarabinose residue(s) and (ii) by
the addition of C16:0 as a piggyback residue to the 3-OH-
decanoate residue linked to the 3 position (195). (Also, one of
the piggyback fatty acids was laurate instead of 2-OH-laurate.)
These modiﬁcations are reminiscent of the PhoPQ-induced
modiﬁcation in Salmonella discussed above, although the pal-
mitoylation occurs at a different position in the latter system.
(The P. aeruginosa genome does not appear to contain a close
homolog of pagP.) In fact, the PhoPQ system was shown to
cause this palmitoylation reaction in P. aeruginosa in response
to low Mg2 concentrations in the medium (195). Since P.
aeruginosa strains from cystic ﬁbrosis patients produced lipid A
of this PhoPQ-modiﬁed type even when cultured on Mg2-
sufﬁcient laboratory media, it is likely that these isolates have
accumulated a mutation(s) leading to the production of such a
lipid A, which is likely to be beneﬁcial to the bacteria in this
environment. It is difﬁcult to imagine that the airway exudate
contains only micromolar concentrations of Mg2; possible
advantages might involve resistance to cationic peptides, for
example.
What would happen under conditions that are the opposite
of those inducing the PhoPQ response, that is, an excess of
divalent cations, especially Ca2? Ca2, because of its dehy-
drating effect, is known to strongly increase the rigidity of the
lipid bilayer. In bilayers containing large amounts of acidic
lipids, millimolar levels of Ca2 raises the melting temperature
of the membrane interior by many tens of degrees (481). LPS
is obviously a strongly acidic lipid, and OM “freezes” in high
concentrations of Ca2, apparently producing cracks that allow
the entry of DNA in transformation (139) and that of large
proteins in the periplasmic reconstitution procedure (108).
Very interestingly, the laboratory of Raetz discovered that
millimolar levels of Ca2 in the medium induce an enzyme that
transfers the phosphoethanolamine group from phosphati-
dylethanolamine to one of the KDO residues in LPS (320).
Possibly this zwitterionic group prevents the binding of Ca2 to
the high-afﬁnity binding sites nearby, but the cation-binding
properties of such modiﬁed LPS remain to be studied.
A recent study illustrates the effect of the total number of
acyl chains in lipid A on the stability of the OM (435). Lipid A
is synthesized in E. coli and Salmonella by the transfer of four
3-OH-myristoyl residues to the 2, 3, 2, and 3 positions to
produce lipid IVA, then by the transfer of two KDO residues,
and ﬁnally by the transfer of two piggyback acyl chains, C12:0 to
the 2-linked 3-OH-myristoyl residue by HtrB and C14:0 to the
3-linked 3-OH-myristoyl residue by MsbB (528). Mutants with
mutations of msbB gene were hitherto thought to be without
phenotype, but Murray et al. (435) found that the mutant could
not grow in Luria-Bertani broth without NaCl even though it
grew slowly in the same medium with NaCl and grew almost as
fast as the parent strain in Luria-Bertani broth containing 2
mM Mg2 and Ca2. Apparently, with one fewer acyl chain,
the van der Waals interaction between the neighboring LPS
molecules cannot compensate for the electrostatic repulsion,
which becomes more pronounced in the lower-ionic-strength
environment of the NaCl-free medium. The repulsion, obvi-
ously, can be minimized by an excess of divalent cations.
In a different system, pathogenic Y. enterocolitica, growth in
an acidic pH or in EGTA-containing media decreased the
degree of acylation of LPS, thereby increasing the ﬂuidity of
the OM (48). The molecular mechanism of this regulation is
not known.
As if to avoid the excessive “freezing” of lipids, the acyl
substitutents in lipid A are usually shorter than in phospholip-
ids. In E. coli or Salmonella, most chains are C14, with one C12
acid. That the chain length is relevant to the regulation of
viscosity is seen from the observation that when Salmonella
cells are grown at low temperatures (12°C), there is now an
incorporation of monounsaturated fatty acid (cis-9-C16:1), ap-
parently at the expense of C12:0 (744). The molecular mecha-
nism of this modiﬁcation is now known (117); low temperature
induces the synthesis of a new acyl transferase, LpxP, cata-
lyzing the transfer of palmitoleate (cis-9-C16:1). The mutant in
which the lpxP gene was inactivated grows at 12° C but is
hypersusceptible to a large (nearly 1,500-Das); rather hydro-
philic antibiotic, vancomycin (702), a result suggesting that an

excessively rigid LPS interior produces a brittle OM that is
unstable and undergoes transient breakage events. In a psy-
chrophilic Pseudomonas syringae strain that was grown at 4°C,
lipid A somewhat unexpectedly showed a decrease in the con-
tent of unsaturated palmitoleate, and this was compensated by
strong increases in 3-OH-C10 and 3-OH-C12 acids (361). This
could be because hydrophobic interactions become weak at
these low temperatures and therefore must be replaced by
intermolecular H bonding to maintain the LPS leaﬂet in a
stable form.
Interaction with the host cells is also expected to produce
modiﬁcations of the more highly exposed O-chain portion of
the LPS. These changes are presumably more closely related to
the interaction of bacterial cell surface with host components
and are outside the scope of this review. One particularly
well-characterized example is cited, however. When Rhizobium
etli infects the roots of its host plants, it alters the structure of
the O-antigen chain of its LPS. Outside the host plants, the
chains are “capped” by an exceedingly lipophilic sugar residue,
a tri-O-methyl-6-deoxyhexose, which must play a major role in
the contact of bacterial cell with the environment; remarkably,
this capping residue appears to become lost in the plant envi-
ronment (184).
Different Lipid A Structures in Various Organisms
Length, number, and position of fatty acyl groups. In the
prototype lipid A of the Enterobacteriaceae, the 2, 3, 2, and 3
positions of the backbone disaccharide are all substituted by
3-hydroxymyristic acid (3-OH-C14:0). In many other bacteria,
however, fatty acyl groups at these positions are either shorter
or longer (see Table 4 of reference 735). In many cases, these
differences can be rationalized as a feature of adaptation to the
particular habitat of the species. For example, all four of these
positions are substituted by a much shorter acid, 3-OH-C10:0 in
both Rhodocyclus gelatinosus and Sphaerotilus natans, both of
which are aquatic organisms presumably adapted for life at
lower temperatures. As described above, P. aeruginosa, which
is basically an environmental saprophyte, also contains shorter
fatty acids in its lipid A than does E. coli. It was also mentioned
that, as if to compensate for the decreased intermolecular
hydrophobic interactions due to the shorter fatty acid chains,
P. aeruginosa lipid A contains larger numbers of free OH
groups (Fig. 14B), which should increase H-bonding interac-
tions between neighboring lipid A molecules. In contrast to
these environmental organisms, in H. pylori, which lives sym-
biotically in the stomach of higher animals (and thus exists at
temperatures around 37°C), these positions contain two 3-OH-
C16:0 and two 3-OH-C18:0 residues. Temperature adaptation
therefore seems to play a major role in the length of fatty acids.
In the classical E. coli lipid A, the substitution of the 3-OH
groups of 3-OH-C14:0 occurs in an asymmetric manner, with
only the residues linked to the nonreducing glucosamine resi-
due becoming substituted in the piggyback manner; therefore,
two and four hydrocarbon chains are connected to the reduc-
ing and nonreducing sugar residues, respectively (Fig. 14A). In
contrast, lipid A from N. gonorrhoeae is acylated in a symmet-
rical manner, with both sugar residues carrying three hydro-
carbon chains (645). This difference in the positions of the acyl
chains, however, cannot be the cause of the presumed high
permeability of the neisserial OM, because P. aeruginosa,
whose OM bilayer is at least as impermeable as that of Salmo-
nella (503), produces lipid A that also has the symmetrical
pattern of acylation (735) (Fig. 14B). The lipid A of N. men-
ingitidis is known to carry pyrophosphorylethanolamine substi-
tutents at both the 1 and 4 positions (356), and the possibility
remains that this may be related to the production of a highly
permeable bilayer.
An unusual acyl group, 27-OH-C28:0, was ﬁrst found in Rhi-
zobium leguminosarum lipid A in 1991 (59). The enzymatic
mechanism of the addition of this fatty acid has been clariﬁed
(39, 102). From its length and the presence of the hydroxyl
group at the other end of the chain, it has been hypothesized
that this fatty acid traverses the entire thickness of OM. Ob-
viously this substituent is likely to stabilize the OM structure.
Its presence is sometimes thought to be related to the life
within eukaryotic cells, since it occurs in bacteria belonging to
the -2 subgroup of proteobacteria, which includes many such
symbionts and pathogens such as Brucella and Bartonella, in
addition to Rhizobium (57). However, this fatty acid is also
found in many free-living members of the -2 subgroup, in-
cluding Rhodopseudomonas and Nitrobacter (57). When the
gene coding for the special acyl carrier protein used for the
synthesis of this long-chain fatty acid is inactivated, the mutant
cells grow normally in the laboratory but are hypersensitive to
deoxycholate (608) and to hyperosmotic or acidic conditions
(696).
The average number of fatty acid substituents per molecule
of lipid A is usually close to the number observed in the
Enterobacteriaceae, i.e., about six. Signiﬁcant deviation is seen
in the lipid A of Porphyromonas gingivalis (Fig. 14C). In one
strain, both the 3 and 3 positions were unsubstituted and the
lipid contained only three fatty acid residues (473). This was
rather surprising, but in a later study a single strain was shown
to produce a heterogeneous mixture of lipid A, ranging from
diacyl to penta-acyl compounds (358). Furthermore, the acyl
chains are rather long, with the amide-linked chains, for ex-
ample, being terminally branched 3-OH-C17, a feature that
may help in stabilizing the bilayer in spite of the smaller num-
bers of acyl chains. Interestingly, in both studies phosphate
substitution at the 4 position was found to be absent or very
incomplete (see also below); the presence of fewer hydrocar-
bon chains may be compensated for by the decreased electro-
static repulsion between neighboring lipid A molecules.

Groups at the ends of the disaccharide backbone. As men-
tioned above, both ends of the disaccharide (1 and 4 posi-
tions) are usually phosphorylated (and the 1 position is often
pyrophosphorylated) in E. coli and Salmonella; this contributes
several negative charges to lipid A. In Mg2-poor environ-
ments, PmrAB-regulated genes add a positively charged 4-ami-
noarabinose to the 4-phosphate, thus decreasing the net
charge (Fig. 13), as described above. This modiﬁcation is ap-
parently constitutive in Proteus spp., for example (735). This is
the reason why Proteus is intrinsically resistant to the polyca-
tionic agent polymyxin B, but it can probably be better under-
stood as an adaptation of this organism to the aquatic habitat
(with low divalent-cation levels).
Among organisms outside the Enterobacteriaceae, many or-
ganisms, especially aquatic ones like R. capsulatus, Rhodocyclus
gelatinosus, and S. natans, contain lower net negative charges in
lipid A (Table 2). This would decrease the electrostatic repul-
sion between neighboring LPS molecules in a divalent-cation-
poor environment, a useful feature for aquatic dwellers. Inter-
estingly, N. meningitidis lipid A also has a lower net negative
charge (Table 2), and this is probably the cause of its excep-
tionally high intrinsic resistance to polymyxin B (728).
B. fragilis and Porphyromonas LPS lack phosphorylation at
the 4 position, as mentioned above. In Rhodomicrobium
vanielli, another aquatic organism, the 1 and 4 positions are
not phosphorylated, so that the backbone is totally devoid of
negative charge. In addition, the 4 position carries a mannose
substituent in most cases (409). It will be of interest to study
the structure of the inner core of this LPS, particularly the
presence and distribution of charged residues. Similar, non-
phosphorylated lipid A has also been isolated from Selenomo-
nas ruminantium cells pretreated with hot 5% trichloroacetic
acid (315); in this case, however, at least the 1-phosphate group
could have been split off by the acid pretreatment.
Interestingly, lipid A from R. leguminosarum does not con-
tain any phosphoryl substituents, and 2-amino-2-deoxygluconic
acid and galacturonic acid now supply the negative charges
contributed by the 1- and 4-phosphates in the classical struc-
ture (Fig. 14D) (58). (2-Amino-2-deoxygluconic acid is gener-
ated by an oxidase located in the outer membrane [521, 522].)
In the closely related R. etli, even the core region is devoid of
phosphoryl substituents and the negative charges are provided
by uronic acids and KDO (207). This may give an ecological
advantage to this organism in phosphorus-poor environment.
Carboxylates could also become protonated more easily and
may help the survival of these organisms in an environment
poor in the bridging divalent cations by decreasing the repul-
sion between neighboring LPS molecules.

(GlcN3N). In 1975, Roppel et al. (557) found that some Rho-
dopseudomonas species produced lipid A containing GlcN3N
rather than glucosamine. The list of bacteria producing lipid A
with this feature has grown signiﬁcantly (735) since then and
now includes not only -2 proteobacteria (Rhodopseudomonas,
Nitrobacter, Thiobacillus novellus, Phenylobacterium, Bradyrhi-
zobium, Brucella, etc.) but also some -proteobacteria (Chro-
matium, Thiocapsa, Thiocystis, and Legionella) and ε-proteobac-
teria (Campylobacter jejuni). In -2 proteobacteria, GlcN3N
appears to be essentially the only sugar component of lipid A,
but in others glucosamine and GlcN3N often seem to coexist.
An example of the latter type, LPS from Rhodospirillum sali-
narium was studied in some detail (532). Conversion of the
usual ester linkage at the 3 and 3 positions into amide linkages
creates two NH groups, which may function as additional H-
bond donors to increase the lateral interaction between LPS
molecules. Many of these bacteria are indeed environmental
aquatic organisms that may need this feature in divalent-cat-
ion-poor environment. Phosphate groups are absent in many
species, including Rhodopseudomonas palustris, R. viridis, Ni-
trobacter, Phenylobacterium immobile, Bradyrhizobium, Chro-
matium, Thiocapsa, and Thiocystis (see Table 7 of reference
735), and this feature will increase the lateral interaction fur-
ther by decreasing electrostatic repulsion. Another character-
istic feature of the -2 proteobacteria is that their lipid A very
often contains 27-OH-C28:0 (mentioned above), another fea-
ture that would stabilize the OM structure.
In R. viridis and P. immobile (and possibly in some others),
the backbone is a GlcN3N monosaccharide and the phosphate
groups are entirely absent (409) (Fig. 14E). This decreases
drastically the number of hydrocarbon chains per molecule and
the hydrophobic lateral interaction between LPS molecules: in
these cases, the increased intermolecular interaction through
H bonding and the drastically decreased electrostatic repulsion
due to the absence of phosphate groups may be needed for the
construction of an effective permeability barrier.
Extractable Lipids Substituting for or Supplementing LPS
LPS is known to be present in most gram-negative bacteria.
However, among spirochetes, T. pallidum and B. burgdorferi
lack LPS, in contrast to Leptospira, which produces LPS with O
antigens (109). The absence of LPS in Sphingomonas is de-
scribed below. Furthermore, in contrast to enteric bacteria,
mutations abolishing lipid A biosynthesis are not lethal in
Neisseria species (631, 632), as long as capsular polysaccharide
is produced.
In some groups of bacteria, there are characteristic lipids
that occur in the OM either in addition to or in place of LPS.
(Reference 736 provides a comprehensive review of lipids of
gram-negative bacteria, with more than 1,000 references up to
1987.) These special lipids include sphingolipids, sulfonolipids,
and ornithine lipids (Fig. 15).
Sphingolipids. This review has already mentioned that gly-
cosphingolipids have many features in common with LPS. In-
deed, glycosphingolipids replace all of the LPS in Sphingomo-
nas paucimobilis (330). In all strains of Sphingomonas and
related genera examined, glycosphingolipids were abundant
(646); these lipids contain not only the OH group in the sphin-
gosine base but also 2-OH or 3-OH fatty acid substituents, and
these are expected to form an extensive H-bonding network
with neighboring lipid molecules, especially with the OH
groups in the sugar head groups. The head groups of Sphin-
gomonas sphingolipids usually contain sugar acids, such as D-
glucuronic acid (330) (Fig. 15, left) or D-galacturonic acid
(437), although in some cases the negative charge is neutral-
ized by the presence of an amino sugar (330). The presence of
sphingolipids instead of LPS in the OM may produce a more
ﬂexible and pliable structure, and this may be related to the
utilization of polymers, such as polyethylene glycol and algi-
nate, by these bacteria (329, 427). In fact, unusual structures
(called mouth-like pits) have been reported on the surface of
alginate-utilizing Sphingomonas spp. (427). Asymmetric bilay-
ers were reconstituted in vitro in which one leaﬂet consisted
exclusively of a sphingolipid from S. paucimobilis, containing a
monosaccharide as the carbohydrate component (731). The
hydrocarbon chains appeared to be more rigidly packed, and
the phase transition occurred in the range of 10 to 40°C, far
higher than the temperature at which phospholipid transition
is observed. Thus, the experimental data are in agreement with
the hypothesis that glycosphingolipid and LPS leaﬂets behave
in a similar manner in terms of physical chemistry.
Sphingolipids are also known to be a major component of
lipids in Bacteroides, Porphyromonas, and Sphingobacterium
species (736). In these cases also, the amide-linked fatty acids
are often 3-OH acids, and in some species the hydroxy fatty
acids constitute up to 43% of the fatty acids of extractable
lipids. However, these lipids usually occur either as ceramides
(N-acylsphingosines) (423, 753) or as sphingophospholipids
(736), and because of the absence of sugars in the head group
the lateral interaction through H bonding is expected to be
weaker than in Sphingomonas. In fact, in contrast to Sphin-
gomonas, the Bacteroides OM does contain LPS (87, 359, 473,
712, 713), and the observation that sphingolipids can comprise
up to one-half of the total lipids in Bacteroides (736) suggests
that they also form a signiﬁcant fraction of the inner mem-
brane lipids.
Sulfonolipids. Sulfonolipids are found characteristically in
the Cytophaga-Flexibacter group (224) and are located mainly
in the OM (225). These lipids are N-acyl derivatives of 2-ami-
no-3-hydroxy-15-methyl-hexadecane-1-sulfonic acid, and most
of the acyl groups are also hydroxylated at the 3 position
(sometimes at the 2 position) (226) (Fig. 15, center). This is
reminiscent of the structures of lipid A and sphingolipids, in
that they all contain hydroxyl groups as well as an amide NH
group(s), all of which are potential donors of H bonds, near the
hydrophilic-hydrophobic interface. As with LPS and hexuronic
acid-containing glycosphingolipids, these lipids also add nega-
tive charges to the external surface of the OM.
The more ﬂuid bilayer produced by the presence of sulfono-
lipids may be essential for the rapidly gliding motility of these
organisms, which appears to involve the rapid lateral move-
ment of OM components (410). Sulfonolipid-deﬁcient mutants
of Flavobacterium johnsoniae (formerly Cytophaga johnsonae)
indeed lack gliding motility (2). Interestingly, when F. johnsoniae
is grown on a solid surface, the composition of the acyl sub-
stituent in the sulfonolipid becomes altered. Instead of the
mixture of 3-OH acids and nonhydroxylated acids found in
cells grown in liquid media, cells grown on solid surfaces con-
tain either 2-OH acids or 2,3-dihydroxy acids (1) (Fig. 15,
VOL. 67, 2003

center). This may be an adaptation for better gliding motility,
but it is possible that the increased H bonding through the use
of these substituents is needed on solid media, where nega-
tively charged surfaces of neighboring cells are in close contact
with each other and a better stabilization of OM becomes
necessary. The latter interpretation is supported by a similar
observation on the modiﬁcation of S. enterica serovar Typhi-
murium LPS. Defects in the ugd gene and the pbgPE operon,
which are needed for the decrease of the net negative charge
on lipid A (through the addition of 4-aminoarabinose [237];
see “Physiological adaptation in LPS structure” above), hin-
ders the growth of mutants on solid, low-Mg2 medium but not
in liquid medium (629); presumably the increased net negative
charge of LPS in the absence of divalent cations hinders
growth more strongly in colonies, where the surfaces of neigh-
boring cells contact each other.
Ornithine lipids. Three different classes of ornithine-con-
taining lipids are known to exist in bacteria (227). Here we
discuss only one type, in which one 3- (or 2-)hydroxy fatty acid
is linked through an amide linkage to the -amino group of
ornithine and the second fatty acid is linked to the hydroxyl
group of the ﬁrst fatty acid via an ester linkage (Fig. 15, right),
the piggyback conﬁguration found in the lipid A. These lipids
occur in many bacteria (736) and were shown to be present
predominantly in the OM in Paracoccus denitriﬁcans (734). In
relation to the possible lateral interaction of these lipids, it is
interesting that the majority of the ester-linked fatty acids
become hydroxy fatty acids in B. cepacia when grown at a
higher temperature (40°C) (650). Furthermore, F. johnsoniae
contains ornithine lipids in addition to the OM sulfonolipids,
and in a sulfonolipid-deﬁcient mutant strain the content of
ornithine lipid increases (500).
These observations suggest that the OM of relatively low
permeability can be constructed by using lipids with a high
capacity for lateral H-bond interactions, including LPS, glyco-
sphingolipids, sulfonolipids, and ornithine lipids. It is not clear
what advantages could be gained by the use of the smaller
lipids, but perhaps it is reasonable to assume that one can
obtain higher ﬂexibility at the possible cost of somewhat low-
ered barrier capacity. The extremely high susceptibility of P.
denitriﬁcans to lipophilic agents (733) is indeed consistent with
the latter assumption, although we do not know anything about
the active efﬂux of drugs in this organism. Perhaps the avail-
ability of these “LPS substitutes” also gives bacteria the ability
to survive in an environment that is unfavorable for the pro-
duction and stabilization of LPS monolayers. Thus, P. denitri-
ﬁcans, when grown in complex media containing a low concen-
tration of divalent cations, a condition that would destabilize
the OM due to electrostatic repulsion between the highly
acidic LPS molecules, produces more of the zwitterionic orni-
thine lipids, possibly to substitute for LPS (711).
Alterations of the OM Bilayer Barrier
Effect of energy state. In the previous version of this review
(464), a section (“Potential dynamic ﬂuctuations in structure”)
was devoted to the curious observation that the deenergization
of the inner membrane somehow drastically increased the ap-
parent permeability of the outer membrane. This mystery has
now been completely solved. We now know that the inﬂux of
lipophilic compounds into gram-negative bacterial cells is lim-
ited not only by the OM permeability barrier but also by their
active efﬂux by ubiquitous, “multidrug” efﬂux pumps, which are
usually energized by the proton motive force (450). Thus, in
these earlier experiments, the deenergization was inhibiting
the active-efﬂux process. Entry of the lipophilic compounds
across the OM is a slow process (504) but is much faster than
was previously thought (see, for example, reference 451).
However, there is one area of OM organization that appears
to require an energized inner membrane. I have already men-
tioned that TolQ-TolR-TolA (Fig. 5), a system homologous to
ExbB-ExbD-TonB, is involved in the import of the A group
colicins. TolQ (with three transmembrane helices like ExbB)
and TolR (with one transmembrane helix like ExbD) are hy-
pothesized to energize the largely periplasmic TolA protein for
this process. Unlike TonB, which interacts with the Ton-box-
containing OM receptors, the C-terminal domain of TolA in-
teracts with a periplasmic protein, TolB, or the OM lipoprotein
PAL (384). Defects in any of the TolQR-TolB system compo-
nents result in profound functional problems with the OM
barrier, increasing drastically the formation of OM vesicles
(see below), causing periplasmic proteins (such as RNase and
-lactamase) to leak out of the cell, and making the cells
hypersusceptible to various noxious agents (367). The hyper-
susceptibility pattern is interesting in that it includes not only
lipophilic agents expected to traverse the OM bilayer (such as
SDS and cholate) (367) but also vancomycin (119), which is
large but hydrophilic, so that it does not cross the OM unless
large, supramolecular defects open up. The known interaction
between the TolB periplasmic protein and PAL (86) and be-
tween PAL and peptidoglycan through the peptidoglycan-
binding motif of the PAL (118, 173) suggests that the TolQR-
TolB system, through PAL and other OM proteins, somehow
stabilizes the OM organization in an energy-dependent man-
ner (367, 384). Indeed, overproduction of PAL stabilizes the
OM in mutants lacking the Braun lipoprotein (118), suppress-
ing their OM-leaky phenotype, which is very reminiscent of
that of the mutants with mutations of the TolQR-TolB system.
However, 7 
 105 copies of the Braun lipoprotein are sup-
posed to exist in a single cell, in contrast to a few thousand
copies of PAL (118). It is unclear why so many fewer PAL and
the associated TolQR-TolB system proteins are capable of
stabilizing the OM-peptidoglycan complex. The X-ray crystal-
lographic structure of TolB (3), which includes an N-terminal
/ domain connected to a C-terminal -propeller domain,
gives an interesting hint. Here it was suggested that the ho-
mology of the C-terminal domain to oligopeptide peptidases
and also metallo--lactamase may mean that TolB, together
with PAL (which, unlike the Braun lipoprotein, interacts non-
covalently with the peptidoglycan and therefore can move to
different places in the peptidoglycan network), reorganizes the
OM-peptidoglycan complex by local hydrolysis of the pepti-
doglycan and religation of the Braun lipoprotein with a new
site in the peptidoglycan. The TolA and TolQ proteins were
also reported to be needed for the export of the O-antigen
portion of LPS (216); it is not known if this is a direct effect or
a consequence of the destabilization of the OM in mutants
defective in the Tol system.
Perturbation of the OM permeability barrier. As discussed
in detail above, the LPS-containing outer leaﬂet of OM slows

considerably the spontaneous permeation of lipophilic solutes
across the asymmetric bilayer of the OM. However, this rela-
tively impermeable bilayer can be perturbed to produce a
higher permeability. There are two ways to achieve this per-
turbation of the barrier: mutational alteration of the LPS struc-
ture and the use of drugs that bind to the bilayer and perturb
its organization. The LPS mutants include the so-called deep
rough mutants, which produce a very defective R core and
have been studied extensively. The mutants with a complete R
core (Ra LPS) (see Fig. 10 for the structure of the R core) or
the mutants with a core deﬁcient only in the galactose and
N-acetylglucosamine moieties (Rb LPS) produce an essentially
unaltered barrier. Those with a core containing only one glu-
cose residue (Rc LPS) may or may not produce a permeable
OM, depending on the species. Defects in any earlier steps of
biosynthesis, resulting in LPS containing only KDO residues or
KDO plus one or two heptose residues, show a typical deep
rough phenotype with increased permeability to lipophilic an-
tibiotics and inhibitors. In the previous version of this review
(464), we concluded that the cause of this phenotype was not
the increased permeability of the deep rough LPS per se but
was the decreased incorporation of OM proteins in the pres-
ence of these defective LPS molecules, a situation that pro-
duces an OM bilayer with patches of phospholipid bilayers.
Such glycerophospholipid bilayers have been experimentally
observed in the OM of deep rough mutants (316). Further-
more, deep rough LPS was shown to be less capable of assisting
the folding, insertion, and trimerization of porins (165, 602).
The crucial structure for this function of LPS appears to be the
presence of the phosphate substituent on HepII (Fig. 10) (464).
It is interesting that this is the only anionic group that does not
interact with basic groups of the FhuA protein in the structure
of FhuA-LPS complex (Fig. 12). Other lines of evidence that
either support or contradict the phospholipid bilayer concept
are described above (see “General structure of LPS”). The
literature on deep rough mutants up to 1993 has been lucidly
summarized by the coauthor of the previous version of this
review, Martti Vaara (685). One of the important observations
cited in that review is that a leaky mutation in lpxA, which
codes for the ﬁrst enzyme of lipid A biosynthesis, produces a
phenotype that is far more hypersusceptible to many agents
than are the classical deep rough strains. I am not aware of
studies of the quantitative composition of the OM outer leaﬂet
in the lpxA strain.
The second method for perturbing the OM bilayer to in-
crease its permeability has again been discussed critically by
Vaara (684). To summarize, polycationic agents are the clas-
sical compounds that permeabilize the OM bilayer. One point
that should be emphasized is that the initial electrostatic in-
teraction between a polycationic agent and the polyanionic
surface of the LPS leaﬂet shows an enormous dependence on
the ionic strength. Using the Debye-Hu¨ckel theory, one can
predict that the interaction between a pentavalent cation and a
pentavalent anionic (small) section of the OM will increase
2,000-fold if the ionic environment is changed from 0.1 M
NaCl (mimicking physiological conditions in the human body)
to 10 mM HEPES-Na buffer (pH 7.5) (455). Thus, one should
always ask if an agent loses its activity as a result of the addition
of 0.1 M NaCl. If it does, then it is very unlikely to increase the
permeability of OM in the human bloodstream or tissue ﬂuids.
As summarized by Vaara (684), polymyxin B (a cyclic pep-
tide with a net positive charge of 4 and a fatty acid tail) is an
exceptionally powerful OM perturbant, presumably because of
the optimal spatial distribution of the charges. Polymyxin B
produces a large defect in the LPS/phospholipid asymmetric
bilayer assembled in vitro (730), partly through its detergent-
like capacity mediated by the fatty acid tail, and then damages
the inner membrane. A recent study using intact cells (160)
also conﬁrmed that modest concentrations of polymyxin B
rapidly increase the OM permeability to such lipophilic com-
pounds as tetraphenylphosphonium and phenyldicarbaunde-
caborane. PMBN is devoid of the fatty acid tail and produces
OM permeabilization without killing gram-negative cells (684).
The involvement of anionic groups of LPS in the action of
polymyxin B is clear from the fact that lipid A of polymyxin
B-resistant mutants of Salmonella contains 5-aminoarabinose
substituents, which neutralize one of the negative charges on
lipid A (see “Physiological adaptation in LPS structure”
above). The interaction between polymyxin B and lipid A was
characterized by NMR (512). The solution structure of poly-
myxin B is altered signiﬁcantly on binding of polymyxin B to
lipid A, and modeling suggests that one antibiotic molecule
may bind to one lipid A head group primarily through elec-
trostatic interactions. Interestingly, the side chains of the two
hydrophobic amino acid residues in polymyxin B (Phe6 and
Leu7) are inserted into the hydrocarbon interior of lipid A in
this model; this would explain the OM-permeabilizing effect of
PMBN, which lacks the fatty acyl tail. A recent study showed
that replacing Phe6 with tyrosine or replacing Leu7 with ala-
nine resulted in a compound with weaker OM-permealizing
activity (679), a result consistent with this hypothesis. We
should not, however, rely too heavily on the one-to-one stoi-
chiometry model of the polymyxin B-lipid A interaction, be-
cause the use of synthetic lipid A analogs with shorter or no
acyl chains showed the stoichiometry of less than 1 (average,
0.64) polymyxin B molecule per lipid A molecule (761); the
authors suggest that the predominant binding mode of poly-
myxin B may be the one that straddles two lipid A molecules.
One note of caution is that the synthetic lipid A preparations
used lacked the piggyback acyl residues or 3-hydroxyl groups
on acyl substituents, and these features could have affected the
results. In any case, this study provides a welcome new direc-
tion, because most other studies concentrated on polymyxin B,
and what happens to the conformation of lipid A has not been
pursued so far, although one reference indicates that its hy-
drocarbon interior becomes much more ﬂuid, without giving
detailed data (340).
Many cationic peptides of animal origin (such as defensins)
have been claimed, at low concentrations, to produce perme-
abilization of the outer membrane. However, many of these
experiments were carried out by using buffers of exceptionally
low ionic strength. Indeed, some of these compounds work
presumably within specialized animal cells and were optimized
to exert their action only at very high concentrations. In con-
trast, BPI from the azurophilic granules of polymorphonuclear
leukocytes binds LPS very tightly, with KD values in the micro-
molar range (684). BPI has since been shown to bind to the in
vitro-reconstituted LPS-phospholipid bilayer and to cause ri-
gidiﬁcation of LPS followed by membrane rupture (729). The
structural aspect of interaction between LPS and proteins in-

----- Page 48 (native) -----
cluding BPI is discussed in “Conformation of LPS in the LPS-
FhuA complex” above.
Aminoglycosides, which are polycationic, were proposed to
traverse the OM of P. aeruginosa by perturbing the bilayer just
as polymyxin does (“self-promoted uptake” hypothesis). This
pathway is likely to be signiﬁcant in P. aeruginosa, which has a
porin of exceptionally low permeability (see “Slow porins”
above). Aminoglycosides were also reported to cause general
permeabilization of the OM bilayer (250). However, these
experiments were done under the extremely artiﬁcial condi-
tions of using 5 mM HEPES buffer, and the addition of 0.15 M
NaCl completely abolished the permeabilization. It is there-
fore necessary to conclude that the effect would be insigniﬁcant
in human body ﬂuids.
Because the LPS-containing outer leaﬂet is stabilized by the
bridging actions of divalent cations (see “Strong lateral inter-
actions between LPS molecules” above), removal of these cat-
ions by chelators such as EDTA destabilizes this leaﬂet, result-
ing in the release of a large fraction of LPS into the medium,
as shown by the pioneering study by Leive (371). This presum-
ably results in the consequent migration of glycerophospholip-
ids from the inner leaﬂet to the outer leaﬂet, producing, in the
OM, glycerophospholipid bilayer domains, which allow the
rapid permeation of lipophilic inhibitors (464). As discussed by
Vaara (684), divalent cations can also be removed by other
agents.
OM Vesicles
Gram-negative cells have been known since the 1960s to
“bleb off” vesicles of the OM (for a review, see reference 56).
Because strong electrostatic repulsion may develop between
neighboring LPS molecules and because LPS molecules may
assemble in nonbilayer forms under certain conditions (for
example, see reference 604), the formation of blebs with strong
curvature is not a complete surprise. These vesicles contain
LPS and some periplasmic enzymes (56). More surprisingly,
vesicles from some species contain DNA, and vesicle-mediated
transformation has been reported (754).
The vesicles, however, have not been carefully characterized
in detail in most studies. For example, the reported protein
composition of vesicles from P. aeruginosa (312) is strikingly
different from that of the OM, yet little attention has been paid
to this observation. An exception is studies by Horstman and
Kuehn (277, 278), which suggest a signiﬁcant role for OM
vesicles for the secretion of E. coli heat-labile toxin. Here the
vesicles were shown to be enriched in monomeric OM pro-
teins, OmpA, OmpX, and OmpW, but to contain less of the
trimeric porins OmpF and OmpC. The two major protein
bands that are strongly enriched in vesicles, at about 45,000
and 30,000 Da, remain unidentiﬁed, however. Despite much
work, it is still unclear whether the production of these vesicles
is a catalyzed, active process or the simple consequence of OM
instability.
EPILOGUE
When I began writing this review almost 2 years ago, I
intended to use, as a motto, a fragment of a poem by the
earliest known Greek lyric poet Archilochus (early seventh
century B.C.), which says, “A fox knows many things, but a
hedgehog one great thing.” Since this is a fragment, it is not
absolutely clear what the poet intended to say, but most people
think that the poet was comparing himself to the hedgehog.
Having worked in the ﬁeld of OM for 30 years, I thought I
knew a lot about this one ﬁeld, just like the hedgehog of
Archilochus. But during the writing of this review, I learned
how little I knew in this area, and this was a humbling and
sobering experience. I am certain that I have made many mis-
takes due to my ignorance, and I hope that the review will be
useful despite its many faults.

ADDENDUM IN PROOF
The cAMP-dependent expression of OmpD in S. enterica
serovar Typhimurium (mentioned in “Other porins”) was re-
cently rediscovered (C. A. Santiviago, C. S. Toro, A. A.
Hidalgo, P. Youderian, and G. C. Mora, J. Bacteriol. 185:
5901–5905, 2003).
As regards the structure of LPS (discussed in “General
structure of LPS”), additional and fairly recent reviews exist on
the structure of lipid A (U. Za¨hringer, B. Lindner, and E.
Rietschel, p. 93–114, in H. Brade, S. M. Opal, S. N. Vogel, and
D. C. Morrison, ed., Endotoxin in Health and Disease, 1999), on
the structure of core (O. Holst, p. 115–154, in Endotoxin in
Health and Disease), and on the structure of O-polysaccharide
chains (P.-E. Jansson, p. 155–178, in Endotoxin in Health and
Disease).
