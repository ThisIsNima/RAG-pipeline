Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne ﬂ avivirus ﬁ rst 
isolated in Uganda from a sentinel monkey in 1947. Mos-
quito and sentinel animal surveillance studies have dem-
onstrated that ZIKV is endemic to Africa and Southeast 
Asia, yet reported human cases are rare with <10 cases 
reported in the literature. In June 2007, an epidemic of fe-
ver and rash associated with ZIKV was detected in Yap 
State, Federated States of Micronesia. We report the ge-
netic and serologic properties of the ZIKV associated with 
this epidemic.
Z
ika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted virus in the 
family Flaviviridae and genus Flavivirus. It was ini-
tially isolated in 1947 from blood of a febrile sentinel rhe-
sus monkey during a yellow fever study in the Zika forest 
of Uganda (1). The virus was subsequently isolated from 
a pool of Aedes africanus mosquitoes collected in 1948 
from the same region of the Zika forest; a serologic survey 
conducted at that time showed that 6.1% of the residents 
in nearby regions of Uganda had speciﬁ c antibodies to 
ZIKV (1,2). 
Over the next 20 years, several ZIKV isolates were 
obtained from Aedes spp. in Africa (Ae. africanus) and 
Malaysia (Ae. aegypti), implicating these species as likely 
epidemic or enzootic vectors (3–5). Several ZIKV human 
isolates were also obtained in the 1960s and 1970s from 
East and West Africa during routine arbovirus surveillance 
studies in the absence of epidemics (6–8). Additional se-
rologic studies in the 1950s and 1960s detected ZIKV in-
fections among humans in Egypt, Nigeria, Uganda, India, 
Malaysia, Indonesia, Pakistan, Thailand, North Vietnam, 
and the Philippines (5). These data strongly suggest wide-
spread occurrence of ZIKV from Africa to Southeast Asia 
west and north of the Wallace line. 
In 1977, ZIKV infection was conﬁ rmed among 7 pa-
tients in central Java, Indonesia, during an acute fever study 
(9). Data on these 7 ZIKV cases and several previously re-
ported human infections indicated that clinical characteris-
tics of infection with ZIKV included fever, headache, mal-
aise, stomach ache, dizziness, anorexia, and maculopapular 
rash; in all cases infection appeared relatively mild, self-
limiting, and nonlethal (6,8–10).
In April 2007, an epidemic of rash, conjunctivitis, and 
arthralgia was noted by physicians in Yap State, Federated 
States of Micronesia (11). Laboratory testing with a rapid 
assay suggested that a dengue virus (DENV) was the caus-
ative agent. In June 2007, samples were sent for conﬁ rma-
tory testing to the Arbovirus Diagnostic Laboratory at the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, Fort 
Collins, CO, USA). Serologic testing by immunoglobu-
lin (Ig) M–capture ELISA with DENV antigen conﬁ rmed 
recent ﬂ avivirus infection in several patients. Testing by 
reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR) with ﬂ avivirus con-
sensus primers generated DNA fragments, which when 
subjected to nucleic acid sequencing, demonstrated ≈90% 
nucleotide identity with ZIKV. These ﬁ ndings indicated 
that ZIKV was the causative agent of the Yap epidemic.

Methods
Analysis of Patient Samples
Details of the epidemic, including clinical and labo-
ratory ﬁ ndings for all patients, will be reported elsewhere 
(M.R. Duffy et al., unpub. data). A subset of ZIKV-infected 
patients for whom acute- and convalescent-phase paired 
serum specimens had been collected was analyzed by us-
ing several serologic assays to evaluate the extent of cross-
reactivity to several related ﬂ aviviruses. Patients were 
classiﬁ ed as primary ﬂ avivirus/ZIKV infected or second-
ary ﬂ avivirus/ZIKV probable infected. Primary ﬂ avivirus/
ZIKV–infected patients were those in whom acute-phase 
serum specimens (<10 days) had no detectible antibodies 
(by IgG ELISA and plaque reduction neutralization test 
[PRNT]) to any of the heterologous ﬂ aviviruses tested 
(Tables 1, 2) and were either IgM-positive in their acute-
phase specimen or IgM and IgG positive for ZIKV in a 
convalescent-phase specimen (seroconversion). Secondary 
ﬂ avivirus/ZIKV probable–infected patients were those who 
had detectable antibodies to >1 heterologous ﬂ aviviruses in 
their acute-phase specimen and were also IgM positive for 
ZIKV in their acute-phase specimen, or IgM and IgG posi-
tive for ZIKV in their convalescent-phase specimen. The 
designation “ZIKV probable” was used because secondary 
ﬂ avivirus infections demonstrate extensive cross-reactivity 
with other ﬂ aviviruses, and in some cases, higher serologic 
reactivity to the original infecting ﬂ avivirus (“original an-
tigenic sin” phenomenon). Thus, in secondary ﬂ avivirus 
infections shown in Tables 1 and 2, serologic data alone is 
insufﬁ cient to conﬁ rm ZIKV as the recently infecting ﬂ a-
vivirus. However, these secondary ﬂ avivirus/ZIKV prob-
able infections were likely recent ZIKV infections because 
ZIKV was the only virus detected during the epidemic in 
Yap, a relatively small and isolated island (11).
Serologic Testing
Acute- and convalescent-phase serum samples were 
tested by IgG ELISA with ZIKV antigen as described for 
detection of IgG to arboviruses (12). Samples were also 
tested by IgM ELISA as described with the following vi-
ral antigens: ZIKV, DENV 1–4 mixture, yellow fever vi-
rus (YFV), Japanese encephalitis virus, and Murray Valley 
encephalitis virus (13). Testing for IgM to West Nile virus 
(WNV) and St. Louis encephalitis virus was performed 
by using a microsphere immunoassay (14). Ratios of

patient optical density values to negative control values 
(P/Ns) were calculated for IgG and IgM ELISAs. Values >3 
were considered positive, and values 2–3 were considered 
equivocal. Neutralizing antibody titers were determined by 
using a PRNT with a 90% cut-off value (15).
Real-Time RT-PCR
Two real-time primer/probe sets speciﬁ c for the ZIKV 
2007 strain were designed by using ZIKV 2007 nucleotide 
sequence data in the PrimerExpress software package (Ap-
plied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Primers were 
synthesized by Operon Biotechnologies (Huntsville, AL, 
USA) with 5-FAM as the reporter dye for the probe (Ta-
ble 3). All real-time assays were performed by using the 
QuantiTect Probe RT-PCR Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, 
USA) with ampliﬁ cation in the iCycler instrument (Bio-
Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s 
protocol. Speciﬁ city of the ZIKV primers was evaluated 
by testing the following viral RNAs, all of which yielded 
negative results: DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4, 
WNV, St. Louis encephalitis virus, YFV, Powassan virus, 
Semliki Forest virus, o’nyong-nyong virus, chikungunya 
virus, and Spondweni virus (SPOV). 
Sensitivity of the ZIKV real-time assay was evaluated 
by testing dilutions of known copy numbers of an RNA 
transcript copy of the ZIKV 2007 sequence. Copy numbers 
of RNA were determined by using the Ribogreen RNA-
speciﬁ c Quantitiation Kit (Invitrogen) and the TBE-380

Zika Virus in Yap State, Micronesia, 2007
mini-ﬂ uorometer (Turner Biosystems, Sunnyvale, CA, 
USA). RNA transcripts ranging from 16,000 to 0.2 cop-
ies were tested in quadruplicate to determine the sensitiv-
ity limit and to construct a standard curve for estimating 
the genome copy number of ZIKV in patient samples. All 
serum samples obtained during the epidemic were tested 
for ZIKV RNA by using this newly designed real-time RT-
PCR. Concentration of viral RNA (copies/milliliter) was 
estimated in ZIKV-positive patients by using the standard 
curve calculated by the iCycler instrument (Table 4). All 
RT-PCR–positive specimens were placed on monolayers 
of Vero, LLC-MK2, and C6/36 cells to isolate virus; no 
specimens showed virus replication.
Nucleic Acid Sequencing and Phylogenetic Analysis
RNA was extracted from patient samples that demon-
strated the highest concentration of ZIKV RNA determined 
by the real-time assay, and for which sufﬁ cient sample 
volume was available (patients 824, 037, 830a, and 958). 
Brieﬂ y, RNA was extracted from 150 μL of serum by us-
ing the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN), and RNA 
was eluted with 75 μL of RNase-free water. A series of RT-
PCRs was performed with each RNA preparation by using 
primer pairs designed to generate overlapping DNA frag-
ments that spanned the entire polyprotein coding region of 
the virus. Primers were designed by using the ZIKV MR 
766 prototype virus coding region sequence (GenBank 
accession no. AY632535) and the PrimerSelect software 
module of the LaserGene package (DNASTAR Inc., Madi-
son, WI, USA). Several primers initially failed to amplify 
because of sequence mismatches between ZIKV MR 766 
and ZIKV Yap 2007. Therefore, primers were redesigned 
by using newly generated DNA sequence data, and a “ge-
nome walking” approach was used to derive complete cod-
ing region sequence data. The complete list of ampliﬁ ca-
tion and sequencing primers is available upon request. 
All RT-PCRs were performed with 10 μL of RNA 
by using the OneStep RT-PCR Kit (QIAGEN) following 
the manufacturer’s protocol. DNAs were analyzed by 2% 
agarose gel electrophoresis, and bands of the predicted 
size were excised from the gel and puriﬁ ed by using the 
QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN). Puriﬁ ed DNAs 
were subjected to nucleic acid sequence analysis with se-
quencing primers spaced ≈500 bases apart on both strands 
of the DNA fragments by using the ABI BigDye Termina-
tor V3.1 Ready Reaction Cycle Sequencing Mixture (Ap-
plied Biosystems). Nucleotide sequence was determined 
by capillary electrophoresis by using the ABI 3130 genetic 
analyzer (Applied Biosystems) following the manufactur-
er’s protcol. Raw sequence data were aligned and edited 
by using the SeqMan module of LaserGene (DNASTAR 
Inc.). Because of insufﬁ cient sample volume, no patient 
RNA was sufﬁ cient to generate DNA that included the en-
tire coding region. Therefore, DNA data obtained from 4 
patients was combined to generate a consensus sequence 
heretofore designated the ZIKV 2007 epidemic consensus 
(EC) sequence (GenBank accession no. EU545988).
The complete coding region of ZIKV 2007 EC or the 
nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) gene subregion was aligned 
with all available ﬂ avivirus sequences in GenBank by us-
ing the Clustal W algorithm within the MEGA version 4 
software package (www.megasoftware.net). Phylogenetic 
trees were constructed by using either the complete cod-
ing region or the NS5 region because a large number of 
NS5 sequences were available in GenBank and trees for the 
NS5 region have been constructed (16). Additional ZIKV 
strains from the CDC/World Health Organization reference 
collection (strains 41662, 41524, and 41525) isolated from 
Aedes spp. mosquitoes collected in Senegal in 1984 were 
also ampliﬁ ed by RT-PCR in the NS5 region and subjected 
to nucleic acid sequencing as described above and included 
in the NS5 region analysis. Trees were constructed from 
coding region data or from NS5 data by MEGA 4 from 
aligned nucleotide sequences. We used maximum parsi-
mony, neighbor-joining, or minimum evolution algorithms 
with 2,000 replicates for bootstrap support of tree group-
ings. All trees generated nearly identical topology; only the 
neighbor-joining NS5 tree is shown (Figure 1).

IgM and PRNTs of all acute- and convalescent-phase 
paired specimens obtained during the epidemic. Specimens 
were divided into primary and secondary infections on the 
basis of antibody testing results of acute-phase specimens. 
IgM antibody response in primary ﬂ avivirus/ZIKV–infect-
ed patients was speciﬁ c for ZIKV. However, all of these 
patients showed some limited degree of cross-reactivity 
with heterologous ﬂ aviviruses. Patient 830a showed IgM-
positive results with DENV and Japanese encephalitis 
virus, whereas all patients showed equivocal results (P/N 
2–3) with several of the ﬂ aviviruses tested, suggesting low 
levels of cross-reactivity. PRNT90 results also showed that 
the neutralizing antibody response among primary ﬂ avivi-
rus/ZIKV–infected patients was highly speciﬁ c. Most con-
valescent-phase PRNT titers for heterologous ﬂ aviviruses 
were negative and rarely exceeded 10 (20 in 1 instance; 
patient 849b). 
Most patient specimens from the Yap epidemic tested 
were secondary ﬂ avirius infections as determined by cri-
teria described for antibody to ﬂ avivirus in acute-phase 
specimens. A subset of these patients for whom acute- and 
convalescent-phase specimens were available was tested 
for reactivity against heterologous ﬂ aviviruses; results are 
shown in Tables 1 and 2. In contrast to primary ﬂ avivirus/
ZIKV–infected patients, secondary ﬂ avivirus–infected pa-
tients showed a high degree of serologic cross-reactivity 
with other ﬂ aviviruses. Six of 7 patients were positive for 
IgM against >1 of the heterologous ﬂ aviviruses tested, and 
all demonstrated low levels of cross-reactive IgM as shown 
by a P/N value in the equivocal range. PRNT90 results 
showed that among secondary ﬂ avivirus/ZIKV–probable 
patients, the neutralizing antibody response was higher to 
ZIKV and more cross-reactive, a ﬁ nding commonly ob-
served among secondary ﬂ avivirus infections. A >4-fold 
PRNT90 titer between ZIKV and heterologous ﬂ aviviruses 
was observed in only 3 of the 7 patients. In all other cases, 
the PRNT difference between ZIKV and other ﬂ aviviruses 
tested was <2-fold; in 2 patients (817b and 844b) the PRNT 
titer was higher for 1 of the heterologous ﬂ aviviruses. The 
PRNT result for the acute-phase specimen from patient 
847 suggests previous vaccination with YFV. The conva-
lescent-phase specimen from patient 847 showed a high 
titer to YFV, a demonstration of the previously described 
“original antigenic sin” phenomenon observed among ﬂ a-
viviruses (17).
Real-Time RT-PCR
A real-time RT-PCR was developed by using newly 
derived sequence data obtained from several ZIKV-infect-
ed patients. All acute-phase specimens obtained during the 
Yap epidemic (n = 157) were tested in this assay with 2 
unique primer/probe sets. Seventeen samples were posi-
tive, 10 were equivocal, and 130 were negative (data not 
shown). The equivocal designation indicates that a par-
ticular sample was positive by only 1 of the 2 primer sets 
or showed crossing thresholds >38.5, which suggests ei-
ther a false-positive result or a sample with low levels of 
ZIKV RNA below the deﬁ ned cut-off of the assay. Table 
4 shows estimated viral concentrations of the 17 ZIKV-

positive specimens. The viral RNA concentrations were 
≈900–729,000 copies/mL. Most (15 of 17) of the ZIKV-
positive samples were from specimens collected <3 days 
after onset; however, 1 specimen (patient 958) collected on 
day 11 after onset was positive with an estimated titer of 
≈339,000 copies/mL.
Nucleic Acid Sequence and Phylogenetic Analysis
Several RT-PCR–positive serum specimens were se-
lected, and RNA was ampliﬁ ed by RT-PCR to generate 
DNA sequence data for the complete coding region. Be-
cause of limited specimen volume, the complete coding 
region genome sequence was only obtainable by combin-
ing sequence data from DNA fragments generated from 4 
patients. Thus, the designation EC sequence is used to in-
dicate that the sequence was derived from multiple patients 
during the epidemic. The exact contribution of sequence 
data from each patient is available upon request. However, 
the following points should be noted. Approximately 96% 
of the complete coding region was obtained from 3 patients; 
sequence data from the fourth patient was used primarily to 
ﬁ ll in short gaps in the data. Second, ≈50% of the coding re-
gion data was derived from a complete overlap of data from 
>2 patients; in these overlap regions the sequence identity 
between different patients was ≈100%. Only 2-nt differ-
ences between patients were noted within the overlapping 
regions, strongly suggesting that 1 ZIKV strain circulated 
during the epidemic.
Percentage identity over the entire coding region of 
ZIKV 2007 EC sequence, when compared with the pro-
totype ZIKV (MR 766, isolated in 1947), was 88.9% and 
96.5% at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. 
Phylogenetic trees constructed from the complete coding 
region of all available ﬂ aviviruses generated by a variety of 
methods (neighbor-joining, maximum-parsimony, or min-
imum-evolution) showed the same overall topology, with 
the ZIKV prototype and 2007 EC virus placed in a unique 
clade (clade 10) within the mosquito-borne ﬂ avivirus clus-
ter previously described by Kuno et al. (16). Alignment 
with phylogenetic tree construction by neighbor-joining, 
maximum-parsimony, or minimum-evolution algorithms 
was also performed for the NS5 region of all available ﬂ a-
viviruses because extensive sequencing and phylogenetic 
analysis have been conducted for this region (16). 
Three additional ZIKV strains isolated from Senegal 
in 1984 and sequenced in this study were also included in 
a tree. This NS5 tree demonstrated similar topology to the 
complete coding region tree, with all ZIKVs placed within 
a unique clade (clade 10) along with SPOV. Figure 1 shows 
the NS5 tree with only mosquito-borne ﬂ aviviruses (clus-
ter) displayed. This NS5 tree also shows that within the 
Zika/Spondweni clade there appear to be 3 branches among 
ZIKVs: Nigerian ZIKVs, prototype MR766, and 2007 Yap 
virus. Percentage identity among these ZIKVs conﬁ rms 
the tree topology, in which ZIKV 2007 EC is most distally 
related to East and West African ZIKV strains (data not 
shown).
The predicted amino acid sequence of ZIKV 2007 EC 
contains the Asn-X-Ser/Thr glycosylation motif at posi-
tion 154 in the envelope glycoprotein, found in many ﬂ a-
viviruses, yet absent by deletion in the prototype ZIKV 
MR 766. This region of the prototype virus, along with 
3 ZIKVs isolated from Senegal in 1984, was sequenced 
(Figure 2). Included in this alignment is a ZIKV isolate 
from GenBank (accession no. AF372422). Sequencing 
conﬁ rmed that prototype ZIKV MR766 has a 4-aa (12-nt) 
deletion when compared with ZIKV 2007 EC virus and 
ZIKVs from Senegal.
Discussion
Historically, ZIKV has rarely been associated with hu-
man disease, with only 1 small cluster of human cases in 
Indonesia reported (9). We report a widespread epidemic 
of human disease associated with ZIKV in Yap State in 
2007. ZIKV epidemics may have occurred but been mis-
diagnosed as dengue because of similar clinical symptoms 
and serologic cross-reactivity with DENVs. Our serologic 
data indicate that ZIKV-infected patients can be positive 
in an IgM assay for DENVs, particularly if ZIKV is a sec-
ondary ﬂ avivirus infection. If ZIKV is the ﬁ rst ﬂ avivirus 
encountered, our data indicate that cross-reactivity is mini-
mal. However, when ZIKV infection occurs after a ﬂ avi-
virus infection, our data indicate that the extent of cross-
reactivity in the IgM assay is greater. Therefore, if ZIKV 
infections occur in a population with DENV (or other ﬂ a-
vivirus) background immunity, our data suggest that exten-
sive cross-reactivity in the dengue IgM assay will occur, 
which could lead to the erroneous conclusion that dengue 
caused the epidemic. Whether this cross-reactivity has oc-
curred is open to speculation. However, reexamination of 
specimens from dengue epidemics may provide an answer. 
In addition, use of virus isolation or RT-PCR for labora-
tory diagnosis of dengue infections would also prevent this 
misinterpretation. Therefore, use of virus detection assays

in dengue epidemics should be a component of laboratory 
testing algorithms.
Levels of viremia among ZIKV-infected patients were 
relatively low. Unfortunately, measurement of concentra-
tion of infectious ZIKV was not possible because a virus 
isolate was not obtained from any patient during the epi-
demic. Absence of a ZIKV 2007 isolate also precluded use 
of a ZIKV 2007 isolate to generate a standard curve in the 
RT-PCR, which in turn could have estimated the concen-
tration of infectious virus within patients. An estimation of 
the number of genome copies circulating in ZIKV-infected 
patients was calculated by using an RNA transcript and 
provides some indication of infectious virus concentration 
in ZIKV-infected patients. If one assumes a ratio range 
of 200–500 genome copies per infectious virus particle, a 
range reported for several ﬂ aviviruses, then the copies/mil-
liliter values in Table 4 would be in the range of ≈2–3,500 
infectious virus particles/mL, with only 4 specimens in 
which ZIKV exceeded 1,000 infectious units/mL (18,19). 
These ﬁ ndings may partially explain why ZIKV was not 
isolated, especially if one considers that shipping samples 
to our laboratory took ≈1 week, and shipping conditions 
were not conducive to virus isolation. These concentration 
estimates are also consistent with those of a study in which 
a ZIKV-infected human volunteer showed low viremia; vi-
rus was isolated only on day 4, and the volunteer was un-
able to infect Ae. aegypti mosquitoes that fed on the patient 
during the acute stage of disease (10).
Although generation of a complete coding region 
nucleic acid sequence by using a combination of patient 
samples from the epidemic is an unconventional approach, 
it was performed out of necessity because of limited vol-
umes of patient samples. However, the extent of agreement 
among overlapping regions conﬁ rms that the sequence ob-
tained accurately represents the virus associated with the 
epidemic. Nucleic acid sequence of ZIKV 2007 showed 
divergence (11%) from the prototype strain (MR766) iso-
lated in 1947. However, the predicted amino acid sequence 
is fairly conserved (96%), which is likely the result of the 
selective pressure maintained on the virus because replica-
tion occurs in vertebrate hosts and arthropod vectors.
Phylogenetic trees based on the complete coding re-
gion or the NS5 region conﬁ rm results of a study in which 
ZIKV was classiﬁ ed in a unique clade among the mosquito-
borne ﬂ aviviruses and most closely related to SPOV (16). 
The NS5 mosquito-borne ﬂ avivirus tree (Figure 1), which 
includes additional ZIKV isolates, conﬁ rms these relation-
ships and suggests that there are 3 subclades among ZIKV 
isolates that reﬂ ect geographic origin. Senegal ZIKVs and 
prototype virus from Uganda may represent West and East 
African lineages, respectively. The 2007 ZIKV is distantly 
related to these 2 African subclades and may represent di-
vergence from a common ancestor with spread throughout 
Southeast Asia and the Paciﬁ c. Human ZIKV cases were 
detected in peninsular Malaysia in 1980, which conﬁ rms 
that ZIKV was active in this region before 2007 (9). Addi-
tional sequence analysis of other temporally and geograph-
ically distinct ZIKV strains is needed to further elucidate 
relationships among these viruses.
Of particular interest is an additional 12 nt in the enve-
lope gene (corresponding to 4 aa) in our ZIKV isolate that 
were not present in the ZIKV prototype virus (Figure 2). 
This difference is noteworthy because these 4 aa correspond 
to the envelope protein 154 glycosylation motif found in 
many ﬂ aviviruses and associated in some instances with 
virulence. This glycosylation motif is also absent because of 
a 6-aa deletion in the ZIKV isolate obtained from GenBank 
(accession no. AF372422); however, the geographic and 
temporal origins of this virus were not available. Loss of the 
envelope protein 154 glycoslyation site has been observed 
in some ﬂ aviviruses, and in the case of Kunjin virus has 
been shown to occur during passage. However, with Kun-
jin virus, the glycosylation site motif was lost because of a 
1-base mutation, rather than a deletion, that altered the N-
X-S/T sequon (20). Loss of this glycosylation site by a 4-aa 
deletion has also been observed in several lineage-2 WNV 
strains when compared with all other WNV strains (21). 
The glycoslyation motif in WNV may be lost during 
extensive mouse brain passage; however, no direct evi-
dence exists to support this hypothesis (21). This process 
may occur in ZIKV; the glycoslyation motif in MR 766 may 
have been present in earlier passages of prototype MR766 
and lost during extensive mouse brain passage. However, 
earlier passage strains of MR766 were not available for 
investigating this hypothesis. Alternatively, the presence 
or absence of this glycosylation motif may represent an 
ancient evolutionary event with subsequent divergence 
of 2 ZIKV types with or without the E-154 glycosylation 
site amino acids. Sequence data derived from 3 additional 
ZIKV isolates from Senegal showed that glycosylation is 
intact in these isolates, which suggests evolutionary di-
vergence. More extensive sequence analysis of available 
ZIKV strains of various temporal, geographic, and passage 
histories may provide some insight into this issue.
