SUMMARY
Natural ﬂood plains are among the most biologically
productive and diverse ecosystems on earth. Globally,
riverine ﬂood plains cover  2  106 km2, however,
they are among the most threatened ecosystems.
Floodplain degradation is closely linked to the rapid
decline in freshwater biodiversity; the main reasons
for the latter being habitat alteration, ﬂow and ﬂood
control, species invasion and pollution. In Europe and
North America, up to 90% of ﬂood plains are already
‘cultivated’ and therefore functionally extinct. In the
developing world, the remaining natural ﬂood plains
are disappearing at an accelerating rate, primarily as
a result of changing hydrology. Up to the 2025 time
horizon, the future increase of human population will
lead to further degradation of riparian areas, intensiﬁ-
cation of the hydrological cycle, increase in the
discharge of pollutants, and further proliferation of
species invasions. In the near future, the most threat-
ened ﬂood plains will be those in south-east Asia,
Sahelian Africa and North America. There is an
urgent need to preserve existing, intact ﬂood plain
rivers as strategic global resources and to begin to
restore hydrologic dynamics, sediment transport and
riparian vegetation to those rivers that retain some
level of ecological integrity. Otherwise, dramatic
extinctions of aquatic and riparian species and of
ecosystem services are faced within the next few
decades.

INTRODUCTION
Riverine ﬂood plains are among the Earth’s most distinctive
landscape features. In the natural state they are characterized
by high biodiversity and productivity, and corresponding
recreational and aesthetic values. Flood plains are of great
cultural and economic importance; early civilizations arose in
fertile ﬂood plains and throughout history people have
learned to cultivate and use their rich resources. Riverine
ﬂood plains have also served as focal points for urban devel-
opment and exploitation of their natural functions. 
Several comprehensive books on ﬂood plains have been
published during the last 20 years, including monographs on
the Pongolo ﬂood plain (South Africa; Heeg & Bren 1982),
the Hadejia-Nguru ﬂood plain (Nigeria; Hollis et al. 1993),
the Gearagh (a small anastomosing river in Ireland; Brown
et al. 1995), the Luznice (a small meandering river-ﬂoodplain
system in the Czech Republic; Prach et al. 1996), the Amazon
(South America; Junk 1997), the Pantanal (South America;
Heckman 1998), Czech ﬂood plains and the effects of water
management (Penka et al. 1985, 1991) and British ﬂood plains
(Bailey et al. 1998). Further, there are textbooks on ﬂoodplain
ﬁsheries (Welcomme 1975, 1979), on forested wetlands
including ﬂood plains (Lugo et al. 1990) on ﬂoodplain
processes (Anderson et al. 1996), on the geomorphology of
lowland rivers (Carling & Petts 1992), on macroinvertebrates
in North American ﬂood plains and wetlands (Batzer et al.
1999), on biodiversity in wetlands and ﬂood plains (Gopal
et al. 2000, 2002), on wetland ecology and management
(Mitsch & Gosselink 2000), on European ﬂoodplain forests
(Klimo & Hager 2001), and on the restoration of river-
ﬂoodplain systems (Middleton 1999; Smits et al. 2000).
Flood plains, with an estimated global extent ranging from
0.8  106 km2 to 2  106 km2 (Mitsch & Gosselink 2000;
Ramsar & IUCN [World Conservation Union] 1999) repre-
sent a primary wetland type that will deserve increased
attention as a key global resource in the near future. This
review is seen therefore as a necessary and overdue summary
on riverine ﬂood plains that complements reviews on other
continental wetlands. Brinson and Malvaréz (2002) review
the status of temperate wetlands and Junk (2002) treats
subtropical and tropical wetlands in a more general way.
Moore (2002) focuses on cool temperate bogs, while
Malmqvist and Rundle (2002) review the state of rivers, and
Williams (2002) summarizes the present and future state of
inland saline water bodies. 
The present review provides an overview on the actual
extent of riverine ﬂood plains, the major economic and
ecological services they provide, and the multifaceted threats
that make them to one of the most endangered landscapes
worldwide. Further, we discuss their changing ecological
status and ﬁnally we predict the conditions of ﬂood plains

in the year 2025 (see Foundation for Environmental
Conservation 2001) under different scenarios of conserva-
tion/exploitation. 
Since 
ﬂood 
plains, 
wetlands 
and
freshwater systems are not always clearly distinguished in the
published literature, general examples on fresh waters or
wetlands are included in the present review if necessary. 
Deﬁnition and classiﬁcation of ﬂood plains
Flood plains are deﬁned as ‘areas of low lying land that are
subject to inundation by lateral overﬂow water from rivers or
lakes with which they are associated’ ( Junk & Welcomme
1990). This deﬁnition includes fringing ﬂood plains of lakes
and rivers, internal deltas and the deltaic ﬂood plains of estu-
aries. Brinson (1990) and Brinson and Malvaréz (2002)
proposed a hydrogeomorphic classiﬁcation of wetlands that is
based on the (1) geomorphic setting, (2) water source, and (3)
hydrodynamics. Considering these components, riverine
ﬂood plains are located on low-gradient alluvial ‘shelves’;
water sources are primarily from lateral overspill of river
water, although other sources may also contribute to ﬂood-
plain inundation; and, although primarily unidirectional,
water ﬂow is characterized by highly complex, multidimen-
sional exchange pathways. Four sources of water are
recognized as contributing to ﬂoodplain inundation: lateral
overﬂow, groundwater, upland sources and direct precipi-
tation. Flood plains can be solely fed by rainfall such as the
Flooding Pampa grasslands in Argentina (Perelmann et al.
2001); however, several sources normally contribute to inun-
dation (Tockner et al. 2000a). 
As riparian zones, ﬂood plains are usually deﬁned as
ecotones between terrestrial and aquatic realms (Gregory
et al. 1991; Malanson 1993) that extend from the low-water
mark to the high-water line and also include the terrestrial
vegetation inﬂuenced by elevated groundwater tables or
extreme ﬂoods (Nilsson & Berggren 2000; Naiman et al.
2000). In practice, there are several transition zones, and
riverine ﬂood plains may contain a complex of different
wetland types. 
Flood plains develop in all geographic regions and at
different locations along river corridors (e.g. Tockner et al.
2000a,b). For streams in the USA, the estimated average
ﬂoodplain width ranges from 3 m for small rivers to about
1 km for the largest rivers (Table 1). Total ﬂoodplain area (all
stream segments combined) is similar across different stream
orders (Table 1). Riverine corridors are often composed of
ﬂood plains sequentially arrayed between canyons or bedrock
constrained segments from the headwaters to the ocean. The
ﬂoodplain segments can be as large as 90 000 km2 as for the
Nile River (Sudd, Sudan), although they range mostly from
tens to hundreds of ha in small and medium-sized rivers
(Stanford & Ward 1993). Along large tropical rivers such as
the Amazon, the Orinoco or the Magdalena, average ﬂood-
plain widths are 32 km, 9 km and 35 km, respectively
(Hamilton & Lewis 1990). The immense area that natural
ﬂood plains may cover is demonstrated by the Fly River
(Papua New Guinea), one of the largest intact ﬂoodplain
rivers in Australasia; 60% of the 76 500 km2 catchment area
becomes seasonally inundated, and the average ﬂoodplain
width of the lower 800 km is more than 40 km (Swales et al.
1999).
Flood plains are centres of biodiversity and
bioproduction
Flood plains are considered as centres of biocomplexity and
bioproduction although this has never been rigorously tested
in a regional landscape context (e.g. Megonigal et al. 1997).
Indeed, more species of plants and animals by far occur on
ﬂood plains than in any other landscape unit in most regions
of the world. In the Paciﬁc coastal ecoregion (USA), for
example, approximately 29% of wildlife species found in
riparian forests are riparian obligates (ranging from 12% of
mammals to 60% of amphibians; Kelsey & West 1998).
Although  1% of the landscape of the western USA
supports riparian vegetation, this vegetation provides habitat
for more species of breeding birds than any other vegetation
association. For example, of all bird species breeding in
northern Colorado, 82% occur in riparian vegetation, and
about half of south-western species depend upon riparian
vegetation (Knopf & Samson 1994). Riparian areas in semi-
arid zones are also critical in providing stopover areas for en
route migrants (acting as ‘dispersal ﬁlters’), and therefore
affect the breeding success of northern bird populations
(Skagen et al. 1998). In tropical Asia, many nominally terres-
trial mammals are associated with riverine wetlands for part
of their life cycle, including important representatives of the
‘charismatic megafauna’ (e.g. Malayan tapir, Indian rhino;
Dudgeon 2000a,b). However, the biodiversity associated with
rivers and streams has been neglected in most areas of the
world such as Asia or Africa. For example, the Mekong River
contains 500 known ﬁsh species, although perhaps 1200 are
expected (Dudgeon 2000a,b). A signiﬁcant proportion of this

diverse ﬁsh fauna depends on the rich resources provided by
intact ﬂood plains. 
In Europe, 30% of threatened bird species are inland
wetland-dependent species and 69% of the important
breeding areas for birds contain wetland habitats, primarily
ﬂood plains (Tiker & Evans 1997). In Switzerland, 10% of
the entire fauna is restricted in its occurrence to riverine ﬂood
plains, although ﬂood plains only cover 0.26% of the
country’s surface. Moreover, 28% of the fauna frequently
uses ﬂood plains and about 44% is occasionally found in ﬂood
plains (Table 2). In total, about 80% of the fauna occurs in
riverine ﬂood plains. A high proportion of the riparian oblig-
ates (47%) is listed as endangered, compared to 28% for the
entire fauna (Walter et al. 1998). 
Flood plains are important centres of biological diversiﬁ-
cation. Fittkau and Reiss (1983) assumed that riverine ﬂood
plains belong to those aquatic ecosystems where biota of
lentic areas (standing water bodies) started their evolution.
The temporal continuity of riverine systems and their associ-
ated disturbance regime allowed the permanent presence of
lentic and semi-lentic water bodies throughout time. The
speciation of groundwater crustaceans is also supposed to be
favoured by the lateral shifting of river channels that lead to
the isolation of former connected channels (e.g. cyclopoid
copepods in the alluvial aquifer of the Danube; P. Pospisil,
personal communication 1996). 
Flood plains are among the most productive landscapes on
Earth, owing to continual enrichment by import and reten-
tion of nutrient-rich sediments from the headwaters and
from lateral sources, and they are more productive than the
parent river and adjacent uplands. Net primary production in
riparian forests ranges between 750 and 1370 g m2 yr1
(mean: c. 1000 g m2 yr1; Mitsch & Gosselink 2000). The
production of wetland/ﬂoodplain animals is probably
9.0 g m2 yr1, which is 3.5 times the value for terrestrial
ecosystems (Turner 1982, cited in Keddy 2000). Production
depends on hydrology. In Virginia ﬂood plains (USA),
aquatic invertebrate production ranges between 1.1 and
6.12 g m2 yr1, with highest values in the most dynamic
segments (Gladden & Smock 1990). Rivers derive nearly all
their ﬁsh productivity from ﬂood plains (e.g. Welcomme
1979; Bayley 1988). There is a positive correlation between
ﬁsh catch and the maximum inundated ﬂoodplain area in
African rivers, with ﬁsh yield being most inﬂuenced by the
ﬂood state in previous years (Welcomme 1975, 1979). The so
called ‘ﬂood-pulse advantage’ (sensu Bayley 1995) was recog-
nized by the ancient Egyptians, since taxes were based on the
extent of the annual ﬂood of the Nile. On a worldwide basis,
there is a quantitative relationship expressed as: ﬁsh catch
(kg)  5.46  ﬂoodplain area (ha). Care has to be taken,
however, as these studies are somehow conjecture since ﬁsh
catch does not equate to ﬁsh production. Fish catch is usually
adults, which may have achieved their production elsewhere,
and not juveniles. Fish concentrate in ﬂood plains and are
often easier to catch there (Galat & Zweimüller 2001).
Economic importance of ﬂood plains 
The estimated worldwide value of the services provided by
ﬂood plains is US$ 3920  109 yr1, assuming that total
ﬂoodplain area is about 2  106 km2 and area-based value is
US$ 19 580 ha yr1 compared to US$ 969 ha yr1 for forests
and US$ 92 ha yr1 for cropland (Constanza et al. 1997). In
total, ﬂood plains contribute  25% of all terrestrial
ecosystem services, although they cover only 1.4% of the land
surface area (for discussion on ﬂoodplain area see Aselman &
Crutzen 1989; Mitsch & Gosselink 2000). The major services
of ﬂood plains include disturbance regulation (37% of their
total value), water supply (39%) and waste treatment (9%).
Value of ﬂoodplain land in Illinois (USA) was quantiﬁed as
high as US$ 7500 ha yr1, with 86% based on regional ﬂood
water storage (Schaeffer et al. 2002). Nitrogen removal,
an
important
ﬂoodplain
service,
varies
from 0.5 to
2.6 kg N ha1 day1
(e.g. 2.6 kg NO3–N ha1 day1
in a
Danubian ﬂood plain; Tockner et al. 1999). Flood plains
along the Danube are valued at EUR 384 ha1yr1 for
recreation and nutrient removal (Andréasson-Gren & Groth
1995; 1 EUR  0.88 US$, March 2001). Similarly, the
nitrogen reduction capacity of Estonian coastal and ﬂood-
plain wetlands is worth EUR 510 ha1 yr1. Barbier and
Thompson (1998) valued the weighted aggregate of agricul-
tural, ﬁshing and fuelwood beneﬁts of a Sahelian ﬂood plain
at US$ 34–51 ha1 yr1. The natural value of the ﬂood plain
would be even higher if other important beneﬁts such as the
role in pastoral grazing and recharging groundwater were
included. Agricultural beneﬁts of a planned irrigation project
would, however, be only in the range of US$ 20–31 ha1 yr1.

Firewood, recession agriculture, fishing, and pastoralism 
generate US$32 per 1000m3 flood water, compared to US$ 
0.15 per 1000m3 water for irrigation. In the Inner Delta of 
the Niger River over 550 000 people with about 1 mill ion 
sheep and 1 million goats use the flood plain for post-flood 
dry season grazing (Dugan 1990). There are many other 
examples of how local communities make use of the diversity 
and productivity of flood plains and wetlands. Especially in 
drylands, the benefits of natural flood plains are very high 
and multifaceted. 
Extensive development in flood plains has increased flood 
damages at unprecedented rates over the past years (e.g. 
Burby 2002). For example, there is a 26% chance of a prop-
erty in the 100-year flood plain being damaged by flooding 
over the 30-year life of a standard mortgage (compared to 1% 
chance of fire damage; Burby 2002). In the USA, with 6 
million buildings located within the boundaries of a 100-year 
flood plain, flood losses are widespread and losses from flood 
hazards have increased dramatically over the last decades 
(averaging US$ 115 million per week) and will continue to do 
so in the next decades (Congressional Natural Hazard Caucus 
Work Group 2001).

ENVIRONMENT AL FORCING FACTORS 
Natural influences 
Flood plains are disturbance-dominated ecosystems charac-
terized by a high level of habitat heterogeneity and diverse 
biota adapted to the high spatio-temporal heterogeneity. The 
fo1mation and maintenance of flood plains is closely tied to 
fluvial dynamics (Hughes 1997; Ward et al. 1999a; cf. Fig. 1). 
Fluvial dynamics, including the expansion/ contraction of 
surface waters ('flood and flow pulses'), is also the driving 
force that sustains connectivity in flood plains (Junk et al. 
1989; Petts 1990; Tockner et al. 2000a; Ward et al. 2002; 
Table 3). Hydrologic connectivity, a key process in riverine 
flood plains, refers to water-mediated transfer of energy, 
matter and organisms within or among elements of riverine 
corridors. Inundation of flood plains is a complex phenom-
enon caused by different water sources via multiple 
pathways. Small changes in the relative contribution of indi-
vidual water sources may drastically alter species com position 
and species diversity. For example, local groundwater 
upwelling is often associated with a higher standing crop of 
algae, higher zoobenthos biomass, faster growth rates of

cottonwood trees and a higher species richness of woody and 
herbaceous plants (J.A. Stanford, personal communication 
2001). Despite its overwhelming importance in flood plains, 
hydrology is often given only cursory attention in restoration 
and mitigation projects (e.g. Bedford 1996). 
Human influences 
Flood plains are among the most altered landscapes world-
wide and they continue to disappear at an alarming rate, since 
floodplain 'reclamation' (i.e. elimination) is much higher than 
for most other landscape types (Vitousek et al. 1997; Olson & 
Dinerstein 1998; Ravenga et al. 2000). The net result is vast 
constriction of flood plains, sometimes by more than 50% of 
the historic expanse (Snyder et al. 2002). As a consequence, 
the decline of freshwater biodiversity, including the rich 
floodplain diversity, is much greater than in terrestrial 
systems. For example, 47% of all animals federally endan-
gered in the USA are freshwater species (Stein 2001). 
Although no specific data are available, we may expect a 
disproportional contribution by floodplain species (see Table 
2). T he major factors responsible for the decline of fresh-
water 
biodiversity 
are 
habitat 
alteration, 
pollution, 
competition for water, invasive species and overharvest 
(Abramovitz 1996). Among these factors, land transform-
ation is the single most important cause of species extinction 
(Vitousek et al. 1997). Habitat degradation and loss 
contribute to the endangerment of 85% of the imperiled 
species in the USA (Wilcove et al. 1998; Table 4). For fresh-
water groups, water development projects account for 91 % 
of threats to endangered fish and 63% to endangered 
amphibians. 
Habitat alteration 
Habitat alteration includes both the degradation of the 
natural landscape and the modification of the hydrologic 
regime. Worldwide, more than 500 000 km of waterways have 
been altered for navigation and more than 63 000 km of canals 
have been constructed (e.g. Abramovitz 1996). In the USA, 
only 2% (about 100 000 km) of rivers have sufficiently high 
quality features to be worthy of federal protection status 
(Benke 1990). T hese free-flowing sections are often single-
thread rivers that lack extensive flood plains. In Austrian

rivers with catchment areas > 500 km2, it is the floodplain 
segments that have been most severely impacted. Today, less 
than 2% of former braided, anastomosing and meandering 
Austrian rivers are in a semi-pristine state, compared to 25% 
of single-thread headwater streams (Muhar et al. 1998). 
To evaluate the effect of river regulation on selected 
Central European river-floodplain systems, we used shoreline 
length (the interface between the terrestrial and the aquatic 
compartments of the flood plain) as an index of habitat quality 
(Schiemer et al. 2001; K. Tockner, personal communication 
2001). In dynamic systems (e.g. the Tagliamento River, 
Italy), shoreline length can be up to 25 km per river km and 
remains high throughout the annual cycle, except during 
major flood events. In channelized rivers, however, shoreline 
length drops to about 2 km per river km (Fig. 2). Reduction in 
shoreline length not only affects habitat availability of already 
endangered communities but also impedes the exchange of 
matter and organisms between the river and its riparian area 
(Naiman & Decamps 1997). 
Hydrology is by far the single most important driving 
variable in flood plains (see Table 3). Changes in river flow 
alter the extent, duration and frequency of floodplain inun-
dation. After dam closure the Nile showed a reduced annual

Figure 2 Shoreline length (km per river-km) in natural 
(Tagliamento, north-east Italy), constrained (Danube, Alluvial 
National Park, Austria) and channelized (Rhone, Switzerland) 
river-floodplain systems. All flood plains are characterized by a 
dynamic hydrology (Van der Nat et al. 2002; K. Tockner, personal 
communication 2001). The Rhone and the Tagliamento River are 
comparable in discharge and catchment area. In its pristine state, 
the Rhone was morphologically similar to the present Tagliamento.

discharge, truncated annual floods, higher base flow rates and 
a several month shift in the timing of the flood peak. The 
maximum-to-minimum discharge ratio decreased from 12: 1 
to 2: 1, with far-reaching consequences for floodplain inunda-
tion (Fig. 3). The Senegal River, however, showed a gradual 
decrease in peak, average, and low water discharge, primarily 
as a result of increasing water abstraction for irrigation (Fig. 
3). During the dry season, the Senegal now frequently ceases 
to flow. The Danube River (downstream of Vienna, Austria) 
has a relatively unaltered hydrology with frequent 'flood' and 
'flow' pulses (Fig. 3). However, the flood plain is discon-
nected from the main channel by artificial levees, which 
drastically reduce the duration and frequency of floodplain 
inundation (Tockner et al. 2000a,b; see also Fig. 2). 
At present, about 3800 km3 of water is withdrawn annually 
worldwide, primarily for agriculture (Ravenga et al. 2000). 
Hydrological alterations by water withdrawal can be extreme 
in some systems; for example, less than 1 % of the natural 
flow of the Colorado River reaches the mouth. The Murray 
River in Australia now discharges only 36% of its natural 
flow into the sea, flood duration on the fringing flood plains 
has decreased from two months to a matter of days, and the 
timing of floods has shifted from spring to late summer (Jolly 
1996). 
At present, more than 40 000 large dams (> 15 m high) 
impound the world's rivers, inundating more than 
400 000 km2, increasing water storage capacity by 700%, 
reducing sediment transport, and changing the chemistry of 
river inputs, with long-term consequences for coastal ecosys-
tems (e.g. lttekot et al. 2000). Countless smaller dams modify 
river dynamics locally (e.g. more than 2.5 million dams< 8 m 
high are estimated for the USA alone; Richter et al. 1997). In 
the USA, at least 90% of the total discharge of rivers is 
strongly altered hydrologically, mainly by damming and 
water abstraction (Jackson et al. 200la). 
Riverine systems are strongly threatened by changing 
land-use patterns in the whole catchment and especially along 
the riparian margin of rivers and streams. Based on data from 
145 major catchments around the world (data from Ravenga 
et al. 1998), human impacts at both the catchment and the 
riparian level can be discerned (Fig. 4). Analysis of these data 
elucidates several patterns. Riparian areas are significantly 
more severely impacted than the total catchment (Wilcoxon 
matched pairs test, p < 0.0001, z = 6.28; Fig. 4a). The most 
impacted riparian corridors with respect to land use are found 
in Europe and in the densely populated areas in Asia (catch-
ments with population densities > 200 people per km2; Fig. 
4b). There, between about 60% and 99% of the entire 
riparian corridor has been transformed to cropland and/ or is 
urbanized, the latter in particular in Europe. The Seine River 
(France) shows the highest impact of all rivers investigated. 
There is a positive and linear relationship between human 
population density and land use of the riparian zone for Asian 
and African rivers (y = 0.28x + 10.41, r2 = 0.73, p < 0.0001; 
Fig. 4b). However, this relation is logarithmic rather than 
linear for European and American rivers (y = 15.4 ln(x) +

already highly 'developed' at a low level of population density 
(e.g. Mississippi, USA). The present analysis only considers 
areas with intensive agricultural development, mosaics of 
cropland and natural vegetation being excluded. Low land-
use values for African and many Asian river corridors, 
therefore, can be explained by more traditional and sustain-
able use of their riparian area. Based on the data, 11 % of the 
riparian area of African rivers (mean population density: 24 
people per km2) is intensively cultivated compared to 46% for 
North American rivers (excluding northern Canada and 
Alaska; mean population density: 24 people per km2) and 
79% for European rivers (mean population density: 75 
people per km2) .

Figure 4 Land-use patterns in major catchments of the world. (a) 
Correlation between land-use in the total catchment and within the 
riparian corridor. (b) Correlation between land-use and human 
population density (individuals per km2) in river catchments of 
different continents (data from Ravenga et al. l 998). Correlation 
between human population density and land use is indicated by 
broken lines for Africa/ Asia and Europe/ Americas. The areas of 
intensive agricultural land use and the urban areas were combined 
to calculate the relative proportion of intensively altered land for 
each of the 145 catchments and for riparian areas along the rivers. 
The riparian zone was defined as land within 5 km of major rivers 
within each catchment. The land-cover database was derived from 
1 km resolution satellite data (April 1992-March 1993; Ravenga et 
al. 1998, 2000). The distribution of urban areas was based on 
satellite images of night-time lights for 1994-1995 (5 km resolution 
stable-light database, National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration-National Geophysical Data Center 1998). 
Species invasion 
Species invasion is the second most important cause of the 
overall decline in aquatic biodiversity, leading to an acceler-
ated rate of redistribution of the freshwater fauna. In riverine 
systems, the combination of land transformation, altered 
hydrology, and numerous deliberate and accidental species 
introductions has perpetuated widespread invasions. Many 
river systems are already dominated by alien species. Non-
native species comprise 79% of the fish fauna of the Colorado 
River, 38% of the fish of the Columbia River or 21% of the 
fish of the Rhine River (Galat & Zweimueller 2001). The 
higher percentage of exotic plants and animals observed in 
flood plains compared to the uplands demonstrates the 
vulnerability of the riparian zone to invasion (Pysek & Prach 
1993). In fact, the same factors supporting high diversity in 
riparian habitats (transport of propagules, flooding distur-
bance, 
water 
availability) 
may 
also 
increase 
their 
susceptibility to invasion by exotic species (e.g. Pysek & 
Prach 1993). Along the Adour River, France, 198 riparian 
plant species disappeared between 1989 and 1999, and, by 
1999, there were 153 new species (Tabacchi & Planty-
Tabacchi 2000). Today, invaders account for one-quarter of 
the total species richness of 1558 species and can locally 
constitute up to 40% of all species. Despite great differences 
in climate, species richness and land-use history, the propor-
tion of invasive species along the Adour River is similar to 
rivers in the Pacific North-West of the USA and to South 
African Rivers (20-30%; Hood & Naiman 2000). In the 
southern USA, as a result of widespread human-induced 
changes in hydrology and land use, native cottonwood-
willow stands are being replaced by non-native woody species 
such as Russian olive (Eleagnus angustifolia) and tamarisk 
Tamarix sp. (saltcedar). Saltcedar now covers about 
500 OOOha of flood plain in the western USA, its superior 
drought tolerance relative to native phreatophytes and its 
ability to produce high density stands and high leaf area 
indices being major reasons why it is favoured by in-stream 
flow reductions (e.g. Cleverly et al. 1997). Based on a cost-
benefit calculation, the presence of saltcedar in the Western 
USA will cost an estimated US$ 7- 16 billion in lost 
ecosystem function within the next decades (c. US$ 
15 600-24 600 ha- 1; Zavaleta 2000). 
Po//ution 
Species composition and productivity of flood plains are 
influenced by the quality of the inflowing water. Artificially 
high nutrient inputs, for example, lead to an impoverishment 
of floodplain communities (e.g. lower Rhine; Van den Brink 
et al. 1996). Alternatively, the flood plain itself can serve as a 
major source of nutrients and pesticides when intensively 
cultivated; along many south-east Asian rivers huge amounts 
of pollutants are discharged into the main river during 
seasonal floods (e.g. Dudgeon 2000b). 
In developing countries an estimated 90% of wastewater is 
discharged directly into rivers and streams without treat-
ment, and in many parts of the world rivers are so polluted 
that their water is unfit even for industrial uses (Johnson et 
al. 2001). In China, 80% of the 50000 km of major rivers are 
too polluted to sustain fisheries and in 5% fish have been 
completely eliminated (F AO [Food and Agricultural 
Organization of the United Nations] 1999). Despite major 
treatment efforts, pollution is still a major problem in the

----- Page 8 (native) -----
Northern hemisphere (e.g. Van Dijk et al. 1994). For 
example, 75% of the water in the Vistula, Poland's largest 
river still containing many semi-natural flood plains, is 
unsuitable even for industrial use (Oleksyn & Reich 1994). 
High nutrient concentrations of the parent river are also a 
major obstacle to restoring flood plains along many rivers 
such as the Danube or the Rhine (Buijse et al. 2002). 
PREDICTED LONG-TERM TRENDS 
Because rivers and wetlands are among the most threatened 
ecosystems worldwide (Vitousek et al. 1997; Ravenga et al. 
2000), one of the major challenges is to meet increasing 
resource demands of a burgeoning human population while 
conserving aquatic ecosystems and the ecological services 
they provide for future decades. Many developing countries 
will experience a large increase in the relative water demand,

in particular due to rapidly expanding cities (Vorosmarty et 
al. 2000; Johnson et al. 2001). Flood plains are particularly 
sensitive to changes in river hydrology, to increased alter-
ations of the land-water interface, and to inputs of nutrients 
and toxicants (e.g. Naiman & Decamps 1997; Ward et al. 
I 999a; Nilsson & Berggren 2000; Ravenga et al. 2000). 
Changing water cycle 
Within the next decades, the sharp increase in human popu-
lation combined with economic expansion will lead to greater 
pressures on freshwater resources, mainly through infra-
structure development, water abstraction for agriculture and 
industry, conversion of land for resource development, and 
expansion in water withdrawal and consumption (e.g. Fig. 5). 
The effects of growing water consumption will be accentuated 
by land-use changes and by changes in the flow and flood

regime driven by climate change (IPCC [Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change] 2001). This growing imbalance
among freshwater supply, consumption and human popu-
lation will cause a great intensiﬁcation of the Earth’s
hydrological cycle (e.g. Jackson et al. 2001a). In the year 2025,
17–50% more water for irrigation will be needed. A rise of
only 17% will be achieved only if water use efﬁciency is as
high as 70%, food consumption per person does not increase,
and the relative contribution of irrigation to food production
remains constant (Fig. 5). Most of the increase in irrigation
will occur in the developing countries, particularly in south-
east Asia and Africa (Serageldin 1999). In Europe, future
quantitative pressures on natural water resources might tend
to stabilize in the central and northern countries, but will
increase greatly in the southern and eastern countries.
Increases of up to 100% by 2025 have been predicted for
many
Mediterranean
countries
making
the
remaining
wetlands and ﬂood plains particularly vulnerable (Margat &
Vallee 1999).
About 300 large dams ( 15 m) are currently built every
year, in particular in developing countries (Fig. 5). New
dams, despite major concern about expected environmental
and socio-economic impacts will threaten most of the present
large free-ﬂowing rivers. In the Brazilian Amazon alone, a
total of 79 major hydrologic dams (100–13 000 MW) are
planned. As many as 278 dams could be constructed in the La
Plata basin in Argentina and 32 dams are either planned or
have been built in the Magdalena basin, Colombia (Pringle
2001). Along the mainstem Mekong River, 12 sites for dams
have been identiﬁed that will completely alter the ecosystem
(Dudgeon 2000c). The Three-Gorges dam along the Yangtze
River will probably not be able to prevent future damage by
ﬂoods, a major rationale for its construction. The hydraulic
retention capacity of the impounded reservoir only compen-
sates for the natural retention capacity of ﬂoodplain lakes lost
during the last decades (e.g. the Dongtin ﬂoodplain lake alone
lost about 40% of its immense volume between 1954 and
1983; Zong & Chen 2000).
Projected changes during the 21st century caused by
climate change include more intensive precipitation events
over many areas (very likely), increased summer drying over
most mid-latitude continental interiors and associated risks
of drought (likely) and higher minimum temperatures (very
likely; IPCC 2001). Changes in climate could increase the risk
of abrupt and non-linear changes in many ecosystems, which
would affect their function, biodiversity and productivity. A
warming of 3–4C is predicted to eliminate 85% of all
remaining wetlands (UNEP-WCMC [United Nations
Environment Programme-World Conservation Monitoring
Centre] 2001). The ﬂow regime of the River Rhine, for
example, will change from a combined rain-fed/snow-fed to
a predominantly rain-fed regime, associated with an increase
in interannual variation and larger ﬂoods (Middelkoop &
Kwadijk 2001). Projected effects for ﬂood plains include low
water during the growing season and higher water tempera-
tures. The return period of extreme precipitation events will
decrease almost everywhere. In 2070, for example, ﬂoods that
presently have 20-year return periods are projected to occur
twice as often (Zwiers & Kharin 1998). For North Carolina,
USA, an increase in precipitation of 15% (5–30%) is
predicted by 2100, which will shift ﬂoodplain boundaries and
make recent human developments in ﬂoodplain areas
especially vulnerable to ﬂood damage. Similar effects are
predicted for the Paciﬁc North-West. 
Changing ﬂoodplain area 
Accurate global assessments of wetland extent are elusive due
to their complexity and highly dynamic nature (Finlayson &
Davidson 1999), but, based on recent estimates, wetlands
cover nearly 10% of the Earth land surface; of these 2% are
lakes, 30% are bogs, 26% are fens, 20% are swamps and 15%
are ﬂood plains (Ramsar & IUCN 1999). Estimates of ﬂood-
plain area vary as a function of the criteria used to delineate
them. The area of a ﬂood plain can be delineated by hydro-
logic (area inundated by a 100-year ﬂood), geomorphic (area
covered by recent alluvial deposits) or ecological criteria (area
colonized by organisms adapted to ﬂooding). 
In the following, we provide an overview of global ﬂood-
plain distribution patterns and discuss their present and
future state. This is a difﬁcult task since many estimates of
ﬂoodplain size are based on old references, and there are
major inconsistencies between different sources (see Table 6
later). An added difﬁculty is that adequate information on the
extent and status of ﬂood plains is not available for large
geographic regions, such as the central and eastern parts of
the former USSR. Flooding along the Lena River in the year
2000, as a result of extensive ice-jams, has shown that vast
areas of lowland Siberia are composed of fringing ﬂood
plains. At a global scale, total ﬂoodplain area estimates vary
from 0.8  106 km2 (Aselmann & Crutzen 1989) to 1.65 
106 km2 (ﬂood plains and swamps; Constanza et al. 1997) to
2.2  106 km2 (ﬂood plains along rivers and lakes; Ramsar &
IUCN 1999).
Flood plains vary markedly in size. The largest gap and
uncertainty in ﬂoodplain characterization is the size and
duration of ﬂoodplain inundation. Sahagian and Melack
(1998) suggested that ﬂoodplain extent should be expressed
in terms of hectare-days (or equivalent units), thereby
allowing both spatial and temporal analysis of key ecological
and biogeochemical functions. In Table 5, we list expansion
and contraction patterns of selected ﬂood plains. The large
geographic differences in the timing and the extent of
ﬂooding are further complicated by human impacts such as
water abstraction and regulation. Along the lower
Mississippi, for example, the ratio of high water (HW):low
water (LW) area decreased from about 17 before regulation to
 5 at present (Table 5). Decline in inundation area is often
associated with a shift in inundation timing (e.g. Nile River;
Fig. 3). Most ﬂood plains experience large seasonal and
interannual ﬂuctuations. Flood plains in the Mediterranean
as well as in other dry areas are particularly sensitive to

Table 6 Distribution and extent of selected fringing riverine ﬂood plains (including a few rain-fed ﬂood plains). Area of ﬂood plain is
during the season of maximum inundation. a The reported areas differ substantially between reference sources: Upper Nile Swamps (Sudd):
 30 000 km2 (Mitsch & Gosselink 2000), 50 000 km2 (Groombridge 1992) and  90 000 km2 (Howard-Williams & Thompson 1985).
Central Niger Delta: 30 000 km2 (Howard-Williams & Thompson 1985) and 320 000 km2 (Mitsch & Gosselink 2000). Middle Congo
depression: 70 000 km2 (Howard-Williams & Thompson 1985) and 200 000 km2 (Mitsch & Gosselink 2000). Several major ‘ﬂood plains’
listed are composed of different wetland types including swamps, wet grasslands or shallow lakes (e.g. Kagera valley, Central Congo basin,
Sudd, Orinoco delta). b Data compiled by Howard-Williams and Thompson (1985) and Thompson (1996). Flood plains in Mozambique or
Angola are not included since not enough information was available at the date of compilation (Howard-Williams & Thompson 1985;
Thompson 1996). c Dadnadji and Van Wetten (1993) report that wetlands along the Lagone and Chari cover 78 000 km2 including
inundated ﬂats, riverine ﬂoodplains, marshes and smaller lakes. d Plantations cover 50% of the remaining ﬂood plains.

hydrologic alterations, and they will experience a major
future reduction in the HW:LW ratio.
In Africa, by far the most extensive wetlands are season-
ally-ﬂooded savannah and forested ﬂood plains, which
comprise nearly half of the total wetland area of that conti-
nent. Howard-Williams and Thompson (1985) listed 44 large
African ﬂood plains or wetlands that have major ﬂoodplain
elements. Nineteen of these ﬂoodplain complexes cover a
total area of 307 000 km2 (Thompson 1996). This is probably
a great underestimation since large areas like the Central
Congo basin (at least 100 000 km2) or ﬂood plains along the
rivers in Mozambique and Angola as well as the countless
smaller ﬂood plains are not included. Many of the large
African ﬂood plains are still relatively untouched, however
they are disappearing or are being transformed at an acceler-
ating rate as a result of water management activities, in
particular by large-scale irrigation schemes and the ongoing
construction of dams (Fig. 3). For example, the inundated
area of the Hadejia-Nguru ﬂood plain in northern Nigeria
decreased within the last decade from 2350 km2 to between
700 and 1000 km2 as a result of altered hydrology (Barbier &
Thompson 1998). The ﬂoodplain forests of the Tana River
(Kenya) are drying up mainly because of the truncation of
ﬂoods by the construction of upstream dams (e.g. Hughes
1988). In many Sahelian ﬂood plains, water depth is very
shallow during inundation, making them extremely sensitive
to even minor hydrological changes (e.g. Senegal River; Fig;
3). For example, the ﬂood plain of the Sudd (Sudan) is
covered on average by water of about 1 m depth, although the
area inundated can be up to 90 000 km2. Along the Nile, the
construction of the Aswan High Dam completely changed
the seasonal ﬂood dynamics. Effects persist for more than
1000 km downstream, with further impacts on the ﬁsheries of
the Eastern Mediterranean, erosion of the deltic area and salt
intrusion upstream (Abu Zeid 1989).
North America has lost about 50% of its original wetland
cover. The largest decline of any wetland category was for
forested freshwater wetlands, primarily riverine ﬂood plains.
Originally, ﬂood plains covered 7%, or about 700 000 km2, of
all land in the USA (Kusler & Larson 1993). Nowadays, pris-
tine ﬂood plains are primarily limited to Alaska, where about
50% of the extant ﬂood plains occur. Along the Missouri
River in the state of Missouri, between 1879 and 1972
channel length was shortened by 73 km, aquatic surface area
decreased by 50%, 97% of islands and 63% of the riparian
forest disappeared, cultivated land increased by 65% and
commercial ﬁshery yield dropped by 85% (Galat et al. 1998).
Along the Mississippi 90% of the ﬂood plain (former area:
123 000 km2; Sparks et al. 1998) is leveed. During the 1993
ﬂood, however, about 70% of the 2530 km long artiﬁcial
levees were damaged (Myers & White 1993). Remaining
ﬂoodplain forests on the Mississippi alluvial plain down-
stream of the Ohio River conﬂuence cover 18 700 km2,
corresponding to a loss of about 80% of the original cover
(Llewellyn et al. 1996). During the great ﬂood in 1927,
however, ﬂood waters of the Mississippi inundated about
52 000 km2 downstream of Cairo, Illinois, USA. Along the
Upper Mississippi, 10 380 km2 of ﬂood plain are still
unleveed and retain seasonal ﬂood pulses, one of the few such
situations in the developed world. 
About 20% of the South American tropical lowlands are
regularly ﬂooded ( Junk 1997, 2002). In the upper Amazon
basin, 26% of the present-day lowland forests have the
characteristics of recent erosional and depositional dynamics,
and 12% are in successional stages along the active river
channels (Salo et al. 1986). Along the Peruvian lowland
Amazon (including local tributaries) about 100 000 km2 are
classiﬁed as ﬂood plains (Krist & Nebel 2001). 
In Siberia, the Lena River forms the largest northern delta
and contains up to 150 separate river branches. In China,
more than 600 000 km2 are covered by wetlands, although
about 60% are artiﬁcial (mainly paddy ﬁelds; Lu 1995). In
1953 and 1998, the Yangtze River (China) ﬂooded areas of
475 500 km2 and 212 000 km2, respectively, killing thousands
of people and causing immense economic damage (Zong &
Chen 2000). In Bangladesh, the landscape itself has an
average age of less than 10 000 years, and the entire nation has
essentially been created on a giant ﬂood plain, the world’s
largest delta (Khalil 1990). More than 20% of the country is
regularly ﬂooded (23 000 km2), with up to 70% inundation
during an extreme ﬂood event (e.g. in 1988). However, most
of this giant ﬂood plain has been transformed into productive
agricultural land supporting one of the world’s most densely
populated regions. The use of climate change models
predicts substantial increases in mean peak discharges within
the next decades (Mirza 2002). Asian ﬂood plains are likely to
experience the greatest change within the near future
(Dudgeon 2002). The main threats will be: deforestation and
drainage-basin alterations that destroy in-stream and riparian
habitats; river regulation including ﬂow modiﬁcation;
pollution; and overharvesting (mainly ﬁsh and reptiles). The
damming of the Tigris and Euphrates led to a dramatic
drying of large parts of the Mesopotanian ﬂood plains, one of
the world’s most signiﬁcant wetland complexes and a biodi-
versity centre of international importance, with several
endemic species now at risk of extinction. During the last
decades more than 9000 km2 of Mesopotanian wetlands
disappeared (UNEP 2001).
In Australia, the combined area of ﬂood plains along the
Murray River is about 1000 km2, with most of the individual
ﬂood plains being  10 ha in size (Mackey & Eastburn 1990).
Along Cooper Creek and the Paoo River in Central Australia,
one of the world’s largest endorheic drainage systems (catch-
ment: 1.14  106 km2), up to 106 000 km2 become ﬂooded
(Kingsford et al. 1998). During major ﬂoods, water spreads
over a maximum width of 60 km. In arid Australia climate
change will result in a drying or reduced frequency of large
ﬂood events with catastrophic effects for many biota, particu-
larly water birds, which use a mosaic of wetland habitats at
broad spatial scales (Roshier et al. 2002).
European ﬂood plains are presently in a critical situation
(e.g. Wenger et al. 1990; Klimo & Hager 2001). European

wetlands (excluding the European part of Russia) cover 
404 000 km2, about 4.4% of the land surface (WWF [World 
Wide Fund for Nature] & EU [European Union] 2001). This 
is a rough estimate since an adequate database is available for 
only six out of 44 countries. Overall, about 50% of the orig-
inal wetlands are lost; however, the rate is much higher for 
riverine flood plains with a loss of up to 95% (Table 6). In 
Hungary, for example, as recently as the end of the 19th 
century, the lowland river Tisza, the largest Danube tribu-
tary, transformed half of the Great Hungarian Plain into a 
giant flooded lake almost every year at the time of the melting 
snows (Fig. 6). Lateral damming has reduced the flood plain 
by > 90%. However, during recent years, severe floods again 
inundated the entire former flood plain causing major 
damage. Switzerland has lost about 95% of its original flood 
plains during the last two centuries. The remaining areas, 
which are included in the inventory of 'flood plains of 
national importance', are heavily influenced by water abstrac-
tion, 
gravel 
mmmg, 
and 
fragmentation 
(BUW AL 
[Bundesamt fiir Umwelt, Wald und Landschaft] 1993). 
Eighty per cent of the flood plains of national importance are 
decoupled from the hydromorphological dynamics of the 
river. Today, the largest remaining floodplain fragment in 
Switzerland covers an area of only 3 km2• 
Many of the remaining European flood plains are far from 
pristine and have lost most of their natural functions. For 
example, of the former 26 000 km2 floodplain area along the 
Danube and its major tributaries, about 20 000 km2 were 
separated by levees and have therefore become 'functionally' 
extinct, which means that the basic attributes that sustain the 
flood plain such as regular flooding or morphological 
dynamics are missing (Busnita 1967; Nachtnebel 2000). The 
fringing flood plains along the Austrian Danube between 
Vienna and Bratislava have been designated as an inter-
nationally 
recognized 
national 
park, 
despite 
major 
morphological and hydrological modifications and heavy 
nutrient loads of the parent river (Tockner et al. 2000b). 
Although greatly impacted, these floodplain segments 
deserve protection since they are the most valuable areas 
remaining along the entire corridor. These flood plains show 
still a high degree of reversibility making them suitable focal 
points for restoration (e.g. Schiemer et al. 1999). 
Because > 90% of European flood plains are already 
'cultivated', even impacted systems that retain some 
semblance of natural functions, such as flood plains along the 
Oder River (Poland/Germany), the Danube River, or along 
eastern European river corridors, are worthy of protection. 
Wetlands and flood plains are inhabited by a variety of 
'endemic' human societies that are well adapted to wetland 
conditions and that have developed a rich local culture. Many 
of these people are already listed as threatened by the Society 
of Threatened Peoples (http:/ /www.gfbv.de), and there is 
a great risk that the ongoing environmental impact on 
large river-floodplain complexes will also increase the future 
risk of their extinction. Examples include the Lozi people in 
the Borotse flood plain, the Tonga people in the Kafue 
Figure 6 Former flood 
plains (grey areas) in 
Hungary and the

1981).

flood plain, or the Ogani in the Niger delta; the latter are 
threatened by oil exploitation in addition to changing 
hydrology. The Nuer, Dinka and Shiluk in the Sudd area 
(Nile) are threatened by civil war and by the construction of 
the Jonglai Canal (see Society for Threatened People, 
http:/ /www.gtbv.de). The Mesopotamian 'Marsh Arabs' 
(population size: 350 000- 500 000), the ethnic link between 
present inhabitants of Iraq and the people ancient to 
Mesopotania, such as the Sumerans and Babylonians, are 
largely affected by the drying of wetlands, seeking refuge in 
nearby areas and urban centres (UNEP 2001). 
Changing floodplain structure 
A major way that fluvial processes influence biodiversity is the 
turnover of floodplain alluvium. One measure of turnover is 
the minimum age of the oldest parts of the floodplain sedi-
ment. Hughes (1997) reported sediment ages ranging from 
100-600 years for most minimally impacted alluvial rivers, and 
2000 years for the Amazon. This means that different spatio-
temporal scales have to be considered in order to evaluate the 
effect of anthropogenic and natural impacts on riverine flood 
plains (see Fig. 1). For example, the duration offloods has been 
the most important variable driving riparian dynamics of the 
Yampa River, Colorado, USA (Poiani et al. 2000). With no 
flooding the predicted abundance of mature cottonwood 
would decrease from 40% at present to about 20% within a 
period of about 120 years, and would disappear completely in 
about450 years (Fig. 7a). A similar story has been documented 
for the Old Man River in Alberta, Canada (Rood & Heinze-
Milne 1989) and the Missouri River, Montana and South 
Dakota, USA (Johnson 1992). Flow stabilization below dams 
reduces floodplain size and flooded extent (Ward & Stanford 
1995; Molles et al. 1998; Snyder et al. 2002). The effects of this 
reduction include disruption of the riparian ecosystem, alter-
ations of trophic structure, and reduced diversity of organisms 
highly adapted to periodic inundation and the associated input 
of nutrients and sediments. Along Alpine rivers (e.g. the lsar 
and the Lech; Fig. 7b), areas with secondary successional 
stages of vegetation expanded dramatically after dam construc-
tion, leading to > 90% decrease of pioneer communities 
within a period of less than 70 years. A post-dam equilibrium 
dominated by later successional species could be reached in 
about 150 years following dam closure. This projection 
excludes other potential land-use practices such as clear-
cutting. However, flow regulation can permit widespread 
development of novel wetlands such as the productive and 
diverse marshes as along the Colorado River downstream of 
Glen Canyon Dam (Stevens et al. 1995). 
In Europe, dense floodplain forests (e.g. Petts et al. 1989) 
fringe formerly braided rivers (e.g. the Upper Danube). 
These extensive forests are largely an ecological legacy of past 
flooding. These stands, although considered as extremely 
worthy for protection, are senescent, and in the absence of 
flood disturbance will not be replaced.

Declining biodiversity 
In the near future, flood plains will remain among the most 
threatened systems, and they will disappear faster than any 
other wetland type. In particular, Asian, African and South 
American flood plains will disappear at accelerating rates. 
The twelve most species-rich countries (based on total 
number of species and number of fish species per l 000 km2) 
are all in the developing areas (except the USA which ranks 
sixth in total number of species), with gross primary produc-
tions of mostly <US$ l000 yr-1 (based on the 1997 index). 
These countries will experience a rapid population growth 
combined with economic development that will increase the

pressure on their natural resources, in particular on fresh 
waters. The greatest decline in biodiversity is expected to 
occur in Asian fresh waters, where more than any other part 
of the world the most globally threatened ecosystems occur 
(Dudgeon 2002) and many more species are already listed as 
endangered (Table 7). 
The projected mean future decline in aquatic biodiversity 
is about five times greater than the rate for terrestrial fauna 
and three times the rate for coastal marine areas. The rate of 
freshwater biodiversity decline is equivalent to the rate for 
tropical forest communities (Abramovitz 1996). For North 
America, for example, a future extinction rate of 4% per 
decade is predicted (Ricciardi & Rasmussen 1999). In North 
America 40 freshwater fish species disappeared between 1880 
and 1990, with a sharp increase in the past 30 years (Fig. 8a). 
Although fish are among the best-investigated freshwater 
groups, many fish species will go extinct before they are 
discovered. During the past IO years 200 new fish species 
have been described annually. The causes of extinction of 
freshwater fishes are habitat degradation (78%), introduction 
of exotics (68%), pollution and hybridization (38% each) and 
overharvest (15%). 
The global population database comprises 4500 time 
series over 1800 animal species. This is an important resource 
of information in tracing long-term trends; however, it 
contains almost no wetland or floodplain species (NERC 
[National Environment Research Council] 1999). The 
Freshwater Ecosystems Index, based on the population 
trends of 102 freshwater vertebrate species for which time-
series population data could be obtained, demonstrates an 
alarming density decline of freshwater vertebrate populations 
in the developed word (WWF 1999). On average, freshwater 
populations declined by about 45% between 1970 and 1995, 
compared to 35% for marine systems (Fig. 8b; WWF 1999). 
Although not specifically indicating the trend for wetlands or 
flood plains, this index includes many characteristic flood-
plain species (e.g. many mammals or amphibians). We may 
expect an even sharper decrease for wetland species, since a 
higher proportion of their species is endangered (cf. Table 2). 
Overexploitation of natural flood plains not only leads to 
biotic impoverishment, it also limits opportunities for devel-
oping a fuller understanding of the processes operating in

these dynamic systems. For example, the limited knowledge 
of the dynamic hydrologic-morphologic interactions in 
natural wetlands/flood plains is the primary reason that so 
many restoration projects fail. About 80% of restoration 
projects examined by Lockwood and Pimm (1999) did not 
meet their major goals.

Increasing invasion
Novel disturbances such as clear-cutting or intensiﬁcation of
natural disturbances such as siltation play a signiﬁcant role in
biotic invasion. The progression from immigrant to invader
often involves a lag phase, followed by a phase of exponential
increase that continues until reaching the bounds of its new
range (see Fig. 8c). This makes it difﬁcult to predict future
invaders. For example, Impatiens glandulifera, native to the
Himalayas, has invaded large areas of European and North
American ﬂood plains. Like many other invaders, it reduces
the ﬁtness of competitors, in this case simply by attracting
many more pollinators (e.g. Chittka & Schürkens 2001). In
the Czech Republic, Impatiens glandulifera and Reynoutria
japonica (alien species from the Far East) exhibited exponen-
tial invasion rates after a lag phase of several decades. The
time at which the exponential increase commenced was
around 1940 for both species. Nowadays, they occupy more
than 400 (I. glandulifera) and about 150 (R. japonica) riparian
localities in the Czech Republic (Fig. 8c). Ongoing rapid
anthropogenic alterations of riverine ﬂood plains will increase
the proliferation of such invading species.
POTENTIAL STATUS IN 2025
Although perhaps more severe, the major ecological conse-
quences that we may expect by 2025 for ﬂood plains are
similar to those predicted for most aquatic systems (Naiman
& Turner 2000; Malmqvist & Rundle 2002). The projected
changes will be manifest as what has been termed the ‘distress
syndrome’ (sensu Rapport & Whitford 1999), indicated by
reduced biodiversity, altered primary and secondary
productivity, reduced nutrient cycling, increased prevalence
of diseases, increased dominance of invaders and a predomi-
nance of shorter-lived opportunistic species. Since many
ﬂood plains respond very slowly to anthropogenic impacts,
the ultimate effect of a given impact may be even more severe
that expected from short-term projections. Hydrological
change and channelization have generated shifts in the
physical habitat that will take sufﬁciently long to be reﬂected
by the long-lived biotic elements of the ﬂood plains (e.g.
Hughes 1997). This means that the lag time differs between
abiotic changes and biotic adjustments. Therefore, a high
biodiversity still observed in many regulated ﬂood plains has
to be considered as a relict of former conditions, since unidi-
rectional development of the ﬂood plain can be slow but will
ﬁnally lead to a substantial decrease in diversity and major
shift in community composition.
Today, over 60% of the world population live within 1 km
of surface water, primarily along rivers and along the coast-
line. Increasing urbanization in the developing countries will
further increase the land-use pressure on riparian systems.
By the year 2025, 60% of the projected eight billion humans
are expected to live in large cities. The low intensity of
present land use along rivers in Africa and Asia, compared to
Europe and the Americas, is primarily due to the low rate of
urbanization. Present urban growth rates in major African
catchments range from 3.6% yr1 in the Limpopo to 8.8%
yr1 in the Lake Tanganyika catchment (Ravenga et al. 1998).
In the Mekong catchment, the population is projected to
double within the next 25 years and the basin’s economy to
increase by 400% (Shiklomanov 1998). Increasing population
growth and food production will further alter the global
nitrogen cycle. By 2020 the global production of nitrogen
fertilizer could increase to 134 Gt yr1 from a level of 80
Gt yr1 in 1994 (Galloway et al. 1994; see Fig. 5). 
The 21st century has been proposed as the century of
nature restoration. By 2025 an area equivalent to the size of
the entire Great Lakes basin in North America, and water
courses equivalent to the combined lengths of the Rhone and
Rhine rivers, are expected to be restored to full health
throughout the world (IUCN 2000). Such predictions may,
however, be overly optimistic. For example, although 15 000
km of streams and rivers in Switzerland have been identiﬁed
for restoration programmes, the annual rate of river-ﬂood-
plain restoration is only 11 km compared to 70 km lost during
the same period by regulation (BUWAL 1993). Even if
further degradation were to cease, it would take more than
1000 years to restore Switzerland’s rivers and streams. Even
this is an optimistic prediction, since it ignores the limited
ecological success of most restoration projects.
Optimistic predictions (e.g. IUCN 2000) contrast sharply
with the projected increases in population, water abstraction
and economic development. The impending global-scale
changes in human population and economic development
over the 2025 time horizon will dictate the future relation
between water supply and demand to a much greater degree
than any other factor (e.g. Vörosmarty et al. 2000). The
uncertainties in the changes in hydrology predicted for many
regions translate to even greater uncertainties in how
regional-scale biodiversity and biogeochemical cycles may
change ( Jackson et al. 2001a). In 2025, 48% of the world’s
projected population is projected to live in water-stressed
basins ( Johnson et al. 2001). Since growing water scarcity is
intimately linked to the alarming decline in aquatic biodiver-
sity, a major decline in aquatic biodiversity may be realized
by 2025, particularly in the developing world. Together with
waters in xeric regions and cataracts, riverine ﬂood plains are
the most threatened freshwater ecosystems (Olson &
Dinerstein 1998; Hughes & Rood 2001). A change in the
ecological status of ﬂood plains is closely linked to hydrologic
change. Even small decreases in ﬂood volumes can result in
large reductions in area ﬂooded, particularly in semi-arid and
arid areas. In the Murray-Darling basin (Australia), 87% of
divertible water resources are already diverted, leaving
almost no water for ﬂood plains (Kingsford 2000). 
In 2025, the most water-stressed countries will be located
in Africa and in Asia. In 1989 a continent-wide water crisis
was predicted for Africa for the year 2025, when 22 countries
with two-thirds of the continent’s population would be water
stressed (Falkenmark 1989). Careful cost/beneﬁt calculation
of the services provided by natural ﬂood plains are required

to develop the rationale needed for their future preservation.
In South America, many ﬂood plains will become reduced in
size, including extensive ﬂood plains along the large
(sub)tropical rivers. Pollution from expanding mega-cities,
hydropower generation, construction of large navigation
canals (e.g. crossing the Pantanal), and ongoing deforestation
are the primary threats to South American ﬂood plains ( Junk
2002).
By 2025, an optimistic prediction for developed countries
is to achieve a balance between river kilometres restored
annually and those regulated annually. The lack of reference
data from pristine systems, however, constrains the capability
to restore ﬂood plains and mitigate damage to them. In North
America, the commendable policy of ‘no net loss’ of wetlands
will nonetheless not prevent further degradation of semi-
natural ﬂood plains. Reconstructed wetlands and ﬂood plains
that are subject to large restoration programmes (e.g.
Kissimmee, Mississippi) can only provide a pale reﬂection of
their dynamic natural state. Moreover, we should be aware
that it is easy to underestimate the degradation of ﬂood plains
because of their naturally high ecological resistance and
resilience and the extended lag phase before the severity of
human impacts becomes readily apparent. Ecological diver-
sity and redundancy within trophic levels, coupled with the
longevity of the most obvious species (trees, ﬁsh), are the
most important reasons for delay between impact and
ecological response; eventually, however, a sudden collapse
of the entire ecosystem is to be expected. For comparison, in
marine systems time lags of decades to centuries occurred
between the onset of overﬁshing and consequent changes in
ecological communities ( Jackson et al. 2001b). 
Most remaining and protected ﬂoodplain fragments in
Europe and North America are in danger of becoming ‘sinks’
for their wildlife. In Switzerland, for example, more than
40% of the riparian-obligate species are listed as endangered
(Table 2). These obligates are living in a highly fragmented
landscape, and many populations can be expected to become
extinct within the next decades, even if those ﬂood plains are
preserved. 
The concept of ‘minimum dynamic area’ has already
become an important consideration in the design of conser-
vation areas (Poiani et al. 2000). Large-scale disturbances
such as major ﬂood events create a diverse, shifting mosaic of
successional stages and habitats of different types and sizes
(Ward et al. 2002). The minimum dynamic area must provide
room for the geomorphic processes that reshape the ﬂood
plain and create and rejuvenate the complete array of patch
types. Riparian ecosystems are dependent upon disturbance
caused by occasional high ﬂows. Resource managers
concerned with maintaining ﬂoodplain systems need to
consider ways to preserve ﬂows that are crucial to the survival
of native riparian species. One of the main lessons from the
past 100 years of river-ﬂoodplain control is that to sustain the
integrity of large alluvial rivers, restoration must ﬁnd a place
for change by ‘changing ﬂows (certainly) and moving chan-
nels (ideally)’ (Petts 1996).
CONCLUSIONS
This analysis of the present and future state of riverine ﬂood
plains conveys a dismal prognosis indeed, despite recognition
of the important services provided by these ecosystems.
Perhaps the only hope for sustaining functional ﬂood plains
over the long term lies with highly enlightened management
and restoration efforts. 
As a ﬁrst step a global database on the location and size of
wetlands in general and ﬂood plains and their complex
wetlands in particular is urgently needed. Major biophysical
features, including information on the expansion/contraction
of ﬂoodplain areas and the timing of ﬂoods (see Table 5) must
be included in this assessment. In a second step, a compi-
lation of threats, land tenure, management and studies on the
beneﬁts and values of different wetland types are required. A
third step is to initiate greater conservation of ﬂood plains
through creation of ﬂoodplain natural areas and riparian
greenbelts along the entire corridors of rivers from headwa-
ters to mouth. Conservation easements and purchases to
silence development rights (e.g. for gravel mining and ex-
urban development) to protect remaining intact ﬂood plains
are urgently needed. Natural uses of ﬂood plains far outweigh
the value of human activities that constrain ﬂoodplain struc-
ture and function. Finally, a more robust and predictive
understanding of how changes in hydrological connectivity
and habitat fragmentation affect ﬂoodplain communities is
required to foster better and more proactive conservation
practices. Flood plains need to be understood by the general
public for the values they provide in the form of natural
goods (harvestable ﬁsheries) and services (natural cleansing
of water). 
Of course, many questions remain about ﬂoodplain
ecology that need to be investigated within the next decades.
They include: the synergistic effects of ‘stressors’, the identi-
ﬁcation of ecological thresholds, the minimum dynamic areas
required for basic ecological functions, such as nutrient
retention and transformation, long-term trends in ﬂoodplain
populations, the role of ﬂood plains in controlling processes
at the catchment and corridor scale, and the interactions
between aquatic and terrestrial communities. However, we
must act now to protect these valuable ecosystems, based on
the incomplete yet considerable information available.
Restoration projects, carefully planned and monitored, may
serve as large-scale ﬁeld experiments for a better under-
standing of the dynamics and complexity of riverine ﬂood
plains.
Non-governmental organizations and multinational insti-
tutions such as IUCN, UNEP, UNESCO, Worldwatch
Institute, World Resource Institute, WWF, Ramsar Bureau,
Nature Conservancy or Birdlife International, among many
others, play a leading role in transferring basic research infor-
mation to the public and to decision makers and in securing

scientiﬁc knowledge about the strategic importance of ﬂood
plains to healthy rivers that parallels the accelerating deterio-
ration of remaining systems. 
The clear and unavoidable conclusion is that governments
must ﬁnd the will and way to preserve existing intact ﬂood
plain rivers as strategic global resources, and begin to restore
hydrologic dynamics, sediment transport and riparian
vegetation to those rivers that retain some level of ecological
integrity. Flood plains must be viewed as conservatories of
regional biodiversity and as fundamental units of river
ecosystems that facilitate clean water and provide renewable
timber, ﬁsheries and wildlife resources, among many other
natural goods and services. Most importantly, ﬂood plains are
natural ﬂood control structures and they should be used that
way. Indeed, recent horribly-damaging ﬂoods on the
Mississippi River (USA) and elsewhere clearly were exacer-
bated by the very revetments that were designed to allow
human encroachment onto the ﬂood plains. A new era of
naturalization of ﬂood plains is needed to protect the integrity
of river corridors. Flood plains designated for conservation or
restoration must be large enough to support key species and
perform key functions. Conducting protection and resto-
ration on small reaches, without considering longitudinal
linkages of ﬂood plains throughout their catchment basin,
will simply not work. Rather, an expansive catchment view of
river landscapes is required, a leitbild or set of normative
conditions that restores enough ﬂow and sediment to produce
variability of landscape form within river corridors. Possible
constraints on river ﬂow must be removed so that ﬂood plains
can function in a normative way, allowing the river to do the
conservation and restoration of ﬂoodplain habitats, as
opposed to using heavy equipment to artiﬁcially engineer
solutions (sensu Stanford et al. 1996). The goal is to maximize
human beneﬁts by capitalizing on the natural functional attri-
butes of river landscapes for ﬂood and drought control and
maintenance of biota. Otherwise, a dramatic extinction of
aquatic and riparian species and of ecosystem services is to be
expected by 2025 and in the decades following.
