Abstract
Gold colloids have fascinated scientists for over a century and are now heavily utilized in
chemistry, biology, engineering, and medicine. Today these materials can be synthesized
reproducibly, modified with seemingly limitless chemical functional groups, and, in certain cases,
characterized with atomic-level precision. This Review highlights recent advances in the
synthesis, bioconjugation, and cellular uses of gold nanoconjugates. There are now many
examples of highly sensitive and selective assays based upon gold nanoconjugates. In recent years,
focus has turned to therapeutic possibilities for such materials. Structures which behave as gene-
regulating agents, drug carriers, imaging agents, and photoresponsive therapeutics have been
developed and studied in the context of cells and many debilitating diseases. These structures are
not simply chosen as alternatives to molecule-based systems, but rather for their new physical and
chemical properties, which confer substantive advantages in cellular and medical applications.

1. Introduction
Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have a rich history in chemistry, dating back to ancient Roman
times where they were used to stain glasses for decorative purposes. The modern era of
AuNP synthesis began over 150 years ago with the work of Michael Faraday, who was
possibly the first to observe that colloidal gold solutions have properties that differ from
bulk gold.[1,2] Reliable and high-yielding methods for the synthesis of AuNPs, including
those with spherical and nonspherical shapes, have been developed over the last half-
century.[3] The resulting AuNPs have unique properties, such as size- and shape-dependent
optical and electronic features, a high surface area to volume ratio, and surfaces that can be
readily modified with ligands containing functional groups such as thiols, phosphines, and
amines, which exhibit affinity for gold surfaces.[3] By using these functional groups to
anchor the ligands, additional moieties such as oligonucleotides, proteins, and antibodies can
be used to impart even greater functionality. The realization of such gold nanoconjugates
has enabled a broad range of investigations, including programmed assembly and
crystallization of materials,[4,5] arrangement of nanoparticles into dimers and trimers onto

DNA templates,[6] bioelectronics,[7–9] and detection methods.[10,11] The application of gold
nanoconjugates for biodetection and biodiagnostics have been reviewed elsewhere.[12–14]
In recent years, gold nanoconjugates and their properties have led to new and exciting
developments with enormous potential in biology and medicine. These investigations
represent a new direction that greatly deviates from the more established use of gold
nanoconjugates as labels for electron microscopy.[15] Our recent studies, as well as those of
several other research groups, have shown that gold nanoconjugates, when functionalized
with appropriate surface moieties, can readily enter living cells. These developments have
forged a new frontier in nanoparticle research, including the broader use of gold
nanoconjugates in cellular biology and the promise for their eventual use as therapeutic
agents.
In this Review we describe the current status of gold nanoconjugates for cellular and
therapeutic uses. As surface chemistry is one of the key features that controls the properties
and functionality, we have divided this Review into sections based on the type of surface
functionalization, including citrate, amine, nucleic acid, peptide, antibody, and lipid ligands
(Table 1). In each section, our discussion focuses on chemical synthesis, physical and
chemical properties, as well as investigations and applications in cells. In Section 8, we also
propose key opportunities and open questions that have yet to be addressed by the scientific
community. These questions should inspire future investigations and lead to discoveries that
continue the development of the rich chemistry of gold nanoparticles.
2. Citrate and Transferrin
Citrate-functionalized gold nanoparticles can be prepared on a relatively large scale and with
a high degree of monodispersity by using the methods of Frens[16] as well as Enustun and
Turkevich.[17] These methods allow for the synthesis of citrate-capped spherical
nanoparticles with diameters ranging from 5 to 250 nm.[16,17] This well-established
synthesis and the ability to finely control size has contributed to citrate-functionalized
nanoconjugates forming the basis of recent investigations of the uptake of gold nanoparticles
by cells.[18] In one such study, Chan and co-workers determined how the size and shape of
the particles influence their ability to be internalized by cells.[19] Their study demonstrates
that, in a HeLa cell model, the amount of time that the citrate particles remain internalized is
independent of the particle size when they have diameters between 14 and 74 nm. However,
the size does affect the total number of nanoparticle conjugates internalized during the
experiment. By using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES)
to determine the intracellular gold content, these researchers determined that citrate-capped
gold nanoconjugates with diameters of 50 nm are most readily internalized by HeLa cells
(Figure 1). They found that the maximum number of citrate-stabilized gold nanoconjugates
taken up by a HeLa cell is 3000, 6160, and 2988 for gold nanoconjugates with diameters of
14, 50, and 74 nm, respectively.
The mechanism by which the citrate-capped gold nanoconjugates enter cells has been the
subject of investigation. Chan and co-workers recorded transmission electron microscopy
images of internalized “bare” citrate nanoconjugates and showed that the particles were
mainly localized within vesicles inside of the cells.[19] They correlated cell uptake with the
nonspecific adsorption of proteins to the citrate-capped nanoparticle surfaces.
The negatively charged citrate surface provides a convenient scaffold to attach positively
charged proteins such as transferrin, which is expected to facilitate and improve entry into
cells. In one study, atomic force microscopy was used to image transferrin-coated citrate-
functionalized gold nanoconjugates on the cell surface.[20] The images obtained suggest
vesicle formation at the cell surface and nanoconjugate internalization through endocytosis.

A series of experiments by Chithrani and Chan further determined that transferrin-coated
citrate-functionalized gold nanoconjugates enter cells through the clathrin-mediated
endocytosis pathway.[21]
Many investigations in cells use citrate-capped AuNPs as important precursors of covalent
conjugates with additional functionality, because further derivatization has been shown to
increase uptake ability,[22] alter intracellular localization,[23,24] or impart functionality that
can be used to affect a cellular response.[25,26] Indeed, citrate-coated particles are generally
not ideal structures for investigations and internalization studies on cells. They are
susceptible to environmentally induced aggregation and can be quite difficult to work with.
In the next sections we describe the major classes of gold nanoconjugates that are
functionalized with designer ligands, which have been developed and used for experiments
on cells.
3. Amines
In addition to the methods of Enustun and Turkevich and of Frens, alternative methods for
the synthesis of gold nanoparticles have been developed. The Brust–Schiffrin method allows
for the synthesis of monodisperse gold nanoparticles ranging from 1 to 3 nm in diameter.[27]
The resultant nanoparticles are stabilized by a monolayer of alkanethiolates. The
composition of the monolayer can be changed through a substitution reaction to include
specific functionalities, depending on the intended use of the nanoparticles.[28] Accordingly,
gold nanoconjugates functionalized with a monolayer of amine-terminated alkanethiolates
(hereafter referred to as amine-functionalized) have been prepared for various biological
applications.
3.1. Gene Transfection
The ability to induce control over biological systems at the genetic level is a fundamental
concept in experimental biology, and holds great promise for developing new treatments of
disease.[29] The search for the best method for controlling gene expression is ongoing. Their
straightforward synthesis and high-degree of chemical tunability has resulted in amine-
functionalized nanoparticles having been developed as a means to transfer genetic material
into cell models.[26,30]
Amine surface groups are positively charged at physiological pH values, and thus amine-
functionalized nanoconjugates electrostatically interact with negatively charged nucleic
acids. Studies by Rotello and co-workers have demonstrated that 2 nm gold nanoparticles
functionalized with a mixed monolayer containing quaternary amines and uncharged surface
groups are able to bind DNA plasmids and deliver them efficiently to 293T cells.[26] In fact,
these nanoconjugates are able to transfect these cells with a greater efficiency than the
commonly used cationic polymer transfection agent polyethylenimine (PEI, 60 kDa). These
researchers also found that the efficiency of the nanoparticle-mediated gene transfection was
affected by the ratio of positively charged quaternary amines to negatively charged
phosphate groups on the DNA, as well as the relative amount and length of the surface-
bound uncharged thiol chain. Building on these observations, these researchers have recently
shown that gold nanoparticles functionalized with lysine moieties are highly efficacious at
delivering DNA plasmids, and outperform a commercial vector by a factor of 28.[31]
The utility of amine-functionalized nanoconjugates for gene delivery was also demonstrated
by Thomas and Klibanov.[30] In this study, combinations of thiol-modified PEI (2 kDa) and
dodecyl-PEI (2 kDa) were used as surfactants or complexing agents during AuNP synthesis.
The concentration of PEI was used to control the size of the functionalized nanoparticles

from 2.3 to 4.1 nm in diameter. The resultant nanoconjugates deliver plasmid DNA to
COS-7 cells more efficiently than PEI alone.
3.2. Drug Delivery
Site-specific delivery, stability, and the programmed release of the drugs to physiological
targets have been major challenges for molecular and macromolecular therapeutics.[32] The
highly tunable and multivalent surface architecture of gold nanoconjugates offers the
potential to incorporate multiple therapeutic agents as well as to target and protect molecules
on the surface of a single nanoparticle, and thus are expected to improve the delivery and
efficacy of therapeutic payloads. New generations of novel nanoconjugates with AuNPs as
their cores have been designed and synthesized.[33] A recent study by Feldheim and co-
workers has shown how multivalent AuNPs functionalized with derivatives of an important
HIV antagonist are highly effective at silencing viral production in a cell model.[34]
Rotello and co-workers have developed a cationic 2 nm gold nanoconjugate functionalized
with thiol-modified alkyl amines that possess photoactive o-nitrobenzyl ester linkages,
which can be cleaved with near-UV irradiation (Figure 2).[35] Irradiation releases the
positively charged alkyl amine from the particle, thereby resulting in a net negatively
charged carboxylate-functionalized nanoparticle. The reversal in charge provides an
effective means of releasing a negatively charged payload such as an oligonucleotide from
the nanoparticle surface. These cationic nanoparticles with photocleavable ligands were
shown to inhibit transcription of the bound oligonucleotide; however, the transcription
activity can be recovered following the cleavage reaction. Intracellular delivery of the bound
oligonucleotide was also demonstrated in MEF cells. Fluorescence-based experiments show
that, upon photoinduced cleavage, the bound DNA is released from the nanoparticle surface
to the intracellular environment where it then localizes in the nucleus. A similar strategy has
been developed to deliver anticancer drugs.[36]
Another study by Rotello and co-workers demonstrates an alternative method of releasing
molecules from gold nanoparticle drug carriers. In this method, gold nanoparticles
functionalized with a mixed monolayer of amine-terminated and fluorophore-labeled alkyl
thiol ligands were internalized by either HepG2 or MEF cells. Exposure to intracellular
environments containing an elevated glutathione concentration (a thiol-possessing peptide)
results in substitution and the passive release of the nanoconjugate ligands.[37]
3.3. Stability
In addition to providing functional groups, surface-bound ligands also contribute to the
stability of the AuNPs. The stability of the nanoconjugates is an important consideration for
their potential use as therapeutic agents because they must maintain their stability under
harsh conditions such as in the cell or in the bloodstream. In a study by Rotello and co-
workers, the effect of surface charge on the stability of amine-functionalized gold
nanoparticle was characterized.[38] In this study, 2 nm gold nanoparticles functionalized
with combinations of positively charged amines, negatively charged carboxylates, and
fluorescent ligands were used. Various thiol species were tested for their ability to displace
ligands bound to the nanoparticle surface. It was found that increasing the net positive
charge on the nanoparticle surface caused a more rapid displacement of ligands, whereas
more negatively charged nanoconjugates did not display measurable displacement of
surface-bound ligands.[38] This result is consistent with studies by our research group on the
stability of 13 nm oligonucleotide/gold nanoparticle conjugates which found that the
negatively charged thiolated oligonucleotide ligands are not easily displaced in intracellular
environments or by small molecules such as glutathione.[25]

4. Oligonucleotides
Over the past decade, our research group and others have synthesized, characterized, and
applied polyvalent DNA-functionalized gold nanoconjugates (DNA-AuNPs).[4] This unique
class of nanomaterial consists of a gold nanoparticle core that is functionalized with a dense
shell of synthetic oligonucleotides. DNA-AuNPs exhibit cooperative properties that result
from their polyvalent surfaces,[39–43] and these properties have been applied to areas such as
programmable crystallization[44–46] and enzyme-free biodiagnostic assays.[47,48] Indeed, the
optical, catalytic, and binding properties of DNA-AuNPs have been used for a variety of
colorimetric,[11,49,50] electronic,[7] scanometric,[51] and Raman-based[52] detection
strategies, some of which have recently been commercialized and approved by the American
Food and Drug Administration.[51]
4.1. Synthesis
Nanoconjugates densely functionalized with synthetic oligonucleotides are prepared by
mixing alkanethiol-terminated oligonucleotides and citrate-capped AuNPs. Oligonucleotide
ligands displace the citrate from the AuNPs through formation of a gold–thiol bond. NaCl is
added to the reaction mixture to shield charge repulsion, thus allowing a greater number of
oligonucleotides to chemically adsorb to the nanoparticle surface, thereby resulting in a
dense monolayer of oligonucleotides (Figure 3). Approximately 250 oligonucleotides can be
chemisorbed to the surface of 15 nm diameter AuNPs, thus creating polyvalent
structures.[53] Methods have been optimized for functionalizing particles with diameters
ranging from 2 to 250 nm.[54,55] This polyvalent material has a number of emergent
properties that are unique from the properties of the oligonucleotides or the AuNPs alone.
4.2. Properties
One unusual but now fairly well understood property of DNA-AuNPs is their ability to bind
complementary nucleic acids with a high affinity.[56] In fact, polyvalent particles exhibit
binding constants as large as two orders of magnitude greater than the analogous molecular
oligonucleotides of the same sequence.[40] Experimental data and later theoretical models
show that this property likely arises from the dense packing and high local concentration of
oligonucleotides on the gold surface.[41,57] Additionally, the oligonucleotides on the AuNP
surface are close enough such that the counterions associated with one oligonucleotide also
act to screen negative charges on adjacent oligonucleotides. This additional charge screening
causes increased stabilization of the oligonucleotide duplex, thereby increasing the effective
binding constants associated with the DNA-AuNP compared with molecular
oligonucleotides. Consistent with this observation, larger particles that have more DNA per
particle, but less DNA per unit area exhibit affinities comparable to the molecular system
and lower than the gold nanoconjugate structures.[58] In the context of cellular applications,
it was hypothesized and subsequently demonstrated that the higher binding constant of the
DNA-AuNP would lead to better intracellular binding of the target molecule, thereby
increasing the effectiveness of antisense gene regulation (see Section 4.4.1).[25]
Nucleic acids are often hampered in biological investigations by enzymatic hydrolysis,
which leads to degradation and renders them inactive.[59,60] Another emergent property of
DNA-AuNPs is resistance to degradation by enzymes such as DNase I.[25] Two explanations
have been proposed as the origin of this enhanced stability: First, the dense packing of DNA
on the surface of the particle could result in steric inhibition of enzyme binding, so that the
inaccessible, particle-bound DNA would not be engaged or cleaved by the enzyme. An
alternate hypothesis is that the high local ion concentration associated with the densely
packed DNA inhibits enzyme activity, since it is known that high concentrations of Na+ ions
result in a reduction of enzymatic activity.[61,62] Experiments elucidating these two

possibilities have recently been carried out.[63] Molecular DNA and DNA-AuNPs have
similar enzymatic degradation rates under conditions where salt concentrations do not affect
the enzymatic activity. However, the DNA-AuNP reaction rate is greatly slowed relative to
that of molecular DNA under conditions where the salt concentrations affect enzymatic
activity. The study concluded that the local Na+ concentration is the dominant factor that
contributes to the enhanced stability of DNA. The resistance of DNA-AuNPs to enzymatic
degradation is an important property that renders these structures extremely promising
candidates for introducing nucleic acids into cells, where oligonucleotide degradation has
historically been a major challenge.
4.3. Cellular Uptake
Perhaps the most surprising property of DNA-AuNPs is their ability to enter a wide variety
of cell types. The facile uptake of these structures into cells was not predicted, given that
these structures contain a densely functionalized shell of polyanionic DNA (ca. 100 DNAs
on the surface of each 13 nm gold particle), and that strategies for the introduction of
oligonucleotides typically require that DNAs are complexed with positively charged agents
to effect cellular internalization. Indeed, because of their high negative charge, most
researchers at the time would have predicted that the nanoparticles would not enter cells.[64]
Remarkably, it has been shown in all the cell types examined to date (which include over 30
cell lines, primary cells, and neurons, Table 2) that DNA-AuNPs can be added directly to
cell culture media and are subsequently taken up by cells in high numbers (Figure 4).
Quantification of uptake using ICP-MS shows that while the number of internalized
particles varies as a function of cell type, concentration, and incubation time, the cellular
internalization of DNA-AuNPs is a general property of these materials. Importantly, the
density of DNA on the particle surface was found to be the deciding factor of DNA-AuNP
uptake. At DNA surface loadings of greater than about 18 pmolcm−2, cellular uptake can
exceed one million DNA-AuNPs per cell.[65] The importance of the polyvalent arrangement
of oligonucleotides to cellular uptake can be further emphasized when comparing DNA-
AuNPs to other types of AuNPs. For example, HeLa cells internalize only a few thousand
citrate-coated gold particles,[19] compared to over one million DNA-AuNPs under nearly
identical conditions.[65] Importantly, fluorescence spectroscopy studies reveal that the
thiolated oligonucleotides remain bound to the AuNPs after cellular internalization (Figure
4).
Given the surprising ability of DNA-AuNPs to enter cells, the mechanism of uptake is of
great interest. Interestingly, biophysical characterization of DNA-AuNPs after exposure to
serum-containing media reveals changes in the charge and size of the nanoconjugates.
Exposure to cell culture conditions results in greater positive charge and larger nanoparticle
diameter (as measured by zeta potential and light scattering), which was further shown to be
caused by the adsorption of proteins.[65] The interaction of polyvalent nanoparticle
conjugates with proteins provides a possible mechanism of recognition and subsequent
internalization of these highly negatively charged particles, the details of which are still
under intensive investigation.
4.4. Applications in Cells
Methods based on nucleic acids for detecting and controlling gene expression have had a
significant impact on fundamental studies of gene pathways and functions.[29] Methods for
controlling gene expression include the use of antisense oligonucleotides[66] and small
interfering RNA (siRNA),[67] which can be directed against messenger RNA (mRNA)
through Watson–Crick pairing. While the promise of “gene therapy” based on nucleic acids
was recognized over 20 years ago, its development has faced challenges with regard to entry
into cells, delivery of intact oligonucleotides, and efficacy.[68] Various transfection agents,

such as cationic lipids and polymers,[69] modified viruses,[70] dendrimers,[71] liposomes,[72]
and nanoparticles,[26,73] have thus been developed to shuttle nucleic acids into cells. Despite
the use of these materials, the toxicity of these agents and their offtarget effects limit the
amount of oligonucleotides that can be delivered safely. An ideal gene regulation system—
from a research standpoint—should feature high uptake efficiencies across all cell types,
high intracellular stability, strong binding affinity for target nucleic acids, and very low
toxicity. Recently DNA-AuNPs were used as agents to alleviate several of the challenges
that are commonly associated with the application of nucleic acids in cells.[25]
4.4.1. Antisense Gene Control—We hypothesized that, because of their enhanced
binding properties, DNA-AuNPs could act as potent “sponges” for binding mRNA and
preventing translation into proteins. As a demonstration of this concept, we developed
DNA-AuNPs that target the mRNA sequences that code for enhanced green fluorescent
protein (eGFP) expressed in mouse endothelial cells. An antisense sequence complementary
to an internal coding region of the mRNA for eGFP was used in the design and synthesis of
“antisense nanoparticles”.[25] Quantitative measurement of expression by using fluorescence
assays demonstrates that these particles outperform lipid-complexed DNA used in a direct
comparison. Initial experiments demonstrate a silencing of approximately 20%, but further
optimization of the experimental parameters and conjugate structure has increased the gene
silencing ability to greater than 75% (Figure 5).
Although more than a decade of studies have been dedicated to the synthesis and
characterization of DNA-AuNPs, functionalization is not limited to DNA-type oligomers.
Indeed, AuNPs can be encoded with a suite of designer oligonucleotides that confer
enhanced properties, ranging from increased target specificity to catalytically enhanced
biological processing.[74,75] In a recent example, locked nucleic acid (LNA) nanoparticle
conjugates have been synthesized and investigated.[76,77] LNAs incorporate bridged sugars
in their backbones, which have been shown to increase binding affinity and increase duplex
stability.[78] AuNPs densely functionalized with LNA form remarkably stable duplexes with
complementary nucleic acids, and can be easily handled and manipulated under biologically
relevant conditions. For application in cells, the use of LNA-modified AuNPs increases the
effectiveness of gene knockdown compared to analogous DNA-modified AuNPs.[77]
4.4.2. Intracellular Detection and Imaging—Oligonucleotide-based probes to
visualize and detect intracellular RNA, including those used for in situ staining,[79,80]
molecular beacons,[81,82] and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) probes[83,84]
are important biological tools to measure and quantify biological activity in living systems.
However, cells do not readily internalize molecular probes, they require the use of
transfection agents or microinjection for uptake. In addition, as a consequence of their
oligonucleotide structure, such imaging agents can have limited stability to nuclease
degradation, which can lead to a high background signal and decreased ability to specifically
detect target structures.
Much work has thus gone into the development of structures that overcome these
limitations, including chemically modified molecular beacons[85] or their corresponding
peptide conjugates.[86] Recently, our research group has developed novel intracellular
detection probes termed “nanoflares” that take advantage of the properties of DNA-
AuNPs.[87–89] Nanoflares are oligonucleotide-functionalized gold nanoparticles that are
hybridized to short, fluorophore-labeled complements designed to provide an intracellular
fluorescence signal that correlates with the concentration of a specific nucleic acid or
molecular target. In the absence of a target, the fluorophore is close to the nanoparticle
surface, which quenches its fluorescence. Target binding releases the fluorophore, thereby
generating a signal that can be detected inside a live cell. Nanoflares can distinguish

between different cell types on the basis of the expression profile, and give a
semiquantitative real-time readout of gene expression in a living sample (Figure 6).
Several problems commonly associated with intracellular RNA detection, including the
difficulty associated with cell entry, toxicity, and intracellular instability, are obviated as
these nanoparticles are densely functionalized with oligonucleotides. These probes do not
require microinjection or auxiliary reagents to enter cells and are more resistant than
molecular nucleic acids towards enzymatic degradation, thus lowering background signal
and improving detection ability.
4.4.3. RNA Interference—Additional work is now underway on conjugates
functionalized with RNA-capping ligands that are capable of acting in the highly potent
RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. Recently, we determined that RNA-AuNPs can be
synthesized and subsequently introduced into cells without the use of transfection agents.[90]
Traditional RNAi uses molecular RNAs, which have extremely short half-lives as a result of
the instability of ribonucleotides to RNase-type enzymes, thus limiting their efficacy.[91,92]
In the case of RNA-gold nanoconjugates, a dense monolayer of surface-immobilized RNA
increases the protection from nonspecific degradation both in cell culture media and in the
intracellular environment. These structures are over six times more stable than molecular
RNA in serum-containing media, and this enhanced stability does not rely on chemical
modifications to the RNA molecular structure. We have further shown that the RNA-gold
nanoconjugates have a more persistent ability to silence genes. The enhanced stability and
high cellular uptake should result in these structures playing an important role in future
fundamental studies as well as in the therapeutic application of RNAi.
4.4.4. Cellular Detection—In addition to intracellular applications, Tan and co-workers
have developed a colorimetric assay that uses DNA-AuNPs for the detection of cancer cells.
Specifically, AuNPs were functionalized with a monolayer of aptamers selected to have a
high affinity for surface receptors expressed by a cancer cell line (CCRF-CEM).[93] The
aptamer-functionalized nanoconjugates assemble on the cell surfaces, which causes their
surface plasmon resonances to interact. This results in a red shift in the extinction spectra,
thus providing a direct readout of target binding. The strong extinction of AuNPs means that
the presence of cancer cells can be detected by the naked eye or by using a spectrometer,
which eliminates the need for expensive and complicated instrumentation and makes the
assay potentially useful for cancer diagnosis or disease screening.
5. Peptides
The targeting portions of many proteins are short stretches of oligopeptides. Peptide-based
nuclear localization signals have been used to alter the intracellular localization and increase
efficacy of conjugated biomolecules.[94] Such peptide signaling sequences are often
composed of a stretch of positively charged amino acids such as arginine and lysine, which
interact with Importin A for transport across the nuclear envelope.[95] Sequences derived
from the HIV Tat protein (CYGRKKRRQRRR) and integrin binding domain
(CKKKKKKGGRGDMFG) have been studied extensively for delivery of exogenous
proteins and synthetic materials to the nucleus.[23,96–99]
5.1. Peptide Nanoconjugates
Recently, examples of peptide–gold nanoparticle conjugates have been reported. Feldheim,
Franzen, and co-workers conjugated peptides to gold nanoparticles through attachment to
bovine serum albumin (BSA) and subsequent electrostatic association.[23,100] The resulting
nanoconjugates enter the nucleus of HepG2 cells in culture. Interestingly, only
nanoconjugates functionalized with peptides containing both a receptor-mediated

endocytosis (RME) and nuclear localization signal (NLS) are able to enter the nucleus of
these cells (Figure 7). The same researchers recently investigated the ability of AuNPs
modified with both peptides and polyethylene glycol (PEG) to enter cells. Interestingly, the
particles are actively internalized even if the PEG molecule within the monolayer is large
(molecular weight: 5000).[101] These studies point to exciting opportunities in the design of
multifunctional conjugates.
5.2. Peptide/DNA-Gold Nanoparticle Conjugates
We recently prepared gold nanoconjugates functionalized with both antisense
oligonucleotides and NLS or HIV Tat peptides.[102] Our synthetic strategy uses thiolated
oligonucleotides and cysteine-terminated peptides to functionalize the AuNP surfaces. As
the oligopeptides and oligonucleotides are oppositely charged, the addition of salt is required
to screen oppositely charged biomolecules during synthesis. When tested in cell culture, the
resultant conjugates are internalized and localized in the perinuclear region. Consequently,
these particles have a high gene silencing ability (>75% decrease in expression of the target
protein).
5.3. Multifunctional and Multicomponent DNA Nanoconjugates
The versatility of nanoconjugates can be increased by incorporating multiple functional
groups into each construct, or by rationally designing it to have multiple functions. Recently,
our research group has demonstrated that nanoflares (see Section 4.4.2) can be adapted for
both intracellular mRNA detection and gene knockdown.[88] These nanoflares enter cells
and bind mRNA in a location suitable for gene knockdown, thereby decreasing the relative
abundance of mRNA, while simultaneously releasing a fluorescent flare. Here, the nanoflare
provides a read-out of gene regulation inside the cell. Such capabilities will provide valuable
feedback, as the results of manipulating a cellular system can be observed in real time. In
addition, one can, in principle, create all sorts of cell-sorting genetic screening asays by
using the nanoflare approach.
Other therapeutic nanoconstructs have been designed to take advantage of the uptake of
DNA-AuNPs by cells. For example, PtIV complexes are being explored for chemotherapy in
an effort to reduce the side effects of cisplatin. Studies by the research groups of Lippard
and Mirkin have shown that AuNPs can be modified with both oligonucleotides and
cisplatin prodrugs. These constructs, similar to their cannonical DNA counterparts, deliver
the drug payload effectively to cells.[127] The prodrug consists of a PtIV complex designed
to be reduced and released as active cisplatin in the acidic endo-somes of cells. In addition,
synthetic handles (in this case, a carboxylic acid) can be added to the cisplatin precursor to
allow for straightforward conjugation to the oligonucleotides through amide linkages. Future
work in this area will examine regulating gene expression to chemosensitize the cells while
delivering drugs. Such multicomponent conjugates should decrease the amount of
chemotherapeutic agent needed for therapeutic efficacy while simultaneously reducing
systemic toxicity.
6. Antibodies
Antibody-labeled gold nanoconjugates have been used in immunohistochemistry for almost
40 years.[15] Recently, however, there has been a resurgence in their use as a consequence of
the development of gold nanoconjugates for live cell studies. Synthetic methods to produce
antibody-gold nanoconjugates include adsorption,[15] N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester
chemistry,[103] and oligonucleotide-directed immobilization.[104] Antibodies can adsorb to
AuNPs through hydrophobic and ionic interactions, or through chemisorption of native thiol
groups present in their chemical structure.[105] However, conjugates synthesized with this

method have limited stability because the proteins are easily desorbed.[106] AuNPs
functionalized with monolayers containing NHS esters can be reacted with the primary
amine groups of the antibody to form more stable structures. Alternatively, DNA-AuNPs
can be hybridized with antibodies that have been conjugated to complementary
oligonucleotides.[106]
6.1. Imaging
AuNPs modified with antibodies specific to cancer-associated proteins have been used to
image cancerous cells. In one example, conjugates with antibodies to epithelial growth
factor receptor (EGFR) were incubated with oral epithelial cancerous and noncancerous
epithelial cells. Light microscopy experiments show that conjugates bind to cancerous cells
with a six times greater affinity than the noncancerous controls, thus making this technique
potentially useful for the detection of cancer cells.[107]
6.2. Photothermal Therapy
Gold nanorods[108] and nanoshells[109] conjugated with antibodies are being developed as
photothermal therapy agents that use antibody-coated surfaces to hone in on cancerous cells.
For example, nanoshells conjugated to antibodies against human epidermal growth factor
receptor 2 (HER2) were incubated with cancerous cells over-expressing HER2 receptors.
These cells were then irradiated with near-IR light at a frequency that is resonant with the
surface plasmon resonance of the nanoshell. Light absorption leads to heating, which causes
cell death.[110] Nanoshells conjugated to control antibodies did not display this affect,
because of the lack of nanoshell binding on the cell surfaces. These conjugates are also
being developed as materials that combine photothermal therapy with near-IR imaging
capabilities.[107,110]
7. Lipids
Recently, lipids have joined oligonucleotides, peptides, and antibodies as biomolecules used
to modify AuNPs. Our research group and others have synthesized biomimetic high density
lipoprotein (HDL) nanostructures by adsorbing lipids and proteins to the surface of
AuNPs.[111] In this synthesis, thiolated lipids or alkanethiols along with apolipoprotein A1
(APOA1), a protein component of HDL, are adsorbed onto the surface of AuNPs. Next, a
second lipid is adsorbed onto the AuNP surface through hydrophobic interactions between
the lipid tails and thiolated species. Simple methods for synthesizing HDL with control over
the size, shape, and composition had not been demonstrated prior to these studies. It is being
increasingly appreciated that size, shape, and chemistry of HDL has an impact on its in vivo
physiology, and these structures may prove useful as therapeutics and imaging
agents.[111,112]
7.1. Therapeutics
Natural HDL is critical for transporting cholesterol from macrophages in atherosclerotic
plaques and from the body, and increasing the HDL levels may provide an approach to
preventing or reversing atherosclerosis. To that end, our research group synthesized HDL
mimics called HDL AuNPs whose size as well as protein and lipid contents are similar to
those of natural HDL (Figure 8). Importantly, these nanostructures can be used to determine
the strength of interactions between HDL and cholesterol. In our first example using these
conjugates we showed that HDL AuNPs are capable of binding a fluorescent cholesterol
analogue with a high binding affinity (Kd = 4 nm).[111] To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first measured binding constant for any form of HDL and a cholesterol derivative. This
is important as it provides a key data point from which to evaluate future constructs and
their ability to bind cholesterol as well as their potential as new therapeutic candidates.

7.2. Imaging
In addition to cholesterol transport, HDL-AuNP mimics have been used to image
macrophage cells in vivo.[112] Macrophage density is indicative of high-risk atherosclerotic
plaque, thus making it an attractive imaging target. Mice fed high cholesterol diets, an
established model for atherosclerosis, were injected with HDL-AuNPs. Tomography images
of the mice aortas showed a build-up of HDL-AuNPs, thereby indicating that the
nanoparticles could be applied to atherosclerotic imaging.
8. Summary and Outlook
Gold nanoconjugates are an important class of materials that have already proven useful in
fundamental cell biology applications. As is the case with all nanomaterials, little is known
about the interactions of gold nanoconjugates and cells at the molecular level, and the design
criteria for research and therapeutic usage are still being formulated. In the next sections, we
discuss emerging challenges in the field. In our opinion, these questions will be the key
towards the further development of gold nanoconjugates into viable therapeutic agents.
8.1. Mechanism of Uptake in Cells
Several research groups have now confirmed the internalization of gold nanoconjugates in
common cell-line models. The mechanism of cellular internalization is likely to differ for
different classes of gold nanoconjugates because of differences in their surface chemistry,
size, and charge. Indeed, substitution reactions can be used to modulate the ability of an
AuNP to be internalized by a cell.[24,113] In the case of AuNPs functionalized with
positively charged amines or peptides, the mechanism likely involves the interaction of these
positive moieties with the negatively charged cell surface.[26] In the case of antibody
conjugates or those that possess peptidic internalization signals, interactions between
specific cell-surface antigens are likely mechanistic steps.[23] Negatively charged gold
nanoconjugates likely follow yet another uptake pathway. Studies by our research group and
others suggest that internalization in the cell may involve the interaction of proteins with the
nanoparticle surfaces.[21,65] Identifying the proteins that allow the negatively charged gold
nanoconjugates to penetrate cells stands as a formidable challenge.
8.2. Targeting
The use of gold nanoconjugates provides a highly effective method for introducing
substances into cells. We have described how the unique ensemble properties of these
materials allow for multivalent drug and antisense agents. These agents can be used to
control cellular function, regulate gene expression, and detect intracellular analytes with
greater efficiency than molecular systems, which is in part due to composite properties and
proven cellular uptake ability across diverse cell types. An important challenge for the
continued development of these materials as therapeutics is to target specific cells and
eventually tissues and organs. Strategies for targeted delivery may include the use of
biomolecules such as antibodies,[108] aptamers,[114] peptides,[23] or small molecule
ligands.[115]
Targeting strategies need to be integrated with functionality to create multifunctional
particles for delivering oligonucleotides or other therapeutic cargos to target cells. For
example, antibodies targeted against surface receptors for appropriate cellular targets should
be able to effect cell-specific uptake and limit nonspecific uptake, but they must also
maintain the other desired activity and properties of nanoconjugates. In the case of
polyvalent DNA-AuNPs, moieties such as antibodies must be attached in a manner that does
not limit the degree of DNA functionalization or the properties that result from the density
of DNA. While this is not trivial, it is noteworthy that cofunctionalized AuNPs have already

been synthesized and preliminarily studied, including structures which successfully
incorporate peptides without compromising complementary binding to nucleic acids.[102]
These results are promising steps towards the next generation of targeted polyvalent
nanoconjugate therapeutics.
8.3. Toxicity
The toxicity of several types and sizes of gold nanoconjugates has been investigated by a
number of independent research groups. Although results have varied to date, several
important conclusions can be drawn from these studies. Perhaps the most salient is that the
toxicity of gold nanoconjugates is dependent on the chemical composition of the surface
ligands. In fact, it is often the surface group itself that leads to toxicity. For example,
although gold nanoconjugates functionalized with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide
(CTAB) were initially thought to be toxic, it was subsequently determined that the particles
do not cause cytotoxicity if they are washed to remove excess ligand.[18] Additional work in
this area, has shown how the toxicity of a ligand such as CTAB is reduced when complexed
with an AuNP,[116] presumably because of an alteration of the cellular localization of the
toxic agent. Rotello and co-workers have also shown how the chemical functionality and
charge of nanoconjugate surface ligands influence toxicity. These researchers found that
while amine-functionalized particles were only mildly toxic, particles functionalized with
carboxylic acids were nontoxic under all the conditions examined.[117]
Several recent studies have focused on the toxicity of citrate-capped nanoconjugates. One
study investigating human dermal fibroblasts determined that the rate of cell proliferation,
spreading, and adhesion is slowed by the presence of citrate-capped nanoconjugates.[118]
The authors presented evidence that actin stress is the cause of these effects. A second,
independent study also reports decreased cell growth in the presence of citrate-capped
nanoconjugates, and in this case, the authors present evidence that this is the result of
oxidative damage.[119] Similar results have also been reported when similar particles were
used in myeloma cells.[120] Although acute and gross toxicity was not observed in these
cases, the adverse effects of citrate-capped nanoconjugates merit further attention.
Intriguing recent investigations demonstrate that the size of the conjugate also determines its
toxicity. In a recent study, Simon, Jahnen-Dechent, and co-workers examined a panel of
phosphine-functionalized AuNPs with diameters ranging from 0.8 to 15 nm. These
researchers found that 1.4 nm diameter particles were toxic, whereas 15 nm diameter
particles were nontoxic, even at up to 100-fold higher concentrations.[121] In the case of
these 1.4 nm diameter particles, evidence is presented that toxicity results from necrosis;
however, neither 1.2 nor 1.8 nm diameter particles display this effect. Chan and co-workers
have recently investigated the cell response to herceptin-coated gold nanoparticles within the
2–100 nm size range and found that 40 and 50 nm particles have the greatest effect on cell
signaling functions.[122] Clearly, these are important findings that need to be explored
further. The challenge will be preparing a range of particle sizes by using a common
synthetic strategy and ensuring exact chemical surface functionality for accurate
comparison.
Gold nanorods and nanoshells have recently been tested in mouse models. Halas, West, and
co-workers have evaluated the photothermal efficacy of PEG-coated nanoshells injected into
tumors in a mouse model. These researchers found that tumors could be ablated by treatment
with light, and the animals remained healthy after more than 90 days, thus pointing to a low
toxicity of nanoconjugates in vivo.[123] A research group investigating the use of CTAB-
functionalized gold nanorods as imaging agents found that the particles were rapidly cleared
from the blood after injection into the tail vein.[124] Another study on very similar nanorod
particles found that they are accumulated in the liver after 72 h.[125] Interestingly, however,

when the surface groups were changed to PEG, very few particles remained in the liver after
72 h, and most were cleared. These initial animal studies are indeed promising, and should
motivate future studies that investigate the biodistribution of gold nanoconjugates as a
function of size, shape, and chemical properties of the ligands.
To date, no cytotoxicity of the DNA-AuNPs has been observed.[25] It is again important to
note that these nanoconjugates have unique size, charge, and surface functionality, with
properties derived from the combination of the DNA and the AuNP. Extensive toxicology
screening of these unique materials will be a necessity, and determining what component or
components of the structure contribute to a biological response will be an exciting endeavor.
Preliminary work in our research group on the innate immune response, (as characterized by
interferon production, one of the first pathways activated in an innate immune response) has
shown little interferon-β production caused by the DNA-AuNPs compared to analogous
molecular DNA.[126] Further work is required to examine any changes in the gene
expression profile that may result from the introduction of these structures. In addition to in
vitro assays, preliminary work to examine biodistribution and toxicity in vivo is now
underway. While polyvalent DNA-AuNPs have already shown utility in cell culture assays,
such animal studies will be required to assess the feasibility of these nanomaterials
becoming possible therapeutic agents.
8.4. Conclusion
Although the properties of colloidal gold have been investigated for over a century, their
application as intracellular agents in living cells emerged only prominently a few years ago.
These investigations have demonstrated that multivalent and/or composite nanomaterials can
provide significant advantages over molecular systems in terms of uptake and efficacy in
cellular models. More fundamentally, these studies have reinforced the underlying concept
in nanotechnology that composition, surface derivatization, charge, size, and shape are all
critical to materials properties, and that this translates into a unique ability to interact with a
biological system such as a cell. The highlighted classes of gold nanoconjugates represent a
small but important sample of possible conjugate materials. The study of these classes
highlights one very important conclusion: Namely, unique nanomaterials must be
investigated and evaluated individually. This is exemplified in the studies of nanoparticle
toxicity, where surface functionalization has repeatedly been shown to be a key parameter
that influences toxicity. If one were to conclude from earlier work using CTAB-
functionalized nanoconjugates that all gold nanoconjugates were toxic, then important
opportunities would have been missed, for example the use of DNA-AuNPs for genetic
regulation[25] or amine-functionalized conjugates for drug delivery,[36] where toxicity has
been shown to be lower than polymer delivery systems.[25] As such, we encourage
investigators to study and evaluate nanoconjugates on a case-by-case basis and avoid
generalization wherever possible.
The preparation and use of functionalized gold nanoconjugates continues to be an extremely
active and important area of research. This field continues to tantalize the chemical research
community with major discoveries as well as new scientific challenges, while also involving
cross-disciplinary investigators including materials scientists, biologists, engineers, and
clinicians. The work carried out thus far provides only a glimpse of the wide range of
potential applications for gold nanoparticles in biology and medicine.

The synthesis of the oligonucleotide gold nanoconjugates: Alkanethiol-terminated
oligonucleotides are added to citrate-stabilized AuNPs, thereby displacing the capping
citrate ligands through formation of a gold–thiol bond. Subsequent addition of a salt shields
repulsion between the strands, thus leading to a dense monolayer of oligonucleotides.

Fluorescent microscopy images of C166-EGFP cells incubated for 48 h with gold
nanoconjugates functionalized with dual-fluorophore-labeled oligonucleotides (3′-Cy3 and
5′-Cy5.5) only reveal fluorescence from Cy5.5 (706–717 nm, upper left). Negligible
fluorescence is observed in the emission range of Cy3 (565–615 nm, upper right).
Transmission and composite overlay images are shown in the lower left and lower right
quadrants, respectively. The arrows indicate the location of the cell. Adapted from Ref. [25],

A) Representative Western blots showing the expression of glyceradlehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in HeLa cells treated with various concentrations and
compositions of the gold nanoconjugates. GAPDH expression is reduced in a dose- and
sequence-dependent manner. α-Tubulin is shown as the loading control. B) Relative
decrease in GAPDH expression in HeLa cells. α-Tubulin was used as a loading control and
for subsequent normalization of GAPDH knockdown. The error bars represent the standard
deviation from at least three Western blots. Adapted from Ref. [102], with permission from

Figure 6.
“Nanoflares” are gold nanoconjugates functionalized with oligonucleotide sequences
complementary to a specific nucleic acid target (messenger RNA) hybridized to short
fluorescent sequences. In the absence of a target the nanoflares are dark, because of
quenching by the gold nanoparticle. In the presence of a target binding displaces the short
flare through the formation of a longer (more energetically favorable) duplex. The result is a
fluorescence signal inside the cell, which indicates the target has been detected. Scale bar:
20 μm. Adapted from Ref. [87], with permission from the American Chemical Society;
