In this article, several applications of nanomaterials in food packaging and food safety are reviewed,
including: polymer/clay nanocomposites as high barrier packaging materials, silver nanoparticles as
potent antimicrobial agents, and nanosensors and nanomaterial-based assays for the detection of food-
relevant analytes (gasses, small organic molecules and food-borne pathogens). In addition to covering
the technical aspects of these topics, the current commercial status and understanding of health impli-
cations of these technologies are also discussed. These applications were chosen because they do not
involve direct addition of nanoparticles to consumed foods, and thus are more likely to be marketed to
the public in the short term.

1. Introduction
Nanotechnology involves the characterization, fabrication and/
or manipulation of structures, devices or materials that have at
least one dimension (or contain components with at least one
dimension) that is approximately 1–100 nm in length. When parti-
cle size is reduced below this threshold, the resulting material
exhibits physical and chemical properties that are signiﬁcantly dif-
ferent from the properties of macroscale materials composed of the
same substance. Research in the nanotechnology ﬁeld has skyroc-
keted over the last decade, and already there are numerous compa-
nies specializing in the fabrication of new forms of nanosized
matter, with anticipated applications that include medical thera-
peutics and diagnostics, energy production, molecular computing
and structural materials. In 2008, nanotechnology demanded over
$15 billion in worldwide research and development money (public
and private) and employed over 400,000 researchers across the
globe [1]. Nanotechnologies are projected to impact at least $3 tril-
lion across the global economy by 2020, and nanotechnology
industries worldwide may require at least 6 million workers to
support them by the end of the decade [1].
Despite the excitement surrounding nanotechnology and the
abundance of funding dollars being poured into it, however, one
industry which has been slow to catch on is the food industry. This
is not so surprising, as public preference for ‘‘natural’’ food prod-
ucts has historically inhibited the implementation of emergent
food technologies, and nanotechnology has been no exception. In-
deed, while public opinion about general nanotechnology applica-
tions has ranged from neutral to slightly positive [2–5], some
studies suggest that consumers remain wary about ‘‘nanofoods’’
[6–9].
Nevertheless, scientists and industry stakeholders have already
identiﬁed potential uses of nanotechnology in virtually every seg-
ment of the food industry (Fig. 1), from agriculture (e.g., pesticide,
fertilizer or vaccine delivery; animal and plant pathogen detection;
and targeted genetic engineering) to food processing (e.g., encap-
sulation of ﬂavor or odor enhancers; food textural or quality
improvement; new gelation or viscosifying agents) to food packag-
ing (e.g., pathogen, gas or abuse sensors; anticounterfeiting de-
vices, UV-protection, and stronger, more impermeable polymer
ﬁlms) to nutrient supplements (e.g., nutraceuticals with higher sta-
bility and bioavailability). Undeniably, the most active area of food
nanoscience research and development is packaging: the global
nano-enabled food and beverage packaging market was 4.13 bil-
lion US dollars in 2008 and has been projected to grow to 7.3 bil-
lion by 2014, representing an annual growth rate of 11.65% [10].
This is likely connected to the fact that the public has been shown
in some studies to be more willing to embrace nanotechnology in
‘‘out of food’’ applications than those where nanoparticles are di-
rectly added to foods [7,11,12].
Despite an explosion of growth in this area, food nanotechnol-
ogy is still a lesser-known subﬁeld of the greater nanotechnology
spectrum, even among professional nanotechnologists. This article

addresses this knowledge deﬁcit by providing a comprehensive re-
view of current developments in nanotechnology as it applies to
foods and food-related systems, focusing speciﬁcally on applica-
tions which are most likely to enjoy consumer acceptance and reg-
ulatory attention in the immediate future. Covered topics include
polymer nanocomposites for stronger, higher barrier packaging
materials, nanoparticle-based antimicrobials, and sensors/assays
that detect contaminants in foods or monitor changes in packaging
conditions or integrity. Speciﬁc health concerns related to these
various applications are also brieﬂy described. The article con-
cludes with a brief overview of the commercial and regulatory out-
look of food nanomaterials.
2. Barrier applications of polymer nanocomposites
When food will not be consumed immediately after production,
it must be contained in a package that serves numerous functions.
In addition to protecting the food from dirt or dust, oxygen, light,
pathogenic microorganisms, moisture, and a variety of other
destructive or harmful substances, the packaging must also be safe
under its intended conditions of use, inert, cheap to produce, light-
weight, easy to dispose of or reuse, able to withstand extreme con-
ditions during processing or ﬁlling, impervious to a host of
environmental storage and transport conditions, and resistant to
physical abuse. This is a tall order for any material to ﬁll.
A critical issue in food packaging is that of migration and per-
meability [13–16]: no material is completely impermeable to
atmospheric gasses, water vapor, or natural substances contained
within the food being packaged or even the packaging material it-
self. In some applications, high barriers to migration or gas diffu-
sion are undesirable, such as in packages for fresh fruits and
vegetables whose shelf life is dependent on access to a continual
supply of oxygen for sustained cellular respiration [15]. Plastics
utilized for carbonated beverage containers, on the other hand,
must have high oxygen and carbon dioxide barriers in order to pre-
vent oxidation and decarbonation of the beverage contents [15]. In
other products, migration of carbon dioxide is far less of an issue
than that of either oxygen or water vapor. As a result of these com-
plexities, food products require sophisticated and remarkably dif-
ferent packaging functions, and the demands on the packaging
industry will only increase as food is transported over increasingly
longer distances between producers and consumers.
Traditional materials for food packaging include metal, ceramic
(glass), and paper (cardboard). While these materials are still used,
the light weight, low cost, ease of processing and formability, and
remarkable diversity in physical properties of organic polymeric
materials makes plastics attractive alternatives for the packaging
of foods. Polymers which are most frequently used for food pack-
aging include, but are not limited to, polyoleﬁns such as polypro-
pylene (PP) and various grades of polyethylene (HDPE, LDPE,
etc.), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polystyrene (PS) and poly-
vinyl chloride (PVC). Though polymers have revolutionized the
food industry and possess numerous advantages over conventional
materials, their major drawback is an inherent permeability to gas-
ses and other small molecules. Some polymers are better than oth-
ers in this regard. PET, for example, provides a good barrier to
oxygen (O2 permeability = 6–8 nmol m1 s1 GPa1) , while high
density polyethylene (HDPE) fares much worse (O2 permeabil-
ity = 200–400 nmol m1 s1 GPa1) [16].1 On the other hand, HDPE
offers a signiﬁcantly better barrier against water vapor than PET [16].
In general, permeability of a polymer to oxygen or moisture is
dependent on a large number of interrelated factors, including:
polarity and structural features of polymeric side chains, hydrogen
bonding characteristics, molecular weight and polydispersity,
degree of branching or cross-linking, processing methodology,
method of synthesis, and degree of crystallinity. Permeability to one
migrant can also be complicated by the presence of other migrants.
For instance, ethylene–vinyl alcohol (EVOH) exhibits quite excel-
lent oxygen transmission rate (OTR) values under dry conditions,
but under very humid conditions (relative humidity >75%) it can
possess OTR values more than an order of magnitude higher due
to swelling of the polymer and plasticization in the presence of dif-
fused water molecules [17,18]. It is noteworthy that bio-derived
polysaccharide (starch) based polymers, which have garnered
attention due to their biodegradability, tend to have an even larger
dependence of their OTR on humidity level, which has severely
limited their usefulness [19]; other thermoplastic biopolymers like
polylactic acid (PLA) or polycarprolactones (PCLs) have good toler-
ance to moisture but less exciting baseline (dry level) OTR values
[19].
Because no known pure polymer exhibits all the desired
mechanical and barrier properties required for every conceivable
food packaging application, complex multilayer ﬁlms or polymer
blends are often utilized. For example, in an application where
ultrahigh oxygen barriers are required over a large humidity range,
a high oxygen barrier, water sensitive material like EVOH can be
sandwiched between two layers composed of a relatively hydro-
phobic polymer such as polyethylene [20–22]. Direct polymer
blending is also a useful approach to achieve desired gas barrier
and mechanical properties that cannot otherwise be attained with
polymer monolayers [19,23–27], and ﬁlms with even better, more
controllable properties might be achievable with smart-blended
coextrusions [28]. Unfortunately, while multilayer ﬁlms and poly-
mer blending have yielded packaging materials with acceptable
gas barrier properties that lack the limitations inherent to many
monolayer ﬁlms composed of ultrahigh barrier polymers, they pos-
sess higher production and material costs, require the use of addi-
tional additives and adhesives that complicate their regulation by
federal agencies, and entail added difﬁculty when it comes to recy-
cling. As a result, there is still a signiﬁcant push in the polymer
industry to generate monolayer ﬁlms with improved mechanical
and gas barrier properties, particularly those which are composed
of biocompatible materials.
Polymer nanocomposites (PNCs) are the latest materials aimed
at solving the aforementioned problems. PNCs are created by dis-
Fig. 1. Nanotechnology has applications in all areas of food science, from
agriculture to food processing to security to packaging to nutrition and neutraceu-
ticals. Some potential applications are shown here. The applications which will be
reviewed in this article are those in the orange quadrant, which are the most likely
to be marketed in the near term.
1 PET and HDPE typically have O2 permeability values ranging from 46 to 62 and
1550 to 3100, respectively, in units of mL mil m2 day1 atm1. See Ref. [16] for
conversion tables for gas permeability values as well as tables of permeability values
and transmission rates for various polymers.

persing an inert, nanoscale ﬁller throughout a polymeric matrix.
Filler materials can include clay and silicate nanoplatelets (vide in-
fra), silica (SiO2) nanoparticles [29–32], carbon nanotubes [33–40],
graphene [41–43], starch nanocrystals [44,45], cellulose-based
nanoﬁbers or nanowhiskers [46–54], chitin or chitosan nanoparti-
cles [55–58] and other inorganics [59–62]. Though enhancing poly-
mer barrier properties is the most obvious application of PNCs in
the food industry, PNCs are also stronger [33,63–74], more ﬂame
resistant [59,63,68,73,75–81] and possess better thermal proper-
ties (e.g., melting points, degradation and glass transition temper-
atures) [64,71,72,82–84] than control polymers which contain no
nanoscale ﬁller; alterations in surface wettability and hydropho-
bicity have also been reported [85]. Some of these physical prop-
erty enhancements can be particularly impressive. For example, a
layer-by-layer assembly technique was used to fabricate a PNC
material composed of clay nanoplatelets dispersed within cross-
linked polyvinyl acetate (PVA) that possessed a modulus (stiffness)
of 106 ± 11 GPa, almost two orders of magnitude larger than ‘‘vir-
gin’’ PVA and comparable to the stiffness of some grades of Kevlar
[86]. A similar fabrication technique was used to engineer clay/
poly(ethyleneimine) PNCs that preserved the weave structure of
cotton fabrics during extended burning times when used as a coat-
ing [87].
In the end, PNCs should offer the food packaging industry better
downgauging opportunities, in addition to cost savings and waste
reductions, due to the smaller amounts of polymer that need to be
used to attain packaging materials with identical or even better
mechanical attributes. Nanocomposites may even offer environ-
mental advantages over conventional plastics: when a nanoﬁller
is dispersed within the bio-compatible polymer PLA, the PLA bio-
nanocomposite actually has a faster rate of biodegradation than
PLA containing no such additives [88].
2.1. Permeability of PNCs
The permeability of polymeric materials to gasses is determined
by the adsorption rate of gas molecules into the matrix at the
atmosphere/polymer boundary and the diffusion rate of adsorbed
gas molecules through the matrix [14,16,89]. The adsorption rate
is generally dependent on the rate of formation of free volume
holes in the polymer created by random (Brownian) or thermal
motions of the polymer chains, and diffusion is caused by jumps
of molecular gas molecules to neighboring (empty) holes. Thus
the permeability of polymer ﬁlms is dependant on free volume
hole sizes, degree of polymer motion, and speciﬁc polymer–poly-
mer and polymer–gas interactions, all of which can be affected
by intrinsic polymer chemistry as well as external properties such
as temperature and pressure. Of course, the overall rate of gas dif-
fusion is also directly dependant on the ﬁlm thickness.
The dispersal of nano-sized ﬁllers into the polymer matrix af-
fects the barrier properties of a homogeneous polymer ﬁlm in
two speciﬁc ways. The ﬁrst way is by creating a tortuous path for
gas diffusion [89]. Because the ﬁller materials are essentially
impermeable
inorganic
crystals,
gas
molecules
must
diffuse
around them rather than taking a (mean) straight line path that lies
perpendicular to the ﬁlm surface. The result is a longer mean path
for gas diffusion through the ﬁlm in the presence of ﬁllers, as illus-
trated in Fig. 2. Essentially, the tortuous path allows the manufac-
turer to attain larger effective ﬁlm thicknesses while using smaller
amounts of polymer.
The effect of dispersed nanomaterials on the mean path length
for gas diffusion has been modeled theoretically. The simplest
model, ﬁrst proposed by Nielsen, assumes that ﬁllers are evenly
dispersed throughout the matrix and take the shape of rectangular
platelets of uniform size, and supposes that the tortuosity of the
path is the only factor inﬂuencing the gas diffusion rate [90]. In
the Nielsen model, the gas permeability is given by
Kcomposite

where the K values represent permeabilities of the composite mate-
rial and of the matrix in the absence of ﬁller, / is the volume frac-
tion of ﬁller and a is the aspect ratio (length divided by width) of
the individual ﬁller particles. This equation shows that as the parti-
cles become more anisotropic or plate-like in shape, the barrier
effectiveness is expected to increase, a prediction which has been
experimentally veriﬁed [89]. In practice, the Nielsen model is valid
only for small loading percentages (/ < 10%), as higher loadings re-
sult in particle agglomeration, which in turn effectively reduces the
mean particle aspect ratio [89] and may affect other properties of
the system such as the amount of polymer available to intercalate
into the nanoclay galleries and the proportion of ‘‘interphase’’ re-
gions in which the nanoclay surface and any organic modiﬁers
interact directly with the polymeric host material [91]. Improve-
ments on the Nielsen model include adjustments for random posi-
tioning of the ﬁller throughout the matrix [92–94], as well as ﬁller
shape (e.g., hexagonal [95] or disk [96,97]), size uniformity [94,98],
angular orientation with respect to the lateral dimension of the ﬁlm
[99,100], degree of agglomeration or stacking [98,101], and high
nanoclay ﬁller contents [91]. Temperature effects have also been
studied [91]. In general all of these models predict that large vol-
ume fractions or large particle aspect ratios are required to reduce
the gas permeability by an appreciable degree. These theoretical
considerations have been reviewed in detail [89] and some of the
more widely utilized models have recently been tested experimen-
tally over a full range (0–100 vol.%) of nanoclay ﬁller content and
modiﬁed accordingly [91].
While tortuosity is usually the primary mechanism by which
nanoﬁllers impact the barrier properties of PNCs, this is not always
the case. The second way that nanoparticulate ﬁllers inﬂuence the
barrier properties is by causing changes to the polymer matrix it-
self at the interfacial regions. If the polymer–nanoparticle interac-
tions are favorable, polymer strands located in close proximity to
each nanoparticle can be partially immobilized. The result is that
gas molecules traveling through these interfacial zones have atten-
uated hopping rates between free volume holes, or altered density
and or size of holes, a fact which has been observed directly via the
use of positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) [89,102–
104]. In addition, the presence of surfactants or other additives
used to efﬁciently incorporate the ﬁller into the matrix can also

clay nanoplatelets into a polymer matrix ﬁlm. In a ﬁlm composed only of polymer
(a), diffusing gas molecules on average migrate via a pathway that is perpendicular
to the ﬁlm orientation. In a nanocomposite (b), diffusing molecules must navigate
around impenetrable particles/platelets and through interfacial zones which have
different permeability characteristics than those of the virgin polymer. The tortuous
pathway increases the mean gas diffusion length and, thus, the shelf-life of
spoilable foods.

affect the diffusivity or solubility of permeants. The effects of the
interfacial regions have been found to be particularly important
in polymer matrices that possess very high native gas permeabili-
ties, such as polyoleﬁns [105]. Attempts have been made to model
the effect of the interfacial regions [89,106,107] on the diffusivity
properties of migrant gasses through polymer ﬁlms, but the rele-
vant parameters are not always easily measurable.
In any case, each PNC system is different and properties can
only predicted generally. These considerations also demonstrate
why nanomaterials have been so successful as ﬁllers for polymer
composites: compared to micro-scale ﬁllers, nanoparticles have
much higher aspect ratios and, due to their high surface area to
volume ratios, the interfacial volume element in a PNC ﬁlm is sig-
niﬁcantly greater than that of a polymer microcomposite created
from the same materials. It is also worth mentioning that gas
transport properties can also be modiﬁed in the absence of exoge-
nous nanoﬁllers; semicrystalline polymers such as PET and PE have
gas permeabilities that are directly related to their degree of crys-
tallinity due to the fact that nanocrystalline regions within the
polymer matrix increase tortuosity of gas diffusion and effect
changes to the gas transport regions of the interfacial regions
[108,109]. In other words, crystalline regions of semicrystalline
polymers act as nanoscale ﬁllers. Unfortunately, polymer crystal-
linity is difﬁcult to measure accurately,2 and is dependent on
numerous processing and structural factors [109], although some re-
cent efforts at controlling polymer crystallinity in nanoscale layered
assemblies has yielded some impressively high oxygen barriers
[110].
2.2. Structure and barrier behavior of clay and silicate nanocomposites
By far the most promising nanoscale ﬁllers for PNCs are nano-
platelets composed of clays or other silicate materials. The popu-
larity of nanoclays in food contact applications derives from their
low cost, effectiveness, high stability and (alleged) benignity. The
prototypical clay utilized in PNC applications is montmorillonite
(MMT) [(Na,Ca)0.33(Al,Mg)2(Si4O10)(OH)2nH2O)], a soft 2:1 layered
phyllosilicate clay comprised of highly anisotropic platelets sepa-
rated by thin layers of water (Fig. 3). The platelets have an average
thickness of 1 nm and average lateral dimensions ranging be-
tween a few tens of nm to several lm. Each platelet contains a
layer of aluminum or magnesium hydroxide octahedra sandwiched
between two layers of silicon oxide tetrahedra. The faces of each
platelet have a net negative charge, which causes the interstitial
water layer (known as the gallery) to attract cations (Ca2+, Mg2+,
Na+, etc.) and allows for the construction of multi-layer polymer
assemblies under appropriate conditions (Section 2.3).
Individual MMT clay platelets possess surface areas in excess of
750 m2/g and aspect ratios on the order of 100–500 [111]. These
structural characteristics contribute to MMT’s excellent utility as
a ﬁller material for PNCs, typically giving rise to impressive in-
creases in polymer strength and barrier properties with only a
few wt.% added to the polymer matrix. However, because they
have such large surface energies, clay nanoplatelets tend to stick
together, particularly when dispersed in nonpolar polymer envi-
ronments. Agglomeration of clay platelets leads to tactoid struc-
tures
(microcomposites)
with
reduced
aspect
ratios
and,
according to the Nielsen model, reduced barrier efﬁciencies. When
polymer–clay interactions are more favorable, or when steps are
taken (e.g., sonication [112]) to disaggregate the platelets, interca-
lated
and
fully
exfoliated
PNC
structures
are
formed
[64,111,113,114]. Intercalated morphologies are characterized by
moderate intrusion of polymer strands into the gallery volume,
and the shape of the layered stack is preserved. In fully exfoliated
structures, on the other hand, individual platelets are well sepa-
rated and have extremely favorable interactions with the polymer
matrix [115]. These various nanoclay morphologies are depicted in
Fig. 4.
MMT is not the only layer silicate material utilized in nanocom-
posite materials. Related clays such as kaolinite, hectrite and sap-
onite can also be used in PNC applications and the natural
structure of these various clays can play an important role in
PNC properties. For instance, polyimide nanocomposites contain-
ing 2 wt.% of hectrite, saponite, montmorillonite and synthetic
mica have water vapor permeabilities of 12.3, 10, 5.86 and
1.16 g mm m2 day1 compared to 12.9 g mm m2 day1 for the
Fig. 3. Structure of montmorillonite (phyllosilicate clay).
2 In fact, gas transport rates may be an effective means of estimating polymer
crystallinity [106].

virgin polymer [116]. Theoretical modeling of this data shows that
the variation in H2O permeability as a function of clay type corre-
sponds well to the natural platelet lateral dimensions for each clay
(i.e., there is a nanoplatelet aspect ratio dependency). A similar re-
sult has been obtained for oxygen permeability in poly(lactic acid)
nanocomposites [117].
The manner in which the polymer–clay nanocomposite (PCNC)
is fabricated can play a large role in how the clay platelets are dis-
tributed throughout the matrix and, therefore, the barrier proper-
ties
of
the
resulting
materials.
Melt
processing,
in
situ
polymerization and solution-based processing techniques may be
more or less suitable for different ﬁller/polymers systems [118–
120], and an excellent review [121] discusses these relationships
extensively. As one example, Yeh et al. showed that when MMT
platelets are present during in situ polymerization of poly(methyl-
methacrylate) (PMMA), the resulting MMT/PMMA PNCs have bet-
ter clay exfoliation and thus signiﬁcantly lower OTR and water
vapor transmission rate (WVTR) values (compared to virgin poly-
mer) than when the MMT was incorporated into commercially
purchased PMMA by solution dispersion [122]. Pereira et al. re-
cently showed that the type of extrusion method also can have
an enormous effect on the ﬁnal barrier properties of a MMT/poly-
amide PCNC ﬁlm, with OTR rates varying over three orders of mag-
nitude for ﬁlms made of the exact same polymer and ﬁller
materials [123]; a similar dependency of mechanical properties
on processing method for MMT/polyamide has also been observed
[123,124]. In this regard, it is clear that controlling the nanoparticle
dispersion morphology (i.e.,
tactoid, intercalate, exfoliate) is
important, as it has an enormous inﬂuence on the bulk properties
of the PCNC materials [73]. For instance, Gorrasi et al. [125] studied
the correlation between nanoparticle morphology and water vapor
barrier of a series of MMT/polycaprolactone (PCL) composites, and
found that while PCL PCNCs possessing the tactoid (microcompos-
ite) and intercalated nanoparticle structures exhibited diffusion
parameters close to those of virgin PCL, fully exfoliated structures
led to values that were roughly two orders of magnitude lower.
Unfortunately, efﬁcient delamination of platelets to form fully
exfoliated morphologies is hindered by the fact that clay particles
are hydrophilic and many polymers of interest (PET, PE, PP, etc.)
are hydrophobic [64,120]. Good dispersibility of nanoclay platelets
in hydrophobic matrices is typically achieved by functionalizing
the polar clay surface with organic ammonium ions bearing long
aliphatic chains [70,82,105,126,127]. Note that these organofunc-
tional groups need not be passive spectators: efﬁcient exfoliation
of MMT in PMMA and PS polymers can be achieved by functionali-
zing the MMT particles with an organoammonium ion bearing two
styrene groups, which directly participate in an in situ polymeriza-
tion of the matrix [128].
Not surprisingly, PCNC barrier properties depend on the type of
organic compatibilizer utilized due to varying effects on nanopar-
ticle morphology. For example, moisture permeability of a MMT/
epoxy PCNC material using octadecylamine as an organic modiﬁer
is lower than when the modiﬁer is a quarternary alkylamine [129];
in the latter case, dispersed MMT nanoparticles possess a mean
interlayer distance (d-spacing) of 3 nm, compared to the 8 nm
mean interlayer separation of MMT particles functionalized with
octadecylamine, resulting in less efﬁcient exfoliation and poorer
barrier behavior. A more systematic demonstration of the inﬂuence
of the modiﬁer on degree of MMT exfoliation and, hence, gas bar-
rier properties is provided by Osman et al., who utilized quaternary
ammonium modiﬁers bearing either one, two, three or four long al-
kyl (octadecyl) chains [130]: when MMT/polyethylene nanocom-
posites were fabricated using modiﬁers having more numerous
long alkyl chains, the clay platelets generally had larger d-spacing
values (inter-platelet separation) due to steric interactions, and
thus better gas barriers. MMT clays with better cation exchange
capacities also exhibited better degrees of exfoliation within the
polymer matrix due to similar steric considerations. When all of
the data-sets are combined, a clear inverse correlation between
d-spacing and oxygen transmission rate is apparent, as shown in
Fig. 5. The Osman study is a great example of the power of chem-
istry and nanotechnology: a clear understanding of the factors in-
volved,
combined
with
the
unique
chemical
properties
of
nanoscale particles, can lead to impressive control over the physi-
cal properties of macroscopic materials.
The ﬁrst successful example of a polymer–clay nanocomposite
(PCNC) was a nylon-6 MMT hybrid material developed by the Toy-
ota Corporation in 1986 [131]. The initial interest in PCNC materi-
als stemmed from gains in strength and ﬁre retardancy, and it was
not until over a decade after their ﬁrst appearance in the literature
that their impressive barrier properties were fully realized and
PCNC-based food packaging materials development commenced
[118]. Over the last 25 years, hundreds of clay-based PNC systems
have been reported, and nanoscale clay materials have been suc-
cessfully incorporated into virtually every important class of syn-
thetic or natural polymer. This body of work is especially
exciting in light of the evident success in using PCNCs to improve
the mechanical and barrier properties of biocompatible polymers,
which in their virgin states are either too brittle or water-sensitive
to enjoy widespread commercial use in the food industry. Some

clay/polymer examples are provided in Table 1 along with selected
oxygen and moisture permeability data. This list is not an
exhaustive representation of the work that has been done in this
area, and direct comparisons between tabulated values should be
avoided due to the dependence of transmission rates on numerous
factors which are not disclosed in this table; this table is only
meant to illustrate the range of polymer classes that have been
studied. Readers interested in a more comprehensive account of
speciﬁc polymer systems, either biocompatible or otherwise,
should consult any of the excellent reviews on the subject
[19,64,68,73,111,113,118–120,132–137].
2.3. Brick wall layer-by-layer assemblies
Most PNC fabrication techniques offer only partial control over
the ﬁller dispersion morphology within the polymer matrix. As Ta-
ble 1 showed, while improvements in oxygen and moisture vapor
barriers can be achieved in virtually any polymer by clay nanopar-
ticle dispersion, with only a few exceptions these improvements
are generally modest. The complicating factor here is attaining
complete exfoliation of dispersed clays, which limits the achiev-
able diffusion path tortuosity. While advances have been made to-
ward understanding the factors which inﬂuence the degree of clay
platelet exfoliation in PNC ﬁlms, these relationships are complex
and difﬁcult to control in practice. Therefore top-down approaches
to PNC fabrication are limited in their ability to provide consis-
tently impressive improvements in oxygen and moisture vapor
permeabilities.
Layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly [157–161] is a bottom-up strat-
egy to fabricate multilayer ﬁlm structures with pre-deﬁned com-
ponent
organization
at
the
nanoscale.
Multilayer
ﬁlms
are
constructed as follows (Fig. 6). A prepared substrate (quartz or
polymer such as PET, e.g.) is submerged in a solution of a positively
charged polymer, rinsed, dried, and then submerged in a solution
of negatively charged clay platelets. Each cycle of alternating sub-
merging leads to the formation of a single clay-polymer bilayer,
and cycles are repeated until the desired number of bilayers is
achieved. Bilayers are held together by electrostatic attraction be-
tween the polymer and clay layers, which have opposite polarity.
The impressive ﬂame retardancy [87] and strength [86] of
PCNC materials fabricated through LBL methods has already been
mentioned. PCNCs formed through LBL assembly have been com-
pared to nacre (mother of pearl) [86], a natural layered mineral/
biopolymer substance which is thought to be among the strongest
mineral materials produced in nature. LBL-assembled nanoclay/
polymer or nano-silica/polymer materials have been found to have
superior wettability [162], anisotropic ion transport [163] and
anti-reﬂectivity [164]. For food packaging applications, the most
exciting attribute of these materials is their barrier properties,
such that they have been envisioned to be potentially useful as
ultrathin, ﬂexible, high gas barrier coatings for conventional
polymer ﬁlms.
Grunlan and coworkers have pioneered the use of LBL assembly
to fabricate polymer/clay ﬁlms with high structural order and tail-
orable oxygen barriers. In two recent studies, they reported LBL
assembled
ﬁlms
of
MMT/poly(acrylamide)
[165]
and
MMT/
Fig. 5. Effect of clay organic modiﬁer on the macroscopic properties of PCNCs. MMT clays were chemically modiﬁed with trimethyl-(octadecyl)ammonium [h], dimethyl-
di(octadecyl)ammonium [s], methyl-tri(octadecyl)ammonium [4] and tetra(octadecyl)ammonium [r] and dispersed within a linear high density poly(ethylene) (HDPE)
matrix. Separation between individual platelets (d-spacing) increased as the number of long alkyl chains on the modiﬁer increased from 1 to 4 due to steric interactions (a). A
plot of measured oxygen permeability coefﬁcient as a function of d-spacing for the fabricated nanocomposites reveals a clear inverse correlation between these factors (b).
Colors in the scatter plot represent MMT clays with various cation exchange capacity (CEC) [black: 680 leq/g; red: 880 leq/g; green: 900 leq/g; blue: 1000 leq/g]; a higher
CEC results in higher packing density and a larger d-spacing. All fabricated PCNCs have better oxygen barriers than the virgin polymer, represented by the pink line. The
dashed line is meant only to guide the eye. A TEM image of the 900 leq/g, dimethyl-di(octadecyl)ammonium sample at 2.8% loading (c) shows good exfoliation of the MMT
layers in this system. The image in (c) is taken from Osman, et al. [130] (www.dx.doi.org/10.1039/B417673A). Reproduced by permission of The Royal Society of Chemistry.

poly(ethylene imine) [166] which have oxygen permeabilities and
transmission rates below instrument detection thresholds while
only being a fraction of a micron thick. For instance, an oxygen per-
meability of <2  109 cc m1 day1 atm1 (below the instrument
detection limit) was achieved with a 70 bilayer ﬁlm only
230.75 nm thick, as illustrated in Fig. 6. Oxygen permeability was
also found to be dependent both on the number of bilayers in
the ﬁlm as well as the pH of the polymer solution, giving rise to
materials whose oxygen transport properties were tailorable to
any desired value within a broad range. More impressively, in a fol-
low up study [167], the Grunlan group used a three component
(MMT/PAA/PEI) system as the basis for a ﬂexible LBL assembled
ﬁlm which at a mere 51 nm thick (four MMT/PEI/PAA/PEI quadlay-
ers) exhibited virtually undetectable oxygen transmission when
coated on a PET substrate. For comparison to these values, the oxy-
gen permeability of a 25,400 nm (1 mil) thick ﬁlm of EVOH, gener-
ally considered to be one of the best food-packaging polymers
when high oxygen barriers are required, has an oxygen permeabil-
ity of 2.76–18.70  106 cc m1 day1 atm1 (measured at 0% rela-
tive humidity), depending on the degree of EVOH hydroxyl
functional group content [16]. In other words, the LBL-assembled
nanocomposite ﬁlms have oxygen permeabilities several orders
of magnitude lower than a 1 mil EVOH ﬁlm while at the same time
being over four orders of magnitude thinner.
Note that while the oxygen permeability of LBL-assembled PNC
materials are moisture sensitive, they are far less so than conven-
tional polymers. For example, the OTR at 95% relative humidity of a
LBL-assembled clay/poly(acrylamide) PCNC remains more than an
order of magnitude lower than bare PET. Furthermore, when this
system is combined with a high moisture barrier (poly(chlorotri-
ﬂuoroethylene)), an OTR below 0.005 cc m2 day1 atm1 can be
maintained even under very humid (95%) conditions [165].
Cross-linking has also been shown to signiﬁcantly improve mois-
ture insensitivity of these LBL-assembled nancomposites [167].
The extremely high oxygen barriers exhibited by LBL-assembled
clay/polymer materials results from the ‘‘brick wall’’ structure
achievable by fabricating the nanocomposites in this fashion
[81,165]. The clay platelets are organized in neat monolayers with
a well-deﬁned polymeric region in between each monolayer
(Fig. 6, inset). This is an efﬁcient way to promote extensive exfoli-
ation of the clay particles within the polymer matrix. In addition,
because each particle is essentially oriented perpendicular to the
gas migration direction, the tortuosity of the migration path is
optimized, as predicted by theory [89]. Such precise control over
the clay particle orientation and morphology within a polymer ma-
trix would be nearly impossible to achieve with conventional pro-
cessing techniques, and thus for PNC food packaging materials that
possess good optical clarity and the highest oxygen barriers, LBL
fabrication methodologies or other bottom-up strategies may be
the wave of the future.
2.4. Current commercial status, safety and outlook
Because PCNC packaging materials are relatively inexpensive to
manufacture, there are already numerous companies that have

made them commercially available. Companies such as Nanocor™
offer a wide variety of polymer nanocomposites for purchase in
pellet form, and several trademarked product lines exist, such as
Aegis™(Honeywell Polymers), Durethan (LANXESS Deutschland
GmbH), Imperm (ColorMatrix Corp.), nanoTuff™(Nylon Corpora-
tion of America) and NanoSeal™(NanoPack, Inc.). A more complete
summary of active companies in the ﬁeld is provided elsewhere
[136].
Most commercially available PCNC products are marketed to-
ward a very speciﬁc application, including several in the food
and beverage industry. PCNC packaging materials have, for exam-
ple, become popular with beverage manufacturers, such as Miller
Brewing Company [133], which has used them to manufacture
plastic bottles possessing both high barriers to oxygen and carbon
dioxide migration. Other interested parties in PCNC technology in-
clude the US Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engi-
neering Center (NSRDEC), which has invested considerable time
and money researching the potential use of PNC plastics to package
meals ready to eat (MREs) for soldiers; in addition to currently cre-
ating an enormous amount of waste, MREs have incredibly strin-
gent shelf-life and robustness requirements which PCNC-based
packages may be uniquely able to satisfy [168].
Given the number of studies that cite food packaging as a likely
endpoint for PCNC research, the number of researchers who have
investigated these materials in shelf life or safety experiments
using real food components is surprisingly small. One study
showed that PCNCs based on PET, PHBV and PHB at 5 wt.% exhibit
relative permeabilities (Pcomposite/Ppolymer) of d-limonene, a key ar-
oma compound in citrus fruits, of 3.2, 1.6 and 8.8, respectively,
indicating that PCNC packaging materials are less likely than con-
ventional plastics to scalp ﬂavors, colors or aroma from foods
[141]. More relevant to behavior with real food systems is a 2007
study [151] which showed that total microbial and mold counts
on apple slices decreased signiﬁcantly over a period of 10 days
when packaged in CaCO3/iPP PNC ﬁlms, as opposed to apples
stored in neat isotactic PP, which experienced an increase of total
mesophilic microﬂora over the same time period. The study also
showed that the apples stored in PNC packaging ripened better
due to ethylene gas retention and exhibited less oxidation than
those stored in conventional PP packages.
Of some concern is the safety of packaging materials made with
PNCs. The main risk of consumer exposure to PNC packaging is
through migration3 of nanoparticles or other substances from pack-
ages into packaged foods which are then eaten, yet migration studies
of PNC materials are ambiguous and few in number. A 2005 study
[169] showed that vegetables in contact with clay/starch nanocom-
posite ﬁlms exhibited no trends in their iron and magnesium con-
tent, but manifested elevated levels of silicon; the authors alleged
that the results demonstrated either no appreciable migration of
the constituent elements of the clay nanoparticles into the food, or
migration within the limits set forth by then-current European Un-
ion (EU) regulations. A separate study showed that Uvitex OB, a com-
monly used additive to polyoleﬁns approved for food contact use in
Europe (2002/72/EEC), has very low release into oil-based and aque-
ous-based food simulants from a MMT/wheat-gluten PNC ﬁlm, com-
pared to up to 60% loss in LLDPE ﬁlms subjected to the same test
[170]. This MMT/wheat-gluten ﬁlm also permitted aluminum and
silicon migration into food simulants that was allegedly well within
the limits set forth by European regulations, although the authors of
this study were careful to point out that the more difﬁcult quantiﬁ-
cation of nanoparticle migration should ideally be performed. Final-
ly, a 2010 paper revealed that diffusion of triclosan and trans-,trans-
1,4-diphenyl-1,3-dibutadiene (DPBD), two other common additives,
was slower in poly(amide)/clay PCNCs than in neat poly(amide)
[171].
While the above studies demonstrate that PCNCs may slow
down the migration of potentially harmful additives into foods,
the body of safety research is at this time fragmentary and incom-
plete. A theoretical treatment has predicted that montmorillonite
particles with surface modiﬁcation embedded in various polymer
matrices are unlikely to migrate into foods from a polymer nano-
composite food contact material in any detectable quantities
[172]. Nevertheless, more comprehensive experimental studies
need to be done in PCNCs made from common-use food-contact
polymers such as PET, especially since some food and beverage
companies are already utilizing these materials in their products.
More importantly, the availability of clay nanoparticle toxicology
data is still lacking, as are developments in strategies to detect
and categorize clay and other nanoparticles in complex food matri-
ces. One study determined that exfoliated silicate nanoclays exhib-
ited low cytotoxicity and genotoxicity, even when part of a diet fed
to
rats
(measured
acute
oral
toxicity,
median
lethal
dose,
LD50 > 5700 mg/kg body weight under the conditions probed)
[173]; however the authors of this study only tested a single clay
type and morphology, so it is unclear whether it can be applied
in a general sense. Furthermore, it has recently been shown [170]
that PCNC ﬁlms exhibit enhanced migration of nanoclay compo-
nents into food simulants when the ﬁlms undergo high-pressure
treatment, a food preservation/sterilization method that is becom-
ing increasingly popular; a follow up study [174] demonstrated
that MMT clays undergo undetermined structural or chemical
changes under pressures as low as 300 MPa and concluded that
‘‘such changes should be taken into consideration when binging
[sic] montmorillonite–polymer composites into contact with food.’’
As a result of these considerations, while PCNCs may represent
the next revolution in food packaging technology, there are still
steps that need to be taken in order to ensure that consumers
are protected from any potential hazards these materials pose.
3. Silver nanoparticles and nanocomposites as antimicrobial
food packaging materials
Silver has a long history of being used as an antimicrobial agent
in food and beverage storage applications. Numerous ancient soci-
eties stored wine and water in silver vessels. Web searches on the
historic uses of silver reveal anecdotal reports of early settlers plac-
ing silver dollars or silver spoons at the bottom of milk and water
bottles to prolong shelf life, and of seafaring ships or airliners lining
their water tanks with silver to keep water potable for long periods
of time. Silver was the sterilization agent for water on the Russian
MIR space station and on NASA space shuttles [175], and silver’s
broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and relative low cost have
made it a candidate as the active disinfecting agent for water in
developing countries [176,177]. In 2009, the FDA modiﬁed the food
additive regulations to permit the direct addition of silver nitrate
as a disinfectant to commercially bottled water at concentrations
not to exceed 17 lg/kg [178].
Beyond food applications, silver has long been used as an anti-
septic. Hippocrates, the ‘‘father of medicine’’, advocated the sprin-
kling of silver powder on ulcers to expedite healing [179], and
silver has been used since World War I (and continues to be used)
in wound dressings. Pencils or sticks of hardened silver nitrate (lu-
nar caustic or lapis infernalis) were considered essential items in a
surgeon’s chest as early as the 1600s and silver nitrate solutions
were used to treat burn victims of the Hindenberg disaster [180].
Though the use of silver as an antimicrobial temporarily fell out
of favor after the proliferation of chemicals such as Penicillin,

molecules through polymer ﬁlms.

interest was revived in the 1960s [181] and silver-based pharma-
ceuticals continue to be used today as topical and ophthalmic dis-
infectants. Silver sulfadiazine is still considered the treatment of
choice for burn victims [182].
Silver has numerous advantages over other antimicrobial
agents. Compared to molecular antimicrobials, which are generally
targeted to speciﬁc organism classes, silver is broad spectrum and
toxic (to varying degrees) to numerous strains of bacteria, fungi, al-
gae, and possibly some viruses. Being an element, silver is shelf sta-
ble for long periods of time. Conventional wisdom regards silver as
safe to humans and other higher order organisms when used
responsibly, and silver-based pharmaceuticals have few if any
acute or chronic known side-effects at FDA-permitted doses. Silver
is reasonably effective at penetrating bioﬁlms, which has been a
drawback to many molecular antimicrobials [183]. Furthermore,
though bacterial strains which manifest silver-resistance are
known and these mechanisms have been studied [175], some
researchers have suggested that silver may be less susceptible to
the
buildup
of
resistance
than
molecular
antimicrobials
[184,185]. This remains an area of some uncertainty. Even so, how-
ever, the explosion of interest in silver as a broad-spectrum antimi-
crobial agent during the last two decades may be in part due to the
proliferation of resistance to strong molecular antimicrobials; in
that respect, silver has been shown [186,187] to be an effective
bacteriocide against antimicrobial-resistant bacterial strains (e.g.,
MRSA), which have become a concern [188] in hospitals.
Yet perhaps the largest advantage of silver antimicrobials is that
silver can be easily incorporated into numerous materials such as
textiles and plastics, making it especially useful for applications
where broad spectrum, sustained antimicrobial activity is desir-
able but where traditional antimicrobials would be impractical.
This is not only advantageous to the food industry, where silver-
containing plastics have been incorporated into everything from
refrigerator liners [189] to cutting boards [190,191] to food storage
containers [192,193], but it has also been revolutionary to the
medical device industry, which has seen a proliferation of silver-
coated
urinary
catheters
[194,195],
cardiovascular
implants
[196,197], esophageal tubes [198,199], bandages [200,201], su-
tures [202] and other instruments [203,204] on which bacterial
growth compromises patient survival. To date, the FDA has ap-
proved over a dozen silver-containing zeolites or other substances
for use as food contact materials4 for the purpose of disinfection, as
well as numerous silver-coated medical devices.
Despite the long history of silver as an antimicrobial, the mech-
anism of this activity remains a matter of active research. The gen-
eral explanation offered [185] is that silver kills by at least one of
the following mechanisms: (a) interference with vital cellular pro-
cesses by binding to sulfhydryl or disulﬁde functional groups on
the surfaces of membrane proteins and other enzymes; (b) disrup-
tion of DNA replication; and (c) oxidative stress through the catal-
ysis
of
reactive
oxygen
species
(ROS)
formation.
However,
controversy exists regarding which of these mechanisms is most
important. For instance, one study [205] presented evidence which
showed that silver binding speciﬁcally to membrane proteins dis-
rupts ion and proton transport across the membrane, while an-
other found that Ag ions permeate to the cellular interior, where
they interfere with ribosomal activity and disrupt the production
of several key enzymes responsible for energy production [206].
With respect to interference of DNA replication, cell wall damage
resulting from silver binding to membrane proteins and DNA con-
densation in Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus has been ob-
served; the condensation of DNA in response to the presence of Ag
ions has been cited as a defense mechanism, which, while protect-
ing the DNA from harm, limits the ability of cells to self-replicate
[207]. In contrast, a separate report asserted that Ag complexes
of glutamic and tartaric acids actively interfere with DNA unwind-
ing, and suggested that Ag ion binding to enzymes and membrane
proteins is a comparatively minor contributor to silver’s antimicro-
bial effect [208]. Gram-negative bacteria (e.g., E. coli) are generally
more susceptible to silver treatment than Gram-positive bacteria
(e.g., S. aureus) because transport of positively charged silver ions
across the thicker, peptidoglycan-rich outer membranes of Gram-
positive bacteria is slow relative to transport across the thinner
membranes of Gram-negative specimens [207]. Finally, there is
evidence that the antibacterial activity of silver zeolites derives
from silver’s ability to catalyze the production of reactive oxygen
species, which causes cell death by creating oxidative stress
[209]; in support of this idea, antioxidant rich Bacillus spores are
highly resistant to silver antimicrobials, whereas vegetative and
relatively anti-oxidant poor Bacillus cells are quite vulnerable
[210]. It is certainly possible that all of these mechanisms contrib-
ute to the antimicrobial activity of silver, which would explain its
broad effectiveness as well as the infrequent reports of silver-resis-
tant bacterial strains.
3.1. Antimicrobial activity of silver nanoparticles
It was inevitable given the history of silver as an antimicrobial
that the effectiveness of nanoparticulate silver at killing or pre-
venting the growth of microbes would eventually be tested. Since
the earliest published reports of the antimicrobial properties of sil-
ver colloids, silver nanoparticles (AgNP) have been found to be po-
tent agents against numerous species of bacteria, including: E. coli
[211–229],
Enterococcus
faecalis
[214,222,229],
Staphylococcus
(aureus
[214,220,222,223,225,226,228,229]
and
epidermidis
[214,222]), Vibrio cholerae [213,220], Pseudomonas (aeruginosa
[213,214,222], putida [230], ﬂuorescens [229,231] and oleovorans
[232]), Shigella ﬂexneri [220], Bacillus (anthracis [223], subtilis
[219] and cereus [229]), Proteus mirabilis [223], Salmonella enterica
Typhimurium [213,220,225,229], Micrococcus luteus [225], Listeria
monocytogenes [229] and Klebsiella pneumoniae [214,222,229].
AgNPs are also effective against strains of these organisms that
are resistant to potent chemical antimicrobials, including MRSA,
MRSE, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and extended-
spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL) producing Klebsiella [214,222]. In
addition,
AgNPs
are
toxic
to
fungi
(e.g.,
Candida
albicans
[223,229,233,234], Aspergillus niger [229,232], Trichophyton ment-
agrophytes [233] and yeast isolated from Bovine mastitis [228]), al-
gae (e.g., Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [235]) and phytoplankton
(e.g., Thalassiosira weissﬂogii [236,237]), and are inhibitory to at
least two viruses (HIV [238] and monkeypox [239]).
There is some disagreement over the manner in which AgNPs
are toxic to bacterial cells. The most conservative viewpoint is that
silver atoms detach from the surfaces of AgNPs and cause cellular
damage by the exact same mechanisms observed for conventional
silver antimicrobials. Some studies which show that AgNPs are
more toxic than an equivalent amount of dissociated silver ion cite
the ‘‘Trojan Horse’’ model for engineered nanoparticle toxicity
[240], whereby AgNPs act as efﬁcient vehicles to deliver a large
quantity of silver ions to the interior of cells in a short period of
time. Support for the hypothesis that AgNPs are simply carriers
for Ag+ is provided by a study which showed that AgNPs are inef-
fective at slowing the growth of Ag+-resistant E. coli strains [217].
In addition, E. coli cells exposed to 9 nm AgNPs [216] exhibited
4 There are presently 17 silver-containing substances approved by the FDA for
contact with foods resulting from successful Food Contact Notiﬁcations (FCNs). These
include Food Contact Substances 1, 47, 193, 248, 270, 275, 294, 296, 351, 430, 432,
433, 434, 476, 535, 697, and 793. Of these, only number 430 (a colorant) is not related
to the antimicrobial properties of silver. A list of FDA approved Food Contact
Substances is currently available at http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodIngredientsPack-
aging/FoodContactSubstancesFCS/ucm116567.htm. The above list resulted from a
search string of ‘‘silver’’.

the same disruption to trans-membrane potentials and depleted
ATP levels observed earlier [205] in E. coli cells exposed to AgNO3,
albeit at absolute molar concentrations three orders of magnitude
lower (lM vs. mM). Importantly, the bactericidal effect is clearly
related to the chemical nature of silver, as similarly sized gold
nanoparticles have no antimicrobial activity [228].
While AgNPs do likely serve as a source of Ag+ ions, they may
have additional antimicrobial mechanisms. For instance, when nor-
malizing for released Ag+ concentration, AgNPs have been found to
be more toxic to algae than equivalent dosages of AgNO3 [235]. Con-
trasting the study cited above [217], a separate report found that
AgNPs had great effectiveness against silver resistant strains of P.
mirabilis and E. coli and highlighted the fact that particles of differ-
ent sizes, shapes or other characteristics may behave differently,
even in the same system [223]. There is also evidence that AgNP
surfaces efﬁciently catalyze the formation of free radicals in bacte-
rial cells, which can cause cell death through oxidative stress [228].
Yet probably the most striking evidence that AgNPs are toxic to
microorganisms via mechanisms that are different than Ag ions
comes from an investigation by Morones et al. [213], which
showed that the concentration of Ag+ ions released from AgNPs un-
der the tested conditions was too low to account completely for
toxicity of AgNPs. More importantly, these authors were able to
demonstrate that AgNPs bind to membrane proteins, forming pits
and causing other morphological changes (Fig. 7); AgNPs were also
found to react with the phosphorous groups of DNA. Morphological
changes (pitting) in cellular membranes as a result of bacterial
AgNP exposure were independently observed by Sondi and Salo-
pek-Sondi [227], who further speculated that AgNP binding to
membrane surfaces causes leeching of lipopolysacchrides and a
subsequent loss of structural integrity and impermeability. The pit-
ted membranes thus become more porous, which disrupts ion and
molecular transport and also catalyzes the entry of additional
AgNPs into the cellular interior where they can cause further dam-
age to DNA and other cellular components.
Aside from differences in susceptibility between bacterial spe-
cies (particularly between Gram-negative and Gram-positive spec-
imens [228]), the quantitative toxicity of AgNPs to bacteria varies
from study to study and appears to be dependent on numerous fac-
tors. For instance, studies have shown that the toxicity of AgNPs in-
crease signiﬁcantly as the nanoparticle diameter decreases [212–
214,217,226,241,242] due to the fact that smaller nanoparticles
have larger relative surface areas for Ag+ release, have higher pro-
tein binding efﬁciencies, and pass through pores in bacterial mem-
branes more easily. Nanoparticle shape is also an important factor
[218]: triangular AgNPs have better bactericidal properties against
E. coli than spherical or rod-shaped particles, which is attributed to
the variation in percentage of {1 1 1} vs. {1 0 0} surfaces5 present in
nanoparticles of each respective shape (Fig. 7). It is thought that
{1 1 1} surfaces have better binding efﬁciency to sulfur groups of cel-
lular components [213]. AgNP surface charge [217], solubility and
degree
of
agglomeration
[217,227],
and
surface
coating
[222,224,243] also inﬂuence the antimicrobial properties, and AgNPs
may also act synergistically with other present chemicals (e.g., ampi-
cillin) for ampliﬁed effect [225]. Unfortunately, in most studies
AgNPs are poorly characterized and/or produced by methods which
yield nanoparticles of highly nonuniform shape and size, which com-
plicates the elucidation of important structure–function relation-
ships.
Additionally,
the
speciﬁc
proteins
on
various
bacterial
proteins that are more or less susceptible to AgNP reactivity are only
recently beginning to be identiﬁed [224].
In summary, it is clear that AgNPs are potent broad spectrum
antimicrobials: minimum inhibitory concentrations of 2–4 lg/mL
for AgNPs with diameters 45–50 nm against E. coli, V. cholerae, S.
ﬂexneri, and at least one strain of S. aureus, have been reported,
which rivals the bactericidal properties of penicillin against nonre-
sistant strains [220]. Furthermore, that potency can be easily
manipulated through the unique physical effects offered by
nanomaterials. For instance, Akhaven and Ghaderi [244] showed
that when silver nanowires are subjected to external electric ﬁelds,
they have 18.5–63% better antimicrobial potency due to enhanced
silver ion production at the wire termini. Also, photoexcitation of
AgNPs coated with a thin (1–2 nm) layer of porous silica at visible
light frequencies which are in resonance with AgNP surface plas-
mon bands has been shown by Fuertes et al. [245] to enhance anti-
microbial activity against E. coli signiﬁcantly, either through
photosensitized ROS generation or photocatalyzed silver ion re-
lease; this effect is also reversible, providing a portal into photo-
switchable antimicrobial behavior. Studies such as these imply
that if intelligently-designed silver nanostructures are incorpo-
rated within food storage containers, the application of an external
electric ﬁeld or light source might be able to be used as a control-
lable and noninvasive sterilization method.
3.2. Polymer nanocomposites containing silver nanoparticles
One of the biggest advantages of inorganic nanoparticles over
molecular antimicrobials is the ease with which the former can
be incorporated into polymers to form functional antimicrobial
Fig. 7. Mechanisms of Silver Nanoparticle Bacteriocidicity. (A and B) Silver
nanoparticles (AgNPs) are lethal to bacteria in part because they damage cell
membranes. The ﬁgure shows pictures from separate studies demonstrating
adherence of AgNPs to and subsequent pitting of the membrane surface of E. coli.
(C) Due at least in part to damage of cell membranes, the presence of AgNPs reduces
E. coli growth and viability. Here, a photograph shows growth of E. coli on LB plates
containing AgNPs at (i) 0, (ii) 10, (iii) 20 and (iv) 50 lg cm3. (D) Numerous studies
have explored factors which inﬂuence AgNP lethality. This plot relates the number
of bacterial colonies able to grow on plates incubated with various amounts of
AgNPs, as a function of AgNP shape. Other factors which inﬂuence AgNP
antimicrobial efﬁciency include particle size, surface charge, and the nature of
substituents featured on the particles’ surfaces. Panels A and C are reproduced from

5 Miller indices, {nlm} refer to the symmetry of the crystal lattice along a given
mathematical plane. A plane with symmetry {1 1 1} has a different geometrical
arrangement of silver atoms than a plane with symmetry {1 0 0}, which can impact
surface reactivity and, apparently, binding to living cells.

materials [246]. This is especially true due to the controlled release
properties of AgNPs [247,248], which can be engineered to remain
potent antimicrobial agents for long periods of time. Thus, AgNP/
polymer nanocomposites are attractive materials for use in both
medical devices as well as food packaging materials to preserve
shelf life.
While silver zeolites have been used to create antibacterial
polymer composites for some time, AgNP-based nanocomposites
offer added stability and slower silver ion release rates into stored
foods, which is important for sustained antimicrobial activity. For
example, when the antimicrobial activity of an AgNP/SiO2 nano-
composite material was compared with that of a Ag zeolite and a
AgNO3/SiO2 composite, the latter two materials had more (10)
potent
acute
antimicrobial
responses
yet
the
nancomposite
allowed for a longer duration of activity [229]. Thus while a
zeolite-based material might offer a superior immediate effect,
the sustained antimicrobial activity of the nanocomposite would
be better suited for the packaging of foods that require long trans-
portation distances or storage times. Note that as in the case of
‘‘bare’’ AgNPs, the AgNP/SiO2 composite material was found to be
effective against a broad spectrum of bacteria and fungi, was more
effective against Gram-negative than Gram-positive bacteria, and
could be incorporated within a PP polymer matrix for the creation
of antibacterial ﬁlms for food contact applications.
Numerous AgNP/polymer PNCs have been reported in the liter-
ature. Sanchez-Valdes et al., for example, coated a ﬁve layer (PE/
tie/PA-6/tie/PE; PA-6 = polyamide six and tie = maleic anhydride
grafted polyethylene) plastic ﬁlm with an AgNP/polyethylene
nanocomposite layer and found antimicrobial activity against the
fungus A. niger, a common food contaminant [232]. Moreover, they
found (see Fig. 8, top) that the activity was dependant on the coat-
ing method: methods that gave rise to a rougher surface (and
hence more surface area for silver-ion release) had higher activity
than those that resulted in a smoother surface. Münstedt and
coworkers published several studies on AgNP/PA-6 and /PP PNCs
(AgNP particle size  800 nm) which possessed antimicrobial
activity against E. coli and S. aureus as well the fungus C. albicans,
polychaete worms (S. spirorbis), sea squirts (C. intestinalis) and al-
gae (U. intestinalis) [249–251]. The antimicrobial activity was also
found to be dependent on factors which affect silver ion release
rate, such as degree of polymer crystallinity [249], ﬁller type (i.e.,
silver particles, zeolites, etc.) [250], hydrophobicity of the matrix
[251] and particle size (i.e., nanocomposite vs. microcomposite)
[252]. Colloidal silver particles have also been coated 90–150 nm
thick onto paper using ultrasonic radiation, and this coated paper
was shown to manifest excellent antimicrobial activity against
E. coli and S. aureus, ‘‘suggesting its potential application as a food
packing material for longer shelf life’’ [253]. Other AgNP/polymer
PNCs
exhibiting
antimicrobial
activity
include
versions
in
poly(acrylamide) [254], PVA [255], PVP [256], PE [257], PMMA
[258], PU [259], PEO [260], alginate [261], soda-lime glass [262],
silicone elastomer [247], cellulose [263–265], and chitosan [266–
271]. The chitosan-based materials are particularly interesting, as
chitosan is a polysaccharide with natural antimicrobial properties,
which suggests a cumulative antimicrobial effect is attainable.
Moreover, chitosan ﬁlms loaded with AgNPs have also been found
to have better tensile and gas barrier properties than virgin ﬁlms
composed of the same material [268,270]. Layer-by-layer assembly
approaches have also been used to create antimicrobial Ag-based
PNCs [266,272] that have enhanced strength and mechanical
properties.
AgNP/polymer nanocomposite materials have been tested with
real food systems to determine the effect of AgNP antimicrobial
properties on food shelf-life. For instance, Mohammad-Fayaz
et al. dipped sterilized carrots and pears into alginate solutions
containing biosynthesized AgNPs, forming ‘‘edible antibacterial
ﬁlms’’. They found that the treated carrots and pears had less water
loss and higher consumer acceptability (judged on basis of color,
texture and taste) over the course of 10 days (Fig. 8, bottom)
[261]. In a similar study, fresh asparagus spears coated with
AgNP/polyvinylpyrrolidone nanocomposite ﬁlms had their shelf
lives extended to 25 days when stored at 2 C; in addition to hav-
ing less weight loss, greener color and tenderer texture, coated
asparagus also had less microorganism (psychotrophic bacteria,
yeast and mold) growth during this time period [256]. An edible
ﬁlm based on AgNPs dispersed in glycogen has also been reported
[273]. Chinese jujube fruit stored in food storage bags composed of
AgNP/nanoparticulate TiO2/polyethylene ﬁlms were ﬁrmer, hea-
vier, and had less decay, less browning and slower ripening over
a period of 12 days than fruit stored in control materials [257]. Or-
ange juice stored at 4 C in LDPE ﬁlms incorporating P105 (TiO2
and 10 nm nanosilver mixture) power at 5% loading exhibited sta-
tistically signiﬁcant reduction in Lactobacillus plantarum growth

over a time period of 112 days [274]. In another kind of application,
cellulose pads containing AgNPs generated from silver ions in situ
have been shown to reduce the microbial levels of exudates from
beef meat stored in modiﬁed atmosphere packaging [275], and
fresh cut melon stored on AgNP-containing cellulose pads had low-
er microbial counts (mesophiles, psychrophiles and yeasts) and
longer microbial growth lag times [265]. In addition, since silver
particles catalyze the destruction of ethylene gas, fruits stored in
the presence of AgNPs have slower ripening times and thus ex-
tended shelf lives [265].
Despite all of these advances in the use of silver nanostructures
for food packaging applications, comprehensive studies in various
polymer systems are still lacking, and much work needs to be done
to elucidate key relationships that inﬂuence the antimicrobial
strength of various AgNP-based PNC materials.
3.3. Other antimicrobial nanoparticles
The antimicrobial properties of nanoparticles composed of
other materials have been investigated. Titanium dioxide (TiO2)
particles in particular are promising [276–282]. Unlike AgNPs,
the antimicrobial activity of TiO2 nanoparticles is photocatalyzed
and thus TiO2-based antimicrobials are only active in the presence
of UV light. For instance, TiO2 nanoparticles have been found to be
effective against common food-borne pathogens including Salmo-
nella choleraesuis subsp., Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and L. monocytog-
enes under UV illumination but not in the dark [276]. Speciﬁcally
targeting food-packaging materials, Cerrada et al. ultrasonically
dispersed TiO2 nanoparticles throughout EVOH ﬁlms and observed
their effective photo-activated biocidal properties against nine
microorganisms (bacteria and yeasts) cited to be involved in food
poisoning and spoilage, some of the data for which are shown in
Fig. 9 [283]. Another food packaging study showed that polypro-
pylene ﬁlms coated with TiO2 nanoparticles inhibited E coli growth
on fresh cut lettuce [284]. Several researchers have combined the
antimicrobial properties of TiO2 nanoparticles with silver or AgNPs
to create ﬁlms or particles with enhanced antimicrobial activity
[257,285,286]. In principle, food packaging ﬁlms incorporating
TiO2 nanoparticles may have the additional beneﬁt of protecting
food content from the oxidizing effects of UV irradiation while
maintaining good optical clarity, as TiO2 nanoparticles are efﬁcient
short-wavelength light absorbers with high photostability; this ap-
proach to UV protection has already found traction in sunscreens
[287], textiles [288–290] and wood varnishes [291,292], although
care must be taken as some forms of nanoparticulate titania may
photocatalyze polymer oxidation and degradation.
Other nanoscale materials which have been shown to have anti-
microbial properties include nanoparticles based on magnesium
oxide [293–296], copper and copper oxide [219,297–305], zinc
oxide [274,306–316], cadmium selenide/telluride [317–319] and
chitosan [320–322], as well as carbon nanotubes [323,324]. Several
of these studies [300,308–310,313,316] are targeted speciﬁcally at
food or food packaging applications, and a recent publication re-
viewed the numerous classes of nanomaterial antimicrobials tar-
geted for use in drinking water sterilization [325]. In another
system, researchers replaced the sodium ions of montmorillonite
nanoclays with silver ions and showed antimicrobial activity of
these silver nanoclays when dispersed in poly(e-caprolactone)
[326]; nanoclays modiﬁed with silver have also been dispersed in
poly(lactic acid) to similar effect [327]. Note that complex nano-
scale architectures with antibacterial activity have also been devel-
oped; for example, Ho et al. covalently attached vancomycin
molecules to the surface of gold nanoparticles and showed that
they have killing power more potent than vancomycin on its
own, even against vancomycin-resistant bacterial strains [328],
and Yang et al. functionalized lysozyme-coated polystyrene nano-
particles with selective antibodies and demonstrated efﬁcient bac-
tericidicity against the common food pathogen L. monocytogenes
[329]. Finally, Bi et al. [330] loaded carbohydrate (phytoglycogen)
nanoparticles with nisin (a broad-spectrum antimicrobial peptide
produced by Lactococcus lactis during fermentation which is fre-
quently used during the manufacture of processed cheeses, meats
and beverages) and showed that they exhibit sustained antimicro-
bial activity against plated L. monocytogenes with efﬁcacy that lasts
several times longer than free nisin.
3.4. Health impacts of nanosilver-based biocidal materials
As with almost every other class of nanomaterial with commer-
cial applications, research and development of nanosilver has

outpaced our understanding of the potential consequences of the
use of this technology. Nanoscale silver particles are currently used
in more manufacturer identiﬁed products than any other nanoma-
terial [185]. There are (as of August 2009) at least 259 products
which utilize some form of nanosilver for their function [237],
ranging from textiles (socks and linens) to cosmetics/hygiene prod-
ucts (toothpastes, make-ups), from appliances (washing machines
and refrigerators) to cleaning agents (detergents, soaps), and from
kitchen supplies (food storage containers, bakeware, cutting
boards) to toys and building materials (paints, caulks, glues). Silver
nanoparticles may also make an appearance in commercialized
food packaging materials in the future. Unfortunately, the effect
of this increase in the use of nanoscale silver on human health
and the environment is unclear.
The number of AgNP in vivo toxicological studies is still incred-
ibly small, so generalized conclusions about the effects of AgNP
exposure via food-relevant routes of exposure remains limited. It
is, for example, still unclear to what extent the biochemical path-
ways which facilitate processing of silver ions apply to AgNPs, to
what extent AgNPs pass through the intestinal lining intact or
are dissolved into silver ions in the highly acidic environment of
the stomach, and to what extent AgNPs can pass through natural
biological barriers such as the blood–brain barrier, the placenta
or into breast milk. It is also crucial to note that regardless of one’s
interpretation of the available body of literature, there have been
almost no attempts to study the cumulative effects of chronic
AgNP exposure, and systematic investigations of the relationship
between particle characteristics (size, shape, surface charge, etc.)
and toxicity have yet to be performed. Furthermore, while one
study was able to demonstrate that silver nanoparticles dispersed
within electrospun PVA nanowhiskers were cytotoxic to epidermal
keratinocytes and ﬁbroblasts [331], very little is known about how
the toxicity of silver or AgNPs is altered when these species are dis-
persed within plastic coatings. A review of in vitro and in vivo AgNP
toxicological studies provides a more thorough analysis of this to-
pic [332].
In vitro toxicological studies have shown that AgNPs may not be
benign to isolated mammalian cells. Human lung ﬁbroblasts and
glioblastoma cells exposed to AgNPs exhibit reduced ATP content,
increased ROS production, damaged mitochondria, DNA damage
and chromosomal aberrations in a dose-dependent manner com-
pared to controls, suggesting that AgNPs have the potential to be
cytotoxic, genotoxic, antiproliferative and possibly carcinogenic
[333]. AgNPs at low concentrations in vitro cause changes to the
cell cycle progression of human hepatoma cells, whereas at higher
concentrations AgNPs induced abnormal cellular morphology, cell
shrinkage, and chromosomal damage to a much worse extent than
that caused by similar Ag+ concentrations, indicating that the tox-
icity of AgNPs is not only caused by Ag cation release [334]. Expo-
sure of spermatogonial mouse stem cells to 15 nm AgNPs at low
(10 lg/mL) levels in vitro results in cellular morphological changes
and mitochondrial damage, etc., and thus AgNPs may represent a
threat to male reproductive health under some conditions [335].
AgNPs also exhibit cytotoxicity to rat liver cells mediated through
oxidative stress (e.g., disrupted membrane potentials, ROS forma-
tion etc.) at far lower concentrations than particles composed of
other metals and metal oxides [336]; AgNP size-dependent cyto-
toxicity caused by oxidative stress and ROS formation was also
demonstrated for rat alveolar macrophages [337]. While at least
one AgNP-based dermatological ointment has been demonstrated
to be cytotoxic to human ﬁbroblasts and skin/carcinoma cells,
causing concentration-dependent morphological changes, signs of
oxidative stress, lipid oxidation, DNA fragmentation/apoptosis
and, at very high concentrations, necrosis, it has nevertheless been
concluded that AgNPs were safe for skin contact at concentrations
up to 6.25 lg/mL [338]; however this dosage may be expected to
be highly AgNP-size dependent, so the absolute usefulness of this
mass-based dosage metric is debatable, particularly since the AgNP
characteristics in this study were not disclosed. Despite these re-
ports of AgNP cytotoxicity, some other studies have arrived at con-
trary conclusions: one group of researchers found that epidermal
cells are unaffected by antimicrobial-relevant concentrations of
AgNPs [223] and several groups have determined that AgNPs con-
tained in LBL-assembled PNCs or bone-cements cause no observa-
ble toxic effects on human osteoblasts under the tested conditions
[266,272,339].
While there is a growing number of in vitro studies showing
that silver nanoparticles are cytotoxic to a variety of mammalian
cell types, in vivo studies which have investigated the systematic
effects of AgNP exposure by oral routes of exposure are more
ambiguous. For example, though AgNPs were found distributed
in virtually every organ of rats fed a steady nanoparticle diet, there
were few toxic effects observed except at the highest concentra-
tions [340,341]. An oral intake study in weaning pigs showed AgNP
accumulation in the liver but no acutely toxic effects [342]. On the
other hand, lymphocyte inﬁltration and inﬂammation has been ob-
served in the livers of mice which were fed nano- and micro-sized
silver particles, an effect which was exacerbated when particle
diameter was on the nanoscale [343].
It is important to keep in mind that in determining the health
impact of a new food contact substance, toxicity information needs
to be contextualized by a determination of how readily this sub-
stance can become released from packaging materials into various
foods substances. Unfortunately, very little work has been done to
assess the ability of nanoparticles in general, and AgNPs in partic-
ular, to migrate through rigid polymer environments and cross
over the packaging/food interface. Šimon et al. [172] used a phys-
icochemical approach to theorize that embedded AgNPs may dif-
fuse from food packaging into foods at detectable levels only
when the particle radius is very small (1 nm), when the packag-
ing is comprised of a polymer with relative low dynamic viscosity
(e.g., polyoleﬁns such as LDPE, HDPE and PP), and when there are
no signiﬁcant interactions between the particles and the polymer.
Though broad-scope experiments assessing this prediction have
not yet been published, at least one study [274] has shown evi-
dence of migration into a food substance, in this case orange juice,
from LDPE packaging materials incorporating Ag or ZnO antimicro-
bial nanoparticles6. A more pressing concern, however, may be food
contact materials in which the AgNPs are located on the material
surface, such that they come into direct contact with the food ma-
trix. In the aforementioned report of AgNPs being incorporated into
cellulose pads for use in modiﬁed atmosphere packaging of fresh
beef [275], for example, the authors found that detectable levels of
silver ions leeched into the meat exudates (though not into the meat
itself). Even so, systematic attempts to study relationships between
particle characteristics, polymer type, food pH/polarity, and, espe-
cially, environmental conditions relevant to food production, storage
and packaging use (e.g., temperature, pressure, humidity, light expo-
sure and storage time) are decidedly lacking, making it difﬁcult to
broadly assess this important aspect of the safety of AgNP-based
food contact materials at this time.
As a ﬁnal note, though the results of some AgNP toxicological
studies may appear ominous, they must be kept in perspective.
In many studies particles were poorly characterized or not charac-
terized at all, and the relationship between the effects of exposure
observed in isolated cells in vitro and those in whole organisms is
not always clear, particularly when questions remain about nano-
particle toxicology. Moreover, some studies go out of their way to
6 Only the presence of silver or zinc in the food matrix was reported, so it was not
known if whole nanoparticles, nanoparticle aggregates or only trace elements
migrated from the packaging material.

sound controversial or to overstate the relevance of their ﬁndings.
For example, one publication which has garnered some headlines
demonstrated that AgNPs interfere with DNA replication during
PCR cycles, as well as during reproduction in E. coli cells [344].
Yet the study’s title (‘‘Food storage material silver nanoparticles
interfere with DNA replication ﬁdelity and bind with DNA.’’) implies
that the article reports on a toxic effect in a consumer product,
when in fact the article has nothing to do with food or food pack-
aging at all. Thus scientists should make a heightened effort to
stick to the facts and avoid hyperbolic titles, conclusions or prog-
nostications wherever possible, so as to minimize the likelihood
of misleading news agencies or the public about the safety of con-
sumer products that contain nanomaterials.
4. Nanosensors and nanotechnology-based assays for food-
relevant analytes
Fresh produce or meats which are either spoiled or unpalatable
exhibit odors, colors or other sensory characteristics which can be
easily discerned by consumers. When packaging materials prevent
extensive sensory exposure, however, consumers must rely on
sell-by dates, which are determined by producers based on a set
of idealized assumptions about the way that the food is stored
or transported. While the sell-by date for a carton of milk may
indicate to a consumer that the product should be good for a period
of two weeks, this date may no longer be applicable if that milk
was stored above its optimal temperature for an hour, either in a
delivery truck or in a warm automobile.
The unique chemical and electro-optical properties of nanoscale
particles offer solutions to this problem. Through bottom-up engi-
neering, nanomaterials can be devised which are able to detect the
presence of gasses, aromas, chemical contaminants and pathogens,
or respond to changes in environmental conditions. This not only is
useful for quality control to ensure that consumers are able to pur-
chase products which are at their peak of freshness and ﬂavor, but
it also has the potential to improve food safety and reduce the fre-
quency of food-borne illnesses. Such technology would obviously
beneﬁt consumers, industry stakeholders and food regulators.
Some companies (e.g., Ripesense [http://www.ripesense.com] and
OnVu [http://www.onvu.com/]) already market nanotechnology
products that help consumers determine whether certain foods
are likely to be palatable, but most of the work on nanosensors
or assays for food-related analytes is still in the early stages of
development. This section highlights some of the most recent
and exciting work in this area.
4.1. Detection of small organic molecules
Beyond the beneﬁt afforded to supermarket shoppers and food
manufacturers, nanotechnology-based sensors have the potential
to revolutionize the speed and accuracy with which industries or
regulatory agencies can detect the presence of molecular contam-
inants or adulterants in complex food matrices. Many of these as-
says are based on observed color changes that occur to metal
nanoparticle solutions in the presence of analytes. For example,
gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) functionalized with cyanuric acid
groups selectively bind to melamine (Fig. 10), an adulterant used
to artiﬁcially inﬂate the measured protein content of pet foods
and infant formulas; the melamine-induced aggregation causes
AuNPs to undergo a reproducible, analyte-concentration-depen-
dent color change from red to blue, which can be used to precisely
measure the melamine content in raw milk and infant formula at
concentrations as low as 2.5 ppb with the naked eye [345]. A sim-
ilar approach examined test samples for the presence of melamine
by adding in sequential fashion separate solutions of gold ions and
a chemical reductant [346]. In this system, when melamine is pres-
ent in a sample, it binds to the reductant and prevents AuNP for-
mation; thus, test samples with no melamine turn fully red
during the assay due to AuNP formation via reaction between the
gold ions and the reductant. Colorimetric detection of melamine
in raw milk using AuNPs and crown-ether-modiﬁed thiols with a
limit of detection of 6 ppb has also been reported [347].
Other assay systems for small molecules depend on ﬂuores-
cence rather than absorptive color changes. For instance, a sensor
based on a detection methodology called enhanced ﬂuorescence
linked immuno-sorbent assay (EFLISA) can be used to detect the
presence of gliadin, one of the primary food proteins that cause
inﬂammation in patients suffering from Celiac disease [348]; this
system utilizes metal-enhanced ﬂuorescence from rhodamine-
labeled anti-gliadin antibodies in close proximity to nanostruc-
tured silver island ﬁlms (SIFs), an approach which could be used
to determine the gluten content of gluten-free foods and which
could be easily adapted for the selective detection of other
protein-based analytes. Another ﬂuorescence-based assay efﬁ-
ciently detected cyanide in drinking water at concentrations as
low as 2 nM using ﬂuorescence quenching of gold nanoclusters
[349], and a nanoscale liposome-based detector for the contami-
nation of drinking water with pesticides has also been devised
[350]. Several protein-based bacterial toxins [351], including
bolutinum toxin serotype A [352], have been detected at picomo-
lar (pM) levels using antibody-labeled luminescent quantum dots,
which would be useful in food safety and anti-bioterrorism
applications. Easy-to-read colorimetric metal nanoparticle detec-
tors have also been developed for numerous other small mole-
cules [353,354], proteins [355,356] and metal ions [357–362],

suggesting that similar strategies could be devised for the conve-
nient detection of a variety of common food adulterants, allergens
or contaminants.
Electrochemical detection is another popular method by which
nanomaterial-based sensors with applications in the food industry
function; compared to optical (colorimetric or ﬂuorimetric) meth-
ods, electrochemical approaches may be more useful for food
matrices because the problem of light scattering and absorption
from the various food components can be avoided. Many electro-
chemical sensors operate by binding selective antibodies to a con-
ductive nanomaterial (e.g., carbon nanotube) and then monitoring
changes to the material’s conductivity when the target analyte
binds to the antibodies. For example, conduction changes which
occur when Microcystin-LR (MCLR), a toxin produced by cyanobac-
teria, binds to the surface of anti-MCLR-coated single-walled
carbon nanotubes are easily detectable down to MCLR concentra-
tions of 0.6 nM, which easily satisﬁes guidelines set by the
World Health Organization for this substance in drinking water
[363]; this technique improves the sampling time over traditional
MCLR measurement methods (e.g., ELISA) by an order of magni-
tude. A similar strategy utilizing AuNPs and glucose-sensitive
enzymes can be used to measure glucose concentrations in
commercial beverages [364], and a reusable piezoelectric AuNP
immunosensor has been developed which detects the presence of
aﬂatoxin-B17 in contaminated milk samples down to a concentra-
tion of 0.01 ng/mL [365]. Other electrochemical systems based on
nanomaterials include: an immunosensor based on a cerium oxide
nanoparticle and chitosan nanocomposite which detects ochra-
toxin-A, a food-borne fungal contaminant [366]; detection of staph-
ylococcal enterotoxin B [367] and cholera-toxin [368] using silicon
nanowire transistors and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), respectively;
and detection and quantiﬁcation of food colorants8 (Ponceau 4R
and Allura Red in soft drinks [369] and Sudan 1 in ketchup or chili
powder [370]) using CNTs and the concentration dependent inten-
sity changes of the colorant-speciﬁc oxidation peaks. Note that ana-
lytes are not limited to harmful substances: one study showed that
CNT-based electrochemical detection in microﬂuidic devices can be
used to measure antioxidant, ﬂavor compound and vitamin content
in vanilla beans and apples [371]. Numerous other examples of elec-
trochemical detection of various biomolecules using nanomaterials
are provided in a recent review of the topic [372].
4.2. Detection of gasses
Excess moisture and oxygen are leading causes of food spoilage,
and yet many assays for vapor or gas content inside of a package
require destruction of the package [373–375]. Thus, in processing
facilities, packaged foods are tested randomly during a production
run, typically one in every 300–400 packages [375], which is
time-consuming and costly, yet does not ensure that unsampled
packages meet quality and safety standards [376]. The ability
to continually and easily monitor the gas content of a package
headspace would also provide a means to assess the safety and
quality of the contained food long after it has left the production
facility, suggesting that noninvasive leak detection and gas content
methods would be invaluable [374].
To this end, numerous noninvasive gas sensing methods based
on nanotechnology have been devised. Mills and coworkers,
for example, have developed a promising photoactivated indica-
tor ink for in-package oxygen detection based upon nanosized
TiO2 or SnO2 particles and a redox-active dye (methylene blue)
[375,377–380]; this detector gradually changes color in response
to even minute quantities of oxygen, as shown in Fig. 11. While
quantiﬁcation of the oxygen content within food packages would
be difﬁcult with this technology, it nevertheless would provide
consumers and retailers an easy, visual method to identify
modiﬁed atmosphere packages (MAPs) with possible compromised
seal integrity. One example of a sensor for moisture content,
shown in Fig. 12, is based upon carbon-coated copper nanoparti-
cles dispersed in a tenside ﬁlm [376]. In humid environments,
swelling of the polymer matrix results in larger degrees of inter-
nanoparticle separation; these changes cause sensor strips to
reﬂect or absorb different colors of light which can be monitored
easily for quick and accurate determination of package moisture
levels without invasive sampling. A noninvasive method of
measuring
carbon
dioxide
content
in
MAPs
has
also
been
devised, and is based upon lifetime analysis of luminescent dyes
standardized by ﬂuorophore-encapsulated polymer nanobeads
[381]; notably, this CO2 sensor has a detection range of 0.8–100%,
a resolution of 1%, and only 0.6% cross-sensitivity with molecular
oxygen.
Some other examples of gas sensing related to food safety or
quality include: detection of gaseous amines, which are indicators
of ﬁsh and meat spoilage [382], at the parts-per-trillion (ppt) level
(theoretical) effected using ﬂuorescence quenching of nanoﬁbrils
of perylene-based ﬂuorophores [383,384] or at the ppm level using
conductance changes in composites of SnO2 nanoparticles and TiO2
microrods [385]; a series of electronic sensors which utilize ZnO–
TiO2 nanocomposites or SnO ‘‘nanobelts’’ to detect the presence
of volatile organics, including acetone, ethanol and carbon monox-
ide [386–388]; and WO3-SnO2 nanocomposites to detect the pres-
ence of ethylene gas, a hormone responsible for fruit ripening
[389].
Fig. 11. Photographs of O2 sensors which utilize UV-activated TiO2 nanoparticles
and methylene blue indicator dye, one placed inside of a food package ﬂushed
with CO2 and one placed outside. In (a) the package is freshly sealed and both
indicators are blue. The photograph in (b) shows the indicators immediately after
activation with UVA light. After a few minutes, the indicator outside of the
package returns to a blue color, whereas the indicator in an oxygen-free
atmosphere remains white (c) until the package is opened, in which case the
inﬂux of oxygen causes it to change back to blue (d). This system could be used
to easily and noninvasively detect the presence of leaks in every package
immediately after production and at retail sites. Images taken from [375]

7 Aﬂatoxin-B1 is a toxic and carnicogenic substance found in grains and other food
crops contaminated by fungi in the genus Aspergillus, as well as in milk produced by
animals that eat contaminated feed.
8 Detection of food colorants would be especially useful because numerous
colorant additives, including Ponceau R4 and Sudan 1, have been shown to be
carcinogenic in either animals or humans and often show up illegally as adulterants in
many imported food products.

4.3. Detection of microorganisms
In 2011, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimated that
food-borne pathogens cause approximately 48 million illnesses
in the US each year, 128,000 of which lead to hospitalization and
3000 of which result in death [390–392]. The CDC further esti-
mates that reducing foodborne illness by just 1% would keep about
500,000 Americans from getting sick each year.9 Thus the ability to
determine whether food products are contaminated by various bac-
teria, fungi or viruses that can cause food-borne illnesses remains an
important research objective. Detection methods which are fast,
inexpensive and require little expertise or training to correctly inter-
pret are especially desirable for ‘‘point of care’’ (i.e., non-laboratory)
settings.
Most convenient biological detection methods are based on
immunological assays which take advantage of selective anti-
body-antigen interactions. Nanomaterial-based microbial sensors
generally utilize the same strategy, but because they possess un-
ique optical and electrical properties in combination with spacious,
easily functionalized surfaces, nanomaterials offer signiﬁcant
improvements in selectivity, speed and sensitivity compared to
chemical or biological methods based on macroscale materials.
Several authors have reviewed the advantages of nanomaterial-
based pathogen sensing in detail [393–395].
As mentioned earlier, a signiﬁcant problem with sensing in
complex matrices such as foods is dealing with sample opacity,
light scattering, color and other numerous interferences. Though
some all-optical methods have been devised, such as one which
used two-photon Rayleigh scattering in conjunction with anti-
body-conjugated gold nanoparticles to selectively detect E. coli
[396], most detection strategies in real food systems require isola-
tion of the target organism from the surrounding environment to
ensure that signal-to-noise ratios are sufﬁciently large to observe.
Often, a technique known as immunomagnetic separation (IMS) is
used to satisfy this requirement (e.g., [397]). IMS uses magnetic
particles attached to selective antibodies in combination with a
magnet to selectively separate the target analyte from the food
matrix prior to detection. Nanoscale magnetic particles are espe-
cially useful in this regard due to their extremely high surface-
to-volume ratios, which facilitate large analyte capture efﬁciencies.
Captured analytes can then be easily puriﬁed and subjected to
standard measurement techniques. This approach is illustrated
graphically in Fig. 13. For instance, attachment of antibodies selec-
tive for L. monocytogenes onto functionalized, magnetic iron oxide
nanoparticles can be used to efﬁciently separate the target bacteria
from artiﬁcially contaminated milk and detect them using real-
time PCR analysis [398]. A similar approach has been used to iso-
late E. coli from freshly ground beef with >94% capture efﬁciency
and no interference from other tested bacterial species [399].
Due to the unique electrical and optical properties of nanoma-
terials, and the ease with which bottom-up engineering can pro-
vide multifunctional nanoscale architectures, pathogen detection
strategies are increasingly abandoning conventional microbiologi-
cal analysis methods in preference of a reliance on nanomaterials
themselves as the means of detection. The general idea is that
not only can the nanoscale magnetic particles be used to bind
and isolate analytes from the matrix, but they (or other nanomate-
rials which constitute parts of multi-component systems) can also
be directly detected without the need for time-consuming biolog-
ical assays. This is particularly easy with microbial detection be-
cause the small size of nanoparticles relative to those of the
target organisms causes large, readily observable electrical/optical
property modulations before and after binding events. It is also
worth pointing out that nanomaterials lend themselves well to
multiplexing assays, as in the case of a barcode-style method
Fig. 12. Moisture sensor which utilizes carbon-coated copper nanoparticles
dispersed in a polymer matrix (a). Ethanol vapor exposure results in rapid and
reversible iridescent coloration (b). Water vapor exposure swells the polymer,
which causes the nanoparticles to exhibit larger interparticle separation distances
and thus different observable optical behavior (c). As moisture dissipates (d–f), the
sensor reverts back to its native state and appearance. Reprinted with permission

Fig. 13. Schematic illustrating IMS-based detection methods using magnetic
nanoparticles. (a) Antibodies selective for speciﬁc bacterial strains or species (e.g.,
E. coli) are bound to the surfaces of magnetic nanoparticles (e.g., Fe2O3). Only the
targeted organisms will bind to the functionalized magnetic nanoparticles. (b) A
complex matrix (e.g., food, blood, milk, etc.) contains the target analyte as well as
numerous potential interferences, such as other bacterial species, viruses, proteins,
food or blood particles, etc. Functionalized magnetic nanoparticles are added to the
matrix, where they bind selectively and with high capture efﬁciency to the target
analyte. A magnetic ﬁeld isolates the analyte-bound magnetic particles, after which
the supernatant is then carefully decanted. The remaining material is then
subjected to quantiﬁcation assays. In more sophisticated systems, the magnetic
nanoparticles themselves are the means of detection and quantiﬁcation (see text).

which utilizes binding of selective antibodies to speciﬁc regions of
magnetic (and nonmagnetic) multi-metal nanowires for the simul-
taneous, multiplexed optical detection of bacteria, viruses and pro-
tein-based toxins [400].
There are numerous examples which demonstrate the utility of
nanomaterials, and in particular magnetic nanomaterials, as vehi-
cles for the simultaneous isolation and optical or magnetic detec-
tion of microorganisms. Magnetic nanoparticles can be used to
isolate Mycobacterium avium spp. paratuberculosis from contami-
nated whole milk and determine the bacterial concentration by
observing
effects
of
conjugation-induced
magnetic
particle
agglomeration on the spin–spin (T2) relaxation times of nearby
water protons [401]; importantly, this method is not susceptible
to interference from other bacterial species that may be present
in the matrix. A similar approach that measures changes in the
magnetic susceptibility (correlated to changes in particle hydrody-
namic volume) of bound and unbound iron oxide particles efﬁ-
ciently detects Brucella antibodies in the blood serum of infected
cows [402].
One of the most signiﬁcant advantages of highly-sensitive
nanotechnology-based techniques is the reduced incubation and
measurement times required for accurate detection. For instance,
one research group used sugar molecules attached to nanosized
magnetic iron oxide particles to isolate up to 88% of E. coli in a sam-
ple with only a 45 min incubation time [403]; the E. coli were sub-
sequently detected using ﬂuorescent staining. Irudayaraj and
coworkers improved upon this approach by using species- and
strain-speciﬁc antibodies instead of sugar molecules to isolate
and optically detect (bench top FTIR/ portable mid-IR) the target
organisms in 2% milk and spinach extract [404]. In a separate series
of studies, they used magnetic nanoparticles in conjunction with
gold nanorods (AuNRs) to separate and detect key food-borne bac-
teria; here, the magnetic particles facilitate separation while the
AuNRs are used for optical detection in the near-infrared. Notably,
because AuNRs have length-dependant absorptive properties and
efﬁcient light-to-heat energy conversion, they offer the possibility
of multiplexed detection (i.e., simultaneous detection of multiple
organisms) as well as efﬁcient photoactivated antimicrobial activ-
ity via thermal ablation, all from a single multi-component entity
[405,406]. Optical colorimetric detection and thermal ablation of
Salmonella using oval-shaped AuNPs has also been demonstrated
[407]. With this in mind, is also worth pointing out that nanoma-
terials can be useful for the rapid detection of microorganisms after
IMS, even IMS performed using conventionally-sized magnetic par-
ticles: as an example, Su and Li used IMS to separate E. coli from
test samples and semiconductor nanocrystals (quantum dots) as
ﬂuorescent tags [408]. Their protocol offered a detection range of
103–107 CFU/mL and total detection time of only 2 h, compared
with 18–24 h for traditional bacterial plating/incubation methods.
As with chemical analytes, electrochemical detection of micro-
organisms is also a popular and efﬁcient method when it comes to
nanomaterials. A particularly nice example of this strategy is pro-
vided by Wang et al., who fabricated conductive TiO2 nanowire
bundles, coated them with antibodies selective for L. monocytoge-
nes, and deposited them between two gold electrodes, as shown
in Fig. 14 [409]. In contaminated samples, bacteria bind to the anti-
bodies, which causes a measurable change in impedance across the
nanowire bundle. Using this technique, the authors were able to
detect as low as 4.7  102 CFU/mL L. monocytogenes in 1 h without
signiﬁcant interference from other food-borne pathogens; this is a
signiﬁcant improvement over traditional Immuno-Dot Blot analy-
sis, which had a detection limit of 2.2  105 CFU/mL. Changes in
conductance or resistance across circuits manufactured from or
including nanoscale components have also been used to detect
members of the Bacillus [410], Salmonella [411,412], and Echerichia
[413,414] bacterial genera, as well as viruses [412].
Fig. 14. Impedance-based detection of bacteria. (a) Gold electrodes protected with n-butylthiol ligands are connected with a conductive TiO2 nanowire bundle. Antibodies
selective to the target bacterium are then bound to the nanowire bundle. When the sensor is exposed to a complex matrix containing the target organism, changes in the
electrical (impedance) properties of the bundle due to bacterium-antibody binding events can be readily observed. (b) and (c) Sample data set illustrating the detection of
Listeria monocytogenes at a concentration of 4.65  103 cfu/ml. Note that exposure to a control medium (b) causes no changes to the impedance across the bundle, but that

4.4. Detection by surface-enhanced raman scattering (SERS)
Like infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy is a particularly
valuable tool for the identiﬁcation and detection or organic com-
pounds because each molecule has a unique pattern of molecular
vibrations which gives rise to a correspondingly unique spectral
ﬁngerprint. Though Raman spectroscopy has numerous advantages
over infrared for molecular identiﬁcation, a signiﬁcant disadvan-
tage is that Raman scattering is an extremely weak effect, which
limits its usefulness in diagnostic applications. However, it was
discovered in the 1970s that roughened metal surfaces can greatly
(typically in the range of 4–7 orders of magnitude) increase the Ra-
man peak intensity of analyte molecules in their general proximity.
Though the physical origin of surface-enhanced Raman scattering
(SERS) is still a matter of some scientiﬁc debate, it is known that
the effect is at least partially caused by interaction of molecular
electronic states with localized electric ﬁelds generated by photo-
excitation of metal surface plasmons. Because of orientation
requirements between the molecular transitions and the plasmon
oscillations, SERS enhancement is greatest on surfaces with large
degrees of curvature or ‘‘roughness’’. As a result, nanoscale metal
structures, such as those comprised of gold or silver, give rise to
the most enhanced, and thus practically useful, SERS signals for
characterization and detection of analytes.
SERS using nanoscale substrates has proven to be a useful
platform for the detection of food-related analytes. For instance,
Mengshi Lin and coworkers have pioneered the use of fractal-like
or patterned gold nanostructures (Fig. 15) as substrates to detect
compounds of interest to food safety, including melamine and
its derivatives [415–417], as well as crystal violet and malachite
green (0.2 ppb level) [418], which are two FDA-banned fungi-
cides/antimicrobials often found in ﬁsh grown in contaminated
waters. With respect to melamine, the authors were able to
identify this compound extracted from milk with concentrations
as low as 2 ppm [417], and also from artiﬁcially contaminated
wheat gluten, chicken feed, cakes and noodles [416]. Such a
SERS-based detection method might be useful for quick screening
of food samples, followed by conventional HPLC analysis for the
elimination of false positives. Gold nanoparticles may be used as
well for SERS detection of perchlorate (an environmental food
and water pollutant) at the nM level in contaminated water
samples [419].
In addition to chemical contaminants, SERS can also be used to
detect and identify food-borne pathogens, as each bacterial species
appears to have a unique ﬁngerprint arrangement of spectral
peaks. For instance, single Bacillus spores can be detected using
SERS and nanostructured gold substrates, and several different
Bacillus species can be easily distinguished [420]. Silver substrates
can be used to rapidly and simultaneously screen for E. coli, L. mon-
ocytogenes, and S. typhimurium [421] and gold substrates have been
used to identify and discriminate seven food- and water-borne
viruses in drinking water, including norovirus, adenovirus, parvo-
virus, simian rotovirus, coronavirus, Sendai virus and herpes virus,
with clear spectral differences even at the strain level and detec-
tion limits of 100 particles [422]. In a more recent report, AuNPs,
AgNPs and Au–Ag core–shell nanoparticles were used in conjunc-
tion with unique Raman reporter molecules for simultaneous
detection of multiple organisms via a combination of SERS and
UV–Vis spectroscopy [423]; the same research group has also used
a combination of magnetic separation with labeled silica-coated
magnetic nanoparticles and AuNPs labeled with Raman reporter
molecules for multiplexed SERS detection of S. enterica serovar
Typhimurium and S. aureus in spinach wash and peanut butter
emulsion with a detection limit of 103 CFUs/mL [424].
In summary, while the use of SERS and nanoscale materials as a
tool to detect the presence of contaminants or pathogens related to
food safety is still in its infancy, the early results are very promising
in terms of both detection limits and speed of measurement.
5. Outlook
Nanotechnology will likely impact virtually every aspect of
the food sector in some way. This review has discussed in some
detail a few of the most promising applications, including food
packaging materials that possess extremely high gas barriers
and antimicrobial properties, and nanosensors which can detect
microorganisms or chemical contaminants at surprisingly low
levels. Other prospective uses for nanotechnology in foods which
were not discussed include, but are not limited to: nanoencaps-
ulants for the delivery of nutrients, ﬂavors, or aromas [425];
more potent pesticides [426]10; security inks or nanobarcodes
to protect against counterfeiting or preserve product identity
[427,428]; and nanoparticles which can be utilized in targeted
genetic engineering of agriculturally-relevant livestock or plant
organisms [428].

SERS substrate is effectively 4  107 times larger than that of the conven-
tional
Raman
experiment.

contaminents,

Despite these potential beneﬁts, the future of ‘‘nanofoods’’ re-
mains uncertain. It is well known that consumers are much
more hesitant to accept new technologies in their foods than
in other consumer products, and nanotechnology is no exception.
While the public currently views generalized nanotechnology
applications in a relatively neutral or even positive way, some
research suggests that they remain wary about nanotechnology
as it is applied in the context of foods. In addition to dreading
the health and environmental consequences of nanofoods con-
sumption, consumers are also concerned about ethical or moral
issues, including labeling and the right to choose, improvement
of human abilities, engineering of living matter, privacy, equita-
bility of socioeconomic distribution and naturalness of the food
supply.
As a result of these considerations, public acceptance of food
products which incorporate or utilize nanomaterials will be pred-
icated largely on how much trust the public has in industry and
the government to protect them from unknown hazards [11]. To
that end, openness on industry’s part regarding what they’re doing
and why they’re doing it will go a long way toward assuaging pub-
lic fears about nano-food products. Unfortunately, an editorial arti-
cle published in the journal Nature Nanotechnology recently
asserted that ‘‘up to 400 companies around the world are research-
ing possible applications of nanotechnology in food and food pack-
aging – and many of them do not want their customers to know
this’’ [429]. Even more foreboding: in a highly publicized report
published in 2010 [430], the United Kingdom House of Lords’ Sci-
ence and Technology Committee stated that ‘‘far from being trans-
parent about its activities, the food industry was refusing to talk
about its work in [nanotechnology]. . . This is exactly the type of
behavior which may bring about the public reaction which [indus-
try] is trying to avert.’’
The future of nanofoods is also contingent upon the way this
emerging technology is handled by regulatory agencies. The
enormous potential beneﬁts offered by nanotechnology must be
weighed against the potential risks of use and abuse of nanoma-
terials – and in large part these risks are still being evaluated.
When it comes to foods and food packaging materials incorporat-
ing nanoscale materials, there are numerous data gaps that need
to be ﬁlled in order to demonstrate product safety to a wary
public. These data gaps include a lack of information regarding:
nanomaterial migration through polymer ﬁlms; the interaction
of nanomaterial biomolecules and cellular components; the value
of mass-based deﬁnitions of dosage in the context of nanomate-
rials; the interrelationships between nanoparticle characteristics
(size, shape, surface charge, etc.) and toxicity or pharmacokinetic
properties;
appropriate
and
consistent
methods
to
identify,
characterize
and
quantify
nanomaterials
in
complex
food
matrices; chronic toxicity of nanomaterials or toxicity following
oral routes of exposure; and biodegradability of nanomaterials
or
the
toxicity
of
nanomaterials
to
ecologically
important
organisms.
The goal of this article was to show the reader that nanoma-
terials offer some exciting beneﬁts to the food industry, includ-
ing better materials for food packaging and also safer foods on
supermarket shelves that have lower incidences of contamina-
tion with chemical adulterants and potentially life-threatening
microorganisms. The applications reviewed here were speciﬁ-
cally chosen because they are the most likely nanofood products
to be accepted by consumers in the short-term. Even so, food
nanotechnology is still young, and the future of this exciting
ﬁeld is still largely uncertain. Regardless of how applications of
nanotechnology in the food sector are ultimately marketed, gov-
erned, or perceived by the public, it seems clear that the manip-
ulation of matter on the nanoscale will continue to yield exciting
and unforeseen products. We must continue to be stalwart
against the potential dangers and ethical questions that the
use of this new technology will pose, and successful and safe
implementation of these applications will require constant dia-
logue between the scientists and companies who invent them
and the consumers who purchase them. If we succeed in these
endeavors, then the beneﬁts of nanotechnology may play an
important role in making the world’s food supply healthier,
safer, and more plentiful.
