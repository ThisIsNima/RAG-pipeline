Introduction
Throughout the ages humans have relied on nature for their
basic needs for the production of foodstuffs, shelters, clothing,
means of transportation, fertilizers, flavors and fragrances, and,
not least, medicines. Plants have formed the basis of sophisti-
cated traditional medicine systems that have been in existence
for thousands of years.1 The first records, written on hundreds
of clay tablets in cuneiform, are from Mesopotamia and date
from about 2600 BC; amongst the approximately 1000 plant
derived substances which they used were oils of Cedrus species
(cedar) and Cupressus sempevirens (cypress), Glycyrrhiza
glabra (licorice), Commiphora species (myrrh), and Papaver
somniferum (poppy juice), all of which are still in use today for
the treatment of ailments ranging from coughs and colds to
parasitic infections and inflammation.
Egyptian medicine dates from about 2900 BC, but the best
known Egyptian pharmaceutical record is the “Ebers Papyrus”
dating from 1500 BC; this documents over 700 drugs (mostly
plants, though animal organs were included together with some
minerals), and includes formulae such as gargles, snuffs,
poultices, infusions, pills and ointments, with beer, milk, wine
and honey being commonly used as vehicles.
The Chinese Materia Medica has been extensively docu-
mented over the centuries, with the first record dating from
about 1100 BC (Wu Shi Er Bing Fang, containing 52
prescriptions), followed by works such as the Shennong Herbal
( ~ 100 BC; 365 drugs) and the Tang Herbal (659 AD; 850 drugs).
Likewise, documentation of the Indian Ayurvedic system dates
from about 1000 BC (Charaka; Sushruta and Samhitas with 341
and 516 drugs respectively), and this system formed the basis
for the primary text of Tibetan medicine, Gyu-zhi (Four
Tantras) translated from Sanskrit during the eighth century
AD.2,3
In the ancient Western world, the Greeks contributed
substantially to the rational development of the use of herbal
drugs. The philosopher and natural scientist, Theophrastus
( ~ 300 BC), in his ‘History of Plants’, dealt with the medicinal
qualities of herbs, and noted the ability to change their
characteristics through cultivation. Dioscorides, a Greek physi-
cian (100 AD), during his travels with Roman armies throughout
the then ‘known world’, accurately recorded the collection,
storage, and use of medicinal herbs, and is considered by many
to be the most important representative of the science of herbal
drugs in ‘ancient times’. Galen (130–200 AD), who practiced
and taught pharmacy and medicine in Rome, and published no
less than 30 books on these subjects, is well known for his
complex prescriptions and formulae used in compounding
drugs. These were based on the Hippocratic theory that all
illnesses were based on an imbalance of four primary ‘humours’
and were extremely complex at times containing dozens of
ingredients (the so-called ‘galenicals’).
During the Dark and Middle Ages, from the fifth to the
twelfth centuries, the monasteries in countries such as England,
Ireland, France and Germany preserved the remnants of this
Western knowledge. However, it was the Arabs who were

responsible for the preservation of much of the Greco-Roman
expertise, and for expanding it to include the use of their own
resources, together with Chinese and Indian herbs unknown to
the Greco-Roman world. The Arabs were the first to establish
privately owned drug stores in the eighth century, and the
Persian pharmacist, physician, philosopher and poet Avicenna
contributed much to the sciences of pharmacy and medicine
through works, such as Canon Medicinae, regarded as ‘the final
codification of all Greco-Roman medicine’. This was subse-
quently superceded by the comprehensive compilation known
as the Corpus of Simples by Ibn al-Baitar who practiced in
Malaga during the Moorish occupation of Spain. This document
combined the data of Dioscorides with works from the Middle
and Far East.
These, and many other works, were formally codified at least
in the UK by the publication in 1618 of the London
Pharmacopoeia and the idea of ‘pure’ compounds as drugs may
be traced to the isolation of the active principles of commonly
used plants and herbs such as strychnine, morphine, atropine
and colchicine in the early 1800s. These isolations were then
followed by what can be considered the first commercial pure
natural product, morphine, by E. Merck in 1826 and the first
semi-synthetic pure drug based on a natural product, aspirin, by
Bayer in 1899.4
David Newman was born in Grays, Essex, UK. His initial
training was as an analyst (GRIC) followed by an MSc in
Organic Chemistry (University of Liverpool) and then after
some time in the UK chemical industry, a DPhil in Microbial
Chemistry from the University of Sussex in 1968. Following two
years of postdoctoral studies on the structure of electron
transport proteins at the University of Georgia, USA, he worked
with Smith Kline and French in Philadelphia, PA, as a
biological chemist predominantly in the area of antibiotic
discovery. During this time period, he obtained an MLS in
Information Sciences in 1977 from Drexel University, Phil-
adelphia, PA. Following the discontinuance of antibiotic
discovery programs at SKF, he worked for a number of US-
based pharmaceutical companies in natural-products based
discovery programs in anti-infectives and cancer treatments,
and joined the Natural Products Branch of the NCI in 1991. He
is responsible for the marine and microbial collection programs
of the NCI and in concert with Gordon Cragg, for the NCI’s
Open and Active Repository programs. His scientific interests
are in the discovery and history of novel natural products as
drug leads in the anti-infective and cancer areas, in novel
delivery methods for such agents and in the application of
information technologies to drug discovery. In conjunction with
Gordon Cragg, he has established collaborations between the
National Cancer Institute and organizations in many countries
promoting drug discovery from their natural resources. He has
published over 50 papers and patents that are related to these
interests and is both an UK Chartered Chemist and an UK
Chartered Biologist.
Gordon Cragg was born in Cape Town, South Africa, and
obtained his undergraduate training in Chemistry at Rhodes
University before proceeding to Oxford University where he
obtained his DPhil in Organic Chemistry in 1963. After two
years of postdoctoral research in natural products chemistry at
the University of California, Los Angeles, he returned to South
Africa to join the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research.
In 1966, he was appointed to the staff of the Department of
Chemistry at the University of South Africa, and transferred to
the University of Cape Town in 1972. In 1979, he returned to the
United States to join the Cancer Research Institute at Arizona
State University, working with Professor G. Robert Pettit on the
isolation of potential anticancer agents from plant and marine
invertebrate sources. In 1985, he moved to the National Cancer
Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, and was appointed Chief of the
Natural Products Branch in 1989. His major interests lie in the
discovery of novel natural product agents for the treatment of
cancer and AIDS. In 1991 he was awarded the National
Institutes of Health Merit Award for his contributions to the
development of the drug, Taxol®, and in 1998 he was elected
President of the American Society of Pharmacognosy. He has
established collaborations between the National Cancer In-
stitute and organizations in many countries promoting drug
discovery from their natural resources. He has published over
100 papers related to these interests.
Kenneth Snader was born in Harrisburg, PA, USA. He obtained
his undergraduate training at the Philadelphia College of
Pharmacy and Science and after some years in the pharmaceu-
tical industry returned to obtain his PhD in Organic Chemistry
from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as a Walter G.
Karr Fellow. He went directly to Smith Kline and French
Laboratories where, after a brief period in the study of anti-
inflammatory compounds he returned to natural products to
oversee the antibiotics discovery chemistry group. Following
the discontinuance of the antibiotic discovery program at SKF,
he briefly supervised the marine natural products chemistry
group at SeaPharm before he joined the Natural Products
Branch of the National Cancer Institute in 1987. After a
significant effort at producing enough of the drug Taxol® to
complete the clinical trials of that natural product, for which he
was awarded the National Institutes of Health Merit Award, he
moved from the Natural Products Branch to the Pharmaceutical
Resources Branch of the NCI, taking on his current responsibil-
ities for production of GMP bulk drugs for NCI clinical trials.
His scientific interests are in the discovery, identification, and
large scale production of natu-
ral products for medicinal use
and together with Gordon
Cragg and members of the Nat-
ural Products Branch has pro
moted and encouraged the dis-
covery of new chemotherapeu-
tic agents from natural sources.
He has published over 50 pa-
pers and patents related to
these interests.

General role of traditional medicine in drug discovery
As mentioned above, plants have formed the basis for
traditional medicine systems which have been used for
thousands of years in countries such as China5 and India.2,6 The
use of plants in the traditional medicine systems of many other
cultures has been extensively documented.7 These plant-based
systems continue to play an essential role in health care, and it
has been estimated by the World Health Organization that
approximately 80% of the world’s inhabitants rely mainly on
traditional medicines for their primary health care.8,9
Plant products also play an important role in the health care
systems of the remaining 20% of the population, mainly
residing in developed countries. Analysis of data on prescrip-
tions dispensed from community pharmacies in the United
States from 1959 to 1980 indicated that about 25% contained
plant extracts or active principles derived from higher plants.
Currently, at least 119 chemical substances, derived from 90
plant species, can be considered as important drugs that are in
use in one or more countries.8 Of these 119 drugs, 74% were
discovered as a result of chemical studies directed at the
isolation of the active substances from plants used in traditional
medicine.
A more recent study using US-based prescription data from
1993, demonstrated that natural products still play a major role
in drug treatment, as over 50% of the most-prescribed drugs in
the US had a natural product either as the drug, or as a ‘forebear’
in the synthesis or design of the agent.10

Role of natural products in treatment of diseases
This review will cover the following general areas of disease:
microbial and some parasitic areas; neoplastic; cardiovascular
and hypertension; pain/CNS and will be discussed from the
aspect of the disease rather than the more customary division by
source of organism. This approach was chosen because of the
cross-over that is now being seen where agents originally
isolated and purified as a result of their ability to inhibit one type
of screen are now being utilized in other entirely different areas.
The review will finish with a short section on ‘Future
Trends’.
Perhaps the best example of this cross-over is the work over
the last 30 or so years on the microbial product, rapamycin.
Originally isolated as an antifungal agent, it has just been
approved as an immunosuppressive drug and is also being
tested (as a derivative) as an anti-neoplastic agent. Thus the use
of a disease area permits agents from all sources to be discussed
in a group.
For earlier coverage of the role of natural products in drug
discovery, the excellent 1995 review by Cordell should be
consulted.11

Antiinfective agents (including antimalarials)
We have not attempted to make the following discussion
comprehensive in its coverage of the various anti-infective
classes. The guiding principle has been to show areas where the
natural product has led to ‘improved materials by semi-
synthetic modifications of a base molecule that a medicinal
chemist would not even dream of making’. Thus the glycopep-
tides such as vancomycin, or the simple but very effective agent,
chloramphenicol, are not further considered.
Although there were anecdotal stories of the use of poultices
of rotten bread on puncture or slash wounds from the Roman
wars, and from Arab medicinal treatments used during the many
conflicts that the Western ‘navigators’ had with the Arabs from
the fifteenth century onwards, no systematic method of
treatment appeared in the literature for suppurating wounds
caused by bacterial infections until Lister used P. glaucum for
“curing” a large non-healing abscess in 1884 (cf. p. 124 in
Mann12).
4.1
Antibacterials: b-lactams
The ‘Golden Age of Antibiotics’, as the time period from the
1940s to the 1970s has been christened, can be considered to
have its beginning in the serendipitous discovery of penicillin
by Fleming in 1928, reported in the British Medical Literature
in 1929. The history of the discovery of penicillin has been told
and retold and we do not intend to go over this story in detail
again. An excellent reprint has just been issued of the ‘History
of Penicillin Production’13 and that publication goes into the
story in detail from the aspect of large scale production of
penicillin G (1) and penicillin V (2). It is rather ironic that the
major impetus to the development and production of the initial
b-lactams was World War II and the requirement for penicillin
to be available for D-Day. In the application of the resources of
the UK and the US to the problem, coupled to its importance, it
can rightly be considered to be the microbiological equivalent
of the Manhattan Project.
The base structure of the penicillin molecule was new to
science when it was elucidated and since it acted by a
mechanism that targeted a structure unique to the bacterial cell
wall, it immediately became a structure ‘ripe for semi-
synthesis’. With the almost immediate realization that ‘mi-
crobes were smarter than man’, as they produced protective
enzymes, penicillinases or b-lactamases that degraded the
penicillins by opening the b-lactam ring, came the requirement
to produce/discover other, non-lactam antibiotics, and/or chem-
ically modify the basic penicillin nucleus to reduce or eliminate
the enzymic activity.
Almost all of the penicillins that have been made have started
from the simple fermentation-derived product 6-amino-pen-
icillanic acid (6-APA, 3), which is produced by a simple
chemical or biochemical deacetylation from penicillin G itself.
The actual number of 6APA-based structures that have been
made and tested by the pharmaceutical industry and associated
academic laboratories is unknown, as substantial numbers of
inactive materials or compounds with only minor increases in
potency were not reported in the literature, but it was well in
excess of 10000 in the late 1970s.14
In 1948, Brotzu15 reported on the ring-expanded molecule,
cephalosporin C (4), which was discovered from an isolate of a
‘pseudo’-marine fungus, Cephalosporium acremonium, taken
from a sewer outfall in Sardinia. Some of the same Oxford
group that had originally worked on penicillin G, and who had
seen but not isolated and purified the material at roughly the

same time as Brotzu, now isolated a weakly active agent from
the fungal extract and determined the structure of cephalosporin
C.16,17 Although very weakly antibacterial, it did not appear to
be susceptible to the then known b-lactamases and this finding,
coupled to the demonstration by chemists at Lilly that penicillin
G could be chemically expanded to give the cephalosporin C
nucleus, led to the same type of semi-synthetic effort in
producing modified cephalosporins as had been seen in the case
of the penicillins. An example is the first orally-available
cephalosporin, cephalexin (5). Originally, cephalosporins were
used to treat infections resistant to penicillins, but with the
advent of b-lactamases that were either specific for ceph-
alosporins, or attacked both ring systems, the search for more
resistant analogues continued.
A large effort was mounted in the late 1960s and early 1970s,
predominately by Beecham and Pfizer to find molecules that
would have pharmacokinetic properties similar to those of
penicillins but that would inhibit some or all of the common b-
lactamases. Beecham were successful in producing the mole-
cules known as clavulanates (6) from natural sources, and Pfizer
produced the semi-synthetic molecules known as the sulbac-
tams where the thiazole sulfur was oxidized to the sulfone 7. In
both cases, combination therapies were devised where mixtures,
usually equimolar in nature, were administered using a common
penicillin such as ampicillin or the more potent amoxicillin plus
the b-lactamase inhibitor. To give an idea of the value of these
patented combinations, in 1997 SKB sold over US$ 1.5 billion
of Augmentin® worldwide and the US patent does not expire
until 2002.18 As yet, a corresponding cephalosporin combina-
tion has not been marketed, though from the late 1980s workers
at Roche had reported on some interesting combination
antibiotics where two different nuclei (b-lactams and quino-
lones) were linked by esters,19 carbamates20 or via a tertiary
amine function21 and reported on their stability to three
common Gram-negative b-lactamases,22 showing that only the
compounds that contained the cefotaxime structure were stable
to two of the three enzymes used.
The search for a ‘simple b-lactam’ (i.e., an isolated single
ring) went on for many years, predominately in synthetic
chemistry laboratories. Again, Mother Nature proved to be the
superior chemist when in early 1981, Imada reported on the
sulfazecins23 8 and, within two months, Sykes et al. at Squibb
reported that after herculean efforts, involving over 1000000
small-scale fermentations, they successfully isolated the mono-
bactams including sulfazecin from aquatic organisms collected
almost in their own ‘backyard’.24 This was an entertaining
repetition of the search by the NRRL scientists for a high-
producing P. chrysogenum strain that they eventually found on
a rotting melon in a local fruit market in Peoria across from the
laboratory.13 With the identification of the naturally occurring
monobactam compounds, it became ‘chemically obvious’ why
Nature was the best chemist. Of all the synthetic modifications
made by medicinal chemists from Squibb, SmithKline and other
pharmaceutical houses, none had considered that an N-sulfonic
acid substituent would stabilize the b-lactam system. In a clever
move, the Squibb researchers then proceeded to synthesize and
patent all of the side-chain modifications that had been reported
to give improved activities in the penicillin and cephalosporin
series; an early compound in this series, aztreonam (Azactam®,
9) is currently used clinically.
4.2
Antibacterials: aminoglycosides
Concomitantly with the search for the penicillins, Waksman at
Rutgers University commenced a search for microbial metabo-
lites that would be active against the then (and perhaps now)
major scourge, tuberculosis. In 1943, the aminoglycoside
antibiotic streptomycin was isolated from Streptomyces griseus
and, in addition to being active against Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, it was also active against a wide range of other
bacterial infections. Further work, predominately by screening
metabolites from soil microbes of the Actinomycetales, led to
the identification and isolation of a large number of antibiotics
of similar structural types known generically as the aminoglyco-
sides. These materials are mainly used against Gram-negative
organisms, but due to their mechanism of action (inhibition of
protein synthesis), they also exhibit true synergy with pen-
icillins in vivo. Their major drawback in clinical use is the fairly
rapid build-up of resistance (to a large extent, plasmid-mediated
phosphorylases and acetylases) and their innate oto- and
nephro-toxicity, which means that treatments have to be very
carefully regulated. There have been some successful chemical
modifications to produce more resistant molecules (e.g. amika-
cin, 10), but in most cases, the isolated metabolite is used as the
drug.
4.3
Antibacterials: tetracyclines
The next major class of metabolites to be discovered and used
extensively were the tetracyclines. These were produced by
various Streptomyces sp. and had the then unique skeleton of
four linear fused rings. Although the parent molecule was not
used to any great extent as an antibacterial, the chlorinated
derivative, named Aureomycin® (11) because of its color, was.

----- Page 5 (native) -----
A large number of semi-synthetic tetracyclines have been made
and a significant number are still in use as first line therapy,
even though the parent molecule is almost fifty years old.
Amongst these are doxycycline (12) and minocycline (13).
Tetracycline has another ‘claim to fame’ in antibiotic therapy,
as it was this molecule that gave its name to the ‘tet resistance
pump’. In eubacteria, and in its homologous form in eukaryotes
(P130 glycoprotein), this pump gives rise to the phenomenon of
multidrug resistance (or MDR), where the toxic agent is
pumped out as fast as it is transported in (either by diffusion or
by an active ingress mechanism). Molecules based on the
tetracycline molecule have since been synthesized that will
block the tet pump, thus possibly permitting antibiotic therapy
with relatively cheap tetracyclines to be used again.25–27
4.4
Antibacterials: macrolides
The other extremely important Streptomyces metabolites are the
14-membered macrolides exemplified by erythromycin (14).
There are relatively large numbers of compounds with various
sizes of macrolide rings that have been isolated as a result of
screening campaigns in the antibiotics industry, but, of all of
them, those based on the erythronolide ring system have been
the most used, even though they have to have complex salts
made in order to generate oral activity. In a fairly recent
development, a chemical modification has been made to the
basic structure to overcome the resistance exhibited by strains
from most of the important pathogens to the base molecule.
These are the ‘aza-macrolides’ exemplified by Azithromycin®
(15), where a nitrogen has been chemically inserted into the
base macrolide ring, overcoming most if not all of the resistance
shown to erythromycin.28 The downside to such a molecule is
the expense of the synthetic process, thus pricing such
treatments beyond both developing and a number of developed
countries.
4.5
Antibacterials: synergistic mixtures of
streptogramins
In the early days of antibiotic discovery, a series of synergistic
mixtures were isolated from Streptomyces sp. and identified as
being extremely potent agents against Gram-positive organ-
isms. However, they had a major drawback, they were quite
toxic in comparison to the tetracyclines and erythromycin. They
were, however, developed as animal feed supplements and used
extensively in the US and in Europe (virginiamycins A and B
being an example).
With the advent of epidemics of methicillin-resistant Staphy-
lococcus aureus (MRSA), and the potential for larger outbreaks
of the glycopeptide-resistant entero- and staphylococci, came
the realization that we are very close to not having any
antibiotics left that will kill such resistant organisms. To make
matters worse, most of the big antibiotic-discovery companies
had down-sized their operations in the mid-1980s to early 1990s
time frame. Rhone-Poulenc in France had had a ‘franchise’ on
the streptogramin Pristinamycin, and in a series of elegant semi-
syntheses, modified the ‘A’ and ‘B’ components to produce the
water-soluble compounds, dalfopristin (16) (RP54476) and
quinuprisitin (17) (RP57669). The synergistic mixture (70+30
ratio) has now been approved by the US FDA under the name of
Synercid® (RP59500) for use against methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin resistant entero-
and staphylococci and drug-resistant S. pneumoniae.29–31
4.6
Antifungals: general
Unlike the antibacterial arena where, in relative terms, bacterial-
specific targets abound, fungi, being eukaryotic in nature, have
a metabolism similar to those of mammals, with differences in
the t-RNA-AA-acyltransferases (only found from proteoge-

nomics studies),32 portions of their steroid synthetase systems
and their carbohydrate-based cell walls. As a result, there are
few clinically viable antifungal agents, with the well known
amphotericin B (aka ‘ampho-terrible’ because of its side
effects) still being the gold standard against which other
antifungal agents are measured.
To date, no clinically effective antibiotic directed towards the
chitin synthetases has yet survived the testing process though a
lot of work was performed, starting in the late 1970s, in attempts
to chemically convert the peptidic antibiotics of the Nikkomy-
cin class into viable clinical candidates against C. albicans.
With these and similar agents, problems still arise with the
specificity of this organism’s peptide transport systems (cf.
McCarthy et al.33 for a discussion of these processes), thus the
following discussions will be of agents directed against other
targets.
4.7
Antifungals: lipopeptides
Though there have been many agents reported to have
antifungal activity in vitro, when they were tested in relevant
animal models, their ADME (absorption, distribution, metabo-
lism and excretion) characteristics were such that significant
chemistry had to be performed to obtain reasonable pharma-
cology.
Such operations were performed by Lilly on echinocandin in
order to produce cilofungin. This compound reached Phase II
clinical trials, and, following abandonment due to toxicity,
further modification of the structure produced LY303366,
culminating in the synthesis of its more soluble prodrug
LY307853 (18) by converting the phenolic hydroxy to a sodium
phosphate ester.34,35
Using a similar type of compound as the starting material,
pneumocandin A0, chemists at Merck have produced MK-0991
(19) which likewise demonstrates good activity against the
major human pathogen, C. albicans and other pathogenic fungi
from diverse genera.36
4.8
Antifungals: non-lipopeptides
Using a high throughput screen directed against protein
synthesis in Candida, Glaxo-Wellcome discovered that an
analogue of the previously known molecule sordarin was an
effective in vitro inhibitor, with apparent selectivity for fungal
protein synthesis. Following a long program of mutation and
medicinal chemistry, semi-synthetic derivatives of sordarin
were produced with the analogue GM237354 (20) entering
preclinical development.37
4.9
Antimalarials
The quintessential antimalarial lead was quinine, originally
isolated from Cinchona bark, acting as the template for the
synthetic agents of the chloroquine/mefloquine type. With the
rise of parasites resistant to these agents, came the search for
other synthetic and natural product-based agents. Inspection of
the data from Chinese herbal remedies led to the investigation of
extracts of Artemisia annua (Wormwood). This particular plant
had been used for centuries in China as an antimalarial38
(known as ‘Quinghaosu’) and in 1972, the active agent was
isolated and identified as a sesquiterpene endoperoxide named
artemisinin (21). In a recent review, Tan et al.39 reported that
this particular agent is not limited to the species annua, but is
found in at least two others. Using the base structure of
artemisinin, many semi-synthetic compounds were made with
the aim of optimizing the pharmacology of the base molecule,
leading to the identification of artemether, 22, (a relatively
simple modification of the actual active metabolite, dihy-
droartemisinin, 23) as a potent antimalarial agent that is now in
widespread use throughout the world. Other simple modifica-
tions have been made to improve solubility and distribution but,
in all cases, the active constituent ends up to be the same
molecule, so these can all be considered to be ‘prodrugs’ of
dihydroartemisinin (cf. Table IV in De Smet).40
It has been suggested from many in vitro and in vivo studies
that the active principle of artemisinin resides in the peroxide
bridge and that an iron-catalyzed conversion occurs to give an
electrophilic free radical composed of the majority of the
molecule. This compound then acylates proteins that are present
in the parasite but not, to any extent, in the host.41–43 With the
recognition that the peroxy bridge is essential for activity, came
the syntheses by many groups in both China and the West, of
compounds containing the basic artemisinin structure. The

major group in the USA working on these compounds has been
associated with the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research and
the papers by Avery et al. should be consulted for details.44–46
As time progressed, much simpler structures containing the
required peroxy bridge were synthesized (e.g. 24, 25) and they
retained nanomolar activity. Recent reviews of the work leading
to such molecules have been published by Posner et al.47,48
Natural products from marine sources also contain the
peroxy-bridge found in the artemisins, examples being the
norsesterterpenes sigmosceptrellin49 (26) and muqubilin50 (27)
from the Red Sea sponges Sigmosceptrella and Prianos. Other
similar molecules have also been reported by the Kashman
group51 from a South African Plakortis. At that time, their
potential as leads to antimalarials was not appreciated, though
later work by Hamann’s group at the University of Mississippi52
and Konig’s group at Braunschwieg53 have shown that a variety
of marine-derived structures may have potential as leads to
other antimalarial structures. It will be interesting to see how
these molecules act as leads versus those from plant sources.
In a very recent paper, workers in Germany54 have demon-
strated that a very simple series of microbial metabolites, the
fosmidomycins (28), originally reported by workers at Fuji-
sawa55,56 as Streptomyces metabolites, have antimalarial activ-
ity both in vitro and in vivo in rodent models. These simple
molecules appear to inhibit isoprenoid biosynthesis that is
dependent upon the DOXP pathway (from 1-deoxy-D-xylulose
5-phosphate) rather than the more usual HMG-CoA reductase
route. This discovery of a non-mammalian isoprenoid bio-
synthetic route in the parasite and the identification of an
inhibitor may well open up an entirely new route to anti-
malarials, particularly as synthetic routes to this type of
molecule have been published in detail57 and they appear to lend
themselves to parallel syntheses to produce a wide variety of
congeners.

Antiviral area: general
If one thinks that there is a paucity of effective antifungal
agents, then the antiviral area is positively barren by compar-
ison, in spite of the vast number of chemical compounds,
derived from natural sources, semi- or total synthesis, that have
been tested for their efficacy as antiviral agents. One major
reason for this is the very nature of a viral disease, in that the
virus, irrespective of type, effectively takes over an infected cell
and hence there are very few specific viral targets for small
molecules to interact with. With the advent of molecular cloning
techniques, however, the situation is changing as it is now
possible to identify specific viral-related proteins, clone them,
express them and then use in rapid screening systems, looking
for specific interactions in the absence of the host proteins.
Rather than deal with each type of viral infection, we have
elected to show how a serendipitous discovery of a series of
natural products has led to the plethora of similar compounds
that are now in preclincal or clinical evaluation, and in some
cases, in clinical use.
4.11
Antiviral area: nucleoside analogues
From 1950 to 1956, Bergmann et al.58–60 reported on two
compounds that they had isolated from marine sponges,
spongouridine (29) and spongothymidine (30). What was
significant about these materials was that they demonstrated, for
the first time, that naturally occurring nucleosides could be
found using sugars other than ribose or deoxyribose.
These two compounds can be thought of as the prototypes of
all of the modified nucleoside analogues made by chemists that
have crossed the antiviral and anti-tumor stages since then.
Once it was realized that biological systems would recognize
the base and not pay too much attention to the sugar moiety,
chemists began to substitute the ‘regular pentoses’ with acyclic
entities, and with cyclic sugars with unusual substituents.
These experiments led to a vast number of derivatives that
were tested extensively as antiviral and anti-tumor agents over
the next thirty plus years. Suckling, in a 1991 review61 showed
how such structures evolved in the (then) Wellcome laborato-
ries, leading to AZT and, incidently, to Nobel Prizes for
Hitchens and Elion, though no direct mention was made of the
original arabinose-containing leads from natural sources.
Showing that ‘Mother Nature’ may follow chemists rather
than the reverse, or conversely that it was always there but the
natural products chemists were ‘slow off the mark’, arabinosy-
ladenine (Ara-A or Vidarabine®, 31) was synthesized in 1960 as
a potential anti-tumor agent,62 but was later produced by
fermentation63 of S. griseus and isolated, together with
spongouridine,64 from a Mediterranean gorgonian (Eunicella
cavolini) in 1984.
Of the many compounds derived from these early discov-
eries, some, such as Ara-A, Ara-C, Acyclovir (32) and later

AZT and DDI, have gone into clinical use, but most have simply
become entries in chemical catalogues.
4.12
Antiviral area: HIV protease inhibitors
As mentioned above, there are few targets that are ‘virus-only’
in nature when it comes to screening, but in the case of HIV 1,
a specific target is the aspartic protease that is an essential part
of the processing of the viral proteins pol and gag that permit the
virus to replicate in the host cell.
The initial work on this protease by the Merck group
demonstrated that it was an aspartic proteinase and could be
inhibited by the microbial pepsin inhibitor, pepstatin. In fact,
inhibition by this peptide could be seen in both isolated enzymic
and in whole cell assays.65 Pepstatin (33) contains an unusual
hydroxy-amino acid, statine, which can be thought of as a
mimic of a putative transition state intermediate, where the
hydroxy group takes the place of a water molecule that is the
second substrate for the hydrolytic reaction.66 Using this
hypothesis, plus the idea that statine is acting as a dipeptide
replacement, two groups, one at Wisconsin and the other at
Merck, collaborated to produce renin inhibitors containing a
hydroxyethylene isostere that gave activity comparable to that
of pepstatin as a pepsin inhibitor.66 Concomitantly, studies with
replacement of amino acids in aspartic-proteinase substrates (in
general, 6 to 8 residues in length) with statine or isosteres, led to
the production of potent inhibitors of the aspartic proteinases,
renin and elastase.66
Once the investigators realized from the pepstatin results that
the activity of HIV 1 protease was due to the presence of the
same (or similar) catalytic site to that of renin, then the
collection of renin inhibitors was tested, leading to identifica-
tion of potential HIV 1 inhibitors. Using similar techniques to
those that proved fruitful with the renin and elastase systems,
variations around those inhibitors, and/or others based on a
short peptide that was the consensus substrate of HIV 1
protease, were synthesized using isosteric replacements for a
variety of the amino acids, but, in most cases, keeping the
‘statine-mimic’ aligned with the geometry of the active site.
These synthetic exercises based on a natural product model
have led to successful drug entities67,68 that are now available
for the clinical treatment of HIV infections, though the
molecules used, such as Crixivan® (34), show no formal
structural relationship to the original natural product inhibitor,
pepstatin.69–72

Cardiovascular: general
In our usage, cardiovascular diseases will cover the following
general areas. Control of the b-adrenergic nervous system
which will include some aspects of respiratory function, control
of cholesterol/lipid metabolism and control of angiotensin
levels. The underlying physiological principle that is addressed
in these areas is the homeostatic control of blood pressure.
5.1
Cardiovascular: the b-adrenergic amines
Although epinephrine (adrenaline, 35) was discovered from
natural sources (extraction of sheep adrenal glands) around the
turn of the 20th century and was marketed as a pharmaceutical,
it was not until the investigations by Chinese scientists in
Peking in the early 1920s that a reasonable source of what
eventually became known as the sympathomimetic amines was
identified.
The Chinese had known of the potential of the plants Ephedra
sinaica and E. equisetina73 for millenia as treatments for
asthmatic and other bronchial conditions and then, in 1923,
Chen obtained pure ephedrine (36) from E. sinaica and
demonstrated that its physiological actions were very similar to
adrenaline, causing elevation of blood pressure, plus inotropic
and chronotropic actions on the heart. Following regulatory
approval, it became the first in a very long line of bronchodila-
tors/CV agents.
Work between the world wars led to the identification of
other amino compounds based on the ephedrine basic structure,
with benzedrine and methamphetamine being widely issued
during WWII as stimulants. Following WWII, these compounds
became tightly regulated in most jurisdictions because of their
abuse potential. The next major development was the synthesis
of the molecule isoprenaline (Isoprel®, 37) by combining the o-
catechol ring with a modified amphetamine side-chain. This
molecule showed excellent activity as a bronchodilator without
significant action on blood pressure but it had significant
cardiac stimulant effects.
It was the subsequent work of Black (part of the studies for
which he ultimately received the Nobel Prize) that demonstrated
that there were two basic types of b-receptor, the b1, which is
predominately cardiac, and the b2 which is predominately
tracheal/lung. He, together with co-workers at ICI Pharmaceuti-
cals developed the first true b-blocker, propranolol74 (38). To
add to the ‘confusion’, the compounds that were being

developed at that time (the middle to late 1960s through the
1980s) could have both agonist and antagonist activities and, in
some cases, these activities could ‘partially cross-over’ and
show mixed agonist/antagonist activities. Chemical manipula-
tion around the basic structure, coupled to use of isolated
receptor assay techniques has led to compounds with much
better separation of the b-blocking activities such as atenolol
(39) and metaprolol (40) that have no detectable intrinsic
sympathomimetic activities.
Thus, starting with an agonist structure (ephedrine) that
significantly affected blood pressure due to its effect on cardiac
output and on release of other sympathomimetic amines, one
now has available related structures that are specific blockers of
such activities on cardiac tissue and are excellent ‘reducers of
hypertension’.
5.2
Cardiovascular: cholesterol lowering agents
Another major cause of elevated blood pressure is due to the
physical blockage of the arteries by plaques of cholesterol/
lipoproteins (atherosclerotic plaque). Since the human synthe-
sizes about 50% of its requirement for cholesterol, if the
synthesis can be inhibited, then a reduction in overall choles-
terol may reduce the deleterious effects of this steroid.
A potential site for inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis in
eukaryotes is at the rate-limiting step in the system, the
reduction of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A by HMG-
CoA reductase to produce mevalonic acid (41). By following
inhibition of sterol production and using fungal fermentation
broths as the source of natural products, Sankyo discovered
compactin (42) from a fermentation of Penicillium brevi-
compactum and patented it in 1975.75,76 Compactin was also
reported at the same time as an antifungal agent by Brown
et al.77 This material was shown to be a competitive inhibitor of
the enzyme with Kis in the nanomolar range, but it was not
developed further.
Using a similar assay, a homologue of compactin, mevinolin
(43) or 7-methylcompactin, was isolated by Sankyo from M.
ruber and reported in 197978,79 with a submission by Endo,
under the name Monacolin K, to the Japanese Patent Office for
the activity, but without a structure. Concomitantly, Merck
discovered the same material from A. terreus, using an isolated
HMG-CoA reductase assay and microbial broths as the source
of test agents. Merck reported the mevinolin discovery in 1980
in a communication in the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Science, USA80 and after submission of both
structure and findings to the Patent Office, a US Patent was
issued in late 1980.81 Following a very significant volume of
work, mevinolin became the first commercialized HMG-CoA-
reductase inhibitor in 1987.82,83
Further work using either chemical modification of the basic
structure (a la b-lactam modifications based on 6APA) or use of
biotransformation techniques led to two further compounds by
converting the 2-methylbutanoate side-chain into 2,2-dime-
thylbutanoate, giving simvastin (44), or opening of the
exocyclic lactone to give the free hydroxy acid, pravastatin
(45).
Data from 1997, the last year for which full sales information
is available, shows that these three natural-product derived
drugs are the second best-selling compounds in the world, with
combined sales of US$7.53 billion.18
Comparison of the ring-opened lactone structure common to
all of the ‘statins’ shows the resemblance to mevalonic acid and
this recognition led to the synthesis of the three synthetic
clinical products fluvastatin (46), cerivastatin (47) and atorvas-
tatin (48). The first two have the dihydroxy-heptenoic acid side-
chain of the fungal-derived products linked to a lipophilic ring
structure whilst the third uses the reduced form of the acid

directly linked to the heteroatom of a pyrrole ring. In the
nomenclature of Cragg et al.,84 these would be classified as S*
compounds; synthetic in nature but derived from a natural
product prototype.
5.3
Cardiovascular: angiotensin converting enzyme
inhibitors (ACE inhibitors)
The angiotensinogen to angiotensin I to angiotensin II cascade
is an essential mechanism in the maintenance of blood pressure
in humans and it was realized that if one could inhibit the
conversion of the decapeptide (angio I) into the biologically
potent octapeptide (angio II), then it might be possible to control
blood pressure by such compounds. In 1965, Ferreira85 reported
that fractions from the venom of the pit viper, Bothrops
jararaca, inhibited the degradation of the mammalian non-
apeptide, bradykinin. The enzyme that degraded this peptide, a
dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, was subsequently identified as
having ACE activity and was, in fact, the same enzyme working
with two different substrates.
The role of ACE in hypertension was identified as a result of
the work of Ondetti et al.86 demonstrating that the active
principle in the viper venom was a simple nonapetide, teprotide
(49). This material had specific activity as an ACE inhibitor and
also had hypotensive efficacy in clinical trials, though, due to a
lack of oral availability, it was a good lead but not a particularly
good drug candidate.
With the recognition that ACE was a metallo-enzyme came
the utilization of a similar carboxypeptidase (carboxypeptidase
A; a monopeptidyl-carboxypeptidase; CpdA) as a surrogate
model. Previous work by the Squibb group had shown that all of
the peptidic inhibitors of ACE had a C-terminal proline, and by
using this information, plus the fact that benzyl-succinic acid
was a specific inhibitor of CpdA, they derived a series of
carboxy- and mercapto-alkanoyl esters of proline that demon-
strated good to excellent inhibition of ACE. One of the
compounds (SQ14225), 50, subsequently became the proto-
typical ACE drug, Captopril®.86,87
Further development of the concepts shown in this work has
led to more potent ACE inhibitors as information as to ADME
and the specific spatial requirements of the ACE active site(s)
were further delineated. In some cases, the drugs that are used
are formally prodrugs, with cleavage of carboxylic esters in the
cases of Enalapril® (51) and Quinapril® (52), or of a
phosphinate ester in the case of Fosinopril® (53), to give the
active drug once in the circulation.

Pain/central nervous system: history
The conquest of pain was one of the major uses of medicinal
plants in the Ancient World, with the possible use of the crude
extract of the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) dating from
around 6000 years ago in Sumeria. However, the earliest
undisputed reference to the use of the ‘juice of the poppy’ is
from Theophrastus approximately 2300 years ago. The use of
opium, or laudanum as it was named by Paracelsus in the
sixteenth century, was popularized in both Europe and partic-
ularly in the Orient, even leading to the so-called “Opium Wars”
between the UK and China in the 1840s.
6.1
Pain/central nervous system: the opiates
Dioscorides first described the method of production from the
seeds of the poppy (cf. p. 175 in Mann12), and a similar method
is still used today. Crude ‘Opium’, the dried exudate, contains
about a quarter of its weight as opium alkaloids with morphine
and codeine being the major components with up to 20 more
distinct alkaloids including thebaine, papaverine and noscapine.
Morphine (54) was first isolated by Serturner in 1806, followed
by codeine (55) in 1832 by Robiquet and then the non-morphine
alkaloid papaverine by Merck in 1848. With the invention of the
hypodermic needle and the availability of the purified alkaloids,
the benefits and problems associated with widespread use of
these alkaloids rapidly became apparent88,89 leading to the
search for potent drugs without the abuse potential. Ironically,
heroin, the compound that has probably caused the most human
anguish since its preparation in the UK from morphine in 1874,
was marketed by Bayer from 1898 predominately as a cough
suppressant. A close relative, dextromethorphan (56), is in fact
used in most cough syrups today, but lacks the abuse potential
of its chemical cousin. Interestingly, there is now evidence that
morphinans (codeine and morphine at least) may be synthesized
in mammalian tissues as well.90,91

With the recognition of the abuse potential of the opiates
came the search to make compounds that mimicked morphine in
pain control but lacked the abuse potential. With the exception
of the semi-synthetic compound buprenorphine (57), which is
approximately 25–50 times more potent than morphine and has
a lower addiction potential, none of the compounds made to date
from modifications around the phenanthrene structure of
morphine have exceeded the pain control properties without a
concomitant addiction potential. Another interesting compound
whose structure is based on that of morphine, is pentazocine
(Talwin®, 58). This is about 30% as effective as morphine, but
with a much lower incidence of abuse and, in fact, will cause
withdrawal symptoms in morphine addicts at high dosage due to
antagonism at the morphine-active m-receptor.
Perhaps the major advance in the understanding (at least to
some molecular level) came from the work of investigators who
made the then novel assumption that the complex interactions
amongst this class of drugs could best be described by
suggesting that there were multiple opiod receptors for these
drugs.92 Following this, in 1973 three independent groups
(those of Terenius;93 Pert and Snyder;94 Simon, Hiller and
Edelman95) described receptor binding sites in the mammalian
nervous system. These sites were stereospecific and saturable
by varying opioid drugs. Following these discoveries and
confirming the suspicion that the body had a method of quelling
pain, came the isolation from porcine brain by Hughes and
Kosterlitz in Aberdeen in 1975 of two pentapeptides that
demonstrated opioid-like effects on guinea pig ileal strips.
These were named enkephalins and, following work by others
reported the same year, it was realized that there are at least
three distinct families of peptides that exhibit opioid-like
activities, the enkephalins, the endorphins and the dynorphins.96
Although a substantial amount of work was performed with
small peptide compounds based on these relatively simple
structures, none have succeeded as drugs to replace opioids as
yet (though see below under conotoxins). However, these small
peptides and synthetic derivatives derived from them have seen
extensive use as delineators of opioid receptor sub-types in
many tissues, not just those of the central nervous system.
Examples of some structures are given in the review by Sibinga
and Goldstein97 and in the paper by Kramer et al.98
6.2
Pain/central nervous system: the conotoxins
The cone snails (phylum Mollusca, genus Conus) with 500
species known are venomous marine animals that are predom-
inately found in the Western and South-western Pacific, though
there are some species found in Californian waters. Their
particular ‘expertise’ is that they stun/kill their prey through the
use of a disposable hollow tooth that contains a multitude of
peptidic toxins. One might even claim that Mother Nature
invented the disposable hypodermic needle, as their method of
delivery in most cases is via a harpoon-like hollow tooth that
breaks off once in the prey.
These animals would have simply been ‘just another
venomous marine organism’ but for the work of Olivera et
al.99,100 who demonstrated that the venom from each of these
animals contained over thirty polypeptides ranging in size from
10 to 35 amino acids and they demonstrated that specific
peptides gave specific physiologic responses in mammalian
systems (and by inference, in the piscatorial arena where they
were originally designed to work). From these original
discoveries has come the identification of a novel class of
analgesics that appear to specifically target a voltage gated Ca2+
channel, are very potent and have low probabilities for abuse.
Olivera101 has used the term ‘Janus-ligand’ for these peptidic
ligands as they appear to have both a ‘docking face’ and a
‘locking face’, thus giving exquisite selectivity and sensitivity
in the same molecule. The original material that has undergone
clinical development, and is currently in Phase III trial/awaiting
approval from the FDA, is SNX-111 (59) from Neurex
Corporation (now a part of Elan Pharmaceuticals). Though
made synthetically, it is in fact identical to MVIIA from Conus
geographicus.102 Many other synthetic variants have been made
and tested102 and will probably follow SNX-111, but for other
indications.
The potential for advances in other physiological areas as the
properties of the myriad of other peptides are investigated is
very high, showing the advantages of Nature’s combinatorial
chemistry approach with these molecules.
6.3
Pain/central nervous system: the epibatidines
In 1974, John Daly at the NIH isolated a small amount of a novel
alkaloid from the skin of an Ecuadorian poison frog (Epipedo-
bates tricolor) and demonstrated that it had excellent analgesic
effects in a particular mouse model. The material could not be
recollected and, without a structure, no further work was done.
With the advent of new NMR techniques in the late 1980s, the
750 micrograms remaining was enough to show that the
structure was a substituted chloronicotine, that was named
epibatidine103 (60). This molecule was synthesized and demon-
strated excellent inhibition of the nicotinic receptors in neurons
and neuromuscular junctions but with a lack of specificity
exemplified by its very low therapeutic index as referenced by
Ellis from UCB Research.104 In addition to Ellis’ group at UCB
Research, the Abbott group led by Decker105–107 have shown
the potential of this base molecule, and the manifold modifica-
tions that have been made have shown analgesic effects
mediated via one or more of the nAChR (nicotinic acetylcholine
receptor) subtypes in neuronal tissues. The structures shown in
these papers demonstrate the relative simplicity of these agents,
being predominately based on the nicotine/epibatidine locus. To
date, one compound from the Abbott group, ABT594 (61), has
reached advanced preclinical status. If it moves into Phase I, it
will be the first epibatidine derivative to cross that hurdle and
may demonstrate that specificity as to subtype will work in man
as well as mouse.

Antineoplastics: general
It is in the treatment of cancers and in anti-infective areas that
natural products have made their major impact as templates or
direct treatments. In the cancer area, of the 92 drugs commer-
cially available prior to 1983 in the United States, or approved
worldwide between 1983 and 1994, approximately 62% can be
related to a natural product origin, ignoring those of biological
origin such as interferon or recombinately produced cyto-
kines.84
A common feature with many of the natural product-derived
anticancer drugs now in clinical use is that the original natural
product was too toxic. Chemists therefore, had to make semi-
synthetic compounds based on the natural product structures
that had the more deleterious problems of the natural product
diminished by selective modification. In some cases, notably
that of mitoxantrone (62), a totally synthetic product evolved
but with the attributes of two or more parent natural product
structures in one molecule.84
7.1
Antineoplastics: plant sources
Although plants have a long history of use in the treatment of
cancer,108 many, if not all, of the claims for the efficacy of such
treatment should be viewed with some skepticism because
cancer, as a specific disease entity, is poorly defined in terms of
folklore and traditional medicine.109
Amongst the best known are the so-called vinca alkaloids,
vinblastine (63) and vincristine (64), isolated from the Mada-
gascan periwinkle, Catharanthus roseus. C. roseus was used by
various cultures for the treatment of diabetes, and these
compounds, together with two other related active alkaloids,
vinleurosine and vinrosidine, were isolated during an investiga-
tion of the plant as a source of potential oral hypoglycemic
agents. Therefore, the discovery of the initial two compounds
may be indirectly attributed to the observation of an unrelated
medicinal use of the source plant.109 Selective chemical
modifications of these two molecules have led to two semi-
synthetic compounds (from many) being approved in Europe
for cancer treatment, vinorelbine (65) and vindesine (66). The
former was recently approved in the US and the latter is in US
clinical trials.110
The parent of the two clinically-active agents etoposide (67)
and teniposide (68) is epipodophyllotoxin. This is the naturally
occurring epimer of podophyllotoxin (69) which was isolated as
the active anti-tumor agent from the roots of various species of
the genus Podophyllum. These plants possess a long history of
medicinal use by early American and Asian cultures, including
the treatment of skin cancers and warts.109 Although podo-
phyllotoxin was investigated at length by the NCI as a potential
anti-tumor agent it was shelved due to intractable toxicity
problems. Subsequent elegant work by Sandoz, prior to its
merger with Ciba-Geigy, led to the synthesis from epipodo-
phyllotoxin of etoposide and teniposide, both of which are in
general clinical use. Further work by Nippon Kayaku has led to
a water-soluble derivative of etoposide, NK-611 (70), where a
dimethylamino group was placed into the sugar ring, thus giving
significant water solubility; the material is now in clinical trials
(cf. references 60 to 62 in the recent review by Wang111). Two
recent reviews covering work at the University of North
Carolina, give information on the semi-synthetic derivatives
based on the podophyllotoxins112 and the earlier review covers
inhibitors of topoisomerase I and II either from natural sources
or based upon natural products.113 These reviews should be read

in conjunction with this article as further examples of where
natural product-derived templates for anti-tumor agents have
led to in a synthetic sense.
Camptothecin (71) was isolated from the Chinese ornamental
tree Camptotheca acuminata by Wani and Wall114 contempora-
neously with the initial discovery of Taxol®. As the sodium salt,
camptothecin was advanced to clinical trials by NCI in the
1970s, but was dropped because of severe bladder toxicity. It
was resurrected as a result of its very specific biochemical
activity as an inhibitor of topoisomerase I and the efforts of one
of the earliest NCI National Cooperative Drug Discovery
Groups (NCDDGs) involving Johns Hopkins University and the
then SmithKline Beckman. From these studies eventually came
the modified camptothecin, topotecan (Hycamptin®) (72),
which was approved for use in the USA in 1996. Other groups
modified the basic structure in slightly different ways,114
leading to the approved agent irinotecan (Camptosar®) (73), and
two others awaiting approval, 9-amino- (74) and 9-nitro-
camptothecin (75).
The complex diterpene Taxol® 76 (Paclitaxel) initially was
isolated from the bark of Taxus brevifolia, collected in
Washington State as part of a random collection program by the
U.S. Department of Agriculture for the National Cancer
Institute.115 Historically, parts of the yew tree (T. brevifolia and
other Taxus species) had been used by several Native American
tribes for the treatment of some non-cancerous conditions,108
and leaves of T. baccata are used in the traditional Asiatic
Indian (Ayurvedic) medicine system,6 with one reported use in
the treatment of ‘cancer’108
Paclitaxel, along with several key precursors (the baccatins),
occurs in the leaves of various Taxus species, and the ready
semi-synthetic conversion of the relatively abundant baccatins
into paclitaxel, as well as to active paclitaxel analogs, such as
docetaxel116 (77), has provided a major, renewable natural
source of this important class of drugs. Using the baccatins as
starting materials, many semi-synthetic taxanes have been
synthesized in an effort to obtain materials that have better
solubility in aqueous environments. A recent paper by Kingston
et al. demonstrates the methods used to prepare more active
2-acyl analogues of paclitaxel117 and covers, in its references,
the many modifications that workers have made to the basic
taxane skeleton in efforts to better understand the SAR of
tubulin binding and activity.
The flavone, flavopiridol (78), is currently in Phase I/II
clinical trials against a broad range of tumors.118 While
flavopiridol is totally synthetic, the basis for its novel structure
is the natural product rohitukine (79) isolated from Dysoxylum
binectariferum.119 Flavopiridol has a very interesting mecha-
nism of action in that it is an inhibitor of cyclin dependent
kinases (the regulators of the G2 to M transition in the cell
cycle). This discovery has led to a series of compounds (the
paullones as exemplified by structure 80) from the NCI open
compound database that, though not natural products, would not
have been discovered except for the use of the natural product-
derived agent as a ‘seed compound’. This story is given in detail
in a recent paper by Sausville et al.120 Other recent papers
dealing with discovery and modification around the paullone
structure are those of Schultz et al.121 and Zaharevitz et al.122
Flavopiridol is not the only CDK inhibitor discovered from a
natural source and then extended to give semi-synthetic and
synthetic compounds with a variety of potencies and specific-
ities. Workers associated with Meijer’s group in France have
published extensively on the potential of the highly related
purine analogues, olomoucine (81) and roscovitine (82) as CDK
inhibitors.123–125 These naturally occurring purine analogues
are competitive inhibitors with ATP and were thus thought to
bind at the ATP site in the protein. This was confirmed when the

structures of the protein inhibitor complexes were solved at high
resolution126,127 confirming the results from the enzyme
inhibition studies. The two natural products were not of
sufficient potency for use in in vivo experiments and these
findings led groups to use combinatorial chemistry techniques
to optimize the ‘natural product backbones’ of these two
substituted purines. Work from Schultz’ group at Berkeley was
reported in 1998128 and then more complete reviews from the
same group were published in 1999.129,130 Comparison of the
structures of purvalanols A (83) and B (84) with olomoucine
and roscovitine show that only very small changes in the side-
chains are enough to alter the IC50 figures by three orders of
magnitude. The interesting aspect, however, is that the base
structure is effectively that of the natural products, thus
demonstrating the value of using combinatorial chemistry
techniques to optimize an existing active structure rather than
attempting to synthesize de novo.
For a more general review of the history of CDK inhibitors
and a discussion of structures and derivatives in addition to
those mentioned above, a majority of which are natural product
based, the reader should consult the recent review by Web-
ster,131 though, because this is such a fast-moving area, any
review will be outdated by the time it is published.

Antineoplastics: microbial sources
Anti-tumor antibiotics are amongst the most important of the
cancer chemotherapeutic agents, which include members of the
anthracycline, bleomycin, actinomycin, mitomycin and aureolic
acid families.132 Clinically useful agents from these families are
the daunomycin-related agents, daunomycin itself, doxorubicin
(85), the semi-synthetic derivatives idarubicin and epirubicin;
the glycopeptidic bleomycins A2 and B2 (blenoxane); the
peptolides exemplified by dactinomycin (86); the mitosanes
such as mitomycin C (87); and the glycosylated anthracenone,
mithramycin. Except for the semi-synthetic compounds, all
were isolated from various Streptomyces species.
That there is still a lot to be learned from old molecules was
demonstrated by Hecht from the University of Virginia, who in
a plenary lecture133 at the November, 1999 AACR-NCI-
EORTC meeting on Molecular Targets and Cancer Ther-
apeutics demonstrated that bleomycin might well be targeting
amino acid t-RNA’s. He subsequently outlined a simple
polymer bead-based split and pool technique that his group is
using in order to produce 105 bleomycins within the foreseeable
future in order to search for a molecule that is only t-RNA
specific.
A current notable series of microbially-derived anti-tumor
compounds are those directed around the staurosporin nucleus
88. These include UCN-01 (7-hydroxystaurosporine, 89),
isolated from a Streptomyces species, though now made by
chemical modification of staurosporin itself and many other
derivatives, with the Novartis agent CGP41251134 (90) and
UCN-01 being in clinical trials. Novartis scientists have also
recently reported that this analogue may have multiple modes of
action, inhibiting angiogenesis in vivo in addition to its PKC
inhibitory activity. If this translates into inhibition of human
angiogenesis and subsequent anti-tumor activity then it distin-
guishes this agent from other staurosporin congeners.135
Perhaps the most interesting discovery from the microbial
world over the last few years is the series of compounds known
as the epothilones. These were originally isolated from species
of myxobacteria by Hofle in Germany136,137 and simultane-

ously by workers at Merck in the USA.138 Various problems
over patents and biological activities prevented epothilones A
(91) and B (92) from being developed by companies; this
despite the fact that the Merck group had demonstrated that they
mimicked paclitaxel in their interactions with tubulin in their
initial paper. Once the German group was able to assign the
absolute stereochemistry,139 then multiple groups began at-
tempts to synthesize the epothilones.
Three groups have made major contributions to the synthesis
of this class of compounds, those of Danishefsky at Sloan-
Kettering who were the first to synthesize epothilone A, the
second by Nicolaou at the Scripps Research Institute and the
third by Schinzer in Braunschweig, close to the birthplace of the
natural epothilones. Rather than go into the details of each
individual group’s synthetic strategies, the reader should
consult the excellent recent review by Nicolaou et al.140 on the
epothilones. This review shows the synthetic strategies of the
groups but, more importantly, shows the classical synthetic and
combinatorial efforts around the structures that have led to third
and fourth generation compounds now heading towards clinical
development. The activity data (cf. Tables 7 and 8 in the
Nicolaou review140) that are shown in these tables for some of
the classical synthetically and combinatorially derived deriva-
tives against paclitaxel-resistant cell lines are demonstrative of
the power of modern synthetic chemistry when applied to an
active natural product structure.
Recently, Ojima et al.141 showed that a non-aromatic mimic
of paclitaxel, nonataxel (93) was more effective than paclitaxel
in vitro and was amenable to solution NMR analyses in order to
determine solution conformation. Using this information to-
gether with the published data for three other quite diverse anti-
mitotic agents, discodermolide, eleutherobin and epothilone B,
they were able to suggest a common pharmacophore that could
account for the activities seen against tubulin by these agents
and paclitaxel. A presentation by the NCI group and their
collaborators142 at the AACR-NCI-EORTC Conference on
Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics in November, 1999
proposed a modified pharmacophore. Their structure differed
from the Ojima model by requiring the baccatin and the
epothilone skeletons to maintain similar conformations permit-
ting the required phenyl and ester linkages to be in their correct
spatial relationships for maximal reaction with the binding sites.
This model explained the tubulin cross-resistance profiles seen
for paclitaxel-resistant cell lines.
7.3
Antineoplastics: marine sources
The first notable discovery of biologically-active compounds
from marine sources was the serendipitous isolation of the C-
nucleosides spongouridine and spongothymidine (cf. Antiviral
section for further discussion) from the Caribbean sponge
Cryptotheca crypta in the early 1950s. These compounds were
found to possess antiviral activity, and synthetic analog studies
eventually led to the development of cytosine arabinoside (Ara-
C) (94) as a clinically useful anticancer agent approximately 15
years later.143 The systematic investigation of marine environ-
ments as sources of novel biologically active agents only began
in earnest in the mid-1970s. During the decade from
1977–1987, about 2500 new metabolites were reported from a
variety of marine organisms. These studies have clearly
demonstrated that the marine environment is a rich source of
bioactive compounds, many of which belong to totally novel
chemical classes not found in terrestrial sources.144
As yet, no compound isolated from a marine source has
advanced to commercial use as a chemotherapeutic agent,
though several are in various phases of clinical development as
potential anticancer agents. One of these is bryostatin 1 (95),
isolated from the bryozoan Bugula neritina.145,146 This agent
exerts a range of biological effects, thought to occur through
modulation of protein kinase C, and has shown some promising
activity against melanoma in Phase I studies,147 and showed
some stabilization of disease progression148 in Non-Hodgkin’s
Lymphoma (NHL). Further Phase I/II trials are either in
progress or are planned against a variety of tumors, including
ovarian carcinoma and NHL, with bryostatin as both mono-
therapy or as an adjunct to other compounds (further informa-
tion is on the NCI’s web site at cancernet.nci.nih.gov).
Although bryostatin is still produced by isolation from the
bryozoan, whether by aquaculture or by wild collection, work
has progressed on the synthesis of simpler analogs with
comparable activity. In 1988, Wender et al.149 suggested a
simplified pharmacophore model to explain the binding charac-
teristics of the bryostatins to PKC. They followed this proposal
up by synthesizing a series of simplified macrolide structures
that they demonstrated had both PKC binding and cytotoxic
activities of the same order as the bryostatins. Wender’s group
have reported at length on these compounds in a series of recent
communications150–154 and the structure of their most active
compound (96) from the first series is shown.

trials but under the auspices of the Spanish company Pharma-

Mar rather than the NCI, is ecteinascidin 743 (97) from the
shallow water tunicate Ecteinascidea turbinata. Two groups,
those of Rinehart et al.155 and Wright et al.,156 reported
simultaneously on this compound from similar sources. An
interesting speculation from the structure of Et743 (the usual
abbreviation for ecteinascidin 743) is that the actual producing
organism is a commensal microbe as the structures of these
molecules resemble the saframycins157,158 (98) from Strepto-
myces lavendulae and renieramycins159 (99) from the Pacific
sponge, Reniera sp.
Due to the very low levels of Et743 in the tunicate and the
problems of amassing enough material for large clinical trials
and/or commercial use, Corey developed a synthesis of Et743
and reported it in 1996.160 As mentioned by Corey in the
discussion in this publication, Et 743 was made in ‘relatively’
high yield but, perhaps more importantly, the synthetic methods
used opened up the potential for synthetic approaches to
derivatives or to simpler compounds such as the saframycins.
That this was a prescient comment was demonstrated by the
publication in 1999 of simpler structures related to Et 743 made
from a common intermediate in the original synthetic schema.
The best compound of those reported was named phthalascidin
(100), which demonstrated comparable activity to Et 743 in all
the in vitro systems that it was tested in, including the NCI 60
cell line panel.161
The last marine examples to be discussed are materials that
are still in preclinical stages of development. What is important
about these compounds, however, is that they have spawned
both total syntheses and then a number of combinatorial
libraries that have succeeded in optimizing the in vitro activity
of one of them. Secondly, the original compounds (in their
synthetic versions) and their derivatives have been used to
further delineate the binding characteristics of compounds to
tubulin.
The compounds are from two series of related compounds,
each containing the eunicellane carbon skeleton, a diterpene
first reported in 1968 from the gorgonian octocoral Eunicella
stricta.162 One series was glycosylated, the eleutherobin/
eleuthosides, the other being effectively their aglycone, the
sarcodicytins.
The sarcodicytins (101) were first reported as compounds by
Pietra’s group, following their isolation from the Mediterranean
stoloniferan coral Sarcodictyon roseum in 1987163 and in
1988.164 These reports were followed almost ten years later by
an abstract from workers at Pharmacia-Upjohn presented at the
1997 American Association for Cancer Research Meeting.165
This report demonstrated that the sarcodicytins had a paclitaxel-
like action on tubulin.
In 1994, during the intervening ten years from the original
report on the sarcodicytins to that of their activity, workers in
Fenical’s group at The Scripps Institute of Oceanography
discovered a related compound from the Western Australian
coral, Eleutherobia sp. They named the compound eleutherobin
(102) and showed that it contained the eunicellane skeleton but,
unlike the sarcodictyins, it was glycosylated in a manner similar
to that of the eleuthosides. What was unique, at that time, was
its activity against tubulin where it mimicked pacilitaxel. The
compound, and its activity, were first reported in the patent
literature166 followed by the chemical167 and biological168
publications.
In a prime example of what the late British historian of
science Derek De Solla-Price termed the ‘invisible college’, two
excellent synthetic chemists, Nicolaou at the Scripps Research
Institute and Danishevsky at Memorial Sloan Kettering suc-

ceeded in synthesizing both the sarcodictyins and eleutherobin.
In a series of recent papers both groups described their
respective synthetic methods, with Nicolaou’s group being the
first to press with a total synthesis of sarcodictyin A and the core
of eleutherobin.169 This publication was then followed by a very
rapid series of papers from both groups.170–174 In the middle of
this series of papers, Lindel, who was one of the discoverers of
eleutherobin, published a short historical review of the
discovery and the relative synthetic methods used by the
groups.175
The crux of the synthetic efforts from a drug discovery
aspect, however, was the paper by Nicolaou’s group that
described the derivation of combinatorial libraries built around
the solid and solution phase synthetic methods that they
developed for the sarcodictyins.176 In an elegant biochemical
paper by Hamel et al.177 the authors demonstrated the effects of
one of these compounds, a compound that has some aspects of
eleutherobin but without the sugar moiety (compound 1, 103),
upon binding to tubulin. In their conclusions they make two
telling points:
‘Like sarcodictyin A compound 1 interacts poorly with tubulin,
but like eleutherobin compound 1 has substantial antiprolifer-
ative activity.’
‘The activity of this agent (compound 1) in cells suggests that
further synthetic efforts with the sarcodictyin class would yield
compounds with activities greater than those of paclitaxel in
cells and perhaps with tubulin as well.’
Both of these quotes show the efficacy of using combinatorial
chemistry techniques around the skeleton of an active natural
product in an attempt to optimize both molecular recognition
sites and transport across cell membranes.
It is tempting to speculate that similar biochemical and
chemical experiments are going on with other active com-
pounds in this area; we will, however, have to await publication
of results in either the patent or general literature to see if these
speculations are correct.

Future trends: general
Rather than discuss each disease area from the viewpoint of
future trends, it is tempting to suggest that there are areas of
natural product research that are ‘blooming’ in-so-far as
derivation of unusual or even ‘un-natural’ structures are
concerned, and that, in the not too distant future, they will
become major sources of novel agents with pharmacological
promise.
8.1
Future trends: production of ‘previously unknown
structures’
What we are referring to is the marriage of genetic information
on biochemical pathways with the manifold techniques of ‘gene
manipulation’. This work was pioneered by Hopwood178 in the
1970s with initial attempts to produce hybrid antibiotics using
protoplast fusion techniques in the Streptomyces. With the
advent of recombinant DNA technology, the identification of
biosynthetic pathways to antibiotics and the ability to screen
large number of clones for expression of particular activities at
low expression levels, these technologies have the potential to
produce very unusual compounds that are true hybrids of
different biosynthetic pathways.179–183 Recently McDaniel et
al.184 reported on the ability to interchange modules in different
type I polyketide synthases (PKSs) and Shen et al.185 were able
to express three genes from the other type (type II) of PKS
systems. In a very recent paper Zhao et al.186 reported the
‘combinatorial biosynthesis’ of methymycin or pikromycin
aglycones coupled to the sugar from a totally unrelated
antibiotic, calcheamicin. A recent review article by Hutch-
inson,187 from the University of Wisconsin, who is also a
pioneer in this field, should be consulted for further information
on these techniques and their import in drug discovery.
In addition to the ‘directed techniques’ referred to above,
where the biosynthetic genes are identified and then ‘mixed and
matched’, there is another source of unusual/unknown struc-
tures that is currently being actively investigated, the ‘as yet
uncultured microbes’. Pioneers in this field are Colwell,188 who
described the recognition of visible but uncultured bacteria in
marine environments and Handelsman and her collaborators for
similar discoveries with terrestrial bacteria.189 By isolating
gross DNA from these sources, followed by clean-up, separa-
tion into eukaryotic and prokaryotic DNA pools, cloning by a
variety of means in suitable hosts and then screening of the hosts
for expression of novel activities and/or chemical entities a vast
new area of chemical diversity may be opened up.
That these techniques are viable as sources of new structures
and agents can be seen from the companies that have been set up
to study these techniques and their academic linkages. Exam-
ples are Kosan Biosciences with Chaitan Khosla (University of
California, Berkeley) and TerraGen Bidiversity (Julian Davies,
University of British Columbia), plus two others that have
changed names and affiliations over the years, Diversa and
ChromoXome.
8.2
Future trends: the optimization of lead structures
In this, bioactive natural product lead structures would be
identified and then new agents with improved pharmacokinetics
and/or toxicology synthesized. This is ‘optimization of a lead
structure’, but instead of using the classical medicinal chemistry
techniques, rapid combinatorial/parallel synthesis methods
would be applied.190 That these are viable strategies for deriving
‘new and improved’ molecules can be seen from the earlier
discussions under anti-tumor agents, in particular the work
around paclitaxel, epothilones and sarcodictyins. What is also
becoming evident is that the synthesis of complex natural
products is no longer an end in itself. The molecules that are
used are themselves becoming substrates for combinatorial
approaches or as sources of simplified molecules, as shown by
the work on bryostatins and on ecteinascidins, where simpler
but biologically active molecules have been made as a result of
synthetic endeavors.
8.3
Future trends: novel delivery systems for ‘old
compounds’
As a result of the massive screening that has been carried out in
antibiotic and anti-tumor discovery programs, there are sig-

nificant numbers of very potent natural product compounds that
have the required biological activity but at the expense of a very
low therapeutic index. Since, under normal conditions of
testing, these materials would have to be administered non-
specifically (i.e. dosing the whole animal), a high toxicity is a
significant problem. If such agents could be delivered to the
tumor area on the other hand, then it might well be possible to
use very toxic materials for treatment.
There are a variety of methods that can be used for such
delivery systems; the two that have been studied most
extensively in the past are use of liposome-encapsulated toxic
agents191 and antibody-conjugates with natural toxins192 (i.e.
ricin) or pure compounds such as calcheamicin and doxor-
ubicin. A further modification would be to use a prodrug and an
enzyme-coupled antibody to release the material at the site.193
Over the last few years, another novel strategy for delivery of
anticancer drugs to the tumor site has been proven clinically.
This is the use of a water-soluble copolymer with a warhead
attached. A driving force in this area has been the group now at
the University of London’s School of Pharmacy.194 They,
originally in conjunction with a polymer group at Prague and
then with Farmitalia (now part of Pharmacia-Upjohn), success-
fully coupled doxorubicin to an N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacry-
lamide (HPMA) copolymer to produce the construct known as
PK1. By adding a targeting sugar moiety to PK1, a construct
(PK2) that targeted the liver was made and some preliminary
imaging results from the Phase I trials have been reported.195
PK1 is now in Phase II trials in the UK, and PK2 has just
completed its first Phase I trial, also in the UK.195–198 This work
has now been extended to cover platinum complexes as well,
with the first in vivo preclinical results being reported.199
Two final points:
(1)
an analysis of the compounds mentioned in the 694 posters
presented at the AACR-NCI-EORTC Molecular Targets
and Cancer Therapeutics meeting in November 1999,
showed that of the 433 molecular entities mentioned, 264
fell into the N/ND or S* categorizations of Cragg et
al.84
(2)
In an ASAP paper in Organic Letters, Smith et al.200
published their gram-scale synthesis of the tubulin-active
marine natural product, discodermolide. This synthesis
may well open the way to combinatorial development of a
large number of related compounds for this agent, which is
currently in preclinical development as an anti-tumor
agent.
Thus, in closing, as can be seen from the above discussions,
and as referred to by other reviewers,201,202 ‘the notification of
the demise of natural products as leads to drug entities is highly
premature’ (with apologies to Mark Twain).
