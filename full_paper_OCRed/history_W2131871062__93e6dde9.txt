Lancelets (‘amphioxus’) are the modern survivors of an ancient chordate lineage, with a fossil record dating back to the
Cambrian period. Here we describe the structure and gene content of the highly polymorphic ,520-megabase genome of the
Florida lancelet Branchiostoma floridae, and analyse it in the context of chordate evolution. Whole-genome comparisons
illuminate the murky relationships among the three chordate groups (tunicates, lancelets and vertebrates), and allow not
only reconstruction of the gene complement of the last common chordate ancestor but also partial reconstruction of its
genomic organization, as well as a description of two genome-wide duplications and subsequent reorganizations in the
vertebrate lineage. These genome-scale events shaped the vertebrate genome and provided additional genetic variation for
exploitation during vertebrate evolution.
Lancelets, or amphioxus, are small worm-like marine animals that
spend most of their lives buried in the sea floor, filter-feeding through
jawless, ciliated mouths. The vertebrate affinities of these modest
creatures were first noted in the early part of the nineteenth cen-
tury1,2, and were further clarified by the embryologist Alexander
Kowalevsky3. In particular, Kowalevsky observed that, unlike other
invertebrates, amphioxus shares key anatomical and developmental
features with vertebrates and tunicates (also known as urochordates).
These include a hollow dorsal neural tube, a notochord, a perforated
pharyngeal region, a segmented body musculature (embryologically
derived from somites) and a post-anal tail. Together, the vertebrates,
urochordates and lancelets (also known as cephalochordates) con-
stitute the phylum Chordata, descended from a last common
ancestor that lived perhaps 550 million years ago.
Although Kowalevsky, Darwin and others recognized the evolu-
tionary relationship between chordate groups, the greater morpho-
logical, physiological and neural complexity of vertebrates posed a
puzzle: how did the chordate ancestor—presumably a simple crea-
ture that resembled a modern amphioxus or ascidian larva—make
such a transition?
Perhaps the most prevalent hypothesis for the origins of vertebrate
complexity is founded on the ideas of Susumu Ohno (1970)4, who
proposed that vertebrate genomes were shaped by a series of ancient
genome-wide duplications. In Ohno’s original proposal, lancelet and
vertebrates genomes were enlarged relative to the basic invertebrate
complement by one or two rounds of genome doubling, although
subsequent work suggested that these events occurred on the verte-
brate stem after divergence of the lancelet lineage5,6.
Although the sequencing of the human and other vertebrate gen-
omes has shown that the gene number in vertebrates is comparable to,
or only modestly greater than, that of invertebrates7,8, evidence for
large-scale segmental or whole-genome duplications on the vertebrate
stem has mounted, with the parallel realization that most gene dupli-
cates from such events are rapidly lost (reviewed in ref. 9). The rela-
tively few surviving gene duplicates from the vertebrate stem provide
evidence for ancient paralogous relationships between groups of
human chromosomes10–14 that plausibly arose from multiple rounds
of whole-genome duplication before the emergence of modern verte-
brates. However, the number, the timing and even the genomic scale
of the duplication events, and their consequences for subsequent gen-
omeevolution,arepoorlyunderstood(for areview,seeref.15),inpart
because the tunicate genomes are highly rearranged relative to the
unduplicated early chordate karyotype (see below).
The Florida lancelet B. floridae (the generic name Branchiostoma
refers to the characteristic perforated branchial arches) provides a
critical point of reference for these studies16. This species and its

relatives (collectively also known as amphioxus, derived from the
Greek amphi1oxys, ‘sharp at both ends’) are widely regarded as living
proxies for the chordate ancestor, in part owing to the general sim-
ilarity of the modern amphioxus to putative fossil chordates from the
early Cambrian Chengjiang fauna (Yunnanozoon lividum17, and the
similar Haikouella lanceolatum18) and the middle Cambrian Burgess
Shale (Pikaia gracilens19), although controversy remains (see, for
example, refs 20,21). The study of key developmental genes in amphi-
oxus has shed light on the evolution of such vertebrate organs as the
brain, kidney, pancreas and pituitary, and of the genetic mechanisms
of early embryonic patterning in general (reviewed by refs 22–24).
Amphioxus has also served as a genomic surrogate for the proto-
vertebrate ancestor in studies of the Hox cluster25, in studies of spe-
cific genomic regions26–28, and as an outgroup in numerous gene
family studies (reviewed in ref. 29).
Here we report the draft genome sequence of the Florida lancelet
and compare its structure with the genomes of other animals. Robust
phylogenetic analysis of gene sequences and exon–intron structures
confirms recent proposals that tunicates are the sister group to verte-
brates, with lancelets as the most basal chordate subphylum, and that
the combined echinoderm–hemichordate clade is sister to chordates.
Through a comparative analysis, we identify 17 ancestral chordate
linkage groups that are conserved in the modern amphioxus and
vertebrate genomes despite over half a billion years of independent
evolution. Over 90% of the human genome is encompassed within
these linkage groups, which display a tell-tale fourfold redundancy
that is consistent with whole-genome quadruplication on the verte-
brate stem. Comparison with sequences from the sea squirt, lamprey,
elephant shark and several bony fish constrains the timing of the
whole-genome events to after the divergence of vertebrates from tuni-
cates and lancelets, but before the split between cartilaginous and
bony vertebrates. Within the resolution of our analysis, we find evid-
ence for rounds of genome duplication both before and after the split
between jawless vertebrates (for example, lamprey) and jawed verte-
brates, although a period of octoploidy encompassing the divergence
of jawless and jawed vertebrates remains a possibility. Although
most duplicate genes from these whole-genome events have been
lost, a disproportionate number of genes involved in developmental
processes are retained.
Genome sequence
We sequenced the ,520 megabase (Mb) amphioxus genome using a
whole-genome shotgun strategy30 from approximately 11.5-fold
redundant paired-end sequence coverage produced from random-
sheared libraries with a range of insert sizes (Supplementary Note 2).
Genomic DNA was prepared from the gonads of a single gravid male
collected from Tampa Bay, Florida in July 2003, and exhibited
extensive allelic variation (3.7% single nucleotide polymorphism,
plus 6.8% polymorphic insertion/deletion; Supplementary Note 4).
This is the highest level of sequence variation reported in any indi-
vidual organism, exceeding that found in the purple sea urchin31.
Assembly version 1 reports both haplotypes separately, whereas in
assembly version 2 a single haplotype is selected at each locus
(Supplementary Fig. 63). Assembly version 2 spans 522 Mb, with half
of this sequence in 62 scaffolds longer than 2.6 Mb.
Currently there are no physical or genetic maps of amphioxus, so
we could not reconstruct the genome as its 19 pairs of chromo-
somes32. Nevertheless, because half of the predicted genes are con-
tained in scaffolds containing 138 or more genes, the current draft
assembly is sufficiently long-range to permit useful analysis of con-
served synteny with other species, as shown below. Comparison of
the assembled sequence with open reading frames derived from
expressed sequence tags (ESTs, see below) shows that the assembly
captures more than 95% of the known protein-coding content, and
comparison to finished clone sequences demonstrates the base-level
and long-range accuracy of the assembly (Supplementary Note 2).
Protein-coding genes and transposable elements
We estimate that the haploid amphioxus genome contains 21,900
protein-coding loci. This gene complement was modelled with
standard methods tuned for amphioxus, integrating homology and
ab initio gene prediction methods with more than 480,000 ESTs
derived from a variety of developmental stages24 (Supplementary
Note 3). Approximately two-thirds of the protein-coding loci
(15,123) are captured in both haplotypes. Transposable elements
constitute
,30%
of
the
amphioxus
genome
assembly
(Supplementary Table 5) and belong to .500 families. On the basis
of their bulk contribution to the genome size, DNA transposons are
twice more abundant than retrotransposons.
Polymorphism
The distribution of observed local heterozygosity over short length
scales obeys a geometric distribution (Supplementary Fig. 1), con-
sistent with the prediction of the random mating model, as observed
in Ciona savignyi33, with a population mutation rate 4m Ne 5 0.0562,
where m is the per generation mutation rate and Ne is the effective
population size. High heterozygosity can, in principle, be explained
by: (1) a large effective population size maintained over many gen-
erations, (2) a high mutation rate per generation, or (3) the recent
mixing of previously isolated populations; in the latter case, a geo-
metric distribution of local heterozygosity would not be expected.
Assuming a typical metazoan mutation rate on the order of one to ten
substitutions per gigabase (Gb) per generation34,35, this observed
heterozygosity between alleles suggests a large but plausible effective
breeding population on the order of millions of individuals. The
observed heterozygosity shows correlations at short distances that
decay on scales greater than ,1 kb, indicating extensive recombina-
tion in the population (Supplementary Fig. 2). An analysis of the
ratio Ka/Ks of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions shows
evidence of purifying selection comparable to that found between
mammalian species (Supplementary Note 4). Insertion/deletion
polymorphisms are common, as found in other intra- and inter-
genome comparisons36 (Supplementary Fig. 3). Structural variation
between haplotypes also includes local inversions and tandem dupli-
cations (Supplementary Fig. 63).
Deuterostome relationships
With the draft amphioxus sequence in hand, we reconsidered the
relationshipswithinchordatesandbetweendeuterostomephyla(chor-
dates, echinoderms and hemichordates). The traditional placement of
lancelets as sister to vertebrates, with tunicates as the earliest diverging
chordate subphylum, has recently been questioned37,38. A preliminary
study39 using 146 gene loci (33,600 aligned amino acid positions) and
trace data from the present amphioxus genome project found support
for tunicates as the sister to vertebrates. This analysis, however, also
suggested (albeit with limited statistical support) that amphioxus is
more closely related to echinoderms than to tunicates or vertebrates,
which would render chordates a paraphyletic group. A second study
with a similarly sized set of genes but more diverse deuterostome taxa
supported the early branching of the cephalochordate lineage, but not
the close relationship of amphioxus and echinoderms40.
To address the controversial phylogenetic position of amphioxus,
we analysed a much larger set of 1,090 orthologous genes (see
Supplementary Note 5). Both bayesian and maximum likelihood
methods support the new chordate phylogeny38–40 in which cepha-
lochordates represent the most basal extant chordate lineage, with
tunicates (represented by both Ciona intestinalis and Oikopleura
dioica in our analysis) sister to vertebrates but with long branches
that indicate higher levels of amino acid substitution (Fig. 1).
Individual gene trees also lend support to this topology; genes sup-
porting tunicates as a sister group to vertebrates outnumber those
with amphioxus in this position by a 2:1 ratio. An analysis of intron
gain and loss in deuterostomes provides independent support for
amphioxus as the basal extant chordate subphylum (see below).

We group echinoderms (that is, the purple sea urchin) and hemi-
chordates (that is, the acorn worm) together (ambulacrarians)
as sister to a monophyletic chordate clade, as in ref. 41 but in contrast
to the suggestion of ref. 39. With the exception of the long-branched
tunicates, the maximum likelihood tree suggests a roughly constant
evolutionary rate of peptide change across the deuterostome tree,
although an excess of substitutions is found in the vertebrates relative
to the predictions of a simple molecular clock model.
Intron evolution
To assess the evolution of gene structure within the deuterostomes
and chordates, we compared the position and phase of amphioxus
introns to those in other animals. Amphioxus and human (along
with other vertebrates) share a large fraction of their introns (85%
in alignable regions), which match precisely in both position and
phase (Supplementary Note 6), as was also found in the sea anemone
Nematostella vectensis42. We found that the intron-rich gene struc-
tures of the eumetazoan ancestor were carried forward to the com-
mon chordate ancestor with relatively few gains or losses. The
tunicates C. intestinalis and Oikopleura dioica, however, share many
fewer introns with vertebrates43 or amphioxus.
Notably, intron presence or absence carries a significant (as mea-
sured by bootstrap values) phylogenetic signal, and bayesian analysis
of the associated character matrix supports the sister relationship
between tunicates and vertebrates (Supplementary Fig. 8; see
Methods). This is evidently due to shared gain or loss of introns along
the stem group leading to their common ancestor, which remarkably
is still detectable despite additional extensive secondary losses, and
modest gains, in the tunicate lineages. Thus, intron dynamics provide
independent support for the new chordate phylogeny.
Chordate gene families and novelties
Through comparison of the amphioxus gene set with those of other
animals, we identified 8,437 chordate gene families with members in
amphioxus and other chordates that each nominally represent the
modern descendants of a single gene in the last common chordate
ancestor (Supplementary Note 7). That ancestor certainly possessed
more genes than this number, but the others are inaccessible to us
now owing to subsequent sequence divergence and/or gene loss in the
living chordates. Through subsequent gene family expansions (by
means of both local and/or genome-wide duplications), these fam-
ilies account for 13,610 amphioxus genes, 13,401 human genes and
7,216 C. intestinalis genes. The markedly lower number of descendant
genes in C. intestinalis is largely due to gene loss44, with the present
analysis identifying 2,251 ancient chordate genes missing in this gen-
ome sequence. We found 8 apparent chordate stem gene losses (that
is, genes found in sea urchin and at least one of fly and sea anemone,
but not in vertebrates, amphioxus or C. intestinalis). A list of these
genes can be found in Supplementary Table 10.
We identified 239 apparent chordate gene novelties, that is, gene
families represented in amphioxus and at least one vertebrate or Ciona,
but without an obvious direct counterpart in non-chordate genomes.
These can be characterized42 as 137 families with no detectable
sequence similarity to non-chordate genes (type I novelties), 10 con-
taining one or more chordate-specific domains linked to pre-existing
metazoan domains (type II novelties), and 92 with chordate-specific
combinationsof pre-existingmetazoan domains(type III novelties;see
Supplementary Note 7). These gene families and others of special
interest to vertebrate biology are discussed in a separate paper45.
Amphioxus–vertebrate synteny
We have found extensive conservation of gene linkage on the scale of
whole chromosomes (macro-synteny) between the amphioxus gen-
ome and those of vertebrates (represented in our analysis by human,
chicken and teleost fish), but only limited conservation of local gene
order (micro-synteny). Through comparative analysis of these con-
served features, we reconstructed the gene complements of 17 linkage

segments of the chromosome, which enables a partitioning of the human
genome into 135 ancient segments. Supplementary File 5 contains an Oxford
grid tabulating the number of orthologues for each scaffold-segment pair.

groups (that is, proto-chromosomes) of the last common chordate
ancestor. When vertebrate genomes are analysed in the light of these
putative ancestral chordate chromosomes, a clear pattern of global
fourfold conserved macro-synteny is found, demonstrating that two
rounds of whole-genome duplication occurred on the vertebrate
stem.
Reconstruction of chordate linkage groups
To identify ancestral chordate linkage groups, we first noted that
many individual amphioxus scaffolds show conserved syntenic asso-
ciations with human chromosomes, reflecting conserved linkage
between the two genomes (Fig. 2; see also Oxford Grid in
Supplementary File 5; for simplicity, we emphasize the amphi-
oxus–human comparison in the main text, and include similar
results for chicken, stickleback and pufferfish as Supplementary
Information). Ninety-six scaffolds (out of 129 that possess 20 or
more independent vertebrate orthologues) have a significant
(P , 0.05, multiple test corrected) concentration of orthologues on
one or more human chromosome. In contrast, only 12 C. intestinalis
scaffolds (out of 134 that contain 20 or more vertebrate orthologues)
show significant synteny to human chromosomes.
Genes on individual amphioxus scaffolds have orthologues that
are generally concentrated in specific regions of vertebrate chromo-
somes (Fig. 2). Furthermore, multiple amphioxus scaffolds typically
exhibit hits to the same sets of human chromosomal regions. Within
each region, only limited conservation of gene order is observed
(Methods; Supplementary Note 8). This pattern of conserved syn-
teny shows that genome rearrangements have not erased the imprint
of the genome organization of the last common chordate ancestor
from the present human and amphioxus genomes. By using this
pattern, we identified 135 human chromosomal segments (listed in
Supplementary Table 14) that retain relict signals of the ancestral
chordate karyotype despite chromosomal rearrangements in each
lineage (Methods). These segments span a mean of 170 genes.

We exploited the pattern of amphioxus–human synteny to identify
17 ancient chordate linkage groups (CLGs) by clustering both
amphioxus scaffolds and human chromosomal segments according
to their pattern of hits in the other genome (Methods). The resulting
‘dot plot’ (Supplementary Fig. 64) shows that orthologues are con-
centrated in 17 distinct blocks. Within each block, gene order is
considerably scrambled. The natural interpretation of these blocks
is that each represents an ancient chordate linkage group that evolved
into a defined group of chromosomal segments in amphioxus,
human, chicken and teleost fish.
We tested our interpretation of the chordate linkage groups as
coherently evolving segments by using fluorescent in situ hybridiza-
tion (FISH) to demonstrate that 15 out of 16 scaffolds from CLG 15
localized to a single amphioxus chromosome. (FISH of the BACs
corresponding to the sixteenth scaffold were ambiguous; see
Supplementary Table 2.) Similarly, an independent study of amphi-
oxus cosmids containing NK group homeobox genes in CLG 7 found
that they localize to several distant regions of a single chromosome in
amphioxus27,28. These data support the claim that the 17 putative
ancestral chordate linkage groups have been maintained in modern
amphioxus as coherent chromosomal segments. The 19 pairs of
modern amphioxus chromosomes, however, imply at least (see
below) two subsequent fissions in the amphioxus lineage.
Within these segments, nearly 60% of the human genes that pos-
sess amphioxus orthologues participate in the conserved linkage
groups. This represents a lower bound, because short amphioxus
scaffolds are less likely to be assigned to CLGs. Conversely, 88% of
amphioxus gene models on scaffolds assigned to a CLG have their
human orthologue in a conserved position (that is, in the same CLG).
Remarkably, to the resolution of our analysis, some entire chromo-
somes (for example, human 18 and 21; chicken 7, 12, 15, 19, 21, 24
and 27) and chromosome arms (including human 5p) seem to have
maintained their integrity (with local scrambling and some gene gain
and loss) since the last common chordate ancestor. The CLGs defined
by comparing amphioxus and vertebrate genomes also provide a new
perspective on tunicate genome evolution, because it appears that C.
intestinalis chromosomes 10, 12 and 14 are each relicts of a single
CLG (11, 5 and 8, respectively), and other conserved linkages are
evident (Supplementary Fig. 14).
Quadruple conserved synteny
We can trace the evolution of chordate genomes through time using
two additional types of evidence. First, we can constrain the timing of
specific chromosome breaks by parsimony analysis of conserved
synteny across human, chicken and teleost genomes. Second, we
can use the presence (or absence) of paralogous gene pairs to identify
segments derived from the same chordate proto-chromosome by
duplication (or fission).
For example, five groups of human segments from chromosomes
1, 5, 9 and 19 cluster together in CLG 1 (Supplementary Note 8;
Supplementary Fig. 64). The segment pair 1.5/7 from chromosome
1 is related to each of the others by a significant concentration of
ancient gene paralogues (17 to 31 pairs, P , 1 3 10210), indicating
that it is related to the others by duplication. In contrast, only a single
pair of ancient paralogues relates segments 5.1 and 9.1/3, and ortho-
logues of the genes in these segments occur predominantly on the
same chromosomes of both pufferfish and stickleback. Thus, 5.1 and
9.1/3 were probably created by breakage of a single ancestral segment
of the genome of the bony vertebrate ancestor. If 5.1 and 9.1/3 are
virtually merged, then all remaining pairings of human segments
from CLG 1 show a significant excess of ancient paralogues, consist-
ent with amplification to four through two successive duplications.
Toobtainagenome-wideviewofthehistoryofchromosomalevolu-
tion on the vertebrate stem, we applied a similar analysis systematically
to the 17 CLGs by exhaustively evaluating all partitionings of human
genomesegments,andusinga parsimonycriterion toidentify themost
likely reconstruction. The most parsimonious partitionings of human
segments into paralogy groups is summarized in Supplementary Table
1, and is diagrammed in Fig. 3. This analysis shows that most of the
human genome (112 segments spanning 2.68 Gb, or 95% of the
euchromatic genome) was affected by large-scale duplication events
on the vertebrate stem before the bony vertebrate radiation (that is, the
teleost/tetrapod split), and that nearly all of the ancient chordate chro-
mosomes were quadruplicated (Supplementary Fig. 9).
This pattern of genome-wide quadruple conserved synteny15 defi-
nitively demonstrates the occurrence of two rounds of whole-genome
duplication (2R) and provides a comprehensive reconstruction of the
evolutionary origin of the human chromosomes (and those of other
jawed vertebrates) through these duplications on the vertebrate stem.
This characterization extends previous lines of evidence for whole-
genome duplication events based on comparative studies of specific
regions of interest across chordate genomes (for example, the Hox
cluster25 and the major histocompatibility complex region28,46) and
the analysis of vertebrate gene families (reviewed in ref. 29), as well as
the identification of paralogous segments and chromosomal relation-
ships within the human genome10,13,14,47. A manual, phylogeny-based
analysisofthefour scaffoldsmakinguptheNKhomeobox-containing
paralogon was in agreement with these results (Methods).
Timing of events on the vertebrate stem
Theamphioxus–human syntenyanalysispresentedhere demonstrates
that two rounds of whole-genome duplication occurred on the verte-
bratestem afterthedivergenceofcephalochordatesbutbeforethesplit
of teleosts and tetrapods. The next question is whether these two
genome-scale duplications happened in rapid succession or even
effectively simultaneously, or were separated in time15. We sought
to resolve the 2R events relative to the divergence of cartilaginous fish,
urochordates and jawless vertebrates (for example, lamprey).
Sample sequencing from the elephant shark Callorhynchus milii, for
example, demonstrates significant conserved macrosynteny between
cartilaginous fish and humans, because pairs of genes that are ,35–
40 kb apart in the elephant shark genome are also linked on the human
genome48. These links occur predominantly within the human seg-
ments defined above, indicating that the orthologous chromosome
segments are also found in the elephant shark genome (Supple-
mentaryNote9).Furthermore,previousanalysisofphylogenetic topol-
ogies dated all duplications before the split between cartilaginous and
bony vertebrates49. Therefore, 2R occurred before this split48. Similarly,
the preservation of several CLGs as intact single chromosomes in C.
intestinalis (Supplementary Fig. 14) implies that both rounds of
duplication occurred after the divergence of the urochordate lineage.
Sequencing of the repeat-rich lamprey genome has not generated
enough long scaffolds to permit large-scale analysis of synteny50. To
infer the timing of 2R relative to the divergence of the lamprey lineage,
we generated a set of ,50,000 ESTs from the sea lamprey Petromyzon
marinus (Supplementary Note 3) and analysed the phylogenetic topo-
logy of 358 gene families that include pairs of synteny-confirmed
human paralogues produced during 2R. The results are summarized

in Table 1, along with a parallel analysis using sea squirt and pufferfish
for comparison. We find that ,58% of the resolved four-gene phy-
logenies placethelampreygene closertooneofthehumanparalogues;
this is similar to the results of ref. 51 but analyses a tenfold larger set of
gene families (Supplementary Fig. 2). This result is clearly distinct
from that expected if the lamprey lineage diverged either much before
(as for sea squirt) or after (as for pufferfish) 2R. The remaining scen-
arios are either that the jawed vertebrate and lamprey lineages
diverged in the period between two well-separated whole-genome
duplications, or that one, or both, of the 2R whole-genome events
occurred nearly coincident with the lamprey lineage divergence. The
time interval that distinguishes ‘nearly coincident’ from ‘well-sepa-
rated’ is determined by the process of rediploidization, during which
most gene duplicates are lost and the sequences of the surviving para-
logues diverge9,15.
Karyotypic changes in the vertebrate and tunicate lineages
From the 17 ancestral chordate linkage groups, 2R nominally pro-
duced 17 3 4 5 68 proto-vertebrate segments, although this naive
inference assumes that, first, all duplicated segments were retained
and, second, no fusions, fissions or additional segmental duplications
occurred during 2R. Some 2R-produced segments, however, are con-
sistently linked in contemporary bony vertebrate genomes (for
example, 12b and 1d, which co-occur on human chromosome 1,
chicken chromosome 8 and stickleback linkage groups III and
VIII), indicating a fusion before the bony vertebrate (osteichthyan)
ancestor. We found evidence for at least 20 such fusions
(Supplementary Note 8). Allowing for a range of nearly parsimo-
nious reconstructions of 2R, we estimate that the bony vertebrate
ancestor had between 37 and 49 chromosomes. Additional fusions
on the teleost stem reduced this number to 12 (refs 52–56) before the
teleost-specific genome duplication. On the tetrapod stem, the
chicken and human genomes share 4 fusions of bony vertebrate seg-
ments, suggesting 33–45 chromosomes. These are consistent with
recent estimates based on intra-vertebrate comparisons47,52–56.
Ancient developmental gene linkages
The amphioxus genome has also retained ancient local gene linkages
(micro-synteny) in addition to conserved macro-synteny. In some
cases, local linkages are even older than the chordates, and date back
to the bilaterian ancestor or earlier. As an example, we considered
gene families that expanded by tandem duplication early in animal
evolution, specifically, the Antennapedia (ANTP) and Paired (PRD)
classes of homeobox genes and the Wnt gene family. We examined
how frequently these genes are still neighbours in the amphioxus
genome, and discovered five new examples of ancient pairs or clusters
of ANTP or PRD genes: (1) Otx and goosecoid, (2) Mnx and ro, (3)
Nkx2-1 and Nkx2-2, (4) Nkx6, Nkx7, Lbx and Tlx, and (5) En, Nedxa,
Nedxb and Dll (Supplementary Table 3). These gene pairs or clusters
(along with the well-known Hox, ParaHox and NK linkages) origi-
nated by tandem duplication before the divergence of bilaterians, yet
their tight linkage has not been disrupted by genome rearrangement.
The Nkx2-1/Nkx2-2 gene pair has been retained in vertebrates (and is
duplicated), but in every other example the tight linkage (clustering)
has been lost in the human genome. None of the five newly described
examples are retained in the Drosophila melanogaster genome. The
situation in the Wnt gene family is a little different, because both
amphioxus and Drosophila have retained tight linkages that have been
disrupted in the human lineage owing to genome duplication fol-
lowed by differential gene loss (Fig. 4). These results underscore the
fact that the amphioxus genome has undergone less genomic
rearrangement than the human and other vertebrate genomes since
their shared ancestor more than half a billion years ago.
Impact of whole-genome duplications
How many duplicate genes survive in modern vertebrate genomes
from the two genome-wide events? Twenty-five per cent (2,131) of
the ancestral chordate gene families (out of the 8,437 indicated
above) have two or more ancient vertebrate paralogues (‘ohnolo-
gues’) that were evidently produced by ancient gene duplication(s)
after the divergence of amphioxus (see also Supplementary Fig. 3). Of
these, 1,489 (70%) are embedded within paralogous segments from
our reconstruction of 2R, as portrayed in Fig. 3, and were plausibly
created through 2R. These retention rates for 2R-duplicated genes are
comparable to other estimates based on large-scale gene phy-
logenies10,14,57,58. Similar retention rates were found for the ,350-
million-year-old teleost-fish-specific duplication55,59–61 and were
estimated for the ,40-million-year-old genome duplication found
in the frog Xenopus laevis62.
Gene duplicates from 2R that have been retained in modern gen-
omes are significantly enriched for functions associated with signal
transduction, transcriptional regulation, neuronal activities and
developmental processes (Supplementary Table 18, Methods). For
example, genes implicated in signal transduction are more than twice
as likely to be retained in two or more copies from 2R compared to
the overall retention rate. These results are consistent with the hypo-
thesis that paralogues created by whole-genome duplication were
recruited for roles in the development of novel features of vertebrate
biology, and with similar biased retention in teleost fishes61. Whole-
genome duplications, however, may have allowed entire molecular
pathways to be duplicated and sub-functionalized coincidently
(reviewed in ref. 63). Whereas similar numbers of gene duplicates
are found in amphioxus relative to the chordate ancestor, different
gene classes have been expanded, and the mechanism of gene
duplication is different (Supplementary Note 7).
Conserved non-coding sequences
Inspired by the extensive conserved synteny between amphioxus and
vertebrates, we searched for conserved non-coding sequences that
might reflect ancient chordate cis-regulatory elements. Genome-scale
comparisons between mammals and teleost fish have revealed up to
3,100 conserved non-coding sequences, most of which function as
tissue-specific enhancers64,65. At greater phylogenetic distances, no

and human genomes (Supplementary Note 10), 77 putative chordate
conserved non-coding elements were identified (.60% identity over
.50 bp), after excluding transcribed or repetitive sequences and
requiring conservation in at least one other vertebrate. Of these, 16

genes are also clustered in Drosophila (not shown), although Wnt3 has been
lost, as inferred from its presence in cnidarians. The human orthologues are
on four chromosomes, and show disruption of gene clustering through
duplication followed by gene loss. Linkages of Hox clusters to three of the
human loci gives additional support for the large-scale duplication events
involved. The three clusters that are linked to Hox clusters (as well as the
four Hox clusters) fall in chromosome segments grouped in CLG 16, as does
the Hox-bearing amphioxus scaffold. Genes drawn as boxes above the

overlap with or are immediately adjacent to the 39 or 59 untranslated
regions (UTRs) of human genes, and are probably conserved UTR
elements. Four are adjacent to exons and probably represent con-
served splicing enhancers. A single conserved noncoding element
overlapped a highly conserved microRNA gene (mir-10b adjacent
to the human HOXD4 gene). The remaining 56 elements are of
unknown function, but can be tested experimentally for enhancer
activity45.
Conclusions
The amphioxus sequence reveals key features of the genome of the
last common ancestor of all chordates through comparison with the
genomes of other animals. This ancestor probably lived before the
Cambrian period, and gave rise to the chordate lineage that is repre-
sented today by modern cephalochordates such as amphioxus, as well
as urochordates and vertebrates. Of the living lineages, the cephalo-
chordates diverged first, before the split between the morphologically
diverse urochordates and vertebrates. To a remarkable extent, the
amphioxus genome appears to be a good surrogate for the ancestral
chordate genome with respect to gene content, exon–intron gene
structure and even chromosomal organization. The sequences of
model ascidians with small genomes are by comparison simplified
by gene loss, intron loss and genome rearrangement. Remarkably,
modest levels of non-coding sequence have been conserved between
amphioxus and human—the oldest conserved non-coding regions
yet detected through direct sequence alignment—and may provide a
tantalizing glimpse of the gene regulatory systems of the last common
chordate ancestor.
Extensive conserved synteny between the genomes of amphioxus
and various vertebrates lends unprecedented clarity and coherence to
the history of genome-scale events in vertebrate evolution. The
human and other jawed vertebrate genomes show widespread quad-
ruple-conserved synteny relative to the amphioxus sequence, which
extends earlier regional studies and provides a unified explanation
for paralogous chromosomal regions in vertebrates. Our analysis
thus provides conclusive evidence for two rounds of complete gen-
ome duplication on the jawed vertebrate stem. These genome dupli-
cations occurred after the divergence of urochordates but before the
split between cartilaginous fish and bony vertebrates. The jawless
vertebrates (for example, lamprey and hagfish) represent the only
other chordate lineages that survive from this period, and at least
the lamprey appears to have diverged between the two rounds of
duplication, although the data still allow for an octoploid population
as the progenitor of the jawless and jawed vertebrates. The detailed
mechanism of these events—in particular, whether they occurred by
allo- and/or auto-tetraploidizations, how closely spaced in time they
were, and the precise nature of the rediploidization process—remain
unknown. Although it is tempting to relate the genome duplications
to specific morphological radiations in vertebrate evolution, the fos-
sil record reflects a relatively steady diversification rather than a
dramatic discontinuity of stem-group vertebrate forms67.
The genomic features that are associated with organismal complex-
ity, if such generic features exist at all, remain unknown68. It is tempt-
ing to speculate, however, that the creation of the ancestral jawed
vertebrate genome by two rounds of genome duplication was a form-
ative event in the early history of vertebrates that provided genomic
flexibility through the duplication of coding and cis-regulatory
sequences for the emergence of familiar developmental, morpho-
logical and physiological novelties such as chondrogenic and skeleto-
genic neural crest cells, the sclerotome (vertebral) compartment of the
somites, elaborate hindbrain patterning, finely graded nervous system
organization, and the elaborated endocrine system of vertebrates.
Indeed, we find that genes involved in developmental signalling and
gene regulation are significantly more likely to be retained in multiple
copies in living species than genes overall, suggesting that diversified
developmental regulation is correlated with the evolution of verte-
brate novelties. This begs the question, dating back to Ohno, of how
such duplicated genes became integrated into the biochemical and
genetic networks of vertebrates. In a separate paper45, we examine
vertebrate biology in the light of the amphioxus genome data and
the genome-scale duplication events on the vertebrate stem.
METHODS SUMMARY
Genome sequencing, assembly and annotation. High-quality sequence Sanger
reads (7.3 million) were generated and assembled using JAZZ69. Protein-coding
genes were annotated using EST, homology and ab initio methods as described
previously42,70.
Deuterostome relationships. Orthologous gene alignments were created using
ClustalW71 and Gblocks72, and analysed with bayesian and maximum likelihood
methods.
Intron evolution. The presence and absence of an intron at each of 5,337 ortho-
logous coding positions was treated as a binary character in parsimony and
bayesian analyses.
Construction of chordate linkage groups. Human chromosome segments and
amphioxus scaffolds were clustered by orthologue distribution profile. The null
hypothesis (orthologous genes randomly distributed across the two genomes)
was evaluated using Fisher’s exact test, with a Bonferroni correction for the total
number of pairwise tests.
Decomposition of CLGs into independent products of duplication. The most
parsimonious partitioning of the human chromosomal segments assigned to the
CLG was obtained using a scoring system that included shared ohnologues and
position in the multi-species synteny comparison.
NK quadruple conserved synteny. In addition to the genome-wide synteny
analysis, a detailed manual curation was carried out on four v1 scaffolds (56,
124, 185 and 294) that make up the NK homeobox cluster in amphioxus. The 82
amphioxus genes correspond to 111 human genes enriched on chromosomes 4,
5, 8 and 10 (chi-squared test, P = 0.001), in agreement with the genome-wide
analysis of CLG 7 (Supplementary Note 11).
Ancient developmental gene linkages. Orthology of homeodomain- and Wnt-
containing genes was assigned from phylogenetic tree reconstruction using
neighbour-joining and maximum likelihood approaches, supported by high
bootstrap values.

METHODS
Genome sequence and assembly. High-quality sequence Sanger reads (7.3 mil-
lion) were generated and assembled using JAZZ69,73. See Supplementary Note 2
for details of the genomic libraries, assembly methods and validation.
Annotation of protein-coding genes. Protein-coding genes were annotated by
the JGI annotation pipeline as previously described42,70. See Supplementary Note
3 for a description of amphioxus-specific details. Gene models representing
allelic pairs were identified using a combination of similarity of predicted pep-
tide sequence and gene neighbourhood context (Supplementary Note 3).
Deuterostome relationships. Sets of orthologous genes were collected by group-
ing together mutual-best BLAST74 hits between N. vectensis (sea anemone) and
gene sets from other published deuterostome genomes plus expressed sequence
data from the acorn worm Saccoglossus kowalevskii75 and the sea lamprey P.
marinus (Supplementary Note 5). Individual multiple alignments were created
with CLUSTALW71, were manually reviewed, trimmed with Gblocks72, and con-
catenated. Orthologue sets (364) had representation from all genomes (align-
ment 1), and 1,090 had up to one missing (alignment 2). The alignments were
analysed by bayesian and maximum likelihood methods, respectively, using
MrBayes76,77 and PHYML78. Supplementary Note 5 contains more details of
the data sources, data compilation and analysis.
Intron evolution. A collection of 5,337 orthologous well-aligned coding
sequence positions that contain an intron in at least one genome was analysed
by weighted parsimony analysis with PAUP79 and Bayesian analysis with
MrBayes76,77 (Supplementary Note 6).
Chordate gene families. Using predicted proteomes for human, chicken, stickle-
back, pufferfish, sea squirt, amphioxus, sea urchin, fruitfly and sea anemone
(Supplementary Note 5), families (‘clusters’) of orthologous genes were con-
structed to represent the ancestral gene complements of the tetrapod, teleost,
jawed vertebrate, ‘olfactores’ (that is, vertebrates plus urochordates), chordate
and deuterostome ancestors, as described previously42, with modifications
described in Supplementary Note 7.
Chromosome segmentation. The human, chicken and stickleback chromo-
somes were segmented iteratively by comparison to one another and to the
scaffolds of the Fugu genome assembly. See Supplementary Note 8 for complete
details.
Construction of chordate linkage groups. For whole-genome synteny analysis,
orthology between genomes was based on c-score (BLAST score/best BLAST
score) clustering as previously described42, with a c-score threshold of 0.75 when
comparing human and amphioxus, and 0.95 when comparing human to other
vertebrates. To define initial CLGs (Supplementary Fig. 64), human chro-
mosome segments and amphioxus scaffolds were clustered using the same
method as for chromosome segmentation, with a correlation threshold of
0.25. Statistical significance of orthologue concentration between regions of
one genome and another was computed with Fisher’s exact test with a
Bonferroni
correction
for
the
total
number
of
pairwise
tests
(see
Supplementary Note 8 for additional details).
Fluorescent in situ hybridization. Chromosome preparation was performed as
described previously80 with modifications described in Supplementary Note 8.
Multi-species synteny comparison. The clustering protocol described above for
human–amphioxus was repeated for human–Fugu, human–stickleback and
human–Nematostella to define clusters of scaffolds or chromosome segments
(a ‘cluster set’) for each genome based on comparison to human. All pairs of
human chromosome segments were compared to each cluster set, and for each
set were classified as having conserved synteny to the same cluster (coded with
‘1’), having conserved synteny (only) to different clusters (coded with ‘0’), or
having indeterminate conserved synteny if one or both human segments lack
significant conserved synteny to any cluster in the cluster set (coded with ‘?’). The
complete results are represented as a colour-coded matrix in Supplementary Fig.
9.
Identification of ohnologues. Operationally, we define a pair of human genes as
ohnologues (paralogues descendent from 2R in vertebrate evolution) if they are
found in the same chordate gene family (excluding large gene families with more
than ten members) and are ancient paralogues differing by more than 0.2 trans-
versions per site at synonymous positions. (We use transversions rather than the
more common total substitutions because transversions occur more slowly and
therefore show less saturation at the timescales of interest.)
Decomposition of CLGs into independent products of duplication. For each
CLG, all partitionings of the human chromosomal segments assigned to the CLG
were tabulated. Each partitioning was assigned a score as follows: 11 for each
pair of segments from different partitions with a significant number of predicted
ohnologues between them; 21 for each pair of segments from different parti-
tions without a significant number of ohnologues between them. Among the
partitionings with the maximum score, ties were broken by using the multi-
species synteny comparison results: a score of 1e for each pair of segments from
different partitions coloured red or orange, and a score of 2e for each pair of
segments from different partitions where multi-synteny comparison indicates
the two segments were one segment in the jawed vertebrate ancestor (coloured
blue or purple in Supplementary Figs 9 and 10), where epsilon is a positive
number much less than 1.
Timing of genome duplications. Genes from pufferfish, lamprey and sea squirt
(‘X’) were aligned to pairs of human ohnologues (‘Hs1’ and ‘Hs2’) and the
orthologous amphioxus gene; phylogenetic position was considered resolved if
it has at least 50% maximum likelihood bootstrap support (Supplementary Note
9 and Supplementary Fig. 11).
Ancient developmental gene linkages. Genes were identified by tBLASTn
against version 1.0 of the B. floridae genome assembly with vertebrate and inver-
tebrate homeodomain and Wnt sequences. Orthology was assigned from phylo-
genetic tree reconstruction using neighbour-joining and maximum likelihood
approaches. Support for nodes was assessed by bootstrapping; all gene families
were recovered with high support. Human data from Ensembl release 47 were
used. Supplementary Table 3 lists the genes and gene models examined.
Functional categorization of retained duplicate genes. PANTHER functional
annotations were mapped to inferred ancestral chordate genes, and subsets of
these genes were analysed for enrichment in functional categories by methods
previously described for the analysis of ancestral eumetazoan genes42. Because
functional annotations overlap, the category of ‘developmental processes’ is itself
dominated by genes associated with signal transduction and transcriptional
regulation.

coding element and expression analysis, see Supplementary Note 10.
