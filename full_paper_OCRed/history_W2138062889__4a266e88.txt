Abstract 
The mitochondrial (mt) genome is the most extensively studied genomic system in insects, outnumbering 
nuclear genomes by tenfold, and representing all orders versus very few.  Phylogenomic analysis methods 
have been extensively tested, identifying compositional bias and rate variation, both within and between 
lineages, as the principle issues confronting accurate analyses.  Major studies at both inter- and 
intraordinal levels have contributed to our understanding of phylogenetic relationships within many 
groups.  Genome rearrangements are an additional data type data for defining relationships, with 
rearrangement synapomorphies identified across multiple orders and at many different taxonomic levels.  
Hymenoptera and Psocodea have greatly elevated rates of rearrangement offering both opportunities and 
pitfalls for identifying rearrangement synapomorphies in each group.  Finally, insects include model 
systems for studying “aberrant” mt genomes, including truncated tRNAs and multichromosomal 
genomes.  Greater integration of nuclear and mt genomic studies, is the challenge for furthering our 
understanding of insect genomic evolution.

Introduction 
Due to the extensive use of its individual genes across a wide range of studies, the mitochondrial (mt) 
genome (= mitogenome or mtgenome) has had an outsized impact on entomological genetics.  Initially mt 
genes were widely used due to the limited number of alternative, nuclear-encoded genes which could be 
amplified with reliable, near-universal primers across insects (with the exception of the ribosomal RNA 
genes) (31).  Indeed, despite several large scale efforts (e.g. 82, 94, 128), the development of reliable 
protocols for sequencing nuclear protein coding genes in insects has been so slow that mt genes still 
predominate in insect molecular systematic datasets.  The recent focus of the DNA-barcoding community 
on the mt encoded cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (= cox1, CO1) as a near-exclusive data source for 
species identification and delimitation (57) has further increased the rate of mt gene sequencing (93).  
Collectively these forces have resulted in such a flood of data that mt genes are now by orders of 
magnitude the most common insect sequences on Genbank and understanding the particular dynamics of 
mt genetic evolution is vital to the appropriate use of this enormous data resource.   
 
Parallel to these general developments, has been a rapid increase in available mt genome data, both for 
animals in general and insects in particular.  At its simplest level the sequencing of whole mt genomes 
can inform subsequent studies utilising individual mt genes such as by improving primer design or 
allowing an expanded choice of target genes (e.g. 46).  Indeed, such expansion of available genetic 
resources for a particular species is the most commonly invoked reason for undertaking mt genome 
sequencing, if the “Introduction” sections of many papers are to be believed.  There are however also 
many studies where mt genome sequencing itself is the “end” goal of the study rather than merely a 
“means” to some other data set.  Whole mt genomes have been used for the same wide array of research 
goals as individual mt genes including molecular systematics (at both deep and shallow taxonomic 
scales), population genetics/phylogeography (e.g. 76), diagnostics (e.g. 87), and molecular evolutionary 
studies (e.g. 30, 100, 104).  In addition, whole genome sequencing also allows the study of comparative

----- Page 4 (native) -----
and evolutionary genomics questions such as the frequency and type of gene rearrangements (e.g. 24, 45), 
evolution of genome size etc (e.g. 106).  The small size of the mt genome makes it a practical genome 
study system in insects which nuclear genome sequencing will not equal in the near future.   
 
Since the first insect mt genome was published in 1985, a Drosophila appropriately or inevitably 
depending on your perspective (32), there has been a rapid accumulation of sequenced insect genomes, 
with representatives of all orders now available (Figure 1).  This review will thus focus on the evolving 
methods for analysing insect mt genomes and empirical findings drawn from this data source.  I will not 
explicitly address studies of single mt genes from insects as this vast field has been covered previously 
from several perspectives.  The insights into mt evolution obtained from whole mt genomes, however, are 
valuable for the reliable use of single mt genes rather than uniquely applicable to whole genomes.   
 
Mitochondrial Genomes of Arthropods & Insects 
The mitochondrial genomics of arthropods has been extensively studied; with the complete genomes of 
over 600 species available, arthropods are second only to the vertebrates as the most studied metazoan 
phylum.  Taxonomic coverage within arthropods is also now quite comprehensive, with multiple 
representatives sequenced for each of the four extant subphyla, 14 of the 15 classes and 65 of the 103 
orders.  Of the arthropods, insects are by far the most extensively studied group, representing 
approximately 80% of the arthropod mt genomes which have been sequenced.  Insects are also the most 
comprehensively sampled at higher taxonomic levels; mt genomes are available from each of the 28 
recognised orders (Table 1).  Within most orders, mt genomes representing each of the major subordinal 
lineages are now available and representation at the family level is steadily improving.  Data has 
accumulated rapidly with improved methods of PCR (reviewed in 18) and pyrosequencing (118).  There 
are still a modest number of groups where representation is seriously deficient relative to diversity 
including dragonflies (Odonata), mt genomes for just 4 of 32 families, stoneflies (Plecoptera) 1 of 17, 
scale insects (Coccoidea) 0 of 20, and ditrysian moths (Lepidoptera) 17 of 109.  However, there is now 
more than sufficient mt genome data available from insects to reliably draw conclusions about patterns 
and trends in the genomic evolution of this group.   
 
The insect mt genome is a compact circular molecule typically 15-18 kb in size.  It encodes 37 genes; 13 
protein-coding genes (PCGs) that encode subunits from 4 of the 5 mt electron-transport chain complexes 
plus 2 ribosomal (rRNA) and 22 transfer (tRNA) RNA genes involved in the translation of the PCGs.  
This set of 37 genes is conserved across bilaterian metazoans, with only a few exceptions (e.g. loss of a 
small number of genes in some derived groups) (12).  In addition to the genes there are a variety of non-
coding structural features of the genome of which the largest is termed the “control region” as it contains 
both an origin of replication and transcription.  The arrangement of the genes within the genome is also 
highly conserved.  An ancestral arrangement of the 15 PCG and rRNA genes can be identified for the 
Bilateria (85), which is only slightly modified in the ancestral ecdysozoan and arthropod (16).  The 
ancestral insect mt genome (Figure 2) differs from the ancestral arthropod only by the location of one 
tRNA gene (15).  While significant departures from the ancestral insect mt genomes in terms of structure, 
gene content and gene arrangement have been recorded within insects, it is clear from the genomes now 
available that these “exceptions” are only found in highly derived portions of the insect tree of life.

Insect Mitochondrial Phylogenomics 
By far the most widespread use of insect mt genomes is as a source of sequence data for phylogenetic 
analysis (what I term phylogenomics).  To date, over 100 publications report insect phylogenies built 
using mt genome data and while too many are methodologically naive (e.g. use of a single, seemingly 
arbitrary inference method, partitioning approach, no discussion of potential biases etc), others 
extensively test the effectiveness of different analytical approaches.  The potential biases in phylogenies 
based on insect mt genomes have thus been fairly well investigated and while none are unique to mt 
genomes, several are more extreme than occur in nuclear-gene phylogenetics.  Collectively, these studies 
have addressed a wide range of taxonomic levels from single-species phylogeographic studies (e.g. 76), 
through intraordinal (4), to interordinal (122) or interclass relationships (19, 86).  Representatives of 
almost all insect orders have been included in mt phylogenomics studies and there is substantial variation 
between orders in the intensity of analytical biases.  Insect mt phylogenomics is not trivial, however, 
more than enough studies have now been conducted to clearly identify trends for the reliable use of this 
data source.   
 
Decisions about data inclusion affect phylogenomics studies more acutely than single- or multilocus 
phylogenetics.  The non-coding control region is excluded from almost all studies except 
phylogeographic studies of a single species (e.g. 46, 76).  The remaining 37 genes have been used to 
varying degrees across previous studies.  Some early analyses (e.g. 64, 86) determined the inclusion or 
exclusion of individual PCGs on the basis of the ratios of gaps and invariant sites.  These approaches, 
however, involve arbitrary cut offs (e.g. 10% gaps good, 10.1% gaps bad) and are highly dependent on 
taxon selection, as the inclusion of even a single highly divergent species could result in the rejection of 
all genes (19).  In practise almost all studies have included all 13 PCGs, as they comprise ≈ 75% of the 
genic sequence, whereas the inclusion of the 2 rRNA (≈ 15%) and 22 tRNA (≈ 10%) genes has been more 
variable.  The inclusion of these genes has, however, been shown to be beneficial each time it has been 
tested resulting in at least improved nodal confidence (e.g. in Diptera, 21) to at best stabilising otherwise 
highly variable backbone relationships (e.g. in Neuropteroids, 23).  In no instances have they resulted in 
artefactual relationships being supported when analyses of the PCGs alone were more congruent with 
independent phylogenetic estimates.  There is no justification for the exclusion of rRNA or tRNA genes 
from insect phylogenomics analyses.   
 
A related issue is the exclusion of portions of genes on either an arbitrary (e.g. third codons of PCGs, loop 
regions of RNAs) or an algorithmic basis (e.g. by software such as GBlocks, 29).  Depending on the 
taxonomic scale of the analysis the inclusion of third codon positions may result in either serious artefacts 
(e.g. within Dictyoptera, 25) or are the source of the majority of the phylogenetic signal (e.g. within 
calliphorid blowflies, 87).  Third codon positions are most strongly affected by nucleotide compositional 
bias and skew (see below) and the removal of third codons may be the only method of effectively dealing 
with these issues.  Given the variable in their phylogenetic performance it should be standard practice to 
assess the effect on topology and nodal support of inclusion vs. exclusion of third codons by replicate 
analyses within each study.

Insect mt phylogenomics has largely been spared the tedious debates about alignment methodologies 
which dogged other areas of deep-level insect phylogenetics over the past two decades (e.g. 64, 115).  
Alignment of PCGs has been largely a twostep process: initial alignment of amino-acid sequences, 
followed by translation back to DNA sequences so as to maintain coding frames.  Within many orders 
PCG alignments are almost trivial as there is very limited gene length variability.  RNA genes can be 
aligned with reference to secondary structures or by standard pair-wise alignment methods, however, on 
the one occasion it has been tested (23) it had no real effect on topology or nodal support.  Again for most 
intraordinal analyses, RNA alignments approach the trivial with indels readily identifiable.  Historically 
inconsistent annotation standards initially created much of the observed variability in gene length, 
however this is declining as multiple genomes are sequenced for each order.  Variable alignment 
standards are not a major issue within insect mt phylogenomics.   
 
Many early analyses produced clearly artefactual results that were attributed to “long-branch like effects” 
which in this instance typically meant compositional biases and/or model misspecification.  Mt genomes 
in general, and insect ones in particular, display strong base compositional bias (A+T ≠ G+C) (100).  The 
compositional bias of insect mt genomes varies significantly both across (e.g. A+T% ranges from 64% in 
termites to 86.7% in bees; 25, 109) and within orders (e.g. beetles, 65 – 78 A+T%; 108).  Such 
compositional heterogeneity is a violation of the stationarity assumption of the widely used, time-
homogenous models of nucleotide substitution (GTR, HKY85, F81 etc) (50).  Including taxa that have 
independently evolved significantly biased nucleotide compositions in a single analysis can result in the 
artefactual groups (48).  For example, within beetles both subordinal and superfamily relationships were 
incorrectly recovered using standard analytical methods which didn’t correct for base compositional 
heterogeneity (108, 110).  In other instances a directional shift in compositional bias appears to be a 
derived feature of the clade, for instance in termites A+T% is 5.5% lower than their nearest living relative 
Cryptocercus, and 6.3% lower than other dictyopterans, reinforcing the monophyly of the group (25).  
While specialised tree-inference software has been developed which accounts for compositional 
heterogeneity (reviewed in 108), these methods are not widely adopted.  If artefactual relationships due to 
this effect are suspected, taxon exclusion, to create a more compositionally homogenous dataset, should 
be attempted to investigate the sensitivity of recovered relationships.   
 
A second violation of model assumptions found in mt genomes is among-site rate heterogeneity (ASRH), 
variation in substitution rate between different genes or between codon positions within a gene (136).  
The asymmetrical replication of mt genomes predisposes them to this type of heterogeneity (33).  Each 
strand of the mt genome is replicated separately, with one origin of replication located in the control 
region and a second approx. 11kb downstream.  This means that the second, or lagging, strand spends up 
to two thirds of the replication cycle in a single-stranded state and is more susceptible to mutations.  
Asymmetrical replication results in strand-specific nucleotide skew, one A+C rich, the other T+G rich, 
and the genes encoded on different strands will thus differ in their nucleotide frequencies (96).  A 
compounding factor is that the direction of replication, and thus the direction of nucleotide-skew, has 
been reversed in several lineages (56).  Gene rearrangements, especially inversions can also result in a 
taxon specific departure from average nucleotide skew in the affected gene.  Adequate data partitioning 
(see below) or the use of a γ-parameter can usually compensate for ASRH, but other methods that have 
been applied include data transformations such as RY-coding or analysis of translated amino acids.  One 
advantage of analysing amino-acid sequences is that mitochondria specific substitution models have 
recently been calculated for various taxonomic groups including animals (mtZoa, 98) and arthropods

----- Page 7 (native) -----
(mtArt, 1).  Reductive coding, however, results in a significant loss of signal and nodal support (first 
noted by Cameron et al. 2006 but seen in many subsequent studies).  Analysis of PCGs as amino acids 
may be necessary for inferring interclass or interphylum relationships (e.g. 99), however, for analyses 
within insects it just eliminates valuable phylogenetic signal.   
 
Data partitioning, and the ability to apply specific models to different partitions, is ideal for analysing 
genomes shaped by multiple mutational forces such as the mitochondria.  The majority of studies have 
used relatively intuitive partitioning schemes such as by gene type (PCG, rRNA, tRNA), by gene, by 
codon position, by codon and gene, or by the strand on which the gene is encoded.  Different partitioning 
strategies can each result in strong nodal support for conflicting topologies at the interordinal level but 
had no effect at intraordinal levels (21, 44, 47), suggesting that partitioning is most significant at deeper 
phylogenetic levels.  Recently, methods for simultaneously choosing partitioning schemes and 
substitution models have been developed (69).  Their application to insect mt genomes suggested optimal 
partitions wildly at odds with traditionally used partitions (72).  In this dataset, acridomorph 
grasshoppers, different partitioning schemes resulted in modest topological differences, however, in the 
absence of independent phylogenetic data it was not possible to determine which partitioning schemes 
produced the most corroborated topology.  The effect of data partitioning needs to be investigated over a 
wider range of taxonomic scales and in multiple orders before its significance can be fully evaluated but 
available evidence suggests that it is an underappreciated source of variability between different insect mt 
phylogenomics studies.   
 
The empirical findings produced over the last decade of insect mt phylogenomics are impressively broad.  
Interordinal relationships have been explicitly addressed in several analyses.  Early studies with very 
broad ordinal resentation have produced clearly incorrect results e.g. non-monophyletic Holometabola, 
Plecoptera+Diptera, Strepsiptera within Holometabola (28), however subsequent more targeted analyses 
resulted in much better corroborated results.  The monophyly of the Dicondylia and Pterygota are 
consistently recovered (27, 91, 122, 138, 139).  The “Palaeoptera problem” is as alive with mt genome 
data as it is with nuclear sequence or transcriptome data (see review in 137), with various studies 
supporting Metapterygota (91, 138), Chiastomyaria (122) or a likely artefactual grouping of 
Ephemeroptera+Plecoptera within Neoptera (75, 139).  Relationships inferred within the Polyneoptera 
have been largely congruent with those inferred by nuclear ribosomal (e.g. 116) or protein-coding (61) 
genes, however all studies are missing one or more orders limiting direct comparisons.  Four subclades 
are consistently recovered within Polyneoptera by both nuclear and mt genomic datasets, Orthoptera (47), 
Dictyoptera (25, 131), Dermaptera+Plecoptera (122) and Grylloblattodea + Embioptera + 
Mantophasmatodea + Phasmatodea (GEMP) (20, 67, 122), although relationships between these four 
groups in not consistent between studies.  Zoraptera has yet to be included in an mt phylogenomic study.  
Relationships within each of these polyneopteran subclades are also relatively uncontroversial with the 
exception of the last, GEMP.  Mt genome data consistently groups Mantophasmatodea as the sister of 
Phasmatodea, even when, as in (67), Embioptera is grouped within Phasmatodea (as sister to 
Verophasmatodea).  In contrast nuclear genes support Grylloblattodea+Mantophasmatodea (61, 116), 
however this relationship is sensitive to both alignment (66) and taxon selection (37).  Both possible 
relationships for Mantophasmatodea are supported by different morphological traits, yet no resolution of 
the conflicting data sets has been made.

----- Page 8 (native) -----
In contrast to the the Polyneoptera, there has been comparatively limited mt phylogenomics studies into 
interordinal relationships within the Holometabola.  Many of the intraordinal studies (discussed below) of 
Holometabola have also commented on interordinal relationships inferred as a by-product of outgroup 
selection, however, these studies omit too many orders to be of much comparative value.  The few 
genuine interordinal studies within the Holometabola have focused on the Neuropterida, whose 
relationships are strongly affected by analytical biases (23).  A sister-group relationship between 
Neuroptera and Megaloptera was recovered by both (23) and (123), contrary to recent multigene (126, 
129) and morphological (11) phylogenies.  Mt phylogenomics also supported the monophyly of 
Megaloptera (123) which was rendered paraphyletic by Raphidioptera in recent studies (11, 129).  The 
position of Raphidioptera is affected by rate variation and groups as the sister to all Holometabola except 
Hymenoptera in analyses which do not compensate (23, 123).  The near complete resolution of 
holometabolan relationships by nuclear PCGs has been one of the most significant recent 
accomplishments in insect phylogenetics (see discussion in 120) but have yet to be really explored with 
mt genome data.   
 
Intraordinal relationships have also been widely studied using mt phylogenomics, with significant 
numbers of papers investigating relationships within each of the five megadiverse orders plus Orthoptera 
(47, 72).  Compared to the most extensive nuclear PCG studies (35), mt phylogenomics studies of the 
Hemiptera are of equivalent scale (36, 111), and are actually larger scale within the Heteroptera (74).  
There is extensive variation in subordinal relationships both between different mt phylogenomic datasets 
and between mt genomes and nuclear PCGs; sources of topological variation have yet to be tested.  Mt 
phylogenomics studies of Hymenoptera (e.g. 44, 77) recover broadly similar relationships to nuclear data 
(58). Extensive gene rearrangements (see below), the most compositional biased mt genomes within 
insects (77) and highly variable substitution rates between lineages (44), however, make the analysis of 
hymenopteran relationships with mt phylogenomics challenging.  The Coleoptera are a similarly 
challenging order with substantial base compositional heterogeneity between major clades (108, 110).  
Rooting trees within the order, using Archostemata as an outgroup, improves phylogenetic resolution 
(118), however, backbone relationships are not strong supported and in conflict with nuclear studies (60).  
Due to a parallel sequencing effort, direct comparisons of mt phylogenomic and nuclear PCG analyses 
can be made for the Diptera (127).  Relationships between brachyceran families are highly congruent 
(21), and mt genomes provided the first evidence for a now-resurrected Orthorrhapha.  In contrast 
relationships within the “nematocera” are quite divergent between nuclear and mt datasets, particularly in 
the relative positions of the infraorders Culicomorpha and Bibionomorpha (4).  Finally, although the 
range of lepidopteran superfamilies represented is still modest (8 of 43), mt phylogenomics studies are 
highly congruent with nuclear-gene analyses (84, 95, 135).  However, unlike these nuclear datasets, 
lepidopteran mt genome datasets find significant nodal support for relationships between superfamilies 
(135).  Interestingly, an mt genome phylogeny was the first to show the paraphyly of the 
Macrolepidoptera, with the butterflies (Papillionoidea) forming part of a basal grade of superfamilies in 
the Obtectomera (134), a finding not acknowledged by either of the subsequent large-scale phylogenies of 
Lepidoptera (84, 95).   
 
Overall then the use of mt genomes to infer intraordinal relationships has been widely applied across 
insects and in most instances is broadly congruent with other phylogenetic data sources.  For ancient 
relationships (e.g. interordinal, major subordinal clades) the nodal support resulting from mt genomes is, 
for the majority of clades, significantly higher than all but the largest multi-locus phylogenetic studies.

----- Page 9 (native) -----
Areas of topological conflict are typically areas of poor nodal support in one or both studies, suggesting 
that additional data and refined analytical methods could potentially resolve most, if not all, conflicts.  A 
final point that should be made is that these studies have been largely conducted in isolation from nuclear-
gene or morphological datasets.  Historically, due to technical and financial demands, mt genomes are not 
simultaneously analysed with nuclear data (see 127 as a major exception).  Today, neither reason still has 
much validity.  Greater coordination in the collecting of mt genomes, nuclear gene sequences and 
morphology for exemplar taxa should be the goal for the future of this field.   
 
Genome Rearrangements & Insect Evolution 
The second major use of mt genome data in elucidating insect evolutionary history is the identification of 
gene rearrangements shared amongst related lineages, or as Mark Dowton (41) termed it “the examination 
of genome morphology.”  More generally, mt genome rearrangements are part of a class of phylogenetic 
markers termed “rare genomic changes” (97) which are considered to have very low rates of homoplasy.  
Other examples from the nuclear genome include SINEs/LINEs, genetic code variants and microRNA 
insertions (97) and in mt genomes, macrorepeats (25), conserved secondary structures (25), tRNA gene 
conversions (59) and signature base substitutions (83).  Conceptually the use of mt genome 
rearrangements as phylogenetic markers has much to recommend it (14): the gene set is near constant 
across bilaterian animals, gene homology is usually unambiguous (but see 59), rearrangements appear to 
be uncommon, gene order is apparently selectively neutral (45) and given the large number of potential 
gene orders (37! or 1.367 x 1043) the possibility of convergence must be low.  Accordingly instances of 
genome rearrangements within insects have been received considerable attention.  Indeed, the possibility 
that rearrangement data could be used to unravel insect ordinal relationships lay behind the author’s first 
job in mt genomics as a spotty postdoc over a decade ago. 
 
The different arrangement of two mt genomes can be described by a standard series of gene movements: 
transposition, inversion and inverse transposition (41).  It has been common to refer to “major” and 
“minor” rearrangements to describe ones which involve, respectively, protein-coding and/or rRNA genes 
versus tRNA genes alone.  Finally the distance which a gene has moved within the genome as part of the 
rearrangement is often described as short range rearrangements are held to be more frequent.  Thus the 
rearrangement of a pair of genes, e.g. A-B to B-A, is described as “gene shuffling” (45).  These terms can 
be combined, for instance a rearrangement found in Apis, trnD-trnK, can be described as a “minor 
transposition” from the ancestral insect arrangement trnK-trnD.  While it has been historically common to 
infer the number of rearrangements which separate two genomes by hand, this is less reliable for more 
extensively rearranged genomes which multiple possible sequences of rearrangement can be inferred.  
Software such as CREx standardizes such inferences and allows more repeatable interpretation of 
rearrangement histories (8, 9).   
 
Such descriptive terms, however, are largely independent of the underlying mechanisms which cause mt 
genome rearrangements.  The most widely accepted mechanism for explaining mt genome 
rearrangements is the “Tandem Duplication, Random Loss” (TDRL) model (13, 81).  In the TDLR 
model, first a portion of the mt genome is duplicated resulting in two copies of a block of genes.  Gene 
duplications could occur via one of several methods, slipped strand mispairing during replication, 
imprecise termination of replication, dimerization of the genome or recombination (81).  Once duplicated,

----- Page 10 (native) -----
the accumulation of mutations within the copied genes will eventually render one of them non-functional, 
at which point the selective pressure for reduction in genome size (92) results in the elimination of the 
non-functional gene.  TDRL readily explains transpositions but cannot explain inversions, consistent with 
the observed, low frequency of inversions.  TDRL also explains why both minor and shuffling 
rearrangements are most common – a shorter stretches of DNA must be duplicated before a tandem gene 
block is created.  It also explains the increased rate of rearrangements for genes adjacent to the origin of 
replication, as both strand slippage and imprecisely termination are more likely to include the genes 
surrounding the origin of replication in the duplicated gene block.  Finally several insects have been 
found which are apparently part-way through the TDRL process, e.g. the scorpionfly Microchorista 
which a 3.5kb duplication of 3 protein-coding genes and 7 tRNAs each of which display heightened rates 
of substitutions and indels (5).  The existence of intermediates is good proof for the sequence of events 
outlines in the TDRL model.  Across insects, TDRL explains most of the observed mt genome 
rearrangements, in contrast to vertebrates where it explains almost all observed rearrangements (45).   
 
Two other rearrangement mechanisms have received considerable attention: tandem-duplication, non-
random deletion (TDNR) and recombination.  TDNR is similar to the TDRL model except that gene-loss 
is constrained by transcriptional blocks within the genome (71).  Genes duplicated across the boundaries 
of these transcriptional blocks cannot be expressed and so are eliminated; gene loss is thus non-random.  
TDNR has not often been invoked to explain rearrangements in insects, however the highly rearranged 
genome of the winter crane fly, Paracladura is consistent with duplication of the entire mt genome 
followed by the loss of multigene transcription blocks (4).  The third mechanism proposed to cause mt 
genome rearrangements is recombination.  Despite a history of contention around the possibility of 
mitochondrial recombination (81), gene inversions cannot be explained without some form of 
recombination (40).  Inversions are the least common type of rearrangements found in insects and have 
only been recorded from the orders Dermaptera (122), Hymenoptera (45) and all three of the 
Paraneopteran orders (101, 103, 117, 125).   
 
Many insect species possess the ancestral pancrustacean mt genome arrangement, however independent 
rearrangements are found in many orders.  Unfortunately there is no equivalent of Jeff Boore’s discovery 
of the Pancrustacea (15): a rearrangement which profoundly altered our understanding of insect evolution.  
Today, with a representative mt genome sequenced from each order, plus representatives from each of the 
largest subordinal clades of most orders, it is clear that there are no gene rearrangements shared between 
orders.  Instead the synapomorphic mt genome rearrangements found in insects define clades at a variety 
of taxonomic scales below the level of order (Table 2); clearly rearrangements are not at all clock-like.  In 
addition there are a large number of taxa in which a unique rearrangement has been noted in a single 
species but the taxonomic extent of these rearrangements has not been determined.  Such examples range 
from single tRNA rearrangements e.g. Ischalia (Coleoptera: Anthicidae, 118) through to rearrangements 
of multiple protein-coding genes e.g. Aposthonia (Embioptera: Oligotomidae, 67).  It is however apparent 
that, with the notable exceptions of hemipteroids and hymenopterans (see below), mt genome 
rearrangements within insects are rare events.  In most of the instances noted in Table 2, the 
synapomorphic rearrangement is the only one found in that order.  With the same taxon exceptions, they 
are also reliable phylogenetic markers.  There are few instances where additional rearrangements have 
resulted in the secondary loss of the synapomorphic gene order and convergence homoplasies are rare.  
The most notable convergence is the rearrangement trnK-trnD → trnD-trnK which is found in 
acridomorph grasshoppers (49) and has occurred independently in at least five hymenopteran families:

----- Page 11 (native) -----
Apidae (34), Stephanidae (45), Braconidae (124), Formicidae (55), Scelionidae (77).  Thus empirically, 
within insects mt genome rearrangements largely fulfil the criteria of ideal phylogenetic characters which 
early enthusiasts hypothesized they would possess (14, 97).   
 
There are however two enormous exceptions, Hymenoptera and the Hemipteroids, where extremely high 
rates of genome rearrangement at best have obscured the phylogenetic reliability of observed 
rearrangements and at worst resulted in rampant homoplasy.  The Hymenoptera have very high rates of 
tRNA rearrangements; every sequenced hymenopteran species has at least one translocated tRNA.  It was 
established early that tRNA rearrangement were common within Hymenoptera and that the multi-gene 
tRNA blocks were “hot spots” of rearrangement (39, 42, 43).  A review of hymenopteran rearrangements 
(45), found that of the 67 rearrangements identified to that time, only five were shared between two or 
more species and of those only two were genuinely synapomorphic.  Unique rearrangements were 
extremely common and convergence between local tRNA rearrangements common.  Despite increasing 
taxonomic coverage and depth of sampling within major groups, the hymenopteran mt genomes 
sequenced since 2009 have served to confirm pattern.  The one exception is the Chalcidoidea which 
appear to share an inverted block of five protein-coding genes (132).  The identification of 
synapomorphic rearrangements within the Hymenoptera is thus not impossible but is hampered by high 
rates of noise and significant taxonomic coverage is required to confirm putative synapomorphies.   
 
The Hemipteroids have even greater rates of rearrangement and correspondingly higher difficulties in 
providing unambiguous interpretations.  All three hemipteroid orders include highly rearranged taxa 
although within the Hemiptera they are confined to the whiteflies (Aleyrodidae) (Thao et al. 2004), the 
heteropteran Stenopirates (73) and isolated examples of tRNA rearrangements; the majority of families 
which have been sequenced possessing the ancestral insect arrangement.  Both of the available 
Thysanoptera (thrips) mt genomes are massively rearranged relative the ancestral insect, retaining only 7 
of 37 gene boundaries, but quite similar to each other, differing by just 6 tRNA transpositions (101, 133).  
The lack of mt genomes from thysanopteran families other than Thripidae means that these findings are 
difficult to contextualise, however a recent phylogeny suggests that the two sequenced genera (Thrips, 
Frankliniella) represent the most widely divergent clades within this speciose family (17).  This suggests 
that mt genomes within thrips have been stable over long evolutionary timescales after some early 
massive rearrangement.  The final order, the Psocodea includes what was formerly two orders, the 
barklice (= Psocoptera) and true lice (= Phthiraptera) (62).  Available psocopteran mt genomes include 
independent major rearrangements from the ancestral insect gene order (104, 125, Cameron pers. obs), 
however louse mt genomes are the most rearranged of all arthropods (103).  Louse mt genomes retain 
between three (Bothriometopus, 22) and none (Ibidoecus, 24) of the derived gene boundaries found in the 
ancestral insect mt genome.  Further, with the exception of two very closely related species from the 
family Gonioidae, very few novel gene arrangements are shared between lice either.  Previously (24), I 
identified only 11 arrangements shared between any two louse species of which four were convergent 
when mapped onto an independent phylogenetic tree and five required the postulation of secondary loss 
to be interpreted as synapomorphies.  Confidence in these interpretations was further undermined by the 
observation of only partial genome sequences for several species due to the presence of genome mini-
circles in several louse lineages (see below).  Collectively the variation observed within louse mt 
genomes greatly exceeds our capacity to reliably infer evolutionary patterns from the available species 
diversity and a huge additional sequencing effort is needed to bring order to this chaos.

----- Page 12 (native) -----
The final question is what causes mt genome rearrangements to be elevated in particular groups (as 
opposed to the mechanisms by which rearrangements occur).  This has received considerable attention, 
with a focus on life-history traits as predictors of rearrangements.  Parasitism has been repeatedly invoked 
as a predisposing factor (42, 103), which is unsurprising given the highly rearranged mt genomes found in 
several parasitic insect groups.  Tests of this hypothesis, however, have largely rejected it.  A test of 
rearrangement rates between parasitic and non-parasitic groups within the Hymenoptera and Diptera, 
concluding that there was no correlation between parasitism and rearrangements in flies (30).  Similarly, 
more detailed studies of Hymenoptera showed that heightened rates of rearrangement did not correspond 
with the evolution of parasitism within the order (45).  What these studies have shown, is that there is a 
strong correlation between increased rearrangement and nucleotide substitution rates in parasitic lineages 
(30, 104), however it is not clear if one causes the other or if they both the common result of a third 
factor.  A second cause of rearrangements that has been proposed is duplication of the control region 
(CR) which has occurred in thrips and barklice (101, 105, 133).  The effect of duplicated CRs on 
rearrangement rates has not been adequately tested, however, within thrips they actually coincide with 
quite stable genome arrangements as only six tRNA rearrangements have occurred between the two 
thripid species with duplicated CRs.  Finally there may be a correlation between mt genome 
rearrangements and the evolution of haplodiploidy.  Heightened rearrangement rates are found in four of 
the eight insect groups which have independently evolved haplodiploidy (sciarid flies, Hymenoptera, 
Thysanoptera, Aleyrodidae) and mt genome data is not available for the other four clades (Micromalthus 
beetles, Xyleborini weevils, Hypothenemus weevils and coccoid scales) (88).  The one exception is lice 
which are not haplodiploid but do practise a form of paternal genome elimination which can result in 
similar genomic inheritance patterns as classical haplodiploidy (80).  The causes of mt genome 
rearrangements in insects are likely multifactorial and much additional research is required.   
 
Model Systems for “Aberrant” Mitochondrial Genomics 
The final aspect of study on insect mt genome evolution is as model systems for understanding “aberrant” 
genomic systems.  Given the stability of mt genome structure and function across insects, studying 
examples which depart from these trends can be highly informative about what factors underlie that 
stability.  Two interesting examples which have been recently discovered from insects are gene truncation 
in gall midges (6) and genome fragmentation in lice and near relatives (106).   
 
In cecidomyiid gall midges, each tRNA gene has been severely truncated (6).  Over 90% of metazoan 
tRNAs posses a canonical clover-leaf secondary structure composed of four arms of conserved length: the 
aminoacyl (or acceptor) arm which holds the isotype specific amino acid, the dihydrouridine (or DHU) 
arm, the anticodon arm which determines tRNA isotype, and the pseudouridine or TC arm (63).  The 
one exception is trnS1 which lacks the DHU arm in most metazoans.   
The entire TC arm and the 3’ end of the acceptor stem have been lost from each tRNA gene in 
cecidomyiids, whereas there is a high sequence-level conservation of the DHU and anticodon stems (6).  
The only groups where similar truncations have been found are nematodes (130), and some chelicerates 
(38, 78) in which the TC stem is lost for some tRNA isotypes.  Additionally, most tRNAs of spiders 
lack paired acceptor stems (38).  The truncation of cecidomyiid tRNAs is, however, more extreme as it 
affects all tRNA isotypes and in all instances resulted in physically shorter genes (6).  It is unclear what

----- Page 13 (native) -----
factors may have lead to these truncated tRNAs, although it may be a result of generalised evolutionary 
pressures for size reduction in mt genomes (92).  Such an explanation however would require the 
existence of compensatory mechanisms.  Polycistronic transcript processing would differ as the tRNA 
secondary structures no longer form recognition sites for mRNA cleavage (89).  Secondly, recognition of 
tRNA isotype by tRNA-synthetases is based on conserved sequences in both the anticodon and acceptor 
stems (10).  Template-dependent RNA editing, using the 5’ end of the acceptor stem as a template for 
polymerising the missing bases after transcript cleavage, has been proposed as a means to restore proper 
functionality to truncated tRNAs (6).  This type of RNA editing has been observed in centipedes (70), 
however the enzymes which perform the editing are unknown.   
 
The second major model “aberrant” system found in insects is the multi-chromosomal mt genomes found 
in several lineages of lice and bark lice.  First observed in the human body louse Pediculus (106), the 
fragmentation of the mt genome into several chromosomes has occurred multiple times in the Psocodea.  
Departures from the single chromosome mt genome found in almost all bilaterians are extremely rare, 
being recorded only in the potato-cyst nematode Globodera (2, 51) the rotifer Brachionus (112).  The 
multi-chromosomal mt genomes found in lice are, however, both more variable in structure and occur in a 
wider range of taxa than either of these earlier examples.  Genome reductions have occurred at least 4 
times in lice and one in psocoptera (Liposcelis) and at least three different types of genome structures are 
found (24, 125).  Heteroplasmic genome reductions, where a minicircular 23-gene chromosome coexists 
with a full sized 37-gene chromosome, are found in goniodid pigeon lice.  Stable genomes composed of 
several, multi-gene chromosomes are found independently in several louse lineages and Liposcelis.  
Finally, the most extreme genome fragmentation, into a large number of chromosomes each with 1-3 
genes and a large conserved non-coding region, appears to be synapomorphic for the sucking lice, the 
Anoplura, and their chewing lice sister-group, the Trichodectidae.  Analyses of mt genome variability 
within human lice has shown that the multi-chromosomal state corresponds to high rates of recombination 
(107) including the formation of chimeric chromosomes composed of two or more minicircles (102).  
While mt genome fragmentation was initially linked to blood feeding in derived lice (106), analyses of 
the nuclear-encoded, mt-targeted maintenance genes in Pediculus suggested that the loss of one of the 
replisome genes, mt single-stranded binding protein (mtSSB), was likely responsible (24).  The 
replication of full length mt genomes is not possible without this gene however the minicircle sized ones 
found in Pediculus could be replicated by rest of the polymerase holoenzyme (68).  Whether mtSSB is 
lost or has altered functionality in other psocodean lineages with multi-chromosomal mt genomes is 
unknown.  Deletion- and minicircular mt genomes are found in humans where they cause metabolic, 
neurodegenerative or age-related diseases (121).  Understanding how lice tolerate mt genome structures 
lethal in other species, presumably purifying selection explains their absence from most lineages, could 
highly instructive about general mt genome function.   
 
Interestingly both of these examples, gall-midges and lice, are from groups with unusual nuclear 
genomics in addition to their mt genomic peculiarities.  Both have extremely small nuclear genomes (53), 
and can eliminate chromosomes as part of significant departures from normal Mendelian genetics (80, 
88).  As discussed above, there is strong correspondence between instances of haplodiploid nuclear 
genetics and mt genome rearrangements (88).  The interactions between the nuclear and mt genome 
evolution has been largely unexplored to date but are a promising line of investigation in furthering our 
understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of insect mt genomes.

Summary Points 
1. The mt genomes of insects are the best studied of all the invertebrates, with almost 500 species 
sequenced to data.  The representativeness of this dataset is also excellent, including all orders, 
most suborders and significant sampling of major lineages within the megadiverse orders.  While 
clear gaps in our sampling can be identified, of which the coccoid scales are the most glaring, 
recent advances in sequencing technology suggest that these can be readily filled in the coming 
years.  
2. Extensive mt phylogenomic analyses of insects has clearly illustrated best practise.  All 37 genes 
should be included as a matter of course, however, potential biases due to the inclusion of third 
codon positions evaluated in each dataset.  Base compositional biases affect many insect mt 
genomes, however, this effect is not adequately compensated for by standard analytical software.  
Rate variation is also common, but can be corrected for by partitioning strategies.  Partitioning 
approaches vary significantly between studies, however its effect is rarely tested.  Too many 
recent studies still use a single, arbitrarily chosen analytical design testing and the sensitivity of 
results should be much more widely tested. 
3. Empirical results from mt phylogenomics studies are informative at many levels in insect 
systematics.  The results obtained are rarely wildly incongruent with those from morphology or 
nuclear gene sets and usually have much higher levels of nodal support for deep-level nodes.  The 
wider integration of mt genome data with nuclear phylogenetic studies will serve to strengthen the 
hypotheses generated by either dataset in isolation. 
4. Genome rearrangements are rare in the majority of insect orders.  Where they occur they are 
usually synapomorphic, however, the taxonomic level to which they map varies widely.  The 
Hymenoptera and Psocodea have exceptionally diverse gene orders, with convergent 
rearrangements found in unrelated taxa.  Haplodiploidy, either obligate or via paternal genome 
elimination, may be a predisposing factor toward mt genome rearrangement.   
5. The stability of insect mt genomes across hundreds of millions of years means that groups which 
differ wildly from norms can be great model systems for understanding how mt genomes function 
and the selective constraints on them.  
6. The future of the field lies in ever greater integration between nuclear and mt genome datasets.  
Improved phylogenetic resolution will come from large integrated datasets.  Understanding the 
nuclear contribution to mt genome replication and maintenance will improve our understanding of 
mutational constraints on substitution, gene order and genome structure.

Mini-Glossary 
Transpositions: movement of a gene or genes without change of translational direction.   
Inversions: movement of a gene or genes with change of translational direction.   
Inverse transpositions: movement and inversion of a gene or genes.   
Gene boundaries: description of shared adjacent genes e.g. two species which share trnD-trnK share this 
gene boundary.  May be either ancestral, present in ancestral insect, or derived, a novel occurrence in one 
or more lineages.

What are mitochondria? 
The mitochondrion is a fundamental eukaryotic organelle, descended from an alpha-proteobacterium which formed 
a permanent symbiosis with the ancestral eukaryote roughly 2 billion years ago.  Their best studied function is 
energy production via oxidative phosphorylation – the aerobic breakdown of organic molecules to form ATP.  
Mitochondria themselves possess two unit membranes, a smooth outer membrane and an inner membrane 
composed of highly convoluted, transverse folds termed cristae.  A series of four protein complexes, the electron 
transport chain (ETC), located in the mt inner membrane pass electrons from respiration intermediates (NADH or 
succinate) to oxygen, producing water and pumping protons into the mt intermembrane space.  Balancing the 
electrochemical gradient between the intermembrane space and the mt matrix produced by the ETC is coupled to 
ATP production by ATP synthetase.  The proteins encoded by the mt genome form part of 3 of the 4 ETC 
complexes and ATP synthetase, however the vast majority of mt active proteins are encoded in the nucleus.  
Mitochondria also have functions in apotosis and cell-aging meaning that mt are implicated in many degenerative 
diseases of aging.  Mt are retained even in anaerobic species which cannot undergo oxidative phosphorylation as 
they are the site of other cellular biochemistry.
