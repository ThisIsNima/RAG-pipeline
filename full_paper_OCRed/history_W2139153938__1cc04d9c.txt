INTRODUCTION
The remarkable mammals known as “bats” and “ﬂying
foxes” (order Chiroptera [“hand wing”]) may be the most
abundant, diverse, and geographically dispersed vertebrates
(Table 1). Although a great deal is known about them, detailed
information is needed to explain the astonishing variations of
their anatomy, their lifestyles, their roles in ecosystems ecol-
ogy, and their importance as reservoir hosts of viruses of
proven or potential signiﬁcance for human and veterinary
health.
Bats ﬂy with wings which range in span from 130 mm to 2 m.
Bats of various species feed on insects, mammals, ﬁsh, blood,
fruit, and pollen. Bats of most species echolocate to navigate
and to ﬁnd prey. Bats are found on all continents except Ant-
arctica. Bats also are being increasingly recognized as reservoir
hosts for viruses which can cross species barriers (i.e., “spill
over”) to infect humans and other domestic and wild mam-
mals. Nonetheless, studies of the natural histories of bats and
their importance as reservoir hosts of zoonotic viruses largely
have been underappreciated and underfunded, except for their
role in maintaining and transmitting rabies virus. Irrespective
of the negative public perception of bats, they are critical
elements of all terrestrial biotic communities. They help con-
trol insects, reseed cut forests, and pollinate plants that provide
food for humans and other species, and their guano is used as
a fertilizer and for manufacturing soaps, gasohol, and antibi-
otics (21, 69, 83). Bat echolocation and signal processing have
provided models for sonar systems (112, 130).
Myths and misunderstandings about the roles of bats in
ecosystems and their danger to other species as hosts of rabies
virus have led to efforts to extirpate bat populations, with
serious consequent effects on insect control and crop produc-
tion, without coincidental reduction in the already low inci-
dence of rabies virus transmission by bats (93).
This paper summarizes what is known about viruses isolated
from bats. Although there is serologic evidence for infection of
bats with many viruses (see, for example, references 82 and
101), we will focus here only on the 66 viruses that have been

isolated from or detected in bat tissues (Table 2) and the roles
of bats in maintaining and transmitting viruses. Some of these
bat-borne viruses can cause diseases of humans and other
animals. The roles played by bats in the maintenance and
transmission of viruses require consideration of the unique
characteristics that distinguish bats from all other mammals.
Examples are drawn from the extensive literature on rabies
virus in bats, as well as from recent data on the roles of bats in
the natural cycles of other viruses.
Evolution and Phylogeny of Bats
Whereas other mammals, such as certain species of rodents
(order Rodentia) and carnivores (order Carnivora), may pos-
sess traits in common with species of bats, such as the ability to
hibernate, no group of mammals shares the full suite of at-
tributes that make bats unique. Of the more than 4,600 recog-
nized species of mammals, 925 (about 20%) are bats (147).
Bats are grouped into two suborders: Megachiroptera, contain-
ing a single family, Pteropodidae (42 genera, comprising 166
species), and Microchiroptera, containing 16 bat families (135
genera, comprising 759 species) (Table 1) (138).
Bats evolved early and have changed relatively little in com-
parison with mammals of other taxa (69). Although the fossil
record of bat evolution is incomplete (77), a recent analysis of
17 nuclear genes dated the origin of chiropterans to the Eo-
cene period (52 to 50 million years ago), coincident with a
signiﬁcant rise in global temperature (147). Three major mi-
crochiropteran lineages were traced to Laurasia and a fourth
to Gondwana (147). The correspondingly ancient origins de-
duced for certain zoonotic viruses maintained in bats, such as
the henipaviruses (60) and lyssaviruses (10), suggest a long
history of cospeciation. Viruses that evolved with bats may
have used for replication cellular receptors and biochemical
pathways which are conserved in mammals that evolved later
and which underwent radiation in later geological periods. If
so, these conserved cellular receptors and pathways could en-
hance the capacity for transmission of bat-associated viruses to
other mammals.
Ability To Fly
Bats are unique among mammals in their ability to ﬂy. Bats
ﬂy daily in pursuit of food, and bats of many species ﬂy long
distances during seasonal migrations (62). For example, bats of
Myotis spp. may travel 200 to 400 miles from their winter
hibernation sites (reviewed in reference 62), and Mexican free-
tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis mexicana) migrate at least 800
miles between their summer caves in Texas and New Mexico
and their overwintering sites in Mexico (36) and are otherwise
very widely distributed. In France, rabies virus infections have
been associated with the migratory routes of Nathusius’ pipis-
trelle (Pipistrellus nathusii) bats (20). Silver-haired bats (La-
sionycteris noctivagans) seasonally range from Alaska, across
Canada, and south to Texas (13). Rabies virus variants associ-
ated with silver-haired bats and the Eastern pipistrelle (Pipis-
trellus subﬂavus) have been identiﬁed from numerous locations
throughout the geographic range of these bats (106, 124), and
the same variants have been identiﬁed as the cause of the
majority of cases of indigenously acquired human rabies in the
United States and Canada (127).
Different patterns of migration within the same species of
bat, as occurs with relatively solitary species, such as the silver-
haired bat (69), and colonial cave-dwelling species, such as
Mexican free-tailed bats (128), may permit exchange of novel
viruses or virus variants between migrating and nonmigrating
subpopulations of conspeciﬁcs or bats of other species. A Mex-
ican free-tailed bat infected with a rabies virus variant normally
associated with hoary bats (Lasiurus cinereus), suggests inter-
species transmission (124). In the ﬁeld, rabid bats of one spe-
cies have been observed to be aggressive toward bats of other
species (14). Moreover, Shankar et al. (136), in a study of the
phylogenesis of divergence of rabies viruses from bats and
terrestrial animals in Colorado, found that bats of different
species had the same genotypic variants, indicating active in-
terspecies transmission of rabies virus. They concluded that, at
least in Colorado, animal rabies occurs principally in bats and
that identiﬁcation of bat-associated variants of rabies viruses in
domestic cats, gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), and
striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) demonstrates the impor-
tance of rabies virus spillover from bats to domestic and ter-
restrial wild vertebrates.
Torpor and Hibernation
An important trait of temperate bats of the families Vesper-
tilionidae and Rhinolophidae is their ability to enter into daily
torpor and seasonal hibernation to conserve energy during
cool nights and winter months (89). The impact of torpor and
hibernation on the pathogenesis and maintenance of viral in-
fections in bats has not been studied extensively. However,
viruses may overwinter in bats, and persistently infected bats
may shed viruses, such as lyssaviruses (family Rhabdoviridae)
or ﬂaviviruses (family Flaviviridae) for extensive periods with-
out evidence of disease (143). Virus isolation and antibody
studies suggest that many viruses can cause persistent infec-
tions in bats (82).
When big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) and little brown bats
(Myotis luciﬁgus) were experimentally infected with Japanese
encephalitis virus (JEV) and then subjected to temperatures

titers in the blood of bats maintained at 24°C were equal to
peak viral titers at temperatures at which the bats were active.
Perhaps cold temperatures suppress immune responses that

tibody titers. Nevertheless, the fact that infectious JEV was
recovered from seropositive bats 15 weeks after the shift in
temperature indicated that infection persisted (143). It is pos-
sible that neutralizing antibody has a shorter half-life in bats
than in other mammals. Tick-borne encephalitis virus and
other viruses have been isolated from bats with neutralizing
antibody, and bats are susceptible to reinfection with tick-
borne encephalitis viruses (82).
High titers of virus were obtained from brown fat of appar-
ently healthy bats inoculated with rabies virus when the bats
were kept at low temperatures (4, 142, 143). Vampire bats
(Desmodus rotundus) that survive challenge with rabies virus
may excrete virus in their saliva (1). Rabies virus was isolated
from big brown bats that were captured to establish colonies
and then died in the ﬁrst month of captivity (135). Antiviral
antibodies were detected in sera of several apparently healthy
bats born in the new colony, suggesting past or subclinical
rabies virus infection (135). Mexican free-tailed bats may trans-
mit rabies virus transplacentally, as evidenced by the fact that
infectious virus was isolated from cell lines established from
fetal tissues of these bats (141). Studies of Mexican free-tailed
bats roosting at a colony in Austin, Texas, identiﬁed rabies
virus in about 70% of several hundred downed, dead, or dying
bats, which represented a relatively small proportion of the
estimated 600,000 bats in that colony. Over the study’s 2-year
duration, about 45% of apparently healthy bats from this roost
were found to have neutralizing antibody to rabies virus, sug-
gesting acquired immunity following prior exposure (101; C.
Rupprecht [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
Atlanta, Ga.], personal communication, 2006). Because only
one or another of many methods usually is applied in studies
of rabies virus in bats, we do not know the proportion of bats
having both viral RNA in their tissues and antibody to rabies
virus.
Temperate and tropical bats of the family Molossidae ap-
pear to be transitional between true hibernating bats and trop-
ical bats that have limited ability to enter torpor. For example,
the Western bonneted bat (Eumops perotis) enters a period of
daily torpor during the winter that is similar to the daily hiber-
nation or torpor that occurs in temperate zone bats during the
summer (89).
Long Life Span
The extreme longevity of bats, together with the possibility
that they might develop persistent infections with certain vi-
ruses, may help maintain the viruses and transmit them to
other vertebrates. Many species of small temperate bats of the
suborder Microchiroptera have life spans that exceed 25 years,
with the greatest longevity, of 35 years, documented for a little
brown bat. (On average, little brown bats weigh about 7 g.)
This extreme longevity in a small mammal places bats well
outside the traditional regression line for mammals that relates
the life expectancy (9) to the ratio of metabolic rate to body
weight (see reference 44, Fig. 45).
If bats routinely become persistently infected by certain vi-
ruses, and infectivity lasts for months or possibly years, the
impact on the basic reproductive number of infection (R0)
would be signiﬁcant. R0 is the expected number of newly in-
fected hosts that one infectious host will produce during its
period of infectiousness in a large population of completely
susceptible individuals (65). Since R0 is the sum of the products
of the average duration of infection, the average contact rate
between infectious and susceptible individuals, and the prob-
ability of transmission per contact between an infectious and a
susceptible individual, increased duration of infectiousness or
increased prevalence of infection in a population can dramat-
ically enhance the potential for secondary infections that em-
anate from a single infected individual. Persistent viral infec-
tions occurring among long-lived bats, coupled with their often
gregarious roosting behavior, could greatly increase the poten-
tial for intra- and interspecies transmission of viruses.
Population Size and Roosting Behavior
The frequently great population densities of bats and their
crowded roosting behavior increase the likelihood of intra- and
interspecies transmission of viral infections. Bats are the most
abundant of mammals, and except for humans and perhaps
rodents, they are the most widely distributed land mammals
(154). Certain species of bats, such as Mexican free-tailed bats,
are highly gregarious and roost in southwestern caves of the
United States, such as Carlsbad Caverns and Frio Cave, in
densely packed aggregates of approximately 300 bats per ft2
(37), in populations comprising several million individuals (37,
94). Under these conditions the only example of airborne ra-
bies virus transmission was documented, either in droplets of
excreta or by small particle aerosol (38, 155).
Bat Population Structure
The demographic and spatial structuring of bat populations
is sufﬁciently variable to offer opportunities for viruses that
cause both acute and persistent infections to be maintained.
The potential for migratory and nonmigratory populations to
serve as a mixing vessel for viruses has already been men-
tioned. Additionally, within given regions, bat populations may
be panmictic or may exist as metapopulations, offering the
potential for seasonal virus transmission and annual outbreaks
of viral diseases as well as the potential for periodic outbreaks
among spatially discrete populations.
Colonial microchiropterans (such as Schreibers’ long-ﬁn-
gered bat, Miniopterus schreibersii, and Mexican free-tailed
bats) typically exist in panmictic populations of hundreds of
thousands or millions of individuals and produce an annual
birth pulse (37). In theory, such large bat populations could
sustain acute viral infections that produce permanent steriliz-
ing immunity in affected individuals in a manner akin to that of
measles morbillivirus, which persists to cause annual outbreaks
only when human communities exceed 250,000 to 500,000 (16).
The persistence of measles virus within demographically het-
erogeneous human populations, whereby different communi-
ties are affected in different years, may give rise to viral per-
sistence in spatially discrete “patches,” in which infection dies
out sequentially rather than simultaneously (17).
A different pattern of social structure is present among other
colonial bats that have a metapopulation structure (consisting
of periodically interacting, spatially discrete subpopulations).
Flying foxes (Pteropus spp.) have such a structure. In this sit-
uation, the total number of individuals in the various subpopu-

----- Page 6 (native) -----
lations or “patches” must be sufﬁcient to maintain virus circu-
lation in the metapopulation over time, while immunity or
death due to viral infection extinguishes transmission chains
within individual subpopulations. Periodic outbreaks of viral
infection and disease may then be expected among given sub-
populations in a region, once the number of susceptible indi-
viduals has recovered through births or loss of immunity, such
that the populations once again can support viral transmission
with an R0 of 1. Such periodic outbreaks of acute, even fatal
viral disease are well documented for rabies virus among ter-
restrial carnivores (28) and may occur among vampire bats, as
exempliﬁed by the so-called “migration” of rabies virus in
vampire bat populations in different regions with a 2- to 3-year
cycle (19, 126). Preliminary modeling suggests that Hendra
virus persists in Australian ﬂying foxes in this way (H. E. Field,
unpublished data).
Given that the phylogenetic distance of Hendra virus (and
Nipah virus) from other viruses in the family Paramyxoviridae
suggests that these are ancient viruses that likely have an
evolutionary association with their ﬂying fox hosts, it is both
intuitive and biologically plausible that the maintenance of
Hendra virus infection in ﬂying foxes is based on the spa-
tially heterogeneous population structure and nomadic na-
ture of ﬂying foxes.
Echolocation
Microchiropteran bats are, with rare exceptions among the
Megachiroptera (69, 71), the only land mammals that emit
sounds and then detect and characterize the time delay and
signal properties of returning echoes for the purpose of navi-
gation (echolocation). Although certain birds and several spe-
cies of megachiropterans use primitive echolocation, the de-
gree to which neural and muscular systems of bats have
evolved to produce echolocation signals, protect the individual
bat from its own potentially deafening emissions, and decipher
the information contained in returning echoes is unique. How-
ever, acoustic imaging is energy-intensive, corresponding to an
energy ﬂux of as much as 6  106 J/m2 per echolocation call
(113). The intense, high-frequency echolocation signals, rang-
ing between 80 and 110 dB at a distance of 1 m from the
emitting bat, approximate the range between the noise level
produced by a coffee grinder and that produced at a rock
concert or by a jet plane at ramp (5, 113). Echolocation signals
are produced by the larynx, are powered by the muscles of the
abdominal wall of bats, and are emitted through the mouth or
nostrils (113). Production of such loud sounds also could gen-
erate droplets or small-particle aerosols of oropharyngeal ﬂu-
ids, mucus, or saliva, enabling transmission of viruses between
individuals in close proximity. The hypothesis that rabies virus
could be expelled from the nostrils of echolocating bats was
supported by the isolation of rabies virus from mucus obtained
from naturally infected Mexican free-tailed bats (39).
Bat Immunology
Why can certain viruses infect and persist in apparently
healthy bats yet be highly pathogenic for humans and other
vertebrates? Because bats were among the earliest mammalian
species to develop, it is possible that their innate and acquired
immune responses have important qualitative or quantitative
differences from those of the rodents and primates which have
been studied extensively. Do bats have a different set point in
their immune responses, one that results in control of the level
of virus replication without clearance of infectious virus in
order to prevent immunopathological responses in infected
tissues? Are all of the innate immune mechanisms that are
presumed to have preceded the development of acquired im-
mune responses also functional in bats? Is there afﬁnity mat-
uration of antibodies in bats? What are the properties of cell-
mediated immune responses in bats? Signiﬁcant differences in
immune responses to viral infection likely will be found among
the very large number and diversity of bat species, and it is
unlikely that immunological reagents will be reactive across all
bat species.
Very little is known about bat immune systems, although
several studies suggest that immune responses of bats have
some similarities with those of mammals that evolved after
bats. For example, immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, and IgM
have been puriﬁed from sera of great fruit-eating bats (Artibeus
lituratus) (96). Macrophages, B- and T-lymphocyte-like cells,
and cells expressing surface Ig were identiﬁed in the bone
marrow of Indian ﬂying foxes (Pteropus giganteus), indicating
that lymphoid development is generally similar in bats and
other mammals (26, 131). Presumably in bats, as with other
mammals, the generation of high-titer IgG requires two events
mediated by helper T cells: class switching and afﬁnity matu-
ration.
Serological assays that detect IgG antibodies to Hendra vi-
rus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-
CoV)-like viruses, and Ebola viruses in bats (66, 84, 85) indi-
cate that some virus-speciﬁc adaptive T- and B-cell responses
occur despite persistent virus infection. Further studies will
require development of cell culture-based assays for examining
lymphocyte proliferation, antibody synthesis, cytokine synthe-
sis, and a host of other immunologic functions in bats.
VIRUSES FOUND IN BATS
Table 2 lists the large number of viruses that have been
isolated from or detected in bats, but most of these viruses
have not been shown to be transmitted from bats to other
animals or to cause human disease. Transmission from bats of
viruses causing highly pathogenic disease has been demon-
strated for rabies virus and related lyssaviruses, Nipah and
Hendra viruses, and inferred for SARS-CoV-like virus of bats.
The relationships of these viruses to their bat hosts and to
zoonotic human diseases is described below. Other viruses in
Table 2, such as certain alphaviruses, ﬂaviviruses, and bunya-
viruses, may infect bats via arthropods, but it is not clear
whether bats are important reservoir hosts for these viruses.
Clearly, a great deal of additional research is needed to doc-
ument the roles of bats of different species in the natural
history of the many viruses for which these remarkable animals
can serve as hosts.
Rabies Virus
It would be impossible here to summarize the scientiﬁc lit-
erature with regard to rabies and rabies virus. Therefore, we
536
CALISHER ET AL.

will merely summarize what we believe is relevant to this re-
view. Descriptions of a disease consistent with rabies date from
4,000 years ago. The Eshnunna code invoked penalties for
knowingly allowing a “mad” dog to bite a human (12). In the
ﬁrst century of this era, Celsus warned of fatal bites from
animals and suggested that such bites may contain venom (i.e.,
“virus”). However, it was not until the late 19th century that
rabies virus was studied methodically. Louis Pasteur ampliﬁed
the virus in rabbit spinal cord and prepared and administered
a vaccine for postexposure prophylaxis. Those classical studies
laid the foundations for virology and immunology.
Rabies virus (family Rhabdoviridae, genus Lyssavirus, sero-
type 1/genotype 1) is transmitted between mammals, including
bats, primarily through the bite inoculation of rabies virus
present in the saliva of infected individuals (95). The dual
characters of transmitting rabies virus and being hematopha-
gous (i.e., vampire bats) have cast a shadow on bats. Bats of
three species (Diphylla ecaudata [hairy-legged vampire bat],
Diaemus youngi (white-winged vampire bat), and Desmodus
rotundus [vampire bat]) are known vampires and have been
found to be involved in transmission of rabies virus, although
available evidence indicates that only the latter is important in
this regard (149).
Globally, a vanishingly small proportion of the approxi-
mately 55,000 annual human deaths caused by rabies virus are
caused by variants of virus associated with bats (81). Although
most cases of indigenously acquired human rabies in the
United States are caused by bat-associated variants of rabies
virus, the average of 1 or 2 cases per year over the past 2
decades indicates the rarity of these events (101). In the United
States, most rabies victims do not recall having been bitten by
a bat, which may be due to the small size of the biting animal
or to unusual circumstances leading to the bite (127).
Recent evidence suggests that all rabies virus variants that
affect terrestrial carnivores originated from cross-species trans-
mission of bat-associated variants of rabies virus (10). A mo-
lecular clock model based on genetic divergence of rabies virus
variants in bats of different species suggests that in North
America the divergence of extant bat-associated rabies viruses
from a common ancestor occurred about 1651 to 1660 C.E.
The bat rabies virus variants found in Latin America in com-
mon vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) and in free-tailed bats
(genus Tadarida, family Mollosidae) are closest to the earliest
common ancestor. Adaptation of rabies virus variants occurred
earlier and more rapidly in bats of colonial genera (genera
Eptesicus and Myotis) than in bats of more solitary genera
(Lasionycteris, Pipistrellus, and Lasiuris) (74).
Bat variants of rabies virus sporadically spill over to infect
mammals other than humans (97). Sustained transmission of
bat variants of rabies virus within populations of red foxes on
Prince Edward Island and striped skunks in Arizona (40, 45)
proceeded until natural extinction or control by vaccination.
Lyssaviruses Related to Rabies Virus
Rabies virus is related to other lyssaviruses from bats, ro-
dents, and arthropods (137). There are seven lyssavirus geno-
types and an additional four novel genotypes recently recov-
ered from bats in Eurasia (Table 2), which probably will be
included in this genus (67, 151). Some of these viruses, most
notably Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV) (140), can cause a
fatal human illness indistinguishable from classic rabies (68,
129), but other lyssaviruses are not known to cause disease in
vertebrates. The diagnosis of rabies in humans and animals
traditionally was restricted to the acute fatal encephalomyelitis
caused by rabies virus serotype 1/genotype 1, but now the
disease “rabies” includes any of the fatal illnesses caused by
any lyssavirus (67).
Details of the maintenance cycles for lyssaviruses other than
rabies virus, such as Duvenhage, Lagos bat, and Mokola vi-
ruses (Table 2), are unclear (111). However, as with rabies
virus, their perpetuation is assumed to involve bite transmis-
sion, primarily involving conspeciﬁcs of the reservoir host spe-
cies, with occasional spillover to other susceptible vertebrates.
Individuals of other species have been sporadically found to be
infected by these rarely identiﬁed lyssaviruses, including a hu-
man with Duvenhage virus (100, 144), domestic cats and a dog
with Lagos bat virus (54, 80, 98), and humans, domestic cats,
and dogs with Mokola virus (15, 46, 47, 53, 110).
In May 1996, a lyssavirus was isolated from tissues of a black
ﬂying fox (Pteropus alecto) with signs of encephalitis found
near Ballina, New South Wales, Australia (55). Six months
later, a bat handler from Rockhampton, Queensland, Austra-
lia, developed numbness and weakness in her arm and later
died from encephalitis. She had been infected with what is now
known as ABLV. In 1998, a woman from Mackay (Queens-
land, Australia) was diagnosed with ABLV infection at her
death, 2 years after having been bitten by a sick bat (68).
Protection trials with mice conducted at the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Ga., indicated that a
rabies human diploid cell vaccine might be useful for prophy-
laxis against this virus (90). Recent serologic evidence suggests
that this virus also is present in bats in Thailand (88). Because
of the colonial nature of many bats, it is likely that this virus
may be found wherever the host bats are found.
Henipaviruses
In 1994 an outbreak of an acute respiratory illness occurred
in a human and 14 horses in Hendra, a suburb of Brisbane,
Australia. Twenty-one horses and two humans (the trainer and
a stable hand) were infected (109). Four additional outbreaks,
in 1994, 1999, and 2004, infected ﬁve horses and two humans,
killing all but one human (49, 72, 116, 123, 133).
A virus (family Paramyxoviridae, genus Henipavirus [named
after Hendra and Nipah viruses]) was shown to be the etiologic
agent of this disease (109). The natural hosts and probable
reservoirs of Hendra virus are fruit bats (“ﬂying foxes”) of the
genus Pteropus, including the black ﬂying fox (Pteropus alecto),
gray-headed ﬂying fox (P. poliocephalus), little red ﬂying fox
(P. scapulatus), and spectacled ﬂying fox (P. conspicillatus)
(50). Little is known about the dynamics of infection in ﬂying
foxes and how Hendra virus infection is maintained in them.
Field (50) proposed three alternative models for the main-
tenance of infection: (i) infection is enzootic in all species
throughout their distribution; (ii) infection is enzootic in a
particular species with a periodic epizootic pattern in the other
species; or (iii) infection is periodically epizootic in all these
species, persisting in a spatial or temporal mosaic across their
distribution. He contends that the apparent pattern of known
VOL. 19, 2006
BATS AND THE EMERGENCE OF VIRUSES
537

----- Page 8 (native) -----
“spillovers” from ﬂying foxes to horses ﬁts better with either of
the two latter hypotheses. That is, a periodic outbreak in a
local population of ﬂying foxes results in an increased proba-
bility of spillover to horses in a speciﬁc locality during a limited
time period. An outbreak of Hendra virus infection in a local
population of ﬂying foxes may depend on attainment of a
threshold number of susceptible ﬂying foxes in the population
and introduction of the virus into the population from a no-
madic individual or group. These concepts are well studied for
related morbilliviruses (17, 146). A situation analogous to the
circumstances being proposed for spillover of Hendra virus to
horses has been described for rabies virus spillover to domestic
cats. In the eastern United States, there is a strong association
between the local temporal dynamics of rabies epizootics
within a reservoir host species, in this case the raccoon (Pro-
cyon lotor), which serves as the regional reservoir host for a
speciﬁc variant of rabies virus, and an increase in the risk of
rabies spillover to domestic cats (59).
Nipah virus, a paramyxovirus related to Hendra virus, was
ﬁrst isolated in 1999 from pigs and adult human males affected
by fever and encephalitis, some with respiratory illness, during
a major outbreak in peninsular Malaysia and then in Singapore
(23, 24, 31). Of 265 reported human cases, 105 were fatal.
Direct contact with infected pigs was identiﬁed as the predom-
inant mode of human infection (33, 57). Most of the humans
affected in the Malaysian outbreak had a history of direct
contact with live pigs, and most were adult male Chinese pig
farmers (31, 117). More than 1 million pigs were culled to
contain the outbreak. With the knowledge that Pteropus spe-
cies bats were the likely reservoir of the closely related Hendra
virus in Australia, Malaysian bats were prioritized for surveil-
lance. Like most other countries in Southeast Asia, Malaysia
has a great diversity of bat species, including 13 species of
Megachiroptera and 60 species of Microchiroptera (99). The
large ﬂying fox (Pteropus vampyrus) and the variable ﬂying fox
(P. hypomelanus) were found to be natural reservoir hosts for
Nipah virus (34, 76).
Since 2001, sporadic outbreaks of Nipah virus-associated
disease in humans have been identiﬁed in Bangladesh (6, 7, 8,
73). Although many characteristics of these outbreaks were
similar to those of the Malaysian outbreak, including delayed
recognition, a primary presentation with fever and central ner-
vous system signs, and a high case fatality rate, in Bangladesh
the human cases were not associated with disease in pigs, and
there was some evidence suggesting human-to-human trans-
mission (73). Serologic surveys of domestic and wild animals
undertaken after the 2001 and 2003 outbreaks in Bangladesh
provided evidence of Nipah virus infection only in Indian ﬂying
foxes (6, 73). Concurrent serologic surveillance of Indian ﬂying
foxes in India in 2003 found that 54% had neutralizing anti-
bodies to Nipah virus (J. H. Epstein et al., personal commu-
nication, 2006), suggesting that Nipah virus or a closely related
virus was widespread across the range of Indian ﬂying foxes.
Chadha et al. (25) recently reported the occurrence of Nipah
virus infections in humans in India in 2001. Neutralizing anti-
bodies to Nipah virus were found in large ﬂying foxes in Indo-
nesia (134) and Cambodia (114), and Nipah virus was isolated
from Lyle’s ﬂying fox (Pteropus lylei) in Cambodia (121). Thus,
the henipaviruses likely occur across the entire global distribu-
tion of pteropid bats (66).
Available evidence suggests that Hendra and Nipah viruses
are ancient viruses that have long circulated in their natural
hosts, ﬂying foxes (60). What precipitated the apparent recent
emergence of these viruses? Can we identify environmental
factors that altered ﬂying fox ecology and facilitated the move-
ment of henipaviruses (and other bat-associated zoonotic
agents) beyond their natural ecological niches? Disease emer-
gence requires, in addition to the presence of an agent, an
effective bridge from the natural host to a susceptible spillover
host. Such bridges may be caused by changes to the agent, the
host, or the environment. Data on fruit bats of many species
suggest that populations are in decline throughout their range,
primarily as a result of habitat loss and hunting. In Australia,
fruit bat roosting sites recently have been increasingly redis-
tributed to urban areas (64). A scenario emerges of ﬂying fox
populations under stress, altered foraging and behavioral pat-
terns, and virus niche expansion, all leading to closer proximity
to humans and livestock. This certainly was the case with Nipah
virus emergence (35). Chong et al. (30) suggested that the risk
of humans contracting Nipah virus infection from bats is low.
Once Nipah virus escapes its natural cycle, its epidemiologic
characteristics are quite a different story.
Menangle and Tioman Viruses
Menangle virus (family Paramyxoviridae, genus Rubulavirus)
was isolated in 1997 from stillborn piglets at a large commer-
cial piggery near Menangle in Australia (118); the bat colony
and the piggery had coexisted for 29 years before the incident.
There were large numbers of within-litter fetal deaths at a
variety of gestational ages. Most sows carried their litters to
term, but abortions occasionally occurred. Affected litters in-
cluded mummiﬁed, autolyzing, fresh stillborn, and live piglets.
Teratogenic defects frequently seen included arthrogryposis,
brachygnathia, and kyphosis. Internally, part or all of the brain
and spinal cord was absent in most piglets, and there was
malacia and nonsuppurative inﬂammation of the brains and
spinal cords of some. Nonsuppurative myocarditis and hepati-
tis also were present in some piglets (118).
Two of 250 humans in contact with the infected pigs had
high titers of antibodies to the new virus, and both reported a
febrile illness with a measles-like rash, but neither had direct
exposure to ﬂying foxes (27). Individual bats living in a large,
mixed colony of gray-headed ﬂying foxes and little red ﬂying
foxes seasonally, and roosting within 200 m of the affected
piggery, had neutralizing antibodies (118), as did ﬂying foxes of
other species from other colonies thousands of kilometers dis-
tant and previous to the outbreak at Menangle (Field, unpub-
lished); other species in the vicinity of the affected piggery were
seronegative. Although attempts to isolate virus from ﬂying
foxes were unsuccessful, paramyxovirus-like virions labeled
with antibody to Menangle virus from a convalescent sow were
seen by electron microscopy in ﬂying fox feces collected be-
neath the roost near the piggery.
Tioman virus, a rubulavirus distinct from Menangle virus,
has been isolated from variable ﬂying foxes in Malaysia. Little
is known about the host range or pathogenesis of this newly
recognized paramyxovirus (32).

SARS-CoV-Like Viruses of Bats
In 2002, a previously unrecognized coronavirus (family
Coronaviridae) was found to cause a new, severe acute respi-
ratory syndrome in humans (92, 125). This virus, named
SARS-CoV, is a distant relative of the group 2 coronavi-
ruses that infect rodents, cattle, dogs, pigs, and humans and
has been assigned to group 2b (58). It is distinct from two
other coronaviruses recently identiﬁed in bats in southern
China (84, 119).
Epidemiologic studies showed that the earliest cases of
SARS were associated with the wildlife meat industry. A survey
of wildlife in a Shenzhen market recovered SARS-CoV-like
viruses from masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and raccoon
dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) and detected antibodies to the
SARS-CoV-like virus in a hog badger (Arctonyx collaris) (63).
Interestingly, the epidemiology of the outbreak in animals in
the wildlife meat market resembled that of shipping fever, a
viral syndrome that occurs when animals from different farms
are comingled under crowded, stressful conditions. Under such
circumstances, immune responses to persistent virus infections
are reduced, virus shedding is increased, and susceptible ani-
mals become infected and shed virus. In the marketplace
where SARS-CoVs were detected, viral RNA from some ani-
mals that were seronegative was detected by reverse transcrip-
tion-PCR, suggesting acute infection, while other animals had
antibodies to SARS-CoV but continued to shed virus, suggest-
ing persistent infections (63). Although no pathology was as-
sociated with SARS-CoV in animals in this market, civets
inoculated with human isolates of SARS-CoV had severe lung
pathology (156). By sequencing many viral genomes from
SARS patients, wild and farmed civets, and other animals, a
dendrogram was generated that showed that the ﬁrst human
SARS coronaviruses were closely related to a contemporary
virus from masked palm civets and that point mutations were
selected and accumulated later, as the virus passed from hu-
man to human (139).
Extensive surveys of viruses in domestic animals, poultry,
and wildlife were done by reverse transcription-PCR to iden-
tify the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV. Palm civets were
found to be an incidental host rather than the principal host for
SARS-CoV. Recently, several groups simultaneously identiﬁed
bats from different locations in southern China as being in-
fected with SARS-CoV-like viruses or having antibody to these
newly recognized coronaviruses, including members of several
species of Chinese horseshoe bats (suborder Microchirop-
tera, family Rhinolophidae, genus Rhinolophus) (Tables 1
and 2) (42, 84, 86). The prevalence of antibody to bat SARS-
CoV in some species of Chinese horseshoe bats was as high
as 84%. Pathology has not yet been associated with SARS-
CoV infection of bats.
The genomes of SARS-CoV isolates recovered from civets
and humans during the 2002-to-2003 outbreak of SARS lay
phylogenetically within the broad group of SARS-CoV-like
viruses of bats (86). These data show that the virus responsible
for the 2002-to-2003 outbreak most likely originated from this
group of bat-associated viruses. Antibody against SARS-CoV-
like viruses of bats was also detected in Leschenault’s rousette
(Rousettus leschenaultia), a cave-dwelling megachiropteran,
suggesting that fruit bats also may support infection with
SARS-CoV-like viruses. Thus, the natural history of SARS-
CoV appears to involve a previously unrecognized SARS-
CoV-like virus of bats being transmitted in meat markets to
amplifying hosts, including masked palm civets, raccoon dogs,
and a hog badger, and then spilling over to infect humans in
close contact with these intermediate hosts or their tissues.
Subsequent human-to-human transmission of the virus was
associated with adaptive mutations in the viral genome (139).
Ebola Viruses
Five viruses have been placed in the taxon Filoviridae. Four
of them (Ebola Zaire virus, Ebola Sudan virus, Ebola Ivory
Coast virus, and Ebola Reston virus) comprise the genus Ebo-
lavirus; Marburg virus comprises the genus Marburgvirus. The
natural reservoir hosts of these viruses have not yet been iden-
tiﬁed. However, Ebola virus RNA has been detected in terres-
trial mammals in the Central African Republic (107). Experi-
mental
infections
of
the
Angola
free-tailed
bat
(Mops
condylurus), little free-tailed bat (Chaerephon pumilus), and
Wahlberg’s epauletted fruit bat (Epomophorus wahlbergi) with
Ebola Zaire virus led to replication of virus in these bats (145).
Recently, Ebola virus RNA was detected in liver and spleen
tissues of three fruit bats: the hammer-headed fruit bat (Hyp-
signathus monstrosus), Franquet’s epauletted bat (Epomops
franqueti), and little collared fruit bat (Myonycteris torquata)
(85). Ebola virus-speciﬁc immunoglobulin M antibody was de-
tected in bats of the same species, but Ebola virus RNA was
not detected in bats with antibody, and antibody was not de-
tected in bats with Ebola virus RNA.
Detection of Ebola virus RNA in bats and rodents is a
fascinating ﬁnding, as is detection of antibody. However, until
and unless an Ebola virus (or Marburg virus) is isolated from
a wild vertebrate, and experimental infections unambiguously
demonstrate that the virus not only persists but is shed by that
animal and that disease can be transmitted under controlled
conditions, these ﬁndings will remain simply intriguing and
promising. Monath has postulated that there may be an as-yet-
undetected Ebola virus, one that is nonpathogenic but may
give rise to pathogenic genotypes by mutation, and that the
ﬁloviruses may be arthropod or plant viruses (105).
IMPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH ON
EMERGING VIRUSES OF BATS AND
OTHER WILDLIFE
Emerging Viruses and Wildlife Surveillance
Scores of newly recognized viruses have emerged in recent
decades, and elegant reviews have brought into focus the con-
tinuing importance of this phenomenon (91). It seems surpris-
ing, as though we are caught unawares, when a hitherto un-
recognized disease and its causative virus are discovered.
Recognition of the spillover of a zoonotic virus is precipitated
by human, livestock, or wildlife deaths, with considerable med-
ical, emotional, and economic miseries. We wonder how such
a virus could have evaded detection, why it had not been seen
to cause disease before, and whether it is a “new” virus. When
new emerging zoonotic viral diseases appear, reviews and grant
applications are written, explanations proffered, symposia or-

ganized, and molecular and other speciﬁc diagnostic tools de-
veloped. Unfortunately, one important method to predict
emergence of zoonotic diseases that has been overlooked re-
peatedly is the natural history survey, followed by targeted
studies of species of interest identiﬁed through the survey.
Survey research followed by targeted study has been used suc-
cessfully to explore the epidemiology of reservoir host-zoo-
notic virus maintenance, as exempliﬁed by studies on hantavi-
ruses in the southwestern United States (102, 103). These
studies have helped epidemiologists and public health ofﬁcials
make recommendations to reduce the risk of infection and to
help forecast the location and severity of future outbreaks of
hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (22, 51, 52, 56).
From about 1930 to about 1970, governments and private
institutions emphasized sending people into the ﬁeld to count,
trap, measure, bleed, and test vertebrates and invertebrates for
viruses. Although those surveys may not have provided answers
directly and quickly, they did provide specimens for future
analyses and questions to be addressed. Many “orphan” viruses
without known connection to disease were discovered. Infor-
mation regarding more than 500 viruses was collected by the
American Committee on Arthropod-Borne Viruses and pub-
lished in the International Catalogue of Arboviruses Including
Certain Other Viruses (78). This invaluable but badly outdated
compendium is slowly being replaced by Internet resources as
a means of information dissemination. Supplementing and re-
placing this printed catalogue are numerous databases (e.g.,
ICTVdB, The Universal Virus Database of the International
Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, available at http://www
.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ICTVdb/). Nevertheless, most of the cur-
rent data are limited in scope and in imagination. What is
needed is a survey of viruses of all vertebrates, inverte-
brates, plants, and other life forms. Although thoughts of
complete surveys obviously are wishful thinking, some sur-
vey efforts are better than none.
Information about the natural history of most viruses in bats
is limited. Regarding the conservation status of 914 bat species
listed by Wilson (153), omitting those that are, or are suspected
to be, extinct, 390 (42.7%) are considered not assessed (ade-
quately), 297 are considered stable, 201 are considered vulner-
able or potentially vulnerable, and 26 are considered endan-
gered. Of the 390 species that have not been assessed
adequately, 38 (9.7%) are of the family Pteropodidae, the Old
World fruit bats, from which the most recent virus emergences
have been observed. These 38 represent 59.4% of the 64 gen-
era in this family, indicating that we know relatively little about
the bats from which zoonotic viruses that cause human disease
have recently emerged. To various degrees, this can be said
about all bats, if not about all vertebrates.
Obviously, there is a need for comprehensive surveys of bats
in every place where they occur, although conservation con-
cerns must be addressed in the design of survey and sampling
methods, given that bats of many species are protected. Non-
killing techniques involving bleeding or procuring of oropha-
ryngeal and rectal swabs for PCR-based analyses, in addition
to collection of recently dead individuals, have been used to
determine viral infections and the prevalence of antibodies in
bats (see, e.g., references 43, 114, and 115). We know very little
about the 925 bat species that have been recognized, placed in
a taxon, and largely ignored after that. How many unrecog-
nized viruses do those bats harbor? Will any or all of these
viruses eventually be shown to be human, livestock, or wildlife
pathogens? What new viruses lurk in the other nearly 4,000
species of mammals and the thousands of species of other
vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and individuals of other
kingdoms, phyla, and classes? In effect, without even partial
predictive capacity, we are simply waiting for the next disas-
trous zoonotic virus outbreak to occur. Clearly, this is not an
effective prevention or prediction philosophy.
However, there is no simple solution to this need. Perhaps
part of the problem is lack of interest (ignorance?), and part is
due to lack of funding (there is not enough money for every-
thing). Surely in some countries, principally those from which
emerging disease are emerging, there is a lack of infrastruc-
ture, manpower, and even national will; these are political
questions. We suggest holding international symposia empha-
sizing the importance of both natural history surveys and of
knowledge as not only predictive tools but also disease-preven-
tion tools. Further emphasis on greater prioritization of such
studies might be shown to be very cost-effective in the long run.
Virus Isolation and Characterization
Virus isolation techniques and PCR assays now are ex-
tremely sensitive and rapid. These methods could provide the
opportunity to collect and store a massive amount of informa-
tion to accompany bat sera and tissue specimens. This would
provide us with at least some degree of intellectual prepared-
ness and with reagents that could be used to develop rapid
diagnostic assays for newly emerged viruses.
When a newly recognized virus is detected, virus identiﬁca-
tion is now done by PCR ampliﬁcation of viral nucleic acid, and
the resulting sequence data are compared with sequences in
the genetic databases, such as GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nih
.gov/GenBank/), to search for similarities with sequences of
recognized viruses. In addition, viral proteins (antigens) can be
expressed and used for serodiagnostic tests. If possible, the
infectious virus is isolated, antigens are prepared for diagnosis,
and experimental infections are conducted to study pathogen-
esis. Emerging viral diseases often are misdiagnosed. For ex-
ample, when the Nipah virus infection was ﬁrst reported in
Malaysia in 1999, the diagnosis was “JEV infection,” even
though (i) all the human patients were adult males, (ii) most or
all of those people had been vaccinated against JEV, (iii) pigs
suffered fatal disease (pigs do not die when infected with JEV;
they serve as amplifying hosts for that virus), and (iv) a virus
isolated from patients with the disease appeared by electron
microscopy to be a paramyxovirus, not a ﬂavivirus, as JEV is.
Only after it was realized that an intensive JEV vaccination
campaign was not diminishing transmission of this new disease
were other approaches initiated; by then, valuable time and
many lives had been lost. That outbreak can serve as an exam-
ple of our perpetual following of epidemic curves rather than
predicting them, of our lack of early recognition of emerging
diseases.
Diagnostic Limitations
At this time, diagnostic reagents or tests are available for all
the viruses shown in Table 2. However, to detect previously

unrecognized viruses, new reagents and approaches must be
developed or existing techniques applied. Among the new re-
agents, a variety of nested primers useful for exploratory PCR
might be formulated based on knowledge of sequences of recog-
nized viruses within the order Mononegavirales (which includes
Bornaviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Filoviridae, and Paramyxoviridae
[120]). In addition, bat family-speciﬁc or genus-speciﬁc conjugates
could be produced and applied for use in immunoﬂuorescence
assays or in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to identify an-
tibodies in sera or blood samples, or antigens in tissue samples.
Classical methods including hemagglutination-inhibition tests,
which are broadly cross-reactive, also could be developed using
inactivated antigens prepared from various recognized viruses.
Virus isolation assays, while potentially quite hazardous, also can
be applied if used with appropriate biocontainment. In this day of
increasing emphasis on molecular genetic tools for detecting viral
nucleic acids and for identifying nucleotide sequences rather than
the viruses themselves, it is frequently overlooked that virus iso-
lation provides us with a virus. With the virus itself, many areas of
research and development can be addressed, including develop-
ment of diagnostics, of animal disease models, and of vaccines.
Emphasis, sometimes complete emphasis, on nucleotide se-
quence characterization rather than virus characterization has led
us down a primrose path at the expense of having real viruses with
which to work.
Studies on Immune Responses of Bats
To understand the innate and acquired immune responses of
bats during acute and chronic virus infections, much additional
research is needed. It will be necessary to develop bat cell
culture-based assays and bat-speciﬁc reagents to examine lym-
phocyte proliferation, antibody and cytokine synthesis, cell-
mediated immune responses, and a host of other immunologic
functions in bats that are important reservoirs of emerging
viruses. A major challenge in studying T-cell responses in bats
is the apparent lack of inbred strains of bats. Such animals are
needed for long-term T-cell studies because of the require-
ment for matched major histocompatibility complex molecules
on T cells and antigen-presenting cells. Colonies of captive bats
might carry zoonotic viruses that could be transmitted to hu-
mans, so research on the bats and their cells might require
biological containment. In rodents, the growth factors required
for in vitro expansion and maturation of bone marrow stem
cells into competent antigen-presenting cells have been par-
tially characterized, leading to development of cell culture
assays for intermediate-term propagation of rodent T cells
(41). Similar strategies likely can be employed for propagation
of T cells from bats of various species.
Molecular genetics should be useful for analyzing bat im-
mune responses. More than 4,000 protein-encoding sequences
from chiropterans are in the National Center for Biotechnol-
ogy Information databases (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), but
of these only sequences for recombination activation genes 1
and 2 are immunologically relevant. Despite this limitation, it
should be possible to develop assays for evaluating such re-
sponses in infected bats. Perhaps most tractable and meaning-
ful for understanding these responses are analyses of cytokines
and chemokines, especially in conjunction with cell culture
assays. Capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and ﬂow
cytometry-based assays for a number of cytokines and chemo-
kines from conventional species have permitted an elegant
dissection of immune responses in humans and rodents. How-
ever, development of monoclonal antibody pairs for cytokine
detection assays requires substantial funding and effort. More
recent developments employing molecular approaches, such as
real-time PCR, cDNA arrays, and RNase protection assays,
have accelerated development assays for cytokine and chemo-
kine gene expression. These assays will require sequencing of
bat orthologs, but considering that 11 assemblies of mamma-
lian genomes are already available, it is likely that most genes
from bats of most species could be cloned and sequenced using
degenerate PCR primer sets, a strategy that has been used for
other species (132). Once the relevant gene sequences are
known for bats of a given species, real-time PCR assays could
be developed. In conjunction with cell culture studies, it should
be possible to characterize bat immune responses to challenge
with viral antigens. Bacterial artiﬁcial chromosome libraries
are available for the little brown bat and the greater horseshoe
bat, a species closely related to the Chinese horseshoe bat
(Rhinolophus sinicus), a host for SARS-CoV-like virus (84;
http://bacpac.chori.org/libraries.php). These resources may be
particularly valuable for rapidly identifying immune response
or cytokine genes of interest by using human or mouse hybrid-
ization probes.
Immune Evasion and Virus Persistence
Viruses must evade the host immune response for a time
sufﬁcient to allow transmission to other susceptible hosts or to
establish persistent infection. The strategies employed by vi-
ruses are numerous and target both the innate and adaptive
phases of the immune response. Some commonly employed
evasion strategies include virus-encoded immune-modulating
cytokines, decoy soluble cytokine receptors, inhibitors of apop-
tosis and cellular signaling, inhibitors of antigen processing,
and T-cell antagonists (2, 3, 18, 61, 70, 79, 87, 104, 150, 152).
To persist, viruses must also become biochemically adapted, so
that they can replicate without severely compromising the
host’s survival.
Some viruses, including SARS-CoV, elicit an immune re-
sponse in the nonreservoir host that may contribute to pathol-
ogy (75, 148, 157) while apparently, at least for SARS viruses,
not causing immunopathology in the reservoir. Elucidating the
immune responses in reservoir hosts that determine the bal-
ance between virus persistence and immunopathology could
contribute to our understanding of viral pathogenesis in hu-
mans and reveal potential targets for therapeutic intervention.
Some paramyxoviruses, including Nipah and Hendra viruses,
encode V proteins that bind to signal transducer and activator
of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2 proteins of host cells to
block both alpha/beta and gamma interferon responses (122).
How the viral proteins might affect potential interferon re-
sponses to virus infections in bats is unknown. Possibly the V
proteins play a role in viral persistence and evasion of the
immune response. Addressing these important issues regard-
ing the pathophysiology of viral infections in bats will require
the development of infection models for reservoir species of
each zoonotic virus.
With regard to bats, there is evidence that “healthy bats” can

BATS AND THE EMERGENCE OF VIRUSES
541

----- Page 12 (native) -----
be asymptomatically infected with rabies virus. In nonlethal
rabies infections produced in Mexican free-tailed bats, individ-
uals surviving infection do not have virus in the brain or saliva.
In one experimental study of free-tailed bats inoculated with
salivary gland tissues from naturally infected bats, the incuba-
tion periods were 24 to 125 days, but one asymptomatic bat
sacriﬁced at the end of the study had rabies virus in the brain,
salivary glands, and other organs (11). Incubation periods for
rabies virus are certainly highly variable in bats, and persis-
tence of virus in hibernating bats has been suggested as serving
a viral reservoir function (143). A carrier state for rabies virus
has also been suggested by experimental and observational
studies among dogs in Ethiopia (48).
Discovery of Emerging Viruses in Wildlife
It is, perhaps, instructive that viruses of the families
Paramyxoviridae, Filoviridae, Bornaviridae, and Rhabdoviridae
are phylogenetically related and have been grouped in a single
order, the Mononegavirales (120). There are at least 250 rec-
ognized viruses in this order, including some that infect hu-
mans, other primates, livestock, birds, dogs, seals, ﬁsh, crabs,
mosquitoes, ticks, amoebae, plants, or bats. If there is an un-
recognized tendency for bats and viruses to be associated,
viruses of this order would be prime targets for beginning the
search.
Essentially every living life form investigated has been shown
to host viruses, and bats are no exception. However, it is rea-
sonable to query the roles of viruses of bats. What role, for
example, does a fruit-eating bat play in the life cycle of a
human or livestock pathogen? If human and livestock infec-
tions from bats simply are host-switching phenomena, why
have these viruses not been recognized previously, and why
have they emerged now? Are these events the results of eco-
logic alterations, such as impingement of human activities on
heretofore virgin areas, consequences of global climate
change, or the product of improved surveillance activities co-
incident with the technical advances in diagnostic capabilities
required to identify heretofore undescribed zoonotic viruses?
Are viruses of bats symbionts, parasites, or commensals? Is
pathogenicity for humans and livestock simply a freak occur-
rence? Perhaps these emerging bat viruses are naturally trans-
mitted by arthropods or by other potential vectors that have
not been examined. Surely a fatal infection in a host is not in
the long-term best interest of the virus. Might fruit-eating bats
transmit viruses to or from plants? How? Are insectivorous
bats intermediate hosts between insects and vertebrates (or
plants)? Are fruiting events part of periodic ampliﬁcation cy-
cles of viruses from frugivorous bats to wildlife and humans, as
suggested by Dobson (42)? Childs summarized the processes
by which zoonotic viruses are transmitted (29). He noted the
rarity of surveillance for wildlife diseases or infections and
suggested that such studies usually are outbreak-driven, i.e.,
after an epidemic of a newly recognized virus has emerged.
Outbreaks of Hendra virus, Nipah virus, Menangle virus,
SARS-CoV-like viruses of bats, and European bat lyssavirus 1
(108) have not been recognized more than once or a few times.
Are transmissions between bats and other vertebrates infre-
quent, incidental spillover events? Do many of the 66 viruses
listed in Table 2 represent fortuitous, irrelevant events, or have
we detected only the tip of the iceberg? Do bats differ from
other mammals in their ability to clear viral infections? Does
the persistence of asymptomatic viral infections in bats indicate
that bats are an important reservoir for the wide variety of
viruses in nature? Is the prevalence of RNA viruses in persis-
tent infections in bats indicative of a defect in host resistance
or viral clearance mechanisms, such as interferon or interferon-
responsive genes that lead to clearance of RNA viruses from
other vertebrates? There is some urgency to explore these impor-
tant questions.
There is no reason to believe that bats are different from
other mammals with regard to species speciﬁcity of host sus-
ceptibility to virus diseases, nonuniform persistence of viral
infections, or mechanisms of virus shedding, so that such in-
vestigations likely do not require development of new assay
systems or diagnostic concepts. Additional research is needed
to determine the roles played by bats of various species in the
natural histories of the viruses for which bats can serve as
hosts.
One or more of the 66 viruses listed in Table 2 have been
isolated from bats of 74 species. As well, viruses have been
isolated from bats not identiﬁed further than to genus level and
from four unidentiﬁed bats. Some viruses have been isolated
from bats of as few as 1 species and one from as many as 14.
Clearly, bat handlers, people entering bat habitat areas, and
people who usually think in noninfectious disease terms re-
garding various studies of the bats themselves should take
necessary precautions to avoid exposing themselves to recog-
nized and unrecognized viruses and to other human pathogens
which the bats may harbor.
