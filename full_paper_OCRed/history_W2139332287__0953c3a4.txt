Anewgenreofwritingandmodeofresearchhasarrivedontheanthropological
stage: multispecies ethnography. Creatures previously appearing on the margins
of anthropology—as part of the landscape, as food for humans, as symbols—have
been pressed into the foreground in recent ethnographies. Animals, plants, fungi,
and microbes once conﬁned in anthropological accounts to the realm of zoe or
“bare life”—that which is killable—have started to appear alongside humans in the
realm of bios, with legibly biographical and political lives (cf. Agamben 1998). Amid
apocalyptic tales about environmental destruction (Harding 2010), anthropologists
are beginning to ﬁnd modest examples of biocultural hope—writing of insect love
(Rafﬂes 2010), of delectable mushrooms that ﬂourish in the aftermath of ecological
destruction (Tsing, for the Matsutake Worlds Research Group 2009), and of
microbial cultures enlivening the politics and value of food (Paxson 2008).
Multispecies ethnographers are studying the host of organisms whose lives and
deaths are linked to human social worlds. A project allied with Eduardo Kohn’s
“anthropology of life”—“an anthropology that is not just conﬁned to the human but
is concerned with the effects of our entanglements with other kinds of living selves”
(2007:4)—multispecies ethnography centers on how a multitude of organisms’
livelihoods shape and are shaped by political, economic, and cultural forces. Such
ethnography also followsSusanLeighStar,whosuggests“itisbothmoreanalytically

interesting and more politically just to begin with the question, cui bono? than to
begin with a celebration of the fact of human/non-human mingling” (1991:43).
The adjective “multispecies” already travels in biological and ecological re-
search worlds, referring to patterns of multispecies grazing, the coconstruction
of niches, and wildlife management (e.g., de Ruiter et al. 2005). What can it
do—what is it doing—in anthropology? Essays in this issue of Cultural Anthropology
offer some answers. The present essay locates the discussion within contemporary
debates about the “human”; in the history of anthropologies of animals, plants, and
other organisms; and with respect to conceptual questions about the deﬁnition of
“culture” and “species.”
“Becomings”—new kinds of relations emerging from nonhierarchical al-
liances, symbiotic attachments, and the mingling of creative agents (cf. Deleuze
and Guattari 1987:241–242)—abound in this chronicle of the emergence of
multispecies ethnography, and in the essays in this collection. “The idea of be-
coming transforms types into events, objects into actions,” writes contributor
Celia Lowe (this issue). The work of Donna Haraway provides one key start-
ing point for the “species turn” in anthropology: “If we appreciate the foolish-
ness of human exceptionalism,” she writes in When Species Meet, “then we know
that becoming is always becoming with—in a contact zone where the outcome,
where who is in the world, is at stake” (2008:244). Departing from Deleuze
and Guattari, whose ideas about “becoming animal” Haraway has critiqued for
misogyny, fear of aging, and an incuriosity about actual animals (2008:28–30),
multispecies ethnographers are studying contact zones where lines separating na-
ture from culture have broken down, where encounters between Homo sapiens
and other beings generate mutual ecologies and coproduced niches (Fuentes this
issue).
Multispecies ethnography has emerged with the activity of a swarm, a network
with no center to dictate order, populated by “a multitude of different creative
agents” (Hardt and Negri 2004:92). The Multispecies Salon—a series of panels,
round tables, and events in art galleries held at the Annual Meetings of the American
Anthropological Association (in 2006, 2008, and 2010)—was one place, among
many others, where this swarm alighted. The salon became a “para-site” (Marcus
2000)—a paraethnographic ﬁeld site where anthropologists and their interlocutors
came together to discuss matters of common concern (see Figure 1, a poster for
the 2008 event).1 Art served as a companion and catalyst practice for thinking
through and against nature–culture dichotomies (see also Kac 2007; da Costa and
Philip 2008).2 In this essay, we interweave an introduction of essays in this issue

MULTISPECIES ETHNOGRAPHY
FIGURE 1. “The Bodyguard for the Golden Helmeted Honeyeater.” The bodyguard, a poster
child for the Multispecies Salon, is a lively ﬁction made out of silicone by Australian sculptor
Patricia Piccinini. This fantastic creature was invented to protect a real organism—the golden
helmeted honeyeater, a small colorful bird of Victoria, Australia, whose breeding population
consists of just 15 pairs. Piccinini describes this creature as “genetically engineered” with large
teeth that have a dual function: “He will protect [the honeyeater] from exotic predators, and he
has powerful jaws that allow him to bite into trees, to provide the birds with sap” (2004). These
teeth are also a reminder that animals are not just good to think with, or play with, but that they
might bite. This potentially dangerous humanoid ﬁgure illustrates the lively potentials and
deadly consequences, the high stakes in the mix, when species meet. Donna Haraway, who
presented a paper about Piccinini at the Multispecies Salon in 2008, suggests that her sculptures
are “unsettling but oddly familiar critters who turn out to be simultaneously near kin and alien
colonists” (2007). Piccinini’s art mixes science ﬁction and fact, illuminating actual
naturalcultural problems in Australia as well as possible solutions. Moving past the “soporiﬁc
seductions of a return to Eden [and] the palpitating frisson of a jeremiad warning of the coming
technological Apocalypse” (Haraway 2007), Piccinini’s work embodies a mandate to protect
endangered organisms, while offering an opportunity for reﬂecting on the ambivalent nature of
the technoscientiﬁc interventions that have been mobilized to save them.

of Cultural Anthropology with a theoretical discussion and with gleanings from this
para-site.
WRITING CULTURE IN THE ANTHROPOCENE
Anthropos—the ethical and reasoning being that Enlightenment Europeans
conjured as their inheritance from classical Greece (Herzfeld 2002)—has been the
subject of renewed attention among anthropologists. In its classical articulation,
Michael M. J. Fischer reminds us, anthropos was an entity sited between the divine
and bestial, a being that self-reﬂexively fashioned itself as a member of the polis
(2009:xv–xvi). After Foucault, anthropos has also become a ﬁgure fashioned by
the modern sciences of life, labor, and language—that is, by biology, political
economy, and linguistics (see Rabinow 2003, 2008). And in the contemporary
moment, what counts as living, working, and communicating are under radical
revision in the biosciences.3 In this context, anthropologists have begun to ask:
What is anthropos becoming?
Attentiontoanthroposhasgeneratedmoreinstabilityinconceptionsof“ethics”
and “culture” than it has directed attention to anything like a changing organic
“human nature.”4 Such a displacement of foundational discourse about biology
indexes a conviction among many cultural anthropologists that anthropology has
outgrown its U.S. four-ﬁeld form (cultural, biological, linguistic, and archae-
ological) and that the sciences of human biology have little to say to cultural
analysis. Dan Segal and Sylvia Yanagisako’s 2005 collection, Unwrapping the Sacred
Bundle: Reﬂections on the Disciplining of Anthropology, is just one text calling for cul-
tural anthropologists to unbind themselves from the objects and epistemologies
of biological anthropology. That text can also be read as an echo of the 1990s
“science wars”—debates about what mix of empiricism and interpretation ought
ground positive knowledge claims, and about who has the authority to make that
call (see Fujimura 1998). Segal and Yanagisako’s book was one result of heated
debates that took place in anthropology in the United States at the end of the
20th century, resulting in sometimes stark institutional divides—splits of depart-
ments into cultural and biological wings, or into interpretative and evolutionist
sections.
Even as fault lines in the discipline have widened, something new has begun
to emerge. Ethnographers are exploring naturalcultural borderlands and situating
their work within ecological concerns. They have involved themselves with an array
of organisms and ecologies, and have been open to the methodological challenges
these present. The work presented here, in this special issue, is exemplary.

MULTISPECIES ETHNOGRAPHY
Such work also illustrates how concerns in cultural anthropology overlap
with concerns in different but companion communities and intellectual niches.
Atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen and biologist Eugene Stoermer coined the
term Anthropocene to describe a new epoch in Earth’s history. In their view, a key
transformation in the life of the planet began some two hundred years ago, around
the time the steam engine was invented, when human activity “gradually grew into
a signiﬁcant geological, morphological force” (2000:17). Crutzen and Stoermer
argue that the Holocene, the geological epoch that began about 12,000 years ago,
has now phased into the Anthropocene. In this frame of reference, anthropos has
become an ambivalent ﬁgure, possessed of an agency scaled up to embrace—
and endanger—the whole planet. Humans have come widely to be regarded as
the primary agents driving climate change, mass extinctions, and the large-scale
destruction of ecological communities (cf. Masco 2004 on the “mutant ecologies”
created by nuclear testing). With this in mind, Deborah Bird Rose has recently
called for “writing in the anthropocene,” petitioning for renewed attention to
“situated connectivities that bind us into multi-species communities” (2009:87).
Multispecies ethnography involves writing culture in the anthropocene, attending
to the remaking of anthropos as well as its companion and stranger species on planet
Earth.
THE SPECIES TURN: ROOTS AND FUTURES
Exploring ways of bringing other species (and intellectual modes) back into
anthropology, multispecies ethnographers have found inspiration in the work of
scholars who helped found the discipline. Studies of animals have a long lineage in
anthropology, traveling back canonically to texts such as Lewis Henry Morgan’s
1868 The American Beaver and His Works. Here, Morgan studied the “acquired
knowledge” of lodge, dam, and canal building transmitted among beavers. Drawing
parallels between the engineering knowledge of people and of beavers, one among
many species of what he thought of as clever animal “mutes,” Morgan articulated an
argument for animal rights: “The present attitude of man toward the mutes is not
such, in all respects, as beﬁts his superior wisdom. We deny them all rights, and
ravage their ranks with wanton and unmerciful cruelty” (1868:281–282; and see
Feeley-Harnik 2001). In the late 19th century, at a moment when anthropology
was a ﬁeld of natural history, scholars like Morgan worked across boundaries later
secured against trafﬁc between the social and natural sciences.
Many of Morgan’s contemporaries engaged in what might be regarded as
comparative multispecies ethnology. Take, for example, naturalist A. T. de

CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY 25:4
Rochebrune, who in 1882 launched the ﬁeld of “ethnographic conchology,” a sub-
ject devoted to studying “the use of Mollusks [snails, clams, and octopus], whether
as objects of adornment or industry, or as substances used for food, dyeing, textile
fabrics, etc. among ancient and modern peoples” (Clement 1998:175). Among a
diversity of related interdisciplinary formations emerging in the late 19th century,
only a few, like ethnobotany and ethnozoology, have endured.
Studies of hunting, husbandry, and the role of animals in systems of totem and
taboofeaturedprominentlyinclassic20th-centuryethnographies.Evans-Pritchard,
Douglas, L´evi-Strauss, Radcliffe-Brown, and Leach are only the best known and
most inﬂuential in this literature (see also Ingold 1988; Tambiah 1969). Such work
grew out of long-standing interests in anthropology with systems of animal and
natural classiﬁcation (e.g., Bulmer 1967). Gregory Bateson—who worked across
thedisciplinesofanthropology,psychology,linguistics,andepistemology—offered
a cybernetic framework for understanding human–animal interactions, and wrote
famously of human–dolphin communication (Bateson 1972, 1979). His theory
of play and fantasy, and criteria of mental processes, broke down essentialized
differences between human and nonhuman minds (Bateson 1972).
In the decades after midcentury, many cultural anthropologists worked to
denaturalize intrahuman differences established along the lines of gender, race,
class, nation, caste, sexuality, and ability. In the late 20th century, developments
within the discipline of biology itself began to trouble assumptions that biotic
“nature” could be a stable foundation on which forms of human social and cultural
life might be built. The “facts of life” became highly malleable. Feminist scholars
of kinship, gender, and reproductive technology—for example, Emily Martin
(1987), Verena Stolcke, (1988), Marilyn Strathern (1992a, 1992b), Cori Hayden
(1995),LynnMorganandMeredithMichaels(1999),RaynaRapp(1999),andSarah
Franklin (2001)—were among the ﬁrst to realize that the discipline should turn
its attention to the making and remaking of biological knowledge and substance,
particularlyasitimpingedonnotionsofrelatedness.Thenewbiologiestransformed
ideas about race, too. The “biology” of race migrated from population genetics to
genomes, both reinforcing and undoing earlier understandings of human taxonomy
(Fullwiley 2007; Haraway 1995; Montoya 2007; Nelson 2008; Reardon 2005;
TallBear 2007). Anthropologists also attended to how new kinds of identities built
around genetic and genomic knowledge and conditions—what Paul Rabinow in
1992 called “biosocialities”—came to organize novel political and social afﬁliations
and communities (see Epstein 2008; Gibbon and Novas 2008; P´alsson 2007; Rose
2007; Taussig et al. 2003).

MULTISPECIES ETHNOGRAPHY
With the turn of the 21st century, Homo sapiens reappeared on the disciplinary
stage, along with animal others and familiars. In conversations turning less to
etymological reexaminations of ancient Greek or to continental philosophy, critical
evolutionary and molecular anthropologists began to reexamine issues of race and
gender in the context of new genetic technologies (e.g., Marks 2002, 2008).
Lively conversations between biological and cultural anthropologists resulted in
edited collections such as Genetic Nature/Culture (Goodman et al. 2003; for an
earlier meditation on such convergence, see Ingold 1990), which featured chapters
about gender, genealogy, race, and animals. Genetic Nature/Culture zeroed in on the
changing contours of the “nature” wriggling within whatever “human nature” might
mean now. The book’s various authors—especially those writing on apes, sheep,
and dogs—would not be surprised to hear Anna Tsing’s suggestion that, “Human
nature is an interspecies relationship” (Tsing n.d.; see Haraway 2008:19).5
New brands of animal anthropology twist the old, as more anthropologists
have become curious about the lives of animals in labs, on farms, in agricultural
production, as food, in rapidly changing ecosystems (for one review of recent
work, see Fischer 2009:141–153). As a new generation of anthropologists began
to attend to the remaking of human nature, others began to follow related logics
of remaking at work in nonhuman natures. Celia Lowe (2006) described how the
macaque, introduced to Indonesia’s Togean Islands in the 1920s, was transformed
from a feral “hybrid swarm” into to an “endemic species” by Indonesian scien-
tists savvy at engaging with powerful international conservation agendas. Sarah
Franklin’s Dolly Mixtures (2007) brought old questions about kinship into dialogue
with high-tech animal husbandry. Examining the technique of somatic cell nuclear
transfer, famously used to produce the lamb clone Dolly, Franklin demonstrated
biotech’s potential to reorder what might count as the “nature” of reproduction
and genealogy. Hugh Rafﬂes, in his writings on insects, innovatively fused ento-
mology with anthropology as he wrote genre-crossing meditations on butterﬂy
collecting, cricket ﬁghting, bee language, and the racialization of lice (Rafﬂes 2001,
2010). Eduardo Kohn, taking up questions of cross-species communication, ar-
gued for a new theory of semiosis; his ethnography among the Runa in the Amazon
sought to account for the communicative worlds Runa shared with their dogs
(2007).
The new animal anthropology joined established, ongoing conversations
in human–animal studies in the pages of such journals as Animals and Society
and Anthrozo¨os and in the work of such historians as Harriet Ritvo, author of
The Animal Estate (1989) and The Platypus and the Mermaid (1998), and Virginia

DeJohn Anderson, author of Creatures of Empire: How Domestic Animals Transformed
Early America (2004). As Molly Mullin pointed out in her 2002 review essay,
“Animals and Anthropology,” the fusion of animal studies with anthropology
would now ask anthropologists to revisit long-standing interests in evolution and
domestication but also to craft new tools for understanding such phenomena as
transgenic creatures and patented organisms (cf. Fuentes and Wolfe 2002; Ritvo
2002; see also Where the Wild Things Are Now: Domestication Reconsidered, edited by
Cassidy and Mullin 2007). No longer, it seems, were animals simply “windows
and mirrors” (Mullin 1999) into and of symbolic concerns (see, canonically, Leach
1964. See also Shanklin 1985). Their material entanglements increasingly require
anthropologists to engage with biotic materiality and process, apprehended both
through everyday experience and through technoscience (see also Benson 2010;
Vivanco 2001). Donna Haraway’s 2008 When Species Meet gathered up this emerging
sensibility, arguing that animals are not just “good to think” (as L´evi-Strauss had
it), or more instrumentally, “good to eat” (as Marvin Harris countered), but were
also entities, and agents, “to live with.”6
That “living with,” of course, takes a variety of forms. It might be as companion
species (Haraway 2003). It might be as “unloved others” (Rose and van Dooren
in press). It might be as creatures with simultaneously parallel and entangled
biographies, like the primates studied by ethnoprimatologists. In the words of
Erin Riley, ethnoprimatology offers grounds for “reconciliation of biological and
cultural anthropology” through the study of interconnections amongst primates—
among Homo sapiens and other species (2006:75). Using the ethno- preﬁx, suggests
primatologist Agust´ın Fuentes, “marks the inclusion of anthropogenic elements,
including social, economic, and political histories and contexts as a core component
of primatological inquiry” (this issue). In an allied move, Haraway (2010) has
lately experimented with another arrangement of preﬁxes, calling the new animal
anthropology “zooethnography.”
“Living with” may mean deep engagement with particular animals. Alterna-
tively, as Matei Candea suggests about human–meerkat relations, it may mean
cultivating a mutual “detachment” as a mode of interaction—or, better, a mode
of “interpatience” (Candea 2010). Animals may act as anthropologists themselves,
studying the behavior of humans who feed, shepherd, and breed them (Paxson
2010). In zoos, captive apes have come to know the personalities and hierarchies
of their human keepers as well as they know their own kin and kind. In some cases,
human keepers even share antianxiety medications with the captive allo-primates
in their care (Braitman 2010).

MULTISPECIES ETHNOGRAPHY
Animals may fuse, refuse, and confuse nature–culture categories and on-
tologies. Among the Siberian Yukaghirs, humans, animals, and spirits are seen
as “endless mimetic doubles of one another” (Willerslev 2007; see also Nadasdy
2007). In a related mix of natureculture, Eduardo Viveiros de Castro draws on
ethnographic studies of Amerindian cosmologies in the Amazon to advance a no-
tion of “perspectival multinaturalism” (1998). He posits that humans, animals, and
spirits participate in the same world, although with different sensory apparati, with
the effect of generating only partially overlapping ontologies. If mononaturalism,
the prevailing ontology of Occidental science was “blown to pieces” by multinatu-
ralism, as Bruno Latour has it, then a multispecies approach to ethnography must
engage with the alterworlds of other beings. Following Viveiros de Castro, we
might accept Latour’s claim that “No one can bear to be just one culture ‘among
others’ watched with interest and indifference by the gaze of the naturalizers.
Reality is once again becoming the issue at stake” (2002:21).
Displacing studies of animal behavior used by social conservatives and so-
ciobiologists to naturalize autocratic and militaristic ideologies, Anna Tsing began
studying mushrooms to imagine a human nature that shifted historically along with
varied webs of interspecies dependence. Searching familiar places in the parklands
of northern California for mushrooms—looking for the orange folds of chanterelles
or the warm mufﬁns of king boletes—she discovered a world of mutually ﬂour-
ishing companions (Tsing n.d.). Aspiring to mimic the “rhizomic sociality” of
mushrooms, Tsing formed the Matsutake Worlds Research Group—an ethno-
graphic research team centered on matsutake, an aromatic gourmet mushroom
in the genus Tricholoma, a “species cluster.” Following the matsutake mushroom
through commodity chains in Europe, North America, and East Asia, this group
has experimented with new modes of collaborative ethnographic research while
studying scale-making and multispecies relations (Choy et al. 2009:380).
If we accept Tsing’s notion that “human nature is an interspecies relationship”
(n.d.; see also Haraway 2008:19), plants must be key players, too. One anchor
point for plant ethnography is ethnobotany, the study of styles of knowledge and
belief about plant life. Ethnobotanists and ethnobiologists have long been engaged
in joint research and publication efforts with people often relegated in other studies
to the role of ethnographic object (see Hunn 2007). Although some ethnobotanists
have sometimes exploited the “savage slot,” garnering media attention and pro-
fessional accolades for accounts of their “wild odysseys” with shamans (Plotkin
1993), others have assumed the role of public intellectuals drawing on insights
from cultural theory and ecology alike. Take, for example, the diverse corpus of
553

CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY 25:4
writing by Gary Nabhan on topics ranging from the roots of plants and people
along Arab American routes (2008) to the natural and cultural history of tequila on
U.S.–Mexico borderlands (Valenzuela-Zapata and Nabhan 2004). A new genera-
tion of ethnobotanists sees plants as social beings with agentive efﬁcacy. Virginia
Nazarea, in a 2006 Annual Review of Anthropology article about ethnobotany, writes:
“Recent developments in anthropological thought, particularly in the areas of sen-
sory memory or sensuous scholarship, marginality and mimesis, and landscape or
place offer a way out of misplaced essentialism, which demands strict adherence to
what does or does not count as biodiversity, knowledge, and memory” (2006:319).
Cori Hayden, in her study of bioprospecting in Mexico (2003) brings ethnobotany
ﬁrmly into the territory of political economy. Classic work on “plant teachers” in
anthropology has also recently been taken up in poststructuralist literary theory
(e.g., Doyle 2005, 2006).
With critical assessments of biodiversity discourse emerging from anthro-
pologies of science and from political ecology (e.g., Helmreich 2009; Lowe 2006;
West 2006), several scholars also began venturing away from animals and plants—
toward microbiota that rarely ﬁgure in discussions of biodiversity. Astrid Schrader
(2010) examines Pﬁesteria piscicida, a “phantom dinoﬂagellate” with a “ghostly un-
decidablity,” its agency only revealed by the massive ﬁsh kills it leaves in its
wake. Ethnographers are turning to microbes as social agents, on land, in the sea,
and in food (Dunn 2007; Helmreich 2009; Hird 2009; Paxson 2008). Even as
“the human” moves a bit to the edge of this work, the discussion remains legibly
anthropological—addressing questions of relatedness, exchange, governmentality,
and signiﬁcation. Paul Rabinow’s biosociality, Marilyn Strathern’s call to think “after
nature,” and various permutations of biocapital (Franklin and Lock 2003; Helmreich
2008; Sunder Rajan 2006) all lend themselves to multispecies inquiry.
Ethnographic studies of biocapital, biodiversity, and biosociality must all grap-
plewithproblemsofrepresentation.Howcanorshouldordoanthropologistsspeak
with and for nonhuman others? That question pages back to a canonical anthropo-
logical problematic articulated by Arjun Appadurai in Cultural Anthropology: “The
problem of voice (‘speaking for’ and ‘speaking to’) intersects with the problem of
place (speaking ‘from’ and speaking ‘of’)” (1988:17). Appadurai writes, “anthro-
pology survives by its claim to capture other places (and other voices) through its
special brand of ventriloquism. It is this claim that needs constant examination”
(1988:20). This reﬂexive examination should be redoubled when anthropologists
speak with biologists, nature lovers, or land managers—and for the species that
these agents, along with anthropologists, represent.

MULTISPECIES ETHNOGRAPHY
The work of Bruno Latour, who employed the phrase “nature-culture” to
articulate relations among humans and nonhumans that sustain modernity, has
been inﬂuential in thinking about such reﬂexivity (1993:7–11; and see Latour 1988
on microbes). Latour sees parallels between politicians who speak for other people
and biologists who speak for nonhumans (2004). Latour’s model for bringing
democracy to nature involves consensus building among human “spokespeople.”
But questioning the ability of nonhumans to hold their representatives accountable,
one might ask, “Can the non-human speak?” (cf. Spivak 1988; Mitchell 2002)—
although this is not the right question either. “Non-human is like non-white,” Susan
Leigh Star said in a response to a presentation about the Multispecies Salon, “it
implies a lack of something” (personal communication, September 12, 2008). The
category of “non-human” is also grounded in human exceptionalism—the foolish
notion that Haraway pushes us to move beyond.
An awareness of new microbiological facts of life suggests that fundamen-
tal boundaries between organisms, between species, are blurrier than previously
thought. A close look at human skins, guts, and genomes reveals that human beings
are a consortium of sorts, a medley of microbial becomings (Haraway 2008:31).
By the late 20th century, biologists were beginning to ﬁnd that viruses and other
microbes transfer genes across species lines as well as higher level taxonomic cat-
egories like families or even phyla—spreading genetic material laterally among
living creatures, rather than vertically down generations (Helmreich 2003). Evo-
lutionary theorists began to rethink their mappings of interspecies relationships,
challenging prevailing Darwinian orthodoxies about linear descent (Margulis and
Sagan 2002; see also Hird 2009). In the words of Giles Deleuze and Felix Guattari:
“Evolutionary schemas would no longer follow models of arborescent descent go-
ing from the least to the most differentiated, but instead a rhizome. . . . We form
a rhizome with our viruses, or rather our viruses cause us to form a rhizome with
other animals” (1987:11).
A rhizomorphic zeitgeist inﬂects many branches of biology. And anthropology
hasbeeninfected,too.FusingMargulis’s symbiogenesis(thecomingintobeingofnew
creatures through symbiosis) and Foucault’s biopolitics, Stefan Helmreich (2009)
suggests that we think of the governance of entangled living things as a question of
symbiopolitics. A symbiopolitical multispecies ethnography turns out to have a good
deal in common with the traveling methods of multisited ethnography (Marcus
1995). With animals, invasive plants, and microbes on the move, anthropological
accounts ramify across places and spaces, entangling bodies, polities, and ecologies.
Multispecies ethnographers, like multisited ethnographers, are starting to follow

genes, cells, and organisms across landscapes and seascapes, tracing how elements
of Homo sapiens are creating becomings in the bodies of other species, and vice versa
(Hayward and Kelley 2010).
Constantly morphing visions of natureculture have long been the humdrum
stuff of bioengineering. Witness creatures such as OncoMouseTM, a patented
organism hosting human breast cancer genes (Haraway 1997). As naturalcultural
hybrids proliferate, Homo, the conventional subject of anthropological concern,
is no longer a clearly bounded biological subject. A multitude of literal human
chimera—genetic hybrids named after the ﬁgural ﬁre-breathing monsters of Greek
mythology with a lion’s head, a goat’s body, and a serpent’s tail—are turning
human beings and becomings into things that are increasingly difﬁcult to con-
tain. Human genes are being incorporated into a diversity of common laboratory
organisms—from rats and mice, to fruit ﬂies, to Escherichia coli, to nematode
worms.
The Multispecies Salon, the art exhibit staged in parallel with the AAA Annual
Meeting of 2008, was one opportunity for anthropologists to revisit how human
nature is now enmeshed with interspecies, transgenic, and multinatural worlds.
Art forms have proved good to think with about “living with” in a multispecies
world.
THE MULTISPECIES SALON
The Multispecies Salon art exhibit in the PLAySPACE Gallery of the California
College of Arts—alongside the 2008 AAA Annual Meeting—explored how artists
might be allies in thinking about biological beings and becomings in anthropology.

that was expressly experimental, “We are conducting a biodiversity survey of sorts
that will bring together organisms living in the greater San Francisco Bay Area. We
seek to represent creatures that are thriving in our yards, greenhouses, laboratories,
and aquariums as well as those that are failing to ﬂourish in our built landscapes”
(Kirksey and Johnston 2008). This survey turned up a multitude of agents—
endangered species of butterﬂies, rodents, and frogs—that already occupied the
realm of “bios” and enjoyed the ambiguous beneﬁts of biographical or political
lives in human worlds. It also yielded parasites, weeds, and laboratory animals—
creatures usually conﬁned to the realm of “zoe,” “bare life” that is killable. “One
of the strengths of the show is that it is a big overturning of the pot,” observed
Todd Gilens, an ecoartist who participated in the Multispecies Salon, showcasing
plans to wrap San Francisco buses with images of the Salt Marsh Harvest Mouse.

“You’ve gathered some things into a bowl called a ‘gallery’ and you’ve turned it
over. And things are mixing, categories are mixing.” The Multispecies Salon sought
to blur the boundaries between bioart and ecoart—two traditions already difﬁcult
to distinguish, not least because the categories themselves are contested (see Catts
and Zurr 2008:134–135).
Bioart is a “tactical biopolitics” (da Costa and Philip 2008:xviii). If Foucault
understood biopolitics as disciplinary forms for optimization, coercion, and control
of biology, then bioart is organized around attempts to detour, derail, or expose
these regimes of domination and systems for managing “life.” In 2000, bioart
burst into the popular imagination when Eduardo Kac announced the birth of
Alba, a rabbit that glowed green as a result of transgenically introduced jellyﬁsh
genes. These same genes illuminated one submission to the Multispecies Salon—a
series of paintings with transgenic E. coli bacteria on Petri dishes by French artist
Andre Brodyk. Many bioartworks, like Brodyk’s, are novel organisms that have
been created by artists or are dependent on humans for their continued survival
(Bureaud 2002:39; Zurr 2004:402; see Kac and Ronell 2007).
In a foundational text of the ecoart movement, Suzi Gablik writes: “The
ecological perspective connects art to its integrative role in the larger whole and
the web of relationships in which art exists” (1991:7). Ecoart takes “art for non-
humans seriously” (Bower 2009). In contrast to the living media used in bioart,
ecoart usually involves the traditional materials of sculpture, photography, and
painting. At the salon, work by professional bioartists and ecoartists appeared
alongside submissions from other participants—biologists, anthropologists, and
schoolchildren. The curators extended Joseph Beuys’s famous decree—“You are
all artists”—beyond human realms (cf. Bishop 2004:61). For anthropologists accus-
tomed to thinking about the agency of nonhumans (cf. Gell 1998; Latour 1993), it
was hardly surprising to ﬁnd living microbes, insects, and plants framed as creative
agents.

Experimental organisms, fruit ﬂies, and pictures of transgenic E. coli bacteria shared

children—creatures such as the golden toad of Monte Verde, Costa Rica, now
presumed extinct. The piece asked, “Have You Seen Me?”

CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY 25:4
FIGURE 2. Frederic Landmann’s “Wolbachia and Drosophila.”
Previous collaborations between anthropologists and artists (i.e., Marcus
and Calzadilla 2005) set the stage for transforming the art gallery into a site
where the common interests and preoccupations of multiple disciplines could
be explored. The gallery became a “para-ethnographic” site, a place where the
boundaries between academic conference and traditional ﬁeld site dissolved, gen-
erating conversation among anthropologists, biological scientists, and artists—
encounters that generated ethnographic data and ethnographic analysis at the same
time (cf. Marcus 2000; http://www.culanth.org/?q=node). The salon also hosted
living parasites: symbiotic associations as well as human pathogens (see Figure 2).
In French, parasite is polysemic, signifying “noise, static, or interference” in addi-
tion to a biological or social freeloader (Serres 2007). With 17 artists exhibiting
and swarms of anthropologists passing through, there was an abundance of noise,
interference, and crosstalk.
If the curators of the Multispecies Salon began by gathering together art and
artifacts to illustrate conditions of life in the anthropocene—exploring the question
of which species ﬂourish and which fail in the shadows of human worlds—the
profusion of subvisible organisms in the gallery left them wondering if the notion
of “the anthropocene” was perhaps a bit too anthropocentric. Frederic Landmann,
a postdoctoral scholar at the University of California, Santa Cruz, displayed vials
from his lab ﬁlled with live fruit ﬂies (Drosophila sp.), yeast to feed the ﬂies,
and thousands if not millions of Wolbachia bacteria living in the cells of the ﬂies.
“Long before our time, there were the insects,” Hugh Rafﬂes reminds us. “For
as long as we’ve been here, they’ve been here too. Wherever we’ve traveled,
they’ve been there too. . . . Not just deeply present in the world but deeply there,
558

creating it, too” (2010:3). Wolbachia are old, too, having been around at least
100 million years (Stouthamer et al. 1999). They are one of the most abundant
microbes on earth—infecting over 75 percent of studied invertebrates, including
spiders, mites, crustaceans, nematode worms, and insects ( Jeyaprakash and Hoy
2000).
Eva Hayward (this issue) suggests that “inverts”—the kind without backbones
as well as the sort who transpose gender roles—interrupt heteronomativity. Wol-
bachia are agents of invert becomings, with millennia of experience in forming
what Hayward and Lindsay Kelley call “tranimals”—enmeshments of trans and
animals, critters that cross or queer normative sex and gender conﬁgurations. Be-
cause Wolbachia bacteria are too big to ﬁt into the sperm of invertebrates, they
are usually only transmitted from invert mothers to children. If classic biomedical
textbooks contain tales about human sperm and eggs that naturalize patriarchical
stereotypes about productive men and wasteful women (Martin 1991), the Wol-
bachia literature refracts related tales through the bacteria’s imagined point of view:
“Because males are not transmitters of such symbionts, they are ‘waste’ from the
perspective of the symbiont” (Stouthamer et al. 1999:82). To spread in subse-
quent generations, Wolbachia transform the bodies and the reproductive dynamics
of their invert hosts. When female wasps of certain species are infected with the
bacterium they become parthenogenic—meaning that they no longer need to have
sex with males to produce viable offspring. Wolbachia perform a sex-bending trick
in some crustaceans and in at least one insect species—changing genetic males into
reproductively viable females. Regarding Wolbachia as a tranimal-forming agent is
not a naturalizing move but an attempt to trace sexualized alterities and alternative
imaginaries (Hayward this issue), uncanny microbial becomings at work all around
H. sapiens.
Playing with popular anxiety surrounding microbial becomings, performance
artist Caitlin Berrigan created a series of sentimental objects in an attempt to
“befriend a virus.” Growing tired of the rhetoric of war commonly used by health
care workers to describe her illness, hepatitis C, Berrigan, who carries the virus
in her blood, performed what she called a “nurturing gesture,” at the Multispecies
Salon. Drawing her own blood, she offered it to a dandelion plant as a nitrogen-rich
fertilizer: “Blood containing human pathogens is still a good fertilizer for plants,”
she argued, “I can give to the dandelions what would be a danger to any human”
(see Figure 3). Enacting a relation of shared suffering, of mutual care and violence
(cf. Haraway 2008), Berrigan told audience members that she takes dandelion root
as medicine to help her liver cope with viral infections.

CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY 25:4
FIGURE 3. “Lifecycle of a Common Weed” by Caitlin Berrigan.
Noting that the recipient of her nurturing gesture is regarded as a “weed,”
Berrigan worked to give the dandelion biographical and political life (bios), elevating
it from the realm of bare life. “The dandelion actually has a lot to offer us even
though they grow everywhere, and are killed with herbicides,” she later told us
(see also Berrigan 2009). Berrigan’s art and personal medical regimen might be
understood as a “microbiopolitical” intervention, calling attention to how living
with microorganisms (in this case, a pathogenic virus) is caught up in discourses
about how humans ought live with one another (Paxson 2008:16). Appropriating
tools of biotechnology and syncretic medical traditions, she worked to create a
symbolic cycle of nutrients in urban environments, on a micro local scale, in
opposition to dominant institutionalized practices and global commodity chains
(cf. Paxson 2008:40).
Marnia Johnston’s “Twins,” is a ceramic piece, a chimerical pair of grubs with
wings (see Figure 4). Only adult insects have wings. Their juvenile forms, larvae,
do not. “Humans are acquiring adult characteristics, such as breasts, at an early age,”
Johnston told us. “Endocrine disrupting chemicals, like Bovine Growth Hormone,”
she continued, “are working on the bodies of humans and multiple other species.
I want people to think about how our chemical dependencies change us and the
world we live in.”

MULTISPECIES ETHNOGRAPHY
FIGURE 4. “Twins” by Marnia Johnston.
The Twins are littermates of Paranoia Bugs, ceramic sculptures that Johnston
began to make in 2005 after the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan. “The paranoia of
the U.S. was a kind of swarm,” Johnston said, “where fears fed and bred upon
each other, crawling and overtaking everything in their path.” This terrifying spirit
infects the military strategists, mathematicians, and entomologists who informed
Jake Kosek’s ethnographic account of drone aircraft in the hills of Afghanistan
and Pakistan, programmed with algorithms modeled on bee behavior to adopt
“swarming” tactics (Kosek this issue). Perhaps these ﬂying insectoid-machines, and
the Paranoia Bugs, embody the nightmares of Hugh Rafﬂes: “There is the nightmare
of fecundity and the nightmare of the multitude. . . . There is the nightmare of
knowing and the nightmare of non-recognition. . . . Nightmare begets nightmare.
Swarm begets swarm. Dreams beget dreams. Terror begets terror” (2010:201–
203).
Johnston gave paranoia a dark body and spindly legs. Initially, she held back,
not completing a full swarm, just making a single Paranoia Bug. She began to dabble
in bioart—to learn new laboratory techniques so that she could start working with
living matter. This dabbling attracted the attention of “Mills Gurman” (name
changed by request), an employee of Monitor 360 who was working for the CIA
to study “biohacking” and bioterrorism. Johnston agreed to meet with Gurman,
hoping to convince him that her artistic practice, and bioart in general, was benign,
posing no public health risks. “The meeting left me wanting to know more about
561

----- Page 19 (native) -----
CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY 25:4
what he would report back to the CIA,” Johnston said, “especially now that the
government had my name and associated me with a possible threat.” This attention
fromaCIAcontractemployee,andlaterfromtheFBIWeaponsofMassDestruction
Directorate, had a chilling effect on Johnston’s bioart. She turned back to her old
ceramic projects—kneading clay, carefully attending the kiln, layering on colorful
glaze, creating a multitude of ﬁgurines that embodied her concerns. The paranoia
of U.S. government agents gave the Paranoia Bugs new life. The second generation
of the bugs had a ﬂeshier appearance and were less steady on their legs than
the prototype. “They are stem cells gone wild,” she told us. “Some have mouths
and cannibalize their brethren, others have wings but still can’t ﬂy. Fearing their
own kin, and suspicious of the motives of others, Paranoia Bugs are always on
the lookout—to make sure they don’t get eaten.” Johnston’s sculpture gave a
material form to anxiety, frustration, and fear—fusing the speculative fabulations
of biocapitalism with specters of bioterror.
ReappropriatingthetacticofswarmingfromU.S.governmentsecurityforces,
Johnston has helped form a curatorial collective that will stage a new art exhibit,
the Multispecies Salon 3: SWARM, alongside the 2010 AAA Annual Meeting in
New Orleans. The Paranoia Bugs will make an appearance in the mix with work
by local artists and community activists—for example, who will do a “seed bomb”
installation piece throughout the city, inviting visitors to the art gallery to engage in
“guerilla bioremediation” by throwing these bombs over fences to seed toxic sites
that have been abandoned by owners and regulatory agencies. If the Multispecies
Salon started as a biodiversity survey, an attempt to account for the multiple beings
living along with humans in the city of San Francisco, it was opened to a multitude
of agents who created a becoming that was increasingly difﬁcult to contain.
MULTISPECIES BEINGS AND BECOMINGS
The reader may worry that the above survey, taking us from humans to animals
to plants to fungi to microbes, risks reinstalling the “human” as a central reference
point, and even offers a kind of great chain of being as an organizing principle. We
agree with Eduardo Kohn that,
If we take otherness to be the privileged vantage from which we defamiliarize
our “nature,” we risk making our forays into the nonhuman a search for
ever-stranger positions from which to carry out this project. Nature begins
to function like an “exotic” culture. The goal in multi-species ethnography
should not just be to give voice, agency or subjectivity to the nonhuman—to

recognize them as others, visible in their difference—but to force us to
radically rethink these categories of our analysis as they pertain to all beings”
[personal communication, March 29, 2010]
It is for this reason that, in what follows, we and the other authors take aim at a
hidden ontology in the frame of “multispecies”—that of “species.” Wrangling with
species (and genus, family, order, class, phylum, kingdom, domain, when possible)
means that we need to take natural and cultural categories as we receive them and
try simultaneously to rethink and undo them.
Karl Marx saw human “species being” as essentially creative, essentially for-
ward looking. He contrasted human species being to the being of the bee, writing
“whatdistinguishestheworstarchitectfromthebestofbeesisthis,thatthearchitect
raises his structure in imagination before he erects it in reality” (Marx 1990:284).
Here, human species being is a sort of being that has consciousness of itself as a
species. Marx’s species being, then, is a variety of anthropos in the classical sense,
a being that can reﬂect on itself. But this “species” phrasing, read a century and
a half after Darwin, also opens it up to a materialist query from the evolutionary
biological sciences.
The gender speciﬁc binomial Homo sapiens, after Linnaeus’s foundational 18th-
century nomenclature, translates as “man the knowing,” placing thinking at the core
of human nature. Thinking becomes the measure next to which other species are
to be judged. There have been attempts to reroute this common sense. Terms such
as Homo faber (“man the maker”—championed by Karl Marx, Henri Bergson, and
Hannah Arendt) and Homo ludens (“playing man”—articulated by Johan Huizinga
[1949] in his 1938 book of that title) offer differently inﬂected species beings.7
Valences of homo from Latin that have fallen out of fashion in the last several
hundred years of popular and technical usage—“fellow” or “creature” (Wade and
Kidd 1997)—might be revived even as the stability of Homo sapiens, the biological
species, is being unmade by bioengineering.
If anthropology has in the last 25 years accelerated its querying of what we
might mean by “culture” (Abu-Lughod 1991; Clifford 1986; Gupta and Ferguson
1992), authors in this issue take aim at “species” as a grounding concept for
articulating biological difference and similarity. This project has a precedent in the
philosophy of biology, which has examined the coherence and limits of the species
concept (see, e.g., Dupr´e 1992). In When Species Meet, Haraway notes that the very
notion of species itself is unsteady, “inherently oxymoronic,” referring at once to
logical types as well as to that which is relentlessly speciﬁc.
563

----- Page 21 (native) -----
CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY 25:4
How have the authors assembled in this issue’s thematic cluster—originating
as members of the swarm that materialized at the Multispecies Salon—enacted
multispecies ethnography?
Eva Hayward’s ethnography of cup coral encounters at the Long Marine Labo-
ratory in Santa Cruz, California, advances the notion that species are “impressions”;
they carry the traces—structural, behavioral, and textural—of those others with
whom they have shared past contiguities and intimacies, in both evolutionary and
biographical time. Reporting on her work as a lay technician working with Bal-
anophyllia elegans, Hayward writes of the sensuous interplay of vision and touch
in her encounters with coral, and she develops an analytic she calls ﬁngeryeyes to
articulate the palpability of cross-species encounter. She is interested in the overlay
of sensoriums and the inter- and intrachange of sensations across species bound-
aries. Taking the Long Marine Lab’s research into coral sex and reproduction as
one focus, Hayward employs feminist and queer theory to think anew about how
corals generate generations.
Agust´ın Fuentes is also interested in what happens when species overlap—
not with respect so much to their sensoria as with respect to their positions in
ecologies. In his essay, Fuentes elaborates on the concept of “niche construction”
to understand the copresence of humans and Rhesus macaques at Balinese temples.
Fuentes suggests that the niche concept can be rearticulated to understand natural-
cultural contact zones (cf. Haraway 2008)—incorporating present-day ecological
interactions as well as historical, political, and economic forces. Fuentes deploys a
hybrid methodological tool kit, using the observational techniques of primatology
in conjunction with ethnographic practice to study the lives of monkeys at Balinese
temples—creatures that subsist on ritual offerings of food, handouts from tourists,
as well as plants and animals acquired from riverine forest corridors between tem-
ples. He reproduces wry comments from Balinese tour guides, who see themselves
as occupying a similar social niche as the monkeys in the geopolitical economy:
waiting for tourists to arrive.
Staying in Indonesia, Celia Lowe takes as her subject the avian inﬂuenza
virus H5N1, examining how in the early 2000s this “quasi-species” generated fear
and speculation about its possible becomings, locally, nationally, internationally,
globally. Using the technical notion of a “cloud” of viral genomes as a rhetorical
device to understand the proliferation of plans and narratives around H5N1, Lowe
enfolds humans, chickens, and viruses into an account of an event that never quite
came to be—a global pandemic of avian inﬂuenza. Gaining access to the security

MULTISPECIES ETHNOGRAPHY
in the enclaves of the urban poor, she reports on the gassing, burning, and burying
alive of chickens, during what some have called “a global avian genocide.”
Finally—and staying with the theme of security—Jake Kosek zeroes in on the
bees Marx used as a foil for humans, examining the militarization of honeybees and
the use of “the swarm” as a metaphor by the U.S. military in the “war on terror.”
Groundinghisethnographicpracticeinhishobbyofbeekeeping,Kosekfollowsbees
and mathematical swarming algorithms from public debates in the U.S. Congress to
DARPA-funded projects at the Los Alamos National Laboratory to the battleﬁelds
of Afghanistan. Engaging with clouds of ideas about swarming, Kosek departs from
literal descriptions of bee behavior to wrangle with critical theory on the topic
(by Deleuze and Guattari, among others) to describe how swarms have found a
place to ﬂourish within the modern militarized state. Teasing out the mimetic
logic of Pentagon ofﬁcials, Kosek ﬁnds abundant evidence of terrifying animal
becomings. The U.S. government is assembling legions of insectoid robots and
commanding soldiers to embody the form and tactics of the swarm. Like Hayward,
Kosek centers his attention on the sensory differences his subject organisms exhibit
from humans—and he shows how these are being exploited and rebuilt for human
purposes. A multisensory approach—grappling with unfamiliar sensoriums, with
different kinds of touch, smell, taste, and vision—characterizes this multispecies
ethnography.
All this work suggests that Homo sapiens faber ludens has, as Haraway puts
it, “never been human,” or at least never only.8 Humans have always been what
Haraway calls “messmates,” and what Sarah Franklin (2008) calls “mixmates.”
How then might multispecies ethnography mix with cultural anthropology more
broadly?
Cultural Anthropology was chartered to bring anthropology into dialogue with
articulations of the culture concept issuing from other ﬁelds and disciplines, notably
cultural studies (see Marcus 1986). The early decades of the journal were keenly
interested,too,inliterarytheory,postmodernism,feminism,andinprovincializing
dominant traditions. Multispecies ethnography asks cultural anthropologists to
reengage with biological anthropology and to take a look at eco- and bioart (as
both allied practices and objects of study)—to craft new genres of naturalcultural
criticism. Multispecies ethnographers follow Dan Segal’s observation that “whether
or not anthropology passes muster as ‘real science,’ it today operates from a
position in the sciences broadly construed, and, beyond this, that this is something
we must learn to negotiate if we wish to participate in more fruitful dialogues
with other disciplines and diverse publics” (2001:452; see also Fischer 2007).
565

----- Page 23 (native) -----
CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY 25:4
Multispecies ethnography is a site for such dialogue. It encourages anthropologists
to ask, ethnographically, what happens when Homo sapiens and its interspecies,
multispecies, and quasi-species familiars, burrow into the biology that animates
anthropos?
ABSTRACT
Anthropologists have been committed, at least since Franz Boas, to investigating re-
lationships between nature and culture. At the dawn of the 21st century, this endur-
ing interest was inﬂected with some new twists. An emergent cohort of “multispecies
ethnographers” began to place a fresh emphasis on the subjectivity and agency of organ-
isms whose lives are entangled with humans. Multispecies ethnography emerged at the
intersection of three interdisciplinary strands of inquiry: environmental studies, science
and technology studies (STS), and animal studies. Departing from classically ethnobio-
logical subjects, useful plants and charismatic animals, multispecies ethnographers also
brought understudied organisms—such as insects, fungi, and microbes—into anthro-
pological conversations. Anthropologists gathered together at the Multispecies Salon,
an art exhibit, where the boundaries of an emerging interdiscipline were probed amidst
a collection of living organisms, artifacts from the biological sciences, and surprising
biopolitical interventions.

The phrase “Multispecies Salon” emerged over dinner conversation among Rosa Ficek, Heather
Swanson, and Eben Kirksey in 2006 when they were all graduate students at the University
of California (UC), Santa Cruz. Later that year, in conjunction with the AAA Annual Meeting
in San Jose, Eben Kirksey staged the ﬁrst Multispecies Salon at Oakes College with support
from the UC Santa Cruz Center for Cultural Studies and the Science Studies Cluster. The
Multispecies Salon 2 art exhibit was organized in 2008 by Eben Kirksey, Marnia Johnston, Craig
Schuetze, Patricia Alvarez, and Christopher Newman with funding from the National Science
Foundation (Award number 750722), the History of Consciousness Program of UC Santa Cruz,
the Anthropology Program at New College of Florida, and Anthropology at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. Seventeen artists and intellectuals submitted work to the Multispecies
Salon art exhibit: Andre Brodyk, Traci Warkentin, Caitlin Berrigan, Carl Rettenmeyer, David
Edmunds, Denise King, Frederic Landmann, Jake Metcalf, Kamil Dawson, Kathy Gritt, Luke
Santore, Marnia Johnston, Patricia Piccinini, Rachel Mayeri, Ruth Wallen, Todd Gilens, and
Eben Kirksey. Other creative agents included Donna Haraway, Agust´ın Fuentes, Eben Kirksey,

One recent bioart show has centered on Deleuze and Guattari’s ideas about “becoming animal”
(Thompson 2005). Deleuze and Guattari distinguish individuated “Oedipal animals” from pack
animals that form a multiplicity and a becoming. “Anyone who likes cats or dogs is a fool,”
566

----- Page 24 (native) -----
MULTISPECIES ETHNOGRAPHY
they write. Deleuze and Guattari then celebrate the social forms of pack animals, like wolves,
that “grip every animal in a becoming” (1987:265). We join Donna Haraway in only going
halfway with Deleuze and Guattari. In the work of Deleuze and Guattari, Donna Haraway
writes, “patrilineal thinking, which sees all the world as a tree of ﬁliations ruled by genealogy
and identity, wars with rhizomatic thinking, which is open to nonhierarchical becomings”
(2008:28). “So far, so good. . . . But the wolf/dog opposition is not funny. . . . I am not sure I
can ﬁnd in philosophy a clearer display of misogyny, fear of aging, incuriosity about animals, and
horror at the ordinariness of ﬂesh, here covered by the alibi of an anti-Oedipal and anticapitalist
project” (Haraway 2008:28–30). We side with Haraway in rejecting Deleuze and Guattari’s
wolf–dogopposition.Still,wejoinDeleuzeandGuattariindepartingfromindividuatedsubjects

(2009:114), an“oddjobword,”ora“coveringlabelfortheparadoxicalambiguity” of “that which

Compare Clifford Geertz’s 1962 essay, “The Growth of Culture and the Evolution of Mind,”
which recounts human evolution from Australopithecines forward. In that tale, human nature—
deﬁned as culture, argued to be the result of increased brain size and complexiﬁcation—is
more biogeographically driven than it is by “other” species. Compare, too, to Tsing’s claim,
Helmreich’s suggestion at the end of Alien Ocean, an ethnography of new imaginations of the
relation of ocean microbes to human life, that we are witnessing “the saturation of human nature
by other natures” (2009:284).

For innovative uses of animals to “think with,” see Haraway 1989 (see Strum and Fedigan 2000
for a response), Tsing 1995 (on bees and national identity), Maurer 2000 (on ﬁsh and money),
and Subramaniam 2001 (on “invasive species” and xenophobia).

Tom Boellstorff’s Homo cyber (2008) posits that “the human” is an entity characterized by its
fashioning as virtual—as always potential. Such forms as Gyno sapien or the more linguistically
analogous Femina sapien, although vanishingly rare, play with and query the gender speciﬁcity
here.

Helmreich (2009:284) suggests the possibility that we are becoming Homo alienus.
