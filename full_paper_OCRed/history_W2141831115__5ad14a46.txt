The human genome contains many thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). While several studies have demon-
strated compelling biological and disease roles for individual examples, analytical and experimental approaches to in-
vestigate these genes have been hampered by the lack of comprehensive lncRNA annotation. Here, we present and
analyze the most complete human lncRNA annotation to date, produced by the GENCODE consortium within the
framework of the ENCODE project and comprising 9277 manually annotated genes producing 14,880 transcripts. Our
analyses indicate that lncRNAs are generated through pathways similar to that of protein-coding genes, with similar
histone-modification profiles, splicing signals, and exon/intron lengths. In contrast to protein-coding genes, however,
lncRNAs display a striking bias toward two-exon transcripts, they are predominantly localized in the chromatin and
nucleus, and a fraction appear to be preferentially processed into small RNAs. They are under stronger selective pressure
than neutrally evolving sequences—particularly in their promoter regions, which display levels of selection comparable to
protein-coding genes. Importantly, about one-third seem to have arisen within the primate lineage. Comprehensive
analysis of their expression in multiple human organs and brain regions shows that lncRNAs are generally lower
expressed than protein-coding genes, and display more tissue-specific expression patterns, with a large fraction of tissue-
specific lncRNAs expressed in the brain. Expression correlation analysis indicates that lncRNAs show particularly striking
positive correlation with the expression of antisense coding genes. This GENCODE annotation represents a valuable
resource for future studies of lncRNAs.

The cellular economy is transacted by both proteins and non-
protein-coding RNAs. Historically, proteins (and the messenger
RNAs that encode them) have tended to dominate our view of the
cell and its genome due to their abundance and to the relative ease
with which protein-coding genes, and their gene products, can be
identified and studied. However, in recent years this paradigm has
been undermined as new technologies have provided accelerating
depths of RNA sequencing. We now appreciate the pervasive tran-
scription of numerous long and small RNA species in mammalian
genomes, forcing us to radically reinterpret our understanding of
the genome (Carninci et al. 2005; ENCODE Project Consortium
2007). In particular, attention is now shifting toward one of the
most poorly understood, yet most common RNA species: long
noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs).
The discovery and study of lncRNAs is of major relevance to
human biology and disease since they represent an extensive,
largely unexplored, and functional component of the genome
(Mattick 2009; Ponting et al. 2009). While enough lncRNAs have
been implicated in human disease to justify major investment in
genome-wide screens for new lncRNA candidates, such studies are
hampered by the current lack of lncRNA annotation. Thus, there is

a need for the curation of high-quality catalogs of lncRNAs and
information on the tissues in which they are expressed. Similar
information for protein-coding genes has long been available.
The FANTOM consortium pioneered the genome-wide discovery
of lncRNAs in mouse in the early 2000s, publishing a set of 34,030
lncRNAs based on cDNA sequencing (Maeda et al. 2006). Only
recently was a catalog of 5446 human lncRNAs created, based on
a computational pipeline of sequenced cDNAs by Jia et al. (2010).
Meanwhile the large intergenic noncoding RNAs (‘‘lincRNAs’’)
(Guttman et al. 2009; Khalil et al. 2009), discovered through epi-
genetic annotation of human and mouse genomes, represent a
useful set of RNAs, but omit the many lncRNAs that reside within or
overlap protein-coding loci, and do not explicitly provide lncRNA
gene structures. Most recently, Cabili et al. (2011) created a catalog
of 4662 human intergenic lncRNAs by combining partially com-
plete GENCODE annotations and computational predictions based
on RNA-seq data. Similarly for lncRNA expression data, efforts are
underway to create databases and microarray expression platforms
for mouse lncRNAs (Dinger et al. 2009), but no equivalent data has
been available in human.
In fact, the GENCODE consortium within the ENCODE project
has for several years been manually annotating a comprehensive set
of human lncRNAs. Early releases of the GENCODE annotation have
already been used to investigate the potential function of these
transcripts (Ørom et al. 2010). Version 7 (v7) of GENCODE (Harrow
et al. 2012), the reference annotation used for the ENCODE analysis
(The ENCODE Project Consortium 2012) has introduced a number of
biotypes to specifically define different classes of lncRNAs, consoli-
dating a GENCODE lncRNA set. Here, we report on the annotation of
this set, which includes 14,880 manually curated and evidence-based
transcripts. We integrate these lncRNAs with other transcriptome
and epigenome data sets produced within the ENCODE project and
elsewhere. We show that lncRNAs have canonical gene structures
and histone modifications. They tend to be under weaker evolu-
tionary constraint than coding genes, and to be expressed at lower
levels. As a class, lncRNAs are preferentially enriched in the chro-
matin and nucleus of the cell. We present expression maps of these
transcripts throughout the human body and brain. Overall, the
GENCODE lncRNA catalog represents a valuable resource for future
studies on the role of lncRNAs in human biology.
Results
Identification and initial categorization of lncRNAs
in the GENCODE gene annotation
The lncRNA catalog described in this study represents a subset of
the manually annotated GENCODE human gene annotation cat-
alog (Harrow et al. 2012; www.gencodegenes.org/) that consists of
15,512 transcripts grouped in 9640 gene loci. Thus, the GENCODE
lncRNA annotation constitutes the largest manually curated
catalog of human lncRNAs. These lncRNAs can been further
reclassified into the following locus biotypes based on their
location with respect to protein-coding genes:
1. Antisense RNAs, which have transcripts that intersect any exon
of a protein-coding locus on the opposite strand, or published
evidence of antisense regulation of a coding gene.
2. LincRNA are transcripts that are intergenic noncoding RNA loci
with a length >200 bp.
3. Sense overlapping transcripts contain a coding gene within an
intron on the same strand.
4. Sense intronic transcripts reside within introns of a coding
gene, but do not intersect any exons.
5. Processed transcripts do not contain an open reading frame
(ORF) and cannot be placed in any of the other categories.
We have applied this categorization automatically to the
GENCODE 7 lncRNA data set, resulting in the following distribu-
tion: antisense (3233), lincRNA (5094), sense intronic (378), and
processed transcript (935). Since the exact boundaries of protein-
coding loci are difficult to predict due to unannotated alternatively
spliced transcripts, we have defined the boundaries of protein-
coding genes to be 5 kb upstream of the start codon and 30 kb
downstream from the stop codon (Fig. 1A).
For the analysis presented in this study, we removed tran-
scripts shorter than 200 bp (n = 198) and also those containing at
least one exon intersecting a protein-coding exon on the same strand
(n = 594). This results in a final set of 14,880 transcripts originating
from 9277 loci. We then subclassified this set of GENCODE lncRNAs
biotypes according to their localization with respect to the nearest
known protein transcripts (exonic, intronic, overlapping) (Fig. 1B).
The majority of lncRNA transcripts (9518) do not intersect with any
protein-coding genes and were therefore considered as intergenic (Fig.
1B) and analogous to the ‘‘lincRNAs’’ that were defined by chromatin
signatures (Khalil et al. 2009). The remaining 5362 lncRNAs that in-
tersect protein-coding transcripts in some way were further catego-
rized by those covering protein-coding exons (2411), introns (2784),
or overlapping protein-coding (i.e., where the protein-coding tran-
script lies within an intron of the lncRNA) (167) (Fig. 1B). Note that
transcripts intersecting protein-coding exons on the same strand were
previously omitted from this analysis.
The GENCODE lncRNA data set is larger than other available
lncRNA data sets, and it shows limited intersect with them. A total

lncRNAdb (Amaral et al. 2011) are represented in GENCODE
lncRNAs. We checked the same-strand overlap against recent
lncRNA catalogs: GENCODE v7 lncRNAs contain 30% of Jia et al.
(2010) lncRNAs, 33% of Cabili et al. (2011) (stringent) lincRNAs,
39% of Cabili et al. (2011) (all) lincRNAs, and 12% of vlincs
(Supplemental Fig. S1; Kapranov et al. 2010). We also examined
the overlap with the Khalil et al. (2009) set of human lincRNAs;
however, we could not perform an accurate intersection analysis
due to their lack of strand information. Manual curation of the
remaining genes in lncRNAdb reveals many that intersect with
protein-coding genes and/or small RNAs. A full characterization of
the GENCODE v7 lncRNA set can be downloaded as Supplemental
Table S1 from: http://big.crg.cat/bioinformatics_and_genomics/
lncrna_data.
LncRNAs do not show evidence of protein-coding potential
There is some evidence that transcripts thought to be purely non-
coding lncRNAs may in fact encode proteins, in small or otherwise
unrecognized ORFs (Chooniedass-Kothari et al. 2004; Kondo et al.
2010; Dinger et al. 2011). To assess the protein-coding status of the
present lncRNAs catalog, we first used the program GeneID (Blanco
et al. 2007) to (1) measure the protein-coding potential and (2) find
the longest possible ORF in each lncRNA sequence. We compared
the results in the set of GENCODE lncRNAs with (1) known protein-
coding transcripts, (2) experimentally validated lncRNAs (such as
XIST, H19), and (3) a set of ‘‘decoy’’ lncRNAs, obtained by mapping
lncRNA gene structures randomly onto the genome (see Methods).
Figure 2A shows that lncRNAs have a similar coding potential and
contain ORFs similar in length to known lncRNAs and decoy
lncRNA (Supplemental Fig. S2A), but very different from protein-
coding genes (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney: P < 2.2 3 1016). Thus, at
least at a sequence level, the lncRNA catalog does not appear to have
ORFs of higher quality than expected of random sequences.
On the other hand, investigation of mass spectrometry (MS)
conducted within the ENCODE project on nine compartment-
specific proteome samples from GM12878 and K562 cell lines
identified 350 peptides that matched the GENCODE lncRNA set
(out of a total of 79,333 peptides). These were found in only 111
lncRNA transcripts from 69 distinct loci. Among those 69 loci, only
12 have multiple in-frame peptides, providing particularly strong
evidence of translation. Overall, these results, reported in detail
(Ba´nfai et al. 2012), support the conclusion that most GENCODE
lncRNAs lack any protein-coding potential.
The majority of GENCODE lncRNAs are independent
transcriptional units
Annotation of lncRNAs is made challenging by the low expression
levels of these transcripts, which may lead to fragmentary anno-
tation and poor definition of the transcript boundaries. Concerns
have also been raised as to whether lncRNAs are independent
transcripts, or whether they are simply unrecognized extensions of
neighboring protein-coding transcripts (van Bakel et al. 2010). To
test whether this is the case for the GENCODE lncRNAs, we used
various high-throughput sequencing data produced in the context
of the ENCODE project to search for evidence of physical linkage
of lncRNA transcripts and neighboring protein-coding genes. We
first used CAGE tags obtained in 12 experiments to search for ex-
perimental validation of the annotated start sites of lncRNAs
(Djebali et al. 2012), and found support (at least one tag within
6100 bp from the annotated 59 end in at least one experiment) for
15% of lncRNA transcripts, compared with 55% of protein-coding
transcripts (Supplemental Table S3). This could, in principle, sug-
gest that lncRNA promoters are poorly annotated. However, this
analysis is confounded by the lower expression level of lncRNAs
compared with protein-coding genes. To control for gene ex-
pression, we computed the fraction of genes that have CAGE tags
by binning the genes according to expression levels. When con-
trolling for gene expression, we find that for each expression bin,
protein-coding genes have ;15% greater CAGE tag coverage
compared with lncRNAs (Fig. 2B). We then sought to further de-
lineate the boundaries of lncRNA transcripts using RNA paired-
end ditags (PETs), a method in which the extreme 59 and 39 re-
gions of RNA molecules are sequenced (Ng et al. 2005). Using PETs
obtained in 16 experiments (Djebali et al. 2012), we found sup-
port simultaneously at the 39 and 59 end for 10% of the lncRNAs,
compared with 39% of protein-coding genes (Supplemental Table
S3). When binning for gene expression levels, we found a similar

behavior as for CAGE, with ;15% greater PET coverage for protein-
coding transcripts in each expression bin (Supplemental Fig.
S2B). We also tested for the presence of known poly(A) motifs in
the 39 end (100 bp surrounding the annotated transcription termi-
nation site) of GENCODE lncRNAs in comparison with protein-
coding transcripts (see Methods). Overall, 39% of LncRNAs tran-
scripts contain at least one of the six most common poly(A)
motifs, compared with 51% observed for coding transcripts. This
difference may be explained by the higher proportion of non-
poly(A) lncRNAs compared with protein-coding transcripts (Sup-
plemental Table S3; Supplemental Fig. S14B). In contrast, the pro-
portion of decoy lncRNAs containing poly(A) motifs at the 39end
was 26%.
Finally, we used RNA-seq paired-end reads (PE reads) from
three ENCODE cell lines and three compartments (Djebali et al.
2012) to assess potential ‘‘bridging’’ between lncRNAs and protein-
coding transcripts, i.e., cases where the lncRNA and the coding
transcript appear to originate from a single RNA molecule. We rea-
soned that if lncRNA transcripts are indeed independent, then we
should observe no more PE reads connecting them to neighboring
protein-coding genes than between protein-coding genes them-
selves. We found that 9% of lncRNAs are connected by at least one
PE read in at least one experiment (see Methods). In principle, while
this could suggest that many lncRNAs are unannotated UTRs from
protein-coding genes, the proportion of protein-coding genes that
are connected by PE reads to neighboring protein-coding genes is
actually larger at 17% (Supplemental Table S3). Binning for ex-
pression level, we found that this increased connectivity between
protein-coding genes is not an artifact of their greater expression
(Supplemental Fig. S2C). We also investigated whether all of the
lncRNA classes had equally strong experimental support for their 59
and 39 annotations (Supplemental Table S8). This showed that sense
intronic transcripts had generally weaker support for their anno-
tated start and end sites, suggesting that the quality of their anno-
tation is weaker in general than the other lncRNA subclasses. In
summary, these data suggest that the majority of lncRNAs are un-
likely to represent unannotated extensions of neighboring protein-
coding genes.
LncRNAs have unusual exonic structure, but exhibit standard
canonical splice site signals, and alternative splicing
Most LncRNAs are spliced (98%), but they show a striking ten-
dency to have only two exons (42% of lncRNA transcripts have
only two exons compared with 6% of protein-coding genes) (Fig
3A). This does not seem to be an artifact of lncRNA’s low expres-
sion, or poor annotation, since even subsets with experimental
support for their 59 and 39 boundaries exhibit this effect (Fig. 3A).
While lncRNA exons are slightly longer than those of protein-
coding transcripts (medians 149 and 132 bp, respectively; t-test,
P-value = 0.00014), introns from lncRNAs are longer that those
from protein-coding genes (medians 2280 bp and 1602 bp, re-
spectively: t-test, P-value <2.2 3 1016) (Fig. 3B). Because they have
less exons, overall lncRNA transcripts are shorter than protein-
coding (median 592 bp compared with 2453bp for protein-coding
transcript; t-test, P-value <2.2 3 1016) (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, the
longest lncRNA is NEAT1, a single-exon lincRNA of 22.7 kb, which
was recently shown to be necessary for the formation of nuclear
paraspeckles (Sunwoo et al. 2009). In addition, >25% of lncRNA
genes show evidence of alternative splicing with at least two dif-
ferent transcript isoforms per gene locus (Fig. 3D). The most highly
spliced lncRNA gene is PCBP1-AS1 with 40 annotated isoforms.
This human lncRNA gene is situated at a complex locus with major
gene structure differences between human and mouse orthologs
(Supplemental Fig. S3).
The vast majority of lncRNA introns are flanked by canonical
splices sites (GT/AG), and we find no differences in splicing signal
usage compared with protein-coding genes (Supplemental Table S4;
Supplemental Fig. S4). Finally, we have also identified 11 lncRNAs
U12 introns (Alioto 2007) within the lncRNA catalog, of which
eight belong to intergenic lncRNAs (lincRNAs) and three are in
antisense of protein-coding introns.
Human lncRNAs are under weaker selective constraints
than protein-coding genes, and many are primate specific
Purifying selection of genomic sequence represents powerful evi-
dence for functionality and, thus, we sought to assess whether the
GENCODE lncRNAs have experienced such selection. We used the
precomputed, nucleotide-level calculations of evolutionary selec-
tion provided by the phastCons algorithm (Siepel et al. 2005). By
this measure, lncRNA exons are significantly more conserved than
neutrally evolving ancestral repeat (AR) sequences, albeit at lower
levels than protein-coding genes (Fig. 4A). These findings are in
agreement with studies of other lncRNA catalogs (Ponjavic et al.
2007; Guttman et al. 2009; Marques and Ponting 2009; Ørom et al.
2010). We also compared the sequence conservation of different
regions of lncRNA genes: promoters, exons, and introns (Fig. 4A).
In fact, lncRNA promoters are on average more conserved than
their exons, and almost as conserved as protein-coding gene pro-
moters, as observed in mouse lincRNAs (Guttman et al. 2009).
The relatively fast evolutionary change of lncRNAs reported
here depends on phastCons-based analysis and, therefore, on the
accuracy of an underlying multiple genome alignment (MGA). To
avoid potential underestimation of conservation of noncoding
sequence by this method, we completed this study with an
MGA-independent assessment of the transcripts’ conservation
across mammalian genomes. We systematically BLASTed human
lncRNAs against all available mammalian genomes, and sub-
sequently used exonerate (Slater and Birney 2005) to reconstruct
gene models on the genome sections yielding hits strong enough
to support the presence of a homologous gene (Fig. 4B). With this
method, ;30% of lncRNA transcripts (n = 4546) appear to be pri-
mate specific. Altogether, this high primate conservation explains
the large number of lncRNAs conserved in five species (2802) (Fig.
4C), and the derived clustering recapitulates well the most com-
monly accepted primate tree of life. A total of 0.7% (101) of tran-
scripts appear to be specific to the human lineage. A similar
number (134; 1.0%) is found reciprocally in all of the 18 species
analyzed here. This figure increases to 3.4% (n = 506) if we ignore
the two marsupials in the analysis, opossum and platypus. These
widely conserved transcripts show an average intronic size about
twice that of the full lncRNA set, whereas their exons are shorter.
We were interested in whether lncRNAs may belong to evo-
lutionarily related families. We clustered all the transcripts by
sequence similarity using BLASTClust (Altschul et al. 1990), iden-
tifying 194 families with between two and 96 members, and per-
cent identity between 49% and 100% (Supplemental Table S1). It is
worth noting that 138 out of 194 families contain only two mem-
bers, and only three families contain more than 10 members. This
may reflect a high turnover rate or the difficulty of effectively
aligning fast-evolving sequences. A more stringent analysis also
revealed that the majority of these families were defined by a de-
graded version of common repeats such as LINE, SINE, and LTRs

within the lncRNA sequence (Supplemental Fig. S5). Interestingly,
the multiple alignments revealed a high number of correlated po-
sitions (1100 in total; on average, five per kilobase of multiple se-
quence alignment) that may be interpreted as evidence of evolu-
tionary conservation of RNA secondary structures. It is also worth
pointing out that some of the families thus identified do not contain
any identifiable repeat sequence, while others contain conserved
structural elements. One such family is shown on Figure 4D along
with its predicted fold and 10 identified compensatory mutations
maintaining Watson-Crick base pairing, and clustered in the same
predicted loop structure.
Expressed lncRNAs have typical histone modifications
Histone modifications are known to play a role in the regulation of
gene expression (Barski et al. 2007) and have been successfully used
as a proxy for the identification of novel lncRNAs (Guttman et al.
2009). We investigated the chromatin signatures of the GENCODE
lncRNA genes and compared them with protein-coding genes based
on ChIP-seq data from eight cell lines and eight chromatin marks
(Ernst et al. 2011). We produced aggregate plots of ChIP-seq reads
(see Methods) for histone methylation and acetylation patterns
around TSSs (transcription start sites) of lncRNAs and coding tran-
scripts (Supplemental Fig. S6). To eliminate the confounding in-
fluence of transcriptionally silent lncRNAs, we analyzed only those
lncRNAs expressed in the same cell type where the histone modi-
fications were measured. LncRNA TSS histone profiles are similar to
those of protein-coding genes for several active histone marks
(H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3K27ac), but have slightly excess
levels of other marks associated with both silencing (H3K27me3)
and activity (H3K36me3). Chromatin marks are more pronounced
for the 2157 lncRNAs with 59-support (see previous section) than for
Figure 3.

the total set of lncRNAs—probably due to the higher expression of
the lncRNAs in this subset, and the greater precision of their 59
annotation. In summary, expressed lncRNAs have histone modifi-
cations indicative of actively regulated gene promoters.
Some lncRNAs may be post-processed into smaller RNAs,
particularly snoRNAs
Many lncRNAs may serve as precursors for functional small RNAs
(sRNA), with or without having intrinsic functionality them-
selves (Askarian-Amiri et al. 2011). To evaluate this for the present
lncRNA set, we compared their genomic position with small
RNAs on the same strand, as annotated by GENCODE (Harrow
et al. 2012). A total of 27% of all annotated small RNAs (tRNAs,
miRNAs, snRNAs, and snoRNAs) map within the genic bound-
aries of 7% of all protein-coding genes, while 5% of small RNAs
map within the boundaries of 4% of all lncRNAs. This does not
necessarily rule out a propensity for lncRNAs to host small RNAs
compared with protein-coding genes, because this analysis is
biased by the greater number and length of protein-coding
genes. To control for this, we computed the proportion of nu-
cleotides in lncRNAs that overlap different classes of small RNAs,
and compared it with similar data for protein-coding genes and
intergenic background. This revealed that lncRNA exons are en-
riched for all classes of small RNAs, with the exception of snRNAs,
compared with other genomic domains, including lncRNA in-
trons. Particularly striking is the enrichment for snoRNAs, which
are present in sixfold excess in lncRNA exons compared with
other genomic domains (Supplemental Fig. S7). Nevertheless, it is
important to note that, in absolute terms, more snoRNAs arise
from lncRNA introns compared with exons, due to the far greater
length of the former.
LncRNAs show lower and more tissue-specific expression than
protein-coding genes
We investigated the expression patterns of lncRNAs in a wide range
of human organs and cell lines using available RNA-seq data as well
as a custom lncRNA microarray. We were particularly interested in
understanding the magnitude of lncRNA expression, as well as its
degree of tissue specificity.
Using RNA-seq
We used RNA-seq data obtained in various human tissues by the
Illumina Human Body Map Project (HBM) (www.illumina.com;
ArrayExpress ID: E-MTAB-513). HBM reads were mapped using the
ENCODE RNA-seq pipeline (Djebali et al. 2012) and GENCODE
lncRNA transcripts were quantified, as RPKM (read per kilobase of
exon per million mapped reads) (Mortazavi et al. 2008), using the
FluxCapacitor (Montgomery et al. 2010). We computed the dis-
tribution of expression of lncRNAs and protein-coding genes
across the 16 tissues profiled in the HBM project (Fig. 5A). As
shown previously (Ravasi et al. 2006; Ørom et al. 2010), lncRNAs
show lower expression in all tissues compared with mRNAs, al-

though lncRNAs show relatively high expression in testis. LncRNAs
also show more tissue-specific patterns compared with protein-
coding genes, although this may be a result of their lower expression
levels and resultant false negative detection in some tissues when
applying strict cutoff of expression (Supplemental Fig. S8). The
majority (65%) of protein-coding genes were detected in all HBM
tissues compared with 11% of lncRNAs (21% of lncRNAs were not
be detected in any tissue, and 11% are only detected in a single tissue
using an RPKM threshold greater than 0.1) (Fig. 5B). Consistent with
this observation, we have also found that lncRNAs show higher
expression variability, measured as the coefficient of variation
across cell lines and tissues, than protein-coding genes (Supple-
mental Fig. S9).
Mapping lncRNA expression in the human body by custom microarray
To get a deeper picture of lncRNA expression throughout the hu-
man body, we developed a custom microarray platform capable
of quantifying the transcripts in the GENCODE lncRNA anno-
tation. The array was printed with multiple nonredundant 60-mer
oligonucleotides targeting 9747 lncRNA transcripts from the
GENCODE version 3c annotation. We hybridized this array with
human RNA from a range of sources: five common cell lines, of
which four are used by ENCODE; nine brain regions; 17 other
tissues from the adult body (Fig. 6A). The microarray results are
available in the Supplemental Data online. Overall, we detected
essentially all transcripts (99%) expressed in at least two cell types
and 29% in all 31 cell types using standard microarray analysis
(Supplemental Fig. S10). Using more stringent methods did not
substantially alter the numbers of lncRNAs detected (95% and
28%, respectively). In accordance with previous microarray studies
(Dinger et al. 2008) and RNA-seq (Fig. 5A), we found that lncRNAs
are generally far lower expressed than protein-coding genes
(Fig. 6B).
To gauge the reliability of the microarray platform, we per-
formed extensive comparison to RNA-seq for the four ENCODE
cell line samples that were analyzed using both methods. Com-
parison of the control protein-coding genes that were printed
on the microarray to the RNA-seq data showed a high correlation
of 0.6–0.7, consistent with other reports (Supplemental Fig. S11A;
Fu et al. 2009). However, for lncRNA expression, the concordance
between technology platforms was lower—with correlation co-
efficients from 0.24 to 0.31 (Supplemental Fig. S11B). This agrees
with previous studies showing that the correlation between RNA-
seq and microarrays is poor in genes that are either lowly (such as
lncRNAs) or highly expressed (Wang et al. 2009). Although manual
inspection of the correlation suggests that microarrays have lower
accuracy in quantitating the absolute expression levels of lncRNAs
compared with RNA-seq, it has to be noted that the microarray is
more sensitive in detecting whether a lncRNA is expressed or not,
compared with RNA-seq at the depth of sequencing in these ex-
periments (Supplemental Figs. S8, S10).
Using the expression data from lncRNAs, we could cluster
the 31 cell types and recover biologically meaningful relation-
ships between them, particularly separating the brain from other
tissues (Fig. 6C). Indeed, amongst the most differentially/expressed
lncRNAs, a brain-specific cluster accounts for ;40% (Fig. 6A).
Finally, we examined the expression profiles of various known
lncRNAs (Fig. 6D). As expected, the X chromosome-specific XIST
transcript is only detected in RNA samples from females. MIAT
(also known as Gomafu) and SOX2-OT have brain-specific ex-
pression, while H19 is highly expressed in the placenta.
Correlations of expression between lncRNAs/mRNAs genes
reveal potential subclasses of interactions
The issue of whether lncRNA expression correlates with either
neighboring (cis) or distal (trans) protein-coding genes has been
a matter of debate in recent studies (Ørom et al. 2010; Cabili et al.
2011). We next analyzed whether any nonrandom coexpression
patterns of lncRNA-mRNA exist in the ENCODE and HBM RNA-
seq data.
Trans-acting correlation of expression
In order to highlight possible interactions between lncRNA and
protein-coding genes, we computed all pairwise correlations be-
tween lncRNA and protein-coding genes (lncRNA-mRNA) using
expression values (RPKM) from the 16 Human Body Map tissues
(see Methods). The reliability of these correlations were estimated
based on comparison with three different sets: (1) correlations
of all-against-all protein-coding genes (mRNAs-mRNAs set), (2)
lncRNA-mRNA correlation profiles where the expression of the
coding genes were randomly shuffled (lncRNA-mRNA_Random)
and lncRNAs-lncRNAs correlations (Supplemental Table S5). Within
each of these data sets, every pairwise gene combination at a dis-
tance >1 Mb or involving interchromosomal elements were tested,
therefore representing trans-correlations of expression (Fig. 7A).
Overall, we observed that lncRNAs are more positively than nega-
tively correlated with protein-coding genes (12.1% vs. 0.2% with
Spearman coefficient rho (rs) >|0.5|, respectively, out of a total of
about 100 million trans-correlations tested) (Supplemental Table
S5). Yet, this tendency is also observed for correlations between
protein-coding genes themselves (12.0% vs. 0.6%, respectively).
However, lncRNA genes exhibit more extreme positive correlations
(rs > 0.9) with protein-coding genes (2.6%) than protein-coding
mRNAs with other mRNAs (1.3%) (Fig. 7A). This high proportion of
positive correlations is mainly due to tissue-specific lncRNAs for
which correlations of expression with lncRNAs or mRNAs only
expressed in the same tissue (artificially) lead to high positive cor-
relations. Two results support this hypothesis: (1) the higher fre-
quency of lncRNAs-lncRNAs with extreme positive correlations
(6.8%) compared with lncRNAs-mRNAs, and (2) the limited breadth
of expression for pairwise correlations having a high coefficient of
correlation (Fig. 7B). Indeed, when we removed tissue-specific genes
for the calculation of coexpression, one could observe that the
proportion of extreme positive correlations becomes significantly
less pronounced (Supplemental Fig. S12A).
Cis-acting correlation of expression
We next focused our attention on pairwise correlations of expres-
sion involving neighboring genes (Supplemental Table S5). Several
studies have demonstrated either positive (Kim et al. 2010; Ørom
et al. 2010) or negative (Brockdorff et al. 1992; Nagano et al. 2008)
regulation by intergenic lncRNAs (lincRNAs) of neighboring
protein-coding genes. We found more positive (rs > 0.5) and more
extreme positive (rs > 0.9) lncRNAs-mRNAs and mRNAs-mRNAs
correlations in cis than in trans (Supplemental Table S5). But, in
contrast to trans, we observed in cis more positive and more ex-
treme positive lncRNA-mRNA correlations than mRNA-mRNA
correlations (7.1% vs. 3.9%, of extreme positive correlations re-
spectively, both significantly higher than random, 0.07%, Supple-
mental Table S5). Then, we asked whether the distance between
neighboring pairs could have an impact on these coexpression
patterns (Supplemental Fig. S12B,C). While 2.95% of lncRNAs have

highly positive correlation with neighboring mRNAs within 20 kb,
this proportion decreases to 0.44% when the neighbor mRNA
is 80–100 kb away (Supplemental Table S6). For mRNAs-mRNAs
cis-correlations, the proportion of proximal <20 kb extreme cor-
relations is less important (1.5%), and thus, the fall of positive ex-
treme correlation seems less distance dependent with 0.3% of highly
correlated pairs being separated by 80–100 kb. To rule out that some
of the correlations arise from lncRNAs being actually unannotated
UTRs of the neighbor protein-coding genes, we focused on the set of
intergenic lncRNAs that appear to be full-length as measured by PET
data (see Section 3). A total of 31 such independent lncRNA units
were highly correlated (rs > 0.7) with neighbor protein-coding genes
at a median distance of 2.6 kb (Supplemental Table S7). Inter-
estingly, using Gene Ontology (GO) analysis based on the DAVID
web server (Huang da et al. 2009), we found that these lncRNAs are
correlated with protein-coding genes enriched in ‘‘regulation of
transcription’’ processes and nucleus compartment. These full-
length lncRNAs, significantly coexpressed with nearby protein-
coding genes, thus represent interesting candidates to be tested
in further experimental studies.
Correlation of expression between overlapping lncRNAs and mRNAs
Almost 40% (3934 lncRNA genes, 5361 transcripts) of GENCODE
lncRNAs intersect protein-coding gene loci, and it is possible that
such lncRNAs somehow contribute to the regulation of the latter
(Fig. 1B; Gingeras 2007; Pasmant et al. 2011). We therefore com-

puted correlations of expression between these lncRNA genes and
their ‘‘host’’ mRNAs and again found that lncRNAs have more
positive correlations with intersecting mRNAs elements than ex-
pected by chance (Supplemental Table S5). Strikingly, compared
with that observed in a control set of mRNAs or the random set,
lncRNAs intersecting protein-coding exons in antisense orienta-
tion (‘‘exonic antisense’’) appear to be specifically enriched in
positive correlations with the mRNA host (Fig. 7C), as observed
previously. Much weaker correlations were observed between
mRNAs and their intronic lncRNAs, regardless of whether the
lncRNA is on the same or opposite strand. In addition, contrary to
our observations above, this finding still holds true when we in-
cluded tissue-specific lncRNAs (Supplemental Fig. S12D). Alto-
gether, we identified 186 lncRNA genes intersecting in antisense
mRNAs exons and exhibiting a strong pattern of coexpression
(Spearman rs > 0.95) with their mRNAs (Supplemental Fig. S13D
illustrates two examples).
LncRNAs are enriched in the nucleus
There is mounting evidence that many lncRNAs are recruited to
chromatin and epigenetically regulate gene expression (Mondal
et al. 2010). Thus, we would expect that lncRNAs should be pref-
erentially localized in the chromatin and nuclear RNA fractions, in
contrast to protein-coding mRNAs that are trafficked to the cyto-
plasm for translation. Analysis of the ENCODE RNA-seq data for
nucleus and cytoplasm from six different cell lines indicates that
this is indeed the case (Djebali et al. 2012). In Figure 8B, we display
the ratio of transcript abundances in the nucleus over the cyto-
plasm. In all cell lines, except for NHEK, we observed a robust and
highly statistically significant enrichment of lncRNAs in the nu-
cleus, compared with protein-coding mRNAs. Furthermore, the
lncRNAs nuclear/cytoplasmic enrichment is consistent between
cell types (Fig. 8C). We also tested whether particular classes of
lncRNA—intergenic, intronic, antisense—had distinct nuclear lo-
calization propensities, but we could find no significant difference,
suggesting that nuclear enrichment is a general property of long
non-protein-coding transcripts (data not shown).
We further investigated whether lncRNAs are enriched in
particular compartments within the nucleus. We asked whether
lncRNAs were enriched in chromatin by calculating the ratio of
chromatin/nuclear RPKM for both lncRNAs and mRNAs (Fig. 8A).
LncRNAs are significantly more enriched in chromatin than mRNAs:
The median chromatin/nucleus expression ratio for lncRNAs is
more than twice that of mRNAs (0.55 vs. 0.26, respectively). This
lends further support to the idea that lncRNAs are specifically re-
cruited to chromatin, where they play a regulatory role.
We examined the subcellular location of a number of well-
known lncRNAs (Fig. 8D). Unsurprisingly, the X-chromosome in-
activating transcript XIST was extremely highly enriched in the
nucleus for all cells we examined (with a maximum enrichment
of 273-fold in the nucleus of GM12878 cells) (Fig. 8D). Other
regulatory lncRNAs such as GAS5 (Kino et al. 2010), LINC00568
(also known as ncRNA-a1), CYP4A22-AS1 (also known as
ncRNA-a3) (Ørom et al. 2010), MIAT (Ishii et al. 2006), and
MEG3 (Zhou et al. 2007) were nuclear enriched in at least two
different cell types, consistent with their reported roles in gene
regulation. Other transcripts, including the bifunctional tran-
script SRA1, which acts as both a regulatory RNA and a protein-
coding sequence, have more variable subcellular location depend-
ing on cell type. As reported previously, the H19 transcript is con-
sistently enriched in the cytoplasm, especially when comparing
with the chromatin fraction (cytoplasmic/chromatin enrichment
167-fold) (Brannan et al. 1990).
We next used a more sophisticated method based on a nega-
tive binomial regression to identify individual lncRNAs and mRNAs
with statistically significant enrichment in either the nuclear or the
cytoplasmic compartments (see Methods). Only the subset of 1339
lncRNAs and 13,933 mRNAs with expression of RPKM > 1 were
analyzed. At a statistical cutoff of P < 0.01 and FDR = 0.1, we found
228 lncRNAs enriched in the nucleus (17% of those tested) and 53
(4%) in the cytoplasm. These proportions are significantly different
(Pearson’s x2 test <2.2 3 1016) than those for protein-coding genes
with 2064 (15%) in the nucleus and 3611 (26%) in the cytoplasm.
As before, the two most nuclear-enriched lncRNAs are XIST and
MEG3, a highly spliced lncRNA involved activation of TP53 (P-value
2.2 3 10214 and 3.9 3 1073, respectively) (Zhou et al. 2007).
Multidimensional scaling (MDS) representation of this data (Sup-
plemental Fig. S14A) reveals the presence of two distinct clusters
corresponding to nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments, with a
predominance for lncRNAs to be localized in the latter (Supple-
mental Fig. S14A, right cluster).
Finally, we examined whether lncRNAs preferentially exist as
polyadenylated or nonpolyadenylated transcripts (Kapranov et al.
2010). Using a similar analysis as above, we calculated the simple
ratio of poly(A)+ to poly(A)- nuclear RNA-seq reads mapping to
lncRNAs, and compared this with protein-coding mRNAs (Sup-
plemental Fig. S14B). In all cell types that we examined in this way,
we found that lncRNAs are significantly enriched in poly(A)-,
compared with mRNAs.
Discussion
Until very recently, RNA’s main cellular role was assumed to be
that of merely a messenger, mediating the transfer of information
from DNA to proteins—the true effectors of biological function.
This view has been altered, however, as a plethora of novel RNA
species has been discovered (see, for instance, Carninci et al. 2005;
Denoeud et al. 2007; Kapranov et al. 2007; Findeiss et al. 2010).
Among these, long noncoding RNAs are emerging as central players
in cell biology. Likely outnumbering protein-coding transcripts,
a small but rapidly growing number of them have been shown to
participate in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. The
precise biological role of the vast majority, however, is still un-
known. Here, we report on the generation and characterization
of the largest catalog of lncRNAs to date. This catalog has been
created through manual curation of available cDNA and EST data by
the GENCODE team within the framework on the ENCODE project.
Using computational and experimental analysis, we have annotated
GENCODE lncRNAs with a wide range of biologically relevant fea-
tures. Since lncRNAs may contribute to explaining the phenotypic
output encoded in the genome not currently explained by protein-
coding genes, this repository and the associated annotation are
likely to become central resources for research in molecular and cell
biology.
Our analyses have shown that most GENCODE lncRNAs are
likely to exist as independent transcriptional units, although it
cannot be ruled out that a fraction of them can also eventually act,
in a regulated fashion, as UTRs of neighbor protein-coding genes.
While it has been recently suggested that lncRNAs have non-
randomly long ORFs (Dinger et al. 2011), we have found that with
a small number of exceptions they exhibit minimal protein-coding
capacity. The genomic structure of lncRNAs is very similar to that
of protein-coding genes, although a surprisingly high proportion

of the former are two-exon transcripts. Overall, we observe that
while lncRNAs have exons of similar length to protein-coding
mRNAs, they have fewer of them—in agreement with the recent
findings of Cabili et al. (2011). One advantage of manual anno-
tation of lncRNAs is that it provides accurate transcription start
site, termination site, and exon–intron boundary information—
although some of the lncRNAs we observed might be processed
from longer precursor transcripts, meaning that the true start and
end sites are beyond our annotations. Nevertheless, our analysis
of promoter-specific histone modifications, and poly(A) signal
frequencies, would suggest that in the majority of cases the tran-
script boundaries we annotate are accurate.
While lncRNAs exons are much less conserved than protein-
coding genes, they are significantly more conserved than an-
cient repeat sequences, used here as a proxy of neutral evolution
(Ponjavic et al. 2007). The evolutionary constraint on their se-
quence, even if weak, is thus an indication of functionality. The
high proportion of primate-specific RNAs suggest that lncRNA
may have a higher turnover rate than proteins. Nonetheless, many
of the transcripts reported here (44%) appear to be evolutionarily
Figure 8.
LncRNAs are enriched in the cell nucleus and chromatin. (A) Shown are the chromatin/cytoplasm expression ratios of lncRNAs and protein-
coding transcripts in K562 cells. Data are represented as log10-transformed ratios of RPKM values (log10[chromatin RPKM/cytoplasm RPKM]). The data

conserved across the majority of placental mammals, and owing to
the difficulty of comparing divergent nucleic acids sequences, one
cannot rule out the possibility that lncRNA may be relatively con-
served as gene units, but too rapidly evolving for conventional se-
quence analysis. Yet, this ancient evolutionary history suggests that
these genes should have properties similar to those of proteins with
families of homologs, or domains shared across otherwise unrelated
sequences. We looked for such families and found them to exist,
although the common domains appear to be mostly degraded ver-
sions of common repeat elements (LINE, SINE, LTR). An analysis
based on multiple sequence conservation suggests the secondary
structures associated with these modules to be actively maintained
through the course of evolution—a finding incompatible with de-
caying repeats. It may therefore be that repeats have been exapted as
functional RNA sequence modules with lncRNAs, as has recently
been observed (Gong and Maquat 2011).
We have found lncRNAs to be particularly enriched in the
nucleus relative to the cytoplasm when compared to protein-
coding genes. Within the nucleus, they are particularly enriched in
the chromatin fraction. While lncRNAs have previously been de-
tected in the chromatin fraction (Mondal et al. 2010), the analysis
of the rich diversity of RNA populations carried out within the
ENCODE project (Djebali et al. 2012) represents the first demon-
stration that lncRNAs as a class are preferentially located in the
chromatin and nucleus of the cell. While this is consistent with the
major role so far proposed for lncRNAs as epigenetic regulators of
gene expression, it could also reflect a higher rate of degradation
(i.e., reduced stability) of lncRNAs compared with protein-coding
genes. Because lncRNAs lack ORFs, and therefore have premature
stop codons, degradation could occur through mechanisms such
as translation-linked nonsense mediated decay (NMD) pathway,
or translation-independent degradation pathways. On the other
hand, the striking preponderance of single intron transcripts could
also be a mechanism to escape NMD-like pathways. In any case,
there is still a population of lncRNAs that are consistently enriched
in the cytoplasm. Therefore, we must stress that although lncRNAs
as a class are enriched in the nucleus compared with mRNAs, many
may nevertheless function in other compartments. This is sup-
ported by various examples of lncRNAs that appear to operate
in the cytoplasm, including MALAT1 (Wilusz et al. 2008), NRON
(Willingham et al. 2005), GAS5 (Kino et al. 2010), or Thy-ncR1 (Aoki
et al. 2010).
The GENCODE annotation is an ongoing process. As addi-
tional sequencing data from a variety of sources becomes available,
GENCODE annotators will refine and reevaluate gene models.
Given the low expression level and tissue specificity of lncRNAs,
increased availability of deep RNA-seq data is particularly rele-
vant to refine and expand the set of lncRNAs. Indeed, while the
number of protein-coding genes has remained relatively stable,
even slightly decreasing, across GENCODE versions (22,500 in
version 3c, November 2009; 20,700 in version 7, April 2011), the
number of lncRNA genes has substantially increased from 6000
to more than 10,000 during this period. It is not unlikely that
lncRNA genes outnumber protein-coding genes in the human
genome. The present annotation, version 7, covers almost 85% of
the human genome; therefore, we expect at least 2000 more lncRNA
genes remain to be discovered with present annotation methods
(Supplemental Fig. S15). Indeed, it is important to note that the
transcripts originating from lncRNA gene loci represent only a frac-
tion of the lncRNA world: ;50% of the transcripts arising from
protein-coding loci (i.e., sense-exonic transcripts) are also non-
coding and have not been analyzed in the present study. While the
function of the vast majority of lncRNAs is unknown, the full im-
portance of their contribution to the cell’s phenotype is presently
impossible to gauge. However, given the demonstrated biological
significance of lncRNA, combined with their large number and the
diversity of their mechanisms of action, it is likely that they con-
stitute a crucial layer of gene regulation that has evolved in complex
organisms.
Methods
LncRNA identification and classification
The GENCODE lncRNAs set version 7 (Harrow et al. 2012) was
downloaded from the official GENCODE ftp repository: ftp://
ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/GENCODE/. The protein-coding set used
to define the lncRNAs category was extracted from the whole
GENCODE 7 annotation (GENCODE.v7.annotation.gtf.gz on the
ftp) and corresponds to transcripts having both gene and transcript
biotypes annotated as ‘‘protein_coding’’ with the ‘‘known’’ status.
This results in a protein-coding set of 20,646 genes, 76,006 tran-
scripts, and 743,827 exons. Then, lncRNA and protein-coding ge-
nomic coordinates were intersected at the exons, introns, and gene
levels using both the Bedtools suite (Quinlan and Hall 2010) and
custom scripts. In an initial filtering step, we removed all
lncRNAs that were shorter than 200 nt or overlapped a protein-
coding exon on the same strand. The resulting set was divided
into categories ‘‘intergenic’’ and ‘‘genic.’’ An lncRNA not inter-
secting any protein-coding loci was defined as intergenic and then
subclassified according to its transcription orientation with the
closest protein-coding gene (same sense, convergent, or divergent).
The genic lncRNA set was classified as exonic if at least one of its
exons intersects a protein-coding exon by at least 1 bp. lncRNAs
intersecting a protein-coding exon on the same strand were dis-
carded from all analyses. Otherwise, lncRNAs were classified as
‘‘intronic,’’ i.e., completely contained within protein-coding introns
(sense or antisense) or overlapping (sense or antisense), i.e., when
the protein-coding transcript was located within the intron of the
lncRNA. For each category, a best mRNA partner is defined accord-
ing to (1) its closer proximity to the lncRNA (intergenic category) or
(2) a higher number of nucleotides intersecting with the candidate
lncRNA (genic category). Finally, for the comparative analysis with
the lncRNAs sets, we defined a stringent set of mRNAs which cor-
responds to transcripts having both gene and transcripts annotated
as ‘‘protein_coding’’ with status ‘‘known,’’ a ‘‘ccdsid’’ tag and no
match with ‘‘{start/stop}_NF’’ (Not Found). This results in a stringent
protein coding set of 17,998 genes, 30,046 transcripts, and 319,048
exons. A full breakdown of subclassifications of lncRNA can be
found in Supplemental Table S1. Furthermore, the number of genes
used in every analysis is detailed in Supplemental Table S9.
Computational data analysis
We have developed and implemented a number of programs and
scripts for bioinformatic and statistical analysis of the lncRNA data,
including (1) assessment of the completeness of the annotated
lncRNA sequences, (2) cross-species conservation of lncRNAs, (3)
chromatin marks, (4) microarray processing, (5) expression corre-
lation, (6) cellular compartmentalization. These methods, in ad-
dition to experimental details, are described in the Supplemental
Methods file.
