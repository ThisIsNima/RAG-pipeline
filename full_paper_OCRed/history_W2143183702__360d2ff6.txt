ABSTRACT 
We present the results of two exploratory parsimony analyses of DNA sequences from 475 and 499 species of 
seed plants, respectively, representing all major taxonomic groups. The data are exclusively from the chloroplast gene 
rbcL, which codes for the large subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO or RuBPCase). 
We used two different state-transformation assumptions resulting in two sets of cladograms: (i) equal-weighting for 
the 499-taxon analysis; and (ii) a procedure that differentially weights transversions over transitions within characters 
and codon positions among characters for the 475-taxon analysis. The degree of congruence between these results 
and other molecular, as well as morphological, cladistic studies indicates that rbcL sequence variation contains historical 
evidence appropriate for phylogenetic analysis at this taxonomic level of sampling. Because the topologies presented 
are necessarily approximate and cannot be evaluated adequately for internal support, these results should be assessed 
from the perspective of their predictive value and used to direct future studies, both molecular and morphological. 
In both analyses, the three genera of Gnetales are placed together as the sister group of the flowering plants, and 
the anomalous aquatic Ceratophyllum (Ceratophyllaceae) is sister to all other flowering plants. Several major lineages 
identified correspond well with at least some recent taxonomic schemes for angiosperms, particularly those of Dahlgren 
and Thorne. The basalmost clades within the angiosperms are orders of the apparently polyphyletic subclass Magnoliidae 
sensu Cronquist. The most conspicuous feature of the topology is that the major division is not monocot versus dicot, 
but rather one correlated with general pollen type: uniaperturate versus triaperturate. The Dilleniidae and Hamamelidae 
are the only subclasses that are grossly polyphyletic; an examination of the latter is presented as an example of the 
use of these broad analyses to focus more restricted studies. A broadly circumscribed Rosidae is paraphyletic to 
Asteridae and Dilleniidae. Subclass Caryophyllidae is monophyletic and derived from within Rosidae in the 475-taxon 
analysis but is sister to a group composed of broadly delineated Asteridae and Rosidae in the 499-taxon study.

Phylogenetics of Seed Plants 
Current assessments of higher-level relationships 
in seed plants are based largely on informed judg- 
ments of the relative value of various reproductive 
and vegetative characters (including secondary 
chemistry) and to some extent on historical pre- 
cedent. Authors of recent taxonomic schemes (for 
example, Dahlgren, 1980; Takhtajan, 1980, 1987; 
Cronquist, 1981; Thorne, 1983, 1992) have syn- 
thesized an enormous amount of information. Nev- 
ertheless, their taxonomic decisions have been guid- 
ed by estimations of which characters are reliable 
indicators of relationships. These differing judg- 
ments are responsible for radical differences in 
delimitation and relative ranks of taxa in each 
system of classification. Recently, a number of 
explicit, cladistic hypotheses have been developed 
at inclusive hierarchical levels (e.g., Crane, 1985, 
1988; Dahlgren & Bremer, 1985; Dahlgren et al., 
1985; Doyle & Donoghue, 1986, 1992; Bremer 
et al., 1987; Donoghue & Doyle, 1989; Loconte 
& Stevenson, 1991; Martin & Dowd, 1991; Ham- 
by & Zimmer, 1992; Hufford, 1992; Olmstead et 
al., 1992; Taylor & Hickey, 1992). Such cladistic 
studies have previously been limited in scope; some 
data matrices contain significant taxonomic gaps, 
and in others characters for some taxa are missing. 
Both of these factors may have unpredictably mis- 
leading effects (Nixon & Davis, 1991; Platnick et 
al., 1991). Despite a great deal of investigation 
and analysis, seed-plant phylogenetics is, at best, 
in a preliminary stage of investigation and knowl- 
edge. 
Molecular data, specifically DNA sequences, 
have received a great deal of attention as a potential 
source of "phylogenetically informative" charac- 
ters that are putatively less ambiguous than non- 
molecular characters. Such pronouncements suffer 
from the limitation that, at higher taxonomic levels, 
no extensive sampling and phylogenetic description 
of DNA sequence variation has taken place. The 
most taxonomically comprehensive analysis of nu- 
cleic acid sequences published so far on plants 
(rRNA; Hamby & Zimmer, 1992) used only 60 
taxa, and a number of these were partial sequences. 
Martin & Dowd (1991), using nucleic acid se- 
quences of the small subunit of RuBisCO (rbcS) 
inferred from amino acid sequences, studied 335 
taxa from 135 families, still less than a third of 
angiosperm families. If insufficient sampling of taxa 
or characters (i.e., sequence length, acknowledged 
as a problem with the rbcS data studied by Martin 
& Dowd, 1991) are indeed factors, then no valid 
investigation of the "informativeness" 
of a given 
gene sequence exists for seed plants. Thus we are 
left with only an unfounded assessment of sequence 
data as having the potential 
to aid in estimating 
higher-level relationships. 
Suggestions that the chloroplast gene rbcL, which 
codes for the large subunit of ribulose- 1 ,5-bis- 
phosphate 
carboxylase/oxygenase 
(RuBisCO 
or 
RuBPCase), 
was an appropriate locus to use in 
phylogenetic 
studies began with Ritland & Clegg 
(1987) 
and Zurawski & Clegg (1987). 
Initial at- 
tempts to evaluate relationships used only a dozen 
or so sequences representing all land plants (Palmer 
et al., 1988; Giannasi et al., 1992). Other recent 
studies have been restricted to single families (Doe- 
bley et al., 1990; Kim et al., 1992) or putatively 
closely related families (Soltis et al., 1990; Les et 
al., 1991; Donoghue et al., 1992; Olmstead et al., 
1992; 
Rettig et al., 1992). 
Most of the latter 
studies began the process of incorporating signifi- 
cantly greater sampling to enhance 
their phylo- 
genetic perspective. 
The use of rbcL was spurred 
by G. Zurawski, who generously made available a 
set of internal sequencing primers. The advent of 
temperature 
cyclers 
and high-temperature-resis- 
tant DNA polymerases 
(sometimes 
termed Poly- 
merase Chain Reaction or PCR) has greatly en- 
hanced rates at which gene sequence 
data are 
accumulating, 
so that effects on phylogenetic 
es- 
timates of more intensive 
sampling of sequence 
variation can now be investigated. 
We wish to examine here the degree to which 
a representative sampling of sequence variation for 
rbcL contains evidence of the evolutionary history 
of seed plants. In this study, we address the quality 
of evidence present in rbcL sequences for all major 
seed-plant lineages (roughly 265 families, the exact 
number depending on the taxonomic scheme fol- 
lowed). To a limited extent, we will compare our 
phylogenetic hypotheses with recent schemes, but 
such comparisons are difficult and must be consid- 
ered heuristic because sister-group relationships ex- 
from the DGAPA, Universidad Nacional Aut6noma de M6xico, Mexico, to LEE. We also thank David L. Swofford 
and John M. Mercer for assistance and advice in running the parsimony analyses; William S. Alverson, Michael T.

pressed in cladograms are difficult to relate directly 
to diagrams and statements of progenitor/descen- 
dant relationships used in many taxonomic schemes. 
Dahlgren et al. (1985) and Dahlgren & Bremer 
(1985) have published analyses most similar to the 
ones presented here but they are not of a similar 
scope. Although some specific topological compo- 
nents can be compared to other cladistic studies 
(Conti et al., 1993; Rodman et al., 1993; Qiu et 
al., 1993; and several of the other studies in this 
issue), morphological phylogenetic studies at this 
level with similar, broad taxonomic sampling do 
not exist. The computational difficulties of evalu- 
ating internal support (e.g., the bootstrap, Felsen- 
stein, 1985; decay analysis, Bremer, 1988) or 
departure from matrix randomness (Archie, 1989; 
Faith & Cranston, 1991; Killersj6 et al., 1992) 
for such large numbers of taxa likewise prevent us 
from addressing extensively these issues here. We 
do present an analysis of families traditionally re- 
ferred to Hamamelidae as an example of how in- 
ternal support for specific clades might be exam- 
ined. (See also other papers in this issue that address 
internal and external support for subsets of the 
general results.) Thus, the broad relationships de- 
scribed here can be used to focus more restricted 
(with fewer taxa), and therefore more rigorous, 
investigations. 
We expect that patterns presented here will 
change somewhat as sequences of more species are 
added or if methodological improvements permit 
exact solutions (for a discussion of progress, see 
Penny et al., 1992). These results nonetheless have 
great value, both from heuristic and methodological 
perspectives, although the preliminary nature of 
these studies precludes a detailed examination of 
implications for seed-plant taxonomy and character 
evolution, as well as investigations of gene and 
protein evolution. 
We have generally followed the taxonomic cir- 
cumscriptions of Cronquist (1981) for dicots be- 
cause this system conforms closely to those used 
in most textbooks and floras. For monocots, we 
have adopted the system of Dahlgren et al. (1985) 
but have changed the superorder ending "-iflorae" 
used by Dahlgren to the more appropriate "-anae" 
(Thorne, 1992). 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Selection of taxa for this study was not guided 
by a specific plan. Close examination of genera 
included in the analysis will reveal an uneven tax- 
onomic distribution; some groups are well repre- 
sented (e.g., Asteraceae and Asteridae in general, 
Cornaceae, Ericales, Magnoliaceae, Zingiberanae), 
whereas others are poorly sampled (e.g., dilleniid 
orders, especially Violales and Theales). Despite 
lack of a coordinated effort, all subclasses and 
orders have at least some representatives. All spe- 
cies that are used in this issue of the Annals of 
the Missouri Botanical Garden are listed alpha- 
betically by family in a final Appendix along with 
other information concerning voucher status, se- 
quence gaps, literature citations for published se- 
quences, and figures of this paper in which each 
taxon occurs. Some taxa that were included in the 
475-taxon data set were excluded from the 499- 
taxon matrix. Thus, in the second analysis certain 
families have fewer representatives, but the overall 
representation of lineages is greater. 
Due to the large number of laboratories that 
contributed unpublished sequences, no standard- 
ized procedure was used to produce the sequences 
analyzed here. A generalization would be the fol- 
lowing: a fragment containing rbcL was amplified 
from a total DNA extract using primers that flank 
or are near the ends of the coding region; this 
fragment was then directly sequenced using one of 
several different procedures or was cloned using 
standard recombinant DNA techniques; dideoxy 
sequencing generally included both strands for at 
least 4/5 of the minimally 1 428-bp gene. Some work- 
ers used more closely spaced primers to sequence 
only one strand of DNA; either strategy appears 
to provide reasonably error-free sequences. Most 
extraction protocols relied on fresh or freshly dried 
leaf samples, but some samples were amplified from 
DNA extracted from herbarium specimens as old 
as 20 years. 
Amplification of rbcL from some taxa produced 
two different products. Some of these products were 
different enough in size to observe on an agarose 
gel, whereas others were detected initially because 
multiple bands occurred at the same points in au- 
toradiograms, indicating that more than one tem- 
plate was present. Nearly all cycads produced two 
loci (Hills & Chase, unpublished), which were sep- 
arately cloned and sequenced to characterize both 
copies. In cycads examined, one copy contained 
deletions that disrupted the reading frame, an in- 
dication that this copy may represent a "pseudo- 
gene." In Convolvulaceae, Olmstead (unpublished) 
detected two copies of rbcL, one copy of which 
contained deletions. In Canella (Canellaceae; Qiu 
et al., 1993) and Galphimia (Malpighiaceae; M. 
W. Chase, H. G. Hills & W. R. Anderson, un- 
published), two size-conserved copies of rbcL were 
also encountered. In Galphimia, one copy clearly 
contained substitutions at numerous sites otherwise 
conserved among angiosperms, suggesting that this

copy was a pseudogene. In Canella, no such un- 
usual substitutions were observed in either copy. 
Two, reading-frame-intact copies of rbcL are also 
reported in Ulmaceae (E. Conti & K. J. Sytsma, 
unpublished). For Canella, we included both se- 
quences in all analyses, but because the two se- 
quences are always each other's sister we show 
only the position of "Canella" (in fact, there are 
two terminals here; the complete matrix used in 
Search II thus has 500 terminals but only 499 
taxa). 
Sequences of rbcL were easily aligned by sight. 
Among land plants, the coding region contains little 
size variation through base position 1428 (num- 
bered from the first nucleotide of methionine in the 
start codon, AUG). Positions 1426, 1427, and 
1428 are the most common stop-codon among land 
plants; longer reading frames, up to 1452 in some 
monocots and 1458 in the Asteraceae (Kim et al., 
1992), appear to be due to insertions, often of a 
short repeating sequence. Most laboratories have 
sequenced past this codon, but for phylogenetic 
analysis we have terminated all sequences at po- 
sition 1428 to be confident that we have analyzed 
homologous regions (the portion of the gene in- 
cluded in this analysis for each species is also 
included in the Appendix). All sequences were en- 
tered into a text file in NEXUS format (used by 
PAUP 3.0; Swofford, 1991) as complete sequences 
and then analyzed directly in nucleotide form. Ma- 
trices used in both searches are available from the 
first author upon receipt of request and a diskette 
for each matrix. 
TREE-SEARCH STRATEGY 
Parsimony-based methods permit direct exam- 
ination of hypothesized character-state changes on 
the reconstructed tree, and this information can 
be used in studies of molecular evolution. (These 
are, however, likely to be underestimates of se- 
quence change and could be misleading for this 
reason.) Numerous empirical studies have shown 
that not all classes of substitutions are equally like- 
ly, and this kind of information may be incorpo- 
rated into weightng schemes for nucleotide data 
(Swofford & Olsen, 1990; Albert & Mishler, 1992; 
among others). Various models of molecular evo- 
lution exist, and appropriately circumspect use of 
these may assist in the separation of historical signal 
from homoplasy. The character-state weighting 
model of Albert et al. (1993, this issue) uses prob- 
ability formulae to calculate weights for different 
classes of molecular change. We have used their 
method in the 475-taxon analysis presented here. 
Although the assumptions of the Albert et al. model 
are admittedly simplistic, we nonetheless support 
the investigation of weighting approaches to nu- 
cleotide data and view the model used here as a 
justifiable first approximation. It must be recog- 
nized that giving all categories of molecular change 
equal transformational weight is also an assump- 
tion, but one that the investigation of Albert et al. 
(1993) found to be adequate if sampling effects 
were not a factor. Actual weights applied in this 
study fall within such a narrow and minimally 
asymmetrical range that deviation of results from 
those using the "equal weighting" criterion of Fitch 
(197 1) is likely to be slight (see Albert et al., 1993). 
Recently, concern has focused on the probability 
that "islands" of equally parsimonious trees exist, 
particularly in large data sets (Maddison, 1991). 
Because of their enormous size, our analyses do 
not use methods of multiple random taxon-addition, 
which have been suggested to uncover such dis- 
junct, equally optimal islands. This topic is ad- 
dressed in most empirical papers in this number. 
The search for parsimonious trees consisted of 
several separate but linked heuristic searches using 
either PAUP 3.Or (Search I; 475 taxa) or 3.Os 
(Search II; 499 taxa). All searches included the 
full data matrix (all codon positions). Search I was 
performed on a SPARC II (Sun, Inc.) workstation 
(PAUP 3.0 for non-Macintosh computers is avail- 
able only by special arrangement with D. Swofford). 
For Search II, a Macintosh Quadra 800 with 20 
MB RAM was used. (Although slower than a Sun 
computer, the more interactive nature of a search 
on a PC is preferred by many workers.) 
In Search I, an initial heuristic search with 
character-state changes given equal weight (i.e., 
"unordered" status), SIMPLE data addition se- 
quence, STEEPEST DESCENT, and NNI (nearest- 
neighbor interchange) branch swapping algorithm 
was used to find a single tree (MULPARS option 
deactivated). The second phase used this single 
tree obtained from phase one as a starting tree for 
another heuristic search, this time using the SPR 
(subtree pruning-regrafting) branch swapping al- 
gorithm with MULPARS deactivated again. The 
third phase paralleled the first and second; the 
single SPR tree from phase two was used as the 
starting topology for a heuristic search using the 
TBR (tree bisection-reconnection) branch swapping 
algorithm, again with MULPARS deactivated. 
The fourth phase used the single TBR tree as 
the starting point for a heuristic search employing 
a character-state weighting criterion (with a dif- 
ferent step matrix for each codon position; cf. 
Swofford, 1991; Albert & Mishler, 1992; Albert 
et al., 1993). This time MULPARS was activated.

Transversion substitutions were weighted over 
transitions differentially by codon position (Albert 
et al., 1993). The specific weights used were the 
following: for transitions, 5520 (first positions), 
6368 (second positions), 4039 (third positions); for 
transversions, 6620 (first positions), 7470 (second 
positions), 5127 (third positions). These weights 
were calculated from empirically derived param- 
eters (see Albert et al., 1993, for a complete de- 
scription and justification). Because use of step 
matrices is CPU-intensive, this search was exe- 
cuted with the simplest branch-swapping algorithm, 
NNI. Additionally, because of dynamic RAM lim- 
itations (a tree of 475 terminals occupies a great 
deal of memory), we restricted our search to a 
maximum of 500 trees. Although the initial TBR 
tree was by default a member of a single island, 
we hoped to provide a bridge to shorter trees through 
use of the STEEPEST DESCENT option (see Mad- 
dison, 1991; Swofford, 1991). This final step yield- 
ed 500 equally parsimonious, weighted trees. Be- 
cause the maximum prespecified number of trees 
was found, many others probably exist at the same 
length. Search I required approximately 200 hours 
to complete. 
Search II was performed for three reasons. 
First, the likely existence of other islands of equal 
or greater parsimony prompted us to use a strategy 
that would be more likely to find shorter trees and 
perhaps a different topology. Second, we were con- 
cerned about the effects of the Albert et al. (1993) 
weighting scheme upon the resulting topology. 
Third, we wished to examine positions of additional 
taxa (and make use of updated sequences) that 
became available after Search I was completed; 
many of these belonged to previously unrepre- 
sented lineages. Differences between these two sets 
of trees could thus be due to different taxon sam- 
pling, corrections or completions of sequences after 
Search I was finished, or search strategy. We did 
not intend these two searches to be controlled, 
direct tests (i.e., with only one variable differing 
between them); we show them both, rather than 
simply the one that we judge to be better (Search 
II), because their similarities, despite variation in 
taxon composition and search strategy, are con- 
siderable. They each represent results of searches 
that in their own context are worthy of publication, 
and their differences should be viewed as reasons 
to be skeptical of both and as cause for future 
study with more rbcL data as well as other char- 
acters. 
In Search II, we were able to save more trees 
at the shortest length found: 3,900 rather than 
only 500 trees. The initial starting tree was pro- 
duced by using the CLOSEST addition sequence 
with the HOLD option set for five trees (this in 
effect permitted initial swapping on several differ- 
ent starting topologies). Approximately 120 hours 
were required merely to add all taxa in this manner. 
The initial search (i) used NNI swapping and 
STEEPEST DESCENT with MULPARS off. The 
shortest single tree found was then swapped on 
using (ii) TBR, which generally found a shorter 
tree, at which time (iii) NNI (with MULPARS) was 
used. When use of MULPARS resulted in 3,900 
trees, which used up available RAM, a single tree 
was randomly selected (iv) to swap on with TBR 
(MULPARS off). If this resulted in a shorter tree 
being found, the search was then stopped and re- 
started (iii, again) using NNI and MULPARS and 
this shorter tree as starting point (iii and iv were 
repeated until no shorter trees were found). The 
shortest tree length found with this method was 
16,305. Three randomly selected trees from the 
3,900 saved at this length were swapped in suc- 
cession to completion with TBR (no MULPARS), 
and no shorter trees were found. A strict consensus 
tree was computed, and branch lengths for one 
randomly selected tree were calculated using the 
ACCTRAN optimization. Search II thus used no 
relative weighting; it required approximately four 
weeks to complete. 
CAVEATS 
Methodologically, these searches suffer from (i) 
uncertainty about maximum parsimony, (ii) un- 
questionable absence of many trees at the same 
level of optimality, (iii) identification of only a single 
topology, and (iv), in Search I, incomplete branch 
swapping on any of the shortest trees found. We 
would never recommend these search strategies for 
smaller data sets, but several options were seriously 
restricted by the number of taxa included (these 
are reputedly the largest PAUP analyses attempted 
to date). Specific sections of the general topologies, 
when analyzed in a more "localized" manner, pro- 
vide different sets of relationships (see Michaels et 
al., 1993; Morgan & Soltis, 1993; both this issue). 
The broader taxon distribution of the general anal- 
ysis (thus with far greater outgroup information) 
may be assessing character-state change on the 
immediate branch leading to a specific ingroup 
differently than in more restricted analyses. Great- 
er outgroup information could "improve" the in- 
group analysis or add spuriousness to it; it is gen- 
erally best to implement tree searches both with 
and without outgroups to examine their effects. If 
more restricted analyses differ from those pre-

Phylogenetics of Seed Plants 
sented here, we would certainly favor the former 
because of increased confidence in finding parsi- 
monious solutions. We nonetheless view these anal- 
yses as instructive about seed-plant relationships 
and the utility and limits of rbcL information (see 
Discussion). 
The major limiting factor in our studies is clearly 
matrix size. When confronted with the largest mo- 
lecular database relevant to seed plants, compu- 
tational trade-offs inevitably arose. The amount of 
time spent on these approximations may not be 
directly proportional to the time taken to generate 
all the rbcL sequences, but no method exists to 
predict how many trees at how many steps shorter 
might have been found after additional months or 
even years of continuous computation. We have 
opted for the approximations presented here rather 
than commit ourselves to an open-ended experi- 
ment. 
Potential effects of errors in autoradiogram read- 
ing and data entry should be considered. We de- 
tected a number of internal stop-codons in se- 
quences used in these analyses, and other workers 
have reported errors of various kinds. Most of these 
were corrected in the matrix used in Search II. 
Certainly the potential for errors is present, but 
the effects of such mistakes should not be extensive 
because they are likely to be random. 
Identification of some taxa in this analysis has 
been questioned due to peculiarity of placement. 
One example of this has been now identified among 
the species used in Search I. We have not expunged 
it from the illustrations; the results represent the 
outcome of real tree searches and are instructive 
for that reason. The sequence analyzed was an 
actual member of the clade into which it was placed, 
but it was not the species to which it had been 
attributed. The material sent by a botanical garden 
and labeled as Kirengeshoma was evidently mis- 
identified. It was almost certainly a member of the 
Parnassia group (Saxifragaceae sensu lato; the 
position it occupies in Fig. 1lA) rather than a 
member of Hydrangeaceae. Sequencing of another 
specimen of Kirengeshoma and subsequent data 
analysis revealed the expected placement of this 
genus with other Hydrangeaceae (Xiang & Soltis, 
unpublished). Other "surprising" results also have 
been checked by obtaining another sample of the 
taxon in question and re-sequencing rbcL. The 
original sequence of purportedly saxifragaceous 
Montinia (which nested in Solanales) was checked 
and found to be accurate. Still others (such as 
Sargentodoxa among Fabaceae) are still being 
reassessed. Most workers have tried to make 
vouchers for each species in this study (see Ap- 
pendix). Many tissue samples were provided by 
botanical gardens, and, if vouchers are not included 
with samples, investigators are dependent upon 
identification of these plants by the respective or- 
ganizations (see Goldblatt et al., 1992; it is critical 
that a voucher sample taken from the same plant 
used for DNA extraction be included at the time 
of collection; accession numbers or vouchers taken 
previously are subject to later events, such as lost 
labels or collector mistakes). Because a number of 
the samples used in these two analyses are un- 
vouchered (see Appendix), reproducibility is com- 
promised. In cases with multiple species from a 
family, we should be able to recognize grossly mis- 
identified samples (but this is true for only 37% of 
the 265 families represented). 
RESULTS 
For display purposes, we show here the com- 
binable component consensus (Bremer, 1990) of 
the 500 equally parsimonious trees found in Search 
I (Figs. 1-15, A series). Because these are char- 
acter-state weighted trees, tree lengths and tree 
statistics (e.g., consistency index, etc.) are not com- 
parable to those of Fitch trees and are not given 
here. For Fitch trees found in Search II, the length 
was 16,305 with a consistency index (C.I., ex- 
cluding unique substitutions and constant charac- 
ters) of 0.102 and a retention index (R.I.) of 0.63 2. 
The branch lengths, again with ACCTRAN opti- 
mization, are shown on one of the 3,900 trees 
selected at random (Figs. 1- 15, series B). Branches 
that collapse in the strict consensus tree are indi- 
cated by arrows on the B series (Figs. 3-15B). 
First we will summarize the topology found in 
Search I ("A" series of figures). The results of 
Search II ("B" series) have been interdigitated with 
those of Search I to facilitate comparisons. After 
describing the results of Search I, we briefly ex- 
amine major differences between the two results. 
Note that all figures in the A series are from the 
combinable component consensus tree, whereas in 
the B series, Figures 1 B and 2B are the strict 
consensus tree (branch lengths in Fig. 2B, however, 
were taken from a single tree) and the remainder 
(Figs. 3B- 1 5B) are a single tree randomly selected 
from 3,900 equally parsimonious Fitch trees (this 
may be confusing; for example, whereas the po- 
lytomy among monosulcate clades in Figs. 1 B and 
2B is due to variation among the 3,900 trees for 
branches in this portion, the topology shown in 3B 
is resolved because it is resolved in the single tree 
selected). To indicate branches of the B series that 
are absent in the strict consensus tree of the 3,900,

we have placed arrows to their right. The branch 
lengths presented in the B series should under no 
circumstances be interpreted as meaningful mea- 
sures of support; thus, in the example of Hama- 
melidae provided, branches that decay at one step 
less parsimonious have lengths that range from 2 
to 16 steps, whereas those that decay at four steps 
less parsimonious range from 7 to 14 steps (Fig. 
16). The sole reason for providing branch lengths 
in the B series is to permit readers to estimate 
roughly relative degrees of divergence and to iden- 
tify cases in which long terminal branches are 
connected to short internal branches (a situation 
in which adding related taxa often radically alters 
hypothesized relationships). 
Search I. 
Unless stated otherwise, we have 
used the taxonomic circumscriptions of Cronquist 
(1981) for dicots and Dahlgren et al. (1985) for 
monocots, although we acknowledge that other re- 
cent systems fit these results better. We arranged 
the unrooted trees of both searches with cycads 
sister to all other seed plants (Figs. 1-3) in accord 
with recent results of several non-molecular cla- 
distic studies (Crane, 1985, 1988; Doyle & Don- 
oghue, 1986, 1992). In Search I, conifers are 
paraphyletic, but some trees (not shown) found in 
Search II have a monophyletic conifer lineage; the 
strict consensus tree from Search II is unresolved 
regarding conifers (Figs. 1B, 2B; we have cited in 
this section the B series of figures along with the 
A series if they include the same general set of 
taxa). The three genera of Gnetales, Ephedra, 
Welwitschia, and Gnetum, are highly divergent 
from all other seed plants but were nonetheless 
identified as sister of the angiosperms (Fig. 3A, B), 
within which Ceratophyllum (Ceratophyllaceae) 
alone is sister to and highly divergent from the rest 
(Fig. 4A, B). The major feature of flowering plants 
(exclusive of Ceratophyllum) is their separation 
into two major groups; these correspond well with 
distributions of the two major angiospermous pollen 
types, uniaperturate (monosulcate and monosul- 
cate-derived) and triaperturate (tricolpate and tri- 
colpate-derived). Ceratophyllum has inaperturate 
pollen (Cronquist, 1981). The major exception to 
this split is the presence of tricolpate pollen in 
Illiciaceae and Schisandraceae, which fall among 
the monosulcate taxa (Fig. 4A, B; see Qiu et al., 
1993, this issue). No morphological support for 
monophyly of the monosulcate clade has been rec- 
ognized in the literature (their pollen type exists 
among nonflowering seed plants and thus must be 
considered plesiomorphic). 
Three monophyletic lineages within uniapertur- 
ate magnoliids were identified, and these corre- 
spond closely, although not exactly, to (i) Mag- 
noliales, (ii) Laurales, and (iii) "paleoherbs" (here 
defined as composed of Aristolochiales, Piperales, 
and Nymphaeales; Fig. 4A). Monocots (also with 
uniaperturate pollen and sometimes included in 
"paleoherbs"; Donoghue & Doyle, 1989) repre- 
sent a fourth member of this lade. Among the 
paleoherbs are also nested several problematic fam- 
ilies: Illiciaceae, Schisandraceae (both Illiciales), 
Amborellaceae (Laurales), and Austrobaileyaceae 
(Magnoliales). Chloranthaceae are also allied cla- 
distically with the paleoherbs, but Chloranthus does 
not form a monophyletic group with other Piper- 
ales. 
Monocots are a well supported monophyletic 
group (see Duvall et al., 1993, and Qiu et al., 
1993, both this issue) and are derived from within 
monosulcate Magnoliidae; the paleoherbs are their 
immediate sister group (Fig. 4A). Within monocots 
(Fig. 5A, B), Aranae plus Pleea (of polyphyletic 
Melanthiaceae; Lilianae) are basal-most, followed 
by Alismatanae plus Burmannia (Burmanniaceae) 
and Aletris (Melanthiaceae). Lilianae form a para- 
phyletic series of three lineages that correspond 
well to Dioscoreales, Liliales, and Asparagales of 
Dahlgren et al. (1985), except in the placement 
of certain families (Iridaceae, Orchidaceae, and 
Smilacaceae) and genera (Chamaelirium of Melan- 
thiaceae: Melanthiales). Vellozia (Velloziaceae: 
Bromelianae), Freycinetia (Pandanaceae: Panda- 
nanae), and Sphaeradenia (Cyclanthaceae: Cy- 
clanthanae) together form a monophyletic lade 
that is collectively sister of the Liliales. The "com- 
melinoid" group of monocots (Fig. 6A, B) incor- 
porates all of those that Harris & Hartley (1980) 
found to exhibit fluorescing cell-wall phenolics. In 
both searches, this commelinoid lade includes 
monophyletic Arecanae and Zingiberanae and 
polyphyletic Bromelianae and Commelinanae (Fig. 
6A, B). Cyclanthaceae have the same phenolic 
biosynthetic pathway but do not accumulate end 
products; they are not members of the commelinoid 
assemblage (Clark et al., in prep.). 
The two orders of Magnoliidae with triaperturate 
pollen, Ranunculales and Papaverales, form a lade 
that is sister to the rest of "eudicots" (Fig. 7A, 
B). The term "eudicot" has been variously defined 
in the literature, but we use it here to refer to all 
angiosperms with triaperturate or triaperturate-de- 
rived pollen (Donoghue & Doyle, 1989; Doyle & 
Holton, 1991). This is one of the best supported 
clades among angiosperms (Qiu et al., 1993, this 
issue). Two other basal clades within the eudicots 
(Fig. 7A, B) consist of some Hamamelidae (Troch- 
odendraceae and Tetracentraceae) and Platana- 
ceae, Sabiaceae, Nelumbonaceae, and Proteaceae. 
Within eudicots, two large sister clades are iden-

Phylogenetics of Seed Plants 
tified, one that corresponds roughly to Asteridae 
and the other to Rosidae (Figs. 1, 2). Membership 
in both lineages is considerably expanded with re- 
spect to their circumscription by Cronquist (1981), 
although less so with respect to the circumscriptions 
of Dahlgren & Bremer (1985) and Thorne (1992). 
These two major clades (Fig. 2A, B) reflect the 
division of eudicots into two major groups (Young 
& Watson, 1970): sympetalous/tenuinucellate and 
polypetalous/not tenuinucellate (asterids and ros- 
ids, respectively, in our figures). The "crassinu- 
cellate" condition actually consists of several dif- 
ferent states. Exceptions to this generalization exist, 
but these traits appear much less homoplastic here 
than in most systems of classification. The basal- 
most lineage within Rosidae includes Saxifragaceae 
sensu stricto and Crassulaceae besides lower ha- 
mamelids such as Cercidiphyllum and Hamamelis 
(Fig. 8A; see Morgan & Soltis, 1993, this issue, 
for a discussion of Saxifragaceae sensu lato). The 
next-most-basal group contains Caryophyllidae (in- 
cluding Plumbaginaceae and Polygonaceae; Rettig 
et al., 1992) plus Droseraceae, Nepenthaceae (Ne- 
penthales, Dilleniidae; see Albert et al., 1992b), 
Dilleniaceae (Dilleniidae), and Vitaceae (Fig. 9A). 
The remaining Rosidae are split into two large 
sister groups (Figs. 2A, I0A, lIA). In one (rosid 
I) are several families of higher Hamamelidae, Eu- 
phorbiales, Fabales, Linales, Polygalales, and Ro- 
sales (Fig. 1 lA). Other members of this lade in- 
clude a number of dilleniid families: Ochnaceae 
(Theales), Datiscaceae, Passifloraceae, and Viola- 
ceae (all Violales). Ordinal boundaries of this group 
of Rosidae (sensu Cronquist, 1981) are largely 
unsupported; this assemblage is particularly het- 
erogeneous. The largest polytomy in the consensus 
tree from Search I occurs at the base of this group, 
and sampling of the families that potentially belong 
to this lade is the most sparse in this analysis. 
The other major lineage of Rosidae (rosid II; Fig. 
1 A) includes orders Myrtales (see Conti et al., 
1993, this issue) and Sapindales, for which ordinal 
boundaries are reasonably intact. Malvaceae (Mal- 
vales; Dilleniidae) and all but one of the mustard- 
oil families (those in Capparales plus others in Dil- 
leniidae; see Rodman et al., 1993, this issue) are 
associated with Sapindales. Geraniaceae are also 
members of this lade, although other members of 
Geraniales appear elsewhere (Oxalidaceae with a 
group of families in Rosales, Fig. llA; Balsami- 
naceae with Ebenales, Fig. 13A, B; and mustard- 
oil-producing Limnanthaceae and Tropaeolaceae 
with Capparales, Fig. I1A, B; Price & Palmer, 
1993, this issue). Two members of Rosales, Greyia 
(Greyiaceae) and Francoa (Saxifragaceae), appear 
derived from within Geraniaceae, if Viviania is 
included in Geraniaceae (see also Price & Palmer, 
1993, and Morgan & Soltis, 1993, this issue). 
The tenuinucellate/sympetalous lade that ter- 
minates in Asteridae sensu Cronquist (1981) was 
also identified by Olmstead et al. (1992) in their 
efforts to circumscribe subclass Asteridae using 
rbcL sequences. This study greatly expands upon 
their sampling and identifies as members of the 
asterid lade two lineages of often polypetalous 
Rosidae (Figs. 2A, 12A): (i) Santalales plus Paeoni- 
aceae and Gunneraceae and (ii) some families of 
Cornales plus Hydrangeaceae (see Xiang et al., 
1993, this issue). The sister group of Asteridae is 
a lade (Figs. 2A, B, 13A, B; see Kron & Chase, 
1993, this issue) that contains the dilleniid orders 
Ebenales, Ericales, Primulales, Diapensiales, plus 
some members of Theales (Actinidiaceae and Thea- 
ceae). Sarraceniaceae (Nepenthales; Dilleniidae) and 
Roridula (but not Byblis of Byblidaceae of Ro- 
sales: Rosidae) are also members of this lineage 
(Albert et al., 1992b). Polemoniaceae (Solanales: 
Asteridae) and Balsaminaceae (Geraniales: Rosi- 
dae) also belong to this ericalean/ebenalean group. 
(See also Olmstead et al., 1993, this issue, for a 
treatment of the Asteridae sensu lato.) 
Asteridae sensu Cronquist split into two major 
sister groups. In one of these (asterid II; Fig. 14A, 
B) are families of Asterales, Calycerales, Campan- 
ulales, Dipsacales, and some Solanales (Menyan- 
thaceae). Rosid taxa that are members of this lade 
include Apiales, Aquifoliaceae (Celastrales), some 
Cornaceae (Cornales), Pittosporaceae and Gros- 
sulariaceae (both Rosales). In the other major lade 
(Fig. 1 5A, B) fall orders Callitrichales, Gentianales, 
Lamiales, Rubiales, Scrophulariales, and most So- 
lanales, although these ordinal limits are not always 
supported (see Olmstead et al., 1993, this issue). 
In this lade (Fig. 15A, B) is a group that includes 
rosids Aucuba (Cornaceae: Cornales) and Garrya 
(Garryaceae: Cornales) and hamamelid Eucommia 
(Eucommiaceae: Eucommiales), all of which ac- 
cumulate aucubin (Cronquist, 1981) and share dis- 
tinctive anatomical wood characteristics (E. Whee- 
ler, pers. comm.). Thus the suite of floral 
characteristics that have been interpreted as sup- 
port for the monophyly of Asteridae sensu Cron- 
quist (1981) appears either (i) to have twice arisen 
independently from ancestors with rosalean and 
cornalean floral traits or (ii) to have undergone 
reversals in groups traditionally included in Rosidae 
(sensu Cronquist; Donoghue et al., 1992; Olmstead 
et al., 1992, 1993, this issue). 
Search II. 
A number of taxa from Search I 
were removed from Search II (all marked with a 
"t" in the A series of figures) to accommodate the 
representatives of additional lineages in Search II.

----- Page 9 (native) -----

Annals of the 
Missouri Botanical Garden 
Most of the removed taxa were from monophyletic 
families in which six or more species were present 
in Search I (for example, Asteraceae, Ericaceae sen- 
su lato, Magnoliaceae, and Poaceae). Two others, 
Burmannia (Burmanniaceae) and Hydrolea (Hy- 
drophyllaceae), were removed because they are 
highly sequence divergent from all other taxa; in 
separate, smaller analyses, these two appear to be 
involved in "branch attractions" and attach in rad- 
ically different positions as other taxa are added 
or removed (other similarly divergent genera, for 
example, Paeonia and Gunnera, do not cause these 
problems and were kept; we admit to being rela- 
tively arbitrary in removing only these two taxa). 
Burmannia presents an interesting case. Members 
of Burmanniaceae are often achlorophyllous; in 
spite of being green, Burmannia may still derive 
a great deal of its nutrition through its mycorrhizal 
associate. In such cases in other families, a number 
of protein loci exhibit higher rates of sequence 
divergence (as measured by relative branch lengths 
when compared to completely autotrophic mem- 
bers of their lineages; C. dePamphilis, pers. comm.). 
Thus the high levels of sequence divergence, which 
make it difficult to place these taxa accurately, are 
a product of or at least associated with their partial 
heterotrophy. 
For Search II, additional taxa were available 
(these species are marked with asterisks in the B 
series of figures). The placements of these are 
described first, and then different arrangements of 
taxa included in both searches are identified (the 
clades involved with major shifts of position are 
marked with an "?" in Fig. 2B). This last section 
describes only the major shifts of position, but many 
"minor" shifts also occur within clades (for ex- 
ample, 12 "minor" shifts take place among the 
taxa in Fig. 15, a lade in which only a few new 
species were added). What constitutes a "major" 
versus a "minor" alteration is, of course, a matter 
of personal perspective. We would therefore advise 
readers to examine carefully the trees from both 
searches for taxa of specific interest, which is one 
reason we presented and intercalated the results 
of both analyses. 
Positions of additional taxa. 
Ginkgo (Gink- 
goaceae) intercalates between cycads and conifers 
(Figs. 1-3B). Taxus (Taxaceae), Cephalotaxus 
(Cephalotaxaceae), and Sciadopitys (Taxodiaceae 
or in its own family) are members of the non- 
Pinaceae lade of conifers, with Sciadopitys sister 
to the rest of that lade (Fig. 3B). Within magnoliid 
angiosperms, Lactoris (Lactoridaceae) is sister to 
Aristolochia (Aristolochiaceae). Other new mag- 
noliid species added in Search II represent addi- 
tional members of families already present in Search 
I, and all of these form monophyletic units with 
other members of their respective families (Fig. 
4B). 
Sister to all other monocots is Acorus (Araceae; 
see Duvall et al., 1993, this issue). Calochortus 
(Calochortaceae) is sister to Liliaceae, Hemero- 
callis (Hemerocallidaceae) is sister to Chlorophy- 
tum (Anthericaceae), and Lomandra (Dasypogona- 
ceae) is a member of the often arborescent lade 
composed of Agavaceae, Asphodelaceae, and Xan- 
thorrhoeacae within Lilianae (Fig. 5B). Additional 
members of families in Search I are all placed as 
sister taxa to their respective family representa- 
tives. Among the commelinoid lade identified in 
Search I (Fig. 6A, B) are the following additional 
families: Sparganium (Sparganiaceae) sister to Ty- 
pha (Typhaceae) and Lachnocaulon (Eriocaula- 
ceae) among the graminoids. 
Among eudicots (Fig. 7A, B), Pachysandra 
(Buxaceae) is sister to Trochodendrales (Trocho- 
dendron and Tetracentron). Composition of the 
various rosid clades is somewhat different in Search 
II (Fig. 2B; see below), but the following additional 
taxa are placed roughly among the rosid II (Fig. 
1OB) lade identified in Search I: Shorea (Dipter- 
ocarpaceae), Theobroma (Sterculiaceae), Tilia (Til- 
iaceae), and Bombax (Bombacaeae) are members 
of a malvalean lade (represented only by Gos- 
sypium in Search I). Akania (Akaniaceae) and 
Bretschneidera (Bretschneideraceae), both Sap- 
indales, are members of the mustard-oil lade. Three 
additional members of Capparaceae, Cleome, Koe- 
berlinia, and Setchellanthus, along with Cappa- 
ris, create a polyphyletic Capparaceae (Fig. 1 OB; 
see also Rodman et al., 1993, this issue). Hyp- 
seocharis (Oxalidaceae) is sister to a lade con- 
taining many Geraniaceae (Fig. 1 OB; see Price & 
Palmer, 1993, this issue). Among members of rosid 
I (Fig. 1I B, C) are representatives of the following 
new families: Reinwardtia (Linaceae) is sister to 
Viola (Violaceae); Sargentodoxa (Sargentodoxa- 
ceae) is imbedded in Fabaceae; Humulus (Can- 
nabinaceae), Trema (Ulmaceae), and Boehmeria 
(Urticaceae) fall into an urticalean lade with Mo- 
rus and Ficus (both Moraceae), but Ulmaceae are 
paraphyletic to Cannabaceae; Coriaria (Coriaria- 
caeae), Begonia (Begoniaceae), and three genera 
of Cucurbitaceae are placed with Datiscaceae; Bet- 
ula (Betulaceae) and Carya (Juglandaceae) are 
members of the lade containing Fagaceae and 
Casuarinaceae; Mouriri and Osbeckia (Melasto- 
mataceae), Punica (Punicaceae), Trapa (Trapa-

ceae), and Heteropyxis (Myrtaceae) are members 
of a lade of (mostly Myrtales) that includes On- 
agraceae and Combretaceae (Fig. 1 IC). In asterid 
lineages, two additional families have been added: 
Byblis (Byblidaceae) and Vahlia (Saxifragaceae) 
are placed among Schrophulariales (Fig. 15B). 
Changes in placements of major clades. 
At 
higher levels among the seed plants, Search II 
produced relatively few "major" differences in tax- 
on placements from the topology of Search I. The 
conifers in some, but not all, 3,900 trees are mono- 
phyletic. Piperales-Aristolochiales were sister to 
all monosulcate angiosperms (Figs. 2B, 4B). The 
"paleoherb" lade of Search I (Fig. 4A) was thus 
split in two with the portion containing Chloran- 
thaceae, Illiciales, Austrobaileyaceae, Amborella- 
ceae, and Nymphaeales situated as sister to Mag- 
noliales. Although these may seem to represent 
major shifts, extremely short branches separate 
these clades (Fig. 4B); thus neither topology has 
much internal support (Qiu et al., 1993, this issue). 
Within monocots, only shifts among the groups in 
Aranae, Alismatanae, and Liianae occurred (Fig. 
5B): Aranae (minus Acorus) are sister to Alisma- 
tanae; the lade containing Pandanaceae, Cyclan- 
thaceae, and Velloziaceae is isolated and no longer 
sister to Liiales, and Dioscoreales are sister to the 
commelinoid taxa (the position of Asparagales in 
the trees from Search I). Among commelinoid taxa 
(Fig. 6B), Stegolepis (Rapateaceae) is sister to 
Bromeliaceae, Typhales are sister to Juncaceae- 
Cyperaceae, and Flagellaria is sister to the other 
graminoid lade. 
Among eudicots, three major shifts of taxa pres- 
ent in Search I occurred. The first series of re- 
arrangements involves the heterogeneous asterid 
V lade (Fig. 12A). Gunnera (Gunneraceae) in- 
tercalates as an isolated lineage (Fig. 7B) between 
Trochodendrales (plus Pachysandra of Buxaceae) 
and higher eudicots (asterids, caryophyllids, and 
rosids). Santalales, Phoradendron (Viscaceae), 
Schoepfia (Olacaceae), and Osyris (Santalaceae) 
become sister to Caryophyllidae-Droseraceae- 
Nepenthaceae (Fig. 9B), and this larger caryophyl- 
lid lade is shifted from a position within the rosid 
lade (rosid III; Figs. 2A, 9A) to sister to the larger 
asterid-rosid lade (Figs. 2B, 9B). The remaining 
member of asterid V, Paeonia (Paeoniaceae), is 
deeply imbedded within rosid III lade (Fig. 8B) 
as sister to Crassulaceae. We attach little signifi- 
cance to these shifts of position; internal branches 
of these groups are among the shortest supporting 
positions of major clades. 
The second series of shifts occurs within rosids. 
Families of Myrtales (plus Qualea of Vochysiaceae, 
Polygalales) and the lade containing Viviania, 
Wendtia (both Geraniaceae), Greyia (Greyiaceae), 
and Francoa (Saxifragaceae) are shifted from rosid 
II to rosid I (Fig. 1 iB, C), and relationships of 
intermediate-level clades (containing several fam- 
ilies, i.e., those of Urticales, Fagales, etc.) are 
somewhat modified from their position in Search I. 
The third shift involves the two taxa that were 
sister to the expanded caryophyllid lade from 
Search I (Fig. 9A): Dillenia (Dilleniaceae) and Vitis 
(Vitaceae), which become sister to the rest of the 
larger asterid lade (Fig. 12B; Vitis and Dillenia 
in a sense exchanged positions with Santalales). 
Again, these groups have short internal branches, 
and these shifts would require little change of over- 
all parsimony. 
In several instances, the topology of Search II 
(which we favor because it was a more complete 
search) is more similar to that found in investi- 
gations of restricted nature (for example, outgroup 
relationships of Asteraceae are identical with those 
found by Michaels et al., 1993, this issue, and 
Olmstead et al., 1992, whereas those of Search I 
deviated in several ways). 
DISCUSSION 
Although rbcL sequences for several groups of 
spore-bearing plants are available (true mosses, 
hornworts, liverworts, Equisetum, Isoetes, Lyco- 
podium, Psilotum, and both eu- and leptosporangi- 
ate ferns), their use as outgroups is complicated 
by extensive sequence divergence relative to that 
in the seed-plant ingroup. No other extant lineages 
of land plants are likely to have shared a common 
ancestor with seed plants for well over 350 million 
years, and a great deal of sequence change, much 
of it in the form of multiple, unrecoverable sub- 
stitutions, has occurred. Analysis of these other 
land plant sequences produces topologies (not shown, 
but see Hamby & Zimmer, 1992, for similar re- 
sults) that are radically different from all previous 
hypotheses of relationships (e.g., Bremer et al., 
1987). In contrast, seed-plant relationships pre- 
sented here are at least congruent in gross aspect 
with comparable morphological studies (Crane, 
1985, 1988; Doyle & Donoghue, 1986, 1992; 
Loconte & Stevenson, 1991). Addition of highly 
sequence-divergent outgroups could be expected 
to increase ingroup homoplasy with unpredictable 
topological results (Felsenstein, 1978). In these 
analyses, we have chosen to use the more conser- 
vative approach of an unrooted ingroup analysis

of seed plants, which are almost certainly mono- 
phyletic (Doyle & Donoghue, 1986, 1992). 
Likewise, effects of missing groups upon topol- 
ogies may be profound (Donoghue et al., 1989) 
and unpredictable, and we expect the absence of 
the numerous extinct lineages of early land plants 
in molecular data matrices to pose potentially se- 
rious problems for elucidating relationships of ex- 
tant lineages. Perhaps more conservative genes 
sampled for more of the sequence variation present 
within extant groups may be able to "bridge" gaps 
caused by extinction. Features of genome organi- 
zation (such as gene and intron content and gene 
order; Downie & Palmer, 1992; Raubeson & Jan- 
sen, 1992) may offer more robust hypotheses than 
gene sequences for such questions, but these are 
likely to be too few to provide a fully resolved tree 
by themselves. A great deal more experimentation 
with combined data sets of morphological and mo- 
lecular characters is obviously needed, and a num- 
ber of these studies are underway (both with rbcL 
and rRNA/rDNA data). Consideration of these 
problems here is premature. 
Sister-group status of angiosperms and Gnetales 
(Figs. 2A, B and 3A, B) is corroborated by other 
cladistic studies (Crane, 1985, 1988; Doyle & 
Donoghue, 1986, 1992; Loconte & Stevenson, 
1991). The isolated position of Ceratophyllum as 
sister to all other angiosperms has been argued 
previously (Les, 1988; Les et al., 1991). In studies 
by Qiu et al. (1993, this issue) in which non- 
flowering seed plants were removed, this arrange- 
ment was made equivocal by the existence of an- 
other equally parsimonious island in which Cera- 
tophyllum occurred in a radically different position. 
Hamby & Zimmer (1992; rRNA) also found a yet 
different placement for Ceratophyllum (but we 
suspect that the sparser sampling of their study 
may be responsible for most of the differences from 
those found with rbcL). In instances in which a 
taxon's morphology and anatomy are as divergent 
and potentially modified as those of Ceratophyl- 
lum, its position becomes difficult to address ade- 
quately in cladistic studies. Ceratophyllum has been 
absent from many morphological cladistic studies, 
such as those of Doyle & Donoghue (1986, 1992), 
so corroboration is currently precluded. 
The general groupings of angiosperms (exclusive 
of Ceratophyllum) identified in these two analyses 
are highly similar to each other and to those of 
most recent taxonomic schemes, particularly those 
of Dahlgren (1980), Dahlgren et al. (1985), and 
Thorne (1992; this last has admittedly incorporated 
results of several molecular investigations). Fur- 
thermore, results of rbcS (Martin & Dowd, 1991) 
and ribosomal studies (Hamby & Zimmer, 1992) 
are quite similar to ours as well. How these larger 
groupings (clusters of families and in some cases 
orders) are inter-related is the point at which their 
similarity diverges. Although having quite different 
implications for angiosperm origins and evolution, 
the preferred hypothesis in one of these studies is 
not vastly different in relative parsimony from those 
favored in other investigations. 
For example, with 
mostly morphological 
data, Doyle & Donoghue 
(1986) 
discovered a "paleoherb rooting" at one 
step less parsimonious. 
Constraining a paleoherb 
rooting for angiosperms, 
at Nymphaeales 
(as in 
Hamby & Zimmer, 1992), was also only slightly 
less parsimonious in the subset of angiosperm rbcL 
sequences studied by Qiu et al. (1993, 
this issue). 
When examined to address basal angiosperm re- 
lationships, all these data appear to lack a strong 
historical signal. 
A number of phenomena have been suggested 
to be capable of confounding molecular phyloge- 
netic studies. We consider below several of these 
factors and examine their potential to affect studies 
of rbcL sequence variation and then address some 
additional concerns about future directions of mo- 
lecular systematic study. 
EFFECTS OF PARALLEL NUCLEOTIDE 
SUBSTITUTIONS IN INDEPENDENT LINEAGES 
An effect of unrecoverable 
(due to extinction) 
or unobserved (due to insufficient sampling) char- 
acter-state changes is the introduction of spurious 
similarities, which may result in treatment of in- 
dependently 
derived nucleotides 
at a given base 
position as homologous 
(see Albert & Mishler, 
1992). Such mistaken interpretations of indepen- 
dent events can lead to "branch attractions" if an 
analysis includes a great number of such assess- 
ments (Felsenstein, 
1978). 
Adequate taxon sam- 
pling, sometimes referred to as appropriate "taxon 
density," is one means of reducing potentially in- 
accurate assessments of similarity, but determining 
at what point sampling is sufficient has so far only 
been addressed in an a posteriori manner. 
The improvement 
afforded to assessments 
of 
character-state 
change by increased taxon sam- 
pling is counterbalanced 
by a decrease 
in com- 
putational speed and ability to ascertain how near 
results are to maximum parsimony. Intrafamilial 
studies are not as likely to be affected severely by 
these problems because, 
in general, numbers of 
taxa are not as great and evenness of sampling is 
better. At higher taxonomic levels within seed plants, 
a paradoxical 
impediment 
to progress arises: if 
taxon number is great enough to assess character-

1993 
Phylogenetics of Seed Plants 
state changes accurately, then one reasonably can 
expect to reach only suboptimal phylogenetic so- 
lutions, but if taxon number is restricted enough 
to gain confidence of the maximum parsimony of 
the trees found, spurious assessments of character- 
state identity could obscure all but the closest re- 
lationships. 
To evaluate relationships of Plumbaginaceae and 
Polygonaceae to families of Caryophyllales, Gian- 
nasi et al. (1992) used a number of phenetic and 
"phylogenetic" methods, including a Fitch-Mar- 
goliash dendrogram based upon genetic distances 
(Kimura, 1981; Felsenstein, 1990), maximum par- 
simony (PHYLIP, Felsenstein, 1990; PAUP, Swof- 
ford, 1991), and maximum likelihood (ML; Fel- 
senstein, 1981). All three methods produced the 
same lack of resolution concerning relationships of 
these families; to state that Plumbaginaceae and 
Polygonaceae are "not closely related" (meaning 
"closely similar") to Caryophyllales does not pre- 
clude them nonetheless from being closest relatives. 
From the perspective of results presented here (Fig. 
9A, B), spurious similarities in the data analyzed 
by Giannasi et al. (1992) appear to affect equally 
results of all three tree-building methods: Gossyp- 
ium simultaneously attracts higher asterids and 
magnoliids (in our trees Gossypium is well imbed- 
ded among rosids; rosid II, Fig. 1iA, B). (See 
Olmstead et al., 1992, 1993, this issue, for an 
example and discussion of the effects of taxon 
sampling.) 
Prospects for improvements of tree-building 
methods with greater numbers of taxa exist (Penny 
et al., 1992). In the example of Giannasi et al. 
(1992), none of the methods employed succeeded 
in eliminating what we interpret as branch attrac- 
tions due to the small number of taxa sampled and 
use of distantly related outgroups. Phylogenetic 
studies using morphological characters for a closely 
related group of rosid or asterid families would 
likely be affected adversely by outgroups of mag- 
noliids or monocots. This phenomenon is perhaps 
even more probable with nucleotide data in which 
homology is initially assessed only by nucleotide 
position and character states are restricted to the 
same four alternatives. Character "homology" for 
distantly related taxa can be easily determined with 
rbcL data (i.e., a given nucleotide position in this 
size-conserved gene; "primary homology," de 
Pinna, 1991), but this does not mean that assess- 
ments of character-state homology (synapomor- 
phy) are less subject to homoplasy than with other 
data. 
If phylogenetic analyses of nucleotide data can- 
not be expected to reveal relationships when sam- 
pled with manageable numbers of taxa (from the 
standpoint of computation of minimal trees) and if 
sampling with sufficient numbers of taxa precludes 
assessing the parsimony of results, then we have 
reached an impasse until improved methods of anal- 
ysis are developed. An appreciation of this problem 
has led us to be skeptical of the overall topologies 
presented (Figs. 1, 2), and competing ideas of re- 
lationships should not be overlooked when per- 
forming more restricted analyses of these and other 
gene sequences. 
INTERNAL SUPPORT FOR THE BROAD TOPOLOGY: 
AN AD HOC ANALYSIS OF SUBCLASS HAMAMELIDAE 
For purposes of suggesting an appropriate man- 
ner to examine internal support of families tradi- 
tionally recognized as a natural group, we selected 
one of the most controversial subclasses, Hama- 
melidae sensu Cronquist (1981), for which we have 
data from 18 of 24 families. Numerous phyloge- 
netic and systematic studies of the Hamamelidae 
have been completed (see various authors in Crane 
& Blackmore, 1989). The morphological features 
suggesting a close relationship among these families 
are largely those associated with the temperate 
amentiferous syndrome, and these clearly could be 
the result of parallel modification in unrelated lin- 
eages. In their developmental characteristics and 
wood anatomy, families of Hamamelidae are par- 
ticularly heterogeneous (Cronquist, 1981; Crane 
& Blackmore, 1989). In performing the broad 
analysis, we sought to avoid a priori ideas about 
what constituted monophyletic subgroupings of an- 
giosperms, but for this heuristic example we have 
accepted ad hoc the outgroup relationships found 
in the general study. 
We selected 72 species that included all mem- 
bers of Hamamelidae and their immediate sister 
taxa as identified in trees from both searches. No 
attempt was made to select species that would 
reproduce the particulars of the general topologies. 
A tree search under the Fitch (equal weights) cri- 
terion using 2,000 random sequence additions, 
MULPARS, STEEPEST DESCENT, and NNI 
branch-swapping (but permitting only 10 trees to 
be held at each step) found only one island at 
maximum parsimony (i.e., all trees could be found 
by single branch swaps using any one of them as 
a starting tree; cf. Maddison, 1991). Additional as 
well as shorter islands could still exist but are un- 
likely after 2,000 repetitions (this type of search 
required about 24 hours to complete on a Mac- 
intosh Quadra 950 with 20 MB of RAM). After 
random addition searches were completed, the trees

----- Page 13 (native) -----

Annals of the 
Missouri Botanical Garden 
found were used as starting points in a single anal- 
ysis with MULPARS on and TBR swapping to 
completion; this process should find all equally par- 
simonious trees in the single island identified. Our 
search found 36 equally parsimonious Fitch trees, 
three of which were optimal under the weighting 
criterion of Albert et al. (1993, this issue; see 
Materials and Methods). One of these was randomly 
selected and is shown with Fitch branch lengths 
(ACCTRAN optimization; Fig. 16). The tree length 
was 2,234 steps, the C. I. was 0.288 (excluding 
unique characters), and the R. I. was 0.532. The 
maximum parsimony trees also were used to search 
for trees up to five steps less parsimonious under 
the Fitch criterion; the FILTER TREES option was 
used to identify trees at each length, and a strict 
consensus tree at each step was computed. The 
number of steps less parsimonious at which each 
topological component decayed was recorded (Fig. 
16; "decay values" are shown below the branches: 
"dO" indicates that the branch is a polytomy in 
the strict consensus of the maximum parsimony 
trees, "dl" indicates that the branch is a polytomy 
in the consensus tree at one step less parsimonious, 
etc.). 
This analysis identified eight lineages into which 
members of Hamamelidae fell (Fig. 16): Eucom- 
mia, lade A, sister to Aucuba (Cornaceae) and 
Garrya (Garryaceae) and nested within an asterid 
lade; Hamamelidaceae, Cercidiphyllaceae, etc., 
lade B, in a series paraphyletic to Saxifragaceae- 
Grossulariaceae; Fagales, etc., lade C, sister to 
Fabaceae-Polygalaceae; Urticales, lade D, sister 
to Rosaceae; Leitneria, lade E, nested within fam- 
ilies of Sapindales; isolated Trochodendrales, lade 
F, sister to Buxaceae; Platanus, lade G, situated 
in a heterogeneous group; and the last, Euptelea, 
lade H, situated among Ranunculales. Many of 
these clades are well supported internally, decaying 
at three or more steps less parsimonious (some, 
such as Trochodendrales-Buxaceae and the Plat- 
anus assemblage are weakly supported as mono- 
phyletic lineages but clearly are not members of 
other well supported groups, leaving them in iso- 
lated positions apart from other Hamamelidae). 
Results of this restricted analysis are congruent 
with the topology found in the broad searches (Figs. 
1, 2) and indicate the level of internal support 
demonstrated by rbcL data. Future studies could 
combine morphological data with this molecular 
matrix and perform constraint experiments in which 
various rearrangements of these taxa are examined 
for their relative degrees of parsimony. The general 
conclusion from this example is that the Hama- 
melidae do not form a monophyletic lineage; they 
are shown to be grossly polyphyletic. Besides the 
amentiferous syndrome, the major trait of Ham- 
amelidae is the presence of tannins, which is like- 
wise compatible with a relationship to the other 
tannin-containing families, Fabaceae, Rosaceae, 
Saxifragaceae sensu stricto, and Crassulaceae. 
Many authors (e.g., in Crane & Blackmore, 1989) 
have discussed these families in terms of which are 
"lower" and which are "higher" families. This 
distinction finds some support from these results; 
the "lower" groups either stand in an isolated po- 
sition near the base of the eudicots (Eupteleaceae, 
Platanaceae, and Tetracentraceae-Trochodendra- 
ceae) or basal within rosids (rosid IV, Fig. 2A; 
Daphniphyllaceae, Hamamelidaceae, and Cercidi- 
phyllaceae), whereas most "higher" hamamelids 
(Casuarinaceae, Fagaceae, Moracae, Ulmaceae, and 
Urticaceae) demonstrate a well supported relation- 
ship to Fabaceae or Rosaceae (d > 5 on two 
branches at the base of the largest lade in Fig. 
16). The position of Leitneria in Sapindales near 
Burseraceae is corroborated by a shared suite of 
secondary compounds and presence of intercellular 
resin canals. 
The example presented above is not intended to 
be more than a superficial phylogenetic treatment 
of families traditionally referred to Hamamelidae. 
It is meant to serve as an example of how the 
general topology, which itself is suspected of being 
suboptimal and presently cannot be examined by 
decay analysis because of its size, may identify a 
relevant analysis within which questions of opti- 
mality and relative support can be addressed. We 
are pleased that general relationships found in the 
broad analyses hold up well when addressed in this 
and other more restricted investigations, none of 
which have found vastly different topologies. 
ON THE INFORMATIVENESS OF ALL SUBSTITUTIONS 
The majority of character-state changes in pro- 
tein-coding genes have been demonstrated to occur 
at third positions within codons, and numerous 
empirical studies have shown third position substi- 
tutions to be more abundant in this and other data 
sets. Some workers have experimented with dis- 
carding third position substitutions from their anal- 
yses or analyzing nucleotide sequences inferred 
from amino acid data (which standardizes all syn- 
onymous substitutions; Martin & Dowd, 1991). In 
several studies (Conti et al., 1993, this issue; Don- 
oghue et al., 1992; Kim et al., 1992; Smith et al., 
1993, this issue), all three codon positions have 
been found to exhibit similar levels of homoplasy 
(and perhaps similar rates of change per site as

To gain a measure of the robustness of the 
topology, decay of parsimony (Bremer, 1988) was 
examined. All maximum parsimony trees of both 
islands were used as starting trees to search for 
trees up to five steps less parsimonious; the FILTER 
TREES option was used to identify trees at each 
length, and a strict consensus tree was computed 
at each step. The number of steps less parsimonious 
at which a branch collapsed was recorded as the 
decay index. The larger the number, the more 
robust a branch. A decay index of 1 indicates that 
the branch is present in all maximum parsimony 
trees but collapses at maximum parsimony plus 
one step. 
Search D. 
There has been great interest in 
recent cladistic studies to determine the basalmost 
lineage of angiosperms. The Nymphaeales are often 
claimed as a sister group to all other angiosperms 
(Donoghue & Doyle, 1989; Hamby & Zimmer, 
1992), but our results did not place them in such 
a position. To evaluate the hypothesis of Nym- 
phaeles being the basalmost angiosperms, we per- 
formed a topology constraint experiment using the 
same set of taxa as in Search B, but with the 
Nymphaeales constrained to be sister to all other 
angiosperms (using the CONSTRAINTS option of 
PAUP). The search was conducted under the Fitch 
criterion using 2,000 random sequence additions 
in the same manner as described in Search B. This 
is a more accurate means to determine the loss of 
parsimony associated with an alternate topology; 
merely constraining the topology based on the 
shortest trees found overall without performing 
branch swapping is likely to result in an inaccurate 
assessment of tree length because it does not permit 
character transformations to be optimized on dif- 
ferent branches than in the unconstrained trees. 
RESULTS 
Search A. 
A strict consensus tree was com- 
puted from 3,900 equally parsimonious trees at a 
length of 16,305 steps (Chase et al., 1993). These 
trees have a consistency index (C.I.; for potentially 
synapomorphous characters) of 0.102 and a re- 
tention index (R.I.) of 0.638; a summary of this 
tree is shown in Figure 1 (for the detailed version 
of the strict consensus tree, see Chase et al., 1993). 
Exclusive of Ceratophyllum, which is sister to all 
other flowering plants, the angiosperms are split 
into two clades that correspond to the two general 
pollen types, monosulcate and tricolpate (for the 
sake of convenience, we refer to angiosperms with 
monosulcate and monosulcate-derived pollen types 
as the "monosulcates" and those with tricolpate 
and tricolpate-derived pollen types as the "eudi- 
cots," the latter in accord with Doyle & Hotton's, 
1991, use of that term). Five major lineages are 
identified among the Magnoliidae; they are roughly 
equal to the Magnoliales, Laurales, Piperales (in- 
cluding Aristolochiaceae and Lactoridaceae), Nym- 
phaeales (excluding Nelumbonaceae but including 
Amborellaceae, Austrobaileyaceae, Chloranthace- 
ae, and Illiciales), and Ranunculales (excluding 
Coriariaceae, Sargentodoxaceae, and Sabiaceae but 
including Eupteleaceae, Fumariaceae, and Papav- 
eraceae). (We will use these ordinal circumscrip- 
tions throughout the rest of this paper; i.e., under 
Piperales we will include Aristolochiaceae and Lac- 
toridaceae, unless stated otherwise.) The four mag- 
noliid lineages with monosulcate pollen types, (i) 
Magnoliales, (ii) Laurales, (iii) Piperales, and (iv) 
Nymphaeales, plus the monocots (with the same 
type of pollen), form a lade. The Illiciales, which 
have anomalous tricolpate pollen (see below), also 
fall into this monosulcate lade. The Piperales are 
sister to all other monosulcates; Magnoliales/Nym- 
phaeales, Laurales, and monocots form an unre- 
solved trichotomy in the strict consensus tree. The 
Ranunculales, Nelumbonaceae, and Sabiaceae, all 
of which have tricolpate pollen, together with other 
angiosperms possessing the same pollen type, form 
a monophyletic group. This large lade corresponds 
to Walker & Doyle's (1975) nonmagnoliid dicots 
or Doyle & Hotton's (1991) "eudicots." The Ra- 
nunculales are sister to the rest of the eudicots. In 
another basal lineage of eudicots are Nelumbona- 
ceae and Sabiaceae (with Platanaceae and Protea- 
ceae; hamamelid I, Fig. 1). The Coriariaceae and 
Sargentodoxaceae are not affiliated with the Mag- 
noliidae, the former being sister to the lade of 
Cucurbitaceae/Begoniaceae/Datiscaceae and the 
latter imbedded in the Fabaceae (both in rosid I, 
Fig. 1; also see fig. lIB in Chase et al., 1993). 
Search B. 
A single island of 46 trees at a 
length of 3,414 steps with C.I. of 0.275 (unique 
substitutions excluded) and R.I. of 0.566 was found. 
One of these maximum parsimony trees favored 
by the weighting criterion (Albert et al., 1993) is 
shown with Fitch branch lengths optimized on it 
(ACCTRAN optimization; Fig. 2). Even though far 
fewer taxa (82 species) were used in Search B, the 
same general topology as Search A was obtained. 
Search C. 
Two islands of 89 and 3 trees 
respectively, at a length of 2,674 steps with C.I. 
of 0.346 (unique substitutions excluded) and R.I. 
of 0.531 were found. For illustration, one tree from 
each island was selected using the weighting cri- 
terion of Albert et al. (1993). The trees in the

using relative rate tests (Gaut et al., 1992) dem- 
onstrated five-fold variation for rbcL, which still 
falls within the range cited above. Although 5-10- 
fold differences in rates would appear potentially 
to contribute enormous branch-length differences, 
the small overall rates involved mean that great 
divergence times would be a more important factor. 
In addition, differences in rates appear to be highly 
lineage-correlated (for example, in graminoids; Gaut 
et al., 1992) rather than random, and if more 
extensive sampling at lower taxonomic levels is 
possible in these "fast" clades, then effects of rate 
differences can be offset. 
Most if not all rbcL rates will probably exist 
within a relatively narrow "window," perhaps ap- 
proximating the range illustrated above (10-1lO 
10-11, V. A. Albert, M. W. Chase & J. F. Wendel, 
unpublished). If that is correct, lineage-specific rate 
inequalities are unlikely to be a primary factor in 
branch attraction; rather, asymmetrical divergence 
times would be implicated because the product of 
rate and time is the central parameter in consid- 
erations of potential systematic errors (see Albert 
et al., 1993, this issue). Thus uneven sampling or 
extinction of lineages may present greater problems 
than do differences in rates. 
EFFECTS OF LATERAL GENOME TRANSFER, ANCESTRAL 
POLYMORPHISMS, AND DIFFERENT 
MODES OF INHERITANCE 
The trees presented here represent only infor- 
mation from a single gene, and factors peculiar to 
its evolution could lead to erroneous results. Several 
of these phenomena are discussed below, but we 
feel that their impact is likely minimal. Genome 
transfers would result in all or parts of a genome 
being phylogenetically coherent (transferred as a 
unit) at the time transit occurs (Doyle, 1992; Riese- 
berg & Soltis, 1991), but before and after move- 
ment most characters within genomes evolve in- 
dependently (although still linked if on the same 
chromosome) and ought to be expected to contain 
historical evidence. Hybridization is unlikely to in- 
fluence phylogenetic analyses except at lower tax- 
onomic levels. Even matings between divergent 
parents still occur within portions of families (and 
usually among closely related species in a genus) 
rather than between families. Parental taxa at the 
time of an ancient hybridization also were likely 
closely related, and in these genomes highly con- 
served loci, such as rbcL, would have been similar 
or even identical. 
Ancestral polymorphisms (Pamilo & Nei, 1988; 
Wu, 1991; Doyle, 1992) also affect only closely 
related taxa, and, like the effects of ancient hy- 
bridization, those of ancient polymorphisms would 
likely be minor relative to subsequent genetic di- 
vergence. If lineages that contain polymorphisms 
diverged in a closely spaced manner and uneven 
sorting did take place, it is unlikely that any evi- 
dence of such variation within a progenitor could 
be identified as such over the great amounts of 
time involved in this study. Furthermore, poly- 
morphisms are short-lived and are undocumented 
for conservative, single-copy loci, such as rbcL. 
At most these effects would be highly localized 
among groups of closely related terminal taxa and, 
with adequate taxon sampling, would not be ex- 
pected to perturb greatly the results. 
Lateral transfers not involving exchange of ga- 
metes (by unknown mechanisms) may have oc- 
curred between major lineages in the past (i.e., of 
rbcL from a purple bacterium to a red algal an- 
cestor; Morden et al., 1992). Such transfers pres- 
ently appear rare among land plants and seed plants 
in particular; furthermore, artificial transforma- 
tions are relatively difficult and often have a de- 
stabilizing or transient effect on transformed plants. 
While we must admit that this is an unknown area 
that could have played a role in certain anomalous 
placements in the rbcL trees (e.g., Montinia and 
Vahlia of Saxifragaceae sensu lato among asterids; 
Fig. 15), at the same time we are not prepared to 
advocate it as a scenario until trees based on other 
data demonstrate a pattern consistent with such 
hypotheses (as in the example of Morden et al., 
1992). Using evidence from studies of secondary 
chemistry and development, Morgan & Soltis 
(1993, this issue) build strong cases for the highly 
dispersed groupings found in their study of Saxi- 
fragaceae sensu lato. Furthermore, many of their 
findings were also congruent with recent investi- 
gations of non-molecular characters. Rather than 
resorting to explanations involving lateral transfers 
of chloroplasts by mechanisms about which we can 
only speculate, we would prefer first to examine 
specific cases from a cladistic perspective rather 
than from that of current taxonomic schemes. 
An rbcL tree is not solely a maternal tree. Al- 
though chloroplast transmission is principally ma- 
ternal and uniparental, several groups exhibit a 
paternal (e.g., conifers) or biparental pattern (Neale 
et al., 1986; Szmidt et al., 1987; Whatley, 1982; 
Wagner et al., 1987; Corriveau & Coleman, 1988; 
White, 1990; Owens & Morris, 1991). Others that 
have been thought most probably maternal, such 
as Liriodendron and Magnolia (Corriveau & Cole- 
man, 1988), consistently exhibit 5-15% paternal 
inheritance (Sewell et al., 1993). The potential

Phylogenetics of Seed Plants 
effects of a mixed pattern of inheritance on gene 
trees are also unlikely to affect studies at interfam- 
ilial levels and above. 
GENES VERSUS TAXA 
One of the more persistent controversies sur- 
rounding molecular phylogenetic studies has cen- 
tered on whether results, at a given taxonomic 
level, will be "improved" more by adding additional 
taxa sequenced for the same gene or by adding 
sequence analyses of additional genes for the same 
set of taxa (analyzed simultaneously or each per- 
formed independently for assessments of congru- 
ence; Pamilo & Nei, 1988; Wu, 1991). From the 
standpoint of corroboration, phylogenetic studies 
of other data sets are absolutely crucial. Never- 
theless, it seems quite clear from our work on these 
data sets that ideas of relationships have changed 
considerably as more taxa have been added. We 
suspect that no single gene sequence can provide 
reasonable hypotheses of relationships of seed plants 
when sampled uncritically and superficially, but 
perhaps erroneous results from one locus would be 
"corrected" by stronger signals present in the oth- 
ers. Data to evaluate this most critical question do 
not exist: would separately analyzing 20 gene se- 
quences for the same set of 25 to 30 taxa produce 
well supported relationships? 
We are convinced that adding representatives 
of the still numerous and diverse families absent 
from this analysis has the potential to enhance 
assessments of relationships at all levels (despite 
obvious computational complications). A great deal 
of the variation present within the gene still remains 
to be sampled taxonomically. Studies in several 
groups of plants indicate that rbcL often can be 
valuable at rather low taxonomic levels (Albert, in 
press, in the slipper orchids; S. Graham, B. Morton 
& S. Barrett, unpublished, in Eichhornia; R. Price 
& J. Palmer, unpublished, in Pelargonium; S. 
Williams & M. Chase, submitted, in Drosera; Xi- 
ang et al., 1993, this issue, in Cornus). What can 
be concluded from these studies is that although 
it is absolutely critical that more genes be studied 
to provide corroboration, it is unlikely that any of 
these studies will make a contribution to under- 
standing seed-plant relationships if the level of sam- 
pling is too sparse. Only empirical studies will ul- 
timately 
resolve 
the ""genes versus 
taxa" 
controversy. We estimate that by the time this 
paper is in print, more than 1,200 sequences of 
rbcL from seed plants will exist, and future studies 
will undoubtedly benefit from this enormous da- 
tabase. 
An additional implication of adding more taxa 
is that the results presented here may not be stable 
or reflective of those of an analysis of two, three, 
or four times as many sequences. We point to two 
regions of the general topology that are morpho- 
logically quite heterogeneous and that we believe 
are possibly generated by undersampling: hama- 
melid II (Figs. 2A, B, 7A, B) and rosid I (Figs. 
2A, B, 1 A, B, C). In the former, the critical taxa 
needed to provide more appropriate relationships 
could be some of the still-unsampled families, but 
these groups (represented by Lambertia, Nelumbo, 
Platanus, and Sabia) could just as likely represent 
the isolated relicts of now largely extinct lineages. 
In the case of rosid I, only a small percentage of 
the families has been sampled (for instance, only 
7 of 24 families in the Violales: Dilleniidae), and 
it is in such a case that we might predict "curious" 
sister-group relationships. Topological instability 
often occurs in cases where long terminal branches 
are next to short internal branches, that is, hy- 
pothesized relationships are drastically altered by 
the addition of related taxa that "break up" long 
branches. Two surprising pairs of sister taxa from 
Search I, Erythroxylum-Viola and Ochna-Dry- 
petes, are quite divergent and connected to each 
other by relatively short branches (Fig. 1 IA; branch 
lengths shown only in 11 B). In Search II, the 
addition of Reinwardtia displaced Erythroxylum 
from Viola to Drypetes, leaving Ochna to stand 
isolated from any other taxon (Fig. 1I B). In such 
situations, assessments of relationships are difficult, 
but, as more closely related species are added, 
distinguishing synapomorphies for families and 
groups of families as distinct from autapomorphies 
for individual species will become more reliable. 
We would not argue that the relationships found 
for rosid I are "better" in Search I than in Search 
II (or vice versa), but rather point these out as 
areas of the trees that require additional sampling 
and in which many of the relationships suggested 
by these analyses of rbcL have little or no mor- 
phological support. 
VALUE OF THE BROAD ANALYSIS 
We view the relatively robust internal support 
found by evaluations of portions of the broad anal- 
ysis as an indication that rbcL sequences contain 
information relevant to the evolutionary history of 
angiosperms (Fig. 16, on Hamamelidae and most 
of the other papers in this issue; in particular see 
Conti et al., 1993, and Rodman et al., 1993, for 
which comparable cladistic analyses of non-molec- 
ular data are also available and compared). Well-

Missouri Botanical Garden 
characterized families and groups of families (as 
evidenced in several more restricted studies of mor- 
phology, anatomy, and secondary chemistry; e.g., 
Rodman, 1991a, b; Hufford, 1992) are largely 
congruent with our results. Other evidence sup- 
ports the monophyly of the angiosperms (Doyle & 
Donoghue, 1986, 1992), monocots (Dahlgren et 
al., 1985), and eudicots (Donoghue & Doyle, 1989). 
Likewise, the position of Ceratophyllum as sister 
to the rest of the angiosperms compares favorably 
with the fossil record (Les, 1988; fossil fruits from 
120 million years ago are identical to extant fruits, 
D. Dilcher, pers. comm.). The status of the families 
of the Papaverales-Ranunculales collectively as 
sister to the rest of the eudicots (Figs. 1, 2) also 
finds ample external support (Donoghue & Doyle, 
1989, among others). 
The results reported here do find some "sur- 
prising" relationships. Several families, such as 
Chenopodiaceae (Fig. 9A, B) and Berberidaceae 
with only two representatives each in our studies, 
are paraphyletic to other families. These results do 
not surprise us because sampling has been dem- 
onstrated repeatedly to be a major factor, and 
insufficient or uneven sampling can generate anom- 
alous relationships. Concomitantly, our results em- 
phasize the need for studies of familial limits to 
include much better taxon sampling than is gen- 
erally the case in these two analyses. Some of these 
instances of paraphyly may be accurate; many 
pairs of temperate, herbaceous/woody, tropical 
families have long been suspected of being unnat- 
ural (for example, Lamiaceae are derived within 
Verbenaceae and Brassicaceae within Capparaceae 
in our studies). 
Other "major" findings of this study, although 
discordant when viewed from the perspective of 
various taxonomic treatments, find support from 
recent studies of non-molecular characters. For 
example, the placement of Ericales as sister to 
asterids (Figs. 1, 2) was also found by Hufford 
(1992), and the monophyly of most mustard-oil 
families (Fig. 1 A, B) was previously suggested by 
Rodman (1991 b). Other sets of relationships are 
unique to this analysis and require more thorough 
morphological and molecular studies. These in- 
clude: (i) the position of several families with poly- 
petalous corollas and supposed affinities to Saxi- 
fragaceae among each major lineage of Asteridae 
(requiring a hypothesized reversal of the sympet- 
alous condition in Escallonia, Montinia, Phyllono- 
ma, and Vahlia (all Saxifragaceae sensu lato); (ii) 
nesting of dilleniid orders Capparales, Malvales, 
Theales, and Violales among rosid clades (the sys- 
tems of both Dahlgren, 1980, and Thorne, 1992, 
treated these groups in a manner somewhat similar 
to our topology); (iii) relationships of Nepenthaceae 
and Droseraceae to Caryophyllidae sensu lato (Fig. 
9A, B); and (iv) specific associations of numerous 
problematic genera like Dillenia (among rosids near 
Caryophyllidae, Fig. 9A, or near the base of the 
asterids, Fig. 12B; see Olmstead et al., 1993, this 
issue), Impatiens (near members of Ebenales and 
Ericales; Fig. 13A, B), and Nelumbo and Lam- 
bertia (among lower hamamelids; Fig. 7A, B). 
Placement of most of these genera and families 
has varied substantially among recently proposed 
classifications (although no one has suggested the 
relationships found here), and their positions in this 
study will undoubtedly add to the controversies. 
Because additional lineages were present in 
Search II and different methods were used to con- 
struct the trees, it is impossible to evaluate whether 
the topology found in Search II represents a dif- 
ferent island of trees. Indeed, multiple islands of 
equally parsimonious trees were found in other 
studies in this issue: Morgan & Soltis (1993), Olm- 
stead et al. (1993), and Qiu et al. (1993). Certainly 
shifts of some taxa, especially Paeonia from a basal 
asterid to sister of Crassulaceae and Saxifragaceae 
sensu stricto, suggest a radically different expla- 
nation of the distribution of at least some char- 
acters. Paeonia is well supported internally in its 
new position (its sister status to Ribes does not 
decay even at five steps less parsimonious; Fig. 
16). Shifts of Dillenia, Gunnera, Santalales, and 
Vitis seem, at first glance, to be major alterations 
of position, but branches are so short near the split 
between asterids and rosids that these could not 
involve many additional steps in either topology 
(Fig. 2B). 
Although the trees of Search II are preferred 
to those of Search I because some of them were 
swapped on to completion and therefore are more 
likely to represent at least a local optimum, tax- 
onomic conclusions based on either search are un- 
timely. When faced with the fact that large num- 
bers of angiosperm families are still unrepresented 
in the rbcL data set, we would argue that a valid 
assessment of the most appropriate positions of 
many taxa, such as Dillenia, Gunnera, and Vitis, 
grossly premature. Some conclusions, polyphyly of 
Hamamelidae and Dilleniidae, for example, seem 
well supported now. 
This study is noteworthy not only for its scope 
but also for the large number of contributors whose 
unpublished sequences made up the bulk of the 
data analyzed. This wide collaboration was advan- 
tageous to all workers; many found that taxa se- 
quenced by other laboratories supposedly working

Phylogenetics of Seed Plants 
on distantly related groups (in recent taxonomic 
schemes) fell into or near their group of interest. 
Prime examples of this are the close phylogenetic 
relationship of Nepenthaceae and Droseraceae to 
families of Caryophyllidae, Pittosporaceae to Api- 
aceae-Araliaceae, Malvales and Capparales (both 
"dilleniids") to Sapindales, and Corokia (Corna- 
ceae) to Asteraceae. 
Broad analyses are thus important in providing 
evaluations of a priori assumptions about appro- 
priate sets of study taxa for more focused and 
rigorous studies; they should be formalized so that 
someone takes the initiative to perform them. Gov- 
ernmental funding agencies should facilitate stud- 
ies, such as the one presented here, that are well 
beyond the scope of individual laboratories. This 
study demonstrates the potential of this kind of 
analysis, but no single individual or laboratory could 
have received formal support for sampling this 
diverse set of taxa and performing the phylogenetic 
analysis; it would have been deemed by reviewers 
too broad and too unfocused. Although extramural 
funds supported most of the other studies in this 
issue, no support was received specifically for the 
broad analysis. It is the investment in individual 
studies that justifies a further expenditure to sup- 
port syntheses that supply an essential overall per- 
spective, even though they may be necessarily 
approximate. 
The benefits of performing this largest-yet phy- 
logenetic study of seed plants lie not only in support 
of specific relationships hypothesized by other stud- 
ies (e.g., the sister group status of the Ericales 
and higher asterids proposed by Hufford, 1992) 
and in identification of previously unhypothesized 
monophyletic groups. This study also presents a 
comprehensive, explicit hypothesis for higher level 
relationships, permitting and encouraging initiation 
of studies evaluating other character systems that 
may show congruence with the major lineages of 
seed plants described here. We have performed 
none of the essential experiments that these results 
suggest (topological constraints, removal of char- 
acters, combining morphological with molecular 
data, etc.) and have not developed implications 
these topologies may have for specific character 
transformations in seed plants or molecular evo- 
lution of rbcL or RuBisCO. Believing that serious 
consideration of the significance of these general 
topologies is best handled at the more manifest 
level of other papers published here (and else- 
where), we have chosen instead to emphasize rea- 
sons for caution. We are content to present the 
findings of these studies as examples of potential 
benefits and pitfalls of such exercises. At the least, 
these analyses represent an attempt to improve 
both our understanding of seed-plant evolution and 
methods of phylogenetic inference. Corroboration 
by other data sets analyzed in a similar fashion is 
by far the most significant measure of relationships 
proposed here, and we hope this process of eval- 
uation will be innervated by our efforts.

FIGURE 2. 
Summaries of the same topologies as in Figure 1. In B, Fitch branch lengths are optimized from a 
single tree; optimization on consensus trees is likely to overestimate branch lengths. Names of the specific clades 
identified do not conform to the composition of families used in most taxonomic schemes, but rather are designated 
with respect to the components of the major lineages (i.e., by the subclass name for the majority of taxa included, 
except for the heterogeneous hamamelid I, which is so designated because of its position and inclusion of Platanaceae). 
Names of each clade correspond to groups shown in Figures 3-15. Clades marked with a "?" in B are those that 
differ significantly in position or composition from A.

FIGURE 4. 
Basal portion of the overall analysis showing the positions of Ceratophyllaceae (inaperturate pollen), 
monocots (uniaperturate pollen), eudicots (dicots with triaperturate pollen), and the three clades of "primitive" dicots 
(monosulcate pollen). Note that, exclusive of Ceratophyllum, the angiosperms form two sister groups marked by the 
general pollen aperture number (one versus three). (Numbers above the branches in B are the numbers of substitutions 
optimized onto one tree randomly selected from the 3,900 saved in Search II.) Genera marked with a "t" in A were 
omitted from Search II; genera marked with an asterisk in B were not available for Search I. The "Canella" in this 
figure represents the position of two sequences amplified from a total cellular DNA template (see Materials & Methods). 
Note that A is the consensus tree of Search I, whereas B is a single tree with branches not present in the strict 
consensus of Search II marked by an arrow.

substitutions optimized onto one tree randomly selected from the 3,900 saved in Search II.) Genera marked with a 
"t" in A were omitted from Search II; genera marked with an asterisk in B were not available for Search I. Note 
that A is the consensus tree of Search I, whereas B is a single tree with branches not present in the strict consensus 
of Search II marked by an arrow.

The second "higher" rosid lineage. (Numbers above the branches in B and C, see foldout, are the 
numbers of substitutions optimized onto one tree randomly selected from the 3,900 saved in Search II.) Genera 
marked with a "t" in A were omitted from Search II; genera marked with an asterisk in B and C were not available 
for Search I. The taxon labeled "Kirengoshoma" was, subsequent to Search I, discovered to be misidentified and 
was removed from Search II; its identity is unknown. Note that A is the consensus tree of Search I, whereas B and 
C are a single tree with branches not present in the strict consensus of Search II marked by an arrow.
