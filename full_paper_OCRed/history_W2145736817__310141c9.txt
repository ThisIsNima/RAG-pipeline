The Danger Model: A Renewed
Sense of Self
Polly Matzinger
For over 50 years immunologists have based their thoughts, experiments,
and clinical treatments on the idea that the immune system functions by
making a distinction between self and nonself. Although this paradigm has
often served us well, years of detailed examination have revealed a
number of inherent problems. This Viewpoint outlines a model of immu-
nity based on the idea that the immune system is more concerned with
entities that do damage than with those that are foreign.
First, do no harm.
–Hippocratic oath
Of all the mysteries in modern science, the
mechanisms of self versus nonself recognition
in the immune system ranks at or near the
top.
–D. E. Koshland Jr. (1)
As a graduate student, I was taught that
the immune system functions by discriminat-
ing between self (defined early in life) and
nonself (anything that comes later), tolerating
self and attacking nonself. Although this el-
egantly simple idea seemed to make a lot of
sense, it had problems from the beginning
and has failed over the years to explain a
great number of findings. For example, what
happens when “self” changes? How do or-
ganisms go through puberty, metamorphosis,
pregnancy, and aging without attacking new-
ly changed tissues? Why do mammalian
mothers not reject their fetuses or attack their
newly lactating breasts, which produce milk
proteins that were not part of earlier “self”?
Why do we fail to make immune responses to
vaccines composed of inert foreign proteins
unless we add noxious substances, collective-
ly known as “adjuvants”? Why do we fail to
reject tumors, even when many clearly ex-
press new or mutated proteins? Why do most
of us harbor autoreactive lymphocytes with-
out any sign of autoimmune disease, while a
few individuals succumb?
To answer some of these questions, I pro-
posed the Danger model, which suggests that
the immune system is more concerned with
damage than with foreignness, and is called
into action by alarm signals from injured
tissues, rather than by the recognition of non-
self (2, 3). In the intervening 7 years, in
conversations with a wide variety of people, I
discovered that this simple idea not only of-
fers answers to broad immunological ques-
tions, it also covers many details that had not
been incorporated into previous models [for
example, why major histocompatibility com-
plex (MHC)–mismatched kidney transplants
from living donors often perform better than
MHC-compatible kidneys from cadavers (4);
why liver transplants are rejected less vigor-
ously than hearts; why women seem to be
more susceptible than men to certain autoim-
mune diseases; why Rh disease of the new-
born is a problem in the second pregnancy,
but not the first; why graft-versus-host dis-
ease is less severe in recipients that have had
gentle rather than harsh preconditioning treat-
ments (5, 6); and so on] without adding
special new situation-specific assumptions.
This Viewpoint will first trace the history
of the self-nonself (SNS) model, showing
how it had to be modified over the years to
accommodate new data, then give a brief
description of the Danger model, and show
how it is leading us to a new way of thinking
about self-recognition. Those readers who
may already have encountered some of these
concepts (2, 7–9) will find more details in the
supplementary Web material on Science On-
line (10).
The Self-Nonself Models
Burnet’s original model (11) suggested (Fig.
1) that (i) each lymphocyte expresses multi-
ple copies of a single surface receptor specif-
ic for a foreign entity, (ii) signaling through
this surface antibody initiates the immune
response, and (iii) the self-reactive lympho-
cytes are deleted early in life [based on
Owen’s discovery that nonidentical cattle
twins were mutually tolerant of each other’s
blood cells (12)]. This straightforward model
gained general acceptance when Medawar et
al. found that adult mice would accept for-
eign skin grafts if they had been injected as
babies with cells from the donors (13). In
1960, Burnet and Medawar shared the Nobel
Prize for their work, and the SNS discrimi-
nation model has dominated the field ever
since.
The original SNS model has changed,
however, to accommodate incompatible new
findings. It was first modified in 1969, after
the discovery that activated B lymphocytes
hypermutate, creating new, potentially self-
reactive cells. Realizing that autoimmunity
would be rare if immunity required the coop-
eration of two cells, Bretscher and Cohn (14)
added a new cell (the helper, later found to be
a T cell) and a new signal (help), proposing
that the B cell would die if it recognized
antigen in the absence of help (Fig. 1B). In
1975, Lafferty and Cunningham (15) dealt
with the finding that T cells respond more
strongly against foreign cells of their own
species than against cells of another species,
by adding another cell and another signal.
They proposed that T cells also need a second
signal (named “costimulation”), which they
receive from “stimulator” cells [now called
antigen-presenting cells (APCs)], and sug-
gested that this signal is species specific (Fig.
1C).
The Infectious-Nonself (INS) Model
The need for costimulation posed a major
problem for SNS models. If, as they assumed,
the decision to respond is made by antigen-
specific cells, and if self-reactive ones are
deleted, then immunity can be directed
against nonself. If, however, responses are
initiated by APCs, which are not antigen
specific (they capture all sorts of self and
foreign substances), then immunity cannot be
directed only against nonself. The concept of
costimulation was therefore essentially ig-
nored until it was rediscovered experimental-
ly by Jenkins and Schwartz in 1986 (16). In
1989, Janeway offered an ingenious solution
(17), suggesting that APCs have their own
form of SNS discrimination and can recog-
nize evolutionarily distant pathogens. He pro-
posed that APCs are quiescent (a very impor-
tant and previously unappreciated point) until
they are activated via a set of germ line–
encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs)
that recognize conserved pathogen-associated
molecular patterns (PAMPs) on bacteria. On
activation, APCs up-regulate costimulatory
signals, process the bacterial antigens, and
present them to passing T cells (Fig. 1D). The
PRRs, he wrote, allow APCs to discriminate
between “infectious-nonself” and “noninfec-
tious-self” (18).
Although the essence of SNS recognition
was temporarily saved, Janeway’s infectious-
nonself (INS) model created new complexi-
ties while solving old problems. It could not
explain why viruses stimulate immunity, why
transplants are rejected, what induces autoim-

munity, why tumors are sometimes spontane-
ously rejected, or how nonbacterial adju-
vants, such as alum, work. Over the years,
Janeway’s model has been modified to ac-
count for some of these issues (see Viewpoint
by Medzhitov and Janeway in this issue)
(19), suggesting, for example, that viral dou-
ble-stranded mRNA is a signature of foreign-
ness. What then of viruses that do not gener-
ate double-stranded RNA, adjuvants that do
not incorporate bacterial products, trans-
plants, and autoimmunity? Even with all of
the modifications that SNS/INS models have
undergone over the years, they still have dif-
ficulty with some of these fundamental pro-
cesses.
The Danger Model
Standing on the shoulders of the SNS models,
the Danger model added another layer of
cells and signals (2), proposing that APCs are
activated by danger/alarm signals from in-
jured cells, such as those exposed to patho-
gens, toxins, mechanical damage, and so
forth (Fig. 1e). Although purely theoretical at
the time (20), many alarm signals have since
been empirically revealed (9). Alarm signals
can be constitutive or inducible, intracellular
or secreted, or even a part of the extracellular
matrix. Because cells dying by normal pro-
grammed processes are usually scavenged
before they disintegrate, whereas cells that
die necrotically release their contents, any
intracellular product could potentially be a
danger signal when released. Inducible alarm
signals could include any substance made, or
modified, by distressed or injured cells. The
important feature is that danger/alarm signals
should not be sent by healthy cells or by cells
undergoing normal physiological deaths.
Although this may seem to be just one more
step down the path of slowly increasingly com-
plex cellular interactions, this small step drops
us off a cliff, landing us in a totally different
viewpoint, in which the “foreignness” of a
pathogen is not the important feature that trig-
gers a response, and “self-ness” is no guarantee
of tolerance. The surprising explanatory and
predictive power of this model provides insight
into many of the things that the immune system
does right, as well as many of the things it
seems to get wrong (21).
Danger Signals: Common Ground for
the INS and Danger Models?
Although they differ greatly in detail, both
the INS and the Danger models assume that
resting APCs can be activated by signals
from their immediate environment. The INS
model has found support in the recent discov-
ery of the evolutionarily conserved membrane-
bound Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which act as
PRRs for components of bacteria and fungi,
and initiate immune responses in organisms
as distant as flies and mammals (22–26).
There are presently 10 known mammalian
TLRs, which bind a wide range of biological
molecules and awaken resting APCs (27).
The Danger model has been supported by
the discovery of endogenous, nonforeign alarm
signals (9), including mammalian DNA (28),
RNA, heat shock proteins (Hsps), interferon-a

(an inducible protein often made by virus-in-
fected cells), interleukin-1b, CD40-L (a surface
molecule on activated platelets and activated T
cells), and breakdown products of hyaluron
(made when vessels are damaged).
There is no reason why APCs should not
respond to both endogenous and exogenous
signals. Vertebrates and bacteria have shared
eons of evolutionary time and space, and thus
receptors for endogenous and exogenous sig-
nals may have evolved simultaneously. In-
deed, there is evidence that these receptors
are often the same molecules. For example,
TLR4 is a receptor for the bacterial product
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the endogenous
cellular molecule Hsp70, and the extracellu-
lar breakdown products of hyaluron; TLR2
binds bacterial lipoproteins and Hsp 60; and
TLR9 binds to DNA CpG sequences (found
in all living creatures). Thus, it appears that
the TLRs can recognize both endogenous and
exogenous molecules. The binding character-
istics of a newly discovered family of intra-
cellular proteins, called nucleotide-binding
oligomerization domain (NOD) receptors, are
not yet as well worked out, but it is beginning
to appear that they too can respond to both
injury/pathogen-related signals and normal
physiological signals involved with apoptosis
(29). Indeed, one of the puzzling features of
TLRs and NODs is that each one can bind to
many different kinds of molecules. How can
one receptor—TLR4, for example—be spe-
cific for a bacterial LPS, cellular Hsp70 pro-
tein, and hyaluron?
One possibility is that we may be looking at
the PRRs completely backwards (7). Perhaps
PRRs have not evolved to bind to pathogens at
all. Perhaps the pathogens have evolved to bind
to them! Many cell surface molecules involved
in normal physiological functions are targeted
by pathogens. Human immunodeficiency virus,
for example, binds to CD4, CCR5, and CxCR4,
and Toxoplasma also seems to bind to CCR5
(30), whereas Staphylococcus and Streptococ-
cus bind to a conserved loop on T cell receptors
and to the Fc portion of antibodies. Coxsackie
virus binds to intracellular cell adhesion mole-
cule–1 (ICAM-1), rabies to N-CAM, and Ep-
stein-Barr virus to complement receptor 2, thus
activating a B cell as it enters. No one suggests
that these molecules have evolved to act as
receptors for pathogens. We assume instead
that the pathogen’s ability to bind to these
molecules serves the pathogen’s agenda, not
ours. Similarly, the PRRs may be misnamed.
For example, CD14, which recognizes ap-
optotic cells (31), has been called a PRR
because it also binds to bacterial LPS (32).
However, mice lacking CD14 resist Gram-
negative bacteria more vigorously than
their normal littermates (33), suggesting
that the LPS-CD14 interaction is more fa-
vorable to the bacterium than to the host.
Thus, perhaps TLRs and NODs originally
evolved as receptors for injury-related sig-
nals, and the microbes subsequently evolved
mechanisms to use these receptors to enhance
their own survival. From this vantage point, it
may no longer be surprising that the TLRs
bind to so many different kinds of molecule,
as each type of pathogen will have evolved its
own way of binding to a TLR.
S. Y. Seong has suggested the even more
intriguing possibility (34) that the same
alarm signals may be used by many different
organisms. Because life evolved in water, any
hydrophobic portion (Hyppo) of a given mol-
ecule is usually buried in the depths of that
molecule, or hidden in the lipid membrane of
the cell, and could act as an alarm signal if
exposed (34). For example, the hydrophobic
part of LPS is crucial for its immunostimu-
lating properties, yet LPS is normally an in-
tegral bacterial membrane molecule and its
Hyppos are hidden in the membrane. How-
ever, when released by damaged or dead
bacteria, the newly exposed Hyppos could act
as a bacterial alarm signal (or perhaps a type
of quorum sensor (35), perhaps signaling the
surviving bacteria to sporulate or otherwise
change their behavior. Plant and animal cells
also have an abundant supply of hidden Hyp-
pos in their membranes and cytoplasm. Dur-
ing protein synthesis, Hsps and other chaper-
ones bind to the Hyppos of nascent proteins
to prevent their aggregation. Should a cell be
disrupted, the Hyppos of both the nascent
proteins and their chaperones would be ex-
posed. Future evidence may show that our
immune systems may thus be using TLRs and
other receptors to respond to truly ancient
multipurpose signals of distress that cross
species barriers.
Dangerous Self and Harmless Foreign:
The Uncommon Ground Between the
Two Models
Although the INS version of the SNS models
and the Danger model have some common
features, their basic assumptions about what
initiates immunity are fundamentally differ-
ent. Is it microbial nonself or is it danger? As
nonself is sometimes dangerous, the defini-
tions overlap, but they are not identical (Fig.
2). For dangerous foreign pathogens (Fig. 2,
sets d and e) or harmless self (Fig. 2, set a),
the two models make the same predictions.
However, some things (Fig. 2, sets b and f)
are foreign but harmless (e.g., fetuses),
whereas others (Fig. 2, set c) are self but
harmful (e.g., some mutations). For these en-
tities lying outside the overlapping sets, the
INS and Danger models make different pre-
dictions, and these are therefore the interest-
ing test cases. Below I will briefly cover a
few of these (10).
Foreign entities that are not associated with
microbes include transplants and fetuses. Why
should the former be rejected and the latter not?
Although the INS model would suggest that

SNS models split all
antigens into two sets:

The

divides
anti-
gens into “noninfec-
tious self” (set a) and

existence
of
patho-
gen-associated molec-
ular patterns (PAMPs)
that are evolutionarily
conserved on patho-
gens that are evolu-
tionarily very distant
from their hosts, and
that the host APCs can
therefore have germ
line–encoded pattern
recognition receptors
(PRRs) to detect them.
It tends to ignore the
subsets b and f. The
Danger model parti-
tions
antigens
into
those associated with
dangerous entities or
harmless ones, deﬁn-
ing as dangerous anything that induces stress or nonphysiological death of a cell. Dangerous
entities may be self (set c), such as mutations that lead to stress or inappropriate cell death or
inefﬁcient scavenging; or nonself, such as pathogens (set e), environmental toxins (set d), and such.
Set f would contain evolutionarily distant organisms that have PAMPs, but that are not dangerous
(e.g., symbiotic organisms, well-adapted viruses).

neither should be rejected because they are not
associated with microbial stimulators, and the
old SNS models would suggest that both should
be rejected because they are nonself, the Dan-
ger model suggests that healthy fetuses should
not be rejected because they do not send alarm
signals. Transplants, however, cannot be per-
formed without surgical and/or ischemic dam-
age. Thus, to induce the acceptance of trans-
plants without lifelong immunosuppression, we
should mimic the body’s own way of inducing
tolerance, i.e., by blocking the endogenous
alarm and/or costimulatory signals. Most of the
current immunosuppressive drug protocols en-
deavor to block Signal One (antigen recogni-
tion). Although this effectively blindfolds the
lymphocytes, it also prevents them from be-
coming tolerant, and consequently the drugs
must be given for life. In contrast, studies in
rodents and monkeys (36–38) have shown that
short-term treatment with costimulation block-
ers, or blockers of alarm signaling (39), can
lead to long-term graft acceptance in the ab-
sence of long-term immunosuppression. Per-
haps the lower extent of damage can explain
why kidneys from living donors are accepted
more easily than those from cadavers (4). Sim-
ilarly, fetuses should not elicit immunity, in
spite of being foreign, as long as they are
healthy and do not send alarm signals (10).
Tumors are entities for which both the INS
and the Danger models have the same predic-
tion, namely, that tumors should not stimulate
immunity, either (INS) because they are not
associated with microbial stimulators, or (Dan-
ger) because they are healthy growing cells that
do not send alarm signals. Thus, to eradicate a
tumor, we should infect it (40), or cause it
repeated damage to alert the local APCs [as Bill
Coley did in the late 1800s (41, 42)], or we
should vaccinate repeatedly with a tumor vac-
cine that stimulates immunity.
For autoimmunity, the Danger model of-
fers a unique suggestion that would not arise
from the SNS or the INS models. Starting
with the view that “bad” death or cell stress
can elicit an immune response, the model
suggests that some autoimmune diseases may
be caused by mutations in genes governing
the normal physiological death and clearance
processes, or by environmental pathogens or
toxins that cause cellular stress or death. In
these cases, the immune system is not at fault;
it is doing its job of responding to alarm
signals (but, in these cases, to the detriment
of the host). If we could pinpoint these mu-
tations or environmental agents, we might be
able to reduce the incidence of autoimmune
diseases.
A Renewed Sense of Self: Expanding
the Horizons of the Danger Model
There is inherent beauty in a model that uses
very few assumptions to explain a wide variety
of phenomena. However, for me, the most in-
teresting aspect of the Danger model has been a
deep-rooted shift in thinking that it inspired. The
shift came in two phases that abruptly expanded
the model’s explanatory range. Originally con-
ceived to answer the first question the immune
system must consider when faced with a poten-
tial threat—namely, whether to respond—the
model now also offers a suggestion for the next
question—having decided to respond, what
kind of response should it make? How does the
immune system know whether to generate killer
T cells to eliminate a virus or immunoglobulin E
(IgE) antibody to catch a worm? In immunolog-
ical terms, how does it determine the effector
“class” of the response?
The first shift came from the realization
that the immune system may not be the ulti-
mate controller of immunity. Like most im-
munologists, I had thought that immunity is
controlled by the cells of the “adaptive” im-
mune system (lymphocytes) or the more an-
cient “innate” immune system (such as mac-
rophages, dendritic cells, and the complement
system). I now believe that the ultimate pow-
er lies with the tissues. When healthy, tissues
induce tolerance. When distressed, they stim-
ulate immunity, and (continuing down this
path) they may also determine the effector
class of a response. Although it has long been
thought that the effector class is tailored to
the targeted pathogen (e.g., virus or worm), I
now think that it is tailored to the tissue in
which the response occurs.
Different tissues seem to have different
means of determining the effector class of a
response. For example, the class of response
that occurs most often in the skin (e.g., after
exposure to poison ivy, TB tests, or subcutane-
ous vaccinations), called “delayed type hyper-
sensitivity” (DTH), is characterized by swell-
ing, redness, an influx of macrophages, and the
production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and
interferon-g (IFN-g). Unlike skin, however,
both the gut and the eye can be destroyed by
DTH responses, and the most common re-
sponse in these organs is the production of IgA,
an antibody found at high levels in tears, saliva,
milk, and gut secretions. To ensure that IgA is
made, and TNF and IFN-g are not, the cells of
the anterior chamber of the eye produce vaso-
active intestinal peptide (VIP) and transforming
growth factor–b (TGF-b), two cytokines that
are also made by the gut and that promote a
switch to IgA and suppress the DTH response
(43, 44). Thus, local tissue cells strongly influ-
ence the local immune response.
The second shift came from the realization
that tossing out the idea that the immune system
uses SNS discrimination to decide whether to
respond leaves us free to use self-recognition in
a positive way to control other aspects of the
response. Many organs harbor special popula-
tions of lymphocytes that appear to be evolu-
tionarily old, often have limited receptor diver-
sity, and have been called “innate lymphocytes”
because they respond to stress-induced self mol-
ecules rather than to the foreign entities seen by
the “adaptive” lymphocytes (45). These cells
have no place in the SNS and INS models, and
they have remained on the fringe of respectabil-
ity. But, seen from the standpoint that immunity
is governed by the tissues, these self-reactive
cells do not seem so odd (7), and Bendelac calls
this “autoimmunity by design” (45). For exam-
ple, the dendritic epidermal T cells (gd T cells)
found in mouse and bovine skin all express
exactly the same receptor (46), arise late in fetal
life, and emigrate in one wave to the skin, where
they settle quietly. When stimulated by the ap-
pearance of stress-induced molecules on kera-
tinocytes (47), they produce epidermal cell
growth factor, IL-2, and IFN-g. These cells are
clearly not the kind of lymphocytes we are
accustomed to. They seem to be there to pro-
duce cytokines that heal damaged skin by in-
ducing cell growth and nudging local immunity
toward a DTH. In human gut, T cells expressing
self-reactive Vd6 receptors also respond to
stress-induced molecules (48). Many other gd T
cells may be similar, responding to endogenous
stress signals rather than to foreign antigens.
T cells bearing a/b receptors can also be
usefully self-reactive. The thymus, bone mar-
row, and liver contain NK1 T cells specific for
the ancient MHC-like molecule, CD1, which is
expressed by activated but not resting APCs
(49). Activated NK1 T cells from the thymus
produce copious amounts of IL-4, a cytokine
that skews local immune responses away from
a DTH and toward the production of IgG1 and
IgE. Furthermore, T cells specific for brain
proteins can lessen the secondary damage that
follows neural injury (50).
All of these tissue-localized cells appear
to be useful self-reactive cells involved in
local immunity, and there may be many other
localized and/or circulating cells doing simi-
lar jobs. For example, a lot of effort has gone
into the search for the foreign ligands recog-
nized by circulating gd T cells. After more
than a decade, very few have been found, and
these include such ubiquitous cellular mole-
cules as polyprenyl pyrophosphate (51) and
phosphorylated nucleotides (52).
Perhaps, if we move from the idea that
every lymphocyte should be directed against
non-self antigens whose appearance stimulates
the response, and consider instead the possibil-
ity that immunity is controlled by an internal
conversation between tissues and the cells of
the immune system (53), we may regain a
renewed sense of the self that we have lost.

Up to that time, APCs were thought to be constitutively
active, but a seemingly small glitch in the behavior of
the system (the need for adjuvant) led him to suggest
that they were normally quiescent and needed to be
activated. These insights showed that theoretical biol-
ogy and physics may have more in common than is
sometimes thought.

gens are dangerous substances. Der-p1, the major aller-
gen in house dust mite, is a protease that attacks the
surface of B cells and lung epithelium. Likewise, bee
venom is not an innocuous substance. From the stand-
point of the Danger model, it is not surprising that the
immune system responds to allergens. What is not clear,
however, is why some individuals make IgG whereas
others make IgE (the antibody associated with allergy).

53. The Network model, which proposed that “self” is
deﬁned in a positive way, also emphasized the idea of
connectedness. The idea was that lymphocytes react
against each other’s antigen-speciﬁc receptors and
maintain a balance of self-reactive and foreign-reactive
cells (55). The proponents of the network have been
arguing for years that the study of single lymphocytes
is an inappropriate way to study the immune system,
but that we should study the connectivity between cells
(56) Finally, after years of ﬁnding the model intriguing,
but narrow, I agree. However, I think that we should not
limit the study to interactions between lymphocytes
but expand it to include their conversations with all the
bodily tissues, which have the ultimate say.

Recognition and Rejection of Self
in Plant Reproduction
June B. Nasrallah
Plant self-incompatibility (SI) systems are unique among self/nonself
recognition systems in being based on the recognition of self rather than
nonself. SI in crucifer species is controlled by highly polymorphic and
co-evolving genes linked in a complex. Self recognition is based on
allele-speciﬁc interactions between stigma receptors and pollen ligands
that result in the arrest of pollen tube development. Commonalities and
differences between SI and other self/nonself discrimination systems are
discussed.
The concept of self/nonself discrimination
was elaborated by Burnet (1) as a way to
describe specificity in the immune response
and is most often associated with the field of
immunology. It is perhaps less well known
that, in the plant kingdom, sophisticated self-
recognition systems have evolved that allow
plants with perfect (hermaphroditic) flowers
to
avoid
inbreeding.
These
intraspecific
prefertilization mating barriers are collective-
ly known as self-incompatibility (SI). This
term encompasses several systems that are
mechanistically distinct but have the same
outcome, namely the inhibition of self-related
pollen tube development and, consequently,
the prevention of sperm cell delivery to the
ovules.
SI systems are said to discriminate be-
tween self and nonself because they pro-
duce different outcomes in self- and cross-
pollinations. Specificity in SI is typically
controlled by one or more highly polymor-
phic genetic loci. In the context of SI, self
and nonself mean, respectively, genetic
identity and nonidentity at the SI locus (or
loci) in pistils and pollen. The outcome of
this discrimination is the converse of that of
the immune response, in which case self
has been classically defined as those ele-
ments that are tolerated and do not elicit a
response. In SI, self is the condition that
elicits the response and is inhibited, where-
as nonself is the condition that is ignored
and does not elicit a response.
A Variety of Plant SI Systems
As an advantageous outbreeding device, SI
is widely distributed in flowering plants
(2). It evolved independently in several
lineages, and the SI systems adopted by
different plant families vary with respect to
site and mechanism of self inhibition. In
self-incompatible species of the crucifer
family (e.g., Brassica species and close
relatives of Arabidopsis thaliana), SI dis-
rupts hydration and germination of a pollen
grain on the stigma epidermis, thus pre-
venting growth of pollen tubes into the
subepidermal tissues of the pistil. In other
families, SI acts after pollen germination
and pollen tube ingress into the pistil, either
within the stigmatic zone (as in the poppy
family), or later, within the style (as in the
tobacco, rose, and snapdragon families).
