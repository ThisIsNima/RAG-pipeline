A brief history of the antibiotic era: lessons learned and 
challenges for the future

This article gives a very brief overview of the antibiotic era, beginning from the discovery of 
first antibiotics until the present day situation, which is marred by the emergence of hard-to-
treat multiple antibiotic-resistant infections. The ways of responding to the antibiotic resistance 
challenges such as the development of novel strategies in the search for new antimicrobials, 
designing more effective preventive measures and, importantly, better understanding the 
ecology of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance are discussed. The expansion of conceptual 
frameworks based on recent developments in the field of antimicrobials, antibiotic resistance, 
and chemotherapy is also discussed.
Keywords: history of antibiotic discovery, antibiotic resistance, novel antimicrobials, prevention of antibiotic resistance, 
environmental resistome
for treating skin infections have led to the discovery of a number 
of antibiotic-producing bacteria and concomitant antibiotic pro-
duction in these soils (Falkinham et al., 2009). The actinomycete 
bacteria isolated from these soils produced actinomycin C2 and 
actinomycin C3, which are polypeptide antibiotics that bind to a 
pre-melted DNA conformation present within the transcriptional 
complex (Sobell, 1985) and, as such, have very little chance to be 
preserved in ancient samples.
Another possibility of exposure to antimicrobials in the pre-
antibiotic era could be through the remedies used for millennia 
in traditional/alternative medicine, in particular in traditional 
Chinese medicine (TCM). The best-known example is the discov-
ery of a potent anti-malarial drug, qinghaosu (artemisinin), which 
was extracted in the 1970s from Artemisia plants, used by Chinese 
herbalists for thousands of years as a remedy for many illnesses (Cui 
and Su, 2009). Antimicrobial activity seems present in a number of 
other herbs used in TCM (Wong et al., 2010) and the discovery of 
active components in these ancient remedies may enrich the arsenal 
of antimicrobials used by the mainstream medicine. At the same 
time, selective pressures imposed by these antimicrobial activities 
during the long-term history of TCM may have been one of the 
factors contributing to the accumulation of antibiotic resistance 
genes in human populations.
The natural history of antibiotic resistance genes can be revealed 
through the phylogenetic reconstruction and this kind of analysis 
suggests the long-term presence of genes conferring resistance to 
several classes of antibiotics in nature well before the antibiotic era 
(Aminov and Mackie, 2007; Kobayashi et al., 2007). Structure-based 
phylogeny of serine and metallo-β-lactamases, for example, estab-
lished that these ancient enzymes originated more than two billion 
years ago, with some serine β-lactamases being present on plasmids 
for millions of years (Hall and Barlow, 2004; Garau et al., 2005). 
Phylogeny of the β-lactamase and housekeeping genes is highly 
congruent in Klebsiella oxytoca implying that these genes have been 
evolving for over 100 million years in this host (Fevre et al., 2005). 
Antibiotics and antibiotic resistance in the 
pre‑antibiotic era
Antimicrobials are probably one of the most successful forms of 
chemotherapy in the history of medicine. It is not necessary to 
reiterate here how many lives they have saved and how significantly 
they have contributed to the control of infectious diseases that were 
the leading causes of human morbidity and mortality for most of 
human existence. Contrary to the common belief that the exposure 
to antibiotics is confined to the modern “antibiotic era,” research 
has revealed that this is not the case. The traces of tetracycline, for 
example, have been found in human skeletal remains from ancient 
Sudanese Nubia dating back to 350–550 CE (Bassett et al., 1980; 
Nelson et al., 2010). The distribution of tetracycline in bones is 
only explicable after exposure to tetracycline-containing materi-
als in the diet of these ancient people. Another example of ancient 
antibiotic exposure is from a histological study of samples taken 
from the femoral midshafts of the late Roman period skeletons 
from the Dakhleh Oasis, Egypt (Cook et al., 1989). These samples 
showed discrete fluorochrome labeling consistent with the pres-
ence of tetracycline in the diet at that time (Cook et al., 1989). The 
postulated intake of tetracycline in these populations possibly had a 
protective effect because the rate of infectious diseases documented 
in the Sudanese Nubian population was low, and no traces of bone 
infection were detected in the samples from the Dakhleh Oasis 
(Armelagos, 1969; Cook et al., 1989).
Tetracyclines are unique among antibiotics in that they are 
strong chelators and are incorporated into the hydroxyapatite min-
eral portion of bones as well as tooth enamel and thus provide 
permanent markers of metabolically active areas during tetracy-
cline exposure. Traces of exposure to other antibiotics in ancient 
populations are much more difficult to detect, and only surviving 
customs and anecdotal evidence may point to these occurrences. 
For example, anecdotes about the antibiotic-like properties of red 
soils in Jordan that were used historically (and are still being used 
as an inexpensive alternative to pharmaceutical products today)

1 integrons. Moreover, once the sulfa drug resistance is established 
on a mobile genetic element, it may be difficult to eliminate because 
the resulting construct confers a fitness advantage to the host even 
in the absence of antibiotic selection (Enne et al., 2004). Despite 
this, many continuously modified derivatives of this oldest class of 
synthetic antibiotics are still a viable option for therapy, and the 
action of and resistance to sulfanilamide is one of the best examples 
for the arms race between man and microbes. Two other classes 
of synthetic antibiotics successful in clinical use are the quinolo­
nes, such as ciprofloxacin, and oxazolidinones, such as linezoild 
(Walsh, 2003).
Probably many of us are familiar with the somewhat seren­
dipitous event on the September 3, 1928 that led to the penicillin 
discovery by Fleming (1929). Although the antibacterial proper­
ties of mold had been known from ancient times, and researchers 
before him had come upon the similar observations regarding the 
antimicrobial activity of Penicillium from time to time2, it was his 
formidable persistency and his belief in the idea that made the 
difference. For 12 years after his initial observation, A. Fleming 
was trying to get chemists interested in resolving persisting prob­
lems with purification and stability of the active substance and 
supplied the Penicillium strain to anyone requesting it. He finally 
abandoned the idea in 1940, but, fortunately, in the same year an 
Oxford team led by Howard Florey and Ernest Chain published a 
paper describing the purification of penicillin quantities sufficient 
for clinical testing (Chain et al., 2005). Their protocol eventu­
ally led to penicillin mass production and distribution in 1945. 
Fleming’s screening method using inhibition zones in lawns of 
pathogenic bacteria on the surface of agar-medium plates required 
much less resources than any testing in animal disease models 
and thus became widely used in mass screenings for antibiotic-
producing microorganisms by many researchers in academia and 
industry. Fleming was also among the first who cautioned about 
the potential resistance to penicillin if used too little or for a too 
short period during treatment.
Unknown to many, however, is the fact that the first hospital 
use of a drug that we would name an antibiotic today was the so-
called Pyocyanase prepared by Emmerich and Löw (1899) from 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (formerly Bacillus pycyaneus). Importantly, 
Emmerich and Löw noticed that the bacterium as well as the prepared 
extracts were active against a number of pathogenic bacteria and 
thus tried to use the extract for treatment of various diseases. As the 
results of these treatments were not consistent and the preparation 
itself was quite toxic for humans, the treatment was eventually aban­
doned. Further investigations confirmed the production of antibi­
otic substances by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Hays et al., 1945), which 
appeared to be the quorum sensing molecules, 2-alkyl-4‑quinolones, 
in this bacterium (Dubern and Diggle, 2008). Another quorum sens­
ing molecule of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, N-(3-oxododecanoyl) 
homoserine lactone, and its non-­enzymatically formed product, 
3-(1-hydroxydecylidene)-5-(2-­hydroxyethyl)pyrrolidine-2,4-dione, 
also display potent antibacterial activities (Kaufmann et al., 2005).
The discovery of these first three antimicrobials, Salvarsan, 
Prontosil, and penicillin, was exemplary, as those studies set up the 
paradigms for future drug discovery research. The paths, ­followed 
The similar phylogenetic analysis of β-lactamases in the metage­
nomic clones derived from the 10,000 years old “cold-seep” sedi­
ments indicated that most of the diversity of these enzymes is not 
the result of recent evolution, but is that of ancient evolution (Song 
et al., 2005).
Foundation of the antibiotic era
We usually associate the beginning of the modern “antibiotic era” 
with the names of Paul Ehrlich and Alexander Fleming. Ehrlich’s 
idea of a “magic bullet” that selectively targets only disease-causing 
microbes and not the host was based on an observation that aniline 
and other synthetic dyes, which first became available at that time, 
could stain specific microbes but not others. Ehrlich argued that 
chemical compounds could be synthesized that would “be able to 
exert their full action exclusively on the parasite harbored within 
the organism1.” This idea led him to begin a large-scale and sys­
tematic screening program (as we would call it today) in 1904 to 
find a drug against syphilis, a disease that was endemic and almost 
incurable at that time. This sexually transmitted disease, caused 
by the spirochete Treponema pallidium, was usually treated with 
inorganic mercury salts but the treatment had severe side effects 
and poor efficacy. In his laboratory, together with chemist Alfred 
Bertheim and bacteriologist Sahachiro Hata, they synthesized hun­
dreds of organoarsenic derivatives of a highly toxic drug Atoxyl 
and tested them in syphilis-infected rabbits. In 1909 they came 
across the sixth compound in the 600th series tested, thus numbered 
606, which cured syphilis-infected rabbits and showed significant 
promise for the treatment of patients with this venereal disease 
in limited trials on humans (Ehrlich and Hata, 1910). Despite the 
tedious injection procedure and side effects, the drug, marketed 
by Hoechst under the name Salvarsan, was a great success and, 
together with a more soluble and less toxic Neosalvarsan, enjoyed 
the status of the most frequently prescribed drug until its replace­
ment by penicillin in the 1940s (Mahoney et al., 1943). Amazingly, 
the mode of action of this 100-year-old drug is still unknown, and 
the controversy about its chemical structure has been solved only 
recently (Lloyd et al., 2005).
The systematic screening approach introduced by Paul Ehrlich 
became the cornerstone of drug search strategies in the pharma­
ceutical industry and resulted in thousands of drugs identified 
and translated into clinical practice, including, of course, a vari­
ety of antimicrobial drugs. During the earlier days of antibiotics 
research, this approach led to the discovery of sulfa drugs, namely 
sulfonamidochrysoidine (KI-730, Prontosil), which was synthe­
sized by Bayer chemists Josef Klarer and Fritz Mietzsch and tested by 
Gerhard Domagk for antibacterial activity in a number of diseases 
(Domagk, 1935). Prontosil, however, appeared to be a precursor 
to the active drug, and the active part of it, sulfanilamide, was thus 
not patentable as it had already been in use in the dye industry for 
some years. As sulfanilamide was cheap to produce and off-patent, 
and the sulfanilamide moiety was easy to modify, many companies 
subsequently started mass production of sulfonamide derivatives. 
The legacy of this oldest antibiotic on market is possibly reflected 
in one of the most broadly disseminated cases of drug resistance: 
sulfa drug resistance, which is almost universally linked with class

Lessons and challenges of antibiotic era
by other researchers, resulted in a number of new antibiotics, some 
of which made their way up to the patient’s bedside. The period 
between the 1950s and 1970s was indeed the golden era of discovery 
of novel antibiotics classes, with no new classes discovered since then. 
Therefore, with the decline of the discovery rate, the mainstream 
approach for the development of new drugs to combat emerging 
and re-emerging resistance of pathogens to antibiotics has been the 
modification of existing antibiotics (Chopra et al., 2002).
Antibiotic resistance
Even before the extensive use of penicillin, some observations 
suggested that bacteria could destroy it by enzymatic degrada­
tion (Abraham and Chain, 1940). In general, though, the outlook 
was more or less optimistic. One of the earlier studies of possi­
ble resistance emergence under laboratory conditions concluded 
that: “Syphilis has now been treated with arsenicals for about 
40 years without any indications of an increased incidence of 
arsenic-­resistant infections, and this work gives grounds for hop­
ing that the widespread use of penicillin will equally not result 
in an increasing incidence of infections resistant to penicillin” 
(Rollo et al., 1952). Surprisingly, this is still true for T. pallidium 
(Cha et al., 2004), but not for many other pathogenic bacteria, 
including the Enterobacteriaceae, which have become resistant 
not only to the original penicillin but also to semi-synthetic peni­
cillins, cephalosporins, and newer carbapenems (Kumarasamy 
et al., 2010).
The mortality rates due to multidrug-resistant bacterial infec­
tions are high. Each year, about 25,000 patients in the EU die from 
an infection with the selected multidrug-resistant bacteria (ECDC/
EMEA Joint Working Group, 2009), and more than 63,000 patients 
in the United States die every year from hospital-acquired bac­
terial infections3. Estimated economic costs due to infections by 
multidrug-resistant bacteria in the EU result in extra healthcare 
costs and productivity losses of at least EUR 1.5 billion each year 
(ECDC/EMEA Joint Working Group, 2009). The annual additional 
cost of treating hospital-acquired infections from just six species 
of antibiotic-resistant bacteria was estimated to be at least $1.3 
billion in 1992 dollars ($1.87 billion in 2006 dollars) – more than 
the annual spending on influenza3.
There are a number of excellent reviews elsewhere describing a 
variety of antibiotic resistance mechanisms and, within the frames 
of the bullet-target concept, these mechanisms can be classified as 
a target or bullet-related. Targets can be: (i) protected by modifica­
tion (mutations making it insensitive to antibiotic action such as 
mutations in RNA polymerase conferring resistant to rifampin; (ii) 
modified by an enzyme (such as methylation of an adenine residue 
in 23S rRNA making it insensitive to macrolides); (iii) replaced 
(for example, ribosomal protection proteins conferring resistance 
to tetracyclines); and (iv) protected at cellular or population levels 
(formation of a protective barrier by secretion, for example, of large 
amounts of exopolysaccharides). The bullet can be: (i) modified 
so the efficiency is lost, as in the case of acetylation of aminogly­
cosides, (ii) destroyed (as the β-lactam antibiotics by the action 
of β-lactamases), and (iii) pumped out from the cell as in efflux 
pump mechanisms of resistance.
Recent works in the area of antimicrobials and resistance suggest 
that not all interactions of bacteria with antibiotics can be explained 
within the frames of the classical bullet-target concept. For example, 
a recent work on novel antibiotic resistance mechanism used the 
“kin selection” concept, since this resistance ­mechanism operates at 
the population/system level (Lee et al., 2010). This well-established 
theory for the macro-organismal world seems also applicable to the 
microbial world, where a small number of antibiotic-resistant bacte­
ria provide protection for the antibiotic sensitive cells, thus ensuring 
the survival of the whole population under the antibiotic assault. 
Moreover, in complex biofilm consortia, the protection against 
antibiotics is offered to all community members, irrespectively of 
the kinship, which requires a conceptual framework operating at 
the system level. Thus the conceptual base of microbe–antibiotic 
interaction has been broadening beyond the bullet-target model 
to reflect the complexity of these interactions (Davies et al., 2006; 
Fajardo and Martínez, 2008; Aminov, 2009; Lee et al., 2010).
Resistance problem complexity
The current state in the field of antimicrobials, resistance, and 
chemotherapy is certainly not limited to clinical microbiology as 
it was in the early years of the antibiotic era. Thus, it is not a single 
grand challenge; it is rather a complex problem requiring con­
certed efforts of microbiologists, ecologists, health care specialists, 
educationalists, policy makers, legislative bodies, agricultural and 
pharmaceutical industry workers, and the public to deal with. In 
fact, this should be of everyone’s concern, because, in the end, there 
is always a probability for any of us at some stage to get infected 
with a pathogen that is resistant to antibiotic treatment. Moreover, 
even the behavioral patterns, such as hygienic habits or compliance 
with antibiotic treatment regimens, may have consequences that are 
not limited only to individual health issues but, on a larger scale, 
contribute to the interaction with the resistomes around us. In 
the following sections I will briefly touch upon some of the areas 
ranging from research to regulations to the cultural patterns that 
are important in dealing with the challenges of the antimicrobials, 
resistance, and therapy fields.
Improvement of antimicrobials
This strategy of modification of the existing antimicrobials was 
initiated (and successfully implemented) during the period, when 
the rate of discovery of novel drug classes suddenly dropped in the 
1970s, and the growing resistance problem enforced researchers 
to look into the possible modification of the existing arsenal that 
could confer improved activity, less sensitivity toward resistance 
mechanisms, and less toxicity (Chopra et al., 2002). Although this 
approach still successfully provides effective antimicrobials for the 
market, one of the lessons learned during this arms race is that 
sooner or later bacteria will acquire resistance to these modified ver­
sions as well through the horizontal acquisition of novel resistance 
mechanisms or rapid molecular evolution of the existing resistances 
to older antibiotics.
Novel antimicrobials
The antibiotic treatment choices for already existing or emerging 
hard-to-treat multidrug-resistant bacterial infections are limited, 
resulting in high morbidity and mortality rates. Although there

Lessons and challenges of antibiotic era
Other potential targets for intervention in bacterial metabolism 
include fatty acid biosynthesis (Su and Honek, 2007), cell divi­
sion (Lock and Harry, 2008), biosynthesis of aminoacyl-tRNAs 
(Schimmel et al., 1998), quorum sensing (Njoroge and Sperandio, 
2009), bacterial two-component signal transduction (Gotoh et al., 
2010), and proton motive force (Diacon et al., 2009). Antibiotic resist­
ance mechanisms themselves such as efflux pumps or β-lactamases 
can also be targeted to restore the efficacy of antibiotics, which is 
compromised by the growing resistance problem (Lomovskaya and 
Bostian, 2006; Bush and Macielag, 2010). It should be noted that, 
moving along this route, we are cardinally departing from the previ­
ously defined classical structural divisions into antibiotic classes. We 
are only at the beginning here, and not many antibacterial drugs with 
novel mechanisms of action have entered clinical trials yet, but even 
at this stage the majority of them do not belong to the previously 
defined antibiotic classes (Devasahayam et al., 2010).
Also, the intervention strategies aimed not only at the targets but 
rather at biological networks may help to create new antibacterial 
therapies (Kohanski et al., 2010a). Combination therapy coupling 
antibiotics with an antibiotic-enhancing phage, for example, has 
demonstrated the potential to be a promising antimicrobial inter­
vention (Lu and Collins, 2009).
Prevention of antibiotic resistance
The main problem we are facing with antibiotic therapy is that after a 
new antibiotic is introduced, resistance to it will, sooner or later, arise. 
This scenario has been seen on multiple occasions, and thus there is a 
continuing race between the discovery and development of new antibi­
otics and the bacteria that will respond to this selective pressure by the 
emergence of resistance mechanisms. So how to protect the power of 
antibiotics and extend their lifespan? There are many factors contribut­
ing to the emergence and dissemination of antibiotic resistance and, as 
mentioned before, the problems require a complex approach.
A significant factor to consider apparently is the use of antibiotics 
by humans. Not surprisingly, the level of antibiotic-resistant infec­
tions strongly correlates with the level of antibiotic consumption 
(Goossens et al., 2005). There may be requests from patients to 
prescribe antibiotics when there is no need for them, as in the case of 
viral infections, and which should be explained to them. Indeed, the 
lack of knowledge about antibiotic resistance positively correlates 
with the higher prevalence of resistance (Grigoryan et al., 2007). The 
important part is also to comply with the drug use regimen, which 
may be difficult in the case of infections requiring long-term therapy 
with multiple antibiotics as in the case of TB. The contributing fac­
tor to the dissemination of antibiotic resistance, even in the case of 
absolute compliance, may be the practice of empirical prescription 
of antibiotics (which accounts for the vast majority of prescriptions). 
The development of express ABR profiling tests would be quite help­
ful in the initiation of the most efficient therapy available, avoiding 
the hurdles associated with a resistant pathogen. In therapy, the use 
of a recombinant β-lactamase during intravenous administration of 
ampicillin may prevent the emergence of antimicrobial resistance 
in gut microbiota (Tarkkanen et al., 2009).
The situation is different in countries where the sales of antibiot­
ics are inadequately regulated, and antibiotics are available without 
prescription. In the absence of regulation, the personal decisions on 
antibiotic purchase and use are governed by cultural and economic 
are some potential alternatives to antibiotic treatment such as pas­
sive immunization (Keller and Stiehm, 2000) or phage therapy 
(Levin and Bull, 2004; Monk et al., 2010), the mainstream approach 
relies on the discovery and development of newer, more efficient 
antibiotics. The vast majority of antimicrobial classes in use today 
have been isolated in the golden era of antibiotic discovery from a 
limited number of ecological niches and taxonomic groups, mainly 
from soil Actinomyces. Further exploration of this ecological niche, 
coupled with newer technologies such as cell-free assays and high-
throughput screening, however, did not produce any novel drug 
classes in the past 20+ years. What approaches could be taken to 
uncover the novel antimicrobials diversity that is potentially suit­
able for therapeutic applications?
Some possible approaches to tap the novel antimicrobial diver­
sity is the exploration of ecological niches other than soil, such 
as the marine environment (Hughes and Fenical, 2010; Rahman 
et al., 2010), borrowing antimicrobial peptides and compounds 
from animals and plants (Hancock and Sahl, 2006), mimicking 
the natural lipopeptides of bacteria and fungi (Makovitzki et al., 
2006), accessing the uncultivated portion of microbiota through 
the metagenomic approach (MacNeil et al., 2001), and, finally, the 
use of the complete synthetic route pioneered during the early years 
of the antibiotic era. The latter approach becomes dominant in the 
search for drugs aimed at the newly identified targets in a bacterial 
cell. Other strategies may include drugs engineered to possess dual 
target activities, such as a rifamycin–quinolone hybrid antibiotic, 
CBR-2092 (Robertson et al., 2008).
New targets for antimicrobials
The vast majority of current antibiotics, even heavily modified, 
target the same cellular processes as their natural or synthetic 
predecessors. The range of these targets is limited to the compo­
nents of translational machinery, cell wall biosynthesis, DNA/
RNA metabolism and some other cellular processes. With the 
extensive range of genomes sequenced, it becomes possible to 
implement the idea of a magic bullet in a more elaborate way, with 
essential targets defined much more precisely at the molecular 
level. This needs to be complemented by the availability of chemi­
cally diverse compound collections to screen for the target/drug 
combination (Payne et al., 2007). The comparison of metabolic 
pathways in commensal and pathogenic bacteria and drugs tar­
geting the pathogenic traits may help to identify the novel drug/
target combinations in pathogens and thus the novel paradigm of 
antimicrobial therapy as targeting virulence (Clatworthy, 2007). 
Successful implementations of this approach have already been 
demonstrated in the suppression of an important virulence fac­
tor, type III secretion system (Negrea et al., 2007), and in the 
inhibition of the QseC-mediated activation of virulence gene 
expression in several pathogens (Rasko et al., 2008). The drugs 
initially designed for a different purpose may find application as 
antimicrobials. For example, BPH-652, a phosphonosulfonate, 
which was previously tested for cholesterol-lowering activity in 
humans as targeting the enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis path­
way, squalene synthase, is also inhibiting an important enzyme 
involved in Staphylococcus aureus virulence, dehydrosqualene syn­
thase, and thus may be considered as a candidate drug to control 
MRSA (Liu et al., 2008).

Lessons and challenges of antibiotic era
in DNA metabolism in environmental bacteria also happened to 
be protecting against this synthetic antibiotic, and, once the encod­
ing gene entered into the human/animal microbiota on a mobile 
element, a strong selective pressure led to its amplification and 
dissemination into the commensal and pathogenic microbiota 
(Aminov and Mackie, 2007).
Another important aspect is the release of antibiotics and the 
corresponding pre-selected and amplified antibiotic resistance gene 
pool from the human and animal ecological compartments back into 
the environment (Chee-Sanford et al., 2009). What are the conse­
quences of this? Does the resulting multidrug combination in the 
environment accelerate the evolution toward antimicrobial resistance 
(Hegreness et al., 2008)? What are the consequences of the presence 
of sublethal concentration antibiotics in the environment (Kohanski 
et al., 2010b)? What is the impact of the environmental stresses, such 
as, for example, the SOS response-inducing UV radiation, on the 
horizontal dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (Beaber et al., 
2004)? What is the rate of decay of the released antibiotic resistance 
genes in the environment, given the improved survival strategies of 
mobile genetic elements (de la Cueva-Méndez and Pimentel, 2007)? 
Could the environment provide a broader playground for the mobile 
antibiotic resistance encoding elements to promote their own diver­
sity (Garriss et al., 2009)? And what are the chances for antibiotic 
resistance genes to re-enter the human and animal food chain? There 
are pressing needs to answer these questions to build the broader 
strategies that would help to preserve the power of antibiotics.
Conclusions
Albeit very brief, both on the global evolutionary and human his­
tory scales, the antibiotics era went through many ups and downs, 
providing us valuable lessons on many aspects of how the microbial 
world around us functions. The discovery and use of antibiotics, anti­
biotic resistance markers, and mobile elements such plasmids were 
at the foundation of genetic engineering and molecular biology that 
eventually resulted in spectacular successes of the human genome 
and other sequencing projects. These tools were also indispensable 
for shaping modern biotechnology ranging from the production of 
recombinant proteins to construction of entire metabolic pathways. 
Microorganisms, however, use the very same (and probably some 
additional but still unidentified) natural mechanisms to protect them­
selves against the massive antibiotic assaults continuously launched by 
the humankind from the time of discovery of antibiotics. Although 
the majority of infections were placed under control, this equilibrium 
in the arm race is fragile, since during the almost four billion years of 
evolution the microbial world has accumulated an enormous diversity 
of metabolic and protective mechanisms than can be mobilized in 
response to a strong selection. We need to learn to be more precise 
in targeting the pathogens and limit the indiscriminate use of anti­
microbials and other practices that accelerate the emergence of novel 
resistance mechanisms. Investigation of the microbial world around 
us for potential mechanisms of antibiotic resistance and dissemina­
tion may help to design the early warning and preventive measures 
to sustain the efficacy of antimicrobials and chemotherapy.

reasons (Gartin et  al., 2010). Self-medication certainly lacks the 
attributes of a successful therapy, such as proper diagnosis, suitable 
antibiotic choice, correct usage, compliance, and treatment efficiency 
monitoring, thus contributing to the mounting resistance problem.
Domesticated animals also get infected and require antibiotic 
therapy. The agricultural use of antibiotics, however, is not limited 
exclusively to this use. Antibiotics are also used for the growth 
promotional and prophylactic purposes in food animals, as well 
as for a broader and less-targeted treatment in aquaculture and 
horticulture. The experience of the Scandinavian countries, where 
the programs of optimal disease preventive management routines 
and proper use of antimicrobials, combined with the withdrawal 
of antibiotic growth promoters, were implemented in food animal 
production, is encouraging. These measures resulted in reduction 
in the use of antimicrobials and prevented the creation of a rela­
tively favorable situation for antimicrobial resistance (Bengtsson 
and Wierup, 2006). With the ban of growth promoting antibiot­
ics in 2006, other EU countries have been implementing similar 
measures to limit the occurrence and dissemination of antibiotic 
resistance from agricultural sources.
Environmental resistome
The history of massive production and use of antibiotics by humans 
is very short on the evolutionary scale, but even this short-term 
(albeit large-scale) practice has produced very interesting results 
demonstrating the interminable adaptive capabilities of bacteria, 
which allow them to withstand massive antibiotic insults and gen­
erate some formidable examples of hard-to-treat infections that 
we call “superbugs.” Although no broad baseline data collection 
on antibiotic resistance genes has been performed at the onset of 
antibiotic use, recent studies suggest that the most likely source of 
these genes is the environmental antibiotic resistome (Martínez, 
2008; Wright, 2010). The functional role of antimicrobials and the 
corresponding resistance genes in natural ecosystems is hypoth­
esized as a signaling/regulatory rather than a bullet/target rela­
tionship (Davies et al., 2006; Fajardo and Martínez, 2008; Aminov, 
2009). Confirmatory to this suggestion are also the other thera­
peutic properties of antimicrobials, well beyond the initial range 
of use as anti-infective agents (Griffin et al., 2010). Bacteria do not 
respect the boundaries of ecological compartments, and there is 
always a continuous flow by genetic information between different 
ecological compartments. Once the potential antibiotic resistance 
genes enter, even in small numbers or low frequencies, into the 
commensal/pathogenic human/animal microbiota, the antibiotic 
selection immediately leads to the amplification and dissemination 
of these genes. Indeed, there is some evidence on the environmental 
origin of some clinically relevant resistance genes (Wright, 2010).
The predecessor/ancestral genes for antibiotic resistance are not 
necessarily the genes conferring resistance per se in natural ecosys­
tems. The recently emerged resistance to synthetic antibiotics of the 
quinolone class is mediated by the qnr genes that have been acquired 
from aquatic bacteria (Poirel et al., 2005). It was suggested that the 
original function of one of its homologs, MfpA, is providing DNA 
topological assistance when needed, and maintaining a condensed 
chromosome and preventing undesired topological changes dur­
ing periods of replicative senescence (Hegde et al., 2005). In this 
scenario of quinolone resistance emergence, the enzyme involved
