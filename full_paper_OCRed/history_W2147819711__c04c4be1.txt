In this work we investigated the antibacterial properties of differently shaped silver nanoparticles against the
gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli, both in liquid systems and on agar plates. Energy-ﬁltering trans-
mission electron microscopy images revealed considerable changes in the cell membranes upon treatment,
resulting in cell death. Truncated triangular silver nanoplates with a {111} lattice plane as the basal plane
displayed the strongest biocidal action, compared with spherical and rod-shaped nanoparticles and with Ag
(in the form of AgNO3). It is proposed that nanoscale size and the presence of a {111} plane combine to
promote this biocidal property. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst comparative study on the bactericidal
properties of silver nanoparticles of different shapes, and our results demonstrate that silver nanoparticles
undergo a shape-dependent interaction with the gram-negative organism E. coli.
Over the past few decades, inorganic nanoparticles, whose
structures exhibit signiﬁcantly novel and improved physical,
chemical, and biological properties, phenomena, and function-
ality due to their nanoscale size, have elicited much interest.
Nanophasic and nanostructured materials are attracting a
great deal of attention because of their potential for achieving
speciﬁc processes and selectivity, especially in biological and
pharmaceutical applications (5, 39).
Discoveries in the past decade have demonstrated that the
electromagnetic, optical, and catalytic properties of noble-metal
nanocrystals are strongly inﬂuenced by shape and size (6, 26).
This has motivated an upsurge in research on the synthesis routes
that allow better control of shape and size (18, 34, 41), with
projected applications in nanoelectronics and spectroscopy (14,
19, 36).
Recent studies have demonstrated that specially formulated
metal oxide nanoparticles have good antibacterial activity (33),
and antimicrobial formulations comprising nanoparticles could
be effective bactericidal materials (11, 12).
Among inorganic antibacterial agents, silver has been em-
ployed most extensively since ancient times to ﬁght infections
and control spoilage. The antibacterial and antiviral actions of
silver, silver ion, and silver compounds have been thoroughly
investigated (28, 29, 37). However, in minute concentrations,
silver is nontoxic to human cells. The epidemiological history
of silver has established its nontoxicity in normal use. Catalytic
oxidation by metallic silver and reaction with dissolved mono-
valent silver ion probably contribute to its bactericidal effect
(17). Microbes are unlikely to develop resistance against silver,
as they do against conventional and narrow-target antibiotics,
because the metal attacks a broad range of targets in the
organisms, which means that they would have to develop a host
of mutations simultaneously to protect themselves. Thus, silver
ions have been used as an antibacterial component in dental
resin composites (15), in synthetic zeolites (22), and in coatings
of medical devices (2).
Recent literature reports encouraging results about the bac-
tericidal activity of silver nanoparticles of either a simple or
composite nature (21, 31). Elechiguerra and coworkers (9)
found that silver nanoparticles undergo a size-dependent in-
teraction with human immunodeﬁciency virus type 1, prefera-
bly via binding to gp120 glycoprotein knobs. The size-depen-
dent interaction of silver nanoparticles with gram-negative
bacteria has also been reported by the same group (25). How-
ever, little is known about how the biological activity of silver
nanoparticles changes as the shape of the particles changes.
For these reason, we investigated the shape dependence of
the antibacterial activity of silver nanoparticles against Esche-
richia coli. Silver nanoparticles of different shapes were syn-
thesized by solution phase routes, and their interactions with
E. coli were studied. Energy-ﬁltering transmission electron mi-
croscopy (EFTEM) was used as a complementary technique to
examine the treated cells. The size-dependent antimicrobial
activity of silver nanoparticles has already been investigated (9,
25), while to our knowledge the effect of shape on the anti-
bacterial activity of silver nanoparticles has not been reported
previously.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials. E. coli (ATCC 10536) was obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Difco nutrient broth (NB) (BD234000) and
Difco nutrient agar (BD 213000) medium (Becton Dickinson and Co.) were used
to grow and maintain the bacterial cultures per the supplier’s protocol. Chemi-
cals such as silver nitrate, ascorbic acid, sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate, and
cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) were of the highest purity available
(Sigma). These reagents were used as received without further puriﬁcation.
Preparation of silver nanoparticles. The silver nanoparticles used in this work
were synthesized by two different methods. Both include seeding and growth.
First, silver seeds were prepared by rapidly injecting 0.5 ml of 10 mM NaBH4
into an aqueous solution (with continuous stirring) containing 0.5 ml of 0.01 M

AgNO3 and 20 ml of 0.001 M sodium citrate. The resultant solution was stirred
for 5 min and aged for 1.5 h.
In the ﬁrst method, the spherical silver hydrosols were prepared by reducing
aqueous AgNO3 with sodium citrate at near-boiling temperature. In a typical
procedure, an aqueous solution of AgNO3 (100 ml, 0.001 M) was brought to
boiling, and then 3 ml of the silver seed solution and an aqueous solution of
sodium citrate were added so that the ﬁnal concentration of sodium citrate in the
reaction mixture became 0.001 M. The solution was heated until the color was
greenish yellow. The solution was cooled to room temperature. The silver nano-
particles were puriﬁed by centrifugation. To remove excess silver ions, the silver
pellet was washed three times with deionized water. A dried powder of the
nanosize silver was obtained by freeze-drying. To carry out interaction of the
silver nanoparticles with bacteria, the silver nanoparticle powder in the freeze-
drying cuvette was resuspended in water; the suspension was homogenized with
a Branson 2200 ultrasonicator. The resulting silver concentration was measured
by either inductively coupled plasma (ICP) emission spectroscopy (ES) (ICPS-
1000IV; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) or ICP mass spectrometry (MS) (ELAN 6100;
Perkin-Elmer SCIEX).
Elongated (rod-shaped) and truncated triangular silver nanoplates were syn-
thesized by a solution phase method for the large-scale preparation of truncated
triangular nanoplates (8). To the particle growth solution containing 5 ml of 0.01
M AgNO3, 10 ml of 0.1 M ascorbic acid, 146 ml of 0.1 M CTAB, and 5 ml of silver
seeds, 1 ml of 1 M NaOH was added to accelerate particle growth. The solution
color changed from light yellow to brown, red, and green within a few minutes.
The resultant solution was aged at 21°C for 12 h, 35°C for 5 min, and 21°C for
24 h. The color of the aged solution changed from green to red.
The silver nanoplates were puriﬁed by centrifugation. The surfactants and the
smaller particles were separated by centrifugation at 2,100  g for 10 min. The
resultant precipitate was suspended in water and centrifuged again at 755  g for
10 min. Finally, the precipitate was suspended in water, and rods with larger
aspect ratios were removed by centrifuging at 84  g for 10 min. The supernatant
solution contained the truncated triangular silver nanoplates. It was not possible
to quantify the precipitate by weight, as it was always associated with some
water. The resulting silver level was quantiﬁed by ICP-ES or ICP-MS analysis
and reported in milligrams per liter or parts per million (detection limit of
Ag, 0.1 ppb).
Organism preparation. E. coli ATCC 10536 was grown overnight in NB at
37°C. Washed cells were resuspended in NB, and optical density (OD) was
adjusted to 0.1, corresponding to 108 CFU/ml at 600 nm.
Bacterial growth or killing kinetics in presence of nanosilver. To examine the
bacterial growth or killing kinetics in the presence of silver nanoparticles, E. coli
cells were grown in 100 ml of NB supplemented with different doses of nanosilver
(total silver content, 1, 6, 12, 12.5, 50, or 100 g), at 37°C with continuous
agitation. The cylindrical sample containers were placed horizontally on an
orbital shaker platform and agitated at 225 rpm. Growth or killing rates and
bacterial concentrations were determined by measuring OD at 600 nm. The OD
values were converted into concentration of E. coli cells (CFU per milliliter) (21,
31). OriginPro 7.5 software was used to analyze the experimental data and for
graphing (see Fig. 1 and 3 to 7).
Bacterial susceptibility to nanosilver. To examine the susceptibility of E. coli
to different silver nanoparticles, nutrient agar plates from a solution of agar were
prepared. A 100-l sample of bacterial suspension cultured in NB (with a
concentration of 105 or 107 CFU/ml of E. coli) was plated on a nutrient agar
plate. The plates were then supplemented with different amounts of nanosize
silver particles (1 to 100 g), and the plates were incubated further at 37°C. The
numbers of resultant colonies were counted after 24 h of incubation. Silver-free
plates incubated under the same conditions were used as controls. The counts
from three independent experiments corresponding to a particular sample were
averaged.
EFTEM analysis was also carried out to examine sections of the treated
bacteria. Images of negatively stained particles were acquired as follows. Con-
centrated aqueous suspensions of E. coli cells were deposited on Formvar-coated
grids and allowed to sit for a few minutes. The grids were exposed to aqueous 1%
phosphotungstic acid for 30 s. The residual staining solution was then removed,
and the samples were immediately transferred to a microscope for inspection.
EFTEM images were acquired on a LIBRA 120 (Carl Zeiss) transmission elec-
tron microscope.
Characterization of silver nanoparticles. The synthesized nanoparticles were
characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy and EFTEM. EFTEM images were
observed with a LIBRA 120 (Carl Zeiss) transmission electron microscope. The
samples were prepared by placing a drop of homogeneous suspension on a
copper grid with a lacey carbon ﬁlm and allowing it to dry in air. Mean particle
size was analyzed from the digitized images with Image Tool software. UV-
visible absorption spectra were recorded with an Optizen 2120 UV-visible spec-
trophotometer (Mecasys, Daejeon, Korea) with a 1-cm quartz cell.
RESULTS
UV-visible spectroscopy is one of the most widely used tech-
niques for structural characterization of silver nanoparticles.
The absorption spectrum (Fig. 1a) of the pale yellow silver
colloids prepared by citrate reduction showed a surface plas-
mon absorption band with a maximum of 420 nm, indicating
the presence of lone spherical or roughly spherical Ag nano-
particles, and TEM imaging conﬁrmed this (Fig. 2A). A min-
imum at 320 nm corresponds to the wavelength at which the

real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function of silver
almost vanish (32).
The optical absorption spectra of metal nanoparticles are
dominated by surface plasmon resonances (SPR), which shift
to longer wavelengths with increasing particle size (4). The
position and shape of plasmon absorption of silver nanoclus-
ters are strongly dependent on the particle size, dielectric me-
dium, and surface-adsorbed species (20, 26). According to
Mie’s theory (24), only a single SPR band is expected in the
absorption spectra of spherical nanoparticles, whereas aniso-
tropic particles could give rise to two or more SPR bands
depending on the shape of the particles. The number of SPR
peaks increases as the symmetry of the nanoparticle decreases
(32). Thus, spherical nanoparticles, disks, and triangular nano-
plates of silver show one, two, and more peaks, respectively.
Even after several days, the aqueous dispersion of freeze-
dried Ag nanoparticles, prepared by citrate reduction, dis-
played UV-visible spectral characteristics of spherical Ag
nanoparticles (Fig. 1a), conﬁrming the colloidal stability and
uniformity of the silver hydrosol.
On the other hand, interesting optical signatures were ob-
served for the sample synthesized by the soft template method
in the presence of CTAB micelles. The solution showed a red
color; the corresponding absorption spectrum (Fig. 1b, “mix-
ture” curve) displays three peaks at 348, 420, and 485 and a
shoulder at 373 nm. The silver nanoparticles were separated by
centrifugation. The UV-visible spectra of all centrifuged sam-
ples are also shown in Fig. 1b (curves for washing 1 and wash-
ing 2). After centrifugation, the ﬁrst and second wash liquors
showed absorption maxima similar to that of the parent solu-
tion. A broad hump could be identiﬁed at a longer wavelength
(shifted to 509 nm for the second wash liquor), suggesting the
possible presence of a population of anisotropic Ag particles.
The UV-visible spectrum of the solution containing trun-
cated triangular silver nanoparticles (Fig. 1b, top inset) showed
two symmetrical absorption peaks at 418 and 514 nm. Also,
a few humps can be seen at shorter (348 and 373 nm) as well
as longer (562 and 643 nm) wavelengths. The calculation of
Schatz and Van Duyne (30) for the triangular prisms with the
discrete dipole approximation method suggests that the peaks
at longer wavelengths are due to the in-plane dipole (514, 562,
and 643 nm). The peak due to quadrupole plasmon resonance
(460 nm) was expected to be very weak (8) and could not be
seen. The shoulders at 373 and 348 nm are out-of-plane dipole
and quadrupole resonances, respectively. Formation of trian-
gular nanoplates is thus evident from the appearance of these
peaks. Chen and Carroll (8) also showed that the blue shift of
the in-plane dipole resonance to a lower wavelength (514 nm),
in contrast to the calculated resonance peak at 770 nm for a
perfect triangular nanoplate, indicates the truncated nature of
the triangular particles.
The UV-visible spectra of the solution containing the parti-
cles with larger aspect ratios (Fig. 1b, lower inset) showed
three main absorption peaks at 480, 517, and 575 nm along
with a few weak absorption peaks at the near-infrared (NIR)
region. The absorption in the NIR region may be due to the
in-plane dipole resonance mode associated with nanoplates
with edge lengths greater than 100 nm (35) and the strong
coupling between the nanoparticles arising from aggregation
of silver nanoparticles (16, 27). Absorption peaks for plates of
a given thickness at longer wavelengths are also suggested to
be associated with the larger lateral size of the plates (7).
EFTEM images (Fig. 2) revealed more signiﬁcant differ-
ences between these samples in terms of particle morphology.
While samples prepared by citrate reduction consisted mostly
of spherical nanoparticles (mean size of 39 nm) (Fig. 2A),
anisotropic Ag particles (truncated triangular plates, rods, and

polyhedral plates) were more easily identiﬁed in other samples
(Fig. 2B and C).
The presence of nanorods with an average edge length
above 100 nm was conﬁrmed by EFTEM. Figure 2B shows
rod-shaped nanoparticles with mean edge lengths of 133 nm
and mean diameters of 16 nm. In Fig. 2C, rod-shaped nano-
particles with larger aspect ratios, with a mean edge length of
192 nm and a mean diameter remaining at 16 nm, can be
seen.
Structural information on the truncated triangular nano-
plates was obtained by oriented particulate monolayer X-ray
diffraction (OPML-XRD). Figure 3 shows the XRD patterns
of the nanoplates lying ﬂat with their basal planes parallel to
the substrate. The remarkably intensive diffraction peak at a 2
value of 38.04 from the {111} lattice plane of face-centered
cubic silver unequivocally indicates that the particles are made
of pure silver and that their basal plane, i.e., the top crystal
plane, should be the {111} plane (8). It has been suggested (8)

that this plane may possess the lowest surface tension. Figure
3 (inset) shows the TEM image of puriﬁed truncated triangular
particles with an average edge length of 40 nm.
Figure 4A shows plates to which a 100-l bacterial suspen-
sion (approximately 107 CFU/ml) was applied. The presence of
nanoparticles at a certain level inhibited bacterial growth by
more than 90%. Interestingly, however, this level is signiﬁ-
cantly different for different nanoparticle shapes. For trun-
cated triangular particles, almost complete inhibition of bac-
terial growth was observed even at a total silver content of 1
g. In the case of spherical nanoparticles, a total silver content
above 12.5 g reduced the number of colonies signiﬁcantly,
while a total of 50 to 100 g of silver caused 100% inhibition
of bacterial growth. Rod-shaped nanoparticles and AgNO3
showed inferior performance. Even in the presence of 100 g
of rod-shaped particles, some colonies grew on the plate,
though fewer than with an identical AgNO3 dose.
Figure 4B shows the corresponding results, expressed as
log(1  x)  f(c), i.e., log(1  x) as a function of the total
amount of silver nanoparticles (c), where x was the number of
CFU grown on agar plates. The decrease in number of viable
cells with increasing amounts of silver can be ﬁtted with a
ﬁrst-order exponential decay curve with a nonlinear regression
coefﬁcient (R2) ranging from 0.96 to 1.
Figure 5 displays the number of bacterial colonies grown in
the presence of different amount of AgNO3 and spherical
nanoparticles when 100 l (approximately 105 CFU/ml) of
sample was applied to each plate. The results clearly indicate
that at a given concentration of silver, inhibition of bacterial
growth depends on the initial number of cells. An amount of 6
g of spherical nanoparticles almost completely prevented
bacterial growth (Fig. 5B). At silver (in the form of AgNO3)
amounts of 12.5 g and above, 100% inhibition of bacterial
growth was also observed (Fig. 5A). This is markedly different
from the results obtained when the initial number of bacterial
cells was 107 CFU. In this case also, the results, expressed as
log (1  x)  f(c), follow the ﬁrst-order exponential decay
curve with a nonlinear regression coefﬁcient (R2) of 0.99
(Fig. 5).
The bacterial growth kinetics was monitored in 100 ml NB
medium (initial bacterial concentration, 107 CFU/ml) supple-
mented with different amounts of different silver nanoparticles.
Figure 6 clearly shows that at all amounts, the nanoparticles
caused a growth delay of E. coli; increasing the concentration

of nanoparticles increased this growth delay. This is in line with
ﬁndings reported previously (31). A trend similar to that seen
in the plate study can be noticed in the broth study. At a given
concentration, truncated triangular nanoparticles are found to
be more effective in delaying the growth of E. coli than spher-
ical particles, which again demonstrated better antibacterial
activity than AgNO3. A dose of 10 g of truncated triangular
particles completely inhibited growth even after 24 h (Fig. 6C),
whereas 100 g of silver (in the form of AgNO3) and spherical
nanoparticles caused only a prolonged growth delay, 8 to
10 h (Fig. 6A and B).
As expected, bacterial growth was found to be dependent on
the initial number of cells present in the broth. Figure 6D
depicts the result of bacterial growth monitored in 100 ml of
NB (initial cell numbers, 105 CFU/ml) supplemented with dif-
ferent doses of spherical silver nanoparticles. A comparison
with Fig. 6B shows that spherical nanoparticles exhibited sig-
niﬁcantly superior antibacterial property at a given nanopar-
ticle dose when the initial E. coli concentration was reduced. A
similar trend was observed for other nanoparticles as well
(data not shown).
Figure 7a depicts the killing activity for E. coli (in 100 ml of
NB supplemented with 107 CFU/ml of cells) in the presence of
the mother liquor (the reaction mixture of triangular, rod-
shaped, and polyhedral silver nanoparticles, before centrifuga-
tion), containing different amounts of total silver (Ag and Ag
nanoparticles) as well as a substantial amount of CTAB. The
killing activity was found to be sustained, as no cell growth was
seen even after 26 h of incubation. Figure 7b shows the com-
parative killing activities for E. coli when the bacterial suspen-
sion was treated with the same mother liquor containing 12 g
of total silver immediately after preparation (see experimental
section) and after 1 and 2 weeks of aging at room temperature.
The killing activity of the silver hydrosol was found to diminish
with increased aging time. The Fig. 7b inset shows the dynam-
ics of E. coli growth as observed in the presence of 12 g of
different silver nanoparticles (10 g of truncated triangular
nanoparticles) and ionic silver (AgNO3) in 100 ml of NB sup-
plemented with 107 CFU/ml. Interestingly, instead of a growth
curve (Fig. 7b, inset), as seen in the presence of puriﬁed silver
nanoparticles, a decay curve was obtained when the E. coli
suspension was treated with the unpuriﬁed mother solution of
truncated triangular and rod-shaped nanoparticles, ﬁnally
leading to complete killing of the bacterial cells.
The surface structures of both the untreated (Fig. 8A) and
the treated bacterial cells (Fig. 8B) were examined using
EFTEM. The treated bacterial cells were signiﬁcantly changed,
and major damage was observed in the outer membrane (Fig.
8C). Nanoparticles that accumulated in the membrane as well
as some penetrating the cells can also be discerned in the
EFTEM micrograph.
DISCUSSION
The size of metallic nanoparticles ensures that a signiﬁcantly
large surface area of the particles is in contact with the bacte-
rial efﬂuent. Considering a hypothetical case with spherical
particles of uniform size, a reduction in the particle size from
10 m to 10 nm will increase the contact surface area by 109.
Such a large contact surface is expected to enhance the extent
of bacterial elimination. However, smallness in itself is not the
goal. Synthesis and characterization of nanoscaled materials in
terms of novel physicochemical properties is of great interest in
the formulation of bactericidal materials.
Although growth on agar plates is a more ready means of
distinguishing antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles
of different shapes, in this study liquid-growth experiments
showed basically similar results. But a previous study (31)
pointed out a distinct difference between these two methods.
In our study, complete inhibition of bacterial growth was ob-
served on agar plates supplemented with nanoparticles (Fig. 4
and 5). It is noteworthy that inhibition depends on the con-

centration of the silver nanoparticles as well as on the initial
bacterial number. On the other hand, silver nanoparticles in
liquid medium, even at high concentrations, caused mainly a
growth delay of E. coli (Fig. 6). Growth of bacterial cells
resumed rapidly with a decrease in the concentration of nano-
particles. Sondi and Salopek-Sondi (31) showed that interac-
tion of these particles with intracellular substances from the
lysed cells caused their coagulation and the particles were
thrown out of the liquid system.
The decay curves shown in Fig. 7a can be explained similarly.
In the mother liquor of truncated triangular and rod-shaped
nanoparticles, silver particles with different shapes were
present in the micelles of the cationic quaternary ammonium
surfactant CTAB. The surfaces of E. coli ATCC 10536 cells
have a negative charge. Thus, the addition of a nanoparticle
solution with a certain amount of cationic surfactant to the
bacterial suspension probably led to coagulation of the nano-
particles via a charge neutralization mechanism. The low col-
loidal stability of the nanoparticles resulted in a decrease of
effective silver concentration in the broth medium. However,
most likely due to a synergistic effect of the cationic surfactant
and silver nanoparticles, a decay curve was obtained, ﬁnally
leading to complete cell death. Coagulation via a charge neu-
tralization mechanism is most effective at an optimum coagu-
lant dose under a particular set of experimental conditions
(temperature, pH, and mixing speed). Most probably in our
study, under the given experimental conditions, the nanopar-
ticle levels of 6 to 12 g correspond to the optimum surfactant
concentration for effective coagulation, and a slower killing
curve was obtained. At a level lower than the optimum nano-
particle level (and hence the optimum surfactant level) (e.g., 1
g of silver), complete charge neutralization does not happen,
whereas at a higher level (e.g., 50 or 100 g), due to charge
reversal the nanoparticles regain their colloidal stability, lead-
ing to poor or ineffective coagulation. Consequently, in those
cases the killing is either much faster or immediate. A control
experiment with the same amount of surfactant dose (but with-
out silver nanoparticles) produced similar types of graphs (data
not shown), though with a much lower killing rate, and con-
ﬁrmed the previous observations.
Reports on the mechanism of inhibitory action of silver ions
on microorganisms show that upon Ag treatment, DNA loses
its replication ability (10) and expression of ribosomal subunit
proteins as well as some other cellular proteins and enzymes

essential to ATP production becomes inactivated (40). It has
also been hypothesized that Ag primarily affects the function
of membrane-bound enzymes, such as those in the respiratory
chain (3, 23).
However, the mechanism of bactericidal actions of silver
nanoparticles is still not well understood. In a previous report
(31) on the bactericidal activity of silver nanoparticles, it was
shown that the interaction between silver nanoparticles and
constituents of the bacterial membrane caused structural
changes in and damage to membranes, ﬁnally leading to cell
death.
We speculate that the action of silver nanoparticles is
broadly similar to that of silver ion. It may be anticipated that
a bacterial cell in contact with silver nanoparticles takes in
silver ions, which inhibit a respiratory enzyme(s), facilitating
the generation of reactive oxygen species and consequently
damaging the cell. The uptake of silver can be recognized by
irregular pits (Fig. 8C). Silver (soft acid) has a greater tendency
to react with sulfur- or phosphorus-containing soft bases, such
as R-S-R, R-SH, RS, or PR3. Thus, sulfur-containing proteins
in the membrane or inside the cells and phosphorus-containing
elements like DNA are likely to be the preferential sites for
silver nanoparticle binding (3, 23). Figure 8C is an enlarged
image of a part of a severely damaged cell membrane treated
with truncated triangular silver nanoplates. It has been sug-
gested (31) that disruption of membrane morphology may cause
a signiﬁcant increase in permeability, leading to uncontrolled
transport through the plasma membrane and, ﬁnally, cell death.
Although the ﬁndings regarding interaction with E. coli were
similar among nanoparticles with markedly different shapes,
the inhibition results were not the same. The differences in the
observed trends in E. coli inhibition can be explained in terms
of the percent active facets present in nanoparticles of different
shapes. The OPML-XRD pattern (Fig. 3) shows that the top
basal plane of a truncated triangular nanoplate is a {111} surface.
Spherical silver nanoparticles (generally with a cubooctahedral or
multiple-twinned decahedral or quasi-spherical morphology) pre-
dominantly have {100} facets along with small percentage of
{111} facets, while in case of the rod-like silver nanoparticles
(e.g., pentagonal rods), side surfaces are bound by {100} and the
ends by {111} facets (38). It has been demonstrated that the
reactivity of silver is favored by high-atom-density facets such as
{111} (1, 13). Morones et al. (25) proved the faceting of the
particles as well as the direct interaction of the {111} facets with
the bacterial surface. Thus, a high reactivity of the truncated
triangular nanoplates, as found in this study, in comparison to
other particles that contain fewer than {111} facets, like spherical
or rod-shaped particles, is expected.
In conclusion, we have found that silver nanoparticles un-
dergo shape-dependent interaction with the gram-negative
bacterium E. coli. The interactions of silver nanoparticles with
biosystems are just beginning to be understood, and these
particles are increasingly being used as microbicidal agents. It
may be speculated that silver nanoparticles with the same sur-
face areas but with different shapes may also have different
effective surface areas in terms of active facets. Though at
present we are unable to give an estimation of how the surface
areas of different nanoparticles inﬂuence their killing activity
or to relate the bacterial killing capacity of silver nanoparticles
with their effective surface areas, our results provide a basis for
the measurement of shape-dependent bacterial activity of sil-
ver nanoparticles. However, it is imperative that the ﬂexibility
of nanoparticle preparation methods and their inﬂuence on
other bacterial strains be explored.
