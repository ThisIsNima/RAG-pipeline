This article explains the history, from 1600 BC to 2008, of materials that are today termed ‘plastics’. It
includes production volumes and current consumption patterns of ﬁve main commodity plastics: poly-
propylene, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene and polyethylene terephthalate. The use of
additives to modify the properties of these plastics and any associated safety, in use, issues for the
resulting polymeric materials are described. A comparison is made with the thermal and barrier prop-
erties of other materials to demonstrate the versatility of plastics. Societal beneﬁts for health, safety,
energy saving and material conservation are described, and the particular advantages of plastics in
society are outlined. Concerns relating to littering and trends in recycling of plastics are also described.
Finally, we give predictions for some of the potential applications of plastic over the next 20 years.
Keywords: plastic; society; history; polymers; development
Humans have beneﬁted from the use of polymers since
approximately 1600 BC when the ancient Meso-
americans ﬁrst processed natural rubber into balls,
ﬁgurines and bands (Hosler et al. 1999). In the inter-
vening years, man has relied increasingly on plastics
and rubber, ﬁrst experimenting with natural polymers,
horn, waxes, natural rubber and resins, until the
nineteenth century, when the development of modern
thermoplastics began.
In 1839, Goodyear invented vulcanized rubber, and
Eduard Simon, a German apothecary, discovered poly-
styrene (PS). Developmental work continued through
the nineteenth century on natural/synthetic polymers
producing such notables as celluloid for billiard balls,
polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which is used in myriad
applications, and viscose (rayon) for clothing. Develop-
ment of modern plastics really expanded in the ﬁrst
50 years of the twentieth century, with at least 15 new
classes of polymers being synthesized. The success of
plastics as a material has been substantial; they have
proved versatile for use in a range of types and forms,
including natural polymers, modiﬁed natural polymers,
thermosetting
plastics,
thermoplastics
and,
more
recently, biodegradable plastics. Plastics have a range
of unique properties: they can be used at a very wide
range of temperatures, are chemical- and light-resistant
and they are very strong and tough, but can be easily
worked as a hot melt. It is this range of properties
together with their low cost that has driven the annual
worldwide demand for plastics to reach 245 million
tonnes (PlasticsEurope 2008) today. Even at a some-
what conservative annual growth rate of 5 per cent, a
continuation of this trend suggests that at least 308
million tonnes of plastics will be consumed annually
worldwide
by
2010
(PlasticsEurope
2008).
This
projected growth is mainly attributed to increasing
public demand for plastics. Here we summarize the
main types of plastic in use today.
Although literally hundreds of plastic materials are
commercially available, only a handful of these qualify
as commodity thermoplastics in terms of their high
volume and relatively low price. These plastics and
their fractional consumption on a global basis are
shown below. Low-density polyethylene (LDPE), high-
density PE (HDPE), polypropylene (PP), PVC, PS
and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) account for
approximately 90 per cent of the total demand and
will be discussed in more detail (ﬁgure 1).
1. COMMODITY PLASTICS
This group includes PP and PE. Polypropylene was
discovered in 1954 by Giulio Natta, and commercial
production of the resin began in 1957. It is the single
most widely used thermoplastic globally. It is a very
useful cost-effective polymer and can be injection-
moulded, blow-moulded, thermoformed, blown ﬁlm
extruded or extruded into a variety of products.
Examples of these include ﬂexible barrier ﬁlm pouches
(including the biaxially oriented packaging ﬁlm used for
crisps and nuts); stackable crates for transport and sto-
rage, caps and closures for containers, blow-moulded
bottles, thin-walled containers (e.g. margarine tubs,
yoghurt cups, food trays) used in the food industry;
and tree shelters, soil sieves, fork handles, mulch
ﬁlms, and glass replacement, window/door frames,
water or sewage pipes and geomembranes used in
building applications. Polypropylenes are also used
in household goods such as bowls, kettles, cat litter
trays; personal goods such as combs, hair dryers, ﬁlm
wrap for clothing; and in other packaged goods.
Polyethylene was discovered in March 1933 by
Reginald Gibson and Eric Fawcett, two research che-
mists at ICI’s Winnington Laboratory in the UK,
and it was ﬁrst synthesized as a low-density resin
(LDPE)
in
1935.

processes have since become more sophisticated and
cost-effective. Currently, there are about 25 different
processes for manufacturing the range of PEs and
metallocene-catalysed polyethylene (mPE). The latter
has superior toughness and is one of the most recent
and the fastest growing processes. Polyethylene is
presently the second most widely used class of resin
globally. There are several different grades of PE classi-
ﬁed according to the average density of the resin linear
LDPE
(LLDPE),
0.925 g cm23;
LDPE,
0.930–
0.935 g cm23; medium density polyethylene (MDPE),
0.93–0.945 g cm23; HDPE, 0.945–0.965 g cm23).
About a half of the 35 million tonnes of PE resin
produced is used to make plastic ﬁlm, followed by
13–14% in injection-moulded and blow-moulded
products. North American, western European and
Asian markets each consume approximately 25–30%
of the PE ﬁlm produced globally. Typical applications
of PE are in blow-moulded containers with volumes
ranging from a few millilitres such as detergent bottles
(200–500 cm3) and milk jugs (0.5–4 l) to hundreds of
litres such as water and chemical barrels. Film appli-
cations include carrier bags, sandwich bags, freezer
bags and cling wrap, and horticultural uses include
irrigation pipes, glass replacement and ﬁeld liners.
Polyethylene
is
also widely
used
as
a
dielectric
insulator in electrical cables.
Polyvinyl chloride was ﬁrst created by Eugen
Baumann in 1872, but it was not until the late 1920s
that the ﬁrst commercial production of PVC took
place in the USA. Large-scale production in Europe
followed during the next two decades. Most commod-
ity plastics have carbon and hydrogen as their main
component elements, but PVC differs by containing
chlorine (around 57% by weight) as well as carbon
and hydrogen. PVC as produced is in the form of a
white powder. This powder is not used by itself, but
blended with other ingredients to give formulations
that are suitable for use in a wide range of products.
According to Plastics Europe, annual world demand
for PVC is around 35 million tonnes, with a predicted
growth of approximately 1 per cent per annum until
2010. Approximately 40 per cent of global demand
is in Asia (with China accounting for the majority
of it). In considering applications for PVC, its chlorine
content makes it essentially non-combustible and PVC
is therefore used in buildings and furniture, including
window shutters, piping and upholstery. It is also
used as cling ﬁlms for both household and various
industrial applications.
Commercial production of PS was started in the
1930s by the German company BASF (I G Farben)
and
was
introduced
into
the
USA
in
1937.
Polystyrene is available in two main forms: a general
purpose grade and a high-impact grade in which the
PS is modiﬁed with polybutadiene. In 1954, The
Dow Chemical Company invented expanded PS,
which is widely recognized as an excellent insulating
medium for buildings (table 1) and as a mouldable
packaging material. Expanded PS cups and trays are
commonly used for consumer goods, while industrial
packaging protects high-value goods such as electronic
goods, TVs, washing machines and lighting during
transport. This is even true of Ferrari cars on car trans-
porters (author’s (M.A.N.) observation on the road
from Bologna to Verona, Italy).

Chemists Whinﬁeld and Dickson, employees of
the Calico Printers’ Association of Manchester, are
credited with the discovery of PET in 1941. It was
eventually licensed to DuPont for use in the USA
and to ICI for use in the rest of the world. Both
DuPont and ICI chemists went on to develop PET
ﬁbres. In the 1950s they produced the ﬁrst polyester
ﬁlms and in the early 1970s the ﬁrst polyester bottle
resins. Of the few polymers that are potentially suitable
for bottles, PET is the only plastic with a balance of
properties such as transparency (near 100% light
transmission in a bottle), gloss, lightweight and resist-
ance to carbon dioxide permeation (table 2). This has
resulted in the nearly full replacement of glass in
Europe for all but the most demanding applications
that require both an oxygen barrier and UV resistance
to protect the contents. In the authors’ opinion, it will
only be a matter of time before oxygen and UV barrier
issues are solved for PET, so that glass bottles can be
fully replaced. World demand is 14.5 million tonnes
per annum (PlasticsEurope 2008) and is increasing.
For example, usage of PET for carbonated drink bot-
tles (including beer) will continue to grow at a rate of
8 per cent per annum in the near future (ﬁgure 2).
2. PLASTICS ADDITIVES
Plastics are rarely used by themselves; typically, the
resins are mixed with other materials called ‘additives’
to enhance performance. These may include inorganic
ﬁllers (e.g. carbon or silica) to reinforce the plastic
material, thermal stabilizers to allow the plastics to be
processed at high temperatures, plasticizers to render
the material pliable and ﬂexible, ﬁre retardants to
discourage ignition and burning, and UV stabilizers to
prevent
degradation
when
exposed
to
sunlight.
Colorants, matting agents, opaciﬁers and lustre addi-
tives might also be used to enhance the appearance of
a plastic product. Additives are often the most expensive
component of a formulation, and the minimum quan-
tity needed to achieve a given level of performance is
generally used. The additives are intimately mixed
with the polymer or ‘compounded’ into a formulation
that is processed into the shape of the ﬁnal product.
The potential adverse health issues associated with
the use of speciﬁc additives, such as phthalate plasti-
cizers, have been raised (for recent reviews, see
Koch & Calafat 2009; Meeker et al. 2009; Oehlmann
et al. 2009; Talsness et al. 2009). A major issue in
deﬁning the problems associated with these additives
is a shared lack of understanding of the available
evidence.
Industries
spends
many
millions
of
euros in generating peer-reviewed evidence, which is
available to governments and academia. For example
consider Lynch et al. (1999), Hext et al. (1999),
Elliot et al. (1998), Kennedy et al. (2004) and
Andersen et al. (2006), all of whom published industry
sponsored research. In the opinion of the authors,
rarely is this type of evidence fully explored, discussed
and understood before governments, academics and
NGOs publicize their ﬁndings or concerns. An example
of this is the recent UK publication of the SIN list by
Chemsec (2008), which is an emotional call for the sub-
stitution of certain chemicals without full consultation or
discussion of evidence. In considering the use of addi-
tives in plastics, it is important to understand the risk
to the public of exposure at realistic levels. One should
consider Paracelsus—‘the dose is the poison’; a good
example of this the recent discussions on antimony cata-
lysts in PET. Following extensive research, a tolerable
daily intake (TDI)—a scientiﬁcally based estimate of
the amount of a substance, expressed on a body weight
basis that can be ingested daily over a lifetime without
appreciable risk—was established by the World Health
Organization (2003) for antimony. Yet Westerhoff et al.
(2008) inferred that the minute doses (ng/l) received
when consuming water bottled in PET were harmful.
The volume of bottled water that would need to be con-
sumed to reach the TDI is unrealistically high (300 l).
Hence, the potential risk from excessive intake of water
and the associated sodium salts is far higher than that
from the antimony.

A further instance where plastics additives were
criticized in the absence of adequate evidence is illus-
trated
by
bisphenol
A
(BPA)
exposure
from
polycarbonate products. Bisphenol A has a permanent
(lifetime
exposure)
TDI,
which
was set
by
the
European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in January
2007 and announced with a public statement that
‘People’s dietary exposure to BPA, including that of
infants and children, is estimated to be well below
the new TDI1’. However, BPA from drinking water
bottles has been cited as a signiﬁcant source of BPA
exposure of individuals (Lea et al. 2008). There have
also been instances where a real (as opposed to per-
ceived) risk associated with a plastics additive has
been identiﬁed based on extensive research, and
examples are given below. In such instances, the indus-
try has moved to eliminate or reduce the levels of the
identiﬁed additive.
Plasticizers are a particular group of additives that
has raised concerns; however, there are many types
of plasticizer (e.g. adipates, polymerics, trimellitates,
1,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylic
acid
diisononyl
ester,
citrates, phthalates, etc.) used in plastics. Of these,
about eight different types are in common use. It is
not possible to conduct a generalized risk assessment
on phthalates as a class of compounds used as plasti-
cizers. Some phthalates, e.g. diisononyl phthalate
and diisodecyl phthalate, have been through full
European Risk Assessments and have a completely
clean bill of health in all applications, whereas with
other phthalates such as dibutyl phthalate and diethyl
hexyl phthalate, risk-reduction measures are required
(described in the ECB published Risk Assessments
in the online ORATS (2008) database available from
The
Phthalates
Information
Centre
Europe)
to
ensure that safe use has been identiﬁed.
In summary, in most countries, the use of additives is
strictly controlled, particularly in critical applications
such as food contact and packaging of pharmaceuticals
and toys; their use is independently monitored by indi-
vidual government authorities to ensure that consumer
health and safety is protected (against exposure to any
additive that leaches from the plastic into the packaged
product). Examples of standards and controlling auth-
orities are the US Food and Drug Administration, the
US Environmental Protection Agency, Environment
Canada, the UK Food Standards Agency (DEFRA),
the European Chemicals Agency, the EFSA and the
World Health Organization (see discussion of policy
measures in Shaxson 2009).
3. PLASTICS CONSUMPTION
The consumption patterns of the ﬁve most widely used
types of plastics in their different application sectors
appear to be consistent in the developed regions of
the world. Well over a third of consumption is in
packaging applications (with common products such
as containers and plastic bags) and another third or
more
in
building
products
including
common
products such as plastic pipes or vinyl cladding.
In developing countries, usage patterns may differ
slightly; for instance, in India, 42 per cent of resin con-
sumption was reported to be in the packaging sector
(Mutha et al. 2006). Automotive applications and
toy/furniture manufacture use smaller but signiﬁcant
volumes of plastics. Use of plastics in the developing
world is increasing as the lower unit cost and improve-
ments
in
performance
speciﬁcations
continually
promote its substitution for materials such as paper,
metals, wood and glass.
Plastics clearly constitute an important component
of the range of materials used in modern society.
Almost all aspects of daily life involve plastics or
rubber in some form or the other. These include cloth-
ing and footwear, together with products for use in
food and public health applications. Over 40 million
tonnes of plastics were converted into textile ﬁbre
(mainly nylon, polyester and acrylics) worldwide for
use in apparel manufacture. Polycotton clothing con-
tains high levels of PET plastic; high-performance
clothing
is almost exclusively plastics—polyesters,
ﬂuoropolymers and nylons. Fleece clothing is 100
per cent plastic (PET) and can be made from recycled
PET. Most footwear also relies heavily on plastics; the
footbed and outsoles are made from polyurethane or
other elastomeric material while the uppers might be
made of vinyl or other synthetic polymer.
Plastics also deliver many public health beneﬁts.
They facilitate clean drinking water supplies and
enable medical devices ranging through surgical equip-
ment, drips, aseptic medical packaging and blister packs
for pills. They provide packaging that reduces food
wastage, for instance in the use of modiﬁed atmosphere
packaging (Mullan 2002) that prolongs the life of meat
and vegetables.
Owing to their light weight, plastics reduce transpor-
tation costs and, therefore, atmospheric carbon dioxide
emissions. Public and private transportation vehicles
can now contain up to 20 per cent plastics typically
as parcel shelves, door liners, steering wheels, electrics
and electronics, and recent aircraft such as the Boeing
Dreamliner is designed from up to 50 per cent plastics.
Plastics can also be used to improve the performance
and reduce the costs of building materials; examples
of this include lightweight ﬁxings, window and door
frames, ﬁxtures and insulation materials. Plastics also
save energy in a variety of other applications and
enhance the quality of many recreational activities,
World Cup standard footballs and other equipment
such as tennis, squash racquets and golf clubs use
nylons, polyether ether ketones, PP and polymeric
rubber compounds.
Plastics deliver unparalleled design versatility over
a wide range of operating temperatures. They have
a high strength-to-weight ratio, stiffness and toughness,
ductility,
corrosion
resistance,
bio-inertness,
high
thermal/electrical
insulation,
non-toxicity
and
out-
standing durability at a relatively low lifetime cost
compared with competing materials; hence plastics are
very resource efﬁcient. As reported by PlasticsEurope
(2008), plastics can be made from any feedstock con-
taining carbon and hydrogen. Currently, fossil fuels
are the preferred feedstock, but plastics are also made
from renewable resources such as sugar and corn.
Around 4 per cent of global oil and gas production is
used as the raw material for plastics production and a
similar amount is used as energy in the process.

However, plastics by their very nature store carbon, and
this energy is retained by reusing and recycling plastics.
4. PLASTIC LITTER
In common with all consumer materials, disposal of
plastic material contributes to the growth in municipal
waste and additionally produces urban litter. Urban
litter is increasing and contains large quantities of dis-
carded materials, including thermoplastic products.
Thermoplastics are not readily biodegradable in the
environment, and plastic litter can persist for extended
periods of time (Andrady 2003). The exact lifetime of
the discarded plastics depends on the chemical nature
of the material, characteristics of the environment in
which it is placed and also on how ‘degradation’ is
deﬁned or measured, and it is therefore highly variable.
Degradation can be by biological breakdown or by
environmental breakdown (wind, rain, sunlight); with
compostable plastics, this can occur within months but
will take considerably longer for conventional plastics
(Andrady 2003). In comparing plastics with other dis-
carded materials such as lignocellulosic paper, plastics,
because they are chemically resistant, are particularly
persistent in the environment and it is this longevity
that makes sourcing the origins of plastic litter very difﬁ-
cult. Littering, however, is a behavioural issue that needs
to be addressed primarily through education. More
attention and resources need to be devoted to increasing
the awareness of consumers about the environmental
consequences of litter, as this is the most effective sol-
ution.
For
example,
in
Singapore,
a
government
scheme with large ﬁnes and corrective work orders has
proved to be a very effective anti-littering measure.
A particularly disconcerting phenomenon is the
quantity of plastic litter that enters the world’s oceans,
mostly from land-based sources (Thompson et al.
2005; for recent reviews, see Barnes et al. (2009);
Gregory (2009); Ryan et al. (2009); Teuten et al.
(2009)).
This
litter,
estimated
by
the
author at
0.2–0.3% and derived from the report of Greenpeace
Allsopp et al. (2006)—Plastics Debris in the World’s
Oceans (2006) and plastics world production ﬁgures
(PlasticsEurope 2006) over the last 10 years, is from
tourists, sewerage overﬂows, landﬁll sites near coast-
lines,
illegal
dumping
and
accidental
industrial
spillages. The durability of plastics facilitates their use
in a wide range of applications (discussed earlier) that
also result in ecological concerns when this material
ends up as litter. With ﬁshing gear primarily made of
plastics and ﬁsh packaging boxes and other accessories
also made from plastics, it is not surprising that ﬁshing-
related debris also end up in the world’s oceans.
5. SOCIETAL BENEFITS OF PLASTICS
(a) Improved consumer health and safety
Plastics contribute to the health and safety of consu-
mers
in
food
and
water
packaging
applications.
Water has become a critical focus in urban areas, and
plastics provide the mechanism for the supply and
storage of clean drinking water. Additionally, plastics
are lightweight, easy to manufacture and are installed
in a range of diverse water control and distribution
systems (e.g. sewerage, storm water, land drainage
and irrigation). Plastic food packaging allows safe,
time-dependent storage of fresh produce and other
food,
using
temperature
and atmosphere control
inside the package (using gas-ﬂush packaging and
oxygen scavenger technology). In addition, the quality
of packaged foods (especially time–temperature his-
tory) can be monitored with low-cost indicator labels
built into the packaging (M. A. Neal 1990–1995,
personal communication).
6. ENERGY SAVINGS
Using plastics in transportation building and even
packaging applications invariably results in very signiﬁ-
cant savings in materials and in fossil fuel energy. For
example, a comprehensive study published in January
2005, GUA (Gesellschaft fu¨r umfassende Analysen
GmbH) established that packaging beverages in PET
versus glass or metal reduces energy consumption by
52% (83.2 GJ yr21 in Europe alone). Greenhouse gas
emissions were reduced 55% on the same basis (4.3
million tonnes CO2 eq yr21 in Europe). Use of lighter
plastic composites in place of metal in the design of
newer aircraft results in signiﬁcant fuel cost savings
as well as easier assembly. The new Boeing 787,
for instance, will have a skin that is 100 per cent
composite and an interior that is 50 per cent plastic
composite, allowing it to deliver an expected 20 per cent
savings in fuel costs. In the automotive sector, the
replacement of metal components by plastic compo-
sites that weigh less than 50 per cent of the original
contributes to signiﬁcant energy savings. Aluminium
can also be replaced with plastic components that are
50 per cent lighter at a 20–30% saving in cost. For
example, the average plastic content of a light vehicle
has increased to 110 kg or approximately 12 per cent
of its weight (Gehm 2006).
In a recent study, the energy expenditure in manu-
facturing a disposable foamed polystyrene cup was
found to be much lower than that for a ceramic cup
or a disposable paper cup. When cleaning is factored
in, in terms of energy use, it would take several hundred
uses for a reusable ceramic cup to match that associated
with a single-use expanded polystyrene cup (Hocking
2006).
A
similar
study
by
the
Dutch
Research
Institute TNO (2007) conﬁrmed Hocking’s ﬁndings.
7. MATERIAL CONSERVATION
Plastics have the advantage of a high strength-to-weight
ratio, allowing minimal material usage (and low cost) in
packaging design (ﬁgure 3b, which illustrates the use of
plastics and glass packaging for the same product). On
average, plastic packaging accounts for between 1 and 3
per cent of the total product weight. For instance, it
takes 2 g of plastic ﬁlm to package 200 g of cheese;
1.5 l of liquid can be safely stored in a 38 g bottle and
a tub containing 125 g of yoghurt weighs only 4.5 g.
The ecological balance sheet of plastic packaging, i.e.
the sum total of the corresponding energy consumption
for production, transport and disposal and other effects
on the environment, is often superior to that of compet-
ing materials. For example, in one study, in switching

from gable-top milk cartons (ﬁgure 3a) manufactured
from a paper/aluminium/plastic composite to plastic
pouches, the energy saving in production of the package
was estimated to be 72 per cent, a 50 per cent saving in
refrigeration space contributed to further energy savings
and the waste stream to landﬁll was reduced by 90 per
cent (API 1996).
The development of renewable energy resources is
likely to rise as a consequence of increasing oil
prices. Solar and wind power, geothermal heat and
biomass are inexhaustible. Already, some regions in
Europe are using renewable energy to meet most of
their heating, hot water and electricity requirements,
and Iceland exploits its geothermal energy. Plastics as
a material can drive innovative designs to support
this
effort.
For
instance,
modern
solar
water
heaters containing plastics such as PE and PVC can
provide up to 65 per cent of a household’s annual
hot water demand. Photovoltaic collectors that convert
solar energy into electricity can cover the remaining
energy requirements of a house. The use of these
technologies would be impossible without plastics’
light
weight,
mouldability,
UV
resistance
and
insulation properties.
Plastics capture around half of the carbon that is
used to produce them, and this is a valuable resource.
The properties of plastics make them inherently recycl-
able at several different levels (see the review by
Hopewell et al. 2009). Multiple strategies of reuse of
products, post-consumer recycling, resource recovery
in the form of fuels or chemicals and energy recovery
via incineration are all applicable to plastics waste, pro-
vided adequate waste management practices can be
adopted. Recycling is clearly an energy-saving strategy;
most
primary
recycling
and
the
post-consumer
recycling of high-value plastics make economic and
environmental sense and greatest beneﬁts are realized
when recycling is viewed as a material conservation
strategy. Mixed streams of plastics waste can be difﬁcult
to recycle. Here waste-to-energy via incineration allows
the high heat value of the post-consumer plastics to be
recaptured for use. The latter strategy is more advan-
tageous than with most other packaging, as plastics
have higher energy content than paper (table 3).
In most countries, as the available landﬁll space
becomes limited, both materials recycling and resource
or energy recovery will become increasingly attractive
solid-waste
management
options.
For
example,
in
Korea, household waste material from everyday life
and economic activities has decreased substantially,
from 1.3 kg per person per day in 1994 to 1.04 kg in
2002, and the rate of overall material recycling exceeded
that of landﬁlling for the ﬁrst time in 2002.
According
to
industrial
sources
(PlasticsEurope
2008), in Europe, the collection of waste plastics for con-
ventional recycling was 4.4 million tonnes in 2006, with
approximately
12
per
cent
of
this
being
traded
(exported) with Asia. A plastic product with an excep-
tionally high level of recycling is the plastic bottle.
Plastic bottles can be made of PET, PE, PP or PVC,
and according to Petcore (2007), 40 per cent of all
PET bottles available for collection were recycled in
the EU in 2006. This amounts to 1.1 million tonnes yr21.
The versatility of the recycling approaches available
for post-consumer plastics is summarized in ﬁgure 4.
The horizontal sequence indicates the main steps in
the product chain: feedstock acquisition, resin manu-
facture and fabrication and use of the product, each
associated with an energy Ei. The reuse of manufactur-
ing waste in the same product (regrind use) (A) is a
routine cost-saving step presently practised in plastic
product fabrication. Post-consumer waste can either
be refabricated into other products (usually of lower

form a feedstock (C). Each recycling strategy, how-
ever, has an energy EA, EB, EC associated with it;
depending on the comparison of energy demand for
recycling with Ei for the main steps in the production
and consumption sequence, energy savings via recycling
can be readily computed.
8. PLASTICS AND THE FUTURE
As suggested by the futurist Hammond (2007) in his
recent publication ‘The World in 2030’, the speed of
technological development is accelerating exponentially
and, for this reason, by the year 2030, it will seem as if a
whole century’s worth of progress has taken place in the
ﬁrst three decades of the twenty-ﬁrst century. In many
ways, life in 2030 will be unrecognizable compared
with life today. During this time, plastics will play a sig-
niﬁcantly increased role in our lives. Plastics are already
becoming ‘smart’ and will likely serve numerous impor-
tant roles in future living, including human tissue or
even organ transplants, key materials used in ultra-
low-emission lightweight cars and aircraft, superior
insulation for homes that run on photovoltaic technol-
ogy based on plastic collectors, reusable electronic
graphic media for books or magazines, smart packaging
that monitors food content continuously for signs of
spoilage and high-efﬁciency solid-state lighting based
on plastic organic diode technology. As petroleum
reserves become more limited, new varieties of plastics
are likely to increasingly be made from renewable bio-
mass. These will contribute to the already extensive
array of mechanical and aesthetic performance proper-
ties that plastics are well known for. Any future scenario
where plastics do not play an increasingly important
role in human life therefore seems unrealistic (see also
the discussions in Thompson et al. 2009a,b).
ENDNOTE
1Separately in its fact sheet ‘Authorisation under REACH’ (2006)
the Polycarbonate/Bisphenol A group of PlasticsEurope state:
‘According to the existing (2003) as well as the recent update
(2007) of the European Risk Assessment, BPA is not carcinogenic,
mutagenic or toxic for reproduction category 1 or 2, BPA is not
very persistent or very bioaccumulative (REACH Terminology—
vPvB), BPA is not eligible as a substance of equivalent concern
according to the latest available scientiﬁc information as BPA does
not fulﬁl the criteria of a substance having endocrine disrupting
properties’.
