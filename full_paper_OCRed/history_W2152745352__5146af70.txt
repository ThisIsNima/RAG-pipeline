Protein coding genes constitute only approximately 1% of the human
genome but harbor 85% of the mutations with large effects on
disease-related traits. Therefore, efﬁcient strategies for selectively
sequencing complete coding regions (i.e., ‘‘whole exome’’) have the
potential to contribute to the understanding of rare and common
human diseases. Here we report a method for whole-exome sequenc-
ing coupling Roche/NimbleGen whole exome arrays to the Illumina
DNA sequencing platform. We demonstrate the ability to capture
approximately 95% of the targeted coding sequences with high
sensitivity and speciﬁcity for detection of homozygous and heterozy-
gous variants. We illustrate the utility of this approach by making an
unanticipated genetic diagnosis of congenital chloride diarrhea in a
patient referred with a suspected diagnosis of Bartter syndrome, a
renal salt-wasting disease. The molecular diagnosis was based on the
ﬁnding of a homozygous missense D652N mutation at a position in
SLC26A3 (the known congenital chloride diarrhea locus) that is vir-
tually completely conserved in orthologues and paralogues from
invertebrates to humans, and clinical follow-up conﬁrmed the diag-
nosis. To our knowledge, whole-exome (or genome) sequencing has
not previously been used to make a genetic diagnosis. Five additional
patients suspected to have Bartter syndrome but who did not have
mutations in known genes for this disease had homozygous delete-
rious mutations in SLC26A3. These results demonstrate the clinical
utility of whole-exome sequencing and have implications for disease
gene discovery and clinical diagnosis.

G
enetic variation plays a major role in both Mendelian and
non-Mendelian diseases. Among the approximately 2,600
Mendelian diseases that have been solved, the overwhelming
majority are caused by rare mutations that affect the function of
individual proteins; at individual Mendelian loci, approximately
85% of the disease-causing mutations can typically be found in the
coding region or in canonical splice sites (1). For complex traits,
genome-wide association studies have identified more than 250
common variants associated with risk alleles that contribute to a
wide range of diseases (2, 3). To date, most of these impart small
effects on disease risk (e.g., odds ratio of 1.2); moreover, even when
extremely large studies have been performed, the vast majority of
the genetic contribution to disease risk remain unexplained (4–6).
These findings suggest that individually rare variants with relatively
large effect may account for a large fraction of this missing trait
variance. Indeed, studies addressing this question have documented
the presence of individually rare variants with relatively large effect
(7, 8). Consistent with the Mendelian model, coding variants have
proven to be prevalent sources of such rare variants.
These considerations motivate implementation of robust ap-
proaches to sequencing complete coding regions of genomes (i.e.,
the ‘‘exome’’). This has the potential to play a major role in disease
gene discovery and also in clinical use for establishing a genetic
diagnosis. As coding regions constitute only approximately 1% of
the human genome, this is a potentially efficient strategy for
identification of rare functional mutations, the more so given that
our current ability to interpret the functional consequences of
sequence variation outside coding regions is highly limited. The
utility of this approach has been demonstrated in cancer, in which
PCR amplification of individual exons has led to identification of
new somatic mutations with large effect (9); nonetheless, PCR
amplification of each coding sequence is cumbersome. Methods of
enriching targeted genomic segments by hybridization have been
used for 30 years (10), and have recently been extended to the whole
exome scale (11), although their utility has been limited by the large
amounts of genomic DNA required and by coupling to sequence
platforms of modest throughput. Key considerations in this process
will be cost effectiveness and completeness of the information
obtained.
We report the adoption of whole-exome capture on single arrays
on the Roche/NimbleGen platform to the Illumina sequencing
platform. We illustrate the utility of this approach by identification
of a rare mutation in a patient that led to an unexpected clinical
diagnosis.
Results
Coupling of NimbleGen Whole-Exome Capture to Illumina Sequencing.
The Roche/NimbleGen whole-exome array capture protocols were
developed for DNA sequencing on the 454 platform (11); because
the cost of sequencing on the Illumina platform is potentially
considerably lower, we adapted hybrid capture using the Nimble-
Gen 2.1M Human Exome Array to the Illumina DNA sequencing
platform (see Methods). These arrays tile oligonucleotides from
approximately 180,000 exons of 18,673 protein-coding genes and
551 micro-RNAs and comprise 34.0 Mb of genomic sequence.
Resulting sequence data were processed using an automated pipe-
line: quality filtered sequence reads were aligned to the reference
human genome (hg18) using Maq software (12). Single nucleotide
variants (SNVs) were detected using Samtools (13) and further
filtered (see Methods). For heterozygote calls we required at least
10 coverage by reads with different start sites, base call with
Phred-like (14) quality scores greater than 45, and the probability
of the frequency of major and minor alleles deviating from the
binomial distribution of at least 107. Rare SNVs that cluster within
1 kb were tagged and evaluated for mapping errors. SNVs were
annotated for effect on the encoded protein and for conservation
by comparison versus sequences of 43 vertebrate species (15) and
orthologues in fly and worm (see Methods).

Major changes in the protocol included shortening the length of
the genomic DNA used for hybridization from 250 to 150 bases,
which significantly increased the percentage of sequenced bases
mapping to targeted bases (from 29% to 37%). We varied strin-
gency by increasing the wash temperature from 47.5 °C to 53.5 °C.
The higher stringency increased the percentage of on-target bases
to 56%, but reduced breadth of coverage: at mean 30 per base
coverage, the percentage of bases read fewer than 10 times in-
creased from 7% to 23%.
In our current protocol, we captured and sequenced samples
from 5 Caucasian subjects to a mean depth of 44; these samples
were also genotyped on the Illumina 370K SNP platform. The
targeted bases constituted approximately 37% of all bases read
(Table 1). An additional 12% of bases were within 100 base pairs
of targeted sequences. The distribution of reads across all targeted
bases is shown in Fig. 1A, which demonstrates that nearly all
targeted bases are captured. Poorly captured bases, however, are
correlated across different capture experiments, with approxi-
mately 352 kb (1.0%) read fewer than 10 times in each capture
experiment. These underrepresented bases are predominantly from
segments with exceptionally high G-C composition [supporting
information (SI) Fig. S1]. We have captured 10 additional samples
with this protocol with similar enrichment. With a single lane of
Illumina sequencing using 75 base paired-end sequence using
Illumina pipeline v. 1.4, we were able to produce an approximate
mean 30 per-base coverage of the targeted bases, with 93% of
targeted bases read at least 10 times; at 60 coverage with 2 lanes,
97% were read at least 10 times.
To assess the effect of coverage depth on sensitivity to detect
sequence variants, one of these samples, GIT 264–1, was further
sequenced to a mean depth of 99 and the genotype calls at known
SNP positions were compared versus the results obtained with
genotype calls on the Illumina 370K chip. At this depth of mean
coverage, the sensitivity of exome sequencing for detecting ho-
mozygous and heterozygous variants was 99.8% and 98.2%, re-
spectively (Fig. 1C). Sensitivity increased steeply as coverage in-
creased from 5 to 20, then more gradually thereafter, reaching
a final plateau at approximately 50. At any mean depth of
coverage, there is a range of coverage at each base, and the ability
to call heterozygous bases varies with the exact read coverage. Thus,
the sensitivity to detect heterozygous variants with 10 reads is
78.6%, but increases to 95.2% at 20 and approximately 100% at
30 and greater (Fig. 1D). The overall per-base error rate for this
sample was 0.75%, with error rate increasing approximately 10-fold
from base 20 to base 75 (Fig. 1B).
Among the 5 test samples, we found a mean of 20,356 exomic
variations from the reference sequence per subject (Table 1). An
average of 1,055 per exome are not previously reported to our
knowledge [i.e., not in the reference genome or 4 individual
published genomes (16–19)] and were classified as novel. The small
fraction of novel variants is consistent with a very high specificity for
variant detection. These variants included a mean per exome of
12,372 coding SNVs (cSNVs; 642 novel), of which there were 5,341
missense variants (368 novel), 32 premature termination codons (7
novel), 81 canonical splice site variants (7 novel), and 6,815 syn-
onymous substitutions (240 novel). Among the novel missense
variants, 147 per exome introduce substitutions that are highly
conserved among vertebrates, and among these, 40 are at positions
that are also conserved in Drosophila melanogaster and/or Caeno-
rhabditis elegans. Of the previously unreported exomic variants, 166
were shared among 2 or more subjects.
In subjects such as GIT 264–1 who are the product of consan-
guineous union (as described later), large segments of the genome
are homozygous by descent; in these segments, all variations from
the major allele can be considered errors, and heterozygous calls in
such segments provide a further estimate of specificity (a small
fraction of these could be bona fide de novo mutations). In this
subject, 462 Mb of the genome were homozygous by descent as
determined by genotyping (defined as segments of 100 consec-
utive SNPs spanning 1 Mb with 98% homozygosity; Table S1),
including 5.3 Mb of the exome, comprising 2,459 genes. In these
homozygous segments there was 1 heterozygous call at 99 cov-
erage. This leads to an estimated false heterozygote discovery rate
of 6 per exome and specificity for heterozygous calls of 99.9%. The
specificity remains 99.9% at mean coverage of 30. Interestingly,
the false-positive call is present in the SNP database, so if one
considers only novel variants in these calculations, specificity would
be 100% at both levels of coverage.
These findings demonstrate a protocol of sufficient sensitivity
and specificity to be highly useful for detecting rare sequence
variants across the whole exome.

(Fig. 2). Blood pressure was 90/55 mmHg and laboratory evaluation
was notable for serum K level of 2.8 mmol/L, HCO3 level of 36
mmol/L; plasma renin activity and serum aldosterone levels were
markedly elevated (Table 2). Despite volume depletion, his diapers
were noted to be wet. The differential diagnosis of the admitting
physician and consultants was broad, including a renal defect such
as Bartter syndrome; however, a neurologic defect or an infectious
process was not excluded. A venous blood sample was obtained and
genomic DNA was prepared.
Molecular Genetic Analysis. From the history, it was inferred that the
patient likely had a recessive genetic trait. Genome-wide SNP
genotyping was performed as described earlier. To search for copy
number variants, the SNP data were interrogated by using a
likelihood ratio-based copy number variant detection algorithm
(see Methods). Within the homozygous-by-descent segments, 20
homozygous deletions were identified. All these were previously
reported in the Database of Genomic Variants (20); none of these
alter protein coding sequences (Table S2). No homozygous dupli-
cations were identified. Interestingly, none of the known loci for
Bartter syndrome were within segments of homozygosity.
Analysis of Whole-Exome Sequence of Subject GIT 264–1. Given the
diagnostic uncertainty, this patient’s genomic DNA was subjected
to whole-exome sequencing as described earlier. A total of 143
million reads passed quality assessment and 95.0% aligned to the
human reference sequence; 38.4% of the total bases mapped to the
targeted bases with mean coverage of 99. At this depth of
coverage, 99.3% of the bases were read at least 5 times and 98.4%
of the bases were read at least 10 times (Table S3).
Mutation in SLC26A3. We anticipated finding a homozygous disease-
causing mutation within a segment that is homozygous by consan-
guineous descent. We consequently sought novel and rare muta-
tions that alter the encoded protein within the 5.3M base pairs and
2,495 genes in these segments. We identified 2,405 homozygous
variations, including 1,493 homozygous cSNVs, from the reference
sequence in these segments. These cSNVs included 668 non-
synonymous substitutions (29 of which were novel), 791 synony-
mous coding variants (16 novel), 12 canonical splice site variants (0
novel) and 19 coding region indels (0 novel; Table S4). There were
3 premature termination codons in these segments (0 novel). The
remaining 931 variants were in introns, UTRs, or intergenic regions.
All of the novel missense variants were confirmed by Sanger
sequencing of PCR-amplified segments, confirming the high spec-
ificity for detection of rare variation.
Substitutions at positions that are completely conserved from
invertebrates to humans are highly likely to disrupt normal
protein function (8), and we ranked the novel missense variants
by conservation scores to identify the most likely functional
mutations using the phyloP conservation score (Table S4). Ten
of the homozygous variants were at highly conserved positions
(i.e., score 2).
Among the novel homozygous mutations at extremely conserved
positions, one strongly stood out: a single-base substitution that
introduced a missense variant in SLC26A3 (Fig. 3). This mutation
was identified in 172 of 173 reads covering this base; reads of this
base had divergent start and end points and were read from both
strands; the remaining read of this base was neither WT nor this
mutant (Fig. 3A). The identity and homozygosity of this mutation
was confirmed by PCR amplification and direct Sanger sequencing
(Fig. 3B). This mutation introduces a D652N substitution at a
position that is completely conserved among all invertebrates and
vertebrates studied (Fig. 3C). This residue is also identical in 8 of
9 human paralogues (Fig. 3D); the only exception, SLC26A11, has
glutamate rather than aspartate at the corresponding position. This
mutation is noteworthy because SLC26A3 encodes an epithelial
Cl/HCO3 exchanger comprising 764 aa (Fig. 3E); recessive loss
of function mutations in this gene are known to cause congenital
chloride-losing diarrhea [CLD; i.e., OMIM 214700 (21)] in humans
and mice (22). The D652N mutation lies in a -pleated sheet in the
STAS domain (Sulfate Transporters and bacterial Anti-Sigma
factor antagonists) of the protein (Fig. 3E), which is known to be
required for both the activity and biosynthesis/stability of the
Fig. 1.

transporter. Indeed, other mutations at conserved positions in the
STAS domain have been shown to cause congenital chloride
diarrhea (23). This mutation was absent among 190 control chro-
mosomes. We identified no other compelling homozygous or
heterozygous candidates for disease-causing mutations outside
homozygous chromosome segments.
Our genetic findings strongly suggested that this patient had
congenital chloride diarrhea; the clinical findings of volume deple-
tion, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis are all consistent with
this diagnosis. This prompted clinical follow-up with the referring
physician to determine whether the volume loss was from renal or
gastrointestinal sources. Follow-up revealed that the patient indeed
had diarrhea that occurred every 1 to 2 h, which had been persistent.
Urinary electrolyte measurements with the patient volume replete
did not reveal hypercalciuria or other features of Bartter syndrome
(urinary Ca2:Cre ratio, 0.0076 mg:mg), indicating a primary
diagnosis of CLD.
Additional Patients with SLC26A3 Mutations. These findings led us to
consider whether additional subjects referred with a presumptive
diagnosis of Bartter syndrome might instead have CLD caused by
mutation in SLC26A3. This mistaken diagnosis is particularly likely
at the acute presentation: after volume and electrolyte resuscita-
tion, urinary electrolyte levels can be appropriately high (when in
balance, net intake and output are equal) but mistakenly inter-
preted as inappropriate, and volume loss from the urinary tract
versus the gastrointestinal tract may not be immediately discrimi-
nated in infants.
We consequently screened 39 subjects referred with a suspected
diagnosis of Bartter syndrome in whom mutations in NKCC2,
ROMK, ClC-Kb, and Barttin had not been identified. We found 5
additional patients who had homozygous mutations in SLC26A3
(Table 2 and Fig. 4). These mutations included 2 unrelated subjects
with a G187X premature termination codon, one with a frameshift
mutation at codon 454 resulting in premature termination at codon
458, one with the same D652N mutation found in the index case,
and one with a Y520C mutation (Y520 is completely conserved
among all vertebrates and invertebrates studied; Fig. 4F). All these
mutations are considered novel except for the G187X mutation,

which is a known founder mutation for congenital chloride diarrhea
in Saudi Arabia (24). None of these mutations were found in
sequencing of 190 control chromosomes from unrelated Caucasian
subjects. All these patients had hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis,
and evidence of salt wasting. Follow-up with the referring physi-
cians in 3 cases documented that volume depletion was caused by
gastrointestinal losses from watery diarrhea and not renal losses; in
2 cases, high stool chloride level was documented (GIT 366–1, 112
mM; GIT 409–1, 148 mM; value should be 90 mM in CLD), a
finding that is pathognomonic for congenital chloride diarrhea. In
each of the 2 remaining cases, the patient was not available for
further evaluation.
Discussion
Our results demonstrate the utility of whole-exome sequencing,
coupling sequence capture on the NimbleGen platform and se-
quencing on the Illumina platform, for identification of rare vari-
ants and disease-causing mutations. The protocol used provided
sufficient enrichment to drastically reduce the amount of DNA
sequencing required to identify sequence variation in coding re-
gions. Virtually all the targeted bases can be captured by using the
current protocol albeit with varying efficiencies, and additional
efforts might further balance the coverage of poorly sequenced
bases. We estimate that exon capture reduces the cost of detection
of exonic mutations by a factor of 10 to 20 compared with
whole-genome sequencing, depending on the sensitivity pursued.
Using the current protocol, 2 lanes of capture sequence can produce
approximately 60 read depth per base, resulting in detection of
approximately 97.2% of the heterozygous bases; it is expected that,
among the approximate average of 402 protein-altering rare vari-
ants per exome, there will be a very small number of false-positive
variants. Increased reads per lane are expected to occur in the near
future, likely permitting virtually complete capture of variation in
a single lane of sequence, and further improvements in base calling
will likely occur as well, resulting in improvements in both sensitivity
and specificity.
During preparation of this manuscript, a related paper was
published that demonstrated development of a different platform
for whole-exome capture and sequencing on the Illumina instru-
ment (25). The targeted exons were similar, both based on the
consensus coding sequence database. The overall results are sim-
ilar, with both platforms showing high sensitivity and specificity. We
anticipate that it will be useful to have multiple platforms available
for performing whole-exome analyses.
We have demonstrated the utility of this platform by making an
unexpected genetic diagnosis in a patient with an undiagnosed
illness; to our knowledge, this has not been previously reported. The
diagnosis of congenital chloride diarrhea was not considered in the
referral differential diagnosis, but after identification of mutation in
SLC26A3 suggested the diagnosis, it was confirmed by follow-up
clinical evaluation. This example provides proof of concept of the
use of whole-exome sequencing as a clinical tool in evaluation of
patients with undiagnosed genetic illnesses. These findings further
underscore the ability to parse large quantities of sequence data to
produce clinically useful information that combines clues from the
clinical condition in conjunction with the genetic data to arrive at
a correct diagnosis. We can envision a future in which such
information will become part of the routine clinical evaluation of
patients with suspected genetic diseases in whom the diagnosis is
uncertain.
In addition to clinical genetics, we anticipate applications for
whole-exome sequencing that include discovery of genes and alleles
contributing to Mendelian and complex traits, and to somatic
mutations in cancers. For dominant traits, we expect that many
whose causes have not yet been identified are explained by alleles
that have been difficult to map by linkage analysis. Likely expla-
nations include traits with reduced penetrance, traits that show
substantial locus heterogeneity, and alleles that impair reproductive
fitness sufficiently that many affected subjects harbor de novo
mutations. The finding of independent de novo mutations in the
same gene among a small number of affected subjects would
constitute compelling evidence of disease causation. Similarly, with
locus heterogeneity, identification of a significant excess in the
number of independent mutations in the same gene versus that
expected by chance will constitute evidence that a disease gene has
been identified. Mapping data that constrain the location of the
disease locus, animal models that produce similar phenotypes, and
compelling biology can all contribute to identification of such loci;
however, in the absence of such information, inference from the
large number of variants in a single subject will be challenging.
For recessive traits, affected subjects arising from consanguine-
ous union contain substantial mapping information: in this setting,
the disease locus is expected to be homozygous within a segment
that is homozygous by descent from a recent ancestor. For first
cousins, this constrains the search on average to approximately 10%
of the exome. Detection of homozygous novel variants in these
segments is highly efficient at even low levels of per-base coverage
(e.g., 5); these considerations simplify the problem as there are
very few (approximately 29) rare homozygous protein-altering
variants in these segments. As described earlier, the finding of an
excess of independent mutations in the same locus will provide
compelling evidence that a disease locus has been identified, and
KO animal models may be particularly helpful as recessive muta-
tions so typically impart loss of function.
Finally, for complex traits, sequencing large numbers of cases/
controls or subjects at the tails of a quantitative distribution will
enable identification of genes preferentially harboring an excess of
rare functional mutations at one end of the distribution. The sample
sizes required to identify such loci are expected to be large for alleles
that have odds ratios of disease of 2 to 3 (26–28). Such studies can
be achieved either by whole-exome sequencing of all subjects or by
sequencing the exome of a subset of subjects followed by selective
sequencing of the most promising genes in follow-up studies. It is
of course likely that non-coding sequences will harbor some rare
variants with relatively large effect that would be missed by selective
sequencing of coding regions.

Additional patients with SLC26A3 mutations. Sanger sequence traces
of WT and 5 subjects with homozygous mutations in SLC26A3 are shown.
These include two subjects with premature termination at codon 187 (A and
B); a frameshift at codon 454 resulting from a single base deletion that leads
to termination at codon 458 (C); a second patient with the D652N mutation
(D); and a patient with a Y520C mutation (E). (F) Conservation of Y520 across

At present, the sequence of each new individual identifies
approximately 402 novel variants introducing changes in the en-
coded protein. Recognition of functional mutations among these
poses a challenge. Investigation of consanguineous kindreds for
recessive traits can reduce the search complexity by an order of
magnitude. Mutations that introduce truncations of the encoded
protein, or that occur at highly conserved positions, are more likely
to have functional effects and can be prioritized. In addition, as
databases are filled with exome sequences of large numbers of
subjects, the ability to distinguish low-frequency alleles descendent
from ancient ancestors from de novo or extremely rare mutations
recently introduced into the population will markedly improve,
permitting focusing attention on this smaller set of alleles. We
anticipate that whole-exome sequencing will make broad contribu-
tions to understanding the genes and pathways that contribute to
rare and common human diseases, as well as clinical practice.
Materials and Methods
Human Subjects. The study protocol was approved by the Yale Human Investi-
gation Committee. Consent for participation was obtained in accordance with
institutionalreviewboardstandards.PatientswerereferredforstudiesofBartter
syndrome, and consanguineous kindred subjects in whom no mutation in genes
causing Bartter syndrome had been identiﬁed were chosen for further analysis.
Genomic DNA was prepared from venous blood by standard procedures.
Targeted Sequence Capture. Genomic DNA was captured on a NimbleGen 2.1M
human exome array following the manufacturer’s protocols (Roche/NimbleGen)
withmodiﬁcationsattheW. M.KeckFacilityatYaleUniversity.DNAwassheared
bysonicationandadaptorswereligatedtotheresultingfragments.Theadaptor-
ligated templates were fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis and frag-
ments of the desired size were excised. Extracted DNA was ampliﬁed by ligation-
mediated PCR, puriﬁed, and hybridized to the capture array at 42.0 °C using the
manufacturer’s buffer. The array was washed twice at 47.5 °C and 3 more times
atroomtemperatureusingthemanufacturer’sbuffers.BoundgenomicDNAwas
eluted using 125 mM NaOH for 10 min at room temperature, puriﬁed, and
ampliﬁed by ligation-mediated PCR. The resulting fragments were puriﬁed and
subjected to DNA sequencing on the Illumina platform. Captured and non-
captured ampliﬁed samples were subjected to quantitative PCR to measure the
relative fold enrichment of the targeted sequence.
Sequencing. CapturedlibrariesweresequencedontheIlluminagenomeanalyzer
as single-end 50-, 74-, and 75-bp reads, or 75-bp paired-end reads, following the
manufacturer’s protocols. Image analysis and base calling was performed by
Illumina pipeline versions 1.3 and 1.4 with default parameters.
Analysis. Sequence reads were mapped to the reference genome (hg18) using
theMaqprogram(12).Readsoutsidethetargetedsequenceswerediscardedand
statistics on coverage were collected from the remaining reads using perl scripts.
For indel detection, BWA was used to allow gapped alignment to the reference
genome (29). SAMtools was used to call targeted bases, and any base call that
deviates from reference base was regarded as a potential variation (13). Addi-
tional ﬁlters were applied as described in the SI text. Identiﬁed variants were
annotated based on novelty, impact on the encoded protein, conservation, and
expression using an automated pipeline (SI Text).
Genotyping and Identification of Loss-of-Heterozygosity Intervals. Samples
were genotyped on the Illumina HumanCNV370-Duo BeadChips. Sample pro-
cessing and labeling were performed following the manufacturer’s protocols.
Plink v. 1.06 was used to identify homozygous intervals from subject GIT 264–1.
Aslidingwindowof50SNPswasusedonthetagSNPsandincludednomorethan
one possible heterozygous genotype. Resulting intervals have to meet the limit
of at least 100 SNPs and 1 Mb in size.
Copy Number Variation Prediction Algorithm. To predict possible deletion or
duplication events in the genome, LogR and B allele frequency data were
extracted from SNP array and normalized to the larger sample pool to remove
sample-speciﬁc noise. Based on the empirical distribution of LogR and B allele
frequency values from the validated deletion and duplication SNPs, for a given
SNP, the likelihoods of being 0, 1, 2, and 3 or more copies were calculated,
respectively. If more than one SNP supporting deletion or duplication arose
consecutively and the likelihood ratio of the SNPs exceeded threshold, they
were called a deletion or duplication.
DNA Sequencing. The ExonPrimer script (http://ihg2.helmholtz-muenchen.de/
ihg/ExonPrimer.html) was used to generate primers for ampliﬁcation of SLC26A3
coding exons using as a template genomic DNA of patients or controls (Table S5).
Products were analyzed via gel electrophoresis, and amplicons sequenced using
the forward or reverse primers. Disease-causing mutations were conﬁrmed by at
least 2 independent sequences from different primers.
Orthologues and Paralogues. Full-length orthologous and paralogous protein
sequences from vertebrate and invertebrate species and human paralogous
protein sequences were extracted from GenBank. Orthologues were con-
ﬁrmed based on database identity of annotation. If an orthologue could not
be identiﬁed, the closest paralogue (i.e., top ‘‘hit’’ of a BLAST search of the
respective proteome) was studied. Protein sequences were aligned using the
ClustalW algorithm. GenBank accession numbers are listed in the SI Text.
