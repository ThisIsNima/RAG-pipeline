The dilemma of the incapacitated patient who has
previously refused consent for surgery
What should doctors do if a patient is critically ill and unable to give consent to a procedure that he
or she has previously refused to consent to? Such a case is described below and discussed by a
medicolegal specialist and by an ethicist.
The case history
J McFadzean, J P Monson, J D Watson, J H Coakley
A 72 year old Italian woman who spoke little English
was admitted to hospital with a minor haemoptysis.
Her medical history was complex. She had asthma,
oesophageal varices, and recurrent small pulmonary
embolisms, and had undergone partial thyroidectomy
for a multinodular goitre. Her medication included
salbutamol,
ipratropium,
becotide,
warfarin,
and
thyroxine. Physical
examination
showed
that
the
patient weighed 105 kg and had a large neck swelling
that
extended
retrosternally.
Her
condition
was
otherwise stable.
A provisional diagnosis of minor pulmonary
embolism was made, and the patient was given
treatment to relieve symptoms overnight. The follow-
ing
morning
she
had
an
acute
upper
airway
obstruction as a result of haemoptysis. She was resus-
citated by the cardiac arrest team, intubated and venti-
lated, and was then transferred to the intensive care
unit, where her condition was stabilised and she was
sedated.
Bronchoscopy
showed
external
tracheal
compression with contact bleeding of the mucosa.
Computed
tomography
and
magnetic
resonance
imaging confirmed that she had a large neck swelling
(10 cm × 8 cm), which was probably a thyroid goitre.
It extended from the mandible to the carina and
encased all the major mediastinal blood vessels in its
path. It was concluded that acute bleeding into the
goitre caused upper airway obstruction and that the
haemoptysis resulted from erosion of the tracheal
wall.
Options for treatment
The endocrinologist (JM) who had followed this
patient up for many of years because of her goitre and
thyroid dysfunction reported that she had always
refused further thyroid surgery and had also refused to
have
sclerotherapy
for
oesophageal
varices.
He
suggested that she should continue to be given
supportive but conservative treatment in the intensive
care unit until she had recovered sufficiently to discuss
her options for treatment.
Surgery was considered to be potentially hazardous
because of the large retrosternal goitre affecting the
major blood vessels in the upper thorax. Cardio-
pulmonary bypass would probably have been required
but would have been dangerous because of the
patient’s poor physical state. The size and position of
the goitre (extending the length of the trachea) meant
that neither tracheostomy nor the insertion of a
tracheal stent was deemed feasible.
The options were discussed with the patient’s
husband, after which a surgeon entered the following
comment in the patient’s notes: “As next of kin, the
husband gave his consent for an operation to enable us
to proceed should an emergency arise.” The husband
insisted that his wife had been reluctant to have

surgery
because
she
had
been
given
conflicting
medical advice. He was concerned that she should have
“an operation to make her better.”
Decision and conflict
At this stage it was decided that the patient should be
woken up and extubated so that she could decide her
further treatment. Unfortunately, a trial of extubation
failed immediately because of upper airway obstruc-
tion. She was sedated again, her trachea was intubated,
and she was ventilated. Thyroidectomy seemed the
only treatment that would have enabled her to be
removed from ventilatory support, but this would have
been difficult technically.
There was conflict. The family wanted surgery to
proceed despite the patient’s previously documented
objections. Some of the clinical team also felt strongly
that surgery should be attempted. But doubts were
raised about the ethics of operating without consent on
a patient who had previously refused surgery. The only
solution seemed to be to seek a legal review of the case.
An attempt was made to collate all the clinical
information and decide a way forward by having a case
conference. This was pre-empted by the patient’s death
from a massive haemoptysis. Postmortem examination
showed that a large, malignant thyroid tumour had
infiltrated the trachea and eroded a major pulmonary
vessel.
When patients are critically ill and need surgery,
the options are usually discussed with the family,
but consent is given (for legal reasons) by the con-
sultants. This patient’s case was unusual in that she
had previously refused to consent to surgery for the
condition which was now threatening her life.
Consent may not be needed to save life
Patrick Hoyte
Dr McFadzean and colleagues had to wrestle with
some difficult problems over consent, but they had not
reached
a
definitive
conclusion
when
they
were
pre-empted by the patient’s sudden death. Three
particular strands of consent had to be considered in
this case—the patient’s competence to make a decision
about her treatment, her past rejection of surgery for
this condition, and her subsequent inability to give
consent to emergency surgery.
Competence
A competent adult patient has a fundamental right to
give,
or
withhold,
consent
to
any
examination,
investigation, or treatment. For the incompetent adult,
no mechanism exists in English and Welsh law for any
other person, or indeed a court, to authorise or
consent to treatment. In Scotland, however, an appli-
cation may be made to the Court of Session for
the appointment of a Tutor Dative who may deal
with issues of consent on behalf of an incompetent
patient.
1
While it is always good practice to involve relatives
or other carers in making decisions, they cannot, under
the law, take on the formal responsibility of giving con-
sent. Nor can the medical staff. How then is a patient’s
competence to be measured? In 1995 the British
Medical Association and the Law Society issued
guidance on the assessment of mental capacity (box).
2
These criteria are more usually applied to patients with
mental illness or mental handicap. In this case of
purely
physical
illness, however, the
patient
was
incapacitated because she was unconscious.
Past rejection and current crisis
According to Mr Justice Wall in the case of Tameside
Trust v CH, “A mentally competent patient has an
absolute right to refuse consent to medical treatment
for any reason, rational or irrational, or for no reason
at all, even where that decision will lead to his or her
own death.”
3 Some patients, while consenting gener-
ally and in advance to be treated for their condition,
may, for religious or other reasons, refuse consent for
specific aspects of treatment. An example is the
Jehovah’s Witness who will not allow a blood transfu-
sion, a restriction or advance directive that has to be
observed in all circumstances because the patient
wishes it to apply in all circumstances. To give a blood
transfusion in the face of such a restriction would lay
the medical attendants open to charges of battery.
Such a charge has already succeeded in the courts in
Canada.
4
When a patient is incapacitated or incompetent,
the
Law
Commission
has
recommended
careful
consideration of “the ascertainable past and present
wishes and feelings of the person concerned, and the
factors that person would consider if able to do so.”
5
This patient was on record as rejecting further thyroid
surgery. But had she really considered all the factors? It
is unlikely that the patient was ever asked “Will you
consent to an operation if the goitre cuts off your
windpipe?” And it is even more unlikely that she would
have refused. Her previous refusal to undergo surgery
was not relevant to the position while she was critically
ill, and could have been disregarded—in her best
interests.
Assessment of mental capacity: guidance from
BMA and Law Society
• Patients must be able to understand, in simple
language, what the medical treatment is: its purpose,
justification, benefits, risks, and alternatives
• Patients must understand the consequences of not
receiving the treatment
• Patients must be able to retain the information long
enough to make an effective decision; and make a free
choice without duress

If the clinicians were not prepared to accept this
hypothesis, they could have sought a legal remedy
through an urgent application to a High Court judge
for a declaration that an operation could lawfully be
performed (this is not the same as the court actually
giving consent). If, however, the patient really had been
asked the question about tracheal obstruction, and
had indeed said “No” to an operation under any
circumstances, then surgery could not have been con-
templated and any application to the court would have
failed.
Defining “necessary treatment”
“When a patient temporarily, or permanently, lacks
the capacity to give or to express consent to treatment,
it is axiomatic that treatment necessary to preserve
the life, health or wellbeing of the patient, may be given
without consent ... not only is it lawful for doctors to
provide necessary treatment to incapacitated patients,
but it will also often be their common-law duty to
do so.”
6 7
If a judge gives a declaration, the issue of consent
for whatever the surgeons believe to be the best form
of “necessary treatment” is resolved. Whether a techni-
cally difficult resection of the thyroid gland can really
be considered “necessary treatment” in this case must
be a clinical judgment. But clearly some members of
the clinical team believed that it was in the best
interests of the patient.

Previous refusal of consent may not be relevant
Arthur L Caplan, John Hansen-Flaschen
Over the past three decades informed consent has
become an extremely important aspect of the clinical
management of patients. Allowing patients to control
the nature and extent of the care they are given has
become an inviolable moral value. Patient autonomy
takes precedence over both professional beneficence
and the contrary wishes of others. Any decision to vio-
late a patient’s wishes would be condemned as intoler-
able paternalism at best—and manipulation, coercion,
or even assault at worst. Why then does this patient’s
case pose a moral problem?
Autonomy and the incapacitated patient
The moral problem arises because informed consent is
often not a reliable guide in the care of critically ill
patients. For a patient to exercise autonomy, several
conditions
must
be
met.
The
patient
must
be
competent; all options need to have been presented
and understood; and the patient must be able to
understand the consequences of pursuing different
courses of action.
1
In the emotionally charged and rapidly changing
environment of intensive care it is often difficult to
empower patients so that each of these prerequisites
for autonomy and, thus, informed consent, can be met.
Nor is it clear that previous expressions about the
nature and direction of care can be interpreted as
applying to newly emerging circumstances.
It is clear that this patient did not want surgery as
the treatment of choice for managing her goitre or
oesophageal varices. But her rejection of surgical treat-
ment for these disorders sheds little light on whether
she would have been prepared to accept surgery if it
were needed to save her life. Clearly, her husband
rejected such a generalisation.
Limits of moral sense
The other reason that informed consent is not always a
reliable guide in the circumstances of intensive care
unit is that those providing care are often uncertain
about prognosis and uncomfortable about admitting
that they have reached the end of what can reasonably
be done for the patient. The clinical facts presented in
this patient’s case make it hard to believe that any treat-
ment would have been capable of fulfilling her
husband’s wish “to make her better.”
Prolonging life in the intensive care unit may not
mean providing a cure, but rather protracting a
severely compromised life. If doctors are reluctant to
give treatments that can restore health because they do
not have the patient’s explicit consent, respect for
autonomy is being taken beyond the limits of moral
sense. Want of specific consent should never mean that
a sedated patient in an intensive care unit is not given
curative treatment.
However, doctors need to distinguish between pro-
viding obvious benefit to a patient who cannot consent
and simply prolonging the dying or suffering of a
patient who can no longer protest. In this patient’s case,
the clinical picture seems to have grown so bleak that
surgery was to be avoided—not because of lack of the
patient’s consent but because it would surely have pro-
duced an unsatisfactory result.
Patient autonomy should guide care. When a criti-
cally ill patient cannot be consulted, however, the judg-
ments of doctors must be tempered by experience and
humility.

Meta-analysis
Principles and procedures
Matthias Egger, George Davey Smith, Andrew N Phillips
Meta-analysis is a statistical procedure that integrates
the results of several independent studies considered
to be “combinable.”
1 Well conducted meta-analyses
allow a more objective appraisal of the evidence than
traditional narrative reviews, provide a more precise
estimate of a treatment effect, and may explain hetero-
geneity between the results of individual studies.
2 Ill
conducted meta-analyses, on the other hand, may be
biased owing to exclusion of relevant studies or
inclusion of inadequate studies.
3 Misleading analyses
can generally be avoided if a few basic principles are
observed. In this article we discuss these principles,
along with the practical steps in performing meta-
analysis.
Observational study of evidence
Meta-analysis should be viewed as an observational
study of the evidence. The steps involved are similar to
any other research undertaking: formulation of the
problem to be addressed, collection and analysis of the
data, and reporting of the results. Researchers should
write in advance a detailed research protocol that
clearly states the objectives, the hypotheses to be tested,
the subgroups of interest, and the proposed methods
and criteria for identifying and selecting relevant stud-
ies and extracting and analysing information.
As
with
criteria
for
including
and
excluding
patients in clinical studies, eligibility criteria have to be
defined for the data to be included. Criteria relate to
the quality of trials and to the combinability of
treatments, patients, outcomes, and lengths of follow
up. Quality and design features of a study can influence
the results.
4 5 Ideally, researchers should consider
including only controlled trials with proper randomi-
sation of patients that report on all initially included
patients according to the intention to treat principle
and with an objective, preferably blinded, outcome
assessment.
6 Assessing the quality of a study can be a
subjective
process,
however,
especially
since
the
information reported is often inadequate for this pur-
pose.
7 It is therefore preferable to define only basic
inclusion criteria and to perform a thorough sensitivity
analysis (see below).
The strategy for identifying the relevant studies
should be clearly delineated. In particular, it has to be
decided whether the search will be extended to include
unpublished studies, as their results may systematically
differ from published trials. As will be discussed in later
articles, a meta-analysis that is restricted to published
evidence may produce distorted results owing to such
publication
bias.
For
locating
published
studies,
electronic databases are useful,
8 but, used alone, they
may
miss
a
substantial
proportion
of
relevant
studies.
9 10 In an attempt to identify all published
controlled trials, the Cochrane Collaboration has
embarked on an extensive manual search of medical
journals
published
in
English
and
many
other
languages.
11 The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register
12
is probably the best single electronic source of trials;
however, citation indices and the bibliographies of
review articles, monographs, and the located studies
should also be scrutinised.
A standardised record form is needed for data col-
lection. It is useful if two independent observers extract
the data, to avoid errors. At this stage the quality of the
studies may be rated, with one of several specially
designed scales.
13 14 Blinding observers to the names of
the authors and their institutions, the names of the
journals, sources of funding, and acknowledgments
leads to more consistent scores.
14 This entails either
photocopying papers, removing the title page, and
concealing journal identifications and other character-
istics with a black marker, or scanning the text of
papers into a computer and preparing standardised
formats.
15 16
Standardised outcome measure
Individual
results
have
to
be
expressed
in
a
standardised format to allow for comparison between
studies. If the end point is continuous—for example,
blood pressure—the mean difference between the
treatment and control groups is used. The size of a dif-
ference, however, is influenced by the underlying
population value. An antihypertensive drug, for exam-
ple, is likely to have a greater absolute effect on blood
pressure in overtly hypertensive patients than in
borderline hypertensive patients. Differences are there-
fore often presented in units of standard deviation. If
the end point is binary—for example, disease versus no
disease, or dead versus alive) then odds ratios or
Summary points
Meta-analysis should be as carefully planned as
any other research project, with a detailed written
protocol being prepared in advance
The a priori definition of eligibility criteria for
studies to be included and a comprehensive
search for such studies are central to high quality
meta-analysis
The graphical display of results from individual
studies on a common scale is an important
intermediate step, which allows a visual
examination of the degree of heterogeneity
between studies
Different statistical methods exist for combining
the data, but there is no single “correct” method
A thorough sensitivity analysis is essential to
assess the robustness of combined estimates to
different assumptions and inclusion criteria

relative risks are often calculated (box). The odds ratio
has convenient mathematical properties, which allow
for ease in combining data and testing the overall effect
for
significance. Absolute
measures, such
as
the
absolute risk reduction or the number of patients
needed to be treated to prevent one event,
17 are more
helpful when applying results in clinical practice (see
below).
Statistical methods for calculating overall
effect
The last step consists in calculating the overall effect by
combining the data. A simple arithmetic average of the
results from all the trials would give misleading results.
The results from small studies are more subject to the
play of chance and should therefore be given less
weight. Methods used for meta-analysis use a weighted
average of the results, in which the larger trials have
more influence than the smaller ones. The statistical
techniques to do this can be broadly classified into two
models,
18 the difference consisting in the way the vari-
ability of the results between the studies is treated. The
“fixed effects” model considers, often unreasonably,
that this variability is exclusively due to random varia-
tion.
19 Therefore, if all the studies were infinitely large
they would give identical results. The “random effects”
model
20 assumes a different underlying effect for each
study and takes this into consideration as an additional
source of variation, which leads to somewhat wider
confidence intervals than the fixed effects model.
Effects are assumed to be randomly distributed, and
the central point of this distribution is the focus of the
combined effect estimate. Although neither of two
models can be said to be “correct,” a substantial differ-
ence in the combined effect calculated by the fixed and
random effects models will be seen only if studies are
markedly heterogeneous.
18
Bayesian meta-analysis
Some statisticians feel that other statistical approaches
are more appropriate than either of the above. One
approach uses Bayes’s theorem, named after an 18th
century English clergyman.
21 Bayesian statisticians
express their belief about the size of an effect by speci-
fying some prior probability distribution before seeing
the data, and then they update that belief by deriving a
posterior probability distribution, taking the data into
account.
22 Bayesian models are available under both
the
fixed
and
random
effects
assumption.
23
The
confidence interval (or more correctly in bayesian ter-
minology, the 95% credible interval, which covers 95%
of the posterior probability distribution) will often be
wider than that derived from using the conventional
models because another component of variability, the
prior distribution, is introduced. Bayesian approaches
are controversial because the definition of prior prob-
ability will often be based on subjective assessments
and opinion.
Heterogeneity between study results
If the results of the studies differ greatly then it may not
be appropriate to combine the results. How to
ascertain whether it is appropriate, however, is unclear.
One approach is to examine statistically the degree of
similarity in the studies’ outcomes—in other words, to
MARK HUDSON
Odds ratio or relative risk?
Odds and odds ratio
The odds is the number of patients who fulfil the
criteria for a given endpoint divided by the number of
patients who do not. For example, the odds of
diarrhoea during treatment with an antibiotic in a
group of 10 patients may be 4 to 6 (4 with diarrhoea
divided by 6 without, 0.66); in a control group the
odds may be 1 to 9 (0.11) (a bookmaker would refer to
this as 9 to 1). The odds ratio of treatment to control
group would be 6 (0.66÷0.11).
Risk and relative risk
The risk is the number of patients who fulfil the
criteria for a given end point divided by the total
number of patients. In the example above the risks
would be 4 in 10 in the treatment group and 1 in 10 in
the control group, giving a risk ratio, or relative risk, of
4 (0.4÷0.1).

test for heterogeneity across studies. In such proce-
dures, whether the results of a study reflect a single
underlying effect, rather than a distribution of effects, is
assessed. If this test shows homogeneous results then
the differences between studies are assumed to be a
consequence of sampling variation, and a fixed effects
model is appropriate. If, however, the test shows that
significant heterogeneity exists between study results
then a random effects model is advocated. A major
limitation with this approach is that the statistical tests
lack power—they often fail to reject the null hypothesis
of homogeneous results even if substantial differences
between studies exist. Although there is no statistical
solution to this issue, heterogeneity between study
results should not be seen as purely a problem for
meta-analysis—it also provides an opportunity for
examining why treatment effects differ in different cir-
cumstances. Heterogeneity
should
not
simply
be
ignored after a statistical test is applied; rather, it should
be scrutinised, with an attempt to explain it.

Graphic display
Results
from
each
trial
are
usefully
graphically
displayed, together with their confidence intervals.
Figure 1 represents a meta-analysis of 17 trials of â
blockers in secondary prevention after myocardial
infarction. Each study is represented by a black square
and a horizontal line, which correspond to the point
estimate and the 95% confidence intervals of the odds
ratio. The 95% confidence intervals would contain the
true underlying effect in 95% of the occasions if the
study was repeated again and again. The solid vertical
line corresponds to no effect of treatment (odds ratio
1.0). If the confidence interval includes 1, then the dif-
ference in the effect of experimental and control treat-
ment is not significant at conventional levels (P > 0.05).
The area of the black squares reflects the weight of the
study in the meta-analysis. The confidence interval of
all but two studies cross this line, indicating that the
effect estimates were non-significant (P > 0.05).
The diamond represents the combined odds ratio,
calculated using a fixed effects model, with its 95% con-
fidence interval. The combined odds ratio shows that
oral â blockade starting a few days to a few weeks after
the acute phase reduces subsequent mortality by an
estimated 22% (odds ratio 0.78; 95% confidence inter-
val 0.71 to 0.87). A dashed line is plotted vertically
through the combined odds ratio. This line crosses the
horizontal lines of all individual studies except one (N).
This indicates a fairly homogenous set of studies.
Indeed, the
test
for
heterogeneity
gives
a
non-
significant P value of 0.2.
A logarithmic scale was used for plotting the odds
ratios in figure 1. There are several reasons that ratio
measures are best plotted on logarithmic scales.
25 Most
importantly, the value of an odds ratio and its
reciprocal—for example, 0.5 and 2—which represent
odds ratios of the same magnitude but opposite direc-
tions, will be equidistant from 1.0. Studies with odds
ratios below and above 1.0 will take up equal space on
the graph and thus look equally important. Also, confi-
dence intervals will be symmetrical around the point
estimate.
Relative and absolute measures of effect
Repeating the analysis by using relative risk instead of
the odds ratio gives an overall relative risk of 0.80 (95%
confidence interval 0.73 to 0.88). The odds ratio is thus
close to the relative risk, as expected when the outcome
is relatively uncommon (see box). The relative risk
reduction, obtained by subtracting the relative risk
from 1 and expressing the result as a percentage, is
20% (12% to 27%). The relative measures used in this
analysis ignore the absolute underlying risk. The risk of
death among patients who have survived the acute
phase
of
myocardial
infarction,
however,
varies
widely.
26 For example, among patients with three or
more cardiac risk factors the probability of death at two
years after discharge ranged from 24% to 60%.
26 Con-
versely, two year mortality among patients with no risk
factors was less than 3%. The absolute risk reduction or
risk difference reflects both the underlying risk without
treatment and the risk reduction associated with treat-
ment. Taking the reciprocal of the risk difference gives
the “number needed to treat” (the number of patients
needed to be treated to prevent one event).
17
For a baseline risk of 1% a year, the absolute risk
difference shows that two deaths are prevented per
1000 patients treated (table). This corresponds to 500
patients (1 ÷ 0.002) treated for one year to prevent one

death. Conversely, if the risk is above 10%, less than 50
patients have to be treated to prevent one death. Many
clinicians would probably decide not to treat patients at
very low risk, given the large number of patients that
have to be exposed to the adverse effects of â blockade
to prevent one death. Appraising the number needed
to
treat
from
a
patient’s
estimated
risk
without
treatment
and
the
relative
risk
reduction
with
treatment is a helpful aid when making a decision in an
individual patient. A nomogram that facilitates calcula-
tion of the number needed to treat at the bedside has
recently been published.
27
Meta-analysis using absolute effect measures such
as the risk difference may be useful to illustrate the
range of absolute effects across studies. The combined
risk difference (and the number needed to treat calcu-
lated from it) will, however, be essentially determined
by the number and size of trials in patients at low, inter-
mediate, or high risk. Combined results will thus be
applicable only to patients at levels of risk correspond-
ing to the average risk of the trials included. It is there-
fore generally more meaningful to use relative effect
measures for summarising the evidence and absolute
measures for applying it to a concrete clinical or public
health situation.
Sensitivity analysis
Opinions will often diverge on the correct method for
performing a particular meta-analysis. The robustness
of
the
findings
to
different
assumptions
should
therefore always be examined in a thorough sensitivity
analysis.
This
is
illustrated
in
figure
2
for
the
meta-analysis of â blockade after myocardial infarc-
tion. Firstly, the overall effect was calculated by different
statistical methods, by using both a fixed and a random
effects model. The figure shows that the overall
estimates are virtually identical and that confidence
intervals are only slightly wider with the random effects
model. This is explained by the relatively small amount
of variation between trials in this meta-analysis.
Secondly, methodological quality was assessed in
terms
of
how
patients
were
allocated
to
active
treatment
or
control
groups, how
outcome
was
assessed, and how the data were analysed.
6 The
maximum credit of nine points was given if patient
allocation was truly random, if assessment of vital
status was independent of treatment group, and if data
from all patients initially included were analysed
according to the intention to treat principle. Figure 2
shows that the three low quality studies (<7 points)
showed more benefit than the high quality trials.
Exclusion of these three studies, however, leaves the
overall effect and the confidence intervals practically
unchanged.
Thirdly, significant results are more likely to get
published than non-significant findings,
28 and this can
distort the findings of meta-analyses. The presence of
such publication bias can be identified by stratifying
the analysis by study size—smaller effects can be signifi-
cant in larger studies. If publication bias is present, it is
expected that, of published studies, the largest ones will
report the smallest effects. Figure 2 shows that this is
indeed the case, with the smallest trials (50 or fewer
deaths) showing the largest effect. However, exclusion
of the smallest studies has little effect on the overall
estimate.
Finally, two studies (J and N; see fig 1) were stopped
earlier than anticipated on the grounds of the results
from interim analyses. Estimates of treatment effects
from trials that were stopped early are liable to be
biased away from the null value. Bias may thus be
introduced in a meta-analysis that includes such trials.
29
Exclusion of these trials, however, affects the overall
estimate only marginally.
The sensitivity analysis thus shows that the results
from this meta-analysis are robust to the choice of the
statistical method and to the exclusion of trials of
poorer quality or of studies stopped early. It also
suggests that publication bias is unlikely to have
distorted its findings.

Conclusions
Meta-analysis
should
be
seen
as
structuring
the
processes
through
which
a
thorough
review
of
previous
research
is
carried
out.
The
issues
of
completeness and combinability of evidence, which
need to be considered in any review,
30 are made
explicit.
Was
it
sensible
to
have
combined
the
individual trials that comprise the meta-analysis? How
robust is the result to changes in assumptions? Does
the conclusion reached make clinical and pathophysio-
logical sense? Finally, has the analysis contributed to
the process of making rational decisions about the
management of patients? It is these issues that we
explore further in later articles in this series.

Words to the wise
Turning and turning in the widening gyre
Cerebral gyri and nasal turbinates do not, at first, appear to have
much in common, but both derive their names from turning
words.
The scroll shaped edge of a turbinate bone recalls the spiral
structure of a turbinate seashell, which in turn resembles a
Roman spinning top, turbo. This word was also used for a
whirlwind, explaining the connection to turbine. The rotary chaos
of the whirlwind also explains the Latin turba, a disorderly crowd,
which gives us turbulent and turbid, as well as perturb and disturb.
The cerebral gyri are named for their curved shape: gyrus is
Latin for a circle or ring, and gives us our word gyrate. In 1617
Italian citizens were introduced to the edible root of a recently
imported North American sunflower. The taste was a little
reminiscent of an artichoke, and so they named the plant the
“sunflower artichoke.” The Italian word for sunflower is girasole,
“turn to the sun,” and English speakers picked up this word and
ran with it, albeit in the wrong direction, so that we now call the
same plant a Jerusalem artichoke. A couple of hundred years later,
in a neighbouring country, Léon Foucault built a large flywheel as
a successor to his famous pendulum. When spinning, it
maintained its orientation as the earth turned beneath it. So he
called it a gyroscope, because he could see the earth’s rotation if he
watched for long enough.
Latin vertere, to turn, produces a crop of handy words.Turning
the plough at the end of the field gave the Romans versus, a
furrow, a word they also applied to a line of text. Our own word
verse comes from this source. Vertex, vortex, and vertigo all derive
from the notion of turning around an axis. Watching the sky pass
overhead each night inspired the idea of the universe, which
apparently rotated as a unit. And it is nowadays worth
considering that university has the same derivation: originally a
group of people with one purpose, who behaved as a single entity.
From Latin, too, comes torquere, to twist, which gives us torque
and also torch, from the twisted straw that was burnt for
illumination. Torticollis is, of course, a twisted neck, while extortion,
torture, and torment derive their names from the twisting of limbs.
Retort signifies “twisting back,” either of the spoken word or of the
neck of a piece of glassware. The legal term tort uses twistedness
as a metaphor for wrongness; in this case, the wrong caused by a
failure of duty. But long before this legalism came into use
non-Latin speakers had made precisely the same metaphorical
linkage: our English words wring and wrong can be traced to a
common root in the Germanic tongues of ancient northern
Europe.
