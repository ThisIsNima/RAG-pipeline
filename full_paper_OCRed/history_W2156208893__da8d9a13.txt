1. Early Pleistocene pCO2 roughly varied with obliquity cycles. 
2. Interglacial pCO2 was similar in the early and late Pleistocene; glacial pCO2 declined 
over the mid-Pleistocene transition. 
3. Discrepancies between δ11B values and corresponding pCO2 estimates from G. ruber 
and T. sacculifer are observed and may indicate evolving vital effects.

Abstract 
In the early Pleistocene, global temperature cycles predominantly varied with ~41-kyr (obliquity-
scale) periodicity. Atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations likely played a role in these 
climate cycles; marine sediments provide an indirect geochemical means to estimate early 
Pleistocene CO2. Here we present a boron isotope-based record of continuous high-resolution 
surface ocean pH and inferred atmospheric CO2 changes. Our results show that, within a window 
of time in the early Pleistocene (1.38-1.54 Ma), pCO2 varied with obliquity, confirming that, 
analogous to late Pleistocene conditions, the carbon cycle and climate co-varied at ~1.5 Ma. 
Pairing the reconstructed early Pleistocene pCO2 amplitude (92 ±13 µatm) with a comparably 
smaller global surface temperature glacial/interglacial amplitude (3.0 ±0.5 K), yields a surface 
temperature change to CO2 radiative forcing ratio of S[CO2]~0.75 (±0.5) ºC/Wm-2, as compared to 
the late Pleistocene S[CO2] value of ~1.75 (±0.6) ºC/Wm-2. This direct comparison of pCO2 and 
temperature implicitly incorporates the large ice sheet forcing as an internal feedback and is not 
directly applicable to future warming. We evaluate this result with a simple climate model, and 
show that the presumably thinner, though extensive, northern hemisphere ice sheets would 
increase surface temperature sensitivity to radiative forcing. Thus, the mechanism to dampen 
actual temperature variability in the early Pleistocene more likely lies with Southern Ocean 
circulation dynamics or antiphase hemispheric forcing. We also compile this new carbon dioxide 
record with published Plio-Pleistocene δ11B records using consistent boundary conditions and 
explore potential reasons for the discrepancy between Pliocene pCO2 based on different planktic 
foraminifera.  
 
1. Introduction 
The Pleistocene Epoch was characterized by a sequence of glacial/interglacial climate 
oscillations that are recorded in geochemical records from deep-sea sediments, continental 
deposits, and ice cores [e.g., Imbrie et al., 1984; Lüthi et al., 2008; Joannin et al., 2010]. These 
records show that Earth’s surface temperature covaried with the dominant periodicities of Earth’s

orbit around the Sun: orbital precession, obliquity and/or eccentricity. Nevertheless, 
understanding how the climate system responds to and amplifies the initial orbital insolation 
forcing is a long-standing problem in the field of paleoclimatology [Hays et al., 1976; Hansen et 
al., 1984; Imbrie et al., 1992; Hansen et al., 2005]. High-resolution records of temperature and 
greenhouse gas concentrations are of paramount value to elucidate the pattern and drivers of 
global climate change, yet continuous high-resolution ice core records of trapped ancient air are 
thus far restricted to the late Pleistocene (0.8 Ma to present) [e.g., Lüthi et al., 2008]. Ancient air 
inclusions in late Pleistocene ice-cores suggest that the partial pressure of atmospheric CO2 
(pCO2) lagged an initial temperature perturbation [Fischer et al., 2010] such that radiative 
greenhouse gas forcing at most amplified the orbital pacing of Pleistocene climate, via carbon 
cycle feedbacks, deep-sea carbon storage and release, and radiative forcing [Anderson et al., 
2009; Shakun et al., 2012]. During the early Pleistocene (2.6-1.0 Ma), obliquity set the dominant 
tempo of climate, and cold glacial intervals were shorter and less extreme [e.g., Lisiecki and 
Raymo, 2005; Huybers, 2007]. The presence of North American glacial tills indicates that early 
Pleistocene ice sheets at glacial maxima extended as far south as 39ºN [Roy et al., 2004; Balco 
and Rovey, 2010].  
 
In the early Pleistocene, both tropical [e.g., Herbert et al., 2010] and extratropical [e.g., 
Lawrence et al., 2009; Martínez-Garcia et al., 2010] sea-surface temperature (SST) records 
reveal long-term cooling in both glacial and interglacial intervals (i.e., 2 K cooler in tropics and 
3-4 K cooler in high latitudes). At the same time, the glacial-interglacial amplitude of surface 
temperature increased from ~3 K to ~5 K from the early to late Pleistocene, as glacial 
temperatures cooled [Lawrence et al., 2009; Herbert et al., 2010; Martínez-Garcia et al., 2010]. 
The gradual cooling of the early Pleistocene glacials culminated in the mid-Pleistocene transition 
(MPT) when surface temperature and benthic δ18O records shifted from a dominant 41-kyr 
periodicity to ~100-kyr pacing, albeit without an obvious corresponding change in the 
periodicity of incoming solar radiation [Ruddiman et al., 1989; Clark et al., 2006]. Mechanisms

put forward to explain this shift in climate response at the MPT include the exposure of 
crystalline bedrock and thus a more solid foundation for the Laurentide ice sheet [e.g. Clark and 
Pollard, 1998], changing ocean dynamics that provide increased precipitation available to build 
larger northern hemisphere ice sheets [Tziperman and Gildor, 2003; McClymont et al., 2008], or 
the consequence of long-term cooling and glacial CO2 drawdown as a result of iron fertilization 
and/or reduced ocean ventilation which sequestered more carbon in the deep ocean [Köhler and 
Bintanja, 2008; Hönisch et al., 2009; Chalk et al., 2017]. Filling in the early Pleistocene pCO2 
data gaps with orbitally-resolved records will help to evaluate these hypotheses. 
 
While efforts to extend the continuous ice-core pCO2 record to the early Pleistocene are being 
actively pursued [Fischer et al., 2013; Higgins et al., 2015; Witze, 2015; Bibby et al., 2016], such 
records are not yet available. However, marine sediments provide an opportunity to estimate 
pCO2 changes from earlier and warmer periods of Earth history. One leading method for 
estimating atmospheric pCO2 from marine sediments is via the boron isotope ratio (δ11B) 
recorded in the shells of planktic foraminifera. Shell δ11B is primarily controlled by seawater 
acidity (i.e., pH). CO2 exchanges between the atmosphere and the surface ocean depend on the 
partial pressure in each medium after Henry’s law. Higher atmospheric pCO2 results in more 
CO2 dissolved in seawater and thereby lowers surface ocean pH. The pH dependency of the 
relative abundance and isotopic signature of the two main species of boron in seawater (borate 
ion and boric acid) permits the δ11B value of marine carbonates to reflect such changes in ocean 
pH (see Methods). Several studies have validated this proxy relative to ice core pCO2 in the late 
Pleistocene [Hönisch and Hemming, 2005; Henehan et al., 2013; Chalk et al., 2017] and 
presented estimates of pCO2 throughout portions of the Pliocene and Pleistocene [Hönisch et al., 
2009; Bartoli et al., 2011; Henehan et al., 2013; Martínez-Botí et al., 2015a; Chalk et al., 2017]. 
Here we present estimates of pCO2 based on new δ11B measurements in planktic foraminifera 
shells within a time window spanning Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 44-52 (1.38-1.54 Ma).

Published estimates of early Pleistocene pCO2 are as high as 410 (±50) µatm as recorded at ODP 
Site 999 at 2.37 Ma [Martínez-Botí et al., 2015a] and as low as 167 (±19) µatm at 0.65 Ma 
[Hönisch et al., 2009]. Bartoli et al. [2011] observed that atmospheric pCO2 decreased in a step-
wise fashion at ~ 2.7 Ma, although that particular study did not measure a temperature proxy 
alongside each of the boron isotope analyses, and used modeled estimates of the carbonate ion 
concentration, [CO3
2-], as the second parameter of the carbonate system to translate pH into 
reconstructed pCO2. Here we present new high-resolution data from ODP 668B in the eastern 
tropical Atlantic, revise the dataset of Bartoli et al. [2011] with new temperature and 
geochemical constraints, and compile these records in a consistent manner with other published 
datasets of early Pleistocene pCO2. By minimizing the differences in the way boundary 
conditions are treated among these records, we are able to compare the combined δ11B and pCO2 
records and to describe coherent features of the pCO2 decline from the late Pliocene through the 
Pleistocene.  
 
2. Materials and Methods  
The primary materials for this study come from ODP Site 668B in the eastern tropical Atlantic 
(4.77ºN, 20.93ºW, water depth 2693 m, average sedimentation rate 1.5 cm/kyr, Figure 1). The 
modern surface ocean at this location is near equilibrium with the atmosphere with respect to 
CO2 [Takahashi et al., 2009], and previously published late Pleistocene boron isotope data from 
this site show good agreement with ice core pCO2 over the past 0.8 Ma [Hönisch and Hemming, 
2005; Hönisch et al., 2009], making this a promising location for extending the reconstruction of 
paleo-pCO2. Sediment samples were taken from core 668B every 5 cm (3.3 kyr) and were 
selected to include glacial and interglacial extrema in planktic δ18O [Hönisch et al., 2009]. 
Samples were washed and picked for the planktic foraminiferal species Globigerinoides ruber 
(300-355 µm size fraction) and Trilobatus (formerly Globigerinoides) sacculifer (>500 µm size 
fraction), which both live in the surface mixed layer [Spero et al., 2003].

2.1 δ11B-based pCO2 estimates  
Tests of T. sacculifer from the >500 µm size fraction have been validated to reflect surface ocean 
conditions for pH and pCO2 estimates [Hönisch and Hemming, 2004; 2005; Hönisch et al., 
2009]. Although partial dissolution has the potential to lower foraminiferal δ11B in corrosive 
bottom water, this effect is more pronounced in smaller foraminiferal test size classes [Hönisch 
and Hemming, 2004; Edgar et al., 2015]. The samples in this study come from the largest size 
fraction and from relatively shallow (2693 modern m depth) waters that are oversaturated with 
respect to calcite (Ωcalcite = 1.5, ∆[CO3
2-] ~35 µmol/kg). This depth is well above the regional 
lysocline and partial dissolution is unlikely [Regenberg et al., 2006]. For each δ11B sample, ~30-
50 T. sacculifer shells were picked, gently crushed and cleaned by repeated sonication in MilliQ 
water and methanol, oxidation in a buffered H2O2 solution to remove organic material, and a 
final weak acid leach [Barker et al., 2003]. Cleaned material was rinsed in MilliQ water, dried to 
determine the calcite mass after cleaning, and finally dissolved in 2N hydrochloric acid just 
before analysis. All δ11B samples were measured at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory 
using a TRITON thermal ionization mass spectrometer in negative mode (N-TIMS). Aliquots of 
the sample solution containing ≥1 ng boron were loaded onto outgassed zone-refined rhenium 
filaments, along with 1 µl of boron-free seawater to enhance ionization (see Hönisch et al. 
[2009] for details). Although analysis of boron isotopes in marine carbonates by the N-TIMS 
method yields ~1‰ higher δ11B values compared to the alternative MC-ICP-MS technique, the 
relative variability between different samples is similar between the two methods and yield 
equivalent pH and pCO2 results when technique-specific δ11Bforaminifera vs. δ11Bborate calibrations 
are applied [Foster et al., 2013; Farmer et al., 2016]. To minimize analytical uncertainty, each 
sample analysis was replicated 3-10 (average of 7) times. Of those replicates, individual analyses 
were rejected if excessive fractionation (δ11B >1‰) occurred over the 40 minutes of data 
acquisition; 14% of analyses were rejected on this basis. The majority of samples yielded 5 or 
more replicates that met the acceptance criteria. Only one sample, at 1.436 Ma, could not be

replicated due to low abundance of T. sacculifer shells. Uncertainty in the δ11B measurement was 
determined as the larger of either: (1) the standard error in valid replicate analyses (i.e., 2σ = 
2*standard deviation / √N, where N is the number of accepted replicates) or (2) the 2σ 
uncertainty of an equal number of repeat measurements of an in-house standard of NIST 951 
precipitated in CaCO3 matrix (vaterite). Average 2σ uncertainty of all δ11B measurements is 
±0.26‰. 
 
The relative abundance of the two aqueous species of boron in seawater, borate ion (B(OH)4
-) 
and boric acid (B(OH)3), is pH dependent [Dickson, 1990; Hemming and Hanson, 1992]. The 
isotopic fractionation between 11B (natural abundance ~80%) and 10B (~20%) generates a 
constant δ11B offset between these two aqueous boron species, such that δ11B of borate increases 
with the relative abundance of borate at higher pH. Since the borate ion is the primary species 
incorporated into foraminiferal calcite [e.g., Hemming and Hanson, 1992; Branson et al., 2015], 
in-situ seawater pH can be estimated from the δ11B of foraminiferal calcite. The boron isotopic 
composition of seawater (δ11Bsw) must also be known; in the modern ocean δ11Bsw is 39.61 
(±0.04)‰ [Foster et al., 2010]. While this value likely increased over the Cenozoic through 
shifts in weathering and/or volcanic emissions [Lemarchand et al., 2000], attempts to reconstruct 
δ11Bsw over the past 5 million years have yielded disparate results. The combined evidence, 
whether from benthic foraminiferal δ11B alongside modeled ocean pH [Raitzsch and Hönisch, 
2013] or paired δ11B measurements in the water column coupled with assumptions about water 
column pH gradient [Pearson and Palmer, 2000; Greenop et al., 2017], shows no clear 
indication of a trend in  δ11Bsw over the past 5 Ma (Figure S1). As the residence time of boron in 
seawater is long (11-17 My), the maximum rate of change over this time period is likely <0.1‰ 
per million years [Lemarchand et al., 2000]; hence, we apply the modern δ11Bsw value (39.61‰) 
to all Plio-Pleistocene samples and increase the uncertainty of this assumed value at a constant 
rate of 0.1‰/Myr (Figure S1). Ocean pH is then determined via:

pH = pK*
B – log[-(δ11Bsw - δ11Bborate) / {δ11Bsw – (11-10KB * δ11Bborate) – 1000 * (11-10KB – 
1)}]  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Eq. 1) 
 
where pK*
B is the dissociation constant for boric acid at in situ temperature, salinity and pressure 
[Dickson, 1990; Millero, 1995], and the aqueous boron isotope fractionation factor is 11-10KB= 
1.0272 (±0.0006) [Klochko et al., 2006]. Application of the boron isotope proxy also requires an 
understanding of any physiological or vital effects on the pH of the foraminiferal 
microenvironment, which have been documented for a variety of species. Here we use a 
calibration specifically established for T. sacculifer, which includes culture and core top 
sediment samples of T. sacculifer measured via N-TIMS at LDEO and Stony Brook [Sanyal et 
al., 2001; Hönisch and Hemming, 2004; 2005; Hönisch et al., 2009]. Values measured at Stony 
Brook have been cross-calibrated with N-TIMS [Hönisch et al., 2009] and a constant offset of -
1.1‰ has been applied to all data measured in Stony Brook to shift them onto data measured on 
the N-TIMS at LDEO. A linear York fit [York et al., 2004] calculated for laboratory cultured 
specimens grown across a range of pH values includes uncertainties in the δ11Bcalcite 
measurement and the δ11Bborate calculation for experimental seawater. This regression is then 
adjusted by a constant intercept offset of -0.84‰ so as to pass through the average of core top T. 
sacculifer δ11Bcalcite data and the corresponding preindustrial δ11Bborate (Figure 2 and Table S1). 
The offset accounts for the difference between cultured and sedimentary specimens, which is 
likely due to the gametogenic calcite crust that T. sacculifer secretes at greater water depths in 
the ocean [Bé, 1980]. The resulting calibration for T. sacculifer in the >500 µm size fraction 
(measured on N-TIMS), including 2σ uncertainty, is:  
 
δ11Bborate = [δ11BT. sacculifer N-TIMS – 6.42 (±1.64)] / 0.73 (±0.08) 
 
(Eq. 2)

In comparison, the published calibration for T. sacculifer using the MC-ICP-MS technique 
[Martínez-Botí et al., 2015b] is:  
 
δ11Bborate = [δ11BT. sacculifer MC-ICP-MS – 3.60 (±0.72)] / 0.83 (±0.04) 
 
(Eq. 3) 
 
While the slope of the MC-ICP-MS δ11Bborate calibration is steeper (0.83 vs. 0.73), the additional 
culture data points in our N-TIMS calibration (5 instead of 3) allow for a more precise 
calibration. The primary difference between these technique-specific calibrations is the intercept 
value, which is the most important factor in aligning pH estimates from N-TIMS and MC-ICP-
MS δ11B analyses [Foster et al., 2013]. 
 
2.2 Temperature, salinity, and pressure estimates  
Here we present new Mg/Ca-based estimates of SST using G. ruber from Site 668B and T. 
sacculifer from Site 999A. Due to the limited availability of large T. sacculifer tests from Site 
668B, tests of G. ruber (sensu stricto, white) were used to estimate surface ocean temperature for 
this site. Globigerinoides ruber shares the near-surface ocean habitat of large T. sacculifer 
specimens [Ravelo and Fairbanks, 1992; Spero et al., 2003; Farmer et al., 2007]. For Site 668B, 
40-60 G. ruber tests were picked from the 300-355 µm size fraction. For Site 999A, 40 shells of 
T. sacculifer were picked from the 425-500 µm size fraction, the same species and size fraction 
of planktic foraminifera as the original δ11B data [Bartoli et al., 2011]. Shells were then gently 
broken and cleaned following established protocol including both the oxidative and reductive 
steps [Boyle and Keigwin, 1985; Mashiotta et al., 1999]. Inclusion of the reductive step is 
generally preferred for Mg/Ca analysis as it is more effective at removing high-Mg contaminants 
such as authigenic metals precipitated after deposition in the sediment, even though it has been 
shown to lower Mg/Ca values beyond their original value [Martin and Lea, 2002; Weldeab et al., 
2006]. Because the Mg/Ca-temperature calibration we use [Anand et al., 2003] is based on 
sediment trap samples and therefore did not apply reductive cleaning, we account for reductive

cleaning bias by adding 10% to the measured Mg/Ca ratio of our samples [Martin and Lea, 
2002]. Mg/Ca ratios were measured via ICP-MS (iCAP-Q) at the Lamont-Doherty Earth 
Observatory. The 2σ standard error for repeated measurements of internal foraminifer reference 
standards is ±2.2%, or ~±0.08 mmol/mol. This SST calibration carries a larger uncertainty (±2.4 
K, 2σ) than that of the Mg/Ca measurement uncertainty (~±0.24 K) and we adopt the larger 
calibration uncertainty for seawater temperature estimates. As our samples are derived from a 
time period when the Mg/Ca value of seawater (Mg/Casw) was likely lower than the modern 
value of 5.2 mmol/mol, a correction is needed for this change in seawater constituents [Delaney 
et al., 1985; Fantle and DePaolo, 2005; 2006; Medina-Elizalde et al., 2008; O’Brien et al., 2014; 
Evans et al., 2016]. To facilitate this correction, Mg/Casw values are taken from reported pore 
fluid chemistry and numerical modeling [Figure S7, Fantle and DePaolo, 2006]. This Mg/Casw 
dataset is within the uncertainty of Mg/Casw values estimated from fluid inclusions in marine 
evaporites, the most recent of which is Messinian in age (5-6 Ma, Mg/Casw ~ 3.6 mmol/mol) 
[Horita et al., 2002; Brennan et al., 2013]. If data from marine evaporite fluid inclusions were 
considered alone, and Mg/Casw values are linearly extrapolated from 5.5 Ma to present, the 
resulting SST would be ~0.7 K lower and calculated pCO2 would be ~5 µatm higher. The SST 
calibration we use includes the power-law modification suggested by Evans and Müller [2012] 
and the T. sacculifer exponential H-value of 0.41 [Delaney et al., 1985; Evans and Müller, 
2012]:  
 
SST (ºC) = ln[((Mg/Ca)calcite * ((Mg/Ca)sw
t=0)H) / (0.38 * ((Mg/Ca)sw
t)H)] / 0.09 
(Eq. 4) 
 
where (Mg/Ca)t
sw is the Mg/Ca ratio of seawater at time t. This approach is commonly used to 
reconstruct temperature in this time period [e.g., Martínez-Botí et al., 2015a; Chalk et al., 2017]. 
The correction for dissolution with depth [Dekens et al., 2002] is omitted for all records in this 
study, as all study sites are well above the regional tropical Atlantic lysocline (4200 m water 
depth), and bottom water is saturated with respect to calcium carbonate [Key et al., 2004;

11 
Regenberg et al., 2006]. Hönisch et al. [2013] have demonstrated that adjusting Mg/Ca data from 
sediments above the lysocline effectively overestimates actual calcification temperatures.  
 
Pleistocene salinity was calculated as a function of relative mean sea level (RMSL) as 
determined via a numerical ice-ocean model [Bintanja and van de Wal, 2008]. The change in 
local salinity is approximately proportional to the change in global average salinity due to 
glacial-interglacial sea level change. The equation used is 
 
Salinity668B = 35.8‰ + RMSL / 3800 m * 34.8‰ 
 
 
 
(Eq. 5) 
 
where 35.8‰ is the modern salinity of the mixed layer (50 m water depth) at Site 668B [Zweng 
et al., 2013], 3800 m is the average depth of the ocean and 34.8‰ is the average salinity of the 
modern ocean. These estimates agree (within uncertainty) with local salinity estimates derived 
from using Mg/Ca-based SST and calcite δ18O to estimate the δ18O of seawater (δ18Osw, Figure 
3) [Bemis et al., 1998; Legrande and Schmidt, 2006]. 
 
In situ seawater pressure is also required and is a function of the foraminiferal calcification 
depth. Here we assume a calcification depth for both G. ruber and T. sacculifer of 50 m 
[Schiebel and Hemleben, 2005; Farmer et al., 2007] and a corresponding seawater pressure of 50 
decibars. The pressure effect on equilibrium constants is small; an uncertainty of ±50 m water 
depth results in an uncertainty in calculated pH of ±0.002 and pCO2 of ±1 µatm. 
 
2.3 Alkalinity estimates  
In order to calculate the partial pressure of CO2 in seawater, a second variable of the ocean 
carbonate system is required [e.g., Zeebe and Wolf-Gladrow, 2001]. Here, alkalinity is estimated 
from the modern local alkalinity-to-salinity relationship following the ‘constant alkalinity’ 
scenario of previous studies, which assumes that total alkalinity in the ocean remained constant

12 
in the past [Hönisch and Hemming, 2005; Hönisch et al., 2009]. The local alkalinity-to-salinity 
relationship was developed using WOCE and GLODAP databases [Schlitzer, 2000; Key et al., 
2004] covering the area 0-10ºN and 10-20ºW [Hönisch and Hemming, 2005; Hönisch et al., 
2009].  
 
Total Alkalinity668B = 65.62 * Salinity668B + 22.84 
 
 
 
(Eq. 6) 
 
Over long timescales (tens to hundreds of thousands of years) the local alkalinity-to-salinity 
relationship could deviate from the modern relationship as a function of the Canadian Shield 
silicate weathering contribution to global weathering rates, where increased weathering would 
have added alkalinity to the ocean [Clark et al., 2006]. Even though the relative contribution of 
such differential weathering is weakly constrained, the absolute impact on paleo-alkalinity is 
relatively small. Models show that varying the contribution of Canadian Shield weathering to the 
total ocean alkalinity budget of between 0 and 8% (Figure S2) only change the total ocean 
alkalinity in the Pleistocene by ~50 µmol/kg [Clark et al., 2006]. To account for the potential 
effect of differential weathering on the local alkalinity-to-salinity ratio for past time periods, we 
include an alkalinity uncertainty of ±100 µmol/kg for the past 1.8 Ma.  
 
2.4 Calculation of pCO2  
Aqueous CO2 (differentiated as PCO2) values are calculated from estimates of pH (total scale), 
alkalinity, salinity, temperature, and pressure using CO2SYS [version 2.3, Pierrot et al., 2006]. 
Within this program, we selected the recommended default values of pK1 and pK2 from Lueker et 
al. [2000], KHSO4 from Dickson [1990], KHF from Perez and Fraga [1987], and [B]T from Lee 
et al. [2010]. As described above, aqueous PCO2 at site 668B is in equilibrium with the 
atmosphere in the modern ocean [Takahashi et al., 2009] and comparison of boron isotope 
estimates with ice core records suggests it was also in equilibrium over the past 800 kyr [Hönisch 
and Hemming, 2005; Hönisch et al., 2009]. We therefore interpret our aqueous paleo-PCO2

estimates from Site 668B as equivalent to atmospheric paleo-pCO2. In order to directly compare 
with δ11B records from Site 999A, we translate δ11B-based aqueous PCO2 records from Site 999 
to atmospheric pCO2 by subtracting the annual average pre-industrial disequilibrium value (21 
µatm) as justified by Henehan et al. [2013] who accounted for the modern seasonal ∆pCO2 
difference and a small correction for pre-industrial PCO2 [Gloor et al., 2003; Takahashi et al., 
2009]. 
 
2.5 Uncertainty  
Uncertainty in the pH estimate is a function of the propagated 2σ uncertainties in the δ11B 
measurement on δ11Bborate, the uncertainty in δ11Bsw, and the effect of temperature and salinity 
uncertainties on the dissociation constants of boric and carbonic acid in seawater. We report 
uncertainty in pH as the root-mean-square error of the effect each parameter uncertainty has on 
pH: the δ11B measurement and δ11Bborate calibration (±0.03 pH units, ~80% coming from 
analytical uncertainty), the estimate of δ11Bsw (±0.01 pH units at 1.5 Ma), the temperature 
constraints (calibration uncertainty equates to ±0.02 pH units) and salinity (±0.01 pH units). 
Uncertainty is calculated on a sample-by-sample basis; average total pH uncertainty of the Site 
668B data is ±0.043 (2σ). Uncertainty in the pCO2 calculation is likewise a function of 
uncertainty in the overall input parameters: the δ11B measurement and calibration (±23 µatm), 
alkalinity (±12 µatm), and the effects of temperature (±19 µatm) and salinity (±3 µatm). 
Uncertainty in PCO2 is similarly calculated on a sample-by-sample basis; average total PCO2 
uncertainty is ±33 µatm (2σ) for the newly estimated PCO2 values at ~1.5 Ma. 
 
2.6 Chronology  
The age model for ODP Site 668B was initially constructed from microfossil occurrence data 
and estimates of the depths of geomagnetic reversals [Shipboard Scientific Party, 1988]. This 
initial chronology was later tuned through the alignment of glacial-interglacial cycles in the high-

resolution planktic (G. ruber) δ18O values of Site 668B [Bird and Cali, 1998; 2002; Hönisch et 
al., 2009] with the well-dated planktic δ18O values of ODP Site 677 [Shackleton et al., 1990] and 
the LR04 benthic δ18O stack [Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005]. In order to resolve planktic δ18O 
mismatches between Sites 668B and 677 during MIS 48-52 (1.45-1.53 ka), we used AnalySeries 
software [Paillard et al., 1996] to add tie points which refine the planktic δ18O alignment. All 
ages younger than 1.3 Ma (19 m core depth) are unchanged from the previously published age 
model [Hönisch et al., 2009]. The revised age model for the period prior to 1.3 Ma (core depths 
19-26 m) improves the planktic δ18O correlation coefficient (Pearson R2) between Sites 677 and 
668B from ~0.31 to ~0.40 and reconstructed ages are up to 15% younger than previously 
estimated (Figure S3). The updated age model also conforms to the original ODP geomagnetic 
constraints, which placed the top of the Olduvai reversal (1.78 Ma) at 2.725 m core depth 
[Shipboard Scientific Party, 1988], just beyond the oldest available δ18O values from Site 668B 
(Figure S3). Unfortunately, the age uncertainty of the underlying benthic δ18O stack is ±6 kyr in 
the early Pleistocene [Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005]; this age uncertainty prevents the determination 
of leads or lags that are shorter than this confidence interval. 
 
2.7 Comparison with other δ11B-based PCO2 records  
For comparison between this new record and other previously published Pleistocene δ11B-based 
PCO2 records, we compile PCO2 estimates from δ11B data from Site 668B and Site 999A in the 
tropical Atlantic. These two sites present a good comparison as ocean-atmosphere disequilibrium 
is small at both locations. In order to rule out methodological differences, we calculated PCO2 
from each published record using equivalent input parameters and technique-specific 
calibrations. The original Site 668B δ11BT. sacculifer data [Hönisch et al., 2009] are used to 
recalculate pH and PCO2 using the above methods (Section 2.1-2.6). The δ11B calibration for this 
dataset is updated (Eq. 2) and δ11Bsw is assumed to be 39.61‰ throughout. Temperature is

15 
calculated via the same Anand et al. [2003] calibration, after correcting for changes in seawater 
Mg/Ca (Eq. 4).  
 
The δ11BT. sacculifer data of ODP 999A [Bartoli et al., 2011] were also revised using similar 
methods described above.  To do so, we first generated new Mg/Ca data from the same or 
adjacent samples used for δ11B analysis (see section 2.2). In the original study, SST was 
interpolated from T. sacculifer Mg/Ca values [Groeneveld, 2005] with a different temporal 
resolution than the δ11B samples; our new temperature data reduce the interpolation of 
temperature estimates. Furthermore, the original SST record used the depth-based dissolution 
correction of Dekens et al. [2002], along with an outdated modern Mg/Casw value of 4.96 
mmol/mol. Due to omission of the depth correction, the SST estimated for this record is on 
average 1.8 K cooler than SST in the original publication (Figure S4) which places interglacial 
SST in agreement with modern SST at this location, whether taken from an annual average of 
modern direct measurements (27.7 ºC) [Locarnini et al., 2013] or estimated from core top Mg/Ca 
values (28.2 ºC) [Henehan et al., 2013]. Site 999A (water depth 2839 m) is situated well above 
the regional lysocline (4200 m) and T. sacculifer shells are not subject to preferential high-Mg 
calcite dissolution at this water depth [Regenberg et al., 2006]. Taken together, the omission of 
the depth correction thus appears well justified.  
 
Additionally, Bartoli et al. [2011] used modeled surface ocean [CO3
2-] estimates as the second 
parameter of the carbonate system and paired them with their δ11B-pH estimates and to calculate 
PCO2. Because pH and [CO3
2-] are closely related in carbonate equilibria, pairing them in carbon 
system calculations produces large variations in the calculated parameters. For instance, the pH 
and [CO3
2-] estimates of Bartoli et al. [2011] combine to yield glacial-interglacial total alkalinity 
variations of up ~800 µmol/kg (Figure S5). Such a large change in ocean alkalinity is unlikely 
over these timescales as alkalinity is stabilized by the distribution of calcium carbonate 
accumulation and dissolution (carbonate compensation) in the deep sea on scales of thousands of

16 
years [Broecker, 1971; Broecker and Peng, 1987; Boyle, 1988]. Extrapolating from LGM 
estimates of alkalinity and lysocline depth, an 800 µmol/kg decrease in alkalinity would 
correspond to a >2 km shallower lysocline, which is difficult to reconcile with observations of 
relatively small changes (<0.5 km) in lysocline depth over the Pleistocene [Farrell and Prell, 
1991]. Geochemical models also suggest smaller alkalinity adjustments, e.g. <400 µmol/kg over 
the past 10 million years [Figures 3d and 4d of Tyrrell and Zeebe, 2004] and <250 µmol/kg over 
the past 2.6 Ma [Clark et al., 2006]. We therefore revise the PCO2 record of Bartoli et al. [2011] 
by using estimates of total alkalinity as the second carbonate system parameter; pH, salinity, and 
temperature are calculated in the same manner as for Site 668B (Sections 2.2, 2.4). Here 
alkalinity is calculated via the same regional relationship with salinity that was previously 
established for Site 999A [Foster, 2008]. 
 
Total Alkalinity999A = 59.19 * Salinity999A + 229.08  
 
 
(Eq. 7) 
 
To account for the potential impact of differential weathering on the local alkalinity-to-salinity 
ratio for these older samples, we increase the alkalinity uncertainty to ±175 µmol/kg for all 
samples older than 1.8 Ma. Older time periods (> ~2 Ma are less well constrained and so larger 
uncertainty estimates are used. In contrast to Chalk et al. [2017] who used constant alkalinity and 
therefore assumed the larger 175 µmol/kg uncertainty throughout, our uncertainty estimates are 
superimposed on the alkalinity changes based on sea level, and are therefore even more 
conservative than those use by Chalk et al. [2017]. 
 
Published boron isotope data are also available from G. ruber from Site 999A [Foster, 2008; 
Seki et al., 2010; Henehan et al., 2013; Martínez-Botí et al., 2015a; Chalk et al., 2017]. Boron-
based PCO2 reconstructions from both T. sacculifer and G. ruber have been extensively 
calibrated and both species provide convincing PCO2 estimates compared to ice core records. 
Here we apply minor revisions to the published δ11BG. ruber-based PCO2 calculations (namely,

using a common SST calibration and assuming a constant δ11Bsw over the past 5 Ma) with the 
goal of ensuring compatible comparisons among the results. All the published δ11BG. ruber values 
are translated to δ11Bborate using the established species- and instrument-specific calibration of 
Henehan et al. [2013]: 
 
δ11Bborate = [δ11BG. ruber MC-ICP-MS – 8.87 (±1.52)] / 0.60 (±0.09) 
 
(Eq. 8) 
 
In each case G. ruber specimens are from the 300-355 µm size fraction so any additional offset 
for size fraction is not required [Henehan et al., 2013].  
 
The other parameters needed (temperature, salinity, δ11Bsw, and alkalinity) are estimated 
consistently with Sections 2.1-2.6. In situ temperature is determined from Mg/Ca values as 
described by equation 4, except for the record of Seki et al. [2010] in which the alkenone 
unsaturation index is used for temperature reconstruction as in the original publication; alkenone-
based temperatures are indistinguishable from Mg/Ca-based SST at this location. In all cases 
salinity is assessed from the modeled sea level estimates of Bintanja and van de Wal [2008], 
similar to equation 5, with modern salinity of the mixed layer (50 m water depth) at Site 999A of 
36.2‰.  
 
Salinity999A = 36.2‰ + RMSL / 3800 m * 34.8‰ 
 
 
 
(Eq. 9) 
 
For samples older than 3 Ma, the limit of the RMSL data set [Bintanja and van de Wal, 2008], 
the oldest value (St=3.0 Ma = 36.2‰) is used. An alternate method for calculating salinity used by 
previous publications is via the δ18O and Mg/Ca values of planktic calcite to find local δ18Osw 
and then translate δ18Osw to a salinity estimate. In practice, this method would result in average 
salinity ~0.4 lower than estimated above (Eq. 9), pH ~0.0002 lower, and PCO2 ~1 µatm higher. 
Equations for this alternative salinity estimate can be found in the supplemental material.

3. Results  
The ODP Site 668B boron-based PCO2 record for the interval 1.38-1.54 Ma is presented in 
Figure 3. Within this time period δ11BT. sacculifer values range between a maximum of 22.19 
(±0.21)‰ (1.502 Ma) and a minimum of 20.26 (±0.25)‰ (1.402 Ma) with an average δ11B value 
of 21.14 (±0.16)‰. Calculated PCO2 ranges between 183 (±21) µatm (at 1.502 Ma) and 327 
(±61) µatm (at 1.408 Ma) with an average PCO2 value of 258 (±29) µatm. The average 
amplitude of minimum glacial to maximum interglacial PCO2 is 92 (±34) µatm (average of 4 
interglacial maxima (304 (±46) µatm) minus average of 5 glacial minima (212 (±23) µatm); 
these uncertainties are based on the average uncertainty of the data points in question)). 
 
The measured δ11BT. sacculifer value is the dominating parameter for the calculated PCO2 record 
(Figure S6). To evaluate the respective effects of temperature, alkalinity, and salinity on the 
calculated PCO2, we performed a simple sensitivity study in which δ11B was held constant at the 
average value (21.15‰) while all other factors (temperature, alkalinity, salinity) varied as 
evaluated previously. When δ11BT. sacculifer is held constant, the secondary driver of the PCO2 
calculation is local SST, although even the full range of local SST (3.1 K) can only account for a 
maximum glacial-interglacial PCO2 range of 24 µatm (Figure S6). Thus, the calculation of paleo-
PCO2 is driven primarily by changes in surface ocean pH as reflected in the raw δ11B data; 
temperature, salinity, and alkalinity exert only a minor additional influence on the pH and PCO2 
estimates. This is in contrast to the potentially dominant effects other environmental parameters 
(i.e. [B(OH)4
-], [HCO3
-]) can have on B/Ca-based estimates of carbonate parameters [Tripati et 
al., 2011; Allen et al., 2012]. 
 
Published records of δ11B-based PCO2 were revised to be consistent with the given methodology 
above. Each parameter revision was tested individually to determine which parameter caused the

greatest resulting PCO2 shift from the original publication. In each instance, T. sacculifer δ11B 
has been measured via N-TIMS and G. ruber δ11B via MC-ICP-MS. For the longer (0-1.8 Ma) 
Site 668B T. sacculifer dataset, average PCO2 is +2 µatm higher than the published record 
[Hönisch et al., 2009]. This difference is composed of the assumption that δ11Bsw was 39.61‰ 
rather than 39.5‰ (+6 µatm), the updated δ11Bborate calibration (Eq. 2, -16 µatm), updated SST 
calibration (Eq. 4, +3 µatm), and alkalinity calculated via the ‘constant alkalinity scenario’ (Eq. 
6, +14 µatm). For Site 999A (0-26 ka), average PCO2 is also +12 µatm higher than the published 
record [Henehan et al., 2013], primarily due to the revised salinity and alkalinity estimations 
(Eq. 7 and 9). For Site 999A (0-1.24 Ma), average PCO2 is +12 µatm higher than the published 
record [Chalk et al., 2017] also due to the revised salinity and alkalinity estimates. For the Site 
999A study of Seki et al. [2010] (0-2.6 Ma), the revised average PCO2 is +26 µatm higher than 
the published record [Seki et al., 2010], due to the updated calibration for the boron isotope 
proxy in G. ruber [Henehan et al., 2013]. For the Plio-Pleistocene (2.3-3.3 Ma) Site 999A G. 
ruber dataset, average PCO2 is +12 µatm higher than the published record [Martínez-Botí et al., 
2015b], primarily due to the revised assumption that seawater δ11Bsw was constant at 39.61‰ 
over the past 5 Ma (Figure S1), whereas the original publication assumed a lower δ11Bsw 
(~39.2‰) at the Plio-Pleistocene transition. 
 
For the Plio-Pleistocene (1.97-4.6 Ma) Site 999A T. sacculifer dataset, average PCO2 is 41 µatm 
lower than the published record [Bartoli et al., 2011], primarily due to the revised SST record 
which omits the depth-based dissolution correction (Eq. 4, SST 1.8 K cooler, -15 µatm) and the 
application of the pre-industrial disequilibrium value at this site (-21 µatm). The choice of 
alkalinity, rather than [CO3
2-] as the second parameter of the carbonate system, reduces the 
glacial-interglacial PCO2 amplitude of this record by 25% compared to the original publication 
(Figure S5). This finding highlights the volatile nature of the pH and [CO3
2-] pair in constraining 
the carbonate system, i.e., a small uncertainty in [CO3
2-] translates into a large shift in PCO2

when paired with pH. The amplitude reduction is a result of both reducing the interglacial PCO2 
estimates and increasing the glacial PCO2 estimates compared to the original record. All 
revisions were applied for consistency among calculations; the average PCO2 change in all cases 
is smaller than the average 2σ uncertainty reported in the original studies.  
 
4. Discussion 
Given that late Pleistocene pCO2 levels were closely correlated with both tropical SST [e.g., Lea, 
2004; Herbert et al., 2010; Dyez and Ravelo, 2013] and high latitude surface temperatures [Petit 
et al., 1999; Jouzel et al., 2007], an equivalent relationship could be expected for early 
Pleistocene glacial-interglacial cycles. Here we add to the growing body of data evidence that a 
similar first-order relationship between global average temperature and pCO2 also existed in the 
early Pleistocene, specifically in the interval 1.38-1.54 Ma (Figure 4). During interglacial periods 
δ11B was lower (i.e., lower surface ocean pH and higher atmospheric pCO2) and during glacial 
periods δ11B was higher (i.e., higher surface ocean pH and lower atmospheric pCO2), in line with 
similar findings for the late Pleistocene period [Hönisch and Hemming, 2005; Henehan et al., 
2013; Chalk et al., 2017]. To verify that our data are directly related to variation in atmospheric 
pCO2, we need to evaluate a range of processes that could have biased our geochemical signals 
and interpretations. 
 
First of all, ocean upwelling brings cooler and more CO2-rich water to the surface; if upwelling 
had increased during glacial intervals at this location, we would expect to observe a larger 
glacial-interglacial SST amplitude than other open-ocean sites; if upwelling had increased during 
interglacial intervals, we would expect a smaller SST amplitude. The local temperature 
amplitude we measure from Mg/Ca values (i.e., average of 4 interglacial SST maxima minus 
average of 5 glacial SST minima) is 1.4 (±0.3) K, equivalent to other early Pleistocene tropical 
SST records, whether derived from the south China Sea [Site 1146; 1.4 K, Herbert et al., 2010], 
the western Pacific [Site 806; 1.2 K, Medina-Elizalde and Lea, 2005; Site 871; 1.2 K, Dyez and

21 
Ravelo, 2014], the south Pacific [MD06-3018; 1.3K, Russon et al., 2010], the tropical Atlantic 
[Site 662; 1.6 K, Herbert et al., 2010], or the Arabian Sea [Site 722; 1.1 K, Herbert et al., 2010]. 
The similarity of the SST amplitude at Site 668B to other tropical records implies that glacial-
interglacial upwelling changes at this site were not substantial and did not preferentially 
influence either glacial or interglacial δ11B values.  
 
Secondly, shell diagenesis can occur after shells have been deposited on the ocean floor, 
potentially biasing our paleoenvironmental interpretations. However, in section 2 we already 
reasoned against potential dissolution at the sediment surface based on the shallow depth of the 
core tops and the much deeper Atlantic lysocline. Furthermore, the calcite saturation state of 
bottom water at this site is ΩCaCO3 = 1.5 and bottom water ∆[CO3
2-] = 34.5, both of which are 
higher than any site previously used for δ11B-based pCO2 estimates and above the range 
suggested for the onset of partial dissolution [de Villiers 2005; Dai et al., 2016].  If diagenesis 
lowered δ11B values within the buried sediment, we would expect to also observe lower shell 
weights and higher planktic δ18O and δ13C values [e.g., Edgar et al., 2015]. We examined the 
correlations among these values and do not find any significant relationships to support the 
notion that diagenesis has occurred within the sediment column. Taken together with the 
expected range of glacial-interglacial SST presented above, we can reasonably infer that the 
δ11B-based PCO2 signal we measure is primary and has not been biased by incomplete 
preservation. 
 
4.1 Early Pleistocene pCO2 varied with obliquity-related climate cycles 
To examine the glacial-interglacial linkages between pCO2, temperature, and orbital climate 
parameters from the period 1.38-1.54 Ma, we created cross-plots of reconstructed pCO2 with 
physiochemical measurements, orbital parameters, and global stacks of temperature and benthic 
δ18O (Figure 5). In this analysis, only data that are clearly associated with the broad maxima or 
minima in temperature and marine isotope stage are plotted, as determined by visual comparison

22 
with both a benthic δ18O values [Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005] and a global stack of surface 
temperatures [Snyder, 2016]. Omitted are intermediate data that fall between these climate 
extrema and, due to age model uncertainty, cannot be easily associated with a particular stage; 
the MIS intervals and maximum/minimum pCO2 values are listed in Table S2. 
 
With which orbital cycle is pCO2 most closely related in the early Pleistocene? Cross-plots show 
that in the late Pleistocene, periods of peak pCO2 are associated with orbital eccentricity, but in 
the early Pleistocene peak interglacial pCO2 is correlated with increased tilt (obliquity) in Earth’s 
rotation axis (Figure 5). The association of pCO2 and obliquity supports the notion that pCO2 
was linked with the orbital insolation cycle and surface temperatures, even in the 41-kyr world 
before the mid-Pleistocene transition, but that the linkages took a different form, which resulted 
in climate that was in phase with obliquity. This finding is consistent with previously proposed 
hypotheses for maintaining ~41-kyr periodicity of glacial-interglacial change in the early 
Pleistocene, either through meridional temperature gradients or ice dynamics. In the early 
Pleistocene, the 41-kyr cycle could have been promoted by amplified equator-to-pole 
temperature gradients that carried additional moisture poleward to build ice sheets [Raymo and 
Nisancioglu, 2003] and/or by thinner, fast-spreading Laurentide ice sheets [Clark et al., 2006]. 
The glacial-interglacial temperature perturbations that drive glacial-interglacial climate would 
likely have been further amplified by obliquity-scale radiative pCO2 feedbacks.  
 
4.2 Glacial pCO2 decreased through the Pleistocene 
Site 668B δ11BT. sacculifer values indicate that early and late Pleistocene maximum interglacial 
pCO2 did not change across the MPT (average interglacial peak pCO2 at 1.2-1.8 Ma: 303 (±12) 
µatm, average interglacial peak pCO2 at 0-0.5 Ma: 299 (±16) µatm (two-tailed t-test of all peak 
interglacial pCO2 values, P>0.7). However, minimum glacial pCO2 values declined by ~25 µatm 
between the early and late Pleistocene (average minimum pCO2 at 1.2-1.8 Ma: 213 (±10) µatm, 
average minimum pCO2 at 0-0.5 Ma: 187 (±10) µatm (two-tailed t-test of glacial minimum

23 
values, P<0.05). These pCO2 estimates are congruent with proxy records of warmer glacial 
temperatures in the early Pleistocene than the late Pleistocene and support the initial observation 
that glacial pCO2 declined across the MPT [Hönisch et al., 2009; Chalk et al., 2017]. While the 
collapse of North Atlantic deep-water formation around 900 ka coincides with this decrease in 
glacial pCO2 [e.g., Pena and Goldstein, 2014], our atmospheric estimates do not allow us to 
determine the cause of the pCO2 drawdown. However, the covariation of ocean circulation and 
pCO2 shifts over the MPT to longer, colder glacial intervals highlights the close association of 
ocean dynamics, atmospheric circulation, and climate in the Pleistocene [e.g., Clark et al., 2006]. 
 
Glacial pCO2 was higher in the early Pleistocene than the late Pleistocene, just as glacial 
temperatures were also 2-2.2 K warmer in the period 1.2-1.8 Ma than in the period 0-0.5 Ma 
based on multiple compilations of temperature change between the early and late Pleistocene  
[Herbert et al., 2010; Martínez-Botí et al., 2015a; Snyder, 2016]. If average surface temperature 
is due to the radiative pCO2 forcing alone, an equilibrium response of global temperature to such 
forcing can be calculated. At its most basic, this calculation is commonly given in the form of 
S[CO2] = ∆T/∆F[CO2] where ∆T (change in global average surface temperature) and ∆F[CO2] 
(change in radiative forcing due to pCO2) are millennial-scale averages and all other forcing 
mechanisms are regarded as internal feedbacks. Here the canonical radiative forcing due to CO2 
is used, where ∆F[CO2] = 5.35 * ln(C/278 µatm) and C is atmospheric pCO2 [Myhre et al., 1998]. 
For the early Pleistocene we thus calculate an equilibrium temperature response to radiative CO2 
forcing as S[CO2] = 0.75 (±0.5) ºC/Wm-2. For the late Pleistocene, the parallel calculation yields 
S[CO2] = 1.75 (±0.6) ºC/Wm-2 (Figure 6). To the first order, these relationships imply that climate 
sensitivity to radiative greenhouse gas forcing increased by a factor of ~2 between 1.2 and 0.5 
Ma, largely driven by lower glacial-interglacial temperature amplitude in the early Pleistocene. 
 
In reality, however, climate feedbacks such as ice sheets and ocean circulation also amplify the 
range of global average temperature [e.g., Köhler et al., 2015; von der Heydt et al., 2016].

----- Page 24 (native) -----
24 
Recent studies have pointed out that in order to project the climate effects of rising pCO2 levels 
in a warmer world with smaller ice sheets, climate sensitivity must account for the temperature 
response to each climate parameter separately (i.e., CO2, ice sheets, etc.) [e.g., Köhler et al., 
2015; Schmidt et al., 2017]. The lower early Pleistocene climate sensitivity calculated above is a 
result of comparing between time periods in which, at minimum, ice dynamics have changed 
[Raymo et al., 2006; Shakun et al., 2016]. Though this dataset does not allow us to quantify 
changes in albedo and atmospheric circulation, increased glacial ice volume (and vertical growth 
of ice sheets) at the MPT is an important change in the earth system that could have amplified 
glacial-interglacial temperature variability. Increased ice volume cools global temperature 
through two pathways: by increasing ice sheet extent, which increased global albedo, and 
through taller ice sheets, which deflected cold northern hemisphere atmospheric jets southward 
and compressed the subtropical atmospheric bands [Manabe and Broccoli, 1985; Shinn and 
Barron, 1989; Clark et al., 1999]. Qualitatively, then, these additional ice sheet and ocean 
feedbacks, in conjunction with lower atmospheric pCO2, worked to cool glacial temperatures 
across the mid-Pleistocene transition. 
 
4.3 Model comparison  
We evaluate these reconstructions of early and late Pleistocene pCO2 with a simple numerical 
box model that allows for an initial exploration of Pleistocene climate sensitivity given the 
available surface temperature and pCO2 data. This model has three coupled components: ice 
sheets, temperature, and carbon dioxide levels. We force this model with atmospheric insolation 
over glacial cycles to explore the effect of Laurentide ice sheet changes for climate sensitivity. 
This model has been documented elsewhere [Schmidt et al., 2017]; briefly, this model includes 
coupling between ice sheet volume (L) and global average surface temperature (T) and between 
surface temperature and carbon dioxide levels (C) but does not incorporate 3D geography or

and the non-Planck feedback (λ) are tested via 20x20 experiments (varying a = [0,30] mSL K-1 
and λ = [2.8,4.6] Wm-2 K-1). These parameters are consistent with the full range of late 
Pleistocene observations [Köhler et al., 2010]. 
 
We use this model to explore the qualitative impact of increasing ice volume on global climate at 
the MPT. Geochemical evidence and ice sheet models suggest that the Laurentide ice sheet of the 
early Pleistocene was thinner due to a “slippery” layer of weathered regolith over solid bedrock 
[Clark and Pollard, 1998; Clark et al., 2006], but that the spatial extent of land ice was similar to 
the late Pleistocene ice ages [Roy et al., 2004; Balco and Rovey, 2010]. Thus, the radiative 
forcing due to ice sheet albedo was roughly similar in the early and late Pleistocene, but the ice 
volume required (in equivalent meters of sea level fall) to acquire that forcing was smaller prior 
to ~1.0 Ma. We test the effect of radiative albedo forcing per ice sheet volume (µ) at 0.025 Wm-2 
mSL-1 for the late Pleistocene such that late Pleistocene ice sheets cooled the global climate by 1 
Wm-2 for each 40 meters of equivalent sea level fall, consistent with what is assumed for ice-
albedo cooling at the LGM [Köhler et al., 2010]. If the early Pleistocene Laurentide ice sheet 
was comparably expansive as in the late Pleistocene, but thinner, it can be thought of as more 
‘efficient’ at radiative albedo cooling per unit volume of ice. We investigate this idea by testing 
the parameter µ (defined above) for the early Pleistocene at double and triple the late Pleistocene 
value: at 0.05 and 0.075 Wm-2 mSL-1. This exercise is not meant to fully simulate the climate 
system, but to explore elemental system sensitivity to a realistic range of radiative CO2, 
insolation, and ice-sheet albedo forcing. 
 
The results of this model suggest that if the efficiency of ice cooling (µ) were higher in the past, 
the amplitude of temperature variability and atmospheric CO2 variability would also have been 
higher. When µ is doubled (or tripled), which simulates the large, but relatively thinner early 
Pleistocene northern hemisphere ice sheets, temperature and pCO2 amplitude are ~40 (~80% for 
tripled µ) larger. However, we do not observe this phenomenon in the early Pleistocene

geochemical datasets. Instead we observe lower temperature variability in the early Pleistocene, 
and a similar amplitude of atmospheric CO2 variability as in the late Pleistocene. These 
observations could be a consequence of only considering northern hemisphere insolation and the 
impact on Laurentide ice. Out-of-phase insolation in the southern hemisphere could have driven 
Antarctic ice in the opposite direction and dampened overall atmospheric pCO2 levels by 
modulating the Southern Ocean dynamics [Raymo et al., 2006]. Interhemispheric insolation 
differences tend to diminish the greater temperature variability that would be implied by greater 
northern hemisphere ice sheet efficiency in the early Pleistocene. 
 
The simple model described above is also designed to explore the effect of changing Laurentide 
ice sheet dynamics on climate sensitivity. As the efficiency of ice sheet cooling per unit volume 
of ice was greater for the early Pleistocene conditions (model µ is increased from 0.025 to 0.075 
Wm-2mSL-1) the model suggests that earth system sensitivity (ESS) must be higher as well. This 
particular example indicates that a three-fold increase in µ would increase ESS from 3.0 to 5.1 K 
for a doubling of atmospheric CO2. As stated previously, we observe the opposite in geochemical 
reconstructions of the early Pleistocene: because the early Pleistocene pCO2 amplitude is only 
slightly smaller than the late Pleistocene pCO2 amplitude, the associated temperature change 
with a climate sensitivity of 5.1 K per doubling of CO2 would predict a temperature amplitude of 
~4 K. In contrast, we observe a temperature amplitude of ~3 K and a correspondingly lower ESS 
in the early Pleistocene than in the late Pleistocene. This result simply suggests that earth’s 
surface temperature in the early Pleistocene is not solely determined by northern hemisphere ice 
sheets and CO2 feedbacks. Rather, other forcing factors, which are not explicitly taken into 
account in this model (e.g., tropical and Southern Ocean dynamics, southern hemisphere 
insolation, Antarctic ice sheets) must be responsible for helping to dampen glacial-interglacial 
temperature amplitude in the early Pleistocene.

As the boron isotope proxy gains maturity and acceptance in the scientific community, the 
number of δ11B-based datasets has increased, offering an opportunity to glean more detailed 
insight into the interplay between pCO2 and climate. In Figure 7 we compile new pCO2 estimates 
alongside ice-core records of late Pleistocene pCO2 [Bereiter et al., 2015; Higgins et al., 2015] 
and six published records of δ11B-based pCO2. As described above, the δ11B-based pCO2 data 
[Hönisch et al., 2009; Seki et al., 2010; Bartoli et al., 2011; Henehan et al., 2013; Martínez-Botí 
et al., 2015a; Chalk et al., 2017], have been recalculated to minimize differences in the chemical 
and physical boundary conditions estimated for each record (see Section 2.7). It is worth 
reiterating that the resulting pCO2 values are primarily dependent on the published δ11B 
measurements and that our minor revisions in boundary condition treatment do not shift average 
pCO2 estimates outside of the published 2σ uncertainty bands.  
 
Paleo-pCO2 estimates based on δ11B values of either T. sacculifer or G. ruber [Bartoli et al., 
2011; Martínez-Botí et al., 2015a] suggest that pCO2 declined by 50-100 µatm between 2.8 and 
2.6 Ma (Figure 8). This pCO2 drawdown, coincident with the onset of northern hemisphere 
glaciation [Raymo, 1994; Haug et al., 1999] is thought to be the result of increased glacial dust 
load and greater biological productivity in high-nitrate low-chlorophyll regions [Bailey et al., 
2011] or polar stratification which sequestered carbon in the deep ocean in both the north Pacific 
[e.g., Haug et al., 1999; Sigman et al., 2004] and the Southern Ocean [Hodell and Venz-Curtis, 
2006; Waddell et al., 2009; Martínez-Garcia et al., 2011]. The pCO2 initial drawdown at 2.8-2.6 
Ma is implicated in the increased glaciation of Greenland and the northern hemisphere more 
broadly [Lunt et al., 2008]. 
 
Nonetheless, a distinct mismatch exists between the two δ11B-based pCO2 estimates from Site 
999A (Figures 7, 8) for much of the late Pliocene. Where these two records overlap (from 3.3-2.3 
Ma), the G. ruber-based pCO2 estimates are on average 90 µatm higher than the T. sacculifer 
estimates (Figures 7, 8). This difference is apparent to a small degree even where G. ruber and T.

28 
sacculifer records overlap in the late Pleistocene, and as a mismatch between G. ruber and ice 
core records (Figure S8), although the species difference is larger further back in time. We can 
rule out discrepancies in environmental temperature as impacting the equilibrium constants 
because the Mg/Ca-based temperature reconstructions from the two datasets are 
indistinguishable (Figure S7-B). As we have already precluded inconsistent treatment of the 
physicochemical boundary conditions, the difference is more likely rooted in the underlying δ11B 
data of G. ruber and T. sacculifer, where δ11BG. ruber decreases more strongly between the last 
glacial cycle and the late Pliocene than δ11BT. sacculifer. It is important to explore this discrepancy, 
which could be explained a biologically-mediated shift in the δ11Bcalcite to δ11Bborate calibration 
(Figure S9), as differential pCO2 results have important implications for Plio-Pleistocene climate 
research [e.g., Martínez-Botí et al., 2015a]. 
 
Differences in the pCO2 reconstructions from these two surface dwelling foraminifera could in 
theory result from diagenetic alteration or incomplete sample cleaning. However, in the specific 
case of the late Pliocene data, evaluation of these factors is partly constrained by the fact that 
both species have been analyzed from the same sediment core. The first of these arguments 
relates to the potential bias due to partial dissolution, which typically lowers the δ11B value by 
preferential removal of higher-δ11B calcite [e.g., Hönisch and Hemming, 2004]. Both Pliocene 
data sets were measured using material from the same shallow core, so diagenetic alteration due 
to regional changes in the lysocline can reasonably be excluded. Could dissolution susceptibility 
be species-specific [e.g., Berger, 1967]? Higher pCO2 estimates are based on relatively lower 
δ11B values, suggesting that G. ruber would have to be relatively more dissolved that T. 
sacculifer. Shell-weight evidence indeed suggests that G. ruber is slightly more susceptible to 
partial dissolution than T. sacculifer based on in situ and laboratory work [e.g., Thunell and 
Honjo, 1981]. In actuality, however, studies of foraminiferal δ11B from depth transects have 
suggested that G. ruber δ11B values may be more robust and not greatly affected by partial 
dissolution [Ni et al., 2007; Seki et al., 2010; Henehan et al., 2013] and that the foraminiferal

29 
δ11B signature is preserved even when the shell is visibly recrystallized [Edgar et al., 2015]. 
Another factor which could lower δ11B values is contamination from pelagic clays, whose δ11B 
values typically fall in the -7 to +5‰ range [Ishikawa and Nakamura, 1993] and are thus much 
lower than δ11B of foraminiferal calcite. For the G. ruber pCO2 estimates to agree with the T. 
sacculifer estimates, clay contamination would have to explain the -1‰ discrepancy in δ11BG. 
ruber. This would require the G. ruber samples to have contained ~5 wt % clay, which is unlikely 
given the robust cleaning protocol applied to remove impurities and the careful contaminant 
screening for aluminum and iron [e.g., Martínez-Botí et al., 2015a; Chalk et al., 2017].  
 
At this point we have reasonably ruled out dissolution differences and clay contamination in 
addition to differential temperature calibrations, δ11Bsw values, salinity, and alkalinity estimates. 
It is therefore more likely that the difference is biological. Although both foraminifera species 
and instrumental techniques have been calibrated using modern cultured and core top specimens 
and shown to replicate the ice-core pCO2 record of the last glacial cycle [Hönisch and Hemming, 
2004; 2005; Foster, 2008; Henehan et al., 2013; Chalk et al., 2017], one or both of the studied 
foraminifer species could have evolved prior to the last glacial cycle. One line of evidence for 
such an evolutionary shift has been described by Bartoli et al. [2011], who could not find enough 
Pliocene T. sacculifer specimens in the >500 µm test size fraction and instead substituted 
specimens in the 425-500 µm range. Hönisch and Hemming [2004] observed no significant 
difference in δ11BT. sacculifer between the 425-500 and >500 µm test size fraction, suggesting that 
the depth habitat and ecology is the same for both of the large size fractions. Indeed, if the 
overall smaller specimens of the largest size fraction in the early Pleistocene sediments had 
inhabited a deeper water depth, T. sacculifer should have recorded lower δ11B, which would 
imply lower pH and elevated pCO2. Instead, we observe the opposite pattern: T. sacculifer pCO2 
estimates are lower than those based on G. ruber [Seki et al., 2010; Martínez-Botí et al., 2015a; 
Chalk et al., 2017].

Could the response of G. ruber to ocean pH have evolved over the Plio-Pleistocene? 
Interestingly, in the modern Caribbean the pink variety of G. ruber is quite abundant, whereas 
the culture and global core top calibration of Henehan et al. [2013] is based on the white variety. 
The canonical G. ruber morphospecies represents up to five genetically distinct varieties each 
with non-unique ecological and biogeographic preferences. In contrast, T. sacculifer does not 
exhibit such cryptic diversity [Darling and Wade, 2008; André et al., 2012]. Confidence in the 
δ11B proxy of pCO2 in the Pliocene and early Pleistocene is strengthened by good proxy 
replication of pCO2 with the ice core record (past 800 ka). In comparing the last two glacial 
cycles, average G. ruber δ11B values are ~0.3‰ lower in MIS 6 even as pCO2 derived from ice 
cores is nearly identical in MIS 2 and 6 [Chalk et al., 2017]. Using a consistent method for 
estimating temperature, in this case via Evans and Müller [2012], the pCO2 calculated from G. 
ruber δ11B is ~40 µatm higher in MIS 6 than in MIS 2. This result suggests that evolutionary 
differences in G. ruber could be as young as ~200 ka. Once again, the Mg/Ca-based 
temperatures derived from these two species do not diverge in the Plio-Pleistocene (3.3-2.3 Ma), 
which implies that the difference in reconstructed pCO2 is less likely due to changes in habitat 
depth or seasonal preferences.  
 
Finally, pCO2 estimates from other proxy archives are at odds with the highest Pliocene G. 
ruber-based pCO2 estimates (Figure 8). For example, evidence from the alkenone δ13C proxy 
suggests relatively lower (<350 µatm) levels of late Pliocene pCO2, whether derived from Site 
999A, (high resolution data: 270±40) [Badger et al., 2013], (low resolution data: 330±40) [Seki 
et al., 2010], or from Site 925 in eastern tropical Atlantic (320±40) [Zhang et al., 2013]. While 
different proxies have different uncertainties, the larger amplitude of Pliocene pCO2 change in 
the G. ruber-based record (~150 µatm as opposed to ~100 µatm in the T. sacculifer-based 
record) is difficult to justify given the smaller amplitude of glacial-interglacial cycles in the 
Pliocene [Lisiecki and Raymo, 2005]. In summary, although we cannot unequivocally state

which species may have changed behavior, it will be important to cross-calibrate the δ11B proxy 
in the Pliocene with regard to potential physiological distinctions.  
 
Importantly, both G. ruber and T. sacculifer record a pCO2 decline through the Plio-Pleistocene 
(Figures 7, 8), but the extent of the pCO2 decline is larger for G. ruber reconstructions and this 
has critical implications for estimates of climate sensitivity from these two species. If the 
Pliocene G. ruber-based pCO2 estimate is correct, then late Pliocene (3.3–2.8 Ma) pCO2 levels 
were relatively high (>350 µatm), and highly variable, and then dramatically declined at the 
onset of northern hemisphere glaciation. Martínez-Botí et al. [2015a] use this data to infer low 
sensitivity to radiative pCO2 forcing in the Pliocene and higher sensitivity in the Pleistocene. 
They call out increased continental ice-albedo as the primary mechanism for this change in 
sensitivity and use, as one line of evidence, the inflection point at ~275 µatm in the relationship 
between benthic δ18O and forcing due to pCO2 changes [Martínez-Botí et al., 2015a]. Here we 
replot this figure using all available datasets discussed herein, but we also separate the two  
species (Figure 9). Martínez-Botí et al. [2015a] originally excluded the data of Bartoli et al. 
[2011] from their plot to improve clarity, but it now emerges that the change in slope of the 
relationship observed by Martínez-Botí et al. [2015a] is only true for G. ruber but not for T. 
sacculifer (Figure 9). Explaining the larger Plio-Pleistocene CO2 drawdown inferred by the G. 
ruber δ11B record requires significant increases in ocean stratification, dust fertilization, and/or 
(potentially) silicate rock weathering since the Pliocene (e.g., Martinez-Garcia et al., 2011). 
 
If, on the other hand, the Pliocene T. sacculifer-based pCO2 estimates are correct, Pliocene pCO2 
was less elevated relative to early Pleistocene pCO2 values and the linear relationship between 
benthic δ18O and pCO2 forcing extended into the Pliocene (Figure 9A). The T. sacculifer-based 
estimates, with pCO2 likely <350-400 µatm, support the evidence for lower Pliocene pCO2 from 
other proxies (Figure 8): alkenone δ13C, stomatal indices, and paleosols [e.g., Badger et al., 
2013; Da et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015] and implies that atmospheric pCO2 was relatively

similar between the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene, despite the descent into cooler polar 
temperatures. If correct, this record implies that Arctic temperatures declined at the Plio-
Pleistocene transition due to factors other than direct radiative pCO2 forcing, such as the 
thickening of northern-hemisphere ice sheets or reduced poleward oceanic heat transport. Further 
work is warranted to improve our understanding of foraminiferal vital effects on δ11B, and 
thereby improve confidence in paleo-pCO2 estimates from this proxy. 
 
5. Conclusions 
Glacial-interglacial climate cycles in the early Pleistocene (>1 Ma) were shorter and less severe 
than the iconic 100-kyr cycles of the last 0.5 million years. Our new high-resolution record of 
atmospheric pCO2 over three glacial cycles in the early Pleistocene (1.38-1.54 Ma) is closely 
linked with obliquity pacing, with an average pCO2 amplitude of 92 (±13) µatm. Over the MPT, 
glacial pCO2 declined, alongside glacial SST cooling in both the tropics and high latitudes. In 
contrast to an earlier assessment of climate sensitivity from δ11B in G. ruber, our compilation of 
pCO2 estimates from δ11B in T. sacculifer suggests apparent climate sensitivity in the early 
Pleistocene was lower compared to the late Pleistocene; the difference is likely due to changing 
ocean or ice sheet dynamics over the mid-Pleistocene. Using a simple model, we suggest that the 
lower climate sensitivity in the early Pleistocene was not directly related to the thinner, yet 
extensive, northern-hemisphere terrestrial ice sheets, but is rather a result of changing ocean 
dynamics in the southern hemisphere or tropics. The observed discrepancy in late Pliocene pCO2 
estimates based on G. ruber and T. sacculifer requires further study of potentially evolving 
species-specific vital effects in the past, so that paleo-pCO2 estimates from the proxy can be 
appreciated with confidence.

to the question of whether G. ruber and its vital effects evolved over time. Values derived from one 
early study are circled in green; these data are based on unusually low boron isotope values [Seki et 
al., 2010].
