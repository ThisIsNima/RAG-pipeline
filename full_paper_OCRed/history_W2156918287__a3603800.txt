Abstract
A SNP in the gene encoding lactase (LCT) (C/T-13910) is associated with the ability to digest
milk as adults (lactase persistence) in Europeans, but the genetic basis of lactase persistence in
Africans was previously unknown. We conducted a genotype-phenotype association study in 470

Tanzanians, Kenyans and Sudanese and identified three SNPs (G/C-14010, T/G-13915 and C/
G-13907) that are associated with lactase persistence and that have derived alleles that
significantly enhance transcription from the LCT promoter in vitro. These SNPs originated on
different haplotype backgrounds from the European C/T-13910 SNP and from each other.
Genotyping across a 3-Mb region demonstrated haplotype homozygosity extending >2.0 Mb on
chromosomes carrying C-14010, consistent with a selective sweep over the past ~7,000 years.
These data provide a marked example of convergent evolution due to strong selective pressure
resulting from shared cultural traits—animal domestication and adult milk consumption.
In most humans, the ability to digest lactose, the main carbohydrate present in milk, declines
rapidly after weaning because of decreasing levels of the enzyme lactase-phlorizin hydrolase
(LPH). LPH is predominantly expressed in the small intestine, where it hydrolyzes lactose
into glucose and galactose, sugars that are easily absorbed into the bloodstream1. However,
some individuals, particularly descendants from populations that have traditionally practiced
cattle domestication, maintain the ability to digest milk and other dairy products into
adulthood. These individuals have the ‘lactase persistence’ trait. The frequency of lactase
persistence is high in northern European populations (>90% in Swedes and Danes),
decreases in frequency across southern Europe and the Middle East (~50% in Spanish,
French and pastoralist Arab populations) and is low in non-pastoralist Asian and African
populations (~1% in Chinese, ~5%-20% in West African agriculturalists)1-3. Notably,
lactase persistence is common in pastoralist populations from Africa (~90% in Tutsi, ~50%
in Fulani)1,3.
Lactase persistence is inherited as a dominant mendelian trait in Europeans1,2,4. Adult
expression of the gene encoding LPH (LCT), located on 2q21, is thought to be regulated by
cis-acting elements5 (Fig. 1). A linkage disequilibrium (LD) and haplotype analysis of
Finnish pedigrees identified two single SNPs associated with the lactase persistence trait: C/
T-13910 and G/A-22018, located ~14 kb and ~22 kb upstream of LCT, respectively, within
introns 9 and 13 of the adjacent minichromosome maintenance 6 (MCM6) gene4 (Fig. 1).
The T-13910 and A-22018 alleles were 100% and 97% associated with lactase persistence,
respectively, in the Finnish study4, and the T-13910 allele is ~86%-98% associated with
lactase persistence in other European populations6-8. Although these alleles could simply be
in LD with an unknown regulatory mutation6, several additional lines of evidence, including
mRNA transcription studies in intestinal biopsy samples9 and reporter gene assays driven by
the LCT promoter in vitro10-12, suggest that the C/T-13910 SNP regulates LCT
transcription in Europeans.
It is hypothesized that natural selection has had a major role in determining the frequencies
of lactase persistence in different human populations since the development of cattle
domestication in the Middle East and North Africa ~7,500-9,000 years ago2,3,6,13-18. A
region of extensive LD spanning >1 Mb has been observed on European chromosomes with
the T-13910 allele, consistent with recent positive selection6,14,16-18. Based on the
breakdown of LD on chromosomes with the T-13910 allele, it is estimated14 that this allele
arose within the past ~2,000-20,000 years within Europeans, probably in response to strong
selection for the ability to digest milk as adults.
Although the T-13910 variant is likely to be the causal variant for the lactase persistence
trait in Europeans, analyses of this SNP in culturally and geographically diverse African
populations indicated that it is present (and at low frequency (<14%)) in only a few West
African pastoralist populations, such as the Fulani (or Fulbe) and Hausa from
Cameroon15,19,20. It is absent in all other African populations tested, including East
African pastoralist populations with a high prevalence of the lactase persistence trait19.

Thus, the lactase persistence trait has evolved independently in most African populations
owing to distinct genetic events15,19,20.
Here, we examine genotype-phenotype associations in 470 East Africans, and we identify
three previously undescribed variants associated with the lactase persistence trait, each of
which arose independently from the European T-13910 allele and resulted in enhanced
transcriptional activity in LCT promoter-driven reporter gene assays. We demonstrate that
the most common variant in Kenyans and Tanzanians spread rapidly to high frequency in
East Africa over the past ~7,000 years owing to the strong selective force of adult milk
consumption, and we show that chromosomes with these variants have one of the strongest
genetic signatures of natural selection yet reported in humans.
RESULTS
Frequency of lactase persistence in East African populations
We classified individuals as having lactase persistence, lactase intermediate persistence
(LIP) or lactase non-persistence (LNP) by examining the maximum rise in blood glucose
levels after administration of 50 g of lactose using a lactose tolerance test (LTT)21 in 470
individuals from 43 ethnic groups originating from Tanzania, Kenya and Sudan. These
populations speak languages belonging to the four major language families present in Africa
(Afro-Asiatic, Nilo-Saharan, Niger-Kordofanian and Khoisan) and practice a wide range of
subsistence patterns (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1 online). Because genetic
substructure can result in false genotype-phenotype associations22, we analyzed data from
samples separated by geographic region and language family, with the exception of the
Sandawe and Hadza (both click-speaking Khoisan), whom we analyzed independently (Fig.
2). We made these groupings to minimize population structure, based on a global analysis of
~1,200 unlinked nuclear markers (S.A.T. and F.A.R., unpublished data). The frequency of
lactase persistence was highest in the Afro-Asiatic–speaking Beja pastoralist population
from Sudan (88%) and lowest in the Khoisian-speaking Sandawe hunter-gatherer population
from Tanzania (26%) (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 1).
SNPs associated with lactase persistence in Africans
To identify SNPs associated with regulation of the lactase persistence trait, we sequenced
3,314 bp of intron 13 and 1,761 bp of intron 9 of MCM6 (Fig. 1c,d) in 40 LNP individuals
and 69 lactase-persistent individuals at the extremes of the phenotype distribution
(Supplementary Fig. 1 online). A newly discovered SNP, G/C-14010, showed a significant
association with the lactase persistence trait in Kenyans (n = 53; χ2 = 14.4, d.f. = 2 and P =
0.0007) and Tanzanians (n = 31; χ2 = 10.9, d.f. = 2 and P = 0.0043) (Fig. 1d). A second
newly and discovered SNP, T/G-13915, was significantly associated with lactase persistence
in Kenyans (n = 53, d.f. = 1, χ2 = 4.70, P = 0.0302) and a third newly discovered SNP, C/
G-13907, was marginally significantly associated with lactase persistence in the Beja
population from northern Sudan (n = 11, d.f. = 1, χ2 = 2.93, P = 0.0869) (Fig. 1d).
Sequencing of these regions in a panel of great apes indicated that the C-14010, G-13915
and G-13907 alleles are derived.
In order to determine regional haplotype structure and further characterize the frequency and
degree of association of these alleles, we genotyped 123 SNPs (including G/C-14010, T/
G-13915 and C/G-13907) across a 3-Mb region flanking the MCM6 and LCT genes in the
full set of 470 individuals with reliable phenotype data and in 24 additional individuals (Fig.
1a and Supplementary Table 2 online). We determined the genotype-phenotype distribution
and χ2 tests of association for our three candidate SNPs (Fig. 3a-d) with data partitioned
according to classification of lactase persistence, LIP or LNP in major geographic regions.

Additionally, we used a linear-regression approach23,24 (which accounts for the continuous
phenotype distribution) to test for an association between all 123 SNPs and a rise in blood
glucose after digestion of lactose. G/C-14010 is the most significantly associated SNP in the
Kenyan Nilo-Saharan and Tanzanian Afro-Asiatic populations (r2 = 0.19 and 0.16, and P =
2.67 × 10−7 and 2.79 × 10−4, respectively; Fig. 3e) as well as in overall populations
combined in the meta-analysis (P = 2.9 × 10−7; Fig. 3f). Although C/G-13907 and T/
G-13915 are associated with the phenotype, this association was not statistically significant
after Bonferroni correction in either the individual populations or in the meta-analysis (Fig.
3e,f). The C-14010, G-13915 and G-13907 alleles in Africans exist on haplotype
backgrounds that are divergent from each other and from the European T-13910 haplotype
background (Fig. 4).
Based on analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the phenotypes for each of the six classes of
observed compound G/C-14010, T/G-13915 and C/G-13907 genotypes, ~20% of the total
phenotypic variation is accounted for by the genotypes in the pooled sample, suggesting that
there are environmental and/or measurement factors, and possibly unidentified genetic
factors, influencing the LTT phenotype in this data set.
Frequency of G/C-14010, T/G-13915 and C/G-13907 in Africans
Genotype frequencies for G/C-14010, T/G-13915 and C/G-13907 are shown in Figure 2b,
whereas Supplementary Table 1 gives allele frequencies for these SNPs as well as the
European lactase persistence–associated SNPs C/T-13910 and G/A-22018. The T-13910
allele is absent in all of the African populations tested, and we observed the A-22018 allele
in a single heterozygous Akie individual from Tanzania. The C-14010 allele is common in
Nilo-Saharan populations from Tanzania (39%) and Kenya (32%) and in Afro-Asiatic
populations from Tanzania (46%) but is at lower frequency in the Sandawe (13%) and Afro-
Asiatic Kenyan (18%) populations and is absent in the Nilo-Saharan Sudanese and Hadza
populations (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 1). The C-13907 and G-13915 alleles are at
≥5% frequency only in the Afro-Asiatic Beja populations (21% and 12%, respectively) and
in the Afro-Asiatic Kenyan populations (5% and 9%, respectively).
C-14010, G-13915 and G-13907 affect expression in vitro
In order to test whether the C-14010, G-13915 and G-13907 variants affect expression from
the LCT core promoter, we transfected the human intestinal cell line Caco-2 with luciferase
expression vectors driven by the basal 3-kb promoter alone or by the promoter fused to one
of five haplotypes of the 2-kb MCM6 intron 13 region: one haplotype with ancestral alleles
at the three candidate SNPs (G-14010, T-13915, C-13907), two haplotypes that differed only
at the derived C-14010 or G-13915 alleles, one haplotype that differed at the derived
G-13907 allele as well as at a linked T-13495 allele and one haplotype that has the ancestral
lactase persistence–associated alleles, with a T at position -13945 (to control for the effect of
this variant). Differences in luciferase expression between the basal 3-kb LCT core promoter
and the promoter plus any of the five MCM6 intron sequence constructs were highly
significant (paired t test, P < 0.001), resulting in more than a twenty-fold increase in
expression over the core promoter alone (Fig. 5).
Notably, we also observed differences in expression between the five MCM6 intron 13
haplotypes that were functionally tested using the dual-luciferase reporter assay (Fig. 5). The
C-14010–, G-13915– and G-13907–derived haplotypes consistently drove higher expression
(from ~18%-30%) than the haplotypes with the ancestral alleles. There was no statistically
significant difference in expression between the constructs with the C-14010, G-13907/
T-13495 and G-13915 alleles.

Evidence for positive selection of the C-14010 allele
If a mutation provides a large enough benefit to its carriers (in this case, the ability to digest
milk as adults), resulting in more viable offspring, it is expected to rise rapidly to high
frequency in the population, together with linked variants (that is, genetic hitchhiking)25.
Under neutrality, one expects common mutations to be older and to have lower levels of LD
with flanking markers. In contrast, one of the genetic signatures of an incomplete selective
sweep is a region of extensive LD (termed extended haplotype homozygosity or EHH) and
low variation on high-frequency chromosomes carrying the derived beneficial mutation
relative to chromosomes with the ancestral allele17,26. Over time, this pattern will degrade
owing to recombination and newly occurring mutations. Thus, by measuring the frequency
of the haplotype and extent of LD in the region, it is possible to estimate the age and
strength of a beneficial mutation.
In order to visually assess the evidence for selection on chromosomes with the C-14010
allele, we constructed plots depicting EHH for ancestral (G) and derived (C) alleles using
both unphased data (Fig. 6), as well as phase-inferred data (Fig. 7). For the unphased data,
we plotted continuous homozygosity at each of the 123 genotyped SNPs for individuals
homozygous for the ancestral (G/G-14010) and derived (C/C-14010) alleles (Fig. 6a). For
comparison, we plotted EHH for the 101 SNPs genotyped in Eurasians14 for individuals
homozygous for the ancestral (C/C-13910) and derived (T/T-13910) lactase persistence–
associated alleles (Fig. 6b). The average homozygous tract length in C/C-14010
homozygotes (n = 51) was 1.8 Mb (with a maximum of 3.15 Mb), compared with 1,800 bp
in G/G-14010 homozygotes (n = 228). In Eurasians, the average homozygous tract length in
T/T-13910 homozygotes (n = 61) was 1.4 Mb (with a maximum of 2.1 Mb), compared with
1,900 bp in C/C-13910 homozygotes (n = 38). We observed a similar result in the individual
African populations using phase-inferred data, with EHH extending as far as 2.18-2.90 Mb
(1.6-2.2 cM) (Table 1 and Fig. 7). Chromosomes with the G-13907 and G-13915 alleles
show EHH spanning ~1.4 Mb (0.56 cM) and 1.1 Mb (0.37 cM), respectively
(Supplementary Fig. 2 online).
The high frequency of the C-14010 allele and the very long stretch of homozygosity (>2
Mb) for haplotypes containing the C-14010 allele are consistent with the action of positive
selection elevating this allele and the surrounding linked variation to high frequency. To test
the neutrality of this SNP, we used a modification of the EHH test26, the integrated
haplotype score (iHS)17 (sample sizes for G-13915 and G-13907 alleles were too small for
sufficient power with the iHS test). For most populations, the iHS score was statistically
more extreme relative to iHS scores for data simulated both under a neutral model with
constant population size (P < 0.002) and under an assortment of demographic population
expansion and contraction models (Supplementary Table 3 online). All populations had
statistically more extreme scores relative to the empirical distribution of iHS scores
observed in the Yoruban HapMap data, for alleles at matching frequency (P < 0.05) (Table
1). Furthermore, as predicted, the direction of the score was consistent with the action of
positive selection on the lactase persistence–associated haplotype.
Age of variants and estimates of selection coefficients
We estimated the age of the C-14010 allele using coalescent simulations under a model
incorporating selection and recombination27. The simulations assumed either an additive (h
= 0.5) or dominant (h = 1) model for fitness (Supplementary Methods online) and were
designed to match several aspects of the data, including SNP ascertainment and density,
allele frequency, sample size, recombination profile and phase uncertainty17. We estimated
selection intensity and ages by matching simulated data to the observed cM span and the
observed frequency of the derived allele in each population. We estimated these values

(Table 1) and found extremely recent (within the last ~3,000-7,000 years; confidence
interval (c.i.) 1,200-23,200 years ago) and strong (s = 0.04-0.097, c.i. 0.01-0.15) positive
selection in many African populations.
DISCUSSION
Role of G/C-14010, T/G-13915 and C/G-13907 in LCT expression
Although we cannot rule out the possibility that G/C-14010 is in LD with another causative
SNP, our data suggest that G/C-14010 regulates LCT gene expression. First, this SNP shows
significant statistical association with the LTT phenotype in Kenyan and Tanzanian
populations (Fig. 3). Although most individuals with a C-14010 allele have moderate to high
increases in blood glucose (mean of 2.04 and 2.45 mM in heterozygotes and homozygotes,
respectively; Fig. 2b), many individuals who are homozygous for the ancestral G-14010
allele are also LIP or lactase persistent (Fig. 3), probably because of genetic heterogeneity of
this trait, as discussed further below. Additionally, there is likely to be phenotype
measurement error due to working in field conditions and to the relative insensitivity of the
LTT test (see Methods). Also, individuals with the C-14010 allele may be classified as LNP
if they have had damage to intestinal cells caused by infectious disease21.
Second, we observe extensive LD on chromosomes with the C-14010 allele, with haplotype
homozygosity extending >2 Mb (Figs. 6 and 7). Of the 123 SNPs genotyped, high LD (D’ >
0.9, LOD score ≥ 2) extends farthest for SNP G/C-14010 (Supplementary Fig. 3 online) and
is inconsistent with demographic models that incorporate even extreme bottlenecks. In fact,
this region of haplotype identity, spanning 2.18-2.9 Mb (1.6-2.2 cM), is more extensive than
any span of identity derived from HapMap data from global populations16,17. These results
suggest that chromosomes with the C-14010 allele have rapidly risen to high frequency in
East African populations owing to strong positive selection, consistent with a functional role
of this variant. Last, analyses of transcriptional regulation of the LCT promoter in vitro
indicate that otherwise identical constructs with a C-14010 allele consistently produce ~18%
more luciferase than constructs with the G-14010 allele (Fig. 5), an increase in transcription
similar to that observed for the T-13910 allele in Europeans10,11 (Supplementary
Discussion online).
We have also identified two additional variants, G-13907 and G-13915, at ≥5% frequency
only in the Afro-Asiatic–speaking Beja from Sudan and in Afro-Asiatic–speaking Kenyans,
that are on haplotype backgrounds that increase gene expression by ~18%-30% compared
with the ancestral haplotypes (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Discussion). Although SNPs T/
G-13915 and C/G-13907 are associated with a mean rise in blood glucose of 3.18 and 3.99
mM in heterozygotes, respectively (Fig. 2b), these associations are not significant in the
subpopulations or in the meta-analysis (Fig. 3), possibly because of small sample size and
loss of power for these SNPs. Additionally, chromosomes with the G-13907 and G-13915
alleles show EHH spanning ~1.4 Mb and ~1.1 Mb, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 2).
Although these results suggest that G-13915 and G-13907 are probable candidate LCT
regulatory mutations, larger sample sizes from populations containing these alleles are
required to test for an association with the lactase persistence trait and to rule out the
possibility that they are simply in LD with a different causal SNP. Identification of
transcription factors that bind to the sites of the C-14010, T-13915 and G-13907 variants
would also be informative for clarifying the possible role of these variants in regulating LCT
expression.

Adaptive significance and the origins of pastoralism
Archeological evidence suggests that cattle domestication originated in southern Egypt as
early as ~9,000 years ago but no later than ~7,700 years ago and in the Middle East
~7,000-8,000 years ago28, consistent with the age estimate of ~8,000-9,000 years (95% c.i.
~2,200-19,200 years) for the T-13910 allele in Europeans. The more recent age estimate of
the C-14010 allele in African populations, ~2,700-6,800 years (95% c.i. ~1,200-23,000
years), is consistent with archeological data indicating that pastoralism did not spread south
of the Sahara and into northern Kenya until ~4,500 years ago and into southern Kenya and
northern Tanzania ~3,300 years ago28,29. The ability to digest milk as adults is likely to be
adaptive owing to the increased nutritional benefits from milk (carbohydrates as well as fat,
protein and calcium) and also because milk is an important source of water in arid
regions2,28,30,31. Considering the symptoms of lactose intolerance, which includes water
loss from diarrhea, individuals who had the lactase persistence–associated alleles and could
tolerate milk could have had a very strong selective advantage2. This is supported by our
high estimates for the selection coefficient (s = 0.035-0.097). Because the selective force,
adult milk consumption, is associated with the cultural development of cattle domestication,
the recent and rapid spread of the lactase persistence–associated alleles, together with the
practice of pastoralism in East Africa, is an excellent example of ongoing adaptation in
humans32 and coevolution of genes and culture3.
We observe the oldest age estimates of the C-14010 allele, ~6,000-7,000 years (95% c.i.
~2,000-16,000 years), in the Kenyan Nilo-Saharan and Tanzanian Afro-Asiatic populations
(Table 1). We also observe an old age estimate in the Tanzanian Sandawe, but its low
frequency suggests it was introduced via recent gene flow (Supplementary Discussion).
However, we cannot distinguish with certainty whether this allele first arose in the Cushitic-
speaking Afro-Asiatic populations, who are thought to have migrated into Kenya and
Tanzania from Ethiopia ~5,000 years ago33 and practice a mixture of agriculture and
pastoralism, or in the Nilotic-speaking Nilo-Saharan populations, who are thought to have
migrated into Kenya and Tanzania from southern Sudan within the past ~3,000 years33 and
are strict pastoralists28. These results are consistent with both linguistic34 and genetic data
(F.A.R. and S.A.T., unpublished data) indicating cultural exchange and genetic admixture
between these groups. The absence of C-14010 in the southern Sudanese Nilo-Saharan–
speaking populations suggests that this allele either originated in or was introduced to the
Kenyan Nilo-Saharan populations after their migration from southern Sudan. Regardless of
the population origins of the C-14010 allele, it spread rapidly throughout the region along
with the cultural practice of pastoralism, consistent with a demic diffusion model of genetic
and cultural expansion35.
Implications for identifying disease-associated variants
It has been hypothesized that genetic variants associated with both mendelian diseases (such
as sickle cell anemia and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency) and
common complex diseases (such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity and asthma) may be at
high frequency in modern populations because they were adaptive in ancient
environments16,17,36-38. Thus, identification of loci that are targets of natural selection
could be informative for identifying disease-risk alleles. The rapid increase in frequency of
geographically restricted lactase persistence–associated alleles is an example of local
adaptation that would have been missed by studying other African populations, such as the
Yoruba, which do not show a signature of selection at LCT in the HapMap data set16,17.
Because of the possibility that disease-associated alleles may also be geographically
restricted owing to recent, local adaptation, these results suggest the importance of
resequencing analyses in multiple populations, even from within a single geographic region
such as Africa.

Our study also indicates how challenging it may be to identify alleles that are targets of
selection. Networks of the 98-kb region encompassing the LCT and MCM6 genes (Fig. 4)
indicate several haplotypes that are at high frequency in global populations and that have
ancestral alleles at the lactase persistence–associated SNPs (that is, haplotypes D and E)
(Fig. 4). Based on a single-factor ANOVA test, neither of these haplotypes is significantly
associated with the lactase persistence phenotype (P = 0.20 and P = 0.058, respectively). The
only difference between lactase persistence–associated haplotype F and the ancestral
haplotype E is the single G→C substitution at position 14010. The presence of these
globally common haplotypes that are identical over at least 98 kb raises the possibility that
there have been additional selective sweeps in the LCT-MCM6 gene region, possibly
unrelated to LCT gene expression and confounding the haplotype-based inference of
selection at LCT (Supplementary Discussion).
Convergent evolution of LP-associated variants
These data suggest that at least two, and probably four or more, distinct causal variants
associated with lactase persistence (T-13910 in Europeans and C-14010, G-13907 and
G-13915 in Africans) have evolved independently in European and African populations
owing to convergent evolution in response to a strong selective force, adult milk
consumption. These variants arose on highly divergent haplotype backgrounds that are
geographically restricted (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Discussion), but they do not account
for all of the phenotypic variation, particularly in the Nilo-Saharan Sudanese and Hadza
(Fig. 2). Therefore, it is likely that there are additional lactase persistence–associated
variants in Africans.
Notably, the Hadza population of Tanzania, who speak a click language and subsist by
hunting and gathering, have the lactase persistence phenotype at ~50% frequency (Fig. 2a),
suggesting that either the Hadza descend from a pastoralist population or that the lactase
persistence trait may be adaptive for something other than milk digestion (Supplementary
Discussion). These results, which should be confirmed in a larger sample, add to the
mystery of the origins of the Hadza and their relationship to other click-speaking
populations in Africa.
In conclusion, multiple independent variants have allowed various human populations to
quickly modify LCT expression and have been strongly adaptive in adult milk-consuming
populations, emphasizing the importance of regulatory mutations in recent human
evolution39. Further resequencing and genotype-phenotype analyses in Africa, particularly
in populations that lack the C-14010 allele, will be necessary for identifying additional
lactase persistence–associated variants. Once these variants are identified, genotype analyses
in a broader set of African populations will be informative for reconstructing an even more
complete history of adaptation to pastoralism in Africa.
METHODS
DNA samples
Tanzanian DNA samples were collected from individuals residing in the Arusha and
Dodoma provinces of Tanzania. Kenyan samples were collected in the Rift Valley, Nyanza
and Eastern provinces of Kenya. Sudanese samples were collected in the Khartoum and
Kasala provinces of the Sudan. Institutional Review Board approval for this project was
obtained from the University of Maryland at College Park. Written informed consent was
obtained from all participants, and research permits from the Tanzanian Commission for
Science and Technology, Tanzanian National Institute for Medical Research, the Kenya
Medical Research Institute and the University of Khartoum were obtained prior to sample

collection. Samples were grouped according to self-identified ethnolinguistic ancestry from
unrelated individuals. Ethnic groups, number of individuals sampled, language classification
and subsistence classification are given in Supplementary Table 1. White cells were isolated
in the field from whole blood using a modified salting-out procedure40, and DNA was
extracted in the laboratory using a Purgene DNA extraction kit (Gentra).
Phenotype test
The LTT measures elevation in blood glucose levels after consumption of 50 g of lactose
(equivalent to ~1-2 l of cow’s milk)21. Blood was obtained via a finger prick and baseline
glucose levels were measured by an Accucheck Advantage glucose monitor and Accucheck
Comfort Strips (Roche). Blood glucose levels were obtained 20, 40 and 60 min after
consumption of 50 g of lactose (Quintron) dissolved in 250 ml water. Based on
manufacturer recommendation, glucose values were adjusted based on previously
determined error associated with use of the Comfort Strip Curves according to the following
regression equation: y = 0.985x – 7.5, where x is the measured glucose value. We
determined the maximum rise in glucose level compared with baseline values. We used the
following definitions to classify individuals: an individual with a rise of >1.7 mM was
classified as ‘lactase persistent’; one with a rise of <1.1 mM was classified as ‘lactase non-
persistent’ and one with a rise of 1.1-1.7 mM was considered ambiguous and classified as
‘lactase intermediate persistent’21. There is likely to be some error in phenotype
classification owing to administration of the test under field conditions. The LTT test is less
reliable than determining lactase enzyme activity directly by intestinal biopsy2,21, with a
false negative rate (that is, lactase-persistent individuals being misclassified as LNP) as high
as 23%-30% (ref. 21). Although more accurate indirect tests exist (such as determination of
urinary galactose after inclusion of ethanol with the lactose load or a hydrogen breath
test21), these were not feasible in remote locations in Africa. In addition, we were not able
to ensure that participants had fasted for at least 8 h prior to administration of the test, as
recommended in clinical settings2, although most participants indicated that they had not
eaten for at least several hours prior to testing (Supplementary Methods).
Sequence analysis
A 3,314-bp region encompassing intron 13 of MCM6 and a 1,761-bp region encompassing
intron 9 were amplified by PCR (Fig. 1c,d) in 110 individuals (69 lactase-persistent and 40
LNP): 16 lactase-persistent and 10 LNP from Sudan, 36 lactase-persistent and 17 LNP from
Kenya and 17 lactase-persistent and 14 LNP from Tanzania (primers and PCR conditions
are given in Supplementary Methods). PCR products were prepared for sequencing with
shrimp alkaline phosphatase and exonuclease I (US Biochemicals). All nucleotide sequence
data were obtained using the ABI Big Dye v3.1 terminator kit and 3730xl automated
sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Sequence files were aligned and SNPs identified using
Sequencher software (v. 4.0.5; GeneCodes).
SNP genotyping
We selected 146 SNPs for genotyping from ref. 14, dbSNP and the resequencing of introns 9
and 13 of MCM6 in the individuals listed above. All SNPs were genotyped in 494 samples.
Following ref. 14, the SNPs were chosen to represent a large area on chromosome 2 but with
increased density in the LCT and MCM6 gene regions (Fig. 1a). SNPs were also included
that had previously been shown to be associated with lactase persistence in Europeans (C/
T-13910 and G/A-22018) or that seemed to be associated with lactase persistence based on
the initial resequencing screen described above. SNP assays were designed with
SpectroDESIGNER software (Sequenom). SNP typing was performed with the
Homogeneous Mass Extend assay (Sequenom) as described elsewhere41. Genotyping was

carried out at a multiplex level of up to ten SNPs per well, and data quality was assessed by
duplicate DNAs (n = 7 in triplicate). SNPs with more than one discrepant call or those
showing self-priming in the negative control (water) were removed. Finally, we removed
SNPs with call rates below 70% and flagged markers that departed from Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium (P < 0.001). A total of 123 SNPs (of which seven were monomorphic) passed
quality control and were included in the final analysis; these included 79 SNPs from ref. 14,
34 SNPs from dbSNP and ten SNPs from resequencing (five from intron 9 and five from
intron 13) (Supplementary Table 2).
Genotype-phenotype association tests
We determined genotype-phenotype association for data binned into lactase-persistent, LNP
and LIP classifications using a χ2 test. The degrees of freedom for the χ2 test are calculated
as (number of phenotypes − 1) × (number of genotypes − 1). In cases where there were low
expected cell counts (<5), cells were pooled to satisfy Cochran’s guidelines42. Because the
phenotype (rise in blood glucose) is a continuous trait, we also used a least-squares linear
regression approach to test for significant genotype-phenotype associations24. This method
avoids the loss of information that may arise from binning the phenotype into discrete
categories. For each SNP, different homozygotes were assigned to values of 0 or 1, and
heterozygotes were assigned an intermediate genotype value of 0.5 (assuming an additive
model). Next, a linear regression was fit to the x-axis genotype values and y-axis phenotypes
(rise in glucose). The resulting r2 and P values were recorded as measures of the degree of
association. Because of the large amount of multiple testing (123 SNPs), a significant
association was determined after applying a conservative Bonferroni P-value correction.
Combined population meta-analysis
In order to both gain statistical power and avoid the issues of population stratification, we
conducted a meta-analysis on the results of the association tests in the individual
geographic-linguistic populations. This was done by combining the P values for each SNP
over k populations in an unweighted Z transform test according to the following equation43:
where Zi is the Z score of the standard normal curve corresponding to the P value from an
individual population phenotype-genotype regression, and Zmeta is the Z score for the
combined meta-analysis. This method tests for a skew in the overall distribution of P values
(from tests in individual populations) regardless of the significance of any individual test
and allows us to regain some of the power that was lost by dividing the data into smaller
groups.
ANOVA
A single-factor ANOVA was used to test for a significant difference in phenotypes between
the two common haplotypes (D and E) in the LCT-MCM6 region (Fig. 4a) and all other
haplotypes, after individuals carrying a C-14010 and/or a G-13907 and/or a G-13915 allele
(or unknown genotypes at any of these three markers) had been removed. An ANOVA was
also used to quantify the overall variation in phenotype measures explained by G/C-14010,
T/G-13915 and C/G-13907; each of the ten compound genotypes found in the data set was
treated as a category.

Homozygosity plots
To visualize the extent of homozygosity on chromosomes with the lactase persistence–
associated alleles, individuals that were homozygous for the ancestral and derived alleles at
G/C-14010 and C/T-13910 SNPs were selected and the extent of continuous homozygosity
at each assayed SNP, in each direction, was plotted. Note that this is the actual measured
homozygosity and thus is independent of haplotype phase estimation but sensitive to
inbreeding.
Haplotype phase estimation
fastPHASE44 was used, with population label information, in order to estimate phased
haplotype backgrounds.
Calculation of iHS scores
We calculated iHS scores as in ref. 17 for each subpopulation for all SNPs in the region. In
calculating the scores, we used an interpolated recombination map estimated from the
HapMap project Yoruba data set16. iHS scores were standardized using estimates of the
mean and s.d. obtained via coalescent simulation under a variety of demographic models.
These simulations were tailored to match the frequency spectrum, SNP density and
recombination profile of the observed data. Alternative demographic models included either
exponential growth or a bottleneck (which varied in onset, severity, duration and population
size recovery after the bottleneck). We simulated 1,000 repetitions of each demographic
model and calculated the distribution of iHS scores for sites matching the frequency (within
2.5%) as well as position of C-14010. Supplementary Table 3 contains a description of the
demographic models (and results) and also gives empirical P-values that count the number
of simulated iHS scores for each model that exceeded (that is, were more negative than) the
observed iHS statistic. In addition, iHS scores were standardized empirically by comparison
with the Yoruba HapMap data for alleles at the same frequency as C-14010.
Estimating selection intensity and sweep ages
We applied a rejectionsampling approach using the cM span surrounding the selected site to
estimate selection intensity and ages of the candidate lactase persistence–associated
mutations for each population45 (Supplementary Methods). Point estimates for the
selection intensity and ages are presented, assuming an additive or fully dominant fitness
effect. Although our model assumes constant population size, previous studies have
demonstrated that for an allele that rapidly increases in frequency, population demographic
history has only a modest effect on allele age estimates38,46.
Because of the way that SNPs were ascertained, the allele frequency spectrum departs from
the expectation for DNA sequence data. To model the effect of ascertainment bias of SNPs
selected for genotyping, we followed the approach in ref. 17 (Supplementary Methods). In
addition, the observed data vary in SNP density, showing a dense central core region flanked
by regions with lower SNP density (on average). To match this feature of the data, a
secondary rejection step was applied such that the average SNP density for central and
flanking regions (both left and right) matched the observed density. With respect to
recombination, for each simulation we chose to exactly match the recombination map
estimated from the data using the Li and Stephens algorithm47. For all populations, we
calculated cM spans assuming the estimated population genetic map for the Yoruba
HapMap data set16 and calculated those distances assuming the rates estimated from the
deCODE genetic map48 across 40 Mb flanking this region on chromosome 2.

Network analyses
Haplotype networks were generated using the median-joining algorithm of Network 4.1.1.1
(ref. 49) for SNPs within the LCT and MCM6 gene regions from rs1042712 to rs309125,
spanning 98 kb. The root was inferred assuming the chimpanzee allelic state at each SNP is
ancestral.
Vector construction, transfection and expression assay
The LCT ‘core’ promoter, starting 3,083 bp upstream of LCT at position −3 of the
transcription start site, was amplified by PCR using high-fidelity Phusion polymerase
(Finnzyme). PCR products were then cloned and ligated into a pGL3-basic luciferase
reporter (Promega). Constructs including intron 13 of MCM6 were assembled by cloning
2,035 bp, beginning at position −14354 relative to LCT, 5′ of the ‘core’ promoter. Caco-2
cells were then transfected with these constructs. We lysed cells 48 h after transfection and
measured luciferase activity using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega)
and a Veritas Microplate Luminometer (Turner BioSystems). Transfections of cells were
performed six times for control and ‘core’ promoters and 12 times for vectors with the intron
from MCM6. The expression data were analyzed using paired t tests (Supplementary
Methods).

Genotype-phenotype association for G/C-14010, T/G-13915 and C/G-13907. (a-d) Number
of individuals in various genotype and phenotype classes in major geographic regions and/or
populations in which they are most prevalent. We observed a significant association for G/
C-14010 in Kenya (n = 190, d.f. = 4, χ2 = 21.77, P = 0.0002) and in Tanzania (n = 231, d.f.
= 4, χ2 = 21.90, P = 0.0002) We did not observe a significant association for C/G-13907 in
the Afro-Asiatic Sudanese (n = 17, d.f. = 2, χ2 = 2.54, P = 0.2808) or for T/G-13915 in
Afro-Asiatic Kenyans (n = 61, d.f. = 4, χ2 = 6.14, P = 0.1889). A large proportion of
individuals who are homozygous for the ancestral G-14010, T-13915 and C-13907 alleles
are classified as lactase persistent, indicating that there are additional unidentified variants
associated with lactase persistence in these populations. (e) Linear regression-based test of
association for each polymorphic SNP genotyped in this study in each of the subpopulations.
Dashed line denotes significance after a conservative Bonferroni correction for the total
number of SNPs tested. G/C-14010 is the most significant of all 123 genotyped SNPs in the
Kenyan Nilo-Saharan (KE-NS) and Tanzanian Afro-Asiatic (TZ-AA) samples. C/G-13907
shows the strongest (though not significant) association of all other genotyped SNPs in the
Kenyan Afro-Asiatic (KE-AA) samples. (f) Meta-analysis of the combined P values for each
SNP over all subpopulations. G/C-14010 is highly significant, even after Bonferroni
correction (P = 2.9 × 10−7). C/G-13907 and T/G-13915 are not significant after Bonferroni
correction (P = 0.001 and P = 0.002, respectively). SD-AA, Sudanese Afro-Asiatic; SD-NS,
Sudanese Nilo-Saharan; TZ-NS, Tanzanian Nilo-Saharan; TZ-NK, Tanzanian Niger-
Kordofanian; TZ-HZ, Tanzanian Hadza; TZ-SW, Tanzanian Sandawe.

Haplotype networks consisting of 55 SNPs spanning a 98-kb region encompassing LCT and
MCM6. (a) Distribution of the lactase persistence–associated haplotypes. Haplotypes with a
T allele at -13910 are indicated in blue, those with a G allele at -13907 in green, those with a
C allele at -14010 in red and those with a G allele at -13915 in yellow. The arrow points to
the inferred ancestral-state haplotype. (b) Network analysis of LCT and MCM6 haplotypes
indicating frequencies in the current data set and in Europeans, Asians and African
Americans previously genotyped in ref. 14.

Figure 5.
Dual-luciferase reporter assay of LCT promoter and MCM6 introns. As a control, cells were
transfected with the promoterless pGL3-basic vector (‘empty vector’). Basal levels of
expression were assessed using a pGL3-basic vector with 3 kb of the 5′ flanking region of
LCT (‘core promoter’). Five different haplotypes of the MCM6 intron 13 were inserted
upstream of the core promoter that differed at the following sites: (i) a haplotype that is
ancestral for the three lactase persistence–associated SNPs, with a C at position -13495; (ii)
a haplotype that is ancestral for the three lactase persistence–associated SNPs, with a T at
position -13495; (iii) a haplotype that differs from (i) only at C -14010; (iv) a haplotype that
differs from (i) at G-13907 and T-13495 and from (ii) only at G-13907; and (v) a haplotype
that differs from (i) only at G-13915. Expression levels are reported as the ratio of firefly to
Renilla luciferase; error bars represent a 95% c.i. The differences between the core promoter
alone and all five MCM6 intronic constructs, as well as between the three derived versus
two ancestral haplotypes, were significant (P < 0.0008, paired t tests). There was no
significant difference in expression between the empty vector and the core promoter,
between the two ancestral haplotypes (with and without the T-13495 allele) or between the
three derived haplotypes. The construct with ancestral lactase persistence–associated alleles
that differed at T-13495 served as an internal control for the expression differences for the
G-13907 and T-13495 alleles, indicating that only the G-13907 allele results in increased
gene expression.

ref. 14. Positions are relative to the start codon of LCT. Note that some tracks are too short
to be visible as plotted.

Figure 7.
Plots of the extent and decay of haplotype homozygosity in the region surrounding the
C-14010 allele. (a) Decay of haplotypes for the C-14010 allele in African subpopulations.
Horizontal lines are haplotypes; SNP positions are marked below the haplotype plot. These
plots are divided into two parts: the upper portion shows haplotypes with the ancestral G
allele at site -14010 (blue), and the lower portion shows haplotypes with the derived C allele
at -14010 (red). For a given SNP, adjacent haplotypes with the same color carry identical
genotypes everywhere between that SNP and the central (selected) site. The left- and right-
hand sides are sorted separately. Haplotypes are no longer plotted beyond the points at
which they become unique. Note the large extent of haplotype homozygosity surrounding
the C-14010 allele (red) extending as far as 2.9 Mb in individual populations, which is
consistent with the action of positive selection rapidly increasing the frequency of
chromosomes with the C-14010 allele. (b) Decay of extended haplotype homozygosity for
the C-14010 allele in African subpopulations over physical distance. In each case, the decay
of haplotype homozygosity for the ancestral allele (blue) occurs much more quickly than for
the derived allele (red). This is the expectation for strong positive selection acting on
haplotypes containing this derived allele. AA: Afro-Asiatic language family; NK: Niger-
Kordofanian; NS: Nilo-Saharan; SW: Sandawe.
