The Faculty of Language: What Is It, Who Has
It, and How Did It Evolve?
Marc D. Hauser,1* Noam Chomsky,2 W. Tecumseh Fitch1
We argue that an understanding of the faculty of language requires substantial
interdisciplinary cooperation. We suggest how current developments in linguistics can
be proﬁtably wedded to work in evolutionary biology, anthropology, psychology, and
neuroscience. We submit that a distinction should be made between the faculty of
language in the broad sense (FLB) and in the narrow sense (FLN). FLB includes a
sensory-motor system, a conceptual-intentional system, and the computational
mechanisms for recursion, providing the capacity to generate an inﬁnite range of
expressions from a ﬁnite set of elements. We hypothesize that FLN only includes
recursion and is the only uniquely human component of the faculty of language. We
further argue that FLN may have evolved for reasons other than language, hence
comparative studies might look for evidence of such computations outside of the
domain of communication (for example, number, navigation, and social relations).
I
f a martian graced our planet, it would be
struck by one remarkable similarity among
Earth’s living creatures and a key difference.
Concerning similarity, it would note that all
living things are de-
signed on the basis of
highly conserved de-
velopmental
systems
that read an (almost)
universal language en-
coded in DNA base
pairs. As such, life is
arranged hierarchical-
ly with a foundation
of discrete, unblend-
able units (codons, and,
for
the
most
part,
genes) capable of com-
bining to create increas-
ingly complex and vir-
tually limitless varieties
of both species and in-
dividual organisms. In
contrast, it would notice
the absence of a univer-
sal code of communi-
cation (Fig. 1).
If our martian nat-
uralist were meticu-
lous, it might note
that the faculty medi-
ating human communication appears remark-
ably different from that of other living crea-
tures; it might further note that the human
faculty of language appears to be organized
like the genetic code—hierarchical, genera-
tive, recursive, and virtually limitless with
respect to its scope of expression. With these
pieces in hand, this martian might begin to
wonder how the genetic code changed in such
a way as to generate a vast number of mutu-
ally incomprehensible communication sys-
tems across species while maintaining clarity
of comprehension within a given species. The
martian would have stumbled onto some of
the
essential
problems
surrounding
the
question of language evolution, and of how
humans acquired the faculty of language.
In exploring the problem of language evo-
lution, it is important to distinguish between
questions concerning language as a commu-
nicative system and questions concerning the
computations underlying this system, such as
those underlying recursion. As we argue be-
low, many acrimonious debates in this field
have been launched by a failure to distinguish
between these problems. According to one
view (1), questions concerning abstract com-
putational mechanisms are distinct from
those concerning communication, the latter
targeted at problems at the interface between
abstract computation and both sensory-motor
and conceptual-intentional interfaces. This
view should not, of course, be taken as a
claim against a relationship between compu-
tation and communication. It is possible, as
we discuss below, that key computational
capacities evolved for reasons other than
communication but, after they proved to have
utility in communication, were altered be-
cause of constraints imposed at both the pe-
riphery (e.g., what we can hear and say or see
and sign, the rapidity with which the auditory
cortex can process rapid temporal and spec-

tral changes) and more central levels (e.g.,
conceptual and cognitive structures, pragmat-
ics, memory limitations).
At least three theoretical issues cross-cut
the debate on language evolution. One of the
oldest
problems
among
theorists
is
the
“shared versus unique” distinction. Most cur-
rent commentators agree that, although bees
dance, birds sing, and chimpanzees grunt,
these systems of communication differ qual-
itatively from human language. In particular,
animal communication systems lack the rich
expressive and open-ended power of human
language (based on humans’ capacity for re-
cursion). The evolutionary puzzle, therefore,
lies in working out how we got from there to
here, given this apparent discontinuity. A sec-
ond issue revolves around whether the evo-
lution of language was gradual versus salta-
tional; this differs from the first issue because
a qualitative discontinuity between extant
species could have evolved gradually, involv-
ing no discontinuities during human evolu-
tion. Finally, the “continuity versus exapta-
tion” issue revolves around the problem of
whether human language evolved by gradual
extension of preexisting communication sys-
tems, or whether important aspects of lan-
guage have been exapted away from their
previous adaptive function (e.g., spatial or
numerical reasoning, Machiavellian social
scheming, tool-making).
Researchers have adopted extreme or in-
termediate positions regarding these basically
independent questions, leading to a wide
variety of divergent viewpoints on the evo-
lution of language in the current literature.
There is, however, an emerging consensus
that, although humans and animals share a
diversity of important computational and
perceptual resources, there has been sub-
stantial evolutionary remodeling since we
diverged from a common ancestor some 6
million years ago. The empirical challenge
is to determine what was inherited un-
changed from this common ancestor, what
has been subjected to minor modifications,
and what (if anything) is qualitatively new.
The additional evolutionary challenge is to
determine what selectional pressures led to
adaptive changes over time and to under-
stand the various constraints that channeled
this evolutionary process. Answering these
questions requires a collaborative effort
among linguists, biologists, psychologists,
and anthropologists.
One aim of this essay is to promote a
stronger connection between biology and
linguistics by identifying points of contact
and agreement between the fields. Al-
though this interdisciplinary marriage was
inaugurated more than 50 years ago, it has
not yet been fully consummated. We hope
to further this goal by, first, helping to
clarify the biolinguistic perspective on lan-
guage and its evolution (2–7). We then
review
some
promising
empirical
ap-
proaches to the evolution of the language
faculty, with a special focus on
comparative
work
with
non-
human animals, and conclude
with a discussion of how in-
quiry might profitably advance,
highlighting some outstanding
problems.
We make no attempt to be
comprehensive in our coverage of
relevant or interesting topics and
problems. Nor is it our goal to
review the history of the field.
Rather, we focus on topics that
make important contact between
empirical data and theoretical po-
sitions about the nature of the lan-
guage faculty. We believe that if
explorations into the problem of
language evolution are to progress,
we need a clear explication of the
computational
requirements
for
language, the role of evolutionary
theory in testing hypotheses of
character evolution, and a research
program that will enable a produc-
tive interchange between linguists
and biologists.
Deﬁning the Target: Two
Senses of the Faculty of
Language
The word “language” has highly divergent
meanings in different contexts and disci-
plines. In informal usage, a language is un-
derstood as a culturally specific communica-
tion system (English, Navajo, etc.). In the
varieties of modern linguistics that concern
us here, the term “language” is used quite
differently to refer to an internal component
of the mind/brain (sometimes called “internal
language” or “I-language”). We assume that
this is the primary object of interest for the
study of the evolution and function of the
language faculty. However, this biologically
and individually grounded usage still leaves
much open to interpretation (and misunder-
standing).
For
example,
a
neuroscientist
might ask: What components of the human
nervous system are recruited in the use of
language in its broadest sense? Because any
aspect of cognition appears to be, at least in
principle, accessible to language, the broadest
answer to this question is, probably, “most of
it.” Even aspects of emotion or cognition not
readily verbalized may be influenced by lin-
guistically based thought processes. Thus,
this conception is too broad to be of much
use. We therefore delineate two more restrict-
ed conceptions of the faculty of language, one
broader and more inclusive, the other more
restricted and narrow (Fig. 2).
Faculty of language— broad sense
(FLB). FLB includes an internal computa-
tional system (FLN, below) combined with
at least two other organism-internal sys-
Fig. 2. A schematic representation of organism-external and -internal factors related to the faculty of language.
FLB includes sensory-motor, conceptual-intentional, and other possible systems (which we leave open); FLN
includes the core grammatical computations that we suggest are limited to recursion. See text for more
complete discussion.

tems, which we call “sensory-motor” and
“conceptual-intentional.” Despite debate on
the precise nature of these systems, and
about whether they are substantially shared
with other vertebrates or uniquely adapted
to the exigencies of language, we take as
uncontroversial the existence of some bio-
logical capacity of humans that allows us
(and not, for example, chimpanzees) to
readily master any human language without
explicit instruction. FLB includes this ca-
pacity, but excludes other organism-
internal systems that are necessary but not
sufficient for language (e.g., memory, res-
piration, digestion, circulation, etc.).
Faculty
of
language—narrow
sense
(FLN). FLN is the abstract linguistic compu-
tational system alone, independent of the oth-
er systems with which it interacts and inter-
faces. FLN is a component of FLB, and the
mechanisms underlying it are some subset of
those underlying FLB.
Others have agreed on the need for a
restricted sense of “language” but have sug-
gested different delineations. For example,
Liberman and his associates (8) have argued
that the sensory-motor systems were specifi-
cally adapted for language, and hence should
be considered part of FLN. There is also a
long tradition holding that the conceptual-
intentional systems are an intrinsic part of
language in a narrow sense. In this article, we
leave these questions open, restricting atten-
tion to FLN as just defined but leaving the
possibility of a more inclusive definition
open to further empirical research.
The internal architecture of FLN, so con-
ceived, is a topic of much current research
and debate (4). Without prejudging the is-
sues, we will, for concreteness, adopt a par-
ticular conception of this architecture. We
assume, putting aside the precise mecha-
nisms, that a key component of FLN is a
computational system (narrow syntax) that
generates internal representations and maps
them into the sensory-motor interface by the
phonological system, and into the conceptu-
al-intentional interface by the (formal) se-
mantic system; adopting alternatives that
have been proposed would not materially
modify the ensuing discussion. All approach-
es agree that a core property of FLN is recur-
sion, attributed to narrow syntax in the con-
ception just outlined. FLN takes a finite set of
elements and yields a potentially infinite ar-
ray of discrete expressions. This capacity of
FLN yields discrete infinity (a property that
also characterizes the natural numbers). Each
of these discrete expressions is then passed to
the sensory-motor and conceptual-intentional
systems, which process and elaborate this
information in the use of language. Each
expression is, in this sense, a pairing of sound
and meaning. It has been recognized for thou-
sands of years that language is, fundamental-
ly, a system of sound-meaning connections;
the potential infiniteness of this system has
been explicitly recognized by Galileo, Des-
cartes, and the 17th-century “philosophical
grammarians” and their successors, notably
von Humboldt. One goal of the study of FLN
and, more broadly, FLB is to discover just
how the faculty of language satisfies these
basic and essential conditions.
The core property of discrete infinity is
intuitively familiar to every language user.
Sentences are built up of discrete units: There
are 6-word sentences and 7-word sentences,
but no 6.5-word sentences. There is no long-
est sentence (any candidate sentence can be
trumped by, for example, embedding it in
“Mary thinks that . . .”), and there is no non-
arbitrary upper bound to sentence length. In
these respects, language is directly analogous
to the natural numbers (see below).
At a minimum, then, FLN includes the ca-
pacity of recursion. There are many organism-
internal factors, outside FLN or FLB, that im-
pose practical limits on the usage of the system.
For example, lung capacity imposes limits on
the length of actual spoken sentences, whereas
working memory imposes limits on the com-
plexity of sentences if they are to be under-
standable. Other limitations—for example, on
concept formation or motor output speed—
represent aspects of FLB, which have their own
evolutionary histories and may have played a
role in the evolution of the capacities of FLN.
Nonetheless, one can profitably inquire into the
evolution of FLN without an
immediate concern for these
limiting aspects of FLB. This
is made clear by the observa-
tion
that,
although
many
aspects of FLB are shared
with other vertebrates, the
core recursive aspect of FLN
currently appears to lack any
analog in animal communi-
cation and possibly other do-
mains as well. This point,
therefore,
represents
the
deepest challenge for a com-
parative
evolutionary
ap-
proach to language. We be-
lieve that investigations of
this capacity should include
domains other than commu-
nication (e.g., number, social
relationships, navigation).
Given
the
distinctions
between FLB and FLN and
the theoretical distinctions
raised above, we can define
a research space as sketched
in Fig. 3. This research
space identifies, as viable,
problems
concerning
the
evolution of sensory-motor
systems, of conceptual-in-
tentional systems, and of
FLN. The comparative ap-
proach, to which we turn
next, provides a framework
for
addressing
questions
about each of these com-
ponents of the faculty of
language.
The Comparative
Approach to Language
Evolution
The empirical study of the
evolution of language is be-
set with difficulties. Lin-
guistic behavior does not
fossilize, and a long tradi-
Fig. 3. Investigations into the evolution of the faculty of language
are confronted with a three-dimensional research space that
includes three comparative-evolutionary problems cross-cut by
the core components of the faculty of language. Thus, for each
problem, researchers can investigate details of the sensory-motor
system, the conceptual-intentional system, FLN, and the interfac-
es among these systems.

tion of analysis of fossil skull shape and
cranial endocasts has led to little consensus
about the evolution of language (7, 9). A
more tractable and, we think, powerful ap-
proach to problems of language evolution is
provided by the comparative method, which
uses empirical data from living species to
draw detailed inferences about extinct ances-
tors (3, 10–12). The comparative method was
the primary tool used by Darwin (13, 14) to
analyze evolutionary phenomena and contin-
ues to play a central role throughout modern
evolutionary biology. Although scholars in-
terested in language evolution have often ig-
nored comparative data altogether or focused
narrowly on data from nonhuman primates,
current thinking in neuroscience, molecular
biology, and developmental biology indicates
that many aspects of neural and developmen-
tal function are highly conserved, encourag-
ing the extension of the comparative method
to all vertebrates (and perhaps beyond). For
several reasons, detailed below, we believe
that the comparative method should play a
more central role in future discussions of
language evolution.
An overarching concern in studies of lan-
guage evolution is with whether particular
components
of
the
faculty
of
language
evolved specifically for human language and,
therefore (by extension), are unique to hu-
mans. Logically, the human uniqueness claim
must be based on data indicating an absence
of the trait in nonhuman animals and, to be
taken seriously, requires a substantial body of
relevant comparative data. More concretely,
if the language evolution researcher wishes to
make the claim that a trait evolved uniquely
in humans for the function of language pro-
cessing, data indicating that no other animal
has this particular trait are required.
Although this line of reasoning may ap-
pear obvious, it is surprisingly common for a
trait to be held up as uniquely human before
any appropriate comparative data are avail-
able. A famous example is categorical per-
ception, which when discovered seemed so
finely tuned to the details of human speech as
to constitute a unique human adaptation (15,
16). It was some time before the same under-
lying perceptual discontinuities were discov-
ered in chinchillas and macaques (17, 18),
and even birds (19), leading to the opposite
conclusion that the perceptual basis for cate-
gorical perception is a primitive vertebrate
characteristic that evolved for general audito-
ry processing, as opposed to specific speech
processing. Thus, a basic and logically in-
eliminable role for comparative research on
language evolution is this simple and essen-
tially negative one: A trait present in nonhu-
man animals did not evolve specifically for
human language, although it may be part of
the language faculty and play an intimate role
in language processing. It is possible, of
course, that a trait evolved in nonhuman an-
imals and humans independently, as analogs
rather than homologs. This would preserve
the possibility that the trait evolved for lan-
guage in humans but evolved for some other
reason in the comparative animal group. In
cases where the comparative group is a non-
human primate, and perhaps especially chim-
panzees, the plausibility of this evolutionary
scenario is weaker. In any case, comparative
data are critical to this judgment.
Despite the crucial role of homology in
comparative biology, homologous traits are not
the only relevant source of evolutionary data.
The convergent evolution of similar characters
in two independent clades, termed “analogies”
or “homoplasies,” can be equally revealing
(20). The remarkably similar (but nonhomolo-
gous) structures of human and octopus eyes
reveal the stringent constraints placed by the
laws of optics and the contingencies of devel-
opment on an organ capable of focusing a sharp
image onto a sheet of receptors. Detailed anal-
ogies between the parts of the vertebrate and
cephalopod eye also provide independent evi-
dence that each component is an adaptation for
image formation, shaped by natural selection.
Furthermore, the discovery that remarkably
conservative genetic cascades underlie the de-
velopment of such analogous structures pro-
vides important insights into the ways in
which
developmental
mechanisms
can
channel evolution (21). Thus, although po-
tentially misleading for taxonomists, anal-
ogies provide critical data about adaptation
under physical and developmental con-
straints. Casting the comparative net more
broadly, therefore, will most likely reveal
larger regularities in evolution, helping to
address the role of such constraints in the
evolution of language.
An analogy recognized as particularly rele-
vant to language is the acquisition of song by
birds (12). In contrast to nonhuman primates,
where the production of species-typical vocal-
izations is largely innate (22), most songbirds
learn their species-specific song by listening to
conspecifics, and they develop highly aberrant
song if deprived of such experience. Current
investigation of birdsong reveals detailed and
intriguing parallels with speech (11, 23, 24).
For instance, many songbirds pass through a
critical period in development beyond which
they produce defective songs that no amount of
acoustic input can remedy, reminiscent of the
difficulty adult humans have in fully mastering
new languages. Further, and in parallel with the
babbling phase of vocalizing or signing human
infants (25), young birds pass through a phase
of song development in which they spontane-
ously produce amorphous versions of adult
song, termed “subsong” or “babbling.” Al-
though the mechanisms underlying the acquisi-
tion of birdsong and human language are clear-
ly analogs and not homologs, their core com-
ponents share a deeply conserved neural and
developmental foundation: Most aspects of
neurophysiology and development—including
regulatory and structural genes, as well as neu-
ron types and neurotransmitters—are shared
among vertebrates. That such close parallels
have evolved suggests the existence of impor-
tant constraints on how vertebrate brains can
acquire large vocabularies of complex, learned
sounds. Such constraints may essentially force
natural selection to come up with the same
solution repeatedly when confronted with sim-
ilar problems.
Testing Hypotheses About the
Evolution of the Faculty of Language
Given the definitions of the faculty of lan-
guage, together with the comparative frame-
work, we can distinguish several plausible
hypotheses about the evolution of its various
components. Here, we suggest two hypothe-
ses that span the diversity of opinion among
current scholars, plus a third of our own.
Hypothesis 1: FLB is strictly homologous
to animal communication. This hypothesis
holds that homologs of FLB, including FLN,
exist (perhaps in less developed or otherwise
modified form) in nonhuman animals (3, 10,
26). This has historically been a popular hy-
pothesis outside of linguistics and closely
allied fields, and has been defended by some
in the speech sciences. According to this
hypothesis, human FLB is composed of the
same functional components that underlie
communication in other species.
Hypothesis 2: FLB is a derived, uniquely
human adaptation for language. According
to this hypothesis, FLB is a highly complex
adaptation for language, on a par with the
vertebrate eye, and many of its core compo-
nents can be viewed as individual traits that
have been subjected to selection and perfect-
ed in recent human evolutionary history. This
appears to represent the null hypothesis for
many scholars who take the complexity of
language seriously (27, 28). The argument
starts with the assumption that FLB, as a
whole, is highly complex, serves the function
of communication with admirable effective-
ness, and has an ineliminable genetic compo-
nent. Because natural selection is the only
known biological mechanism capable of gen-
erating such functional complexes [the argu-
ment from design (29)], proponents of this
view conclude that natural selection has
played a powerful role in shaping many as-
pects of FLB, including FLN, and, further,
that many of these are without parallel in
nonhuman animals. Although homologous
mechanisms may exist in other animals, the
human versions have been modified by nat-
ural selection to the extent that they can be
reasonably seen as constituting novel traits,
perhaps exapted from other contexts [e.g.,
social intelligence, tool-making (7, 30–32)].

Hypothesis 3: Only FLN is uniquely human.
On the basis of data reviewed below, we hy-
pothesize that most, if not all, of FLB is based
on mechanisms shared with nonhuman animals
(as held by hypothesis 1). In contrast, we sug-
gest that FLN—the computational mechanism
of recursion—is recently evolved and unique to
our species (33, 34). According to this hypoth-
esis, much of the complexity manifested in
language derives from complexity in the pe-
ripheral components of FLB, especially those
underlying the sensory-motor (speech or sign)
and conceptual-intentional interfaces, com-
bined with sociocultural and communicative
contingencies. FLB as a whole thus has an
ancient evolutionary history, long predating the
emergence of language, and a comparative
analysis is necessary to understand this com-
plex system. By contrast, according to recent
linguistic theory, the computations underlying
FLN may be quite limited. In fact, we propose
in this hypothesis that FLN comprises only the
core computational mechanisms of recursion as
they appear in narrow syntax and the mappings
to the interfaces. If FLN is indeed this restrict-
ed, this hypothesis has the interesting effect of
nullifying the argument from design, and thus
rendering the status of FLN as an adaptation
open to question. Proponents of the idea that
FLN is an adaptation would thus need to supply
additional data or arguments to support this
viewpoint.
The available comparative data on animal
communication systems suggest that the faculty
of language as a whole relies on some uniquely
human capacities that have evolved recently in
the approximately 6 million years since our
divergence from a chimpanzee-like common
ancestor (35). Hypothesis 3, in its strongest
form, suggests that only FLN falls into this
category (34). By this hypothesis, FLB contains
a wide variety of cognitive and perceptual
mechanisms shared with other species, but only
those mechanisms underlying FLN—particu-
larly its capacity for discrete infinity—are
uniquely human. This hypothesis suggests that
all peripheral components of FLB are shared
with other animals, in more or less the same
form as they exist in humans, with differences
of quantity rather than kind (9, 34). What is
unique to our species is quite specific to FLN,
and includes its internal operations as well as its
interface with the other organism-internal sys-
tems of FLB.
Each of these hypotheses is plausible to
some degree. Ultimately, they can be distin-
guished only by empirical data, much of which
is currently unavailable. Before reviewing some
of the relevant data, we briefly consider some
key distinctions between them. From a compar-
ative evolutionary viewpoint, an important
question is whether linguistic precursors were
involved in communication or in something
else. Proponents of both hypotheses 1 and 2
posit a direct correspondence, by descent with
modification, between some trait involved in
FLB in humans and a similar trait in another
species; these hypotheses differ in whether
the precursors functioned in communication.

Although many aspects of FLB very likely
arose in this manner, the important issue for
these hypotheses is whether a series of gradual
modifications could lead eventually to the ca-
pacity of language for infinite generativity. De-
spite the inarguable existence of a broadly
shared base of homologous mechanisms in-
volved in FLB, minor modifications to this
foundational system alone seem inadequate to
generate the fundamental difference—discrete
infinity—between language and all known
forms of animal communication. This claim is
one of several reasons why we suspect that
hypothesis 3 may be a productive way to char-
acterize the problem of language evolution.
A primary issue separating hypotheses 2
and 3 is whether the uniquely human capac-
ities of FLN constitute an adaptation. The
viewpoint stated in hypothesis 2, especially
the notion that FLN in particular is a highly
evolved adaptation, has generated much en-
thusiasm recently [e.g., (36)], especially
among evolutionary psychologists (37, 38).
At present, however, we see little reason to
believe either that FLN can be anatomized
into many independent but interacting traits,
each with its own independent evolutionary
history, or that each of these traits could have
been strongly shaped by natural selection,
given their tenuous connection to communi-
cative efficacy (the surface or phenotypic
function upon which selection presumably
acted).
We consider the possibility that certain spe-
cific aspects of the faculty of language are
“spandrels”—by-products of preexisting con-
straints rather than end products of a history of
natural selection (39). This possibility, which
opens the door to other empirical lines of inqui-
ry, is perfectly compatible with our firm support
of the adaptationist program. Indeed, it follows
directly from the foundational notion that adap-
tation is an “onerous concept” to be invoked
only when alternative explanations fail (40).
The question is not whether FLN in toto is
adaptive. By allowing us to communicate an
endless variety of thoughts, recursion is clearly
an adaptive computation. The question is
whether particular components of the function-
ing of FLN are adaptations for language, spe-
cifically acted upon by natural selection—or,
even more broadly, whether FLN evolved for
reasons other than communication.
An analogy may make this distinction
clear. The trunk and branches of trees are
near-optimal solutions for providing an indi-
vidual tree’s leaves with access to sunlight.
For shrubs and small trees, a wide variety of
forms (spreading, spherical, multistalked,
etc.) provide good solutions to this problem.
For a towering rainforest canopy tree, how-
ever, most of these forms are rendered im-
possible by the various constraints imposed
by the properties of cellulose and the prob-
lems of sucking water and nutrients up to the
leaves high in the air. Some aspects of such
trees are clearly adaptations channeled by
these constraints; others (e.g., the popping of
xylem tubes on hot days, the propensity to be
toppled in hurricanes) are presumably un-
avoidable by-products of such constraints.
Recent work on FLN (4, 41–43) suggests
the possibility that at least the narrow-syntactic
component satisfies conditions of highly effi-
cient computation to an extent previously unsus-
pected. Thus, FLN may approximate a kind of
“optimal solution” to the problem of linking
the sensory-motor and conceptual-intentional
systems. In other words, the generative process-
es of the language system may provide a
near-optimal solution that satisfies the interface
conditions to FLB. Many of the details of lan-
guage that are the traditional focus of linguistic
study [e.g., subjacency, Wh- movement, the
existence of garden-path sentences (4, 44)] may
represent by-products of this solution, gener-
ated automatically by neural/computational
constraints and the structure of FLB—
components that lie outside of FLN. Even
novel capacities such as recursion are imple-
mented in the same type of neural tissue as the
rest of the brain and are thus constrained by
biophysical, developmental, and computation-
al factors shared with other vertebrates. Hy-
pothesis 3 raises the possibility that structural
details of FLN may result from such preexisting
constraints, rather than from direct shaping by
natural selection targeted specifically at com-
munication. Insofar as this proves to be true,
such structural details are not, strictly speaking,
adaptations at all. This hypothesis and the
alternative selectionist account are both viable
and can eventually be tested with comparative
data.
Comparative Evidence for the Faculty
of Language
Study of the evolution of language has accel-
erated in the past decade (45, 46). Here, we
offer a highly selective review of some of
these studies, emphasizing animal work that
seems particularly relevant to the hypotheses
advanced above; many omissions were nec-
essary for reasons of space, and we firmly
believe that a broad diversity of methods and
perspectives will ultimately provide the rich-
est answers to the problem of language evo-
lution. For this reason, we present a broader
sampler of the field’s offerings in Table 1.
How “special” is speech? Comparative
study of the sensory-motor system. Starting with
early work on speech perception, there has been
a tradition of considering speech “special,” and
thus based on uniquely human mechanisms
adapted for speech perception and/or produc-
tion [e.g., (7, 8, 47, 48)]. This perspective has
stimulated a vigorous research program study-
ing animal speech perception and, more recent-
ly, speech production. Surprisingly, this re-
search has turned up little evidence for uniquely
human mechanisms special to speech, despite a
persistent tendency to assume uniqueness even
in the absence of relevant animal data.
On the side of perception, for example,
many species show an impressive ability to
both discriminate between and generalize
over human speech sounds, using formants as
the critical discriminative cue (17–19, 49–
51). These data provide evidence not only of
categorical perception, but also of the ability
to discriminate among prototypical exem-
plars of different phonemes (52). Further, in
the absence of training, nonhuman primates
can discriminate sentences from two different
languages on the basis of rhythmic differenc-
es between them (53).
On the side of production, birds and non-
human primates naturally produce and per-
ceive formants in their own species-typical
vocalizations (54–59). The results also shed
light on discussions of the uniquely human
structure of the vocal tract and the unusual
descended larynx of our species (7, 48, 60),
because new evidence shows that several oth-
er mammalian species also have a descended
larynx (61). Because these nonhuman species
lack speech, a descended larynx clearly has
nonphonetic functions; one possibility is ex-
aggerating apparent size. Although this par-
ticular anatomical modification undoubtedly
plays an important role in speech production
in modern humans, it need not have first
evolved for this function. The descended lar-
ynx may thus be an example of classic Dar-
winian preadaptation.
Many phenomena in human speech percep-
tion have not yet been investigated in animals
[e.g., the McGurk effect, an illusion in which
the syllable perceived from a talking head rep-
resents the interaction between an articulatory
gesture seen and a different syllable heard; see
(62)]. However, the available data suggest a
much stronger continuity between animals and
humans with respect to speech than previously
believed. We argue that the continuity hypoth-
esis thus deserves the status of a null hypothe-
sis, which must be rejected by comparative
work before any claims of uniqueness can be
validated. For now, this null hypothesis of no
truly novel traits in the speech domain appears
to stand.
There is, however, a striking ability tied to
speech that has received insufficient atten-
tion: the human capacity for vocal imitation
(63, 64). Imitation is obviously a necessary
component of the human capacity to acquire
a shared and arbitrary lexicon, which is itself
central to the language capacity. Thus, the
capacity to imitate was a crucial prerequisite
of FLB as a communicative system. Vocal
imitation and learning are not uniquely hu-
man. Rich multimodal imitative capacities
are seen in other mammals (dolphins) and
some birds (parrots), with most songbirds
exhibiting a well-developed vocal imitative

capacity (65). What is surprising is that mon-
keys show almost no evidence of visually
mediated imitation, with chimpanzees show-
ing only slightly better capacities (66). Even
more striking is the virtual absence of evi-
dence for vocal imitation in either monkeys
or apes (3). For example, intensively trained
chimpanzees are incapable of acquiring any-
thing but a few poorly articulated spoken
words, whereas parrots can readily acquire a
large vocal repertoire. With respect to their
own vocalizations, there are few convincing
studies of vocal dialects in primates, thereby
suggesting that they lack a vocal imitative
capacity (3, 65). Evidence for spontaneous
visuomanual imitation in chimpanzees is not
much stronger, although with persistent train-
ing they can learn several hundred hand
signs. Further, even in cases where
nonhuman animals are capable of im-
itating in one modality (e.g., song
copying in songbirds), only dolphins
and humans appear capable of imita-
tion in multiple modalities. The de-
tachment from modality-specific in-
puts may represent a substantial
change in neural organization, one
that affects not only imitation but
also communication; only humans
can lose one modality (e.g., hear-
ing) and make up for this deficit by
communicating with complete com-
petence in a different modality (i.e.,
signing).
Our discussion of limitations is
not meant to diminish the impressive
achievements of monkeys and apes,
but to highlight how different the
mechanisms underlying the produc-
tion of human and nonhuman primate
gestures, either vocally expressed or
signed, must be. After all, the aver-
age high school graduate knows up to
60,000 words, a vocabulary achieved
with little effort, especially when
contrasted with the herculean efforts
devoted to training animals. In sum,
the impressive ability of any normal
human child for vocal imitation may
represent
a
novel
capacity
that
evolved in our recent evolutionary
history, some time after the diver-
gence from our chimpanzee-like an-
cestors. The existence of analogs in
distantly related species, such as
birds and cetaceans, suggests consid-
erable potential for the detailed com-
parative study of vocal imitation. There are,
however, potential traps that must be avoid-
ed, especially with respect to explorations of
the neurobiological substrates of imitation.
For example, although macaque monkeys
and humans are equipped with so-called
“mirror neurons” in the premotor cortex that
respond both when an individual acts in a
particular way and when the same individual
sees someone else act in this same way (67,
68), these neurons are not sufficient for imi-
tation in macaques, as many have presumed:
As mentioned, there is no convincing evi-
dence of vocal or visual imitation in mon-
keys. Consequently, as neuroimaging studies
continue to explore the neural basis of imita-
tion in humans (69–71), it will be important
to distinguish between the necessary and suf-
ficient neural correlates of imitation. This is
especially important, given that some recent
attempts to model the evolution of language
begin with a hypothetical organism that is
equipped with the capacity for imitation and
intentionality, as opposed to working out how
these mechanisms evolved in the first place
[see below; (72–74)]. If a deeper evolution-
ary exploration is desired, one dating back to
a chimpanzee-like ancestor, then we need to
explain
how
and
why
such
capacities
emerged from an ancestral node that lacked
such abilities (75) (Fig. 4).
The conceptual-intentional systems of non-
linguistic animals. A wide variety of studies
indicate that nonhuman mammals and birds
have rich conceptual representations (76, 77).
Surprisingly, however, there is a mismatch be-
tween the conceptual capacities of animals and
the communicative content of their vocal and
visual signals (78, 79). For example, although a
wide variety of nonhuman primates have access
to rich knowledge of who is related to whom, as
well as who is dominant and who is subordi-
nate, their vocalizations only coarsely express
such complexities.
Studies using classical training approach-
es as well as methods that tap spontaneous
abilities reveal that animals acquire and use a
wide range of abstract concepts, including
tool, color, geometric relationships, food, and
number (66, 76–82). More controversially,
but of considerable relevance to intentional
aspects of language and conditions of felici-
tous use, some studies claim that animals
have a theory of mind (83–85), including a
sense of self and the ability to represent the
beliefs and desires of other group members.
On the side of positive support, recent studies
of chimpanzees suggest that they recognize
the perceptual act of seeing as a proxy for the
mental state of knowing (84, 86, 87). These
Fig. 4. The distribution of imitation in the animal kingdom is patchy. Some animals such as songbirds,
dolphins, and humans have evolved exceptional abilities to imitate; other animals, such as apes and
monkeys, either lack such abilities or have them in a relatively impoverished form. [Illustration: John Yanson]

studies suggest that at least chimpanzees, but
perhaps no other nonhuman animals, have a
rudimentary theory of mind. On the side of
negative support, other studies suggest that
even chimpanzees lack a theory of mind,
failing, for example, to differentiate between
ignorant and knowledgeable individuals with
respect to intentional communication (88,
89). Because these experiments make use of
different methods and are based on small
sample sizes, it is not possible at present to
derive any firm conclusions about the pres-
ence or absence of mental state attribution in
animals. Independently of how this contro-
versy is resolved, however, the best evidence
of referential communication in animals
comes not from chimpanzees but from a va-
riety of monkeys and birds, species for which
there is no convincing evidence for a theory
of mind.
The classic studies of vervet monkey
alarm calls (90) have now been joined by
several others, each using comparable meth-
ods, with extensions to different species (ma-
caques, Diana monkeys, meerkats, prairie
dogs, chickens) and different communicative
contexts (social relationships, food, inter-
group aggression) (91–97). From these stud-
ies we can derive five key points relevant to
our analysis of the faculty of language. First,
individuals produce acoustically distinctive
calls in response to functionally important
contexts, including the detection of predators
and the discovery of food. Second, the acous-
tic morphology of the signal, although arbi-
trary in terms of its association with a partic-
ular context, is sufficient to enable listeners to
respond appropriately without requiring any
other contextual information. Third, the num-
ber of such signals in the repertoire is small,
restricted to objects and events experienced
in the present, with no evidence of creative
production of new sounds for new situations.
Fourth, the acoustic morphology of the calls
is fixed, appearing early in development, with
experience only playing a role in refining the
range of objects or events that elicit such
calls. Fifth, there is no evidence that calling is
intentional in the sense of taking into account
what other individuals believe or want.
Early interpretations of this work suggest-
ed that when animals vocalize, they are func-
tionally referring to the objects and events
that they have encountered. As such, vervet
alarm calls and rhesus monkey food calls, to
take two examples, were interpreted as word-
like, with callers referring to different kinds
of predators or different kinds of food. More
recent discussions have considerably weak-
ened this interpretation, suggesting that if the
signal is referential at all, it is in the mind of
the listener who can extract information
about the signaler’s current context from the
acoustic structure of the call alone (78, 95).
Despite this evidence that animals can extract
information from the signal, there are several
reasons why additional evidence is required
before such signals can be considered as pre-
cursors for, or homologs of, human words.
Roughly speaking, we can think of a partic-
ular human language as consisting of words and
computational procedures (“rules”) for con-
structing expressions from them. The computa-
tional system has the recursive property briefly
outlined earlier, which may be a distinct human
property. However, key aspects of words may
also be distinctively human. There are, first of
all, qualitative differences in scale and mode of
acquisition, which suggest that quite different
mechanisms are involved; as pointed out above,
there is no evidence for vocal imitation in non-
human primates, and although human children
may use domain-general mechanisms to ac-
quire and recall words (98, 99), the rate at
which children build the lexicon is so massively
different from nonhuman primates that one
must entertain the possibility of an indepen-
dently evolved mechanism. Further-
more, unlike the best animal exam-
ples of putatively referential signals,
most of the words of human lan-
guage are not associated with specif-
ic functions (e.g., warning cries, food
announcements) but can be linked to
virtually any concept that humans
can entertain. Such usages are often
highly intricate and detached from
the here and now. Even for the sim-
plest words, there is typically no
straightforward word-thing relation-
ship, if “thing” is to be understood in
mind-independent
terms.
Without
pursuing the matter here, it appears
that many of the elementary proper-
ties of words—including those that
enter into referentiality—have only
weak analogs or homologs in natural
animal communication systems, with
only slightly better evidence from the
training studies with apes and dol-
phins. Future research must therefore
provide stronger support for the pre-
cursor position, or it must instead
abandon this hypothesis, arguing that
this component of FLB (conceptual-
intentional) is also uniquely human.
Discrete infinity and constraints
on learning. The data summarized thus far,
although far from complete, provide overall
support for the position of continuity between
humans and other animals in terms of FLB.
However, we have not yet addressed one
issue that many regard as lying at the heart of
language: its capacity for limitless expressive
power, captured by the notion of discrete
infinity. It seems relatively clear, after nearly
a century of intensive research on animal
communication, that no species other than
humans has a comparable capacity to recom-
bine meaningful units into an unlimited vari-
ety of larger structures, each differing sys-
tematically
in
meaning.
However,
little
progress has been made in identifying the
specific capabilities that are lacking in other
animals.
Fig. 5. Human and nonhuman animals exhibit the capacity to compute numerosities, including small precise
number quantiﬁcation and large approximate number estimation. Humans may be unique, however, in the ability
to show open-ended, precise quantiﬁcational skills with large numbers, including the integer count list. In parallel
with the faculty of language, our capacity for number relies on a recursive computation. [Illustration: John Yanson]

The astronomical variety of sentences any
natural language user can produce and under-
stand has an important implication for lan-
guage acquisition, long a core issue in devel-
opmental psychology. A child is exposed to
only a small proportion of the possible sen-
tences in its language, thus limiting its data-
base for constructing a more general version
of that language in its own mind/brain. This
point has logical implications for any system
that attempts to acquire a natural language on
the basis of limited data. It is immediately
obvious that given a finite array of data, there
are infinitely many theories consistent with it
but inconsistent with one another. In the
present case, there are in principle infinitely
many target systems (potential I-languages)
consistent with the data of experience, and
unless the search space and acquisition mech-
anisms are constrained, selection among
them is impossible. A version of the problem
has been formalized by Gold (100) and more
recently and rigorously explored by Nowak
and colleagues (72–75). No known “general
learning mechanism” can acquire a natural
language solely on the basis of positive or
negative evidence, and the prospects for find-
ing any such domain-independent device
seem rather dim. The difficulty of this prob-
lem leads to the hypothesis that whatever
system is responsible must be biased or con-
strained in certain ways. Such constraints
have historically been termed “innate dispo-
sitions,” with those underlying language re-
ferred to as “universal grammar.” Although
these particular terms have been forcibly re-
jected by many researchers, and the nature of
the particular constraints on human (or ani-
mal) learning mechanisms is currently unre-
solved, the existence of some such con-
straints cannot be seriously doubted. On the
other hand, other constraints in animals must
have been overcome at some point in human
evolution to account for our ability to acquire
the unlimited class of generative systems that
includes all natural languages. The nature of
these latter constraints has recently become
the target of empirical work. We focus here
on the nature of number representation and
rule learning in nonhuman animals and hu-
man infants, both of which can be investigat-
ed independently of communication and pro-
vide hints as to the nature of the constraints
on FLN.
More than 50 years of research using clas-
sical training studies demonstrates that ani-
mals can represent number, with careful con-
trols for various important confounds (80). In
the typical experiment, a rat or pigeon is
trained to press a lever x number of times to
obtain a food reward. Results show that ani-
mals can hit the target number to within a
closely matched mean, with a standard devi-
ation that increases with magnitude: As the
target number increases, so does variation
around the mean. These results have led to
the idea that animals, including human in-
fants and adults, can represent number ap-
proximately as a magnitude with scalar vari-
ability (101, 102). Number discrimination is
limited in this system by Weber’s law, with
greater discriminability among small num-
bers than among large numbers (keeping dis-
tances between pairs constant) and between
numbers that are farther apart (e.g., 7 versus
8 is harder than 7 versus 12). The approxi-
mate number sense is accompanied by a sec-
ond precise mechanism that is limited to val-
ues less than 4 but accurately distinguishes 1
from 2, 2 from 3, and 3 from 4; this second
system appears to be recruited in the context
of object tracking and is limited by working
memory constraints (103). Of direct rele-
vance to the current discussion, animals can
be trained to understand the meaning of num-
ber words or Arabic numeral symbols. How-
ever, these studies reveal striking differences
in how animals and human children acquire
the integer list, and provide further evidence
that animals lack the capacity to create open-
ended generative systems.
Boysen
and
Matsuzawa
have
trained
chimpanzees to map the number of objects
onto a single Arabic numeral, to correctly
order such numerals in either an ascending or
descending list, and to indicate the sums of
two numerals (104–106). For example, Boy-
sen shows that a chimpanzee seeing two or-
anges placed in one box, and another two
oranges placed in a second box, will pick the
correct sum of four out of a lineup of three
cards, each with a different Arabic numeral.
The chimpanzees’ performance might sug-
gest that their representation of number is like
ours. Closer inspection of how these chim-
panzees acquired such competences, howev-
er, indicates that the format and content of
their number representations differ funda-
mentally from those of human children. In
particular, these chimpanzees required thou-
sands of training trials, and often years, to
acquire the integer list up to nine, with no
evidence of the kind of “aha” experience that
all human children of approximately 3.5
years acquire (107). A human child who has
acquired the numbers 1, 2, and 3 (and some-
times 4) goes on to acquire all the others; he
or she grasps the idea that the integer list is
constructed on the basis of the successor
function. For the chimpanzees, in contrast,
each number on the integer list required the
same amount of time to learn. In essence,
although the chimpanzees’ understanding of
Arabic numerals is impressive, it parallels
their understanding of other symbols and
their referential properties: The system appar-
ently never takes on the open-ended genera-
tive property of human language. This limi-
tation may, however, reveal an interesting
quirk of the child’s learning environment and
a difference from the training regime of ani-
mals: Children typically first learn an arbi-
trary ordered list of symbols (“1, 2, 3, 4 . . . ”)
and later learn the precise meaning of such
words; apes and parrots, in contrast, were
taught the meanings one by one without
learning the list. As Carey (103) has argued,
this may represent a fundamental difference
in experience, a hypothesis that could be
tested by first training animals with an arbi-
trary ordered list.
A second possible limitation on the class
of learnable structures concerns the kinds of
statistical inferences that animals can com-
pute. Early work in computational linguistics
(108–110) suggested that we can profitably
think about language as a system of rules
placed within a hierarchy of increasing com-
plexity. At the lowest level of the hierarchy
are rule systems that are limited to local
dependencies, a subcategory of so-called
“finite-state grammars.” Despite their attrac-
tive simplicity, such rule systems are inade-
quate to capture any human language. Natu-
ral languages go beyond purely local struc-
ture by including a capacity for recursive
embedding of phrases within phrases, which
can lead to statistical regularities that are
separated by an arbitrary number of words or
phrases. Such long-distance, hierarchical re-
lationships are found in all natural languages
for which, at a minimum, a “phrase-structure
grammar” is necessary. It is a foundational
observation of modern generative linguistics
that, to capture a natural language, a grammar
must include such capabilities (Fig. 5).
Recent studies suggest that the capacity to
compute transitional probabilities—an exam-
ple of a rule at the lowest level of the hierar-
chy—might be available to human infants
and provide a mechanism for segmenting
words from a continuous acoustic stream
(111–113). Specifically, after familiarization
to a continuous sequence of consonant-vowel
(CV) syllables, where particular trigrams
(three CVs in sequence, considered to be
“words” in this context) have a high proba-
bility of appearing within the corpus, infants
are readily able to discriminate these tri-
grams from others that are uncommon.
Although this ability may provide a mech-
anism for word segmentation, it is appar-
ently not a mechanism that evolved unique-
ly in humans or for language: The same
computation is spontaneously available to
human infants for visual sequences and
tonal melodies (113), as well as to nonhu-
man primates (cotton-top tamarins) tested
with the same methods and stimuli (114).
Similarly, in the same way that human
infants appear capable of computing alge-
braic rules that operate over particular CV
sequences (115), so too can cotton-top
tamarins (116), again demonstrating that
the capacity to discover abstract rules at a

local level is not unique to humans, and
almost certainly did not evolve specifically
for language.
Fitch and Hauser (117) recently complet-
ed a study comparing finite-state and phrase-
structure
grammar
acquisition
in
human
adults and tamarins, using the same subjects
and methods as the studies above. The
phrase-structure rule tested was AnBn, where
A and B were each represented by one of a
set of eight different CVs. The rule therefore
specified both a set of consistent strings (n
A’s must precede n B’s) and a set of incon-
sistent strings; the latter consisted of viola-
tions of order (B tokens precede A tokens) or
of patterning (alternations of A’s and B’s
such as ABAB). Results showed that human
adults rapidly learned this rule implicitly,
distinguishing consistent and inconsistent
strings. Tamarins, in contrast, failed in three
separate experiments testing their ability to
acquire
this
grammar,
but
they
readily
mastered a finite-state variant (ABn) imple-
mented with the same stimuli and testing
conditions. This suggests that tamarins have a
limited capacity to learn the type of long-
distance hierarchical dependencies necessary
to achieve the class of phrase-structure gram-
mars. If true, this limitation would place se-
vere restrictions on their capacity to learn any
natural human language. It is currently un-
clear whether this limitation generalizes to
other animals, and whether it is similarly
imposed on humans at different stages of
development. Nonetheless, such experiments
provide an empirical approach to exploring
key differences between humans and animals
relevant to FLN.
Our review has stressed the usefulness
of animal data for theories about humans,
but this exchange need not be one-way. As
the research program we have sketched
progresses, more general principles about
cognitive evolution may emerge. For exam-
ple, suppose we adopt the conception of
hypothesis
3,
oversimplifying
radically,
that the interface systems—sensory-motor
and conceptual-intentional—are given, and
the innovation that yielded the faculty of
language was the evolution of the compu-
tational system that links them. The com-
putational system must (i) construct an in-
finite array of internal expressions from the
finite resources of the conceptual-intention-
al system, and (ii) provide the means to
externalize and interpret them at the senso-
ry-motor end. We may now ask to what
extent the computational system is optimal,
meeting
natural
conditions
of
efficient
computation such as minimal search and no
backtracking. To the extent that this can be
established, we will be able to go beyond
the (extremely difficult, and still distant)
accomplishment of finding the principles of
the faculty of language, to an understanding
of why the faculty follows these particular
principles and not others. We would then
understand why languages of a certain class
are attainable, whereas other imaginable
languages are impossible to learn and sus-
tain. Such progress would not only open the
door to a greatly simplified and empirically
more tractable evolutionary approach to the
faculty of language, but might also be more
generally applicable to domains beyond
language in a wide range of species—per-
haps especially in the domain of spatial
navigation and foraging, where problems of
optimal search are relevant. For example,
elegant studies of insects, birds, and pri-
mates reveal that individuals often search
for food by an optimal strategy, one involv-
ing minimal distances, recall of locations
searched, and kinds of objects retrieved
(77, 118, 119). Only after a concerted, mul-
tidisciplinary attack on the problems of
language evolution, paralleling 40 years of
optimal foraging research, will we learn
whether such similarities are more than
superficial.
Conclusions
We conclude by making three points. First, a
practical matter: Linguists and biologists,
along with researchers in the relevant branch-
es of psychology and anthropology, can
move beyond unproductive theoretical debate
to a more collaborative, empirically focused
and comparative research program aimed at
uncovering both shared (homologous or anal-
ogous) and unique components of the faculty
of language. Second, although we have ar-
gued that most if not all of FLB is shared with
other species, whereas FLN may be unique to
humans, this represents a tentative, testable
hypothesis in need of further empirical inves-
tigation. Finally, we believe that a compara-
tive approach is most likely to lead to new
insights about both shared and derived fea-
tures, thereby generating new hypotheses
concerning the evolutionary forces that led to
the design of the faculty of language. Specif-
ically, although we have said relatively little
about the role of natural selection in shaping
the design features of FLN, we suggest that
by considering the possibility that FLN
evolved for reasons other than language, the
comparative door has been opened in a new
and (we think) exciting way.
Comparative work has generally focused
on animal communication or the capacity to
acquire a human-created language. If, how-
ever, one entertains the hypothesis that recur-
sion evolved to solve other computational
problems such as navigation, number quanti-
fication, or social relationships, then it is
possible that other animals have such abili-
ties, but our research efforts have been tar-
geted at an overly narrow search space (Fig.
3). If we find evidence for recursion in ani-
mals, but in a noncommunicative domain,
then we are more likely to pinpoint the mech-
anisms underlying this ability and the selec-
tive pressures that led to it. This discovery, in
turn, would open the door to another suite of
puzzles: Why did humans, but no other ani-
mal, take the power of recursion to create an
open-ended and limitless system of commu-
nication? Why does our system of recursion
operate over a broader range of elements or
inputs (e.g., numbers, words) than other ani-
mals? One possibility, consistent with current
thinking in the cognitive sciences, is that
recursion in animals represents a modular
system designed for a particular function
(e.g., navigation) and impenetrable with re-
spect to other systems. During evolution, the
modular and highly domain-specific system
of recursion may have become penetrable and
domain-general. This opened the way for hu-
mans, perhaps uniquely, to apply the power
of recursion to other problems. This change
from domain-specific to domain-general may
have been guided by particular selective pres-
sures, unique to our evolutionary past, or as a
consequence (by-product) of other kinds of
neural reorganization. Either way, these are
testable hypotheses, a refrain that highlights
the importance of comparative approaches to
the faculty of language.
