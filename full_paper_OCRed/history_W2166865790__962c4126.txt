ABSTRACT
Molecular structures and sequences are gen-
erally more revealing of evolutionary relationships than are
classical phenotypes (particularly so among microorganisms).
Consequently, the basis for the definition of taxa has progres-
sively shifted from the organismal to the cellular to the molec-
ular level. Molecular comparisons show that life on this planet
divides into three primary groupings, commonly known as the
eubacteria, the archaebacteria, and the eukaryotes. The three
are very dissimilar, the differences that separate them being of
a more profound nature than the differences that separate
typical kingdoms, such as animals and plants. Unfortunately,
neither of the conventionally accepted views of the natural
relationships among living systems-i.e., the five-kingdom
taxonomy or the eukaryote-prokaryote dichotomy-reflects
this primary tripartite division of the living world. To remedy
this situation we propose that a formal system of organisms be
established in which above the level of kingdom there exists a
new taxon called a "domain." Life on this planet would then
be seen as comprising three domains, the Bacteria, the Ar-
chaea, and the Eucarya, each containing two or more king-
doms. (The Eucarya, for example, contain Animalia, Plantae,
Fungi, and a number of others yet to be defined.) Although
taxonomic structure within the Bacteria and Eucarya is not
treated herein, Archaea is formally subdivided into the two
kingdoms Euryarchaeota (encompassing the methanogens and
their phenotypically diverse relatives) and Crenarchaeota
(comprising the relatively tight clustering of extremely ther-
mophilic archaebacteria, whose general phenotype appears to
resemble most the ancestral phenotype of the Archaea).
Need for Restructuring Systematics
Within the last decade
it has become possible to trace
evolutionary history back to the (most recent) common
ancestor of all life, perhaps 3.5-4 billion years ago (1, 2).
Prior to the mid 1970s evolutionary study had for all intents
and purposes been confined to the metazoa and metaphyta,
whose histories at best cover 20% of the total evolutionary
time span. A sound basis for a natural taxonomy was pro-
vided in these cases by complex morphologies and a detailed
fossil record. The evolution of the microbial world-whose
history spans most ofthe planet's existence-was at that time
beyond the biologist's purview, for, unlike their multicellular
equivalents, microbial morphologies and other characteris-
tics are too simple or uninterpretable to serve as the basis for
a phylogenetically valid taxonomy (3, 4). The sequencing
revolution, by making accessible the vast store of historical
information contained in molecular sequences (5), has
changed all that. As a result, the biologist finds that textbook
descriptions of the basic organization of life have become
outmoded and so, misleading. The time has come to bring
formal taxonomy into line with the natural system emerging
from molecular data.
This revision, however, is not accomplished simply by
emending the old system. Our present view of the basic
organization of life is still largely steeped in the ancient notion
that all living things are either plant or animal in nature.
Unfortunately, this comfortable traditional dichotomy does
not represent the true state of affairs. Thus, as a prerequisite
to developing a proper natural system we have to divest
ourselves of deeply ingrained, cherished assumptions, as
regards both the fundamental organization of life and the
basis for constructing a system of organisms. The system we
develop will be one that is completely restructured at the
highest levels.
Haeckel in 1866 (6) formally challenged the aboriginal
plant/animal division of the living world. He recognized that
the single-celled forms, the protists, did not fit into either
category; they must have arisen separately from both animals
and plants. Haeckel saw the tree of life, therefore, as having
three main branches, not two. Copeland (7) later split out a
fourth main branch, a new kingdom accommodating the
bacteria, and Whittaker (8) created a fifth, for the fungi.
While Haeckel's original proposal and its two more recent
refinements did away with the idea that animal/plant was the
primary distinction, they left unchallenged the notion that it
is a primary distinction (by representing it at the highest
available taxonomic level). The last of these schemes (Whit-
taker's), which divides the living world into Animalia, Plan-
tae, Fungi, Protista, and Monera, is the most widely received
view of the basic organization of life today (8, 9).
It has been apparent for some time, however, that the
five-kingdom scheme (and its predecessors) is not phyloge-
netically correct, is not a natural system. There are sound
logical grounds for presuming that the two eukaryotic micro-
bial taxa (Protista and Fungi) are artificial. It is generally
accepted that the metaphyta and metazoa evolved from
unicellular eukaryotic ancestors; the extant groups of eu-
karyotic microorganisms, therefore, comprise a series of
lineages some (or many) of which greatly antedate the
emergence of the Plantae and Animalia. This is confirmed by
the fossil record, wherein recognizable eukaryotic unicells
appear about 200 million years before the first primitive
algae, and over a billion years before the first animals and
higher plants (10). There are thus good reasons in principle to
presume that the Protista and perhaps also the Fungi are
paraphyletic at best.
More seriously, in giving the kingdom Monera the same
taxonomic rank as the Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, and Protista,
the five-kingdom formulation ignores the fact that the differ-
ences between Monera (prokaryotes) and the four other
kingdoms are far more significant, and of a qualitatively
different nature, than the differences among these four. In

other words, a primary division of life must lie between the
bacteria and the eukaryotic forms; the animal/plant distinc-
tion is definitely secondary.
This realization
is by no means new. Microbiologists
acknowledged it more than 100 years ago (11), and, ofcourse,
Chatton (12) codified it with his famous eukaryote-prokary-
ote proposal, dividing all life into these two primary catego-
ries. This view of life, strangely, has coexisted for some time
now with the five-kingdom scheme, despite their basic in-
compatibility, and despite the fact that the evidence over-
whelmingly supports the former. However, the eukaryote-
prokaryote concept itself has been seriously misunderstood
and, consequently, wrongly interpreted.
The problem here arises because the eukaryote-prokary-
ote concept is fundamentally cytological, and only second-
arily, and by inference, phylogenetic. The presumption that
the eukaryotic form of cellular organization defines a mean-
ingful phylogenetic unit is a reasonable one; organisms with
this cytology are united by possession of a series of complex
properties. The same is unfortunately not true of prokary-
otes, which are united as a class by their lack of the
characteristics that define the eukaryotic cell. The definition
is consequently a negative one that is empty of meaningful
internal phylogenetic information. Microbiologists have long
recognized this (even before the articulation of the eukary-
otic-prokaryotic concept): e.g., Cohn in 1875: "Perhaps the
designation of Schizophytae may recommend itself for this
first and simplest division of living beings . .. even though its
distinguishing characters are negative rather than positive"
(11); Pringsheim in 1923: ".
.
. the possibility of ... conver-
gent evolution [among bacteria must] be seriously consid-
ered" (13); and Stanier in 1971: "Indeed the major contem-
porary procaryotic groups could well have diverged at an
early stage in cellular evolution, and thus be almost as
isolated from one another as they are from eucaryotes as a
whole" (14).
As the molecular and cytological understanding of cells
deepened at a very rapid pace, beginning in the 1950s, it
became feasible in principle to define prokaryotes positively,
on the basis of shared molecular characteristics. However,
since molecular biologists elected to work largely in a few
model systems, which were taken to be representative, the
comparative perspective necessary to do this successfully
was lacking. By default, Escherichia coli came to be consid-
ered typical of prokaryotes, without recognition of the un-
derlying faulty assumption that prokaryotes are monophy-
letic. This presumption was then formalized in the proposal
that there be two primary kingdoms: Procaryotae and Eu-
caryotae (15, 16). It took the discovery of the archaebacteria
to reveal the enormity of this mistake.
On the cytological level archaebacteria are indeed pro-
karyotes (they show none of the defining eukaryotic charac-
teristics), but on the molecular level they resemble other
procaryotes, the eubacteria, no more (probably less) than
they do the eukaryotes (1, 17). Procaryotae (and its synonym
Monera) cannot be a phylogenetically valid taxon.
Basis for Restructuring
What must be recognized is that the basis for systematics has
changed; classical phenotypic criteria are being replaced by
molecular criteria. As Zuckerkandl and Pauling (5) made
clear many years ago, it is at the level of molecules (partic-
ularly molecular sequences) that one really becomes privy to
the workings of the evolutionary process. Molecular se-
quences can reveal evolutionary relationships in a way and to
an extent that classical phenotypic criteria, and even molec-
ular functions, cannot; and what is seen only dimly, if at all,
at higher levels of organization can be seen clearly at the level
of molecular structure and sequences. Thus, systematics in
the future will be based primarily upon the sequences,
structure, and relationships of molecules, the classical gross
properties of cells and organisms being used largely to
confirm and embellish these.
It is only on the molecular level that we see the living world
divide into three distinct primary groups. For every well-
characterized molecular system there exists a characteristic
eubacterial, archaebacterial, and eukaryotic version, which
all members of each group share. Ribosomal RNAs provide
an excellent example (in part because they have been so
thoroughly studied). One structural feature in the small
subunit rRNA by which the eubacteria can be distinguished
from archaebacteria and eukaryotes is the hairpin loop lying
between positions 500 and 545 (18), which has a side bulge
protruding from the stalk of the structure. In all eubacterial
cases (over 400 known) the side bulge comprises six nucle-
otides (ofa characteristic composition), and it protrudes from
the "upstream" strand ofthe stalk between the fifth and sixth
base pair. In both archaebacteria and eukaryotes, however,
the corresponding bulge comprises seven nucleotides (of a
different characteristic composition), and it protrudes from
the stalk between the sixth and seventh pair (18, 19). The
small subunit rRNA of eukaryotes, on the other hand, is
readily identified by the region between positions 585 and 655
(E. coli numbering), because both prokaryotic groups exhibit
a common characteristic structure here that is never seen in
eukaryotes (18, 19). Finally, archaebacterial 16S rRNAs are
readily identified by the unique structure they show in the
region between positions 180 and 197 or that between posi-
tions 405 and 498 (18, 19). Many other examples of group-
invariant rRNA characteristics exist; see refs. 2, 18, and 19.
[The reader wishing to gain a broader and more detailed
appreciation for the molecular definition of the three groups
can consult refs. 2, 20, and 21 and the proceedings of the most
recent conference on archaebacteria (22).]
Molecular characterizations also reveal that the evolution-
ary differences among eubacteria, archaebacteria, and eu-
karyotes are of a more profound nature than those that
distinguish traditional kingdoms, such as animals and plants,
from one another. This is most clearly seen in the functions
that must have evolved early in the cell's history and are basic
to its workings. All eubacteria, for example, exhibit nearly
the same subunit pattern (in terms of numbers and sizes) in
their RNA polymerases; however, this pattern bears little
relationship to that seen in either the archaebacteria or the
eukaryotes (23). On the other hand, eukaryotes are unique in
using three separate RNA polymerase functions (24).
The fossil record indicates that photosynthetic eubacteria
(and by inference, therefore, archaebacteria and possibly
eukaryotes) were already in existence 3-4 billion years ago
(25), so that the evolutionary events that transformed the
ancestor common to all life into the individual ancestors of
each of the three major groups must have occurred over a
relatively short time span early in the planet's history. Both
the relatively rapid pace of, as well as the profound changes
associated with, this early evolutionary transition argue that
this universal ancestor was a simpler, more rudimentary
entity than the individual ancestors that spawned the three
groups (and their descendants) (26).
Fig. 1 is a universal phylogenetic tree, showing the rela-
tionships among the primary groups. The root of the tree is
seen to separate the eubacteria from the other two primary
groups, making the archaebacteria and eukaryotes specific
(but distant) relatives. A relationship between archaebacteria
and eukaryotes
is not overly surprisingly,
for with few
exceptions (the rRNA being one) the archaebacterial ver-
sions of molecules resemble their eukaryotic homologs more
than their eubacterial ones (24, 29, 30). Among the ribosomal
proteins there are even cases where the archaebacterial and

FIG. 1.
Universal phylogenetic tree in rooted form, showing the three domains. Branching order and branch lengths are based upon rRNA
sequence comparisons (and have been taken from figure 4 of ref. 2). The position of the root was determined by comparing (the few known)
sequences of pairs of paralogous genes that diverged from each other before the three primary lineages emerged from their common ancestral
condition (27). [This rooting strategy (28) in effect uses the one set of (aboriginally duplicated) genes as an outgroup for the other.] The numbers
on the branch tips correspond to the following groups of organisms (2). Bacteria: 1, the Thermotogales; 2, the flavobacteria and relatives; 3,
the cyanobacteria; 4, the purple bacteria; 5, the Gram-positive bacteria; and 6, the green nonsulfur bacteria. Archae: the kingdom Crenarchaeota:
7, the genus Pyrodictium; and 8, the genus Thermoproteus; and the kingdom Euryarchaeota: 9, the Thermococcales; 10, the Methanococcales;
11, the Methanobacteriales; 12, the Methanomicrobiales; and 13, the extreme halophiles. Eucarya: 14, the animals; 15, the ciliates; 16, the green
plants; 17, the fungi; 18, the flagellates; and 19, the microsporidia.
eukaryotic homologs have no apparent counterpart among
the eubacteria (29, 30).
From a systematic perspective the specific relationship
between eukaryotes and archaebacteria does not require
taxonomic recognition; these two groups are sufficiently
dissimilar, and they diverged so early, that little would be
gained by defining a taxon that encompasses both. In other
words, the archaebacteria and eukaryotes themselves show
the kind of profound molecular differences that distinguish
either from the eubacteria.
Proposal for a New Highest Level Taxon
The only truly scientific foundation of classifi-
cation is to be found in appreciation of the
available facts from a phylogenetic point of view.
Only in this way can the natural interrelation-
ships [among organisms]
. .. be properly under-
stood. (31)
A phylogenetic system must first and foremost recognize
the primacy of the three groupings, eubacteria, and archae-
bacteria and eukaryotes. These must stand above the con-
ventionally recognized kingdoms, Animalia and the like. This
raises the question ofwhether the term "kingdom" should be
used for the taxon of highest rank, with the traditional
kingdoms being assigned to a new, lower-level taxon. For
two reasons we feel this is not the correct solution: From a
scientific perspective, the distinctions among eubacteria,
archaebacteria, and eukaryotes are more profound than those
customarily associated with kingdoms. Furthermore, two
centuries of association of the label "kingdom" with the
animals and (green) plants constitutes a tradition that would
be most difficult and divisive to change. The most flexible and
informative (and least disruptive) approach would appear to
be to add a new rank at the top of the existing hierarchy. The
name we propose for this new and highest taxon is "domain"
(whose Latin counterpart we take to be regio). The formal
suffix that we would associate with names of domains is -a,
chosen for its simplicity.
Naming of the individual domains has been guided by
several general considerations: (i) maintaining appropriate
continuity with existing names; (ii) suggesting basic charac-
teristics of the group; and (iii) avoiding any connotation that
the eubacteria and archaebacteria are related to one another,
which, unfortunately, is implied by their common names. For
the eubacteria the formal name Bacteria, based upon a
traditional common name for the group, is suggested. The
term Eucarya derives from that group's common name and
captures its defining cytological characteristic-i.e., cells
with well-defined encapsulated nuclei. The archaebacteria
are called Archaea to denote their apparent primitive nature
(vis a vis the eukaryotes in particular). The formal names for
the domains are simple enough that they can also serve in
common usage (note that this requires that "bacteria" be
used in a sense that does not include the archaea). Addition-
ally, "eukaryotes" will continue to be an acceptable common
synonym for the Eucarya. However, we recommend aban-
donment of the term "archaebacteria," since it incorrectly
suggests a specific relationship between the Archaea and the
Bacteria.
We will not at this time address the matter of the individual
kingdoms within the domains, with the exception of the
Archaea. For the others, suffice it to say that, there will be
numerous kingdoms within each domain, and their formal
structuring will require a more detailed analysis than is
possible here. We anticipate that such an analysis of the
Eucarya will preserve the kingdoms Plantae, Animalia, and
Fungi (with the last somewhat restructured to reflect new
molecular insights), and will replace Protista with a series of
kingdoms corresponding to the various ancient protistan
lineages. For the Bacteria, we expect that the majority of the
described "phyla" (2) will deserve elevation to kingdom
rank.
There are, however, two reasons for suggesting formal
names for the kingdoms that constitute the Archaea at this
time: One is that the phylogenetic structure of the domain
seems relatively simple and well defined at the kingdom level.
The other is that the kingdoms within the Archaea have never
had appropriate names of any kind.
Phylogenetically the Archaea fall into two distinct groups,
two major lineages (refs. 2 and 32; see Fig. 1). One, the
methanogens and their relatives, is phenotypically heteroge-
neous, comprising extreme halophiles, sulfate-reducing spe-
cies (the genus Archaeoglobus), and two types of thermo-
philes (the genus Thermoplasma and the Thermococcus-
Pyrococcus group), in addition to the three methanogenic
lineages (2, 33). The proposed formal name for the metha-
nogens and their relatives is Euryarchaeota. For this king-
dom we use the common name euryarchaeotes or, more
casually, euryotes.

The other archaeal kingdom comprises most of what have
been variously called the "thermoacidophiles,"
"sulfur-
dependent archaebacteria," "eocytes," or "extreme ther-
mophiles." It is a physiologically relatively homogeneous
group, whose niches are entirely thermophilic (2). Since
thermophily is the only general phenotype that occurs on
both major branches of the Archaea, it is presumably the
ancestral phenotype of the Archaea (2). For this kingdom we
suggest the name Crenarchaeota. In common usage crenar-
chaeotes or crenotes would be acceptable.
DeNinitions
Domain Eucarya [Greek adjective EV (good; true in modern
common usages); and Greek noun Kapwv (nut or kernel;
refers to the nucleus in modem biological usage)]: cells
eukaryotic; cell membrane lipids predominantly glycerol
fatty acyl diesters; ribosomes containing a eukaryotic type of
rRNA (2, 18, 19).
Domain Bacteria [Greek noun f3aK r'pov (small rod or
staff)]: cells prokaryotic; membrane lipids predominantly
diacyl glycerol diesters; ribosomes containing a (eu)bacterial
type of rRNA (2, 18, 19).
Domain Archaea [Greek adjective apxaioq (ancient, prim-
itive)]: cells prokaryotic; membrane lipids predominantly
isoprenoid glycerol diethers or diglycerol tetraethers; ribo-
somes containing an archaeal type of rRNA (2, 18, 19).
Kingdom Euryarchaeota (Archaea) [Greek adjective E'tsP
(broad, wide, spacious), for the relatively broad spectrum of
niches occupied by these organisms and their varied patterns
of metabolism; Greek adjective apXaloq (ancient, primitive)]:
ribosomes containing a euryarchaeal type of rRNA (2, 18,
19).
Kingdom Crenarchaeota (Archaea) [Greek noun K P 7
(spring, fount), for the ostensible resemblance of this phe-
notype to the ancestor (source) of the domain Archaea; and
Greek adjective 6pXaloq (ancient, primitive)]: ribosomes
containing a crenarchaeal type of rRNA (2, 18, 19).
Conclusion
The system we propose here will repair the damage that has
been the unavoidable consequence of constructing taxo-
nomic systems in ignorance of the likely course of microbial
evolution, and on the basis of flawed premises (that life is
dichotomously organized; that negative characteristics can
define meaningful taxonomies). More specifically, it will (i)
provide a system that is natural at the highest levels; (ii)
provide a system that allows a fully natural classification of
microorganisms (eukaryotic as well as prokaryotic);
(iit)
recognize that, at least in evolutionary terms, plants and
animals do not occupy a position of privileged importance;
(iv) recognize the independence of the lineages of the Ar-
chaea and the Bacteria; and (v) foster understanding of the
diversity of ancient microbial lineages (both prokaryotic and
eukaryotic).
