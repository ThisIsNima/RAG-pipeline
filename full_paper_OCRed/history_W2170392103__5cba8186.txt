Abstract
Since the completion of the genome sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in 19961,2, there has
been an exponential increase in complete genome sequences accompanied by great advances in
our understanding of genome evolution. Although little is known about the natural and life
histories of yeasts in the wild, there are an increasing number of studies looking at ecological and
geographic distributions3,4, population structure5-8, and sexual versus asexual reproduction9,10.
Less well understood at the whole genome level are the evolutionary processes acting within
populations and species leading to adaptation to different environments, phenotypic differences
and reproductive isolation. Here we present one- to four-fold or more coverage of the genome
sequences of over seventy isolates of the baker's yeast, S. cerevisiae, and its closest relative, S.
paradoxus. We examine variation in gene content, SNPs, indels, copy numbers and transposable
elements. We find that phenotypic variation broadly correlates with global genome-wide
phylogenetic relationships. Interestingly, S. paradoxus populations are well delineated along

geographic boundaries while the variation among worldwide S. cerevisiae isolates shows less
differentiation and is comparable to a single S. paradoxus population. Rather than one or two
domestication events leading to the extant baker's yeasts, the population structure of S. cerevisiae
consists of a few well-defined geographically isolated lineages and many different mosaics of
these lineages, supporting the idea that human influence provided the opportunity for cross-
breeding and production of new combinations of pre-existing variation.
The baker's yeast, S. cerevisiae, has had a long association with human activity11, leading to
the idea that use in fermentation lead to domestication. Two domestication events have been
suggested, one for sake strains and one for wine12. In contrast, its closest relative, S.
paradoxus, has never been associated with human activity and is found globally, sometimes
in the same locations as S. cerevisiae3,4. A preliminary comparison within the
Saccharomyces sensu stricto group exhibited extensive variation between S. paradoxus
populations on different continents but limited variation among S. cerevisiae isolates and no
correlation with geographic location8.
Here we report nearly complete genome sequences of S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus from a
large variety of sources and locations (Table S1 and S2). The S. cerevisiae strains included
the reference S288c plus other lab, pathogenic, baking, wine, food spoilage, natural
fermentation, sake, probiotic and plant isolates. The S. paradoxus isolates were mostly from
oak tree bark from the three recognised populations6,8,13 as well as Siberia, Hawaii and the
previously designated S. cariocanus14. There is overlap in the general geographic sources of
isolates from both species. The majority of strains were sequenced using Sanger sequencing
on ABI3730s. For some strains sequence was obtained using the Illumina Genetic Analyser
(IGA). Most strains were covered to a depth of 1-4X with a few covered more extensively
(Table S3). The sequence reads, assemblies, alignments, a BLAST tool and a genome
browser are all publicly available15.
We identified 235127 high-quality SNPs and 14051 indels in the S. cerevisiae nuclear
genome, and 623287 SNPs and 25267 indels in S. paradoxus. Our S288c sequence differs
from the reference genome by 498 high-quality unambiguous SNPs (Fig. S1). For 480 SNPs
our S288c sequence is supported by other strains whereas the reference has no support,
while for 18 SNPs the reference sequence is supported by other strains while ours is not.
Many of the former are likely to represent errors in the reference sequence (Table S4). The
reference sequence for the type strain of S. paradoxus16 was not complete and so we
sequenced the type strain CBS432 to 4.3X coverage with ABI and 80X with IGA.
Sequence surveys allow novel sequences not found in the reference genome to be identified.
The proportions of unplaced reads for each strain are shown in Table S2. We found 38 new
hypothetical ORFs in these sequences that are likely to be real. These ORFs are present in
more than one strain (Fig. S2), with some specific to a single lineage, such as the SGRP
hypothetical protein 5 (see SI) in the West African lineage, which contains a conserved
methyltransferase domain. Much of the unplaced material is subtelomeric. This is in contrast
to a genome-wide analysis of copy number based on the numbers of reads of each strain
aligning to each gene in the reference sequence, which showed very little significant copy
number variation (CNV) outside the rDNA region (see SI).
Neighbour-joining (NJ) phylogenetic trees based on pairwise SNP differences in the
alignments were generated (Fig. 1 and S3). The S. paradoxus strains fall into the three
previously described populations, plus one isolate from Hawaii. Most of the SNPs in S.
paradoxus are private polymorphisms within each population, resulting in a clear separation
of the three populations17 (Fig. 2A). The European population was sampled extensively,
which provided a picture of within-population structure (Fig. 1B).

The S. cerevisiae population structure is more complex. There are five lineages that exhibit
the same phylogenetic relationship across their entire genomes, which we consider to be
‘clean’ non-mosaic lineages (Fig. 1C). These are strains from Malaysia, West Africa, sake
and related fermentations (Sake), North America, and a large cluster of mixed sources
containing many European and wine strains (Wine/European). The remaining strains are on
long branches between the Wine/European cluster and the other four clean lineages. While
some lineages correspond to geographic origin, such as those from North America and
Malaysia, many closely related strains are from widely separated locations. This mixed
architecture could be due to human traffic in yeast strains and subsequent recombination
between them. Analysis with STRUCTURE is consistent with separate populations for the
West African, Malaysian, Sake and Wine/European lineages (Fig. 2B). The North American
isolates share some polymorphisms with all four separate populations while the rest of the
strains share polymorphisms with the European lineage and at least one other population.
Analysis of SNP distributions (Table S5) is consistent with the NJ tree phylogeny (Fig. 1C)
and the STRUCTURE analysis (Fig 2B). Each clean lineage is monomorphic for the
majority of segregating sites while the mosaics are polymorphic for the majority of sites.
Phylogenetic trees constructed for individual chromosomes or smaller segments (Fig. S4)
demonstrate the mosaic nature of these genomes, as do segmental comparisons (Fig. S5).
For example, the laboratory strains SK1 and Y55 appear to be the result of recent crosses
between the West African lineage and the European lineage (Fig. S5B). Similarly, W303 is a
recent cross between the reference S288c lineage and one or more other lineages. Different
segments of the mosaics fall into different locations in the NJ tree (Fig. S4). The recently
sequenced clinical derivative YJM78918 is another example. This complex population
structure of S. cerevisiae is seen in a similar study reported in this issue19 and is consistent
with five well-delineated lineages, two of which contain isolates used in fermentation
industries12, plus a number of recombinant strains, many of which are also used for
fermentation. Phenotypic profiling (see below), and analyses of rDNA repeat unit variation
(Fig. S6) and Ty element abundance (Fig. S7 and Table S6) produce results consistent with
this overall picture of the S. cerevisiae population structure.
Has the entire sequence space of S. cerevisiae been sampled? It is clear that segments from
many of the mosaic strains are not related to any of the five clean lineages and are probably
derived from yet to be determined or no longer existing lineages. A quarter (24%) of SNPs
are found only in the mosaics (Table S5), which provides a measure of the unsampled S.
cerevisiae species space.
Sequence variability was quantified using the average pairwise divergence within a
population (θπ) and the proportion of polymorphic sites (θS)10. We estimated these
parameters for various populations (Table S7). Both θπ and θS are about 0.001 in the UK
population of S. paradoxus. The Wine/European cluster of S. cerevisiae has approximately
the same level of diversity. In both the global and Wine/European samples of S. cerevisiae
Tajima's D20 is significantly negative, indicating an excess of singleton polymorphisms,
which may be a consequence of our sampling strategy. By contrast, the UK sample of S.
paradoxus from a single population has a positive Tajima's D, though not significantly,
indicating a relative abundance of mid-frequency polymorphisms. Linkage disequilibrium
differs between samples (Fig. 3A). For S. paradoxus linkage disequilibrium declines
smoothly with distance, decaying to half its maximum value at about 9kb, as previously
reported10. For both S. cerevisiae samples the linkage disequilibrium decays much faster,
with a half maximum at 3kb or less. This implies more recombination in S. cerevisiae,
perhaps due to more opportunities for strains to mate and recombine.

Patterns of variation can reveal evidence of natural selection. As expected for weakly
deleterious mutations, the derived allele frequencies (DAF, SI) for nonsynonymous
polymorphism are lower than synonymous polymorphism (Fig. 3B). For polymorphisms
with DAF<20%, there were 0.86 amino acid changing polymorphisms for each silent one. In
contrast, for those with DAF>20% this ratio was 0.34, indicating that at least 61%
(1-0.34/0.86) of the 24418 amino acid changing polymorphisms with DAF<20% are
deleterious. Similar calculations (SI) indicate that 27% of non-coding polymorphisms with
DAF <20% are deleterious (Fig. S8A). We also performed McDonald-Kreitman tests21 on
1105 genes for which we had enough statistical power. No evidence for positive selection
after a multiple testing correction was found (Fig. S8B). These analyses assume that
synonymous polymorphisms are neutral. However, we found an excess of polymorphism at
both low and high frequency (Fig. 3B) in genes with high codon bias (CAI >0.6). Further
analysis (SI) indicates that codon bias in S. cerevisiae is maintained by both purifying and
positive selection, as suggested by the mutation-selection-drift model22.
A previous genome-wide study in Arabidopsis23 reported a large number of seemingly
highly deleterious alleles. We found 134 mutations that were predicted to introduce stop
codons (Fig. 3B), including 5 in genes previously reported to be essential in S288c (SI).
These mutations showed a skewed frequency distribution and were enriched in the C-termini
(the final 5% of proteins, Fig. 3B inset).
This dataset allowed the consideration of insertions and deletions (Fig. 3C). We identified
3870 indels in the coding regions of the S. cerevisiae population. Of these 731 had minor
allele frequency (MAF) greater than 10%. We also found 657 indels (72 with MAF >10%)
in genes identified as essential (SI). Indels with MAF >10% predicted to cause frame-shifts
were enriched in the C-terminal 5% of the protein (Fig. 3C, inset). The proportion of frame-
shift to in-frame indels decreases strongly as a function of MAF (Fig. 3D). For example, at
MAF >15% there are 1.0 out-of-frame indels for every in-frame indel, compared to 15.5 at
MAF <10%. We estimate that 93% (1-1.0/15.5) of the 2949 out-of-frame indels with MAF
<10% are deleterious.
All strains were subjected to high throughput phenotypic analysis under multiple conditions
(Fig. 4 and Fig. S9). Growth curves were sampled (>250 time points) over three days and
the relevant growth variables: lag (adaptation), rate (slope) and efficiency (maximum
density) were extracted24, providing roughly 200 phenotypic traits. The phenotypic
variation allowed clustering of strains. There is a high qualitative overlap between the
phenotypic clustering and the phylogenies based on SNPs (Fig. 4 and Fig. 1). Also the
correlation between genotypic and phenotypic similarity within S. cerevisiae is surprisingly
good (Spearman rank test, correlation coefficient = 0.30, p=10−26) given that conventional
phenotypic taxonomy generally fails even to resolve the Saccharomyces sensu stricto
species. No individual environment determined the overall correlation between genotype
and phenotype.
The S. paradoxus strains were well separated from the S. cerevisiae strains (Fig. 4), except
for the Hawaiian isolate. The phenotypes most clearly (p<10−9) separating the two species
were strong S. paradoxus resistance to cycloheximide and sensitivity to paramomycin, heat
and copper (Fig. S10A). The S. cerevisiae isolates fell into two groups (Fig. 4). One contains
most of the Wine/European, Sake lineages and most of the long-branch recombinants, while
the other mainly consists of the North American, Malaysian and African lineages. The main
phenotypic characteristic separating these groups is rapid growth (short lag and steep slope
in rate, p<10−4) for the Wine/European and mosaics, which could be advantageous for the
fermentation processes many of these strains are used for (Fig. S10B). Despite genomic
variation, S. paradoxus strains (excluding the Hawaiian isolate) show 38% lower phenotypic

variation than S. cerevisiae strains (p=0.002). In S. cerevisiae, the phenotypic variance is as
high among the clean lineages as among the mosaic lineages (p=0.78). Hence, the higher
phenotypic variance in S. cerevisiae is not driven by outbreeding or domestication per se,
but rather suggests that S. cerevisiae occupies a wider diversity of ecological niches than S.
paradoxus.
This survey of S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus population genomics reveals extensive
differences in genomic and phenotypic variation despite ecological similarities and will
allow rapid fine mapping of the genetic determinants. Is there evidence of domestication in
S. cerevisiae as previously debated12? One could interpret our results in two ways. One is a
domestication of one or two groups, the Wine/European and Sake strains, with selection for
improved fermentation properties. These domesticated groups then gave rise to feral and
clinical derivatives as well as being involved in the generation of outcrossed derivatives
found in all sources. Alternatively, human activity simply may have utilised existing strains
from populations that had appropriate fermentation properties providing the opportunity to
outbreed through movement of strains as well as providing a novel disturbed environment.
Using domestication to imply “species bred in captivity”25 the strains that best fulfil this
definition are the baking isolates as they have clearly arisen from crosses between lineages.
Lineages that were selected from captively bred strains would be expected to have lower
diversity than other lineages. This is not the case for the Wine/European or Sake lineages,
which have similar or greater levels of diversity compared to the other clean lineages or to S.
paradoxus populations. This view of human activity simply moving yeast strains around
without captive breeding is consistent with analysis of over 600 strains26. Recent findings in
the Malaysian rainforest (from which our three Malaysian S. cerevisiae strains were
isolated) of chronic intake of alcoholic nectar from bertram palm by wild treeshrews suggest
that the association of fermented beverages and primates is ancient and not exclusive to
humans27.
Beyond the analyses we have presented here, the sequence data we have obtained for these
strains have many other applications, and have already been used both for global28 and gene
specific29 studies. With the advent of new sequencing technology it is becoming possible to
undertake similar population genomic studies for species with much larger genomes,
including human30, enabling a new era of genome wide evolutionary and functional
genetics.
Methods Summary
Strains to be sequenced were selected in order to maximise the variety of sources and
locations of isolation. Except for laboratory strains, a single meiotic diploid spore was
isolated from the original strain to remove any heterozygosity8. DNA was extracted from
overnight cultures8 for subsequent sequencing on ABI3730s and an Illumina Genetic
Analyser15. Reference-based genome assemblies were created for each strain in a series of
steps15. Each read was aligned to the reference genome (S288c or CBS432). As this
approach cannot deal with large indels or with sequences not present in the reference
genome, we developed an iterative parallel alignment assembling tool, PALAS (see
Supplementary Methods), to introduce insertions that were allowed to share material
between related strains. Two versions of each strain sequence were produced, a partial
assembly derived just from data collected from that strain, and a more complete assembly
using an imputation process to infer the most likely sequence of the strain taking into
account data from related strains. In both cases confidence estimates are given for each base
call. The SNPs obtained were used to generate Neighbour-joining phylogenetic trees15,
infer population structure17, estimate sequence divergence10, analyse polymorphisms10.
Non-aligned reads (those missing in the reference genome) were searched for potential

novel genes. Each strain isolate was subjected to precise phenotyping in 67 experimental
conditions using a high-resolution micro-cultivation Bioscreen C (Growth curve Oy,
Finland)24. Two consecutive rounds of 48-hour pre-cultivation in SC media were followed
by a 72-hour cultivation in stress media. Readings of optical density were taken every 20
minutes. Strains were tested as duplicates (N=2). Growth variables were normalized to the
behaviour of the 20 BY4741 replicates.

Fig. 3. Population genomics: variation and selection
a, Linkage disequilibrium as a function of distance averaged over 1kb. Insets show the
decline in linkage disequilibrium over the first 10kb. Details shown in Table S7.
b, Derived allele frequencies of SNPs in coding regions. Amino acid changing SNPs (‘a’)
show an excess of low frequencies compared to synonymous SNPs (‘s’). Synonymous SNPs
in genes with strong codon bias (‘s*’) are in excess at low and high frequencies. SNPs that
create stop codons (‘create stop’) show skew to low frequencies. Inset is the number of
mutations occurring over the length of the protein, exceeding three standard deviations from
the mean in the C-terminus.
c, Distribution of sizes of indel polymorphisms in coding regions. High frequency indels
(>10%, red) more often occur in multiples of 3 than low frequency indels (grey). Inset is as
for b.
d, Frequency distribution of indels in coding regions. Out of frame indels (grey) show
excess at low frequencies relative to in frame indels (unfilled). The proportion of out of
frame indels decreases as frequency increases. Error bars represent the standard error of the
proportion.

Fig. 4. Saccharomyces phenotype variation
A selection of growth phenotypes for S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus strains in different
environments and drugs. The complete set of lag, rate and density phenotypes in 67
environments is displayed in Fig. S9. Phenotypes were quantified using high-resolution
micro-cultivation measurements of population density. Strain (n=2) doubling time (rate)
phenotypes in relation to the S288c derivative BY4741 (n=20) are displayed. Green = poor
growth, red = good growth. Hierarchical clustering of phenotypes was performed using a
centered Pearson correlation metric and average linkage mapping. Blue = S. paradoxus, pink
= S. cerevisiae, grey = S. bayanus isolate CBS7001.
