Two hundred and seven species of ﬁsh, mostly Australian marine ﬁsh, were sequenced (barcoded) for
a 655 bp region of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene (cox1). Most species were
represented by multiple specimens, and 754 sequences were generated. The GC content of the 143
species of teleosts was higher than the 61 species of sharks and rays (47.1% versus 42.2%), largely
due to a higher GC content of codon position 3 in the former (41.1% versus 29.9%). Rays had higher
GC than sharks (44.7% versus 41.0%), again largely due to higher GC in the 3rd codon position in
the former (36.3% versus 26.8%). Average within-species, genus, family, order and class Kimura two
parameter (K2P) distances were 0.39%, 9.93%, 15.46%, 22.18% and 23.27%, respectively. All
species could be differentiated by their cox1 sequence, although single individuals of each of two
species had haplotypes characteristic of a congener. Although DNA barcoding aims to develop
species identiﬁcation systems, some phylogenetic signal was apparent in the data. In the neighbour-
joining tree for all 754 sequences, four major clusters were apparent: chimaerids, rays, sharks and
teleosts. Species within genera invariably clustered, and generally so did genera within families. Three
taxonomic groups—dogﬁshes of the genus Squalus, ﬂatheads of the family Platycephalidae, and tunas
of the genus Thunnus—were examined more closely. The clades revealed after bootstrapping
generally corresponded well with expectations. Individuals from operational taxonomic units
designated as Squalus species B through F formed individual clades, supporting morphological
evidence for each of these being separate species. We conclude that cox1 sequencing, or ‘barcoding’,
can be used to identify ﬁsh species.

1. INTRODUCTION
It has long been recognized that DNA sequence
diversity,
whether
assessed
directly or
indirectly
through protein analysis, can be used to discriminate
species.
More
than
40
years
ago,
starch
gel
electrophoresis of proteins was ﬁrst used to identify
species (Manwell & Baker 1963). Nearly 30 years
ago, single gene sequence analysis of ribosomal DNA
was being used to investigate evolutionary relation-
ships at a high level (Woese & Fox 1977), and
mitochondrial DNA approaches dominated molecu-
lar systematics in the late 1970s and 1980s (Avise
1994).
Recently, Tautz et al. (2002, 2003) made the case for
a DNA-based taxonomic system. DNA sequence
analysis has been used for 30 years to assist species
identiﬁcations, but different sequences have been used
for different taxonomic groups and in different
laboratories. Hebert et al. (2003) proposed that a single
gene sequence would be sufﬁcient to differentiate all, or
at least the vast majority of, animal species, and
proposed the use of the mitochondrial DNA gene
cytochrome oxidase subunit I (cox1) as a global
bioidentiﬁcation system for animals. The sequence
was likened to a barcode, with species being delineated
by a particular sequence or by a tight cluster of very
similar sequences.
Empirical support for the barcoding concept ranges
from studies of invertebrates (e.g. springtails and
butterﬂies) to birds (Hebert et al. 2004a,b; Hogg &
Hebert 2004). However, the approach is not without
controversy (e.g. Lipscomb et al. 2003; Moritz &
Cicero 2004). For a barcoding approach to species
identiﬁcation
to
succeed,
within-species
DNA
sequences need to be more similar to one another
than to sequences in different species. Recent studies
show that this is generally the case, but there are
exceptions. Hybridization among species would create
taxonomic uncertainty: mitochondrial DNA is mater-
nally inherited and any hybrid or subsequent gener-
ation would have the maternal species DNA only.
Here we examine whether barcoding can be used to
discriminate ﬁsh species. There are probably close to
30 000 ﬁsh species worldwide (the FishBase count of
species on March 31 2005 was 28 800—see www.
ﬁshbase.org), constituting about 50% of all vertebrate
species. They are systematically very diverse, ranging
from ancient jawless species (Agnatha: hagﬁsh and
lampreys) through to cartilaginous ﬁshes (Chon-
drichthyes: chimaeras, sharks and rays) and to old
and modern bony ﬁsh (Osteichthyes: coelacanths, eels,
carps, tunas, ﬂatﬁshes, salmonids, seahorses, etc.). In
2000, ﬁsheries provided more than 15% of total animal
protein to the global food supply, employed about

35 million people, and had an estimated ﬁrst sale value
of about US$81 billion (FAO 2002): ﬁsh and ﬁsh
products are important contributors to human food
security.
Accurate and unambiguous identiﬁcation of ﬁsh and
ﬁsh products, from eggs to adults, is important in many
areas. It would enable retail substitutions of species to be
detected, assist in managing ﬁsheries for long-term
sustainability, and improve ecosystem research and
conservation. Hitherto, a wide variety of protein- and
DNA-based methods have been used for the genetic
identiﬁcation of ﬁsh species (see, for example, Ward &
Grewe 1994; Pe´rez-Martin & Sotelo 2003). Here we
examine cox1 diversity within and among 207 ﬁsh
species, most of which have been examined from
multiple specimens, with the goal of determining
whether DNA barcoding can achieve unambiguous
species recognition in ﬁsh. Most of the species examined
were Australian commercial species, but many more
such species and bycatch species remain to be barcoded.
2. MATERIAL AND METHODS
Tissue subsamples were isolated from fragments of white
muscle of (mostly) Australian ﬁsh species that had been
stored at K80 8C for several years. The majority of these
samples had been initially collected for the protein ﬁnger-
printing of Australia’s commercial domestic and imported
ﬁsh species (Yearsley et al. 1999, 2003), others were from
species of special interest to scientists at the Commonwealth
Scientiﬁc and Industrial Research Organization’s division of
Marine and Atmospheric Research. Some of the samples
were from voucher specimens. Generally we aimed, where
possible, to sample ﬁve individuals per species (four species
were sampled at greater intensity) and achieved this target for
47.5% of the 207 species sequenced. Numbers per species
ranged from one to 15 with a mean of 3.66.
DNA extracts were prepared from muscle tissue using
Chelex dry release (Hajibabaei et al. 2005). Approximately
655 bp were ampliﬁed from the 50 region of the cox1 gene
from mitochondrial DNA using different combinations of
four newly designed primers:
FishF1-50TCAACCAACCACAAAGACATTGGCAC30,
FishF2-50TCGACTAATCATAAAGATATCGGCAC30,
FishR1-50TAGACTTCTGGGTGGCCAAAGAATCA30,
FishR2-50ACTTCAGGGTGACCGAAGAATCAGAA30.
In one case, the broadnose shark (Notorhynchus cepedianus),
an
internal
forward
primer
(50ATCTTTGGTGCAT-
GAGCAGGAATAGT30) was used in conjunction with
FishR2 to yield a shorter fragment (616 bp). The 25 ml PCR
reaction mixes included 18.75 ml of ultrapure water, 2.25 ml of
10! PCR buffer, 1.25 ml of MgCl2 (50 mM), 0.25 ml of each
primer (0.01 mM), 0.125 ml of each dNTP (0.05 mM),
0.625 U of Taq polymerase, and 0.5–2.0 ml of DNA template.
Ampliﬁcations were performed using a Mastercyclerw
Eppendorf gradient thermal cycler (Brinkmann Instruments,
Inc.). The thermal regime consisted of an initial step of 2 min
at 95 8C followed by 35 cycles of 0.5 min at 94 8C, 0.5 min at
54 8C, and 1 min at 72 8C, followed in turn by 10 min at 72 8C
and then held at 4 8C. PCR products were visualized on 1.2%
agarose gels and the most intense products were selected for
sequencing. Products were labelled using the BigDyew
Terminator v.3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems,
Inc.) and sequenced bidirectionally using an ABI 3730
capillary sequencer following manufacturer’s instructions.
Sequence data, electropherograms, and primer details for
specimens are available within the completed project ﬁle
‘Fishes of Australia Part 1’ on the Barcode of Life database site
at the University of Guelph (see http://www.barcodinglife.
org). GenBank numbersare DQ107581to DQ108334and are
matched against individual specimens in the ‘Fishes of
Australia Part 1’ ﬁle.
Sequences were aligned using SEQSCAPE v.2.5 software
(Applied Biosystems, Inc.). Sequence divergences were
calculated using the Kimura two parameter (K2P) distance
model (Kimura 1980). Neighbour-joining (NJ) trees of K2P
distances were created to provide a graphic representation of
the patterning of divergence between species (Saitou & Nei
1987). In the three chosen subgroups of ﬁsh, bootstrapping
was performed in MEGA3 (Kumar et al. 2004) with 1000
replications.
Nearly all the target species ampliﬁed using one or both
primer sets. However, there was insufﬁcient product for
sequencing from ﬁve species: N. cepedianus (nZ5), Asymbolus
rubiginosus (orange spotted catshark, nZ2), Neoplatycephalus
conatus (deepwater ﬂathead, nZ5), Cephalopholis igarashiensis
(goldbar grouper, nZ1) and Epinephelus undulatostriatus
(Maori rockcod, nZ2). The Maori rockcod samples were in
a degraded condition, probably explaining their PCR
recalcitrance. For N. cepedianus, a newly designed internal
forward primer was used as described above to obtain
product that could be sequenced.
3. RESULTS
We present results for all 207 species followed by more
detailed examinations of three subgroups of ﬁsh. These
subgroups were ﬂatheads (14 species from three
genera), large tunas (genus Thunnus, eight species),
and dogﬁsh or spurdogs of the genus Squalus (which
contains several Australian morphs that have not been
formally described as species). Flatheads and tunas are
teleosts; spurdogs are chondrichthyans.
(a) All species
A total of 207 species were analysed, giving (because of
multiple specimens for most species) a total of 754
sequences. The full K2P/NJ tree has been lodged as an
Electronic Appendix. It is presented here in summary
form as ﬁgure 3. All 207 species can be differentiated by
coxI barcoding. We did not choose species known to be
readily differentiable; indeed, we included several sets
of sibling species (for example, in the genera Squalus
and Thunnus) and many species were congeneric.
Read lengths were all about 655 bp long, although in
some instances some base calls were uncertain. No
insertions, deletions or stop codons were observed in
any sequence. The lack of stop codons is consistent
with all ampliﬁed sequences being functional mito-
chondrial cox1 sequences, and that, together with the
fact that all ampliﬁed sequences were about 655 bp in
length, suggests that NUMTs (nuclear DNA sequences
originating from mitochondrial DNA sequences) were
not sequenced (vertebrate NUMTS are typically
smaller than 600 bp; Zhang & Hewitt 1996).
The average K2P distance of individuals within
species was 0.39% compared with 9.93% for species
within genera (table 1). Overall, therefore, there was ca
25! more variation among congeneric species than
among conspeciﬁc individuals. Mean divergence

among species within families increases to 15.5%, and
among species within orders and classes it increases to
22.2% and 23.3%, respectively (table 1, ﬁgure 1). The
rate of increase declines in the higher taxonomic
categories due to substitutional saturation.
There was a higher overall GC content in the 143
species of bony ﬁsh compared with the 61 species of
sharks and rays (47.1G0.2% versus 42.2G0.3%, see
also table 2). This difference was attributable (table 3,
ﬁgure 2) to the GC content of the 1st (57.1% versus
53.5%) and, especially, 3rd codon base (41.1% versus
29.9%). The variance of GC content among species of
each of the three groups of ﬁshes (chimaerids, sharks
and rays, teleosts) was much higher for the 3rd base
(GC3) than the 1st base (table 3, ﬁgure 2); the 2nd base
was nearly invariant. The mean GC content of the 20
barcoded ray species was higher than the 41 shark
species (44.7G0.4% versus 41.0G0.3%). This was
again mostly attributable to GC3 (36.3G1.3% versus
26.8G0.9%). Ten of the 13 species with GC3 O35%
were rays, while all seven with GC3 !21% were sharks.
This disparity helps to explain the multimodal distri-
bution in GC3 content in sharks and rays (ﬁgure 2).
Originally we had thought that we had two species
that were identical with respect to their cox1 barcodes,
Centrophorus moluccensis (Endeavour dogﬁsh) and
Centrophorus uyato (southern dogﬁsh). However, on
receipt of the barcode data we re-checked the
identiﬁcation history of these samples and discovered
that the two specimens originally classiﬁed as C. uyato
had in fact independently been re-identiﬁed by a shark
taxonomist as C. moluccensis. This experience attests to
the absolute necessity of correct species identiﬁcation
in the development of any barcode library. Further,
while such a library is being developed, specimens
should be retained until fully analysed to facilitate the
reappraisal of any potentially spurious results. Voucher
collection is a necessity.
Two species of Hydrolagus, Hydrolagus lemures
(blackﬁn ghostshark) and Hydrolagus ogilbyi (Ogilbys
ghostshark), were originally regarded as speciﬁcally
distinct (Last & Stevens 1994) but have been
provisionally amalgamated in a world revision of the
group (D. Didier, personal communication). In our
study, the ﬁve samples of H. lemures clustered tightly
together (mean genetic distance of 0.21%), as did the
four samples of H. ogilbyi (mean genetic distance of
0.19%), with a mean distance between the two taxa of
6.80%. Barcoding (and earlier protein ﬁngerprinting;
Yearsley et al. 1999) supports the contention that these
are distinct species.
In several instances, we detected deep divergences
among individuals that had been assigned to single
species. These deep divergences may ﬂag previously

unrecognized species and warrant further study. Two
such examples (see ﬁgure 3) will be brieﬂy described.
Two individuals of Hydrolagus novaezelandiae (short-
nose chimaera), both collected off the east coast of the
South Island of New Zealand, showed a divergence of
14.08%. One of these individuals was only tentatively
ascribed to this species. It is likely, in retrospect, that
this identiﬁcation was incorrect or that an undescribed
species exists. These two specimens also had distinct
protein ﬁngerprints (Yearsley et al. 2003). Clearly the
incorrectly designated specimen is neither H. lemures
nor H. ogilbyi, as both these species are distinct from
both specimens of H. novaezelandiae.
Deep divergence was also seen between one speci-
men of the monotypic genus Pastinachus (cowtail
stingrays) and two further specimens (within- and
between-group divergences of 0.61% and 6.43%
respectively). Recent studies have shown that Parupe-
neus sephen is a complex of morphologically distinct
species in the Indo-Paciﬁc (Last et al. 2005), and the
high cox1 divergence probably reﬂects the presence of
two of these species.
Possible examples of shared haplotypes were seen in
the genera Pristiophorus and Plectropomus. Five samples
of each of two species of Pristiophorus were sequenced
(Pristiophorus cirratus, the common sawshark, and
Pristiophorus nudipinnis, the southern sawshark), but
one of the P. nudipinnis samples had an identical cox1
sequence to two of the P. cirratus samples. Excluding
this aberrant sample, the mean genetic distance within
species was 0.35% and the mean genetic distance
between species was 10.94%. Similarly, one of two
specimens of Plectropomus leopardus (common coral
trout) clustered very closely with ﬁve specimens of
Plectropomus maculatus (barcheek coral trout; mean
sequence divergence of the six samplesZ0.19%) and
away from the remaining Pl. leopardus sequence
(divergenceZ4.64%). In both genera, the aberrant

samples might reﬂect shared haplotypes (perhaps from
past introgressive hybridization between species—in
both instances the species have overlapping ranges) or,
possibly, misidentiﬁcation of the original specimens.
(b) Flatheads, family Platycephalidae
Flatheads are scorpaeniform ﬁsh and members of the
family Platycephalidae, of which there are some 60
species worldwide in 18 genera (see http://www.
ﬁshbase.org; also see Nelson 1994). We examined
15 mostly commercially signiﬁcant species from three
genera, but one species, Neoplatycephalus conatus,
failed to amplify. Most of the species were rep-
resented by multiple specimens (ﬁgure 4). Two
genera
(Platycephalus
and
Neoplatycephalus)
are
members of the subfamily Platycephalinae; the
third, Cymbacephalus, belongs to the subfamily
Onigociinae (Matsubara & Ochiai 1955). Keenan
(1988) suggested the subfamily Cymbacephalinae be
revived for a small group of species including one
examined here, Cymbacephalus nematophthalmus.
All assemblages of conspeciﬁc individuals had
bootstrap values of 95–100%. K2P nucleotide diversity
within species was extremely limited, ranging from 0%
to 0.93%, with a mean of 0.22%. Ten individuals of
Platycephalus longispinis were examined, ﬁve each from
eastern and western Australia: there was no obvious
east–west separation of these individuals in the
P. longispinis clade.
Divergence between species was high, with average
within-genus and within-family K2P distances of
15.55% and 22.07%, respectively. Two distinct clades
representing the subfamilies Onigociinae (Cymbace-
phalus, two species) and Platycephalinae (Platycephalus
and Neoplatycephalus, ten and two species respectively)
were recognized with a bootstrap value of 99%. Four
subclades with bootstrap support values of 90–100%
can be seen within the Platycephalinae clade: (i)
P. longispinis/P. bassensis; (ii) P. caeruleopunctatus/
P. speculator; (iii) P. fuscus/P. endrachtensis/P. indicus;
(iv) N. aurimaculatus/N. richardsoni.
(c) Tunas of the genus Thunnus
Tunas are large highly migratory ﬁsh of the family
Scombridae. All are commercially important, some
extremely so (FAO 2004). There are eight species in
the genus Thunnus (we follow Collette et al. (2001) in
separating T. thynnus thynnus and T. thynnus orientalis
into two species, T. thynnus and T. orientalis, respect-
ively), six of which are found in Australian waters:
T. obesus (bigeye tuna), T. alalunga (albacore),
T. albacares (yellowﬁn tuna), T. maccoyii (southern
blueﬁn tuna), T. orientalis (northern blueﬁn tuna) and
T. tonggol (longtail tuna). We sequenced ﬁve individuals
of each of these species. We also sequenced four
individuals of T. atlanticus (Atlantic blackﬁn tuna) and
four individuals of T. thynnus (Atlantic blueﬁn tuna);
for the latter, we downloaded data for a further three
individuals from GenBank. Finally, we downloaded
two additional sequences from GenBank for T. alalunga
and added three additional sequences that we collected
for T. albacares from South African waters.
The resulting phenogram (ﬁgure 5) of 46 sequences
appears very different from the ﬂathead phenogram.
Each species clustered as a separate assemblage (no
individuals were misplaced), but bootstrap values for
species separation were mostly around the 60–70%
level. Genetic differences were very small within species,
with a mean K2P distance of 0.11%. The three South
African individuals of T. albacares could not be separated
from the ﬁve Australian individuals. The mean inter-
species distance was very low at 1.04%. Only one clade
had a high level of bootstrap support (99%), comprising
T. orientalis and T. alalunga.

(d) Dogﬁshes of the genus Squalus
The genus Squalus is represented in Australian waters
by three nominal species (Squalus acanthias, Squalus
megalops and Squalus mitsukurii) and six species that
have not been formally named (Squalus spp. A–F).
These nine species are described in Last & Stevens
(1994). We sequenced ﬁve S. acanthias (white-spotted
dogﬁsh), four S. megalops (spikey dogﬁsh), ten S.
mitsukurii (green-eye dogﬁsh), four S. sp. B (eastern
highﬁn spurdog), nine S. sp. C (western highﬁn
spurdog), two S. sp. D (fatspine spurdog), two S. sp.
E (western longnose spurdog) and ﬁve S. sp. F (eastern
longnose spurdog), but did not have access to samples
of S. sp. A.
The resulting phenogram of 41 sequences (ﬁgure 6)
shows that there are three major clades: S. acanthias,
S. megalops, and a S. mitsukurii/S. spp. B–F group.
These separate out with bootstrap values of 94–100%.
Species B, C, D, E and F form distinct subclades within
the S. mitsukurii/S. spp. B–F clade, with bootstrap
values of 92–100%. Four of the S. sp. C specimens
were originally identiﬁed as S. mitsukurii, but
were found to be S. sp. C following independent
re-identiﬁcation by a shark taxonomist; barcoding
supported their identiﬁcation as S. sp. C. All S. sp. C
specimens have been collected from SW Australia. The
single apparent S. mitsukurii in clade F was assigned to
S. mitsukurii based on morphology; but it now appears
likely that this specimen was in fact S. sp. F. This
specimen, along with those of S. sp. F, came from the
New South Wales coast off eastern Australia. There
appear to be two remaining clades of S. mitsukurii: the
cluster of ﬁve specimens with a bootstrap value of 99%
were all from the Great Australian Bight, the cluster of
four specimens with a bootstrap value of 78%
comprised three from New South Wales and one
from
Western
Australia.

Omitting the one apparently misclassiﬁed specimen,
genetic differences were again small within species, with
a mean K2P distance of 0.33%. The mean interspecies
distance within the genus was quite low at 4.17%.
4. DISCUSSION
This study has strongly validated the efﬁcacy of cox1
barcodes for identifying ﬁsh species. We sequenced
(usually multiple) specimens of three species of
chimaerids, 61 species of sharks and rays and 143
species of teleosts for the barcode region of cox1. With
no exceptions, all 207 sequenced species could be
discriminated. Nearly 98% of all species ampliﬁed with
the one of two primer sets. Only ﬁve of 211 species
failed to amplify with these protocols, and one of these
ampliﬁed with a newly-designed primer set. The four
failures came from varied ﬁsh groups and included
congeners of species that ampliﬁed without problem;
they may reﬂect either DNA degradation or primer
mismatches. Since our two commonly-used primer sets
are extremely similar, we are exploring the possibility of
a single, quasi-universal ﬁsh primer set that incorpor-
ates inosine at the variable positions or has built-in
degeneracy.
The GC content of the 655 bp mitochondrial cox1
region was on average higher in the 143 species of
Osteichthyes than in the 61 species of Chondrichthyes:
47.1% versus 42.2%. Saccone et al. (1999) reviewed

errors of the GC percentages of the 3rd, 1st and 2nd
bases of the Osteichthyes were 0.50, 0.10 and 0.02,
respectively (see also ﬁgure 2). This reﬂects the fact
that most synonymous mutations occur at the 3rd
position, with a few at the 1st position and none at the
2nd. The higher GC content of the Osteichthyes
compared with Chondrichthyes was largely due to
3rd base variation, with mean values of 41.1% and
29.9%, respectively, although 1st base differentiation
was also observed. Within the Chondrichthyes, GC
content of rays was higher than that of sharks (44.7%
versus 41.0%), again largely due to GC3 variation. The
causes for the GC variation among teleosts, sharks and
rays are not known.
No NUMTs (transfers of mtDNA cox1 sequences
into the nuclear genome) were observed. A review of
the occurrence of NUMTs in plants and animals did
not ﬁnd any evidence of their existence in Actinopter-
ygii (Bensasson et al. 2001), but a comparison of Fugu
rupripes mtDNA and nuclear DNA sequences did
detect seven or eight NUMTs (Richly & Leister 2004).
This conﬁrms the need for vigilance in examining ﬁsh
amplicons for potential pseudogene status.
Confusion in taxonomic assignments as a result of
inter-speciﬁc hybridization (Verspoor & Hammar
1991) does not seem to be a major issue—only two of
754 sequences (one in the genus Pristiophorus and one
in Plectropomus) appeared in the ‘wrong’ congeneric
species. This may represent either introgressive hybrid-
ization, or incorrect identiﬁcation of the original
specimen.
Although barcode analysis seeks only to delineate
species boundaries, there is clearly some phylogenetic
signal in cox1 sequence data. For example, four major
clusters were apparent in the NJ phenogram: chimaer-
ids, rays, sharks and dogﬁsh and teleosts. Congeneric
species always clustered together and in most cases so
did confamilial species. However, methodologies for
phylogeny reconstruction from molecular data remain
somewhat controversial, with a wide variety of dis-
parate approaches possible (see, for example, Nei &
Kumar 2000). We cannot hope to recover the true
phylogeny of ﬁshes from a 655 bp fragment of
mitochondrial DNA through K2P distance and
neighbour joining—rather more gene regions should
be used (including nuclear genes) and additional
analytic methods deployed including maximum parsi-
mony and maximum likelihood.
Cox1 barcoding for species identiﬁcation is far more
powerful than, for example, protein ﬁngerprinting.
Reliable discrimination of Thunnus species using
conventional protein electrophoresis is hard if not
impossible (e.g. Yearsley et al. 1999), but we found that
the same samples were readily identiﬁed by cox1
sequencing.
Barcoding discriminated all of the ﬁsh species we
examined, and would clearly be capable of unambigu-
ously identifying individually isolated ﬁsh eggs, larvae,
ﬁllets and ﬁns from these species. However, some taxa
showed deeper divergence than others. For example,
the average within-genus divergence of the ﬂatheads
(Platycephalus, Neoplatycephalus, Cymbacephalus) was
15.55%, considerably larger than the 4.17% of the
genus Squalus, which is itself considerably larger than
the within-Thunnus divergence of 1.11%. These
differences among genera probably reﬂect the average
age of species divergence, although within genera some
species will be older than others. Nevertheless, it seems
likely that, for example, the Platycephalus radiation
preceded the Thunnus radiation. The large tunas have
long been suspected of having diverged relatively
recently (see, e.g. Elliott & Ward 1995 for allozyme
evidence of limited nuclear DNA differentiation).
The Thunnus phenogram (ﬁgure 5) only clearly
differentiates one clade (T. alalunga and T. orientalis,
with 99% bootstrap support). The mitochondrial DNA
similarity of T. alalunga and T. orientalis had been earlier
described by Chow & Kishino (1995), from cyto-
chrome b and ATPase sequencing. The three species
suggested by Collette (1978) to comprise a separate
subgenus Neothunnus (Thunnus atlanticus, T. tonggol
and T. albacares) form a loosely deﬁned clade in the cox1
phenogram (56% bootstrap support). Our cox1 pheno-
gram is almost identical to one based on sequencing
400 bp of the mtDNA control region of the same eight
species (Alvarado Bremer et al. 1997). One minor
difference is that the control region tree gives a higher
level of bootstrap support, 86%, to the proposed
subgenus Neothunnus. The three Neothunnus species
differ from the other ﬁve species (proposed subgenus
Thunnus) in having central heat exchangers rather than
lateral heat exchangers, and in being conﬁned to more
tropical waters (Collette 1978).
Many of the ﬂathead species that were barcoded
(ﬁgure 4) were earlier examined allozymically by
Keenan (1991). His proposed cladogram of the
Platycephalinae component is very similar to the
Platycephalinae component of ﬁgure 3—the four
subclades identiﬁed from cox1 were also present in
the allozyme tree. The mitochondrial and nuclear
(allozyme) trees thus compare well. The genera
Neoplatycephalus and Cymbacephalus appear to be
monophyletic, Platycephalus being paraphyletic.
There do not appear to have been any prior surveys
of genetic differentiation among species of the genus
Squalus, although S. acanthias has been used as a model
elasmobranch in some DNA sequencing studies
(e.g. Stock & Powers 1995; Hong et al. 1996; Salaneck
et al. 2003). Squalus was picked as a genus of particular
interest as it included several provisional species (Last
& Stevens 1994). The cox1 data clearly supported the
biological reality of the species, Squalus spp. B, C, D, E
and F, as each of these species had bootstrap values
close to 100% for their constituent individuals
(ﬁgure 6). Indeed, there was greater genetic divergence
among these species than among the well-recognized
Thunnus species.
The various unresolved questions about specimen
identiﬁcation brieﬂy presented here (for the genera
Squalus, Centrophorus, Hydrolagus, Pristiophorus) indi-
cate the need to retain whole voucher specimens
wherever possible, or at least make an e-voucher from
a photograph. While we retained a single voucher
specimen for the majority of species discussed here,
most other samples are only represented as small tissue
samples. Retaining all specimens as vouchers will
require signiﬁcant infrastructure facilities as many ﬁsh
are large: this may not be practical but it might be
Barcoding Australian ﬁsh

feasible to retain whole specimens of most species at
least until barcoding of those specimens is complete.
In our survey, conspeciﬁc samples often (but not
always, see the P. longispinis example) came from
adjacent areas. Thus we might have somewhat under-
estimated the extent of within-species diversity. How-
ever, any such effect is likely to be minor. Allozyme
surveys of marine ﬁsh indicate that typically only about
5% percent of genetic variance comes from inter-
population differentiation. This percentage is appreci-
ably higher for freshwater ﬁsh, around 20% on average
(Ward et al. 1994). For freshwater ﬁsh, sampling should
include individuals from different watersheds whenever
possible.
Our results reveal that cox1 barcoding will permit the
unambiguous identiﬁcation of the vast majority of ﬁsh
species. We now intend to extend our survey to all
Australian and all North American ﬁsh species. In the
longer term, it is hoped that broader collaborations will
enable the assembly of a global database of ﬁsh cox1
sequences. This will mean collecting sequences from at
least 25 000 species. Note that this will inevitably mean
that for many species, multiple specimens from widely
divergent locations will be sequenced, minimizing the
concern expressed above about underestimating gen-
etic diversity. With increasing application of DNA
barcoding, many previously unrecognized ﬁsh species
will be revealed through the discovery of deep
divergence of cox1 sequences within currently recog-
nized species. There might also be instances of
supposedly distinct species that have identical cox1
sequences, suggesting the possibility of species fusion.
Resolution of cases of this nature will require careful
morphological analysis from expert taxonomists before
any ﬁnal recommendations can be made. Barcoding
and morphological analysis should go hand-in-hand.
Once a global cox1 barcode database has been
established for ﬁshes, anyone with direct or indirect
access to a DNA sequencer will be able to identify, to a
high degree of certainty, any ﬁsh egg, larva or carcass
fragment. This will be an invaluable tool for ﬁsheries
managers, ﬁsheries ecologists and ﬁsh retailers, and
for those wishing to develop ﬁsh identiﬁcation micro-
arrays. The scientiﬁc and practical beneﬁts of ﬁsh
barcoding are manifold.
