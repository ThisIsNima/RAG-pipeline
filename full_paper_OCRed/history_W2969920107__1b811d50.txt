Although considerable progress has been made in recent years regarding the
classiﬁcation of bacteria assigned to the phylum Bacteroidetes, there remains a
need to further clarify taxonomic relationships within a diverse assemblage that
includes organisms of clinical, piscicultural, and ecological importance. Bacteroidetes
classiﬁcation has proved to be difﬁcult, not least when taxonomic decisions rested
heavily on interpretation of poorly resolved 16S rRNA gene trees and a limited number
of phenotypic features. Here, draft genome sequences of a greatly enlarged collection
of genomes of more than 1,000 Bacteroidetes and outgroup type strains were used
to infer phylogenetic trees from genome-scale data using the principles drawn from
phylogenetic systematics. The majority of taxa were found to be monophyletic but several
orders, families and genera, including taxa proposed long ago such as Bacteroides,
Cytophaga, and Flavobacterium but also quite recent taxa, as well as a few species
were shown to be in need of revision. According proposals are made for the recognition
of new orders, families and genera, as well as the transfer of a variety of species to other
genera. In addition, emended descriptions are given for many species mainly involving
information on DNA G+C content and (approximate) genome size, both of which can
be considered valuable taxonomic markers. We detected many incongruities when
comparing the results of the present study with existing classiﬁcations, which appear to
be caused by insufﬁciently resolved 16S rRNA gene trees or incomplete taxon sampling.
The few signiﬁcant incongruities found between 16S rRNA gene and whole genome trees
underline the pitfalls inherent in phylogenies based upon single gene sequences and the
impediment in using ordinary bootstrapping in phylogenomic studies, particularly when
combined with too narrow gene selections. While a signiﬁcant degree of phylogenetic
conservation was detected in all phenotypic characters investigated, the overall ﬁt to the
tree varied considerably, which is one of the probable causes of misclassiﬁcations in the
past, much like the use of plesiomorphic character states as diagnostic features.

Genome-Based Taxonomic Classiﬁcation of Bacteroidetes
INTRODUCTION
The Bacteroidetes constitute a cosmopolitan phylum that inhabits
a broad array of habitats on Earth. One of the key members
of the microbiota of animals belongs to this phylum, as they
occur especially in the gastrointestinal tract and the oral cavity as
commensal microorganisms (Moore et al., 1994; Thomas et al.,
2011). Bacteroidetes colonize a variety of other natural habitats
such as soils, sediments, sea water and freshwater (Thomas et al.,
2011), and some even tolerate extreme environmental conditions
(Anders et al., 2014). This is reﬂected in the great metabolic
diversity of the phylum, which includes aerobes (Bernardet,
2011a; Nakagawa, 2011a; Hahnke R. L. et al., 2016) as well as
anaerobes (Thomas et al., 2011), even though Bacteroidetes are
generally chemoorganoheterotrophs. Some strains are known
as pathogens, particularly of ﬁsh (Bernardet and Grimont,
1989; Bernardet et al., 1996). Many Bacteroidetes produce
pigments, particularly carotenoids (Goodwin, 1980; Sowmya
and Sachindra, 2016) and ﬂexirubin-like pigments (Reichenbach
et al., 1974, 1980); in some cases proteorhodopsin has been
observed (González et al., 2008; Yoshizawa et al., 2012). The cell
shape ranges from short rods to long ﬁlaments (Saputra et al.,
2015; Hahnke R. L. et al., 2016); longer cells are often ﬂexible,
including curved or helical shapes (Eder et al., 2015; Shakeela
et al., 2015a). Spherical degenerative forms called “spheroblasts”
are known from Flavobacterium (Bernardet and Bowman, 2006).
Many Bacteroidetes are motile and, if so, display motility by
a special form of gliding (McBride and Zhu, 2013; Nan et al.,
2014; McBride and Nakane, 2015; Nan, 2017). Their isoprenoid
quinones are menaquinones, usually unsaturated ones, with
varying chain lengths (Collins and Jones, 1981). Striking
features of Bacteroidetes are their specialized carbohydrate
decomposition machineries, oligosaccharide uptake systems, and
storage features that enables them to play a key role in the
decomposition of particulate organic matter (Martens et al.,
2009; Sonnenburg et al., 2010; Dodd et al., 2011; Fischbach and
Sonnenburg, 2011; Thomas et al., 2011; Reintjes et al., 2017;
Mathieu et al., 2018).
The phylum Bacteroidetes is subdivided into the classes
Bacteroidia,
Chitinophagia,
Cytophagia,
Flavobacteriia,
Saprospiria, and Sphingobacteriia, some of which emerged
only in the most recent taxonomic studies on the group
(Hahnke R. L. et al., 2016; Munoz et al., 2016). The taxonomic
history of the phylum is indeed somehow convoluted. The
name Bacteroidaeota was recently suggested for the phylum
in the course of a proposal to include the rank phylum in the
International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (Oren
et al., 2015; Whitman et al., 2018). Yet the name Bacteroidetes
is not much older (Krieg et al., 2010a) since beforehand these
organisms had been referred to as “Cytophaga-Flavobacteria-
Bacteroides group” (Woese, 1987; Paster et al., 1994). The early
classiﬁcation of the bacteria now placed in Bacteroidetes was
mainly based on morphological, metabolic, and physiological
properties. Genera such as Flavobacterium (class Flavobacteriia),
Cytophaga, and Flexibacter were diﬀerentiated by presence or
absence of gliding motility (Bernardet et al., 1996); Cytophaga
and Flexibacter, which are now assigned to the class Cytophagia,
were also delineated based on cell morphology, G+C content
and habitat (Reichenbach, 1989). Anaerobic representatives of
the class Bacteroidia, which form an important part of the ﬂora
of the gastrointestinal tract of animals (Thomas et al., 2011),
can be diﬀerentiated from aerobic groups such as the classes
Flavobacteriia and Cytophagia (Bernardet, 2011a; Nakagawa,
2011a; Hahnke R. L. et al., 2016) and only relatively recently were
recognized as belonging to the same phylum, as based on 16S
rRNA gene sequencing (Weisburg et al., 1985; Paster et al., 1994).
Anaerobic and aerobic Bacteroidetes are still targeted by distinct
subcommittees of the International Committee on Systematics
of Prokaryotes (Bernardet et al., 2002; Olsen and Shah, 2008).
Whereas, some Bacteroidetes are halotolerant (Lau et al., 2006a)
or thermotolerant (Albuquerque et al., 2011), those originally
described as halophilic or thermophilic Bacteroidetes are now
placed in other phyla (Hahnke R. L. et al., 2016; Munoz et al.,
2016). Known from phylogenetic analyses as close relatives of
the phylum Chlorobi, Bacteroidetes were recently suggested to
belong to the “Bacteroidaeota-Rhodothermaeota-Balneolaeota-
Chlorobaeota superphylum” (Hahnke R. L. et al., 2016), following
a proposal to use the ending -aeota for the names of phyla in
microbial taxonomy (Oren et al., 2015). If adhering to the
simpliﬁcation of the suﬃx to -ota (Whitman et al., 2018),
this superphylum would need to be called “Bacteroidota-
Rhodothermota-Balneolota-Chlorobiota superphylum.”
As in other groups of Bacteria and Archaea, advances
in molecular systematics led to the view that taxonomic
classiﬁcation should be based on the integrated use of genotypic
and phenotypic data (Wayne et al., 1987; Stackebrandt, 1992),
an approach known as polyphasic taxonomy (Colwell, 1970;
Vandamme et al., 1996; Gillis et al., 2005; Kämpfer and Glaeser,
2012). In particular, 16S rRNA gene sequences have been
routinely applied to infer phylogenetic trees or in conjunction
with simpler approaches such as pairwise distance or similarities
(Meier-Kolthoﬀet al., 2013b; Kim and Chun, 2014; Yarza
and Munoz, 2014). However, trees based on a few thousand
nucleotides such as those based on a single phylogenetic marker
(1,400–1,500 nucleotides in the case of the 16S rRNA gene),
or even a few concatenated housekeeping genes throughout the
technique named Multi-Locus Sequence Analysis (Glaeser and
Kämpfer, 2015), tend to have branches with low bootstrap values
(Klenk and Göker, 2010). A signiﬁcant proportion of the current
taxonomic classiﬁcation may thus be lacking statistical evidence
(Klenk and Göker, 2010; Hahnke R. L. et al., 2016; Montero-
Calasanz et al., 2017; Nouioui et al., 2018). Moreover, while
integrating phenotypic information is part of the polyphasic
approach, the phenotype is rarely used in a manner that
could provide independent evidence because it is not normally
separately analyzed but only screened for “diagnostic” features
of (often unsupported) groups seen in 16S rRNA gene trees
(Montero-Calasanz et al., 2017). The principles of phylogenetic
systematics instead insist on monophyletic taxa, which implies
that they must be based on apomorphic (derived) character
states and not merely on “diagnostic” ones (Hennig, 1965; Wiley
and Lieberman, 2011; Montero-Calasanz et al., 2017; Nouioui
et al., 2018). Thus, the question arises which taxa proposed by
polyphasic taxonomy are actually monophyletic.

Genome-Based Taxonomic Classiﬁcation of Bacteroidetes
Indeed, given the rapid and ongoing progress in sequencing
technologies (Mavromatis et al., 2012), classiﬁcations based on
whole genome sequences and associated bioinformatic tools can
exploit millions of characters and thereby provide a step change
in reliability, as evidenced by high average bootstrap support in
phylogenomic trees (Breider et al., 2014; Meier-Kolthoﬀet al.,
2014a). Yet the ordinary bootstrap is not necessarily the most
reliable approach when dealing with supermatrices potentially
comprised of genes with distinct evolutionary histories (Siddall,
2010; Simon et al., 2017). The taxonomic classiﬁcation of
Bacteroidetes has recently been revised based on the 16S and
23S rRNA genes in conjunction with 29 orthologous protein
sequences (Munoz et al., 2016), which resulted in the proposal of
several new taxa within Bacteroidetes as well as the new phylum
Rhodothermaeota. A number of additional Bacteroidales families
have been proposed in a recent phylogenomic study (Ormerod
et al., 2016), whereas genome sequences from phase I of the One
Thousand Microbial Genomes (KMG) project (Mukherjee et al.,
2017) were used in an initial study covering the entire phylum
(Hahnke R. L. et al., 2016). Again, reclassiﬁcations resulted at
all levels of the taxonomic hierarchy. Additionally, it was shown
that DNA G+C composition values directly calculated from
genome sequences have a signiﬁcantly better ﬁt to the phylogeny
than the experimentally determined ones cited in many species
descriptions (Hahnke R. L. et al., 2016). This is in line with the
observation that within-species variation is at most 1% when
G+C content is calculated from genome sequences (Meier-
Kolthoﬀet al., 2014c) and that previous reports in the literature
that the variation in G+C content within bacterial species is at
most 3 mol% (Mesbah et al., 1989) or even 5% (Rosselló-Mora
and Amann, 2001) can be attributed to experimental error in
traditional methods (Mesbah et al., 1989; Moreira et al., 2011).
Despite the recent progress, coverage of Bacteroidetes type
strains with genome sequences was far from complete in
the cited studies, and many taxonomic questions remained
unanswered. This is problematic particularly since taxonomic
classiﬁcation is not an end in itself but aﬀects all other
biological disciplines, in particular ecology, including the
ecology of Bacteroidetes (Hahnke R. L. et al., 2016). Moreover,
in contrast to the G+C content (Hahnke R. L. et al., 2016)
genome size has been minimally investigated as taxonomic
marker. In a recent study on the phylum Actinobacteria
genome sized appeared to work reasonably well as marker
albeit less well than the G+C content (Nouioui et al.,
2018). Likewise, it has not yet systematically been explored
how
well
the
phenotypic
markers
traditionally
used
in
Bacteroidetes taxonomy actually ﬁt to trees inferred from
genome-scale data. In fact, phylogenetic conservation needs
not even be measurable in features traditionally used in
microbial taxonomy, but the same holds for genomic features,
including individual alignment positions in individual genes
(Carro et al., 2018).
Expanding our previous study on Bacteroidetes (Hahnke
R. L. et al., 2016) and in analogy to our study on the phylum
Actinobacteria (Nouioui et al., 2018), we here use genome
sequences from phase II of the KMG project augmented with
publicly available ones generated by third parties, yielding
a phylogenomic dataset covering more than 1,000 type-
strains of Bacteroidetes and outgroup taxa. A comprehensive
collection of type-strain 16S rRNA gene sequences from
the literature was used to further complement these data.
Genome-scale phylogenetic trees were constructed to address
the following questions: (i) to what extent are phylogenies
calculated from whole genome sequences still in conﬂict with
the current classiﬁcation of Bacteroidetes and with their 16S
(or 23S) rRNA gene phylogenies? (ii) Which taxa need to
be revised because they are evidently non-monophyletic?
(iii) What are historical causes for the establishment of
these non-monophyletic taxa? (iv) Which taxon descriptions
should be modiﬁed because of inaccurate or missing G+C
values?
and
(v)
How
do
standard
phenotypic
markers,
G+C values and genome sizes of Bacteroidetes relate to
their phylogeny and to which degree can they serve as a
taxonomic markers?
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A total number of 1,040 Bacteroidetes and outgroup type-strain
genome sequences and annotations (Supplementary Table 1)
were taken from an earlier study (Hahnke R. L. et al., 2016)
and augmented with additional ones collected from GenBank but
mainly with genome sequences obtained de novo in the course of
the KMG project phase II (Mukherjee et al., 2017) and annotated
and deposited in the Integrated Microbial Genomes platform
(Chen et al., 2019) and in the Type-Strain Genome Server
database (Meier-Kolthoﬀand Göker, 2019). All newly generated
KMG sequences underwent standard quality control at DSMZ for
DNA extraction and at JGI for genome sequencing documented
on the respective web pages and yielded <100 contigs. All
genome sequences had <500 contigs and matched the 16S rRNA
gene reference database described below. Structural annotation
at JGI and DSMZ was done using Prodigal v. 2.6.2 (Hyatt
et al., 2010). These annotated genome sequences were processed
further as in our previous study using the high-throughput
version of the Genome BLAST Distance Phylogeny (GBDP)
approach in conjunction with BLAST+ v2.2.30 in blastp mode
(Auch et al., 2006; Camacho et al., 2009; Meier-Kolthoﬀet al.,
2014a) and FastME v 2.1.6.1 using the improved neighbor-
joining algorithm BioNJ for obtaining starting trees followed
by branch swapping under the balanced minimum evolution
criterion (Desper and Gascuel, 2004) using the subtree-pruning-
and-regrafting algorithm (Desper and Gascuel, 2006; Lefort
et al., 2015). One hundred pseudo-bootstrap replicates (Meier-
Kolthoﬀet al., 2013a, 2014a) were used to obtain branch-
support values for these genome-scale phylogenies. Trees were
visualized using Interactive Tree Of Life (Letunic and Bork, 2011)
in conjunction with the script deposited at https://github.com/
mgoeker/table2itol. The choice of outgroup taxa was based on
previous results (Hahnke R. L. et al., 2016) but now yielded a
broader sampling of species. Species and subspecies boundaries
were explored using digital DNA:DNA hybridization (dDDH)
as implemented in the Genome-To-Genome Distance Calculator
(GGDC) version 2.1 (Meier-Kolthoﬀet al., 2013a) and in the

Genome-Based Taxonomic Classiﬁcation of Bacteroidetes
Type (Strain) Genome Server (Meier-Kolthoﬀand Göker, 2019).
The features of all genome sequences that entered these analyses
are provided in Supplementary Table 1.
A comprehensive set of aligned, near full-length 16S rRNA
gene sequences was generated by augmenting the previous
collection (Hahnke R. L. et al., 2016) with sequences from
more recent species descriptions. The taxonomic aﬃliation of
genomes was checked using RNAmmer version 1.2 (Lagesen
et al., 2007) to extract 16S rRNA gene sequences, which where
compared with the 16S rRNA gene reference database using
BLAST and phylogenetic trees. Non-matching genome sequences
were discarded from further analyses. A comprehensive sequence
alignment was generated using MAFFT version 7.271 with the
“localpair” option (Katoh et al., 2005), using either the sequences
extracted from the genome sequences or the previously published
16S rRNA gene sequences, depending on the length and number
of ambiguous bases. Trees were inferred from the alignment with
RAxML (Stamatakis, 2014) version 8.2.12 under the maximum-
likelihood (ML) criterion and with TNT (Goloboﬀet al., 2008)
version Dec. 2017 under the maximum-parsimony (MP). In
addition to unconstrained, comprehensive 16S rRNA gene trees
(UCT), constrained comprehensive trees (CCT) were inferred
with ML and MP using the bipartitions of the GBDP tree with
≥95% support as backbone constraint, as previously described
(Hahnke R. L. et al., 2016). The purpose of the constraint, which
enforces the monophyly of the well-supported groups from the
GBDP, is to inject information from the phylogenomic analysis
into the 16S rRNA gene analyses, which cover more organisms
but fewer characters. Finally, unconstrained 16S rRNA gene
trees reduced to genome-sequenced strains (URT) were inferred,
as well as unconstrained 23S (i.e., large subunit) rRNA gene
trees (ULT).
The previously collected hierarchical taxonomic classiﬁcation
of ingroup and outgroup taxa (Hahnke R. L. et al., 2016)
was augmented by screening the taxonomic literature. As in
the previous study, taxa were analyzed to determine whether
they were monophyletic, paraphyletic or polyphyletic (Farris,
1974; Wood, 1994). Taxa non-monophyletic according to the
GBDP tree were tested for evidence for their monophyly in the
UCT, ULT, URT, and the 16S rRNA gene trees, if any, in the
original publication.
In the case of a signiﬁcant conﬂict (i.e., high support values
for contradicting bipartitions, with ≥95% support considered as
high) between trees or low support in the GBDP tree, additional
phylogenomic analyses of selected taxa were conducted. To this
end, MCL (Markov Chain Clustering) version 14–137 (Enright
et al., 2002) under default settings and an e-value ﬁlter of
10−5 was used to the reciprocal best hits from GBDP/BLAST
in analogy to OrthoMCL (Li et al., 2003). The resulting
sets of orthologous proteins were aligned with MAFFT and
concatenated to form a supermatrix after discarding the few
clusters that still contained more than a single protein for at least
one genome. Comprehensive supermatrices were compiled from
all the orthologs that occurred in at least four genomes, whereas
core-genome supermatices were constructed for the orthologs
that occurred in all of the genomes. Supermatrices were analyzed
with TNT, and with RAxML under the “PROTCATLGF” model,
in conjunction with 100 partition bootstrap replicates, i.e., by
sampling (with replacement) not the single alignment positions
but entire orthologs (Siddall, 2010; Simon et al., 2017; Nouioui
et al., 2018). Shimodaira-Hasegawa (SH) paired-site tests as
implemented in RAxML were conducted with accordingly
reduced 16S rRNA gene alignments in such cases using the
supermatrix ML trees as constraint to assess whether these tests
also indicated a signiﬁcant (α = 0.01) conﬂict between 16S
rRNA gene and genome-scale data. When it was of interest,
supermatrices where also subjected to ordinary bootstrapping
as implemented in RAxML, as were single genes selected from
these supermatrices.
G+C content values and genome sizes are trivial to calculate
(Hahnke R. L. et al., 2016; Nouioui et al., 2018). Additionally,
selected
phenotypic
features
relevant
for
the
taxonomic
classiﬁcation of Bacteroidetes were as comprehensively as
possible collected from the taxonomic literature: average cell
length, average cell width, motility by gliding, absence or
presence of carotenoids, absence or presence of ﬂexirubin-like
pigments, average number of isoprene residues of the major
menaquinones (MK), and relationship to oxygen. To this
end, a recently published collection of phenotypic data from
taxonomic publications (Barberán et al., 2017) was corrected and
augmented. To avoid circular reasoning, missing features of a
species were only inferred from features of its genus when species
and genus were described in the same publication or when the
species description had explicitly been declared as adding to
the features of the genus. The reported relationships to oxygen
were checked against the cultivation conditions used for KMG at
DSMZ and where necessary augmented. Oxygen conditions were
coded as ordered multi-state character: (1) strictly anaerobic,
(2) facultatively aerobic, (3) facultatively anaerobic, (4) strictly
aerobic; microaerophilic was treated like missing data. Among
all coding options tested, this yielded the highest ﬁt to the
tree (Supplementary Table 1); the second best option was to
code microaerophilic and strictly aerobic as the same character
state. MK percentages would be more informative than just
statements about being “major” but mostly only the latter are
provided in the literature. Phylogenetic conservation of selected
phenotypic and genomic characters with respect to the GBDP
tree (reduced to represent each set of equivalent strains by only
a single genome) was evaluated using a tip-permutation test in
conjunction with the calculation of maximum-parsimony scores
with TNT as previously described (Simon et al., 2017; Carro
et al., 2018) and 10,000 permutations. While more sophisticated
tests of phylogenetic conservation are available particularly for
continuous characters, this approach eases the comparison of
discrete and continuous characters as TNT deals with both.
TNT input ﬁles were generated with opm (Vaas et al., 2013).
The proportion of times the score of a permuted tree was at
least as low as the score of the original tree yielded the p-value.
Maximum-parsimony retention indices (Farris, 1989; Wiley
and Lieberman, 2011) were calculated to further diﬀerentiate
between the ﬁt of each character to the tree.
Unambiguously non-monophyletic taxa according to the
genome-scale analyses were screened for published phenotypic
evidence of their monophyly. Published evidence was judged as

Genome-Based Taxonomic Classiﬁcation of Bacteroidetes
inconclusive when based on probably homoplastic characters
or on probable plesiomorphic character states. Importantly,
“diagnostic” features alone are insuﬃcient in phylogenetic
systematics,
as
plesiomorphies
might
well
be
diagnostic
but just for paraphyletic groups (Hennig, 1965; Wiley and
Lieberman, 2011; Montero-Calasanz et al., 2017; Nouioui
et al., 2018). Finally, taxonomic consequences were proposed
to ﬁx all obviously non-monophyletic taxa by new taxon
delineations suﬃciently supported by the CCT, i.e., not
hindered by the uncertain phylogenetic placement of taxa
whose genome sequences were not available at the time
of writing.
RESULTS
The presentation of the results of this study is organized as
follows. After a brief overview on the ﬁgures and tables the
outcome of the tests for the phylogenetic conservation are
illustrated. Next, the phylogenetic results for the outgroup taxa
and certain phylogenetically deviating Bacteroidetes are described
and put in the context of their current taxonomic classiﬁcation.
Finally, the hierarchical classiﬁcation of the phylum Bacteroidetes
itself, arranged according to the six classes in which it is
currently subdivided, is compared to the phylogenomic trees.
These sections motivate the need for a variety of reclassiﬁcations,
whereas the actual taxonomic consequences are listed at the end
of the Discussion chapter.
The GBDP tree is shown in Figures 1–8; Figure 1 provides
an overview whereas Figures 2–8 display speciﬁc sections of the
same tree in greater details. Phenotypic information for groups
of taxa whose taxonomic classiﬁcation is treated in detail below
is summarized in Supplementary Table 1. This supplementary
table also includes the complete list of genome sequences used in
this study as well as additional dDDH values for pairs of strains of
interest. Additional phylogenetic trees, including the GBDP tree
in a single ﬁgure and with phenotypic annotation, are found in
Supplementary Data Sheet 1.
Most of the Bacteroidetes and outgroup taxa appeared
to be monophyletic in the GBDP tree, mainly with high
bootstrap support. For instance, with the exception of few
deviating Bacteroides species that did not even appear to
phylogenetically belong to the phylum, all six classes were
shown as monophyletic with strong support. However, other
taxa seemed to be in need of a taxonomic revision because
they appeared as paraphyletic or polyphyletic. For instance, most
genera appeared as monophyletic, usually with high support. In
some cases, however, genera were shown as non-monophyletic,
as exempliﬁed by Algibacter (Nedashkovskaya et al., 2004b,
2007c; Park et al., 2013d; Shakeela et al., 2015b) Flaviramulus
(Einen and Øvreås, 2006; Zhang Y. et al., 2013), Maribacter
(Nedashkovskaya et al., 2004a, 2010a; Barbeyron et al., 2008;
Lo et al., 2013; Weerawongwiwat et al., 2013; Hu et al., 2015;
Jackson et al., 2015), and Tamlana (Lee, 2007; Jeong et al.,
2013b). In most of these cases, 16S rRNA gene sequence
analyses (Supplementary Data Sheet 1) already revealed the
same taxonomic problems albeit often with lower support for
certain clades. All discrepancies are described below assorted by
phylum or class. Where non-monophyletic taxa depicted in a
ﬁgure, “core” marks the clade that contains the respective type.
While

found to be higher than 70%, the current accepted threshold to
diﬀerentiate among species (Wayne et al., 1987). In turn, some of
these were lower than 79%, the threshold deﬁned to diﬀerentiate
among subspecies (Meier-Kolthoﬀet al., 2014b). All of the pairs
of genome sequences of deposits considered to represent the
same type strain were found to have dDDH similarities of 99.0%
or above with the exception of Bacteroides faecis (Kim M.-S. et al.,
2010), B. ovatus (Eggerth and Gagnon, 1932; Hahnke R. L. et al.,
2016), B. stercoris (Johnson et al., 1986), B. uniformis (Eggerth
and Gagnon, 1932; Hahnke R. L. et al., 2016), Filimonas lacunae
(Shiratori et al., 2009; Leandro et al., 2013), Flavobacterium
akiainvivens (Kuo et al., 2013), F. chilense (Kämpfer et al.,
2012b), F. johnsoniae, Polaribacter dokdonensis (Yoon et al.,
2006), Prevotella scopos and Thermophagus xiamenensis (Gao
et al., 2013), whose dDDH values ranged between 89.6 and 98.9%
dDDH, results which may account for the separation of each pair
of these strains.
Phylogenetic Conservation of Genomic
and Phenotypic Markers of Interest
Table 1 shows the p-values obtained by the tip-permutation test
and the retention values of selected genomic and phenotypic
features.
All investigated characters showed a signiﬁcant
phylogenetic conservation (α = 0.001) but the ﬁt of each
character to the tree as indicated by the retention index
varied considerably. The relatively high correspondence between
G+C content and phylogeny comes as no surprise (Hahnke
R. L. et al., 2016), while the occurrence of phylogenetic
conservation of genome size can easily be spotted in the
GBDP tree (Figures 1–8, Supplementary Data Sheet 1). For
instance, genera with uniformly rather small genomes include
Capnocytophaga (2.7 ± 0.2 Mbp), Porphyromonas (2.2 ± 0.2
Mbp), and Prevotella (3.0 ± 0.3 Mbp) whereas Dyadobacter (7.1
± 1.3 Mbp), Niastella (9.1 ± 0.7 Mbp), and Spirosoma (7.3 ±
1.0 Mbp) are genera with uniformly relatively large genomes.
Within Flavobacterium genome size apparently increased within
a certain subclade. In contrast, within the clade corresponding
to core Bacteroides, i.e., the clade containing the type species,
genome size (4.9 ± 1.1 Mbp) appeared to change rapidly in
evolutionary terms relative to the moderate average size.
Morphology showed a signiﬁcant but low conservation. In
the case of cell length a certain degree of inertia was visible
in the tendency to ﬁlamentous cells in related groups such
as Eisenibacter and Microscilla or the genus Marivirga while
elongated cells also occurred in taxa dispersed through the
phylogeny such as Chitinophaga ﬁliformis and Chryseobacterium
solincola (Supplementary Data Sheet 1). Cell width showed a
slightly higher retention index (Table 1); there was an obvious
tendency for broader cells in groups such as Bacteroides

Rhodothermaeota-Balneolaeota-Chlorobi clade. These clades are weakly supported and annotated for display purposes only; they are not suggested as reliable
groupings. Figures 2–8 show speciﬁc sections of the same tree in greater detail; while the underlying topology is exactly the same, the ordering of the clades may
slightly differ.
but there are also many isolated occurrences of cells with
a width above average (Supplementary Data Sheet 1). The
almost as well-sampled character “gliding motility” showed a
retention index comparable to the one of cell width. While
absent in almost all outgroup taxa, motility by gliding has
a rather scattered occurrence in the phylum Bacteroidetes
(Supplementary Data Sheet 1). Relationship to oxygen showed
a considerably higher retention index, which probably mainly
reﬂected the concentration of strictly anaerobic strains in
certain outgroup taxa such as the phylum Chlorobi and certain
subgroups of the class Bacteroidia; additionally, Bacteroidia did
not contain any strict aerobes (Supplementary Data Sheet 1).
As for chemotaxonomy, presence or absence of carotenoids
showed a higher retention index but while many Bacteroidetes
were described as pigmented, it was only rarely explicitly reported
whether or not the contained pigments were carotenoids
(Supplementary Data Sheet 1), which renders it diﬃcult to
attribute the apparent conservation to presence or absence in
speciﬁc groups. Presence or absence of ﬂexirubins was more
frequently reported and obtained a somewhat higher retention
index, which may in part be attributable to the complete lack of
ﬂexirubins in the outgroup taxa (Supplementary Data Sheet 1).
The average number of isoprene residues of the major
menaquinones was even more frequently reported and achieved
the highest retention index of all characters investigated.
The distribution of the character states over the phylogeny
indicated
that
this
outcome
reﬂected
the
occurrence
of
longer isoprenoid chains in some outgroup phyla but also in
speciﬁc subgroups of the class Bacteroidia, including Alistipes,
Bacteroides, Parabacteroides, and Prevotella, as well as usually
shorter isoprenoid chains in the class Flavobacteriia (Table 2,
Supplementary Data Sheet 1). The GBDP tree (Figures 1–8)
indicated that neither Flavobacteriia nor Bacteroidia separated
ﬁrst from the other classes of Bacteroidetes, which was conﬁrmed
by
supermatrix
analyses
(Supplementary Data Sheet 1).
Accordingly,
the
plesiomorphic
state
is
most
likely
the
occurrence of seven isoprene residues in the major menaquinone,
whereas a reduction to six is an apomorphy of Flavobacteriia
and an increase to ten and more is an apomorphy of certain
subgroups of Bacteroidia (Table 2).
Deviating Bacteroidetes
Four species classiﬁed in Bacteroides were phylogenetically
neither placed within the phylum Bacteroidetes nor any of
the chosen outgroup phyla, B. coagulans, B. galacturonicus, B.
pectinophilus, and B. xylanolyticus (Figures 1, 2); they were thus
used to root the tree. Additional 16S rRNA gene and GBDP
analyses conﬁrmed the placement of these species at distinct
positions within Eubacteriales (Supplementary Data Sheet 1).
This order within the phylum Firmicutes is perhaps more widely
known as Clostridiales but as long as Eubacterium is included
in the order, it is of relevance that Eubacteriales has priority
(Gerritsen et al., 2014). The four deviant Bacteroides species
are comparatively old and were originally proposed based on
phenotypic features with an emphasis on physiology while
sequencing the 16S rRNA gene or any other genetic marker could
not yet be carried through at that time. Unlike Eubacteriales,
these Bacteroides species were described as Gram-negative. Gram
staining can however change with the age of cultures in some
Eubacteriales (Bryant and Small, 1956) and it is not always
evident from the literature whether the staining reactions were
actually conducted or inferred from general properties of the
genus Bacteroides.
In the 16S rRNA gene tree speciﬁcally inferred to resolve
its
position
(Supplementary Data Sheet 1),
B.
coagulans
(Eggerth and Gagnon, 1932) formed a strongly supported
clade together with Ezakiella peruensis (Patel et al., 2015);
this clade in turn appeared as sister group of Fenollaria
(Pagnier et al., 2014) with almost equally strong support.
While a genome sequence of Ezakiella was not available at the
time of writing, the Eubacteriales GBDP tree conﬁrmed the
sister-group relationship between Fenollaria and B. coagulans
(Supplementary Data Sheet 1). E. peruensis and B. coagulans
share a 16S rRNA gene similarity of 96.15%, which indicates
they do not belong to the same species (Meier-Kolthoﬀet al.,
2013b) but may well be placed in the same genus, which
is the taxonomically most conservative solution and not
precluded by their scarcely recorded phenotypic features
(Supplementary Table 1).
B. pectinophilus (Jensen and Canale-Parola, 1986) shows a
comparatively isolated position within the Eubacteriales 16S
rRNA gene tree with no obvious aﬃliation to an existing genus
(Supplementary Data Sheet 1). In the Eubacteriales GBDP tree
it formed the sister group of a clade comprising Lachnospira
multipara (Bryant and Small, 1956) and the apparently
taxonomically misplaced Eubacterium eligens (Holdeman and
Moore, 1974) and Lactobacillus rogosae (Holdeman and Moore,
1974); this clade in turn appeared as sister group of Coprococcus
eutactus (Holdeman and Moore, 1974). Additional genera only
represented in the 16S rRNA gene tree that could potentially
form a clade together with B. pectinophilus were monotypic
and did not display a particularly high similarity to B.
pectinophilus (Supplementary Data Sheet 1). We conclude that
B. pectinophilus is best assigned to a genus of its own. However,
since the type strain of B. pectinophilus appears to have been
deposited in a single culture collection only, a new combination
for this species name cannot currently be validly published
(Parker et al., 2015).

Genome-Based Taxonomic Classiﬁcation of Bacteroidetes
conservative than establishing a new genus for Lactobacillus
rogosae. Due to the unavailability of the type strain mentioned
in the approved list of bacterial names (Skerman et al., 1980) this
species, however, does not currently seem to be represented by
an extant type strain (Tindall, 2014). While the genome sequence
of Lactobacillus rogosae was obtained from ATCC 27753, this
deposit does not currently appear in the ATCC online catalog.
Although our results conﬁrm previous ones based on the 16S
rRNA gene (Tindall, 2014), further steps are necessary to clarify
the status of the type strain, and we here can only tentatively
suggest the name “Lachnospira rogosae” for Lactobacillus rogosae.
B. xylanolyticus (Scholten-Koerselman et al., 1986) was
shown as sister group of Hungatella eﬄuvii (Kaur et al.,
2014) in the Eubacteriales GBDP tree with strong support
(Supplementary Data Sheet 1),
whereas
the
Eubacteriales
16S rRNA gene placed both in a moderately supported
clade. Interestingly, ﬂagella were reported for B. xylanolyticus
(Scholten-Koerselman et al., 1986) but, as we will reiterate
below, ﬂagella are unlikely in Bacteroidetes, whereas Hungatella
is motile. It should be noted, however, that the report was
apparently not based on a ﬂagellum-speciﬁc staining. The
last emendation of Bacteroides indicated that the genus is
non-motile (Shah and Collins, 1989). The 16S rRNA gene
clade also included a set of apparently misplaced Clostridium
species some of which showed high 16S rRNA gene similarities
to B. xylanolyticus indicating that a DDH value should be
obtained to determine species boundaries (Meier-Kolthoﬀ
et al., 2013b). While genome sequences were available for all
of these Clostridium species that were validly published before
B. xylanolyticus, none of them yielded a dDDH value ≥70%
(Supplementary Table 1). B. xylanolyticus can safely be placed
in Hungatella in this respect, which is not in disagreement with
the scarcely recorded phenotype (Supplementary Table 1) and
also more conservative than establishing a new genus. The
nomenclature of the Clostridium species misplaced in the same
clade, the phenotypically heterogeneous Clostridium group
XIVa (Collins et al., 1994a), is beyond the scope of the current
study, however.
Non-Bacteroidetes Taxa
The outgroup taxa, which were selected in accordance with a
previous study (Hahnke R. L. et al., 2016), were phylogenetically
located at the expected positions in the newly inferred
GBDP tree. For instance, the monophyly of the “Bacteroidota-
Rhodothermota-Balneolota-Chlorobiota superphylum” could be
conﬁrmed (Figure 1). Despite the relatively low size of these taxa,
a couple of taxonomic discrepancies were found.
Within the phylum Nitrospirae, the dDDH value (Table 3)
between Thermodesulfovibrio yellowstonii (Henry et al., 1994)
and T. islandicus (Sonne-Hansen and Ahring, 1999) indicated
that T. islandicus is later heterotypic synonym of the former.
Because of the position of Victivallis (Zoetendal et al.,
2003) Lentisphaerae (Cho et al., 2004), the phyla Lentisphaeria
(Cho J. C. et al., 2011) and Fibrobacteres (Garrity and Holt,
2001) appeared as non-monophyletic but support against their
monophyly was poor (Figure 2). The 16S rRNA gene trees,
the ULT and additional supermatrix analyses supported the
monophyly of these taxa (Supplementary Data Sheet 1), hence
no taxonomic consequences were aimed at because in this respect
the GBDP tree simply seemed to be unresolved.
Within the phylum Deinococcus-Thermus, Deinococcales
(Rainey et al., 1997) appeared as paraphyletic in the GBDP tree
because of the position of Truepera (Albuquerque et al., 2005)
though support to this eﬀect is not high (Figure 2). However,
none of the 16S rRNA gene trees supported the monophyly
of Deinococcales either (Supplementary Data Sheet 1). The ULT
showed Truepera also branching ﬁrst within the phylum
Deinococcus-Thermus with strong support under ML. The
current classiﬁcation already separates Truepera in a family
of its own (Albuquerque et al., 2005) from Deinococccus.
Phylogenetically it seems safer to also place Truepera into an
order of its own, Trueperales ord. nov.
Within the phylum Rhodothermaeota, Rhodothermaceae
(Ludwig et al., 2011a; Hahnke R. L. et al., 2016) appeared
as non-monophyletic in the GBDP tree because Longibacter
salinarum (Xia J. et al., 2016) and Longimonas halophila (Xia
et al., 2015) were located in a maximally supported clade
containing Salinibacter ruber (Antón et al., 2002), Salinivenus
iranica (Makhdoumi-Kakhki et al., 2012; Munoz et al., 2016), and
Salisaeta longa (Vaisman and Oren, 2009) of Salinibacteraceae
(Figure 2,
Supplementary Data Sheet 1).
Longimonas
and
Longibacter were not included in the phylogenetic study when
Salinibacteraceae was proposed (Munoz et al., 2016). Longibacter
and Longimonas diﬀer from the other three genera by their
facultatively anaerobic lifestyle and their lack of oxidase activity
(Supplementary Table 1). However, the position of Longimonas
indicates that its character states are plesiomorphic within
the clade and hence these two characters cannot be used to
separate the ﬁve genera into two families. It is thus proposed that
Longibacter and Longimonas be included in Salinibacteraceae.
Within the class Spartobacteria (Sangwan et al., 2004), to date
Terrimicrobium (Qiu Y.-L. et al., 2014) was not yet assigned to a
family or order. Given its relatively isolated position in the trees
with a considerable genomic divergence from its sister group
(Figure 2, Supplementary Data Sheet 1), Terrimicrobium would
best be assigned to a family of its own in Chthoniobacterales.
However, neither Spartobacteria nor its supposed type order
Chthoniobacterales are validly published names. As type strains
of the type species of the type genus of Chthoniobacterales,
Chthoniobacter ﬂavus, were apparently not deposited in two
culture collections in two distinct countries, there does not seem
to be an easy remedy (Parker et al., 2015). Thus Terrimicrobium,
whose name is validly published, is best placed into a family of
its own in an order of its own in a class of its own within an
accordingly emended phylum Verrucomicrobia (Hedlund, 2011)
to provide names for higher taxa within this clade with a higher
probability of obtaining standing in nomenclature.
Class Saprospiria
The class Saprospiria is a relatively small, aerobic group within
the phylum Bacteroidetes that was only recently recognized
(Hahnke R. L. et al., 2016) as a separate group branching
ﬁrst within the phylum, as conﬁrmed here albeit with limited
branch support, whereas the monophyly of the class was strongly

Lewinellaceae was placed as sister group of Phaeodactylibacter
xiamenensis (Chen Z. et al., 2014) of Haliscomenobacteraceae
with moderate to high support, to the exclusion of the
remaining
Lewinella
species.
Haliscomenobacteraceae
and
Lewinellaceae were recently proposed by splitting Saprospiraceae,
supported by phylogenomic and 16S rRNA gene sequence
analyses and
phenotypic features
(Hahnke R.
L. et
al.,

García-López et al.
Genome-Based Taxonomic Classiﬁcation of Bacteroidetes
2016). Given the position of Saprospiraceae sensu stricto
in the CCT (Supplementary Data Sheet 1) it was assumed
that lack of motility within the order is a synapomorphy
of
Haliscomenobacter,
Phaeodactylibacter,
and
Portibacter,
hence they were placed in the same family but separate from
Lewinella (Lewinellaceae); support against the monophyly of
Haliscomenobacteraceae was low. The inclusion of additional
Lewinella genome sequences, such as the one of the non-
motile L. nigricans, in the present study partially increased
backbone support and yielded a topology that rather indicates
that motility is a homoplastic character within the order.
Thus, it appears preferable to merge Haliscomenobacteraceae
and
Lewinellaceae.
The
phylogenetic
situation
is
indeed
confusing within the order because, unusually, the ULT
and URT yielded moderate to strong support for a distinct
arrangement including a monophyletic Haliscomenobacteraceae
and a monophyletic Lewinella (Supplementary Data Sheet 1).
Additional supermatrix analyses conﬁrmed the GBDP topology
but partially low partition bootstrap support indicated that
within these two families large sets of genes may have had
distinct evolutionary histories. We did not detect any hints of
contamination in the genome of L. nigricans NBRC 102662T,
while the SH test did not indicate a signiﬁcant conﬂict
between the 16S rRNA gene and the supermatrix topology
(Supplementary Table 1).
Given the genomic divergence of Lewinella, L. nigricans
may well be placed in a genus of its own, yielding a
classiﬁcation that would agree with all conﬂicting tree topologies.
Originally, L. nigricans, L. persica and the type species of
Lewinella, L. cohaerens, were reclassiﬁed from Herpetosiphon
(currently assigned to the phylum Chloroﬂexi) because they
formed a well-deﬁned and well-supported clade that was only
distantly related to the type species of Herpetosiphon (Sly
et al., 1998). The phenotype of Haliscomenobacteraceae and
Lewinellacae is quite uniform with the exception of motility
in Lewinella (Supplementary Table 1) but this may be a
homoplastic character, in agreement with the ﬁndings reported
in Table 1. We thus propose to assign L. nigricans to a new
genus of its own, Flavilitoribacter gen, nov., which is also in line
with its higher genome size compared to the other Lewinella
species (Figure 2). It should be noted that the remaining genus
Lewinella is still genomically quite heterogeneous regarding L.
cohaerens but further taxonomic consequences do not appear to
be absolutely necessary.
Class Cytophagia
The class Cytophagia is a largely aerobic subgroup of the
phylum Bacteroidetes, which here was strongly supported as
monophyletic and formed a moderately supported clade together
with Chitinophagia and Sphingobacteriia (Figure 3). Its single
order Cytophagales displayed a small numbers of discrepancies
between the classiﬁcation and the phylogenomic results at the
level of families and genera.
Within Cytophagales, Cytophagaceae (Stanier, 1940) appeared
as non-monophyletic in the GBDP tree (Figure 3) because
Flexibacter ﬂexilis (Soriano, 1945; Hahnke R. L. et al., 2016) was
placed as sister group of Mooreia alkaloidigena (Choi E. J. et al.,
2013) of Mooreiaceae. Support for this arrangement was low
but so was the evidence for the monophyly of Cytophagaceae
in all inferred trees (Supplementary Data Sheet 1). In contrast,
the clade in the CCT corresponding to the clade ranging
from Siphonobacter to Spirosoma in Figure 3 was strongly
supported. This group shows a tendency toward larger genomes
and higher G+C content values compared to Cytophaga
and Sporocytophaga. It would thus appear reasonable to split
Cytophagaceae into a total of three families. Whereas, Flexibacter
ﬂexilis should be placed in a family of its own, an earlier
taxonomic concept already proposed the family Spirosomaceae
to contain Spirosoma, Flectobacillus, and Runella (Larkin and
Borrall, 1978), which all belong to that clade as shown in
Figure 3. We thus suggest to reuse the validly published name
Spirosomaceae as the family for these three genera, in addition to
those proposed after 1978 but phylogenetically located within the
same clade.
Flammeovirgaceae (Yoon J.-H. et al., 2011) appeared as
paraphyletic in the GBDP tree (Figure 3) because Chryseolinea
(Kim J.-J. et al., 2013), Ohtaekwangia (Yoon J.et al., 2011),
and Thermoﬂexibacter (Hahnke R. L. et al., 2016) which were
not yet assigned to a family, Ekhidna lutea (Alain et al., 2010)
of Cytophagaceae, all Bernardetiaceae (Hahnke R. L. et al.,
2016) and all Cyclobacteriaceae (Nedashkovskaya and Ludwig,
2011) were phylogenetically placed within Flammeovirgaceae.
The overall genomic divergence of these taxa argues against
including all of them in a single family, which would also
lack branch support in the tree. In line with the dissection of
Cytophagaceae proposed above it would thus appear reasonable
to split Flammeovirgaceae. Given the uncertain position of
Thermoﬂexibacter (Hahnke R. L. et al., 2016), which has as yet
not been assigned to a family, as sister group of Bernardetiaceae
(Hahnke R. L. et al., 2016), and the comparatively long genomic
distance separating it from that group, Thermoﬂexibacter is best
be assigned to a family of its own, which is not contradicted by the
scarcely known phenotypic features (Supplementary Table 1).
Cesiribacter (Srinivas et al., 2011) and Nafulsella (Zhang L. et al.,
2013) were placed in a strongly supported clade with uncertain
aﬃliations to other clades, indicating the two genera should
best be placed in a separate family. Fulvivirga (Nedashkovskaya
et al., 2007a) formed a clade together with Chryseolinea (Kim
J.-J. et al., 2013) and Ohtaekwangia (Yoon J.et al., 2011), hence
a new family can be proposed to accommodate these genera
(see also Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Data Sheet 1).
As in the GBDP tree, the 16S rRNA gene trees and the
ULT (Supplementary Data Sheet 1) showed Ekhidna lutea in
a clade together with Marinoscillum (Seo et al., 2009) and
Reichenbachiella (Nedashkovskaya et al., 2005f; Cha et al., 2011),
which suggests the classiﬁcation of these three genera into
a new family, which is not precluded by their phenotype
(Supplementary Table 1). Roseivirga (Nedashkovskaya et al.,
2005a,e, 2008a; Selvaratnam et al., 2016) formed a strongly
supported clade together with Fabibacter (Lau et al., 2006a), with
which it was even intermixed as discussed below. The two genera
are best placed in a separate family, Roseivirgaceae fam. nov.
(Supplementary Data Sheet 1).
Roseivirga
(Nedashkovskaya
et
al.,
2005a,e,
2008a;
Selvaratnam et al., 2016) appeared as polyphyletic in the
GBDP tree (Figure 3) because R. spongicola was placed

García-López et al.
Genome-Based Taxonomic Classiﬁcation of Bacteroidetes
within a paraphyletic Fabibacter (Lau et al., 2006a). In the
study that proposed both Fabibacter and R. spongicola (Lau
et al., 2006a), a 16S rRNA gene tree showed F. halotolerans
placed together with two environmental isolates as sister
group of a Roseivirga clade that included R. spongicola but
support for this arrangement was moderate and apparently
only obtained in a neighbor-joining analysis. The ULT and
additional supermatrix analyses conﬁrmed the GBDP topology
instead
(Supplementary Data Sheet 1);
the
URT
also
but
with low support. The SH test indicated a signiﬁcant conﬂict
between the 16S rRNA gene and the supermatrix topology
but the corresponding 16S rRNA gene tree did not show
a monophyletic Roseivirga either (Supplementary Table 1).
Fabibacter and the closely related genus Fabivirga (Tang M.
et al., 2016) show phenotypic characteristics similar to those of
Roseivirga except for the presence of ﬂexirubin-like pigments
in some Roseivirga species (Supplementary Table 1). A single
binary character cannot properly separate two taxa, however,
because it cannot yield an apomorphy for both (Hennig,
1965; Wiley and Lieberman, 2011; Montero-Calasanz et al.,
2017). Moreover, the GBDP topology also indicates that
production of ﬂexirubins is homoplastic in the Fabibacter-
Roseivirga clade (Supplementary Data Sheet 1), in line with
the ﬁndings reported above (Table 1). The CCT and UCT
(Supplementary Data Sheet 1) do not allow for an unambiguous
placement of all species of the two genera, even though it is
obvious that the type species of Fabibacter, F. halotolerans, is
placed within the highly supported clade that also includes
Fabivirga. For this reason, we propose to assign Fabibacter and
Fabivirga into Roseivirga, which has priority, to create a genus
that is unambiguously monophyletic in all examined datasets.
Marivirga (Nedashkovskaya et al., 2010c; Lin et al., 2015)
formed the sister group of Cyclobacteriaceae with strong
support but was phylogenetically distant from this family
and thus may best also be placed into a family of its
own, a solution neither contradicted by analyses of rRNA
genes (Supplementary Data Sheet 1) nor by the phenotype
(Supplementary Table 1). To obtain well-supported families, the
only alternative to splitting Flammeovirgaceae into that many
families is to place most of its genera in Cyclobacteriaceae
thus create a family covering the genera from Nafulsella to
Algoriphagus in Figure 3. However, low support in the CCT
argues against this solution (Supplementary Data Sheet 1). The
phylogenomic analysis indeed shows a series of relatively short
branches descending from the root of the Cytophagales subtree
to form an overall not well-supported backbone, which is better
in agreement with splitting the order into more families than
suggested in the literature.
Class Sphingobacteriia
The class Sphingobacteriia here formed a strongly supported
clade
and
appeared
as
the
sister
group
of
the
class
Chitinophagia with weak support (Figure 4). The largely
aerobic Sphingobacteriia showed some disagreement between the
classiﬁcation and the phylogenomic tree but these were restricted
to the single, relatively species-rich genus Pedobacter.
Indeed, Pedobacter (Steyn et al., 1998; Vanparys et al., 2005;
Gallego et al., 2006; Hwang et al., 2006; Zhou et al., 2012;
Farfán et al., 2014; Kook et al., 2014; Du et al., 2015) appeared
as paraphyletic in the GBDP tree because several species, P.
arcticus (Zhou et al., 2012), P. bauzanensis (Zhang et al., 2010b),
P. glucosidilyticus (Luo et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2012; Hahnke
R. L. et al., 2016), P. luteus (Oh et al., 2013), P. oryza (Jeon
et al., 2009), P. psychrophilus (Švec et al., 2017), and P. ruber
(Margesin and Zhang, 2013) were placed apart from the clade
containing the type species, P. heparinus (Steyn et al., 1998; Zhou
et al., 2012) with high support (Figure 4). The ULT also strongly
supported the paraphyly of Pedobacter; the URT showed the
same albeit with lower support (Supplementary Data Sheet 1).
In the CCT, Pedobacter also appeared as paraphyletic; here
P. composti (Lee H.-G. et al., 2009), P. huanghensis (Qiu X.
et al., 2014), P. luteus, P. oryza, and P. ruber formed an
independent and well-supported clade, whereas P. tournemirensis
(Urios et al., 2013) was placed as sister group of Arcticibacter
(Prasad et al., 2013) with high support. Both clades appeared
more closely related to Mucilaginibacter (Pankratov et al., 2007;
Urai et al., 2008; Baik et al., 2010; Chen X. Y. et al., 2014)
than to P. heparinus. Moreover, P. bauzanensis appeared as
sister group of the clade comprising Olivibacter (Ntougias et al.,
2007) and Pseudosphingobacterium (Vaz-Moreira et al., 2007)
with high support. The UCT did not resolve the monophyly of
Pedobacter (Supplementary Data Sheet 1). This observation is
not in conﬂict with literature statements, since all emendations of
the genus, much like its original description (Steyn et al., 1998),
used a taxon sampling far too restricted to properly demonstrate
whether or not Pedobacter is monophyletic. As detailed
in Supplementary Table 1, there are no obvious phenotypic
diﬀerences between P. tournemirensis and Arcticibacter. Hence,
it is proposed that P. tournemirensis be assigned to Arcticibacter.
In fact, obtaining monophyletic genera by merging all genera
with which Pedobacter is intermixed would almost amount
to placing all Sphingobacteriaceae in a single genus, which
is unwise given the genomic (Figure 4) and phenotypic
(Supplementary Table 1) divergence of the group. For this
reason, we propose a new genus for accommodating P. composti,
P. huanghensis, P. luteus, P. oryza, and P. ruber and another one
to accommodate P. bauzanensis. We are aware of the fact that
this does not solve all known taxonomic problems in Pedobacter
because P. arcticus (Zhou et al., 2012), P. glucosidilyticus (Luo
et al., 2010), and P. psychrophilus (Švec et al., 2017) are more
closely related to Pseudopedobacter (Cao et al., 2014) than to P.
heparinus. However, an accordingly revised genus lacks support
even in the CCT (Supplementary Data Sheet 1). In addition,
in the 16S rRNA gene tree, Nubsella zeaxanthinifaciens (Asker
et al., 2008b) and Pelobium manganitolerans (Xia X. et al., 2016)
were placed within the main Pedobacter clade that included P.
heparinus. However, support for this clade was low. Since genome
sequences for N. zeaxanthinifaciens and P. manganitolerans were
not available at the time of writing, we here refrain from
considering further taxonomic consequences.
Class Chitinophagia
The only recently proposed class Chitinophagia (Munoz et al.,
2016) here formed a strongly supported clade and appeared as
the sister group of the class Sphingobacteriia with weak support
(Figure 4). The largely aerobic Chitinophagia showed few

García-López et al.
Genome-Based Taxonomic Classiﬁcation of Bacteroidetes
discrepancies between the classiﬁcation and the phylogenomic
tree, which were restricted to the level of the genera.
The
GBDP
and
rRNA
gene
trees
(Figure 4,
Supplementary Data Sheet 1) show that Crenotalea (Hanada
et al., 2014) and Thermoﬂaviﬁlum (Anders et al., 2014)
form a clade which stands out as its genetic divergence is
lower than that of adjacent clades, including closely related
ones corresponding to individual genera, as exempliﬁed by
Chinitophaga. The dDDH value between the two species,
which were proposed independently at about the same time
to belong to two distinct genera, amounted to 37.8%, which
is quite high for species assigned to distinct genera. Because
Crenotalea and Thermoﬂaviﬁlum also show almost identical
phenotypic characteristics, including chemotaxonomic markers
such as fatty acids (Supplementary Table 1), it is proposed
that
Crenotalea
be
included
in
Thermoﬂaviﬁlum,
which
has priority.
Sediminibacterium (Qu and Yuan, 2008; Kim Y.-J. et al., 2013)
appeared as paraphyletic in the GBDP tree (Figure 4) because the
clade comprising Hydrobacter penzbergensis (Eder et al., 2015)
and Vibrionimonas magnilacihabitans (Albert et al., 2014) was
placed as sister group of S. ginsengisoli (Kim Y.-J. et al., 2013)
with high support. Whereas, the ULT showed a monophyletic
Sediminibacterium with strong support, additional supermatrix
analyses conﬁrmed the GBDP topology with respect to a
paraphyletic Sediminibacterium (Supplementary Data Sheet 1).
The SH test indicated a signiﬁcant conﬂict between the 16S rRNA
gene and the supermatrix topology (Supplementary Table 1). In
the CCT, H. penzbergensis and V. magnilacihabitans were placed
within Sediminibacterium, along with Asinibacterium lactis (Lee
D.-G. et al., 2013), which formed their sister group with high
support. When A. lactis and H. penzbergensis were proposed,
only the type species of Sediminibacterium was considered
for the phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences,
which also yielded low support for the interrelationships
between these genera, hence monophyly of Sediminibacterium
could not be guaranteed further. When H. penzbergensis was
proposed, V. magnilacihabitans was not considered; as shown in
Table 3, H. penzbergensis is a later heterotypic synonym of V.
magnilacihabitans. These two genera as well as Asinibacterium
(Lee D.-G. et al., 2013) and even Hydrotalea (Kämpfer et al.,
2011b; Albuquerque et al., 2012) and Parasediminibacterium
(Kang et al., 2016) display phenotypic features similar to those
of Sediminibacterium, the only known diﬀerences being presence
or absence of motility, which may well be homoplastic given
the ﬁndings reported above (Table 1), and a negative response
for oxidase and catalase activities reported for Asinibacterium
(Supplementary Table 1). Consequently, it is proposed that
Asinibacterium lactis and Vibrionimonas magnilacihabitans be
classiﬁed within Sediminibacterium.
Class Bacteroidia
The mainly anaerobic Bacteroidia formed a strongly supported
clade and appeared as the sister group of the class Flavobacteriia
with weak support (Figure 4). Bacteroidia showed several
discrepancies between the classiﬁcation and the phylogenomic
tree, which aﬀected orders, families, or genera.
Marinilabiliales (Wu et al., 2016) and Bacteroidales (Krieg,
2011b; Pikuta et al., 2017) appeared as paraphyletic in the GBDP
tree (Figure 5) for a variety of reasons even if one disregards
the completely misplaced Bacteroides species discussed above
and the placement of Cytophaga xylanolytica, which is treated
below. For instance, Balneicella halophila (Fadhlaoui et al., 2016)
of Balneicellaceae within Bacteroidales was phylogenetically
placed within Marinilabiliales. When Balneicella was proposed,
it appeared as neighbor to Mariniﬁlum which at that time
was assigned to Bacteroidales instead of Marinilabiliales. As
detailed in Supplementary Table 1, according to the respective
taxon descriptions Balneicellaceae can only be diﬀerentiated
from Marinilabiliales by the tolerance of the former toward
oxygen (aerobic or facultatively anaerobic vs. strictly anaerobic)
and a distinct major menaquinone (MK-7 vs. MK-6) but the
real taxonomic value of these diﬀerences is diﬃcult to judge
from the taxonomic literature because it was not indicated
which state of which character is apomorphic. As implied
by the results shown in Table 1 and the GBDP topology,
MK-7 is plesiomorphic in Bacteroidetes, hence MK-6 is
simply an autapomorphy of Balneicellaceae; equivalent logic
prohibits using the oxygen relationship to separate the two
taxa. Moreover, a variety of taxa assigned to Marinilabiliales
were described as facultatively anaerobic instead of strictly
anaerobic
(Supplementary Data Sheet 1).
Marinilabiliales
appeared monophyletic neither in the URT nor in the ULT
(Supplementary Data Sheet 1). While one could taxonomically
assign Balneicellaceae to Marinilabiliales, Marinilabiliales, and
Bacteroidales also appeared as phylogenetically intermixed with
respect
to
the
position
of
Butyricimonas,
Gabonibacter,
Odoribacter,
Rikenellaceae,
and
Williamwhitmaniaceae
(Figure 5,
Supplementary Data Sheet 1).
Bootstrap
support
was low in the 16S rRNA tree that was used for proposing
Marinilabiales (Wu et al., 2016). Likewise, within the GBDP
tree, the support for the backbone of the Bacteroidia subtree was
low except for Bacteroidales sensu stricto. In this respect, the
phylogenetically safest solution is to not retain Marinilabiliales
and to place all Bacteroidia families within Bacteroidales.
This also provides a taxonomically conservative solution
for Lentimicrobiaceae (Sun et al., 2016), which was as yet
not assigned to any order or class and can now be included
in Bacteroidales.
Rikenellaceae (Krieg et al., 2010b) appeared as paraphyletic
in
the
GBDP
and
16S
rRNA
gene
trees
(Figure 5,
Supplementary Data Sheet 1)
because
Williamwhitmania
taraxaci (Pikuta et al., 2017) of Williamwhitmaniaceae was
placed as a sister group of Acetobacteroides hydrogenigenes (Su
et al., 2014) of Rikenellaceae with strong support. When
Williamwhitmania
was
proposed,
Acetobacteroides
was
not considered in the phylogenetic analysis. Rikenellaceae
and
Williamwhitmania
share
many
of
their
phenotypic
properties except for the cellular motility of Williamwhitmania
(Supplementary Table 1). Motility is incompletely reported for
these genera; if all except Williamwhitmania were non-motile,
being non-motile would be plesiomorphic and could not be
used to justify a taxon. According to the results reported
above (Table 1) the character may also be homoplastic. The

clade comprising both Williamwhitmania and Rikenellaceae
shows

hence
it is phylogenetically preferable to place Acetobacteroides
in Williamwhitmaniaceae.
Mariniﬁlaceae (Iino et al., 2014) was recently emended
(Ormerod et al., 2016) to include Odoribacter (Hardham
et al., 2008) and Butyricimonas (Sakamoto et al., 2009b, 2014),
previously classiﬁed within Porphyromonadaceae. Concurrently,
another study (Munoz et al., 2016) proposed the new family
Odoribacteraceae within Bacteroidales to contain Odoribacter
and Butyricimonas, a family that was emended later on
(Hahnke R. L. et al., 2016). According to our analysis,
Butyricimonas synergistica (Sakamoto et al., 2009b, 2014;
Hahnke R. L. et al., 2016), B. virosa (Sakamoto et al., 2009b,
2014; Hahnke R. L. et al., 2016), Odoribacter laneus (Nagai
et al., 2010; Hahnke R. L. et al., 2016), and O. splanchnicus
(Hardham et al., 2008; Hahnke R. L. et al., 2016) form a
well-supported group together with Gabonibacter massiliensis
(Mourembou et al., 2016) set apart from Mariniﬁlaceae, which
was strongly supported as sister group of Balneicellaceae
(Figure 5). Mariniﬁlaceae also appeared as paraphyletic in the
UCT and ULT (Supplementary Data Sheet 1). Therefore, our
results corroborate the earlier proposal (Munoz et al., 2016) and
do not support the alternative taxonomic framework proposed
later on (Ormerod et al., 2016), which may have been caused by
insuﬃcient taxon sampling. Gabonibacter massiliensis, which is
currently taxonomically placed in Porphyromonadaceae, presents
phenotypic features similar to those of Odoribacteraceae with
the exception of being motile (Supplementary Table 1). Motility
is incompletely reported for these genera, however, and, given
the phylogenetic position of Gabonibacter, non-motility would
be plesiomorphic in the clade if all other genera were non-
motile. Yet a single character with two states should indeed
never be used to separate two taxa (Hennig, 1965; Wiley and
Lieberman, 2011; Montero-Calasanz et al., 2017). It would not
be surprising either if being motile was a homoplastic character
in this group (Table 1). We thus propose to place Gabonibacter
in Odoribacteraceae.
Labilibacter (Lu et al., 2017) appeared as paraphyletic
in
the
GBDP
and
rRNA
gene
trees
(Figure 5,
Supplementary Data Sheet 1)
because
Saccharicrinis
(Liu
et al., 2014b; Yang S.-H. et al., 2014) formed the sister group of
L. marinus (Lu et al., 2017) with high support. While originally
placed in Saccharicrinis as S. marinus (Liu Q.-Q. et al., 2015),
it had been reclassiﬁed in Labilibacter in a study in which a
16S rRNA gene tree showed it to form a clade together with
the type species of Labilibacter, in contrast to our phylogenetic
analyses. Some phenotypic diﬀerences such as temperature
range for growth and fatty acids (Supplementary Table 1)
were proposed as suggestive of separating the two genera (Lu
et al., 2017) but it was not clariﬁed which character states were
apomorphies of which taxon. The known polar-lipid spectra
are basically identical between the two genera. While the URT
showed the same topology as the previously published 16S rRNA
gene analyses, additional supermatrix analyses unambiguously
conﬁrmed L. marinus as more closely related to Saccharicrinis
than to L. aurantiacus (Supplementary Data Sheet 1). The SH
test indicated a signiﬁcant conﬂict between the 16S rRNA gene
and the supermatrix topology (Supplementary Table 1). In the
case of L. marinus, this simply implies the synonym S. marinus
should be preferred. However, since here the 16S rRNA gene is
in signiﬁcant conﬂict with genome-scale data, which is highly
unusual, we also propose to include the entire genus Labilibacter
in Saccharicrinis in order to allow 16S rRNA gene trees to agree
with the taxonomic classiﬁcation.
Cytophaga xylanolytica (Haack and Breznak, 1993) of
Cytophagaceae was phylogenetically placed within a paraphyletic
Marinilabiliaceae where it formed a relatively isolated lineage
(Figure 5,
Supplementary Data Sheet 1),
which
also
made
Cytophaga (Winogradsky, 1929; Nakagawa and Yamasato,
1996) appear as paraphyletic. C. xylanolytica was originally
proposed on basis of phenotypic characteristics without taking
into account the 16S rRNA gene sequence as phylogenetic
marker (only few “signature nucleotides” were examined).
Later 16S rRNA gene analyses indicated that the species
should better not be placed in Cytophaga (Nakagawa, 2011b).
In a comparison with other currently accepted taxa C.
xylanolytica displays phenotypic characteristics similar to those
of Marinilabiliaceae (Supplementary Table 1) but apparently
does not phylogenetically belong to any of its known genera.
Thus, it is proposed that C. xylanolytica be assigned to a new
genus, Breznakibacter gen. nov., within Marinilabiliaceae.
Dysgonomonadaceae (Ormerod et al., 2016) appeared as
polyphyletic in the GBDP and rRNA gene trees (Figure 5,
Supplementary Data Sheet 1) because Fermentimonas (Hahnke
S. et al., 2016) and Petrimonas (Grabowski et al., 2005), both
classiﬁed in Porphyromonadaceae, were placed as a sister
group of Proteiniphilum (Chen and Dong, 2005; Hahnke S.
et al., 2016) of Dysgonomonadaceae with maximum support.
When the name Dysgonomonadaceae was proposed, Petrimonas
was
not
considered,
while
Fermentimonas
was
proposed
independently at about the same time as Dysgonomonadaceae.
Our
suggestion
to
transfer
Fermentimonas
(Hahnke
S.
et al., 2016) and Petrimonas (Grabowski et al., 2005) to
Dysgonomonadaceae (Ormerod et al., 2016) is not contradicted
by the phenotype (Supplementary Table 1). To date the name
Dysgonomonadaceae does not seem to have been validated,
which may be caused by a formally incomplete description
(Parker et al., 2015), which we attempt to ﬁx below.
Muribaculum (Lagkouvardos et al., 2016) has as yet not
been formally assigned to a family even though its authors
suggested the not validly published name “Muribaculaceae.”
Given its position as sister group of Barnesiellaceae in the
GBDP tree (Figure 5) and its position within Barnesiallaceae
in the UCT, ULT, and URT (Supplementary Data Sheet 1)
we propose to place it in the family Barnesiellaceae. While
the UCT and URT even showed a paraphyletic Coprobacter
(Shkoporov et al., 2013) with relatively strong support due to
the position of Muribaculum, additional supermatrix analyses
conﬁrmed the GBDP topology, and the SH tests did not indicate
a signiﬁcant conﬂict between the 16S rRNA gene and the
supermatrix topology. However, not establishing a new family for
Muribaculum is the taxonomically more conservative solution
in either case. To date the name Barnesiellaceae does not seem

García-López et al.
Genome-Based Taxonomic Classiﬁcation of Bacteroidetes
to have been validated, which may be caused by a formally
incomplete description (Parker et al., 2015), which we attempt
to ﬁx below.
Prevotellaceae (Krieg, 2010) appeared as polyphyletic in
the GBDP tree (Figure 5) because Prevotella zoogleoformans
(Weinberg et al., 1937; Shah and Collins, 1990; Moore et al., 1994)
was placed within Bacteroides of Bacteroidaceae. In the CCT
and the UCT (Supplementary Data Sheet 1) P. heparinolytica
(Okuda et al., 1985; Shah and Collins, 1990) formed the sister
group of P. zoogleoformans while the clade comprising both
was placed as sister group to B. helcogenes (Benno et al., 1983;
Hahnke R. L. et al., 2016). P. heparinolytica and P. zoogleoformans
were removed from Bacteroides in an earlier study (Shah and
Collins, 1990) based on their morphological, physiological, and
biochemical characteristics but without taking into account
16S rRNA gene sequences. Whereas, this had been noted as
problematic early on (Olsen and Shah, 2001), the later taxonomic
literature was undecided on whether placing the two species
in Bacteroides (Willems and Collins, 1995) or Prevotella (Olsen
and Shah, 2008). Phylogenomic analyses rather clearly indicate
that Prevotella heparinolytica and P. zoogleoformans should
better retain their earlier names Bacteroides heparinolyticus and
B. zoogleoformans.
Even aside from these two Prevotella species and the
four completely misplaced Bacteroides species treated above,
Bacteroides (Castellani and Chalmers, 1919; Shah and Collins,
1989) appeared as non-monophyletic in the GBDP tree
(Figure 5) because Phocaeicola abscessus (Al Masalma et al.,
2009) was placed within Bacteroides. In the original description of
Phocaeicola abscessus, the type strain of the species was grouped
with three environmental clones, along with Prevotella species,
but supported by a low bootstrap value, as sister group of a couple
of Bacteroides species. However, the type species of Bacteroides, B.
fragilis, was not included in the phylogenetic analysis. According
to our results, B. barnesiae, B. caecicola, B. caecigallinarum, B.
chinchillae, B. coprocola B. coprophilus, B. dorei, B. gallinaceum, B.
massiliensis, B. paurosaccharolyticus, B. plebeius, B. salanitronis,
B. sartorii, B. vulgatus are phylogenetically more closely related
to Phocaeicola than to B. fragilis (Supplementary Data Sheet 1).
We did not ﬁnd a consistent phenotypic diﬀerence between
Phocaeicola and these Bacteroides species except for cell
motility in the former (Supplementary Table 1). While cells
of Phocaeicola were reported to produce ﬂagella, we would
interpret the structure shown in the original picture, which was
apparently not based on a ﬂagellum-speciﬁc staining, rather
as exopolysaccharides, which, in contrast to ﬂagella, are well-
known from Bacteroidetes (Krieg et al., 2010a). Moreover, even
if Phocaeicola was motile, given the tree topology motility
would be an autapomorphy of Phocaeicola, whereas being non-
motile would be plesiomorphic and hence could not be used
to justify the current separation of Phocaeicola from Bacteroides
(Hennig, 1965; Wiley and Lieberman, 2011; Montero-Calasanz
et al., 2017). It can neither be ruled out that motility was a
homoplastic character in this group (Table 1). Regarding the
overall genomic divergence of Bacteroides, particularly compared
to other genera of Bacteroidetes (Figure 1), it does not make
much sense to merge Bacteroides with Phocaeicola. Thus,
we propose to assign the Bacteroides species listed above to
Phocaeicola, which in turn should be included in Bacteroidaceae.
The UCT, ULT, and URT do not fully resolve the position of
Phocaeicola but show this genus together with the deviating
Bacteroides species as more closely related to Prevotellaceae than
to B. fragilis (Supplementary Data Sheet 1). Because additional
supermatrix analyses conﬁrmed the GBDP topology regarding
the relationship between Phocaeicola and Bacteroidaceae and SH
tests did not indicate a signiﬁcant conﬂict between supermatrix
and 16S rRNA gene trees (Supplementary Table 1), placing the
genus into this family appears appropriate.
Hallella seregens (Moore and Moore, 1994; Hahnke R. L. et al.,
2016) is known as a later heterotypic synonym of Prevotella
dentalis (Willems and Collins, 1995; Hahnke R. L. et al., 2016).
Accordingly, the two type strains displayed a >79% dDDH
similarity (Table 3).
Class Flavobacteriia
The mainly aerobic Flavobacteriia were shown as monophyletic
with strong support and appeared as the sister group of the
class Bacteroidia with weak support (Figure 4). Flavobacteriia,
which are at present not subdivided into distinct orders,
showed a variety discrepancies between the classiﬁcation and the
phylogenomic tree, mainly with regard to genus boundaries but
also with respect to one family.
In fact, Flavobacteriaceae (Reichenbach, 1989; Bernardet et al.,
1996, 2002) appeared as paraphyletic in the GBDP tree, ULT,
and URT (Figures 6–8, Supplementary Data Sheet 1) because
Ichthyobacterium of Ichthyobacteriaceae (Takano et al., 2016) was
placed as sister group to one of the two major clades into which
Flavobacteriaceae appeared to be split. The overall genomic
divergence also supports splitting the species-rich and genus-
rich family Flavobacteriaceae by assigning the clade that contains
genera ranging from Ornithobacterium to Chryseobacterium
in Figure 6 to a separate family. Whereas, the remaining
Flavobacteriaceae are frequently motile, this distinct clade is
almost entirely non-motile; this alone would not be an argument
for the separation (Table 1) but other phenotypic features do not
provide evidence against the split (Supplementary Table 1). We
thus propose Weeksellaceae, fam. nov., to accommodate those
Flavobacteriaceae that did not form a clade together with the type
genus, Flavobacterium, to the exclusion of Ichthyobacterium. The
clade corresponding to Weeksellaceae obtained strong support in
the CCT and even in the UCT (Supplementary Data Sheet 1);
only Spongiimonas (Yoon J. et al., 2013) is apparently more
diﬃcult to assign to a family within Flavobacteriales with 16S
rRNA gene data; it is strongly supported as belonging to
Weeksellaceae fam. nov. only under MP and thus tentatively also
assigned to the family.
Chryseobacterium (Vandamme et al., 1994; Kämpfer et al.,
2009; Wu et al., 2013; Montero-Calasanz et al., 2014; Chen
et al., 2015; Hahnke R. L. et al., 2016) appeared as paraphyletic
in the GBDP tree (Figure 6) because Soonwooa buanensis
(Joung et al., 2010) was placed within it. S. buanensis and
S. purpurea (Sirra et al., 2017) were also clustered within
Chryseobacterium in the 16S rRNA gene tree but with
low support (Supplementary Data Sheet 1). When Soonwooa

García-López et al.
Genome-Based Taxonomic Classiﬁcation of Bacteroidetes
was proposed (Joung et al., 2010), many Chryseobacterium
species were omitted from the 16S rRNA gene tree, which
may have caused the two genera to appear as separate.
Based on our comprehensive analysis we conclude that
Soonwooa buanensis and S. purpurea should be classiﬁed in
Chryseobacterium. Soonwooa (Joung et al., 2010; Sirra et al., 2017)
and Chryseobacterium (Vandamme et al., 1994; Kämpfer et al.,
2009; Wu et al., 2013; Montero-Calasanz et al., 2014; Chen et al.,
2015; Hahnke R. L. et al., 2016) cannot be diﬀerentiated based on
their phenotypic characteristics (Supplementary Table 1) either.
We are aware of the fact that even with this modiﬁcation
the taxonomic classiﬁcation of Chryseobacterium remains
unsatisfactory because its relationships to the most closely
related genera are not fully resolved (Figure 6). However, the
comprehensive 16S rRNA gene trees are even less resolved
(Supplementary Data Sheet 1), which would preclude robust
assignment of species after splitting Chryseobacterium into
more narrowly deﬁned genera. As more genome sequences
become available, it may be possible to restore some genera
that have been incorporated into Chryseobacterium, such
as Epilithonimonas (O’Sullivan et al., 2006), Kaistella (Kim
et al., 2004), Planobacterium (Peng et al., 2009), and Sejongia
(Yi et al., 2005).
As for the species boundaries in this clade (Figure 6), based
on the dDDH values (Table 3) Chryseobacterium greenlandense
(Loveland-Curtze et al., 2010; Hahnke R. L. et al., 2016) and
Elizabethkingia endophytica (Kämpfer et al., 2015b) should
better be classiﬁed as Chryseobacterium aquaticum subsp.
greenlandense comb. nov., Elizabethkingia anophelis subsp.
endophytica comb. nov., respectively.
Flavobacterium (Bergey et al., 1923; Bernardet et al., 1996;
Dong et al., 2013; Kang et al., 2013; Kuo et al., 2013) appeared as
paraphyletic in the GBDP tree (Figure 7). Flexibacter aurantiacus
(Lewin, 1969), which was placed as sister group of Flavobacterium
johnsoniae (Bernardet et al., 1996; Kim et al., 2012; Chen et al.,
2013a) had already been proposed as heterotypic synonym of F.
johnsoniae in an earlier study (Bernardet et al., 1996). According
to the dDDH value (Table 3) F. aurantiacus is best assigned to
a subspecies of F. johnsoniae. Moreover, Myroides (Vancanneyt
et al., 1996; Yan et al., 2012) was placed within Flavobacterium,
as sister group of the clade comprising F. marinum (Song et al.,
2013) and F. ummariense (Lata et al., 2012). The ULT conﬁrmed
Flavobacterium as paraphyletic (Supplementary Data Sheet 1).
In the CCT, F. anatoliense (Kacagan et al., 2013), F. ceti (Vela
et al., 2007; Lata et al., 2012; Kacagan et al., 2013), and F.
cloacae (Liu et al., 2017) were also more closely related to
Myroides than to the type species, F. aquatile. When the species
F. anatoliense, F. marinum, and F. ummariense were proposed,
Myroides was not considered in the phylogenetic analysis. In the
original description of F. ceti and F. cloacae, several Myroides
species were included in the phylogenetic analysis, but here
Flavobacterium already appeared paraphyletic. More recently
published 16S rRNA gene analyses show the same pattern
but with low support (Hahnke et al., 2015). Flavobacterium
(Bernardet and Bowman, 2006) and Myroides (Hugo et al., 2006)
do not display consistent phenotypic diﬀerences from each other
(Supplementary Table 1). For instance, it is not surprising that
motility is a homoplastic character in this group (Table 1). While
Myroides was originally described as non-motile (Vancanneyt
et al., 1996) the last emendation took into account that M.
profundi is motile by gliding (Yan et al., 2012). Motility is known
to be variable in Flavobacterium (Bernardet et al., 2002). Merging
Myroides and Flavobacterium does not seem to be advisable
given the considerable overall genomic divergence of the group
(Figure 7). Therefore, we propose the reclassiﬁcation of F.
anatoliense, F. ceti, F. cloacae, F. marinum, and F. ummariense
into an emended genus Myroides, which is taxonomically more
conservative than placing these species into a new genus.
As for the species boundaries in this clade, the dDDH values
(Table 3) indicated that Myroides xuanwuensis (Zhang Z.-D.
et al., 2014) should better be classiﬁed as M. odoratimimus subsp.
xuanwuensis comb. nov. Moreover, Flavobacterium spartansii
(Loch and Faisal, 2014b) appeared as later heterotypic synonym
of F. tructae (Zamora et al., 2014).
Muricauda (Bruns et al., 2001; Yoon et al., 2005; Hwang et al.,
2009) appeared as paraphyletic in the GBDP tree (Figure 7)
because Flagellimonas (Bae et al., 2007; Yoon and Oh, 2012)
and Spongiibacterium (Yoon and Oh, 2012; Gao X. et al.,
2015) were placed as sister group to M. paciﬁca (Zhang et al.,
2015a) with moderate support and within Muricauda with
maximum support. The 16S rRNA gene tree in the original
description of M. paciﬁca was already unresolved regarding
Muricauda monophyly, much like the UCT, ULT and URT
(Supplementary Data Sheet 1). Phenotypic diﬀerences between
Spongiibacterium ﬂavum, S. paciﬁcum, Flagellimonas eckloniae,
and Muricauda are not pronounced (Supplementary Table 1).
Although F. eckloniae (Bae et al., 2007) was originally described
as motile by means of a single ﬂagellum, in contrast to the other
genera, this conclusion was not based on a direct inspection
of the ﬂagellum through a speciﬁc staining. Given the general
lack of ﬂagella in Bacteroidetes and the published micrograph we
interpret the structure formed by F. eckloniae as an appendage.
In the light of these results, we propose to include Flagellimonas
and Spongiibacterium in Muricauda, which has priority. This
solution appears to be preferable compared to a recent proposal
that only transferred Spongiibacterium to Flagellimonas (Choi
et al., 2018). Additional supermatrix analyses indeed conﬁrmed
that Flagellimonas and Spongiibacterium are nested within
Muricauda, whereas Croceitalea (Lee et al., 2008; Yoon and Oh,
2012; Su et al., 2017) and Croceivirga (Hu et al., 2017) form
independent lineages (Supplementary Data Sheet 1). Whereas,
the SH tests indicated a signiﬁcant conﬂict between the best
supermatrix and best 16S rRNA gene ML trees, the latter
also showed Spongiibacterium and Flagellimonas nested within
Muricauda (Supplementary Table 1).
Maribacter (Nedashkovskaya et al., 2004a, 2010a; Barbeyron
et al., 2008; Lo et al., 2013; Weerawongwiwat et al., 2013;
Hu et al., 2015; Jackson et al., 2015) appeared as paraphyletic
in GBDP tree (Figure 7) because Maribacter polysiphoniae
(Nedashkovskaya et al., 2007d) and Maribacter vaceletii (Jackson
et al., 2015) were placed apart from the main Maribacter
clade that included the type species, M. sedimenticola. In the
CCT, Maripseudobacter aurantiacus (Chen et al., 2017) and
Pibocella ponti (Nedashkovskaya et al., 2005b) appeared nested

García-López et al.
Genome-Based Taxonomic Classiﬁcation of Bacteroidetes
within Maribacter. But low support even in the CCT precluded
identifying better genus boundaries, hence the taxonomy of this
genus will need to be revisited once more genome sequences
become available.
Aequorivita (Bowman and Nichols, 2002; Park et al., 2009;
Hahnke R. L. et al., 2016) appeared as paraphyletic in the GBDP
and rRNA gene trees (Figure 8, Supplementary Data Sheet 1)
because Vitellibacter aquimaris (Thevarajoo et al., 2016) was
placed as sister group of A. vladivostokensis (Hahnke R. L.
et al., 2016). V. aquimaris was proposed at about the same
time as the reclassiﬁcation of the entire genus Vitellibacter in
Aequorivita in an earlier study (Hahnke R. L. et al., 2016). We
did not detect any pronounced phenotypic diﬀerences between
V. aquimaris and Aequorivita (Supplementary Table 1) while
the dDDH similarity between the two strains (39.9%) did not
indicate that V. aquimaris and A. vladivostokensis belong to the
same species. Consequently, it is proposed that V. aquimaris be
classiﬁed in Aequorivita.
Their high dDDH similarity indicates that Nonlabens
sediminis (Yi and Chun, 2012) is a later heterotypic synonym
of N. tegetincola (Lau et al., 2005). Moreover, according to
the dDDH value (Table 3), Mesoﬂavibacter sabulilitoris (Park
et al., 2014) should better be classiﬁed as Mesoﬂavibacter
zeaxanthinifaciens subsp. sabulilitoris comb. nov.
Mesoﬂavibacter (Asker et al., 2007) appeared as paraphyletic
in GBDP tree (Figure 8) because the type species of the
genus, M. zeaxanthinifaciens (Asker et al., 2007), along with
M. sabulilitoris (Park et al., 2014) were more closely related
to Olleya (Nichols et al., 2005) than to M. aestuarii (Lee J.
H. et al., 2014). When M. aestuarii and M. sabulilitoris were
proposed, Mesoﬂavibacter appeared as monophyletic and as
sister group to Olleya and Lacinutrix, but bootstrap support
was low. Similarly, the ULT and URT do not resolve the
monophyly of Mesoﬂavibacter (Supplementary Data Sheet 1).
Genomically, M. aestuarii appears to be quite distant from M.
zeaxanthinifaciens, and the GBDP topology would imply to place
species from four genera into a single one to keep M. aestuarii and
M. zeaxanthinifaciens in the same monophyletic genus. Thus, it
is proposed to place M. aestuarii into a genus of its own.
Bizionia (Nedashkovskaya et al., 2005d; Li et al., 2015;
Shakeela et al., 2015b) appeared as polyphyletic in the GBDP
tree (Figure 8) because B. echini (Nedashkovskaya et al.,
2010b) and B. argentinensis (Bercovich et al., 2008) were
obviously more closely related to Hanstruepera neustonica
(Hameed et al., 2015) than to the type species B. paragorgiae
(Nedashkovskaya et al., 2005d). In the 16S rRNA gene tree
(Supplementary Data Sheet 1), these two deviating Bizionia
species
formed
a
well-supported
clade
together
with
B.
algoritergicola (Bowman and Nichols, 2005), B. hallyeonensis
(Yoon J.-H. et al., 2013), B. myxarmorum (Bowman and Nichols,
2005), B. psychrotolerans (Song et al., 2014), and B. sediminis
(Zhang et al., 2017). Whereas, this clade was usually well-
supported, support for the monophyly of the entire genus
Bizionia was already lacking in the published 16S rRNA gene
trees used for describing the most recent species. Obtaining
monophyletic genera by merging all intermixed genera with
Bizionia would amount to a huge number of changes and
also seems inappropriate given the genomic (Figure 8) and
phenotypic (Supplementary Table 1) divergence of the group. It
would also be unwise to place the aberrant Bizionia species in
Hanstruepera because further genera may be placed more closely
to either group (Supplementary Data Sheet 1). Therefore, a
new genus is proposed to accommodate B. algoritergicola, B.
argentinensis, B. echini, B. hallyeonensis, B. myxarmorum, B.
psychrotolerans, and B. sediminis. It should be noted that this
may not solve all taxonomic problems in the genus because the
phylogenetic placement of B. arctica (Li et al., 2015) is uncertain
relative to the well-supported clade of remaining species
that includes B. paragorgiae (Supplementary Data Sheet 1).
However, alternative placements are uncertain as well, hence we
refrain from further taxonomic consequences until the genome
sequence of B. arctica becomes available.
Lacinutrix (Bowman and Nichols, 2005; Nedashkovskaya
et al., 2016) appeared polyphyletic in the GBDP tree (Figure 8)
because L. himadriensis (Srinivas et al., 2013) was more
closely related to Oceanihabitans sediminis than to L. algicola
(Nedashkovskaya et al., 2008b), L. mariniﬂava (Nedashkovskaya
et al., 2008b), L. jangbogonensis (Lee Y. M. et al., 2014),
and L. venerupis (Lasa et al., 2015), which formed a well-
supported clade. While a genome sequence for the type strain
of the type species, L. copepodicola (Bowman and Nichols,
2005), was not available at the time of writing, the CCT
conﬁdently placed it as sister group of L. himadriensis. The
phylogenetically separate species L. algicola, L. mariniﬂava, L.
jangbogonensis, and L. venerupis display similar phenotypic
features (Supplementary Table 1) and thus can well be placed
in a separate genus. L. iliipiscaria (Nedashkovskaya et al., 2016)
may also belong to that group even though support for this
arrangement was low. L. iliipiscaria had been reclassiﬁed from
Flavirhabdus (Shakeela et al., 2015b) into Lacinutrix based on a
poorly resolved 16S rRNA gene tree. For this reason, Flavirhabdus
may be the appropriate genus name for the ﬁve deviating
Lacinutrix species but this conclusion must be postponed
until the genome sequence of the key species L. iliipiscaria
becomes available.
Formosa (Ivanova et al., 2004; Nedashkovskaya et al.,
2006b; Shakeela et al., 2015b) appeared as paraphyletic in
the GBDP tree (Figure 8) because Formosa spongicola (Yoon
and Oh, 2011) was conﬁdently placed as sister group of
Xanthomarina gelatinilytica (Vaidya et al., 2015). When X.
gelatinilytica was proposed, a 16S rRNA gene tree was presented
in which it appeared as the sister group of an unresolved
clade comprising Formosa and some of the included Bizionia
species. The ULT and additional supermatrix analyses conﬁrmed
the GBDP topology instead, while the CCT, UCT, and URT
were unresolved (Supplementary Data Sheet 1). The SH test
indicated a signiﬁcant conﬂict between the 16S rRNA gene
and the supermatrix topology. F. spongicola and Xanthomarina
(Yoon and Oh, 2011; Vaidya et al., 2015) show similar phenotypic
characteristics with the exception of motility in F. spongicola
(Supplementary Table 1). However, as emphasized elsewhere
(Hennig, 1965; Wiley and Lieberman, 2011; Montero-Calasanz
et al., 2017) a single character with two states is insuﬃcient
to properly separate two taxa because it cannot provide an

Genome-Based Taxonomic Classiﬁcation of Bacteroidetes
apomorphy for both. Moreover, motility could be a homoplastic
character in this clade (Table 1). We thus propose to include F.
spongicola in Xanthomarina.
Algibacter (Nedashkovskaya et al., 2004b, 2007c; Park
et al., 2013d; Shakeela et al., 2015b) appeared as non-
monophyletic in the GBDP and rRNA gene trees (Figure 8,
Supplementary Data Sheet 1) since distinct Algibacter species
were grouped with genera such as Arenitalea (Zhang X.-Y.
et al., 2013), Conﬂuentibacter (Park et al., 2016; Han et al.,
2017b), Flaviramulus (Einen and Øvreås, 2006; Zhang Y. et al.,
2013), Flavivirga (Yi et al., 2012; Shakeela et al., 2015b),
and Tamlana (Lee, 2007; Jeong et al., 2013b) rather than
with each other. Flaviramulus and Tamlana neither appeared
as monophyletic. However, due to the low support of the
branches, particularly in the comprehensive 16S rRNA gene
trees (Supplementary Data Sheet 1) it would be diﬃcult to infer
taxonomic conclusions at the moment. Additional supermatrix
analyses did not provide more resolution either. We suppose that
a more satisfying classiﬁcation of these intermixed genera can
only be obtained once more genome sequences become available.
DISCUSSION
Causes of Conﬂict Between Phylogenomic
Analyses and Taxonomic Classiﬁcation
Most of the taxa of Bacteroidetes already appeared monophyletic
in this study and not in need of a taxonomic revision, which
may reﬂect recent taxonomic proposals already based on at
least multi-gene if not phylogenomic datasets (Hahnke R. L.
et al., 2016; Munoz et al., 2016; Ormerod et al., 2016). Despite
recent reclassiﬁcations at the phylum level (Horino et al., 2014;
Verbarg et al., 2014; Ben Hania et al., 2016), some species
taxonomically assigned to Bacteroidetes were still encountered in
this study that are phylogenetically placed in a distinct phylum.
The problematic classiﬁcation of Bacteroides species and other
Gram-negative anaerobic rods that were described prior to
the availability of 16S rRNA gene sequencing has been noted
early on (Olsen and Shah, 2001). With the exception of B.
pectinophilus, we here were able to propose better taxonomic
solutions for the four remaining strongly deviating Bacteroides
species, which are not the ﬁrst ones to be transferred to
Firmicutes (Gharbia et al., 2012). However, it should be noted
that according to 16S rRNA gene sequences four Flavobacterium
species, F. acidiﬁcum (Steinhaus, 1941), F. devorans (Bergey
et al., 1923), F. thermophilum (Loginova and Egorova, 1978),
and F. oceanosedimentum (Carty and Litchﬁeld, 1978) also
do not seem to belong to Bacteroidetes phylogenetically
(Supplementary Data Sheet 1) albeit taxonomically. As they
lacked a genome sequence at the time of writing, we considered
them beyond the scope of the current study. Much like the
four deviant Bacteroides species, these Flavobacterium species
are comparatively old and their taxonomic proposals were not
accompanied by phylogenetic analyses.
Within Bacteroidetes, lack of a phylogenetic analysis in
the original description also accounted for taxa misplaced
such as Cytophaga xylanolytica (Haack and Breznak, 1993)
as well as Prevotella heparinolytica and P. zoogleoformans
(Shah and Collins, 1990). However, most of the taxonomic
discrepancies observed within the phylum appeared to be
caused by low resolution of the 16S rRNA genes used
to propose the respective taxa. This held for the genera
Algibacter, Bizionia, Fabibacter, Formosa, Lacinutrix, Maribacter,
Mesoﬂavibacter, Muricauda, and Roseivirga as well as the families
or orders Cytophagaceae, Deinococcales, Flavobacteriaceae and
Marinilabiliales. Calculating branch support in an appropriate
manner is obviously a necessary, but not a suﬃcient prerequisite,
for safely generating monophyletic taxa. Additionally, taxa must
also be chosen from trees so as to correspond to highly supported
clades (Vences et al., 2013).
However, actually non-monophyletic taxa may easily appear
monophyletic when species or strains of relevance are omitted
from phylogenetic analysis. The second most important cause of
non-monophyly in Bacteroidetes detected in the current study
was incomplete taxon sampling, which aﬀected Aequorivita
vs. Vitellibacter, Bacteroides vs. Phocaeicola, Crenotalea vs.
Thermoﬂaviﬁlum, Flavobacterium vs. Myroides, Soonwooa vs.
Chryseobacterium, the recent emendation of Mariniﬁlaceae
(Ormerod et al., 2016) and the monophyly of Pedobacter,
Salinibacteraceae,
and
Williamwhitmaniaceae.
Regarding
Aequorivita vs. Vitellibacter, Crenotalea vs. Thermoﬂaviﬁlum,
and the composition of Salinibacteraceae conﬂicting taxonomic
views were published at about the same time, respectively, hence
the discrepancies were diﬃcult to avoid.
More worrying are observations of conﬂicting topologies
between 16S rRNA gene and phylogenomic analyses with
signiﬁcant support. This study identiﬁed ﬁve cases in which the
supermatrix ML topology was signiﬁcantly (α = 0.01) worse
than the best ML topology inferred from the 16S rRNA gene
in an SH test (Supplementary Table 1). Three of these cases
aﬀected taxonomic proposals made in the past, namely regarding
the monophyly of Formosa, the monophyly of Labilibacter
and Saccharicrinis, and the monophyly of Sediminibacterium.
Insuﬃcient taxon sampling and misspeciﬁed models are potential
causes for the probably incorrect 16S rRNA gene phylogenies
but we cannot rule out that in these cases the 16S rRNA gene
truly conﬂicts with the organism tree. While conﬂicts regarding
the monophyly of taxa between 16S rRNA gene and supermatrix
analyses were not detected in a previous investigation that used
exactly the same methods (Hahnke R. L. et al., 2016), the
considerably enlarged genome sampling of the present study
made it more likely to observe at least some discrepancies of this
kind. An analogous results was recently obtained for the phylum
Actinobacteria (Nouioui et al., 2018).
Compared to the overall number of taxa and the more
common causes of taxonomic conﬂicts as listed above, real
conﬂict between the 16S rRNA gene and entire genomes
(and thus between UCT and CCT) indeed appears to be
rare. As taxonomic problems caused by insuﬃcient taxon
sampling are probably much more common, we believe analyzing
comprehensive sets of 16S rRNA gene sequences to be necessary
unless all type strains are covered by genome sequences. In this
context, using a backbone constraint is a valuable means for
integrating information from analyses of more genes but fewer

Genome-Based Taxonomic Classiﬁcation of Bacteroidetes
organisms into comprehensible sampled single-gene data (Liu
X.-Z. et al., 2015; Hahnke R. L. et al., 2016; Nouioui et al.,
2018). For instance, the CCT allowed us to safely place type
species lacking genome sequences. The CCT was also helpful
to detect instances where taxonomic conclusions would have
been premature.
Whole genome-based methods such as GBDP were developed
(Henz et al., 2005; Auch et al., 2006; Meier-Kolthoﬀet al., 2014a)
for providing insights into the microbial tree of life (Patil and
McHardy, 2013; Meier-Kolthoﬀet al., 2014a,b; Liu Y. et al., 2015;
Garrido-Sanz et al., 2016; Lagkouvardos et al., 2016; Peeters et al.,
2016; Montero-Calasanz et al., 2017; Mukherjee et al., 2017;
Nouioui et al., 2018), for elucidating evolutionary relationships
of viruses and eukaryotes (Riley et al., 2016; Meier-Kolthoﬀ
and Göker, 2017) and for yielding robust branch-support values
(Hahnke R. L. et al., 2016; Nouioui et al., 2018). In general,
distance methods for tree reconstruction still represent the most
promising approach for accurately building phylogenies with a
huge number of tips (Desper and Gascuel, 2004, 2006; Lefort
et al., 2015). In the case of the GBDP/FastME approach the time-
consuming step is the calculation of the intergenomic distances
but this can be done incrementally since the pairwise distances
are calculated independently of each other.
Encouragingly, the taxonomic conclusions drawn from
the GBDP tree in the present study, too, were conﬁrmed
by corresponding supermatrix analyses in all of the cases
investigated. The main approach of this study was to assess
whether conﬂict was evident between trees inferred from
distinct data and, if so, to conduct additional analyses. This
approach appeared to be a robust procedure but the reliability
of phylogenomic results might also depend on the kind of
statistical resampling applied. Use of genome-scale data often
yields more strongly resolved trees but this may also increase
incongruities between distinct analyses (Jeﬀroy et al., 2006; Klenk
and Göker, 2010). Topological incongruities between analyses
of single genes attributed to horizontal gene transfer have
even been used to argue against the concept of hierarchical
classiﬁcation itself (Bapteste and Boucher, 2009; Klenk and
Göker, 2010). However, a strong hierarchical signal is indicated
by the observation that the addition of more genes, up to
virtually all available ones, increases support in phylogenomic
trees (Breider et al., 2014). Studies that use only a limited
number of genes rely on assumptions about the relative suitability
of the selected genes compared to other genes (Lienau and
DeSalle, 2009; Klenk and Göker, 2010) and can hardly be called
genome-scale. Whole-genome methods, such as GBDP, yield
truly genome-based phylogenies instead although overestimating
phylogenetic conﬁdence from genome-scale data must be
avoided (Taylor and Piel, 2004). A reduction of the incongruities
between trees and thereby more realistic phylogenomic support
values can be obtained by bootstrapping entire genes instead
of single alignment positions (Siddall, 2010; Hahnke R. L.
et al., 2016; Simon et al., 2017; Nouioui et al., 2018), GBDP
pseudo-bootstrapping in conjunction with the greedy-with-
trimming algorithm (Meier-Kolthoﬀet al., 2014a) is akin to
partition bootstrap.
Moreover, in this study partition bootstrapping was applied
throughout in the supermatrix analyses. The eﬀect of replacing
ordinary bootstrapping by partition bootstrapping is illustrated
by the subset of the data that was analyzed to determine
Lewinella monophyly (Supplementary Data Sheet 1). Partition
bootstrapping yielded only low support for the monophyly of
the genus, 67% (47%) from the core-gene supermatrix and
23% (76%) from the full supermatrix under ML (MP). This
is not in signiﬁcant disagreement with the GBDP tree, which
showed some support, but not particularly high support, for
a paraphyletic Lewinella. Ordinary bootstrapping resulted in
100% (73%) support for Lewinella monophyly from the core-
gene supermatrix and 100% (100%) from the full supermatrix
under ML (MP). In contrast, there were twice as many single
genes which displayed a support of ≥95% against Lewinella
monophyly than single genes with a support ≥95% for
Lewinella monophyly (Supplementary Data Sheet 1). While the
controversial phylogenetic placement of the genome sequence
of L. nigricans NBRC 102662T may be due to contamination,
its contigs did not display signiﬁcant diﬀerences regarding the
proportion of genes pointing to either monophyly or paraphyly
of Lewinella (Supplementary Table 1).
As expected (Siddall, 2010; Simon et al., 2017), the ordinary
bootstrap thus failed entirely to provide a realistic picture of
the support and counter-support from all available genomic data
for Lewinella monophyly. There are two main approaches to
interpret such a result. An assumption that is implicitly made
in all studies that only use a selection of the available genes
(often presented as “conserved” or “housekeeping” genes) to
form a supermatrix and analyse it using ordinary bootstrapping
is that conﬂicting evidence from a minority of these genes
and from the entirely neglected genes can be dismissed. We
regard this assumption as careless, particularly when no attempt
is made to actually prove that the conﬂicting evidence is
caused by evolutionary phenomena such as horizontal gene
transfer (Bapteste and Boucher, 2009) or artifacts of phylogenetic
inference such as long-branch attraction (Bergsten, 2005).
Alternatively, one can apply the partition bootstrap to a
supermatrix (Siddall, 2010; Simon et al., 2017) or use equivalent
methods such as GBDP pseudo-bootstrapping combined with
appropriate distance formulas (Meier-Kolthoﬀet al., 2014a) as
an attempt to obtain branch-support values that provide a better
indication of whether or not the majority of the genes supports a
certain clade.
In phylogenetic systematics, the purpose of taxonomic
classiﬁcation is to summarize the phylogeny of the organisms
under consideration (Wiley and Lieberman, 2011). Formally,
this is equivalent to selecting clades from a rooted phylogenetic
tree, ideally well-supported clades (Vences et al., 2013), so as
to assign taxa to these clades (in a way that avoids assigning
more than a single taxon of the same rank to the same clade
and avoids assigning a taxon of a rank higher than the one
assigned to a certain clade to a subclade of this clade). While
rampant horizontal gene transfer has been used to argue against
a microbial tree of life and thus against hierarchical classiﬁcation
(Bapteste and Boucher, 2009), our earlier review had concluded
that a strong phylogenetic signal is present despite horizontal
gene transfer (Klenk and Göker, 2010), in line with an increase
of branch support when more genes are added to a dataset
(Breider et al., 2014). Our review failed to mention, however, that

García-López et al.
Genome-Based Taxonomic Classiﬁcation of Bacteroidetes
a situation as in Lewinella, where some branches are evidently
supported by the majority of genes whereas others are not, may be
unsatisfactory from a purely phylogenetic viewpoint but actually
be advantageous for classiﬁcation because it eases the selection
of clades for assigning a taxon. In this respect, horizontal gene
transfer does not only fail to impede hierarchical classiﬁcation
but may actually be beneﬁcial for it. Similar observations were
made regarding the classiﬁcation of bacterial and archaeal viruses
(Meier-Kolthoﬀand Göker, 2017).
Genomic and Phenotypic Features as
Taxonomic Markers
As for the analysis of individual characters, the use of “diagnostic”
features in microbial taxonomy as support for taxa is a practice
that clashes with the principles of phylogenetic systematics
(Montero-Calasanz et al., 2017) which emphasize apomorphies
as evidence for the monophyly of a group (Hennig, 1965; Wiley
and Lieberman, 2011). The pitfalls of relying on “diagnostic”
character states do not originate from homoplasy, which is a
distinct problem, but from the fact that plesiomorphic (ancient)
states may well be diagnostic but for a paraphyletic group
(Nouioui et al., 2018). Reptiles may be the best known example
of a paraphyletic group, as they are perfectly diagnosed by
plesiomorphic features (Wiley and Lieberman, 2011). Among
other consequences, a single feature with two character states
cannot be used to justify the separation of two distinct taxa
because only the apomorphic character state can argue for the
monophyly of one of the two taxa (Hennig, 1965; Wiley and
Lieberman, 2011; Montero-Calasanz et al., 2017). The use of
“diagnostic” character states in microbial taxonomy without
caring about whether or not these states are apomorphic may
either be regarded as an oversimpliﬁcation or as historically
originating from the phenetic school of taxonomic classiﬁcation
rather than the phylogenetic one (Klenk and Göker, 2010).
In fact, the term “polyphasic taxonomy,” which stands for the
integration of genetic and phenotypic data (Vandamme et al.,
1996; Gillis et al., 2005; Kämpfer and Glaeser, 2012), was
originally introduced in conjunction with phenetic methodology
(Colwell, 1970).
Current microbial taxonomy remains inconsistent regarding
its principles as long as phylogenetic methods such as maximum
likelihood, maximum parsimony, or neighbor joining, as
opposed to clustering techniques (Felsenstein, 2004), are applied
to sequence data whereas phenetic reasoning (Sneath and Sokal,
1963) is applied to phenotypic data. For these reasons, there are
two distinct kinds of causes for the discrepancies between the
phylogenomic trees and the traditional classiﬁcation, which was
at least partially based on phenotypic characters. The characters
themselves may be in conﬂict with the phylogenomic trees,
and the taxonomic interpretation of these characters may be
insuﬃcient (Montero-Calasanz et al., 2017; Nouioui et al., 2018).
In order to distinguish between these two options, it is of course
necessary to examine the characters as they were used in the
taxonomic literature. For such a historical assessment it makes no
sense to analyse new, modiﬁed characters derived from the earlier
ones by, e.g., taking their genetic background into account, as this
genetic background was not used for establishing the traditional
classiﬁcation in the ﬁrst place.
In fact, we did not ﬁnd any of the terms “apomorphic,”
“apomorphy,” “plesiomorphic,” and “plesiomorphy” in any of the
1,744 screened literature references on Bacteroidetes taxonomy
within the database of the DSMZ Prokaryotic Nomenclature
Up-To-Date service. However, given a tree topology and the
distribution of the states of a character that does not display too
much homoplasy, it is not diﬃcult to determine which states
are apomorphic and which are plesiomorphic. For instance,
it is encouraging that the number of isoprene residues of the
major menaquinones showed such high agreement with the
phylogenomic tree (Table 1). While the considerable uniformity
of the classes of Bacteroidetes regarding menaquinones comes as
no surprise and is partially already reﬂected in their protologs,
in other cases it appears necessary to accordingly emend
their descriptions as proposed below. The example also nicely
illustrates that there is always at least one character state, even
in a key character, that must not be used to justify a group:
if possessing MK-7 as major menaquinone is plesiomorphic as
indicated in Table 2 and the GBDP tree, the set of strains that can
be diagnosed by MK-7 do not need to form a monophylum. Had
phenetic principles be applied to interpret this key character, the
MK-7 taxa may have been grouped into a single class.
Likewise, it is reasonable to postulate that the ancestor of
Bacteroidetes was aerobic and that, accordingly, an anaerobic
life style is an apomorphy of speciﬁc subgroups of the phylum.
Indeed, the oxygen condition also displayed a strong ﬁt to the
phylogenomic tree. A previous study using a 16S rRNA gene
tree but phenotypic features collected from recent taxonomic
descriptions published in the International Journal of Systematic
and Evolutionary Microbiology across phyla (Barberán et al.,
2017) observed that cell shape had a stronger phylogenetic
signal than physiological features such as temperature and
pH optimum and even relationship to oxygen. In the present
study, using a genome-scale tree of Bacteroidetes, relationship
to oxygen showed a considerably stronger phylogenetic signal
than cell width and cell length (Table 1). Within Bacteroidetes, as
exempliﬁed by the class Bacteroidia and by Capnocytophaga, the
switch from strictly aerobic to strictly anaerobic was apparently
mediated by facultatively aerobic or facultatively anaerobic
life styles (Supplementary Data Sheet 1). It should be noted,
however, that the full range of physiological capabilities regarding
oxygen may not be obvious from the original description of
a species. For instance, Flavobacterium resistens was originally
described as aerobic but later recognized as facultatively
anaerobic (Kim et al., 2012).
Incomplete information from the taxonomic literature may
also aﬀect menaquinones as usually only the major menaquinone
is reported instead of the full spectrum, including percentage
occurrences of individual compounds (The same restriction
applies to fatty acids but the analysis of their phylogenetic
conservation in Bacteroidetes is beyond the scope of the present
study). Menaquinones were reported as absent in Bacteroides
luti (Hatamoto et al., 2014). If this is not an artifact, it further
illustrates the diﬃculty to deﬁne taxa in terms of even seemingly
conserved characters.

García-López et al.
Genome-Based Taxonomic Classiﬁcation of Bacteroidetes
The relatively low ﬁt of the occurrence of gliding motility
and ﬂexirubins to the tree (Table 1) is more diﬃcult to explain.
Biosynthesis of ﬂexirubin-type pigments (Reichenbach et al.,
1974, 1980) is encoded in a single large gene cluster in
Flavobacterium johnsoniae UW101 and two distinct gene clusters
in Chitinophaga pinensis DSM 2588 (McBride et al., 2009;
Schöner et al., 2014). Similarly, gliding motility is based on the
interplay of a variety of largely known genes and their products
(McBride and Zhu, 2013; Nan et al., 2014; Nan, 2017). Both
characters can thus be assumed to be rather complex. According
to Dollo’s law, complex features arise only once in evolution
but may be lost several times (Farris, 1977), hence a group of
organisms displaying a complex feature should be monophyletic
or paraphyletic in a tree, but not polyphyletic (Nouioui et al.,
2018). Thus, Dollo’s law alone could account for homoplasy
in a complex character. However, ancestral character-state
reconstructions under maximum parsimony with TNT and the
same settings as used in Table 1 did not indicate a considerably
higher number of losses than gains in the case of gliding and
ﬂexirubins unless gains are weighted at least eight times more
heavily than losses (Supplementary Data Sheet 1). Similarly,
a Dollo scenario had been postulated regarding anoxygenic
photosynthesis in Rhodobacteraceae, which was presumed to
be originally present and lost several times, but recent data
indicate that entire photosynthesis operons had been horizontally
transferred several times during the evolution of the family
(Brinkmann et al., 2018). Such vertical transfer of complex
characters may also be possible in Bacteroidetes.
While
examining
the
genomic
constitution
regarding
biosynthesis of ﬂexirubin-like pigments or gliding motility is
beyond the scope of the present study, a potential alternative
explanation is that many strains do not glide under the usual
cultivation conditions even though they have the genomic
potential to do so. Moreover, reports on presence or absence of
ﬂexirubins could lack accuracy because the frequently performed
KOH test is easy to apply but lacks speciﬁcity and sensitivity in
some cases (Bernardet et al., 2002). A variety of eﬀects may thus
contribute to the relatively low phylogenetic conservation of the
distribution of gliding motility and ﬂexirubins, which in turn
may help explaining the observed discrepancies between the
current taxonomic classiﬁcation and the phylogenomic results.
Bacterial

and

appeared
to
be

conserved
in
Bacteroidetes
(Supplementary Data Sheet 1,
Tables 1, 2). It is for these reasons that the descriptions of the
classes of Bacteroidetes are proposed to be emended regarding
menaquinones and that genome sizes have been added to the
description of the reclassiﬁed and emended species as shown
below. The signiﬁcant correlation between genome size and
G+C content that was found in previous studies (Almpanis
et al., 2018; Nouioui et al., 2018) is not unexpected because
symbiotic bacteria tend to have smaller genomes and to be
richer in A+T content (Rocha and Danchin, 2002; Mann and
Chen, 2010), whereas positive selection (Hildebrand et al., 2010)
and G+C-biased gene conversion (Lassalle et al., 2015) can
increase the G+C content. Although exceptions from the rule
that reduced genomes have a low G+C content are known
(McCutcheon et al., 2009), genome size could thus be regarded as
non-independent of G+C content, which would cast some doubt
on it use as a taxonomic marker. Yet the overall correlation
was considerably reduced in strength after accounting for the
impact of the phylogeny (Nouioui et al., 2018) and may in fact
be restricted to G+C reduction eﬀects in symbiotic bacteria with
dramatically reduced genome sizes. Such groups appear to be
lacking in Bacteroidetes (Supplementary Data Sheet 1). As in
Actinobacteria, both G+C content and genome size thus appear
to be of use as taxonomic markers in Bacteroidetes.
As in the case of our earlier studies (Hahnke R. L. et al.,
2016; Nouioui et al., 2018), many species descriptions were found
to be inaccurate or too imprecise now that it has been shown
that within-species deviation in G+C content is at most 1%
(Meier-Kolthoﬀet al., 2014c). It is good practice to strengthen
species descriptions in this way because such values not only
assist in detecting strains that do not belong to the same species
but also show signiﬁcant correlation to phylogenetic trees. In
contrast, in most cases it is premature to redeﬁne genera and
higher taxa of Bacteroidetes in this way since additional type-
strain genome sequences would be needed before this issue
could be addressed. However, some genera were comprehensively
sampled genomically in this study, which allows for providing
respective emendations below.
CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK
The results of this comparative phylogenomic study provide a
further improved framework for the classiﬁcation of the phylum
Bacteroidetes. The improved taxonomic classiﬁcation provides
a sound basis for future studies on these bacteria, not least
on those of clinical, piscicultural, and ecological interest. While
it may be regarded as a truism that genome-based taxonomy
must be based on genomic data, it should not be overlooked
that this actually rules out the application of arbitrary and
non-representative gene selections, and this study reiterates
the pitfalls inherent in combining such gene selections with
ordinary bootstrapping to obtain branch support. Similarly,
discrepancies with aspects of the taxonomic classiﬁcation based
on the 16S rRNA gene were apparently mainly caused by
overestimated or disregarded branch support, even though some
exceptions appear to exist in which the 16S rRNA gene is in
real conﬂict with genome-scale phylogenies. While not as tightly
bound to the phylogeny as the G+C content, the relatively
high correspondence between genome size and phylogenomic
trees analyses yields “grist to the taxonomic mill.” Even
more encouraging is the strong agreement between prominent
phenotypic characters of Bacteroidetes and truly genome-scale
phylogenies, provided these characters are interpreted in terms
of the principles of phylogenetic systematics, which have so
successfully been applied outside of microbial taxonomy. Future
phylogenomic studies should try to link such key phenotypic
features, their genomic basis and their evolutionary relationships,
and make an attempt to clarify the evolutionary relationships
between the richly sampled groups that could as yet not
be resolved. Success in Bacteroidetes may help to revitalize
prokaryotic systematics as a fundamental scientiﬁc discipline in
other parts of the bacterial tree of life.
