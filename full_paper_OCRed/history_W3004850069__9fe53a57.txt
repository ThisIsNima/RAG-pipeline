Abstract
Biochar is a pyrogenous, organic material
synthesized through pyrolysis of different biomass
(plant or animal waste). The potential biochar appli-
cations include: (1) pollution remediation due to high
CEC and speciﬁc surface area; (2) soil fertility
improvement on the way of liming effect, enrichment
in volatile matter and increase of pore volume, (3)
carbon sequestration due to carbon and ash content,
etc. Biochar properties are affected by several tech-
nological parameters, mainly pyrolysis temperature
and feedstock kind, which differentiation can lead to
products with a wide range of values of pH, speciﬁc
surface area, pore volume, CEC, volatile matter, ash
and carbon content. High pyrolysis temperature pro-
motes the production of biochar with a strongly
developed speciﬁc surface area, high porosity, pH as
well as content of ash and carbon, but with low values
of CEC and content of volatile matter. This is most
likely due to signiﬁcant degree of organic matter
decomposition. Biochars produced from animal litter
and solid waste feedstocks exhibit lower surface areas,
carbon content, volatile matter and high CEC com-
pared to biochars produced from crop residue and
wood biomass, even at higher pyrolysis temperatures.
The reason for this difference is considerable variation
in lignin and cellulose content as well as in moisture
content of biomass. The physicochemical properties of
biochar determine application of this biomaterial as an
additive to improve soil quality. This review suc-
cinctly presents the impact of pyrolysis temperature
and the type of biomass on the physicochemical
characteristics of biochar and its impact on soil
fertility.

1 Introduction
Biochar is a carbon-rich material. It can be used not
only as a renewable fuel, but also as an additive for
improvement of soil quality (Lehmann and Joseph
2009). The nature of carbon structures is the key
reason for the high stability (Lehmann et al. 2011;
Nguyen et al. 2010). The most pronounced chemical
difference between biochar and other organic matter is
much higher proportion of aromatic C and condensed
aromatic structures, in contrast to other aromatic
structures of soil organic matter, such as lignin
(Schmidt and Noack 2000). The condensed aromatic
structure of biochars can have varying forms, includ-
ing amorphous C (which dominates at lower pyrolysis
temperatures), turbostratic C (formed at higher tem-
peratures) and graphite C (Keiluweit et al. 2010;

Nguyen et al. 2010). Biochar exhibits high biodegrad-
ability, high contents of total and organic carbon, as
well
as
optimal
concentrations
of
micro-
and
macroelements (potassium, sodium, magnesium, cal-
cium, copper, zinc, iron etc.) (Malin´ska 2012). It is
generally characterized by a high speciﬁc surface area,
high content of surface functional groups, pH and
porosity (Hernandez-Mena et al. 2014; Lehmann et al.
2011). Hernandez-Mena et al. (2014) showed that
biochar exhibits high porosity, with longitudinal pores
of sizes ranging from micro- to macropores. Large
pores, originating from the vascular bundles of the raw
biomass, are important for improving soil quality
because they can provide habitats for symbiotic
microorganisms (Thies and Rillig 2009). Porous
structures can also act as release routes for pyrolytic
vapours (Lee et al. 2013a).
Biochar is created through the pyrolysis of biomass.
Pyrolysis represents the oldest known method of
biomass thermal processing. The use of pyrolysis
dates back at least to ancient Egypt (Mohan et al.
2006). Biowastes from agriculture, the food industry,
and forestry are the main sources of feedstock (Shakya
and Agarwal 2017). The most popular substrates
include wood chips and pellets, tree cuttings, bagasse,
distiller grains, press cakes from the oil and juice
industry, rice husks and crop residues (Parmar et al.
2014). However, production can also be based on
biomass sources other than lignocelluloses matter,
such as sewage sludge, poultry litter, excrement,
bones, dairy manure etc. (Kumar et al. 2016). The
selection of suitable conditions for producing a char
with the desired properties therefore requires knowl-
edge of dependencies and inﬂuencing factors, both
quantitatively and qualitatively (Weber and Quicker
2018; Zhang et al. 2019). The products of pyrolysis are
an oil (a mixture of hydrocarbons), synthetic gas
(mixed
hydrocarbon
gases)
and
biochar
(Le-
wandowski et al. 2010; Verheijen et al. 2010). The
proportions of these individual products depend on the
temperature range, pressure, residence time, etc.
(Brewer 2012; Cheah et al. 2016; Lewandowski
et al. 2010). It is summarized in Table 1. The slow
pyrolysis is the most effective for biochar production
with a typical biochar yield of 35.0% from dry
biomass weight. The fast pyrolysis is the most efﬁcient
method for producing biofuels and the gasiﬁcation is
the most efﬁcient for producing syngas and hence is
usually used to generate heat and energy (Cheah et al.
2016). As a result of high heating rates and short
residence times, fast pyrolysis tends to yield higher
proportions of oils. In contrast, slow pyrolysis tends to
yield higher proportions of biochars because of slow
heating rates and longer residence times (Daful and
Chandraratne 2018). Furthermore, the pyrolysis of
biomass may contribute to the formation of phytotoxic
and potentially carcinogenic compounds under some
conditions (type of feedstock, pollution in feedstock,
and pyrolysis parameters) (Ndriangu et al. 2019).
Some of the heavy metals are transformed into less
toxic forms, pathogens are eliminated as the result of
the pyrolysis process (Paz-Ferreiro et al. 2018), but
nitrogen
and
sulphur
are
lost
during
pyrolysis
(Maguire and Agblevor 2010). Therefore, biochar
has been researched as a soil modiﬁer.
Biochar has a long history as a soil modiﬁer
(Brewer 2012). Early Japanese farmers used unique
manure called ‘‘haigoe’’, which was prepared by
adding human waste to rice husk biochar and applying
it to ﬁelds some time before planting crops (Shakya
and Agarwal 2017). Moreover, the addition of biochar
may affect the biological community composition of
soil, as demonstrated for the ‘Terra Preta’ soils in the
Amazon (Lehmann et al. 2011). Soil is a complex
material and comprises minerals, soil organic matter,
water, and air. These fractions greatly inﬂuence soil
texture, structure, and porosity (Baghdadi and Zribi
2016). These properties subsequently affect air and
water movement in the soil layers and thus the soil’s
ability to function (Naga Raju et al. 2017). Therefore,
soil physicochemical properties have a great inﬂuence
on the soil quality. Biochar generally increases carbon
sequestration in soil (Sohi et al. 2010), reduces the
emission of ammonia and carbon dioxide (Cabeza
et al. 2018), lowers soil compactness, optimizes
compost (Liang et al. 2010), improves water retention
and the sorption of heavy metals, increases the
availability of micronutrients for plants and increases
the pH of soils (Van Zwieten et al. 2010). Biochar also
stimulates the growth of rhizosphere microorganisms
and mycorrhizal fungi (Głuszek et al. 2017). These
bacteria and fungi may also promote plant growth
(Compant et al. 2010).
The authors provided a more comprehensive and
insightful scientiﬁc overview. The objective of this
review presented herein is to assess: (1) the physic-
ochemical characteristics of biochar formed at differ-
ent temperatures and from different biomass, (2) the

mechanisms of change in biochar structure, surface
and main physicochemical properties, (3) discussion
of biochars effect on the physicochemical properties
of the soil and biological properties of the soil and (4)
the application and potential effects of biochar as a soil
adsorbent. The explanation of the main mechanisms of
changes in physicochemical properties of biochar
during pyrolysis at various temperatures and the types
of feedstock is necessary to determine the ability of
biochar to remediate various soils, which is useful in
future studies.
2 Effects of pyrolysis temperature
Process of biochar production had three stages: pre-
pyrolysis; main-pyrolysis and formation of carbona-
ceous soil products (Lee et al. 2017). The ﬁrst stage
(from ambient temperature to 200 C) is attributed to
evaporation of moisture and light volatiles. The
moisture evaporation causes breakage of bonds and
formation hydroperoxide, –COOH and –CO groups
(Ca´rdenas-Aguiar et al. 2017). The second stage (from
200 to 500 C) was a devolatilized and decomposed of
hemicelluloses and cellulose at a fast rate (Ding et al.
2014). The last stage (above 500 C) is degradation of
lignin and other organic matter with stronger chemical
bonds (Ca´rdenas-Aguiar et al. 2017). The pyrolysis
temperature is strongly correlated with changes in the
structure and physicochemical properties of biochar
(Asadullah et al. 2007; Chen et al. 2008; Jindo et al.
2014; Mukherjee et al. 2011). Data on these relation-
ships are presented in Table 2. Pyrolysis temperature
had a strong inﬂuence on biochars physicochemical
properties (e.g. surface area, pH and functional
groups) and it affected on the functions of biochar as
a soil amendment (Ding et al. 2014). Higher pyrolysis
temperature resulted in an increase of surface area,
carbonized fractions, pH and volatile matter and a
decrease of CEC and content of surface functional
groups.
2.1 Speciﬁc surface area
It has been found that increasing pyrolysis temperature
causes changes in biochar surface area and porosity
(Bonelli et al. 2007). This is most likely due to the
decomposition of organic matter and the formation of
micropores (Katyal et al. 2003). Moreover, the
destruction of aliphatic alkyls and ester groups as
well as the exposure of the aromatic lignin core under
higher pyrolysis temperatures may result in increased
surface area (Chen and Chen 2009). Ghani et al.
(2013) have shown that at lower temperatures (less
than 500 C), lignin is not converted into a hydropho-
bic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and
biochar becomes more hydrophilic. At temperatures
higher than 650 C, biochar is thermally stable and
becomes more hydrophobic (Ghani et al. 2013).
However, the hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity of the
surface is not an unambiguous factor conditioning the
sorption process of aromatic compounds. The surface
area of the biochar increases with increasing temper-
ature. This is because with increasing pyrolysis
temperature, pore-blocking substances are driven off
or are thermally cracked, increasing the externally
accessible surface area (Raﬁq et al. 2016). Pyrolysis
may increase the surface area and pore volumes
through progressive degradation of the organic mate-
rials (cellulose, lignin) and the formation of vascular

bundles or channel structure (Li et al. 2013; Zhao et al.
2017). Some amorphous carbon structures also form
during pyrolysis due to the degradation of cellulose
(Zhao et al. 2017).It has been reported that micropores
may be formed by amorphous carbon structures
(Vamvuka and Sfakiotakis 2011). A higher pyrolysis
temperature causes the release of volatile matter and
creates more pores (Shaaban et al. 2014). Low speciﬁc
surface areas with low ash content were observed in
biochars produced from cotton seed hull (4.7 m2/g)
(Uchimiya et al. 2011b), poultry litter (17.7 m2/
g) (Novak et al. 2009) and dairy manures (13.0 m2/
g) (Cao and Harris 2010). The type and concentration
of surface functional groups have been reported to
play an important role in adsorption capacity and the
removal mechanism of the adsorbates (Yenisoy-
Karakas¸ et al. 2004). Moreover, an increase in the
structure aromaticity with an increase in pyrolysis
temperature can also enhance resistance to microbial
decomposition (Xie et al. 2015). Uchimiya et al.
(2010) discovered that biochar produced at a temper-
ature higher than 400 C was more effective for
organic and inorganic contaminant sorption due to its
high surface area and considerable micropore devel-
opment. However, Chen et al. (2008) proved that the
partitioning of organic and inorganic contaminants
into non-carbonized biochar fractions derived from
pine needles was the major sorption mechanism at low
pyrolysis
temperatures
(100–300 C),
whereas
adsorption onto porous carbonized fractions was
dominant at high temperatures (400–700 C).
2.2 Surface Functional Groups and CEC
The heating to temperatures of 350–650 C breaks and
rearranges the chemical bonds in the biomass, forming
new functional groups (e.g. carboxyl, lactone, lactol,
quinine, chromene, anhydride, phenol, ether, pyrone,
pyridine, pyridone, and pyrrole) (Mia et al. 2017).
Figures 1 and 2 shows example structures on the outer
surface of the graphene sheets (Harris 1997; Harris
and Tsang 1997) and pores (Van Zwieten et al. 2010;
Zheng et al. 2010). The FTIR spectra indicate that
biochar is dominated by functional groups typical of
oxygenated hydrocarbons, reﬂecting the carbohydrate
structure of cellulose and hemicelluloses (Ghani et al.
2013). The pyrolysis process can cause the disappear-
ance of absorption bands characteristic of raw material
and the appearance of new bands typical of biochar
samples. Ghani et al. (2013) demonstrated that the
biochar from sawdust exhibited a broad band between
3000 and 3600 cm-1 (peak maximum at 3339 cm-1),

with a smaller band from 2700 to 3000 cm-1 (max-
imum at 2907 cm-1). The band centred at 3339 cm-1
was attributed to the presence of OH functional groups
(alcoholic and phenolic) (Pretsch et al. 2009), while
the band at * 2907 cm-1 was attributed to alkyl C–H
stretching (Claoston et al., 2014). The band occurring
at 1600 cm-1 was attributed to aromatic C–C and C–O
stretching of conjugated ketones and quinones (Ruthi-
raan et al. 2015), and the band occurring at 1735 cm-1
was attributed to C=O stretching of ketones, aldehydes
and esters (Uchimiya et al. 2011a). The band centred at
1238 cm-1 was attributed to the presence of C–O–C
groups and aryl ethers, phenolic associated with lignin
(Kardam et al. 2012). The intense band occurring at
1130 cm-1 was characteristic of C–O–C stretching of
ester groups in cellulose and hemicelluloses (Jeba
Jeevitha et al. 2015). All of these bands are typical for
the FTIR of biochars (Claoston et al. 2014; Ghani et al.
2013; Liu et al. 2015; Kardam et al. 2012; Zhao et al.
2017).
The effect of temperature on biochar structure and
functional groups is shown in Fig. 3. Biochar pro-
duced at high temperatures (600–700 C) exhibits a
highly hydrophobic nature with well-organized C
layers (Uchimiya et al. 2011a). However, it is
characterized by lower contents of H- and O-contain-
ing functional groups due to dehydration and deoxy-
genation of the biomass (Ahmad et al. 2014a;
Uchimiya et al. 2011a). Surface groups can act as
electron donors or electron acceptors, which leads to
the formation of coexisting areas whose properties can
range from acidic to basic and from hydrophilic to
hydrophobic (Amonette and Joseph 2009). Conse-
quently, such a product exhibits potentially lower ion
exchange capacity (Novak et al. 2009). On the other
hand,
biochar
produced
at
lower
temperatures
(300–400 C) displays more diversiﬁed organic char-
acter due to the occurrence of aliphatic and cellulose
type structures (Glaser et al. 2002; Novak et al. 2009).
As a result, the structure of biochar appears to have
more organized C layers (like graphene structure) and
less content of surface functional groups when pyrol-
ysis temperature increases (Ahmad et al. 2014b).
The decrease in CEC is due to the removal of
surface functional groups and the formation of
aromatic carbon (Joseph et al. 2010). Numerous
studies have reported that the cation exchange capac-
ity (CEC) of biochar decreases with increasing
pyrolysis temperature (Mukherjee et al. 2011; Song
and Guo 2012; Yao et al. 2012). The detectable CEC
suggested that when biochar was produced at temper-
atures up to 480 C, some acidic oxygenated func-
tional groups such as phenolic acid and carboxyl
groups were retained (Mitchell et al. 2013). Banik
et al. (2018) reported that the CEC of biochar is
dependent on the nature and distribution of O-con-
taining functional groups on the biochar surface. The
negative charge sites on biochar surfaces are attributed

to carboxylate and phenolate functional groups (Mia
et al. 2017). They assume that negative surface charge
can only come from carboxylate and phenolate groups
and positive charge from oxonium groups (heteroa-
toms in aromatic rings) (Banik et al. 2018). However,
other studies have found that biochars with higher
speciﬁc surface area (obtained at temperatures above
600 C) have greater surface microporosity and
increased CEC (Gomez-Eyles et al. 2013; Kasozi
et al. 2010). This was caused by the loss of volatile
matter (Cely et al. 2015; Song and Guo 2012).
2.3 Volatile matter
Pyrolysis temperature has an inﬂuence on the structure
of biochar due to the release of volatiles and the
formation and volatilization of intermediate melts
(Shaaban et al. 2014). Increasing the temperature leads
to a decreased content of volatile matter (VM)
(Crombie et al. 2013; Tag et al. 2016). Zhao et al.
(2017) reported that an increase in the pyrolysis
temperature
decreased
the
content
of
VM
(by
60.8–14.9%) for biochars obtained from apple tree
branches. This was observed because the increasing
temperature resulted in further cracking of the volatile
fractions into low-molecular-weight liquids and gases
instead of biochar (Ronsse et al. 2012). Furthermore,
increasing temperature might result in the dehydration
of hydroxyl groups and thermal degradation of
cellulose and lignin (Zhang et al. 2015). Low-
temperature
biochars
contain
labile
hydroxyl,
carbonyl, carboxyl and hemiacetal compounds, while
high-temperature biochars contain pyranones, ethers
and quinines (Bourke et al. 2007). Antal and Grønli
(2003) reported the stepwise chemical changes of
cellulose subjected to increasing temperature. Bio-
chars were dominated by oligosaccharides during the
ﬁrst stage of the pyrolysis process (temperatures up to
250 C). Phenols and furans appeared in biochars as
the temperature increased to 290 C. At temperatures
above 290 C, the biochar consisted primarily of alkyl
furans, benzenoid aromatics, and condensed aromat-
ics. The volatile matter content of a biochar affects the
stability of the material (Zimmerman 2010), its N
availability (Deenik et al. 2010), plant growth (Deenik
et al. 2010; Denyes et al. 2014) and its sorption
capacity (Mukherjee et al. 2011). The volatile com-
ponents ﬁll micropores, dominating the surface of
biochars, and are released from pores at higher
production temperatures, making them accessible to
ions (Mukherjee et al. 2011). The content of volatile
matter can affect plant growth in two ways: toxic
compounds such as phenol can inhibit root growth,
while oligosaccharides, which are produced during the
ﬁrst two stages, can serve as a labile carbon for
microbial decomposition (Fernandes and Brooks
2003).
2.4 Carbon content and ash content
The carbon and ash contents of biochar increase with
increasing pyrolysis temperature (Chen et al. 2008;
Fig. 3 Pyrolysis temperature effect on biochar: a amorphous carbon; b turbostratic carbon; c graphite carbon
123
198
Rev Environ Sci Biotechnol (2020) 19:191–215

----- Page 9 (native) -----
Fuertes et al. 2010). High carbon content suggests that
biochars probably still contain a certain amount of
original organic plant residues such as cellulose (Chun
et al. 2004). Raﬁq et al. (2016) reported that increased
pyrolysis
temperature
caused
an
increase
of
5.7–18.7% in ash content. The increase in the ash
content resulted from progressive concentration of
inorganic constituents and OM combustion residues
(Cao and Harris 2010; Chen et al. 2014; Zhao et al.
2017). Also, Zama et al. (2017) explained the
increases in Mg, Ca, K, and P on biochars pyrolysed
at high temperatures as being due to increased ash
content (ranging from 4.0 to 33.1%). Mineral matter
forming ash remains in biochar following carboniza-
tion (Domingues et al. 2017; O¨ zc¸imen and Ersoy-
Meric¸boyu 2010). Increased carbon content (ranging
from 62.2 to 92.4%) with an increase in pyrolysis
temperature occurs due to a higher degree of poly-
merization (Domingues et al. 2017), leading to a more
condensed carbon structure in the biochar (Lehmann
and Joseph, 2009). For example, the carbon content of
orange pomace biochar increased with increasing
pyrolysis temperature (ranging from 56.8 to 68.1%)
(Tag et al. 2016). Cantrell et al. (2012) observed that
the carbon content of poultry litter biochar decreased
with increasing pyrolysis temperature (ranging from
27.0 to 35.5%). The greater the degree of formation of
aromatic structures, the higher the resistance of the
biochar to microbial degradation (Keiluweit et al.
2010). Biochars with high ash contents also tend to
have greater amounts of PAHs and trace metals
(Yargicoglu et al. 2015). Preliminary studies have
indicated that rigorous control of the feedstock
materials and pyrolysis conditions contributed to
substantial reductions of the emission levels of
atmospheric pollutants (e.g. PAHs, dioxins) and
particulate matter associated with biochar production
(Verheijen et al. 2010).
2.5 pH
The pH values of biochars are positively correlated
with the formation of carbonates and the contents of
inorganic alkalis (Ding et al. 2014). These groups are
the main cause of alkaline pH (Yuan et al. 2011). The
contents of total base cations and carbonates have been
reported to increase with increasing temperature,
contributing to increased pH (ranging from 6.5 to
10.8) (Yuan et al. 2011). Higher pH with increasing
temperature has been associated with the increases in
ash content and oxygen functional groups that occur
during pyrolysis (Ronsse et al. 2012; Spokas et al.
2012; Zhao et al. 2017). The disappearance of acidic
functional groups (–COOH) and appearance of basic
functional groups are additional contributors (Al-
Wabel et al. 2013). However, increases in pH occur
primarily due to the separation of alkali salts from
organic materials due to increased pyrolysis temper-
ature (Ding et al. 2014; Yuan et al. 2011). Above
300 C, alkali salts begin to separate from the organic
matrix, increasing the pH of the product. In contrast,
cellulose
and
hemicelluloses
decompose
around
200–300 C, yielding organic acids and phenolic
substances that lower the pH of the products (Yu
et al. 2014). The pH becomes constant at a temperature
around 600 C when all of the alkali salts are released
from the pyrolytic structure (Shinogi and Kanri 2003).
3 Effects of feedstock material
Biomass is a complex biological, organic or non-
organic solid material derived from living or recently
living organisms (Mohan et al. 2006). Various types of
wastes, such as animal manure, waste paper, sludge
and many industrial wastes, are also treated as biomass
because, like natural biomass, these waste materials
are also a mixture of organic and non-organic com-
pounds and can be processed to obtain energy
(Tripathi et al. 2016). Biomass is categorized into
woody and non-woody biomass. Woody biomass
primarily comprises residues from forestry and trees
(Jafri et al. 2018). The characteristics of woody
biomass are low moisture, low ash, high caloriﬁc
value, high bulk density and less voidage (Jafri et al.
2018). Non-woody biomass consists of agricultural
crops and residues, animal waste, urban and industrial
solid waste (Jafri et al. 2018). It is considered to have
high moisture and high ash content, lower caloriﬁc
value, low bulk density and higher voidage (Jafri et al.
2018).
The moisture content has inﬂuence on biochar
formation (Kloss et al. 2012; Sun et al. 2014).
Moisture contained in biomass not only increases the
energy required to reach the pyrolysis temperature, it
also inhibits char formation (Tripathi et al. 2016)
Biomass is always associated with some amount of
water/moisture content. This water inside a biomass
123

199

----- Page 10 (native) -----
can exist as water vapour, chemically bound water
(adsorbed within the pores of biomass) and free liquid
water (Vassilev et al. 2013). Low moisture is advisable
for the biochar production due to considerable reduc-
tion the heat energy and time required for the pyrolysis
making the process economically viable as compared
to pyrolysis involving biomass with high moisture
content (Tripathi et al. 2016). Wide range of moisture
content in biomass promotes production biochars with
different physicochemical characteristics (Tripathi
et al. 2016). For example, the moisture content of
hardwood and softwood bark samples had a pro-
nounced effect on the surface chemistry of the
pyrolytic charcoals (Darmstadt et al. 2000). With
decreasing maple bark moisture the charcoal surface
becomes more polyaromatic and graphite-like, prob-
ably due to the longer effective pyrolysis time after the
water has been evaporated (Darmstadt et al. 2000).
3.1 Volatile matter, carbon content and ash
content
The lignin and cellulose content have inﬂuence on
biochar formation (Kloss et al. 2012). Cellulose,
present in the biomass, helps in the formation of tar
(is a mixture of discrete ketones, aldehydes, organic
liquids, and char), while high lignin content is
favourable for char production during pyrolysis (Tri-
pathi et al. 2016; Yu et al. 2014). El-Gamal et al.
(2017) reported that the content of cellulose and
hemicelluloses as well as moisture content of sugar-
cane bagasse were higher than rice husk, but rice husk
biomass had higher content of lignin and ash. These
can be attributed to the presence of different organic
constituents in feedstock (El-Gamal et al. 2017).
Lignin is amorphous and hydrophobic polymer with
high molecular weight and numerous functional
groups of aromatic substructure (Lee et al. 2013b).
Cellulose and hemicelluloses are consisting of simple
sugar monomer, which decompose at a temperature
lower than 450 C (Lee et al. 2013b). These two
compounds have lower molecular weight than lignin
and are easily released as pyrolytic vapors (Lee et al.
2013a), while lignin is very resistant to thermal
degradation. Shariff et al. (2016) shows that coconut
frond feedstock had higher cellulose (39.1%) and
hemicelluloses (22.5%) content than coconut husk-
biochar (33.6 and 22.0%). Coconut husk-feedstock
had also higher lignin content (28.2%) than coconut
frond feedstock (21.5%). Shariff et al. (2016) observed
that the variations of lignocellulosic component in the
feedstock inﬂuence biochar production. The high
lignin composition in the feedstock will result in
higher char formation (Demirbas 2004). This indi-
cated that production of biochar will be increased with
increased lignin content in feedstock (Shariff et al.
2016).
The higher lignin content in plant biomass has been
reported to promote carbonization and to increase
biochar carbon content and ash content (Sohi et al.
2010; Wang et al. 2015). Other studies of biomass
structure have revealed that cellulose and hemicellu-
loses also have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the carbon
and ash contents (Rauber et al. 2018; Tripathi et al.
2016). Keiluweit et al. (2010) investigated different
biochars derived from grass and wood biomass.
Woody biomass often has higher cellulose, hemicel-
lulose and lignin contents (Fig. 4) than biomass from
herbaceous or grass species (Keiluweit et al. 2010;
Lupoi and Smith 2012). However, apart from the
lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose, a high yield of
pyrolysis is also related to a high content of inorganic
constituents of the feedstock materials, as indicated by
their relatively high ash content and low content of
volatile matter (Keiluweit et al. 2010). For example
wood derived biochars have lower ash content
(\ 7.0%) in comparison to non-wood-derived bio-
chars ([ 50.0%) (Mukome et al. 2013). Singh and
Cowie (2010) observed lower ash content in eucalyp-
tus-derived biochar compared to poultry litter and cow
manure. Manure and grass biochars typically have
higher ash contents due to the presence of silica from
soil contamination (Mukome et al. 2013). The low ash
content makes biochar more amenable to transporta-
tion and incorporation into soils, as there is less wind-
blown loss (Mukome et al. 2013). Additionally, Zhang
et al. (2019) shows that the ash content was the lowest
in woody biochars (1.5–3.0%) and the highest in
peanut shell biochars (7.0–12.0%). Selection of wood-
biochars would limit the increase in soil ash content,
which has been associated with increased hydropho-
bicity (Kookana et al. 2011). An increase in hydropho-
bicity causes potential retention of hydrophobic
agrochemicals, such as the herbicides (Sopen˜a et al.
2012). Zielin´ska et al. (2015) shows that sewage
sludge derived–biochars were characterized by high
ash content (ranged from 64.1 to 79.1%). This results
123

----- Page 11 (native) -----
from complexity and diversity of components con-
tained in biomass (Zielin´ska et al. 2015).
Different biochars clearly demonstrate that plant-
based biomass undergoes dehydration and depoly-
merization into smaller dissociation products of lignin
and cellulose with an increase in pyrolysis temperature
(Keiluweit et al. 2010). However, biochars derived
from poultry manure and sewage sludge do not
undergo depolymerisation due to the absence of
lignocellulosic compounds (Liu et al. 2014; Lu et al.
2012). Biochars produced from animal litter and solid
waste feedstocks exhibit lower surface areas compared
to biochars produced from crop residue and wood
biomass, even at higher pyrolysis temperatures (Lu
et al. 2012). This may be due to the low C content, low
volatile matter content and high molar H/C and O/C
ratios in the latter biomass samples, leading to the
formation of extensive cross-linkages (Bourke et al.
2007). Chen et al. (2008) showed that decreased H/C
and O/C ratios were related to a higher aromaticity and
lower polarity of biochars derived from pine needles.
Tag et al. (2016) observed the highest carbon content
in the linogcellulosic biochar (vine pruning—72.3%;
orange pomace—68.1% and poultry litter—56.6%)
and the lowest in the algal biochar (45.1%) at 600 C.
Zielin´ska et al. (2015) shows that sewage sludge-
biochar had lower carbon content (ranged from 18.1 to
27.8%). An increase of carbon content is associated
with the loss of –OH surface functional groups as a
result of dehydration (Zielin´ska et al. (2015) however
different types of biomass behave differently, which is
result of a different kind of graphitization of carbon
into well-organized layers (Uchimiya et al. 2011b).
Volatile matters of biochars decreased and ﬁxed
carbon of biochars increased differently depending
on ash content of biomass and biomass type (Tag et al.
2016). This is due to the fact that the volatile matter
fraction of combustible carbon inside the biomass
decreased. This occurred because the organic com-
pounds in animal waste are more labile and (compared
to wood biochars) are more rapidly lost as pyrolysis
temperature increases, before the formation of biochar
recalcitrant compounds (Domingues et al. 2017).
3.2 Speciﬁc surface area
Speciﬁc surface area is one of the most important
properties of biochar and is dependent on feedstock
type (Chen et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2015). Tag et al.
(2016) discovered that biochars obtained from orange
pomace and vine pruning, with low ash content, had
low surface area (1.2 m2/g and 8.1 m2/g). Probably
this means that the pores within those biochars were
dead-ended (Sharma et al. 2004). Type of feedstock
causes the release of volatile matter and creates more
pores (Shaaban et al. 2014). The increase in the
porosity of biochar is due to the decomposition of
lignin, the quick release of H2 and CH4 and the
reaction of aromatic condensation as the temperature
increases (Chen et al. 2012; Zhao et al. 2017). Kajina
and Rousset (2018) reported that biochar produced
from sugar cane leaves had a higher pore size (0.1 m2/
g) and speciﬁc surface area (253.2 m2/g) than biochar
produced from coconut shell (total pore size = 0.1 m2/
g and speciﬁc surface area = 25.8 m2/g). El-Gamal
et al. (2017) observed also that sugarcane-biochar had
higher pore size (0.1 m2/g) and speciﬁc surface area
(185.6 m2/g) than rice husks-biochar (total pore
size = 0.1 m2/g and speciﬁc surface area = 154.7 m2/
g).This indicates different thermal degradation and

content of lignin and cellulose (El-Gamal et al. 2017).
This was also conﬁrmed by Apaydın-Varol and Pu¨tu¨n
(2012).
They
reported
that
pine
cone-biochars
(1.8 m2/g) and peanut shell-biochars (2.0 m2/g) have
higher surface area compared with soybean cake-
biochar (0.5 m2/g) and corn stalk-biochar (0.8 m2/g).
This can be also attributed to the presence of high
amounts of lignin in the biomass samples (Raveendran
and Ganesh 1998). O¨ zc¸imen and Ersoy-Meric¸boyu
(2010) shows that porosity, total pore volume and
speciﬁc surface area values of biochar derived from
apricot stone (0.1%, 0.2 ml/g and 11.6 m2/g), derived
from hazelnut shell (0.1%, 0.1 ml/g and 14.7 m2/g)
and derived from grape seed (0.1%, 0.2 ml/g and
14.5 m2/g) were found higher than their biomass from
apricot stone (0.1%, 0.1 ml/g and 10.5 m2/g), from
hazelnut shell (0.1%, 0.1 ml/g and 5.8 m2/g), and
from grape seed (0.1%, 0.1 ml/g and 10.6 m2/g). The
difference can be attributed to the different degrada-
tion of cellulose or lignin.
Surface area increases during pyrolysis due to the
decomposition of cellulose and hemicelluloses, and
the formation of channel structures (Ahmad et al.
2012).
The
non-combustible
component
content
depends on the feedstock material and has an inﬂuence
on the speciﬁc surface area (Wang et al. 2015). The
non-combustible component corresponds to the mois-
ture and ash content (Pichtel 2014). The non-com-
bustible component content of the herbaceous biochar
was higher than that of the woody biochar, which can
be attributed to the fact that grass biochar, has a lower
speciﬁc surface area (Wang et al. 2015). The lower
surface area is also probably due to inorganic material
that partially ﬁlls or blocks the micropores (Lee et al.
2010). Ronsse et al. (2012) observed that higher
amount of inorganic (i.e. ash content) in the biomass
feedstock negatively correlate with speciﬁc surface
area in the biochars. Wood-biochar offers the highest
potential of surface area (127.0 m2/g) as all other
biochar types (straw-biochar: 22.0 m2/g; green waste-
biochar: 46.0 m2/g; algae-biochar: 19.0 m2/g). Wood-
biochar had the lowest ash content (0.2%) than straw-
biochar (7.9%, green waste-biochar (3.5%) and algae-
biochar (38.4%). This is possibly explained by fusion
of molten ash ﬁlling up pores in the biochar, thereby
decreasing accessible surface area (Ronsse et al.
2012). Darmstadt et al. (2000) observed higher surface
area for the softwoods (326.0 m2/g) than the hard-
woods (221.0 m2/g) feedstock. The higher surface
area of the charcoal produced from softwood bark may
be explained by a partial activation of this sample by
the water present in the feedstock and by creation of
voids by evolving steam (Darmstadt et al. 2000). The
less dense composition of the softwoods renders the
more susceptible to thermal decomposition, resulting
in more vesicles and pores throughout the wood
structure, which effectively increases the surface area
(Mukome et al. 2013),
3.3 CEC
The CEC of biochar depends on the type of feedstock.
For example, the CEC of biochars derived from pig
manure (32.7 cmol/kg) was lower than that of biochars
produced from chicken manure (81.4 cmol.kg) at
500 C (Cely et al. 2015). However, the CEC of
biochars derived from paper mill waste (9.0–18.0
cmol/kg) (Van Zwieten et al. 2010) was signiﬁcantly
lower than the CEC of biochars derived from sugar
cane bagasse (122.0 cmol/kg) (Carrier et al. 2012).
This difference was observed because biomass with a
high content of ash can produce biochar with a higher
CEC (Yang et al. 2015). The reason for this ability
might be that alkali and alkali metals in biomass
promote the formation of O-containing surface func-
tional groups (Cely et al. 2015; Tag et al. 2016). Thus,
the CEC of manure-derived biochar is higher than that
of woody biochar (Tag et al. 2016). Tag et al. (2016)
observed that CEC was the highest in algal (57.5 cmol/
kg) and poultry litter (48.4 cmol/kg) derived biochars
and the lowest in biochars produced from orange
pomace (29.9 cmol/kg) at 500 C. Non-wood-derived
biochars had increased CEC and surface acidity when
compared to the wood biochars (Mukome et al. 2013).
Similar results were reported by Gaskin et al. (2008),
who found a signiﬁcantly higher CEC for biochar from
poultry litter (38.3 cmol/kg) than for biochars pro-
duced from peanut hulls (4.6 cmol/kg) and pine chips
(5.0 cmol/kg) at 500 C. This decrease could be in part
due to the reduction of the content of oxygenated
functional groups on the biochar surface (Singh and
Cowie 2010). Suliman et al. (2016) observed that
biochars derived from Douglas ﬁr wood had higher
CEC than Douglas ﬁr bark-biochar and hybrid poplar-
biochar. This difference could be attributed to the
combination of carboxylic functional groups, which
contribute most of the CEC among the acidic
123

functional groups, and speciﬁc surface area (Singh and
Cowie 2010).
3.4 pH
The pH of biochars is generally alkaline (from 7.1 to
10.5) (Inyang et al. 2010; Lehmann et al. 2011). Yuan
et al. (2011) reported that biochars produced from corn
straw, peanut and soybean (at a temperature of
300 C) were alkaline (9.4, 8.6 and 7.7, respectively),
while the pH values of biochar produced from canola
straw were acidic (around 6.5). Differences in pH can
result from biomass type. Biochar produced from
wood has an average pH lower by 2 pH units than the
values for other biomasses formed under similar
pyrolysis conditions (Tag et al. 2016). Mukome
et al. (2013) reported that non-wood-derived biochars
have higher pH values (about 3.4 units). The basicity
of the non-wood-derived biochar arises from the
presence of salts (carbonates and chlorides of potas-
sium and calcium in the ash) (Montes-Mora´n et al.
2004). El-Gamal et al. (2017) reported that the pH
value of sugar cane-biochar (8.6) was lower than rice
husks-biochar (8.9). This result could be due to the
sugar cane-biochar (19.1%) had lower ash content
than rice husks-biochar (40.2%). Increase of the pH
value could be attributed to the concentration of non-
pyrolyzed inorganic elements and also to decomposi-
tion of organic matrix (Garcia-Jaramillo et al. 2015).
The pH of a biochar is likely to be correlated with
its contents of lignin, hemicelluloses or cellulose and
the presence of oxygen functionalities (Ronsse et al.
2012). Yuan et al. (2011) reported that the –COO– and
–O– groups and the carbonate content of the biochars
were responsible for the alkaline properties. Mukome
et al. (2013) shows that biochar pH correlated best
with O content (R2 = 0.7), corroborating previous
ﬁndings that biochar basicity resulted from oxygen-
rich functional groups such as c-pyrone-type, chro-
mene, diketone, or quinine groups (Montes-Mora´n
et al. 2004). The formation of compounds such as
levoglucosan (from pyrolysis of cellulose material)
and its by products (levoglucosenone, furfural, 2,3-
butanedione and 5-methylfurfural) results in oxygen
functional groups during the pyrolysis (Kawamoto and
Saka 2003). This process is associated with the
polymerization/condensation reactions of aliphatic
compounds and with the effect of the dehydration of
the feedstock (Zielinska et al. 2015). Additionally, Li
et al. (2013) reported that pH of biochars derived from
rice straw and rice bran was negatively correlated with
aliphatic O-alkylated carbons and anomeric O–C–O
carbons, but positively correlated with fused-ring
aromatic structures and aromatic C–O groups. Conse-
quently, a larger amount of carboxyl groups in the
obtained biochar that are reduced during pyrolysis
and/or acidic groups that become deprotonated to the
conjugated bases result in a more alkaline pH of the
biochar (Tag et al. 2016).
4 Biochar inﬂuence on soil quality
Biochar interacts physically with the soil fractions
(Verheijen et al. 2010). Sub-molecular interactions
with clay and silt particles, as well as with SOM (soil
organic matter), occur through van der Waals forces
and hydrophobic interactions (Xueyong et al. 2018).
Interactions at this scale determine the inﬂuence of
biochar on soil psychochemical properties and also on
the interactions with cations, anions and other organic
compounds in the soil (Zhu et al. 2017). These
interactions are very speciﬁc for biochar, with the
exact properties being inﬂuenced by feedstock type
and pyrolysis conditions (Janus et al. 2015; Verheijen
et al. 2010). Application of biochar can have positive
or negative effects on soil properties, including water
holding capacity (Revell et al. 2012), CEC (Albur-
querque et al. 2014), bulk density (Cabeza et al. 2018),
and speciﬁc surface area (Tomczyk et al. 2019). Data
from a few experiments concerning the application of
biochar as a soil amendment in different doses on
different soil types are presented in Table 3. Higher
biochar stability is not only useful from a climate
mitigation point of view but also for maintaining
possible positive agronomic effects over longer peri-
ods of time (Enders et al. 2012).
4.1 Physicochemical properties of soil
Biochar application to soils has been proposed as one
of the best techniques for climate change mitigation
via C sequestration in soil (Lehmann et al. 2006). The
long-term stability of biochar in soil is a key factor
affecting the decrease of CO2 emissions into the
atmosphere (Cheng et al. 2008). A recent long-term
experiment estimated that the mean residence time of
C in biochars varies from 90 to 1600 years depending
123
Rev Environ Sci Biotechnol (2020) 19:191–215

----- Page 14 (native) -----
on the labile and intermediate stable C components
(Singh et al. 2012). The changes in functional groups
and their distribution in soil microaggregates are
inﬂuenced by the presence of biochar, this being
indicative of changes in the physical protection and
processing of C in soil (Hernandez-Soriano et al.
2016). A few recent studies have shown that biochar
can reduce nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4)
emissions from soil via both biotic and abiotic
mechanisms (Jha et al. 2010; Sun et al. 2018; Van
Zwieten et al. 2009). Woolf et al. (2010) proposed a
sustainable biochar concept, through which the emis-
sion of greenhouse gases including CH4 and N2O can
be avoided. Additionally, the bioenergy produced
during the pyrolysis process offsets fossil energy
consumption (Woolf et al. 2010).
Furthermore, biochars are abundant in mineral
elements such as Na, K, Ca, Fe and Mg (Jha et al.
2010). Their concentrations increase with the pyrol-
ysis temperature (Saletnik et al. 2016) and vary with
the type of biomass (de la Rosa et al. 2014). In one
study, the highest contents of P, K and Mg (4.3, 9.9 and
2.8 g/kg, respectively) were observed in the biochar
obtained at the temperature of 500 C, while the
temperature of 400 C resulted in the maximum
contents of carbon and nitrogen (73.6% and 1.9%,
respectively) (Saletnik et al. 2016). Cantrell et al.
(2012) suggested that the various metals inherent in

animal litter may protect against the loss of volatile
material by changing the dissociation energies of
organic and inorganic C bonds. The addition of
biochar to the soil should increase the concentrations
of micronutrients that are easily available to plants
(Alburquerque et al. 2014; Jha et al. 2010). Improve-
ment of soil physical, chemical, and biological
properties
promotes
plant
productivity
through
increasing the amount and availability of nutrient
elements, reducing nutrient leaching and mitigating
losses of gaseous components (Ding et al. 2016). It is
widely known that a high CEC corresponds to high
nutrient contents (Liang et al. 2006). Guo et al. (2012)
showed that biochar has a high CEC and is expected to
retain more nutrients in soil and to decrease nutrient
leaching.
Glaser et al. (2002) suggested the oxidation of
aromatic C and formation of carboxyl groups to be the
main reason for high CEC. This formation of carboxyl
groups or other functional groups with a negative
charge in the pH range of soils can be the result of two
principally different processes: (1) surface oxidation
of the biochar particles themselves and (2) adsorption
of highly oxidized organic matter onto biochar
surfaces (Lehmann et al. 2005). Low-temperature
biochars are often employed due to more enhanced
soil-biochar interactions in relation to high-tempera-
ture biochars (Joseph et al. 2010). Such low-temper-
ature biochar also yields a greater recovery of C and
other nutrients (feedstock dependent), which are
usually lost at higher temperatures (Keiluweit et al.
2010). The low-temperature product, which has been
pyrolysed between 400 and 500 C, has its main
advantage in increasing CEC. Furthermore, this
biochar type sequesters soil C, however, not to the
same extent as high-temperature biochar (Antal and
Grønli
2003).
High-temperature
biochars
conse-
quently have lesser reactivity in soils than lower-
temperature biochars, which tend to have a better
impact on soil fertility (Antal and Grønli 2003;
Steinbeiss et al. 2009). Liang et al. (2006) reported
that the CEC was up to 1.9 times higher in Anthrosols
with a high biochar concentration than in control soils.
The same results were obtained by Sombroek et al.
(1993). The changes in soil properties that occur with
biochar amendments, such as increases in organic
carbon, the contents of mineral elements and values of
CEC have an inﬂuence on soil pH (Rutkowska et al.
2014). Hass et al. (2012) observed that the effect of
biochar on soil pH increased with application rate and
varied among different types of biochar. The increases
in pH and the corresponding reduction in exchange-
able Al could also have improved the chemical
environment (e.g. soil pH, soil organic matter, phos-
phorus (P) or potassium (K) contents) of the biochar-
amended soils for radish plants (Abdulaha-Al Baquy
et al. 2017). Chan et al. (2007) reported that the pH
increases were accompanied by a signiﬁcant reduction
in exchangeable Al by [ 50.0% at the higher rates of
biochar application, i.e., 50.0 and 100.0 t/ha.
Application of biochar can have a positive effect on
another physicochemical property of soil: speciﬁc
surface area (Anawar et al. 2015). Liang et al. (2006)
reported that Anthrosols had a (up to 4.8 times) higher
surface area than other soils due to their higher biochar
concentrations. Similarly, Tomczyk et al. (2019)
showed that the speciﬁc surface area of the non-
modiﬁed silty Haplic Luvisol soil is almost three times
higher than that of the sandy Haplic Podzol soil;
amendment with biochars led to an increase of the
speciﬁc surface area values in both soils. Modiﬁed
Haplic Luvisol had a higher surface area due to higher
biochar content (approx. 12.7–21.9 m2/g) than the
non-modiﬁed loamy soil and modiﬁed Haplic Podzol
also had higher surface area due to higher biochar
content (approx. 2.5–11.6 m2/g) than the non-modi-
ﬁed sandy soil. This suggests that Haplic Podzol had
weaker interactions with than Haplic Luvisol. The
larger speciﬁc surface area of Haplic Luvisol soil may
be the result of the higher amounts of organic carbon
as well as clay and silt materials in Haplic Luvisol in
comparison to Haplic Podzol soil. Effect of biochar on
soil speciﬁc surface area varies among biochar types.
Lei and Zhang (2013) reported that wood biochar has a
higher speciﬁc surface area (124.0 m2/g) than biochar
from the dairy industry (83.4 m2/g). The application of
biochar has been observed to increase the amount of
macropores (with a maximum increase of 59.0%), and
the amount of macropores in biochar increases with
the pyrolysis temperature (Kutilek et al. 2006; Lei and
Zhang 2013). The increase of speciﬁc surface area and
porosity caused better water sorption (Nair et al.
2017).
Fertilization with biochar also has a positive effect
on water holding capacity (Duong et al. 2017).
Biochar can absorb water up to 5.0 times its own
weight (Ga˛sior and Tic 2017). Biochar can increase
the moisture and content of organic and inorganic
123

nitrogen compounds, which reduces lime in the litter,
thereby reducing the pH of the litter and manure,
which in turn reduces ammonia emissions (Gerlach
2014). Some studies have also shown how biochar
changes water retention in soil. The increase in carbon
content achieved by adding biochar to the soil
contributes to stimulating the humiﬁcation and carbon
sequestration processes as well as the improvement of
soil density and water retention (Nair et al. 2017).
Cybulak et al. (2016) reported that the application of
biochar increases the hygroscopic moisture content of
soil (by about 1.5–3.0%), which would be very
beneﬁcial to dry and degraded soils. Smaller biochar
particle sizes can also increase water retention but may
reduce saturated ﬂow (Blanco-Canqui 2017). How-
ever, Glaser et al. (2002) reported that Amazonian
charcoal-rich anthrosols had a ﬁeld water retention
capacity 18.0% higher than that of surrounding soil
without charcoal. It can be expected that charcoal
addition may cause an increase or decrease in the
water retention of soils, but the direction of the effect
will depend on the original characteristics of the soil
(Woolf 2008). Tryon (1948) showed that charcoal
increased the available moisture in sandy soil but had
no effect in loamy soil and decreased the available
moisture in clay soil. This suggests that charcoal
addition may be ill-suited to clay soils. Conversely, an
increase of available moisture observed in sandy soils
may make biochar a useful tool in the reversal of
desertiﬁcation (Woolf 2008). Usowicz et al. (2016)
described that biochar amendment to fallow land
caused decreases in bulk density, particle density,
thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity. How-
ever, no signiﬁcant effect of surface-applied biochar
was observed on the soil thermal conductivity and
thermal diffusivity under grassland. Moreover, bio-
char application to agricultural soils can change the
surface albedo, which can counteract the climate-
mitigating potential of biochar (Usowicz et al. 2016).
If there is greater albedo, then less UV will be
absorbed by the soil (Kuppusamy et al. 2016). Biochar
amendments caused reductions of albedo under both
grassland and fallow land (Usowicz et al. 2016).
4.2 Inorganic and organic contaminates in soil
Numerous studies have proven that biochar increases
the ability of soil to adsorb heavy metals and other
contaminants, which is important for environmental
protection and management (Tomczyk et al. 2019;
Wei et al. 2018). Biochars have a carbonized and a
non-carbonized fraction, which may interact with soil
contaminants through oxygen-containing carboxyl,
phenolic, hydroxyl and lactonic surface functional
groups (Ahmad et al. 2014a). These fractions can play
different roles in the adsorption process (Cao et al.
2009). The carbonized fraction is similar to the
‘‘glassy’’ fraction (analogous to glassy polymers),
and the non-carbonized fraction is similar to the ‘‘soft’’
fraction (analogous to rubbery polymers) (Xia and
Ball 1999). Biochar can be considered as a soil
amendment that reduces the biotoxicity of pollutants
(Cha et al. 2016; Li et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2019).
The
effectiveness
of
contamination
removal
depends on the biochars speciﬁc surface area and
cation exchange capacity (Ahmad et al. 2014b;
Kołodyn´ska et al. 2012; Touray et al. 2014), as well
as on the kind of interfering ions (Bogusz et al. 2015),
pH of the solution, the dosage of biochar applied (Kılıc¸
et al. 2013; Tomczyk et al. 2019), soil type, soil pH,
contact time, metal concentration and temperature
(Bradl 2004; Dube et al. 2001; Srivastava et al. 2005)
as well as biochar type. Many studies have investi-
gated heavy metal adsorption by biochars, including
the adsorption of copper ions from water by a
soil:biochar mixture at different pH values (Tomczyk
et al. 2019), adsorption of heavy metal ions on kaolin
(Srivastava et al. 2005), adsorption of zinc, copper and
lead on zeolite (Peric´ et al. 2004), adsorption of
platinum (IV) ions in loess soil (Bojanowska and
Jackowska 2005), and the adsorption of heavy metal
ions on biochars (Kołodyn´ska et al. 2012). All of the
above studies were aimed at understanding how heavy
metal ions are adsorbed from the liquid phase to the
surface of the adsorbent and how the presence of
biochar inﬂuences this process in soil (Liu et al. 2014).
Colloids and organic ligands (Kerndorf and Schintzer
1980; Lion et al. 1982) as well as inorganic ones
(Srivastava et al. 2005) have an inﬂuence on the
adsorption process. Cao et al. (2009) investigated the
sorption capacities of dairy manure biochar produced
at low temperatures (200 C and 350 C) and found
that the biochar was six times more effective in
removing lead (Pb) from wastewater than a commer-
cial activated carbon. Tong et al. (2011) investigated
the copper adsorption capacity of three different
biochars obtained by the pyrolysis of nut straw, soy
and rapeseed. They found that the highest adsorptive
123
206

----- Page 17 (native) -----
capacity was exhibited by the biochar obtained from
nut straw, then from soybeans, and then from
rapeseed. They proved that the copper adsorption
occurs through the formation of complexes with
surface groups, speciﬁcally –COOH and phenolic
groups (Tong et al. 2011). However, Karami et al.
(2011) reported that the addition of oak biochar (in the
amount of 20.0% (v/v)) to soil reduced Cu sorption by
approx. 69.0%. Xu and Zhao (2013) showed that
biochar from straws and peanut (in the amounts of 3.0
and 5.0% (v/v)) increased the Cu sorption capacities of
Oxisol, Utisol and Ultestinated soils, whereas biochar
from rice reduced Cu in Ultisol derived from Quater-
nary red earth at the same doses (Jiang et al. 2012).
However, woody biochar increased Cu adsorption
onto Haplic Podzol at pH 3.0 and 5.0, with the most
considerable changes observed at pH 5.0 (increase in
adsorption of 23.5%) (Tomczyk et al. 2019).
Biochar may also adsorb other contaminants, such
as PAH, antibiotics, and pesticides (Mui et al. 2010;
Xu et al. 2011). For example, Chen and Yuan (2011)
investigated the effect of biochars (obtained from pine
needles at different temperatures) on the sorption of
the PAHs naphtalene and phenantrene in soil. Biochar
produced at high pyrolysis temperatures (400 and
700 C) demonstrated higher efﬁciency in the sorption
afﬁnity of biochar-soil than biochar obtained at low
pyrolysis temperatures (100 and 300 C). Phenan-
threne sorption of above 99.0% was controlled by
biochar produced at 300 and 400 C when present at
5.0%. When the biochar content was only 0.5% for
biochar 300 C and 0.1% for biochar 400 C, the
relative contributions of biochar and soil to total
phenanthrene sorption were similar, but when the
biochar content was increased to 5.0%, phenanthrene
sorption of 90.0% and 98.0% was contributed by
biochar produced at 300 and 400 C, respectively
(Chen and Yuan 2011). With the addition of 5.0%
biochar at 100 C, 5.0% biochar at 300 C, 5%
biochar at 400 C, and 2.0% biochar at 700 C,
sorption of phenanthrene was enhanced by 1.8–3.4
times, 5.1–10.4 times, 23.0–70.6 times, and 43.7–85.5
times in comparison with unamended soil (Chen and
Yuan 2011). A similar phenomenon was observed for
naphthalene sorption; the enhanced intensities were
1.7–3.2 times, 28.3–113.0 times, 58.6–314.0 times,
and 138.0–1170.0 times the sorption of amended soil
with a 5.0% series of biochar produced at 100, 300,
400, and 700 C, respectively. The biochar dominated
the overall sorption of naphtalene when added to the
soil at a proportion of at least 0.5% for the biochar
produced at 300 C content and 0.1% for the biochar
produced at 400 C (Chen and Yuan 2011). Overall,
for biochar-soils with the same biochar content, the
saturated adsorption capacity of a sorbent estimated
from the high concentration data values for PAHs
increased with the biochar pyrolysis temperature in the
order of 100 \ 300 \ 400 \ 700 C (Chen and Chen
2009; Chen and Yuan 2011). Li et al. (2019) inves-
tigated the sorption of sulfadiazine and tetracycline on
wood biochar obtained at 600–800 C. The authors
analysed the effects of porosity of biochar, size of
antibiotic molecules and pH on the sorption process. It
was found that the production of biochar at a higher
temperature improved its mesoporosity (from 34.3 to
124.0 m2/g) and its afﬁnity for antibiotic sorption
from the aquatic environment (from 6.42 to 163.0 mg/
g for tetracycline sorption and from 2.20 to 261.0 mg/
g for sulfadiazine sorption). The sorption efﬁciency of
mesoporous biochar was associated with a higher
internal porosity, which promoted the adsorption of
smaller-size antibiotic molecules (Li et al. 2019).
Additionally, desorption studies indicate irreversible
adsorption of antibiotics, i.e., biochar adsorbs them
permanently and they will probably not leach out in
the soil (Li et al. 2019). Furthermore, Garcia-Perez
(2008) found that biochars produced at temperatures
above 700 C are typically related to the production of
PAHs, which are hazardous because of their carcino-
genic and mutagenic properties, and low-temperature
biochars (pyrolysed in the temperature range of
350–600 C) appear to carry fewer toxic inferences.
Therefore, biochar that is produced as a soil fertility
amendment needs to be speciﬁcally aimed at car-
bonizing the biomass material under moist conditions
and at low temperatures (Novak et al. 2009).
4.3 Biological properties of soils
The pore system of biochar provides a safe habitat for
soil microorganisms (i.e., mycorrhizal fungi, actino-
mycetes bacteria) (Compant et al. 2010). These
microorganisms are food for protozoa, mites, nema-
todes and other soil biota (Briones 2014). Biochar
helps maintain microbiological populations at a higher
level and simultaneously reduces the greenhouse gas
emissions of soil (Compant et al. 2010). Weyers and
Spokas (2011) reported short-term negative effects

and long-term null effects of biochar amendment on
earthworm activity in soil. Biochar derived from rice
residues was observed to have a negative effect on the
earthworm population that was related to the increase
in soil pH induced by the biochar (Haefele et al. 2011).
Li et al. (2011) recommended that a wet biochar
application to soil could help mitigate negative effects
on earthworms by preventing desiccation. Also, a
positive effect of biochar amendment has been
observed in soil enzymatic activity, which is an
indicator of higher soil quality (Mierzwa-Hersztek
et al. 2016; Ouyang et al. 2014). Ameloot et al. (2013)
and Mierzwa-Hersztek et al. (2016) showed that
biochar amendment caused an increase in the activity
of dehydrogenase and urease in soil. Dehydrogenase
activity increased by 19.0% and urease activity by
44.0% (Mierzwa-Hersztek et al. 2016). Moreover,
Mierzwa-Hersztek et al. (2016) reported that the
addition of biochar to soil reduced soil acidity and
increased the content of nitrogen and organic carbon.
5 Conclusions
This paper provides a review of the effects of
temperature and type of feedstock on the physico-
chemical properties of biochar and its potential use as
a soil conditioner.
The physicochemical properties (pH, speciﬁc sur-
face area, pore size, CEC, volatile mater, ash and
carbon content) of biochar change with pyrolysis
temperature and feedstock kind. Studies show that
CEC and volatile matter decreased with increasing
pyrolysis temperature, whereas pH, speciﬁc surface
area, ash and carbon content, pore volume increased
with the increase in pyrolysis temperature. Increasing
temperature also decreased the number of acidic
functional groups, especially carboxylic functional
groups, and caused appearance of basic functional
groups.
Biochar produced
at
high
temperatures
(600–700 C) exhibits a highly aromatic nature with
well-organized C layers. This is most likely due to the
degree of organic matter decomposition and the
formation of micropores. In addition, this set of
physicochemical properties is also a consequence of
destruction of aliphatic alkyls and ester groups as well
as the exposure of the aromatic lignin cores to high
pyrolysis temperatures.
The moisture, as well as lignin and cellulose
content in biomass have considerable inﬂuence on
biochar formation. These can be attributed to the
presence of different organic constituents in feedstock.
Lignin is amorphous and hydrophobic polymer with
high molecular weight and numerous functional
groups of aromatic substructure. Cellulose and hemi-
celluloses are consisting of simple sugar monomer,
which decompose at a temperature lower than 450 C.
Cellulose present in the biomass helps in the formation
of tar, while high lignin content is favourable for char
production. Biochars produced from animal litter and
solid waste feedstocks exhibit lower surface areas,
carbon content, volatile matter and high CEC as
compared to biochars produced from crop residue and
wood biomass, even at higher pyrolysis temperatures.
Biochar derived from manures, sewage sludge or crop
residues show higher potential as nutrient source or
inorganic sorbent. Wood-biochar possesses consider-
able merit for the improvement: (1) organic pollutants
removal (antibiotics, pesticides), (2) carbon seques-
tration and (3) soil pH, due to the high carbon and ash
content, as well as high speciﬁc surface area, volatile
matter and alkaline pH.
Biochar reveals the potential to contribute to
resolving economic, public health and environmental
problems that are widespread and need to be over-
come. In summary, more research is needed regarding
biochar technology, suitability and sustainability as a
soil fertilizer or decontaminator.
