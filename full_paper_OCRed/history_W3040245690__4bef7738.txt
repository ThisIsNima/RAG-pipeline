Abstract
The field of microbiome research has evolved rapidly over the past few decades and has become a topic of great
scientific and public interest. As a result of this rapid growth in interest covering different fields, we are lacking a clear
commonly agreed definition of the term “microbiome.” Moreover, a consensus on best practices in microbiome research
is missing. Recently, a panel of international experts discussed the current gaps in the frame of the European-funded
MicrobiomeSupport project. The meeting brought together about 40 leaders from diverse microbiome areas, while more
than a hundred experts from all over the world took part in an online survey accompanying the workshop. This article
excerpts the outcomes of the workshop and the corresponding online survey embedded in a short historical introduction
and future outlook. We propose a definition of microbiome based on the compact, clear, and comprehensive description
of the term provided by Whipps et al. in 1988, amended with a set of novel recommendations considering the latest
technological developments and research findings. We clearly separate the terms microbiome and microbiota and provide
a comprehensive discussion considering the composition of microbiota, the heterogeneity and dynamics of microbiomes
in time and space, the stability and resilience of microbial networks, the definition of core microbiomes, and functionally
relevant keystone species as well as co-evolutionary principles of microbe-host and inter-species interactions within the
microbiome. These broad definitions together with the suggested unifying concepts will help to improve standardization
of microbiome studies in the future, and could be the starting point for an integrated assessment of data resulting in a
more rapid transfer of knowledge from basic science into practice. Furthermore, microbiome standards are important for
solving new challenges associated with anthropogenic-driven changes in the field of planetary health, for which the
understanding of microbiomes might play a key role.

Introduction
Improving our knowledge of microbiomes has become a
popular topic over the past two decades not only in the
scientific community, but also among the general public,
especially as an area of great promise for new medical
treatments. The human microbiome is now even consid-
ered to be our “last organ” [1]. Research on the human
microbiome has advanced from a fledgling field to a
flourishing area of medical research with more than
US$1.7 billion being spent only over the past decade
alone [2]. Promising results from microbiome research
also boosted the whole “microbiome market” and private
investment into companies and startups (www.global-en-
gage.com). In addition to human health, microbiome re-
search provides a foundation for a much broader scope
of applications [3]. Advances in engineering of environ-
mental microbiomes will replace toxic chemicals in agri-,
horti-, and aquaculture in the future and stimulate a
more sustainable use of environmental resources, as well
as improve our food processing [4–9]. Agricultural prod-
ucts based on the microbiota are one of the fastest grow-
ing sectors in agronomy with a Compound Annual
Growth Rate (CAGR) of 15–18% and a predicted value
of over 10 billion US dollars by 2025 [10]. Moreover,
microbiome research may provide solutions on how
humans and other life forms on Earth can contribute to
withstand one of our main problems: the anthropogenic-
driven climate change [11].
Historically, the field of microbiome research has emerged
from environmental microbiome research (microbial ecology)
and provides an interdisciplinary platform for many fields,
e.g., agriculture, food science, biotechnology, bioeconomy,
mathematics (informatics, statistics, modeling), plant path-
ology, and especially human medicine. The new field has
already delivered novel and important concepts for describing
host-microbial interactions such as the holobiont theory or
meta-organism concept [12–14]. Further, principles of coevo-
lution, co-selection, and stress response within microbiomes
go far beyond the traditional scope of these concepts [15, 16].
Stegen et al. [17] suggest a unified conceptual framework for
prediction and control of microbiomes. Significantly, there
has been a fundamental paradigm shift in our understanding
of microorganisms and it is now accepted that all eukaryotes
are meta-organisms and must be considered together with
their microbiota as an inseparable functional unit [18]. This
concept also considers the fact that pathogens represent only
a tiny fraction of microorganisms; diversity loss can result in a
so-called “dysbiosis” that describes the altered composition of
microbes, which has a cascading impact on the immune sys-
tem and offers an advantage for emergence and outbreak of
pathogens [19–21].
Considering the fundamental nature of microbial life
and diversity in relation to larger organisms and vice
versa, scientists are calling for a rethinking of the role of
microorganisms [22, 23]. In spite of the substantial
popularity of microbiome research across diverse fields,
this extremely fast-growing discipline faces a variety of
challenges. The lack of data standardization as a matter
of continuous development of new techniques and
equipment, as well as the urgent need for better coord-
ination and collaboration across the field of microbiome
research, was recently listed as the most important chal-
lenges facing microbiome researchers [2]. Furthermore,
a consistent criticism has been that microbiome research
is more driven by methods than by hypotheses or con-
cepts [24]. To provide mechanistic insights in microbiota
functioning is not only important for the human micro-
biome, it affects all areas in this research field. However,
a clear or consensus definition of “microbiome” among
researchers from diverse fields remains debatable [25].
The main goal of this article is to overcome the obsta-
cles faced in microbiome research by proposing an explicit
definition for the term microbiome and building a com-
mon ground for microbiome researchers. Our definition
builds on previous definitions with amendments covering
areas that are still emerging and thus exposed to fluctua-
tions. The article is based on discussions in the frame of a
workshop which took place on 6 March 2019 in Tulln
(Austria) as part of the MicrobiomeSupport project [26],
which aims to establish international research standards.
The workshop brought together leading microbiome re-
searchers from academic, governmental, and industry
groups representing diverse areas of expertise. Prior to the
workshop, an online survey was sent to address critical
questions on the definition of the term microbiome as
well as challenges in microbiome research and develop-
ment to which more than a hundred experts from all over
the world responded. The outcomes of the survey and
subsequent workshop discussions form the foundation for
the proposed definition of the term microbiome, and the
set of amendments containing the rules and baselines for
microbiome research is described here. Moreover, this art-
icle provides an overview on the historical development of
microbial research and shows how this development
shaped the various existing microbiome definitions. We
provide a recommendation based on an existing definition
of the term microbiome and lay out principles for this
choice. As microbiome research is driven by highly so-
phisticated technology development and grapples with an
enormous quantity of complex data, we also discuss the
definition of microbiome in relation to ongoing technical
developments. In addition, we provide specific recommen-
dations to stimulate microbiome researchers to generate
more
detailed
information
related
to
microbiome
functionality, increase the capacities to integrate and com-
pare data obtained in different studies, and facilitate a
more efficient transfer of results from basic science to
application.

From microorganisms to microbiomes: a historical
overview
Taking major historical developments into account is im-
portant to understand how microbiome research has man-
ifested itself as core discipline in modern life. The field of
microbiome research originated in microbiology and
started back in the seventieth century. Research progress
has often been driven by the development of new tech-
niques and equipment. Interestingly, many technological
inventions have boosted microbiological research in such
a manner and caused paradigm shifts in our understand-
ing of health and disease (Fig. 1). Since infectious diseases
have affected human populations throughout most of his-
tory, medical microbiology was the earliest focus of re-
search
and
public
interest.
Additionally,
food
microbiology is an old field of empirical applications. The
development of the first microscopes allowed the discov-
ery of a new, unknown world and led to the identification
of microorganisms. Access to the previously invisible
world opened the eyes and the minds of the researchers of
the seventieth century. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek investi-
gated diverse bacteria of various shapes, fungi, and proto-
zoa, which he called animalcules, mainly from water, mud,
and dental plaque samples, and discovered biofilms as a
first indication of microorganisms interacting within com-
plex communities. Robert Koch’s explanation of the origin
of human and animal diseases as a consequence of micro-
bial infection and development of the concept of patho-
genicity was an important milestone in microbiology.
These
findings
shifted
the
focus
of
the
research
community and the public on the role of microorganisms
as disease-forming agents that needed to be eliminated.
However, comprehensive research over the past century
has shown that only a small proportion of microorganisms
are associated with disease or pathogenicity; the over-
whelming majority of microbes are essential for ecosystem
functioning and known for beneficial interactions with
other microbes as well as macroorganisms. At the end of
the ninetieth century, microbial ecology started with the
pioneering work by Martinus W. Beijerinck and Sergei N.
Winogradski. The newly established science of environ-
mental microbiology resulted in another paradigm shift:
microorganisms are everywhere in natural environments,
often associated with hosts and, for the first time, benefi-
cial effects on their hosts were reported [27, 28]. Subse-
quently, the concept that microorganisms exist as single
cells began to change as it became increasingly obvious
that microbes occur within complex assemblages in which
species interactions and communication are critical to
population
dynamics
and
functional
activities
[29].
Discovery of DNA, the development of sequencing tech-
nologies, PCR, and cloning techniques enabled the investi-
gation
of
microbial
communities
using
cultivation-
independent, DNA and RNA-based approaches [30]. A
further important step was the introduction of phylogen-
etic markers such as the 16S rRNA gene for microbial
community analysis by Carl Woese and George E. Fox in
1977 [31]. Today, we are able to barcode bacteria, archaea,
fungi, algae, and protists in their natural habitats, e.g., by
targeting
their
16S
and
18S
rRNA
genes,

transcribed spacer (ITS), or, alternatively, specific func-
tional regions of genes coding for specific enzymes [32–
34]. Another major paradigm shift was initiated at the be-
ginning of this century and continues through today, as
new sequencing technologies and accumulated sequence
data have highlighted both the ubiquity of microbial com-
munities in association within higher organisms and the
critical roles of microbes in human, animal, and plant
health [35]. These new possibilities have revolutionized
microbial ecology, because the analysis of genomes and
metagenomes in a high-throughput manner provides effi-
cient methods for addressing the functional potential of
individual microorganisms as well as of whole communi-
ties in their natural habitats [36, 37]. Multi-omics tech-
nologies including metatranscriptome, metaproteome, or
metabolome approaches now provide detailed information
on microbial activities in the environment. Based on the
rich foundation of data, the cultivation of microbes, which
was often ignored or underestimated in the last 30 years,
has gained new importance, and high throughput culturo-
mics is now an important part of the toolbox to study
microbiomes. The high potential and enormous power of
combining multiple “omics” techniques to analyze host-
microbe interactions are highlighted in several reviews
[17, 38].
Defining the microbiome—current definitions and
gaps
Microbial communities have commonly been defined as
the collection of microorganisms living together. More
specifically, microbial communities are defined as multi-
species assemblages, in which (micro) organisms interact
with each other in a contiguous environment [39]. In
1988, Whipps and colleagues working on the ecology of
rhizosphere microorganisms provided the first definition
of the term microbiome [40]. They described the
“microbiome” as a combination of the words “micro”
and “biome”, naming a “characteristic microbial commu-
nity” in a “reasonably well-defined habitat which has dis-
tinct physio-chemical properties” as their “theatre of
activity” (Table 1). This definition represents a substan-
tial advancement of the definition of a microbial com-
munity, as it defines a microbial community with
distinct properties and functions and its interactions
with its environment, resulting in the formation of spe-
cific ecological niches. However, there are many other
microbiome definitions that have been published in the
last few decades. The currently most cited definition by
Lederberg [42] describes microbiomes within an eco-
logical context, as a community of commensal, sym-
biotic, and pathogenic microorganisms within a body
space or other environment. Marchesi and Ravel focused
in their definition on the genomes and microbial (and
viral) gene expression patterns and proteomes in a given
Table 1 Microbiome definitions
Ecological definitions
Definitions based on ecology describe the microbiome following the
concepts derived from the ecology of multicellular organisms. The
main issue here is that the theories from the macro-ecology do not
always fit the rules in the microbial world.
“A convenient ecological framework in which to examine biocontrol
systems is that of the microbiome. This may be defined as a
characteristic microbial community occupying a reasonably well-
defined habitat which has distinct physio-chemical properties. The
term thus not only refers to the microorganisms involved but also en-
compasses their theatre of activity ”[40].
“…This term refers to the entire habitat, including the
microorganisms (bacteria, archaea, lower and higher eurkaryotes, and
viruses), their genomes (i.e., genes), and the surrounding
environmental conditions. This definition is based on that of “biome,”
the biotic and abiotic factors of given environments. Others in the
field limit the definition of microbiome to the collection of genes and
genomes of members of a microbiota. It is argued that this is the
definition of metagenome, which combined with the environment
constitutes the microbiome. The microbiome is characterized by the
application of one or combinations of metagenomics, metabonomics,
metatranscriptomics, and metaproteomics combined with clinical or
environmental metadata” [25].
“others use the term microbiome to mean all the microbes of a
community, and in particular, for the plant microbiome, those
microbial communities associated with the plant which can live,
thrive, and interact with different tissues such as roots, shoots, leaves,
flowers, and seeds” (from Orozco-Mosqueda et al. [41]).
“Ecological community of commensal, symbiotic and pathogenic
microorganisms within a body space or other environment” [42].
Organisms/host-dependent definitions
The host-dependent definitions are based on the microbial interac-
tions with the host. The main gaps here concern the question
whether the microbial-host interaction data gained from one host
can be transferred to another. The understanding of coevolution and
selection in the host-dependent definitions is also underrepresented.
“A community of microorganisms (such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses)
that inhabit a particular environment and especially the collection of
microorganisms living in or on the human body” [43].
“Human Microbiome Project (HMP): [...] The Human Microbiome is the
collection of all the microorganisms living in association with the
human body. These communities consist of a variety of
microorganisms including eukaryotes, archaea, bacteria and viruses”
[44].
Genomic/ method-driven definitions
There is a variety of microbiome definitions available that are driven
by the methods applied. Mostly, these definitions rely on DNA
sequence-based analysis and describe microbiome as a collective
genome of microorganisms in a specific environment. The main
bottleneck here is that every new available technology will result in a
need for a new definition.
“The collective genomes of microorganisms inhabiting a particular
environment and especially the human body” [43].
“The microbiome comprises all of the genetic material within a
microbiota (the entire collection of microorganisms in a specific niche,
such as the human gut). This can also be referred to as the
metagenome of the microbiota” [45].
“Microbiome is a term that describes the genome of all the
microorganisms, symbiotic and pathogenic, living in and on all
vertebrates. The gut microbiome is comprised of the collective genome
of microbes inhabiting the gut including bacteria, archaea, viruses, and
fungi” [46].
“Different approaches to define the population provide different
information. a | Microbiota: 16S rRNA surveys are used to taxonomically
identify the microorganisms in the environment. b | Metagenome: the
genes and genomes of the microbiota, including plasmids, highlighting
the genetic potential of the population. c | Microbiome: the genes and
genomes of the microbiota, as well as the products of the microbiota
and the host environment” [47].

environment and its prevailing biotic and abiotic condi-
tions [25]. All these definitions imply that general con-
cepts of macro-ecology could be easily applied to
microbe-microbe as well as to microbe-host interactions.
However, the extent to which these concepts, developed
for macro-eukaryotes, can be applied to prokaryotes
with their different lifestyles regarding dormancy, vari-
ation of phenotype, and horizontal gene transfer [52] as
well as to micro-eukaryotes that is not quite clear. This
raises the challenge of considering an entirely novel body
of conceptual ecology models and theory for micro-
biome ecology, particularly in relation to the diverse
hierarchies of interactions of microbes with one another
and with the host biotic and abiotic environments. Many
current definitions fail to capture this complexity and
describe the term microbiome as encompassing the ge-
nomes of microorganisms only (Table 1). Merriam Web-
ster publishing platform, for example, suggests two
microbiome definitions: one describing the metagenome
and the other is the community of microorganisms, yet
still fails to capture the host and the environment as an
integral ecological component of the microbiome, rather
than an independent entity.
A revised conceptual framework will allow us to move
from cataloguing microorganisms to a more holistic view
on microbial functioning and interaction with its envir-
onment. This, however, will require substantially more
interdisciplinary interaction between scientists working
across disparate fields [2]. The variety of perspectives on
the term microbiome were a central part of discussion
within the MicrobiomeSupport workshop. Based on the
responses obtained in the online survey and workshop
discussions, participants concluded that the original def-
inition of Whipps et al. [40] is still the most comprehen-
sive one that captures the complexity of the microbiome
and the diverse facets of its ecology and evolutionary
biology. The workshop participants discussed a number
of critical points, resulting in recommendations for clari-
fications and amendments to the original Whipps and
coworkers’ definition. These amendments address (1)
members of the microbiome, (2) interactions among
members
of
the
microbiome
and
within
existing
microbial networks, (3) spatial and temporal characteris-
tics of microbiomes in their environment, (4) the core
microbiota, (5) moving from functional predictions to
phenotypes of species, and (6) microbiome—host or en-
vironmental interactions and coevolution. Below, we dis-
cuss these aspects in detail.
Members of the microbiome
The microbiota comprises all living members forming
the microbiome. Etymology and differences of both
terms are explained in Table 2. Bacteria, archaea, fungi,
algae, and small protists should be considered as mem-
bers of the microbiome [25]; most microbiome re-
searchers agree with this definition. The integration of
phages, viruses, plasmids, and mobile genetic elements is
one of the most controversial points in the definition of
the microbiome. This was also confirmed by the partici-
pants’ comments in the “microbiome definition” online
survey. The answers of the survey participants to the
question whether viruses and phages should be a part of
the microbiome provided no clear answer and stretched
from “in any case” to “definitely no.” There is also no
clear consensus as to whether extracellular DNA derived
from dead cells (so-called “relic DNA”) belongs to the
microbiome. Relic DNA can comprise up to 40% of the
sequenced DNA in soil [53] and was up to 33% of the
total bacterial DNA on average in a broader analysis of
habitats with the highest proportion of 80% in some
samples [54]. Interestingly, despite its omnipresence and
abundance, relic DNA had a minimal effect on estimates
of taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity [54]. When it
comes to the use of specific terms, a clear differentiation
between microbiome and microbiota helps to avoid the
controversy concerning the members of a microbiome
(Fig. 2). Microbiota is usually defined as the assemblage
of living microorganisms present in a defined environ-
ment [25]. As phages, viruses, plasmids, prions, viroids,
and free DNA are usually not considered as living mi-
croorganisms [55], they do not belong to the microbiota.
The term microbiome, as it was originally postulated by
Whipps and coworkers [40], includes not only the com-
munity of the microorganisms, but also their “theatre of
activity.” The latter involves the whole spectrum of mol-
ecules produced by the microorganisms, including their
Table 1 Microbiome definitions (Continued)
“Totality of genomes of a microbiota. Often used to describe the
entity of microbial traits (=functions) encoded by a microbiota.” [48]
Combined definitions
There are some microbiome definitions available that fit several
categories with their advantages and disadvantages.
“A microbiome is the ecological community of commensal, symbiotic,
and pathogenic microorganisms that literally share our body space”
[49].
“The microbiome is the sum of the microbes and their genomic
elements in a particular environment” [50].
“The genes and genomes of the microbiota, as well as the products of
the microbiota and the host environment” [51].
Table 2 Microbiome/microbiota etymology
Microbiome
The words “micro” and “biome” are of Ancient Greek origin. “Micro”
(μικρος) means small, while the term “biome” is composed of the
Greek word bíos (βιος, life) and modified by the ending “ome”
(Anglicization of Greek).
Microbiota
The words “micro” and “biota” are also of Ancient Greek origin. It is a
combination of “Micro” (μικρος, small), with the term “biota” (βιοτα),
which means the living organisms of an ecosystem or a particular
area.

structural elements (nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, poly-
saccharides), metabolites (signaling molecules, toxins,
organic, and inorganic molecules), and molecules pro-
duced by coexisting hosts and structured by the sur-
rounding
environmental
conditions.
Therefore,
all
mobile genetic elements, such as phages, viruses, and
“relic” and extracellular DNA, should be included in the
term microbiome, but are not a part of microbiota (Fig.
2). Moreover, in this regard, it is important to consider
methodological aspects to differentiate DNA from living
organisms and their environment (see the chapter tech-
nical standards). The term microbiome is also some-
times confused with the metagenome. Metagenome is,
however, clearly defined as a collection of genomes and
genes from the members of a microbiota [25].
Microbiome studies sometimes focus on the behavior
of a specific group of microbiota (Fig. 2), generally in re-
lation to or justified by a clear hypothesis. Despite more
and more terms like “bacteriome,” “archaeome,” “myco-
biome,” or “virome” have started to appear in the scien-
tific literature, and these terms do not refer to biomes (a
regional ecosystem with a distinct assemblage of (micro)
organisms, and physical environment often reflecting a
certain climate and soil) as the microbiome itself. Conse-
quently, it would be better to use the original terms
(bacterial, archaeal, or fungal community). In contrast to
the microbiota, which can be studied separately, the
microbiome is always composed by all members, which
interact with each other, live in the same habitat, and
form
their
ecological
niche
together.
The
well-
established term “virome” is derived from “virus” and
“genome” and is used to describe viral shotgun metagen-
omes consisting of a collection of nucleic acids associ-
ated with a particular ecosystem or holobiont [56].
However, also here “viral metagenomes” can be sug-
gested as semantically and scientifically better terms.
There is also a question of at what resolution each of
the microbiome members should be studied. For eukary-
otes, in most cases, the “reproductive unit” is an ad-
equate level, where dynamics of organisms are measured
[57, 58], though the species definition continues to be
debated [59]. For prokaryotes, however, such a definition
based on reproduction does not exist: current species
definitions are based on DNA homologies between or-
ganisms such as the “more than 70% DNA-similarity” re-
vealed by DNA-DNA hybridization [58], or by the
average nucleotide identity as recommended by Goris
and colleagues [60]. Similarly to eukaryotes, the micro-
bial strains or ecotypes are the basis of taxonomy and
functionality. The stability of the defined strain is here,
the most critically discussed issue mostly due to the fre-
quent occurrence of horizontal gene transfer (HGT).
The latter is induced by the shift of the mobile genetic
elements such as plasmids, bacteriophages, and transpo-
sons from one strain to another, resulting in inevitable
genome changes and strongly affecting the strain stabil-
ity. Neglecting the strain level may, however, result in a
misinterpretation of the data due to essential functional
differences between microbial strains [61]. Defining eco-
logically
meaningful
populations
among
microbial
strains is important for identifying their roles in environ-
mental and host-associated microbiomes. Recently, a

novel metric of recent gene flow was introduced as a so-
lution, which identifies congruent genetic and ecological
units separated by strong gene flow discontinuities from
their next of kin [47].
Microbial networks and interactions
Microbes interact with one another, and these symbiotic
interactions have diverse consequences for microbial fit-
ness, population dynamics, and functional capacities
within the microbiome [62]. These interactions can ei-
ther be between microorganisms of the same species or
between different species, genera, families, and domains
of life. The interactive patterns within these webs may
be positive (mutualism, synergism, or commensalism),
negative (amensalism [including predation, parasitism,
antagonism, or competition]), or neutral—where there is
no (or no observed) effect on the functional capacities or
fitness of interacting species (Fig. 3a). Microbial life
strategy concepts (i.e., copio- and oligotrophic strategists
and
competitor–stress
tolerator–ruderals
framework)
can influence outcomes of interactions [63]. For ex-
ample, microorganisms competing for the same source
can also benefit from each other when competing for
the same compound at different trophic levels. Stability
of a complex microbial ecosystem depends on trophic
interactions for the same substrate at different concen-
tration levels. It is important to highlight that microbial
social adaptations in nature are so far understudied.
Here, molecular markers can provide insight into social
adaptations by supporting the theories, e.g., of altruists
and cheaters in native microbiomes [64].
Secondary metabolites play an essential role in mediat-
ing complex interspecies interactions and ensure survival
in competitive environments. Quorum sensing (QS)

associations between nodes. Green edges usually stay for positive interactions, while red edges visualize negative interactions between the
microorganisms. c Testing of the hypotheses resulted from the network analyses in relevant model systems is required for a comprehensive study
of microbial interactions

induced by small molecules like N-acyl-homoserine lac-
tones or peptides allows bacteria to control cooperative
activities and adapts their phenotypes to the biotic envir-
onment, resulting, e.g., in cell-cell adhesion or biofilm
formation [29, 65]. Direct Interspecies Electron Transfer
(DIET) is an important mechanism for communication
in most anaerobic ecosystems [66]. In addition, volatile
compounds can act as long-term messengers for cross-
kingdom
communication
over
long
distances
[67].
Moreover, the so-called “fungal highways” serve as trans-
portation systems for bacteria [68] as well as for water
and nutrients [69] and can therefore play an important
role in structuring microbial networks. Despite these ex-
amples,
communication
and
interaction
within
the
microbiome remain understudied and would profit from
more knowledge on the metabolic interplay of all micro-
biome members. Here, reductionist experimental models
and model microbiomes can help to identify microbes
and molecular mechanisms involved in complex interac-
tions [70].
Bioinformatic network and co-occurrence analyses
give an idea about the complexity of microbial inter-
action patterns [71, 72] but they are not suitable to un-
ravel the nature of these interactions (Fig. 3b). Despite
this limitation, analysis of microbial networks allows re-
searchers to identify hub species and explore the poten-
tial for diverse types of species interactions within the
microbiome. In microbial co-occurrence networks, hub
species are represented by nodes (Fig. 3b) that have
highest degree of connections with other species [72].
Co-occurrence analyses can be also applied at different
scales, e.g., co-occurrence patterns between ecosystems
at the community scale, modules of co-occurring micro-
organisms within communities, and co-occurring pairs
within modules that are nested within microbial com-
munities [73]. They can be linked to colonization resist-
ance, which determines the potential for allochthonous
microorganisms to invade the autochthonous commu-
nity, and can be considered as important tools for hy-
pothesis generation [4, 74, 75]. The existence of specific
types of microbial interactions and their consequences
for population dynamics or functions, however, require
testing in relevant model systems (Fig. 3c). Additionally,
technical approaches, such as cross feeding experiments
with
stable
isotopes
[75]
or
Fluorescence
in
situ
Hybridization and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy
(FISH-CLSM) combined with dual culture assays [76, 77],
are extremely useful for testing hypotheses generated
in silico.
Microbial interactions can be an important basis for
evolutionary
and
co-evolutionary
dynamics
within
microbiomes [78, 79]. Communication between micro-
bial community members gives rise to a complex land-
scape in which the fitness or function of a cell depends
not only on the genetic potential and chemical environ-
ment of a single cell, but also on the biotic environment
sensed [80, 81]. Hub species in networks are often hy-
pothesized to serve as keystone species, a concept which
has been transferred from macro-ecology into micro-
biome research [82]. Keystone species are suggested to
play a crucial role in diverse species interactions and to
have a greater impact on the performance and dynamics
of an ecosystem than other species [62]. However, hub
species within a co-association network do not necessar-
ily play a role as keystone species. The characterization
of the latter ones must additionally be confirmed and
complemented by adequate methods [83, 84]. Hub and
keystone taxa definitively need a better understanding of
their function in situ [85, 86]; in addition, they can be
integrated in computational methods to link micro- and
macroecological questions. If keystone species can be
considered as “indicator taxa”, another term, which have
been defined as those taxa that are highly indicative of a
particular experimental treatment or environmental con-
dition [87] is still unclear. The concept of indicator taxa
has gained much interest from the practical point of
view and was transferred from macroecology into micro-
biome research, and is now frequently used, e.g., in stud-
ies assessing the impact of agricultural practices on
microbiomes [88] or of diseases on the human micro-
biota [89]; as here, simple and highly standardized
qPCR-based approaches can be used for analysis.
Considering temporal and spatial changes of microbiota
The question of temporal and spatial structures in
microbiomes is important for understanding of micro-
biome functioning in general. It is also of great signifi-
cance for the understanding of specific processes, such
as outbreaks of pathogens in biotechnological and food
processing applications [90] as well as for predicting and
controlling microbiomes [17]. In general, the size-
diversity
relationship
initially
described
for
macro-
organisms was also evidenced for microbial communities
in various ecosystems [91, 92].
Temporal dynamics within the microbiome can be
assessed from the scale of seconds or minutes, reflecting
the timespan of messenger RNA to the scale of centuries
and millennia, during which microorganisms have coe-
volved with their host or within a particular environ-
ment [93]. Half-lives of bacterial mRNA depend on the
genes transcribed but is usually in the range of minutes,
while transcripts from archaeal genes are longer, and
times of several hours have been reported [93, 94]. Im-
portantly, although many authors in the past have linked
microbial activity with the rRNA content, recent studies
have indicated severe limitations of this concept, and
only mRNA can be considered as a reliable indicator of
the metabolic state [95]. Understanding the appropriate

dimension of study across this range of temporal scales
is critical for any microbiome manipulation, such as
therapeutic strategies in human microbiome research or
the use of biocontrol agents in the case of environmental
studies. Careful consideration of the specific characteris-
tics of the host of interest, such as circadian rhythms,
seasonal variations, or growth stages in relation to the
physiology of the host organism may help to identify op-
timal scales of assessment of temporal dynamics (Fig.
4a). Stegen et al. [17] suggest to consider three categor-
ies: (i) biotic and abiotic history, (ii) internal dynamics,
and (iii) external forcing factors as factors influencing
the temporal dynamics of microbiomes.
Most natural ecosystems are characterized by a high
degree of spatial structuring, which has been considered
to be important for many ecosystem services [96]. Con-
sidering spatial scale may imply comparison of microbial
patterns between distant regions, as well as the less obvi-
ous differentiation between the subsists of the same hab-
itats (Fig. 4b). Soils are primarily composed of micro-
aggregates (< 0.25 mm), which bind soil organic carbon
and protect it from removal by erosion and of macro-
aggregates (0.25 to 2 mm), which limit oxygen diffusion
and regulate water flow; each of the aggregates provides
a unique ecological niche, with its characteristic micro-
biome structure [97]. In fact, it has been suggested that
soils are the ecosystems with the most diverse compos-
ition of microbiota on Earth as a consequence of so
many different niches being present at small spatial
scales. A reduction of niches for instance, induced by
tillage in agricultural practices, can result in a loss in mi-
crobial diversity [98]. As plants and tillage influence the
development of soil structure to a large extent, a loss in
plant diversity has a strong impact on the biodiversity of
the soil microbiome too [99]. However, the answer to
the question of “chicken or egg” (do changes in the soil
microbiome induce shifts in the plant diversity or vice
versa?) remains unclear. The colonization of hosts by
microbiota is also not uniform. It is well known that, for
example, leaves harbour a different microbiota compared
to the root, and the root itself is heterogeneously colo-
nized by microbes, with different microbiota along the
length of the rhizosphere, and at the root surface vs. the
root interior [100]. Recently, the topic of the seed
Fig 4 Microbiome dynamics in time and scale. a Temporal dynamics of the microbiome is characterized by considering both the transient state
of microbiome as response to environmental perturbations, such as, for example, seasonal or circadian rhythms, and the resident state that
contains rather constant core microbiota. b Spatial dynamics of the microbiome is characterized by variations in the microbial composition
between similar habitats separated in space. The separation may be between the organisms (e.g., same plants species grown in two different
locations), between the parts of one organism (e.g., plant roots and the whole plant), or even within an organ (e.g., comparing microbiomes of
various intestinal segments)
Berg et al. Microbiome           (2020) 8:103

microbiota has attracted attention as a possible mode for
the vertical transmission of a core microbiota from one
plant generation to another [101]. Similar to plants, the
human body is not homogeneously colonized by mi-
crobes: each body compartment contains its own micro-
biota [102], and even microbiota from one body site may
differ depending on the area of sampling (e.g., the skin
microbiota [103]).
Microbial hotspots and hot moments are often closely
interlinked. For example, soils are characterized by the
existence of so-called microbial hotspots (spatial separ-
ation including the rhizosphere, drilosphere, or detritu-
sphere) and hot moments (temporal dynamics). In
hotspots, the fraction of actively metabolizing microor-
ganisms is 2–20 times higher than in the non-hotspots
[104], making temporal shifts in microbiome structure
and function in hotspots much more dynamic compared
to sites with less microbial activity.
Defining the core microbiota
Based on co-occurrence analyses and experimental data
capturing temporal and spatial dynamics of micro-
biomes, researchers have sought to define a core micro-
biota. This is indeed helpful as native microbiomes are
often highly complex, comprising thousands of species
across different kingdoms. Defining core microbiota can
facilitate discrimination of the stable and permanent
members of a microbiome from populations that may be
intermittent, associated only with specific microbiome
states, or restricted to specific environmental conditions.
A first suggestion was provided by Shade and Handels-
man [105], who defined a core microbiome as the suite
of members shared among microbial consortia from
similar habitats to identify the stable, consistent compo-
nents across complex microbial assemblages. Currently,
the core microbiota is mostly defined on the basis of
DNA sequences with taxonomic information. Taking the
resolution limits of DNA-based analyses (mainly ampli-
con sequencing of marker genes) into account, it is how-
ever
obvious
that
core
microbiomes
have
been
predominantly defined using genus-level discrimination
of a population, and strain-specific as well as functional
variation was not considered. As a contrast, Lemanceau
and coworkers [106] suggested a functional core micro-
biota that encompasses microbial vehicles carrying repli-
cators (genes) with essential functions for holobiont
fitness. Recently, Toju et al. [107] presented the concept
of the core microbiota specifically for managing agricul-
tural ecosystems into species-rich communities; they de-
fine the core as “sets of microorganisms that form cores
of interactions that can be used to optimize microbial
functions at the individual plant and ecosystem levels.”
Astudillo-García and coworkers [108] evaluated the
impact of different core microbiota definitions when
interrogating highly diverse microbial systems of marine
sponges. While caution must be exercised when defining
core communities, fortunately, overall results have ap-
peared to be relatively insensitive to variations in core
definitions. The transient microbiota changes over time,
depending on the environmental conditions, availability
of nutrition, and/or growth and health stage or even di-
urnal rhythms of hosts. In contrast, the “core” micro-
biota appears to remain fairly constant. In terms of
temporal dynamics, the core microbiota describes the
microbial community that is constantly associated with a
given host genotype or a specific environment (Fig. 4a).
Exceptions to this concept have also been described, e.g.,
in the microbiome optimally adapted to reoccurring hy-
dration/dehydration cycles, different bacterial communi-
ties fulfill different functions within the cycle: both
belong to the core [109]. Similarly, at a spatial scale, e.g.,
considering plants grown in the same field or in a range
of soils of one geographical region [110], the core micro-
biota does not change (Fig. 4b).
From functional predictions to the phenotype
Currently available methods for studying microbiomes,
so-called multi-omics, range from high throughput isola-
tion (culturomics) and visualization (microscopy), to tar-
geting the taxonomic composition (metabarcoding), or
addressing the metabolic potential (metabarcoding of
functional genes, metagenomics) to analyze microbial
activity (metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics, metabo-
lomics) (Fig. 5). Based on metagenome data, microbial
genomes can be reconstructed. While first metagenome-
assembled genomes were reconstructed from environ-
mental samples [111], in recent years, several thousands
of bacterial genomes were binned without culturing the
organisms behind. For example, 154,723 microbial ge-
nomes of the global human microbiome were recently
reconstructed from 9,428 metagenomes [112]. Our un-
derstanding, however, is still significantly limited due to
the missing links between the massive availability of
microbiome DNA sequence data on the one hand and
limited availability of microbial isolates needed to con-
firm metagenomic predictions of gene function on the
other hand. Metagenome data provides a playground for
new predictions, yet much more data is needed to
strengthen the links between sequence and rigorous
functional predictions. This becomes obvious when con-
sidering that the replacement of one single amino acid
residue by another may lead to a radical functional
change, resulting in an incorrect functional assignment
to a given gene sequence [113]. Additionally, cultivation
of new strains is needed to help identify the large frac-
tion of unknown sequences obtained from metage-
nomics analyses, which for poorly studied ecosystems
can be more than 70%. Depending on the applied
Berg et al. Microbiome           (2020) 8:103

----- Page 11 (native) -----
method, even in well-studied microbiomes, 40–70% of
the annotated genes in fully sequenced microbial ge-
nomes have no known or predicted function [114].
Moreover, current estimates predict that domains with
unknown functions will outnumber families of known
function very soon [115]. There is a clear need for more
classical microbiology including the use of targeted mu-
tants in combination with microbial biochemistry to
cope with this challenge. Moreover, there is much more
to gain from thorough functional characterization of
already discovered protein families with unknown func-
tion(s) than from further extending the list of these
families. While multiphasic approaches combining (ex-
tensive) cultivation and cultivation-independent analyses
have been state-of-the-art in environmental and plant
microbiology for a long time [116–118], this is not gen-
erally the case for medical microbiology. Recently, refer-
ence genomes and culture collections of the human gut
microbiota were established by high-throughput culturo-
mics [119–121].
Understanding
prokaryotic
functional
diversity
is
highly challenging, as 85 out of the currently established
118 phyla have not had a single species described to date
[121]. Finally, the number of prokaryotic phyla may
reach hundreds, and archaeal ones are among the least
studied. This issue needs to be addressed by gathering
meaningful taxonomic and functional information for
not-yet cultured prokaryotes [121]. The growing gap be-
tween the diversity of Bacteria and Archaea held in pure
culture and those detected by molecular methods has
led to the proposal to establish a formal nomenclature
for not-yet cultured taxa, primarily based on sequence
information [122, 123]. According to this proposal, the
concept of Candidatus species would be extended to the
groups of closely related genome sequences, and their
names would be published following established rules of
bacterial nomenclature. The suggested alterations of the
International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes raise
concerns regarding (1) the reliability and stability of no-
menclature, (2) the technological and conceptual limita-
tions as well as availability of reference genomes, (3) the
information content of in silico functional predictions,
and (4) the recognition of evolutionary units of microbial
diversity. These challenges need to be overcome to ar-
rive at a meaningful taxonomy of not-yet cultured pro-
karyotes with, at present, poorly understood phenotypes
[121]. Against this backdrop, significant efforts have
been made to cultivate bacteria from diverse environ-
ments. Staley and Konopka identified in 1985 “the great
plate count anomaly” which describes the fact that 90 to
99.9% of bacterial species cannot be grown under stand-
ard
laboratory
conditions
[124].
For
some
micro-
habitats, especially those with high nutrient content and
microbial
activity,
the
proportion
of
representative
strains available in culture relative to the molecular spe-
cies detected by sequencing grew from 35 to 65%, as it
was stated for the gut microbiota [125]. Similar advances
are needed for microbial populations from other natural
habitats as well as for the eukaryotic members of the
microbiome.

cells (microscopy, culturomics), followed by the DNA (single cell genomics, metabarcoding, metagenomics), RNA (metatranscriptomics), protein
(metaproteomics), and metabolites (metabolomics). In that order, the focus of the studies shifts from the microbial potential (learning about available
microbiota in the given habitat) over the metabolic potential (deciphering available genetic material) towards microbial functioning (e.g., the discovery
of the active metabolic pathways)

protozoa, fungi, and algae, can often be better cultivated
and microscopically studied; however, their phylogeny
and taxonomy are more complex and less studied. Inter-
estingly, primer-free 16S and 18S rRNA gene sequencing
from various environments has shown that among
microeukaryotes there is a huge number of previously
not detected taxa [126].
Apart from the in silico comparisons and cultivation
methods currently used, a set of isotope-probing tech-
niques is available to directly test functional hypotheses
within complex microbial communities. These methods
encompass DNA-, RNA-, protein-, and lipid-stable iso-
tope
probing
(SIP)
[127]
as
well
as
FISH-micro-
autoradiography,
FISH-NanoSIMS,
and
FISH-Raman
micro-spectroscopy, with the latter three methods offer-
ing single cell resolution [128, 129]. Recently, a micro-
fluidic Raman activated cell sorting (RACS) platform
was developed [130]. In a recent study, Lee and co-
workers allowed cells from mouse colon microbiota to
metabolize an unlabeled compound of interest (mucin)
in a presence of deuterated water [130]. Subsequently,
the deuterium labeled cells that actively metabolized
mucin were sorted out from the complex microbiomes
using the RACS platform and further analyzed by the
means of single-cell genomics and cultivation methods.
This method allows linking microbial metabolic pheno-
types to their genotypes in a novel cultivation-free way,
and so makes it possible to process from the microbial
potential directly to the microbial function (Fig. 5). Des-
pite its advancements, the throughput of this functional
sorting platform is still limited, and complementary
novel technological solutions such as the combination of
FISH and bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tag-
ging (BONCAT) [131] will contribute to the more ur-
gently required phenotype-centric studies in microbiome
research.
Host-microbe coevolution
The close relationships between hosts and their associ-
ated microorganisms gave rise to the theory of coevolu-
tion of the host and its associated microbiota [132, 133].
Coevolution is the reciprocal adaptation of lineages in
response to one another [134]. An example is the estab-
lishment of early land plants that was facilitated by sym-
biotic fungal associations, suggesting that plants have
coevolved with microbes since their first appearance on
land [135]. Another example are eukaryotes themselves;
mitochondria
and
plastids
are
organelles
within
eukaryotic cells that are derived from endosymbiotic
bacteria and that, throughout coevolution, have become
entirely dependent on their hosts and vice versa. Host-
microbe coevolution is important to consider in order to
facilitate a holistic understanding of the microbiota
[12, 136] (Fig. 6).
The
division
of
microorganisms
into
beneficial,
pathogenic, and neutral based on microbial interac-
tions with their hosts is a part of the widely cited
microbiome definition by Lederberg and McCray [42].
According to their interpretation, antagonistic coevo-
lution
includes
host-parasite
interactions,
while
mutualistic coevolution is present when positive inter-
actions prevail (Fig. 6). Such positive interactions may
evolve towards obligate symbioses, vertical inherit-
ance, and metabolic collaborations [137] (Fig. 6). Cat-
egorizing
pathogenic,
beneficial,
and
neutral
microorganisms according to their interaction with
their host may be useful for studies where microbe-
host interactions play a central role in mediating host
fitness, such as medical studies. The interpretation of
the pathogenicity data, however, should be taken with
caution [83]. Recent studies on opportunistic patho-
gens showed that host-microbe interactions depend
not only on the host, but also on the entire micro-
biome [138, 139]. Naturally disease-suppressive soils
suggest a similar situation for plants and many oppor-
tunistic soil-borne pathogens [23]. Furthermore, in
many environmental studies, there may be no specific
host available for extended periods of time, making
the division into pathogens and beneficials irrelevant.
Instead of looking into the interaction of one specific
microorganism with its host, one can consider the
holistic approach based on the holobiont theory (Fig.
6). Following this approach, the beneficial interplay of
the host and its microbiome is responsible for main-
taining the health of the holobiont, while diseases are
often correlated with microbial dysbiosis [20, 140].
Within this context of dysbiosis, the “pathobiome”
concept (Fig. 6), which represents the pathogenic
agent integrated within its biotic environment, was
established
and
applied
to
multiple
pathosystems
[141]. This approach suggests that microbial diversity
is a key factor in preventing diseases in plants [23] as
well as in the human gut [142]. Despite the numerous
studies, defining a “healthy microbiota”, the borders
between eubiosis and dysbiosis still remain a major
challenge for the future [20]. Another interesting in-
terpretation of microbial-host interactions is a so-
called “Anna Karenina principle” [143]. It states that
paralleling Leo Tolstoy’s dictum that “all happy fam-
ilies look alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its
own way,” dysbiotic individuals vary more in micro-
bial community composition than healthy individuals.
For example, the microbiomes of healthy corals were
found to be more uniform than those of diseased
corals [143]. Similarly, a very recent study found that
community composition and immune responses are
significantly less stable in individuals with inflamma-
tory bowel disease than in healthy individuals [144].

Evolutionary processes and selection pressures significantly
drive host-microbe interactions; therefore, differentiation into
man-made, anthropocentric categories can change over time.
One example is Helicobacter pylori that was the dominant
microbe in the stomachs of almost all people in the early
twentieth century and almost disappeared in just 100 years
[22]. H. pylori is on one hand a risk factor for peptic ulcers
and stomach cancer; the loss of this bacterium, on the other
hand, is associated with asthma, hay fever, or skin allergies in
childhood [145]. Another example of the complex evolution-
ary interactions between microbes and their prospective
hosts is the emergence of pathogens like Stenotrophomonas
maltophilia, a bacterium of plant-associated origin that is
indistinguishable from the global opportunistic human-
pathogenic strain [139, 146]. Altogether, natural selection is
perceived to favor hosts that shape the community compos-
ition to promote a beneficial host-microbe symbiosis [147],
yet many factors can unbalance this dynamic to induce selec-
tion for pathogenic or antagonistic microbes within the host
microbiome. Based on computational models, Lewin-Epstein
et al. [148] suggested that microbes that manipulate
their hosts to act altruistically could be favored by se-
lection and may play a role in the widespread occurrence
of altruism.
Host-microbe coevolution leads to specific micro-
biomes associated with plants and animals [139, 149].
The extent of this specificity is influenced by many fac-
tors and varies between the phylogenetic branches. For
mosses, which represent the oldest land plants on Earth,
an extraordinarily high degree of plant specificity was
described. This specificity was independent from geo-
graphical origin of the host and was vertically transmit-
ted from the sporophyte to the gametophyte and vice
versa [150, 151]. Domestication and breeding activities
can also significantly shape host microbiomes and in
some cases to a stronger extent than expected [152].
The theory of the disappearing microbiota suggests that
prevalent chronic diseases are caused by the anthropo-
genic microbiome shifts towards reduced diversity [22].
Considering this, it is important to reconsider our activ-
ities (e.g., “overcleaning” of home environments) and
evaluate crop management approaches, such as breeding
strategies, to avoid the loss of co-evolved beneficial host-
microbe interactions.
Technical Standards in Microbiome Research
In the face of the pronounced and ongoing technical ad-
vances in microbiology over the last decade, the research
Fig. 6 A shift in the understanding of the microbial-host coevolution from the “separation” theories to the holistic approach. The hosts and their
associated microbiota are assumed to have coevolved with each other, whereby different approaches are considered to describe the coevolution
theory. According to the “separation” approach (upper part of the figure), the microorganisms can be divided into pathogens, neutral, and symbionts,
depending on their interaction with their host. The coevolution between host and its associated microbiota may be accordingly described as
antagonistic (based on negative interactions) or mutualistic (based on positive interactions). The recent emerge in publications about opportunistic
pathogens and pathobionts gave a shift towards holistic approach in the coevolutions theory (lower part of the figure). The holistic approach sees the
host and its associated microbiota as one unit (so-called holobiont), that coevolves as one entity. According to the holistic approach, holobiont’s
disease state is linked to dysbiosis, low diversity of the associated microbiota, and their variability: a so-called “pathobiome” state. The healthy state, on
the other hand, is accompanied with eubiosis, high diversity, and uniformity of the respective microbiota. The dynamic flow of microorganisms from
one host to another and to the environment, described by the One Health concept, underpins the holistic approach in the coevolution

community has failed to set consistent standards for
microbiome research. This has resulted in many draw-
backs,
including
missing
possibilities
for
cross-
comparison of data between labs or the implementation
of data generated with “old” technologies in more recent
studies.
A large amount of publications is available that show
bias in DNA extraction and processing procedures for
subsequent analysis of microbiomes [153]. The use of a
defined mock community can on the one hand help to
determine the best possible extraction method and on
the other hand serve as an internal control to estimate
the possible bias throughout the workflow and analysis.
However, even the implementation of mock communi-
ties into the analysis cannot solve all issues, which intro-
duce a bias into the molecular analysis of microbiomes
form environmental samples. For example, natural sorp-
tion processes of soil microorganisms to soil particles
cannot be mirrored by the application of mock commu-
nities to soil. Further, up to 80% of the extracted DNA
in complex habitats like soils can contain relic DNA
(extracellular DNA from the dead cells as well as ex-
creted DNA from living cells). Such relic DNA can in-
flate the observed prokaryotic and fungal diversity and
cause inaccurate estimation of taxon relative abundances
[53]. A possible solution was presented by Nocker et al.
[154] by using popidium monoazide (PMA) which only
penetrates membrane-damaged cells, where a photo-
induced azide group covalently binds to DNA; this
cross-linking effectively inhibits PCR amplification of
DNA from dead cells of both Gram-negative and Gram-
positive bacteria. This procedure was successfully ap-
plied in microbiome studies, especially those with low
microbial abundance and activity [155, 156], but it is not
a standard yet. A well-known example in DNA process-
ing is the selective amplification induced by primer se-
lection and PCR or the large number of unknown reads
when metagenomes are analyzed [152, 157, 158]. A
primer-free rRNA gene sequencing approach developed
by Karst et al. [126] facilitated the discovery of unknown
microbial diversity. The authors suggest to combine
poly(A)-tailing and reverse transcription of SSU rRNA
molecules with synthetic long-read sequencing. Using
this approach, they were able to generate high-quality,
full-length SSU rRNA sequences, without primer bias, at
high throughput and observed a large proportion of so
far undescribed diversity in their study [126].
Bioinformatics analysis of obtained sequence data is
neither
standardized
nor
biases
that
are
clearly
expressed. For performing the data evaluations of 16S
rRNA gene sequences, free software solutions and well-
working forums like Qiime2 [159] and Mothur [160] are
available. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) are used
for long time to analyze high-throughput barcoding, e.g.,
using marker-genes like 16S rRNA and or the ITS region
for high throughput sequencing data. In addition, ampli-
con sequence variants (ASVs) can be used that based on
exactly resolved, down to the level of single-nucleotide
differences over the sequenced gene region. Benefits of
finer resolution are immediately apparent, and the status
of ASVs as consistent labels with intrinsic biological
meaning identified independently from a reference data-
base [154]. The improvements in reusability, reproduci-
bility, and comprehensiveness are sufficiently great so
that ASVs could replace OTUs as the standard unit of
marker-gene analysis and reporting [161]. Several studies
and joint projects have been performed to compare dif-
ferent tools and pipelines, showing significant differences
in outcome depending on the tool or pipeline and the
settings used [162–165]. It is obvious that besides suffi-
cient sequencing depth, the choice of database for anno-
tation of reads has a strong influence on the outcome.
Moreover, the choice of parameters such as cutoff
values, filtering of chimeras, and other, which is often
done automatically, has a strong influence on the out-
come. For example, as a result of data evaluation
methods allowing investigation of taxa with a represen-
tation of more than 1% only, rare taxa are often
neglected [166]. Such rare taxa, however, constitute up
to 28% of all microbes, can represent key players in
some habitats, and may be of importance for structuring
communities [167]. They can have an over-proportional
role in biogeochemical cycles and may be a hidden
driver of microbiome function [168–170]. Moreover, mi-
croorganisms carrying antibiotic resistance genes often
belong to the rare taxa in native microbiomes; under
stress conditions, they provide the insurance for health
and survival and ensure the plasticity of the ecosystem
[171]. However, in the animal and human gut micro-
biome, these aspects can be crucial for outbreaks and
therapies and are therefore implemented in the WHO
forecast of spread in antibiotic resistance. Here, also,
computing resources are still an issue making bioinfor-
matics the bottleneck of microbiome analysis. Ten Hoo-
pen and colleagues described that, for example, the
subset of the TARA Oceans Microbiome Project that
has been size-fractioned for prokaryotes comprises 135
samples. For the analysis of these samples, 248 runs con-
taining 28.8 billion reads with an analysis output repre-
senting
about
10 TB
of
data
were
necessary.
The
extensive study resulted in 23.2 billion predicted protein
coding sequences [172]. In an attempt to deal with such
big data, several global microbiome projects such as
Human Microbiome Project [44] and Earth Microbiome
Project [173] emerged in the past 10 years.
Further large gaps in metadata that limit microbiome
analysis by impeding the comparability and integrative
analysis of studies are obvious. There are indeed some

repositories for data, e.g., the sequence read archive SRA
(NCBI [174]), the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA
[175]), or the CNGB Nucleotide Sequence Archive
(CNSA [176]). However, in many cases, data are “avail-
able on request” only, which contradicts Findable, Ac-
cessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) principles
[177]. Even if data are available, the metadata often lack
important information and are not reviewed sufficiently
by the repositories including information on the experi-
mental and statistical design of a study. Schloss and col-
leagues
published
a
comprehensive
review,
about
identification and overcoming threats to reproducibility,
replicability, robustness, and generalizability in micro-
biome research [178]. Thus, there is an urgent need of
standardization and the development of platforms for
correct and comprehensive metadata repositories, as
shown by Proctor [2] who developed a Project and Sam-
ple Application Standard for Human Pathogen/Vector
Genomic Sequences. Ten Hoopen and colleagues [172]
described a well-designed strategy that allows to set and
apply standards and to get comparable and reusable data
from microbiome research, following the FAIR principle.
Future perspectives and challenges for
microbiome research
The increasing availability of microbiome data driven by
advances in -omics technologies has led to dramatic in-
creases in our understanding of the potential for micro-
biomes to enhance productivity and sustainability of
diverse systems [6, 179, 180]. The grand vision of applied
microbiome research is to improve health of humans,
animals, plants, and whole ecosystems. In general, micro-
biomes can be managed either directly by applying (i)
microbiome transplants, (ii) microbes with beneficial
properties, or (iii) microbiota-active metabolites, or indir-
ectly by changing environmental conditions in a way that
microbiomes also shift their structure and function from
dysbiosis into a healthy state [180, 181]. When comparing
microbiome-based applications across humans, animals,
and cropping systems, a striking synergy is visible (Fig. 7).
Although the respective fields are not yet well connected,
a consistent trend has become evident in all areas. This
trend involves a focus on tailored treatments, such as for
example, “next-generation” precision farming or personal-
ized medicine (Fig. 7). This concept recognizes that not all
individual hosts and their associated indigenous micro-
biomes will respond in the same way to a particular
introduced microbe, microbiome transplant, or metabol-
ite. Instead, it relies upon fundamental understanding of
those particular host-microbe, environment-microbe, and
microbe-microbe interactions that mediate microbiome
assembly and functional capacities across diverse settings.
Stegen et al. [17] suggest in their conceptual framework
for microbiome management greater crosstalk across dif-
ferent areas, e.g., leveraging-specific ecological concepts
from
environmental
microbiome
science
to
guide
optimization of strategies to manipulate human micro-
biomes towards improved health.
The human microbiome is emerging as a key target of
personalized medicine by offering interesting solutions
for a variety of environmental and metabolic diseases
[182, 183]. In this respect, the human microbiome not

precision treatment in all areas of microbiome research, such as agriculture, human and animal medicine, and bioeconomy, while the
interconnection between these areas by the means of the cycling of subsets of microbial communities is an underlying concept behind the One
Health approach. The synergies between the microbiome applications in the areas of medicine (left) and agriculture (right) are shown with the

only contributes to inter-individual variability in all as-
pects of a disease, but also represents a potential target
for management, which could be modulated by thera-
peutics, dietary changes, the use of pre-, pro- or synbio-
tics, life biotherapeutic products corresponding to given
species or mix of species (synthetic microbiota), and
microbiome transplants [184–187]. Fecal microbiota
transplantation is an approved treatment against recur-
rent and refractory Clostridioides difficile infection [188,
189] in the USA. Despite the mechanisms behind its effi-
cacy that remain largely unknown, its applications in re-
cent years rapidly expanded beyond gastrointestinal
disorders to multiple fields such as a potential therapy
for obesity, metabolic syndrome, and liver diseases
[190–192]. Microbial heterogeneity between humans
and across spatial and temporal gradients requires multi-
dimensional datasets and a unifying set of theories and
statistical tools to analyze the human microbiome and
fully realize the potential for microbiome-based thera-
peutics [193]. Overall, the importance of a healthy gut
microbiome is also highlighted by the recently described
gut—brain, gut-liver, and gut—lung axis, making the gut
a central organ for human health [194–196].
In analogy, the plant microbiome was identified as a
key for the next green revolution (Science Breakthroughs
by 2030 [197]). A systems approach integrating plant
breeding, precision farming, agricultural management,
and microbiome research provides a powerful strategy
for improving sustainable crop production in a changing
world [7, 148, 198]. Such an approach that encompasses
many biological and geophysical components that may
affect a plant's production in a specific environment was
established by an interdisciplinary team as “Phytobiomes
Roadmap” [199]. The species- and habitat-specific plant
microbiota contributes multiple aspects to the function-
ing of the plant holobiont, such as (i) seed germination
and growth, (ii) nutrient supply, (iii) resistance against
biotic and abiotic stress factors, and (iv) production of
bioactive metabolites [4]. Due to its importance for crop
health, the plant microbiome has been studied for a long
time. Moreover, an extensive list of microbiome man-
agement strategies and products was developed in agri-
culture including (i) microbiome transplants (straw dung
and biodynamic additives), (ii) microbial inoculants, (iii)
microbial and plant extracts, and (iv) methods to change
environmental conditions [181]. In the last decades,
management-intensive agriculture has relied predomin-
antly on synthetic chemicals and has resulted in serious
environmental and health problems as well as biodiver-
sity losses [200]. Research on plant microbiomes, on the
other hand, will support targeted and predictive manage-
ment approaches that are suited to the specific condi-
tions of the field and can thus result in greater
sustainability. Similar to the human gut microbiome, the
seed/rhizosphere microbiome is crucial for the plant,
and the seed is a perfect target for next-generation mi-
crobials [100, 201]. Pérez-Jaramillo and colleagues [152]
proposed the “back to the roots” approach for seeds,
which offers an interesting opportunity for unraveling
the seed microbiomes of wild relatives and ancient heir-
loom breeds of crop cultivars to save beneficial seed
microbiomes for agriculture. Harnessing seed micro-
biomes of wild relatives of crop plants or from promis-
ing biological resources potentially enables a matching
symbiosis between the plant and its specific seed micro-
biota [202]. The post-harvest microbiota is closely linked
with our food microbiota, which can also be managed
for desired functional properties of food products re-
garding, safety and preservation issues, organoleptic, or
health
properties.
This
represents
a
relative
yet
unexplored microbiome-based application that is bene-
fiting of the emerging amount of data on food ecosys-
tems [203].
The importance of microbiomes goes beyond the
health of individual hosts. Microbes from different hosts
and ecosystems can strongly interact and influence one
other [204, 205]. These observations have led to the slo-
gan “A healthy environment promotes healthy humans”
which endorsed the “One Health concept.” According to
the World Health Organization, “One Health” is an ap-
proach designing and implementing programs, policies,
legislation, and research in which multiple sectors com-
municate and work together to achieve better public
health outcomes. An expansion of the One Health con-
cept including environmental health and its relation to
human cultures and habits suggests that the lifestyle-
microbiota-human health connection should be taken
into account in societal decisions and policy making
[206] (Fig. 7). For example, urbanization is associated
with increases in allergies, asthma, and other chronic
diseases. Besides, overall pollution pattern, a significant
loss of microbial diversity, has been observed in urban
areas, which has been associated with disease develop-
ment [206]. Dominguez-Bello et al. [16] suggest that
changes in the human microbiota occurring concomi-
tantly with industrialization may be the underlying factor
dramatic increases in metabolic, immune, and cognitive
diseases, including obesity, diabetes, asthma, allergies, in-
flammatory bowel disease, and autism in the “developed”
world. The loss of diversity in turn is correlated with an
increase
in
bacterial
resistance
against
antibiotics,
thereby indicating a need for implementing strategies to
restore bacterial diversity in built environments [156].
Understanding the complex connections among micro-
biomes across diverse hosts and habitats and their rela-
tionships with the health of the humans, animals, and
plants, opens the potential for innovative and holistic ap-
proaches
to
diagnosis,
treatment,
and
intervention

within the context of the One Health concept [3, 23,
197, 206]. In analogy to One Health, different concepts
exist linking human with environmental health; the
planetary health concept is the most popular one [207].
This topic is also acknowledged in a number of national
and international strategies for bioeconomy, where a
sustainable, biological production of goods meets the de-
mands of the economy. Without doubt to make these
concepts a story of success, it requires interlinked strat-
egies not only between different disciplines of natural
science but beyond and integration of social sciences as
well as stakeholders.
However, what we are facing nowadays is often the op-
posite: biodiversity loss, pollution, ozone depletion, cli-
mate change, and crossing of biogeochemical cycle
boundary are the anthropogenic factors characterizing our
epoch, the Anthropocene. The Antropocene is also
reflected in the planetary boundary concept [208]. Four of
nine planetary boundaries have now been crossed as a re-
sult of human activity: climate change, loss of biosphere
integrity, land-system change, and altered biogeochemical
cycles. First, studies indicate that they change functional
and genetic diversity of the entire microbiota; however,
more knowledge on the impact of these anthropogenic
factors on different microbiomes and their consequences
for our planet is definitively necessary [11]. Here, we
recognize urgent need for more research, especially on en-
vironmental microbiomes and mechanistic insights in
anthropogenic-driven changes. Understanding marine and
terrestrial microbiomes and their interplay could be de-
finitively a key to finding solutions for these massive chal-
lenges associated with the Antropocene. Microbiome
management and the development of high-potential
microbiome-based innovations are promising for various
application fields but should go along with the careful as-
sessment of the putative environmental impact of these
new and promising technologies.
Conclusions
Based on the recent advances in the area, we suggest the
revival of the original definition of the microbiome term
suggested by Whipps et al. [40]. The definition, which
contains all important points that are valid even 30 years
after its publication in 1988, was extended by two ex-
planatory sentences differentiating the terms micro-
biome and microbiota and pronouncing its dynamic
character.
The microbiome is defined as a characteristic micro-
bial community occupying a reasonable well-defined
habitat which has distinct physio-chemical properties.
The microbiome not only refers to the microorganisms
involved but also encompass their theatre of activity,
which results in the formation of specific ecological
niches. The microbiome, which forms a dynamic and
interactive micro-ecosystem prone to change in time
and scale, is integrated in macro-ecosystems including
eukaryotic hosts, and here crucial for their functioning
and health.
The microbiota consists of the assembly of microor-
ganisms belonging to different kingdoms (Prokaryotes
[Bacteria, Archaea], Eukaryotes [e.g., Protozoa, Fungi,
and Algae]), while “their theatre of activity” includes mi-
crobial structures, metabolites, mobile genetic elements
(e.g., transposons, phages, and viruses), and relic DNA
embedded
in
the
environmental
conditions
of
the
habitat.
Furthermore, we consider the following points as cru-
cial for microbiome studies:
1. The core microbiota is a suite of members shared
among microbial consortia from similar habitats,
which is important for understanding stability,
plasticity, and functioning across complex microbial
assemblages.
2. Theories adapted from macro-ecology might be
helpful to understand patterns of microbiome dy-
namics in different environments, but their general
application needs to be verified.
3. An appropriate experimental, methodological, and
statistical design is the basis for each microbiome
study. The spatial, temporal, and developmental
integration should be implemented in the design by
(i) choosing the appropriate sampling frequencies
based on the system characteristic in order to
capture complete core and transient microbiota, (ii)
considering the appropriate spatial scale of the
system by recognizing that also subsets on scales
are relevant for microbiota assessment, and (iii) for
strongly dynamic systems, investigation of a space-
time continuum of the microbial distribution in-
stead of capturing one particular moment/space
unit should be considered.
4. Microbiome research is strongly driven by
methodological advances. Despite all progress in
this area, there is no perfect and universal method.
A toolbox of technologies will reduce bias resulting
from each individual technology and result in a
more complete view on the biological system as a
whole.
5. Microbial functions play an important role in the
ecosystem. Therefore, we recommend including a
combination of several currently available methods
in microbiome studies that allow deeper insights
into microbial functioning.
6. Despite large amounts of –omics data, produced in
the last decade, we still lack information on the
organisms behind. Thus, strong efforts are needed
for implementing more cultivation-based

approaches into microbiome research, which allows
a description of ecotypes and modes of adaptation
of specific microbial groups to their environments.
7. Microbial interactions are the basis for functioning
and evolutionary dynamics of microbial
communities. Therefore, we advocate considering
interactions in the study design.
8. Host-microbe interactions shape the reciprocal
fitness, phenotype, and metabolisms, giving raise to
the theory of coevolution of microbiota and their
host [209]. We suggest a holistic approach based on
the hologenome theory of evolution. Disease state
of the holobiont is characterized by dysbiosis
(pathobiome), while eubiosis refers to a balanced
host-microbe interaction (“healthy” microbiome).
9. The division of microorganisms into beneficial,
pathogenic, and neutral according to microbial
interactions with their hosts is based on an
anthropocentric view [210]. Indeed, the physiology
of the host and the whole microbiome substantially
influence the outcome of the interaction.
Application of these clarifications and recommenda-
tions should assist researchers in designing their micro-
biome studies in a holistic way, which will help to
develop microbial models and predictions, which in turn
will accelerate our ability to design applications in in all
areas of life.
