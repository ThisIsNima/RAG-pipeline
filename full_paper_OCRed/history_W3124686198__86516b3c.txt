ABSTRACT1:   
Online feedback mechanisms harness the bi-directional communication capabilities of the 
Internet in order to engineer large-scale word-of-mouth networks. Best known so far as a 
technology for building trust and fostering cooperation in online marketplaces, such as eBay, 
these mechanisms are poised to have a much wider impact on organizations. Their growing 
popularity has potentially important implications for a wide range of management activities, such 
as brand building, customer acquisition and retention, product development, and quality 
assurance. This paper surveys our progress in understanding the new possibilities and challenges 
that these mechanisms represent. It discusses some important dimensions in which Internet-based 
feedback mechanisms differ from traditional word-of-mouth networks and surveys the most 
important issues related to their design, evaluation, and use. It provides an overview of relevant 
work in game theory and economics on the topic of reputation. It discusses how this body of 
work is being extended and combined with insights from computer science, management 
science, sociology, and psychology in order to take into consideration the special properties of 
online environments. Finally, it identifies opportunities that this new area presents for OR/MS 
research.

INTRODUCTION 
One of the most important new capabilities of the Internet relative to previous mass 
communication technologies is its bi-directionality. Through the Internet, not only can 
organizations reach audiences of unprecedented scale at a low cost, but also, for the first time in 
human history, individuals can make their personal thoughts, reactions, and opinions easily 
accessible to the global community of Internet users. 
Word-of-mouth, one of the most ancient mechanisms in the history of human society, is being 
given new significance by this unique property of the Internet. Online feedback mechanisms, also 
known as reputation systems (Resnick et al., 2000), are using the Internet's bi-directional 
communication capabilities in order to artificially engineer large-scale word-of-mouth networks 
in which individuals share opinions and experiences on a wide range of topics, including 
companies, products, services, and even world events. Table 1 lists several noteworthy examples 
of such mechanisms in use today. 
Perhaps the best-known application of online feedback mechanisms to date has been their use as 
a technology for building trust in electronic markets. This has been motivated by the fact that 
many traditional trust-building mechanisms, such as state-enforced contractual guarantees, tend 
to be less effective in large-scale online environments (Kollock 1999). Online feedback 
mechanisms have emerged as a viable mechanism for fostering cooperation among strangers in 
such settings by ensuring that the behavior of a trader towards any other trader becomes publicly 
known and may therefore affect the behavior of the entire community towards that trader in the 
future. Knowing this, traders have an incentive to behave well towards each other, even if their 
relationship is a one-time deal. As I discuss in Section 3, a growing body of empirical evidence 
seems to demonstrate that these systems have managed to provide remarkable stability in 
otherwise very risky trading environments.

The application of feedback mechanisms in online marketplaces is particularly interesting 
because many of these marketplaces would probably not have come into existence without them. 
It is, however, by no means the only possible application domain of such systems. Internet-based 
feedback mechanisms are appearing in a surprising variety of settings. For example, 
Epinions.com encourages Internet users to rate practically any kind of brick-and-mortar business, 
such as airlines, telephone companies, resorts, etc. Moviefone.com solicits and displays user 
feedback on new movies alongside professional reviews, and Citysearch.com does the same for 
restaurants, bars and performances. Even news sites, perhaps the best embodiment of the 
unidirectional mass media of the previous century, are now soliciting and publishing reader 
feedback on world events alongside professionally written news articles (see, for example, 
BBC’s Talking Point web forum.)  
The proliferation of online feedback mechanisms is already changing people’s behavior in subtle 
but important ways. Anecdotal evidence suggests that people now increasingly rely on opinions 
posted on such systems in order to make a variety of decisions ranging from what movie to 
watch to what stocks to invest on (Guernsey, 2000). Only five years ago the same people would 
primarily base those decisions on advertisements or professional advice.  
Such trends have important repercussions for OR/MS. Managers of today’s networked 
organizations need to understand how the growing popularity of large-scale online feedback 
mechanisms affects a wide range of activities within their organizations. Some examples include: 
• Brand building and customer acquisition. Online feedback mechanisms can serve as a low-
cost and, potentially, very effective channel for acquiring and retaining customers, 
complementary to advertising (Mayzlin, 2003). At the same time they quickly disseminate 
bad news that can potentially harm brand equity. 
• Product development and quality control. Online feedback networks can assist an 
organization better understand consumer reactions to its current product line. At the same 
time, they reveal this information to competitors and they also accelerate the dissemination of 
information about product defects.

----- Page 6 (native) -----

• Supply chain quality assurance. Industry-wide feedback mechanisms can assist organizations 
better assess prospective first-time suppliers; they can also act as a powerful disciplining 
mechanism that ensures fulfillment of contractual obligations and can potentially lower the 
legal costs of doing business. 
There is currently very little work studying these and other related possibilities. The rising 
importance of online feedback mechanisms, thus, not only invites, but also necessitates rigorous 
OR/MS research on their functioning and consequences. How do such mechanisms affect the 
behavior of participants in the communities where they are introduced? To what extent can their 
operators and participants manipulate them? How can communities protect themselves from such 
potential abuse? What mechanism designs work best in what settings? This is just a small subset 
of questions that invite exciting and valuable research. 
The traditional tools of OR/MS can be of value in tackling these questions. In common with 
other Internet technologies, however, online feedback mechanisms intensify the 
interdependencies between organizations, their customers, their partners, and their competitors. 
Managers will therefore find that proper decision-making related to the implementation and use 
of feedback mechanisms requires careful consideration, not only of their own actions, but also of 
the likely responses of other players interconnected through them. Accordingly, the tools of 
game theory play a prominent role in the study of these mechanisms2. 
This paper surveys our progress so far in understanding the new possibilities and challenges that 
these mechanisms represent. Section 2 discusses some important dimensions in which Internet-
based feedback mechanisms differ from traditional word-of-mouth networks. Section 3 presents 
an overview of eBay’s feedback mechanism, perhaps the best-studied online feedback 
mechanism to date. It summarizes initial field evidence on the mechanism’s properties and 
formulates the most important open questions relating to designing, evaluating and using such 
mechanisms. The next two sections survey our progress in developing a systematic discipline 
that can help answer those questions. First, Section 4 provides an overview of relevant past work

in game theory and economics. Section 5 then discusses how this stylized body of work is being 
extended in order to take into consideration the special properties of online environments. 
Finally, Section 6 summarizes the main points of the paper and discusses the opportunities that 
this new area presents for OR/MS research.

ONLINE FEEDBACK MECHANISMS: AN ANCIENT CONCEPT IN A MODERN SETTING 
Word-of-mouth networks constitute an ancient solution to a timeless problem of social 
organization: the elicitation of good conduct in communities of self-interested individuals who 
have short-term incentives to cheat one another. The historical appeal of these networks has been 
their power to induce cooperation without the need for costly enforcement institutions. Before 
the establishment of formal law and centralized systems of contract enforcement backed by the 
sovereign power of a state, most ancient and medieval communities relied on word-of-mouth as 
the primary enabler of economic and social activity (Benson, 1989; Greif, 1993; Milgrom, North 
and Weingast, 1990).  Many aspects of social and economic life still do so today (Klein, 1997). 
What makes online feedback mechanisms different from the word-of-mouth networks of the past 
is the combination of (a) their unprecedented scale, achieved through the exploitation of the 
Internet’s low-cost, bi-directional communication capabilities, (b) the ability of their designers to 
precisely control and monitor their operation through the introduction of automated feedback 
mediators, and (c) new challenges introduced by the unique properties of online interaction, such 
as the volatile nature of online identities and the almost complete absence of contextual cues that 
would facilitate the interpretation of what is, essentially, subjective information. 
Scale enables new applications. Scale is essential to the effectiveness of word-of-mouth 
networks. In an online marketplace, for example, sellers care about buyer feedback primarily to 
the extent that they believe that it might affect their future profits; this can only happen if 
feedback is provided by a sufficient number of current customers and communicated to a 
significant portion of future prospects. Theory predicts that a minimum degree of participation in 
word-of-mouth communities is required before reputation effects can induce any cooperation. 
Once this threshold is reached, however, the power of reputation immediately springs to life and 
high levels of cooperation emerge in a discontinuous fashion (Bakos and Dellarocas, 2002).

----- Page 8 (native) -----

Therefore, the vastly increased scale of Internet-based feedback mechanisms is likely to render 
them powerful institutions in environments where traditional word-of-mouth networks were 
heretofore considered ineffective devices. The social, economic and perhaps even political 
consequences of such a trend deserve careful study. 
Information technology enables systematic design. In pre-Internet societies word of mouth 
emerged naturally and evolved in ways that were difficult to control or model. The Internet 
allows this powerful social force to be precisely measured and controlled through proper 
engineering of the information systems that mediate online feedback communities. Such 
automated feedback mediators specify who can participate, what type of information is solicited 
from participants, how it is aggregated and what type of information is made available to them 
about other community members. Through the proper design of these mediators, mechanism 
designers can exercise precise control over a number of parameters that are very difficult or 
impossible to influence in brick-and-mortar settings. For example, feedback mediators can 
replace detailed feedback histories with a wide variety of summary statistics; they can apply 
filtering algorithms to eliminate outlier or suspect ratings; they can weight ratings according to 
some measure of the rater’s trustworthiness, etc. Such degree of control can impact the resulting 
social outcomes in non-trivial ways (see Sections 5.2-5.4). Through the use of information 
technology, what had traditionally fallen within the realm of the social sciences is, to a large 
extent, being transformed to an engineering design problem. Understanding the full space of 
design possibilities and the impacts of specific design choices on the resulting social outcomes is 
an important research challenge introduced by these new systems. 
Online interaction introduces new challenges. The disembodied nature of online environments 
introduces several challenges related to the interpretation and use of online feedback. Some of 
these challenges have their roots in the subjective nature of feedback information. Brick-and-
mortar settings usually provide a wealth of contextual cues that assist in the proper interpretation 
of opinions and gossip (such as familiarity with the person who acts as the source of that 
information, the ability to draw inferences from the source’s facial expression or mode of dress, 
etc.). Most of these cues are absent from online settings. Readers of online feedback are thus 
faced with the task of evaluating the opinions of complete strangers. Other challenges to 
feedback interpretation have their root in the ease with which online identities can be changed.

----- Page 9 (native) -----

This opens the door to various forms of strategic manipulation. For example, community 
members can build a good reputation, milk it by cheating other members and then disappear and 
reappear under a new online identity and a clean record (Friedman and Resnick, 2001). They can 
use fake online identities to post dishonest feedback and thus try to inflate their reputation or 
tarnish that of their competitors (Dellarocas, 2000). Finally, the mediated nature of online 
feedback mechanisms raises questions related to the trustworthiness of their operators. An 
important prerequisite for the widespread acceptance of online feedback mechanisms is, 
therefore, a better understanding of how such systems can be compromised, as well as the 
development of adequate defenses.

A CASE STUDY: EBAY’S FEEDBACK MECHANISM 
eBay’s feedback mechanism is, arguably, the best-studied online feedback mechanism to date. 
This section summarizes initial field evidence on the mechanism’s properties and motivates the 
need for a systematic discipline of online feedback mechanism design and evaluation. 
Founded in September 1995, eBay is the leading online marketplace for the sale of goods and 
services by a diverse community of individuals and businesses. At the beginning of 2003 the 
eBay community numbered 49.7 million registered users, and was the most popular shopping 
site on the Internet when measured by total user minutes3.  
One of the most remarkable aspects of eBay is that the transactions performed through it are not 
backed up by formal contractual guarantees. Instead, cooperation and trust are primarily based 
on the existence of a simple feedback mechanism. This mechanism allows eBay buyers and 
sellers to rate one another following transactions and makes the history of a trader’s past ratings 
public to the entire community. For an overview of eBay’s feedback mechanism the reader is 
referred to (Resnick and Zeckhauser, 2002). 
Summary of empirical evidence 
eBay’s impressive commercial success seems to indicate that its feedback mechanism has 
succeeded in achieving its primary objective: generate sufficient trust among buyers to persuade

them to assume the risk of transacting with complete strangers (Ba and Pavlou, 2002). Since 
sufficiently does not necessarily mean efficiently, eBay’s success has generated substantial 
interest in better understanding how its feedback mechanism works, how much it contributes to 
its success, and how its success can be replicated in other environments.  
A first set of results comes from empirical studies. Even a surface analysis of a representative 
eBay data set can uncover some interesting properties (Resnick and Zeckhauser, 2002): 
• Most trading relationships are one-time deals: 89% of all buyer-seller pairs conducted just 
one transaction during the five-month period covered by the data set. 
• Buyers left feedback on sellers 52.1% of the time; sellers on buyers 60.6% of the time. 
• Feedback is overwhelmingly positive; of feedback provided by buyers, 99.1% of comments 
were positive, 0.6% were negative and 0.3% were neutral. 
A number of studies have delved deeper into eBay data sets in order to uncover additional 
properties. Resnick, Zeckhauser, Swanson and Lockwood (2002) provide a comprehensive 
survey and methodological critique of these works. The author is aware of fourteen such studies, 
as summarized in Tables 2 and 3. All follow a similar logic, though the details vary in important 
ways. Apart from one laboratory experiment, each is an observational study of a particular 
category of items.

Table 3 Summary of principal questions 
 
The following points summarize the principal conclusions derived from a collective reading of 
these works: 
• Feedback profiles seem to affect both prices and the probability of sale. However, the 
precise effects are ambiguous; different studies focus on different components of eBay’s 
complex feedback profile and often reach different conclusions.  
• The impact of feedback profiles on prices and probability of sale is relatively higher for 
riskier transactions and more expensive products. 
• Among all different pieces of feedback information that eBay publishes for a member, 
the components that seem to be most influential in affecting buyer behavior are the 
overall number of positive and negative ratings, followed by the number of recently (last 
7 days, last month) posted negative comments. 
 
Towards a systematic discipline of feedback mechanism design 
The initial evidence provided by empirical studies, though useful, does not help answer the most 
important underlying question: how well does eBay’s mechanism work? In fact, these studies 
raise a whole new set of interesting questions. For example, why is the fraction of negative 
feedback so low? Is this an indication of the mechanism’s poor functioning (buyers are reluctant 
to express their true opinions fearing retaliatory bad ratings from sellers), or perhaps a 
consequence of the mechanism’s success (sellers are induced to behave well and therefore, there

----- Page 13 (native) -----
12
are simply very few dissatisfied buyers)? Why is the relationship between feedback and prices 
ambiguous? Is this an indication that the mechanism is not well designed, or perhaps that many 
users do not yet understand how to best process the information it provides?  
In the author’s opinion, the two most concrete evaluation criteria of a feedback mechanism’s 
performance ought to be (a) the expected payoffs of the outcomes induced by the mechanism for 
the various classes of stakeholders over the entire time horizon that matters for each of them and 
(b) the robustness of those outcomes against different assumptions about the participants’ 
behavior5.  
Calculation of payoffs requires an understanding of how eBay’s mechanism affects the behavior 
of buyers and sellers and how these behaviors evolve over time if all players are simultaneously 
pursuing their own interests. The tools of game theory are, thus, instrumental in developing 
conceptual models of such systems.  
Robustness considerations are especially important on eBay since the essence of feedback 
mechanisms relies on voluntary elicitation of behavior and this, in turn, relies on a number of 
assumptions about human rationality and beliefs. Two issues stand out as particularly important. 
First, since feedback provision is currently voluntary, the impact of incomplete or untruthful 
feedback needs to be better understood.  Second, the vulnerability of the system against strategic 
manipulation and online identity changes must be carefully studied. 
Once we have sufficiently understood the properties and performance of eBay’s current 
mechanism, the next obvious question is: how can this mechanism be improved? Answering this 
question requires a better understanding of the unique design possibilities of online feedback 
mechanisms. Here are a few examples of a much larger set of possibilities: 
• Online feedback mechanisms can precisely control the form of information they solicit: eBay 
asks users to rate transactions as positive, negative, or neutral. Would it have been better to 
ask users to rate transactions on a scale from 1-5 (which is what Amazon does)? Could a 
question with different phrasing lead to even higher efficiency? 
                                                 
5 Other plausible, but currently less well understood evaluation criteria include inducing outcomes that are perceived 
as “fair” by the majority of players and ensuring the privacy of the participants.

----- Page 14 (native) -----
13
• Feedback mechanisms control how information gets aggregated and what information is 
publicly available in feedback profiles. Currently, eBay’s feedback profile is a relatively 
complex artifact that includes the entire history of ratings together with a number of 
summary statistics. Since different users pay attention to different subsets of this information, 
this complicates the modeling and predictions of the induced outcomes. Would it be better to 
hide some parts of this information (for example, the detailed feedback history?) Would 
some other summary statistics (e.g., the fraction of negative ratings) lead to even more 
efficient outcomes? Would it be desirable to implement some sort of automated filtering of 
ratings that fail to satisfy some criteria? 
• Feedback submission is currently voluntary on eBay. Furthermore, there is currently no 
quality control of submitted feedback. Could eBay introduce a carefully designed system of 
buyer fees and rewards that elicits complete participation and truthful feedback?   
A third set of questions revolves around how online feedback mechanisms compare with more 
established institutions for achieving similar outcomes, such as formal contracts and advertising. 
These comparisons are important; their outcome will help determine how wide an impact these 
mechanisms will ultimately have. 
An objective of any discipline of design is to eventually abstract from the study of specific cases 
and reach some general principles and guidelines. In the case of feedback mechanisms, this 
objective translates to recognizing general classes of settings where feedback mechanisms may 
be usefully applied, identifying important families of feedback mechanism architectures, and 
understanding what architectures are best suited to what settings.  
Finally, design involves a responsibility for detail; this creates a need to deal with complications. 
In the service of design, several established OR/MS paradigms, such as decision theory and 
simulation, as well as empirical and experimental studies, are natural complements to game 
theory, both for qualifying these models, as well as for adapting them to account for the 
complexities of the “real world” and the bounded rationality of actual human behavior6.

economics not only for analyzing markets but also for designing them.

REPUTATION IN GAME THEORY AND ECONOMICS 
Given the importance of word-of-mouth networks in human society, reputation formation has 
been extensively studied by economists using the tools of game theory. This body of work is 
perhaps the most promising foundation for developing an analytical discipline of online feedback 
mechanism design. This section surveys past work on this topic, emphasizing the results that are 
most relevant to the design of online feedback mechanisms. Section 5 then discusses how this 
stylized body of work is being extended to address the unique properties of online environments. 
4.1 
Basic Concepts 
According to Wilson (1985), reputation is a concept that arises in repeated game settings when 
there is uncertainty about some property (the “type”) of one or more players in the mind of other 
players. If “uninformed” players have access to the history of past stage game outcomes, 
reputation effects then often allow informed players to improve their long-term payoffs by 
gradually convincing uninformed players that they belong to the type that best suits their 
interests. They do this by repeatedly choosing actions that make them appear to uninformed 
players as if they were of the intended type, thus “acquiring a reputation” for being of that type. 
The existence of some initial doubt in the mind of uninformed players regarding the type of 
informed players is crucial in order for reputation effects to occur. To see this, consider a 
repeated game between a long-run player and a sequence of short-run (one-shot) opponents. In 
every stage game, the long-run player can choose one of several actions but cannot credibly 
commit to any of those actions in advance. If there is no uncertainty about the long-run player’s 
type7, rational short-run players will then always play their stage-game Nash equilibrium 
response. Such behavior typically results in inefficient outcomes. 
                                                 
7 In other words, if short-run players are convinced that the long-run player is a rational utility-maximizing player 
whose stage-game payoffs are known with certainty.

Consider, for example, the following stylized version of a repeated “online auction” game. A 
long-lived seller faces an infinite sequence of sets of identical one-time buyers in a marketplace 
where there are only two kinds of products:  
• low-quality products that cost 0 to the seller and are worth 1 to the buyers, and  
• high-quality products that cost 1 to the seller and are worth 3 to the buyers.  
Each period the seller moves first, announcing the quality of the product he promises to buyers. 
Since high quality products are more profitable, the seller will always promise high quality. 
Buyers then compete with one another on a Vickrey auction and therefore bid amounts equal to 
their expected valuation of the transaction outcome. The winning bidder sends payment to the 
seller. The seller then has the choice of either “cooperating” (delivering a high quality good) or 
“cheating” (delivering a low quality good).  It is easy to see that this game has a unique subgame 
perfect equilibrium. In equilibrium the seller always cheats (delivers low quality), buyers each 
bid 1, each buyer’s expected payoff is zero and the seller’s expected payoff is 1.  
The ability to build a reputation allows the long-run player to improve his payoffs in such 
settings. Intuitively, a long-run player who has a track record of playing a given action (e.g. 
cooperate) often enough in the past acquires a reputation for doing so and is “trusted” by 
subsequent short-run players to do so in the future. However, why would a profit-maximizing 
long-term player be willing to behave in such a way and why would rational short-term players 
use past history as an indication of future behavior? 
To explain such phenomena, Kreps, Milgrom, Roberts and Wilson (1982), Kreps and Wilson 
(1982), and Milgrom and Roberts (1982) introduced the notion of “commitment” types. 
Commitment types are long-run players who are locked into playing the same action8. An 
important subclass of commitment types are Stackelberg types: long-run players who are locked 
into playing the so-called Stackelberg action. The Stackelberg action is the action to which the 
long-run player would credibly commit if he could. In the above “online auction” example the 
                                                 
8 Commitment types are sometimes also referred to as “irrational” types because they follow fixed, “hard-wired” 
strategies as opposed to “rational” profit-maximizing strategies. An alternative way to justify such players is to 
consider them as players with non-standard payoff structures s uch that the “commitment” action is their dominant 
strategy given their payoffs.

----- Page 17 (native) -----
16
Stackelberg action would be to cooperate; cooperation is the action that maximizes the seller’s 
lifetime payoffs if the seller could credibly commit to an action for the entire duration of the 
game9. Therefore, the Stackelberg type in this example corresponds to an “honest” seller who 
never cheats. In contrast, an “ordinary” or “strategic” type corresponds to an opportunistic seller 
who cheats whenever it is advantageous for him to do so. 
Reputation models assume that short-run players know that commitment types exist, but are 
ignorant of the type of the player they face. An additional assumption is that short-run players 
have access to the entire history of past stage game outcomes10. A player’s reputation at any 
given time then consists of the conditional posterior probabilities over that player’s type, given a 
short-run player’s prior over types and the repeated application of Bayes’ rule on the history of 
past stage game outcomes.  
In such a setting, when selecting his next move, the informed player must take into account not 
only his short-term payoff, but also the long-term consequences of his action based on what that 
action reveals about his type to other players. As long as the promised future gains due to the 
increased (or sustained) reputation that comes from playing the Stackelberg action offset 
whatever short-term incentives he might have to play otherwise, the equilibrium strategy for an 
“ordinary” informed player will be to try to “acquire a reputation” by masquerading as a 
Stackelberg type (i.e. repeatedly play the Stackelberg action with high probability). 
In the “online auction” example, if the promised future gains of reputation effects are high 
enough11, ordinary sellers are induced to overcome their short-term temptation to cheat and to try 
to acquire a reputation for honesty by repeatedly delivering high quality. Expecting this, buyers 
then place high bids, thus increasing the seller’s long-term payoffs. 
In general, reputation effects benefit the most patient player in the game: the player who has the 
longest time horizon (discounts future payoffs less) is usually the one who is able to reap the 
                                                 
9 If the seller could commit to cooperation (production of high quality), buyers would then each bid 2 and the 
seller’s expected per period payoff would be 2. 
10 The traditional justification for this assumption is that past outcomes are either publicly observable or explicitly 
communicated among short-run players. The emergence of online feedback mechanisms provides, of course, yet 
another justification (but see discussion of complications arising from the private observability of outcomes in such 
systems in Section 5.2). 
11 In this type of game this requires that the remaining horizon of the seller is long enough and that the profit margin 
of a single transaction is high enough relative to the discount factor.

benefits of reputation. Fudenberg and Levine (1992) show that this result holds even when 
players can observe only noisy signals of each other’s actions, so that the game has imperfect 
public monitoring. They prove that, if short-run players assign positive prior probability to the 
long-run player being a Stackelberg type, and if that player is sufficiently patient, then an 
ordinary long-run player achieves an average discounted payoff close to his commitment payoff 
(i.e., his payoff if he could credibly commit to the Stackelberg action). In order to obtain this 
payoff, the ordinary player spends long periods of time choosing the Stackelberg action with 
high probability12. 
4.2 
Reputation dynamics 
In most settings where reputation phenomena arise, equilibrium strategies evolve over time as 
information slowly leaks out about the types of the various players. In general, the derivation of 
closed-form solutions in repeated games with reputation effects is complicated. Nevertheless, a 
small number of specific cases have been studied. They provide interesting insight into the 
complex behavioral dynamics introduced by reputational considerations. 
 
Initial phase 
In most cases, reputation effects begin to work immediately and in fact are strongest during the 
initial phase, when players must work hard to establish a reputation. Holmstrom (1999) discusses 
an interesting model of reputational considerations in the context of an agent’s “career” 
concerns. Suppose that wages are a function of an employee’s innate ability for a task. 
Employers cannot directly observe an employee’s ability. However, they can keep track of the 
average value of her past task outputs. Outputs depend both on ability and labor. The employee’s 
objective is to maximize her lifetime wages while minimizing the labor she has to put in. At 
equilibrium, this provides incentives to the employee to work hard right from the beginning of 
her career in order to build a reputation for competence. In fact these incentives are strongest at 
the very beginning of her career when observations are most informative.  
                                                 
12 This result also requires that the stage game is either a simultaneous move game, or, in a sequential-move game, 
that the short-run players always observe whether or not the Stackelberg strategy has been played.

----- Page 19 (native) -----
18
During the initial phase of a repeated game, it is common that some players realize lower or even 
negative profits, while the community “learns” their type. In those cases players will only 
attempt to build a reputation if the losses from masquerading as a Stackelberg type in the current 
round are offset by the present value of the gains from their improved reputation in the later part 
of the game. In trading environments, this condition usually translates to the need for sufficiently 
high profit margins for “good quality” products so that the promise of future gains from 
sustaining a reputation is persuasive enough to offset the short-term temptation to cheat. This 
was first pointed out in Klein and Leffler (1981) and explored more formally in Shapiro (1983).  
Another case where reputation effects may fail to work is when short-run players are “too 
cautious” vis-à-vis the long-run player and therefore update their beliefs too slowly in order for 
the long-run player to find it profitable to try to build a reputation. Such cases may occur when, 
in addition to Stackelberg (“good”) types, the set of commitment types also includes “bad” or 
“inept” types: players who always play the action that the short-run players like least. In the 
“online auction” example, a “bad” type corresponds to a player who always cheats (because, for 
example, he lacks the capabilities that would enable him to deliver high quality.) If short-run 
players have a substantial prior belief that the long-run player may be a “bad” type, then the 
structure of the game may not allow them to update their beliefs fast enough to make it 
worthwhile for the long-run player to try to acquire a reputation. 
Diamond’s (1989) analysis of reputation formation in debt markets presents an example of such 
a setting. In Diamond’s model there are three types of borrowers: safe borrowers, who always 
select safe projects (i.e. projects with zero probability of default); risky borrowers, who always 
select risky projects (i.e. projects with higher returns if successful but with nonzero probability of 
default); and strategic borrowers who will select the type of project that maximizes their long 
term expected payoff. The objective of lenders is to maximize their long term return by offering 
competitive interest rates, while at the same time being able to distinguish profitable from 
unprofitable borrowers. Lenders do not observe a borrower’s choice of projects, but they do have 
access to her history of defaults. In Diamond’s model, if lenders believe that the initial fraction 
of risky borrowers is significant, then, despite the reputation mechanism, at the beginning of the 
game, interest rates will be so high that strategic players have an incentive to select risky 
projects. Some of them will default and will exit the game. Others will prove lucky and will

----- Page 20 (native) -----
19
begin to be considered as safe players. It is only after lucky strategic players have already 
acquired some initial reputation (and therefore begin to receive lower interest rates) that it 
becomes optimal for them to begin “masquerading” as safe players by consciously choosing safe 
projects in order to sustain their good reputation. 
 
Steady state (or lack thereof) 
In their simplest form, reputation games are characterized by an equilibrium in which the long-
run player repeatedly plays the Stackelberg action with high probability and the player’s 
reputation converges to the Stackelberg type. 
The existence of such steady states crucially depends on the ability to perfectly monitor the 
outcomes of individual stage games. For example, consider the “online auction” game that serves 
as an example throughout this section with the added assumption that buyers perfectly and 
truthfully observe and report the seller’s action. In such a setting, the presence of even a single 
negative rating on a seller’s feedback history reveals the fact that the seller is not honest. From 
then on, buyers will always choose the low bid in perpetuity. Since such an outcome is not 
advantageous for the seller, reputation considerations will induce the seller to cooperate forever. 
The situation changes radically if monitoring of outcomes is imperfect. In the online auction 
example, imperfect monitoring means that even when the seller produces high quality, there is a 
possibility that a buyer will post a negative rating, and, conversely, even when the seller 
produces low quality, the buyer may post a positive rating. A striking result is that in such 
“noisy” environments reputations cannot be sustained indefinitely: if a strategic player stays in 
the game long enough, short-run players will eventually learn his true type and the game will 
inevitably revert to one of the static Nash equilibria (Cripps, Mailath and Samuelson, 2002).  
To see the intuition behind this result, note that reputations under perfect monitoring are 
typically supported by a trigger strategy. Deviations from the equilibrium strategy reveal the type 
of the deviator and are punished by a switch to an undesirable equilibrium of the resulting 
complete-information continuation game. In contrast, when monitoring is imperfect, individual 
deviations neither completely reveal the deviator’s type nor trigger punishments. A single 
deviation has only a small effect on the beliefs of the short-term players. As a result, a player of

----- Page 21 (native) -----
20
normal type trying to maintain a reputation as a Stackelberg type incurs only a small cost (in 
terms of altered beliefs) from indulging in occasional deviations from Stackelberg play. In fact, it 
is clear that always playing the Stackelberg action cannot be an equilibrium strategy, because if 
the short-term players expect long-term players of normal type to behave that way, then they can 
actually deviate at no cost, since any bad outcome will be interpreted by the short-run players as 
a result of imperfect monitoring. But the long-run effect of many such small deviations from the 
commitment strategy is to drive the equilibrium to full revelation.  
Holmstrom’s paper provides an early special case of this striking result: the longer an employee 
has been on the market, the more “solid” the track record she has acquired and the less important 
her current actions in influencing the market’s future assessment of her ability. This provides 
diminishing incentives for her to keep working hard. Cripps, Mailath and Samuelson’s result 
then states that, if the employee stays on the market for a very long time, these dynamics will 
lead to an eventual loss of her reputation. 
If one tries to reconcile the above result with Fudenberg and Levine’s 1992 result on long-term 
payoffs induced by reputation, even more interesting phenomena come to the surface. If players 
eventually lose their reputation, in order for them to achieve average long-term payoffs that are 
close to their Stackelberg payoff, they must realize payoffs higher than their Stackelberg payoff 
during some stage of the game. This makes the dynamics of reputation formation in 
environments with imperfect monitoring quite complex indeed: an initial stage of reputation 
formation (with potentially suboptimal payoffs) is followed by a stage where the long-run player 
is able to occasionally “fool” short-run players and realize payoffs above his Stackelberg payoff, 
followed by a stage where short-run players eventually learn the truth and the game reverts to its 
static Nash equilibrium. 
These dynamics have important repercussions for systems like eBay. According to the Cripps, 
Mailath and Samuelson result, if eBay makes the entire feedback history of a seller available to 
buyers and if an eBay seller stays on the system long enough, once he establishes an initial 
reputation for honesty he will be tempted to cheat buyers every now and then. In the long term, 
this behavior will lead to an eventual collapse of his reputation and therefore of cooperative

----- Page 22 (native) -----
21
behavior. The conclusion is that, if buyers pay attention to a seller’s entire feedback history, 
eBay’s current mechanism fails to sustain long-term cooperation.  
 
Endgame considerations 
Since reputation relies on a tradeoff between current “restraint” and the promise of future gains, 
in finitely repeated games, incentives to maintain a reputation diminish and eventually disappear 
as the end of the game comes close. 
One solution to this problem is to introduce community membership rules that elicit good 
behavior throughout the game (Ba, 2001). For example, online communities can levy a 
sufficiently high entrance fee that is refundable subject to maintaining a good reputation upon 
exit.  
Another solution is to assign some post-mortem value to reputation, so that players find it 
optimal to maintain it throughout the game. For example, reputations can be viewed as assets 
that can be bought and sold in a market for reputations. Tadelis (1998) shows that a market for 
reputations is indeed sustainable. Furthermore, the existence of such a market provides “old” 
agents and “young” agents with equal incentives to exert effort (Tadelis, 2002). However, the 
long-run effects of introducing such a market can be quite complicated since good reputations 
are then likely to be purchased by “inept” agents for the purpose of depleting them (Mailath and 
Samuelson, 2001; Tadelis, 2002). Further research is needed in order to fully understand the 
long-term consequences of introducing markets for reputation as well as for transferring these 
promising concepts to the online domain.

NEW OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES OF ONLINE MECHANISMS 
In Section 2, I discussed a number of differences between online feedback mechanisms and 
traditional word-of-mouth networks. This section surveys our progress in understanding the 
opportunities and challenges that these special properties imply.

----- Page 23 (native) -----
22
5.1 
Understanding the impact of scalability  
Bakos and Dellarocas (2002) model the impact of information technology on online feedback 
mechanisms in the context of a comparison of the social efficiency of litigation and online 
feedback. They observe that online feedback mechanisms provide linkages between otherwise 
disconnected smaller markets (each having its own informal word-of-mouth networks) in which 
a firm operates. This, in turn, is equivalent to increasing the discount factor of the firm when 
considering the future impacts of its behavior on any given transaction. In trading relationships, a 
minimum discount factor is necessary to make reputation effects effective at all in inducing 
cooperative behavior (this is an alternative way to interpret Klein and Leffler, 1981 and Shapiro, 
1983). Once this threshold is reached, however, the power of reputation springs to life in a 
discontinuous fashion and high levels of cooperation can be supported. Thus the vastly increased 
potential scale of Internet-based feedback mechanisms and the resulting ability to cover a 
substantial fraction of economic transactions are likely to render these mechanisms into powerful 
quality assurance institutions in environments where the effectiveness of traditional word-of-
mouth networks has heretofore been limited. The social, economic and perhaps even political 
consequences of such a trend deserve careful study. For example, Bakos and Dellarocas show 
how, under certain conditions, sufficiently scalable feedback mechanisms can be a more socially 
efficient institution for inducing honest trade than the threat of litigation. 
5.2 
Eliciting sufficient and honest feedback   
Most game theoretic models of reputation formation assume that stage game outcomes (or 
imperfect signals thereof) are publicly observed. Online feedback mechanisms, in contrast, rely 
on private monitoring of stage game outcomes and voluntary feedback submission. This 
introduces two important new considerations: (a) ensuring that sufficient feedback is, indeed, 
provided, and (b) inducing truthful reporting. 
Economic theory predicts that voluntary feedback will be underprovided. There are two main 
reasons for this. First, feedback constitutes a public good: once available, everyone can costlessly 
benefit from it. Voluntary provision of feedback leads to suboptimal supply, since no individual 
takes account of the benefits that her provision gives to others. Second, provision of feedback 
presupposes that the rater will assume the risks of transacting with the ratee. Such risks are

----- Page 24 (native) -----
23
highest for new products. Prospective consumers may, thus, be tempted to wait until more 
information is available. However, unless somebody decides to take the risk of becoming an 
early evaluator, no feedback will ever be provided.  
Avery, Resnick and Zeckhauser (1999) analyze mechanisms whereby early evaluators are paid to 
provide information and later evaluators pay in order to balance the budget. They conclude that, 
of the three desirable properties for such a mechanism (voluntary participation, no price 
discrimination and budget balance), any two can be achieved, but not all three. 
Since monitoring is private and assessments usually subjective, an additional consideration is 
whether feedback is honest. Miller, Resnick and Zeckhauser (2002) propose mechanisms for 
eliciting honest feedback based on the technique of proper scoring rules. A scoring rule is a 
method for inducing decision makers to reveal their true beliefs about the distribution of a 
random variable by rewarding them based on the actual realization of the random variable and 
their announced distribution. A proper scoring rule has the property that the decision maker 
maximizes the expected score when he truthfully announces his belief about the distribution.  
Such mechanisms work as long as raters are assumed to act independently. Collusive behavior 
can defeat proper scoring rules. Unfortunately, online environments are particularly vulnerable to 
collusion. The development of effective mechanisms for dealing with collusive efforts to 
manipulate online ratings is currently an active area of research. Dellarocas (2000; 2001a) 
explores the use of robust statistics in aggregating individual ratings as a mechanism for reducing 
the effects of coordinated efforts to bias ratings. To this date, however, there is no effective 
solution that completely eliminates the problem. 
5.3 
Exploiting the information processing capabilities of feedback mediators 
Most game theoretic models of reputation assume that short-run players have access to the entire 
past history of stage game outcomes and update their prior beliefs by repeated application of 
Bayes’ rule on that information.  
Online feedback mediators completely control the amount and type of information that is made 
available to players. This opens an entire range of new possibilities. For example, feedback 
mediators can hide the detailed history of past feedback from short-term players and replace it

----- Page 25 (native) -----
24
with a summary statistic (such as the sum, mean or median of past ratings) or with any other 
function of the feedback history. They can filter outlying or otherwise suspect ratings. They can 
offer personalized feedback profiles, that is, present different information about the same long-
run player to different short-run players.  
Such information transformations can have non-trivial effects in the resulting equilibria and can 
often allow online feedback mechanisms to induce outcomes that are difficult or impossible to 
attain in standard settings. The following are two examples of what can be achieved. 
As discussed in Section 4.2, in environments with imperfect monitoring, traditional reputation 
models predict that reputations are not sustainable. Once firms build a reputation, they are 
tempted to “rest on the laurels”; this behavior, ultimately, leads to a loss of their reputation. 
Economists have used a variety of devices to construct models that do not exhibit this 
undesirable behavior. For instance, Mailath and Samuelson (1998) assume that in every period 
there is a fixed, exogenous probability that the type of the firm might change. Horner (2002) 
proposes a model in which competition among firms induces them to exert sustained effort. 
Online feedback mediators provide yet another, perhaps much more tangible, approach to 
eliminating such problems: by designing the mediator to only publish recent feedback, firms are 
given incentives to constantly exert high effort. In the context of eBay, this result argues for the 
elimination of the detailed feedback history from feedback profile and the use of summaries of 
recent ratings as the primary focal point of decision-making. Dellarocas (2003) studies the 
equilibria induced by a variation of eBay’s feedback mechanism in which the only information 
available to buyers is the sum of positive and negative ratings posted on a seller during the most 
recent N transactions. He finds that, in trading environments with opportunistic sellers, imperfect 
monitoring of a seller's effort level, and two possible transaction outcomes (corresponding to 
“high” and “low” quality respectively), such a mechanism induces high levels of cooperation that 
remain stable over time. Furthermore, the long-run payoffs are independent of the size of the 
window N. A mechanism that only publishes the single most recent rating is just as efficient as a 
mechanism that summarizes larger numbers of ratings.  
A second example of improving efficiency through proper mediator design can be found in 
Dellarocas (2002), which studies settings in which a monopolist sells products of various

----- Page 26 (native) -----
25
qualities and announces the quality of each product. The objective of a feedback mechanism in 
such settings is to induce truthful announcements. Once again, Cripps, Mailath and Samuelson’s 
result predicts that, in noisy environments, a mechanism that simply publishes the entire history 
of feedback will not lead to sustainable truth-telling. Dellarocas proposes a mechanism that acts 
as an intermediary between the seller and the buyers. The mechanism does not publish the 
history of past ratings. Instead, it keeps track of discrepancies between past seller quality 
announcements and corresponding buyer feedback and then punishes or rewards the seller by 
“distorting” the seller’s subsequent quality announcements so as to compensate him for whatever 
“unfair” gains or losses he has realized by misrepresenting the quality of his items. If consumers 
are risk-averse, at equilibrium this induces the seller to truthfully announce quality throughout 
the infinite version of the game. 
5.4 
Coping with easy name changes 
In online communities it is usually easy for members to disappear and re-register under a 
completely different online identity with zero or very low cost. Friedman and Resnick (2001) 
refer to this property as “cheap pseudonyms.” This property hinders the effectiveness of 
feedback mechanisms. Community members can build a reputation, milk it by cheating other 
members and then vanish and re-enter the community with a new identity and a clean record.  
Friedman and Resnick discuss two classes of approaches to this issue: either make it more 
difficult to change online identities, or structure the community in such a way that exit and re-
entry with a new identity becomes unprofitable. The first approach makes use of cryptographic 
authentication technologies and is outside the scope of this paper. The second approach is based 
on imposing an upfront cost to each new entrant, such that the benefits of “milking” one’s 
reputation are exceeded by the cost of subsequent re-entry. This cost can be an explicit entrance 
fee or an implicit cost of having to go through a reputation building (or “dues paying”) stage 
with low or negative profits. Friedman and Resnick show that, although dues paying approaches 
incur efficiency losses, such losses constitute an inevitable consequence of easy name changes. 
Dellarocas (2003) shows how such a “dues paying” approach can be implemented in trading 
environments where feedback is binary (i.e. transactions are rated as “good” or “bad”) and 
mediators only publish the sum of recent ratings. He proves that, in the presence of easy name

----- Page 27 (native) -----
26
changes, the design that results in optimal social efficiency is one where the mechanism sets the 
initial profile of new members to correspond to the “worst” possible reputation13. Dellarocas 
further demonstrates that, although this design incurs efficiency losses relative to the case where 
identity changes is not an issue, in settings with two possible transaction outcomes and 
opportunistic sellers, if players can costlessly change their identities its efficiency is the highest 
possible attainable by any mechanism. 
5.5 
Exploring alternative architectures 
The preceding discussion has assumed a centralized architecture in which feedback is explicitly 
provided and a single trusted mediator controls feedback aggregation and distribution. Though 
the design possibilities of even that simple architecture are not yet fully understood, centralized 
feedback mechanisms do not nearly exhaust the new possibilities offered by information 
technology. 
In recent years the field of multi-agent systems (Jennings, Sycara, and Wooldridge, 1998) has 
been actively researching online feedback systems as a technology for building trust and 
inducing good behavior in artificial societies of software agents. Two lines of investigation stand 
out as particularly novel and promising: 
Reputation formation based on analysis of “implicit feedback.” In our networked society, several 
traces of an agent’s activities can be found on publicly accessible databases. Instead of (or in 
addition to) relying on explicitly provided feedback, automated feedback mechanisms can then 
potentially infer aspects of an agent’s attributes, social standing and past behavior through 
collection and analysis of such “implicit feedback” information. 
Perhaps the most successful application of this approach to date is exemplified by the Google 
search engine. Google assigns a measure of reputation to each web page that matches the 
keywords of a search request. It then uses that measure to rank order search hits. Google’s page 
reputation measure is based on the number of links that point to a page, the number of links that 
                                                 
13 For example, if the mechanism summarizes the most recent 10 ratings, newcomers would begin the game with a 
profile that indicates that all 10 recent ratings were negative. An additional assumption is that buyers cannot tell how 
long a given seller has been on the market and therefore cannot distinguish between newcomers with “artificially 
tarnished” profiles and dishonest players who have genuinely accumulated many negative ratings.

----- Page 28 (native) -----
27
point to the pointing page, and so on (Brin and Page, 1998). The underlying assumption is that if 
enough people consider a page to be important enough in order to place links to that page from 
their pages, and if the pointing pages are “reputable” themselves, then the information contained 
on the target page is likely to be valuable. Google’s success in returning relevant results is 
testimony to the promise of that approach.  
Pujol , Sangüesa and Delgado (2002) apply network flow techniques in order to propose a 
generalization of the above algorithm that “extracts” the reputation of nodes in a general class of 
social networks. Sabater and Sierra (2002) describe how direct experience, explicit and implicit 
feedback can be combined into a single reputation mechanism. 
Basing reputation formation on implicit information is a promising solution to problems of 
eliciting sufficient and truthful feedback. Careful modeling of the benefits and limitations of this 
approach is needed in order to determine in what settings it might be a viable substitute or 
complement of voluntary feedback provision. 
Decentralized feedback architectures. Our discussion of feedback mechanisms so far has 
implicitly assumed the honesty of feedback mediators. However, mediators are also designed and 
operated by parties whose interests may sometimes diverge from those of society at large. 
Decentralizing the sources of feedback is a promising approach for achieving robustness in the 
presence of both potentially dishonest mediators and privacy concerns. A number of 
decentralized feedback mechanisms have recently been proposed (Zacharia, Moukas and Maes, 
2000; Mui, Szolovits and Ang, 2001; Sen and Sajja, 2002; Yu and Singh, 2002). Though novel 
and intriguing, none of these works provides a rigorous analysis of the behavior induced by the 
proposed mechanisms, nor an explicit discussion of their advantages relative to other 
alternatives. More collaboration is needed in this promising direction between both computer 
scientists, who better understand the new possibilities offered by technology, and management 
scientists, who better understand the tools for evaluating the potential impact of these new 
systems.

5.6 
Accounting for bounded rationality 
The ambition of a discipline of online feedback mechanism design is the inducement of social 
outcomes with a degree of precision that approaches that of engineering design. This, in turn, 
requires precise modeling not only of the technological components of those systems but also of 
the human users.  
It is now well known that human behavior does not conform to the traditional economics 
assumptions of rational maximization of well-defined utility functions 14.  Two recent laboratory 
experiments provide some initial insight into human behavior vis-à-vis feedback mechanisms. 
Bolton, Katok and Ockenfels (2002) compare trading in a market with (automatically generated) 
feedback to a market without, as well as to a market in which the same people interact with each 
other repeatedly (partners market). They find that, while the feedback mechanism induces a 
substantial improvement in trading efficiency, it falls short of the efficiency achieved in the 
partners market. Keser (2002) reports the results of a repeated trust game among strangers with 
and without the ability to provide feedback. She finds that the presence of a feedback mechanism 
significantly increases the levels of trust and trustworthiness. Furthermore, efficiency is slightly 
higher if trading partners are informed of the entire distribution of each other’s previous ratings 
than if they are informed of each other’s most recent rating only.

CONCLUSIONS: OPPORTUNITIES FOR OR/MS RESEARCH 
Online feedback mechanisms harness the remarkable ability of the Web to not only disseminate, 
but also collect and aggregate information from large communities at very low cost, in order to 
artificially construct large-scale word-of-mouth networks. Best known so far as a technology for 
building trust and fostering cooperation in online marketplaces, these mechanisms are poised to 
have a much wider impact on organizations. As discussed in the Introduction, their popularity 
has potentially important implications for a wide range of management activities, such as 
customer acquisition and retention, brand building, product development, and quality assurance. 
The study of such topics clearly falls within the domain of OR/MS.

The design of online feedback mechanisms can greatly benefit from the insights produced by 
more than twenty years of economics and game theory research on the topic of reputation. These 
results need to be extended to take into account the unique new properties of online 
environments, such as their unprecedented scalability, the ability to precisely design the type of 
feedback information that is solicited and distributed, and the volatility of online identities. The 
following list contains what the author considers to be the most important open areas of research 
in feedback mechanism design: 
• Scope and explore the design space and limitations of online feedback mechanisms. 
Understand what set of design parameters work best in what settings. Develop models and 
prototype implementations of such systems.  
• Develop effective solutions to the problems of sufficient participation, easy identity changes 
and strategic manipulation of online feedback. 
• Conduct theory-driven experimental and empirical research that sheds more light on buyer 
and seller behavior vis-à-vis such mechanisms. 
• Compare the relative efficiency of feedback mechanisms to the efficiency of more 
established mechanisms for dealing with information asymmetries (such as state-backed 
contractual guarantees and advertising); develop theory-driven guidelines for deciding which 
set of mechanisms to use when. 
• Understand how decision-makers must adapt their strategies to react to the presence of such 
mechanisms in areas such as marketing, product development, and customer service. 
The power of online feedback mechanisms has its roots in the strategic side effects brought about 
by the increased interdependencies they create among firms, their customers, their partners, and 
their competitors. As the mathematical study of interaction of self-interested agents, game theory 
is the natural foundation for the study of online feedback mechanisms. Game theoretic analyses, 
however, are often based on stylized abstractions of real systems and are fundamentally 
grounded on the assumption of rational, utility maximizing economic agents.

The traditional paradigms of OR/MS can play an important role in translating the conceptual 
insights of game theoretic models into concrete guidelines for building (and reacting to) large-
scale feedback mechanisms that can influence the dynamics of entire industries or societies.  For 
example, computational methods can help analyze games that may be too complex to solve 
analytically. Laboratory experiments can inform about how people will behave when confronted 
with these mechanisms, both when they are inexperienced and as they gain experience. Finally, 
game-theoretic models can often be approximated by generally more tractable, decision-theoretic 
approaches15.  
Large-scale online feedback mechanisms have the potential to influence the organizational 
dynamics of the 21st century in a similarly powerful way in which the ability to mass broadcast 
affected business and society in the 20th century. OR/MS has a lot to offer in helping 
organizations understand how these mechanisms can improve efficiency in a variety of practical 
settings, as well as how companies should adapt their strategies to react to their presence.
