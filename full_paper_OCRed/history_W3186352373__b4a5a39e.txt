Metal additive manufacturing involves manufacturing techniques that add material to produce metallic
components, typically layer by layer. The substantial growth in this technology is partly driven by its
opportunity for commercial and performance beneﬁts in the aerospace industry. The fundamental oppor-
tunities for metal additive manufacturing in aerospace applications include: signiﬁcant cost and lead-
time reductions, novel materials and unique design solutions, mass reduction of components through
highly efﬁcient and lightweight designs, and consolidation of multiple components for performance
enhancement or risk management, e.g. through internal cooling features in thermally loaded components
or by eliminating traditional joining processes. These opportunities are being commercially applied in a
range of high-proﬁle aerospace applications including liquid-fuel rocket engines, propellant tanks, satel-
lite components, heat exchangers, turbomachinery, valves, and sustainment of legacy systems. This paper
provides a comprehensive review of metal additive manufacturing in the aerospace industry (from indus-
trial/popular as well as technical literature). This provides a current state of the art, while also summa-
rizing the primary application scenarios and the associated commercial and technical beneﬁts of additive
manufacturing in these applications. Based on these observations, challenges and potential opportunities
are highlighted for metal additive manufacturing for each application scenario.

and general aviation. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has had a
substantial negative impact on aerospace sector revenue, with a
decline from $342.2 billion in 2019 down to $298 billion in 2020
[1]. This decline was primarily caused by air travel restrictions,
social distancing protocols and other restrictions imposed on the
commercial aviation industry during the ongoing COVID-19 pan-
demic. Despite this challenge, the aerospace sector is expected to
grow to $430.87 billion revenue by the year 2025 [1]. This growth
is primarily due to the long-term demand for new commercial air-
craft, increased global military expenditure, high market activity in
the space sector and substantial research and development ongo-
ing throughout the pandemic [1].
Manufacturing in the aerospace sector is subject to numerous
interacting technical and economic objectives of: functional perfor-
mance, lead time reduction, lightweighting, complexity, cost manage-
ment, and sustainment. Each of these objectives have strong
relationships to one another and considerations from each factor
must be considered carefully when selecting an optimal design
solution. The relative importance of these objectives depends on
the speciﬁc aerospace application, but in general terms these
objectives can be described as follows:
 The aerospace sector requires the delivery of safety–critical
components that must operate in their intended environment (-
functional performance) in small production volumes with rela-
tively inﬂexible delivery schedule. Lead time reduction is
therefore highly relevant to the aerospace sector as this allows
rapid product certiﬁcation and retains ﬂexibility in design of
high value components.
 Lightweighting is relevant to the technical and economic perfor-
mance of aerospace structures. Speciﬁcally, the technical per-
formance and allowable mission-deﬁned payload of aerospace
structures is physically limited, meaning that system mass
reduction directly relates to enhanced economic and technical
performance, including reduced fuel costs, lower emissions, lar-
ger payloads and increased range.
 The objective of lightweighting is tempered by the economic
constraints of cost management, whereby a speciﬁc ﬁnancial
resource is available for a speciﬁc design objective. Cost man-
agement, lightweighting and lead time reduction objectives
are interrelated, whereby the allowable system cost generally
increases for solutions that are able to achieve lightweighting
or lead time reduction objectives. Cost management applies to
all aspects of component use, including certiﬁcation and main-
tenance, and opportunities for cost management by reduced
certiﬁcation risk.
 A critical challenge to metal additive manufacturing (AM) appli-
cations in aerospace is the hurdle of certiﬁcation; requiring that
regulatory bodies be conﬁdent that the AM systems are funda-
mentally well understood, and can be repeatably designed and
inspected such that reliability and safety expectations can be
satisﬁed. These certiﬁcation requirements vary according to
the criticality of the proposed AM system as being safety or
mission-critical or otherwise. Practical certiﬁcation requires
connection with existing standards for traditional manufactur-
ing as well as to standards emerging for AM processes.
 Aerospace structures are generally high-complexity, low volume
systems, where the challenges associated with sustainment can
become substantial. Sustainment challenges include part avail-
ability for aging aircraft, remanufacture and repair, and re-
certiﬁcation of existing aircraft for alternate uses.
 Complexity is inherent to the designs where often hundreds, or
thousands of parts make up systems and subsystems to achieve
the desired functional performance in the intended environment.
These systems are integrated into the overall ﬂight system that
can often exceed millions of components. These components
are high in complexity to allow for functional performance
(structural, ﬂow, thermal, reliability, durability, compatibility,
etc.) as well as weight reduction [2,3].
In the drive to improve efﬁciency continuously through cost,
lead time reduction and attempts to lower the mass of ﬂight com-
ponents, high-performance materials are used, with increasingly
complex designs. This must be done within a reasonable cost and
schedule to meet commercial orders or mission requirements. Tra-
ditional manufacturing systems and strategies have been devel-
oped over many decades to accommodate these aerospace design
objectives for numerous application types; however AM is and will
continue to have a profound impact on the design and manufactur-
ing. This AM digital transformation, often touted as Industry 4.0,
will increase its market size in the aerospace sector to $3.187 bil-
lion by the year 2025 with an average compound annual growth
rate (CAGR) of 20.24% [4]. Research into AM in aerospace has also
seen exponential growth over the last decade.1 In addition to this
scholarly literature, much relevant work exists in the form of techni-
cal reports, popular literature and publicity articles from commercial
aerospace suppliers, with technical details sometimes restricted for
commercial reasons.
Additive manufacturing, unlike conventional subtractive manu-
facturing techniques, utilizes layer by layer manufacturing based
on a common feedstock, typically powder or wire that is melted
or fused by a heat source and solidiﬁes to produce the ﬁnal geom-
etry based on a digitally deﬁned heat source trajectory [5]. The
advantages of the use of additive manufacturing for aerospace
components are the reduced lead time and associated cost, the
ability to design and manufacture complex geometries that enable
lightweighting,
consolidation
of
multiple
components
and
improvements in performance; within cost and timeline con-
straints, hence offering improved programmatic and technical risk
management [6,7]. By utilizing the design freedom of metal AM, it
is possible to optimize the material distribution, reducing mass
while maintaining the mechanical and other performance require-
ments of the component. It is also possible to combine compo-
nents, reducing risk and cost for multiple components and
reducing
potential
failure
modes
across
joints.
Additionally,
enhanced performance (above that of conventional manufacturing)
is possible by utilizing mechanical, thermal and other optimization
approaches for the design of complex parts that were previously
impossible to manufacture, incorporating internal features such
as conformal cooling channels on combustion chambers or turbine
blades, for example [8,9]. While the reduced lead times are the pre-
sent main driver for the use of AM in aerospace applications, speci-
ﬁc manufacturing scenarios give AM advantages over traditional
manufacturing as schematically illustrated in Fig. 1 and discussed
below.
The complexity afforded by the AM process is a large advantage
of this technology, as new designs can be realized for enhanced
mechanical and thermal performance and reduced system mass,
not possible by other manufacturing methods. The inherent capac-
ity for complexity within AM design enables lightweighting by both
the consolidation of multiple components into one and by the
opportunity for increased technical efﬁciency. Despite persistent
misconceptions regarding the constraint-free nature of AM tech-
nologies, they are highly compatible with high complexity out-
comes; thereby enabling lightweighting by deploying material as
required for the technical response (structural, vibratory or ther-
mal) rather than as constrained by the associated manufacturing
process. A systematic review of AM design constraints is provided

in [14]. It should be noted that the complexity should be appropri-
ately traded within the design and throughout the lifecycle of AM
components as it can add additional post-processing operations or
unintended operational challenges if not fully understood. Algo-
rithmic design methods, often referred to as generative design
and opportunities for topology optimisation are reviewed in [15].
Part consolidation refers to the re-design of multiple interacting
components as a single integrated system, thereby enabling sub-
stantial enhancement in technical performance. The integration
of multiple components enables removal of mating surfaces and
structures, thereby increasing structural efﬁciency and reducing
the costs associated with inspection and certiﬁcation of mating

structures. Furthermore, the consolidation of multiple parts may
substantially reduce overall fabrication costs. This cost reduction
is enabled by the direct reduction of manufacturing lifecycle costs
as well as the reduction in non-recurring costs associated with
design, certiﬁcation and risk-management of the failure modes
that are associated with part interactions.
The aerospace sector relies heavily on machined forged and bil-
let structures for high-value structural systems. This manufactur-
ing methodology provides high certainty in ﬁnal component
quality, as billet materials are readily certiﬁed for porosity and
microstructure, but adds substantial direct manufacturing costs
and induced costs due to high production lead times. Forging
requires the expensive design, manufacture and trialling of pre-
forming dies and billet machining is inherently expensive with
typical buy-to-ﬂy ratios2 estimated at 20:1. For example, a ﬁnal pro-
duct with a mass of 10 kg would require 200 kg of stock materials as
discussed in [16]. Others claim this ratio is closer to 40:1 [17]. The
unused material is waste and is recycled or reprocessed if possible,
adding extensive costs to all projects.
By the nature of the layer-by-layer manufacturing process, AM
produces little to no waste with buy-to-ﬂy ratios of between 1:1
and 3:1 [18,19]. Using far less stock material by mass compared
to traditional manufacturing techniques, AM has the potential to
reduce the cost of manufacturing aerospace components substan-
tially all while simplifying the recycling and reprocessing pro-
cesses, subject to proper precautions. Many aerospace alloys can
have long lead times to produce the required wrought starting
stock material. Since many AM processes start with a powder or
wire feedstock, which is readily available for common alloys, this
lead time can be substantially reduced for commercially available
materials. Additional costs and lead time in processing of aero-
space components can include specialty tooling and ﬁxturing
[20]. Currently, the signiﬁcant reduction in lead times is one of
the major advantages of AM in this industry.
Historically, AM was used extensively for rapid prototyping in
the form of part representation and initial functional testing before
infusion into commercial end-use applications. While ﬂight use of
AM has roots back to the early 2000s, the decade from 2010 to
2020 expanded the use of AM to include ﬁnal production, including
mission-critical components [21]. This digital transition in manu-
facturing focus has been successful due to improvements in the
underlying technology and in the improved understanding of the
technology and its supply chain, as well as the rigor being applied
to standardization and certiﬁcation [22].
The basic principle of AM is to build up components layer-by-
layer directly from 3D model data created using Computer-Aided
Design (CAD) to near net or ﬁnal shape. This is a complex proce-
dure as a large multitude of process parameters have possible
effects on the quality of produced components [14,23]. Continued
improvements in the understanding of these parameters has stea-
dily lessened the associated quality impacts, however. The process
parameters including the power, scan speed, hatch spacing or over-
lap between tracks, scan strategy (e.g. use of contours, angle
change of hatch tracks per layer, etc.), among many other parame-
ters may inﬂuence the process and thus the quality and properties
of the manufactured components. This includes surface roughness,
porosity, residual stress and associated cracks or warping of com-
ponents, unique microstructures, as well as anisotropy of the
material. This traces back to the roots of materials characterization
and allowing an understanding as part of the Process-Structure-
Properties linkages ultimately leads to better performance [24].
Further disadvantages of AM include limited materials, uncertainty
in material properties, speciﬁc design constraints inherent to AM,
post-processing requirements, waste generation (used powder,
build plates, failed builds), increased requirements of design skills
to allow lower-mass components with feasible complex designs,
often utilizing time-consuming topology optimization software
workﬂows, as well as the need for strict quality control and certi-
ﬁcation of the process [25]. While accessibility to AM machines is
increasing, the technology is not as readily available as traditional
manufacturing techniques so the supply chain requires matura-
tion. Post-processing is an area that challenges AM, requiring spe-
cialized and custom-developed or optimized thermal treatments,
part cleanliness, and surface enhancements to improve rough
surfaces.
All aerospace manufacturing is subject to strict quality controls
such as Quality Systems - Aerospace SAE AS9100 and Standard for
Additively Manufactured Spaceﬂight Hardware MSFC-STD-3716,
NASA Standard 6030 [14,26–31], but this is further exacerbated
by the complexity of the AM processes and many possible inﬂu-
ences on component quality. This is especially true as the technol-
ogy has matured only recently and many studies have reported
widely disparate mechanical properties [32–34], especially fatigue
performance [35–37]. This leads to uncertainties in the material
performance and in the required controls which may be different
from traditional manufacturing. Various international standards
are currently under development to address this [14]. With appro-
priate quality controls and optimization procedures, the issues
mentioned above can all be mitigated or minimized [14,38]. Signif-
icant post-processing
is
generally required
such as
powder
removal, thermal processing, supports and baseplate removal,
hot isostatic pressing (HIP), surface polishing, and often ﬁnal
machining.
Despite the disadvantages mentioned, speciﬁc scenarios exist
where AM is well suited to aerospace applications, with clear
technical advantages over traditional manufacturing methods.
This paper provides a comprehensive review of applications of
metal AM in the aerospace industry, thereby also providing a
review of the current state of the art. Through demonstrating
these successful examples, the beneﬁts of AM and the chal-
lenges associated with AM in aerospace are systematically doc-
umented; thereby promoting the further application of AM in
this sector, taking into full consideration the challenges and
requirements.
2. Key concepts related to AM for aerospace
2.1. Additive manufacturing technologies
Additive manufacturing, outlined by the international standard
ISO/ASTM 52900 [39], comprises seven process categories which
include directed energy deposition (DED) and powder bed fusion
(PBF), both allowing the fabrication of metal components with
near full density. Other process categories are not discussed in
detail as they are still evolving and still at lower technology
readiness levels (TRL). Metal AM is reviewed in more detail in
[40], including an overview of the processes, resulting structure/
microstructure, and properties of manufactured materials. In par-
ticular, laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) is gaining traction in
industry due to its high resolution, high-quality part production
capabilities, combining ﬁne feature sizes with adequate build vol-
umes for many part sizes required [14]. Once the process is opti-
mized, the resulting components produced can boast mechanical
properties exceeding those of conventional manufacturing tech-
niques with proper procedures in place [34,41]. AM methods,
key technologies and relevant materials for aerospace applica-
tions are brieﬂy described below.

production component.

2.1.1. Powder bed fusion processes
(a) Laser Powder Bed Fusion
The L-PBF technology utilizes high power laser(s) to melt and
solidify individual layers of metal powder [14,42]. The L-PBF
process involves powder feedstock delivered and coated onto a
platform where the powder is selectively melted and solidiﬁed
according to the CAD design. The laser scanning strategy and layer
thickness, inert atmosphere and gas ﬂow, and various other param-
eters are selected by the user and need to be optimized for the par-
ticular material and system used [14]. This is the most common
form of metal AM with options for machines from a host of manu-
facturers and a large collection of materials such as aluminium
alloys, steel alloys, copper alloys, nickel and iron superalloys, pre-
cious metals, refractory metals, titanium alloys and many more.
Although L-PBF is known to produce fully dense components with
high precision in a relatively short time [43], the manufacturing
process is relatively expensive and is only applicable in industries
with high-value components and where higher performance can
result in cost reduction, such as the aerospace industry. Typical
minimum features sizes of ~ 0.2–0.4 mm with maximum part size
of about 300–400 mm cover a range suitable for most small-
medium part size requirements [14]. Larger systems are now
becoming available using multiple laser sources for enhanced pro-
ductivity and with build volumes up to 500  280  850 mm [44].
Even larger systems (>1 m) are being developed but not commer-
cially available or widely accessible yet.
(b) Electron Beam Powder Bed Fusion
Electron beam powder bed fusion (EB-PBF) is an AM process
that uses a high-energy electron beam to melt metal powder layer
by layer to fabricate fully dense solid components. The components
are manufactured in a vacuum due to the electron beam requiring
a vacuum. This reduces impurities in oxygen sensitive materials.
These systems often use preheating by rapidly scanning the elec-
tron beam across the powder prior to melting of a layer, assisting
to minimize residual stresses. Mechanical properties of compo-
nents manufactured through EB-PBF can be similar to that of cast
materials, demonstrating the suitability of components manufac-
tured through this process as compared to traditional manufactur-
ing methods [45]. The maximum build sizes are similar to that of L-
PBF, with latest models having circular build diameter 350 mm and
height 380 mm. These systems typically use larger feedstock pow-
der sizes, which results in larger roughness values. However, the
systems are well developed and offer relatively short build times
due to the high power and rapid scanning of the electron beam.
2.1.2. Directed energy deposition processes
Dissimilar to powder bed processes, in directed energy deposi-
tion (DED) techniques, the stock material is deposited locally using
powder or feeding wire feedstock directly into the meltpool which
is created by an energy source, e.g. electrical arc, lasers or electron
beams [41]. Since DED does not rely on a powder bed, it has some
beneﬁts in geometrical freedom compared to other AM techniques
and is not limited to build size restrictions. Very large components
can therefore be manufactured with this technique. DED machines
are commonly used in the repair of high value existing components
such as turbine blades. DED has a poorer resolution (minimum fea-
ture sizes of about 1 mm) [46,47] compared to that of powder-bed
based technologies and is therefore used for larger components
with reduced resolution [48], or where post processing machining
operations can be performed.
There are various forms of DED techniques that each have dif-
ferent advantages and disadvantages. Laser Powder DED (LP-
DED) is one of the most common using a laser as the energy source
and a powder feedstock. The deposition head is attached to a
robotic or gantry system and uses a local inert or fully purged
chamber. In LP-DED the powder is blown into the melt pool and
joined with the previous layer creating a freeform structure. An
alternate DED method is Laser Wire DED (LW-DED), which uses
the same concept, but the feedstock is wire. The wire feedstock
may be off-axis or co-axial and has an advantage with high mate-
rial efﬁciency, but at a reduced resolution. Other systems such as
Arc Wire DED (AW-DED) and Electron Beam DED (EB-DED) use
wire but with an electric arc or electron beam as energy sources,
respectively. Each of these processes has differing feature resolu-
tion and deposition rates, which can result in varying heating
and cooling rates and subsequent variance in metallurgical charac-
teristics and in mechanical and thermophysical properties [49–52].
2.2. Materials for AM aerospace
Distinctive materials for AM in aerospace are aluminium alloys,
stainless steel, titanium alloys, nickel-and iron-based superalloys,
copper alloys, cobalt alloys, refractory alloys, and steels, among
other metallic materials. Most of these are used in pre-alloyed
powder form, most often produced by gas atomization, or in wire
form depending on the process [5,40].
Aluminium alloys have been an integral material since the
inception of the aerospace industry. Their low cost, light weight,
high strength to weight ratio and ease of manufacturing character-
istics have resulted in aluminium being the most widespread
material in aerospace until recent advances in composite technolo-
gies [53,54]. However, aluminium alloys suffer from poor elevated
temperature capabilities, and in some high strength aluminium
alloys, corrosion resistance is poor, thus limiting their applications.
Stainless steels are used in several aircraft and space compo-
nents due to the high strength to weight ratio, excellent durability,
hardness and good mechanical properties at elevated tempera-
tures. Various classes of stainless steels are often used with AM
including austenitic, precipitation hardened (PH), and maraging
(martensitic and aged) [55,56]. These forms of stainless steel are
used across components for engine and exhaust systems, hydraulic
components, heat exchangers, landing gear systems, and structural
joints. Stainless steels also exhibit high corrosion, oxidation, and
wear resistance depending on the environments [57,72,73].
Titanium alloys have been the subject of much interest in aero-
space applications due to their high speciﬁc strength, excellent cor-
rosion resistance and high-temperature stability [58,59]. Titanium
alloys are also electrochemically compatible with polymer matrix-
carbon ﬁber composites (PMCs) which are extensively used in
modern aircraft [60]. Titanium alloys see substantial use in aircraft
due to their high-temperature stability and speciﬁc strength [60].
Cryogenic applications, commonly found in rocket propellant
tanks, are also potential use-cases for titanium alloys since they
exhibit no ductile to brittle transition at low temperatures [60].
Nickel- and iron-based superalloys have become key materials
for the manufacturing of disks and blades in high-pressure tur-
bines for gas turbine engines. They are also used in many high tem-
perature
and
cryogenic
applications
such
as
valves,
turbomachinery, injectors, igniters, and manifolds [61,62]. Their
excellent mechanical properties under extremely high tempera-
tures, high pressures and in corrosive environments improve the
efﬁciency of modern aircraft engines substantially [63]. Currently,
over 50% of the mass of an advanced aircraft engine is comprised of
nickel-based superalloys [64]. Iron-based superalloys are com-
monly used in high pressure hydrogen applications such as rocket
engines to mitigate hydrogen environment embrittlement [65].
Copper-alloys are commonly used in heat exchangers, such as
for combustion chambers for liquid rocket engines. This high heat
ﬂux environment requires a high strength and high conductivity

alloy to properly cool the walls of the thrust chamber with a high
pressure propellant or oxidizer. Common AM copper alloys used
include GRCop-42, GRCop-84, C18150 (Cu-Cr-Zr), C18200 (Cu-Cr),
and GlidCop [66–71].
Other metal alloys that can be used in aerospace applications
include refractory materials such as niobium, tantalum, and tung-
sten and alloys such as C-103 [74]. These are used in extreme tem-
perature applications such as in-space radiatively-cooled thrusters.
Other materials such as Cobalt-based alloys including Co-Cr and
Stellite are also used for a variety of elevated temperature applica-
tions [75,76].
Many of these materials exist as feedstock for metal AM machi-
nes and have seen varying levels of research into the material char-
acteristics and properties produced using AM methods, with
demonstrations of mechanical properties equal to, and sometimes
exceeding those associated with typical manufacturing methods
[77–80]. For this to be achieved, the process parameters and post-
processing operations must be optimized to minimize porosity,
residual stress, crack propensity and includes optimized post
processing steps as required to enhance the material properties,
including optimized heat treatments and HIP. For more information
on AM materials and related issues, the reader is referred to [40] and
Table 1 summarizes the more popular materials for AM in aerospace.
Some of the alloys highlighted in this table include variations such as
Metal Matrix Composites (MMC), including Al-MMC and Ni-MMC.
Many of these alloys have also been used in test and ﬂight applica-
tions as discussed later in Table 2 and Table 3.
2.3. Development of new alloys
Early adoption of AM techniques used materials that had trace-
ability to common alloys manufactured by traditional processes.
Many of these alloys are not the best-ﬁt alloys for the applications
in question, and have challenges in AM processing due to cracking
or
susceptibility
to
porosity
formation,
oxidation
or
other
unwanted properties. AM offers a signiﬁcant opportunity to intro-
duce new and custom alloys that allow for more optimized pro-
cessing to reduce cracking or to mitigate other challenges, while
being further optimized for the end application. Examples of this
include the introduction of custom aluminium alloys such as
7A77, 6061-RAM2, AlSi10Mg, Scalmalloy, and many others that
offer high strength and successful AM builds with otherwise
crack-prone alloys [82–86]. NASA also recognized the need for
advanced alloys in AM and initiated development of the GRCop-
84 and GRCop-42 copper-alloys for use in high heat ﬂux applica-
tions, in addition to the iron-based superalloy NASA HR-1 alloy
for use in high pressure hydrogen environments [87]. Many other
examples of custom superalloys, aluminium, refractory metals
and others being designed speciﬁcally for AM processing are being
addressed as the industry need for more materials has been iden-
tiﬁed [88–91]. Beyond monolithic alloys, AM also provides the
opportunity to create custom bimetallic and multimetallic material
solutions, adding material locally within a design for optimization
of thermal or structural loads. These can include a discrete material
transition or a function gradient material [92–96].
2.4. Reduction in processing time
One of the key motivations for use of AM in aerospace is the sig-
niﬁcant cost reduction and improved lead times achievable com-
pared to traditional manufacturing [97]. Aerospace components
are complex to manufacture and often require unique alloys that
have long procurement lead times in a wrought form and can also
take signiﬁcant processing time to form, machine, build, or assem-
ble during the transition from the starting stock to a ﬁnal part or
subsystem. This lead time is compounded due to the various
inspections and traceability requirements of material and parts
throughout the process. The parts must follow a rigid process to
ensure they are fabricated safely and meet standards and certiﬁca-
tions while also meeting the design intent. AM is no different and
must still follow strict requirements to be ﬂown safely in aerospace
applications, but the lead time can be drastically reduced and the
supply chain simpliﬁed. This is true for new part designs, but prob-
ably more important for spares or replacements that are out of pro-
duction. This simpliﬁed supply chain and reduction in lead time,
including logistical beneﬁts, presents a substantial opportunity to
reduce cost [98]. There are several examples that have demon-
strated cost reductions of 50% and lead time reductions of 50% or
more [9].
2.5. Process certiﬁcation
Additive manufacturing requires strict control of the entire pro-
cess from powder through AM build and post-processing. This
includes a detailed understanding of the process parameters that
impact the microstructure and subsequent mechanical and ther-
mophysical material properties. This certiﬁcation process must
be determined early in the design process to include both a
methodology and traceability throughout all stages of AM. This
includes implementation of adequate non-destructive evaluation
(NDE) techniques, surface enhancements to improve fatigue per-
formance, optimization of thermal processing, and other pre-,
build and post-processing operations. Methodologies described
by standardization and government organizations require strict
control of machine parameters, powder lots, and include a detailed
understanding of variations in powder or off-nominal build opera-
tions to ensure that parts meet the intended design and metallur-
gical characteristics.
Metal AM processes derive their ﬂexibility and low-production
costs to their fundamental unit material inputs (either powder,
wire or sheet) which are then additively joined to generate the
required as-manufactured geometry (including additional support-
ing structures) which are then post-processed as required to gen-
erate the ﬁnal component. The production capabilities inherent
to metal AM technologies allow previously unachievable system
efﬁciency, however the fundamental certiﬁcation challenge for
these high-complexity AM components and systems is commensu-
rately high. AM production phases are not compatible with avia-
tion certiﬁcation protocols derived for traditional manufacture
[41,99], consequently the certiﬁcation of these components is chal-
lenging; for applied engineering of AM products it is therefore nec-
essary either to accommodate existing certiﬁcation protocols or to
actively engage with emerging protocols for AM structures.
Existing certiﬁcation protocols are derived as a function of crit-
icality and associated failure modes, consequently, the challenge
for metal AM certiﬁcation is lower for non-safety critical applica-
tions, and for applications that are subject to monotonic failure
modes (such as static deﬂection) rather than for complex failure
modes such as corrosion cracking or multiaxial fatigue. Therefore
the certiﬁcation challenge for a statically loaded assembly ﬁxture
may be less than for a non-safety critical structure, than for a
dynamically loaded structural safety–critical component.
Emerging standards are under active development from govern-
ment entities, industry groups, and standard organizations. These
emerging protocols seek to ﬁnd practical certiﬁcation strategies
that allow the beneﬁts of emerging AM technologies to be applied
without undue risk to safe aircraft or space vehicle operation.
These emerging protocols include a combination of:

tion of HIP to ameliorate the criticality of internal defects to

ture and anisotropy [59,101].

internal crack-like defects and based on minimum critical ﬂaw

2.6. Topology optimization & lattice structures
Topology optimization (TO) refers to a mathematical design
method often used to optimize material layout in structural appli-
cations for given boundary conditions and a given set of loads and
constraints [104]. The method is based on simulations and iterative
shape optimization, realized in different forms in commercial soft-
ware packages. Traditional TO utilizes the ﬁnite element method
(FEM) to improve design performance [104] and was ﬁrst popular-
ized by Bendsøe and Kikuchi in 1988 [105]. The method has seen
extensive development over the last three decades and has been
a popular topic of continued research and development, for all
manufacturing processes. It ﬁnds particular application in AM
due to the manufacturing freedoms of the AM technologies, allow-
ing optimization of shape and geometry for highly efﬁcient designs
with internal components and intricate features that are not feasi-
ble otherwise [106,107].
Lattice structures are porous cellular architectures that typically
refer to a network of solidly interconnected struts forming the
faces or edges of cells [108]. Cellular porous material architectures
are common in a wide variety of materials such as wood, bone,
metals, and other microscopic structures. The conventional manu-
facturing of cellular porous structures includes direct foaming,
spray foaming and vapour deposition techniques [109]. Both ran-
dom stochastic structures and periodic designs exist as low-
density cores in sandwich panel designs which are used in many
industries. Additively manufactured cellular structures (or lattice
structures) can mimic the geometry of these random stochastic
and periodic structures, on both the macro and micro scale, creat-
ing new opportunities for complex designs with unique properties
to be realized using the materials available for AM.
Metal lattice structures demonstrate high mechanical perfor-
mance, offering high speciﬁc strength, good energy absorption
capacity and robust thermal characteristics [110]. Periodic lattice
structures typically exhibit better performance characteristics with
respect to speciﬁc strength and energy absorption [111]. However,
these periodic lattice structures typically have manufacturing con-
straints and therefore higher costs over stochastic structures
[112,113]. L-PBF in particular can produce complex geometric
structures at a high resolution with limited ﬂaws and this shows
potential for the manufacture of both periodic and stochastic cellu-
lar lattice structures for excellent performance components, with
precisely controlled properties [114].
While these lattice structures allow for designs with interesting
lightweight, thermal, acoustic and energy absorption properties,
parameters for manufacturing still need to be improved to reduce
common issues such as strut micro-porosity, surface roughness
inconsistencies and poor mechanical properties that can occur
[112]. These manufacturing errors and the overall choice of cellular
geometry inﬂuence the fatigue performance of such structures,
which is key for their use in aerospace and is discussed in more
detail in [108].
2.7. Advantages of AM for aerospace applications
While the concept of lightweighting design exists in many
industries, aerospace industry applications are particularly well
explored due to the reduced fuel costs achieved through mass
reduction on aircraft and spacecraft. Recently, a speciﬁc focus on
the contributions of the aviation industry to the climate change
phenomenon and environmental pollution has prompted on-
going efforts to increase the energy efﬁciency of aircraft for the
reduction of emissions.
With the target of 50% reduced aviation emissions by 2050, the
International Civil Aviation Organization has invoked widespread
technology development in more efﬁcient aircraft systems. One
of the most effective methods of increasing the energy efﬁciency
of aircraft is through mass reduction techniques. For example,
reducing the mass of a Boeing 787 by 20% would improve the fuel
efﬁciency by between 10% and 12% all while improving the accel-
eration and other performance characteristics [115].
Additive manufacturing techniques have been shown to help
reduce cost and lead times and also for reducing the mass of com-
ponents aboard spacecraft and aircraft. Many popular publicized

examples of AM applications in aerospace boast mass reductions,
among many other beneﬁts. While this is an attribute that holds
much promise, lightweighting is currently still not the primary dri-
ver for AM in aerospace. Lead time reduction is currently the main
beneﬁt, which can be signiﬁcant for complex aerospace compo-
nents often taking months or years of (traditional) fabrication time
for complex systems. For example, the manufacturing freedoms
offered by using AM techniques to manufacture the A320 nacelle
hinge bracket, shown in Fig. 2, enabled the TO design to reduce
the CO2 emission for the entire operational lifecycle of the nacelle
hinges by 40% utilizing the mass reduction beneﬁts of AM and TO
[116]. The optimized design achieved a mass reduction of 64% from
the original component, although the use of Ti-6Al-4V instead of
the original HC101 steel accounts for about half of this mass
advantage [116].
Rotational components in aircraft and launch vehicle rocket
engines also beneﬁt highly from the application of lightweighting.
While the reduction in mass of these components decreases the
overall mass of aircraft and spacecraft, they have the added beneﬁt
of reducing rotational inertia which improves performance charac-
teristics such as starting torque reduction, braking torque reduc-
tion and a lower interaction moment between the rotational
components and the axle structures [118].
As demonstrated in [119], the potential for lightweighting of
structural components, rapid prototyping in the design chain and
complex designs of instrumentation hardware are all compelling
applications for AM in the space industry. With more recent
improvements in AM technology, new manufacturing opportuni-
ties have arisen for even the most technically demanding compo-
nents. The technology synergises with space applications serving
low quantities of components that exhibit mass and cost reduc-
tions crucial for increased development in space. With mission
costs for space exploration exceeding €20,000 per kilogram, every
gram saved translates to an increased payload capacity per launch
and a consequent reduction in launch costs [120].
Besides lightweighting, part consolidation is another prominent
beneﬁt for the application of AM techniques in aerospace applica-
tions with nearly every example displaying massive reductions in
part counts. Part consolidation, the act of consolidating multiple
components into one piece without assembly operations, has
widespread beneﬁts across all industries where it is applied. For
example, the Ariane 6 rocket injector head built through AM tech-
niques achieved a part consolidation count of 248 individual com-
ponents
manufactured
as
a
single component compared to
traditional manufacturing methods all while reducing the mass
of the injector head [121]. NASA has also demonstrated multiple
applications of AM to rocket engine injectors since 2013 that sig-
niﬁcantly reduce part count and lead time [62]. One such example
demonstrates a reduction from 115 parts to 2 parts and tested at
full operational conditions with high performance equivalent to
traditional manufacturing [122,123].
Part consolidation has the primary beneﬁts of reducing the
assembly operations and minimizing the usage of joining methods
such as bolting, welding, brazing, soldering and chemical bonding
methods [124]. Minimizing the use of these manufacturing meth-
ods in the production process drastically decreases the need for
skilled labour throughout resulting in cost reductions [125]. The
tooling necessary to manufacture components through traditional
manufacturing methods is also reduced by using part consolidation
through AM techniques. Another advantage is the reduced number
of components requiring certiﬁcation and associated documenta-
tion. Risk mitigation is inherent in component consolidation as
fewer joins and fewer processes are involved in the manufacturing
process. The certiﬁcation process is still a strict requirement
though with AM and is being evolved across various organizations.
Tooling for traditional manufacturing techniques typically
induces long lead times for manufacturing components and adds
signiﬁcant costs to the production process. AM techniques notably
reduce the need for tooling to manufacture components. This has
the beneﬁt of improving lead times for manufactured components
since tooling lines often take months, if not years, to set up. An
example of this is the Pratt & Whitney stator blades which claim
a lead time reduction of 15 months when compared to traditional
manufacturing methods all while reducing the mass of the blades
by 50% [126]. The design ﬂexibility of AM machines also allows
engineers to potentially manufacture multiple components on a
single machine, sometimes in the same build process. This enables
the tooling and assembly requirements to be reduced even further
since multiple, already part consolidated components can be man-
ufactured on a single machine. An example of a stator from a NASA
liquid oxygen (LOX) turbopump can be seen in Fig. 3, from [127].
Another beneﬁt to part consolidation is the reduced need for
warehousing for components and legacy components, including
components no longer available. Reducing part counts through
part consolidation directly reduces the need for large storage facil-
ities and cataloguing of components. Furthermore, manufacturing
and storing legacy stock components for future use is all but elim-
inated since AM machines can produce components from a digital
catalogue when they are needed. This is especially useful for
unpredictable maintenance related components and legacy com-
ponents that can be manufactured on demand, thereby eliminating
the need for stagnant production lines [128].
Heat transfer device applications have a strong potential to dis-
rupt traditional aerospace manufacturing processes by using AM
techniques, due to complex designs and internal features required.
Manufacturing these devices through AM allows for vast improve-
ments in part count reduction, lead time reduction, lightweighting
and cost reduction. For example, the GE9X heat exchanger boasts a

40% mass reduction, 25% cost reduction all while consolidating 163
components into a single part using AM techniques compared to
traditional manufacturing methods [129]. Manufacturing heat
transfer devices using AM also has performance beneﬁts when
compared to traditional manufacturing methods. As shown by
Saltzman et al [130], replicating a traditionally manufactured air-
craft oil cooler using AM techniques improved the heat transfer
performance by up to 15% due to the improved design with larger
surface area. Integrating heat transfer devices into structures and
other components also beneﬁts from the use of AM techniques.
As shown in [131], the incorporation of a thermal anti-ice system
into the structure of the leading edge of aircraft aerofoils has the
potential
to
improve
the
performance
of
anti-ice
systems.
Advanced complex high-performance components and structures
also see beneﬁcial applications in aerospace using AM. The manu-
facturing demonstrator AM rocket engine design by Cellcore,
shown in Fig. 4, demonstrates the ability to produce a complex
thrust chamber assembly in IN718 with integrated lattice internal
cooling channels [13,132].
NASA has established signiﬁcant use of AM for heat exchangers,
such as liquid rocket engine combustion chambers and channel-
cooled nozzles. Various applications have been reported including
combustion chambers using copper-alloys such as GRCop-42,
GRCop-42, C18150, and also Inconel 718 and Bimetallic Copper-
Superalloy structures that have accumulated over 30,000 s and
400 starts of hot-ﬁre time. Channel-cooled nozzles in various alloys
including JBK-75, NASA HR-1, Inconel 625, Haynes 230, and
bimetallic (Copper-Superalloy) structures have also been demon-
strated by NASA and accumulated over 11,000 s and 250+ hot-
ﬁre tests [133]. While these combustion chambers and nozzles
meet performance requirements, they also demonstrated signiﬁ-
cant cost and schedule savings for hardware delivery [134]. An
example of combustion chambers and nozzles for liquid rocket
engines can be seen in Fig. 5 [135–137].
Repairing
high-value
aerospace
components
using
AM
techniques also presents a major beneﬁt to AM applications in
aerospace. The high-performance components present in aero-
space applications such as impellers, turbine blades and airfoils
are typically expensive due to the use of high-value materials such
as Inconel and Titanium alloys. These components are often subject
to harsh environments such as corrosive environments, impact
events, thermal cycles and high stresses which all contribute to
reduced service life [138]. Traditionally these components were
repaired through welding processes which impart residual stress
formation and geometric distortion in the repaired components
[139,140]. Using AM techniques to repair aerospace components
has the beneﬁts of inducing a lower heat input during the repair
process compared to the traditional repair techniques and can
meet all structural design margins and operational conditions
when applied properly [141].
Hybrid manufacturing, i.e. combining AM with traditional man-
ufacturing methods is widely used in different permutations. One
good example is demonstrated in the AGENT-3D_IMProVe project,
where the Fraunhofer IWS team and project partner MTU Aero
Engines have developed a hybrid process chain using DED with
wire ﬁller material and conventional machining. The project
focuses on saving semi-ﬁnished product costs by reducing both
material quantities and machining times in order to cut tool costs.
This was achieved by way of precise AM using DED on the conven-
tionally produced substrate body. The project partners used a
nickel-based alloy (Inconel 718) as a wire ﬁller material. Several
other examples have been provided across aerospace including
bimetallic structures reported by Virgin Orbit and NASA to form
combustion chambers [142].
3. Distinct applications of AM in aerospace
3.1. Structures and brackets
Complex designs for AM of load bearing structures and brackets
are often unconventional, seemingly organic geometries with
exceptional strength to mass ratio characteristics. While these
can be applied successfully, a thorough understanding of full load
paths and environments must be well understood to take full

advantage of the technology. Metal AM enables the manufacture of
components of complex design within the build limits of the AM
technology being used, in a variety of materials and with different
design methodologies [143]. Brackets, structures, and frames are
common examples of applications for AM and TO in aerospace.
The production of organic lightweight structures was previously
performed by conventional manufacturing methods with serious
manufacturing constraints such as casting directions, symmetry,
size, and tool path limits. Compared to typical manufacturing tech-
niques, AM allows higher design complexities which can be uti-
lized fully through TO to further reduce the mass of components
in aerospace applications [115,144].
3.1.1. Aviation structures and brackets
The recent growth of metal AM and TO methods gave rise to a
host of new projects to potentially reduce the mass of components
by using TO together with AM without applying typical manufac-
turing constraints. The synergy of TO and AM techniques saw great
success throughout many aerospace application areas in recent
years [115,144]. One of the ﬁrst examples of a structural, TO, AM
component being used for the interior on a commercial aircraft is
the A350 cabin bracket connector. Airbus utilized TO and AM to
produce the bracket, as shown in Fig. 6, from Ti-6Al-4V using L-
PBF in 2014 [10,145,146].
A Norwegian company Norsk Titanium, in 2017, was the ﬁrst
company to receive approval from the FAA to manufacture AM
components, using DED techniques, that would experience in-
ﬂight stress loads [147]. These components, manufactured from
Ti-6Al-4V, were the ﬁrst structural AM components present on
the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Later in 2017, Airbus began production
and installation of a titanium critical support bracket to be used on
the A350 XWB. The component, manufactured via AM techniques,
is part of the aircraft pylon, the junction between the wings and
the engine [148].
A jointstudy between EOSand Airbus GroupInnovations wascar-
ried out on the Airbus A320 nacelle hinge bracket shown in Fig. 2
[116]. The component, to be manufactured from Ti-6Al-4V using L-
PBF techniques, is intended to replace the current hinge brackets
on the engine inspection nacelles with the goal of mass and cost
reduction over current designs [116]. This study showed that com-
pared to a conventional casting process, using L-PBF based AM tech-
niques produced distinct advantages in mass reduction [117].
Mass reduction techniques have seen widespread adoption in
the aerospace industry due to their inherent performance beneﬁts.
TO can be used as a powerful design tool for large scale structural
components of aircraft for overall shape and mass optimization,
when the appropriate environmental and combined loads are
known. An early and popular application of TO is seen in the design
of the A380 Droop Nose Ribs. Airbus UK, in partnership with Altair
Engineering, used compliance-based TO intending to provide more
stability to the existing Droop Nose Rib designs which resulted in a
shear-web and truss design [117].
Recent applications of TO adaptation have allowed for shape
preservation under given inputs which allow designers to optimize
both for mass and, for example, warping deformation [115,144]. A
good example of this is the cockpit windshield design. While the
front fuselage of an aircraft has much potential for TO for mass
reduction, damaging effects from bird strikes and extreme weather
conditions need to be mitigated [117]. A study was performed
which maintained warping deformation of the windshield to avoid
cracking by constraining the windshield local strain energies
[117,144]. The TO design with shape preservation dissipates the

strain energies on critical loading from the elements surrounding
the windshield [117,144]. The biggest challenges in incorporating
TO into the design and manufacturing workﬂow for aerospace
are the lack of well-deﬁned inputs for loads and constraints, and
the increased uncertainty in manufacturing quality for increasing
complexity components – an area that will see much future devel-
opment before AM techniques are used more routinely in aero-
space applications.
3.1.2. Spacecraft structures
The space industry commonly refers to economic activities
related to orbital launch vehicles, manufactured components that
go into Earth’s orbit and beyond and other related services [149].
The space industry has often been reliant on new, advanced tech-
nologies to continue to push exploration and new missions. As dis-
cussed in [119], early applications using AM showed potential
advantages in design and manufacturing for space applications.
The ﬁrst AM spacecraft structures were launched on the Juno mis-
sion to Jupiter in 2011. The components, a set of eight brackets,
were used to attach the waveguide, which is used to transmit radio
frequency signals between components [150]. Since then, AM tech-
nology continued to mature and conﬁdence in metal AM through-
out the aerospace industry increased signiﬁcantly resulting in AM
taking a larger role in the manufacturing of components for launch
vehicles and satellites [150,151]. The Sentinel satellites, a series of
earth observation missions from the European Space Agency (ESA),
set out to develop AM solutions for the latest editions of the mis-
sion, the Sentinel-1C and Sentinel-1D [139,140]. The Sentinel-1A
and Sentinel-1B, launched in 2014 and 2016 respectively, both uti-
lized conventional manufacturing techniques which allowed a set
of new brackets, developed by RUAG and Altair, produced using
AM techniques to be compared to the traditional design. Working
together with EOS and Altair, RUAG designed and produced an
optimized version of an existing Antenna bracket shown in Fig. 7
[139,140].
RUAG in collaboration with Altair then went on to design and
produce a star tracker camera bracket using TO and AM tech-
niques. The precursor bracket, manufactured using typical subtrac-
tive methods, saw mass reduction advantages using TO and AM on
the updated design. The bracket was manufactured in an EOS
M290 L-PBF machine from AlSi10Mg. The bracket, in its testing
conﬁguration shown in Fig. 8, underwent various testing proce-
dures such as Computed Tomography (CT) scans, geometric analy-
sis, tensile, microscopy and structural response testing [10].
The manufacturing of mirror components for satellite applica-
tions often push limits on several length scales. Besides the optical
or sensor devices, the corresponding supporting structures are
affected by high technical requirements as well. At the ESA L class
ATHENA (Advanced Telescope for High ENergy Astrophysics) mis-
sion, Silicon Pore Optics (SPO) need to be aligned and carried by a
supporting structure with a diameter of several meters. AM has
been used at Fraunhofer IWS to print those supporting structures
which require high process ﬂexibility and scalability. Tailored pro-
cesses and technologies are indispensable for overcoming the
accompanied manufacturing restraints. A hybrid AM process has
been developed in a cooperation between Fraunhofer IWS, ESA
and Airbus merging the high ﬂexibility of Laser Metal Deposition
(LMD), another name for LP-DED, with the precision of cryogenic
machining for the manufacturing of large volume titanium compo-
nents. So far a demonstrator of 1.5 m in diameter has been manu-
factured to demonstrate the feasibility of the whole process chain
for this application, shown in Fig. 9 [12].
3.1.3. Lattice structures
Recently, lattice structures have gained widespread interest
from engineers and scientists for their multi-faceted design advan-
tages [152]. Over the past decade, TO has seen commendation
among designers to optimize patterns of both meso-structures
and macro-structures, and sometimes including novel cellular (or
lattice) structures (CSs) [153]. While lattice designs previously
saw use in rectangular forms in heat exchangers and ﬁlter ele-
ments, it is now possible, using computational algorithms such
as TO, to design far more complex structures and internal geome-
tries using open-pored cellular / lattice structures [154]. While
there is a lot of potential for these structures, they have numerous
design and manufacturing constraints that need attention, limiting
their application so far, this is discussed in depth in [108].
CubeSats are types of miniaturized satellites designed to be
manufactured and deployed in a modular system which allows
for increased accessibility to space for small satellite manufactur-
ers. These satellites are designed to be both lightweight and small
enough to be carried as secondary payloads by satellite launch pro-
viders. Mass reduction of CubeSat structures presents the opportu-
nity to increase the number of small satellites per payload and
reduces the costs of launching these satellites to orbit. nTopology,
in collaboration with the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology
(AFIT), completed a case study on the application of AM and lattice
techniques for CubeSat bus structures. Built from Inconel 718 on a
L-PBF machine, the structure has the goals of reducing mass, part
count, lead times and increasing stiffness. The structure, shown
in Fig. 10, achieved a mass reduction of 50% and consolidated
150 components to less than 25 components which results in 6
times less possible failure locations [155].
Thales Alenia Space, in collaboration with the European Space
Agency (ESA), also used the combinations of AM, TO and lattice
structure techniques to develop a solar panel deployment mecha-
nism. The mechanism, intended for a satellite solar panel deploy-
ment application, uses TO to reduce the mass of the supporting
structure and then further reduces the mass by lattice insertion
techniques [156]. The structure, shown in Fig. 11a, reduced the
mass of the design by a factor of 5, the costs by a factor of 4, and
reduced the total component count by 10 through part consolida-

tion [156]. Another example of lattice use, in this case for thermal
application, is shown in Fig. 11b.
A collaborative project by Airbus, APWorks and Autodesk was
created with the task of reducing the mass of a partition wall of
the A320 series of aircraft. The Bionic Partition Project sought out
to utilize modern manufacturing techniques such as AM, TO and
lattice optimization to improve the partition design over existing
designs. The new partition used generative design similar to TO
to formulate an initial strut structure with the objectives of reduc-
ing mass while maintaining maximum displacement constraints
[158]. Further mass optimization was then applied by converting
the initial TO geometry to lattice beams, resulting in further mass
reduction [159].
Combinations of conventional manufacturing and AM tech-
niques present an interesting opportunity to reduce the impact
of imperfect parameterization currently in metal AM solutions.
Autodesk used both AM techniques and conventional metal casting
processes to produce a lightweight frame design for aircraft seats.
Using Autodesk’s Netfabb software package, the geometry for an
aircraft seat was produced using lattice and surface optimization,
algorithms similar to TO techniques. These technologies were com-
bined, producing positive molds for the seat frames containing
complex lattice geometry, printed in plastic to reduce costs and
time, and used to create ceramic casting molds in a similar method
to the ‘‘lost wax” process. Finally, the frame was cast in magnesium
allowing for the vast production quantities necessary for aircraft
seat manufacture [160,161].
An obvious but less widely reported application of cellular lat-
tice structures in metal AM is for internal ﬁll geometries of compo-
nents. TO techniques for AM applications can be further improved
by shelling components to further reduce the mass, but this pre-
sents the challenges of internal voids which require internal sup-
port
structures
for
any
overhanging
sections
and
can
trap
unprocessed powder increasing mass [108,112]. This challenge is
often solved by using internal lattice geometry in printed compo-
nents which replaces internal support structures with functional
cellular lattice structures with load-bearing capabilities [162].
However, these internal lattices often do not eliminate all the
unprocessed powder and holes need to be placed in a design to
release this powder. Fig. 12 demonstrates the applications of using
an internal lattice ﬁll to reduce internal mass. The branches of
internal macro lattice designs are usually designed such that their
angles did not exceed the minimum build angle of 45 common to
metal AM machines [118]. Such mass reductions on impeller com-
ponents
reduces
the
rotational
inertia
and
increases
the
performance.
3.2. Static and dynamic engine components
The static and rotational components present in both aircraft
and spacecraft rocket engines are subject to both extreme perfor-
mance requirements and harsh environments such as elevated
pressures, temperatures, and corrosive or embrittlement condi-
tions. These performance requirements often lead to highly com-
plex part geometries and special materials being used. Since
components such as compressor blades, turbine blades, inducers
and impellers have highly complex geometries, AM techniques

can be used to increase their performance [16]. As complexity
increases, traditional manufacturing techniques are limited by
their constraints and part complexity is effectively restricted. How-
ever, AM technology enables more designer freedom from geomet-
ric constraints commonly found using traditional manufacturing
techniques
allowing
for
more
intricate
ﬁnal
components
[138,97]. There are limitations of the AM process though in pro-
ducing some of these geometries in build angles and also rougher
surfaces than traditional machining. Typical build angle con-
straints limit overhangs to maximum 45 relative to the vertical,
with variation of surface roughness depending on the overhang
angle. Down-facing surfaces often have rougher surfaces with
excess material and irregular surface morphology. The build angle
change affects the local thermal history as underlying powder (in
powder bed fusion) does not conduct heat away, leading to higher
temperatures in these regions. The inclusion of support structures
may alleviate this and reduce the possibility for residual stress and
warping, but this requires post process support removal and this
may be difﬁcult in complex components. These and other limita-
tions are being solved incrementally by various researchers and
manufacturers, to improve the quality of metal AM components
to remove some design constraints.
An early case study in this domain was reported by Allison et al
in 2014 [163] showing the potential for AM applications on turbo-
machinery components such as an impeller. The impeller, manu-
factured from Inconel 718 using AM techniques, demonstrated
promising results functioning as predicted during testing. Interest-
ingly, during testing, the impeller test rig consisted of multiple
other components manufactured through AM techniques. Both
the inlet guide vane assembly and the aluminium volutes were
manufactured using SLS with Duraform HST and 3D-printed sand
casting molds respectively.
General Electric’s next-generation GE9X engine, which made its
maiden ﬂight in January 2020 aboard the new Boeing 777X, is the
largest and most powerful commercial jet engine ever produced
[164]. The GE9X, a high-bypass turbofan engine, features a large
number
of
additively
manufactured
components
integrated
directly into the core structure of the engine. Notably, 228 low-
pressure turbine blades are manufactured from TiAl using EB-PBF
manufacturing techniques for each engine with the express goal
of mass reduction [129].
A case study by Siemens highlights the manufacturability of
turbomachinery by the means of AM. Siemens, after initial
investments in AM in 2009, installed their ﬁrst AM components
in gas turbines in 2013, began to work on hot gas path blades
which were successfully printed and installed in 2017. They then
went on to assess the viability of commercial applications of
closed radial impeller wheels for turbo-compressors using AM
techniques such as L-PBF and EB-PBF. Depending on successful
testing and regulatory approval, the radial impeller wheels show
promising results to improve the efﬁciency of turbomachinery
[165]. While these are not directly aerospace examples, they
are a good indication of the potential and capability for high per-
formance components.
Engine maker Pratt & Whitney has produced more than 100,000
prototype components using AM over the last 25 years and cur-
rently produces compressor stator blades and ring synch brackets
for the PW1500G engines which are part of the Bombardier C Ser-
ies aircraft. These stator blades are used to guide airﬂow through
the compressor of aircraft engines [126].
While still in their infancy, lattice structures are gaining interest
into turbomachinery components to increase performance. A
recent study done by [118] demonstrates the application of inter-
nal lattice structures on compressor impellers to reduce the mass
and moment of inertia. Manufactured using AM with Ti-6Al-4V,
the internal lattice impeller design attempts to both improve the
performance of the impeller, and the AM manufacturing process
by reducing residual stress build up in the printing process.

Large modern aircraft engines typically consist of tens of thou-
sands of components and, while not all components are feasible to
manufacture through AM techniques, many components besides
the core turbine and compressor blades can be reasonable applica-
tions for AM. Honeywell Aerospace completed a study into various
turbomachinery components for applications in their HTF7000 ser-
ies of aircraft engines. The study details not only high-pressure tur-
bine applications for AM but also designs for a tangential on-board
injector, a second stage high-pressure turbine nozzle, an atomizer
shroud, an inlet booster rake, and an engine mount. This demon-
strates that a large quantity of aircraft engine components have
the potential to be manufactured using AM [166].
Probably the most well-known AM component application in
aerospace is the General Electric LEAP engine fuel nozzle. Begin-
ning production in 2015, over 30 000 nozzles were produced by
the year 2018 and it is still in production [167]. Utilizing L-PBF
with a Cobalt-Chrome alloy, the fuel nozzle, shown in Fig. 13, is
installed on multiple engines currently in service on commercial
aircraft.
After the success of the LEAP engine fuel nozzle, GE then went
on to produce a myriad of AM components for the new GE9X
engine series [129]. The GE9X engine boasts 304 additively manu-
factured components across seven multi-part assemblies resulting
in over one-third of the components on the GE9X series engines
being produced using AM techniques. The engine will feature 28
of the LEAP engine fuel nozzles, 228 low-pressure turbine blades,
a T25 sensor housing, a combustion mixer, 8 cyclonic inducers
and a heat exchanger all manufactured using AM. All these compo-
nents, except for the LPT blades and the heat exchanger, are man-
ufactured
from
a
Cobalt-Chrome
(Co-Cr)
alloy
using
L-PBF
processes.
DED is being used to fabricate overhanging large scale metal
structures. These structures can be built through multi-axis orien-
tation systems that orientate the constructed component so that
layers are always built with no overhangs. A ﬁve-axis DED system
produced by The Welding Institute (TWI) is used in the production
of an Inconel 718 helicopter engine combustion chamber with
effective overhang angle constraints of close to 90 [97,168].
Additive manufacturing techniques have been extensively
applied to repair existing components [97]. Damaged components
can be repaired using AM instead of replacing and scrapping them,
this can result in signiﬁcant cost savings for expensive components
commonly found in aerospace applications, not only for saving on
the cost of new components but also on the requirements for spare
components inventories and new part manufacturing lead time
savings [169]. This is also relevant to legacy and aging aircraft for
which components might not be available at all. Further studies
have shown that restoration through AM has, compared to tradi-
tional methods, a substantially lower environmental footprint
[170]. Restoring the structural integrity of integrally bladed rotors,
also known as Blisks, provides cost-effectiveness since these com-
ponents can cost tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars to
manufacture. The T700 Blisk, made from AM355 steel suffers from
erosion on its leading edge. This led to a case study by Optomec
which utilized Stellite 21, an erosion-resistant cobalt-based mate-
rial to repair the leading edge. Passing spin and low-cycle fatigue
tests, the repaired blisk showed positive metallurgical, tensile
and erosion qualities enabling its certiﬁcation [171]. Fig. 14 shows
the repair process using LENS AM (LENS is a DED process) where
(A) shows the LENS system repair process, (B) shows the T700 blisk
after leading-edge repair and (C) shows the repaired blisk after ﬁn-
ishing [171,172].
The ability to produce impeller and airfoil components through
the use of DED processes with high-quality mechanical properties
compared to typical manufacturing techniques was demonstrated
in [173]. They illustrate the ability of DED to repair turbine blades
and a fuel nozzle swirler using Inconel-718, which is usually a dif-
ﬁcult material to deposit using typical welding processes or laser
deposition processes without causing cracks [173].
Complex turbomachinery has been demonstrated in various
applications by NASA [174–177]. Impellers, pump volutes, turbine
blisks, turbine stators, turbine exit guide vanes, and the turbine
nozzle have all been demonstrated for an AM liquid rocket engine
within a liquid hydrogen fuel (LH2) and liquid oxidizer (LOX) tur-
bopumps (see Fig. 15). The liquid hydrogen fuel turbopump was
successfully manufactured with 45 percent fewer parts than tradi-
tional manufacturing and completed spin and engine testing oper-
ating at more than 90,000 revolutions per minute. A LOX pump
demonstrated the use of AM within relevant test environments
as well. It was noted that process improvements were required
for these AM components include surface ﬁnishing, material prop-
erties, application of support structures during build, and dimen-
sional tolerances [178].
3.3. Thermal devices
Advanced heat transfer devices manufactured employing AM
techniques have strong potential to reduce manufacturing time
and improve the performance characteristics of heat exchangers
(HXs), heat sinks (HSs) and heat pipes (HPs) mainly when used
to manufacture complex free-form internal geometries [179]. In
particular, HXs are crucial for components in aerospace applica-
tions such as the performance of aircraft and spacecraft engines,
while HSs are typically used in crucial electronic applications pre-
sent on both aircraft electronics and spacecraft electronics. Con-
ventional manufacturing techniques for HXs and HSs typically
include brazing techniques and CNC milling techniques respec-
tively [180]. While brazing is an effective manufacturing method
for HXs, it typically consists of a high amount of time-consuming
skilled labour work, high tolerances for achieving reasonable gaps
in joining, and often expensive materials which increases the cost
of components. Furthermore, HSs are limited by the complexity
achievable through the use of CNC milling techniques. For these
reasons, AM techniques are being used to improve the perfor-
mance of HXs and HSs by increasing their complexity and provid-
ing ﬂexibility for designers to improve the surface area to volume
ratios, all while eliminating the brazing process. Moreover, brazing
techniques are typically limited to the materials compatible with
the process while AM allows for a wider variety of materials to
be used on these devices, although new material developments
are a signiﬁcant growth opportunity for AM. Gobetz et al,
performed a study to demonstrate the feasibility of using AM

techniques in a heat exchanger for aerospace applications with the
goals of more direct manufacturing as opposed to the traditional
manufacturing and assembly techniques present in current appli-
cations of HXs. Built from Al-10Si-0.5 Mg on an EOS M280 L-PBF
machine, the HX functioned effectively under an air-to-air testing
setup after successful manufacturing [181].
A case study done by [130] highlights the ability for AM to be
utilized on typical aircraft HX applications. The study compares
the AM HX functionality relative to conventionally manufactured
HX components with an example of an aircraft oil cooler. The
component in question was manufactured as a direct copy of
an existing conventionally manufactured HX. Using L-PBF tech-
niques, the component was realized with AlSi10Mg. Although
the AM manufacturing process produced some defects in the
component, under testing the AM component performed signiﬁ-
cantly better than the baseline, conventionally manufactured
component demonstrating the functionality of AM HX in realistic
applications.
More notably, General Electric has incorporated an AM HX into
their latest GE9X engine series currently in operation [129]. Man-
ufactured from Aluminium alloy (F357) on an L-PBF machine, the
HX functions as a vital component in the engine with the goals
of reducing size, reducing mass, reducing costs, and improving
durability.
NASA’s latest mission to Mars saw the delivery of yet another
rover to Martian soil. The rover, called Perseverance, has the task
of ﬁnding signs of ancient life and to collect samples of regolith
and rock for future return missions to Earth. The rover, which
landed on Mars in February 2021, carries 11 components fabri-
cated using metal AM techniques. Of these 11 components, 6 are
AM built heat exchangers used in the Mars Oxygen In-Situ
Resource Utilization Experiment, or MOXIE. These heat exchangers
are exposed to the Martian atmosphere and have to withstand
temperatures of over 800 Celsius for extended periods of time.
This resulted in nickel-based superalloys being used for the heat
exchanger structures which simpliﬁed and improved the capabili-
ties of the MOXIE system compared to if they were built using con-
ventional
techniques.
Besides
the
6
heat
exchangers,
the
Perseverance rover features 5 other AM built components on its
Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry, or PIXL. To reduce
the mass of the PIXL, AM was used to fabricate a two-piece tita-
nium shell, a mounting frame and two supporting struts which
all resulted between 3 and 4 times less mass compared to compo-
nents manufactured through traditional methods [182].
Since AM techniques provide an unprecedented amount of
complexity in components compared to traditional manufacturing
methods, often there are limitations on design capability to fully
optimize devices such as HXs and HSs. Optimization tools are

gaining traction for their application in HXs and HSs through the
application of AM techniques in the form of thermal TO methods.
A paper by de Bock et al [183] exhibits the potential performance
of using hybrid analytical thermal TO (HAATO) on an HS applica-
tion. While still in their infancy, these optimization techniques
have the potential to drastically increase the performance of HSs
and HXs by increasing their geometric complexity. Fig. 16 displays
the incredible internal complexity of their AM HX designs intended
for motorsport applications [184]. The highly complex structure is
optimized for large surface area, enhancing the heat exchange.
While this is not an aerospace example, the principles and advan-
tages are the same for aerospace components.
Examples of internal cooling channels are present in cylinder
blocks of internal combustion engines and internal cooling chan-
nels in high-pressure turbine blades in aircraft. These integrated
systems are generally constrained by typical manufacturing tech-
niques such as joining, brazing, casting, and CNC milling processes.
AM techniques offer vastly more design complexity for these com-
ponents for placement options for internal cooling channels and
micro-lattice structures and related designs. Cobra Aero, a small
UAV designer and manufacturer, sought out to improve their
UAV engine using AM, optimization techniques and lattice struc-
tures with the goals of reducing mass and optimizing heat transfer
characteristics [185]. Using AM, they produced a cylinder block
leveraging multi-physics simulations which accounted for thermal,
ﬂow characteristics, stress and pressure factors resulting in an
optimally designed cylinder block that was more thermally efﬁ-
cient than designs realised through conventional manufacturing
methods (Fig. 17).
Thermal anti-ice is a widely used anti-ice system present on
commercial aircraft that limits the ice build-up on the leading
edges of aircraft airfoils. Bici et al [131] explored the application
of lattice structures to a multi-functional panel intended for this
application. The design focusses on a single piece airfoil, manufac-
tured via AM techniques, with an internal lattice structure that dis-
tributes hot air to the leading edge of the airfoil to prevent ice
build-up. Furthermore, the design mitigates structural stresses by
using lattice structures to reduce the mass of the leading edge.
HiETA, an engineering company based in the United Kingdom,
uses AM techniques such as L-PBF to produce a variety of products
for the aerospace market with a particular focus on heat exchang-
ing and cooling devices [186]. In particular, they produce an inter-
nally
cooled
radial
turbine
wheel
and
housing
using
AM
techniques. The turbine wheel, manufactured from CM247 LC or
Inconel alloys, features complex internal cooling channels that
enable higher operating temperatures for turbine engine applica-
tions all while reducing the mass of components.
3.4. Liquid fuel rocket components
Space-based activities have seen rapid increases over the last
two decades in the form of space exploration, scientiﬁc endeav-
ours, communication satellites, earth-observation satellites, per-
manent human presence on the International Space Station (ISS)
and many other missions. All this increased activity has been
assisted by programs such as NASA’s Artemis program and many
private companies entering the orbital launch capabilities market
[187–189]. With so much competition among launch providers,
innovation has soared and advanced manufacturing techniques
such as AM are widespread among space launch systems and satel-
lites. Satellites, space stations and space launch systems boast the
most expensive man-made objects in existence with the ISS cost-
ing $160 Billion alone and more sections are still being added
[190]. The beneﬁts of AM in cost reduction compared to conven-
tional manufacturing methods has the potential to make space-
based activities more accessible.
As launch systems provide the infrastructure to access space,
the efﬁciency of these systems is vital to reducing costs for all
space-based systems. At the core of these systems is the Liquid
Fuel Rocket Engine which is widely used in most launch vehicle
applications. This complexity is leveraged through the use of AM
techniques in more modern rocket launch systems to increase
the performance of the system. With unofﬁcial reports suggesting
the in-development SpaceX Raptor engine contains as much as 40%
by-mass AM fabricated components [191], space launch systems
are proving to be one of the primary applications for AM built
components.
Injector systems on rocket engines typically consist of hundreds
of individually manufactured components which are then brazed
or welded into a single injector head [121]. These injector heads
are generally time-consuming and expensive to manufacture
through traditional manufacturing techniques. However, AM tech-
niques can be employed to drastically reduce the cost and time
needed to manufacture these injector components. Ariane 6, set
to be launched in 2020, is the latest rocket in production by the
Ariane Group and as part of their RAMS (Reliability, Availability,
Maintainability and Safety) guidelines, they are looking for innova-
tive manufacturing solutions. With an overall goal of 40–50% lower
production costs over the Ariane 5, AM was employed throughout
the project for increased cost efﬁciency and performance [121].
This injector core was produced with Inconel 718 on an EOS M
400–4 system utilizing 4-laser technology to rapidly decrease pro-
duction time. The injector core is shown in Fig. 18.
Copenhagen Suborbitals, an entirely crowdfunded and non-
proﬁt space company, has been assessing the feasibility of utilizing
AM components into their workﬂow to reduce costs [192]. Their
latest AM case study, swirlers for a coaxial swirl injector, have been
manufactured using Digital Metal’s proprietary binder jetting
metal AM technique. A project was completed by DLR, a German
Aerospace Centre, also involving coaxial injector applications of
AM in aerospace [193]. The project was based on a small satellite
launch vehicle (SSLV) program with the aims of reducing costs to
orbit for small satellite producers. After being manufactured using
L-PBF techniques, the injector was tested successfully showing
good performance characteristics and is set to pave the way for fur-
ther development at DLR. NASA has also demonstrated and
reported hundreds of successful injector hot ﬁre tests in a variety
of fuels for liquid rocket engine applications [62].
At NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in Alabama,
much research and development is being performed into AM appli-
cations for rocket engine components. NASA, in collaboration with
Stratasys Direct Manufacturing, developed and tested an injector
system using L-PBF AM techniques [194]. The injector, manufac-
tured out of Inconel 625, allowed for unique ﬂow characteristics

only achievable through AM technologies. The MSFC then went on
to manufacture and test a demonstrator rocket engine that was
comprised of 75 percent AM built components [194]. NASA has
since developed and tested a myriad of AM components since
2010 such as copper alloy (GRCop-42 and GRCop-84) combustion
chambers, liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen fuel pumps, mainte-
nance port cover on J-2X and the pogo accumulator assembly with
integral pogo z-bafﬂe [195]. Some of these components are set to
be installed on the upcoming RS-25 liquid rocket engines respec-
tively under the Space Launch System (SLS).
Aerojet Rocketdyne, an American rocket and missile propulsion
manufacturer, has also been evaluating applications of AM in their
new line of rocket engines, the AR-1 series. Intended to replace the
currently used Russian-made RD-180 engine, the AR-1 utilizes AM
methods for its pre-burner. The pre-burner is manufactured from
MondaloyTM, a proprietary burn resistant nickel-based superalloy
which eliminates the need for elaborate metal coating processes
currently in use on oxygen-rich engines such as the RD-180
[196]. This is not the ﬁrst component Aerojet Rocketdyne has man-
ufactured and tested using AM techniques. In 2017, the space com-
pany manufactured and tested a copper combustion chamber for
their RL-10 rocket engine using AM and has developed signiﬁcant
qualiﬁcation criteria for AM in space applications [197].
Arianne group recently manufactured and completed hot-ﬁre
testing of a full scale, demonstrator rocket engine with AM built
components integrated. The engine featured a L-PBF built injector
head and combustion chamber using the materials of a nickel-
based alloy and stainless steel respectively [198]. As part of the Ari-
anne 6 development program, these new AM built components are
set to ﬂy aboard the new variant of the Arianne rocket family in
2022.
Additive manufacturing applications are sometimes limited by
the build area constraints of the L-PBF based machines which can
only produce components as large as their maximum build volume
(typically 300–600 mm cubed for single-laser commercial systems,
although larger systems are in development). Built under conven-
tional manufacturing conditions, rocket fuel tanks and aircraft
fuselages are often built in several sections using thin-skinned sup-
ported structure designs called Isogrid [199]. The process of tradi-
tionally manufacturing these structures generates a lot of material
waste in space structure applications since entire Isogrid designs
are commonly machined, using milling techniques, from a thicker
plate of stock material. This process results in extremely expensive
components due to the high wastage of stock material and the
long-lead plate stock material needed for larger rocket fuselages.
Since DED techniques are not limited by size, larger liquid fuel
rocket components have recently seen development using DED. A
speciﬁc application area is to use DED to manufacture entire fuel
tanks, which typically also act as the structure for rockets. Using
DED techniques, it may be possible to print entire rocket fuel tanks
in a single piece or far fewer pieces with signiﬁcantly less material
wastage and much fewer tooling requirements which could signif-
icantly reduce the costs of these components. Lockheed Martin
recently developed and tested a titanium dome for satellite fuel
tanks built using EB-DED. The 1.16-meter diameter domes serve
as caps for variable size fuel tanks aboard the LM 2100 satellite
buses currently in production. Using these manufacturing tech-
niques, Lockheed Martin is saving valuable production schedule
time all while reducing material wastage signiﬁcantly [200]. Rela-
tivity Space, an American aerospace company, plans to build their
entire Terran 1 rocket using AM techniques from a proprietary
alloy. Notably, the company plans to build the 2-meter diameter,
dual-purpose fuel tank and fuselage using AW-DED, signiﬁcantly
reducing wasted materials and has demonstrated and ground
tested pathﬁnder units [201]. With no theoretical limits to the
height of components being produced using these methods, the
component could potentially span the entire fuel tank section
which is over 10 m tall.
SpaceX, after successfully developing and launching an AM built
main oxidiser valve aboard their Falcon 9 rocket, went on to
develop the SuperDraco engine series that is used in their Dragon
V2 spacecraft [202]. The SuperDraco engines are used for the
mission-critical launch escape system designed to carry astronauts
to safety if an emergency occurs during the launch sequence of the
Dragon spacecraft. Featuring an AM built engine chamber made of
Inconel, the SuperDraco is one of the earliest applications of crucial
AM built components aboard human-occupied spacecraft which
has had two successful missions launching astronauts to the ISS
on the Demo-2 and Crew-1 missions [203]. Fig. 19 shows the
assembled Superdraco rocket engine and the engine on a testing
stand in a hot-ﬁre test.

aerospace company, RocketLab. The company, a small satellite
launch provider, has used AM technology to manufacture all of
their primary rocket engine components aboard their Rutherford
rocket engine since 2013. Aboard their Electron launch vehicle,
the Rutherford rocket engine features a combustion chamber,
injector, pumps, and main propellant valves among other compo-
nents all manufactured using EB-PBF techniques and has been
tested, manufactured, and launched on 18 missions to date [206].
Usually built using multiple materials and thousands of compo-
nents, the combustion chamber, nozzle, and injector assemblies
have garnered much interest recently for AM applications of
single-piece manufacturing. An example of AM techniques being
used for single-piece manufacturing is the Aeon 1 rocket engine
built by Relativity Space. The Aeon 1 engine, to be launched on
the upcoming Terran 1 launch vehicle, features its injector, ignitor,
combustion chamber and nozzle all manufactured as a single com-
ponent using AM techniques [207]. Another company, the New
York-based Launcher Inc., plans to build the highest performance
rocket engine in the small satellite launcher class using predomi-
nantly AM built components. Their rocket engine, the E-2, will be
the largest single part combustion chamber, injector and nozzle
assembly all built using L-PBF techniques from a C18150 (Cu-Cr-
Zr) alloy [208].
More recently, NASA has been developing new materials and
application areas for AM for liquid fuel rocket engine components
using a variety of AM methods. Prominent examples of this are
development under NASA’s Rapid Analysis and Manufacturing
Propulsion (RAMPT) project and Space Launch System (SLS) pro-
jects evaluating new materials, GRCop-42 and NASA HR-1 devel-
oped at NASA’s Glenn Research Center (GRC) and NASA MSFC,
respectively.
These
materials,
namely
the
GRCop-series
of
copper-chrome-niobium alloys and iron-nickel NASA HR-1 super-
alloy, were developed primarily for rocket combustion chamber
and nozzle applications using AM. A 7k-lbf coupled-design features
a GRCop-42 (Cu-4 at.% Cr-2 at.% Nb) L-PBF built combustion cham-
ber with integral channels and a NASA HR-1 LP-DED integrated
nozzle built directly onto the chamber to eliminate the manifold
and joint. Combining these AM techniques and materials allows
for tailored material characteristics in the combustion chamber,
nozzle, and integrated cooling channels which could improve the
performance and reduce mass of rocket engines substantially while
using AM techniques. The 40k, shown in Fig. 20c, is built using a L-
PBF GRCop-42 combustion chamber liner and a DED HR-1 jacket
[209].
NASA has also demonstrated many applications of large scale
DED, speciﬁcally LP-DED. The focus at NASA has been rocket engine
components, such as large scale channel wall nozzles and power-
head components. The nozzle has design similarities to combus-
tion chambers with ﬁne feature channels being incorporated to
eliminate braze joints and extensive tooling often involved during
assembly. NASA MSFC along with industry partners recently
demonstrated a 65% scale RS-25 engine integral channel LP-DED
nozzle at 1.52 m in diameter and 1.78 m in height [210]. Prior noz-
zles were also demonstrated with LP-DED integral channel features
at smaller scales and several completed hot-ﬁre testing with high
duty cycles [47,211]. The nozzles demonstrate the potential to
reduce part counts of the traditionally built nozzles from over
1100 components to fewer than 10 components on full-scale
designs [212]. Other components have been demonstrated using
LP-DED including various large scale manifolds and complex com-
ponents such as the RS-25 powerhead half shells. Many of these
components were typically fabricated using forgings or castings
with extensive machining operations and have shown signiﬁcant
cost and schedule savings with short deposition times using DED.
Examples of these components can be seen in Fig. 21.
Recently, there have been investigations in the use of AM and
lattice structures in rocket nozzle components. Thrust chamber
assemblies see various integrated mechanical, thermal, and inte-
grated environments loads which presents difﬁculties in optimiza-
tion. A collaboration between Cellcore and SLM Solutions produced
an integrated thrust chamber design utilizing L-PBF to show poten-
tial applications in the aerospace industry [13]. The thrust cham-
ber, as seen in Fig. 4, features a structural lattice in its walls
which has a second purpose as the cooling jacket for the engine.
The one-piece engine is manufactured in just over three days on
an SLM 280 printer. The design uses Inconel 718, a particularly dif-
ﬁcult to machine material, and features very little post-processing
avoiding costly tool wear, saving considerable costs while produc-
ing an extremely lightweight structure. The design also features a
fully integrated injector further reducing the total part count and
complexity of the ﬁnal rocket design [132]. While this design
shows an example of the potential integration of multiple parts,
the overall loads must be well understood in the full environment
to incorporate TO and also the entire AM process, including post-
processing for successful application.
Due to the complexity present in the regenerative cooling chan-
nels of most rocket engines, thermal and structural optimization
techniques have been gaining interest in applications for rocket
engine designs. In one example, Hyperganic, a developer of AI-
driven design software similar to TO, demonstrated optimization
applications
on
a concept
rocket
nozzle using
a
top-down
approach, integrating several components such as the combustion
chamber, nozzle, and cooling channels into one single component
[213]. The nozzle is designed to be printed using metal AM tech-
niques allowing for a high complexity in design. The prototype,
shown in Fig. 22, is designed to be manufactured from Inconel
718 on an EOS M400-4 printer. The nozzle features a gyroid mini-
mal surface lattice design on its outer surface. These lattice struc-
tures are found in nature and are often self-supporting and feature
zero average curvature at any point on their surface, making for
more even distribution of stresses within the structures [112].
These examples demonstrate some of the potential, but these
designs are still not widely tested or adopted in ﬂight components
and currently are still in design and proof of concept phases.

industry. Table 2 and Table 3 present a collection of prominent
examples appearing in non-technical literature (Table 2) and a
comprehensive list of articles, books, reviews, and conference pro-
ceedings appearing in technical literature (Table 3) in recent years.
Table 2**** alphabetically lists the company involved, the applica-
tion, the design approach, the material used, technology used and
reference for further reading. Table 3 chronologically lists the stud-
ies and includes information on the author/s, the title, the applica-
tion area, the publication year, and reference for further reading.
4. Challenges and opportunities
4.1. Overview
Metal AM technologies show great potential for technical and
commercial advantages for aerospace applications, as is evident
from the applications reviewed in the previous sections. Despite
the technical and commercial opportunities enabled by metal
AM, these technologies are subject to unique challenges for imple-
mentation in aerospace applications. This section highlights some
of the current major challenges and some future opportunities.

4.2. Certiﬁcation & standards
A major current challenge is the lack of technological standards
and certiﬁcation approaches present for metal AM in the aerospace
industry, which is caused by the rapid growth in AM technologies
over the last decade. These standards need to be reﬁned and agreed
upon across industry to assure the repeatability, reliability and
quality of AM components for aerospace sector applications. Major
governing bodies such as the European Union Aviation Safety
Agency (EASA), NASA, European Space Agency (ESA), and Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) are imposing increasingly strict
testing protocols and certiﬁcations that are required for the use
of aerospace components in service for both mission-critical and
non-critical applications [99]. These certiﬁcation processes gener-
ally involve the repeatability of production processes and consis-
tency in the quality of manufactured components which are both
considerable challenges currently in the metal AM industry, espe-
cially when producing components in larger quantities. The pri-
mary
challenge
for
the
certiﬁcation
process
of
AM
built
components is the lack of prior knowledge, complete understand-
ing and traceability of the AM process, detailed characterization
and AM property databases, and data regarding the failure mecha-
nisms. While materials with traditional processes are well under-
stood and signiﬁcant databases exist, AM materials lack a large
database and agreed upon properties. Currently, ISO and ASTM
develop a range of AM standards, described in more detail in
[14]; these standards are evolving, and new standards are emerg-
ing, to accommodate the certiﬁcation and design requirements
for AM applications in the aerospace sector. A list of relevant cur-
rent certiﬁcation-related standards is provided in Table 4.
4.3. Structural integrity
Structural integrity is of paramount importance for mission-
critical aerospace applications and integrity includes dynamic
loading in both high cycle and low cycle modes, thermal cycling
and impact loading. Fatigue response to dynamic loading is of par-
ticular concern for AM aerospace applications. The static mechan-
ical properties of metallic AM built components are relatively well
researched, with hardness and strength matching and exceeding
that of traditionally manufactured material properties [77–80].
However, dynamic mechanical properties such as fatigue and creep
have seen relatively less research and there remains a lack of test
data reporting among aerospace companies [40]. The existing AM
fatigue literature demonstrates test results that indicate porosity,
residual stress and surface roughness are the largest concerns for
high cycle fatigue (HCF) and low cycle fatigue (LCF) testing scenar-
ios with overall fatigue properties generally substandard compared
to conventional manufacturing processes [34,40,41]. Much pro-
gress has been made in mitigating these issues, allowing the
improved performance of components with minimized defects,
and achieving mechanical performance (including fatigue perfor-
mance) on par with traditional manufacturing techniques [14].
Residual stress during AM builds result in possible part warp-
ing, cracking and reduced mechanical properties, and this build-
up depends on the material used, the process parameters used,
and the geometry and orientation in the build chamber, amongst
other factors (speciﬁc thermal histories during the build). Simi-
larly, porosity formation is strongly dependent on the process
parameters as well as on local changes during the build. Various
mechanisms for porosity formation in metal AM have been identi-
ﬁed, which result in lack of fusion and keyhole porosity, with vary-
ing extent and 3D distributions depending on various factors [344–
347]. The presence of porosity reduces the ductility of the material
but is especially critical in fatigue loading as pores can act as stress
concentrators and hence crack initiation locations, resulting in pre-
mature failures [348–350]. The surface roughness of the as-built
components are generally irregular and vary with build orienta-
tion, process parameters and other factors – these also act as stress
concentrators and crack initiation locations [100]. The obtained
material microstructure is often anisotropic and the grain orienta-
tion depends on the building direction, affecting the mechanical
properties. Appropriate post-process heat treatments and HIP are
required to improve this.

All of these manufacturing-speciﬁc defects remain an issue to
actively mitigate and be cognizant of, and therefore require exten-
sive quality control across all stages of the AM process, from pow-
der feedstock to ambient gas purity, process parameter control,
process optimization, in-situ monitoring and post-processing for
each individual process and feedstock combination required.
Despite optimal processes and material quality, unexpected errors
may still occur which require post-process inspection and often
some kind of machining and further post processing is needed.
All of these operations add cost to the produced components, but
bypassing these steps leads to a loss in performance and reliability.
HIP has been widely adopted in aerospace, and in AM in particular
it is very useful for closing pores [101], homogenizing the
microstructure, and improving the ductility of components. This
also leads to greatly improved fatigue performance of metal AM
components [351,352], leading to its wide adoption in aerospace
manufacturing [34].
4.4. Design for AM
Design for AM (DfAM) can be used to optimize the design for
the best manufacturing quality, minimizing support structures
and post processing requirements [143]. This can also be done in
combination with build simulations to determine optimal orienta-
tion of the part on the build platform, help determine build strate-
gies to minimize residual stresses and resulting distortion, and
minimizing support structures. Such simulations and DfAM meth-
ods are time consuming and dependant on the engineering skill of
the AM engineer, and on the computing power of the computer
used, but may be necessary. Simulations also require well deﬁned

inputs such as alloy mechanical and thermophysical properties
often at the liquidus and solidus temperatures, which is not always
available [353–355].
While TO and lattice structures are discussed there are several
challenges that exists with these in practical application. Since
these techniques often optimize the design based on a known set
of inputs and constraints, the load paths for aerospace components
must be well understood. These load paths and combined struc-
tural, thermal, dynamic, and integrated environments are not
always well deﬁned or known for aerospace applications and
designs can often include high design margins to account for these
uncertainties.
4.5. Powder removal & post processing
Post-processing is a critical step in metal AM that is often
underestimated. For complex parts with ﬁne feature sizes, trapped
powders can be a challenge to remove. This is compounded by the
difﬁculty in handling such powders due to safety concerns. Typical
approaches involve rotational movements, tapping and blowing
powders out of surface cavities and channels. Trapped powders
can be observed in CT scans, but may be permanently trapped if
not removed prior to heat treatment.
Further post-processing steps might involve support removal,
surface ﬁnishing and other heat treatments. For all post processing
steps, care must be taken to prevent damage (e.g. when removing
supports) to ensure the part conforms to the design and does not
include surface damage. Surface polishing, machining or other pro-
cessing is further challenged as AM part complexity increase and
must be carefully designed for early in the process.
4.6. Non-Destructive testing (NDT)
Due to the many challenges described before, NDT is prescribed
for all critical ﬂightcomponents manufactured by metal AM. Various
NDT methods used are described in detail in [356]. NDT is important
for identifying ﬂaws such as porosity or cracks in critical compo-
nents and a variety of methods may be used including radiographic
testing (RT), dye penetrant, eddy current, ultrasonic testing,
amongst others. Some of the new challenges in this type of NDT
for AM parts is that the complexity of the parts requires more chal-
lenging NDT approaches and some traditional tools are not relevant
to such complex parts. In addition, the inherent surface roughness
reduces the sensitivity of some traditional NDT tools. Despite these
challenges, one method has proven to be able to overcome many of
these challenges: X-ray computed tomography (CT). This method
has been demonstrated to be successful for inspection of cracks,
pores, trapped powders, deviation from design geometry, warping
due to thermal processing, and more [103]. One particular advan-
tage of the method is the ability to provide information on the
changes in a part over time, with multiple scans at different times,
providing information on crack formation or the extent of wear or
other damage that can occur. The dimensional evaluation provided
can be used to assess suitability for further use and even provide pre-
dictions of further life expectancy.
The major limitations of the technique are the relatively poor res-
olution for large parts, components with thick walls, challenges with
alloys such as copper, and the time and cost involved. In addition,
somemetals arehighlyabsorbing forX-rays, making theirCT ineffec-
tive except for very small parts. In these cases the use of smaller cou-
pon samples are recommended for checking process optimization
conditions [346] and witness specimens built alongside larger parts
give a good indication of the quality of the build [357]. For larger
parts, it is technically feasible to use higher-energy X-ray sources,
but these are less widely available. For the above reasons, many in-
process monitoring tools are being developed to improve the identi-
ﬁcation of ﬂaws during the process, rather than post-process.
5. Conclusions
This review paper has demonstrated numerous successful
examples of metal AM in aerospace applications. Various AM tech-
nologies are utilized for aerospace applications with L-PBF and
DED as the most popular. DED is used for components with large
build volumes and can be used to repair existing components in
addition to building components. L-PBF is the most widely used
for applications in aerospace with its capabilities to produce fully
dense components at high resolution with complex geometries,
with small to medium build volumes [200]. Most applications of
metal AM in aerospace, demonstrated in Table 2 and Table 3, have
shown advantages for cost and schedule reduction, some applica-
tions see mass reduction improvements and many part consolida-
tions
from
previous
designs.
However,
metal
AM
has
the
challenges of part certiﬁcation, unique quality control require-
ments, poor high-volume production rates, limited materials in
use, post-processing challenges, potential reduced fatigue proper-
ties, supply chain maturity issues, high cost of machines and
expertise required to produce functional components.
Many open research questions remain, with opportunities for
enhanced understanding and performance and further develop-
ments in the near future. The most important areas of current
development are listed and discussed below:

 Build simulation for identiﬁcation of risks
 In-space and non-terrestrial AM
 Wider usage of architected cellular structures (lattices)
 Usage of optimization techniques such as topology optimization
(TO) and hybrid analytical thermal optimization (HAATO)
 Multi-functional components such as integrated electronics and
sensors in AM processes
Signiﬁcant future growth areas include the application of novel
custom alloys, bimetallic and multimetallic processing and charac-
terization,
detailed
process-structure–property
understanding,
databases for AM materials, process certiﬁcation, design optimiza-
tion, and process simulations. The application of TO and the use of
lattice structures has potential for mass reduction, which is a
requirement for aerospace. In both cases, the growing understand-
ing of the design and successful fabrication of such structures leads
to
improvements
in
components
with
increasingly
complex
designs. TO has already seen some applications throughout aero-
space with emphasis on lightweighting of components. Lattice
structures have shown much potential for improvements in design
for aerospace applications. With unique and precisely designed
properties such as energy absorption characteristics, lightweight-
ing and heat transfer characteristics, lattice structures are expected
to be a popular topic of interest for research in aerospace applica-
tions in the near future. It is expected that these optimized geome-
tries
are
also
simultaneously
optimized
for
build
quality
optimization, minimizing the need for support structures or over-
hanging regions, thereby enhancing the surface quality and mini-
mizing the defect formation. Build simulation is expected to play
an increasingly important role in optimizing the build quality by
ﬁnding the optimal orientation and highlighting regions of poten-
tial thermal build-up, which can inform the design process. While
the potential for TO and lattice structures could be used for mass
reduction, there needs to be a signiﬁcant understanding of
mechanical and thermal load paths in addition to integrated load,
which are not always deﬁned with high certainty in aerospace. This
is another area of research to ensure the techniques are applied
appropriately and allow for fully safe and successful missions.
As highlighted here, the main advantages of metal AM in aero-
space is cost and lead time reduction. Mass reduction is also a sig-
niﬁcant opportunity area with optimized design or use of multiple
alloys, however these techniques need to be well understood and
properties well deﬁned. In addition, part consolidation is a major
advantage in this industry. Part complexity capabilities inherent
in metal AM allows for high complexity within components,
including internal features such as channels and high surface area
for heat transfer applications. AM has also been demonstrated in
many large-scale applications, so scale is becoming far less of a
limitation. These and other advantages of metal AM in aerospace
hold great potential for wider adoption of this technology, which
will further drive the remaining challenges to be overcome.
