Preface to the First (German) Edition
In the middle of the twentieth century, the sociologist finds him-
self in an awkward position.
While he
is just beginning to lay and
secure the foundations of his discipline, an impatient public demands
with increasing urgency both immediately applicable and comprehen-
sive solutions from him.
Following almost every sociological confer-
ence, confident journalists charge sociologists with being either igno-
rant of practical problems or incapable of solving them. Like an angry
creditor, the public pursues the sociologist's every move in order to
lay its hands on every penny he may produce.
Is
it surprising that
under these conditions many a sociologist has begun to forge currency.?
The public deserves no better j but unfortunately the false currency,
the overly rapid as well as the all-embracing solutions harm the prog-
ress of sociology as well. They remove sociological discussion from
the sphere of scholarly criticism which inspires ever new efforts to
that of a sterile quarrel of opinions.
It is therefore necessary to make
a decision.
The sociologist certainly is a debtor of the society in which he lives
in a way unparalleled in most other disciplines of scholarship.
But
this debt merely forces him to choose the subjects of his research in
such a way that
its results—if any—might contribute to informing
society about itself. This is all.
In developing his theories, methods,
and techniques, the sociologist
is bound exclusively by the rules of
all scholarship, which demand from him accuracy and adherence to
that pedestrian path of science which nobody else can take for him
and which no magic force can abridge.
Inevitably, this path involves
byways and detours j
it
is a long way, and its destination may disap-
point his and others' expectations j perhaps somebody else soon shows
that the path chosen was altogether wrong.
But
if an
ill-advised
public does not understand the process of scientific inquiry and de-
mands more, the sociologist may and must be sufficiently proud and
confident to defend his scholarly responsibility in face of a miscon-
ceived obligation to society which
is all too often informed by little
more than a desire to please. Htc RhoduSy hie salta!

Preface to the First (German) Edition
These remarks are in place at the beginning of a study, the sub-
ject of which
is as extensive as
its results are tentative, modest, and
in need of supplementation. The attempt
is made here to tackle a
problem, which has for a long time been strangely neglected, with
partly new and partly more refined means. To many
it may sound
surprising
if
I
call a problem neglected about which
the present
study lists more than two hundred bibliographical references which
could
easily be doubled and
trebled.
Probably
the word
"class"
belongs to the most frequently used words of sociology. But I am not
concerned here with the word.
I should not hesitate to replace
it by
a better one if I could find such} moreover,
it will appear less fre-
quently in the present investigation than might be expected.
I am
concerned with a problem, namely, with the puzzling fact that social
structures as distinct from most other structures are capable of pro-
ducing within themselves the elements
of
their
supersession and
change.
Social structures not only are subject to change but create
permanently and systematically some of the determinant forces of
their change within themselves. Among these forces certain groups
are paramount, the
conflict of which may lead to modifications of
existing values and institutions.
I shall attempt to show in the present
study how these groups and the processes to which they contribute
can be identified theoretically and analyzed empirically.
Perhaps a word of explanation is necessary as to why I have given
a study of this problem the title Class and Class Conflict.
At least
one great sociologist, Karl Marx, has used the concept of class
in
the context intimated by the foregoing remarks.
It
is undeniable
that not very many have followed Marx in this.
Little more than
a dozen (if important) sociologists who understand Marx's and our
problem as one of class will be mentioned in the course of this study.
Moreover, we shall have
to subject the approaches of Marx and
most later sociologists to severe
criticism which often leads to the
conclusion that they are vague, imprecise, incomplete, or even unten-
able and erroneous. The overwhelming majority of sociologists since
Sombart and Max Weber have associated the concept of class with
other types of problems, especially with those of social stratification.
A regrettable chain of circumstances seems to have committed both
the original meaning of the concept of class and the problem of
its
first use to oblivion.
All these factors can hardly serve to justify the
attempts to revive both the problem and the concept of class in their
original definition. However, so far as the problem is concerned, no
justification is necessary, and with respect to the concept
I shall try

----- Page 11 (native) -----
Preface to the First (German) Edition
ix
to point out that the situation is not quite as hopeless as
it may seem
at first sight. To anticipate but one argument here: There is, in soci-
ological terminology,
a
useful
alternative
for
the misunderstood
concept of
class,
i.e., the term "stratum," whereas for
the well-
understood concept of class a substitute has not yet been found.
For two reasons one can predict with some confidence that the
present study will be misunderstood.
One of these rests with the
strict distinction of "class" and "stratum" and their respective heu-
ristic purposes. By stratum I shall understand a category of persons
who occupy a similar position on a hierarchical scale of certain situa-
tional characteristics such as income, prestige, style of life. "Stratum"
is a descriptive category. By contrast, the concept of class is an ana-
lytical category which has meaning only in the context of a theory
of
class.
"Classes"
are
interest groupings emerging from
certain
structural
conditions
which
operate
as
such
and
effect
structure
changes. The confusion of these two concepts and spheres of analy-
sis is so complete that
I cannot hope to eliminate
it entirely by this
first attempt at clarification, even if I should have succeeded in sepa-
rating class and stratum convincingly and consistently.
I must accept
the misunderstanding which is possible, even probable here, just like
another one which goes even deeper and touches upon the patheti-
cally preliminary discussion of the possibility of a sociological science.
I ask the reader's indulgence if I refrain here from a general con-
sideration of
this subject and
instead refer
to
the
present study
itself as a testimony to my conception of sociology. There is but one
aspect of the problem which
I should like to mention
in advance,
even as
it
is going to increase rather than mitigate misunderstand-
ings: If in this study I speak of "theory," "hypothesis," "empirical
test," "refutation," and
"science,"
I use these terms
in the
strict
sense of the methodological characteristics of an empirical discipline.
At least logically, physics, physiology, and sociology are subject to
the same laws—whatever may render one or the other of these dis-
ciplines empirically preferable in terms of exactness.
I cannot see
why
it should not be at least desirable to try to free sociology of
the double fetters of an idiographic historical and a meta-empirical
philosophical orientation and weld
it into an exact social science with
precisely—ideally,
of
course,
mathematically—formulated
postu-
lates, theoretical models, and testable laws.
The attempt must be
made; and although the present study remains far removed from
its satisfactory completion,
I want
it to be understood
in terms of
such an attempt.

Preface to the First (German) Edition
Generalizing theoretical formulation and
its empirical
test are
balanced in the present investigation. With R. K. Merton I regard
"theories of the middle range" as the immediate task of sociological
research:
generalizations that are inspired by or oriented towards
concrete
observations.
However, the
exposition of the theory of
social classes and class conflict stands in the center of this investiga-
tion. The resume of Marx's theory of class, the largely descriptive
account of some historical changes of the past century, and the criti-
cal examination of some earlier theories of class, including that of
Marx, lead up to the central theoretical chapters j with the analysis
of post-capitalist society in terms of class theory a first empirical test
of my theoretical position is intended. The whole investigation re-
mains in the "middle range" also in that
it
is, as
its title indicates,
confined to industrial society.
Many suggestions and stimulations which have gone into the
present study originated in discussions in a small informal group of
younger sociologists from diverse countries at the London School of
Economics in the years 1952-54. This group, which called itself the
"Thursday Evening Seminar," although
it often continued
its dis-
cussions until Friday morning and met on other days as well, not
only occupied itself with many of the specific questions of this study
—such as Marx, Parsons, the whole problem of interest groups
but displayed a conception of sociology and
its task which
I hope
to have upheld throughout this study.
Within the "Thursday Eve-
ning Seminar" and since, the stimulation of numerous conversations
with Dr. D. Lockwood, Lecturer in Sociology at the London School
of Economics, has, above all, furthered the progress of my own in-
vestigation into class theory.
In the hope that the provisional result
of these investigations may provide a useful
basis for
critical
dis-
cussion
I dedicate this study to David Lockwood and with him to
our common friends of the London years.

Preface to the Revised (English) Edition
In every sense but one, this study is an essay even in its revised
version.
It is tentative, incomplete, open to criticism at many points,
and,
I hope,
stimulating^
but
it
is
also longer than the
rules of
essay writing would permit.
Despite
its length,
I wish
to empha-
size the exploratory nature of my attempt
to tackle problems of
social conflict concerning total societies. By and large, recent devel-
opments of sociology have been characterized by two related features.
Firstly, there has been a strong concern for the conditions of "equi-
librium" in "social systems." Stimulated by anthropological research,
an image of society has gained prevalence
in sociological thinking
which emphasizes the elements of functional coordination, integra-
tion, and consensus in units of social organization. The attempt to
evolve testable theories and applicable conclusions has led, secondly,
to an ever-growing interest in comparatively small "social systems"
such as communities, enterprises, and, above all, small groups. Both
these concerns of contemporary sociological analysis are, to be sure,
important, and have proved fruitful.
At the same time, however,
they have led many to abandon completely such other subjects of
sociological analysis as did not seem to
fit in with the general trend.
As a result, there is today a considerable need for reorienting socio-
logical analysis to problems of change, conflict, and coercion in social
structures, and especially in those of total societies. The interest in
total
societies, as well as
in their
historical dimension,
is of course
as old as sociology itself.
Yet their neglect in recent decades makes
a study like this one a venture into unmapped areas of inquiry—
venture which
is guided not so much by the hope of comprehensive
and final results as by the intention of challenging others to follow,
criticize, and explore other avenues of discovery.
From the reviews of the original German version of this study
I have learned with some pride that
it has in fact achieved at least
one of its ends:
it has stimulated critical discussion.
It seems to me
that few things are more deadly to the progress of knowledge than

----- Page 14 (native) -----
xii
Preface to the Revised (English) Edition
the deterioration of book reviews into advertisements. Lack of con-
troversy means lack of interest, of stimulation and advance.
I deem
myself lucky to have escaped this pathetic fate.
Most of the criti-
cism of my study has been concerned with the theory of
conflict
whose rudiments are presented in the second half of this book.
It
has converged on five admittedly problematic points: (i) the reten-
tion of the term "class" for a theory that dispenses with the histori-
cal
reference
to
antagonisms between
"bourgeoisie" and
"prole-
tariat" 5
(2)
the "definition" of the crucial concepts of power and
authority;
(3) the separation and, in part, the confrontation of in-
dustrial and
political
class
conflict j
(4)
the application of
conflict
theory to the analysis of contemporary society, especially to its "rul-
ing classes" j (5) the absence of a grounding of this analysis on "large-
scale inquiries of a more ^practical' kind." There have also been mis-
understandings and more dogmatic (often Marxian) criticisms of my
study J but the five points mentioned indicate comments and objec-
tions which seem to me of particular importance.
I do not propose to
argue with my
critics at
this point.
Instead,
I present the revised
edition of this essay, in which
I have incorporated many suggestions
offered by reviewers and other readers, have explicitly rejected others,
and have tried to clarify parts that tended to cause misinterpretations.
Where the revised version has improved on the original, this
is due
to no small extent to the critical comments of colleagues reviewing
my book.
The revised edition differs from the original in many respects j
in fact, the author feels—with what probably
is but a sign of lack
of detachment from
his own work—that
it
is
a completely new
book.
For the sake of clarity of purpose,
I have now divided the
whole into two parts.
Part One
is concerned with a
critical exami-
nation of facts and theories relating to the problem of class.
It deals
above
all with the doctrine of Marx,
its empirical refutation and
theoretical
supersession.
All
chapters
of
this
part have been
ex-
panded and
partly
rewritten j
one
of them—Chapter
II—shares
with
its equivalent in the original
little more than the
title; other-
wise hardly a word has remained the same.
Part Two presents my
attempt to approach conflict analysis both
in terms of abstract con-
siderations (Chapters V and VI) and with
reference
to post-capi-
talist
society
(Chapters VII and VIII).
Here, two
entirely new
chapters have been added, incorporating refinements of the theory
as well as extensions of its application, while the remaining two have
undergone substantial revision.
Careful scrutiny of the emphases in

----- Page 15 (native) -----
Preface to the Revised (English) Edition
xiii
the work of revision would reveal that in the years since this book
was
originally written my
interest has shifted from problems of
industry to those of politics.
Most of the additions and changes in
the present edition have been stimulated by the desire to render con-
flict theory applicable
to the analysis of the
political process both
in totalitarian and in free societies of the present. A number of new
books which either appeared or came to my knowledge since the date
of the
first publication of this study have been incorporated in the
substance of the investigation as well as in
its Bibliography.
Finally, an important difference between the original and the
revised version of this study consists in the fact that the former was
written in German, the latter in English.
I should like to empha-
size the expression "written in English," for this is not, strictly speak-
ing, a translation. The author translating his own book has the su-
preme advantage of being free with
respect
to
his
text. He can
reformulate, change, even leave out
at
will a phrase that sounds
reasonable in one but awkward in the other language.
This may be
worrying to philologists, but
it
is gratifying both to the author and
—I hope—to
his readers.
Also, the author translator
is not held
up by problems of interpretation j presumably he knows what he
meant by
his statements.
(In
fact,
I found the task of "transla-
tion" an acid test for ambiguities of thought and formulation, and
therefore
a welcome
opportunity
for rendering many
a
passage
more
precise.)
I
fear, however,
that the advantages of "transla-
tion" by the author
are
in
this
case more than balanced by
the
considerable disadvantages accruing from the fact that I have "trans-
lated" this book into a language other than my mother tongue.
If
the resulting text
is at
all readable,
this
is due in no small extent
to the careful and competent editing on the part of the publisher,
Mr. Leon Seltzer, and his editors.
It
is above all due to the assist-
ance of my wife who shares this book v/ith me both
in the tangible
sense of having put many hours of work into correcting the lan-
guage (her mother tongue being English), typing, offering sugges-
tions, and listening, and
in numerous
less tangible yet even more
important ways.
I am profoundly grateful also to Mr. G. Fleischmann, my as-
sistant and collaborator
at the Akademie für Genieinw'irtschaft
in
Hamburg, for having put aside his own work in order to help me
in preparing and editing the manuscript, compiling the Bibliography,
checking quotations, preparing the Index, and
discussing with me
many substantial points and arguments raised in this study.

Preface to the Revised (English) Edition
I had dedicated the original edition of this study to my friend
Dr. David Lockwood and to our common friends at the London
School of Economics, because
it was with and through these that I
received the impulses that made me undertake
this
investigation.
Whatever new ideas and analyses there may be in this revised edi-
tion are inspired largely by many friendly discussions with fellow
fellows at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences
in 1957-58, both inside and outside the "Conflict Seminar." With
especial
gratitude
I
record here my
debt
to Joseph Ben-David,
Ph.D., John Bowlby, M.D., Professor Frank Newman, LL.D.,
Professor Fritz Stern, Ph.D.j and
I should like to add Professors
R. Bendix and S. M. Lipset of the University of California at Berke-
ley.
As an outward acknowledgment of my indebtedness
to these
colleagues and friends as well as to many other co-fellows at the
Center I have extended to them the dedication of this book.

Karl Marx^s Model of the Class Society
THE SOCIAL ETYMOLOGY OF THE CONCEPT OF CLASS
The concept of class has never remained a harmless concept for
very long. Particularly when applied to human beings and their social
conditions
it has invariably displayed a peculiar explosiveness. The
logician runs no risk in distinguishing "classes" of judgments or cate-
gories j the biologist need not worry about "classifying" the organisms
with which he is concerned—but if the sociologist uses the concept of
class he not only must carefully explain in which of its many meanings
he wants it to be understood, but also must expect objections that are
dictated less by scientific insight than by political prejudice. As Lipset
and Bendix have stated: "Discussions of diflFerent theories of class are
often academic substitutes for a real conflict over political orienta-
tions" (55, p. 150).'
We shall have to show where this impermissible and unfortunate
confusion of judgments of fact and value originates in this case, and
we shall have to find ways and means to weld the concept and theory
of class into useful tools of sociological analysis without evaluative
overtones. However, for the time being we have to resign ourselves
to the fact that using the concept of class may cause misunderstandings
of many kinds.
Evaluative shifts of meaning have accompanied the concept of
class throughout its history. When the Roman censors introduced the
word classis to divide the population into tax groups, they may not
have anticipated the eventful future of this category.
Yet even their
classification implied at least the possibility of evaluative distinctions:
on the one end of their classification were the assidui, who might well
be proud of their 100,000 as; on the other end were the proletarii,
whose only "property" consisted in their numerous offspring
proles
—and who were outdone only by the lumpenproletariat of the capite
censi, those counted by their heads.
Just as the American term "in-
^ Figures in parentheses refer to the corresponding numbers in the bibliography
at the end of the volume.

Marx^s Model
come bracket," although originally no more than a statistical category,
touches upon the most vulnerable point of social inequality, it was true
for the classes of ancient Rome that they divided the population into
more than statistical units. "The movie was classy," teen-agers say,
meaning "high-class," "first-class."
Similarly, to say that some Ro-
man was classis or classicus meant that he belonged to the fnma classis,
to the upper class—unless he was explicitly described as a "fifth-class"
proletarian.
Since Gellius we know the adjective classicus in its appli-
cation to "first-class" artists and works of art, a usage which survives
in our word "classical" and was eventually related to the authors of
the term themselves and their times:
they lived in "classical" an-
tiquity.
When more recently sociologists remembered the word, they nat-
urally gave
it a slightly different connotation.
Initially the word
"class" was used—for example, by Ferguson (2) and Millar (15)
in the eighteenth century—simply to distinguish social strata, as we
should say today, by their rank or wealth.
In this sense the word
"class" can be found in all European languages in the late eighteenth
century. In the nineteenth century the concept of class gradually took
on a more definite coloring. Adam Smith had already spoken of the
"poor" or "labouring class."
In the works of Ricardo and Ure, Saint-
Simon and Fourier, and of course in those of Engels and Marx the
"class of capitalists" makes its appearance beside the "labouring class,"
the "rich" beside the "poor class," the "bourgeoisie" beside the "pro-
letariat" (which has accompanied the concept of class from its Roman
origins).
Since this particular concept of social class was first applied
in the middle of the nineteenth century, its history has been as event-
ful as that of the society for which it was designed. However, before
we embark on a critical journey through this history it appears useful
to survey the meaning and significance of the "classical" concept of
class as it was formulated by Karl Marx.
CONSEQUENCES OF INDUSTRIALIZATION
"The history of the working class in England begins with the last
half of the past [eighteenth] century, with the invention of the steam
engine and the machines for manufacturing cotton," wrote the young
Engels in 1845 (i, p. 31). With the industrial revolution also, the
history of the concept of class as a tool of social analysis began. Earlier,
the concepts of "class" and "rank" could be interchanged as by Fergu-
son and Millar j indeed, that of "rank" could be preferred. The super-
ficial observer at least was above all struck by "distinctions of rank"

in late feudal society.^
In the emerging industrial society, however,
rank and social position gave way to much cruder distinctions. As capi-
tal, property became transformed from a symbol of rank to an instru-
ment of power growing steadily in strength and effectiveness. Much
as nobility and small independent peasants might resent
it, both be-
came witnesses and victims of the disappearance of an old and the
emergence of a new social order, before which all well-tried categories
of understanding and explanation failed.
The history of the industrial revolution and its immediate conse-
quences is too well known to be repeated here. However, one aspect
of this history appears essential for our discussion. Wealth and pov-
erty, domination and subjection, property and propertylessness, high
and low prestige—all these were present before the industrial revolu-
tion as afterward. Thus it might appear as if all the industrial revo-
lution effected was to replace old social strata by new ones: landowners
and nobility by capitalists, laborers and small peasants by proletarians.
This presentation, however, not only is oversimplified but overlooks
the revolutionary character of the changes which accompanied indus-
trialization.
The difference between the early stages of
industrial
society in Europe and its historical predecessor was not just due to a
change in the personnel of social positions j
it was due above all to the
simultaneous abolition of the system of norms and values which guar-
anteed and legitimized the order of preindustrial society. The "dis-
tinctions of rank"
in preindustrial
societies of even the eighteenth
century rested as much on a myth of tradition, an intricate system of
age-old, often codified rights and duties,
as on the comparatively
crude gradations of property, power, and prestige.
Preindustrial so-
ciety, of course, had also had its beginnings.
Its claim to the legiti-
macy of the present was also a product of history or, perhaps, an ide-
ology. Yet when it was hit by the revolution of industry, this society
had an order endowed by the patina of centuries with a special claim
to legitimacy and a special solidity. The power of the landlord was
not based on his having money, land, or prestige, but on his being a
^ Of course, Ferguson and Millar understood by "rank" by no means only what
we call "prestige" today.
In fact, Millar's formulation sounds surprisingly "modern":
"According to the accidental differences of wealth possessed by individuals, a subordi-
nation of ranks
is gradually introduced, and different degrees of power and authority
are assumed without opposition, by particular persons, or bestowed upon them by the
personal voice of the society." The difference
indicated above and caused by
the
industrial revolution
is rather a difference of perspective, which may be expressed by
the terms "estate" and "class."

landlord as his fathers had been for time immemorial. The condi-
tions of the master craftsman, his journeymen and apprentices, and
even that of the laborer resembled that of the landlord in their legiti-
mation by the
authority of
tradition.
In
this sense,
preindustrial
society was what contemporary sociologists like to call, with a some-
what doubtful expression, a "relatively static social order"
(cf. Cox
40, p. 467).
Precisely these features were eliminated by the industrial revolu-
tion.^
Surprisingly soon it created—to begin with, in England—two
rapidly growing new
strata, those of entrepreneurs and workers.
There was no "precedent" for either, even if in England the Poor
Laws mixed the old and the new poor in the same way the Crown
mixed the old and the new aristocracy.
Both
these
strata, "bour-
geoisie" and "proletariat," which had grown up together and were
tied to each other, had no tradition of rank, no myth of legitimacy,
no "prestige of descent" (to quote Max Weber). They were charac-
terized solely by the crude indices of possession and nonpossession,
of domination and subjection.
Industrial capitalists and laborers had
no "natural," no traditional, unity as strata.
In order to gain it, they
had to stabilize and create their own traditions.
They were, so to
speak, nouveaux riches and nouveaux fcrnvres, intruders in a system of
inherited values and messengers of a new system. And for these strata,
bare of all traditions and differentiated merely by external, almost
material criteria, the concept of "class" was first used in modern social
science.
In the analysis of these strata this concept became a sociologi-
cal category.
It is significant that in conversational German the word
"class" is even today confined to the two strata of entrepreneurs and
workers. Neither the nobility nor the professions nor the older groups
of craftsmen and peasants are called classes. They are "estates"—
concept which in the case of the "middle estate" {Mittelstand) has
been retained even for the newer groups of white-collar workers and
civil servants.* An estate, however, is something else than a stratum or
' A schematic sketch like the one attempted here obviously ignores local differ-
ences
as well
as the gradual character of the emergence of
industrial
societies.
All
social historians of industrial development—from Weber (189)
and Sombart (28),
Tawney (187), and the Hammonds (175)
to Bendix (138) and Jantke (178)
in
recent years—emphasize the gradual breakdown of the traditions of agrarian society.
Concentration on the imaginary point of an "industrial revolution" can be justified
only by the analytical purpose of these introductory remarks.

is of course only partly open to generali-
zation.

it documents the thesis here advanced about the his-
torical context of the concept of class,

class, not only in everyday language but for the sociologist as well.
**Status position' can be based on class position of a definite or indefi-
nite kind. But it is not determined by class position alone: possession
of money or the position of entrepreneur are not in themselves status
qualifications, although they can become suchj propertylessness is not
in itself status disqualification, although
it can become such'* (M.
Weber 330, p. 180). "A number of persons forming a social-status
stratum more or less clearly delimited from other strata in customary
or statutory law constitutes a social estate" (Cox 40,
p. 467). An
estate, as against a class or—to anticipate the result of later conceptual
discussions at this point—an open stratum, is characterized by the very
attributes which the bourgeoisie and the proletariat of early industrial
societies were lacking: the sacred tie of tradition and the undisputed
belief in the historically founded legitimacy of position.
Thus the concept of class in its modern formulation is, if not the
result of a definite historical situation, oriented toward and linked
with such a situation. How difficult it is to extract the concept from this
situation and apply it to other groups than bourgeoisie and proletariat,
other societies than the industrializing societies of Europe,
is shown
most clearly by the long and still unconcluded sociological discussion
of the work of Marx. The attempt to generalize the concept of class
would of course hardly be worth the effort, if it were merely a name
for social units like bourgeoisie or proletariat. In fact it is more.
Since
Marx, "class," "stratum," "rank," and "position" are no longer inter-
changeable names for identical groupings. For even if Marx received
most of his inspiration and material from the situation of English so-
ciety half a century after the industrial revolution, this society was in
a sense no more than an example for him, an illustration that served
to test the usefulness of a more general approach.
Since Marx devel-
oped, on the basis of the concept of class, at least the rudiments of a
theory of class, the model of a class society, his approach stands at the
beginning of the considerations of this study.
importance of preindustrial strata in German
society-. The use of the term "middle
class"
in English
is certainly no accident.
° In translating Weber's term Stand, most translators have used the word "status."
This—though not false—is misleading in that
it does not convey the double meaning
of the German Stand
as "status" and "estate."
In the passage quoted here, Weber
undoubtedly meant
to describe status in an estate context (rather than,
for example,
prestige status).
This
is only one example of the exigencies of translations—and of
their creativity.
By the very
fact of misleading they can create terms
that acquire
a life of their own.

MARx's THEORY OF CLASS
There have been many and violent disputes about the interpre-
tation of the work of Marx, but no commentator has seriously doubted
the central importance of the theory of class for this work.
Indeed,
the greatness and fatality of his work become apparent
in Marx's
theory of class.
In this theory, the three roots of his thought are
joined. Marx adopted the word from the early British political econo-
mists;
its application to "capitalists" and "proletarians" stems from
the French "utopian" socialists; the conception of the class struggle
is based on Hegel's dialectics. The theory of class provides the prob-
lematic link between sociological analysis and philosophical specula-
tion in the work of Marx. Both can be separated, and have to be sep-
arated, but in this process the theory of class is cut in two; for it is as
essential for Marx's philosophy of history as it is for his analysis of
the dynamics of capitalist society.
Marx regarded the theory of class as so important that he post-
poned its systematic exposition time and again in favor of refinements
by empirical analysis. As a result we know
it only by its application
to concrete problems and by the occasional generalizations that occur
throughout Marx's works.
This may not be the least cause of the
many controversies about the real meaning of Marx's concept and
theory of class.
Only recently the accounts of Geiger (46) and of
Bendix and Lipset (36) have concluded these discussions, at least in
"Western" sociology.
It is not my intention, in presenting my inter-
pretation of Marx's approach, to relight the fires of controversy. The
following discussion of the concept and theory of class in the work
of Marx, while not materially deviating from either Geiger or Bendix
and Lipset, is designed to supplement their works and add some sub-
stance to an investigation that
is indebted to Marx even in
its most
radical criticisms of his work.
Marx postponed the systematic presentation of his theory of class
until death took the pen from his hand. The irony has often been
noted that the last (52nd) chapter of the last (third) volume of Capi-
tal, which bears the
title "The Classes," has remained unfinished.
After little more than one page the text ends with the lapidary remark
of its editor, Engels: "Here the manuscript breaks off." However,
for the thorough reader of Marx this is no reason for despair.
If he
wants to, he can complete this chapter for Marx—not exactly as Marx
would have written
it, of course, and not entirely without interpreta-
tion either, but in any case without substantially adding to what Marx
said himself.
In the following section I shall try to do just this. By

systematically ordering a number of quotations and connecting them
to a coherent text I shall attempt to provide a basis and point of ref-
erence for critical discussion without anticipating—beyond the selec-
tion and ordering of the quotations—any interpretation.®
"THE CLASSES"
The unwritten 52nd chapter of Volume III of Marx's Cafital
THE PROBLEM
It is the ultimate fur-pose of this work to reveal the economic laws
of develofm^ent of modern society ( 1 2, 1, pp. 7 f .) . We are therefore
not concerned with merely describing, much less regretting, existing
conditions, but want to lay bare their revolutionary aspect. We have
shown that the capitalist mode of production has become too restricted
for
its own forces of production. The revolution
is near.
But this
revolution is not the product of economic forces of production or rela-
tions of production, but of the people and groups that represent these
economic formations. Of all instruments of production the greatest
force of production is the revolutionary class itself (6, p. 188).
For almost forty years we have emphasized the class struggle as
the primary motive force of history^ and especially the class struggle
between bourgeoisie and proletariat as the great lever of modern social
change ( 1 1, p. 102). With the moment in which civilization begins^
production begins to be based on the antagonism between accumulated
and direct labor. Without conflict^ no progress: that is the law which
civilization has followed to the present day.
Until now the forces of
production have developed by virtue of the dominance of class con-
flict (6, p. 80). And it always holds that a change in the relation of
classes is a historical change (5, II, p. 475).
Thus we have to determine in general what constitutes a class and
how class conflict emerges and expresses itself.
In a general investi-
gation of this kind it is always assumed that real coftditions correspond
to their conception, or, which
is the same things that real conditions
are presented only in so far as they express their own general type
(12, III, p,
167). We are therefore not concerned with describing
any one society, but with discovering the general laws which determine
the trend of social development.
// we observe a given country from the point of view of political
economy, we have to start with
its population,
its distribution into

classes, town, country, sea, the different industries, exfort and import,
annual
production and
consumption,
commodity
prices,
etc.
(7,
p, 256). But this method presents difficulties.
It leads us astray if in
our abstractions we do not find the way to the real and concrete, the
real premise. Population is an abstraction if I ignore, for example, the
classes of which it consists.
These classes are again an empty word, if
I do not know the elements on which they are based, e.g., wage labor,
capital, etc. (7, p. 256). Thus our first question concerns the elements
on which classes are based j and since modern bourgeois society
is in
fact our main subject (7, p. 237), we use it for the time being as an
example.
The owners of mere labor power, the owners of capital, and the
landowners, whose respective sources of income are wage, profit, and
rent—thus wage laborers, capitalists, and landowners—constitute the
three great classes of modern society based on a capitalist mode of
production.
In England, modern society has undoubtedly advanced furthest
and most classically in its economic structure. Even there, however,
this class structure is not displayed in a pure form.
Intermediate and
transitional stages obliterate the borderlines there as everywhere (al-
though incomparably less in the country than in towns). However,
this does not matter for our investigation.
It has been demonstrated
that it is the per'^nanent tendency and law of development of the capi-
talist mode of production to separate the means of production increas-
ingly from labor, and to concentrate the separate m-eans of production
m^ore and tnore in large groups—in other words, to transform labor
into wage labor, and the means of production into capital. A t the same
tvme^ land ownership tends to be separated from capital and labor, and
to be converted into the type of land ownership corresponding to the
capitalist mode of production.
The question to be answered next is: What constitutes a class?
And this results directly from the answer to the other question: What
makes wage laborers, capitalists, and landowners the constituent forces
of the three great social classes?
( 12, III, p. 941.)
TWO FALSE APPROACHES
At first it is the identity of revenues and sources of inco^ne. They
are three large social groups, whose components,
i.e., the people of
whom they consist, earn their living by wage, profit, and rent, i.e., by
utilizing their labor power, capital, and land ownership.
However,
from this point of view, say, doctors and civil servants would also

----- Page 29 (native) -----
Marx's Model
1
constitute two classes^ for they belong to two different social groups
whose members^ inco?nes flow from the same source. The same would
hold for the infinite fragmentation of interests and positions which
the division of labor produces mnong workers as among capitalists and
landowners (the latter^ for example^ into vineyard ownersy field own-
ersy forest ownerSy m^ine ownerSy fishing ground owners)
(12, III,
pp. 941
f.).
This approach does not therefore lead to a fruitful
definition.
The same holds for a second approach frequently adopted
in
ex-
plaining class differences and conflicts.
The vulgar m,ind commutes
class differences into
^^differences in the
size of purses^* and class
conflict into
^^trade disputes.*^ The size of the purse is a purely quan-
titative differencey by virtue of which two individuals of the same
class can be opposed quite arbitrarily.
It is well known that medieval
guilds quarreled with each other ^^according to trade. ^^ But it is equal-
ly well known that modern class differences are by no m^eans based
on "trade.** Rathery the division of labor has created very different
types of work within the same class (5, II, pp. 466 f.).
In both cases the essential point is overlooked: property, income,
and source of income are themselves a result of the class structure,
i.e., of the structure of economic conditions.
Income and property
are criteria belonging to the realm of distribution and consumption.
However, the use of products is determined by the social relations
of the consumerSy and these social relations themselves rest on the
conflict of classes (6, p. 81). And since distribution is itself a prod-
uct of productiony the kind of participation in production determines
the particular patterns of distributiony the way in which people par-
ticipate in distribution (7, p. 250).
There is no property anterior to the relations of domination and
subjection which obtain in production and in the political state, and
which are far more concrete relations (7, p. 258)
. Therefore we have
to look for the elements of classes in production and in the power
relations determined by
it.
PROPERTY AND ECONOMIC POWER
The essential condition that determines the mode of production
of an epoch, and that therefore provides the constituent element of
classes as well as the momentum of social change,
is property.
The
property
question, relative
to the different stages of development
of industry y has always been the life question of any given class (5,
p. 459)-

----- Page 30 (native) -----
1
Marx's Model
However, this statement
is open to misinterpretation.
For the
offosition of fro-pertylessness and froferty
as such
is indijferenty
and not expressed in an active relation to its inner structure^ i.e.y as
a contradiction, so long as it is not comprehended as the opposition
between labor and capital (3, p. 176).
Even in this specification property is still an abstraction, an empty
concept. In every historical epoch property has developed differently
and under different social conditions.
To define bourgeois property
means no less than to describe all the social conditions of bourgeois
production.
The attempt to define property as an independent re-
lation, a special category, an abstract and eternal idea, can be noth-
ing but an illusion of metaphysics or jurisprudence (6, p. 169).
Only
if we understand property
in
the
particular
context
of
bourgeois society, i.e., as private ownership of the means of produc-
tion, as the control of a minority over the wealth of a whole nation,
do we in fact grasp the core of the antagonism existing in production
and creating class conflict.
The power of society thus becomes the
private power of a private person (12,
I, p. 138).
The essential condition of the existence and domination of the
bourgeois class is the accumulation of wealth in the hands of private
persons, the formation and augmentation of capital;
the condition
of capital is wage labor (14, p. 89).
Thus the existence of capital
as well as wage labor, of the bourgeoisie as well as the proletariat,
can be explained in terms of the one condition of the particular form
of property
in bourgeois
society,
i.e., ownership
of the means of
production.
The authority relations within production which are given by
the presence or absence of
effective property, of control over the
means of production, are of course not the class relations themselves.
In order to determine these, we have to look for the consequences
flowing from the relations of production and for the social antago-
nisms based on these consequences.
RELATIONS OF PRODUCTION, CLASS SITUATION, AND
POLITICAL POWER
One important consequence of the relations of production has
already been mentioned.
The division of wealth
in the sphere of
distribution corresponds to the division of property
in production.
Thus a person's material condition of existence, or class situation,
is
based on his position in production.
Economic conditions have first
converted the mass of the population into workers.
The rule of

----- Page 31 (native) -----
Marx^s Model
13
cafital has created for this mass a common situation ( 6, p. 187). And
in a way one can state:
In so far as m-illions of families live under
economic conditions which separate their way of life, their interestSy
and their education from those of other classes and of'pose them to
thesey they constitute a class (8, p. 104).
However, these economic conditions of existence are not in them-
selves sufficient for the formation of classes. They are as such pas-
sive, and although they produce the gaf between the life situations
of worker and capitalist (12, I, p. 548), they do not produce a real
antagonism.
For in so far as there
is between people in a common
material condition, or
life situation, a merely external contact—in
so far as the identity of their interests does not 'produce a community
y
national associationy and political organization—they do not consti-
tute a class.
Such groups in a common situation are therefore unable
to m,ake their class interest heard in their own name through a par-
liam^ent or an assembly (8, p. 104). We shall have to return to this
point.
A second and infinitely more important consequence of the dis-
tribution of property in production
is that
it determines the distri-
bution of political power in society. Modern relations of production
include the economic power of the owners of private property, the
capitalists. And the political power of the bourgeois class arises from
these modern relations of production (5, p. 455).
Indeed
it can be
said that the modern state is but an association that administrates the
common business of the whole bourgeois class (14, p. 83).
In
this sense, authority relations
in production determine the
authority relations of society in general.
The specific economic form,
in which unpaid surplus labor is pumped out of the immediate pro-
ducers determines the relation of domination and subjection as
it
grows directly out of and in turn determines production. On this is
based the whole structure of the economic com^nunity as
it cofnes
forth from the relations of productiony and thereby at the same time
its
political structure.
It
is always the immediate relation of the
owners of the conditions of production to the imfnediate producers—
a relation whose specific pattern of course always corresponds to a
certain stage in the developfnent of labor and its social force of pro-
duction—in which we find the final secrety the hidden basis of the
whole construction of society y including the political patterns of sov-
ereignty and dependencCy in shorty of a given specific form of gov-
ernment
{ 12, III, p. 841).
Finally, a third and parallel consequence of the distribution of

----- Page 32 (native) -----
14
Marx^s Model
property in production
is that
it also shapes the ideas that mold the
character of a period. On the different forms of froferty and the
social conditions of existence a whole superstructure of various and
peculiarly formed sentiments^ illusions^ modes of thought^ and con-
ceptions of
life
is
built.
The whole class creates and forms these
out of its Tnaterial foundations and the corresponding social relations
(8, p. 37).
We can say, therefore, that the ruling ideas of a period have
always been nothing but the ideas of the ruling class (14, p. 93).
In each efoch, the thoughts of the ruling class are the ruling thoughts
;
i.e.y the class that is the ruling material 'power of society is at the same
time its ruling intellectual power.
The class that has the m-eans of
m^aterial production in its control^ controls at the same time the means
of intellectual production (13, II, p. 37).
CLASS INTERESTS
We have seen that relations of property and authority constitute
the basis of the formation of
social
classes.
But we have not yet
investigated the
force that
effects this formation.
Classes do
not
exist
in
isolation, independent of other
classes
to which they are
opposed.
Individuals form a class only in so far as they are engaged
in a comm^on struggle with another class (13,
II, p. 59)
j and the
force that effects class formation
is class interest.
In a sense, class
interests precede the formation of classes.
Thus the German bour-
geoisie stands in opposition to the proletariat even before
it has or-
ganized itself as a class in the political sphere (5, p. 469). The pro-
letariat has,
in the beginning of
its development,
certain common
interests^ but
it
is nevertheless still an unorganized mass.
Thus this
mass is already a class in opposition to capital^ but not yet a class for
itself (6, p. 187).
By postulating class interests as preceding the classes themselves,
we make it quite clear that class interests are not merely the random
personal interests of one person or even many people. We are not con-
cerned with what this or that proletarian or even the whole prole-
tariat visualizes as a goal for the time being.
Its goal and its histori-
cal action are obviously and irrevocably predetermined by
its own
life situation as by the whole organization of contemporary bourgeois
society (4, p. 207). Thus the shared interest of a class exists not only
in the imagination^ as a generality y but above all in reality
as the
m,utual dependence of the individuals among whom labor is divided
(13,
II, p. 23).
As in private life we distinguish between what a

----- Page 33 (native) -----
Marx's Model
1
man thinks and says of himself and what he really
is and doeSy so
in historical struggles we must distinguish even more carefully the
catchwords and fantasies of parties from their real organism and their
real interestsy their conception from their reality
(8, p. 38).
Class interests as "objective" interests subsuming the members
of a class under a general force not only can differ from individual,
personal
interests, but can
conflict with these
interests.
Although,
for example, all members of the m^odern bourgeoisie have the same
interest inasmuch as they form a class vis-a-vis another class, they have
nevertheless o-p-posite^ contradictory interests as soon as they are con-
fronted with each other (6, p. 140).
This conflict of interests is not
merely a possibility j
it arises with a degree of necessity from the eco-
nomic conditions of their bourgeois life (6, p. 140).
For example,
the conflict between the interest of the individual capitalist and the
class of capitalists makes itself felt if the problem at hand
is not the
distribution of profits but that of losses, just as before the identity
of interests found its practical realization through competition (12,
III, p. 282).
The substance of class interests, in so far as they are based on the
economic positions of given groups, can be expressed in various ways.
To begin with, the immediate interest of the proletariat
is the wage,
that of the bourgeoisie the profit j and here once again we have to
distinguish the two great categories into which the interest of the
bourgeoisie is divided—land ownership and capital (8, p. 38). From
these immediate concerns, confined to the sphere of production, all
further interests can be derived. As a society develops to its maturity,
the originally divided
interests become increasingly united.
More
and more it is a specific type of production, and of relations of pro-
duction, which determines rank and influence of all other activities
(7, p. 264). This means that two particular interests are increasingly
articulated: the conservative interest of the ruling class, and the revo-
lutionary interest of the oppressed class. Of all the classes with which
the bourgeoisie
is today confronted, only the proletariat
is a truly
revolutiormry class (14, p. 88). And a class in which the revolution-
ary interests of society are concentrated, as soon as
it has risen up,
finds directly in its own situation the content and the material of its
revolutionary
activity: foes to be laid low;
measures, dictated by
the needs of the struggle, to be taken—the consequences of its own
deeds drive
it
on.
It makes no
theoretical
inquiries
into
its
task
(9, p. 42).
On the basis of these class interests, in fighting to realize them

or defend them, the groups determined by the distribution of prop-
erty in production, and by the distribution of political power flowing
from
it, organize themselves into classes.
CLASS ORGANIZATION AND CLASS STRUGGLE
The
organization
of
classes
follows
the
progress of
conflicts
within the sphere of production
itself.
Increasingly the collisions
between the individual worker and the individual bourgeois assume
the character of collisions between two
classes.
The workers start
forming coalitions against the bourgeois; they join in order to m^ain-
tain their wage ( 14, p. 87)
. But the wage is, as we have seen, merely
an undeveloped, prerevolutionary interest of the proletariat.
This
stage of class organization corresponds to a relatively early phase of
capitalist development.
As long as the rule of the bourgeois class
had not organised itself fully ^ and had not acquired its fure political
expression, the opposition of the other classes could not come forth
in its pure form either, and where it did come forth, it could not take
that dangerous turn which converts every struggle against govern-
m^ent into a struggle against capital (8, p. 54). The development of
the forces of production has to be far advanced for the formation of
classes to be possible, because the Organization of the revolutionary
elements as a class presupposes the complete existence of all forces
of production which could possibly develop in the womb of the old
society (6, p. 188).
The formation of classes always means the organization of com-
mon interests in the sphere of politics.
This point needs to be em-
phasized.
Classes are political groups united by a common interest.
The struggle between two classes is a political struggle (6, p. 187).
We therefore speak of classes only in the realm of political conflict.
Thus every movement in which the working class as such opposes
the ruling class and seeks to destroy its power by pressure from with-
out is a political move^nent.
The atternpt, for example, to extort a
limitation of working time in a single factory
or trade, and from
individual capitalists, by strikes, etc., is a purely economic fnovement
;
but the movement
to enforce legislation stipulating an eight-hour
day,
etc.,
is a political movement. And in this manner a
political
movement grows everywhere out of the isolated economic move-
ments of the workers;
i.e.,
it is a movejnent of the class in order to
realize its interests in a general form, in a form that possesses uni-
versal social constraining force (10, p. 90).
Parallel with the political organization of classes there grows up

17
a theoretical class-consciousness (12,
I, p. 13),
i.e., an awareness on
the individual's part of the interests of his class generally. The posi-
tive goals of the proletariat become evident and can be formulated
by
its theoreticians.
As long as the 'proletariat has not sufficiently
developed to organize itself as a class, as long as therefore the strug-
gle of the proletariat with the bourgeoisie as yet has no
political
characterJ these theoreticians are merely Utopians who invent sys-
tems in order to satisfy the needs of the oppressed classes (6, p. 142).
Thus classes are political forces based on the relations of prop-
erty and power.
But although in principle every individual can be
identified as a member of one of the above-named classes according
to his share in property and power,
it
is quite possible that a man's
actions will not always be determined by the class to which he belongs;
hut these individual cases are as irrelevant to the class struggle as the
defection of some noblemen to the Third Estate was to the French
revolution (5, p. 467).
This circulation among the classes or exchange between thetn
( 7,
p. 266)
is particularly evident in two stages of the organization of
interest groups into classes. We find it in the first place, for example,
in the United States of America, where although classes exist they
have not yet become stabilized, but instead exchange and transfer their
elements in continuous flux (8, p.
18).
That
is to say, we find this
exchange in an early stage of class formation when the ruling class
is still concerned with consolidating its power. And the fnore capable
a ruling class is of absorbinz the best men of the olypressed class, the
more solid and dangerous
is
its rule (12, III, p. 649).
The second
stage in which a certain exchange between the classes takes place
is
that immediately preceding a revolution. In times in which the class
struggle approaches its decision, the process of disintegration within
the ruling class and within the whole old society assumes such a vio-
lent and glaring character that a small part of the ruling class re-
nounces it and joins the revolutionary class, the class that carries the
future in its hands.
Just as earlier a part of the nobility went over
to the bourgeoisie, now a part of the bourgeoisie goes over to the pro-
letariat, in particular certain bourgeois ideologists who have achieved
a theoretical understanding of the whole historical movement (14,
pp. 87 f.).
This organization of the proletarians as a class, and that tneans
as a political party (14, p. 87), eventually furnishes the basis of the
class struggle. To repeat
: Every class struggle is a political struggle
(14, p. 87).
It
is the deliberate and articulate conflict between two

Marx's Model
opposed
interests, the
interests, respectively, of preserving and of
revolutionizing the existing institutions and power
relations.
The
formation of
classes as organized
interest groups, the antagonism
between oppressing and oppressed classes, and the resulting revolu-
tionary changes constitute the law of development of all history up
to now. An of-pressed class
is the condition of existence of every
society based on class conflict.
Thus the liberation of the oppressed
class necessarily involves the creation of a new society
(6, p.
i88).
The history of all societies up to the present is the history of class
struggles ( 1 4, p. 8 1 )
THE CLASSLESS SOCIETY
Following these laws of development the proletariat has organ-
ized itself in the womb of bourgeois society, and has opened its strug-
gle against the bourgeoisie.
Does this mean that after the downfall of the old society there
will be a new class rule culminating in a new political authority? No.
The condition of the liberation of the working class is the aboli-
tion of every classy just as the condition of the liberation of the Third
Estate, i.e., the establishment of the bourgeois order^ was the aboli-
tion of all estates.
The working class will in the course of development replace the
old bourgeois society by an association which excludes
classes and
their
conflict, and there will no longer be any
political authority
proper, since it is especially the political authority that provides class
conflict within bourgeois society with
its official expression.
By now the conflict between proletariat and bourgeoisie is a strug-
gle of one class against another, a struggle that means in its highest
expression a
total revolution.
Is there any reason to be surprised
that a society based on class conflict leads to brutal opposition, and
in the last resort to a clash between individuals?
Nobody should say that society develops independently of poli-
tics.
There
is no political m>ovement which is not at the same time
a social movement.
Only in an order of things in which there are no classes and no
class conflicts will social evolutions cease to be political revolutions
(6, pp. i88f.).
SOCIOLOGICAL ELEMENTS OF MARx's THEORY OF CLASS

of his time/ Nevertheless the attempt to present Marx^s approach to
a theory of class conflict largely in his own words is more than an en-
tertaining game. The result can serve as a fruitful basis for some
more general observations which
will prove useful for subsequent
critical considerations. The following elements of Marx's theory of
class appear particularly worth emphasizing for sociological analysis:
1
It is important to realize what Geiger called the "heuristic pur-
pose behind the concept of class" (46, chap, ii) . Wherever Marx used
the concept in a sociological sense, he was not concerned with describ-
ing an existing state of society. He was concerned, rather, with the
analysis of certain laws of social development and of the forces in-
volved in this development. To use the misleading terms of modem
sociology, the heuristic purpose of the concept of class was for Marx
not "static" but "dynamic," not "descriptive" but "analytical." What
these terms may mean and what they cannot mean will have to be dis-
cussed later in some detail. Here it is sufficient to emphasize that for
Marx the theory of class was not a theory of a cross section of society
arrested in time, in particular not a theory of social stratification, but
a tool for the explanation of changes in total societies.
In elaborating
and applying his theory of class, Marx was not guided by the question
"How does a given society in fact look at a given point of time?" but
by the question "How does the structure of a society change?" or, in
his own words, "What is the [economic] law of motion of modern
society?
2. This heuristic purpose explains the often criticized two-class
model underlying the dynamic theory of Marx. Had Marx wanted
to describe his society with photographic accuracy, this model would
indeed have been most unsatisfactory. As a matter of fact, Marx does
refer occasionally (without always using his concept of class in an en-
tirely unambiguous manner) to a multitude of classes. He refers to
the "two great categories into which the interest of the bourgeoisie
is divided—land ownership and capital" (8, p. 43), to the petty bour-
geoisie as a "transitional class" (8, p. 49), and to the class of small
peasants (8, p. 118). But in principle these "intermediate and transi-
tional stages," as Marx significantly calls them, "do not matter for
^ In this sense, Renner's attempt (26, pp. 374 ff.)
to reconstruct this chapter of
Capiat
is closer to Marx in style and content than the attempt here undertaken
to
sketch the most general elements of Marx's theory of class.
Clearly, the claim that I
have written the unwritten
last chapter of Cafital must not be understood literally
in the sense of a philological conjecture. My main purpose has been to offer a syste-
matic presentation of the many isolated statements about
class in the work of Marx.

our investigation"
(12,
III,
p. 941).
Not only are they unstable
entities destined to be drawn sooner or later into the two great whirl-
pools of bourgeoisie and proletariat, but even if this were not the case,
their historical role would be insignificant by comparison with that of
the dominant classes of capitalist society. The concept of class is an
analytical category, or, as Marx says in one of his rare but enlighten-
ing methodological remarks, "real conditions are presented only in
so far as they express their own general type" (12, III, p. 167). The
general type of the real conditions of conflict that generates change,
however,
is the opposition of two dominant
forces, two prevalent
classes.
Geiger has refuted the unjustified objections to Marx's two-class
model so convincingly that further discussion of them is unnecessary
(46, pp. 37 ff.).
But the legitimacy of assuming for analytical pur-
poses the dominance of only two conflicting classes must not blind us
to the fact that Marx has linked with his two-class model a number
of additional postulates whose legitimacy appears rather more dubi-
ous. For Marx the category of class defines one side of an antagonism
which entails the dominant issues of conflict in every society as well
as the direction of its development.
This means for Marx that {a)
every conflict capable of generating structural change
is a class con-
flict, (^) the contents of class conflict always represent the dominant
issues of social conflict, and {c) the two classes stand in the relation
of HegePs "thesis" and "antithesis," in the sense that one
is charac-
terized by the affirmation (or possession) of those features of which
the other
is the complete negation.
It
is at
least open
to dispute
whether this last approach recommends itself in social science. The
other two postulates connected with Marx's two-class model, how-
ever, are empirical generalizations, the untenability of which will have
to be demonstrated. Only if it is freed of these accessories can the two-
class model be conceived as a feasible principle of knowledge.
3. Marx has tried
to argue for the third postulate mentioned
above in the most difficult part of his theory, the part concerned with
the causes and origins of classes. What are the structural conditions
of the formation of social classes?
For simplicity's sake I shall treat
this aspect of Marx's theory of class with reference to his analysis of
capitalist society, since the question remains undecided for the time
being whether this theory can be applied to other types of society at all.
Marx states quite clearly that class conflicts do not originate in
differences of income, or of the sources of income.
His classes are
not tax classes in the sense of the Roman censors. Rather, the determi-

Marx's Model
21
nant of classes is "property." Property, however, must not be under-
stood in terms of purely passive wealth, but as an eflFective force of
production, as "ownership of means of production" and its denial to
others. In this sense, the "relations of production," i.e., the authority
relations resulting from the distribution of eflFective property in the
realm of (industrial) production, constitute the ultimate determinant
of the formation of classes and the development of class conflicts. The
capitalists possess factories and machines, and buy the only property
of the proletarians, their labor power, in order to produce a surplus
value with these means of production and augment their capital.
But our question cannot be answered all that easily. The role of
property in Marx's theory of class poses a problem of interpretation,
and on this interpretation the validity of Marx's theory of class stands
or falls. Does Marx understand, by the relations of property or pro-
duction, the relations of factual control and subordination in the enter-
prises of industrial production—or merely the authority relations in
so far as they are based on the legal title of property?
Does he con-
ceive of property in a loose (sociological) sense—i.e., in terms of the
exclusiveness of legitimate control (in which the manager also exer-
cises property functions)—or merely as a statutary property right in
connection with such control?
Is property for Marx a special case of
authority—or, vice versa, authority a special case of property?
These
questions are of considerable significance.
If one works with the nar-
row concept of property, class conflict
is the specific characteristic of
a form of production which rests on the union of ownership and con-
trol. In this case a society in which control is exercised, for example, by
state functionaries, has by definition neither classes nor class conflicts.
If, on the other hand, one works with the wider concept of property,
class structure
is determined by the authority structure of the enter-
prise, and the category of class becomes at least potentially applicable
to all "relations of production."
Marx does not always make his answer to our questions entirely
clear.
But
it can be shown that his analyses are essentially based on
the narrow, legal concept of property. This procedure, and this pro-
cedure only, enables Marx to link his sociology with his philosophy
of history—a brilliant attempt, but at the same time a fault that robs
his sociological analyses of stringency and conviction, a fault made
no more acceptable by the fact that orthodox Marxists have remained
faithful to their master in this point to the present day.
The most striking evidence for this interpretation can be found in
the preliminary attempts at an analysis of the new form of ownership

----- Page 40 (native) -----
22
Marx's Model
characteristic of joint-stock companies which Marx presents in Volume
III of Cafital. Marx is here explicitly concerned with the phenome-
non that is commonly described today as the separation of ownership
and control. He discusses what he calls the "transformation of the
really functioning capitalist
into a mere
director, an administrator
of alien capital, and of the owners of capital into mere owners, mere
money capitalists" (12, III, p. 477). "In joint-stock companies, func-
tion is separated from capital ownership j thereby labor is entirely sep-
arated from ownership of the means of production, and of surplus
labor" (p. 478). Now, hard though
it
is for ordinary minds to see
why this change in the size and legal structure of industrial enter-
prises should end the conflict between entrepreneurs who can com-
mand and workers who have to obey (the conflict that Marx postulates
for the "pure" capitalist enterprise), Marx ascribes to the joint-stock
company a peculiar place in history. Time and again he describes the
joint-stock company as "private production without the control of
private property" (p. 480), as "the elimination of capital as private
property within the capitalist mode of production itself"
(p. 477),
and even as the "abolition of the capitalist mode of production within
the capitalist mode of production itself" (p. 479). Forhim, the joint-
stock company is "a necessary point on the way to reconverting capital
into the property of the producers, this no longer being the private
property of individual producers but their associated property,
i.e.,
immediate social property" (p. 478).
It is a "point on the way to the
transformation of all functions in the process of reproduction hitherto
connected with capital ownership into mere functions of the associated
producers, into social functions" (p. 478). The joint-stock company,
in other words, is halfway to the communist—and that means class-
less—society.
We cannot pursue here the manifold consequences of this strange
analysis, which—correct as
it may to a certain extent be empirically
(if in a sense hardly intended by Marx)—would certainly have ex-
posed Marx, had he lived longer, to many an awkward question from
his most orthodox adherents.
One point, however,
is convincingly
demonstrated by this analysis: for Marx, the relations of production
as a determinant of class formation were also authority relations, but
they were such only because in the first place they were property rela-
tions in the narrow sense of the distribution of controlling private
ownership. Qua property
relations they are authority relations, and
not vice versa, not qua authority relations property relations.
If,
therefore, the functions of the "director" and the "mere owner," the

----- Page 41 (native) -----
Marx^s Model
23
manager and the stockholder, are separated, this means a first step on
the way to the complete abolition not only of effective private prop-
erty itself, but also of the authority relations dependent on it, and thus
a step on the way to the communist society.
For Marx, classes were
tied to the existence of effective private property.
Their formation,
existence, and struggle can occur only in a society in which some possess
and others are excluded from private ownership and control of the
means of production.
4. One of the critical pivots of Marx^s theory of class is the undis-
puted identification of economic and political power and authority.
Although classes are founded on the "relations of production,"
i.e.,
the distribution of effective property in the narrow sphere of com-
modity production, they become socially significant only in the politi-
cal sphere.
But both these spheres are inseparable.
"The political
power" of a class arises for Marx "from the relations of production"
(5, p. 455). The relations of production are "the final secret, the
hidden basis of the whole construction of society"
(
1 2, III, p. 842 )
•,
industrial classes are eo ipso also social
classes, and industrial
class
conflict
is political class conflict.
Nowhere has Marx explicitly dis-
cussed the basis of this empirical proposition—nor has he seen suf-
ficiently clearly that it is an empirical proposition rather than a postu-
late or premise. The thesis that political conditions are determined
by industrial conditions seems to stem, for him, from the generalized
assertion of an absolute and universal primacy of production over all
other structures of economy and society.
It is evident that a postulate
of this kind requires empirical testj how it fares in this test will have
to be shown.
5.
Relatively thoroughly,
if nowhere systematically, Marx has
described the steps of the process by which groupings in the form of
classes emerge from conditions of social structure.
For Marx, the
first stage of this process of the formation of classes is given directly
by the distribution of effective private property.
Possession and non-
possession of effective private property create two peculiar "common
situations," "conditions of life," or class situations. These class situa-
tions have three complementary aspects: {a) that of the mere distri-
bution of effective property,
i.e., of possession or nonpossession of
means of production and of authority 5
{b) that of the possession or
nonpossession of goods and values gratifying personal needs, i.e., the
"rewards" of modern sociology; and {c) that of the common situa-
tionally determined interests of those who share a class situation. By
common interest in Marx's sense
is not meant a conscious tendency

----- Page 42 (native) -----
24
Marx's Model
of individual desires, but a potentially unconscious (or "falsely con-
scious") tendency of actual behavior shared by people in a common
class situation. Common interests exist, as Marx says, "not merely
in the imagination,
.
.
.
but above all in reality as the mutual de-
pendence of the individuals among whom labor is divided" (13, II,
p. 23).
This
is a difficult notion j for we are used to conceiving of
interests above all on a psychological level. For the time being, how-
ever, we shall put off considering in what sense a concept of "objective
interests" that "exist as" real conditions may be useful. At this point
we merely conclude that Marx's theory of class formation starts with
the postulate of a common class situation, the main components of
which are a common relation to effective private property, a common
socio-economic situation, and a common tendency of actual behavior
determined by "objective" interests.
In accordance with the premises of the theory of class, we already
find, from this point of view, a fundamental dichotomy of class situa-
tions in any given society, and of the members of a society by their class
situations.
Occasionally, Marx refers to the aggregates thus defined
as classes. "In so far as millions of families live under economic con-
ditions which separate their way of life, their interests, and their edu-
cation from those of other classes and oppose them to these, they con-
stitute a class" (8, p. 104). The concept of class as defined so far cor-
responds to Max Weber's later formulation, " 'Class' shall mean any
group of persons in a common class situation" (33«, p. 177).* How-
ever, this definition has its problems.
It has to be asked whether a
common situation is sufficient to constitute a group in the strict sense
of this term.
If—as can be shown—this is not the case, it remains to
be asked how an aggregate of people who are merely situated identi-
cally, without having any contact or coherence, can become an effective
force in social conflict and change. Marx has asked this question, and
he therefore emphasizes at many points that the mere "gap between
the conditions of life," the mere "identity of interests" and class situa-
tions, is a necessary but by no means sufficient condition of the forma-
tion of classes. He continues therefore in the passage quoted above:
"In so far as there is a merely local contact [among people in a com-
mon class situation]—in so far as the identity of their interests does
^ As a matter of fact, Weber
is well aware of the problem under discussion. He
therefore distinguishes "property classes" (as "not 'dynamic' ") from "income classes"
and "social classes."
However, since Weber describes
all three classes as consisting of
all people in a common
(if differently defined)
class situation, his theory of class lacks
the analytical strength of Marx's, which
is much more precise on this point.

not produce a community, national association, and political organi-
zation—they do not constitute a class. They are therefore unable to
make their class interest heard.
.
.
."(8, p. 104).
6. This may well be the most important step in Marx's theory
of class formation:
Classes do not constitute themselves as such until
they participate in political conflicts as organized groups.
Although
Marx occasionally uses the concept of class in a less determinate, more
comprehensive sense, a multitude of statements leave little doubt that
for him class formation and class conflict were phenomena belonging
to the sphere of politics. "As long as the proletariat has not sufficiently
developed to organize itself as a class,
.
.
.
the struggle of the pro-
letariat with the bourgeoisie has not yet assumed a political character"
(6, p. 142). This means conversely that the carriers of class conflict
have organized themselves as classes, and have become classes, only
if class conflict has assumed a political character.
For Marx, this last stage of class formation has two complemen-
tary aspects. On the factual level of social structure
it involves the
association of people who share a class situation in a strict group, party,
or political organization. Marx refers to the "organization of the
proletarians as a class, and that means as a political party" (14, p. 87).
On the normative and ideological level of social structure it involves
the articulation of "class-consciousness,"
i.e., the transformation of
"objective"
class
interests
into
subjectively
conscious, formulated
goals of organized action. The complete class is characterized not by a
common though unconscious direction of behavior, but by its conscious
action toward formulated goals.
7. Marx's theory of class formation
is embedded in his work in
a wider theory of class conflict as the moving force of social change.
However, the elements of this wider theory are only partly of a so-
ciological nature.
It contains a number of theses whose validity can no
longer be tested by empirical research.
In summarizing those ele-
ments of Marx's theory of class conflict that are of potential use to the
sociologist, we soon reach the point at which Marx the sociologist and
Marx the philosopher joined forces:
{a)
In every society there
is possession of and exclusion from
effective private property.
In every society there is therefore posses-
sion of and exclusion from legitimate power. The "relations of pro-
duction" determine different
class situations in the sense indicated
above.
{b)
Differentiation of
class
situations toward the extremes of

----- Page 44 (native) -----
26
Marx's Model
possession of and exclusion from property and power increases as a
society develops.
{c) As the gap between class situations grows, the conditions of
class formation—i.e., of
political organization and of the
explicit
formulation of class Interests—mature. The political class struggle
between "oppressors" and "oppressed" begins.
{d) At its climax this conflict produces a revolutionary change, in
which the hitherto ruling class loses Its power position and is replaced
by the hitherto oppressed class. A new society emerges. In which a new
oppressed class grows up, and the process of class formation and class
conflict starts anew.
It will prove necessary to subject this wider theory of Marx to
severe criticism from a sociological point of view,^ even though the
most problematical aspects of Marx^s theory, such as the notion of a
classless society, have so far been left out of consideration. Here we
are concerned merely with a resume of the sociological elements of
Marx's theory of class.
It is, as we can say now, a theory of structural
change by revolutions based on conflicts between antagonistic interest
groups.
Marx describes in
detail the structural conditions and the
process of formation of these interest groups.
Less elaborately, but
clearly enough, he also describes the process of conflict between these
groups and its solution in revolutionary changes.
8.
Before we leave Marx's sociology one more formal character-
istic of his theory of class warrants recognition, since
it Is not without
significance for recent sociological theory. By analyzing the change of
social structures In terms of the categories mentioned, Marx Intro-
duces at least implicitly a certain image of society. Although an image
of society of this kind may not be of immediate empirical relevance
for sociological research. It can nevertheless become a measure of the
proximity of a theoretical construction to reality, and
it serves im-
portant functions as a guide to problems of research.^"
® This holds in particular for propositions
{a) and {b), which can only be em-
pirical generalizations and are
as such untenable even
if Marx abandons them
arbi-
trarily for the two societies he invented:
the "original society" and the "final society"
of history.
Proposition (c)
is also problematical; see the section on "class conflict and
revolution" in Chapter IV.
Generally speaking,
it
is my intention in this chapter
at
least
in
so
far
as sociological questions
are concerned—to
indicate
the
points of
departure of criticism, but to postpone the criticism
itself.
^° See Chapter III, pp. 112
ff., and Chapter V, pp. 157
ff., for a more elaborate
discussion of "images of society."

----- Page 45 (native) -----
Marx's Model
l-j
For Marx, society is not primarily a smoothly functioning order
of the form of a social organism, a social system, or a static social
fabric.
Its dominant characteristic
is, rather, the continuous change
of not only its elements, but its very structural form. This change in
turn bears witness to the presence of conflicts as an essential feature
of every society.
Conflicts are not random j they are a systematic prod-
uct of the structure of society itself. According to this image, there is
no order except in the regularity of change.
"Without conflict no
progress: this is the law which civilization has followed to the present
day" (6, p. 80)."
This image of society stands in clear contradiction to the images
which lie at the basis of the considerations of some recent sociologists.
At the same time, it appears considerably more useful for the solution
of many problems of sociological analysis than all analogies, explicit or
implicit, between society and organism, or society and one or another
(essentially "closed")
functional system. The reality of society
is
conflict and flux.
Despite our radical criticism of Marx's theory of
class, this implication may therefore be retained as a fruitful heuristic
principle.
In the imaginary chapter of Capital above, I have deliberately
emphasized the nonsociological elements of Marx's theory of class
rather less than Marx himself would have done. Now, too, I shall
discuss them less elaborately than the sociological elements, since this
study is intended not as a philosophical discussion or merely as a criti-
cism of Marx, but rather as a means of posing anew the problem of
social conflict and
its sociological analysis, and furnishing some ele-
ments of its solution.
Nevertheless, it would hardly be justifiable to
represent Marx's theory of class and subject it to critical examination
without mentioning its nonsociological elements.
A word of explanation may be in place as to the identification of
its nonsociological elements with
its "philosophical" elements.
It
seems to me that it can be shown that the work of Marx falls into two
^^ Unfortunately, the clause "to the present day"
is meant to imply that one day
this law will no longer hold.
Here
as elsewhere Marx has vitiated the value of his
sociology by Hegelian
philosophical
additions of
litüe
plausibility.
The
image of
society indicated in the last paragraph
is for Marx an image of historical societies in
the period of alienation.
Communist society
(as well
as the early communal society
of Marx's philosophical imagination)
is different, and indeed in many ways not dis-
similar to the constructions of modern sociological theory.

separable parts
(c£. 225). On the one hand, there are categories,
hypotheses, and theories which permit empirical test, i.e., which either
can be
falsified themselves by empirical
observations, or allow of
derivations that can be so falsified.
This is true, for example, of the
proposition that structural change
is a result of class conflicts.
If I
use the term "sociological" for such elements of the work of Marx,
I am well aware that
it is too narrow with respect to Marx^s strictly
economic propositions and theories.
In the case of the theory of class,
however, it is undoubtedly applicable.
On the other hand, the work of Marx contains postulates and
theories utterly removed from the possibility of empirical test. Propo-
sitions such as that capitalist society is the last class society of history,
or that communist society leads to a complete realization of human
freedom, can be disputed and denied, but they cannot be refuted with
the tools of science. To be more precise,
it
is impossible to imagine
empirical data which would falsify these postulates or their deriva-
tions. For such assertions, which are irrefutable in principle, I use the
term "philosophical." This expression is evidently as little exhaustive
in terms of the content and method of philosophy as is the term "socio-
logical" in the meaning here proposed for sociology. The attributes
"sociological" and "philosophical" signify in this context a difference
in the logical status of propositions.
Marx's theory of class contains
elements of both kinds.
Indeed, nowhere has Marx linked both kinds
of propositions as cleverly, and hence as deceptively, as in his theory
of class.
Marx's conception of the communist society, of its role in history,
and of the time of its arrival is the pivotal point of the connection be-
tween the philosophical and the sociological elements of his theory
of class.
Later, we shall have to consider sense and nonsense in the
notion of a classless society from a sociological point of view. Here we
are concerned with the place of the classless society in Marx's philoso-
phy of history.
In an earlier study I have tried to show in detail in
what sense the historical process is for Marx a dialectical process of
thesis, antithesis, and synthesis (224).
Not only does this hold for
what is sometimes called the "real dialectics" of history from antique
to feudal and further to capitalist society, but
it holds above all for
the total process of history. For Marx, the supreme meaning and law
of historical development lies in the birth of human freedom, or of
free man by human labor.
In
its beginning there
is the postulated
reality of an original society, in which man is "with himself" and free,
though as yet only in a restrained and partial fashion.
Private prop-

erty, classes and class conflict, division of labor, and inequality are
absent from this society.
But man
is still quasi-unborn j he has not
developed his talents yet, not recognized his potentialities j his free-
dom
is a dull freedom, without conscious
activity and constrained
by extraneous purposes. This original society breaks up with the ap-
pearance of private property and the division of labor, and is trans-
formed into its antithesis.
Then begins a second stage of human development, which com-
prises all known history.
In this stage, man is alienated from himself.
Division of labor and private property create relations of domination
and subjection, class formations, and class struggles in ever-changing
patterns.
Indeed, private property
is the specific difference of this
second stage of the historical process, as
it had been the principle of
social inequality and social organization for Locke and Hume, Fergu-
son and Millar.
In this stage man
is unfreej but the growth of the
forces of production leads him to develop ever new potentialities and
talents. He cannot develop these talents to the full so long as he
is
alienated and enslaved, but they are present now within him. For all
men to develop all their talents in all directions by purpose-free ac-
tivity, all that
is needed
is regained liberty, de-alienation.
This is realized by the synthesis of classless society.
It is classless,
because in
it there
is no private property, and there are therefore
by virtue of Marx's (false) conception of property—no relations of
authority, no class conflicts.
It is a synthesis, because
it combines the
dull liberty of original society and the differentiated human poten-
tialities of alienation in the triple sense of the Hegelian concept;
it
abolishes them as such and yet preserves them on a higher level."
In
this society man realizes himself as a free being.
Thus formulated, Marx's philosophy of history is little more than
Hegel's theory of history as the realization of the spirit of freedom
*'turned upside down."
In this formulation also, Marx's philosophy
of history is not directly relevant to the sociological theory of class.
However, Marx joins the two by a fascinating trick of definition and
thereby manages to give his philosophy the appearance of empirical
validity, and his sociology the force of indubitable truth. As long as
these two logical bastards were not recognized as such, they could
have, singly and combined, that political effect so well known today.
"^ The word Hegel and Marx use most frequently to characterize the synthesis
of the dialectical process
is aujheben.
Even
as a word,
it has three meanings,
all of
which were intended by Hegel and Marx: (l)
to suspend or abolish, (2)
to elevate or
lift to a higher level, (3)
to preserve or maintain.

Marx^s Model
It might seem that the concept of class is not really necessary for
Marx^s philosophy of history.
In speaking of the transition from the
original society to the state of alienation, Marx sees the cause of this
"fall of man" in private property. Correspondingly, the central event
of the transition from the state of alienation to the realm of liberty
is the abolition of efiFective private property.
All other symptoms of
alienation, such as classes and power relations, the state and the divi-
sion of labor,^^ also disappear.
But they almost look like empirical
trimmings with no particular relation to the argument—unless they
are asserted to be dependent on private property.
In a logically independent approach Marx investigates the society
of his time. There he notes empirically three factors, among others:
{a) the presence of a conflict between social groups (classes), {b) the
presence of efiFective private property, and {c) the presence of rela-
tions of domination and subjection. He believes furthermore that he
can discern in this society a tendency for private property to be abol-
ished and replaced by communal property—an observation which at
least to some extent has proved correct. And what happens if efiFective
private property disappears?
It
is precisely at this point that Marx
jumps from sociology into philosophy and back by introducing his
undoubtedly brilliant trick of definition. By asserting the dependence
of classes on relations of domination and subjection, and the depend-
ence of these relations on the possession of or exclusion from efiFective
private capital,^* he makes on the one hand empirically private prop-
erty, on the other hand philosophically social classes, the central fac-
tor of his analyses. One can retrace step by step the thought process
to which Marx has succumbed at this point.
It
is not the thought
process of the empirical scientist who seeks only piecemeal knowledge
and expects only piecemeal progress, but that of the system builder
who suddenly finds that everything fits!
For if private property dis-
appears (empirical hypothesis), then there are no longer classes (trick
of definition)
!
If there are no longer any classes, there is no alienation
(speculative postulate).
The realm of liberty
is realized on earth
^^ Marx's considerations are least unambiguous
in
this question of the
division
of labor. Thus when Marx and Engels try to prove in their German Ideology that
there will be no division of labor in communist society,
their proof remains under-
standably unconvincing and
is really confined
to the
thesis that the
final society will
replace the "specialist," or "detail man," by the "universal man."
^* An assertion which
is of course understandable in view of the factual identity
of ownership and control in early industrial capitalism, but which
is unpardonable as
a generalization.

(philosophical idea). Had Marx, conversely, defined private prop-
erty by authority relations, his empirical observation would not have
"fitted," and he would have had to drop his philosophy of history.
For effective private property may disappear empirically, but au-
thority relations can do so only by the magic
trick of the system
maniac.^'
There would be no objection to joining philosophy and sociology,
if this were done without consequences detrimental to sociology. This
is not, however, the case here.
Marx's philosophy has forced him to
betray his sociology, and this betrayal forces us to separate the two
elements relentlessly.
Far-reaching as this assertion may sound,
it
can easily be justified by reference to Marx's work, as a few examples
may show:
1
The dogmatic conj unction of classes and effective private prop-
erty documents in itself a betrayal of sociology. Perhaps a Marx with-
out the Marxian philosophy of history would have realized that power
and authority are not tied to the legal title of property. Marx himself
could not realize this, and certainly could not admit it, for had he done
so, his philosophical conception of the classless society would have
become impossible both empirically and intellectually. In other words,
he had either to regard the joint-stock company as a transitional form
on the way to the classless society, or to abandon the philosophy ac-
cording to which private property—and not the possession of or exclu-
sion from authority—is the differentia sfecifca of alienation and the
determining factor of classes.
2.
In asserting the universality of class conflict
in the stage of
alienation, Marx has again saved his philosophy and sacrificed his
sociology. "The history of all societies up to the present is the history
of class struggles."
This seemingly empirical sentence
is in reality
but a reformulation of the philosophical postulate that links alienation
(and thereby all known history), private property, and the classes.
It
becomes a dogma that prevents open, unprejudiced research from
developing. There is, moreover, a strange irony in the fact that the
same Marx who so often attacked the uncritical assertion that private
property is universal, introduces the same assertion in a concealed way
but equally uncritically by speaking of the universality of
classes,
which for him are tied to the presence of private property.
3. Marx's analysis of his own capitalist society
is evidently col-
^° The thesis of this argument was intimated first by Schumpeter. Cf. 73, pp. 19
f.

Marx's Model
ored by his sociologically nonsensical conviction that it is the last class
society in history. Thus his assertions of the extraordinary intensity
of class conflict in this society and of the messianic role of the prole-
tariat have little to do with empirical knowledge. They invest the
concept of class with an importance and a measure of exclusiveness in
sociological analysis which
is clearly not warranted by historical ex-
perience (although
it has blinded generations of sociologists).
4.
Finally, the application of dialectics as the asserted inherent
law of historical development involves a betrayal of sociology in the
interests of philosophy.
This is especially evident in the misleading
and sociologically untenable thesis that structural change is necessarily
of a revolutionary character—once again a thesis unfortunately im-
pressive enough to divert the eyes of social scientists away from real
changes.
Several further points of lesser importance could be mentioned
at which sociological and philosophical elements are linked in Marx's
theory of class. However, such points are not our concern here. We
are concerned rather with a rough sketch of the nonsociological as-
pects of Marx's theory of class, and at the same time with finding a
point of departure for their radical separation from the sociological
aspects. For the sociologist, there can be no doubt that this separation
is necessary. But it might be asked: Why all this effort? Why not a
completely new and more fruitful approach?
There are two answers
to these questions:
First, it is often useful to start with a critical review
of the errors of earlier authors so that one can avoid, them oneself.
Second, Marx's theory of class, if freed of all speculative trimmings,
contains many insights and useful approaches, which we can scarcely
afford to ignore.
Our discussion has brought out the main lines of Marx's view of
the society of his time and its development. To this view some details
may be added now which can usefully serve as a point of departure for
the analysis of factual changes in industrial societies since Marx, in
so far as they relate to the class structure of these societies. Following
Marx, we shall use the term "capitalist society" without defining
it
precisely for the time being.
But unlike Marx, we shall ignore the
philosophical elements of his analysis and renounce the cheap triumph
of "refuting" speculative prophecies by empirical data.
According to Marx, capitalist society
is a class society.
There
is
in this society a category of persons who possess effective private prop-

----- Page 51 (native) -----
Marx's Model
33
erty, and another category of those who have no such property. The
former is called capital or bourgeoisie, the latter wage labor or pro-
letariat. The typical private property of capitalist society consists of
the means of industrial production,
i.e., factories, machines, and the
like, or capital. The owners or capitalists directly control their means
of production j the nonowners or wage laborers are dependent, by the
labor contract, on the means of production and their owners. Property
and power and the exclusion from both go together; they "correlate."
There is also a correlation between these factors on the one hand, and
socio-economic position on the other hand: the capitalists are wealthy,
secure, and have high status j the wage laborers are lacking a sub-
sistence minimum.
This difference in position makes for conflicting
interests and conflicting groupings—classes—which fight each other
at first on the local level of the individual enterprise, eventually on
the political level.
There are, of course, persons in capitalist society—such as land-
lords, independent craftsmen and small businessmen, peasants, and
intellectuals—who stand outside this tension and whose interests are
not directly afFected by it. These groups, however, not only decrease
in numerical importance but increasingly lose their influence on the
conflicts determining the structure of society. The capitalist bour-
geoisie and its counterpart, the industrial proletariat, move more and
more into the center of the social process. Their conflicts dominate the
scene of capitalist class society and draw all other groups into their
orbit or condemn them to complete insignificance.
Society
is domi-
nated by the antagonism between the interests of those who defend
their possession of eff^ective private property and those who elevate
their nonpossession into a demand for a complete change of the prop-
erty relations.
This sketch of Marx^s view of capitalist society
is incomplete in
one important point.
It describes a structure, and not
its process of
development, whereas
it
is on the latter count that Marx made his
sociologically important contribution to social analysis. Marx tried,
at times retrospectively, more often predictively, to determine the
tendencies of change that can be derived from this structure.
With
respect to the development of class structure he emphasized in particu-
lar the following four processes
I.
Inherent in capitalist society, there is a tendency for the classes
to polarize increasingly. "The whole society breaks up more and more
into two great hostile camps, two great, directly antagonistic classes:
bourgeoisie and proletariat" ( 14, p. 7). Here, the model of two domi-

----- Page 52 (native) -----
34
Marx*s Model
nant classes is no longer merely a heuristic postulate, but describes a
factual condition.
"The earlier petty bourgeoisie, the small indus-
trialists, the merchants and rentiers, the craftsmen and peasants, all
these classes sink down into the proletariat" (14, p. 16).
It is really
misleading to speak of two "great" classes, since social development,
according to Marx, produces a polarized class society with a relatively
small ruling class of capitalists and an extraordinarily large oppressed
class of wage laborers.
2. As the classes polarize, their class situations become increas-
ingly extreme. On the one hand, the wealth of the bourgeoisie
is
swelled by larger profits based on increasing productivity as well as
by the progressive concentration of capital in the hands of a few indi-
viduals. "One capitalist kills many others" (12, 1, p. 803). On the
other hand, "with the continuously decreasing number of capital mag-
nates who usurp and monopolize
all advantages of this process of
change
.
.
.
[comes an increase in]
the mass of poverty, of pres-
sure, of slavery, of perversion, of exploitation, but also of revolt on
the part of a working class permanently increasing in size which
is
skilled, united, and organized by the mechanism of the capitalist mode
of production itself" (12, I, p. 803).
Here, the so-called theory of
pauperization has its place, according to which the poverty of the pro-
letariat grows with the expansion of production by virtue of a law
postulated as inherent in a capitalist economy.
3. At the same time, the two classes become more and more ho-
mogeneous internally.
In the beginning of this process, the classes
are clearly delimited from
the
outside, but
rather heterogeneous
within. Marx says of the bourgeoisie that its members "have identical
interests in so far as they form a class in opposition to another class,"
but "contradictory and conflicting interests as soon as they are con-
fronted with themselves" (6, p. 140).
Analogously, the proletariat
is not,
in the beginning, a "class for itself."
However, a number
of processes mold the different constituents of the classes into uniform
groups without
significant internal
differences or
conflicts.
"More
and more the
collisions between individual workers and bourgeois
assume the character of collisions of two classes" (14, p. 87).
This
is partly due to pressure from without, such as the growing intensity
of the class struggle. Partly it is the effect of social and even technical
factors.
In the case of the proletariat Marx refers on the one hand to
the growing extent of class organization as a unifying factor, on the
other hand to the "tendency of equalizing and leveling in work proc-
esses" within industry itself (12, I, p. 441), i.e., the reduction of all

----- Page 53 (native) -----
Marx's Model
35
workers to unskilled laborers by the technical development of produc-
tion.
Similarly, a combination of economic, and in the narrow sense
social, factors unites the bourgeoisie as a class.
4. Once history has carried these tendencies of development to
their extremes, the point is reached at which the fabric of the existing
social structure breaks and a revolution terminates capitalist society.
The hitherto oppressed proletariat assumes power j efFective private
property
is socialized j
classes cease to
exist j the state
is withering
away. The proletarian revolution inaugurates the communist, class-
less society.
Marx's image of capitalist society is the image of a society under-
going a process of radical change.
This change culminates in a revo-
lutionary act, into which all earlier developments converge and from
which all later developments depart. The executors of this process are
structurally generated, organized human interest groups—^the classes.
One of these—the bourgeoisie—defends with
sinking chances
of
success the existing distribution of property, and with
it the whole
social status quo. The other one—the proletariat—attacks this status
quo with growing success until the day on which its interests become
reality, the values of a new society. The capitalist form of economic
and social structure
is doomed, and the classes are
its gravediggers.
At this point in our considerations we shall depart from Marx.
His theory of class provides the background of subsequent argument,
his analysis of capitalist class society that of later analyses.
If we suc-
ceed in refuting the sociological theories of Marx or the hypotheses
derived from them, we have good reason to rejoice. For science grows
by the refutation of accepted propositions and theories, and not by
their stubborn retention.

Changes in the Structure of Industrial Societies
Since Marx
CAPITALISM VERSUS INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY
It is a commonplace today that many of Marx's predictions have
been refuted by the social development of industrial
societies over
the past century.
But while commonplaces of this kind can be an
excuse for silence, they are also a challenge.
If a commonplace
is
repeated too often, it makes one wonder whether those who repeat it
realize what they are saying and are able to substantiate their asser-
tions.
In sociological literature, there has been, to my knowledge, but
one attempt to present a systematic account of the social changes that
molded industrial societies in forms unforeseen by Marx, namely,
Theodor Geiger's analysis of the Class Society in the Melting-Pot.
This account, while useful, is rather less than exhaustive, to say noth-
ing of the fact that Geiger fails to present these changes with a view
to formulating a new and better theory of social conflict and change
than was provided by Marx.^
If, therefore, I propose to explore in
this chapter some of the important changes in the structure of indus-
trial societies since Marx, I do so with a double purpose.
First, I want
to indicate certain patterns of social development that justify speaking
of Marx's theory of class as being falsified by empirical observations.
Second, however, I intend to discuss those features of advanced in-
dustrial societies which have to be accounted for by a theory of con-
flict and change that claims to be applicable not merely to capitalist
societies but to industrial societies in general. For both these purposes,
and in the context of a study that is largely analytical in nature,
it is
not necessary to waste much time and space in recounting well-known
facts of development.
Accordingly, this chapter, although based on
observations and empirical generalizations, will be devoted to analyses
rather than descriptions of historical trends, and will thus clear the
ground for our further considerations.

Marx dealt with what he called "bourgeois" or "capitalist" so-
ciety. By contrast, the title of this study and of this chapter refers to
"industrial society."
In describing modern societies, social scientists
have tended to use these concepts either indiscriminately or confus-
ingly. There are several reasons for this confusion. "Whether con-
temporary Britain, or contemporary America, can properly be de-
scribed as capitalist societies is partly a question of fact and partly a
question of terminology" (T. Bottomore, 37, p. 13 n).
In so far as
it is a question of terminology, i.e., of an essentially arbitrary decision,
political rather than scientific motivations play their part. Some au-
thors—including Bottomore (37) and H. P. Bahrdt ( 1 24)—feel that
in preferring the concept of industrial society, sociologists have aban-
doned the impulses of critical detachment from social reality which
stood at the origin of social science, and which are even today conveyed
by the notion of capitalist society. Those who speak of industrial so-
cieties,
it is claimed, have accepted the existing state of affairs as un-
objectionable in a way in which those who prefer to speak of capitalist
societies have not.
There
is an element of truth in this allegation.
Sociologists cannot be said to be free of the suspicion of ideology be-
cause they investigate, inter alia, such suspicions.
However, despite
this element of truth I propose to ignore the charge of an ideological
bias related to the concepts here in question and concentrate on what
Bottomore calls the "question of fact" involved in the terminological
dispute.
For
it seems to me that despite some evidence to the con-
trary the notions of "capitalist society" and "industrial society" are
not different terms for identical concepts, but in fact signify different
concepts which we have to disentangle in order to clarify the logical
and historical status of our analyses.
"Capitalism" was originally—and still is to some extent—an eco-
nomic concept. The notion of a capitalist society
is an extrapolation
from economic to social relations j
it assumes some formative power
on the part of economic structures if not indeed the thesis that social
institutions and values are but a superstructure on the real basis of
economic conditions. However, not even economists wholly agreed,
or agree, on the characteristics of this "real basis," to say nothing of
its social "superstructure."
In describing the
social and economic
order emerging in consequence of the industrial revolution in the late
eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, Marx emphasized private
ownership of the means of production, the "free" sale of labor, the
production of surplus value, mechanized factory production, and the
existence of classes. Sombart and Max Weber later added the rational

----- Page 56 (native) -----

Changes Since Marx
or rationalist value system, the acquisitive principle, the market char-
acter of the economy. According to Weber,
it is "one of the funda-
mental properties of capitalist private economy that it rationalizes on
the basis of strict calculation, and that
it
is structured systematically
and soberly by the economic effect intended"
( 1 89, p. 61 )
. With de-
ceptive thoroughness, Sombart defines capitalism as "a commercial
organization in which two different groups of the population are con-
nected by the market and cooperate regularly: the owners of the
means of production, who at the same time have control and are the
subjects of the economy, and propertyless mere laborers as objects of
the economy J
it is an organization which is dominated by the acquisi-
tive principle and by economic rationalism" (28, 1, 319). Many fur-
ther "definitions" of capitalism could be quoted here, but they add
little to those of Marx, Weber, and Sombart.^
On the other hand, it is evident by definition that—in Heimann's
words—"capitalism is a historical concept"
: "It signifies one economic
system among other systems realized in history, and it therefore im-
plies the problem of the origin and, possibly, the transformation and
supersedure of capitalism" (177, p. 510). Thus, the derived concept
of a capitalist society also signifies a historical pattern of social struc-
ture that can change and be replaced by new patterns. Here the ques-
tion arises which makes all ambiguities of definition apparent: What
must change for a capitalist system to cease being capitalist?
Let us take, for example, Sombart^s definition quoted above.
It
contains at least seven elements or determinants of capitalism: (i)
the commercial organization, (2) the cooperation of two groups of the
population, (3) the fact that one of these groups simultaneously owns
and controls the means of production, whereas (4) the other group
has no property and is confined to "merely" laboring, (5) their con-
nection by the market, (6) the acquisitive principle, and (7) economic
rationalism. What happens—we must ask—if one of these factors
changes, but all others remain unchanged?
What happens, for ex-
ample, if ownership and control of the means of production are no
^ Apart from
the empirical problem,
all
these "definitions"
also
raise
a logical
problem:
Where,
in
social
science, do
definitions end and
descriptions
begin?
A
more elaborate discussion of this problem would reveal some of the darkest corners of
social science.
In this study,
I shall speak of definitions only with respect to the defi-
nition of concepts in terms of their genus and dijferentia sfecißca, and
I
shall
dis-
tinguish them as such stricdy from statements about objects thus conceptually defined,
which will be referred to at times as "definitions" by contrast to definitions proper.
What matters in a definition
is not that
it
is "complete" (which
is in fact the trouble
with Sombart's "definition" quoted above)
but
that
it
is precise and unambiguous.

----- Page 57 (native) -----
Changes Since Marx
39
longer simultaneous, but everything else remains as before?
Are we
then still dealing with a capitalist system or not?
If, like only too many others, we accept the given definition as in
some sense "true," then there are two equally nonsensical answers to
this question:
either a change of one element of the "definition"
is
seen as "necessarily" involving changes in all the others, so that capi-
talism is superseded j or a change of one element is neglected as a mere
modification, and the concept of capitalism is applied also to systems
which do not fulfill all conditions of the "definition." The first of
these
is Marx^s answer.
It presupposes a whole series of untenable
postulates and becomes a mere trick of definition which may deceive
by
its brilliance, but which cannot convince.
The second and more
frequent answer results in an extension of the term "capitalism" be-
yond the borderline of meaning.
Its "definition" is no longer a defi-
nition, for
it
is lacking a differentia specifica.
One could carry this
procedure ad absurdum by pointing out the limiting case in which the
concept of capitalism becomes identical with the genus economic and
social system. There can be little doubt that neither method
is very
fruitful for historical and sociological analysis.
For the concept of a capitalist economy or society to be useful,
it
is necessary to define it specifically and precisely.
If we try to do so,
a significant fact becomes apparent.
The elements of most of the
traditional definitions of capitalism fall into two distinct groups. On
the one hand, we encounter factors which can be shown to be connected
with industrial production as such, independent of its social, legal, or
economic context:
for example, the participation in production of a
controlling group and a subordinate group, economic rationalism, pos-
sibly some form of a market economy, and other factors to be deter-
mined presently. On the other hand, there appear in these definitions
elements which characterize merely the particular form of industrial
production displayed by the industrializing countries of Europe and
North America in the nineteenth century: above
all the union of
ownership and control, but also the poverty of industrial workers, the
profit motive, and some other features.
It is true that these two groups
of factors occurred together in the particular situation of Europe and
the United States in the nineteenth century. But after the experience
of other types of industrialization we know today that their combina-
tion was, from the point of view of industrialization and its social im-
plications, an accident, or rather the result of certain very special his-
torical configurations.
If some social scientists claimed, and still claim,
that there
is a necessary connection between both groups of factors,

----- Page 58 (native) -----
40
Changes Since Marx
and that therefore both will disappear at the same time, they are ill-
advised j and we shall have to revise this position.
Those factors which can be shown to be generated by the structure
of industrial production, and which cannot disappear, therefore, unless
industry itself disappears, will be associated in this study with the con-
cept of industrial society.
Since it appears evident that industrial pro-
duction is not just a passing guest in history, but will probably be with
us forever in one form or another,
it follows that the concept of an
industrial society is extremely comprehensive. Whenever it is applied
to particular societies
it will require specification.
In general, how-
ever, we retain mechanized commodity production in factories and
enterprises as the distinguishing feature of industrial societies. The
social conditions that correlate with this characteristic can be specified
only by way of empirical analysis.
By contrast, capitalism merely signifies one form of industrial so-
ciety.
Definitions of terms always contain an element of arbitrariness,
and one could certainly define capitalism differently.
However,
it
accords with the definitions of the most acute modern economists to
state that the main elements of capitalism are "private property in
means of production and regulation of the productive process by pri-
vate contract (or management or initiative)."
Schumpeter adds to
this definition of his the factor of "credit creation" (73, p. 167). For
purposes of sociological analysis
it seems advisable—if we want to
retain the concept of a capitalist society at all—to insist on the union
of private ownership and factual control of the instruments of pro-
duction as the distinguishing feature of a capitalist form of society.
Thus we follow Sering in expecting the "typical capitalist" to be "at
the same time the legal owner of his factory, the practical manager
of production, and the supreme commander of his workers" (74, p.
26).
Both terms, "capitalism" and "industrial society," are categories
on a high level of generality.
In analyzing particular societies they
are
applicable, but not very
useful.
They are models
describing
merely the most general features of social structures.^

would have to qualify its classification as a "capitalist" or an "indus-
trial" society, and add many a reference to particular structural vari-
ants, cultural traits, and historical traditions of the society in question.
If, however, we are concerned merely with the analysis of certain gen-
eral structural elements, or with that of a multitude of societies that
share such elements, the categories of "capitalist" and "industrial"
society may be sufficient in themselves. The title of the present study
should be understood in this sense.
Its subject
is not primarily any
particular society, but the conditions of class formation and class con-
flict in industrial society, i.e., in all societies which fulfill the general
conditions of this model of structure.
Having separated the two groups of elements of which most of
the traditional definitions of capitalism are composed, we are now able
to contrast capitalist societies with industrial societies.
Following our
definitions, this means of course contrasting a whole (industrial so-
ciety) with one of its parts (capitalist society).
It is not our intention
here to add another colorful name to the multitude of terms coined
for postcapitalist societies in recent years.
Faced with the choice be-
tween "socialist society," "managerial society," "bureaucratic society,"
"advanced industrial society," and other such terms, I have no particu-
lar preference. In any case no decision is needed here, for the purpose
of a confrontation of capitalist and industrial society is evidently one
of generalization.
In the argument of this section I have deliberately
not referred to classes and class conflicts. One of the main questions
which the present investigation
is supposed to answer
is: Do classes
and class conflicts belong to that group of phenomena by which only
the capitalist type of industrial society is characterized, or is their exist-
ence a consequence of industrial production itself, and are they there-
fore a lasting feature of industrial societies?
This question will ac-
company us throughout the following analysis of changes in the struc-
ture of industrial societies since Marx.
OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL, OR THE DECOMPOSITION OF CAPITAL
Marx was right in seeking the root of social change in capitalist
society in the sphere of industrial production, but the direction these
changes took turned out to be directly contrary to Marx's expectations.
With respect to capital, he had, in his later years, at least a vision of
what was going to happen, as his brief and somewhat puzzled analysis
of joint-stock companies shows.
Joint-stock companies were legally
recognized in Germany, England, France, and the United States in
the second half of the nineteenth century. Laws often indicate the

conclusion of social developments, and indeed early forms of joint-
stock companies can be traced back at least to the commercial com-
panies and trade societies of the seventeenth century.
But
it was in
the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries that this type of enter-
prise first gained wide recognition and expanded into all branches of
economic activity.
Today, more than two-thirds of all companies in
advanced industrial societies are joint-stock companies, and their prop-
erty exceeds four-fifths of the total property in economic enterprises.
The enterprise owned and run by an individual, or even a family, has
long ceased
to be the dominant pattern of economic organization.
Moreover, the stock of companies is dispersed fairly widely. Three
per cent of the adult population of the Federal Republic of Germany,
and approximately 8 per cent of that of the United States, own one
or more shares of joint-stock companies.
Probably the proportion in
other countries is somewhere between these extremes.* For purposes
of the present analysis, we may add to joint-stock companies the co-
operative enterprises and those owned by the state, which command
an ever-increasing proportion of the national wealth in contemporary
societies. All these together, and their growth in the last decade, leave
little doubt about the significance of this change.
It is not surprising that sociologists should have shared, from an
early date, the interest of lawyers and economists in these new and
rapidly expanding types of organization. There
is, moreover, on the
whole an astonishing degree of consensus among sociologists on the
implications of joint-stock companies for the structure of industrial
enterprises, and for the wider structure of society.
If one wants to
distinguish between points of view, one might contrast a rather more
radical with a somewhat conservative interpretation of this phenome-
non. Marx was, in this sense, the founder of the radical school j sur-
prisingly enough, however, most of his later adherents took the more
conservative view.
According to the radical view, joint-stock companies involve a
complete break with earlier capitalist traditions. By separating what
has come to be called ownership and control, they give rise to a new
group of managers who are utterly
different from
their
capitalist
predecessors.
Thus for Marx, the joint-stock company involves a
complete alienation of capital "from the real producers, and its oppo-
sition as alien property to all individuals really participating in pro-

duction, from the manager down to the last day-laborer" (12, III,
p. 478).
In other words, by separating ownership and control, the
joint-stock company reduces the distance between manager and worker
while at the same time removing the owners altogether from the
sphere of production and thereby isolating their function as exploiters
of others.
It is merely a step from this kind of analysis to the thesis
that, as Renner has it, the "capitalists without function" yield to the
"functionaries without capital," and that this new ruling group of
industry bears little resemblance to the old "full capitalists" (71, pp.
182, 198). Burnham, Geiger, Sering, and others followed Marx (and
Renner)
in this radical interpretation of the social effects of joint-
stock companies.
The conservative view, on the other hand, holds that the conse-
quences of the apparent separation of ownership and control have
been vastly overrated.
It is argued that in fact owners and controllers,
i.e., stockholders and managers,
are a
fairly homogeneous group.
There are often direct connections between them, and where this
is
not the case, their outlook is sufficiently similar to justify insisting on
the old assumption of a homogeneous class of capitalists opposed to
an equally homogeneous class of laborers.
This view
is not often
heard in the West nowadays, although traces of it are evident in the
work of C. Wright Mills (62, 63).
It may be added that this con-
servative view is clearly contrary to Marx's own analysis.
We cannot here exhaust the complex subject of ownership and
control, but it seems desirable not to leave the subject without consid-
ering which of these two views seems more plausible and appropriate.
There can be little doubt that the social structure of joint-stock com-
panies as well as cooperative and state-owned enterprises differs from
that of the classical capitalist enterprise, and that therefore a transition
from the latter to the former is a process of social change. However,
what type of change are we dealing with
in this problem?
Is
it a
change involving the transference of certain rights and duties attached
to social positions from an old to a new group? Or is it a change that
involves some rearrangement of the positions endowed with rights
and duties themselves?
These questions are not quite as rhetorical as
they may sound.
In fact, I would claim that the separation of owner-
ship and control involved both a change in the structure of social posi-
tions and a change in the recruitment of personnel to these positions.
But
it
is evident that, in the
first place, joint-stock companies differ
from capitalist enterprises in the structure of their leading positions.
In the sphere with which we are here concerned, the process of transi-

44
Changes Since Marx
tion from capitalist enterprises to joint-stock companies can be de-
scribed as a process of role differentiation. The roles of owner and
manager, originally combined in the position of the capitalist, have
been separated and distributed over two positions, those of stockholder
and executive.^
At the very least, this process of differentiation means that two
physical entities occupy the positions formerly occupied by one.
But
this is not all. Apart from its manifest effects, the separation of owner-
ship and control has a number of latent effects of even greater im-
portance j i.e., it seems clear that the resulting positions, those of stock-
holder and executive, differ not only with respect to the obvious rights
and duties of their incumbents, but also in other respects.
Generally,
the
"capitalist without
function"
is indeed,
as Marx emphasized,
alienated from production, i.e., largely removed from the enterprise
whose stock he owns. He does not participate in the day-to-day life
of the enterprise, and above all he does not have a defined place in the
formal hierarchy of authority in the enterprise. The "functionary
without capital," on the other hand, has this place, although he typi-
cally has no property in the enterprise which he runs."
From the point of view of the social structure of industrial enter-
prises, this means a significant change in the basis of legitimacy of
entrepreneurial authority. The old-style capitalist exercised authority
because he owned the instruments of production.
The exercise of
authority was part and parcel of his property rights, as indeed prop-
erty may always be regarded from one point of view as simply an
institutionalized form of authority over others. By contrast to this
legitimation by property, the authority of the manager resembles in
many ways that of the heads of political institutions.
It
is true that
even for the manager property has not ceased to function as a basis of
authority. The right of the manager to command and expect obedience
accrues in part from the property rights delegated to him by the share-
holders, acting either as a group or through an elected board of direc-
° In
a more extensive analysis,
it would have to be recognized that
this process
of differentiation involved not only two, hut
at
least three,
roles and positions: the
third being that of investor or "finance capitalist" (Hilfcrding).
Renner would add
even more:
"Three capitalist character masks have stepped into the place of the one
full capitalist: the producer owning the capital of production in the mask of the entre-
preneur, the commercial capitalist in the character mask of the businessman, and the
financial capitalist" (71, p.
175).
® In 1935, members of management in
i 55 of the 200 largest American corpora-
tions had on the average no more than
i
. 74 per cent of the ordinary shares of their
enterprises
(cf. 159, p. 135).

tors.
But besides these delegated property rights, the manager, by
virtue of his more immediate contact with the participants of produc-
tion, has to seek a second, and often more important, basis of legiti-
macy for his authority, namely, some kind of consensus among those
who are bound to obey his commands. Typically, this consensus merely
takes the form of an absence of dissensus.
However, the manager,
unlike the "full capitalist," can ill afford to exercise his authority in
direct and deliberate contravention to the wishes and interests of his
subordinates. The mechanisms by which manual and clerical workers
who object to a member of top management can make their interests
felt are complex and largely unregulated.^ But there are such mecha-
nisms, and managers have ways and means to forestall their being
brought to bear.
In this sense, the "human relations" movement
is
nothing but a symptom of the changing basis of legitimacy of entre-
preneurial authority once ownership and control are separated.*
With the differentiation of capitalist roles, the composition of the
entrepreneurial class—if it
is a class—changes too.
This
is probably
a gradual development, but one that is far advanced in most of the
highly industrialized societies today.
If we follow Bendix (138, p.
228) in distinguishing capitalists, heirs, and bureaucrats as three types
of entrepreneurs,
it
is evident that three significantly different pat-
terns of recruitment correspond to these types. The capitalist in this
sense
is a man who owns and manages an enterprise which he has
founded himself. From having been perhaps a skilled craftsman or
a shopkeeper at the beginning of his career, he has built up, "from
scratch," a sizable firm or factory and one that continues to grow in
scope, size, and production. The heir, by contrast,
is born into the
ownership of an enterprise, and apart from perhaps a few years' ex-
perience in some of
its departments he has known nothing but the
property he has inherited. Both the capitalist and the heir are owner-
managers.
^ They extend from direct pressure aimed
at forcing the manager to resign or
change his attitudes
to indirect means of disturbing the operation of the enterprise
which may result in the manager's being reprimanded or deposed by the
directors,
who, in this case, act in a sense on behalf of the employees.
* Bendix has impressively demonstrated that this change was accompanied bv a
change in "managerial ideologies,"
i.e., in attempts to justify theoretically the author-
ity of the entrepreneur
(cf. 138). He asserts an ideological change from basing un-
limited authority on the interests of a ruling class to presuming, on the part of modern
management, an identity of interests among
all participants of production.
Bendix's
argument lends considerable support
to my
thesis
that
the separation of ownership
and control involved a change in the basis of legitimacy of authority.

Changes Since Marx
For mere managers, however, there are two typical patterns of
recruitment, and both of them differ radically from those of capital-
ists and heirs. One of these patterns is the bureaucratic career.
In the
early joint-stock companies in particular, executives were often chosen
from among the firm's leading employees, both technical and clerical.
They had worked their way up from the ranks. More recently, a dif-
ferent pattern has gained increasing importance.
Today, a majority
of top management
officials in industrial enterprises have acquired
their positions on the strength of some specialized education, and of
university degrees.
Lawyers, economists, and engineers often enter
management almost immediately after they have completed their
education, andgradually rise to the top positions. There can be little
doubt that both these patterns of recruitment—but in particular the
latter—distinguish managerial groups significantly from those of old-
style owner-managers as well as new-style mere owners. Their social
background and experience place these groups into different fields of
reference, and it seems at least likely that the group of professionally
trained managers "increasingly develops
its own functionally deter-
mined character traits and modes of thought" (Sering, 74, p. 205).
For this is, in our context, the crucial effect of the separation of owner-
ship and control in industry:
that
it produces two sets of roles the
incumbents of which increasingly move apart in their outlook on and
attitudes toward society in general and toward the enterprise in par-
ticular. Their reference groups differ, and different reference groups
make for different values. Among classical capitalists, the "organiza-
tion man"
is an unthinkable absurdity.
Yet the manager
is "not
the individualist but the man who works through others for others"
(Whyte, 169, p. 21). Never has the imputation of a profit motive
been further from the real motives of men than
it
is for modern
bureaucratic managers,^
Economically, managers are interested
in
such things as rentability, efficiency, and productivity.
But all these
are indissolubly linked with the imponderables of what has been called
the social "climate of the enterprise" {Betriebsklima). The manager
shares with the capitalist two important social reference groups:
his
peers and his subordinates. But his attitude toward these differs con-
siderably from that of the capitalist (as does consequently, the atti-
® Which
is not to say that this "imputation" may not be useful as an assumption
in economic theory.
There
is no need
for
theoretical assumptions
to be altogether
realistic.
However,
it may be advisable even
for economists to try and extend their
models by including
in their assumptions some of the
social
factors characteristic of
entrepreneurial
roles.

47
tude expected from him by his peers)
. For him, to be successful means
to be liked, and to be liked means, in many ways, to be alike. The
manager is an involuntary ruler, and his attitudes betray his feelings.
Before concluding this analysis it would perhaps be well to point
out briefly what it does not mean or imply.
Despite many differences,
there are without doubt considerable similarities in the positions, roles,
and attitudes of both the capitalist and the manager.
Both are entre-
preneurial roles, and both are therefore subject to certain expectations
which no social context can remove.
Moreover, there are numerous
personal and social ties between owners and managers in all industrial
societies.
If anything, the unpropertied managers are more active in
political affairs, both as individuals and through their associations and
lobbies.
Also, while
the
joint-stock company
has conquered
the
sphere of industrial production (i.e., of secondary industries), it is still
of only minor importance in the tertiary industries of trade and com-
merce and in the services.
Thus, the separation of ownership and
control is not as fundamental a change as, say, the industrial revolu-
tion. But it is a change, and one with very definite, if restricted, im-
plications for class structure and conflict.
There is little reason to follow Marx and describe the condition
of separation of ownership and control as a transitional form of his^
torical development.
It
is no more transitional than any other stage
of history, and it has already proven quite a vital pattern of social and
economic structure. But I think that we can follow Marx in his radical
interpretation of this phenomenon. The separation of ownership and
control has replaced one group by two whose
positions,
roles, and
outlooks are far from identical.
In taking this view, one does of course
agree with Marx against himself.
For
it follows from this that the
homogeneous capitalist class predicted by Marx has in fact not devel-
oped. Capital—and thereby capitalism—has dissolved and given way,
in the economic sphere, to a plurality of partly agreed, partly com-
peting, and partly simply different groups. The effect of this develop-
ment on class conflict is threefold:
first, the replacement of capitalists
by managers involves a change in the composition of the groups par-
ticipating in conflict J second, and as a consequence of this change in
recruitment and composition, there
is a change in the nature of the
issues that cause conflicts, for the interests of the functionaries without
capital differ from those of full-blown capitalists, and so therefore
do the interests of labor vis-a-vis their new oppo'^dnts; and third,
the decomposition of capital involves a change in
tit-e patterns of con-
flict. One might question whether this new conflict, in which labor is

----- Page 66 (native) -----
48
Changes Since "Marx
no longer opposed to a homogeneous capitalist class, can still be de-
scribed as a class conflict at all.
In any case,
it
is different from the
division of the whole society into two great and homogeneous hostile
camps with which Marx was concerned. While I would follow the
radical view of the separation of ownership and control in industry
to this point, there is one thing to be said in favor of the conservative
view.
Changes in the composition of conflict groups, of the issues,
and of patterns of conflict do not imply the abolition of conflict or
even of the specific conflict between management and labor in industry.
Despite the effects of the decomposition of capital on class structure,
we have no reason to believe that antagonisms and clashes of interest
have now been banned from industrial enterprises.
SKILL AND STRATIFICATION, OR THE DECOMPOSITION OF LABOR
While Marx had at least a premonition of things to come with
respect to capital, he remained unaware of developments affecting the
unity and homogeneity of labor. Yet in this respect, too, the sphere of
production which loomed so large in Marx's analyses became the start-
ing point of changes that clearly refute his predictions. The working
class of today, far from being a homogeneous group of equally un-
skilled and impoverished people, is in fact a stratum differentiated by
numerous subtle and not-so-subtle distinctions. Here, too, history has
dissolved one position, or role, and has substituted for
it a plurality
of roles that are endowed with diverging and often conflicting ex-
pectations.
In trying to derive his prediction of the growing homogeneity of
labor from the assumption that the technical development of industry
would tend to abolish all differences of skill and qualification, Marx
was a genuine child of his century. Only the earliest political econo-
mists had believed that the division of labor in manufacturing would
make
for an "increase of dexterity
in every particular workman"
(Adam Smith,
1 85, p. 7) by allowing him to refine the "skill acquired
by frequent repetition of the same process" (Babbage, 172, p. 134).
Already in the following generation, social scientists were quite unani-
mous in believing that the processes of industrial production "effect
a substitution of labor comparatively unskilled, for that which is more
skilled" (Ure,
1 88, p. 30), and that the division of labor had reached
a phase "in which we have seen the skill of the worker decrease at the
rate at which industry becomes more perfect" (Proudhon,
181, p.
153).
Marx was only too glad to adopt this view which tallied so
well with his general theories of class structure: "The interests and
life situations of the proletariat are more and more equalized, since

----- Page 67 (native) -----
Changes Since Marx
49
the machinery increasingly obliterates the differences of labor and
depresses the wage almost everywhere to an equally low level" (14,
p.
17).
"The hierarchy of specialized workmen that characterizes
manufacture
is replaced, in the automatic factory, by a tendency to
equalize and reduce to one and the same level every kind of work that
has to be done" ( 1 2, 1, p. 490)
Indeed, so far as we can tell from available evidence, there was,
up to the end of the nineteenth century, a tendency for most industrial
workers to become unskilled, i.e., to be reduced to the same low level
of skill.
But since then, two new patterns have emerged which are
closely related on the one hand to technical innovations in production,
on the other hand to a new philosophy of industrial organization as
symbolized by the works of F. W. Taylor (167) and H. Fayol (145).
First, there emerged, around the turn of the century, a new category
of workers which today is usually described as semiskilled. As early
as 1905, Max Weber referred to the growing importance of "the
semiskilled workers trained directly on the job" (32, p. 502). By the
1930's, the theory had become almost commonplace that "there
is a
tendency for
all manual
laborers
to become
semiskilled machine
minders, and for highly skilled as well as unskilled workers to become
relatively less important" (Carr-Saunders and Jones, 89, p. 61). The
semiskilled differ from the unskilled not so much
in the technical
qualifications required from them for their work, as in certain less
easily defined extrafunctional skills which relate to their capacity to
accept responsibility, to adapt to difficult conditions, and to perform a
job intelligently.
These extrafunctional
skills are acquired not by
formal
training
(although many semiskilled workers
receive
this
also), but by experience on the jobj yet these "skills of responsibility"
constitute a clear line of demarcation between those who have them
and the unskilled who lack both training and experience. Apart from
the semiskilled, there appeared, more recently, a new and ever-grow-
ing demand for highly skilled workers of the engineer type in indus-
try. Carr-Saunders and Jones, in their statement above, still expected
the simultaneous reduction of unskilled as well as skilled labor. Today
we know—as Friedmann (146), Geiger
(46), Moore (157), and
others have pointed out—that the second half of this expectation has
not come true.
Increasingly complex machines require increasingly
qualified designers, builders, maintenance and repair men, and even
minders, so that Drucker extrapolates only slightly when he says:
"Within the working class a new shift from unskilled to skilled labor
has begun—reversing the trend of the last fifty years. The unskilled
worker is actually an engineering imperfection, as unskilled work, at

----- Page 68 (native) -----
50
Changes Since Marx
least in theory, can always be done better, faster and cheaper by ma-
chines" (144, pp. 42-43).
Because of changing classifications,
it is a little difficult to docu-
ment this development
statistically.
As for the unskilled, a slight
decrease in their proportion can be shown for England where, in
1 9 5 1
,
they amounted to 12.5 per cent of the occupied male population, as
against 16.5 per cent in
1 93 1
.
In the United States, an even sharper
decrease has been noted, from 36 per cent of the labor force in
1 9 10 to
just over 28 per cent in 1930 and, further, to less than 20 per cent in
1950 (see Caplow, 141, p. 299). But statistics are here neither very
reliable nor even indispensable evidence. Analysis of industrial condi-
tions suggests quite clearly that within the labor force of advanced
industry we have to distinguish at least three skill groups:
a growing
stratum of highly skilled workmen who increasingly merge with both
engineers and white-collar employees, a relatively stable stratum of
semiskilled workers with a high degree of diffuse as well as specific
industrial experience, and a dwindling stratum of totally unskilled
laborers who are characteristically either newcomers to industry (be-
ginners, former agricultural laborers, immigrants)
or semi-unem-
ployables.
It appears, furthermore, that these three groups differ not
only in their level of skill, but also in other attributes and determi-
nants of social status. The semiskilled almost invariably earn a higher
wage than the unskilled, whereas the skilled are often salaried and
thereby participate in white-collar status. The hierarchy of skill cor-
responds exactly to the hierarchy of responsibility and delegated au-
thority within the working class. From numerous studies
it would
seem beyond doubt that it also correlates with the hierarchy of pres-
tige, at the top of which we find the skilled man whose prolonged
training, salary, and security convey special status, and at the bottom
of which stands the unskilled man who
is, according to a recent Ger-
man investigation into workers' opinions, merely "working" without
having an "occupation" proper (see Kluth,
1 50, p. 67)
. Here as else-
where Marx was evidently mistaken.
"Everywhere,
the working
class differentiates itself more and more, on the one hand into occu-
pational groups, on the other hand into three large categories with
different,
if not contradictory, interests:
the skilled craftsmen, the
unskilled laborers, and the semiskilled specialist workers"
(Philip,
161, p. 2).^°
In trying to assess the consequences of this development, it is well

is based on two more elabo-
rate studies of mine, one of unskilled labor (143), and one of skill and social stratifi-
cation (142).

I must refer to these studies.

to remember that, for Marx, the increasing uniformity of the working
class was an indispensable condition of that intensification of the class
struggle which was to lead, eventually, to
its climax in a revolution.
The underlying argument of what for Marx became a prediction ap-
pears quite plausible. For there to be a revolution, the conflicts within
a society have to become extremely intense. For conflicts to be intense,
one would indeed expect its participants to be highly unified and ho-
mogeneous groups.
But neither capital nor labor have developed
along these lines.
Capital has dissolved into at least two, in many ways
distinct, elements, and so has labor. The proletarian, the impoverished
slave of industry who is indistinguishable from his peers in terms of
his work, his skill, his wage, and his prestige, has left the scene. What
is more,
it appears that by now he has been followed by his less de-
praved, but equally alienated successor, the worker.
In modern indus-
try, "the worker" has become precisely the kind of abstraction which
Marx quite justly resented so much.
In his place, we find a plurality
of status and skill groups whose interests often diverge. Demands
of the skilled for security may injure the semiskilled; wage claims
of the semiskilled may raise objections by the skilled; and any interest
on the part of the unskilled is bound to set their more highly skilled
fellow workmen worrying about diflFerentials.
Again, as in the case of capital, it does not follow from the decom-
position of labor that there
is no bond left that unites most workers
—at least for specific goals; nor does it follow that industrial conflict
has lost its edge. But here, too, a change of the issues and, above all,
of the patterns of conflict is indicated. As with the capitalist class,
it
has become doubtful whether speaking of the working class still makes
much sense.
Probably Marx would have agreed that class "is a force
that unites into groups people who differ from one another, by over-
riding the differences between them" (Marshall, 57, p. 114), but he
certainly did not expect the differences to be so great, and the uniting
force so precarious as it has turned out to be in the case both of capital
and of labor.
THE "new middle CLASs"
Along with the decomposition of both capital and labor a new
stratum emerged within, as well as outside, the industry of modern
societies, which was, so to speak, born decomposed.
Since Lederer and
Marschak first published their essay on this group, and coined for
it
the name "new middle class" {neuer Mittelstand) ^ so much has been
written by sociologists about the origin, development, position, and
function of white-collar or black-coated employees that whatever one

says is bound to be repetitive. However, only one conclusion is borne
out quite clearly by all these studies of salaried employees in industry,
trade, commerce, and public administration:
that there is no word in
any modern language to describe this group that is no group, class that
is no class, and stratum that is no stratum. To be sure, there have been
attempts to describe
it.
In
fact, we are here
in the comparatively
fortunate position of having to decide between two or, perhaps, three
conflicting theories. But none of these attempts has been free of in-
numerable qualifications to the effect that it is impossible to generalize.
Although the following brief discussion will not distinguish itself in
this respect, it could not be avoided in an account of social changes of
the past century that have a bearing on the problem of class.
By the time Marx died, about one out of every twenty members
of the labor force was in what might roughly be described a clerical
occupation j today, it is one out of every five and, in the tertiary indus-
tries, one out of every three. More accurate figures of size and growth
of the "new middle class" could be given,^^ but even these are sur-
prisingly precise in view of the fact that
it
is virtually impossible to
delimit the "group" which they count.
For, technically, the "occupa-
tional salad" (Mills) of salaried employees includes post-office clerks
as well as senior executives, shop supervisors as well as hospital doc-
tors, typists as well as prime ministers. Presumably, a "middle class"
is located somewhere between at least two other classes, one above
it
and one below it. Yet the "new middle class" has stubbornly resisted
all attempts to define its upper and lower limits.
In fact,
it is obvious
that the questions where salaried employees begin to be members of
an upper stratum or ruling class and where they "really" still belong
in the working class cannot in general be answered.
Our questions
will have to be rather more specific.
If one is, as we are, concerned not with patterns of social stratifi-
cation but with lines of conflict, then one thing is certain
: however we
may choose to delimit the aggregate of salaried employees, they are
not a "middle class," because from the point of view of a theory of
conflict there can be no such entity as a middle class.
Evident as it is,
this statement is bound to be misunderstood—but, then, much of this
study is an attempt to elucidate
it.
It is true that in terms of prestige
and income many salaried employees occupy a position somewhere

between the very wealthy and the very poor, somewhere in the middle
of the
scale of
social
stratification.
But
in
a situation of
conflict,
whether defined in a Marxian way or in some other way, this kind of
intermediate position just does not exist, or, at least, exists only as a
negative position of nonparticipation. This point might be illuminated
by a slightly misleading example: an election in which there is a choice
between two parties j while
it
is possible to abstain, only those who
make up their minds one way or the other participate actively in the
contest.
Similarly, our problem here is to determine in which way the
so-called new middle class has made up its mind or is likely to make
up
its mind. And the answer we shall give corresponds—to remain
within the metaphor for a moment—to the findings of Bonham in
England (127) and Von der Heydte in Germany (196), according
to which two-thirds of the "new middle class" tend to vote for con-
servative, and one-third for radical parties.
I have claimed above that there are two or, perhaps, three com-
peting theories about the position of the "new middle class." From
the point of view of our problem, these are soon reduced to what at
best amounts to two-and-a-half theories. For the third theory I had
in mind is in fact little more than a description, and an inconclusive
one at that.
It is embodied in Crozier's "working hypothesis" of an
empirical investigation conducted in France: "The situation of the
salaried employee is one that makes possible an identification with the
world of the ruling class and promises considerable rewards
if this
succeeds. But at the same time it is a working-class situation and there-
fore suffers from most of those limitations to which all other workers
are subjected—limited income
as well as lack of autonomy and a
position of subordination" ( 1 30, pp. 3 1 i-i 2)
. Statements of this kind
are as frequent as they are useless for purposes of conflict analysis.
We can therefore dismiss at the outset any theory that confines itself
to statements with clauses like "partly this
.
.
.
partly that" or "on
the one hand this ...
on the other hand that."
There are two theories which do not suffer from this indecision,
and they are directly contradictory.
According to the
first of these,
the "new middle class" constitutes in fact an extension of the old, capi-
talist or bourgeois, ruling class, and
is in this sense part of the ruling
class.
Croner—who, apart from Renner (71), Bendix (138, chap,
iv), and others, recently espoused this theory—argues that "the expla-
nation of the special social position of salaried employees can be found
in the fact that their work tasks have once been entrepreneurial tasks"
(129, p.
T^G).
This statement is meant by Croner both in a historical

and in a structural sense.
Historically, most clerical occupations were
differentiated out of the leading positions in industry, commerce, and
the state.
Structurally they are, according to this view, characterized
by the exercise of delegated authority—delegated, that
is, from the
real seat of authority in social organizations, from, in other words,
their leading positions.
In contrast to this view, Geiger, C. Wright
Mills, and others claim that the "new middle class" is, if not exactly
an extension of the proletariat, at any rate closer to the working class
than to the ruling class, whether capitalist or managerial.
"Objec-
tively,
.
.
. the structural position of the white-collar mass is becom-
ing more and more similar to that of the wage-workers. Both are, of
course, propertyless, and their incomes draw closer and closer
to-
gether.
All the factors of their status position, which have enabled
white-collar workers to set themselves apart from wage-workers, are
now subject to definite decline" (137, p. 297).
Mills does not say so,
but he would probably have no quarrel with Geiger's conclusion that
"from the point of view of class structure in Marx's sense the salaried
employee is undoubtedly closer to the worker than to any other figure
of modern society" (46, p. 167).
The two views are clearly in conflict, and it seems desirable to come
to a decision as to their relative merits.^"
Fortunate as
it
is, from a
methodological point of view, to have to decide between two conflict-
ing theories, our situation here does not, upon closer inspection, turn
out to be quite so simple.
In fact. Mills may well be right when he
suspects that because of the vastly different "definitions" of the "new
middle class" the two theories not only may peacefully co-exist but
even both be correct (137, pp. 291
ff.).
Clearly the theory that sal-
aried employees have delegated authority and are therefore part of
the ruling class cannot have meant the office boy, the salesgirl, or even
the skilled worker who has been granted the status symbol of a salary;
equally clearly, the theory that salaried employees resemble the work-
ing class does not apply to senior executives, higher civil servants, and
^^ C. Wright Mills, in his very balanced account of views about the "new middle
class" (137, chap. 13), enumerates four competing theories (pp. 290 ff.). To the two
mentioned he adds the theories that (l)
the middle class
is destined to be the ruling
class of the future, and (2)
the growth of the "new middle class" operates as a force
to stabilize the old, and eventually to abolish
all class conflicts. The latter view will
be discussed at a later stage, since
it presupposes some consideration of the significance
of social conflict in general.
As to the former view,
it simply betrays an unpardonable
confusion of terms on the part of the authors Mills refers to.
It seems obvious that so
long as the middle class
is a middle class there must be a class above
it, and once
it
is
the ruling class
it
is no longer the middle class.

SS
professional people. However, there is more than a question of defi-
nition involved in this difficulty.
Instead of asking which of two apparently conflicting theories ap-
plies to the "new middle class," we can, so to speak, reverse our ques-
tion and ask whether there is any criterion that would allow us to dis-
tinguish between those sectors of the "new middle class" to which one
theory applies and those to which the other theory applies.
I think
that there is such a criterion, and that its application provides at least a
preliminary solution to our wider problem of the effects of the growth
of a "new middle class" on class structure and class conflict.
It seems
to me that a fairly clear as well as significant line can be drawn between
salaried employees who occupy positions that are part of a bureau-
cratic hierarchy and salaried employees in positions that are not. The
occupations of the post-office clerk, the accountant, and, of course,
the senior executive are rungs on a ladder of bureaucratic positions;
those of the salesgirl and the craftsman are not. There may be barriers
in bureaucratic hierarchies which are insurmountable for people who
started in low positions; salaried employees outside such hierarchies
may earn more than those within, and they may also change occupa-
tions and enter upon a bureaucratic career; but these and similar facts
are irrelevant to the distinction between bureaucrats and white-collar
workers proposed here.
Despite these facts I suggest that the ruling-
class theory applies without exception to the social position of bureau-
crats, and the working-class theory equally generally to the social posi-
tion of white-collar workers.
There
is, in other words, one section of the "new middle class"
the condition of which, from the point of view of class conflict, closely
resembles that of industrial workers.
This section includes many of
the salaried employees in the tertiary industries, in shops and restau-
rants, in cinemas, and in commercial firms, as well
as those highly
skilled workers and foremen who have acquired salaried status.
It
is
hard to estimate, from available evidence, the numerical size of this
group, but
it probably does not at present exceed one-third of the
whole "new middle class"—although it may do so in the future, since
the introduction of office machinery tends to reduce the number of
bureaucrats while increasing the demand for salaried
office techni-
cians.^^ Although some white-collar workers earn rather more than
^^ It
is
still too early to make any definite statements about this important devel-
opment, which Bahrdt described as the "industrialization of bureaucracy"
(cf.
124)
;
but the automation of office work
is sure to have consequences for the class structure of
contemporary societies.

industrial workers, and most of them enjoy a somewhat higher pres-
tige, their class situation appears sufficiently similar to that of workers
to expect them to act alike.
In general, it is among white-collar work-
ers that one would expect trade unions as well as radical political par-
ties to be successful.
The bureaucrats, on the other hand, share, if often in a minor way,
the requisites of a ruling class. Although many of them earn less than
white-collar and even industrial workers, they participate in the exer-
cise of authority and thereby occupy a position vis-a-vis rather than
inside the working class. The otherwise surprising fact that many
salaried employees identify themselves with the interests, attitudes,
and styles of life of the higher-ups can be accounted for in these terms.
For the bureaucrats, the supreme social reality is their career that pro-
vides, at least in theory, a direct link between every one of them and
the top positions which may be described as the ultimate seat of au-
thority.
It would be false to say that the bureaucrats are a ruling class,
but in any case they are part of
it, and one would therefore expect
them to act accordingly in industrial, social, and political conflicts."
The decomposition of labor and capital has been the result of social
developments that have occurred since Marx, but the "new middle
class" was born decomposed.
It neither has been nor is it ever likely
to be a class in any sense of this term.
But while there
is no "new
middle class," there are, of course, white-collar workers and bureau-
crats, and the growth of these groups
is one of the striking features
of historical development in the past century. What is their effect on
class structure and class conflict, if it is not that of adding a new class
to the older ones Marx described?
It follows from our analysis that
the emergence of salaried employees means in the first place an exten-
sion of the older classes of bourgeoisie and proletariat. The bureau-
crats add to the bourgeoisie, as the white-collar workers add to the
proletariat. Both classes have become, by these extensions, even more
complex and heterogeneous than their decomposition has made them
in any case. By gaining new elements, their unity has become a highly
doubtful and precarious feature.
White-collar workers, like indus-
trial workers, have neither property nor authority, yet they display
many social characteristics that are quite unlike those of the old work-
^* Evidently, rather more will have to be said to make a convincing case for what
I have sketched very briefly and somewhat dogmatically at this point.
In so far as the
structural position of bureaucrats has a bearing on the problem of class conflict in the
present and future, these remarks will
in
fact be extended and supplemented below
in Chapter VIII.

57
ing class.
Similarly, bureaucrats differ from the older ruling class
despite their share in the exercise of authority. Even more than the
decomposition of capital and labor, these facts make it highly doubtful
whether the concept of class is
still applicable to the conflict groups
of post-capitalist societies.
In any case, the participants,
issues, and
patterns of
conflict have changed, and the
pleasing
simplicity of
Marx's view of society has become a nonsensical construction.
If ever
there have been two large, homogeneous, polarized, and identically
situated social classes, these have certainly ceased to exist today, so
that an unmodified Marxian theory is bound to fail in explaining the
structure and conflicts of advanced industrial societies.
SOCIAL MOBILITY
The decomposition of capital and labor as well as their extension
by sections of the "new middle class" are phenomena which have an
obvious and direct bearing on class structure. But they are neither the
only changes that have occurred since Marx nor, perhaps, the most
significant ones from the point of view of class. Apart from such po-
litical and economic forces as totalitarianism and socialism,
it was in
particular the institutionalization of the two great social forces of mo-
bility and equality that has steered class structures and conflicts in
directions unforeseen by Marx. Marx was not, in fact, unaware of the
importance of these forces.
In explaining the absence of stable classes
in the United States in terms of what he called the "exchange between
classes" (cf. 8, p. 18), he anticipated the cardinal thesis of Sombart's
brilliant essay. Why is there no Socialism in the United States? (204)
But for Marx, mobility was a symptom of short-lived transitional
periods of history,
i.e., of either the emergence or the impending
breakdown of a society.
Today, we would tend to take the opposite
view.
Social mobility has become one of the crucial elements of the
structure of industrial societies, and one would be tempted to predict
its "breakdown" if the process of mobility were ever seriously im-
peded. Marx believed that the strength of a ruling class documents
itself in its ability to absorb the ablest elements of other classes.
In
a manner of speaking, this is permanently the case in advanced indus-
trial societies, yet we should hesitate to infer from a steady increase
in the upward mobility of the talented that the present ruling class
is particularly strong or homogeneous.
Social mobility reprcsenco one of the most studied and, at the same
time, least understood areas of sociological inquiry. Today, we know
a great deal about social mobility in various countries, and yet we do

not really know what we know. Not only do we not have any satis-
factory answer to the question about the causes and consequences of
social mobility that was recently put by Lipset and Zetterberg
( 1 1 6,
p. 158), but we cannot even be sure about the so-called facts of the
case. The evidence we have is most conclusive with respect to mobility
between generations, although even here generalizations rest on extra-
polation as much as on interpretation.
It appears that in countries like
the United States, Great Britain, and Germany the rate of intergen-
eration mobility is generally fairly high. Only in the highest and, in
some countries, in the lowest ranges of the occupational scale do we
still find a considerable amount of self-recruitment.
Moreover, the
rate of mobility seems to correspond roughly to the degree of indus-
trialization in a country.
It is higher in Britain than in France, higher
in the United States than in Italy. This correlation between industrial
development and social mobility seems to hold also in the historical
dimension.
For Britain and Germany, investigations suggest a con-
siderable increase in mobility rates over the last three generations.^^
However, even if these generalizations are taken as suggestions
rather than conclusions, they have a high degree of verisimilitude.
For with respect to intergeneration mobility we have at our disposal
another kind of evidence which, although not quantitative,
is quite
conclusive. When Marx wrote his books, he assumed that the position
an individual occupies in society is determined by his family origin and
the position of his parents. The sons of workers have no other choice
but to become workers themselves, and the sons of capitalists stay in
^^ The first of these generalizations
is really little more than a guess based on the
interpretation of mobility studies by Glass and others in Britain (107), Bolte in Ger-
many (102, 103), Rogoff in the United States (121), the Japan Sociological Society
(115), and the data included
in the article by Lipset and Zetterberg (116).
Some
comparative data have been brought together in this article also, as well as in the volume
edited by Glass (ill, p. 263).
Historical studies of mobility suffer from the fact that
they have to rely on people's memories; some tentative findings have been presented
by Mukherjee (119, p. 284) and Bolte (104,
p.
186).
Despite my qualifications,
this evidence
is not, after
all, unimpressive.
However,
all the studies mentioned do
not really stand up to a thorough methodological inspection.
This
is almost obvious
in comparative analyses based on vastly different occupational classifications which no-
body so
far has taicen the trouble
to
reclassify.
But
it
is also true
for studies in one
country. They have usually employed the index of association for measuring mobility
rates, and,
as Professor John W. Tukey has pointed out to me,
this index
is neither
formally sound nor empirically useful.
Formally, the index of association would have
to be weighted by the size of status categories to be of any use at
all.
Empirically,
it
fails to describe the most important aspect of social mobility:
the existence of barriers
between
strata.
These and other objections
to
existing studies make great caution
imperative in the use of their findings.

the class of their fathers. At the time, this assumption was probably
not far from the truth. But since then a new pattern of role allocation
has become institutionalized in industrial societies. Today, the alloca-
tion of social positions is increasingly the task of the educational sys-
tem. Even a hundred years ago, "the attendance of a certain type of
school meant a confirmation of a certain social status or rank, and not
its acquisition" (Schelsky, I22, p. 3). Today, the school has become
the "first and thereby decisive point of social placement with respect
to future social security, social rank and the extent of future consump-
tion chances" (122, p. 6).
In post-capitalist society, it is "the process
of socialization itself, especially as found in the educational system,
that is serving as the proving ground for ability and hence the selective
agency for placing people in different statuses according to their ca-
pacities" (Davis, 208, p. 219). To be sure, there still are numerous
obstacles and barriers in the way of complete equality of educational
opportunity, but it is the stubborn tendency of modern societies to in-
stitutionalize intergeneration mobility by making a person's social po-
sition dependent on his educational achievement. Where this
is the
case, no social stratum, group, or class can remain completely stable for
more than one generation.
Social mobility, which, for Marx, was the
exception that confirmed the rule of class closure,
is built into the
structure of post-capitalist society and has therefore become a factor
to be reckoned with in all analyses of conflict and change.
There are forms of mobility other than that between generations,
but about these we know even less. Thomas' study of intrageneration
mobility in Britain (123) suggests a truly extraordinary degree of
exchange between occupational groups. According to this study, there
is not in contemporary Britain a single status category the majority of
the members of which have never been in higher or lower strata (123,
p. 30)
. But while it seems probable that there is a considerable amount
of movement between occupations in various spheres of work, find-
ings like those of Thomas's would require a more thorough analysis
than the data published so far permit.
There are sure to be even
higher barriers for intrageneration mobility than for mobility between
generations, so that all we can infer from what patchy data we have
is what anybody living in a modern society can observe for himself:
in post-capitalist societies there is a great deal of movement, upwards
and downwards as well as on one social level, between generations as
well as within them, so that the individual who stays at his place of
birth and in the occupation of his father throughout his life has be-
come a rare exception.
When Marx dealt with the "exchange between classes"
in the

----- Page 78 (native) -----
6o
Changes Since Marx
United States, he assumed that a high degree of exchange would be
detrimental to the formation of powerful classes and therefore incon-
ducive
to the fomentation of violent
conflicts.
This assumption
is
plausible. A class composed of individuals whose social position is not
an inherited and inescapable fate, but merely one of a plurality of so-
cial roles, is not likely to be as powerful a historical force as the closed
class Marx had in mind. Where mobility within and between genera-
tions
is a regular occurrence, and therefore a legitimate expectation
of many people, conflict groups are not likely to have either the per-
manence or the dead seriousness of caste-like classes composed of
hopelessly alienated men. And as the instability of classes grows, the
intensity of class conflict is bound to diminish.
Instead of advancing
their claims as members of homogeneous groups, people are more
likely to compete with each other as individuals for a place in the sun.
Where such competition is not possible, or not successful, group con-
flicts assume a somewhat milder and looser character than class strug-
gles of a Marxian type.
Again, the question arises whether such con-
flict groups of mobile individuals can still be described as classes.
In
any case, the institutionalization of social mobility through both the
educational and the occupational systems contradicts quite clearly the
prediction of a continuous increase in the intensity of class conflicts.
In a study of the effects of social mobility on group relations,
Janowitz arrived at two interesting conclusions: "One, social mobility
generally has been found to have disruptive implications for the struc-
ture of primary group relations and on related social psychological
states, and thereby to carry socially maladjustive consequences.
.
.
.
Second [with respect to the consequences of social mobility for second-
ary group structures], markedly diflFerent order of inferences can be
made. Upward social mobility, especially in the middle class, tends
to orient and incorporate mobile groups into many types of secondary
structures with relative eff^ectiveness. On the other hand,
.
.
. down-
ward mobility does not produce effective involvement in secondary
group structures in pursuit of self-interest" ( i I4,p. 193). This find-
ing (which evidently applies to intergeneration mobility only)
is a
welcome reminder of the fact that although mobility diminishes the
coherence of groups as well as the intensity of class conflict,
it does
not eliminate either. While civil wars and revolutions may be unlikely
in a highly mobile society, there
is no a priori reason to believe that
conflicts of
interests will
not
find
their expression
in other ways.
Marx's theory of class fails to account for such other types of conflict,
and
it will be our task in this study to find an approach that accounts

6 1
for group conflicts in mobile as well as in relatively immobile indus-
trial societies.
EQUALITY IN THEORY AND PRACTICE
In the preceding sections two of the three predictions that Marx
made about the future development of classes
in
capitalist
society-
have been discussed in the light of the social history of the last decades.
We have seen that neither of them has come true. Contrary to Marx's
expectations, the increasing differentiation as well as homogeneity of
classes was checked by the decomposition of labor and capital, the
emergence of white-collar workers and bureaucrats, and the institu-
tionalization of social mobility. But none of Marx's hopes—for such
they were—has been refuted more dramatically in social development
than his prediction that the class situations of bourgeoisie and pro-
letariat would tend toward extremes of wealth and poverty, posses-
sion and deprivation.
Here,
too, Marx had a simple theory. He
believed in a direct and unfailing correlation between the extremity
of class situations and the intensity of class conflict.
It
is quite pos-
sible that this theory contains an element of truth, but
if
it does,
then the remarkable spread of
social
equality
in the
past century
has rendered class struggles and revolutionary changes utterly im-
possible.
T. H. Marshall has shown that much of modern social history
can be understood in terms of what he calls the "war" between "citi-
zenship rights" (which, by definition, are equal rights) and the "capi-
talist class system"
(cf. 57).
In successive periods, three types of
citizenship rights have been adopted by most industrial societies, and
they have increasingly affected the processes of class differentiation
and class conflict. The first of these rights, that of the generalization
of legal equality, was still quite compatible with class conflict and even
with class war. Indeed, Marx used his most mocking and cynical style
when he referred to legal equality in capitalist society:
"Liberty!
For buyers and sellers of a commodity, e.g., labor power, are deter-
mined by their free will alone.
They enter into contracts as free,
legally equal persons.
.
.
. Equality!
For they are related merely
as owners of commodities, and exchange equivalent for equivalent.
Property!
For everybody controls merely what
is his"
(12,
I,
p.
1 84). But Marx overlooked what Tocqueville (whose work he prob-
ably knew) had observed before him, namely, that equality is a highly
dynamic force, and that men, once they are equal in some respects,
"must come in the end to be equal upon all" (232, p. $$)-

----- Page 80 (native) -----
62
Changes Since Marx
A considerable step towards complete equality was taken when
citizenship rights were,
in the nineteenth century, extended to the
political sphere.
Universal suffrage and the right to form political
parties and associations involved the removal
of
political
conflicts
from the factory floor and the street to negotiating bodies and parlia-
ments. On a different level,
it opened up the possibility for Marx's
followers to convert their master's theories into political realities
but
it is as well that they did not fail as miserably in this process as
Marx did himself. By virtue of freedom of association and political
equality, the early trade-union movement as well as socialist parties
grown out of it achieved considerable success in improving the lot of
the working class, although this progress was still restricted by many
an obstacle.
"Civil rights gave legal powers whose use was drastically
curtailed by class prejudice and lack of economic opportunity.
Politi-
cal rights gave potential power whose exercise demanded experience,
organization, and a change of ideas as to the proper functions of gov-
ernment" (57, p. 46).
Only when, in our own century, legal and
political citizenship rights were supplemented by certain social rights,
did the process of equalization of status really reach a point where the
differences and antagonisms of class are affected.
The social rights of citizenship which are widely recognized in
contemporary societies include old-age pensions, unemployment bene-
fits, public health insurance, and legal aid, as well as a minimum wage
and, indeed, a minimum standard of living.
"Equal participation in
the material and intellectual comforts of civilization ...
is the un-
disputed basic material right of our
social constitution"
(Schelsky,
122, p. 5). Where established rights guarantee this kind of equality
for every citizen, conflicts and differences of class are, at the very least,
no longer based on inequalities of status in a strict sense of this term.
From the point of view of legal privileges and deprivations, every
citizen of advanced industrial societies has an equal status, and what
social differences there arc arise on the undisputed basis of this funda-
mental equality. The "absolute" privilege of the bourgeoisie, and the
equally "absolute" alienation of the proletariat which Marx with a
characteristic Hegelian figure of thought predicted, has not only not
come true, but, by institutionalizing certain citizenship rights, post-
capitalist society has developed a type of social structure that excludes
both "absolute" and many milder forms of privilege and deprivation.
If equality before the law was for most people in the early phases of
capitalist society but a cynical fiction, the extended citizenship rights

----- Page 81 (native) -----
Changes Since Marx
63
of post-capitalist society represent a reality that forcefully counteracts
all remaining forms of social inequality and differentiation.
This is a fortiori the case, since along with the spread of citizen-
ship rights, the social situation of people became increasingly similar.
The completeness of this leveling tendency can be, and has been, exag-
gerated.
There are of course even today considerable differences in
income, prestige, spending habits, and styles of life.
But as a tend-
ency the process of leveling social differences cannot be denied. By
the simultaneous rise of the real wages of workers and the taxation
of top earnings, a redistribution of incomes has taken place—a redis-
tribution that some believe today has gone so far as to remove every
incentive for work requiring special training or skill. Many of the
technical comforts and status symbols of modern
life are increas-
ingly available to everybody. The mass-produced commodities of the
"culture industry" (Horkheimer and Adorno, 227) unite distant peo-
ple and areas in nearly identical leisure-time activities.
Schelsky gives
voice to the impression of many when he summarizes this develop-
ment as a process of "social leveling with predominantly petty-bour-
geois or middle-class patterns of behavior and ideals" (231, p. 349).^"
Social stratification and class structure are two distinct aspects of
social organization, but they both refer to inequalities in the social life
of individuals.
If, therefore, the legal and social status of people
undergoes a process of leveling which apparently tends towards com-
plete equality of status, the concepts of social stratification and class
structure tend to lose their meaning.
In so far as social stratification
is concerned, there is evidence and argument to contest this inference.
For one thing there is some doubt as to whether one can really extra-
polate from developments of the past century and infer a further
leveling of socioeconomic status. For another thing, it seems far more
likely from the point of view of a functioning social structure that
there is a certain minimum of inequalities which wilJ not be touched
by egalitarian trends under any condition. ^^
With respect
to
class
structure, the answer is not as simple. There can be little doubt that
^* There
is a host of literature on problems of equality and
social
class.

III, below),

^'^ The argument of Davis and Moore (90)
to this effect
is not, in my opinion,
wholly convincing, but many of the considerations relevant to the problem of the func-
tion of inequality have come out in their argument and the controversy following
it.

the equalization of status resulting from social developments of the
past century has contributed greatly to changing the issues and dimin-
ishing the intensity of class conflict. By way of extrapolation—fairly
wild extrapolation, I may say—some authors have visualized a state
in which there are no classes and no class conflicts, because there
is
simply nothing to quarrel about.
I do not think that such a state
is
ever likely to occur.
But in order to substantiate this opinion,
it
is
necessary to explore the structural limits of equality, i.e., to find the
points at which even the most fanatic egalitarian comes up against
insurmountable realities of social structure. One of these
is surely
the variety of human desires, ideas, and interests, the elimination of
which is neither desirable nor likely.
But while this
is important,
it
is not as such an element of social structure.
I shall suggest in this
study that the fundamental inequality of social structure, and the
lasting determinant of social conflict,
is the inequality of power and
authority which inevitably accompanies social organization.
But this
is an anticipation about which much more will have to be said.
In so
far as the theory and practice of equality in post-capitalist societies
are concerned, it seems certain that they have changed the issues and
patterns of class conflict, and possible that they have rendered the
concept of class inapplicable, but they have not removed all significant
inequalities, and they have not, therefore, eliminated the causes of
social conflict.
THE INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF CLASS CONFLICT
A historian might argue that all the tendencies of change here
described as changes in the structure of industrial societies since Marx
had in fact begun before and in some cases long before Marx died in
1883.
Joint-stock companies existed even before the industrial revo-
lution j there have always been workers of varying degrees of skill j
bureaucrats and white-collar workers are not an invention of capital-
ism, nor is social mobility 5 and the spread of social equality began at
least with the French Revolution, if not earlier. The historian
is of
course right, but so is, strangely enough, the sociologist (and while the
latter usually admits the former, the historian is rather less likely to
admit the latter). The sociologist is generally interested not so much
in the origin of social phenomena as in their spread and rise to wider
significance.
There
is. however, one line of social development
in
industrial societies which has both originated and spread since about
the time of Marx's death, and which is directly relevant to our prob-
lem. Geiger, who has described this change as the "institutionalization

of class conflict," says:
"The tension between
capital and labor
is
recognized as a principle of the structure of the labor market and has
become a legal institution of society.
.
.
. The methods, weapons,
and techniques of the class struggle are recognized—and are thereby
brought under control.
The struggle evolves according to
certain
rules of the game. Thereby the class struggle has lost its worst sting,
it is converted into a legitimate tension between power factors which
balance each other.
Capital and labor struggle with each other, con-
clude compromises, negotiate solutions, and thereby determine wage
levels, hours of work, and other conditions of work" (46, p.
1 84).
Marx displayed a certain sociological naivete when he expressed
his belief that capitalist society would be entirely unable to cope with
the class conflict generated by
its structure.
In fact, every society
is
capable of coping with whatever new phenomena arise in
it, if only
by the simple yet effective inertia which can be described, a little pre-
tentiously, as the process of institutionalization.
In the case of class
conflict, institutionalization assumed a number of successive and com-
plementary forms.
It began with the painful process of recognition
of the contending parties as legitimate interest groups. Within indus-
try, a "secondary system of industrial citizenship"
(Marshall,
57,
p. 68) enabled both workers and entrepreneurs to associate and defend
their interests collectively.
Outside industry, the primary system of
political citizenship had the same effect. And while, in the stage of
organization, conflict may develop a greater visible intensity, organi-
zation has at least two side effects which operate in the opposite direc-
tion.
Organization presupposes the legitimacy of conflict groups, and
it thereby removes the permanent and incalculable threat of guerrilla
warfare. At the same time, it makes systematic regulation of conflicts
possible.
Organization
is institutionalization, and whereas
its mani-
fest function
is usually an increasingly articulate and outspoken de-
fense of interests, it invariably has the latent function also of inaugu-
rating routines of conflict which contribute to reducing the violence
of clashes of interest.
These are generalizations derived from the experience of class
conflict in capitalist and post-capitalist
societies.
Here, the organi-
zation of capital and labor, bourgeoisie and proletariat, was soon fol-
lowed by several further patterns of conflict regulation. On the one
hand, the contending parties in industry and politics agreed on certain
rules of the game and created institutions which provided a frame-
work for the routinization of the process of conflict.
In industry, these
include collective-bargaining bodies of many kinds as well as systems

----- Page 84 (native) -----
66
Changes Since Marx
of
conciliation, mediation, and
arbitration.
In
politics,
legislative
bodies and courts of law serve similar functions/^
All these forms
help to convert strikes and civil wars from an exclusive weapon of
conflict to an ultima ratio of the contending parties.
Such forms of conflict regulation proper have been supplemented,
in most industrial societies, by changes in the structure of the industrial
enterprise and of the state which aim at reducing the intensity of con-
flict.
The establishment of shop stewards and factory committees,
and the participation of workers in industrial management, as well
as certain rules and customs relating to the rights of opposition par-
ties," are changes of this kind. There is an element of ideological mis-
conception in many of these institutions.
That
is, though these new
institutions may be designed to eliminate conflict, they may, indeed,
actually increase the violence of conflict by redirecting it.
In any case,
these structural changes in those
social organizations that generate
conflict show the acceptance by society of conflicting interests, with
which society has attempted to cope by institutionalizing them.
The institutionalization of class conflict implies its continued exist-
ence.
But institutionalized class conflict is nevertheless far removed
from the ruthless and absolute class struggle visualized by Marx.
It
is quite probable that most contemporary
industrial
societies have
ceased to be capitalist societies.
If this is true, it has happened not be-
cause they were unable to cope with the contradictions and conflicts
generated by the structure of capitalist society, but, more likely, pre-
cisely because they were able to cope with their conflicts.
Like many
of his contemporaries—if with rather different evaluative accents^-
Marx was so struck by the dynamics of early industrial conflict that he
believed its satisfactory settlement utterly impossible except by a revo-
lution.
However, also like many of his contemporaries, Marx was
mistaken.
Some feared and others wanted the revolution, but both
fear and hope were equally unfounded. Nobody can, of course, ever

social conflict will be given below, in Chapter VI.
^^ By contrast to changes in the structure of the enterprise, those in political insti-
tutions are very varied in different countries. They include, however, the participa-
tion of opposition members in decision-making bodies, especially in matters of defense,
the rights of higher civil servants to be retained even
if they are not in the majority
party, the custom to appoint a member of the opposition as speaker of parliament, and
the like.

be sure that a given pattern of conflict regulation will always prove
successful. There are still strikes, and for all we know they will con-
tinue to occur. But it has proved possible for industrial society to get
along with the clashes of interest arising from its industrial and politi-
cal structure—and
it has proved possible for interest groups to get
along with industrial society.
Instead of a battlefield, the scene of
group conflict has become a kind of market in which relatively autono-
mous forces contend according to certain rules of the game, by virtue
of which nobody is a permanent winner or loser. This course of devel-
opment must naturally be bitter for the orthodox and the dogmatic,
but theirs is the kind of bitterness which makes liberal minds rejoice.
CAPITALISM cum INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY
Not every industrial society is a capitalist society, and one of the
differences between the time of Marx and ours might be described
as the supersedence of capitalism.
But while there are a number of
significant differences between industrial societies of a hundred years
ago and today, there are also similarities. Some of these are obvious.
There are machines and factories, workers and entrepreneurs, wages
and profits today as there were a hundred years ago. The historical
traditions of the countries with which we are here concerned have
been added to, but not changed. Many of the specific cultural and
social features of capitalist societies in Europe and North America
have survived the changes of the last century almost untouched. How-
ever, we are not concerned here with a general and comprehensive
account of industrial
societies and their development.
Within the
more limited scope of the present study, the culture and history of
societies is but a background before which specific structures and con-
flicts unfold, and in turning to those elements of social structure that
remained unchanged in the past century we shall again confine our
discussion to aspects relevant to the problem of class.
Every society has a structure of institutions, groups, and roles.
But every society is also, as Durkheim put
it, a "moral society," that
is, it entails a set of norms and values which live both in the minds of
its citizens and in the patterns of their social relations. One of the para-
doxes of the social history of industrial societies
is that the structure
of their institutions has in the past century changed in many respects,
while their values have merely advanced, but not changed.
This
is
but a seeming contradiction, because one can show that most of the
changes discussed in this chapter occurred within a framework which

----- Page 86 (native) -----
68
Changes Since Marx
remained intact, and that the values of rationality, achievement, and
equality belong to this framework rather than to its changing details.
Thus, "economic rationalism," the value of purposeful economic
activity oriented toward the maximization of gains, has never left
industrial societies. As Max Weber has shown, this value preceded
capitalism and, indeed, constitutes one of the factors which account
for the emergence of capitalism. But its dynamics were not exhausted
once capitalism was under way.
Within capitalism, the impulse
to
organize economic activity more "rationally" remained a stubborn
tendency. When, towards the end of the nineteenth century, many
countries experienced what has sometimes been called a "second in-
dustrial revolution," the value of rationality stood behind it:
at about
this time, the "extensive" increase of industrial production was re-
placed by an "intensive" increase, i.e., by a "more rational" organiza-
tion of existing resources.
"Scientific management" and even "social
engineering" were part of this trend.
It was in the course of this de-
velopment that ever larger concentrations of production enterprises
proved imperative—enterprises so large that few individuals could
provide the capital to establish them, so that some new form of owner-
ship became desirable.
At the same time, the usefulness of human
skills
in terms of the maximization of gains was rediscovered.
It
proved more "rational" to carry on production with experienced and
well-trained workers than with mere "hands."
Finally, rationality
and bureaucracy are never very far apart;
in one sense the rapidly
growing demand for clerks and
office employees, accountants and
supervisors, statisticians and submanagers is but a concomitant of the
"rational" organization of enterprises. Thus, the changes that led to
the supersedence of capitalist society were the reflection of values on
which this type of social and economic organization was based.
Eco-
nomic "rationalism" seems a value characteristic of all industrial so-
cieties, not merely of their capitalist variant.^"
Essentially the same holds for the value of achievement, i.e., the
central place accorded to individual capacity,
effort, and success in
industrial societies. As with gains and profits, the content of success
may change in the course of history, but achievement has remained,
'°
I do not think that the replacement of the "protestant ethic" by a "social ethic"
(Whyte)
contradicts
this argument.
If by "rationalism" we understand purposeful
activity oriented to maximizing gains,
it remains open whether these gains are entirely
monetary in nature, or whether they include certain less tangible gains well compatible
with a "social ethic." The opposite of "rationalism"
is "traditionalism," and
I
see
no evidence for a return of the latter.

----- Page 87 (native) -----

69
so far, the cardinal social virtue of the citizens of industrial societies.
If anything, the recognition of achievement has progressed
in the
past century.
Ever since the industrial revolution, ascriptive criteria
of status have proved an obstacle to the systematic exploitation of re-
sources, material and human. An industrial enterprise cannot afford
to rely on the social origin of its members in the sphere either of man-
agement or of labor j to carry on its tasks it needs above all capable,
well-trained people. From the enterprise, this premium on achieve-
ment has spread to the whole society. For this reason, industrial so-
cieties need a minimum—if not a maximum—of social mobility; and
for this reason also, the educational institutions have grown, in indus-
trial societies, into the place of agents of role allocation.
Like rationality and achievement, equality
is also a value which
characterizes all industrial societies, capitalist or otherwise. We have
seen that legal equality is not merely compatible with, but conditional
for the capitalist class system. Even Marx realized, despite his scorn
for the "purely formal" ideology of equality, that "this one condition
comprehendsa world history" (12, 1, p. 178). But we have also seen
that "this one condition" has not remained confined to equality before
the law, and its extension to other spheres was probably no accident.
Inequalities of status, legal and social, obstruct the formation of ra-
tional organizations in which the place of individuals
is determined
by achievement. Although the realization of equality remained piti-
fully imperfect in capitalist societies, it was a part of the program of
these as it is of their successors.
There
is only one point at which the changes in the structure of
industrial
societies
since Marx might appear
to have
affected
the
values of these societies.
It
is often said that modern societies are
always "open" (Weber) or "adaptive" (Mayo). And in seeking for
an explanation of such terms one may encounter statements like: "We
have in fact passed beyond that stage of human organization in which
effective communication and collaboration were secured by established
routines of relationship" ( 1 54, p.
1 2) ."
But, then, this kind of state-
ment is simply a misunderstanding of social reality. As I have pointed
out before, post-capitalist societies do in fact display effective routines
of human cooperation (e.g., the institutionalization of class conflict),
but this is not a reason for assuming a change in values. The fact that
the values of industrial societies were realized incompletely in their
^^ This formulation, by the way,
is a typical example of a statement which,
in
its logical status,
is not sociological in that
it does not permit of empirical
test.
This
in
itself would be sufficient reason to be skeptical about
its validity.

earliest, capitalist, forms is not surprising, nor does
it affect the im-
portance of these values for both capitalist and post-capitalist phases
of development. We can conclude with some confidence that the social
changes discussed in this chapter have all been compatible with, and
to some extent consequent of, certain social values which advanced
industrial societies share with their capitalist precursors.^^
Apart from these social values, certain other elements of the social
structure of industrial societies have also survived the changes of the
past century and are therefore characteristic of capitalist and industrial
societies alike.
These structural features are so formal and general
in nature that they may well be elements not only of industrial but
also of all human societies.
Yet, while this general problem need not
concern us here, they have to be mentioned, for they both have a spe-
cial bearing on class structure and conflict.
I mean, here, the existence
of social stratification and of authority relations.
Although, as the preceding discussion has incidentally brought
out,
patterns of
social
stratification have undergone
considerable
changes in the course of the last hundred years, these changes have
not affected the existence of a hierarchical differentiation of status,
and there is no indication that hierarchies of socioeconomic status will
disappear in the foreseeable future. There still are rewards to be dis-
tributed by society, these are still desired by individuals, and the dis-
tribution of desired rewards is still unequal.
I think one can go one
step further and add that, by and large, the criterion by which rewards
are unequally distributed is still that of occupation. Many contem-
porary sociologists believe that we have left the age of work and pro-
duction and entered an era of leisure and consumption.
But to the
present day the extent of a person's leisure, as well as the level of his
consumption, is entirely determined by his occupation and the rewards
associated with
it. Whatever criterion of social stratification one pre-
fers, prestige or income, spending habits or styles of life, education
or independence, they all lead back to occupation.
Social stratification
based on occupation
is as such neither the whole nor a part of class
structure, but
it does constitute an element of inequality which has
^^ A second conclusion that can and must be drawn from this analysis of changing
structures within unchanged values has to do with the usefulness of the value concept
for the analysis of social change.
Despite their boundaries, the changes discussed
in
this chapter are by no means unimportant; yet
it would be hard
if not impossible to
retrace them on the level of values. Thus
it would appear that only long-term changes
(lii<e the emergence of industrial society) can be fruitfully analyzed in terms of values;
for the other changes,
it seems best to analyze them in terms of structural elements.

Ji
persisted and which continues to influence the issues and patterns of
social conflict.
This
is even more clearly the case with respect to relations of
domination and subordination as they exist in social organizations of
both capitalist and post-capitalist industrial societies. The assertion
that there still are authority relations in industry, in the state, and in
many other forms of social organization does not go unchallenged in
contemporary sociology.
In surveying recent theories of conflict in
the following chapter, we shall encounter a number of authors who
believe that power
is a thing of the past.
Short of anticipating this
discussion and giving a precise definition of what is meant by power
and authority, I would here merely assert this:
in post-capitalist as
in capitalist industrial enterprises there are some whose task
it
is to
control the actions of others and issue commands, and others who have
to allow themselves to be controlled and who have to obey. Today
as a hundred years ago there are governments, parliaments, and courts
the members of which are entitled to make decisions that affect the
lives of many citizens, and there are citizens who can protest and shift
their vote but who have to abide by the law.
Insofar as either of these
relations can be described as one of authority, I would claim that rela-
tions of domination and subordination have persisted throughout the
changes of the past century.
Again,
I believe that we can go even
further. The authority exercised in both capitalist and post-capitalist
society is of the same type j it is, in Weber's terms, "rational authority"
based "on the belief in the legality of institutionalized norms and the
right of command on the part of those invested with authority by these
norms" (33^^, p. 124). From this condition many others, including
the necessity of bureaucratic administration, follow.
But these are
based above
all on the fundamental
social
inequality of authority
which may be mitigated by its "rational" character, but that neverthe-
less pervades the structure of all industrial societies and provides both
the determinant and the substance of most conflicts and clashes.

Some Recent Theories of Class Conflict in
Modem Societies
REFUTATION IS NOT ENOUGH
Our account of changes in the structure of industrial societies since
Marx has been largely descriptive, although
I have tried to weave
a number of threads of development into some main cords.
Descrip-
tion, however, is but the basis of scientific knowledge, not its proper
substance.
I am not sure whether Merton's statement that
".
.
.
in
building the mansion of sociology during the last decades, theorists
and empiricists have learned to work together" (214, p. 102) was not
a little premature when he made it in 1 948. Merton may well be right
in his claim that empirical research can serve to inspire, transform,
redirect, and clarify theories, apart from testing them. But it is still
necessary to emphasize that fact-finding is not in itself explanation,
and that therefore "empirical research" cannot replace "theoretical
insight."'
With respect to Marx's theories of class formation and class con-
flict the overwhelming majority of social scientists have failed to pro-
ceed beyond the level of description. There is a growing number of
studies about occupational prestige and social mobility. A library of
social psychological and sociological monographs has been written
about the "new middle class."
There are numerous investigations
into trends of social stratification, egalitarian or otherwise.
Research
in industrial sociology often touches upon problems of industrial con-
flict and the authority structure of the enterprise. But the authors of
all these studies would do well to call them sociographic rather than
sociological investigations. There is no lack of data, but cut bono} Of
what use is the remark found in many a research report that its results
rrfute one thesis or another thesis of Marx's? What is the use of re-

futing one or the other thesis, if the progress of science stops at this
early point?
It
is certainly of some moment to refute theories and
hypotheses derived from them.
But
it
is more important to super-
sede, on the basis of such refutations, the theories themselves, and to
put better and more satisfactory ones in their place. From this point
of view all the authors whose approaches we shall discuss in this chap-
ter have advanced far beyond the so-called pure empiricists.
Theory is "the net which we throw out in order to catch
^the
world'—to
rationalize,
explain, and dominate
it"
(Popper,
218,
p. 26).
In this sense, a theory is "more" than a particular hypothesis,
and a hypothesis
is "more" than a concept or category.
For Marx,
"class" is a category.
Its substance can be found by observation and
described by the category. Thus the statement that "the proletariat
is a class" is descriptive in that it subsumes an empirical datum under
a concept. But the statement that the proletariat is involved in a con-
flict with the bourgeoisie which can only be solved by a revolution is
a hypothesis.
It is derived from a theory, from which other hypoth-
eses are also derived j we have called it Marx's theory of class conflict.
According to this theory, every society generates in its structure con-
flicting classes which develop in a certain way and the conflict of which
eventually leads to structural upheavals. Thus a theory is a general
"point of view" which structures an area of facts and transforms
it
into an ordered context. As scientists, it is not our task to "select only
such facts as confirm the theory and, as it were, repeat it; the method
of science is rather to look out for facts which refute the theory" (Pop-
per, 219, II, p. 260).
Facts refute theories by proving false one or
several hypotheses necessarily following from them."
In this sense,
we can conclude that Marx's theory of class conflict—insofar as
it
is
a scientific theory and not untestable speculation—has been refuted
by the "facts" discussed in the preceding chapter.
But the refutation of theories, although "the vehicle of scientific
progress" (Popper),
is not its substance.
Refutation of old theories
makes sense only if it becomes the point of departure for the develop-
ment of new theories. This is what is meant here by the supersedence
of a theory.
Such supersedence may assume several different forms.
In the case of Marx's theory of class it may mean that we restrict the
validity of this theory to a single, limited type of social organiza-
tion, such as capitalism.
Alternatively, it may involve reformulating
^ Properly speaking
it
is not "facts," but "statements of fact" that refute hypoth-
eses.
For a more detailed discussion of these methodological problems, see the quoted
works of Popper.

Marx's theory by modifying some of its elements.
Finally, we may
decide to dismiss this theory altogether and replace
it by an entirely
new theory of social conflict. However, one of these paths will have
to be chosen if we want to advance our knowledge of social conflict
and change.
In the present chapter, we shall discuss some recent at-
tempts to supersede Marx's theory in the light of historical facts and
sociological insights.
It will emerge from this discussion that none of
these approaches has substituted a satisfactory new theory for that of
Marx—that is, a theory which survives the test of observed data.
It
will then be our task to explore new paths and to hope that this ex-
ploration will contribute to the development of a useful theory of
social conflict. But before we embark on this long and at times some-
what tedious journey, it is unfortunately necessary to free the central
category of our analysis, the concept of class, of the jumble of mis-
conceptions which obscures its meaning today, and to try and reinstate
it in its proper place.
THE DILUTION OF THE CONCEPT OF CLASS
The history of the concept of class in sociology
is surely one of
the most extreme illustrations of the inability of sociologists to achieve
a minimum of consensus even in the modest business of terminological
decisions.^ Only recently, Geiger, Lipset and Bendix, and some others
have unraveled the conceptual confusion a little and begun to inaugu-
rate a rather more rigid use of the category of class.
It
is not our
intention here to discuss all the versions and perversions of the con-
cept of class. That would be a task for the sociologist of knowledge j
indeed,
it has been done, with varying success and often not without
additional confusion, since Mombert (23) and Sorokin (30), who
counted thirty-two variations of the concept as early as thirty years
ago, by Geiger (91, 46), Marshall (58), Cox (40), Pfautz (97),
Lipset and Bendix
i^SS)-) Croner (129), and others.
For curiosity's
sake, then, rather than in order to attempt a comprehensive survey,
I shall quote here a small selection of definitions of the much abused
concept of class:
Class "is a force that unites into groups people who diff^er from one
another, by overriding the
diff^erences between them"
(Marshall,
57,
p. 114).
"Class, as distinguished from stratum, can well be regarded as a psy-
' I have discussed the conceptual problems raised here more extensively
in an
essay (41).

chological phenomenon in the fullest sense of the term. That is, a man's
class is a part of his ego, a feeling on his part of belongingness to some-
thing j an identification with something larger than himself" (Centers,
38, p. 27).
"We shall then mean by a social class any portion of a community
which is marked off from the rest, not by limitations arising out of lan-
guage, locality, function, or specialization, but primarily by social status"
(Maclver,211,p. 167).
"According to the point of view here advanced, social classes
.
.
.
are
social groups determined by three factors, namely,
( 1 ) similar social con-
ditions, (2) similar social status, (3) similar social values" (Croner, 129,
p. 185).
"By class is meant two or more orders of people who are believed to be,
and are accordingly ranked by the members of the community, in socially
superior and inferior positions" (Warner and Lunt, 100, p. 82).
Whoever reads these definitions may well be tempted to regard
sociology as rather a frivolous discipline.
Indeed, theories can neither
be formulated nor refuted on the basis of these definitions, some of
which are plainly bare of substance, others too profuse, and all far
removed from the original purpose of the concept of class. Attempts
have been made to classify the multitude of existing concepts of class
itself.
Usually, "objective" and "subjective" definitions of class are
distinguished; Pfautz has added to this the distinction between "ex-
ternal objective," and "internal objective" approaches
(97).
But
such attempts achieve the opposite of their purpose,
if this may be
suspected in a clarification of the concept. We are indeed faced with
an alternative:
either we renounce the discredited term "class" alto-
gether and endeavor to find a less ambiguous set of terms, or we reject
radically all definitions which depart from the original, i.e., Marxian
heuristic purpose, and return to this source.
In a historical discipline it is always difficult to take a "protestant"
view and ignore traditions. While the attempt to reinstate the concept
of class in
its original meaning is methodologically unobjectionable,
we must also ask whether it is pragmatically feasible. There are legiti-
mate doubts about the latter aspect, and to some extent I share these
doubts.
As a tentative and reversible decision, however,
I propose
to retain the term "class" and contrast it with others for which alterna-
tive terms have already begun to become accepted. The criterion by
which this distinction seems possible
is the heuristic purpose of the
categories in question. From this point of view, we shall have to reject
all definitions of class as a category of social stratification whether

----- Page 94 (native) -----

they be "internal objective," "external objective," or "subjective."
Wherever classes are defined by factors which permit the construction
of a hierarchical continuum, they are wrongly defined 5
i.e., the term
has been applied wrongly.
Status, ranking by others, self-ranking,
style of life, similar economic conditions, and income level are all
factors which define social strata but not social classes. However one
may interpret, extend, or improve Marx, classes in his sense are clearly
not layers in a hierarchical system of strata differentiated by gradual
distinctions.
Rather, "the analysis of social class is concerned with an
assessment of the chances that common economic conditions and com-
mon experiences of a group will lead to organized action" (Lipset and
Bendix,
sS-> P- 2,48).*
Class is always a category for purposes of the
analysis of the dynamics of social conflict and its structural roots, and
as such
it has to be separated strictly from stratum as a category for
purposes of describing hierarchical systems at a given point of time.
This statement of the meaning of the concept of class (or, rather,
of what
it cannot properly mean) automatically excludes from the
present
investigation
a large number of
sociological works which
overtly deal with "classes." For example, Warner's six-"class" theory
(75,
100)—if
it deserves the name of theory
at
all—constitutes
neither a refutation nor a supersession of Marx's theory of class.
It
cannot be conceived as such, for, using the terms correctly, Warner
should have referred
to his groups of equal rank not
as "upper-
upper classy^ "lower-upper classj** etc., but as "upper-upper Stratum,*
"lower-upper stratum,**
etc.
In the following discussion of recent
theories, we shall therefore confine ourselves to three types of ap-
proaches: those which are explicitly based on what, with a deliberate
overstatement,
I shall now call the correct concept of
class 5
those
whose authors assert that they are based on the correct concept of class
;
and those which, although they are not based on
this concept, are
formulated in such a way as to suggest that they might genuinely
supersede Marx's theory of class.
Obviously, even those post-Marx-
ian theories of class which conform with these standards are too numer-
ous all to be included in a brief discussion. A comprehensive sum-
mary and critique of these theories would require a lengthy book in
itself.
I have therefore selected, from a multitude of works, those
which are comparatively recent and which are consequently not them-
* At a later stage,
I shall raise some objections to the exclusive reference to "eco-
nomic conditions" in statements of this kind; they are nevertheless true to the heuristic
purpose of the concept of class.

Fur-
thermore, I have tried to choose examples which are characteristic of
entire schools of thought.
In this chapter, I have also left out purely-
conceptual discussions, some of which will be mentioned later, and I
have concentrated on analyses of modern societies in terms of class
structure and class conflict.
Finally, my selection has been guided by
the fruitfulness of approaches for a new sociological theory of con-
flict, the formulation of which constitutes the ultimate aim of the
present study.
ON AND OFF THE PARTY LINE
(Nemchinov, Djilas)
Evidently, those are faced by the most difiicult problems of analy-
sis who, by a philosophical or political decision, are bound to main-
tain Marx's theory
in
all
essential
features
as
an
instrument
of
sociological explanation. One need hardly mention that this kind of
decision makes fruitful
scientific research and
analysis
impossible.
Dogmatic insistence on
scientific theories always mars the progress
of knowledge.
Quite possibly, this
is one of the reasons why many
of the analyses presented by Soviet scholars are so sterile and naive
that
in non-Communist countries they would hardly be acceptable
for publication in scholarly journals or by serious publishers. Thus
the brief study by Nemchinov (64), a member of the Soviet Academy
of Sciences, is distinguished from the mass of these analyses not by its
profoundness or thoroughness, but by its subject matter which Marx-
ist social scientists'' have been extremely hesitant to deal with, namely
"changes in the class structure of the population of the Soviet Union."
To begin with, Nemchinov recalls the original definition of class
and distinguishes it from the notion of social stratification, with which
the analysis of class has in his opinion been confused in the West in
an impermissible manner.
"Thus, the objective criteria for the de-
termination of social classes are the position of the society member in
the occupation and the character of his income, determined by the pre-
' This criterion excludes the whole Marxist
literature.
While
a
discussion of
Marxist thinking on class from Kautsky to Lukacs and further would certainly promise
many a useful result,
it seemed to me an unnecessary ballast in a book that
is primarily
concerned not with Marx but with social conflict.
® Perhaps it would be more precise to speak here of "Marxist-Leninist" or "ortho-
dox Marxist"
authors,
for among
Marxians,
i.e.,
scholars who
profess
a
scientific
(which means last, not least, critical)
relation to Marx, there have been many serious
studies of class.
See, e.g., the work of Djilas discussed below.

vailing form of property and the type of productive relations in which
individual members stand
to other members under the
particular
system of social labor"
(p. 14)/
There
is but one interesting and
potentially
consequential
point
at which Nemchinov supplements
Marx's theory. He
separates, both
conceptually and
empirically,
property and power, and he states that in bourgeois society "it is be-
yond any doubt that to a greatest extent property relations provide
an all-round
control over the
living conditions of
the workers,"
whereas "common ownership of the means of production in the USSR
makes
it impossible
to transform private income
into
a source of
power" (p.. 1 3).
This does not, of course, contradict the position of
Marx, for whom effective private property, and not property in gen-
eral, was the determinant of class structure, but it nevertheless opens
up unexpected vistas.
If property can, but must not, convey power,
a curious alternative emerges of which Nemchinov has chosen the
dogmatic, untenable side, whereas Djilas, as we shall presently see,
chose to apply Marx's theory plausibly, although
critically.
Nem-
chinov does not hesitate to state his "theoretical position" quite un-
ambiguously. "The great historical changes of the twentieth century
and those of the past centuries
[
! ] have confirmed the scientific ob-
jectivity, truth and validity of the theory of social classes formulated
by Marx and later developed and worked out by Lenin" (p. 3).
It
is nice to know that Lenin's "objectivity, truth and validity" was as-
sured even before he was born. But if we ignore for the moment the
fact that this statement
is a confession rather than a proposition, we
must ask : In what sense could it possibly be valid ? How does a theory
based on such beliefs cope with the changes which industrial societies
have undergone since Marx?
Nemchinov takes a stand only with respect to two of the changes
we discussed in the preceding chapter:
to the problems of property
and of the "middle class." Moreover as to the first of these, he has
no more to offer than a few dogmatic assertions. "The material basis
of bourgeois hegemony lies in the private ownership of the means
of production.
.
.
. The workers in a capitalist society do not pos-
sess the means of production and are obliged to sell their labour to
the employer, the owner of the means of production" (p. 12).
This
is but an
inferior repetition of Marx and ignores completely the
^ Nemchinov's essay, as well as the paper by his colleague P. N. Fedoseyev quoted
below, was originally submitted to the Third World Congress of Sociology in English.
All quotations are from these English texts.
It
is evident, however, that the translators
at the disposal of the Soviet Academy of Sciences are rather inferior to those employed
by the Soviet government and the Politbureau.

phenomenon of the separation of ownership and control.
However,
Nemchinov's colleague Fedoseyev (45)
settled this problem in ac-
cordance with the party line, although I have to confess that
I find
his approach more amusing than impressive.
Fedoseyev thinks that
"it
is not
difficult to understand that the replacement of the indi-
vidual capitalist owners by corporative monopolistic capital does not
mean
at
all that the
capitalist
class disappears.
The place of the
individual owners of the capitalist enterprises
is taken by the par-
ticipants of the monopolistic unions, by the magnates of
financial
capital, millionaires and multimillionaires, who exploit the working
people through the system of trusts, joint-stock companies, banks and
state-capitalist enterprises" (45, p. 267). Had Fedoseyev read his
Marx more thoroughly, he would have known that "the place of the
individual owners" has been taken by at least two sets of people, of
which one, the managers, can hardly be described as magnates and
multimillionaires.
But perhaps such plain facts are too insignificant
for the imagination of Soviet thinkers.
Not
unexpectedly, Nemchinov and Fedoseyev
are
essentially
agreed with respect
to the "middle
class."
"The problem of the
so-called middle classes plays a great role
in the theory of
social
classes.
Bourgeois sociologists assume that homogeneous societies can
be achieved as a result of the growth and development of the middle
classes" (64, p. 6).
So far so good. But what
is the "true" place of
the middle class?
"History has, however, shown," says Nemchinov
(p. 6), "that this social group
is economically unstable and subject
to class disintegration." Fedoseyev goes even further.
According to
him, the middle strata "have declined not only in their specific share
in production, but also in their numbers" (p. 268).
Evidently, both
authors refer here to the "old middle classes" of peasants, artisans,
and shopkeepers. As to the "new middle class," Nemchinov confines
himself to criticizing Clark's distinction of "primary," "secondary,"
and "tertiary" industries and asserting that the latter are "undoubt-
edly the continuation of the process of production and must come
under social production"
(p.
8), and that therefore the old classes
exist in these as in older forms of production.*
There is, however, one aspect of Nemchinov's analysis which leads
^ Nemchinov's disinclination to accept Clark's distinctions seems to me a charac-
teristic
illustration
of
the
"sterility" and "naivete"
of orthodox Marxist
analyses:
many concepts which are both useful and necessary for descriptive purposes are simply
denied, as if such denials could conjure away the realities described by such concepts.
This kind of deliberate primitiveness of the
scientific instrumentarium makes com-
munication difficult and differentiated insights virtually impossible.

----- Page 98 (native) -----

beyond such stereotyped repetitions of dogma. He deals
at some
length with the position of specialists, professional people, and higher
technical and administrative employees.
Nemchinov refers
to
this
group as the "intelligentsia," or "intellectuals." "The intellectuals
are an intermediate social group, the class character of which
is de-
termined by the prevailing method of social production. Under capi-
talism, intellectuals stem mostly from the propertied classes and are
closely connected with their own class. Among them there are also
representatives of the workers' intelligentsia, closely connected with
the peasantry and the working class.
In socialist society intellectuals
are mostly drafted from the workers and collective farmers and are
closely connected with the working masses.
Nevertheless the intelli-
gentsia cannot be considered, under capitalism as well as under com-
munism, as a special middle
class.
They are only an intermediate
social group, existing along with the basic social classes" (pp. 9-10).
Elsewhere, Nemchinov describes this group as an "intermediate social
stratum."
Here we find indeed something like a precarious theoretical at-
tempt to explain a new phenomenon of social development with the
categories of the old theory of class. However, this attempt is, in the
first place, based on erroneous statements of fact.
With respect to
the Soviet Union, we still know comparatively little about the social
origin of the
"intelligentsia."
But
in
"capitalist
societies"
of the
present, this group
is by no means solely, or even mainly, recruited
from the "propertied classes."
If we look at contemporary England
(1949) as an example, we find that of all men in the status catego-
ries I, 2, and 3 of D. V. Glass's study (107)—i.e., all higher salaried
employees, and people in managerial and professional occupations
24.3 per cent (category i), 40.9 per cent (category 2), and 62.1
per cent (category 3), respectively, were recruited from strata which
Nemchinov would count among the "working class" (108, p. 183).
Nemchinov has bracketed out the phenomenon of social mobility in
advanced industrial societies, and his theory therefore explains at best
one aspect of the social changes that have occurred since Marx.
But does
it really explain this aspect?
It
is Nemchinov's thesis
that the "intelligentsia" is in principle a stratum which is neutral from
the point of view of class, and which does not therefore constitute
an autonomous force in class conflicts. Were
it not for Nemchinov's
definition of this group, this might sound rather like A. Weber's and
Mannheim's theory of the "free-floating" or "socially unattached
intelligentsia."
But we must remember that Nemchinov includes in

----- Page 99 (native) -----
Recent Theories
8i
the "intelligentsia" apart from "intellectuals" proper the "techni-
cians employed in various branches of industry" as well as "admin-
istrative workers," which latter groups presumably constitute the ma-
jority of this strange stratum.
It includes, indeed—as soon as Nem-
chinov refers to Soviet society—government ministers, party func-
tionaries, and the managers of industrial enterprises.
In other words,
Nemchinov claims that the incumbents of positions of authority in
state and industry, and their bureaucracies, neither are a social class
themselves nor provide a reason to modify Marx^s theory of class
at any point. We shall see presently that the first of these claims
is
a matter of dogma rather than of Marxian analysis; for on this point
Djilas's analysis seems perfectly convincing. The second of Nem-
chinov^s claims, however, is manifestly false and leads its author into
interesting contradictions.
If it is true that the bureaucratic managers
of state and industry do not form a class, and if it is further true that
contemporary Western societies are still class societies in Marx's sense,
then it follows that mere property (of shares, for example) without
control can be the basis and determinant of a class.
This consequence
would undoubtedly modify Marx's theory, and it would reveal Nem-
chinov as a representative of the "vulgar mind" which "commutes
class differences into ^differences in the size of the purse' " (Marx, 5,
p. 466).
If, on the other hand, the incumbents of leading bureau-
cratic positions do form a class in Western societies,
it is hard to see
why in the Soviet Union they should be a mere "stratum," an out-
growth of the working class.
Nemchinov's venture in social theory
manages to repeat Marx's theory up to a point, but it falls victim also
to the changed patterns of advanced industrial society.
Where Soviet social science refers to the West,
it
is almost in-
variably unconvincing, but also often colorful and amusing.
"The
abyss between labour and capital, between working people and ex-
ploiters is not filled, but deepened, for the profits of the monopolists
grow, whereas the share of the masses of the population in the national
income steadily falls. The growth of technology leads to the inten-
sification of labour and to greater exploitation of workers.
This
is
the source of the aggravation of social contradictions and the basis
of continuous class struggle in the capitalist countries" (Fedoseyev,
45, p. 268).
However, where Soviet social science refers to Com-
munist countries,
it
is not only unconvincing but
also remarkably
barren and boring. Nemchinov reiterates in detail Stalin's theory of
"nonantagonistic classes"—without of course mentioning, in 1956, its
author. "The modern class structure of Soviet society has been re-

----- Page 100 (native) -----

fleeted in the Soviet Constitution of 1936.
At present Soviet society
consists of two
basic
classes, the working
class and the
collective
farmers,^ as well as a social stratum, the intelligentsia" (p. 22). That
the mere attempt to extend the concept of class in this fashion bears
witness to the "inadequacy of the classical Marxist-Leninist concep-
tion of class," Nemchinov could have learned from his less dogmatic
Polish colleague Ossowski
{^G^i^ p. 24).
That
it conceals rather than
reveals and explains the realities of Soviet society seems evident, and
has been convincingly demonstrated by Djilas's analysis of the "new
class" (44).
Djilas's work
is of interest in our discussion, because
its author
applies a fairly strict Marxian approach to the analysis of Communist
societies.
Its subject matter
is precisely that odd "intelligentsia" of
managers, party secretaries, and bureaucrats which—if Nemchinov's
study is at all symptomatic—appears to have puzzled Soviet scholars
for some time.
Only, Djilas cuts deeper than Nemchinov. He is not
content with the problematic construction of an "intermediate social
stratum" which belongs neither here nor there, but instead explicitly
calls this "intelligentsia" a new ruling class with
its own very special
social characteristics.
"It is the bureaucracy which formally uses, ad-
ministers, and controls both nationalized and socialized property as
well as the entire life of society. The role of the bureaucracy in so-
ciety, i.e., monopolistic administration and control of national income
and national goods, consigns
it to a special privileged position.
.
.
.
Ownership
is nothing other than the right of profit and control.
If
one defines class benefits by this right, the Communist
states have
seen, in the final analysis, the origin of a new form of ownership or
of a new ruling and exploiting class" (44, p.
'}^'^^.
The main peculiarity of the bureaucratic ruling class of Commu-
nist societies
is, according to Djilas, that
it has not grown spontane-
ously like other classes in history, but has been the deliberate creation
of a party elite.
It follows from this fact that the rule of the new
class
is more brutal and all-embracing than that of any other class
in history.
But otherwise this "new class of owners and exploiters"
(p. 54) resembles earlier
classes
in many ways.
Its domination
is
based on ownership, for, as Djilas argues at great length, "collective
ownership" is but a facade behind which "this new class, the bureauc-
racy, or more accurately the political bureaucracy" (p. 38), exercises
^ See 64, p.
15.
"The workers and collective farmers are friendly classes

USSR,
as their material interests are not opposed.

."

83
its control. Coupled with its "monopolistic ownership" the new class
has "totalitarian authority," that is, its power extends over all spheres
of life.
Like earlier classes, it tries to legitimize its rule by an elabo-
rate ideology.
Finally, Djilas hopes and predicts
that,
like other
classes in history, this new class will also be overthrown and displaced
in a revolutionary action of the oppressed.
Djilas naturally does not include the contemporary Western scene
in his analysis, so that we cannot infer from his work how he would
try to modify Marx's theory to
fit the Western
case.
But
it
is an
important fact to remember that his analysis shows that a fairly strict
Marxian analysis might
still be applicable to Communist countries.
This conclusion may mean either of two things.
It is conceivable that
a Marxian theory of
class
conflict
applies
fully only
to countries
undergoing the process of industrialization.
But
it
is also possible
that we can infer from Djilas's analysis that some kind of Marxian
theory is of more general usefulness and applicability.
I have delib-
erately referred to Djilas's approach as a fairly strict Marxian analy-
sis, and as so^ne kind of Marxian theory. There
is, in this approach,
a slight shift of emphasis at a crucial juncture of Marx's theory which
may prove essential to the problem of the applicability of this theory.
This shift of emphasis concerns the relation between ownership, or
property, and power.
I think
it can be shown that Djilas
is not unambiguous when he
speaks of the determinants of the new class. On the one hand, he
says, "As in other owning classes, the proof that
it
is a special class
lies in its ownership and its special relations to other classes" (p. 44),
or, "The specific characteristic of this new class
is
its collective own-
ership"
(p. 54). On the other hand, one can find a statement like,
"Today power
is both the means and the goal of Communists,
in
order that they may maintain their privileges and ownership.
But
since these are special forms of power and ownership, it is only through
power itself that ownership can be exercised. Power is an end in itself
and the essence of contemporary Communism" (p.
169).
There
is
at least a hint here that it is ultimately not the ownership of the means
of production that determines a class, but that this very ownership
is
only a special case of a more general social force, power. While Marx,
as we saw, subordinates relations of authority to those of property,
Djilas seems inclined to subordinate ownership to power. The prob-
lem of the relationship of these two factors will recur time and again
in the considerations of this study j and
it wilj,
I hope, become
in-
creasingly clear that in explaining social conflicts and changes, there

Is greater promise in an approach that follows Djilas than follows
Marx.
CAPITALISM, SOCIALISM, AND SOCIAL CLASSES
(Schumpeter)
It was of course not merely by Nemchinov, and not only in Com-
munist
countries,
that the attempt has been made
to save Marx's
theory of class as a principle of explanation for advanced industrial
societies. Two lines of argument are characteristic of such attempts
at rescue. On the one hand, certain new facts of social development,
such as the separation of ownership and control or social mobility, are
either denied or explained away.
This was done, for example, by
Kuczynski, whose attempts to "prove" the "pauperization" of the
proletariat
in
"capitalist"
societies despite
a continued
rise
in
real
wages (152) has been exposed by Geiger in all
its untenability and
even ridiculousness (46, pp. 60 ff.).
Obviously, a dogmatic approach
of this kind does not advance our knowledge of society. On the other
hand, seemingly unimportant elements of Marx's theory are modi-
fied by such "revisionists" without their realizing how the original
theory is being transformed in their hands. Thus, Renner introduced
in his early attempt at a systematic formulation of Marx's theories
(26) an interesting additional distinction. He argues that recent social
development has complicated class structure, especially the bourgeoi-
sie.
"It puts alongside the capitalist who owns and functions the other
one who owns but does not function.
.
.
. What
is more:
It also
produces the
non-capitalist who
exercises
capitalist
functions, who
therefore does not own but functions as a capitalist" (26, p. 375).
For us this is by now a familiar line of argument.
But if one regards
in this way the merely controlling manager as a "capitalist,"
i.e., as
the founder of a class, then class conflict is separated from its Marx-
ian root, private property.
The assertion loses
its meaning that
a
["socialist"] society based on communal property is a classless society.
Thus, an argument of this kind cannot save Marx's theory
either.
Saving Marx's theories
is of course in any case
a highly doubtful
undertaking, in which a social science should take good care not to
become involved. But in his early writings Renner has neither wanted
nor clearly seen the necessity of superseding Marx's theory of prop-
erty and social class^°j
it was Schumpeter who
first carried through
^° By contrast
to
the
later Renner, whose work
will be
discussed below.
The
attempt to supersede Marx on the basis of his own principles and yet retain the political
impetus of "scientific socialism" expresses itself even more clearly in the work of Ren-
ner than in that of Bernstein.

the conscious separation of Marx's theory of the development of
property from his theory of class conflict.
Schumpeter
poses Marx's
question
of
the
"economic law
of
development of
capitalist
society" anew.
Can
capitalism
survive?
And, can socialism work?
Both "capitalism" and "socialism" are for
Schumpeter categories that describe economic systems—in particular,
property relations.
In
this sense, Schumpeter agrees with Marx's
conclusion that the economic order of capitalism
is bound to break
down and give rise to a new economic constitution which
is socialist
in that it is based on communal or, as Schumpeter prefers to say, state
ownership.
This is a "necessary" process—not, however, in a Marx-
Hegelian sense of immanent laws of historical development, but as
a scientific "statement about the tendencies present in an observable
pattern," which does not "tell us what will happen to the pattern but
only what would happen if they continued to act as they have been
acting in the time interval covered by our observation and if no other
factors intruded" (73, p. 61).
If, up to this point, his analysis is quite compatible with that of
Marx, Schumpeter now goes his own way.
Socialism
is, as he says,
"culturally indeterminate J
.
.
.
in fact,
.
.
.
a society may be fully
and truly socialist and yet be led by an absolute ruler or be organ-
ized in the most democratic of all possible waysj
it may be aristocratic
or proletarian j
it may be a theocracy and hierarchic or atheist or in-
different as to religion j
it may be much more strictly disciplined than
men are in a modern army or completely lacking in discipline" (73,
pp. 170-71).
It may be—Schumpeter does not say so at this point,
but it corresponds to his conception—a class society or not. Although
this, too, has to be inferred from Schumpeter's text,
it would seem
that for him socialism betrays many traits of a class society 5
for the
work of workers "would remain substantially what
it is"
(p. 203)
j
"there will be plenty to fight about in socialist society" (p. 213), for
which "the problem of bureaucratic management"
is not the
least
cause (pp. 205 ff.).
For Schumpeter, this kind of analysis becomes possible by a com-
plete and deliberate departure from Marx's theory of class. "Marx
wished to define capitalism by the same trait that also defines his class
division. A little reflection will convince the reader that this
is not
a necessary or natural thing to do.
In fact
it was a bold stroke of
analytic strategy which linked the fate of the class phenomenon with
the fate of capitalism in such a way that socialism, which
in reality
has nothing to do with the presence or absence of social classes, be-

----- Page 104 (native) -----

came, by definition, the only possible kind of classless society, except-
ing primitive groups.
This ingenious tautology could not equally
well have been secured by any definitions of classes and of capitalism
other than those chosen by Marx—the definition by private owner-
ship of means of production" (p. 19).
It is evident from this passage that although Schumpeter would
like to retain the concept of class as an instrument of analysis, he
considers it a useful instrument only if it is freed of its Marxian con-
nection with private property. Thus we must ask: What kind of a
theory of class promises, in the opinion of Schumpeter, a more satis-
factory analysis of the processes of development of
industrial
so-
cieties? The answer
is, Schumpeter presents neither a theory nor an
analysis of class of his own. One might almost be tempted to believe
that his (potentially correct)
thesis of the "cultural indeterminate-
ness" of economic systems has led him to the (false) conclusion that
cultural and social processes cannot be explained systematically and
therefore do not permit scientific theories. However, this assumption
is contradicted by the fact that in an earlier work (27) Schumpeter
has in fact dealt extensively with the phenomenon of class and de-
veloped the rudiments of an original theory.
Unfortunately—and
I suspect that this
is the ultimate root of the uselessness of Schum-
peter's analysis for the explanation of class conflict and
its develop-
ment—this theory was based on a concept of class which we have
explicitly dismissed above, namely, that "class structure is an arrange-
ment of individuals according to their social rank as it varies by groups,
ultimately according to difFerences of ability j even more,
it
is based
on the fact of the institutionalization of such rank once achieved"
(27, p. 205).
Schumpeter himself defines the area of problems to
which his "classes" belong when elsewhere he refers to "social strata
or groups" and adds, "As is known, we call them social classes" (99,
p. 216).
Schumpeter's classes are indeed not classes but strata.
At one point of his analysis Schumpeter has begun to approach
a genuine supersedence of Marx's theory of class. He has shown that
the necessary connection between
the
existence of
classes and the
existence of private property asserted by Marx is empirically untena-
ble. Thus he has opened up the possibility—later seized by Djilas
of analyzing also, with the instrument of class theory,
societies
in
which private property no longer functions or exists. But Schumpeter
has, by diluting the concept of class into that of stratum, made
it
impossible for himself to make use of this critical decision.

vate property, goes further
here,
if he
states with
respect
to the
transition, from capitalist to modern industrial societies that "the new
social order does not emerge without classes" (74, p. 205). However,
Sering's analysis (which
is
not, on the whole, very original)
pre-
supposes another theory which under the name of the "managerial
revolution" has become a widely used slogan.
THE MANAGERIAL AND THE CLERICAL REVOLUTIONS
(Burnham, Croner)
Although James Burnham refers with
suspicious frequency
to
science in general and the scientific nature of his analyses in particu-
lar, his theories are not very clear and his analyses not very acute/^
He wants to establish the fact of a social revolution, and yet he says
(140, p. 7), "I am going to assume further
.
.
.
that the present is
in fact a period of social revolution."
At one point, the managers,
dramatis fersonae of his revolution, are described rather specifically
as "the operating executives, production managers, plant superintend-
ents, and their associates"
(p. 82)
j but later this concept suddenly
includes not merely "production executives" and
"directing engi-
neers," but also quite generally "administrators," "propaganda spe-
cialists," and "technocrats"
(p. 281). He proposes to demonstrate
that the managers are everywhere about to assume power, but many
of his formulations lend support to the suspicion that he simply calls
managers those who are powerful.
It would not be difficult to dis-
miss Burnham's theory almost oifhand if all we wanted to prove was
that
it
is formulated in a most unsatisfactory manner and therefore
not, as such, a useful instrument of sociological analysis.
However,
I propose to avoid this simple path and try to explicate in the work
of Burnham the elements of a theory that might supersede Marx's.
Burnham, too, starts off by discussing the tendency to supersede
capitalism which
is inherent in modern economic and social develop-
ment. The new fact which he
is trying to explain
is the phenomenon
described above as the separation of ownership and control.
Burn-
ham. does not like this expression. "The truth
is that, whatever
its
legal merits, the concept of 'the separation of ownership and controP
has no sociological or historical meaning.
Ownership means control
\
if there is no control, then there is no ownership. ...
If ownership
and control are in reality separated, then ownership has changed hands
^^ He
is also not the
first author to present a theory of managerial rule, as Schel-
sky has pointed out with reference
to Veblen, Rathenau, and others
(cf.' 164).

Recent Theories
to the Control,' and the separated ownership is a meaningless fiction"
(p.
92).
Terminological
(and
confused)
as
this argument may
appear,
it
is nevertheless basic for Burnham's theory.
Because he
defines property ownership^^ by control, he can describe the transi-
tion of control over industrial means of production from owner-
managers to mere managers as a process which leads to the super-
sedence of capitalism without affecting class conflict in
its Marxian
definition as relating to property ownership.
"In all complex societies so far, there
is a particular, and rela-
tively small, group of men that controls the chief instruments of
production" (p. 59).
In capitalist society this was the capitalist class.
But in the society toward which we tend today "the managers will,
in
fact, have achieved social dominance, will be the ruling class in
society" (p. 72).
In this society, legal property lies with the state,
but factual control over the means of production is exercised by the
managers who, in this sense, are their owners. And "the instruments
of production are the seat of social domination j who controls them,
in fact not in name, controls society, for they are the means whereby
society lives"
(p. 125).
Like their capitalist predecessors, the new
"owners" of the means of production, the managers, are confronted
with the propertyless class of workers. "The managerial economy is
in actuality the basis for a new kind of exploiting, class society"
(p.
122).
Indeed, exploitation
is worse here than in capitalist society.
On the one hand, the working class becomes increasingly homogene-
ous, for "in comparison with the organization of industry in the period
prior to modern mass production, the individual tasks
.
.
.
require
relatively less skill and training on the part of the individual worker"
(p. 77). There is a wide gap between largely unskilled workers and
highly specialized managers. On the other hand, in bureaucratized
managerial societies, even the dubious liberty to sell his labor is taken
from the worker and he is forced to work (cf. p. 130). We are still
in a "transition period," but before long all industrial societies will
be managerial class societies.
Clearly, Burnham's theory, even
if
it proves useful, can at best
only partially supersede Marx's theory of class.
It
is based on one
^^ An accident of language has probably contributed to no small extent to make
Burnham's theory possible. The German word Eigentum comprises both the passive
"property" and the active "ownership," and whereas a separation of property and con-
trol
is a plausible occurrence, one of ownership and control seems indeed somewhat
doubtful,
i.e., the element of control
is indeed somewhere implied in the term owner-
ship, though not in property.

----- Page 107 (native) -----

89
new fact, the separation of ownership and control. We can therefore
trace
it back to Renner's somewhat liberal interpretation of Marx,
or even to Marx's own analysis of the phenomenon of joint-stock
companies.
(Incidentally, Burnham's identification of the managerial
rule with state property in the means of production indicates an im-
portant limiting case, but
it
is really quite unnecessary j the separa-
tion of legal and effective ownership would be fully sufficient for his
theory.)
Other tendencies of development of
industrial
societies,
such as the growth of social mobility, do not contradict Burnham's
theory but remain unexplained by it. The theory of managers merely
modifies one aspect of Marx's approach.
There are, moreover, a number of tendencies which directly con-
tradict Burnham's theory. Burnham follows Marx in asserting the
increasing homogeneity of the working class, brought about by virtue
of the leveling of their skills and qualifications. We have seen that
this thesis
is false. The working class has not in fact become more
uniform with respect either to its skill structure or to differentiations
of income and prestige j there are, rather, tendencies to the opposite.
Burnham further refers to an increase in the intensity of class con-
flict in managerial society.
This assertion, too,
is hardly compatible
with what we have described as the institutionalization of class con-
flict, nor, for that matter, does
it agree with the fact that the legiti-
macy of managerial authority rests to a considerable extent on the
consensus of those subjected to this authority.
Also, as we have seen,
there are many tendencies toward decreasing the intensity of
class
conflict and toward enlarging the sphere of institutionally regulated
clashes.
Here, too, Burnham
is in error.
However, the crucial and most problematic aspect of Burnham's
theory is that he blindly follows Marx in identifying economic with
political power and domination. "The sources of wealth and power
are the basic instruments of production, these are to be directed by
the managers J and the managers are, then, to be the ruling class"
(pp.
158 f.).
Not surprisingly, Burnham's
critics pounced on
this
observation. "The real question is," states Bendix (126, pp. 119 f.),
"whether (i) men who control the policies of industries, govern-
ment, labor unions, farm groups,
etc.,
constitute a cohesive group
owing to this common characteristic; or (2) the ideas and policies of
the so-called managerial group differ in any respect from those of
the older type of entrepreneur." These are both empirical questions
which cannot be answered by dogmas or definitions.
But Burnham
neither proved nor could he prove that in real societies the property-

----- Page 108 (native) -----

Recent Theories
less managers of industry are in any sense identical with the ruling
groups of the state.
Instead
it appears that "either by violating the
principle of identity or by taking the term 'manager' as an emblematic
slogan to mean those in power, Burnham exploits the facts concern-
ing the growth of bureaucratic structures for his own thesis" (Gerth
and Mills, 148, p. 173).
Burnham tried to abridge the pedestrian process of scientific dis-
covery, and for this he had to pay. The facts which he wants to con-
nect systematically in his theory originate in the sphere of industrial
production.
But the theory which he presents claims to be a valid
explanation of the development of the entire
society.
Between
its
claim and
its basis there gapes an abyss of implicit assumptions and
dogmatic assertions. The value of Burnham's theory lies in
its con-
sequence that the class structure of the industrial enterprise
is based
on control and not on legal ownership of the means of production.
^^
With this hypothesis, the separation of ownership and control becomes
a phenomenon which
is fundamentally irrelevant for class conflict.
But the problem of political conflicts in advanced industrial societies is
logically and empirically independent of that of the class structure
of the enterprise and must therefore be investigated separately. The
simple assertion that the means of production are the "seat of social
domination" explains little, even if
it
is repeated a hundred times.
In fact, many sociologists have tried for more than thirty years
to find an answer to the second, more comprehensive question of the
political structure of advanced industrial societies and
its class basis.
Usually, approaches to this problem are focused on the phenomenon
of bureaucracy,
i.e., on those parts of the "new middle class" which
are more
or
less intimately connected with
public
administration.
Burnham
tries in vain to ridicule what he
calls the "theory of the
bureaucratic revolution," and to dismiss it with a few superficial argu-
ments (pp. 278 ff.)
. No great effort is needed to realize that the analy-
ses of Max Weber and Michels, Bendix and Merton, and many
others" have contributed more to our knowledge of the structure of
contemporary societies than Burnham with his theory of the mana-
gerial revolution.
Yet neither Weber nor most of the subsequent
^^ Although
I would doubt whether
it
is sensible
to express
this approach with
Burnham by an extension of the definition of property ownership and to hide thereby
a substantial difTerence behind the verbal agreement with Marx.

Recent Theories

analysts of bureaucracy were explicitly concerned with developing a
theory which might lead to the supersedure of Marx's theory of class
in the light of new
facts.
Rudiments of such a theory can
first be
found in the work of Geiger to which we shall turn presently, and,
if on a much less ambitious level, in that of Fritz Croner
( 129).
Like Burnham, Croner believes he is able to perceive in the devel-
opment of industrial societies in the twentieth century a "social revo-
lution." "Everywhere the social revolution with which we are dealing
here has changed the face of society fundamentally. ...
Its product
and its bearer is a new social class:
white collar" (p. 9).
"Capitalist
order created in its beginning the social space for a new class, the exist-
ence of which rests on individual economic effort. The age of rational-
ization has also created the social space for a new class: the class of
salaried employees.
.
.
.
This process
is the real cause why society
today appears in an entirely different light than society fifty years ago:
this social process is the real substance of the ^social revolution' of our
time" (p. 246).
If Croner speaks of a "real cause" and of the "bear-
ers" of a social revolution, he evidently aims at an explanation of the
changed structures of advanced industrial societies. However, he does
not regard himself as an opponent or superseder of Marx. For him,
"there is no systematic theory of class in the work of Marx" (p. 169),
because Croner does not see, and much less realizes, the heuristic pur-
pose of the analysis of social conflict or the analytical departure from
antagonisms based on the distribution of property or power.
Thus,
he says "class" but he means "stratum" when he refers to "similar
economic conditions," "similar social status," and "similar social val-
ues" as determinants (p. 185). On the strength of this fact, we should
have to exclude Croner's contribution from this survey as being out-
side
its
scope.
Yet Croner
has presented—perhaps unwillingly
with his "theory of delegation" and his account of the functions of
white collar, an approach which might be understood as a contribution
to our discussion and which
I shall regard as such.
The "new" fact with which Croner
is concerned
is the spectacular
growth of the "new middle class" since 1890.
Croner explains this
fact as a subdivision of entrepreneurial functions in industry and of
leading positions
in the
state, which had become necessary
in
the
course of
rationalization.
"The
explanation
for the
special
social
position of salaried employees can be found in the fact that their work
tasks used
to be entrepreneurial
tasks"
(p.
36).
"What we
.
.
.
have said about the division of entrepreneurial 'power' and the re-

suiting emergence of certain 'services' in the economy, can be applied
also to the emergence of the civil 'service.' Here of course
it
is not
the entrepreneur, but the highest chief of state, e.g., the king, who
delegates certain tasks which he has so far carried out himself to men
of his confidence who then 'represent' the king in their fields" (p. 37)
Croner does not mention the separation of ownership and control,
but his "theory of delegation" presupposes this process to a certain
extent.
His approach also includes the explanation of one aspect of
social mobility,^^ if he says: "The salaried employees are a class with
considerable variations of income, influence and prestige.
.
.
. When
the salaried employee enters his first job, he may have a host of super-
ordinates. ... At the end of his career he may have hundreds and
thousands of subordinates.
.
.
. But this whole career occurs within
one and the same class" (p. 195).
One could derive from these statements a theory which would
argue approximately as follows. By the separation of ownership and
control and the rationalization of industrial and political administra-
tion, a new class of bureaucrats has emerged, the functions of which
are subdivided authority functions.
In this sense, the new class
is a
ruling class, and even the only ruling
class.
It
is mobile;
there
is
within it a continuous upward movement; and the class is by no means
uniform as a social stratum. But by virtue of its share in (delegated)
authority it is in conflict with all other groups in society.
To repeat
this, Croner himself does not formulate a theory of
this kind. The concept of ruling class plays no part in his investiga-
tion. Yet Croner's analysis contains certain elements of such a theory
—elements which can of course also be found in the works of Burn-
ham and of Weber and Michels, and which deserve our attention. The
historical trends which we have emphasized may suggest certain re-
strictions of this theory (such as of the notions of salaried employee
or bureaucracy), but they do not refute it. However, it is evident that
in speaking of bureaucracy as a ruling class one implies a concept of
class which has little to do with that of Marx. Whether some exten-
sion or modification of managerial and bureaucratic theories might be
considered a useful explanation of post-capitalist societies and their
conflicts, we cannot decide before we have settled the problem of
method, substance, and limits of class analysis in sociological research.
^^ Namely, intragcneration mobilit}'. The formulation quoted here might, how-
ever, also be thought to account
for the multitude of social origins of members of a
class in
a society
in which intergeneration mobility
is institutionalized.

CLASS SOCIETY WITHOUT CLASS CONFLICT
(Renner)
Both Burnham's and Croner's works suffer from the peculiar in-
consequence of books that were quite obviously written to be best-
sellers.
In profoundness of thought and significance of analysis they
compare badly with two late, posthumously published essays of the
Austrian Karl Renner (71), whose sociological work—if
it
is known
at all—is often underestimated. Renner refers to himself as a "Marx-
ist." But this epithet means for him that although he wants to retain
the "Marxian method" he is quite prepared to apply this "method"^^
in a critical and unprejudiced fashion to the new realities of post-
capitalist industrial society.
For
it
is for Renner "crystal-clear that
the
factual
substratum, the
social
substructure,
has changed com-
pletely in the last hundred years" (p. 214).
In fact, Renner begins
his analysis of class structure in the essays under discussion, contrary
to his program, with a critique of Marx's "method," of the theory
of class itself. He adds to the statement that for Marx private prop-
erty was the basis of class formation. "But obviously there have been
domination and exploitation of other kinds in history, and in my opin-
ion the Marxian school, although
it has not overlooked and has in
fact occasionally analyzed
these, has
failed
to
investigate system-
atically and balance with each other all historical and possible relations
of authority" (p. 89).
This sentence implies more than
its cautious
formulation betrays.
It
indicates
that Renner—much
like
Djilas,
Schumpeter, Burnham, and others—is trying to free the concept of
class from
its definitional
tie with private property and to apply
it
more generally to all relations of domination and subjection.
Ren-
ner's further considerations confirm
this conclusion.
His catalogue
of possible forms of domination—"stratocracy," "capitalism," "the-
ocracy," "graphocracy," "bureaucracy," etc.—is at the same time sup-
posed to be a catalogue of possible forms of class conflict.
By this modification of Marx's approach, Renner can, following
Burnham, analyze the separation of ownership and control without
assuming that
it involves the elimination of class conflict.
"Besides
the capitalist who has lost his function, there stands
.
.
.
the func-
tionary who has lost his capital
: a social character mask of great future
^® Renner makes nowhere quite clear what he means by this "method."
But his
use of the notions of a "factual substratum" and a "normative superstructure" occa-
sionally suggests that he subscribes to a considerably modified "historical materialism"
which for him probably represents the "Marxian method."

----- Page 112 (native) -----

significance" (p. 182).
Contrary to Burnham, however, Renner re-
gards the managers as "a stratum which, at least for the time being,
is politically anonymous," and for which "a general
solidarity of
interest and ideology ...
is no longer given" (p. 215).
This con-
clusion
is made possible for Renner because he regards neither the
"managerial revolution" nor the "white-collar revolution" as an iso-
lated phenomenon which
in
itself characterizes advanced industrial
society j these two social changes he consistently connects. For Renner
the emergence of a managerial stratum
is merely part of a general
development in the course of which a new class emerges—the "service
class."
Before Croner, Renner developed a kind of "theory of delega-
tion." In post-capitalist society, "the functions of capitalists appear
subdivided in a steadily growing number of salaried employees of the
very highest and of high and of lower rank.
.
.
. These new aids are
neither capitalists nor workers, they are not owners of capital, they
do not create value by their work, but they do control values created
by others"
(p. 119).
Renner calls this stratum the "service class."
It has fashioned itself on the model of public civil service and has
been transformed from a caste into a class.
Although
it participates
in authority,
it does not exercise absolute authority but
is subject to
the norms and laws of society.
There
is a further point at which Renner goes beyond Burnham
and Croner. He does not confine himself to the analysis of changes of
the ruling class j he also deals with changes in the position of the work-
ing class. By
its political and industrial achievements, the working
class has today become a constituent element of society.
"Today, the
working class is no longer that incoherent sum of helpless individuals
who are exposed to the storms of economic crises and the arbitrary
rule of rulers as the desert sand
is exposed to the elements.
It
is no
longer the proletariat of
1 848, but a powerful, confident, well-organ-
ized member of society.
It
is
this member position which gives
it
power, and often more power and security than the possession of pri-
vate wealth"
(p. 211).
By virtue of security thus guaranteed, the
wage system based on effort and output has been replaced by a "liveli-
hood system" based on needs. "Thus the working class and the service
class have moved closer together"
(p.
123).
Capital
is "controlled
by a service class which obviously amalgamates more and more with
the working class" (p. 226).
For Renner, industrial society after the disappearance of the "full
capitalist"
is characterized by two classes:
the service class and the

----- Page 113 (native) -----
Recent Theories
95
working
class.
There
still
are, of course, the "finance
capitalists,"
shareholders, and bankers, but Renner prophesies their impending
end. Thus the basic question of class analysis has to be asked anew
(p. 102), "Who or what has the real power today?" The "what" in
the formulation of this question already betrays Renner's unortho-
dox answer:
working class and service class gradually amalgamate.
Neither is really a ruling class. The ruling force
is, rather, a "some-
thing," something "objective" which Renner expresses by the notions
of "norms" or "law." "As in a democratic state the citizen does not
obey the person of the monarch but complies with the laws, as he does
not serve the official but the office as the bearer of lawful mandates,
so every employee now works according to the plan of the enterprise"
(p. 102). The "general will of society" has replaced the "rule of a
minority." "This general will defines the aim for society and thereby
for the economy, and all functionaries pass over from the service of a
master to the service of the whole. This general will is the law.
.
.
.
The exclusive rule of the law makes all forms of political illiberty
impossible. The law creates the general order.
Adaptation and sub-
ordination by law do not create a state of illiberty." Nor does the
execution of legal norms create a ruling class, for
it
is "a matter of
institutions which are organized exclusively under economic and tech-
nical aspects."
"Economic democracy supplements political democ-
racy (p. 227).
This is, of course, Rousseau versus Marx—a contest that produces
some fascinating results.
But fascinating as they
are, these results
are not, perhaps, altogether convincing. Renner does not always make
it quite clear whether his analysis refers to the present or to tendencies
of the future. Yet he is evidently not concerned with long-term pre-
dictions, much less with dreams of a classless society ä la Marx. From
the separation of ownership and control, the extension of citizenship
rights and equality, the institutionalization of class conflict, and the
emergence of the "new middle class," Renner infers the formation
of two large classes. But these are "nonantagonistic classes" or, rather,
they blend into each other and tend to amalgamate.
Renner's theory
of class structure has many traits which appear well compatible with
the changed realities of post-capitalist society and which
it will there-
fore be useful to bear in mind. But this cannot be said of the final step
and climax of Renner's analysis, the postulate of a class society with-
out class conflict.
That classes can exist without entering into violent relations of
conflict is a thesis not permitted by Marx's theory of class 5 neverthe-

----- Page 114 (native) -----

less,
it might well be correct.
It
is at least conceivable that
it corre-
sponds to observable conditions. There is no reason to contest Renner's
analysis merely because he asserts a class society without class struggle.
What we have to reject, however, is the idea of a class society without
class conflict^ because this notion
is incompatible with the heuristic
purpose of concept and theory of class.
In arriving at his conclusion,
Renner makes two significant mistakes. He confuses, first, the aspects
of integration and conflict, and, second, the levels of institutions and
norms.
Instead of applying both to all societies, he looks at capitalist
society in terms of conflict and institutions and at post-capitalist society
in terms of integration and norms.
Throughout his work, Renner
recognizes a dualism of "factual substratum" and "normative super-
structure" and considers both in any given society. Then, as he comes
to deal with the new society of the present, he suddenly forgets this
dualism and concentrates on the "normative superstructure" alone.
"Who or what has the real power today?" he asks. He answers the
"what" and neglects the "who."
In fact, Renner should have asked
in the beginning: "Who Ä«<i what have the real power today?" For
it is always its institutional structures and its values that characterize
a society—just as every society may and must be regarded from the
point of view of its unity and coherence as well as from that of
its
inherent contradictions and conflicts. By forgetting the dichotomies
of his earlier approach, Renner has been misled into an almost Stalin-
ist notion of "nonantagonistic classes" in a happily integrated society.
Yet his
is an interesting mistake which will occupy us a great deal
more in the present study.
There is an empirical point also which must be held against Ren-
ner's strange conclusion. Every society has its norms and laws, includ-
ing what might be called ruling norms and laws. Norm is a very gen-
eral category.
Its relevance for class conflicts begins only when we
ask which particular norms and laws are prevalent in a given society
and which groups or aggregates of people either tend to enjoy privi-
leges or suffer deprivations by virtue of the prevalent norms. The
statement that the rule of the capitalists has been replaced by that of
"the law" or "the general will"
is remarkably meaningless, unless
Renner wants to imply that in post-capitalist society power and
its
unequal distribution no longer exist.
If, however, this
is what he in-
tended to say, there is little evidence to support his guess. There are
many useful elements in Renner's analysis, including the assumption
of the emergence of a service class vis-a-vis the working class, but his
conclusions are disappointing in the light of general theoretical con-
siderations as well as empirical evidence.

CLASS SOCIETY IN THE MELTING-POT
(Geiger)
All authors mentioned so far insist on the possibility of describing
post-capitalist society, like its precursor, as a class society in an unmodi-
fied or restricted Marxian sense. This premise is abandoned by Gei-
ger in his study of the Class Society in the Melting-Pot (46).
For
Geiger, the old class society stands on the threshold of a new type of
order, the structure of which can no longer be adequately compre-
hended in the notion of class conflict.
Significantly, the phenomenon
of the "new middle
class"—the "experts" and "bureaucrats"—is
one of the maj or facts leading Geiger to this conclusion. Conceptually,
Geiger prepares his conclusion by distinguishing "social stratum" as
a general category from "class" as a "special case of social stratum,"
the case, namely, of a grouping "determined by the relations of pro-
duction" (p. 35).
This distinction is not purely terminological, and
we shall have to question
itj but this conceptual discussion will be
postponed for the time being in favor of empirical critique.
In any
case,
it
is easy to renounce conceptual polemics against Geiger, since
he himself has repeatedly stated his position with great clarity (20,
46, 91), and has based his considerations on a fairly precise and in-
sightful account of Marx's concept and theory of class.
Geiger's "penetrating essay" (Marshall, 95,
p.
13)
is, despite
its essayistic features and its restriction in evidence and argument, in
its plan and execution perhaps the most ambitious attempt so
far
undertaken by a sociologist to master the changed reality of advanced
industrial society in terms of a theory that
is critically inspired by
Marx.
Geiger begins his study with a fairly elaborate critical account
of Marx's concept of class and his "doctrine of the class society." He
strongly emphasizes the "dynamic" purpose of
class
analysis and
rejects objections against the model of two "dominant" classes result-
ing from this purpose as "unfounded."
There are, for him, well-
founded objections against the application of the Marxian class model
to post-capitalist society:
the pauperization of the working class has
not come true j the working class has neither become more uniform nor
grown proportionately J
the "old middle class"
is
still
in evidence
and has not become "proletarianized"; the capitalists are dying outj
class consciousness has not increased.
Before this background Geiger
develops his central
thesis.
"The Marxist model of the industrial
class society was presumably not inappropriate for the period of high
capitalism" (p. 156). But even before this class structure "was able
to penetrate the whole society, many other structural trends broke

----- Page 116 (native) -----

into the picture, deflected the stratification of 'capital and labor' and
obscured it" (p. 157). Today, we are living in a process of transition
from class "stratification"
to a new type of "stratification."
"The
transition of society from one type of stratification to another one
means
.
.
.
that hitherto subordinate lines of stratification become
dominant, and hitherto dominant ones fade into the background" (p.
153 f.).
In this sense, the class conflict based on relations of produc-
tion has given way in advanced industrial societies to certain "new
lines."
Evidently, the proof of Geiger's theories
lies in what he calls
"new lines" and, furthermore, in the method that leads him to dis-
cover these trends. Geiger proceeds cautiously and empirically. "The
class society of Marxist coloring is obviously in retreat. Nobody can
tell as yet with assurance which direction development will take. But
we can today point out a number of competing trends and, with due
caution, venture some suggestions as to the weight and force with
which these will contribute to the future formation of society"
(p.
158).
Geiger discusses in some detail
five such tendencies.
If we
neglect the
conflict between town and country (which presumably
figures so largely in Geiger's book because it was first published in and
for Denmark), four remain:
the tendency of independent political
action on the part of the "old" and "new" middle strata, that of the
increasing importance of the consumer status, that of a conflict between
all participants of production and the "mere consumers," and that of
what Geiger calls the "rule of the experts."
Geiger does not deal
with the phenomenon of social mobility.
But otherwise he explains
the majority of conflicts arising out of new developments so convinc-
ingly that one
is inclined to forgive him his unjust and superfluous
conclusion, "Thus
the
doctrine
of Karl Marx
is nothing but
the
anti-ideology corresponding to the liberal social reality of his time"
(p. 228).
Geiger's account of the four significant "new lines" of develop-
ment is not without interest for our discussion.
( i ) As to the position
of the middle strata in advanced industrial societies he notes a strange
paradox.
The "old middle stratum" of independent
artisans and
shopkeepers was engaged simultaneously in an economic struggle with
large-scale capitalism and in an ideological struggle with the prole-
tariat.
In this two-sided conflict
it
is today supported by the "new
middle stratum."
Both
resent the notion of
class structure
itself;
they fight it in the name of an estate ideology which, in Germany, led
them to support national socialism. "A class denies indignantly that

----- Page 117 (native) -----
Recent Theories
99
it is a class, and it carries on a bitter class struggle against reality and
idea of the
class struggle"
(p.
i68).
(2) The
redistribution and
equalization of income has cut through the class fronts.
Besides the
social status based on a man's "position as consumer," "the Marxian
relation of production fades" (p. 175). "Most workers have become
petty bourgeois in their purchasing power and spending habits"
(p.
176).
(3) Thanks to the "institutionalization of class conflict," the
social partners of industry have come closer to one another.
Both
derive a profit from every increase in production j
in that sense one
can "speak of a proximity of interest among capital and labor within
urban industrial society.
.
.
. The victims are those strata of society
which one could describe as mere consumers, i.e., those who have no
immediate share in the production and sale of material goods.
.
.
.
Poverty increases with the distance of an income-earner from com-
modity production"
(p. 194).
(4) Which
is the new "ruling stra-
tum"?
According to Geiger, Burnham has to some extent correctly
diagnosed a tendency of development. But his assertion of the politi-
cal rule of the economic managers
is nonsensical j
rather, "political
bureaucratism absorbs the economy itself" (p. 217). "Thus the rule
of the managers of private economy has not come about.
In a cen-
trally planned economic and social order power belongs to the eco-
nomic
officials, and
if the name bureaucracy sounds too forbidding,
one may replace it by 'rule of the experts' " (p. 220).
The empirical references of Geiger's analyses are as plausible as
most of his arguments.
But the question remains to be asked. What
is the theoretical position that has enabled Geiger to supersede Marx?
In what sense do Geiger's "new lines" provide an analysis of advanced
industrial societies that is equivalent to Marx's analysis of the capital-
ist class society?
Once again,
the answer
is disappointing.
Geiger
has not superseded Marx. His theoretical position is restricted to what
is really just the formal statement that some societies display a kind
of "stratification" different from that based on relations of produc-
tion.^^ His analysis can be condensed to the single statement that the
transition from early to advanced
industrial
societies puts hitherto
subordinate lines of "stratification" in the place of class conflict.
^^ Although Geiger always speaks of "stratification," he
is
in
fact dealing with
social conflicts.
Yet he cannot be spared the charge of having obscured the essentially
sound
distinction between "stratum" and
"class"
by
not
distinguishing
sufficientlv
stricdy the difTerent "heuristic purposes"
(this,
too, one of Geiger's concepts!)
asso-
ciated with "stratum" and "class" and by falsely subordinating that of the concept of
class to that of the concept of stratum.

Popper has described scientific theories by the metaphor of the
"searchlight." "What the searchlight makes visible will depend upon
its position, upon our way of directing it, and upon its intensity, color,
etc.
J although
it will, of course, also depend very largely upon the
things illuminated by it" (219, II, p. 260).
But always the search-
light illuminates only a sector of reality, i.e., every theory is, as such,
selective.
It guides analysis to facts which are relevant for a particu-
lar context and
excludes
others.
This
is
precisely what
Geiger's
"theory" does not achieve, and could not achieve, because
it
is not
really a theory. For this reason, Geiger's "new lines" consist in fact
of a number of barely connected descriptions concerned partly with
elements of social
conflict (mere consumers against participants of
industry), partly with changing relations of domination (rule of ex-
perts), partly simply with general social trends (consumer status).
There
is no
point
at which
these
lines converge j
they have
not
emerged in the selective beam of the searchlight of a theory but have
instead been chosen arbitrarily from the infinite number of actual lines
and trends of development.
If they are nevertheless not without
significance, this is a tribute to the good sense of a sociologist of Gei-
ger's stature. Of the two aims of his investigation Geiger has achieved
only one. He has shown that the model of a class society based on the
relations of production is no longer applicable to the analysis of post-
capitalist society. But he has not been able to show what must be sub-
stituted for this model in order to render the new society accessible
to sociological analysis.
CITIZENSHIP, EQUALITY, AND SOCIAL CLASS
(Marshall, Schelsky)
By several authors, one of Geiger's "new lines" has recently been
made the point of departure of the attempt to penetrate the changed
structure of post-capitalist society by means of sociological analysis:
the increasing equalization of the social status of incumbents of differ-
ent social positions, and in particular of the old classes.
T. H. Mar-
shall, for whom status emphasizes, in analogy to the legal meaning
of the term, "the fact that expectations (of a normative kind)
exist
in the relevant social groups" (94, p. 13), has investigated this tend-
ency at the example of the extension of the citizenship status. Accord-
ing to his theory, the main features of which we have summarized
above, the basic rights common to all citizens have been extended,
during the last two centuries, to ever new spheres of social life.
At
first, legal status lost
its differentiating force j
later, political status

lOi
followed suit J and recent social development
is characterized by a
tendency to equalize the social position of all citizens with respect to
the rights and privileges associated with this status. There are many
indications of this trend, including equality of educational and occupa-
tional opportunity, and the generalized right to a minimum income,
to sickness benefits, and to old-age pensions, etc. "The basic human
equality of membership
.
.
.
has been enriched with new substance
and invested with
a formidable array of
rights. ...
It has been
clearly identified with the status of citizenship" (57, p. 9).
Marshall
does not confine himself, however, to an account of processes of social
history, but goes on to pose the sociological problem, "Is
it still true
that basic equality, v/hen enriched in substance and embodied in the
formal rights of citizenship, is consistent with the inequalities of social
class?" (57, p. 9).
His attempt to answer this question makes Mar-
shall's analysis an essential contribution to our problem.
To all appearances, equality rights associated with citizenship and
class antagonisms are incompatible quantities.
"Citizenship is a status
bestowed on those who are full members of a community.
All who
possess the status are equal with respect to the rights and duties with
which the status
is endowed.
.
.
.
Social class, on the other hand,
is
a system of inequality. ...
It
is therefore reasonable to expect that
the impact of citizenship on social class should take the form of a con-
flict between opposing principles" (57, pp. 28 f.).
In capitalist class
society, however, this was the case only if one conceives of classes as
groups endowed with different rights and privileges that are com-
pletely closed off from each other.
For classes in the Marxian sense,
the principle of equal civil rights was, "on the contrary, necessary to
the maintenance of that particular form of inequality" (p. 33)
:
legal
equality was the basis of the (labor) contract, on which at the time
inequalities of class were founded. Even the extension of citizenship
rights to the political sphere did not seriously affect inequalities of
class.
It is only when the principle of universal basic rights is extended
to the social sphere that the existence of classes becomes problematical.
Of course, there still are inequalities.
In a way, these are even caused
by equal rights: "Through education in its relations with occupational
structure, citizenship operates as an instrument of social stratification"
(p. 67).
But in a society in which these differences are not only re-
duced to a minimum but also stripped of their ascriptive character,
they cease to be productive of conflicts.
"It may be that the inequali-
ties permitted, and even molded, by citizenship do not any longer
constitute class distinctions in the sense in which that term
is used of
past societies"
(p. 75).
In so far as class distinctions survive—and

----- Page 120 (native) -----
102
Recent Theories
Marshall seems to believe that there is a limit beyond which inequali-
ties cannot be abolished—they become "socially acceptable," lose their
"economic function," and thereby
their
force
as determinants
of
classes (see pp. 77 ff.).
In a later essay (95), Marshall has supplemented this thesis by
the assertion that classes may not have disappeared altogether, but
have changed their character:
they are no longer homogeneous inter-
est groups whose unity
is based on a common position in production
and molded by common behavior patterns and ideologies, but "asso-
ciations" formed temporarily in the occupational sphere "for the pur-
suit of
.
.
. common
interests whenever they arise and with such
degree of combination of groups as they demand" (p. 12).
Such as-
sociations are not as permanent and comprehensive as classes.
"This
might be described as a weakening of class in the Marxian sense, on
the grounds that the operative interest groups are no longer deter-
mined by the social relationship within the system of production, that
is, primarily by property" (p. 13).
Marshall refers at this point to Geiger's study.
But by contrast
to those of Geiger his theses do contain elements of a theory that might
be thought to supersede that of Marx.
Geiger has merely demon-
strated that Marx's theory of class conflict
is de facto insufficient for
the analysis of post-capitalist societies, because
it fails to account for
certain new lines of social structure.
Marshall suggests that the ex-
tension of citizenship rights has penetrated the social sphere, and that
these rights gradually lead to the elimination of all relevant inequali-
ties, so that only such "class distinctions may survive
.
.
. which have
no appropriate economic function" (57, p. 77).
If these suggestions
are correct (which
is open to dispute), then Marshall has shown that
there can be no class conflicts in the Marxian sense in advanced indus-
trial societies, because the structure of these societies
is subject to a
different law of development.
If Marshall's theses are valid, the
theory of an increasing institutionalization of an equal basic status of
all citizens represents a genuine supersedure of Marx's theory.
It
explains both why capitalist society was a class society and why there
are no classes in post-capitalist society.
Before we examine the theo-
retical and empirical basis of this theory, I shall supplement its formu-
lation by an independently developed variant which places the empha-
sis on slightly different evidence: Helmut Schelsky's thesis of the
leveling of class society.
So far, Schelsky's approach must be inferred from a number of
scattered papers
(cf.
72, 98,
164).
In one of these, he
explicitly

----- Page 121 (native) -----
Recent Theories
103
poses what he calls (72, p. 62) the "naive, but nevertheless frequently
heard question": "Have we still got a class society today?"
"Class
theory," the Marxian version of which Schelsky correctly describes
(p. 61)) as concerned with the "decisive law of development and the
dominant structure of society" was "a legitimate explanation of social
reality.
But
is
it still that?" To begin with, Schelsky replies rather
cautiously, "Sociology will not be able to answer this general question
with a plain Yes or No" (p. 62).
In so far as "something which ex-
isted once never disappears entirely in history, the question whether
today there are
still class structures has of course to be answered in
the affirmative" (p. 63). But the answer is different if we ask whether
class relations are still the dominant force in the structure and devel-
opment of advanced industrial societies.
Is, in other words, this so-
ciety still characterized by one conflict of interests towering above all
others and creating an "abyss between the classes"? "As a social scien-
tist, one would have to answer this question today clearly in the nega-
tive:
in this sense we are at present no longer a class society. Why?
Since the time which Marx had in mind, several social processes have
occurred which have leveled-in and mitigated that abyss of class ten-
sion, and at the same time new social structures and patterns have
emerged which, more than the remnants of
class conflict, must be
regarded
as the dominant
structures of contemporary
society
that
determine
its course" (p. 64).
In support of his thesis, Schelsky re-
fers to the consequences of three parallel processes:
(i)
social mo-
bility, (2) the leveling of styles of life, and (3) the inadequacy of
surviving "ideologies" for the explanation of contemporary society.
"Comprehensive and structurally far-reaching processes of up-
ward and downward
social mobility" have, according
to Schelsky,
"diminished class conflicts and leveled society into a very wide, com-
paratively uniform social stratum"
( 72, p. 64). By these processes of
mobility Schelsky seems to mean above all collective processes, such
as the "collective rise of industrial labor," the "rise of
.
.
.
salaried
employees into the new middle stratum," and the declassement par-
ticularly of the "strata of the former bourgeoisie by property and edu-
cation."
Elsewhere, however, Schelsky also refers to the increase in
the "mobility of single families,"
i.e., social mobility in the proper
sense of the sociological concept, "which has broken up collective ties
and solidarities of stratification to a large extent and has created an
egoism of small groups and families as one of the essential
social
forces of our social constitution," so that "this highly mobile society
cannot provide a lasting social status consciousness"
( 122, p. 5).

----- Page 122 (native) -----
104
Recent Theories
The growth of collective and individual mobility is accompanied
by a process of "leveling" social differences in the realm of income
and prestige and above all in patterns of behavior and styles of life.
This latter process, although emphasized also by Marshall, is central
for Schelsky's conception. One could call this new and uniform "pat-
tern of life
.
.
.
*petty bourgeois' or ^middle class,' if it were not for
the fact that these terms lead to too many misunderstandings on ac-
count of their class character" (72, p. 6$)- As a less ambiguous term
Schelsky proposes that of the "leyeled middle class society."
"This
comparative leveling of formerly class- or stratum-determined pat-
terns of behavior with respect to family life, occupational and educa-
tional aspirations of children, the functions of living, consumption
and support—indeed, of the cultural, political, and economic patterns
of reaction in general—is perhaps at present the most dominating
process in the dynamics of our modern society" (72, p. 6$).
"It ap-
pears that in place of class status the consumer position
is becoming
the central determinant of all patterns of behavior ...
so that the
negative process of leveling the class society would have to be de-
scribed positively as the emergence of the highly industrialized lei-
sure and consumer society" (pp. (>S f-)-
At first sight, the trend of social mobility—which, after all, pre-
supposes differences of position—and the leveling of styles of life
appear to contradict each other.
Indeed, "the paradox of our social
change consists in the fact that the urge to rise on the social ladder
has become universal at a time at which this ladder' has been com-
pletely abolished or at least severely shortened. By reaching an extent
that converts it into the fluid structure of society itself, social mobility
contradicts the motives of individuals which are effective in it"
(p.
71). For this reason a sort of "false self-consciousness" emerges or,
as Schelsky calls it, a "constitutional irreality of social self-conscious-
ness" (98, p. 4)
: because other explanations are lacking, men experi-
ence society in categories which no longer hold. The need for security
effects the "retention of antiquated notions of social status inherited
from class or estate society" ( 72, p. 71).
Schelsky does not assert that in advanced industrial societies there
are no tensions or conflicts j indeed, he strongly objects to what he calls
a "Utopian 'bourgeois' idea or hope of social harmony" (p. 66)
. How-
ever, the tensions peculiar to the new society are no longer class con-
flicts. They are, rather, typically tensions "between the abstract orders
of society and little primary groups" (231, p. 350), conflicts "of the
individual or the immediate 'We' with the anonymous system of every

----- Page 123 (native) -----

105
kind of bureaucracy, on which one depends and by which one feels
controlled, and even exploited"
(72,
p.
67).
Elsewhere Schelsky
claims in almost literal agreement with Marshall that "the conflict
of organized representations of interests" has "replaced the conflict
of the large, diffuse blocs of classes" (p. 68).
This summary gives a rough outline of a kind of social theory the
influence of which seems to grow steadily today in sociology as well as
in public opinion. Marshall has formulated it in terms of an analysis
of English social development, Schelsky with reference to (West)
German society. We shall presently turn to American studies which
resemble those of Marshall and Schelsky in many points.
Thus
it
seems permissible to infer that a conception claims validity for all
advanced industrial societies when its main arguments are as follows:
( I ) the dynamics of post-capitalist society can no longer reasonably
be described by a Marxian notion of class conflict j (2) the equalization
of basic rights, conditions of life, and patterns of behavior has re-
moved the basis of class differentiation j (3) moreover, an extraordi-
nary intensification of social mobility makes the formation of lasting
solidary groups impossible j
(4) the (Marxian) theory of class has
therefore lost its value as an instrument of explanation and must be
replaced by a fundamentally different theory of social tensions on the
basis of equal positions and situations.
It will now be our task to con-
sider whether these theses, and especially the second and the third of
them, stand up to a critical examination in the light of empirical evi-
dence.
It can indeed be shown, as has been indicated in the previous chap-
ter, that a certain equalization of aspects of the situation of various
social groups has taken place in the course of social development dur-
ing the past century. Marshall and Schelsky plausibly emphasize two
aspects of this development:
the extension of equal basic rights and
the leveling of differences of social status. On the other hand, there
can be no doubt that this egalitarian trend has by no means advanced
to the point of equality.
It is certainly true that equal opportunity of
education and upward mobility is a characteristic value orientation of
industrial societies.
But has this principle been realized yet?
As D.
V. Glass summarizes an empirical investigation, "Though between
the two World Wars there was an unprecedented expansion in the op-
portunities for secondary and university education, the discrepancies
in educational opportunity as between individuals of different social
origins had by no means been eliminated" (107, p. 16).
The same holds for Germany, the United States, and other socie-

----- Page 124 (native) -----

ties on a similar level of development. Even today legal and political
citizenship rights are often restricted by social deprivations and disad-
vantages. The right to proceed against others is of little moment for
him who has not got the money to loose his case or even engage a
lawyer.
Differences not only of income and prestige, but also of the
"consumer position" are even more apparent. The "comforts of civili-
zation" are still distributed quite unequally, at least in the European
countries
to which
Marshall's and
Schelsky's
analyses
refer.
Al-
though
in 1955
nine out of ten German households possessed an
electric iron, only one out of ten had a washing machine or a refrig-
erator, and only two out of ten a motor vehicle (229, pp. 27 f.). Al-
though the cinema is open to everybody in his leisure time, there are
considerable differences between those who make use of this possibility
quite regularly (Germany, 1955: 46 per cent), rarely (30 per cent),
or never (24 per cent).
Although almost everybody listens to the
radio (Germany, 1955: 92 per cent), not everybody listens to the
same programs (cf . 229, pp. 59, 62, 67, etc.)
. Of course, neither Mar-
shall nor Schelsky claimed that "equality" or "leveling" are as yet
completely realized; both refer to "tendencies" of social develop-
ment; but, trivial as
it may sound,
it
is necessary to emphasize time
and again that so far the realization of these tendencies
is extremely
incomplete, and that the empirical validity of any theory based on
these tendencies alone is therefore severely restricted. We have raised
the question before, whether there might not be structural limits be-
yond which the leveling of status symbols, rights, and situations can-
not advance.
It may well be that Marshall and Schelsky have been
too fascinated with the leveling of traditional statuses and status sym-
bols to realize that new, more subtle criteria are already taking their
place.
^*
However, this kind of objection in terms of empirical evidence
cannot as such be regarded as a refutation of Marshall's and Schelsky's
theories. There is no point in disputing the existence of leveling ele-
ments of social status in modern societies. The really important ques-
tions which we have to ask are of a different order: which spheres
have been affected by this tendency?
Are there any areas of social
structure in which a tendency of this kind
is not discernible?
If we
examine the theories of Marshall and Schelsky from the point of view
of these questions, a peculiar fact becomes apparent.
Schelsky's claim
^®
I am thinking here of makes of cars, kinds of leisure time activity, patterns of
participation in culture, etc., in the sphere of statuses and their symbols, and of merely
customary privileges of attendance and belongingness in the sphere of rights.

----- Page 125 (native) -----
Recent Theories
107
of a tendency of leveling statuses, styles of life, and patterns of be-
havior indicates above all a factual assimilation of status differences
and their symbols.
Marshall's notion of equal citizenship rights em-
phasizes beyond that a shrinking of the sphere of possible social dif-
ferences and, thereby, a lessening of possible sources of conflict. Both
tendencies have certain obvious consequences for class conflict, in par-
ticular for the substance of the opposing interests.
But both tenden-
cies leave entirely untouched one problem which
is of crucial impor-
tance for Marx's as for any other theory of class, namely, the problem
of power or authority and its social distribution.
Earlier we found that with respect to the social distribution of
positions invested with authority a leveling tendency is hard to imag-
ine and has certainly not occurred in modern societies.
Probably, dif-
ferences of legitimate authority are a basic fact of social structure j in
any case, they are a fact systematically overlooked by Marshall and
Schelsky.
Their theories do not contain an answer to the problem of
the position of the manager or bureaucrat, and, what
is more, this
problem is not even raised. The theory of leveling does not supersede
Marx's theory of class but redirects analysis to different problems and
different aspects of social structure on the silent or explicit assumption
that in advanced industrial societies these aspects are in some sense
more important and more dominating. Why they should be more im-
portant, and above all why the distribution of authority should no
longer be important—these are questions
to which Marshall and
Schelsky give no answer. For them, turning away from the problem
of power is a thematic decision and not a result of analysis. The theory
of leveling may not be wrong; but
it
is ultimately simply irrelevant
for the problem of class.
It deals with a different subject, that of
social
stratification, and
it becomes objectionable, therefore,
if the
misleading attempt
is made to pretend that
it supersedes Marx or
represents a comprehensive account of the dynamics of post-capitalist
society."
This objection of ours requires one slight modification.
As we
have seen, Marshall and Schelsky do not deny the existence of con-
flicts and
tensions
in
post-capitalist
society.
Schelsky
in
particular
^^ Marshall and Schelsky can be accused of
illegitimately applying
a theory of
social stratification to class analysis only in so far as both imfUcitly pass bv the proper
area of class analysis.
But this charge applies in full to some authors who have recently
tried to prove that contemporary Western society
is
classless, whereas Eastern societv
is a quasi-capitalist class society, and who have developed this argument by using two
entirely different conceptual schemes for these two types of social order.

speaks of the "bureaucracy, on which one depends and by which one
feels controlled, and even exploited."
Elsewhere he refers to the
"rule of the managers" (164) and even abandons the term "leveled
middle-class
society"
in favor of
"industrial-bureaucratic society"
( 1 63, pp. 275 ff.)
. But these conflicts and tensions have no systematic
place in his theory.
If one excludes the problem of power and au-
thority from social analysis, one abandons the possibility to trace social
conflicts back to structural conditions. They become essentially random
phenomena, carried on by unpredictable chance groupings and related
to fundamentally uncertain issues.
For this is precisely what Marx's
theory had achieved: to demonstrate the structural determinateness
of social conflicts. An approach that throws overboard the intention
and formal achievement of a theory with its particular, if empirically
refuted, formulation does not supersede this theory but withdraws
a sphere of knowledge from science in order to hand
it over to the
randomness of arbitrary opinion.
Thus the theory under discussion is by no means what it purports
to be, a supersedure of Marx's theory of class.
Yet there is one ele-
ment of
it, the relevance of which for the problem of class we have
to examine briefly.
Marshall and particularly Schelsky place great
emphasis on the phenomenon of social mobility in the sense of individ-
ual movements up and down the status scale within and between gen-
erations. Schelsky asserts that mobility has become "the fluid structure
of society itself" and "has broken up collective ties and solidarities
of stratification to a large extent." This assertion implies the hypoth-
esis that classes lose their raison d^etre in a society in which belonging-
ness to all nonprimary groupings assumes a merely temporary charac-
ter. We shall have to return to this complex problem repeatedly. But
the hypothesis of the impossibility of class formation in highly mobile
societies contain an error which must be exposed at this point.
In analyzing social structures of entire societies or individual insti-
tutions, associations, and groups, a clear distinction
is necessary be-
tween social positions or roles and their agglomerations on the one
hand, and the personnel of these units, the incumbents of such posi-
tions, on the other hand.
Social mobility constitutes in the first place
a type of recruitment of the personnel of given
positions.
Social
classes, however, are phenomena which at least potentially exist inde-
pendent of the mode of recruitment and rate of fluctuation of their
members. An industrial enterprise does not cease to exist if the annual
rate of turnover of
its workers amounts to lOO per cent or even 200

----- Page 127 (native) -----

109
per cent and more.
In this sense, the degree of social mobility is as
such irrelevant to the problem of the existence of classes.
"Every
class," Schumpeter remarks with a plausible metaphor, "resembles
for the duration of its collective life ...
a hotel or a bus which
is
always occupied, but always by different people" (27, p. 171).
It is
therefore false to assume that social classes and social mobility are
as such incompatible. This is not to say, of course, that the increasing
institutionalization of upward and downward mobility does not re-
quire certain modifications of the theory of class.
THE NEW SOCIETY
(Drucker, Mayo)
It might appear strange if we conclude this survey of some recent
theories of class conflict with a discussion of the work of two sociolo-
gists in the analyses of whom the concept of class plays no part at all.^°
Yet there is a certain logic in the sequence of theories discussed in this
chapter. We began with a conception which at least pretends to be
based on a strictly Marxian model. The theories of Djilas, Schum-
peter, Burnham, Croner, and Renner involve increasingly consequen-
tial modifications of Marx's approach. From these modifications it is
only a
step
to Geiger's
thesis
that
class structures have
lost
their
dominant
character, and further
to Marshall's and
Schelsky's
as-
sumption of the leveling of inequalities in post-capitalist society. The
analyses of Drucker and Mayo—which, more than the others, may
be regarded as arbitrarily selected examples for a widespread con-
ception—perfect this line of analytical development by v/orking with
entirely different categories.
The problem of
class
conflict was at
J east touched upon by all other authors mentioned
in
this survey j
for Drucker and Mayo
it no longer seems to exist. We shall have
to find out what Drucker and Mayo have
to
offer instead of the
Marxian theory of class, in so far as they deal with this aspect of
social structure at
all.
The books by Drucker (144) and Mayo (154) with which we
are here concerned have many features in common.
Both authors
believe—like Burnham and Croner—that modern
social develop-
ment involved a "revolution." "The world revolution of our time
^° Both authors occasionally use the word "class" in the sense of "stratum." Even
tJiis is rare, however, and furthermore
it remains without the slightest analytical signifi-
cance for the theories of Drucker and Mayo.

.
. The true revolutionary principle
is the idea
of mass-production" (Drucker, p.
i).
For both authors the indus-
trial enterprise of production
is "the decisive, the representative and
the constitutive institution" of the new order (Drucker, p. 27). Both
have similar names for this "new order": "industrial order," "indus-
trial society" (Drucker), "industrial civilization," "modern industrial
society" (Mayo). However, neither for Drucker nor for Mayo are
these categories mere sociological concepts j
rather, they indicate
a
model in the sense of a desirable ideal. Thus both authors share an
inclination to profess values and social policies which cuts through
their analyses of reality at many points.
Drucker's and Mayo's line of argument—neither of them likes
the term "theory," because they identify
it with practical uselessness,
and thus we shall refrain from applying
it
to their conceptions
can be summarized
in
three main
points.
First,
they begin
their
analyses with the model of an industrial society.
Cooperation of in-
dividuals and groups is the supreme principle of such a society.
It
is
"a general principle for organizing people to work together" (Druck-
er, p. 3), "a balanced relation between various parts of the organi-
zation, so that the avowed purpose for which the whole exists may
be conveniently and continuously fulfilled" (Mayo,
p. 45).
The
structure of this society does not generate any conflicts that cannot
be completely solved j in it, "split allegiance" is converted into "twin
allegiance" (Drucker, pp. 146 f.), and a "common interest" combines
all (Mayo, p. 127).
There still are different group interests, even
certain conflicts—an aspect emphasized rather more by Drucker than
by Mayo—but their elimination
is merely a matter of "intelligent
organization
that
takes careful account of
all
the group
interests
involved" (Mayo, p.
128).
"The proper study of mankind
is or-
ganization" (Drucker, p. 263).
Second, both Drucker and Mayo admit that industrial societies
were in an early stage, before the "revolution of mass-production,"
far removed from this model.
Capitalist society had marked elements
of a closed (Mayo: "established," Drucker: "traditional")
society,
dominated by permanent
(class)
conflicts, "a confused struggle of
pressure groups, power blocs" (Mayo,
p.
7), and many other dis-
turbances. A number of historical trends have already largely abol-
ished this state of affairs. Drucker mentions the separation of owner-
ship and control, the emergence of the "new middle class," the level-
ing of status, the extension of citizenship
rights, the
institutionali-

zation of class conflict.
But as yet the model—an ideal for both, but
a realizable ideal—has not been realized properly.
One element
is
stilJ lacking, the absence of which at the same time explains all dis-
turbances and conflicts of industrial societies to the present dayj and
this element is psychological in nature.
For, third, the central
thesis which overshadows
all other con-
siderations for Mayo, but
is
little less important for Drucker, can
be summarized
in the statement that
conflicts and tensions such
as
those which class analysis is supposed to explain constitute but a "de-
viation" from a normal
state of human attitudes and actions, and
can and must therefore be eliminated by "education." Mayo thinks
that "Marx detested *the bourgeoisie' on grounds that will some day
probably be shown to have been personal" (p. 120). The same holds
for the labor leaders whom Mayo encountered.
"These men had no
friends.
.
.
.
They had no capacity for conversation.
.
.
.
They
regarded the world as a hostile place. ...
In every instance the
personal history was one of social privation—a childhood devoid of
normal and happy association in work and play with other children"
(p. 24).
Thus, class conflict was but a relapse into barbarian condi-
tions, an expression of human imperfections, and
it
is necessary to
render it impossible by the formation of "social skills," i.e., the edu-
cation of cooperative and peace-loving men. "Where cooperation
is
maintained between the individual and his group, the group and the
union, the union and management, the personal sense of security and
absence of discontent in the individual run high" (p. 128).
Drucker,
who, by contrast with Mayo,
is not a university professor,
is a little
more careful
in
his formulations.
But he, too, works with Mayo's
concept of "social skills"
(p. 23);
for him, too,
social
conflict and
its elimination
is
largely
a matter
of "managerial
attitude"
(pp.
158 ff.), a problem of "communication" and mutual understanding
(pp.
191
ff.).
"The individual" must obtain "status and function
in the industrial enterprise"
(p.
165), must learn to understand
its
goals and purposes as his goals and purposes, and must be induced
to "responsible participation as a citizen" (p. 156) for the "industrial
order" to function properly. What Drucker calls "integration" and
Mayo "cooperation"
is based for both "on understanding and the
will to work together rather than on force" (Mayo, p. 115).
The "right attitude" of individuals, or "force"—an intermediate
reality, such as social structure, does not exist at all for Mayo and
evaporates for Drucker wherever its patterns might disturb his policy

recommendations.
But
I shall refrain here from a comprehensive
critique of the conceptions of Drucker and Mayo, and those who fol-
lowed them.^^
Instead,
I
shall confine myself to those aspects of
this conception the
critical examination of which may advance my
own investigation. The first question will therefore have to be. Does
this "conception"
contain a theory which
at any point
affects the
problem of class conflict in industrial societies?
The answer to this
question depends on how strict a concept of theory we employ.
Expressed in a formula,
it
is Drucker's and Mayo's thesis that
the class conflict of capitalist society was an (almost psychological)
phenomenon of "deviance" from a normal state of integration and
cooperation.
Post-capitalist society tends toward this "normal state,"
although a number of educational measures are still required to bring
it about. This thesis barely conceals a value judgment j
it is not really
a hypothesis that permits of empirical
test, but a philosophical ob-
servation about the immanent goal of social history or, more likely,
an expression of certain
political aims and
desires.
In either case
I should hesitate to call this conception a theory. But if not a theory,
something else is implied by Drucker's and Mayors conception which
justifies its discussion here.
It is based on a notion of society which
Mayo makes explicit when he says, "A society
is a cooperative sys-
tem" (p. 115). The two essential ingredients of this notion are the
assumptions that social conflict is not an essential and necessary feature
of social structure, and that the variables which explain conflict, and
consequently "order" and "integration," are psychological in nature.
This basic theoretical
attitude, from which a variety of analytical
consequences follow, is by no means confined to Drucker and Mayo.
In fact it dominates, if in sometimes rather more complex and subtle
forms, much of contemporary American sociology, including the work
of
its most eminent theorist, Talcott Parsons.
If, however, a basic
attitude of this type proves sensible, then there is indeed no point in
a theory of class conflict, and we should have to search for new tools
of analysis.
It
is
difficult
to examine "basic attitudes" of
scientific analysis
with respect to their usefulness. The question of empirical rightness
or wrongness does not apply to them. That "society is a cooperative
system"
is a statement which can neither be confirmed nor refuted
by empirical propositions. We are dealing here with "meta-theoreti-

which see as the most recent, and best, example the essay by H. L. Sheppard (87).

113
cal"^^ decisions which determine the direction of analysis with respect
to specific problems without being part of this analysis themselves.
Their test is their analytical fruitfulness and not their empirical cor-
rectness or logical soundness. We have to ask whether an image of
society as an integrated system
in which
destructive
conflicts occur
only as deviations of a psychological nature from a normal state of
order can be an appropriate background for the analysis of sociologi-
cal problems.
It is one of the themes of this study to reject and super-
sede this image of society, and the works of Drucker and Mayo pro-
vide a welcome opportunity to substantiate the point of view which
underlies our considerations.
If
it
is true that we have to regard society as an integrated "co-
operative system," and that deviations from
this integration must
be explained in terms of psychological variables, it would follow, for
example, that
all socialists in a capitalist society are
in some sense
psychologically deficient, that they are "deviants." Mayo has seen
this extreme implication; he
tries therefore to explain the work of
Marx as well as the actions of the labor leaders he met by reference
to their "case history." There is little doubt that some recent studies
of social psychologists with
their attempt of a correlation between
political attitudes and personality types" have lent themselves to the
support of this conclusion. However, the hypothesis seems reasonable
and has not so far been refuted, that there
is no significant corre-
lation between, say, a voting decision for a conservative or progressive
party and neurotic dispositions.
Moreover, even if there was such a
correlation, one would have to find out whether its causes are purely
a matter of individual history or of social conditions.
For this
is the
image of society which we want to oppose to that of Drucker and
Mayo:
that
societies create out of
their structure with
predictable
certainty the
conditions of
social antagonisms, and
that
therefore
society is not an integrated cooperative system but at best a relatively
integrated system of conflicting structural forces, even more, a per-
manently changing structure of integrative and disruptive factors.
^^ An expression which in
its specific meaning intended here
I have taken from
an unpublished
essay of U. Torgersen
(Oslo), and which indeed seems
a
plausible
description of attitudes that guide empirical research without themselves permitting
of empirical
test.
-^
I am referring here, e.g., to research on the subject of "authoritarian person-
alities" and on
national,
political, and ethnic stereotypes.
It would seem
to be an
important task of scientific criticism
to examine such studies from the point of view
here advanced and to ask in what sense their very design excludes the assumption of
conflicts generated by social structure.

----- Page 132 (native) -----
114
Recent Theories
Another extreme implication of the integration image of society
is that "social problems" can
in principle be solved only by
influ-
encing, "improving," and "normalizing" individuals.
Elton Mayo
has realized this implication, too, both in theory and in practice, in
the context of the Hawthorne experiment in the
I920^s and early
1930's. But it seems to me that H. L. Sheppard was right in accusing
Mayo of systematically underestimating "economic and political de-
terminants" and problems of the distribution of power, and of re-
ducing all conflicts to "person-to-person relations" (87, p. 327).
In
so far as refutation
is possible here,
it appears sufficient to recall the
causes and consequences of numerous institutional changes of recent
social development in the spheres of economy, state, education,
etc.
It
is neither possible nor perhaps desirable to arrive
at a final
decision about which image of society
is "better" or "more correct."
But examples such as those mentioned here suggest that we reject
the integration model as insufficient and deal with problems of con-
flict on the basis of a different, more appropriate model.
According
to this new model, conflict is an essential element of the structure of
every society.
It grows out of this structure and can be eliminated
only very temporarily, and only by structural changes. The carriers
of conflict are of course individuals, but these only in so far as the
impact of their action
is directed by structural conditions to larger
aggregates
of
individuals.
Psychological
factors
are
a
secondary
characteristic, not the cause of social
conflict.
Society
is process;
its
order lies solely in the lawfulness of its change.
It would not have been difficult to expose the insufficiencies and
defects of Drucker's and Mayors analyses on the level of empirical
criticism.
But the deepest shortcoming of their works and those of
others becomes apparent only
if we examine their meta-theoretical
conception of society.
If Drucker and Mayo are right, then not only
are there no classes, but there never have been such systematic con-
flict groups in history. The phenomenon of structural conflict itself
loses its reality and, indeed, its potentiality.
However, the theorists
of integration would find
it hard to hold on to this assertion in their
analyses. There are too many problems for which
it fails to account,
and we shall therefore be well advised to operate with a more dynamic
image of society.
UNSOLVED PROBLEMS
None of the theoretical approaches of modern sociology which
we have examined in this chapter appears to provide an entirely satis-

115
factory solution of our problem.
Although every one of them tries
to incorporate one or another element of the new reality of an ad-
vanced industrial society as
it emerged since Marx's time, although
therefore all of them go beyond the Marxian theory of class, none
of them succeeds in superseding Marx's theory by a new and simi-
larly comprehensive formulation. Four main reasons for this failure
have emerged.
( i ) Some sociologists confine themselves to demon-
strating that Marx's predictions have not come true and that, there-
fore, his theory has not been confirmed.
If they indicate certain "new
lines," as Geiger does, these remain unconnected and merely confirm
the uselessness of Marx's theory without replacing
it by a new ap-
proach.
(2) The trend of sociological analysis founded on meta-
theoretical assumptions that deny the possibility of analyzing social
conflict as a structural phenomenon intrinsically rejects, of course, the
very idea of a theory to replace Marx's.
Thus,
for Drucker and
Mayo there
is no point
in any theory of
conflict,
since systematic
antagonisms have no place in their image of society.
(3) Some promi-
nent sociological theories of post-capitalist society remove the subject
matter of analysis to aspects of social structure other than those dealt
with by Marx in his class theory.
For this reason T. H. Marshall's
and H. Schelsky's contributions remain marginal to our problem and
cannot be considered
as superseding the old theory.
(4)
Finally,
there are some theoretical approaches which retain the heuristic in-
tention of Marx's theory but
fail to account for more than one or
two changes that have occurred
since.
Thus Burnham's
thesis
is,
contrary to the claim of
its author, in fact confined to the realm of
industrial production and ignores problems of political structure as
well as changes in the skill structure of labor, the institutionalization
of class conflict, etc.
Djilas restricts himself to the analysis of con-
temporary Communist
societies,
and
his model
cannot
easily
be
applied to other countries.
Renner's approach
is, even apart from its
untenable
conclusion, merely an
indication
that wants
elaboration
and completion.
Without doubt, every one of the theories discussed in this chapter
contributes something to our knowledge of contemporary society and,
more particularly, to our understanding of social conflict in post-capi-
talist societies. But with respect to the precise formulation of a theory
of social class or
its equivalent, we can learn more from their weak-
nesses and mistakes than from their substance. Our problem
is the
explanation of systematic
social
conflicts
in
industrial
societies.
In
order to solve this problem, we shall have to find a formulation that

----- Page 134 (native) -----
1 1
Recent Theories
passes beyond the mere statement of facts.
It appears advisable to
base this formulation on an image of society that permits the expla-
nation of conflicts in terms of structural, not individual, conditions.
For the theory to be useful, it will be necessary to define with utmost
precision the area of problems for which
it holds and for which
it
does not hold.
Finally, the theory will have to be capable of account-
ing for the society with which Marx was concerned as well as for
contemporary society and for the changes that have transformed the
former into the latter.

A Sociological Critique of Marx
SOCIOLOGY AND THE WORK OF MARX
"The relation of succeeding generations to the phenomenon of
class society has been determined," or so Geiger thinks, "to the present
day by the doctrine of Marx" (46, p.
10).
Lipset and Bendix are
of the opposite opinion: "The study of social classes has suffered in
the past from the proclivity of social scientists to react against the
influence of Karl Marx" (55, p. 151). There is probably an element
of truth
in both of these statements.
Only too long has discussion
in social science been dominated by the attempt either to reject the
doctrine of Marx altogether or to sustain
it without qualification/
Implicitly,
if not explicitly, this attempt underlies the endless dis-
putes about "what Marx really meant" (as G. D. H. Cole called one
of his books).
It is not difficult to see why this has happened. There
is, for one thing, the political attractiveness, or repulsiveness, as the
case may be, of Marx's work j there is, secondly, the prophetical prom-
ise of his predictions 5 and there is, above all, what Schumpeter called
the "imposing synthesis" of Marx's
doctrine.
"Our time
revolts
against the inexorable necessity of specialization and therefore cries
out for synthesis, nowhere more loudly than in the social sciences, in
which the nonprofessional element counts for so much.
But," Schum-
peter adds with equal right at this point, "Marx's system illustrates
well that, though synthesis may mean new light,
it also means new
fetters" (73, p. 45).
Schumpeter does not hesitate to free himself
and his discipline, economics, from these fetters at the expense of
the "imposing synthesis."
In this we shall have to follow him for
sociology.
To ignore Marx is convenient, but
it
is also naive and irrespon-
^ And the two statements quoted bear witness not only to opposing attitudes
to
be found among sociologists in general, but in particular to the differences in approach
between European and American sociologists. To the present day the reaction against
Marx (often coupled with complete ignorance of his work)
is
as widespread
in the
United States as the uncritical acceptance of Marx's theories in Europe.

sible. No physicist — if this analogy be pardoned — would ignore
Einstein because he does not approve of his political attitude or of
some aspects of his theories. To accept Marx toto coelo may testify
to an honorable faithfulness but is scientifically fruitless and danger-
ous. No physicist would abstain from attacking Einstein just because
he happened to like the man and his work as a whole. We have started
our investigation with an examination of the work of Marx, because
his formulation of class theory is both the first and, as we know now,
the only one of its kind. Today this theory is refuted, but it has not
been superseded. Now we have to draw from Marx what is still use-
ful, or, more precisely, we have to separate the problem of class theory
from Marx^s class theory itself. We are concerned with the theory of
class as a sociological instrument j from this point of view, the Marx-
ian theory of class is in principle a matter of indifference, i.e., it inter-
ests us only as a historical background or an object of critique.
At an early point, we have distinguished Marx's "philosophy"
from his "sociology."
In doing this we have not meant, of course, to
sustain Marx's "sociology" in its entirety.
In an empirical discipline,
that kind of intention can only lead to disaster. We shall now go about
the business of dissecting Marx's "sociology," of sustaining what
is
useful in his approach and rejecting what is useless. There is no place
for sentimental regard or even undue respect in a critical process of this
kind.
If, for example, the exclusive connection of the concept of class
with economic conditions or structures
("relations of production")
should turn out to be a "fetter," a useless assumption,
it must be re-
jected, no matter what Marx said, meant, or wanted.
If, conversely,
certain elements of Marx's theory of class formation stand up to the
test of empirical evidence, they must be sustained j but, again, it is es-
sentially a matter of indifference that
it was Marx who formulated
these elements.
The charge of eclecticism might be leveled against a procedure of
this kind.
If this is so, the notion of eclecticism is used with some jus-
tice, but it does not constitute a charge.
Eclecticism may be considered
a sin in philosophy, but science is essentially eclectic.
In fact, a scientist
who is not as such an eclectic is no scientist or at least a bad one. The
unqualified acceptance of a "doctrine"—dogmatism—is the cardinal
sin of science.
The unbiased reader may grow weary of so many words about so
obvious a matter, but unfortunately they are, in the case of Marx, still
necessary.
There
still
are many who do not see that the epithets
"Marxist" or "anti-Marxist" have no meaning and place in a science.

----- Page 137 (native) -----
Sociological Critique of Marx
119
In fact, this is not the least reason why the vast literature about the
subject of class (or at least about the word "class'*) has brought so
little real advance.
It appears as if sociology has hardly progressed
at all in this respect since Marx—surely an astonishing fact in view of
its extraordinary development in other fields!
However, it would be false to say that the attempt to reformulate
the theory of class is entirely lacking in precedents and points of con-
tact in recent sociology. We shall have opportunity to refer to numer-
ous connections and suggestions in the course of our considerations.
Without injuring the originality and individuality of the scholars con-
cerned, one might even construct a certain convergence of the concep-
tual and theoretical discussion of class in recent sociology. The works
of Schumpeter, Renner, Geiger, Lipset, Bendix, and even Parsons
mark some of the milestones on this road towards a sociological theory
of conflict in industrial societies. Other contributions will be added to
this list as we go along. Thus the present investigation does not claim
particular
originality
(which
in any case
is a dangerous virtue
in
scholarship).
It is rather an attempt to connect many loose threads
into a net with which we can "catch" an important sector of social
reality.
In the present chapter we shall be concerned with elucidating the
prerequisites of the fruitful use of something like a concept and theory
of class in sociological analysis. Although we shall in every case build
our discussion around a critical examination of Marx's position, our
assumptions
will
increasingly depart from those of Marx and
his
theory of class. Having ascertained the conditions and main categories
of a class theory of social conflict, we can then proceed (in the follow-
ing two chapters) to an attempt to outline the main features of this
theory.
In the last two chapters of this study the analytical usefulness
of the reformulated theory of class conflict will be subjected to a test
by its application to the structure of post-capitalist societies.
SOCIAL STRUCTURE AND SOCIAL CHANGE:
MARX SUSTAINED
In the last decades, considerable progress has been made in the
development of a theoretical instrumentarium for analyzing the struc-
ture of total societies and their parts. The credit for codifying the ele-
ments of this analysis
is principally due to American sociologists, al-
though their most eminent representative, Talcott Parsons, has rightly
referred (see 216) to earlier impulses in the work of the Englishman
Alfred Marshall, the Frenchman Emile Durkheim, the Italian Vil-
fredo Pareto, and the German Max Weber.
It is too early yet to speak

----- Page 138 (native) -----
120
Sociological Critique of Marx
of a complete theory that is at our disposal in structural analysis j all
we have
is a theoretical instrumentarium. The notions of a "func-
tional" or "structural-functional theory" are in many ways premature,
if one does not want to extend the term "theory" beyond
its
strict
meaning.
These notions refer to what is above all a set of intercon-
nected categories (partly linked by generalizing assumptions), whose
application to empirical problems permits the general description of
social structures as well as the determination of the place of specific
elements
in
them.
Societies and organized
units within
societies
(groups, associations, institutions)^ have a structure or can be regarded
as units displaying a structure. "To exhibit the structure of an object
is to mention its parts and the ways in which they are interrelated.
.
.
.
Every account of structure is relative to certain units which are, for the
time being, treated as if they were devoid of structure, but
it must
never be assumed that these units will not, in another context, have a
structure which
it is important to recognize" (Russell, 222, pp. 267,
269).
The basic unit of structural
analysis
in sociology
to which
this statement obviously applies, is that of role,
i.e., of a complex of
behavior expectations which are associated with a given social position
or status.
In structural analysis, the human individual in the fullness
of his expressions figures only as an incumbent of such positions, and
"player" of roles.
The relations between roles and their agglom-
erations around certain institutional spheres
(occupation, education,
family, politics, etc.) are expressed by the concept of function, i.e., by
their latent or manifest consequences for the "functioning" of the
total structure.
Thus, the structure of a society presents itself in
its
most formal aspect as a functional system the units of which are social
roles and role sets.^
But by contrast with the structure of other objects of knowledge,
especially of organisms with which they are frequently compared, so-
cial structures have one important peculiarity. They are not as such
"given," they cannot in principle be analyzed independent of their
^ "Structural-functional"
theorists
like
to
refer
to both with
the term
"social
system."
Reasonable as this link by
a general category
is,
it
is nevertheless dangerous
because of the possible implications of the concept of system from the point of view
of conflict and change: systems might appear as closed
units which do not permit of
change.
This
is,
to be sure, a misunderstanding; but
in order to
forestall
it
I would
propose to avoid the term "system."
^
I neither intend nor can attempt here
to give even the
barest outline of the
categories and assumptions of the "structural-functional" approach.
For that, see the
works of Parsons, Merton, Levy, and others; see also my essay on Parsons (206). Here
we are concerned merely with certain formal aspects of this approach, in so far as they
are relevant for the theory of class.

historical
context,
but they
are themselves
subject
to
continuous
change. By change in this sense we do not mean the occurrence of cer-
tain processes within a given structural pattern, for this is accounted
for by the category of structure in any case. Regular processes within
objects that have a structure—such as the processes of role allocation,
or of the socialization of new members of society—are indeed an es-
sential element of every structure j structural analysis is essentially the
analysis of such processes. What is meant here is, rather, that the en-
tire structural arrangement of so-called forms of society can change.
Function and functional importance of the heart or liver in an organ-
ism do not change ; function and functional importance of religious or
economic institutions in society not only can change but also are subject
to a continuous process of change in all known societies. The function-
ing of medieval European society would evidently be strongly en-
dangered if in an experiment of imagination we removed all religious
institutions from this society ; were we, however, to remove these insti-
tutions from today's secularized industrial societies the effect would
be considerably milder. An analogous argument could not be made
for organisms.
Should we remove the heart from the human organ-
ism, the consequences would be the same at all times. Radcliffe-Brown
has realized
this peculiarity of social structures more clearly than
many of the later "structural-functionalists" when he states, "that an
animal organism does not, in the course of its life, change its structural
type. A pig does not become a hippopotamus.
.
.
. On the other
hand a society in the course of its history can and does change its struc-
tural type without any breach of continuity" (220, p. 181).
Russell remarks in his logical analysis of the concept of structure,
"An analysis of structure, however complete, does not tell you
all
that you may wish to know about an object.
It tells you only what are
the parts of the object and how they are related to each other 5
it tells
you nothing about the relations of the object to objects that are not
parts or components of it" (222, p. 268).
In the case of organic struc-
tures, this involves a limitation of structural analysis, not an objection
against it. Anatomy and physiology have heuristic value and scientific
validity even without a social psychology of relations between organ-
isms.
Social structures, however, carry within them the seed of other
structures that lie beyond their (fictitious) borderlines. They reach,
so to speak, beyond themselves j at any given point of time they either
are no longer or not yet what they appear to be.
Process and change
are their very nature and indicate therefore superordinate categories
of analysis.
Although
in biology the analysis of the evolutionary
process can rest on structural analysis, such analysis must, in sociology.

----- Page 140 (native) -----
122

be subordinated to the analysis of processes of change of structural
patterns.
Time and again, structural-functional theory has been accused of
not recognizing this basic fact of social reality. With respect to the
intention of most of its advocates at least, this accusation is unjustified.
Not merely, but especially, in sociology the analysis of changes of
structural patterns creates almost insuperable problems. "We reason
about movement," so Bergson laments on behalf of philosophy, "as
if it were composed of immobilities, and if we consider it, we compose
it of immobilities. Movement for us is a position"—such as a struc-
ture—"and then a new position, etc., ad infinitum^* (223, p.
165).
The statement is justified, but not the lament.
It appears, rather, as if
processes are accessible to our analysis only, if we dissect them into
their static elements 3 more precisely, if we try to reconstruct them
from a static basis (which changes) and from certain forces (which
cause change).*
Talcott Parsons has been acutely aware of this prob-
lem of knowledge. For him, the concept of structure is therefore no
more than an inevitable expedient, no more than this constructed
"static basis": "Structure does not refer to any ontological stability in
phenomena but only to a relative stability—to sufficiently stable uni-
formities in the results of underlying processes so that their constancy
within
certain
limits
is
a workable
pragmatic assumption"
(217,
p. 217). Parsons and many other sociologists have also seen that the
next step of analysis must lie in the designation of the dynamic ele-
ments of social structures.
But in carrying out this designation they
make that central mistake which renders a large part of their cate-
gories useless for the analysis of structural change, and which there-
fore justifies the charge of a "static bias" in their approach.
Parsons continues the statement quoted above by saying: "Once
resort is made to the structure of a system as a positive constituent of
dynamic analysis there must be a way of linking these ^static' structural
categories ...
to the dynamically variable elements in the system.
This link
is supplied by the all-important concept of function.
Its
crucial role is to provide criteria of the importance of dynamic factors
and processes within the system. They are important in so far as they
have functional significance to the system." The consequential mis-
* There
is another way of looking at the same logical situation, and one that in
the long run may prove more appropriate.
In a Galilean sense, one might assume move-
ment as the normal state of affairs, and instead of looking
for forces that inaugurate
change one might concentrate on forces which arrest movement or slow
it down.
In
Chapter VI below we shall explore the applicability of this kind of approach
to prob-
lems of social change.

----- Page 141 (native) -----

take of this step of analysis already lies in its intention to find the dy-
namically variable elements "in the system." The category of func-
tion is indeed subordinated to that of structure.
Parts of a structure
have a function in relation to this structure as a whole.
In this sense
the category
is certainly important.
However,
it
is not "all-impor-
tant":
it is rather the first requisite of a dynamic analysis of structure
to find variables which are not subordinated to the category of struc-
ture (and are in this sense "within the system") but which operate as
forces or factors changing the structure. That Parsons, and with him
many other recent "theorists," have overlooked this fact may be due
to a more or less deliberate identification of organic and social struc-
tures or "systems." For this is the most difficult problem of the analy-
sis of structural change: by contrast to organic structures, the "dynami-
cally variable elements" which
influence the construction of
social
structures do not necessarily originate outside the "system" but may
be generated by the structure itself. There are, in other words, within
social structures certain elements or forces which are at the same time
their constituent parts (and therefore "function" within them) and
impulses operating toward their supersedence and change. As we shall
see, social classes are elements of this kind.
It
is neither necessary nor possible here to examine the implica-
tions of this critique in detail.
Moreover, we shall have to confine
ourselves to these few and necessarily abstract remarks, the empirical
relevance of which will emerge more clearly when we turn to the dis-
cussion of class or role interests.
Structural-functional analysis as
it
stands today fails to explain problems of change because
it does not
account for the peculiar character of social as opposed to organic struc-
tures.
It does not look for the dynamic variables that, though oper-
ating within given structures, are in principle independent of their
(constructed) functional integration.
If, as is the undisputed premise
of all sociological inquiry, we are ultimately concerned with the scien-
tific description and explanation of structural change, then we must
find, apart from the undoubtedly important construction of function-
ally integrated structures, elements which are independent of these
without being necessarily external to them and which determine rela-
tive stability as well as kind and degree of change of structural pat-
terns.
In identifying such factors we shall have to be careful not to
abandon the gain in systematic analysis achieved by the structural-
functional approach to the randomness of factors adduced ad hoc. The
emergence and operation of forces that change social structure are also
subject to laws which we may want to recognize.
Even the careful reader of Marx may ask himself, in vain, in what

----- Page 142 (native) -----

sense the rather abstract discussion of this section sustains Marx's posi-
tion (as the heading of
it promises).
Indeed, this discussion shows
how far sociology has advanced since Marx.
In the place of undiffer-
entiated and often implicit premises and assumptions we have today
almost too elaborate categories and theoretical standpoints.
Yet im-
plicit and perhaps not even conceived with full clarity as
it may be,
the right approach to dynamic social analysis can be discerned in the
works of Marx. Throughout his works, Marx displayed a strong con-
viction of the primacy of the analysis of structural change. He, too,
had to construct the model of a society ("capitalism") for this pur-
pose. But he did not stop there. Being intensely concerned with dis-
covering pattern in history, he searched for factors and forces that
promise to explain the process of social change. As we shall presently
see, Marx overstated his case, to say nothing of making numerous
mistakes in details of his theory.
But in so far as historical societies
are concerned, Marx never fell into the trap of abandoning the prob-
lem of change out of fascination with the beauty of his structural
model. His subject was social change, and the category of social struc-
ture was no more than a tool with which to tackle this elusive and
intricate problem.
SOCIAL CHANGE AND CLASS CONFLICT (l)
: MARX SUSTAINED
Many aspects of Marx's theory of class have to be rejected in the
light of sociological knowledge. These do not include, however, the
heuristic purpose of Marx's sociological work and its immediate con-
sequences.
It is without doubt important to develop categories to de-
scribe social changes.
Concepts like "role differentiation," "transfer-
ence of functions," "leveling of statuses," and the like serve this pur-
pose. But it is clearly more important to find ways and means to ex-
plain change.
It
is of course most unlikely that any one hypothesis
will be capable of accounting for all types of change that can be ob-
served in the course of history, and in so far as Marx advances an abso-
lutist claim for his own theory we shall have to depart from him radi-
cally. At the same time, Marx has explored one of the most interest-
ing, and perhaps the most significant, relationship between social struc-
ture and social change by postulating conflict groups and their clashes
as forces that make for change.
Obvious as
it may seem that social
conflicts often result in the modification of accepted patterns of organi-
zation and behavior, it has neither been seen by all nor been explored
as systematically by anybody as by Marx.
Throughout his life, Marx was clearly influenced by the memory

----- Page 143 (native) -----
Sociological Critique of Marx
125
of two events which overshadowed the consciousness of the nineteenth
century, although they were its heritage rather than its product:
the
French Revolution and the Industrial Revolution. There were obvi-
ous explanations for both of them, and these were widely held. One
might summarize them by the phrases that "men make history" and
that "inventions make history." Even today, historians find
it hard
to free themselves from the conception that at the turning points of
history there stood outstanding and powerful individuals or important
and consequential inventions.
Indeed,
it would be nonsensical to try
and deny the effect of these forces.
But, as Marx well knew, in the
French Revolution and the Industrial Revolution another kind of
force had also become apparent.
Apart from powerful individuals
and revolutionary inventions, larger and more anonymous aggrega-
tions of men had played a visible part in bringing about these events.
Nor had they been unanimous in purpose and action.
It was, rather,
the conflict between aggregates of differing (but considerable)
size,
and the changing fortunes of this conflict, that had effected a restruc-
turing of society so far-reaching that
it could only be called revolu-
tionary. As we shall see, the revolutionary tradition of the eighteenth
century not only inspired Marx but misled him as well. He tended to
believe that the only way in which social conflicts could produce struc-
tural changes was by revolutionary upheavals. But despite such errors
he did discover the formative force of conflicting social groups or
classes.
This "discovery"^
is accompanied, in the work of Marx, by
two steps of analysis which, although rather formal, are nevertheless
worth mentioning and sustaining.
Firstly, Marx succeeded in tracing conflicts that effect change back
to patterns of social structure. For him, social conflicts were not ran-
dom occurrences which forbid explanation and therefore prediction.
Rather, he believed these conflicts to be necessary outgrowths of the
structure of any given society and, in particular, of capitalist society.
It is doubtful whether Marx, by assuming property relations to be the
structural origin of conflict, was right in the substance of his analysis.
But this does not diminish the analytical achievement of tracing in the
structure of a given society the seeds of its supersedure. The idea of
a society which produces in its structure the antagonisms that lead to
" Like
all discoveries,
it
is not, strictly speaking, original.
It would not be
diffi-
cult
to
find, throughout the
history of pre-Marxian philosophy from
Heraclitus
to
Hegel, numerous thinkers who regarded "conflict as the father of
all things."
But
it
is Marx's merit to have embodied
this approach in
a
fairly systematic theory of the
generation and course of social conflict in modern societies.

----- Page 144 (native) -----
126
Sociological Critique of Marx
Its modification appears an appropriate model
for the analysis of
change in general.^
Secondly, Marx properly assumed the dominance of one particu-
lar conflict In any given situation. Whatever criticism may be required
of the Marxian theory, any theory of conflict has to operate with some-
thing like a two-class model. There are but two contending parties
this is implied in the very concept of conflict. There may be coalitions,
of course, as there may be conflicts internal to either of the contenders,
and there may be groups that are not drawn into a given dispute j but
from the point of view of a given clash of interests, there are never
more than two positions that struggle for domination. We can follow
Marx in this argument (which, for him,
is often more implicit than
explicit) even further.
If social conflicts effect change, and if they are
generated by social structure, then it is reasonable to assume that of the
two interests involved in any one conflict, one wiU be pressing for
change, the other one for the status quo.
This assumption, again,
is
based on logic as much as on empirical observation.
In every conflict,
one party attacks and another defends. The defending party wants
to retain and secure its position, while the attacking party has to fight
it in order to improve its own condition.
Once again,
it
is clear that
these statements remain on a high level of formality. They imply no
reference to the substance or the origin of conflicting interests.
But,
again, it will prove useful to have articulated the formal prerequisites
of Marx's and, indeed, of any theory of conflict.
With these formal points, however, our agreement with Marx
ends.
Although the heuristic purpose and general approach of his
theory of class can and must be sustained, this
is not the case with
respect to most other features of this theory. Only by rejecting these
can we hope to clear the way for a more useful theory of class conflict
in industrial societies.
SOCIAL CHANGE AND CLASS CONFLICT (ll)
: MARX REJECTED
Since Talcott Parsons wrote his Structure of Social Action the neg-
lect of a systematic analysis of the dynamics of social action by sociolo-
gists has become increasingly conspicuous. Only very recently have a
number of scholars set out to explore and map this white spot in the
® Parsons justly emphasizes, in an essay on Marx that
is surprising
in more than
one sense, this achievement of Marx and states that Marx "did

treating them at random" (67, p. 323).

atlas of sociological knowledge.
If only for this reason,
it is of some
importance to determine the logical status and limits of dynamic analy-
sis rather more precisely than is necessary today with respect to prob-
lems of, say, social stratification. We have tried to reduce the spongy
concept of social change to that of structural change. This constitutes a
gain, but
it is not in itself sufficient. At a later point we shall have to
return to the dangerous question "When does a structure begin to
change or, conversely, up to what point does it remain unchanged? "
a dangerous question because it implies an essentially static concept of
structure.
So far we have merely touched upon the two cardinal re-
quirements of a theory of change, i.e., the construction of the model of
a functionally integrated structure, and the discovery of certain factors
or forces the effect of which leads to a modification of this structural
model. As to the first of these requirements we have, in the structural-
functional approach, a considerable instrumentarium at our disposal
today. But with respect to the codification of forces that effect struc-
tural change everything is still to be done. Ad hoc and at random fac-
tors are introduced wherever necessary, and all too often these factors
are afterwards generalized in an impermissible manner. Thus we get
so-called theories of the primacy of the economy, of race, of elites, of
cultural diffusion—or of classes. We cannot hope to remedy the obvi-
ous lack of a systematic treatment of this subject by preliminary classi-
fications and delimitations as will be proposed here j but we can try to
avoid the most obvious errors of one-sided theories.
In order to do so,
however,
it will be inevitable that—as T. H. Marshall says with
pleasant irony of his own investigation (57, p. 10)—"I shall be run-
ning true to type as a sociologist" by proposing to divide our subject
into several distinct parts.
Among the forces that are capable of changing elements of social
structure, two large groups must evidently be distinguished—those
that originate outside a given structure and those that are generated by
the structure itself. We shall use for the former the concept of exoge-
nous structure change, or exogenous factors, and for the latter that of
endogenous structure change, or endogenous factors.^
^ M. J. Levy has introduced a similar distinction (209, p. 114).
"The strategic
factors
for change
(i.e.,
the
factors necessary and
sufficient
for
a change given
the
initial stage) may be
internal
factors
(i.e.,
factors produced by the operation of the
unit without any new influences from other units), or external
factors
(i.e.,
factors
newly introduced to the system from other units), or some combination of the two."
Unlike
us, however. Levy
is above
all concerned "with
cases of
strategic
external
factors."

Sociological Critique of Marx
If the invasion of an African territory by European conquerors
causes the abolition or modification of the chieftain system in certain
tribes, we are faced with exogenous structure change. But the separa-
tion of ownership and control or the institutionalization of class con-
flict in post-capitalist society are endogenous, whichever factors one
may identify as responsible for these changes.
It
is clear that this
distinction
is strictly possible only in analytical and not in empirical
contexts.
In conspicuous structure changes in particular, such as the
industrial revolution, exogenous and endogenous forces usually com-
bine to produce the change.
It
is an important task of the empirical
analysis of specific problems to disentangle the two and assess their
respective weights.
Within each of these fields of factors further distinctions are re-
quired.
Thus, exogenous change can result from military conquest
and deliberate intervention with existing structures 5 but
it can also
result from the diffusion of culture patterns unaccompanied by politi-
cal or military force.
In past decades, many efforts have been made,
above all by social anthropologists, to bring the different forms of
exogenous change into an ordered context by introducing such concepts
as "diffusion," later "acculturation," "culture contact," and "culture
change."
Empirical instances of some of these forms have been stud-
ied in great detail.
But despite Malinowski's attempt to systematize
such approaches (213), this effort has not yet advanced beyond a loose
catalogue of possible factors. The sociology of war and of contacts
between advanced societies
(until now an utterly neglected field of
study) could also contribute to closing this gap in theory.
However, we are not only no further, but possibly less advanced,
with respect to the
classification of forces operative
in endogenous
structure change, although many seem to think that this is the proper
subject matter of sociological inquiry. Although the number of such
factors proposed by sociologists to
fulfill requirements of research
(and sometimes demands of philosophical or political convictions)
grows steadily, a systematic examination of these factors and their
interrelations has not even been attempted.
The matter
is further
complicated by the fact that in some cases, such as the differentiation
of roles or functions and of technological processes, we can hardly
venture a guess as to which factors contribute to their emergence, to
say nothing of certain knowledge about them. Marx's attempt to con-
nect the development of productive forces with that of classes marks
one of the weakest points in his sociology.
It appears most improbable
that the complication of the social division of labor, or technological

----- Page 147 (native) -----
Sociological Critique of Marx
129
processes that have social consequences, can be explained in terms of
group conflicts.
In any case, structure changes resulting from social
conflicts between organized groups or between the representatives of
unorganized masses constitute but one form of endogenous change.
Even within this considerably restricted sphere of social conflicts
afi^ecting structure change
it is not only possible but necessary to dis-
tinguish a plurality of different forms.
It obliterates the precision of
analysis if, with one and the same set of categories, we try to analyze
conflicts between slaves and freemen in ancient Rome, Negroes and
whites in the United States, Catholics andProtestants in contemporary
Holland, capital and labor in capitalist society—to mention only a few
possibilities.
All these conflicts can result in structure changes; they
are in this sense factors of endogenous change. Moreover, several of
these types of conflict may be superimposed on each other, and may
thus constitute a single conflict front in a given country and situation.
For purposes of analysis, however, it is necessary to introduce distinc-
tions if one wants to master reality with the tools of science.* Endog-
enous change
is but one kind of social structure change;
social con-
flict is but one of the causes of endogenous change; and class conflict
is but one type of social conflict. Endogenous change may be of great,
even dominant, significance in a given society; but that is a matter for
empirical research.
In principle a theory of class illuminates only a
small segment of the wide field which can be described by the vague
concept of structure change. We can neither expect nor, above
all,
assume that a theory of class will cast a glimmer of its light on other
aspects of structure change as well.
It is apparent that from this point of view Marx is in a sense guilty
of the same mistake of which, in a diff^erent context, we have accused
those who have endeavored to supersede the theory of class with a
theory of stratification.
They, too, have illegitimately transposed a
theory from its legitimate place to other areas of inquiry. The asser-
tion that the history of all past society is the history of class struggles
is either meaningless or false.
It is meaningless if it is merely intended
to say that, inter alia, there were also class conflicts in every society.
But Marx did not mean this. He believed that the dominant conflicts
of every society were class conflicts, and indeed that all social conflicts
and all structure changes can be explained in terms of antagonisms of
class.
This generalization
is as impermissible as
it
is untenable. The

flicts,

conflicts"

; but this

place to which we have assigned the theory of class may appear modest.
In fact, this reduced significance of class analysis will be corrected to a
certain extent with respect to the particular historical constellations of
industrial societies.
This does not alter the fact, however, that social
analysis in terms of class—as Gurvitch remarks quite rightly (50, p.
290)—"does not by any means provide a key which opens all doors
to the solution of problems of social change."
I would claim that only
by restricting the theory of class to one, if one major, aspect of struc-
tural change, can we hope to weld it into a useful tool of sociological
analysis.
CLASS CONFLICT AND REVOLUTION: MARX REJECTED
"The conflict between proletariat and bourgeoisie"
is, according
to Marx, "a conflict of one class against another, a struggle which in
its highest expression means a total revolution" ( 6, pp. 1 8 8 f
. )
. More
generally, the revolutionary character of social change
is for Marx
a central feature of his theory of class. Indeed, it appears to be Marx's
conviction that wherever classes exist structure change has always and
"necessarily" a revolutionary character. "Only in an order of things
where there are no classes and no class conflicts will the social evolu-
tions cease to be political revolutions" (6, p.
1 89).
It emerges clearly
from Marx's writings, and has never been doubted by his interpreters,
that the concept of revolution meant for him the sudden and rapid
upheaval of a social structure ; Marx did not speak of revolutions in
the extended sense of a "managerial revolution" and the like.^ This
conception, according to which social change occurs suddenly and by
widely visible explosions, has not been confined to Marx and his faith-
ful followers. Even Brinkmann betrays a trace of the conviction that
social changes are always revolutionary if they result from class con-
flict, when he observes an "evolutionary moderation of revolutionary
forces and patterns" in recent social development (192, p. 12).
Yet,
here again we find one of those untenable generalizations which bar
the path to our knowledge of reality and which have to be replaced by
more reasonable, if not empirically confirmed, assumptions. The error
that changes of social structure are generally of a revolutionary nature
is especially interesting for two reasons which are worth pursuing.
In
^ It
is however true that Lassalle and, following him, Renner have in the course
of their revision of Marx replaced the notion of the "revolution in the hay-fork sense"
(Lassalle) with the notion of gradual social changes.
But in doing so, these men were
aware of the fact that they had abandoned a central tenet of Marx's theory.

the first place this very assumption might, despite its dynamic appear-
ance, induce us to join
in with Bergson's lament about dissolving
change into "immobilities." In the thesis that a given structure can be
changed and transformed into a new one only by radical upheavals,
there
is ultimately an assumption that social structures are basically
static entities. Of course, Marx spoke of the "law of development,"
that is, of the dynamics of capitalist society. But this law of develop-
ment was for him little more than the law of development of an or-
ganism:
the gradual unfolding of a "system" to
its inherent image.
The structure, or "system,"
is as such immutable.
If
it changes,
it is
destroyed
entirely.
It changes
in one
stroke
(or
at
least by one
"stroke") in all its parts and thus becomes a new "system." This is a
point at which Marx and Parsons meet in a curious fashion:
both of
them freeze the flow of the historical process in the idea of a "system."
If we accept this, either structure change can be nonexistent (which,
by an extreme interpretation, might be called the Parsonian "solu-
tion"), or it exists only as revolutionary change (the Marxian "solu-
tion"). Both those solutions are equally unsatisfactory and untenable.
They testify, moreover, to the insufficiency of all conscious or uncon-
scious analogies between organic and social "systems."
If changes of social structure are invariably revolutionary in char-
acter, there can be no change without revolutions.
It is easy to see how
at this point the sophistic argument offers itself that Western indus-
trial societies have remained unchanged since Marx because they have
not experienced revolutions. But
it is also easy to see how miserably
an assertion of this kind fails to account for the processes of reality.
We have seen that many recent sociological theories of class conflict
refer to a "revolution" in the social development of past decades. The
use of the term "revolution" for processes which are neither sudden
nor explosive bears witness to the extent to which "revolution" and
"change" are interlaced in general opinion.
Quite contrary to such
ill-considered formulations,
it is the decisive characteristic of the de-
velopment of industrial societies since Marx that profound structure
changes have occurred without sudden, widely visible upheavals.
In
this sense, social development of the past decades furnishes evidence
for the ubiquity and gradualness of social change and for the untena-
bility of the assertion that change must always be revolutionary.
For Marx, the
assertion of the revolutionary nature of
social
change has another aspect which appears no less untenable in the light
of empirical knowledge.
Before Marx, Hegel had, when analyzing
the dialectics of "wealth" and "poverty" in his Phenomenology of

----- Page 150 (native) -----
132
Sociological Critique of Marx
Mind^ identified the "deepest depravation," "purest inequality," and
"absolute insignificance of the absolutely significant" with the "deep-
est rebellion" (226, p. 368).
Insignificantly changed, this idea re-
appears when Marx says that the proletariat "is forced, by the irre-
jectable,
indefensible, absolutely commanding need—the
practical
expression of necessity—to rebel against this inhumanity" (4, p. 207).
It is only a step from here to Marx's assertion that the class struggle
will become more intense as the life situation of the proletariat dete-
riorates and will culminate in a revolution when the point is reached at
which this situation has attained its extreme. Even from the point of
view of a sociology of revolution, this assumption can be regarded as
disproved today. Revolutions and revolts do not occur when need and
oppression have reached an extreme point j they occur rather once this
extreme has been passed and the lethargy given with it superseded."
Beyond this empirical inadequacy, Marx's notion of a linear increase
of the violence of class conflict to the breaking-point of the revolution
proves a Hegelian heritage which contributes little to our understand-
ing of reality.
Plausible as the application of dialectics to history may
appear,
its schematized and simplified consequences rarely survive
empirical test.
If in this study I refer to structure change, I do not therefore mean
revolutions.
If I refer to class conflict, I do not imply an assumption
that it is subject to an "inevitable" process of intensification leading up
to a revolutionary explosion.
Although the construction of a struc-
tural model is a prerequisite of the systematic analysis of change, this
structural model must not be viewed as a monolithic entity which in
some unknown sense can only change "as a whole." Rather, structure
change has to be assumed as a permanent aspect of every society.
It
can begin in one sphere of a structure, such as industry, and propagate
to other spheres, such as political society; but
it can also remain con-
fined to one sphere. Even if, for example, it could be shown that the
separation of ownership and control in industry has no consequence for
the political structure of society, such a separation would nevertheless
constitute a structural change. Only if we view structure change as a
ubiquitous and constituent element of social structure do we free our-
selves of the fetters of the assumption that social change is always of
a revolutionary character. At the same time we can thus avoid the in-

eral, these events provide many an illustration for the theses advanced in this and the
following chapters of this study.

soluble task of determining when and where processes of change "be-
gin" and "end."
Regarding class conflict, one important assumption follows from
this decision.
If social change is not confined to revolutionary explo-
sions but
is a constituent element of every structure as such,
it
is no
longer necessary to assert a linear development of classes and class
conflicts toward the point of revolution. For Marx, the classes them-
selves were within a given system something like "organisms" with
a predetermined course of development leading to their perfection.
It
follows from
this
that, among other
things, organized
classes
begin to affect the structure within which they have grown only in the
moment of revolution, and that their changing force is indeed confined
to
this moment.
All
that happens before the revolution happens
merely in preparation for this event j afterwards, the classes of the old
society dissolve.
Again, this simplifying assumption robs the concept
of class of its empirical value for nonrevolutionary processes, and that
means for the majority of social processes.
Again, we have to depart
radically from Marx. The "necessity" of a linear intensification of
class conflict is in any case a nonsociological postulate which has to be
rejected. Moreover, it will prove reasonable to view the interrelations
of classes as potentially a process of permanent readjustment. Periods
of violent conflict can be succeeded by others of relative harmony, and
vice versa.
There
is no general law that determines the course of
clashes and struggles between classes j and no revolutionary upheaval
can be postulated as a "normal" goal and climax of class conflict. The
course of conflicts between classes presents a problem which cannot be
solved by arbitrarily introducing assumptions or premises but has to
be determined on the basis of empirical investigations into particular
historical constellations in particular societies.
SOCIAL CLASSES AND CLASS CONFLICT: MARX REJECTED
In rejecting the premise of a predetermined course of class conflict,
we implicitly deny the validity of a further assertion that is part and
parcel of Marx's theory of class, namely, that classes are always mani-
festly antagonistic groups or tend toward manifest
conflicts.
The
assumptions rejected so far were more or less peripheral for Marx's
theory of class, but here we come to its core.
This cannot prevent us
from rejecting untenable assumptions without hesitation, but it makes
caution imperative, if we do not want to run the risk of disputing the
heuristic value of any theory of class together with the problematic
aspects of its Marxian formulation.
"Individuals," Marx says at one

place, "form a class only in so far as they are engaged in a common
struggle against another class" (13, II, p. 59).
This statement con-
tains, if it is interpreted in the light of other statements of Marx about
the same matter, a necessary assumption and a false empirical generali-
zation. In the interest of an analytically useful theory of class we shall
have to separate the two.
The theory of class aims at a systematic analysis of one of the
causes of the endogenous structure change of societies.
It has its place
within the wider context of the analysis of structural changes caused
by social conflicts. From this it is evident that, however one may choose
to define classes, they must always be regarded as groupings related to
each other in such a way that their interplay is determined by a struc-
turally conditioned conflict of interests.
In this sense, one class alone
is a contradictio in adiecto ; there must always be two classes.
In this
sense, also, Stalin's concept of "nonantagonistic classes"
is meaning-
less j where there are classes, there is conflict. Inasmuch as any theory
of class is a theory of structure change by social conflict, the assump-
tion of a conflict between classes
is part of the definition of classes.
There can thus be no reason to reject Marx's formulation on this point.
But beyond this formal statement, Marx postulated acute and vio-
lent conflict ("class struggle") as part of the definition of classes; and
we cannot follow him in this step.
That class conflict invariably as-
sumes violent forms and becomes civil war is an assumption the em-
pirical character of which Marx could not abolish by joining it to his
definition of the concept of class. "Exactly how serious the element of
conflict
is becomes a matter of empirical investigation" (Parsons, 67,
p. 324). What evidence we have permits at least the negative con-
clusion that class conflict does not always assume the form of civil war.
Instead, a phenomenon like the institutionalization of class conflict
shows that an "oppressed" class may well be capable of effecting struc-
ture changes by discussion and negotiation. Here, as elsewhere, more
acute analysis reveals that the overly simple assumptions of Marx tend
to obliterate rather than illuminate the intricacies of the problem of
class.
Parsons introduced for purposes of a subtler analysis of class rela-
tions the useful concept of "potential" or "latent conflicts" (67, p.
329).
Apart from the actual or manifest clashes between classes
it
seems reasonable to distinguish at least two kinds of latent conflicts.
Marx has himself dealt with one of these, namely, with what one
might call the immature conflicts between classes which are still in the
process of formation and organization.
But a second form of latent

----- Page 153 (native) -----
Sociological Critique of Marx
135
class conflict seems even more important.
It appears that conflicting
classes can, for several reasons, co-exist for shorter or longer periods
of time in a kind of "armistice" without engaging in open struggles.
Some of the symptoms of this reduction of manifest to latent conflicts
are well known and confirmed by considerable evidence: common
interests, such
as national
interests in emergency situations, can be
superimposed on group antagonisms for certain (limited)
periods
j
conflicts can be formalized to the extent of being transformed into dis-
cussions between plenipotentiaries or representatives in parliaments or
industrial negotiation bodies. At this point, too, sociological analysis
has to turn away from the sterile magic of definitional premises to the
investigation of empirical conditions under which latent conflicts be-
come manifest or manifest conflicts fade into the background.
Some authors prefer to describe antagonisms and tensions which
are not expressed in manifest struggles in terms other than conflict.
Thus, they distinguish
conflicts and tensions, conflicts and disputes,
conflicts and contests, or—most frequently—conflict and competition.
Such terminological distinctions are in fact in keeping with common
usage. We do, indeed, tend to associate with the word "conflict" visi-
ble clashes between
forces,
i.e., antagonisms which are manifest
as
such. A football game, a competition between applicants for a job, a
parliamentary debate, or a legal contest are not usually called con-
flicts. However, it will be evident from the preceding discussion that
I am using the term "conflict" in this study for contests, competitions,
disputes, and tensions as well as for manifest clashes between social
forces.
All relations between sets of individuals that involve an in-
compatible difference of objective—i.e., in
its most general form, a
desire on the part of both contestants to attain what is available only
to one, or only in part—are, in this sense, relations of social conflict.
The general concept of conflict does not as such imply any judgment
as to the intensity or violence of relations caused by differences of ob-
jective.
Conflict may assume the form of civil war, or of parliamen-
tary debate, of a strike, or of a well-regulated negotiation.
It is important to realize that this conceptual decision is not merely
of terminological significance.
It implies, and
is supposed to imply,
that
civil war and parliamentary debate, strike and negotiation are
essentially motivated by the same type of social relationship and are
therefore but different manifestations of an identical force.
In what
sense this definition of conflict makes possible a fruitful reformulation
of problems will become apparent in our subsequent considerations.
We have already seen, however, that by identifying conflict and revo-

----- Page 154 (native) -----
136
Sociological Critique of Marx
lution, or conflict and civil war, Marx has obscured more problems
than he solved. Whoever uses the category of class without assuming
the presence of class conflict abuses this category.
It is the declared aim
of class theory to explain one type of constitutional group conflict in
social structures. But the empirical hypothesis is false that insists that
this class conflict must always assume the form of violent civil war and
"class struggle."
Indeed, it seems plausible that under certain condi-
tions (which
it
is possible to determine)
class antagonism becomes
latent or is reactivated from a state of latency.
Social classes and class
conflict are categories connected inseparably j but type and intensity
of the conflicts in which particular classes are involved in a particular
situation can be discovered only by studying empirical conditions.
PROPERTY AND SOCIAL CLASS! MARX REJECTED
For Marx, the determinant of social classes was effective private
property in the means of production.
In all essential elements, his
theory of class is based on this definition of the concept of class. We
have seen, meanwhile, that precisely this tie between the concept of
class and the possession of, or exclusion from, effective private prop-
erty limits the applicability of class theory to a relatively short period
of European social history. A theory of class based on the division of
society into owners and nonowners of means of production loses
its
analytical value as soon as legal ownership and factual control are
separated. For this reason, any effective supersedure of Marx's theory
of class has to start at this point. Now, it
is one of the central theses
of this study that such a supersedure
is possible
if we replace the
possession, or nonpossession, of effective private property by the exer-
cise of, or exclusion from, authority as the criterion of class forma-
tion.
Renner, Schumpeter, Burnham, Djilas, and others have pre-
pared the ground for this decision; by contrast to most of these we
shall not confine the notion of authority to the control of the means
of production, but consider it as a type of social relations analytically
independent of economic conditions. The authority structure of entire
societies as well as particular institutional orders within societies (such
as industry)
is, in terms of the theory here advanced, the structural
determinant of class formation and class conflict. The specific type
of change of social structures caused by social classes and their con-
flicts
is ultimately the result of the differential distribution of posi-
tions of authority in societies and their institutional orders.
Control
over the means of production is but a special case of authority, and the
connection of control with legal property an incidental phenomenon

of the
industrializing
societies of Europe and the United
States.
Classes are tied neither to private property nor to industry or eco-
nomic structures in general, but as an element of social structure and
a factor effecting change they are as universal as their determinant,
namely, authority and
its distribution itself. On the basis of a con-
cept of class defined by relations of authority, a theory can be formu-
lated which accounts for the facts described by Marx as well as for
the changed reality of post-capitalist society.
At several points of our investigation it has become apparent how
many doubts and objections can be raised against Marx's treatment
of the relationship between property and social class.
In presenting
Marx's theory, in describing the phenomenon of the separation of
ownership and control, and in discussing Burnham's inferences from
this phenomenon and Djilas's analysis of Communist totalitarianism,
we have seen how, by connecting the concept of
class with private
property (and thereby capitalism), Marx renders this concept
fit for
inclusion in his philosophical conception of history but unfit for the
sociological analysis even of the conflicts with which he was concerned.
Marx, too,
is concerned with relations of authority j indeed, he ex-
plicitly refers to these when he describes class conflicts generated by
the structure of the industrial enterprise.
But Marx believed that
authority and power are factors which can be traced back to a man's
share in effective private property.
In reality, the opposite is the case.
Power and authority are irreducible
factors from which the
social
relations associated with legal private property as well as those asso-
ciated with communal property can be derived. Burnham, and above
all Geiger, have rightly stressed that property
is in
its sociological
aspect in the first place a permission to exclude others from control
over an object.
It is therefore (Weber, 33*^, p, 28
) a "chance to find
obedience with defined persons for an order"
(in this case a prohi-
bition),
i.e., a form of authority.
But property
is by no means the
only form of authority j
it is but one of its numerous types. Whoever
tries, therefore, to define authority by property defines the general
by the
particular—an obvious
logical
fallacy.
Wherever
there
is
property there
is authority, but not every form of authority implies
property.
Authority
is the more general social relation.
This formal argument is not, however, the only reason for sub-
stituting for Marx's definition of classes by private property one by
a man's share in authority j this generalization
is necessary, also, for
the sake of the empirical applicability of the theory of class.
For this
purpose,
it is moreover necessary to separate radically the concept of

----- Page 156 (native) -----
138
Sociological Critiqtie of Marx
authority from
its narrow application to the control over economic
means of production.
Just as property is formally, thus control over
the means of production is empirically but a special case of those gen-
eral relations of authority which, according to our conception, lie at the
base of class formation and class conflict. Why this extension
is em-
pirically necessary will be shown in detail
in the following section
of this chapter, where we deal with the relation between industrial
and social authority structures.
However, this much can be stated
even without a more detailed discussion: that a theory of group conflict
the central category of which is defined by a man's share in the control
of the means of production can apply only to the sphere of industrial
production.
In any case, its significance for structure change would
be even more restricted than is the significance of the theory of class.
To say that classes are based on a man's share in legitimate power
is not to formulate an empirical hypothesis.
If this were so, it would
presuppose an independent definition of the concept of
class.
It
is
rather a definition which, in a preliminary way, we can state as fol-
lows: classes are social conflict groups the determinant (or differentia
specifica) of which can be found in the participation in or exclusion
from the exercise of authority within any imperatively coordinated
association.
In
this sense,
classes differ from other conflict groups
which rest on religious, ethnic, or legal differences.
In principle, a
definition is of course an arbitrary decision.
If it is logically unassail-
able,
it cannot be refuted by empirical facts.
Yet the definition pro-
posed here
is more than a terminological decision without empirical
consequences. We shall see that this decision alone opens up many
new possibilities for the analysis of social conflicts.
At the same time, the definition of classes by people's participa-
tion in or exclusion from the exercise of authority distinguishes this
category clearly from many earlier definitions.^^ The concept of class
proposed here as promising an eflPective supersedure of Marx's con-
cept is not based on the level or source of income. Even those sociolo-
gists who rightly sought the analytical place of a theory of class in
the study of social conflict have tended to retain two aspects of the
Marxian concept of class which I propose to abandon. Most of them
^^ It
is perhaps necessary to emphasize at this point that our definition, as formu-
lated so far, contains many ambiguities and
is bound to raise doubts.
In this chapter,
I confine myself to statements required by the critical dissociation from Marx. A more
detailed discussion of power and authority as determinants of social class will be found
in the subsequent chapter; in the course of this discussion the definition proposed here
will become rather more specific and,
I hope, unambiguous.

maintained (i) that classes are in some sense "economic** groupings
and (2) that the lines of class structure run parallel to those of social
stratification. So far as I can see, neither Marshall nor Geiger, neither
Schumpeter nor Lipset and Bendix have renounced these two stipula-
tions. "To us," Lipset and Bendix state (55, pp. 244, 248), "the pur-
pose of research in this field
is an analysis of the incessant interplay
between the factors of stratification which make for social change and
those which tend to arrest it." And: "The analysis of social class
is
concerned with an assessment of the chances that common economic
conditions
.
.
. will lead to organized action." Geiger similarly views
social classes as "a special case of social strata/^ namely, strata "de-
termined by the relations of production"
(46,
p.
35).
Although
Marshall goes one step further by trying to dissociate the concept of
class from economic conditions and extend
it to a notion of "social
class," he,
too,
insists that the phenomenon of
class "represents a
hierarchical social stratification'* (58, p. 90).^^
Both the stipulation
that class is a phenomenon of stratification and that it is associated with
economic conditions are fetters from which we have to free this cate-
gory in order to transform
it into a useful tool of social analysis.
If we define classes by relations of authority,
it
is ipso facto evi-
dent that "economic classes,"
i.e., classes within economic organiza-
tions, are but a special case of the phenomenon of class. Furthermore,
even within the sphere of industrial production
it
is not really eco-
nomic factors that give rise to class formation, but a certain type of
social relations which we have tried to comprehend in the notion of
authority. Classes are neither primarily nor at all economic groupings.
It is less easy to determine the relation between classes as authority
groups and the system of social stratification.
In the first place,
it is
important to realize that there
is no one-to-one correlation between
class structure and social stratification in the sense that classes result
from people's place in the hierarchy of stratification. The analyses
of class and of social stratification are essentially independent subjects
of sociological inquiry. On the other hand, there
is between them a
significant indirect connection which results from the
fact that au-
thority, the determinant of
class,
is
at
the same time one of the
determinants of social status.
It can be demonstrated that there is an
empirical tendency for the possession of authority to be accompanied,
within certain limits and with significant exceptions, by high income
and high prestige, and, conversely, for the exclusion from authority
^" All
italics in this paragraph are mine.

----- Page 158 (native) -----
140
Sociological Critique of Marx
to be accompanied by relatively low income and prestige.
Indeed,
it
is one of the distinguishing features of authority that
it can become
an instrument for the satisfaction of other desires and needs and for
the attainment of directly gratifying social rewards.
Thus, there
is
in most societies a tendential, if not unequivocal, correlation between
the distribution of authority and the system of social rewards that
underlies stratification.^^
In
this
sense, but only
in
this sense, the
partial parallelism between the lines of class division and those of
social stratification may be an empirical fact. One might go further
and regard this parallelism as probable, as
it could be argued that a
certain correspondence between people's share
in authority and
in
social rewards in general is a functional imperative of relatively stable
societies.
But no parallelism between structures of class and stratifi-
cation can be postulated.
Classes can be identical with strata, they can
unite several
strata within them, and their structure can cut right
through the hierarchy of stratification.
For purposes of clarity it seemed advisable to state, in the strong-
est possible terms, the way in which class is independent of property,
economic
conditions, and
social
stratification.
In
the
abstract, no
qualification need be made to this statement.
Fortunately, however,
empirical conditions do not usually reproduce the simplicity of our
assumptions and theories. Although the idea of property, of the re-
lationships that have to do with production, and of the hierarchy of
social stratification
is, in each instance, clearly distinct from the idea
of class, these factors have a great deal to do with the realities of
social class and class conflict. Without doubt, the fact that at the time
Marx wrote there were capitalists who simultaneously owned and con-
trolled their enterprises contributed greatly to the formation of classes
and the antagonism between them.
Similarly, the fact that it is pos-
sible to identify the powerful with the wealthy cannot be overlooked
in class analysis.
While the connection between property and social
class is not one of definition or mutual dependence, it is one that affects
the empirical course of class conflict.
If distinctions of property are
superimposed on distinctions of class, class conflict is likely to be more
violent than
if these two lines of social differentiation diverge. An
analogous argument could be made for class and social stratification.
In fact, this is one of many points at which Marx has transformed a
^^ We can leave open, here, whether this correlation can be explained in terms of
a common basic factor, such as a "value system" (Parsons), or whether
it
is due to the
direct eflFect of authority.
I doubt that a final answer to this problem
is methodolog-
ically possible.

correct empirical observation into a false and useless assumption by
arbitrarily generalizing what was characteristic only of the compara-
tively short historical period which he lived to see.
INDUSTRY AND SOCIETY: MARX REJECTED
The substitution of relations of authority for those of production
in defining class is but a radical interpretation of some of the theories
discussed in the preceding chapter.
Djilas, Schumpeter, Renner, Gei-
ger, and, above all, Burnham in his theory of managerial power, have
paved the way for this step.
But Burnham makes a curious mistake
which
is worth examining in some
detail.
There
is an interesting
nuance peculiar to his approach which rapidly turns into a consequen-
tial fallacy and renders his theory empirically nonsensical and ana-
lytically useless.
Burnham tries to supersede Marx^s theory by re-
placing the narrow legal concept of property by a wider sociological
concept.
Quite rightly he defines property relations (the particular)
by authority relations (the general).
But with a theoretical inaccu-
racy which is characteristic of his work he now reverses this definition
and declares authority relations (the general) to be property relations
(the particular).
The managers have property ownership because
they have factual control. At best, this reversal results in a nonsensi-
cal extension of the concept of property to all forms of authority, in
which case the head of state would have property in "his" state.
At
worst, however, and this
is Burnham's case, the logical somersault
is
followed by an empirical salto mortale consisting in the assertion that
authority can exist only where there is property, or, as Burnham says
himself, that "the instruments of production are the seat of social
domination"
( 140, p. 125). Marx and Burnham meet in the premise
that economic power
is eo ipso political power, because there
is no
power except that based on ownership
in the means of production.
But both of them are wrong, and their error makes it necessary to pose
the problem of the relation between economic and social power anew.
It must be emphasized, in the
first place, that the relations be-
tween industry and society can be established only by empirical in-
vestigation. There
is no axiomatic identity between the managers or
capitalists of industry and the ministers or highest
civil servants of
the state, just as the exclusion of industrial workers from top political
positions is by no means an unchangeable element in the structure of
industrial
societies.
Again,
it was true
in Marx's own time, and in
English society, that the captains of industry or their relatives tended
to monopolize many of the leading political positions. The same
is

----- Page 160 (native) -----
142

still true In several countries, including the United States and Ger-
many. But this particular observation does not legitimize the formu-
lation of a general law. Should this law nevertheless be advanced as
a hypothesis, then
it was refuted by the
first government of a labor
party in an industrial country. The political state and industrial pro-
duction are two essentially independent associations in which power
is exercised j and their interrelations are a subject for empirical re-
search.
Once again, we must supplement, if not correct, an unequivocal
analytical distinction by empirical facts. A number of empirical gen-
eralizations about the particular—and especially close—relation be-
tween the organizations of industrial production and the state are in
fact possible for modern societies. Among all imperatively coordi-
nated associations apart from the state, those of industry occupy, in-
deed, a place which endows them with particular significance in con-
nection with conflicts in industrial societies.
This is above all because
of three factors which distinguish industry from all other institutional
orders of society, with the exception of the state itself: the mere size
of industrial production,
its significance for the lives of those who
participate in
it, and the severity of the sanctions at the disposal of
the rulers of industry.
If in this context we refer to industry, we always mean primarily
that sector of the economy of advanced societies which
is concerned
with commodity production in enterprises (factories), and in which
"means of production" exist in the strict sense of the term.
By in-
dustry we mean, in other words, what C. Clark would call "secondary
production."
This delimitation seems justified by the fact that the
enterprise of industrial production displays with particular clarity the
traits of an association coordinated by relations of authority.
In in-
dustrial societies, the sector of secondary production is prominent even
in terms of its purely physical extent.
Nearly one out of every two
citizens of such societies earns his living in industrial enterprises of
production. Their position in the national economy exceeds that of all
other branches of activity.
Moreover, the enterprises of production
themselves grow into mammoth organizations with a hundred thou-
sand employees or more. Without doubt, Drucker is right in empha-
sizing the special place of the modern large corporation.
The particular significance of large-scale industry
is further em-
phasized by the
fact that those who earn their living in
industrial
enterprises spend a large part of their lives there and for an even larger
part are under the influence of the social relations characteristic of

----- Page 161 (native) -----
Sociological Critique of Marx
143
industry.
Sociologists have often emphasized the importance of occu-
pational roles in industrial societies j these roles also have their rami-
fications in problems of class conflict.
Since the authority relations of
industrial production occupy so large a space in the lives of so many
people, they tend to overshadow the authority relations of most,
if
not all, other associations.
Except for the political society—the state
—no other imperatively coordinated organization can compare with
industrial production in the number of persons affected by
its struc-
ture and in the intensity of this influence.
Finally, the special position
of industrial production
is due to the type of sanction inflicted by
it.
Weber defined the state in terms of the monopoly of physical force
in a given territory. But even in recent times there are examples where
the managers of industrial enterprises of production have broken this
monopoly and used their own police force to try to enforce the obedi-
ence of their workers.^* Even apart from extreme cases of this kind,
dismissal and even removal to a worse-paid position constitutes in-
fringements on the lives of people so severe that one could call them
at least quasi-physical sanctions. The severity of sanctions is not the
least cause of the fact that under certain conditions conflicts within
industrial organizations may transcend their limits and dominate the
scene of social conflict.
These are empirical generalizations. Although they underline the
significance of industry for industrial societies, no universal law of
connection or interrelation between industrial and political power can
be derived from them. On the contrary, we shall argue at a later point
that
the
validity even
of
these
generalizations
can
be
restricted
by
social changes and has been restricted by recent developments.
Nevertheless, we can conclude from the considerations of this section
that the organizations of industrial production play a prominent part
in modern societies.
While in principle the problem of the relation
of particular associations to the political state has to be posed anew
for each association, that of the relation between industry and society
has de facto a certain primacy in industrial societies. The state
is an
association coordinated by authority relations, and so is industrial pro-
duction. The questions whether the structures of the one are also
those of the other, whether the rulers of industry are also directly
or indirectly those of the state, and whether the powerless of industry
are also powerless politically stand
in the center of any analysis of

industrial societies in terms of class.
Although we have to reject as
untenable or, perhaps, as a refuted empirical generalization Marx's
assertion that political power follows "necessarily" from industrial
power, his premise reveals—as
is so often the case in his work—
correct feeling, an instinct, even, for empirically significant relations.
Even today
it
is one of the essential tasks of class analysis to explain
industrial conflict with the model of a class theory and to examine the
ramifications of industrial conflict for the political process in terms of
specific hypotheses. As to the result of such an examination, we can
but suspect that
it will bring out more complex and less one-sided
relations than Burnham or Marx believed existed.
SOCIAL ROLES AND THEIR PERSONNEL:
MARX SUPPLEMENTED
The problem of the relation between individuals and classes has
been as conspicuously neglected by Marx as
it has been overempha-
sized by modern sociologists.
It is not surprising that neglect cannot
solve the problem, but
it is unfortunately true that neither has over-
emphasis.
Despite many a treatment of the problem, there
is as yet
no clear formulation of its several dimensions. "For the individual,"
Schumpeter says, "his belonging to a certain class
is a given fact"j
he
is "born into a certain class position." More accurately, this does
not hold for the individual qua individual: "The family, and not the
physical person,
is the true individual of class theory" (27, p. 158).
Marshall refers to this statement of Schumpeter's but contrasts it with
the latter's other thesis, according to which "classes which by their
character and relative position might be called identical social indi-
viduals never consist of the same family individuals for any length
of time, but always of different ones" (27, p.
170).
Against
this,
Marshall postulates "some permanence
in the grouping, so
that a
man who belongs to a certain class remains in
it unless—to use a col-
loquialism—'something
is done about it'" (58, p. 91).
Again, we
encounter the problem in Renner's analysis, which goes even further
than Marshall's: "Like its causes, class position is almost without ex-
ception lasting, comprising the whole
life and sequence of genera-
tions.
.
.
.
Every
class develops
in
its members a uniform type"
(70, p.
103).
Parsons lays less stress on the time aspect but,
like
Schumpeter, defines the "class position of an individual" as the po-
sition "which he shares with other members in an effective kinship
unit,"
i.e., as a family position (67, p. 328).

others.
I quote them only to indicate a general problem about which
some agreement will have to be reached in order for concept and
theory of class to become useful tools of sociological analysis.
So far, we have referred to classes only in connection with social
positions or roles.
Authority structures as well as the associations in
which they prevail can in principle be analyzed independent of the
actions and motives of their specific human representatives. They are
facts of structure which, like the parts of a play or an organization
chart, can be analyzed without reference to the specific individuals
who occupy the positions.
It seems to me one of the most important
discoveries of modern sociology that in analyzing class structure—as
of course most other phenomena of social structure—we can and must
concentrate on such quasi-objective facts, on roles and role structures.
Here, again, Marx displayed an admirable
instinct. "We are con-
cerned here," he says in the preface to his Capital, "with persons only
in so far as they are the personifications of economic categories, car-
riers of certain class relations and interests" (12, p.
8).
However,
today we should substitute for the "only" in Marx's statement an "in
the first place," for the second and equally important step of struc-
tural analysis is concerned with the relation between social roles and
their personnel.
Marx deliberately avoided
this stepj he confined
himself to introducing, wherever necessary, certain ad hoc assumptions
which bear on this relation.
Here, the traditional theory of class re-
quires not so much criticism or supersedence as supplementation.
The problem of the relation between social roles and the persons
who occupy them appears in more recent literature on the theory of
class under four main aspects which
it is useful to distinguish
:
( i ) the
problem of the determinant of class, (2)
the problem of class be-
havior, (3) the problem of stability, and (4) the problem of recruit-
ment to classes. The first of these problems results, as we shall see,
from an erroneous conception of the subject matter of class analysis;
it is in this sense a false problem. The substance of the solution of
the second and third problems
is a matter of class theory itself and
will therefore be postponed to subsequent chapters j these preliminary
considerations aim only at the precise formulation of questions re-
lating to these problems. The solution of the fourth problem follows
from our earlier discussions and can therefore be formulated here.
(i) For more than thirty years the distinction between "subjec-
tive" or "subjectivist" and "objective" or "objectivist" concepts and
even theories of class—a distinction that is as unclear as
it is superflu-
ous—has deflected sociological discussion from the proper
field of

----- Page 164 (native) -----
146
Sociological Critique of Marx
class analysis.
It is little surprising that in this discussion the rubber
terms "objective" and "subjective" were themselves subject to many
a fluctuation of meaning.
If we return here briefly to this question,
we do so only because it might appear to have something to do with
the relation between (subjective?) individuals and (objective?) social
classes.
By "subjective" theories of class most classifiers mean conceptions
which are in some sense "social psychological" (Geiger), according
to which "a man belongs to the class that he feels he belongs to"
(Marshall,
58,
p. 93) and which "seek the cause of
social
classes
entirely Vithin' the members of a class, in their psyche and values"
(Croner,
129,
p.
154).
Analogously, "objective" theories try "to
determine the basis of class exclusively by ^objective' data,
i.e., by
data which are given in the environment, the conditions of existence,
etc., of the members of classes" (Croner, 129, p. 148)
j such theories
"represent class as automatically determined by definite criteria, es-
pecially wealth and occupation" (Marshall, 58, p. 93).
Thus, this is
supposed to be a classification of theories of class according to the
determinant of social class j
it is asserted that this determinant can be
found
either within the individual
class members or
in conditions
outside them. At first sight, this distinction may appear plausible, but
upon closer inspection
it turns out to be both meaningless and mis-
leading.
Let us look
first
at the so-called "subjective"
theories.
Here,
classes are based on the psyche of individuals.
Croner quotes Centers,
for whom "class
.
.
.
can well be regarded as a psychological phe-
nomenon in the fullest sense of the term" (38, p. 27).
If, therefore,
a class exists anywhere, this means that people with common or similar
"psyches" and "values" have found each
other.
But why do they
have common "values"? Why do they have a common "class con-
sciousness"? There are two possible answers to these questions: either
this individual disposition is in fact an ultimate determinant—in which
case classes are, from a sociological point of view, random phenomena,
and there cannot be any theory of class 5
or the class consciousness,
the "psychology," is in itself a phenomenon generated by and explain-
able in terms of social structure—in which case there can be a theory
of class, but it is not "subjective."
It is only fair to add that for most
scholars classified as "subjectivists" psychic phenomena are in fact sec-
ondary or, which
is the same thing, socially structured.
Their de-
terminant of class is in reality not the individual but the social relations
in which he and others are involved.

----- Page 165 (native) -----
Sociological Critique of Marx
147
Are, then, all theories of class "objective"?
If by "objectivists"
we mean people who operate with
factors
like "wealth" or "con-
ditions of existence," we are dealing, as we know by now, not with
theorists of class but with theorists of stratification. But if "objective"
means no more than that class analysis is based on the study of con-
ditions of social structure, such as relations of authority, then the epi-
thet is meaningless for two reasons: first, it is hard to see what, if any-
thing, one says about social structure by calling it "objective" 5 second,
there never has been, and never can be, a theory of class which does
not proceed from extra-individual conditions of
social structure
to
their individual bearers.
Indeed, many of the classifiers formulate triumphantly what they
call "subjective-objective" concepts of class (thus Geiger, Marshall,
Croner, and others).
Theirs is a cheap triumph, for
it constitutes no
more than the solution of a self-made task. They could have saved
themselves, and us, many words by simply stating that, being soci-
ologists, they proposed to deal with their subject matter both in
its
structure and in the personnel of this structure. This statement might
have been a commonplace but it would have done less harm than the
endless discussion of the spurious problem of "subjectivism" and
"objectivism. "^°
(2) The alternative problem whether classes are generated "pri-
marily" by the structure of social roles or by the psyche of
their
incumbents reveals itself as a senseless construction.
If classes are a
legitimate subject of sociological analysis, their determinant must be
structural.
But there
is a genetic problem or, to be more careful, a
problem of correlation with respect
to the relation between
social
classes and the individual personalities of their members.
Class con-
sciousness, community of values, attitudes, "cultures," and behavior
patterns are no less important for the theory of class just because they
are assumed to be structured. We have to differentiate, here, between
the determinant of classes and their empirical character.
Empirically,
of course, classes consist of human individuals.
Even
if individuals
are members of classes only as incumbents of certain roles—i.e., with
a sector of their personalities—problems of attitude and behavior must
be raised. No theory of class can ignore them.
In particular
it will
^^ By way of qualification of this polemical conclusion
it
is only
fair to add that
there
is in fact a difference of emphasis among different theories of class.
Thus,
it
is
undoubtedly true that Marx has put less emphasis on the psychological aspects of class
action than Centers.
But this differential distribution of emphasis cannot justify any
inference as to the nature of class theory.

----- Page 166 (native) -----
148
Sociological Critique of Marx
be necessary to include in the formulation of such a theory certain
generalizations regarding the questions: {a) which motivational di-
rectives follow quasi-automatically from the incumbency of
social
roles relevant for class conflict (class interests), {b) under which con-
ditions these structured directives become conscious motives recog-
nized by the individual (class consciousness), and (c) by which addi-
tional common features of primarily psychological reality social classes
or some of their forms are characterized
(class culture).
All these
problems are closely allied with the systematic formulation of class
theory. We shall therefore have to deal with them in some detail
in the subsequent chapters.
(3) The problems of motivation and class behavior are evidently
closely connected with a further problem which we have encountered
repeatedly, most recently in the quotations at the beginning of this
section.
I mean the question : how permanent is an individual's mem-
bership in a class, and how permanent has it to be in order for classes
to persist and operate as such?
Here, sociologists hold widely diver-
gent opinions. Whereas for Renner "class position is almost without
exception lasting, comprising the whole life and the sequence of gen-
erations," for Schumpeter classes "never consist of the same family
individuals for any length of time."
This, too,
is a problem in the
personnel of social classes, the solution of which does not by any means
follow from the analysis of the structural determinant of class but
requires,
instead, an independent
investigation.
It touches on the
problem of social mobility of individuals within and between gen-
erations.
However,
as with the psychology of
social
classes,
their
stability and solidarity can adequately be dealt with only in the con-
text of the systematic exposition of class theory. We shall return to
this problem in the subsequent chapters of this study.
(4) However, the problem of the relation between individuals
and classes that underlies all others can be solved with the elements
assembled so far. On the one hand, classes are somehow based on a
structural arrangement of social roles j on the other hand, they con-
sist of persons. How do these two get together? How are social classes
recruited? How does the individual become a member of a class? Are
people born into classes, or do they acquire membership by achieve-
ment?
These questions, which appear without fail in any analysis of
social structure, refer to the problem of role allocation or of the re-
cruitment of the personnel for social roles. They can be answered by
analogy to general sociological procedure.
Class conflict results ulti-
mately from the
distribution of authority
in
social
organizations.

----- Page 167 (native) -----
Sociological Critique of Marx
149
Classes are based on the differences in legitimate power associated with
certain positions,
i.e., on the structure of social roles with respect to
their authority expectations.
It follows from this that an individual
becomes a member of a class by playing a social role relevant from
the point of view of authority.^**
Since any role in any social organi-
zation coordinated by authority
is relevant in this sense, and since,
further, every individual belongs at least to political society, every
individual belongs by virtue of such membership to at least one class.
He belongs to a class because he occupies a position in a social organi-
zation}
i.e., class membership
is derived from the incumbency of a
social role.
In this sense the criterion of allocation of individuals and
classes is subordinated to the criterion of the allocation of individuals
and authority roles. The question "How does the individual become
a member of the working class?" can be reduced to "How does he
become a worker?"
If Schumpeter states in general that the individual "is born into
a certain class position," this statement is as a general proposition false.
The individual
is born into a class position only in societies in which
he is born into a position endowed with or deprived of authority.
If
participation in governmental functions, or exclusion from these,
is
hereditary, class membership, too, is hereditary.
If, on the other hand,
admission to positions of authority
is based on individual ability or
achievement,
class membership,
too,
is
achieved.
The
industrial
worker who, by virtue of a law, is elected an executive of an industrial
enterprise thereby changes both
his authority position and
his
(in-
dustrial)
class membership.
The principle of recruitment
to social
classes must respond to the relevant social structures. The determi-
nation of class
is therefore a task of empirical inquiry and cannot be
made in general 5
it can be made only for specific societies.
With some qualifications, this conclusion also holds for the ques-
tion whether the "physical person" or the family (the "effective kin-
ship unit")
is the "true individual" of a social class.
This question
cannot be decided in general either j
it is meaningful only in the con-
text of specific arrangements of social structure.
In a society in which
the wife, children, and possibly even other relatives of an entrepre-
neur "borrow" their entire social position from him, can replace him
in it, and share his social position in this sense at least potentially, the
(extended) family is indeed the "individual" of a class. But if social
^^ In the next chapter, this statement will be qualified by the distinction between
quasi-groups and
interest groups.
Properly speaking,
the
present
analysis holds
for
quasi-groups only;
interest groups presuppose additional
factors.

positions are fundamentally individualized, if wife and children of
a manager can make no claim to his position when he retires or dies,
then the "physical person" is also the individual of the class, and
it
is therefore possible for members of the same family to belong not
only to different classes (classes generated by different imperatively
coordinated
associations)
but,
indeed,
to opposing
classes
(classes
opposed within the same association). The manifold empirical types
of class will become more apparent in the course of our investiga-
tion j criteria of recruitment give an indication of their possible dif-
ferentiation.
THE CONCEPT AND THEORY OF CLASS
Several early German sociologists have carried on a passionate
debate about a problem which is not dissimilar to that of "subjectivist"
and
"objectivist" theories of
class and has
in
fact
explicitly been
identified with
this problem by Geiger.
This problem, too, relates
to the concept of class and was always formulated as an alternative:
Are classes a "real phenomenon" {Realfh'dnomen) or a "theoretical
phenomenon" ( Ordnungsfh'dnomen) ? Are they realities or construc-
tions of science? "The term class," Geiger says (91, p. 2), "occurs on
the one hand as the abstract of men of one type^ and on the other hand
as the concept of a ^o/Z^^j/m/y.
.
.
.
In the first case men are classified
on the basis of certain characteristics or sets of characteristics ['theoreti-
cal phenomenon*—R.D.] .... The concept of class as a collectivity
has a different origin.
.
.
.
Class in this sense is the concept of a social
entity which as such involves a specific goal and intention, is the con-
cept of a specific totality" ['real phenomenon'—R.D.]
. Even before
Geiger, Schumpeter had introduced a similar distinction between class
as a "particular social creature which acts and suffers as such and wants
to be understood as such" ['real phenomenon'] and class in the sense
of "orders of pluralities according to certain characteristics.
Under-
stood in this sense class is a creature of the scientist and owes its ex-
istence to
his ordering hand"
['theoretical phenomenon']
(27, pp.
149 f.).^^ Both Geiger and Schumpeter emphatically decide in favor
of an understanding of class as a "real phenomenon" and relegate the
"theoretical phenomenon" to a lower level of analysis. But both have
overlooked the fact that they have fallen victim, here, to a false prob-
lem much like the classifiers of "subjectivism" and "objectivism."
The concept of class as described so far in this study has, indeed,
^^ The same "problem"
reappears
in some
recent American
discussions of the
sociolog/ of class, for which cf. Lenski (54).

two distinct aspects. On the one hand, we have dealt with classes as
effective forces in social conflicts, even as organized groupings carry-
ing on such conflicts. As such, classes are obviously "real phenomena,"
i.e., empirically identifiable "social entities" or "creatures." On the
other hand, we have derived classes from positions in associations co-
ordinated by authority and defined them by the "characteristic" of
participation in or exclusion from the exercise of authority.
In this
sense, classes are evidently "theoretical phenomena," "creatures of the
scientist," and not organized groupings.
There can be no doubt that
there is a difference between these two "definitions." But
is
it neces-
sary to decide in favor of one or the other of these "definitions"? Are
they really mutually exclusive alternatives.?
These questions can be
answered in the afiirmative only if one is concerned not with a theory
of class but merely with the formulation of a descriptive category.
Whoever answers it in the affirmative thereby explicitly renounces the
development of a theory of class.
As with the case of alternative "subjective" or "objective" con-
cepts, the fallacy of the problem derives from the fact that what
is
basically an analytical or genetic problem
is projected, so to speak,
from the third into the second dimension and thereby falsely creates
what appears to be a logical alternative. One can contrast a caterpillar
and a butterfly and state triumphantly that they are different, but then
one must not be surprised to find that a "two-dimensional" treatment
of this kind does not permit the question as to whether the one may
have developed out of the other.
In the case of classes, no problem of
genesis in this real sense is involved, but we do find an analogous situa-
tion on the level of analysis. One may of course confine oneself to
describing the "real phenomenon" and the "theoretical phenomenon"
of class as an "alternative of formal-logical possibilities" (Geiger, 91,
p. 2).
But if one does so,
it
is no longer possible to ask whether the
structural analysis of the one requires the assumption of the other.
Analyses, explanations, theories are always "creatures of the scientist,"
and this holds for their elements, too. But can this be regarded as an
objection?
Is it not rather the very point and substance of all science
to explain "real phenomena" in terms of "theoretical phenomena" by
dissecting the living richness of the one with the tools of the other and
reconstructing it on the level of theory?
Schumpeter and Geiger were indeed on doubtful ground not only
in constructing an artificial alternative, but also in deciding uncondi-
tionally for one of its sides.
Their choice can at best be accepted and
considered as a methodological principle, but even as such
it
is not

----- Page 170 (native) -----
152
Sociological Critique of Marx
justifiable.
It may be useful to start the formulation of theories by
considering real problems instead of by constructing "reality" out of
the skies of theory;
it may be sensible to derive the general from the
particular, instead of starting with the general. However, reasonable
as this procedure may be from the point of view of the psychology of
scientific discovery, it is erroneous to derive from it a principle of the
logic of scientific discovery.
Logically, at least, a theory takes prece-
dence over a hypothesis, a hypothesis over a descriptive statement.
Moreover,
it
is empirically of no consequence for the validity of a
theory whether it be formulated with a view to one, ten, or a hundred
"real phenomena" or, indeed, independent of these in abstracto. What
matters, rather, is whether and how a theory illuminates its proper area
of reality, and whether empirical processes refute the hypothesis de-
rived from the theory.
Many of the considerations of this chapter were concerned with
the determinant and context of the concept of class.
It was necessary,
first of all, to clarify the most important prerequisites of a sociological
theory of class. But as an isolated category the concept of class is mean-
ingless even for purely descriptive purposes. The statement that the
managers or bureaucrats of industry constitute an industrial class
is
more than a mere designation, an empty quid -pro quoy only if "class"
is not merely a defined term but a category embedded in a theory.
Concept and theory of class are inseparably connected. For this reason,
the considerations of this chapter have been more than a mere dis-
cussion or definition of the concept of class; at every stage they pointed
beyond the category of class into the field of class theory.
Before we
embark on a systematic discussion of this theory,
it seems appropriate
to try and delimit its field a little.
Class theory is concerned with the systematic explanation of that
particular form of structure-changing conflict which
is carried on by
aggregates or groups growing out of the authority structure of social
organizations.
The general theory of
class precedes the empirical
analysis of given societies in terms of class in that it states the under-
lying regularities of class conflict in a form that in principle allows ap-
plication to all societies. But the following formulation of the theory
of class does not claim universal applicability, for such applicability is
always subject to the test of empirical research;
it is confined, instead,
to that type of society which we have described as industrial society.
Its extension to other types of society may be possible and will in fact
be suggested
at several
points;
but
a thorough
discussion of
class
theory on this most general level falls outside the limits of the present
investigation.

----- Page 171 (native) -----

153
The general theory of class consists of two analytically separable
elements: the theory of class formation and the theory of class action,
or class conflict.
Schumpeter does not sufficiently recognize this dis-
tinction if he differentiates between the problems of the "essence of
the phenomenon," "class association," "class formation," and the "con-
crete causes and conditions of an individually
specific,
historically
given class structure" (27, p. 151). By the "problem of essence" he
seems to understand, above all, the problem of definition, which is pre-
liminary from the point of view of class theory. The problems of
"class association" ("How and why do classes hang together?") and
"class formation" ("How do classes originate?") belong together and
will here be dealt with under the one heading of class formation. The
problem of concrete empirical conditions of given class structures
is
part of the theory of class only by privation:
the theory must make
clear where its general propositions must be supplemented with em-
pirical
observations and where only empirical
generalizations, not
"laws" or postulates, are possible. Schumpeter does not even formu-
late the important problem of the regularities of class conflict and the
relations between classes.^*
The theory of class formation—which will be dealt with in Chap-
ter V—is concerned with the question of analyzing the "genesis" of
social classes. The theory must establish relations which connect the
specific "real phenomenon" class by way of the "theoretical phenome-
non" class with patterns of social structure, and in this sense derive
social classes from social structure.
This
is evidently a problem of
genesis, but it will prove useful to use this word in quotes. The ana-
lytical reduction ("explanation") of social classes to structural condi-
tions cannot be understood
as an empirical generalization of what
actually happens in the emergence and formation of classes.
In mak-
ing a structural analysis of the class phenomenon we do not assert
that a given arrangement of structure "necessarily" results in the full
formation of organized classes, or that every step of analysis reflects
a factual stage of development in the history of given classes.
In so
far as the theory of class formation is a scientific theory, it can neither
presuppose, nor imply, nor give rise to empirical generalizations that
are usually of doubtful logical status.
The theory of class action^ or class conflict—which will be dealt
with in Chapter VI—is based on the theory of class formation. Its sub-
ject matter consists
in the general analytical elements of the inter-
^^ Evidently the reason for this omission
is that Schumpeter's concept of class
is in
fact—as we found above—a concept of social stratum.

relations between classes conceived as structural phenomena.
It is con-
cerned in particular with patterns of class conflict and the regulation
of class conflict. This aspect of the theory of class appears to come close
to the limits of the possibility of theoretical analysis.
It will indeed be
our task, here, to determine, in the light of class theory, the area and
types of variability of empirical
classes, class conflicts, and changes
caused by class conflict, and to define the points at which the theory of
class has to be supplemented by empirical generalizations.

Social Structure, Group
Interests, and
Conflict Groups
INTEGRATION AND VALUES VERSUS COERCION AND INTERESTS:
THE TWO FACES OF SOCIETY
Throughout the history of Western political thought, two views
of society have stood in
conflict.
Both these views are intended to
explain what has been, and will probably continue to be, the most
puzzling problem of social philosophy: how is it that human societies
cohere?
There
is one large and distinguished school of thought ac-
cording to which
social order results from a general agreement of
values, a consensus omnium- or volonte generale which outweighs all
possible or actual differences of opinion and interest.
There
is an-
other equally distinguished school of thought which holds that co-
herence and order in society are founded on force and constraint, on
the domination of some and the subjection of others. To be sure,
these views are not at all points mutually exclusive.
The Utopian
(as we shall call those who insist on coherence by consensus) does not
deny the existence of differences of interest j nor does the Rationalist
(who believes in coherence by constraint and domination) ignore such
agreements of value as are required for the very establishment of
force.
But Utopian and Rationalist alike advance claims of primacy
for their respective standpoints.
For the Utopian, differences of in-
terest are subordinated to agreements of value, and for the Rationalist
these agreements are but a thin, and as such ineffective, coating of
the primary reality of differences that have to be precariously recon-
ciled by constraint. Both Utopians and Rationalists have shown much
ingenuity and imagination in arguing for their respective points of
view. This has not, however, led them more closely together. There
is a genuine conflict of approach between Aristotle and Plato, Hobbes
and Rousseau, Kant and Hegel, and
this
conflict has grown
in
in-
tensity as the history of thought has advanced.
Unless one believes
that all philosophical disputes are spurious and ultimately irrelevant,

----- Page 176 (native) -----
158
Social Structurey Grouf Interestsy Conflict Groups
the long history of the particular dispute about the problem of social
order has exposed—if not solved—what appear to be fundamental
alternatives of knowledge, moral decision, and political orientation.
Conflicting philosophical positions must inevitably, it seems to me,
reappear constantly in theories of science.
Even
if this should not
generally be the case, I would claim that the philosophical alternative
of a Utopian or a Rational solution of the problem of order pervades
modern
sociological thinking even
in
its remotest
manifestations.
Here, as elsewhere, philosophical positions do not enter into scien-
tific theories unchanged.
Here, as elsewhere, they pass through the
filter of logical supposition before they become relevant for testable
explanations of problems of experience.
The sociological Utopian
does not claim that order is based on a general consensus of values, but
that it can be conceived of in terms of such consensus, and that, if
it
is conceived of in these terms, certain propositions follow which are
subject to the test of specific observations.
Analogously, for the so-
ciological Rationalist the assumption of the coercive nature of social
order is a heuristic principle rather than a judgment of fact. But this
obvious reservation does not prevent the Utopians and the Rational-
ists of sociology from engaging
in disputes which
are hardly
less
intense
(if often rather less imaginative and ingenious) than those
of their philosophical antecedents. The subject matter of our concern
in this study demands that we take a stand with respect to this dispute.
Twice in our earlier considerations we have been faced with dif-
ferences
in the image of society—as
I then called
it—which
cor-
respond very closely to the conflicting views of Utopians and Ra-
tionalists.
I have tried to show that, at least in so far as historical
societies are concerned, Marx subscribed to an image of society of
the Rational variety. He assumed the ubiquity of change and conflict
as well as domination and subjection, and
I suggest that
this view
seems particularly appropriate for the analysis of problems of con-
flict.
In any case,
it seems more appropriate than the Utopian view
implicit in the works of Drucker and Mayo, according to which happy
cooperation is the normal state of social life.
Marx, or Drucker and
Mayo, may not be
especially convincing representatives
of
these
views,^ but the distinction with which we are concerned here
is,
in
^ This would be true, of course, for rather difTerent reasons.
Drucker and Mayo
are rather lacking in subtlety, and
it
is therefore too easy
to polemicize against their
positions. Marx, on the other hand,
is certainly subtle, but his notions of the "original"
and the "terminal"
societies of (imaginary)
history demonstrate
that he was but a
limited Rationalist with strong Utopian leanings.
Such mixtures of views really quite
incompatible are in fact not rare in the history of social thought.

any case, not tied to their names.
Generally speaking,
it seems to me
that two (meta-) theories can and must be distinguished in contem-
porary sociology. One of these, the integration theory of society , con-
ceives of social structure in terms of a functionally integrated system
held in equilibrium by certain patterned and recurrent processes. The
other one, the coercion theory of society ^ views social structure as a
form of organization held together by force and constraint and reach-
ing continuously beyond itself in the sense of producing within itself
the forces that maintain
it in an unending process of change.
Like
their philosophical counterparts, these theories are mutually exclu-
sive. But—if I may be permitted a paradoxical formulation that will
be explained presently—in sociology
(as opposed to philosophy)
a
decision which accepts one of these theories and rejects the other
is
neither necessary nor desirable. There are sociological problems for
the explanation of which the integration theory of society provides
adequate assumptions j
there are other problems which can be ex-
plained only in terms of the coercion theory of society j there are,
finally, problems for which both theories appear adequate. For socio-
logical analysis, society is Janus-headed, and its two faces are equiva-
lent aspects of the same reality.
In recent years, the integration theory of society has clearly domi-
nated sociological thinking.
In my opinion, this prevalence of one
partial view has had many unfortunate consequences.
However,
it
has also had at least one agreeable consequence, in that the very one-
sidedness of this theory gave rise to critical objections which enable
us today to put this theory in its proper place.
Such objections have
been stimulated with increasing frequency by the works of the most
eminent sociological theorist of integration, Talcott Parsons.
It is not
necessary here to attempt a comprehensive
exposition of Parsons'
position J nor do we have to survey the sizable literature concerned
with a critical appraisal of this position. To be sure, much of this
criticism
is inferior in subtlety and insight to Parsons' work, so that
it is hardly surprising that the sociological climate of opinion has re-
mained almost unaffected by Parsons' critics. There is one objection
to Parsons' position, however, which we have to examine if we are
to make a systematic presentation of a theory of group conflict.
In a
remarkable essay, D. Lockwood claims "that Parsons' array of con-
cepts is heavily weighted by assumptions and categories which relate
to the role of normative elements in social action, and especially to
the processes whereby motives are structured normatively to ensure
social stability. On the other hand, what may be called the substratum
of social action, especially as
it conditions interests which are produc-

tive of social conflict and instability, tends to be ignored as a general
determinant of the dynamics of social systems" (210, p. 136). Lock-
wood's claim touches on the core of our problem of the two faces of
society—although his formulation does not, perhaps, succeed in ex-
posing the problem with suflicient clarity.
It is certainly true that the work of Parsons displays a conspicuous
bias in favor of analysis in terms of values and norms.
It
is equally
true that many of those who have been concerned with problems of
conflict rather than of stability have tended to emphasize not the nor-
mative but the institutional aspects of social structure. The work of
Marx
is a case in point.
Probably, this difference in emphasis
is no
accident.
It is nevertheless as such irrelevant to an understanding of
or adoption of the alternative images of society which pervade po-
litical thought and sociological theory. The alternative between "nor-
mative elements in social action" and a factual "substratum of social
action," which Lockwood takes over from the work of Renner, in
fact indicates two levels of the analysis of social structure which are
in no way contradictory. There
is no theoretical reason why Talcott
Parsons should not have supplemented
(as indeed he occasionally
does) his analysis of normative integration by an analysis of the in-
tegration of social systems in terms of their institutional substratum.
However we look at social structure,
it always presents itself as com-
posed of a moral and a factual, a normative and an institutional, level
or, in the doubtful terms of Marx, a superstructure and a substratum.
The investigator
is free to choose which of these levels he wants to
emphasize more strongly—although he may be well-advised, in the
interest of clarity as well as of comprehensiveness of his analysis, not
to stress one of these levels to the exclusion of the other.
At the same time, there
is an important element of genuine cri-
tique in Lockwood's objection to Parsons, When Lockwood contrasts
stability and instability, integration and conflict, equilibrium and dis-
equilibrium, values and interests, he puts his flnger on a real alter-
native of thought, and one of which Parsons has apparently not been
sufficiently aware.
For of two equivalent models of society. Parsons
has throughout his work recognized only one, the Utopian or inte-
gration theory of society.
His "array of concepts"
is therefore in-
capable of coping with those problems with which Lockwood
is con-
cerned in his critical essay, and which constitute the subject matter
of the present study.
For purposes of exposition
it seems useful to reduce each of the
two faces of society to a small number of basic tenets, even
if this

involves some degree of oversimplification as well as overstatement.
The integration theory of society, as displayed by the work of Par-
sons and other structural-functionalists,
is founded on a number of
assumptions of the following type:
(1)
Every society
is a relatively persistent, stable structure of ele-
ments.
(2)
Every society is a well-integrated structure of elements.
(3)
Every element in a society has a function,
i.e., renders a contri-
bution to its maintenance as a system.
(4)
Every functioning
social
structure
is based on a consensus
of
values among its members.
In varying forms, these elements of (i)
stability, (2)
integration,
(3) functional coordination, and (4) consensus recur in all structural-
functional approaches to the study of social structure. They are, to
be sure, usually accompanied by protestations to the effect that sta-
bility,
integration,
functional coordination, and consensus are only
"relatively" generalized. Moreover, these assumptions are not meta-
physical propositions about the essence of society 5 they are merely
assumptions for purposes of scientific analysis. As such, however, they
constitute a coherent view of the social process' which enables us to
comprehend many problems of social reality.
However,
it is abundantly clear that the integration approach to
social analysis does not enable us to comprehend all problems of social
reality.
Let us look at two undeniably sociological problems of the
contemporary world which demand explanation.
( i ) In recent years,
an increasing number of industrial and commercial enterprises have
introduced the position of personnel manager to cope with matters
of hiring and firing, advice to employees, etc. Why?
And: what are
the consequences of the introduction of this new position?
(2) On
the
1 7th of June, 1953, the building workers of East Berlin put down
their tools and went on a strike that soon led to a generalized revolt
against the Communist regime of East Germany. Why?
And: what
are the consequences of this uprising? From the point of view of the
integration model of society, the first of these problems is susceptible
' It
is important to emphasize that "stability" as a tenet of the integration theory
of society does not mean that societies are "static."
It means, rather, that such processes
as do
occur
(and
the
structural-functional
approach
is
essentially
concerned
with
processes) serve to maintain the patterns of the system as a whole.
Whatever criticism
I have
of
this approach,
I
do
not want
to
be misunderstood
as
attributing
to
it
a
"static bias" (which has often been held against this approach without
full considera-
tion of its merits).

----- Page 180 (native) -----
1 62

of a satisfactory solution. A special position to cope with personnel
questions
is functionally required by large enterprises in an age of
rationalization and "social ethic" j
the introduction of this position
adapts the enterprise
to the values of the surrounding society j
its
consequence is therefore of an integrative and stabilizing nature. But
what about the second problem?
Evidently, the uprising of the 17th
of June is neither due to nor productive of integration in East Ger-
man society.
It documents and produces not stability, but instability.
It contributes to the disruption, not the maintenance, of the existing
system.
It testifies to dissensus rather than consensus. The integra-
tion model tells us little more than that there are certain "strains"
in the "system."
In fact, in order to cope with problems of this kind
we have to replace the integration theory of society by a different
and, in many ways, contradictory model.
What
I have called the coercion theory of society can also be
reduced to a small number of basic tenets, although here again these
assumptions oversimplify and overstate the case:
(1)
Every society
is at every point subject to processes of change
j
social change
is ubiquitous.
(2)
Every
society
displays
at every
point
dissensus and
conflict
j
social conflict is ubiquitous.
(3)
Every element in a society renders a contribution to
its disinte-
gration and change.
(4)
Every society
is based on the coercion of some of
its members
by others.
If we return to the problem of the German workers' strike,
it will
become clear that this latter model enables us to deal rather more
satisfactorily with
its causes and consequences.
The revolt of the
building workers and their fellows in other industries can be explained
in terms of coercion.^ The revolting groups are engaged in a conflict
which "functions" as an agent of change by disintegration. A ubiqui-
tous phenomenon is expressed, in this case, in an exceptionally intense
and violent way, and further explanation will have to account for
this violence on the basis of the acceptance of conflict and change as
universal features of social life.
I need hardly add that, like the in-
tegration model, the coercion theory of society constitutes but a set
of assumptions for purposes of scientific analysis and implies no claim
^ For purposes of clarity,
1 have
deliberately chosen an example from
a
totali-
tarian state.
But coercion
is meant here in a very general sense, and the coercion model
is applicable to all societies, independent of their specific political structure.

----- Page 181 (native) -----

163
for philosophical validity—although, like its counterpart, this model
also provides a coherent image of social organization.
Now, I would claim that, in a sociological context, neither of these
models can be conceived as exclusively valid or applicable. They con-
stitute complementary, rather than alternative, aspects of the struc-
ture of total societies as well as of every element of this structure.
We have to choose between them only for the explanation of specific
problems J but in the conceptual arsenal of sociological analysis they
exist side by side. Whatever criticism one may have of the advocates
of one or the other of these models can therefore be directed only
against claims for the exclusive validity of either.*
Strictly speakdng,
both models are "valid" or, rather, useful and necessary for socio-
logical analysis. We cannot conceive of society unless we realize the
dialectics of stability and change, integration and conflict, function and
motive force, consensus and coercion.
In the context of this study,
I regard this point as demonstrated by the analysis of the exemplary
problems sketched above.
It is perhaps worth emphasizing that the thesis of the two faces
of social structure does not require a complete, or even partial, re-
vision of the conceptual apparatus that by now has become more or
less generally accepted by sociologists in all countries.
Categories like
role, institution, norm, structure, even function are as useful in terms
of the coercion model as they are for the analysis of social integration.
In fact, the dichotomy of aspects can be carried through all levels of
sociological analysis j that is, it can be shown that, like social structure
itself, the notions of role and institution, integration and function,
norm and substratum have two faces which may be expressed by two
terms, but which may also in many cases be indicated by an extension
of concepts already in use.
"Interest and value," Radcliffe-Brown
once remarked, "are correlative terms, which refer to the two sides
of an asymmetrical relation" (221, p. 199). The notions of interest
and value indeed seem to describe very well the two faces of the
normative superstructure of society: what appears as a consensus of
values on the basis of the integration theory can be regarded as a
conflict of interests in terms of the coercion theory.
Similarly, what
* This,
it seems to me,
is the only— if fundamental—legitimate criticism that can
be raised against Parsons' work on
this general level.
In The Social System, Parsons
repeatedly advances, for the integration theory of society, a claim that
it
is the nucleus
of "the general" sociological theory—a claim which I regard as utterly unjustified.
It
is Lockwood's main concern also, in the essay quoted above, to reject this claim to uni-
versal validity.

----- Page 182 (native) -----
1 64

appears on the level of the factual substratum as integration from the
point of view of the former model presents itself as coercion or con-
straint from the point of view of the latter. We shall presently have
occasion to explore these two
faces of societies and their elements
rather more thoroughly with reference to the two categories of power
and of role.
While logically feasible,^ the solution of the dilemma of political
thought which we have offered here for the more restricted field of
sociological analysis nevertheless raises a number of serious problems.
It
is evidently virtually impossible to think of society in terms of
either model without positing its opposite number at the same time.
There can be no conflict, unless this conflict occurs within a context
of meaning, i.e., some kind of coherent "system." No conflict is con-
ceivable between French housewives and Chilean chess players, be-
cause these groups are not united by, or perhaps "integrated into," a
common frame of reference.
Analogously, the notion of integration
makes little sense unless it presupposes the existence of different ele-
ments that are integrated. Even Rousseau derived his volonte gene-
rale from a modified helium omnium contra omnes. Using one or the
other model
is therefore a matter of emphasis rather than of funda-
mental difference J and there are, as we shall see, many points at which
a theory of group conflict has to have recourse to the integration theory
of social structure.
Inevitably, the question will be raised,
also, whether a unified
theory of society that includes the tenets of both the integration and
the coercion models of society is not at least conceivable—for as to its
desirability there can be
little doubt.
Is there, or can there be, a
general point of view that synthesizes the unsolved dialectics of in-
tegration and coercion?
So far as I can see, there
is no such general
model; as to its possibility, I have to reserve judgment.
It seems at
least conceivable that unification of theory
is not feasible at a point
which has puzzled thinkers ever
since the beginning of Western
philosophy.
For the explanation of the formation of conflict groups out of
conditions of social structure, we shall employ a model that empha-
sizes the ugly face of society.
In the following sections of this chap-
° As
is demonstrated most clearly by the
fact that a similar situation can be en-
countered in physics with respect to the theory of light.
Here, too, there are two seem-
ingly incompatible theories which nevertheless exist side by side, and each of which
has its proper realm of empirical phenomena:
the wave theory and the quantum theory
of light.

ter I shall try to show how, on the assumption of the coercive nature
of social structure, relations of authority become productive of clashes
of role interest which under certain conditions lead to the formation
of organized antagonistic groups within limited social organizations
as well as within total societies. By proceeding step by step along these
lines, we shall eventually be in a position to contrast the rudiments
of a sociological theory of group conflict with such earlier approaches
as have been discussed in the
first part of this study, and to decide
whether the category of
class
is
still
a useful
tool of sociological
analysis.
POWER AND AUTHORITY
From the point of view of the integration theory of social struc-
ture, units of social analysis ("social systems") are essentially volun-
tary associations of people who share certain values and set up insti-
tutions
in order
to ensure the smooth functioning of cooperation.
From the point of view of coercion theory, however, the units of
social analysis present an altogether different picture.
Here,
it
is not
voluntary cooperation or general consensus but enforced constraint
that makes social organizations cohere.
In
institutional terms,
this
means that in every social organization some positions are entrusted
with a right to exercise control over other positions in order to ensure
effective coercion;
it means, in other words, that there is a differential
distribution of power and authority.
One of the central theses of
this study consists in the assumption that this differential distribution
of authority invariably becomes the determining factor of systematic
social conflicts of a type that
is germane to class conflicts in the tra-
ditional (Marxian) sense of this term. The structural origin of such
group
conflicts must be sought
in the arrangement of
social
roles
endowed with expectations of domination or subjection.
Wherever
there are such roles, group conflicts of the type in question are to be
expected.
Differentiation of groups engaged in such conflicts follows
the lines of differentiation of roles that are relevant from the point
of view of
the
exercise
of
authority.
Identification
of
variously
equipped authority roles is the first task of conflict analysis j" concep-
^ To facilitate communication,
I shall employ in this study a number of abbrevia-
tions.
These must not however be misunderstood.
Thus,
"conflict
analysis''
in
this
context stands for "analysis of group conflicts of the
class type,
class being understood
in the traditional sense."
At no point do
I want
to imply
a claim
for
a generalized
theory of social conflict.

tually and empirically all further steps of analysis follow from the
investigation of distributions of power and authority.
"Unfortunately, the concept of power
is not a settled one in the
social sciences, either in political science or in sociology" (Parsons,
201, p.
139). Max Weber (33), Pareto
(25), Mosca (24), later
Russell (203), Bendix (126), Lasswell (200), and others have ex-
plored some of the dimensions of this category; they have not, how-
ever, reached such a degree of consensus as would enable us to employ
the categories of power and authority without at least brief concep-
tual preliminaries. So far as the terms "power" and "authority" and
their distinction are concerned, I shall follow in this study the useful
and well-considered definitions of Max Weber.
For Weber, power
is the "probability that one actor within a social relationship will be
in a position to carry out his own will despite resistance, regardless of
the basis on which this probability rests" 3 whereas authority (Herr-
schaft)
is the "probability that a command with a given specific con-
tent will be obeyed by a given group of persons" (33^, p. 28). The
important difference between power and authority consists in the fact
that whereas power is essentially tied to the personality of individuals,
authority
is always associated with
social
positions or
roles.
The
demagogue has power over the masses to whom he speaks or whose
actions he controls j but the control of the officer over his men, the
manager over his workers, the civil servant over his clientele
is au-
thority, because it exists as an expectation independent of the specific
person occupying the position of officer, manager, civil servant.
It
is
only another way of putting this difference if we say—as does Max
Weber—that while power
is merely a factual relation, authority
is
a legitimate relation of domination and subjection.
In
this sense,
authority can be described as legitimate power.
In the present study we are concerned exclusively with relations
of authority, for these alone are part of social structure and therefore
permit the systematic derivation of group conflicts from the organi-
zation of total societies and associations within them. The significance
of such group conflicts rests with the fact that they are not the product
of structurally fortuitous relations of power but come forth wherever
authority
is exercised—and that means in all societies under all his-
torical
conditions.
( i ) Authority relations are always relations of
super- and subordination.
(2) Where there are authority relations,
the superordinate element
is socially expected to control, by orders
and commands, warnings and prohibitions, the behavior of the sub-
ordinate element.
(3) Such expectations attach to relatively perma-

----- Page 185 (native) -----
Social Structurey Group Interestsj Conflict Growps
167
nent social positions rather than to the character of individuals j they
are in this sense legitimate.
(4) By virtue of this fact, they always
involve
specification of the persons subject
to control and of
the
spheres within which control
is permissible/
Authority,
as
distinct
from power,
is never a relation of generalized control over others.
(5) Authority being a legitimate relation, noncompliance with au-
thoritative commands can be sanctioned j
it is indeed one of the func-
tions of the legal system (and of course of quasi-legal customs and
norms) to support the effective exercise of legitimate authority.
Alongside the term "authority," we shall employ (and have em-
ployed) in this study the terms "domination" and "subj ection." These
will be used synonymously with the rather clumsy expressions "en-
dowed with authority" or "participating in the exercise of authority"
(domination), and "deprived of authority" or "excluded from the
exercise of authority" (subjection).
It seems desirable for purposes of conflict analysis to specify the
relevant unit of social organization in analogy to the concept of social
system in the analysis of integration. To speak of specification here
is perhaps misleading.
"Social system"
is
a very general concept
applicable to all types of organization j and we shall want to employ
an equally general concept which differs from that of social system by
emphasizing a different aspect of the same organizations.
It seems to
me that Max Weber's category "imperatively coordinated association"
{Herrschaftsverband) serves this purpose despite its clumsiness.*
In conflict analysis we are concerned inter alia with the genera-
tion of conflict groups by the authority relations obtaining in impera-
tively coordinated associations.
Since imperative coordination, or au-
thority, is a type of social relation present in every conceivable social
"^ This element of the definition of authority
is crucial.
It implies that the man-
ager who tries to control people outside his firm, or the private lives of people
inside
his
firm,
trespasses the
borderline between
authority and power.
Although he
has
authority over people
in his firm, his control assumes the form of power as soon
as
it
goes beyond the
specified persons and spheres of legitimate
control.
This
type of
trespassing is of course frequent in every authority relation; and an empirical phenome-
non well worth investigating
is to what extent the fusion of authority and power tends
to intensify group conflicts.
* Parsons, in his translation of Weber's Wirtschajt und Gesdlschajt, suggests "im-
peratively coordinated group." Any translation of Weber's term
is bound to be some-
what awkward, but
it seems to me
that the word "group"
in
Parsons'
translation
is
false. Weber uses Verband, e.g., to describe the state, or a church—units of organiza-
tion which can hardly be called "groups."
"Association"
is probably as precise an Eng-
lish equivalent of Verband as
is likely to be found.

----- Page 186 (native) -----
1 68

organization, it will be sufficient to describe such organizations simply
as associations. Despite prolonged terminological discussions, no gen-
eral agreement has been attained by sociologists on the precise mean-
ing of the categories "organization," "association," and "institution."
If I am not mistaken in my interpretation of the trend of termino-
logical disputes,
it appears justifiable to use the term "association"
in such a way as to imply the coordination of organized aggregates
of roles by domination and subjection. The state, a church, an enter-
prise, but also a political party, a trade union, and a chess club are
associations in this sense.
In
all of them, authority relations exist;
for
all of them,
conflict
analysis
is therefore
applicable.
If
at
a
later
stage we
shall
suggest
restriction
to
the two
great
associa-
tions of the
state and the
industrial
enterprise,
this suggestion
is
dictated merely by considerations of empirical significance, not logi-
cal
(or definitional)
difference.
In looking at
social organizations
not in terms of their integration and coherence but from the point
of view of their structure of coercion and constraint, we regard them
as (imperatively coordinated)
associations rather than as social sys-
tems.
Because social organizations are also associations, they generate
conflicts of interest and become the birthplace of conflict groups.
I have assumed in the preceding remarks that authority is a char-
acteristic of social organizations as general as society itself. Despite the
assertion of Renner—and other modern sociologists—that
in some
contemporary societies the exercise of authority has been eliminated
and replaced by the more anonymous "rule of the law" or other non-
authoritative relations,
I should indeed maintain that authority
is a
universal element of social structure.
It
is in this sense more general
than, for example, property, or even
status.
With respect to post-
capitalist industrial society, I hope to establish this position more un-
ambiguously in the final chapters of this study.
Generally speaking,
however, the universality of authority relations would seem evident
as soon as we describe these relations in a "passive" rather than in an
"active" sense.
Authority relations exist wherever there are people
whose actions are subject to legitimate and sanctioned prescriptions
that originate outside them but within social structure. This formula-
tion, by leaving open who exercises what kind of authority, leaves little
doubt as to the omnipresence of some kind of authority somehow ex-
ercised.
For
it
is evident that there are many forms and types of
authority in historical societies. There are differences of a considerable
order of magnitude between the relations of the citizen of classical
Athens and his slaves, the feudal landlord and his villeins and serfs,
the nineteenth-century capitalist and his workers, the secretary of a

totalitarian state party and its members, the appointed manager of a
modern enterprise and its employees, or the elected prime minister of
a democratic country and the electorate. No attempt will be made
in this study to develop a typology of authority.
But
it
is assumed
throughout that the existence of domination and subjection is a com-
mon feature of all possible types of authority and, indeed, of all pos-
sible types of association and organization.
The notion of power and authority employed in the present study
represents what Parsons in a critical review of C. W. Mills's book on
the American power elite {62) calls the "zero-sum" concept of author-
ity. Parsons objects to this concept, and his argument provides a wel-
come opportunity to clarify our notion somewhat further and relate
it to the two models distinguished above.
"The
essential point
at
present
is that, to Mills [and of course to us in this study—R.D.],
power is not a facility for the performance of function in and on behalf
of the society as a system, but is interpreted exclusively as a facility for
getting what one group, the holders of power, wants by preventing
another group, the *outs,' from getting what it wants" (201, p. 139).
This statement is unobjectionable, and in so far as Mills really uses
power "exclusively" in the "zero-sum" sense, I should tend to agree
also with Parsons' critique.
But then Parsons continues, in the same
passage, to make the same mistake in the opposite direction, and to
make it deliberately and consideredly: "What this conception does is
to elevate a secondary and derived aspect of a total phenomenon into
the central place"
[italics mine]
. Not surprisingly, Parsons continues
to point out what is presumably the primary and original aspect of the
total phenomenon:
"It is the capacity to mobilize the resources of the
society for the attainment of goals for which a general 'public' commit-
ment has been made, or may be made.
It is mobilization, above all, of
the action of persons and groups, which is binding on them by virtue of
their position in the society" ( 20 1 , p.
1 40) . A clearer exposition of the
two faces of society, and of the untenable and dangerous one-sidechiess
of Parsons' position, is hardly conceivable.
It is certainly true that for many purposes of analysis, power or
as I should prefer to say—authority, both realizes and symbolizes the
functional integration of social systems. To use a pertinent illustra-
tion:
in many contexts, the elected president or prime minister of
democratic countries'* represents his country as a whole j
his position
^ This
illustration
is unambiguous with respect
to the president of the United
States.
Elsewhere,
the
representative and
the governmental
functions
are
usually
separated; in these cases
I mean not the head of state (king, president), but the chief of
government (prime minister, chancellor).

----- Page 188 (native) -----
1 70

expresses therefore the unity and integration of a nation.
In other
contexts, however, the chief of government
is but the representative
of the majority party, and therefore exponent of sectional interests.
I suggest that as in the position of the prime minister neither of these
elements is primary or secondary, thus neither the integrative nor the
disruptive aspect of authority in social analysis is primary or secondary.
Like all other elements of social structure, authority has two faces
those, so to speak, of Mills and of Parsons—and on the highest level
of abstraction it is illegitimate to emphasize either of these to the ex-
clusion of the other. Authority is certainly not only productive of con-
flict j but neither is it only (or even primarily) "a facility for the per-
formance of function in and on behalf of the society as a system."
If
we are concentrating in this study on what Parsons would
call the
"negative functions" of authority, we do so because this aspect is more
appropriate and useful for the analysis of structurally generated syste-
matic social conflicts.
In referring to the ugly face of authority as a "zero-sum" concept,
Parsons brings out one further aspect of this category which
is es-
sential for our considerations. By zero-sum, Parsons evidently means
that from the point of view of the disruptive "functions" of authority
there are two groups or aggregates of persons, of which one possesses
authority to the extent to which the other one is deprived of it.^° This
implies—for us,
if not for Parsons—that in terms of the coercion
theory of society we can always observe a dichotomy of positions in
imperatively coordinated associations with respect to the distribution
of authority.
Parsons, in his critique of Mills, compares the distribu-
tion of authority to the distribution of wealth.
It seems to me that
this comparison
is misleading.
However unequally wealth may be
distributed, there always
is a continuum of possession ranging from
the lowest to the highest rank. Wealth is not and cannot be conceived
as a zero-sum concept. With respect to authority, however, a clear line
can at least in theory be drawn between those who participate in
its
exercise in given associations and those who are subject to the authori-
tative commands of others. Our analysis of modern societies in later
chapters will show that empirically it is not always easy to identify the
^'^ There
is one implication of the expression "zero-sum" which would be con-
trary to my
thesis.
Mathematically,
it would be possible
for both groups
to have no
authority in the sense of a complete absence of authority.
I have argued above that
under
all conditions the authority of one aggregate
is, so
to speak, greater than zero,
and that of the other aggregate correspondingly smaller than zero. The presence of
authority, and
its unequal distribution, are universal features of social structure.

border line between domination and subjection.
Authority has not
remained unaffected by the modern process of division of labor.
But
even here, groups or aggregates can be identified which do not partici-
pate in the exercise of authority other than by complying with given
commands or prohibitions.
Contrary to all criteria of social stratifica-
tion, authority does not permit the construction of a scale.
So-called
hierarchies of authority (as displayed, for example, in organization
charts) are in fact hierarchies of the "plus-side" of authority, i.e., of
the differentiation of domination; but there
is, in every association,
also a "minus-side" consisting of those who are subjected to authority
rather than participate in its exercise.
In two respects this analysis has to be specified,
if not supple-
mented.
First, for the individual incumbent of roles, domination in
one association does not necessarily involve domination in all others
to which he belongs, and subjection, conversely, in one association does
not mean subjection in all. The dichotomy of positions of authority
holds for specific associations only.
In a democratic state, there are
both mere voters and incumbents of positions of authority such as
cabinet ministers, representatives, and higher civil servants.
But this
does not mean that the "mere voter" cannot be incumbent of a position
of authority in a different context, say, in an industrial enterprise ; con-
versely, a cabinet minister may be, in his church, a mere member, i.e.,
subject to the authority of others. Although empirically a certain cor-
relation of the authority positions of individuals in different associa-
tions seems likely, it is by no means general and is in any case a matter
of specific empirical conditions,
it is at least possible, if not probable,
that if individuals in a given society are ranked according to the sum
total of their authority positions in all associations, the resulting pat-
tern will not be a dichotomy but rather like scales of stratification ac-
cording to income or prestige. For this reason it is necessary to empha-
size that in the sociological analysis of group conflict the unit of analy-
sis
is always a
specific
association and the dichotomy of
positions
within
it.
As with respect to the set of roles associated with an individual,
total societies, also, do not usually present an unambiguously dicho-
tomic authority structure. There are a large number of imperatively
coordinated associations in any given society.
Within every one of
them we can distinguish the aggregates of those who dominate and
those who are subjected.
But since domination in industry does not
necessarily involve domination in the state, or a church, or other as-
sociations, total societies can present the picture of a plurality of com-

----- Page 190 (native) -----
172
Social Structure, Group Interests, Conflict Groups
peting dominant
(and,
conversely,
subjected)
aggregates.
This,
again, is a problem for the analysis of specific historical societies and
must not be confounded with the clearer lines of differentiation within
any one association.
Within the latter, the distribution of authority
always sums up to zero, i.e., there always is a division involving domi-
nation and subjection.
^^
I need hardly emphasize that from the point of view of "settling"
the concepts of power and authority, the preceding discussion has
raised more problems than it has solved.
I believe, however, that for
the purposes of this study, and of a sociological theory of conflict, little
needs to be added to what has been stated here.
In order somewhat
to substantiate this perhaps rather bold assertion,
it seems useful to
recapitulate briefly the heuristic purpose and logical status of the con-
siderations of this section.
I have introduced, as a structural determinant of conflict groups,
the category of authority as exercised in imperatively coordinated as-
sociations. While agreeing with Marx that source and level of income
—even socioeconomic status—cannot usefully be conceived as deter-
minants of conflict groups,
I have added to this list of erroneous ap-
proaches Marx's own in terms of property in the means of production.
Authority
is both a more general and a more significant social rela-
tion. The former has been shown in our critique of Marx; the latter
will have to be demonstrated by subsequent considerations and analy-
ses. The concept of authority is used, in this context, in a specific sense.
It is differentiated from power by what may roughly be referred to
as the element of legitimacy j and
it has to be understood throughout
in the restricted sense of authority as distributed and exercised in im-
peratively coordinated associations. While its "disruptive" or conflict-
generating consequences are not the only aspect of authority, they are
the one relevant in terms of the coercion model of society. Within the
frame of reference of this model,
( i ) the distribution of authority in
associations is the ultimate "cause" of the formation of conflict groups,
^^ Inevitably, the qualifications introduced
in the two preceding paragraphs are
rather vague
if stated merely in the abstract. They are, however, of the utmost im-
portance
for empirical
analysis.
By
strictly postulating imperatively coordinated
as-
sociations as units of conflict analysis, we are able
to consider,
e.g., the
relations be-
tween industry and society as an empirical problem which allows of varying solutions
in different historical contexts.
Similarly we can, by this emphasis, regard subjection
(and consequent deprivation)
in several associations as a condition strengthening and
intensifying
conflict, but by no means necessary
in
historical
situations.
These and
similar problems will become increasingly crucial as our investigation proceeds.

173
and (2), being dichotomous,
it
is, in any given association, the cause
of the formation of two, and only two, conflict groups.
The
first of these statements
is logically an assumption, since
it
underlies scientific theories.
It cannot as such be tested by observation j
its validity is proven, rather, by its usefulness for purposes of explana-
tion. We
shall derive from
this assumption
certain more
specific
hypotheses which, if refuted, would take the assumption with them
into the waste-paper basket of scientific theories. We assume in this
sense that if we manage to identify the incumbents of positions of
domination and subjection in any given association, we have identified
the contenders of one significant type of conflicts—conflicts which oc-
cur in this association at all times.
As to the second statement, the one concerned with the dichotomy
of authority positions in imperatively coordinated associations, it is not,
I suggest, either an assumption or an empirical hypothesis, but an
analytical statement.
It follows from and is implicit in the very con-
cept of authority that within specified contexts some have authority
and others not.
If either nobody or everybody had authority, the
concept would lose its meaning.
Authority implies both domination
and subjection, and
it therefore implies the existence of two distinct
sets of positions or persons. This is not to say, of course, that there is
no difference between those who have a great deal and those who have
merely a little authority. Among the positions of domination there
may be, and often is, considerable differentiation. But such differenti-
ation, while important for empirical analysis, leaves unaffected the
existence of a border line somewhere between those who have what-
ever little authority and the "outs."
Strictly speaking, an analytical
statement which states that there is a dichotomy of authority positions
is tautological j but as this example shows, there are tautologies which
are worth stating.
Having thus established the frame of reference and basic assump-
tions of a sociological theory of conflict, we now turn to its more spe-
cific elements—first with respect to the formation of conflict groups,
then with respect to patterns of conflicts between these groups.
LATENT AND MANIFEST INTERESTS
The analytical process of conflict group formation can be described
in terms of a model.
Throughout, the categories employed in this
model will be used in terms of the coercion theory of social structure.
With this restriction in mind, the thesis that conflict groups are based
on the dichotomous distribution of authority in imperatively coordi-

----- Page 192 (native) -----
1 74
Social Structure, Group Interests, Conflict Groups
nated associations can be conceived of as the basic assumption of the
model. To this assumption we now add the proposition that diflFeren-
tially equipped authority positions in associations involve, for their
incumbents, conflicting interests. The occupants of positions of domi-
nation and the occupants of positions of subjection hold, by virtue of
these positions, certain interests which are contradictory in substance
and direction.
In the case of incumbents of ruling positions, these in-
terests, being "ruling interests" themselves, might also be described
as values j however, in the present context I propose to retain the cate-
gory of interest as a general term for the orientation of dominating
and subjected aggregates.
By postulating interests that are given and conditioned by posi-
tions, we encounter once again a problem which we must now face
squarely.
In everyday language, the word "interest" signifies inten-
tions or directions of behavior associated with individuals rather than
with their positions.
It is not the position, but the individual who "is
interested in something," "has an interest in something," and "finds
something interesting."
It might indeed appear that the notion of in-
terest is not meaningfully conceivable other than in relation to human
individuals.
Interests would seem to be psychological in the strictest
sense. Yet the proposition of certain antagonistic interests conditioned
by, even inherent in, social positions contains precisely this apparently
meaningless assertion that there can be interests which are, so to say,
impressed on the individual from outside without his participation.
"As in private life we distinguish," says Marx, "between what a
man thinks and says of himself and what he really is and does, so must
we distinguish even more carefully in historical struggles the catch-
words and
fantasies of parties from their real organism and their
real interests, their conception from their reality" (8, p. 38).
Else-
where, Marx equates a "common situation" with "common interests"
(see 6, p. 187) and thereby shows that—as we do here—he bases his
theory on a quasi-"objective," nonpsychological concept of interest.
Geiger was the most extreme critic of such a concept. He regards it as
"questionable whether one can speak at all of interest in an objective
sense.
Interest
is
above
all
something
subjective
.
.
."
(46,
pp.
127 f.). He believes that the (Marxian) postulate of interests ex-
isting independently of individuals conceals a judgment "about the
true advantage of others," for which "one would evidently have to
possess an objective and universally valid scale of values" (p. 129).
Since such a scale "plainly does not exist,"
it
is not science that has
guided Marx's pen here, but pure speculation. He imputes, according

----- Page 193 (native) -----
Social Structurey Grou-p Interestsy Conflict Growps
175
to Geiger, "true interests" to the proletariat which are independent of
the wishes and goals of its members. But here "the proper analysis of
the
interest structure of social
classes ends—religious mania alone
speaks here" (p. 133).
I would agree that the postulate of nonindividual class interests
in its Marxian formulation requires criticism. But such criticism need
not be directed against the possibility of a nonpsychological concept
of interest. A concept of this kind responds, in fact, to a genuine need
of sociological analysis.
It is no accident that it appears and reappears
frequently in the history of sociology—after Marx, in the works of
Ratzenhofer, Small, Sumner, and many others. For L. Robbins, the
distinction between "subjective" and "objective communities of in-
terest" is the starting point of a critique of Marxj yet Robbins never
doubts the usefulness of the category of "objective community of
interest" (182,
p.
112).
M. Ginsberg refers to "aggregates
.
.
.
whose members have certain interests or modes of behavior in com-
mon" without being "definite groups" (47, p. 40). Even Parsons not
only frequently uses the clearly "objective" category of "vested in-
terests," but also explicitly emphasizes the existence of common "ide-
ologies" or "attitude systems" among those "who are structurally
placed at notably different points in a differentiated social structure,"
i.e., occupy identical or similar social positions (67, p. 330).
For purposes of the sociological analysis of conflict groups and
group
conflicts,
it
is necessary
to assume
certain
structurally gen-
erated orientations of the actions of incumbents of defined positions.
By analogy to conscious ("subjective") orientations of action,
it ap-
pears justifiable to describe these as "interests,"
It has to be empha-
sized, however, that by so doing no assumption
is implied about the
substance of these interests or the consciousness and articulate orienta-
tion of the occupants of the positions in question." The assumption of
"objective" interests associated with social positions has no psycho-
logical implications or ramifications 5
it belongs to the level of socio-
logical analysis proper.
In saying that the Marxian notion of class interest requires criti-
cism, I mean that Marx fuses, in this notion, generalization and spe-
cific empirical observation in an impermissible manner. This becomes
apparent if we look at the substance of socially structured interests.
What is it that the occupants of positions of domination or subjection
^^ This statement

Stricdy speaking,
it holds for latent interests only.

Social Structurey Grouf Interestsy Conflict Groups
are "interested in" by virtue of their positions?
Geiger is right in re-
jecting Marx's attempt to answer this question in terms of material
value conceptions.
That "the realization of a socialist society" con-
stitutes "the true interest of labor" is indeed an assertion for the (em-
pirical) premises of which "the proof
is missing" (46, pp. 130 f.).
An assumption of this kind cannot be introduced by way of a postulate.
The substance of socially structured "objective" interests can be de-
scribed only in highly formal terms:
they are interests in the main-
tenance or modification of a status quo. Our model of conflict group
formation involves the proposition
that of the two aggregates of
authority positions to be distinguished in every association, one—that
of domination—is characterized by an interest in the maintenance of
a social structure that for them conveys authority, whereas the other
that of subjection—involves an interest in changing a social condition
that deprives
its incumbents of authority. The two interests are in
conflict.
Max Weber has convincingly demonstrated that the problem of
maintaining or changing given
structures of authority can be ex-
pressed, both conceptually and empirically, in terms of the basis of
legitimacy of relations of authority. From our assumption of an at
least latent conflict of interests in every imperatively coordinated as-
sociation,
it follows that the legitimacy of authority must always be
precarious.
There always
is one aggregate of positions and their in-
cumbents which represents the institutionalized doubt in the legitimacy
of the status quo of the distribution of authority.
In this sense, the
proposition that there are "objective" interests in changing any given
structure of authority might also be expressed in terms of the poten-
tial illegitimacy of all relations of authority.
Empirically, group con-
flict is probably most easily accessible to analysis if it be understood as
a conflict about the legitimacy of relations of authority.
In every as-
sociation, the interests of the ruling group are the values that constitute
the ideology of the legitimacy of its rule, whereas the interests of the
subjected group constitute a threat to this ideology and the social re-
lations it covers.
There are two further ways of elucidating the important notion of
socially structured conflicts of interest. One of these has recourse to
what is, if not a general "psychological law," at least an assumption im-
plicit in many theories of economics, psychology, and sociology.
In a
word, this "law" might be described as the pleasure principle.
It might
be argued that the assumption of a fundamental human tendency to
improve the balance of pleasure and pain, or gratification and depriva-

177
tion, implies inter alia that wherever there is authority those in posi-
tions of domination would tend to defend their gratification, whereas
those in positions of subjection are forced to attack existing conditions
in order to remedy their deprivation/^
Plausible as this argument may sound,
it is both unnecessary and
somewhat misleading.
It is unnecessary because the proposition that
a conflict of interests is associated with authority positions in any as-
sociation requires no recourse to more general assumptions.
At the
same time, the argument is misleading not only because (since Freud)
we know that the pleasure principle is at best of restricted applicability,
but above all because it might suggest that the "objective" interests of
our model are after all psychological realities. Our proposition does
not imply that the incumbents of positions equipped with "objective"
interests will necessarily become conscious of these interests and act
accordingly.
While this may be probable,
it
is not as such required
by the model of conflict group formation."
I suggest, therefore, that a second line of argument is rather more
appropriate for elucidating the notion of "objective" interests.
This
has the additional advantage of enabling us to abandon the awkward
concept of "objective" interests in favor of more unambiguous and
precise notions.
In terms of the integration theory of society, social
positions, with which we are here concerned, are significant, above all,
as social roles. By roles are understood sets of role expectations, "pat-
terned expectations defining the proper behavior of persons playing
certain roles" (Parsons, 217, pp. 61 f.).
"Proper" means, of course,
within the frame of reference of integration theory, appropriate for
the functioning of the social system and contributing to its integration.
The notion of role expectations ascribes an orientation of behavior to
social positions or roles. The individual "player" of roles may or
may not internalize these role expectations and make them conscious
orientations of action.
If he does so, he
is in terms of integration
theory "adapted" or "adjusted" j
if he does not do so, he
is a "devi-
ant."
In any case, the assumption of certain "objective" expectations
of behavior proves analytically useful.
I suggest that the category of
^^ In several earlier essays (cf, 42, p. 42
; 206, p. 5 1 2 and note 8 1 )
,
I have in fact
argued along these
lines.
However, today
I would regard
this argument,
if not
as
false, then as misleading, and prefer the second approach indicated below.
^*Thus, the model does not prejudice the
(empirical)
problem of whether
in
any given case those
in subjection want to attack those
in domination or not.
Con-
scious motivations are, from the point of view of conflict theory, largely a matter of
empirical research.

----- Page 196 (native) -----
178
Social Structurey Grouf Interests^ Conflict Groups
interest in the coercion theory of society must be understood in strict
analogy to that of role expectation. The "objective" interests under
discussion are in fact role interests,
i.e., expected orientations of be-
havior associated with authority roles in imperatively coordinated as-
sociations.
Again, the individual incumbent of roles may or may not
internalize these expectations.
But in our context he behaves in an
"adapted" or "adjusted" manner if he contributes to the conflict of
contradictory interests rather than to the integration of a social system.
The individual who assumes a position in an association finds these role
interests with his position, just as he finds certain role expectations
from the point of view of the social system. For diflFerent purposes of
sociological analysis, different aspects of its basic unit—the position-
role—are relevant j
roles, too, have two faces.
In our context they
figure primarily as sets of expected interests within imperatively co-
ordinated associations.^^
For certain purposes of the theory of conflict group formation, it
will prove useful to replace the concept of role interests by another one
which makes its relation to the incumbents of authority positions even
more apparent.
Role interests are, from the point of view of the
"player" of roles, latent interestsy i.e., undercurrents of his behavior
which are predetermined for him for the duration of his incumbency
of a role, and which are independent of his conscious orientations. As
such they can, under conditions to be specified presently, become con-
scious goals which we shall correspondingly call manifest interests^^
By contrast to latent
interests, manifest interests are psychological
realities. They describe—as Geiger demands for all interests—"the
fact that emotion, will, and desire of a person are directed toward
some goal" (although we presuppose that this goal
is "some goal"
only in a substantial, not in a formal, sense)
. The specific substance of
manifest
interests can be determined only in the context of given
social conditions j but they always constitute a formulation of the is-
sues of structurally generated group conflicts of the type in question.
In this sense, manifest interests are the program of organized groups.
^^ The frultfulness of this necessarily rather abstract analysis can be demonstrated
only by empirical analysis.
For some indication of the
potentialities of the position
here suggested, cf. the discussion of codetermination in industry in Chapter VII.
^° These two terms which—apart from their evident meaning
as words—refer
back
to Merton's
distinction of "manifest" and
"latent
functions" and
further
to
Freud's categories of "manifest" and "latent dream contents," were
first proposed by
me in an essay on class (42, pp.
11
f.).
Some of the purely conceptual problems are
discussed at somewhat greater length in that essay.

The psychological formations which we have called "manifest
interests" are evidently similar to what in Marxian, and more gen-
erally in sociological, literature
is usually referred to as "class con-
sciousness." However, it is necessary to distinguish strictly the philo-
sophical and speculative elements of this concept as used, for example,
by Marx and Lukacs (21), from the observable articulate interests of
organized groups.
Class consciousness in the sense of manifest in-
terests is a "real category."
Its existence and substance can in principle
be discovered by interviews. The conception of a "false conscious-
ness" can, in the context of the categories here employed, be meaning-
ful only for manifest interests which are not adapted to the latent
interests underlying them j even then, it is a highly problematical con-
ception.
In terms of a scientific theory which
is supposed to explain
problems of reality, the statement that a large group of people thinks
"falsely" is plainly meaningless. "One has to be a philosopher of real
dialectics to be serious about such nonsense" (Geiger, 46, p.
114).
While latent interests are,
in a psychological sense, "nonexistent,"
manifest interests are always realities in the heads of the occupants
of positions of domination or subjection in associations.
It is the task
of the theory of class formation to establish a systematic connection
between the two categories of latent and manifest interests.
QUASI-GROUPS AND INTEREST GROUPS
(l): THEORETICAL CONDITIONS OF CONFLICT GROUP FORMATION
So far our discussion has left undecided the question as to what
kind of aggregates conflict groups are. We have established the de-
terminant of group conflicts in the sense of this study; we have also
established the categories characteristic of conflict groups on the nor-
mative level of analysis; but conflict groups are evidently not norma-
tive phenomena but real groupings which as such form part of the
substratum of society.
In describing these groupings, the categories
of quasi-group and interest group are essential.
We have postulated two conflicting orientations of latent interests
as characteristic of the role structure of imperatively coordinated as-
sociations. By implication, this means, of course, that the authority
positions equipped with expected interests as well as their incumbents
have at least one attribute in common.
In a significant sense, the oc-
cupants of identical authority positions,
i.e., either of positions of
domination or of positions of subjection, find themselves in a common
situation.
Being united by a common, potentially permanent, char-
acteristic, they are more than mere masses or incoherent quantities.

----- Page 198 (native) -----
i8o
Social Structurey Group Interestsy Conßict Groups
At the same time, the incumbents of like authority positions in an
association do not in any sociologically tenable sense constitute a group.
Just as all doctors, or all inhabitants of Berlin, do not as such constitute
social groups, the occupants of positions with identical latent interests
are not a group. For groups, a feeling of belongingness is as constitu-
tive as a minimum of organization j but both are explicitly not de-
manded by the concept of latent interests. The aggregates of incum-
bents of positions with identical role interests are at best a potential
group.
Following M. Ginsberg we shall use for this particular type
of social grouping the term quasi-grouf.
"Not all collectivities or
aggregates form groups. Groups are masses of people in regular con-
tact or communication, and possessing a recognizable structure. There
are other aggregates or portions of the community which have no
recognizable structure, but whose members have certain interests or
modes of behavior in common, which may at any time lead them to
form themselves into
definite groups.
To
this category of quasi-
groups belong such
entities
as
social
classes, which, without being
groups, are a recruiting field for groups, and whose members have
certain characteristic modes of behavior in common" (47, p. 40).
A note of caution
is required with respect to the "modes of be-
havior" included by Ginsberg in his definition of quasi-groups. The
constituent element of the type of quasi-groups with which we are
here concerned
is the community of certain latent interests.
Latent
interests are not psychological phenomena;
quasi-groups based on
them might therefore be called a mere theoretical construction. They
are "theoretical phenomena," i.e., units constructed for the purpose of
explaining problems of social conflict. They are, as Ginsberg plausibly
states, "recruiting fields for groups." For purposes of a sociological
theory of group conflict it is useful to reduce the actual conflict groups
of empirical associations to larger aggregates which form part of their
structure and consist of the incumbents of roles endowed with like ex-
pectations of interest.
Only by doubtful analogy can we speak of
"members" of such aggregates or quasi-groups. Thus
it transcends
the legitimate possibilities of theory construction to postulate common
modes of behavior for these "members."
On the other hand, common modes of behavior are characteristic
of
interest
groups
recruited
from
larger
quasi-groups.
Interest
groups are groups in the strict sense of the sociological term; and they
are the real agents of group conflict. They have a structure, a form of
organization, a program or goal, and a personnel of members.
If
Ginsberg demands for such groups "regular contact or communica-

----- Page 199 (native) -----
Social Structurey Group Interestsy Conßict Groups
1 8 1
tion," however, this applies only in an indirect sense.
Interest groups
are always "secondary groups" j
their members are in contact with
each other only by virtue of their membership or by way of their
elected or appointed representatives. One might emphasize the dif-
ference between interest groups and primary groupings such as family
or friendship by calling them with Maclver "associations" or with
Malinowski "institutions." However, it seems to me that the concept
of interest group
is sufficiently unambiguous if, apart from termino-
logical considerations, we keep the modern political party in mind as
an example of such organizations.
It is perhaps necessary to emphasize that the groupings with which
we are here concerned are by no means satisfactorily described by the
concepts of quasi-group and interest group. This is especially evident
in the case of interest groups. The statement that conflict groups are
interest groups
is meaningful, but incomplete. The category of in-
terest group is a general category j virtually any secondary group can
be regarded as an interest group—a chess club as well as an occupa-
tional association, a football team as well as a political party or a trade
union. The specific difference of the quasi-groups and interest groups
with which we are concerned in this study accrues from their origin in
the authority structure of associations or, to put it differently, from the
formal characteristic of their underlying (latent or manifest) interests
as interests related to the legitimacy of relations of domination and
subjection.
This limitation clearly excludes the chess club, the foot-
ball team, and the occupational association, while it leaves us to con-
sider groupings such as trade unions and political parties. Whenever
we refer in the subsequent analysis to quasi-groups and interest groups
without specifically stating this limitation, this
is merely an abbrevi-
ated way of referring to
conflict groups as they emerge from the
authority structure of associations.
The empirical problem of the genesis of interest groups consti-
tutes the subject matter of the following section of
this chapter.
On a more formal level, however, the problem of the relation be-
tween quasi-groups and interest groups may be raised here.
In what
sense are interest groups, such as political parties, to be regarded as
representative of the quasi-groups that can be inferred behind them?
Can the same quasi-group become a recruiting field for several in-
terest groups.?
In principle, the possibility intimated by the latter
question has to be answered in the affirmative. From the point of
view of
conflict theory, competing trade unions of,
say.
Christian
and Socialist description originate from the same quasi-group. Em-

pirically,
interest groups
are always smaller than
their
recruiting
fields, the quasi-groups. They are subsets of the sets constituted by
quasi-groupsj and the identity of set and subset remains a limiting
case. One might compare the relation of the two with that of the
members and the voters of one political party.
Furthermore, a num-
ber of specific intervening variables may disturb the immediacy of
the relation between given quasi-groups and interest groups.
While
quasi-groups, being in the nature of a theoretical construction, are
unequivocally defined, organized
interest groups may supplement
the
interests accruing from authority structures by a multitude of
other and independent goals and orientations. This is merely another
expression for the fact that interest groups are "real phenomena,"
and
that, like
all such phenomena, they cannot be completely de-
scribed by one attribute.
Thus, the theory of group conflict involves
no statement about the empirical variety of interest groups.
It con-
centrates on one of their aspects: on their function in social conflicts
as units of manifest interests which can be explained in terms of latent
role interests and their aggregation in quasi-groups."
QUASI-GROUPS AND INTEREST GROUPS
(ll): EMPIRICAL CONDITIONS OF CONFLICT GROUP FORMATION
"It is a matter of no small interest," Ginsberg adds to his defi-
nition of quasi-groups, "to determine at what point these looser con-
figurations crystallize into associations" (47, p. 41). The categories
of quasi-group and interest group mark the two foci of the analysis
of conflict group formation, but they do not describe the connecting
lines between them.
It will now be our task to examine the condi-
tions under which a "class
in
itself" becomes a "class for
itself."
Perhaps the negative side of this problem
is of even greater impor-
tance. We shall want to ascertain the conditions under which the
organization of interest groups does not take place despite the pres-
ence of quasi-groups of latent interests
in an imperatively coordi-
nated association. This is evidently a matter of ascertaining possible
intervening variables which we shall comprehend under the collec-
tive term of "structural conditions of organization,"
In dealing with the empirical process of development of classes
^^ To
illustrate
this rather abstract formulation:
for the theory of conflict,
so-
cialist parties are of interest not as instruments of workers' education or as clublike as-
sociations, but merely
as forces
in
social
conflicts. The same party may function
in
many ways other than as an interest group, but only the latter aspect
is in question in
the present analysis.

Marx has touched upon this problem at many points. Among these
there is one which is particularly illuminating for our present context.
At the end of his essay on the
1 8th of Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte,
Marx
is dealing with "the most numerous class of French society,
the small independent peasants" (8, p. 104). Marx states, to begin
with, that these peasants, by virtue of their situation, their conditions
of existence, their way of life, and their (latent) interests, constitute
a "class," namely,
a quasi-group.
One would therefore expect
a
political organization or interest group to grow out of their midst.
However, precisely this did not happen.
In so far as the identity of
the (latent) interests of the peasants "does not produce a community,
national association and political organization, they do not constitute
a class" (p. 105).
In explaining this surprising fact, Marx refers to
conditions of the kind of the intervening variables in question here:
"The small independent peasants constitute an enormous mass, the
members of which live in the same situation but do not enter into
manifold relations with each other.
Their mode of production iso-
lates them from each other instead of bringing them into mutual
intercourse. This isolation is strengthened by the bad state of French
means of communication and by the poverty of the peasants.
.
.
.
Every single peasant family
is almost self-sufficient
.
.
. and thus
gains its material of life more in exchange with nature than in inter-
course with society" (p. 104). The brilliant conclusion Marx draws
from this analysis—namely, that Louis Bonaparte is trying to justify
his claim for power by reference
to
this quasi-group of peasants
whose interests are condemned to latency—will concern us less here
than the problem impressively demonstrated by
it.
Under certain
conditions, quasi-groups may persist as such without interest groups
emerging from them. What are these conditions, and under which
conditions do interest groups come to be formed?
It may be useful to begin by clarifying the logical status of a
generalizing answer to this question. The categories of latent and
manifest interest, quasi-group and interest group, constitute the ele-
ments of a model of conflict group formation.
Under ideal condi-
tions,
i.e., if no variables not contained in this model intervene, the
analytical^* process of conflict group formation can be represented
as follows.
In every imperatively coordinated association, two quasi-
^^ This needs to be emphasized. We are not here concerned with the chronologi-
cal development of conflict groups. Marx commits at this point an error of hypostasis.
By asserting the analytical sequence as a chronological one, he transforms the "theoreti-
cal phenomenon" quasi-group into a "real phenomenon" in an impermissible manner.

----- Page 202 (native) -----

Social Structurey Growp Interests^ Conflict Groups
groups united by common latent interests can be distinguished. Their
orientations of interest are determined by possession of or exclusion
from
authority.
From these quasi-groups,
interest groups are re-
cruited, the articulate programs of which defend or attack the legiti-
macy of existing authority structures.
In any given association, two
such groupings are in conflict.
This model of conflict group forma-
tion
is as such complete and suffices for all purposes of theoretical
analysis.
In principle, little need be added to
it, and what additions
are required are in the nature of refinements. However, for purposes
of empirical
analysis the model may—as the example of Marx's
"i8th of Brumaire" shows—be useful as a guide to relevant prob-
lems, but
it is as such incomplete. As soon as we pass from the level
of model construction to that of the explanation of empirical prob-
lems, the premise of ideal conditions
is no longer given. We en-
counter intervening variables the identification of which
is our con-
cern at this point.
Determination of the structural conditions of organization
re-
quires the formulation of empirical generalizations.
Here, the se-
curity of theoretical postulates and constructions gives way to the
precarious attempt to expose general facts of social life, to classify
them, and to formulate them hypothetically.
It might be argued
that this step transcends the limits of theory and need not therefore
be taken here.
It passes, indeed, beyond the limits of model con-
struction.
Nevertheless,
it has to be taken in order for the model
to be freed of the suspicion of analytical uselessness. The attempt
to classify intervening variables in a generalizing manner
is all the
more important, since without it ad hoc hypotheses and additions have
free reign." For the sake of the empirical applicability of the model
proposed here
it
is necessary
to
indicate
in general the
structural
conditions of the organization of conflict groups.
Completeness
is
intended but of course not by any means guaranteed.
Malinowski endeavored, in his attempt to classify the character-
istics of what he calls "institutions" (and what might equally well
be called "associations" or simply "organized groups"), to render,
as he puts
it, this category "more serviceable
in field-work" (212,
pp. 52 ff.).
Malinowski lists at this point six features which are of
importance also for interest groups of the kind discussed here: such
groups require a charter, a personnel, certain norms, a material in-
^^ In this sense, Marx's explanation in the "18th Brumaire"
is of course also an
ai hoc addition, if a brilliant one.
All subsequent considerations in this chapter are on
the level of supplementing a theoretical model by empirical generalizations.

strumentarium, certain regular
activities, and an "objective" func-
tion. The latter characteristic
is in our case part of the underlying
model.
Otherwise, however, Malinowski's list contains an important
sector of the empirical conditions of organization of interest groups.
I shall call these conditions the technical conditions of organization.
Without a charter, certain norms, a personnel, and certain material
requisites, interest groups cannot be formed, even
if
it
is justified
to assume that quasi-groups exist.
Obvious as these conditions may
appear,
at least two of them—"charter" and "personnel"—are of
considerable significance, as will become apparent if we specify them
a little.
It
is a commonplace that groups cannot exist without members
and, in that sense, without a personnel.
Moreover, since we have
postulated the presence of a personnel in the quasi-groups from which
interest groups emerge, this condition does not at
first sight appear
to be a genuine intervening variable.
It is, indeed, not the total mem-
bership of an interest group which
is in question here, but that sector
of the membership which can be described as the leading group or
cadre. For an organized interest group to emerge from a quasi-group,
there have to be certain persons who make
this organization
their
business, who carry it out practically and take the lead.
Every party
needs its founders. The availability of founders in this sense, how-
ever, is by no means given in our model nor can
it be.
It
is an addi-
tional empirical condition of conflict group formation.
As such
it
is
a necessary, although not
sufficient, condition of organization.
To
stipulate a leading group as a prerequisite of the organization of in-
terest groups must not be misunderstood to mean that conflict groups
are based on the goals and actions of a handful of leaders. The avail-
ability of possible organizers, founders, and leaders
is essentially a
technical prerequisite which must be satisfied for unorganized quasi-
groups to be transformed into organized interest groups.
The or-
ganizers are one of the ferments, not the starting point or cause of
organization. That without them organization is impossible has been
demonstrated convincingly—in so far as
it
is not self-evident—by
Marx at the place in the "i8th Brumaire" quoted above, and above
all in the "Communist Manifesto."
Marx has realized, also, that the creation of a charter
is not an
automatic process.
Malinowski defines the charter of an organiza-
tion as the "system of values for the pursuit of which human beings
organize" (212, p. 52).
In the particular case of conflict groups these
values consist of what we have called "manifest interests."
While

----- Page 204 (native) -----
1 86
Social Structurey Growp Interestsy Conflict Groups
latent interests are nonpsychological orientations implicit in the social
structure of roles and positions, manifest interests are articulate, for-
mulated
(or
at
least formulable)
programs.
They
entail
specific
claims related to given structures of authority. The articulation and
codification of such interests is again a process that presupposes certain
conditions.
Either there must be a person or circle of persons who
take on themselves the task of articulation and codification, or, al-
ternatively, an "ideology," a system of ideas, must be available which
in a given case is capable of serving as a program or charter of groups.
As evidence for the
first,
it seems sufficient to refer to the role of
the
political
ideologist Marx for the organization of the
socialist
movement j
as evidence of the latter alternative,
to the role of a
certain
interpretation
of
Calvinism
for
early
English
capitalists.
Ideologies understood as articulated and codified manifest interests
are again but a technical condition of organization.
Ideologies do not
create conflict groups or cause conflict groups to emerge.
Yet they
are indispensable as obstetricians of conflict groups, and in this sense
as an intervening variable.
Even if we are given not only quasi-groups with common latent
interests, but leaders and ideologies as well—if, in other words, the
technical conditions of organization are present—it
is still not justi-
fied
to make the empirical
inference
that
interest groups will be
formed. A second category of prerequisites which have to be satisfied
for organization to be possible will be described here as the political
conditions of organization. The totalitarian state is probably the most
unambiguous illustration of a social situation in which these condi-
tions are not fulfilled, and in which therefore at least oppositional
interest groups cannot emerge despite the presence of quasi-groups
and latent interests.'" Where a plurality of conflicting parties
is not
permitted and their emergence suppressed by the absence of freedom
of coalition and by police force, conflict groups cannot organize them-
selves even if all other conditions of their organization are present.
The study of the possibilities and actual types of group conflict under
such conditions
is a problem of sociological analysis of the highest
^° Technically similar conditions obtain in many preindustrial societies.
In terms
of the political conditions of organization the restriction of this study to industrial so-
cieties can be well
illustrated.
In
all preindustrial societies group conflict
is seriously
impeded
by
the
absence
of
certain
political
conditions
(the
political
"citizenship
rights").
It would be a matter for separate analysis to investigate forms of group con-
flict in these societies.

importance. There
is a starting point, here, of the analysis not only
of "underground movements" and the development of revolutions,
but more generally of structure and dynamics of totalitarian states.
But this type of problem can be merely intimated here, since we are
for the time being concerned with formulating the general structural
conditions of organization. We can maintain that the political per-
missibility of organization
is one of the additional intervening pre-
requisites of conflict group formation.
Apart from technical and political conditions, some, in the narrow
sense, sodal conditions of organization are of importance for the for-
mation of interest groups. Among these we find the condition of
communication between the "members" of quasi-groups emphasized
by Marx in the case of French peasants.
If an aggregate within an
association can be described as a community of latent interests, is also
provided with the technical and political possibilities of organization,
but
is so scattered topologically or ecologically that a regular con-
nection among the members of the aggregate does not exist and can
be established only with great
difficulty, then the formation of an
organized
interest group
is empirically most
unlikely.
However,
important as this premise of organization is, the generalization seems
tenable that
its significance
is steadily diminishing in industrial so-
cieties with a highly developed system of means of communication.
In advanced industrial societies this condition may be assumed to be
generally given 5 it enters, therefore, into the analysis of conflict group
formation as a constant.
This
is not the case, however, with another
social condition of
organization the implications of which will occupy us a good deal
more.
Empirically, the formation of organized
interest groups
is
possible only if recruitment to quasi-groups follows a structural pat-
tern rather than chance. By this condition, the group described by
Marx as lumpenfroletariat
is excluded from conflict group forma-
tion.^^
Persons who attain positions relevant for conflict analysis not
by the normal process of the allocation of social positions in a social
structure, but by peculiar, structurally random personal circumstances,
appear generally unsuited for the organization of
conflict groups.
Thus the lowest stratum of industrial societies is frequently recruited
in manifold but
structurally irrelevant ways: by delinquency,
ex-
^^ In my study of unskilled industrial workers in England (143)
I have tried to
show in detail how this one condition
is capable of excluding a large group of people
from political activity.

Social Structure, Group Interests^ Confiict Groups
treme lack of talent, personal mishaps, physical or psychological in-
stability, etc.
In this case, the condition of structural recruitment
is
not satisfied, and conflict group formation cannot be expected.
From the
empirical
conditions of the
organization
of
conflict
groups thus briefly sketched, we can, by way of generalization, derive
a number of social constellations which are unfavorable if not pro-
hibitive for conflict group formation and group conflict. Here, again,
I shall confine myself to giving an indication. One constellation re-
sisting conflict group formation, namely, that of the totalitarian state,
is directly given in the formulated conditions. A second important
constellation can be d-efined by combining several of the factors men-
tioned.
If imperatively coordinated associations are either themselves
just emerging or subject to radical change, the probability
is small
that the quasi-groups derived from their authority structure will lead
to coherent forms of organization.
Examples for this may be seen
in the
early
stages of
industrial development, or
in
societies im-
mediately after social revolutions (such as the Soviet Union in the
1920's)."
In both
cases authority structures,
latent
interests, and
quasi-groups are present.
But in both cases
it seems reasonable to
assume that the absence of leaders and ideologies as well as the still
unpatterned and unnormalized recruitment to the relevant positions
stand in the way of conflict group formation.
In this sense,
it seems
feasible to attempt to reformulate Marx's problem of the gradual
formation of classes in the course of industrialization.
The empirical conditions of organization have been described here
as prerequisites of conflict group formation.
However, their effect
goes beyond the process of emergence of conflict groups. These fac-
tors are relevant, also, as variables affecting organized interest groups.
They must then be understood, of course, as continua which permit
gradations. A relative lack of technical, political, and social condi-
tions of organization can hamper organized interest groups in their
operation, and
it can, indeed—which
is apparent in the case of the
political conditions—result
in
their disintegration.
Ideologies may
lose their value as programs and their validity, especially if signifi-
cant structure changes have occurred since their formulation.
Parties
may go through
a "leaderless" period.
Modes of recruitment
to
quasi-groups may change.
Some of the problems of this type we
shall encounter again in the empirical analyses of the final chapters
^^ Here, the absence of the
political conditions of organization
is of course an
added obstacle to interest group formation.

of this study.
First of all, I propose to look a little more closely into
the social and psychological characteristics of the conflict groups stipu-
lated by our model.
A NOTE ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF CONFLICT GROUPS
Conflict groups are certainly also psychological phenomena. We
have defined organized interest groups by manifest interests,
i.e., a
characteristic of clearly psychological reality. Beyond that it
is prob-
able that the formation of interest groups presupposes certain psy-
chological
conditions apart from
its technical,
political, and
social
prerequisites.
For example, identification with the expectations asso-
ciated with authority roles is a condition of conflict group formation
which has been mentioned already.
It seems questionable, however,
whether we comprehend this or any other problem of the psychology
of conflict groups any better by following Warner (75, 100) and
many other predominantly American
social
scientists in
restricting
our questions to an investigation of how people rank themselves or
each other in society. From the point of view of a theory of social
conflict, an approach of this kind
is meaningless because
it seeks to
establish the notion of conflict groups empirically by deriving it from
the opinions of a (more or less)
representative sample of people.
Although investigations concerned with people's self-evaluation and
ranking of others are not entirely without interest for the sociologist,
they are useless for our problem. They substitute for the effort of
a theoretical derivation of significant problems of research the skills
of drawing up
questionnaires and
interpreting interview
findings.
This
is not to say, of course, that there are no social psychological
studies at all which might be helpful for conflict theory. Four inde-
pendent yet
substantially similar studies—those of Centers
(38),
Hoggart (52), Popitz (69), and Willener (76)—are of consider-
able significance here, and will occupy us in some detail as we come
to analyze post-capitalist society in terms of conflict theory.
At this
point, however, we are concerned not with
empirical
findings but
with the type of problem suggested by conflict group formation on
the level of psychological research. A note on this may facilitate our
further considerations.
We can maintain, to begin with, that the model of group forma-
tion formulated
in this chapter does not presuppose or imply any
psychological assumption.
In this model, individual behavior figures
—as indeed
it should in sociological analysis—as a constant. How-
ever, in applying this model to specific empirical conditions, we in-

----- Page 208 (native) -----
190
Social Structurey Growp Interests^ Conflict Groups
evitably encounter factors and variables of a psychological as well as
a sociological nature. The attempt to present a general formulation
of the three most important types of problems which come up here
cannot of course relieve us of testing the validity of such generali-
zations anew in every specific instance.
(i) In exploring the emergence of interest groups from quasi-
groups we encounter a problem which
is logically equivalent to that
of "deviant behavior" in the integration theory of social structure.
Our model postulates quasi-groups and interest groups on the basis of
the position of roles in imperatively coordinated associations.
Thus,
his "class situation" is forced upon the individual with the position
he assumes in an association. On the level of interest groups, conscious
and intentional participation of individuals
is moreover assumed by
definition.
Manifest interests are psychological realities.
Evidently,
their presence can be neither simply assumed nor inferred from the
presence of the technical, political, and social conditions of organi-
zation.
Rather, we have to ask under which psychological conditions
individuals may orient themselves in accordance with or in contra-
diction to the expected interests of their position. The worker who
behaves as if he is not in a position of subjection is like the entrepre-
neur who acts as if he is not in a position of domination, a "deviant"
within the association of industry whose behavior requires a psycho-
logical explanation.
I shall refrain from offering vague suggestions
about possible causes of such behavior j evidently this
is a matter of
social psychological research. ^^
It may be added that if any patterns
of deviance from postulated norms or expectations in this sphere of
social action are discovered, these patterns would by implication con-
stitute the psychological conditions of organization which would thus
supplement the three types of conditions distinguished in the pre-
ceding section.
(2) A second aspect of the psychology of conflict groups would
seem to be of a phenomenological character.
It
is worth exploring
the psychic determinants and features of manifest interests and of
the solidarity of
interest groups based on
these.
The
sociological
aspect of manifest interests is defined by the model of conflict group
formation; moreover, this model permits the discovery of the sub-
stance of manifest interests in given social situations. However,
it
is
a matter of psychological research to examine in given cases whether
^^ The theory of reference group behavior might here be helpful.
It could ac-
count for the weight of conflict groupings in the minds and actions of individuals by
comparison to other types of relation.

specific manifest interests correlate with certain types or character-
istics of personality, and to what extent role interests mold and pene-
trate the personalities of their carriers.^*
For this purpose
it would
be desirable to have an operational definition of manifest interests
which establishes, in general, indices and methods of measuring the
presence as well as the intensity of manifest interests.
(3) The hypothesis seems plausible that weight and intensity of
manifest group interests within the individual personality decrease
as social mobility and the openness of conflict groups increase. The
easier it is for the individual to leave his conflict group, the less likely
is he to engage his whole personality in group conflicts and the more
marginal
is his authority role likely to remain.
But the degree of
openness of conflict groups
is probably not the only determinant of
the intensity of identification with conflict groups.
According to our
theory, an individual can belong to several conflict groups simulta-
neously, in so far as he may play roles in several associations
(e.g.,
industry and political society)
simultaneously.
It appears that the
factual weight of an individual's belongingness to diff^erent associa-
tions within the ensemble of his social personality also influences the
intensity of his solidarity with any one conflict group to which he
belongs.
The problem indicated by these hypotheses
is
at
least
in part
psychological.
It is related to the problem of "class culture" which
frequently appears in sociological literature. "One of the significant
properties ...
of the phenomenon of class consists in the fact that
the members of a class behave towards each other in a way charac-
teristically different from that towards members of other classes, that
they stand in a closer relation to each other, understand each other
better, cooperate more easily, join together and close themselves off
from the outside, look at the same sector of the world with equally
disposed eyes and from like points of view" (Schumpeter,
27,
p.
152).
"Subjectively regarded,
class differences rest upon the de-
velopment of sentiments or groups of emotional dispositions. These
are of three sorts. There
is, first, a feeling of equality in relation to
members of one's own class, a feeling of being at ease with them, a
consciousness that one's mode of behavior will harmonize with the
behavior of the others.
There
is, secondly, a feeling of inferiority
to those above in the social hierarchy, and, thirdly, a feeling of su-
^* This is rather a delicate task, since
it is necessary to avoid the error of correlating
group belongingness and personality type
in
a linear
fashion, or even by way of as-
sumption.

periority to those below" (Ginsberg, 47, pp. 160 f.).
"Social class
is a derivative of the whole social personality of the individual, not
of a mere facet of
it, such as some technical equipment and the in-
terests
it may create.
Social class
is a human aggregation which has
not been submitted to that splitting of individuality into its associative
elements so subtly analyzed by Simmel.
Each member mirrors in
the microcosm of his personality the many featured image of
his
class" (Marshall, 58, p. 100).
These assertions and assumptions
which are representative for a large number of authors—had to be
quoted here in some detail, because they constitute a potential limi-
tation of conflict theory to particular historical situations. They raise
once again the problem of the
feasibility of the concept of
class.
While postponing this aspect for a little while, we must emphasize
here that conflict groups in the sense of this study differ radically
from classes as described by Schumpeter, Ginsberg, and Marshall in
the passages quoted.
Conflict groups
in
the
sense of our model
describe primarily
groupings based on positions in imperatively coordinated associations.
Just as, from the point of view of the individual, his position in an
association constitutes but one potentially very small sector of
his
social personality, his membership in a conflict group refers merely
to a small segment of his personality.
His conflict group claims—to
use an illustration—the entrepreneur as an occupant of a position of
domination in the enterprise, while leaving his behavior as husband,
father, member of a church, a club, even as voter in principle un-
decided.
If there
is a connection between the behavior of an indi-
vidual by virtue of his membership in a conflict group and his total
social behavior, this signifies a special case and cannot be postulated
in general, just as the connection between industry and society is not
determined a priori. The connection or correlation between conflict
behavior and total social behavior is empirically variable and a matter
for specific investigation. We have rejected Marx's and Burnham's
alleged postulate of an identity of the authority structures of industry
and the state, because
it has revealed itself as a speculative dogma.
Analogously, we must also reject the general correlation asserted by
Schumpeter, Marshall, and Ginsberg between conflict group mem-
bership and social personality^ again, this is no more than a generali-
zation derived from a single observation."
If we take this step, we
^^ It may be suspected that all three authors are talking of social strata rather than
conflict groups; and for strata their criteria may indeed hold.
But the effort of the
distinction between the analysis of social stratification and that of conflict must be sus-
tained on all levels.

----- Page 211 (native) -----

193
have reduced the problem of "class culture"
(i.e., of the connection
between membership in conflict groups and general social behavior)
to a problem of empirical psychology. A continuous scale might be
constructed, ranging from complete identity (a correlation of +1)
of conflict behavior and general social behavior to complete
irrele-
vance (a correlation of o) of conflict behavior for other
social be-
havior. At a later stage, the importance of this step for the analysis
of conflict in advanced industrial societies will become apparent. The
authority role of the individual and such patterns of behavior as can
be inferred from
it are an independent variable the connection of
which with other aspects of social behavior
is theoretically indeter-
minate and can be established only by empirical observation. Whether
the whole personality of the individual
is molded by his belonging
to a conflict group, or whether the individual acts as a member of a
conflict group only for limited periods of time (such as during his
working time) and in limited social relations (such as in his capacity
as trade unionist) while being guided by entirely different norms at
other times and in other relations—this
is a problem the solution of
which suggests types of conflict groups and degrees of intensity of
conflicts but has nothing to do with the existence of such groups and
conflicts. At least in part, this solution is evidently a task of psycho-
logical research.
"elites" and "ruling classes"
Our model of conflict group formation stipulates the existence of
two opposed groupings in any given association. Each of these groups
shares certain features, and each
differs from the other by contra-
dictory orientations of interest.
Before concluding the abstract dis-
cussion of the model and the examination of some of
its empirical
consequences we may ask what, if anything, can be stated in general
about the two groups thus distinguished.
Independent of particular
empirical conditions, are there any features that characterize or other-
wise distinguish the occupants of positions of domination and their
interest groups from those of positions of subjection?
It appears
useful to discuss this problem with reference to the theories of three
sociologists whose work
is here representative and has heretofore in
this discussion deliberately been mentioned only occasionally.
I mean
Pareto
(25), Mosca
(24), and Aron
(34), whose conceptions
re-
semble ours in several points. Of the three, Mosca takes the most
explicit stand on the problem at hand, and his conception will there-
fore require particular attention.
The chief element of the model of class formation consists in the

Social Structurey Group Interests, Conflict Groups
explanation of conflicts of interest groups in terms of quasi-groups
determined by the distribution of authority in imperatively coordi-
nated associations. We share this emphasis on authority structures
with
all three authors mentioned, whose work might therefore be
described as the proximate origin of a theory of conflict of the type
here proposed.^®
Since they argue
in terms of
authority, Pareto,
Mosca, and Aron also operate with a two-class model.
It
is charac-
teristic of all of them, however, that they concentrate their attention
—unlike Marx, Weber, and many others—on the group possessing
authority, the members of which occupy, in other words, positions of
domination. We shall presently consider some of the implications
of this emphasis on dominating groups for the analysis of subjected
groups and of group
conflict in general.
In describing dominating
conflict groups the authors in question use primarily two concepts.
Mosca refers almost exclusively to the "political class" which, in the
German and English translations of his Elementi di Scienza Political
has become a "ruling class."
Pareto introduces for this group the
much-disputed category of "elite" j however, he distinguishes "gov-
erning" and "nongoverning" elites (25, p. 222) and devotes as much
attention to the latter as to the former. Aron has narrowed down the
notion of "elite" to the "minority" that "exercises power" (34, p.
567)
; elsewhere, he speaks of "ruling classes."
Without entering
into terminological disputes, I propose to examine the general charac-
teristics ascribed by these three authors to dominating groups and the
validity of their analyses.
In their way of posing the problem, the approaches of Pareto,
Mosca, and Aron entail at many points indications of the sociological
theory of group conflict as we understand
it.
All three authors deal
with the problem of inertia, i.e., the tendency of dominating groups
to maintain and defend their domination. They also deal with the
role of legitimacy in the maintenance or change of authority struc-
tures.
Mosca and Pareto, in particular, emphasize the problem of
social mobility to which we shall have to return. As to the psychology
of
conflict groups,
their works contain many a useful
suggestion.
They
discuss
in some
detail
the formation and
disintegration
of
"aristocracies" as well as other types of social change, basing their
analyses on thorough historical documentation.
If for the discussion
^® To this list other names would obviously have to be added, among them, above
all, Max Weber.
However, Weber has
failed
to connect
his theory of power and
authority with the analysis of conflict.
Contrary to Aron's, Pareto's, and Mosca 's, his
woric is suggestive rather than directly indicative of the approach of the present study.

of this section
I
select only five aspects of the theories of Pareto,
Mosca, and Aron, it is because this selection is guided by the intention
to combine a critical examination of these theories with some discus-
sion of the general characteristics of dominating conflict groups.
(i) Even in his definition of dominating groups, Aron refers to
these as "minorities." Mosca does not hesitate to elaborate this into
the general thesis that the ruling class is "always the less numerous"
group. The notion of an elite appears to evoke almost automatically
the idea of the "chosen few," of a small ruling stratum.
Thus, even
Marx describes the action of the proletariat as the "independent move-
ment of the overwhelming majority in the interest of the overwhelm-
ing majority" (14, pp. 20 f.), and almost as a matter of course Geiger,
in his graphical schema of class structure (46, p. 43), represents the
ruling class by a segment of the whole
(circle) much smaller than
the subjected class. That dominating groups are by comparison with
their subjected counterpart often insignificantly small groupings
is
an assumption which to my knowledge has never been contested in
the literature.
Not all authors state as clearly as Machiavelli how
small, exactly, these groups are: "In any
city, however
it may be
organized politically, no more than 40 or 50 men attain real power"
(see 24, p. 271). Mosca, in particular, supplements his political class
by "another, much more numerous stratum including all those who
are suited for leading positions"
(p. 329)
; but by this extension he
merely obliterates his analysis without abandoning the minority char-
acter of
elites.
In
fact, the assumption that
in any association the
number of those subjected to authority
is larger than the number of
those in possession of authority does seem capable of generalization.
It seems hard to imagine an association in which the "rulers" outweigh
the "ruled" in number.
In every state, the number of cabinet min-
isters is smaller than the number of citizens j in every enterprise there
are fewer executives than employees. However, this seemingly gen-
eral statement requires qualification for industrial societies at an ad-
vanced stage of development. Today, one is hardly surprised to find
that in many modern industrial enterprises almost one-third of all
employees exercise superordinate functions.
Delegation of authority
in industry, in the state, and in other associations makes possible in
industrial
societies dominating groups which
are no
longer
small
minorities but which
in size hardly
fall short of subjected groups.
We have earlier examined some of the problems of delegated au-
thority and we shall return to this point. By way of generalization,
these phenomena justify at least the negative statement that
it seems

----- Page 214 (native) -----
196
Social Structurey Grouf Interestsy Conflict Groups
to be one of the characteristics of industrial societies that those who
are plainly subjected to authority in imperatively coordinated associ-
ations of many types not only do not any longer amount to the "over-
whelming majority" but actually decrease steadily.
Pareto's, Mosca's,
and Aron's thesis of a small ruling minority requires correction.
Le-
gitimate power may be distributed,
if with considerable gradations
of spheres of authority, over a large number of positions.
(2) Pareto and Mosca characterize dominating groups by a num-
ber of peculiar properties which are alleged to be necessary for a group
to attain and successfully defend
its position of power.
Pareto em-
phasizes "energy" and "superiority"
(25,
p. 230), an "instinct of
combination," concentration on the proximate, and similar "proper-
ties" (e.g., pp. 242 f.). Mosca goes even further 5 for him "the ruling
minorities usually consist of individuals who are superior to the mass
of the ruled in material, intellectual, and even moral respects, or they
are at least the descendants of individuals who had such virtues. To
put it differently, the members of the ruling minority generally have
real or apparent properties which are highly esteemed and convey
great influence in their societies" (24,
p.
SS)-
This kind of thesis
illustrates that pre-sociological character of Mosca's analyses, i.e., the
speculative recourse from social structures and roles to individuals and
their "properties," which hardly helps our insight into social relations.
Without the full consistency of the Aristotelian argument, Mosca
approximates the notion that certain people are "by nature" rulers or
ruled, freemen or slaves.
This notion, however, in whatever variant
it may appear, has to be banned radically and finally from the socio-
logical theory of group conflict.
Whether dominating conflict groups are characterized by attri-
butes and patterns of behavior other than common manifest interests
is a question that can be answered only by empirical observation and
in relation to specific social conditions.
This
is
in fact the question
with which we have dealt above in terms of "class culture."
It is cer-
tainly possible that there are societies in which dominating groups are
also distinguished by patterns of behavior crystallized hypothetically
in "properties" 5 but
it
is at least equally possible that the coherence
of such groups is confined to the defense of common interests within
well-defined units of social organization without significantly affect-
ing other spheres of the behavior of the members of ruling groups.
From the point of view of the theory of group conflict, the "prop-
erties" of individual group members are in principle indeterminate
and variable.

(3) Mosca consistently derives from two untenable postulates
the minority character of ruling groups and the existence of a common
culture among them—the conclusion that dominating conflict groups
are always better organized than subjected groups. "The minority is
organized simply because it is the minority" (p. SS)-
Like its prem-
ises,
this conclusion can by no means be assumed;
it
is, rather, an
empirical generalization, and one demonstrably
false.
Within the
association of industry, for example,
it would appear that there are
greater obstacles to the formation of an interest group on behalf of
the incumbents of positions of domination (because of the far-going
internal differentiation of this quasi-group ? ) than is the case for the
subjected workers. At the very least, we can say that we know of no
point of view that would permit the postulate that a transition from
quasi-groups to interest groups is easier for dominating than for sub-
jected groups."
(4) Mosca, and to some extent Pareto, means by the name "ruling
class" only the incumbents of positions of domination in the political
society.
Pareto recognizes
elites
in
all spheres and associations of
society, but "governing elites" are for him politically governing elites.
Mosca limits the field of his analyses by the very concept of "political
class."
It
is only Aron who intimates an extension of this approach
by emphasizing "the distinction between the political power of classes,
founded on the position occupied in the state by their representatives,
and their economic power, determined by their place in the process
of production" (34, p. 572). Yet Aron also presupposes the unity of
a class ruling in all spheres in which authority is exercised.
In so far
as this presupposition implies a restriction of conflict analysis to the
association of the political
state,
it
is unnecessary and, indeed, dis-
advantageous; in so far as
it implies the assertion that the "political
class" is eo ipso the ruling group in all other spheres of society,
it
is
once again an untenable empirical generalization. One of the short-
comings of the theories of Mosca, of Pareto, and, to some extent, of
Aron
is that although these authors derive conflict groups from re-
lations of authority, they fail to relate these to the crucial category
of imperatively coordinated associations.
Ruling groups are, in the first place, no more than ruling groups
^^ To clarify this problem fully one would have to consider all the conditions of
organization.
Thus
it might be
feasible
to make an empirical generalization
to the
effect that
in pre-industrial societies ruling groups were
(above
all because of easier
communication) provided with better conditions than subjected groups.
In industrial
societies, however, this clearly does not hold.

within defined associations.
In theory, there can be as many com-
peting, conflicting, or coexisting dominating conflict groups in a society
as there are associations. Whether and in what way certain associa-
tions—such as industry and society—are connected in given societies
is a subject for empirical analysis.
Without doubt, such analysis
is
of considerable significance for a theory of conflict.
Nevertheless,
it
is analytically necessary and empirically fruitful to retain the possi-
bility of a competition or even conflict between the ruling groups of
different associations.
In this sense, the expression "ruling class"
is,
in the singular, quite misleading.
(5) Of the three authors under discussion, Mosca in particular
has fallen victim to a Marxian overestimation of class analysis.
If
Pareto claims that history is "a cemetery of aristocracies" (25, p. 229),
he leaves
it open whether group conflicts or other forces caused the
death of ruling elites. But Mosca is quite explicit
: "One could explain
the whole history of civilized mankind in terms of the conflict between
the attempt of the rulers to monopolize and bequeath political power
and the attempt of new forces to change the relations of power" (24,
pp. 64 f.). This is hardly more than a reformulation of the Marxian
thesis "the history of all hitherto society is the history of class strug-
gles" (14, p. 6).
Mosca's statement is therefore subject to the same
objections. Ruling groups in the sense of the theory here advanced
do by no means determine the entire "level of culture of a people"
(Mosca, 24, p. 54). As coercion theory emphasizes but one aspect of
social structure, thus the
distinction between ruling and subjected
groups
is but one element of society.
It would be false to identify
the upper stratum of a society unequivocally with
its ruling conflict
group. There is no need for these two to be identical with respect to
their personnel, nor do these categories, even if the personnel of upper
stratum and ruling conflict group are the same, describe the same
aspect of social behavior.
In any case, ruling classes or conflict groups
decide not so much the "level of civilization" of a society as the
dynamics of the associations in which they originated.
It is a significant if confusing trait of the theories of Pareto and
Mosca that both of them are concerned less with the explanation of
social change than with that of stability or, as Pareto explicitly says
at many points, of "equilibrium." By concentrating their attention
primarily on the "elite" or "ruling class," they tend to reduce all

----- Page 217 (native) -----
Social Structurey Growp Interestsy Conflict Growps
199
changes to changes in the composition of the ruling class, i.e., to one
type of social mobility,^^
Pareto's "circulation of elites" and Mosca's
emphasis on the "ability" of a people "to produce in
its womb new-
forces suited for leadership" (24, p. 227) aim at the same phenom-
enon, i.e., the regeneration of a leading stratum which
is assumed to
be universally procured by individual mobility.
By virtue of
this
emphasis the theories of Pareto and Mosca take a strange turn of
which their authors are probably not aware. Although both of them
originally refer to two classes (Pareto, p. 226; Mosca, p. 52), their
approach gradually and barely noticeably reduces itself to a "one-
class model," in which only the ruling group functions
as
a
class
proper.
Pareto characteristically speaks, by way of introducing the
notion of "circulation of elites," of "two groups, the elite and the
rest of the fofulation" (p. 226), and Mosca similarly distinguishes
at one point "the subjected masses" and "the
political
class"
(p.
53).^®
Both notions, however—that of a "rest of the population"
and that of "masses"—are basically residual categories defined by
privation and not considered as independently operative forces.
It
need hardly be mentioned that
this procedure robs any theory of
conflict of
its substance.
At this point we see the crucial difference
between elite theories and conflict theories in the sense of the present
study.
The almost unnoticed
transition from
conflict theory
to
elite
theory in the works of Pareto and Mosca has one aspect of some sig-
nificance for our context.
This becomes apparent if we contrast this
modification with Marx^s approach (which at times almost appears
to commit the opposite mistake and to recognize only the proletariat
as a class)
. The thesis might be advanced that in post-classical history
of Europe the industrial workers of the nineteenth century consti-
tuted, indeed, the first subjected group that managed to establish itself
as such,
i.e., that left the stage of quasi-group and organized itself
as an interest group.
Thus, earlier "suppressed classes" could quite
properly be described as "masses" or "rest of the population," that is,
as quasi-groups such as the French peasants of Marx's "i8th Bru-
maire," who provided—as Mosca (p. 104) argues along lines similar
to Marx's in his study of Louis Bonaparte—merely a basis of legiti-

macy and "support" of competing "groups within the political class."
We need not settle this question here.
But the fact that
it can be
raised provides a further reason why I have chosen to limit this study
—contrary to Pareto and Mosca as well as Marx—to industrial so-
cieties.
Perhaps
it
is feasible to make the general assertion that, in
principle, ruling and suppressed classes have, in industrial societies,
equal chances of organization, because in these societies one obstacle
to the organization of subjected groups characteristic for most earlier
societies is removed: the impossibility of communication.
Although
I suspect that the theory formulated in this study might be extended
in such a way as to apply to pre-industrial societies also, I shall confine
myself to applying
it to societies in which manifest conflicts of or-
ganized interest groups are empirically possible.
Subjected conflict groups must therefore not be visualized as es-
sentially unorganized masses without effective force.
In analogy to
the characteristics of ruling groups we can state {a) that they do not
necessarily comprise the majority of the members of an association,
{b) that their members are not necessarily connected by "properties"
or a "culture" beyond the interests that bind them into groups, and
{c) that their existence is always related to particular associations, so
that one society may display several subjected conflict groups. Beyond
these, one distinguishing feature of subjected groups must be empha-
sized.
The Marxian expression "suppressed classes" might appear
to mean that any such group is characterized by the attributes which
Marx ascribed to, or found present
in, the proletariat of his time.
However, this implication
is by no means intended here.
"Pauper-
ism," "slavery," absolute exclusion from the wealth and liberty of
society
is a possible but unnecessary attribute of the incumbents of
roles of subjection. Here, again, the connection is indeterminate, i.e.,
variable, and its particular pattern can be established only by empirical
observation and for particular associations.
It is not only conceivable
that members of the subjected group of one association belong to the
dominating group of another association,
it
is above all possible that
"suppressed classes" enjoy, despite their exclusion from legitimate
power, an (absolutely) high measure of social rewards without this
fact impeding their organization as interest groups or their partici-
pation
in group
conflicts.
Even a "bourgeoisified
proletariat"
can
function as a subjected conflict group, for conflict groups and group
conflicts are solely based on the one criterion of participation in or
exclusion from the exercise of authority in imperatively coordinated
associations.
Difficult as
it may be for minds schooled in Marx to

----- Page 219 (native) -----

201
separate the category of "suppressed class" from the ideas of poverty
and exploitation, a well-formulated theory of group conflict requires
the radical separation of these spheres.
CLASSES OR CONFLICT GROUPS?
Up to this point I have postponed and at times avoided the ques-
tion whether the concept of class is a useful concept to employ and,
if so, what its precise meaning is in the context of the theory of con-
flict group formation. The reader will not have failed to notice that
I have in fact strenuously avoided the word "class" in the present
chapter wherever possible. Before turning now to an attempt to settle
this rather disturbing question, I want to emphasize one point.
In my
opinion, the problem of the applicability of the concept of class is a
purely terminological problem.
In positive terms, this means that it
is in part a matter of arbitrary decision, and in part a matter of con-
venience.
Logically, there is no reason why we should not call quasi-
groups and interest groups classes or anything else.
Pragmatically,
of course, the usage and history of words has to be considered j
it
is
unwise to provoke misunderstandings by choosing words which carry
associations that are not intended.
In negative terms, the termino-
logical nature of this problem means that
I see no meaning in the
statement that class is a "historical concept" in the sense of being in-
separably tied to a
definite
historical entity such
as the
industrial
proletariat of the nineteenth century.
"Historical concepts" of this
kind are fictions of Hegelianism or, more generally, conceptual real-
ism.
If I shall therefore try to bring together, in the following pages,
the arguments that can be advanced for and against using the concept
of class for conflict groups other than those described by Marx, the
ensuing discussion
is concerned exclusively with problems of prag-
matic convenience, and the conclusion
it reaches remains reversible.
So far in our considerations there have emerged four main reasons
why the concept of class should not be applied to the analysis of con-
flicts in post-capitalist societies. The
first of these
is of a historical
nature. We have seen that the changes which have occurred since
Marx's time have in several ways affected the classes with which he
was concerned.
Bourgeoisie and proletariat are no longer uniform
blocs of identically situated and oriented people
if, indeed, they can
be said to exist at all in post-capitalist society. The progressive insti-
tutionalization of the values of achievement and equality has removed
many barriers which for Marx were associated with the concept of
class.
Without anticipating the results of empirical analysis we can

----- Page 220 (native) -----
202
Social Structurey Growp Interests^ Conflict Groufs
already conclude that conflict groups in modern society are likely to
be rather loose aggregations combined for special purposes and within
particular associations.
In view of factual developments of this kind,
it seems certainly questionable whether it is useful to employ for the
conflict groups of advanced industrial society the concept used for the
Marxian classes of the nineteenth century.
This doubt
is strengthened by a second argument accruing from
our theoretical considerations in the present chapter. We have de-
liberately restricted our model of group formation to elementary and
highly formal features of the phenomenon.
Most of the empirical
characteristics of conflict groups are subject to a wide range of varia-
bility the limits of which may be fixed in terms of a constructed model
but the substance of which needs to be determined by observation and
experience.
Conflict groups may, but need not be, immobile entities j
they may, but need not be, characterized by a "class culture" j they
may, but need not, engage in violent conflicts.
Moreover, we have
endeavored to detach the category of conflict groups and the whole
notion of
social
conflicts from economic determinants both
in the
Marxian sense of relations of production and ownership and in the
Weberian sense of socioeconomic class situations.
Conceptually, the
similarity between Marx's and even Weber's concepts of class and
our concept of conflict group is but slight. There is reasonable doubt
as to whether there is a chance for the concept of class not to be mis-
understood if it is applied to conflict groups in the sense of this study.
Thirdly, in addition to these general conceptual
difficulties, the
question must be raised: what precisely do we mean by class even if
we decide to apply this term to conflict groups?
Are we to follow
Ginsberg and conceive of classes as quasi-groups,
i.e., unorganized
aggregates of the occupants of positions endowed with role interests?
Or are we to follow Marx in calling classes only such groups as have
attained political organization and coherence, and which are interest
groups?
Distinctions such as those between "collectivity" and "class,"
or "class" and "party," or "class in itself" and "class for itself" are
necessary, but they do not exactly help to render the concept of class
unambiguous.
Finally, the history of the concept in sociological literature has
to be considered. One may deplore the fact that the terms "class"
and "stratum" have tended to become interchangeable categories in
sociological studies, but
it remains a fact.
While the existence of a
difference between the study of social conflict and the study of social
stratification is probably plausible to anybody, the concepts of "class"

----- Page 221 (native) -----
Social Structurey Grouf Interests^ Conßict Groufs
203
and "stratum," as they are often used today, fail to express this dif-
ference. Under these conditions, it may not be wise to try to restore
to the concept of class a meaning which for many it lost long ago.
There
are, on the other hand, three arguments that might be
held against these doubts about the applicability of the concept of
class to conflict groups in the sense of our model.
First, the alternative
category of conflict group is so general as to be almost embarrassing.
We have explicitly distinguished from other conflicts those conflicts
arising out of the distribution of authority in associations.
Yet there
is no conceivable reason, other than an inconveniently narrow defi-
nition, why the contestants in conflicts between Protestants and Cath-
olics, Negroes and whites, town and country should not be called
conflict groups.
Short of using a more specific, but extremely clumsy,
expression (such as "conflict groups arising from authority structures
in associations"), the concept of class seems to provide a convenient
tool for emphasizing the limitations of scope of the theory advanced
in this study.
This is, secondly, all the more plausible, since the heuristic pur-
pose originally associated with the concept of class is also the heuristic
purpose of this study. When Marx adapted the word "class" to the
requirements of his theories, he used this word as a term for struc-
turally generated groups that engage in conflicts over existing arrange-
ments of social structure.
It is true that before Marx the term "class"
was used by a number of authors in a rather less specific sense j but
it
is probably fair to say that
it was Marx's category which became
germinal for later students in the field and which therefore represents
its original version. The essential importance of this heuristic purpose
has been emphasized at many points in our considerations.
Since there
is no other concept that expresses this purpose with equal clarity, one
might consider it reasonable to retain the concept of class despite all
qualifications necessitated by the arguments against
it.
One of these arguments has referred to the history of the concept
in sociological literature.
Thirdly, however, there is one not entirely
insignificant branch of sociological thinking which has consistently
used (and uses) the term "class" in the form, if not the substance,
assigned to
it by Marx.
This
is true not only for many Marxist
scholars whose work
is, as we have seen, often pitifully barren and
fruitless, but also for eminent non-Marxist (although possibly Marx-
ian)
sociologists such
as Renner and Geiger, Aron and Gurvitch,
Pareto and Mosca, Marshall and Ginsberg, Lipset and Bendix, and
nany others. We might go even further and assert that the trend

----- Page 222 (native) -----
204
Social Structurey Group InterestSy Conflict Groups
of conceptual development in the work of these scholars anticipates
in many ways the theses advanced in the present study.
Many of
them have tried to refine the concept of class by maintaining its heu-
ristic purpose while altering its substance} quite often, this altering
of substance meant a shift from property to power as a determinant,
or other attempts at generalization.
In using the concept of class for
Marx's bourgeoisie and proletariat as well as for modern and utterly
diflFerent
conflict groups, one could refer not only to the origin of
this concept with Marx, but also to a great and unbroken tradition in
sociological analysis.
It is hard to weigh the "pros and cons" of the preceding argument
entirely rationally j an element of personal preference will probably
enter into any decision. Without trying to argue for this decision at
any length, I will therefore state immediately that in my opinion the
case in favor of retaining the concept of class is still sufficiently strong
to warrant
its application to even the most advanced industrial so-
cieties. This decision does involve, of course, a polemical stand against
all those who "falsify" the term "class" by applying it to what should
properly be called social strata.
It also involves considerable exten-
sions of the concept as it was used by Marx as well as by all Marxists
and Marxians.
But
it emphasizes that in class analysis we are con-
cerned {a) with systematic social conflicts and their structural origin,
and {b) with but one specific type of such conflicts.
In terms of our model, the term "class" signifies conflict groups
that are generated by the differential distribution of authority in im-
peratively coordinated associations.
This definition implies no
as-
sumption as to the looseness or rigidity of their coherence, the pres-
ence or absence of a common culture or ideology (beyond specific
interests) among their members, and the intensity or lack of intensity
of their engagement in social conflicts.
It will be noted that this definition
is inconclusive with respect
to the differentiation of quasi-groups and interest groups.
I would
suggest that it is useful to leave it so. The category of class is a general
term for groupings of the kind described more specifically
in our
model of conflict group formation.
For
all particular purposes of
analysis,
it is necessary to abandon this general category in favor of
the more specific concepts of quasi-group and interest group.
The
attempt to confine the concept of class to either of these
is bound,
indeed, to provoke misunderstandings.
Classes, like conflict groups,
indicate an area and type of sociological analysis rather than
its sub-

----- Page 223 (native) -----

205
stance.
Both terms are more useful
in compounds such
as
"class
analysis," "class structure," or "class conflict" than on their own. This
is but one further illustration of the essential insignificance of a ter-
minological dispute about these matters. For purposes of the present
study, and without any dogmatic insistence on terms,
I propose
to
dissolve the alternative "classes or conflict groups" into the definition
"classes as conflict groups."

Conflict Groups, Group Conflicts, and
Social Change
THE "functions" OF SOCIAL CONFLICT
Classes, understood as conflict groups arising out of the authority
structure
of
imperatively
coordinated
associations,
are
in
conflict.
What are—so we must ask if we want to understand the lawfulness
of this phenomenon—the social consequences, intended or unintended,
of such
conflicts?
The discussion of this question involves, almost
inevitably, certain value judgments.
I think that R. Dubin
is right
in summarizing at least one prominent attitude toward the functions
of social conflict as follows: "From the standpoint of the social order,
conflict
is viewed from two positions:
{a)
it may be destructive of
social stability and therefore 'bad' because stability
is goodj
{b)
it
may be evidence of the breakdown of social control and therefore
symptomatic of an underlying instability in the social order.
Both
positions express a value preference for social stability" (77, p. 183).
I would
also agree with Dubin's own
position:
"Conflict may be
labeled dysfunctional or symptomatic of an improperly integrated
society. The empirical existence of conflict, however, is not challenged
by the stability argument.
.
.
. The fact of the matter is that group
conflict cannot be wished out of existence.
It
is a reality with which
social theorists must deal in constructing their general models of social
behaviour" (p. 184).
But I think that in two respects Dubin might
have been rather less cautious.
First,
I should not hesitate, on the
level of value judgments, to express a strong preference for the con-
cept of societies that recognizes conflict as an essential feature of their
structure and process.
Secondly, and quite apart from value judg-
ments, a strong case can be made for group
conflict having conse-
quences which, if not "functional," are utterly necessary for the social
process.
This case rests on the distinction between the two faces of
society—a distinction which underlies our discussions throughout this
study.
It is perhaps the ultimate proof of the necessity of distinguish-

207
ing these two faces that conflict itself, the crucial category in terms
of the coercion model, has two faces, i.e., that of contributing to the
integration of social "systems" and that of making for change.
Both these consequences have been admirably expressed by L.
Coser.
(Although, to my mind, Coser is rather too preoccupied with
what he himself tends to
call the "positive" or "integrative func-
tions" of conflict.) On the one hand, Coser states in the unmistakable
terminology of the integration theory of society (for which see my
italics):
"Conflict may serve to remove dissociating elements
in a
relationship and to re-establish unity.
Insofar as conflict is the reso-
lution of tension between antagonists
it has stabilizing functions and
becomes an integrating component of the relationship. However, not
all conflicts are positively functional for the relationship.
.
.
. Loose-
ly structured groups, and open societies, by allowing conflicts, institute
safeguards against the type of conflict which would endanger basic
consensus and thereby minimize the danger of divergences touching
core values.
The interdependence of antagonistic groups and the
crisscrossing within such societies of conflicts, which serve to ^sew the
social system, together"* by cancelling each other out, thus prevent dis-
integration along one primary line of cleavage" (81, p. 80). On the
other hand, Coser follows Sorel in postulating "the idea that conflict
.
.
.
prevents the ossification of the social system by exerting pres-
sure for innovation and creativity" and states: "This conception seems
to be more generally applicable than to class struggle alone.
Conflict
within and between groups in a society can prevent accommodations
and habitual relations from progressively impoverishing creativity.
The clash of values and interests, the tension between what
is and
what some groups feel ought to be, the conflict between vested interests
and new strata and groups demanding their share of power, wealth
and status, have been productive of vitality" (80, pp. 197 f.).
Conflict may, indeed, from a Utopian point of view, be conceived
as one of the patterns contributing to the maintenance of the status
quo. To be sure, this holds only for regulated conflicts, some of the
conditions of which we shall try to explore presently.
Coser's analysis
of Simmel (81) has convincingly demonstrated that there is no need
to abandon the integration theory of society simply because the phe-
nomenon of conflict "cannot be wished away" but
is a fact of obser-
vation.
In this sense, conflict joins role allocation, socialization, and
mobility as one of the "tolerable" processes which foster rather than
endanger the stability of social systems.
There seems
little doubt,

----- Page 226 (native) -----
208
Conflict GrowpSy Group Conflictsj and Social Change
however, that from this point of view we can barely begin to under-
stand the phenomenon of group conflicts. Were
it only for its "posi-
tive functions," for which Coser found so many telling synonyms,
class conflict would continue to be rather a nuisance which the sociolo-
gist would prefer to dispense with since
it may, after all, "endanger
basic consensus."
So far as the present study
is concerned, "continu-
ing group conflict" will be regarded as "an important way of giving
direction to social change" (Dubin, 77, p. 194).
Societies are essen-
tially
historical
creatures, and, because they
are, they require the
motive force of conflict—or, conversely, because there is conflict, there
is historical change and development. The dialectics of conflict and
history provide the ultimate reason of our interest in this phenomenon
and at the same time signify the consequences of social conflict with
which we are concerned.
Dubin's observation that conflict
is a stubborn fact of social life
is undoubtedly justified.
Earlier, we have made the assertion explicit
that social conflict
is ubiquitous 5
in
fact, this
is one of the premises
of our analysis.
Possibly, this premise permits even further generali-
zation. There has been in recent years some amount of interdiscipli-
nary research on problems of conflict.
In specific features the results
of these interdisciplinary eflForts remain as yet tentative j but one con-
clusion has been brought out by them with
impressive
clarity:
it
appears that not only in social life, but wherever there
is life, there
is conflict.^ May we perhaps go so far as to say that conflict
is a con-
dition necessary for life to be possible at all?
I would suggest, in any
case, that all that
is creativity, innovation, and development in the
life of the individual, his group, and his society
is due, to no small
extent, to the operation of conflicts between group and group, indi-
vidual and individual, emotion and emotion within one individual.
This fundamental fact alone seems to me to justify the value judg-
ment that conflict is essentially "good" and "desirable."
If I here assume social conflict, and the particular type of group
conflict with which we are concerned in the present study, to be ubiq-

uitous,
I want this statement to be understood more rigidly than
is
usual. At an earlier point I have intimated what I mean by rigidity
in this sense. One or two remarks in addition to these earlier hints
seem in order.
In summarizing earlier research, Mack and Snyder
state with some justice that by most authors "competition
is not re-
garded as conflict or a form of conflict" (77, p. 217). The alleged
difference between the two
is identified differently by different au-
thors.
T. H. Marshall emphasizes common
interests, rather than
divergent interests, as characteristic of states of competition or con-
flict (59, p. 99). For Mack and Snyder, "competition involves striv-
ing for scarce obj ects
.
.
.
according to established rules which strict-
ly limit what the competitors can do to each other in the course of
striving 5
the chief objective
is the scarce object, not the injury or
destruction of an opponent per se" (77,
p. 217).
It seems to me,
however, that it is not accidental if Mack and Snyder state a little later
that "conflict arises from 'position scarcity' and 'resource scarcity,' "
and that therefore "conflict relations always involve attempts to gain
control of scarce resources and positions" (pp. 218 f.).
Despite ter-
minological traditions,
I can see no reason why a conceptual distinc-
tion between competition and conflict should be necessary or, indeed,
desirable.^
Like competition,
conflict involves a striving for scarce
resources. From the point of view of linguistic usage,
it
is perfectly
proper to say that conflicting interest groups compete for power. As
far
as the "established rules" of competition
are concerned, they
emphasize but one type of conflict, namely, regulated conflict.
In the
present study, the notion of conflict
is intended to include relations
such as have been described by many other authors as competitive.
Another distinction almost general in the literature is that between
changes "within" and changes "of" or conflicts "within" and conflicts
"about" the system. Many authors have been at pains to define these
differences.
Coser, e.g., proposes "to talk of a change of system when
all major structural relations, its basic institutions and its prevailing
value system have been drastically altered," but admits that "in con-
crete historical reality, no clear-cut distinctions exist" (80, p. 202).
Marshall distinguishes more specifically "conflict that arises out of
^ At least, no such reason has been put forward.
It might be argued, of course,
that the concept of competition employed in economic theory
is rather different from
that defined by Marshall or Mack and Snyder, and does not carry any conflict connota-
tion.
I am not entirely sure that this argument
is justified, but for purposes of the
present analysis competition in a technical economic sense will be excluded.

the division of labor, conflict, that is to say, over the terms on which
cooperation is to take place, as illustrated by a wage dispute between
employer and employed," from "conflict over the system itself upon
which the allocation of functions and the distribution of benefits are
based" (59, p. 99). Thinking in terms of inclusive epochs like "feu-
dalism" and "capitalism" as well as in terms of the existence of po-
litical parties that propose to change "the whole system" can probably
explain the widespread feeling that a distinction between "changes
within" and "changes of"
is necessary.
But apart from these,
it
is
surely no coincidence that
it was Parsons who emphasized that "it is
necessary to distinguish clearly between the processes within the sys-
tem and processes of change of the system."
This very distinction
betrays traces of the integration approach to social analysis.
If con-
flict and change are assumed to be ubiquitous, there
is no relevant
difference between "changes within" and "changes of," because the
"system" is no longer the frame of reference.
It may be useful to
distinguish more or less intense or violent conflicts and major and
minor changes, but these are gradations to be accounted for in terms
of intervening variables of an empirical nature.
In the present study,
no assumption is implied as to the type of change or conflict effected
by the antagonism of conflict groups. Wage disputes as well as po-
litical
conflicts "over the system
itself" will be regarded as mani-
festations of class conflict,
i.e., of clashes of interest arising out of
and concerned with the distribution of authority in associations.
As with the theory of class formation, the real problems of the
theory of class conflict consist in the identification of the empirical
variables delimiting the range of variability of forms and
types.
Change and conflict are equally universal in society. But in historical
reality we always encounter particular changes and specific conflicts,
and these, even in the more limited sphere of class conflict, present
a varied picture of manifold types and forms. Assuming the ubiquity
of conflict and change, we have to try to discover some of the factors
that influence its concrete shapes.
INTENSITY AND VIOLENCE: THE VARIABILITY
OF CLASS CONFLICT
The substance of the theory of class action, or class conflict, can
be summarized in one statement: conflict groups in the sense of this
study, once they have organized themselves, engage in conflicts that
effect structure changes. The theory of class action presupposes the
complete formation of conflict groups and specifies their interrelations.

----- Page 229 (native) -----

211
However, this tautological statement is evidently not all that can be
said about group conflicts, nor is it all that one would expect a theory
of group conflict to provide. Beyond a basic assumption of this kind,
a theory of class conflict has to identify and systematically interrelate
those variables that can be shown to influence patterns of intergroup
conflict. In the present chapter several such variables will be discussed
in some detail, their selection being guided by the significance they
suggest for the course and outcome of class conflict. Before we embark
upon this discussion, however, there is one preliminary question that
has to be settled. The statement that class conflicts are empirically
variable is sufficiently vague to be almost meaningless. What
is
it
we must ask—about class conflicts that is variable and therefore sub-
ject to the influence of factors to be identified?
In this question, the
categories of intensity and violence are essential.
In some connection
or other, the terms "intensity" and "violence" can be found present
in any discussion of conflict. Here is one example. Mack and Snyder,
in their summary of earlier research, on the one hand derive the
proposition "a high degree of intimacy between the parties, as con-
trasted with a high degree of functional interdependence, will in-
tensify conflict" (77, p. 225), while, on the other hand, they suggest
"the more integrated into the society are the parties to
conflict, the
less likely will conflict be violent" (p. 227). The distinction between
the two concepts
is not perhaps entirely clear from these statements,
and, indeed, many authors use them almost synonymously. Yet there
is an important difference between them, as Simmel knew when he
said:
"It is almost inevitable that an element of commonness injects
itself into
.
.
. enmity once the stage of open violence yields to an-
other relationship, even though this new relation may contain a com-
pletely undiminished sum of animosity between the two parties" (see
81, p. 121). That conflict is variable means that its intensity and vio-
lence are variable j but the two may vary independently and are, there-
fore, distinct aspects of any conflict situation.^
The category of intensity refers to the energy expenditure and
degree of involvement of conflicting parties. A particular conflict may
be said to be of high intensity if the cost of victory or defeat
is high
for the parties concerned. The more importance the individual par-
ticipants of a conflict attach to its issues and substance, the more intense
is this conflict.
For class conflict a continuum might be constructed
ranging, e.g., from a conflict within a chess club which involves but
* All italics in the quotations of this paragraph are mine.

212
Conflict Groups, Group Conflicts, and Social Change
a small segment of the individual personalities concerned to the over-
riding class conflict, in Marx's analyses, in which individuals are en-
gaged with almost their entire personalities.
In operational terms,
the cost aspect
is here crucial.
Members of a group that strives to
upset the authority structure of a chess club stand to lose less in case
of defeat than members of a trade union who endeavor to change the
authority structure of the enterprise (or their own social conditions
by way of this authority structure) .* The cost of defeat, and with it
the intensity of conflict, differs in these cases.
By contrast to its intensity, the violence of conflict relates rather
to its manifestations than to its causes j
it is a matter of the weapons
that are chosen by conflict groups to express their hostilities.
Again,
a continuum can be constructed ranging from peaceful discussions to
militant struggles such as strikes and civil wars. Whether or not class
conflict expresses itself in militant clashes of interest
is in principle
independent of the intensity of involvement of the parties. The scale
of degree of violence, including discussion and debate, contest and
competition, struggle and war, displays its own patterns and regulari-
ties.^
Violent class struggles, or class wars, are but one point on this
scale.
While violence and intensity of conflict vary independently, sev-
eral of the factors shortly to be discussed affect both.
This fact can
be illustrated with reference to one factor which has been mentioned
already and which need not therefore be discussed again at any length.
I have mentioned
in the preceding chapter that the conditions of
organization of interest groups continue to affect group conflict even
after the complete formation of conflict groups.
They are, in this
sense, a factor which, among others, accounts for variations of inten-
sity and violence. With respect to the intensity of class conflict, the
political conditions of organization appear especially relevant.
It may
be suggested that, for the individuals concerned, involvement in con-
* I have as yet not given a systematic exposition of the patterns of change effected
by class conflict; the formulation in the text may therefore give rise to misunderstand-
ings. These will,
I hope, be cleared up in the section on "class conflict and structure
change" later in this chapter.
° In terms of the distinction thus introduced, we are now able to reformulate the
contrast between the conception of
conflict here assumed and
that of several other
authors. The latter tend to confine the term "conflict"
to one point on the scale of
degree of violence, namely, highly violent clashes.
In the present study, however, con-
flict
is conceived as including the whole scale,
i.e., any clash of interest independent
of the violence of its expressions.

flicts decreases as the legitimacy of conflicts and, by implication, their
issues become recognized.
However, in the ensemble of factors af-
fecting intensity of conflict, the specific weight of the conditions of
organization is probably not very great. By contrast, it is considerable
among the variables involved in determining the violence of conflict
manifestations. As soon as conflict groups have been permitted and
been able to organize themselves, the most uncontrollably violent
form of conflict, that of guerrilla warfare, is excluded. Moreover, the
very
fact of organization presupposes some degree of recognition
which in turn makes the most violent forms of conflict unnecessary
and, therefore, unlikely.
This
is not to say, of course, that conflicts
between organized groups cannot be highly intense and violent. The
conditions of organization are but one, and not the most important,
factor among many. Of these I have selected four which seem to me
of particular importance and which will be dealt with separately in
the following sections of this chapter.
PLURALISM VERSUS SUPERIMPOSITION: CONTEXTS
AND TYPES OF CONFLICT
One of the crucial elements of the theory of group conflict con-
sists in the strict relation of conflicts to particular associations. Any
given conflict can be explained only in terms of the association in which
it arose and, conversely, any given association can be analyzed in terms
of the conflicts to which
it gives rise.
In theory, this approach would
suggest that inclusive societies present the picture of a multitude of
competing conflicts and conflict groups. The two-class model applies
not to total societies but only to specific associations within societies
(including, of course, the inclusive association of the state,
i.e., the
whole society in its political aspect).
If, in a given society, there are
fifty associations, we should expect to find a hundred classes, or con-
flict groups in the sense of the present study. Apart from these, there
may be an undetermined number of
conflict groups and
conflicts
arising from antagonisms other than those based on the authority
structure of associations.
In fact, of course, this extreme scattering
of conflicts and conflict groups is rarely the case.
Empirical evidence
shows that different conflicts may be, and often are, superimposed in
given historical
societies, so that the multitude of possible
conflict
fronts is reduced to a few dominant conflicts.
I suggest that this phe-
nomenon has considerable bearing on the degree of intensity and vio-
lence of empirical conflicts.

214
Conflict Groups, Group Conflictsy and Social Change
The pluralism-superimpositlon
scale which might thus be con-
structed has two distinct dimensions. One of these relates to the sepa-
ration or combination of conflicts of the class type in different asso-
ciations. Let us restrict ourselves, for purposes of illustration, to the
three associations of the state, industry, and the church in countries
in which one church dominates the sphere of religious institutions.
It is conceivable that the ruling and the subjected groups of each of
these associations are largely separate aggregations. The dignitaries
of the church may be mere citizens of the state and may have no in-
dustrial property or authority.
Similarly, the citizens of the state may
be church dignitaries or industrial managers. This is the kind of situ-
ation here described as pluralistic.
Within each of the three associa-
tions there are (class)
conflicts, but, as between these, there is dissoci-
ation rather than congruence.
Evidently, complete dissociation and
pluralism are, in the case mentioned, empirically rather unlikely.
It
is more probable that the workers of industry are at the same time
mere members of the church and mere citizens of the state. One might
expect that the dignitaries of the church are in some ways connected
with the rulers of the state and possibly even with the owners or man-
agers of industry.
If this
is the
case,
(class)
conflicts of different
associations appear superimposed j
i.e., the opponents of one associa-
tion meet again—with different
titles, perhaps, but in identical re-
lations—in another
association.
In
this case, the personnel of the
conflict groups of different associations is the same.
Such congruence may also occur with conflict groups of different
types.
Again, a realistic example may serve to illustrate the point.
We might suppose that in a given country there are three dominant
types of social conflict: conflict of the class type, conflict between town
and country, and conflict between Protestants and Catholics.
It
is of
course conceivable that these lines of conflict cut across each other in
a random fashion, so that, e.g., there are as many Protestants among
the ruling groups of the state as there are Catholics and as many towns-
people in either denomination as there are countrypeople. However,
here, too, we might suspect that dissociation and pluralism are em-
pirically rather unlikely to occur. One would not be surprised to find
that most Protestants live in towns and most Catholics in the country,
or that only one of the denominations commands the instruments of
political control.
If this is so, we are again faced with a phenomenon
of superimposition in the sense of the same people meeting in different
contexts but in identical relations of conflict.
With respect to the violence of manifestations of
conflict, the
pluralism-superimposition scale
is not likely to be a factor of great

----- Page 233 (native) -----
Conflict Groups, Group Conflicts, and Social Change
215
significance. While there is a possible (negative) correlation between
the degree of pluralism and the violence of conflicts in a given society,
there is little reason to believe that dissociation of types and contexts
of conflict makes industrial strikes, for example, impossible. Only in
the inclusive association of the state would there seem to be a proba-
bility of pluralism reducing and superimposition increasing the vio-
lence of interest clashes.
At the same time, this scale is of the utmost importance for vari-
ations in the intensity of class conflict. The proposition seems plausi-
ble that there
is a close positive correlation between the degree of
superimposition of conflicts and their intensity. When conflict groups
encounter each other in several associations and in several clashes, the
energies expended in all of them will be combined and one over-
riding conflict of interests will emerge.
The situation with which
Marx dealt
is a case in point.
If incumbents of subjected positions
in industry are also subjected in all other associations j
if they are,
moreover, identical with conflict groups other than those determined
by authority relations, a "division of society into two large hostile
classes" may indeed result—a situation, that is, in which one inclusive
conflict dominates the picture of the total society.
If, on the other
hand, the inevitable pluralism of associations
is accompanied by a
pluralism of fronts of conflict, none of these is likely to develop the
intensity of class conflicts of the Marxian type. There is in this case,
for every member of the subjected class of one association, the promise
of gratification in another association.
Every particular
conflict re-
mains confined to the individual in one of his many roles and absorbs
only that part of the individuaPs personality that went into this role.®
The empirical analysis of pluralism and superimposition of contexts
and types of conflict
is one of the important problems suggested by
the theory of social classes and class conflicts.
PLURALISM VERSUS SUPERIMPOSITION: AUTHORITY AND THE
DISTRIBUTION OF REWARDS AND FACILITIES
In connection with the concept of class situation, we have briefly
(and, for the most part, critically) considered the relation between
class structure and social stratification at several points in the pre-
® This type of analysis seems to me to provide one of the answers to the question
why there
is no socialism in the United States. Throughout her history, the pluralism
of associations and conflicts has made inclusive conflict groups held together by quasi-
religious ideologies unnecessary.
There has been no single group that enjoyed uni-
versal privilege or sufi"ered universal alienation.

ceding chapters.
It is not my intention to repeat here what has been
said before.
Rather, I propose to summarize and extend these earlier
discussions with particular emphasis on the problems of intensity and
violence of class conflicts.
It is evident that in the context of a theory
of group conflict of the type under discussion, "class situation"
is an
unnecessary concept.
It means no more than what we have described
as the authority position of aggregates in associations. The condition
of a quasi-group in terms of the distribution of authority signifies the
"situation" that underlies class conflict. However, the traditional con-
cept of class situation includes a number of elements which, while
irrelevant for the formation of social classes, affect their patterns of
conflict in ways to be defined.
Property, economic status, and social
status are no determinants of class, but they do belong to the factors
influencing the empirical course of clashes of interest between conflict
groups.
As with contexts and types of conflict, the problem of rewards and
facilities can be seen in terms of a contrast between divergence and
parallelism, or pluralism and superimposition.
Thus, property can,
but need not, be associated with the exercise of authority.
It
is con-
ceivable that those who occupy positions of domination in industry
do not own industrial property—and, indeed, that those in positions
of subjection do own such property.
The separation of ownership
and control, and certain systems of the distribution of shares to in-
dustrial workers, are cases in point. While neither of these structural
arrangements eliminates the causes of (industrial) conflict, they have
an impact on its intensity and violence. Once again, a certain paral-
lelism between authority and property ownership may seem more
probable, but
it is not necessary.
The same holds for the economic status of persons in different
authority positions. By economic status I shall here understand status
in terms of strictly occupational rewards such as income, job security,
and general social security as it accrues from occupational position.
It
is both possible and reasonably probable that those in positions of
domination enjoy a somewhat higher economic status, and that these
two attributes of social position are in this sense superimposed.
But
numerous illustrations could also be given for divergences between
the two.
In the early labor unions, and for many shop stewards and
local union secretaries today, authority involves a comparative loss of
income and security.
In the Roman Catholic church, authority is sup-
posed, in theory if not in practice, to be accompanied by low economic
status.
In totalitarian countries, political authority usually conveys

----- Page 235 (native) -----
Conflict Groups, Group ConfliciSy and Social Change
217
high incomes but also a high degree of insecurity which lowers the
economic status of dominant groups.
Such divergences of authority
position and economic status make for a plurality of noncongruent
scales of position in a society, which constitutes one of the
critical
facts of class analysis.
Divergences of position are even more evident
if we
contrast
authority
positions with
people's
social
status
in the sense of the
prestige attached to their position by themselves and by others
in
relevant universes of ranking. The prestige of power is a highly pre-
carious quantity in all societies.
Unless all existing studies are wrong
in their findings, there would in fact seem to be, for persons in the
upper ranges of the status scale, an inverse relation between the au-
thority and the
prestige.
The judge
(United
States), the doctor
(Britain), and the university professor (Germany) enjoy a markedly
higher prestige than the cabinet minister or the large-scale entrepre-
neur.^
Probably, the theory of class conflict with
its assumption of
opposing role interests would account for this phenomenon. On the
other hand, there are and have been associations in which the division
of authority and the scale of prestige followed identical lines.
In the
industrial
enterprise,
this would
still seem
to be the
case
in most
countries (and with the possible exception of
scientifically trained
staff members).
Thus, we also find here an empirically variable re-
lation that is likely to affect the course of class conflict.
All examples chosen in the preceding paragraphs serve to illus-
trate the phenomenon of relative deprivation,
i.e., the situation
in
which those subjected to authority are at the same time relatively
worse placed in terms of socioeconomic status.
However,
in nine-
teenth-century Europe, and in some countries even today, we en-
counter what by contrast may be called an absolute deprivation of
groups of people in socioeconomic terms.
If the social condition of
industrial workers, who are as such excluded from authority,
falls
below a physiological subsistence minimum or "poverty
line," the
effects of such deprivation are likely to be different in kind from those
of relative deprivation.
I would suggest that in this case, and in this
case only, the superimposition of scales of status and the distribution
of authority
is likely to increase the violence of class conflict.
This
is a subtle and complex relation.
So far as we know, oppression and
deprivation may reach a point at which militant conflict motivation
gives way to apathy and lethargy. Short of this point, however, there

is reason to believe that absolute deprivation coupled with exclusion
from authority makes for greater violence in conflict relations.
Relative deprivation, on the other hand, tends to affect the in-
tensity of conflict rather than its violence.
If incumbents of positions
of subjection enjoy the countervailing gratification of a relatively high
socioeconomic status, they are unlikely to invest as much energy In
class conflicts arising out of the authority structure of associations as
they would If they were deprived of both authority and socioeconomic
status.
Dominant groups are correspondingly not so likely to be as
involved in the defense of their authority unless their high
socio-
economic status Is simultaneously Involved.
In terms of the Intensity
of conflict, pluralism would again seem to make for a decrease, and
superimposition or congruence for an increase:^ the lower the corre-
lation is between authority position and other aspects of socioeconomic
status, the less Intense are class conflicts likely to be, and vice versa.
MOBILITY VERSUS IMMOBILITY:
Since Marx, the Idea of a "classless society" has remained an often-
used category In sociological literature. By "Marxist" scholars
it
Is
applied to a number of existing societies as an allegedly valid category
of description.
But among "non-Marxist" social scientists, too, the
concept of classless society is occasionally used for describing empirical
states of society. Thus S. Landshut (53) has tried to demonstrate
the classlessness of present-day Western
industrial
societies.
In a
rather more definite sense, a number of sociologists have employed
the concept of a classless society to describe more limited phenomena,
such as the agricultural cooperatives of
Israel.
J. Ben-David, for
example, speaks on this basis of a "collectlvlst," "classless" stage of
the social development of Israel (125). We have now assembled
the materials for examining the sense and nonsense of the sociological
category of a classless society. This examination will reveal an addi-
tional factor affecting the intensity and violence of class conflict.
On the basis of the assumptions and models introduced in this
^ This proposition must be opposed to the assumption of integration theorists that
the congruence of different scales of social position
is a requisite of stable, integrated
societies
(cf.
Parsons,
in 35). The exact opposite seems true, even from
the point
of view of integration theory.
I cannot help feeling that this
is one of the points at
which integration theorists display—unwillingly, to be sure—almost totalitarian con-
victions.

study, the concept of classless society can mean either of two things.
First,
it may be intended to describe societies in which there are no
structures of authority that give rise to the formation of conflict groups
and group conflicts. A society is classless if it is "powerless,"
i.e., if
there is no authority exercised in it at all, or if such authority
is dis-
tributed equally among all
citizens.
But in this sense the category
of classless society is sociologically meaningless.
It may be possible
to conceive of a society in which all differences of income and frestige
are leveled and which
is therefore "stratumless," but
it
is hardly
possible to imagine a society in which there
is no differentiation of
roles in terms of legitimate 'power. Permanent anarchism
is socially
Utopian. Any society, and, indeed, any social organization, requires
some differentiation into positions of domination and positions of sub-
jection. No matter what the formal nature of the authority mecha-
nism, it is a functional imperative of social organizations.
Since classes
can be explained in terms of the differential distribution of authority,
there is no sociological substance in the assumption of a classless society
devoid of differentiated authority structures.
However, the idea of a classless society may be understood in a
second sense.
It
is possible to conceive of a society whose structure
contains positions equipped with different authority rights but which
does not enable any group of persons to occupy these positions regu-
larly and exclusively. The same might hold in imperatively coordi-
nated associations other than the
state,
e.g.,
in industry.
Associa-
tions may be governed by the
principle of an
alternating
chair-
manship, according to which the incumbency of positions of domi-
nation may or may not be patterned.
The
collective settlements
{kibbutzim) of Israel seem to provide a case in point. At least origi-
nally it was stipulated that every member in turn was to occupy the
positions of leadership for relatively short periods of time.®
In view
of examples of this kind, it seems plausible to argue that where there
is no group which is capable of monopolizing the positions of authority,
it is virtually impossible for coherent conflict groups to emerge, and
the society or association in question is therefore classless. To be sure,
this is a kind of classlessness rather different from that of the Utopian
anarchy i still, it cannot be denied that it makes sense to speak of class-
® The same principle (of "annuity") may also be found in other organizations,
such as in German universities where the administrative and scholastic head {Rektor)
changes every year, and every full professor must (or may) expect to be elected in his
time.

lessness in this case also. We might say that societies and associations
governed by a permanently "alternating chairmanship" are classless
so far as social mobility
is concerned, for
it
is not the structure of
positions but the fluctuation of personnel that in this case prevents
the formation of classes and conflict between them. The example of
classlessness by fluctuation provides a welcome opportunity to try to
settle the intricate problem of the relationship of social mobility to
class conflict.
Here, as elsewhere, the concept of social mobility is too general
to be useful.
Different types of mobility have to be distinguished,
and their relation to class conflict examined separately. For purposes
of this analysis, it seems sufficient to distinguish between intergenera-
tion mobility—i.e., fluctuations that from the individual's point of
view occur at the beginning of his occupational (or even educational)
career—and intrageneration mobility, i.e., fluctuations during the oc-
cupational life of the individual.
Either of these, if present to any
considerable extent, of course characterizes societies in which
class
membership is not an inescapable and inherited fate. We shall pres-
ently have to return to this other extreme of the mobility scale which,
according to our theory, suggests a very high intensity of class conflict.
Intergeneration mobility seems fully compatible with class for-
mation and class conflict.
If a man's position in the authority structure
of an association remains the same throughout his membership in this
association,
it appears likely that he belongs to a quasi-group as well
as to an interest group growing out of this, even if his son or his father
belongs to a diff^erent class.
Schumpeter's comparison of classes with
"a hotel or an autobus" which "are always occupied, but always by
different people," is here pertinent (27, p. 171). Where the person-
nel of classes changes between generations only, there
is a sufficient
degree of
stability
to permit the formation of
conflicting
interest
groups. Janowitz's finding that intergeneration mobility has no detri-
mental consequences for the coherence of secondary groupings may
be regarded as an empirical confirmation of this thesis.
The case of societies
in which there
is a high degree of intra-
generation mobility is rather more difiicult. To begin with, further
distinctions are here required. Not all types of intrageneration mo-
bility
afi^ect class formation and class
conflict.
At least potentially,
classes are large groupings which may display, from the point of view
of social stratification, considerable differentiation within themselves.
Mobility within classes, however,
is entirely irrelevant for our con-
text. Thus, upward and downward movements between skilled, semi-

----- Page 239 (native) -----
Conflict Groups, Group Conflicts, and Social Change
ii\
skilled, and unskilled industrial occupations do not affect the stability
of the conflict group of industrial workers. Moreover, single upward
or downward moves by individuals, even if they involve a change of
class allegiance, do not appear destructive of classes.
It
is only the
institutionalized principle of an alternating chairmanship that may
give rise to a state of quasi-classlessness.
If the individual can change
his class belongingness at will, or
is even forced to do so regularly j
if, e.g., the worker can become an entrepreneur merely if he wants to j
or if every member of the community has to be mayor at least once
then we encounter a type and a degree of intrageneration m.obility
that makes class formation and class conflict impossible.
In this case,
class belongingness becomes an accidental or merely temporary occur-
rence.
Although there
still
is a quasi-group structure of authority
roles, the continuous exchange of their incumbents makes impossible
the organization of interest groups defending or attacking the legiti-
macy of authority structures: there is no class conflict, and there are
no classes in the strict sense.
As a mobile society (of the intrageneration variety), the classless
society is thus a sociological category of realistic significance. How-
ever, one qualification to this conclusion is necessary. There
is some-
thing to be said for an empirical generalization which Mosca calls the
"law of inertia":
"All political forces have the property which
in
physics is called inertia, i.e., a tendency to stay in a given state" (24,
p. 61).
Ben-David has specified this "law" with respect to
Israel.
For him, classlessness in the indicated sense characterizes "revolu-
tionary periods" of social development rather than lasting types of
social order ( 125, p. 303). Usually, these periods last but a few years.
Then, that "articulation of the power structure" and "functional dif-
ferentiation"
sets
in which Ben-David demonstrates for the
social
structure of the professions in Israel (p. 309).
Although the rulers
of totalitarian states like to operate with an "ideology of perpetual
national emergency," as demonstrated impressively by Bendix (138,
p. 443), for which the well-known theory of the "permanent revo-
lution" is an example, it is plausible that the indicated state of quasi-
classlessness is never more than a combination of transitory processes
of radical change (which soon gives way to a minimum of stability)
and of monopolization of power that makes possible the formation
of classes and conflict between them.
Classlessness by (intragenera-
tion) mobility
is, in sociological analysis, a limiting case that always
tends toward
its own abolition and that may therefore be ignored.
There is no reason to assume that a stable society can operate on the

----- Page 240 (native) -----
222
Conflict Groups, Group Conflicis, and Social Change
principle of the continuous patterned exchange of the personnel of
authority positions."
While social mobility, apart from its limiting case of permanent
exchange between the classes within generations, cannot thus be said
to present an obstacle to the formation of classes and the existence of
class conflict, there can be little doubt that
it affects the intensity of
class conflict. From the point of view of mobility two distinct types
of classes may be distinguished.
With respect to dominant conflict
groups, Mosca calls one of these the "aristocratic class" bent on the
"maintenance of authority for the descendants of those who possess
it at a given point of time," and distinguishes it from the "democratic
class" characterized by the "tendency to rejuvenate the ruling class
by upward mobility of persons from the ruled class" (24, p. 322).
G. D. H. Cole confines the term "class" to the first of these types and
refers to the second as "elite" (39).
In analogy to those terms of
Max Weber's frequently used in connection with
social mobility
I
would recommend speaking here of "closed" and "open"
classes.
Where allocation to authority positions is based on ascriptive criteria,
we find closed classes. By contrast, open classes are recruited anew
in every generation. These types are nevertheless but two points on
a scale of numerous gradations.
From caste-like
rigidity to quasi-
classlessness there is a continuum of types of social classes determined
by degrees of inter- and intrageneration
social mobility.
It seems
plausible that this continuum also defines a scale of conflict intensity.
There is an inverse relation between the degree of openness of classes
and the intensity of class conflict. The more upward and downward
mobility there is in a society, the less comprehensive and fundamental
are class conflicts likely to be," As mobility increases, group solidarity
is increasingly replaced by competition between individuals, and the
energies invested by individuals in class conflict decrease.
It is easy to see that the correlations between conflict intensity and
empirical variables suggested in the preceding sections of this chapter
^° There
is possibly some connection between the
size of associations and the
feasibility of the principle of alternating chairmanship:
the larger the association, the
smaller the probability that complete openness of the authority positions will be main-
tained
for longer periods of time.
It may be noted,
here,
that even
in the Soviet
Union purges have become more difficult technically today than they were in
1935.
^^ From
this point of view, the limiting case of quasi-classlessness becomes part
of the intensity scale;
it
is distinguished in this sense not by the absence of classes, but
by an intensity of conflict amounting
to zero.
In view of our assumption
that
class
conflicts are universal, this seems the most plausible formulation of the case.

----- Page 241 (native) -----
Conflict GroupsJ Group Conflictsy and Social Change
223
all involve a psychological factor as well. The intensity of conflicts
is a function of the involvement of individuals.
Earlier I have sug-
gested that this involvement
is likely to be greater if the individual
participates in
specific conflicts with several of his roles than
if he
participates only with one. With respect to mobility, our proposition
might be reformulated in psychological terms also.
If the individual
sees for his son, or even for himself, the chance of rising into the
dominant or falling into the subjected
class, he
is not as likely to
engage his whole personality in class conflicts as he is when class posi-
tion is of a more permanent nature. While in general these psycho-
logical assumptions are probably safe to make, it has to be recognized
that from the individual's point of view nonstructural factors may also
influence his involvement in group conflict. Without doubt there are
psychological constellations that make one individual more "quarrel-
some" than another.
I would suggest that individual variations of
this kind are of but minor significance for the over-all intensity of
class conflict j at the same time, their presence must not be overlooked
in a comprehensive analysis.
THE REGULATION OF CLASS CONFLICT
All the factors discussed so far have been related primarily to
variations in the intensity of class conflict. Their effect on the violence
of conflict manifestations seems but slight. The reverse
is true with
respect to the final, and in many ways most crucial, factor affecting
the empirical patterns of class conflict: conflict regulation.
Probably,
eflFective conflict regulation
is also of some consequence for the in-
tensity of group conflict j but this important process is above all con-
cerned with expressions or manifestations of conflict, and it therefore
determines degrees of violence rather than intensity.
In discussing
the regulation of social conflict
I shall start with a number of seem-
ingly terminological problems. As the patient reader will soon realize,
however, every one of these is tied to substantial problems of patterns
of conflict, so that the distinction between terminological and substan-
tial discussions becomes largely spurious.
There are a number of competing concepts for what we shall call
conflict regulation, some of which have connotations not intended here.
This is especially true with respect to the concept of conflict resolution.
The idea that
conflicts may be resolved could mean, and often
is
thought to imply, that
it
is possible to eliminate given conflicts alto-
gether. As used by some, the notion of conflict resolution addresses
itself to the causes rather than the expressions of social conflict.
This

----- Page 242 (native) -----
224
Conflict Groups, Group Conflicts, and Social Change
notion
is at the very least misleading, and I propose to reject
it on
theoretical grounds.
There
is one, and only one, sense in which one
might say that a conflict has been resolved: the specific issues of a
specific conflict, e.g., the claim of a union for a certain wage increase
on a certain date, may be settled in such a way as not to reappear again.
But
it should by now be abundantly evident that from the point of
view here suggested such
specific settlements do not
in the
least
affect the causes and determinants of even the specific conflict of the
example j if, with changing issues, this conflict persists it has not there-
fore been resolved. The concept of conflict resolution will be rejected
as reflecting a sociologically mistaken ideology according to which
complete elimination of conflict
is possible and desirable."
A second notion that has to be rejected as sociologically meaning-
less is that of the suppression of social conflict.
It is perhaps evident
without discussion that suppression cannot be thought of as an effec-
tive (or indeed desirable) means of regulating social conflicts. How-
ever, I would go one step further and assert that effective suppression
of conflict is in the long run impossible.
This assertion contains the
invariably awkward expression "in the long run." Even in our own
century, history has shown that for totalitarian regimes
it
is possible
to suppress opposition both in industry and in the state for what are,
for the people concerned, very considerable periods of time. By using
the phrase "in the long run," I do not want to be misunderstood as
taking a cynical view of facts of this kind.
It seems to me, however,
that the very history of contemporary totalitarian states has demon-
strated that the "long run" in this case extends to no more than a
decade at the most. To the superficial observer this may seepi a sur-
prising statement J unfortunately, I can here substantiate
it only by
one or two rather gross assertions.
Where an attempt
is made to
suppress conflict altogether, either of two consequences
is likely to
occur within at most a decade.
Either suppression amounts to com-
plete nonrecognition and exclusion of opposition, in which case revo-
lutionary changes of the Hungarian type are virtually bound to occur j
or suppression of opposition
is coupled with a careful and continuous
scrutiny of the embryonic manifest interests of the potential oppo-
sition, and changes are introduced from time to time which incorpo-
^^ I recognize of course that the term "conflict resolution" might be defined dif-
ferently. Thus,
I have no doubt that the editors of the journal Conflict Resolution are
really concerned with conflict regulation. However,
it seems to me necessary to empha-
size
in the strongest possible terms the assumption of the universality of
conflict
regulated or not.

Conflict Groups, Group Conflictsy and Social Change
225
rate some of these interests/^
In the latter case, suppression
is not
complete, and violent conflicts may simmer under the surface for a
long time before they erupt j the ineflFectiveness of the former type
of suppression needs no comment.
We are here concerned not with resolution and suppression but
with the regulation of social conflict. By this we mean such forms of
conflict control as address themselves to the expressions of conflicts
rather than their causes, and as imply the continued existence of an-
tagonisms of interest and interest groups.
Effective conflict regula-
tion in this sense presupposes the presence of at least three factors,
each of which
in
itself influences the violence of
conflict manifes-
tations.
First, for effective conflict regulation to be possible, both parties
to a conflict have to recognize the necessity and reality of the conflict
situation and, in this sense, the fundamental justice of the cause of
the opponent.
In a way, this
is a value premise.
Recognizing the
justice of one*s opponent's cause does not mean of course that the
substance of the opponent's interests has to be recognized as justified
at the
outset.
Rather,
recognition means,
here,
that both
parties
accept their conflict for what
it
is, namely, an inevitable outgrowth
of the authority structure of associations.
Wherever the attempt
is
made to dispute the case of the opponent by calling
it "unrealistic,"
or denying the opponent the right to make a case at all, effective regu-
lation
is not possible.
This is also true, however, where conflicts are
not recognized for what they are, and where too great an emphasis
is put on what are often misleadingly called "common interests,"
It
seems to me that the London Economist was well-advised when
it
"reproached British unions for their ^moderation' which
it declared
in part responsible for the stagnation and low productivity of British
capitalism J
it compared their policies unfavourably with the more
aggressive policies of American unions whose constant pressure for
higher wages has kept the American economy dynamic" (see 80, p.
198). Without doubt, there are "common interests" in any conflict
situation; without community, no conflict, and vice versa. However,
the crucial factor for effectively regulating conflicts
is recognition,
and even emphasis, of systematic divergence and opposition.
The
attempt to obliterate lines of conflict by ready ideologies of harmony
^^ This "subtle totalitarianism," as one might call
it, can be amply illustrated by
the history of the Soviet Union. The most striking example
is perhaps provided by
the history of land collectivization (under Stalin), where the peasants'
interests were
increasingly recognized by the government.

----- Page 244 (native) -----
226
Conflict Groups, Group Conflicts, and Social Change
and unity in effect serves to increase rather than decrease the violence
of conflict manifestations.^*
A second prerequisite of effective conflict regulation is the organi-
zation of interest groups. So long as conflicting forces are diffuse, in-
coherent aggregates, regulation is virtually impossible. Here, Coser's
(or Simmel's) point is quite pertinent, namely, that despite the para-
dox of the situation, conflict groups are often actually intent on fos-
tering each other's unity and organization. "A unified party prefers
a unified opponent" (8i, 132).
Guerrilla warfare is not susceptible
of effective regulation.^"^ Dubin believes that it is feasible to make a
general proposition to the effect that "conflict between groups becomes
institutionalized" (77, p. 287).
Once again, however, the problem
of the time span (covered by Dubin's "becomes")
arises.
Possibly,
the inertia principle applies to this aspect of group conflicts also, so
that "in due course" most conflict groups come to be organized. We
have seen, however, that this organization depends above all on cer-
tain structural conditions which are not universally present. From the
point of view of effective conflict regulation, these conditions of or-
ganization may be said to be one of its prerequisites, since the organi-
zation of conflict groups itself is one of its prerequisites.
Thirdly, in order for effective regulation to be possible, the op-
posing parties in social conflicts have to agree on certain formal rules
of the game that provide the framework of their relations.
Again,
Dubin seems to think that such agreement invariably comes about:
"Continuous conflict between groups leads to standardized modes of
conflict.
.
.
.
Continuous conflict between groups leads to routinized
interactions" (77, p. 190). Here, too, however, Dubin's propositions
seem overly optimistic. By rules of the game we shall understand
such procedural norms as are binding for the contestants without prej-
udicing the outcome of the contest.
Normally, they would include
stipulations as to where and how to meet, how to proceed, how to reach
decisions, what sanctions to apply in case of noncompliance, and when
and how to change the rules themselves.
Kerr has pointed out that
such rules are generally advantageous for conflict regulation as well
as for the interest groups involved:
"These rules normally protect
the survival of both parties, reduce the potential injury to each, intro-
^* One illustration of such ill-conceived attitudes and their consequences will be
given in the discussion of the German codetermination experiment in Chapter VII.
^^ I am sure that this point will be confirmed emphatically by all Colonial Secre-
taries of mid-twentieth century governments.
Very often,
it
is
the
absence of an
organized opponent that makes the regulation of colonial disputes in the contemporary
world so difficult.

----- Page 245 (native) -----

ii']
duce some predictability into their actions, and protect third parties
from undue harm" (84, p. 235). Examples for the establishment of
such rules are numerous in industrial and political as well as interna-
tional conflict.
It is important to note, however, that rules of the game
can serve their function only if and as long as they put both parties on
an equal footing and do not imply any substantive stipulations dis-
abling one or the other conflict group."
Once these prerequisites of conflict regulation are present, vary-
ing forms of regulation itself can come into operation. While a com-
prehensive survey of such forms is neither possible nor necessary here,
it seems useful to examine some of the more frequent types of con-
flict regulation in terms of their eff^ect on the violence of class con-
flict.
In this field, generalization
is of course as difficult as
it
is un-
satisfactory. The conditions of different associations differ greatly,
and analogies between types of conflict regulation in, say, industry and
the state, are bound to do injustice to the specific requirements of either
of these associations. Moreover, there are significant differences even
between societies of similar forms of government; no generalization
is feasible, e.g., about the place of the legal institutions of the United
States, France, and Germany, in the regulation of political and in-
dustrial conflicts. For these and similar reasons, I shall confine myself
In the following discussion of forms of conflict regulation to a few
highly abstract remarks which require both extension and modifica-
tion with respect to specific associations and societies."
^® The rules of the game are, from this point of view, always precarious. What
Is
a formal agreement at one point may turn out to prejudice the case of one of the op-
ponents at a later point.
For this reason, rules for changing the rules are perhaps the
most important element of rules of the game (such as, e.g., constitutions).
^^ To facilitate the following discussion,
it may be useful to present a schematic
picture of forms of conflict regulation. The following—highly tentative—schema rep-
resents an extension of a table given by Moore (157,
p. 446) and includes a
list of
terms suggested by Kerr (84,
p.
236).
It
is evidently derived from
conditions of
conflict regulation in industry, and
its adaptation to other associations presents certain
difficulties. The schema
is based on the role of third parties in conflict regulation.
For
further discussion of the types of regulation see the text.
Role of Third Party in the Regulation of Social Conflict

----- Page 246 (native) -----
228
Conflict Groups, Group Conflicts, and Social Change
The first and foremost form of conflict regulation appears to con-
sist in the operation of certain institutions which provide the frame-
work for discussions of and decisions about conflicting issues.
In gen-
eral these institutions may be described as parliamentary or quasi-
parliamentary bodies in which conflicting interest groups or their rep-
resentatives meet in order to carry on their conflict in a relatively peace-
ful and patterned manner. For such institutions to be effective, they
have to comply with at least four standards: they must be autono-
mous bodies invested with the right to reach decisions without having
recourse to outside agencies of any kind j their place in a given associa-
tion has to be monopolistic in the sense that they are the only institu-
tion of its kind; their role must be obligatory both in that conflicting
interest groups have to refer to these institutions in case of acute con-
flicts, and in that decisions reached in them are binding for both interest
groups and their members; and they have to be democratic, i.e., both
parties have to be heard and be given a chance to state their claims
before decisions are reached.
Further procedural arrangements as to
the modes of discussion and decision are part of the rules of the game.
It seems evident that the very creation of parliamentary or quasi-
parliamentary bodies of this kind involves a considerable reduction in
the violence of group conflicts.
Those who have agreed to carry on
their disagreements by means of discussion do not usually engage in
physical violence.
Moreover, the violence of conflicts would seem to
decrease as the efi^ectiveness of parliamentary institutions increases.
At the same time, the presence of such institutions does not generally
guarantee that violent conflicts will be avoided altogether.^^
In many
cases, in order for the violence of group conflict to be effectively re-
duced, autonomous conciliation has to be supplemented by other forms
of conflict regulation. These other forms differ from conciliation in
that all of them involve the intervention of "third parties,** i.e., out-
side agencies.
The mildest form of outside interference with group
conflicts
would seem to consist in what in industry is usually called mediation.
Here, both parties agree to consult an outsider who
is asked to give
^^ The
feasibility of majority decisions and, underlying
this, the
relative per-
manence of authority structures are relevant here.
In the association of the state where
periodical elections are part of the rules of the game, majority decisions are an accept-
able norm, although they may put one of the parties at a permanent disadvantage during
one
election
period.
In
industry,
majority
decisions
are
not
feasible,
because
the
authority structure of the enterprise
is not subject to changes by elections. The likeli-
hood of breakdowns of autonomous conciliation
is therefore considerably greater.

229
advice but whose advice will have no binding force for the parties. At
first sight, this type of regulation may seem to promise little effect;
yet experience in many spheres of social life has shown that mediation
in fact often is the most successful type of conflict regulation.^"
Kerr's
excellent analysis of mediation suggests that this kind of third party
interference generally has at least five favorable consequences for con-
flict regulation:
reduction of irrationality, removal of nonrationality,
exploration of solutions, assistance in graceful retreat, and raising the
cost of conflict (see 84, pp. 236-39). Examples of this form of con-
flict regulation are frequent in industrial and international
conflicts,
but rather rare in political conflict, although in some cases either cer-
tain legal institutions or the incumbents of highly representative posi-
tions (king, president) may serve as mediators between political par-
ties.
The place of legal institutions in conflict regulation
is more ac-
curately described, however, by what in industry is usually called ar-
bitration. There are two types of arbitration, differing in the kind of
commitment to an arbitrator to which conflicting parties have agreed.
The rules of the game may stipulate either that conflicting parties are
obliged to call in an arbitrator in case of breakdown of conciliation and
mediation but are free to accept or reject the arbitrator's decision, or
that they are free to call in an arbitrator but must accept his decision
once they have done so.
In either case, arbitration
is likely to be an
effective means of reducing the violence of class conflict, although ar-
bitration in general can, as Lockwood has pointed out (86), become
a problematical form of conflict regulation.
There
is, according to
Lockwood, a "political" and a "judicial" conception of arbitration.
The
first suggests that
it
is the task of arbitration to find a workable
compromise between conflicting issues accepted as such;
in terms of
conflict theory, this approach promises success. The second conception,
however, views conflicts from a legalistic point of view, i.e., ascribes to
the arbitrator the task of judging the merits of conflicting issues in
terms of fixed standards of "right" and "wrong." Where this is the
case, the rules of the game are likely to prejudice the case of one or

legal and moral sense, conflict itself
is not recognized and the other
party is likely to feel so frustrated as to resort to violence. From in-

dustry, this dichotomy may be transposed to the political and legal
systems. Thus, a comparative analysis of the legal systems of Anglo-
Saxon and Continental European countries would probably show that
whereas in the former a political conception of legal arbitration pre-
vails, the latter display the judicial conception to an extent which
is
dangerous from the point of view of effective conflict regulation.^"
The three forms of conflict regulation thus indicated, i.e., concilia-
tion, mediation, and arbitration, may operate as successive stages of
conflict regulation or be applied individually in given situations.
If
they are understood as a succession of stages, their logical conclusion
would appear to be that type of arbitration in which both the invitation
of an arbitrator and the acceptance of his decision are compulsory for
the parties involved. However, compulsory settlement of disputes is
not, in the sense of conflict theory, an effective mode of conflict regu-
lation. Even if agreed upon by conflicting parties as a rule of inter-
action, it seriously restricts their chances of defending their respective
cases. There is, in compulsory settlement, at least a danger of one or
the other party being dominated by an outside agency, e.g., govern-
ment.
In other words, compulsory settlement may lead to the sup-
pression of conflict, with all the consequences indicated earlier.^^
There is an immense variety of empirical modes of conflict regu-
lation 5 but I suggest that most of these concrete forms represent some
modification or combination of the general types outlined in this sec-
tion.
Conciliation, mediation, and arbitration, and their normative and
structural prerequisites, are the outstanding mechanisms for reducing
the violence of class conflict. Where these routines of relationship are
established, group conflict loses its sting and becomes an institutional-
ized pattern of social life.
For revolutionary upheavals to be trans-
formed into evolutionary changes, there is, contrary to Marx's belief,
no need for a classless society (that is, for a Utopian fiction)
; by effec-
tive regulation, class conflict may become the element of regularity in
a continuously changing world. Even if the intensity of conflict re-
mains undiminished its manifestations may be channeled in such a way
as to protect the individual from the physical threat of a bellum
omnium contra omnes.
In this sense, conflict regulation seems a more
^^ Short of a comprehensive study, this point could be brought out,
I think, by

is borne out by two prominent experiences in the compulsory

satisfactory solution, both theoretical and political, of the "Hobbesian
problem of order" than the solution offered by Talcott Parsons.^^
GROUP CONFLICT AND STRUCTURE CHANGE
Throughout the abstract considerations of the preceding chapters,
we have assumed that group conflicts of the class type result in struc-
ture changes. We have moreover rejected attempts to distinguish be-
tween allegedly different kinds of change such as "changes within"
and "changes of" the structure of associations. Having now assembled
the elements of a theory of class conflict, it is our task, in conclusion, to
specify how structure changes are brought about by class conflict and
under which specific conditions particular modes of structure change
must be expected.
Again, this involves supplementation of a model
by terminological distinctions and empirical generalizations.
Like the stability of social structure, changes in
class structure
must be investigated on the two levels of analysis which we have called
the normative, or ideological, and the factual, or institutional, levels.
Interests may become values, but, also, realities.
If, for example, one
of the manifest interests of a conflict group consists in equality in the
sense of Marshall's citizenship rights, there are two levels on which
this interest may become realized.
First,
it may become a more or
less general value orientation of the citizens of a society j Tocqueville's
"manly and lawful passion for equality" may spread so "that
[it]
incites men to wish all to be powerful and honored" (232, p. s^)-
Secondly, equality may be incorporated in institutional arrangements,
as by the socialization of medicine, the abolition of school and uni-
versity fees, etc. Both processes are processes of change, and it would
be a uselessly speculative undertaking to try and establish a primacy
of either the normative or the institutional level.
While, therefore,
neither of these levels must be neglected in any analysis of structure
change, it nevertheless seems necessary to use an operational approach
that specifies modes of structure change in terms of but one of these
levels. In the present context, all structure changes will be understood
as changes involving the personnel of positions of domination in im-
peratively coordinated associations.
^^ The problem of conflict regulation constitutes the most important consequence
of conflict theory in terms of social policy.
I have only intimated this aspect of the prob-
lem in the preceding discussion, and
its conclusions should not be regarded
as auto-
matically applicable to the political problem of conflict regulation.
Thus, violent con-
flict may at times actually be desirable in some associations.
Generally speaking, how-
ever,
it would seem to be the task of social policy to try to regulate the inevitable con-
flicts of social life by means other than resolution or suppression.

232
Conßict Groups, Group Conflicts, and Social Change
The immediate effect of class conflicts
is brought to bear on the
incumbents of positions of domination, and changes are introduced by
way of these positions.
This operational specification seems tenable in view of the role and
definition of authority in the theory here proposed.
Insofar as the
distribution of authority in associations can be described as the formal
object of class conflict, changes resulting from class conflict are in their
formal aspect always changes in these authority structures or in their
personnel.
Moreover, authority is, from the point of view of socio-
logical analysis," an instrumental value. In class theory, the possession
of authority does not figure as a value sought for its own sake but as
an opportunity to realize specific interests. This conception of author-
ity is in keeping with our distinction of power and authority by the
central category of legitimacy.
It follows from
it that, e.g., an ex-
change of the personnel of positions of domination has to be viewed
not only as a process of rejuvenation of a basically constant "ruling
class" or "elite," but above all as the instrumental aspect of a process
which substantively represents structure change.
In this sense, ex-
changes of personnel are not
in themselves structure changes, but
merely a condition for (from the point of view of the status quo)
"new" interests becoming values or realities.
Problems of changing
patterns of recruitment to an upper stratum are meaningful only in
the context of integration theory. For coercion theory, changes of the
personnel of authority roles are merely the formal or instrumental
aspect of changes of social structure on both the normative and the in-
stitutional levels.
The operational approach suggested permits the distinction of at
least three modes of structure change, each of which requires some
comment. A first mode of change, in this sense, consists in the total
(or near-total) exchange of the personnel of positions of domination
in an association.
This
is clearly the most sudden type of structure
change.
For purposes of illustration we might use the association of
the state, and assume a specific state to be divided in such a way that
there are three political parties, two of which are in opposition and one
in power. A total exchange of the personnel of positions of domination
would involve, then, the replacement of all cabinet ministers, higher
civil servants, and other incumbents of political ofiice by members of

sion of power are of considerable interest, also, as immediately gratifying values.

233
the opposition parties.
In modern states, such sudden changes are a
comparatively rare occurrence j the last outstanding example was prob-
ably provided by the Bolshevik revolution in Russia. Generally speak-
ing, total exchange of ruling personnel might also be described as revo-
lutionary change.
It is at this point that the sociology of revolution
ties in with the theory of group conflict.
Far more frequently we encounter in history, and especially in
modern history, a second mode of structure change, namely, the par-
tial exchange of the personnel of positions of domination.
Such par-
tial exchange signifies evolutionary rather than revolutionary change.
In terms of our illustration, it would be present if the majority party
chose to form a coalition with, say, the smaller one of the two opposi-
tion parties.
In this case, some representatives of the hitherto sub-
jected class penetrate the ruling class and influence the policies adopted
and decisions made.
Coalitions are of course not the only example of
partial exchange j if elections in democratic countries reverse the ma-
jority relations, they usually result in but partial exchanges of gov-
ernment personnel, so that, e.g., cabinet ministers are exchanged, but
some of the judges, diplomats, and higher civil servants of the pre-
vious majority party remain in office.^*
But probably more important than either of these is a third mode
of structure change by class conflict which does not involve any ex-
change of personnel.
It is possible for structure changes in directions
intended by subjected groups to be inaugurated without any members
of these subjected groups penetrating into dominant positions.
This
seemingly accidental consequence of the process of social conflict occurs
in democratic and totalitarian countries alike. In terms of our example,
it would mean that majority and opposition remain stable and dis-
tinct over long periods of time, but the majority party incorporates
proposals and interests of the opposition in its legislation and policies.
Strange as
it may initially appear that structure change should ever
occur without an exchange of ruling personnel, there are nevertheless
numerous illustrations in the history of states, enterprises, churches,
and other associations. To be sure, this third mode of structure change
marks the slowest type of evolution and requires particular skill on
^* There are considerable diflPerences between different countries in this respect,
ranging from the German case where judges and civil servants cannot be fired, to the
American case where replacement of leading personnel tends to include even not-so-
senior civil servants.

234
Conflict Groups, Group Conflicts, and Social Change
the part of the rulers to avoid such suppression of opposing interests
as thereby to provoke revolts^' j
it can nevertheless enable a dominant
class to maintain the legitimacy of its authority over long periods of
time.
Possibly, these three modes of structure change indicate the end
points and center of a scale that measures the suddenness of change.
Partial exchange of personnel is evidently a broad category that covers
the whole field between total exchange and complete stability. How-
ever, while it may be said that structure change is more sudden in the
extent to which more personnel is exchanged, this does not necessarily
mean that it is also more radical. Suddenness and radicalness of struc-
ture change are two dimensions of this phenomenon which can vary
independently, much as the intensity and violence of class conflicts
can vary independently.
There are examples of relatively sudden
changes that are accompanied by but slight modifications of values and
institutions, and there are examples of extremely radical, although
comparatively slow, evolutions.^® Majority shifts in democratic states
illustrate the former case, while the latter is illustrated by such deep
changes in class structure as we have analyzed earlier in this study.
The relation between the radicalness-suddenness dimension of
structure change and the intensity-violence dimension of class con-
flict is more than merely logical.
It may be argued that the suddenness
of change varies directly with the violence of conflict. The more vio-
lent class conflicts are, the more sudden are the changes wrought by it
likely to be.
In this sense, eff^ective conflict regulation serves to re-
duce the suddenness of change.
Well-regulated conflict
is likely to
lead to very gradual change, often near the third mode distinguished
above.
Conflict regulation may, in
fact, constitute a machinery for
forcing on dominant groups recognition of the interests of subjected
groups, which interests are then incorporated in policy. The example
of a wage claim settled by conciliation is a case in point.
Uncontrolled
conflict, on the other hand, always threatens the incumbents of posi-
^^ The history of the Catholic church provides examples of both:
the skiUful
handling of slow changes of policy without exchange of personnel, and the degenera-
tion of this pattern into suppression and consequent revolt.
^* In fact, the two concepts of revolution so often interchanged in the literature
may be differentiated in terms of the distinction between suddenness and radicalness.
The Industrial Revolution was probably more radical than the French Revolution, yet
it was not nearly as sudden. The term "revolution"
is often used indiscriminately for
both particularly radical and particularly sudden changes.
I should prefer to use
it in
the latter sense only.

235
tions of domination in their very possession of authority}
it aims at a
total exchange of leading personnel, and, in
this sense,
at sudden
change.
At least in theory, there is also a scale of the radicalness of struc-
ture change.
However, an operational formulation of such a scale
oflFers particular difficulties.
In general, the radicalness of structure
changes is evidently a function of what in particular historical situa-
tions represents the status quo.
In eighteenth-century Europe, the
peaceful utilization of nuclear energy would certainly have made for
extremely radical changes, both technical and social.
In twentieth-
century Europe,
the same
process, although
still
involving some
change, has no really radical consequences but simply ties in with con-
tinuing trends of
rationalization, automation,
etc.
Similarly—and
more immediately to the point here—changes resulting from conflicts
within the association of the Catholic church are, in most countries of
today, far less radical than they were at earlier times. Thus, the radi-
calness of structure change is not merely a consequence of the inten-
sity of class conflict. Within certain limits, however, this relation does
obtain. The more strongly people are involved in given conflicts, the
more far-reaching are their demands likely to be, and the more radical
will be the changes resulting from this
conflict, irrespective of the
suddenness of such changes.
Radicalness and suddenness of change,
like intensity and violence of conflict, may coincide, but more often
they diverge} and in any case their divergence presents more interest-
ing problems of social analysis than their coincidence.
Apart from historical conditions, the co-variance of the intensity of
conflict and radicalness of change as well as of the violence of conflict
and suddenness of change is further restricted by the structural requi-
sites of associations.
This will become immediately apparent
if we
contrast industrial and political conflict.
In political associations, ex-
change of leadmg personnel is a realistic possibility, so that the whole
scale of suddenness of change can be applied here.
In industrial as-
sociations, exchange of leading personnel
is, except within
certain
very narrow limits, not possible." There are no elections (and there
cannot be) as a result of which the members of management become
''''These limits will be further explored
in Chapter VII, below.
In a formula:
individual members of the subjected
class can be
taken
into management, and
the
personnel of management can be totally replaced by revolutionary action.
However,
both these phenomena indicate structure changes of a special type, namely, changes that
do not satisfy the interests of a subjected group.

----- Page 254 (native) -----
236
Conflict Groups, Group Conflicts, and Social Change
workers, and representatives of labor become managers.
Structure
changes in industry will therefore almost invariably take the form
of changes of policy unaccompanied by exchanges of personnel. To
some extent, similar conditions obtain in most church organizations.
Before investigating processes of structure change by class conflict in
specific associations, we must therefore ascertain the range of pos-
sible modes of change in these associations."^
In general, however, and without losing sight of additional inter-
vening variables, we can propose that different modes of structure
change co-vary with different modes of class conflict. The more in-
tense class conflict
is, the more radical are the changes likely to be
which it brings about j the more violent class conflict is, the more sud-
den are structure changes resulting from
it likely to be.
Structure
change is the final element of the theory of group conflict under dis-
cussion.
Like all other elements of this theory,
it represents but a
segment of more inclusive phenomena of conflict and change.
Pos-
sibly, the typology of change introduced in the preceding pages
is
applicable also to the consequences of kinds of conflict other than that
between classes. As everywhere in this study, however, I have con-
fined myself here to exploring the causes, forms, and consequences of
conflicts generated by the authority structures of imperatively co-
ordinated associations.
THE THEORY OF SOCIAL CLASSES AND CLASS CONFLICT
It may appear premature, if not overambitious, to have used the
word "theory" in connection with the approach outlined in the last two
chapters.
I have suggested a number of premises, concepts, models,
and empirical generalizations which appear to have a bearing on prob-
lems of social conflict and social change, but these suggestions do not
display a degree of formalization and rigidity that would warrant
calling them a theory.
I may say that this shortcoming was partly de-
liberate, partly unavoidable.
It was deliberate in that attempts at for-
malization in sociology have, in my opinion, remained to the present
day more pretentious than useful, and that I understandably wanted to
avoid seeing the approach suggested in this study exposed to the same
criticism. At the same time, I would admit that formalization in so-
^® The specific conditions of industrial associations are clearly related to the
fact
that whereas
it
is possible to conceive of modes of regulation which exclude civil war
forever, strikes cannot be completely avoided. There
is, so to speak, no outlet for in-
tense
conflicts within the
social structure of industry,
so
that intensity
is sometimes
transformed into violence.

ciology is desirable. From this point of view, I regret not to have been
able to give a more rigid formulation to the approach discussed in the
last two chapters.
If in conclusion of this abstract analysis I shall try
now to summarize the main points of my approach to group conflict,
the seemingly systematic character of this summary should not be mis-
taken as a statement that complies with the methodological standards
of scientific theories.
Rather, I hope that this summary may enable
other students in the field to advance beyond the limits of my own
capabilities of formalization.
1. The approach of this study has to be understood in terms of
two premises—one formal, one substantive—which, although they
are of a meta-theoretical or methodological nature, provide the neces-
sary frame of reference of its elements.
1.1. The heuristic purpose of the approach proposed in the pres-
ent study is the explanation of structure changes in terms of group
conflict.
This purpose is therefore neither purely descriptive nor re-
lated to problems of integration and coherence in or of society.
1.2.
In order to do justice to this heuristic purpose it is necessary
to visualize society in terms of the coercion theory of social structure,
i.e., change and conflict have to be assumed as ubiquitous, all elements
of social structure have to be related to instability and change, and
unity and coherence have to be understood as resulting from coercion
and constraint.
2. Within this frame of reference, the theory of social classes and
class conflict involves a number of concepts to be defined.
2.1.
^^Authority
is the probability that a command with a given
specific content will be obeyed by a given group of persons" (M.
Weber, 33^, p. 152).
2. 1. 1. By domination shall be understood the possession of au-
thority,
i.e., the right to issue authoritative commands.
2.1.2. By subjection shall be understood the exclusion from au-
thority, i.e., the duty to obey authoritative commands.
2.2. "An association shall be called imperatively coordinated as-
sociation insofar as its members are, by virtue of a prevailing order,
subject to authority relations" (M. Weber, 33«, p. 153).
2.3.
Orientations of behavior which are inherent in social posi-
tions without necessarily being conscious to their incumbents (role ex-
pectations), and which oppose two aggregates of positions
in any
imperatively coordinated association, shall be called latent interests.
2.4.
Quasi-group shall mean any collectivity of individuals shar-

----- Page 256 (native) -----
238
Conflict Groups, Group Conflicts, and Social Change
ing positions with identical latent interests without having organized
themselves as such.
2.5. Manifest interests shall mean orientations of behavior which
are articulate and conscious to individuals, and which oppose collec-
tivities of individuals in any imperatively coordinated association.
2.6.
Interest group shall mean any organized collectivity of in-
dividuals sharing manifest interests.
2.7. By social class shall be understood such organized or unor-
ganized collectivities of individuals as share manifest or latent in-
terests arising from and related to the authority structure of impera-
tively coordinated
associations.
It follows from the definitions of
latent and manifest
interests that
social
classes are always
conflict
groups.
2.8. Any antagonistic relationship between organized collectivi-
ties of individuals that can be explained in terms of patterns of social
structure (and is not, therefore, sociologically random) shall be called
group conflict.
2.9.
Class conflict shall mean any group conflict that arises from
and is related to the authority structure of imperatively coordinated
associations.
2.10. Any deviation of the values (normative structure) or in-
stitutions (factual structure)
of a unit of social analysis at a given
point of time {T -\- n) from those of a preceding point of time {T)
shall be called structure change, insofar as it involves the incumbents
of positions of domination.
2.10. 1. By radicalness of structure change shall be understood
the significance of consequences and ramifications of structure change.
2.10.2. By suddenness of structure change shall be understood
the extent to which incumbents of positions of domination are re-
placed.
3. The formation of conflict groups of the class type follows a
pattern that can be described in terms of a model involving the fol-
lowing partly analytical, partly hypothetical steps:
3.1.
In any imperatively coordinated association, two, and only
two, aggregates of positions may be distinguished,
i.e., positions of
domination and positions of subjection.
3.2. Each of these aggregates is characterized by common latent
interests J the collectivities of individuals corresponding to them con-
stitute quasi-groups.
3.3. Latent interests are articulated into manifest interestsj and

----- Page 257 (native) -----
Conflict Groups, Group Conflicts, and Social Change
239
the quasi-groups become the recruiting fields of organized interest
groups of the class type.
3.3.1.
Articulation of manifest interests and organization of in-
terest groups can be prevented by the intervention of empirically
variable conditions of organization.
3.3.2. Among the conditions of organization, technical conditions
(personnel, charter), political conditions (freedom of coalition), and
social conditions (communication, patterned recruitment) can be dis-
tinguished. To these, certain nonstructural psychological conditions
(internalization of role interests) may be added.
4. The course of group conflict of the class type also follows a
pattern that can be described in terms of a model involving both
analytical and hypothetical elements.
4.1. Once the formation of conflict groups of the class type
is
complete, they stand, within given associations, in a relation of group
conflict (class conflict).
4.1.1. The intensity of class conflict varies on a scale (from o
to
I ) according to the operation of certain factors.
4. 1 . 1 . 1
. The intensity of class conflict decreases to the extent that
the conditions of class organization are present.
4. 1. 1.2. The intensity of class conflict decreases to the extent that
class conflicts in different associations are dissociated (and not super-
imposed)
.
4. 1. 1. 3. The intensity of class conflict decreases to the extent that
different group conflicts in the same society are dissociated (and not
superimposed).
4. 1. 1. 4. The intensity of class conflict decreases to the extent that
the
distribution of authority and the
distribution of rewards and
facilities in an association are dissociated (and not superimposed).
4. 1. 1. 5. The intensity of class conflict decreases to the extent that
classes are open (and not closed).
4.1.2. The violence of
class conflict varies on a scale (from o
to
I ) according to the operation of certain factors.
4. 1. 2. 1. The violence of class conflict decreases to the extent that
the conditions of class organization are present.
4.1.2.2. The violence of class conflict decreases if absolute depri-
vation of rewards and facilities on the part of a subjected class gives
way to relative deprivation.
4.1.2.3. The violence of class conflict decreases to the extent that
class conflict is effectively regulated.

Conflict Groups, Group Conflicts, and Social Change
4.2. Group conflict of the class type eflfects structure changes in
the associations in which
it occurs.
4.2.1. The radicalness of structure change co-varies with the in-
tensity of class conflict.
4.2.2. The suddenness of structure change co-varies with the vio-
lence of class conflict.
I must leave
it to the reader to judge whether the preceding list
of abstract statements provides a satisfactory summary of the ap-
proach suggested in the last two chapters of this study.
Obviously,
both the summary and
its more elaborate basis are, as they stand,
tentative and in need of many a refinement.
I would nevertheless
claim that even in this preliminary and tentative form the approach
to group
conflict proposed here provides a useful tool of analysis.
It directs our attention to a specific set of problems and furnishes these
with a coherent explanation.
It
is, in this sense, a searchlight that
illuminates one sector of reality.
In the following chapters I shall
try to substantiate this claim by applying the theory of social class
and class conflict to some of the significant problems of post-capitalist
society.

Classes in Post-Capitalist Society
I: Industrial Conflict
CAPITALIST SOCIETY IN THE LIGHT OF THE THEORY
OF GROUP CONFLICT
Formulation and application of a theory are two different mat-
ters, each of which obeys its own laws and patterns. While the theory
itself can be set out in a highly schematic and "logical" fashion, the
analysis of facts would lose much of its color and interest if forced
into the strait jacket of theoretical exposition.
Although
I shall in-
dicate when the following analysis of conflict in advanced industrial
society is guided by the theory of social class and class conflict, I shall
not attempt to rearrange
facts so as to
fit the order of postulates,
models, and hypotheses resulting from the considerations of the last
two chapters. The order of reality rather than of theory will guide
our analysis in the final chapters of this study, except in this section
of this chapter, which serves a special purpose in the context of the
following analysis.
It is proper to demand that if we dismiss an old theory—as we did
Marx's—and replace
it with a new one, the new theory should be
capable of explaining both the facts accounted for and the facts left
unexplained by the old theory.
Thus, one of the tests of the useful-
ness of our theory of group conflict lies in its applicability to the con-
ditions with which Marx dealt. There is, of course, no intrinsic reason
why
it should be possible to deal more schematically with
this his-
torical material than with
post-capitalist
society.
However,
in the
present context I propose to simplify the task of reconsidering class
conflict under capitalism.
I shall refrain from questioning the facts
described by Marx, and, instead, concentrate on how these facts appear
in the light of the theory of group conflict.
This would appear to be
a doubtful procedure.
All too often the societies that appear in the
work of sociologists are merely historical constructions borrowed from
earlier works or even invented
in order to provide an impressive

242
Classes in Post-Capitalist Society (I)
contrast for contemporary data. Were
it not for the thorough docu-
mentation of Marx's work, and for the deliberate sketchiness of this
initial section, I should do everything to avoid the suspicion of having
an uncritical attitude toward history. As
it
is, I must ask the reader's
indulgence if the next few pages leave much to be desired in terms of
historical accuracy and detail.
The starting point of Marx's analyses consists in what he himself
variously calls the "sphere of production," the "relations of produc-
tion," or "property relations."
Clearly, all these expressions refer to
the industrial enterprise and the social relations obtaining within
it.
For Marx, the enterprise is the nucleus of class war.
In terms of our
approach, the relevant feature here is that the industrial enterprise is
an imperatively coordinated association. Marx, of course, emphasized
the property aspect. This seems reasonable, in retrospect, since at his
time it was legal possession of the means of production that provided
both the foundation of capitalist power and the main issue of industrial
conflict J but this is nevertheless too specific an approach to the problem.
Industrial enterprise, being an imperatively coordinated association,
has in it two quasi-groups which we may designate, following Marx,
as those of capital or the capitalists and of wage labor or the wage
laborers. Both capital and labor were united by certain latent interests
which, being contradictory, placed them on the opposite sides of a
conflict relation.
While the most formal objective of the opposing
interests was, in capitalist society, either the maintenance or the change
of the status quo of authority, the precise substance of the conflict
might, in relation to the specific conditions of this period, be described
as a clash between capital's profit orientation and labor's orientation
toward an improvement of their material status.
The intensity of conflict in capitalist society was increased by the
superimposition of authority and other factors of social status, espe-
cially income.
Domination meant, for the capitalists, a high income,
while subjection involved for labor extreme material hardship. There
was a clear correlation between the distribution of authority and social
stratification.
Despite this initial position, large obstacles were in the way of or-
ganization for both quasi-groups in the early stages of industrializa-
tion. We find here that constellation of factors described above (p.
188) which makes the organization of interest groups virtually im-
possible. Lack of leaders and ideologies (technical conditions), het-
erogeneous modes of recruitment to authority positions (social condi-
tions), and, in the case of labor, the absence of freedom of coalition

----- Page 261 (native) -----
Classes in Post-Cafitalist Society (I)
243
(political conditions)—all these hold industrial conflict for some con-
siderable time in a stage of latency, in which there are only occasional
attempts at organization. As industrial associations stabilize, the con-
ditions of organization gradually emerge, and both capital and labor
form organizations (employers' associations, trade unions) in defense
of what are now articulate manifest interests.
Industrial class conflict
enters a manifest phase of which strikes and lockouts are the most tell-
ing symptoms.
The situation described so far is that of the sphere of industry.
It
is characteristic of conflict in capitalist societies, however, that not only
authority and social status, but also industrial and political conflict are
superimposed one on the other. ^ The dominating groups of industry
were at the same time the dominating groups of the state, either in
person, through members of their families, or by other agents. Con-
versely, the subjected groups of industry were as such excluded from
political authority.
Industry is the dominating order of society j
its
structures of authority and patterns of conflict therefore extend to the
whole society. Consequently, the quasi-groups of industry also extend
to the political sphere. The industrial quasi-group of capital becomes,
as bourgeoisie (to use the Marxian terms once again), the dominant
group of the state, whereas wage labor
is, as proletariat, subjected in
the political sphere as well.
Since, under the particular conditions of
capitalist society, conflict fronts that characterized industry and society
were identical, the conflict was intensified to an extraordinary degree.
In the political field, too, organization of conflict groups proved
difficult in the beginning.
Insofar as industrial and political quasi-
groups were identical, the same factors were at work in the state that
tended
to prevent industrial organization.
Moreover,
political
re-
strictions, such as electoral systems, made it difficult for the proletariat
to form effective interest groups. Thus, class conflict was smoldering
below the surface of society for some time, until all restrictions fell
and the two classes met openly in the political arena.
By virtue of the superimposition of various lines of differentiation
this conflict was, as we have seen, extremely intense.
Its intensity was
further increased by the fact that both classes were relatively closed
units.
Mobility within and between generations remained an excep-
^ This
is one of the points where detailed historical analysis would probablv come
to correct the factual statements of Marx.
While in English society in the nineteenth
century
industrial power may,
indeed, almost automatically have conveyed
political
power, this
is not true, e.g., for Germany, where, on the contrary, entrepreneurs were
restricted

elites.

tion.^
Bourgeoisie and proletariat were strictly separate and largely
self-recruiting groups.
But in this period
it was not merely the in-
tensity of the conflict but the violence as well that was extraordinarily
great.
In industry and the
state, there were virtually no accepted
modes of conflict regulation.
In the absence of a democratic process
that put both parties to a conflict on an equal footing, the subjected
class increasingly became a suppressed class which faced as a solid but
powerless bloc the absolute rule of the incumbents of roles of domina-
tion.
Because of this hardening of the class fronts, there were wide-
spread demands for a complete and revolutionary change of existing
structures. For structure changes could not slowly grow out of class
conflict in this stage. Immobility and lack of regulation made the pen-
etration of the ruling class by members of the subjected class impos-
sible. At the same time, there were neither institutional channels nor
ideological provisions for the ruling class to accept and realize any of
the interests of the proletariat.
Thus,
it seemed justified to predict
that
class
conflict
in
capitalist
society tended toward both sudden
and radical changes,
i.e., a revolution promoted by the proletariat
which replaces in one stroke the dominant groups of industry and
society.
Marx carried his analysis of capitalist society approximately to this
point.
Although he went considerably further in detail,
his whole
work converges on the prediction of the proletarian revolution. We
have seen earlier how at this point Marx became a prisoner of pre-
conceived philosophical and, perhaps, political convictions. Thus he
did not, or would not, notice that factual developments followed the
course of his predictions only up to a point. The ossification of conflict
fronts and the intensification of conflict began to be checked both by
the very fact of organization of interest groups on the part of the
proletariat and by the structure changes to which this organization led.
Within industry in particular, signs of the development of modes of
regulation became apparent 5 trade unions managed to make some of
their claims effectively heard and accepted. Marx showed himself a
consistent philosopher but a poor sociologist when he tried to ridicule
such "partial results" and the operation of trade unions
(i.e., indus-
trial conflict, as distinct from political class conflict)
in general.
His
^ Here, again, the correctness of Marx's factual assertions
is doubtful.
It
is hard
to see how a new ruling class—capital—can be recruited without mobility, including
mobility between the classes.
It
is obvious here that, even in the sense of our theory,
Marx has geared his facts in such a way as to make plausible the extreme civil-war type
of conflict which he anticipated.

attempt to advocate, despite such tendencies, an intensification of the
class war, and his insistence on the revolutionary goal of the prole-
tariat, document his prophetic and political rather than his scientific
self. At this point, we have to reject not only the substance, but the
very intention of his work.
Before we try to follow the indicated lines of class conflict some-
what beyond the point of Marx's
analysis, one
clarifying remark
seems in place.
It should now be abundantly clear that the traditional,
Marxian concept of class is but a special case of the concept advanced
in the present study. For Marx, classes are conflict groups under con-
ditions of {a) absence of mobility, {b) superimposition of authority,
property, and general social status, {c) superimposition of industrial
and political conflict, and {d) absence of effective conflict regulation.
Thus, classes are conflict groups involved in extremely intense and
violent conflicts directed toward equally extremely sudden and radi-
cal changes. This is the "traditional" or "historical" concept of class.
As against this concept, we have removed all four conditions men-
tioned from
its definition and included them as empirically variable
factors in a theory of social class and class conflict.
In this way, the
concept itself becomes a highly formal and—in this sense—"unhis-
torical" category j but the theory gains in fruitfulness, range, and ap-
plicability.
Thus, what has happened since Marx are in fact changes in the
factors that contributed to the intensity and violence of the conflicts of
his time.
Patterns of conflict regulation emerged in both industry and
the state. More and more, the democratic process of decision-making
gave both parties a chance to realize their goals. The violence of class
conflict was thereby effectively reduced. The institutionalization of
social mobility made for a certain degree of openness in both classes.
Absolute deprivation on the scales of social stratification gave way, for
the proletariat, to relative deprivation, and later, for some, to com-
parative gratification.
Finally, the associations of industry and the
state were dissociated to some extent.
All these changes served to
reduce both the intensity and the violence of class conflict
in post-
capitalist society, and to make sudden and radical structure changes in-
creasingly improbable. New patterns of class conflict emerge, to which
we shall turn presently.
It must, of course, be emphasized that, whatever concept or theory
one employs, history cannot be explained solely in terms of
class.
The changes that separate capitalist and post-capitalist society are not
wholly due to the effects of class conflict, nor have they merely been

----- Page 264 (native) -----
246
Classes in Post-Ca-pkalisi Society (I)
changes in the patterns of conflict. Thus, the subdivision of authority
positions stimulated by an ideology of rationalization in both the en-
terprise and the state is an autonomous process. The decomposition of
capital and labor by the separation of ownership and control, and by
the emergence of new differentiations of skill, has consequences for
class conflict but is due to other factors. As a comprehensive process,
the development from capitalist to post-capitalist society remains out-
side the scope of the present analysis. But it should be clear from the
preceding sketch that in principle our theory of group conflict is appli-
cable, also, to the facts with which Marx dealt—and I hope it will be
clear from the following rather more elaborate analysis in what sense
it
lends
itself, by generalizing
earlier
approaches,
to
a coherent
account of industrial and political conflict in the contemporary world.
DO WE STILL HAVE A CLASS SOCIETY?
In a sense, Schelsky
is undoubtedly right in calling the "often
heard question
.
.
.: Have we
still got
a
class
society today?"
a
"naive" question (72, p. 62). However, this question is naive not so
much because
it
is too general to be answered with a plain "yes" or
"no," but because it can be answered without thereby stating anything
significant or exciting about
post-capitalist
society.
Are there
still
classes?
Or, as we can ask more precisely now: Are there still interest
groups and quasi-groups in the sense of class theory?
That there are
interest groups in contemporary society can be affirmed immediately.
There are, for example, trade unions and employers' associations, pro-
gressive and conservative political parties.
It
is not difficult to show
that
all these organizations are interest groups in the sense of our
definition.
Quasi-groups, on the other hand, may be assumed to exist
wherever there are authority relations and imperatively coordinated
associations.
Is it necessary to prove that there are such associations and
relations in contemporary society? The state, the industrial enterprise,
the churches—to mention only a few—are imperatively coordinated
associations which exist in all modern societies and which, if our theory
is right, justify the assumption that there are quasi-groups with con-
flicting latent interests within them. And if post-capitalist society has
quasi-groups and interest groups, it has classes also. Like its precursor,
advanced industrial society
is a class society.
Concept and theory of
class are still applicable.
By taking this position we differ from a number of sociologists
whose work has been discussed above.
But
is this difference, as de-
scribed so
far, more than a difference of terminology?
Cannot the

----- Page 265 (native) -----
classes in Post-Cafitalist Society (I)
247
charge be leveled against us that we presuppose the existence of classes
by definition instead of demonstrating it empirically?
Can we really
answer the question of whether we still have a class society as easily
as we did?
The assertion that there still are classes because there are quasi-
groups and interest groups is indeed less than a definition.
It is, on the
basis of class theory, a mere tautology. On the other hand, the asser-
tion that there are still classes because there are imperatively coordi-
nated associations is more than a definition. Although
it presupposes
the theoretical—and perhaps definitional—connection between classes
and authority relations,
it asserts the empirical presence of relations
of authority.
Social
classes and class
conflict are present wherever
authority is distributed unequally over social positions.
It may seem
trivial to state that such unequal distribution exists in associations of
post-capitalist society, but this assertion nevertheless establishes both
the applicability of class theory and the radical difference from all at-
tempts to describe contemporary society as classless.
Nevertheless, to conclude merely that we are still living in a class
society is as insufficient as it is unsatisfactory.
It marks the beginning,
not the end, of an analysis of advanced industrial society. For rhany
people, the notion of a class society immediately evokes such definite
associations that to apply it to a particular society might appear to in-
volve a substantial statement of fact.
I should like to emphasize there-
fore that I do not regard
it as such.
I am concerned, here, not with
asserting the applicability of class theory, but with applying it.
If im-
peratively coordinated associations can be shown to be a functional
requisite of social structures, then the universal existence of classes
is
postulated by the same token. By way of empirical generalization we
can maintain at the very least that in many societies there are associa-
tions and classes, and in all known societies social conflicts.
Societies do
not differ by the fact that in some there are classes and in others not.
Just as in the sociology of the family we are concerned not with the
existence but with the patterns and functions of the family, so here we
are dealing not with the presence of classes but with their nature and
effect. By confronting capitalist with post-capitalist society we want to
discover the changed patterns and conditions of class formation and
class conflict.
Historically, the problem of an analysis of post-capitalist
society in terms of class may be formulated as one of the destiny of the
"old" conflict between capital and labor, bourgeoisie and proletariat.
If we project the historical problem into the present it becomes trans-
formed into the task to apply the tool of class theory to some critical

----- Page 266 (native) -----
248
Classes in Post-Cafitalist Society (I)
features of post-capitalist society and to try to contribute in this way
to the understanding of the society in which we live.
The "society in which we live" covers a multitude of generalities.
It is as awkward as it can be fruitful to lump together, in sociological
analysis, a number of societies under a general term, such as "advanced
industrial" or "post-capitalist society."
Most of the data presented
so far in this study relate to contemporary British, American, and Ger-
man society.
It
is an open question whether these data, or the con-
clusions derived from them, apply to French, Italian, Japanese, or
Russian society as well—and indeed, whether there are not significant
differences between Germany, Britain, and the United States which
would have to be taken into account.
I am well aware of this problem,
and of the criticism to which
I lay myself open in not discussing
it
more elaborately.
It
is nevertheless my intention to try to consider
some of the features of the industrial and political life of "post-cap-
italist society" without referring to
specific countries or periods in
more definite terms than by stating my belief that the conclusions of
our analysis apply at least to those democratic countries of the West
that underwent industrialization
in the nineteenth century, and
at
most to all societies at an advanced stage of industrial development.
In this analysis, I shall avoid generalities by specifying subject rather
than time and place. By concentrating on a few salient points, I hope
to pave the way for more detailed investigations. This essay—for such
it is—does not pretend to answer all problems of conflict in post-capi-
talist society.
THE AUTHORITY STRUCTURE OF THE INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISE
One social institution to which Marx devoted a great deal of at-
tention has survived capitalist society:
the industrial enterprise.
Tri-
vial as this statement may sound, there is no reason to avoid
it. There
can be no doubt that many changes have occurred in the century be-
tween
1 850 and 1950 both outside and inside the industrial enterprise.
It may appear meaningless to identify the small factory of a capitalist
entrepreneur in 1850 with the large corporation of 19 50 in terms of
productive capacity and number of employees, technical perfection
and spatial extension, complexity of organization and conditions of
work. However, although these changes are by no means irrelevant
for conflict analysis, we have to start with a more fundamental rela-
tion which remains, or has remained so far, unchanged.
In capitalist
as in post-capitalist society, in the Soviet Union as in the United States,

classes in Post-Cafkalist Society (I)
249
the industrial enterprise
is an imperatively coordinated association.^
Everywhere it displays those conditions of social structure which give
rise to social
conflict in terms of class theory.
Wherever there are
industrial enterprises, there are authority relations, latent interests,
quasi-groups, and (Industrial)
classes.
In dealing with the formal organization of the enterprise a dis-
tinction is usually made between the "functional" aspect of the division
of labor and the "scalar" aspect of super- and subordination. Both are
functionally necessary 5 they are complementary aspects of industrial
organization. One of the secrets of the increase of productivity by
mechanized factory production
lies in the subdivision of the
total
process of production into cooperative detail processes. Every one of
these
is equally indispensable for the accomplishment of the
total
process. From a strict functional point of view, the unskilled laborer,
the foreman, and the executive stand on one level ; the enterprise can-
not function if one of these positions remains vacant. However, for
purposes of the organization, coordination, and leadership of such
subdivided detail processes a principle other than the division of labor
is needed. A system of super-and subordination guarantees the fric-
tionless operation of the total process of production—a system,
in
other words, which establishes authority relations between the various
positions. The incumbents of certain positions are endowed with the
right to make decisions as to who does what, when, and how 5 the in-
cumbents of other positions have to submit to these decisions.
Nor
are the commands given and obeyed in the industrial enterprise con-
fined to technical work tasks
: hiring and firing, the fixing of wage rates
and piecework systems, introduction and control of disciplinary regu-
lations, and other modes of behavior are part of the role expectations
of the incumbents of authority positions in the enterprise and give
rise, therefore, to its scalar or authority structure. For the industrial
worker, the labor contract implies acceptance of a role which
is, inter
alia, defined by the obligation to comply with the commands of given
persons.
Industrial authority does not, of course, involve the subordi-
nation of total persons under other persons j
it is restricted to persons
^ I deliberately neglect in the following analysis the often overstressed tendencies
of automation and their social implications.
It
is of course conceivable
that automa-
tion will change not only the conditions of work, but also the authority structure of the
enterprise, but this
is today without doubt a distant dream which need not and must
not be taken
into account, unless we want sociological analysis
to evaporate
into the
skies of fantasy or science fiction.

----- Page 268 (native) -----
250
classes in Post-Capitalisf Society (I)
as incumbents of given, limited roles j but it is therefore no less author-
ity,
i.e., a "probability that a command with a given specific content
will be obeyed by a given group of persons."
Although,
in other
words, the foreman cannot legitimately command his workers to col-
lect stamps in their leisure time, there exist in the industrial enterprise,
within a definable range, authority relations in the strict sense of class
theory.
Some industrial sociologists have denied the applicability of the
category of authority to industrial enterprises either in general or in
specific instances.
Thus, Neuloh confronts "unilateral industrial or-
ganization" characterized by authority relations with the (sociologi-
cally contradictory) notion of "bilateral organization," where "super-
ordinates and subordinates or their representatives participate with
equal rights in the process of decision-making" (160, p. 54), so that
the "subordinates" become "superordinates" and there are no real
"subordinates" at
all,
Mueller goes even further
if he states cate-
gorically that "relations of subordination in the enterprise" are es-
sentially "not authority relations" (158, p. 171). "The thesis
.
.
.
that the enterprise is a ^sphere of authority' must ...
be rejected,"
Mueller
asserts
(p.
172), although
a
little
later he remarks
that
"super- and subordination in industrial organization is essential to the
enterprise"
(p.
173).
This
latter remark shows quite clearly that
Mueller is concerned not with the fact but with the concept of author-
ity. The same holds for Neuloh, who states with excessive caution at
the end of his work:
"It would seem to be a general conviction that
total coordination
[i.e., total lack of subordination—R.D.]
is impos-
sible in any kind of enterprise, particularly in the industrial enter-
prise," since this would "involve the abolition of hierarchies in the
enterprise, i.e., of any discipline and authority" ( 1 60, p. 249)
. This is,
indeed, not merely general conviction, but an indispensable condition
of the structure of the enterprise. By contrast,
it is "general convic-
tion" that Mueller's "super- and subordination" and Neuloh's "dis-
cipline and authority" describe authority relations in the strict sense
of the term, and that there is no reason not to call them by this name.
Schelsky rightly emphasizes the "particular authority foundation" of
the industrial enterprise as distinct from such structures as are founded
on technical requirements (164, p. 87).
"Wherever enterprises are
set up, a few command and many obey," Bendix states as a matter of
course in the second sentence of his work on industrial authority (138,
p.
i).
Later he repeats more specifically:
"All economic enterprises

----- Page 269 (native) -----
Classes in Post-Capitalist Society (I)
2 Si
have in common a basic social relation between the employers who
exercise authority and the workers who obey" (p. 13). However one
may resent the word authority, substantively there can be no doubt
that industrial enterprises are at all times and in all places imperatively
coordinated associations.
In this sense Mueller
is involuntarily right
when he refers to Marx and remarks
: "Even Karl Marx had to admit
*A11 immediate social or communal labor on a larger scale requires
more or less leadership.
.
.
. An individual violinist conducts him-
self, but an orchestra requires a conductor' " (158, p. 170).
Since the industrial enterprise has an authority structure and
is
therefore an imperatively coordinated association, we are entitled to
assume that the incumbents of positions of domination and subjection
within it are united in two conflicting quasi-groups with certain latent
interests. This inference follows from the model of class formation.
If the theory of group conflict proves useful, its validity is as universal
as the imperative character of the enterprise itself.
Wherever there
are industrial enterprises, there is a quasi-group of the incumbents of
roles of domination, the latent interests of which are in conflict with
those of a corresponding quasi-group of incumbents of roles of sub-
jection.
If W. E. Moore states that "the interests of management and
labor may be 'basically the same,' and yet the relations between the two
groups be anything but harmonious"
( 1 57, p. 400) and adds that "in
a complete absence of like interests, there can be no conflict: there
is
nothing to fight about" (p. 399), he merely expresses the fact of the
two faces of society with specific reference to the enterprise.
Like all
other units of social structure, industrial enterprises may be described
in terms of integration theory. Their stability presents itself, then, as
based on a "common value system" or "common interests."
But for
certain purposes of analysis this approach
is insufficient j we need the
parallel approach of coercion theory.
From the point of view of
coercion theory, however, the interests of the incumbents of different
authority positions appear as conflicting.
Thus, Taylor's "firm con-
viction that the true interests of the two [management and labor]
are one and the same" (167, p. 10), that employers and workers are
not opponents but partners, does not constitute an objection to class
analysis.
As opposed to Taylor, we do not postulate any "true in-
terests." We merely assert that Taylor's exclusive emphasis on the
community of interests among
all
participants of the enterprise
is
plainly insufficient for the explanation of certain phenomena, such as
strikes, and that it is therefore necessary to assume a conflict of latent

----- Page 270 (native) -----
252
classes in Post-Cafitalist Society (I)
interests in the enterprise emerging from the differential distribution
of authority.
Speaking of "common interests," Taylor and others usually spec-
ify the substance of these interests: "In the ordinary course of affairs
it is mutually advantageous to management and labor for an industrial
establishment to continue in operation" (Moore, 157, p. 400). Anal-
ogously, the question of the substance of conflicting latent interests in
industry must be raised. This question may appear unnecessarily ab-
stract at a time at which everybody knows that the conflict of interests
between employers and workers manifests itself in the form of dis-
putes over wages and
conditions of work.
Yet
it
is questionable
whether the substantive
interest
in higher wages or higher
profits
defines the substance of the latent interests of industrial classes suffi-
ciently clearly.
In an acute argument Drucker has tried to reduce
wage disputes to their "real basis": "The wage rate is the traditional
symbol for the real conflict rather than the issue itself. The basic prob-
lem is a conflict between the enterprise's view of wage as cost, and the
employee's view of wage as income. The real issue
is not, properly
speaking, an economic one, but one over the nature and function of
wage: shall the need of the enterprise or the need of the employee
be the basis for determining the function of wage?" (144, p. 58).
Drucker comes close to our problem, but not quite close enough.
In
reducing known manifest interests to latent interests at their basis we
must abstract even further from substantive contents connected with
specific social conditions.
"It
is clear that a
conflict
is always con-
cerned with a distribution of power. An exertion of power is necessary
in order to retain a share in the determination of future relations, as
well as for the acquisition or retention of other benefits which may be
the immediate ^reasons' for the conflict.
This
is to say that the im-
mediate and necessary goal of any conflict
is complete or partial vic-
tory" (Moore, 157, p. 400).
If we formulate, as we must, the latent
interests of industrial quasi-groups on an equally formal and general
level as the "common interest" in the continued operation of the en-
terprise, their substance can be described as the maintenance or change
of the status quo by conservation or modification of existing relations
of authority.
In disputes between trade unions and employers, an argument
is
often put forward by the employers which has found
its way into
sociological literature also. Employers like to assert that they repre-
sent the interests of the total enterprise whereas the unions merely
stand for partial interests.
It might appear that there is no convincing

253
refutation of this argument.* However, in the light of the theory of
group conflict
it becomes apparent what the basis of this argument is
and why it is ideological, i.e., demonstrably false—a fact which
is of
considerable significance for class analysis. We have seen earlier that
the interests of a ruling group assume, as ruling interests, the char-
acter of accepted values in a unit of social structure. They are a re-
flection of the real structure, the existing conditions, although these
are upheld and guaranteed by the rule of but one class. They might
therefore appear as binding for all elements of a unit of social struc-
ture. Yet the theory of class exposes the fact that the existing condi-
tions are themselves in a sense merely "partial," that they exist by
virtue of the authority of one part, or class. As the prime minister is
both representative of the whole nation and exponent of the majority
party, the entrepreneur
is both "the enterprise" and one partial in-
terest in the conflicts generated by
its structure—depending on the
image of society underlying our analysis. In this sense, "conservation"
and "modification" of a status quo are, from the coercion point of
view, strictly equivalent "partial" interests the conflict of which can
be conceived as one of the determinants of the dynamics of social
structure.
Two objections are frequently raised these days against the uni-
versal reality of conflicting latent interests in industry. They are easily
disposed of, yet it may further clarify the issue to discuss them briefly.
The first of these objections is based on the thesis that what
is often
called the "bourgeoisification of the proletariat,"
i.e., the improve-
ment of the economic situation of industrial workers, makes the as-
sumption of continuing conflict unreasonable and, indeed, nonsensical.
If, it is argued, the workers are no longer proletarians, if they do not
live in poverty and suppression, they no longer have reason to revolt
against their employers. The public of post-capitalist societies realizes,
with baffled surprise, the continued reality of strikes and yet insists, at
the same time, on the theory that industrial conflict has lost its causes
and issues where the standard of living is high. This paradox testifies
to a remarkable consistency of conviction, if not to insight. The theory
of group conflict does not postulate any connection between class con-
flict and economic conditions. For the emergence of social conflicts the
standard of living of their participants
is in principle irrelevant, for
conflicts are ultimately generated by relations of authority, i.e., by the

it
difficult to argue against
this point, except by dogmatic insistence on their power.

differentiation of dominating and subjected groups.
Even
if every
worker owns a car, a house, and whatever other comforts of civilization
there are, the root of industrial class conflict is not only not eliminated,
but hardly touched. The fact that economic demands may provide
the substance (a substance situationally specific and in that sense in-
cidental) of manifest interests must not give
rise to the erroneous
notion that satisfaction of these demands eliminates the causes of con-
flict.
Social conflict is as universal as the relations of authority and im-
peratively coordinated associations, for it is the distribution of author-
ity that provides the basis and cause of its occurrence.
A second objection against the assumption of the persistence of a
latent conflict of interest consists in the thesis that the replacement of
capitalists by managers has removed the basis of industrial class con-
flict. Upon closer inspection, this thesis, too, proves untenable. As we
have seen, latent interests can be conceived of as quasi-objective role
expectations. They are held not by persons, but by positions, or by
persons only insofar as they occupy certain positions.
If a person oc-
cupies a position of domination
in an enterprise,
it
is irrelevant
in
principle^ whether his authority
is based on property, election by a
board of directors, or appointment by a government agency.
For the
latent interests of the incumbents of positions of authority, their in-
cumbency of these positions is the sole significant factor.
Although,
therefore, their modes of recruitment and bases of legitimacy make
for significant differences between capitalist and manager in other con-
texts, their authority positions in the enterprise are alike, and their
places in conflicts of interest identical. For the explanation of group
conflict, the factual relations of authority are the crucial factor. To this
extent I agree with Burnham's thesis and with Marx's and Renner's
analysis of joint-stock companies j
the replacement of functioning
owners or capitalists by propertyless functionaries or managers does
not abolish class conflict, but merely changes its empirical patterns.
In-
dependent of the particular personnel of positions of authority, in-
dustrial enterprises remain imperatively coordinated associations the
structures of which generate quasi-groups and conflicting latent in-
terests.

derline between the quasi-groups of industrial associations.
Bendix
remarks that in every enterprise there are "a few" who command and
"many" who obey.
Presumably, he has the capitalist enterprise
in
mind when he says so. But the same criticism applies to his statement
as was raised against Pareto's and Mosca's thesis of a ruling "mi-
nority." In the enterprises of post-capitalist society, authority is typi-
cally no longer exercised by one individual, or even by a few. A com-
plex system of delegation of responsibility
obliterates virtually
to
invisibility the dividing line between positions of domination and sub-
jection. Even if we ignore for the moment the place of labor repre-
sentatives in the formal organization of the enterprise, there are two
groups that stubbornly resist allocation to one or the other quasi-group.
One of these consists of the so-called "staff" of the enterprise, the en-
gineers, chemists, physicists, lawyers, psychologists, and other special-
ists whose services have become an indispensable part of production in
modern firms.
Occasionally, these specialists have a defined place in
the scalar structure of authority in the enterprise, usually by the in-
clusion of specialist qualifications in the definition of the expectations
associated with managerial
roles."
More frequently, however, the
staff is linked with the line of authority by an intricate system of cross-
relations without its members having immediate authority except over
their secretaries and assistants ("line-staff system").
In this case the
class situation of specialists in the enterprise remains as uncertain as
the class situation of intellectuals in society. They are neither super-
ordinates nor subordinates j their positions seem to stand beyond the
authority structure. Only insofar as they can be identified as (often
indirect) helpers of management, can they be called a marginal part
of the ruling class of the enterprise.
The number of staff positions in industrial enterprises
is usually
fairly limited. But there is another troublesome group of positions in
the modern enterprise which is far more numerous, namely that of all
salaried employees, of department heads and typists, accountants, and
foremen, etc. Few of these positions can be described as positions of
subjection in the sense in which those of workers are.
But are they
positions of domination?
Do salaried employees participate
in the
exercise of authority? Do they belong to the ruling class of the in-
dustrial
enterprise?

portance. The latter clearly belong to the quasi-group of the subjected
and do not therefore present a special problem.
But what about the
bureaucrats?
In the following chapter we shall have to investigate
the place of bureaucrats in social conflict rather more extensively. An-
ticipating the result of this investigation, however, I think that with
certain qualifications the conclusion
is indicated and, indeed, forced
upon us that the positions of bureaucrats in the enterprise have to be
counted among the positions of domination. The theory advanced by
Renner and others since the turn of the century, and called "theory of
delegation" by Croner, provides the only consistent explanation of the
authority position (although not of the social status or economic situa-
tion! ) of bureaucratic roles.
Bureaucratic roles in the enterprise must
be described as difFerentiated management roles. The total process
of the exercise of authority appears, in the modern enterprise, sub-
divided into a multitude of positions coordinated by a peculiar type of
organization.
In the analysis of bureaucratic roles below we shall see
that this subdivision and coordination bears striking similarities to the
division of labor in technical production. In both cases, differentiation
has the efFect of splitting up a totality into a multitude of elements to
the extent of almost entirely alienating each of the elements from the
totality of which it is a part. Here, appearances are deceptive, for the
fact remains that industrial bureaucracy or, as Renner calls this group,
the "service class," stands as a whole on this side of the borderline
which separates the possessors of authority in the enterprise from the
subjected workers, both manual and white-collar. By virtue of their
positions, bureaucrats are members of the ruling class of industry and
share its latent interests.^
It may appear superfluous to devote so extensive a discussion to
the structural origins of industrial conflict in view of the fact that the
organized interest groups of trade unions and employers' associations
belong to the accepted institutions of post-capitalist society.
Yet this
appearance is deceptive. Only if we manage to identify the structural
origins of industrial conflict unambiguously can we hope to be able to
assess the place of organized interest groups in post-capitalist society
with sufiicient accuracy. The authority structure of the industrial en-
terprise generates, in every social order and at all times, independent
of the socio-economic status of labor and the modes of recruitment of

the point of

management, latent interests and quasi-groups in the sense of class
theory. Their conflict may be described as the ultimate source of class
antagonisms in industry. At the same time, this statement leaves out
of consideration whether industrial conflict becomes acute or remains
latent, whether
it assumes regulated patterns or
is of the civil-war
type, whether it is confined to industry or molds the whole of society.
Empirically, these are the crucial questions, and the answers to them
cannot be derived from the authority structure of the enterprise. For
them to be satisfactorily answered, we now have to look at the em-
pirical conditions of industrial conflict in post-capitalist society.
INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY
In connection with the brief re-analysis of Marx's data above,
I
have indicated that there is a tendency toward decreasing intensity and
violence in industrial conflict by virtue of the "institutionalization of
class conflict" and the development of "industrial democracy."
This
assertion must now be made specific and documented.
Without en-
tering into a detailed historical account of the development of con-
flict patterns in various countries, I shall try in this section to trace some
of the typical (and universal) elements of conflict regulation in in-
dustry as they aflFect the violence of manifestations of conflict. My
thesis is that in post-capitalist society industrial conflict has become less
violent because its existence has been accepted and
its manifestations
have been socially regulated. Today, industrial conflict
is recognized
as a necessary feature of industrial life.
This recognition, as well as
the establishment of regulatory
institutions,
constitutes
in
itself a
structure change which
is due to no small extent to the efi^ects of in-
dustrial
conflict.
The establishment of "industrial democracy" consists of a number
of structural arrangements, each of which warrants brief inspection.
In the following pages, I propose to analyze five elements of industrial
democracy in advanced countries which seem to me of particular im-
portance: (i) the organization of conflicting interest groups itself j
(2) the establishment of "parliamentary" negotiating bodies in which
these groups meet j (3) the institutions of mediation and arbitration
j
(4) formal representations of labor within the individual enterprise j
and (5) tendencies towards an institutionalization of workers' partici-
pation in industrial management. The purpose of the following anal-
ysis, as of the whole chapter,
is to stimulate thought and research
rather than to present conclusive solutions j thus, we shall concentrate
on significant facts rather than present all relevant data.

classes in Post-Capitalist Society (I)
( I )
In the sphere of industry we encounter the conflicting classes
in full formation. In a way, the conditions of industry in post-capital-
ist society might be described as an empirical analogue of the model of
class theory, an ideal type come true. The authority structure of the
enterprise generates the two quasi-groups of management and labor,
along with their latent interests j from these are recruited the interest
groups of employers' associations and trade unions, with their specific
manifest interests. For many decades, now, the disputes between trade
unions and employers' associations have presented the well-known
picture of industrial conflict.
There are a number of problems in connection with the formation
of industrial classes which, although well worth investigating, we can
only touch upon here,
(a) It would be interesting to investigate why
trade unions typically attempt to recruit
all members of the quasi-
group of labor into their organization ("closed shop") and to actual-
ize their interests permanently, whereas employers' associations are
much looser organizations composed of a few representatives of their
underlying quasi-group.
One would have to inquire whether
this
pattern indicates a general regularity of manifest conflict, or whether
it might not be conceivable that a subjected class is also represented by
a small interest group of delegates.^
(h) Complex problems are raised
by the relation between employers' associations and industrial bureau-
crats, particularly their union-type organizations, if we introduce the
premise that the service class is part of the ruling class,
(c) In many
countries, the relation between different (often conflicting)
interest
groups based on the same quasi-group, such as Christian and Socialist
trade unions, presents important problems,
(d)
Finally, we cannot
here discuss the extremely significant consequences of the
fact that
organized trade unions are themselves imperatively coordinated as-
sociations which potentially generate within themselves the same con-
flicts between dominant and subjected groups ("bosses" and members)
as other associations.
Other problems might be added to these. However, we are here
concerned merely with a more limited question:
in what sense does
even the organization of conflict groups itself contribute to a decrease
in the intensity and violence of class conflicts?
It is worth pursuing the
* There
is some
indication today
that
trade unions develop from membership
organizations
to
offices staffed with
a few functionaries who professionally represent
the interests of labor.
It
is just possible that the trade union of the future will look
more like American than like European political parties,
i.e., that
it will be a "latent"
organization actuated only for special purposes.

subject that every act of organization
is as such a process of institu-
tionalization. The organization of an interest group creates an entity
in time, endowed with a "charter," certain norms, a material instru-
mentarium, and a personnel that constitute—if we accept Malinow-
ski's definition—an institution.
This fact has certain prerequisites j
and certain consequences flow from it. Thus, the organization of trade
unions presupposes, apart from the presence of a quasi-group of latent
interests, those technical, political, and social conditions which we have
described as conditions of organization and the presence of which sig-
nifies in itself a minimum of recognition of the legitimacy of conflict
and its issues. The organization of trade unions
is in this sense the
first structure change of industrial society caused by class conflict j by
its completion class conflict loses some of
its intensity and violence.
This conclusion is supported by the consequences of the organiza-
tion of interest groups.
Organized groups stand in open, and there-
fore in controllable,
conflict.
As long as the organizations of sub-
jected groups are not dissolved, their political prerequisites not abol-
ished, absolute suppression of this class
is no longer possible.
Or-
ganized interest groups of subjected classes have means to enforce
recognition of their interests at their disposal j moreover, they are in
principle
accessible for negotiations,
i.e., regulated
disputes.
One
cannot negotiate with unorganized, loosely connected "rebels" 3
for
conciliation comprehensive organization growing out of a quasi-group
is indispensable.
Thus, the conclusion
is suggested that the "democ-
ratization" of industrial conflict begins with the organization of in-
dustrial classes.
(2)
In fact the formation of industrial interest groups has soon
been followed, in all industrial countries, by the emergence of ne-
gotiating bodies in which the representatives of both parties convene
for settling their disputes by discussion.
In some countries these ne-
gotiating bodies, originally formed ad hoc whenever necessary, have
stabilized into persistent institutions j there is a machinery for collec-
tive bargaining and
joint
negotiation.
"The term
^collective
bar-
gaining' is applied to those arrangements under which the wages and
conditions of employment are settled by a bargain, in the form of an
agreement made between employers or associations of employers and
workpeople's organizations" (156,
p.
15).
The structure of these
negotiating bodies differs in different countries. "The area regulated
by collective contract
is, for example, much wider in America than in
Germany.
In the latter country many of the relations between em-
ployer and employee are regulated on the basis of mutual under-

classes in Post-Cafitalist Society (I)
standing without
this anywhere being put down in writing j many
other conditions are fixed preferably by law and less by collective con-
tracts" (McPherson, 155, p. 69).
Apart from this latter qualifica-
tion, the significance of collective bargaining for industrial conflict
can be asserted in general for all post-capitalist societies.
Occasional or statutory negotiating bodies of employers' associa-
tions and trade unions serve a quasi-parliamentary function in indus-
trial class conflict.
In them the representatives of both parties meet
in order to articulate their disputes on the basis of certain rules of the
game (such as an order of procedure, but also according to other norms
and forms of behavior)® and, if possible, to arrive at a common de-
cision. T. H. Marshall has demonstrated convincingly how radically
this structural principle differs from a private-law conception of the
labor contract (cf. 57). For us, the essential fact is that by collective
bargaining the frozen fronts of industrial conflict are thawed.
If the
representatives of management and labor meet regularly for ne-
gotiations, gradual changes of social structure replace the tendency
toward revolutionary explosions and civil war.
(3)
However, this possibility
is by no means entirely removed
where collective bargaining bodies exist. The rules of the game of
political democracy can only partly be applied to the industrial con-
flict of interests. "The whole of this collective system rests upon the
principle of mutual consent, and the value of the agreements and the
machinery for settling disputes has depended upon the loyal accept-
ance by the constituent members on both sides of the decisions reached"
(156, p. 16). Not only the acceptance of agreements once reached,
but even more the difficulty of reaching agreement endangers the ef-
fectiveness of conciliation.
Majority decisions are structurally im-
possible
in
the
negotiating
bodies of employers'
associations and
unions; decisions are reached unanimously or not at all. To the extent
to which agreement between conflict groups cannot be attained by ne-
gotiation, industrial
conflict threatens the democratic process
itself.
Violent
conflict— strike and lockout—remains
its background and,
often, its result.
In order to remove the possibility of outbreak of violent conflict
even further, most advanced
industrial
societies have developed a
^ These are nicely brought out when a bitter wage dispute which has no result
ends in an exchange such as that found in the minutes of an English negotiation which
1 have analyzed elsewhere (42), where the union representative
(a man known
for
his radical views)
says, "I presume we say Good morning then!" and the employers'
representative replies, "I am
sorry, Mr. T."

second line of institutional safeguards, a system of mediation and
arbitration.
It is the declared aim of arbitration to make a last non-
violent attempt at regulating conflicts in case of breakdown of con-
ciliation.
In connection with the general discussion of conflict regu-
lation I have presented a schema of types of third-party interference
in conflict, ranging from (voluntary) mediation through (partly com-
pulsory) arbitration to compulsory arbitration.
Apart from the last
type, such interference may operate as an effective means of reducing
the violence of industrial conflict. There are many empirical illustra-
tions of this fact. However, for arbitration to be effective,
it is neces-
sary that
it be based on the acceptance of the conflict itself,
i.e., that
it follow a political rather than a legal conception of
its task, to use
Lockwood's distinction (cf. 86).
If, and only if, mediation and arbi-
tration are conceived of as mechanisms for facilitating legitimate de-
cision-making on the part of both parties to a conflict, do they con-
tribute to industrial democracy.
(4) The three factors mentioned so far form a coherent pattern.
Its rationale lies in the autonomous, in that sense democratic, regula-
tion of conflict.
This pattern can be found in most post-capitalist so-
cieties, but particularly in Britain and the United States. The two
remaining factors, representation within the enterprise and co-deter-
mination, also form a coherent pattern.
Again, traces of the pattern
are present in most industrial countries, but
it
is particularly promi-
nent in Germany.
Its most general principle can be described as the
attempt to institutionalize industrial conflict by modifying the author-
ity structure of the enterprise itself.
So far as we can see today, the
range of variability of possible modifications of the authority structure
of the industrial enterprise
is relatively limited.^"
Yet there
is the
possibility of supplementing the authority structure by what Schelsky
called an "institutionalized side-hierarchy of employees' representa-
tives" (165,
p.
187), such
as shop stewards, comites d^entreprisey
Betriebsratey or, in Communist countries, party cells in the enterprise.
Schelsky states on the basis of this important structure change of mod-
ern industry that "a dualistic authority structure belongs to the hierar-
chical constitution of the modern enterprise" (165,
p.
185).
It
is
worth following up some of the consequences of this development for
violence and intensity of industrial conflict.
In Germany, labor representation within the enterprise found its

is brought out with great clarity by Bendix in his study of in-
dustrial authority (138).

Classes in Post-Capitalist Society (I)
way into legislation as early as 1920.
Special legislation defines the
task of shop councils" by two main expectations.
Shop councils are
established "in order to defend the common economic interests of
employees
.
.
. vis-a-vis the employer, and in order to support the
employer in realizing the functions of the enterprise." The striking
ambiguity of the position of shop councils—and, to a lesser extent, of
British and American shop stewards—becomes apparent in this formu-
lation. The first part of the legal definition, ascribing to shop councils
the task of defending the interests of labor, seems to bear out Schel-
sky's and Drucker's comparison of this institution with a parliamentary
opposition. From this point of view, the institution of shop councils
neither modifies nor supplements the authority structure of the en-
terprise j leaders of opposition have no legitimate power within the
state. There is, however, a second aspect of the position of shop coun-
cils.
Apart from defending the interests of labor, shop councilors
have also to give certain commands to the workers j they have to "sup-
port the employer in realizing the functions of the enterprise." More
apparently than with the shop stewards of English and American in-
dustry, German shop councils occupy a curiously ambiguous place in
the enterprise. They are both opposition and side-government, rep-
resentatives of the interests of labor and agents of management. For
this reason, much the same problems are associated with their roles as
Roethlisberger and others found characteristic for the foreman.
At
least in Germany, the shop councilors are, even more than the fore-
man, "men in the middle," "masters and victims of double talk."^^
In so far as the representation of labor within the enterprise fol-
lows the double definition of German shop councils,
its effect on the
intensity and violence of industrial conflict is as ambivalent as its posi-
tion in the authority structure of the enterprise. On the one hand, class
theory would lead one to assume that the establishment of institutions
designed to "defend the common economic interests of employees"
serves to reduce the violence of conflict by providing peaceful chan-
nels of expression for antagonistic interests. On the other hand, the
^^ The German term Betriebsrat will
in the following analysis be translated by
"shop council," so
as to avoid confusion with the shop steward system, which
is dif-
ferent in several respects. The following quotation stems from the Betriebsrätegesetz
of 1920, section
i of which defines the functions of shop councils.
^^ This situation
is most pronounced in German industry.
However, the com-
parative analyses by McPherson (155) and A. Philip
(161, Chapter
II) show that
shop stewards and comites i*entrefrise also serve certain managerial functions, so that
the present analysis applies to other countries as well.

263
very design of shop councils tends to alienate this institution from
those whose interests it is supposed to serve. By necessity, the repre-
sentatives of labor get entangled with the tasks, decisions, and—at
least indirectly—interests of management. What appears to be an
interest group of the subjected turns out to be an agent of the domi-
nating group as well.
It seems probable that this kind of perverted
conflict regulation will increase rather than diminish both the violence
and the intensity of conflict by simultaneously opening and blocking
one of its channels of expression.
This latter point
is most clearly illustrated by the relationship of
labor representatives within the individual enterprise to the larger or-
ganizations of labor, i.e., the trade unions.
In England and the United
States "shop stewards are appointed by and subject to the control of
their unions" (156, p. 66). They are in this sense delegates of the
comprehensive interest group of labor within the enterprise. As such,
they are symptom and tool of the institutionalization of class conflict
and serve to decrease its violence. Although in actual fact there are in
Germany, also, many enterprises where the trade unions have at least
informal control over selection, election, and work of the shop coun-
cils, these are in principle independent of the unions. There are there-
fore at least two distinct interest groups of labor,^^ the relations be-
tween which may be friendly, competitive, or conflicting. The theory
of group conflict would suggest that the closer the connection between
labor representatives
in the
enterprise and comprehensive
interest
groups, the better do these
interest groups serve
their purpose of
regulating industrial conflict and thereby reducing
its violence. The
shop councilor, as an incumbent of roles of domination, becomes part
of the ruling class of industry, deprives labor of one of
its channels
of expression, and provides the cause for new conflicts of the class type
within the enterprise and industry as a whole.
(5)
This conclusion holds a fortiori for a final element of indus-
trial democracy which we have to discuss and which, once again, is most
prominent in West German industry:
workers' participation in man-
agement.
Apart from strictly syndicalist tendencies in a number of

interest group but

merely the head of an otherwise nonexistent group. What happens
is that the compre-

the same time split up into innumerable smaller units and recruiting fields within the

historical and contemporary societies, the coal, iron, and steel industry
of post-war Germany provides the
first large-scale example of an
attempt to furnish labor with a share in the management of indus-
trial enterprises. There have been numerous studies, sociological and
otherwise,
of
the German
co-determination experiment
in
recent
years, and I do not intend to review here these investigations or the
problems they have raised.
There
is, however, one element of co-
determination which
is of immediate relevance for our problem and
requires some consideration.
One of the crucial stipulations of the
"Law Concerning Co-Determination of Employees in the Boards of
Directors and of Executives in the Enterprises of Coal Mining and
the Iron and Steel Industry of May 21st, 1951" relates to the in-
clusion of a labor representative in the executive board.
Section 13
of the third part of the law, dealing with executive boards,
says:
"i. A labor manager {Arbeitsdirektor) is appointed with rights equal
to those of the other members of the legally representative executive
board. The labor manager cannot be appointed against the votes of
those members of the board of directors elected in accordance with
section 6
[i.e., the representatives of labor in the board of directors
—R.D.]. ...
2.
The labor manager, like the other members of
the legally representative executive board, has to fulfill his tasks in
close cooperation with the total board." What are the structural con-
sequences for industrial conflict of this stipulation, and the real con-
ditions created on its basis?
Two conclusions can immediately be derived from the wording
of the law.
First, this law stipulates the creation of a new position.
It does not define in any detail the role, the behavior expectations
attached to this position. However, its designation "labor manager"
implies an indication that the legislators had in mind an executive
who
is primarily concerned with personnel matters
in
the widest
sense. ^* The law states quite explicitly, however, that the role of the
labor manager is a role of domination, a leadership or management
role equipped "with equal rights." The position of labor manager
is clearly defined as belonging to the ensemble of positions endowed
with the right to issue authoritative decisions and commands.
Sec-
ondly, the wording of the law stipulates a mode of recruitment of
persons to this position. Here, again, the text remains purely formal.
It is not suggested, e.g., that the labor manager has to be a (former)
^* To the present day, the German trade unions eagerly disclaim
this implica-
tion, which,
in their opinion, puts the labor manager at a disadvantage with his col-
leagues.
Despite this fact, I should maintain my interpretation.

265
worker or trade union member, although this idea may have played
a part.
It is merely said that he must have the confidence of the labor
representatives on the board of directors, that he cannot be appointed
against their votes.
What, then,
is the class position of the labor
manager in terms of conflict theory?
With respect to his position and role, and quite apart from
its
specific incumbent, the answer to this question is evident. As a posi-
tion of domination
it belongs to the plus-side of the zero-sum dis-
tribution of authority positions in the enterprise j the position of labor
manager
is, to
all intents and purposes, a managerial or entrepre-
neurial position. "Like the other members of the legally representa-
tive executive board," the labor manager belongs, by virtue of his
position,
to
the ruling quasi-group of those whose
objective role
interests aim at the maintenance of existing conditions.
In this sense,
the institution of labor manager is, as Pirker justly observes, "nothing
but the continuation of the process of rationalization of large-scale
enterprises and of the specialization and centralization of manage-
ment connected with it" (162, p. 417). Like his older, but similarly
defined, colleague in English and American industry, the personnel
manager, the labor manager is an entrepreneur.
These facts, which are so obvious that
it
is truly surprising how
rarely they are recognized, are complicated by that further
stipu-
lation of the law which prescribes a mode of recruitment.
In order
to articulate the consequences of this prescription, let us assume hypo-
thetically the extreme case of a worker—say, a fitter—who
is also an
active unionist, being appointed labor manager of a steelworks by
its board of directors. From the point of view of class theory, this
means, in the first place, that a man who belongs to the quasi-group
of the subjected becomes mobile, rises socially, and assumes a position
that automatically puts him into the quasi-group of the rulers.
His
latent interests change from one extreme to the other.
This seem-
ingly nonsensical statement becomes reasonable
if we
realize
that
latent interests are associated with
positions, not persons, and that
they are therefore in principle exchangeable with positions. The in-
dividual can abandon his
class position,
as he can his occupational
position. Our fitter has become, by the decision of a board of direc-
tors, an entrepreneur.
His interests are no longer represented by a
trade union but by an employers' association.
Once again we must
agree with Pirker, who says: "Enforcing loyalty with the union would
be incompatible with the functions
[better: the role—R.D.] of the
labor manager which are, and must be, directed towards the optimal

----- Page 284 (native) -----

Classes in Post-Capitalist Society (I)
social constitution of the enterprise within the existing economic and
social order" (162, p. 420).
In one respect our analysis might be charged with a certain lack
of realism. One might ask how the fitter of our example will react
to his new role. Will he be able or willing to forget, once he is labor
manager, that he was a fitter before?
This is a psychological question.
However,
it appears to me that we may formulate a number of al-
ternatives of behavior that are open to the newly made labor man-
ager of our hypothetical example,
(a) He may try to continue acting
as if he were a member of the subjected class from which he came.
This would mean that he does not adapt himself to his new role and
does not fulfill its tasks as he should, so that he may be a good unionist
but will certainly be a bad labor manager,
{b) On the other hand,
he may try to adapt himself to his new role very rapidly (and succeed
in doing so).
By forgetting his
origin he may indeed become an
extreme example of an industrial ruler and soon display all the status
symbols of a manager,
{c) Finally—and this may be the most prob-
able case—our
fitter may gradually adapt himself to
his new role
as labor manager, live through what may easily be a painful conflict
between the old and the new role, and try to solve this conflict by
increased efforts on behalf of his former colleagues (thereby doing
what
is his task, as a labor manager, in any case). He becomes an
entrepreneur, a member of the ruling class of industry, but he re-
mains an employer concerned about the welfare of labor.
I have deliberately tried to assess the significance of co-determi-
nation in the light of class theory without reference to the unending
discussion of the virtue or vice of this structure change.
This, it seems
to me,
is the only way of gaining an impression unbiased by wishes
or aversions.
Thus, the much-discussed problem of the "conflict of
loyalties" (union vs. enterprise)
is reduced to the psychological con-
flict of a man—who in reality is a rare exception^^—who turns over-
^^ No exact
figures are
available about
the origin of
the* (roughly
loo)
labor
managers
in West Germany.
There
are, however, some
figures about
the occupa-
tions of labor representatives on the boards of directors
(170,
p.
l).
According
to
these, of the representatives in
all co-determination enterprises
in 1955, 22 per cent
were trade union employees, 24.8 per cent higher salaried employees, managers, civil
servants, cabinet ministers, members of parliament etc.
(persons, in other words, who
were in leading positions before), 7.
i per cent experts (professors, lawyers, etc.), 14
per cent bureaucrats, 31.5 per cent skilled workers and foremen, and 0.6 per cent
semiskilled workers.
Here, our hypothetical case would not be
typical,
but neither
would
it be exceptional.
However,
it
is more than likely that the proportion of former
workers
is much smaller among the labor managers.

night from worker to entrepreneur. Neuloh's "totally bilateral proc-
ess of decision-making" (160, p. 58)
is revealed as an extremely in-
accurate description of the actual conditions.
But
it becomes evident,
also, that the large number of workers who (according to a survey
of the Frankfurt Institute of Social Research)
expect from co-de-
termination "equal participation in decision-making" or even "rights
of control and veto on the part of labor" (149, p. 212), are voicing
Utopian wishes rather than structurally justified expectations.
In many ways, co-determination in the basic industries of West
Germany
is the most
insignificant of the
factors of industrial de-
mocracy discussed in this section.
This conclusion certainly holds for
the creation of the position of labor manager. The strengthening of
shop councils effected by a supplementary law of 1952 as well as the
participation of labor representatives in the boards of directors stipu-
lated by the co-determination law may be regarded as contributions
to the effective regulation of industrial
conflict.
Here, negotiating
bodies are erected or invigorated which serve to remove conflict from
the streets to conference rooms.
But the very significance of institu-
tions of this latter type supports our general view that any attempt
to eliminate conflict altogether
is bound to fail as such and, in fact,
intensifies existing cleavages.
Regulation requires acceptance of con-
flict j but co-determination is based on a conviction that conflict is bad
and must be abolished. From the point of view of effective conflict
regulation,
it
is an ill-conceived pattern that contradicts rather than
supports a general trend toward the reduction of violence and
in-
tensity of industrial conflict.
THE INSTITUTIONAL ISOLATION OF INDUSTRY AND
INDUSTRIAL CONFLICT
"I
believe,"
says Parsons
in one
place,
"that
class
conflict
is
endemic in our modern industrial type of society" (67, p. 333). With
respect to industry, our analysis suggests that
this belief
is indeed
well-founded. But while the existence of class conflict is indubitable,
its manifestations have changed. The analysis of industrial democ-
racy reveals some such changes, namely, those in the violence of inter-
est clashes. At several points we have suggested that with decreasing
violence the intensity of industrial conflict was also reduced. How-
ever, the latter tendency is rather less apparent than the former.
It
is necessary, here, to define
its extent and limits as precisely as pos-
sible.
In this problem, the relationship between industry and society
is crucial.

----- Page 286 (native) -----

Classes in Post-Capitalist Society (I)
We have seen that one of the reasons why industrial conflict was
exceptionally intense in capitalist society rested with the fact that the
lines of industrial and political conflict were superimposed. The op-
ponents of industry—capital and labor—met again,
as bourgeoisie
and proletariat, in the political arena.
Clearly, the relations between
industry and society are close in all modern societies j
in this sense,
the term "industrial society"
is fitting.
At the same time, industry
and society are, at least for purposes of analysis, discrete associations,
the interrelations between which are not a priori definable.
It is one
of the central theses of the present analysis that
in post-capitalist
society industry and society have, by contrast to capitalist society, been
dissociated.
Increasingly, the social relations of industry, including
industrial conflict, do not dominate the whole of society but remain
confined in their patterns and problems to the sphere of industry.
Industry and industrial conflict are, in post-capitalist society, institu-
tionally
isolated,
i.e., confined within the borders of their proper
realm and robbed of their influence on other spheres of society.
In
post-capitalist society, the industrial enterprise is no longer the model
after which all other relations are fashioned. From this thesis (which,
for this reason, one might call a "theory" by contrast to the "propo-
sitions" or "hypotheses" derived from
it)
a number of significant
consequences follov/ for class analysis.
Before we consider these in
some detail, however, the theory itself requires some elucidation.
At an earlier point in this study we have described three sets of
facts which would seem to suggest that Marx and Burnham are right
in believing industry and society to be virtually identical in the modern
world. The first of these was the purely physical extent of industry
and industrial enterprises as well as the manifest significance of indus-
trial production for life in contemporary society. Whatever changes
may have occurred with respect to the relation of industry and society,
they have evidently supported rather than contradicted this tendency.
In ever larger enterprises an ever growing number of workers pro-
duces ever more numerous goods.
Yet this fact does not contradict
the theory of institutional isolation of industry, as will become ap-
parent if we look at the other two factors mentioned in our earlier
analysis. We have stated there that the occupational role dominates
the social position of people in industrial society, and in particular
that of workers. Here, a counter-trend cannot be ignored. The time
spent by the average worker on his job has decreased and will probably
continue to decrease.
Although his work plays a prominent part in
the daily life of the worker, there are indications that other roles

----- Page 287 (native) -----
Classes in Post-Capitalist Society (I)
269
besides his occupation gain in importance.
In a sense, his occupation
has been confined to a set place in the
life of the worker, just as
industry has been confined to a set place in the structure of society.
We shall return to this problem presently. With respect to the sanc-
tions available to employers to enforce conformity with the values
of the ruling class of industry, we can note an analogous development.
The quasi-governmental police supervision of early
capitalists has
been restricted considerably in post-capitalist society. The ruling class
of industry rules over a rather more limited part of the lives of its
workers J
its sanctions are confined to properly industrial penalties
and are, even here, subject to legal regulations.
Employers shoot-
ing their workers with their own police force are as hard to imagine
today as corporal punishment, arrest, or even dismissal without rea-
son and reduction of wages.
^"^ The loss on the part of management
of quasi-governmental rights of control which penetrate deeply into
the life of the individual also marks a reduction of the formerly all-
embracing significance of industry.
Here, too, confinement to a spe-
cific, limited sphere can be demonstrated.
That industry and
industrial
conflict have been
institutionally
isolated means that they have settled down in society, have found a
stable and
definite place within
it.
Parallels to other
institutional
spheres suggest themselves. One might argue, for example, that in
the secularized societies of today the church has been displaced from
the all-embracing part
it played at earlier times and confined to a
proper, defined sphere in society; the church, too, has been institu-
tionally isolated.
In
all countries directly or indirectly affected by
the French Revolution, the relation of church and state is one of de-
limitation of competence between two separate
institutional orders
and imperatively coordinated
associations.
According
to the
thesis
here advanced, we are witnessing, in post-capitalist society, a similar
development with respect to industry and the enterprises of industrial
production.
Here, too, a process of confinement—that
is, of delimi-
tation of basically separate competences—takes place. With a some-
what daring but illustrative comparison from modern medicine, one
might say that, like a stomach the ulcers of which are deprived of
their influence on the total organism by the severance of vagus and
sympathicus and which is left to regulate itself, industry in post-capi-
^* This— it has to be emphasized—holds for post-capitalist societies.
It emphati-
cally does not hold
for industrializing countries, Communist or otherwise, where
all
the worst symptoms of European capitalism reappear.

talist society has lost
its all-embracing social significance and has to
a certain extent been capsuled off from society.
I shall not try here to trace in detail the historical genesis of the
tendency described by these metaphors and comments. A number of
trends could be indicated which have contributed to this development.
T. H. Marshall sees one of the consequences of trade unionism
in
the creation of "a secondary system of industrial citizenship parallel
with and supplementary to the system of political citizenship" (57,
p. 44).
If
it
is correct to speak of an "economic citizenship" side by
side with the "political citizenship" (a phrase which trade unionists
like to use), then this very distinction hints at the separation of the
two spheres of industry and society.
Industry appears as a society
within society, a structural unit sui generis^ which in a way is complete
in itself without transcending its limits and without overlapping other
structural units and associations. By way of illustration, we may also
adduce here the much-discussed fact that the proportion of the pop-
ulations of post-capitalist societies occupied in industrial production
has not only failed to increase in the last decades but has, on the con-
trary, decreased. The extension of "tertiary industries" plays a part-
here.
Even in the economy, industry
is no longer that dynamic in-
stitutional sphere which draws ever new groups into
its whirlpool j
here, too, a certain delimitation and stabilization can be demonstrated.
The same tendency can, finally, be shown—if Sternberg's data and
conclusions are correct—even for the volume of industrial produc-
tion, that is, insofar as one can speak in Europe since the First World
War and in the United States since the Great Crash, of a "halt in
capitalist expansion" (see 186, pp. 177
ff.).
The theory of the institutional isolation of industry in post-capi-
talist society, if formulated on as general a level as we have so far
done, gives rise to a number of obvious objections. We shall mention
only a few.
First,
it would seem that the life of people in modern
societies is increasingly rationalized, mechanized, in this sense "indus-
trialized."
The products of industry dominate consumption
in
all
social strata and mold the standard and style of living of all.
Second-
ly, industrial and political problems are more closely connected than
ever.
If industrial production
is stopped
(e.g., by a strike) every
member of society feels the consequences.
In this sense, industry
is
by no means isolated. Thirdly, we can observe an increase rather than
a decrease of government influence on industry. From this point of
view, industry and society are also more closely connected than ever.
Finally, there
is even now a wealth of evidence of the existence of

----- Page 289 (native) -----
classes in Post-Capitalist Society (I)
271
interrelations, often of a personal kind, between the ruling classes
of industry and society. The composition of recent or current gov-
ernments in the United States, Britain, France, Germany, and other
countries would seem to sustain the thesis of C. W. Mills that the
"power
elite" of
post-capitalist
societies
is relatively uniform and
dominated by the carriers of industrial authority.
It
is not my in-
tention to ridicule or underestimate objections of this kind. The least
they prove is that the institutional isolation of industry is but a tend-
ency and not a completed development.
Yet, I believe that its ten-
dential reality can be demonstrated despite all objections.
In trying
to present this demonstration, however, we shall do well to leave the
investigation of the wider
thesis of the
isolation of industry
to
a
separate study and confine ourselves to the more limited issue of the
institutional isolation of industrial
conflict.
The thesis that, with industry, industrial conflict has been insti-
tutionally
isolated
in
post-capitalist
society can be rendered more
precise in a number of specific propositions,
(i) We assert, in the
first place, that position
in the authority structure of industry and
position in the authority structure of society are no longer necessarily
identical, and that the industrial position of a man does not prejudice
his political position.
(2)
It follows from
this that neither latent
nor manifest class interests of industrial conflict must be identical with
the latent and manifest interests of the same people in political con-
flict.
Industrial
interests have reference to the sphere of industry
onlyj they aim, above
all, at the maintenance or change of the in-
dustrial status quo, not the inclusive social status quo.
(3)
It follows,
further, that the dominant and subjected classes of industry need no
longer be part of the corresponding political classes. The theory of
classes permits the conclusion that there are as many discrete domi-
nant and subjected classes in a society as there are associations. Here
we assert that in post-capitalist society the rulers and the ruled of
industry and society are tendentially discrete groups.
(4) This means
that membership in an industrial class leaves open to which political
class an individual belongs, since independent determinants and mech-
anisms of allocation are effective in the associations of industry and
political society.
Before we try to explore some of the empirical consequences of
the theory described by these propositions, one more general remark
may be in place. One of the astonishing and annoying characteristics
of recent sociological theories of class conflict
is that they frequently
arrive at diametrically opposed conclusions. Whereas Burnham speaks

----- Page 290 (native) -----
272
classes in Post-Cafitalist Society (I)
of an undiminished, even
intensified, presence of the
class
conflict
between employers
(as managers) and workers, Schelsky believes
that the question of the significance of the "old" classes for the present
has to be answered "unequivocally in the negative." These incom-
patible conclusions cannot be argued away by ridiculing one or the
other student of the matter.
Rather, the incompatibility of these
theories challenges the sociologist to develop a new and better theory.
This
is precisely what the theory of the institutional isolation of in-
dustrial conflict affords.
It supports, so to speak, Burnham with respect
to the sphere of industry where the old conflict persists (although not,
as we have seen, in an intensified form), and it confirms, at the same
time, Schelsky's notion by disputing the binding force of industrial
conflict for the inclusive society.
In this way, the claim for general
validity implicit in both theories is rejected. The "old" conflict per-
sists j but its effects are limited to the institutional sphere of industry.
Outside industry, in the political society, the prolongation of "capi-
tal" and "wage labor" into "bourgeoisie" and "proletariat"
in the
Marxian sense no longer describes the dominant patterns of social
conflict.
EMPIRICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE THEORY OF INSTITUTIONAL
ISOLATION OF INDUSTRIAL CONFLICT
As formulated so far, the theory of institutional isolation of in-
dustrial conflict is a general orientation, a point of view rather than
a scientific theory. Above all,
it
is not, as such, susceptible of refuta-
tion by empirical
test.
One may argue for or against
it—but such
arguments can
finally neither confirm nor reject
its validity.
The
theory proves testable only if we succeed in deriving certain testable
propositions from
it, and in confronting them with known or accessi-
ble facts. Some of the assumptions which may thus be derived from
the theory of institutional isolation of industrial conflict, and which
promise to further the process of our analysis, will now be formulated
and, insofar as possible, at least illustrated by empirical data.
(i) If it
is correct that with industry itself industrial conflict has
been institutionally isolated in post-capitalist societies,
it follows that
his occupational role has lost
its comprehensive molding force for
the social personality of the industrial worker, and that
it determines
only a limited sector of his social behavior.
Even today, occupation
is generally assumed to be the decisive social role of at least the man
in industrial society. "A man's job—occupying nearly one-third of
his daily life—is more than just a means of livelihood or an outlet

----- Page 291 (native) -----
classes in Post-Capitalist Society (I)
273
for his creative energy j
it
is a vital influence on his existence even
beyond working hours.
His
social
position,
his economic welfare,
and even his daily habits are all determined by the kind of job he
holds" (120, p. 41 1). While there can be no doubt that income and
prestige are in all industrial societies to a definable extent functions of
occupation, and that many daily habits, such as the time of rising and
going to bed, are determined by the requirements of the job, the
thesis is advanced here that in the special case of industrial workers"
that sector of social behavior which
is not immediately determined
by occupation
is extending
steadily.
In
post-capitalist
society, the
worker, when he passes the factory gate, increasingly leaves his occu-
pational role behind him with the machines and
his work clothes j
outside, he plays new roles defined by factors other than his occupa-
tion. The occupation and the expectations connected with it dominate
less and less the life of the industrial worker, and other expectations
mold his social personality. The job has become exactly what
it
is
denied in the above quotation: a means for the end of life which as
such assumes a fixed and limited place in the workers' behavior.
Here, the "convergence of social science in highly industrialized
countries" emphasized by Schelsky has its place j
it aims at "putting
the structures of consumption and leisure-time behavior into the cen-
ter of the interpretation of contemporary society" (72, p. 65)- One
may (and must) doubt whether consumption roles are becoming
as Schelsky thinks (72, pp. 6$ ff.)—"the central determinant of all
patterns of behavior instead of class status,"
I should think that the
undoubted trend toward increasing the importance of his consumer's
position in the life of the worker in post-capitalist society develops
at the expense of occupational position and
testifies to the isolation
of occupationally determined patterns of behavior, i.e., their restraint
to a specific context confined in time and space.
If
it
is possible to
show, by empirical investigation, that consumption status does indeed
assume a more prominent place in the consciousness and factual be-
havior of the worker than
his occupational
status,
the
proposition
formulated here may be regarded as confirmed.
(2) A special case of the matter formulated in this proposition
and a further consequence of the theory of the institutional isolation
of industrial conflict can be found in the hypothesis that the partici-
pants of industry, upon leaving the factory gate, leave behind them
^'^ Probably this thesis
is also valid for other occupational groups; however, jn the
present context
1 want to restrict
it to industrial workers.

----- Page 292 (native) -----
274
Classes in Post-CafitaUst Society (I)
with their occupational role their industrial class interests also. The
manifest contents of industrial class interests are no longer identical
with those of political class interests.
At a time when the one and
only manifest interest of those subjected to industrial authority was
an economic subsistence minimum, defined either physiologically or
socially, this interest accompanied the workers to all spheres of their
social behavior. But the significance for class conflict of the tendency
toward equality, toward leveling the differences between strata, lies
in the fact that the increasing equalization of living conditions and
the institutionalization of the right to a minimum wage have provided
a basis for separating the manifest interests of industrial and political
conflict. Two aspects of this tendency are clearly visible today.
First,
the issues of industrial conflict in post-capitalist society are typically
no longer of the kind that would divide the whole society into "two
large hostile camps." They divide only the participants of industry
into two hostile camps j they are confined to goals in which only these
are "interested" by virtue of their occupational and, more specifically,
authority roles. This is true not only of wage claims based on higher
productivity, but also for demands to prolong paid vacations, shorten
working hours, establish participation in management—to say nothing
of the more technical issues of conflict (job evaluation, problems of
time and motion study, of wage system, etc.) which, outside industry,
are hardly understood as conflict issues.
In terms of its issues, indus-
trial conflict increasingly becomes industrial conflict without reference
to general
social and
political problems.
Secondly,
this narrowing
down of the issues of industrial
conflict means that the individual
worker
is concerned with them only in his role as worker.
In other
roles he
is moved by other things j
as consumer or citizen, he
is no
longer worker.
If, for the sake of clarity, an overstatement
is per-
mitted, one might say: as the bowling fan may get heated over cer-
tain problems in his bowling club which leave his behavior outside
the bowling club totally unaffected, so the issues of industrial conflict
become increasingly irrelevant outside the sphere of industry.^®
(3) One of the consequences of this fact and of the theory of
institutional
isolation
is that
industrial
strikes no longer
affect the
so-called public of post-capitalist societies immediately; indeed, that
strikes in one branch of industry leave workers in another branch rela-
^^ Tendential assumptions always require qualification;
this one
is no exception.
Obviously, matters of wage disputes affect the economic position of people;
this
in
turn affects consumption chances and thereby the
total social
life.
In historical per-
spective, a separation of spheres seems apparent, however, even here.

----- Page 293 (native) -----
Classes in Post-Cafitalist Society (I)
275
tively unaffected.
If industry and society are two discrete social con-
texts, conflicts in one do not lead to conflicts in the other, i.e., the public
does not identify itself with the striking parties on the basis of the
respective class situation, but for completely different motives
(e.g.,
harm to the economy, to one^s own position, temporary discomforts,
etc.).
Geiger's "new line" of a conflict between those who participate
immediately in production and the "mere consumers" plays a part
here: events within the
institutionally
isolated sphere of industry
may be regarded as threatening by the unconcerned public precisely
because of this isolation; they are not identified with political con-
flicts.
It
is a telling fact that in a German opinion survey in 1954
almost one-half of those interviewed took a stand against strikes and
expressed their belief that "the workers get, by strikes, advantages
only for themselves and never even consider the
interests of the
general public" (see 229, p. 235).^^
(4) Within the sphere of political organization
it follows from
the theory of the institutional isolation of industrial conflict that trade
unions and progressive
(socialist, labor) parties are no longer iden-
tical ; that, indeed, the notion of a workers' party has lost its political
meaning.
If
it
is true that
industrial
conflict
is,
in
post-capitalist
society, confined to
its own
specific sphere,
if, therefore,
the
role
distribution and the issues of industrial
conflict have lost their em-
bracing social significance, then the interest groups of industry and
society are also discrete organizations. They may
still be connected
by the bond of tradition, but they are no longer united by a common
cause and field of recruitment. The validity of
this thesis
is most
evident in the United States and least evident in Britain.
In all post-
capitalist societies, however, there is the double tendency to establish
the political independence of trade unions as interest groups in in-
dustrial conflict and to extend socialist or progressive parties as interest
groups in political conflict beyond the boundaries of an industrial class
to "people's parties" or "mass parties." Many people are
still sur-
prised to find active unionists among the voters, or even functionaries,
of conservative parties j but this is merely a consequence of the trend
of development which we have tried to describe as one of institutional
isolation.
(5) If this theory proves a useful explanatory tool,
it follows
to formulate a last derivation—that in post-capitalist society the ruling
'^ It has to be noted, however, that this latter attitude
is probably more character-
istic for Germany (where conflict
is notoriously regarded as "bad" and undesirable)
than for Britain and the United States.

----- Page 294 (native) -----
276
Classes in Post-Capkalisi Society (I)
and the subjected classes of industry and of the political society are
no longer identical j that there are, in other words, in principle two
independent conflict fronts.
Outside the enterprise, the manager may
be a mere citizen, the worker a member of parliament; their industrial
class position no longer determines their authority position
in the
political society.
According to this assumption
it is by no means true
that "the relation to the instruments of production
.
.
.
decides the
issue of class dominance, of power and privilege, in society" (Burn-
ham, 140, p. 97)
; political authority is, rather, allocated independent
of a man's industrial authority position.
Moreover,
this holds
in-
creasingly as within industry the separation of ownership and con-
trol increases and as the more universal
capitalists are replaced by
managers.
It was the intention of this analysis to push the theory of institu-
tional
isolation of industrial
conflict
to the point
at which
testable
hypotheses can be formulated.
Since no quantity of empirical data,
however large,
is capable of verifying these hypotheses,
it seems
sensible
to present them for
criticism and, perhaps, refutation by
empirical research. As long as they are not refuted, we may maintain
that in post-capitalist society the associations of industry and society
have to be understood as discrete universes of class conflict. "Wage
labor" and "capital," the industrial classes of capitalist society, de-
termine the social conflicts of industry even today as labor and man-
agement, or trade unions and employers' associations, although the
forms of these conflicts have been subject to many a change in the last
hundred years. The fronts of social conflict, however, can no longer
be extrapolated by merely extending the lines of industrial
conflict
beyond the boundaries of industry.
Neither
is "capital" extended
into the "bourgeoisie," the ruling class, nor "wage labor" extended
into the "proletariat," the subjected class, of post-capitalist society in
its political aspect. Rather, this is a problem for separate investigation.
INDUSTRIAL CONFLICT: TRENDS AND COUNTERTRENDS
The history of industrial conflict provides illustrations and exam-
ples for most of the patterns and types suggested by the theory of
group conflict in imperatively coordinated associations.
These illus-
trations and examples are all the more interesting, since the protago-
nists of
industrial
conflict have
in many ways remained
the same
throughout industrial development. We have seen that both capital
and labor underwent a process of decomposition in the course of the
last hundred years. The unified capitalist class of the time of Marx

----- Page 295 (native) -----
Classes in Post-Capitalist Society (I)
277
dissolved
into
various
elements, such
as
the managers,
the mere
owners, the finance capitalists j the homogeneous working class of a
hundred years ago evolved within itself new lines of differentiation
according to skill, income, prestige j both classes were extended and
complicated by the emergence of a "new middle stratum" of bureau-
crats and white-collar workers.
However,
all
these developments
have modified the authority structure of the industrial enterprise but
slightly.
There
still
are employers and employees, entrepreneurs
and workers J and management and labor are even today the quasi-
groups underlying the organizations that carry on the dynamics of
the social development of industry.
But the modes of their interrelations have changed in many ways
since the time the Luddites
in England fought their alienation by
trying to break machines in isolated factories, or even since the time
when a hired police force of management tried to disperse workers
on strike by force.
For one thing, the violence of industrial conflict
has diminished considerably.
This
is due, in the
first place, to the
very fact of organization of the conflicting parties.
Secondly, trade
unions and employers' associations have established an often intricate
system of routines of conflict regulation.
Before they have recourse
to violent manifestations of conflict, they meet to discuss their claims,
they call in a mediator and, perhaps, an arbitrator} in short, they try
to settle their disagreements by talking rather than fighting.
This
reduction of violence has been greatly helped by improvements
in
the standard of living of the workers.
In most of the countries that
might today be described as post-capitalist societies, absolute depri-
vation on the part of industrial labor gave way, early in this century,
to relative deprivation, so that the "cost" of victory or defeat in con-
flict decreased.
There
is a peculiar dialectics in the fact that this re-
duction of violence
is both cause and effect of the institutionalization
of industrial conflict: by forming organizations and defending their
claims, management and labor have been able to introduce changes
which in turn helped their chances of peacefully settling disputes.
With the violence, although for different reasons, the intensity
of industrial
conflict has decreased
also.
Here, the dissociation of
patterns that were superimposed in capitalist society is crucial. Above
all, in contemporary societies industrial conflict and political conflict
are no longer identical. The protagonists, issues, and patterns of in-
dustrial conflict make for a discrete set of social relations.
Industrial

countries, this dissociation of formerly superimposed patterns has also
occurred with respect to the relations between class conflict and other
types of conflict,^" and with respect to the relations between authority
position and social
status.
Characteristically, the
social status of a
skilled man devoid of authority
is higher than that of a low-level
bureaucrat who participates,
if in a distant way, in the exercise of
managerial authority. We have not here analyzed the incidence of
social mobility between the classes in industry. However, what little
data we have^^ suggest strongly that there is a great deal of exchange
between the classes in industry, between, as well as within, genera-
tions.
Industry
is, of course, by no means "classless," but there
is
enough mobility to suggest that from this point of view,
too, the
intensity of conflict has diminished rather than increased. The con-
clusion that the energies invested in industrial conflict by manage-
ment and labor
in post-capitalist society are rather smaller than a
hundred years ago
is confirmed, moreover, by numerous surveys
showing a steadily decreasing interest and participation in union affairs
on the part of labor.
Diminishing intensity and violence of conflict have their effect on
the modes of structure change in industry. They would suggest that
sudden as well as radical changes are largely absent on the contempo-
rary scene. Changes of conditions and structures occur gradually and
remain piecemeal.
In part, they take the form of penetration of the
ruling groups by members of the subjected groups, but more often
what happens in industry is that interests of labor are (if grudgingly)
accepted by management and made part of the existing structure.
In the foregoing analysis,
I have confined myself to indicating
such developments as point in the direction of decreasing intensity
and violence. As always in social affairs, however, development is by
no means unilinear. There are undoubtedly countertrends, also, and
our analysis is not intended to suggest that all trouble in industry
is
past.
For one thing,
it
is never possible simply to extrapolate social
developments. The fact that industrial conflict has become less vio-
^^ This
is still not entirely true in Britain with respect to the position of the Irish
in industry, and above
all in the United States with respect to
botli colored workers
and immigrant worlcers.
In
these cases the management-labor conflict
is even today
often intensified by other lines of division.
'^ Cf., above all, the data presented by G. Thomas for Britain (123, p. 30), ac-
cording to which only 5 per cent of the "managerial" category in his representative na-
tional sample have been managers all their lives, whereas no less than two-thirds of all
managers have been in manual laboring occupations at some time.

lent and intense in the last century does not justify the inference that
it will continue to do so. On the contrary, experience shows that in
the history of specific conflicts more and less violent, more and less
intense periods follow each other in unpredictable rhythms.
It is cer-
tainly conceivable that the future has more intense and violent con-
flicts in store.
To some extent there are already indications of such a develop-
ment.
I have tried to show that not all changes introduced in order
to regulate industrial conflict have been well-conceived. The German
shop council and co-determination systems block rather than open
channels of expression of conflicting interests.
It would not be sur-
prising if these ineffective modes of regulation should lead to new
and at first uncontrolled outbrealcs of violence} indeed, it would, from
the point of view of conflict theory, be surprising if this did not hap-
pen.
Moreover, the institutionalization of trade unions brings with
it that phenomenon which Michels (see 200)
so aptly described as
the "iron law of oligarchy,"
i.e., the stabilization of an unequal au-
thority distribution within the unions.
This, again, promotes a new
type of conflict, intra-union conflict, and one for which wildcat strikes
already provide some evidence.
It
is hard to see how trade unions
propose to check this development.
Finally, there is always, of course,
the possibility that totalitarian forms of government will interfere
with the industrial order and change its patterns of conflict.
It will
be evident to the reader that most of the analysis of the present chap-
ter presupposes a democratic political system.
Once this system
is
abolished, a new situation arises inside as well as outside industry—
system (as I shall try to show in the following chapter) that promotes
extremely intense and violent conflicts. Whatever trends toward re-
duction of violence and intensity of conflict there may be in the in-
dustry of post-capitalist society, there are countertrends also, and
it
is hard, if not impossible, to derive predictions in that sphere from
the analysis of this chapter.

II: Political Conflict
HOW PEOPLE SEE SOCIETY
Few people, sociologists or otherwise, deny that there
still are
conflicts in industry. Wage claims, demands for a share in manage-
ment, strikes, and lockouts are too clearly in evidence to be argued
away.
But there are many people who claim that so far as political
life in post-capitalist society is concerned, issues and lines of division
other than class have become far more important for an understand-
ing of society. Where this
is argued, half-truths are usually inter-
mingled with untruths.
It
is said that the problems of industry no
longer concern every citizen;
this
is true, but
it does not mean that
there are no longer issues that divide the political community.
It
is
said that political parties have become more and more similar in their
programs J
this
is true, but
it does not mean that they have become
interchangeable either from the point of view of the voter or from
that of policy.
It is said that people no longer respond to ideologies j
this is true, but
it does not mean that they have no divergent convic-
tions. At the bottom of such arguments there is often a vague asser-
tion to the effect that by comparison with their attitude during the
golden or gruesome age of capitalism, the people have changed their
attitudes, views, and outlook on
society.
It
is said that people no
longer look at society in terms of divisions and antagonisms but now
judge everybody on his merits from the point of view of a happy
cooperative whole; and that sociologists who insist on cleavages and
conflict merely again stir up troubles that have just been overcome.
This assertion, to be sure, is not a half-truth but an untruth.
Since it
refers to people's feelings, however, rather than to sociological
in-
terpretations of reality,
it
is both necessary and appropriate that we
begin our analysis of political conflict in contemporary societies with
a look at some studies that are explicitly concerned with ascertaining
how people see society.
Discussion of these studies will link the so-
ciological aspects of our problem with its psychological dimension and

----- Page 299 (native) -----
classes in Post-Ca-pitalist Society (II)
281
at the same time add some color and verisimilitude
to statements
which as assertions, assumptions, and hypotheses remain by necessity
vague, abstract, and, perhaps, unconvincing.
I have indicated earlier at which points the sociological analysis of
conflict may be fruitfully and legitimately supplemented by (social)
psychological data.
I have then emphasized what I again affirm here,
that psychological evidence does not and cannot provide a conclusive
test for our theory.
Primarily, our theory refers not to what people
think but to what they doj and while it may often be difficult to sepa-
rate the two, the validity of our theory
is in no way dependent on
whether a representative sample thinks
it
is valid.
The data
to be
discussed in this section illustrate some points of our theory, they are
suggestive of further problems, they help to round off the picture
of conflict in post-capitalist society presented here, but they must not
be understood as either confirming or refuting the theory of conflict
or any of its derivations.
Between the scientific explanation and the
popular view of a phenomenon there remains a gap which
is hard
to bridge.
With respect to the question of how people see society, we are
today in the fortunate position of having at our disposal a number of
competent studies which provide suggestive and comparable data for
various countries. Of these, I have singled out four that seem to me
of particular import: those of Centers
in the United
States
(38),
Popitz and associates in Germany (69), Willener in French Switzer-
land (76), andHoggart in Britain (52). Although these studies have
been conducted almost entirely independently of each other,^ their
authors formulate the object of their research in surprisingly similar
terms. Above all, there are two notions that come up in most of them,
namely, those of "class" and of "images of society" {images de
la
societSy Gesellschaftsbilder)
.
These studies are, in other words, di-
rectly to the point of our own investigation. Although similar in sub-
ject, these four studies differ in their techniques of investigation and
methods of interpretation.
Centers presents and
briefly interprets"
the quantified findings of a (multiple-choice) questionnaire survey.
^ Willener explicitly refers to Centers but not to Popitz and Hnggart.
All others
are apparently
(and, considering the dates of publication, understandably)
ignorant
of one another.
The
studies appeared
in
the
following sequence: Centers (1949),
Hoggart, Willener, Popitz
(all 1957). The co-authors of Popitz's study were H. P.
Bahrdt, E. A. Jüres, and H. Kesting; but since the parts in question here have been
written by Popitz alone,
it seems justified to refer to the study by his name.
^
I am neglecting, here, the sketchy and rather out-of-place theoretical introduc-
tion and conclusion of Centers' work.
Contrary to the author's belief, these have,
in
my opinion, virtually no relation to his data.

----- Page 300 (native) -----
282
Classes in Post-Cafitalist Society (II)
Willener used a questionnaire also, but an open-ended onej his more
varied findings are quantified and interpreted. The study of Popitz
and his team is based on depth interviews following a general schema j
in his interpretation, Popitz largely avoids quantitative conclusions
and instead presents a brilliant discussion.
Hoggart's study, finally,
is of a different kind altogether.
It is an outstanding "impressionistic"
account of what the author himself calls "aspects of working-class
life," based on intimate personal knowledge but evidently entirely
qualitative.
In all cases, we shall confine ourselves in the following
discussion to presenting in a summary fashion a small selection of the
findings and conclusions—those that are relevant for the progress
of our own investigation.
One of the
first conclusions reached by these studies
is that, by
and large, people do have an image of society.
In a sense, this is per-
haps not very surprising. The need to assess one's place in the world
is presumably an existential needj
it includes the necessity to place
oneself in the social universe of reference. At the same time, though
in general there exists an image of society, this does not come about
merely as a matter of course, nor is it easily or precisely defined for
the individual. However vague or stereotyped this image may be, it
requires some considerable effort of reflection and of dissociation from
one's most personal sphere. Let us look at how a man who lacks such
reflection views the world.
Popitz reports the case of a roll-caster
in a steelworks who, in his opinion, has no image of society: "(What
do you think of technical progress? )
I do not think that far.
I always
say, after us the deluge. (How does technical progress come about?
)
The foremen do that, and the engineers and employers.
.
.
. (What
does co-determination mean to you?)
Co-determination?
Has that
been carried out?
I have very
little interest
in that
.
.
."
(69, p.
227)
. This is certainly a pathetic statement; but should we not expect
to find
it often?
It would seem that in fact
it
is anything but com-
monplace to find that people have by and large a fairly articulate
view of the society in which they live.
A second uniform finding of the four studies in question
is that
people's images of society differ, and that such differences as there
are are not random.
Popitz and Willener each distinguish six types
of approach. Those of Willener are directly related to problems of
social stratification and class structure.
According to him, people see
society in terms of: {a) socioeconomic categories,
{b)
socio-occupa-
tional categories, (c) a dichotomy of dependence, {d) class struggle,

----- Page 301 (native) -----
Classes in Post-Capitalist Society (II)
283
{e) social prestige, or (/) political categories (see 76, p. 153). Popitz's
classification of types is more general. According to the dominant idea
in different images of society he distinguishes:
{a)
static order, (^)
progressive order,
{c) dichotomy as collective fate, {d) dichotomy
as individual conflict, ((?) reform of the social order, (/) class struggle
(see 69, p. 233).
In both studies, the (Marxist)
notion of society
torn by class strife was found to be of but minor importance: 10 per
cent of those interviewed by Willener and
i per cent (!) of those
interviewed by Popitz still adhered to this idea.^ The data presented
by Centers and Hoggart do not allow a comparison here.
Willener and Popitz agree, however, that their six types may be
further reduced to two basic images of society which underlie the
empirical variety found.
Here, Centers' work may be adduced also.
As we have done in this study. Centers distinguishes strictly between
social strata and social
classes, between a "static" and a "dynamic"
view of society (38, pp. 26 ff.). For Centers, as for us, this is a theo-
retical decision. However, the studies of Popitz and Willener show
that this decision is reproduced in the views different people have of
society.
"Strata (or levels)," states Willener, "imply the image of
a continuity
.
.
. whereas classes indicate antagonistic groups" (76,
p. 206), and he adds that, on the basis of his findings relating to this
distinction, "there can be no doubt that there are fundamental dif-
ferences between the image of individuals situated at the top of the
social scale and those situated at the bottom"
(p. 208).
More pre-
cisely: "The 'inferior* categories of respondents predominantly re-
spond in terms of social classes rather than strata j
conversely, the
respondents of 'superior' categories have a tendency of referring more
frequently to strata than to classes" (p. 206).
This conclusion bears
a striking similarity to that of Popitz when he expresses the notions
of "class" and "stratum" by the terms "dichotomy" and "hierarchy":
"All workers with whom we have spoken and who develop an image
of society in the sense of our definition at all see society as a dichotomy^
incontrovertible or subject
to change, unbridgeable
or
susceptible
of mediation by 'partnership.' ... By contrast, the white-collar man
knows a 'top' that is above him, and a 'bottom' that is below him. He
places himself in the middle, and develops a remarkably acute sense
^ The reason
for
this otherwise surprising difference between Switzerland and
Germany
is that whereas Popitz characterizes by the "class struggle" image only those
who profess strictly Marxist views, Willener also includes those who vaguely refer to
"capital," "exploitation," etc.

----- Page 302 (native) -----
284
classes in Post-Ca'pitalist Society (II)
of distinction and of social gradations. One may assume, therefore,
that he sees society not as a dichotomy like the industrial worker, but
as a hierarchy" (69, pp. 237, 242).
In these views, our two models of society reappear. The conti-
nuity of a hierarchical system of stratification represents order and
integration.
There may be problems and strains, but there are no
deep cleavages in society thus conceived. By contrast, the antagonisms
of a dichotomous structure of class evoke the ideas of conflict, dis-
sensus, and coercion.
But, in the empirical findings of Popitz and
Willener, these views are not complementary approaches to the same
object. To be sure, even here they are not contradictory.
But they
are held by different people.
Those "above" visualize society as a
comparatively ordered continuous hierarchy of positions; those "be-
low" are, above all, struck by the gap between them and "the others."
Several interpretations of this strange and important fact are possible.
In terms of our theory of conflict, however,
it would seem that the
dominant groups of society express their comparative
gratification
with existing conditions inter alia by visualizing and describing these
conditions as ordered and reasonable j subjected groups, on the other
hand, tend to emphasize the cleavages that in their opinion account
for the deprivations they feel. At least potentially, there is an ideo-
logical element in the models of society distinguished by us and, ap-
parently, by people generally. The integration model, the hierarchi-
cal image, lends itself as an ideology of satisfaction and conservation j
the coercion model, the dichotomous image, provides an expression
for dissatisfaction and the wish to change the status quo.
Even at a
time at which revolutionary ideologies of the Marxist type have lost
their grip on workers everywhere, there remains an image of society
which, in its political consequences, is incompatible with the more har-
monious image of those "above," whether they be called "capitalists,"
"ruling class," or even "middle class."
Little need be added about the hierarchical image of society as
expressed predominantly by middle-class people.
It
is, clearly, de-
rived from the notion of a bureaucratic hierarchy in which everybody
has his defined place both above and below others. The whole
is an
ordered, well-organized system
in which one can rise but not
fall,
and which has an accepted, institutionalized scale of symbols,
titles,
statuses.
Such conflicts as are recognized are individual, highly per-
sonal conflicts j and all other cleavages are banned from consciousness
as unpleasant also-realities.
As against this, even the more stereotyped versions of the dichot-

----- Page 303 (native) -----
classes in Post-Cafitalist Society (II)
285
omous image of society are rather more colorful. From the studies
under discussion
it would seem that there are,
in many languages,
simple but descriptive terms by which to characterize the two sides
of the dichotomy: them and us in Britain, ceux qui sont en haut and
en has in Switzerland (and, probably, in France), die da oben and
wir hier unten in Germany—these are expressions that belong to the
stock-in-trade of working-class language.
This is, for example, what
some of the workers interviewed by Popitz had to say about co-de-
termination:
" 'One can always corrupt the workers' representatives.
Where there
is money, there
is power. And if the workers' repre-
sentatives have really pushed through a decision, one can twist
its
execution in such a way that nothing comes of
it.
.
.
. They don't
want others to look at their cards. ...
If they ever go in for co-
determination, then to their own advantage: for the worker as much
co-responsibility and as little co-determination as possible.'
.
.
. 'We
have nothing to co-determine. That
is determined by management.
What they say, will be done—and that is that.'
.
.
.
'All that is just
talk. We have nothing to co-determine.
It's been managed by the
unions, and if anybody co-determines,
it
is at best the union secre-
taries and bosses.
.
.
. They up there don't care anyway' " (69, pp.
202 f.). Hoggart summarized the attitude apparent from these state-
ments in a splendid selection of stereotypes: " 'They' are 'the people
at the top,' 'the higher-ups,' the people who give you your dole, call
you up, tell you to go to war, fine you, made you split the family in
the 'thirties to avoid a reduction in the Means Test allowance, 'get yer
in the end,' 'aren't really to be trusted,' 'talk posh,' 'are all twisters
really,' 'never tell yer owt' (e.g., about a relative in hospital), 'clap
yer in clink,' 'will do y' down if they can,' 'summons yer,' 'are all in
a click [clique]
together,' 'treat y' like muck' " (52, p. 62).
The criteria of distinction between the two groups that make up
the dichotomy of society are varied.
Hoggart's list of idioms carries
a strong connotation of resentment of authority, so that differences
of power might indeed appear to mark the dividing line between
"them" and "us": " 'Them' is the world of the bosses, whether those
bosses are private individuals
or,
as
is increasingly the case today,
public officials"
(52, p. 62).
Willener emphasizes the criterion of
power also, but he adds others:
"Certain interviewees conceive essen-
tially two classes: the salaried and the nonsalaried,
in other words
those who are dependent and those who are independent. To this may
be added the formula 'those who work and those who do not work'
which
is given more rarely with the same meaning"
(76,
p.
155).

----- Page 304 (native) -----
286
Classes in Post-Ca-pitalist Society (II)
Popitz again stresses the importance of the "stereotype alternative
of power and impotency" (69, p. 244), but regards another criterion
as equally significant: the dichotomy between manual and nonmanual
labor. This dichotomy is, for Popitz, closely related to the "formula"
Willener encountered among his respondents
: "Even very intelligent
workers who make a point of judging white-collar people justly and
who concede that there have to be such people, too, remain mistrustful
in one respect: it seems extremely questionable to them whether white-
collar people really work" (69, p. 2385
cf. 68).
White-collar work
lacks "publicity,"
it
is not susceptible of the same kind of control as
manual work,- it
is not as visibly work; and a line
is drawn between
those who do "visible" and those who do "invisible" work.
In this
question of criteria for social dichotomies the study of Centers is also
relevant, for, although he did not intend to do so. Centers also found,
in effect, that for most people (American) society consists of but two
classes: the middle class and the working class.
Ninety-four per cent
of his original interview population assigned themselves to these two
classes.^
Among the
criteria
of
distinction between
these
classes,
Centers found "beliefs and attitudes," "family," and "money" most
prominent.
But, like Willener, Centers emphasizes: "To the mem-
bers of the working class the most important criterion of middle class
membership after money or income is the ownership of a small busi-
ness, profession or trade 5
in sum, being an independent operator or
proprietor of some kind" (38, p. 99). By contrast, "it cannot help
but strike one as highly significant that the most distinctive criterion
given for membership in [the working] class is 'working for a living' "
(38, p. 100).^ Not surprisingly. Centers, much like Popitz and Wil-
lener, concludes that "the effect is to make the white-collar work vs.
manual work and salaried work vs. wage work dichotomies both im-
portant bases for
class distinction
in virtue of their importance
as
criteria for working class affiliation, and the psychological effect is to
push white-collar workers toward identification with the middle class"
(38, p. 102).
* In
a later study Centers reports only 88 per cent did
so, while
there was a
slightly larger proportion of interviewees that "didn't know" or ranked themselves as
"upper"
or "lower
class,"
the
four
alternatives presented
to them
being "upper,"
"middle," "working," and "lower class"
(see 38, p. 77).
^ Even more striking, perhaps,
is the comparative evidence which seems to agree
even in the details of everyday language
: "working for a living and not working for a liv-
ing" (Centers, U.S.A.), "ceux qui travaillent et ceux qui ne travaillent pas" (Willener,
Switzerland), "wirklich arbeiten und nicht wirklich arbeiten" (Popitz, Germany).

----- Page 305 (native) -----
Classes in Post-Cafitalist Society (II)
287
However,
all four authors stress the
fact that these
criteria of
distinction do not permit of an entirely unequivocal identification of
all persons and occupations
as "middle class" or "working class,"
"above" or "below." The studies seem to agree that the dividing line
between "them" and "us" runs somewhere through
the group of
salaried employees. "The class position of office workers seems also*
to be an equivocal one, for they are claimed almost as often by work-
ing class people as they are by the middle class. The difficulty of
assigning them to class membership appears thus no less a one with
the members of actual classes than it has been to social scientists" (38,
pp. 81 f.).
Willener thinks that by the "below" most people mean
wage-earning as well as salaried employees (see 76, p. 163), but I
think more probable Popitz's and Hoggart's suggestion that in peo-
ple's minds the phenomenon of social distance
is crucial for distin-
guishing between "them" and "us."
According to Popitz, the fore-
men and immediate supervisors of industry, whose work
is visible
to most workers, are usually counted among the working class, and
"above" begins with the shop supervisors and the shop councilors
and union
secretaries,
for
these no longer "belong"
(see
69,
pp.
243 f.). According to Hoggart, for the worker the world of "them"
begins even
earlier:
"So, when working-class people are asked to
become foremen or N.C.O.'s they often hesitate.
Whatever their
motives, they will be regarded now as on the side of *them' " (52,
p. 64).
It will be well to remember, in the following analysis, that
for those who visualize society as dichotomous, the upper part of the
dichotomy begins not far from the bottom layer of social stratifica-
tion and includes
all those who have even a minimal share
in the
exercise of authority.
Whatever changes may have occurred in the last hundred years,
the idea that there is a fundamental division of society into "haves"
and "have-nots," "above" and "below," "them" and "us"
is
still a
force in the minds of many people. One might be tempted to think
that the dichotomous image of society is a relic of Marxism or, more
generally, of the conditions of early capitalism and their interpre-
tation.
However, Ossowski has shown that "the dichotomous view
of social stratification"—as an essay of his
is entitled (96)—is both
older and more general than capitalism. "The spatial metaphor which
represents society as an aggregate of men of which some are above
and others below belongs to
tITose images which do not lose their
•Centers had just discussed the position of farmers.

----- Page 306 (native) -----
288
Classes in Post-Cafitalist Society (II)
pertinence in the course of the centuries and which, as the history of
cultures seems to prove, impose themselves to the imagination" (96,
p. 16). Ossowski follows this image through the myths and religions
of mankind, through literature and philosophy. Three aspects of the
social dichotomy run like a thread through
its many manifestations:
the divisions into rulers and ruled;
rich and poor; those for whom
one works, and those who work (96, p. 19). We might feel inclined
to replace,
in the medieval English
quatrain, the word "God" by
"society" and thereby take the worst sting out of the dichotomy, but
its substance remains essentially true even today:
The rich man in his castle,
The poor man at his gate,
God made them high or lowly.
And ordered their estate.
The assertion that a dichotomous image of society is an archetype
of human understanding cannot, of course, be supported by the evi-
dence presented in this section.
Rather, there would seem cause for
qualifying the conclusions already drawn. We have seen earlier that
not everybody has an image of society at all; there are people who get
along with a minimum of reflection on matters beyond the immediate
horizon.^ Of those who have an image of society, only a few visualize
society as a dichotomous entity.
If one breaks down people's views
by their own occupational or class position, there are indications of
"deviance" from the point of view of class theory: workers rank them-
selves as "middle class," white-collar people profess a dichotomous
image of society. There are problematic groups, groups that are not
easily placed in terms of the dichotomy, such as salaried employees
and
farmers.
Finally,
the
consequences people draw from
their
images of society differ greatly.
Centers believes that "the top occu-
pational strata are marked by their adherence to the status quo in the
order of politico-economic relations.
In contrast, the lowest occupa-
tional groups are distinguished by their lack of support of the status
quo and by their endorsement of views clearly radical in character"
(38, p. 208).
Plausible as this sounds, it is as much a direct derivation
from Centers' theory as
it
is a summary of evidence.
Very likely,
^ Popitz found that about 20 per cent of those interviewed by him have no real
image of society (6g, p. 233)
; 24 per cent of those interviewed by Willener responded
negatively, without clear idea, or not at
all (76,
p. 161); by comparison, the
2 per
cent who "didn't know" or "didn't believe
in classes"
in Centers' study are surpris-
ingly few (38, p. 77).

----- Page 307 (native) -----
Classes in Post-Cafitalist Society (II)
289
Popitz
is closer to the truth
in concluding that the "consciousness"
of workers "may
still admit to
itself and to others that industrial
workers have their own interests which are in conflict with those of
others" (69, pp. 247 f.), but that there are also many phenomena,
both
social and personal, that make workers hesitant to draw pro-
nouncedly radical political conclusions from their dichotomous image
of society. This is confirmed by Glantz, who found in an independent
empirical study in the United States that "a latent tendency towards
radicalism undoubtedly exists among some workers, but there is little
or no historical evidence to indicate that it has recently been develop-
ing into a conscious ideology" (195, p. 378).®
Ossowski has shown
that the dichotomous image of society may be activated into an ideol-
ogy of political conflict, but
it is as such no more than an interpreta-
tion of the social world.
As a way of seeing society, however, the dichotomous view
is a
solid and, probably, powerful social fact.
It may lend itself toward
giving additional force
to the considerations offered
in
this study.
In a way, it provides a second foothold for our analysis of post-capi-
talist society: on the one hand, there are the suggestions and assump-
tions derived from the theory of conflict j on the other hand, there are
indications and problems furnished by the findings of systematic em-
pirical observation.
In any case, these findings dispose of the half-
truths and untruths mentioned at the outset of this section. That from
one point of view society presents a dichotomous image, an image of
conflict and dissensus,
is by no means an invention of
sociologists
imposed on a basically harmonious and cooperative social reality. The
dichotomies of post-capitalist society may have little to do with those
asserted by Marx: there is no disagreement here between sociological
and public opinion. But there still are dichotomies, and they are very
real to those who experience society in terms of them.
Here, as else-
where, sociological analysis is more than a disengaged and noncom-
mittal exercise of the mind:
it is an attempt to explain rationally and
systematically those facts which to men in society are real stumbling
blocks on their path.
THE AUTHORITY STRUCTURE OF THE POLITICAL STATE
"An imperatively coordinated association will be called political
association if and so far as the enforcement of its order is carried out

derived fiction" (195, p. 378 n.).

continually within a given territorial area by the application and threat
of physical force on the part of the administrative
staiff'^ (Weber,
33(3, p.
1 54)
. More precisely, Weber defines the state by its monopoly
of power within a given
territory.
Both these
definitions are not
altogether without their difficulties. At first sight it would seem that
the
state, conceived
as an imperatively coordinated
association,
is
inclusive of all other associations of society, since every citizen has
a place within
it.
In other words, whereas
industrial
enterprises,
churches, and armies are clearly delimited from each other and from
other associations by a definite personnel, the state is an aspect of the
total society which,
it might appear,
is impossible to isolate and to
contrast with associations "within
it."
However, this appearance
is
demonstrably deceptive.
It is inaccurate to say that all men in a given
territorial area belong to the state
: they do so only as incumbents of
one position and role, namely, that of citizen.
Strictly speaking, the
association of the political state is an organization of roles. The em-
pirical priority of its structure and dynamics cannot be derived from
an assumption that
it is, by definition or theory, more inclusive than
other such organizations. What some social scientists refer to as the
"polity" is a unit of social analysis strictly equivalent to an industrial
enterprise, a church, or an army.
For each of these associations we
may ask how its structure generates conflicts, how these conflicts are
patterned, and what changes result from them.
Thus the state, like the enterprise, has a structure of authority
relations.
There are in
it positions and persons endowed with the
right to issue authoritative commands (laws, decrees, etc.), and there
are other positions and persons subjected to them. The state "is an
association like others: churches, trade unions, and the rest.
It differs
from them in that membership is compulsory upon all who live within
its territorial ambit, and that it can, in the last resort, enforce its obli-
gations upon its subjects. But its moral character is no different from
that of any other association.
It exacts loyalty upon the same grim
condition that a man exacts loyalty from his friends" (197, p. 37).
The important point to emphasize here
is that in the state, as in in-
dustry, authority
is exercised by certain persons by virtue of their
positions. There has been a considerable amount of opinion in recent
years to the effect that in post-capitalist society political authority, as
it existed in most or all earlier forms of social organization, has been
"depersonalized" and
in that sense abolished.
In interpreting the
findings of Popitz reported above, Schelsky states: "But the substance
of this dualistic understanding of society begins to change markedly:

----- Page 309 (native) -----
classes in Post-Capitalist Society (II)
291
whereas *we^ means more and more clearly 'those who do the same
work with me here,' the opposite pole
is increasingly identified not
with capitalists or the bourgeois, but with the anonymous forces of
all kinds of large bureaucratic organization and its functionaries" (72,
pp. 67 f.). The fallacy implicit in this statement reminds one both
of Renner and of Riesman, who, each in his own way, also assert the
disappearance of traditional authority. As we have seen earlier, Ren-
ner believes that in post-capitalist society the rule of the few has been
replaced by the rule of "the law" or the "general will":
"This gen-
eral will defines the goal of society and of the economy, and all func-
tionaries pass from the service of masters to the service of the whole.
This general will
is the law." Of course, laws have to be executed,
but this
is a "matter of institutions which are organized exclusively
according to economic-technical standards" (71, p. 227).
In other
words, "objective"
forces have taken the place of ruling groups.
Riesman's conclusions are a little more cautious. But when he speaks
of the "thinning extremes of those who were once leaders and led"
(230,
p. 248), when he refers to the "amorphous distribution of
power"
in contemporary (American)
society, when he asserts that
"while it may take leadership to start things running, or to stop them,
very little leadership is needed once things are under way" (p. 252),
he
is not far from the theory that the personalized authority of a
ruling class
is a thing of the past.
"Power in America seems to me
situational and mercurial;
it
resists attempts to locate
it the way a
molecule, under the Heisenberg principle, resists attempts simulta-
neously to locate it and time its velocity" (p. 252). There is a trace
of Hegelianism in the conceptions of Schelsky, Renner, and Riesman,
and we shall have to reject them.
In the first place,
it
is not very prudent to render the analysis of
problems unnecessarily
difBcult by destroying the
tools which
are
necessary for
its successful accomplishment.
If we want to investi-
gate changes in the distribution and character of political authority,
we do well to hold on to this concept. "The modern state, for prac-
tical purposes, consists of a relatively small number of persons who
issue and execute orders which affect a large number in whom they
are themselves included" (197,
p. 295).
The important clause
in
this definition of Laski's
is that
it
is useful "for practical purposes."
Laski was well aware that "a view such as this has at least the supreme
merit of realism.
It admits that acts emanate from persons, and
it
insists that those persons are subject to the scrutiny of their fellow-
citizens" (p. 36).
Even in order merely to describe problems con-

----- Page 310 (native) -----
292
Classes in Post-Cafitalist Society (II)
nected with the authority structure of the state, we have to be able
to identify this structure as one of super- and subordination of per-
sons in their capacity as incumbents of social positions.
This approach seems realistic in a second sense, too. The state-
ment that the force of the law has replaced the authority of persons
provokes the question: Why was there this difference in other socie-
ties? The notions of "anonymous" ruling forces or of a society that
runs itself seem to document no more than that
it
is difficult, or that
Schelsky and Riesman find it difficult, to identify the seat of political
authority in post-capitalist societies.
But does this mean that there
is no authority? Does it mean that there are no persons who, by virtue
of their positions, are entitled and expected
to make authoritative
decisions?
It seems to me that a Hegelian reification of the state as
liberty incarnate is required in order to answer these questions in the
affirmative. Can there be any doubt that there still are governments,
parliaments, and courts of law in the contemporary world?
And
since this
is obviously an entirely rhetorical question—can there be
any doubt that cabinet ministers, members of parliament, and judges
lend their authority to decisions that affect the lives of those subjected
to them?
If there
is any truth in attempts to dispute the continued
presence of political authority in the contemporary world,
it is in the
empirical generalization that many people find
it hard to name and,
perhaps, identify those "above." But surely
it
is not the task of the
sociologist to hypostasize the confusions of public opinion into ambi-
guities of social structure itself.
However we may eventually describe and delimit the ruling class
of the polity of post-capitalist society, we maintain that the presence
of an unequal distribution of political authority over persons as in-
cumbents of positions
is both a useful assumption and a descriptive
fact.
Furthermore, most of the elements of the authority structure
of the polity are easily identified and clearly visible to anybody. There
is, in the first place, the large quasi-group of those who have no share
in the exercise of political authority. They may be described as the
"mere" citizens, i.e., those who occupy no political position other than
that common to all members of the polity."
It is a characteristic fea-
® Strictly speaking, citizenship
is of course dependent on more conditions than
mere residence in
a given territory.
Children, lunatics, criminals,
in some countries
women, new immigrants, and certain other groups do not enjoy citizenship
rights.
In modern democratic societies we can neglect these groups
in an analysis of political
conflict; in some earlier societies, however, such as classical Athens, the very possession
of citizenship rights involved political authority, and the dividing line between domi-
nance and subjection could be defined by possession or nonpossession of citizenship
rights.

----- Page 311 (native) -----
Classes in Post-Capitalist Society (II)
293
ture of political conflict in post-capitalist society that even the "bot-
tom" of its authority structure is not entirely deprived of rights. A
citizen
is not only eligible for political office, he has, above all, the
right to votcj and the act of voting may be described as an exercise
of control over others.
Legitimacy was, in
all societies, a necessary
requisite of the exercise of authority.
In modern democracies the pre-
sumption of legitimacy has been converted into a continuous process
of legitimation through regular elections and, in some cases, plebi-
scites.
It may therefore be argued that no citizen of a democratic state
is entirely powerless with respect to
its political
affairs.
However,
despite
this basic power common
to
all, a clear line can be drawn
between those who enjoy nothing but this minimum and those who
are in the position to exercise regularly control over the life chances
of others by issuing authoritative decisions. The citizens of a demo-
cratic state are not a suppressed class, but they are a subjected class,
or quasi-group, and as such they constitute the dynamic element in
political conflict."
By contrast to "mere"
citizens, members of the three
classical
branches of government have authority and, therefore, constitute the
quasi-group of those in domination." There
is,
first, the legislative
branch. De jure—if not de facto—it is, in most present-day advanced
societies, embodied in parliaments, chambers of deputies, houses of
representatives, and the like.
Deputies, representatives, members of
parliament belong, by virtue of their position, to the ruling quasi-
group of the polity.
Strictly speaking, however, this does not hold
for all members of parliament in a given situation: only those mem-
bers represent a more or less permanent part of the authority struc-
ture of the state who belong either to the majority party or to those
parties which make up a governing coalition.
Opposition members
also have some degree of authority by virtue of their parliamentary
position
J they may sanction decisions of the government
in power,
assent to, or even inaugurate legislation and thereby exercise authori-
tative control J but theirs
is an authority that might legitimately be
^° Laski,
in his definition of the
state quoted above, emphasizes that those who
execute orders are
themselves
affected by them.
This
important
clause
indicates
a
peculiarity of the constitutional
(as against the absolute)
state:
in
it, even the incum-
bents of positions of domination are at the same time citizens. They have authority
only in one of their (political)
roles; by this duplicity of roles they control themselves,
so to speak.
^^ This statement will presendy be qualified
in two respects:
first, by the
assess-
ment of the class position of political bureaucracies, and, second, by the discussion of
the phenomenon of representation, or the relation between power and interests in the
modern state.

----- Page 312 (native) -----
294
Classes in Post-Capitalist Society (II)
described as "situational." Members of the parliamentary opposition
exercise authority only if and when they are in agreement with the
majority or convince the majority to agree with them.
Otherwise,
they represent the interests of those excluded from domination. By
contrast to members of the parliamentary majority, they do not, by
virtue of their positions, permanently belong to the ruling quasi-
group of the polity.
Obviously, this subtle distinction
is blurred in
reality by relations of personal influence, complications of specific sit-
uations,^^ and, above all, by the implications of a representative system
in which group interests are regularly, and sometimes institutionally,
represented by nonparliamentary organizations. We
shall turn
to
these and other complications presently.
As far as the judiciary branch of government
is concerned, de-
limitation of "mere" citizens and carriers of authority presents least
difficulty, although here, too, a "situational" element of the exercise
of authority
is not absent.
In the
first place, the judiciary consists
of all positions and persons who are permanently in the service of
the state in order to enforce, and sometimes modify, the law: legal
advisers, judges on all levels, public prosecutors. To these are added
the two groups—solicitors and juries—whose authority is confined to
specific situations and who cannot therefore as such be included in
the ruling quasi-group of the polity. To refer to the judiciary as
part of the ruling class is of course a somewhat doubtful way to express
this idea.
I do not mean to imply a Marxian view of the legal system
as an incarnation of the ideology of the ruling
class.
Rather, the
position of the judiciary would seem to be somewhat similar to that
of the bureaucracy in that both are branches of government without
being the seat of particular interests except for a vague general orien-
tation to uphold the status quo.
In other words, the judiciary need
not be conceived of as a militant part of the dominant conflict group
of the polity, but
its members are in the position to exercise control
over others. They are therefore placed on the plus-side of the zero-
sum distribution of authority in the state.
Finally, the executive branch represents an integral part of the
dominant positions
in the
political
state.
Executive
positions
are,
above all, government positions.
Cabinet ministers and secretaries of
state constitute the visible expression of the chief executive, and by
^^ Such
as,
e.g., very small majorities dependent on the attendance of members,
or the independence of legislative and executive in the American sense which makes
a contradictory balance of power in the two branches possible.

Classes in Posi-Capitalist Society (II)
295
virtue of this fact they are rightly considered the real exponents of
political authority.
But the executive complex of the modern state
extends beyond the members of a cabinet.
It includes a large num-
ber of positions which might be described as those of white-collar
employees. And
it
is these positions that require our special atten-
tion in an analysis of political conflict in post-capitalist society.
BUREAUCRATIC ROLES AND POLITICAL AUTHORITY
Even in his definition of the
political
association, Max Weber
referred to the "administrative staff" as executor and instrument of
authority. An administrative staff can today be found in
all three
branches of government.
There are bureaucrats associated with the
legislative, with the judiciary, and with the executive, although their
number is probably greatest in the various branches of the executive.
Bureaucracies are moreover characteristic not only of the
political
system but also of all other institutional orders and associations of
post-capitalist society. We have already seen that the rapid growth
of an industrial bureaucracy introduced new elements into the pat-
terns of conflict
in industry.
The analysis of the
class position of
bureaucracies presented in this section applies, therefore, to the ad-
ministrative staff of all associations;
its immediate reference, how-
ever, is to the authority structure of the political state.
It is perhaps appropriate to recall at this point that in our survey
of historical developments in the last hundred years we have divided
the large group usually referred to as "white collar" or "new middle
class"
into two
distinct
parts.
One of
these,
that of white-collar
workers, clearly belongs to the subjected quasi-groups of imperatively
coordinated associations. There are of course white-collar workers in
the service of the state also.
In many countries, railway and post-office
employees, workers in public enterprises and municipal utilities, etc.,
have salaried or even civil service status. The following discussion,
however,
is concerned not with these occupations and persons whose
class position is unambiguous, but with bureaucrats of all levels,
i.e.,
with those salaried white-collar employees whose position places them
on a step of the ladder of administrative jobs. What
is their position
in political conflict?
Are they, as administrators of the means of in-
dustrial authority, a part or even the whole of the ruling class?
Or
are they, as dependent, often subordinate salaried employees, an ele-
ment of the subjected class?
There are few subjects which have been
dealt with
as thoroughly and extensively by sociologists as that of

----- Page 314 (native) -----

classes in Post-Cafitalist Society (II)
bureaucracy.
True, most investigations are not explicitly related to
the problem of class, but they are no less useful in our context for this
restriction. More than elsewhere in this study we can fall back, here,
on studies by other authors and claim empirical verisimilitude for our
conclusions.^^
Bureaucratic organizations
differ from
industrial
organizations
in one important point. Whereas the authority structure of industrial
organizations ifso facto defines the borderline that divides the two
aggregates of those in positions of dominance and those in positions
of subjection, and whereas industrial organizations are in this sense
dichotomous, bureaucratic organizations typically display continuous
gradations of competence and authority and are hierarchical. Within
dichotomous organizations class conflict is possible j within hierarchi-
cal organizations
it
is not.
This difference has an important conse-
quence for the definition of bureaucratic roles.
Insofar as bureau-
cratic roles are defined in the context of a career hierarchy, they do
not generate a (class) conflict of interests with other bureaucratic roles.
Tensions within bureaucratic role
structures
arise
characteristically
from frustrations of expected opportunities, from "blocked or *once-
for-alP mobility" (Tropp, 132, p. 322).
If, for example, there are
in a bureaucratic hierarchy several points of entry which divide the
total
career
into subsections separated by insurmountable
barriers,
these tensions may of course lead to social conflicts also,
i.e., to con-
flicts between groups.
However, one of the distinctive features of
bureaucratic role structures
is the principle of competition between
individuals, and the psychological strains and tensions resulting from
it (cf. Merton, 136).
Structural conflicts based on latent antagonisms
of interest in the sense of class theory are absent from bureaucratic
organizations by virtue of their hierarchical character.
This means
that all incumbents of bureaucratic roles in the association of political
society belong on the same side of the fence that divides the positions
of dominance from those of subjection.
Since a break such as gen-
erates class conflict cannot be demonstrated within bureaucratic struc-
tures,
it follows that bureaucracies stand in their entirety either on
the side of dominance or on that of subjection—no matter how dif-
ferentiated bureaucratic roles may be according to qualification, status,
and sphere of authority.
^^ The following discussion has been inspired largely by the works of Weber (33),
Bendix (126 and
138), Merton
(136), Lockwood
(135), Gouldner
(131), and
Croner (129), as well as by a number of further essays brought together in the reader
edited by Merton and others (136).

297
It
is hardly necessary to emphasize that
it would be nonsensical
to describe the roles of political bureaucracy in their entirety as roles
of subjection.
At least the highest civil servants are unequivocally
bearers of political authority; and what
is true for the highest civil
servants is also true—in accordance with the premise just introduced
—for all other employees of political administration.
Bureaucratic
roles are roles of political dominance.
Their definition includes cer-
tain latent interests which aim at the maintenance of existing insti-
tutions and valid values. The incumbents of bureaucratic roles are
members of one and the same ruling quasi-group. At this point the
analytical value of a rigidly formulated "theory of delegation" be-
comes apparent: the development which Weber described as one of
" 'socialization* of authority relations"
(33^', p. 669) has made for
a "division of labor" of the total process of the exercise of authority.
Like the division of labor in industrial production, this has led to the
creation of numerous specialist positions, every one of which bears
but slight traces of the process of which
it
is a part. Who produces
the car in an automobile factory?
The director?
The
fitter?
The
foreman?
The typist?
Every one of these questions has to be an-
swered in the negative, and one might therefore be tempted to con-
clude that nobody produces the car at all.
Yet the car
is being pro-
duced, and we can certainly identify people who do not participate
in its production. In relation to authority, both industrial and political,
we encounter a
strictly analogous
situation.
Nobody
in
particular
seems
to
exercise "the
authority," and
yet
authority
is
exercised,
and we can identify people who do not participate
in
its
exercise.
Thus
the
superficial
impression
of
subordination
in many minor
bureaucratic roles must not deceive
us.
All
bureaucratic roles
are
defined with reference to the total process of the exercise of authority
to which they contribute to whatever small extent.
Differentiation
of spheres of authority
(i.e., of how many people are controlled to
what extent) permits of manifold gradations j but the possession of
authority itself does not. The strange structural state emerging for
these reasons in post-capitalist society has been described by Weber
as a "leveling of the ruled vis-a-vis the ruling, bureaucratically dif-
ferentiated group" (33^, p. 667). While the "mere" citizens, those
excluded from
political
authority,
are
in
this
respect
a uniform
(quasi-)
group, the ruling class presents an image of far-reaching
hierarchical differentiation.
It is clear that this type of analysis of the class position of clerks
and bureaucrats confirms the subjective experience of people described

----- Page 316 (native) -----
298
Classes in Post-Capitalist Socieiy (II)
earlier in this chapter, where we have seen that for many "ordinary"
citizens and workers the world of "above" or "them" begins with the
white-collar employee.
" 'Being dressed up to go to work,' 'sitting
down to work,' 'having it cushy,' 'pushing pens,' 'being bosses' men,'
'being one of them up there* from whom orders come and authority
emanates,
are terms which working men
frequently
use of
office
workers,
irrespective
of
their
actual
positions
in
the
office
hier-
archy" (Lockwood, 135, p. 131). The fact that white-collar people
do
not
usually regard
themselves
as being "on
top"
or "upper
class," far from contradicting the attitude of those "below," adds a
further element which we have here discussed: the very nature of
bureaucratic organization makes everybody feel that although some
are "below" him, there are also others "above," so that he
is "in the
middle." Whatever the ruling class of post-capitalist society may be,
it seems probable that it will tend to deny its own rule on account of
its internal
differentiation, which places every one of
its members
between two others.
However, while this internal differentiation of
the ruling
class complicates the
situation, sociological
analysis and
people's "class consciousness" converge in the conclusion that "the
clerk is the man on the other side of the desk who is somehow asso-
ciated with authority" (Lockwood, 135, p. 132).
According to Weber's conception—which, more recently, has been
adopted and further elaborated by Bendix—bureaucracy has not only
a share but a monopoly of political authority. In support of this thesis,
both
sociologists
refer, above
all,
to the monopoly of
specialized
expert knowledge on the part of bureaucracies which makes their re-
placement (say, in a revolution) as impossible as their effective control
by others who invariably find themselves, "in face of the schooled
civil servant who stands in the process of administration, in the posi-
tion of the 'dilettante' vis-a-vis the 'expert' " (Weber, 33^, p. 671).
This monopoly position
is further strengthened by
the
attributes
characteristic of bureaucratic status, and by tenure^ pension rights, and
similar privileges.
It would be misleading to think of bureaucracies
as a ruling caste because of their monopoly of authority j a class be-
comes a caste only if entry to
it remains, for many generations, an
exclusive privilege of the children of its members.
This is decidedly
not the case in highly mobile advanced industrial societies.
Never-
theless, the monopoly of authority founded in expert knowledge pro-
vides the incumbents of bureaucratic roles at any given time with a
degree of exclusiveness which underlines their unity as members of

----- Page 317 (native) -----
classes in Post-Cafitalist Society (II)
299
the same quasi-group and may be conceived of as a condition of con-
scious solidarity.
Does all this mean that the incumbents of bureaucratic roles in
public administration are the ruling class of post-capitalist society?
The attempt to answer this question reveals in the class position of
bureaucracy a strange paradox which explains many otherwise
in-
comprehensible modes of behavior of the clerk, the administrator,
and the
civil
servant.
"The
fact that bureaucratic organization
is
technically the most advanced instrument of power in the hands of
those who control
it does not as yet say anything about how force-
fully the bureaucracy as such
is capable of pushing through
its con-
ceptions within the social organization in question" (Weber, 33^, p.
671).
Bendix states even more incisively: "The bureaucracy
is all-
powerful and at the same time unable to determine how
its power
should be used" (126,
p.
129).
In other words, the bureaucratic
monopoly of authority
is a mere potential, mere possibility of au-
thority without a structurally defined goal.
Weber and Bendix have tried to explain this fact. Both of them
argue that the indispensability of bureaucracies for the administration
of the modern state
(i.e., the very basis of their authority) has led to
the development of a professional ethos, the dominant values of which
are duty, service, and loyalty—in other words, values of subordina-
tion, not of autonomous domination.
Bendix emphasizes, moreover,
the significance of formal efficiency of administration for the defi-
nition of bureaucratic roles.
Bureaucracies are oriented toward the
smooth functioning of the machinery of administration irrespective
of which interests are administrated according to which substantive
principles.
For bureaucracies, what exists is what exists at any given
time;
as an interchangeable constant
it enters into the definition of
bureaucratic
roles.
The so-called "nonpolitical
civil service"
is an
expression of this attitude.
Its consequences, however, are manifold
and highly significant for conflict analysis.
First, by its monopoly of
authority unaccompanied by independent substantive
interests, the
bureaucracy of the state is, so to say, the law of inertia of social de-
velopment become real.
Bureaucracies persist as a constant force in
all changes of the personnel of leading political positions.
Following
Weber, Bendix has emphasized the impossibility, which has its cause
here, of revolutions
in bureaucratically governed
states.
Secondly,
the trend toward "purposive rationality" and "managerialism" which
is so characteristic for the ruling values in wide areas of post-capitalist

----- Page 318 (native) -----
300
Classes in Post-Cafitalist Society (II)
society
is embodied in bureaucracies and their formalism of orienta-
tion toward the "how," not the "what," of authority.
Thirdly, the
state administered by a bureaucracy functions almost without restric-
tion even if political governments change rapidly, for the indispensa-
bility of bureaucracies makes these into ever ready and ever available
regents or temporary plenipotentiaries of authority/*
Thus, a peculiar position must be assigned to bureaucracies in the
light of the theory of conflict.
Although they always belong to the
ruling class, because bureaucratic roles are roles of dominance, bu-
reaucracies as such never are the ruling class.
Their latent interests
aim at the maintenance of what exists j but what it is that exists is not
decided by bureaucracies, but given to them.
In two respects—and
it will prove useful to separate these two aspects—the incumbents of
bureaucratic roles are dependent on forces beyond them.
First, their
authority is borrowed or delegated authority which ultimately refers
back to certain roles, endowed with most general authority, outside
the
orbit of bureaucracy.
Although
all commands are channeled,
specified, perhaps adapted and even modified by bureaucracies, these
commands
originate
outside
their hierarchy.
Second, the
interests
which define the substance of their authority are also given to bu-
reaucracies.
These merely administer, by virtue of their delegated
authority, general orientations which are conceived and formulated
elsewhere and by others. Because of this double dependence, bureauc-
racy represents what might be called a political reserve army, a reserve
army of authority.
Domination without a bureaucracy
is no longer
possible, but domination merely by a bureaucracy is impossible, too.
As a medium and instrument of domination, bureaucracy stands at
the disposal of anybody who is called upon to control it. As a constant
in
political
conflict
it accompanies and supports whatever group
is
in power by administering
its interests and directives dutifully and
loyally.
It is, as Renner rightly says, a "service class," defined by its
service relation to authority.
In the preceding remarks I have deliberately overstated my case
a little.
In actual fact, bureaucracies are by no means as powerless as
our analysis might suggest.
In a difi^erent context,
it would be worth
exploring the conditions of refusal of service by bureaucracies as well
^* This
is what Riesman might have meant by his remark about the state that runs
itself (although he does not say so).
Even so, a note of caution
is in order.
For some
time,
a state may be effectively ruled by a bureaucracy without a head; but soon the
Impossibility of innovation will make
for intense and violent conflict.
This problem

as the structural consequences of the immanent conservatism of in-
cumbents of bureaucratic roles. With respect to both these questions,
Bendix has provided an approach in terms of the conditions and limits
of bureaucratic autonomy
(cf.
126, pp.
131
ff.). Many an insight
into the regularities of social change in modern societies might be
gained by further investigating these problems.
Here, however, one final aspect of bureaucratic roles seems more
important.
Being incumbents of roles of dominance, the civil serv-
ants of public administration always belong to the ruling political
quasi-group.
However, being a reserve army of authority, the bu-
reaucratic members of this quasi-group are not potential members of
an interest group of those in power. For structural reasons, the process
of class formation
is always abortive
in the
case of bureaucracies.
Their members are, by virtue of their positions, united by certain
(formal)
latent
interests.
Their
(substantive)
manifest
interests,
however, are, again by virtue of their position, always derived from
those of the group that represents the existing state of affairs and that
controls bureaucracy.
In principle, these manifest interests are there-
fore interchangeable 5 they change with changing ruling groups.
In
this sense, too, bureaucracies are merely a potential j they are,
in a
paradox, a class which can never be a class, a quasi-group whose path
to organization is blocked by the social definition of the roles of its
members.
This does not mean, of course, that civil servants cannot
have political convictions and become members of political parties.
But
it does mean that, as
civil servants—as incumbents of roles of
dominance, that is—they cannot consistently profess a definite set of
manifest interests. The bureaucratic reserve army of authority
is a
mercenary army of class conflict j
it is always in battle, but it is forced
to place its strength in the service of changing masters and goals.
THE RULING CLASS
Who, then, constitutes the ruling class of post-capitalist society?
The attentive reader will have noticed that we have given
at least
part of the answer already—although this simple-sounding answer
may not meet with his approval.
Obviously, we have to look for the
ruling class in those positions that constitute the head of bureaucratic
hierarchies, among those persons who are authorized to give directives
to the administrative staff.
This head of the hierarchy, however,
is
clearly defined:
it consists of precisely those positions in the three
branches of government which we have described above as the top
of the pyramid of authority in the polity. The clerk in a court of law.

----- Page 320 (native) -----
302
Classes in Post-Cafitalist Society (II)
the parliamentary private secretary, and the office director in a min-
istry have delegated authority; they are bureaucrats. But the Speaker
of Parliament, the Prime Minister, and the Supreme Court Judge
have immediate authority;
their decisions provide legitimation and
substance to the work of the administrative staff.
It
is true that, in
the constitutional state, judge, minister, and member of parliament
are each responsible to somebody, too. Each is, in Laski's words, "sub-
ject to the scrutiny of their fellow-citizens," either through repre-
sentatives or directly through public opinion.
But within the formal
hierarchies of
political authority they are the ones to whose
roles
attaches the expectation of authority, who make decisions binding upon
all.
In this sense, the leading positions of executive, legislative, and
judiciary are the obvious places in which to look for the core of the
ruling quasi-groups of the polity.
I have said that this
is obvious, and I should like to emphasize
this point.
It seems to me that one of the main shortcomings of
analyses such as those by Burnham and Mills (and of Marx, for that
matter, although there the mistake was less consequential)
is that
they do not pay enough attention to the evident seat of authority
in-
the political state, and to its occupants.
Managerial or capitalist elites
may be extremely powerful groups in society, they may even exert
partial control over governments and parliaments, but these very facts
underline the significance of governmental elites: whatever decisions
are made are made either by or through them ; whatever changes are
introduced or prevented, governmental
elites are
their immediate
object or agent; whatever conflicts occur in the political arena, the
heads of the three branches of government are the exponents of the
status quo.
It
is admittedly not sufficient to identify a ruling class
solely in terms of a governmental elite, but it is necessary to think of
this elite in the first place, and never to lose sight of
its paramount
position in the authority structure of the state.
In this sense, I should
agree with Riesman's point about the analysis of ruling classes in post-
capitalist society: "We cannot be satisfied with the answers given by
Marx, Mosca, Michels, Pareto, Weber, Veblen, or Burnham, though
we can learn from all of them" (230, p. 252).
Of course, this insistence on governmental elites as the core of
the ruling class must be truly shocking to anybody thinking in Marx-
ian terms, or, more generally, in terms of the traditional concept of
class. To some extent, the apparent incompatibility of the traditional
and of our notion of class will be bridged presently.
Basically, how-
ever,
it
is important to recall at this point that the present study
is

----- Page 321 (native) -----
Classes in Post-Capitalist Society (II)
303
concerned not with the concept of class and
its current applicability,
but with the problem of conflict in industrial society.
I believe that
the traditional concept of class may be incorporated as a special case
into the analysis suggested herej but the concept as such
is irrelevant
to our discussion.
If
it sounds strange that cabinet ministers, judges,
and members of parliament should be the exponents of a ruling class,
this strangeness is, in my opinion, due to the strangeness of reality,
and not to the faultiness of the approach proposed
in
this study.
Ruling classes, in many countries today, no longer behave as their
predecessors did in capitalist society j they are, for this reason, no less
ruling classes or, if one prefers these terms, dominant groups in po-
litical conflicts.
It is true, of course, that, much like bureaucracies, governmental
elites provide but an incomplete description of any ruling class or
dominant conflict group.
Bureaucracies are heteronomous j they are
therefore a reserve army of authority. Governments represent people
and interests 5 they are therefore the exponents and not the whole of
the ruling class. The phenomenon of representation, which compli-
cates so many problems of political analysis in contemporary society,
has two complementary aspects.
First, governmental
elites are the
exponents of certain persons, the visible head of a body of men who
through government have a share in authority.
Cabinet members,
judges, and members of parliament do not make up an autonomous
group that exists by itself 5 they rule on behalf of somebody.
Second,
the substance of government policy incorporates interests which origi-
nate outside the rather limited circle of governmental
elites.
The
exercise of authority always involves both the chance to issue authori-
tative commands and certain interests which constitute the substance
of these commands.
In order to identify those who are represented
by governmental elites, we have to find the sources of their substantive
policies as well as the group or groups behind them. In abstract, there-
fore, the ruling political class of post-capitalist society consists of the
administrative staff of the state, the governmental elites at its head,
and those interested parties which are represented by the govern-
mental elite.
This conclusion is obviously so abstract and formal as to be utterly
useless for our understanding of the societies in which we live
; and
I do not propose to leave it at that. However, this abstract conclusion
marks the limit beyond which a general analysis of post-capitalist
society cannot go.
All modern societies have bureaucracies and gov-
ernments j in this respect, our conclusion holds for the United States

----- Page 322 (native) -----
304
classes in Post-Cafitalist Society (II)
as for the Soviet Union, for West Germany as for East Germany.
But the "interested parties" behind the governments of these coun-
tries differ greatly.
Rather than describe their composition in gen-
eral, we must here
try
to determine the range of
variability of
possible structures.
"Post-capitalist society" in the singular dissolves
here into a variety of political systems. One of the most important
of those
criteria which define the range of variability of
political
conflict seems to me the homogeneity of the groups represented by
governments.
In terms of their homogeneity, we can construct a scale
of types of ruling classes which seems to cover the empirical patterns
found in the modern world.
At one extreme of this scale we find the situation envisaged by
Marx, Burnham, and others.
Here, the governmental elite
is part
and parcel of a homogeneous and organized larger entity.
Cabinet
ministers, judges, and members of parliament—if such
exist—are
chosen from among this larger group, and the substance of their de-
cisions is defined by the interests held by the larger group. Although
not part of the formal hierarchy of political administration, the mem-
bers of this group are incumbents of positions of political domination
on account of their continuous, if indirect, participation in the business
of government.
This
is roughly the situation described by Djilas as
characteristic of modern totalitarian states." A state party controls
the instruments and positions of government (including, in this case,
the administrative
staff).
In terms of personnel and interests, the
members of this party constitute the recruiting field of government.
They are the quasi-group which attempts to maintain the status quo
of authority relations, and their exponents at the top of the admin-
istrative hierarchies are interchangeable representatives of identical
interests.
At the other extreme of the scale that defines possible types of
ruling classes we encounter the condition so aptly described by Ries-
man.
Here, the governmental elite does not represent a stable, or-
ganized quasi-group. There are, to be sure, political parties, but these
are themselves heterogeneous to the extent of losing their identity.
Instead, society is split up into a large number of organizations, "veto
^^ It has to be realized, of course, that the extremes of the scale described here
are ideal types which we are unlikely to find in reality.
If we identify, therefore, the
two extremes with the analyses presented by Djilas (here) and Riesman (below), this
implies a critical appraisal: both Djilas and Riesman have—perhaps deliberately, and
in
that sense justifiably—overstated
their
cases by claiming
reality
for
ideal-typical
models.

----- Page 323 (native) -----

305
groups," which "by their very nature
.
.
.
exist as defense groups,
not as leadership groups" (230, p. 245), but which have situational
authority. Any one act of government reveals an "issue" which has
been advocated by somebody j veto groups enter the structure of au-
thority when and as long as an interest or person of their choosing
is adopted by government. This is a peculiar state of affairs, in which
it
is indeed virtually impossible to locate the ruling class.
Govern-
ment itself is here bureaucratizedj
its heads merely provide channels
of expression for varying aggregations of interests. The governing
elites represent nobody in particular, or everybody, except in specific
situations and
decisions
in which
they
associate with
specific veto
groups.
Rather than an exponent, they are but a switchboard of
political authority.
Thus the ruling class consists of two constants,
bureaucracy and government, and one variable, the veto group whose
claims are, in particular situations, incorporated in government policy.
Conversely, the subjected class consists of all those who in a given
situation do not associate with government, but again it is a situational
class, every element of which has its chance to exercise authority.^^
However, these extremes of the scale, and particularly the latter,
are ideal types, and emphatically do not describe the conditions of any
existing society. Within totalitarian state parties, there are invariably
competing subgroups representing
sectional
interests with varying
degrees of
success.
The "new
class," far from being an
entirely
homogeneous entity,
is a highly explosive unit
in which local and
central, industrial and agricultural, dogmatic and adaptive, bureau-
cratic and entrepreneurial "pressure groups" struggle for domination.
If the ruling class of present-day totalitarian societies nevertheless
comes close to the
first extreme of our scale, this
is largely because
experience shows that when the existing order itself
is threatened,
most of its subgroups abandon their differences in favor of the com-
mon goal to uphold the status quo.
With respect to Western societies, on the other hand, Riesman
overstated his case in several respects.
For one thing, political con-
flict in post-capitalist society has grown out of the fierce ideological
battles of the capitalist period, and it is at the very least unlikely that
these have entirely ceased to play a part.
For another thing, there
^® Riesman's exposition of this situation in the chapter on "Who Has the Power? "
(230, pp. 242-55)
is really excellent, and little need be added
to
it, except for two
things:
first, Riesman
underemphasizes
the
place and importance
of governmental
elites as switchboards of power j second, he describes an
ideal type and not an actual
situation.

----- Page 324 (native) -----

Classes in Post-Ca'pitalist Society (II)
still are political parties. While it is certainly true that these are less
and less inspired by all-embracing ideologies, there
still are differ-
ences between them.
Perhaps political parties, too, tend to become
switchboards rather than holders of authority, but they are switch-
boards with a bias.
Riesman believes that "unlike a party that may
be defeated at the polls, or a class that may be replaced by another
class, the veto groups are always *in* " (230, p. 254).
Undoubtedly,
lobbyists of every description try to keep up good relations with all
political
parties.
But for the parties, there
still are hierarchies of
interest, there is a rank order of veto groups. With respect to specific
issues, a party cannot simultaneously satisfy trade unions and em-
ployers' associations, veterans' organizations and pacifist groups, Prot-
estant and Catholic churches, competing minorities, etc. Even if the
manifest interests of political parties are reduced to an order of pre-
cedence for lobbyists, these still provide a general direction of policy
in matters both of personnel placement and of the substance of po-
litical decisions.
Thus, if the ruling class of post-capitalist countries in the West
is "situational," this
is not because
it consists of ever changing veto
groups, but because political parties "may be defeated at the polls.''
It has but one stable element, the bureaucracy of the state. While the
bureaucracy is an impotent participant of political conflict in the ordi-
nary course of affairs, its conservative effect on all modern societies,
and especially on those whose governments change rapidly, must not
be overlooked.^^ The governments of Western societies are often
mere switchboards of authority j decisions are made not by them but
through them.
In this respect, the political parties from which the
personnel of governmental
elites
is
recruited do
not
differ very
greatly from these elites.
But there
is, associated with every party,
a number of veto groups that enjoy the particular favor of this party.
If this party is in power, then the ruling class of the society in ques-
tion consists of the four elements: bureaucracy, governmental elite,
majority party, and its favored veto groups.
If
it
is not in power,
then
its favored veto groups are, like
its members, defense groups
that represent the interests of the subjected class.
^^ This
eflFect was particularly evident, of course,
in France before de Gaulle
assumed power—and
its consequences for political conflict are
still in evidence. Gen-
erally speaking, however, bureaucracies may promote stability, but stability and stag-
nation are never very
far apart; and where
social development
is arrested,
political
conflict
is likely to increase rapidly in both intensity and violence.

----- Page 325 (native) -----
classes in Post-Capitalist Society (II)
307
It might appear as if we were trying to avoid the question of who
is the ruling class in post-capitalist society.
Having first reduced
its
composition to some constant and some empirically variable elements,
we have now described these elements in a manner exactly as formal
as before. However, even on the reduced level of the generality of
the last part of our analysis, we can go no further. The ruling quasi-
groups of post-capitalist societies differ from country to country, and
from election to election, depending on the party (and veto groups)
in power.
Otherwise put, political conflict
is always situational con-
flict between those who at a given point of time are excluded from
authority and those who are "in."
It is a characteristic feature of most
Western societies that the "ins" and the "outs" change places, or can
at least change places.
If they do not do so for prolonged periods of
time, if, in other words, one party stays in power for several election
periods, it is likely that both the intensity and the violence of political
conflict will grow, because certain interests (and veto groups) are con-
tinuously and systematically neglected.
If there is a regular exchange
of personnel and policy,
conflict will remain situational and mild,
because all interests (and veto groups) are recognized.
In any case,
the
stable elements of the ruling
class of contemporary Western
societies are politically impotent, and the dynamic elements are em-
pirically variable.
POLITICAL DEMOCRACY
Many of the features characteristic of the political class structure
of Western societies are both a consequence and an index of a process
which, without undue extension of the term, might be described as
political democracy. More generally, our analysis of ruling classes
in post-capitalist societies reveals by implication different modes of
institutionalizing political conflict j and
it
is to these that
I propose
to turn in the concluding sections of this study. We have seen that,
empirically, conflict has two major aspects, those of violence and of
intensity.
These in turn determine the ways in which group conflict
leads to structure change. How do the factors influencing violence
and intensity of political conflict, and suddenness and radicalness of
structure change, present themselves in post-capitalist society? Which
future trends seem indicated in the patterns of conflict and change
of present-day industrial countries?
Once again—to start, in this section, with the violence aspect of
conflict—it will help our analysis
if we begin by constructing ideal

----- Page 326 (native) -----

Classes in Post-Cafitalist Society (II)
types In order then to confront real societies with them. There is, to
begin with, the democratic type of society.
In
it the conditions of
organization are present for most subjected groups. There is freedom
of coalition and free communication, and for most political groups
leaders and ideologies are readily available.
In fact, there are organi-
zations—political parties—representing the interests of the opposing
quasi-groups (with the qualifications introduced above).
Moreover,
absolute deprivation of any group of the population in terms of socio-
economic status has become rare, if not impossible.
Finally, there is
an elaborate system of conflict regulation in the political sphere.
In
fact, the institutions of the democratic state reflect very nearly the
model of effective conflict regulation: conflicting parties and interests
are institutionally recognized j parliamentary bodies furnish the set-
ting of regular conciliation between the parties j the rules of the game,
including a constitution as well as statutory procedural arrangements,
enable decisions to be made;
certain personages, often the head of
state, may act as mediators if autonomous conciliation breaks downj
finally, there is the legal system to arbitrate unsolved disputes which
threaten to break down the machinery of parliamentary negotiation.
Under these conditions, we should expect political conflict to be
entirely
nonviolent, and
structure change
to be
entirely
gradual.
There is always a chance for the subjected class, or its parliamentary
representatives, to take over government, or to penetrate into the
governing elites, or to make
its claims heard and accepted without
any change
in the government personnel.
The
effect of
political
democracy can be convincingly illustrated by one of its crucial, and
paradoxical, rules of the game.
If, as the result of an election, the
governing elite
is replaced in
its entirety and forced into the oppo-
sition, structure change would (according to our criteria) appear to
be extremely sudden, indeed. On a single day the personnel of all
but the bureaucratic positions of dominance is exchanged. Why does
this revolution fail to have the effect of a revolutionary change? A
complete change of government in a democratic country is, to be sure,
invariably an event of great consequence.
But
it
is mitigated by a
number of factors.
First, there is the fact that whatever changes may
occur, they do not affect the rules of the game agreed upon by both
parties.
Secondly, these rules of the game include for all parties the
legitimate expectation of attaining power in the future.
Finally, the
larger part or the whole of the administrative staff provides, in all
democratic states of the post-capitalist period, an element of stability

----- Page 327 (native) -----
classes in Post-Capitalist Society (II)
309
that survives every change.
Thus, social structure and the political
rules of the game combine to mitigate and smooth out the comparative
suddenness of changes resulting from elections and help to preserve
the gradual nature of social development arising from institutional-
ized conflict.
This is the ideal pattern of democracy j in practice, of course, there
are strains and distortions in
it, and
it would be well, here, to point
out the various deviations from the democratic pattern—departures
that are found in the actual political structure of all or some Western
countries.
These deviations are all the more serious since they arise
directly from the structure of democratic institutions or from the
rules of the game of the democratic process themselves. One example
of such deviations has already been mentioned and discussed briefly:
in its most limiting aspect, the process of political democracy allows
for a rapid succession of governments which can prevent any one
ruling group from remaining in power long enough to make
its in-
fluence felt. For all practical purposes, the top of the political hier-
archy of authority is unoccupied.
In this case, the bureaucracy of the
state becomes its own master.
Since it is unable to inaugurate anything
new,
it goes on administering the commands it was given by the last
more permanent government. The status quo is frozen, and all parties
and veto groups are unable to realize their interests. This is the kind
of development which may lead an ever-growing subjected class to
consider the abolition of "the system
itself,"
i.e., the rules of the
game that are (rightly, to some extent) blamed for the existing con-
ditions.^^
Secondly, there are no provisions in the democratic rules of the
game to prevent a party that is supported by, say, 30 per cent or even
45 per cent of the electorate from staying out of office indefinitely.
As A. Downs has shown (193), this would not happen in a perfectly
"rational" world of certainty. But in the real world there have been
and are political parties which regularly gather a substantial and often
stable share of the popular vote without ever becoming quite strong
enough to form a government. This was (and still is, here and there)
notoriously
the
case with
Socialist
parties
in European
countries.
Unless such permanent minorities have alternative channels of ex-
^® There are certain constitutional remedies, certain rules of the game, designed
to cope with
this situation;
again, France
(but also the German Federal Republic)
might be cited as an example. These rules usually take the form of restrictions imposed
on parliament with respect to voting governments out of office.

pression," they will be increasingly alienated from "the system" that
prevents them from getting "in" and increasingly irritated by the rules
of the game according to which they have no right to demand a share
in the exercise of authority.
Such permanently excluded subjected
groups are very likely to become more and more radicalized, to in-
troduce an element of violence into political conflict, and to aim at a
sudden replacement of all incumbents of positions of dominance—if
not of the whole framework of political conflict that they blame for
their ill fortunes.^"
Finally, the system of representation in modern democratic states
may lead to a situation in which
all political conflict either
is, or
is
believed to be, reduced to a struggle between competing governmental
elites.
The functionaries of political parties are so alienated from
their members that these lose all confidence in their representatives.
There
is already, in many Western countries, a widespread feeling
that "it does not matter for whom one casts one's vote," because "what-
ever one votes, the same people will always rule." This state of affairs
corresponds suspiciously closely to the dichotomous image of society
according to which
it makes no difference whether "they" call them-
selves representatives of the workers or of the employers.
It also
corresponds to the actual collusion which is so general a feature among
the representatives of political parties. What happens, here,
is that
the ruling class becomes a small elite of functionaries of nominally
different or even conflicting organizations, while the overwhelming
majority of the people form a subjected class whose every access to
authority
is blocked. The blocking is done by their so-called repre-
sentatives who, when the position of the "insiders" is threatened with
dislodgment, jealously guard the "inside" position not only of them-
selves but even of their competitors. Under these conditions, the sub-
jected class has no channel of organization but one: the one described
by Marx in his "i8th Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte."
There may
come to the fore one man, or a small group of men, who succeeds in
convincing the many that they are the "real" representatives of their
^® Such as a federal political structure which enables them to control at least state
governments.
This possibility serves as a compensating force,
e.g., in West Germany
and in Canada
(cf. Lipset,
1 99).
^° There are no formal rules of the game to provide for this eventuality; but there
is the
possibility of the
(presumably equally permanent)
government
incorporating
demands of the permanent opposition to
its policies so as to thaw the fronts of conflict
somewhat.
In any case, a permanent minority—Socialist, Communist, or otherwise
remains a disturbing element of political democracy.

311
interests, and who promises to do away with the whole "system" of
parties, parliaments, and democratic governments. Whatever the sub-
stantive outcome of such a process,
it
is certain that
it will lead to
increasingly violent conflicts.^^
It would seem that all the inherent dangers of political democracy
point to an alternative of conflict regulation which may be described
as an ideal type opposite to democracy.
In the terms of classical po-
litical thought this other extreme of the scale is oligarchy, or tyranny.
In a modern state organized along oligarchic and authoritarian lines,
the conditions of organization for opposing groups are absent. There
is but one "official" organization, if any, and outside this organization
freedom of coalition is drastically curtailed. Above all, however, such
states have no accepted routines of conflict regulation, because their
governments do not recognize the legitimacy of political conflict itself.
Wherever there are signs of "rebellion" these are forcefully sup-
pressed. The rule of the few is upheld at all costs.
Conflict theory would suggest that this kind of political organi-
zation would make for extremely violent political conflicts as well as
sudden structure changes. However, this is clearly a self-contradict-
ing conclusion.
There cannot be violent conflict and
eff^ective sup-
pression at the same time.
Either one or the other, the principles of
either conflict theory or of the ideal type of tyranny, must be wrong
if their results contradict each other.
I suggest that what
is wrong
here is the picture of the ideal type: there
is, in reality, no country
in which all conflict
is eiSFectively suppressed by force, and in which
the arbitrary rule of a small group
is upheld by sheer brutality.
In
fact, I should claim that one of the important consequences of the
approach to conflict analysis proposed in this study is that
it exposes
as mistaken the view that there are political systems based on force
^^ Considering Michels' "iron law of oligarchy," the
latter perspective would
seem to be not only a very real, but almost an inevitable, result of representative democ-
racy.
"If we accept Michels' formulation of the problem, we are faced with the fact
that modern democracies do not constitute a government by the people.
Instead,
this
form of government consists of conflicts of power among oligarchic organizations, with
the result that the average citizen exercises his rights of citizenship only in the sense
that he chooses among alternatives presented to him by these competing oligarchies"
(Bendix and Lipset, 191, p. 95). This would, however, be an overdrawn conclusion.
Depending on the rules of the game in force, some countries are in fact more affected
than others by the tendency toward collusion among the representatives:
those with
proportional representation more than those with a
relative majority system of elec-
tion; those with a multiparty system more than those with a two-party system.
Once
again, however, there
is no absolute safeguard.

alone.
Instead,
conflict theory directs our attention to those phe-
nomena in existing nondemocratic countries which can only be under-
stood as attempts to regulate political conflict. More than in the case
of democratic
countries, such approximations
to the ideal type of
tyranny as there are deviate from its patterns.
It is obvious that in those countries (post-capitalist or otherwise)
which are under Communist rule, the conditions of organization are
lacking, there
is to some extent absolute deprivation, and political
conflict
is not officially recognized as a social force.
It
is therefore
also true that a tendency toward violent conflict and sudden change
accompanies these totalitarian countries in every phase of their de-
velopment.
After the events of the last decade, there is no need to
elaborate on these facts—which, by implication, testify to the ulti-
mate
ineffectiveness of brutal suppression.
However, the modern
tyranny called totalitarianism is not as simple as we have made it here.
Suppression and nonrecognition of conflict are merely the visible facets
of a far more complex reality.
In our attempt to identify the dominant groups of contemporary
societies, we have described the ruling class of totalitarian countries
as particularly homogeneous and organized. By virtue of this fact
there
is, in totalitarian countries, a clear line of demarcation between
the rulers and the ruled. Where the party ends, the subjected class
begins. And the subjected class constitutes a large quasi-group whose
many partially divergent interests are combined into one demand—
change in the status quo of authority.
But this group
is unable to
organize itself; there is no freedom of coalition. Whatever conflicts
exist are therefore forced to remain latent or under cover.
Yet even
the "official" structure of political authority provides this subjected
quasi-group with channels of expression.
In order to recognize these,
we must remember that "discussion" is one of the crucial features of
totalitarian government. Nowhere
is there as much "discussion" as
in the one-party countries of the modern world: meetings in one's
factory or office, street or house, trade union, cooperative society, choir
or football club, school, etc., serve the one purpose of "discussing"
things.
These "discussions" are not, to be sure, opportunities for a
free exchange of ideas. They are above all attempts at indoctrination
and at soliciting that brand of "voluntary cooperation" so peculiar to
modern totalitarian
states.
But inter alia and in a minor way the
meetings and "discussions" which loom so large in the life of every
subject of totalitarian government provide a chance to voice, cautiously
and in the accepted language, criticisms of individuals and policies,

suggestions, and demands.
From the point of view of the ruling
class, this fact is both "functional" and "dysfunctional." On the one
hand, the party organization and
its varied
affiliations serve
as a
gigantic institute of opinion research which, through meetings and
"discussions," tries to explore the "wishes and feelings of the people."
On the other hand, the same meetings and "discussions"
that are
necessary for this as well as for many another purpose bring into
contact the otherwise scattered members of the subjected quasi-group
and form the nuclei of actual and future conflicts.
It
is no accident
that the revolts in Communist countries originated among those who
meet most often in large numbers: building workers, steel workers,
students.^^
Undoubtedly, meetings and "discussions" as channels of conflict
are, from the point of view of the ruling class, largely a pretext.
It
may well be that state parties explore their subjects' wishes and feel-
ings not in order to incorporate these in their policies, but in order to
see how much further they can push their own plans. However, here
again the ruthlessness of oligarchic rulers must not be exaggerated.
The skillfully ruled totalitarian countries"' are by no means stagnant.
Change and development play almost as great a part in them as they
do in democratic societies. Here, the institution of "purges" is crucial.
Some naive observers believe that purges within the new class of to-
talitarian countries are merely an expression of personal or group
rivalries. These may in fact provide the motivation of those who are
either actively or passively engaged in them, but purges serve another
purpose as well.
Like elections in democratic states they involve a
partial replacement of the governing elite, and this replacement means
in fact, or appears to mean to the subjected class, a change of policy
which incorporates interests hitherto unacknowledged. We have de-
fined structure change operationally in terms of changes affecting the
personnel of leading authority positions.
I would insist on this defini-
tion, and I suggest at the same time that an investigation of frequen-
cies and rates of change in democratic and totalitarian countries would
reveal very little difference between the two.
All this is emphatically not to say that totalitarian political systems
are not as bad as they are made out to be in the West.
It
is to say,
^^ Apart from
using
this mechanism
of channeling
social
conflict,
totalitarian
rulers are of course experts in redirecting conflict energies and providing safety-valve
institutions.
Coser's study of conflict (8l)
supplies many examples of such patterns.
^^ Nazi Germany was not, in this sense, "skillfully ruled"; but most Communist
countries of eastern Europe are.

however, that we must appraise their political structure realistically,
and that the sociological theory of conflict can help us do so. While
there is an undercurrent of potentially violent conflict aiming at sud-
den change in all totalitarian countries,
it does not follow that this
latent antagonism will break out into the open. The reason for this is
not, as so many believe, the eflFectiveness of suppression in totalitarian
states, but the existence of a hidden system of conflict regulation in
which meetings and "discussions" as well as purges play an important
part.
Horrible as this idea may be, it is possible to establish a totali-
tarian rule in which the violence of political conflict is reduced almost
as effectively as by the democratic process of
conflict regulation.^*
Suppression of conflict, however, far from helping to control politi-
cal
conflict, defeats
its own
ends:
totalitarian governments are
in
"danger" of being violently overthrown to the extent to which they
resort to suppression as a means of dealing with conflict.
TOTALITARIAN SOCIETIES VS. FREE SOCIETIES
Their modes of conflict regulation constitute one of the most im-
portant distinguishing features of democratic and totalitarian political
systems. By looking at these in terms of the institutional arrangements
set up in order to control political conflict, we are able to relate dif-
ferent forms of government to different patterns of social structure.
This is a fortiori the case with respect to the factors that influence the
intensity of political conflict. The antithesis of pluralism vs. monism
with respect to associations, scales of differentiation, and patterns of
conflict seems especially suited to describe the social bases of politi-
cal freedom. A free society encourages diversity in
its institutions
and groupings to the extent of actually promoting divergence j con-
flict
is the life breath of freedom. A totalitarian society
insists on
unity to the extent of uniformity j conflict is a threat to its coherence
and survival.
First, the intensity of political conflict depends on the presence
of the conditions of organization. We have already seen that while in
free societies subjected quasi-groups are free to organize themselves
^* The "almost" in this statement
is of course deliberate.
Clearly, the danger of
systematically
ignoring
certain
interests and groups
is much
greater
for even
the
cleverest totalitarian government than
it
is for the government of a country in which
everybody
is free to voice his discontent.
Here,
as elsewhere,
it
is safer to trust the
spontaneity of individuals and groups than to trust a "plan."
In any case, Communist
countries have not succeeded in setting up an eflfective hidden machinery of conflict
regulation.

----- Page 333 (native) -----
Classes in Post-Capitalist Society (II)

in defense of their interests, their counterparts in totalitarian societies
have to search out devious channels to make possible even a minimum
of expression of their interests. Due to the lack of the conditions of
organization, there
is a permanent, and often growing, quantity of
unreleased pressure
in totalitarian
states which imbues their latent
political conflicts with an intensity unknown in free societies, where
pressure is released almost as soon as it is created. There can be little
doubt that repression of conflict by force raises the cost of victory or
defeat.
A second determinant of the intensity of conflict is the amount of
mobility found in a given society. Without once again entering into a
detailed discussion of available evidence, we can maintain that, in the
post-capitalist societies of the West, rates of social mobility are fairly
high. There are still, to be sure, barriers in the system of social strati-
fication which are hard for the individual to overcome j but the educa-
tional institutions operate as agents of role allocation, and such biases
as there are in the educational system are increasingly being removed.
Mobility through education includes mobility between the
classes:
from manual to clerical and professional occupations, and vice versa.
Insofar as intergeneration mobility constitutes the predominant type
of fluctuation, class position may still be a largely inescapable reality
for the individual 5 but it is no longer a collective fate. The hope that
one's son might rise to the position one has oneself failed to attain is
one of the most widespread feelings of people in post-capitalist so-
ciety.
Insofar as mobility affects
it, the intensity of political conflict
has diminished considerably in the last decades.
The extent of social mobility in totalitarian societies
is not alto-
gether easy to assess. For all we know, there is a high amount of move-
ment up and down the status scale in existing totalitarian countries; in
the East, as in the West, the educational system plays an important
part.
Some observers of Soviet society have claimed that in Russia
social mobility
is indeed so widespread as to make for the type of
"classlessness" described above as the society made classless by mo-
bility.
This, however, is open to doubt.
T. Bottomore, who reports
a statement to this eflFect, holds two convincing objections against
it.
First, "the high level of mobility may ...
be regarded as a phe-
nomenon resulting from the needs of industrial development and not
any conscious attempt to promote it" (37, p. 42). Thus, many of the
present-day totalitarian countries are in fact not post-capitalist socie-
ties but societies at an early stage of industrialization, and they there-
fore display the symptoms characteristic of the industrial revolution.

----- Page 334 (native) -----
3 1
Classes in Post-Cafitalist Society (II)
Secondly, "there is in fact some evidence that social mobility is now
being restricted" (37, p. 42).
In any case, "there is no evidence that
social mobility is, at the present time, any greater than in the Western
democracies, and much evidence that it is being deliberately reduced"
(p. 43).
If we can believe Djilas, this reduction of mobility would
seem, moreover, to involve, above all, the "new class" in totalitarian
countries which increasingly
closes
itself to any influx from other
strata, especially from the subjected class. We can assume that to the
extent that this trend of closure continues, political conflict in totali-
tarian countries is becoming more intense.
Of all factors influencing the intensity of political conflict, those
of the pluralism-superimposition scale are by far the most efFective.
In order to assess their consequences, I shall resort, for a last time, to
constructing contrasting ideal types. At one extreme of the scale thus
emerging, we should find a society in which all patterns, issues, and
contexts of political conflict are superimposed and combined into two
large
hostile camps.
There
is superimposition with respect
to the
structure of authority and to the scales of rewards that make up social
stratification. Whoever occupies a position of authority has wealth,
prestige, and other emoluments of social status at his disposal, tooj
whoever is excluded from political authority has no hope of climbing
very far on the scale of social status.
Furthermore, the conflicts aris-
ing from different associations are superimposed. Power is generalized
in the sense that a homogeneous and interchangeable elite governs an
identical subjected class in the state, in industry, in the army, and in all
other associations.
Finally, such nonclass conflicts as exist in society
are congruent with the conflicts arising out of the unequal distribu-
tion of authority.
Political class conflict, industrial class conflict, re-
gional conflicts, conflicts between town and country, possibly racial and
religious conflicts—all are superimposed so as to form a single and
all-embracing antagonism.
Under these conditions, the intensity of
political conflict reaches its maximum.
As with our earlier ideal types, there is no actual society in which
this
is fully realized.
There
are, however, many
indications
that
superimposition of patterns, and the monism of social structure re-
sulting from
it, are a characteristic feature of modern
totalitarian
states. The ruling and the subjected groups of industry and the state
are identical j the party exercises its power in both associations. With
respect to the military, the same condition is aimed at, although—as
the Russian example shows—it is not attained without a struggle.
In
any case, generalized authority is the constant goal of the state party.

----- Page 335 (native) -----
classes in Post-Capitalist Society (II)
317
This generalized authority includes the attempt to monopolize every
scale of socioeconomic status for the "new class."
Its members enjoy,
apart from, or perhaps by virtue of, their authority, high incomes and
considerable prestige—although the latter is less subject to manipula-
tion than the former.^" With respect to the superimposition of class
and other conflicts, no unequivocal pattern seems discernible in to-
talitarian countries, although a tendency to alienate minorities as well
as subjected groups
in terms of authority
is not uncommon under
oligarchic rule. Divide et im'pera is an old and supposedly useful im-
perative of despotism} but with respect to the social structure of their
countries, present-day totalitarian rulers have not followed
its pre-
scription. They have, instead, aimed at a uniform and monistic or-
ganization of society.
Moreover, in the Communist countries of the
East they have adopted an ideology of intense conflict. The two go
together well:
on account of the monistic structure of conflict (and
many other)
relations in totalitarian countries, these relations have
gained, and continue to gain, in intensity. Whatever conflicts do oc-
cur involve both rulers and ruled with their whole personalities j and
if these conflicts become open and violent, the cost of defeat
is too
high for both parties to allow graceful
retreat.
"Totality" distin-
guishes the totalitarian state in more than one respect, including the
extent of the changes desired by those who, for the time being, are its
powerless subjects.
The ideal type opposite to that of totalitarianism is that of a free
society.
Here, the intensity of political conflict is reduced to a mini-
mum. The scales of social stratification are largely separate } posses-
sion of authority does not necessarily imply wealth, prestige, security.
There are competing elites at the top of the various scales.
Conflicts
in different associations are dissociated.
Leadership in the state does
not imply leadership in industry, in the army, or in other associations,
nor does exclusion from authority in one context imply exclusion in
all others.
Class conflict and other clashes between groups are dis-
sociated, too; being a member of a particular minority, race, or church
does not automatically convey certain privileges or disabilities with
respect to the distribution of political authority.
Pluralism of institu-
tions, conflict patterns, groupings, and interests makes for a lively,
colorful, and creative scene of political conflict which provides an op-
portunity for success for every interest that is voiced.
^^ They do not enjoy high "job security" nor will they be able to achieve this
under totalitarian conditions.
In view of possible
revolts and the
role of the ruling
class in them, this fact must not be underestimated.

----- Page 336 (native) -----

Classes in Post-Ca-pitalist Society (II)
Needless to say, there
is no society which corresponds in all re-
spects with this ideal-typical picture. With respect to minorities, In
particular, there
still
is a great deal of superimposition of conflict
fronts in all Western countries. Being a member of this or that church,
race, or ethnic group puts many people at a disadvantage in the strug-
gle for political authority.
Regarding the other two
factors, how-
ever, we have seen that a pluralist structure of society is in fact pro-
gressing in the post-capitalist world. One of its symptoms consists in
the institutional isolation of industry j this in turn involves some dis-
sociation of the scales of wealth and authority. By these and similar
factors, the involvement of people in political conflict decreases j in-
dividuals, veto groups, and political parties can, so to speak, afford to
lose 5 and if they win, the changes they introduce are piecemeal rather
than radical.
History is a permanent guest in a free society, not an
unwanted intruder whose presence signals revolutionary upheavals.
I concur with the common belief that the struggle between free
societies and totalitarian societies is the dominant issue of political con-
flict in our time.
Contrary to many, however, I do not believe that
this struggle is confined to international relations. The struggle be-
tween freedom and totalitarianism occurs within societies as well as
between them. No real society can be found at one or the other ex-
treme of our ideal types. There are very nearly free and very nearly
totalitarian countries, but more often we find intermediate forms.
In
the modern world, there are such paradoxical
states as democracy
without liberty and liberty without democracy.
Everywhere, how-
ever, the struggle between freedom and totalitarianism may be re-
garded as one between different attitudes toward social conflict. To-
talitarian monism is founded on the idea that conflict can and should
be eliminated, that a homogeneous and uniform social and political
order
is the desirable state of affairs.
This idea is no less dangerous
for the fact that it is mistaken in its sociological premises. The plural-
ism of free societies, on the other hand,
is based on recognition and
acceptance of social conflict.
In a free society, conflict may have lost
much of its intensity and violence, but
it
is still there, and
it is there
to stay.
For freedom in society means, above all, that we recognize
the justice and the creativity of diversity, difference, and conflict.

Sociology; Political Science
Classand Class Conflictin Industrial Society
Ralf Dahrendorf
"This book
is one of the most thoughtful attempts
to cut through
the profuse tangle that has grown up around the topic of class since
Marx.
Dahrendorf devotes himself to a fourfold
task:
a critique of
Marx's class theory, a critical analysis of some more recent writings
on the subject of class, an exposition of his own theory, and an appli-
cation of this theory
to aspects of post-capitalist society."—Pali tietil
Science Qiiarterly
"One of the most interesting theoretical studies to be published since
the war."— 77/ f^ Times Literary Supplement
"This brilliantly written and highly original work makes stimidating
reading."—^mer/ca^? Sociological Rcvieiv
"One of the most provocative contributions to social theory tha^
'
appeared in recent years.
.
.
. No sociologist concerned with ong
social theory can afford to ignore this hook."— The American Joi
of Sociology
"A marker on the road to more developed social
the-^^'
.
S<
ogists .(ud social scientists, whether inclined in the direction
.)f theory
or of
applied' science, will profit from the magistral
thesis of
this
young scholar."—Socm/ Order
