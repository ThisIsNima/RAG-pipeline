Abstract
Exosomes are small, single-membrane, secreted organelles of ∼30 to
∼200 nm in diameter that have the same topology as the cell and are en-
riched in selected proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and glycoconjugates. Ex-
osomes contain an array of membrane-associated, high-order oligomeric
protein complexes, display pronounced molecular heterogeneity, and are
created by budding at both plasma and endosome membranes. Exosome
biogenesis is a mechanism of protein quality control, and once released, ex-
osomes have activities as diverse as remodeling the extracellular matrix and
transmitting signals and molecules to other cells. This pathway of intercellu-
lar vesicle traffic plays important roles in many aspects of human health and
disease, including development, immunity, tissue homeostasis, cancer, and
neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, viruses co-opt exosome biogenesis
pathways both for assembling infectious particles and for establishing host
permissiveness. On the basis of these and other properties, exosomes are be-
ing developed as therapeutic agents in multiple disease models.

1. INTRODUCTION
In their study of secreted, vesicle-associated ATPase and nucleotidase, Trams et al. (1) defined
exosomes as secreted vesicles that “may serve a physiological function” (p. 63). In so doing, they
were the first to conceptualize vesicle secretion as a general cellular function rather than a unique
process confined to a particular cell type. Furthermore, they were the first to report that mam-
malian cells secrete vesicles of two general sizes, small vesicles ∼40 nm in diameter and larger
vesicles >500 nm in diameter (1). This size difference allowed them to separate these two classes
of secreted vesicles by the technique of differential centrifugation, as the larger vesicles prefer-
entially sediment at relatively low g force (e.g., 30 min at 10,000 × g) while the smaller vesicles
preferentially sediment at higher g force (e.g., 90–120 min at 70,000–100,000 × g) (2). The ability
to separate these two classes of vesicles by such a simple technique allowed researchers to study
them as separate entities and eventually led to the adoption of the term microvesicle to describe the
larger class of vesicles, whereas the term exosome became restricted to the smaller vesicles. Over
time, it became apparent that exosomes are enriched for a distinctive subset of cell-derived pro-
teins, nucleic acids, lipids, and glycoconjugates (3), whereas the larger microvesicles more closely
resembled the cell in composition (4). The remainder of this review focuses on the exosomes.

2. EARLY HISTORY
Descriptions of small, secreted vesicles first appeared in the late 1960s when Bonucci (5) and
Anderson (6) observed that chondrocytes secrete small vesicles of ∼100 nm. Moreover, it was clear
from these early studies that these vesicles were initiators of hydroxyapatite crystal formation and
that they budded directly from the plasma membrane (6). At the same time, Wolf (7) reported
that platelets also release small extracellular vesicles (EVs) (referred to as platelet dust) and that
they possess significant clotting activity. Over the years, these contemporaneous, landmark studies
have been both confirmed and extended, revealing roles for osteogenic exosomes in the normal
deposition of bone and tooth as well as in the pathological calcification of arteries and cardiac
tissue in cardiovascular disease (8,9),whereas thrombus-inducing exosomes can contribute to both
normal wound repair and pathological conditions, including arthritis, autoimmune disorders, and
paraneoplastic thrombosis (10, 11).
Additional lines of exosome-related inquiry opened up in the 1980s. These included the
ectoenzyme work of Trams et al. (1) and also the finding of prostate/epididymis-derived exo-
somes in seminal fluid (12, 13), vesicles that not only are required for sperm maturation but also
transfer prostate-derived proteins and lipids to and into the sperm membrane. Research in the
early 1980s also established that exosome biogenesis is a mechanism of plasma membrane pro-
tein quality control. This role was originally revealed by studies of transferrin receptor (TfR)
elimination from the plasma membrane of maturing reticulocytes, a process that appears to in-
volve selective endocytosis of TfR from the plasma membrane, TfR budding from endosome
membranes into the endosome lumen, and fusion of vesicle-containing endosomes (also known
as multivesicular bodies or MVBs) with the plasma membrane (14, 15). However, exosome-
mediated protein quality control also occurs by direct budding from the plasma membrane, as
shown for Juno, which buds directly from the zygote surface in the aftermath of fertilization
(16).
Collectively, these experimental paradigms yielded four general principles of exosome biology
that have since been confirmed by many subsequent lines of investigation: first, exosomes are
generated by budding from both the plasma membrane (6, 16) and the endosome membrane
(14, 17); second, exosomes can transfer signals and macromolecules to target cells (12, 18); third,
exosome biogenesis is a mechanism of protein quality control (14,17); and fourth,exosome biology
plays critical roles in human health and disease (8, 11).
3. EXOSOME STRUCTURE AND EXOSOME ANALYTICS
Exosomes are single-membrane vesicles that have the same topology as the cell, a diameter of
∼30 to ∼200 nm, and an otherwise unremarkable morphology. By any measure, exosome size
varies significantly, even for exosomes secreted from a single cell line. However, each exosome-
sizing technique introduces its own biases and estimates of exosome size (19–21). For example,
techniques that measure their hydrodynamic size (e.g., nanotracking particle analysis, resistive
pulse sensing, etc.) are sensitive to the size of proteins and glycans that extend from the exo-
some membrane as well as loosely adhered molecules bound to the exosome surface. In contrast,
transmission electron microscopy is insensitive to extending and adhered molecules, reporting
on only the membrane diameter. However, this measurement is also affected by several variables,
including shrinking, swelling or flattening that may occur during sample fixation, dehydration,
embedding, and imaging. Although atomic force microscopy measurements and cryo–electron
microscopy may offer relief from some of these variables, these technologies suffer from being
relatively low-throughput, inaccessible to most research groups, and limited in their informa-
tion output. Conventional light microscopy cannot detect exosomes, as they are approximately

5- to 10-fold smaller than the wavelength of light. In contrast, conventional fluorescence mi-
croscopy can detect exosomes, provided that the exosomes are labeled with fluorescent probes
specific for the exosome bilayer, exosome proteins, nucleic acids, or carbohydrates (22). In fact,
super-resolution microscopy offers the potential for determining exosome size and perhaps even
sub-exosomal cargo distribution (23). Single-particle interferometric reflectance (SPIR) imaging
can visualize individual exosome sizes in the 50- to 200-nm range, and when combined with con-
ventional fluorescence microscopy, can also detect the presence and abundance of specific lipids,
proteins, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates (24). Finally, we note that flow cytometry–like analytics
are also being applied to exosome analytics (25). However, whether exosomes generate a sufficient
light scatter signature to allow their reliable detection by flow techniques is still unclear, as they
are much smaller than the wavelength of light and are composed primarily of water. One possible
solution is to apply a fluorescence triggering approach, which in some iterations may also report
on exosome size (26). However, this approach is limited by the current need for ∼50 or more fluo-
rophores per exosome to generate a triggering signal. Moreover, this approach to exosome analysis
is likely to introduce significant empirical bias in favor of larger exosomes and higher-abundance
antigens.
Although accuracy in exosome measurements remains an intrinsically elusive goal, unbiased
cryo–electron microscopy experiments have provided important insights into the range of exo-
somes and other EVs that are circulating in human biofluids (20). Nearly all display a simple,
spheroid morphology. Of these, approximately half fell within the ∼30- to ∼200-nm–diameter
range expected of exosomes, the rest being mostly larger microvesicles. However, trace amounts
of more unusual membranous structures were also observed,some with multiple membranes,a few
with elongated, tubule-like morphologies, and others with even stranger morphologies. Although
it is formally possible that these odd structures could be generated by directed biological processes,
physical force–induced fragmentation and mechanical resealing (27) will always generate at least
some of the EVs detected in any biofluid or tissue-culture supernatant. Other contaminating el-
ements in a typical exosome preparation include lipoprotein particles (28), exomeres [a class of
small secreted particles consisting of dense protein assemblies coated with a single phospholipid
shell (29)], RNA-protein particles, and protein aggregates.
Exosomes have been described as having a density of ∼1.1–1.2 g/mL (30). However, vesicle
density is affected by the protein:lipid ratio, which varies considerably from vesicle to vesicle.
Moreover, it has been established that expression of just a single exosomal cargo protein can result
in an increase in exosome density as well as significant changes in exosome size and shape (22, 31).
Exosome density may also be affected by the action of exosomal metabolic pathways, for example,
as a consequence of hydroxyapatite crystallization by osteogenic exosomes (8). Taken together,
these considerations indicate that exosome size,shape,and density are determined primarily by the
specific protein, lipid, enzymatic, and mineral content of each individual exosome, are therefore
highly variable, and are not defining features of exosomes.
Exosome properties are directly relevant to the ways that exosomes are purified. As noted
above, exosomes and microvesicles have traditionally been defined on the basis of differential
centrifugation, with microvesicles pelleting upon 1–2 10,000 × g spins for 30 min, whereas exo-
somes are pelleted by spinning the 10,000 × g spin supernatant at 70,000–100,000 × g for 90–
120 min. However, these exosome pellet fractions contain more than just exosomes. If the starting
material is a biofluid such as plasma, this pellet may contain significant amounts of chylomicrons
and other lipoprotein particles, especially if the subject has recently fed. The 100,000 × g pellet
may also contain exomeres, large protein aggregates, ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes [e.g.,
Ago2-miRNAs (microRNAs)], and small microsomes generated by mechanical shearing of cell
membranes. Furthermore, the physics of centrifugation and the geometry of centrifuge tubes lead

to the pelleting of some exosomes in the microvesicle fraction as well as the pelleting of some
microvesicles in the exosome fraction. For these reasons, some investigations require further pu-
rification of exosomes by density gradient centrifugation, whereas others may be enhanced by
immunoaffinity purification using antibodies specific to a particular exosomal surface antigen.
However, these techniques introduce their own biases, as exosomes with a higher density may be
excluded by the former approach, whereas the latter approach will exclude exosomes that lack the
target antigen. These considerations make it clear that the relative strengths and weaknesses of
each exosome purification technique exert a significant influence on the results of many exosome-
related experiments. That being said, we are still able to review the literature with an eye to these
variables and limit our discussion to those exosomal proteins, glycans, and lipids for which the data
are of high quality, with confidence falling a bit as one moves to exosome-associated RNAs and
DNAs.
4. EXOSOME PROTEINS
Exosomes contain a broad array of transmembrane proteins, lipid-anchored membrane proteins,
peripherally associated membrane proteins,and soluble proteins of the exosome lumen (Figure 1).
This section gives an overview of some of the more important and noteworthy proteins that have
been reliably identified in the exosome membrane, on their surface, and in their lumen.

Exosomes are heterogeneous in size, heterogeneous in composition, and enriched in membrane-associated, high-order oligomeric
protein complexes. Although it is likely that no exosome contains all of these proteins, exosomes are rich in tetraspanins, adhesion
molecules, enzymes, scaffolds, RNA-binding proteins, RNAs, DNAs, and complex glycans. Those shown in the figure represent an
illustrative rather than a comprehensive list, and no single exosome is expected to contain all or even most of the proteins designated.

4.1. Integral Exosomal Membrane Proteins
Escola et al.(32) established that certain tetraspanin proteins (CD81,CD82,CD37,and CD63) are
highly enriched in exosomes, whereas generic plasma and lysosomal membrane proteins are not.
Of these, CD81 is the most highly enriched protein in exosomes, even though it is primarily local-
ized to the plasma membrane, whereas the endosome-enriched CD63 protein is the least enriched
of these proteins in exosomes. Since that initial report, CD81 and CD63 have come to be among
the most commonly used exosomal marker proteins, along with other exosomal tetraspanins, es-
pecially CD9 (33). Tetraspanins do not contain catalytic activities of their own, but rather, they
facilitate the trafficking, function, stability, and oligomerization of other membrane proteins (33).
The idea that tetraspanins mediate the exosomal inclusion of other proteins is supported by the
presence of numerous tetraspanin-associated partner proteins in exosomes, including major his-
tocompatibility complex (MHC) class II proteins (30, 32), immunoglobulin superfamily member
8 (IGSF8) (34), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) (35), syndecans (SDC1–4) (36), inte-
grins (37), and many others. The exosomal incorporation of integrins is of particular biomedical
importance, as these proteins play critical roles in development of the premetastatic niche and the
organotropism of cancer metastasis (38).
Exosomal tetraspanins also play a role in the exosomal secretion of virus-encoded membrane
proteins. For example, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent membrane protein 1 is secreted from cells
on exosomes (39), at least in part as a result of its physical interaction with CD63 (40). Other
viral membrane proteins secreted in exosomes include envelope (ENV) proteins from HIV, the
hepatitis C virus (HCV), and other enveloped viruses, consistent with the hypothesis that viruses
exploit the exosome biogenesis pathway for virion assembly and transmission (41–45). Exosomes
also contain ENV proteins encoded by endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), the genetic remnants of
ancient retroviral infections (46). Humans encode ∼30,000 ERVs, including a few nearly func-
tional ERVs, though none of the human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) are fully functional.
Among these HERVs, there are at least 19 that encode retroviral ENV proteins that have the size,
signal sequence, maturation site, and fusogenic peptide motif expected of a functional ENV pro-
tein. Some of these ENV proteins have evolved to perform physiological roles, such as syncytin-1
and syncytin-2, a pair of proteins that mediate placentation, possess membrane fusogenic activ-
ity, and are secreted from cells in exosomes (47–49). ERV ENV gene expression is repressed in
many tissues but is often activated early in development, in induced pluripotent stem cells, during
viral infections, in inflammatory disorders, and in cancer, raising the possibility that ERV ENV
expression may impact exosome tropism and exosome–cell fusion (50–52).
In addition to their well-recognized fusogenic activity, retroviral ENV proteins exhibit po-
tent immunosuppressive activity (53, 54), and this may also impact exosome function. Immuno-
suppressive activity is even more obvious for two other exosomal integral membrane proteins,
programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) (55) and CD200 (56), that suppress anti-tumor responses.
Their inclusion in cancer cell–derived exosomes may contribute to cancer immunosuppression by
allowing tumor-derived exosomes to reprogram immune responses far from the tumor site. Exo-
somes also contain many other types of integral membrane signaling proteins,including epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) (57), mast/stem cell growth factor receptor (c-Kit) (58), vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor type-2 (59), insulin-like growth factor I receptor (60), T cell re-
ceptor (61), cytokine receptors (62), G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) (62, 63), Notch recep-
tors [e.g., jagged-1, Dll4, etc. (64, 65)], and so forth. These and other exosomal signaling molecules
emphasize the fact that exosomes carry transmembrane proteins that can function as surface sig-
naling molecules and, furthermore, may also deliver functional receptors and signaling pathways
to cells that would otherwise lack these activities.

4.2. Lipid-Anchored Outer Membrane Proteins
The exosome surface is decorated with an array of lipid-anchored proteins. Among these are a
number of C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins. These include the
ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73 (66) studied by Trams et al. (1); the sperm receptor Juno (16);
the complement-inhibiting proteins CD55 and CD59 (67); glypican-1 (68); and both the cellular
prion protein (PrPC) and its amyloidogenic conformer, PrPSC (69). Other lipid-anchored proteins
of the exosome surface include the Hedgehog morphogens (70), which play important roles in
development and cancer and are anchored in the outer leaflet by their cholesterol moiety.
4.3. Peripheral Surface Proteins
Exosomes also carry peripherally associated surface proteins, many of which are also involved
in signaling. These include several wingless (Wnt) proteins and their integral membrane cargo
receptor/sorting chaperone, evenness interrupted (EVI, also known as GPR177) (71). Addition-
ally, exosomes have been found to carry surface-bound bone morphogenetic proteins (72), trans-
forming growth factor β (73), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (74), TNF-related apoptosis-inducing
ligand (75), first apoptosis signal (FAS) ligand (76), cytokines (77), and a wide array of other sur-
face signaling molecules, further reinforcing the view of exosomes as multiplexed signaling plat-
forms able to transmit complex autocrine and paracrine signals. The exosome surface is also rich
with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins such as fibronectin, tenascin C, ECM1, and so forth,
which also have important roles in signaling and adhesion (78–80). Some peripherally associated
exosomal proteins bind directly to exosome lipids, such as MfgE8/lactadherin, which binds to
phosphatidylserine (PS) in the outer leaflet of exosomes via the protein’s C1C2 domains (81).
4.4. Lipid-Anchored Inner Membrane Proteins
The exosome inner membrane is rich in acylated, lipid-anchored proteins. These include preny-
lated small GTPases (Rabs, Ras, Rho, etc.), myristoylated signaling kinases (e.g., Src), and palmi-
toylated membrane proteins (82–84). Within this class of proteins, virally encoded, acylated Gag
proteins can come to dominate the composition of exosomes released by infected cells (22, 31).
In addition to what occurs in cells infected with exogenous retroviruses such as HIV or HTLV-1,
mammalian cells express acylated Gag proteins from endogenous retroviral elements, including
>90 from the HERV-K family of retroelements (46, 85). When expressed, HERV-K Gag proteins
are targeted to sites of exosome biogenesis and secreted from the cell in exosomes, the same as
Gag proteins encoded by HIV and HTLV-1 (22, 31, 86). HERV Gag proteins are strongly ex-
pressed during the blastocyst stage of development in stem cells, testis, placenta, virally infected
cells, a wide array of cancers, and selected other cell types and conditions (50–52). Furthermore,
some Gag proteins have evolved to execute physiological functions. The most interesting of these
(so far) is activity-regulated cytoskeletal (ARC) protein, a Gag-like protein that plays critical roles
in learning and memory. ARC expression is activated by learning, and the ARC proteins are se-
creted from the cell in exosomes, are taken up by neighboring cells, and mediate the intercellular
trafficking of their own messenger RNA (mRNA) (87, 88).
4.5. Inner Peripheral Membrane Proteins: A Scaffold Web
The inner cortex of exosomes is rich in proteins that link cytoplasmic tails of exosomal mem-
brane proteins to one another, to other cross-linking proteins, to other partner proteins, and to
lipids. These scaffolding factors include the ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) proteins (89–91), which

respond to signal-induced phosphorylation by cross-linking plasma membrane proteins to cy-
toskeletal proteins and other scaffolds (92). Not surprisingly, exosomes are rich in ERM proteins
and ERM ligands, including EBP50, CD44, CD43, IGSF8, PTGFRN, and so forth (93–95). Syn-
tenin is another exosomal scaffolding factor and is known to cluster exosomal proteins via its mul-
tiple protein-binding motifs. Syntenin also binds phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) in
the inner leaflet of the membrane. Interestingly, syntenin has a complex interaction with the exo-
somal tetraspanin CD63, as high syntenin expression has been shown to retain CD63 at the plasma
membrane by masking its constitutive endocytosis signal [recognized by AP-2 (96)]. Syntenin also
plays a critical role in the exosomal sorting of SDCs (36, 97) and interacts with Alix (98).
Alix represents yet another class of exosomal scaffolding protein, as it binds not only to syn-
tenin but also to tumor suppressor gene 101 protein (TSG101) and charged multivesicular body
protein 4 (CHMP4) of the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRTs). The
ESCRT machinery is comprised of the ESCRT-0, ESCRT-I, ESCRT-II, and ESCRT-III protein
complexes, which function together with the vacuolar protein sorting gene 4 (VPS4) protein AAA
ATPase in pathways as diverse as MVB biogenesis, cytokinesis, nuclear envelope resealing, au-
tophagy, and virus budding (99, 100). These ESCRT activities inspired the hypothesis that
ESCRTs would also catalyze exosome budding (45). However, this hypothesis has been surpris-
ingly poor at predicting experimental outcomes,as multiple laboratories have found no substantive
decrease in exosome biogenesis following ESCRT inhibition (31, 101, 102). Nevertheless, exo-
somes clearly contain ESCRT proteins, and TSG101 has emerged as a commonly used marker of
exosomes. Although the role that ESCRTs play in exosome biogenesis remains a topic of active
debate (see Section 8.4), it is clear that proteins of the ESCRT-0 and ESCRT-I complex bind to a
large number of membrane-associated and cytoplasmic proteins, induce their high-order hetero-
oligomerization, and are themselves present in exosomes. Thus, the ESCRT-0 and ESCRT-I pro-
teins may be responsible for piggyback-style import of ubiquitylated proteins and pro-thr/ser-ala-
pro (PT/SAP) motif–containing proteins into exosomes (103–106).
In addition to these diverse scaffolding proteins, the inner exosome membrane is also enriched
in molecular chaperones, which bind to aggregated and misfolded proteins (107). The presence
of heat shock proteins (HSPs) in exosomes was first reported by Mathew et al. (108), who noted
that exosomal HSP70 is tightly associated with exosomal TfR during its vesicular secretion from
reticulocytes.Multiple heat shock proteins have since been reported in exosomes,including several
members of the HSP70 family, Hsp40/DnaJ proteins, Hsp90, Hsp20, Hsp27, and α/β-crystallins
(89, 109–112).
4.6. Exosomal Enzymes
Exosomes are secreted, membranous, metabolically active platforms. This concept was evident
in their very earliest descriptions as osteogenic vesicles loaded with enzymes involved in bone
formation (1, 6). These include CD39, CD73, phosphatases, pyrophosphatases, calcium-binding
anexins, and phosphate transporters (8, 66). Exosomes also contain RNA editing enzymes, lipases,
proteases, glycosyltransferases, glycosidases, and metabolic enzymes, many of which have the po-
tential to modify exosome content (44, 89, 111–115), raising the possibility that exosomes rep-
resent a reservoir for generating macromolecules that are chemically distinct from their cellular
forms. Cancer cell–derived exosomes have an even greater enzymatic repertoire owing to their
exosomal packaging of mutant Ras proteins (82), receptors (57, 58), and hyaluronan synthase-3
(113) and their RNA interference processing activities (95). Exosomes have also been reported
to include key enzymes of energy metabolism, but it has recently been reported that these may
actually be enriched in exomeres rather than vesicles (29).

4.7. Soluble Proteins and Bulk Inclusion
Exosomes are highly enriched in certain cargo proteins, especially CD81, CD9, and CD63 (32,
111). However, more than 3,000 proteins have been reported to be present in exosomes released
by just a single cell line (112), with no idea of how many of these proteins are actually enriched in
exosomes. Given that many of the proteins listed in the “Exosome Markers” table on the ExoCarta
database (115a) are among the most abundant proteins in the cell (e.g., actin, tubulin, glycolytic
enzymes, etc.) and that heterologous expression of bacterial or synthetic proteins often leads to
their exosomal secretion (116, 117), it may be that exosome biogenesis involves some amount of
bulk inclusion of cytoplasm and membrane contents, with only a small subset of exosomal proteins
showing signs of active sorting. Under such a model, soluble proteins may be incorporated only
rarely in exosomes and would be free to act in recipient cells following exosome–cell fusion. This
principle has been elegantly exploited for therapeutic purposes using a light-induced exosomal
targeting and release system (118).
4.8. Exosomal Protein Heterogeneity
If exosomes have a defining feature, it is that they are so heterogeneous that they resist further
definition beyond that of small, secreted vesicles with the same topology as the cell (2). The pro-
nounced heterogeneity of exosomes is actually expected from their limited carrying capacity (in-
dividual vesicles of ∼30- to ∼200-nm diameter can carry only a limited subset of proteins and
other cargoes) as well as mechanistic and stochastic forces that drive differential protein distribu-
tion along the spectrum of endosome and plasma membranes. After all, the fact that cells make
exosomes at both plasma and endosome membranes suggests that the composition of individual
exosomes will be determined primarily by the nanometer-scale concentrations of exosome car-
goes in the vicinity of each nascent exosome (119). Another mechanistic driver of exosome het-
erogeneity is differential gene expression. For example, exosomes secreted by antigen-presenting
cells contain high levels of MHC class II proteins and costimulatory proteins (30, 32), whereas ex-
osomes released from other cell types lack these proteins. Furthermore, environmentally induced
changes in gene expression have the potential to drive exosome heterogeneities in response to diet
(fed versus fasted), circadian rhythms (night versus day), hormones (stress, estrus), physical activity
(exercise versus sedentariness), infections (infected versus uninfected), stage of cell cycle (G1, S,
G2, M), and so forth.
Protein concentration within the cytoplasm and membranes also varies in a stochastic manner
as a result of diffusion, dissociation of protein complexes, and other physico-chemical processes,
further amplifying mechanistic drivers of protein concentration differences along endosome and
plasma membranes. Exosome-to-exosome variations may also reflect steric exclusion, whereby
extremely large exosomal cargoes (e.g., ERV Gag proteins, ARC, heparan sulfate proteoglycans,
etc.) occupy so much of the limited space in a nascent exosome that they impair the loading of
other exosomal cargo proteins.Also,the possibility that exosome biogenesis involves some amount
of bulk cytoplasm and membrane inclusion virtually assures that each exosome varies in content
from every other exosome. Finally, gene transcription also fluctuates in a stochastic manner, giving
rise to significant cell-to-cell differences in gene expression (120,121) that may also affect exosome
cargo composition. Taken together, these considerations make a compelling case that exosome
heterogeneity is not a problem that either can or needs to be resolved but, instead, is merely the
inevitable consequence of a mechanism of exosome biogenesis that acts at multiple locations along
the spectrum of endosome and plasma membranes.

5. EXOSOME GLYCOCONJUGATES AND LIPIDS
The outermost surface of the exosome consists of a glycan canopy attached to surface proteins
and certain outer leaflet lipids. This canopy has been interrogated by lectin panning and other
approaches, identifying an exosomal enrichment for α-2,6-sialic acid and heparan sulfate but an
otherwise heterogeneous population of surface carbohydrates (122, 123). Cancer cell–derived ex-
osomes are yet again a bit different, as their glycan signature varies with expression of various gly-
cosidases and glycosyl transferases. For example, some cancers express elevated levels of hyaluro-
nan synthase 3, resulting in the synthesis of long polymers of hyaluronic acid that promote cancer
growth and drive exosome biogenesis (113).Other cancers are known to express heparanase,which
cleaves heparin sulfate proteoglycan chains. Interestingly, exogenous addition of heparanase alle-
viates an apparent steric block to SDC budding (114), augmenting the release of SDC-containing
exosomes.
Beneath this glycan canopy, the exosome membrane contains phosphatidylcholine (PC), phos-
phatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylinositols (PIs), phosphatidic
acid (PA),cholesterol,ceramides,sphingomyelin,glycosphingolipids,and a number of lower abun-
dance lipids (124, 125). The overall concentration of lipids in purified exosomes differs from that
of the plasma and other cellular membranes and these differences may provide clues about the
mechanisms of exosome biogenesis. However, one of the most notable features of the exosome
bilayer is that it has PE and PS in its outer leaflet (22, 126), whereas PE and PS are normally
depleted from the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane by phospholipid flippases. It is widely
assumed that outer-leaflet PS is a hallmark of apoptotic cells, but PE and PS can also be detected
in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane in certain healthy, nonapoptotic cells (22, 31, 86, 126),
and microdomains enriched in outer-leaflet PE and PS appear to participate in exosome biogen-
esis. Exosome membranes are also enriched in lysophospholipids [perhaps as a result of exosome-
associated PLA2 activity (127)], cholesterol, gangliosides, sphingolipids, and ceramides, the last
of which have been shown to stimulate exosome production (101). Given that exosomes have a
strong membrane curvature, it is inevitable that they would contain high levels of cone-shaped
and inverse cone–shaped lipids, which include PE, PS, lysophospholipids, PA, and ceramides.
6. EXOSOMAL RNAs
Exosomes contain RNAs and can transfer these extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) in functional form
to other cells and tissues. This phenomenon was first described by Ratajczak et al. (128), who
reported that stem cell exosomes containing RNAs, including Oct-4 mRNA, can transfer Oct-
4 mRNA to other cells and that this leads to elevated Oct-4 expression in recipient cells. The
existence of exosomal RNAs and exosome-mediated transfer was subsequently confirmed and ex-
tended by Valadi et al. (129), who described exosome-mediated mRNA transfer between mast
cells; by Skog et al. (130), who described exosome-mediated, intercellular transfer of glioblastoma
RNAs; and by Pegtel et al. (131), who provided the first functional context for exosome-mediated
miRNA transfer. Taken together, these four articles expanded the central paradigm of molecu-
lar biology by establishing that RNAs transcribed in one cell can be released into an acellular
intermediate and subsequently taken up by, and expressed in, other cells.
Individual exosomes do not seem to carry large amounts of RNA molecules, but what they
do contain represents a heavily skewed subpopulation of cellular RNAs. Exosomal RNA survey
studies have found that these organelles are particularly enriched in small noncoding RNAs (ncR-
NAs), including small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), miRNAs, transfer RNAs (tRNAs), Y RNAs, vault
RNAs, repetitive element RNAs, and fragmented RNAs, including 3′ mRNA fragments (132,
133). Overall, exosomal RNAs are enriched in specific RNA species relative to the cellular RNA

profile, whereas the microvesicle RNA profile appears more similar to that of the cell (132). Ex-
osomal RNAs show some evidence of specific modification, such as the enrichment of miRNAs
with 3′-end nucleotide additions (134) and 5′-terminal oligopyrimidine (135), which could be re-
lated to as-yet-unknown exosomal sorting and/or RNA quality control mechanisms. It should also
be noted that exosomal RNA analysis is particularly sensitive to contamination by DNA as well as
to biases that are introduced by all known techniques for RNA extraction, amplification, adapter
ligation, purification, and sequencing (132, 133, 136).
Current evidence suggests that several mechanisms act in parallel to load exosomes with RNAs,
with specific subsets of RNAs bound to distinct exosome-targeted RNA-binding proteins (RBPs).
For example, the miRNA effector Ago2, which shows little evidence of exosomal inclusion in
several cell types, may display progressively higher incorporation in more aggressively metastatic
cancer cells (95) as well as in response to oncogene expression (137). Although exosomal miRNA
content may in some cases follow the amount of exosomal Ago2 (95, 137), exosomes are par-
ticularly enriched in miRNAs that contain a GGAG motif and that are bound by exosomal hn-
RNPA2B1 (138). The SYNCRIP protein binds to yet another exosomal miRNA sequence motif
and appears critical for its enrichment in hepatocyte-derived exosomes (139). Using a sophisti-
cated cell-free reconstitution approach, Shurtleff and coworkers (133, 140) established that YBX1
also plays a role in the exosomal sorting of miRNAs and other small ncRNAs, while other groups
have identified important contributions for the major vault protein and Hu (141, 142). Gag and
Gag-like proteins also impact exosomal RNA content, as Gag proteins bind their genomic RNA
and other RNAs and coimport them into nascent exosomes (87, 88, 143). A crucial factor in inter-
preting current literature is that most studies examine the RNA composition of exosomes only in
bulk, rather than on a single-particle level, and therefore likely underreport the actual complexity
of exosomal RNAs (144).
7. EXOSOMAL DNA
Exosomes contain DNA, including single-stranded DNA, double-stranded DNA, genomic DNA,
mitochondrial DNA, and even reverse-transcribed complementary DNAs (145–148). Unlike
other exosomal cargoes, it is not yet clear if selective sorting of specific DNAs into exosomes
occurs. In fact, some reports indicate that sequencing exosome-associated DNA will reveal the
complete genome sequence of the cell from which the exosomes arose (146, 147). It is also not
clear how much of the exosomal DNA is inside the organelle and how much is bound to the surface.
As for the physiological roles of exosomal DNA, exosome-based DNA secretion may contribute
to DNA quality control, perhaps in the regulation of inflammation, and may turn out to be a useful
marker of cancer, viral infection, or chemotherapeutic resistance.
8. EXOSOME BIOGENESIS
8.1. Sites of Exosome Biogenesis
Exosomes can arise by vesicle budding into endosomes,with subsequent release upon vesicle-laden
endosomes (MVBs) with the plasma membrane (Figure 2). This mode of exosome biogenesis was
inspired by studies on the vesicular secretion of TfR by maturing reticulocytes (14, 17) and has
gained support from studies in other biological systems, too (149). Electron microscopy studies
have provided the bulk of evidence for this model, but it has also drawn support from genetic
studies showing MVB accumulation and decreased exosome release in cells depleted of Rab27
(84) or Ral (150). In addition, genetically encoded, pH-sensitive CD63–pHluorin fusion proteins
have been used to detect MVB–plasma membrane fusion events (151).This experimental approach

Figure 2
Exosomes bud from endosome and plasma membranes. Exosome biogenesis occurs by three modes:
(●
1 ) vesicle budding into discrete endosomes that mature into multivesicular bodies, which release exosomes
upon plasma membrane fusion; (●
2 ) immediate release by direct vesicle budding from the plasma membrane;
and (●
3 ) delayed release by budding at intracellular plasma membrane–connected compartments (IPMCs)
followed by deconstriction of IPMC neck(s).
was also used by Verweij et al. (144) to demonstrate roles for synaptosomal-associated protein-23
(SNAP23) and syntaxin-4 in MVB–plasma membrane fusion as well as its regulation by GPCR
signaling via SNAP23 phosphorylation.
The existence of an endosomal mode of exosome biogenesis does not, however, mean that all
exosomes arise only by endosomal budding. In fact, multiple lines of evidence show that exosomes
also bud from the plasma membrane (see 9, 16, 22, 31, 63, 86, 90, 119, 104, 152–157). Unfor-
tunately, these are largely ignored by most cartoon models of exosome biogenesis, which instead
convey an endosome-only view of exosome biogenesis (149,158).Curiously,the widespread accep-
tance of this endosome-only model of exosome biogenesis has occurred in the complete absence
of supporting data, as no published study has even attempted to compare the relative budding of
exosomes from plasma and endosome membranes, much less show that exosomes do not bud from
the plasma membrane. As a result, it appears that the endosome-only model of exosome biogenesis
consists of little more than the paired assertions that (a) any vesicle that buds via endosomes is an
exosome and (b) all exosome-like vesicles arise via endosomal budding, assertions that bear closer
resemblance to a circular argument than a scientific hypothesis.
As for the evidence that exosomes bud from the plasma membrane, it is robust (Figure 2).
Atomic force microscopy experiments demonstrated that the budding of exosomes (vesicles of
∼50- to ∼100-nm diameter) at the plasma membrane of stem cells occurs at rates equal to their
production of exosomes (152). Moreover, this finding matches earlier electron microscopic evi-
dence that stem cells bud ∼50- to ∼100-nm–diameter vesicles directly from the plasma membrane
(153). Electron microscopy experiments also show the presence of exosome budding intermedi-
ates at the plasma membrane of human leukocytes (9, 22, 31). Furthermore, multiple laboratories
have established that exosomal protein and lipid markers are selectively enriched at discrete
domains of leukocyte plasma membranes (22, 31, 86, 90, 154). Plasma membrane exosomal

budding is also observed for glioblastoma exosomes (155), the protein Juno (16), GPCRs (63),
and ARRDC1 (104) and occurs in organisms as diverse as mammalian cells and Caenorhabditis
elegans (156). Another supporting line of evidence comes from the recent discovery that certain
cell types contain deep invaginations of the plasma membrane that are indistinguishable from
MVBs by conventional transmission electron microscopy (157, 159, 160). These intracellular
plasma membrane–connected compartments (IPMCs) are continuous with the extracellular
milieu via necks that allow free passage of extracellular buffer and small-molecule probes but
prevent exit of vesicles, allowing them to serve as reservoirs of vesicle accumulation and sources
for pulsatile release (160). IPMCs also overlap with sites of retrovirus budding, underscoring the
commonality between exosome and viral biology (41, 44, 45, 161, 162). Taken together, these
observations argue strongly against the endosome-only hypothesis of exosome biogenesis and
suggest instead that exosomes are likely to be made at both plasma and endosome membranes.
This conclusion is also supported by a recent study of CD63 and CD9 budding, which showed
that exosome cargo proteins bud primarily from the plasma membrane of certain cell types
and that exosome composition is determined predominantly by intracellular protein trafficking
pathways, rather than by distinct mechanisms of exosome biogenesis (119).
In the face of these observations, one is left to wonder why so many researchers have embraced
a working hypothesis that is founded on little more than a circular argument. In our opinion,
observational bias may have played an important role. This is perhaps most obvious for electron
microscopy of intact cells, which over-samples the endosomal mode of exosome biogenesis, due
to the fact that the products of this mode are retained within easily recognized MVBs, while
simultaneously undersampling the products of plasma membrane exosome biogenesis, due to
the fact that they are washed away during sample preparation. The only way to correct this
pronounced observational bias would be to refocus electron microscopic analysis on the relative
number of exosome budding intermediates at all endosomes and plasma membranes of a cell, a
goal that could only be approached by detailed three-dimensional electron microscopic tomog-
raphy. Logical fallacies might also contribute to the endosome-only view of exosome biogenesis.
For example, there may be some who incorrectly conflate all plasma membrane budding with
the budding of microvesicles, which are much larger, micron-sized extracellular vesicles that bud
directly from the plasma membrane (4).
8.2. Exosomal Protein Sorting Information
Identifying the cis-acting information that targets proteins into nascent exosomes is a key step
in elucidating the mechanisms of exosome biogenesis. In other organelle biogenesis pathways,
protein targeting is typically mediated by short peptide signals that are recognized by import
receptors, which then ferry their cargoes to and into their cognate organelles (163). However, ex-
osomal protein sorting information is a bit different. The first clue to this difference came from
observing the subcellular distribution of exosome marker proteins in human T cells. Specifically,
these cells cluster exosomal proteins at a single pole of the plasma membrane (22), reminiscent
of surface protein caps formed by cross-linking plasma membrane proteins (164). Working from
this clue, antibody-induced oligomerization was found to be sufficient to target plasma membrane
proteins to exosomes (31).Fang et al.(31) also showed the corollary,that appending a plasma mem-
brane anchor to otherwise cytoplasmic, high-order oligomeric proteins targets them to exosomes,
too. Taken together, these results showed that high-order oligomerization and plasma membrane
binding are sufficient to target proteins into exosomes. This conclusion has subsequently been
affirmed in multiple contexts. For example, one can create a synthetic exosomal cargo protein
merely by linking a plasma membrane anchor to two independent oligomerization domains (31).
Shen et al. (154) extended this hypothesis further by showing that virtually any plasma membrane

anchor could support exosomal protein budding but that an endosome membrane anchor could
not. This model has been further reinforced by the observation that plasma membrane–localized
forms of CD63 and CD9 bud from cells much more efficiently than endosome-targeted forms of
the same proteins (119).
The fact that high-order oligomerization and plasma membrane binding target proteins to ex-
osomes is consistent with much of what we know about the exosomal cargo proteins described
in Section 4 of this review. This includes the enhanced budding of aggregated, amyloidogenic
PrPSC relative to PrPC (69,165),aggregation-associated exosomal sorting of TfR (166),activation-
induced exosomal sorting of receptor tyrosine kinases (57), and stress-induced exosomal sorting of
heat shock proteins (167). Indirect support is also evident in the fact that so many exosomal pro-
teins form membrane-associated, high-order, homo-oligomeric and/or hetero-oligomeric protein
complexes. These include the (a) integral membrane tetraspanins (e.g., CD81, CD9, and CD63)
(33); (b) diverse scaffold proteins (e.g., ERM proteins, syntenin, Alix); (c) endogenous and exoge-
nous Gag proteins (100, 168); (d) aggregated proteins implicated in neurodegeneration (69, 165);
and (e) proteins of the ESCRT machinery, which is the epitome of a membrane-associated, high-
order, oligomeric protein complex (99, 100).
Although the oligomerization-induced budding of plasma membrane proteins is clear, a good
model that shows how high-order oligomerization and plasma membrane binding generate a bio-
chemical signal that leads to protein budding does not currently exist. One as-yet-untested possi-
bility is that membrane-embedded, high-order oligomers/aggregates generate as nanometer-scale
islands of desolvated, membrane-embedded protein, and that these favor membrane vesiculation.
In support of this idea, it has been shown that protein clustering is itself sufficient to induce mem-
brane scission (168a). Whatever the mechanisms, the fact that high-order oligomerization induces
the exosomal secretion of many exosomal proteins raises another question, which is how cells limit
the size of growing,high-order oligomers/aggregates so that they do not exceed the physical carry-
ing capacity of exosomes. In fact, an oligomerization-induced pathway of exosomal protein sorting
virtually demands that cells possess a machinery that disassembles membrane-associated protein
complexes that exceed a certain size limit.
The existence of an aggregation and membrane-binding pathway for exosomal protein target-
ing does not preclude the existence of other cis-acting exosomal targeting signals. For example,
some exosomal proteins will be incorporated into exosomes in a piggyback fashion, bound to
primary exosomal cargoes. In such instances, the binding sites between these proteins will display
all the properties expected of protein-targeting motifs. This mode of import is supported by the
abundance of scaffold proteins and chaperones in exosomes. Among these, the ESCRT-0 complex
may play a role in recruiting monoubiquitinated proteins into exosomes, whereas TSG101 of the
ESCRT-I complex may recruit proteins carrying PT/SAP motifs into exosomes (36, 99, 100, 104,
106).
In addition to positive targeting information, it has been reported that exosomal protein bud-
ding can be blocked in cis by addition of a 16-amino-acid-long inhibitory budding signal (169).
Addition of this peptide blocks the budding of CD63 and many other exosomal proteins. To func-
tion, this inhibitory budding signal requires cytoplasmic exposure and positioning at the extreme
C terminus of the protein, raising the possibility that it acts by linking proteins to an as-yet-
unknown cytoplasmic retention factor.
8.3. Physico-Chemical Aspects of Exosome Biogenesis
Exosome biogenesis is, at its most fundamental level, the outward budding of small, ∼30- to
∼200-nm–diameter vesicles from plasma and endosome membranes (outward = away from the

cytoplasm). As in all membrane vesiculation processes, lipids are critical players in exosome bio-
genesis, especially those able to form cone and inverse cone shapes. In this context, it is notable
that exosomes are rich in outer leaflet PE and PS (22, 31, 166). A direct role of outer leaflet PE
in exosome biogenesis is suggested by the increase in exosome budding in mutants lacking a PE
flippase (150). PS is similarly subject to flippase-mediated asymmetry, and outer leaflet PS is also
present in living cells (126) at microdomains that coincide with sites of plasma membrane exosome
budding. These observations raise the interesting possibility that plasma membrane asymmetry
of PE and PS may serve as a general repressor of exosome biogenesis at the cell surface. Other
phospholipids that may promote exosome biogenesis include PA, a cone-shaped lipid produced
by PLD2, which has been implicated in budding of certain exosomal cargoes (158), and lysophos-
pholipids, which are generated by exosomal phospholipase A2 enzymes (127).
In addition to the above phospholipids,ceramide abundance has been positively correlated with
an increase in exosome biogenesis, whereas inhibition of an enzyme that generates ceramide [neu-
tral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2)] sometimes impairs exosome biogenesis (101). The simplest
interpretation of such data is that ceramide enhances exosome budding by facilitating the mem-
brane curvature necessary for membrane vesiculation. However, elevating ceramide has direct
effects on many processes other than exosome biogenesis (170), including autophagy, apoptosis,
metabolism, and signaling, any one of which might have an indirect effect on exosome biogenesis.
Ceramide also sits at the crossroads of multiple lipid metabolic pathways, and elevating ceramide
is therefore likely to impact the abundance of multiple other lipids (e.g., sphingomyelin, diacyl-
glycerol, etc.), any one of which might also impact exosome biogenesis.
Another impact of lipids on exosome biogenesis may be related to the concept of lipid rafts/
detergent-resistant membranes (124). These entities are thought to drive the clustering, distribu-
tion, and function of the hypothetical lipid raft–associated proteins, particularly GPI-anchored
proteins (171). However, there are persistent and well-founded arguments that challenge the
hypothesis that lipid rafts are significant regulators of protein trafficking and function in bi-
ological membranes (172, 173). Regarding the possible involvement of lipid rafts in exosome
biogenesis, no definitive evidence has been found one way or another, but we point out that
certain proteins that associate with detergent-resistant membranes do not bud from cells in
exosomes (169) and that certain GPI-anchored proteins also do not bud from cells in exosomes
(174).
8.4. Trans-Acting Mediators of Exosome Release
In addition to the physico-chemical processes that may contribute to exosome biogenesis, exo-
some biogenesis involves trans-acting factors that mediate intracellular protein trafficking path-
ways, mechanisms of MVB maturation and trafficking, plasma membrane homeostasis, IPMC
biogenesis, and last but not least, vesicle protrusion and scission.
8.4.1. Rab proteins regulate exosome biogenesis via endosomes and the plasma membrane.
Rab proteins determine organelle membrane identity, recruit mechanistic effectors, and mediate
organelle dynamics (175).In a screen for Rab proteins that might play a role in exosome biogenesis,
Ostrowski et al. (84) found that Rab27a, Rab27b, and their effectors Slp4, Slac2b, and Munc13-4
play roles in MVB biogenesis and positioning. Depending on the cell line, loss of Rab27 function
results in an ∼50–75% drop in exosome production, or little to no change in exosome biogene-
sis whatsoever. Furthermore, there is no consensus about how Rab27 proteins regulate exosome
biogenesis. Although some propose that Rab27 proteins mediate MVB maturation and traffick-
ing to the plasma membrane (84, 149), further work by Ostrowski and colleagues (86) revealed
that Rab27a is also required for assembling plasma membrane microdomains involved in plasma

membrane vesicle budding by regulating plasma membrane PIP2 dynamics (22). Thus, it appears
that Rab27 proteins control exosome biogenesis at both endosome and plasma membranes.
Rab35 also contributes to exosome biogenesis, as its loss reduces exosome release by ∼50%
(83). Rab35 localizes primarily to the plasma membrane, where it also contributes to regulation of
plasma membrane PIP2 levels (176). Loss of Rab35 deprives the plasma membrane of its molecular
identity, impairing the rapid recycling of plasma membrane proteins and lipids back to the cell
surface (176). Rab11 is also implicated in exosome biogenesis (177) but not at the level of MVB–
plasma membrane fusion. Rather, Rab11 appears to influence exosome biogenesis via a calcium-
induced homotypic fusion/maturation of MVBs, upstream of exosome release (178). Calcium-
induced exosome release also appears to require Munc13-4 (179), an effector for both Rab11 and
Rab27 proteins (84).
8.4.2. A Ral/Arf6/PLD2/syntenin/Alix axis. Inhibition of the Ral family of small GTPases
has been reported to cause an accumulation of MVBs near the plasma membrane and an
∼50% decrease in the vesicular secretion of exosomes and exosomal marker proteins (150). Ral
GTPases act through numerous effectors, and two of these are also implicated in exosome bio-
genesis, the small GTPase Arf6 and the phospholipase PLD2 (180). Arf6 and PLD2 contribute to
the exosomal release of SDCs, which also appears to be dependent on a pair of exosomal scaffolds,
syntenin and Alix. However, the loss of these factors has no effect on the vesicular secretion of
common exosomal marker proteins such as CD9 and flotillins (97). This axis of factors appears to
be particularly important for the exosomal budding of the syndecan proteins, a group of heavily
modified heparin sulfate glycoproteins. Interestingly, the vesicular secretion of SDCs appears to
be repressed by their glycosylation, as heparanase induces their vesicular secretion (114).
8.4.3. ESCRTs. The ESCRT machinery contributes to membrane deformation, sealing, and
repair during a wide array of processes, including MVB biogenesis, nuclear envelope sealing,
plasma membrane repair, cytokinetic abscission, and virus budding (100). It is widely accepted
that ESCRTs mediate these processes, at least in part, by catalyzing membrane scission events
that are topologically identical to exosome biogenesis. It was therefore somewhat obvious to hy-
pothesize that exosome biogenesis would be an ESCRT-dependent process (45). However, this
hypothesis has a surprising lack of empirical support, and many solid empirical observations run
counter to its core predictions. For example, it is well established that the ESCRT machinery
cannot function in vivo without the VPS4 ATPase (99, 100), and yet, ablation of VPS4 function
had no effect on the exosomal secretion of CD63 and other exosomal markers (31). This is not an
isolated observation, as similar results were independently reported by Trajkovic et al. (101) and
Colombo et al. (102).
The challenge with these empirical observations is how to reconcile them with the other data
on ESCRTs and exosomes. For example, there is no doubt that TSG101, HRS, and several other
ESCRT proteins are present in exosomes, or that the full ESCRT machinery (i.e., VPS4 activ-
ity) is required for MVB formation, virus budding, cytokinesis, and other topologically similar
membrane scission events. Although we do not know how these various observations fit together,
one possible way forward is to consider the possibility that ESCRTs play multiple roles in exo-
some biogenesis but not in vesicle scission. For example, it is possible that the ESCRT machinery
contributes to exosome biogenesis by limiting the size of highly oligomeric cargoes, which may
explain why loss of ESCRTs prevents the budding of viral capsids but not of exosomal vesicles or
exosomal cargoes like CD63. ESCRTs may also contribute to exosome biogenesis as a scaffold,
recruiting subsets of exosomal cargoes into nascent vesicles. Such a mechanism could explain why

loss of ESCRT-0 or ESCRT-I proteins leads to a modest drop in exosome biogenesis in systems
where loss of VPS4 function has no effect on exosome biogenesis (102, 156).
8.4.4. Autophagy. Exosome secretion is also influenced by autophagy pathways. Autophagy-
related (Atg) proteins coordinate initiation, nucleation, and elongation during autophagosome
biogenesis, a process that also requires ESCRT-III components, including CHMP2A and VPS4.
Interestingly, exosome production is severely reduced in cancer cells that lack Atg5 (181). In con-
trast, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of Atg5 in neuronal cells increases the release of exo-
somes and exosome-associated prions from neuronal cells (182). An autophagy/lysosome connec-
tion with exosomes is also suggested by the role of exosomes in the accumulation and spread of
pathogenic protein aggregates in GBA deficiency (183).
9. EXOSOME UPTAKE
Exosome uptake is topologically similar to well-established models of virus–cell interactions. For
example, HIV initiates infection by fusing with the plasma membrane. However, cells take up
HIV virions by several other pathways, including macropinocytosis, phagocytosis, and multiple
modes of endocytosis (184). Given that this one virus is taken up by a plethora of pathways, it
is not surprising that exosome uptake has also been linked to multiple mechanisms, including
macropinocytosis, phagocytosis, clathrin-dependent endocytosis, and clathrin-independent en-
docytosis (41, 185).
The rich literature on viral uptake mechanisms provides useful paradigms for exploring the
mechanisms of exosome uptake. However, exosomes differ from viruses in many ways, and these
differences must be taken into account in any study of exosome uptake. For example, the func-
tional outcome of exosome uptake may be far more nuanced and multifactorial than that of viral
uptake. Exosomes are rich in macromolecules, and there may be contexts in which exosome uptake
is nothing more than a form of feeding/nutrient uptake. Also, the ability of exosomes to deliver
signals and functional macromolecules to and into recipient cells and the pronounced hetero-
geneity of exosomes mean that these effects will probably be of lower stoichiometry than one may
observe in viral infections. Another important difference is that the exosome surface is not dom-
inated by high copy numbers of a single, receptor-binding, fusogenic ENV protein. Rather, each
exosome possesses numerous surface molecules capable of interacting with a series of cognate
receptors/ligands on the plasma and/or endosome membrane of recipient cells. These differences
predict that exosomes are likely to display complex cell-binding kinetics and transmit multiple
signals of variable intensity, and they may in some cases have no physiological impact on the tar-
get cells other than increasing their nutrient level. In short, exosome uptake can be modeled on
viral uptake but only if these differences are taken into account.
Even with these limitations, several studies have identified specific ligand–receptor interac-
tions that can have a significant impact on exosome–cell binding and uptake. These include direct
and indirect binding of exosomes to cells on the basis of their expression of PS receptors, lectins,
glycans, integrins, and other cell adhesion molecules (38, 41, 186, 187). As for how these bind-
ing interactions lead to exosome–cell fusion, multiple mechanisms are possible. For example, the
well-established fact of viral pseudotyping virtually ensures that virus-infected cells will release
exosomes carrying fusogenic, virus-encoded ENV proteins that can direct the delivery of exoso-
mal cargoes into receptor-expressing cells (41). As noted above, the human genome also encodes
at least 19 ERV ENV proteins, and several of these have been shown to possess fusogenic activity
and be incorporated in exosomes (47–49). ERV ENV proteins tend to be expressed in restricted
tissues in adults, but early stage embryos, stem cells, and placental cells express them at elevated

levels, and their expression is also often derepressed in cancers and virus-infected cells. Other
exosomal surface proteins have also been implicated in cell–cell fusion events, such as CD9 and
CD81, though there is as yet no direct evidence that they mediate exosome–cell fusion.
10. BIOLOGICAL ROLES OF EXOSOMES
The biological roles of exosomes span too large a swath of biology for proper treatment in this
article. Nevertheless, we felt it important to at least briefly touch on the facts that exosome biogen-
esis plays important roles in the vesicle-producing cell, that exosomes are part of, and remodel, the
extracellular environment, and that exosomes can transmit signals and molecules to neighboring
cells. We focus here on processes for which the empirical data are robust.
10.1. Cell Autonomous Roles of Exosome Biogenesis
Exosome biogenesis is an elegant mechanism of protein quality control that allows cells to rapidly
and selectively eliminate proteins from the plasma membrane. The most compelling example of
this is the fertilization-induced budding of the sperm receptor Juno from the plasma membrane
of mammalian zygotes, one of the first events in everyone’s life (16). Another example of exosome-
mediated protein quality control includes the developmentally timed elimination of TfR from the
reticulocyte plasma membrane (14, 17). Other similar examples abound in the literature, includ-
ing the exosome-mediated secretion of the cell death mediator MLKL (188), the expulsion of
unshielded and chemically modified RNAs (135, 189), and the vesicular secretion of neurodegen-
erative amyloidogenic proteins and aggregated signaling molecules (39, 40, 165, 190, 191).
In addition to protein quality control, cells use the exosome protein sorting pathway to drive
anterior–posterior cell polarity. This mode of cell polarity is used by the most rapidly migrating
cells, whether they be human leukocytes or protozoan social amoebae, and is established by cells
within minutes of exposure to polarizing stimuli (as opposed to epithelial cell polarity, which de-
velops over a days-to-weeks timescale). Specifically, the exosome biogenesis pathway establishes a
polarized protein sorting pathway that enriches exosomal proteins and lipids at a posterior pole of
amoeboid cells, also known as their uropod (22, 31, 90, 154). Although the molecular mechanisms
involved in polarized sorting of exosome cargoes have yet to be elucidated, their existence allows
leukocytes and other amoeboid cells to rapidly generate the morphological and functional polarity
necessary for rapid, directional cell migration (90).
10.2. Exosomes as Components and Remodelers of the Extracellular Matrix
Once released from the cell, exosomes can become integral components of the ECM. As ECM
components, exosomes provide a mechanism by which cells can manipulate ECM composition
and function. For example, the PS-rich exosome membrane is thought to play a critical role in
seeding hydroxyapatite crystal formation during both normal and pathological modes of osteo-
genesis, a process that is also stimulated by the calcium stored in exosomal annexins and the
phosphate generated by exosomal ATPases, nucleotidases, phosphatases, pyrophosphatases, and
membrane transporters (8, 9). Another example of exosome-mediated ECM modulation involves
tissue factor–containing exosomes, which can serve as templates for thrombus initiation in pro-
cesses ranging from normal wound repair to toxic, paraneoplastic clotting (7, 11, 192). Exosomes
can also serve as templates for producing a wide array of diffusible signaling molecules, such as
adenosine, prostaglandins, PA, and lysophospholipids (1, 66, 127, 158, 193). Other instances of
exosome-mediated ECM modulation include their contribution to the formation, growth, and
spread of amyloid-rich aggregates, plaques, and tangles in neurodegenerative disorders (69, 165,
190).

10.3. Exosome-Mediated Signaling and Molecular Transfer
Much of the recent explosion of exosome research is focused on the roles exosomes play in trans-
mitting signals and molecules via a pathway of intercellular vesicle traffic. As multiplexed signaling
particles, each exosome has the capacity to deliver multiplexed, combinatorial signals through the
engagement and clustering of cognate receptors on the cell surface, and such activities have been
demonstrated for proteins involved in growth factor, cytokine, Wnt, and Notch pathways. Fur-
thermore, fusion of exosomes with target cells has the capability to transmit functional receptors
to target cells, and in some cases even activated receptors and effectors.
That being said, it is altogether reasonable to question whether observations of exosome-
mediated signaling and intercellular traffic are truly important for physiological processes in vivo.
Although in many systems this question is as yet unanswered, in others it has been answered, such
as the clear evidence of exosome-mediated PD-L1 signaling in immunosuppression (55, 194, 195),
exosome-mediated miRNA reprogramming during pregnancy (196) and viral infections (131),and
exosome-mediated transfer of EGFRvIII in cancer (57). Thus, although one should be skeptical
when considering whether exosomes are important for a particular biological process, this skep-
ticism should be tempered by the high likelihood that multicellular life evolved in the context of
constant, never-ending formation and uptake of exosomes. In concluding this section, we would
like to pay tribute to the many observations we were unable to cite or discuss in this forum, includ-
ing the many that show strong evidence that exosomes contribute to (a) a wide array of normal
physiological processes (e.g., development, tissue homeostasis, aging, metabolic regulation, exer-
cise, stress, circadian rhythms, molecular transfer during pregnancy, breastfeeding, eating, para-
sitic interactions, etc.); (b) numerous noninfectious diseases (e.g., cancers, inflammation, metabolic
disorders, autoimmunity, neurodegeneration, chronic pulmonary obstructive disease, addictions,
etc.); and (c) a similarly broad array of infectious diseases (e.g., those caused by infection with
viruses, protozoans, fungi, worms, arthropods, etc.).
11. FUTURE DIRECTIONS
As outlined above, it is becoming increasingly clear that cells generate exosomes across the spec-
trum of plasma and endosome membranes. This view of exosome biogenesis invites investiga-
tion of numerous questions, such as how different cells apportion exosome biogenesis between
their endosome and plasma membranes, regulate the biogenesis and gating of IPMCs in differ-
ent cell types, and establish large, semi-stable, endosome-like domains of plasma membrane, as
these processes are likely to exert a heavy influence on exosome composition and heterogeneity.
Other pressing issues in exosome biogenesis and trafficking include (a) resolving the contribu-
tions of ESCRT proteins and ESCRT function in exosome biogenesis; (b) carefully interrogating
physico-chemical aspects of exosome biogenesis, which may involve both positive and negative
regulators; (c) discovering the molecular mechanism by which high-order oligomerization and
plasma membrane binding target proteins into nascent exosomes; (d) elucidating the proteins and
protein networks involved in exosomal RNA packaging; (e) mapping the flow of exosomes from
different tissues into the various biofluids of the body and into other target tissues; and ( f ) iden-
tifying the mechanisms that mediate functional delivery of bioactive proteins, lipids, and nucleic
acids into target cells. Advances in these areas will likely require new experimental approaches and
technologies that allow for the interrogation of exosome composition at the single-vesicle level as
well as the analysis of exosome biogenesis at the level of single cells. Such advances will accelerate
our understanding of how exosomes contribute to health and disease and allow investigators to
translate this knowledge into exosome-based therapies and diagnostics. Finally, we would like to

point out that the rapidly approaching horizon of single-exosome analyses only serves to heighten
the logical flaw in trying to define subclasses of exosomes based on their supposed site of budding.
At a conceptual level, it is simply impossible to know where any small, secreted vesicle arose after
it has left the cell, and at an empirical level, there is no molecular marker or purification technique
that can definitively separate or identify exosomes that arose by budding via endosomes or the
plasma membrane.
