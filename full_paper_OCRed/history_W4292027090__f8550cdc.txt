Preface 
The preface to a textbook frequently contains the author's justification for 
offering the public "another book" on the given subject. For our chosen 
topic, the arithmetic of elliptic curves, there is little need for such an apologia. 
Considering the vast amount of research currently being done in this area, 
the paucity of introductory texts is somewhat surprising. Parts of the theory 
are contained in various books of Lang (especially [La 3] and [La 5]); and 
there are books of Koblitz ([Kob]) and Robert ([Rob], now out of print) 
which concentrate mostly on the analytic and modular theory. In addition, 
survey articles have been written by Cassels ([Ca 7], really a short book) and 
Tate ([Ta 5J, which is beautifully written, but includes no proofs). Thus the 
author hopes that this volume will fill a real need, both for the serious student 
who wishes to learn the basic facts about the arithmetic of elliptic curves; and 
for the research mathematician who needs a reference source for those same 
basic facts. 
Our approach is more algebraic than that taken in, say, [La 3] or [La 5], 
where many of the basic theorems are derived using complex analytic 
methods and the Lefschetz principle. For this reason, we have had to rely 
somewhat more on techniques from algebraic geometry. However, the geom-
etry of (smooth) curves, which is essentially all that we use, does not require 
a great deal of machinery. And the small price paid in learning a little bit of 
algebraic geometry is amply repaid in a unity of exposition which (to the 
author) seems to be lacking when one makes extensive use of either the 
Lefschetz principle or lengthy (but elementary) calculations with explicit 
polynomial equations. 
This last point is worth amplifying. It has been the author's experience that 
"elementary" proofs requiring page after page of algebra tend to be quite 
uninstructive. A student may be able to verify such a proof, line by line, and

Preface 
at the end will agree that the proof is complete. But little true understanding 
results from such a procedure. In this book, our policy is always to state 
when a result can be proven by such an elementary calculation, indicate 
briefly how that calculation might be done, and then give a more enlighten-
ing proof which is based on general principles. 
The basic (global) theorems in the arithmetic of elliptic curves are the 
Mordell-Weil theorem, which is proven in chapter VIII and analyzed more 
closely in chapter X; and Siegel's theorem, which is proven in chapter IX. The 
reader desiring to reach these results fairly rapidly might take the following 
path: 
I and II (briefly review), III (§1-8), IV (§1-6), V (§1), 
VII (§1-5), VIII (§1-6), IX (§1-7), X (§1-6). 
This material also makes a good one-semester course, possibly with some 
time left at the end for special topics. The present volume is built around the 
notes for such a course, taught by the author at M.I.T. during the spring term 
of 1983. [Of course, there are many other possibilities. For example, one 
might include all of chapters V and VI, skipping IX and (if pressed for time) 
X.] Other important topics in the arithmetic of elliptic curves, which do not 
appear in this volume due to time and space limitations, are briefly discussed 
in appendix C. 
It is certainly true that some of the deepest results in this subject, such as 
Mazur's theorem bounding torsion over Q and Faltings' proof of the isogeny 
conjecture, require many of the resources of modern "SGA-style" algebraic 
geometry. On the other hand, one needs no machinery at all to write down 
the equation of an elliptic curve and to do explicit computations with it; and 
so there are many important theorems whose proof requires nothing more 
than cleverness and hard work. Whether your inclination leans toward 
heavy machinery or imaginative calculations, you will find much that re-
mains to be discovered in the arithmetic theory of elliptic curves. Happy 
hunting! 
Acknowledgments 
In writing this book, I have consulted a great many sources. Citations have 
been included for major theorems, but many results which are now con-
sidered "standard" have been presented as such. In any case, I can claim no 
originality for any of the unlabeled theorems in this book, and apologize 
in advance to anyone who may feel slighted. The excellent survey articles 
of Cassels rCa 7] and Tate [Ta 5] served as guidelines for organizing the 
material. (The reader is especially urged to peruse the latter.) In addition to 
rCa 7] and [Ta 5], other sources which were extensively consulted include 
[La 5], [La 7], [Mum], [Rob], and [Se 10]. 
It would not be possible to catalogue all of the mathematicians from whom

I learned this beautiful subject; but to all of them, my deepest thanks. I would 
especially like to thank John Tate, Barry Mazur, Serge Lang, and the "Ellip-
tic Curves Seminar" group at Harvard (1977-1982), whose help and inspira-
tion set me on the road which led to this book. I would also like to thank 
David Rohrlich and Bill McCallum for their careful reading of the original 
draft, Gary Cornell and the editorial staff of Springer-Verlag for encouraging 
me to undertake this project in the first place, and Ann Clee for her meticu-
lous preparation of the manuscript. Finally, I would like to thank my wife, 
Susan, for her patience and understanding through the turbulent times dur-
ing which this book was written; and also Deborah and Daniel, for providing 
most of the turbulence.
