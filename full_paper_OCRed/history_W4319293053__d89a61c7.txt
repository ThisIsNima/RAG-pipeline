1. INTRODUCTION 
The use of stimulant drugs to decrease fatigue and 
to heighten physical and mental abilities began when 
people first identified plants with these properties. 
For example, in ancient China herbal teas were 
brewed with plants containing ephedrine, and coco 
leaves, the source of cocaine, were chewed in South 
America by the ancestors of the Incas (see ref. 12 for 
an excellent historical review of central nervous sys- 
tem stimulants). Today, stimulant drugs such as the 
amphetamines remain among the most widely used 
and abused of the many psychoactive compounds 
available. Although 
at one time amphetamine 
(AMPH) was prescribed in great numbers, for exam- 
ple as an anorexic in the treatment of obesity, its 
medical use has been greatly curtailed in recent 
years. AMPH is now usually prescribed only for the 
treatment of narcolepsy and childhood hyperkinesis. 
Nevertheless, illicit AMPH is still widely available 
and extensively used for its ability to decrease fa- 
tigue, elevate mood and produce euphoria 96 (AMPH 
will be used to refer collectively to D-, L-, DL- and 
meth-amphetamine). 
However, it is not fully appreciated that AMPH is 
also a potent psychotomimetic. In some schizophren- 
ics it can rapidly intensify psychotic symptoms, and if 
a patient is in remission AMPH may precipitate a 
psychotic episode 265,275. In fact, an AMPH-induced 
exacerbation of symptoms in medicated schizophren- 
ics is predictive of relapse following neuroleptic with- 
drawal 3°5. Perhaps the most dramatic effect of 
AMPH has been described in people who chronically 
use the drug. It has been well documented that non- 
psychotic individuals who repeatedly use AMPH 
sometimes develop a psychosis that is very similar to 
paranoid schizophrenia ~s,32° (for reviews of AMPH 
psychosis see refs. 124, 213, 264, 268, 275). This 
AMPH-induced psychosis usually dissipates upon 
withdrawal from the drug, but former AMPH addicts 
are reported to remain hypersensitive to the psycho- 
tomimetic effects of AMPH even after years of absti- 
nence 248'3°2 (cf. ref. 99). There are also anecdotal re- 
ports that 'physical or psychological stress' can pre- 
cipitate a psychotic episode in 20-25% of former 
AMPH addicts 3°2'3°3. This suggests that chronic 
AMPH use produces a very long-lasting change in 
some neural system(s) involved in the psychotomi- 
metic effects of AMPH. 
These clinical observations generated considera- 
ble interest in the effects of chronic AMPH adminis- 
tration on brain and behavior in non-human animals, 
and in the development of animal models of AMPH- 
induced psychosis. There are now many studies 
showing that chronic AMPH administration has en- 
during consequences for behavior and brain function 
in non-human animals, and one purpose of this paper 
is to review this literature. However, even a cursory 
examination of the literature reveals that at least two 
different paradigms have been used to study the ef- 
fects of chronic AMPH administration. With one 
paradigm, elevated brain concentrations of AMPH 
are maintained for a few days, either by the continu- 
ous administration of AMPH or by multiple repeated 
injections of high doses. The other paradigm involves 
the repeated intermittent administration of AMPH, 
usually by discrete daily injections of relatively low 
doses. Since it will become obvious that these two 
paradigms produce different effects on brain and be- 
havior, studies relevant to each will be reviewed sep- 
arately. 
Continuous AMPH administration produces a syn- 
drome that will be called 'AMPH neurotoxicity'. The 
literature on AMPH neurotoxicity has been re- 
viewed recently (e.g. ref. 81), and therefore will be 
only briefly summarized to provide a comparison 
with the effects of repeated intermittent AMPH ad- 
ministration. The major portion of this paper will fo- 
cus on a phenomenon that will be called 'behavioral 
sensitization', which is produced by repeated inter- 
mittent AMPH administration. In particular, an in- 
depth and critical analysis of hypotheses concerning 
the biological basis of behavioral sensitization is pre- 
sented. In addition, AMPH neurotoxicity and behav-

----- Page 3 (native) -----
ioral sensitization are evaluated as animal models of 
AMPH psychosis. 
The review is confined almost exclusively to stud- 
ies with AMPH, because much more is known about 
AMPH than about other psychomotor stimulants. 
The enduring effects of cocaine have been reviewed 
recently by R.M. Post 213'216. 
2. THE EFFECTS OF CONTINUOUS AMPHETAMINE 
ADMINISTRATION ON BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR (AM- 
PHETAMINE NEUROTOXICITY) 
AMPH addicts often ingest increasing quantities 
of AMPH in 'runs' that can last 3-6 days, during 
which time their behavior becomes increasingly dis- 
organized 165. Since blood levels of AMPH may re- 
main elevated during these 'runs', some investigators 
have continuously administered AMPH to non-hu- 
man animals in an attempt to mimic this pattern of 
drug use. In this context the phrase 'continuous 
AMPH administration' refers to the maintenance of 
elevated blood levels of AMPH for a prolonged peri- 
od of time (usually 3-6 days). This can be achieved in 
one of 3 ways. The first is to implant a silastic pellet 117 
or osmotic pump that slowly and continuously re- 
leases AMPH 19s.229`2sS. The second is by frequent re- 
peated systemic injections of high doses (e.g. refs. 
270, 308, 309), and the third by concomitant treat- 
ment with drugs, such as iprindole, that inhibit the 
metabolism of AMPH 94'2s4. As will be described, all 3 
methods can produce comparable effects on brain 
monoamine systems and behavior. 
The behavioral changes associated with continu- 
ous AMPH administration have been reviewed re- 
cently by Ellison and Eison sl (see also refs. 80, 83, 
199,200, 231). Briefly, in rats there is an initial short 
period of hyperactivity and then almost continuous 
intense stereotypy, followed by a period of inactivity. 
After 4-5 days, what has been described 'hallucina- 
tory-like' behavior appears. The details of this hallu- 
cinatory-like behavior depend on the species, but it is 
similar to that seen after the administration of hallu- 
cinogenic drugs, such as LSD 122'123. In the rat it is 
characterized by 'wet dog' shakes, limb flicks and ex- 
cessive grooming and biting of the skin. This groom- 
ing and biting behavior is also pronounced in mon- 
keys and may 'develop into episodes of parasitotic- 
like picking at the fur, during which the animal danc- 
159 
es about as though stimulated on various parts of the 
skin 'sx (p. 756). This behavior is similar to that re- 
ported to sometimes accompany tactile hallucina- 
tions in AMPH addicts (e.g. ref. 253). 
There are now many studies showing that continu- 
ous AMPH treatment is neurotoxic, and that the ap- 
pearance of hallucinatory-like behavior in non-hu- 
man animals is accompanied by brain damage. It was 
originally thought that hallucinatory-like behavior 
was related to the inactivation of serotonin systems, 
but more recent evidence suggests it may be due to 
alterations in dopaminergic function s5'297. The con- 
tinuous infusion of relatively low doses of D-AMPH 
via pellet implants has a fairly selective effect on the 
nigrostriatal DA system, resulting in a depletion of 
striatal DA and its metabolites, a decrease in striatal 
tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity and a decline in 
the number of striatal DA receptors a2,s3'sS'2°°'229 (for 
review see ref. 81). These effects are presumably due 
to degeneration of striatal DA terminals 77'82'2°3'23°. 
Similar damage to nigrostriatal DA neurons has been 
reported following a single injection of D-AMPH or 
meth-AMPH in rats pretreated with iprindole, a drug 
which inhibits the metabolism of AMPH 94"2°7'284'285, 
or following repeated injections of extremely high 
doses of D-AMPH 2°3,287'3°s. 
There are a number of factors that determine how 
regionally and neurochemically specific the neuro- 
toxic effects of continuous AMPH treatment are, in- 
cluding: (1) the dose of AMPH, (2) the duration of 
AMPH treatment, (3) the species, (4) the age of the 
organism, (5) the type of AMPH used (D-, L-, DL-, or 
meth-AMPH) and (6) prior drug history. For exam- 
ple, Steranka 2s5 studied the effects of infusing D- 
AMPH for various periods of time on striatal DA. He 
gave rats a priming injection of 15 mg/kg of AMPH 
(i.p.), and then continuously infused 1.36 mg/h via an 
osmotic minipump. Six hours of infusion did not de- 
plete striatal DA, 8 h produced a moderate depletion 
and 16 h produced a marked depletion (approx. 
50%). This depletion of striatal DA may be perma- 
nent because it had not recovered 6 months later. In a 
similar study, Ricaurte et al. 229 found that the contin- 
uous infusion of meth-AMPH via an osmotic pump 
(with no 'priming' injection) at a rate of 4 mg/day for 
3 days produced toxic effects in the striatum. Howev- 
er, lower doses, for example, 1 mg/day for 12 days, 2 
mg/day for 6 days or 4 rng/day for 1.5 day, were not

----- Page 4 (native) -----
160 
sufficient to deplete striatal DA. Since the average 
rat in these studies weighed approximately 250 g it 
can be concluded that in the rat AMPH is neurotoxic 
only if approximately 48 mg/kg is continuously ad- 
ministered over 3 days (16 mg/kg/day229), or if 102 
mg/kg is given over 16 h 285. Schuster and Johanson z58 
report that if D-AMPH is given to rats by discrete 
multiple injections a minimum of 12.5 mg/kg (s.c.) 
twice a day for 4 days is required to deplete striatal 
DA. 
Whether D-AMPH is toxic to other monoaminer- 
gic systems depends partly on how extreme the drug 
treatment regimen is. Ridley et al. TM reported that 
vervet monkeys given D-AMPH in increasing doses 
(from 4 to 12 mg/kg/day for 35 days) were depleted of 
norepinephrine (NE), serotonin and DA in the cau- 
date and cortex. In addition, striatal tyrosine hydrox- 
ylase activity was reduced and the turnover of all the 
monoamines decreased. Interestingly, striatal cho- 
line acetyltransferase and glutamine decarboxylase 
activity were normal TM. Cats seem to be especially 
sensitive to the neurotoxic effects of AMPH z9s. For 
example, Levine et al. 179 found that caudate DA was 
'depleted in cats for up to a year after only 3 injections 
of 1, 2 and 4 mg/kg of D-AMPH, with each injection 
separated by 10 days. This is probably due at least in 
part to the much longer half-life of AMPH in cats 
(6.5-8.5 h) than in rats (45-60 min; see ref. 268, 
p. 147 for references). 
Most studies on the neurotoxic effects of AMPH 
have utilized its methylated form. Methampheta- 
mine (meth-AMPH) appears to be more toxic than 
D-AMPH, and more non-selective. There are many 
reports of damage not only to striatal DA neurons 
following 
sustained 
treatment 
with 
meth- 
AMPH 77'113'181'228'270'309, but also to serotonin and 
NE systems, especially in cats 23"113'194'207'228'257'297'299. 
Nevertheless, there is still some selectivity. In adult 
animals the striatum, olfactory tubercle and cortex 
appear to be more sensitive to the toxic effects of 
meth-AMPH than the nucleus accumbens, hypothal- 
amus or median eminence; and cholinergic and gluta- 
minergic systems are not affected (e.g. refs. 23, 194, 
218,228). In immature gerbils frontocortical neurons 
may be especially sensitive 3t°. Prior drug history also 
influences the toxicity of meth-AMPH. For example, 
Schmidt et al. 257 found that pre-exposure to increas- 
ing doses of meth-AMPH provides considerable pro- 
tection against the neurotoxic effects of high doses 
given later, an effect that may be partly due to 
changes in the disposition of meth-AMPH 255. 
The mechanism by which continuous AMPH pro- 
duces its toxic effects is not well understood. One 
possibility is that 6-hydroxydopamine is formed from 
the massive quantities of DA released following high 
doses of meth-AMPH 256'27~. This idea is consistent 
with the observation that the integrity of the DA up- 
take carrier is required for meth-AMPH to have its 
toxic effects on striatal DA neurons TM. 
Although it has been argued here that the different 
treatment paradigms which continuously elevate 
brain levels of AMPH produce comparable effects on 
brain and behavior, it should be remembered that 
they are not identical. For example, the neural 
changes produced by the continuous infusion of low 
doses from a pellet implant are not exactly the same 
as those produced by multiple repeated injections of 
extremely high doses, and even the continuous infu- 
sion with pellets vs pumps may produce slightly dif- 
ferent effects 71. Therefore, there actually may be 
more than one 'AMPH neurotoxicity syndrome'. 
Nevertheless, there is no doubt that the prolonged 
and sustained exposure to AMPH produces progres- 
sive changes in behavior that are associated with 
brain damage. 
The 
repeated 
intermittent 
administration 
of 
AMPH also produces progressive changes in brain 
and behavior, but these are quite distinct from those 
produced by continuous AMPH treatment, and are 
discussed next. 
3. THE BEHAVIORAL CONSEQUENCES OF REPEAT- 
ED INTERMITYENT AMPHETAMINE ADMINISTRA- 
TION (BEHAVIORAL SENSITIZATION) 
Many of the initial studies on the effects of repeat- 
ed AMPH administration were primarily concerned 
with its potent effects on the autonomic nervous sys- 
tem. It was found that with repeated administration, 
rapid tolerance developed to AMPH's autonomic ef- 
fects, including those on body temperature, blood 
pressure, heart rate and respiration. Tolerance to 
AMPH's anorexic effects were also observed (e.g. 
for reviews see refs. 50,164,180). However, the first 
studies on the motor stimulant effects of AMPH were 
equivocal concerning the development of tolerance

----- Page 5 (native) -----
(e.g. refs. 68,262,321; for review see ref. 164). 
In the late 1960s, a re-examination of the effects of 
repeated AMPH treatment was prompted by de- 
scriptions of an evolving syndrome of progressively 
bizarre stereotyped behavior produced by repeated, 
increasing doses of AMPH 73'75'76'79. It soon became 
apparent that there was not merely a lack of toler- 
ance to the motor stimulant effects of AMPH, but 
that the repeated intermittent administration of the 
same dose of AMPH produced a progressive en- 
hancement in many behaviors. In addition, it was 
found that this enhanced sensitivity to AMPH per- 
sisted for very long periods of time following withdra- 
wal from the drug. For example, Magos 185 reported 
that in rats two injections of 6 mg/kg of D-AMPH 
given 2-5 weeks apart enhanced the behavioral ster- 
eotypy produced by a third injection given 4 weeks 
later. This treatment did not change the LDs0 for 
AMPH. Similarly, Wallach and Gershon 3H reported 
that the daily administration of AMPH to rats, cats or 
dogs enhanced the stereotypy produced by a subse- 
quent injection of a lower dose. 
it is now well established that repeated intermit- 
tent injections of AMPH sensitize animals to its ster- 
eotypy-producing effects 152'153"267. Since the early 
1970s there have been many studies on the behavior- 
al consequences of repeated intermittent AMPH ad- 
ministration (for reviews see refs. 17, 157, 158,210, 
216, 264, 268), and these will be summarized here 
only for the purpose of outlining the most salient fea- 
tures of the behavioral phenomenon. The term be- 
havioral sensitization will be used to refer to the pro- 
gressive and enduring enhancement in many AMPH- 
induced behaviors produced by the repeated inter- 
mittent administration of AMPH. Other terms that 
have been used to refer to the same phenomenon in- 
clude reverse tolerance, behavioral augmentation 
and behavioral facilitation. 
3.1. The major characteristics of behavioral sensiti- 
zation 
3.1.1. Behavior 
The behavior produced by AMPH depends on a 
number of factors, including the species and sex of 
the subject, the dose administered and environ- 
mental surroundings. In rats, an acute injection of 
AMPH initially produces an increase in the incidence 
161 
of forward locomotion, head movements, sniffing 
and rearing (i.e., the animal becomes generally hy- 
peractive) and a concomitant decrease in the inci- 
dence of other behaviors, such as grooming z19,251 (for 
reviews see refs. 51, 120). If a low dose of AMPH is 
administered, this general hyperactivity persists for 
the duration of the drug's action. With higher doses 
the initial hyperactivity is soon followed by stereo- 
typed behavior. During the stereotypy phase, loco- 
motion and rearing cease, the animal assumes a 
crouched posture and engages in continuous or near- 
ly continuous repetitive head movements, forelimb 
movements, sniffing, licking or biting. The intensity 
and duration of focused stereotyped behavior in- 
creases with increasing doses of AMPH. 
When a constant dose of AMPH is repeatedly and 
intermittently administered many (but not all) of the 
behaviors described above are progressively en- 
hanced or otherwise altered. For example, in animals 
that have been previously exposed to AMPH, subse- 
quent AMPH treatment produces: (1) more intense 
stereotyped behavior; (2) a reduced time to the onset 
of stereotypy following injection of AMPH; and/or 
(3) the development of stereotyped behavior follow- 
ing administration of a lower dose of AMPH than 
would usually produce stereotypy (e.g. refs. 49, 112, 
146,152,176, 177,185,263,267,316). However, the 
stereotyped behavior produced by AMPH actually 
consists of a complex array of discrete behavioral ele- 
ments, and not all of these show the same pattern of 
sensitization. For example, in rats, sniffing and re- 
petitive head and limb movements show rapid sensiti- 
zation, but oral behaviors (licking and biting) do 
not 69,224. We recently confirmed these findings and 
the results are shown in Fig. 1 to illustrate the typical 
pattern of sensitization to the stereotypy-producing 
effects of AMPH (see also ref. 191). The effects of 
repeated AMPH treatment on oral behaviors may be 
especially complex. Eichler et al. 69 reported that 
daily AMPH injections resulted in the development 
of tolerance to AMPH-induced stereotyped licking 
behavior over the first 21 days of treatment, followed 
by the sensitization of licking behavior over the next 
44 days of treatment. 
The locomotion and rearing produced by low doses 
of AMPH are similarly enhanced with repeated in- 
termittent AMPH administration, but this may also 
result in the emergence of focused stereotypy. After

NUMBER OF AMPHETAMINE INJECTIONS 
(5.0 rng/kg) 
Fig. I. The effects of repeated intermittent injections of am- 
phetamine on stereotyped behavior. Adult female rats (Holtz- 
man) received an i.p. injection of 3.0 mg/kg of o-amphetamine 
sulfate in their home cage once every 3-4 days for a total of 9 
'injections. Stereotyped behavior was rated at 10 and 30 rain fol- 
lowing the injection, and then every 30 min for a total of 150 
rain, following the first, 3rd, 5th and 9th injection. Overall ster- 
eotypy was rated using the scale described by Dougherty and 
Ellinwood 65, and the individual components of stereotyped be- 
havior as described by Rebec and Sega122~. Note the progres- 
sive increase in stereotyped sniffing, repetitive head and limb 
movements and overall stereotypy. In this experiment there 
was no significant change in oral movements (mvts.) over time. 
the emergence of stereotypy the enhanced locomo- 
tion and rearing produced by repeated AMPH treat- 
ment are confined to the initial 'pre-phase' of hyper- 
activity, before the appearance of stereotypy, and 
the later 'after-phase' of hyperactivity, when the ef- 
fects of AMPH are in decline 22'110.176-177.267,273. It 
should be noted that the pattern of locomotion pro- 
duced by AMPH is not normal in all respects, but is 
itself abnormally stereotyped 223,252,264. 
Although there is general agreement that stereo- 
typed behavior and locomotion are augmented by re- 
peated intermittent AMPH treatment, not all re- 
searchers have reported exactly the same profile of 
changes. For example, Segal and his colleagues have 
typically found that the sensitization of stereotyped 
behavior is characterized by a decrease in the latency 
to the onset of stereotypy, and at some doses, more 
intense stereotypy; but not by any change in the du- 
ration of stereotypy (see Segal et al. TM for review). 
On the other hand, Eichler et al. 69 reported that daily 
AMPH treatment produced a progressive increase in 
the duration (and intensity) of stereotyped sniffing. 
Leith and Kuczenski ~77 have shown that it is possible 
to dissociate different components of behavioral sen- 
sitization within the same animal. They found that 
the decreased latency to the onset of stereotypy and 
the enhancement of post-stereotypy locomotor activ- 
ity seen with repeated AMPH developed at different 
rates and persisted for different periods of time. Fur- 
thermore, of 10 different strains of rats, all showed 
the decreased latency to the onset of stereotypy with 
repeated AMPH treatment, but only 5 showed an en- 
hancement in post-stereotypy locomotion 177. Some 
of these differences between studies are probably re- 
lated to procedural differences, and especially to dif- 
ferences in how behavior is quantified. However, as 
pointed out previously 69A77"264, many may be real 
and reflect a multiplicity of neural changes. Obvious- 
ly, it will be important to consider these aspects of be- 
havioral sensitization in trying to relate behavioral 
sensitization to enduring changes in specific neural 
systems. 
Although in most studies of behavioral sensitiza- 
tion, stereotypy or locomotor activity were quanti- 
fied, it should be noted that the repeated administra- 
tion of AMPH sensitizes many other behaviors as 
well. These include: (1) rotational behavior, in either 
animals with unilateral damage to the nigrostriatal 
system or animals without lesions66'67'24°'244; 
(2) 
drinking behavior17-247'294 ; (3) intracranial self-stimu- 
lation217236; (4) acoustic startle behavior156't59; (5) 
cage climbing behavior in micel86; (6) tail pinch- 
induced behaviorlS; and (7) performance in a Y- 
maze TM. In addition, repeated AMPH administra- 
tion has been reported to progressively disrupt meas-

ures of'selective attentfon' and 'latent inhibition' ' 
. 
The sensitizing effects of AMPH do not seem to be 
species-specific. An enduring behavioral sensitiza- 
tion to the repeated intermittent administration of 
AMPH has been reported in every mammalian spe- 
cies studied to date, including: rats, cats, guinea pigs, 
mice, non-human primates and humans (rats 49'112"145'

3.1.2. Injection paradigm 
The paradigm used to administer AMPH is an ex- 
tremely important variable to consider in evaluating 
studies on sensitization (cf. ref. 147). It will be docu- 
mented below that many of the conflicting reports in 
the literature, particularly regarding the neural con- 
sequences of repeated AMPH administration, can be 
traced to the enormous variety of treatment para- 
digms that have been used. 
One variable to be considered is the number of in- 
jections. In most studies of sensitization AMPH is ad- 
ministered (i.p. or s.c.) once or twice daily for 1-2 
weeks. However, there is tremendous variation 
around this 'average'. For example, AMPH has been 
administered for up to 9 months, by injection, or in 
the food or water (e.g.1°9'125'2°5"231; see Table 3 in ref. 
210). But it is not necessary to repeatedly administer 
AMPH for long periods of time to produce behav- 
ioral sensitization_ In fact, one injection is sufficient. 
A single injection of AMPH has been reported to en- 
hance the stereotypy 4°'83'26~, drinking behavior ]7, 
and rotational behavior 67'24°'244 produced by a subse- 
quent injection of AMPH given weeks later. Never- 
theless, the repeated intermittent administration of 
AMPH does produce a progressive enhancement in 
behavior, over-and-above that produced by a single 
injection (e.g. ref, 240). 
A second, and probably even more important vari- 
able, is the interval between AMPH treatments [6'21~. 
To produce robust behavioral sensitization AMPH 
must be given intermittently 64J97'2]~. There is even 
evidence to suggest that injections given relatively 
far apart in time are more efficacious than those 
given more frequently 16'2t~. For example, locomo- 
tion in mice is progressively enhanced to a greater ex- 
tent if 10 injections of meth-AMPH are given 3-4 
days or 7 days apart than if they are administered 
daily ]1°. Similarly, male rats given 1.0 mg/kg of D- 
AMPH once a week for 5 weeks show a greater el- 
evation in rotational behavior than those given 5 in- 
jections once a day for 5 days 24°. In addition, Hitze- 
mann et al.l~2 reported that after 3 weeks of twice 
daily AMPH injections it was necessary to withdraw 
the animals from the drug for more than one day to 
observe behavioral sensitization (i.e., animals with- 
drawn for one day did not show evidence of sensitiza- 
tion, whereas those withdrawn for 7, 14 or 28 days 
did). Similarly, Kolta et al. 161 reported greater be- 
163 
havioral sensitization 15 or 30 days after withdrawal 
from repeated AMPH treatment than after only 3 
days of withdrawal. 
The importance of allowing time between treat- 
ments, presumably for some change in the nervous 
system to develop, has been discussed previously by 
Antelman and Chiodo ]6 and Post 21°'m (although, for 
an incongruent report see ref. 87), These authors 
have suggested that the closer together in time injec- 
tions are given, the more likely tolerance will devel- 
op, and the less likely sensitization will occur. Of 
course, giving injections too close together in time, 
especially when large doses are used, is functionally 
equivalent to continuous administration and will pro- 
duce AMPH neurotoxicity. In order to evaluate re- 
ports of sensitization, it is critical to exclude studies in 
which toxic AMPH injection regimens were used 
(see below). 
Behavioral sensitization has been reported follow- 
ing the repeated administration of both very low 
(<1.0 mg/kf 4°) and very high (10 mg/kg 273) doses of 
AMPH, and therefore this does not seem to be a cru- 
cial variable 2]°. More robust changes may be pro- 
duced by higher doses, but extreme doses are not 
necessary and only increase the risk of producing 
neurotoxic effects. 
3.1.3. Sex differences 
Although most researchers use male animals, fe- 
males show much greater rates of sensitization than 
do males. Robinson et al. 244 first reported that gona- 
dally intact female rats show a greater enhancement 
in rotational behavior following a single injection of 
AMPH than do gonadally intact males. This obser- 
vation was verified and expanded in a later study 
using rats with unilateral 6-OHDA lesions of the sub- 
stantia nigra 24°_ Again, a greater enhancement in 
AMPH-induced rotational behavior was found in fe- 
male than in male rats after either a single injection 
or repeated intermittent injections of AMPH. The 
sex difference in sensitization to AMPH is not unique 
to rotational behavior. Unpublished studies in this 
laboratory by D.M. Camp 43 have revealed similar 
sex differences in the sensitization of stereotyped be- 
havior and locomotion (see also ref. 213). 
Sex differences in behavioral sensitization may be 
due to the influence of endogenous gonadal hor- 
mones on this form of neuroplasticity. Ovariecto-

164 
mized (OVX) and gonadally intact female rats sensi- 
tize at a comparable rate. However, castrated male 
rats show increased rates of sensitization relative to 
gonadally intact males, and are comparable to fe- 
males in this respect 43'24°'244. The lower rate of sensi- 
tization in gonadally intact males may therefore be 
due to the suppression of sensitization by a testicular 
hormone. Of course, testicular hormones could influ- 
ence sensitization indirectly, perhaps by their action 
on the pituitary. There is evidence that at least one 
pituitary hormone (vasopressin) can modulate the 
sensitization to cocaine 214. 
3.1.4. Summary 
In summary, the most salient features of behavior- 
al sensitization include the following: (1) Behavioral 
sensitization can be produced by a single injection of 
a relatively low dose of AMPH. (2) Behavioral sensi- 
tization is greater after multiple intermittent injec- 
tions (as opposed to continuous treatment) than after 
a single injection. (3) Behavioral sensitization per- 
sists for months following withdrawal from AMPH. 
.(4) Behavioral sensitization is greater in females than 
in males, and greater in castrated males than intact 
males. 
4. BEHAVIORAL SENSITIZATION AND AMPHETA- 
MINE NEUROTOXICITY AS ANIMAL MODELS OF AM- 
PHETAMINE PSYCHOSIS 
Much of the interest in the effects of chronic 
AMPH treatment in non-human animals is because 
AMPH is commonly abused by humans, and because 
chronic AMPH use can produce a psychosis similar to 
paranoid schizophrenia 4s. It is therefore important to 
discuss the fact that two completely different syn- 
dromes, behavioral sensitization and AMPH neuro- 
toxicity, have been proposed as animal models of 
AMPH psychosis (e.g. refs. 81, 264, 268). As de- 
scribed above, behavioral sensitization and AMPH 
neurotoxicity are produced by different treatment 
regimens and have different effects on behavior. 
They also have different long-term effects on the ner- 
vous system. (This latter point will be dealt with in 
detail in the next section of this review.) For exam- 
ple, continuous AMPH administration, which pro- 
duces the AMPH neurotoxicity syndrome, destroys 
striatal DA terminals and depletes striatal DA (see 
above for references). The repeated intermittent ad- 
ministration of AMPH produces behavioral sensiti- 
zation, does not deplete DA, but enhances DA re- 
lease (see below). It is obvious that behavioral sensi- 
tization and AMPH neurotoxicity cannot both be 
'animal models' of the same thing, i.e., AMPH psy- 
chosis. Unfortunately, there is no single piece of evi- 
dence that clearly establishes one or the other syn- 
drome as the more valid animal model of AMPH psy- 
chosis. However, it is argued below that the weight of 
the evidence supports the idea that the phenomenon 
of behavioral sensitization provides a reasonably 
good model of AMPH psychosis, but that the AMPH 
neurotoxicity syndrome does not. Arguments against 
the AMPH neurotoxicity syndrome as a model of 
AMPH psychosis are given first. 
(1) The main reason neurotoxic AMPH treatment 
regimens have been used to model AMPH psychosis 
is because it has been suggested this more closely 
mimics the conditions that result in AMPH psycho- 
sis 81. This idea comes mainly from the observation 
that many AMPH addicts, who present at hospital 
emergency wards with psychotic symptoms, have 
taken large quantities of AMPH, usually in 'runs' 
lasting a few days 74'165. Although this is true, it does 
not follow that extremely large doses of AMPH are 
necessary to produce AMPH psychosis. It may be 
misleading to rely on doses used by hard-core 'speed 
freaks' to estimate the dose required to produce 
AMPH psychosis. People using smaller quantities of 
AMPH may also develop psychotic symptoms, but 
because they would be less likely to turn up in hospi- 
tal emergency wards, their symptoms would proba- 
bly go undiagnosed. Angrist and Gershon 11 describe 
such a case (see also ref. 1). In fact, there is consider- 
able evidence in the clinical literature which suggests 
that large doses of AMPH are not necessary to pro- 
duce AMPH psychosis 2~'268. 
A brief and selective review of studies in which 
psychotic symptoms were produced in non-schizo- 
phrenic subjects following the administration of rela- 
tively low known doses of AMPH follows (see also 
ref. 264). Griffith et al. 1°° administered 10 mg of D- 
AMPH i.v., and then 5-10 mg orally each hour until 
psychotic symptoms appeared. Six subjects devel- 
oped an AMPH psychosis within 1-4 days following 
a total of 120-375 mg of AMPH. Two subjects devel- 
oped symptoms within one day, two within 2.5-2.75

----- Page 9 (native) -----
days and two within 4 days. For the sake of estimat- 
ing the dose relative to body weight, let us assume the 
subjects weighed around 65 kg, on average. Using 
the 65 kg figure, it is estimated that the subjects in the 
Griffith et al. l°° study showed psychotic symptoms 
after a total cumulative dose of 1.8-5.8 mg/kg. If cal- 
culated on a mg/kg/day basis, on the order of 3.1-6.2 
mg/kg/day was required to produce psychotic symp- 
toms. Bell 32 obtained similar results. Bell 32 infused 
meth-AMPH in divided doses over 60-75 min. His 
subjects showed psychotic symptoms following a to- 
tal of 50-640 mg. The 640 mg dose was unusually 
high, as the subject requiring the next highest dose to 
produce psychosis showed symptoms after only 260 
mg. Again, assuming an average weight of 65 kg, 
psychotic symptoms were produced after only 
0.8-4.0 mg/kg over 1 h. Similarly, Sato et al. 24s re- 
cently reported that 30-90 mg over 1-6 days 
(0.5-1.4 mg/kg, assuming a 65 kg b. wt.) was suffi- 
cient to produce AMPH psychosis. Sega1264'26s has 
compiled a Table listing 13 different reports of 
AMPH psychosis following doses of less than 100 mg 
of AMPH (see also ref. 99). It is clear from this Table 
that there are many cases in which the daily adminis- 
tration of only 0.3-1.2 mg/kg of AMPH produced 
AMPH psychosis (assuming an average weight of 65 
kg). In addition, it is supposedly common for narco- 
leptics being treated with low doses of AMPH to de- 
velop paranoid tendencies (S. Watson, personal 
communication and ref. 320). 
Although there are clearly problems in making do- 
se-response comparisons across species, and caution 
is required in doing so, the available evidence sug- 
gests the dose required to produce AMPH neurotox- 
icity is many times higher than that required to pro- 
duce AMPH psychosis. Studies by Ricaurte et al. 229 
and Steranka 2s5 in rats suggest that it is necessary to 
administer approximately 48 mg/kg of AMPH con- 
tinuously over 3 days, or 102 mg/kg over 16 h to pro- 
duce neurotoxic effects. Schuster and Johanson 25s re- 
port that, if given twice daily, 25 mg/kg/day for 4 days 
is required to produce neurotoxicity. Furthermore, if 
animals are initially exposed to low doses of AMPH 
(as is usually the case with addicts), even much high- 
er doses than this would be required to produce neu- 
rotoxicity, because of the protective effect of pre-ex- 
posure to low doses 257. Therefore, on the order of at 
least 25-50 mg/kg of AMPH must be administered 
165 
over 3-4 days to produce AMPH neurotoxicity in 
rats, In striking contrast, AMPH psychosis can be 
produced by as little as 0.5-2.0 mg/kg/day, that is, 
with doses at least 12.5-50 times less than those that 
are toxic in rats. 
(2) A prediction that follows from the idea that the 
AMPH neurotoxicity syndrome models the changes 
in brain and behavior associated with AMPH psycho- 
sis, is that people who have experienced AMPH psy- 
chosis should show signs of degenerative changes in 
brain DA systems. Unfortunately, we know of no ev- 
idence available on dopaminergic function in such 
people. It has been reported that AMPH psychosis is 
accompanied by increased cerebral blood flow, es- 
pecially in the anterior frontal lobes 33. However, it is 
not clear if this is consistent with damage in this re- 
gion or not. To resolve the issue, PET studies or stud- 
ies on DA metabolite levels in the CSF of former 
AMPH addicts would be extremely valuable (cf. ref. 
218). 
(3) The idea that a paranoid psychosis is due to de- 
creased dopaminergic activity runs counter to nearly 
all the available evidence on the neurobiology of 
schizophrenia. There is considerable evidence that 
paranoid schizophrenia is not accompanied by DA 
depletion, and most current theories stress the idea 
that DA systems are hyperactive in schizophre- 
nia5S,306. 
(4) One salient characteristic of AMPH psychosis 
is that it typically appears only during the time an in- 
dividual is on the drug and dissipates following with- 
drawal from the drug. But the depletion of brain 
monoamines produced by toxic doses of AMPH ap- 
pears to be permanent, and certainly is present fol- 
lowing withdrawal from AMPH (see above for refer- 
ences). If the depletion of brain monoamines were 
causally related to AMPH psychosis it might be ex- 
pected that the psychosis would also persist following 
withdrawal from the drug; but it does not. Of course, 
it might be argued that presynaptic compensatory 
processes mask the 'depletion-induced psychosis'. 
(5) Lastly, it is well documented that former 
AMPH addicts show an enduring hypersensitivity to 
AMPH 24s'264,26s, and the AMPH neurotoxicity syn- 
drome does not account for this important feature of 
AMPH psychosis. Animals given toxic doses of 
AMPH, then withdrawn from AMPH and later chal- 
lenged with an acute injection are not hypersensitive

----- Page 10 (native) -----
166 
to AMPH (e.g. ref. 197). That is, the AMPH neuro- 
toxicity syndrome is not accompanied by an enduring 
hypersensitivity to AMPH. This is not surprising, be- 
cause the DA depletion produced by toxic doses of 
AMPH (around 30-70%) is not sufficient to produce 
postsynaptic DA receptor supersensitivity. This 
usually requires a greater DA depletion, on the order 
of 85-90% (e.g. refs. 54, 190,288). 
It is concluded, therefore, that the changes in brain 
and behavior produced by neurotoxic AMPH treat- 
ment regimens in non-human animals do not provide 
a good model of AMPH psychosis (see also refs. 204, 
231,264). It is more likely that the neurotoxic effects 
of AMPH are related to the toxicity produced by 
structurally similar compounds, such as p-chloroam- 
phetamine or MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-l,2,3,6-te- 
trahydropyridine), and as such may represent a mod- 
el of presymptomatic Parkinson's disease (e.g. ref. 
93). 
Next, how well behavioral sensitization models 
AMPH psychos~s will be addressed. Schiorring 253 
(p. 115) has suggested that the basic requirements for 
a 'model' of schizophrenia or AMPH psychosis are: 
'(1) Lsimilarities in behavioral disorders'; (2) 'a sus- 
tained course of changes', i.e., progressive changes 
in brain and behavior; (3) 'liability to exacerbation', 
i.e., an enduring hypersensitivity to AMPH; and (4) 
the 'absence of gross morphological lesions in the 
brain'. The phenomenon of behavioral sensitization 
produced by the repeated intermittent administra- 
tion of AMPH meets all of these requirements. 
(1) 'Similarities in behavioral disorders'. Obvious- 
ly, it is impossible to determine if non-human animals 
experience cognitive abnormalities comparable to 
those described in people repeatedly exposed to 
AMPH. However, it is possible to compare the ef- 
fects of AMPH on motor behavior, and striking simi- 
larities have been found 196"219'220'253. Indeed, the de- 
scriptions of AMPH-induced stereotyped activities 
shown by human and non-human animals are some- 
times eerie in their remarkable similarity 253. In hu- 
mans AMPH-induced changes in behavior include: 
"(1) stereotyped, bizarre movements of arms, hands, 
legs; continuous chewing on the tongue or lips; lick- 
ing on the lips; nail-biting; plus other kinds of aimless 
activities such as walking up and down the streets 
without any goal; walking in circles; standing immo- 
bile for several hours; 'pottering', 'punding' with var- 
ious objects, including own body; repetition of single 
words or phrases; stereotyped writing and/or draw- 
ing. (2) Social stereotypies: prolonged sexual inter- 
course without ejaculation. Collective monologues 
(talking without listening). (3) Social withdrawal 
('autism', social isolation). (4) Paranoia. (5) Halluci- 
nations and illusions; auditory, visual, tactile, olfac- 
tory. (6) Micro-hallucinations (worms, insects, etc., 
coming out of the skin) ''253 (p. 114). Sega1264 has com- 
mented extensively on the similarities in the increas- 
ingly perseverative and restricted behavior patterns 
seen in both human and non-human animals repeat- 
edly exposed to AMPH. Although more speculative, 
Solomon and his colleagues 56'277 have also attempted 
to relate progressive alterations in attentional proc- 
esses produced by repeated AMPH treatment in rats, 
to theoretically similar deficits in schizophrenics. 
(2) 'A sustained course of changes'. The progres- 
sive development of increasingly stereotyped behav- 
ior with repeated intermittent injections of AMPH 
has been thoroughly documented, and was described 
in detail above. In a similar fashion, the probability 
of producing the cognitive abnormalities associated 
with AMPH psychosis in people is thought to in- 
crease with repeated exposure to the drug 79. Howev- 
er, it should be noted that AMPH psychosis has been 
reported 
following 
the 
first 
exposure 
to 
AMPH 99'219"265, just as an appropriate acute dose of 
AMPH can produce stereotypy in rats. Nevertheless, 
with the repeated intermittent administration of 
AMPH, 
and the development of sensitization, 
AMPH becomes progressively more potent in pro- 
ducing stereotyped behavior and psychosis. 
(3) 'Liability to exacerbation'. The enduring na- 
ture of the changes in brain and behavior produced 
by repeated intermittent AMPH treatment is one of 
the most intriguing aspects of sensitization. Both hu- 
man and non-human animals that have been pre- 
viously exposed to AMPH remain hypersensitive to 
the drug for very long periods of time. Former 
AMPH addicts have been reported to be hypersensi- 
tive to the psychotomimetic effects of AMPH even 
after years of abstinence 24a'3°2, and animals sensi- 
tized to AMPH remain hypersensitive to the motor 
stimulant effects of AMPH for at least months, and 
perhaps much longer 185'24°. 
(4) 'Absence of gross morphological lesions'. 
There is no doubt that robust behavioral sensitization

----- Page 11 (native) -----
can be produced by the repeated intermittent admin- 
istration of AMPH in doses that do not produce brain 
damage, as will be documented in the following sec- 
tion. In fact, it will be argued below that if an AMPH 
treatment paradigm damages DA neurons this con- 
stitutes prima facie evidence for AMPH neurotoxici- 
ty, not behavioral sensitization. 
5. THE BIOLOGICAL BASIS OF BEHAVIORAL SENSI- 
TIZATION 
It is clear that the repeated intermittent adminis- 
tration of AMPH produces very long-lasting changes 
in behavior, and there has been a great deal of inter- 
est in how this occurs. An understanding of how stim- 
ulant drugs produce enduring behavioral changes 
may provide insight into how they produce their psy- 
chotomimetic effects, and thus into the neurobiology 
of psychosis. But regardless of whether behavioral 
sensitization is analogous to AMPH psychosis, it is 
important to determine how such a short-term altera- 
tion in neural function can produce such long-lasting 
consequences. A number of hypotheses have been 
entertained, and these can be divided into 3 catego- 
ries: (1) drug dispositional or peripheral hypotheses; 
(2) drug-environment conditioning hypotheses; and 
(3) neural hypotheses. Each of these hypotheses will 
be evaluated in turn, taking into consideration the 
characteristics of behavioral sensitization summa- 
rized above. 
5.1. Drug dispositional/peripheral hypotheses 
It is possible that the increasing behavioral re- 
sponse produced by repeated AMPH administration 
is due to some change in the disposition of AMPH. 
For example, AMPH pretreatment may increase the 
amount of AMPH that reaches the brain due to 
changes in AMPH metabolism, or because AMPH 
accumulates in adipose tissue and is released lat- 
er 255'2s°. In support of a dispositional hypothesis, 
Kuhn and Schanberg 17° reported that AMPH pre- 
treatment increased the rate of AMPH uptake into 
the brain (at 10 min), although it did not influence its 
rate of removal from the brain (at 1, 4 and 12 h). It 
should be noted, however, that Kuhn and Schan- 
berg 17° administered AMPH daily, increasing the 
dose by 1 mg/kg each day from 10 to 32 mg/kg. They 
167 
mention in their paper that the changes in AMPH up- 
take they found could be due to the loss of body fat or 
decreased metabolism of AMPH resulting from liver 
damage associated with these extremely high doses 
of AMPH. 
Further examination of the literature reveals little 
support for any simple dispositional/peripheral hy- 
pothesis, as noted in a number of recent pa- 
pers 62A69'210'264. For example, it has been reported 
that chronic AMPH treatment with lower doses does 
not alter whole brain or regional brain (e.g. striatum, 
cortex, olfactory tubercle) levels of AMPH 37,6°' 
~27,312. There is certainly no evidence that the behav- 
ioral sensitization produced by a single injection, or 
intermittent injections of relatively small doses of 
AMPH is accompanied by changes in the uptake of 
AMPH into the brain. 
It has also been suggested that the formation and 
retention of the major metabolites of AMPH, p-hy- 
droxyamphetamine (pOHA) and p-hydroxynore- 
phedrine (pOHE), could contribute to either the tol- 
erance or sensitization produced by repeated AMPH 
administration 6°. However, there is very little experi- 
mental support for this idea (see ref. 62 for review). 
For example, some authors have reported that 
AMPH pretreatment does not alter the formation of 
pOHA or pOHE ~7°. More importantly, these metab- 
olites are not formed after the administration of L- 
AMPH or methylphenidate, but repeated injections 
of these drugs do produce behavioral sensitiza- 
tion 4°'316. In addition, guinea pigs do not form pOHE 
from D-AMPH, but still show behavioral sensitiza- 
tion 272. Lastly, as noted by Lewander ~s°, it is difficult 
to imagine how dispositional/peripheral factors could 
account for the development of tolerance to some of 
the effects of AMPH (e_g. autonomic effects) simul- 
taneously with the sensitization of others (e.g. ster- 
eotyped head movements, rotational behavior). 
In conclusion, there is a general consensus that dis- 
positional]peripheral factors cannot account for the 
behavioral sensitization produced by repeated inter- 
mittent injections of low doses of AMPH 62'169'210'264. 
5.2. Drug-environment conditioning hypotheses 
When the administration of a psychoactive drug is 
repeatedly paired with a unique test environment, 
the test environment can sometimes acquire the

----- Page 12 (native) -----
168 
properties of a conditioned stimulus (CS). In this sit- 
uation, behavior previously elicited only by the drug 
(the unconditioned stimulus) is eventually elicited by 
the environment (the CS) in the absence of the 
drug 182"292. Psychomotor stimulant drugs, including 
AMPH, are subject to this kind of drug-environment 
conditioning. It has been suggested, therefore, that 
drug-environment conditioning may be at least par- 
tially responsible for the development of behavioral 
sensitization72,110,209,2t5,226,250,293. 
The 
important 
question here is not whether the behavioral effects of 
AMPH can be conditioned, because there is no doubt 
they can, but whether drug-environment condition- 
ing is necessary for behavioral sensitization. That is, 
can drug-environment conditioning alone account 
for the characteristics of behavioral sensitization? A 
review of the literature reveals that it cannot, as illus- 
trated by the following points. 
(1) Sega1263 has previously argued that drug-envir- 
onment conditioning cannot account for behavioral 
sensitization. For drug-environment conditioning to 
occur it is necessary to pair drug administration with 
a unique test environment 25°'293. However, in all 
their studies on sensitization, Segal and his col- 
leagues minimized conditioning variables by housing 
animals continuously in the 'test' chambers. They 
found that under these conditions the repeated ad- 
ministration of AMPH still p~roduces sensitiza- 
tion 4°'263'264'267. Similar results have been obtained in 
this lab. For example, the data illustrated in Fig. 1 
were obtained from rats that were always adminis- 
tered AMPH in their home (wire-hanging) cages, not 
in a unique test environment. 
(2) Segal and his colleagues have also shown that it 
is not necessary to treat animals with AMPH in the 
test environment to produce sensitization 4°. Browne 
and Segal 4° pretreated rats with 2.5 mg/kg of AMPH 
or saline daily for 4 days in one of 3 different environ- 
ments: (a) the test chamber, (b) a plastic cage, singly 
housed, or (c) a plastic cage, group housed. On the 
5th day, all rats received 2.5 mg/kg of AMPH in the 
test chambers. All 3 groups pretreated with AMPH 
(regardless of environment) showed sensitization, as 
indicated by a more rapid onset of stereotypy relative 
to saline-pretreated control animals. Similar findings 
have been obtained in other studies where rotational 
behavior, stereotypy or locomotion were meas- 
ured 43'67'240. For example, Robinson z4° compared 
AMPH-induced rotational behavior in 3 different 
groups of rats, all of which had a unilateral 6-OHDA 
lesion of the substantia nigra. One group (sensitized) 
was given AMPH in the rotometers (the unique en- 
vironment), and a second group saline in the rotome- 
ters weekly for 3 weeks. During the first 3 weekly test 
sessions, a third group (pseudoconditioned) received 
saline in the rotometers, and AMPH in their home 
cages following removal from the rotometer. On the 
4th week, all rats received 3.0 mg/kg of AMPH in the 
rotometers and rotational behavior was recorded. 
Both of the AMPH pretreated groups showed great- 
er AMPH-induced rotational behavior during the 4th 
test session than did saline pretreated rats. The sa- 
line pretreated rats made the same number of rota- 
tions as the sensitized animals the first time sensitized 
animals received AMPH in the rotometers. These 
studies establish that it is not necessary to pair 
AMPH administration with a unique test environ- 
ment to produce sensitization 4°,24°. 
(3) The evidence discussed thus far does not sup- 
port a drug-environment conditioning hypothesis, 
but it is still possible that some form of interoceptive 
conditioning is involved. However, this idea is not 
supported by studies showing that under appropriate 
experimental conditions, a saline injection fails to 
mimic the locomotor and stereotypy producing ef- 
fects of AMPH in sensitized animals 43'263"267, and 
weekly injections of AMPH do not produce condi- 
tioned rotational behavior 24°. 
(4) A further argument against conditioning hy- 
potheses has been raised by Sega1263. He pointed out 
that when rats are repeatedly administered a low 
dose of AMPH, which initially produces only loco- 
motion, that dose eventually comes to elicit stereo- 
typy_ That is, the pattern and character of the behav- 
ior elicited by the drug evolves from that associated 
with a low dose to that associated with a higher dose 
of the drug. This is not consistent with a conditioning 
hypothesis, because if locomotion were being condi- 
tioned to the test environment one would expect to 
observe conditioned locomotion; not the appearance 
of a new behavior 263. 
(5) Lastly, there have now been many reports that 
a single injection of AMPH can produce a very long- 
lasting enhancement in a variety of AMPH-induced 
behaviors 4°'24°'244'264. It is difficult to imagine that 
conditioning could account for these enduring effects

of one exposure to AMPH, since most conditioning 
phenomena require repeated pairing of the CS and 
UCS. Furthermore, as pointed out by one of the 
anonymous reviewers of this paper, 'sensitized re- 
sponses grow with the passage of time . . . whereas 
conditioned 
responses 
should 
decline 
with 
time,16,17,161. 
The conclusion to be drawn from the evidence just 
summarized is clear; drug-environment conditioning 
cannot fully account for behavioral sensitization. It 
needs to be emphasized, however, that even though 
drug-environment conditioning does not explain be- 
havioral sensitization, it is probably a major factor in- 
fluencing many studies of behavioral sensitization. If 
animals are repeatedly and frequently tested in a 
unique environment, it is very likely that drug-envir- 
onment conditioning will occur 110'215'250'293. 
It is 
therefore difficult to interpret and evaluate studies of 
behavioral sensitization that are confounded by con- 
ditioning variables because the extent to which 
changes in behavior can be attributed to sensitization 
vs conditioning is unclear. It is probable that some of 
the apparent discrepancies in the literature are due to 
differences in the extent to which conditioning varia- 
bles predominate in any particular study (see below). 
Nevertheless, neither drug-dispositionai nor condi- 
tioning hypotheses can fully explain behavioral sensi- 
tization, and so other hypotheses must be enter- 
tained. 
5.3. Neural hypotheses 
It has been suggested that the repeated intermit- 
tent administration of AMPH causes a long-lasting 
change in neural systems that mediate the motor 
stimulant effects of AMPH, and that this is responsi- 
ble for the heightened behavioral response seen upon 
subsequent exposure to the drug 152'186'267. The idea 
that a central change is involved is supported by the 
observation that rats given repeated systemic injec- 
tions of AMPH are hypersensitive to the locomotor- 
enhancing effects of a subsequent intraventricular in- 
jection of AMPH 225. Research on the neural corre- 
lates of behavioral sensitization has addressed two 
basic questions: 
(1) what is the locus of the 
change(s), and (2) what is the nature of the 
change(s)? Because of the character of this research, 
the locus of change is largely defined in terms of spe- 
169 
cific neurotransmitter systems. Most researchers 
have studied brain DA systems, and so evidence for 
changes in nigrostriatal, mesolimbic and mesocorti- 
cal DA systems will be reviewed first. There is only 
limited evidence that behavioral sensitization is ac- 
companied by changes in other neurotransmitter sys- 
tems, and so this will be reviewed second. Since the 
literature is large and there are multiple hypotheses 
as to the nature of neural changes, studies proposing 
a primarily postsynaptic vs presynaptic basis to sensi- 
tization will be dealt with separately. 
5.3.1. The nigrostriatal dopamine system 
Most attempts to identify a neural correlate of be- 
havioral sensitization have focused on the nigrostria- 
tal DA system. This is to be expected because AMPH 
causes striatal DA release ~92, and many of the behav- 
iors that are sensitized by AMPH (e.g. stereotypy, 
rotation) are thought to be caused by the release of 
DA from nigrostriatal neurons 51"119"192'193'300. 
5.3.1.1. Evidence for postsynaptic changes. In one 
of the earliest papers on behavioral sensitization Kla- 
wans and Margolin L52 proposed that the repeated ad- 
ministration of AMPH produces postsynaptic DA re- 
ceptor supersensitivity. They based this idea on an 
experiment showing that guinea pigs sensitized to 
AMPH were also hypersensitive to apomorphine 
(APO), a direct-acting DA receptor agonist. In a lat- 
er paper they provided neurochemical evidence for 
striatal DA receptor supersensitivity in AMPH-pre- 
treated guinea pigs TM. 
Further studies to examine the hypothesis that 
postsynaptic DA receptors are supersensitive in 
AMPH-sensitized animals have largely utilized one 
of two approaches. (1) If AMPH-pretreated animals 
have supersensitive postsynaptic DA receptors they 
should be hypersensitive to the behavioral effects of 
direct-acting DA receptor agonists, as reported by 
Klawans and Margolin 152. However, these data are 
equivocal. Table I shows that in the majority (12 out 
of 20) of studies of this type (albeit a small majority) 
it was found that AMPH-pretreated animals are not 
hypersensitive to APO. 
(2) The second approach has been to study DA re- 
ceptor binding. However, studies on DA receptor 
binding do not support the contention that striatal 
postsynaptic DA receptors are up-regulated in 
AMPH-sensitized animals; and in fact, most of these

studies report that in AMPH-pretreated 
animals 
there is either a decrease in DA receptor binding, or 
no change (Table II). In only 4 of the 24 experiments 
summarized in Table II were AMPH-pretreated 
ani- 
mals found to have increased DA receptor binding. 
These 4 reports differ somewhat from the rest in that 
in 3 of them [3H]DA or [3H]ADTN were used as the 
ligand. In contrast, [3H]spiroperidol was used in most 
studies reporting a decrease or no change in binding. 
Furthermore, the Klawans et a1.154 study is unusual 
because 
they reported 
an increased 
affinity for 
[3H]DA at 'high affinity' sites with no change in Bmax, 
but an increase in the number of receptors at 'low af- 
finity' sites (see also ref. 98). This is difficult to inter- 
pret. The only report of increased [3H]spiroperidol 
binding is an abstract by Robertson 238, but in two 
subsequent 
papers Robertson 237'239 reports 
a de- 
crease in striatal [3H]spiroperidol binding in AMPH- 
pretreated rats. Attempts to identify changes in DA- 
stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in sensitized an- 
imals have also been negative 7'H~,114,115. 
In conclusion, the idea that behavioral sensitiza- 
tion is due to hypersensitive striatal postsynaptic DA 
receptors is not supported by most of the available 
evidence. In fact, much of the evidence suggests the 
opposite, that is, a small down-regulation of postsyn- 
aptic DA receptors in AMPH-pretreated 
animals. 
The idea that postsynaptic DA receptors are actually 
hyposensitive in AMPH-pretreated 
animals is fur- 
ther supported by a recent electrophysioiogical ex- 
periment by Kamata and Rebec 136 (see also refs. 8, 
295), who found that the ability of iontophoretically 
applied DA to inhibit glutamate-induced striatai unit 
activity was reduced in AMPH-pretreated rats.

Since the weight of the evidence is strongly against 
the DA postsynaptic receptor supersensitivity hy- 
pothesis, it is curious that there are so many studies in 
which 'cross-sensitization' to APO was found (Table 
I). It is not clear what differentiates the studies in 
which cross-sensitization to APO was found from 
those in which it was not. The most obvious varia- 
bles, such as treatment regimen or withdrawal peri- 
od, do not account for the discrepancies. One hy- 
pothesis, that unfortunately is impossible to test post- 
hoc, is that apparent cross-sensitization to APO is ac- 
tually due to drug-environment conditioning effects. 
It is known that AMPH can act as an unconditioned 
stimulus, such that after the repeated pairing of 
AMPH with a unique test environment even an injec- 
tion of saline will produce many of the behaviors pre- 
viously associated with only AMPH administration 
(see above for references). It is therefore possible 
that the enhanced behavioral response to APO that is 
sometimes observed in AMPH-pretreated animals is 
due to drug-environment conditioning, and not to an 
up-regulation of postsynaptic striatal DA receptors. 
It should also be noted briefly that there have been 
no studies of striatal DA receptor binding in animals 
treated with a relatively conservative AMPH injec- 
tion regimen (for example, every 4-7 days for a total 
of 5-10 injections), and then withdrawn for longer 
than 7 days. Therefore, despite the many studies on

----- Page 16 (native) -----
172 
DA receptor binding shown in Table II, it is not 
known whether the behavioral sensitization pro- 
duced by intermittent injections of AMPH is consis- 
tently accompanied by a small down-regulation, or 
any other change in DA binding. 
5.3.1.2. Evidence for presynaptic changes. Upon 
cursory examination the evidence for presynaptic 
changes in the nigrostriatal DA system of sensitized 
animals appears to be contradictory and confusing. 
But much of this confusion is because different 
AMPH treatment regimens produce different effects 
on presynaptic indices of DA function. As discussed 
above, AMPH is neurotoxic if elevated brain concen- 
trations are sustained for very long, either by contin- 
uous administration or frequent multiple injections 
of high doses. AMPH neurotoxicity is manifested by 
many presynaptic histopathological and neurochem- 
ical changes, including degeneration of nigrostriatal 
DA terminals and striatal DA depletion. However, it 
will be shown below that robust behavioral sensitiza- 
tion can be produced by a regimen of repeated inter- 
mittent AMPH injections that does not result in DA 
depletion secondary to degeneration of striatal DA 
.terminals. Furthermore, 
behavioral sensitization 
persists for months following the withdrawal of 
AMPH, in the absence of damage to nigrostriatal 
DA neurons. Therefore, to realistically evaluate 
whether behavioral sensitization is accompanied by 
changes in presynaptic striatal DA function it is im- 
perative to exclude studies in which the AMPH treat- 
ment regimen may have been neurotoxic, and where 
measures were made without having withdrawn ani- 
mals from the drug. Otherwise, the neurotoxic ef- 
fects of AMPH, or the well known presynaptic com- 
pensatory responses that occur following partial 
damage to dopaminergic systems 3A°4'288, could easily 
be mistaken for neural correlates of behavioral sensi- 
tization. 
It is sometimes difficult to determine from a paper 
whether the AMPH treatment regimen used was 
neurotoxic. Some multiple injection regimens may 
produce a mix of toxic and sensitization effects. To 
avoid mistaking the neural correlates of behavioral 
sensitization with those associated with AMPH neu- 
rotoxicity, studies were excluded from the following 
analysis if: (1) AMPH was given more than two times 
per day; (2) animals were withdrawn from AMPH for 
less than one day; or (3) there was clear evidence 
of AMPH neurotoxicity (as indicated by the use of 
high doses of AMPH with accompanying DA deple- 
tion). Studies on the effects of chronic AMPH admin- 
istration that were excluded on the basis of these cri- 
teria include refs.: 90, 91, 113, 142, 155, 194, 231, 
269, and others discussed above in regard to AMPH 
neurotoxicity. There is considerably more consensus 
as to the nature of presynaptic changes accompany- 
ing behavioral sensitization when only those studies 
relevant to the phenomenon of behavioral sensitiza- 
tion are examined. 
The following review includes experiments in 
which presynaptic DA function was estimated by 
either: (1) measures of DA concentrations; (2) meas- 
ures of DA synthesis; and/or (3) measures of DA uti- 
lization or release. Each of these will be discussed in 
turn. These measures were obtained under either 
steady-state (resting) conditions, or following an ad- 
ditional 'challenge' injection of AMPH, and this is 
also noted. 
(1) DA concentrations. Table III lists studies in 
which striatal DA concentrations were measured in 
animals sensitized to AMPH. It is clear from Table 
III that AMPH pretreatment can produce robust be- 
havioral sensitization without causing a reduction in 
the steady-state concentrations of striatal DA (e.g. 
refs. 43,167,202 and unpublished studies by the au- 
thors)_ Following a challenge injection of AMPH, 
pretreated animals sometimes show a slightly greater 
decline in striatal DA concentrations than control an- 
imals202; but this is not always found 167. Two studies 
in which whole brain concentrations of DA were 
measured are also included in Table III, because 
striatal DA would comprise the largest fraction of 
whole brain DA. Again, AMPH pretreatment had 
no effect on the whole brain concentrations of DA. 
On the basis of the studies listed in Table III we 
would argue that a long-lasting depletion of DA in 
AMPH pretreated animals, over-and-above the tran- 
sient changes that might occur following enhanced 
DA release (e.g. ref. 202), is prima facie evidence for 
AMPH neurotoxicity. 
(2) DA synthesis. Table IV lists studies in which 
striatal (or whole brain) DA synthesis was estimated 
in AMPH-pretreated and control animals. The most 
consistent finding is that AMPH sensitization is not 
accompanied by changes in striatal DA synthesis un- 
der steady-state conditions, or following a subse-

tivity. Although Algeri et al. 7 and Taylor and Ho 29° 
found a decline in tyrosine hydroxylase activity in 
AMPH-pretreated animals, it should be noted that 
they used a very large dose of AMPH (10 mg/kg) and 
withdrew animals for only one day. It is unlikely that 
this latter effect is related to behavioral sensitization, 
but may be due to AMPH neurotoxicity. The only re-

port of an increase in striatal DA synthesis following 
AMPH-pretreatment 
is by Kuczenski and Leith ~67. 
They found a small (11-18%) enhancement in the 
conversion 
of 
[3H]tyrosine 
to 
[3H]dopamine 
in 
AMPH-pretreated 
rats. However, they also point 
out that the effect is not strong because, 'a statistical- 
ly significant increase is only observed when the num- 
ber of animals is large' (p. 407). It would be informa- 
tive to know if this effect persists for longer than the 
two-day withdrawal period used by Kuczenski and 
.Leith 167. In contrast, Kuczenski and Leith t67 did not 
find that AMPH-pretreatment enhanced DA synthe- 
sis following a subsequent challenge injection of 
AMPH (Table IV). 
(3) DA utilization/release. Table V lists studies in 
which the concentration of DA metabolites and/or 
the metabolite to transmitter ratios were used to esti- 
mate DA utilization. Dihydroxyphenylacetic 
acid 
(DOPAC) concentrations are thought to provide a 
good estimate of DA utilization/release because it is 
mostly formed from DA after re-uptake into the pre- 
synaptic terminal 162A74Ag7'246 (but see ref. 47). Table 
V also includes experiments in which the decline in 
DA concentrations following inhibition of tyrosine 
hydroxylase was used to estimate DA utilization 38. It 
should be noted that both of these measures of DA 
'turnover' are sensitive to changes in release. 
It is clear from Table V that there is little evidence 
for a change in striatal DA utilization in AMPH-sen- 
sitized animals when they are tested under steady- 
state conditions t67't83't91'2°2'243. In addition, sensitiza- 
tion does not alter the basal rate of endogenous DA 
efflux from striatal tissue in vitro 161'242'244, although 
the physiological significance of basal DA efflux in 
vitro is questionable because it is both temperature- 
and calcium-independent 29. In contrast to these neg- 
ative findings, Camp and Robinson 43 recently found 
significantly higher striatal DOPAC 
to DA ratios in 
AMPH-pretreated 
than in control rats, suggesting 
enhanced DA release. However, this was only in re-

male, but not male rats (Table V). Studies in which 
male rats were used report no effect of AMPH-pre- 
treatment on steady-state (resting) DA utiliza- 
tion 167'191'2°2. This sex difference may be related to 
the sex difference in behavioral sensitization 43,24°,244. 
Perhaps because female rats show more robust be- 
havioral sensitization than males, the neural corre- 
lates of behavioral sensitization will be more appar- 
ent in females. On the other hand, AMPH-pre- 
treated female rats did not show a greater decline in 
striatal DA following tyrosine hydroxylase inhibition 
than control female rats 243. It is not clear what ac- 
counts for the difference between the two methods 
for estimating DA utilization. Perhaps the effect is 
small and the former method is more sensitive to the 
neural 
consequences 
of 
repeated 
intermittent 
AMPH administration than the latter. Also, in the 
Robinson et al. 243 study only one point in time was 
sampled after tyrosine hydroxylase inhibition, and a 
more complete analysis of the rate of decline of DA is 
required to more accurately estimate DA utilization, 
especially given the low rate of striatal DA turnover. 
In contrast with the paucity of evidence for 
changes in DA utilization/release under steady-state 
conditions, there are a number of reports of en- 
hanced striatal DA utilization/release in AMPH-pre- 
treated animals given a subsequent challenge injec- 
tion of AMPH (Table V). Robinson and Becker 242 
first reported that repeated intermittent injections of 
AMPH in vivo produce an enduring enhancement (at 
least 10 days) in the AMPH-stimulated release of en- 
dogenous striatal DA in vitro, and more recent stud- 
ies suggest this effect persists for at least 30 days fol- 
lowing the last AMPH treatmend 6~,244. In addition, 
Robinson et al. TM found that even a single injection 
of 1.25 mg/kg of AMPH enhanced the AMPH-stimu- 
lated release of striatal DA measured in vitro 3-5 
weeks later. An enhancement in AMPH-stimulated 
striatal DA release in sensitized rats has now been 
obtained in 5 different studies conducted in two dif- 
ferent iabs 45A61'242'z44, and therefore it would appear 
to be a robust phenomenon. 
The effects of AMPH sensitization on DA release 
in vitro are consistent with a number of in vivo studies 
(Table V). Nishikawa et al. 2°2 reported that the el- 
evation of DOPAC to DA ratios produced by a chal- 
lenge injection of meth-AMPH was'enhanced follow- 
ing meth-AMPH pretreatment, 
suggesting that 
175 
AMPH stimulated more DA release in sensitized 
than in control animals. Furthermore, Kuczenski and 
Leith t67 found that a challenge injection of AMPH 
was more effective in decreasing DA metabolite lev- 
els in AMPH-pretreated than in control rats; an ef- 
fect that could be due to a leftward shift in the AMPH 
dose-response curve. In contrast, Jori and Bernar- 
di 127 found that AMPH pretreatment did not alter the 
effect of a challenge injection of AMPH on HVA 
concentrations. However, this could be because Jori 
and Bernardi 127 withdrew animals from AMPH for 
only one day, and there is evidence to suggest that 
more robust behavioral sensitization results if ani- 
mals are withdrawn for more than one day 16A12'161. 
Considering the tendency of behavioral sensitization 
to 'grow' over time following the withdrawal of 
AMPH 16'17A61, it is important to note that Kolta et 
al. 161 found that AMPH-stimulated striatal DA re- 
lease was not significantly enhanced 3 days after the 
last AMPH treatment, but was enhanced 15 and 30 
days later. This latter finding underscores the impor- 
tance of withdrawing animals from AMPH for a few 
days in studies concerned with the biological basis of 
behavioral sensitization. 
In conclusion, there is strong evidence that the be- 
havioral sensitization produced by the repeated in- 
termittent administration of AMPH is accompanied 
by an enduring enhancement in the release of striatal 
DA produced by re-exposure to AMPH (Table V). 
(It should be noted that a neurotoxic regimen of 
meth-AMPH administration does not enhance DA 
release, but may actually decrease meth-AMPH 
stimulated DA release 255. ) 
As an aside, there is an interesting difference be- 
tween the reports of Kuczenski and Leith 167 and Ni- 
shikawa 
et 
ai. z°2 
which 
deserves 
comment. 
Kuczenski and Leith 167 found that an acute injection 
of D-AMPH decreased striatal DA metabolite con- 
centrations, but Nishikawa et al. 2°2 reported that an 
acute injection of meth-AMPH increased DOPAC 
levels in AMPH-pretreated rats. The former effect 
would be expected if D-AMPH also blocked DA re- 
uptake into presynaptic terminals, thus reducing 
DOPAC (and HVA) formation 166. The latter effect 
would be expected as a consequence of enhanced DA 
release, but only if meth-AMPH did not prevent the 
re-uptake of DA into presynaptic terminals and its 
conversion into DOPAC. Perhaps meth-AMPH is

----- Page 20 (native) -----
176 
not as potent a re-uptake blocker as D-AMPH, and 
therefore DOPAC formation is enhanced following 
meth-AMPH, but decreased by D-AMPH. Unfortu- 
nately, we know of no direct comparison between the 
re-uptake blocking vs release enhancing properties 
of meth-AMPH and D-AMPH (e.g. ref. 89 and R.M. 
Ferris and K.E. Moore, personal communication). 
Because behavioral sensitization is accompanied 
by an enduring enhancement in the utilization/re- 
lease of striatal DA produced by re-exposure to 
AMPH, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that pre- 
synaptic changes in striatal DA neurons are at least 
partially responsible for the behavioral phenome- 
non. Of course, this would not exclude changes in 
other neural systems as well. But before reviewing 
evidence for changes in other neural systems, ideas 
concerning the cellular basis of enhanced striatal DA 
release in sensitized animals will be discussed. In 
doing so, it should be kept in mind that hypotheses 
regarding the nature of the cellular change(s) respon- 
sible for enhanced DA release are constrained by ev- 
idence that it occurs in the absence of changes in 
striatal DA concentrations (at least under steady- 
state conditions; Tables III, IV). 
5.3.1.3. Dopamine 
autoreceptor 
subsensitivity_ 
One hypothesis is that the repeated exposure to ab- 
normally high concentrations of DA produced by re- 
peated AMPH administration causes DA autorecep- 
tors 
to 
become 
subsensitive 16'26A86'195'259. It 
is 
thought that autoreceptors on the presynaptic termi- 
nals, cell body and/or dendrites of DA neurons con- 
trol DA synthesis, release and the discharge rate of 
the cell via negative feedback 86,314. Subsensitivity of 
these autoreceptors would result in a reduction in this 
negative feedback and enhanced DA release. In sup- 
port of this hypothesis, Muller and Seeman ~95 report- 
ed that repeated AMPH administration produced a 
decrease in [3H]apomorphine binding, but no change 
in [3H]haloperidol binding (Table II). They argued 
that the low concentrations of [3H]apomorphine used 
in their study reflected presynaptic DA receptor 
numbers. There is some question about this conclu- 
sion, however, for as White and Wang 317 pointed out, 
[3H]apomorphine may not selectively label DA auto- 
receptors ~75'26~. Nevertheless, the most consistent 
finding from striatal DA receptor binding studies is 
that repeated AMPH administration produces a 
small down-regulation (or no change) of DA recep- 
tors (Table II). It is possible this reflects a change in 
presynaptic DA receptors. 
Much of the evidence for DA autoreceptor subsen- 
sitivity in sensitized animals comes from electrophys- 
iological studies. These are summarized in Table VI. 
The firing rate of most mesencephalic DA neurons is 
decreased by the systemic application of either 
AMPH or APO, and this is thought to reflect nega- 
tive feedback mediated by DA autoreceptors 222. In 
animals previously exposed to repeated intermittent 
injections of AMPH, both AMPH and APO are less 
effective than normal in reducing the discharge rate 
of dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra, zona 
compacta (SNC 16'133'134) and ventral tegmental area 
(VTAI35'317). In fact, the firing rate of some DA cells 
is actually enhanced by AMPH or APO in AMPH- 
sensitized rats, an effect never seen in control ani- 
mals 16A33. Furthermore, the spontaneous firing rate 
of SNC and VTA units is increased 134,3t7 (although 
see also refs. 133, 134, 135 and Table VI), and the 
ability of iontophoretically applied DA to inhibit 
VTA unit discharge decreased in AMPH-sensitized 
rats 317. These effects could be due to subsensitive DA 
autoreceptors. The experiment with iontophoretical- 
ly applied DA 317 suggests that DA autoreceptors lo- 
cated on the cell bodies and/or dendrites of VTA cells 
are hyposensitive in sensitized animals. In contrast, 
the sensitivity of nigral zona reticulata neurons to 
AMPH is increased following repeated AMPH ad- 
ministration ~37, as is the sensitivity of SNC neurons to 
APO following a neurotoxic regimen of AMPH ad- 
ministration TM_ 
Although electrophysiological studies have sup- 
ported the DA autoreceptor subsensitivity hypothe- 
sis, biochemical/pharmacological studies designed to 
test the same hypothesis have not (Table VI)_ One 
biochemical approach has been to study the ability of 
low doses of APO to reduce the formation of the DA 
metabolites, DOPAC and HVA, an effect thought to 
be due to the selective stimulation of DA autorecep- 
tors 49A68. However, the repeated intermittent admin- 
istration of AMPH does not alter the ability of APO 
to reduce striatal DA metabolite levels, as would be 
expected 
if DA 
autoreceptors 
were 
subsensi- 
tive 49A68. A second approach has been to measure 
the ability of APO to inhibit DA synthesis stimulated 
by gamma-butyrolactone, which is also thought to be 
due to the action of APO at DA autoreceptors. But

----- Page 21 (native) -----
this is not altered in sensitized animals either 49. A 
third approach involves behavioral estimates of DA 
autoreceptor sensitivity. These have produced mixed 
support for the subsensitive autoreceptor hypothesis. 
At very low doses APO produces a decrease in loco- 
motion, presumably because DA autoreceptors are 
selectively stimulated and this reduces DA release. If 
DA autoreceptors were subsensitive in AMPH-pre- 
treated animals, low doses of APO should be less ef- 
fective in reducing locomotion, as reported by Antel- 
man and Chiodo ~7. However, using a very similar 
paradigm, Conway and Uretsky 49 found no evidence 
for DA autoreceptor subsensitivity in AMPH-pre- 
treated animals (Table VI). Furthermore, Riffee and 
177 
Wilcox TM reported that sensitization to AMPH does 
not alter the ability of APO to inhibit the locomotion 
produced by challenge injection of AMPH in mice 
(also R.E. Wilcox, personal communication). 
It is not clear why the electrophysiological and bio- 
chemical estimates of DA autoreceptor sensitivity 
are so discrepant. Perhaps one should disregard the 
biochemical/pharmacological studies for the moment 
and ask how well the available electrophysiological 
evidence accounts for behavioral sensitization. The 
answer is, not that well; as illustrated in the following 
examples. One problem is raised by the studies of 
Kamata and Rebec 133,134, who pretreated rats with 
either i or 5 mg/kg of D-AMPH two times a day for 6

days, and then tested them after one day of withdra- 
wal (Table VI). Pretreatment with either 1 or 5 
mg/kg of AMPH produces behavioral sensitization. 
However, when subsequently challenged with APO, 
only those animals pretreated with the 5 mg/kg dose 
of AMPH showed evidence of DA autoreceptor sub- 
sensitivity TM. In animals pretreated with 1 mg/kg 
there was actually a significant increase in the ability 
of AMPH to inhibit SNC unit discharge 133 (Table 
VI). This latter effect is opposite to that predicted by 
the DA autoreceptor subsensitivity hypothesis. 
A second problem with the electrophysiological 
studies concerns their ability to account for the per- 
sistence of behavioral sensitization. Animals remain 
hypersensitive to the motor stimulant effects of 
AMPH for months after the cessation of treat- 
ment 185'24°. As mentioned above, there is even evi- 
dence to suggest that for some period of time follow- 
ing withdrawal from AMPH there is a progressive in- 
crease in sensitivity 16'm'161'2n. The enhancement in 
AMPH-stimulated striatal DA release in AMPH- 
sensitized animals is also very persistent, being evi- 
dent weeks to months following withdrawal L61'242'244. 
.It is therefore unfortunate that in so many of the elec- 
trophysiological studies animals were withdrawn for 
only one day before testing (Table VI). This not only 
decreases the probability of observing changes re- 
lated to behavioral sensitization, given that the be- 
havioral effect and effect on AMPH-stimulated stria- 
tal DA release is larger with longer withdrawal peri- 
ods 161, but does not allow an evaluation of the per- 
sistence of electrophysiological changes that are ob- 
served_ 
Antelman and Chiodo ~6 did report that the de- 
crease in the ability of APO to inhibit SNC unit dis- 
charge seen in sensitized rats persisted for at least 11 
days_ However, White and Wang 3~7 found that in the 
VTA this effect was greatly attenuated after only 8 
days of withdrawal. White and Wang 317 gave rats 5 
mg/kg of AMPH for 7 days, either daily or twice 
daily, and then withdrew them for one or 8 days be- 
fore testing (Table VI). Both of these pretreatment 
regimens produce behavioral sensitization. In rats 
pretreated twice daily and withdrawn for 8 days, the 
decrease in the ability of AMPH or APO to inhibit 
VTA unit discharge was only 50% of that observed 
after one day of withdrawal. More importantly, in 
animals pretreated daily with AMPH there was no 
evidence of DA autoreceptor subsensitivity after 8 
days of withdrawal. These results suggest that in the 
VTA the electrophysiological signs of autoreceptor 
subsensitivity do not persist sufficiently long to ac- 
count for behavioral sensitization. More studies will 
be required to clearly establish whether the electro- 
physiological signs of autoreceptor subsensitivity in 
the SNC persist longer than in the VTA, as suggested 
by Antelman and Chiodo 16. 
There is a third feature of behavioral sensitization 
not accounted for by the electrophysiological evi- 
dence for DA autoreceptor subsensitivity. It is clear 
that enduring behavioral sensitization is produced by 
a single injection of AMPH t7"4°,24°,268, as are endur- 
ing changes in striatal DA release TM.HOwever, both 
Antelman and Chiodo 16 and White and Wang 317 re- 
ported that a single injection of AMPH does not alter 
the ability of APO to inhibit SNC or VTA unit dis- 
charge (Table VI). 
A final argument against the DA autoreceptor 
subsensitivity hypothesis is provided by studies on 
the role of DA terminal autoreceptors in the regula- 
tion of AMPH-stimulated striatal DA release. Auto- 
receptors on the presynaptic terminals of nigrostria- 
tal DA cells are thought to regulate the depolariza- 
tion-induced, calcium-dependent release of DA via 
negative feedback 92A72. However, it has been report- 
ed that AMPH-stimulated 
striatal DA release, a 
process that is calcium-independent and may involve 
an exchange-diffusion process 92, is not modulated by 
presynaptic DA autoreceptors ~32_ It is difficult to 
imagine how the increase in striatal DA release in vit- 
ro produced by sensitization could be due to a change 
in presynaptic DA autoreceptors if these receptors 
do not normally modulate AMPH-stimulated DA re- 
lease 173. 
In summary, the DA autoreceptor subsensitivity 
hypothesis initially seems to provide an attractive ex- 
planation of behavioral sensitization and enhanced 
striatal DA release in animals given repeated inter- 
mittent injections of AMPH, but it is not without 
problems. First, the electrophysiological evidence 
does not account for a number of critical features of 
behavioral sensitization. These include: (1) the be- 
havioral and neurochemical effects persist for weeks 
to months and, at least in the VTA, the electrophys- 
iological effects dissipate quickly317; (2) behavioral 
sensitization and enhanced striatal DA release are

----- Page 23 (native) -----
produced by a single injection of AMPH, but there is 
no evidence for DA autoreceptor subsensitivity after 
a single injection (Table VI); and (3) pretreatment 
with low doses of AMPH result in electrophysiologic- 
al effects opposite those predicted by the DA autore- 
ceptor subsensitivity hypothesis 133. Second, the bio- 
chemical studies do not support the electrophysiolog- 
ical evidence for DA autoreceptor subsensitivity, 
and 
the 
pharmacological/behavioral studies 
are 
equivocal. Third, AMPH-stimulated DA release in 
vitro appears not to be modulated by presynaptic DA 
autoreceptors ~73. It is concluded that the available 
evidence does not provide strong support for the hy- 
pothesis that either behavioral sensitization or the 
enhanced striatal DA release produced by repeated 
intermittent AMPH treatment is caused solely by 
subsensitive DA autoreceptors. Of course, it is possi- 
ble that there is a cascade of cellular changes that 
leads to the enduring behavioral and neurochemical 
signs of sensitization, and that changes in DA autore- 
ceptors represent but one stage in this process. 
5.3.1.4. Other hypotheses. If subsensitive DA au- 
toreceptors are not directly responsible for the en- 
during effects of sensitization, there must be other 
ways that repeated intermittent AMPH treatment 
produces an enhancement in AMPH-stimulated 
striatal DA release 242'244. These alternative hypoth- 
eses remain to be tested, but a couple deserve men- 
tion here for the sake of completion. 
One possibility is that there is simply more DA 
available for release in AMPH-sensitized animals. 
This could occur, in the absence of changes in overall 
DA concentrations, if there was a shift in the distri- 
bution of DA between two hypothesized intracellular 
'pools' of DA. It is thought that striatal DA is distrib- 
uted in two functional pools within the presynaptic 
terminal -- a newly synthesized, readily releasable 
pool with a rapid turnover rate, and a storage pool 
that turns over more slowly 97'192. AMPH may stimu- 
late DA release from the more readily releasable 
pool, because the behavioral response to AMPH is 
not depressed by depletion of vesicular DA stores 
with reserpine, but the motor stimulant (and euphor- 
ic) effects are depressed by synthesis inhibition with 
a-methyl-p-tyrosine 2'126'192'249"313. The 
fact 
that 
AMPH-induced DA release is calcium-independent 
supports this idea 29'26°'318. Therefore, if AMPH sensi- 
tization produced an increase in the size of the read- 
179 
ily releasable pool, and a concomitant decline in the 
size of the storage pool, there might be an en- 
hancement in AMPH-stimulated DA release without 
changes in overall DA concentrations. 
Another possibility is that the primary effect of 
AMPH sensitization is on neurons afferent to striatal 
DA terminals, and these presynaptically facilitate 
DA release by hyperpolarizing DA terminals. This 
could also increase the rate of DA/AMPH transport, 
and thereby enhance AMPH-stimulated DA re- 
lease 92A4°. To date there is no evidence for such an 
hypothesis. But it is an intriguing one, especially 
since the sensitization to electric shock in Aplysia de- 
scribed by Kandel and his colleagues is thought to be 
due to the facilitory effect of a hyperpolarizing pre- 
synaptic serotonergic input on subsequent transmit- 
ter release 138. It would be very interesting if a similar 
mechanism was involved in the behavioral sensitiza- 
tion described here. There is only limited evidence 
for changes in serotonergic activity in AMPH-sensi- 
tized animals (e.g. ref. 281 and unpublished obser- 
vations by the authors), and this requires further in- 
vestigation. There is also very little known about the 
influence of serotonin on striatal DA release 3~5, and 
we know of no studies on the effects of serotonin spe- 
cifically on AMPH-stimulated striatal DA release. 
In conclusion, there is good evidence for changes 
in the nigrostriatal DA system of sensitized animals, 
but considerably more work is required in even this 
most extensively studied system. Although it has 
been shown that striatal DA release/utilization is en- 
hanced following an AMPH challenge in sensitized 
animals, the cellular basis of this effect is not known, 
and its relationship to behavioral sensitization needs 
to be further clarified. Furthermore, the nigrostriatal 
DA system is probably not the only brain DA system 
altered by the repeated intermittent administration 
of AMPH. Evidence for changes in other DA sys- 
tems is discussed next. 
5.3.2. The mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine 
systems 
There are a number of reasons for suspecting that 
AMPH sensitization might alter mesolimbic or me- 
socortical DA systems. First, according to the cur- 
rent Zeitgeist it would be expected that any treat- 
ment known to produce severe cognitive and affec- 
tive disturbances in humans would also produce ab-

----- Page 24 (native) -----
180 
normalities in one or many limbic and cortical struc- 
tures. Second, there is indirect experimental evi- 
dence suggesting that mesolimbic or mesocortical 
DA systems are involved in behavioral sensitization. 
For example, Eichler and Antelman 7° reported that 
electrical self-stimulation in mesolimbic or mesocor- 
tical pathways sensitized rats to a subsequent injec- 
tion of AMPH. AMPH pretreatment also enhanced 
electrical self-stimulation at medial prefrontal cortex 
sites 236. Segal et al. 266 found that 6-OHDA lesions of 
the nucleus accumbens attenuated the development 
of behavioral sensitization, further implicating the 
mesolimbic DA system in sensitization 7°. In spite of 
this indirect evidence, there is not much direct evi- 
dence for changes in either mesolimbic or mesocorti- 
cal DA systems in animals repeatedly exposed to 
AMPH. This should not be taken to indicate that 
such changes do not exist, because it will become ob- 
vious in the following discussion that there have been 
very few attempts to identify neural changes in these 
structures using paradigms relevant to the phenome- 
non of behavioral sensitization. 
Studies on mesolimbic DA receptor binding in ani- 
.mals pretreated with AMPH are equivocal (Table 
VII). There are 4 reports of an increase, 3 of no 
change and 5 of a decrease in mesolimbic DA recep- 
tor binding (Table VII). It should be noted that in 
most of these studies extreme AMPH pretreatment 
regimens were used, and animals were withdrawn 
from AMPH for only one day 59,111,114'204,237'239. As 
previously mentioned, it is doubtful that this para- 
digm provides information relevant to the neural ba- 
sis of behavioral sensitization. As in the case of the 
striatum (Table II), it is concluded that there is no 
consistent evidence for changes in mesolimbic DA 
receptor binding in association with behavioral sensi- 
tization. 
In the two studies on DA receptor binding in the 
frontal cortex that were found, a decline in in vivo 
[3H]spiroperidol binding was reported in one t39, and 
no change in [3H]spiperone binding in the other 6. It is 
difficult to compare these studies because in the lat- 
ter one the animals were challenged with AMPH 1 h 
prior to being killed. Obviously, there is not suffi- 
cient evidence to draw 
any conclusions about 
changes in mesocortical DA receptors in sensitized 
animals. Nevertheless, the decrease in frontal cortex 
DA binding reported by Kaneno and Shimazono t39 is 
interesting in relation to evidence that AMPH sensi- 
tization enhances frontal cortex DA utilization 243 
(see below). This may be similar to the situation in 
the striatum, where there appears to be a small

down-regulation of DA receptors in response to en- 
hanced DA release in sensitized animals. 
Evidence that behavioral sensitization is accompa- 
nied by presynaptic changes in mesolimbic DA struc- 
tures is also quite limited (Table VIII). There is a 
consensus that the steady-state concentrations of me- 
solimbic DA are not altered by repeated intermittent 
injections of low doses of AMPH t67,t83`2°2 (and un- 
published studies by the authors), although sensi- 
tized animals may show a greater decline in DA lev- 
els than control animals when subsequently chal- 
lenged with meth-AMPH 2°2. The only study to exam- 
ine mesolimbic tyrosine hydroxylase activity reports 
no change in sensitized rats, suggesting mesolimbic 
DA synthesis is not altered 2°2. AMPH sensitization 
also does not seem to influence mesolimbic DA utili- 
zation under steady-state conditions, as indicated by 
DA metabolite levels 167,ts3,2°2, or the rate of the de- 
cline in DA after tyrosine hydroxylase inhibition 243 
(Table VIII). However, Camp and Robinson 43 have 
obtained preliminary evidence for enhanced nucleus 
accumbens DA metabolite levels (utilization?) in 
sensitized female, but not male rats. When sensitized 
rats 
were 
subsequently challenged with 
meth- 
AMPH, Nishikawa et al. 2°2 found that mesolimbic 
DA utilization was enhanced, but in a similar study 
Kuczenski and Leith 167 found no difference between 
181 
sensitized and control animals (Table VIII). There 
was a similar discrepancy between the reports of 
Kuczenski and Leith 167, who used D-AMPH, and Ni- 
shikawa et al. 2°2, who used meth-AMPH, in regards 
striatal DA utilization (Table V). In conclusion, 
more work is required to determine if AMPH sensiti- 
zation produces changes in mesolimbic DA activity. 
They may very well occur, but are only apparent in 
female animals, or when sensitized animals are sub- 
sequently challenged with a stimulus that increases 
dopaminergic activity (e.g. see the discussion of 
opiate-DA interactions below). 
We are aware of only one report that repeated in- 
termittent injections of AMPH produce enduring ef- 
fects on DA neurons projecting to the neocortex 
(Table VIII). In two independent experiments, Rob- 
inson et al. 243 found an enduring enhancement in me- 
dial prefrontal cortex DA utilization in OVX female 
rats previously exposed to AMPH, as indicated by an 
increase in the rate of decline of DA following tyro- 
sine hydroxylase inhibition. The significance of these 
enduring changes in mesocortical DA neurons to be- 
havioral sensitization, and how they are related to 
similar changes in the striatum (Table V) will be ex- 
plored in future studies. Nevertheless, it is encourag- 
ing that there is enhanced frontal cortex DA utiliza- 
tion in this animal model of AMPH psychosis, be-

5.3.3. Other neurotransmitter systems 
5.3.3.1. Opiate peptide-dopamine 
interactions_ 
Although the effects of repeated AMPH administra- 
tion on brain opiate peptide systems have not re- 
ceived much attention there is accumulating evi- 
dence that some of the enduring changes in behavior 
produced by the repeated administration of opiates 
may be mediated via changes in dopaminergic activ- 
ity. As with AMPH, tolerance develops to many of 
morphine's effects, but its motor stimulant effects are 
progressively enhanced upon repeated intermittent 
administration, either systemically 2° or into the ven- 
tral tegmental area (VTA128,3°7). The sensitizing ef- 
fects of systemic morphine are also very persistent, 
lasting for months following withdrawal 21'25. Mor- 
phine-induced sensitization of motor activity is prob- 
ably due to morphine's action on an endogenous mes- 
encephalic opiate system, because the daily adminis- 
tration of a peptidase-resistant enkephalin analog 
(DALA; D-Ala2-D-MetS-enkephalinamide) into the 
VTA also produces a progressive and enduring en- 
hancement in the motor stimulant effects of a subse- 
quent intra-VTA DALA challenge TM. This DALA- 
induced behavioral sensitization is blocked by nalox- 
one; and morphine or D-Ala2-D-LeuS-enkephalin, 
but not dynorphin, partially substitute for DALA TM. 
On the basis of this evidence Kalivas et al. TM have 
suggested that delta or mu, but not kappa opiate re- 
ceptors are probably involved in DALA-induced 
sensitization. 
Behavioral, electrophysiological and neurochem- 
ical studies suggest that some of the motor stimulant 
effects of opiates are due to opiate-DA interactions, 
and therefore the sensitizing effects of opiates could 
also be due to opiate-DA interactions (see refs. 129, 
131 for references). In support of this, Kalivas 129 has 
shown that in animals sensitized by daily intra-VTA 
DALA injections a subsequent challenge injection of 
intra-VTA DALA produces a greater enhancement 
in nucleus accumbens DOPAC and HVA concentra- 
tions than in non-sensitized controls, and that this ef- 
fect persists for at least 7 days. Interestingly, the 
steady-state concentrations of nucleus accumbens 
DA, DOPAC and HVA are not influenced by sensi- 
tization to DALA, which is similar to the situation 
following AMPH sensitization (Tables III, V). Fur- 
thermore, animals sensitized by intra-VTA DALA 
are hypersensitive to the motor stimulant effects of 
systemically administered AMPH or intra-VTA neu- 
rotensin, effects thought to be mediated by mesote- 
lencephalic DA neurons. They are not hypersensi- 
tive to the motor stimulant effects of caffeine, which 
are thought to be non-dopaminergic j29. Kalivas 129 
also presented evidence that neither changes in 
opioid nor postsynaptic DA receptors underlie intra- 
VTA DALA-induced sensitization. It is concluded 
that both AMPH and opiate peptides may produce 
some of their enduring effects on behavior by altering 
the presynaptic activity of mesotelencephalic DA 
neurons. 
5.3.3.2_ Norepinephrine. The effects of repeated 
intermittent injections of AMPH on indices of brain 
norepinephrine (NE) activity are summarized in 
Table IX. Some researchers have reported a small 
decline in brain NE concentrations after repeated 
AMPH administration 9'~s3,2°5,273, but in all instances 
animals were treated at least twice a day, for very 
long periods of time, and/or with relatively high 
doses of AMPH. Certainly AMPH treatment regi- 
mens that are toxic to DA neurons may also deplete 
NE 113'228'299. When a less extreme treatment regimen 
is used, or when animals are withdrawn for a longer 
period of time, repeated AMPH administration does 
not alter brain NE concentrations 9,69A°9'121'233 (and 
unpublished studies by the authors)_ There is also 
little evidence for changes in NE synthesis or release 
in AMPH sensitized rats~21,2s~; although admittedly 
there has been insufficient effort to identify such 
changes. One exception comes from studies on the 
noradrenergic input to cerebellar Purkinje cells. So- 
renson et al. 279 reported that 50 days following with- 
drawal from repeated AMPH treatment the dis- 
charge rate of Purkinje cells was abnormally low, and 
disruption of the NE input to these cells from the lo- 
cus coeruleus partially reversed this effect zTs. Fur- 
thermore, cerebellar cortex 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy- 
phenyl glycol (MHPG) concentrations were elevated 
10 days after withdrawal from AMPH, perhaps indi- 
cating enhanced NE release. MHPG levels had re- 
turned to control levels by 30 days of withdrawal 27s. 
The authors concluded that sensitization to AMPH 
enhances NE neurotransmission in the cerebellum.

----- Page 27 (native) -----
However, this cannot completely account for the ef- 
fect on Purkinje cells because removal of the NE in- 
put only partially reversed the effect 27S. 
The evidence for enduring changes in NE recep- 
tors is largely negative (Table IX). For example, Ba- 
nerjee et al. 24 reported an increase in [3H]DHA bind- 
ing after 1-2 days of withdrawal, but normal levels of 
[3H]DHA binding by 4 days of withdrawal. 
5.3.3.3. Serotonin. Serotonin-containing neurons 
modulate both brain DA activity and the behavioral 
effects of stimulant drugs, and therefore could be in- 
volved in the development of behavioral sensitiza- 
tion. However, there is very little direct evidence for 
changes in serotonergic systems in AMPH-sensitized 
animals. Again, this may be due to insufficient effort 
to identify such changes. Although steady-state brain 
5-hydroxytryptophan activity and serotonin concen- 
trations are not influenced by the repeated intermit- 
tent 
administration 
of 
non-toxic 
doses 
of 
AMPH t°9`lls'29° (and unpublished studies in this labo- 
183 
ratory), there is one intriguing report of altered sero- 
tonergic activity in AMPH-sensitized rats. Sparber 
and 
Tilson TM 
reported 
that 
AMPH-stimulated 
[3H]serotonin release into the lateral ventricle was 
significantly enhanced in rats treated with 2.5 mg/kg 
of AMPH each day for 8-12 days and withdrawn for 
one day. In control animals AMPH failed to stimu- 
late significant [3H]serotonin release. 
5.3.3.4. Amino acids. It has been suggested that 
glutamate release is decreased in schizophrenics 149, 
and therefore the effects of sensitization on amino 
acid transmitters is of interest. The repeated inter- 
mittent administration of meth-AMPH (4 mg/kg 
daily for 14 days) did reduce [3H]kainic acid binding 
in rat cerebral cortex, when measured 8 days after 
the last AMPH treatment. This suggests a reduction 
in glutamate receptors 143. Unfortunately, it is diffi- 
cult to assess how relevant studies on presynaptic in- 
dices of amino acid transmitter function are to behav- 
ioral sensitization, because in two studies animals

5.4. The neural basis of behavioral sensitization: con- 
clusions and a hypothesis 
Despite many attempts to identify an enduring 
neural change associated with repeated intermittent 
AMPH administration perusal of Tables I-IX re- 
veals that the neural basis of behavioral sensitization 
has not been thoroughly characterized. Neverthe- 
less, the available evidence does provide some prom- 
ising leads. The section of this review on 'neural hy- 
potheses' began with two questions: (1) what is the 
locus of the neural change(s) underlying behavioral 
sensitization; and (2) what is the nature of the 
change(s)? In answer to the first question, there is 
sufficient evidence to conclude that repeated inter- 
mittent exposure to AMPH alters mesotelencephalic 
DA systems. Of course, other neural systems are 
probably involved as well, but only DA systems have 
been studied in any detail. In answer to the second 
0 question, we propose that behavioral sensitization to 
AMPH is at least partly due to presynaptic changes 
characterized by enhanced DA release. 
Fig. 2 schematically illustrates some of the changes 
in brain DA neurons that could occur following the 
repeated intermittent administration of AMPH. Fig. 
2A illustrates the release of DA induced by AMPH in 
an animal exposed to AMPH for the first time. Note 
that DA release can be modulated by autoreceptors 
on the presynaptic terminal (autoreceptors on the 
cell body and dendrites are not illustrated), and/or by 
a presynaptic hyperpolarizing input (indicated by 
'-'). Fig. 2B illustrates the same terminal after the an- 
imal has been repeatedly and intermittently exposed 
to AMPH, and then after a withdrawal period (weeks 
to month later) is again challenged with AMPH. It is 
known that there is an enhanced behavioral response 
to this challenge injection of AMPH, and the best ev- 
idence available to date suggests it is due to enhanced 
DA release (item no. 1 on Fig. 2B). There is no con- 
vincing evidence for changes in postsynaptic DA re- 
ceptors (indicated by '2' on Fig. 2B), except perhaps 
a small down-regulation that we propose is secondary 
to enhanced DA release. The nature of the cellular 
change underlying enhanced DA release in sensi- 
tized animals is not known. A number of possibilities 
are schematically illustrated in Fig. 2B. One possibil- 
ity is that the autoreceptors regulating DA release or 
discharge rate are subsensitive ('3'). However, as 
discussed above, the available evidence for autore- 
ceptor subsensitivity is equivocal, and fails to account 
for many of the characteristics of behavioral sensiti- 
zation and the persistence of enhanced DA release. 
Other possibilities include presynaptic facilitation by 
hyperpolarization of the DA terminal via a presynap- 
tic input ('4'), or a shift in the distribution of DA from 
a 'storage pool' to a more readily releasable pool 
('5'). There is no evidence for a change in total DA 
concentrations, at least during the resting state (note 
that the number of DA 'molecules' illustrated in Fig. 
2A and B is the same), or in DA synthesis rate ('6'). • 
Future research on the nature of presynaptic changes 
in mesotelencephalic DA systems, and on changes in 
other neurotransmitter systems that influence dopa- 
minergic activity will be required to further elucidate 
the neural basis of behavioral sensitization. In partic- 
ular, it will be important in future studies to try and 
relate changes in specific neural systems (e.g. the 
mesolimbic, mesocorticai or nigrostriatal DA sys- 
tems) to changes in specific behaviors (e.g. locomo- 
tion, the various components of stereotypy, rotation- 
al behavior). 
One final point to be made here concerns the ambi- 
guity created in the literature when studies involving 
neurotoxic AMPH treatment regimens are cited as 
being relevant to the neural basis of behavioral sensi- 
tization, and vice versa. This should be avoided. 
Some of the problem is simply because the same 
terms are frequently used to refer to different phe- 
nomena. For example, the phrase 'repeated AMPH 
administration' is used to refer to both: (1) treatment 
paradigms in which very high doses are repeatedly 
given, which in effect continuously elevates brain 
concentrations of AMPH and produces neurotoxici- 
ty; and (2) paradigms relevant to behavioral sensiti- 
zation, in which repeated but intermittent injections 
of non-toxic low doses are used. It is suggested that 
individual researchers make a greater effort to iden- 
tify whether the paradigm they use is more relevant 
to the 'AMPH neurotoxicity syndrome', or the phe- 
nomenon of behavioral sensitization; and to be care- 
ful about citing evidence relevant to only one phe- 
nomenon as being relevant to the other.

6. GENERALIZABILITY OF SENSITIZATION 
6.1. Stimulants and stress 
Thus far behavioral sensitization has been de- 
scribed as a special kind of behavioral plasticity, 
where a relatively short-term pharmacological ma- 
nipulation (exposure to AMPH) produces a very 
long-lasting change in the response induced by subse- 
quent exposure to the same stimulus. However, it is 
worth noting at this time that behavioral sensitization 
is not unique to the psychopharmacology of psycho- 
motor stimulant drugs, but can be produced by non- 
pharmacologic environmental stimuli as well. For ex- 
ample, there are many studies showing that repeated 
intermittent stress can sensitize the hypothalamo-pi- 
tuitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Daily immobilization or 
footshock stress produces a dramatic and progressive 
increase 
in 
plasma 
corticosterone 
concentra- 
tions 1°6'2~9, and in adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase and 
phenylethanolamine-N-methyl-transferase 
activity 
(PNMT~71). Repeated intermittent stress also en- 
185 
hances many of the central and behavioral conse- 
quences of subsequent stress 4'13'14'17"44'282. Of direct 
relevance to the behavioral sensitization produced by 
stimulants is evidence that daily injections of cocaine 
produce a progressive enhancement in plasma nor- 
epinephrine 
(NE) 
and 
epinephrine 
concentra- 
tions ~°2, and in particular that repeated exposure to 
stress sensitizes brain DA systems ~s'1°3'216. It has 
even been suggested that some of the enduring ef- 
fects of stimulant drugs on brain and behavior are 
due to their action as stressors 17-t9,212. 
Much of the evidence for an association between 
AMPH sensitization and sensitization to stress comes 
from a series of experiments by Antelman and his 
colleagues, who studied the effect of a variety of 
stressors on the stereotyped behavior produced by a 
subsequent injection of AMPH (for review see ref. 
17). Exposure to stressors such as tail pinch, food 
deprivation or footshock all enhance the stereotypy 
(or polydipsia) produced by an injection of AMPH 
given weeks later 15't7'19'7°. Studies by other research- 
ers have subsequently shown that immobilization or 
footshock stress also produce an enduring en- 
hancement in AMPH-induced locomotion l°s and ro- 
tational behavior 24t (see also ref. 105). 
Not only does previous exposure to stress enhance 
AMPH-induced behavior, but previous exposure to 
AMPH may influence the effects of subsequent 
stress. For example, Antelman et al. 15 reported that 
rats previously exposed to AMPH are more sensitive 
to the activational effects of tail pinch. The effects of 
footshock stress on indices of brain DA activity are 
also altered by sensitization to AMPH (unpublished 
studies by the authors). Mild footshock stress is 
known to enhance DA utilization in a number of 
brain regions, as indicated by increased DOPAC 
concentrations, or DOPAC to DA ratios 174"227 (cf. 
ref. 291). We have found that 5 min of mild footshock 
produces a greater elevation in the ratio of DOPAC 
to DA in the medial prefrontal cortex and hypothala- 
mus of sensitized female rats than in saline-injected 
or non-handled control animals, perhaps due to en- 
hanced DA release (unpublished studies). Thus, it 
appears that AMPH and stress may be to some extent 
interchangeable in producing sensitization. 
Evidence that sensitization to stress may involve 
enduring changes in mesotelencephalic DA systems 
is also suggested by recent studies by Kalivas et al. t30

----- Page 30 (native) -----
186 
on the effects of intra-VTA injections of the enkeph- 
alin analog, DALA. When injected into the VTA, 
DALA produces hyperactivity, an effect that is 
thought to be due to the DALA-induced release of 
DA in the nucleus accumbens TM. Furthermore, the 
repeated intermittent administration of DALA pro- 
duces a progressive sensitization of motor activity, 
and this is accompanied by sensitization of mesolim- 
bic DA systems 129d31. Interestingly, previous expo- 
sure to mild footshock stress also sensitizes animals 
to the motor stimulant effects of intra-VTA DALA, 
and animals sensitized to DALA show an exagger- 
ated dopaminergic response to subsequent stress ~3°. 
In conclusion, there is sufficient evidence to sug- 
gest that the repeated intermittent exposure to either 
pharmacologic or environmental stimuli that activate 
brain DA systems can produce enduring changes in 
DA neurons, and that these changes are character- 
ized by hyperresponsivity to stimuli that subsequent- 
ly activate brain DA systems_ 
6.2. Sex differences, stimulants and stress 
It was mentioned above that there are robust sex 
differences in the sensitization to AMPH. If sensiti- 
zation to AMPH and stress are to some extent inter- 
changeable, as just suggested, it follows that there 
should also be sex differences in the sensitization to 
stress. Although the evidence is limited, a review of 
the literature reveals that there are remarkably simi- 
lar sex differences in both the acute and chronic ef- 
fects of AMPH and stress. 
(a) Acute effects. Female rats show a much greater 
behavioral response to an acute injection of AMPH 
than males, as indicated by measures of locomotor 
activity ~88, stereotyped activity 27 or rotational behav- 
ior 31"36'244"245. This sex difference in AMPH-induced 
behavior is not due to sex differences in the metabo- 
lism of AMPH 1°1,144as9, because it persists when 
males are given considerably higher systemic doses 
of AMPH than females 36, or when doses are titrated 
so males and females have equivalent brain levels of 
AMPH 31'43. There is a similar sex difference in the 
response of the HPA axis to acute stress. Female rats 
show a much greater and more persistent elevation of 
plasma corticosterone than males in response to 
either immobilization, footshock or forced running 
stress 141ASl, or to a direct injection of ACTH TM. The 
release of ACTH to a 3 min 'psychological' stress is 
also greater in female than in male rats 178. 
These sex differences may be related to the effects 
of gonadal hormones on brain DA activity and the 
HPA axis. Gonadal hormones are known to mod- 
ulate striatal and hypothalamic DA release and re- 
ceptors in a sexually dimorphic manner 28'3°'116'3°4, 
and male and female gonadal hormones differential- 
ly effect the HPA axis. For example, Kitay 52'~5° has 
shown that ovariectomy (OVX) decreases both the 
pituitary secretion of ACTH and plasma corticoster- 
one 57, presumably due to a reduction in ACTH syn- 
thesis and the sensitivity of the pituitary to corticotro- 
pin-releasing factor (CRF). In sharp contrast, castra- 
tion (CAST) of male rats increases plasma ACTH at 
rest or after stress, and this is reversed by testoster- 
one replacement 53a5°. Kitay 15° has suggested that en- 
dogenous gonadal hormones in males and females in- 
fluence HPA activity in an opposing fashion. 
(b) Chronic effects. As discussed above, females 
show much more robust sensitization to repeated in- 
termittent injections of AMPH than males, and this is 
not affected by OVX 24°'244. In contrast, CAST males 
show greater sensitization to AMPH than intact 
males and are comparable to females. We know of 
only one study on sex differences in the response of 
the HPA axis to repeated intermittent stress, but the 
similarity to the pattern of sex differences seen with 
AMPH sensitization is striking 1°6. 
Hennessy et a1.1°6 (see for review ref. 107) showed 
that in gonadally intact female mice the plasma corti- 
costerone response to footshock stress is sensitized 
by daily footshock sessions. OVX produced a general 
decline in the circulating levels of corticosterone in 
all groups, but OVX rats still showed a clear sensiti- 
zation of the corticosterone response with repeated 
stress. In contrast, gonadally intact male mice did not 
sensitize to repeated stress. That is, in intact males 
the elevation in plasma corticosterone was the same 
after the 10th shock session as it was after the first. 
On the other hand, CAST male mice did show sensi- 
tization, having significantly higher plasma cortico- 
sterone levels after the 10th than after the first shock 
session 106. 
In summary, the available evidence suggests that: 
(1) females show more robust sensitization in re- 
sponse to repeated AMPH or stress than do males; 
(2) removal of the ovaries has no (or little) effect on

----- Page 31 (native) -----
the sensitization produced by repeated AMPH or 
stress; and (3) removal of the testes enhances the de- 
velopment of sensitization to both repeated AMPH 
or stress. It is therefore possible that a testicular hor- 
mone directly or indirectly retards the development 
of enduring changes in brain and behavior produced 
by the repeated intermittent application of either 
AMPH or stress_ 
7. CONCLUSIONS 
In conclusion, we agree with previous suggestions 
that the hyperdopaminergic state and resultant 
changes in behavior produced by an acute injection 
of moderate to high doses of AMPH provides a rea- 
sonable model of some changes in brain and behavior 
associated with some forms of schizophrenia 196' 
219.220264. That is, amphetamine psychosis, and possi- 
bly paranoid schizophrenia, are associated with, 
'high concentrations of DA at the synapse '2°4 (p. 
216). Lower doses of AMPH do not usually produce 
the perseverative stereotyped behavior so similar to 
that seen in AMPH psychosis and schizophrenia. 
However, when low doses of AMPH are repeatedly 
and intermittently administered they also come to 
produce high DA concentrations at the synapse, 
which we propose is due to a progressive en- 
hancement in DA release_ This enhancement in DA 
release is manifested as behavioral sensitization in 
non-human animals and AMPH psychosis in hu- 
mans. Furthermore, in individuals sensitized to 
AMPH other stimuli (e.g. stressors), that do not nor- 
mally cause a large release of DA, may come to do 
so, thereby also producing symptoms associated with 
psychotic disorders. 
It will require considerably more research with 
new techniques to establish whether schizophrenia 
and AMPH psychosis are accompanied by enhanced 
DA release. The fact that the neurochemical effects 
of sensitization have been difficult to identify under 
steady-state conditions, but are often apparent only 
following a 'challenge' to the system, may help ex- 
plain why evidence for presynaptic changes in schizo- 
phrenics has been to elusive 1°3'3°6. Not only is it diffi- 
cult to obtain valid measures of presynaptic activity 
in human subjects, but matters are further compli- 
cated because it may be necessary to 'challenge' sub- 
jects just prior to analysis in order to easily detect 
187 
neurochemical alterations. Perhaps with the devel- 
opment of new non-invasive techniques for imaging 
neural activity in humans (e.g. PET, NMR) some of 
these issues will be resolved. Nevertheless, it is inter- 
esting to note in this regard that plasma HVA levels 
are elevated in schizophrenics. There is also a strong 
positive correlation between the severity of the psy- 
chosis and HVA levels 61,2°s (see also ref. 295), and 
the reduction in psychosis produced by neuroleptic 
treatment is correlated with a reduction in plasma 
HVA levels 2°s. Enhanced plasma HVA levels could 
be due to elevated levels of DA release, but unfortu- 
nately there are many other possible explanations for 
these results (e.g. ref. 47). 
There is growing evidence to support the sugges- 
tion that sensitization is not unique to the psycho- 
pharmacology of stimulant drugs 17'19'212, but can be 
produced by any stimulus that greatly increases brain 
catecholamine 
activity, 
including 
environmental 
stimuli. For example, we discussed evidence that the 
repeated administration of AMPH, an enkephalin 
analog or stress all sensitize brain DA systems. It re- 
mains to be determined if the sensitization produced 
by different agents has the same cellular basis, but 
thus far the sensitization produced by AMPH and 
stress seems to be quite interchangeable. Animals 
that have been previously exposed to AMPH or 
stress often show an exaggerated response when sub- 
sequently challenged with an injection of AMPH, or 
further stress. In fact, it may be that sensitized ani- 
mals are hyperresponsive to any stimulus that activates 
brain catecholamine systems, and that the effects of 
sensitization are not obvious in the absence of such 
stimuli. This may help explain why psychosis only 
tends to recur in former AMPH addicts following re- 
exposure to AMPH or exposure to 'physical or psy- 
chological stress '3°2, and why stress is considered a 
precipitating agent in psychiatric disorders thought 
to involve brain catecholamine dysfunction 13A7'~' 
39,63,103,210 
Lastly, it should be noted that there is great indi- 
vidual variation in the susceptability to sensitization, 
just as there is in the acute effects of stimulants and 
stress12,a2,99,191,22t. 
It was discussed how sex-related hormonal varia- 
bles may influence the development of sensitization 
to AMPH or stress, and some researchers have be- 
gun to explore genetic influences 42A77'274. But for the

----- Page 32 (native) -----
188 
most part, factors that account for individual varia- 
tion in the responsiveness to stimulants and stress 
have received very little attention. Increased knowl- 
edge of these will be important in understanding the 
etiology of stimulant-induced psychosis and the ma- 
jor endogenous psychoses, especially given the com- 
plex interplay between environmental and biological 
variables in the development of psychoses 13'18,99"216. 
Research on how genetic, hormonal and environ- 
mental factors influence sensitization to stimulants 
and stress will be valuable in this regard. 
8. SUMMARY 
Some people who repeatedly use stimulant drugs, 
such as amphetamine (AMPH), develop an AMPH- 
induced psychosis that is similar to paranoid schizo- 
phrenia. There has been, therefore, considerable in- 
terest in characterizing the effects of chronic stimu- 
lant drug treatment on brain and behavior in non-hu- 
man animals, and in developing an animal model of 
AMPH psychosis. A review of this literature shows 
that in non-human animals chronic AMPH treatment 
"can produce at least two different syndromes, and 
both of these have been proposed as animal models 
of AMPH psychosis. The first syndrome is called 
'AMPH neurotoxicity', and is produced by maintain- 
ing elevated brain concentrations of AMPH for pro- 
longed periods of time. AMPH neurotoxicity is char- 
acterized by what has been termed 'hallucinatory- 
like' behavior, which occurs in association with brain 
damage resulting in the depletion of striatal DA and 
other brain monoamines. The second syndrome is 
called 'behavioral sensitization', and is produced by 
the repeated intermittent administration of lower 
doses of AMPH. Behavioral sensitization is charac- 
terized by a progressive and enduring enhancement 
in many AMPH-induced behaviors, and is not ac- 
companied by brain damage or monoamine deple- 
tion. It is argued that the changes in the brain and be- 
havior associated with the phenomenon of behavior- 
al sensitization provide a better 'model' of AMPH 
psychosis than those associated with AMPH neuro- 
toxicity. 
Much of the review involves a critical analysis of 
hypotheses regarding the biological basis of behav- 
ioral sensitization. Research on this question has fo- 
cused on mesotelencephalic DA systems, and sug- 
gestions that behavioral sensitization is accompanied 
by: (1) an increase in postsynaptic DA receptors; (2) 
an increase in DA synthesis; (3) an increase in DA 
utilization and/or release; and (4) a decrease in DA 
autoreceptors, are evaluated. It is concluded that 
there is not convincing evidence for an increase in 
postsynaptic DA receptors or in DA synthesis in ani- 
mals sensitized to AMPH. In contrast, there is strong 
evidence to support the notion that behavioral sensi- 
tization is due to enhanced mesotelencephalic DA 
release, especially upon re-exposure to the drug. The 
evidence that this enhancement in DA release is due 
to autoreceptor subsensitivity was found to be equiv- 
ocal, and therefore other hypotheses should be en- 
tertained. 
Lastly, evidence is discussed in support of the idea 
that behavioral sensitization is not unique to the psy- 
chopharmacology of stimulant drugs, but may be 
produced by many environmental stimuli that direct- 
ly or indirectly activate brain catecholamine systems. 
For example, there are many studies showing that 
AMPH and stress are to some extent interchange- 
able in producing both behavioral sensitization and 
long-term changes in brain DA systems. It is con- 
cluded that sensitized animals may be hyperrespon- 
sive to any stimulus that activates brain catechola- 
mine systems, and that the effects of sensitization are 
not obvious in the absence of such stimuli. This may 
be related to the fact that psychosis only tends to re- 
cur in former AMPH addicts following re-exposure 
to AMPH or stress, and that stress is considered a 
precipitating factor in psychiatric disorders thought 
to involve brain catecholamine dysfunction.
