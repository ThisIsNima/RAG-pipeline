Global environmental change and sustainability science increas-
ingly recognize the need to address the consequences of changes
taking place in the structure and function of the biosphere. These
changes raise questions such as: Who and what are vulnerable to
the multiple environmental changes underway, and where? Re-
search demonstrates that vulnerability is registered not by expo-
sure to hazards (perturbations and stresses) alone but also resides
in the sensitivity and resilience of the system experiencing such
hazards. This recognition requires revisions and enlargements in
the basic design of vulnerability assessments, including the capac-
ity to treat coupled human–environment systems and those link-
ages within and without the systems that affect their vulnerability.
A vulnerability framework for the assessment of coupled human–
environment systems is presented.
R
esearch on global environmental change has significantly
improved our understanding of the structure and function of
the biosphere and the human impress on both (1). The emer-
gence of ‘‘sustainability science’’ (2–4) builds toward an under-
standing of the human–environment condition with the dual
objectives of meeting the needs of society while sustaining the
life support systems of the planet. These objectives, in turn,
require improved dialogue between science and decision making
(5–8). The vulnerability of coupled human–environment sys-
tems is one of the central elements of this dialogue and sustain-
ability research (6, 9–11). It directs attention to such questions
as: Who and what are vulnerable to the multiple environmental
and human changes underway, and where? How are these
changes and their consequences attenuated or amplified by
different human and environmental conditions? What can be
done to reduce vulnerability to change? How may more resilient
and adaptive communities and societies be built?
Answers to these and related questions require conceptual
frameworks that account for the vulnerability of coupled
human–environment systems with diverse and complex linkages.
Various expert communities have made considerable progress in
pointing the way toward the design of these frameworks (10, 11).
These advances are briefly reviewed here and, drawing on them,
we present a conceptual framework of vulnerability developed by
the Research and Assessment Systems for Sustainability Pro-
gram (http:sust.harvard.edu) that produced the set of works in
this Special Feature of PNAS. The framework aims to make
vulnerability analysis consistent with the concerns of sustain-
ability and global environmental change science. The case study
by Turner et al. (12) in this issue of PNAS illustrates how the
framework informs vulnerability assessments.
The Emergence of Vulnerability Analysis
Approaches to and Composition of Vulnerability. Vulnerability is
the degree to which a system, subsystem, or system component
is likely to experience harm due to exposure to a hazard, either
a perturbation or stressstressor.i This definition and the
concept it addresses are not new (13); they have emerged from
sustained research and practice on risks and hazards, climate
impacts, and resilience (14). A central lesson of this work
recognizes that a focus limited to perturbations and stressors
is insufficient for understanding the impacts on and responses
of the affected system or its components (15–17). This lesson
is underscored in two archetypal reduced-form models that
have informed vulnerability analysis: the risk-hazard (RH) and
pressure-and-release (PAR) models.
Foundational RH models (Fig. 1) sought to understand the
impact of a hazard as a function of exposure to the hazard event
and the dose–response (sensitivity) of the entity exposed (18,
19). Past quantitative applications of this model in environmen-
tal and climate impact assessment generally emphasized expo-
sure and sensitivity to perturbations and stressors (20, 21) and
worked from the hazard to the impacts. In some cases, vulner-
ability was explicitly addressed in the text, if not formally
incorporated into the models used (19, 22). Various lines of
investigation reveal the inadequacies of this RH model frame-
work. For example, it does not treat: (i) the ways in which the
systems in question amplify or attenuate the impacts of the
hazard (23–26); (ii) the distinctions among exposed subsystems
and components that lead to significant variations in the con-
sequences of the hazards (27–31); and (iii) the role of political
economy, especially social structures and institutions, in shaping
differential exposure and consequences (32–39).
This recognition led to the PAR model (Fig. 2), in which risk
is explicitly defined as a function of the perturbation, stressor, or
stress and the vulnerability of the exposed unit (32). It directs
attention to the conditions that make exposure unsafe, leading
to vulnerability and to the causes creating these conditions. Used
primarily to address social groups facing disaster events, the
application of the model emphasizes distinctions in vulnerability
by different exposure units (e.g., class, ethnicity). Although
explicitly highlighting vulnerability, the PAR model seems in-
sufficiently comprehensive for the broader concerns of sustain-
ability science. Primarily, it does not address the coupled
human–environment system in the sense of considering the
vulnerability of biophysical subsystems (16); it provides little
detail on the structure of the hazard’s causal sequence, including
the nested scales of interactions; and it tends to underemphasize
Abbreviations: RH, risk hazards; PAR, pressure and release.

iHazards are deﬁned as threats to a system, comprised of perturbations and stress (and
stressors), and the consequences they produce. A perturbation is a major spike in pressure
(e.g., a tidal wave or hurricane) beyond the normal range of variability in which the system
operates. Perturbations commonly originate beyond the system or location in question.
Stress is a continuous or slowly increasing pressure (e.g., soil degradation), commonly
within the range of normal variability. Stress often originates and stressors (the source of
stress) often reside within the system. Risk is the probability and magnitude of conse-
quences after a hazard (perturbation or stress).

feedback beyond the system of analysis that integrative RH
models include (19).
Anticipated by or explicitly embedded within the RH and
PAR models, the development of vulnerability analysis draws
on three major concepts: entitlement, coping through diver-
sity, and resilience (16). Different systems maintain different
sensitivities to perturbations and stressors, and this character-
istic for individuals and groups (human) is strongly linked to
entitlements: legal and customary rights to exercise command
over food and other necessities of life (40). For example,
modern famines follow not from insufficient food stocks but
from the inability of social units to command food access
through legal and customary means (41). These entitlements
are determined by the units’ endowments, especially what they
have to sell, their ability to sell, and the price received; the cost
of food relative to endowments; and access to markets and
resources (40). Entitlement helps to explain why certain social
units are differentially at risk (32).
Social units also have different coping capacities, which enable
them to respond to the registered harm as well as to avert the
potential harm of a hazard. In one sense, entitlement and
endowment link to these capacities, and either concept can be
expanded to include a large array of social institutions, such as
societal ‘‘safety nets,’’ that empower coping capacity (42). Yet
entitlement and endowment are commonly reduced to questions
of poverty, masking recognition that social units are not passive,
and even the most economically marginal of them use a range of
strategies to increase their defense mechanisms against hazards
(43). Diversification is an overarching strategy aimed at reducing
risks and increasing options in the face of hazards used world-
wide and across economic classes and political economies, in
some cases at the cost of reduced material well being (29, 32, 34,
37, 38, 44, 45). Such strategies notwithstanding, much of enti-
tlement, endowment, and coping capacity rests within social,
economic, institutional, and political structures (44–46), and
therefore vulnerability analysis must account for them.
The third concept, resilience, enters vulnerability analysis
from ecology, where it has evolved in meaning through
extended debate and application. The concept has been used
to characterize a system’s ability to bounce back to a reference
state after a disturbance (47, 48) and the capacity of a system
to maintain certain structures and functions despite distur-
bance (49, 50). Recognizing that ecosystems often exhibit non-
and multiequilibria dynamics, current resilience theories en-
vision ecosystems as constantly changing (49, 51–53). As a
result, the resilience of the system is often evaluated in terms
of the amount of change a given system can undergo (e.g., how
much disturbance or stress it can handle) and still remain
within the set of natural or desirable states (i.e., remain within
the same ‘‘configuration’’ of states, rather than maintain a
single state). Resilience and related concepts influence a
variety of interdisciplinary research focused on coupled
human–environment systems (53–56), especially through the
key component of ‘‘adaptive capacity,’’ the flexibility of eco-
systems, and the ability of social systems to learn in response
to disturbances (57). Because different systems differ in their
resilience characteristics, the explicit incorporation of differ-
ential resilience has become a critical element of analysis in
human–environment systems.
Essential Elements for Expanded Vulnerability Analysis. The sustain-
ability theme enlarges and redirects the focus of vulnerability
analysis in several ways (10, 27, 28, 58–60). Primarily, it directs
attention to coupled human–environment systems, the vulner-
ability and sustainability of which are predicated on synergy
between the human and biophysical subsystems as they are
affected by processes operating at different spatiotemporal (as
well as functional) scales. We identify the following elements for
inclusion in any vulnerability analysis, particularly those aimed at
advancing sustainability:
(i) Multiple interacting perturbations and stressorsstresses
and the sequencing of them;
(ii) Exposure beyond the presence of a perturbation and
stressorstress, including the manner in which the coupled
system experiences hazards;
(iii) Sensitivity of the coupled system to the exposure;
(iv) The system’s capacities to cope or respond (resilience),
including the consequences and attendant risks of slow (or poor)
recovery;
(v) The system’s restructuring after the responses taken (i.e.,
adjustments or adaptations); and
(vi) Nested scales and scalar dynamics of hazards, coupled
systems, and their responses.
In addition to these general elements, we suggest that ap-
proaches to and emphases within the vulnerability analysis are
most useful to decision making (12, 60–62) when they:
(i) Complement the traditional perturbationstressor-to-
consequence approach by considering the outcomes to be
avoided and working backwards toward the perturbation or
stressor, thus elevating the need for stakeholder input;
(ii) Profile differential vulnerability, because subsystems and
components of the coupled system are rarely equally vulnerable,
no matter how the system may be bounded;
(iii) Are cognizant of the stochastic and nonlinear elements
operating on and within the coupled system, giving rise to
unexpected or surprise outcomes;
(iv) Give attention to the role of institutions operating as
stressors or as a structure affecting system sensitivity and
resilience;
(v) Identify suspect causal structures that affect vulnerability
and test the cause-and-effect links through which they operate;
(vi) Develop appropriate metrics and measures for assess-
ments, models, and tests; and
(vii) Develop institutional structures for linking vulnerability
analyses to decision making, focusing on the salience, credibility,
and legitimacy of information produced.
Vulnerability analysis may be undertaken at any spatial or

temporal scale suitable for the problem in question. The strong
variation in vulnerability by location, even to hazards created by
global-scale processes and phenomena, however, elevates the
role of ‘‘place-based’’ analysis (6, 28, 63–66). The term ‘‘place-
based’’ implies a spatially continuous distinctive ‘‘ensemble’’ of
human and biophysical conditions or coupled human–
environment systems (6, 67).j The growing role of multiple
stakeholders in defining vulnerability problems, typical with
local or localized concerns, lends increasing attention to this
level of analysis while simultaneously linking to other places and
scales of analysis (53, 64, 68).
Place-based approaches do not preclude the ability to develop
general characterizations of the vulnerability of coupled systems
(69). On the contrary, the use of place-based approaches makes
obvious the need to find methods to operationalize vulnerability
analysis that are useful for the specificity of place and for
building general concepts from them. Some methodological
approaches relevant for this search include semiquantitative
typologies, such as ‘‘degradation syndromes’’ (70), complex
indicator approaches (71–74), integrated modeling and simula-
tion techniques (75), and statistical downscaling (75–77). The
development of basic measures and metrics necessary for re-
search and assessment is a subject of active research.
A particular strength of place-based analysis is its potential for
increased public involvement and collaborative assessment, as
advocated in the analytic–deliberative paradigm of risk analysis
set forth by the National Research Council in its Understanding
Risk: Informing Decisions in a Democratic Society (78) and in the
U.S. National Assessment of The Potential Consequences of
Climate Variability and Change (68). Creating effective strategies
for reconciling and integrating lay and expert knowledge will
prove challenging, but some promising models exist in various
works (75, 79–81) that must also consider normative issues (71).
A Framework Revealed: Complexity Simplified and Illustrated
Comprehensive vulnerability analysis ideally considers the to-
tality of the system. This ideal, however, is unrealistic. Real-
world data and other constraints invariably necessitate a ‘‘re-
duced’’ vulnerability assessment. Nevertheless, analysts must
remain aware that vulnerability rests in a multifaceted coupled
system with connections operating at different spatiotemporal
scales and commonly involving stochastic and nonlinear pro-
cesses. Failure to consider this larger context could lead to the
identification of ‘‘response opportunities,’’ which, if imple-
mented, lead to significant unintended consequences or ‘‘sur-
prise’’ (78, 82–84).k
The vulnerability framework presented here is guided by the
need to provide a template suitable for ‘‘reduced-form’’
analysis yet inclusive of the larger systemic character of the
problem. The framework is not explanatory but provides the
broad classes of components and linkages that comprise a
coupled system’s vulnerability to hazards. The basic architec-
ture (Fig. 3) consists of: (i) linkages to the broader human and
biophysical (environmental) conditions and processes operat-
ing on the coupled system in question; (ii) perturbations and
stressorsstress that emerge from these conditions and pro-
cesses; and (iii) the coupled human–environment system of
concern in which vulnerability resides, including exposure and
responses (i.e., coping, impacts, adjustments, and adapta-
jNarrowly deﬁned, place means location. Place does not imply speciﬁc spatial parameters.
It is a relational term, connoting the existence of larger spatial scales in which the coupled
human–environment system and its location are embedded. Much of the global change
and geographic literature uses at least three terms that imply descending order of spatial
scale: global, regional, and local or place.
kSurprise, strictly interpreted, cannot be anticipated. Much of what passes for surprise
events, however, has been anticipated by someone, as in the case of chloroﬂuorocarbon–
ozone linkages previous to the surprise discovery of the ‘‘ozone hole.’’ Perhaps the more
appropriate issue is that of ‘‘imaginable surprise’’: when the ‘‘event, process, or outcome
departs from the expectations of the observing community or those affected by the event
or process’’ (ref. 84, p. 172). Reducing vulnerability analysis to make it tractable runs the
danger of reducing expectations; thus, the need to remain aware of the larger vulnera-
bility system in which the reduced analysis is undertaken.

tions). These elements are interactive and scale dependent,
such that analysis is affected by the way in which the coupled
system is conceptualized and bounded for study.
The full framework is illustrated in Fig. 3 by way of spatial
scale, linking place (blue) to region (yellow) to globe (green),
and various parts are elaborated in Fig. 4. The coupled
human–environment system, whatever its spatial dimensions,
constitutes the place of analysis. The hazards acting on the
system arise from influences outside and inside the system and
place but, given their complexity and possible nonlinearity, their
precise character is commonly specific to the place-based system.
For these reasons, the hazards themselves are located both
within and beyond the place of assessment. These hazards hold
the potential to affect the coupled system, including the ways in
which the system experiences perturbations and stressors.
The human–environment conditions of the system determine
its sensitivity to any set of exposures. These conditions include
both social and biophysical capital that influences the existing
coping mechanisms, which take effect as the impacts of the
exposure are experienced, as well as those coping mechanisms
adjusted or created because of the experience. For the human
subsystem, these mechanisms may be individual or autonomous
action andor policy-directed changes. Importantly, the social
and biophysical responses or coping mechanisms influence and
feed back to affect each other, so that a response in the human
subsystem could make the biophysical subsystem more or less
able to cope, and vise versa. In some cases, coping mechanisms
per se give way to adaptation, significant system-wide changes in
the human–environment conditions. The responses, whether
autonomous action or planned, public or private, individual or
institutional, tactical or strategic, short- or long-term, anticipa-
tory or reactive in kind, and their outcomes collectively deter-
mine the resilience of the coupled system and may transcend the
system or location of analysis, affecting other scalar dimensions
of the problem with potential feedback of the coupled system in
question.
The framework illustrates the complexity and interactions
involved in vulnerability analysis, drawing attention to the array
of factors and linkages that potentially affect the vulnerability of
the coupled human–environment system in a place. Its systemic
qualities are open to left–right (hazards–consequences) or right–
left (consequences–hazards) application, depending on the in-
terest and aims of the user. As illustrated in the case studies of
Turner et al. (12), however, different vulnerabilities in the system
may be revealed by the direction of the analysis taken.
Vulnerability Analysis for Sustainability
An emerging consensus holds that vulnerability rests largely
within the condition and dynamics of the coupled human–
environment system exposed to hazards, and vulnerability anal-
ysis must be comprehensive, treating not only the system in
question but also its many and varied linkages. Our review of the
literature and experience in developing a vulnerability frame-
work (12) suggest that the usefulness of vulnerability analysis
increases when it:
(i) Directs attention to vulnerability anchored in the condition
of the coupled human–environment system;
(ii) Identifies some of the complexity, interconnectedness, and
iterative nature of the components giving rise to and comprising
vulnerability;
(iii) Illuminates the nested scales of the vulnerability problem
but provides an understanding of the vulnerability of a particular
place;
(iv) Draws attention to the potential dynamics within the
coupled system that give rise to new hazards;
(v) Facilitates the identification of critical interactions in the
human–environment system that suggest response opportunities
for decision makers;
(vi) Is open to the use of both quantitative and qualitative data
and novel methods to derive and analyze information; and
(vii) Assists in the development of metrics, measures, and
models for implementation.

Various initiatives identify the need for robust vulnerability
analysis and, increasingly, sustainability and global change sci-
ence is asked to improve the linkages between the science
problem and decision-making needs (68, 83, 85). Although surely
not complete, this vulnerability framework and the literature and
case studies on which the framework draws, including the
accompanying papers in this issue, suggest the following lessons,
which have direct applicability for vulnerability assessments for
decision making.l
(i) Human and biophysical vulnerability are linked and should
be treated accordingly.
(ii) Beware of one-dimensional vulnerability analyses and be
cognizant of varied components and scalar linkages in the cou-
pled system, which increase the range of expected outcomes.
(iii) Do not assume that broadly similar coupled systems have
the same vulnerabilities; complex dynamics may cause conse-
quences to vary by system or locale.
(iv) Do not assume that all parts of the coupled system have
the same vulnerability; subsystems and components, especially
social units, may experience exposure differently, register dif-
ferent impacts, and maintain different response option.
(v) Although comprehensive vulnerability analysis and place-
based variations in the coupled systems and processes affecting
them favor multiple approaches, vulnerability assessments
should follow a common general methodological framework.
(vi) Critical response opportunities are contingent on the
coupled system or place in question; thus, general guidelines for
response options should be malleable.
(vii) Conscious efforts must be made to create institutional
structures that link vulnerability analyses to decision making.
Vulnerability analysis linked to sustainability requires matu-
ration to better serve various environmental initiatives calling
for increasing attention to the ‘‘so-what’’ questions: the Inter-
national Geosphere–Biosphere Programme, International Hu-
man Dimensions of Global Environmental Change Programme,
Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, and Diversitas, to name a
few. This requirement builds from a rich tradition of past work
toward comprehensive approaches that couple human and bio-
physical subsystems and detail their condition, function, and
linkages to improve understanding of vulnerability and future
projections thereof.
