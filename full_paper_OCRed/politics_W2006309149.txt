Preface and Acknowledgments
from the First Edition
Preface
Although they play a fundamental role in nearly all branches of math-
ematics, inequalities are usually obtained by ad hoc methods rather
than as consequences of some underlying “theory of inequalities.” For
certain kinds of inequalities, the notion of majorization leads to such
a theory that is sometimes extremely useful and powerful for deriv-
ing inequalities. Moreover, the derivation of an inequality by methods
of majorization is often very helpful both for providing a deeper
understanding and for suggesting natural generalizations.
As the 1960s progressed, we became more and more aware of these
facts. Our awareness was reinforced by a series of seminars we gave
while visiting the University of Cambridge in 1967–1968. Because the
ideas associated with majorization deserve to be better known, we
decided by 1970 to write a little monograph on the subject—one that
might have as many as 100 pages—and that was the genesis of this
book.
The idea of majorization is a special case of several more general no-
tions, but these generalizations are mentioned in this book only for the
perspective they provide. We have limited ourselves to various aspects
of majorization partly because we want to emphasize its importance
and partly because its simplicity appeals to us. However, to make the

book reasonably self-contained, ﬁve chapters at the end of the book
are included which contain complementary material.
Because the basic ideas of majorization are elementary, we originally
intended to write a book accessible at least to advanced undergradu-
ate or beginning graduate students. Perhaps to some degree we have
succeeded in this aim with the ﬁrst 10 chapters of the book. Most of
the second 10 chapters involve more sophistication, and there the level
and required background are quite uneven. However, anyone wishing to
employ majorization as a tool in applications can make use of the theo-
rems without studying their proofs; for the most part, their statements
are easily understood.
The book is organized so that it can be used in a variety of ways for
a variety of purposes. Sequential reading is not necessary. Extensive
cross referencing has been attempted so that related material can easily
be found; we hope this will enhance the book’s value as a reference.
For the same purpose, a detailed table of contents and an extensive
index are also provided.
Basic background of interest to all readers is found in Chapters 1
and 4, with Chapter 5 as a reference. See also the Basic Notation and
Terminology immediately following the Acknowledgments.
Technical details concerning majorization are given in Chapters 2
and 3 (especially important are Sections 2.A, 2.B, and 3.A). Added
perspective is given in Chapters 14 and 15.
Analytic inequalities are discussed in Chapter 3 and in Sections
16.A–16.D, with Chapter 6 also of some relevance.
Elementary geometric inequalities are found in Chapter 8.
Combinatorics are discussed primarily in Chapter 7, but Chapters 2,
6, and Section 5.D are also pertinent.
Matrix theory is found especially in Chapters 9 and 10, but also in
Chapters 2, 19, 20, and Sections 16.E and 16.F.
Numerical analysis is found in Chapter 10; Chapters 2 and 9 and
Sections 16.E and 16.F may also be of interest.
Probability and statistics are discussed primarily in Chapters 11–13,
and also in Chapters 15, 17, and 18.
Partly for historical interest, we have tried to give credit to original
authors and to cite their original writings. This policy resulted in a
bibliography of approximately 450 items. Nevertheless, it is surely far
from being complete. As Hardy, Littlewood, and P´olya (1934, 1952)
say in the preface to the ﬁrst edition of their book on inequalities:
Historical and bibliographical questions are particularly
troublesome in a subject like this, which has application in

every part of mathematics but has never been developed
systematically.
It is often really diﬃcult to trace the origin of a familiar
inequality. It is quite likely to occur ﬁrst as an auxiliary
proposition, often without explicit statement, in a memoir
on geometry or astronomy; it may have been rediscovered,
many years later, by half a dozen diﬀerent authors, . . .
We apologize for the inevitable errors of omission or commission that
have been made in giving credits for various results.
Occasionally the proofs provided by original authors have been re-
produced. More often, new proofs are given that follow the central
theme of majorization and build upon earlier results in the book.

The photographs in this book were collected only through the gen-
erosity of a number of people. G. P´olya provided the photos of himself
and of I. Schur. A. Gillespie was instrumental in tracing members of
the family of R. F. Muirhead; photos of him were loaned to us by
W. A. Henderson, and they were expertly restored by John Coury.
Trinity College provided a photo of J. E. Littlewood and a photo of
G. H. Hardy and J. E. Littlewood together. The photos of G. H. Hardy
and H. Dalton were obtained from the Radio Times Hulton Picture
Library, London.
We have been heavily inﬂuenced by the books of Hardy, Littlewood,
and P´olya (1934, 1952), Beckenbach and Bellman (1961), and Mitri-
novi´c (1970); to these authors we owe a debt of gratitude. We are also
indebted to numerous colleagues for comments on various versions of
the manuscript. In addition to many errors that were called to our at-
tention, very signiﬁcant substantive comments were made, enabling us
to considerably improve the manuscript. In particular, we acknowledge
such help from Kumar Jogdeo, Frank Proschan, Robert C. Thompson,
Yung Liang Tong, and Robert A. Wijsman. Koon-Wing Cheng was es-
pecially helpful with Chapters 2 and 3, and Michael D. Perlman gave
us insightful comments about Chapters 11 and 12. Moshe Shaked read
a number of drafts and contributed both critical comments and bibli-
ographic material over a period of several years. Perceptive comments
about several chapters were made by Tom Snijders; in particular,
Chapter 17 would not have been written in its present form without
his comments. Friedrich Pukelsheim read nearly all of the manuscript;
his meticulously detailed comments were invaluable to us.

History and Preface of the
Second Edition
History
Preparation of the ﬁrst edition of this book, published in 1979, began in
1967–1968 while AWM and IO were visiting the Statistical Laboratory
in Cambridge, England. From 1968 to 1979, we were fortunate to have
many opportunities to visit each other: the summer of 1977 at Imperial
College, London; three months at ETH in Zurich; and a number of
times at Stanford University. With this background of commitment for
the ﬁrst edition, it was clear to both of us that an appropriate revision
would be a major commitment that we were reluctant to consider
undertaking alone. Fortunately, we had the wisdom to invite Barry
Arnold to join us. Without his diligence, knowledge, and sustained
eﬀorts, this revision would not exist. We suspect that he was duped
(probably by us) into thinking that the revision would move along
quickly. This has not been the case, and we can only thank him for
persevering until the end.

History and Preface of the Second Edition
Preface
The large number of appearances of majorization in so many diﬀerent
ﬁelds of application over the last 25 years has been a pleasant surprise.
One of the early origins of majorization is in comparisons of income
inequality. Because inequality appears in many guises in physics, chem-
istry, political science, engineering, economics and so on, perhaps the
plethora of applications should not be surprising. In any case, since
1979 when the ﬁrst edition appeared, many new applications of the
majorization ordering have appeared. This revision attempts to bring
these uses to the fore so that the reader can see the extent and vari-
ation in its use, thereby perhaps ﬁnding it helpful in his or her own
research.
A key feature of the ﬁrst edition was the use of majorization to
obtain new proofs and generalizations of known results. Since the ap-
pearance of the ﬁrst edition, many new results have been obtained
that already use a majorization argument. In general, such results are
included in this edition without proof. Consequently, the reader may
need to check the referenced sources for proofs.
The chapters of the original version remain intact; additions ap-
pear within the text and as supplements at the end of chapters. The
bibliography has increased by over 50%. A new, large addition is the
discussion of Lorenz curves.
The authors are grateful to numerous readers of the ﬁrst edition for
their concern and help in uncovering and correcting errors. Readers
are urged to bring to our attention any errors found in the current
version.
We are especially grateful to James Bondar (1994) for his article
“Comments and complements to Inequalities”. This paper, written
15 years after the appearance of the ﬁrst edition, provides a ret-
rospective view of majorization, and a clariﬁcation of some of the
concepts. His section on complements adds some new material. An Er-
rata Appendix helped the authors to prepare this new edition. Finally,
we thank him for his help in the discussion of converse theorems in
Section 9.G.
To enhance the usefulness of the book, we have taken special care to
make it easy to ﬁnd particular results. Deﬁnitions have been provided.
Numerous headings have been included, as well as a detailed table of
contents and listing of the basic notation used. The subject index is
expanded with permuted entries, which should help in a search. At
times the author index can also help in locating facts.

We are indebted to Slobodanka Jankowi´c for supplying the photo-
graph of Jovan Karamata, and to Martin Jacobsen for uncovering a
photo of J. W. V. Jensen. Thanks to Bo Lindgren for his help with
the biography of Jensen.
We thank Peggy Franklin for her heroic transcription of some noto-
riously illegible handwriting into a clear typescript, and for patiently
dealing with a semi-inﬁnite number of revisions. Thanks to Carole
Arnold for editorial advice and assistance, especially with many of
the references. Thanks to Linda Yamamota for her library help, in
particular with the many searches.
We thank the anonymous reviewers who made helpful comments
and helped us correct errors in the ﬁnal drafts of this second edition.
Pietro Cerone also provided helpful suggestions for improvement.
A special thanks to our Springer editor, John Kimmel, who has gone
to great lengths to help this revision come to fruition.

Overview and Roadmap
There are several ways to characterize the ordering of majorization,
each one of which leads to a variety of results. Inevitably, there are
loops or repetitions in this monograph; the material does not lend itself
naturally to the linear organization forced upon it by the structure of
a book. There are several ways that the material could be organized,
and there are several routes to a study of the subject.
Chapter 1 oﬀers an overview of basic results. Chapter 2 discusses
the connection with doubly stochastic matrices and oﬀers important
insight into the geometry of majorization. Chapter 3 discusses Schur-
convex functions; these are the functions that preserve the ordering of
majorization, and it is through them that many inequalities emerge.
Chapters 4, 5, and 6 oﬀer equivalent conditions for majorization
and show some ways that the ordering can arise. These six chapters
constitute Part I of the book.
Beyond Part I, the reader should feel free to jump in almost any-
where. We have taken care to include references to various parts of the
book that may be relevant to a speciﬁc topic; these references may ask
the reader to jump ahead as well as back in the book.
George P´olya, who was not only a great mathematician, but also a
great expositor, made the point that one who only can generalize is
like a monkey who can only climb up a tree, and one who can only

Overview and Roadmap
specialize is like a monkey who can only climb down. P´olya urged
mathematicians to look for generality behind the particular case, to
look for signiﬁcant particular cases in the general statement. With
this in mind and the recognition that diﬀerent ﬁelds of application
need diﬀerent special cases and diﬀerent generalizations, this book
contains what one reviewer called a “blizzard of results”. (It was not a
tsunami, but only a blizzard.) The inclusion of so many special cases
was by design to help the researcher ﬁnd both particular results and
generalizations.
The

relate

(Combinatorial Analysis, Geometric Inequalities, Matrix Theory, and
Numerical Analysis). Stochastic applications are given in Part III.
Various generalizations of majorization are discussed in Part IV
(Chapters 14 and 15).
To make the book as complete as possible and to avoid sending the
reader to other sources, the complementary topics of convex functions
and classical inequalities (Chapter 16), stochastic ordering (Chapter
17), total positivity (Chapter 18), matrix factorization, compounds,
direct products and M-matrices (Chapter 19), and extremal represen-
tations of matrix functions (Chapter 20) together are included. These
together constitute Part V of the book.

Basic Notation and Terminology
Interchapter cross references include the chapter number as a preﬁx.
Cross references within a chapter do not have this preﬁx.
The following notation is used throughout this book. It is given here
in tabular form for easy reference.
R = (−∞, ∞),
R+ = [0, ∞),
R++ = (0, ∞),
Rn = {(x1, . . . , xn) : xi ∈R for all i},
Rn
+ = {(x1, . . . , xn) : xi ≥0 for all i},
Rn
++ = {(x1, . . . , xn) : xi > 0 for all i},
D = {(x1, . . . , xn) : xi ≥· · · ≥xn},
D+ = {(x1, . . . , xn) : xi ≥· · · ≥xn ≥0},
D++ = {(x1, . . . , xn) : xi ≥· · · ≥xn > 0}.

Basic Notation and Terminology
Throughout this book, increasing means nondecreasing and decreas-
ing means nonincreasing. Thus if f : R →R, f is
increasing
if x ≤y ⇒f(x) ≤f(y),
strictly increasing
if x < y ⇒f(x) < f(y),
decreasing
if x ≤y ⇒f(x) ≥f(y),
strictly decreasing
if x < y ⇒f(x) > f(y).
For typographic simplicity, any vector x is a row vector, and x′ is
its transpose.
For any x = (x1, . . . , xn) ∈Rn, let
x[1] ≥· · · ≥x[n]
denote the components of x in decreasing order, and let
x↓= (x[1], . . . , x[n])
denote the decreasing rearrangement of x.
Similarly, let
x(1) ≤· · · ≤x(n)
denote the components of x in increasing order, and let
x↑= (x(1), . . . , x(n))
denote the increasing rearrangement of x.
The vector with ith component 1 and all other components 0 is
denoted by ei, and the vector with all components 1 is denoted by e.
The elementwise vector ordering xi ≤yi, i = 1, . . . , n, is denoted by
x ≤y.
For matrices A and B, the direct sum is denoted by
A ⊕B =
A
0
0
B

.
For matrices A and B conformable for multiplication, write
⟨A, B⟩= Σaijbij = tr AB′.

A > 0 (A ≥0) denotes that A is positive deﬁnite (semideﬁnite).
A > B (A ≥B) means that A −B > 0 (A −B ≥0).
For A = (aij),
B = (bij),
A ◦B = (aijbij).
Eigenvalues are generally denoted by λ, and are ordered
λ1 ≥· · · ≥λn, unless otherwise noted.

Behind every theorem lies an inequality.
Attributed to A.N. Kolmogorov
Inequalities play a role in most branches of mathematics
and have widely diﬀerent applications.
