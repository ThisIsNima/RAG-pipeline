with
catchy
titles, committee
reports are unlikely bestsellers. This
one has the background and inten-
tion to be different. The committee mem-
bers,
who
were
appointed
by
the
US
National Academy of Science for their crea-
tive thinking and knowledge of medicine,
healthcare, and commerce, provide excel-
lently researched evidence for the failure of
the
US
healthcare
system. They
justify
radical change and establish six aims and 10
simple rules for a completely different
healthcare system. They call for a common
purpose and as few simple rules as possible,
based on a complex adaptive system model,
and they contrast this with the current
bureaucratic attempts to regulate problems
created by the system itself.
The report explores the development of
information
technology,
arguing
that
human brains should be reserved for judg-
ments that are too complex for computers
rather than for feats of memory. Brief case
descriptions develop a powerful vision of
what it might be like to experience this new
healthcare. Although the authors don’t go
into the detail that would in reality have to
be developed between those providing and
receiving care, the vision is strong and
convincing.
There are two major obstacles to the
vision, and the book addresses both of these.
The first is cost; the second—professionals’
attachment to their current culture, roles,
and
professional
identity—is
probably
harder to overcome. The authors argue that
the present system is so wasteful that a new
system could not fail to be more economic.
Costs—including compensation for medical
errors—are out of control. On all counts, the
system is failing and there is no choice but
change.
This report will influence healthcare
policy makers throughout the world for at
least the next 10 years. The NHS could be a
more receptive environment for the vision
than the US healthcare system. Even the
section on funding applies to the United
Kingdom. Already, government pronounce-
ments on the NHS, on change, and on
quality, and much of the work of healthcare
think tank the King’s Fund reflect the vision
outlined in this report.
But will this be a bestseller? It deserves to
be. It is relatively easy to read and is manda-
tory for anyone who has any interest in the
future of healthcare or who wishes to under-
stand the direction of current developments
for quality, such as clinical governance. It
also serves as a handbook for personal
development and reflective practice. I sug-
gest that the willingness of the workforce to
embrace its ideas is crucial to the survival of
the UK health service, so sales of this book
could be a prognostic indicator for the NHS.
Buy it and read it.
Alastair Baker consultant paediatric hepatologist,
King’s College Hospital, London
I
n 1984 Professor Andreasen published
a book called The Broken Brain: The Bio-
logical
Revolution
in
Psychiatry.
This
influenced many latter day psychiatrists
(myself
included).
Now
Andreasen
has
produced a work in which she attempts to
assay the field of contemporary psychiatric
research, as
psychiatry
enters
the
21st
century, sandwiched between two major
technological developments: the sequencing
of the human genome and the use of
neuroimaging to examine the structure and
function of the living brain.
Is there a need for such a work? Are we
not
already
deluged
by
brain
books?
Certainly,
if
there
were
a
need
then
Andreasen would be a suitable guide. She is
editor of the American Journal of Psychiatry,
has contributed to the composition of the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, has made significant contributions
to the field of schizophrenia research, has
studied the relationship between creativity
and mental illness scientifically, and has also
published early work on post-traumatic
stress
disorder
(before
it
acquired
that
name). So, on
all
levels
she
is
amply
qualified. But do we need another book?
This book differs from others in that it is
written by someone who has conducted
original research, while continuing to treat
patients. Andreasen can write scientifically,
while also addressing the concerns of lay
people. Many of the chapters begin with
case vignettes (some of them very moving)
and
throughout
Andreasen
see-saws
between cogent descriptions of scientific
concepts and reference points that all will
understand—a film that deals with schizo-
phrenia,
a
novel
whose
character
was
depressed, and so on. This is a detailed text,
not a coffee table book. It explains the prin-
ciples of the new genetics, the anatomy of
neurotransmitter systems, and the method-
ology of brain scanning. In four chapters
devoted to diseases, Andreasen explains
schizophrenia, mood disorders, dementia,
and anxiety. She does not shirk ethical
dilemmas and possesses a humane voice.
Where are the weaknesses? As with any
book that attempts to cover a broad field,
some infelicities occur. These are probably
slips of the pen: the putamen lies lateral and
not medial to the globus pallidus (p 73);
reduced not elevated serotonergic tone is
associated with impulsivity and suicide (p
311); and in the index, the name of one Brit-
ish psychiatrist is left floating, with no page
attribution (obsessives will find Johnstone,
Eve, on p 143). Elsewhere, the balance of
Andreasen’s expertise is clearly present in
the schizophrenia chapter, while that on
dementia lacks the same degree of detail.
However, these are minor points. I think a
lay reader, a medical student, or a generalist
who wishes to update on current psychiatry
will find much that is useful and inspiring in
Brave New Brain.

T
his is a study in political correctness.
It takes a comfortable global view
and forecasts that humanity, having
passed the six billion point two years ago, is
now heading for nine billion by 2050—a
year which many readers can expect to see.
A report issued this month by the United
Nations Population Fund predicted that the
world’s population would reach 9.3 billion
by 2050 (BMJ 2001;323:1088). Other recent
studies show the world’s population growing
more slowly and reaching nine billion only
in 2070. It was only two billion when I was
born. Nearly as much growth will take place
in the next 50 years as took place in the last
50. Whereas the populations of industrial
countries are now outnumbered four to one,
they will be outnumbered seven to one by
2050. More than half the population growth
will
be
accounted
for
by
“population
momentum.” This is the inevitable growth in
a young population that would take place if
every family were to have two children
(strictly 2.1) from now on. It can only be
reduced if families of less than two children
become the norm in rapidly growing popu-
lations.
If the global view is hardly reassuring,
the local view is too terrifying for this book
to contemplate. It fails to consider the plight
of agricultural communities that outgrow
the carrying capacity of their local ecosys-
tems and have no new land to migrate to,
and have economies that fail to provide suf-
ficient exports, which they can exchange for
food and other essentials—that is, they are
demographically trapped. I once asked Jack
Caldwell, Africa’s most eminent demogra-
pher, how much of Africa he thinks is
trapped. He replied that he thinks most of it
is. Africa has been a net food importer for 20
years. Its population was set to quadruple
before AIDS, and even now it is set nearly to
triple. The end result of entrapment is
starvation and population driven violence.
Not only does this book fail to confront
entrapment, but demography and develop-
ment economics don’t do so either. All must
therefore
be
considered
intellectually
corrupt—subject to the Hardinian taboo
(named
after
the
US
ecologist
Garrett
Hardin) that prevents us humans—with the
exception of China with its one child
families—from confronting our population
problems.
This book is a reminder, not so much to
read between the lines, as to look over the
edge of the population precipice and to steel
ourselves for what is going to happen. For
more about this, readers are going to have to
ask
their
search
engines
to
look
for
disentrapment on the web.
Beyond Six Billion looks so impressive—a
shiny hardback sponsored by the four US
National Academies, and written by the
most eminent politically correct “yes men”
that it was possible to gather round a table,
all of whom presumably know what the real
situation is. They appear to have got it right
globally, but they have ignored the problem
locally. They have persuaded the reader that
all is well, when in fact all is far from well.
Maurice King honorary research fellow, the
University of Leeds
Do we need another
anthrax test?
R
esearchers at the Mayo Clinic have
unveiled a new test for anthrax “that
can spot the microbe’s DNA signa-
ture within 35 minutes,” the San Francisco
Chronicle reported on 6 November. The
“unveiling” excited the rest of the US media,
and why shouldn’t it, for a new and rapid
way of diagnosing this deadly disease must
surely be a triumph?
The lead researcher, Franklin Cockerill,
did his best to persuade journalists at a press
conference last week that the discovery was
indeed a breakthrough. The rapid test, he
said, will allow for speedier treatment of
people exposed to anthrax. It will also “alle-
viate undue anxiety more quickly in people
who have not been exposed.”
The researchers, funded by Roche Diag-
nostics, were working on the test before
11 September, but it was not a high priority.
After the terrorist attacks, explained Dr
Cockerill, they spent “25 hours a day, seven
days a week” on its development. Roche has
distributed
the
test
to
24
laboratories
around the country, initially free of charge,
and hopes to get expedited approval for its
product from the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration.
But why is Roche in such a hurry? The
Centers for Disease Control already has a
test for anthrax DNA that is remarkably
similar to the “new” one. Both use the
polymerase chain reaction in which DNA
is multiplied to make it easier to identify.
The New York Times (8 November) pointed
out that a rival drug company, Cepheid,
had been selling “a quick DNA test for
anthrax” since
May
2000. Other
com-
panies are racing to offer similar commer-
cial tests.
The Chronicle claimed that public health
authorities were unimpressed with Roche’s
test, which still hadn’t been evaluated in a
clinical
setting,
only
in
the
laboratory.
California’s medical officer, Michael Aschler,
told the paper that there was no need for a
new test, while the Centers for Disease Con-
trol had failed to endorse any commercial
test for anthrax.
With anthrax fear spreading across the
United States, did Roche merely spot an
opportunity to market its test? Of course
not, says the company. Dennis Coverdale,
vice president of corporate relations, said:
“We as a company hope the anthrax threats
go away tomorrow.”
So Roche will provide the test free of
charge over the long term? “Probably not,”
he said, but “we haven’t decided what we will
do with pricing.”
Online sites have seized on public fear to
sell “anthrax medications and survival kits”
(BMJ 2001;323:942). The tactic seems to be
working—over 32 000 Americans in Florida,
New York City, and Washington DC have
taken antibiotics through fear of having
been exposed to the disease (Washington
Post, 11 September). Roche’s test received
huge US media coverage, and it is easy to
imagine a scenario in which thousands of
worried people demand the test to alleviate
their anxiety. Roche says it is just trying to
help those in the front lines do their
job—but when the company starts charging
for the test, such help will only come at a
price.

vCJD: health risks
and health scares
Panorama: “Coming Clean,” BBC 1,
11 November at 10 15 pm
W
hat a programme making dream
this
must
have
been
for
the
Panorama crew. It featured a fatal
disease,
a
government
scientist
turned
whistleblower, a buried report, and a set of
surgical instruments locked in a hospital attic.
The disease was variant Creutzfeldt-
Jakob disease, an illness with a complex and
turbulent history, and now thought to be
transmissible through the reuse of contami-
nated surgical instruments. The whistle-
blower was the government microbiologist
Dr David Hurrell, who audited the country’s
surgical equipment cleaning procedures,
and told all to Panorama. The buried report
showed that there were “serious flaws” and
“barely adequate” procedures in most hospi-
tals. When NHS executives received the
report, it was suddenly classified as “strictly
confidential,” and Dr Hurrell was told to
destroy all copies. The surgical instruments
locked in a Nuneaton hospital attic were
used on a patient who then developed vCJD.
Once the disease had been diagnosed, the
instruments were traced, and are kept in a
room to which only one person has the key.
The programme was certainly dramatic,
and engaging. It concentrated on the life-
cycle of the report, from commissioning to
extinction (“the survey that didn’t happen,”
as it is called in government circles). We were
fed sequences of cars being driven around in
fog, and interviews with the report author
crouched in the back of a London cab. Did
someone say Crimewatch?
Was
this
a
programme
aimed
to
heighten public awareness of an important
health issue or another case of media scare-
mongering?
Respondents
to
Panorama’s
website (www.bbc.co.uk/panorama) mostly
thanked the programme for lifting the lid on
the
“cover
up”
but
others
found
the
programme alarmist, and criticised it for
leaving no support information.
The government said the report had a
“negative outcome,” and for this reason did
not want it to be released into the public
domain.
But
the
programme
did
not
explore what exactly the “negative outcome”
was. Was the government worried that poor
hospital cleaning procedures could pose a
serious risk of transmitting vCJD or was it
worried that a minimal health risk could
provoke unnecessary public anxiety?
Essentially this was a programme about
health risk, but Panorama shied away from
examining how much information about
health risk should be publicly available. The
public, the programme said, want to be
treated as “adults” and kept fully informed.
Yet we know that people find it hard to
understand
risk
and
deal
badly
with
uncertainty, even though the government
and medical profession generally advocate
openness
and
transparency.
The
pro-
gramme featured a man with haemophilia
recounting his distress at receiving a letter
that
said
that
he
had
received
blood
products from someone who had later
developed vCJD. His wife asked him if that
meant he was going to die. The camera
repeatedly focused on him smoking and
cradling a roll up between his fingers—was
this meant to be a cliché representation of
his anxiety or was Panorama not aware of the
irony of the shots? The man’s risk of death
from vCJD cannot compare to his risk of
death from lung cancer.
Dramatic presentation diluted the scien-
tific facts of this important and poorly
understood disease. We were told that there
had been no cases of vCJD from surgical
instruments or blood products. Also we
heard that research on mice brains—due to
be published last week by Professor John
Collinge of Imperial College, London—
would show that metal wires contaminated
with vCJD can infect another animal brain
after only half an hour’s contact. Professor
James Ironside, of the CJD Surveillance
Unit, told the programme that transmission
was “no longer theoretical and is a real risk.”
But there was little to inform the public on
the degree of this risk. Almost a year ago the
government announced an extra £200m for
sterilising surgical instruments to minimise
the risk of passing on vCJD during certain
operations and gave advice about reducing
risk by disposing of surgical instruments and
using single use instruments after tonsillec-
tomies.
It
would
have
been
useful
to
examine whether advice and money had
changed practice.
Doctors are rightly encouraged to share
information with the public, but a good doc-
tor develops intuition to know how and what
information to provide. It is hard to know
whether Panorama should be criticised for
provoking public anxiety or praised for
airing a difficult issue. Perhaps we’ll get the
answer to that in our surgeries and clinics
over the next few weeks, when patients ask
us about the risk, and whether or not to go
ahead with their operations.

Pet bereavement In this week’s Soundings (p 1195), Trisha Greenhalgh
describes the emotional consequences of losing a pet. Doctors often have to
help patients who have suffered a loss, but what can they offer beyond the
normal constraints of bereavement support and counselling? Is there
something specific for those who have lost pets and need help to manage their
grieving?
In Memory of Pets (www.in-memory-of-pets.com) is a professional looking
site, adorned with thumbnail pictures of angel cats and dogs, winging their way
to heaven. As “one of only a few free and permanent pet loss and grief support
sites on the internet,” it is making a concerted effort to help take the grieving
process to its latter stages: daily and annual commemorative ceremonies. Now it
is possible to join thousands of bereaved pet owners across the globe in a
rosebud lined, candlelit vigil in honour of pets past and present.
The curiously named Lightning Strike (is it sudden death or a rapid
support service?) “pet-loss support page” aims to provide everything a grieving
pet person could want (www.lightning-strike.com). Post a message to tell the
world how wonderful Fluffy was. Chat to other lost souls who have been
through the same thing. The site is just a touch saccharine and, for those
bursting to express their feelings through art, there is a section dedicated to
poems commemorating those furry friends that have progressed to the
afterlife.
Though it lacks the gloss and lustre of more professional sites, perhaps
Lightning Strike offers the better “cybershoulder to cry on.” It lets you send a
“Pet loss postcard” to offer your condolences to the recently bereaved. What
better way to show that you care?
Of course, these sites aren’t for everyone; some patients may feel that you
aren’t taking them seriously. The Association for Pet Loss and Bereavement
(www.aplb.org) can help. It is a non profit organisation dedicated to supporting
those who have lost a “beloved companion animal.” APLB was founded by
professionals and provides publicity, literature, tapes, and counselling for those
who are dramatically affected by the death of their pet.

PERSONAL VIEW
Stuck in the middle?
I
have just emerged from three years
stuck between the medical profession
and NHS managers on one side and the
public, the media, and local politicians on
the other. The only issue was whether or not
the NHS could continue to run a blue light
accident and emergency department at Kid-
derminster Hospital, one of the smallest dis-
trict general hospitals in the country, with no
paediatric department and just a single con-
sultant in emergency medicine.
I was the local member of parliament, a
government minister, and the husband of a
general practitioner. What could an MP do in
these circumstances? Well there were only
two choices—either back the
changes recommended by
professionals or back a futile,
misguided but popular (and
populist) campaign against
them. No MP could try to sit
in the middle of this storm.
Arguments for scaling
down
the
emergency
department to a minor inju-
ries unit were overwhelming.
The local consultants said
that the department wasn’t safe and the
King’s Fund, brought in by the campaign, said
it wasn’t viable. Local GPs, alienated by how
insensitively the health authority handled the
case for change, at first kept their heads down.
When they finally went public with their sup-
port for the changes, local people simply dis-
believed them. “It’s a case of patients against
doctors; someone has to stand up for the
NHS,” a fervent woman said to me. I took the
view that, unfortunate as it was, change was
inevitable. The health authority didn’t make
the case for change very competently, but
basically it was medically right.
What effect did all this have on me? Well,
working as an MP became impossible and it
led to my defeat at the General Election.
Local people, whipped up into a state of
high emotion, felt justified in abusing me
while I was out shopping, pushing my
children in the park, or attending a local
football match. They complained that I did
not understand local feeling. They claimed
that I was just following the party line or that
ministerial office had bought me off (which
to anyone involved in Westminster is clearly
nonsense). Eventually I was accused of being
singlehandedly
responsible
for
nothing
short of mass murder. For three years I felt
as if I was under siege.
It was not without its ironic moments.
For example, someone who thought he was
going to die as a result of having “his”
accident and emergency department taken
away from him slammed a door in my face.
At that moment, my mobile went off. It was
the president of a Royal College who called
to say he was appalled about the turn of
events and wanted to offer every support.
Am I glad it’s over? You bet. Defeat was
hard but not as hard as what went before.
Life is more peaceful now. I have an anony-
mous life again and my children have their
dad back.
How do I feel about it now? Well I don’t
blame the medics. They were right to follow
the advice of their Royal Colleges, the King’s
Fund, and every other independent body
that looked into the situation. When Profes-
sor Robert Winston came to Kidderminster
and tried to explain how what was going on
was precisely right, the local media dis-
missed his views. Lord Winston might be
one of the world’s leading doctors, the cam-
paign complained, but what
did he know about Kidder-
minster!
What will happen now?
Well, the extra services for
Kidderminster for which I
argued while an MP are
coming following a Royal
College
inquiry.
Has
my
opponent, Richard Taylor, a
retired doctor and now the
MP, produced a plan to
bring back blue light accident and emer-
gency, the one issue on which he was
elected? No, of course not, and health minis-
ters say that he has no plans to do so. If there
were a way to bring it back, Dr Taylor would
have explained how to do it long ago.
Where does this leave local people?
Well, like the Duke of York’s army, they’ve
been marched up the hill and down again.
They’ve
been
told
that
in
losing
their
emergency department, a great wrong has
been done to them and that their lives are in
danger. The local paper has repeated this
claim week after week.
Where does this leave structural change
in the NHS? That’s the real question. I’m a
lawyer and so had a career to return to. Los-
ing my seat was a disappointment but not a
disaster.
Other
politicians,
learning
the
lessons from Kidderminster, may think twice
before opposing any campaign against a
change in medical services, however essen-
tial. Local medics don’t see it as their job to
sell change in the NHS to the public, and
who can blame them? They are busy, pressu-
rised, and most have no allegiance to the
government or their local health authorities.
That leaves a vacuum—whose job is it to
face
down
public
anger?
The
Bristol
children’s heart surgery saga shows that out-
wardly
popular
but
dangerous
services
simply
cannot
be
allowed
to
continue.
Unfortunately I cannot see there being
many recruits for the job of being vilified as
public
messenger
for
essential
NHS
changes. We will all be the losers.

SOUNDINGS
Critical event audit
I noticed the previous evening that she
wasn’t her usual lively self, but it was still
a shock to discover her curled up, stiff
and cold, the next morning. The children
immediately attempted post hoc
resuscitation by generously refilling her
food tray. But to an experienced eye,
there was no denying the clinical reality.
Smokey Bin Hamster was no more.
Their next reaction was to stage a
cover up. Don’t tell the cleaner, they
insisted. Their ill formed plan was to
leave the dead creature curled up in her
cage, shifting her position daily, and to
walk past occasionally within the
cleaner’s earshot saying, “Gosh, Smokey’s
asleep again.”
This plan was soon seen to be
untenable, and our communal guilt
surfaced. We started to trade indictments.
Who had tried to see if she would eat
cold chips two days before she died?
Who had tied a conker to the roof of the
cage? Who had first abandoned the rota
for cleaning her out? Who had walked
her along the piano keys? Whose friends
had all had a go at Pokey Smokey?
One of the kids decided that she had
died of depression. He had been the only
one who had ever understood her
feelings. The rest of us, he claimed, had
taken her for granted. Rubbish, I said,
the culprit was Bart Simpson. It said in
the guidelines (“Caring for your
hamster”) that you shouldn’t keep them
near the television, especially loud and
violent programmes. If you kids hadn’t
kept playing that bloody video she would
still be alive.
In the silence following the row, I
regretted my outburst and reflected on
the blame culture that we had allowed to
develop. The hamster could not be
brought back, but the event should be
seen as a learning experience, and
processes put in place to prevent a
similar disaster in the future. I found it
hard to admit, even to myself, that I’d
never read the guidelines properly, nor
had I arranged appropriate training for
the principal carer. Lines of
accountability were unclear, and, worst of
all, the crucial task of changing the water
was either everybody’s or nobody’s job.
One week on, we are still slightly
numb from the event, but we have all
learnt a lot and we now have an evidence
based care pathway in place with
essential roles assigned to named
individuals who are appropriately
trained and supervised. And six days on,
young Ginger is still the picture of
health.
