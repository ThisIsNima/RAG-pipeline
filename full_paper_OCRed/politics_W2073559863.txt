Transformational 
leaders inspire, energize, and intellectually stimulate their 
employees. The author argues that through training, managers can learn 
the techniques and obtain the qualities they need to become 
transformational 
leaders.

fame liked to tell a story about one of 
Captain Robert Falcon Scott’s earlier at- 
tempts, from 1901 to 1904, to reach the South 
Pole. Scott led an expedition made up of men 
from the Royal Navy and the merchant ma- 
rine, as well as a group of scientists. Scott had 
considerable 
trouble 
dealing with 
the mer- 
chant marine personnel, who were unaccus- 
tomed to the rigid discipline of Scott’s Royal 
Navy. Scott wanted to send one seaman home 
because he would not take orders, but the sea- 
man refused, arguing that he had signed a 
contract and knew his rights. Since the sea- 
man was not subject to Royal Navy discipli- 
nary action, Scott did not know what to do. 
Then Ernest Shackleton, a merchant navy of- 
ficer in Scott’s party, calmly informed the sea- 
man that he, the seaman, was returning 
to 
Britain. 
Again 
the 
seaman 
refused- 
and 
Shackleton knocked him to the ship’s deck. 
After another 
refusal, followed 
by a second 
flooring, the seaman decided he would return 
home. Scott later became one of the victims 
of his own inadequacies as a leader in his 1911 
race to the South Pole. Shackleton went on 
to lead many memorable 
expeditions; 
once, 
seeking help for the rest of his party, who 
were stranded 
on the Antarctic 
Coast, he 
journeyed with a small crew in a small open 
boat from the edge of Antarctica 
to South 
Georgia Island. 
LEADERSHIP TODAY 
Most relationships between supervi- 
sors and their employees are quite different 
today, Few managers depend mainly on their 
legitimate 
power, 
as Scott did, or on their 
coercive power, 
as Shackleton 
did, to per- 
suade people to do as they’re told. Rather, 
managers engage in a transaction with their 
employees: They explain what is required of

them and what compensation 
they will re- 
ceive if they fulfill these requirements. 
A shift in management 
style at Xerox’s 
Reprographic 
Business Group 
(RBG) pro- 
vides a good example. In the first step toward 
establishing management 
in which managers 
take the initiative and show consideration for 
others, 44 specific, effective management 
be- 
haviors were identified. Two factors that char- 
acterize modern 
leadership 
were found 
in 
many of these behaviors. One factor - initial- 
ing and organizing work-concentrates 
on ac- 
complishing 
the tasks at hand. The second 
factor-showing 
consideration 
for employ- 
ees - focuses on satisfying the self-interest of 
those who do good work. 
The leader gets 
things done by making, and fulfilling, 
prom- 
ises of recognition, 
pay increases, and ad- 
vancement for employees who perform well. 
By contrast, employees who do not do good 
work are penalized. This transaction 
or ex- 
change-this 
promise and reward for good per- 
formance, 
or threat and discipline for poor 
performance -characterizes 
effective leader- 
ship. These kinds of transactions took place 
in most of the effective 44 leadership 
be- 
haviors identified 
at Xerox’s RBG. This kind 
of leadership, which is based on transactions 
between manager 
and employees, is called 
“transactional 
leadership.” 
In many instances, however, such trans- 
actional leadership is a prescription 
for medi- 
ocrity. This is particularly 
true if the leader 
relies heavily on passive management-by-ex- 
ception, 
intervening 
with his or her group 
only when procedures and standards for ac- 
complishing tasks are not being met. My col- 
leagues and I have arrived at this surprising 
but consistent finding in a number of research 
analyses. Such a manager espouses the popu- 
lar adage, “If it ain’t broken, don’t fix it.” He 
or she stands in back of the caboose of a mov- 
ing freight train and says, “Now I know where 
we are going.” This kind of manager may use 


----- Page 3 (native text) -----
disciplinary 
threats to bring a group’s perfor- 
mance up to standards -a 
technique that is 
ineffective and, in the long run, likely to be 
counterproductive. 
Moreover, 
whether 
the promise 
of re- 
wards or the avoidance of penalties motivates 
the employees depends on whether the leader 
has control of the rewards or penalties, and 
on whether the employees want the rewards 
or fear the penalties. In many organizations, 
pay increases depend mainly 
on seniority, 
and promotions 
depend on qualifications 
and 
policies about which the leader has little to 
say. The breaking of regulations 
may be the 
main cause of penalties. Many an executive 
has found his or her hands tied by contract 
provisions, 
organizational 
politics, 
and in- 
adequate resources. 
TRANSFORMATIONAL 
LEADERSHIP 
Superior leadership performance - trans- 
formational 
leadership - occurs when leaders 
broaden and elevate the interests of their em- 
ployees, when they generate awareness and 
acceptance of the purposes and mission of the 
group, and when they stir their employees to 
look beyond their own self-interest for the 
good of the group. Transformational 
leaders 
achieve these results in one or more ways: 
They may be charismatic 
to their followers 
and thus inspire them; they may meet the 
emotional 
needs of each employee; 
and/or 
they may intellectually 
stimulate employees. 
Exhibit 1 lists the characteristics of transfor- 
mational 
and transactional 
leadership; these 
listings are based on the findings of a series 
of surveys and on clinical and case evidence. 
Attaining 
charisma in the eyes of one’s 
employees is central to succeeding as a trans- 
formational 
leader. Charismatic 
leaders have 
great power and influence. 
Employees want 
to identify 
with them, and they have a high 
degree of trust and confidence in them. Char- 
ismatic leaders inspire and excite their em- 
ployees with the idea that they may be able 
to accomplish great things with extra effort. 
Further, transformational 
leaders are individ- 
ually considerate, that is, they pay close atten- 
tion to differences among their employees; 
they act as mentors to those who need help 
to grow and develop. Intellectual 
stimulation 
of employees is a third factor in transforma- 
tional 
leadership. 
Intellectually 
stimulating 
leaders are willing and able to show their em- 
ployees new ways of looking at old problems, 
to teach them to see difficulties 
as problems 
to be solved, and to emphasize rational solu- 
tions. Such a leader was Iorenz 
Iversen, a 
former president of the Mesta Machine Com- 
pany, who said to his employees, “We got this 
job because you’re the best mechanics in the 
world!” 
He practiced management-by-walk- 
ing-around 
and stimulated 
the development 
of many of Mesta’s patented inventions. He is 
remembered for instilling pride and commit- 
ment in his employees. 
THE BIG PAYOFF 
Managers who behave like transforma- 
tional leaders are more likely to be seen by 
their colleagues and employees as satisfying 
and effective leaders than are those who be- 
have like transactional 
leaders, according to 
their colleagues’, supervisors: and employees’ 
responses on the Multifactor 
Leadership Ques- 
tionnaire 
(MLQ). 
Similar results have been 
found in various organizational 
settings. Lead- 
ers studied have come from 
an extremely 
broad variety of organizations: chief executive 
officers and senior and middle level managers 
in business and industrial firms in the United 
States, Canada, 
Japan, and India; 
research 
and development 
project leaders; American, 
Canadian, and British Army field grade offi-

CHARACTERISTICS OF TRANSFORMATIONAL AND TRANSACTIONAL LEADERS 
TRANSFORMATIONAL 
LEADER 
Charisma: 
Provides vision and sense of mission, instills pride, gains respect and trust. 
Inspiration: 
Communicates 
high expectations, 
uses symbols 
to focus efforts, expresses important 
purposes 
in simple ways. 
Intellectual 
Stimulation: 
Promotes intelligence, rationality, and careful problem solving. 
Individualized 
Consideration: 
Gives personal 
attention, 
treats each employee 
individually, 
coaches, advises. 
TRANSACTIONAL 
LEADER 
Contingent 
Reward: 
Contracts exchange of rewards for effort, promises rewards for good performance, 
recognizes 
accomplishments. 
Management 
by Exception 
(active): Watches and searches for deviations from rules and standards, takes 
corrective action. 
Management 
by Exception 
(passive): Intervenes only if standards are not met. 
Laissez-Faire: 
Abdicates 
responsibilities, 
avoids 
making 
decisions. 
22 
cers; United States Navy senior officers and 
junior surface fleet officers; Annapolis 
mid- 
shipmen; educational administrators; 
and re- 
ligious leaders. 
Moreover, various types of evaluations- 
including performance 
ratings by both super- 
visors and direct reports, as well as standard 
financial measures-have 
produced a similar 
correlation 
between 
transformational 
be- 
havior and high ratings. Managers tagged as 
high performers 
by their supervisors were 
also rated, in a separate evaluation 
by their 
followers, as more transformational 
than trans- 
actional. Their organizations 
do better finan- 
cially. The same pattern 
emerged between 
followers’ 
descriptions 
of shipboard 
Naval 
officers and those officers’ supervisors’ per- 
formance 
appraisals and recommendations 
for early promotion. 
And among Methodist 
ministers, transformational-not 
transaction- 
al - leadership behavior was positively related 
to high church 
attendance 
among 
congre- 
gants and growth 
in church membership. 
Results were the same for evaluation 
of 
team performance 
in complex business simu- 
lations. Considerable credit for Boeing’s turn- 
around since its 1969 crisis can be given to its 
chief executive, T.A. Wilson, who has empha- 
sized technological 
progress, aggressive mar- 
keting, and a willingness to take calculated 
business risks. The confidence 
that Boeing 
employees have in Wilson, and their respect 
for him as a brilliant 
engineer and an out- 
standing leader, have instilled in them great 
pride in the company and its products. 
EXTRA EFFORT FROM BELOW 
Transformational 
leaders have better re- 
lationships 
with their supervisors and make 
more of a contribution 
to the organization 
than do those who are only transactional. 
Moreover, employees say that they themselves 
exert a lot of extra effort on behalf of managers 
who are transformational 
leaders. Organiza- 
tions whose leaders are transactional 
are less 
effective than those whose leaders are transfor- 
mational-particularly 
if much of the trans- 
actional leadership is passive management-by- 


----- Page 5 (native text) -----
exception (intervening 
only when standards 
are not being met). Employees say they exert 
little effort 
for such leaders. Nevertheless, 
leader-follower 
transactions 
dependent 
on 
contingent reward may also work reasonably 
well if the leaders can provide rewards that 
are valued by the followers. 
Exhibit 2 illustrates the effect that trans- 
formational, 
as compared with transactional, 
leadership has on employee effort. The data 
were collected from 228 employees of 58 man- 
agers in a large engineering firm. The manag- 
ers were ranked according to their leadership 
factor scores, which were based on descrip- 
tions of leaders by their employees and col- 
leagues on the Multifactor 
Leadership Ques- 
tionnaire. 
“Four-star” leaders were those who 
ranked in the top 25% on a leadership factor 
score; “one-star” leaders were among the bot- 
tom 25% of managers on the leadership fac- 
tor score. From 75% to 82% of the”four-star” 
transformational 
managers 
had employees 
who indicated they frequently 
exerted extra 
effort on their jobs. Of the “one-star” transfor- 
mational 
managers, 
only 22% to 24% had 
employees who said they frequently 
exerted 
extra effort. 
It is interesting to note that, as Exhibit 2 
illustrates, 
being rated as “four-star” 
rather 
than “one-star” in trunsactional 
leadership did 
not have the same impact on employees’ extra 
effort as a high rating had for the transforma- 
tional leaders. Similar findings have emerged 
from studies of leaders and their immediate 
employees at a diverse range of organizations, 
including Digital Equipment Corporation 
and 
Federal Express. 
DIFFERENT STYLES OF 
TRANSFORMATIONAL 
LEADERSHIP 
As noted earlier, certain types of behav- 
ior characterize the transformational 
leader. 
Yet transformational 
leaders vary widely 
in 
their personal styles. H. Ross Perot is self- 
effacing: 
“I don’t look impressive,” 
he says. 
“To a lot of guys I don’t look like I could afford 
a car.” But Perot created the $2.5 billion EDS 
organization 
from his vision, initiative, 
em- 
phasis on hard work, and a special organiza- 
tional culture with strict codes of morality 
and dress and quasi-military 
management. 
His personal involvement in the rescue of two 
of his employees trapped as hostages in Iran 
in 1979 is an extreme example of individual- 
ized consideration, 
a transformational 
factor. 
Leslie Wexner of The Limited, 
Inc. enjoys a 
more flamboyant 
lifestyle. 
But like Perot, 
Wexner converted his vision of a nationwide 
chain of women’s sportswear 
stores into a 
reality through his own hard work. He stimu- 
lates employee 
participation 
in discussions 
and decisions and encourages them to share 
his vision of the company’s future. 
Many on Fortune’s 
list of the ten toughest 
bosses would 
not live up to modern 
be- 
havioral science’s prescriptions 
for the good 
leader: one who initiates the structure for in- 
teraction among his colleagues, and who does 
so with consideration for their welfare. Never- 
theless, these tough bosses are highly success- 
ful as a consequence of the transformational 
qualities they display; Boeing’s Wilson is a 
case in point. Although 
they do initiate struc- 
ture and may be considerate of their employ- 
ees, these leaders succeed through such trans- 
formational 
factors as charisma and the abil- 
ity and willingness to treat different 
subor- 
dinates differently, 
as well as by providing in- 
tellectual stimulation 
for the employees. They 
frequently 
raise standards, 
take calculated 
risks, and get others to join them in their vi- 
sion of the future. Rather than work within 
the organizational 
culture, they challenge and 
change that culture, as Roger Smith of Gen- 
eral Motors Corporation 
did. Self-determina- 
tion and self-confidence 
are characteristic of 
them. They succeed because of these transfor-

in 1941 and 1942 against

British 
in North 
Africa, 
until 
he was 
over- 
whelmed 
at El Alamein. 
Because 
he was up

he could 
make 
more 
rapid 
assessments 
and 
decisions 
than 
could 
his British 
counterparts, 
who 
stayed 
20 
miles back in headquarters. 
This, and his will- 
ingness 
to accept calculated 
risks, contributed 
to his legendary 
speed, 
surprise, 
and 
bold- 
ness, as well as to the continuing 
high 
morale 
of his troops.

of 
Chrysler 
Corporation 
and John Welch 
of Gen- 
eral Electric, 
who have become 
folk heroes 
(or 


----- Page 7 (native text) -----
folk devils, to some), are contemporary 
ex- 
amples of the importance 
of transformational 
leaders to their organizations. 
Leadership makes its presence felt through- 
out the organization 
and its activities. 
We 
have found that employees not only do a bet- 
ter job when they believe their supervisors are 
transformational 
leaders, but they also are 
much more satisfied with the company’s per- 
formance 
appraisal system. Likewise, mass 
communications 
directed toward individual 
employees are much more likely to have an 
impact if the messages are reinforced face-to- 
face by their supervisors at all organizational 
levels. 
Transformational 
leadership 
should 
be 
encouraged, for it can make a big difference 
in the firm’s performance 
at all levels. Man- 
agers need to do more than focus on the ex- 
change of material, social, and personal bene- 
fits for services satisfactorily 
rendered. The 
charismatic 
leader, like the flamboyant 
Ted 
Turner of Turner Broadcasting 
System, Inc. 
can instill a sense of mission; the individually 
considerate leader, like the shy and self-ef- 
facing Roberto Goizueta of the Coca Cola 
Corporation, 
can lead employees to take an 
interest in higher-level concerns; the intellec- 
tually stimulating 
leader, like the innovative 
Roger Smith at General Motors Corporation, 
can articulate a shared vision of jointly 
ac- 
ceptable possibilities. This is not to say that 
transformational 
leaders are always prosocial 
in their efforts, 
for some fulfill 
grandiose 
dreams at the expense of their followers. 
Despite the many successes with manage- 
ment development 
programs and the leader- 
ship development 
programs 
in our military 
academies, 
many executives still feel that 
leadership is like the weather-something 
to 
talk about, but about which not much can be 
done. Others say leadership ability is mysti- 
cal-one 
needs to be born with it. 
In fact, much can be done to improve 
leadership in an organization 
and to change 
the presiding style from transactional to trans- 
formational. 
The overall amount of transfor- 
mational leadership in an organization can be 
increased substantially 
by suitable organiza- 
tional and human resources policies. The new 
model of transformational 
leadership 
pre- 
sents opportunities 
for enhancing a corpora- 
tion’s image and for improving 
its success in 
recruitment, 
selection, and promotion. 
This 
model also has implications 
for the organiza- 
tion’s training and development activities and 
for the design of its jobs and organizational 
structure. 
Implications for Corporate Image 
It is no accident that many of the firms 
identified 
in Tom Peters and Robert Water- 
man’s In Search of Excellence (Warner Books, 
1982) as excellently managed have large num- 
bers of transformational 
leaders. Conversely, 
the poorly 
managed “dinosaurs” among the 
firms they describe need to implement 
a lot 
more 
transformational 
leadership. 
A firm 
that is permeated with transformational 
lead- 
ership from top to bottom conveys to its own 
personnel as well as to customers, suppliers, 
financial backers, and the community 
at large 
that it has its eyes on the future; is confident; 
has personnel who are pulling together for the 
common good; and places a premium 
on its 
intellectual 
resources and flexibility 
and on 
the development 
of its people. 
Implications for Recruiting 
Increasing 
transformational 
leadership 
within 
the organization 
may help in recruit- 
ment. Candidates are likely to be attracted to 
an organization 
whose CEO is charismatic 
and enjoys a public image as a confident, 
sue- 
25 


----- Page 8 (native text) -----
26 
cessful, optimistic, 
dynamic leader. In addi- 
tion, prospects are likely to be attracted by in- 
terview experiences with other members of 
management who exhibit individualized 
con- 
sideration. More intelligent prospects will be 
particularly 
impressed 
with 
intellectually 
stimulating 
contacts they make during 
the 
recruiting 
and hiring process. 
Implications for Selection, Promotion, 
and Transfer 
Since we can identify 
and measure the 
factors associated with transformational 
lead- 
ership, these factors should be incorporated 
into managerial assessment, selection, place- 
ment, and guidance programs-along 
with 
related assessments of relevant personal di- 
mensions and individual 
differences. 
Some- 
what 
more 
transformational 
leadership 
is 
generally expected and found 
as managers 
move to successively higher levels in the orga- 
nization, but it is reasonable to expect that an 
individual’s performance 
at one level will be 
similar to his or her performance 
at the next. 
Direct reports, peers, and/or supervisors can 
be asked to describe the manager’s current 
leadership with 
the Multifactor 
Leadership 
Questionnaire; 
their responses should be con- 
sidered when decisions are made regarding a 
manager’s promotion 
or transfer into a posi- 
tion 
of greater supervisory 
responsibility. 
Feedback from these results can also be used 
for counseling, coaching, and mentoring. 
Further, the organization 
can tap the per- 
sonal characteristics and strengths that under- 
lie the manager’s transformational 
behavior. 
Charismatic 
leaders are characterized by en- 
ergy, self-confidence, 
determination, 
intel- 
lect, verbal skills, and strong ego ideals. Each 
of these traits can be assessed in individual 
managers. Similarly, we can assess some of 
the traits underlying 
individualized 
consider- 
ation, such as coaching skills; preference for 
two-way, 
face-to-face 
communication; 
and 
willingness to delegate. Again, in the area of 
intellectual 
stimulation, 
candidates for pro- 
motion could be assessed with an eye toward 
the type of intellectual stimulation-general, 
creative, 
or mathematical-that 
would 
be 
most effective at the higher level of manage- 
ment. Appropriate 
intelligence tests may be 
used to select intellectually 
stimulating candi- 
dates. 
Research findings indicate that when em- 
ployees rate their managers on the MLQ, they 
describe new business leaders as significantly 
more transformational 
than established busi- 
ness leaders. Thus MLQ scores can be used 
profitably 
to identify executives to head new 
ventures. 
Implications 
for Development 
A management 
trainee’s first supervisor 
can make a big difference in his or her subse- 
quent career success. For example, six years 
after they joined Exxon, many managers who 
were highly rated by their supervisors report- 
ed that they had been given challenging 
as- 
signments by their initial supervisor (i.e., they 
had received individualized 
consideration). 
Many had been assigned to supervisors with 
good reputations 
in the firm. It is important 
to note that managers tend to model their own 
leadership style after that of their immediate 
supervisors. 
Thus if more 
higher-ups 
are 
transformational, 
more lower-level employ- 
ees will emulate transformational 
behavior - 
and will be likely to act as transformational 
leaders as they rise in the organization. 
Organizational 
policy needs to support 
an understanding 
and appreciation 
of the 
maverick who is willing 
to take unpopular 
positions, who knows when to reject the con- 
ventional wisdom, and who takes reasonable

risks. For example, when R. Gordon McGov- 
ern took over as president of Campbell Soup, 
he introduced 
the “right to fail” policy, which 
shook up the stodgy organization. 
On the 
other hand, the fine line between self-con- 
fidence and obstinacy needs to be drawn. The 
determined 
Winston 
Churchill 
who contri- 
buted so much to the survival of Britain in 
shown that leaders at all levels can be trained 
to be charismatic in both verbal and nonver- 
bal performance. 
Successful programs have 
been conducted for first-level project leaders 
in hi-tech computer firms as well as for senior 
executives of insurance firms. 
That transformational 
leadership can be 
increased through 
training 
was verified 
in 
~4Transfomational 
leader&@ can be learned,, 
and it can-and 
should-be 
the subject of 
management training and development. Re- 
search has shown that leaders at all levek can 
be trained to be charismatic . . .” 
1940 was the same Churchill whose obstinacy 
contributed 
to the mistakes in 1941 of failing 
to prepare Singapore adequately and of com- 
mitting British troops to unnecessary disaster 
in Crete and Greece. 
Intellectual 
stimulation 
also needs to be 
nurtured 
and cultivated as a way of life in the 
organization. 
The ‘best and the brightest” 
people should be hired, nourished, 
and en- 
couraged. 
Innovation 
and creativity 
should 
be fostered at all levels in the firm. 
Implications 
for Training 
Despite conventional 
wisdom to the con- 
trary, transformational 
leadership is a wide- 
spread phenomenon. 
True, more of it occurs 
at the top than at the bottom 
of an organiza- 
tion; but it has also been observed by many 
employees in their first-level supervisors. Trans- 
formational 
leadership can be learned, and it 
can -and 
should -be 
the subject of manage- 
ment training and development. 
Research has 
an experiment 
when Multifactor 
Leadership 
Questionnaire 
scores were obtained on shop 
supervisors from their trainees, who were in- 
mates in minimum, 
medium, 
and maximum 
security 
prisons. 
The supervisors 
worked 
directly with the inmates in industrial 
shops 
to produce various products for sale within 
and outside the prison system. The experi- 
ment compared four groups of supervisors on 
their pre- and post-training 
effectiveness in 
various industrial and vocational shops in the 
prison. One group was trained in transforma- 
tional leadership, one group was trained in 
transactional 
leadership, 
one was untrained 
but measured “before and after,” and one was 
untrained and measured only “after.” The per- 
formances of both trained groups improved, 
but in comparison 
to the three other groups 
of supervisors, 
those who were trained 
in 
transformational 
leadership 
did as well or 
better at improving 
productivity, 
absentee- 
ism, and “citizenship” behavior among the in- 
mates; they also won more respect from the 
inmates.

TRAINING 
MANAGERS 
Practical 
training 
that 
teaches people 
how to be transformational 
is similar to that 
used in the Xerox RPG strategy to modify 
management 
style. A counselor, mediator, or 
supervisor gives a manager a detailed, stan- 
dardized description of his or her transforma- 
tional 
and transactional 
leadership perfor- 
mance as rated by the manager’s employees 
and/or 
colleagues. The Multifactor 
Leader- 
ship Questionnaire 
is used for this purpose, 
The manager also sees a chart showing the ef- 
fects of his or her leadership 
on employee 
satisfaction, 
motivation, 
and perception 
of 
organizational 
effectiveness. 
Anonymity 
is 
maintained, 
although the manager sees the in- 
dividual 
differences among the responses. 
Participating 
managers complete a paral- 
lel questionnaire 
about their own leadership. 
The discrepancies 
between 
how they rate 
themselves and how 
their employees 
rate 
them may be examined 
scale-by-scale and 
item-by-item. 
The counselor may pose such 
questions as: “Why do you think you gave 
yourself .a much higher score than your em- 
ployees gave you in individualized 
considera- 
tion?” and “Why did your employees disagree 
with you on how rapidly you get to the heart 
of complex problems or the extent to which 
they trust you to overcome any obstacles?” It 
is important 
for managers to be aware of and 
accept their employees’ view of their perfor- 
mance. A study of United States Naval offi- 
cers found that those who agreed with their 
direct reports about 
their transformational 
leadership behavior were also likely to earn 
higher fitness ratings and recommendations 
for early promotion 
from their supervisors. 
The manager and the counselor discuss in 
detail why certain results may have appeared 
and what can be done to improve ratings. For 
example, a manager 
may be asked: “What 
28 
specific behavior 
on your part makes your 
employees say they are proud to work with 
you?” or “What have you done that results in 
your colleagues’ saying you foster a sense of 
mission?” The collected responses to these 
questions can create a useful picture of what 
the manager can do to raise his or her perfor- 
mance on particular 
items. 
In addition to working individually 
with 
a counselor, the manager also may participate 
in a workshop 
with other managers who are 
working toward becoming more transforma- 
tional 
leaders. Workshop 
participants 
who 
received high ratings from their employees on 
a particular item are asked what they, the par- 
ticipants, specifically did to achieve these rat- 
ings. Questions might include: “Why did all 
of your employees say that you frequently en- 
abled them to think about old problems in 
new ways?” or “Why did they all say that you 
increased their optimism 
for the future?” 
Conversely, questions may focus on why 
a participant’s 
employees varied widely 
in 
their ratings. If the data printout shows a wide 
divergence of opinion about whether a man- 
ager made the employees enthusiastic about 
assignments, he or she might be asked to sug- 
gest possible reasons for such differences of 
opinion 
among the employees. 
Other Approaches to Training 
Several other approaches to teaching trans- 
formational 
leadership make use of the spe- 
cific data gathered in the workshop. 
For in- 
stance, participants 
are asked to think of an 
effective leader they have known and the be- 
havior the leader displayed. Many examples 
of charisma, 
individualized 
consideration, 
and intellectual stimulation 
are usually noted. 
The effective leaders who are mentioned typi- 
cally come from many levels inside and out- 
side the organization; 
the workshop 
leader 
may point out that transformational 
leader- 


----- Page 11 (native text) -----
ship is neither particularly 
uncommon 
nor 
limited only to world class leaders. Moreover, 
these leaders’ specific behaviors can be de- 
scribed, observed, and adopted. After view- 
ing videotapes 
of charismatic, 
individually 
considerate, 
and 
intellectually 
stimulating 
managers in action, workshop 
participants 
may be asked to create their own scenarios 
and videotapes, 
in which they emulate the 
transformational 
leaders they have observed. 
The other participants 
may then offer cri- 
tiques and suggest improvements. 
The workshop also aims to increase other 
aspects of transformational 
leadership. The 
transformational 
leader develops and changes 
the organizational 
culture, and to show par- 
ticipants that they have such capabilities, the

ployees and review these data with them. 
l 
I am going to ask for another “reading” 
in a year; in the meantime I will try to reduce

where I should be. 
l 
I’m going

my mentor 
about 
these results and ask him what 
he 
thinks I should do about them. 
Implications 
for Leadership Education 
Military 
academies 
have traditionally 
emphasized leadership education, 
and today 
we are seeing a surge of interest in leadership 
courses in liberal arts colleges as well. At least 
<CA counselor mediatoq or supervisor gives a 
manager a detailed, standardized description 
of his or her transfmational 
and transac- 
tional lead&@ performance as rated by the 
managers’ employees and/or colleagues.” 
workshop 
leader asks them to imagine what 
the organization 
might be like in two to five 
years if it were fully aligned with their own 
ideas and interests. Then, 
in small teams 
based on their actual functions at work, they 
proceed to redesign the organization. 
Similarly, training 
in mentoring 
can be 
used to promote the transformational 
factor 
of individualized 
consideration. 
For example, 
one participant 
can counsel another while a 
third acts as an observer and a source of 
feedback about the performance. 
And many 
creativity 
exercises show a manager how he 
or she can be more intellectually 
stimulating. 
Action plans emerge from workshop sessions. 
Examples include the following: 
600 such courses were being offered, accord- 
ing to a recently completed survey of colleges. 
The Center for Creative Leadership holds con- 
ferences on leadership courses in undergradu- 
ate education, 
most recently in the summer 
of 1986. The subject of transformational 
leadership also has been added to leadership 
courses at the U.S. Air Force Academy 
at 
Colorado 
Springs. In one such course, both 
faculty and students examined how Air Force 
officers 
who 
are transformational 
leaders 
serve as role models for cadets. Scales from 
the Multifactor 
Leadership 
Questionnaire 
were used to show that the transformational 
leaders among the instructors and staff pro- 
vided role models for their students. 
The 
29

30 
faculty and students discussed the question- 
naire results and their implications. 
Clearly, training 
cannot 
turn a purely 
transactional 
leader into a transformational 
leader. Moreover, some managers, while striv- 
ing to be transformational 
leaders, misuse 
their training; 
their pseudotransformational 
efforts only further the manager’s self-interest 
and values. Under the influence of such a 
manager, employees can be misdirected away 
from their own best interests and those of the 
organization 
as a whole. 
In one such case, 
Donald Burr of People’s Express Airlines dis- 
played many transformational 
qualities that 
rapidly built and then rapidly ruined the firm. 
For too long, leadership development has 
been seen as mainly a matter of skill develop- 
ment. But leadership-particularly 
transfor- 
mational 
leadership - should be regarded as 
an art and a science. It is encouraging to see 
that the Council for Liberal Learning of the 
Association of American Colleges now spon- 
sors week-long conferences on leadership for 
scholars, prominent 
citizens, and national 
leaders. 
ImpIications for Job Design and 
Job Assignment 
As we have noted earlier, the results of a 
study of Exxon managers showed that highly 
rated managers had had challenging 
tasks 
delegated to them by their supervisors when 
they first joined the company. Jobs can-and 
should - be designed to provide greater chal- 
lenges. Delegation with guidance and follow- 
up can become an individualizing 
and de- 
velopmental 
way of life in a firm. 
Transformational 
leaders show individu- 
alized consideration 
by paying attention 
to 
the particular 
development 
needs of each of 
their employees. Employees’ jobs are designed 
with those needs in mind, as well as the needs 
of the organization. 
One employee needs ex- 
perience leading 
a project 
team. Another 
needs an opportunity 
to reinforce what she 
has learned in an advanced computer 
pro- 
gramming class. Their transformational 
leader 
assigns them tasks accordingly. 
Leaders can be intellectually 
stimulating 
to their employees if their own jobs allow 
them to explore new opportunities, 
to diag- 
nose organizational 
problems, and to gener- 
ate solutions. Leaders whose jobs force them 
to focus on solving small, immediate 
prob- 
lems are likely to be less intellectually 
stim- 
ulating 
than those who have time to think 
ahead and in larger terms. 
Implications for Organizational 
Structure 
Transformational 
leadership is not a pan- 
acea. In many situations, it is inappropriate 
and transactional 
processes are indicated. In 
general, firms that are functioning 
in stable 
markets can afford to depend on their “one- 
minute” managers to provide the necessary, 
day-to-day 
leadership. 
If the 
technology, 
workforce, 
and environment 
are stable as 
well, then things are likely to move along 
quite well with managers who simply promise 
and deliver rewards to employees for carrying 
out assignments. And in stable organizations, 
even management-by-exception 
can be quite 
effective if the manager monitors 
employee 
performance 
and takes corrective action as 
needed. 
Rules and regulations 
for getting 
things done, when clearly understood and ac- 
cepted by the employees, can eliminate the 
need for 
leadership 
under 
some circum- 
stances. 
But when the firm is faced with a turbu- 
lent marketplace; when its products are born, 
live, and die within the span of a few years; 
and/or when its current technology can be- 


----- Page 13 (native text) -----
come obsolete before it is fully depreciated; 
then transformational 
leadership needs to be 
fostered at all levels in the firm. In order to 
succeed, the firm needs to have the flexibility 
to forecast and meet new demands and changes 
as they occur-and 
only transformational 
leadership can enable the firm to do so. 
Problems, rapid changes, and uncertain- 
ties call for a flexible organization 
with deter- 
mined leaders who can inspire employees to 
participate 
enthusiastically 
in team efforts 
and share in organizational 
goals. In short, 
charisma, attention 
to individualized 
devel- 
opment, 
and the ability 
and willingness to 
provide intellectual stimulation 
are critical in 
leaders whose firms are faced with demands 
for renewal and change. 
At these organiza- 
tions, 
fostering 
transformational 
leadership 
through 
policies 
of 
recruitment, 
selection, 
promotion, 
training, 
and 
development 
is 
likely 
to pay off in the health, 
well-being, 
and 
effective 
performance 
of the organization.
