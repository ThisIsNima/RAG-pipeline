Abstract: Transport play an important role in the development of the economy. For efficient 
functioning of the transport system there should be not only high technical condition of rolling stock, 
but also developed transport infrastructure. The geographic position of Ukraine makes it a promising 
transit state. Thanks to the research, it has been found that in Ukraine there are priority terrestrial 
modes of transport in comparison with other types. Since transport is one of the main components of 
economic development, it is relevant to study this sector of the economy and identify prospective 
directions for improvement, namely the formation of Transport-Logistics Clusters (TLC) in Ukraine. 
Having analyzed the experience of other countries in the establishment of TLC, they have identified 
the benefits of different cluster strategies for the formation of TLCs in Ukraine. 
Keywords: clustering, transport-logistic cluster, cluster, transport network. 
 
1. Introduction 
One of the main tasks of the present time for Ukraine is to increase the competitiveness of the 
national economy. Transport has a great influence on all spheres of the economy, as it provides the 
promotion of material flows in macro-logistics chains. The development of the transport-logistic system 
is one of the important components of the Ukrainian economy. Considering the experience of 
economically developed countries, it can be argued that in order to increase the level of technological 
potential of the country, it is necessary to introduce innovative methods into its general economic 
system. 
One of the modern innovative technologies for the development of the transport-logistic system is 
the formation of a transport-logistic complex in Ukraine. This requires effective operation of the 
transport infrastructure, the attraction of an efficient rolling stock for the transport process, as well as 
investments to ensure the quality work and competitiveness of the transport industry in the European 
and domestic markets of transport services. The modern direction of improving the efficiency of 
transport sector enterprises is the creation of transport-logistic clusters. 
Many foreign and domestic scientists consider issues relating to the functioning of cluster units 
and the peculiarities of the formation and development of transport-logistic clusters, among them: 
Porter М. [1], Solvell O. [2], Williams M. [2], Kergel H. [3], Hatsch S. [3], Delgado M. [4], Stern S. [4], 
Wennberg K. [5], Lindqvist G. [5], Ketels Ch. [6], Kovbatyuk M.V. [7], Doroshchuk V.O. [8], Chupaylenko 
O.A. [9, 10], Grytsenko S.I. [11], Karpenko O.O. [12]. Goblyk V.V. [13], Ivanov S.V. [14], Popova N.V. [15], 
Volkovska G.G. [16], Yanovskyi P.O. [16] and many other.  
In scientific works of these authors the theoretical and methodological aspects of cluster 
formation, the preconditions for their creation and influence on the competitiveness of the region, 
within which formed cluster structures, were studied.

The founder of the cluster approach, M. Porter has defined the cluster as a concentration in the 
geographic region of interconnected and interrelated enterprises and institutions within a particular 
region [1]. 
Researchers O. Solwell and M. Williams in their work have considered the evolutionary and 
constructive factors which influence the mechanisms of cluster creation and determine its development 
and competitiveness [2]. 
In the work of the scientist K. Ketels [6] it has been put forward a hypothesis regarding the most 
effective policy of cluster support. It is a policy of cluster activation aimed at overcoming the negative 
factors that hinder the evolution of clusters, improving the business environment, infrastructure 
development, etc., which creating the conditions that allow the cluster to develop on its own. 
Author Kovbatyuk M.V. in his scientific work has determined that the cluster represents itself a 
networked production and commercial structure that has the ability to concentrate and bring together 
related manufacturers, often even competing, for the purpose of co-operation for the production of 
competitive products [7]. This is confirmed by the development of a network of clusters in Europe and 
their integration into global, primary and secondary TLCs. 
Doroshchuk V.O. is engaged in research of the concept of clusters. He has given a generalized 
definition of the concept of "cluster", having determined that the cluster is a territorial and voluntary 
association of business structures, scientific institutions, institutions of market infrastructure and 
institutions of the authorities for the purpose to increase the competitiveness of its own products and 
promote the economic development of the region and enhance the competitive advantages of each 
other through the effect of synergy [8]. They are created from a small (10-15 companies) and a large 
number of enterprises and structures (6-7 thousand companies) in various forms of associations and 
organizations. The cluster is considered as the geographical concentration of companies operating in a 
separate business, and the conglomeration of large and small firms, some of which may be the property 
of foreigners. They appear in traditional industries and in the areas of high technology, in the 
production and commercial segment or in the service sector, as well as in social spheres. 
Author Chupaylenko O.A. in its researches has defined the transport-logistic cluster as a set of 
regional motor transport enterprises, representatives of enterprises of other types of transport, 
logistics companies, licensed warehouses, local authorities and research institutes in the form of 
associative unit with adequate financial contributions of participants, operating infrastructure, modern 
communications that enhance the interaction and benefits compared to other competitors, which 
allows to increase investment attractiveness and sustainable development of regional areas. They are 
divided into three categories: port, border and territorial (regional) [9]. 
Author Grytsenko S.I. in his monograph has described the concept of a transport-logistic cluster, 
which involves the unification of certain regional, functional and economically connected logistics units: 
international transport corridors, transport nodes of main infrastructure, transport and distribution 
logistics centers, main, regional and local routes of connection into a single system of transportation 
process, able to provide high-quality logistic service to internal or external consumers in minimizing 
general logistics expenses [11]. 
Having examined the work of clusters, author Karpenko O.O. has determined that the creation of 
clusters will contribute to the growth of productivity and innovative activity of enterprises that are the 
parts of the cluster, as well as to increase the intensity of development of small and medium 
enterprises, to increase the attraction of investments, will help accelerate socio-economic development 
of regions, where the cluster will placement, which will allow to increase the number of jobs, salaries, 
revenues to budgets of all levels, increase the stability and the competitiveness of the regional 
economy [12]. 
Among the strategic priorities of the European Commission is the development of cluster concepts, 
since cluster policy has been recognized as one of the foundations for building Europe's 
competitiveness and its dynamic development through the introduction of innovations. The purpose of 
the European Commission for clusters is to maximize the contribution of clusters to the development of 
the European economy, the growth of entrepreneurship and the enhancement of regional economic 
competitiveness [17].

3. Materials and Methods 
An essential condition for obtaining new knowledge on the basis of discovered scientific facts 
during the conduct of scientific research is the use of well-founded scientific research methods. 
Obtaining the desired result directly depends on the original theoretical position, from the principle 
approach to the problem statement and the definition of the path of research. 
In order to reveal the theoretical foundations, peculiarities and characteristics of the processes of 
formation of transport-logistic clusters in Ukraine, a statistical analysis of the activity of international 
transport-logistic clusters and indicators of activity of the transport industry of Ukraine and modes of 
transport included in its transport system was used, and the general scientific methods of research 
were used: method of empirical research (monitoring, comparison), method of theoretical research 
(formalization), general methods of research (analysis, synthesis, analogy). 
4. Results 
The leading countries of the world with high indicators of development of the national economy 
have achieved their competitiveness through the introduction of innovative technologies. 
The world experience of recent decades confirms that cluster initiatives are rapidly expanding in 
developed countries. Due to the fact that a number of states have a federal structure, in some of them 
the cluster policy began to be implemented at the regional level earlier than at the federal level. 
According to the European cluster observatory in Europe there are more than 2 thousand regional 
clusters, and the potential for the development of cluster entities for the future is estimated at 9 
thousand units [18]. 
In the EU countries, demand for transport-logistics services is growing every year. One of the most 
promising technologies at present time is the formation of Transport-Logistic Clusters (TLCs). There 
are more than 86 logistic clusters in the territory of Europe, of which about 25 are the main ones that 
can be considered as global clusters of European significance (through them pass the main cargo flows), 
as well as about 60 secondary clusters. The qualitative functioning of the TLC will contribute to the high 
level of service of transport and logistics consumers. In this case, it is necessary to take into account the 
needs and wishes of consumers, to establish a strong relationship between all enterprises involved in 
the process of cargo transportation, which will promote competitiveness and customer satisfaction 
with logistics services. 
EU countries adhere to the principles of the operation of TLCs, which allow the provision of quality 
logistics services, the main of which are: 
- the offer of the most complete list of transport and related services on the basis of contractual 
relations with each participant of the logistics chain (the formation of a data bank of logistic chains); 
- organization of complex transport services on the basis of a single contract for integrated 
services and a single order for all services, the formation of tasks for participants of the logistics chain 
based on the order of the user of transport services, centralized control of the order fulfillment; 
- standardization and unification of transport and other documents used by participants in 
logistics chains and which are necessary for carrying out transportation, in order to ensure the 
possibility of creating a single information space; 
- development of a unified marketing strategy and tactics of logistics chain participants in the 
market of transport services, joint conducting market researches and marketing activities that ensure 
the promotion of all participants in the logistics chain in the market of transport services and formation 
of demand for integrated transport services; 
- the distribution of structural units of the cluster on a geographic basis in order to maximize the 
coverage of the market of transport services, the implementation of operational management of the 
work of logistics chains in the places of formation and intersection of freight traffic; 
- organization of cooperation with Ukrainian and international organizations involved in transport 
logistics; 
- development of organizational principles of work on the basis of world standards and 
international treaties, agreements, conventions; 
- integration with international logistics centers and provision of information exchange;

‹ 155 › 
- standardization of information interaction of logistic chains of participants of the international 
transport-logistic cluster [13]. 
Joining the cluster it gives a number of benefits to the enterprises and institutions that it includes, 
the main of which are: a clearer orientation to the market of transport services and the possibility of 
adjusting it to the needs of consumers; the opportunity for the cluster participants to more effectively 
defend their interests at the level of local authorities, participate in large investment projects and join 
the joint promising program of their development. The transport-logistic cluster should include 
transport, transport-logistics enterprises, as well as enterprises that serve the service, institutions of 
legislative and executive power of different levels. Carrying out high-quality transport activity depends 
on cooperation of business, science and authorities. Therefore, the formation of a transport-logistic 
cluster is influenced by certain sectors, such as the manufacturing sector, the administrative sector, the 
transport-logistic sector, the service sector, the financial sector, the innovation sector (specialized 
universities, research institutes that develop new innovative methods for implementation in the 
transport process, consulting centers), state-legal sector [19]. 
The geographic and geopolitical position of Ukraine is positioning it as a country with a high 
transit rate. According to forecasts, 5 of the 11 branches of Hyperloop high-speed ground transport can 
pass through the territory of Ukraine, of which three pass through Kyiv: the first will connect China, 
Europe and Canada; the second one - Asia, the Middle East, Europe and North Africa; the third - Spain 
and China [14]. The main part of clusters is expected to be formed at the intersection of main cargo 
streams and in places of passage of transport corridors, which allows to reach the objects of warehouse 
infrastructure. Therefore, the formation of TLC will provide the need for both external and internal 
logistics services. 
Today, the world practice of forming and functioning TLC considers several models that have their 
own peculiarities in work. There are three varieties of clusters: scientific clusters, transferring their 
technologies to industry; clusters that combine research and production; clusters that arise on the basis 
of innovative firms operating in a competitive environment. 
The Italian cluster model consists of a set of small firms (small and medium enterprises), which 
are united in various associations to enhance their competitiveness. In this model, the state plays a 
significant role, providing its support. Significant role in the development of Italian clusters has 
"collective institutes" - national conferences, industrial parks, financial and marketing consortia, 
technological institutes [15, 16]. 
The peculiarity of the American model of the cluster is the joint activity of state structures, 
industrial enterprises and academic organizations. Such a model of cluster development is aimed at 
increasing global competitiveness on the basis of scientific and technological advances and innovations. 
In the German model of clustering, the preference is given to the development of the economy on 
the basis of high technology - this is precisely in this direction the consolidation of the efforts of 
industrial and scientific centers. 
The British model of clustering involves reviewing the priorities of industrial policy, which results 
is the formation of a so-called promising technological program on the basis of a mixed sector-cluster 
approach [15]. An example of the operation of the British TLC model can be the see cluster, which was 
established in 2003. Its aim was to increase investment in the industry and increase its efficiency at the 
local, regional, national and international levels. 
An important component of the TLC is transport and its infrastructure. For a better understanding 
of the opportunities and prospects of an indicative selection of a TLC model for Ukraine, we need to 
consider trends in transport and transport infrastructure development in our country, using statistical 
data [20]. 
The analysis of freight volumes (Figure 1) has showed that there has been a tendency for their 
increase during the last four years, even though the volume of transportation in 2018 decreased by 
4.9% compared to 2017. However, compared to 2015, volumes of transportation grew by 8.7%.

In the last five years there has been a tendency to increase volumes of transportation of freights by 
rolling stock of road transport (Table 2). Thus, in 2018 more than 29% of the total volume of freight 
transportation was carried out by road transport. Compared to 2013, the specific gravity of road 
transport increased by more than 5%. In 2018, the specific gravity of freight transportation by rail was 
51.6% of the total volume and decreased by almost 7% compared to 2013.

At the same time, in the first place, as in the analogous period of 2017, rail transport remains. 
According to the results of the analysis of the data in 2018, freight turnover by rail decreased by 3% 
compared to the previous year. For the last three years, freight turnover by road transport has a steady 
upward trend. In 2018, it increased by more than 3% compared with 2017.  
There is a tendency to fluctuate data on the average distance of freight transportation by different 
types of transport (Table 4). According to the data of the table in recent years there is an increase in the 
average distance of transportation of 1 ton of freight by all types of transport, except water.

An analysis of the transport sector in the provision of services (Table 5) shows that the volumes of 
transport services provided in 2018 amounted to almost 5% of the total volume of services sold by 
enterprises of various types of economic activity. The largest specific gravity has the services of 
transport, warehousing and enterprises that provide transport services and belonging to the transport 
infrastructure.

Ukraine is an active participant in the international transport services market. It has significant 
potential to increase offers to external parterres and expand their capacity to deliver. Analysis of the 
dynamics of the transport services structure provided in the "export" and "import" modes (Figure 4) 
shows that there is a tendency for exports to prevail over imports. But the current tendency to 
gradually increase the volume of transport services in the mode of "import" shows the growing demand 
for domestic transport services in the international market.

Analysis of the volume of provision of transport services in different customs modes by various 
types of transport (Figure 5, Figure 6), allows us to conclude that in the export mode, the highest rates 
have a pipeline transport, but in the mode of import the most popular are air and rail transport. It 
should be noted that for the last three years, the volume of provision of transport services in different 
customs modes by all types of transport has a steady tendency to increase.

Research and analysis of the indicators of the transport industry has shown that they have 
ambiguous dynamics. The factors influencing the volatility of volumes of freight transportation may 
include such as the reduction of industrial production due to the external markets, the reduction of 
domestic demand due to the decrease in purchasing power of the population. 
5. Discussion 
Ukraine's orientation towards European integration and market transformations, a positive trend 
towards increased a cargo flows to the European Union requires solutions to issues related to ensuring 
competitiveness of the transport industry enterprises of the country, scientific substantiation of the 
possibilities of Ukraine's integration into the European transport system and development of its 
transport sector by creating effective transport-logistic clusters taking into account the experience of 
developed countries of the world. Formation of transport-logistics clusters will increase the 
competitiveness of the transport industry both at the national and regional levels, which will facilitate 
the process of integration of Ukraine's transport network into European and world transport and trade 
networks [19]. Introduction of clustering in the processes of management of the transport industry 
activity contributes to the formation of a new strategy of cooperation between enterprises that are part 
of the transport- logistics cluster, to increase the efficiency of their operation and promotes the 
development of the transport sector of the country. Clustering provides the opportunity to increase the 
competitiveness of the economy of regions and the state as a whole. Due to clustering, opportunities for 
combining enterprises, organizations and institutions in both separate regions and countries can be

considered in order to increase the efficiency of their activities, to facilitate the formation of new 
enterprises taking into account their favorable geographical location and the creation of new jobs. 
The state, regional and local structures of Ukraine have begun the introduction of clustering in the 
processes of formation, management and optimization of competitive units in various sectors of social 
production. The development of clustering in Europe should positively affect the formation of TLCs in 
Ukraine. Formation of a cluster unit leads to increased competitiveness, the formation of a new strategy 
for cooperation between enterprises, organizations and institutions of various levels. Cluster 
associations can perform various functions - industrial, technological, innovative and others. A 
fundamentally new direction is the use of cluster capabilities in providing information and educational 
activities, conducting on the basis of clusters of educational and scientific work, creation of advisory 
and training centers on the development of the transport industry. Taking into account the passage 
through Ukraine of four out of ten pan-European transport corridors (No. 3; No. 5; No. 7; No. 9) and 
four transcontinental transport corridors (Europe-Asia, TRACEKA, Baltyka-Black Sea, Black Sea 
transport ring), and also extremely advantageous transit status of Ukraine, it is possible to talk about 
the creation of a network of main and major transport-logistic clusters on the territory of Ukraine as an 
integral part of the pan-European network of TLCs [10]. 
The transport network of Ukraine has a powerful potential for the efficient operation of 
transport-logistics clusters. Currently, there are about 50 clusters operating in Ukraine, among which 
the following can be distinguished: Carpathian region (transport-logistic cluster); Odessa region 
(cluster "Odessa"); Kherson region (transport-logistic cluster "Southern Gates of Ukraine"). The most 
promising cluster centers can be considered such large cities as Kiev, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Odessa, as 
they are the leading centers of railways and highways of their region. 
According to its specificity and territoriality, two categories can be distinguished among clusters: 
it is the port (Izmail, Bilhorod-Dnistrovsky, Illichivsk, Odessa, Southern, Mykolaiv, Kherson, Mariupol, 
Zaporizhzhia, Dnipro, and others) and internal ones, which can be divided into border (Kovel, Chop, 
Kharkiv, Chernihiv and others) and regional (Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Vinnytsia, Poltava, Sumy, Dnipro, 
Kirovograd, Lviv and others). 
One of the important cluster is the Odessa cluster due to its ability to integrate into the 
trans-European transport network TEN-T and provide transit of goods between the major economic 
centers of the world: the Asia-Pacific region and the European Union. 
Its main components are: 
– multimodal transport corridors of Ukraine; 
– deep-water port in Hadjibei estuary; 
– cargo terminal of Odessa airport; 
– International Center for High Technology B-ZONE; 
– a comprehensive line of electric transport of Odessa agglomeration; 
– Green Island in the center of Odessa. 
Such a powerful potential of this cluster could allow it to become the largest port-industrial 
complex of Eurasia [21]. 
6. Conclusions 
The foreign experience of using a cluster approach to the formation of transport-logistic clusters 
has shown that at present there are no universal approaches in solving this issue. Each country 
develops its own models and approaches to creating clusters and managing their development, taking 
into account the availability of natural, technological, financial, labor and intellectual resources. 
An analysis of the models of TLC functioning in the leading countries of the world, an analysis of 
the state and trends of the transport industry in Ukraine over the last years, allows us to conclude that 
the Italian model is the closest to the implementation in Ukraine. In the Italian model of the cluster the 
focus of its operation is given to small competing firms that unite to enhance competitiveness. In such a 
cluster model, the state exercises its influence at the level of local self-government. 
The formation of transport-logistics clusters is an innovative and promising direction for 
improving the efficiency of the transport industry in Ukraine. The basis for forming a transport-logistic 
cluster should be the transport, logistics and other enterprises that serve the service function, as well as 
the legislative and executive institutions of different levels. Merge into a cluster has a number of

benefits for enterprises, organizations and institutions that it includes, the main of which are: a clearer 
focus on the market of transport services and the ability to respond promptly to its needs. Therefore, 
the development of theoretical foundations for the formation of TLCs is a topical issue and it needs 
further research.
