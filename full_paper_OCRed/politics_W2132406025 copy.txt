Abstract
This article examines the extent
to which racial differences in
socio-economic status (SES),
social class and acute and
chronic indicators of perceived
discrimination, as well as
general measures of stress can
account for black–white
differences in self-reported
measures of physical and
mental health. The observed
racial differences in health were
markedly reduced when
adjusted for education and
especially income. However,
both perceived discrimination
and more traditional measures
of stress are related to health
and play an incremental role in
accounting for differences
between the races in health
status. These ﬁndings
underscore the need for
research efforts to identify the
complex ways in which
economic and non-economic
forms of discrimination relate
to each other and combine with
socio-economic position and
other risk factors and resources
to affect health.

one of the most firmly established
and frequently reported patterns in the distribu-
tion of health status in the United States is that
African Americans (or blacks) have higher
rates of death, disease and disability than
whites have. This pattern has been documented
for over 150 years (Krieger, 1987) and in 1990
blacks had higher rates than whites for 13 of
the 15 leading causes of death in the United
States (National Center for Health Statistics,
1994). Although the ﬁndings are not uniform,
studies of mental health status also generally
ﬁnd that, compared to whites, blacks have
higher levels of psychological distress (non-
speciﬁc emotional symptoms) and lower levels
of subjective well-being (Vega & Rumbaut,
1991). Recent data reveal that for some indica-
tors of health status, such as infant mortality
and low birth weight, the relative gap between
blacks and whites has widened in recent dec-
ades, while for other indicators, such as life
expectancy and sexually transmitted diseases,
there has been an absolute decline in the
health of the African–American population in
some recent years (Williams & Collins, 1995).
Despite decades of research, our understand-
ing of the factors responsible for racial differ-
ences in health is still limited. Historically,
research on racial differences in health has
been premised on the notion that blacks and
whites were biologically distinct groups and
that observed disparities could be traced to
biological differences between the races (Krie-
ger, 1987). Much of this research was blatantly
racist and explicitly attempted to provide a sci-
entiﬁc rationale for policies of racial inequal-
ity. Blatant racial bias is rare in current
research in the medical sciences, but there is a
persistent tendency, even in the face of scien-
tiﬁc evidence to the contrary, to deﬁne race in
terms of underlying genetic homogeneity and
to understand racial differences in health in
terms of innate biological differences (Wil-
liams, Lavizzo-Mourey, & Warren, 1994; Wit-
zig, 1996). In contrast, anthropologists (Gould,
1977; Lewontin, 1972) and health researchers
(Cooper & David, 1986; Krieger, Rowley,
Herman, Avery, & Phillips, 1993; Williams, in
press) emphasize the scientiﬁc information that
indicates that race is a gross indicator of dis-
tinctive social and individual histories and not
a measure of biological distinctiveness. Races
are socially constructed categories that have
emerged in the context of social and economic
oppression and have been used to perpetuate
economic, cultural, ideological, political and
legal systems of inequality (Omi & Winant,
1986). This view of race does not deny that
there may be biological aspects to race. How-
ever, genetic or biologic factors are not the
central deﬁning characteristics of race and are
unlikely to be the primary sources of racial
differences in health. Although racial differen-
ces in biological processes have been found
(e.g. in sodium secretion), these processes may
be inﬂuenced by psychosocial factors (Ander-
son, McNeilly, & Myers, 1991). Moreover, not
only can social conditions produce physiologi-
cal differences between races, they may also
interact with any innate biological differences
to affect health.
Race, SES and health
The worsening health status of African Amer-
icans must be understood within the larger
context of the increasing polarization of income
and wealth in the United States. In recent years
much of the past gains in economic status of
blacks relative to whites has been arrested. For
some economic indicators blacks have experi-
enced a decline relative to whites, while others
reveal an absolute decline in the economic
situation of African Americans (Karoly, 1992;
Smith & Welch, 1989). The United States is not
unique. There is growing income inequality in
other western industrialized countries (Danziger
& Gottschalk, 1993), and a commensurate wid-
ening in socio-economic status (SES) differ-
ences in health (Williams & Collins, 1995).
Given the strong relationship between race
and systems of inequality, social and behavioral
scientists have emphasized that differences
between the races in socio-economic circum-
stances are centrally responsible for racial varia-
tions in health. There are large racial differences
in SES. The 1990 Census, for example, indi-
cated that compared to whites, African Amer-
icans have a median family income that is 63
percent less, are more than twice as likely to be
unemployed, three times as likely to be poor and
twice as likely not to have graduated from
college (National Center for Health Statistics,
1993). Accordingly, studies of racial differences
in health routinely control for SES and it is
336
WILLIAMS ET AL.


----- Page 3 (native text) -----
generally found that adjustment for SES sub-
stantially reduces and sometimes eliminates
racial disparities in health (Krieger et al., 1993;
Lillie-Blanton, Parsons, Gayle, & Dievler,
1996).
Although racial differences are markedly
reduced, it is frequently found that they persist
even after adjustment for SES (Lillie-Blanton et
al., 1996). Moreover, for some indicators of
SES, racial differences increase as SES increa-
ses (Krieger et al., 1993). Accordingly, several
recent critiques have emphasized that the current
paradigm of an almost exclusive focus on
differences in SES as responsible for racial
differences in health is inadequate (Cooper &
David, 1986; Hummer, 1996; Krieger et al.,
1993; Williams et al., 1994). First, SES meas-
ures are not equivalent across racial groups.
That is, there are racial differences in income
returns for a given level of education, the quality
of education, the level of wealth associated with
a given level of income, the purchasing power
of income, the stability of employment and the
health risks associated with working in partic-
ular occupations (Williams & Collins, 1995).
Thus, even when race differences in health are
‘explained’ by SES, group differences in the
very nature of SES make the interpretation of
such ﬁndings difﬁcult.
Second, it has been emphasized that SES is
not just a confounder of the relationship
between race and health, but part of the causal
pathway by which race affects health (Cooper &
David, 1986). That is, race is an antecedent and
determinant of SES, and SES differences
between blacks and whites reﬂect, in part, the
impact of economic discrimination as produced
by large-scale societal structures. Racial resi-
dential segregation is a prime example of a
societal structure that importantly restricts
socio-economic opportunity and mobility for
blacks (Massey & Denton, 1993). Third, the
conceptualization and measurement of SES is
limited. SES is too often used in a static, routine
and atheoretical manner. Finally, the persistence
of racial differences after adjustment for SES
emphasizes that race is more than SES and that
additional research attention is required to
understand the ways in which unique experi-
ences linked to race, such as non-economic
forms of racial discrimination can adversely
affect health.
At the present time it is unclear whether the
failure of SES to account completely for racial
differences in health reﬂects limitations of the
measures of SES or the failure of researchers to
consider race-related risk factors such as racial
discrimination. Enhancing our understanding of
the ways in which race and SES combine to
affect health will require research initiatives in
two directions. First, we need more compre-
hensive and theoretically informed measures of
socio-economic position. Second, we need more
concerted attention to conceptualize and meas-
ure the effects of racism on health.
Improved measurement of social
position
Much prior research on the role of socio-
economic status in racial differences in health
has used only one indicator of SES in a given
study. Currently, the extent to which limitations
in the measurement of SES accounts for the
failure of SES to account completely for racial
differences in health is not known. In particular,
the contribution of multiple indicators of SES to
racial differences in health is unclear. In addi-
tion, health researchers have recently empha-
sized the importance of including in epidemio-
logic studies theoretically driven measures of
social class to characterize fully the relationship
between social stratiﬁcation and health (Krieger
et al., 1993; Krieger, Williams, & Moss, 1997).
Current measures give greater emphasis to
Weberian notions of social stratiﬁcation than to
the Marxist emphasis on relationship to the
system of production. The Marxist view of class
emphasizes that social classes are collectivities
deﬁned in relationship to other social classes on
the basis of opposing interests. The distribution
of power and resources vary across social
classes but social classes are not primarily
gradational in the extent to which they possess
particular attributes. Wright (1985) indicates
that social classes in contemporary society are
rooted in the complex intersection of exploita-
tion based on the ownership of capital assets,
organizational assets and the possession of skill
or credential assets. From a comprehensive
battery of survey items to measure social class,
Wright (1997) has recently identiﬁed a smaller
subset of items that capture most of the variation
in the concept.

RACIAL DIFFERENCES IN PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH


----- Page 4 (native text) -----
The experience of racial bias and
health
A growing number of researchers have empha-
sized that racism is a neglected but central
societal force that adversely affects the health of
racial and ethnic minority populations (Cooper,
1993; Cooper, Steinhauer, Miller, David, &
Shatzkin, 1981; King & Williams, 1995; Krieger
et al., 1993; Williams, 1996a; Williams et al.,
1994). The term racism includes an ideology of
superiority that categorizes and ranks various
groups, negative attitudes and beliefs about
outgroups and differential treatment of out-
groups by individuals and societal institutions.
The most profound impact of racism is at the
level of societal institutions in shaping the
socio-economic opportunities, mobility and life
chances of racialized groups. The quality and
quantity of a broad range of health-enhancing
resources, including medical care, are differ-
entially distributed by societal institutions, to
members of discriminated against racial groups.
Much of the observed racial differences in SES
reﬂects the results of these processes.
In addition to discrimination at the societal
level, stressful life experiences linked to race
can also adversely impact the health of minority
populations. Stress can affect racial differences
in health in at least two ways. First, stress is not
randomly distributed in the population. It is
linked to social structure, and social status and
social roles determine both the types and quan-
tities of stress to which an individual is exposed
(Pearlin, 1989; Williams & House, 1991). The
structural location of blacks in society would
lead them to have higher levels of stress than
whites. Second, the experience of speciﬁc inci-
dents of racial bias can generate psychic distress
and lead to alterations in physiological processes
that can adversely affect health. There is grow-
ing attention to the pervasiveness and per-
sistence of racial discrimination for African
Americans (Cose, 1993; Essed, 1991; Feagin,
1991).
Descriptions of these experiences suggest that
they capture important elements of stressful
experiences that are known to be predictive of
adverse changes in health. Critiques of the stress
literature have also emphasized that the current
approaches to the assessment of stress are not
comprehensive and do not capture some of the
stressful life experiences of poor populations in
general and racial minority populations in par-
ticular (Aneshensel, 1992; Thoits, 1983). Sev-
eral studies indicate that experiences of discrim-
ination based on race or ethnicity can adversely
affect physical and mental health (Amaro,
Russo, & Johnson, 1987; Jackson et al., 1996;
James, La Croix, Kleinbaum, & Strogatz, 1984;
Krieger, 1990; Salgado de Snyder, 1987; Wil-
liams & Chung, in press). And one recent study
found that racial discrimination not only is
associated with systolic and diastolic blood
pressure but accounts for a part of the associa-
tion between race and blood pressure (Krieger &
Sidney, 1996).
Studies of the relationship between racial
discrimination and health are still in their
infancy and are subject to several limitations.
First, although experiences of racial bias are
complex and multidimensional (McNeilly et al.,
1996), the conceptualization of discrimination
has been limited in many of the studies to date
such that the phenomenon has not been com-
prehensively assessed. Some studies, for exam-
ple, have utilized only a single-item global
measure of discrimination. Second, studies have
typically focused only on major experiences of
discrimination. In contrast, Essed (1991) empha-
sizes that discrimination is a structured part of
everyday experiences and includes not only
major stressful life experiences but recurrent
indignities and irritations in everyday situa-
tions.
Third, limited attention has been given to
experiences of unfair treatment for the white
population. It has been emphasized that the
major forces affecting the health of minority
populations are important societal factors that
affect the health of the larger society on a
smaller scale and in less intensive a manner
(Cooper et al., 1981; Jackson & Inglehart,
1995). Consistent with this perspective some
evidence indicates that the experience of unfair
treatment, irrespective of race or ethnicity, may
have negative consequences for health (Harburg
et al., 1973). It is likely that African Americans
will have more frequent and more intense
experiences of unfair treatment than will whites,
but perceived racial or ethnic bias, including
perceptions of reverse discrimination, could also
adversely affect the health of whites (Jackson,
Williams, & Torres, in press). Thus, studying
the impact of experiences of unfair treatment on

the health of black and white adults can high-
light the extent to which patterns observed
among blacks are unique.
This article analyses probability sample data
from a large metropolitan area in the United
States to examine the extent to which multiple
measures of social stratiﬁcation combine with
race-related stressful experiences and more gen-
eral measures of stress to affect health and
explain racial/ethnic variations in health status.
Prior research has tended to test these major
classes of explanatory factors in isolation or in
pairs. We have multiple measures within each
class of factors and can examine how each class
performs in relation to the others. This model of
competing explanations has rarely been tested in
the literature with the breadth and range of
measures in this article.
The goals of this study are to assess the extent
to which: (1) levels of general stress and race-
related stress vary by race; (2) indicators of
socio-economic status and social class, con-
sidered singly and in combination, can account
for black–white differences in physical and
mental health; and (3) race-related stressors and
general measures of stress can account for racial
differences in health. We hypothesize that multi-
ple measures of SES will account for a large
part of racial differences in health. We also
hypothesize that the comprehensive assessment
of stress, both race-related and general sources
of stress, will play incremental roles in account-
ing for reported racial differences in health.
Methods
Sample
The data for our analyses come from the 1995
Detroit Area Study (DAS). The DAS is a
multistage area probability sample consisting of
1139 adult respondents, 18 years of age and
older, residing in Wayne, Oakland and Macomb
counties in Michigan, including the city of
Detroit. Face-to-face interviews were completed
between April and October 1995 by University
of Michigan graduate students in a research-
training practicum in survey research and pro-
fessional interviewers from the Survey Research
Center. The response rate was 70 percent. Race
was measured by respondent self-identiﬁcation.
Blacks were oversampled and the ﬁnal sample
included 520 whites; 586 blacks; and 33 Asians,
Native Americans and Hispanics. All of the
analyses reported in this article use only the
black and white respondents.
Measures and analyses
All intervally scaled measures were coded in the
direction of the variable name so that a high
score reﬂected a high value of the variable
name. Four measures of health status are used as
dependent variables in the analyses. Self-rated
ill health is a widely used general indicator of
health status that is strongly related to mortality
and other objective measures of health. It cap-
tures a respondent’s overall assessment of health
as ‘excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor’.
Psychological distress (Cronbach’s alpha 5 .86)
sums the frequency with which respondents felt
sad, nervous, restless or ﬁdgety, hopeless,
worthless and that everything was an effort in
the past 30 days. This particular measure was
recently developed as part of a project that used
modern Item Response Theory methods to iden-
tify an optimal short-form scale of non-speciﬁc
psychological distress that was equally reliable
across subsamples of the US population deﬁned
by age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, marital
status and region (Kessler & Mroczek, 1994,
1995). Bed-days, a measure of physical in-
capacitation, is a count of the number of days in
the last month that the respondent was totally
unable to work or carry out normal activities
because of both physical health problems and
emotional distress. Measures of psychological
well-being attempt to assess an individual’s
overall perception of the quality of life. Our
well-being measure combines each respondent’s
assessment of overall life satisfaction on a
5-point scale ranging from ‘completely sat-
isﬁed’ to ‘not at all satisﬁed’ with the respon-
dent’s agreement with the statement: ‘My life is
full of joy and satisfaction’ on a 4-point agree–
disagree scale.
Age (in years) and gender (1 5 female, 0 5
male) are sociodemographic control variables
used in the analyses. Race was assessed by
respondent self-report. It was coded as a dummy
variable in the regression analyses (1 5 blacks,
0 5 whites). Income and education are two
measures of socio-economic status. Our income
measure captures total household income in the
previous year. Since income is a highly skewed
variable, we used its logarithm. Because the
339
RACIAL DIFFERENCES IN PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH


----- Page 6 (native text) -----
meaning of a given level of income is related to
the number of persons in the analyses, house-
hold size is included in the analyses whenever
we analyse income. Household size is a count of
the number of persons living in the household
ranging from 1 to 6 or more. Education is
divided into four categories that capture mean-
ingful differences in educational credentials:
0–11 years, 12 years, 13–15 years, and 16 or
more years. Education is used as a set of dummy
variables in the regression analyses with 16
years or more as an omitted category.
Following Wright (1997) we classiﬁed res-
pondents into social classes based on their
pattern of responses to three questions:
1. ‘Do you hold a managerial position at your
place of employment?’
2. ‘As an ofﬁcial part of your job, do you
supervise the work of other employees, have
responsibility for or tell other employees what
work to do?’
3. ‘At your work place, do you participate in
making decisions about such things as the
products or services offered, the total number of
people employed, budgets, and so forth?’
Respondents who gave an afﬁrmative response
to all three questions were categorized as Man-
agers (n
5
224), while respondents who
answered ‘no’ to all three questions were cat-
egorized as Workers (n 5 411). Those who
answered ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the managerial ques-
tion, ‘yes’ to the supervisory question and ‘no’
to the decision-making question are Supervisors
(n 5 171). However, our preliminary analyses
revealed two additional categories that did not
perfectly ﬁt Wright’s (1997) coding instructions.
There were 154 ‘special workers’: persons who
answered ‘no’ to the supervisory and managerial
questions but ‘yes’ to the decision-making ques-
tion. There were also 102 ‘special supervisors’:
persons who answered ‘no’ to the managerial
question, ‘yes’ to the supervisory question, but
also ‘yes’ to the decision-making question.
These ﬁve categories were utilized in explora-
tory analyses and we found that for our health
outcomes, the ‘worker’ and ‘special worker’
categories, as well as the ‘supervisor’ and
‘special supervisor’ categories related similarly
to the dependent variables. Therefore, we col-
lapsed the categories and our ﬁnal social-class
measure has three categories: Worker (n 5 565);
Supervisor (n 5 273); and Manager (n 5 224).
Manager was treated as the omitted category in
our regression analyses.
Two measures of race-related stress were
utilized: discrimination and everyday discrim-
ination. Unlike prior research, both of them
were framed in the context of unfairness instead
of in the context of race. Discrimination, a
measure of major experiences of unfair treat-
ment, is a count of three items:
1. ‘Do you think you have ever been unfairly
ﬁred or denied promotion?’
2. ‘For unfair reasons, do you think you have
ever not been hired for a job?’
3. ‘Do you think you have ever been unfairly
stopped, searched, questioned, physically threat-
ened or abused by the police?’
Our second measure, everyday discrimination,
attempts to measure more chronic, routine, and
relatively minor experiences of unfair treatment
(Essed, 1991). It sums nine items that capture
the frequency of the following experiences in
the day-to-day lives of respondents: being trea-
ted with less courtesy than others; less respect
than others; receiving poorer service than others
in restaurants or stores; people acting as if you
are not smart; they are better than you; they are
afraid of you; they think you are dishonest;
being called names or insulted; and being
threatened or harassed (Cronbach’s alpha 5
.88).
Three general indicators of stress were also
utilized. Chronic stress is a count of problems in
the last month or so, with aging parents, spouse
or partner, children, hassles at work and balanc-
ing work and family demands. Financial stress is
measured by the respondent’s assessment of the
difﬁculty of meeting the family’s monthly pay-
ments on a 5-point scale ranging from extremely
difﬁcult to not difﬁcult at all. Life events is a
count of nine possible experiences in the year
prior to the interview. These include serious
illness or injury, physical attack or assault,
robbery or burglary, involuntary retirement,
unemployment, a move to a worse residence or
neighborhood, serious ﬁnancial problems, inter-
racial arguments or conﬂicts and death of a
loved one.
The data were weighted to take into account
differential probabilities of selection and to
adjust the demographics of the sample to that of

the area from which it was drawn. Simple
descriptive analyses are used to present racial
differences in the distribution of responses on
SES, social class and stress. Ordinary least
squares regression is used to estimate the size
and statistical signiﬁcance of the associations
between our independent variables and health
status.
Results
Racial differences in SES and stress
Table 1 presents the distributions of SES, social
class and stress by race. Racial differences for
all of the variables are signiﬁcant at p ≤ .05.
Blacks have signiﬁcantly higher scores than
have whites on all variables in Table 1 except
the measure of chronic stress, where the mean
for whites exceeds that for blacks. In the interest
of clarity, we present percentage differences for
meaningful categories of several of the vari-
ables. Levels of educational attainment vary by
race, with the racial gap being especially pro-
nounced at both ends of the educational distribu-
tion. Blacks are 1.6 times more likely than
whites to have completed less than 12 years of
education. There are no racial differences in the
middle of the educational distribution (high-
school graduation, some college), but whites are
almost twice as likely as African Americans to
have graduated from college. A similar pattern
is evident for income. Blacks are almost four
times as likely as whites to have a total annual
income of less than $10,000 (21% vs 6%) and
are 1.4 times more likely than whites to be in the
$10,000–$29,999 range. Equivalent percentages
of blacks and whites are in the middle-income
category ($30,000–$59,999), but whites are 2.5
times more likely than blacks to have incomes
over $60,000 (41% vs 16%). The lower average
income of blacks provides for households that
on average are signiﬁcantly larger than those of
whites. The racial distribution by social class
follows the familiar pattern noted for education
and income. Blacks are more likely than whites
to be in the worker category (61% vs 51%),
equivalent numbers of blacks and whites are
supervisors, but whites are almost twice as
likely as blacks to be managers (24% vs 13%).
Table 1 also shows differences between the
races for the stress measures. Blacks are more
likely than whites to report major experiences of
discrimination in employment and in contact
with the police. Only slightly more African
Americans than whites (29% vs 25%) report one
discriminatory event, but blacks are twice as
likely to report two discriminatory experiences
and seven times more likely to report three
experiences. Blacks also have signiﬁcantly
higher scores on the chronic ongoing indicators
of everyday discrimination, although the magni-
tude of the racial gap is not as large as for the
major experiences of discrimination. There is a
signiﬁcant racial difference on chronic stress,
with whites having higher levels of chronic
stress than blacks. Levels of ﬁnancial stress are
signiﬁcantly higher for blacks than for whites
and the average score on the life-events scale for
blacks is almost twice that of whites.

models are presented for each of the health
outcomes. The ﬁrst model shows the association
between race and health, adjusted for the demo-
graphic variables (age and gender). The next
three models consider the impact of education,
income and occupation, considered singly, while
the ﬁnal model enters the three measures of
social position simultaneously. As expected,
Table 2 shows that blacks report higher levels of
poor health than do whites. This difference is
signiﬁcant, after adjusted for age and gender and
is reduced by almost 25 percent when adjusted
for education. The race effect is dramatically
reduced when economic status is considered but
it remains signiﬁcant. Controlling for income
reduced the coefﬁcient for race by 56 percent
from the ﬁrst model. Social class is unrelated to
variations in self-reported health and makes no
contribution to explaining racial differences in
health. When all three measures of social posi-
tion are considered in Model V, the racial
difference is reduced by more than half, to
marginal signiﬁcance. When considered simul-
taneously, the association of both education and
income with health is reduced from the earlier
models, but they both remain signiﬁcant pre-
dictors of variations in self-reported ill health.
A similar pattern is evident for bed-days.
Blacks report higher levels of bed-days than do
whites. People with a high-school education or
less report higher levels of bed-days than do
college graduates. However, adjusting for edu-
cation only minimally reduces the racial differ-
ence on this health income. Income is inversely
related to bed-days and adjustment for income
reduces the coefﬁcient for race by 55 percent, to
marginal signiﬁcance. Similar to the pattern
observed for self-reported ill health, social class
is unrelated to bed-days and plays no role in
accounting for racial differences. The ﬁnal

model indicates that the racial difference in bed-
days remains marginally signiﬁcant when adjus-
ted for education, income and social class.
Instructively, unlike the pattern observed for
self-reported ill health, educational differences
disappear when adjusted for income. Thus,
income emerges as the strongest predictor or
variations in bed-days.
Table 3 presents similar models for the two
measures of mental health status—psycholog-
ical well-being and psychological distress. The
table shows that although levels of psycho-
logical well-being are unrelated to age and
gender, African Americans report lower levels
of well-being than whites do. Education is
positively related to well-being. College grad-
uates enjoy higher levels of psychological well-
being than do people with less education. More-
over, the education–well-being association ﬁts
the pattern of a linear graded relationship.
Persons in each educational category report
lower levels of well-being than do the category
just above them. The consideration of education
reduces racial differences in well-being by more
than 20 percent. The third model reveals that
there is also a strong positive relationship
between income and well-being and an inverse
relationship between well-being and household
size. Moreover, consideration of economic sta-
tus reduces racial differences in well-being by
75 percent to non-signiﬁcance. Similar to the
pattern observed earlier, social class is unrelated
to variations in well-being. The ﬁfth model
shows that when income and education are
considered simultaneously, the association of
each with well-being is reduced, but both of
them remain signiﬁcantly related to the health
outcome.
The ﬁndings for psychological distress are
also presented in Table 3. Although the coefﬁ-
cient for race is in the direction of higher levels
of psychological distress for blacks vs whites,
the coefﬁcient is not signiﬁcant in the ﬁrst
model that also includes the demographic vari-

ables. As expected, women report higher levels
of psychological distress than men do. However,
education is related to psychological distress,
with persons with 12 years of education or less
having higher levels of distress than college
graduates had. Income and household size are
also related to psychological distress. Distress
decreases with increasing levels of income, but
increases with the number of persons in the
household. Social class is related to psycho-
logical distress, with supervisors reporting
higher levels of distress than managers did. This
relationship between social class and distress is
reduced to non-signiﬁcance when adjusted for
income and education in the ﬁfth model; how-
ever, both of these variables are somewhat
reduced but remain signiﬁcantly related to dis-
tress in this ﬁnal model that considers the three
social status measures together.
Race, SES, stress and health
Table 4 shows the incremental contribution of
stress to understanding variations in levels of
self-reported ill health and bed-days. Three
hierarchical regression models are presented for
each outcome. The ﬁrst shows the relationship
between race and health, adjusted for the demo-
graphic factors, as well as, education, income
and social class. The second model considers
race-related stressors and the third adds general
measures of stress. While major experiences of
discrimination are unrelated to self-assessed ill
health, everyday discrimination is positively
related to ill health. There is a small but
signiﬁcant increase in the explained variance
from Model I to Model II. Moreover, the
adjustment for the discrimination measures
reduces the race coefﬁcient by almost 40 per-
cent, to nonsigniﬁcance. Thus, race-related
stressors make a small incremental contribution
to accounting for SES differences in self-repor-
ted ill health. The third model adds the three
general indicators of stress and consideration of
these variables produces a signiﬁcant increase in
the R2. Chronic stress is unrelated to self-
reported ill health, but both ﬁnancial stress and

major life events are positively related to ill
health. That is, higher levels of stress are
generally related with poorer health status. The
coefﬁcient for everyday discrimination is no
longer associated with ill health once adjusted
for the other measures of stress. For self-
reported health, educational differentials are
virtually unchanged when adjusted for stress. In
contrast, adjustment for general measures of
stress reduces the association between income
and self-reported health by 30 percent.
Similar to the ﬁndings for self-reported ill-
health major experiences of discrimination are
unrelated to bed-days, while everyday discrim-
ination is positively related. Adjustment for
race-related stress also reduces the marginally
signiﬁcant relationship between race and bed-
days by almost 60 percent to non-signiﬁcance.
The relationship between everyday discrimina-
tion and bed-days is reduced by over 30 percent
but remains signiﬁcant when controlled for
general indicators of stress. Of the three general
indicators, only life events is positively related
to bed-days. Both classes of stress variables
produce a signiﬁcant increase in the explained
variance with the general stress variables having
a larger impact. Similar to the pattern observed
for self-reported ill health, consideration of
stress, especially general measures of stress,
reduces the association between income and
bed-days by almost 25 percent from the ﬁrst
model. In sum, for both of the outcomes in
Table 4, the consideration of stress makes an
incremental contribution and, in combination
with SES, completely accounts for racial differ-
ences in these health outcomes.
Table 5 shows the relationship among race,
SES and stress for psychological well-being and
psychological distress. It was noted earlier that
racial differences in well-being were completely
accounted for when adjusted for income, while
race was unrelated to psychological distress. At
the same time, it was of interest to note the
relationship between stress and these indicators
of mental health status. Models similar to those
in Table 4 are presented for each of the mental

health outcomes in Table 5. Both of the meas-
ures of race-related stress are inversely related to
psychological well-being. Persons who report
higher levels of major experiences of discrim-
ination and everyday discrimination report
lower levels of psychological well-being. Con-
sideration of race-related stress produces a sub-
stantial increase in the explained variance.
Interestingly, when the two measures of race-
related stress are included in the model, the
association between race and psychological
well-being becomes positive and marginally
signiﬁcant. That is, there is a tendency for
blacks to report higher levels of psychological
well-being when race-related stressors are taken
into account. This marginally signiﬁcant pos-
itive association between race and psychological
well-being in Model II is reduced by one-third
to non-signiﬁcance when adjusted for the gen-
eral measures of stress in Model III. Chronic
stress, ﬁnancial stress and life events are all
inversely related to psychological well-being
and this set of stress measures signiﬁcantly
increases the variance explained in well-being.
When controlled for the general measures of
stress, the coefﬁcient for everyday discrimina-
tion is reduced by almost one-third, but remains
signiﬁcant, while the coefﬁcient for major
experiences of discrimination is reduced to non-
signiﬁcance. It is also instructive to note that the
relationship between education and well-being
is not markedly changed when adjusted for
stress. In contrast, the association between
income and well-being is minimally reduced
when adjusted for race-related stress but reduced
by almost one-fourth (but remained signiﬁcant)
when general measures of stress are considered.
Thus, income appears to be more closely linked
to stress-related conditions of life than does
education.
The ﬁndings for psychological distress are
similar to those observed for well-being. There
is a strong positive relationship between every-
day discrimination and psychological distress.
Persons who report that they frequently experi-
enced everyday discrimination also report
higher levels of psychological distress. Major
experiences of discrimination are unrelated to
psychological distress, but consideration of race-
related stress makes an incremental contribution
of 12 percent to the explained variance. Impor-
tantly, once the coefﬁcients for race-related
stress are included in the model the relationship
between race and psychological distress become
signiﬁcant. That is, when experiences of unfair-
ness are controlled for blacks and whites, blacks
report signiﬁcantly lower levels of psycho-
logical distress than whites do. In addition,
adjustment for race-related stress reduces the
relationship between income and psychological
distress by two-thirds. An interesting pattern is
evident for education. When adjusted for race-
related stress, the coefﬁcient for the lowest
levels of education becomes slightly stronger
while that of the second lowest level becomes
considerably weaker. The ﬁnal model for psy-
chological distress reveals that all of the indica-
tors of general stress (chronic stress, ﬁnancial
stress and life events) are positively related to
psychological distress. The association between
everyday discrimination is reduced only mod-
estly and remained signiﬁcant when adjusted for
general measures of stress.
Differential vulnerability
The data in Table 5 are consistent with the
notion that race-related stress may have a more
adverse impact on the mental health functioning
of whites as compared to blacks. When adjusted
for race-related stress, the coefﬁcient for the
association 
between 
race 
and 
well-being
changes from a non-signiﬁcant 2.08 to a mar-
ginally signiﬁcant .20 (p 5 .07). Similarly, the
association between race and psychological dis-
tress increased almost tenfold from a non-
signiﬁcant 2.11 to a signiﬁcant 21.08 (p < .01)
when race-related stress is added to the model.
That is, for both measures of mental health
status, blacks tend to experience better health
than whites do when adjusted for race-related
stress. We systematically evaluated the hypoth-
esis of racial variations in vulnerability to stress
for all of our measures of health status.
In analyses not shown, we created multi-
plicative interaction terms between race and
each of our measures of race-related and general
stress. We added these interaction terms singly
and in combination to a model that included the
demographic controls, SES, social class and
stress. We found few signiﬁcant interactions. No
interactions were evident for psychological dis-
tress and self-reported ill health. There was a
signiﬁcant interaction between race and every-
day discrimination for psychological well-being.

This measure of race-related stress was more
strongly related to well-being for whites as
compared to blacks. In contrast, both ﬁnancial
stress and life events signiﬁcantly interacted
with race in predicting bed-days such that both
of these stressors adversely affected blacks more
than whites. More careful research is needed to
identify the conditions under which the impact
of stress is exacerbated or minimized for partic-
ular subgroups in the population.
Discussion
This study has several limitations. First, the data
are cross-sectional and provide no basis for
causal directionality. At the same time, the
ﬁndings are consistent with a large body of work
that suggests that social conditions are important
determinants of variations in health. High levels
of stress and low socio-economic status are two
important social factors that have been identiﬁed
in prior research as pathogenic. Second, the
measures of discrimination utilized in this study
are based on respondent self-report. This criti-
cism is frequently raised about the measurement
of racial discrimination, although it applies to
much of the measurement of stress more gen-
erally. Considerable evidence suggests that dis-
crimination is ubiquitous in US society (Cose,
1993; Feagin, 1991; Gardner, 1995). The stress-
fulness of a life experience is determined, in
part, by the meaning it has for the individual
which is importantly linked to that individual’s
personal and social history. Thus, a respondent’s
perception and appraisal of a life experience is a
critical component of the experience of stress.
Nonetheless, strategies that have been developed
to improve the measurement of stress (Cohen,
Kessler, & Gordon, 1995), also apply to the
assessment of discrimination.
Finally, this study focused only on blacks and
whites. There is considerably more racial and
ethnic variation in the United States that is also
importantly linked to variations in SES and
health (Williams, 1996b). Recent studies ﬁnd
that other minority groups, such as Asians (Kim
& Lewis, 1994) and Hispanics (Telles & Mur-
gia, 1990) also experience discrimination.
Future research must explore the health con-
sequences of discrimination for the various
groups that make up the racial and ethnic
diversity of the US population.
At the same time, this study provides impor-
tant additional evidence of the importance of the
social environment in understanding racial
variations in health. We found racial differences
in the expected direction for three of the four
health outcomes considered. African Americans
reported lower levels of psychological well-
being; higher rates of self-reported ill health;
and more bed-days than whites did. Education
and especially income were importantly related
to all of the health outcomes examined and
played a major role in explaining racial differ-
ences in health. Social class, as measured in this
study, was generally unrelated to health and
played no role in racial differences in disease.
This pattern is inconsistent with that of a recent
study that found that social class, as measured at
both the household and community level, pre-
dicted variations in health (Krieger, 1991). More
research attention needs to be given to the
appropriate operationalization of the construct
of social class in health-related research. Our
analyses also found that race-related stress, as
well as general measures of stress, are generally
adversely related to health and make an incre-
mental contribution to explaining racial differ-
ences in health. Race-related stress was more
strongly related to our indicators of mental
health than it was to physical health.
Our measures of SES were not interchange-
able. Race-related stress was linked more
strongly to income than to education. In addi-
tion, experiences of discrimination accounted
for part of the association between income and
health. Income was also linked more strongly to
health status than to education. Krieger and Fee
(1994) have reported a similar pattern in
national data for at least some measures of
health status. Although the reasons for these
differences are not clear, they have clear policy
implications. Income is probably the component
of SES that is most amenable to change through
governmental policies, such as tax credits or
direct income supplementation, and a small
body of evidence suggests that changes in
household income can enhance health, even in
the absence of interventions in medical care
(Williams & Collins, 1995). Different indicators
of SES capture different aspects of the pathway
by which social structure affects health. More
research attention must be given to the appro-
priate conceptualization and measurement of
347

SES and the identiﬁcation of the mechanisms
and processes by which they affect health
(Krieger et al., 1997).
For both measures of mental health status, the
mental health of blacks tended to exceed that of
whites once we adjusted for race-related stress.
This pattern is consistent with the notion that
these stressful experiences may affect the health
of whites more adversely than that of blacks. A
recent review noted that for a number of child
and infant health outcomes, although blacks are
more exposed to adverse risk factors, these
factors have a larger impact on the health status
of whites than that of blacks (Williams &
Collins, 1995). Kessler (1979) documented a
similar pattern for the relationship between
stressful life events and psychological distress
for nonwhites (mainly blacks) and low SES
persons. Both of these economically disadvan-
taged groups were more exposed to stress.
However, compared to nonwhites and low SES
individuals, comparable stressful events more
adversely affected the mental health of whites
and high SES persons, respectively. Kessler
(1979) suggested some possible reasons for this
relative advantage.
First, due to earlier exposure and/or more
frequent exposure to adversity, African Amer-
icans could become more accustomed to dealing
with stress, such that a new stressful experience
has less of an impact. Second, compared to
whites, African Americans may respond to
stress with greater emotional ﬂexibility (that is,
emotional expression), which may facilitate
recovery. In addition, African Americans may
have greater access than that of whites to other
coping resources, such as religious involvement,
that some have argued may importantly reduce
the negative effects of stress (Williams, 1994).
The hypothesis that blacks cope better with
stress than whites do could shed light on an
important paradox in the literature. Compared to
whites, African Americans have higher rates of
disease and death for virtually all measures of
physical health (U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services, 1985), but they also have
equivalent or lower rates of psychiatric illness
(Kessler et al., 1994; Robins & Regier, 1991)
and lower rates of suicide (Grifﬁth & Bell,
1989). If blacks cope better with stress, there
may be a consequential trade-off. Although
effective coping may shield African Americans
from the psychological sequelae of stress, the
cumulative effects of high exposure to stress
may take a heavy physical toll and leave them
more vulnerable to a broad range of physical
ailments (cf. Geronimus, 1992). This issue
deserves careful research attention.
Our analyses also emphasize that under-
standing racial differences in health importantly
requires an appropriate theoretical framework.
Because we conceptualized race as not reﬂect-
ing biological distinctiveness, we examined
other factors (socio-economic status and stress)
that are linked to the social situation of racial
groups. A different understanding of race could
have led to a search for genetic and biological
differences. At the same time, our ﬁndings
document that the associations among race,
racism, SES and health are complex. Racism is a
part of the structure of society and arguably the
most profound health impact of racism is at the
level of societal institutions (Williams, 1996a).
Racial differences in SES reﬂect some of the
economic manifestations of racial discrimina-
tion. Cooper and David (1986) argue that since
SES is an intermediate variable in the causal
pathway between race and health, adjusting
racial differences for SES is a form of over-
control and should not be used in health studies.
Although we agree that SES is not technically a
confounder of racial differences in health, it is
an important intermediate factor. Our approach
suggests that analytic control can be usefully
employed for non-confounders. We control for
these intermediate factors, not to eliminate bias
but to facilitate an understanding of the pro-
cesses that link race (a marker of social privilege
or economic disadvantage) to health.
Although the measurement of socio-economic
position and discrimination in this study was
more comprehensive than typical, neither of
these constructs was measured perfectly in this
study. More careful conceptual work and
thoughtful empirical analyses are necessary to
take into account the complex ways in which
economic and non-economic forms of discrim-
ination relate to each other and combine with
other risk factors to affect health. Instructively,
the measure of everyday discrimination was a
more consistent and robust predictor of health
status than the measure of major experiences
with discrimination. This is consistent with the
larger stress literature which ﬁnds that stressors

that are persistent and repeated may more
adversely affect health than those that are
episodic and time limited (Lepore, 1995). Our
analyses also indicate that how SES and dis-
crimination combine to affect health importantly
depends on the health outcome under considera-
tion. This highlights the need for more research
that focuses on identifying under what condi-
tions speciﬁc aspects of social structure are
related to particular health outcomes.
In an era of waning public support and
government commitment to making the needed
investment to improve the social and economic
conditions of the most vulnerable populations in
the USA, our analyses document that race
matters a lot in terms of health. Moreover, the
sources of racial disparities are not unknown,
individual or obscure. They can be traced to
inequalities that have been created and main-
tained by the economic, legal and political
structures of society. These systems, and not
individual beliefs and behavior, are the funda-
mental causes of racial and socio-economic
inequalities in health (Williams, 1990; Williams,
in press). Eliminating these health disparities
will thus require changes in the fundamental
social systems in society.
