I. Introduction
In their classic paper on the theory of option pricing, Black
and Scholes 3 ] present a mode of analysis that has revolutionized the
theory of corporate liability pricing. In part, their approach was a
breakthrough because it leads to pricing formulas using, for the most
part, only observable variables. In particular, their formulas do not
require knowledge of either investors' tastes or their beliefs about ex-
pected returns on the underlying common stock. Moreover, under specific
posited conditions, their formula must hold to avoid the creation of
l/
arbitrage possibilities.
To derive the option pricing formula, Black and Scholes 2
assume "ideal conditions" in the market for the stock and option. These
conditions are: (1) "Frictionless" markets: there are no transactions costs
or differential taxes. Trading takes place continuously in time. Borrow-
ing and short-selling are allowed without restriction and with full pro-
ceeds available. The borrowing and lending rates are equal. 
(2) The short-
team interest tate iaknown and constant through time. (3) The stock pays no
dividends or other distributions during the life of the option. (4) The
option is "European" in that it can only be exercised at the expiration
date. 
(5) The stock price follows a "geometric" Brownian motion through
time which produces a log-normal distribution for stock price between
any two points in time.
In a subsequent, alternative derivation of the Black-Scholes
formula, Merton [18] demonstrated that their basic mode of analysis
obtains even when the interest rate is stochastic; the stock pays dividends;

and the option is exercisable prior to expiration. Moreover, it was
shown that as long as the stock price dynamics could be described by
a continuous-time diffusion process whose sample path is continuous
3/
with probability one,- 
then their arbitrage technique is still valid.
Thorp [29] has shown that dividends and restrictions against the use of
proceeds of short-sales do not invalidate the Black-Scholes analysis.
Moreover, the introduction of differential taxes for capital gains ver-
sus dividends or interest payments does not change the analysis either.4-
5/
As was pointed out in Merton,-/ the critical assumptions in the
Black-Scholes derivation is that trading takes place continously in time
and that the price dynamics of the stock have a continuous sample path
with probability one. It would be pedantic to claim that the Black-Scholes
analysis is invalid because continuous-trading is not possible and because
6/
no empirical time series has a continuous sample path. In another context,
I have shown that the continuous-trading solution will be a valid asymptotic
approximation to the discrete-trading solution provided that the dynamics
have continuous sample paths. Under these same conditions, the returns
on the Black-Scholes "no-risk" arbitrage portfolio will have some risk.
However, the magnitude of this risk will be a bounded, continuous function
of the trading interval length, and the risk will go to zero as the
trading interval goes to its continuous limit. Thus, provided that the
interval length is not "too large," the difference between the Black-Scholes
continuous-trading option price and the "correct," discrete-trading price
cannot differ by much without creating a "virtual" arbitrage possibility.
However, the Black-Scholes solution is not valid, even in the
continuous limit, when the stock price dynamics cannot be represented by
III

-3-
a stochastic process with a continuous sample path. In essence, the
validity of the B-S formula depends on whether stock price changes
satisfy a kind of "local" Markov property. I.e., in a short interval
of time, the stock price can only change by a small amount.
The antipathetical process to this continuous stock price
motion would be a "jump" 
tochastic process defined in continuous
pine. 
In essence, such a process allows for a positive probability
of a stock price change of extraordinary magnitude, no matter how small
the time interval between successive observations. Indeed, since empirical
studies of stock price series-/ tend to show far too aty outliers for
a simple, constant-variance lognormal distribution, there is a "prima
facie" case for the existence of such jumps. On a less scientific basis,
we have all observed price changes in stocks (usually in response to some
announcement) which, at least on the surface, appear to be "jumps."
The balance of this paper examines option pricing when the stock price
dynamics include the possibility of non-local changes. 
To highlight the
impact of non-continuous stock price dynamics on option pricing, all the
other assumptions made by Black and Scholes are maintained throughout
the analysis.
II. The Stock Price and Option Price Dynamics
The total change in the stock price is posited to be the com-
position of two types of changes: (1) the "normal" vibrations in price,
for examples, due to a temporary imbalance between supply and demand,
changes in capitalization rates, changes in the economic outlook, or

I 
1_1____ 
_

----- Page 5 (native) -----
-4-
other new information that causes marginal changes in the stock's value.
In essence, the impact of such information per unit time on the stock price
is to produce a marginal change in the price (almost certainly). This compo-
nent is modeled by a standard..geometric Brqwnian motion with a constant vari-
ag4e per unit Sime and it 4es a continuous 
ample path.8/ (2the,."abnorma1"
vibrations in pice are due to thq arriva1-o -impotant new information
about the stock that has more than a marginal effect on price. Usually,
such information will be specific to the firm or possibly its industry.
It is reasonable to expect that there will be "active" times in the
stock when such information arrives and "quiet" times although the "active"
and "quiet" times are random. By its very nature, important information
arrives only at discrete points in time. This component is modeled by
a "jump" process reflecting the non-marginal impact of the information.
To be consistent with the general efficient market hypothesis
of Fama [ 8] and Samuelson [26], the dynamics of the unanticipated part
of the stock price motions should be a martingale. 
Just as once the dy-
namics are posited to be a continuous-time process, the natural proto-
type process for the continuous component of the stock price change is
a Wiener process, so the prototype for the jump component is a 'isson-
9/
driven" process.-
The "'oisson-driven" process is described as follows: 
The Poisson-
distributed "event" is 
the arrival of an important piece of information
about the stock. It is assumed that the arrivals are independently and
identically distributed. Therefore, the probability of an event occuring
during a time interval of length h (where h is as small as you like) can be
III

----- Page 6 (native) -----
-5-
written as:
prob{the event does not occur in the time interval (t,t+h)} -
1 - Xh + O(h)
(1) 
prob{the event occurs once in the time interval (t,t+h)} -
Xh + O0h)
prob{the event occurs more than once in the time interval
(t,t+h)} -
O(h).
where O(h) is the asymptotic order symbol defined by *(h) - O(h) if
lim[*(h)/h] -
0, and X - the mean number of arrivals per unit time.
h+O
Given that the Poisson event occurs (i.e., some important in-
formation on the stock arrives), then there is a "drawing" from a distri-
bution to determine the impact of this information on the stock price.
I.e., if S(t) is the stock price at time t and Y is the random variable
description of this drawing, then, neglecting the continuous part, the
stock price at time t+h, S(t+h), will be the random variable S(t+h) -
S(t)Y, given that one such arrival occurs between t and (t+h). 
It is
assumed throughout that Y has a probability measure with compact support
and Y > 0. 
Moreover, the' {Y} from successive drawings are independently
and identically distributed.
As I have discussed elsewhere,- / there is a theory of stochastic
differential equations to describe the motions of continuous sample path
stochastic processes. There is 
also a similar theory of stochastic dif-
ferential equations for Poisson-driven processes.-
The posited stock
price returns are a mixture of both types and can be formally written
__

as a stochastic differential equation (conditional on S(t) -
S): Namely,
as
(2) 
dS 
(a -
k)dt + adZ + dq
where a is 
the instantaneous expected return on the stock; a2 is the
instantaneous variance of the return, conditional on no arrivals of
important new information (i.e., the Poisson event does not occur.); and
dZ is a standard Gauss-Wiener process. q(t) is 
the independent Poisson
process described in (1). 
dq and dZ are assumed to be independent. X is
the mean number of arrivals per unit time. k - e(Y-1) where (Y-l) is
the random variable percentage change in the stock price if 
the Poisson
event occurs and 
is the expectation operator over the random variable Y.
The "dZ" 
part describes the instantaneous part of the unantici-
pated return due to the "normal" price vibrations, and the "dq" part
describes the part due to the "abnormal" price vibrations. 
If 
X 
O0 (and
therefore, dq 
0 
O), 
then the return dynamics would be identical to those
posited 
in the Black and Scholes [3 
and Merton [18] papers. 
(2) can
be rewritten in a somewhat more cumbersome form as
S
(2') 
dS8 
(a - tk)dt + adz, if 
the Poisson event does not occur
-
(a - Xk)dt + adZ + (Y-l), if the Poisson event occurs,
where, with probability one, no more than one Poisson event occurs in an
instant, and if the event does occur, then (Y-l) is an impulse function

producing a finite jump in S to SY. 
The resulting sample path for S(t)
will be continuous most of the time with finite jumps of differing signs
and amplitudes occuring at discrete points in time. If a, X, k, and a
are constants, then the random variable ratio of the stock price at
time t to the stock at time zero (conditional on S(O) 
S) can be written
as
(3) 
S(t)/S -
exp[(a-1/2a 2-Xk)t + aZ(t)lY(n)
where Z(t) is a gaussian random variable with a zero mean and variance
n
equal to t; Y(n) -
1 if n 
O; Y(n) -
Y for n > 1 where the Y are in-
dependently and identically distributed and n is Poisson distributed with
parameter Xt.
In the special case when the {Y } are themselves lognormally
distributed, then the distribution of S(t)/S will be lognormal with the
variance parameter a Poisson-distributed random variable. In this form,
the posited dynamics are similar to those used by Press [22].
Having established the stock price dynamics, I now turn to
the dynamics of the option price. 
Suppose that the option price, W, can
be written as a C2 function of the stock price and time: namely, W(t) -
F(S,t). 
If the stock price follows the dynamics described in (2), then
the option return dynamics can be written in a similar form as
(4) 
dW
W 
(a

where aW is 
the instantaneous expected return on the option; o2
is 
the
instantaneous variance of the return, conditional on the Poisson event
not occuring. 
qW(t) is 
an independent Poisson process with parameter X.

(Yw-1) where (Yw-l).is the random variable percentage change in the

the expectation opera-

Using Ito's Lemma for the continuous part and an analogous
lemma for the jump part,2/ we have the following important relationships:
(5a) 
i = [1 
/2a2S2Fss(S,t) 
+ (a-Xk)SFs(S,t) + Ft+ x {F(SY,t) - F(S,t)}]/F(S,t)
(5b) 
aW =
FS(S,t)aS/F(S,t),
where subscripts on F(S,t) denote partial derivatives.
Further, the Poisson process for the option price, qw(t), is
perfectly functionally dependent on the Poisson process for the stock
price, q(t). 
Namely, the Poisson event for the option price occurs
if and only if 
the Poisson event for the stock price occurs. Moreover,
if 
the Poisson event for the stock occurs and the random variable Y takes
on the value Y -
y., then the Poisson eveht for the option occurs and the
random variable YW takes on the value, F(Sy,t)/F(S,t). 
I.e., 
YW 
*
F(SY,t)/F(S,t). Warning: even though the two processes are perfectly
dependent, they are not linearly dependent because F is a non-linear
function of S.
Consider a portfolio strategy which holds the stock, the option,
and the riskless asset with return r per unit time in proportions

0), the portfolio return could be made riskless by picking

and w 2 = w 2
so that w a + w2 aW 
O. 
This done, it must be
that to avoid arbitrage, the expected (and realized) return on the port-
folio with weights wl and w2 , is equal to the riskless rate, r. From

(7a) and (7b), this condition implies that
(8) 
(a-r)/a -
(C-r)/aW.
From (5a) (with -0), (5b), and (8), they arrive at their famous partial
differential equation for the option price. Namely,
(9) 
1/2S FsS + rSF S -
rF + Ft -
0.
Unfortunately, in the presence of the jump process, dq, the
return on the portfolio with weights w 
and w2
will not be riskless.
Moreover, inspection of (7c) shows that there does not exist a set of
portfolio weights (wl,w2 ) that will eliminate the "jump" risk (i.e., make
Yp 
1). 
The reason is that portfolio mixing is a linear operation
and the option price is a nonlinear function of the stock price. Therefore,
if Y has positive dispersion, then for any w and w2, (Yp-1) will take on non-
zero values for some possible values of Y. Since the analysis is already
in 
continuous time, the Black-Scholes "hedge" will not be riskless even
in the continuous limit.
However, one can still work out the return characteristics on the
portfolio;,where the Black-Scholes hedge is followed. Let P denote the
value of the portfolio. 
Then from (6), we have that
(10)

----- Page 12 (native) -----

Note: 
the return on the portfolio is a "pure" jump process because
the continuous parts of the stock and option price movements have been
"hedged" out. 
(10) can be rewritten n an analogous form to (2') as
(10') 
dP 
p -Xkp )dt, if the Poisson event does not occur,
-
(ap -Xkp )dt + (Y -1), if the Poisson event occurs.
From (10') it is easy to see that "most of the time," the return on the
portfolio will be predictable and yield ( 
-kp ). 
However, on average,
once every (1lA) units of time, the portfolio's value will take an unex-
pected jump. Further, we can work out further qualitative characteristics
of the return. Namely, from (7c), and (5b),
(11) 
Yp -
-
w2
[F(SY,t)- 
F(S,t) - Fs(St)SY-S)]/F(S,t).
By the strict convexity of the option price in the stock price, (F(SY,t)
-
F(S,t) - FS(S,t)(SY-S)J is positive for every value of Y. Hence, if
W2 is positive, then (Y -1) will be positive, and the unanticipated return
on the hedge portfolio will always be positive. 
If w2
< 0, then the
unanticipated return will be negative. Moreover, the sign of k 
will
be the same as the sign of w2
.
Thus, if 
an investor follows a Black-Scholes hedge where he is
long the stock and short the option (i.e., w2
< 0), then most of the time,
he will earn more than the expected return, ap, on the hedge because

kp < O. However, in those "rare" occasions when the stock price "jumps,"
he will suffer a comparatively large loss. Of course, these large losses
occur just frequently enough so as to, on average, offset the almost-
steady "excess" return, -Xkp 
Conversely, if an investor follows a
(reverse) Black-Scholes hedge where he is short the stock and long the
option (i.e., w2
> 0), then most of the time, he will earn less than
the expected return. But if the stock price "jumps,u then he will make
large positive returns.
Thus, in "quiet" periods when little company-specific informa-
tion is arriving, writers will tend to make what appear to be positive
excess returns, and buyers will "lose." 
However, in the relatively
infrequent, "active" periods, the writers will suffer large losses and the
btyers will "win." 
Of course, if arrival of an "active" period is
random, then there is no systematic way to exploit these findings. 
It
should be emphasized that the large losses suffered by writers during
"active" periods are not the result of an "underestimated" variance rate.
In general, there is no finite variance rate that could have been used
in the formula to "protect" the writer against the losses from a jump.
III. An 'Option Pricing Formula
As was demonstrated in the previous section, there is no way
to construct a riskless portfolio of stock and options, and hence, the
Black-Scholes "no arbitrage" technique cannot be employed. 
Of course, along
the lines of Samuelson [25], if one knew the required expected return
on the option (as a function of the stock price and time to expiration),

----- Page 14 (native) -----
- 13 -
then an option pricing formula could be derived. Let g(S,T) be the
equilibrium, instantaneous expected rate of return on the option when
the current stock price is S and the option expires at time T in the
future. Then, from (5a), we have that F (written as a function of time
until expiration instead of time) mast satisfy:
(12) 0 -
1/2a2S2FsS + (-k)sF S -
FT - g(S,)F + XC{F(SY,T) -
F(S,T)}
subject to the boundary conditions:
(12a) 
F(O,T) -
0
(12b) 
F(S,O) -
Max[O,S-E]
where "E" is the exercise price of the option.
Equation (12) is a "mixed" partial differential-difference equa-
tion, and although it is linear, such equations are difficult to solve.
Moreover, the power and beauty of the original Black-Scholes derivation
stems from not having to know either a or g(8,T) to compute the option's
value, and both are required to solve (12).
A second approach to the pricing problem follows along the
lines of the original Black-Scholes derivation which assumed that the
Capital Asset Pricing model-3/ was a valid description of equilibrium
security returns. 
In section II, the stock price dynamics were described
as the resultant of two components: the continuous part which is a reflection
of new information which has a marginal impact on the stock's price and

14 -
the jump part which is a reflection of important new information
that has an instantaneous, non-marginal impact on the stock. If the
latter type information is usually firm (or even industry) specific,
then it may have little impact on stocks in general (i.e., the
"market"). Examples would be the discovery of an important new oil
well or the loss of a court suit.
If the source of the jumps is 
such information, then the
jump component of the stock's return will represent "non-systematic" risk.
I.e., the jump component will be uncorrelated with the market. 
Suppose
that this is generally true for stocks. 
Return now to the P 
hedge
portfolio of the previous section. 
Inspection of the return dynamics in
equation (10) shows that the only source of uncertainty in 
the return
is 
the jump component of the stock. But by hypothesis, such components
represent only non-systematic risk, and therefore the beta" of this port-
folio is 
zero. If the Capital Asset Pricing m6del holds, then the
expected return on all zero-beta securities must equal the riskless rate.
Therefore, p 
-
r. But, from (7a), this condition implies that wl (c-r)
w2
(oW-r) - 0, or substituting for w 1
and w2
, we have that
(13) 
(c-r)/a -
(%-r)/aw.
But, (13) together with (5a) and (5b) imply that F must satisfy
(14) 0 -

subject to the boundary conditions (12a) and (12b). While (14) is
formally the same type of equation as (12), note that (14) does not
depend on either a or g(S,T). 
Instead, as in the standard Black-
Scholes case, only the interest rate, r, appears. Moreover, (14) reduces
to the Black-Scholes' equation (9) if X - 0 (i.e., if there are no
Jumps). 
It is important to note that even though the jumps represent
"pure" non-systematic risk, the jump component'does affect the equilibrium
option price. 
I.e., one cannot "act as if" the ump component was not
there and compute the correct option price.
While a complete closed-form solution to (14) cannot be
written down without a further specification of the distribution for Y,
a partial solution which is in a reasonable form for computation can be.

Define 
W(S,T;E,r,o ) to be the Black-Scholes option

From the Black and

There are two special cases where (16) can be vastly simplified.
15/
The first is the one described by Samuelsona-- where there is a positive
probability of inmmediate ruin. I.e., if the Poisson event occurs, then
the stock price goes to zero. In our notation, this case corresponds to
Y 
0- 
with probability one. Clearly, Xn 
O0 
for n 
0, and k = -1. So,
in this case, equation (16) can be written as
(17) 
F(S,t) -
e- W(Se

,r)
-
W(S,T;E,a 
2,r+X)
Formula (17) is identical to the standard Black-Scholes solution but with
a larger "interest rate," r' 
r + X, substituted in the formula. 
As was

----- Page 18 (native) -----
- 17 -
shown in Merton [18], the option price is an increasing function of
the interest rate, and therefore an option on a stock that has a positive
probability of complete ruin is more valuable than an option on a stock
that does not. This result verifies a conjecture of Samuelson.
The second special case of no little interest occurs when
the random variable Y has a lognormal distribution. Let 62 denote the
variance of the logarithm of Y, and suppose that the expected value of Y
is one (i.e., e(Y) - 1). 
Thus, given that the Poisson event occurs, the
expected change in the stock price is 
zero.-6 /
In this case, Xn
Mi]4 k have
a lognormal distribution with the variance of the logarithm of Xn
equal
to 6n and e (X )

(18) 
f (S,T)

fn(S,T) is the value of a Black-Scholes option where the "formal"1 7 / per
unit time on the stock is [a2 + n62/T]. 
If Y has a lognormal distribu-
tion, then (16) can be written as

anu-zeroo-iait as thpeoption approaches expiration. The actual value of the
option, F(S,T), is just the weighted sum of each of these option
prices where eaeh weight equals the probability that exactly n jumps
occur. I.e., F(S,T) is equal to the expected value of fn(S,T) over the
random variable n.
Formula (16) was deduced from the twin assumptions that securi-
ties are priced so as to satisfy the Sharpe-Lintner-Mossin Capital Asset
Pricing model and that the jump component of a security's return is un-
correlated with the market. While the CAPM has been extensively tested,
its validity as a descripter of equilibrium returns is still an open
18/
question.-/ To my knowledge, there have been no empirical studies of
the correlation between the jump component of stocks' returns and the
market return. So one can hardly claim strong empirical evidence to
support these assumptions.
An alternative derivation of formula (16) follows along the
lines of the Ross Z4] model4for security picing. ,Namely, suppeae ttat
the ump components of stocks' returns are contemporaneously independent.19 /
Suppose that there are m stocks outstanding and one forms a stock-option
hedge portfolio of the type described in the previous section for each
of the m stocks. If P j denotes the value of the hedge portfolio for stock
j, then from equation (10), we can write the return dynamics for this
portfolio as

Consider forming a portfolio of these hedge portfolios and the riskless
asset where xj is the fraction of the portfolio invested in the j

Suppose the unconstrained portfolio weights in the hedge port-
folios, {xj}, 
are restricted so that they can be written as xj 
Pj/m
where the j are finite constants, independent of the number of stocks,
m. 
As m becomes large, Ross calls such portfolios "well-diversified"
portfolios. 
If dsj = Bjdqj , then, dsj has an instantaneous expected value per
unit timeof 
jk j and an instantaneous variance per unit time of
X 
Var(Yj-1), where (Yj-1) is the random variable percentage change in
the jth hedge portfolio if a jump occurs in the jth stock price. By the
assumption on J j, 
the instantaneous mean and variance per unit time of

dsj are bounded and independent of m.
From (21c), we have the dqH

independent because the dqj are independent. Therefore, by the Law of
Large Numbers, 
dqH + XHkHdt with probability one as m + 
.
I.e., as
the number of hedge portfolios contained in a well-diversified portfolio
becomes large, the risk of that portfolio tends to zero, and it becomes
virtually riskless. Thus, the realized return, dH/H, will be its expected
return, odt, with probability one, and to rule out "virtual" arbitrage
aH" r. Substituting this condition into (21a), we have that, for large m,
(22) 
m J j (j-r) 
" 
0.
Since the {j) are arbitrary and (22) must hold for almost all choices
for the {Uj}, we have that, almost certainly, aj -
r, for jl, 2, . .. , m.
But, in the first derivation, it was shown that aj -
r implies that
(a-r)/a -
(oW-r)/aw [equation (13)]. 
But, equation (13) was the condition
required to obtain formula (16) as a valid equilibrium price for the option.
While the two derivations leading to formula (16) used different
assumptions, they had in common the same basic message: Namely, if the
jump component of a stock's risk can be diversified away, then the equili-
brium option price must satisfy formula (16). 
While I am not aware of
any empirical tests of this proposition, the essential test would be
whether the returns on well-diversified portfolios can reasonably be
described as stochastic processes with continuous sample paths or do
these returns contain identifiable jump components as well.

IV. 
A Possible Answer to an Empirical Puzzle
Using formula (16) and the strict convexity in the stock price
of the Black-Scholes option price formula (15), it is 
a straightforward
exercise to show that ceteribus paribus, an option on a stock with a
jump component in its return is more valuable than an option on a stock
without a jump component (I.e., [F/aX] 
> 0 at X -
0). 
However, a much
more interesting question can be posed as follows: suppose an investor
believes that the stock price dynamics follows a continuous sample-path
process with a constant variance per unit time and therefore he uses the
standard Black-Scholes formula (15) to appraise the option when the true
process for the stock price is described by equation (2). 
How will the
investor's appraised value, call it Fe(S,T), based on a misspecified
process for the stock,compare with the F(S,T) value based on the correct
process?
To make the analysis tractable, I assume the special case in
the previous section where Y is lognormally distributed with the variance
of the logarithm of Y equal to 62 and the expected value of Y equal to one.
Given the investor's incorrect belief about the stock process, it would
be natural for him to estimate the variance by using the past time series
of the logarithmic returns on the stock.
The distribution of the logarithmic returns on the stock
around the mean over any observation period, conditional on exactly n
Poisson jumps occuring during the period, is a normal distribution with
variance per unit time equal to (a2 + n62/h) where h is the length
of time between observations. 
Thus, if one observation period was an 
ex post)
1'ative'~cpaeriod 
or the :tQck and a 
pcond aq 
valtioQerperied was 
=P (fbxc
post) "quiet" period, then the investor might conclude that the variance

rate on the "perceived" process is not stationary. Moreover, there
would appear to be a "regression" effect in the variance, which has
been given as a possible explanation for certain empirical discrepancies
20/
in a test of the Black-Scholes model.-0/
However, I will assume that the investor has a sufficiently
long time series of da.:l: so that his estimate is the true, unconditional
variance per unit time of the process. Namely,
2 
2
(23) 
v (h) , 2 + 
2
= v2 
, the same for all h.
So the issue becomes if the investor uses v2
as his estimate of
the variance rate in the standard Black-Scholes formula, then how will
his appraisal of the option's value compare with the "true" solution in
formula (19)? Define the variable, for n - 0, 1, 2, . ..,
T 
a2T + n62
n
Let N be a Poisson-distributed random variable with parameter (XT) and
define T to be a random variable that takes on the value T when the
random variable N takes on the value n. Let '" denote the expectation
operator over the distribution of T. Then, the expected value of T can
be written as

I have shown elsewhere-- that

) is defined in (15); X 
SerT/E; 
T -
2T 
I adopt
the shorthand notation W(X,T') 
W(X,T' ;1O,,1).
Inspection of equation (18) shows that from (25), fn can be
rewritten as-
(26) 
fn(ST) -
Ee-W(X,T)
and from (19), that
(27) 
F(S,T) -
Ee-rTS{W(X,T)}
Moreover, from (24) and (25), the investor's incorrect appraisal can be
written as
(28) 
F (S,T) -
EeIrTw((X,).
From (27) and (28), the answer to the question as to which
formula gives the larger option price estimate will depend on whether

strictly concave function of T', then the answer would be unambiguous

where a -
n(X). At a- 0 which corresponds to S - E exp(-rT). W(x,T')
is a concave function of T', and therefore, F (S,T) > F(S,r) at that stock
price. I.e., the Black-Scholes estimate will be larger than the true
value. For small values of (rT) which would be the case for options, one
would expect by continuity,that for stock prices sufficiently near the
exercise price, this same inequality would hold. Of course, as a per-
centage difference, the difference may be small.
Similarly, for a2 >> 1, one would expect that W(X,T) would be
convex for most of the probably range of T, and in that case F(S,T) > Fe(S,T).
I.e., the Black-Scholes estimate will be smaller than the true value.
But, a2 >> 1 implies either S >> E or S << E, which makes this conjecture
intuitively correct. Namely, for deep-out-of-the-money options, there is
relatively little probability that the stock price will exceed the exer-
cise price prior to expiration if the underlying process is continuous.
However, the possibility of a large, finite jump in price significantly
improves this probability, and hence, makes the option more valuable.
Similarly, for deep-in-the-money options, there is relatively little
probability that the stock would decline below the exercise price prior
to expiration if the underlying process is continuous, and hence, the
"insurance" value of the option would be virtually nil. However, this need
not be the case with jump possibilities. Moreover, these differences will
be magnified as one goes to short-maturity options.
Of course, since both F(S,T) and Fe(S,-r) are bounded below by
(S-E) and bounded above by S, the percentage difference between F(S,T) and
Fe(S,T) cannot be large for S >> E. However, in the out-of-the-money
case, the percentage difference could be substantial.

It is interesting to note that the qualitative discrepancies
between the two formulas correspond to what practitioners often claim
to observe in market prices for options. Namely, deep-in-the-money,
deep-out-of-the-money, and shorter-maturity options tend to sell for
more than their Black-Scholes value, and marginally-in-the-money and longer-
maturity options sell for less. While to claim that the model in this
paper "explains" these discrepancies from such casual empiricisms would
be presumptuous, it does suggest a direction for more, careful empirical
research. Moreover, since the same analysis applied here to options
can be extended to pricing corporate liabilities in general,2
the
results of such further research would be of interest to all students
of Finance.
