The ¯owering plant Arabidopsis thaliana is an important model system for identifying genes and determining their functions.
Here we report the analysis of the genomic sequence of Arabidopsis. The sequenced regions cover 115.4 megabases of the
125-megabase genome and extend into centromeric regions. The evolution of Arabidopsis involved a whole-genome duplication,
followed by subsequent gene loss and extensive local gene duplications, giving rise to a dynamic genome enriched by lateral gene
transfer from a cyanobacterial-like ancestor of the plastid. The genome contains 25,498 genes encoding proteins from 11,000
families, similar to the functional diversity of Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegansÐ the other sequenced multicellular
eukaryotes. Arabidopsis has many families of new proteins but also lacks several common protein families, indicating that the sets
of common proteins have undergone differential expansion and contraction in the three multicellular eukaryotes. This is the ®rst
complete genome sequence of a plant and provides the foundations for more comprehensive comparison of conserved processes
in all eukaryotes, identifying a wide range of plant-speci®c gene functions and establishing rapid systematic ways to identify
genes for crop improvement.
The plant and animal kingdoms evolved independently from
unicellular eukaryotes and represent highly contrasting life forms.
The genome sequences of C. elegans1 and Drosophila2 reveal that
metazoans share a great deal of genetic information required for
developmental and physiological processes, but these genome
sequences represent a limited survey of multicellular organisms.
Flowering plants have unique organizational and physiological
properties in addition to ancestral features conserved between
plants and animals. The genome sequence of a plant provides a
means for understanding the genetic basis of differences between
plants and other eukaryotes, and provides the foundation for
detailed functional characterization of plant genes.
Arabidopsis thaliana has many advantages for genome analysis,
including a short generation time, small size, large number of
offspring, and a relatively small nuclear genome. These advantages
promoted the growth of a scienti®c community that has investi-
gated the biological processes of Arabidopsis and has characterized
many genes3. To support these activities, an international collabora-
tion (the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative, AGI) began sequencing
the genome in 1996. The sequences of chromosomes 2 and 4 have
been reported4,5, and the accompanying Letters describe the
sequences of chromosomes 1 (ref. 6), 3 (ref. 7) and 5 (ref. 8).
Here we report analysis of the completed Arabidopsis genome
sequence, including annotation of predicted genes and assignment
of functional categories. We also describe chromosome dynamics
and architecture, the distribution of transposable elements and
other repeats, the extent of lateral gene transfer from organelles,
and the comparison of the genome sequence and structure to that of
other Arabidopsis accessions (distinctive lines maintained by single-
seed descent) and plant species. This report is the summation of
work by experts interested in many biological processes selected to
illuminate plant-speci®c functions including defence, photomor-
phogenesis, gene regulation, development, metabolism, transport
and DNA repair.
The identi®cation of many new members of receptor families,
cellular components for plant-speci®c functions, genes of bac-
terial origin whose functions are now integrated with typical
eukaryotic components, independent evolution of several families
of transcription factors, and suggestions of as yet uncharacterized
metabolic pathways are a few more highlights of this work. The
implications of these discoveries are not only relevant for plant
biologists, but will also affect agricultural science, evolutionary
biology, bioinformatics, combinatorial chemistry, functional and
comparative genomics, and molecular medicine.
Overview of sequencing strategy
We used large-insert bacterial arti®cial chromosome (BAC), phage
(P1) and transformation-competent arti®cial chromosome (TAC)
libraries9±12 as the primary substrates for sequencing. Early stages of
genome sequencing used 79 cosmid clones. Physical maps of the
genome of accession Columbia were assembled by restriction
fragment `®ngerprint' analysis of BAC clones13, by hybridization14
or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)15 of sequence-tagged sites and
by hybridization and Southern blotting16. The resulting maps were
integrated (http://nucleus/cshl.org/arabmaps/) with the genetic
map and provided a foundation for assembling sets of contigs
into sequence-ready tiling paths. End sequence (http://www.
tigr.org/tdb/at/abe/bac_end_search.html) of 47,788 BAC clones
was used to extend contigs from BACS anchored by marker content
and to integrate contigs.
Ten contigs representing the chromosome arms and centromeric
heterochromatin were assembled from 1,569 BAC, TAC, cosmid and
P1 clones (average insert size 100 kilobases (kb)). Twenty-two PCR
products were ampli®ed directly from genomic DNA and
sequenced to link regions not covered by cloned DNA or to optimize
the minimal tiling path. Telomere sequence was obtained from
speci®c yeast arti®cial chromosome (YAC) and phage clones, and
from inverse polymerase chain reaction (IPCR) products derived
from genomic DNA. Clone ®ngerprints, together with BAC end
sequences, were generally adequate for selection of clones for
sequencing over most of the genome. In the centromeric regions,
these physical mapping methods were supplemented with genetic
mapping to identify contig positions and orientation17.
Selected clones were sequenced on both strands and assembled
using standard techniques. Comparison of independently derived
sequence of overlapping regions and independent reassembly
sequenced clones revealed accuracy rates between 99.99 and
99.999%. Over half of the sequence differences were between
genomic and BAC clone sequence. All available sequenced genetic
markers were integrated into sequence assemblies to verify sequence
contigs4±8. The total length of sequenced regions, which extend from
either the telomeres or ribosomal DNA repeats to the 180-base-pair

(bp) centromeric repeats, is 115,409,949 bp (Table 1). Estimates of
the unsequenced centromeric and rDNA repeat regions measure
roughly 10 megabases (Mb), yielding a genome size of about
125 Mb, in the range of the 50±150 Mb haploid content estimated
by different methods18. In general, features such as gene density,
expression levels and repeat distribution are very consistent across
the ®ve chromosomes (Fig. 1), and these are described in detail in
reports on individual chromosomes4±8 and in the analysis of
centromere, telomere and rDNA sequences.
We used tRNAscan-SE 1.21 (ref. 19) and manual inspection to
identify 589 cytoplasmic transfer RNAs, 27 organelle-derived
tRNAs and 13 pseudogenesÐmore than in any other genome
sequenced to date. All 46 tRNA families needed to decode all
possible 61 codons were found, de®ning the completeness of the
functional set. Several highly ampli®ed families of tRNAs were
found on the same strand6; excluding these, each amino acid is
decoded by 10±41 tRNAs.
The spliceosomal RNAs (U1, U2, U4, U5, U6) have all been
experimentally identi®ed in Arabidopsis. The previously identi®ed
sequences for all RNAs were found in the genome, except for U5
where the most similar counterpart was 92% identical. Between 10
and 16 copies of each small nuclear RNA (snRNA) were found
across all chromosomes, dispersed as singletons or in small groups.
The small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) consist of two subfamilies,
the C/D box snoRNAs, which includes 36 Arabidopsis genes, and the
H/ACA box snoRNAs, for which no members have been identi®ed
in Arabidopsis. U3 is the most numerous of the C/D box snoRNAs,
with eight copies found in the genome. We identi®ed forty-®ve
additional C/D box snoRNAs using software (www.rna.wustl.edu/
snoRNAdb/) that detects snoRNAs that guide ribose methylation of
ribosomal RNA.
A combination of algorithms, all optimized with parameters
based on known Arabidopsis gene structures, was used to de®ne
gene structure. We used similarities to known protein and expressed
sequence tag (EST) sequence to re®ne gene models. Eighty per cent
of the gene structures predicted by the three centres involved were
completely consistent, 93% of ESTs matched gene models, and less
than 1% of ESTs matched predicted non-coding regions, indicating

that most potential genes were identi®ed. The sensitivity and
selectivity of the gene prediction software used in this report has
been comprehensively and independently assessed20.
The 25,498 genes predicted (Table 1) is the largest gene set
published to date: C. elegans1 has 19,099 genes and Drosophila2
13,601 genes. Arabidopsis and C. elegans have similar gene density,
whereas Drosophila has a lower gene density; Arabidopsis also has a
signi®cantly greater extent of tandem gene duplications and
segmental duplications, which may account for its larger gene set.
The rDNA repeat regions on chromosomes 2 and 4 were not
sequenced because of their known repetitive structure and content.
The centromeric regions are not completely sequenced owing to
large blocks of monotonic repeats such as 5S rDNA and 180-bp
repeats. The sequence continues to be extended further into
centromeric and other regions of complex sequence.
Characterization of the coding regions
To assess the similarities and differences of the Arabidopsis gene
complement compared with other sequenced eukaryotic genomes,
we assigned functional categories to the complete set of Arabidopsis
genes. For chromosome 4 genes and the yeast genome, predicted
functions were previously manually assigned5,21. All other predicted
proteins
were
automatically
assigned
to
these
functional
categories22, assuming that conserved sequences re¯ect common
functional relationships.
The functions of 69% of the genes were classi®ed according to
sequence similarity to proteins of known function in all organisms;
only 9% of the genes have been characterized experimentally
(Fig. 2a). Generally similar proportions of gene products were
predicted to be targeted to the secretory pathway and mitochondria
in Arabidopsis and yeast, and up to 14% of the gene products are

The features of Arabidopsis chromosomes 1±5 and the complete nuclear genome are listed. Specialized searches used the following programs and databases: INTERPRO23; transmembrane (TM) domains
by ALOM2 (unpublished); SCOP domain database121; functional classi®cation by the PEDANT analysis system22. Signal peptide prediction (secretory pathway, targeted to chloroplast or mitochondria) was
performed using TargetP122 and http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP/.

likely to be targeted to the chloroplast (Table 1). The signi®cant
proportion of genes with predicted functions involved in metabo-
lism, gene regulation and defence is consistent with previous
analyses5. Roughly 30% of the 25,498 predicted gene products,
(Fig. 2a), comprising both plant-speci®c proteins and proteins with
similarity to genes of unknown function from other organisms,
could not be assigned to functional categories.
To compare the functional catagories in more detail, we com-
pared data from the complete genomes of Escherichia coli23,
Synechocystis sp.24, Saccharomyces cerevisiae21, C. elegans1 and
Drosophila2, and a non-redundant protein set of Homo sapiens,
with the Arabidopsis genome data (Fig. 2b), using a stringent
BLASTP threshold value of E , 10-30. The proportion of
Arabidopsis proteins having related counterparts in eukaryotic
genomes varies by a factor of 2 to 3 depending on the functional
category. Only 8±23% of Arabidopsis proteins involved in transcrip-
tion have related genes in other eukaryotic genomes, re¯ecting the
independent evolution of many plant transcription factors. In
contrast, 48±60% of genes involved in protein synthesis have
counterparts in the other eukaryotic genomes, re¯ecting highly
conserved gene functions. The relatively high proportion of
matches between Arabidopsis and bacterial proteins in the categories
`metabolism' and `energy' re¯ects both the acquisition of bacterial
genes from the ancestor of the plastid and high conservation of
sequences across all species. Finally, a comparison between uni-
cellular and multicellular eukaryotes indicates that Arabidopsis
genes involved in cellular communication and signal transduction
have more counterparts in multicellular eukaryotes than in yeast,
re¯ecting the need for sets of genes for communication in multi-
cellular organisms.
Pronounced redundancy in the Arabidopsis genome is evident in
segmental duplications and tandem arrays, and many other genes
with high levels of sequence conservation are also scattered over the
genome. Sequence similarity exceeding a BLASTP value E , 10-20
and extending over at least 80% of the protein length were used as
parameters to identify protein families (Table 2). A total of 11,601
protein types were identi®ed. Thirty-®ve per cent of the predicted
proteins are unique in the genome, and the proportion of proteins
belonging to families of more than ®ve members is substantially
higher in Arabidopsis (37.4%) than in Drosophila (12.1%) or

C. elegans (24.0%). The absolute number of Arabidopsis gene
families and singletons (types) is in the same range as the other
multicellular eukaryotes, indicating that a proteome of 11,000±
15,000 types is suf®cient for a wide diversity of multicellular life.
The proportion of gene families with more than two members is
considerably more pronounced in Arabidopsis than in other eukar-
yotes (Fig. 3). As segmental duplication is responsible for 6,303 gene
duplications (see below), the extent of tandem gene duplications
accounts for a signi®cant proportion of the increased family size.
These features of the Arabidopsis, and presumably other plant
genomes, may indicate more relaxed constraints on genome size
in plants, or a more prominent role of unequal crossing over to
generate new gene copies.
Conserved protein domains revealed more informative differ-
ences through INTERPRO25 analysis of the predicted gene products
from Arabidopsis, S. cerevisiae, C. elegans and Drosophila. Statisti-
cally over-represented domains, and those that are absent from the
Arabidopsis genome, indicate domains that may have been gained or
lost during the evolution of plants (Supplementary Information
Table 1). Proteins containing the Pro-Pro-Arg repeat, which is
involved in RNA stabilization and RNA processing, are over-
represented as compared to yeast, ¯y and worm; 400 proteins
containing this signature were detected in Arabidopsis compared
with only 10 in total in yeast, Drosophila and C. elegans. Protein
kinases and associated domains, 169 proteins containing a disease
resistance protein signature, and the Toll/IL-1R (TIR) domain, a
component of pathogen recognition molecules26, are also relatively
abundant. This suggests that pathways transducing signals in
response to pathogens and diverse environmental cues are more
abundant in plants than in other organisms.
The RING zinc ®nger domain is relatively over-represented in
Arabidopsis compared with yeast, Drosophila and C. elegans, whereas
the F-box domain is over-represented as compared with yeast and
Drosophila only. These domains are involved in targeting proteins to
the proteasome27 and ubiquitinylation28 pathways of protein degra-
dation, respectively. In plants many processes such as hormone and
defence responses, light signalling, and circadian rhythms and
pattern formation use F-box function to direct negative regulators
to the ubiquitin degradation pathway. This mode of regulation
appears to be more prevalent in plants and may account for a higher
representation of the F box than in Drosophila and for the over-
representation of the ubiquitin domain in the Arabidopsis genome.
RING ®nger domain proteins in general have a role in ubiquitin
protein ligases, indicating that proteasome-mediated degradation is
a more widespread mode of regulation in plants than in other
kingdoms.
Most functions identi®ed by protein domains are conserved in
similar proportions in the Arabidopsis, S. cerevisiae, Drosophila and
C. elegans genomes, pointing to many ubiquitous eukaryotic path-
ways. These are illustrated by comparing the list of human disease
genes29 to the complete Arabidopsis gene set using BLASTP. Out
of 289 human disease genes, 139 (48%) had hits in Arabidopsis
using a BLASTP threshold E , 10-10. Sixty-nine (24%) exceeded an
E , 10-40 threshold, and 26 (9.3%) had scores better than E , 10-100
(Table 3). There are at least 17 human disease genes more similar to
Arabidopsis genes than yeast, Drosophila or C. elegans genes
(Table 3).
This analysis shows that, although numerous families of proteins
are shared between all eukaryotes, plants contain roughly 150
unique protein families. These include transcription factors, struc-
tural proteins, enzymes and proteins of unknown function. Mem-
bers of the families of genes common to all eukaryotes have
undergone substantial increases or decreases in their size in
Arabidopsis. Finally, the transfer of a relatively small number of
cyanobacteria-related genes from a putative endosymbiotic ances-
tor of the plastid has added to the diversity of protein structures
found in plants.
Genome organization and duplication
The Arabidopsis genome sequence provides a complete view of
chromosomal organization and clues to its evolutionary history.
Gene families organized in tandem arrays of two or more units have
been described in C. elegans1 and Drosophila2. Analysis of the
Arabidopsis genome revealed 1,528 tandem arrays containing
4,140 individual genes, with arrays ranging up to 23 adjacent
members (Fig. 3). Thus 17% of all genes of Arabidopsis are arranged
in tandem arrays.
Large segmental duplications were identi®ed either by directly
aligning chromosomal sequences or by aligning proteins and
searching for tracts of conserved gene order. All ®ve chromosomes
were aligned to each other in both orientations using MUMmer30,
and the results were ®ltered to identify all segments at least 1,000 bp
in length with at least 50% identity (Supplementary Information
Fig. 1). These revealed 24 large duplicated segments of 100 kb or
larger, comprising 65.6 Mb or 58% of the genome. The only
duplicated segment in the centromeric regions was a 375-kb
segment on chromosome 4. Many duplications appear to have
undergone further shuf¯ing, such as local inversions after the
duplication event.
We used TBLASTX5 to identify collinear clusters of genes residing
in large duplicated chromosomal segments. The duplicated regions
encompass 67.9 Mb, 60% of the genome, slightly more than was

found in the DNA-based alignment (Fig. 4), and these data extend
earlier ®ndings4,5,31. The extent of sequence conservation of the
duplicated genes varies greatly, with 6,303 (37%) of the 17,193 genes
in the segments classi®ed as highly conserved (E , 10-30) and a
further 1,705 (10%) showing less signi®cant similarity up to
E , 10-5. The proportion of homologous genes in each duplicated
segment also varies widely, between 20% and 47% for the highly
conserved class of genes. In many cases, the number of copies of a
gene and its counterpart differ (for example, one copy on one
chromosome and multiple copies on the other; see Supplementary
Information Fig. 2); this could be due to either tandem duplication
or gene loss after the segmental duplication.
What does the duplication in the Arabidopsis genome tell us
about the ancestry of the species? Polyploidy occurs widely in plants
and is proposed to be a key factor in plant evolution32. As the
majority of the Arabidopsis genome is represented in duplicated
(but not triplicated) segments, it appears most likely that
Arabidopsis, like maize, had a tetraploid ancestor33. A comparative
sequence analysis of Arabidopsis and tomato estimated that a
duplication occurred ,112 Myr ago to form a tetraploid34. The
degrees of conservation of the duplicated segments might be due to
divergence from an ancestral autotetraploid form, or might re¯ect
differences present in an allotetraploid ancestor. It is also possible,
however, that several independent segmental duplication events
took place instead of tetraploid formation and stabilization.
The diploid genetics of Arabidopsis and the extensive divergence
of the duplicated segments have masked its evolutionary history.
The determination of Arabidopsis gene functions must therefore be
pursued with the potential for functional redundancy taken into
account. The long period of time over which genome stabilization
has occurred has, however, provided ample opportunity for the
divergence of the functions of genes that arose from duplications.
Comparative analysis of Arabidopsis accessions
Comparing the multiple accessions of Arabidopsis allows us to
identify commonly occurring changes in genome microstructure.
It also enables the development of new molecular markers for
genetic
mapping.
High
rates
of
polymorphism
between
Arabidopsis accessions, including both DNA sequence and copy
number of tandem arrays, are prevalent at loci involved in disease
resistance35. This has been observed for other plant species, and such
loci are thought to serve as templates for illegitimate recombination
to create new pathogen response speci®cities36. We carried out a
comparative analysis between 82 Mb of the genome sequence of
Arabidopsis accession Columbia (Col-0) and 92.1 Mb of non-
redundant low-pass (twofold redundant) sequence data of the
genomic DNA of accession Landsberg erecta (Ler). We identi®ed
two classes of differences between the sequences: single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs), and insertion±deletions (InDels). As we
used high stringency criteria, our results represent a minimum
estimate of numbers of polymorphisms between the two genomes.
In total, we detected 25,274 SNPs, representing an average density
of 1 SNP per 3.3 kb. Transitions (A/T±G/C) represented 52.1% of
the SNPs, and transversions accounted for the remainder: 17.3% for
A/T±T/A, 22.7% for A/T±C/G and 7.9% for C/G±G/C. In total, we
detected 14,570 InDels at an average spacing of 6.1 kb. They ranged
from 2 bp to over 38 kilobase-pairs, although 95% were smaller than
50 bp. Only 10% of the InDels were co-located with simple sequence
repeats identi®ed with the program Sputnik. An analysis of 416
relative insertions greater than 250 bp in Col-0 showed that 30%
matched transposon-related proteins, indicating that a substantial
proportion of the large InDels are the result of transposon insertion
or excision. Many InDels contained entire active genes not related to
transposons. Half of such genes absent from corresponding posi-
tions in the Col-0 sequence were found elsewhere on the genome of
Ler. This indicates that genes have been transferred to new genomic
locations.
Gene structures are often affected by small InDels and SNPs. The
positions of SNPs and InDels were mapped relative to 87,427 exons
and 70,379 introns annotated in the Col-0 sequence. SNPs were
found in exons, introns and intergenic regions at frequencies of 1
SNP per 3.1, 2.2 and 3.5 kb, respectively. The frequencies for InDels
were 1 per 9.3, 3.1 and 4.3 kb, respectively. Polymorphisms were
detected in 7% of exons, and alter the spliced sequences of 25% of
the predicted genes. For InDels in exons, insertion lengths divisible
by three are prevalent for small insertions (, 50 bp), indicating that
many proteins can withstand small insertions or deletions of amino
acids without loss of function.
Our analyses show that sequence polymorphisms between acces-
sions of Arabidopsis are common, and that they occur in both
coding and non-coding regions. We found evidence for the reloca-
tion of genes in the genome, and for changes in the complement of
transposable elements. The data presented here are available at

Comparison of Arabidopsis and other plant genera
Comparative genetic mapping can reveal extensive conservation of
genome organization between closely related species37,38. The com-
parative analysis of plant genome microstructure reveals much
about the evolution of plant genomes and provides unprecedented
opportunities for crop improvement by establishing the detailed
structures of, and relationships between, the genomes of crops and
Arabidopsis.
ThelineagesleadingtoArabidopsisandCapsellarubella(shepherd's
purse) diverged between 6.2 and 9.8 Myr ago, and the gene content
and genome organization of C. rubella is very similar to that of
Arabidopsis39, including the large-scale duplications. Alignment of
Arabidopsis complementary DNA and ESTsequences with genomic
DNA sequences of Arabidopsis and C. rubella showed conservation
of exon length and intron positions. Coding sequences predicted
from these alignments differed from the annotated Arabidopsis gene
sequences in two out of ®ve cases.
The ancestral lineages of Arabidopsis and the Brassica (cabbage
and mustard) genera diverged 12.2±19.2 Myr ago40. Brassica genes
show a high level of nucleotide conservation with their Arabidopsis
orthologues, typically more than 85% in coding regions40. The
structure of Brassica genomes resembles that of Arabidopsis, but
with extensive triplication and rearrangement41, and extensive
divergence of microstructure (Supplementary Information Fig. 3).
The divergence between the genomes of Arabidopsis and Brassica
oleracea is in striking contrast to that observed between Arabidopsis
and C. rubella, although the time since divergence is only twofold
greater. This accelerated rate of change in triplicated segments of the
genome of B. oleracea indicates that polyploidy fosters rapid
chromosomal evolution.
The Arabidopsis and tomato lineages diverged roughly 150 Myr
ago, and comparative sequence analysis of segments of their
genomes has revealed complex relationships34. Four regions of the
Arabidopsis genome are related to each other and to one region in
the tomato genome, suggesting that two rounds of duplication may
have occurred in the Arabidopsis lineage. The extensive duplication
described here supports the proposal that the more recent of these
duplications, estimated to have occurred ,112 Myr ago, was the
result of a polyploidization event. The lineages of Arabidopsis and
rice diverged ,200 Myr ago42. Three regions of the genome of
Arabidopsis were related to each other and to one region in the rice
genome, providing further evidence for multiple duplication
events43,44.
The frequent occurrence of tandem gene duplications and the
apparent deletion of single genes, or small groups of adjacent genes,
from duplicated regions suggests that unequal crossing over may be
a key mechanism affecting the evolution of plant genome micro-
structure. However, the segmental inversions and gene transloca-
tions in the genomes of both rice and B. oleracea that are not found
in Arabidopsis indicate that additional mechanisms may be
involved40.
Integration of the three genomes in the plant cell
The three genomes in the plant cellÐthose of the nucleus, the
plastids (chloroplasts) and the mitochondriaÐdiffer markedly in
gene number, organization and stability. Plastid genes are densely
packed in an order highly conserved in all plants45, whereas
mitochondrial genes46 are widely dispersed and subjected to exten-
sive recombination.
Organellar genomes are remnants of independent organismsÐ
plastids are derived from the cyanobacterial lineage and mitochon-
dria from the a-Proteobacteria. The remaining genes in plastids
include those that encode subunits of the photosystem and the
electron transport chain, whereas the genes in mitochondria encode
essential subunits of the respiratory chain. Both organelles contain
sets of speci®c membrane proteins that, together with housekeeping
proteins, account for 61% of the genes in the chloroplast and 88 %
in the mitochondrion (Table 4). The balances are involved in
transcription and translation.

in organelles was predicted using default settings on TargetP
(Table 1). Many nuclear gene products that are targeted to either
(or both) organelles were originally encoded in the organelle
genomes and were transferred to the nuclear genome during
evolutionary history. A large number also appear to be of eukaryotic
origin, with functions such as protein import components, which
were probably not required by the free-living ancestors of the
endosymbionts.
To identify nuclear genes of possible organellar ancestry, we
compared all predicted Arabidopsis proteins to all proteins from
completed genomes including those from plastids and mitochon-
dria (Supplementary Information Table 2). This search identi®ed
proteins encoded by the Arabidopsis nuclear genome that are most
similar to proteins encoded by other species' organelle genomes (14
mitochondrial and 44 plastid). These represent organelle-to-
nuclear gene transfers that have occurred sometime after the
divergence of the organelle-containing lineages47. There is a great
excess of nuclear encoded proteins most similar to proteins from the
cyanobacteria Synechocystis (Supplementary Information Fig. 4;
806 Arabidopsis predicted proteins matching 404 different Synecho-
cystis proteins, providing further evidence of a genome duplica-
tion). These 806 Arabidopsis predicted proteins, and many others of
greatly diverse function, are possibly of plastid descent. Through
searches against proteins from other cyanobacteria (with incom-
pletely sequenced genomes), we identi®ed 69 additional genes of
possibly plastid descent. Only 25% of these putatively plastid-
derived proteins displayed a target peptide predicted by TargetP,
indicating potential cytoplasmic functions for most of these genes.
The difference between predicted plastid-targeted and predicted
plastid-derived genes indicates that there is a probable overestima-
tion by ab initio targeting prediction methods and a lack of
resolution with respect to destination organelles, the possible
extensive divergence of some endosymbiont-derived genes in the
nuclear genome, the co-opting of nuclear genes for targeting to
organelles, and cytoplasmic functions for cyanobacteria-derived
proteins. Clearly more re®ned tools and extensive experimentation
is required to catalogue plastid proteins.
The transfer of genes between genomes still continues (Supple-
mentary Information Table 3). Plastid DNA insertions in the
nucleus (17 insertions totalling 11 kb) contain full-length genes
encoding proteins or tRNAs, fragments of genes and an intron as
well as intergenic regions. Subsequent reshuf¯ing in the nucleus is
illustrated by the atpH gene, which was originally transferred
completely, but is now in two pieces separated by 2 kb. The 13
small mitochondrial DNA insertions total 7 kb in addition to the
large insertion close to the centromere of chromosome 2 (ref. 3).
The high level of recombination in the mitochondrial genome may
account for these events.
Transposable elements
Transposons, which were originally identi®ed in maize by Barbara
McClintock, have been found in all eukaryotes and prokaryotes. A
subset of transposons replicate through an RNA intermediate (class
I), whereas others move directly through a DNA form (class II).
Transposons are further classi®ed by similarity either between their
mobility genes or between their terminal and/or internal motifs, as
well as by the size and sequence of their target site. Internally deleted
elements can often be mobilized in trans by fully functional
elements.
Transposons in Arabidopsis account for at least 10% of the
genome,
or
about
one-®fth
of
the
intergenic
DNA.
The
Arabidopsis genome has a wealth of class I (2,109) and II
(2,203) elements, including several new groups (1,209 elements;
Supplementary Information Table 4). Mobile histories for many
elements were obtained by identifying regions of the genome with
signi®cant similarity to `empty' target sites (RESites) thus providing
high-resolution information concerning the termini and target site
duplications48,49. These regions were readily detected because of the
propensity of transposons to integrate into repeats and because of
duplications in the genome sequence. In several cases, genes appear
to have been included as `passengers' in transposable units48. In
some cases, shared sequence similarity, coding capacity and RESites
attest to recent activity of transposable elements in the Arabidopsis
genome. Only about 4% of the complete elements identi®ed
correspond to an EST, however, suggesting that most are not
transcribed.
Transposable elements found in many other plant genomes are
well represented in Arabidopsis, including copia- and gypsy-like long
terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons, long interspersal nuclear
elements (LINEs); short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs),
hobo/Activator/Tam3 (hAT)-like elements, CACTA-like elements
and miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITES).
Although usually small in size, some larger Tourist-like MITEs
contain open reading frames (ORFs) with similarity to the trans-
posases of bacterial insertion sequences48. Basho and many Mutator-
like elements (MULEs), ®rst discovered in the Arabidopsis sequence,
represent structurally unique transposons48±50. Basho elements have
a target site preference for mononucleotide `A' and wide distribution
among plants48,51. MULEs exhibit a high level of sequence diversity
and members of most groups lack long terminal inverted repeats
(TIRs). Phylogenetic analysis of the Arabidopsis MURA-like trans-
posases suggests that TIR-containing MULEs are more closely
related to one another than to MULEs lacking TIRs49,52.
For many plants with large genomes, class I retrotransposons
contribute most of the nucleotide content53. In the small Arabidopsis
genome, class I elements are less abundant and primarily occupy the
centromere. In contrast, Basho elements and class II transposons
such as MITEs and MULEs predominate on the periphery of
pericentromeric domains (Fig. 5). In class II transposons, MULEs
and CACTA elements are clustered near centromeres and hetero-
chromatic knobs, whereas MITEs and hAT elements have a less
pronounced bias. The distribution pattern of transposable elements
observed in Arabidopsis may re¯ect different types of pericentro-
meric heterochromatin regions and may be similar to those found
in animals.
Numerous centromeric satellite repeats are located between
each chromosome arm and have not yet been sequenced, but
are represented in part by unanchored BAC contigs (R. Martienssen
and M. Marra, unpublished data). End sequence suggests that these
domains contain many more class I than class II elements, con-
sistent with the distribution reported here (K. Lemcke and R.
Martienssen, unpublished data). We do not know the signi®cance
of the apparent paucity of elements in telomeric regions and in the
region ¯anking the rDNA repeats on chromosome 4 (but not on
chromosome 2).
Overall, transposon-rich regions are relatively gene-poor and
have lower rates of recombination and EST matches, indicating a
correlation between low gene expression, high transposon density
and low recombination51. The role of transposons in genome

rDNA, telomeres and centromeres
Nucleolar organizers (NORs) contain arrays of unit repeats encod-
ing the 18S, 5.8S and 25S ribosomal RNA genes and are transcribed
by RNA polymerase I. Together with 5S RNA, which is transcribed
by RNA polymerase III, these rRNAs form the structural and
catalytic cores of cytoplasmic ribosomes. In Arabidopsis, the
NORs juxtapose the telomeres of chromosomes 2 and 4, and
comprise uninterrupted 18S, 5.8S and 25S units all orientated on
the chromosomes in the same direction54. In contrast, the 5S rRNA
genes are localized to heterogeneous arrays in the centromeric
regions of chromosomes 3, 4 and 5 (ref. 55; and Fig. 6). Both
NORs are roughly 3.5±4.0 megabase-pairs and comprise ,350±400
highly methylated rRNA gene units, each ,10 kb (ref. 54). The
sequence between the euchromatic arms and NORs has been
determined. Elsewhere in the genome, only one other 18S, 5.8S,
25S rRNA gene unit was identi®ed in centromere 3. Although minor
variations in sequence length and composition occur in the NOR
repeats, these variants are highly clustered, supporting a model of
sequence maintenance through concerted evolution55.
Arabidopsis telomeres are composed of CCCTAAA repeats and
average ,2±3 kb (ref. 56). For TEL4N (telomere 4 North), con-
sensus repeats are adjacent to the NOR; the remaining telomeres are
typically separated from coding sequences by repetitive subtelo-
meric regions measuring less than 4 kb. Imperfect telomere-like
arrays of up to 24 kb are found elsewhere in the genome, particularly
near centromeres. These arrays might affect the expression of nearby
genes and may have resulted from ancient rearrangements, such as
inversions of the chromosome arms.
Centromere DNA mediates chromosome attachment to the
meiotic and mitotic spindles and often forms dense heterochroma-
tin. Genetic mapping of the regions that confer centromere function
provided the markers necessary to precisely place BAC clones at
individual centromeres17; 69 clones were targeted for sequencing,
resulting in over 5 Mb of DNA sequence from the centromeric
regions. The unsequenced regions of centromeres are composed
primarily of long, homogeneous arrays that were characterized
previously with physical57 and genetic mapping17 and contain over
3 Mb of repetitive arrays, including the 180-bp repeats and 5S
rDNA51 (Fig. 6).
Arabidopsis centromeres, like those of many higher eukaryotes,
contain numerous repetitive elements including retroelements,
transposons, microsatellites and middle repetitive DNA17. These
repeats are rare in the euchromatic arms and often most abundant
in pericentromeric DNA. The repeats, af®nity for DNA-binding
dyes, dense methylation patterns and inhibition of homologous
recombination indicate that the centromeric regions are highly
heterochromatic, and such regions are generally viewed as very
poor environments for gene expression. Unexpectedly, we found at
least 47 expressed genes encoded in the genetically de®ned centro-
meres of Arabidopsis (http://preuss.bsd.uchicago.edu/arabidopsis.
genome.html). In several cases, these genes reside on islands of
unique sequence ¯anked by repetitive arrays, such as 180-bp or 5S
rDNA repeats. Among the genes encoded in the centromeres are
members of 11 of the 16 functional categories that comprise the
proteome. The centromeres are not subject to recombination;
consequently, genes residing in these regions probably exhibit
unique patterns of molecular evolution.
The function of higher eukaryotic centromeres may be speci®ed
by proteins that bind to centromere DNA, by epigenetic
modi®cations, or by secondary or higher order structures. A
pairwise comparison of the non-repetitive portions of all ®ve
centromeres showed they share limited (1±7%) sequence similarity.
Forty-one families of small, conserved centromere sequences
(AtCCS, see http://preuss.bsd.uchicago.edu/arabidopsis.genome.
html) are enriched in the centromeric and pericentromeric regions
and differ from sequences found in the centromeres of other
eukaryotes. Molecular and genetic assays will be required to
determine whether these conserved motifs nucleate Arabidopsis
centromere activity. Apart from the AtCCS sequences, most cen-
tromere DNA is not shared between chromosomes, complicating
efforts to derive clear evolutionary relationships. In contrast, genetic
and cytological assays indicate that homologous centromeres are
highly conserved among Arabidopsis accessions, albeit subject to
rearrangements such as inversions to form knobs5,58,59 and
insertions4. Further investigation of centromere DNA promises to
yield information on the evolutionary forces that act in regions of
limited recombination, as well as an improved understanding of the
role of DNA sequence patterns in chromosome segregation.
Membrane transport
Transporters in the plasma and intracellular membranes of
Arabidopsis are responsible for the acquisition, redistribution and
compartmentalization of organic nutrients and inorganic ions, as
well as for the ef¯ux of toxic compounds and metabolic end
products, energy and signal transduction, and turgor generation.
Previous genomic analyses of membrane transport systems in
S. cerevisiae and C. elegans led to the identi®cation of over 100
distinct families of membrane transporters60,61. We compared
membrane transport processes between Arabidopsis, animals,
fungi and prokaryotes, and identi®ed over 600 predicted membrane
transport systems in Arabidopsis (http://www-biology.ucsd.edu/
,ipaulsen/transport/), a similar number to that of C. elegans

(,700
transporters) and
over
twofold greater
than
either
S. cerevisiae or E. coli (,300 transporters).
We compared the transporter complement of Arabidopsis,
C. elegans and S. cerevisiae in terms of energy coupling mechanisms
(Fig. 7a). Unlike animals, which use a sodium ion P-type ATPase
pump to generate an electrochemical gradient across the plasma
membrane, plants and fungi use a proton P-type ATPase pump to
form a large membrane potential (-250 mV)62. Consequently, plant
secondary transporters are typically coupled to protons rather than
to sodium63. Compared with C. elegans, Arabidopsis has a surpris-
ingly high percentage of primary ATP-dependent transporters (12%
and 21% of transporters, respectively), re¯ecting increased numbers
of P-type ATPases involved in metal ion transport and ABC ATPases
proposed to be involved in sequestering unusual metabolites and
drugs in the vacuole or in other intracellular compartments. These
processes may be necessary for pathogen defence and nutrient
storage.
About 15% of the transporters in Arabidopsis are channel pro-
teins, ®ve times more than in any single-celled organism but half the
number in C. elegans (Fig. 7b). Almost half of the Arabidopsis
channel proteins are aquaporins, and Arabidopsis has 10-fold more
Mfamily major intrinsic protein (MIP) family water channels than
any other sequenced organism. This abundance emphasizes the
importance of hydraulics in a wide range of plant processes,
including sugar and nutrient transport into and out of the vascu-
lature, opening of stomatal apertures, cell elongation and epinastic
movements of leaves and stems. Although Arabidopsis has a diverse
range of metal cation transporters, C. elegans has more, many of
which function in cell±cell signalling and nerve signal transduction.
Arabidopsis also possesses transporters for inorganic anions such as
phosphate, sulphate, nitrate and chloride, as well as for metal cation
channels that serve in signal transduction or cell homeostasis.
Compared with other sequenced organisms, Arabidopsis has 10-
fold more predicted peptide transporters, primarily of the proton-
dependent oligopeptide transport (POT) family, emphasizing the
importance of peptide transport or indicating that there is broader
substrate speci®city than previously realized. There are nearly 1,000
Arabidopsis genes encoding Ser/Thr protein kinases, suggesting that
peptides may have an important role in plant signalling64.
Virtually no transporters for carboxylates, such as lactate and
pyruvate, were identi®ed in the Arabidopsis genome. About 12% of
the transporters were predicted to be sugar transporters, mostly
consisting of paralogues of the MFS family of hexose transporters.
Notably, S. cerevisiae, C. elegans and most prokaryotes use
APC family transporters as their principle means of amino-acid
transport, but Arabidopsis appears to rely primarily on the AAAP
family of amino-acid and auxin transporters. More than 10% of the
transporters in Arabidopsis are homologous to drug ef¯ux pumps;
these probably represent transporters involved in the sequestration
into vacuoles of xenobiotics, secondary metabolites, and breakdown
products of chlorophyll.
Surprisingly, Arabidopsis has close homologues of the human
ABC TAP transporters of antigenic peptides for presentation to the
major histocompatability complex (MHC). In Arabidopsis, these
transporters may be involved in peptide ef¯ux, or more specula-
tively, in some form of cell-recognition response. Arabidopsis also
has 10-fold more members of the multi-drug and toxin extrusion
(MATE) family than any other sequenced organism; in bacteria,
these transporters function as drug ef¯ux pumps. Curiously,
Arabidopsis has several homologues of the Drosophila RND trans-
porter family Patched protein, which functions in segment polarity,
and more than ten homologues of the Drosophila ABC family eye
pigment transporters. In plants, these are presumably involved in
intracellular sequestration of secondary metabolites.
DNA repair and recombination
DNA repair and recombination pathways have many functions in
different species such as maintaining genomic integrity, regulating
mutation rates, chromosome segregation and recombination,
genetic exchange within and between populations, and immune
system development. Comparing the Arabidopsis genome with
other species65 indicates that Arabidopsis has a similar set of DNA
repair and recombination (RAR) genes to most other eukaryotes.
The pathways represented include photoreactivation, DNA ligation,
non-homologous end joining, base excision repair, mismatch
excision repair, nucleotide excision repair and many aspects of
DNA recombination (Supplementary Information Table 5). The
Arabidopsis RAR genes include homologues of many DNA repair
genes that are defective in different human diseases (for example,
hereditary breast cancer and non-polyposis colon cancer, xero-
derma pigmentosum and Cockayne's syndrome).
One feature that sets Arabidopsis apart from other eukaryotes is
the presence of additional homologues of many RAR genes. This is
seen for almost every major class of DNA repair, including recom-
bination (four RecA), DNA ligation (four DNA ligase I), photo-
reactivation (one class II photolyase and ®ve class I photolyase
homologues) and nucleotide excision repair (six RPA1, two RPA2,
two Rad25, three TFB1 and four Rad23). This is most striking for
genes with probable roles in base excision repair. Arabidopsis
encodes 16 homologues of DNA base glycosylases (enzymes that

recognize abnormal DNA bases and cleave them from the sugar-
phosphate backbone)Ðmore than any other species known. This
includes several homologues of each of three families of alkylation
damage base glycosylases: two of the S. cerevisiae MPG; six of the E.
coli TagI; and two of the E. coli AlkA. Arabidopsis also encodes three
homologues of the apurinic-apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease Xth.
AP endonucleases continue the base excision repair started by
glycosylases by cleaving the DNA backbone at abasic sites.
Evolutionary analysis indicates that some of the extra copies of
RAR genes in Arabidopsis originated through relatively recent gene
duplicationsÐbecause many of the sets of genes are more closely
related to each other than to their homologues in any other species.
As duplication is frequently accompanied by functional divergence,
the duplicate (paralogous) genes may have different repair speci®-
cities or may have evolved functions that are outside RAR functions
(as is the case for two of the ®ve class I photolyase homologues,
which function as blue-light receptors). In most cases, it is not
known whether the paralogous gene copies have different functions.
The presence of multiple paralogues might also allow functional
redundancy or a greater repair or recombination capacity.
The multiplicity of RAR genes in Arabidopsis is also partly due to
the transfer of genes from the organellar genomes to the nucleus.
Repair gene homologues that appear to be of chloroplast origin
(Supplementary Information Tables 2 and 5) include the recombi-
nation proteins RecA, RecG and SMS, two class I photolyase
homologues, Fpg, two MutS2 proteins, and the transcription-
repair coupling factor Mfd. Two of these (RecA and Fpg) are
involved in RAR functions in the plastid, suggesting that the
others may be as well. The ®nding of an Mfd orthologue of
cyanobacterial descent is surprising. In E. coli, Mfd couples nucleo-
tide excision repair carried out by UvrABC to transcription, leading
to the rapid repair of DNA damage on the transcribed strand of
transcribed genes66 The absence of orthologues of UvrABC in
Arabidopsis renders the function of Mfd dif®cult to predict. The
presence of Mfd but not UvrABC has been reported for only one
other species, a bacterial endosymbiont of the pea aphid.
Other nuclear-encoded Arabidopsis DNA repair gene homolo-
gues are evolutionarily related to genes from a-Proteobacteria, and
thus may be of mitochondrial descent. In particular, the six homo-
logues of the alkyl-base glycosylase TagI appear to be the result of a
large expansion in plants after transfer from the mitochondrial
genome. Whether any of these TagI homologues function in the
repair and maintenance of mitochondrial DNA has not been
determined. More detailed phylogenetic analysis may reveal addi-
tional Arabidopsis RAR genes to be of organellar ancestry.
There are some notable absences of proteins important for RAR
in other species, including alkyltransferases, MSH4, RPA3 and many
components of TFIIH (TFB2, TFB3, TFB4, CCL1, Kin28). Never-
theless, Arabidopsis shows many similarities to the set of DNA repair
genes found in other eukaryotes, and therefore offers an experi-
mental system for determining the functions of many of these
proteins, in part through characterization of mutants defective in
DNA repair67.
Gene regulation
Eukaryotic gene expression involves many nuclear proteins that
modulate chromatin structure, contribute to the basal transcription
machinery, or mediate gene regulation in response to developmen-
tal, environmental or metabolic cues. As predicted by sequence
similarity, more than 3,000 such proteins may be encoded by the
Arabidopsis genome, suggesting that it has a comparable complexity
of gene regulation to other eukaryotes. Arabidopsis has an additional
level of gene regulation, however, with DNA methylation potentially
mediating gene silencing and parental imprinting.
Plants have evolved several variations on chromatin remodelling
proteins, such as the family of HD2 histone deacetylases68. Although
Arabidopsis possesses the usual number of SNF2-type chromatin
remodelling ATPases, which regulate the expression of nearly all
genes, there are signi®cant structural differences between yeast and
metazoan SNF2-type genes and their orthologues in Arabidopsis.
DDM1, a member of the SNF2 superfamily, and MOM1, a gene with
similarity to the SNF2 family, are involved in transcriptional gene
silencing in Arabidopsis. MOM1 has no clear orthologue in fungal or
metazoan genomes.
Consistent with its methylated DNA, Arabidopsis possesses
eight DNA methyltransferases (DMTs). Two of the three types
are orthologous to mammalian DMT69 whereas one, chromo-
methyltransferase70, is unique to plants. No DMTs are found in
yeast or C. elegans, although two DMT-like genes are found in
Drosophila71. Arabidopsis also encodes eight proteins with methyl-
DNA-binding domains (MBDs). Despite lacking methylated DNA,
Drosophila encodes four MBD proteins and C. elegans has two.

control of gene expression in eukaryotes (Supplementary Informa-
tion Table 6; http://Ag.Arizona.Edu/chromatin/chromatin.html).
The Arabidopsis genome encodes transcription machinery for the
three nuclear DNA-dependent RNA polymerase systems typical of
eukaryotes (Supplementary Information Table 6). Transcription by
RNA polymerases II and III appears to involve the same machinery
as is used in other eukarotes; however, most transcription factors for
RNA polymerase I are not readily identi®ed. Only two polymerase I
regulators (other than polymerase subunits and TATA-binding
protein) are apparent in Arabidopsis, namely homologues of yeast
RRN3 and mouse TTF-1. All eukaryotes examined to date have
distinct genes for the largest and second largest subunits of poly-
merase I, II and III. Unexpectedly, Arabidopsis has two genes
encoding a fourth class of largest subunit and second-largest
subunit (Supplementary Information Fig. 5). It will be interesting
to determine whether the atypical subunits comprise a polymerase
that has a plant-speci®c function. Four genes encoding single-
subunit plastid or mitochondrial RNA polymerases have been
identi®ed in Arabidopsis (Supplementary Information Table 6).
Genes for the bacterial b-, b9- and a-subunits of RNA polymerase
are also present, as are homologues of various s-factors, and these
proteins may regulate chloroplast gene expression. Mutations in the
Sde-1 gene, encoding RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp),
lead to defective post-transcriptional gene silencing72. We also
identi®ed ®ve more closely related RdRp genes.
Our analysis, using both similarity searches and domain matches,
has identi®ed 1,709 proteins with signi®cant similarity to known
classes of plant transcription factors classi®ed by conserved DNA-
binding domains. This analysis used a consistent conservative
threshold that probably underestimates the size of families of
diverse sequence. This class of protein is the least conserved
among all classes of known proteins, showing only 8±23% similar-
ity to transcription factors in other eukaryotes (Fig. 2b). This
reduced similarity is due to the absence of certain classes of
transcription factors in Arabidopsis and large numbers of plant-
speci®c transcription factors. We did not detect any members of
several widespread families of transcription factors, such as the REL
(Rel-like DNA-binding domain) homology region proteins, nuclear
steroid receptors and forkhead-winged helix and POU (Pit-1, Oct-
and Unc-8b) domain families of developmental regulators. Con-
versely, of 29 classes of Arabidopsis transcription factors, 16 appear
to be unique to plants (Supplementary Information Table 6).
Several of these, such as the AP2/EREBP-RAV, NAC and ARF-
AUX/IAA families, contain unique DNA-binding domains, whereas
others contain plant-speci®c variants of more widespread domains,
such as the DOF and WRKY zinc-®nger families and the two-repeat
MYB family.
Functional redundancy among members of large families of
closely related transcription factors in Arabidopsis is a signi®cant
potential barrier to their characterization73. For example, in the

SHATTERPROOF and SEPALLATA families of MADS box tran-
scription factors, all genes must be defective to produce visible
mutant phenotypes74,75. These functionally redundant genes are
found on the segmental duplications described above. Our analyses,
together with the signi®cant sequence similarity found in large
families of transcription factors such as the R2R3-repeat MYB and
WRKY families, suggest that strategies involving overexpression will
be important in determining the functions of members of tran-
scription factor families.
Arabidopsis has two or over three times more transcription factors
than identi®ed in Drosophila29 or C.elegans1, respectively. The sig-
ni®cantly greater extent of segmental chromosomal and local tandem
duplications in the Arabidopsis genome generates larger gene families,
including transcription factors. The partly overlapping functions
de®ned for a few transcription factors are also likely to be much
more widespread, implicating many sequence-related transcription
factors in the same cellular processes. Finally, the expanded number
of genes involved in metabolism, defence and environmental inter-
action in Arabidopsis (Fig. 2a), which have few counterparts in
Drosophila and C. elegans, all require additional numbers and classes
of transcription factors to integrate gene function in response to a
vast range of developmental and environmental cues.
Cellular organization
Plant cells differ from animal cells in many features such as plastids,
vacuoles, Golgi organization, cytoskeletal arrays, plasmodesmata
linking cytoplasms of neighbouring cells, and a rigid polysacchar-
ide-rich extracellular matrixÐthe cell wall. Because the cell wall
maintains the position of a cell relative to its neighbours, both
changes in cell shape and organized cell divisions, involving cytos-
keleton reorganization and membrane vesicle targeting, have major
roles in plant development. Plant cytokinesis is also unique in
that the partitioning membrane is formed de novo by vesicle fusion.
We compared the Arabidopsis genome with those of C. elegans,
Drosophila and yeast to glimpse the genetic basis of plant-cell-
speci®c features.
The principal components of the plant cytoskeleton are micro-
tubules (MTs) and actin ®laments (AFs); intermediate ®laments
(IFs) have not been described in plants. Arabidopsis appears to lack
genes for cytokeratin or vimentin, the main components of animal
IFs, but has several variants of actin, a- and b-tubulin. The
Arabidopsis genome also encodes homologues of chaperones that
mediate the folding of tubulin and actin polypeptides in yeast and
animal cells, such as the prefoldin and cytosolic chaperonin com-
plexes and tubulin-folding cofactors. The dynamic stability of MTs
and AFs is in¯uenced by MT-associated proteins and actin-binding
proteins, respectively, several of which are encoded by Arabidopsis
genes. These include the MT-severing ATPase katanin, AF-cross-
linking/bundling proteins, such as ®mbrins and villins, and AF-
disassembling proteins, such as pro®lin and actin-depolymerizing
factor/co®lin. The Arabidopsis proteome appears to lack homolo-
gues of proteins that, in animal cells, link the actin cytoskeleton
across the plasma membrane to the extracellular matrix, such as
integrin, talin, spectrin, a-actinin, vitronectin or vinculin. This
apparent lack of `anchorage' proteins is consistent with the different
composition of the cell wall and with a prominence of cortical MTs
at the expense of cortical AFs in plant cells.
Plant-speci®c cytoskeletal arrays include interphase cortical MTs
mediating cell shape, the preprophase band marking the cortical site
of cell division, and the phragmoplast assisting in cytokinesis76.
Although plant cells lack structural counterparts of the yeast spindle
pole body and the animal centrosome, Arabidopsis has homologues
of core components of the MT-nucleating g-tubulin ring complex,
such as g-tubulin, Spc97/hGCP2 and Spc98/hGCP3. Arabidopsis
has numerous motor molecules, both kinesins and dyneins with
associated dynactin complex proteins, which are presumably
involved in the dynamic organization of MTs and in transporting
cargo along MT tracks. There are also myosin motors that may be
involved in AF-supported organelle traf®cking. Essential features of
the eukaryotic cytoskeleton appear to be conserved in Arabidopsis.
The Arabidopsis genome encodes homologues of proteins
involved in vesicle budding, including several ARFs and ARF-
related small G-proteins, large but not small ARF GEFs (adenosine
ribosylation factor on guanine nucleotide exchange factor), adapter
proteins, and coat proteins of the COP and non-COP types.
Arabidopsis also has homologues of proteins involved in vesicle
docking and fusion, including SNAP receptors (SNAREs), N-
ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) and Cdc48-related ATPases,
accessory proteins such as Sec1 and soluble NSF attachment protein
(SNAP), and Rab-type GTPases. The large number of Arabidopsis
SNAREs can be grouped by sequence similarity to yeast and animal
counterparts involved in speci®c traf®cking pathways, and some
have been localized to the trans-Golgi and the pre-vacuolar
pathway77. Arabidopsis also has a receptor for retention of proteins
in the endoplasmic reticulum, a cargo receptor for transport to the
vacuole and several phragmoplastins related to animal dynamin
GTPases. Thus, plant cells appear to use the same basic machinery
for vesicle traf®cking as yeast and animal cells.
Animal cells possess many functionally diverse small G-proteins
of the Ras superfamily involved in signal transduction, AF reorga-
nization,
vesicle
fusion
and
other
processes.
Surprisingly,
Arabidopsis appears to lack genes for G-proteins of the Ras, Rho,
Rac and Cdc42 subfamilies but has many Rab-type G-proteins
involved in vesicle fusion and several Rop-type G-proteins, one of
which has a role in actin organization of the tip-growing pollen
tube78. The signi®cance of this divergent ampli®cation of different
subfamilies of small G-proteins in plants and animals remains to be
determined.
Arabidopsis possesses cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), includ-
ing a plant-speci®c Cdc2b kinase expressed in a cell-cycle-depen-
dent manner, several cyclin subtypes, including a D-type cyclin that

mediates cytokinin-stimulated cell-cycle progression79, a retinoblas-
toma-related protein and components of the ubiquitin-dependent
proteolytic pathway of cyclin degradation. In yeast and animal cells,
chromosome condensation is mediated by condensins, sister chro-
matids are held together by cohesins such as Scc1, and metaphase±
anaphase transition is triggered by separin/Esp1 endopeptidase
proteolysis of Scc1 on APC-mediated degradation of its inhibitor,
securin/Psd1. Related proteins are encoded by the Arabidopsis
genome. Thus, the basic machinery of cell-cycle progression,
genome duplication and segregation appears to be conserved in
plants. By contrast, entry into M phase, M-phase progression and
cytokinesis seem to be modi®ed in plant cells. Arabidopsis does not
appear to have homologues of Cdc25 phosphatase, which activates
Cdc2 kinase at the onset of mitosis, or of polo kinase, which
regulates M-phase progression in yeast and animals. Conversely,
plant-speci®c mitogen-actived protein (MAP) kinases appear to be
involved in cytokinesis.
Cytokinesis partitions the cytoplasm of the dividing cell. Yeast
and animal cells expand the membrane from the surface towards the
centre in a cleavage process supported by septins and a contractile
ring of actin and type II myosin. By contrast, plant cytokinesis starts
in the centre of the division plane and progresses laterally. A
transient membrane compartment, the cell plate, is formed de
novo by fusion of Golgi-derived vesicles traf®cking along the
phragmoplast MTs80. Consistent with the unique mode of plant
cytokinesis, Arabidopsis appears to lack genes for septins and type II
myosin. Conversely, cell-plate formation requires a cytokinesis-
speci®c syntaxin that has no close homologue in yeast and animals.
Although syntaxin-mediated membrane fusion occurs in animal
cytokinesis and cellularization, the vesicles are delivered to the base
of the cleavage furrow. Thus, the plant-speci®c mechanism of cell
division is linked to conserved eukaryotic cell-cycle machinery.
Two main conclusions are suggested by this comparative analysis.
First, Arabidopsis and eukaryotic cells have common features related
to intracellular activities, such as vesicle traf®cking, cytoskeleton
and cell cycle. Second, evolutionarily divergent features, such as
organization of the cytoskeleton and cytokinesis, appear to relate to
the plant cell wall.
Development
The regulation of development in Arabidopsis, as in animals,
involves cell±cell communication, hierarchies of transcription fac-
tors, and the regulation of chromatin state; however, there is no
reason to suppose that the complex multicellular states of plant and
animal development have evolved by elaborating the same general
processes during the 1.6 billion years since the last common uni-
cellular ancestor of plants and animals81,82. Our genome analyses
re¯ect the long, independent evolution of many processes contri-
buting to development in the two kingdoms.
Plants and animals have converged on similar processes of pattern
formation, but have used and expanded different transcription
factor families as key causal regulators. For example, segmentation
in insects and differentiation along the anterior±posterior and limb
axes in mammals both involve the spatially speci®c activation of a
series of homeobox gene family members. The pattern of activation
is causal in the later differentiation of body and limb axis regions. In
plants the pattern of ¯oral whorls (sepals, petals, stamens, carpels) is
also established by the spatially speci®c activation of members of a
family of transcription factors, but in this instance the family is the
MADS box family. Plants also have homeobox genes and animals
have MADS box genes, implying that each lineage invented sepa-
rately its mechanism of spatial pattern formation, while converging
on actions and interactions of transcription factors as the mechan-
ism. Other examples show even greater divergence of plant and
animal developmental control. Examples are the AP2/EREBP and
NAC families of transcription factors, which have important roles in
¯ower and meristem development; both families are so far found
only in plants (Supplementary Information Table 6).
A similar story can be told for cell±cell communication. Plants do
not seem to have receptor tyrosine kinases, but the Arabidopsis
genome has at least 340 genes for receptor Ser/Thr kinases, belong-
ing to many different families, de®ned by their putative extracellular
domains (Supplementary Information Table 7). Several families
have members with known functions in cell±cell communication,
such as the CLV1 receptor involved in meristem cell signalling, the
S-glycoprotein homologues involved in signalling from pollen to
stigma in self-incompatible Brassica species, and the BRI1 receptor
necessary for brassinosteroid signalling83. Animals also have recep-
tor Ser/Thr kinases, such as the transforming growth factor-b
(TGF-b) receptors, but these act through SMAD proteins that are
absent from Arabidopsis. The leucine-rich repeat (LRR) family of
Arabidopsis receptor kinases shares its extracellular domain with
many animal and fungal proteins that do not have associated kinase
domains, and there are at least 122 Arabidopsis genes that code for
LRR proteins without a kinase domain. Other Arabidopsis receptor
kinase families have extracellular domains that are unfamiliar in
animals. Thus, evolution is modular, and the plant and animal
lineages have expanded different families of receptor kinases for a
similar set of developmental processes.
Several Arabidopsis genes of developmental importance appear to
be derived from a cyanobacteria-like genome (Supplementary
Information Table 2), with no close relationship to any animal or
fungal protein. One salient example is the family of ethylene
receptors; another gene family of apparent chloroplast origin is
the phytochromesÐlight receptors involved in many developmen-
tal decisions (see below). Whereas the land plant phytochromes
show clear homology to the cyanobacterial light receptors, which
are typical prokaryotic histidine kinases, the plant phytochromes
are histidine kinase paralogues with Ser/Thr speci®city84. Similarly
to the ethylene receptors, the proteins that act downstream of plant
phytochrome signalling are not found in cyanobacteria, and thus it
appears that a bacterial light receptor entered the plant genome
through horizontal transfer, altered its enzymatic activity, and
became linked to a eukaryotic signal transduction pathway. This
infusion of genes from a cyanobacterial endosymbiont shows that
plants have a richer heritage of ancestral genes than animals, and
unique developmental processes that derive from horizontal gene
transfer.
Signal transduction
Being generally sessile organisms, plants have to respond to local
environmental conditions by changing their physiology or redirect-
ing their growth. Signals from the environment include light and
pathogen attack, temperature, water, nutrients, touch and gravity.
In addition to local cellular responses, some stimuli are commu-
nicated across the plant body, with plant hormones and peptides
acting as secondary messengers. Some hormones, such as auxin, are
taken up into the cell, whereas others, such as ethylene and
brassinosteroids, and the peptide CLV3, act as ligands for receptor
kinases on the plasma membrane. No matter where the signal is
perceived by the cell, it is transduced to the nucleus, resulting in
altered patterns of gene expression.
Comparative genome analysis between Arabidopsis, C. elegans
and Drosophila supports the idea that plants have evolved their own
pathways of signal transduction85. None of the components of the
widely adopted signalling pathways found in vertebrates, ¯ies or
worms, such as Wingless/Wnt, Hedgehog, Notch/lin12, JAK/STAT,
TGF-b/SMADs, receptor tyrosine kinase/Ras or the nuclear steroid
hormone receptors, is found in Arabidopsis. By contrast, brassinos-
teroids are ligands of the BRI1 Ser/Thr kinase, a member of the
largest recognizable class of transmembrane sensors encoded by
340 receptor-like kinase (RLK) genes in the Arabidopsis genome
(Supplementary Information Table 7). With a few notable excep-
tions, such as CLV1, the types of ligands sensed by RLKs are

completely unknown, providing an enormous future challenge for
plant biologists. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)/ seven-
transmembrane proteins are an abundant class of proteins in
mammalian genomes, instrumental in signal transduction. INTER-
PRO detected 27 GPCR-related domains in Arabidopsis (Supple-
mentary Information Table 1), although there is no direct
experimental evidence for these. Arabidopsis contains a family of
18 seven-transmembrane proteins of the mildew resistance (MlO)
class, several of which are involved in defence responses. Notably,
only single Ga (GPA1) and Gb (AGB1) subunits are found in
Arabidopsis, both previously known86.
Although cyclic GMP has been proposed to be involved in signal
transduction in Arabidopsis87, a protein containing a guanylate
cyclase domain was not identi®ed in our analyses. Nevertheless,
cyclic nucleotide-binding domains were detected in various pro-
teins, indicating that cNMPs may have a role in plant signal
transduction. Thus, although cNMP-binding domains appear to
have been conserved during evolution, cNMP synthesis in
Arabidopsis may have evolved independently.
We were unable to identify a protein with signi®cant similarity to
known Gg subunits, but recent biochemical studies suggest that a
protein with this functional capacity is likely to be present in plant
cells (H. Ma, personal communication). Therefore, there is poten-
tial for the formation of only a single heterotrimeric G-protein
complex; however, its functional interaction with any of the poten-
tial GPCR-related proteins remains to be determined.
Modules of cellular signal pathways from bacteria and animals
have been combined and new cascades have been innovated in
plants. A pertinent example is the response to the gaseous plant
hormone ethylene88. Ethylene is perceived and its signal transmitted
by a family of receptors related to bacterial-type two-component
histidine kinases (HKs). In bacteria, yeast and plants, these proteins
sense many extracellular signals and function in a His-to-Asp
phosphorelay network89. In turn, these proteins physically interact
with the genetically downstream protein CTR1, a Raf/MAPKKK-
related kinase, revealing the juxtaposition of bacterial-type two-
component receptors and animal-type MAP kinase cascades. Unlike
animals, however, Arabidopsis does not seem to have a Ras protein
to activate the MAP kinase cascade. MAP kinases are found in
abundance in Arabidopsis: we identi®ed ,20, a higher number than
in any other eukaryote. As potentially counteracting components,
we found ,70 putative PP2C protein phosphatases. Although this
group is largely uncharacterized functionally, several members are
related to ABI1/ABI2, key negative regulators in the signalling
pathway for the plant hormone abscisic acid. Additional compo-
nents of the His-to-Asp phosphorelay system were also found in
Arabidopsis, including authentic response regulators (ARRs), pseu-
doresponse regulators (PRRs) and phosphotransfer intermediate
protein (HPt)90. We found 11 HKs in the proteome (3 new), 16 RRs
(2 new) and 8 PRRs (2 new). The biological roles of most ARRs,
PRRs and HPts are largly unknown, but several have been found
to have diverse functions in plants, including transcriptional activa-
tion in response to the plant hormone cytokinin91, and as compo-
nents of the circadian clock92.
Plants seem to have evolved unique signalling pathways by
combining a conserved MAP kinase cascade module with new
receptor types. In many cases, however, the ligands are unknown.
Conversely, some known signalling molecules, such as auxin, are
still in search of a receptor. Auxin signalling may represent yet
another plant-speci®c mode of signalling, with protein degradation
through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway preceding altered gene
expression. With many Arabidopsis genes encoding components of
the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, elimination of negative regula-
tors may be a more widespread phenomenon in plant signalling.
Recognizing and responding to pathogens
Plants are constantly exposed to pests, parasites and pathogens and
have evolved many defences. In mammals, polymorphism for
parasite recognition encoded in the MHC genes contributes to
resistance. In plants, disease resistance (R) genes that confer parasite
recognition are also extremely polymorphic. This polymorphism
has been proposed to restrict parasites, and its absence may explain
the breakdown of resistance in crop monocultures93. In contrast to
MHC genes, plant resistance genes are found at several loci, and the
complete genome sequence enables analysis of their complement
and structure. Parasite recognition by resistance genes triggers
defence mechanisms through various signalling molecules, such as
protein kinases and adapter proteins, ion ¯uxes, reactive oxygen
intermediates and nitric oxide. These halt pathogen colonization
through transcriptional activation of defence genes and a form of
programmed cell death called the hypersensitive response94. The
Arabidopsis genome contains diverse resistance genes distributed at
many loci, along with components of signalling pathways, and
many other genes whose role in disease resistance has been inferred
from mutant phenotypes.
Most resistance genes encode intracellular proteins with a nucleo-
tide-binding (NB) site typical of small G proteins, and carboxy-
terminal LRRs95. Their amino termini either carry a TIR domain, or
a putative coiled coil (CC). There are 85 TIR±NB±LRR resistance
genes at 64 loci, and 36 CC±NB±LRR resistance genes at 30 loci.
Some NB±LRR resistance genes express neither obvious TIR nor
CC domains at their N termini. This potential class is present seven
times, at six loci. There are 15 truncated TIR±NB genes that lack an
LRR at 10 loci, often adjacent to full TIR±NB±LRR genes. There are
also six CC±NB genes, at ®ve loci. These truncated products may
function in resistance. Intriguingly, two TIR±NB±LRR genes carry
a WRKYdomain, found in transcription factors that are implicated
in plant defence, and one of these also encodes a protein kinase
domain.
Resistance gene evolution may involve duplication and diver-
gence of linked gene families36; however, most (46) resistance genes
are singletons; 50 are in pairs, 21 are in 7 clusters of 3 family
members, with single clusters of 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9 members,
respectively. Of the non-singletons, ,60% of pairs are in direct
repeats, and ,40% are in inverted repeats. Resistance genes are
unevenly distributed between chromosomes, with 49 on chromo-
some 1; 2 on chromosome 2; 16 on chromosome 3; 28 on chromo-
some 4; and 55 on chromosome 5.
In other plant species, resistance genes encode both transmem-
brane receptors for secreted pathogen products and protein kinases,
and some other classes are also found. The Cf genes in tomato
encode extracellular LRRs with a transmembrane domain and short
cytoplasmic domain. Mutation in an Arabidopsis homologue,
CLAVATA2, results in enlarged meristems, but to date no resistance
function has been assigned to the 30 Arabidopsis CLV2 homologues.
CLAVATA1, a transmembrane LRR kinase, is also required for
meristem function. Xa21, a rice LRR-kinase, confers Xanthomonas
resistance, and the Arabidopsis FLS2 LRR kinase confers recognition
of ¯agellin. It has been proposed that CLV1 and CLV2 function as a
heterodimer; perhaps this is also true for Xa21, FLS2 and Cf
proteins.
There
are
174
LRR
transmembrane
kinases
in
Arabidopsis, with only FLS2 assigned a role in resistance. A unique
resistance gene, beet Hs1pro-1, which confers nematode resistance,
has two Arabidopsis homologues.
The tomato Pto Ser/Thr kinase acts as a resistance protein in
conjunction with an NB±LRR protein, so similar kinases might do
the same for Arabidopsis NB±LRR proteins. There are 860 Ser/Thr
kinases in the Arabidopsis sequence. Fifteen of these share 50%
identity over the Pto-aligned region. The Toll pathway in Drosophila
and mammals regulates innate immune responses through
LRR/TIR domain receptors that recognize bacterial lipopo-
lysaccharides96. Pto is highly homologous to Drosophila PELLE
and mammalian IRAK protein kinases that mediate the TIR
pathway.

Additional genes have been de®ned that are required for resis-
tance by our analysis of the genome sequence. The ndr1 mutation
de®nes a gene required by the CC±NB±LRR gene RPS2 and RPM1.
NDR1 is 1 of 28 Arabidopsis genes that are similar both to each other
and to the tobacco HIN1 gene that is transcriptionally induced early
during the hypersensitive response. EDS1 is a gene required for
TIR±NB±LRR function, and like PAD4, encodes a protein with a
putative lipase motif. EDS1, PAD4 and a third gene comprise the
EDS1/PAD4 family. The NPR1/NIM1/SAI1 gene is required for
systemic acquired resistance, and we found ®ve additional NPR1
homologues. Recessive mutations at both the barley Mlo and
Arabidopsis LSD1 loci confer broad-spectrum resistance and dere-
press a cell-death program. There are at least 18 Mlo family
members that resemble heterotrimeric GPCRs in Arabidopsis, and
only two LSD1 homologues.
One of the earliest responses to pathogen recognition is the
production of reactive oxygen intermediates. This involves a spe-
cialized respiratory burst oxidase protein that transfers an electron
across the plasma membrane to make superoxide. Arabidopsis
encodes eight apparently functional gp91 homologues, called
Atrboh genes. Unlike gp91, they all carry an ,300 amino-acid N-
terminal extension carrying an EF-hand Ca2+-binding domain. In
mammals, activation of the respiratory oxidative burst complex in
the neutrophil, which includes gp91, requires the action of Rac
proteins. As no Rac or Ras proteins are found in Arabidopsis,
members of the large rop family of G proteins may carry this out.
Similarly, we did not detect any Arabidopsis homologues of other
mammalian respiratory burst oxidase components (p22, p47, p67,
p40).
There are no clear homologues of many mammalian defence and
cell-death control genes. Although nitric oxide production is
involved in plant defence, there is no obvious homologue of nitric
oxide synthase. Also absent are apparent homologues of the REL
domain transcription factors involved in innate immunity in both
Drosophila and mammals. We found no similarity to proteins
involved in regulating apoptosis in animal cells, such as classical
caspases, bcl2/ced9 and baculovirus p35. There are, however, 36
cysteine proteases. There are also eight homologues of a newly
de®ned metacaspase family97, two of which, along with LSD1, have a
clear GATA-type zinc-®nger.
Photomorphogenesis and photosynthesis
Because nearly all plants are sessile and most depend on photo-
synthesis, they have evolved unique ways of responding to light.
Light serves as an energy source, as well as a trigger and modulator
of complex developmental pathways, including those regulated by
the circadian clock. Light is especially important during seedling
emergence, where it stimulates chlorophyll production, leaf devel-
opment, cotyledon expansion, chloroplast biogenesis and the coor-
dinated induction of many nuclear- and chloroplast-encoded genes,
while at the same time inhibiting stem growth. The goal of this
process, called photomorphogenesis, is the establishment of a body
plan that allows the plant to be an ef®cient photosynthetic machine
under varying light conditions98. The signal transduction cascade
leading to light-induced responses begins with the activation of
photoreceptors. Next, the light signal is transduced via positively
and negatively acting nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins, causing
activation or derepression of nuclear and chloroplast-encoded
photosynthetic genes and enabling the plant to establish optimal
photoautotrophic growth. Although genetic and biochemical stud-
ies have de®ned many of the components in this process, the
genome sequence provides an opportunity to identify comprehen-
sively Arabidopsis genes involved in photomorphogenesis and the
establishment of photoautotrophic growth. We identi®ed at least
100 candidate genes involved in light perception and signalling, and
139 nuclear-encoded genes that potentially function in photosynth-
esis.
The roles have been described of only 35 of the 100 candidate
photomorphogenic genes (Supplementary Information Table 8).
All of the light photoreceptors had been discovered previously,
including ®ve red/far-red absorbing phytochromes (PHYA-E), two
blue/ultraviolet-A absorbing cryptochromes (CRY1 and CRY2),
one blue-absorbing phototropin (NPH1) and one NPH1-like (or
NPL1). In contrast, we uncovered many new proteins similar to
the photomorphogenesis regulators COP/DET/FUS, PKS1, PIF3,
NDPK2, SPA1, FAR1, GIGANTEA, FIN219, HY5, CCA1, ATHB-2,
ZEITLUPE, FKF1, LKP1, NPH3 and RPT2.
Both the phytochromes and NPH1 contain chromophores for
light sensing coupled to kinase domains for signal transmission.
Phytochromes have an N-terminal chromophore-binding domain,
two PAS domains, and a C-terminal Ser/Thr kinase domain99,
whereas NPH1 has two LOV domains (members of the PAS
domain superfamily) for ¯avin mononucleotide binding and a
C-terminal Ser/Thr kinase domain100. PAS domains potentially
sense changes in light, redox potential and oxygen energy levels, as
well as mediating protein±protein interactions99,100. We searched
for uncharacterized proteins with the combination of a kinase
domain and either a phytochrome chromophore-binding site or
PAS domains. Although we found no new phytochrome-like
genes, we did identify four predicted proteins that contain PAS
and kinase domains (Supplementary Information Fig. 6). These
proteins share 80% amino-acid identity, but, unlike NPH1 and
NPL1, have only one PAS domain. The combination of potential
signal sensing and transmitting domains makes it tempting to
speculate that these proteins may be receptors for light or other
signals.
Our screen included searches for components of photosynthetic
reaction centres and light-harvesting complexes, enzymes involved
in CO2 ®xation and enzymes in pigment biosynthesis. We identi®ed
11 core proteins of photosystem I, including the eukaryotic-speci®c
components PsaG and PsaH101, and 8 photosystem II proteins,
including a single member (psbW) of the photosystem II core. We
also found 26 proteins similar to the Chlorophyll-a/b binding
proteins (8 Lhca and 18 Lhcb). Of the seven subunits of the
cytochrome b6f complex (PetA±D, PetG, PetL, PetM), only one
(PetC) was found in the nuclear genome, whereas the remainder are
probably encoded in the chloroplast. Similarly, of the nine subunits
of the chloroplast ATP synthase complex, three are encoded in the
nucleus, including the II- , g- and d-subunits; the remaining
subunits (I, III, IV, a, b, e) are encoded in the chloroplast102. Ten
genes were related to the soluble components of the electron transfer
chain, including two plastocyanins, ®ve ferredoxins and three
ferredoxin/NADP oxidoreductases. Forty genes are predicted to
have a role in CO2 ®xation, including all of the enzymes in the
Calvin±Benson cycle. For pigment biosynthesis, 16 genes in chlor-
ophyll biosynthesis and 31 genes in carotenoid biosynthesis were
found (Supplementary Information Table 8). Our analyses have
identi®ed several potential components of the light perception
pathway, and have revealed the complex distribution of components
of the photosynthetic apparatus between nuclear and plastid
genomes.
Metabolism
Arabidopsis is an autotrophic organism that needs only minerals,
light, water and air to grow. Consequently, a large proportion of the
genome encodes enzymes that support metabolic processes, such as
photosynthesis, respiration, intermediary metabolism, mineral
acquisition, and the synthesis of lipids, fatty acids, amino acids,
nucleotides and cofactors103. With respect to these processes,
Arabidopsis appears to contain a complement of genes similar to
those in the photoautotropic cyanobacterium Synechocystis45, but,
whereas Synechocystis generally has a single gene encoding an enzyme,
Arabidopsis frequently has many. For example, Arabidopsis has at
least seven genes for the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase, with an

additional ®ve for pyruvate kinase-like proteins. Whatever the
reason for this high level of redundancy, it varies from gene to
gene in the same pathway; the 11 enzymes of glycolysis are encoded
by up to 51 genes that are present in as few as one or as many as eight
copies. Similarly, of the 59 genes encoding proteins involved in
glycerolipid metabolism, 39 are represented by more than one
gene104. Genome duplication and expansion of gene families by
tandem duplication have contributed to this diversity.
This high degree of apparent structural redundancy does not
necessarily imply functional redundancy. For instance, although
there are seven genes for serine hydroxymethyltransferase, a muta-
tion in the gene for the mitochondrial form completely blocks the
photorespiratory pathway105. Although there are 12 genes for
cellulose synthase, mutations in at least 2 of the 12 confer distinct
phenotypes because of tissue-speci®c gene expression106.
The metabolome of Arabidopsis differs from that of cyanobac-
teria, or of any other organism sequenced to date, by the presence of
many genes encoding enzymes for pathways that are unique to
vascular plants. In particular, although relatively little is known
about the enzymology of cell-wall metabolism, more than 420 genes
could be assigned probable roles in pathways responsible for the
synthesis and modi®cation of cell-wall polymers. Twelve genes
encode cellulose synthase, and 29 other genes encode 6 families of
structurally related enzymes thought to synthesize other major
polysaccharides106. Roughly 52 genes encode polygalacturonases,
20 encode pectate lyases and 79 encode pectin esterases, indicating a
massive investment in modifying pectin. Similarly, the presence of
39 b-1,3-glucanases, 20 endoxyloglucan transglycosylases, 50 cellu-
lases and other hydrolases, and 23 expansins re¯ects the importance
of wall remodelling during growth of plant cells. Excluding ascor-
bate and glutathione peroxidases, there are 69 genes with signi®cant
similarity to known peroxidases and 15 laccases (diphenol oxi-
dases). Their presence in such abundance indicates the importance
of oxidative processes in the synthesis of lignin, suberin and other
cell-wall polymers. The high degree of apparent redundancy in the
genes for cell-wall metabolism might re¯ect differences in substrate
speci®city by some of the enzymes.
The high degree of apparent redundancy in the genes for cell wall
metabolism might re¯ect differences in substrate speci®city by some
of the enzymes. It is already known that cell types have different wall
compositions, which may require that the relevant enzymes be
subject to cell-type-speci®c transcriptional regulation. Of the 40 or
so cell types that plants make, almost all can be identi®ed by unique
features of their cell wall107. A large number of genes involved in wall
metabolism have yet to be de®ned. Although more than 60 genes for
glycosyltransferases can be found in the genome sequence, most of
these are probably involved in protein glycosylation or metabolite
catabolism and do not seem to be adequate to account for the
polysaccharide complexity of the wall. For instance, at least 21
enzymes are required just to produce the linkages of the pectic
polysaccharide RGII, and none of these enzymes has been identi®ed
at present. Thus, if these and related enzymes involved in the
synthesis of other cell-wall polymers are also represented by multi-
ple genes, a substantial number of the genes of currently unknown
function may be involved in cell-wall metabolism.
Higher plants collectively synthesize more than 100,000 second-
ary metabolites. Because ¯owering plants are thought to have
similar numbers of genes, it is apparent that a great deal of
enzyme creation took place during the evolution of higher plants.
An important factor in the rapid evolution of metabolic complexity
is the large family of cytochrome P450s that are evident in
Arabidopsis (Supplementary Information Table 1). These enzymes
represent a superfamily of haem-containing proteins, most of which
catalyse NADPH- and O2-dependent hydroxylation reactions. Plant
P450s participate in myriad biochemical pathways including those
devoted to the synthesis of plant products, such as phenylpropa-
noids, alkaloids, terpenoids, lipids, cyanogenic glycosides and
glucosinolates, and plant growth regulators, such as gibberellins,
jasmonic acid and brassinosteroids. Whereas Arabidopsis has ,286
P450 genes, Drosophila has 94, C. elegans has 73 and yeast has only 3.
This low number in yeast indicates that there are few reactions of
basic metabolism that are catalysed by P450s. It seems likely that
many animal P450s are involved in detoxi®cation of compounds
from food plant sources. The role of endogenous enzymes is poorly
understood; only a few dozen P450 enzymes from plants have been
characterized to any extent. The discrepancy between the number of
known P450-catalysed reactions and the number of genes suggests
that Arabidopsis produces a relatively large number of metabolites
that have yet to be identi®ed.
In addition to the large number of cytochrome P450s, Arabidopsis
has many other genes that suggest the existence of pathways or
processes that are not currently known. For instance, the presence of
19 genes with similarity to anthranilate N-hydroxycinnamoyl/
benzoyl transferase is currently inexplicable. This enzyme is
involved in the synthesis of dianthramide phytoalexins in Caryo-
phyllaceae and Gramineae. No phytoalexins of this class have been
described in Arabidopsis as yet. Similarly, the presence of 12 genes
with sequence similarity to the berberine bridge enzyme, ((S)-
reticuline:oxygen oxidoreductase (methylene-bridge-forming); EC
1.5.3.9), and 13 genes with similarity to tropinone reductase,
suggests that Arabidopsis may have the ability to produce alkaloids.
In other plants, the berberine bridge enzyme transforms reticuline
into scoulerine, a biosynthetic precursor to a multitude of species-
speci®c protopine, protoberberine and benzophenanthridine alka-
loids. The discovery of these and many other intriguing genes in
the Arabidopsis genome has created a wealth of new opportunities
to understand the metabolic and structural diversity of higher
plants.
Concluding remarks
The twentieth century began with the rediscovery of Mendel's rules
of inheritance in pea108, and it ends with the elucidation of the
complete genetic complement of a model plant, Arabidopsis. The
analysis of the completed sequence of a ¯owering plant reported
here provides insights into the genetic basis of the similarities and
differences of diverse multicellular organisms. It also creates the
potential for direct and ef®cient access to a much deeper under-
standing of plant development and environmental responses, and
permits the structure and dynamics of plant genomes to be assessed
and understood.
Arabidopsis, C. elegans and Drosophila have a similar range of
11,000±15,000 different types of proteins, suggesting this is the
minimal complexity required by extremely diverse multicellular
eukaryotes to execute development and respond to their environ-
ment. We account for the larger number of gene copies in
Arabidopsis compared with these other sequenced eukaryotes with
two possible explanations. First, independent ampli®cation of
individual genes has generated tandem and dispersed gene families
to a greater extent in Arabidopsis, and unequal crossing over may be
the predominant mechanism involved. Second, ancestral duplica-
tion of the entire genome and subsequent rearrangements have
resulted in segmental duplications. The pattern of these duplica-
tions suggests an ancient polyploidy event, and mutant analysis
indicates that at least some of the many duplicate genes are
functionally redundant. Their occurrence in a functionally diploid
genetic model came as a surprise, and is reminiscent of the situation
in maize, an ancient segmental allotetraploid. The remarkable
degree of genome plasticity revealed in the large-scale duplications
may be needed to provide new functions, as alternative promoters
and alternative splicing appear to be less widely used in plants than
they are in animals. Apart from duplicated segments, the overall
chromosome structure of Arabidopsis closely resembles that of
Drosophila; transposons and other repetitive sequences are concen-
trated in the heterochromatic regions surrounding the centromere,

whereas the euchromatic arms are largely devoid of repetitive
sequences. Conversely, most protein-coding genes reside in the
euchromatin, although a number of expressed genes have been
identi®ed in centromeric regions. Finally, Arabidopsis is the ®rst
methylated eukaryotic genome to be sequenced, and will be invalu-
able in the study of epigenetic inheritance and gene regulation.
Unlike most animals, plants generally do not move, they can
perpetuate inde®nitely, they reproduce through an extended hap-
loid phase, and they synthesize all their metabolites. Our compar-
ison of Arabidopsis, bacterial, fungal and animal genomes starts to
de®ne the genetic basis for these differences between plants and
other life forms. Basic intracellular processes, such as translation or
vesicle traf®cking, appear to be conserved across kingdoms, re¯ect-
ing a common eukaryotic heritage. More elaborate intercellular
processes, including physiology and development, use different sets
of components. For example, membrane channels, transporters and
signalling components are very different in plants and animals, and
the large number of transcription factors unique to plants contrasts
with the conservation of many chromatin proteins across the three
eukaryotic kingdoms. Unexpected differences between seemingly
similar processes include the absence of intracellular regulators of
cell division (Cdc25) and apoptosis (Bcl-2). On the other hand,
DNA repair appears more highly conserved between plants and
mammals than within the animal kingdom, perhaps re¯ecting
common factors such as DNA methylation. Our analysis also
shows that many genes of the endosymbiotic ancestor of the plastid
have been transferred to the nucleus, and the products of this rich
prokaryotic heritage contribute to diverse functions such as photo-
autotrophic growth and signalling.
The sequence reported here changes the fundamental nature of
plant genetic analysis. Forward genetics is greatly simpli®ed as
mutations are more conveniently isolated molecularly, but at the
same time extensive gene duplications mean that functional redun-
dancy must be taken into account. At a biochemical level, the
speci®city conferred by nucleotide sequence, and the completeness
of the survey allow complex mixtures of RNA and protein to be
resolved into their individual components using micro-arrays and
mass spectrometry. This speci®city can also be used in the parallel
analysis of genome-wide polymorphisms and quantitative traits in
natural populations109. Looking ahead, the challenge of determining
the function of the large set of predicted genes, many of which are
plant-speci®c, is now a clear priority, and multinational programs
have been initiated to accomplish this goal using site-selected
mutagenesis among the the necessary tools110. Finally, productive
paths of crop improvement, based on enhanced knowledge of
Arabidopsis gene function, will help meet the challenge of sustaining
our food supply in the coming years.
Note added in proof: at the time of publication 17 centromeric BACs
and 5 sequence gaps in chromosome arms are being sequenced. M
Methods
The three centres used similar annotation approaches involving in silico gene-®nding
methods, comparison to EST and protein databases, and manual reconciliation of that
data. Gene ®nding involved three steps: (1) analysis of BAC sequences using a computa-
tional gene ®nder; (2) alignment of the sequence to the protein and EST databases; (3)
assignment of functions to each of the genes. Genscan111, GeneMark.HMM112, Xgrail113
Gene®nder (P. Green, unpublished software) and GlimmerA114 were used to analyse BAC
sequences. All of these systems were specially trained for Arabidopsis genes. Splice sites
were predicted using NetGene2115, Splice Predictor116 and GeneSplicer (M. Pertea and
S. Salzberg, unpublished software). For the second step, BACs were aligned to ESTs and to
the Arabidopsis gene index117 using programs such as DDS/GAP2118 or BLASTN119.
Segmental duplications were analysed and displayed using a modi®ed version of
DIALIGN2 (ref. 120).
