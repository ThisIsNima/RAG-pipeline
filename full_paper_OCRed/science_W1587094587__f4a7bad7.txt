Preface
Mixed-eﬀects models provide a ﬂexible and powerful tool for the analysis of
grouped data, which arise in many areas as diverse as agriculture, biology,
economics, manufacturing, and geophysics. Examples of grouped data in-
clude longitudinal data, repeated measures, blocked designs, and multilevel
data. The increasing popularity of mixed-eﬀects models is explained by the
ﬂexibility they oﬀer in modeling the within-group correlation often present
in grouped data, by the handling of balanced and unbalanced data in a
uniﬁed framework, and by the availability of reliable and eﬃcient software
for ﬁtting them.
This book provides an overview of the theory and application of lin-
ear and nonlinear mixed-eﬀects models in the analysis of grouped data.
A uniﬁed model-building strategy for both linear and nonlinear models is
presented and applied to the analysis of over 20 real datasets from a wide va-
riety of areas, including pharmacokinetics, agriculture, and manufacturing.
A strong emphasis is placed on the use of graphical displays at the various
phases of the model-building process, starting with exploratory plots of the
data and concluding with diagnostic plots to assess the adequacy of a ﬁtted
model. Over 170 ﬁgures are included in the book.
The class of mixed-eﬀects models considered in this book assumes that
both the random eﬀects and the errors follow Gaussian distributions. These
models are intended for grouped data in which the response variable is (at
least approximately) continuous. This covers a large number of practical
applications of mixed-eﬀects models, but does not include, for example,
generalized linear mixed-eﬀects models (Diggle, Liang and Zeger, 1994).

Preface
The balanced mix of real data examples, modeling software, and theory
makes this book a useful reference for practitioners who use, or intend to
use, mixed-eﬀects models in their data analyses. It can also be used as a text
for a one-semester graduate-level applied course in mixed-eﬀects models.
Researchers in statistical computing will also ﬁnd this book appealing for
its presentation of novel and eﬃcient computational methods for ﬁtting
linear and nonlinear mixed-eﬀects models.
The nlme library we developed for analyzing mixed-eﬀects models in im-
plementations of the S language, including S-PLUS and R, provides the
underlying software for implementing the methods presented in the text,
being described and illustrated in detail throughout the book. All analyses
included in the book were produced using version 3.1 of nlme with S-PLUS
3.4 running on an Iris 5.4 Unix platform. Because of platform dependen-
cies, the analysis results may be expected to vary slightly with diﬀerent
computers or operating systems and with diﬀerent implementations of S.
Furthermore, the current version of the nlme library for R does not support
the same range of graphics presentations as does the S-PLUS version. The
latest version of nlme and further information on the NLME project can
be obtained at
http://nlme.stat.wisc.edu or
http://cm.bell-labs.com/stat/NLME.
Errata and updates of the material in the book will be made available
on-line at the same sites.
The book is divided into parts. Part I, comprising ﬁve chapters, is ded-
icated to the linear mixed-eﬀects (LME) model and Part II, comprising
three chapters, covers the nonlinear mixed-eﬀects (NLME) model. Chap-
ter 1 gives an overview of LME models, introducing some examples of
grouped data and the type of analyses that applies to them. The theory
and computational methods for LME models are the topics of Chapter
2. Chapter 3 describes the structure of grouped data and the many fa-
cilities available in the nlme library to display and summarize such data.
The model-building approach we propose is described and illustrated in
detail in the context of LME models in Chapter 4. Extensions of the ba-
sic LME model to include variance functions and correlation structures for
the within-group errors are considered in Chapter 5. The second part of
the book follows an organization similar to the ﬁrst. Chapter 6 provides
an overview of NLME models and some of the analysis tools available for
them in nlme. The theory and computational methods for NLME models
are described in Chapter 7. The ﬁnal chapter is dedicated to model building
in the context of NLME models and to illustrating in detail the nonlinear
modeling facilities available in the nlme library.
Even though the material covered in the book is, for the most part,
self-contained, we assume that the reader has some familiarity with linear
regression models, say at the level of Draper and Smith (1998). Although
enough theory is covered in the text to understand the strengths and weak-

nesses of mixed-eﬀects models, we emphasize the applied aspects of these.
Readers who desire to learn in more detail the theory of mixed-eﬀects
are referred to the excellent book by Davidian and Giltinan (1995). Some
knowledge of the S language is deﬁnitely desireable, but not a pre-requisite
for following the material in the book. For those who are new to, or less
familiar with S, we suggest using in conjunction with this book the, by now,
classic reference Venables and Ripley (1999), which provides an overview
of S and an introduction to a wide variety of statistical models to be used
with S.

and would appreciate being informed of typos, errors, and improvements
to the contents of this book.
Typographical Conventions:
The S language objects and commands referenced throughout the book are
printed in a monospaced typewriter font like this, while the S classes are
printed in sans-serif font like this. The standard prompt > is used for S
commands and the prompt + is used to indicate continuation lines.
To save space, some of the S output has been edited. Omission of com-
plete lines are usually indicated by
. . .
but some blank lines have been removed without indication. The S output
was generated using the options settings
> options( width = 68, digits = 5 )
The default settings are for 80 and 7, respectively.

This book would not exist without the help and encouragement of many

the people who have read and commented on earlier versions of the book;
their many useful suggestions have had a direct impact on the current
organization of the book. Our thanks also go to the many people who have
tested and made suggestions on the nlme library, in particular the beta
testers for the current version of the software. It would not be possible to
name all these people here, but in particular we would like to thank John
