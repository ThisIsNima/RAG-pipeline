Abstract
Background: Correlation networks are increasingly being used in bioinformatics applications. For
example, weighted gene co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for describing
the correlation patterns among genes across microarray samples. Weighted correlation network
analysis (WGCNA) can be used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes, for
summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an intramodular hub gene, for relating
modules to one another and to external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and
for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks facilitate network based gene
screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These
methods have been successfully applied in various biological contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics,
yeast genetics, and analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation network
methodology have been described in separate publications, there is a need to provide a user-
friendly, comprehensive, and consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial.
Results: The WGCNA R software package is a comprehensive collection of R functions for
performing various aspects of weighted correlation network analysis. The package includes
functions for network construction, module detection, gene selection, calculations of topological
properties, data simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external software. Along with the R
package we also present R software tutorials. While the methods development was motivated by
gene expression data, the underlying data mining approach can be applied to a variety of different
settings.
Conclusion: The WGCNA package provides R functions for weighted correlation network
analysis, e.g. co-expression network analysis of gene expression data. The R package along with its
source code and additional material are freely available at http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/labs/

Background
Correlation networks are increasingly being used in biol-
ogy to analyze large, high-dimensional data sets. Correla-
tion networks are constructed on the basis of correlations
between quantitative measurements that can be described
by an n × m matrix X = [xil] where the row indices corre-
spond to network nodes (i = 1, . . ., n) and the column
indices (l = 1, . . ., m) correspond to sample measure-

We refer to the i-th row xi as the i-th node profile across m
sample measurements.
Sometimes a quantitative measure (referred to as sample
trait) is provided for the columns of X. For example, T =
(T1, . . ., Tm) could measure survival time or it could be a
binary indicator variable (disease status). Abstractly
speaking, we define a sample trait T as a vector with m
components that correspond to the columns of the data
matrix X. A sample trait can be used to define a node sig-
nificance measure. For example, a trait-based node signifi-
cance measure can be defined as the absolute value of the
correlation between the i-th node profile xi and the sample
trait T:
GSi = |cor(xi, T)|.
(2)
Alternatively, a correlation test p-value [1] or a regression-
based p-value for assessing the statistical significance
between xi and the sample trait T can be used to define a
p-value based node significance measure, for example by
defining
GSi = -log pi.
(3)
The rationale behind correlation network methodology is
to use network language to describe the pairwise relation-
ships (correlations) between the rows of X (Equation 1).
Although other statistical techniques exist for analyzing
correlation matrices, network language is particularly
intuitive to biologists and allows for simple social net-
work analogies. Correlation networks can be used to
address many analysis goals including the following. First,
correlation networks can be used to find clusters (mod-
ules) of interconnected nodes. Thus, a network module is
a set of rows of X (Equation 1) which are closely con-
nected according to a suitably defined measure of inter-
connectedness.
A second analysis goal is to summarize the node profiles
of a given module by a representative, e.g. a highly con-
nected hub node, which is centrally located in the mod-
ule. Focusing the analysis on module or their
representatives amounts to a network-based data reduc-
tion method. Relating modules instead of nodes to a sam-
ple trait can alleviate the multiple testing problem.
A third analysis goal is to identify 'significant' modules.
Toward this end, a node significance measure can be used
to identify modules with high average node significance
(referred to as module significance).
A fourth analysis goal is to annotate all network nodes
with respect to how close they are to the identified mod-
ules. This can be accomplished by defining a fuzzy meas-
ure of module memberships that generalizes the binary
module membership indicator to a quantitative measure.
Fuzzy measures of module membership can be used to
identify nodes that lie intermediate between and close to
two or more modules.
A fifth analysis goal is to define the network neighbor-
hood of a given seed set of nodes. Intuitively speaking, a
neighborhood is composed of nodes that are highly con-
nected to a given set of nodes. Thus, neighborhood anal-
ysis facilitates a guilt-by-association screening strategy for
finding nodes that interact with a given set of interesting
nodes.
A sixth analysis goal is to screen for nodes based on node
screening criteria which can be based on a node signifi-
cance measure, on module membership information, on
network topological properties (e.g. high connectivity),
etc.
A seventh analysis goal is to contrast one network with
another network. This differential network analysis can be
used to identify changes in connectivity patterns or mod-
ule structure between different conditions. An eighth
analysis goal is to find shared modules between two or
more networks (consensus module analysis). Since by
definition consensus modules are building blocks in mul-
tiple networks, they may represent fundamental structural
properties of the network.
The above incomplete enumeration of analysis goals
shows that correlation networks can be used as a data
exploratory technique (similar to cluster analysis, factor
analysis, or other dimensional reduction techniques) and
as a screening method. For example, correlation networks
can be used to screen for modules and intramodular hubs
that relate to a sample trait. Correlation networks allow
one to generate testable hypotheses that should be vali-
dated in independent data or in designed validation
experiments.
Gene Co-Expression Networks
In the following, we focus on gene co-expression networks
which represent a major application of correlation net-
work methodology. Co-expression networks have been
found useful for describing the pairwise relationships
among gene transcripts [2-9]. In co-expression networks,

we refer to nodes as 'genes', to the node profile xi as the
gene expression profile, and to the node significance
measure GSi as the gene significance measure. A glossary
of important network-related terms can be found in Table
1. Here we introduce an R software package that summa-
rizes and extends our earlier work on weighted gene co-
expression 
network 
analysis 
(WGCNA) 
[5,10-12].
WGCNA has been used to analyze gene expression data
from brain cancer [10], yeast cell cycle [13], mouse genet-
ics [14-17], primate brain tissue [18-20], diabetes [21],
chronic fatigue patients [22] and plants [23]. While these
publications have made R software code available in vari-
ous forms, there is a need for a comprehensive R package
that summarizes and standardizes methods and func-
tions. To address this need, we introduce the WGCNA R
package which also includes enhanced and novel func-
tions for co-expression network analysis.
Results
Figure 1 provides an overview of typical analysis steps and
the rationale behind them. To determine whether a co-
expression module is biologically meaningful, one can
use functional enrichment and gene ontology informa-
tion.
Overview of functions included in the WGCNA package
The WGCNA package contains a comprehensive set of
functions for performing a correlation network analysis of
large, high-dimensional data sets. Functions in the
WGCNA package can be divided into the following cate-
gories: 1. network construction; 2. module detection; 3.
module and gene selection; 4. calculations of topological
properties; 5. data simulation; 6. visualization; 7. interfac-
ing with external software packages. An exhaustive list of
implemented functions together with detailed descrip-
tions is provided in the R package manual posted on our
web site. Here we briefly outline the main functionality of
the package and highlight new contributions.
Category 1: Functions for network construction
A network is fully specified by its adjacency matrix aij, a
symmetric n × n matrix with entries in [0, 1] whose com-
ponent aij encodes the network connection strength
between nodes i and j. To calculate the adjacency matrix,
an intermediate quantity called the co-expression similarity
sij is first defined. The default method defines the co-
expression similarity sij as the absolute value of the corre-
lation coefficient between the profiles of nodes i and j:
sij = |cor(xi, xj)|.
The WGCNA package also implements alternative co-
expression measures, e.g. more robust measures of corre-
lation (the biweight midcorrelation [24] or the Spearman
correlation). A signed co-expression measure can be
defined to keep track of the sign of the co-expression
information. For convenience, we define the co-expres-
sion similarity measure such that it takes on values in [0,
1].
Using a thresholding procedure, the co-expression simi-
larity is transformed into the adjacency. An unweighted
network adjacency aij between gene expression profiles xi
and xj can be defined by hard thresholding the co-expres-
sion similarity sij as
where W is the "hard" threshold parameter. Thus, two
genes are linked (aij = 1) if the absolute correlation
between their expression profiles exceeds the (hard)
threshold W. The hard-thresholding procedure is imple-
mented in the function signumAdjacencyFunction. While
unweighted networks are widely used, they do not reflect
the continuous nature of the underlying co-expression
information and may thus lead to an information loss. In
contrast, weighted networks allow the adjacency to take
on continuous values between 0 and 1. A weighed net-
work adjacency can be defined by raising the co-expres-
sion similarity to a power [5,10]:
with E t 1. The function adjacency calculates the adja-
cency matrix from expression data. The adjacency in Equa-
tion 5 implies that the weighted adjacency aij between two
genes is proportional to their similarity on a logarithmic
scale, log(aij) = E × log(sij). Adjacency functions for both
weighted and unweighted networks require the user to
choose threshold parameters, for example by applying the
approximate scale-free topology criterion [5]. The package
provides functions pickSoftThreshold, pickHardThresh-
old that assist in choosing the parameters, as well as the
function scaleFreePlot for evaluating whether the network
exhibits a scale free topology. Figure 2A shows a plot iden-
tifying scale free topology in simulated expression data.
Category 2: Functions for module detection
Once the network has been constructed, module detec-
tion is often a logical next step. Modules are defined as
clusters of densely interconnected genes. Several measures
of network interconnectedness are described in [25]. As
default, we we use the topological overlap measure [5,25-
27] since it has worked well in several applications.
WGCNA identifies gene modules using unsupervised clus-
tering, i.e. without the use of a priori defined gene sets.
The user has a choice of several module detection meth-
ods. The default method is hierarchical clustering using
the standard R function hclust [28]; branches of the hier-

Table 1: Glossary of WGCNA Terminology.
Term
Definition
Co-expression network
We define co-expression networks as undirected, weighted gene networks. 
The nodes of such a network correspond to gene expression profiles, and 
edges between genes are determined by the pairwise correlations between 
gene expressions. By raising the absolute value of the correlation to a power 
E t 1 (soft thresholding), the weighted gene co-expression network 
construction emphasizes high correlations at the expense of low 
correlations. Specifically, aij = |cor(xi, xj)|E represents the adjacency of an 
unsigned network. Optionally, the user can also specify a signed co-
expression network where the adjacency is defined as aij = |(1 + cor(xi, xj))/
2|E.
Module
Modules are clusters of highly interconnected genes. In an unsigned co-
expression network, modules correspond to clusters of genes with high 
absolute correlations. In a signed network, modules correspond to positively 
correlated genes.
Connectivity
For each gene, the connectivity (also known as degree) is defined as the sum 
of connection strengths with the other network genes: ki = ¦uziaui. In co-
expression networks, the connectivity measures how correlated a gene is 
with all other network genes.
Intramodular connectivity kIM
Intramodular connectivity measures how connected, or co-expressed, a 
given gene is with respect to the genes of a particular module. The 
intramodular connectivity may be interpreted as a measure of module 
membership.
Module eigengene E
The module eigengene E is defined as the first principal component of a given 
module. It can be considered a representative of the gene expression profiles 
in a module.
Eigengene significance
When a microarray sample trait y is available (e.g. case control status or body 
weight), one can correlate the module eigengenes with this outcome. The 
correlation coefficient is referred to as eigengene significance.
Module Membership, also known as eigengene-based connectivity kME
For each gene, we define a "fuzzy" measure of module membership by 
correlating its gene expression profile with the module eigengene of a given 
module. For example, MMblue(i) = 
 = cor(xi, Eblue) measures how 
correlated gene i is to the blue module eigengene. MMblue(i) measures the 
membership of the i-th gene with respect to the blue module. If MMblue(i) is 
close to 0, the i-th gene is not part of the blue module. On the other hand, if 
MMblue(i) is close to 1 or -1, it is highly connected to the blue module genes. 
The sign of module membership encodes whether the gene has a positive or 
a negative relationship with the blue module eigengene. The module 
membership measure can be defined for all input genes (irrespective of their 
original module membership). It turns out that the module membership 
measure is highly related to the intramodular connectivity kIM. Highly 
connected intramodular hub genes tend to have high module membership 
values to the respective module.
Hub gene
This loosely defined term is used as an abbreviation of "highly connected 
gene." By definition, genes inside co-expression modules tend to have high 
connectivity.
Gene significance GS
To incorporate external information into the co-expression network, we 
make use of gene significance measures. Abstractly speaking, the higher the 
absolute value of GSi, the more biologically significant is the i-th gene. For 
example, GSi could encode pathway membership (e.g. 1 if the gene is a known 
apoptosis gene and 0 otherwise), knockout essentiality, or the correlation 
with an external microarray sample trait. A gene significance measure could 
also be defined by minus log of a p-value. The only requirement is that gene 
significance of 0 indicates that the gene is not significant with regard to the 
biological question of interest. The gene significance can take on positive or 
negative values.
Module significance
Module significance is determined as the average absolute gene significance 
measure for all genes in a given module. When gene significance is defined as 
the correlation of gene expression profiles with an external trait y, this 
measure tends to be highly related to the correlation between the module 
eigengene and y.

archical clustering dendrogram correspond to modules
and can be identified using one of a number of available
branch cutting methods, for example the constant-height
cut or two Dynamic Branch Cut methods [29].
In Figure 2C we show a network heatmap plot (intercon-
nectivity plot) of a gene network together with the corre-
sponding hierarchical clustering dendrograms and the
resulting modules. Figure 2B provides an alternate visual-
ization of the module structure via a multi-dimensional
scaling plot (standard R function cmdscale).
One drawback of hierarchical clustering is that it can be
difficult to determine how many (if any) clusters are
present in the data set. Although the height and shape
parameters of the Dynamic Tree Cut method provide
improved exibility for branch cutting and module detec-
tion, it remains an open research question how to choose
optimal cutting parameters or how to estimate the
number of clusters in the data set [30]. While our default
parameter values have worked well in several applica-
tions, in practice we recommend to carry out a cluster sta-
bility/robustness analysis. A co-expression module may
reflect a true biological signal (e.g. a pathway) or it may
reflect noise (e.g. a technical artifacts, tissue contamina-
tion, or a false positive). To test whether the identified
modules are biologically meaningful, gene ontology
information (functional enrichment analysis) can be
used. Toward this end, we provide an R tutorial that
describes how to interface the WGCNA package with rele-
vant external software packages and databases.
Summarizing the profiles of a module
Several options have been implemented for summarizing
the gene expression profiles of a given module. For exam-
ple, the function moduleEigengenes represents the mod-
ule expressions of the q-th module by the module
eigengene E(q), defined as the first principal component of
the expression matrix. The eigengene E can be thought of
as a weighted average expression profile. Eigengene calcu-
lation incorporates imputation of missing values imple-
mented in the package impute [31,32]. Alternatively, the
user can use the intramodular connectivity measure to
define the most highly connected intramodular hub gene
as the module representative. One can show that
intramodular hub genes are highly correlated with the
module eigengene [11].
Fuzzy measure of module membership
Hierarchical clustering and most other standard clustering
methods such as Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM)
[28] result in a binary module assignment, i.e. a node is
either in or outside of a module. In some applications it
may be advantageous to define a continuous, fuzzy meas-
ure of module membership for all nodes. Such measure is
particularly useful to identify nodes that lie near the
boundary of a module, or nodes that are intermediate
between two or more modules. As explained in detail in
[11], the module membership of node i in module q can
be defined as
where xi is the profile of node i and E(q) is the module
eigengene of module q. The module membership measure
 lies in [-1, 1] and specifies how close node i is to
module q, q = 1, . . ., Q. The larger |
|, the more sim-
ilar node i is to the eigengene of the q-th module. In some
publications [14,15], 
 is referred to as signed mod-
ule eigengene (ME) based connectivity measure KME. This
is the reason why we named the corresponding R function
signedKME.
Automatic block-wise module detection
Many microarray gene expression measurements report
expression levels of tens of thousands of distinct genes (or
probes). Building and analyzing a full network among
such a large number of nodes can be computationally
challenging because of memory size and processor speed
limitations. The WGCNA package contains several
improvements that address this challenge. The function
blockwiseModules is designed to handle network con-
struction and module detection in large data sets. The

function first pre-clusters nodes into large clusters,
referred to as blocks, using a variant of k-means clustering
(function projectiveKMeans). Next, hierarchical clustering
is applied to each block and modules are defined as
branches of the resulting dendrogram. To synthesize the
module detection results across blocks, an automatic
module merging step (function mergeCloseModules) is
performed that merges modules whose eigengenes are
highly correlated. The time and memory savings of the
block-wise approach are substantial: a standard, single-
block network analysis of n nodes requires O(n2) memory
and O(n3) calculations, while the block-wise approach
with block size nb requires only O(
) memory and
O(n
) calculations, making an analysis of say 50 000
genes in blocks of 7 000 feasible on a standard computer.
Consensus module detection
When dealing with multiple adjacency matrices represent-
ing different networks, it can be interesting to find consen-
sus modules, defined as modules that are present in all or
most networks [12]. Intuitively, two nodes should be con-
nected in a consensus network only if all of the input net-
works agree on that connection. This naturally suggest to
define the consensus network similarity between two
nodes as the minimum of the input network similarities.
In certain cases it may be useful to replace minimum by a
suitable quantile (e.g. the first quartile) since the resulting
measure may be more robust. Consensus module detec-
tion can be performed step-by-step for maximum control
and exibility, or in one step using the function blockwise-
ConsensusModule that calculates consensus modules
across given data sets in a block-wise manner analogous to
the block-wise module detection in a single data set.
Category 3: Functions for module and gene selection
Finding biologically or clinically significant modules and
genes is a major goal of many co-expression analyses. The
definition of biological or clinical significance depends on
the research question under consideration. Abstractly
speaking, we define a gene significance measure as a func-
tion GS that assigns a non-negative number to each gene;
the higher GSi the more biologically significant is gene i. In
functional enrichment analysis, a gene significance meas-
ure could indicate pathway membership. In gene knock-
out experiments, gene significance could indicate knock-
out essentiality. A microarray sample trait T can be used to
define a trait-based gene significance measure as the abso-
lute correlation between the trait and the expression pro-
files, Equation 2. A measure of module significance can be
defined as average gene significance across the module
genes (Figure 3A). When dealing with a sample trait T, a
measure of statistical significance between the module
eigengene E and the trait T can be defined, for example,
using correlation (Equation 2) or a p-value (Equation 3)
obtained from a univariate regression model between E
and T. Modules with high trait significance may represent
pathways associated with the sample trait. Genes with
high module membership in modules related to traits
(Figure 3B) are natural candidates for further validation
[10,14,15,18].
Category 4: Functions for studying topological properties
Many topological properties of networks can be succinctly
described using network concepts, also known as network
statistics or indices [11,33]. Network concepts include
whole network connectivity (degree), intramodular con-
nectivity, topological overlap, the clustering coefficient,
density etc. Differential analysis of network concepts such
as intramodular connectivity may reveal regulatory
changes in gene expressions [15,18]. The WGCNA pack-
age implements several functions, such as softConnectiv-
ity, 
intramodularConnectivity, 
TOMSimilarity,
clusterCoef, networkConcepts, for computing these net-
work concepts. Basic R functions can be used to create
summary statistics of these concepts and for testing their
differences across networks.
Network concepts for measuring cluster structure
Gene clustering trees and TOM plots that visualize inter-
connectivity patterns often suggest the presence of large
modules. Network theory offers a wealth of intuitive net-
work concepts for describing the pairwise relationships
among genes that are depicted in cluster trees and heat
maps [11]. To illustrate this point, we describe two net-
work concepts in the following. By visual inspection of
Figures 2C and 4B, genes appear to be highly intercon-
nected, e.g. turquoise module genes form a reddish square
in the TOM plot. This property of dense connections
among the genes of module q can be measured using the
concept of module density, which is defined as the aver-
age adjacency of the module genes:
where A(q) denotes the n(q) × n(q) adjacency matrix corre-
sponding to the sub-network formed by the genes of mod-
ule q. Another useful concept is the clustering coefficient of
gene i, which is a measure of 'cliquishness' [34]. Specifi-

In unweighted networks, ClusterCoefi equals 1 if and only
if all neighbors of gene i are also linked to each other. For
weighted networks, 0 d aij d 1 implies that 0 d ClusterCoefi
d 1 [5]. The mean clustering coefficient has been used to
measure the extent of module structure present in a net-
work [26,34].
Category 5: Functions for simulating microarray data with 
modular structure
Simple yet sufficiently realistic simulated data is often
important for evaluation of novel data mining methods.
The WGCNA package includes simulation functions sim-
ulateDatExpr, 
simulateMultiExpr,
simulateDatExpr5Modules that result in expression data
sets with a customizable modular (cluster) structure. The
user can choose the modular structure by specifying a set
of seed eigengenes, one for each module, around which
each module is built. Module genes are simulated to
exhibit progressively lower correlations with the seed
which leads to genes with progressively lower intramodu-
lar connectivity. The user can specify module sizes and the
number of background genes, i.e. genes outside of the
modules. The seed eigengenes can be simulated to reflect
dependence relationships between the modules (function
simulateEigengeneNetwork).
Category 6: Visualization functions
Module structure and network connections in the expres-
sion data can be visualized in several different ways. For
example, the co-expression module structure can be visu-
alized by heatmap plots of gene-gene connectivity that
can be produced using the function TOMplot. Examples
are presented in Figures 2C and 4B. An alternative is a
multi-dimensional scaling plot; an example is presented
in Figure 2B. Relationships among modules can be sum-
marized by a hierarchical clustering dendrogram of their
eigengenes, or by a heatmap plot of the corresponding
eigengene network (function labeledHeatmap), illus-
trated in Figures 3C, D, and 4C, D. The package includes
several additional functions designed to aid the user in
visualizing input data and results. These functions rely on
basic plotting functions provided in R and the packages
sma [35] and fields [36].
Category 7: Functions for interfacing with other software 
packages
To enhance the integration of WGCNA results with other
network visualization packages and gene ontology analy-
sis software, we have created several R functions and cor-
responding tutorials. For example, our R functions
exportNetworkToVisANT 
and 
exportNetworkToCyto-
scape allow the user to export networks in a format suita-
ble for VisANT [37] and Cytoscape [38], respectively.
Our online R tutorials also show how to interface
WGCNA results with gene ontology packages available
directly in R, e.g. GOSim [39]. Many gene ontology based
functional enrichment analysis software programs such as
David [40], AmiGO [41], Webgestalt [42] simply take lists
of gene identifiers as input. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
allows the user to input gene expression data or gene iden-
tifiers.
Mouse Data Application
As an example of the type of analysis one can perform
with WGCNA, we describe a network analysis of liver
expression data from female mice. The data and biological
findings of this analysis have been described in [14].
Briefly, mRNA levels in female mouse livers were meas-
ured by microarrays with over 23,000 probe sets. In addi-
tion to the expression data, multiple physiological and
metabolic traits were measured. For computational rea-
sons, the original analysis presented in [14] was restricted
to 3600 most connected genes, and for simplicity we will
work with the same set of genes (although we note that
the presented package is capable of handling all genes as
well). While we do use the same data, the module detec-
tion methods are slightly different and the results are sim-
ilar but not the same. The code used to perform this
analysis is part of the tutorials posted on our webpage.
The network and the 18 identified modules are depicted
in Figures 4A, B. To understand the physiologic signifi-
cance of the modules, we correlated the 18 module eigen-
genes with physiological traits such as body weight,
cholesterol level, insulin level. The full module-trait corre-
lation table is presented in the accompanying tutorial.
In the following, we will only consider mouse body
weight as sample trait. The module eigengenes of the fol-
lowing three modules were highly correlated with body
weight: brown (409 genes, correlation with weight r =
0.59, correlation p-value p = 5 × 10-14), red (221 genes, r =
0.51, p = 3 × 10-10), and salmon (91 genes, r = 0.43, p = 2
× 10-7).
We used the online software David [40] to determine
whether the three body weight related modules were sig-
nificantly enriched with regard to known gene ontologies.
The brown module is significantly enriched in categories
"glycoprotein" (p = 2 × 10-24, Benjamini corrected) and
"signal" (p = 1 × 10-22). The red module is enriched in "cell
cycle" (p = 9 × 10-24) and "chromosome" (p = 5 × 10-20).
The salmon module is most significantly enriched in the
category "lipid synthesis" (p = 1 × 10-16). Overall, the high
enrichment scores suggest that these modules are indeed
biologically meaningful.

To study the relationships between modules, we correlate
their eigengenes. In general, relationships between mod-
ules can be studied by using correlation networks between
eigengenes (i.e. the nodes correspond to eigengenes). In
these meta-networks between modules, the adjacency
between modules reflects the correlation between the
module eigengenes, and modules of eigengenes are
referred to as meta-modules [12]. A sample trait such as
body weight can be incorporated as an additional node of
the eigengene network. The adjacency between the sample
trait and an eigengene is sometimes referred to as the
eigengene significance [11]. Figures 4C, D depict the
eigengene network using a dendrogram (hierarchical clus-
ter tree) and a heatmap plot. We find that eigengenes may
exhibit highly significant correlations, e.g. the red and
brown modules are highly correlated. Groups of corre-
lated eigengenes corresponds to meta-modules and are
recognizable as branches of the eigengene dendrogram,
and as reddish squares along the diagonal of the heatmap
plot. Figures 4C indicates that there are four meta-mod-
ules (branches). Body weight falls within the meta-mod-
ule grouping together the blue, brown, red, salmon, and
yellow modules. In practice, it is difficult to determine
whether the modules underlying a meta-module are truly
distinct or whether they should be merged. Sometimes
gene ontology information can provide some clues.
It is interesting to find centrally located intramodular hub
genes in the body weight related modules since their
expression profile represents that of the entire module
[11]. To find intramodular hub genes, one can use the
module membership measure K, Equation 6. Figure 4E
shows a scatterplot between the body weight based gene
significance measure GSi, Equation 2 and module mem-
bership in the brown module.
The high correlation between gene significance and mod-
ule membership implies that hubgenes in the brown
module also tend to be highly correlated with body
weight. This suggests that both gene significance and
module membership (intramodular connectivity) can be
combined in a systems biologic screening method for
finding body weight related genes [15]. Figure 4F shows a
Visant plot among the most connected genes in the brown
module. This brief description illustrates how WGCNA
can lead to testable hypotheses that require validation in
independent data sets. A tutorial underlying this example
and Figure 4 can be found on our webpage.
Tutorials
We provide a comprehensive set of online tutorials that
guide the user through major steps of correlation network
analysis. The tutorials provide R code the user can copy-
and-paste into an R session, along with comments and
explanations of both the input and output. The code is
organized into short sections, each of which addresses a
particular task. In particular, the tutorials cover the follow-
ing topics: correlation network construction, step-by-step
and automatic module detection, consensus module
detection, eigengene network analysis, differential net-
work analysis, interfacing with external software packages,
and data simulation. The tutorials use both simulated and
real gene expression data sets.
Discussion
The WGCNA package complements other network related
packages for R, such as the general network structures in
Bioconductor [6], gene network enrichment analysis [43],
functional analysis of gene co-expression networks [44],
and others. While most of the existing packages focus only
on unweighted networks, WGCNA implements methods
for both weighted and unweighted correlation networks.
WGCNA can be used as a data exploratory tool or as a
gene screening (ranking) method. For example, WGCNA
can be used to explore the module (cluster) structure in a
network, to measure the relationships between genes and
modules (module membership information), to explore
the relationships among modules (eigengene networks),
and to rank-order genes or modules (e.g. with regard to
their relationship with a sample trait). WGCNA can be
used to generate testable hypotheses for validation in
independent data sets. For example, WGCNA may suggest
that a module (e.g. a putative pathway) is associated with
a disease outcome. Since correlation networks are based
on correlations between quantitative variables, one can
use a correlation test p-value [1] or a regression-based p-
value for assessing the statistical significance between
pairs of variables. For example, it is straightforward to
attach a significance level to the fuzzy module member-
ship measures 
. The relationship between standard
microarray data mining techniques and gene co-expres-
sion network analysis is discussed in [11].
Users should be aware of the limitations of the methods
implemented in the WGCNA package. First, WGCNA
assumes that the microarray data have been properly pre-
processed and normalized. To normalize the expression
data, several R functions have been implemented in the
Bioconductor packages [45]. Although all normalization
methods are mathematically compatible with WGCNA,
we recommend to use the biologically most meaningful
normalization method with respect to the application
under consideration. Second, similar to most other data
mining methods, the results of WGCNA can be biased or
invalid when dealing with technical artefacts, tissue con-
taminations, or poor experimental design. Third,

although several co-expression module detection meth-
ods are implemented, the package does not provide
means to determine which method is best. While the
default hierarchical clustering methods have performed
well in several real data applications, it would be desirable
to compare these and other methods on multiple real
benchmark data sets. Fourth, this package is limited to
undirected networks. Methods for orienting edges and
constructing directed networks have been presented in the
literature, for example in [46-48].
Conclusion
The WGCNA R package provides a comprehensive set of
functions for performing weighted correlation network
analysis. The WGCNA package can also be used to
describe the correlation structure between gene expression
profiles, image data, genetic marker data, proteomics
data, and other high-dimensional data.
