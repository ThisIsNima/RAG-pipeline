Global energy consumption is projected to increase, even in the face of substantial declines in energy intensity, at least 2-fold by
midcentury relative to the present because of population and economic growth. This demand could be met, in principle, from fossil
energy resources, particularly coal. However, the cumulative nature of CO2 emissions in the atmosphere demands that holding atmo-
spheric CO2 levels to even twice their preanthropogenic values by midcentury will require invention, development, and deployment
of schemes for carbon-neutral energy production on a scale commensurate with, or larger than, the entire present-day energy supply
from all sources combined. Among renewable energy resources, solar energy is by far the largest exploitable resource, providing
more energy in 1 hour to the earth than all of the energy consumed by humans in an entire year. In view of the intermittency of
insolation, if solar energy is to be a major primary energy source, it must be stored and dispatched on demand to the end user. An
especially attractive approach is to store solar-converted energy in the form of chemical bonds, i.e., in a photosynthetic process at a
year-round average efﬁciency signiﬁcantly higher than current plants or algae, to reduce land-area requirements. Scientiﬁc chal-
lenges involved with this process include schemes to capture and convert solar energy and then store the energy in the form of
chemical bonds, producing oxygen from water and a reduced fuel such as hydrogen, methane, methanol, or other hydrocarbon
species.
T
he supply of secure, clean, sus-
tainable energy is arguably the
most important scientific and
technical challenge facing hu-
manity in the 21st century. Energy secu-
rity, national security, environmental
security, and economic security can
likely be met only through addressing
the energy problem within the next
10–20 yr. Meeting global energy de-
mand in a sustainable fashion will
require not only increased energy
efficiency and new methods of using
existing carbon-based fuels but also a
daunting amount of new carbon-neutral
energy. The various factors that con-
spire to support the above far-reaching
conclusions and the basic science
needed for the development of a large-
scale cost-effective carbon-neutral en-
ergy system are the focus of this paper.
The Global Energy Perspective
In 2001, worldwide primary energy con-
sumption was 425  1018 J, which is an
average energy consumption rate of 13.5
terawatt (TW) (1). Eight-six percent of
this energy was obtained from fossil
fuels, with roughly equal parts from oil,
coal, and natural gas. Nuclear power
accounted for 0.8 TW of primary
(thermal) energy, and the remainder of
the energy supply came mostly from un-
sustainable biomass, with a relatively
small contribution from renewable
sources (1).
Future energy demand is projected to
increase considerably relative to that in
2001. The most widely used scenarios for
future world energy consumption have
been those developed by the Intergovern-
mental Panel on Climate Change, an or-
ganization jointly established by the World
Meteorological Organization and the
United Nations Environment Program
(after Scenario B2 in ref. 2; E˙  (869 EJ
yr)(106 TJEJ)(606024365 syr) 
27.54 TW (TJ, terajoule; and EJ, exa-
joule). The scenario outlined in the last
two columns of Table 1 is based on ‘‘mod-
erate’’ assumptions and hence is reason-
ably viewed as neither overly conservative
nor overly aggressive.
To better understand this scenario,
the top half of Table 1 breaks down the
rate of energy consumption, E˙, into
three fundamental factors (3):
E˙  N(GDPN)(E˙GDP),
[1]
where N is the global population, GDPN
is the globally averaged gross domestic
product (GDP) per capita, and E˙GDP is
the globally averaged energy intensity (i.e.,
the energy consumed per unit of GDP).
The world population was 6.1 billion in
2001, and in the scenario represented in
Table 1, the global population is projected
to increase by 0.9% yr1 to 9.4 billion
by 2050. World per capita GDP was
$7,500 per capita in 2001. In the Table 1
scenario, GDPN is projected to increase
at the historical average rate of 1.4% yr1
to $15,000 per capita by 2050. No coun-
try has a policy against economic growth,
so this increase in GDPN seems quite
reasonable and in fact may well be modest
given the rapid economic growth being
experienced by China and India at
present. With no changes in the globally
averaged energy intensity, the world en-
ergy consumption rate would grow, due to
population growth and economic growth,
by 2.3% yr1, from 13.5 TW in 2001 to
40.8 TW in 2050. However, the global
average energy intensity has declined con-
tinuously over the past 100 yr, due to im-
provements in technology throughout the
energy production, distribution, and end-
use chain. In anticipation of continued
improvements in technology, the global
average energy intensity in the Table 1
scenario is projected to decrease at ap-
proximately the historical average rate of
0.8% yr1, from 0.29 W($ yr1) in 2001
to 0.20 W($ yr1) by 2050. This decrease
offsets somewhat the projected increases
in population and per capita GDP, so that
the world energy consumption rate is in-
stead projected to grow by 2.3% yr1 
0.8% yr1  1.5% yr1, from 13.5 TW in
2001 to 27 TW by 2050. Hence, even
factoring in a decrease in energy intensity,
the world energy consumption rate is pro-
jected to double from 13.5 TW in 2001 to
27 TW by 2050 and to triple to 43 TW by
2100 (4).
The Global Energy Challenge Presented
by Consumption of Fossil Fuels
Many sources indicate there are ample
fossil energy reserves, in one form or
another, to supply this energy at some
reasonable cost. The World Energy As-
sessment Report estimates of the total
reserves (i.e., 90% confidence that the

reserves exist) and of the global re-
source base (5), including both con-
ventional and unconventional sources,
provide a benchmark for evaluating the
total available global fossil energy base.
Based on 1998 consumption rates,
40–80 yr of proven conventional and
unconventional oil reserves exist glo-
bally, and 50–150 yr of oil are available
if the estimated resource base is in-
cluded. Sixty to 160 yr of reserves of
natural gas are present, and between
207 and 590 yr of gas resources, not
including the natural gas potentially
available as methane clathrates in the
continental shelves, are in the estimated
resource base. Similarly, a 1,000- to
2000-yr supply of coal, shales, and tar
sands is in the estimated resource base.
Hence the estimated fossil energy re-
sources could support a 25- to 30-TW
energy consumption rate globally for at
least several centuries.
Consumption of fossil energy at that
rate, however, will produce a potentially
significant global issue. Historically, the
mean carbon intensity (kg of C emitted to
the atmosphere as CO2 per year per W of
power produced from the fuel) of the
global energy mix has been declining. In
the past two centuries, the energy mix has
shifted from being dominated by wood to
coal to oil and now more to natural gas.
This shift has produced a decrease in the
average carbon intensity of the energy
mix, because oil and gas have higher HC
ratios and hence upon combustion pro-
duce more water and less CO2 per unit of
heat released than does coal. If the car-
bon intensity were to remain at the year
2001 value (approximately equal parts
coal, oil, and natural gas), the world car-
bon emission rate would grow due to the
projected growth in the energy consump-
tion from 6.6 billion metric tons of carbon
(GtC) yr1 in 2001 to 13.5 GtC yr1 by
2050. The Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change ‘‘business as usual’’ sce-
nario of Table 1 projects, arguably opti-
mistically, that the historical trend of
mean carbon intensity decline with time
will continue through 2050, producing an
energy mix continually favoring cleaner-
burning fuels from a carbon emissions
viewpoint, until the average in 2050 is be-
low that of the least carbon-intensive fossil
energy source, natural gas. This decrease
in carbon intensity would offset somewhat
the increase in the rate of energy con-
sumption. But even with this projected
decrease in carbon intensity, the world
carbon emissions rate in this scenario is
projected to nearly double from 6.6 GtC
yr1 in 2001 to 11.0 GtC yr1 by 2050 (2).
On the timescale of many centuries,
CO2 emissions are essentially cumulative
in the atmosphere. The CO2 equilibrates
on an 10- to 30-yr timescale between
the atmosphere and the near-surface
layer of the oceans (6), which accounts
for why only 50% of the anthropo-
genic CO2 emissions remain in the at-
mosphere (the remainder partitioning
into the biosphere and the oceans). Be-
cause there are no natural destruction
mechanisms of CO2 in the atmosphere,
the long-term removal of atmospheric
CO2 must occur by convection. The rel-
evant mixing time between the near-
surface ocean layer and the deep oceans
is between 400 and several thousand
years (6, 7). Hence, in the absence of
geoengineering or active intervention,
whatever environmental effects might be
caused by this atmospheric CO2 accu-
mulation over the next 40–50 yr will
persist globally for the next 500–2,000 yr
or more.
Although the precise future effects of
such anthropogenic CO2 emissions are
still somewhat uncertain, the emission
levels can certainly be viewed rigorously
within a historical perspective. The data
from the Vostok ice core indicate that
the atmospheric CO2 concentration has
been between 210 and 300 ppm for the
past 420,000 yr (8), and more recent
studies of Dome Concordia ice cores
have extended this time period to
650,000 yr (9). Over this same time pe-
riod, the atmospheric CO2 concentration
has been highly correlated with, but is
not necessarily the cause of, tempera-
ture swings that have repeatedly caused
ice ages on the planet. The CO2 concen-
trations in the past 50 yr have been
rising because of anthropogenic CO2
emissions from fossil fuel consumption,
and they are now in excess of 380 ppm.
Without intervention, even the Table 1
scenario produces, within the 21st cen-
tury, atmospheric CO2 concentrations
that are more than double the prean-
thropogenic values (4, 6). The exact
levels vary depending on the assumed
composition of energy sources, the effi-
ciency of energy production and con-
sumption, the global economy, and
different intervention scenarios to con-
trol CO2 levels. Modestly stringent
interventions are based on stabilizing
atmospheric CO2 in the 550- to 650-ppm
range, with substantially higher values
projected (750 ppm) if the Table 1
scenario is followed. Climate models
predict a variety of different global re-
sponses to levels of CO2 at or in excess
of 550 ppm in the atmosphere. In some
models, moderate changes are predicted,
whereas in others, relatively serious sea
level rises, changes in the hydrological
cycle, and other effects are predicted
(10). Tipping points involving positive
feedback, such as the accelerated loss of
permafrost, which could release further
CO2 which then could accelerate still
further permafrost loss, are of substan-
tive concern. What can be said with
certainty is that the atmospheric CO2
concentrations are being increased and
without severe intervention will con-

genic sources, to levels that have not
been present on the planet in at least
the past 650,000 yr and probably in the
past 20 million yr.
Carbon-Neutral Fuel Sources and the
Solar Opportunity
To meet the (arguably optimistic) Inter-
governmental Panel on Climate Change
projection in the Table 1 scenario for
the average carbon intensity in 2050, the
projected carbon intensity in 2050 is
0.45 kg of C yr1 W1, which is lower
than that of any of the fossil fuels. The
only way one can reach this value of the
mean carbon intensity is through a sig-
nificant contribution of carbon-free
power to the total energy mix. This con-
clusion holds for an economy entirely
based on natural gas; to the extent that
the mix of consumed fossil fuels is not
100% natural gas but is roughly also
equal parts oil and coal, even more
carbon-free energy is required to main-
tain the average of the energy mix at
the 0.45 kg of C yr1 W1 value. In fact,
the amount of carbon-free power re-
quired in 2050 to meet these carbon in-
tensity targets is 10 TW and is much
greater than 10 TW if emissions are to
be lowered such that CO2 can be stabi-
lized at 550 ppm. Even more carbon-
free power will be required later in the
21st century if CO2 levels are to be kept
below 550 ppm or if a lower atmo-
spheric CO2 target level is desired. By
almost any reasonable estimate, stabili-
zation of atmospheric CO2 levels at 550
ppm or lower will require as much
carbon-neutral power by approximately
the year 2050 as the amount of power
produced at present from all energy
sources combined (4). Furthermore, be-
cause CO2 emissions are cumulative on
a century-level timescale, even higher
levels of carbon-neutral power are re-
quired by 2050 if their introduction does
not start immediately with a constant
rampup but instead are delayed by 20 yr
for their commissioning while awaiting
technology development andor policy
and socioeconomic interventions.
Three general routes are available to
produce such large amounts of carbon-
neutral power.
Nuclear fission is one method, but it
would require widespread implementa-
tion of breeder reactors (11). Estimated
terrestrial U resources are sufficient to
produce 100 TW-yr of electricity using
conventional once-through U reactor
technology. Hence, if 10 TW of power
were obtained from conventional nu-
clear fission, the terrestrial U resource
base would be exhausted at that level in
less than a decade (in fact, it would be
exhausted after the first 30 yr of reactor
construction because of the fuel con-
sumed during the rampup phase). More-
over, construction of nuclear power
plants would need to proceed at a very
rapid rate by historical standards (one
1-GWe (gigawatt-electric) power plant
every 1.6 days for the next 45 yr). The
international tokamak (magnetic con-
finement fusion) experiment (ITER) is
now scheduled to demonstrate an en-
ergy breakeven point in 35 yr for a few
minutes of operational time. Although
fusion might possibly provide significant
commercial energy late in the 21st cen-
tury, the ITER time line is much too far
in the future to provide a credible op-
tion to make a significant contribution
to the amount of cost-effective carbon-
neutral energy production needed to
meet any reasonable atmospheric CO2
concentration target in the next 40–50 yr.
Carbon capture and storage comprise
a second general approach (12). In this
approach, the carbon dioxide is dis-
solved in the underground aquifers. To
be a viable option technically, the CO2
must not leak at a globally averaged rate
of 1% for a timescale of centuries. Oth-
erwise, the emitted flux will be greater
than or equal to that intended to be
mitigated initially. Experiments at scale
are needed, along with extensive model-
ing, simulation, monitoring, and valida-
tion, to ascertain with 99% confidence
that the leak rate will be acceptably low
for a 500- to 1,000-yr period. Further-
more, each reservoir is different geolog-
ically, so proof that sequestration works
technically at one reservoir is not gen-
eral proof that the process will work at
the required level globally. The global
reservoir capacity has been estimated to
be equivalent to 100–150 yr of carbon
emissions. Hence, sequestration could
buy time if it works technically and is so
validated within the next 10–20 yr. An
additional condition is that the energy
distribution and end-use chain must be
transformed to handle massive quanti-
ties of carbon-free fuels (hydrogen) or
electricity on the needed timescale to
mitigate carbon emissions.
The third general approach is to use
renewable energy. Of the various renew-
able energy sources, by far the largest
resource is provided by the sun. More
energy from sunlight strikes the earth in
1 hr (4.3  1020 J) than all of the en-
ergy currently consumed on the planet
in 1 yr (4.1  1020 J in 2001) (5). Yet,
in 2001, only 0.1% of electricity and
1.5% of fuels (mostly from biomass)
were provided by a solar source (1).
Against the backdrop of the daunting
carbon-neutral energy needs of our
global future, the large gap between our
present use of solar energy and its enor-
mous undeveloped potential defines a
compelling imperative for science and
technology in the 21st century.
Solar Energy Utilization
Solar energy utilization requires solar (i)
capture and conversion and (ii) storage.
Solar capture and conversion may be
accomplished by photovoltaics (PVs).
The challenge here is to dramatically
reduce the cost per W of delivered solar
electricity. Compared with fossil energy,
solar energy is diffuse, and hence mate-
rials costs must be very inexpensive to
make a solar-based process economical.
Knowing the insolation striking an area
of the earth for a 30-yr period, it is rela-
tively simple to calculate the sale price
of the converted energy that is needed
to pay back at least the initial cost that
is required to cover that area with the
solar energy conversion system. At 10%
efficiency, and a cost of $300 m2, both
typical of current Si-based solar electric-
ity modules, along with a balance of
systems cost of $3 Wp1 (peak W), an
electricity price of $0.35 [kW-hr]1 is
required to cover the initial system costs
(13). By comparison, fossil-derived elec-
tricity (high-value energy) now costs ap-
proximately $0.02–0.05 [kW-hr]1, and
that cost includes storage and distribu-
tion costs. To reach a cost point near
that of fossil-derived energy will thus
require improvements in efficiency but
additionally will require large decreases
in cost, into a range below $100 m2.
For comparison, the cost of paint is
about $1 m2, so the solar energy con-
version system can cost 10 times more
than the cost of paint, but not much
more if it is to provide cost-effective
primary energy.
In the absence of cost-effective stor-
age, solar electricity can never be a pri-
mary energy source for society, because
of the diurnal variation in local insola-
tion. In principle, storage of electricity
could be obtained using batteries, but
at present no battery is inexpensive
enough, when amortized over the 30-yr
lifetime of a solar device, to satisfy the
needed cost per W targets for the whole
system. A second method is to store the
electrical energy mechanically. For in-
stance, electricity could be used to drive
turbines to pump water uphill. This ap-
proach is relatively inexpensive for
storing large amounts of energy at mod-
est charge and discharge rates, but is not
well matched to being charged and dis-
charged every 24 h to compensate for
the diurnal cycle. For example, buffering
the daynight cycle in the U.S. energy
demand by this approach would require
a pumping capacity equivalent of
5,000 Hoover Dams, filling and empty-
ing reservoirs every day and every night.
Currently, the cheapest method of solar

energy capture, conversion, and storage
is solar thermal technology, which can
cost as little as $0.10–0.15 per kW-hr
for electricity production. Advances in
this potentially very important approach
to solar energy utilization will require
new materials for the focusing and ther-
mal capture of the energy in sunlight, as
well as new thermochemical cycles for
producing useful fuel from the captured
solar energy. The possibility of inte-
grated capture, conversion, and storage
functions makes solar thermal technol-
ogy an option that should be vigorously
pursued to exploit the large untapped
solar energy resource for carbon-neutral
energy production
A third method of storage is to bor-
row the design of nature, in which
chemical bonds are broken and formed
to produce solar fuels in an artificial
photosynthesis process. Photosynthesis
itself is relatively inefficient, when mea-
sured on a yearly average basis per unit
area of insolation. For example, switch-
grass, one of the fastest-growing crops,
yields energy stored in biomass at a
yearly averaged rate of 1 Wm2 (5).
Because the averaged insolation at a
typical midlatitude is 200–300 Wm2
(5), the yearly averaged energy conver-
sion and storage efficiency of the most
rapidly growing large area crops is cur-
rently 0.5%. Even if this efficiency
could be reached with no energy inputs
into the farm or any energy losses due
to outputs from the utilization of the
biomass, growth of energy crops on all
of the naturally irrigated cultivatable
land on earth that is not currently used
for food crops would yield perhaps 5–10
TW of total power. Whereas biofuels
derived from existing plants could pro-
vide a potentially significant contribu-
tion to liquid fuels for transportation
uses (if cellulosic conversion technology
can be successfully developed and de-
ployed economically) increased energy
conversion and storage efficiency are
highly desirable to remove land area as
a serious constraint on the amount of
energy that can be obtained from the
sun and stored in chemical bonds. One
approach is to develop an artificial pho-
tosynthetic process with an average effi-
ciency significantly higher than plants or
algae.
The primary steps of photosynthesis
involve the conversion of sunlight into a
‘‘wireless current.’’ In all cases, to form
a useful fuel, O2 must be evolved, so it
can be released into our oxygen-contain-
ing atmosphere and used elsewhere as
an oxidation reagent for fuel consump-
tion. The reduced fuel could be either
hydrogen from water reduction, or it
could be an organic species, such as
methanol or methane, that is derived
from the fixation of atmospheric CO2.
Recombination of the reduced fuel with
released O2 would then regenerate the
original species, closing the cycle in a
carbon-neutral fashion.
In natural photosynthesis, the anodic
charge of the wireless current is used at
the oxygen-evolving complex to oxidize
water to oxygen, with the concomitant
release of four protons. The cathodic
charge of the wireless current is cap-
tured by Photosystem I to reduce the
protons to ‘‘hydrogen,’’ with the reduced
hydrogen equivalents stored through the
conversion of NADP to NADPH. Thus,
the overall primary events of photosyn-
thesis store sunlight by the rearrange-
ment of the chemical bonds of water,
to form oxygen and Nature’s form of
hydrogen.
An artificial photosynthetic system
could be realized by spatially separating
solid-state or molecular water reduction
and oxidation catalysts and connecting
them to a light collection and charge
separation system. In one such con-
struct, the spatially separated electron–
hole pairs provided by a photovoltaic
assembly based on a solid-state junction,
on either the macroscale or the
nanoscale, are captured by the catalysts,
and the energy is stored in the bond
rearrangement of water to H2 and O2.
Other concepts involve more intimate
integration of the charge separation and
chemical bond-forming functions, to
avoid costs and system constraints asso-
ciated with electrical contacts, wires,
inverters, etc., involved with converting
1-eV photons into 1-eV chemical bonds
through electricity as a discrete interme-
diary. One approach to this type of sys-
tem is depicted in Fig. 1, in which the
tightly integrated system is modeled af-
ter natural photosynthesis and serves as
a model for the artificial photosynthetic
systems that are discussed below.
The Basic Science Needs for PVs
One of the key issues in solar capture
and conversion is how to separate
charge efficiently over macroscopic dis-
tances without using expensive, highly
pure, semiconductor materials. This ef-
fort requires the development of new
chemical and materials methods to
make polycrystalline and nanocrystalline
semiconductors perform as if they were
expensive single crystals. Numerous re-
search approaches are being pursued
(13). Materials consisting of a network
of interpenetrating regions can facilitate
effective charge separation and collec-
tion, thus relaxing the usual constraint
in which the photogenerated carriers
must exist long enough to traverse the
entire distance of the cell. Present
photon conversion devices based on a
single-bandgap absorber, including semi-
conductor PV, have a theoretical ther-
modynamic conversion efficiency of
32% in unconcentrated sunlight. How-
ever, the conversion efficiency can be
increased, in principle, to 45–65% if car-
rier thermalization can be prevented (by
overcoming the so-called Shockley–
Queisser limit). Multiple-bandgap
absorbers in a cascaded junction config-
uration can result in high photoconver-
sion efficiencies, particularly when cells
are designed to sustain the operating
conditions (e.g., elevated temperatures)
associated with highly concentrated sun-
light. It is expected that mature high-
concentration PV systems can provide
10–20% more energy than standard PV
systems with the same installed power

changes to existing PV technologies,

H2 and O2 are combined in a fuel cell to generate a ﬂow of electrons and protons across a
membrane, producing electrical energy. The solar fuel cell uses light to run the electron and proton ﬂow
in reverse. Coupling the electrons and protons to catalysts breaks the bonds of water and makes the bonds
H2 and O2 to effect solar fuel production.

new materials for next-generation PVs
are needed. Building upon the recent
success in developing efficient molecular
organic PVs and the recent advances in
the controlled assembly of hybrid organ-
icinorganic nanostructures, organic and
hybrid PV cells could possibly exceed
10% energy conversion efficiency, while
offering a potentially inexpensive manu-
facturing paradigm (e.g., casting from
emulsions, printing, and use of flexible
substrates for production of large-area
thin-film cells; ref. 14). To guide the PV
nanostructure assembly, biologically de-
rived andor genetically engineered
systems might be used to control the
crystal structure, phase, orientation, and
nanostructural regularity of inorganic
materials. Genetically modified photo-
synthetic complexes from plants and
bacteria can also convert incident light
into photocurrent. Although the present
energy conversion efficiencies of such
systems are low, the projected maximum
could be possibly as high as 10%. Fi-
nally, the Shockley–Queisser limit may
be overcome by using multilayer junc-
tions of semiconductor quantum dots,
quantum wells and related nanostruc-
tures, and new inorganic materials and
photoassemblies. Such materials could
channel the excess energy of electron
hole pairs into photovoltages and pho-
tocurrents, with the design guided by a
refined detailed understanding of pho-
ton absorption, charge creation, and
charge separation processes.
The Basic Science Needs for Solar Fuels
As described above, an important storage
approach involves conversion of the en-
ergy captured in the charge-separated
states of a solar capture and conversion
system into chemical bonds. Water split-
ting is an example of a more general con-
version to a solar fuel cycle that involves
evolution of oxygen as one component
and formation of a reduced fuel as the
other. Unexplored basic science issues are
immediately confronted when the prob-
lem is posed in the simplest chemistry
framework (see Scheme 1).
The overall transformation is a mul-
tielectron process promoted by photo-
catalyst and light. Elucidation of the
fundamental principles of single elec-
tron-transfer reactions represented
such an important milestone in chemis-
try that two Nobel Prizes were
awarded for such work (15, 16). Al-
though dramatic advances have oc-
curred in our understanding of single
electron-transfer reactions, especially
those in biology (17), a similar level of
understanding of multielectron redox
reactions has yet to be realized. More-
over, to ensure charge neutrality in the
system, proton transfer must accom-
pany electron transfer (i.e., proton-
coupled electron transfer; ref. 18);
hence, electron and proton inventories
both need to be managed (19). Water
splitting additionally presents sizable
thermodynamic and kinetics barriers
to making and breaking the bonds re-
quired to facilitate the desired chemi-
cal reactions. This is especially
pertinent to the water-splitting prob-
lem, because the byproduct of water
activation at the catalyst, whether mo-
lecular or solid, will invariably yield
species that have strong metal–oxygen
bonds. To close a catalytic cycle, these
stable bonds need to be activated by
the captured solar energy either di-
rectly or indirectly. More generally, the
activation of all small molecules of
consequence to carbon-neutral solar
energy storage, including CO2, O2, and
H2O, share the reaction commonalities
of bond-making and -breaking pro-
cesses that require multielectron trans-
fers coupled to proton transfer.
The Reaction Chemistry of Solar Energy
Storage in Chemical Bonds
Perhaps the most straightforward water-
splitting scheme is to have catalysts act
directly on water, as exemplified by the
two half-reactions denoted as WS1 (WS1,
water-splitting strategy 1) in Scheme 2.
The spatial separation of the catalysts re-
quires that the charge-separation function
be imbedded in some type of membrane,
so that the protons generated on the an-
odic side of the cell are transported to the
cathodic side of the cell for reduction. In
effect, the system must be run in the
opposite direction of a fuel cell, with
sunlight providing the thermodynamic
impetus to drive the cell in the desired
fuel-forming direction.
The preparation of hydrogen-produc-
ing catalysts constitutes an intense area
of study. Fe-only hydrogenases, com-
prised of small dithiolate-bridged bime-
tallic iron cofactors coordinated by CO
and cyanide ligands, provide a bench-
mark for the efficient evolution of H2 in
molecular systems (20, 21). Structural,
and in some cases, functional, analogues

of such enzymatic active sites have been
prepared (22–27); however, none of
these Fe-only hydrogenase biomimics yet
produce H2 efficiently at low overpoten-
tial. Synthetic catalysts compare favor-
ably to, and in some cases exceed, the
efficiency of the biomimetic models. In
the presence of sacrificial chemical re-
ductants, mononuclear and binuclear
metal complexes of Co, Ni, and Rh are
known to effect catalytic hydrogen evo-
lution electrochemically or photochemi-
cally (28–36). Intimate mechanistic
details, however, are known in only a
few cases (37), and the different possi-
bilities, such as protonation of a hydride
vs. uni- or bimolecular reductive elimi-
nation (right side, WS1, Scheme 2), in
general have not yet been unraveled.
Other water-splitting cycles can also
be developed. The water-splitting
schemes WS2 and WS3 presented in
Scheme 2 use basic reaction types that
are common to organometallic catalysis.
However, for the water-splitting prob-
lem, O, as opposed to C or N, needs to
be managed. Every reaction, however,
does have a precedent for carbon or ni-
trogen. In WS2 in Scheme 2, oxidative
addition across XOH (X  C, N) bonds
is a basic reaction of organometallic
chemistry but is not yet well established
for water (38–43). If this reaction can
be achieved cleanly, hydrogen may be
generated by -H abstraction, which is a
common reaction in organometallic
chemistry and is used to generate met-
al–ligand multiple bonds. For instance,
the -H abstraction of metal alkylidenes
produces alkylidynes (44). But -H ab-
straction to produce metal-oxo species,
and H2 is uncommon for well defined
hydroxo–hydrido complexes. In the case
of WS3, the water–gas shift reaction
produces H2 from H2O using CO as the
reductant. An intense research effort,
beginning in the 1970s and ending in the
1980s, provided the basic science for the
development of catalysts to effect the
water–gas shift reaction (45). However,
the reaction must be closed by the con-
version of CO2 to CO. On this front,
little is known. Some inroads to CO2
reduction have been made on photo–
(46, 47) and electro– (48–50) catalytic
fronts, but generally the precise path to
CO2 reduction is ill-defined, making it
difficult to improve these systems by
design. A recent report of CO2 reduc-
tion by a well defined homogeneous
metal complex operating at high turn-
over number and frequency (51) is a
harbinger of the promise that basic sci-
ence holds for the design of efficient
CO2 reduction catalysts.
As in WS1, WS2 and WS3 cycles are
closed by oxygen production, providing
a further imperative for the develop-
ment of reactions of the type described
by Schemes 3–5. However, very few cat-
alysts are known to oxidize water near
the thermodynamic potential. Again, the
most notable system is in biology, spe-
cifically involving the oxygen-evolving
complex (OEC) of Photosystem II. The
OEC comprises a cluster of four Mn
centers and a Ca center (52–54), but no
functional or structural models of the
catalytically active site are yet available
(55). At present, the ruthenium dimer
[(bpy)2(OH2)RuIIIORuIII(OH2)(bpy)2]4
(bpy  2,2-bipyridine) (56) and its
relatives (57–59) represent the only un-
equivocally established molecular elec-
trocatalysts for generating O2 from
H2O. However, at present, this reaction
proceeds at a high overpotential and
with modest turnover numbers.
The success of WS1, WS2, and WS3
and other yet-undefined water-splitting
schemes is predicated on systems that
promote the conversion of oxygen from
metal oxos. Many mechanistic possibili-
ties for this conversion await discovery.
They include the following.
(i) Nucleophilic Attack of Hydroxide on
High-Valent Metal Oxos (Scheme 3). This
basic reaction type is the foundation on
which oxidation catalysts have been devel-
oped in the disciplines of organometallic
and organic chemistry (60). Here the ole-
fin bond attacks a metal oxo species to
form two carbon–oxygen bonds. The re-
placement of the two-electron bond of the
olefin by the lone pair of hydroxide would
lead to the oxygen–oxygen bond-forming
reaction that is critical for water oxidation.
The substitution, however, is not trivial.
OH is thermodynamically more difficult
to oxidize than are olefins. Also, the over-
all reaction to produce oxygen involves a
four-electron change at the metal, so
there may be benefits to examining reduc-
tive elimination from more than one
metal center, in which the multielectron
equivalency can be shared by metal cen-
ters working in concert.
(ii) Radical Coupling of Two Oxos (Scheme
4). As shown, the oxygen radical may be
delivered directly from a high-valent
metal. Alternatively, the oxo species
could be delivered from a multiply
bonded metal–ligand species (61). This
latter approach represents a paradigm
shift in oxygen chemistry, because the
strong metal–oxo double and triple
bonds may be avoided, potentially low-
ering the activation barrier for oxygen
atom delivery from a reactive multiply
bonded metal–ligand center.
(iii) Reductive Elimination of bis Hydroxos
or bis -Oxos (Scheme 5). These unknown
reaction types encompass a four-electron
change to make oxygen. A shared electron
equivalency among a multimetallic center
may expedite the reaction, such as that
shown for Scheme 6.
In Scheme 2, the WS cycles are com-
pleted by the same parent metal complex.
This does not have to be the case. As has
recently been demonstrated, metal com-
plexes working in tandem can promote
reactions of energy consequence (62). Ac-
cordingly, the water-splitting schemes may
be accomplished by two different metal
complexes working in concert. Regardless
of the precise details of the reaction de-
sign, oxygen production invariably will be
an energetically demanding process that
must be coupled to a charge-separated
state to capture, convert, and store solar
energy in the form of chemical bonds. By
use of a photovoltaic assembly to accom-
plish solar-driven charge separation, the
constraints on the catalyst design are re-
laxed solely to provide storage. However,
in bringing catalysts to a charge-separating
assembly, the reaction chemistry will be
performed in a heterogeneous andor
interfacial environment. Accordingly, the
need to acquire a molecular-level under-
standing of reactions at the surfaces of
solids represents another scientific chal-
lenge confronting the effective utilization
of solar energy. Finally, inasmuch as the
aforementioned reactions and schemes are
all enacted at a metal-based platform, the
role of inorganic chemistry, whether at a
Scheme 3.

molecule or a surface, will be pivotal to
the development of the aforementioned
water-splitting cycles. Ingenious ap-
proaches to water splitting may be possi-
ble using organic catalysts and biocatalysts
as well, although the ability to operate
these reactions at low overpotential will
represent a significant challenge.
Conclusions
The sun has a unique role in sustainable
energy production, in that it is the un-
disputed champion of energy; the
resource base presented by terrestrial
insolation far exceeds that of all other
renewable energy sources combined.
The solar energy resource additionally
far exceeds what can possibly be envi-
sioned as a level of human consumption
necessary to support even the most
technologically advanced society. How-
ever, to be a material contribution to
primary energy supply, solar energy
must be captured, converted, and stored
to overcome the diurnal cycle and the
intermittency of the terrestrial solar re-
source. Arguably the most attractive
method for this energy conversion and
storage is in the form of chemical
bonds, by production of cheap solar
fuels. Significant advances in basic sci-
ence, however, are needed for this
technology to attain its full potential.
Chemistry will assume a special role in
this endeavor, because new materials
must be created for solar capture and
conversion, and because new catalysts
are needed for the desired chemical
bond conversions. Here we present a
blueprint for a reaction chemistry, when
interfaced to a charge-separation struc-
ture, that permits artificial photosynthe-
sis to be envisioned. The progress of
scientists in chemistry, biology, engi-
neering, materials science, and physics
in addressing the basic science chal-
lenges involved with realizing this artifi-
cial photosynthesis will be critical to
enable humans to use the sun sustain-
ably as their primary energy source.
