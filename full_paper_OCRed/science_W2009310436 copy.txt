ABSTRACT
The University of Wisconsin Genetics
Computer
Group
(UWGCG)
has
been
organized
to
develop computational tools
for the analysis and publication of
biological
sequence data.
A group of programs that will
interact
with
each
other
has
been
developed
for the Digital Equipment Corporation VAX computer
using the VMS operating system.
The programs available and the conditions
for
transfer
are described.
INTRODUCTION
The
rapid advances
in the field of molecular genetics
and DNA sequencing
have made
it imperative
for many laboratories
to
use computers
to analyze
and
manage
sequence
data.
UWGCG
was
founded
when it became clear
to several
faculty members
at the University of Wisconsin that the there was
no
set
of
sequence
analysis
programs
that could be used together
as
a coherent
system
and be modified easily in response
to new ideas.
With intramural
support
a computer
group was organized
to build
a
strong
foundation
of software
upon which future
programs in molecular genetics could
be based.
This initial project has been completed and the resulting programs,
written in Fortran 77,
are available for VAX computers using the VMS operating
system.
Most of the
programs
can be
used
with
only
a
terminal,
although
several require
a Hewlett Packard plotter.
UWGCG
software
has
been
installed
for
testing
at
eight
different
institutions.
A
simple
method
has
been
developed
for
transferring
and
maintaining this system on other VAX computers.
DESIGN PRINCIPLES
UWGCG
program
design
is
based
on
the
"software
tools"
approach of
Kernighan and Plauger(l).
Each program performs
a simple function and
is easy
to
use.
The programs
can be used independently in different combinations

that complex problems are solved by the use of several programs in succession.
New
programming
is
simplified since less effort is required to bridge a gap
between existing programs.
UWGCG software is designed to be maintained and modified at
sites
other
than
the
University
of
Wisconsin.
The program manual is extensive and the
source codes are organized to make modification convenient.
Scientists
using
UWGCG
software
are
encouraged
to
use existing programs
as
a framework for
developing new ones.
Our copyright can be removed from any
program
modified
by more than 25% of our original effort.
PROGRAMS AVAILABLE FROM UWGCG
The
programs
described
below are named and defined individually in Table
1.
Program names in the text are underlined.
Comparisons
Comparisons may be done with "dot plots" using the method of
Maizel
and
Lenk(2).
Optimal alignments can be generated by the methods of Needleman and
Wunsch(3), of Sellers(4),
and
the
"local
homology"
method
of
Smith
and
Waterman(5).
The
Smith
and
Waterman
alignment algorithm is also the most
sensitive method available for identifying similarities between weakly related
sequences.
Mapping and Searching
Mapping is available in several formats.
Graphic maps display all of the
cuts for
each
restriction
enzyme
on
parallel
lines.
This
graphic
map
facilitates
selection
of enzymes for isolating any region of a sequenced DNA
molecule.
Sorted maps in
tabular
format
arrange
the
fragments
from
any
digestion
in order of molecular weight to show which fragments are similar in
size and thus likely to be confused in gels.
Another frequently used
mapping
format,
designed by Frederick Blattner(6), displays the enzyme cuts above the
original DNA sequence.
Both
strands
of
the
DNA
and
all
six
frames
of
translation are shown.
All
mapping
programs will search for user-specified sequences, allowing
features
to be marked at the appropriate position on a restriction
map.
The
mapping
and
searching
programs can be used to aid site-specific mutagenesis
experiments by showing where mutations could generate new
restriction
sites.
All of the positions in a sequence where a synthetic probe could pair with one
or more mismatches can also be located.
Sequences related to
less
precisely
defined
features
such as promoters or intervening sequence splice sites, can
be located with a program that uses a consensus
sequence
as
a
probe.

mapping
programs
can
also
be
used
on
protein
sequences
to identify the
peptides resulting from proteolytic cleavage.
Secondary Structure
Three programs are available to examine secondary
structure
in
nucleic
acids.
The
program
StemLoop
identifies
all
inverted
repeats.
An
implementation of Dr. Michael Zuker's Fold program(7)
finds
an
RNA
secondary
structure
of
minimum
free
energy based on published values of stacking and
roop destabilizing energies.
The "dot plot" comparison (mentioned above) of a
sequence
compared
to
its
opposite
strand
gives
a graphic picture of the
pattern of inverted repeats
in a sequence.
Analysis of Composition and the Location of Genetic Domains
Regions of a sequence with non-random base distribution can be
displayed
with
three
graphic
tools designed to identify genetic domains.
The program
CodonPreference(8) identifies potential coding regions
by
searching
through
each
reading
frame
for
a
pattern
of
preferred
codon
choices.
The
CodonPreference plot predicts
the level of translational expression
of
mRNAs
and
helps
identify
frame
shifts
in
DNA sequence data.
Patterns of codon
choice can be compared with the program Correspond(9).
When a strong
pattern
of
codon preferences
is not expected,
the "TestCode" statistic of Fickett(10)
can be plotted to show regions of
compositional
constraint
at
every
third
base.
Another
program
plots
asymmetries of composition by strand.
Strand
asymmetries
have
been
associated
with
genetic
domains
by
several
authors(ll)(12).
A
fourth
program called Frame marks the positions of rare
codons and open reading frames on a graph showing all six reading frames.
Several tools are available to measure content and to count dinucleotide,
trinucleotide,
neighbor
and repeat frequencies.
A program that predicts RNA
fingerprint patterns and another that tabulates codon frequencies complete the
group of programs that analyze composition.
Sequence Manipulation
Sequences
may
be
entered,
assembled,
edited,
reversed,
randomized,
reformatted,
translated,
back-translated,
documented,
transferred,
or
encrypted rapidly with a large set of sequence manipulation tools.
A screen-oriented editor is available that allows sequences to be entered
and
checked.
After
a
sequence
is
entered,
it
may
be
reentered
for
proofreading.
Whenever a reentered base is at variance with the original,
the
terminal bell rings and the position is marked.
Existing
sequences
can
be
edited quickly by moving directly to a sequence position specified by either a
coordinate or a sequence pattern.
The program
can
reassign
the
terminal's
390

keys
to place G, A, T and C conveniently under the fingers of one hand in the
same order as
the lanes of a sequencing gel.
Programs are available for changing sequence file format.
Sequence
data
from
any
source can be used in UWGCG programs, and sequence files maintained
with UWGCG software can be converted
for use in other non-UWGCG programs.
For
instance,
the
programs of Roger Staden(13) or Intelligenetics Inc.(14) could
be used to assemble a sequence from the sequences of many small
sub-fragments
generated
by
DNAase
I
digestion.
The
assembled
sequence
could
then be
reformatted for use in
any
UWGCG
program.
A
program
is
available
that
transfers sequences
to and from other computers.
Sequence Publication
A
program,
Publish,
will
format
sequences into figures.
Publish has
alternatives for line size, numbering, scaling, translation and comparison
to
other sequences.
Poster is a program that will plot text on figures.
GENERAL FEATURES OF UWGCG SOFTWARE
Interactive Style
Each
program is run by simply typing its name.
Every parameter required
by the program is obtained interactively.
Questions are answered with a
file
name,
a
yes,
a
no,
a number, or a letter from a menu.
Default answers are
displayed.
Programs are insensitive
to
absurd
answers
and
will
ask
the
question again if,
for instance, you name a file that does not exist or if you
use a nonnumeric character when typing a number.
Special
features
such
as
plotting features oriented to publication, are obtained by using an extra word
next to the program's name when the program is run.
Thus
parameter
queries
are kept to a minimum for the normal use of each program.
Data
Both
the
NIH-GenBank(15)
and
the
EMBL(16)
nucleotide
sequence data
libraries are available "on-line" to any UWGCG program.
A Search utility will
locate
sequences
in
the
libraries by key word.
A Find utility will locate
library entries containing any specified sequence.
A
program
is
available
that
installs
the new data sent periodically from GenBank and EMBL
to update
their data libraries.
All of the data in the system are stored in text files that can
be
read
and
modified
easily.
Every data file has an English heading describing the
contents.
The data
files
may
be
copied
by
each
user
for
analysis
or
modification.
Programs
recognize
and
read
user-modified
input
data
automatically.
Data files can be modified with any text editor.

Sequence File Structure
Sequences are maintained in files that allow documentation and
numbering
both
above and within the sequence.
This file format is compatible with both
of the nucleic acid sequence libraries and has been adopted
as
the
standard
sequence
file
format
by
the
data
base
project at the European Molecular
Biology Lab.
Because genetic manipulations commonly involve
linking
several
molecules
of
known
sequence,
UWGCG
sequence files are designed to support
concatenation by allowing comments
to
appear
within
the
sequences
at
any
location.
Coding
sequences
or
the
boundaries
between cloning vector and
insert,
for instance, can be marked within the sequence itself
for
immediate
identification.
Sequence Symbols
All
possible
nucleotide
ambiguities
and all standard one-letter amino
acid codes are part of the UWGCG
symbol
set
that
includes
all
alphabetic
characters
plus
five additional characters.
The proposed IUB-IUPAC standard
nucleotide ambiguity symbols(17)
are
used
for
the
mapping,
searching
and
comparison
programs.
Lower case characters are used in sequences to indicate
uncertainty as distinct from ambiguity.
This allows
the
entire
lexicon
of
symbols
to
be
reused
with same meaning, but with the prefix "maybe-." This
reuse of the symbol set in lower
case
makes
the
uncertainty
symbols
more
complete, understandable and visible.
Symbol Comparison
Sequence
analysis
programs
generally make comparisons between sequence
symbols (bases
or
amino
acids)
in
order
to
find
enzyme
sites,
create
alignments,
locate inverted repeats etc.
These symbol comparisons are handled
in several ways.
Symbol comparisons for
alignment,
comparison
and
secondary
structure
analysis
are
made by looking up a value in a symbol comparison table for the
quality of the match.
The table might contain l's for
matches
and
O's
for
mismatches.
If
amino acids are being compared, however,
a real number could
be assigned at each
position
based
on
some
previously
assigned
chemical
similarity of the pair of residues or on the mutational distance between their
codons.
Standard symbol tables are provided
by
UWGCG,
but
the
system
is
designed to allow each user to specify his own values.
Symbols comparisons for mapping and searching operations in nucleic acids
are made by converting the IUB-IUPAC symbols into a binary code.
The bits
of
this code represent G, A,
T and C with ambiguity symbols causing more than one
392


----- Page 7 (native text) -----
Nucleic Acids Research
bit to be set.
A group of library functions identify overlap between the bits
for each IUB-IUPAC symbol.
Documentation
Documentation
is
available
both
in
printed
form and on the terminal
screen.
A 350 page manual describes the operatign of each program in
detail,
gives practical considerations and shows what will appear on the screen during
a session with the program.
Output files and plots are shown for the session.
The
data
for
the
session
shown in the documentation are included with the
system so that the each program's operation can
be
checked.
The
"on-line"
documentation is the same as the manual, but can be changed immediately when a
program is modified.
All programs write output to files that
are
completely
documented
and
sensibly
organized
for input to other programs.
The input data,
the program
and the parameters used are clearly identified in every output file.
Procedure Library
UWGCG programs
are
written
largely
as
calls
to
a
library
of
250
procedures
designed to manipulate biological sequences.
These procedures use
data and
file
structures
which
have
been
designed
to
simplify
program
modification.
For
instance,
standard
operations such as reading sequences
from files are always handled by a single library procedure.
Thus
a change in
sequence
file
format requires only one subroutine to be modified for the new
format to be acceptable to
all
of
the
programs
in
the
system.
Command
procedures
are
available
to help modify the library.
The procedure library
can be used by programs written in any language.
DISTRIBUTION OF UWGCG SOFTWARE
Intent
The intent of UWGCG is
to make
its
software
available
at
the
lowest
possible cost to as many scientists as possible.
Fees
A
fee
of $2,000 for non-profit institutions or $4,000 for industries is
being charged for a tape and documentation for each computer
on
which
UWGCG
software
is
installed.
While no continuing fee is required, UWGCG software,
like the field it
supports,
is
changing
very
rapidly.
A
consortium
of
industries
and academic laboratories is planned
to support
the project in the
future.
The consortium will entitle its members
to periodic
updates
and
to
influence the direction of new programming undertaken by UWGCG in return for a
pledge of continuing financial support.

Copyrights
UWGCG retains
the copyrights
to all of
its software
and
UWGCG
must
be
contacted
before
all
or
any
part of the its software package
is copied or
transferred to any machine.
UWGCG is, however, mandated
to
provide
research
tools
to help scientists working in the area of molecular genetics and we are
glad to see our source codes become the basis of further
programming
efforts
by
other
scientists.
Copyright
can be removed for any program modified by
more than 25% of its original effort.
Tape Format
The UWGCG package is usually distributed in VAX/VMS "backup" format on
a
9
track
magnetic
tape
recorded
at 1600 bits/inch.
The system consists of
about
1000 files using about 20,000 blocks at 512
bytes/block.
The
current
versions
of
the GenBank and EMBL nucleotide sequence data bases are normally
included which add another 3,000 files and require another 20,000 blocks.
Upon request UWGCG will make a card image tape of all of
the
Fortran 77
programs and procedures
for reading on computers other
than the VAX.
The card
image tape is usually provided at 1600 bits/inch with 80 characters/record and
10
records/block.
Adaptation of UWGCG software
to systems other than VAX/VMS
may take considerable effort.
Equipment Required
UWGCG programs and command procedures will run
on
a
Digital
Equipment
Corporation (DEC) VAX computer that is using version 3.0 or greater of the DEC
VMS operating system.
A tape drive is necessary;
a floating point accelerator
and a DEC Fortran compiler are helpful, but not required.
All programs can be
run from a DEC VT52 or VT100 terminal.
Seven programs,
as noted in
table
1,
require
a
Hewlett
Packard
7221
terminal
plotter wired in series with the
terminal.
Several utilities support a daisy wheel compatible printer attached
to
the terminal's pass-through port, however,
all programs write output files
suitable for printing on any standard device.
