Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in United States
women, accounting for >40,000 deaths each year. These breast
tumors are comprised of phenotypically diverse populations of breast
cancer cells. Using a model in which human breast cancer cells were
grown in immunocompromised mice, we found that only a minority
of breast cancer cells had the ability to form new tumors. We were
able to distinguish the tumorigenic (tumor initiating) from the non-
tumorigenic cancer cells based on cell surface marker expression. We
prospectively identiﬁed and isolated the tumorigenic cells as
CD44CD24/lowLineage in eight of nine patients. As few as 100 cells
with this phenotype were able to form tumors in mice, whereas tens
of thousands of cells with alternate phenotypes failed to form
tumors. The tumorigenic subpopulation could be serially passaged:
each time cells within this population generated new tumors con-
taining additional CD44CD24/lowLineage tumorigenic cells as well
as the phenotypically diverse mixed populations of nontumorigenic
cells present in the initial tumor. The ability to prospectively identify
tumorigenic cancer cells will facilitate the elucidation of pathways
that regulate their growth and survival. Furthermore, because these
cells drive tumor development, strategies designed to target this
population may lead to more effective therapies.
D
espite advances in detection and treatment of metastatic
breast cancer, mortality from this disease remains high
because current therapies are limited by the emergence of
therapy-resistant cancer cells (1, 2). As a result, metastatic breast
cancer remains an incurable disease by current treatment strat-
egies. Cancers are believed to arise from a series of sequential
mutations that occur as a result of genetic instability andor
environmental factors (3, 4). A better understanding of the
consequences of these mutations on the underlying biology of
the neoplastic cells may lead to new therapeutic strategies.
In solid tumors, it has been demonstrated that only a small
proportion of the tumor cells are able to form colonies in an in vitro
clonogenic assay (5–11). Furthermore, large numbers of cells must
typically be transplanted to form tumors in xenograft models. One
possible explanation for these observations is that every cell within
a tumor has the ability to proliferate and form new tumors but that
the probability of an individual cell completing the necessary steps
in these assays is small. An alternative explanation is that only a rare,
phenotypically distinct subset of cells has the capacity to signifi-
cantly proliferate and form new tumors, but that cells within this
subset do so very efficiently (12). To distinguish between these
possibilities, it is necessary to identify the clonogenic cells in these
tumors with markers that distinguish these cells from other non-
tumorigenic cells. This identification has been accomplished in
acute myelogenous leukemia, where it was demonstrated that a
specific subpopulation of leukemia cells (that expressed markers
similar to normal hematopoietic stem cells) was consistently en-
riched for clonogenic activity in nonobese diabeticsevere com-
bined immunodeficient (NODSCID) immunocompromised mice,
whereas other cancer cells were depleted of clonogenic activity
(13–15). Such experiments have not been reported in solid cancers.
If this model were also true for solid tumors, and only a small subset
of cells within a tumor possess the capacity to proliferate and form
new tumors, this finding would have significant implications for
understanding the biology of and developing therapeutic strategies
for these neoplasms.
To investigate the mechanisms of solid tumor heterogeneity, we
developed a modification of the NODSCID mouse model in which
human breast cancers were efficiently propagated in the mouse
mammary fat pad (16). In the present study, we show that solid
tumors contain a distinct population of cells with the exclusive
ability to form tumors in mice. We refer to these cells as tumorigenic
cells, or cancer-initiating cells, because they consistently formed
tumors, whereas other cancer cell populations were depleted of cells
capable of tumor formation. We identified cell surface markers that
can distinguish between these cell populations. Our findings pro-
vide a previously uncharacterized model of breast tumor biology in
which a defined subset of cells drives tumorigenesis, as well as
generating tumor cell heterogeneity. The prospective identification
of this tumorigenic population of cancer cells should allow for the
identification of molecules expressed in these cells that could serve
as targets to eliminate this critical population of cancer cells.
Materials and Methods
Mouse Preparation. Eight-week-old female NODSCID mice
were anesthetized by an i.p. injection of 0.2 ml of ketamine
xylazine (300 mg ketamine combined with 20 mg of xylazine in
a 4-ml volume; 0.02 ml of the solution was used per 20-g mouse).
Dilution to 200 l was done by using Hanks’ balanced salt
solution (HBSS). Mice were then treated with VP-16 (etoposide)
via an i.p. injection (30-mg etoposide dose per 1-kg mouse,
diluted in serum-free HBSS for a final injection volume of 200
l). At the same time, estrogen pellets were placed s.c. on the
back of the mouse’s neck by using a trocar. All tumor injections
implants were done 5 days after this procedure. In the following
procedures, mice were always anesthetized as described above.
Primary Tumor Specimen Implantations. For the implantation of
fresh specimens, samples of human breast tumors were received
within an hour after surgery. The tumors were cut up with scissors
into small pieces, and the pieces were then minced with a blade to
yield 2  2-mm pieces. Mincing was done in sterile RPMI medium
1640 under sterile conditions on ice. The tumor pieces were washed
with serum-free HBSS before implantation. A 2-mm incision was
then made in the mid abdomen area, and by using a trocar, one to
two small tumor pieces were implanted in the region of the upper
right and upper left mammary fat pads (right below the second
nipple on both sides). A 6-0 suture was wrapped twice around the
mammary fat pad nipple, allowing it to hold the implanted pieces
in place. Sutures were removed after 5 days. Nexaban was used to
seal the incision, and mice were monitored weekly for tumor
growth.
Pleural Effusion Injections. For the injection of the pleural effu-
sions, cells were received shortly after thoracentesis and washed

with serum-free HBSS. Cells were then suspended in serum
free-RPMIMatrigel mixture (1:1 volume) and then injected
into the upper right and left mammary pads by using a 22-gauge
needle. An amount equal to 0.2 ml, containing 1–2 million cells,
was typically injected. The site of the needle injection was sealed
with Nexaban to prevent any cell leakage.
Preparation of Single Cell Suspensions of Tumor Cells. Before diges-
tion with collagenase, xenograft tumors or primary human tumors
were cut up into small pieces and then minced completely by using
sterile blades. To obtain single cell suspensions, either pleural
effusion cells or the resulting tumor pieces were then mixed with
ultra-pure collagenase III in medium 199 (200–250 units of colla-
genase per ml) and allowed to incubate at 37°C for 3–4 h. Pipetting
with a 10-ml pipette was done every 15–20 min. At the end of the
incubation, cells were filtered through a 45-l nylon mesh and
washed with RPMI20% FBS, then washed twice with HBSS. Cells
to be injected were then suspended in HBSSMatrigel mix (1:1
volume) and injected into the area of the mammary fat pad as
described above. Nexaban was used to seal the injection site.
Cell Staining for Flow Cytometry. Cells were counted and then
transferred to a 5-ml tube, washed twice with HBSS with 2%
heat-inactivated calf serum (HICS; 5 min at 1,000 rpm), then
resuspended in 100 l (per 106 cells) of HBSS with 2% HICS. Five

Isolation of tumorigenic cells. Flow cytometry was used to isolate
subpopulations of T1 (a and b), T3 (c), T5 (d), T6 (e), and T7 (f) cells that were
tested for tumorigenicity in NODSCID mice. T1 (b) and T3 (c) had been
passaged (P) once in NODSCID mice, whereas the rest of the cells were frozen
or unfrozen samples obtained directly after removal from a patient (UP). Cells
were stained with antibodies against CD44, CD24, Lineage markers, and
mouse-H2K (for passaged tumors obtained from mice), and 7AAD. Dead cells
(7AAD), mouse cells (H2K), and Lineage normal cells were eliminated from
all analyses. Each plot depicts the CD24 and CD44 staining patterns of live
human Lineage cancer cells, and the frequency of the boxed tumorigenic
cancer population as a percentage of cancer cells in each specimen is shown.

Mice were injected with unsorted T1 and T3 cells and a 2-mm piece of T2. Cells from T4–T9 were isolated by
ﬂow cytometry as described in Fig. 1. All nine tumors tested engrafted in our NODSCID mouse model. Except for
T2, which was a primary breast tumor, all other tumors were metastases. All of the tumors were passaged serially
in mice except for T4.

Cells were isolated by ﬂow cytometry as described in Fig. 1 based on
expression of the indicated marker and assayed for the ability to form tumors
after injection into the mammary fat pads of NODSCID mice at 8  105, 5 
105, and 2  105 cells per injection. For 12 wk, mice were examined weekly for
tumors by observation and palpation; then all mice were necropsied to look
for growths at injection sites that were too small to palpate. The number of
tumors that formed and the number of injections that were performed are
indicated for each population. All tumors were readily apparent by visual
inspection and palpation except for tumors from the CD24 population,
which were detected only upon necropsy.

microliters of Sandoglobin solution (1 mgml) was then added and
incubated on ice for 10 min, after which the sample was washed
twice with HBSS2% HICS and resuspended in 100 l (per 106
cells) of HBSS2% HICS. Antibodies (appropriate dilution per
antibody) were then added and incubated for 20 min on ice, and
then washed twice with HBSS2% HICS. When needed, a sec-
ondary antibody addition was conducted by resuspending in 100 l
(per 106 cells) of HBSS2% HICS, and then adding 1–4 l of
secondary antibody (depending on the secondary antibody and its
concentration), followed by a 20-min incubation. When a strepta-
vidin step was used, cells were resuspended in 100 l (per 106 cells)
of HBSS2% HICS, and then 1 l of streptavidin, conjugated with
the indicated fluorescent dye, was added, followed by a 20-min
incubation. The cells were washed twice with HBSS2% HICS and
resuspended in 0.5 ml (per million cells) of HBSS2% HICS
that contained 7-aminoactinomycin D (7AAD, 1 gml final
concentration).
Flow Cytometry. The antibodies used were anti-CD44 [allophyco-
cyanin (APC), phycoerythrin (PE), or biotin], anti-CD24 (PE or
FITC), anti-B38.1 (APC), anti-epithelial-specific antigen (ESA)–
FITC (Biomeda, Foster City, CA), and anti-H2Kd, (PharMingen).
Lineage marker antibodies were anti-CD2, -CD3 -CD10, -CD16,
-CD18, -CD31, -CD64, and -CD140b. Unless noted, antibodies
were purchased from PharMingen. Antibodies were directly con-
jugated to various fluorochromes, depending on the experiment. In
all experiments, mouse cells andor Lineage cells were eliminated
by discarding H2Kd (mouse histocompatibility class I) cells or
Lineage cells during flow cytometry. Dead cells were eliminated
by using the viability dye 7AAD. Flow cytometry was performed on
a FACSVantage (Becton Dickinson). Side scatter and forward
scatter profiles were used to eliminate cell doublets. Cells were
routinely sorted twice, and the cells were reanalyzed for purity,
which typically was 95%.
Results and Discussion
Tumor Specimens and Engraftment Rate. Human breast cancer
specimens obtained from primary or metastatic sites in nine
different patients [designated tumors 1–9 (T1–T9)] all engrafted in
the NODSCID mice (Table 1). In one case, the cancer cells were
obtained from a primary breast tumor (T2) whereas in other cases
the cells were obtained from metastatic pleural effusions (T1 and
T3–T9). Some experiments were conducted on cells after they had
been passaged once or twice in mice (designated passage 1 and 2)
whereas other experiments were conducted on unpassaged fresh or
frozen tumor samples obtained directly from patients. During use
of human cancer cells from tumors passaged in mice, contaminating
mouse cells were removed by eliminating H2K cells (mouse
histocompatibility class I).
Identification of Tumorigenicity Markers. Breast cancer cells were
heterogeneous with respect to expression of a variety of cell surface
markers (including CD44, CD24, and B38.1). CD24 and CD44 are
adhesion molecules whereas B38.1 has been described as a breast
ovarian cancer-specific marker (17–19). To determine whether
these markers could distinguish tumorigenic from nontumorigenic
cells, flow cytometry was used to isolate cells that were positive or
negative for each marker from passage 1 T1 or T2 cells. When 2 
105 to 8  105 cells of each population were injected, all injections
of CD44 cells (88), B38.1 cells (88), or CD24/low cells (1212)
gave rise to visible tumors within 12 wk of injection, but none of the
CD44 cell (08), or B38.1 cell (08) injections formed detectable
tumors (Table 2). Although no tumors could be detected by
palpation in the locations injected with CD24 cells, 2 of 12 mice
injected with CD24 cells did contain small growths at the injection
site that were detected on necropsy. These growths most likely arose
from the 1–3% of CD24 cells that invariably contaminate the
sorted CD24 cells or alternatively from CD24 cells with reduced
proliferative capacity (Table 2). Because the CD44 cells were
exclusively B38.1, we focused on the CD44 and CD24 markers in
subsequent experiments.
Several antigens associated with normal cell types (Lineage
markers: CD2, CD3, CD10, CD16, CD18, CD31, CD64, and
CD140b) were found not to be expressed by the cancer cells
based on analyses of tumors that had been passaged multiple
times in mice. By eliminating Lineage cells from unpassaged or

Cells were isolated from passage 1 (Mouse passage 1) T1, T2, and T3, passage 2 (Mouse passage 2) T3, and unpassaged (Patients’ tumor cells) T1, T4, T5, T6,
T8, and T9. CD44CD24Lineage populations and CD44CD24/lowLineage cells were isolated by ﬂow cytometry as described in Fig. 1. The indicated number
of cells of each phenotype was injected into the breast of NODSCID mice. The frequency of tumorigenic cells calculated by the modiﬁed maximum likelihood
analysis method is 5105 if single tumorigenic cells were capable of forming tumors, and every transplanted tumorigenic cell gave rise to a tumor (33). Therefore,
this calculation may underestimate the frequency of the tumorigenic cells because it does not take into account cell–cell interactions and local environmental
factors that may inﬂuence engraftment. In addition to the markers that are shown, all sorted cells in all experiments were Lineage, and the tumorigenic cells
from T1, T2, and T3 were further selected as B38.1. The mice were observed weekly for 4–6.5 mo, or until the mice became sick from the tumors.
*Two thousand cells were injected in these experiments.
†Tumor formation by 5,000 T5 ESACD44CD24/lowLineage cells was detected 8–9 wk after injections, whereas tumor formation by 5,000 T5
ESACD44CD24/lowLineage cells was detected 10–12 wk after injections.

early passage tumor cells, normal human leukocytes, endothelial
cells, mesothelial cells, and fibroblasts were eliminated. By
microscopic examination, the Lineage tumor cells consistently
had the appearance of neoplastic cells (data not shown).
Depending on the tumor, 11–35% of the Lineage cancer cells
in tumors or pleural effusions were CD44CD24/low (Fig. 1).
CD44CD24/lowLineage cells or other populations of Lineage
cancer cells that had been isolated from nine patients were injected
into the mammary fat pads of mice (Table 3). When injecting
unsorted, passaged T1 or T2 cells, 5  104 cells consistently gave rise
to tumors, but 104 cells gave rise to tumors in only a minority of
cases. In contrast, as few as 103 T1 or T2 CD44CD24/lowLineage
cells gave rise to tumors in all cases (Table 3). In T1 and T2, up to
2  104 cells that were CD44Lineage but CD24 failed to form
tumors. These data suggest that the CD44CD24/lowLineage
population is 10- to 50-fold enriched for the ability to form tumors
in NODSCID mice relative to unfractionated tumor cells.
Whether the CD44CD24/lowLineage cells were isolated from
passaged tumors (T1, T2, and T3) or from unpassaged cancer cells
obtained directly from patients (T1, T4–T6, T8, and T9), they were
enriched for tumorigenic activity. Note that T7 was the only one of
nine cancers studied that did not fit this pattern (Fig. 1f). Other than
T7, CD24Lineage cancer cells in both unpassaged and passaged
tumors were unable to form new tumors (Table 3). Therefore, the
xenograft and unpassaged patient tumors were composed of similar
populations of phenotypically diverse cancer cell types, and in both
cases only the CD44CD24/lowLineage cells had the capacity to
proliferate to form new tumors (P  0.001).
In three of the tumors, further enrichment of tumorigenic
activity was possible by isolating the ESA subset of the
CD44CD24/low population. ESA has been used in the past to
distinguish epithelial cancer cells from benign reactive mesothe-
lial cells (20). When ESACD44CD24/low Lineage cells were
isolated from passaged T1, as few as 200 cells consistently
formed tumors of 1 cm between 5 and 6 mo after injection,
whereas 2,000 ESACD44CD24/lowLineage cells or 20,000
CD44CD24 cells always failed to form tumors (Table 3). Ten
thousand unsorted cells formed tumors in only 3 of 12 mice. This
result suggests that the ESACD44CD24/low Lineage pop-
ulation was 50-fold enriched for the ability to form tumors
relative to unfractionated tumor cells (Table 3). The
ESACD44CD24/lowLineage population accounted for
2–4% of passage 1 T1 cells (2.5–5% of cancer cells). The
ESACD44CD24/lowLineage population (0.6% of cancer
cells) from unpassaged T5 cells was also enriched for tumori-
genic activity, compared with ESACD44CD24/low Lineage
cells, but both the ESA and ESA fractions had some tumor-
igenic activity (Table 3). Among unpassaged T5 cells, as few as
1,000 ESACD44CD24/lowLineage cells consistently formed
tumors.
To determine whether the difference in tumorigenicity of the
cell populations was due to differences in cell cycle, we analyzed
these populations by flow cytometry. Comparison of the cell
cycle status of tumorigenic and nontumorigenic cancer cells
from T1 revealed that both exhibited a similar cell cycle distri-
bution (Fig. 2). Therefore, neither population was enriched for

and the remaining Lineage nontumorigenic cancer cells (b) isolated from

tumorigenic and nontumorigenic cell populations exhibited similar cell cycle
distributions.

cells at a particular stage of the cell cycle, and the nontumori-
genic cells were able to undergo at least a limited number of
divisions in the xenograft model.
Six months after injection, the injection sites of 20,000 tumori-
genic CD44CD24/lowLineage cells and 20,000 nontumorigenic
CD44CD24Lineage cells were examined by histology. The
CD44CD24/lowLineage injection sites contained tumors 1 cm
in diameter, whereas the CD44CD24Lineage injection sites
contained no detectable tumors (Fig. 3c). Only normal mouse
mammary tissue was seen by histology at the sites of the
CD44CD24Lineage injections (Fig. 3a), whereas the tumors
formed by CD44CD24/lowLineage cells contained malignant
cells as judged by hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections (Fig. 3b).
Even when CD44CD24Lineage injection sites from 58 mice
(each administered 1,000–50,000 cells) were examined after 16–29
wk, no tumors were detected. Furthermore, the tumorigenic and
nontumorigenic populations were indistinguishable morphologi-
cally. Both the tumorigenic and nontumorigenic subsets of Lin-
eage cells from passaged and unpassaged tumors contained
95% cancer cells as judged by Wright staining or Papanicolaou
staining and microscopic analysis. By histology, the CD44CD24/low
Lineage cells and the rest of the Lineage cells had the
appearances of epithelial cancer cells (Fig. 3 d and e).
The Tumorigenic Population Is Capable of Generating the Phenotypic
Heterogeneity Found in the Initial Tumor. The ability of small
numbers of CD44CD24/lowLineage tumorigenic cells to give
rise to new tumors was reminiscent of the organogenic capacity of
normal stem cells. Normal stem cells self-renew and give rise to
phenotypically diverse cells with reduced proliferative potential. To
test whether tumorigenic breast cancer cells also exhibit these
properties, tumors arising from 200 ESACD44CD24/low
Lineage T1 or 1,000 CD44CD24/lowLineage T2 cells were
dissociated and analyzed by flow cytometry. The heterogeneous
expression patterns of ESA, CD44, or CD24 in the secondary
tumors resembled the phenotypic complexity of the tumors from
which they were derived (Fig. 4 a and b vs. e and f). Within these
secondary tumors, the CD44CD24/lowLineage cells remained
tumorigenic, whereas other populations of Lineage cancer cells
remained nontumorigenic (Table 3). Thus, tumorigenic cells gave
rise to both additional CD44CD24/lowLineage tumorigenic cells
as well as to phenotypically diverse nontumorigenic cells that
recapitulated the complexity of the primary tumors from which the
tumorigenic cells had been derived. These CD44CD24/low
Lineage tumorigenic cells from T1, T2, and T3 have now been
serially passaged through four rounds of tumor formation in mice,
yielding similar results in each passage with no evidence of de-
creased tumorigeneity (data not shown). These observations sug-
gest that CD44CD24/lowLineage tumorigenic cancer cells un-
dergo processes analogous to the self-renewal and differentiation of
normal stem cells.
Our results demonstrate that heterogeneous populations of cells
in breast cancers consist of a phenotypically distinct tumorigenic
population, as well as a much larger population that lacks this
tumorigenic potential. It is known that breast cancer cells are
genetically unstable, and thus individual breast cancer cells from the
tumorigenic population may sometimes be unable to proliferate as
a consequence of chromosomal aberrations acquired during mitosis
(21–23). Nevertheless, the observation that in eight of nine tumor
specimens the tumorigenic subpopulation displayed a common
phenotype that allowed for their identification suggests that com-
mon pathways may drive this tumorigenic population.
The tumorigenic CD44CD24/lowLineage population shares
with normal stem cells the ability to proliferate extensively, and to

Lineage cancer cells from T1 (a, c, and e) or T2 (b, d, and f). T1 CD44Lineage cells (a) or T2 Lineage cells (b) were obtained from tumors that had been passaged
once in NODSCID mice. ESACD44CD24/lowLineage tumorigenic cells from T1 (c) or CD44CD24/lowLineage tumorigenic cells from T2 (d) were isolated and
injected into the breasts of NODSCID mice; e and f depict analyses of the tumors that arose from these cells. In both cases, the tumorigenic cells formed tumors
that contained phenotypically diverse cells similar to those observed in the original tumor.

give rise to diverse cell types with reduced developmental or
proliferative potential (24). The extensive proliferative potential of
the tumorigenic population was demonstrated by the ability of as
few as 200 passaged or 1,000 unpassaged ESACD44CD24/low
Lineage cells to give rise to tumors (1 cm in diameter) that could
be serially transplanted in NODSCID mice. The tumorigenic
population from T1, T2, and T3 has now been purified and serially
passaged four times through NODSCID mice. This extensive
proliferative potential contrasts with the bulk of CD44 andor
CD24 cancer cells that lacked the ability to form detectable
tumors. Not only was the CD44CD24/lowLineage population of
cells able to give rise to additional tumorigenic CD44CD24/low
Lineage cells, but they were also able to give rise to phenotypically
diverse nontumorigenic cells that composed the bulk of the tumors.
This result was the case even after two rounds of serial passaging.
Thus, CD44CD24/lowLineage cells from most tumors seem to
exhibit properties of cancer stem cells. Unequivocal demonstration
of the stem cell capacity of these cells will require development of
model systems capable of tumor generation from a single cell (25).
Nonetheless, our results demonstrate that there is a hierarchy of
breast cancer cells in which some cells have the ability to proliferate
extensively, whereas the majority of tumor cells that can be derived
from this population have only limited proliferative potential in
vivo. It has previously been shown that the phenotype of acute
myelogenous leukemia leukemogenic cells is similar to that of early
hematopoietic progenitor stem cells (14). Our results suggest that
this result may also be true for tumorigenic breast cancer cells,
because early multipotent epithelial progenitor cells also have been
reported to express ESA and CD44 (26–28).
The ability to separate tumorigenic and nontumorigenic popu-
lations of tumor cells should allow the molecular characterization
of these cells and elucidation of the pathways that account for their
tumorigenic potential. Furthermore, the existence of a subset of
tumorigenic cells within a tumor would provide an explanation for
a number of clinical observations in breast cancer patients. For
instance, it has been demonstrated that up to 30% of breast cancer
patients may show micrometastatic disease in their bone marrow at
the time of presentation. However, after 5 yr, only 50% of these
patients will demonstrate clinically evident metastases. This finding
has been speculated to be due to tumor dormancy. However, an
alternative explanation consistent with a cancer stem cell model is
that cancer cells in the bone marrow of patients may arise from the
spread of either tumorigenic or nontumorigenic cancer cells, and
only when tumorigenic cells metastasize will frank tumors that are
clinically significant develop. This second explanation suggests that
the development of diagnostic reagents that allow for the prospec-
tive identification of tumorigenic cells may have prognostic signif-
icance for patients with breast cancer.
The identification of tumorigenic and nontumorigenic breast
cancer cells also has important therapeutic implications. Tradition-
ally, drug therapies have been developed based on the ability of
these agents to cause tumor regression in animal models. Because
we have shown that the majority of cancer cells within a tumor are
nontumorigenic, therapies directed at these cells would cause tumor
regression. However, if therapies fail to target the tumorigenic cells,
then these cells would persist after therapy and be able to regen-
erate the tumor, resulting in tumor relapse. It is known that normal
stem cells have mechanisms that make them relatively resistant to
chemotherapy, such as increased expression of BCL-2 family pro-
teins, increased expression of membrane transporters like breast
cancer drug resistance protein, and multiple drug resistance (29–
32). The expression of such proteins in tumorigenic breast cancer
cells may make them inherently more resistant to current therapies.
The prospective identification of the tumorigenic population of
cancer cells should allow the identification of molecules expressed
in these cells that could be targeted to eliminate this crucial
population of cancer cells, leading to more effective cancer
therapies.
