editor, visualization, and analysis platform

Abstract
Background: The Avogadro project has developed an advanced molecule editor and visualizer designed for
cross-platform use in computational chemistry, molecular modeling, bioinformatics, materials science, and related
areas. It oﬀers ﬂexible, high quality rendering, and a powerful plugin architecture. Typical uses include building
molecular structures, formatting input ﬁles, and analyzing output of a wide variety of computational chemistry
packages. By using the CML ﬁle format as its native document type, Avogadro seeks to enhance the semantic
accessibility of chemical data types.
Results: The work presented here details the Avogadro library, which is a framework providing a code library and
application programming interface (API) with three-dimensional visualization capabilities; and has direct applications
to research and education in the ﬁelds of chemistry, physics, materials science, and biology. The Avogadro application
provides a rich graphical interface using dynamically loaded plugins through the library itself. The application and
library can each be extended by implementing a plugin module in C++ or Python to explore diﬀerent visualization
techniques, build/manipulate molecular structures, and interact with other programs. We describe some example
extensions, one which uses a genetic algorithm to ﬁnd stable crystal structures, and one which interfaces with the
PackMol program to create packed, solvated structures for molecular dynamics simulations. The 1.0 release series of
Avogadro is the main focus of the results discussed here.
Conclusions: Avogadro oﬀers a semantic chemical builder and platform for visualization and analysis. For users, it
oﬀers an easy-to-use builder, integrated support for downloading from common databases such as PubChem and the
Protein Data Bank, extracting chemical data from a wide variety of formats, including computational chemistry output,
and native, semantic support for the CML ﬁle format. For developers, it can be easily extended via a powerful plugin
mechanism to support new features in organic chemistry, inorganic complexes, drug design, materials, biomolecules,
and simulations. Avogadro is freely available under an open-source license from http://avogadro.openmolecules.net.
Background
Many ﬁelds such as chemistry, materials science, physics,
and biology, need eﬃcient computer programs to both
build and visualize molecular structures. The ﬁeld of
molecular graphics is dominated by viewers with lit-
tle or no editing capabilities, such as RasMol [1], Jmol
[2], PyMOL [3], VMD [4], QuteMol [5], BALLView [6],
VESTA [7], and XCrySDen [8,9], among many others. The

aforementioned viewers are all freely available, and most
of them are available under open-source licenses and work
on the most common operating systems (Linux, Apple
Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows, and BSD).
The choice of software capable of building chemical
structures in three dimensions is far smaller. There are
existing commercial packages, such as CAChe/Scigress
[10], ChemBio3D [11], GaussView [12], HyperChem [13],
CrystalMaker [14], Materials Studio [15], and Spartan
[16], which are polished and capable of constructing many
diﬀerent types of molecular structures. They are, however,
not available for all operating systems (most of them only
run on Microsoft Windows), and are not easily extensi-
ble, customized, or integrated into automated workﬂows.

Licensing costs can be prohibitive. If the company were to
change its direction or focus, this can lead to a loss of a
signiﬁcant research investment in a commercial product.
Furthermore, in most cases, these programs use custom,
proprietary ﬁle formats, and semantic and chemical data
can be lost in conversion to other data formats.
The selection of free, open-source, cross-platform,
three-dimensional, molecular builders was quite limited
when the Avogadro project was founded in late 2006.
Ghemical [17] was one of the only projects satisfying these
needs at the time. Two of the authors (Hutchison and
Curtis) contributed to Ghemical previously, but had found
that it was not easily extensible. This led them to found
a new project to address the issues they had observed in
Ghemical and other packages. The Molden [18] applica-
tion was also available, able to build up small molecules
and analyze output from several quantum codes. How-
ever, it suﬀers from a restrictive license and it uses an
antiquated graphical toolkit, which is not native on most
modern operating systems.
Broad goals for the design of a molecular editor were
identiﬁed following a case study of the available appli-
cations. One of the main issues with both commercial
and open-source applications is a lack of extensibility;
many of the applications also only work on one or two
operating systems. The creation of an open and exten-
sible framework that implements many of the necessary
foundations for a molecular builder and visualizer would
facilitate more eﬀective research in this area. Further, the
open, standardized Chemical Markup Language (CML)
ﬁle format [19,20] would be used, to secure semantic and
chemical data and allow easy interoperability with other
chemistry software.
At the time of writing, it is apparent that other
researchers have perceived similar needs. Several new
applications are available today that focus on both build-
ing and visualizing molecular structure. These include
CCP1GUI [21], Gabedit [22] and some highly speciﬁc edi-
tors such as MacMolPlt [23] which focus on particular
computational packages (i.e., GAMESS-US for MacMol-
Plt). Whilst oﬀering many interesting and useful fea-
tures, these projects suﬀer from the same issues centering
around eﬀective reuse of existing code, well commented
and documented code, and easy extension to add new
features and adapt for specialized areas.
Implementation
The Avogadro project was started in earnest in 2007, and
over the ﬁrst 5 years of development has been downloaded
over 270,000 times [24], been translated into over 20 lan-
guages [25], and has over 20 contributors [26]. So far, it
has been cited over 100 times [27], including applications
in spectroscopy, catalysis, materials chemistry, theoretical
chemistry, biochemistry, and molecular dynamics, among
many others [28-47].
From the beginning, the project has strived to make a
robust, ﬂexible framework for both building and visual-
izing molecular structures. Much of the initial focus has
been placed on preparing input and analyzing output from
quantum calculations. Other applications such as prepar-
ing input for MD simulations and visualizing periodic
structures will also be presented, demonstrating the ﬂex-
ibility of the Avogadro platform. The development team
has also been members of the Blue Obelisk movement, fol-
lowing the three pillars outlined by the group: Open Data,
Open Standards, and Open Source [48,49].
Software architecture
One area that seems to suﬀer in many code bases in
chemistry is software architecture. This can lead to less
maintainable code, poor code reuse, and a much higher
barrier to entry. Problems were identiﬁed in other projects
with a view to minimize their impact when developing
Avogadro. Modern software design processes were used
in the initial planning stages of Avogadro, along with the
choice of modern programming languages and libraries.
Avogadro has close ties to several other free, cross-
platform, open-source projects to reuse as much code
as is practical. These projects include Qt [50] to pro-
vide a free, cross-platform graphical toolkit; Open Babel
[51] for chemical ﬁle input/output, geometry optimiza-
tion, and other chemical perception; Eigen [52] for matrix
and vector mathematics; OpenGL/GLSL for real-time,
three-dimensional rendering; and POV-Ray for ray-traced
rendering.
Based on the previous experience of the authors and
a review of available programs at the time, several fun-
damental choices were made. The C++ programming
language; the Qt graphical toolkit; OpenGL for 3D visu-
alization; CMake as the build system; and Open Babel as
the chemical library. Using this combination of languages
and libraries requires the project to be licensed under the
GNU GPLv2 [53] license and made openly available to all.
The core of Avogadro is written in portable C++ code
with platform-speciﬁc diﬀerences abstracted away by Qt,
OpenGL, and Open Babel. The CMake build system
makes the build process relatively simple on all supported
platforms. Avogadro has been successfully built and tested
on Linux, Apple Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows in
common 32 and 64 bit hardware architectures.
The Avogadro framework uses the model, view, con-
troller paradigm. The model is comprised of the core data
classes such as Molecule, Atom, and Bond, views are
made up of the engine/display plugins, and controllers
are the tools (interactive mouse) and extensions (non-
interactive, form based/menu based). Every plugin has full
access to the core data model, but view and controller

http://www.jcheminf.com/content/4/1/17
plugins are conceptually diﬀerent; views are responsible
for displaying data and controllers are responsible for
modifying/changing data.
Plugins rely on Avogadro’s set of programming inter-
faces and almost all functionality is implemented in self
contained plugins that are loaded at runtime. The major-
ity of plugins distributed with Avogadro are written in
C++, but the API is also available in the Python script-
ing language. This allows for a great deal of choice in how
plugins are implemented. Each plugin is a singleton class
that implements a particular set of functions–depending
on the type of plugin–which allows for features to be
implemented in a very modular way.
Over the last few years Avogadro development has
started to use nightly builds of the latest version of the
code in order to automatically ﬂag issues introduced in
new commits. Code review was also introduced in order
to add a review step before new code is merged, along with
softening the line between someone with commit rights
and someone without (anyone can propose and upload a
patch, but a small group can choose if/when the patch will
be merged). Some automated testing has been added, but
coverage at this point remains relatively low. API docu-
mentation is automatically generated from comments in
the code using Doxygen.
Plugin interface
Avogadro plugins are divided into four diﬀerent types
corresponding to four main classes that derive from this
common base class, specializing their interface for speciﬁc
activities (Figure 1). The Avogadro::Color base class
deﬁnes the virtual interface for applying colors to atoms,
bonds,
and
other
properties.
Avogadro::Engine
deﬁnes the common interface for all display types
in Avogadro: simple ball and stick, Van der Waals
visualizations, surfaces, and force visualizations. The
Avogadro::Tool base class provides the interface for
all interactive tools, focusing principally on mouse and
keyboard interaction with Avogadro. Examples of tool
plugins include the draw tool used to draw molecules
atom by atom, and the navigation tool used to pan, rotate,
and scale the view of the molecule. There are also several
specialized tools such as the alignment tool.
Finally there is the Avogadro::Extension class,
which deﬁnes the interface for dialog based plugins.
These extensions can interact with the molecule, and
are used for a variety of purposes from molecule prop-
erties dialogs to input ﬁle generation dialogs for many
quantum codes including NWChem, Gaussian, GAMESS,
and others. This class of plugin is also applied to
ﬁle import, and network aware extensions querying
web databases for structures given their common name
for example.
At start up, several standard directories, which may
be customized, are searched for plugins. The Qt plugin
framework is used to check that the plugins have a recent
enough version to be loaded, and the plugin type can be
deduced once loaded. The user interface is then populated
with appropriate entries; tools are added to the main tool-
bar using their embedded icons, display types are added

to the display type list, and menu entries are added for all
loaded extensions.
The tool and display type plugins can both (option-
ally) provide a dialog for conﬁguring the plugin. Dialogs
are speciﬁc to each plugin and integrated into the user
interface.
Display types
Display plugins are referred to as “engines” internally.
Their primary focus is rendering graphics to the screen.
As is the case with most molecular graphics, a large por-
tion of the geometric primitives are spheres and cylinders,
typically used to represent atoms and bonds. There are
many other properties that can be rendered using the dis-
play type plugins, for example, some of the engines also
convey information about the underlying data the geomet-
ric primitives represent to allow for the molecule to be
edited. Table 1 shows a summary of the display plugins
distributed with Avogadro.
Engines are performance critical as the render functions
are called each time a frame is requested for display. Eﬃ-
cient rendering is also critical since multiple display types

light all rings in the structure. Figure 2 (d) and (f) show
two such combinations of multiple display types.
Tools
The tools are responsible for virtually all mouse and key-
board interaction with the molecule. A list of all tools is
given in Table 2.
The navigation tool provides basic scene navigation,
implementing rotation,panning, tilting, and zooming sup-
port. The initial point of interaction (where the click
occurs) changes the anchor point for navigation; navi-
gation takes place about the center of molecule when
clicking in empty space or about the center of any clicked
atom. During interaction, the navigation tool provides
visual cues to show what type of navigation is taking place.
The navigation tool is also used as the default tool if the
currently active tool does not handle the mouse event
passed to it.
One of the other central tools is the draw tool, which
implements a free-hand molecule drawing input method
supporting keyboard shortcuts, combo boxes, and a peri-
odic table view to select elements. The user can use the left
mouse button to add new atoms or bonds, or click on the
bonds to change their order. The right mouse button can
be used to delete atoms or bonds, and the directional keys
can be used in combination with the mouse to quickly
rotate/pan the molecule.
There are also two tools for adjustment of structures
(atom or bond centric), a selection tool supporting stan-
dard selection interactions, and an auto-rotate tool that
allows users to set the speed and angles about which
to rotate the molecule. The interactive auto-optimization
tool provides a sculpting interaction, where the user can
begin a continuous geometry optimization and switch
back to the draw or adjustment tools and change the shape
and structure of the molecule while observing the new
structure being optimized. This can also be combined
with the measurement tool to interactively observe bond
lengths and angles evolve as the structure is updated and
the geometry minimized. If the optimization tool is turned
oﬀ, the measurement tool also allows the user to precisely
adjust bond lengths and/or angles using the adjustment
tools.
Extensions
Extensions represent quite a diverse range of plugins
including input generation dialogs for various quantum
chemistry codes such as GAMESS, Molpro, NWChem,
etc., animation of the molecule, and visualization of
molecular orbitals and electron density. Network aware
extensions allow the user to click on a menu item to fetch

extensions distributed with Avogadro is shown in Table 3.
Other extensions translate the entire scene to POV-
Ray input, and call POV-Ray to render the molecule
using ray tracing techniques to provide higher quality
renderings for publication. Various molecular property
dialogs are also implemented as plugins, drawing largely
on Open Babel functionality to provide an overview of
the molecule. Cartesian editors, addition and removal
of hydrogens, fragment, SMILES, and peptide insertion

are all implemented as extensions showing up in Avo-

was added, giving access to a much wider range to func-
tionality useful to practitioners in that area, including
Miller Plane visualization, slab and surface generation.
New builders for nanotubes, nanoparticles, and DNA are
also planned for upcoming releases.
Colors
The color plugins primarily take either double precision
numbers or integer values and return an RGB value.
The plugins range from the standard color plugin that
takes atomic number and returns the standard RGB value
for that element through to mapping things like partial
change and index to more easily view various aspects of
the molecule’s structure.
By deﬁning a plugin interface for coloring atoms, bonds,
or residues, developers can easily oﬀer ﬂexible render-
ing options to highlight important information without
requiring a user to tediously set colors on speciﬁc atoms
or functional groups. Default color plugins are listed in
Table 4, illustrating the variety of options. Each plugin is
usually only 40-50 lines of C++ code.
Python scripting
Python bindings are provided for all of the core API.
Python code can be used in two ways: the ﬁrst is the inter-
active Python terminal, and the second is to write Python
plugins; extensions, tools, or display types. Writing a

Python plugin requires the same functionality to be imple-
mented as a native C++ plugin [55]. The advantage of
Python plugins is that it’s easier to make prototypes since
no compilation is required. Python plugins can also easily
be shared with other users.
The Python bindings interface with the PyQt python
bindings for the Qt toolkit, which enables Python code to
use all of Qt’s features when writing a plugin. For example,
a short Python script can present a window using Qt and
render molecules using Avogadro [56-58].
Avogadro also includes an interactive Python console
(Figure 3, which allows users to directly script and manip-
ulate the Avogadro environment [59].
Results and discussion
The graphical user interface
The ﬁrst thing most people will see is the main Avo-
gadro application window, as shown in Figure 4. Binary
installers are provided for Apple Mac OS X and Microsoft
Windows, along with packages for all of the major Linux
distributions. This means that Avogadro can be installed
quite easily on most operating systems. Easy to follow
instructions on how to compile the latest source code are
also provided on the main Avogadro web site [60,61] for
the more adventurous, or those using an operating system
that is not yet supported.
The Qt toolkit gives Avogadro a native look and feel
on the three major supported operating systems—Linux,
Apple Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows. The basic
functionality expected in a molecular builder and viewer
has been implemented, along with several less common
features. It is very easy for new users to install Avogadro
and build their ﬁrst molecules within minutes. Thanks to
the Open Babel library [51], Avogadro supports a large
portion of the chemical ﬁle formats that are in common
use. The vast majority of this functionality has been writ-
ten using the interface made available to plugin writers,
and is loaded at runtime. We will discuss these plugin
interfaces and descriptions of the plugin types later.
Semantic chemistry
Avogadro has used CML [19,20] as its default ﬁle format
from a very early stage; this was chosen over other ﬁle
formats because of the extensible, semantic structure pro-
vided by CML, and the support available in Open Babel
[51]. The CML format oﬀers a number of advantages over
others in common use, including the ability to extend the
format. This allows Avogadro and other programs to be
future-proof, adding new information and features neces-
sary for an advanced semantically-aware editor at a later
time, while still remaining readable in older versions of
Avogadro.
Through the use of Open Babel [51], a large array of
ﬁle formats can be interpreted. When extending Avogadro
to read in larger amounts of the output from quantum
codes, it was necessary to devote signiﬁcant develop-
ment resources to understanding and adding semantic
meaning to the quantum code output. This work was
developed in a plugin, which was later split out into

a small independent library called OpenQube [62,63].
More recently a large amount of work has been done
by the Quixote project [64], JUMBO-Converters, and the
Semantic Physical Science workshop to augment quantum
codes to output more of this data directly from the code.
Since CML can be extended, it is possible to reuse exist-
ing conventions for molecular structure data, and add new
conventions for the additional quantum data.
Building a molecule: atom by atom
After opening Avogadro a window such as that shown in
Figure 4 is presented. By default, the draw tool is selected.
Simply left-clicking on the black part of the display allows
the user to draw a carbon atom. If the user pushes the left
mouse button down and drags, a bonded carbon atom is
drawn between the start point and the ﬁnal position where
the mouse is released.
A large amount of eﬀort has been expended to create
an intuitive tool for drawing small molecules. Common
chemical elements can be selected from a drop down list,
or a periodic table can be displayed to select less com-
mon elements. Clicking on an existing atom changes it
to the currently selected element, dragging changes the
atom back to its previous element and draws a new atom

bonded to the original. If the bonds are left-clicked then
the bond order cycles between single, double, and triple.
Shortcut keys are also available, e.g., typing the atomic
symbol (e.g., “C-o” for cobalt) changes the selected ele-
ment, or typing the numbers “1,” “2,” and “3” changes the
bond order.
Right clicking on atoms or bonds deletes them. If the
“Adjust Hydrogens” box is checked, the number of hydro-
gens bonded to each atom is automatically adjusted to
satisfy valency. Alternatively, this can also be done at the
end of an editing session by using the “Add hydrogens”
extension in the build menu.
In addition to the draw tool, there are two tools for
adjusting the position of atoms in existing molecules. The
“atom centric manipulate” tool can be used to move an
atom or a group of selected atoms. The “bond centric
manipulate” tool can be used to select a bond, and then
adjust all atoms positions relative to the selected bond in
various ways (e.g., altering the bond length, bond angles,
or dihedral angles). These three tools allow for a great
deal of ﬂexibility in building small molecules interactively
on screen.
Once the molecular structure is complete, the force
ﬁeld extension can be used to perform a geometry opti-
mization. By clicking on “Extensions” and “Optimize
Geometry” a fast geometry optimization is performed on
the molecule. The force ﬁeld and calculation parameters
can be adjusted, but the defaults are adequate for most
molecules. This workﬂow is typical when building up a
small molecular structures for use as input to quantum
calculations, or publication quality ﬁgures.
An alternative is to combine the “Auto Optimization”
tool with the drawing tool. This presents a unique way of
sculpting the molecule while the geometry is constantly
minimized in the background. The geometry optimiza-
tion is animated, and the eﬀect of changing bond orders,
adding new groups, or removing groups can be observed
interactively.
Several dialogs are implemented to provide information
on molecule properties and to precisely change parame-
ters, such as the cartesian coordinates of the atoms in the
molecule.
Building a molecule: from fragments
In addition to building molecules atom-by-atom, users
can insert pre-built fragments of common molecules,
ligands, or amino-acid sequences, as shown in Figure 5. In
all cases, after inserting the fragment, the atom-centered
manipulate tool is selected, allowing the fragment to be
moved or rotated into position easily.
Users can also insert a SMILES [65,66] string for a
molecule. In this case, a rough 3D geometry is generated
using Open Babel and a quick force ﬁeld optimization.
Preparing input for quantum codes
Several extensions were developed for Avogadro that
assist the user in preparing input ﬁles for popular
quantum codes such as GAMESS-US, [67] NWChem,
[68] Gaussian, [69] Q-Chem, [70] Molpro, [71] and
MOPAC200x [72]. The graphical dialogs present the fea-
tures required to run basic quantum calculations; some
examples are shown in Figure 6.
The preview of the input ﬁle at the bottom of each
dialog is updated as options are changed. This approach
helps new users of quantum codes to learn the syntax of
input ﬁles for diﬀerent codes, and to quickly generate use-
ful input ﬁles as they learn. The input can also be edited
by hand in the dialog before the ﬁle is saved and sub-
mitted to the quantum code. The MOPAC extension can
also run the MOPAC200x program directly if it is avail-
able on the user’s computer, and then reload the output

ﬁle into Avogadro once the calculation is complete. This
feature will be extended to other quantum codes in future
versions of Avogadro.
The GAMESS-US plugin is one of the most highly
developed, featuring a basic dialog present in most of the
other input deck generators, as well as an advanced dialog
exposing many of the more unusual and complex calcula-
tion types. In addition to the advanced dialog, the input
deck can be edited inline and features syntax highlight-
ing (Figure 7) as used in many popular editors aimed
at software developers. This can indicate simple typing
errors in keywords, as well as harder to spot whitespace
errors that would otherwise cause the hand-edited input
deck to fail when being read by GAMESS-US.
Alignment and measurements
One of the specialized tools included in the standard Avo-
gadro distribution is the alignment tool. This mouse tool
facilitates the alignment of a molecular structure with
the coordinate origin if one atom is selected, and along
the speciﬁed axis if two atoms are selected. The align-
ment tool can be combined with the measure, select,
and manipulate tools to create inputs for quantum codes
where the position and orientation of the molecule is
important. One example of this is calculations where an
external electric ﬁeld is applied to the molecule. In these
types of calculations, the alignment of the molecule can
have a large eﬀect. Figure 8 shows the measurement tool in
action with the alignment tool conﬁguration dialog visible
in the lower-left corner.
More complex alignment tools for speciﬁc tasks could
be created. The alignment tool was created in just a few
hours for a speciﬁc research project. This is a prime exam-
ple where extensibility was very important for performing
research using a graphical computational chemistry tool.
It would not be worth the investment to create a new
application just to align molecular structures to an axis,
but creating a plugin for an extensible project is not
unreasonable.

Visualization
The Avogadro application uses OpenGL to render molec-
ular representations to the screen interactively. OpenGL
oﬀers a high-level, cross-platform API for rendering
three-dimensional images using hardware accelerated
graphics. OpenGL 1.1 and below is used in most of the
rendering code, and so Avogadro can be used even on
older computer systems, or those without more modern
accelerated graphics. It is capable of taking advantage of
some of the newer features available in OpenGL 2.0 as
described below, but this has been kept as an optional
extra feature when working on novel visualizations of
molecular structure.
Standard representations
In chemistry, there are several standard representations of
molecular structure, originally based upon those possible
with physical models. The Avogadro application imple-
ments each of these representations shown in Figure 2 as
a plugin. These range from the simple wireframe repre-
sentation, stick/licorice, ball and stick, and Van der Waals
spheres.
It is also possible to combine several representations,
such as ball and stick with ring rendering (Figure 2 (d)),
and a semi-transparent Van der Waals space-ﬁlling repre-
sentation with a stick representation to elucidate molecu-
lar backbone (Figure 2 (f)).
Quantum calculations and electronic structure
Quantum codes were originally developed for line print-
ers, and unfortunately little has changed since then in the
standard log ﬁles. There are several formats developed for
use in other codes and speciﬁcally for visualization and
analysis, but there is little agreement on any standard ﬁle
format in the computational quantum chemistry commu-
nity. A plugin was developed in Avogadro to visualize the
output of various quantum codes, and get the data into the
right format for further visualization and analysis.
Initially support was added and extended in Open Babel
for Gaussian cube ﬁles. This format provides atomic coor-
dinates and one or more regularly spaced grids of scalar
values. This can be read in, and techniques such as the
marching cubes algorithm can be used to compute trian-
gular meshes of isosurfaces at values of electron density
for example. Once the code has been developed to visu-
alize these isosurfaces, it became clear that it would be
useful to be able to calculate these cubes on the ﬂy, and at
diﬀerent levels of detail depending upon the intended use.
The ﬁrst format, which was somewhat documented at
the time it was developed, is the Gaussian formatted
checkpoint format. This format is much easier to parse
than the log ﬁles generated as the program runs, and
provides all of the detail needed to calculate scalar val-
ues of the molecular orbital or electron density at any
point in space. Once a class structure had been developed

for Gaussian type orbitals, the approach was extended
to read in several other popular output ﬁle formats
including Q-Chem, GAMESS-US, NWChem, and Mol-
pro. MOPAC200x support was added later, along with
support for the AUX format and Slater type orbitals used
in that code. All of these codes output their ﬁnal conﬁg-
urations using the standard linear combination of atomic
orbitals, meaning that parallelization is extremely simple.
The plugin was developed to take advantage of the map-
reduce approach oﬀered by QtConcurrent in order to
use all available processor cores. This oﬀers almost lin-
ear scaling as each point in the grid can be calculated
independently of all other points, the results of which can
be seen in Figure 9. An alternate approach to calculating
the molecular orbitals was developed in a second plu-
gin that has since been split oﬀinto a separate project
named “OpenQube”. The “OpenQube” library has also
been added as an optional backend in VTK during the
2011 Google Summer of Code, bringing support for sev-
eral output ﬁle formats and calculation of cube ﬁles that
can later be fed into more advanced data pipelines.
A class hierarchy with a standard API is provided for
quantum output. Adding support for new codes involved
developing a new parser and ensuring the Gaussian or

Slater set is populated with the correct ordering and the
expected normalization scheme. The s, p, and d-type
Gaussian orbitals are supported, with f and g support
planned in order to support the increasing number of
calculations using these higher-order orbitals. The Basis
Set Exchange hosted by EMSL provides access to the
basis sets in common use, although at present these basis
sets are normally read in directly from the output ﬁles.
There are several related projects for adding semantic
meaning to this type of output, including the JUMBO-
Converters project and Quixote. It is hoped that more
codes will adopt semantic output in the future, using a
common format so that data exchange, validation, and
analysis become easier across several codes. This was
the subject of a recent meeting with several computa-
tional chemistry codes beginning to use FoX in order to
output CML. Development has begun on code to read
in CML output, either directly from the codes or from
conversion of other formats using Open Babel or the
JUMBO-Converters. If enough semantic structure can
be added to CML, and the converters support a large
enough range of the output, this could replace most of
the parsing code present in OpenQube. Semantic mean-
ing is one of the most diﬃcult to extract from log ﬁles,
and coming together as a community will help projects
like Avogadro to derive more meaning from the outputs of
these codes.
Secondary biological structure
Avogadro uses the PDB reader from Open Babel to read
in the secondary biological structure. Two plugins exist
to process and render this information. The ﬁrst is a plu-
gin which renders a simple tube between the biomolecule
backbone atoms. A second more advanced plugin calcu-
lates meshes for the alpha helices and beta sheets. While
the ﬁrst plugin is much faster, the advanced plugin more
accurately produces output expected in the ﬁeld. This
allows users ﬂexibility for rendering secondary biological
structures.
GLSL, novel visualization
GLSL, or OpenGL Shader Language, is a C-like syntax
that can be used to develop code that will run on graphics
cards and included in the OpenGL 2.0 speciﬁcation. It has
been used to great eﬀect by the games industry, as well as
in many areas of data visualization. Several recent papers
highlight the potential in chemistry, such as QuteMol [5]
in adding support for features such as ambient occlusion
to add depth to images.
Avogadro has support for vertex and fragment shader
programs, and several examples are bundled with the
package. If the user’s graphics card is capable, these pro-
grams can be loaded at runtime and used to great eﬀect
to visualize structure. Some of these include summariza-
tion techniques such as isosurface rendering where only
the edges orthogonal to the view plane are visible, giv-
ing a much better rendering of both the molecular and
electronic structure (Figure 10).
Ray tracing
Avogadro uses a painter abstraction that makes it much
easier for developers to add new display types. It also
abstracts away the renderer, making it possible to add
support for alternative backends. Currently only OpenGL
and POV-Ray are supported. Due to the abstraction, we
are able to use the implicit surfaces available in ray trac-
ers to render molecular structure at very high levels of
clarity and with none of the triangle artifacts present in
standard OpenGL rendered images. Much higher quality
transparency and reﬂection also allow for the images to be
used in poster and oral presentations as well as research
articles (Figure 11).
This feature is implemented in an extension, with an
additional painter class deriving from the base class and
a dialog allowing the user to edit the basic rendering
controls. The POV-Ray input ﬁle can also be retained
and edited to produce more complex images, or to
allow for much ﬁner control of the rendering process if
desired.

Avogadro library in use
The Avogadro library’s ﬁrst use was the Avogadro appli-
cation, closely followed by the Kalzium periodic table
program that is part of the KDE software collection. This
initial work was funded in part by the Google Summer
of Code program in 2007, and also resulted in the addi-
tion of several other features in the Avogadro library to
support Kalzium and general visualization and editing of
molecular structure (Figure 12).
The Q-Chem package [70] has developed “QUI - The
Q-Chem User Interface” [73] around Avogadro, originally
as an Avogadro extension. This is a more advanced ver-
sion of the input generator developed in Avogadro, with
much tighter integration. Molpro [71] has also published
some results from their development of a Molpro interface
using the Avogadro library [74].
Packmol
Packmol is a third-party package designed to create ini-
tial “packed” conﬁgurations of molecules for molecular
dynamics or other simulations [75,76]. Examples include
surrounding a protein with solvent, solvent mixtures, lipid
bilayers, spherical micelles, placing counterions, adding
ligands to nanoparticles, etc. Typically, users may have
equilibrated “solvent boxes” which have been run for long
simulations to ensure proper density, and both short and
long-range interactions between solvent molecules. Using
such solvent boxes allows placing solute molecules, such

as proteins, in an approximately correct initial structure,
such as that shown in Figure 13. The solute is added into
the box, and solvent molecules with overlapping atoms are
removed. While these utilities are often enough, creating
complex input ﬁles is not always easy. For more compli-
cated systems, Packmol can create an initial conﬁguration
based on deﬁned densities, geometries (e.g., sphere, box,
etc.), and the molecules to be placed. An Avogadro devel-
oper wrote an external plugin to facilitate use of Packmol,
including estimating the number of molecules in a given
volume.
The plugin is not currently distributed with Avogadro as
a standard feature, although it is planned for some future
version. It serves as an example of how Avogadro can facil-
itate a workﬂow with a text-oriented package (Packmol),
including saving ﬁles in the PDB format required by Pack-
mol, generating an input ﬁle, and reading the output for
visualization, analysis, and further simulations.

XtalOpt
The XtalOpt [77,78] software package is implemented as a
third-party C++ extension to Avogadro and makes heavy
use of the libavogadro API. The extension implements
an evolutionary algorithm tailored for crystal structure
prediction. The XtalOpt development team chose Avo-
gadro as a platform because of its open-source license,
well-designed API, powerful visualization tools, and intu-
itive user-interface. XtalOpt exists as a dialog window
(Figure 14) and uses the main Avogadro window for visu-
alizing candidate structures as they evolve. The API is well
suited for XtalOpt’s needs, providing a simple mechanism
to allow the user to view, edit, and export the struc-
tures generated during the search. Taking advantage of the
cross-platform capabilities of Avogadro and its dependen-
cies, XtalOpt is available for Linux, Windows, and Mac.
Conclusions
Avogadro has grown over its ﬁrst six years to become an
important tool for building, editing, visualizing, and ana-
lyzing chemical and molecular data. With over 270,000
downloads, language translations and localizations, and
over 100 citations, it has become an integral part of the
chemical software toolbox. Through use of the native
CML ﬁle format and a wide variety of chemical data
import, Avogadro can provide semantic chemical data
editing and conversion. We seek to provide an inte-
grated environment in the simulation and cheminfor-
matics workﬂow. While more must be done, particularly
in regards to documentation, tutorials, ease-of-use, and
automation, we aim to improve the quality and feature set
with each new release.
Currently, two upcoming versions of Avogadro are
under development. The ﬁrst is Avogadro version 1.1,
which adds additional features and reﬁnement, par-
ticularly including crystallography support developed
through the XtalOpt project. The second is a more sub-
stantial development for Avogadro version 2.0, where
many of the core data structures are being rewritten
in order to oﬀer greater ﬂexibility and scalability. Our
goal is to support an increasing scope of chemical sys-
tems, including biomolecules (DNA, RNA, saccarides,
etc.), materials (crystallography, polymers, surfaces),
nanoscience (nanoparticles, nanotubes, graphene, etc.)
with improved speed, intuitive ease-of-use and simpler
non-reciprocal licensing terms.
