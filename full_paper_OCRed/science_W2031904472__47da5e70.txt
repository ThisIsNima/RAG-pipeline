I. Introduction 
Electron-transfer reactions between ions and 
molecules in solution have been the subject of 
considerable experimental study during the past 
three decades. Experimental results have also been 
obtained on related phenomena, such as reactions 
between ions or molecules and electrodes, charge- 
transfer spectra, photoelectric emission spectra of 
ionic solutions, chemiluminescent electron trans- 
fers, electron transfer through frozen media, and 
electron transfer through thin hydrocarbon-like 
films on electrodes. 
For 'outer-sphere' electron-transfer reactions in 
solution there have also been extensive develop- 
ments in the theory. Quantitative predictions of 
the theory, without adjustable parameters, include 
[1-31 (1) rate constants of 'cross-reactions' from 
those of self-exchange reactions, (2) the relation 
between the rate constant of a reaction and the 
driving force for the reaction (standard free energy 
of reaction AGO), (3) nonspecific solvent effects on 
the rate constant, (4) the relation between rates of 
self-exchange reactions in solution and rate of 
electron transfer between one of the reactants and 
an electrode, (5) the calculation of rate constants 
of electron-transfer reactions from molecular size, 
bond length changes, vibration frequencies, and 
solvent properties, and (6) the 'inverted' effect. 
By and large, as shown later in this review, 
these predictions have been successful for a large 
body of experimental data. In some cases, cited 
later, there have been major deviations, which 
have sometimes been used as diagnostic mechanis- 
tic tools. In some cases, too, there have been 
trends in relatively minor discrepancies and these, 
too, are discussed. 
Some of these theoretical predictions (notably 
those arising from the dependence of the activa- 
tion-free energy barrier on'intrinsic' (~,) and ther- 
modynamic (AG °) factors) have been extended to 
other quite different types of reactions, such as 
atom and proton transfers [4-6], group transfers 
[7,9], hydride transfers [10,11], proton-bound di- 
mers [12], gas phase ion-molecule reactions [13,14] 
and conformational equilibria [15]. The main ques- 
tions, however, for the present article, are: (1) 
what predictions for reactions in solution can be 
extended to electron transfers in biological sys- 
tems, and (2) what can the theory say about the 
interpretation of some current experimental re- 
sults? Both of these questions will be addressed. 
We begin with a review of the concepts and 
equations for electron transfers in solution. 
II. Electron-transfer reactions in solution. Theory 
11.4. Classical theory 
The theory of electron-transfer reactions in 
solution has been summarized and reviewed in 
many texts and articles, e.g., Refs. 16-27. In the 
present section we briefly summarize the relevant 
concepts and equations, so as to serve as a. basis 
for the comparison with experiment and for their 
extension to biological systems. 
We shall be concerned in this section primarily 
with what has been termed outer-sphere bimolecu- 
lar electron-transfer reactions, i.e., with reactions 
in which the two reactants do not share a common 
atom or group, or, more generally, reactions in 
which the interaction of the relevant electronic 
orbitals of the two centers is weak. This cir- 
cumstance greatly simplifies the theoretical devel- 
opment. 
For reaction to occur, the reactants must ap- 
proach each other to enhance the coupling of their 
electronic orbitals, and at the same time there

----- Page 3 (native) -----
must be fluctuations in other coordinates. As in 
any reaction the system as a whole proceeds from 
configurations (coordinates) in the vicinity of the 
equilibrium ones for the reactants to those for the 
products. In the present case, these coordinates 
involve vibrational coordinates of the reactants, 
when their equilibrium values differ before and 
after electron transfer, as well as the orientational 
coordinates of the surrounding solvent molecules: 
averaged equilibrium orientations of those solvent 
molecules differ for reactants and products be- 
cause each reactant undergoes a change of charge. 
The potential energy of the reactants and sur- 
rounding medium is a function of all of these 
nuclear coordinates (thousands of them), and de- 
fines a many-dimensional potential-energy surface. 
A one-dimensional profile of such a many-dimen- 
sional surface is given schematically in Fig. 1, and 
is labelled R. The profile for the products and 
surrounding medium is labelled P. If there are N 
coordinates the intersection point in Fig. 1 repre- 
sents an (N- 1)-dimensional surface in the N-di- 
mensional coordinate space ~ 
Because the electron being transferred is such a 
light particle, the Franck-Condon principle § can 
be applied to this weak overlap electron transfer 
(small overlap of the electronic orbitals). It then 
follows that transfer will occur only at or near 
nuclear configurations for which the total poten- 
tial energy of the reactants and surrounding 
medium is equal to that of the products and 
The actual profile of the many-dimensional surface is more 
complicated than Fig. 1 when there are solvation contribu- 
tions- there are many local potential-energy minima, for 
example. In that case only the profile of the free energy (in 
effect, a Boltzmann-weighted profile) of a system consisting 
of the pair of reactants, at a given separation, and their 
environment, along the reaction coordinate could have a 
quadratic appearance. Such an approximation is much less 
drastic than assuming that the potential energy is a quadratic 
function of the coordinates. 
§ According to the Franck-Condon principle, during the actual 
(instantaneous) electron transfer the nuclei do not have time 
to change either their positions or their momenta. To satisfy 
reasonably both conditions simultaneously, the transfer has 
to occur at nuclear configurations stated in this paragraph, 
namely at or near the intersection region in Fig. 1. The 
entropy of the reactants (plus environment) and that of the 
products (plus environment) are equal on the intersection 
surface, as are their energies and hence, also, their free 
energies [2].

surrounding medium, i.e., at the intersection in 
Fig. 1. Thermal fluctuations of the coordinates 
from values near the minimum of the R surface 
are needed in order for the reacting system to 
reach the intersection region in Fig. 1. 
Fluctuations in the vibrational coordinates need 
be considered when a reactant has different equi- 
librium bond lengths (or bond angles) in its two 
redox states. The systems studied vary widely in 
this respect, as we shall see in Section III. In 
addition, fluctuations in the orientational coordi- 
nates of the solvent molecules are needed when the 
solvent is polar. In the latter case the mean orien- 
tation of each solvent molecule at any position 
near the reacting pair is significantly different for 
reactants and products, as already noted. 
Once the system reaches the intersection of the 
two curves in Fig. 1 the probability of going from 
the R to the P surface depends on a number of 
factors, such as the extent of coupling of the 
electronic orbitals of the two reactants, which in 
turn depends on the separation distance r of the 
reactants or, more precisely, on the dominant range 
of separation distances contributing to the reac- 
tion (cf. discussion later). 
It is useful at this point to consider the effective 
potential energy curve for the electronic motion, 
and relate it to plots such as the one in Fig. 1 for 
the nuclear motion. A series of such curves for

corresponding (nuclear) potential-energy curves on the right. 
The electronic energies in the two wells are indicated on the left 
for three nuclear configurations A, B, and C for the reaction 
red 1 +ox 2 ----} ox 1 +red 2. The levels in the wells are vertical 
ionization energies: the filled and open circles denote, respec- 
tively, ionization of the reduced state at its equilibrium nuclear 
configuration and at the equilibrium configuration appropriate 
to its oxidized state; the half-filled circles refer to ionization of 
the reduced state at the nuclear configuration appropriate to 
the intersection region. The level in well 1 is initially occupied 
in (a) and the level in well 2 in (c). 
different nuclear configurations (A, B, and C in 
Fig. 1) is shown in Fig. 2a-c. The effective 
one-electron potential-energy curve with two wells 
is given in Fig. 2a. Also given are two electronic- 
energy levels of the entire system, one when an 
electronic orbital of reactant 1 is occupied, and the 
other when an orbital of reactant 2 is occupied. 
Initially, in a reaction between the reduced form of 
reactant 1 and the oxidized form of reactant 2, an 
electronic orbital of reactant 1 is occupied. The 
nuclear configuration is labelled A in Fig. 1 (and 
in Fig. 2a), and is a configuration that is an 
equilibrium one for the reactants ('redl' and 'ox 2'). 
The relation of these two electronic-energy levels 
in Fig. 1 to the nuclear potential-energy curves is 
indicated by the dashed lines in Fig. 2a. 
After a suitable fluctuation of positions of the 
nuclei in the system prior to electron transfer, a 
nuclear configuration such as B in Fig. 1 is formed 
and the positions of the two electronic-energy 
levels are indicated on the left-side of Fig. 2b; that 
of the electronic orbital in well 1 has been raised 
and that of well 2 has been lowered. The relation- 
ship of these levels to Fig. 1 is again indicated by 
dashed lines in Fig. 2b. Now the electron can 
transfer from well 1 to well 2. 
A further fluctuation in the positions of the 
nuclei in the entire system to form a set of nuclear 
configurations which is an equilibrium one for the 
products leads to Fig. 2c. The electronic energy 
when well 2 is occupied now is the lower one: The 
relation of these energy levels to Fig. 1 is again 
indicated by dashed lines in Fig. 2c. 
We shall denote by ~:(r) the transmission coef- 
ficient or averaged transition probability for elec- 
tron transfer per passage of the system through the 
intersection region of Fig. 1, at a fixed separation 
distance r of the two reactants. This x(r), dis- 
cussed in Section IV, is usually assumed to vary at 
large r approximately as exp(-fir) I. When suita- 
bly averaged over r, x(r) will be denoted by ~. 
For a reaction in which there is substantial elec- 
tronic coupling between the reactants ('adiabatic 
reactions'), K is about unity [25]. 
The calculation of the rate constant of an elec- 
tron-transfer reaction involves calculating the 
probability of reaching the many-dimensional in- 
tersection region, due to the fluctuations described 
above, multiplied by a suitably weighted frequency 
for crossing the intersection region and by a tran- 
sition probability for going from the R to the P 
surface. The net result of this calculation is that 
the rate constant k of a bimolecular electron- 
transfer reaction is given by 
k = IcAo 2 exp(-AG*/RT), 
(1) 
where AO 2 has dimensions of collision frequency 
(its value is given in Appendix I), o is the average 
center-to-center distance in the reacting pair dur- 
ing the electron transfer (the mean separation dis- 
tance in the transition state of the reaction), AG* 
is the free energy of activation that is related to 
(described below), to AG °, the 'standard' free en- 
Evidence that in some systems the distance dependence may 
be somewhat less than exponential is given in Ref. [28].

AG O' = AG O + w p- w r 
(3) 
Molecular theory (specifically the use of molec- 
ular vibrational coordinates) was used to calculate 
the contribution h i of changes in the bond lengths 
of the reactants to h. To obtain a simple expres- 
sion for the contribution ho of changes in solvent 
orientation coordinates to A, dielectric continuum 
theory was used. (A statistical mechanical treat- 
ment is also given in Ref. 3.) In this way ~ was 
found to be given by [3,27]:

where fir is the jth normal mode force constant in 
the reactants, fjP is that in the products, Aqj is the 
change in equilibrium value of the jth normal 
coordinate, Ae is the charge transferred from one 
reactant to the other, a 1 and a 2 are the radii of 
the two (spherical) reactants, r is the center-to- 
center separation distance (r equals the o in Eqn. 
1), and Ds and Dop are the static and optical 
(square of refractive index) dielectric constants of 
the solvent, respectively. 
In the derivation of Eqns. 1-6, the vibrations 
The ZIG ° introduced here is obtained from concentration 
measurements in the prevailing medium and in Refs. 3 and 
27 is shown to be the appropriate quantity to be used in 
Eqns. 1-3. It is slightly different from the standard free 
energy of reaction which is based on standard states. The 
present AG O was denoted by a primed quantity in Refs. 3 
and 27 but we use a simpler notation here and use a primed 
quantity for the work-corrected free energy of reaction, de- 
fined in Eqn. 3. The Z~G °' in Eqn. 3 equals the free energy of 
reaction when the reactants are a distance r apart in the 
prevailing medium.

within the reactants were treated as harmonic 
oscillators, but no such restrictive assumption was 
made for the solvent outside of the coordination 
shells. What was assumed was, rather, that the 
dielectric polarization outside the coordination 
shells responded linearly to any change in (real or 
fictitious) charges, and hence that free energy 
depended quadratically on charging parameters 
('dielectric unsaturation approximation') [1-3] §. 
Such a treatment allows the individual solvent 
dipoles to move very anharmonically, as indeed 
they do in a liquid. 
Equations 1-6 can be given a physical interpre- 
tation discussed elsewhere [26]. For example, when 
D s equals Dop, the solvent molecules are nonpolar 
and h o vanishes. Again, the larger the radii of the 
reactants, the smaller the charge-solvent interac- 
tions and the smaller X o. 
The 'cross-relation' [2,3,27] follows from these 
equations, by noting from Eqns. 4-6 that ~ for 
the cross-reaction (X12), Eqn. 7, 
k12 
red I + ox 2 --, ox 1 + red 2 
(7) 
is approximately the mean of the X's of the self-ex- 
change reactions ~11 and X22.

(9) 
From this result one finds when the transmission 
coefficients ~ are approximately unity, and when 
the self-exchange rate constants kii are either cor- 
rected for the work terms or when the latter ap- 
proximately cancel, that k12 is given by Eqn. 10: 
kl 2 = (kllk22K12fl 2)1/2 
(10) 
§ As indicated earlier, such an assumption about the tree 
energy, a thermodynamic quantity which involves statistical 
averaging over many coordinates, is much less drastic than 
assuming that the potential-energy function for the surround- 
ing solvent molecules is a quadratic function of their coordi- 
nates.

where K12 is the equilibrium constant of reaction 
7 in the prevailing medium, i.e.,K12 is equal to 
exp(-AG°/RT), 
and fl2 is a known function of 
kll , k22 and K12 (lnfl 2 = ~(ln K12)2//ln(kllkE2// 
Z2), where Z = A011022; in practice f12 is often 
close to unity). A modification of this equation 
when the r's are less than unity has been given 
[21]. 
Several applications of Eqns. 1-6 are given in 
Section III, including comparison of the cross-rela- 
tion Eqn. 10 with the experimental data, ab initio 
calculation of rate constants, study of nonspecific 
solvent effects, and relation between rates and 
equilibrium constants. 
We have already noted that a range of sep- 
aration distances r contributes to the rate con- 
stant. To make x(r) large, r should be small; on 
the other hand, any short-range or Coulombic 
repulsion between the reactants will favor large r. 
A compromise in r results, and we obtain ap- 
proximately Eqn. 1 (cf. Ref. 3 and Appendix I). 
More refined rate expressions can also be derived. 
Expressions have also been derived for the 
outer-sphere electron transfer between an• ion or 
molecule and an electrode [27,29-31]. The/expres - 
sions are similar to Eqns. (1-6), only now Ao 2 is 
replaced by a related quantity which has dimen- 
sions of a collision frequency of the ion with unit 
area of the electrode (= 1 • 104 cm. s-l), r is now 
twice the distance of the center of the ion to the 
electrode surface, 1/2a 2 is missing from Eqn. 6 
(a 2 tends to infinity), the summation in Eqn. 5 is 
over the vibrational coordinates of one ion instead 
of two, and AG O is replaced by the activation 
overpotential. When the rate constant for self-ex- 
change in solution k~x is then compared with the 
rate constant for reaction between one of these 
ions and an electrode at zero activation overpoten- 
tial, kel, one finds from Eqns. 1-6 and from the 
equations for the corresponding reaction at an 
electrode that, approximately,

-- Z~l 
center-to-center separation distance o of the re- 
actants in the homogeneous reaction is twice that 
from the center of the reactant to the electrode. 
However, an adsorbed solvent layer on the elec- 
trode may cause the latter separation distance to 
be somewhat larger. The effect of this increased r 
on ke! causes the inequality in Eqn. 11, and the 
effect can be calculated. The equations are applied 
to electrode systems in Section III. 
In deriving the preceding formulae the motion 
of the nuclei was treated classically. In practice 
there may be some nuclear tunneling through the 
barrier in Fig. 1, e.g., depicted schematically by a 
horizontal motion from a to b in Fig. 3. The 
nuclear tunneling in Fig. 3 at room temperature 
typically accounts, in the so-called normal region, 
for only a relatively minor factor (F in Table II) in 
the rate constants, which due to variations in 
and AG O , may vary by some 15 or more orders of 
magnitude from system to system. Examples are 
given later in Table II. The cross-relation in the 
normal region is even less affected, because of 
'partial cancellation of the quantum corrections in 
the ratio k12/(kll k22 K12 )1/2. Nuclear tunneling in 
the 'inverted region', defined below, has a larger 
effect, as discussed later. 
When AG O' is made increasingly negative at 
constant ?~, for example, by suitable variation of a 
ligand in a reactant, one sees from Eqn. 2 that the 
free-energy barrier to reaction AG* initially de- 
creases and that, when -AG O exceeds ?~, AG* 
begins to increase. This region where -AG°'> 
2~ 
has been termed the inverted region [3], and some 
consequences are described in Section III. Physi-

cally, in terms of Fig. 1, this effect of making AG O 
more negative at constant A can be seen to corre- 
spond to lowering the P surface vertically (or 
raising the R surface). The intersection of the R 
and P surfaces eventually occurs at the minimum 
of the R surface and there is then no barrier. 
Further lowering raises the point of intersection, 
as in Fig. 4, and hence now raises the barrier, i.e., 
increases zaG*. 
In the case of Fig. 4, nuclear tunneling at some 
energy, from the R to the P surface, is represented 
by a horizontal motion from a to b, as in Fig. 5 ¶ 
Here, the slopes of the potential-energy surfaces R 
and P have the same sign near the intersection 
region, unlike the case in Fig. 3, and the semi- 
classical theory of nuclear tunneling shows that 
tunneling is now much more important. Typically, 
nuclear tunneling is treated in the case of Figs. 3 
and 5 either by calculation of quantum mechanical 
Franck-Condon factors (appearing in the next sec- 
tion) § or by semiclassical nuclear tunneling equa- 
tions. The theoretical equations for these quantum

I In most chemical reactions nuclear tunneling is usually im- 
portant only for protons. However, for the present reactions, 
the potential-energy barrier for changes in metal-ligand bond 
lengths is so narrow (e.g., as seen from the Ado's in Table II) 
that even ligands can tunnel at room temperature (e.g., see F 
factors in Table II).

calculations are referred to in Section IIB. Exam- 
ples of the results are given in Section III. 
A corollary of Fig. 4 involves the formation of 
electronically excited products, 
i.e., 
a 
chemi- 
luminescent reaction occurs: although the ground 
electronic-state potential-energy surface P for the 
products may intersect R at a high point, the 
surface in which one of the products is electroni- 
cally excited, P*, may intersect in a more favorable 
region, as in Fig. 4, and then one may obtain 
preferential formation of the less thermodynami- 
cally favored products [33,34]. This preferential 
( -~ 100%) formation of electronically excited prod- 
ucts has been observed experimentally [35], and 
one explanation is the predicted 'inverted effect'. 
Direct experimental confirmation of the inverted 
effect has recently been obtained [36-38] (cf. Ref. 
39 and also a discussion of other studies [27]). 
Various other classical treatments of the prob- 
lem have also been given, including the treatment 
motion. It is small when the region of space occupied by the 
reactants' relevant wavefunction for the nuclear motion is 
rather different from that occupied by the products' 
wavefunction, for example, when there is a large difference of 
the equilibrium bond lengths and when, at the same time, the 
two wavefunctions refer to relatively unexcited vibrational 
quantum states. When the overlap of two such wavefunctions 
of the same energy is small, it can be shown that an equiv- 
alent semiclassical interpretation is that the states are con- 
nected not by a classically allowed path but by a nuclear 
tunneling through a barrier separating the reactants' and 
products' regions of vibrational coordinate space. (The argu- 
ment is based on a semiclassical evaluation of the overlap 
integral,related to that given in Ref. 32.)

of vibrations and solvation [40] and of vibrations 
alone [41,42]. The expressions in Ref. 40 for the 
solvation are the same as those in Ref. 1 I. The 
vibrations were treated using calculated force fields 
rather than experimental vibration frequencies. The 
vibrational results in Refs. 41 and 42 are for 
self-exchange reactions, rather than cross-reac- 
tions, and a simple force field was assumed (no 
cross-terms in bond force constants). 
In the foregoing discussion we have explicitly 
considered outer-sphere electron transfers. The 
latter differ from 'inner-sphere' electron transfers. 
In the latter, the two reactants approach each 
other closely enough that they actually share in 
common a ligand or atom in their coordination 
shells. This strong interaction is then followed by 
either an electron, atom, or radical transfer. Such 
bond formation and rupture requires a modified 
treatment from that leading to Eqns. 1-6. The 
cross-relations can still apply [4,9,10,44], provided 
the cross-reaction and the self-exchange reactions 
have a similar mechanism. 
liB. Quantum-mechanical aspects 
In Eqns. 1-6 the motion of the nuclei was 
treated classically. Quantum mechanical treat- 
ments of the nuclear coordinates have been made 
for cases where additional approximations have 
been imposed (e.g., 45-56). These treatments were 
almost exclusively for reactions having very weak 
electronic coupling, namely having r << 1 in Eqn. 
1. 
The first-order rate constant for electron trans- 
fer at fixed r is now given by 
k = ~ H2B(FC), 
(12) 
where HAa is the electronic matrix element de- 
scribing the electronic coupling of the reactants' 
electronic state with the products', and is equal to 
~1 Recently, another treatment of the solvent for organic sys- 
tems has been assumed in which the solvent near a singly 
charged organic ion is assigned a harmonic oscillator force 
constant (for the ion-solvent interaction) which is consider- 
ably changed when the ion loses its charge [43]. This interpre- 
tation is discussed in Appendix ID. 
one-half the separation of the dotted curves at the 
intersection of the R and P surfaces in Fig. 1. The 
quantity (FC) is the 'Franck-Condon' factor: it is 
a sum of products of overlap integrals of the 
vibrational and solvational wavefunctions of the 
reactants with those of the products, suitably 
weighted by Boltzmann factors. Purely vibrational 
Franck-Condon factors are available in various 
reviews and articles, e.g., Refs. 21, 45 and 57. 
Typically, quantum-mechanical theories [45-56] 
for the nuclear motion have either: 
(i) treated all coordinates (solvent alone or 
inner-shell plus solvent) at fixed r as a collection 
of 
independent 
oscillators, 
harmonic 
or 
anharmonic (' Morse') §, or 
(ii) treated quantum-mechanically the inner- 
shell coordinates as harmonic (or Morse) oscilla- 
tors, but treated the motion (orientational, libra- 
tional) of the solvent outside the inner-coordina- 
tion shell as classical, using the free energy of 
solvent reorganization in Ref. 1. 
With this classification in mind we consider 
next the relation between Eqn. 12 and its classical 
counterpart for treatment of the motion of the 
nuclei. When the solvent molecules are treated as a 
collection of oscillators, namely when assumption 
(i) is made, Eqn. 12 may be rewritten as 
2qr 
2 
k=~-H~B ~ (FC)vp(Or) 
(13) 
Or~Vp 
where (FC)v is the Franck-Condon (vibrational 
overlap) factor for any given set of vibrational 
quantum numbers Vr of the reactants' and Vp of 
the products' system (including the solvent oscilla- 
tors), p(vr) is the equilibrium (Boltzmann) prob- 
ability of finding the system in the vibrational 
state Or, and the sum is over all o r and Vp. When 
all of the vibrational frequencies ~'i in (FC) are 
relatively small, e.g., hvi/2kT<~ 1, and when they 
are unchanged by reaction, Eqn. 13 reduces to 
§ With the aid of this assumption, the quantity (FC) in Eqn. 
12 can be evaluated. However, when the solvent is treated 
more realistically, namely, by permitting the solvent mole- 
cules to perform their actual complicated coupled anharmonic 
motions, no practical evaluation of (FC) has yet been made. 
Only a formal expression involving overlap integrals for the 
entire system has been given [58].

where AE °' is the energy (enthalpy) of reaction at 
the separation distance r in the prevailing medium 
and is negative for an exothermic reaction. On the 
other hand, when only some of the vibration fre- 
quencies are treated as relatively small and un- 
changed by reaction, with a contribution to k 
denoted by ko, one obtains [47,49,50] from Eqn.

In applications of Eqn. 15, Xo is typically in- 
tended to represent the orientational contribution 
from the solvent molecules outside the inner-coor- 
dination shells of the reactants and is usually 
assumed to be given by Eqn. 6. The quantity A% is 
the vibrational energy of the products minus that 
of the reactants for the set of quantum numbers 
(vr, vp). 
When assumption (ii) is made instead, Eqn. 13 
can be rewritten [52,55,56] as Eqn. 16, which now 
contains AG o' instead of the AE °' in the exponent 
in Eqn. 15:

(16) 
The factor in the sum in Eqn. 16 multiplying 
(FC)op(Vr) is equivalent to a Boltzmann-weighted 
sum of solvational Franck-Condon factors. Eqn. 
16 has been recently derived [58] using semiclassi- 
cal theory (e.g., Ref. 59) to treat the reorienta- 
tional motion of the solvent. In that way, the 
reorientational contribution of the solvent to (FC) 
in Eqn. 12 was converted to a classical expression 
without introducing any harmonic oscillator or 
near-harmonic oscillator approximation for the 
molecular motion of the solvent. In the high-tem- 
273 
perature limit, Eqn. 16 reduces to

e_(AGO'+x)2/4XR T 
k- ~ 
AB (4~rXRT)a/2 
(17) 
where k is k o + ~k i. Eqn. 17 has the same form as 
Eqns. 1 and 2 (w p-- w r= 0 in a fixed site in- 
tramolecular reaction), and provides by compari- 
son a value when K << 1 for the rv appearing later 
in Eqn. 31 for this fixed-site system. 
Unlike Eqn. 16, Eqn. 15 has a major defect 
when there is a significant entropy of reaction 
AS °. In the presence of a polar environment there 
can be large entropic effects, not reproduced by 
Eqns. 13-15. These entropic effects result mainly 
from changes in freedom of the rotations and 
librations of the solvent molecules. An example of 
a reaction with a large AS ° is Fe(H20)2+ + 
Ru(bpy) 3+ ---, Fe(n20) 3+ + Ru(bpy)2+: for this 
reaction AS ° is -180 J. mo1-1, deg -1 (e.g., cited 
in Ref. 59). Under such conditions assumption (i) 
becomes grossly inadequate. If, however, there were 
no solvation outside the inner coordination shell, 
or if that solvent behaved as a collection of 
harmonic or anharmonic oscillators of fixed fre- 
quencies, one would expect AS ° - 0, and AE ° 
( -- AG O + TAS °) ..~ AG °, and then Eqn. 15 would 
be satisfactory. Because of this inadequacy of as- 
sumption (i) and hence of Eqn. 15, Eqn. 16 has 
frequently been used in articles to estimate quan- 
tum effects, e.g., Refs. 48, 52, 53, 56 and 61. In 
summary, when a large standard entropy change 
AS ° accompanies a reaction, it influences the reac- 
tion rate and Eqns. 14 and 15 do not allow for this 
possibility, while Eqns. 16 and 17 do. Indeed, 
when there is a nonvanishing AS °, Eqns. 14 and 
15 and their counterparts for the reverse reaction 
rate constant kre v do not obey the correct equi- 
librium 
constant 
relation, 
k/kre v = 
exp(-AG°'/RT), 
but Eqns. 16 and 17 do. 
Eqns 12-17 were obtained for reactions with 
x << 1, as already noted. However, the main quan- 
tum correction in Eqn. 16 to the classical equation, 
Eqn. 17, proves to be one for nuclear tunneling, 
and the latter can occur regardless of whether K is 
small or close to unity. Thus, one quantum correc- 
tion to Eqn. 1, which has been used for ~ -- 1, is 
that given by [53,55,61]

----- Page 10 (native) -----
274 
kquantu m • kclassica I ( gC)q/( FC )c 
(18) 
where (FC)q/(FC)c is the ratio of the right-hand 
sides of Eqns. 16 and 17, where the vibrational 
motion is treated in a quantum manner but the 
solvent motion is treated classically. Another way 
of making the quantum correction for nuclear 
tunneling is the WKB method referred to later. 
The ratio kquantum//kclassical has been calculated 
for a number of reactions using Eqn. 18: when ?~i 
is relatively small, as in the Ru(NH3) 3+/2+ self- 
exchange reaction, the calculated ratio of rate con- 
stants is close to unity at room temperature (it 
equals 1.2) [53]. At relatively large values of h i 
and appreciable vibration frequencies, for exam- 
ple, for the Fe(H20)36 +/2+ self-exchange reaction, 
(the metal-ligand symmetric stretching frequency 
for Fe(H20) g+ and for Fe(H20)62+ is 490 and 389 
cm -1, respectively), the ratio is about 4 [53], and 
for the Co(NH3) 3+/2+ self-exchange it is about 6 
[53,62]. The ratio of quantum-mechanical rate con- 
stants, k12//(kllk22K12f12) 1/2, for the reaction 
Fe(H20) 2+ + Ru(bpy) 3+ ---, Fe(H20) 3+ + 
Ru(bpy) 2+ was calculated to differ by only 6% 
from its classical value of unity [53]. I.e., these 
quantum effects have relatively little effect on the 
cross-relation in such cases. Where quantum ef- 
fects on the nuclear motion can be quite large is in 
the inverted region or at low temperature: Refs. 
48-52 and 61 present calculations for a number of 
examples. 
In the case of a highly exothermic reaction and 
when a single vibration frequency v is principally 
involved in the readjustment of nuclear coordi- 
nates associated with the electron transfer, the 
double sum in Eqn. 16 can be approximated by 
[27]:

where F is the Gamma function, S is ~i//h~ ', A~ v 
in Eqn. 15 has become vh~,, and v is approxi- 
mately the solution of 
AG °'+vhv+?~o=-(~)2~°RT In - (AG°hv +~°) 
(20) 
Equations 19 and 20 were in good agreement with 
the quantum result where tested (h~, = 1350 cm-1, 
and ?% not too small, varying from 500 to 2500 
cm -1) [27]. However, it is reasonably straightfor- 
ward instead to evaluate the sum in Eqn. 16 
numerically or by a 'saddle-point' approximation 
(e.g., Ref. 53), particularly for a single frequency 
model. Another approximate quantum expression 
is given and used in Appendix II. 
An alternative treatment has been given for 
vibrational quantum effects, also known some- 
times as the 'semiclassical' treatment [63,64]. The 
expression for the rate constant for electron trans- 
fer between fixed sites is of a form rather similar 
to Eqn. 14, namely:

(4~rXRTx) 1/2 
where 
h~, 
h~, 
X = ~ 
coth 2R----T 
The factor X approaches unity when hp/2RT 
becomes small. Eqn. 21 is readily extended to the 
case of many vibrational coordinates and has the 
advantage of simplicity over Eqn. 12. Its disad- 
vantage is one of accuracy [51,65]. For example for 
the Fe(H20)~ ÷/2+ system, Eqn. 21 has an error of 
a factor of 15-20 at room temperature [65]. The 
source of its difficulty has been identified [65], 
namely in its treatment of nuclear tunneling 
through the potential-energy barrier in Fig. 1. Only 
when the products' surface P is extremely steep at 
the intersection does this particular error become 
small [65]. 
Another treatment, quite different from the 
above one but also labelled semiclassical, involves 
use of a semiclassical ('WKB') approximation for 
the nuclear tunneling probability [66-68]. This 
treatment has been reviewed recently [21] and 
examples of its application are given in Ref. [69], 
both for the cases of small and large x (x ---. 1) in 
Eqn. 1. It has been developed mainly for single- 
frequency systems and, more approximately, for 
other systems. A more general version (many-di- 
mensional) of semiclassical (WKB) theory was 
used, as already noted, in deriving Eqn. 16 [58].

----- Page 11 (native) -----
The main quantum correction for the nuclear mo- 
tion contained in the (FC)v factor in Eqn. 13, but 
absent in Eqn. 14 is, as previously noted, one for 
nuclear tunneling. The semiclassical (WKB) treat- 
ment provides one way of estimating this correc- 
tion. 
HC. Electronic and steric aspects 
The rate of electron transfer depends on the 
nature of the intervening medium and transfers 
through a series of conjugated bonds (~r bonds) 
and through o bonds have been discussed 
[28,70,71]. In extended Hi~ckel calculations the 
dependence of K on r was calculated [28,70] to be 
larger for o- than for 7r-bonded systems. In the 
present article (Section IV) we shall use some 
averaged distance dependence for the protein 
medium; this dependence is suggested by other 
sources of experimental data (subsection IVC). 
Recently, orientation effects on electron-trans- 
fer rates have been treated using a simplified cav- 
ity model for the the reactants (Ref. 72; Cave, 
R.J., Klippenstein, S.J., Marcus, R.A., unpub- 
lished data, and Cave, R.J., Siders, P. and Marcus, 
R.A., unpublished data). Orientation effects for 
,r-electron systems are expected both because of 
the nonspherical nature of the electronic orbitals 
and because of the nonspherical shape of the 
molecules themselves. The relative contributions of 
the two effects have been investigated by making a 
calculation (Ref. 72 and Cave, R.J., Klippenstein, 
S.J. and Marcus, R.A., unpublished data) for 
spheroids, which includes both effects, and for 
spheres, which includes only the orbital shape 
effect. Applications are also being made to ~r-elec- 
tron systems of biochemical interest (Cave, R.J., 
Siders, P. and Marcus, R.A., unpublished data). 
One can expect molecules such as the heme part of 
cytochrome c or 
the porphyrin part 
of 
bacteriochlorophyll to exhibit significant orienta- 
tion contributions to HA2B. 
Steric effects in reactions can also occur, as is 
evident in the difference between the measured 
self-exchange rates of optically active d-helicene 
with its d-helicene anion, as compared with that 
for the reaction with the 1-helicene anion [75]. 
Steric effects have been calculated [76] for the 
Fe(H20)36 +/2+ exchange: in this system the steric 
275 
effect originated from the (calculated) inter- 
penetration of the H20 ligands, to produce a 
greater HAB at small r (approx. 0.525 nm) [77]. 
liD. Nuclear and electron tunneling 
In this section we distinguish and discuss fur- 
ther nuclear and electron tunneling. Nuclear tun- 
neling was depicted in Figs. 3 and 5 I. The nuclear 
tunneling tends to occur at low temperatures, be- 
cause then the probability is small that the re- 
acting system has enough energy to surmount the 
barrier in Figs. 3 and 5. At sufficiently low tem- 
peratures, in fact, all of the reaction occurs by 
nuclear tunneling. The rate is then independent of 
temperature, since reaction is now occurring largely 
at an energy equal to that of the zero-point vibra- 
tional energy of the pair of reactants and sur- 
rounding system (provided the energy correspond- 
ing to the lowest point of the R surface equals or 
exceeds that for the P surface). 
Electron tunneling occurs when the potential 
energy acting on the electron in the space between 
the reacting pair is higher than the energy of the 
electron in its initial localized site, as in Fig. 2. The 
nuclear rearrangement permits, as in Fig. 2b, the 
initial and final localized energy levels of the elec- 
tron to be the same, and the electron can then 
tunnel through its barrier from one site to the 
other. This need for equality or near-equality of 
the electronic-energy levels is a consequence of the 
Franck-Condon principle and energy conserva- 
tion: when the electronic energies are the same at 
the given nuclear configuration (Fig. 2b) then the 
total energy is conserved, since (using classical 
terminology and the F-C principle) the momenta 
of the nuclei and hence their kinetic energies do 
not change instantaneously during the electron 
transfer. Although electron tunneling is a conveni- 
ent term for describing the process of electron 
transfer in Fig. 2b, it is, at best, only a physically 
intuitive one-electron description of the process. A 
more fundamental but more abstract approach 
involves the many-electron quantum mechanical 
¶ Recalling that these figures are profiles of many-dimensional 
surfaces, one sees that this tunneling is also a many-dimen- 
~innal one.

calculation of the HAB in Eqns. 12-17. 
Temperature affects the nuclear motion and 
thereby the Boltzmann probability of attaining 
any range of nuclear configurations such as near 
point a in Fig. 3 or near the intersection region in 
the same figure. Thus it affects the relative contri- 
bution of nuclear tunneling to the reaction rate. 
Temperature does not affect directly the value of 
HAB, although HAB will vary somewhat with 
nuclear configuration (a point neglected in Eqn. 
12, where only the dependence of HAB on the 
separation distance r is considered; the depen- 
dence of HAB on nuclear configuration is discussed 
in Appendix IC). Thus, temperature does not af- 
fect the electron tunneling in Fig. 2 per se: the 
existence of a temperature-independent rate con- 
stant at low temperatures and a temperature-de- 
pendent one at higher temperatures [18] is, instead, 
a manifestation of nuclear tunneling. 
Terms frequently used in the context of elec- 
tron-transfer reactions are 'adiabatic' and 'non- 
adiabatic'. In an adiabatic electron transfer there 
is substantial electronic coupling of the reactant 
pair: there is enough splitting 2HAs of the dotted 
curves in Fig. 1 that this pair remains throughout 
largely or completely on the lowest potential-en- 
ergy surface [25]. (In Fig. 1 this lowest surface is 
the one labelled R in the initial stages of reaction, 
then is the lower of the two dotted surfaces in the 
intersection region, and finally becomes the surface 
labelled P after the passage through that intersec- 
tion region.) For an adiabatic reaction the K in 
Eqn. 1 is unity, or approximately so. 
In a nonadiabatic reaction the electronic cou- 
pling of the reacting pair is so weak, i.e., the HAB 
in Eqn. 12 is so small, that the probability ~ of 
proceeding from the R to the P surface when the 
system is in the vicinity of the intersection region 
in Fig. 1 is very small. Most systems reaching that 
intersection region now remain on the R surface, 
instead of going to the P surface. Eqns. 12-17 and 
21 assume the reaction to be nonadiabatic. For 
reactions intermediate between adiabatic and non- 
adiabatic, and hence with intermediate K, expres- 
sions of the Landau-Zener type are available for 
calculating K, e.g., cited in Refs. 25 and 67, but the 
latter is mainly a refinement only infrequently 
used. In the 'inverted region', namely in the case 
of Fig. 4, where the solid curves again denote the 
adiabatic surfaces, a reaction in which the system 
goes directly from the R surface to the P surface is 
necessarily nonadiabatic and there is no 'adia- 
batic' path [34]: the system must 'jump' from one 
solid curve to the other, unlike Fig. 1, in order to 
form directly the ground state products. 
liE. Relaxation-limited rates 
Throughout this section and the previous one 
the rate expressions have been those which are 
appropriate to 'activation control', in which the 
probability of forming reactive configurations can 
be calculated from an equilibrium-type distri- 
bution function. That is, it is assumed that the 
probability of finding the system in the vicinity of 
the intersection region of Fig. 1 is a near-equi- 
librium one. However, under certain conditions 
the motion leading to the reactive configurations 
may partly involve very slow diffusive steps, either 
in the relative translational motion of the two 
reactants or in fluctuations of the environment 
itself, e.g., a slow diffusive-type dielectric relaxa- 
tion. Then the overall reaction rate may be smaller 
than the above value. Indeed, there are a number 
of cases in the literature where the intrinsic rate of 
a bimolecular reaction is so high that the mutual 
diffusion together of the two reactants itself be- 
comes the slow step. In this case, the preceding 
equations can be used in conjunction with an 
expression for a diffusion-controlled rate constant 
to obtain an expression for the overall reaction 
rate constant (Appendix IA). An example has also 
appeared (cited in Appendix ID) in which the slow 
step is a dielectric relaxation step, the 'activation 
controlled' step being very fast in that example. 
Several papers discussing such a possibility are 
cited in Appendix ID. 
!II. Comparisons of predictions with experimental 
measurements on nonbiological systems 
IIIA. Cross-reactions 
The most frequently used form of the theoret- 
ical equations has been what is now known in the 
literature as the 'cross-relation', Eqn. 10. If the 
work terms in Eqns. 2 and 3 are not neglected, the 
cross-relation, Eqn. 10, becomes Eqn. 22. The latter

----- Page 13 (native) -----
reduces to Eqn. 10, of course, when the work 
terms can be neglected: 
k, 2 = ( k, 1 k22K,2f ~ 2 ),/2 W12, 
(22) 
where now

RT 
Wx2 = exp[-(w,2 + WEt -- W,I -- w22)/2RT ] (24) 
and Z was defined earlier (= AOllO22); W12 is the 
work term for reaction 7, w21 is that for the reverse 
reaction and Wxl and w22 are that for reactions 8 
and 9, respectively. As before, K12 is the equi- 
librium constant expressed in terms of concentra- 
tions in the prevailing medium; it varies with salt 
concentration. 
The work terms wij can be of several types, not 
just electrostatic. One rather approximate (Debye- 
Hiackel) version for the electrostatic contribution 
277 
to the work term is given by 
z~zje2 ( exp( 
1 + BoNC-~ + exp( BoJ-ff ) )

where B = (8,rrNe2/lOOODskT) t/2, o i = a i + a~, oj 
= aj + a~, where a' is the radius of the dominant 
ion of opposite charge in the ionic atmosphere, 
and z i and zj are the charges of the reactants. For 
water at 25°C B equals 3.29 nm -~. Even if Eqn. 
25 provides a first approximation to wij, a free-en- 
ergy term, the corresponding entropy expression is 
probably quite poor, and should not be used to 
calculate the effect of ionic strength on the ent- 
ropy of activation [78]. 
There have been numerous experimental tests 
of the cross-relation Eqn. 10, e.g., Refs. 79-83. 
Some representative examples are shown in Table 
I. The calculated rate constants were obtained 
neglecting the work terms. The entries illustrate 
the fact that the agreement between theory and 
experiment can be very good: the observed and

calculated rate constants generally agree within an 
order of magnitude. There are some relatively 
minor trends: the data in the table are typical in 
that, with one exception, k12,obs a < k12.¢a~cd. How- 
ever, in almost all of these the Fe(H20)36 +/2+ 
couple is one of the reactants (suggesting, as one 
possibility, that its mechanism for self-exchange 
may not be the same as that for the cross-reactions 
[83]). Good agreement is generally found when the 
couples involved are substitution inert. Unless cor- 
rected for work terms, deviations become larger 
when the reactants are oppositely charged. They 
can also be large when the driving force is large 
[88]. In other cases nonelectrostatic contributions 
to the work terms may be important. This appears 
to be the case, for example, in the cross-reactions 
of complexes with aromatic ligands (bipyridine or 
phenanthroline) with aquo ions: in these systems 
the calculated rates are 2-3 orders of magnitude 
faster than the observed rates. Noncancellation of 
the hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions in the 
cross-relation (as well as departures from adia- 
baticity) have been considered as possible reasons 
for the breakdown in these unsymmetrical systems 
[31,79,85,89]. As mentioned above, in certain cases 
a change in mechanism (for example, from outer- 
sphere to inner-sphere) may be involved [83,90]. 
IIIB. Self-exchange reactions 
In the present section we apply the formalism 
to electron exchange rates of metal complexes in 
solution. Because the reactants are chemically sim- 
ilar to the products (merely an interchange of an 
electron) there are no net thermodynamic changes 
associated with the electron transfer; 
conse- 
quently, such reactions have an extra simplicity to 
them- no effect of AG O need be included. In 
addition, in exchange reactions the molecular 
properties of only one redox couple rather than of 
two different redox couples need to be known. 
The rates of a variety of electron exchange 
reactions are summarized in Table II. These reac- 
tions have been selected because they illustrate the 
range of application of the theory and because, as 
will be seen later, several of the couples are used as 
probes of metalloprotein reactivity. As expected, 
the electron exchange rates depend upon the na- 
ture of the metal center as well as upon the nature 
of the surrounding ligands. For a given metal 
center the rates tend to increase with the size of 
the ligands, reflecting the decrease in the magni- 
tude of the solvent reorganization barrier with 
increasing size of the reactants, while, for a given 
set of ligands, the rate constants decrease with

Included in Table II are the rate constants 
calculated from the outer-sphere adiabatic model, 
but corrected (via F) for nuclear tunnelling effects 
[21]. Here, changes in the bond lengths and angles 
within the ligands themselves were not considered 
in calculating hi. The ~'o values for the reactions 
were calculated assuming that r is equal to the 
sum of the radii of the two reactants: support for 
this assumption is provided by the fact that the 
logarithm of the (precursor corrected) rate con- 
stants for the Ru(NH 3 ) 3 +/2 +, Ru(NH 3 ) 5(PY) 3 +/2 +, 
Ru(NH 3) 4 (bpy) 3 +/2 +, Ru(NH 3) 2 (bpy) 3 +/2 +, and 
Ru(bpy) 3+/2÷ exchange reactions, in which the 
sizes of the reactants are systematically increased, 
show a linear dependence upon 1/2a (Fig. 6) [96]. 
The slope is somewhat larger (30%) than the theo- 
retical value of -7.6 nm (the agreement improves 
when inner-shell changes are included). The effect 
of change of metal-ligand bond lengths Ad o on 
AG* is displayed in Fig. 7, where the rate con- 
stants for some thirteen self-exchange reactions are

stant (Appendix IA). The correlation is the one 
expected from Eqn. 5. The comparatively minor 
deviations are, in part, due to differences in the 
normal mode force constants and in F. 
The dependence of the exchange rates on the 
solvent dielectric properties predicted by the model 
is found for some, but not all of the systems 
studied. Thus the predicted dependence on (1/D o _ 
- 1/Ds) is seen for the bis(biphenyl)chromium +~

solvation effects or strong interaction of the re- 
actants could be responsible for the absence of the 
predicted solvent dependence in the Fe(cp)~ -/° sys- 
tem (where the ligand carries a net negative charge).

In view of the generally excellent agreement of 
the observed and calculated exchange rate con- 
stants it is tempting to conclude that the model is 
essentially correct and, in particular, that the as- 
sumption that x-= 1 is justified for the systems 
considered. This assumption has been explored 
theoretically for a few systems. For example, in the 
case of ruthenium systems the spatial extension of 
the ruthenium 4d orbitals and the electron delo- 
calization on to the ligands through ~r-backbond- 
ing effects suggest that x for these exchanges is 
unlikely to be much less than unity [101]. Con- 
sistent with this conclusion, a value of K = 0.2 has 
been calculated for the Ru(NH3) 3+/2+ exchange 
reaction [77]. On the other hand, on the basis of 
direct 4d-4d overlap of the metal centers, the 
Ru(bpy) 3+/2÷ exchange would be highly non- 
adiabatic at the separation distance defined by 
first contact of the bipyridine ligands of the two 
reactants (K=10 -4 based on a fl value in 
exp[ - fl(r - r 0 )] of 0.12 nm- ~ ). However, a x value 
of about unity has been suggested for the 
Ru(bpy)33 +/2+ exchange by estimating the ~r*-~r* 
interaction of the two reactants resulting from the 
delocalization of the metal d,r electron density 
onto the ~r* orbitals of the bipyridine ligands 
[1011. 
Possible nonadiabatic effects have also been 
explored in calculations for some of the other 
systems. Recent calculations of ~:(r) for the 
Fe(H20) 3+/2+ exchange indicate that the opti- 
mum r occurs at 0.525 nm, appreciably smaller 
than the separation distance 0.65 nm defined by 
the effective radii of the reactants [76]. The calcu- 
lations yield x(r) = 0.2 at r = 0.525 nm compared 
with ~(r) = 10 -2 at r = 0.65 nm. The dependence 
of x(r) on orientation at small r's (0.525 nm) 
introduces a steric factor there, as noted earlier. 
In contrast to the ruthenium and iron ex- 
changes, the cobalt exchanges are accompanied by 
a spin change and on this basis should proceed 
very slowly: K for the cobalt exchanges has been 
estimated to be 10 -3±1 at r=0.68 nm [21]. De- 
spite this, the good agreement in Table II of the 
observed rate with the rate calculated assuming 
K = 1 leaves very little room for any special non- 
adiabaticity in the cobalt exchanges. The same 
conclusion has also been reached in a more exten- 
sive comparison of rates, where it was found that 
the data for a variety of exchanges (including 
cobalt systems) are consistent with K > 10 -2 [78]. 
Since many of the cobalt systems studied involve 
changes in spin quantum number, these results 
suggest that spin multiplicity restrictions per se are 
generally not of major importance in determining 
electron-transfer rates between transition metal 
complexes. For systems where the spin-orbit cou- 
pling is small, for example in electron-transfer 
involving organic systems, the spin restrictions can 
be more important and would reduce the value of 
Good agreement between the observed and 
calculated exchange rates is not always obtained: 
for example, the Co(H20) 3+/2+ exchange reaction 
proceeds about 107-times more rapidly than pre- 
dicted [21]. Clearly, there is a more favorable 
pathway for this reaction than the simple outer- 
sphere exchange considered. Various possibilities 
have been proposed including a pre-equilibrium 
spin change [101] and an inner-sphere water- 
bridged mechanism [90]. 
IIIC. Relation between rates and equilibrium con- 
stants 
We next consider reactions in which the elec- 
tron transfer is accompanied by a net chemical 
change. For such systems the formalism predicts a

----- Page 17 (native) -----
linear relationship between log k and log K (de- 
noted earlier by K12 ) provided that IAG°'I << h. 
More generally, plots of log k vs. log K are 
predicted from Eqns. 1-3 to be curved with a local 
slope a (at any particular value of AG °') given by 
a = ½11 + AG°'/X] 
(26) 
In a number of systems a linear relationship 
between log k and log K with a slope of 0.4-0.6 is 
indeed observed (Table III). In systems encom- 
passing large driving forces plots of log k vs. log 
K are found to be curved as expected from Eqn. 
26. Often, however, they are essentially linear over 
the restricted driving force ranges usually used. An 
+ 
3+ 
example is the family of RuL 3 -Euaq reactions 
(different polypyridine ligands L) for which -AG O 
ranges from 1.2 to 1.5 eV, and which is predicted 
to have a slope of 0.28; the value observed (0.12) 
is, however, even smaller. The decreased slope has 
been ascribed to effects of nonadiabaticity [21,101]. 
Good correlation between log k and log K has 
been found for a broad variety of metalloprotein 
electron-transfer reactions [111].

1111). Mixed-valence systems 
Mixed-valence complexes in which two metal 
centers are connected by a bridging group provide 
systems that are very useful for the comparison of 
theoretical and experimental parameters. Not only 
are the theoretical problems associated with the 
formation of the precursor complex eliminated, 
but the distance separating the metal centers is 
also known. In addition, many mixed-valence sys- 
tems feature an intervalence absorption band in 
the near-infrared region of the spectrum and HAB, 
~i and Xo can be obtained from the intensity, 
energy and solvent dependence of this band 
[112,113]. 
The energy of the intervalenc¢ transition Eop is 
equal to h + AG o' [114] 7, whence the AG* in Eqn. 
In Refs. 112 and 113 Eop is assumed to be h + AE °, where 
AE ° is the internal energy change. However, in Ref. 114 the 
transition energy is shown to be a free-energy change 1~ + 
AG °'. The equality of Eop and ~ + G o' is evident from Eqn. 
14 of Ref. 114, where F~_P s - F~_g is the polar contribution 
to h and F c - F s is the polar contribution to AF ° (AG o' in 
the present notation). In more physical terms, the reason why 
Eop equals ~ + AG O' rather than h + AE °' can be seen from 
the following argument. According to the Franck-Condon 
principle, the momenta and positions of the nuclei do not 
change during the vertical transition. Consequently, the in- 
stantaneous distribution of momenta and coordinates is the 
same immediately before and just after the optical transition 
and there is no change in the entropy during the vertical 
transition (apart from entropy changes associated with 
changes in electronic multiplicity). Let the vertical transition 
energy E o be denoted by ~, when AG o' = 0. At AG o' = 0, we 
have AH b% = TAS °', and so Eop can be written equivalently 
as h + AH °'- TAS °'. If, now, the products' potential-energy 
surface is vertically displaced downward, AS °' is unchanged, 
but AH °' is made more negative. The Eop is now ~, plus this 
(negative) change in AH °'. In other words, when AG o' + 0, 
we can still write Eop as ~ + AH °' - TAS °', i.e., as h + AG °', 
as in the text. The ~, defined above can be related to the 
free-energy barrier in the thermal electron transfer as fol- 
lows: according to the key approximation made in deriving 
Eqns. 1 to 3, the free energy of each of the surfaces is a 
quadratic function (actually of a quantity m in Refs. 1-3), 
and it follows from this property that when AG o'= 0 the 
free-energy change for reaching the intersection is one fourth 
the free energy change for the vertical transition. Since, as we 
have already noted, there is no change in entropy during the 
vertical transition, the vertical change in free-energy equals 
that in energy, namely Eop. Thus, the free-energy barrier for 
the thermal transfer is Eop/4, i.e., h/4.

which is now absent)

with AG* given by Eqn. 2 or, for the present

(27d) 
4( Eop- AG °') 
and AS* then equals ½AS °' Eop/(Eop-AG°'). 
(AH* and AG* have been confused in certain 
applications involving Eop in the literature, and 
Eqn. 27d is new [115]. 
If the intervalence band has a Gaussian shape 
and the degree of ground-state delocalization is 
small, then HAS is related to the properties of the 
band by [112,113]:

where r is in nm and v in wavenumbers. At room 
temperature the energy and half-width of a Gaus- 
sian-shaped band (for the case AG O' = 0) are re- 
lated by Refs. 112 and 113 (cf.Ref. 114): 
\1/2 
A~q/2 = (2.31- 103 Pmax) 
cm-1 
(29) 
(When AG o' 4:0 the ~m~x in Eqn. 29 is replaced by 
~max - AGO', where AG o' is now in units of cm-1.) 
Consequently, the half-width can be eliminated 
from Eqn. 28 which then contains only r, Cm~x, 
and ~m~, as parameters. Another way of obtaining 
HAB is from EPR, namely from the singlet-triplet 
splitting of a radical pair [64,116,117]: such a 
method yields a value for the electron-transfer 
matrix element HAB when the splitting is predomi- 
nantly due to the presence of a singlet charge- 
transfer state [116,117]. The latter affects the en- 
ergy of the singlet, but not of the triplet, radical 
pair. 
The application of Eqns. 27a, 28 and 29 will be 
illustrated by considering the electron transfer 
within mixed-valence diruthenium systems. There 
is reasonable agreement between ~max (9.7" 103 
cm-a) for the 4,4'-bipyridine-bridged system and 
the value calculated (12.8.103 cm-1) using a model 
in which each half of the binuclear ion is ap- 
proximated by a sphere of radius 0.37 nm [96,118]. 
Similarly, the solvent dependence of the interva- 
lence band (slope of. Vmax vs. (1/Dop - 1/Ds) ) is 
only 30% smaller than the value calculated from 
Eop = h i q- )ko, 
(30) 
where )~i and )% are given by Eqns. 5 and 6, with 
a = 0.37 nm and r = 1.08 nm. The value of HAB 
calculated from the intensity of the intervalence 
band [119,120] is 400 cm -1, corresponding to x = 1. 
Introducing a -CH2-grou p between the two 
pyridine rings reduces the coupling of the metal 
centers, so that the electron transfer becomes 
somewhat nonadiabatic (~ = 0.2). Nevertheless, the 
coupling in the latter system is still very large 
compared with the through-space coupling of two 
ruthenium centers a distance 1.0-1.2 nm apart for 
which x = 10 -4 has been estimated as discussed 
above. 
In the Creutz-Taube ion [121] the two ruthenium 
centers are connected by a pyrazine group. This 
group provides strong electronic coupling .of the 
metal centers instead of weak coupling. The prop- 
erties of the pyrazine-bridged system are those 
expected for a delocalized rather than a localized 
ground state, (and so Eqn. 6 becomes inapplica- 
ble). The near-infrared band of the Creutz-Taube 
ion does not show the solvent dependence ex- 
pected for weak overlap intervalence systems and, 
in contrast to the band of the bipyridine-bridged 
system, the near-infrared band of the pyrazine- 
bridged complex is much narrower than predicted 
by Eqn. 29 [113]. This is an interesting system and 
the proper description of the Creutz-Taube ion is 
still a subject of debate [122]. A three-site elec- 
tronic-nuclear model has been discussed recently

----- Page 19 (native) -----
for such strongly delocalized bridged systems 
[123-125]. 
Although a bridging group is useful, it is not 
required for the observation of an intervalence 
absorption band: such bands are also observed in 
outer-sphere ion pairs and can be analyzed in 
terms of the above two-site formalism [126]. 
Experimental [127,128] and theoretical [71] 
studies of the dependence of absorption intensity 
of charge-transfer spectra on distance along fixed 
bridges have been described recently. A depen- 
dence of HAB on the coordinates (e.g., in Figs. 
1-4) has also been considered [129]. Such a depen- 
dence can cause the matrix elements for the ther- 
mally and optically induced electron transfer to 
differ [129]. However, when a realistic model is 
used instead of a delta function or a square-well 
potential, the difference between the matrix ele- 
ments becomes much smaller [71]. 
A phenomenon related to charge-transfer spec- 
tra is the photoionization of ions in solution 
[130,131]. The photoionization spectrum of each 
ion is related to the value of )~ plus the AG O for 
this process [131]. 
IllE. Electrode reactions 
There has been an extensive comparison of the 
self-exchange rates with the rates of the corre- 
sponding reactions at an electrode, determined at 
zero activation overpotential in order to test the 
relation predicted in Eqn. 11 (e.g., Refs. 17, 132,133 
contain recent summaries). There is a good corre- 
lation at lower rates, but at the highest rates the 
available data for the electrochemical rates appear 
to show a levelling-off. 
There have been experimental studies, e.g., cited 
in Appendix ID, of the theoretical analog [3,29-31] 
of Eqn. 26 for electrode reactions in which the 
activation overpotential ne (E - E~) replaces AG °'. 
(E is the half-cell potential, E~ the 'standard' 
half-cell potential in the prevailing medium, and n 
is the number of electrons, of charge e, transferred 
between reactant and electrode in the elementary 
step.) Recent studies of the curvature of plots of In 
k vs. E - E~ have also been made [134,135]. They 
yield approximate agreement of the theoretical 
and calculated E-E~ values for onset of signifi- 
cant deviation of a in Eqn. 26 from 0.5.

IV. Extension to biological electron transfers 
1VA. Similarities and differences with small mole- 
cule electron transfers 
We first note that biological electron transfers 
have certain features in common with the small 
molecule electron transfers, as well as features 
which are different. As in the simpler reactions, 
the reactants in biological systems can be expected 
to undergo vibrational and solvational (or environ- 
mental) changes during the reaction, and so the 
rates should depend on )~ and AG °. However, 
substantial differences also exist. (1) Whereas it 
was possible in the solution case to find self-ex- 
change reactions for predicting the rate of a cross- 
reaction, the former may sometimes not even exist 
in the biological case. (2) Whereas the structural 
information (bond length changes) needed for the 
prediction of absolute rate constants of self-ex- 
change reactions is becoming increasingly availa- 
ble in the case of reactions in solution (particularly 
with the introduction of EXAFS) as are the rele- 
vant vibrational frequencies, such information is at 
present only fragmentarily available for most bio- 
logical systems. Indeed, in some cases even the 
identity of all the coordinated ligands may not be 
known. (3) The environment (solvent) for the elec- 
tron-transfer reactions in solution, which affects 2~, 
is at present better known than that, for example, 
in protein systems, which are structurally less ho- 
mogeneous. (4) Whereas AG O is usually quite 
well-known for reactions in solution, knowledge of 
it for the case where the pair of reactants are either 
in, or attached to, a membrane is frequently less 
certain ¶ . (5) Quantities such as AG O now become 
dependent on any electric field which has devel- 
oped across the membrane. (6) Protein-conforma- 
tional changes may precede or follow the electron 
transfer in biological systems. For example, such 
conformational changes may modify relative bind- 
ing free energy of the oxidized and the reduced 
Further, in applications of the theoretical expressions to an 
electron transfer step (both in a biological and a nonbiologi- 
cal reaction) one also needs to be particularly careful that the 
AG°used refers only to that step and hence that any experi- 
mental value is corrected, when necessary, for any loss or 
gain of protons.

forms of a substrate to the protein. (7) Whereas 
most electron-transfer reactions in solution are 
expected to occur at or near contact between the 
reactants, with a reaction probability which de- 
pends on ~, and AG °, reactants in a biological 
membrane are frequently fixed in position, and so 
are prevented from coming in contact. (In this 
respect the biological reactants are similar to those 
in long range non-biological intramolecular elec- 
tron-transfer reactions.) Their rate is expected to 
vary roughly as exp (-fir), i.e., to decrease ex- 
ponentially with separation distance r of the re- 
actants and the rate now depends not only on the 
intrinsic (~,) and thermodynamic (AG °) factors, 
but also on fl and on the mutual orientation of the 
reactants. It also depends on r through the outer 
(~'0) contribution to h. Thereby, fl and r become 
important parameters for any proper understand- 
ing of the rates. 
Before proceeding to a discussion of some in- 
dividual reactions, we first consider one general 
aspect of biological electron transfers: they often 
occur via a series of intermediates at fixed sites, 
for example in the charge transfer across a mem- 
brane for the photosynthetic reaction center 
(subsection VD). There are at least two factors 
which influence the choice of a mechanism involv- 
ing several reaction intermediates versus one in- 
volving a single giant step. To illustrate these 
factors we consider a simple example of a system 
abc with one intervening site b. For transfer to 
occur in one hop (e.g., for mediation by b to occur 
via a superexchange mechanism without a well-de- 
fined intermediate b- being formed), there is first 
a reorganization of the nuclear configuration of 
the end sites a and c, to make their energies equal, 
the system thereby reaching the intersection region 
in Fig. 1. The vertical energy difference of site b 
and end sites a and c is denoted by V. Hab ¢ is the 
effective electronic matrix element coupling a and 
c and in a superexchange mechanism (Appendix 
IC) equals HabHbc/V , when V>> nab and Hbc §. 
§ This result, which is used here for illustrative purposes only, 
applies when there is only one orbital per bridge. In general, 
there is a sum of these HabHbc/V terms over the orbitals of 
the bridge, and Hab, Hbc and V vary with the bridge orbital 
g. See, for example, Eqn. 15 of Ref. 70, where Hab = ~hcl~, 
H~ = ~2cn~ and V = b~ - a, in the notation of Ref. 70. 
The site b poses little additional barrier only when 
Hbc/V is not too small, and the transfer then 
occurs in a single hop. A single hop has the 
advantage for a downhill reaction of utilizing in 
full the overall -AG O' , typically then requiring 
less reorganization free energy in the normal re- 
gion, in accordance with Eqns. 1-3. On the other 
hand, when HbJ V is very small, the transfer will 
occur in two successive hops provided that the 
formation Of an actual intermediate b- is not too 
'uphill'. The matrix element for the first hop is 
now Hab, and is Hb~ for the second hop. The 
-AG O" for at least one of these hops is now less 
favorable than the overall -AG O" , and so may 
require a somewhat larger free energy of reorgani- 
zation. Thus, the actual choice of mechanism de- 
pends on the relative contributions of the AG O' 
and HbJ V factors discussed above. 
IVB. Reorganization parameters 
We next examine how the equations of Section 
II might be modified so as to treat reactions of 
metalloproteins, for instance those between cy- 
tochrome c and various inorganic redox reagents. 
In applying Eqns. 1-4 the detailed description of 
the ~'o and h i contributions to the biological 
system (cytochrome c in the present case) may 
differ from those for the ions in solution, and the 
magnitude of ~¢ becomes a particularly important 
question if there is an appreciable distance be- 
tween the two electron-transfer sites. There may 
also be contributions to w or Xi arising from 
conformational changes. 
The geometry of most metalloproteins, particu- 
larly as regards the dielectric situation, differs 
from that used to derive Eqn. 6 (although one 
might use Eqn. 6 with some mean D s for the 
protein and/or 
membrane system). A 
more 
elaborate model to calculate h o [137] can, of 
course, be introduced. In the present article we 
explore the possibility of using Eqns. 1-3. This we 
do in Section V, by first exploring the applicability 
of the cross-relation, Eqn. 10. Eqn. 2 has been 
used for cytochrome c recently (apart from w r) 
[137]. The authors made an estimate of the re- 
organization parameter ~ (Eqn. 4) using a molecu- 
lar model for the protein [137]. Electron transfer 
between most reactants in biological systems oc-

----- Page 21 (native) -----
curs between spatially fixed and oriented sites. In 
this case the reaction is formally a first-order one. 
The first-order rate constant k can then be written 
as 
k = K(r)v exp(-AG*/RT) 
(31) 
(32) 
where h again equals h i + h o, AG* and AG O' are 
the free energy barrier and the free energy of 
reaction, respectively, when the reactants are a 
distance r apart in the prevailing medium, and v 
has dimensions of a frequency (s-1). In the adia- 
batic regime I, is an effective frequency for nuclear 
motion along the reaction coordinate in Fig. 1 
(discussed in Appendix I). In the nonadiabatic 
regime (~¢ << 1), x~, is actually independent of the 
frequency of nuclear motion: comparison of Eqn. 
31 with Eqn. 17 shows that when x << 1, x~ is 
given by: 
HA2B 
K(r)~, = 2rr 
(33a) 
h (4~rhRT) 1/2 
As discussed later H2B decreases exponentially 
with separation distance for many systems and so 
we shall w~ite ~(r)v as 
x(r)7, = 1.1013 exp[-fl(r - r0) ] S -1 
(33b) 
where r 0 is the value of r at which ~I, equals some 
preassigned value, 1 • 1013 s-1. Some experimental 
results in nonbiological systems place fl at about 
12 nm -1 for aromatic molecules, and perhaps less 
if one of the states is electronically excited (cf. 
Section IVC). The values of fl are likely to vary 
from system to system somewhat, depending, for 
example, on the vertical ionization potential of the 
redox site and its determination for various model 
systems, for reactions of ground states, electroni- 
cally excited states, anions, and cations, and its 
dependence on the intervening material present a 
central experimental problem in this field. 
If the frequency for motion of the nuclei along 
the reaction coordinate is 1.1013 s -1, a typical 
vibrational frequency, then in using Eqns. 31-33, 
285 
one is tacitly assuming that the reaction is 'adia- 
batic' at the separation distance r -- r 0, specifically 
that when r =r 0 the system moves from the R to 
the P surface upon every passage through the 
nuclear configuration defining the intersection re- 
gion in Fig. 1 (cf Appendix IA). Strictly speaking, 
the K in Eqn. 33 need not immediately fall ex- 
ponentially with r for r >_ r0: there could be some 
small interval for r, for which K is roughly con- 
stant and then the r(r) changes smoothly to an 
approximately exponential decrease with r. In bi- 
molecular reactions the separation distance where 
the reaction is adiabatic is frequently assumed to 
correspond to close contact of the two reactants. 
For membrane-bound systems the AG O' which 
appears in Eqn. 32 is for the conditions prevailing 
in the membrane and as such, can vary with the 
nearby charges present and with the electric fields 
they produce. If the electric field produces a given 
potential ~kA at the charge center A and ~ka at 
charge center B, then AG o' can be written as [24]: 
AGO'= AGO + AeA(~kB -- ~kn), 
(34) 
where Ae A is the (positive) charge transferred from 
site A to site B. This equation presupposes that 
there is no significant change of the potential 
itself when the electron transfer occurs. AG ° is the 
value of AG o' in the absence of ~k. 
Eqns. 31-33 have a number of applications. 
For example, one may vary AG o' by systematically 
varying one of the reactants. If h also varies, then 
an estimate of its variation is also needed (e.g., 
from self-exchange data). We discuss examples for 
bimolecular reactions in Section VA. 
A second application is to the activation energy 
E a of a first-order reaction. EJR is defined as the 
slope of the In k vs. 1/T plot, i.e., it equals - 0 In 
k/O(1/T). From Eqns. 27b, 31 and 32, E a for a 
first-order reaction is therefore given approxi- 
mately by: 
E a = An* --- ~- + 
1 + -- 
4h 
(35) 
when h and rv are assumed independent of tem- 
peraturel In the normal region the magnitude of

----- Page 22 (native) -----
286 
AG°'/~ in Eqn. 35 is less than unity. We see that 
when A H °' is very negative, the activation energy 
can even be negative. We have discussed elsewhere 
[60] such an application of Eqn. 35. 
The first-order rate constant k can be written 
as 
k = A' exp( - EJRT), 
(36a) 
where E~ is given by Eqn. 35. Using Eqns. 31 and 
35 the preexponential factor A' is given by 
A'= x(r)p exp( AS*/RT), 
(36b) 
where AS* is obtained from the thermodynamic 
relation, Eqn. 27c (with r subscripts). 
It is sometimes useful in discussions to intro- 
duce a term, the 'entropy of activation' AS t, which 
includes both AS* and an entropic contribution 
from xu, namely ¶ R ln(A'/1013), where A' is in 
s- 1. Thereby, 
AS* = AS* + ln(Kv/1013), 
(36c) 
where Kp is in s -1. Using Eqns. 27c, 32 and 35, 
AS* can be related to AS °', the standard entropy 
of reaction when the reactants are a distance r 
apart in the prevailing medium, namely (AH °'- 
AG°')/T, as follows: 
AS? = ½AS°'(1 + AG°'/a) 
(36d) 
Eqn. 36c and d are applied later. 
We shall have occasion to refer to the 'barrier- 
less regime', namely the region where AG O' is 
sufficiently negative that -AG O'--- ~,. In this case, 
one sees from Eqns. 32, 35 and, with r subscripts, 
27c that AG*, AH* and AS* are each approx. 
zero. In particular, the activation energy E~ is 
approx, zero. (This point is also discussed in Ap- 
pendix II.) 
In the case of bimolecular reactions it is con- 
A closely related definition of an 'entropy of activation' is 
frequently used in the literature. For example, the A' in Eqn. 
36a is often equated to (kBT/h) exp(ASt/R)i where k B is 
Boltzmann's constant. However, since kaT/h is approxi- 
mately 1.1013 s -1 at room temperature, this definition is 
equivalent to that used in the text for reactions studied under 
typical conditions. 
venient to use a formalism for the rate constant 
based on the fixed site first-order rate constant k 
in Eqn. 36a and a pre-equilibrium constant K A for 
a precursor complex, described in Appendix I and 
used in Section V. 
IVC. Electron tunneling barriers. Distance depen- 
dence of electron-transfer rate in nonbiological sys- 
tems 
We next present a brief description of de- 
terminations of fl in Eqn. 33 from nonbiological 
data. Several methods have been used: 
(1) The first is based on the study of electron- 
transfer reactions in frozen media. Initially, there 
is a random distribution of the reactants. Since the 
closer pairs react first, the subsequent distribution 
is no longer random: consistent with Eqn. 33 the 
pairs at a distance r have a rate constant k(r) 
given by 
k( r ) = k o exp[-fl(r- r0) ] 
(37a) 
Using an expression for the fraction of pairs re- 
maining at time t and at each r and then integrat- 
ing over r, an expression for the fraction of unre- 
acted material at time t is obtained. Fitting the 
experimental data to the expression yields values 
of k 0 and of ft. In many reactions between solvated 
electrons and various acceptors fl varied between 
10 and 20 nm-1 (data not listed in Table IV, but 
summarized in Ref. 138). In electron-transfer reac- 
tions of biphenyl anions with some aromatic mole- 
cules [139], the anions being formed by pulse 
radiolysis, fl was calculated [138] from the data, 
and is given in the Table. Results for other systems 
are also given in Ref. 138, and most recently in 
Ref. 37 where a value of fl = 12 nm -1 has been 
obtained (Table IV). Studies of hole transfer in 
frozen media were also reported [141], namely 
from pyrene + and biphenyl + to tetramethylen- 
ephenylenediamine (cf. Table IV). 
(2) Monolayers of fatty acids have been de- 
posited on an aluminum layer, and then another 
metal layer deposited to form a capacitor, cf. [147] 
and references cited therein. Conductivities were 
measured for monolayers of fatty-acid salts con- 
taining 14-23 carbon atoms, the second metal 
being mercury [143], magnesium [144], gold [144],

or aluminum [145]. The results for /3 were 15 
nm -1, apart from that for magnesium (/3= 10 
nm -1) and are included in Table IV. Analogous 
studies with multilayers [144] gave a value 10.5-15 
(only a few points however), consistent with the 
monolayer studies if hopping between traps sep- 
arated by the monolayers was assumed. Photocon- 
duction experiments performed in multilayered 
structures dyes and fatty acids gave a smaller 
/3--3-5 nm -1 [146]. A similarly small /3 was 
obtained in fluorescence quenching experiments in 
which a layer of dye and a layer of acceptor were 
separated by a fatty-acid monolayer [147], and in 
photoconduction experiments in which a (semi- 
transparent) aluminum layer was separated from 
an anthracene crystal [148] or a chloranil crystal 
[149] by a fatty acid monolayer. Thus, /3 appears 
to be smaller when one of the reactants is electron- 
ically excited. (There is a smaller barrier in Fig. 2b 
then.) 
(3) Particularly interesting are intramolecular 
electron-transfer rate measurements in which the 
separation distance is varied. In an experiment in 
which aromatic reactants are separated from each 
other by a steroid molecule, at an edge-to-edge 
separation distance of about 1.0 nm the electron 
transfer for the most exothermic reaction occurred 
in less than 0.5 ns [142]. Using a value for k 0 of 
1 • 1013 s -1 and AG* = 0 yields fl < 10 nm -1, while 
k 0 = 1 • 1014 s-1 yields fl < 12 nm-i. 
Summarizing these results we see that the value 
of the/3 in Eqn. 37a for the aromatic systems in 
Table IV is about 11-12 nm-1, is higher when the 
transfer is from metals, and is less in both cases 
when photoexcited systems are involved. Inciden- 
tally, a flash photolysis study of electron transfer 
from an excited zinc porphyrin to a quinone ring 
bound a distance r of 
~ 1.0 nm above the 
porphyrin plane yielded k -- 1 • 109 s- 1 [150], while 
the maximum calculated k assuming fl = 12 nm-t, 
r - r 0 = 0.7 nm (see below) and k 0 = 1 • 1013 s -t 
(and AG* = 0) is about 1 • 109 s-1. Clearly, further 
studies, including temperature dependences, are 
very desirable, and data for metalloprotein, poly- 
peptide and other porphyrin systems are becoming 
available [38,151-156]. 
A rough interpretation of fl is in terms of 
electron tunneling through a square potential bar- 
tier, e.g., Ref. 143. (A more satisfactory model is 
discussed in Appendix IC.) Using a standard 
quantum-mechanical tunneling formula, fl equals 
(2/h)(2mVo) 1/2, where m is the mass of the elec- 
tron, V 0 the height of the potential barrier (Fig. 2) 
and h is h/2~r. Values of/3 of 11 and 15 nm -1

----- Page 24 (native) -----
288 
correspond to V 0 values of 1.1 and 2.1 eV, respec- 
tively. The V 0 is, in effect, a vertical ionization 
energy to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital 
in the medium spanning the two redox centers, for 
the case where the nuclear configuration corre- 
sponds to the intersection region in Figs. 1 and 2. 
(Alternatively, it may be the corresponding quan- 
tity for a 'hole' [63].) The value of 14.4 nm -1 
proposed for fl in Ref. [63] was based on an 
assumed barrier of 2 eV. 
Strictly speaking, the pre-exponential factor k 0 
in Eqn. 37a for a site-to-site electron transfer is 
also expected to have some polynomial depen- 
dence on 1/r, because of a geometrical factor 
appearing in the overlap of the electronic wave- 
functions, see, e.g., Ref. 72. For the present pur- 
poses we shall regard this additional dependence 
on r as approximately included in the exponential 
factor. 
In addition to the electronic distance effect fir, 
there is another distance dependence which arises 
when the environment is a polar one, namely the 
increase of ~ with r, as in Eqn. 6: in the inverted 
region this additional effect causes the rate con- 
stant to increase initially with increasing r and 
then, because of the exponential decrease of the 
electronic factor with fir, to decrease [158]. The 
dependence of X on r can cause a wrong value of 
fl to be inferred from data on the distance depen- 
dence of intramolecular rate constants, unless al- 
lowance is made for it. 
We next adapt Eqn. 33a to nonspherical mole- 
cules, such as the porphyrins occurring in biologi- 
cal systems. Structural information is normally 
given in terms of distances between atomic nuclei. 
However, a distance of particular interest for elec- 
tron transfer is the distance between the closest 
atoms (of the two reactants) that are strongly 
coupled to their respective redox sites. When this 
distance is small enough rv equals some preas- 
signed value, taken earlier as 1 • 1013 s -1. Eqn. 33b 
can then be rewritten as 
toy = 1" 1013 exp(-,Sd) s -1, 
(37b) 
where d is equal to the actual separation of the 
centers of the two closest (in the case of aromatics) 
carbon atoms of the two reactants minus some 
amount to allow for the extension of the ~r-elec- 
tronie'orbitals beyond the carbon nuclei. For con- 
creteness we will use a value of 0.3 nm for the 
latter amount. (Thereby, if the frequency of mo- 
tioh' along the reaction coordinate were about 1. 
1013 s -1, the reaction would be adiabatic (r = 1) 
when these aromatic carbons are a distance 0.3 nm 
or less apart.) The value of rv also depends, of 
course, on the detailed geometry (e.g., Appendix 
IA), such as mutual orientation of the reactants, 
but for the present purpose we focus attention on 
the distance of closest approach. 
IVD. Work terms for bimolecular reactions involv- 
ing metalloproteins 
There have been a number of studies of the 
effect of ionic strength on the rates of electron 
transfer between metalloproteins and metal com- 
plexes [159-167]. The charges on the reactants are 
varied in these studies by using metal complexes of 
different charge types and/or by varying the 
charges on the protein through pH variations or 
by modifying the protein. The results are fre- 
quently interpreted by approximating the metal- 
loprotein by a sphere and calculating its radius 
either from the partial specific volume of the pro- 
tein in aqueous solution or from crystallographic 
data. In this model the charge of the protein is 
assumed to be uniformly distributed, and is calcu- 
lated from the amino acid composition; this charge 
is then compared with the value calculated from 
the ionic strength dependence of the rate con- 
stants. 
Use of Eqn. 25 for the electrostatic work re- 
quired to bring together a metalloprotein and a 
metal complex (or two metalloproteins) yields Eqn. 
38 for the ionic strength dependence of the rate 
constant ¶:

According to Eqns. 1-3 the ionic strength/t affects k via the 
work terms w r and w p and via AG °. The latter depends on p 
because properties of the medium do. When I AG°'/X[ is

where k is the rate constant at infinite dilution, 
o12 is the center-to-center separation of the two 
reactants, and o 1 and o 2 are defined as for Eqn. 
25. In using Eqn. 38 simplifying assumptions for 
o I and o 2 are often made: (i) o12 = ol + 02 with 
o~ = a~ + 0.15 nm [172] or (ii) o12 = o 1 + o 2 with 
o~ = a~ [163,169-171]. The results obtained upon 
fitting the kinetic data to Eqn. 38 using the as- 
sumption (ii) and a least-squares routine in which 
and the total charge on the protein are allowed 
to vary are summarized in Table V. Included in 
Table V are the protein charges calculated from 
the amino-acid composition. The results are seen 
to be in satisfactory agreement, except for the 
result reported for the reaction of steUacyanin with 
Co(phen) 3+, which apparently exhibits no ionic 
strength dependence § 
In another approach to ionic strength effects 
[172-175], it is assumed that the transition state of 
the reaction (denoted by AB*) can be regarded as 
a single body rather than a pair of reactants. The 
rate constant can then be written as in Eqn. 39 
using transition state theory 
k = ~:'tA~'a/VAa* 
(39) 
where "/A, "YB and ~/AB* denote the activity coeffi- 
cients of A, B and AB*. The quantity "/AB* is 
assumed to be the activity coefficient of a sphere 
of radius o12 and total charge (z I + z2). (Eqn. 39 
was, in effect, obtained prior to transition state 
theory by Bronsted.) Expressing these activity 
coefficients in terms of Debye-Hackel theory, one 
obtains: 
small, the dependence of In k on/~ is found from Eqns. 1-3 
to be 
- 
1 
In k = In k + "~--~(wr + wP) - lIn(~/l°X'lF2red/)'lred~x ) 
for the case of reaction 7, where the ,/'s denote activity 
coefficients. For self-exchange reactions w r equals w v, the 
activity coefficient ratio becomes unity, and use of Eqn. 25 
then leads to Eqn. 38, where now o I = o 2. An equation more 
general than Eqn. 38 and arising from the above expression 
for In k is given In the Appendix as Eqn. 60.

to the presence of undefined amounts of carbohydrates in the 
preparation of the protein [159].

In Eqns. 1-3, and thereby in Eqn. 38 and in Eqn. 
60 of the Appendix, the interaction of the re- 
actants A and B is treated as outer-sphere-like, i.e., 
they do not coalesce. For Eqn. 40, on the other 
hand, A and B are bound closely enough (or, 
instead, one ion is very small relative to the other) 
that they have in effect coalesced to form a sphere. 
In general, Eqns. 38 and 40 yield fairly similar 
results [170,172-175]: the difference between the 
expressions tends to become more marked at high 
ionic strengths, but Debye-Hiackel-type theory also 
tends to break down under those conditions. The 
breakdown can be expected to be greatest for 
reactants of opposite charge because of specific 
ionic interactions [-176], a point also noted later. 
Eqns. 38 and 40 both assume that each reactant 
(and, in the case of Eqn. 40, AB* also) is spherical 
and has a uniform charge distribution. When the 
charge distribution on a reactant is asymmetric, as 
is the case for most proteins, the departure from 
spherical symmetry has been modelled by intro- 
ducing dipole (and higher order) interactions. In 
recent applications, Eqn. 38 has been corrected by 
adding an ion-dipole interaction energy to the 
ion-ion interaction energy (Eqn. 25) [174-177], 
while Eqn. 40 has been corrected by using the 
Kirkwood expression for the activity coefficient of 
a charged dipole, which involves adding another 
term [172] to the Debye-Hhckel term. Use of these 
expressions requires information about the dipole 
moment of the protein. 
The dipole moment of cytochrome c has been 
calculated to be --300 Debye [173]. For ionic 
strengths below 0.1 M, this dipole moment hardly

makes any contribution to the ionic strength de- 
pendence of the rate, but at ionic strengths above 
0.4 M the ionic strength dependence is mainly 
determined by the dipole interaction [174,175]. 
(The ion-ion interaction varies as the ~ 
while the 
ion-dipole interaction varies as ~t.) If the charge on 
cytochrome c is + 8, then the maximum correc- 
tion, regardless of the ionic strength, to the charge 
on the protein was found to be +3, the exact 
value depending on the cosine of the angle be- 
tween the protein dipole and the interaction site 
on the protein surface [174,175]. 
In certain applications good agreement with the 
experimental ionic strength dependence has been 
obtained when the charge and radius of the pre- 
sumed electron transfer site, rather than the total 
protein charge and radius, have been substituted 
into Eqns. 38 or 40 [166], or into more complex 
expressions [177]. In other applications the effec- 
tive charge on the protein has been calculated 
from the ionic strength dependence of the binding 
of small anions or cations using the Bjerrum ex- 
pression for the ion-pair formation constants. This 
procedure yielded good agreement between the 
effective charge and the charge of the binding site 
calculated from the protein structure [178], indicat- 
ing that the binding constants in the systems 
studied are determined by the local rather than by 
the total protein charge (see discussion in Appen- 
dix IB). 
In some cases the good agreement with the 
experimental data found with one model or another 
may be fortuitous, particularly if the local charge 
has the same sign and happens to be of similar 
magnitude to the total protein charge. This is the 
case, for example, with horse-heart cytochrome 
c - the total charge on the oxidized protein is + 8 
and the exposed heme edge (believed to be the 
electron transfer site, subsection VA) is sur- 
rounded by a ring of four positively charged amino 
acids. In the case of bean plastocyanin, the total 
charge of the oxidized protein is -8, while the 
electron-transfer site for the reaction of plasto- 
cyanin with negatively charged complexes is be- 
lieved to be uncharged; nevertheless, the ionic 
strength dependence of the reactions of plasto- 
cyanin with Fe(EDTA) 2- [171] and Fe(CN)6 a- 
[166] is consistent with reaction with a negatively 
charged protein. Presumably in these systems the 
approach of the negatively charged complex is 
influenced by the protein charge nearest the elec- 
tron-transfer site, which is a negatively charged 
region in the case of plastocyanin (discussed fur- 
ther in subsection VF), even though the presumed 
electron transfer site itself is uncharged. On the 
other hand, cytochrome f is an example of a

----- Page 27 (native) -----
protein in which the charge on the binding site, as 
deduced from the effect of ionic strength on the 
reaction rate, is of opposite sign to the total pro- 
tein charge [179]. 
As a general rule one expects that the total 
protein charge will dominate the electrostatic in- 
teractions at large reactant separations, with the 
local protein charge becoming more important as 
the separation distance decreases. The 'cross-over' 
distance will depend upon the detailed charge 
distribution of the protein and is difficult to 
calculate, although some progress in modeling the 
electrostatic interactions is being made [177,180]. 
(In some systems, hydrophobic interactions may 
have to be included.) The results of recent calcu- 
lations [177,180] for the reactions of a variety of 
c-type cytochromes support the view that a local- 
ized region of the cytochrome c surface is prim- 
arily responsible for the observed electrostatic in- 
teractions. This site is identified with the exposed 
heme region, an interpretation that is consistent 
with the results of other studies. These are de- 
scribed in the next section. 
V. Applications to biological electron transfers 
VA. Reactions of cytochrome c with metal complexes 
The reactions of cytochrome c with metal com- 
plexes form an interesting bridge between the in- 
organic electron-transfer reactions in solution and 
purely biological electron transfers. Accordingly, 
we begin this section with a discussion of cyto- 
chrome c reactions and some of the relevant the- 
ory. 
291 
Cytochrome c is probably the best char- 
acterized metalloprotein [181-183]. The heme 
group lies in a crevice of the protein and is cova- 
lently bonded to the protein by thioether bridges. 
The iron atom is situated in the plane of the 
porphyrin ring with the fifth and sixth coordina- 
tion sites occupied by a ring nitrogen atom of 
His-18 and the sulfur atom of Met-80. An im- 
portant feature of the cytochrome structure is that 
an edge of the porphyrin ring is located at the 
surface of the metalloprotein. 
The rates of electron transfer between cyto- 
chrome c and a large number of metal complexes 
have been studied. The complexes used are sub- 
stitution inert, ensuring an outer-sphere mecha- 
nism, 
and 
have 
known 
self-exchange rates 
[95,96,184-187] and redox potentials (Table VI). 
Some of the complexes are positively charged, 
others negatively charged; some are hydrophobic 
(e.g., Co(phen)3+/2+), and others hydrophilic (e.g., 
Ru(NH3)3+/2+). 
The benzimidazole- and the 
pyridine-pentaammineruthenium complexes pro- 
vide a large, aromatic ligand for probing hydro- 
phobic protein regions such as the heme crevice. 
The rate constants for the reactions are sum- 
marized in Table VII, which also includes the 
values calculated from Eqn. 42, a common ap- 
proximation to the cross-relation, Eqn. 10:

constants for the metal complexes given in Table 
VI, were used. The 14,'12 correction, which was not 
used, is also given, and is seen in the table to be 
close to unity, except for the reaction of ferricy- 
tochrome c with the negatively charged reactants 
Fe(EDTA) 2- and Co(ox)33 -, for which W12 ~ 9 
and W t2 ~ 15, respectively. 
The agreement of the observed and calculated 
exchange rates in Table VII is seen to be good 
(apart 
from 
that 
for 
the 
reactions 
with 
Fe(EDTA) 2- and Co(ox)~- when WI2 is included). 
The simplest explanation is that cytochrome c 
uses the same electron-transfer pathway with metal 
complexes as it does in its self-exchange reaction, 
and that this pathway is the exposed heme edge. 
Additional support for this mechanism has re- 
cently been obtained from protein modification 
studies [195]. One sees that there is no special rate 
enhancement 
with 
Ru(NH3)sBzlm 2+ 
or 
Ru(NH3)spy 3+ ascribable to penetration of the 
heme crevice by the ~conjugated ligand (Table 
VIII). This last result is in contrast to an earlier 
conclusion [190], which was based on the use of 
too small an exchange rate constant for the 
Ru(NH3)spy 3+/2+ couple. The reaction of ferro- 
cytochrome c with Co(ox) 3- is reasonably well- 
behaved at the high ionic strength (0.5 M) used for 
the studies. This is not the case for the reaction of 
cytochrome c with ferro- and ferricyanide. There 
have been numerous studies of the latter reaction, 
and although rate saturation behavior has been 
reported at high concentrations of the complex, 
that interpretation is complicated by the need for 
corrections for specific ion interactions as well as 
for the reversibility of the reaction [196,197] ¶. At 
this time there appears to be no good example of 
rate saturation in the electron transfer reactions of 
cytochrome c with metal complexes [197,198]. A 
report [199] that the Fe(CN)~--ferricytochrome c 
system exhibits an intervalence absorption band 
has also been shown to be erroneous: the observed 
band was due to Prussian-blue type impurities 
[201]. 
VB. The cytochrome c self-exchange reaction 
The cross-reaction studies discussed above are 
dearly consistent with the cytochrome c self-ex- 
change rate of approx. 1 • 103 M -1 • s -1 at 0.1 M 
ionic strength determined by NMR [193]. In this 
section we interpret this rate constant in terms of 
the quantities introduced in Section II. 
In terms of the model, the cytochrome c self-ex- 
change rate constant is given by (Appendix IB) 
k = SKAKP exp 4RT 
(43) 
~1 The redox potential and self-exchange rate of Fe(CN)36 -/4- 
couple is highly medium-dependent [187] and this couple is 
therefore not a good choice for cross-reaction studies.

where ~=)k i + h o. A steric factor S has been 
introduced to allow for the fact that the cyto- 
chrome c molecule is not spherically symmetric, at 
least so far as the angular dependence of the 
electron-transfer probability is concerned. The 
quantity SK A is the equilibrium constant for for- 
mation of a precursor complex A-B in which the 
active sites of A and B are in contact (Appendix 
IB). 
We consider the various factors appearing in 
Eqn. (43): if it is assumed that the electron-trans- 
fer reactions of cytochrome c proceed through the 
exposed, but recessed heme edge, then a lower 
limit for the steric factor for the exchange is equal 
to the square of the ratio of the surface area of the 
exposed heme edge to the surface area of the 
whole molecule [22]. Cytochrome c is a prolate 
spheroid approximately 2.5 × 2.5 × 3.7 nm in size, 
corresponding to a surface area of 26 nm 2. The 
effective area of the heme crevice is about 0.5 × 1.8 
nm [200]; accordingly, the heme edge occupies 
about 3% of the surface of the molecule. We shall 
tentatively adopt a vlaue of 0.01 for S in subse- 
quent calculations ~. The K A for this large system 
(o = 2.84 nm) is estimated with Eqns. 25 and 57 to 
be approx. 1 M-1. As before, Eqn. 37b of Section 
IVC is used for xv. 
Mixing of the t2g-orbitals of the Fe center in 
cytochrome c with the ~r*-orbitals of the porphyrin 
ring effectively extends the metal d-electron den- 
sity to the porphyrin edge, so that facile electron 
transport to and from the iron center via the 
exposed heme edge should be possible. However, 
this does not mean that the exchange reaction will 
be adiabatic ~, i.e., that K -~ 1. The 'exposed' edge 
of the heme group of cytochrome ¢ is surrounded 
by folds in the polypeptide chain: these folds may 
In general, it is necessary to integrate k(r) over all mutual 
orientations and distances of the reacting pair. We adopt a 
simplified model in which the electron transfer through the 
remainder of the protein molecule may be neglected in 
comparison with the rate through the heme edge. Because of 
electron transfer from other angles the actual S is expected 
to be closer to unity than the square of the ratio of effective 
areas (0.03) 2 and we have adopted the value of 0.01. 
o Nor does the fact that the cross-reactions satisfy Eqn. 42 
require that the exchange reaction be adiabatic; Eqn. 42 will 
still be satisfied provided ~12 "~ (KI1K22) 1/2 or, more gener- 
ally, provided that $12K12 ~ (SuS::~Hs22) 1/2 [22]. 
prevent the close (edge-to-edge) approach of the 
hemes required for K ~ 1. Computer modeling 
(Weber, P.C. (1984) personal communication to 
Sutin, N) of the approach of two cytochrome c 
molecules reveals that the heme groups are able to 
approach closest in a co-planar configuration. Two 
such complexes, in which the His-18 residues are 
cis and trans, respectively, relative to the Fe-Fe 
axis, are shown in Fig. 9. In these complexes the 
heme edge-to-edge (carbon-carbon) separation is 
0.94 nm and the iron-iron distance is 1.77 nm. 
(Interestingly, this value is close to that found for 
two similarly docked cytochromes, 1.6 nm, in an 
independent study- 
an 
X-ray structure de- 
termination of a photosynthetic reaction center 
discussed in subsection VD.) Although there are 
more short heme-heme distances in the cis com- 
plex, this advantage is offset by the lower electro- 
static repulsion in the trans complex. By move- 
ment of the side chains of the surface amino acids 
the separation of the heme groups can be de- 
creased from 0.94 nm to approx. 0.9 nm, but 
cannot readily be reduced much further (Weber, 
P.C. (1984) personal communication to Sutin, N.). 
For purposes of calculation, we use the former 
value for the heme edge-to-edge (carbon-to-carbon) 
separation in the cytochrome c exchange, and use 
the 0.3 nm correction discussed in subsection IVB 
to obtain an electron-transfer distance d of 0.64 
nm. With this value of d and fl= 12 nm -1, a 
value of rv --- 5 • 109 s- 1 would be estimated s 
Next we consider the values of )~i and )%. 
X-ray crystallographic studies (0.18 nm resolution) 
indicate minimal differences between the struc- 
tures of the heme group in oxidized and reduced 
cytochrome c [181,182]. A crystal of ferricyto- 
chrome c (but not of ferrocytochrome c) contains 
two molecules per unit cell: the average Fe to 
Alternative electron-transfer pathways are not considered. 
For example, mediation by the sulfur atoms of Cys-14 and 
Cys-17, which are covalently bonded to the exposed heme 
edge, could be important [202]. In this regard the sulfur 
atom of Cys-17 is particularly well-situated (Fig. 9) and 
extended Hi~ckel calculations (Hanson, L.R. (1984) personal 
communication to Sutin, N.) indicate that the Fe electron 
density on the cysteinyl sulfurs may be comparable to that 
on the heme-edge carbon atoms. Mediation by the sulfur 
would decrease the effective d and increase Kv.

pyrrole-N distances in the two molecules are 0.208 
+ 0.011 and 0.203 + 0.011 nm, while in ferrocyto- 
chrome c this distance is 0.206 + 0.007 nm; the Fe 
to His-18N distance is 0.196 + 0.011 and 0.204 + 
0.011 nm in the two ferricytochrome c molecules 
and 0.197 + 0.007 nm in the reduced molecule, 
while the Fe to Met-80S distance is 0.228 + 0.005 
nm and 0.226 + 0.005 nm in the two oxidized 
molecules and 0.232 + 0.003 nm in the reduced 
molecule [182]. Although the iron-ligand distances 
in the two oxidation states appear to be similar the 
uncertainty is too large to permit a good estimae 
of ~ki/4, the reorganization energy arising from 
changes in the metal ligand bond distances. A 
small value of )~i/4 (approx. 4-8 kJ-mo1-1) is 
suggested by the rapid self-exchange rates of free 
(i.e., without bound protein) low-spin § hemes in 
solution, and is not inconsistent with the X-ray 
data. This value of )k i for a pair of cytochromes is 
also consistent with the Stokes shift (8 k J- mol-1) 
[204] for the low-frequency modes (200-500 cm-1 
range) that are coupled to the heme ~r-rr* transi- 
tion in a single ferrocytochrome c. (If these low- 
frequency modes provided the only contribution 
to X i for the self-exchange, such a Stokes shift 
would yield X i = 8 x 2 k J- mol-l). 
For the metalloprotein reactions there are, in 
general, two contributions to 2~o, one arising from 
the change in polarization (orientations of protein 
dipoles) of the polypeptide and the second from 
the change in polarization of the surrounding 
solvent. In general, the relative contributions to ~'o 
from these two sources will depend upon the na- 
ture of the particular metalloprotein. For cyto- 
chrome c, the contributions of the reorientation of 
the protein dipoles and of the surrounding water 
molecules to X o (for the pair of cytochrome re- 
actants) have been calculated from a microscopic 
model to be 10 and 12 kJ. mo1-1, respectively, 
and )~i was estimated to be 4 kJ- mo1-1 [137]. The 
resulting value of 6.5 k J- mol- 1 for X/4 seems too 
low. An alternative approach would be to assume 
that the protein/water surrounding the heme can 
be treated as a continuous dielectric with D s = 10 
and n 2= 2. If Eqn. 6 is then used with a, the

radius of the heme, equal to 0.5 nm and r, the 
iron-to-iron distance, equal to 1.8 nm, Xo/4 be- 
comes 20 kJ. mol-1. A total value of 25 kJ. mol-1 
for X/4 for the Cyt c-Cyt c self-exchange is 
consistent with the activation energy of 29 + 4 
kJ. mo1-1 at # = 1 M [193] * and will be assumed 
here, together with an S of 0.01 for that reaction 
and fl = 12 nm-1. Considering the complexities of 
the systems and the current uncertainties in their 
molecular parameters, a factor of ten difference in 
calculated and observed rates (which is equivalent 
to a change of 5.8 kJ-mo1-1 in the free-energy 
harrier) can be regarded as good agreement. 
The particular data which will be considered 
using the above values ~ of fl, S and X are: (a) the 
self-exchange rate constant of the cytochrome c 
system; (b) the self-exchange for the protein-free 
hemes; (c) the bimolecular electron transfer be- 
tween ferricytochrome c and Ru(NH3)sHis2+; (d) 
the intramolecular (NH3)sRuHis-Cyt c electron 
transfer, its small activation energy and its very 
negative entropy of activation; (e) the maximum 
bimolecular rate constant for electron transfer from 
Cyt c to various metal complexes; (f) the cy- 
tochrome c-chlorophyll dimer electron transfer in 
a photosynthetic reaction center; (g) the relative 
rates of the Cyt c-Cyt b 5 and Cyt c-Cyt c 
reactions; and (h) electron transfer between cy- 
tochrome c and a number of other metal- 
loproteins. The bulk of these results and several 
others are collected later in Table VIII.

M-l), 
~v(~ 5" 10 9 s -1) and 2~/4 (~ 25 kJ. 
mol-1), the self-exchange rate constant for cy- 
tochrome c is estimated from Eqn. 43 to be 10 -2. 
t The activation energy at ~t = 0.1 M is twice as large [193]; 
perhaps there is a large temperature-dependent salt effect at 
low ionic strengths. Debye-Hi~ckel type expressions appear to 
be more valid for calculating free energy changes (e.g., activ- 
ity coefficients or work terms) than for calculating their 
derivatives, such as entropies or energies (cf. results in Ref. 
76). 
Predicted results in Section V, such as the Cyt c-Cyt c 
self-exchange rate or the cross-reaction rate at small I AG°'/~ I 
do not depend on the individual values of S and h ($11 and 
~11), but only on the combination $11 exp (- ~11/4RT), [cf. 
Eqn. 43]. Predicted results such as an intramolecular electron 
transfer k or its activation energy depend on h11/2, but not 
on Sn, while the predicted k in the barrierless regime 
depends on S~( 2, but not on X n.

5.109 e -1° i.e., approx. 2.103 M-l-s -t. The 
experimental value is 1.2.103 M -1. s -1 [193]. 
The rate constant k for heme-heme self-ex- 
change is 1 • 106-1 • 101° M -1- s -1 depending on 
the nature of the axial ligands (through their effect 
on hi and ~'o) and the medium [205]. The value of 
~,o/4 for heme exchange will depend on the nature 
of the solvent, but is expected to be small because 
of the relatively large size of the heme group. The 
factor of more than 104 difference in the cy- 
tochrome c and free heme self-exchange rates is 
then primarily due to the extra separation distance 
between the hemes in the protein-protein case §. 
The large separation was estimated above the in- 
troduce a factor of 5 • 10 -4 into the k for the Cyt 
c-Cyt c exchange. In general, the value of k for a 
hemeprotein self-exchange will be sensitive to the 
degree of exposure of the heme and, all other 
factors being equal, changing the exposure of the 
heme by changing the protein conformation or the 
number of amino acids is likely to dramatically 
affect the exchange rate of the cytochrome. For 
example, Pseudomonas aeruginosa cytochrome c- 
551 has only 82 amino acid residues compared 
with the 104 residues of horse-heart cytochrome c, 
and has a self-exchange rate of 1.2.107 M -1. s -1 
[206], instead of 1.2.103 M -1 • s -1. A part of this 
difference may be due to the smaller size of Cyt 
c-551, which makes the hemes more accessible, 
and part may be due to a difference in work terms, 
e.g., the electrostatic repulsion in the Cyt c-551 
self-exchange is smaller (cf. Table V for the ionic 
charges). 
VC. lntramolecular electron transfer 
Rate constants 
calculated with the above 
parameters can be compared with data on the 
intramolecular electron transfer between ferricy- 
tochrome c and a bound Ru(NH3) 2÷ residue. 
We begin with the value of the bimolecular rate 
constant for reduction of ferricytochrome c by 
Ru(NH3)sHis 2+, 9.104 M -1 • s -1 [207]. When 
The respective values of So 2 also enter. Because of orienta- 
tion requirements the S for the free heine system may be less 
than unity. Consequently, we estimate that So 2 is 10 -2 (3) 2 
nm 2 and less than 1 nm 2 for the protein-bound and protein- 
free heine systems, respectively. 
[AG°'[~ is small, the theoretical rate constant for 
this reaction is given by (Appendix IB):

where k is measured in M -1. s -1 and where SKy 
=2.101° s -a, based on S=(0.01) 1/2 and xv 
calculated from 1.1013 exp(-fld) with 13= 12 
nm -1 and an electron-transfer distance d---0.32 
nm. (This distance is half the value used in subsec- 
tion VB for the cytochrome c self-exchange; the 
electron is assumed to be delocalized to the edge 
of the electronic cloud of the hydrogen atoms on 
the periphery of the Ru(NHs)sHis complex.) For 
o = 1.8 nm and/~=0.1 M, K A is about 0.4 M -1 
(including only electrostatic contributions to w). 
Using the parameters for the cytochrome c ex- 
change estimated above and Ru(NH3)spy 3+/2+ 
[96] as a model for the Ru(NH3)sHis 3+/2+ ex- 
change, h/4, and AG°/2 are calculated to be 27.2 
and - 8.4 kJ. mol -a, respectively 7. Substituting 
these values into Eqn. 44 gives k~al¢--(2" 101°) 
(0.4) e -75, i.e., 4-106 M -1. s -1. The observed 
value is 9.104 M -t • s -1 [207]. 
This experimental rate constant of 9.104 M -1 
• s-t may be converted to a first-order constant k 1 
for electron transfer at the heme edge by setting k a 
equal to k/SK A (Appendix IB). With S --- (0.01) 1/2 
and K A = 0.4 M -a for the cited o (cf. Eqn. 57 of 
Appendix I with w r, assumed for simplicity to be 
nonelectrostatic, given by Eqn. 25) the first-order 
rate constant k 1 equals 2.106 s -1. This k I is 
introduced into Eqn. 45 below. 
By the use of imaginative syntheiic techniques, 
a Ru(NH3)5-residue has been covalently attached 
to His-33 of ferricytochrome c and the intramolec- 
ular electron-transfer rate from the ruthenium(II) 
to the heme iron(Ill) measured [151-157]. The 
closest distance from the imidazole group of His-33 
to the imidazole group that is coordinated to the 
I The value of ~ for the cross-reaction was taken equal to the 
mean of the ~, values for the corresponding exchange reac- 
tions. For the Cyt c-Cyt c exchange the value of ~t/4 ~ 25 
kJ.mo1-1 mentioned earlier was used, while h/4 for the 
Ru(NH3)spy 3+/2+ couple is about 29 kJ.mo1-1 [96]. The 
o = 1.8 nm is the sum of the radii of the two reactants (1.42 
run plus 0.38 nm). AG °, defined in subsection IIA, depends 
on ionic strength, as do the w 's.

----- Page 33 (native) -----
heme iron is 1.18 nm [155] and the measured 
intramolecular rate constant is 30 _+ 3 s-x by flash 
photolysis [155] and 53 + 2 s-1 by pulse radiolysis 
[156] techniques. The rate constant may be com- 
pared with 2.106 s -1 estimated above for 'in- 
tramolecular' electron transfer at the heme edge 
(the driving force, -AG o , for the two electron 
transfers is similar). It is seen that the adjacent 
heine-edge pathway is approx. 105 times more 
favorable than the remote His-33 pathway, which 
involves electron transfer through the protein. 
Assuming that 2k, AG °, and fl are the same for 
the adjacent and remote pathways, the rate con- 
stant k for the remote pathway can be estimated 
from k 1 and the change in separation distance: 
297 
where A H~'~ and a H~'2, the reorganization enthal- 
pies of the component exchange reactions, are 
approximately equal to ),11/4 and h22/4, respec- 
tively. From the value of AH ° = -49.8 kJ. mol-1 
[155] ~ and the values used earlier for the )Cs 
(AH~I =25 kJ-mo1-1 and AH~2=29 kJ.mo1-1 
[96]), one finds AH~2 = 2.1 kJ-mo1-1, consistent 
with the small observed [155,156] value. A similar 
analysis 
for 
the 
corresponding 
azurin- 
Ru(NH3)sHis 2÷ molecule has just been published 
[208]. Finally, in terms of the present model, the 
entropy of activation AS t for the intramolecular 
electron transfer can be interpreted using the ex- 
pression, obtained from Eqns. 36c, 36d and 37b: 
AS o' 
k = k I exp(-flAd) 
(45) 
AS~2 =

Rfld, 
(47) 
where k is measured in s -1 and k 1 --- 2- 10 6 S -1. 
The difference in the electron-transfer distances 
for the adjacent and remote pathways Ad--0.7 
nm § and fl= 12 nm-k Substitution into Eqn. 45 
gives kcalc --- 500 s-l, which is to be compared with 
the observed value of 30-53 s- 1. 
In addition to the rate constant, the tempera- 
ture dependence of the intramolecular ferricy- 
tochrome c to Ru(NH3)sHis 2+ rate was also mea- 
sured. The flash photolysis results give AH* <_ 6.3 
kJ. mo1-1 and AS* = -200 + 8 J.deg -1 .mo1-1 
[155], while the pulse radiolysis studies yield AH* 
=14.6+0.8 kJ.mo1-1 and AS t= -163+4 
J. 
deg -1 -mo1-1 [156]. Although there is some dis- 
agreement, AH* for both studies is relatively small 
while the entropy of activation AS* is large and 
negative. The low value of A H* derives, we be- 
lieve, largely from the negative AH ° for the reac- 
tion: The reorganization enthalpy at the sep- 
aration distance r is related to the standard en- 
thalpy change of the reaction A H °' at that sep- 
aration distance in the prevailing medium by [60] ~: 
AH~2 = --f- 
+ --f- 
+ 
AH~2

(46) 
This value assumes the shortest path for electron transfer to 
be a linear one. Another possibility is a more tortuous path 
along a polypeptide backbone. 
Eqn. 46 follows from Eqn. 35 when I AG°'/hl is small 
compared to unity. In the present case AG o is - 17 kJ. mol- 1 
and h is 108 kJ.mol-k 
neglecting the AG°'/)~ term. The value of AS°~2 is 
-52.3 J-deg -l. mo1-1 [155] ¶ and -Rfld equals 
-100 J. deg -1- mo1-1 (calculated, as above with 
fl= 12 nm -1 and d= 1.0 nm). One thus finds 
-152.8 J. deg -1- mo1-1 for the calculated AStl2, 
while the observed value is -163 [156] or -200 
[155] J. mo1-1 • deg-k 
It is also useful to examine experimental data 
on the maximum value of the rate constant ob- 
served in the barrierless (-AG°'=)~) regime for 
the electron transfer from Cyt c to various re- 
actants and to compare this rate constant with 
calculated values. For the reaction of ferricyto- 
chrome c with the charge-transfer excited state of 
Ru(bpy) 2+, (AG°~-1.1 
V) the observed rate 
constant is 2.5.10 s M -1.s -1 at 0.1 M ionic 
strength [209]. For the reaction of ferrocytochrome 
c with Ru(bpy)33 +, Ru(phen) 3+, Os(bpy) 3+ and 
Os(phen) 3+ , all reactions having large negative 
AG°"s, the rate constants are 1.2, 0.65, 1.2 and 
0.76, respectively, in units of 10 s M -1. s -1. The 
maximum value of the 'activation-controlled rate 
constant', SKAtCp (Appendix IB) can be calculated 
from the parameters estimated earlier to be ap- 
prox. 8- 10 9 M -1 • s -1. The diffusion-controlled 
rate constant (kD in Eqn. 53b of Appendix IA) for 
the reaction of the cytochrome c's with large + 3 
The difference between AH ° and the AH °' in Eqn. 46 is 
negligible in the present system for the remote pathway, as is 
that between AS ° and the AS °' in Eqn. 47.

sents an experimental result for the value of SKArV 
for these Cyt c-metal complex systems (the esti- 
mated theoretical value above was approx. 8 • 109 
M -1- s-l). Some of the rate constants and other 
kinetic parameters that have been discussed in this 
section are summarized in Table VIII. 
VD. Photosynthetic reaction centers 
A c-type cytochrome is the electron donor to 
the oxidized bacteriochlorophyll dimer in the reac- 
tion centers of photosynthetic bacteria [211,212]: 
c2++ (BChl)2 ~ c 3 ~-+ (BChl)2 
(48) 
We first consider kinetic data on reaction (Eqn. 
48) for Chromatium oinosum and then consider the 
Rhodopseudomonas viridis reaction center complex, 
for which a crystallographic study has just become 
available, and for which there are kinetic data. 
The rate of oxidation of ferrocytochrome c by 
(BChl)~" in the reaction center of Chromatium 
vinosum is temperature-independent in the range 
100-4 K (k = 3.10 2 s-l); at 300 K the electron 
transfer rate constant is about 106 s -1, the pre-ex- 
ponential factor appears to be 6.108 s -1, and the 
activation energy to be 17.6 kJ. mo1-1 [19,212]. 
AG O' for the reaction is -43.5 kJ-mol-I [19,213]. 
From EPR measurements the center-to-center dis- 
tance of Cyt c and (BChl)~- is at least 2.5 nm, 
corresponding to an edge-to-edge separation of 
1.2-1.8 nm [214]. These two sets of results are 
examined next. 
First we consider the high-temperature pre-ex- 
ponential factor for the reaction in terms of the 
above model. This factor may be obtained from 
Eqn. 36b and hence equated (approximately) with 
1013 exp(-fld), 
neglecting any IAG°'/)~{ com- 
pared with unity in Eqn. 35 and neglecting AS°'/R 
in Eqn. 36b; substitution of fl = 12 nm -1 le0ds to 
d= 0.8 nm, and so a nearest carbon to nearest 
carbon distance of 1.1 nm is calculated using the 
correction in subsection IVB. The value of 1.1 nm 
is close to the lower limit of the range of the 
separation distances (1.2-1.8 nm) implicated by 
the EPR measurements [214] ¶, it would be useful 
to determine AS ° for reaction 48, it having been 
neglected in the above calculation. 
In a quantum mechanical calculation an HAS in Eqn. 12 
was inferred from the experimental pre-exponential factor 
to be 1090 Ll.mo1-1 [215,216]. The calculation in Refs. 
215, 216 also explored a fitting of the detailed temperature 
dependence of the rates. In the model used [215,216], both 
medium (solvent) and intramolecular modes were included.

----- Page 35 (native) -----
We turn next to the photosynthetic reaction 
center of Rhodopseudomonas viridis. The arrange- 
ment of the components has recently been 
determined from an X-ray crystal structure at 0.3 
nm resolution [217]. In addition to protein, the 
crystallized reaction center complex contains four 
bacteriochlorophyU-b and two bacteriopheophy- 
tin-b molecules, four c-type cytochromes, one 
non-heme iron and one menaquinone. Two of the 
four BChl's are present as (BChl)2 ('special pair') 
[218-220]), in which their pyrrole rings I are 
stacked on top of each other about 0.3 nm apart. 
The distance between BChl Mg atoms in the spe- 
cial pair is approx. 0.7 nm and the angle between 
the ring planes is about 15 °. To each BChl of the 
special pair is associated another BChl, whose Mg 
atom is 1.3 nm from the Mg atom of the special 
pair member, and the angle between the porphyrin 
planes of that member and the BChl is approx. 
70 °. Each of these monomeric BChl molecules is 
in turn also associated with a BPh molecule: the 
distance between the centers of their rings is 1.1 
nm, and the angle between the planes of their 
rings is approx. 64 ° . (This arrangement, in which 
there is a site between the special pair and the BPh 
had been predicted earlier so as to explain the 
effect § of a small magnetic field on the reaction 
kinetics for the closely related Rhodopseudomonas 
sphaeroides [221].) One of the BPh's is also in 
contact with a side chain of the menaquinone *. 
The latter is, in turn, close to the non-heme iron. 
A rectangular distribution of medium modes with a mean 
energy and width of 200 cm-t was used, corresponding to 
h o = 23.9 kJ. mol-1. The frequency used for the intramolec- 
ular mode was 500 cm -1 with ~'i = 222 kJ.mo1-1. These 
parameters provided a good fit of the temperature depen- 
dence of the rate constants, except at the transition to 
temperature independence, which is more abrupt than 
calculated. However the ?~i value seems unreasonably 
high- certainly much higher than h i for the reactions of 
Cyt c with typical metal complexes. 
§ An alternative explanation has been given [129]; it presumes 
that the decay constant fl in Eqn. 37 is quite sensitive to 
orbital energies, a result inferred from calculations with delta 
function and square-well potentials. However, as discussed in 
subsection IIID, more recent calculations [71] show little 
difference between the optical and thermal matrix elements. 
* A second quinone molecule expected for the other BPh 
molecule was not present and may have been lost during the 
preparation of the crystal [217]. 
299 
The four BChl's, two BPh's, the menaquinone 
and the non-heme iron are believed to be situated 
within the photosynthetic membrane of the 
bacterial cell, with the non-heme iron near the 
inner membrane surface and the special pair near 
the outer surface. The four cytochrome c mole- 
cules are located outside the membrane and are 
positioned roughly in a straight line in the crystal. 
The heme-iron of the cytochrome c closest to the 
special pair is approx. 2.1 nm from each of the two 
magnesium centers of the BChl's of the (BChl)2. 
The four heme groups (of the cytochromes) can be 
viewed as forming two pairs, the pair closest to the 
BChl is related to the outer heme pair by rotation 
about an approximately 2-fold rotation axis. 
Within each pair the angle between the heme 
planes (i.e., the angle between the planes of the 
first and second hemes as well as the angle be- 
tween the planes of the third and fourth hemes) is 
78.5 ° s and the iron-iron distance is approx. 1.4 
nm. The angle between the planes of the second 
and third hemes is 17.4 ° and the distance between 
their iron centers is approx. 1.6 nm. 
Flash-induced redox titrations have shown that 
two different c-type cytochromes, designated cyto- 
chromes, c-553 and c-558 to indicate the positions 
of their a-band maxima, are present in the Rps. 
viridis reaction center [222]. The midpoint poten- 
tials of the cytochromes are -12 mV and + 330 
mV, respectively [222,223]. The midpoint potential 
of the BChl-b dimer is + 500 mV at pH 8 [223]. 
Both types of Cyt c can reduce the (BChl b)~" at 
room temperature but only c-553 is capable of 
reducing it at 77 K [211,223]. The immediate elec- 
tron donor to the oxidized dimer at room tempera- 
ture is the Cyt c-558 [223] * 
We first consider electron transfer within the 
linear arrangement of Cyt c molecules. The sep- 
aration of the iron centers of adjacent cytochromes 
¶ We are grateful to Drs. J. Deisenhofer and H. Michel for this 
information. 
* If the approximately linear arrangement of the cytochromes 
in the crystal of the reaction center also obtains in the 
bacterial cell, then the high-potential cytochrome (Cyt c-558) 
may be the only direct electron donor to the (BChl)~; the 
apparent reduction of (BChl)~ by the low-potential cyto- 
chrome (c-553) then results from very rapid reduction of the 
Cyt c-558 by the Cyt c-553. This sequence has recently been 
entertained for Chromatium vinosum (see Ref. 20, p. 46).

300 
in the chain (1.4-1.6 nm) is similar to the sep- 
aration of the iron centers found for the optimum 
docking of two Cyt c molecules (1.77 nm, see 
subsection VB). Assuming that the 3./4 and /3 
parameters for electron transfer in the Cyt c chain 
are similar to those used for the Cyt c exchange in 
solution (25 kJ. mol-t and 12 nm -t, respectively) 
and using the correction in subsection IVB to 
obtain d, k is calculated to be about 106-107 s -t 
for electron transfer between two adjacent Cyt 
c-553 or Cyt c-558 molecules and about 107-108 
s-t for downhill electron transfer from Cyt c-553 
to a neighboring Cyt c-558 molecule. These esti- 
mates do not allow for the effect of the low 
dielectric constant of the medium, which will be to 
lower 3. and increase k, and departure of the heme 
groups from co-planarity, which will tend to de- 
crease rv and decrease k. These effects tend to 
cancel. It is interesting to note that the estimated 
rate constants for intrachain electron transfer are 
comparable to the rate constants for electron 
transfer from the terminal Cyt c-558 to the oxidized 
BChl-b dimer, a reaction discussed next. 
The rate constant for reduction of the oxidized 
special pair by ferrocytochrome c-558 is 4-106 
s-t at room temperature [224]. The reduction of 
the special pair is presumably by the closest Cyt c 
molecule. If the approx. 2.1 nm separation be- 
tween the magnesium of the (BChl)2 and the 
closest heme-iron in the crystal is also appropriate 
to the rate measurements, then the edge-to-edge 
separation of the chlorophyll and heme rings in 
the rate measurements is approx. 1.1 nm and, 
using the correction in subsection IVB, d is ap- 
prox. 0.8 nm. The driving force (-AG °') associ- 
ated with the rate constant of 4.10 6 S -1 is 170 
mV or 16.3 kJ. mol-t and the reaction is expected 
to have only a low AGr* in Eqn. 31. The value of 3, 
for the reaction is presently not known though a 
rough estimate of about 12 kJ. mo1-1 (based on a 
barrierless result) is made for (BChl)2, BChl and 
BPh in Appendix II. Using the value for 3./4 of 25 
k J- mol-1 for the Cyt c-Cyt c exchange reaction 
given earlier the estimated A for the (BChl)~--Cyt 
c reaction is the averaged of these, namely about 
56.5 kJ. tool -t. Using the above driving force, the 
AG* in Eqn. 31 is estimated to be 7.1 kJ- mol-1 § 
From Eqns. 31-33a and 37b the predicted rate 
constant is 1 • 1013 e -12'°'8 e-t'6/RT or 4- 107 s -1, 
using /3= 12 nm -1 and d =0.8 nm. This value 
may be compared with the experimental value 
[224] of 4.106 s-1 found for reaction 48 in Rps. 
oiridis. 
Picosecond flash-photolysis techniques have 
been used to study the primary electron-transfer 
reactions in reaction centers and in a variety of 
model photosynthetic systems [226-229]. An im- 
portant result of the studies with model systems is 
that the forward electron transfer from an excited 
porphyrin monomer or dimer to an electron accep- 
tor (usually a quinone) can be very rapid while the 
back reaction to reform ground-state reactants, 
which is even more exothermic, can be retatively 
slow, depending on the system and solvent used. 
The forward reactions generally lie in the normal 
free-energy region, and it has been proposed that 
the back reactions are slow because they lie in the 
inverted region. 
In reaction centers of Rps. sphaeroides electron 
donation from the excited singlet state of (BChl)2 
to BPh occurs in 4 ps (Kirmaler, C., Holten, D. 
and Parson, W.W., personal communication) * and 
the driving force for the reaction has been re- 
ported to be 0.13 eV though perhaps it may be 
somewhat larger I. Some spectroscopic evidence (a 
'shoulder') has been offered that the reaction 
involves the formation of BChl- as a distinct 
§ The resulting activation energy is 7.1 kJ. mol-t, if AS ° can 
be neglected. Its experimental value has not yet been de- 
termined apparently, but the experimental value for Rps. 
gelatinosa is 9.6 kJ. mol - 1 [225]. 
* Current work (Kirmaier, C., Holten, D. and Parson, W.W., 
personal communication) on this rate constant is consistent 
with the earlier value [230]. Very recently, evidence for possi- 
ble formation of BChl- in 1 ps and BPh- in 5 ps has been 
reported [231]. 
¶ The 
driving force 
is based 
on 
estimated 
potentials 
[228,234,235] for reduction of (BChl)~- to excited (BChl)2 
and of BPh to BPh-. Recently, delayed fluorescence mea- 
surements gave a driving force of 0.16 eV [236]. In Rps. 
viridis the estimated potentials [223,228,237] lead to a driving 
force of 0.12 eV. However, the in vivo measurements for 
BPh/BPh- in each case appear to be made with the Q 
present. If it were present as Q- rather than as QH, the Q- 
would destabilize the BPh- and so make the calculated 
driving force too small. The dielectric constant D s of the 
membrane has been reported to be about 3.8 [238] and has 
been estimated to be 30% less (Dutton, P.L., personal com- 
munication). Two negative charges a distance 1.5 nm apart in 
a medium of D s = 3 have a repulsive interaction of 0.33 eV.

intermediate [232]. (However, such evidence does 
not appear to be definitive.) From the crystal 
structure the closest approach (carbon-to-carbon) 
of the porphyrin rings in (BChl)2 and BChl ap- 
pears to be about 0.35-0.4 nm, and about 0.4 nm 
for the BChl to BPh rings (from the Mg in the 
BChl to the acetyl group in the BPh). Since the 
reaction is barrierless (negligible activation energy 
[232]) we shall take -AG O' ----)~ (Appendix II)§. 
Then, using fl = 12 nm -1 and d= 0.1 nm (after 
subtracting 0.3 nm from the 0.4 nm distance as in 
subsection IVB) a half-life of the order of 0.2 ps is 
calculated, as in Appendix II. 
The half-life for the electron transfer from BPh- 
to quinone in Rps. sphaeroides is 200 ps at room 
temperature and 100 ps, independent of tempera- 
ture, below 100 K [231]. Thus, there is a negligible 
activation energy. The driving force for the reac- 
tion at room temperature is, incidentally, approx. 
0.61 eV [228,241]. The corresponding values in 
Rps viridis are 4- 109 s -1 and approx. 0.47 eV at 
room temperature [224,223]. When the calculated 
k is written as 1 • 1013 exp(-fld) s -1, with fl --- 12 
nm-1 and d estimated from the crystal structure 
to be in the vicinity of 1.0 nm minus the 0.3 nm 
correction (subsection IVB), the calculated k is 
about 5.109 s -l, corresponding to a half-life of 
about 140 ps. The calculated value at 0 K (Ap- 
pendix II) is only slightly greater than this. 
In other experiments on the rate constant for 
the BPh-+ Q reaction, the nature of Q has been 
varied, causing the -AG o of the reaction to change 
by about 0.2 eV [242]. The resulting variations in 
the rate constant were only a factor of two or so 
[242] and, perhaps due to other changes caused by 
The potentials for the reduction of (BChl) ~ to excited (BChl) 2 
were calculated from the energy for the ground state to 
singlet transition E0_0(0~0 levels) and the reduction 
potential for the ground state (BChl)~/(BChl)2 couple. Eo_ 0 
equals the energy of the absorption maximum hi'max minus 
one-half the Stokes shift [240]. Values for the Stokes shift 
(450 cm-1) for Rps. sphaeroides are given in Ref. [234]. 
§ The self-exchange rate constants k for the Chl +/° and 
BPh °/- pairs are about 2-4.106 M-l.s -1 in a somewhat 
polar solvent (methanol/methylene chloride) [233]. If k is 
written as 1.1011 exp -x/4Rr M-t-s -1, then ;~,/4 is esti- 
mated to be about 14.6 kJ.mo1-1. In the less polar mem- 
brane system, h/4 would be less. The value of ~ is estimated 
in Appendix II to be about 25 kJ.mol -l or less. 
301 
the substitution of Q, were somewhat random. 
From Eqns. 1-3 it can be seen that in the vicinity 
of the maximum rate, i.e., when -AG°--h, a 
change SAG °' causes the rate constant to change 
by a factor of exp[-(SAG°')2/4)~RT]. With a 
value of 2~ of about 0.5 eV, the reaction is barrier- 
less at -AG O' ~ 0.5 eV and the above rate changes 
only by a factor of two when I~ZlG°'l = 0.2 eV, a 
result consistent with the data. Again, when a 
second quinone QB was present as Q~, the rate 
constant for the BPh-+ QA electron transfer was 
smaller by almost a factor of two [243]. The pres- 
ence of Q~ is calculated to reduce the driving 
force -AG O' by perhaps several tenths of a volt, 
due to the coulombic repulsion of the QA and Q~ 
in the low dielectric constant medium I. Such an 
effect is calculated, as above, to reduce k by a 
factor of near 2 from its value at -AG O' -- 2~. 
In a model porphyrin-quinone study [38] the 
maximum rate constant for the reduction of the 
quinone by the excited porphyrin (occurring at 
-zaG°'~)~) was reported as 2.1011 s -1. The 
carbon-carbon distance at closest approach of the 
reacting partners was 0.6-0.7 nm [244], giving a d 
of about 0.4 nm after using the 0.3 nm correction 
in subsection IVB. The calculated maximum rate 
constant, 1 • 1013 exp(-fld), is about 8.101° s -1, 
which is close to the reported value of 2- 1011 s-1. 
The various results in this section are sum- 
marized in Table IX. 
VE. Reactions of cytochrome c with cytochrome b 5 
and cytochrome c oxidase 
In this section we consider the electron-transfer 
reactions of cytochrome c with cytochrome b 5 and 
with cytochrome c oxidase. The first reaction in- 
volves electron transfer between cytochrome c and 
a heme protein of opposite charge and the second 
involves electron transfer of cytochrome c with its 
natural partner. 
It will be recalled that cytochrome b 5 differs 
from cytochrome c in several respects. The fifth 
and sixth coordination sites of the heme in cy- 
I As pointed out in an earlier footnote, two negative charges a 
distance 1.5 nm apart in a medium of estimated dielectric 
constant of about 3 has a repulsive interaction energy of 
about 0.33 eV.

tochrome b 5 are occupied by N atoms of histidine 
imidazole groups and the porphyrin ring is not 
covalently bonded to the protein (other than 
through the coordinated histidines). In addition, 
the net charge of ferricytochrome b 5, calculated 
from its amino acid composition, is -9 [245] and 
there are four negatively-charged carboxyl groups 
in the heme crevice region. By contrast, the net 
charge of ferricytochrome c is + 8 and the heme is 
surrounded by four positively charged lysine re- 
sidues. Therefore, unlike the corresponding ex- 
change reactions, interaction (of the hemes) of 
cytochrome c and cytochrome b5 is attractive. By 
using computer modeling, Salemme [246,247] has 
shown that ferricytochrome c and ferrocyto- 
chrome b 5 can form a complex in which the heme 
groups of the two proteins are nearly coplanar 
with their edges separated by 0.84 nm at first 
contact of the surface amino-acid side chains. Ad- 
ditional support for the formation of this complex 
has been obtained from protein modification stud- 
ies [248,249] (although the more recent results 
implicate interactions between five complementary 
pairs, rather than just four as originally proposed) 
and from energy transfer measurements using 
zinc-substituted cytochrome c [154]. 
The second-order rate constant for the oxida- 
tion of ferrocytochrome b 5 by ferricytochrome c is 
3.108 and 3.107 M -1. s -1 at 0.02 and 0.10 M 
phosphate (# = 0.04 and 0.20 M) (pH 7), respec- 
tively [249]. (The latter value is very similar to that 
reported earlier [250].) The association involves 
two oppositely-charged reactants, and so the equi- 
librium constant for this association is, as ex- 
pected, very dependent on ionic strength [251]. 
The experimental binding constant (expressed in 
concentrations rather than activities) for the re- 
actants is approx. 105 M -a at # = 0.01 M and 
approx. 5.107 M -1 at # = 0 [251]. The extrapola- 
tion to higher ionic strengths is highly uncertain, 
and we tentatively use a value of approx. 103 M-1 
for the binding constant at # = 0.04 M ~1 
Like cytochrome c, the structures of oxidized 
and reduced cytochrome b 5 are essentially identi- 
cal [252]. In view of the similarity of the electron 
transfer distance d and the structures of the heme 
sites, the value of SKy is unlikely to be very 
H
.
 
A binding constant calculated from S = 0.01 and a K A 
obtained from Eqns. 25 and 57 is only about 2-3 M-1 for 
these oppositely charged reactants. The contrast between this 
value and the extrapolated experimental binding constant 
suggests that for oppositely charged reactants in contact the 
local electrostatic charges may dominate the interaction and 
require that the delocalized-charge expression Eqn. 25 be 
replaced by a more complex one such as that in Refs. 
174-177.

different for the cytochrome c exchange reactions 
and the ferricytochrome c-ferrocytochrome bs 
cross-reaction. Thus, the 10Lfold difference in the 
rate constants (at # = 0.1 M) for these two reac- 
tions may reflect several factors, including a dif- 
ference 
in 
driving 
force (-AG O= 0.26 
eV 
[160,253]), 
which 
contributes 
a 
factor 
exp(-zaG°/2RT) or 150, and a difference in the 
stability constants of the precursor complexes (a 
factor of 103 if the experimental K A for Cyt 
c-Cyt b s is used). 
The ferricytochrome c-ferrocytochrome b s bi- 
molecular rate constant and binding constant may 
be used (Appendix IB) to obtain a first-order rate 
constant for a complexed pair, namely 3. 108/103 
or 3. l0 s s -t at /~= 0.04 M and pH 7, or if an 
S = 0.01 is also to be introduced, 3 • 107 s -1. This 
value may be compared with that calculated from 
Eqns. 31-33 with [AG°'/X [ << 1: the rate constant 
calculated using (as above) ~,/4 -- 25 kJ. mol-1, 
fl = 12 nm -1, d-0.54 nm and -AG O =0.30 eV 
at # = 0.04 M (0.02 M phosphate buffer) [160,253] 
equals 1013 e -12"°'s4 e -1° e s'8 or 2.108 s -1, which 
should be compared with the value of 3.105 s -1 
or 3 • 107 s-1 obtained above. There are, however, 
some puzzling features § 
Next we consider the reaction of cytochrome c 
with its physiological partner, 
cytochrome c 
oxidase. The functional unit of mammalian cy- 
tochrome oxidase, it will be recalled, contains two 
heme-A residues, namely cytochromes a and a3, 
differing only in their axial ligands, and two copper 
§ Pulse radiolysis experiments on the Cyt c-Cyt b 5 complex 
itself show a low (1.4.103 s -1) value for k (McLendon, G.L. 
and Miller, J.R., unpublished results). Also puzzling is the 
value of 5"10 3 S -1 reported [154] for the k for quenching 
(presumably by electron transfer) of a triplet in a zinc-sub- 
stituted Cyt c with ferricyt bs. The driving force of this 
reaction is about 1 eV [255], d is believed to be small 
(approx. 0.5-0.6 nm) and yet k is relatively small. In a plot 
of In k vs AG O' for related systems the maximum k was 
5. l0 s s -1 which is also relatively low for the small value of 
d inferred above from computer modeling studies. Possible 
interpretations include a prior conformational change or a 
wrong docking of the two proteins. In this connection it is of 
interest to note that the oxidation of ferrocytochrome b 5 by 
metal complexes and the competitive inhibition of the reac- 
tion by redox-inactive complexes are consistent with electron 
transfer through the exposed heme edge and an effective 
charge of -4 at the oxidant binding site [245]. 
303 
atoms [256], one of which, termed 'copper A', is 
magnetically isolated (although the existence of a 
weak magnetic dipolar interaction between the 
Cu A and cytochrome a has been recently pro- 
posed [257]). The Cu A is detectable by EPR in the 
cupric state. The first step in the anaerobic oxida- 
tion of ferrocytochrome c by cytochrome oxidase 
is the very rapid oxidation of ferrocytochrome c 
by cytochrome a with a rate constant of (8-9). 106 
M -1 • s -1 at pH 7.4 and 25°C; the estimates of the 
equilibrium constant for this reaction range from 1 
to 102 [258-260]. For a binding constant of ap- 
prox. 105 M-1 [261], the equivalent first-order rate 
constant for this step is (8-9). 106/105 s-l; i.e., 
approx. 10 a s -1 (Appendix IB). The reaction of 
ferrocytochrome c with cytochrome a is followed 
by a slower step (k= 40-100 s-l), presumably 
intramolecular electron transfer from the reduced 
cytochrome a to copper A, for which a separation 
distance of 1.3-2.6 nm has been estimated [257]: 
c/++[a] 3+[CuA] 2+~ c3++[a] z+ [Cua] 2+ 
(49) 
[al 2+ [CuA] =+ --, [a] 3+ [CUAI +. 
(50) 
The very rapid oxidation of ferrocytochrome c 
by cytochrome a is noteworthy in the light of the 
small driving force for the reaction (< 12 kJ. 
mo1-1 [258-260]) and the large distance between 
the heme groups, which has been estimated to be 
approx. 2.5 nm [262]. If the latter distance permits 
a heme-to-heme edge separation of 1.2-1.5 nm, 
then the above rate constants can be rationalized 
using the typical parameters derived earlier. For 
example, for modest driving forces (approx. 10.5 
k J- mol-a) and small h/4 parameters (approx. 25 
kJ. mol-1), a rate constant of the order of 50 s -1 
is consistent with an electron transfer distance d 
of approx. 1.5 nm if fl --- 12 nm -1. 
VF. Reactions of blue copper proteins 
We consider next the reaction of cytochrome c 
with copper proteins and also other protein-pro- 
tein reactions. It will be recalled that many 
copper-containing proteins contain a 'type 1' or 
'blue' copper center which imparts an intense blue 
color to these substances in their copper(II) forms. 
Such copper centers are present in the electron

----- Page 40 (native) -----
304 
carriers plastocyanin, azurin and stellacyanin, 
which each contain one copper atom per molecule 
[263]. X-ray structural work has shown that the 
copper sites in poplar plastocyanin and in Pseudo- 
monas aeruginosa azurin are very similar [264,265]. 
In each protein the blue copper is bound to two 
nitrogen and two sulfur atoms: the copper atom is 
coordinated by two histidine imidazolate groups, a 
cysteine thiolate, and a methionine thioether group. 
Although its structure has not been determined, 
stellacyanin must have at least one copper ligand 
different from that in plastocyanin and azurin, 
since the protein does not contain methionine. It 
has been suggested that in stellacyanin the site 
normally occupied by methionine is filled by a 
disulfide group [266]. 
After cytochrome c, plastocyanin is probably 
the best characterized metalloprotein, at least so 
far as electron-transfer properties are concerned. 
NMR studies have implicated two sites for the 
reactions of plastocyanin with metal complexes 
[267]. The first site is an uncharged region situated 
near the copper. This site may provide an electron 
transfer pathway via the exposed imidazole ring of 
His-87 and is believed to be the site used by 
negatively charged oxidants such as Fe(CN) 3- 
[166]. The second site is a negatively charged re- 
gion near Tyr-83 which is about 1.2 nm from the 
copper [267]. Electron transfer to and from this 
region may occur via the ~r-systems of aromatic 
amino acids and may be the site used by posi- 
tively-charged 
oxidants 
such 
as 
Co(phen) 3+ 
[164,197,268-272]. 
Reactions of the blue copper proteins with a 
variety of metal complexes have been studied 
[164,190,197,268-274]. Some representative exam- 
ples together with the rate constants calculated 
from Eqn. 42 are presented in Table X. The mea- 
sured self-exchange rate constants for the proteins 
are: azurin, 2.10 ~ M -a.s -1 at 50°C [276], 
plastocyanin, up to 2 • 104 M -1 • s -1 at 50°C [277]; 
stellacyanin, 1.2.105 M -1- s -1 at 20°C [278]. In 
order to calculate the k12 values, the azurin and 
plastocyanin self-exchange rates were corrected to 
25°C on the assumption that the activation en- 
ergies for these exchanges are comparable to that 
for cytochrome c. The self-exchange rates for 
azurin and plastocyanin at 25°C are then calcu- 
lated to be l0 s M -~ • s -1 and up to 103 M -~ • s -1, 
respectively. We have used the upper limit for the 
plastocyanin exchange rate constant in calculating 
the k12 values in Table X. Comparison of the 
observed and calculated k12 values shows that 
plastocyanin and stellacyanin are better behaved 
than azurin, at least as regards their cross-reac- 
tions [272,273,279] ~ 
In the case of azurin, the calculated values of 
the rates of the cross-reactions with cationic metal 
complexes are at least comparable with those pre- 
dicted from the cross-relation. However, anoma- 
lously low values for the rates are obtained when 
the reaction is with anionic metal complexes (Ta- 
ble X). This anomaly is also present, but to a lesser 
extent, for plastocyanin and in a milder way for 
cytochrome c (Table VII). Although only a limited 
amount of data is available, it does appear that 
these reactions with anionic metal complexes are 
anomalous. Perhaps there is specific binding of the 
anions. Anions tend, for example, to be more 
readily bound at interfaces than do cations of 
comparable size, a known result in electrochem- 
istry, and there is expected to be an interplay 
between binding and electrostatics. There may even 
be multiple binding sites. Precursor complexes of 
ferrocyanide with azurin [280] and complexities 
for the cytochrome c-Fe(CN)36 -/4- 
reaction 
[195,196] 
have 
been 
described. 
Different 
electron-transfer distances may also be involved 
[2811. 
It has proved possible to exploit binding at the 
Tyr-83 site of plastocyanin to obtain information 
about the distance dependence of electron transfer 
from this site to the copper center. In a recent 
study Cr(phen) 3+ bound near the Tyr-83 of re- 
duced plastocyanin was excited using a laser 
flash-photolysis technique. The Cr(phen) 3+ ex- 
cited state produced is a very powerful electron 
acceptor and was found to oxidize the reduced 
plastocyanin with a concentration-independent 
rate constant of 3 • 106 s -1. If it is assumed that 
the electron transfer is barrierless because of the 
high driving force of the reaction, then a value of 
I As noted earlier in connection with the cytochrome c studies, 
an incorrect self-exchange rate for the Ru(NH3)spy 3+/2+ 
couple has been used in certain other cross-relation applica- 
tions. This has resulted in some erroneous conclusions re- 
garding the validity of the cross-relation.

COMPARISON OF OBSERVED AND CALCULATED RATE CONSTANTS FOR THE REACTIONS OF BLUE COPPER 
PROTEINS WITH METAL COMPLEXES 
Reactions at 25°C, pH 7 and 0.5 M ionic strength unless otherwise noted. The rate constants were calculated using Eqn. 42 ahd the 
following exchange rates and redox potentials [272] for the copper proteins: azurin, 1-105 M-l.s -1, 0.31 V; plastocyanin, 1.103 
M -1.s- 1, 0.36 V; stellacyanin, 1.2.105 M-l-s - 1, 0.19 V. Net charges on the proteins (oxidized/reduced) are: azurin (-1/-2), 
plastoeyanin ( - 9/- 10), stellacyanin (0/0) [194,273]. The zero net charge on stellacyanin is based on the ionic-strength independence 
of its reaction with Co(phen)33+ [164]. For additional data, see Table VII.

Bimolecular reaction rate constants of plasto- 
cyanin (Cu 1 and Cu n) with various metal com- 
plexes have been measured for reactions having 
very negative AG °'s, and it is interesting to com- 
pare the results with those of cytochrome c. The 
reaction of plastocyanin Cu ~ with the excited state 
of Ru(bpy) 2+, of Ca Il with Cr(phen) 2+, of Cu ! 
with the excited state of Cr(phen) 3+ and of Cu n 
with excited Ru(bpy)23 + , for which -AG o" is 0.48, 
0.64, 1.06 and 1.20 V, respectively, have rate con- 
stants of 1.9, 2.3, 3.5 and 4.2, in units of 10 9 
M -1- s -1, respectively [281]. The diffusion-con- 
trolled rate constants k D calculated (for spheri- 
cally symmetric reactants) using Eqns. 25 and 53b 
are all about 6-10 9 M -1- s -1. The above values 
are perhaps somewhat less than this, but the dif- 
ference is small, and one possible explanation is 
mentioned briefly in Appendix IB. Another possi- 
bility is that the calculation of a diffusion-con- 
trolled rate constant corrected for electrostatic ef- 
fects is approximate. 
We next consider the reactions of the blue 
copper proteins with other proteins as well as 
some other protein-protein reactions. Observed and 
calculated rate constants for these systems are 
compared in Table XI. Except for the reaction of 
plastocyanin with cytochrome c, in which the re- 
actants are of very different charge types, the 
electrostatic work term corrections (based on total 
protein charges) are small and have not been in- 
cluded. It can be seen from Table XI that good 
agreement between observed and calculated rate 
constants is obtained. It is of interest that the rate 
constants for the reactions of azurin with other 
proteins appear to be in better agreement with the 
cross-relation than are the rate constants for its 
reactions with small metal complexes. 
In concluding this section, it is useful to com- 
pare the self-exchange rate constant found for Cyt 
c (1.2.103 M -1 • s -1) at 25°C with that found for 
azurin (2.106 M-t.s -a at 50°C [276]). The

potential of the 
activation energy of 54 kJ. mo1-1 for the Cyt c 
self-exchange [193] yields a k of about 2.104 
M -1- s -1 at 50°C. Oxidized and reduced azurin 
carry small net negative charges (Table X) and 
hence have negligible coulombic repulsion, while 
ferro- and ferricytochrome c have substantial posi- 
tive charges (Table VII). This difference in 
coulombic repulsions contributes a factor of about 
5 to the ratio of the rate constants. Again, the 
values of the electron-transfer distance d differs 
for the two reactions. In the crystal of azurin from 
Alcaligenes denitrificans pairs of azurin molecules 
are related by an approximate 2-fold axis, with 
their hydrophobic patches in contact and with a 
distance of 0.7 nm between the edges of the two 
histidine imidazole rings [285]. This distance is less 
than the 0.94 nm estimated earlier for the edge-to- 
edge distance of the two histidines in the Cyt c 
case. This difference is estimated to contribute a 
factor of exp (12.0.24) or about 20 to the value of 
k. These three factors (temperature, coulombic 
repulsion and distance) account for the difference 
in self-exchange rates of Cyt c and of azurin, if the 
values of ~/4 for both are comparable. Interest- 
ingly, the geometry of the ligands in azurin is that 
of a distorted tetrahedron, intermediate between 
the tetrahedron common for 4-coordinate Cu I 
complexes and the square planar or tetrahedron 
common for 4-coordinate CuII, thereby reducing 
the reorganization term (~/4) needed for electron 
transfer [286,266]. 
VG. Cytochrome c peroxidase 
We conclude this review with an example which 
illustrates the kinetic complexity which can arise in 
an oxidation-reduction scheme and for which an 
effort was made to extract a rate constant for an 
electron-transfer step. We use as an example the 
cytochrome c peroxidase system, which catalyzes 
the oxidation of ferrocytochrome c by hydrogen 
peroxide and alkyl hydroperoxides. The reaction 
of yeast cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP) with cyto- 
chrome c [287-289] and with metal complexes 
involves several intermediates [290-292]. Scheme I 
summarizes some [291,293] (but not all [293]) of 
the features that have been proposed for the reac- 
tion of cytochrome c with metal complexes. The 
first step is the formation of a CcP-peroxide com- 
plex CcP-OOH which then undergoes a bimolecu- 
lar reaction with the added reductant to form 
RFe TM or an intramolecular proton-catalyzed redox 
reaction to form CcPI. The latter is described as 
an Fe TM (ferryl) species possessing an oxidized 
protein residue (methionine-172 or tryptophan-51) 
[292-294] I. There is some disagreement concern- 
ing the formulation of the subsequent steps in- 
dicated by the solid [291] vs. dashed [293] lines in

The kinetics of the reactions of yeast cy- 
tochrome c peroxidase with metal complexes has, 
so far, only been interpreted in terms of the mech- 
anism indicated by the solid lines [291]. In this 
interpretation the rate law permits the assignment 
of a rate constant for the reduction of R+Fe TM to 
R+Fe m and/or for the reduction of RFe TM to 
RFe m (the kinetic data do not allow a unique 
assignment). Both reactions involve the reduction 
of the Fe TM peroxidase to the Fem state and can 
be represented by FelVO + e-= FemO. On the 
basis of the assumption that the stable form of the 
Fem product is FemOH (i.e., that the Fem species 
contains a coordinated hydroxide ion), the E ° for 
Eqn. 50 has been estimated to be +0.7 V [291]. 
Application of the cross-relation without any work 
corrections then yields a rate constant of approx. 
10 2 M -1 • s -! for the exchange between the Fe TM 
and Fem peroxidase. This value is higher by a 
factor of 1.106 than another estimate [290] in 
¶ It has recently been proposed (Ref. 295 and references cited 
therein) that the formation of CePI from the resting state of 
the enzyme CcP (PFemR) proceeds via an iron(IV) 
porphyrin cation-radical intermediate (P+ FelVR) and that 
the imidazole coordinated to the iron center then mediates 
the oxidation of the nearby methionine-172 by the porphyrin 
radical to form CcPI (PFelVR + ).

which proton-coupled changes were not consid- 
ered §. As discussed above, electron transfer 
through the exposed heme edge is implicated for 
the cytochrome c system, and it is likely that a 
similar mechanism obtains for the peroxidase ex- 
change as well [291]. 
The bimolecular rate constant for the reaction 
of ferrocytochrome c with the peroxidase is ap- 
prox. 5- 108 M -] • s -1 at pH 6.0 [287]. This very 
rapid rate, which is 103-10a-times more rapid 
than the reaction of the peroxidase with metal 
complexes of comparable redox potential and ex- 
change rates, has been ascribed [291] to the stabil- 
ity of the precursor complex formed between cy- 
tochrome c and the (negatively charged) per- 
oxidase (binding constant, approx. 105 M -] [45]). 
The X-ray structure of yeast cytochrome c per- 
oxidase has been determined [296] and computer- 
modeling [297,298] of the complex formed be- 
tween cytochrome c and the peroxidase implicates 
a structure in which the two heme groups are 
almost parallel with a perpendicular separation 
between their planes of 0.68 nm and a heme 
edge-to-edge separation of 1.65 nm. Although cou- 
pling of the two heme groups via aromatic (specifi- 
cally histidine-181 [299]) and conjugated groups 
has been invoked as an additional rate-enhancing 
factor [297,298], no 'special' electronic interaction 
of the reactants may be necessary to account for a 
first-order rate constant of approx. 103-104 s -1. 
Thus AG* is small ~ and, for fl= 12 nm -1 and 
d = 1.35 nm (after using the 0.3 nm correction in 
subsection IVB) the value of 1.1013 exp(-fld) 
equals 1 • 106 s -1. 
§The estimate of the self-exchange k in Ref. 290 is based on a 
fitted redox potential E °' = 1.1 V for the CcPII/CcP couple 
at pH = 5.3 and/x = 0.1 M, where CcPII is the one-electron 
reduction product of CcPI: E °' was deduced from applica- 
tions of the cross-relation and based on deviations of the f 
factor there from unity, a very uncertain procedure. The E °' 
in [291] corrects the estimated redox potential for assumed 
pH effects and suffers from a similar uncertainty. Different 
assumptions about the nature of the proton transfers that 
are coupled to the electron transfer will lead to a different 
exchange rate. 
The AG O' for the reaction has been estimated to be very 
favorable [290,291] and k/4 for a heme-heme system is 
expected to be small.

VI. Conclusions 
The theory of electron-transfer reactions has 
been particularly useful for correlating a wide 
body of experimental data on reactions of metal 
complexes in solution, particularly via the cross-re- 
lation. It has also been useful in understanding the 
absolute values of the reaction rates, and indeed 
gives reasonable agreement with the experimental 
data (Table I). It has been used for predictions, 
including that of the recently observed inverted 
effect. One large area of study, only briefly men- 
tioned in this review, but which has played a 
significant role in the interplay of theory and 
experiment, has been that of electron transfers at 
electrodes. Here theory has been useful in predic- 
ting correlations between homogeneous and elec- 
trochemical electron transfers. 
In the application to biological systems new 
features arise. Frequently, the reactants may be 
fixed some distance apart, and the attenuation of 
the coupling of their electronic orbitals with sep- 
aration distance then becomes an additional sig- 
nificant factor; not infrequently the (edge-to-edge) 
separation distance of the redox centers is only 
approximately known. This additional factor is 
more readily studied when the reaction is in the 
'barrierless' regime, i.e., in the regime where the 
driving force -AG O' has overcome the intrinsic 
reorganizational barrier h. 
There are several additional features which arise 
in the application of the theory to systems of 
biological interest for which increased information 
would be very useful. They include distances and 
orientations of reactants, and the reorganizational 
response of the protein to changes in charges of 
the redox centers. Nevertheless, the correlation 
between predicted and calculated rates for reac- 
tions involving redox proteins can be very good, as 
illustrated for the reactions of cytochrome c with 
various inorganic reagents (Table VII). In the case 
of intramolecular electron transfers (subsection 
VC), the current results on biological systems are 
consistent with an electron-transfer rate that falls 
off exponentially with distance, with an exponent 
near those found for nonbiological systems (Table 
IV). 
In applying the equations to the biological sys- 
tems we have, for concreteness, estimated some of 
the numerical values of the rate-determining 
parameters even when they were not known inde- 
pendently. These estimates, made to illustrate the 
magnitudes of the parameters, are of course to be 
regarded as tentative at this time. Nevertheless, it 
is encouraging that the values used lead to a 
consistent treatment of the reactions of the metal- 
loproteins (mainly cytochrome c) with a variety of 
substrates and of reactions in the photosynthetic 
system. 
Appendix I. Expressions for activation- and diffu- 
sion-controlled reaction rates 
IA. No steric effects 
The physical events involved in a bimolecular 
collision in solution between two molecules A and 
B involve a random diffusion of the molecules 
toward and away from each other, becoming in 
some instances a close-contact encounter complex 
A- • B and then diffusing apart. We may write this 
process as 
kD 
A+B 
~ A..B 
(51) 
k_D 
The electron transfer can occur at any stage of this 
process, with shorter distances weighted more 
favorably because of the nonadiabatic exp(-flr) 
factor. In the absence of reaction, the rate constant 
for diffusion k D multiplied by the average number 
of repeated encounters 7 will equal the mean 
collision frequency Z of the pair in solution. Since 
k D for small uncharged species with no slSecific 
interactions is of the order of 1/10 to 1/100 the 
value of Z,3, is of the order of 10 to 100 for such 
systems. 
If during the encounters, electron transfer oc- 
curs with a first-order rate constant ka, and if the 
reverse electron transfer rate is negligible relative 
to the rate of separation of A + and B-,

where K A, which equals kD/k_ D, is the equi- 
librium constant for formation of A- • B in Eqn. 
51. The force field used to calculate g A and also 
k D (both depend on long-range electrostatic forces) 
is taken to be spherically symmetric. The value of 
k D is given by [302]:

k D -= 4~rD/[=o~2exp(wr/RT)r-jr

(53b) 
where D is the sum of the diffusion constants of 
the two reactants and the work term w ~ is a 
function of r and, in the presence of an ion 
atmosphere, is assumed to be given by its equi- 
librium value, e.g., by Eqn. 25 in a Debye-Hi~ckel 
approximation. (If the ionic atmosphere were not 
quite keeping pace with these diffusing reactants, a 
different effective w r would be needed.) 
The rate constant k appearing in Eqn. 1 is the 
same as the KAk~ in Eqn. 53a. In other words, 
when the reaction is partially diffusion-controlled, 
Eqn. 53a is used with gAk I given by Eqn. 1, and 
hence by 
Kaka = xAo2exp(-AG*/RT). 
(54) 
Several models for ha 2 are available. For ex- 
ample, since KAk 1 is equal to the rate constant 
when diffusion control is absent, one sees that it is 
equivalent to some mean (equilibrium) collision 
frequency in solution multiplied by the reaction 
efficiency. The effective collision frequency in 
solution is the value Zsoln in the absence of the 
work term w ~, multiplied by an exponential factor 
exp(-wr/RT), which influences the probability 
of close encounters. The reaction efficiency is x 
exp(-AG*/RT), where ZIG* is the free energy 
barrier to reaction between fixed sites at the sep- 
aration distance r and is given by Eqn. 32. 
Thereby: 
KAo 2 exp(-AG*/RT) = KZsoln 
× exp[-

If Zsoln has its gas phase value (8~rRT//m)l/2o 2, 
where m is the reduced mass of the collision 
partners mAma/(mA+ma) and o is the sep- 
aration distance r in the encounter complex A- • B, 
then, since AG* equals (w r + ziG*), 
A = (8~rRT/m)l/2 
(56) 
Another model [18,21,303] is to take the equi- 
librium constant K A as the effective volume oc- 
cupied by the separation coordinate over which 
reaction occurs, 4~rr28r (the r's over which elec- 
tron transfer can still occur significantly lie be- 
tween r and r + 8r) 7, multiplied by the additional 
free energy factor exp(-wr/RT) describing the 
additional probability of finding the pair in the 
reaction zone: 
K A = 4'rro28o exp( - wr/RT), 
(57) 
where r has been set equal to o. 
The first-order rate constant k I in reaction 52 
is taken to be an effective frequency v for motion 
along a 'reaction coordinate' (vibrational mainly, 
but also with solvational contributions) multiplied 
by the reaction efficiency, mentioned earlier x 
exp(-AG*/RT), 
kl = 
exp(-zia,*/ar). 
(58) 
We then have from Eqns. 54, 57 and 58 and the 
relation between AG* and ZIG* that 
A = 4~rpSo 
(59) 
Eqns. 56 and 59 yield a value for A within a factor 
of 10 or so of each other, depending, of course, on 
the size of 80 which is typically of the order of 
1/fl or 0.08 nm [21,304]. This is the value used in 
the calculations in the present paper. 
In the case of an adiabatic reaction K is unity 
and the frequency p in Eqn. 58 is given as a 
I This 8r also appears in the theory described in Refs. 3 and 
58, via a term p there which is estimated to be of the order of 
unity and hence omitted from the present Eqn. 1; # is the 
ratio of this 8r to the width of the 'equivalent equilibrium 
distribution' along the reaction coordinate (defined in Refs. 2 
and 3).

case of a nonadiabatic reaction (r << 1) the prod- 
uct rv is given instead by Eqn. 32, and is seen to 
be independent of the frequencies vj of the nuclear 
motion! 
An estimate of the value of rv at contact of the 
reactants can be made from values of HAa in the 
literature. The estimate of HAB in Ref. 63 for 
edge-to-edge contact of the hemes and ~---1 V 
yields xv = 3.1012 S -1, which is close to the value 
of 1013 s -1 assumed in Section V. An estimate of 
HAB in Ref. 306 for a face-to-face contact of 
hemes gives a value for Kv even larger than 1 • 1013 
s -1. Since rv shouldn't exceed the value for an 
adiabatic reaction, and the latter equals a typical 
vibration frequency approx. 1013 s -1, one con- 
cludes that K = 1 for the latter contact. 
We next give the equation for ionic strength 
effects obtained from Eqns. 1-3 by including the 
effects on the work terms (Eqn. 25) and on the 
activity coefficients affecting the AG O" in the pre- 
vailing medium. Using the expression given in the 
footnote to Eqn. 38 for small I AG°'/~ I, and using 
the Debye-Hiackel expression for the activity coef- 
ficients, we obtain Eqn. 61 for the case of reaction 
7. In this reaction z 1 increases by unity and z 2 
decreases by unity in a one-electron transfer:

where C is the factor which multiplies -ZlZ 2 in 
Eqn. 38. In a self-exchange reaction z 1 + 1 equals 
z 2, and o 1 equals 02, so that the last term in Eqn. 
61 then vanishes. For any reaction Eqn. 61 reduces 
to Eqn. 41 at sufficiently low #. (To obtain the 
latter one notes that in Eqn. 25 o12 = ½(01 + 02). ) 
lB. Steric effects included 
A steric factor S, not present in the above 
equations, was introduced in subsection VB to 
take into account the fact that only some limited 
range of orientations of A and B at a given r may 
be appropriate for electron transfer in protein 
systems. We denote by A - B and AB pair in such 
a properly oriented configuration; A - B is formed 
from the encounter complex A.-B 
by suitable 
reorientation of A and/or B: 
A--B~A-B-~A++B 
- 
(62) 
For the present review it is convenient to sep- 
arate approximately two contributions to the equi- 
librium constant (denoted by Ke) for the forma- 
tion of A- B from A and B. This constant K e 
differs from that for forming A. • B from A and B 
in two respects. (1) The work term appearing in 
K A (Eqn. 57) is now for a fixed orientation of A 
and B and is based on the actual charge distribu- 
tion in the transition state rather than on total 
charges; (2) There is a steric factor S to correct for 
the fact that the 4~r in K A assumes, spherical 
symmetry, i.e., it is obtained by integrating uni- 
formly over the angular coordinates. This factor- 
ing of the equilibrium constant Ke into S and K A 
is, as already noted, approximate I. 
A first-order rate constant k I for a properly 
docked pair (active sites in contact) can be defined 
as in Eqn. 58, where AGr* is given by Eqn. 32. 
However, now the w r and w p appearing in AG °' 
there refer to work terms for forming A - B and 
A +- B- in the properly docked configuration (the 
same for both). The (activation-controlle/t) bi- 
While the factoring of K e can be avoided by using statistical 
mechanics, the resulting expression would be more com- 
plicated. The K e that is used above (SKA) actually has three 
contributions to the formation of A-B from A and B, a 
geometrical one in K A (the 4~O280), a nongeometrical one 
[exp(- wr/RT)] and a reorienting-into-a-docking one S. In 
the more rigorous statistical mechanical expression all con- 
tribute to a single free-energy expression W r, K e = 
exp(-Wr/RT), though in a complicated, entangled way. 
The quantity W r is a work term which includes the geometri- 
cal localization of A and B into a small range of r's, the 
localization of their relative angular coordinates into an 
interval, and the electrostatic and other nonelectrostatic con- 
tributions. In contrast, the w r in Eqn. 57 is only one of these.

----- Page 47 (native) -----
molecular rate constant can be written as SKAk 1 
with K A given by Eqn. 57, where w r is now for the 
docked configuration. Hence, 
k = SKAm, exp(-AG*/RT). 
(63) 
Eqns. 43 and 44 immediately follow from Eqns. 
63 and 32. Further, the maximum value of the 
activation-controlled k is obtained by setting AG* 
equal to zero in Eqn. 63, and yields the value given 
in subsection VC, SKAm'. 
An experimental value for k 1 can be obtained 
from the bimolecular rate constant k and the 
equilibrium constant K e (measured kinetically or 
spectroscopically) for formation of A - B from A 
and B, if the 1:1 complex principally exists as 
A- B rather than A.. B, namely k I ---k/g e. If 
K~ is not known, its calculated value SK A may be 
used instead, and we have k I = k/SK A. Both re- 
sults are used in subsection VC. 
Since the work terms in Eqn. 63, namely, the w r 
and w p in K A and zaG*, are appropriate to the 
docked configuration, they require a detailed 
knowledge of the charge distribution, particularly 
in the vicinity of the active sites of the proteins. 
Simpler calculations, discussed in subsection IVD, 
are typically adopted and bne of them is used here, 
for convenience, in the form of Eqn. 25. It should 
be noted, however, that the binding constants for 
natural partners, which generally have opposite 
charges, tend to be considerably higher than the 
values calculated from Eqns. 25 and 57, presuma- 
bly because of the breakdown of the Debye-Hi~ckel 
type theory for such cases, a result anticipated by 
Bronsted in his theory of specific ionic interaction 
[176] (see subsection VE). In the cases discussed in 
this article, the actual binding constants were used 
for these cases. 
When the rate constant k given by Eqn. 63 
becomes sufficiently high the reaction may, as in 
the spherically symmetric case (Appendix IA), be- 
come diffusion-controlled. Whereas the problem in 
the latter case involved the solution of a differen- 
tial equation for diffusion and reaction, leading in 
the steady state to Eqn. 53, the differential equa- 
tion to be solved now also involves a rotational- 
diffusive process in the reactants. For simplicity, 
we shall continue to assume Eqn. 53, with KAk 1 
now given by the k in Eqn. 63. If rotational 
311 
diffusion were sufficiently slow, however, the max- 
imum rate might now be below kD, even if k D >> 
KAk 1. However, the rate constants for the plasto- 
cyanin reactions show that for these systems the 
rate constant is close to the translational 
diffusion-controlled rate constant k D. 
We consider, for completeness, rate saturation 
effects which sometimes occur. We examine first 
reactions 51 and 52. In Eqn. 53 it was tacitly 
assumed that (A. • B)<< (A). Under these condi- 
tions a steady-state assumption for (A.. B) is 
appropriate. More generally the reaction is bi- 
phasic in time with a fast time constant being 
associated with the establishment of a near 
steady-state for (A-. B) and with the slow time 
constant being given by

(64) 
where kobsd is measured in S -1. When (B) becomes 
very small the 1/k 1 can be neglected and Eqn. 64 
reduces to Eqn. 53. On the other hand, when (B) 
becomes large, kobsa, measured in s-1, becomes k 1 
and, thereby, independent of (B). Rate saturation 
has occurred. 
Rate saturation effects may also occur in a 
reaction mechanism involving the formation of a 
dead-end complex. The slow step can now even be 
the dissociation of the dead-end complex rather 
than the electron transfer. Some discussion of these 
effects is given in Refs. 197 and 281, and is 
omitted here in the interest of brevity. 
IC. Dependence of HAa on nuclear configuration 
In the treatment in Section II, it was assumed 
that the thermal electron-transfer matrix element 
HAB was independent of nuclear configuration 
(the Condon approximation). Actually, there may 
be some dependence, e.g., Ref. 307. The detailed 
analysis of this effect depends, in part, on whether 
the nuclear motion is largely classical (minor 
nuclear tunneling) or highly quantum mechanical 
(extensive nuclear tunneling). 
For the present purpose a very simple treatment 
is adopted in which the nuclear motion is treated 
classically, so that the electron transfer occurs at

then be shown § that for a system at the intersec- 
tion the potential energy of the reductant minus its 
potential energy after loss of an electron, equals

reductant (reactant 1) to )~ ()~ = )~t + )~2), and that 
the corresponding value is )~1 when the reactant is 
in its equilibrium configuration. Thus, if for re- 
actant 1 in its equilibrium configuration the verti- 
cal ionization potential for donation of an electron 
to an adjacent bridging unit is V0 e, the correspond- 
ing value V0, when the system is at the intersection 
is

Hence, also, V o equals Vo e when -AG O' = X. If 
AG O' is varied at fixed X 1 and X 2 by varying only 
the oxidant, V o changes only because the energy of 
the intersection in Fig. 1 changes. The magnitude 
I In a nuclear tunneling situation, a broader interval of coordi- 
nates is involved for tunneling from any initial quantum state 
of the reactants. 
§ The argument used is based, for the present purpose, on a 
harmonic oscillator analysis and, to simplify the discussion, 
allots a solvent contribution outside the coordination shell to 
each ion, so that X = )'1 + )'2- (A more detailed treatment of 
the solvent would not pose any difficulty and would be based 
on arguments related to those used in Ref. 12.) The potential 
energy in coordinate q of the reactant, specifically the re- 
ductant, is f(q - qr)2/2, where qr is the equilibrium value 
of q and f is a force constant, assumed here to be the same 
in the ionized and ground states. If the electron is suddenly 
lost, this potential energy of this reactant is now f( q - qP)2/2, 
where qP is the new equilibrium value of q after the electron 
is lost. Setting q = qr, the vertical ionization energy V o for an 
ion in its equilibrium nuclear configuration is seen to contain 
a term f(qr _ qp)2/2 ' making it less than it would otherwise 
be. Summed over all q's of the reductant this term ,Zf(q r - 
qp)2/2 is denoted by )'1. We next make a similar analysis 
when the reductant is in a configuration at the intersection in 
Fig. 1. A treatment in Ref. 308 is used. In particular, at the 
intersection we note that a coordinate q equals q *, namely 
(m+l)qr-mq 
° [308]. The contribution to the vertical 
ionization potential is now 
,~f(q*-qp)2/2-Zf(q* 
- qr)2/2, which equals (2rn + 1),~f(q r - qp)2/2, i.e., (2m +

The superexchange mechanism via an atom was considered 
earlier in Ref. 313. The expression for the typical case that 
there are several orbitals in a bridge involves a multiple sum 
over these orbitals for each bridge, and each B/V o depends 
on the orbital. See, for example, the footnote in subsection 
IVA and Eqn. 25 of Ref. 73, and the extension of the latter to 
more than two bridges [73].

expression (X/4RT) (1 + AG°'//h) 2 at room tem- 
perature equals 9.6, 0 and 9.6 when -AG O' = 0, 2k 
and 2 h, respectively. The effect of variation of fl 
in the normal region or in the abnormal region, 
while not negligible, is seen to be minor in com- 
parison with the variation in (X/4RT) (1 + 
AG°'/X) 2 §. To the extent that nuclear tunneling is 
important, the effective sampling of extremes of 
potential energy and the thermal barrier would 
both be less. 
ID. Miscellaneous 
Eqn. 53, or its equivalent, was originally de- 
rived by solving the diffusion equation subject to 
the boundary condition that reaction occurs with a 
certain efficiency at the boundary r = o. Recently, 
this diffusion equation, or really a reaction-diffu- 
sion equation, was solved numerically for the case 
that reaction can occur at any r with a reaction 
probability which varies as exp(-flr) [55]. The 
results showed that within this 'continuum' frame- 
work for diffusion, Eqn. 53 provides a good ap- 
proximation for the conditions studied, e.g., as in 
Table V of Ref. 55. 
Not considered in the present review is the 
effect of the dynamics of solvent dielectric relaxa- 
tion on electron-transfer rates, experimental data 
on this subject being almost absent. A recent 
experimental study on an intramolecular electron 
transfer in the barrierless regime has shown agree- 
ment between the rate constant of the electron 
transfer and the reciprocal of a ('constant-charge' 
corrected) longest measured dielectric relaxation 
time [314]. Several recent theoretical studies on 
solvent dynamics in charge-transfer reactions in- 
clude references (Refs. 315 and 316, and references 
cited therein; also Sumi, H. and Marcus, R.A., 
unpublished data). 
We conclude this section with some comments 
on the slope a of plots of -RT In k vs AG O' at 
AG O'= O, or, in the electrochemical case, versus 
the activation overpotential ~ at 7/= 0. It follows 
§ Use of the square-barrier model for fl mentioned in subsec- 
tion IVC would be more artificial and yields a fl varying as 
V~/2 instead of as In V0. Also, hole transfer might occur, but 
for brevity of presentation only electron transfer is consid- 
ered.

from the analysis given in Eqns. A-14, 67 and

where )~i is the vibrational ('inner-coordination 
shell') contribution to 2~ (only the force constants 
f in the inner-coordination shell were assumed to 
change) and where )~si is the contribution of co- 
ordinate qs to h. 
We apply Eqn. 69 next to consider one model 
that has recently been assumed [43] for the solva- 
tion of singly charged organic ions. In this model 
the organic ion-solvent interaction is represented 
by a harmonic term with a force constant (as- 
sumed to be the same for cations as for anions) 
which exceeds considerably the force constant for 
the interaction of the solvent with an uncharged 
organic molecule [43]. Such a model clearly does 
not obey the quadratic free-energy relation used in 
obtaining Eqns. 1-3 and would predict from Eqn. 
69 that the slope of a -RT In k vs. AG O' plot at 
AG O'= 0 would be quite different from 0.5 for 
reactions between uncharged molecules to form 
ions, such as A + B ~ A++ B- or for the reverse 
reaction. (In reactions such as A++ B --* A + B + 
or A + B-~ A-+ B, there is a compensating ef- 
fect in Eqn. 69, so even quite different force 
constants f r and f~P can lead [3] to a slope near 
0.5.) Similar remarks apply to electrochemical 
oxidations and reductions at ~/= 0. 
The above result, namely of deviations from 0.5 
arising from the model in Ref. 43 can be shown by 
adapting Eqn. 69 so as to include that model. 
There were only the ion-solvent coordinates in 
Ref. 43, and we will write ~ = Xi. Using the model 
the last term in Eqn. 69 then becomes ¼(fr_ 
fp)/(fr+fp). 
The value of fr/(fp_fr) 
as- 
sumed in Ref. 43 for a reaction such as A* + B 
A-+ B + was between 0.1 and 0.3 I. It yields an a, 
¶ However, the treatment in Refs. 318 and 43 differed from the 
present one. It was classical for the ion-solvent coordinate 
and quantum for the other modes in Ref. 318 while in Ref. 
43 it was 'semiclassical' in the sense [63,64] discussed in 
subsection lib for the ion-solvent coordinate with a high (800 
cm -1) assumed frequency for that coordinate and with no 
other modes.

based on Eqn. 69, of between 0.66 and 0.71 for 
such a homogeneous reaction or, in an electro- 
chemical reaction, for the formation of an ion 
from an uncharged molecule. (It yields a value of 
a between 0.34 and 0.29 for the reverse reaction.) 
These a's differ considerably from the experimen- 
tal a's (approx. 0.5) given in Table III at AG O' = 0 
for the organic compounds and differ from the 
typical values of approx. 0.5 at 71 = 0 for the 
electrochemical reduction or oxidation of organic 
molecules [319-325] §. 
The solvent model proposed in Ref. 43 was 
introduced to explain why the inverted effect was 
not found [326] for the intermolecular electron 
transfer A* + B ---, A ± + B ~:. Recently, however, 
the inverted effect was found for the intramolecu- 
lar A* - B ---, A ÷- B- reaction [38], complement- 
ing the recent intramolecular and frozen-solvent 
observations of the inverted effect [36,37] for reac- 
tions of the type A-- B ~ A - B-. Moreover, the 
bridges thus introduced are not expected to have- 
any significant effect on the previously postulated 
[43,318] specific ion-solvent forces. All of the re- 
sults suggest that the explanation for the lack of 
the inverted effect in Ref. 326 lies in some direc- 
tion other than specific ion-solvent forces. For 
example, the quenching of the fluorescence of A* 
may arise not only from an electron transfer, but 
also (particularly if the electron transfer becomes 
slow) by competitive pathways, such as exciplex 
formation followed by a radiationless transition 
(e.g., Ref. 55 or references cited in Ref. 318). A 
variety of other possibilities exist [55]. However, a 
further analysis of the incidence and consequences 
of specific ion-solvent interactions would be de- 
sirable, as well as further pursuit of intramolecular 
examples of reactions such as A* - B ---, A ÷- B-. 
Appendix II. Franck-Condon factors and absolute 
rates 
The calculation of Franck-Condon factors has 
been discussed by many authors, both for radia- 
§ Numerous electrochemical results on metal complexes are 
also available and typically have slopes of about 0.5 at 77 = 0 
[132,133]. The theoretical value for these metal complexes 
given by Eqn. 69 differs slightly (approx. 0.04) from 0.5 when 
typical differences of vibrational force constants in the 
tionless transitions and for electron transfers. Of 
interest in the present case are the calculations for 
the case where many coordinates are present (the 
environment). For a reaction proceeding from the 
lowest state of the reactant(s) to yield quantum 
states of a set of N degenerate vibrational modes 
of the product(s), each having the same frequency 
v, the rate constant is found from Eqn. 13 to be 
given by 7: 
2~r 
2 ~ 
e-SSO 
k = --hH'~n 2"v=o F(v + 1) 3(AE°'+ vhv). 
(70) 
In Eqn. 70, v is assumed to be the same for the 
products as for the reactants. The ~, appearing in 
S (S = )~/hv) is N-times the value of A for an 
individual vibrational mode; 3 is the Dirac delta 
function; v is the principal quantum number for 
the degenerate states of the N vibrationally-ex- 
cited modes. Eqn. 70 is intended to be an ap- 
proximation to the actual situation where the fre- 
quencies of the vibrational modes are not equal. In 
the latter case, there are many largely nondegener- 
ate levels thermally occupied rather than only a 
relatively small number of highly degenerate levels. 
The sum in Eqn. 70 can then be replaced by an 
integral over v, and, on making use of the delta 
function, Eqn. 71 is then obtained: 
2 ~r 
2 
e- SSV 
= -T n;'~ h,r(v + 1)' 
(71) 
where v is a mean frequency (defined for example 
in Ref. 327); v now denotes -AE°'/hv 
and need 
no longer be an integer. Since any change in v is 
oxidized and reduced forms of the reactant are taken into 
account [3]. 
The Franck-Condon factors which appear in Eqn. 13 are 
obtained, for example, in Ref. 327, Eqn. 9.16. This reference 
also contains the idea of using a mean frequency when there 
are a number of contributing vibrational modes. One deriva- 
tion of the equations for the case of one coordinate is given 
in Ref. 328 for a spectral band shape. The Franck-Condon 
factor in Eqn. 70 is obtained by setting hv = 0 and hvab = 
AE °' in Eqn. 4-115 of Ref. 328. Eqn. 70 is related to Eqn. 19, 
or really to a predecessor of that equation, namely, Eqn. 5 of 
Ref. 27. When the latter is used and the limit ~'0--' 0 is 
introduced, one obtains Eqn. 70. (One uses the fact that when 
a-*O, (1/a Cry) exp(_x2/a2 ) becomes 8(x).) However, 
Eqn. 70 can be derived more directly, as in Ref. 328.

neglected, as is any other contribution to AS °' , 
this v also equals - zaG°'/hv. 
When higher vibrational levels of the reactants 
are also involved, e.g., at finite temperatures, the 
expression for k in Eqn. 13 contains Boltzmann- 
weighted Franck-Condon factors and can be writ- 
ten as §" 
2~r 
2 evy-Scothy l~,(Scosech y) 
(72) 
k= h--~v n2s 
where y = hv/2RT, I v is a modified Bessel func- 
tion, and the remaining symbols have their previ- 
ous meaning. 
We consider next some properties of these 
equations. At sufficiently high temperatures Eqn. 
72 reduces to Eqn. 14 *, while at sufficiently low 
temperatures it reduces to Eqn. 71. Further, the k 
given by Eqn. 71 has a maximum as a function of 
v (i.e., of -AG°'/hv) which occurs when v--S 
(of. Ref. 51). This result is seen by introducing 
Stirling's 
formula 
for 
F(v + 1), 
namely 
21/2--~(v/e) v, maximizing the expression in Eqn. 
71, and neglecting the variation in q~- relative to 
that in (v/e)". Thus, the maximum occurs at h --- 
-zAG °', just as it did for the classical expression, 
Eqn. 14. Further, it was seen earlier from Eqn. 35 
that the activation energy for the classical expres- 
sion is zero at AG O'= -~. This same choice for 
also leads to a similarly low activation energy 
when Eqn. 71 is used for the value of k at 0 K and 
Eqn. 14 for the values at high temperatures, or 
hence when Eqn. 72 is used over the entire temper- 
ature range. 
We next apply Eqns. 71-72 and 14 to the 
kinetic data given in subsection IVD for the pho- 
tosynthetic barrierles.s regime. In that regime, as 
already noted, -AGO'- - h. It will be assumed, for 
the present purposes, that there is an averaged 
vibrational frequency v for the contributing modes 
of about 200 cm -z (i.e., hv is 2.5 kJ.mol-1). 
(Larger quantum-mechanical corrections occur if v 
is larger than the frequency used here [131].) If the 
driving force -AG O' in the first step (or two steps)

* At high temperatures S coth y and S cosech y both become 
2hRT/(hv) 2. Use of the high temperature form [328] of 
Iv(x), namely (21rx) -1/2 exp(x-v2/2x), where x= 
2hRT/(hv) 2, then yields Eqn. 14 from Eqn. 72. 
315 
for electronically excited (BChl)2 ~ BChl ---, BPh 
is about 0.25 eV total, then the value per step is 
about 0.13 eV or approx. 12.5 kJ- mo1-1, and so, 
within the framework of the above analysis, a 
typical value of ~ for these reactants is expected 
to be in the neighborhood of 12.5 kJ. mo1-1 if the 
reaction is to be barrierless. We consider several 
value of h below in the range 5-38 kJ-mo1-1, 
together with the above values for hv and -AG °'. 
We first compare at 25°C the classical Eqn. 14 
with the quantum Eqn. 72 by comparing the factor 
multiplying 2~rH2B/hhv in those equations. (In 
Eqn. 14 this factor is hv/~-times 
the ex- 
ponential.) For the above factor such a compari- 
son at 25°C yields, respectively, 0.063 and 0.063 
(~, = 5.0 kJ. mol-1), 0.13 and 0.12 (~= 8.4 kJ. 
mol-1), 0.10 and 0.10 (~= 17 kJ. mol-1), and 
0.048 and 0.050 (~=25 kJ.mol-1). Thus, the 
classical Eqn. 14 and the quantum Eqn. 72 agree 
closely when hv/2RT is not large. (Here, it is 0.5 
at 25°C.) Analytically, Eqn. 14 is the 'high-tem- 
perature' limit of Eqn. 72, as already noted. 
The temperature dependence of k is seen by 
comparing the above results at 25°C with those 
obtained at 0 K using Eqn. 71: at 0 K the above 
factors are found to be 0.036, 0.12, 0.14 and 0.038 
for h = 5.0, 8.4, 17 and 25 kJ. mol-1, respectively. 
Thus, the results for ~<25 
kJ.mo1-1 
show 
negligible temperature dependence for the as- 
sumed value of -AG °'. At h = 38 kJ. mo1-1 there 
is, however, a significant temperature dependence: 
the factor mentioned above calculated from Eqn. 
14 is 0.014 at 25°C and calculated from Eqn. 71 is 
0.0019 at 0 K. Larger ?,'s will show an even larger 
temperature dependence. 
We consider next the absolute value of k. Since 
Eqns. 14 and 72 are seen above to give similar 
values for k at room temperature in the general 
neighborhood of h = -AG O' we shall simply use 
the classical equations 31-33b for the present 
calculation of k. When AG°'-.~-~, d=0.1 nm 
and fl -~ 12 nm -1, Eqns. 31-33b yield a value of 
3 • 1012 s-1, or a lifetime of 0.3 ps for the reaction, 
while for ~, = 5.0 kJ. mol- a, k = 1 • 1012 s- 1, which 
correspond to a lifetime of 1 ps. A ~, larger than 
25 kJ. mo1-1 will yield, for the given AG °', a 
smaller k but will also give a significant tempera- 
ture coefficient. The experimental value for the 
overall transfer is, as noted in the text, 4 to 5 ps.

----- Page 52 (native) -----
316 
Thus, perhaps the assumed 1.1013 s -t in Eqn. 
33b is too high a value for the orientational config- 
uration of the molecules involved, or perhaps there 
are high frequency modes (in addition to the 
others) which contribute a Franck-Condon factor, 
such as the one in Eqn. 71, that is temperature-in- 
dependent over the entire investigated temperature 
range, 5-300 K. The latter factor makes the rate 
lower by effectively contributing a temperature-in- 
dependent factor to the rate constant expression. 
We turn next to the k for the BPh-+ Q reac- 
tion. With a driving force in the vicinity of 0.5 to 
0.6 eV (subsection IVD) and a ~, of about this 
value (subsection IVD), the reaction is again bar- 
rierless. The values obtained from Eqns. 14 and 
71, or 72 may again be compared: with AGO'- 
= 
-X=-0.5 
eV, and hp~200 cm -~ the factor 
multiplying 2"rrH2B/hhl, in Eqn. 71 is 0.09, and in 
Eqn. 14 it is hp/(41rXRT) 1/2, namely, 0.06. Thus, 
once again the temperature coefficient is minor, as 
expected. Use of Eqns. 31-33b with d--1.0 nm 
and fl -=-- 12 nm-1 (subsection VD), yields the value 
of 5.10 9 s -] in the text, corresponding to a 
lifetime of 200 ps. 
Various authors have treated the rate constants 
in the photosynthetic system and used a wide 
variety of vibration frequencies and models (see 
for example, Refs. 306, 329 and 330 and see also 
Kirmaier, C., Holten, D. and Parson, W.W., un- 
published results). The negative temperature effect 
for the BPh-+ Q reaction of a factor of two in k 
has been interpreted by the latter authors in terms 
of differences of vibration frequencies of reactants 
and products. However, in the present calcula- 
tions, factors of two are not the focus of attention 
and possible effects of differences in vibration 
frequencies of reactants and products have been 
omitted.
