Abstract
Molecular structure does not easily identify the intricate non-covalent interactions that govern many
areas of biology and chemistry, including design of new materials and drugs. We develop an approach
to detect non-covalent interactions in real space, based on the electron density and its derivatives.
Our approach reveals underlying chemistry that compliments the covalent structure. It provides a
rich representation of van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonds, and steric repulsion in small
molecules, molecular complexes, and solids. Most importantly, the method, requiring only
knowledge of the atomic coordinates, is efficient and applicable to large systems, such as proteins
or DNA. Across these applications, a view of non-bonded interactions emerges as continuous
surfaces rather than close contacts between atom pairs, offering rich insight into the design of new
and improved ligands.
1 Introduction
Chemical interactions between a protein and a drug, or a catalyst and its substrate, self-assembly
of nanomaterials,1,2 and even some chemical reactions,3,4 are dominated by non-covalent
interactions. This class of interactions spans a wide range of binding energies, and encompasses
hydrogen bonding, dipole-dipole interactions, steric repulsion, and London dispersion.5
Molecular structure is governed by covalent, non-covalent, and electrostatic interactions, the
latter two of which are the driving force in most biochemical processes. The three-dimensional
molecular structure defines covalent bonds, however, non-covalent interactions are hidden
within voids in the bonding network. Although there are several ways to view and analyze
covalent and electrostatic interactions, an analogous method for non-covalent interactions is
conspicuously missing. Such a method would aid understanding of the complex interactions
between biomolecules, and the design of self-assembled materials and drugs, among others.6
In this work, we present an approach to map and analyze non-covalent interactions, requiring
only molecular geometry information, which compliments existing methods for covalent and
electrostatic interactions. Covalent bonds are intuitively represented using conventional Lewis
structures.7 They can be visualized from properties of the electron density with modern
quantum-mechanical models of bonding, such as the electron localization function (ELF)8,9
and atoms-in-molecules (AIM) theory.10–12 Also, purely electrostatic interactions can be

analyzed using electrostatic potential maps.13 Non-covalent interactions are frequently
visualized using distance-dependent contacts, generally without consideration of hydrogen
atoms.14–16 Hydrogen-bonds can be identified from the molecular geometry17 and from ELF,
18 while grid-based calculations based on classical force fields are used to model other van der
Waals interactions.19 Our approach outlined below, using the density and its derivatives, allows
simultaneous analysis and visualization of a wide range of non-covalent interactions types as
real-space surfaces and adds an important tool to a chemist's arsenal.
2 Theory
2.1 Background
The quantum-mechanical electron density, ρ, from which all chemical properties can, in
principle, be obtained20 is the key quantity in density functional theory (DFT). The reduced
density gradient, coming from the density and its first derivative, ( 
) is a
fundamental dimensionless quantity in DFT used to describe the deviation from a
homogeneous electron distribution.20–22 Properties of the reduced gradient have been
investigated in depth in the process of developing increasingly accurate functionals.23 In
density tails (i.e. regions far from the molecule, in which the density is decaying to zero
exponentially) the reduced gradient will have very large positive values. Conversely, the
reduced gradient will assume very small values, approaching zero, for regions of both covalent
bonding and non-covalent interactions.
2.2 Identifying Non-Covalent Interactions
To explore the features associated with small reduced gradients, we first examine plots of s
versus ρ (Figure 1). These plots were generated by evaluating the B3LYP24,25 density and
reduced gradients on cuboid grids, with a 0.1 au step size, for each molecule or dimer. To
provide even more sampling of the small low-density, low-gradient regions in hydrogen-
bonded complexes, additional calculations were performed for water and formic acid dimers
with a much denser 0.025 au grid.
Plotting s versus ρ, as in Figure 1, reveals the basic pattern of intramolecular interactions.
Methane (Fig. 1a) illustrates the typical covalent bond pattern. The top left-side points (small
density and large reduced gradient) correspond to the exponentially-decaying tail regions of
the density, far from the nuclei. The points on the bottom right side (density values of ca. 0.25
au and low reduced gradient) correspond to the C-H covalent bonds. Covalent bonds have a
characteristic saddle point in the electron density (bond critical points10–12), corresponding
to s = 0. Regions near the nuclei have larger density values and appear beyond the right edge
of the plot. The plot has an overall shape of the form aρ−1/3 because atomic and molecular
densities are piecewise exponential. The results for water are very similar, the only difference
being that the covalent bonds lie at higher density values, past the edge of the plot. In Figure
1b-d, we consider six examples of chemical systems displaying various types of non-covalent
interactions. Plots of s versus ρ for these systems all exhibit a new feature: one or more spikes
in the low-density, low-gradient region, a signature of non-covalent interactions. The origin of
this feature is made apparent by considering the formation of an intermolecular complex. The
predominant change in the density-gradient profile occurs for the low-density region between
the two monomers. The reduced gradient changes from very large values in the monomers to
near zero upon dimer formation. This is the basis of our approach.
We also explored other ratios of density and gradient values. Indeed, the reduced gradient
(regardless of the constant), the fundamental dimensionless variable in DFT, is also found to
be the ratio of density and gradient values that most clearly isolates non-covalent interactions
in real space (see supplementary information). In order for some ratio of the density and

gradient of the form |∇ρ|/ρn to be successful, it must distinguish between non-covalent
interactions and the exponentially-decaying tails of the density that occur far from the
molecular system. Both types of regions are characterized by low densities. In density tails,
both the density and gradient approach zero exponentially. In regions of non-covalent
interactions, the gradient will again approach zero and will be identically zero at the critical
point.
To this point, we have found that non-covalent interactions can be isolated as regions with low
density and low reduced gradient. The density values of the low-gradient spikes also appear
to be an indicator of the interaction strength. However, very different types of interactions (i.e.
hydrogen-bonding and steric crowding) appear in the same region of density/reduced-gradient
space. To distinguish between these interactions, we consider second derivatives of the density.
2.3 Identifying Interaction Types
Although localizing low-density, low-gradient regions enables identification of weak
interactions in a molecular system, more specific interaction types cannot be determined from
the density values alone. Low density regions are obviously related to the weakest interactions,
such as van der Waals, whereas those with higher densities will be related to stronger (either
stabilizing or de-stabilizing) interactions.26 Density derivatives can be used to this end.
The sign of the Laplacian of the density, ∇2ρ, is a widely used tool to distinguish between
different types of strong interactions.27 To understand bonding in more detail, the Laplacian
is often decomposed into a sum of contributions along the three principal axes of maximal
variation. These components are the three eigenvalues λi of the electron-density Hessian
(second derivative) matrix, such that ∇2ρ = λ1 + λ2 + λ3, (λ1 ≤ λ2 ≤ λ3). Analysis of these
components has been widely applied to chemical bonding.11,27,28
At nuclei (or non-nuclear attractors), the density reaches a local maxima and all three eigen-
values are negative. Interatomic regions between bonded atoms are characterized by the
presence of one positive and two negative eigenvalues (λ1 < 0; λ2 < 0; λ3 > 0). In the case of
covalent interactions, the negative contributions are dominant and the resultant Laplacian is
negative. For weaker, non-covalent interactions, the Laplacian in the interatomic region is
dominated by the positive contribution,27 independently of whether they are bonding or non-
bonding. Bonding interactions can be identified by the negative sign of λ2, as for the hydrogen-
bond in the water dimer example. Conversely, if atoms are in non-bonded contact, λ2 > 0 in
the interatomic region (λ3 > 0 and λ1 can be either positive or negative). An example of this
situation occurs in the center of the bicyclo[2,2,2]octene cage. Cases where several atoms
interact, but are not bonded, correspond to steric crowding in the context of classical chemistry.
Therefore, we can utilize the sign of λ2 to distinguish bonded (λ2 < 0) from non-bonded (λ2
> 0) interactions. Analysis of the sign of λ2 thus helps to discern between different types of
non-covalent interactions, whereas the density itself provides information about their strength.
This is illustrated in Figure 2, which shows a modification of our earlier reduced gradient and
density plots, such that the ordinate is now sign(λ2)ρ. The figure shows data for the hydrogen-
bonded water dimer, with the low-density, low-gradient spike now lying at negative values
indicative of stabilizing interactions. Conversely, the low-density, low-gradient spike for the
sterically-crowded bicyclo[2,2,2]octene molecule remains at positive values indicating the lack
of bonding in the central area of this moleule. Finally, the low-density, low-gradient spike for
the dispersion-bound methane dimer is very near zero, with slightly negative values, indicative
of weak attraction.
There have been many previous studies of λ2 in different bonding situations and attempts to
rationalise it in terms of movements (accumulation/depletion) of the density, that is often

understood as due to attractive/repulsive interactions.11,27,28 For non-covalent interactions,
the main features of the electron density and its derivatives appear clearly if the density is
constructed from something as simple as a sum of atomic densities (see Section 4.3). Indeed,
for all cases considered, results at the self-consistent and promolecular level are qualtiatively
equivalent, which rules out any simple connection to accumulation or depletion of the density.
However, when the effect of self-consistent calculations on the density and eigenvalues are
analyzed, we find that some quantitative differences are introduced by density relaxation. As
expected, the density-gradient peaks are shifted to more bonding regimes when comparing
promolecular and self-consistent densities. Specifically, a large shift toward smaller density
values is observed in the peak corresponding to non-bonded overlap, introducing less repulsion
and greater stability.
To summarize, since non-covalent interactions are characterized by low density and reduced
gradient values, they can be located by generating gradient isosurfaces enclosing the
corresponding regions of real space. The interaction types can be further understood by the
values of sign(λ2)ρ in these regions. These isosurfaces are the basis of our non-covalent
interaction method.
3 Computational Details
To obtain plots of the electron density (ρ) and reduced density gradient ( 
), density-
functional theory calculations were performed for a selected set of small molecules and dimers.
Calculations on methane, water, branched octane, bicyclo[2,2,2]octene, and the homo-
molecular dimers of methane, benzene, water, and formic acid, were performed with the
B3LYP functional24,25 and the 6-31G* basis set, using the Gaussian 03 program.29 Molecular
geometries of methane, water, branched octane, and bicyclo[2,2,2]octene are the same as those
used in the G3X procedure.30 The geometries of the methane, water, and formic acid dimers
were obtained from Ref.31 and the benzene dimer geometry was obtained from Ref.32
Additional B3LYP/6-31G* calculations were performed on Hobza's set of 22 bi-molecular
complexes.33 Diamond and graphite calculations were performed using the CRYSTAL
program,34 with the BPW91 functional35,36 and modified 6-21G* basis sets optimized for
diamond or graphite.34
To generate approximate promolecular densities, fully-numerical, LSDA,37 free-atomic
densities were generated for the atoms H-Ar using the NUMOL program.38,39 These densities
were spherically averaged over space and summed over spins. Because atomic densities are
piecewise exponential for each shell of electrons, they were then fit to one (H, He), two (Li-
Ne), or three (Na-Ar) Slater-type functions of the form ρat = Σj cje(−r/ζj), with the c and ζ
parameter values given in the supporting information. The use of simple exponential functions
to construct the promolecular density also allows first and second derivatives to be obtained
analytically.
To demonstrate our method for the interaction between a ligand and a protein active site, we
apply it to a complex of a bacterial regulatory protein of the tetR family with a tetracycline
inhibitor.40 The geometry was obtained from the protein data bank41 (pdb file 2UXO, only
chain B). All crystal waters were included in the calculations. Protonation states were
determined by WhatIf.42 Hydrogens were added using the hbuild function in CHARMM.43
The positions of the protein and water hydrogen atoms were optimized, followed by the
positions of the ligand hydrogen atoms. In both these geometry optimizations, the positions of
all other atoms were frozen. The protein was described with the CHARMM27 force field, the
water molecules were described with TIP3 force field, and the ligand was described with the
PM3 semi-empirical Hamiltonian. Since the exponential atomic densities die off fairly quickly,
only atoms lying within 6 Å of the tetracycline inhibitor were used in calculation of the

promolecular density and reduced gradient. For simplicity, all intramolecular interactions
within the protein and ligand, as well as intermolecular interactions between the protein and
water molecules, were omitted.
4 Results and Discussion
4.1 Small Molecules, Complexes, and Solids
Figure 3 displays low-gradient (s = 0.5 au) isosurfaces, subject to the constraint of low density,
for branched octane, bicyclo[2,2,2]octene, and the homomolecular dimers of methane,
benzene, water, and formic acid. A density cut-off of ρ < 0.05 au was chosen since it
encapsulates the non-covalent interaction region of interest (see Fig. 1). Other isovalues of the
reduced gradient could be used as a diagnostic of non-covalent interactions. The choice of cut-
off can be made objective by representing all points within the s versus ρ peaks (see Figs. 1
and 2). However, this more complicated algorithm is not necessary, since any cut-off that
fulfills the requirements of lying within the peak values already provides the interaction
information. Appropriate bounds on the density and reduced gradient should be selected to
isolate the low-density, low-gradient peaks for each chemical system of interest. The locations
of these peaks are sensitive to the atom types involved, the interaction strengths, and the level
of theory used to obtain the density (self-consistent versus promolecular densities).
The gradient isosurfaces are colored according to the corresponding values of sign(λ2)ρ, which
is found to be a good indicator of interaction strength. Large, negative values of sign(λ2)ρ are
indicative of attractive interactions (such as dipole-dipole or hydrogen bonding); while if sign
(λ2)ρ is large and positive, the interaction is non-bonding. Values near zero indicate very weak,
van der Waals interactions.
The gradient isosurfaces provide a rich visualization of non-covalent interactions as broad areas
of real space, rather than simple pair-wise contacts between atoms. We first consider the
sterically-crowded molecules bicyclo[2,2,2]octene (Fig. 3a) and the branched octane isomer
(Fig. 3b). In the first case, the low-density, low-gradient region corresponds to the center of
the cage, where steric repulsion between the bridgehead carbons is expected. For the branched
octane isomer, the isosurface lies between the closely-interacting methyl groups on opposite
sides of the central C-C bond. The interactions are repulsive nearer the C-C bond and weakly
attractive between the hydrogen atoms. Dispersion and hydrogen bonding can also be clearly
detected. In the benzene dimer (Fig. 3c), there is an area of non-bonded overlap located at the
center of each benzene ring, resembling the isosurface for bicyclo[2,2,2]octene. There is
another lower-density surface between the overlapping portions of the benzenes, where π-
stacking is expected. In the dispersion-bound methane dimer (Fig. 3d), the isosurface forms a
disc between the individual monomers. For the water dimer (Fig. 3e), the isosurface lies
between a hydrogen donor and oxygen acceptor, characteristic of H-bonding. Finally, the
formic acid dimer (Fig. 3f) reveals stronger H-bonds than in the water dimer, and also weak
van der Waals interactions between the two closely-interacting acidic hydrogens.
Crystalline solids exhibit rich and challenging bonding patterns. We consider the prototypical
examples of carbon in the diamond (Fig. 3g) and graphite (Fig. 3h) phases at their equilibrium
geometries. In diamond, the carbon atoms are sp3 hybridized and are connected by strong
covalent bonds that form a tridimensional, tetrahedral network. Fig. 3g shows a low-gradient,
low-density isosurface for a cuboid section of the diamond crystal. The non-covalent surface
extends through the voids of the structure, creating a network similar to that of the covalent
bonds. Graphite in its α form (Fig. 3h) has a bidimensional, hexagonal lattice, with the carbon
atoms sp2 hybridized and covalently bonded to their three nearest neighbors. The low-gradient,
low-density isosurface shows areas of non-bonded overlap at the center of the hexagonal rings,

as seen previously in benzene. π – π stacking interactions between the graphene sheets are
clearly manifested by the isosurfaces filling the interlayer spaces.
The use of DFT densities to visualize non-covalent interactions, including dispersion, may
seem counter-intuitive. In the case of dispersion, predicted binding energies are highly sensitive
to the choice of method. It is well known that most density-functional theory methods,
including B3LYP, do not account for dispersion binding44,45 and in fact predict no binding in
the benzene and methane dimer cases. However, one of the main advantages of our approach
is that it is based on properties of the electron density, the dominant features of which are quite
insensitive to the choice of electronic structure method used in the computations, particularly
for very weak interactions. As a side note, the main problem with DFT for dispersion is not in
computing the density, but in extracting an accurate energy. Different computational methods
give almost the same densities, but very different energetics. As two monomers form a
dispersion-bound complex, the changes in density caused by the dispersion interaction are quite
subtle. They vary depending on whether the method predicts dispersion binding or repulsion.
46 Nevertheless, they are quite small in magnitude in the inter-monomer region.
To test the validity of B3LYP densities for non-covalent interactions, we repeated our
calculations for the test set of six small molecules and dimers with MP2/6-311++G**, which
does predict dispersion binding. The MP2 results, with identical cut-offs, are given in the
supporting information and are virtually indistinguishable from our B3LYP/6-31G*
isosurfaces in Figure 3. Due to the reduced computational cost, DFT calculations with small
basis sets are recommended over MP2 for practical visualization of non-covalent interactions.
To summarize, plotting low-gradient isosurfaces, subject to a further low-density constraint,
allows real-space visualization of non-covalent interactions. In addition to the small test set of
molecules considered above, the method was successfully applied to Hobza's set of 22 bi-
molecular complexes;33 these results are given in the supporting information. Our model
discriminates between different types of weak interactions and allows for simultaneous
visualization of all of them. Classification of the various non-covalent interaction types agrees
with general chemical concepts. Surfaces with very low density values (i.e. ρ < 0.005 au)
generally map to weaker dispersion interactions. Surfaces with slightly higher density values
(i.e. 0.005 < ρ < 0.05 au) map to stronger non-covalent interactions, including both attractive
H-bonding (negative λ2) and steric clashes (positive λ2).
Although not the focus of this paper, our method is also applicable to covalent bonds, which
obviously appear at much larger density values than those considered above. This is possible
since all covalent bonds have a saddle point in the density, where s = 0. The low-gradient
isosurfaces are also distinctly different for single, double, and triple bonds; results are shown
for the ethane, ethylene, acetylene series in supporting information.
This also highlights a limitation of our method. It assumes an equilibrium or near-equilibrium
geometry, which is broadly applicable to most nanoscale or biomolecular systems. As
molecular geometries are compressed, the density at which the reduced gradient approaches
zero will shift to higher value, approaching that of covalent bonds. Also, the second eigenvalue
remains negative, despite the repulsive nature of the interaction at compressed separations.
This shortcoming has already been observed for other density-based bonding analyses, such
as Atoms in Molecules.28
4.2 Comparison with Quantum-Chemical Bonding Theories
Our method compliments existing quantum-chemical theories of bonding such as ELF and
AIM. The electron localization function (ELF)8,9 allows visualization of covalent bonds,
electron lone pairs, and atomic shell structure from properties of the density. A comparison

between isosurfaces generated using our approach and ELF is shown for the benzene dimer in
the supporting information. With a 0.9 au isosurface, ELF clearly shows the core electrons of
the carbon atoms, the aromatic C-C bonds, and the electrons localized on the hydrogen atoms.
While the ELF surface does not show any interaction between the benzenes, the ELF values
at critical points have been used to construct tree-diagrams that reflect weak binding in
intermolecular complexes.18
The AIM molecular graph showing critical points and bond paths, obtained using the AIM
2000 program47 is also shown in the supporting information. Note that the dispersion
interaction appears as two bonds. AIM predicts low-density critical points and bond paths
connecting the benzene rings via the two closest pairs of carbon atoms, capturing the π-stacking
interaction between the two benzenes. Similar plots are shown in the work of Waller et al.48
However, AIM is not an ideal method for visualization of non-covalent interactions,
particularly for large chemical systems where the calculations become prohibitively expensive.
Moreover, AIM depicts both covalent and non-covalent interactions as local, pair-wise contacts
along the bond paths;48 in large systems the vast number of AIM bond paths obscures non-
local van der Waals interactions. Conversely, our approach manifests non-covalent interactions
as broad surfaces between entire functional groups. This allows a much clearer and more
intuitive visualization of interactions in complex systems.
4.3 Biological Systems
Biological macromolecules, such as proteins or DNA, are probably the most relevant systems
for a visual representation of non-covalent interactions, which are the main driving forces in
biological processes. Understanding of these interactions is crucial for the comprehension of
their three-dimensional structure and biological activity required for drug design. However,
calculation of the electron densities of these systems becomes extremely computationally
expensive. A more effcient way to obtain s and ρ is required to display non-covalent
interactions. It is well-known49,50 that important topological features of the electron density
are contained in the sum of atomic densities, termed the promolecular density, 
. A
promolecular density obtained from simple exponential atomic pieces is able to predict low-
density, low-reduced-gradient regions similar to density-functional results. The free atomic
densities used in these calculations consist of one Slater-type function for each electron shell,
fit to closely reproduce spherically-averaged, density-functional atomic densities.
Approximate promolecular densities were constructed by summing exponential atomic
densities for branched octane, bicyclo[2,2,2]octene, and the homomolecular dimers of
methane, benzene, water, and formic acid. Resultant plots of spro versus ρpro for these species
show the same features seen in Fig. 1. Also, gradient isosurfaces generated from the
promolecular density (see supporting information) are very similar to those obtained previously
with self-consistent DFT and even MP2 densities (Fig. 3). Thus, our approach can be extended
to very large systems by using an approximate promolecular density, from which the relevant
isosurfaces are plotted. This allows rapid characterization of non-covalent interactions for
biomolecules, with only the molecular geometry required as input.
For all cases considered, results at the self-consistent and promolecular level are qualitatively
equivalent. Some quantitative differences are introduced in the promolecular calculations that,
as expected, shift the s versus ρ peaks to more bonding regimes. This is illustrated in Fig. 2,
which plots the reduced gradient versus sign(λ2)ρ for both SCF and promolecular densities.
The promolecular approach is expected to perform best for very weak or moderately attractive
interactions, where there is minimal response of the density to the interaction. Because the
density cannot adjust, the promolecular approximation gives the largest differences from SCF
results for non-bonding interactions, as shown in Fig. 2. This explains why the largest

differences between SCF and promolecular isosurfaces appear at the center of rings, such as
bicyclo[2,2,2]octene and benzene.
We first consider two model polypeptides: an α-helix consisting of 15 alanine residues and an
anti-parallel β-sheet consisting of 17 glycine residues. Geometries of the polypeptides were
obtained with the MMFF force field using the spartan program.51 Both were capped with
COCH3 and NHCH3 groups. Figure 4 displays low-gradient isosurfaces for cuboid regions at
the center of these polypeptides, colored according to the corresponding density values. For
the β-sheet, the lowest-density portions of the gradient isosurface arise from hydrophobic,
dispersion-dominated interactions, primarily involving the CH2 groups of the glycines. The
higher-density regions correspond to inter-residue hydrogen-bonds and repulsive interactions
between the adjacent C=O and N-H groups. For the α-helix, the isosurface has a large, low-
density region within the helix and between the side-chain methyl groups. The higher-density
portions of the isosurface correspond to inter-residue hydrogen-bonds along the helix and
repulsive interactions between adjacent N-H groups.
We also considered the non-covalent interactions between nucleobases in the B-form of
double-strand, six-base-pair (TGTGTG) DNA. The structure was obtained using the X3DNA
program52 with ideal geometry parameters.53 Figure 4c displays the low-gradient isosurface
for a cuboid section in the center of the DNA helix, colored according to the sign(λ2)ρ values.
The calculated isosurface resembles that of graphite, with broad, low-density regions indicative
of π-stacking between base-steps. The interactions between individual deoxyadenosine-
deoxythymidine and deoxycytidine-deoxyguanosine pairs are shown in Fig. 4d,e. The
isosurfaces show non-bonded overlap within the nucleobase rings, as in benzene and graphite,
and hydrogen-bonding motifs similar to the formic acid dimer. The strong N-H – O and N-H
– N hydrogen bonds can be clearly distinguished from the weaker, attractive C-H – O
interaction by the density values, as shown in different colors.
The hydrogen-bonding surfaces in the DNA model have density values of ca. 0.065 au,
compared to density values of ca. 0.035 au for the polypeptide hydrogen bonds. This is evident
from the degree of blue shading for the hydrogen bonds in Fig. 4. Since density values at
hydrogen-bond critical points correlate with the interaction strength,12,54 our results indicate
that the hydrogen bonds between nucleobase pairs are substantially stronger than between
amino acids, in agreement with literature data.55–57
Let us now consider the interaction between a ligand and a protein active site. The low-gradient
isosurface for a tetracycline inhibitor bound to the tetR protein in Fig. 5 shows a complex web
of non-covalent interactions between the ligand and active site. Several other protein-ligands
pairs have been tested, leading to the same conclusions. When analyzing non-covalent
interactions in protein-ligand complexes, it is usually assumed that these interactions are due
to a specific contact between two atoms.16 However, it is clearly seen in Fig. 5 that this
assumption is only partly correct. Hydrogen bonds, such as those between the tetracycline
amine groups and two water molecules (shown in orange), are directional and specific.
Conversely, van der Waals, dipole-dipole, and hydrophobic interactions, such as those between
the tetracycline and the Leu61, Val91, Ile136, and Val166 residues (shown in yellow), are not
atom-specific and occupy broader regions in space. The figure reveals some steric clashes
(orange and red regions of the isosurface) that must be offset by stronger, attractive interactions
to give binding in this crystal structure. A ligand “fits” the geometry of the active site, and the
interaction energy between the ligand and protein is comprised of many small contributions.
When trying to design a new ligand to fit a specific active site, one should consider all such
interactions.

5 Summary
In conclusion, non-covalent interactions have a unique signature and their presence can be
revealed solely from the electron density. Non-covalent interactions are highly non-local and
manifest in real space as low-gradient isosurfaces with low densities. The sign of the second
Hessian eigenvalue is used to give the type of interaction, and its strength can be derived from
the density on the non-covalent interaction surface. This approach provides a rapid and rich
representation of van der Waals interactions, hydrogen-bonds, and steric clashes, requiring
only the atomic coordinates as input. This tool offers exciting possibilities for aiding design
of ligands, self-assembled materials, catalysts, and other molecular systems. Of specific interest
would be analysis of the interaction between two large bio-molecules, such as protein-protein
and protein-DNA interfaces.
