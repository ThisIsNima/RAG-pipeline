The neural basis of drug craving:

This paper presents a ~ops~holog~~l 
theory of drug addiction, the ‘Incentjve-Sensitization 
Theory’. The theory addresses three ~ndamental 
questions. The first is: why do addicts crave drugs? Thar is, what is the psychological. and neurobiologicat basis of drug craving? The second is: 
why does drug craving persist even after long periods of abstinence? The third is whether ‘wanting’ drugs (drug craving) is attributable to ‘Eking 
drugs (to the subjective pleasurable 
effects of drugs)? The theory posits the following. (13 Addictive drugs share the ability to enhance 
mesotelencephalic 
dopamine neurorransmission. 
(2) One psychological function of this neural system is to attribute ‘incentive salience’ to the 
perception and mental representation 
of events associated with activation of the system. Incentive salience is a psychotogicai process that 
transforms the perception of stimuli, imbuing them with salience, mating them attractive, ‘wanted’, incentive stimuli. (3) in some individuals the 
repeated use of addictive drugs produces incremental neuroadaptations 
in this neural system, rendering it increasingly and perhaps permanently, 
hypersensitive (‘sensitized’) to drugs and drug-associated stimuli. The sensitization of dopamine systems is gated by associative learning, which 
causes excessive incentive salience to be attributed to the act of drug taking and to stimuli associated with drug taking. It is specifically the 
sensitization 
of inmntive salience, therefore, that transforms ordinary ‘wanting’ into excessive drug craving. (41 It is further proposed that 
sensitJzation of the neural systems responsible for incentive salience (for ‘wanting’) can occur independently of changes in neural systems that 
mediate the subjective pleasurable effects of drugs <drug “Wing’) and of neural systems that mediate withdrawal. Thus, sensitization of incentive 
salience can produce addictive behavior (compulsive drug seeking and drug taking) even if the expectation of drug pleasure or the aversive 
properties of withdrawal are dimirrished and even in the face of strong disincentives, including the loss of ~e~~tat~o~, jab, hame and Family. We 
review evidence for this view of addiction and discuss its implicaPions for understanding the psychoiugy and neurobiology of addiction.

A firm conviction of the material reality of Hell never prevented med~val ~h~t~~ 
from doing what their u~~t~n, 
last or covet~~ss 
suggested. Lung cancer, traffic accidents and the millions of miserable and misery-creating alcoholics are facts even more certain than was, in 
Dante’s day, the fact of the Inferno. But all such facts are remote and unsubstantial when compared with the near, felt fact of a craving, here and 
now, for release or sedation, for a drink or a smoke. 
(Aldous Huxley, The Doors of Perception, 1951) 
1. rNT~ODU~ION 
There are three major features of addictive behavior 
that need to be explained by any adequate 
theory of 
drug addiction *. The first is drug craving?, by which 
we simply mean 
intensely 
‘wanting’? 
drugsrs4. Al- 
though 
drug addiction!’ is defined 
as a pattern 
of 
‘compulsive drug-taking 
behavior’, drug taking does 
not in itself constitute 
addictive behavior. Only when 
the repeated 
self-administration 
of drugs leads to a 
pattern 
of compulsive 
dam-seeing 
and dug-ta~ng 
behavior, which occurs at the expense of most other 
activities, is a person 
said to be addicted79T’M. TO 
understand 
addiction, 
therefore, 
we need to under- 
stand the process by which drug-taking behavior evolves 
into compulsive drug-taking behavior. Presumably this 
transformation 
in behavior occurs because addicts de- 
velop an obsessive craving for drugs, a craving that is so 
irresistible that it almost inevitably leads to drug seek- 
ing and drug taking. It is d~~ult, 
of course, to provide 
an adequate 
definition 
of subjective terms, such as 
‘wanting’ and craving 1MV363, 
but clinical experience sug- 
gests that drug craving is fundamental 
to addiction; it 
cannot be ignored. Any satisfactory account of addic- 
tion must explain: why do addicts want or crave drugs 
so much? 
Drug addiction is also “a chronic relapsing disorder” 
(ref. 148, p. 522). The second major feature of addic- 
* Many of the terms in this article are used in different ways by different authors and they are not always clearly defined. To avoid arnbi~i~ 
we have provided a glossary with definitions of many of the most problematic terms. Thus, a reference to the glossary, which will be indicated 
by the symbol, t, refers the reader to the definition of a term. The reader may not always agree with a given definition, but we hope at least 
this makes it clear what we mean.

tion that must be explained, 
therefore, 
is: why drug 
craving often persists or can be reinstated, 
long after 
the discontinuation 
of drug use. An understanding 
of 
the propensity 
to relapse will be critical not only for 
understanding 
the process of addiction, but in develop- 
ing effective therapies. 
A third feature of drug addiction that requires ex- 
planation is that, as drugs come to be ‘wanted’ more- 
and-more, they often come to be ‘liked’ less-and-less. 
That is, as craving for drugs increases the pleasure 
derived from drugs often decreases. Why is this? What 
is the relationship between ‘wanting’ drugs and ‘liking’ 
drugs and does this relationship 
change during addic- 
tion? 
The purpose of this article is to present a biopsycho- 
logical theory of addiction, 
an Incentive-Sensitization 
Theory, 
that addresses 
these issues *. The paper is 
organized 
into four parts. In Part I the, theory 
is 
summarized 
to give a brief overview of its major fea- 
tures. In Part II the theory is put into a broader 
context by critically discussing other theories of addic- 
tion, specifically 
negative 
reinforcement 
(e.g., with- 
drawal avoidance) 
and positive reinforcement 
(e.g., 
pleasure-seeking) 
theories. In doing so it is argued that 
theories based on the concepts of negative or positive 
reinforcement? 
do not adequately explain the key fea- 
tures of addiction discussed above. In Part III research 
findings that support 
the concept 
of an Incentive- 
Sensitization 
Theory are reviewed. Finally, in Part IV 
the theory is elaborated 
and its implications discussed 
in greater detail. 
2. THB INCE~I~-SENS~I~~ON 
TBEORY 
OF 
ADDICXION: AN OVERVIEW 
The 
Incentive-Sensitization 
Theory 
of Addiction 
posits that addictive behavior is due largely to progres- 
sive and persistent 
neuroadaptations 
caused by re- 
peated drug use. It is, if you will, a “neuroadaptationist 
model’. It is proposed that these drug-induced changes 
in the nervous system are manifest both neurochemi- 
tally and beha~ora~y 
by the phenomenon 
of ‘sensitiza- 
tion’, which refers to a progressive increase in a drug 
effect with repeated 
treatment27z291. These sensitiza- 
tion-related 
neuroadaptations 
have not been consid- 
ered in previous theories 
of addiction. 
In fact, until 
recently, the phenomenon 
of sensitization usually was 
not mentioned in books and articles on addiction and if 
* -. 
sensitization was mentioned, 
it was referred to only in 
passing, as part of a more extensive 
discussion of 
tolerance. 
Nevertheless, 
it is proposed 
here that the 
defining 
characteristics of addiction (craving and re- 
lapse) are due directly to drug-induced changes in those 
functions normally subserved by a neural system that 
undergoes sensitization-related neuroadaptations. 
The neural system that is rendered 
hypersensitive 
(‘sensitized’) to activating stimuli is hypothesized 
to 
mediate a specific psychological function involved in 
the process of incentive motivation: namely the adieu- 
fion of incentive salience? to the perception and mental 
representation 
of stimuli and actions, This makes stim- 
uli and their representations 
highly salient, attractive 
and ‘wanted’. It is the activation of this neural system 
that results in the experience 
of ‘wanting’, and trans- 
forms ordinary stimuli into incentive stimuli. 
Sensitization 
of this neural system by drugs results 
in a pathological enhancement 
in the incentive salience 
that the nervous system attributes 
to the act of drug 
taking. The ~-activation 
of associative learning directs 
the focus of this neurobehavioral 
system to specific 
targets that are associated with drugs and leads to an 
increasing pathological 
focus of incentive salience on 
drug-related 
stimuli. Thus, with repeated drug use the 
act of drug taking and drug-associated 
stimuli, gradu- 
ally become more and more attractive. Drug-associated 
stimuli become more and more able to control behav- 
ior, because the neural system that mediates ‘wanting’ 
becomes progressively sensitized. ‘Wanting’ evolves into 
obsessive craving and this is manifest behaviorally as 
compulsive drug seeking and drug taking. Therefore, 
by this view, drug craving and addictive behavior are 
due specifically to sensitization of incentive salience. 
But ‘wanting’ is not ‘liking’. The neural 
system 
responsible for ‘wanting’ incentives is proposed to be 
separable from those responsible for ‘liking’ incentives 
(i.e., for mediating pleasure) 
and repeated 
drug use 
only sensitizes the neural system responsible for ‘want- 
ing’. Because of this, addictive behavior is fundamen- 
tally a problem 
of ~nsitization”induced 
excessive 
‘wanting’ alone. This is in contrast to ‘pleasure-seek- 
ing’ theories of addiction, which explicitly assume that 
the incentive motivational properties of drugs are due 
directly to their subjective pleasurable effects; i.e., their 
ability to produce positive affective states. In colloquial 
language, 
it is usually assumed 
that addicts ‘want’ 
drugs because they ‘like’ drugs and the more they ‘like’

them the more they should ‘want’ them. In this tradi- 
tional view ‘wanting’ and ‘liking’ drugs are necessarily 
connected. 
The 
Incentive-Sensitization 
Theory 
is 
unique, however, because we propose the progressive 
increase in drug ‘wanting’ that characterizes 
addiction 
is not accompanied 
by an increase 
in the pleasure 
derived from drugs. Repeated drug use does not sensi- 
tize neural systems responsible for the subjective plea- 
surable? effects of drugs, only those responsible 
for 
incentive salience - transforming 
‘wanting’ into crav- 
ing. 
In addition, the neuroadaptations 
underlying behav- 
ioral sensitization 
are long-lasting and in some cases 
they may be permanent. 
It is hypothesized that it is the 
persistence 
of sensitization-related 
neuroadaptations 
that renders 
addicts hypersensitive 
to drugs and to 
drug-related 
stimuli, even after years of abstinence. It 
is the permanence 
of sensitization 
that is thought to 
render drug-related 
stimuli so effective in precipitating 
relapse, even in detoxified, ‘recovered’ addicts. 
Finally, it is hypothesized 
that the neural substrate 
for incentive-sensitization 
(that is the neural system(s) 
that normally attributes 
salience to incentive stimuli 
and becomes 
sensitized 
by addictive 
drugs) is the 
mesotelencephalic 
dopamine system. Sensitization 
re- 
sults in an increase 
in the responsiveness 
of the 
dopamine system to activating stimuli, such that acti- 
vating stimuli produce a greater increase in dopamine 
neurotransmission 
in sensitized than in non-sensitized 
individuals. 
The 
relationship 
between 
changes 
in 
dopamine 
neurotransmission, 
the subjective pleasur- 
able effects of drugs and incentive 
salience, which 
occurs during addiction 
according 
to the Incentive- 
Sensitization 
Theory, 
are illustrated 
schematically 
in 
Fig. 1. 
The Incentive-Sensitization 
Theory of Addiction will 
be discussed in much greater detail later. Before that, 
however, we need to address the features of addictive 
behavior that are not adequately 
explained by other 
theories of addiction and thus require explanation by a 
new 
theory. 
The most widely accepted 
theories 
of 
addiction presently fall into two classes: negative rein- 
forcement 
models (e.g., drugs are taken to avoid the 
symptoms of withdrawal) and positive reinforcement 
models (i.e., drugs reinforce self-administration 
behav- 
ior by producing 
pleasure). 
There 
have been many 
papers describing the strengths and short-comings 
of 
negative and positive reinforcement 
views of addic- 
tion86J26,363,365 and it is not necessary to review this 
entire literature in great detail here. Instead, negative 
and positive reinforcement 
models will be only briefly 
summarized

key features of addiction (e.g., craving and relapse) will

Fig. 1. A schematic illustration of changes, as addiction develops, in 
(A) the pleasurable affective experience produced by drugs; (B) the 
incentive salience attributed 
to drug-associated 
stimuli and their 
mental representations 
and to other stimuli; and (0 the activation of 
dopamine systems (arrows); as proposed by Incentive-Sensitization. 
Dopamine systems are hypothesized to provide the neural substrate 
for incentive salience. Panel 1 depicts the subjective experience and 
degree of incentive salience in a normal individual (before taking a 
drug). We assume the person is not depressed 
and therefore, 
the 
normal affective state is fairly neutral, but slightly in the positive 
direction (as is incentive salience). Panel 2 indicates that the initial 
drug experience (or first few drug experiences) results in a marked 
increase 
in subjective pleasure (the drug is ‘liked’) and in the 
attribution 
of salience to stimuli in the immediate environment. 
These are not yet ‘drug-related’ stimuli because they have not yet 
been linked associatively with the drug experience. (Note that the 
initial drug experience could also have aversive components, 
but 
these are not depicted here.) The initial drug experience is accompa- 
nied by an increase in dopamine neurotransmission, 
as indicated by 
an increase in the size of the arrow in the lower panel indicating 
‘dopamine activity’. Panel 3 shows that after many drug experiences 
and the development of addictive behavior, the response to the same 
dose of the drug shown in Panel 2 is changed. In the addict the 
subjective pleasurable 
effects of the drug are decreased 
due to 
tolerance (alternatively, they could be unchanged, as discussed in 
Fig. 2 and Note 5 in Ch. 6). But the incentive salience attributed to 
drug taking is markedly enhanced due to sensitization of the neural 
system responsible for the attribution of incentive salience. Due to 
associative conditioning there is a focus of incentive salience on what 
are now drug-associated 
stimuli. It is further hypothesized that this 
sensitization of incentive salience is due to sensitization of dopamine 
neurotransmission 
(large arrow in lower panel; but also see Note 4 in 
Ch. 6). Panel 4 shows that in the addict exposure to conditioned 
incentive stimuli (stimuli that have acquired incentive value through 
their association with drugs) may produce effects similar to the drug 
itself, but of lesser magnitude. It is the sensitization of incentive 
salience depicted 
in Panels 3 and 4 that is hypothesized 
to be 
responsible 
for excessive drug ‘wanting’ (craving) in the addict, 
leading to compulsive drug-seeking and drug-taking behavior. 
be emphasized, primarily to provide a comparison with 
the Incentive-Sensitization 
Theory. We want to stress, 
however, that none of these views are mutually exclu- 
sive. Pleasure-seeking, 
escape from distress and incen- 
tive-sensitization 
probably 
each play some role in 
drug-taking behavior. 
3. THEORIES 
OF ADDICTION 
3.1. Negative reinforcement 
views of addiction (escape 
from distress) 
Historically, the aversive consequences 
of discontin- 
uing drug use (the withdrawal syndrome) have been a 


----- Page 5 (native text) -----
251 
central focus of research on addiction, in part because 
many early studies were on opiates, which produce 
clear tolerance and physical withdrawal symptoms. This 
research 
emphasized 
the action of drugs as negative 
reinforcerst64,148,180,227,312,326,337,349,365 
. To 
paraphrase 
Wise and Bozarth3‘j5, negative reinforcers 
sustain be- 
havior (drug seeking and drug taking in this case) not 
because of the state they produce, but because of the 
state they alleviate. According to this negative rein- 
forcement 
view of addiction 
drug use is maintained 
because the aversive symptoms associated with with- 
drawal are alleviated by the drug. Addictive drugs that 
do not result in overt physical withdrawal symptoms, 
such as cocaine and the amphetamines, 
are thought to 
act as negative reinforcers by alleviating a ‘psychologi- 
cal distress syndrome’ produced by the discontinuation 
of drug use (ref. 105 for example). In addition, previ- 
ously neutral 
environmental 
stimuli associated 
with 
withdrawal can themselves come to elicit withdrawal- 
like 
symptoms, 
by secondary 
conditioning305,306,357. 
Thus, drugs may not only alleviate 
‘primary’ with- 
drawal symptoms, but also the conditioned 
withdrawal 
symptoms induced by exposure to drug-related 
stimuli. 
A second negative reinforcement 
view is that drugs are 
sometimes used to ‘self-medicate’, relieving preexistent 
symptoms such as pain, anxiety or depression 
that 
occur in life independent 
of drug use (ref. 170 for 
example). 
The traditional 
focus on withdrawal and tolerance 
was driven by the assumption that these processes are 
critical for the development 
and maintenance of addic- 
tive behavior. It is now clear, however, that the avoid- 
ance of withdrawal is not the most important factor in 
the development or maintenance 
of addictive behavior, 
although certainly 
the avoidance 
of withdrawal may 
motivate 
drug-seeking 
and drug-taking 
behavior 
in 
some instances. A number of leading figures in drug 
addiction 
research 
have noted, 
for example, 
that 
“physical dependence 
is neither a necessary nor suffi- 
cient condition for addiction” 
(ref. 365, p. 470), that 
“for rats and monkeys physical dependence 
is neither a 
necessary nor a sufficient condition for opiates to act 
as reinforcers” 
(ref. 290, p. 186) and that “physical 
dependence 
is currently viewed not so much as a direct 
cause of drug dependence 
but as one of several factors 
that contribute to its development” 
(ref. 148, p. 527). A 
number of critiques of negative reinforcement 
theories 
of addiction have been published*6T149,326,363,365 
and the 
major shortcomings of negative reinforcement 
theories 
in explaining addiction are briefly summarized below. 
3.1.1. Problems with negative reinforcement views 
- Both people and animals will self-administer 
opioids 
in the absence of withdrawal 
symptoms or physical 
dependence335,372. For example, Ternes et a1.335 found 
that in cynomolgus 
monkeys the opioid, hydromor- 
phone, 
maintained 
self-administration 
at doses that 
produced 
neither tolerance 
nor physical dependence, 
the latter indicated by the absence of any effect of a 
naloxone challenge. Similarly, Iamb et a1.‘92 recently 
reported 
that former heroin addicts, who showed no 
withdrawal symptoms upon a naloxone challenge, nev- 
ertheless worked at high rates (lever pressed) to re- 
ceive a low-dose injection of morphine. 
- Maximal periods of drug self-administration 
often do 
not coincide in time with periods of maximal with- 
drawal distress365. This lack of correlation 
between 
withdrawal distress and drug-seeking behavior is also 
evident in comparisons made across drug classes. Jaffe 
(ref. 149, p. 9) notes that, although the severity of the 
withdrawal syndrome associated with different 
drugs 
varies dramatically, ranging from very subtle physiolog- 
ical signs to life-threatening 
consequences, 
“there 
is 
little correlation 
between the visibility or physiological 
seriousness of withdrawal signs and their motivational 
force” in maintaining addictive behavior. 
- There are many drugs used medically that produce 
withdrawal syndromes but “are not typically self-ad- 
ministered for non-medical purposes”, including “cer- 
tain tricyclic antidepressants 
(imipramine, 
amitripty- 
line), anticholinergics 
and K-opioid agonists” (ref. 149, 
p. 9). 
- There 
are numerous 
reports 
that the “relief 
of 
withdrawal is minimally effective in treating addiction” 
(ref. 365, p. 470 for references). 
- There is a high tendency to relapse even after an 
extended period of abstinence 
from drugs, long after 
overt withdrawal symptoms have subsided. This is usu- 
ally explained in the context of conditioned withdrawal 
effects, whereby environmental 
stimuli associated with 
withdrawal 
come 
to 
elicit 
withdrawal-like 
symp- 
toms306Y357. 
There are, however, a number of problems 
with this explanation. 
(1) At least a third of opiate 
addicts deny that they experience 
conditioned 
with- 
drawal symptoms when they are exposured to drug-re- 
lated stimuli5’. (2) Although many opiate addicts expe- 
rience conditioned 
withdrawal symptoms very few cite 
this as the reason for resuming drug use212. There is, in 
fact, a poor correlation 
between 
craving and with- 
drawal 
signs5’. Even 
withdrawal-like 
physiological 
symptoms induced by drug-associated 
cues (e.g., tem- 
perature, 
skin resistance, 
heart rate) are not highly 
correlated with reports of subjective state”. (3) Stewart 
et al. (ref. 326, p. 258) have argued that “attempts to 
demonstrate 
such conditioned 
withdrawal 
symptoms 
increase the probability of drug taking and relapse in 
animals have been unsuccessful” (ref. 329 as well).

- A number of researchers 
have noted that self-re- 
ported craving for some drugs, such as cocaine, is often 
highest immediately 
after drug administration, 
when 
the drug is producing subjective pleasure (a ‘high’) and 
withdrawal symptoms are eliminated 
or are at their 
weakest50~80~g6~98~150,215. 
If drug craving were due to a 
desire to relieve withdrawal 
symptoms (ref. 64 for 
example), 
it would be expected 
that craving would 
dramatically 
decrease when the drug alleviates with- 
drawal and is producing pleasure, not be sustained or 
even increase. 
- Finally, animals will avidly self-administer 
a variety 
of drugs directly into brain regions that do not produce 
withdrawal symptoms366. Furthermore, 
the infusion of 
drugs into these same brain regions can ‘prime’ or 
reinstate responding in animals in which drug respond- 
ing has been extinguished 326. These studies have estab- 
lished that the incentive motivational 
effects of cen- 
trally applied drugs can be dissociated from their nega- 
tive reinforcing or withdrawal-related 
effects. 
For the reasons summarized above it is now gener- 
ally accepted 
that the negative reinforcing 
effects of 
drugs are not necessary for the development 
and main- 
tenance 
of addictive behavior. 
Escape 
from distress 
cannot explain the defining characteristics 
of addiction, 
craving and relapse. We do not wish to imply, however, 
that withdrawal plays no role at all in the maintenance 
of addictive behavior. The alleviation 
of withdrawal 
distress may indeed sometimes motivate drug-seeking 
and drug-taking 
behavior. 
In addition, 
the positive 
reinforcing 
effects of drugs may be enhanced 
when 
drugs 
are 
given 
during 
periods 
of 
withdrawal 
distress*4*z90. However, 
relief from withdrawal syrnp- 
toms cannot be the sole cause or even the primary 
cause of drug craving and compulsive drug-taking be- 
havior. 
3.2. A positive 
reinforcement 
uiew 
of 
addiction 
~~e~~re-seek~ng~ 
In part because 
of the shortcomings 
of negative 
reinforcement 
theories of addiction more recent for- 
mulations have focussed on the role of drugs as posi- 
tive reinforcerst 148.326,349*363*365. 
Most drugs that are 
elf-administered 
by people also act as positive rein- 
forcers 
for animals. Thus, a positive reinforcement 
view of addiction posits that drug self-administration 
is 
maintained 
because 
of the state drugs induce, not 
because they alleviate an unpleasant state326V363,365. 
But to state that addictive drugs are positive rein- 
forcers does not explain addiction. As pointed out by 
Wise and Bozarth (ref. 365, p. 472): “To assert that all 
addictive drugs are reinforcers is to do little more than 
redefine the phenomenon 
of addiction.“... “To identify 
a drug as reinforcing goes no further than to identify 
the drug as addicting, because it is the Common obser- 
vation of habitual self-administration 
that serves as the 
basis for most definitions of both drug reinforcement 
and drug addiction. A theory of addiction based on the 
concept of reinforcement 
would have to identify ac- 
tions of drugs that are operationally 
independent 
of 
self-administration 
habits in order to offer insight as to 
why drugs are addictive.” That is, positive reinforce- 
ment is merely a description of a behavioral effect, not 
an explanation of the effect307. The critical questions 
are, why are some drugs positively reinforcing 
(Le., 
what specific actions of drugs are positively reinforc- 
ing) and why do drugs become more effective 
rein- 
forcers as addiction develops? 
It is usually assumed 
that drugs act as positive reinforcers 
because 
they 
produce 
pleasure. 
Thus, Wise and Bozarth 
state3h5 
“the only existing positive reinforcement 
view of addic- 
tion that might qualify as an explanatory theory identi- 
fies positive reinforcement 
with drug euphoria. In this 
view drugs are addicting (establish compulsive habits) 
because they produce euphoria or positive affect” (ref. 
29 and ref. 213, p. 474). Similarly, Stewart et a13*‘j 
argued 
that compulsive 
drug use is maintained 
by 
appetitive motivational states generated 
by the ability 
of drugs to produce positiue affective states?. 
There are, however, a number of problems with the 
hypothesis 
that the subjective pleasurable 
(hedonic) 
effects of drugs are either necessary or sufficient to 
motivate compulsive drug-seeking and drug-taking be- 
havior. As put by Dews72 over 15 years ago, “it was 
supposed that the prediction of addiction liability was 
essentially 
equivalent 
to prediction 
of euphorigenic 
power. As with most self-evident ideas, the mere mat- 
ter of there being essentially no evidence in favor of it 
and much against it, had little effect on its acceptance” 
(p. 75). 
3.2.1. Problems with a positive reinforcement /euphoria 
view of addition 
- If the positive reinforcing effects of drugs are primar- 
ily due to their ability to produce pleasurable affective 
states (euphoria?) 
and if this is sufficient to produce 
addictive behavior, the subjective pleasurabie effects of 
drugs must be enormous. Indeed, the subjective plea- 
surable effects of drugs would have to be so potent that 
just the memory of drug experiences 
would be suffi- 
cient to evoke compulsive drug-seeking and drug-tak- 
ing behavior. 
Although 
addictive 
drugs can indeed 
produce 
extremely 
pleasant 
affective 
states (anony- 
mous, personal co~~ication) 
it is difficult to believe 
that this property of drugs alone is sufficient to account 
for addiction. For one, there is no clear relationship 
between 
the ability of individual 
drugs to produce 


----- Page 7 (native text) -----
253 
euphoria 
and their addictive potential. 
For example, 
nicotine 
is considered 
highly addictive, but nicotine 
does not produce 
marked 
euphoria 
or other strong 
hedonic states (ref. 266 for example). Also, many ad- 
dictive drugs can actually produce 
strong dysphoric 
states, especially with initial use. Second, it could be 
argued that in addicts the magnitude of the negative 
consequences of continued drug use often far outweigh 
the magnitude of drug pleasure or the memory of drug 
pleasure. In fact, to most people (including many ad- 
dicts), the negative consequences 
of continued 
drug 
use, including loss of health, friends, family, home and 
job, seem enormous 
reIative to the pleasure 
derived 
from drugs. Falk et al. 86 have pointed out (p. 58): “the 
apparent irrationality of these activities [drug use]. The 
activities seem to produce more harm than benefit for 
the individual. How could creatures have evolved such 
powerful, wasteful and even self-destructive 
propensi- 
ties? Not only are the activities apparently 
irrational, 
but also an apparent disparity exists between the im- 
mediate consequences 
of the behavior and its strength. 
The rush of an intravenous 
injection is transient and 
with street-quality 
heroin, 
rarely dramatic. 
Yet, the 
drug somehow can support day-long hustling and de- 
termine a whole subculture”. 
Indeed, addicts will sometimes report that they are 
miserable, that their life is in ruins and that the drug is 
not even that great anymore - but they still want it! 
Addicts themselves often are bewildered by the inten- 
sity and irrationality of their own ‘wanting’. It is diffi- 
cult to explain this situation by just evoking short-last- 
ing drug pleasure. If the incentive motivational effects 
of drugs are due only to their ability to produce tran- 
sient pleasure, but the aversive consequences of contin- 
ued drug use eventually 
come to far outweigh the 
pleasurable 
effects - and, if drug taking behavior is 
maintained 
by simple contingencies 
of reinforcement, 
self-administration 
behavior should extinguish. But it 
usually does not (although 
see Falk et aLg6 for a 
discussion of the unique effects of intermittent 
sched- 
ules of reinforcement). 
- A positive reinfor~ement/euphoria 
view of addiction 
does not adequately 
explain drug craving or relapse 
elicited by environmental 
stimuli associated with drug 
taking. Both Stewart et a1.326 and Wise and Bozarth365 
have argued convincingly that drug-related 
stimuli can 
evoke ‘drug-like’ effects that serve to motivate further 
drug-seeking and drug-taking behavior. They recently 
termed 
this view a ‘proponent-process 
theory’329, in 
contrast with the ‘opponent-process’ 
view associated 
with negative reinforcement 
models’82*312. Stewart and 
Wise329 argue “it is drug-like processes 
rather than 
drug-opposite 
processes 
that whet the appetite 
and 
stimulate renewed responding. 
In this view it is the 
‘taste’ of the drug or the experience of stimuli that - 
through Pavlovian conditioning - cause drug-like cen- 
tral effects that motivate drug intake in experienced 
subjects” (p. 80). 
The question remains, however, what exactly is this 
‘drug-like process’? One possibility is that it resembles 
the 
positive 
affective 
state, 
the 
pleasurable 
state, 
evoked by the drug itself. That it is equivalent to what 
has been called a ~nditioned 
‘high”‘. For example, 
Stewart et al.326 say: ‘~Conditioned drug effects that 
mimic the unconditioned 
drug effects, as are condi- 
tioned positive affective states, are elicited by the envi- 
ronment where these drugs are experienced.” 
(p. 264, 
our italics). In this view drug-associated 
stimuIi may 
evoke ‘conditioned pleasure’, which reminds the addict 
of the even greater pleasure of the drug itself, thus 
motivating 
the individual to once again obtain the 
drug362. 
Addicts do report 
conditioned 
‘highs’, as in the 
example of the oft cited ‘needle freak’. In laboratory 
studies, however, 
seIf-reports 
of conditioned 
‘highs’ 
occur much less frequently 
than self-reports 
of either 
conditioned 
craving 
or conditioned 
withdrawal-Iike 
signs50*229. Self reports of conditioned craving are espe- 
cially frequent. This suggests that conditioned 
craving 
is dissociable from conditioned 
‘highs’ and therefore, 
in many instances, drug craving is not caused by a 
conditioned 
‘high’. How then is craving explained in 
the context of a positive reinforcement/euphoria 
view 
of addiction? 
A second ~ssibili~ 
is that relapse in a ‘recovered 
addict is triggered by cues that evoke an explicit mem- 
ory or representation 
of past drug experiences. Unlike 
a ‘conditioned high’, which is accompanied by an affec- 
tive experience 
similar to that produced 
by the drug 
itself, an explicit memory need not be pleasant in itself. 
It recalls past pleasure in a cognitive form, as a seman- 
tic proposition 
or as a conscious image of the act of 
drug taking and spurs the addict to attempt to regain 
the remembered 
experience of pleasure once again. 
An ‘explicit memos 
of past pleasure’ inte~retation 
of relapse is not implausible and may describe some 
instances of relapse. But an interpretation 
that posits 
explicit memories 
of taking drugs to be a sufficient 
cause for relapse finds it difficult to explain why re- 
lapse occurs only when it does. No addict who relapses 
after months or years of abstinence could possibly not 
have remembered 
drug experiences many times before. 
During the process of withdrawal every addict must 
often recall and dwell upon memories 
of the drug 
experience. 
Once ~thdrawal 
is successfully endured 
the circumstances 
of daily living would cause one to 


----- Page 8 (native text) -----
254 
sometimes remember 
earlier times, when life was dif- 
ferent 
and drugs were the focus. Even without any 
particular cue or reminder, 
the mere process of free 
association would often call to mind scenes from ear- 
lier life, including upon occasion, drug-related 
experi- 
ences. Why should the explicit memory 
of a drug 
experience 
suddenly be sufficient to trigger relapse, 
when a person has had innumerable 
previous memo- 
ries of drug experiences without relapse? 
An ‘explicit memory of past pleasure’ interpretation 
might reply that, because relapse is often triggered by 
particular situations that have been paired with drug 
use in the past, these situations evoke a memory that is 
more vivid than all the memories 
that have come 
before. Whether 
this is true or not is an empirical 
question. Certainly, vivid memories can be triggered by 
associative cues and there is ample evidence that asso- 
ciative context is a powerful modulator of conditioned 
behavior; although whether context modulates explicit 
memories in this way is less clear (ref. 259 for example). 
However, images or other forms of conscious remem- 
bering that occur during withdrawal, daiiy life or free 
association might also be expected to be fairly vivid at 
least some of the time. It is not intuitively obvious that 
these memories should necessarily differ in vividness or 
in any other subjective quality that might explain why 
some conscious memories provoke relapse when others 
do not. In other words, an ‘expiicit memory’ hypothesis 
places an extraordinary 
explanatory 
burden 
on the 
crucial assumption 
that relapse-provoking 
memories 
are qualitatively different from the myriad other mem- 
ories of drugs that do not provoke relapse. As far as we 
know, there is no evidence to support this assumption. 
- The most compelling evidence against the idea that 
drug taking is necessarily motivated by the subjective 
pleasurable effects of drugs comes from studies show- 
ing that drug self-administration 
can be maintained in 
the absence of subjective pleasure; that is, subjective 
pleasure is not necessary to maintain drug-seeking and 
drug-taking behavior. A striking example of a dissocia- 
tion between the incentive motivational effects of mor- 
phine and the subjective pleasurable 
effects of mor- 
phine was reported 
recently by Lamb et a1.t9*. These 
researchers found that opiate ‘postaddicts’ would work 
(press a lever) to get an injection of a low dose of 
morphine, 
despite the fact that four of five people 
could not distinguish the subjective effects of the mor- 
phine from 
the placebo 
- but the placebo 
did not 
reinforce 
lever pressing (ref. 151 as well). In other 
words, people ‘self-administered’ 
a low dose of mor- 
phine and not the placebo, but reported 
that neither 
the drug nor the placebo produced pleasure; there was 
no subjective difference between them. Similar effects 
have been reported 
by Fischman 
and Foltin’4*g5 in 
laboratory studies of cocaine self-administration 
behav- 
ior in humans. Cocaine users reliably choose a low 
dose of cocaine (4 mg) over placebo, although this dose 
produces no self-reported 
subjective effects or cardio- 
vascular effects. 
In addition, 
Fischman and FoltinY5 
report 
that within-session 
tolerance 
to many of the 
cardiovascular 
and subjective (euphoric) 
effects pro- 
duced by higher doses of cocaine is not accompanied 
by changes in drug-taking behavior; that is, within a 
self-administration 
session a dissociation develops be- 
tween the subjective effects of cocaine and cocaine 
seIf-administration 
behavior. 
On the basis of their study Lamb et a1.‘92 concluded 
“that the reinforcing effects of morphine can occur in the 
absence of self-reported subjective effects and thus, do 
no& appear to be causuaily related to drug-liking or 
euphoria” (p. 1172, our italics). Similarly, when asked 
to speculate what maintains the self-administration 
of 
cocaine in the absence of subjective pleasure Fisch- 
man95 replied: 
“I think cocaine is maintaining 
their behavior! 
If 
you want to know what the subjects say about their 
self-administration 
of these low doses, they tell me 
that they were not choosing cocaine over placebo. 
They often insist that they were sampling equally 
from each of the two choice options and both were 
placebo. On the other hand, if you look at the data 
from that session, you see that they were choosing 
the low dose (as low as 4 mg) or the dose with no 
measurable effect.“... “I do not believe that measur- 
ing subjective effects provides us with the informa- 
tion about ‘what’ is maintaining their cocaine-tak- 
ing. The best we can say at this point is that it is the 
cocaine that is maintaining cocaine-taking” 
(p. 179). 
Of course, these studies also suggest that a memory 
or representation 
of the subjective pleasurable 
effects 
of morphine 
or cocaine 
is not required 
to sustain 
drug-taking behavior either, because if that were true 
then there should be some subjective difference 
in 
memories during low-dose morphine or cocaine com- 
pared to the placebo and there was none. Clearly there 
is a difference between low-dose morphine or cocaine 
and the placebo, 
but the data suggest it is not a 
subjective difference; 
it is not explicit and does not 
have access to conscious awareness. 
Although the effects described by Lamb et a1.19’ and 
Fischman and Foltin95 are particularly striking, dissoci- 
ations between 
the subjective pleasurable 
effects of 
drugs and drug-taking behavior have been noted previ- 
ously. For example, Falk et al.@ review studies showing 
that “the subjective effects produced by a drug do not 
necessarily predict whether the drug actually will be 


----- Page 9 (native text) -----
255 
self-administered” 
(p. 58). In addition, Katz and Gold- 
berg 16~ describe experiments 
that suggest “the rein- 
forcing effects and the subjective reports by human 
volunteers 
are not functionally equivalent entities” (p. 
24). 
Similarly, studies in rats on the affective vs. reinforc- 
ing properties of opiates suggest these actions may be 
mediated by separable neural systems205,35s. This was 
suggested, for example, by White et al.355 on the basis 
of studies on the effects of morphine in a runway task, 
in which food was available in the goal box. They found 
that morphine 
acted as a strong positive reinforcer, 
leading to faster and faster running speeds. But at the 
same time animals learned to avoid morphine-paired 
food. Thus, “the aversive effects of morphine 
were 
accompanied by positive reinforcement, 
a paradox that 
is difficult to understand” 
(ref. 355, p. 66). White et 
al.355 suggested an explanation for this paradox may be 
“that the reinforming effects of mo~hine” 
do “not 
depend upon the affective properties of the drug, but 
that the drug directly activate(s) a neural mechanism of 
reinforcement, 
which facilitates iearning independantly 
of the animal’s affective state”. 
The studies cited above are very important because 
their findings directly contradict the central premise of 
a positive reinforcement/euphoria 
view of addiction. 
In our terms, they establish that the incentive motiva- 
tionai effects of drugs are not directly attributable 
to 
their subjective pleasurable effects: that is, drug ‘want- 
ing’ is not equivalent to drug ‘liking’. 
In summary, both negative reinforcement 
(e.g., with- 
drawal 
avoidance) 
and 
positive 
reinforcement,/ 
euphoria 
(pleasure-seeking) 
views of addiction 
have 
difficulty explaining a number of important features of 
addictive behavior. Any plausible new theory of addic- 
tion needs to address the same issues and better ex- 
plain them. Specifically, an adequate theory of addic- 
tion must explain: 
(1) What accounts for drug craving elicited by drug-as- 
sociated stimuli, if craving is not causally related to 
conditioned 
~thdrawal 
signs, conditioned 
‘highs’ or 
the explicit memory of past pleasure? 
(2) Why is craving sometimes highest immediately after 
drug administration, 
when subjective pleasurable 
ef- 
fects are still predominant? 
(3) Why does obsessive craving for drugs persist in the 
face of enormous 
negative 
consequences 
associated 
with continued drug use, and relatively modest subjec- 
tive pleasurable effects? 
(4) HOW can low doses of drugs, which do not produce 
discernible subjective pleasure or physical dependence, 
maintain drug-seeking and drug-taking behavior? 
(5) Why is relapse 
such a prevalent 
and persistent 
feature of addiction, even in ‘recovered’ addicts? 
(6) Why can relapse be precipitated 
by so many differ- 
ent stimuli (drugs, environmental 
stimuli associated 
with drugs, mood changes)? 
3.3. Requirements of an Incentive-Sensitization Theuv of 
~~~~cti~n 
Neither traditional positive reinforcement 
nor nega- 
tive reinforcement 
theories of addiction provide com- 
pelling answers to the questions listed above. We will 
argue below that the Inventive-Sensitization 
Theory of 
Addiction does. The Incentive-Sensitization 
Theory was 
introduced 
as a ‘neuroadaptationist’ 
model. It posits 
that repeated 
intermittent 
drug use results in incre- 
mental and persistent changes in a neural system that 
mediates craving for drugs; to be more precise, in a 
neural system responsible for the attribution 
of incen- 
tive salience (not pleasure) to stimuli. We first need to 
ask, therefore, 
whether there is any experimental 
evi- 
dence that repeated 
exposure to addictive drugs can 
produce neuroadaptations 
that meet the relevant crite- 
ria. The criteria required of such neuroadaptations 
in 
order for the theory to be true include the following: 
(1) To the extent that the excessive incentive salience 
elicited by drugs is mediated by a common substrate, 
there should be a common neural system affected by 
many different addictive drugs. 
(2) To explain the progressive development of addictive 
behavior repeated 
drug administration 
should render 
this neural 
system hypersensitive 
in a gradual and 
incremental 
fashion. 
(3) To explain the persistence of relapse these drug-in- 
duced neuroadaptations 
should persist for very long 
periods 
of time (if not permanently) 
following the 
discontinuation 
of drug use. 
(4) To explain the role of drug-associated 
stimuli in 
relapse the expression of these neuroadaptations 
should 
be susceptible to conditioned 
stimulus or environmen- 
tal control. 
(5) To explain drug craving the activation of this neural 
system should mediate the incentive motivational 
ef- 
fects of drugs and drug-related 
stimuli and the neu- 
roadaptations 
produced 
by drugs should ~tentiate 
these motivational effects. 
(6) To explain the dissociation between drug ‘wanting’ 
and drug ‘liking’ this neural system should not directly 
mediate the subjective pleasurable 
effects of drugs or 
the subjective pleasure associated with other stimuli. 
Evidence 
that the repeated 
use of a number of 
different 
addictive drugs does indeed produce 
neu- 
roadaptations 
that meet each of these criteria is pre- 
sented next.

4. EVIDENCE FOR THE INCENTIVE-SENSITIZATION 
THEORY OF ADDICTION 
4.1. Criterion 1: there should be a common neural system 
affected by many different addictive drugs 
Addictive drugs represent 
a diverse group of com- 
pounds that markedly differ in their behavioral 
and 
neurochemical 
actions. Nevertheless, 
there is increas- 
ing evidence that many addictive drugs share the abili~ 
to enhance 
mesotelencephalic 
dopamine 
neurotrans- 
mission733365. This evidence has been reviewed recently 
and need not be reiterated 
here. Suffice it, to say that 
the following drugs have been reported 
to increase 
dopamine neurotransmission 
in the nucleus accumbens 
and dorsal striatum: amphetamine 
(‘speed’), cathinone 
What’), 
cocaine (‘coke’; ‘crack’), methamphetamine 
(‘ice’; 
“crystal meth’), 
methylenedio~amphetamine 
(MDA; 
‘the 
love 
drug’); 
methylenedioxymetham- 
phetamine 
(MDMA; 
‘ecstasy’), 
methylphenidate~ 
ethanol, 
fentany1 (‘China white’), methadone, 
mor- 
phine, nicotine and phencyclidine 
(PCP; ‘angel dust’). 
This common action of diverse drugs is consistent with 
the h~othesis 
that mesotelencephalic 
dopamine 
sys- 
tems mediate, at least in part, the incentive motiva- 
tional properties of many different drugs of abuse362,363. 
Although it cannot be said that there is a single neural 
system that is affected by all addictive drugs, dopamine 
systems and their associated structures are affected by 
most 
179,363,365 
4.2. Criterion 2: the repeated admin~tration of dinerent 
addictive drugs should render a common neural system 
h~~rse~it~ve in a caddy 
and incremental f~h~~ 
Drug effects are known to change when drugs are 
given repeatedly, and some of these changes are known 
involve adaptations 
in neural elements mediating spe- 
cific drug effects 
. 
148 Much of the emphasis in the past 
has been on homeostatic neuroadaptations 
thought to 
underly 
the development 
of tolerance 
and to con- 
tribute to withdrawal symptoms. But as discussed above, 
tolerance and withdrawal do not account for the defin- 
ing characteristics 
of addiction and therefore, tolerance 
and withdrawal-ass~iated 
neuroadaptations 
do not 
meet Criterion 2 under discussion here. 
4.2.1. Sensitization to the psychomotor-activating effects 
of addictive drugs. However, some effects of drugs are 
not decreased, 
but are actually increased by repeated 
~nte~i~ent 
drug a~inistration. 
Indeed, for a given 
drug, some effects may decrease (show tolerance) while 
simultaneously other effects increase. This latter phe- 
nomenon has been referred to as behavioral sensitiza-

. We will use the 
term ‘sensitization’ here. 
Psychomotor stimulant drugs, such as amphetamine 
or cocaine, have been used in the majority of studies 
on drug-induced 
sensitization, and the effects of these 
drugs have been we11 characterized’88.250~257~269~272~r91~354, 
For example, 
the acute administration 
of a low-to- 
moderate 
dose of amphetamine 
or cocaine produces 
‘psychomotor 
activation’, characterized 
by an increase 
in locomotor 
activity (ambulation), 
rearing 
behavior 
and rotational 
behavior267. Higher doses result in the 
emergence 
of focussed stereotyped 
behaviors, such as 
repetitive head movements and sniffing and a resultant 
decrease 
in locomotion 
and rearing2s4*z84. The re- 
peated intermittent 
administration 
of a constant, rela- 
tively low dose, produces 
a progressive 
increase 
in 
drug-induced 
locomotor stimulation with each succes- 
sive administration. 
Repeated administration 
of a mod- 
erate dose will come to elicit the stereotyped 
behavior 
typical of a higher dose, even though it produced only 
ambulation 
the first time it was given. Furthermore, 
sensitization-related 
changes in behavior can come un- 
der strong conditioned 
stimulus control and this fea- 
ture of sensitization is discussed in more detail below. 
In summary, it is the gradual and incremental increase 
in drug-induced 
‘psychomotor 
activation’ 
and 
the 
emergence of increasingly stereotyped behavior, that is 
usually referred 
to as ‘behavioral 
sensitization’. 
The 
only comparable stimulant effect that has been charac- 
terized in humans is sensitization to the psychotogenic 
effects of amphetamine 
and cocaine~“,z72,2~~~2~7. 
Behavioral sensitization is produced by the repeated 
administration 
of many 
different 
psychomotor 
sti- 
mulants, 
including 
the ~phetaminess.1~*,272,292, co- 
cainei603250, methylphenidate40,177,3~‘, fencamfamine” 
and the endogenous 
trace amine, phenylethylamine35. 
The phenomenon 
is not limited, however, to classical 
psychomotor 
stimuIants. Other drugs, not traditionally 
considered 
psychomotor 
stimulants, also produce psy- 
chomotor 
activation, 
enhance 
dopamine 
neurotrans- 
mission 
and 
produce 
behavioral 
sensitization73,“65. 
These 
include: 
opioids”*‘53*302, nicotineZ5*52*171~186, 
phencyclidineil6,117,'47,225, ethano158,61.'"4~208'20Y and 
MDMA316 (cf. Note 7 in Ch 6) 
. 
. 
Repeated 
inte~ittent 
treatment 
with an addictive 
drug not oniy produces sensitization to that drug, but 
may also produce 
cross-sensitization 
to other drugs. 
Although 
the literature 
is not entirely 
consistent, 
cross-sensitization 
has been reported between drugs in 
the same class (e.g., amphetamine 
and cocaine) and 
between drugs in different classes (e.g., stimulants and 
opjoids)iS9,~6O~~68. Furthermore, 
cross-sensitization 
is 
also found between drugs and stress, which led to the 


----- Page 11 (native text) -----
257 
suggestion that drugs may induce sensitization by their 
action as stressors8*9*a9. Evidence for crow-sensitiza- 
tion between 
drugs and stress comes from studies 
showing that animals pretreated 
with drugs like am- 
phetamine, cocaine or morphine are later hyperrespon- 
sive to stress and vice versa, animals sensitized to stress 
are hyperresponsive 
to a drug challenge8~9i’~~190~194~z6~. 
Even the repeated 
adm~istration 
of exogenous corti- 
costerone 
is reported 
to increase the locomotor 
re- 
sponse to a later challenge with amphetamine” 
(see 
also Note 9 in Ch. 61. 
4.2-2. Se~it~~ti~~ CO the i~ce~tiue ~~tiu~~i~nu~ erects 
of drugs. Of more direct relevance to the process of 
addiction 
are recent 
studies on sensitization 
to the 
incentive 
motivational 
properties 
of addictive drugs. 
There has been relatively little research on this topic, 
but there have been a number of recent experiments, 
using either self-adm~istration 
procedures or the con- 
ditioned place preference 
paradigm, which suggest that 
prior exposure to amphetamine, 
cocaine or morphine 
produces 
sensitization 
to the incentive 
motivational 
effects of these drugs. 
In one of the first reports of this kind Woolverton et 
a1.373 found that rhesus monkeys would self-administer 
a low dose of methamphetamine 
only after they had 
received 
a regimen 
of non-contingent 
injections 
of 
methamphetamine. 
That is, the threshold dose neces- 
sary to sustain 
self-administration 
was lowered 
by 
methamphetam~e 
pretreatment, 
suggesting 
“an in- 
creased sensitivity to the reinforcing properties 
of the 
drug” (p. 740). There are now a number of similar 
reports 
in rats 241. For example, 
Piazza and his co- 
workers”‘*2q3 have reported 
that ~-amphetamine 
pre- 
treatment, which induces behavioral sensitization, facil- 
itates the later acquisition of an amphetamine 
self-ad- 
ministration 
habit, especially in animals not predis- 
posed to self-administer 
amphetamine. 
Similarly, pre- 
treatment 
with cocaine facilitates the later acquisition 
of a cocaine self-administration 
habiti3’. 
Sensit~ation 
has also been observed with the condi- 
tioned place preference 
paradigm, in which the place 
where a drug is experienced 
becomes preferred 
by an 
animal in subsequent choice tests. For example, Lett’% 
examined the influence 
of amphet~~e, 
cocaine or 
morphine 
pretreatment 
on the later acquisition of a 
conditioned 
place preference 
produced 
by the same 
drug. For all three drugs, pretreated 
(sensitized) ani- 
mals showed a significantly enhanced conditioned place 
preference, 
relative to control animals. A similar effect 
has 
been 
reported 
following 
pretreatment 
with 
mo~hinelo2 
or ethano1114. 
Cross-sensitization 
also occurs in these situations. 
Animals pretreated 
with amphetamine 
show an en- 
hanced place preference 
for morphine, animals pre- 
treated with mo~hine 
show an enhanced place prefer- 
ence for cocaine and animals pretreated 
with morphine 
show an enhanced 
place 
preference 
for amphet- 
aminelg5. These latter findings suggest that the en- 
hancement 
of the conditioned 
place preference 
is not 
due to tolerance 
to the drug’s aversive properties, 
because cross-tolerance 
does not occur between the 
stimulants and mo~hine19’. 
Similarly, cross-sensitiza- 
tion has been found using self-administration 
proce- 
dures. Noncontingent 
pretreatment 
with amphetamine, 
caffeine or nicotine facilitates the later acquisition of 
cocaine self-a~inistration136-138,~2. 
An especially in- 
triguing example of cross-sensitization 
between opiates 
and amphetamine 
was reported 
recently by Cunning- 
ham and JSelley62. These researchers 
found that the 
repeated intra-accumbens 
application of a mu receptor 
agonist (morphine or DAMGO) for 4 days potentiated 
(sensitized) 
the ability of systemic amphetamine 
to 
later enhance responding for a conditioned reinforcer; 
i.e., a light/tone 
previously paired with food. 
it was mentioned 
above that cross-sensitization 
to 
the psychomotor-activating 
effects of drugs can occur 
not only between drugs, but between drugs and stress. 
Therefore, 
the effects of prior stress on the incentive 
motivational 
effects of drugs are also of interest. In- 
deed, prior stress (tail pinch) facilitates the acquisition 
of an amphetamine self-administration 
habit243. In fact, 
a number of potentially stressful environmental 
manip- 
ulations, such as social isolation or prenatal stress, are 
reported 
to increase sensitivity to amphetamine 
and 
facilitate amphetamine 
or cocaine self-administration 
behavior68$‘52*281. 
In conclusion, these studies establish that not only 
are the ‘psychomotor-activating’ 
properties of addictive 
drugs sensitized by repeated 
drug administration, 
but 
their incentive motivational properties are sensitized as 
well. Animals sensitized to amphetamine, 
cocaine or 
morphine 
later show an enhanced 
preference 
for an 
environment 
associated with drug administration 
and 
animals sensitized to amphetamine 
or cocaine show 
enhanced vulnerability to acquire a drug self-adminis- 
tration habit. Obviously, sensitization 
to the incentive 
motivational 
properties 
of drugs (and drug-related 
stimuli) could have a profound influence on the devel- 
opment 
of addictive behavior. 
With more-and-more 
drug experience the incentive value of the act of drug_ 
taking and of drug-related 
stimuli would be progres- 
sively enhanced, which would increase the probability 
of repeating dig-seeking 
and dug-taking 
behavior in 
the future (although, see Note 1 in Ch. 6 for a discus- 
sion of the role of response contingency in drug sensiti- 
zation).

4.2.3. The neural basis of behavioral sensitization. The 
behavioral studies summarized above strongly suggest 
that the repeated 
administration 
of many different 
addictive drugs produces gradual and incremental neu- 
roadaptations 
that render 
animals hypersensitive 
to 
these agents. The behavioral studies also provide prima 
facie evidence that sensitization-related 
neuroadapta- 
tions involve a hypersensitivity 
in mesotelencephalic 
dopamine systems. A change in dopamine neurotrans- 
mission is implicated for a number of reasons. First, 
the behaviors that are sensitized by addictive drugs are 
known to involve an activation of mesotelencephalic 
dopamine systems. There is considerable evidence that 
both the psychomotor-activating 
effects and the incen- 
tive motivational 
effects of many of these drugs re- 
quires the integrity of mesotelencephalic 
dopamine 
systems, especially dopamine projections to the ventral 
striatum362. Second, the activation of dopamine 
sys- 
tems appears to be necessary to induce sensitization. 
The sensitization 
produced 
by amphetamine, 
cocaine 
or 
morphine 
is prevented 
by co-treatment 
with 
dopamine antagonists’2’.‘87.344*345’352 
(see ref. 160 for a 
review) and amphetamine 
sensitization is prevented by 
a 6-OHDA 
lesion293. Third, the application 
of am- 
phetamine 
or morphine 
directly 
into 
the 
ventral 
tegmental 
area, where dopamine 
cell bodies are lo- 
cated, induces sensitization’60. Fourth, 
a local ‘chal- 
lenge’ injection 
of amphetamine 
into 
the 
lateral 
ventricle*” 
or nucleus accumbens’78,233 evokes a sensi- 
tized behavioral response in animals treated previously 
with systemic amphetamine. 
Perhaps even more importantly, 
behavioral sensiti- 
zation is accompanied by changes in mesotelencephalic 
dopamine 
activity ‘60*2s7,269.272,354. 
For 
example, 
am- 
phetamine sensitization is accompanied by an increase 
in amphetamine-stimulated 
dopamine 
release 
from 
striatal tissue in vitro48~‘7h~‘78~27’~358*375. 
More recently, 
in vivo microdialysis studies have shown that although 
amphetamine 
sensitization 
is not 
accompanied 
by 
changes 
in the basal extracellular 
concentration 
of 
dopamine, it is associated with an enhanced dopamine 
response to a drug challenge’44~‘66*23’~269~274.“7” 
(cf. ref. 
295). Even the local application of amphetamine 
into 
the ventral 
tegmental 
area sensitizes the dopamine 
release produced 
by a subsequent 
systemic challenge 
with 
amphetamine347. 
A similar 
enhancement 
in 
dopamine response has also been reported in associa- 
tion with sensitization 
to cocaine5”57,‘67*236V238 
(cf. ref. 
296) 
ethano124, nicotine25*10’*‘23 (cf. ref. 65) 
mor- 
phine’SJv’60 (cf. ref. 
155), phenylethylamine1s9 
and 
methylphenidate’77 
and following 
cross-sensitization 
between different drugs4,‘59,‘66 and between drugs and 
stress’sh~‘s9~‘6”~3’5~32~~~sx. 
Furthermore, 
co-treatment 
with 
a dopamine 
receptor 
antagonist, which prevents 
the 
induction 
of behavioral 
sensitization 
to 
mctham- 
phetamine, 
also attenuates the dopaminergic 
response 
to a methamphetamine 
challenge assessed with micro- 
dialysis 
. 
I” 
Although there is no convincing evidence 
for sensitization-related 
changes in dopamine receptor 
binding 272, there is electrophysiological 
evidence for an 
increased sensitivity of nucleus accumbens neurons to 
iontophoretically 
applied dopamine 
in cocaine sensi- 
tized rats’24,354. It is possible, therefore, 
that sensitiza- 
tion produced 
by cocaine and amphetamine 
is also 
accompanied 
by changes 
in the 
transduction 
of 
dopamine receptor-mediated 
events’5~“2~‘24*‘40~265~27h. 
The 
biophysical 
basis 
of 
sensitization-related 
changes in dopamine neurotransmission 
is not known. 
There have been a number of hypotheses 
proposed, 
including changes in autoreceptor 
sensitivity, changes 
in the intraneuronal 
distribution 
of dopamine 
lead- 
ing to enhanced release, changes in the dopamine up- 
take 
carrier 
and changes 
in transduction 
mecha- 
ni~m~6,160,18X,226,269,354. 
it 
IS not known, however, whether 
the behavioral sensitization produced by different drugs 
involves the same or different 
cellular and molecular 
changes. Even the processes involved in the induction 
of sensitization 
differ from those involved in the ex- 
pression of sensitization ‘h0*233*2h9. 
Furthermore, 
sensiti- 
zation-related 
changes in dopamine systems have been 
emphasized here because only dopamine systems have 
been studied in any detail. But neuroadaptations 
in 
other 
neurotransmitter 
systems 
that 
interact 
with 
dopamine systems must also be considered. For exam- 
ple, glutamate systems have been implicated in recent 
studies 
showing 
that 
glutamate 
antagonists, 
like 
dopamine antagonists, prevent the induction of sensiti- 
~,~~~~161,‘63~1M~369 
In summary, there is considerable 
experimental 
evi- 
dence in support of Criterion 2. The repeated adminis- 
tration of many different addictive drugs produces be- 
havioral sensitization 
and behavioral 
sensitization 
is 
associated with hypersensitive mesotelencephalic 
dopa- 
mine systems. 
4.3. Criterion 3: sensitization-related neuroadaptations 
should be very long-lasting 
One 
of 
the 
most 
striking 
characteristics 
of 
sensitization 
is its persistence. 
A 
single 
injec- 
tion of amphetamine, 
cocaine 
or morphine 
indu- 
ces behavioral 
sensitization 
lasting 
for weeks 
to 
months40,197,236,237~267,302 
and animals sensitized with es- 
calating doses of amphetamine 
remain behaviorally 
hypersensitive 
to an amphetamine 
challenge 
for at 
least 1 year 
. 
232 In fact, Paulson et al. 232 found that rats 
were just as sensitized a year following the discontinua- 


----- Page 13 (native text) -----
259 
tion of amphetamine 
pretreatment, 
which is over one 
third of their life-span, as they were at 2-4 weeks. 
These findings suggest that after at least some pre- 
treatment 
regimens the neuroadaptations 
responsible 
for behavioral 
sensitization 
to amphetamine 
may be 
essentially permanent. 
Similarly, behavioral 
sensitiza- 
tion in rats is reported 
to persist for over 3 months 
following pretreatment 
with cocaine-, 
for over 50 
days following pretreatment 
with methylphenidate3’i 
and for over 8 months following pretreatment 
with 
morphine’L”7,302_ 
It is not known if sensitization 
to the incentive 
motivational properties 
of drugs persists for as long as 
sensitization 
to their psychomotor-activating 
effects, 
but this is obviously an important issue for the Incen- 
tive-sensitization 
Theory. To the extent that sensitiza- 
tion to the psychomotor-activating 
effects and the in- 
centive motivational 
effects of drugs have a ~mmon 
neural basis we would expect both effects to show 
comparable 
persistence. 
Neither 
have neurochemical 
studies been conducted as long as a year following drug 
pretreatment. 
But 
sensitization-related 
changes 
in 
dopamine 
systems have been reported 
to persist for 
months after withdrawa126p*272. The available evidence 
suggests, therefore, 
that the neuroadaptations 
underly- 
ing behavioral sensitization meet the criterion of per- 
sistence. 
4.4. Criterion 4: the expression of sensitizut~~-related 
neuroadaptations 
should be amenable 
to conditioned 
stimulus control 
The 
Incentive-Sensitization 
Theory 
of Addiction 
posits that drugs sensitize a neural system that medi- 
ates ‘wanting’. It is also hypothesized 
that associative 
processes focus exaggerated ‘wanting’ (craving) specifi- 
cally onto drug-related 
stimuli. This implies that the 
behavioral expression of sensitization-related 
neuroad- 
aptations should be strongly influenced by associative 
factors. 
Indeed, 
the environmental 
context in which drugs 
are experienced 
can have profound 
effects on the 
development and expression of sensitization. Stewart323 
recently 
reviewed the literature 
on the conditioned 
stimulus control of sensitization 
and the reader is re- 
ferred to this paper for a more detailed and excellent 
discussion of such issues. In brief, Stewart323 points 
out that the conditioned 
stimulus control of sensitiza- 
tion can take one of two basic forms, depending 
to 
some extent on experimental 
design. In one design the 
drug (the UCS), which produces 
a pha~acologi~al 
effect (the UCR), is given only in association with 
unique environmental 
cues (CS). After repeated 
pair- 
ing of the UCS and CS, the CS alone can acquire the 
ability to elicit drug-like responses (CR). For example, 
after 
repeated 
administration 
of a dose 
of am- 
phetamine 
that produces locomotor 
h~eracti~~, 
just 
placing an animal in the environment in which it previ- 
ously received amphetamine 
is sufficient to produce 
conditioned 
locomotor hyperactivity, 
in the absence of 
any drug. A number 
of researchers 
have reported 
dug-environment 
conditioning 
of this type and have 
suggested these conditioned 
effects contribute 
to the 
development of sensitization’28~283*323 
(see ref. 338 for a 
review). 
A second type of conditioned 
stimulus control of 
sensitization is the situation where, after explicit pair- 
ing of a drug and specific test environment, animals are 
administered 
a ‘challenge’ injection 
of the drug in 
either the drug-paired 
environment 
or in a new envi- 
ronment. In this case one observes the effect of the CS 
(the environments 
on the response to the UCS (the 
drug). In some experiments of this type the expression 
of sensitization has come under complete conditioned 
stimulus control. For example, Post et al.25’ reported 
that rats given ten daily injections of 10 mg/kg 
of 
cocaine in a test environment 
showed a progressively 
greater behavioral 
response (locomotor 
activations to 
the drug, but animals given daily ‘injections of cocaine 
in their home cage did not show evidence of behavioral 
sensitization 
when subsequently 
challenged 
with co- 
caine in the test environment. 
Similarly, Vezina and 
Stewart344 reported 
that repeated 
injections of mor- 
phine into the ventral tegmental 
area produced 
evi- 
dence of sensitization on a subsequent challenge test 
only when rats were tested in the environment 
where 
they received morphine. 
In addition, the conditioned 
stimulus control of sensitization may not only enhance 
the expression of sensitization in drug-paired environ- 
ments, but may also inhibit the expression of sensitiza- 
tion in environments 
that predict the absence of the 
drug. For example, Vezina and Stewart344 found that 
the lo~motor 
response to an intra-ventra1 te~entai 
area challenge injection of morphine in explicitly un- 
paired animals was significantly depressed 
relative to 
saline-pretreated 
controls (also see ref. 328). Neverthe- 
less, sensitization 
is not only a conditioned 
response, 
even though the expression of sensitization can come 
under strong conditioned stimulus control, a point that 
has been made by a number of authors40*210,272*323,346. 
Our discussion of the conditioned 
stimulus control 
of sensitization has focused thus far on the effects of 
drug-associated 
stimuli on the subsequent response to 
drugs. It is important to know, however, whether envi- 
ronmental stimuli associated with drugs can also influ- 
ence the response 
to other 
incentive 
stimuli; even 
non-drug-related 
stimuli. This issue has received al- 


----- Page 14 (native text) -----
260 
most no experimental 
attention, despite its theoretical 
importance. Nevertheless, it was addressed in one study 
by Mitchell and Stewart 218 In this study male rats were 
. 
given morphine 
either in a test arena or their home 
cage, every other day for four injections. All rats were 
then placed in the test arena in the presence 
of a 
receptive female. Rats pretreated 
with morphine in the 
test arena showed more frequent female-directed 
be- 
haviors than either rats pretreated 
with morphine in 
their home cage or saline-pretreated 
controls. 
The 
enhancement 
of sexual behavior 
produced 
by the 
drug-associated environment did not involve changes in 
copulatory behavior per se, but only in the appetitive 
behaviors leading to copulation, 
including more fre- 
quent “pursuit of the female, anogenital 
exploration 
and partial mounts and... shorter latencies to initiate 
copulation” 
(p. 367). That is, the female appeared 
to 
be a more salient incentive stimulus in male rats tested 
in the presence 
of morphine-associated 
cues. These 
results suggest that sensitization to drugs may change 
neural systems that not only modulate 
the incentive 
properties of drug-associated 
stimuli, but the incentive 
properties 
of ‘natural incentives’+. This is important 
because 
it implies that drug-associated 
stimuli may 
potentially influence a wide range of motivated behav- 
iors. 
To summarize thus far, we have addressed the first 
four criteria, and reviewed evidence to establish that: 
(1) Many different addictive drugs activate a common 
neural system, the mesotelencephalic 
dopamine 
sys- 
tem; (2) Repeated 
administration 
of many addictive 
drugs causes dopamine systems to become hypersensi- 
tive and this is accompanied 
by a gradual and incre- 
mental 
increase 
(sensitization) 
in the psychomotor- 
activating 
and incentive 
motivational 
properties 
of 
drugs; (3) The neuroadaptations 
underlying sensitiza- 
tion are extremely persistent; and (4) The expression of 
sensitization is subject to conditioned stimulus control. 
We next need to address Criteria 5 and 6. Criterion 
5 requires 
that the neural system sensitized by re- 
peated treatment 
with addictive drugs normally medi- 
ate the incentive 
motivational 
effects of drugs and 
drug-related 
stimuli. Criterion 6 requires that this neu- 
ral system not mediate the subjective pleasurable 
ef- 
fects of drugs or the pleasure 
associated with other 
stimuli. 
4.5. Criterion 5: the role of mesotelencephalic dopamine 
systems in incentive motivation 
There is a wealth of evidence implicating dopamine 
systems in the incentive motivational? effects of drugs, 
as well as of food, 
sex and other 
natural 
incen- 
tives19,84,~,‘“‘,262,263,356,365,368 
(cf. ref. ISI). For example, 
signals predicting the availability of food, water or a 
sexual partner 
activate brain dopamine 
systems, in- 
creasing dopamine 
neurotransmission 
in the ventral 
striatum5’~hh~‘26~246~376. 
Addictive 
drugs also increase 
dopamine neurotransmission73. 
Indeed, in the case of 
drugs, a direct action on dopamine 
systems alone is 
sufficient to motivate behavior. Animals will work for 
microinjections 
of drugs directly into appropriate 
por- 
tions of the mesotelencephalic 
dopamine 
system3@‘. 
Furthermore, 
microinjections 
of 
amphetamine 
or 
dopamine 
directly into the nucleus accumbens facili- 
tates responding 
for conditioned 
incentive 
stimuli? 
(conditioned 
reinforcers) 
- stimuli that have acquired 
incentive properties 
by association with a natural in- 
centivets5,262,263. In short, a common neural currency 
for many incentives appears to be activation of mesote- 
lencephalic dopamine systems (see Note 4 in Ch. 6). 
Consistent with this idea are studies showing that 
the motivational 
properties 
of natural incentives and 
addictive drugs are attenuated 
by decreasing dopamine 
activity 
. 
360 Antagonist drugs that prevent the activation 
of dopamine receptors or the complete destruction of 
mesotelencephalic 
dopamine 
projections 
by neuro- 
chemically 
selective 
toxins, impair the instrumental 
performance 
of animals for food, for drugs and for 
electrical brain stimulation. A great deal of effort has 
been directed 
towards ascertaining 
whether 
the sup- 
pression 
of dopamine 
neurotransmission 
produces 
changes in behavior because of effects on the control 
of movement or because of effects on incentive motiva- 
tion and a variety of experimental paradigms have been 
developed 
to distinguish between motor and motiva- 
tional effects (see Note 2 in Ch. 6). It is now generally 
accepted that dopamine 
antagonists can have effects 
on behavior that are truly motivational. This is not to 
say they may not also have effects that are ‘motor’, but 
in many cases the effect on behavior is precisely what 
one would expect if dopamine antagonism reduced the 
motivational properties of incentives82,3ho.36’. 
In summary, 
the large literature 
on the role of 
dopamine 
in mediating the incentive motivational 
ef- 
fects of drugs and other stimuli satisfies Criterion 5.

systems

mediate the subjective pleasure produced by food, 
drugs, electrical brain stimulation, etc. and that 
dopamine antagonists suppress the pleasure produced 
by these agents. The anhedonia hypothesis provided a 
parsimonious explanation of dopamine’s motivational 
effects by equating it with the psychological process of 
subjective pleasure *. 
If the motivational properties of natural incentive 
stimuli or drugs depended only on their ability to 
produce 
subjective pleasure, then the effects of 
dopamine manipulations on motivated behavior would 
be com~lling evidence for the anhedonia hypothesis+ 
We suggest, however, that incentive motivation de- 
pends on a number of additional psychological pro- 
cesses that interact with pleasure: including associative 
learning and the attribution of incentive salience to 
external events and their representations27,~. It is the 
entire complex of pleasure, learning and incentive 
salience? together that comprise the process of incen- 
tive motivationt. 
45.2. Incentt’ve saltence. Of particular importance to 
the Incentive-Sensit~ation Theory of Addiction are the 
relative roles of ‘wanting’ and ‘liking’ in incentive 
motivation. The idea that there may be a psychological 
process (and neural substrate) responsible for ‘want- 
ing’ incentives that is dissociable from the psychologi- 
cal process (and neural substrate) responsible for ‘lik- 
ing’ incentives has not been considered explicitly in 
previous theories of incentive motivation3**339?* 
*. Eased 
on a series of studies on the relationship between taste 
pleasure and appetite, such a dissociation was recently 
proposed27,28. Berridge and his colleagues hypothe- 
sized that a psychological process specifically involving 
the attribution of salience to incentive stimuli (incen- 
tive salience) results in the experience of ‘wanting’. 
This view of incentive motivation posits that salience 
attribution is a specific psychological process that is 
activated normally in conjunction with pleasure (‘lik- 
ing’) and associative learning in the creation of new 
incentives. As new incentives are acquired particular 
stimuli that allow an individual to recognize an incen- 
tive (e.g., the sight of food; in nature, a flowering plant 
that signals the av~labili~ of food; or, in the Iabora- 
tory, a tone that predicts food), become associated with 
the pleasure food produces by the process of classical 
261 
conditioning. The stimulus features of the incentive 
predict the pleasure that will follow and may elicit 
conditioned pleasure. But conditioned stimulus fea- 
tures also become themselves the target of a separate 
and powerful motivational process - salience attribu- 
tion Salience attribution transforms the sensory fea- 
tures of the incentive stimulus into an especially salient 
percept, which ‘grabs attention’, becomes attractive 
and ‘wanted’ and thus guides behavior to the incentive. 
That is, new incentives become attractive in their own 
right as conditioned incentives? (also called condi- 
tioned or secondary reinforcers). 
Thus, the role of salience attribution in incentive 
motivation is proposed to occur as the third stage of a 
three-stage process (see Fig. 2). First, pleasure is nor- 
mally activated by an encounter with a natural incen- 
tive, such as when an hungry animal eats food. In the 
normal course of events, pleasure is a necessary step in 
the establishment of a new conditioned incentive. 
However, pleasure (‘liking’) is not by itself sufficient to 
motivate behavior2’. Pleasure by itself has no object or 
action, Assignment of pleasure to something requires 
associative learning, which is the second stage in the 
formation of incentives. 
If pleasure is assigned to an action or stimulus by 
associative learning, then the action or stimulus should 
come to predict pleasure or elicit pleasure, on its own. 
No doubt this often happens. But we would argue that 
neither the experience of pleasure nor the expectation 
of impending pleasure by themselves constitute ‘want- 
ing ‘27V28. 
‘Wanting’ requires an additional process: the 
attribution of incentive salience to stimuli or actions. 
Stimuli that are attributed with incentive salience be- 
come attractive and demand attention. Like the sight 
of food to a starving person, they cannot be ignored. 
This does not necessarily make them ‘liked’; the sight 
of food may be irresistibly attractive to the starving 
person, but if out of reach it may torment rather than 
please. But the food is still much ‘wanted’. In sum- 
mary, incentive motivation is proposed to involve three 
distinct psychological processes acting together; piea- 
sure, associative learning and incentiue salience and 
different neural systems are thought to be responsible 
for each27*28v* 
* *. 
Changes in any one of these three processes that 
* Note, however, that in discussing his anhedania h~thesis 
of do~ami~e blockade Wise361 stated: “The anhedonia hypothesis is most 
vulnerable in its assumption that positive hedonic states such as pleasure or euphoria are attenuated by neuroleptics. This is, for the most 
part, speculation” (p. 184). 
* * Although neither Bindra nor Toates distinguished ‘wanting’ from ‘liking’, Toates 33p did distinguish the associative control of ‘wanti~g/I~k- 
ing’ from mere recall of past ‘wanti~/ii~n8’. 
For example, as in the Krieckhaus effect, a stimulus that is ordinarily not ‘wanted’ or ‘liked’ 
may suddenly become ‘wanted/liked’ 
on the basis of its prior associations when physiological state is changed”@.

constitute 
incentive motivation would produce effects 
on instrumental 
or appetitive 
behavior indistinguish- 
able, by most measures, 
from changes 
in another. 
Mesotelencephalic 
dopamine does not seem to be criti- 
cal specifically for associative learning; i.e., for forming 
stimulus-stimulus 
associations’“-““. 
For 
example, 
dopamine 
antagonists do not disrupt the learning of 
associations between a stimulus and electrical shock, as 
measured by a conditioned 
emotional response or by 
the defensive buying paradigm2z,z3,141. It is more likely, 
therefore, 
that the effects of dopamine on motivated 
behavior are due to effects on subjective pleasure or 
incentive salience, If mesotelencephaIic 
dopamine sys- 
tems mediate 
the subjective 
pleasurable 
effects 
of 
drugs, then the addictive property 
of drugs such as 
cocaine, 
heroin, 
amphetamine, 
etc., which sensitize 
dopamine systems, might be best understood 
in terms 
of the pleasure these drugs induce. But if a sensitized 
dopamine 
system enhanced 
the incentive salience of 
the act of taking drugs, rather 
than the subjective 
pleasurable effects of drugs, then the neuroadaptations 
underlying 
sensitization 
would 
cause 
drugs 
to be 
‘wanted’ or craved, independently 
of the pIeasure they 
produce. 
Most animal studies on the effects of dopamine 
antagonists on motivated behavior (summarized in Note 
2 in Ch. 6) are equally consistent with the hypothesis 
that dopamine mediates pleasure (the anhedonia 
hy- 
pothesis of Wise) and the hypothesis that dopamine 
mediates incentive saIience”**s. Likewise, studies on 
the effects of manipulating 
dopamine systems on the 
incentive properties of conditioned reinforcers are con- 
sistent 
with 
both 
interpretations 
of 
dopamine 
functions5*262. In these latter experiments animals must 
learn a new instrumental 
response (bar press) that is 
reinforced 
only by a stimulus (light/tone) 
that was 
previously associated with a primary incentive, such as 
food, water or a mate. Manipulations 
that increase 
dopamine 
neurotransmission 
in the ventral striatum 
potentiate the incentive properties of conditioned rein- 
forcers 
and manipulations 
that decrease 
dopamine 
neurotransmission 
in the ventral striatum block these 
potentiating 
effects J4.127.168.169,264.333,334. 
Barry Everitt 
has suggested these studies support a view that, in 
some way “ventral striatal dopamine makes the world 
brighter” 
(Catecholamine 
Symposium, 
Amsterdam, 
1992). This view is compatible with the attribution 
of 
incentive salience h~othesis 
proposed here. Neverthe- 
less, these studies could also be interpreted 
in support 
of the ‘pleasure’ hypothesis and therefore, 
they do not 
resolve the issue. 
4.62. ~ntrus~ction into ‘wanting’ and ‘liking’. At first 
glance it seems it should be relatively easy to resolve 
the issue by asking people 
to report 
what effect 
dopamine antagonist drugs have on the subjective ef- 
fects of addictive drugs. Indeed, Wise”“’ challenged 
researchers 
to test this hypothesis, 
arguing that “it 
would be procedurally 
simple for workers using neu- 
roleptics with human subjects to determine the effects 
of these drugs on the subjective effect of rewarding 
stimuli”. Despite 
his challenge, 
the relationship 
he- 
tween 
dopamine 
blockade 
and anhedonia 
remains 
equivocal and the data are inconsistent~~.~9~. 
in light of the incentive salience hypothesis, 
how- 
ever, assessment of the effects of dopamine blockade 
on subjective pleasure in humans may not be as simple 
as Wise thought. In fact, it may be an especially diffi- 
cult task228. Humans may not, under normal condi- 
tions, be able to subjectively tell the difference 
be- 
tween the two psychological 
processes 
of ‘wanting’ 
versus ‘liking’. Studies of introspection 
and self-report 
have established that humans often (a) report psycho- 
logical ‘events’ that can be shown to have not hap- 
pened; (b) strongly deny the existence of psychological 
events that can be shown to have influenced 
their 
behavior; 
and (cl confuse 
events that are not con- 
nected22x. Under many circumstances 
humans actually 
have very little direct access into the nature of their 
own psychological processes. Rather, introspection 
ap- 
pears to interpret 
underlying 
processes in ways that 
seem plausible to the person22x. Introspection 
does not 
reveal psychological 
processes 
directly. 
This implies 
that a person might mistake a change in incentive 
salience for a change in pleasure (‘If I don’t want it, 
then I must not like it’). It may be possible to distin- 
guish between 
changes in ‘wanting’ and ‘liking’ by 
asking appropriate 
questions 
that tap into different 
aspects of a person’s reaction to an incentive, but this 
will have to be approached 
with great sophistication 
and caution. 
4.6.3. Euidence that ~esotele~~e~~a~~~ d~pa~i~e medi- 
ates incentive salience, not pleasure. Although the stud- 
ies cited above are equivocal, there are at least four 
lines of evidence which lead us to suggest that sensiti- 
zation of dopamine 
neurotransmission 
produces 
en- 
hanced incentive salience rather than enhanced plea- 
sure. The evidence is based both on reports by human 
addicts of their own experience 
and on studies in 
animals on the role of dopamine 
in sensory pleasure 
and motivated behavior. 
- The first line of evidence comes from animal studies 
that have explicitly examined the role of dopamine in 
mediating natural reactions to the sensory qualities of 
tastes. These studies have used the ‘taste reactivity 
paradigm’, which is based upon natural hedonic and 
aversive reactions (tongue protrusions, gapes, forelimb

Fig. 2. A schematic illustration of a major existing model of the psychological processes that constitute incentive motivation (A, top) and our 
alternative model, which proposes a separate process of incentive salience and accounts for the consequences of drug-induced sensitization (B, 
bottom). Panel A: the ‘Toates/Bindra 
model’ of incentive motivation, on which our model is based (adapted from Toates33g). By this model the 
sensory stimuli (CS and UCS) of incentive objects are both pleasant and attractive. Their ability to produce an incentive motivational state (Ki) is 
partly dependent on memories of previous favorable experiences with them. Ph~iological states (such as hunger, thirst or ~thdrawal) 
selectively 
potentiate the ability of particular stimuli (related to food, water or drugs) to evoke incentive processes: to become ‘wanted’ and ‘liked’ (see 
Toates339 for a more complete description of this model). Panel B: in our modified model of incentive motivation the psychological process (and 
neural substrate) for pleasure (‘liking’) is separate from the psychological process (and neural substrate) responsible for incentive salience 
(‘wanting’). We further propose that the activation of mesotelencephalic 
dopamine systems plays a direct role only in the process of ‘wanting’, via 
the attribution of incentive salience to the perception and representation 
of conditioned stimuli (as described by k-ridge 
and Valenstein*‘; also 
see Note 4 in Ch. 6). In Panel B the portion of the model (i.e., the psychological process) that is sensitized by repeated drug administration is 
‘highlighter 
within the shaded box, It is the h~mctivat~on 
of this specific psycholo~cal process (incentive salience), due to sensit~ation of its 
neural substrate by drugs, that results in the excessive attribution of incentive salience to drug-related stimuli. Whereas normal levels of incentive 
salience attribution results in normal ‘wanting’, we propose hyperactivation of this system results in excessive incentive salience attribution, which 
is experienced as craving. Craving is pathologically intense ‘wanting’. The major difference between our model of incentive motivation and the 
traditional model is that in ours the psychological processes and neural substrates responsible for pleasure (‘liking’) are separate from those for 
incentive salience (‘wanting’). Thus, in our model ‘natural incentives’ (UCS stimuli) produce pleasure directly, but produce incentive salience and 
elicit goal-directed 
approach behavior only indirectly (as indicated by the dashed arrow from ‘pleasure integrator’ to the ‘incentive salience 
attributer’). The direction of incentive salience at~ibution to stimuli that preceded or ac~mpanied 
incentive sahence activation is determined by 
associative learning. Thus, activation of the incentive salience attributor by a UCS results in incentive salience being assigned to the perception of 
conditioned 
stimuli that were originally neutral (such as the sight of a syringe) and to their mental representations. 
This is what makes 
conditioned 
stimuli attractive and ‘wanted’ and able to elicit approach. Conditioned 
stimuli (and UCS’s) are always compared against past 
associative memories. Without the direction provided by associative learning, incentive salience could not be focussed upon any single target. 
Although diffise attribution of incentive salience would be both psychologically and behaviorally activating, without associative direction it would 
not be sufficient to guide behavior towards a specific goal. Familiar conditioned stimuli that have been paired with incentive salience attribution 
in the past are the target of incentive salience when encountered again, especially when an animal is in pa~icular ph~iologjcal states (indicated 
by the arrow from ‘physiological drive cues’). Incentive salience assigned to conditioned stimuli must be further ‘rebonsted’ each time they are 
paired again with salience activation (indicated by the dashed arrow from the incentive salience attributor to associative learning). Disruption of 
this reboosting, by neurolepti~ 
for example, can produce ‘extinction mimicry’ or decay of incentive value. Ordin~ly, 
incentive salience is 
assigned only to stimuli that have been paired with pleasure. But brain manipulations 
(such as drugs or electrical brain stimulation) may 
circumvent pleasure, by activating the neural substrate of incentive salience directly. This will result in the attribution of incentive salience to 
associated stimuli and actions and result in their becoming ‘wanted’, even in the absence of pleasure. This can be considered a kind of ‘sham 
reward’ (see glossary entry for reward). Sensitization of the neural substrate for incentive salience will iead to pathological ‘wanting’ (craving) for 
stimuli associated with its excessive activation (e.g., those involved in drug taking), even if this produces little or no pleasure, As mentioned 
above, the direction of incentive salience by associative learning is the primary determinant of exactly which stimuli become craved. Thus, in the 
addict, drug-paired stimuli, which have been experienced repeatedly in association with the excessive stimulation of dopamine systems, become 
the nearly exclusive targets for the attribution of incentive salience. Other contributions of associative learning are also possible in this model. 
For example, the Pleasure elicited by a UCS can change with repeated experience, as when one develops an appreciative palate for Scotch 
whiskey (this is indicated in the model by the arrow from learning to the ‘pleasure integrator’). Also, a CS that has been repeatedly paired with 
Pleasure can come to itself elicit subjective pleasure, as in the example of a conditioned ‘high’ reported by ‘needle freaks’ (arrows from the CS to 
the ‘PleaRue integrator’ via associative learning). But we suggest these effects are separate from the attribution of incentive salience and that 
they have only a relatively weak influence on motivated behavior, compared to the craving produced by the attribution of excessive incentive 
salience. Finally, we suggest that none of the psychological processes described in this model, except for subjective ‘wanting’ (craving) and 
subjective pleasure, are apparent to conscious awareness. The interaction among incentive salience, pleasure and associative learning is not 
available to introspection. Only the final products of the interaction are interpreted by cognitive mechanisms (not shown in the figure, see Nisbett 
and Wilson22R) as subjective ‘wanting’ and ‘liking’. For an addict, whose neural substrates of incentive salience have been sensitized, the 
subjective product is dominated by the intense experience of drug craving.

flails, etc.1 that rats emit to tastes”“. 
Much like the 
facial expressions that human infants display to sweet 
or bitter tastes3’Y, these hedonic and aversive reactions 
reflect the perceived pleasure or displeasure of a taste 
sensation. The reactions of rats to taste are altered by 
many of the same things that control human percep- 
tions of taste pleasure. The sensory pleasure of sweet- 
ness to humans, for example, is enhanced by hunger 
and suppressed 
by caloric satiety4’“2. Hedonic 
reac- 
tions of rats to sweet tastes are similarly enhanced by 
hunger and suppressed by satiety26*43. The taste plea- 
sure of a palatable food for humans can be abolished 
and replaced 
with subjective aversion by associative 
pairing of that food with gastrointestinal 
illness278. 
Similarly, hedonic reactions 
of rats to sweetness are 
abolished and replaced by aversive behavioral reactions 
after associative pairing of that taste with illness”*. 
Finally, drugs that affect opioid or CABA neurotrans- 
mitters can enhance or suppress the hedonic reactions 
of rats to tastes in ways that should be expected based 
on current theories of the role of these neurotransmit- 
ter systems in taste pleasure75,uo%340. 
Application of the ‘taste reactivity paradigm’ to the 
roIe of mesotelencephal~c 
dopamine 
systems in taste 
pleasure and motivated behavior leads to the conclu- 
sion that dopamine systems do not mediate taste plea- 
sure, although they do mediate the incentive motiva- 
tional properties 
of foods. There 
are three lines of 
evidence leading to this conclusion. (1) Dopamine an- 
tagonists do not decrease the sensory pleasure of tastes, 
measured by hedonic reactions, although they can de- 
crease their incentive value. Conversely, dopam~ne ag- 
onists do not increase the sensory pleasure of tastes, 
although they can increase their incentive values4’. (21 
A bilateral 
neurotoxic 
lesion (&OHDA), 
which de- 
pletes dopamine from the nucleus accumbens and cau- 
date nucleus, does not diminish the hedonic evaluation 
of tastes, even though it completely aboiishes the moti- 
vation to eat and renders natural incentives ineffective’ 
(ref. 28 and unpublished 
data). (3) Activation of the 
motivation to eat by electrical stimulation of the fateral 
hypothalamus, which is mediated in part by dopamine 
systems, does not potentiate 
the hedonic evaluation of 
tastes*‘. 
These experiments 
suggest, therefore, 
that the role 
of dopamine systems in behavior motivated by food is 
not to enhance the sensory pleasure of tastes. Or, put 
another 
way, these experiments 
suggest that neural 
systems mediating 
‘wanting’ food can be dissociated 
from neural systems mediating ‘liking’ food and that 
dopamine 
activates ‘wanting’. This is what would be 
expected if dopamine mediates the salience of incen- 
tive stimuli, rather than the sensory pleasure evoked by 
incentive stimuli (Fig. 2). These findings are precisely 
what would be expected on the basis of our hypothesis 
that dopamine systems mediate the incentive motiva- 
tional effects of drugs and are dissociable from other 
neural systems that mediate the subjective pleasurable 
effects of drugs and other stimuli. This kind of dissoci- 
ation would explain the findings reported by Fischman 
and Fohin’” and by Lamb et al.‘“* (see above). You 
will recall that in these studies a low dose injection of 
cocaine or morphine motivated drug-taking behavior in 
‘postaddicts’, but did not produce self-reported 
subjec- 
tive pleasure. 
- The second line of evidence that dopamine mediates 
incentive salience rather than sensory pleasure comes 
from a series of electrophysiological 
experiments 
on 
the conditions 
under which dopamine 
neurons 
dis- 
charge in behaving animals2s8. When monkeys are first 
exposed to a novel situation dopamine 
neurons dis- 
charge to new, unexpected stimuli that produce orient- 
ing behavior. But these neuronal 
and behavioral 
re- 
sponses soon habituate 199 Dopamine neurons also re- 
. 
spond when an animal encounters 
a natural incentive, 
such as when it touches food located out-of-sight or, in 
a learning 
task, when 
liquid in delivered 
to the 
mouth’99,287. However, when a neutral stimulus (e.g., 
light) is paired with the availability of a natural incen- 
tive, dopamine 
neurons soon stop responding 
to the 
natural incentive and start to discharge most vigorously 
in response to the newly established conditioned incen- 
the sti~uZus~‘~ (also see ref. 217). Dopamine neurons 
do not discharge when the animal actually eats the 
food, which they should if dopamine 
mediated 
the 
sensory pleasure associated with incentives (ref. 330 as 
well). Similarly, Kosobud et a1.‘8” reported in a recent 
poster that in rats trained to bar press for sucrose, 
VTA unit activity increased prior to the presentation 
of sucrose. Dopamine neurons did not increase activity 
after sucrose presentation, 
when presumably 
the ani- 
mal would experience 
sensory pleasure. 
Finally, the 
activity of dopamine neurons can be dissociated from 
non-incentive 
aspects of a situation and from the de- 
tails of motor behavior, because their discharge is not 
coupled to “mnemonic or preparatory 
representational 
task components” 
(ref. 198, p. 3371, to the execution of 
reaching movements to obtain and retrieve food or to a 
light unassociated 
with food’99,287,289. Studies in cats 
also suggest that VTA dopamine neurons do not dis- 
charge in relation to most phasic movements330’“4t. 
In summary, 
dopamine 
neurons 
discharge 
under 
conditions consistent with an attribution 
of incentive 
salience 
hypothesis 
of dopamine 
function27r28. They 
change their rate of discharge to a stimulus as the 
incentive value of the stimulus changes; as the stimulus

becomes more or less salient. Indeed, Schultz288 con- 
cluded that their electrophysiological 
experiments “are 
consistent with the conclusion that dopamine neurons 
respond specifically to salient stimuli that have alert- 
ing, arousing and attention-grabbing 
properties” 
(p. 
134, our italics) #. 
- A third line of evidence that dopamine 
mediates 
incentive salience rather than sensory pleasure comes 
from recent studies using high speed chronamperome- 
try to measure nucleus accumbens dopamine 
activity 
during i.v. self-administration 
of heroin or cocaine”5Y’72. 
In trained animals the first few drug injections greatly 
elevated 
a dopamine-related 
electrochemical 
signal. 
However, 
detailed 
analysis of the time course 
of 
changes in the dopamine-related 
electrochemical 
sig- 
nal, relative to subsequent injections, revealed that the 
dopamine-related 
signal increased prior to drug self- 
administration, 
peaked 
at the time a response 
was 
inititated and then significantly decreased immediately 
following drug infusion. This is consistent with the view 
that dopamine 
mediates 
the incentive 
salience 
at- 
tributed to a drug-associated 
stimulus (presumably the 
lever in this case), because as extracellular 
dopamine 
increased drug ‘wanting’ would increase, to the point 
that an animal would initiate another drug infusion. 
The results are not consistent, however, with the view 
that dopamine mediates subjective pleasure (in which 
case dopamine should rise after drug administration). 
Neither 
are they consistent with the view that drug 
responding is initiated by withdrawal symptoms associ- 
ated with dopamine depletion, as suggested, for exam- 
ple, by Dackis and Golda. 
A dopamine 
depletion 
hypothesis would predict that animals should initiate a 
drug infusion when the dopamine signal is at its lowest, 
not 
highest. 
Of 
course, 
a dopamine 
depletion/ 
withdrawal hypothesis, such as that proposed by Da&is 
and Gold”, 
also suffers from the shortcomings associ- 
ated with all negative 
reinforcement 
hypotheses 
of 
addiction, which were discussed above. 
- The fourth line of evidence that dopamine is more 
likely to produce 
enhanced 
incentive 
salience than 
enhanced drug pleasure comes from a consideration 
of 
the relative patterns 
of change in drug ‘wanting’ vs. 
drug ‘liking’ reported 
by human addicts during the 
gradual development 
of addictive behavior 
(Fig. 3). 
The pleasure induced by drugs does not increase if the 
dose of a drug is held constant 
over the course of 
repeated 
administrations. 
In fact, if pleasure changes

Fig. 3. A schematic illustration 
of the hypothetical 
relationship 
between changes in the incentive value of drugs and drug-related 
stimuli (drug ‘wanting’) vs. the subjective pleasurable effects of drugs 
(drug ‘liking’) during the development of an addiction. The develop- 
ment of an addiction is characterized 
by an increasing dissociation 
between the incentive properties of drugs, which gradually increase 
and the subjective pleasurable effects of drugs, which are shown here 
to slightly decrease (develop tolerance; but also see text and Note 5 
in Ch. 6). 
at all it decreases with repeated 
administrations 
(al- 
though, see Note 5 in Ch. 6). If increased 
synaptic 
activity in sensitized dopamine systems were the neural 
substrate 
of pleasure, 
a given dose should produce 
more and more pleasure 
with repeated 
experience, 
rather than less and less (or no change). 
Although the pleasure produced by a drug does not 
increase for human addicts, the craving for the same 
drug does increase with repeated 
experience 
(Fig. 3). 
An increase in ‘wanting’ drugs, as evidenced by self-re- 
port and by progressively more compulsive drug-seek- 
ing and drug-taking behavior is, of course, the defining 
characteristic 
of drug addiction. An increase in drug 
craving without an increase in drug pleasure cannot by 
explained 
on the assumption 
that sensitization 
en- 
hances a dopaminergic mechanism mediating the sub- 
jective pleasure of drugs (see Note 3 in Ch. 6). But this 
increasing dissociation between drug ‘wanting’ and drug 
‘liking’ is precisely what would be expected if enhanced 
activity at dopamine 
synapses were the neural sub- 
strate responsible for incentive salience (see Note 4 in 
Ch. 6). 
5. ELABORATION 
OF THE 
INCENTIVE-SENSITIZA- 
TION THEORY 
AND ITS IMPLICATIONS 
In this section we will elaborate more precisely how 
the major features of addiction are explained by the 
Incentive-Sensitization 
Theory of Addiction 
and dis- 
cuss implications 
of the theory. 
To summarize 
the 
I Schultz”0 tentatively suggested that the common psychological process underlying the discharge of dopamine neurons may be “motivational 
arousal”, but also noted this was not completely satisfactory because “dopamine neurons respond every few seconds to the same stimuli over 
several tens of trials without habituation’997275~27*ss9, 
whereas arousal should be a longer lasting state not repeatedly induced at such short 
intervals” (p. 135). We suggest that the conditions under which dopamine neurons discharge are better described by the hypothesis that 
dopamine neurons attribute incentive salience27s28.

central elements of the theory, we posit the following. 
( 1) Many addictive drugs have in common the ability to 
enhance 
mesotelencephalic 
dopamine 
neurotransmis- 
sion and to engage related structures (but see Note 4 in 
Ch. 61. (21 A psychological 
function 
of this neural 
system is to attribute incentive salience to the percep- 
tion and mental representation 
of stimuli and actions, 
especially those that have been associated with activa- 
tion of the system; to cause them to become highly 
salient, attractive and ‘wanted’. (3) Repeated 
and in- 
termittent 
administration 
of addictive drugs leads to 
incremental 
neuroadaptations 
in this neural system, 
which render it increasingly and perhaps permanently 
hyperresponsive 
(sensitized). (4) Associative control of 
this sensitized neural system causes tremendously 
en- 
hanced incentive salience to be attributed to the act of 
drug taking and to stimuli associated with drug taking 
(i.e., to the acts and stimuli most closely associated 
with hyperactivation 
of dopamine systems); and thus, 
in the addict, drugs come to be pathologically ‘wanted’ 
(craved). (5) Sensitization of the neural system respon- 
sible for incentive salience can motivate addictive be- 
havior (compulsive drug seeking and drug taking) inde- 
pendent of other motivating factors, such as the expec- 
tation of drug pleasure or the aversive properties 
of 
withdrawal. The associative targeting of sensitized in- 
centive salience to drug-related 
stimuli results in the 
persistence 
of addictive behavior even in the face of 
many disincentives: for example, the loss of reputation, 
job, home and family (see Note 6 in Ch. 61. 
We have argued that addictive behavior is motivated 
by the excessive ‘wanting’ of drugs (drug craving). 
Therefore, 
the first major issue we need to address is: 
why do addicts crave drugs independently 
of drug 
pleasure and withdrawal? What is the neuropsychologi- 
cal process that results in obsessive craving for drugs, 
leading to compulsive 
drug-seeking 
and drug-taking 
behavior, even when the drug may produce little plea- 
sure? The second fundamental 
question we need to 
address concerns why drug craving persists for so long 
after the discontinuation 
of drug use and after the 
cessation of withdrawal symptoms; i.e., the nature of 
relapse. After this we will discuss the implications of 
Incentive-Sensitization 
for indi~dual differences in the 
propensity to addiction, for therapy and the relation- 
ship between Incentive-Sensitization 
and other views 
of addiction. 
5.1. The independence of drug craving from drag plea- 
sure and wif~ra~al 
The 
Incentive-Sensitization 
Theory 
of Addiction 
provides an unique neuropsychological 
explanation for 
drug craving. Drug craving is the subjective experience 
that accompanies the attribution 
of excessive levels of 
incentive salience to drug-related stimuli (or their men- 
tal representations), 
due to sensitization of dopamine 
systems (see Note 4 in Ch. 6). Thus, drug craving is 
considered 
by this hypothesis 
to be a psychological 
process that is distinct from conditioned 
withdrawal 
signs and from either drug-induced 
pleasure or a con- 
ditioned ‘high’. Other views of addiction often consider 
craving to be identical with or the direct result of, 
either conditioned 
withdrawal or a conditioned 
‘high’, 
For example, Childress et al.“’ state: “We have often 
used the terms ‘conditioned 
withdrawal’ and ‘condi- 
tioned craving’ almost interchangeably, 
with the as- 
sumption that craving might be a form of mild with- 
drawal” (p. 38). But Childress et al.5o go on to say: 
“Our patients did not, however, always subscribe to 
this position; reports of craving usually showed low 
correlations with reports of withdrawal. To paraphrase 
one indignant user, ‘No, dot, craving is when you want 
it - want it so bad you can almost taste it... but you 
ain’t sick... sick is, well, sick’ “. To this addict with- 
drawal 
sickness 
clearly 
is separable 
from 
drug 
craving2r2. Neither 
is craving equivalent 
to a condi- 
tioned ‘high’, because reports of conditioned 
‘highs’ 
are uncommon and are thus dissociable from the more 
frequent 
occurrence 
of both conditioned 
withdrawal 
signs and conditioned craving, as discussed earlier”0,22Y. 
The Incentive-Sensitization 
view of addiction is in 
agreement with the indignant user cited above; craving 
is pathological ‘wanting’. It is not due to sickness. It is 
distinct from both the unpleasant 
symptoms of with- 
drawal and from drug pleasure. This view is supported 
by studies directly relating self-reported 
craving in- 
duced by exposure to drug-associated 
stimuli to ratings 
of withdrawal-like 
symptoms, 
drug-like 
effects 
and 
‘outcome 
expectancies’80,25”. Although 
exposure 
to 
drug-related 
stimuli produced a significant increase in 
self-reported 
craving, as well as drug-opposite 
and 
drug-like effects “in a simple additive model the com- 
bined effects of positive outcome 
expectancies, 
cue- 
specific dysphoria and cue-specific drug-positive reac- 
tions were able to predict 
28% of the variance 
in 
cue-specific craving.“... “A much larger proportion 
of 
the variance in craving remains unexplained 
by these 
factors” (ref. 253, p. 1142-1143). We suggest the rea- 
son there is only a weak relationship 
between these 
variables and drug craving is that they do not cause 
crauing. 
Craving is due to excessive activity in a sepa- 
rate and sensitized neuronal system that mediates the 
attribution of salience to incentives. This is a neuronal 
system that normally mediates the ‘wanting’ of things 
in the environment. 
Although 
this neuronal 
system 
usually functions in concert with neuronal systems that 


----- Page 21 (native text) -----
mediate 
pleasure 
(‘liking’), in the addict the normal 
link between these systems is disrupted and pathologi- 
cal levels of ‘wanting’ become dissociated from ‘liking’. 
We think this dissociation 
accounts for the unusual 
psychological profile of an addict: intense drug craving 
separated from the normal pleasures and punishments 
of life *. 
In this light the irrationality 
of addictive behavior, 
which is discussed so eloquently by Falk et al.%, starts 
to make some ‘sense’. The irrationali~ 
of the behavior 
is due to an increasing dissociation between the incen- 
tive properties 
of drugs (incentive salience) and their 
subjective pleasurable 
effects. Because the process of 
salience attribution 
can be activated, independent 
of 
subjective pleasure, 
incentive salience can be strong 
even if pleasure is weak or absent. This is one reason 
why there is not always a strong correlation 
between 
the incentive motivational properties of drugs and their 
hedonic properties. 
It is also why people will self-ad- 
minister low doses of drugs that do not produce subjec- 
tive pleasure 95~192 Furthermore, 
the attribution 
of in- 
. 
centive salience is not a conscious process and the 
introspective 
experience of ‘wanting’ or craving is only 
a person’s interpretation 
of the outcome of that pro- 
cess. Much of the time the attribution 
of incentive 
salience may be more implicit than explicit***. Regard- 
less, the addict can be only subjectively aware of the 
outcome 
of excessive incentive 
salience 
attribution, 
craving. The addict may have little insight into the 
reason for the craving and indeed, may himself be 
bewildered by its intensity. At a ~nscious 
level addicts 
may recount all of the negative consequences 
of con- 
tinued drug use, deplore their situation, even comment 
that the drug does not continue to give great pleasure 
- and not understand 
why their craving persists. 
267 
5.2. The ~ue~~~nt 
of addictive behavior 
The Incentive-Sensitization 
Theory can explain why 
the development 
of an addiction is typically a gradual, 
progressive process. The attribution 
of a high level of 
incentive salience to drug-associated 
stimuli and the 
pleasurable 
effects of drugs, increase the probability 
drug-related stimuli will attract attention and that drugs 
will be sought out in the future. If drug use continues, 
dopamine 
systems become progressively 
more sensi- 
tized. With each repetition 
greater and greater incen- 
tive salience is attributed 
to drug-related 
stimuli and 
the associative pairing of drug-related 
stimuli with the 
intense activation of dopamine 
systems produced 
by 
drugs leads to an increasing focus of salience attribu- 
tion upon just these stimuli. Thus, ‘wanting’ is gradu- 
ally transformed 
into craving, drugs become craved to 
the relative exclusion of all else, and drug-associated 
stimuli elicit this craving independent 
of any pleasure 
they produce. In short, the developing addict comes to 
‘want’ drugs more 
and more because 
drug-related 
stimuli become imbued with greater and greater incen- 
tive salience, even though at the same time drugs may 
be ‘liked’ less and less. 
5.3. Relapse: drug-induced drug craving 
Drug craving sometimes 
remains high or is even 
increased immediately after drug administration, 
when 
the drug is producing subjective pleasure, as has been 
reported 
for alcohol, cocaine, heroin and hydromor- 
phone s@~~~150*2’5+325. 
This is the proverbial 
drink that 
whets the appetite 
and leads to relapse. Why should 
this be? As pointed out earlier, this is not consistent 
with a negative reinforcement 
view of craving329, be- 
cause the drug should eliminate 
withdrawal 
symp- 
toms **. Neither is it consistent with a pleasure-seek- 
* Other brain manipulations also are known to ‘fracture’ behavioral or psychological subsystems whose operations are so intertwined that one’s 
subjective experience is of only one process. An example is the phenomenon of ‘blindsight’350, which refers to the ability of people rendered 
blind by an occipital cortex lesion to accurately localize visual stimuli presented 
in their blind visual field, despite having no conscious 
awareness of perceiving any stimulus. People have no subjective experience of separate psychological processes (and neural systems) 
underlying the identification vs. the localization of visual stimuli. But an occipital lesion ‘fractures’ these processes, revealing two distinct 
psychological processes where there appeared to be only one. Another example is the dissociation of declarative (explicit) and procedural 
(implicit) memory systems seen following damage to the medial temporal lobes3t8 . We are not subjectively aware that distinct neural systems 
are involved in learning to solve puzzles (for example, the Tower of Hanoi puzzle) and learning facts (for example, learning a list of words). 
But following a bilateral medial temporal lobe lesion the ability to learn and remember facts is lost, whereas the ability to learn and 
remember puzzles is left intact; although the latter occurs in the absence of conscious awareness. We think that the dissociation between 
‘wanting’ and ‘liking’ seen in addicts represents a ‘fracture’ of psychological processes akin to ‘blindsight’ and the implicit/explicit 
memory 
distinction. That is, repeated drug use changes the brain, as a lesion changes the brain, revealing two distinct psychological processes where 
there subjectively appeared to be only one. Furthermore, 
like the localization of visual stimuli and procedural learning, the attribution of 
incentive salience is “implicit’; it often may occur in the absence of conscious awareness. 
* * Except according to Solomon’s opponent-process 
theory3t2, which is the only negative reinforcement 
theory that can successfully explain 
relapse induced by re-exposure to the drug. According to Solomon’s theory, re-exposure to the drug elicits a moderate a-process or drug-like 
effect, which in turn triggers the still strong b-process or drug-opponent effect. The problems faced by the opponent-process 
theory, however 
are: (1) it relies entirely upon withdrawal symptoms to motivate addictive behavior and is thus liable to the general criticisms that we 
described for negative reinforcement 
theories of addiction; (2) it posits the growth of an opponent-like 
process during addiction, for which 
there is no direct evidence other than the phenomena 
of tolerance and withdrawal themselves (and which is contradicted 
by evidence 
discussed above that the incentive properties of drugs show sensitization rather than tolerance); and (3) it posits the ~~nent-press 
to be 
elicited only and always by the a-process, whereas evidence exists that withdrawal and drug pleasure have separate, independent 
neural 
substrates3@.

268 
ing view? because a dose sufficient to produce subjec- 
tive pleasure 
should satisfy or at least reduce 
the 
craving; not exacerbate it. Drug craving at the time of 
drug taking is consistent, however, with an Incentive- 
Sensitization 
view. According 
to Incentive-Sensitiza- 
tion craving is the subjective experience associated with 
incentive salience attribution, 
Because many addictive 
drugs increase dopamine 
activity, which produces in- 
centive salience, one would expect drug administration 
to produce drug ‘wanting’, 
Indeed, there is considerable 
evidence that re-ex- 
posure to drugs can reinstate compulsive drug-seeking 
and drug-taking behaviors3,325,326. As pointed 
out by 
Stewart et al.326: “ The idea that ingestion of a formerly 
abused drug induces a strong motivational 
state or 
craving for the drug and that it retains the ability to 
reinstate this craving over an indefinite period of absti- 
nence from the drug is not new. One of the basic 
tenets of Alcoholics Anonymous (anonymous, 
1939) is 
that people who have at one time shown uncontrolled 
drinking and physical dependence 
are permanently un- 
able to drink moderately; one drink is said to elicit an 
urge to have another” 
(p. 25’7). This phenomenon 
is 
usually explained 
by ‘priming’ and Stewart et al.326 
have argued that ‘priming’ reinstates drug use because 
“the presence of the drug in the body (not its absence) 
activates appetitive motivational 
mechanisms that are 
involved in the reinitiation 
of drug seeking behavior” 
(p, 253). An involvement 
of dopamine 
in priming is 
suggested by reports 
that the infusion of morphine 
directly into the ventral tegmental area is sufficient to 
prime responding for i.v. heroin or cocaine, intra-accu- 
mbens amphetamine 
can prime 
responding 
for i.v. 
heroin325j32h, and haloperidol 
prevents 
priming 
for 
amphetamine 
. 
83 It is also relevant to note that craving 
in long-term abstinent cocaine abusers (humans) has 
been associated with elevated plasma and CSF levels of 
the dopamine metabolite, HVA173*20h. 
Stewart’s view is entirely consistent with the Incen- 
tive-sensitization 
Theory of Addiction presented here. 
We would add only two additional 
points. First, an 
Incentive-Sensitization 
view of addiction identi~es the 
“appetitive 
motivational 
mechanism” 
mentioned 
by 
Stewart et a1.326 specifically as incentive salience and 
not, for example, drug pleasure. Second, we hypothe- 
size that the ability of drugs to produce 
incentive 
salience is progressively increased (sensitized) by re- 
peated 
exposure 
to drugs because 
drugs sensitize 
mesotelencephalic 
dopamine 
systems. Thus, in highly 
sensitized individuals, such as addicts, relapse is the 
rule rather than the exception, especially after a prim- 
ing ‘taste’, because this acts on a hypersensitive neural 
system that mediates 
incentive 
salience 
- eliciting 
pathologically 
strong ‘wanting’ (craving) and thus re- 
lapse. 
5.4. Relapse: interactions between different drags and the 
effects of drag-related stimuli 
Not only can the preferred 
drug af abuse reinstate 
addictive behavior, but often other drugs can as well; 
and addicts usually use more than one drug (which is 
significant in itself). In animals too, priming can occur 
across drug classes. For example, i.v. amphetamine 
or 
bromocriptine 
can prime the self-administration 
of 
heroin367 and i.v. morphine can prime responding in 
animals trained to self-administer 
cocaine3”. 
Further- 
more, dopamine systems have been implicated in prim- 
ing between drug classes. An intra-accumbens 
injection 
of 
amphetamine, 
which 
selectively 
activates 
the 
mesolimbic dopamine 
system, can prime responding 
for i.v. heroin327 and intra-ventral 
tegmental area mor- 
phine can prime responding for i.v. cocaine322. 
According to the Incentive-Sensitization 
view of ad- 
diction, drugs can prime responding 
for each other 
because the same dopamine systems are activated by 
each and dopamine 
mediates 
the incentive 
salience 
attributed 
to many 
different 
drugs, 
Therefore, 
if 
dopamine systems become sensitized by past drug use 
it would be expected that a second, novel drug would 
be able to prime responding and precipitate relapse, as 
long as the second drug also activates hypersensitive 
dopamine systems. This idea was proposed previously 
by Stewart and Vezina327, who argued that the ability 
of opiates and stimulants to prime responding for one 
another “may be related to the ability of opiates and 
stimulant drugs to cause sensitization” 
(p. 2871, within 
dopamine systems. In support of this view, cross-sensi- 
tization has been reported 
to the psychomotor 
stimu- 
lant effects and to the incentive motivational effects of 
a number of drugs, as well as in the ability of drugs to 
elevate 
dopamine 
neurotransmission 
(see above for 
references). 
Not only may re-exposure 
to drugs themselves pre- 
cipitate relapse, but environmental 
stimuli associated 
with drugs are known to induce craving and precipitate 
relapse in humans50~zz9 and prime drug responding in 
animals325*“26. This evidence 
has been reviewed 
by 
Stewart et a1.326 and need not be reiterated 
here. It is 
consistent, 
however, 
with an Incentive-Sensitization 
view of addiction. In this view sensitization of a neural 
substrate 
responsible 
for incentive salience becomes 
expressed as addictive behavior largely by enhancing 
the incentive 
properties 
of stimuli associated 
with 
drugs. Heightened 
incentive 
salience is focussed on 
these stimuli and their mental representations 
by asso- 
ciative learning processes and they become the elicitors 


----- Page 23 (native text) -----
269 
and objects of craving. Even in the absence of the drug 
and long after withdrawal signs have faded, drug-re- 
lated stimuli remain potent conditioned 
incentives able 
to elicit the attribution of incentive salience. Indeed, in 
the context of an Incentive-Sensitization 
view of addic- 
tion this is why environmental 
stimuli associated with 
drugs are extremely effective in precipitating relapse in 
addicts (however, see Note 8). 
This view is an alternative 
to both the conditioned 
‘high’ interpretation 
and the ‘explicit memory’ inter- 
pretation of relapse discussed above in the section on 
positive reinforcement/euphoria 
theories. We suggest 
the effects of drug-related 
stimuli on relapse are inde- 
pendent of both drug cue elicited feelings of pleasure 
(a conditioned 
‘high’) and of the explicit memories of 
drug taking such cues might elicit. You will recall we 
argued that an ‘explicit memory’ hypothesis of relapse 
places an e~raordina~ 
explanato~ 
burden 
on the 
assumption that relapse-provoking 
memories are quali- 
tatively different 
from the myriad other memories of 
drugs that do not provoke relapse. We suggest, to the 
contrary, 
that conscious remembering 
in response to 
cues may be essentially similar to explicit memories 
that have gone before, neither more vivid nor qualita- 
tively different. 
The difference 
in the processes trig- 
gered by an effective drug-paired context, which results 
in relapse when earlier memories did not, may be in 
associative 
incentive 
systems that are not explicitly 
available to consciousness. 
Incentive salience is such an associatively triggered 
process. It occurs in the absence of awareness and its 
operation 
requires no qualitative difference 
in explic- 
itly conscious 
memory in order to provoke 
relapse. 
Unlike explicit memories, the attribution 
of incentive 
salience is an implicit process. It is governed by the 
laws of associative learning and is influenced by factors 
that control other 
forms of implicit learning. Chief 
among these controlling influences is the gating role of 
associative contextZ9. Context refers to the entire con- 
figuration of situational 
stimuli in which the CS has 
been learned. 
Associative 
context can modulate 
the 
effectiveness of any CS. Why then should relapse occur 
at a particular 
moment, 
rather 
than during earlier 
memories or earlier encounters with drug-paired stim- 
uli? Presumably because of variations in the complete- 
ness of the associative context. The greater the extent 
to which contextual factors, such as mood, environment 
and other situational variables, mimic the context of 
previous drug taking, the more likely relapse will occur. 
5.5. Relapse: the role of stress 
Relapse to compulsive drug use is not always precip- 
itated by re-exposure 
to a drug or even by specific 
environmental 
stimuli associated with drugs, but some- 
times by ill-defined environmental 
~ircumstan~s; 
in- 
cluding mood changes evoked by stress4p*229. A tradi- 
tional view of why stress may lead to relapse is that it 
prompts ‘escape’ from an unpleasant situation via drug 
taking. An alternative possibility is that sensitization of 
incentive salience could play a role in stress-induced 
relapse because addictive drugs and stress both acti- 
vate dopamine 
systems and both sensitize dopamine 
systemss.9J60,26s. A s iscussed above, animals previously 
d’ 
exposed to drugs such as amphetamine, 
cocaine or 
morphine are later hyperresponsive 
to stress and ani- 
mals exposed to repeated 
inte~ittent 
stress are later 
hyperresponsive 
to the psychomotor 
stimulant and in- 
centive motivational properties 
of drugs243. According 
to an Incentive-Sensitization 
view stress may induce 
craving and relapse because, by activating dopamine 
systems, stress would magnify the incentive salience 
attributed 
to environmental 
stimuli. Environmental 
stimuli that were especially potent as incentives, such 
as drug-associated 
stimuli for addicts, would be the 
focus of enhanced 
salience due to their associative 
history. Drug-associated 
events would become espe- 
cially craved again as a consequence of stress (see Note 
9 in Ch. 6). 
It is interesting 
to speculate that the converse se- 
quence of events could also occur. That is, prior expo- 
sure to repeated 
intermittent 
stress may predispose 
susceptible individuals to drug addiction by sensitizing 
those neural systems that mediate the incentive moti- 
vational effects of drugs6g~‘sg~268. 
In such individuals the 
incentive motivational effects of an initial drug experi- 
ence may be significantly enhanced 
because of drug 
action on a previously sensitized neural substrate. This 
would increase the probability 
that these individuals 
would show subsequent 
drug-seeking and drug-taking 
behavior. 
Indeed, 
experimental 
evidence for such a 
phenomenon 
has been reported by Piazza et al.243, who 
found that past experience 
with stress (repeated 
tail 
pinch) facilitated 
the subsequent 
acquisition 
of am- 
phetamine self-administration 
behavior in rats. 
5.6. Indiuidual differences in the propensity to addiction 
The last feature of addiction we will discuss con- 
cerns the fact that the majority of people 
in this 
country at some point experiment with drugs, but most 
do not become 
addicts. For example, over 55% of 
18-34 yr olds have at one time sampled illicit drugs 
(e.g., marijuana, 
inhalents, 
cocaine, heroin or hallu- 
cinogens; NIDA National Household 
Survey on Drug 
Abuse, 1991). Why do the vast majority of these people 
not develop an addiction? 
Why are some individuals 
more susceptible to addiction than others? Social fac- 


----- Page 24 (native text) -----
270 
tom are important, of course, but even persons from 
very similar backgrounds 
differ greatly in their ten- 
dency to develop addictive behavior. If, as proposed 
here, drug-induced neuroadaptations 
underlying sensi- 
tization 
play a central 
role in the development 
of 
addiction: (11 there should be large individual differ- 
ences in the susceptib~li~ to sensitization and (2) indi- 
vidual differences 
in the susceptibili~ 
to sensitization 
should be related to the propensity to addiction. 
There are indeed enormous individual differences in 
the susceptibility to sensitization, a point that has been 
emphasized 
by a number 
of researchers’gO~‘94*268,294. 
Some of this individual variation 
is due to genetic 
variation, 
because among animals there are marked 
strain differences 
in the susceptibility to sensitization. 
Strain differences 
in both rats and mice have been 
reported 
in the sensitization 
produced 
by repeated 
treatment 
with amphet~ine1’o~194~2~8~3~, cocaine304, 
ethano160~i42~240 and 
morphine302. 
There 
are 
also 
marked strain differences 
in mesotelencephalic 
dopa- 
mine systems14,9”145, but we know of no studies directly 
relating strain differences in the susceptibility to sensi- 
tization 
to strain 
differences 
in mesotelencephaIic 
dopamine 
systems. Nevertheless, 
it is important 
that 
initial studies with recombinent-inbred 
lines of mice 
suggest that the genetic determinants 
of acute respon- 
siveness to drugs are dissociable from those responsible 
for susceptibili~ 
to sensitization3@‘. Many behavioral 
genetic studies on drug responsiveness 
have focussed 
on variation in the acute response to drugs, not suscep- 
tibility to sensitization. But the Incentive-Sensitization 
Theory suggests that the susceptibility to sensitization 
may be most relevant for the development of addictive 
behavior and therefore, 
information on genetic factors 
leading to high susceptibility to sensitization may be of 
particular importance in understanding 
the genetics of 
addiction. 
A number of other factors have been reported 
to 
influence individual differences in the susceptibili~ 
to 
sensitization including, 
;1g63100,175,303, 
sex45,'6,107,250,"','73 
and hemispheric 
differences 
in dopamine 
systemslgO. 
Whether 
the influence of these variables on the sus- 
ceptibility 
to sensitization 
is causally related 
to the 
propensity to self-administer 
drugs or to related varia- 
tion in dopamine systems is not yet known, although 
correlative relations have been reported47’io8,109,294. 
There are, however, a number of interesting studies 
on behavioral traits that do predict both the suscepti- 
bility to sensitization and the propensity to self-admin- 
ister amphetamine~4~. For example, 
responsivity 
to 
novelty is reported to predict susceptibility to sensitiza- 
tion’33-‘3s~242. Similarly, animals that eat and drink in 
response 
to electrical 
stimulation 
of the lateral hy- 
pothalamus (not all do) show an enhanced susceptibil- 
ity to amphetamine 
sensitization2”.~“. 
Most impor- 
tantly, these same traits are correlated with a propen- 
sity to acquire amphetamine 
self-administration241 and 
with differences 
in dopamine dynamics in the nucleus 
accumbens”6~‘“2. Individual differences 
in reactivity to 
novelty, 
in amphetamine 
sensitization, 
and in am- 
phetamine self-administration 
may involve variation in 
the responsiveness 
of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adre- 
nal (HPA) axis. Animals that show a high response to 
novelty also show a prolonged 
elevation 
in plasma 
corticosterone 
in this situation, 
relative 
to low re- 
sponders~9u*z4*. That the HPA axis may play a role in 
drug sensitization is suggested by experiments showing 
that activation of the HPA axis is necessary to induce 
sensitization 
to amphetamine 
or stress54,553h9, perhaps 
by the action of corticosterone 
on glucocorticoid recep- 
tors”’ 
(cf. ref. 57) and by a report 
that repeated 
exposure 
to exogenous 
corticosterone 
sensitizes ani- 
mals to a subsequent amphetamine 
challenge244. 
5.7. Irnpfications of the Incentirie-Sensitization 
Theory 
for Therupy 
There is considerable 
interest in developing effec- 
tive therapies for the treatment 
of drug addiction, but 
this has proven to be a very difficult problem. 
The 
Incentive-Sensitization 
view of addiction may provide 
some insight as to why effective therapies have been 
elusive, and potentialiy, 
may point the way to the 
development 
of more effective approaches. 
5.7.1. Extinction training. A recent trend in the psy- 
chotherapeutic 
treatment 
of addiction is based on the 
recognition that drug-conditioned 
stimufi are very po- 
tent in eliciting craving and precipitating 
relapsetz9. 
There have been attempts, 
therefore, 
to ‘extinguish’ 
conditioned 
responses to such stimuli. Indeed, the re- 
peated presentation 
of drug-related 
stimuli, in a labo- 
ratory setting, results in a progressive decline in drug 
craving elicited by drug-reIated 
stimuli50,229. It is inter- 
esting, however, that some of the autonomic responses 
to such stimuli are more resistant to extinction than the 
subjective effects, and non-specific 
changes in mood 
state (especially 
anger) can rapidly reinstate 
condi- 
tioned stimulus-induced 
drug craving4’. 
In the context of the Incentive-Sensitization 
Theory 
this might occur because the neuroadaptations 
underly- 
ing sensitization persist, despite extinction of the con- 
ditioned stimulus control of sensitization. 
That is, the 
ability of conditioned 
stimuli to control the expression 
of sensitization may be thought of as learning-related 
neuroadaptations 
layered ‘on-top’ of the neuroadapta- 
tions responsible 
for sensitization, 
but which do not 
directly alter or reverse the neuronal changes responsi-

271 
ble for sensitization. Also, contextual factors that con- 
trol the associative 
attribution 
of incentive 
salience 
may not. transfer 
between 
the clinic and the street. 
Thus, extinction training may extinguish responses to 
specific stimuli under specific circumstances, but other 
non-target 
stimuli can still access sensitized 
neural 
systems mediating incentive salience, as can environ- 
mental stress. On the positive side, the fact that the 
expression of sensitization can be brought under strong 
conditioned 
stimulus control323 suggests it should be 
possible to develop learning strategies to control the 
output of sensitized neural systems. However, the per- 
sistence of the neuroadaptations 
underlying sensitiza- 
tion and their resistance to extinction3B, suggests that 
coping with addiction 
may be a very long, ongoing 
process. Of course, this has been recognized for many 
years by organizations like Alcoholics Anonymous. 
FOT 
example, ~on~ous 
states: “We know that while the 
alcoholic keeps away from drink, as he may do for 
months or years, he reacts much like other men. We 
are equally positive that once he takes any alcohol 
whatever into his system, something happens, both in 
bodily and mental sense, which makes it virtually im- 
possible for him to stop” (ref. 7, p. 22). 
5.7.2. Pharmacotherapeutic 
approaches. The Incentive- 
Sensitization Theory of Addiction also has implications 
for the development 
of effective pharmacotherapies. 
The two major pharma~therapeutic 
approaches 
at 
present 
either 
target 
the treatment 
of withdrawal 
symptoms or involve drug substitution 
therapy 
(e.g., 
methadone 
maintenance). 
The Incentive-Sensitization 
Theory predicts neither 
of these approaches 
will be 
very successful in eliminating 
addictive behavior, be- 
cause neither target the fundamental 
neuroadaptations 
underlying sensitization. 
Of course, many years of ex- 
perience with opiate addicts have already shown that 
the alleviation of withdrawal is not an effective long- 
term solution for addiction363 and the drugs used in 
substitution 
‘therapies’ 
usually are addictive 
them- 
selves363. Furthermore, 
some drugs used to treat with- 
drawa also may induce sensitization8g~202~zo3~*77. 
An Incentive-Sensitization 
view of addiction 
sug- 
gests that to really ‘cure’ addiction agents need to be 
developed that directly target and reverse the neuroad- 
aptations underlying sensitization. 
There are present- 
ly a number of agents known to prevent the develop- 
ment of sensitization, 
including dopamine antagonists 
(See above 
for references) 
and glutamate 
antago- 
nists’61~‘64Y36g 
(cf. ref. 342). Unfortunately, 
these corn-- 
pounds do not reverse the neuroadaptations 
underly~g 
sensitization, 
but only prevent its development 
if they 
are given every time the addictive drug is given. This is 
not a practical approach for the treatment of addiction 
(see Note 1 in Ch. 6). The Incentive-Sensitization 
The- 
ory of Addiction predicts that an especially effective 
pha~acotherapeutic 
agent would reverse 
sensitiza- 
tion-related 
neuroadaptations. 
However, to our knowl- 
edge, no one has identified 
such a compound. 
Of 
course, any rational drug design program will require 
that we know a lot more about the nature of sensitiza- 
tion-related 
neuroadaptations 
than we know at pre- 
sent. 
5.8. Relationship between incentive sensitization and other 
views of addiction 
In 
closing, 
we want 
to emphasize 
that 
the 
Incentive-Sensitization 
Theory of Addiction does not 
exclude other factors that contribute 
to drug-taking 
behavior. 
For 
example, 
the 
Incentive-Sensitization 
Theory does not address a number of features of drug 
use, including why people experiment with drugs in the 
first place (experimental 
drug use), casual (not addic- 
tive) patterns 
of drug use or why people often use 
drugs that do not usually lead to compulsive patterns 
of use (e.g., LSD; see also Note 7 in Ch. 6). The 
Inventive-Sensitization 
Theory of Addiction does not 
preclude 
a role for pleasure-seeking 
and withdrawal 
avoidance 
in drug-taking 
behavior. 
These 
different 
views of addiction are not mutually exclusive, unless 
they are taken as the sole explanations 
for addiction. 
There can be no doubt that addiction results from very 
complex 
interactions 
amongst 
social, cultural, 
eco- 
nomic, psychological 
and biological variables. 
These 
complex interactions 
determine whether experimenta- 
tion with drugs first occurs, whether further drug use is 
sustained 
and whether 
drug use leads to addiction. 
Exactly which factors motivate behavior will vary over 
time and across different drugs. The Incentive-Sensiti- 
zation view does not exclude the possibility, for exam- 
ple, that an explicit memory of drug pleasure 
or a 
conditioned 
‘high’ could contribute 
to a desire to re- 
peat the drug experience in some situations. This may 
be especially 
true early in the development 
of an 
addiction3’j3. Early in the development of an addiction, 
before marked sensitization has occurred, the memory 
of the subjective pleasurable effects of drugs could be a 
major factor motivating drug-taking behavior. FOT ex- 
ample, it has been suggested that the initial subjective 
effects of drugs can predict later drug habitsr20. Also 
drug-taking behavior is influenced 
initially to a great 
extent by social factors, such as peer pressure, 
Neither does the Incentive-Sensitization 
view of ad- 
diction deny that the unpleasant 
s~ptoms 
of with- 
drawal could motivate drug taking in some individuals, 
under some circumstances, 
in order to relieve symp- 
toms. The role of withdrawal avoidance may vary greatly 


----- Page 26 (native text) -----
272 
from drug-to-drug. In some respects drug taking moti- 
vated by pleasure-seeking 
or withdrawaf 
avoidance 
seems ‘normal’; that is, the reasons for drug taking are 
understandable 
to a non-addict. 
For example, recent 
suggestions that drug craving is caused by short-term 
dopamine depietion after drug use are based largely on 
the assumption 
that craving is mereIy a rationaf re- 
sponse to withdrawal 
symptoms63,2”4,3s1. But by our 
view this is not craving; nor is it the fundamental 
problem in addiction. Craving is obsessive, irrational, 
pathologically 
intense drug ‘wanting’ for no obvious 
reason, which leads to compulsive drug-seeking 
and 
drug-taking behavior. Craving is difficult for both the 
addict and the non-addict 
to understand 
and this is 
what we propose is primarily due to sensitization 
of 
incentive salience. 
The Incentive-Sensitization 
Theory of Addiction is 
also compatible with the ‘Psychomotor Stimulant The- 
ory’ of Wise and Bozarth3@. Wise and F30zarth365 ar- 
gued that addictive drugs have in common the ability 
to induce ‘psychomotor 
activation’, which was pro- 
posed to be due to activation of a common biological 
mechanism associated with approach behavior and me- 
diated 
by dopamine. 
This biological 
mechanism 
is 
thought 
to 
be 
fundamental 
in 
producing 
rein- 
forcement”‘,343. The fact that the psychomotor-activat- 
ing effects of addictive drugs are sensitized by repeated 
drug administration 
is certainly 
consistent 
with the 
‘sensitization’ component of the Inventive-Sensit~ation 
Theory. But we further specify here that the psycholog- 
ical process responsible for ‘reward-related’ 
psychomo- 
tor activation is the attribution 
of incentive salience. 
Although incentive salience may lead to locomotion 
and approach, because this psychological process makes 
stimuli in the environment more salient, attractive and 
‘wanted’, these functions 
may be separablez6’. 
For 
example, a brain manipulation 
could induce locomo- 
tion, perhaps by activating brainstem 
locomotor 
pat- 
tern generators, without producing incentive salience; 
and incentive salience could be attributed 
in the ab- 
sence of locomotion 
(for example, in a rat rendered 
cataleptic by morphine, but who still acquires a condi- 
tioned place preference). 
Thus, in our view it is specifi- 
cally the sensitization of incentive salience that makes 
drugs and drug-associated 
stimuli increasingly attrac- 
tive and ‘wanted’. Increased psychomotor 
activation is 
just a correlate of sensitized incentive salience. 
In closing, the ability of the Incentive-Sensitization 
Theory of Addiction to capture the ‘essence’ of addic- 
tive behavior fcompulsive drug seeking and drug tak- 
ing) can be illustrated by a ‘thought experiment’. 
For 
the sake of argument, 
imagine that our assumptions 
regarding the criteria for an adequate theory of addic- 
tion are correct and that the neural system involved in 
assigning incentive salience to drugs and drug-associ- 
ated stimuli is indeed dissociable from those mediating 
the subjective pleasurable effects of drugs. Now imag- 
ine that repeated intermittent 
drug use causes gradual 
and incremental changes in the neural system responsi- 
ble for incentive salience, such that this neural system 
becomes very hypersensitive (sensitized). Further imag- 
ine that the expression 
of this sensitized 
system is 
focussed expressly on stimuli that have become associ- 
ated with its excessive activation, so drugs and drug-as- 
sociated stimuli become irresistibly attractive (‘wanted’) 
and thus able to control 
behavior. 
But the neural 
system(s) responsible for the subjective pleasurable ef- 
fects of drugs either does not change or else becomes 
hyposensitive (tolerant). Finally, imagine that incentive 
salience 
is attributed 
in the absence 
of conscious 
awareness. 
Now consider what a creature 
with this 
brain would be like. An addict, we think. 
6. NOTES 
6.1.1. Control. Although there have been many reports 
of sensitization 
to addictive drugs, it is important 
to 
acknowledge that in nearly all of these studies sensiti- 
zation was induced by non-contingent 
drug treatment. 
That is, the animal’s behavior had no influence 
on 
whether it received a drug or not. It is known, however, 
that drugs can produce different effects depending on 
whether 
they are given in a response-contingent 
or 
response-non-contingent 
manner 309,310. Also, the be- 
havioral sensitization 
to amphet~ine 
or cocaine in- 
duced by footshock stress is influenced by whether an 
animal has control 
in the situation. 
For example, 
MacLennan 
and Maier2’” reported 
that behavioral 
sensitization 
did not occur in rats who could control 
the duration of footshock, but did occur in rats receiv- 
ing an identical amount of shock, but who had no 
control. 
It will be critical to determine, 
therefore, 
whether 
the 
response-contingent 
administration 
of 
drugs induces sensitization. 
There have been very few studies directly addressing 
this issue. We are aware of one report of sensitization 
following experience 
with cocaine self-administration. 
Falk et al.@ tested for behavioral sensitization by chal- 
lenging animals with cocaine 7-10 days after the dis- 
continuation of an oral cocaine self-administration 
reg- 
imen (involving a schedule-induced 
~lydipsia 
para- 
digm). Cocaine-experienced 
animals showed a marked 
shift to the left in the dose-response 
curve for cocaine- 
induced locomotor activity. These data show that sensi- 


----- Page 27 (native text) -----
273 
tbation 
to cocaine 
can occur 
following 
response- 
contingent 
drug a~inistration, 
as well as foilowing 
non-~ntingent 
drug adminis~ation. 
It may also be 
relevant that in self-administration 
studies animals are 
often given non-contingent 
drug injections 
prior to 
training or during shaping, because this facilitates the 
acquisition of a seif-administration 
habit. It is possible 
the development 
of a drug self-administration 
habit is 
facilitated by these procedures 
because they produce 
the kinds of sensitization-related 
neuroadaptations 
un- 
der discussion here (although one also has to consider 
the possibility that prior non-contingent 
administration 
produces tolerance to the aversive properties of drugs). 
6.1.2. Intermittency. On the other hand, sensitization 
was not found in a microdialysis experiment 
involving 
cocaine self-administration 
. 
*43 These researchers found 
that the ability of self-administered 
cocaine to elevate 
extracellular 
dopamine was actually decreased in drug 
experienced 
rats. However, in this experiment the dial- 
ysis test was given 24 h after the last self-administra- 
tion session. Sensitization-related 
changes in dopamine 
neurotransmission 
often 
are not evident 
after such 
short periods of withdrawal, even following non-contin- 
gent drug administration1s8~176~z9s~z96~370. 
This is proba- 
bly because intermittency 
is a critical variable both in 
inducing 
sensitization 
and 
in 
its 
later 
expres- 
sionU2~248~268~272. 
If injections are given too close to- 
gether in time tolerance, rather than sensitization, usu- 
ally occurs. The development 
of sensitization is maxi- 
mized by spacing injections far apart in time (2-3 days 
to a week). Similarly, if a challenge injection is given 
within the first few days after the discontinuation 
of 
escalating 
dose 
amphetamine 
treatment 
behavioral 
sensit~ation 
is not evident. But if a challenge injection 
is given after a longer period of withdrawal, from 1 
week to 1 year, animals are markedly 
sensitized232. 
Thus, sensitization may not be apparent after self-ad- 
ministration 
regimens that allow animals to maintain 
elevated brain levels of a drug for prolonged periods of 
time, especially if animals are tested soon after the end 
of a bout of self-administration. 
It is intriguing that intermittency 
is not only critical 
for inducing sensitization, 
but is thought to play an 
important role in the development 
of many persistent 
and habitual behaviors, including addictive behaviors6. 
Of course, drug-taking behavior in human addicts is 
often characterized 
by intermittency. 
Drugs are fre- 
quently taken in ‘runs’ of self-administration, 
inter- 
spersed with ‘crashes’ lasting a few days. Intermittency 
may also be imposed because a considerable amount of 
time is required to obtain the money necessary to buy 
drugs. Falk and his colleagues86*87 have argued that 
such intermittent 
schedules of drug administration may 
greatly enhance the reinforcing properties of drugs and 
catalyze “drug overindulgence 
in humans”. They state 
“when life’s crucial commodities 
are in short supply 
and available only on intermittent, 
marginal schedules... 
drugs can become all-powerful in reinforcing efficacy” 
(ref. 87, p. 1506). We would only add that the neural 
basis of this effect, in the context of Incentive-Sensiti- 
zation, may involve a facilitation 
of sensitization-re- 
lated neuroadaptations. 
We would expect that an inter- 
mittent pattern of drug self-administration, 
such as a 
cycle of ‘runs’ and ‘crashes’, would produce sensitiza- 
tion of dopamine neurotransmission 
and incentive sali- 
ence2’0, 
6.2. Note 2. Specific motivational effects of dopamine 
blockade 
The literature 
on the effects of dop~ine 
antago- 
nists on motivated behavior has been reviewed exten- 
sively and the reader is referred to papers cited in the 
text for comprehensive 
lists of citations. In brief, some 
of the most clearly motivational 
effects of dopamine 
antagonists 
include the following. (a) Mimicry of ex- 
tinction by dopamine antagonists, in which instrumen- 
tal responses for a food, drug or electrical brain stimu- 
lation decline only gradually after neuroleptic 
adminis- 
tration as though the reinforcer were no longer effica- 
cious (the decline in response is not right away and 
does not occur unless the animal is allowed to perform 
the taskj9’. (b) The associative reinstatement 
of instru- 
mental performance 
after a dopamine antagonist has 
suppressed instrumental responding, by transferring the 
animal to a separate 
task in which it has previously 
been reinforced, 
but in which it has not yet experi- 
enced the drug, and in which it responds again at a 
high level even though the drug is still in effect (i.e., it 
must learn to ‘extinguish’ again in the second task)lo3.

and

paradigms,

by manipulations 
of the 
sensory pleasure of the food: for example, low doses of 
dopamine antagonists mimic the effects upon sucrose 
drinking that are produced by dilution of the sucrose 
solutionl3,53,67,106,308,374

4.3. Note 3. The neural substrate of drug ‘liking’ (plea- 
sure) 
We have argued that mesotelencephalic 
dopamine 
projections 
provide 
the neural 
substrate 
for drug 
‘wanting’ (via attribution of incentive salience), but not 
for drug ‘liking’ (for the subjective pleasurable effects 
of drugs). This naturaily raises the question: what is the 
neural substrate for drug ‘liking’?; for the pleasurable 
affective states produced by addictive drugs? We can- 
not provide a definitive answer to this question, except 
to rule out dopamine, 
but we can point to other 
candidate neural systems. Chief among these are en- 
dogenous opioid neurotransmitter 
systems. Opioid ago- 
nists that increase motivated behavior towards food, 
such as morphine, do enhance the sensory pleasure of 
food as measured 
by the taste reactivity paradigm75. 
Similarly, activation of benzodiazepine-GABA 
systems 
within the brainstem enhances sensory pleasure by the 
taste reactivity measure, 
although it is not yet clear 
whether 
this depends 
on an interaction 
with brain 
opioid systems (ref. 340 for example). In summary, we 
do not know the neural substrate of drug pleasure, but 
these are a couple of candidate 
systems and future 
research may reveal others. 
6.4. Note 
4. Dopamine, 
sensitization and 
incentive 
~~i~e~ce 
There are two issues regarding the neural system(s) 
responsible for sensitization of incentive salience that 
require further discussion. The first concerns elabora- 
tion of exactly which of the many different mesotelen- 
cephalic dopamine projection systems is likely to medi- 
ate incentive salience. We are well aware that there are 
multiple anatomically and functionally distinct mesote- 
lencephalic 
dopamine 
projection 
systems. The extent 
to which the effects of manipulations 
of dopamine 
systems on incentive motivation are due to an action 
on any single one of these dopamine 
systems is not 
always clear. 
The 
contribution, 
for 
example, 
of 
dopamine 
projections 
to the frontal cortex, septum, 
caudate, accumbens (core vs. shell), olfactory tubercle 
or amygdala and the extent to which there may be 
interactions 
between these systems in the assignment 
of incentive salience, is, for the most part, unknown. 
We hesitate, therefore, 
to prematurely 
assign all re- 
sponsibility for incentive salience or the sensitization of 
incentive salience, to a specific dopamine 
projection 
system. This is why we often use the broader 
term, 
mesotelencephalic 
dopamine systems. Nevertheless, we 
recognize that most of the evidence linking mesotelen- 
cephalic dopamine systems to incentive motivation pri- 
marily implicates the so-called mesolimbic dopamine 
projections to the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens). 
Therefore, 
to the extent that {he sensitization of incen- 
tive salience is mediated by a specific dopamine system 
it is probably the dopamine projection 
system to the 
ventral striatum. But we do not discount the possibility 
that other dopamine systems may pIay a role. 
The second issue is whether only dopamine systems 
are involved in the sensitization of incentive salience. 
We have focused on dopamine systems as the site of 
sensitization-related 
neuroadaptations 
for the reasons 
described in the text. We acknowledge, however, that 
the neurobiology 
of drug craving involves much more 
than just a simple sensitization-related 
increase 
in 
dopamine neurotransmission 
and the neural substrate 
of incentive salience is surely much more complicated 
than this. 
For exampIe, Wise and RompreX6s have cautioned 
that “while the evidence is strong that dopamine plays 
some fundamental 
and special role in the rewarding 
effects of brain stimulation, 
psychomotor 
stimulants, 
opiates and food, the exact nature of that role is not 
clear. One thing is clear: dopamine 
is not the only 
reward transmitter 
and dopaminergic 
neurons are not 
the final common path for all rewards” (p. 220). We 
agree with Wise’s caution. To influence motivated be- 
havior 
via 
the 
attribution 
of 
incentive 
salience, 
dopamine systems must interact with many other neu- 
ral systems, especialiy those invoIved in hedonics and 
associative learning. It is also possible that some incen- 
tives may not directly activate dopamine 
systems at 
alli8’ and it is conceivable that some behavior may be 
controlled 
by non-incentive 
based processes, such as 
Skinnerian S-R reinforcement, 
Hullian drive-reduction 
or goal-directed 
computational 
procedures 
(e.g., Test- 
Operate-Test-Exit 
procedures21h) (see Toates339 for a 
discussion of how to distinguish some of these alterna- 
tives). 
The phenomenon 
of behavioral 
sensitization 
also 
surely involves more complex neuroadaptations 
than 
just an enhancement 
in dopamine release, although to 
date most studies of sensitization 
have focussed only 
on dopamine. There is already evidence that the induc- 
tion of sensitization involves a different cellular site of 
drug action than the expression of sensitization’6~,26~, 
that cross-sensitization 
does not occur between all ad- 
dictive drugsi6”,269, that an action of drugs on neural 
systems other than dopamine 
is required 
to induce 
sensitization54’161”~ 
and 
that 
there 
are 
sensitiza- 
tion-related 
changes 
in other 
neurotransmitter 
SYS- 
tems’22,235*3’3+31*. Similarly, Stewart’23 has argued that 
the conditioned 
stimulus control of sensitization 
may 
occur at different 
synaptic sites, depending 
on the 
specific actions of different drugs. All of this suggests 


----- Page 29 (native text) -----
275 
that sensitization involves neuroadaptations 
at multiple 
sites and in multiple neurotransmitter 
systems. 
Nevertheless, in our present state of ignorance it is a 
reasonable working hypothesis that the adaptations 
in 
dopamine 
systems described 
here, involving an en- 
hancement in mesotelencephalic 
dopamine neurotrans- 
mission, form a critical link in a chain of events leading 
to drug craving in addicts. We readily acknowledge, 
however, that some addictive drugs could produce such 
incentive-sensitization 
effects by an action on other, as 
yet unidentified, 
neural systems, including, for exam- 
ple, output pathways from the ventral striatum to the 
ventral pallidum180. On the other hand, it is also possi- 
ble that the dopamine-independent 
rewarding effects 
of some drug treatment 
regimens”l 
involve the activa- 
tion of this same dopamine-incentive 
salience circuitry, 
but at a later stage, ‘downstream’ from dopamine neu- 
rons. Regardless, we want to emphasize that the Incen- 
tive-sensitization 
Theory of Addiction 
does not require 
that the sole or even primary site of drug-induced neu- 
roadaptations responsible for craving specifically be on 
dopamine neurons. If it is not, then our assignment of 
sensitization 
of incentive salience to dopamine would 
be incorrect. Nevertheless, 
the concept that drug crav- 
ing develops 
because 
of sensitization 
of incentive 
salience could still be fundamentally 
correct, 
but it 
would be mediated 
by another, 
as yet unidentified 
neural substrate. 
6.5. Note 5. Tolerance to drug pleasure 
The magnitude 
of the decrease 
in the subjective 
pleasurable effects of drugs is illustrated as being rela- 
tively small in Fig. 3 because, although the develop- 
ment of tolerance 
to the euphoric effects of drugs is 
widely accepted in the clinical literature, there is actu- 
ally very little objective evidence for this. The evidence 
that is usually cited is that addicts tend to gradually 
escalate their dosage with repeated drug use. “One of 
the most insidious aspects of drug abuse is the seem- 
ingly inexorable tendency for addicts to increase their 
drug consumption over time” (ref. 86, p. 81). But Falk 
et al.% point out there is very little evidence linking 
escalation 
in dose with tolerance 
to the subjective 
pleasurable 
effects of drugs. They state: “It is com- 
monly presumed 
that... as tolerance 
develops, more 
drug must be ingested to satiate the addict’s need for 
the drug. It is fascinating that there is little experimen- 
tal data relevant to this assumption 
and that which 
does exist does not support” (p. 81). Indeed, there are 
a number of reports that addicts continue to experi- 
ence euphoria 
even after years of drug use193,211,213. 
Some studies have suggested there even may be an 
increase 
in the pleasurable 
effects of morphine 
in 
long-term addicts, because naive subjects usually rate 
the effects of morphine as unpleasant, whereas experi- 
enced users (‘postaddicts’) 
overwhelmingly 
rate mor- 
phine effects as pleasant 
. 
193 This apparent increase in 
the subjective effects of morphine is probably not due, 
however, to sensitization to its euphoric effects, but to 
tolerance 
to its aversive effects; because ‘postaddicts’ 
also report a lower incidence of nausea and vomiting 
than naive subjects. 
Why then do addicts typically escalate their dose? A 
possible alternative explanation to tolerance of eupho- 
ria is that addicts increase dose to achieve the more 
intense (and more desirable) 
subjective effects pro- 
duced by larger doses. They are able to do this only 
because 
tolerance 
develops to the aversive ‘side-ef- 
fects’ of drugs. That is, addicts increase 
their dose 
because 
they can, without the dire negative effects 
experienced 
by naive users. Doses that might be un- 
pleasant or even life-threatening 
in inexperienced users, 
are ‘tolerated’ by experienced 
users, because of toler- 
ance to many of the drug’s negative effects, including 
effects on the autonomic nervous system. 
On the other 
hand, short-term 
tolerance 
to the 
euphoric effects of drugs may play a role in the escala- 
tion of dose seen when drugs are administered 
in a 
‘run’, as is often the case with amphetamine 
or co- 
caine. If a large supply of amphetamine 
or cocaine is 
readily available addicts often readminister the drug as 
soon as the effects of the previous dose begins to 
dissipate. However, 
if successive administrations 
are 
given too close together in time the positive effects of 
the drug may be ‘masked’ or suppressed by a transient 
depression 
of brain 
‘reward’ 
systems105*174*204. 
As 
pointed out by Stewart324: “Tolerance 
to the rewarding 
effects of opiates has been found in experiments 
in 
which animals were exposed to the drugs continuously 
prior to place preference 
training299” (also see ref. 81) 
and in humans there is a “rapid within-session devel- 
opment of tolerance to the subjective mood effects of 
cocaine, but this dissipated completely within 24 h9’” 
(also see ref. 95). Therefore, 
it may be that dose is 
escalated 
within a run to overcome 
this apparent 
short-term 
tolerance to the pleasurable 
effects of the 
drug. But this may not be relevant to the escalation of 
dose seen over the long-term, that is, between runs. 
In summary, although we indicate 
in Fig. 3 that 
some tolerance develops to the subjective pleasurable 
effects of drugs we are aware that this is a complicated 
and largely unresolved issue. But whether the subjec- 
tive pleasurable 
effects show some tolerance 
or no 
change with repeated 
drug administration, 
the devel- 
opment 
of an addiction 
is still characterized 
by an 
increasing 
dissociation 
between 
‘wanting’ drugs and 


----- Page 30 (native text) -----
276 
‘liking drugs. As Fig. 3 illustrates, 
‘wanting’ drugs, 
produced by the attribution of incentive salience to the 
act of drug taking and to drug-related 
stimuli and their 
mental representations, 
increases dramatically 
during 
addiction; ‘wanting’ evolves into craving. At the same 
time ‘liking’ drugs does not increase. 
6.6. Note 6. The comp~~iue nature of udd~ctive behuvior 
It is interesting to speculate that addictive behavior 
may be so compulsive in nature because the neuroad- 
aptations underlying drug addiction are in some way 
related to other obsessive-compulsive 
disorders. 
It is 
well known that hyperactivi~ 
in dopamine 
systems 
results in behaviors with a highly stereotyped 
(compul- 
sive?) structure. 
For example, relatively low doses of 
amphetamine 
or cocaine elicit high levels of locomotor 
activity and the pattern of Iocomotion 
is abnormally 
stereotyped22’*285. At h’ h 
d 
tg er 
oses locomotor activity is 
diminished 
as animals engage in highly stereotyped, 
narrowly 
focussed, 
repetitive 
behaviors254. 
Similar 
patterns 
of stereotyped 
behavior 
(‘punding’) 
have 
been described 
extensively 
in human 
amphetamine 
users254*286. A number of compulsive behavioral disor- 
ders have been linked to dysfunction in the striatum, 
including obsessive-compulsive 
disorder 
itself, Tour- 
ette’s syndrome, tic disorders18~2”5~25” 
and Huntington’s 
Disease (ref. 59 and N. Wexler, personal communica- 
tion). Thus, there are a number of different disorders 
in which dysfunction in the striatum has been associ- 
ated with compulsive, repetitive thoughts (obsessions) 
and actions (compulsions). 
It is interesting 
to specu- 
late, therefore, that some of the neural changes under- 
lying drug addiction may be, in some respects, similar 
to those responsible 
for other 
obsessive-compulsive 
disorders. 
6.7. Note 7. Benzodiarepines and sedative-hypnotics 
There are drugs of abuse that do not seem to fit this 
profi1e, namely the benz~iazepines 
(BZ) and barbitu- 
rates. These compounds 
have biphasic effects on be- 
havior, producing mild psychomotor 
activation at low 
doses and a marked depression 
of motor activity at 
higher doses 365 but they may not increase dopamine 
, 
neurotransmission. 
Although the psychomotor-activat- 
ing effects of a low dose of diazepam (0.25 mg/kg) has 
been reported 
to require the activation of dopamine 
systems311, microdialysis 
studies have found that di- 
azepam 
and 
midazolam 
decrease 
extracellular 
dopamine in the nucleus accumbens92*‘46 (although in 
these latter studies relatively high doses were used, 
> 0.5 mg/kg). It may be that the Incentive-Sensitiza- 
tion Theory does not account for why these particular 
drugs are used recreationally. 
It should be noted, how- 
ever, the BZ’s are not very addictive and in normal 
experimental 
subjects they have ‘-little or virtualiy no 
reinforcing effects” (ref. 56, p. 142). They do not pro- 
duce the compulsive 
pattern 
of drug-seeking 
and 
drug-taking 
behavior 
characteristic 
of amphetamine, 
cocaine or the opiates37’. Whether the addictive poten- 
tial of alcohol can be accounted for by Incentive-Sensi- 
tization remains to be seen. As cited in the text, there 
are reports 
that alcohol: (1) produces 
psychomotor 
activation, especially in alcohol-preferring 
strains; (2) 
increases 
extracellular 
dopamine; 
and (3) produces 
sensitization. 
But there have been very few studies, 
they are not all consistent and therefore, more work is 
needed to resolve the issue. 
6.8. Note 8. The role of dopamine in mediating the 
effects of conditioned incentiues 
The view of how conditioned incentive stimuli evoke 
relapse proposed here is similar to that of Stewart et 
al.326, except we hypothesize 
drug-associated 
stimuli 
evoke craving by activation of a sensitized neural sys- 
tem that specifically mediates incentive salience. Like 
Stewart et a1.326 we suggest that this neural system 
involves mesotelencephalic 
dopamine projections to the 
ventral striatum and that conditioned 
incentive stimuli 
act much like a ‘priming’ dose of a drug itself; produc- 
ing a small increase in dopaminergic 
activity. The dif- 
ference 
is that we specify the consequence 
of this 
enhanced 
dopamine 
activity to be conditioned 
incen- 
tive salience, not necessarily 
a conditioned 
affective 
state, a ‘high’. We do not deny, however, that condi- 
tioned pleasure can be elicited seperately, presumably 
via associative activation of separate neural systems. 
We need to acknowledge, however, that there has 
been relatively little research on the role of dopamine 
in mediating the effects of conditioned 
incentive stim- 
uli, especially conditioned 
incentive stimuli established 
through their association with drugs. There is consider- 
able evidence 
that activation 
of the ventral 
stria- 
tal dopamine 
system enhances 
responding 
for condi- 
tioned incentive stimuli established by pairing a neutral 
stimulus 
with 
a natural 
incentive, 
like 
food 
or 
water44J27,168J69,262,333,334 
(for reviews see refs, 85, 263). 
There 
is also a genera1 consensus 
that dopamine 
systems 
are critical 
in the process 
by which sti- 
muli 
acquire 
conditioned 
incentive 
properties 
through 
their association 
with natual 
incentives 
or 
drugs 
2,20,21,32,74,77,113,129,219,222.344.352 
(cf. 
refs. 
207,260, 
317). It has been suggested, however, that once ac- 
quired, conditioned 
incentive stimuli may activate be- 
havior independently 
of dopamine. This conclusion is 
based on reports that dopamine receptor blockade with 
pimozide (or in one experiment, haloperidol) 
does not

277 
prevent the ~nditioned 
p~chomotor 
activation evoked 
by a conditioned 
stimulus associated with food139, or 
drugszo&?i,~~z; although 
the absolute 
amount 
of psy- 
chomotor activation produced by a food-associated 
CS 
is reduced’39. This idea is controversial, 
however, be- 
cause others have reported 
that dopamine antagonism 
does attenuate the expression of conditioned 
‘prepara- 
tory behaviors’ (including locomotor activity) produced 
by a ~nditioned 
stimulus signaling food31+32,33 
(also see 
ref. 3531, as well as conditioned 
responses established 
by drugs76*77*1r3*“30*27. 
Also, under 
some conditions 
dopamine 
~tagonists 
may induce gradual extinction- 
like effects on conditioned 
responding3@,3M. Such ef- 
fects may be inte~reted 
by the h~thesis 
that low 
doses of dopamine antagonists impair the ‘reboosting’ 
of incentive salience to established conditioned stimuli, 
which could occur each time an incentive stimulus is 
encountered. 
This ‘reboosting’ may be essential for the 
maintainen~ 
of a conditioned 
response27. 
Direct measures of dopamine neurotransmission 
also 
support the hypothesis that this neural system mediates 
the incentive effects of conditioned 
stimuli3’. Condi- 
tioned stimuli predictive of food have been reported 
to increase 
the discharge 
rate 
of dopamine 
neu- 
rons1~,‘~~~7~~9, to increase dopamine 
metabolism 
in 
the nucleus accumbens34 and to increase a chronoam- 
perometric 
signal 
thought 
to 
reflect 
extracellular 
dopamine 
. 
u9 Similarly, conditioned 
stimuli associated 
with psychomotor stimulants or opiates are reported to 
enhance 
dopamine 
metabolism191,~~283, to elevate a 
dopamine-related 
electrochemical 
signal 
associated 
with cocaine’“’ and in the presence 
of the uncondi- 
tioned stimulus, to elevate dopamine 
in dialysate=*. 
On the other hand, negative results have been reported 
as wel116V38*39*g3,348 
and therefore, 
more work is needed 
to resolve the discrepancies. 
Not only do pleasant 
natural 
incentives, 
such as 
food, water and access to a mate activate mesotelen- 
cephalic dopamine 
systems X,66,126,214,246,376, 
but 
so 
do 
some presumably unpleasant aversive events, including 
classical stressors. Stressors are particularly effective in 
activating dopamine projections 
to the medial frontal 
cortex and to the shell of the nucleus accumbens1,71,3~. 
Intense aversive stimuli may also activate the nigrostri- 
atal dopamine 
system’. Conditioned 
stressors (previ- 
ously neutral stimuli paired with an aversive event) can 
activate mesoteiencephahc 
dopamine 
systems as well, 
increasing dopamine metabolism in the frontal cortex’= 
and the concentration 
of dopamine in nucleus accum- 
bens dialysate377. What does this mean for the hypoth- 
esis that dopamine 
mediates 
incentive 
salience and 
that dopaminergic 
activation makes stimuli salient, at- 
tractive and ‘wanted’? 
There are at least two alternative explanations that 
can reconcile 
stress-induced 
activation 
of dopamine 
and the incentive-sensitization 
hypothesis 
and until 
further 
data are available the incentive salience hy- 
pothesis does not commit to either one. First, it is 
possible that mesote1encephalic 
dopamine systems me- 
diate the salience of stimuli that signal unpleasant 
consequences 
as well as those that signal pleasant 
ones. The rustling noise that signals an approaching 
tiger should grab the attention no less than the sight of 
delectable 
food. The salience of both tiger and food 
may be mediated 
by dopamine 
systems, whereas the 
valence of that salience (attractive incentive vs. fright- 
ening warning) may be determined 
by the coactivation 
of other neural systems. A second possibility is that 
moderate 
levels of dopamine 
activation, such as that 
produced by natural incentives and stressors (see above 
for 
references), 
always makes 
stimuli 
attractively 
salient, whereas even higher levels of dogamine activa- 
tion makes stimuli frightening. 
Is it non-sensical to say that stress can make stimu1i 
more attractive? 
Not at all. Stressors are known to 
potentiate 
behavior that is ordinarily incentive-based. 
For example, stress-induced 
feeding is a phenomenon 
that has been we11 documented 
in both animals and 
humans’02223. Stress 
may 
cause 
mesotelencephalic 
dopamine 
systems to magnify the incentive salience 
attributed 
to known incentives such as familiar foods, 
thus leading to increased eating. Furthermore, 
stres- 
sors themselves 
may sometimes 
fascinate 
and elicit 
approach, 
rather than drive an individual away. For 
example, in a laboratory 
mode1 of predator 
mobbing 
rats will repeatedly approach an electrified object that 
has in the past given them a shock and will attempt to 
bury the offending object by pushing sand, etc. upon 
it245. Also, under particular 
conditions 
animals wiIl 
work (lever press) to deliver electric shocks to them- 
selves, shocks that are known to be otherwise aversive 
(ref. 86 for review). Indeed, rats will even bar press to 
self-administer 
corticosterone 
iv., in doses that pro- 
duce a plasma concentration 
comparable 
to that seen 
during mild stress and this is associated with an in- 
crease in nucleus accumbens dopamine neurotransmis- 
sion*‘@. Furthermore, 
animals that are more prone to 
acquire a drng self-administration 
habit are more sen- 
sitive to the reinforcing 
effects of corticosterone 
than 
‘IOW risk’ animals. Corticosterone 
also produces a larger 
increase in dopamine neurotransmission 
in ‘high risk 
animals than in ‘low risk’ animals*&. These examples 
suggest that stress-induced 
dopamine 
activation may 


----- Page 32 (native text) -----
278 
indeed activate incentive processes - quite separately 
from their activation of pain, aversion or discomfort. 
Which of these alternatives best describes the role of 
dopaminergic 
salience attribution 
during stress and in 
response 
to aversive stimuli will require 
further 
re- 
search to resolve. 
In the examples above we suggest that the moderate 
level of dopamine 
activation produced 
by natural in- 
centives and even stressors, may increase 
incentive 
salience. Likewise, we posit that a moderate 
level of 
dopamine activation produced 
by addictive drugs en- 
hances incentive 
salience 
and the higher levels of 
dopamine activation produced 
by increasing doses of 
addictive drugs may progressively 
increase incentive 
salience. 
The ability of addictive 
drugs to elevate 
dopamine 
neurotransmission 
beyond that which nor- 
mally occurs may be the feature of drugs that make 
them such potent incentives. However, this may be true 
only up to a point. Exceedingly high levels of dopamine 
activation may sometimes result in markedly aversive 
experiences. 
Although 
the attribution 
of incentive 
salience can make stimuli in the environment ‘brighter’ 
and more attractive, beyond a certain point the world 
may become too ‘bright’: stimuli may become confus- 
ing, distracting and potentially 
frightening. For exam- 
ple, the hallucinations and terror of amphetamine 
psy- 
chosis may reflect 
the excessive and indiscriminate 
attribution 
of salience to all stimuli in general, by a 
wildly hyper~n~tioning 
dopamine system. The sensiti- 
zation of dopamine neurotransmission 
may explain why 
the propensity 
to amphetamine 
or cocaine psychosis 
usually develops 
in a progressive, 
sensitization-like 
fashion and why the susceptibility to stimulant-induced 
(or stress-induced) 
psychosis persists for years after the 
discontinuation 
of drug use279*280. 
The symptoms of stimulant-induced 
psychosis are 
very similar to those seen in paranoid schizophrenia292 
and the suggestion that they are due to wildly excessive 
incentive salience is consistent with some current hy- 
potheses regarding the nature of schizophrenia. 
It has 
been 
suggested331, for example, 
that, 
“mesolimbic 
dopamine activation may regulate the extent to which 
particular types of environmental 
cues elicit or shape 
appetitive behavior”... 
and a loss of this ‘gating’ func- 
tion by the overactivation 
of dopamine systems “may 
result in cognitive ‘flooding’, information overload and 
cognitive fragmentation 
in clinical states putatively as- 
sociated with dopamine 
overactivity 
[such as schizo- 
phrenia]37,321*332” (p. 419). 
6.10. Note 10. Dopamine antagonists and therapy 
At first sight, it might appear that an implication of 
the Incentive-Sensitization 
Theory is that an effective 
treatment 
for excessive craving would be to block 
dopamine receptors with a postsynaptic antagonist such 
as pimozide or haloperidol. 
However, it is not at all 
clear that such a treatment would be effective. In fact, 
there are several reasons for doubting the usefulness of 
dopamine antagonists as a treatment for addiction. 
Even though the Inventive-Sensitization 
Theory pro- 
poses that excessive craving for drugs results directly 
from 
sensitization 
of dopamine 
neurotransmission, 
dopamine antagonists may not be as useful in reducing 
the expression of pre-established 
incentives (attribu- 
tion of incentive salience that is directed by existing 
associations) as they are in blocking the acqu~it~on of 
new incentiues (attribution 
of incentive salience to pre- 
viously neutral stimuli): An addict is already too late 
for a treatment that blocks the acquisition of incentive 
sensitization 
to work. Only a treatment 
that blocked 
the expression of sensitized incentive salience would be 
helpful. 
A large body of evidence from animal studies of 
dopamine 
antagonist 
effects on incentive motivation 
indicates that while the acquisition of, for example, a 
~nditioned 
preference 
for an environment paired with 
drug administration 
is nearly always blocked 
by a 
dopamine 
antagonist, 
the behavioral 
expression of a 
preference 
that was previously 
conditioned 
is only 
sometimes suppressed by the same drug (see the afore- 
mentioned 
Note 8). There are a number of possible 
explanations 
for the equivocal 
effects of dopamine 
antagonists on the expression of pre-existing incentives. 
First, it might be that dopamine antagonists actually do 
reduce 
the incentive 
salience of drug-paired 
condi- 
tioned stimuli, but that they also reduce the incentive 
salience of ail other stimuli. This would produce 
an 
absolute reduction of all incentive motivation but would 
leave the relative incentive value of stimuli unchanged 
(ref. 139 for example). Although an addict might crave 
drugs less after taking a dopamine 
antagonist, drugs 
would still be wanted more than anything else and drug 
seeking would still dominate behavior. Second, it might 
be that the neural processes that mediate the expres- 
sion of sensitized 
incentive 
salience truly are more 
resistant to the effects of dopamine antagonists than 
are the neural processes which mediate the establish- 
ment of sensitization. 
If so, only very high doses of 
neuroleptics, 
which might seriously disrupt many as- 
pects of normal behavior, would be sufficient to sup- 
press drug craving. We do not know why this should be 
true, but there are a number of possible mechanisms 
that could explain it. For example, once established 
sensitization 
might be associated 
with neuroadapta- 
tions 
that 
extend 
to 
systems 
‘downstream’ 
from 
dopamine 
neurons themselves. These neural systems 


----- Page 33 (native text) -----
279 
may continue to respond excessively even if dopamine 
neurotransmission 
is reduced. On the other hand, the 
a~uisition 
of ~nsitization 
may depend more specifi- 
cally upon dopamine activation alone. 
Another possibility is that the acquisition vs. expres- 
sion 
of 
sensitization 
are 
mediated 
by 
different 
dopamine subsystems that have, for example, different 
dopamine 
receptor 
subtypes, etc. Hiroi and Whiter30 
noted that when a dopamine receptor antagonist failed 
to selectively decrease 
the expression of conditioned 
responding (see the aforementioned 
Note 8) “neuro- 
leptics with a higher affinity for D2 than Dl receptors”, 
were used and further 
noted that “a Dl antagonist, 
SCH23390 is equally effective in blocking acquisition 
and expression of an amphetamine 
conditioned 
place 
preference, 
whereas much higher doses of D2 antago- 
nists are required to block expression than acquisition. 
Thus, some workers may have failed to observe block- 
ing of the expression of learned behaviors because they 
used an inappropriate 
dose range of D2 antagonists” 
(pp. 40,41). 
Finally, even if neuroleptic 
drugs were effective at 
suppressing drug craving at moderate doses, their use- 
fulness could be compromised 
by the possibility that 
addicts would refuse to take them. Anecdotal evidence 
abounds 
to suggest that neuroleptics 
are unpopular 
drugs among patients who take them. Aside from their 
potential 
motor effects, it is not surprising that this 
should be so. By the incentive salience hypothesis, 
a 
drug that directly suppressed the attribution of incen- 
tive salience would make the world ‘less bright’. Even 
though the neural substrates of pleasure would not be 
suppressed, such a drug could produce ‘sham anhedo- 
nia’ - that is, the conscious inference by the addict that 
pleasure was reduced via cognitive inte~retation 
(,‘I 
don’t want anything very much, therefore 
I must not 
like anything”) - just as direct activation of incentive 
salience should produce ‘sham reward’“. 
7. GLOSSARY 
Addiction. There has been considerable debate regard- 
ing the appropriate 
definition 
of drug addiction. We 
will use the term here in the sense proposed 
by a 
World 
Health 
Organization 
Expert 
Committee 
in 
198179,‘48. Drug addiction is defined as “a syndrome in 
which the use of a drug is given a much higher priority 
than other behaviors that once had higher value.“... 
“In its extreme 
form [addiction] 
is associated 
with 
compulsive 
drug-using 
behavior 
and it exhibits the 
characteristics 
of a chronic relapsing disorder” 
(ref. 
148, p. 522). The phrase ‘addictive behavior’ is used to 
refer collectively to obsessive drug craving and to corn- 
pulsive drug-seeking and drug-taking behavior. 
Addictive ~~auior. (see Addiction) 
Appetitive motivation. (see Incentive motivation) 
Aversion. The subjective experience 
of a sensation as 
actively unpleasant 
or the underlying evaluative pro- 
cesses and neural mechanisms 
that directly produce 
this subjective experience. The opposite of pleasure or 
euphoria (see Pleasure). Aversion results from an ac- 
tive evaluation 
of a sensation 
carried out by brain 
systems. In the context of addiction, aversion can be 
synonymous with the symptoms associated with drug 
withdrawal, including physical distress and dysphoria. 
Aversion can also refer to direct subjective effects 
produced 
by a drug that can be discriminated 
from 
pleasure by the user. 
Conditioned incentive stimuli. (see Incentives) 
Craving and ‘Wanting’. These are used in accordance 
with their usual English meaning, which for ‘wanting’ 
refers to the subjective experience of needing or desir- 
ing something (“to feel a need or desire for”; Random 
House Dictionary of the English Language, 2nd edn., 
1987). We further propose, however, that this experi- 
ence is produced 
by the psychological 
process 
of 
salience attribution (see incentive salience), that is, the 
attribution of incentive salience to an external event or 
its mental representation. 
The process of incentive 
salience attribution 
is pre-concious 
and only the result 
of this psychological process is accessible to conscious- 
ness. When this occurs it is interpreted228 as a subjec- 
tive feeling of ‘wanting’. For our purposes craving and 
‘wanting’ differ only in magnitude: craving equals in- 
tense “wanting’ls4. In the addict, craving is the experi- 
ence associated with excessive incentive salience, which 
results from drug-induced 
sensitization 
of the neural 
systems that attribute salience to incentives.

Incentiue motivation(a1). A psychological theory (also 
see Fig. 2) of how goal-direction 
is controlled 
by the 
stimulus properties 
of the target30,33g. Incentive moti- 
vation is one of a number of potential 
psychological 
mechanisms for controlling the direction of motivated 
behavior. Drive reduction and opponent processes are 
examples of other potential 
mechanisms 
that might 
control behavior independently 
of incentive processes 
(see Toates339 for discussion and evidence). 
Incentive motivation appears to be the chief mecha- 
nism that controls behavior directed towards natural 
incentives such as food, water and a potential mate and 
towards more artificial incentives, such as self-adminis- 
tered drugs and reinforcing

tion and appetitive motivation are synonymous: that is, 
appetitive motivation works primarily through incen- 
tive processes 
. 
33y Incentive motivation directed towards 
particular stimuli results from the outcome of a three- 
stage process. First, the neural substrates for pleasure 
are activated by the consequences of a particular act or 
event. Second, pleasure is associated with the object, 
act, event or place in which pleasure occurs by the 
processes 
of classical 
associative 
learning. 
Third, 
salience is attributed 
to subsequent 
perceptions 
and 
mental representations 
of the associated object, act, 
event or place, by a separate neural system from those 
responsible for the first two processes. This third pro- 
cess of salience attribution 
(incentive salience) is pro- 
posed here to involve dopamine. 
The attribution 
of 
incentive salience causes the associated 
situation to 
become attractive and ‘wanted’ and it is this psycholog- 
ical process that produces the direct manifestation 
of 
incentive motivation: goal-directed 
seeking and instru- 
mental behavior. 
Incentirre salience. Refers to the attractiveness of exter- 
nal stimuli, events, places and their mental representa- 
tions; their ability to capture attention (also see Fig. 2). 
The term, incentive 
salience, 
applies &ways to the 
perception of external events and to internal represen- 
tations of those events. Incentive 
salience must be 
actively generated 
(attributed) 
by the brain and as- 
signed to particular 
perceptions 
and representations, 
based on their 
association 
with past activation 
of 
mesotelencephalic 
dopamine 
systems. For any given 
stimulus incentive salience will vary at different times 
depending 
upon changes in learned 
associations 
re- 
garding the stimulus, the internal state of the perceiver 
and most specifically, the degree of activation of the 
dopamine systems that mediate incentive salience. In- 
centive salience is one of a number of psychological 
mechanisms that can produce direct behavior (other 
mechanisms include drive reduction and goal-directed 
computational 
algorithms that do not depend on mod- 
ulated perception of the goal; see Toates339). Incentive 
salience constitutes 
one component 
of the complex 
process of incentive motivation. ~~hough 
the assign- 
ment of incentive 
salience to an event normally is 
triggered by a pleasurable experience, manipulations of 
dopamine 
systems can disconnect 
incentive 
salience 
from pleasure 
and alter incentive 
salience indepen- 
dently. It is h~othesized 
that the attribution of incen- 
tive salience to an event or representation 
is an uncon- 
scious process; only the product of this process, the 
perception of the object as ‘wanted’, is interpreted 
and 
consciously experienced. 
hcentice 
stimuli ~~~~e~t~ues~. Stimuli that have been 
attributed with incentive salience. The perception 
and 
mental representation 
of these stimuli are t~nsfo~ed 
as a consequence 
and as incentive stimuli they become 
salient, attractive, ‘wanted’, and approached. The terms 
nufuruf ~cent~z~es and urti~c~~Z ~~ce~tive~ are also used. 
The 3-stage process described for incentive motivation 
evolved to enable animals and humans to recognize 
and respond to ‘natural’ incentives. By natural incen- 
tives we mean stimuli such as food, water, social and 
sexual partners, thermal and tactile sensations, which 
have been endowed by evolution with the capacity to 
elicit pleasure and incentive salience under particular 
conditions (e.g., under certain hormonal conditions). 
Most natural incentives exert their effects via sensory 
receptors. 
‘Artificial’ incentives, on the other hand, 
such as addictive drugs or electrical brain stimulation, 
bypass sensory receptors 
and activate the component 
processes of incentive motivation more directly. Most 
incentive 
stimuli are conditioned 
incentive 
stimuli: 
stimuli that have become incentives as a consequence 
of associative learning during the three-stage 
process 
described for incentive motivation. Conditioned 
ineen- 
tive stimuli not only include the arbitrary lights and 
sounds used in laboratory 
experiments 
(e.g., an audi- 
tory tone that signals food delivery), but also the stimu- 
lus configurations that must be learned through experi- 
ence that allow natural incentives to be recognized 
(e.g., the sight of a delectable 
food; the sound of a 
loved one’s voice). Conditioned 
incentive stimuli are 
often referred 
to as conditioned 
rewards (see below), 
secondary rewards or secondary reinforcers (see below). 
“Liking’. See Pleasure. 
Negative reinforcement. See Reinforcement). 
F~e~sure and ‘liking: These are used in accordance 
with their usual English meaning, which refers to the 
subjective experience 
of a sensation as pleasurable or 
hedonic and the underlying evaluative and neural pro- 
cesses that directly produce this subjective experience. 
The opposite of aversion (see above). Pleasure is usu- 
ally the first stage of the larger process of incentive 
motivation (together with incentive salience and asso- 
ciative learning) and serves as the normal trigger that 
activates components of associative learning and incen- 
tive salience. By itself, however, pleasure is not equiva- 
lent to either reward or ‘wanting’: it is merely a subjec- 
tive experience or feeling. The evaluation of the sensa- 
tion that produces pleasure is pre-conscious; 
only the 
product, the subjective pleasure, is experienced. 
In the 
present paper and in the context of addiction, the term 
pleasure is used synon~ously 
with the terms eupho- 
ria, hedonia or positive affective state.

Positive uflectiue state. (see Pleasure). 
Positive reinforcement. (see Reinforcement). 
reinforcement. A purely 
behavioral 
and descriptive 
term for the relationship between the occurrence 
of a 
stimulus and changes in the subsequent probability of 
the behavior that preceded 
it. Reinforcement 
denotes 
a change in the probability of a behavior (increased or 
decreased) 
that is contingent on presentation 
of stim- 
uli. Reinforcement 
does not offer either a psychologi- 
cal explanation 
or a physiological e~lanation 
of why 
the probability 
of a behavior 
is changed; 
it merely 
notes the existence of the change. Reinforcement 
can 
be positive or negative. Positive reinforcement 
refers to 
increases in the probability of emission of a behavior 
produced by subsequent presentation 
of a stimulus (the 
positive reinforcer). 
In the context of addiction 
the 
term positive re~forcement 
is sometimes used both in 
its proper descriptive sense and sometimes in the theo- 
retical or explanatory 
sense of reward (see below), 
where the pleasure produced 
by a drug is implicitly 
assumed as a psychological explanation for the change 
in behavior. In order to avoid ambiguity in the present 
paper we use positive reinforcement 
only in its proper 
descriptive sense. Negative reinfor~ment 
refers to in- 
creases in the probability 
of emission of a behavior 
produced by subsequent omission or termination 
of a 
stimulus. For example, 
in the context of addiction, 
drugs may act as negative reinforcers 
by relieving the 
distress of drug withdrawal. 
Reward. The word reward is used in the literature 
in 
many different ways and for the most part we avoid the 
term. For us, the process of reward is essentially equiv- 
alent to the process of incentive motivation; 
that is, 
reward refers to the process of creating incentives (or, 
as a noun, a stimulus that triggers this process). Re- 
wards (or incentives) 
cause future 
behavior 
to be 
changed in a goal-directed fashion so as to obtain again 
the situation or stimulus that triggered 
the process. 
This process normally requires three separate stages. 
The first stage is the activation of pleasure 
by the 
consequences 
of a particular act or event. In the sec- 
ond stage pleasure is associated with a mental repre- 
sentation 
of the object, act, event or place in which 
pleasure occurred, by the process of classical (associa- 
tive) ~nditioning. 
The third stage involves the attribu- 
tion of incentive 
salience to subsequent 
perceptions 
and representations 
of the associated object, act, event 
or place, which causes them to become ‘wanted’. Stim- 
uli that signal the availabili~ of the incentive become 
attractive. Acts that led to the situation in the past are 
likely to be repeated. 
New acts, which the animal or 
person can predict (cognitively) will lead to the incen- 
tive in the future, are likely to be produced. 
If the 
three stages of normal reward (pleasure, 
associative 
learning, incentive salience) are separated, the process 
remains 
incomplete. 
Some 
separations 
have been 
achieved 
by brain manipulations; 
others 
are useful 
simply as illustrative ‘thought experiments’. If the first 
stage of pleasure is activated without associative leam- 
ing or salience attribution, then it is merely an isolated 
hedonic experience that remains unconnected 
to other 
events in the world or to subsequent behavior. If the 
first two stages occur alone so that pleasure is activated 
in conjunction with associative learning only, then asso- 
ciative conditioning of pleasure will occur to the associ- 
ated events, but they will not be attributed with incen- 
tive salience. The events will become ‘liked’, but they 
will not be ‘wanted’ (this separation 
may possibly be 
achieved by destruction of brain dopamine systems?. 
Conversely, 
if the third stage, incentive 
salience, is 
activated alone, then ‘wanting’ arises in isolation from 
other processes. This may be achieved, for example, by 
a stimulating 
electrode 
that directly activates brain 
dopamine systems2’. If salience attribution is magnified 
abnormally 
in conjunction 
with associative 
learning, 
but pleasure 
is not, for example, by the process of 
drug-induced 
sensitization discussed here, then the at- 
tribution of incentive salience becomes intensified and 
focused narrowly on the stimuli and acts associated 
with drug administration 
and they become pathologi- 
cally ‘wanted’ (craved). This may be considered a type 
of ‘sham reward’, which shapes instrumental 
behavior 
and creates craving, but is dissociated from pleasure. 
Viewed from the outside, the behavior produced 
by 
sham reward and natural reward is identical on all 
measures 
of ‘wanting’ or instrumental 
performance. 
Only behavioral measures that are specifically sensitive 
to pleasure - rather than wanting - will identify sham 
reward (without pleasure) as distinct from natural re- 
ward (triggered by pleasure). 
Salience. A salient stimulus is a stimulus that has been 
(or is being) attributed 
with incentive salience (see 
above). Salience refers to the feature(s) of the percept 
or representation 
of a stimulus that makes it highly 
noticeable and difficult to ignore. A salient stimulus is 
not merely more obvious, but it also becomes ‘wanted 
and attractive 
because, according to our usage, it is 
incentive salience that is attributed 
to the percept or 
mental representation 
(but see Note 9 in Ch. 6 on 
aversive salience).
