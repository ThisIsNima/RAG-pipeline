We have systematically made a set of precisely deﬁned, single-gene deletions of all nonessential
genes in Escherichia coli K-12. Open-reading frame coding regions were replaced with a kanamycin
cassette ﬂanked by FLP recognition target sites by using a one-step method for inactivation of
chromosomal genes and primers designed to create in-frame deletions upon excision of the
resistance cassette. Of 4288 genes targeted, mutants were obtained for 3985. To alleviate problems
encountered in high-throughput studies, two independent mutants were saved for every deleted
gene. These mutants—the ‘Keio collection’—provide a new resource not only for systematic
analyses of unknown gene functions and gene regulatory networks but also for genome-wide
testing of mutational effects in a common strain background, E. coli K-12 BW25113. We were unable
to disrupt 303 genes, including 37 of unknown function, which are candidates for essential genes.

Introduction
The increased availability of genome sequences has provided
the basis for comprehensive understanding of organisms at the
molecular level. Besides sequence data, a large number of
experimental and computational resources are required for
genome-scale analyses. Escherichia coli K-12 has been one of
the best-characterized organisms in molecular biology. Yet,
many key resources for functional genomics and systems
biology studies of E. coli are still lacking.
Whole genome sequences are now available for two closely
related K-12 strains, MG1655 (Blattner et al, 1997) and W3110
(Hayashi et al, 2006). Whole-genome comparative sequencing
and reconciliation of differences by re-sequencing selected
regions from both strains have recently provided the most
accurate genome of any organism (accompanying manuscript;
Hayashi et al, 2006). Of 267 regions that were initially found to
have short insertion or deletion (indel) and nucleotide (nt)
disparities, only eight sites were found to be true differences.
The vast majority (243) were due to errors in the original 4.5-
Mb E. coli K-12 MG1655 genome (an error rate of less than 1
per 13 000 nt 8 years later); 16 were due to errors in the 2.6 Mb
of the W3110 genome reported from 1992 to 1997. Sequence
corrections resulted in major changes in the translation of 111
MG1655 open-reading frames (ORFs), mostly due to frame
shifting (85), but also due to gene ﬁssions (2), gene fusions
(23), and inversion (1; Hayashi et al, 2006).
The availability of highly accurate E. coli K-12 genomes
(Hayashi et al, 2006) provided an impetus for the cooperative
re-annotation of both MG1655 and W3110 (Riley et al, 2006).
Sequence corrections also changed many gene boundaries,
which led to dropping 31 previously annotated genes and
adding 66 new ones. The composite K-12 genome has 4453
genes, encoding 4296 ORFs (including 74 pseudogenes), 156
RNAs, and one annotated feature (oriC). Major differences
between the MG1655 and W3110 genomes are the 12
additional sites of an insertion sequence (IS) in W3110, and
one additional IS site and the defective CPZ-55 phage (seven
prophage genes) only in MG1655. Consequently, MG1655 and
W3110 have two and 17 extra copies of IS genes, respectively,
and MG1655 has 11 and W3110 has 21 unique genes (including
seven additional pseudogenes). Thus, on the basis of the 2005
annotation snapshot, MG1655 has a total of 4464 genes and
W3110 has 4474 (Hayashi et al, 2006). In addition to updating
annotations of gene functions, start sites were changed for 682
MG1655 ORFs (Riley et al, 2006). An additional 76 ORFs that
have been predicted in W3110 have been targeted, for a total
of 4550 genes encoding 4390 ORFs (Hayashi et al, 2006),

although these have not been recognized as ORFs in the recent
K-12 annotation workshops.
An E. coli K-12 functional genomics project was initiated in
Japan to (1) create new experimental resources, (2) establish
new
analysis
methods,
(3)
develop
new
computational
approaches, (4) improve databases, and (5) analyze gene
function through experimentation by using these resources,
methods, approaches, and databases (Mori et al, 2000). Newly
created experimental resources now include: (a) two E. coli K-12
ORFeome plasmid banks of nearly all predicted ORFs, the
ASKA clone sets (Kitagawa et al, 2005), (b) a large collection of
transposon-generated gene-disruption mutants (Mori et al,
2000), and (c) mutants individually deleted of all nonessential
E. coli K-12 genes (this study). Newly established analysis
methods have included DNA microarrays (Oshima et al, 2002b),
proteome analysis tools (Katayama et al, 2002), and tagged genes
for detecting protein–protein interactions (Arifuzzaman et al,
2006). Newly developed computational approaches have in-
cluded tools for gene clustering and codon usage diversity
(Kanaya et al, 2001). An improved E. coli K-12 GenoBase (version
5.0; http://ecoli.aist-nara.ac.jp/) supports data analysis based
on these new resources, analysis methods, and computational
approaches. These resources and methods have been helpful for
assignment of new cellular roles to many genes of unknown or
poorly described function (e.g. Oshima et al, 2002a).
In a Saccharomyces cerevisiae functional genomics project, a
nearly complete set of single-gene deletions covering 96% of
yeast annotated ORFs was constructed by using a PCR gene
replacement method (Giaever et al, 2002). The yeast mutants
were isolated by direct transformation with PCR products
encoding kanamycin resistance and containing 45-nt ﬂanking
homologous sequences for adjacent chromosomal regions.
Genome-scale disruption of Bacillus subtilis genes (Kobayashi
et al, 2003) was carried out by inactivating each gene with
a gene-speciﬁc plasmid clone. Comprehensive transposon
mutagenesis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was carried out by
generating a large set (30100) of sequence-deﬁned mutants
(Jacobs et al, 2003).
Two groups began projects to construct comprehensive
transposon mutant libraries of E. coli K-12. In Japan,
chromosomal segments in a phage l library (Kohara et al,
1987) were subjected to transposon mutagenesis, after which
the mutations were recombined onto the chromosome by
homologous recombination (Mori et al, 2000; T Miki, personal
communication). The other group subjected PCR products
encoding ORFs to in vitro Tn5 transposition (Goryshin et al,
2000), and then recombined the mutations onto the chromo-
some by l Red-mediated recombination (Datsenko and
Wanner, 2000), which led to the creation of insertion alleles
for 1976 ORFs (Kang et al, 2004).
Although transposon mutagenesis has yielded large unique
collections of valuable mutants, the methodologies for
building a comprehensive library are laborious. First, it is
necessary to deﬁne the insertion sites by PCR or DNA
sequencing. Second, rearrangements or genetic duplications
can result when recombining mutations onto the chromo-
some, compounding results, and requiring additional testing.
Third, complications resulting from transposon mutagenesis,
such as incomplete disruption of the targeted gene and polarity
effects on downstream genes, are unavoidable.
While the project for building a transposon library was
underway in Japan, a highly efﬁcient method for direct
inactivation of chromosomal genes in E. coli K-12 was reported
(Datsenko and Wanner, 2000). This breakthrough provided a
simple and efﬁcient method for gene deletion analogous to the
one that has been used in yeast (Baudin et al, 1993), except
by use of cells carrying an easily curable, low-copy-number
plasmid expressing the l Red recombinase. Advantages are
being able to target genes for complete deletion, to design
deletions arbitrarily and precisely, and to easily eliminate the
antibiotic resistance marker subsequently. Here, we used the l
Red system for the systematic construction of a set E. coli K-12
mutants with precisely deﬁned single-gene deletions, called
the Keio collection, which upon release of the resistance
marker will leave behind an in-frame deletion. For conve-
nience of gene transfer, the Keio collection retains the
resistance marker.
Results and discussion
Keio collection mutants
The Keio collection is comprised of 3985 deletions in duplicate
(7970 total) of E. coli K-12 strain BW25113 (Datsenko
and Wanner, 2000), a strain with a well-deﬁned pedigree that
has not been subjected to mutagens (Figure 1; Supplementary
Table 1). Mutants were directly selected as kanamycin-
resistant (KmR) colonies after electroporation of BW25113
carrying the l Red expression plasmid pKD46 (Datsenko and
Wanner, 2000). To alleviate problems that can arise in high-

has the rpoS396(Am) allele (codon 33, TAG (Am); unpublished data). Strain
BW25113 was derived from BD792 in a series of steps involving generalized
transduction and allele replacements, which included introducing the pseudo-
reversion rpoS (Q33) allele from MG1655 into a predecessor of BW25113
(Supplementary Table 1). The derivation of W3110 is shown in Figure 1 of

throughput experiments, resulting from handling errors,
crosscontamination, and accumulation of secondary muta-
tions, two independent mutants were saved for each deletion.
Design of in-frame, single-gene deletion mutants
Chromosomal genes were targeted for mutagenesis with
PCR products containing a resistance cassette ﬂanked by FLP
recognition target (FRT) sites and 50-bp homologies to
adjacent chromosomal sequences (Figure 2). To reduce polar
effects on downstream gene expression, primers were de-
signed so that excision of the resistance cassette with the FLP
recombinase would create an in-frame deletion of the
respective chromosomal gene (Figure 3). Primer sequences
were based on the highly accurate E. coli K-12 genome
(Hayashi et al, 2006), in which the majority of the corrections
to coding regions and start codon re-assignments had been
made in accordance with the November 2003 E. coli K-12
annotation workshop (Riley et al, 2006).
The targeting PCR products were designed to create in-frame
deletions of the 2nd through the 7th codon from the C-
terminus, leaving the ORF start codon and translational signal

Primer design and construction of single-gene deletion mutants. Gene knockout primers have 20-nt 30 ends for priming upstream (P1) and downstream (P2)
of the FRT sites ﬂanking the kanamycin resistance gene in pKD13 and 50-nt 50 ends homologous to upstream (H1) and downstream (H2) chromosomal sequences for
targeting the gene deletion (Supplementary Table 2). H1 includes the gene B (target) initiation codon. H2 includes codons for the six C-terminal residues, the stop codon,
and 29-nt downstream. The same primer design with respect to gene B was used to target deletions regardless of whether gene B lies in an operon with genes A and C,
as shown, or in different chromosomal arrangements. Novel junctions created between the resistance cassette and neighboring upstream (gene A) and downstream
(gene C) sequences were veriﬁed by PCR with kanamycin (k1 or k2) and locus-speciﬁc (U or D) primers. Structures created after excision of the resistance gene are
veriﬁed by PCR with neighboring gene-speciﬁc primers and by direct DNA sequencing of the region encompassing the H1-P1-FRT-P2-H2 scar to verify correct ones, as
described elsewhere (Datsenko and Wanner, 2000). SD, Shine–Dalgarno ribosome binding sequence.

for a downstream gene intact (Figure 2). However, according
to its latest genome annotation, E. coli K-12 has 742 over-
lapping genes, ranging in length from 1 to 260 nt, with the
longest being for ytfPand yzfA. Although the majority are short
(1–8 nt), 191 genes overlap by at least 9 nt. Thus, our standard
design for construction of in-frame deletions can in some cases
simultaneously affect the coding of two overlapping ORFs,
which can be especially important when evaluating gene
essentiality.
For example, folC encodes bifunctional folylpolyglutamate
and dihydrofolate synthases and has an 11-nt overlap with the
downstream dedD, encoding a conserved protein of unknown
function. In agreement with an earlier study (Pyne and Bognar,
1992), we found folC to be essential (on the basis of the criteria
below). Preliminary results suggested that dedD was also
essential. However, due to the folC-dedD gene overlap, it was
conceivable that the lethality of a dedD deletion was due to
alteration of the folC C-terminus. To address these kinds of
issues, a small number of primers were redesigned to avoid
altering two genes simultaneously, by taking into account gene
overlaps. Indeed, dedD was successfully deleted with a PCR
product that was synthesized with an N-terminal primer that
was redesigned to prevent altering the folC coding region.
Primer extensions are given in Supplementary Table 2.
Construction and veriﬁcation of deletion mutants
Our standard protocol usually yielded 10–1000 KmR colonies
when cells were incubated aerobically at 371C on Luria broth
(LB) agar containing 30 mg/ml kanamycin. The most critical
step was preparation of highly electrocompetent cells (4109
transformants per 1 mg of plasmid DNA under standard
conditions). Mutants were isolated in batches, in which each
batch included a PCR product for disruption of ydhQ as a
positive control as well as a no PCR product negative control.
The latter usually gave only 10–100 tiny colonies. From every
gene deletion experiment, four or eight KmR colonies were
chosen and checked for ones with the correct structure by PCR
using a combination of locus- and kanamycin-speciﬁc primers
(Figure 2), as described elsewhere (Datsenko and Wanner,
2000). Mutants were scored as correct if two or more colonies
had the expected structure based on PCR tests for both
junction fragments.
Keio collection deletions
Of 4288 genes targeted, deletions were obtained for 3985 ORFs
(Supplementary Table 3). Based on ﬁnding mutants with the
predicted structure, these 3985 genes are (probably) nones-
sential, while the 303 genes (including 37 genes of unknown
function), for which no mutants were found, are candidates for
essential genes (Figure 4; Table I). Our ORF deletions include
3912 genes annotated in both E. coli K-12 MG1655 and W3110
and 73 previously annotated genes (Supplementary Table 4).
The 3912 composite
K-12
ORF deletions include
2157
characterized genes and 1755 genes of uncharacterized or
unknown function. ORFs not targeted include 79 IS genes, four
genes for small toxic polypeptides (ldrA, ldrB, ldrC, and ldrD),
and seven genes already disrupted in BW25113 (araBAD, lacZ,
and rhaBAD; Datsenko and Wanner, 2000). No in-frame
deletion was targeted to 12 ORFs whose coding region was
changed at the March 2005 annotation workshop (Riley et al,
2006) after completion of the Keio collection (Supplementary
Table 5). RNA genes were also not targeted.
Evaluation of gene essentiality
Several causes can contribute to ﬁnding too many or too few
nonessential genes. One way to evaluate gene essentiality is to
examine our knockout efﬁciency (Table II), that is, the percent
of the KmR colonies with the correct structure. For nearly 50%
of the targeted ORFs, all KmR colonies had the expected

structure for the correct deletion; for 93% of the ORFs, at least
50% were correct; and, with one exception, for all Keio
mutants, at least 25% were correct. The exceptional case,
secM, has a translational arrest sequence within its C-terminus
that is required for expression of the downstream secA,
encoding an essential preprotein translocase SecA subunit
(Murakami et al, 2004; Nakatogawa et al, 2005). Thus, it is
reasonable to suggest that the sole secM mutant arose because
it acquired a suppressor allowing secA expression. Essential
gene candidates are given in Supplementary Table 6.
The ability to select directly for knockout mutants may have
led to other mutants with suppressors. For example, the same
mutagenesis strategy has been used elsewhere to create a
deletion of mreB (Kruse et al, 2003), an essential gene, in
which case, the mutant was later shown to carry a suppressor
(Kruse et al, 2005). Yet, we repeatedly failed to recover a
DmreB mutant, even when using the identical primers and
host. We also conﬁrmed the absence of mreB coding sequences
in their DmreB mutant, thus ruling out the possibility of a
duplicate mreB sequence (data not shown). Clearly, secM and
mreB are examples of ‘quasi-essential’ genes, for suppressors
allow viability of mutants with the respective deletions.
By deﬁnition, deletions of truly essential genes cannot be
mutationally suppressed.
In addition to suppressors, a functional redundancy or
duplication can hide gene essentiality. It is difﬁcult to assess
functional redundancy without further experimentation. How-
ever, gene duplications can explain why we recovered mutants
with deletions of some genes, like ileS and glyS, encoding
isoleucyl-tRNA and glycine (b-subunit) tRNA synthetases,
which are essential. In these cases, the mutants carry intact
copies of the respective deleted gene elsewhere (R D’Ari and
K Nakahihashi, personal communication), presumably result-
ing from gene duplications. Nevertheless, because the vast
majority of mutants were recovered at a high frequency
(Table II), neither suppressors nor duplications seem to be
major concerns. Genetic duplications resulting from gene
ampliﬁcation have been well documented in bacteria; however,
the frequency is low; under ordinary conditions, about one in
400 genes is on average duplicated in a culture (Anderson and
Roth, 1977). If we assume similar values, then no more than
about 10 of our mutants is likely to have a gene duplication.
Even though about 1.5% of the yeast mutants were eliminated
due to duplications (Giaever et al, 2002), most studies on gene
essentiality fail to consider this issue.
Special cases
A few discrepancies exist between our results and those of
earlier studies. For example, we were able to delete hlpA,
encoding a periplasmic chaperone for outer membrane
proteins, which had been reported to be essential (Dicker
and Seetharam, 1992). This can be explained by the location of
hlpA immediately upstream of lpxD, encoding an essential
UDP-3-O-(3-hydroxymyristoyl)-glucosamine
N-acyltransfer-
ase. A polar effect of the hlpA disruption on lpxD expression
was likely responsible for the earlier evidence of gene
essentiality. Mutants described here are initially nonpolar
because downstream genes can be expressed from the
resistance gene promoter (Figure 2), and from the upstream
native promoter upon elimination of the resistance cassette.
A number of factors can cause a nonessential gene to appear
to be essential. The absence of diaminopimelic acid from
standard laboratory media is surely why no mutants requiring
this supplement (dapA, B, or E) were recovered. Likewise, our
inability to recover particular mutants in central metabolic
pathways, for example, gapA, is due to our use of media on
which mutants lacking (nonessential) glycolysis genes fail to
grow (Fraenkel, 1996), which can be due to the accumulation
of toxic intermediates.
Occasional technical problems can also interfere with the
isolation of deletions. In a few instances, PCR products failed
to target a gene due to the presence of IS elements at sites that
were previously unrecognized. Such deletions were success-
fully made when the primer(s) was redesigned to take the IS
element into account. Primer quality is also important. In rare
cases, we failed to isolate a deletion for no apparent
explanation, yet we were able to do so with a new batch of
primers.
Toxin–antitoxin (TA) systems
Deletion of a single gene can lead to aberrant behavior in
certain gene contexts. Well-studied examples are the prokar-

yotic TA stress response loci (Gerdes et al, 2005). For example,
RelE and MazF are toxins that cleave mRNA in response to
a nutritional stress. Under nonstress conditions, a speciﬁc
antitoxin (RelB or MazE) prevents cleavage, allowing normal
growth. E. coli K-12 encodes six such TA systems, three
belonging to the RelE (toxin)/RelB (antitoxin) family, RelE/
RelB, YafQ/DinJ, and YoeB/YefM; two belonging to the
MazF/MazE family, ChpA(MazF)/ChpR(MazE) and ChpB/
ChpS; and one belonging to the TA-like system, HipA/HipB.
Our failure to ﬁnd deletions of yefM, chpR, or chpS is likely
because they encode TA system antitoxins.
Categories of essential genes
ORFs can be classiﬁed into clusters of orthologous groups
(COGs) belonging to different functional categories (Figure 5;
Supplementary Table 7). It is natural for multidomain proteins
to be comprised of more than one COG. Some COGs also
belong to more than one functional class. Consequently, the
4390 ORFs in E. coli K-12 strain W3110 correspond to 4011
COGs (and 1214 with no COG assignment), while the 303
essential ORF candidates correspond to 315 COGs (and 26 with
no COG assignment). The fraction of essential genes varies
widely with the COG classiﬁcation. The greatest fractions are
for COGs with roles in translation, ribosomal structure, and
biogenesis. The vast majority of essential genes belong to
COGs with roles in cell division, lipid metabolism, translation,
transcription, and cell envelope biogenesis. For example, our
results showed that rpoE and rpoH, encoding RNA polymerase
heat-shock sigma factors E and H, respectively, are essential, in
agreement with earlier studies (Zhou et al, 1988; Hiratsu et al,
1995). Our data also showed that we were able to disrupt genes
for ﬁve ribosomal proteins (S6, S20, L1, L11, and L33), which
had been previously shown to be nonessential (Dabbs, 1991).
Discrepancies for 11 others may have resulted from use of
different growth conditions or strain.
Comparison with other E. coli gene essentiality studies
Genetic footprinting (Gerdes et al, 2003; Tong et al, 2004)
revealed 620 genes to be essential for robust aerobic growth of
E. coli K-12. Yet, only 67% (205 genes) overlap with the
predicted essential genes in this study. Striking differences can
be attributed to the use of different mutagenesis strategies
(transposon insertion versus deletion), different growth
conditions (broth versus agar), or the approach for discrimi-
nating essential versus nonessential genes. Because genetic
footprinting measures cell populations, a mutation causing
slow growth can lead to under-representation of the mutant
and hence false classiﬁcation of many genes as essential. In
contrast, we sought deletion mutants as survivors without
regard to growth rate. Supplementary Table 6 has a compar-
ison of our results with those from genetic footprinting (Gerdes
et al, 2003), the PEC database (Hashimoto et al, 2005), and
transposon mutagenesis (Kang et al, 2004), in which an
‘essentiality score’ is computed for all 303 essential gene
candidates from our study.

We also examined the conservation of the K-12 essential
genes in genomes of other organisms in the Microbial Genome
Database
(http://mbgd.genome.ad.jp/;
Uchiyama,
2003).
Comparison with three other E. coli genomes revealed that
more than 90% (282) of the essential genes are universally
present. About one-half (147) are conserved among 20 different
Enterobacteriaceae genomes. One-third (85) are conserved
among 74 Proteobacteria and less than 15% (42) are conserved
among 171 bacteria (Supplementary Tables 6 and 8).
Comparison with gene essentiality in other free-living
bacteria
B. subtilis has a 4.2-Mb genome and 271 essential genes
(Kobayashi et
al, 2003).
About
one-half
(150)
of the
orthologous genes are also essential in E. coli. Another 67
genes that are essential in E. coli are not essential in B. subtilis,
while 86 E. coli essential genes have no B. subtilis ortholog.
Details are given in Supplementary Table 6.
Proﬁling contributions of individual genes during
growth on rich and minimal media
All mutants were proﬁled for growth yield in both rich (LB)
and minimal glucose MOPS media (Figure 6). Growth data in
Figure 6 are summarized according to COG category in Table
III. Complete information is in Supplementary Table 3. Many
factors can contribute to how efﬁciently cells convert nutrients
into biomass. The vast majority showed no differences from
wild type. Mutants in circled area 1 gave higher yield in
minimal than rich; those in area 2 gave similar yields in both
media; and those in area 3 gave higher yields in rich than
minimal. No correlation with mutant class was seen for those
in areas 1 or 2. As expected, the majority in area 3 has defects in
biosynthesis, for example, for amino acids, purines, pyrimi-
dines, and vitamins. Curiously, a subset of these auxotrophs
showed modest growth after 48 h, suggesting that suppressors
arose. The trivial explanation of crosscontamination is unlikely
because similar results were obtained in replica cultures. A few
mutants with deletions of genes of unknown function also grew
well in rich but not in minimal, which may provide a handle
on determination of their function. Some grew after 24 h but
showed no growth after 48 h, suggesting lysis, for example,
ddlB (D-alanine:D-alanine ligase), csgC (predicted curli produc-
tion protein), rsxC (predicted 4Fe–4S ferredoxin-type protein),
and others. Many grew poorly on both rich and minimal media,
for example, priA (primosome factor), atp (ATP synthase
components), and cyaA (adenylate cyclase). Nevertheless, the
majority showed no striking growth defect.

worldwide. Distribution is being handled via GenoBase
(http://ecoli.aist-nara.ac.jp/) together with supporting data
and other key resources, including the ASKA (A complete Set
of E. coli K-12 ORF Archive) clone sets (Kitagawa et al, 2005).
Several studies have already reported use of these mutants. For
example, single-gene deletion mutants of the Keio collection
were utilized for the study of uncharacterized gene function
(Melnick et al, 2004) and the analysis of metabolism (Jiao et al,
2003; Hua et al, 2003, 2004; Yang et al, 2003; Zhao et al,
2004a, b). The use of subsets of Keio collection mutants has
substantiated the value of systematical approaches for the
understanding of cellular systems (Tenorio et al, 2003; Ito et al,
2005; Perrenoud and Sauer, 2005).
Summary
We have undertaken a large-scale project for systematic
construction of a set of precisely deﬁned single-gene, knockout
mutants of all nonessential genes in E. coli K-12. These
mutants were designed to create in-frame (nonpolar) deletions
upon elimination of the resistance cassette. Our analysis of
these mutants has provided new key information on E. coli
biology. First, the vast majority of the genes that were
independently disrupted at least twice are probably nones-
sential, at least under the conditions of selection. Second,
those genes that we repeatedly failed to disrupt are candidates
for essential E. coli genes. Lastly, by comparing the effects of
these mutations in the same E. coli K-12 genetic background,
we proﬁled the contribution of these genes to growth on
synthetic minimal and rich medium.
The Keio collection should provide not only a basic resource
for systematic functional genomics but also experimental
data source for systems biology approaches. The mutants can
serve as fundamental tools for a number of reverse genetics
approaches, permitting analysis of the consequences of the
complete loss of gene function, in contrast to forward genetics
approaches in which mutant phenotypes are associated
with a corresponding gene(s). By providing this resource to
the research community, the authors hope to contribute to
worldwide efforts directed towards a comprehensive under-
standing of the E. coli K-12 model cell. Because many E. coli
gene products are well conserved in nature, the Keio collection
is likely to be useful not only for studying E. coli and other
bacteria but also for examining properties of genes from a wide
range of living organisms.

Media, chemicals, and other reagents
Cells were routinely grown in LB medium containing 1% Bacto
Tryptone (Difco), 0.5% yeast extract (Difco), and 0.5% NaCl with or
without antibiotics at 50 mg/ml for ampicillin (Wako, Osaka, Japan)
and 30 mg/ml for kanamycin (Wako, Osaka, Japan). Glucose,
L-arabinose, and other chemicals were from Wako (Osaka, Japan).
DpnI was from New England Biolabs (MA, USA); Taq polymerase,
TaKaRa Ex Taq, and agarose, SeaKem GTG Agarose from Takara Shuzo
Inc. E-Gel 96 systems were from Invitrogen. MOPS medium was
prepared as described elsewhere (Wanner, 1994).
PCR primers
With a few exceptions, N-terminal deletion primers had a 50-nt 50
extension including the gene initiation codon (H1) and the 20-nt
sequence 50-ATTCCGGGGATCCGTCGACC-30
(P1), and C-terminal
deletion primers consisted of 21 nt for the C-terminal region, the
termination codon and 29-nt downstream (H2), and the 20-nt
sequence 50-TGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTCG-30 (P2; Figure 2). All exten-
sions are in given Supplementary Table 2.
Generation of PCR fragments
PCR reactions were carried out in 96-well microplates in 50 ml reactions
containing 2.5 U of TaKaRa Ex Taq polymerase, 1 pg pKD13 DNA, 1.0mM
of each primer, and 200mM dNTPs. Reactions were run for 30 cycles:
941C for 30 s, 591C for 30 s, 721C for 2 min, plus an additional 2 min at
721C. PCR products were digested with DpnI, ethanol precipitated,
resuspended in 6 ml H2O, and analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophor-
esis using 0.5  Tris-acetate buffer or the E-Gel 96 system.
Electroporation and mutant selection
E. coli K-12 BW25113 carrying the Red helper plasmid pKD46 was
grown in 100 ml SOB medium with ampicillin and 1 mM L-arabinose at
301C to an OD600 of 0.3, and electroporation-competent cells were
prepared as described elsewhere (Sambrook et al, 1998). A measure of
50 ml of competent cells was mixed with 400 ng of the PCR fragment in
an ice-cold 0.2 cm cuvette (Bio-Rad Inc.). Cells were electroporated at
2.5 kV with 25 mF and 200 O, immediately followed by the addition of
1 ml of SOC medium (2% Bacto Tryptone (Difco), 0.5% yeast extract
(Difco), 10 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM MgSO4,
20 mM glucose) with 1 mM L-arabinose. After incubation for 2 h at
371C, one-tenth portion was spread onto agar plate to select KmR
transformants at 371C.
PCR veriﬁcation of deletions
Two PCR reactions were carried out to test for correct chromosomal
structures. Eight independent colonies were transferred into 150-ml LB
medium with kanamycin in 96-well microplates and incubated
overnight at 371C without shaking. A measure of 1 ml of each culture
was separately examined in 20-ml PCR reactions following 2-min ‘hot
start’ at 951C. PCRveriﬁcation with kanamycin-speciﬁc primers k1 and
k2 and locus-speciﬁc primers U and D (Figure 2) was carried out as
described previously (Datsenko and Wanner, 2000). PCR products
were analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis as above.
Storage of mutants
Mutants were stored at 801C in 96-well microplates containing 150-ml
LB medium with kanamycin and 15% glycerol.
Growth tests
Mutants were tested for growth in 200-ml LB medium with kanamycin
as a rich medium in 96-well microplates inoculated directly with
96 inoculation pins (Genetix Limited, UK) and incubated for 22 h
at 371C without shaking. Absorbance at 600 nm was measured
after mixing for 5 s in a 96-well plate reader (Molecular Dynamics).
Mutants were transferred with 96-inoculation pins (Genetix Limited,
UK) from LB into 200-ml 0.4% glucose MOPS medium with 2 mM Pi
(Wanner, 1994) and kanamycin as minimal medium and incubated
for 24 and 48 h at 371C without shaking. Absorbances were similarly
measured.
