Multiple sequence alignments are fundamental to many sequence analysis methods. Most
alignments are computed using the progressive alignment heuristic. These methods are starting
to become a bottleneck in some analysis pipelines when faced with data sets of the size of many
thousands of sequences. Some methods allow computation of larger data sets while sacriﬁcing
quality, and others produce high-quality alignments, but scale badly with the number of sequences.
In this paper, we describe a new program called Clustal Omega, which can align virtually
any number of protein sequences quickly and that delivers accurate alignments. The accuracy
of the package on smaller test cases is similar to that of the high-quality aligners. On larger data
sets, Clustal Omega outperforms other packages in terms of execution time and quality.
Clustal Omega also has powerful features for adding sequences to and exploiting information in
existing alignments, making use of the vast amount of precomputed information in public databases
like Pfam.

Introduction
Multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) are essential in most
bioinformatics analyses that involve comparing homologous
sequences. The exact way of computing an optimal alignment
between N sequences has a computational complexity of
O(LN) for N sequences of length L making it prohibitive for
even small numbers of sequences. Most automatic methods
are based on the ‘progressive alignment’ heuristic (Hogeweg
and Hesper, 1984), which aligns sequences in larger and larger
subalignments, following the branching order in a ‘guide tree.’
With a complexity of roughly O(N2), this approach can
routinely make alignments of a few thousand sequences of
moderate length, but it is tough to make alignments much
bigger than this. The progressive approach is a ‘greedy
algorithm’ where mistakes made at the initial alignment
stages cannot be corrected later. To counteract this effect, the
consistency principle was developed (Notredame et al, 2000).
This has allowed the production of a new generation of more
accurate aligners (e.g. T-Coffee (Notredame et al, 2000)) but
at the expense of ease of computation. These methods give
5–10% more accurate alignments, as measured on benchmarks,
but are conﬁned to a few hundred sequences.
In this report, we introduce a new program called Clustal
Omega, which is accurate but also allows alignments of almost
any size to be produced. We have used it to generate
alignments of over 190 000 sequences on a single processor
in a few hours. In benchmark tests, it is distinctly more
accurate than most widely used, fast methods and comparable
in accuracy to some of the intensive slow methods. It also has
powerful features for allowing users to reuse their alignments
so as to avoid recomputing an entire alignment, every time
new sequences become available.
The key to making the progressive alignment approach scale
is the method used to make the guide tree. Normally, this
involves aligning all N sequences to each other giving time and
memory requirements of O(N2). Protein families with 450 000
sequences are appearing and will become common from
various wide scale genome sequencing projects. Currently, the
only method that can routinely make alignments of more than

about 10 000 sequences is MAFFT/PartTree (Katoh and Toh,
2007). It is very fast but leads to a loss in accuracy, which has
to be compensated for by iteration and other heuristics. With
Clustal Omega, we use a modiﬁed version of mBed (Black-
shields et al, 2010), which has complexity of O(N log N), and
which produces guide trees that are just as accurate as those
from conventional methods. mBed works by ‘emBedding’ each
sequence in a space of n dimensions where n is proportional to
log N. Each sequence is then replaced by an n element vector,
where each element is simply the distance to one of n ‘reference
sequences.’ These vectors can then be clustered extremely
quickly by standard methods such as K-means or UPGMA.
In Clustal Omega, the alignments are then computed using the
very accurate HHalign package (So¨ding, 2005), which aligns
two proﬁle hidden Markov models (Eddy, 1998).
Clustal Omega has a number of features for adding
sequences to existing alignments or for using existing
alignments to help align new sequences. One innovation is
to allow users to specify a proﬁle HMM that is derived from an
alignment of sequences that are homologous to the input set.
The sequences are then aligned to these ‘external proﬁles’ to
help align them to the rest of the input set. There are already
widely available collections of HMMs from many sources such
as Pfam (Finn et al, 2009) and these can now be used to help
users to align their sequences.
Results
Alignment accuracy
The standard method for measuring the accuracy of multiple
alignment algorithms is to use benchmark test sets of reference
alignments, generated with reference to three-dimensional
structures. Here, we present results from a range of packages
tested on three benchmarks: BAliBASE (Thompson et al,
2005), Prefab (Edgar, 2004) and an extended version of
HomFam (Blackshields et al, 2010). For these tests, we just
report results using the default settings for all programs but
with two exceptions, which were needed to allow MUSCLE
(Edgar, 2004) and MAFFT to align the biggest test cases in
HomFam. For test cases with 43000 sequences, we run
MUSCLE with the –maxiter parameter set to 2, in order to ﬁnish
the alignments in reasonable times. Second, we have run several
different programs from the MAFFT package. MAFFT (Katoh
et al, 2002) consists of a series of programs that can be run
separately or called automatically from a script with the –auto
ﬂag set. This ﬂag chooses to run a slow, consistency-based
program (L-INS-i) when the number and lengths of sequences is
small. When the numbers exceed inbuilt thresholds, a conven-
tional progressive aligner is used (FFT-NS-2). The latter is also the
program that is run by default if MAFFT is called with no ﬂags
set. For very large data sets, the –parttree ﬂag must be set on the
command line and a very fast guide tree calculation is then used.
The results for the BAliBASE benchmark tests are shown in
Table I. BAliBASE is divided into six ‘references.’Average scores
are given for each reference, along with total run times and
average total column (TC) scores, which give the proportion of
the total alignment columns that is recovered. A score of 1.0
indicates perfect agreement with the benchmark. There are two
rows for the MAFFT package: MAFFT (auto) and MAFFT
default. In most (203 out of 218) BAliBASE test cases, the
number of sequences is small and the script runs L-INS-i, which
is the slow accurate program that uses the consistency heuristic
(Notredame et al, 2000) that is also used by MSAprobs
(Liu et al, 2010), Probalign, Probcons (Do et al, 2005) and
T-Coffee. These programs are all restricted to small numbers of
sequences but tend to give accurate alignments. This is clearly
reﬂected in the times and average scores in Table I. The times
range from 25 min up to 22 h for these packages and the
accuracies range from 55 to 61% of columns correct. Clustal
Omega only takes 9 min for the same runs but has an accuracy
level that is similar to that of Probcons and T-Coffee.
The rest of the table is mainly taken by the programs that use
progressive alignment. Some of these are very fast but this
speed is matched by a considerable drop in accuracy compared
with the consistency-based programs and Clustal Omega. The
weakest program here, is Clustal W (Larkin et al, 2007)
followed by PRANK (Lo¨ytynoja and Goldman, 2008). PRANK
is not designed for aligning distantly related sequences but at
giving good alignments for phylogenetic work with special

attention to gaps. These gap positions are not included in these
tests as they tend not to be structurally conserved. Dialign
(Morgenstern et al, 1998) does not use consistency or
progressive alignment but is based on ﬁnding best local multiple
alignments. FSA (Bradley et al, 2009) uses sampling of pairwise
alignments and ‘sequence annealing’ and has been shown to
deliver good nucleotide sequence alignments in the past.
The Prefab benchmark test results are shown in Table II.
Here, the results are divided into ﬁve groups according to the
percent identity of the sequences. The overall scores range
from 53 to 73% of columns correct. The consistency-based
programs MSAprobs, MAFFT L-INS-i, Probalign, Probcons and
T-Coffee, are again the most accurate but with long run times.
Clustal Omega is close to the consistency programs in accuracy
but is much faster. There is then a gap to the faster progressive
based programs of MUSCLE, MAFFT, Kalign (Lassmann and
Sonnhammer, 2005) and Clustal W.
Results from testing large alignments with up to 50 000
sequences are given in Table III using HomFam. Here, each
alignment is made up of a core of a Homstrad (Mizuguchi et al,
1998) structure-based alignment of at least ﬁve sequences. These
sequences are then inserted into a test set of sequences from the
corresponding, homologous, Pfam domain. This gives very large
sets of sequences to be aligned but the testing is only carried out
on the sequences with known structures. Only some programs
are able to deliver alignments at all, with data sets of this size. We
restricted the comparisons to Clustal Omega, MAFFT, MUSCLE
and Kalign. MAFFT with default settings, has a limit of 20 000
sequences and we only use MAFFT with –parttree for the last
section of Table III. MUSCLE becomes increasingly slow when
you get over 3000 sequences. Therefore, for 43000 sequences
we used MUSCLE with the faster but less accurate setting of –
maxiters 2, which restricts the number of iterations to two.
Overall, Clustal Omega is easily the most accurate program
in Table III. The run times show MAFFT default and Kalign
to be exceptionally fast on the smaller test cases and MAFFT
–parttree to be very fast on the biggest families. Clustal
Omega does scale well, however, with increasing numbers of
sequences. This scaling is described in more detail in the
Supplementary Information. We do have two further test cases
with 450 000 sequences, but it was not possible to get results
for these from MUSCLE or Kalign. These are described in the
Supplementary Information as well.
Table III gives overall run times for the four programs
evaluated with HomFam. Figure 1 resolves these run times
case by case. Kalign is very fast for small families but does not
scale as well. Overall, MAFFT is faster than the other programs
over all test case sizes but Clustal Omega scales similarly.
Points in Figure 1 represent different families with different
average sequence lengths and pairwise identities. Therefore,
the scalability trend is fuzzy, with larger dots occurring
generally above smaller dots. Supplementary Figure S3 shows
scalability data, where subsets of increasing size are sampled
from one large family only. This reduces variability in pairwise
identity and sequence length.
External proﬁle alignment
Clustal Omega can read extra information from a proﬁle HMM
derived from preexisting alignments. For example, if a user

wishes to align a set of globin sequences and has an existing
globin alignment, this alignment can be converted to a proﬁle
HMM and used as well as the sequence input ﬁle. This HMM is
here referred to as an ‘external proﬁle’ and its use in this way
as ‘external proﬁle alignment’ (EPA). During EPA, each
sequence in the input set is aligned to the external proﬁle.
Pseudocount information from the external proﬁle is then
transferred, position by position, to the input sequence.
Ideally, this would be used with large curated alignments of
particular proteins or domains of interest such as are used in
metagenomics projects. Rather than taking the input se-
quences and aligning them from scratch, every time new
sequences are found, the alignment should be carefully
maintained and used as an external proﬁle for EPA. Clustal
Omega also can align sequences to existing alignments using
conventional alignment methods. Users can add sequences to
an alignment, one by one or align a set of aligned sequences to
the alignment.
In this paper, we demonstrate the EPA approach with two
examples. First, we take the 94 HomFam test cases from the
previous section and use the corresponding Pfam HMM for
EPA. Before EPA, the average accuracy for the test cases was
0.627 of correctly aligned Homstrad positions but after EPA it
rises to 0.653. This is plotted, test case for test case in
Figure 2A. Each dot is one test case with the TC score for
Clustal Omega plotted against the score using EPA. The second
example is illustrated in Figure 2B. Here, we take all the
BAliBASE reference sets and align them as normal using
Clustal Omega and obtain the benchmark result of 0.554 of
columns correctly aligned, as already reported in Table I. For
EPA, we use the benchmark reference alignments themselves
as external proﬁles. The results now jump to 0.857 of columns
correct. This is a jump of over 30% and while it is not a valid
measure of Clustal Omega accuracy for comparison with other
programs, it does illustrate the potential power of EPA to use
information in external alignments.
Iteration
EPA can also be used in a simple iteration scheme. Once a MSA
has been made from a set of input sequences, it can be
converted into a HMM and used for EPA to help realign the
input sequences. This can also be combined with a full
recalculation of the guide tree. In Figure 3, we show the results
of one and two iterations on every test case from HomFam.
The graph is plotted as a running average TC score for all test
cases with N or fewer test cases where N is plotted on the
horizontal axis using a log scale. With some smaller test cases,
iteration actually has a detrimental effect. Once you get near
1000 or more sequences, however, a clear trend emerges.
The more sequences you have, the more beneﬁcial the effect of
iteration is. With bigger test cases, it becomes more and more
beneﬁcial to apply two iterations. This result conﬁrms
the usefulness of EPA as a general strategy. It also conﬁrms
the difﬁculty in aligning extremely large numbers of sequences
but gives one partial solution. It also gives a very simple but
effective iteration scheme, not just for guide tree iteration, as
used in many packages, but for iteration of the alignment itself.
Discussion
The main breakthroughs since the mid 1980s in MSA methods
have been progressive alignment and the use of consistency.
Otherwise, most recent work has concerned reﬁnements for
speed or accuracy on benchmark test sets. The speed increases
have been dramatic but, with just two major exceptions, the
methods are still basically O(N2) and incapable of being
extended to data sets of 410 000 sequences. The two
exceptions are mBed, used here, and MAFFT PartTree. PartTree
is faster but at the expense of accuracy, at least as judged by the
benchmarking here. The second group of recent developments

have concerned accuracy. This has tended to focus on results
from benchmarking, a potentially contentious issue (Aniba
et al, 2010; Edgar, 2010). The benchmark test sets that we have
are limited in scope and heavily biased toward single domain
globular proteins. This has the potential to lead to methods
that behave well on benchmarks but which are not so ﬂexible
or useful in real-world situations. One development to improve
accuracy has been the recruitment of extra homologs to
bulk up input data sets. This seems to work well with the
consistency-based methods and for small data sets. It appears,
however, that there is a limit to the extra accuracy that can be
obtained this way, without further development. The extra
sequences may also bring in noise and dramatically increase
the complexity of the computational problem. This can be
partly ﬁxed by iteration but, EPA to a high-quality reference
alignment might be a better solution. This also raises the need
for methods to visualize such large alignments, in order to
detect problems. A second major focus for development has
been the use of external information such as RNA structure
(Wilm et al, 2008) or protein structure predictions (Pirovano
et al, 2008).
EPA is a new approach that allows users to exploit
information in their own or in publicly available alignments.
It does not force new sequences to follow the older alignment
exactly. The new sequences get aligned to each other using
progressive alignment but the information in the external
proﬁle can help provide information as to which amino
acids are most likely to occur at each position in a sequence.
Most methods attempt to predict this from general models of
protein evolution with secondary structure prediction as a
reﬁnement. In this paper, we have shown that even using
the mass produced alignments from Pfam as external proﬁles
provides a small increase in accuracy for a large general set of
test cases. This opens up a new set of possibilities for users to
make use of the information contained in large, publicly
available alignments and creates an incentive for database
providers to make very high-quality alignments available.
One of the reasons for the great success of Clustal X was
the very user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). This,
however, is not as critical as in the past due to the widespread
availability of web-based services where the GUI is provided
by the web-based front-end server. Further, there are several
very high-quality alignment viewers and editors such as
Jalview (Clamp et al, 2004) and Seaview (Gouy et al, 2010) that
read Clustal Omega output or which can call Clustal Omega
directly.

accepts ClustalW-style command options for backwards compatibility
and easy integration into existing pipelines.
Clustal Omega is written in C and C þ þ and makes use of a number
of excellent free software packages. We used a modiﬁed version of
Figure 2
EPA for HomFam and BAliBASE. Points represent TC scores of Clustal Omega alignment with EPA versus TC scores of default Clustal Omega alignment
(without EPA). Points above bisectrix represent beneﬁcial effect of EPA, points below deleterious effect. Average improvement in (A) 2.5%. HMMs taken from Pfam,
benchmarking carried out using corresponding structure-based alignment in Homstrad. Average improvement in (B) over 30%. Here, test sets and EPA-HMMs were
both derived from BAliBASE reference alignments.

Sean Eddy’s Squid library (http://selab.janelia.org/software.html) for
sequence I/O, allowing the use of a wide variety of ﬁle formats. We use
David Arthur’s k-means þ þ code (Arthur and Vassilvitskii, 2007) for
fast clustering of sequence vectors. Code for fast UPGMA and guide
tree handling routines was adopted from MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004).
We use the OpenMP library to enable multithreaded computation of
pairwise distances and alignment match states. The documentation
for Clustal Omega’s API is part of the source code, and in addition
is available from http://www.clustal.org/omega/clustalo-api/. Full
details of all algorithms are given in the accompanying Supplementary
Information.
The benchmarks that were used were BAliBASE 3 (Thompson et al,
2005), PREFAB 4.0 (posted March 2005) (Edgar, 2010) and a newly
constructed data set (HomFam) using sequences from Pfam (version
25) and Homstrad (as of 2011-06-13) (Mizuguchi et al, 1998). The
programs that were compared can be obtained from:
