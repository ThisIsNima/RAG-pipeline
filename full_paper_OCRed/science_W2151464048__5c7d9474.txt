The sequence of the mouse genome is a key informational tool for understanding the contents of the human genome and a key
experimental tool for biomedical research. Here, we report the results of an international collaboration to produce a high-quality
draft sequence of the mouse genome. We also present an initial comparative analysis of the mouse and human genomes,
describing some of the insights that can be gleaned from the two sequences. We discuss topics including the analysis of the
evolutionary forces shaping the size, structure and sequence of the genomes; the conservation of large-scale synteny across most
of the genomes; the much lower extent of sequence orthology covering less than half of the genomes; the proportions of the
genomes under selection; the number of protein-coding genes; the expansion of gene families related to reproduction and
immunity; the evolution of proteins; and the identiﬁcation of intraspecies polymorphism.
With the complete sequence of the human genome nearly in hand1,2,
the next challenge is to extract the extraordinary trove of infor-
mation encoded within its roughly 3 billion nucleotides. This
information includes the blueprints for all RNAs and proteins,
the regulatory elements that ensure proper expression of all genes,
the structural elements that govern chromosome function, and the
records of our evolutionary history. Some of these features can be
recognized easily in the human sequence, but many are subtle and
difﬁcult to discern. One of the most powerful general approaches
for unlocking the secrets of the human genome is comparative
genomics, and one of the most powerful starting points for
comparison is the laboratory mouse, Mus musculus.
Metaphorically, comparative genomics allows one to read evolu-
tion’s laboratory notebook. In the roughly 75 million years since the
divergence of the human and mouse lineages, the process of
evolution has altered their genome sequences and caused them to
diverge by nearly one substitution for every two nucleotides (see
below) as well as by deletion and insertion. The divergence rate is
low enough that one can still align orthologous sequences, but high
enough so that one can recognize many functionally important
elements by their greater degree of conservation. Studies of small
genomic regions have demonstrated the power of such cross-species
conservation to identify putative genes or regulatory elements3–12.
Genome-wide analysis of sequence conservation holds the prospect
of systematically revealing such information for all genes. Genome-
wide comparisons among organisms can also highlight key differ-
ences in the forces shaping their genomes, including differences in
mutational and selective pressures13,14.
Literally, comparative genomics allows one to link laboratory
notebooks of clinical and basic researchers. With knowledge of both
genomes, biomedical studies of human genes can be complemented
by experimental manipulations of corresponding mouse genes to
accelerate functional understanding. In this respect, the mouse is
unsurpassed as a model system for probing mammalian biology and
human disease15,16. Its unique advantages include a century of
genetic studies, scores of inbred strains, hundreds of spontaneous
mutations, practical techniques for random mutagenesis, and,
importantly, directed engineering of the genome through trans-
genic, knockout and knockin techniques17–22.
For these and other reasons, the Human Genome Project (HGP)
recognized from its outset that the sequencing of the human
genome needed to be followed as rapidly as possible by the
sequencing of the mouse genome. In early 2001, the International
Human Genome Sequencing Consortium reported a draft sequence
covering about 90% of the euchromatic human genome, with about
35% in ﬁnished form1. Since then, progress towards a complete
human sequence has proceeded swiftly, with approximately 98% of
the genome now available in draft form and about 95% in ﬁnished
form.
Here, we report the results of an international collaboration
involving centres in the United States and the United Kingdom to
produce a high-quality draft sequence of the mouse genome and a
broad scientiﬁc network to analyse the data. The draft sequence was
generated by assembling about sevenfold sequence coverage from
female mice of the C57BL/6J strain (referred to below as B6). The
assembly contains about 96% of the sequence of the euchromatic
genome (excluding chromosome Y) in sequence contigs linked
together into large units, usually larger than 50 megabases (Mb).
With the availability of a draft sequence of the mouse genome, we
have undertaken an initial comparative analysis to examine the
similarities and differences between the human and mouse gen-
omes. Some of the important points are listed below.
† The mouse genome is about 14% smaller than the human
genome (2.5 Gb compared with 2.9 Gb). The difference probably
reﬂects a higher rate of deletion in the mouse lineage.
† Over 90% of the mouse and human genomes can be partitioned
into corresponding regions of conserved synteny, reﬂecting seg-
ments in which the gene order in the most recent common ancestor
has been conserved in both species.
† At the nucleotide level, approximately 40% of the human genome
can be aligned to the mouse genome. These sequences seem to
represent most of the orthologous sequences that remain in both
lineages from the common ancestor, with the rest likely to have been
deleted in one or both genomes.
† The neutral substitution rate has been roughly half a nucleotide
substitution per site since the divergence of the species, with about
twice as many of these substitutions having occurred in the mouse
compared with the human lineage.
† By comparing the extent of genome-wide sequence conservation
to the neutral rate, the proportion of small (50–100 bp) segments in
the mammalian genome that is under (purifying) selection can be
estimated to be about 5%. This proportion is much higher than can
be explained by protein-coding sequences alone, implying that the
genome contains many additional features (such as untranslated
regions, regulatory elements, non-protein-coding genes, and chro-
mosomal structural elements) under selection for biological
function.
† The mammalian genome is evolving in a non-uniform manner,

with various measures of divergence showing substantial variation
across the genome.
† The mouse and human genomes each seem to contain about
30,000 protein-coding genes. These reﬁned estimates have been
derived from both new evidence-based analyses that produce larger
and more complete sets of gene predictions, and new de novo gene
predictions that do not rely on previous evidence of transcription or
homology. The proportion of mouse genes with a single identiﬁable
orthologue in the human genome seems to be approximately 80%.
The proportion of mouse genes without any homologue currently
detectable in the human genome (and vice versa) seems to be less
than 1%.
† Dozens of local gene family expansions have occurred in the
mouse lineage. Most of these seem to involve genes related to
reproduction, immunity and olfaction, suggesting that these
physiological systems have been the focus of extensive lineage-
speciﬁc innovation in rodents.
† Mouse–human sequence comparisons allow an estimate of the
rate of protein evolution in mammals. Certain classes of secreted
proteins implicated in reproduction, host defence and immune
response seem to be under positive selection, which drives rapid
evolution.
† Despite marked differences in the activity of transposable
elements between mouse and human, similar types of repeat
sequences have accumulated in the corresponding genomic regions
in both species. The correlation is stronger than can be explained
simply by local (GþC) content and points to additional factors
inﬂuencing how the genome is moulded by transposons.
† By additional sequencing in other mouse strains, we have
identiﬁed about 80,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
The distribution of SNPs reveals that genetic variation among
mouse strains occurs in large blocks, mostly reﬂecting contributions
of the two subspecies Mus musculus domesticus and Mus musculus
musculus to current laboratory strains.
The mouse genome sequence is freely available in public data-
bases (GenBank accession number CAAA01000000) and is acces-
sible through various genome browsers (http://www.ensembl.org/
Mus_musculus/, http://genome.ucsc.edu/ and http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/genome/guide/mouse/).
In this paper, we begin with information about the generation,
assembly and evaluation of the draft genome sequence, the con-
servation of synteny between the mouse and human genomes, and
the landscape of the mouse genome. We then explore the repeat
sequences, genes and proteome of the mouse, emphasizing com-
parisons with the human. This is followed by evolutionary analysis
of selection and mutation in the mouse and human lineages, as well
as polymorphism among current mouse strains. A full and detailed
description of the methods underlying these studies is provided as
Supplementary Information. In many respects, the current paper is
a companion to the recent paper on the human genome sequence1.
Extensive background information about many of the topics dis-
cussed below is provided there.
Background to the mouse genome sequencing project
Origins of the mouse
The precise origin of the mouse and human lineages has been the
subject of recent debate. Palaeontological evidence has long indi-
cated a great radiation of placental (eutherian) mammals about 65
million years ago (Myr) that ﬁlled the ecological space left by the
extinction of the dinosaurs, and that gave rise to most of the
eutherian orders23. Molecular phylogenetic analyses indicate earlier
divergence times of many of the mammalian clades. Some of these
studies have suggested a very early date for the divergence of mouse
from other mammals (100–130 Myr23–25) but these estimates par-
tially originate from the fast molecular clock in rodents (see below).
Recent molecular studies that are less sensitive to the differences in
evolutionary rates have suggested that the eutherian mammalian
radiation took place throughout the Late Cretaceous period (65–
100 Myr), but that rodents and primates actually represent relatively
late-branching lineages26,27. In the analyses below, we use a diver-
gence time for the human and mouse lineages of 75 Myr for the
purpose of calculating evolutionary rates, although it is possible
that the actual time may be as recent as 65 Myr.
Origins of mouse genetics
The origin of the mouse as the leading model system for biomedical
research traces back to the start of human civilization, when mice
became commensal with human settlements. Humans noticed
spontaneously arising coat-colour mutants and recorded their
observations for millennia (including ancient Chinese references
to dominant-spotting, waltzing, albino and yellow mice). By the
1700s, mouse fanciers in Japan and China had domesticated many
varieties as pets, and Europeans subsequently imported favourites
and bred them to local mice (thereby creating progenitors of
modern laboratory mice as hybrids among M. m. domesticus,
M. m. musculus and other subspecies). In Victorian England,
‘fancy’ mice were prized and traded, and a National Mouse Club
was founded in 1895 (refs 28, 29).
With the rediscovery of Mendel’s laws of inheritance in 1900,
pioneers of the new science of genetics (such as Cuenot, Castle and
Little) were quick to recognize that the discontinuous variation of
fancy mice was analogous to that of Mendel’s peas, and they set out
to test the new theories of inheritance in mice. Mating programmes
were soon established to create inbred strains, resulting in many of
the modern, well-known strains (including C57BL/6J)30.
Genetic mapping in the mouse began with Haldane’s report31 in
1915 of linkage between the pink-eye dilution and albino loci on the
linkage group that was eventually assigned to mouse chromosome
7, just 2 years after the ﬁrst report of genetic linkage in Drosophila.
The genetic map grew slowly over the next 50 years as new loci and
linkage groups were added—chromosome 7 grew to three loci by
1935 and eight by 1954. The accumulation of serological and
enzyme polymorphisms from the 1960s to the early 1980s began
to ﬁll out the genome, with the map of chromosome 7 harbouring
45 loci by 1982 (refs 29, 31).
The real explosion, however, came with the development of
recombinant DNA technology and the advent of DNA-sequence-
based polymorphisms. Initially, this involved the detection of
restriction-fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs)32; later, the
emphasis shifted to the use of simple sequence length polymorph-
isms (SSLPs; also called microsatellites), which could be assayed
easily by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)33–36 and readily revealed
polymorphisms between inbred laboratory strains.
Origins of mouse genomics
When the Human Genome Project (HGP) was launched in 1990, it
included the mouse as one of its ﬁve central model organisms, and
targeted the creation of genetic, physical and eventually sequence
maps of the mouse genome.
By 1996, a dense genetic map with nearly 6,600 highly poly-
morphic SSLP markers ordered in a common cross had been
developed34, providing the standard tool for mouse genetics. Sub-
sequent efforts ﬁlled out the map to over 12,000 polymorphic
markers, although not all of these loci have been positioned
precisely relative to one another. With these and other loci,
Haldane’s original two-marker linkage group on chromosome 7
had now swelled to about 2,250 loci.
Physical maps of the mouse genome also proceeded apace, using
sequence-tagged sites (STS) together with radiation-hybrid
panels37,38 and yeast artiﬁcial chromosome (YAC) libraries to con-
struct dense landmark maps39. Together, the genetic and physical
maps provide thousands of anchor points that can be used to tie

clones or DNA sequences to speciﬁc locations in the mouse genome.
Other resources included large collections of expressed-sequence
tags (EST)40, a growing number of full-length complementary
DNAs41,42 and excellent bacterial artiﬁcial chromosome (BAC)
libraries43. The latter have been used for deriving large sets of
BAC-end sequences37 and, as part of this collaboration, to generate
a ﬁngerprint-based physical map44. Furthermore, key mouse gen-
ome databases were developed at the Jackson (http://www.infor-
matics. jax.org/), Harwell (http://www.har.mrc.ac.uk/) and RIKEN
(http://genome.rtc.riken.go.jp/) laboratories to provide the com-
munity with access to this information.
With these resources, it became straightforward (but not always
easy) to perform positional cloning of classic single-gene mutations
for visible, behavioural, immunological and other phenotypes.
Many of these mutations provide important models of human
disease, sometimes recapitulating human phenotypes with uncanny
accuracy. It also became possible for the ﬁrst time to begin dissecting
polygenic traits by genetic mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL)
for such traits.
Continuing advances fuelled a growing desire for a complete
sequence of the mouse genome. The development of improved
random mutagenesis protocols led to the establishment of large-
scale screens to identify interesting new mutants, increasing the
need for more rapid positional cloning strategies. QTL mapping
experiments succeeded in localizing more than 1,000 loci affecting
physiological traits, creating demand for efﬁcient techniques
capable of trawling through large genomic regions to ﬁnd the
underlying genes. Furthermore, the ability to perform directed
mutagenesis of the mouse germ line through homologous recom-
bination made it possible to manipulate any gene given its DNA
sequence, placing an increasing premium on sequence information.
In all of these cases, it was clear that genome sequence information
could markedly accelerate progress.
Origin of the Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium
With the sequencing of the human genome well underway by 1999,
a concerted effort to sequence the entire mouse genome was
organized by a Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium (MGSC).
The MGSC originally consisted of three large sequencing centres—
the Whitehead/Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
Center for Genome Research, the Washington University Genome
Sequencing Center, and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute—
together with an international database, Ensembl, a joint project
between the European Bioinformatics Institute and the Sanger
Institute.
In addition to the genome-wide efforts of the MGSC, other
publicly funded groups have been contributing to the sequencing of
the mouse genome in speciﬁc regions of biological interest.
Together, the MGSC and these programmes have so far yielded
clone-based draft sequence consisting of 1,859 Mb (74%, although
there is redundancy) and ﬁnished sequence of 477 Mb (19%) of the
mouse genome. Furthermore, Mural and colleagues45 recently
reported a draft sequence of mouse chromosome 16 containing
87 Mb (3.5%).
To analyse the data reported here, the MGSC was expanded to
include the other publicly funded sequencing groups and a Mouse
Genome Analysis Group consisting of scientists from 27 institutions
in 6 countries.
Generating the draft genome sequence
Sequencing strategy
Sanger and co-workers developed the strategy of random shotgun
sequencing in the early 1980s, and it has remained the mainstay of
genome sequencing over the ensuing two decades. The approach
involves producing random sequence ‘reads’, generating a prelimi-
nary assembly on the basis of sequence overlaps, and then perform-
ing directed sequencing to obtain a ‘ﬁnished’ sequence with gaps
closed and ambiguities resolved46. Ansorge and colleagues47
extended the technique by the use of ‘paired-end sequencing’, in
which sequencing is performed from both ends of a cloned insert
to obtain linking information, which is then used in sequence
assembly. More recently, Myers and co-workers48, and others,
have developed efﬁcient algorithms for exploiting such linking
information.
A principal issue in the sequencing of large, complex genomes has
been whether to perform shotgun sequencing on the entire genome
at once (whole-genome shotgun, WGS) or to ﬁrst break the genome
into overlapping large-insert clones and to perform shotgun
sequencing on these intermediates (hierarchical shotgun)46. The
WGS technique has the advantage of simplicity and rapid early
coverage; it readily works for simple genomes with few repeats, but
there can be difﬁculties encountered with genomes that contain
highly repetitive sequences (such as the human genome, which has
near-perfect repeats spanning hundreds of kilobases). Hierarchical
shotgun sequencing overcomes such difﬁculties by using local
assembly, thus decreasing the number of repeat copies in each
assembly and allowing comparison of large regions of overlaps
between clones. Consequently, efforts to produce ﬁnished
sequences of complex genomes have relied on either pure hierarch-
ical shotgun sequencing (including those of Caenorhabditis ele-
gans49, Arabidopsis thaliana49 and human1) or a combination of
WGS and hierarchical shotgun sequencing (including those of
Drosophila melanogaster50, human2 and rice51).
The ultimate aim of the MGSC is to produce a ﬁnished, richly
annotated sequence of the mouse genome to serve as a permanent
reference for mammalian biology. In addition, we wished to
produce a draft sequence as rapidly as possible to aid in the
interpretation of the human genome sequence and to provide a
useful intermediate resource to the research community. Accord-
ingly, we adopted a hybrid strategy for sequencing the mouse
genome. The strategy has four components: (1) production of a
BAC-based physical map of the mouse genome by ﬁngerprinting
and sequencing the ends of clones of a BAC library44; (2) WGS
sequencing to approximately sevenfold coverage and assembly to
generate an initial draft genome sequence; (3) hierarchical shotgun
sequencing of BAC clones covering the mouse genome combined
with the WGS data to create a hybrid WGS-BAC assembly; and (4)
production of a ﬁnished sequence by using the BAC clones as a
template for directed ﬁnishing. This mixed strategy was designed to
exploit the simpler organizational aspects of WGS assemblies in the
initial phase, while still culminating in the complete high-quality
sequence afforded by clone-based maps.
We chose to sequence DNA from a single mouse strain, rather
than from a mixture of strains45, to generate a solid reference
foundation, reasoning that polymorphic variation in other strains
could be added subsequently (see below). After extensive consul-
tation with the scientiﬁc community52, the B6 strain was selected
because of its principal role in mouse genetics, including its well-
characterized phenotype and role as the background strain on
which many important mutations arose. We elected to sequence a
female mouse to obtain equal coverage of chromosome X and
autosomes. Chromosome Y was thus omitted, but this chromosome
is highly repetitive (the human chromosome Y has multiple
duplicated regions exceeding 100 kb in size with 99.9% sequence
identity53) and seemed an unwise target for the WGS approach.
Instead, mouse chromosome Yis being sequenced by a purely clone-
based (hierarchical shotgun) approach.
Sequencing and assembly
The genome assembly was based on a total of 41.4 million sequence
reads derived from both ends of inserts (paired-end reads) of
various clone types prepared from B6 female DNA. The inserts
ranged in size from 2 to 200 kb (Table 1). The three large MGSC
articles

sequencing centres generated 40.4 million reads, and 0.6 million
reads were generated at the University of Utah. In addition, we used
0.4 million reads from both ends of BAC inserts reported by The
Institute for Genome Research54.
A total of 33.6 million reads passed extensive checks for quality
and source, of which 29.7 million were paired; that is, derived from
opposite ends of the same clone (Table 1). The assembled reads
represent approximately 7.7-fold sequence coverage of the euchro-
matic mouse genome (6.5-fold coverage in bases with a Phred
quality score of .20)55. Together, the clone inserts provide roughly
47-fold physical coverage of the genome.
The sequence reads, together with the pairing information, were
used as input for two recently developed sequence-assembly pro-
grams, Arachne56,57 and Phusion58. No mapping information and no
clone-based sequences were used in the WGS assembly, with the
exception of a few reads (,0.1% of the total) derived from a handful
of BACs, which were used as internal controls. The assembly
programs were tested and compared on intermediate data sets
over the course of the project and were thereby reﬁned. The
programs produced comparable outputs in the ﬁnal assembly.
The assembly generated by Arachne was chosen as the draft
sequence described here because it yielded greater short-range
and long-range continuity with comparable accuracy.
The assembly contains 224,713 sequence contigs, which are
connected by at least two read-pair links into supercontigs (or
scaffolds). There are a total of 7,418 supercontigs at least 2 kb in
length, plus a further 37,125 smaller supercontigs representing
,1% of the assembly. The contigs have an N50 length of 24.8 kb,
whereas the supercontigs have an N50 length that is approximately
700-fold larger at 16.9 Mb (N50 length is the size x such that 50% of
the assembly is in units of length at least x). In fact, most of the
genome lies in supercontigs that are extremely large: the 200 largest
supercontigs span more than 98% of the assembled sequence, of
which 3% is within sequence gaps (Table 2).
Anchoring to chromosomes
We assigned as many supercontigs as possible to chromosomal
locations in the proper order and orientation. Supercontigs were
localized largely by sequence alignments with the extensively vali-
dated mouse genetic map34, with some additional localization
provided by the mouse radiation-hybrid map37 and the BAC
map44. We found no evidence of incorrect global joins within the
supercontigs (that is, multiple markers supporting two discordant
locations within the genome), and thus were able to place them
directly. Altogether, we placed 377 supercontigs, including all
supercontigs .500 kb in length.
Once much of the sequence was anchored, it was possible to
exploit additional read-pair and physical mapping information to
obtain greater continuity (Table 2). For example, some adjacent
supercontigs were connected by BAC-end (or other) links, satisfying
appropriate length and orientation constraints, including single
links. Furthermore, some adjacent extended supercontigs were
connected by means of ﬁngerprint contigs in the BAC-based
physical map. These additional links were used to join sequences

into ultracontigs. In the end, a total of 88 ultracontigs with an N50
length of 50.6 Mb (exclusive of gaps) contained 95.7% of the
assembled sequence (Fig. 1). Continuity near telomeres tends to
be lower, and two chromosomes (5 and X) have unusually large
numbers of ultracontigs.
Proportion of genome contained in the assembly
This was assessed by comparison with publicly available ﬁnished
genome sequence and mouse cDNA sequences. Of the 187 Mb of
ﬁnished mouse sequence, 96% was contained in the anchored
assembly. This ﬁnished sequence, however, is not a completely
random cross-section of the genome (it has been cloned as BACs,
ﬁnished, and in some cases selected on the basis of its gene content).
Of 11,452 cDNA sequences from the curated RefSeq collection,
99.3% of the cDNAs could be aligned to the genome sequence (see
Supplementary Information). These alignments contained 96.4% of
the cDNA bases. Together, this indicates that the draft genome
sequence includes approximately 96% of the euchromatic portion
of the mouse genome, with about 95% anchored (Table 1).
Genome size
On the basis of the estimated sizes of the ultracontigs and gaps
between them, the total length of the euchromatic mouse genome
was estimated to be about 2.5 Gb (see Supplementary Information),
or about 14% smaller than that of the euchromatic human genome
(about 2.9 Gb) (Table 3). The ultracontigs include spanned gaps,
whose lengths are estimated on the basis of paired-end reads and
alignment against the human sequence (see below). To test the
accuracy of the ultracontig lengths, we compared the actual length
of 675 ﬁnished mouse BAC sequences (from the B6 strain) with the
corresponding estimated length from the draft genome sequence.
The ratio of estimated length to actual length had a median value of
0.9994, with 68% of cases falling within 0.99–1.01 and 84% of cases
within 0.98–1.02.
Quality assessment at intermediate scale
Although no evidence of large-scale misassembly was found when
anchoring the assembly onto the mouse chromosomes, we exam-
ined the assembly for smaller errors.
To assess the accuracy at an intermediate scale, we compared the
positions of well-studied markers on the mouse genetic map and in
the genome assembly (see Supplementary Information). Out of 2,605
genetic markers that were unambiguously mapped to the sequence
assembly (BLAST match using 102100 or better as an E-value to a
single location) we found 1.8% in which the chromosomal assign-
ment in the genetic map conﬂicted with that in the sequence. This is
well within the known range of erroneous assignments within the
genetic map34. We tested 11 such discrepant markers by re-mapping
them in a mouse cross. In ten cases, the data showed that the
previous genetic map assignment was erroneous and supported
the position in the draft sequence. In one case, the data supported
the previous genetic map assignment and contradicted the assem-
bly. By studying the one erroneous case, we recognized that a single
36-kb segment had been erroneously merged into a sequence contig
by means of a single overlap of two reads. We screened the entire
assembly for similar instances, affecting regions of at least 20 kb.
Only 17 additional cases were found, with a median size of
the incorrectly merged segment of 34 kb. These are being corrected
in the next release of the MGSC sequence. We are continuing
to investigate instances involving smaller incorrectly merged
segments.
We also found 19 instances (0.7%) of conﬂicts in local marker
order between the genetic map and sequence assembly. A conﬂict
was deﬁned as any instance that would require changing more than
a single genotype in the data underlying the genetic map to resolve.
We studied ten cases by re-mapping the genetic markers, and eight
were found to be due to errors in the genetic map. On the basis of
this analysis, we estimate that chromosomal misassignment and
local misordering affects ,0.3% of the assembled sequence.
Quality assessment at ﬁne scale
We also assessed ﬁne-scale accuracy of the assembly by carefully
aligning it to about 10 Mb of ﬁnished BAC-derived sequence from
the B6 strain. This revealed a total of 39 discrepancies of $50 bp in
length (median size of 320 bp), reﬂecting small misassemblies either
in the draft sequence or the ﬁnished BAC sequences. These dis-
crepancies typically occurred at the ends of contigs in the WGS
assembly, indicating that they may represent the incorrect incor-
poration of a single terminal read.
At the single nucleotide level in the assembly, the observed
discrepancy rates varied in a manner consistent with the quality
scores assigned to the bases in the WGS assembly (see Supplemen-
tary Information). Overall, 96% of nucleotides in the assembly have
Arachne quality scores $40, corresponding to a predicted error rate
of 1 per 10,000 bases. Such bases had an observed discrepancy rate
against ﬁnished sequence of 0.005%, or 5 errors per 100,000 bases.
Comparison with the draft sequence of chromosome 16
We also compared the sequence reported here to a draft sequence
of mouse chromosome 16 recently published by Mural and
Figure 1 The mouse genome in 88 sequence-based ultracontigs. The position and extent
of the 88 ultracontigs of the MGSCv3 assembly are shown adjacent to ideograms of the
mouse chromosomes. All mouse chromosomes are acrocentric, with the centromeric end
at the top of each chromosome. The supercontigs of the sequence assembly were
anchored to the mouse chromosomes using the MIT genetic map. Neighbouring
supercontigs were linked together into ultracontigs using information from single BAC
links and the ﬁngerprint and radiation-hybrid maps, resulting in 88 ultracontigs containing
95% of the bases in the euchromatic genome.

co-workers45. Because the latter was produced from strain 129 and
other mouse strains, it is expected to differ slightly at the nucleotide
level but should otherwise show good agreement. The sequences
align well at large scales (hundreds of kilobases), although the
assembly by Mural and co-workers contains less total sequence
(87 compared with 91 Mb) and includes a region of approximately
300 kb that we place on chromosome X. There were differences at
intermediate scales, with our draft sequence showing better agree-
ment with ﬁnished BAC-derived sequences (approximately fourfold
fewer discrepancies of length $500 bp; 20 compared with 5 in about
2.8 Mb of ﬁnished sequence). These could not be explained by strain
differences, as similar results were seen with ﬁnished sequence from
the B6 and 129 strains.
Collapse of duplicated regions
The human genome contains many large duplicated regions,
estimated to comprise roughly 5% of the genome59, with nearly
identical sequence. If such regions are also common in the mouse
genome, they might collapse into a single copy in the WGS
assembly. Such artefactual collapse could be detected as regions
with unusually high read coverage, compared with the average
depth of 7.4-fold in long assembled contigs. We searched for contigs
that were .20 kb in size and contained .10 kb of sequence in which
the read coverage was at least twofold higher than the average. Such
regions comprised only a tiny fraction (,0.0001) of the total
assembly, of which only half had been anchored to a chromosome.
None of these windows had coverage exceeding the average by more
than threefold. This may indicate that the mouse genome contains
fewer large regions of near-exact duplication than the human.
Alternatively, regions of near-exact duplication may have been
systematically excluded by the WGS assembly programme. This
issue is better addressed through hierarchical shotgun than WGS
sequencing and will be examined more carefully in the course of
producing a ﬁnished mouse genome sequence.
Unplaced reads and large tandem repeats
We expected that highly repetitive regions of the genome would not
be assembled or would not be anchored on the chromosomes.
Indeed, 5.9 million of the 33.6 million passing reads were not part of
anchored sequence, with 88% of these not assembled into sequence
contigs and 12% assembled into small contigs but not chromoso-
mally localized.
A striking example of unassembled sequence is a large region on
mouse chromosome 1 that contains a tandem expansion of
sequence containing the Sp100-rs gene fusion. This region is highly
variable among mouse species and even laboratory strains, with
estimated lengths ranging from 6 to 200 Mb60,61. The bulk of this
regionwas not reliably assembled in the draft genome sequence. The
individual sequence reads together were found to contain 493-fold
coverage of the Sp100-rs gene, suggesting that there are roughly 60
copies in the B6 genome (corresponding to a region of about 6 Mb).
This is consistent with an estimate of 50 copies in B6 obtained by
Southern blotting62.
We also examined centromeric sequences, including the euchro-
matin-proximal major satellite repeat (234 bases) and the telomere-
proximal minor repeat (120 bases) found on some chromo-
somes63,64. (Note that mouse chromosomes are all acrocentric,
meaning that the centromere is adjacent to one telomere.) The
minor satellite was poorly represented among the sequence reads
(present in about 24,000 reads or ,0.1% of the total) suggesting
that this satellite sequence is difﬁcult to isolate in the cloning
systems used. The major satellite was found in about 3.6% of the
reads; this is also lower than previous estimates based on density
gradient experiments, which found that major satellites comprise
about 5.5% of the mouse genome, or approximately 8 Mb per
chromosome65.
Evaluation of WGS assembly strategy
The WGS assembly described here involved only random reads,
without any additional map-based information. By many criteria,
the assembly is of very high quality. The N50 supercontig size of
16.9 Mb far exceeds that achieved by any previous WGS assembly,
and the agreement with genome-wide maps is excellent. The
assembly quality may be due to several factors, including the use
of high-quality libraries, the variety of insert lengths in multiple

*These gaps had ﬁngerprint contigs spanning them. The size for 18 out of 37 were estimated using conserved synteny to determine the size of the region in the human genome. The remaining gaps were
arbitrarily given the average size of the assessed gaps (59 kb), adjusted to reﬂect the 16% difference in genome size.
†Uncaptured gaps were estimated by mouse–human synteny to have a total size of 5 Mb. However, because some of these gaps are due to repetitive expansions in mouse (absent in human), the actual
total for the uncaptured gaps is probably substantially higher. For example, one large uncaptured gap on chromosome 1 (the Sp-100rs region) is roughly 6 Mb (see text).
‡Omitting centromeres and telomeres. These would add, on average, approximately 8 Mb per chromosome, or about 160 Mb to the genome. Also omitting uncaptured gaps between supercontigs.

libraries, the improved assembly algorithms, and the inbred nature
of the mouse strain (in contrast to the polymorphisms in the human
genome sequences). Another contributing factor may be that the
mouse differs from the human in having less recent segmental
duplication to confound assembly.
Notwithstanding the high quality of the draft genome sequence,
we are mindful that it contains many gaps, small misassemblies and
nucleotide errors. It is likely that these could not all be resolved by
further WGS sequencing, therefore directed sequencing will be
needed to produce a ﬁnished sequence. The results also suggest
that WGS sequencing may sufﬁce for large genomes for which only
draft sequence is required, provided that they contain minimal
amounts of sequence associated with recent segmental duplications
or large, recent interspersed repeat elements.
Adding ﬁnished sequence
As a ﬁnal step, we enhanced the WGS sequence assembly by
substituting available ﬁnished BAC-derived sequence from the B6
strain. In total, we replaced 3,528 draft sequence contigs with
48.2 Mb of ﬁnished sequence from 210 ﬁnished BACs available at
the time of the assembly. The resulting draft genome sequence,
MGSCv3, was submitted to the public databases and is freely
available in electronic form through various sources (see below).
The sequence data and assemblies have been freely available
throughout the course of the project. The next step of the project,
which is already underway, is to convert the draft sequence into a
ﬁnished sequence. As the MGSC produces additional BAC assem-
blies and ﬁnished sequence, we plan to continue to revise and release
enhanced versions of the genome sequence en route to a completely
ﬁnished sequence66, thereby providing a permanent foundation for
biomedical research in the twenty-ﬁrst century.
Conservation of synteny between mouse and human genomes
With the draft sequence in hand, we began our analysis by
investigating the strong conservation of synteny between the
mouse and human genomes. Beyond providing insight into evolu-
tionary events that have moulded the chromosomes, this analysis
facilitates further comparisons between the genomes.
Starting from a common ancestral genome approximately
75 Myr, the mouse and human genomes have each been shufﬂed
by chromosomal rearrangements. The rate of these changes, how-
ever, is low enough that local gene order remains largely intact. It is
thus possible to recognize syntenic (literally ‘same thread’) regions
in the two species that have descended relatively intact from the
common ancestor.
The earliest indication that genes reside in similar relative
positions in different mammalian species traces to the observation
that the albino and pink-eye dilution mutants are genetically closely
linked in both mouse and rat67,68. Signiﬁcant experimental evidence
came from genetic studies of somatic cells69. In 1984, Nadeau and
Taylor70 used mouse linkage data and human cytogenetic data to
compare the chromosomal locations of orthologous genes. On the
basis of a small data set (83 loci), they extrapolated that the mouse
and human genomes could be parsed into roughly 180 syntenic
regions. During two decades of subsequent work, the density of the
synteny map has been increased, but the estimated number of
syntenic regions has remained close to the original projection. A
recent gene-based synteny map37 used more than 3,600 orthologous
loci to deﬁne about 200 regions of conserved synteny. However, it is
recognized that such maps might still miss regions owing to
insufﬁcient marker density.
With a robust draft sequence of the mouse genome and .90%
ﬁnished sequence of the human genome in hand, it is possible to
undertake a more comprehensive analysis of conserved synteny.
Rather than simply relying on known human–mouse gene pairs, we
identiﬁed a much larger set of orthologous landmarks as follows.
We performed sequence comparisons of the entire mouse and
human genome sequences using the PatternHunter program71 to
identify regions having a similarity score exceeding a high threshold
(.40, corresponding to a minimum of a 40-base perfect match,
with penalties for mismatches and gaps), with the additional
property that each sequence is the other’s unique match above
this threshold. Such regions probably reﬂect orthologous sequence
pairs, derived from the same ancestral sequence.
About 558,000 orthologous landmarks were identiﬁed; in the
mouse assembly, these sequences have a mean spacing of about
4.4 kb and an N50 length of about 500 bp. The landmarks had a total
length of roughly 188 Mb, comprising about 7.5% of the mouse
genome. It should be emphasized that the landmarks represent only
a small subset of the sequences, consisting of those that can be
aligned with the highest similarity between the mouse and human
genomes. (Indeed, below we show that about 40% of the human
genome can be aligned conﬁdently with the mouse genome.)
The locations of the landmarks in the two genomes were then
compared to identify regions of conserved synteny. We deﬁne a
syntenic segment to be a maximal region in which a series of
landmarks occur in the same order on a single chromosome in
both species. A syntenic block in turn is one or more syntenic
segments that are all adjacent on the same chromosome in human
and on the same chromosome in mouse, but which may otherwise
be shufﬂed with respect to order and orientation. To avoid small
artefactual syntenic segments owing to imperfections in the two
draft genome sequences, we only considered regions above 300 kb
and ignored occasional isolated interruptions in conserved order
(see Supplementary Information). Thus, some small syntenic seg-
ments have probably been omitted—this issue will be addressed best
when ﬁnished sequences of the two genomes are completed.
Marked conservation of landmark order was found across most
of the two genomes (Fig. 2). Each genome could be parsed into a
total of 342 conserved syntenic segments. On average, each land-
mark resides in a segment containing 1,600 other landmarks. The
segments vary greatly in length, from 303 kb to 64.9 Mb, with a
mean of 6.9 Mb and an N50 length of 16.1 Mb. In total, about
90.2% of the human genome and 93.3% of the mouse genome
Figure 2 Conservation of synteny between human and mouse. We detected 558,000
highly conserved, reciprocally unique landmarks within the mouse and human genomes,
which can be joined into conserved syntenic segments and blocks (deﬁned in text). A
typical 510-kb segment of mouse chromosome 12 that shares common ancestry with a
600-kb section of human chromosome 14 is shown. Blue lines connect the reciprocal
unique matches in the two genomes. The cyan bars represent sequence coverage in each
of the two genomes for the regions. In general, the landmarks in the mouse genome are
more closely spaced, reﬂecting the 14% smaller overall genome size.

unambiguously reside within conserved syntenic segments. The
segments can be aggregated into a total of 217 conserved syntenic
blocks, with an N50 length of 23.2 Mb.
The nature and extent of conservation of synteny differs sub-
stantially among chromosomes (Fig. 3 and Table 4). In accordance
with expectation, the X chromosomes are represented as single,
reciprocal syntenic blocks72. Human chromosome 20 corresponds
entirely to a portion of mouse chromosome 2, with nearly perfect
conservation of order along almost the entire length, disrupted only
by a small central segment (Fig. 4a, d). Human chromosome 17
corresponds entirely to a portion of mouse chromosome 11, but
extensive rearrangements have divided it into at least 16 segments
(Fig. 4b, e). Other chromosomes, however, show evidence of much
more extensive interchromosomal rearrangement than these cases
(Fig. 4c, f).
We compared the new sequence-based map of conserved synteny
with the most recent previous map based on 3,600 loci30. The new
map reveals many more conserved syntenic segments (342 com-
pared with 202) but only slightly more conserved syntenic blocks
(217 compared with 170). Most of the conserved syntenic blocks
had previously been recognized and are consistent with the new
map, but many rearrangements of segments within blocks had been
missed (notably on the X chromosome).
The occurrence of many local rearrangements is not surprising.
Compared with interchromosomal rearrangements (for example,
translocations), paracentric inversions (that is, those within a single
chromosome and not including the centromere) carry a lower
selective disadvantage in terms of the frequency of aneuploidy
among offspring. These are also seen at a higher frequency in genera
such as Drosophila, in which extensive cytogenetic comparisons
have been carried out73,74.
The block and segment sizes are broadly consistent with the
random breakage model of genome evolution75 (Fig. 5). At this
gross level, there is no evidence of extensive selection for gene order
across the genome. Selection in speciﬁc regions, however, is by no
means excluded, and indeed seems probable (for example, for the
major histocompatibility complex). Moreover, the analysis does not
exclude the possibility that chromosomal breaks may tend to occur
with higher frequency in some locations.
With a map of conserved syntenic segments between the human
and mouse genomes, it is possible to calculate the minimal number
of rearrangements needed to ‘transform’ one genome into the
other70,76,77. When applied to the 342 syntenic segments above, the
most parsimonious path has 295 rearrangements. The analysis
suggests that chromosomal breaks may have a tendency to reoccur
in certain regions. With only two species, however, it is not yet
possible to recover the ancestral chromosomal order or reconstruct
the precise pathway of rearrangements. As more mammalian species
are sequenced, it should be possible to draw such inferences and
study the nature of chromosome rearrangement.
Genome landscape
We next sought to analyse the contents of the mouse genome, both
in its own right and in comparison with corresponding regions of
the human genome. The poster included with this issue provides a
high-level view of the mouse genome, showing such features as
genes and gene predictions, repetitive sequence content, (GþC)
content, synteny with the human genome, and mouse QTLs.
Figure 3 Segments and blocks .300 kb in size with conserved synteny in human are
superimposed on the mouse genome. Each colour corresponds to a particular human
chromosome. The 342 segments are separated from each other by thin, white lines within
the 217 blocks of consistent colour.

All of the mouse genome information is accessible in electronic
form through various browsers: Ensembl (http://www.ensembl.org),
the University of California at Santa Cruz (http://genome.ucsc.edu)
and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). These browsers allow users to scroll along
the chromosomes and zoom in or out to any scale, as well as to display
information at any desired level of detail. The mouse genome
information has also been integrated into existing human genome
browsers at these same organizations. In this section, we compare
general properties of the mouse and human genomes.
Genome expansion and contraction
The projected total length of the euchromatic portion of the mouse
genome (2.5 Gb) is about 14% smaller than that of the human
genome (2.9 Gb). To investigate the source of this difference, we
examined the relative size of intervals between consecutive ortho-
logous landmarks in the human and mouse genomes. The mouse/
human ratio has a mean at 0.91 for autosomes, but varies widely,
with the mouse interval being larger than the human in 38% of cases
(Fig. 6). Chromosome X, by contrast, shows no net relative expan-
sion or contraction, with a mouse/human ratio of 1.03 (Fig. 6 and
Table 4). What accounts for the smaller size of the mouse genome?
We address this question below in the sections on repeat sequences
and on genome evolution.
(G1C) content
The overall distribution of local (GþC) content is signiﬁcantly
different between the mouse and human genomes (Fig. 7). Such
differences have been noted in biochemical studies78–81 and in
comparative analyses of fourfold degenerate sites in codons of
mouse and human genes82–85, but the availability of nearly complete
genome sequences provides the ﬁrst detailed picture of the
phenomenon.
The mouse has a slightly higher overall (GþC) content than the
human (42% compared with 41%), but the distribution is tighter.
When local (GþC) content is measured in 20-kb windows across
the genome, the human genome has about 1.4% of the windows
with (GþC) content .56% and 1.3% with (GþC) content ,33%.
Such extreme deviations are virtually absent in the mouse genome.
The contrast is even seen at the level of entire chromosomes. The
Figure 4 Dot plots of conserved syntenic segments in three human and three mouse
chromosomes. For each of three human (a–c) and mouse (d–f) chromosomes, the
positions of orthologous landmarks are plotted along the x axis and the corresponding
position of the landmark on chromosomes in the other genome is plotted on the y axis.
Different chromosomes in the corresponding genome are differentiated with distinct
colours. In a remarkable example of conserved synteny, human chromosome 20 (a)
consists of just three segments from mouse chromosome 2 (d), with only one small
segment altered in order. Human chromosome 17 (b) also shares segments with only one
mouse chromosome (11) (e), but the 16 segments are extensively rearranged. However,
most of the mouse and human chromosomes consist of multiple segments from multiple
chromosomes, as shown for human chromosome 2 (c) and mouse chromosome 12 (f).
Circled areas and arrows denote matching segments in mouse and human.

a logarithmic scale. The dots indicate the expected values for the exponential curve of
random breakage given the number of blocks and segments, respectively.

human has extreme outliers with respect to (GþC) content (the
most extreme being chromosome 19), whereas the mouse chromo-
somes tend to be far more uniform (Fig. 8).
There is a strong positive correlation in local (GþC) content
between orthologous regions in the mouse and human genomes
(Fig. 9), but with the mouse regions showing a clear tendency to be
less extreme in (GþC) content than the human regions. This
tendency is not uniform, with the most extreme differences seen
at the tails of the distribution.
In mammalian genomes, there is a positive correlation between
gene density and (GþC) content81,86–89. Given the differences in
(GþC) content between human and mouse, we compared the
distribution of genes—using the sets of orthologous mouse and
human genes described below—with respect to (GþC) content for
both genomes (Fig. 9). The density of genes differed markedly when
expressed in terms of absolute (GþC) content, but was nearly
identical when expressed in terms of percentiles of (GþC) content
(Fig. 9). For example, both species have 75–80% of genes residing in
the (GþC)-richest half of their genome. Mouse and human thus
show similar degrees of homogeneity in the distribution of genes,
despite the overall differences in (GþC) content. Notably, the
mouse shows similar extremes of gene density despite being less
extreme in (GþC) content.
What accounts for the differences in (GþC) content between
mouse and human? Does it reﬂect altered selection for (GþC)
content90,91, altered mutational or repair processes92–94, or possibly
both? Data from additional species will probably be needed to
address these issues. Any explanation will need to account for
various mysterious phenomena. For example, although overall
(GþC) content in mouse is slightly higher than in human (42%
compared with 41%), the (GþC) content of chromosome X is
slightly lower (39.0% compared with 39.4%). The effect is even
more pronounced if one excludes lineage-speciﬁc repeats (see
below), thereby focusing primarily on shared DNA. In that case,
mouse autosomes have an overall (GþC) content that is 1.5%
higher than human autosomes (41.2% compared with 39.7%)
whereas mouse chromosome X has a (GþC) content that is 1%
lower than human chromosome X (37.8% compared with 36.8%).
CpG islands
In mammalian genomes, the palindromic dinucleotide CpG is
usually methylated on the cytosine residue. Methyl-CpG is mutated
by deamination to TpG, leading to approximately ﬁvefold under-
representation of CpG across the human1,95 and mouse genomes. In
some regions of the genome that have been implicated in gene
regulation, CpG dinucleotides are not methylated and thus are not
subject to deamination and mutation. Such regions, termed CpG
islands, are usually a few hundred nucleotides in length, have high
(GþC) content and above average representation of CpG
dinucleotides.
We applied a computer program that attempts to recognize CpG
islands on the basis of (GþC) and CpG content of arbitrary lengths
of sequence96,97 to the non-repetitive portions of human and mouse
genome sequences (see Supplementary Information). The mouse
genome contains fewer CpG islands than the human genome (about
15,500 compared with 27,000), which is qualitatively consistent
with previous reports98. The absolute number of islands identiﬁed
Figure 6 Size ratio of mouse to human for orthologous 100-kb windows. For each 100-kb
region of the mouse genome, the size ratio to the related segment of the human genome
was determined. The frequency of the various ratios is plotted on a logarithmic scale for
both the autosomes (blue line) and the X chromosome (red line). The ratio for autosomes
shows a mean of 0.91 but the ratio varies widely, with the mouse genome larger for
38% of the intervals. The X chromosome by contrast has a mean ratio of just over 1.0.
Indeed, chromosome X is slightly smaller in human.
Figure 7 Distribution of (GþC) content in the mouse (blue) and human (red) genomes.
Mouse has a higher mean (GþC) content than human (42% compared with 41%), but
human has a larger fraction of windows with either high or low (GþC) content. The
distribution was determined using the unmasked genomes in 20-kb non-overlapping
windows, with the fraction of windows (y axis) in each percentage bin (x axis) plotted for
both human and mouse.
Figure 8 (GþC) content and density of CpG islands shows more variability in human (red)
than mouse (blue) chromosomes. a, The (GþC) content for each of the mouse
chromosomes is relatively similar, whereas human chromosomes show more variation;
chromosomes 16, 17, 19 and 22 have higher (GþC) content, and chromosome 13 lower
(GþC) content. b, Similarly, the density of CpG islands is relatively homogenous for all
mouse chromosomes and more variable in human, with the same exceptions. Note that
the mouse and human chromosomes are matched by chromosome number, not by
regions of conserved synteny.

depends on the precise deﬁnition of a CpG island used, but the ratio
between the two species remains fairly constant.
The reason for the smaller number of predicted CpG islands in
mouse may relate simply to the smaller fraction of the genome with
extremely high (GþC) content99 and its effect on the computer
algorithm. Approximately 10,000 of the predicted CpG islands in
each species show signiﬁcant sequence conservation with CpG
islands in the orthologous intervals in the other species, falling
within the orthologous landmarks described above. Perhaps these
represent functional CpG islands, a proposition that can now be
tested experimentally84.
Repeats
The single most prevalent feature of mammalian genomes is their
repetitive sequences, most of which are interspersed repeats repre-
senting ‘fossils’ of transposable elements. Transposable elements are
a principal force in reshaping the genome, and their fossils thus
provide powerful reporters for measuring evolutionary forces act-
ing on the genome. A recent paper on the human genome sequence1
provided extensive background on mammalian transposons,
describing their biology and illustrating many applications to
evolutionary studies. Here, we will focus primarily on comparisons
between the repeat content of the mouse and human genomes.
Mouse has accumulated more new repetitive sequence than human
Approximately 46% of the human genome can be recognized
currently as interspersed repeats resulting from insertions of trans-
posable elements that were active in the last 150–200 million years.
The total fraction of the human genome derived from transposons
may be considerably larger, but it is not possible to recognize fossils
older than a certain age because of the high degree of sequence
divergence. Because only 37.5% of the mouse genome is recognized
as transposon-derived (Table 5), it is tempting to conclude that the
smaller size of the mouse genome is due to lower transposon activity
since the divergence of the human and mouse lineages. Closer
analysis, however, shows that this is not the case. As we discuss
below, transposition has been more active in the mouse lineage. The
apparent deﬁcit of transposon-derived sequence in the mouse
genome is mostly due to a higher nucleotide substitution rate,
which makes it difﬁcult to recognize ancient repeat sequences.
Lineage-speciﬁc versus ancestral repeats
Interspersed repeats can be divided into lineage-speciﬁc repeats
(deﬁned as those introduced by transposition after the divergence of
mouse and human) and ancestral repeats (deﬁned as those already
present in a common ancestor). Such a division highlights the fact
that transposable elements have been more active in the mouse
lineage than in the human lineage. Approximately 32.4% of the
mouse genome (about 818 Mb) but only 24.4% of the human
genome (about 695 Mb) consists of lineage-speciﬁc repeats (Table
5). Contrary to initial appearances, transposon insertions have
added at least 120 Mb more transposon-derived sequence to the
mouse genome than to the human genome since their divergence.
This observation is consistent with the previous report that the rate
of transposition in the human genome has fallen markedly over the
past 40 million years1,100.
The overall lower interspersed repeat density in mouse is the
result of an apparent lack of ancestral repeats: they comprise only
5% of the mouse genome compared with 22% of the human
genome. The ancestral repeats recognizable in mouse tend to be
those of more recent origin, that is, those that originated closest to
the mouse–human divergence. This difference may be due partly to
a higher deletion rate of non-functional DNA in the mouse lineage,
so that more of the older interspersed repeats have been lost.
However, the deﬁcit largely reﬂects a much higher neutral substi-
tution rate in the mouse lineage than in the human lineage,
rendering many older ancestral repeats undetectable with available
computer programs.
Higher substitution rate in mouse lineage
The hypothesis that the neutral substitution rate is higher in mouse
than in human was suggested as early as 1969 (refs 101–103). The
idea has continued to be challenged on the basis that the apparent
differences may be due to inaccuracies in mammalian phyloge-
nies104,105. The explanation, however, remains unclear, with some
attributing it to generation time101,106 and others pointing to a closer
correlation with body size107,108.
Ancestral repeats provide a powerful measure of neutral substi-
tution rates, on the basis of comparing thousands of current copies
to the inferred consensus sequence of the ancestral element. The
large copy number and ubiquitous distribution of ancestral repeats
overcome issues of local variation in substitution rates (see below).
Most notably, differences in divergence levels are not affected by
phylogenetic assumptions, as the time spent by an ancestral repeat
family in either lineage is necessarily identical.
The median divergence levels of 18 subfamilies of interspersed
repeats that were active shortly before the human–rodent speciation
(Table 6) indicates an approximately twofold higher average sub-
stitution rate in the mouse lineage than in the human lineage,
corresponding closely to an early estimate by Wu and Li109. In
human, the least-diverged ancestral repeats have about 16% mis-

mouse (y axis) compared with human (x axis) (GþC) content for all non-overlapping
orthologous 100-kb windows. In general, (GþC) content is correlated between the two
species, but very few mouse windows have a (GþC) content over 55%, even where the
related human window has over 60% (GþC) content. b, Average mouse (GþC) content of
100-kb syntenic windows binned by human (GþC) content (1% intervals). The red line

segments. c–e, Gene content increases with (GþC) content when comparing (GþC) and
gene content in 320-kb non-overlapping, unmasked windows for mouse (blue lines) and

lines) having (GþC) content below a given level. The tighter distribution of (GþC) content
in mouse results in the curve for mouse crossing that for human at 45–46% for both
genes and total sequence. The tendency for both genomes to be gene-poor at low (GþC)
content and gene-rich at high (GþC) content is shown directly in d, which shows the
fraction of genes residing within the portion of the genome having (GþC) content below a
given level (for example, the half of the genome with the lowest (GþC) content contains
25% of the genes). e, The average number of genes per window is plotted against the
(GþC) content of the window for both genomes, showing that the gene density in mouse
reaches the same level as in human but at a lower level of (GþC) content.

match to their consensus sequences, which corresponds to approxi-
mately 0.17 substitutions per site. In contrast, mouse repeats have
diverged by at least 26–27% or about 0.34 substitutions per site,
which is about twofold higher than in the human lineage. The total
number of substitutions in the two lineages can be estimated at 0.51.
Below, we obtain an estimate of a combined rate of 0.46–0.47
substitutions per site, on the basis of an analysis that counts only
substitutions since the divergence of the species (see Supplementary
Information concerning the methods used).
Assuming a speciation time of 75 Myr, the average substitution
rates would have been 2.2 £ 1029 and 4.5 £ 1029 in the human and
mouse lineages, respectively. This is in accord with previous
estimates of neutral substitution rates in these organisms. (Reports
of highly similar substitution rates in human and mouse lineages
relied on a much earlier divergence time of rodents from other
mammals104.)
Comparison of ancestral repeats to their consensus sequence also
allows an estimate of the rate of occurrence of small (,50 bp)
insertions and deletions (indels). Both species show a net loss of
nucleotides (with deleted bases outnumbering inserted bases by at
least 2–3-fold), but the overall loss owing to small indels in ancestral
repeats is at least twofold higher in mouse than in human. This may
contribute a small amount (1–2%) to the difference in genome size
noted above.

The two right columns show the fractions in the human genome (excluding chromosome Y) for comparison. These and all other interspersed repeat-related data are based on RepeatMasker analysis
(version July 2002, sensitive settings, RepBase release 5.3) of the February 2002 mouse and June 2002 human draft assemblies. Each repeat family in the RepeatMasker library was determined to be either
order-speciﬁc or ‘ancestral repeats’ present at orthologous sites, usually on the basis of the average divergence level of the interspersed repeat family copies. For elements with an average divergence of
15–19% in human, copies were checked to be present or absent at mouse orthologous sites, to have inserted in known primate-speciﬁc repeats, or to have inserts of known mammalian-wide elements. No
mammalian-wide repeats were found in the mouse genome that were not already known from the human genome. NA, not applicable.

Shown are the number of kilobases matched by each subfamily (kb), the median divergence (mismatch) level of all copies from the consensus sequence, the interquartile range of these mismatch levels
(range), and a Jukes–Cantor estimate of the substitution level to which the median divergence level corresponds (JC). Notice that RepeatMasker found, on average, four- to ﬁvefold more copies in the
human than in the mouse genome, as a result of the higher DNA loss in the rodent lineage as well a failure to identify many highly diverged copies. The two right columns contain the ratio of the JC substitution
level in mouse over human, and an adjusted ratio (AR) of the mouse and human substitution level after subtraction from both of the approximate fraction accumulated in the common human–mouse
ancestor. For this fraction we have taken the difference between the ancestral repeat average substitution level and least diverged ancestral repeat family (L1MA8). See the Supplementary Information for a
discussion of the origin of the variance in the human and mouse ratios.

It should be noted that the roughly twofold higher substitution
rate in mouse represents an average rate since the time of diver-
gence, including an initial period when the two lineages had
comparable rates. Comparison with more recent relatives
(mouse–rat and human–gibbon, each about 20–25 Myr) indicate
that the current substitution rate per year in mouse is probably
much higher, perhaps about ﬁvefold higher (see Supplementary
Information). Also, note that these estimates refer to substitution
rate per year, rather than per generation. Because the human
generation time is much longer than that of the mouse (by at
least 20-fold), the substitution rate is greater in human than mouse
when measured per generation.
Higher substitution rate obscures old repeats
We measured the impact of the higher substitution rate in mouse on
the ability to detect ancestral repeats in the mouse genome. By
computer simulation, the ability of the RepeatMasker100 program to
detect repeats was found to fall off rapidly for divergence levels
above about 37%. If we simulate the events in the mouse lineage by
adjusting the ancestral repeats in the human genome for the higher
substitution levels that would have occurred in the mouse genome,
the proportion of the genome that would still be recognizable as
ancestral repeats falls to only 6%. This is in close agreement with the
proportion actually observed for the mouse. Thus, the current
analysis of repeated sequences allows us to see further back into
human history (roughly 150–200 Myr) than into mouse history
(roughly 100–120 Myr).
A higher rate of interspersed repeat insertion does not explain the
larger size of the human genome. Below, we suggest that the
explanation lies in a higher rate of large deletions in the mouse
lineage.
Comparison of mouse and human repeats
All mammals have essentially the same four classes of transposable
elements: (1) the autonomous long interspersed nucleotide element
(LINE)-like elements; (2) the LINE-dependent, short RNA-derived
short interspersed nucleotide elements (SINEs); (3) retrovirus-like
elements with long terminal repeats (LTRs); and (4) DNA transpo-
sons. The ﬁrst three classes procreate by reverse transcription of an
RNA intermediate (retroposition), whereas DNA transposons move
by a cut-and-paste mechanism of DNA sequence (see refs 1, 100 for
further information about these classes).
A comparison of these repeat classes in the mouse and human
genomes can be enlightening. On the one hand, differences between
the two species reveal the dynamic nature of transposable elements;
on the other hand, similarities in the location of lineage-speciﬁc
elements point to common biological factors that govern insertion
and retention of interspersed repeats.
Differences between mouse and human
The most notable difference is in the changing rate of transposition
over time: the rate has remained fairly constant in mouse, but
markedly increased to a peak at about 40 Myr in human, and then
plummeted. This phenomenon was noted in our initial analysis of
Figure 10 Age distribution of interspersed repeats in the mouse and human genomes.
This is an update of Fig. 18 in the IHGC human genome paper1. a, b, Distribution for mouse
and human of copies of each repeat class in bins corresponding to 1% increments in
substitution level calculated using Jukes–Cantor formula ðK ¼ 23=4lnð1 2 D*
rest4=3ÞÞ
(see Supplementary Information for deﬁnition). The ﬁrst bin for mouse is artiﬁcially low
because the WGS assembly used for mouse excludes a larger percentage of very recent
repeats. c, d, Interspersed repeats grouped into bins of approximately equal time periods
after adjusting for the different rates of substitution in the two genomes. On average, the
substitution level has been twofold higher in the mouse than in the human lineage (Table
6), but the difference was initially less and has increased over time. The present rates may
differ over fourfold. The activity of transposable elements in the mouse lineage has been
quite uniform compared with the human lineage, where an overall decline was interrupted
temporarily by a burst of Alu activity. The apparent absence of ,2% diverged
interspersed repeats in mouse is primarily due to the shotgun sequencing strategy; long,
closely similar interspersed repeats very often were not assembled. This is supported by
an up to tenfold higher concentration of young L1 and ERV elements at the edges of gaps.
The gradually decreasing density of repeats beyond a 30% substitution level reﬂects in
part the limits of the detection method.

the human genome; the availability of the mouse genome sequence
now conﬁrms and sharpens the observation (Fig. 10). Beyond this
overall tendency, there are speciﬁc differences in each of the four
repeat classes.
The ﬁrst class that we discuss is LINEs. Copies of LINE1 (L1)
form the single largest fraction of interspersed repeat sequence in
both human and mouse. No other LINE seems to have been active in
either lineage. The extant L1 elements in both species derive from a
common ancestor (L1MA6 in Table 6) by means of a series of
subfamilies deﬁned primarily by the rapidly evolving 3
0 non-coding
sequences110. The L1 5
0-untranslated regions (UTRs) in both
lineages have been even more variable, occasionally through acqui-
sition of entirely new sequences111. Indeed, the three active sub-
families in mouse, which are otherwise .97% identical, have
unrelated or highly diverged 5
0 ends112–114. L1 seems to have
remained highly active in mouse, whereas it has declined in the
human lineage. Goodier and co-workers113 estimated that the
mouse genome contains at least 3,000 potentially active elements
(full-length with two intact open reading frames (ORFs)). The
current draft sequence of the mouse genome contains only 400
young, full-length elements; of these only 12 have two intact ORFs.
This is probably a reﬂection of the WGS shotgun approach used to
assemble the genome. Indeed, most of the young elements in the
draft genome sequence are incomplete owing to internal sequence
gaps, reﬂecting the difﬁculty that WGS assembly has with highly
similar repeat sequences. This is a notable limitation of the draft
sequence.
The second repeat class is SINEs. Whereas only a single SINE
(Alu) was active in the human lineage, the mouse lineage has been
exposed to four distinct SINEs (B1, B2, ID, B4). Each is thought to
rely on L1 for retroposition, although none share sequence simi-
larity, as is the rule for other LINE–SINE pairs115,116. The mouse B1
and human Alu SINEs are unique among known SINEs in being
derived from 7SL RNA; they probably have a common origin117. The
mouse B2 is typical among SINEs in having a transfer RNA-derived
promoter region. Recent ID elements seem to be derived from a
neuronally expressed RNA gene called BC1, which may itself have
been recruited from an earlier SINE. This subfamily is minor in
mouse, with 2–4,000 copies, but has expanded rapidly in rat where it
has produced more than 130,000 copies since the mouse–rat
speciation118. Both B2 and ID closely resemble Ala-tRNA, but
seem to have independent origins. The B4 family resembles a fusion
between B1 and ID119,120. We found that 25% of the 75,000 identiﬁed
ID elements were located within 50 bp of a B1 element of similar
orientation, suggesting that perhaps most older ID elements are
mislabelled or truncated B4 SINEs.
More rodent-speciﬁc SINEs are present in the mouse genome
than Alu SINEs in human (1.4 and 1.1 million, respectively), but
they occupy a smaller portion of the genome (7.6% and 10.7%,
respectively) because of their smaller sizes. The existence of four
families in mouse provides independent opportunities to investi-
gate the properties of SINEs (see below).
The third repeat class is LTR elements. All interspersed LTR-
containing elements in mammals are derivatives of the vertebrate-
speciﬁc retrovirus clade of retrotransposons. The earliest infectious
retroviruses probably originated from endogenous retroviral-like
(ERV) elements that acquired mechanisms for horizontal trans-
mission121, whereas many current endogenous retroviral elements
have probably arisen from infection by retroviruses.
Endogenous retroviruses fall into three classes (I–III), which
show a markedly dissimilar evolutionary history in human and
mouse (see Fig. 10). Notably, ERVs are nearly extinct in human
whereas all three classes have active members in mouse.
Class III accounts for 80% of recognized LTR element copies
predating the human–mouse speciation. This class includes the
non-autonomous MaLRs: with 388,000 recognizable copies in
mouse, it is the single most successful LTR element. It is still active
in mouse (represented by MERVL and the MT and ORR1 MaLRs),
but died out some 50 Myr in human122.
Copies of class II elements are tenfold denser in mouse than in
human. Among the active class II elements in mouse are two
abundant and active groups, the intracisternal-A particles (IAP)
and the early-transposons (ETn). About 15% of all spontaneous
mouse mutants have an allele associated with IAP or ETn insertion,
demonstrating the functional consequences of class I element
activity in mice. A third active class, the mouse mammary tumour
virus, is present in only a few copies123 (see Supplementary Infor-
mation). In human, there is evidence for at most a few active
elements (HERVK10 and HERBK113 (ref. 124)). No class II ERVs
are known to predate the human–mouse speciation.
In contrast, class I element copies are fourfold more common in
the human than the mouse genome (although it is possible that
some have not yet been recognized in mouse). In mouse, this class
includes active ERVs, such as the murine leukaemia virus, MuRRS,
MuRVY and VL30 (several of which have caused insertional
mutations in mouse)—no similar activity is known to exist in
human. It is unclear why the class I ERVs have been more successful
in the human lineage whereas the class II ERVs have ﬂourished in
the mouse lineage.
The fourth repeat class is the DNA transposons. Although most
transposable elements have been more active in mouse than human,
DNA transposons show the reverse pattern. Only four lineage-
speciﬁc DNA transposon families could be identiﬁed in mouse (the
mariner element MMAR1, and the hAT elements URR1, RMER30
and RChar1), compared with 14 in the primate lineage.
For evolutionary survival, DNA transposons are thought to
depend on frequent horizontal transfer to new host genomes by
means of vectors such as viruses and other intracellular para-
sites116,125. The mammalian immune system probably forms a
large obstacle to the successful invasion of DNA transposons.
Perhaps the rodent germ line has been harder to inﬁltrate by
horizontal transfer than the primate genome. Alternatively, it is
possible that highly diverged families active in early rodent evolu-
tion have not been detected yet. Notably, most copies in the human
genome were deposited early in primate evolution.
An interesting case is the mariner element, which seems to have
inﬁltrated independently both the rodent and human genomes. The
mariner element is represented by elements (MMAR1 in mouse and
HSMAR1 in human) that are 97% identical. The average substi-
tution level outside CpG sites of HSMAR1 is 8% and of MMAR1 is
22%, both well below the divergence of elements predating the
human–mouse speciation (Table 6).
Some of the above differences in the nature of interspersed
repeats in human and mouse could reﬂect systematic factors in
mouse and human biology, whereas others may represent random
ﬂuctuations. Deeper understanding of the biology of transposable
elements and detailed knowledge of interspersed repeat populations
in other mammals should clarify these issues.
Similar repeats accumulate in orthologous locations
One of the most notable features about repeat elements is the
contrast in the genomic distribution of LINEs and SINEs. Whereas
LINEs are strongly biased towards (AþT)-rich regions, SINEs are
strongly biased towards (GþC)-rich regions. The contrast is all the
more notable because both elements are inserted into the genome
through the action of the same endonuclease126,127.
Such preferences were studied in detail in the initial analysis of
the human genome1, and essentially equivalent preferences are seen
in the mouse genome (Fig. 11). With the availability of two
mammalian genomes, however, it is possible to extend this analysis
to explore whether (AþT) and (GþC) content are truly causative
factors or merely reﬂections of an underlying biological process.
Towards that end, we studied the insertion of lineage-speciﬁc
repeat elements in orthologous segments in the human and mouse

genomes (Fig. 12). Each insertion represents a new, independent
event occurring in one lineage, and thus any correlation between the
two species reﬂects underlying proclivity to insert or retain repeats
in particular regions. Visual inspection reveals a strong correlation
in the sites of lineage-speciﬁc repeats of the various classes (Fig. 12).
Lineage-speciﬁc repeats also correlate with other genomic features,
as discussed in the section on genome evolution.
The correlation of local lineage-speciﬁc SINE density is extremely
strong (Fig. 13a). Moreover, local SINE density in one species is
better predicted by SINE density in the other species than it is by
local (GþC) content (Table 7). The local density of each distinct
rodent-speciﬁc type of SINE is a strong predictor of Alu density at
the orthologous locus in human, although the Alu equivalent B1
SINEs show the strongest correlation (r2 ¼ 0.784) (Table 7).
We interpret these results to mean that SINE density is inﬂuenced
by genomic features that are correlated with (GþC) content but that
are distinct from (GþC) content per se. The fact that (GþC) content
alone does not determine SINE density is consistent with the
observation that some (GþC)-rich regions of the human genome
are not Alu rich128,129.
Lineage-speciﬁc LINE density is also clearly correlated between
mouse and human (Fig. 13b), although the relationship does not
seem to be linear and it is not as strong (Spearman rank analysis,
r2 ¼ 0.45). (GþC) content seems to contribute as an independent
variable (increasing r2 to 0.52), suggesting that (GþC) content itself
directly affects LINE integration.
Genomic outliers
In addition to examining the general correlation in repeat density
between mouse and human, we also considered some of the extreme
examples. In the human genome, the four homeobox clusters
(HOXA, HOXB, HOXC and HOXD) are by far the most repeat-
poor regions of the human genome, with repeat content in the range
of 1%. These same four regions are exceptions in the mouse genome
as well. The strong selective constraints against insertion in these
regions probably reﬂect dense, long-range regulatory information
across this developmentally important gene cluster. Other repeat-
poor loci in the human genome1 (about 100-kb regions on human
chromosomes 1p36, 8q21 and 18q22) have independently remained
repeat-poor in mouse (3.6, 6.5 and 7%, respectively) over roughly
75 million years of evolution; we speculate that this similarly reﬂects
dense regulatory information in the region.
Conversely, we searched the mouse genome for repeat-poor
regions of at least 100 kb. Again, the outliers show a clear tendency
to be repeat-poor in human (see Supplementary Information). A
notable feature is that in half of the selected loci the repeat-poor
region is conﬁned almost exactly to the extent of a single gene.
Figure 14 shows this for the Zfhx1b locus, and also shows coinci-
dence of exclusion of interspersed repeats with high conservation
between human and mouse.
Figure 11 Density of interspersed repeat classes at different (GþC) content in the mouse
(a) and human (b) genomes. In both species, there is a strong increase in SINE density and
a decrease in L1 density with increasing (GþC) content, with the latter particularly marked
in the mouse. Another notable contrast is that in mouse, overall interspersed repeat
density gradually decreases 2.5-fold with increasing (GþC) content, whereas in human
the overall repeat density remains quite uniform. This reﬂects both the abundance of L1
elements in the mouse (GþC)-poor regions and the unusually high density of Alu in
human (GþC)-rich regions.
Figure 12 Conservation of (GþC) content and convergence of interspersed repeat
distribution between the human and mouse genomes. For each mouse chromosome, its
(GþC) content is depicted as a greyscale (centre, right), with darker shades indicating
(GþC)-richer regions. Rodent-speciﬁc repeats are shown as cumulative histograms (far
right), with red, green and blue indicating SINEs, LINEs and other repeats, respectively.
The (GþC) content of the orthologous human sequence is similarly shown (centre, left) as
well as the primate-speciﬁc repeats (far left). Gaps in the human sequence appear
opposite those regions of the mouse genome lacking assigned conserved syntenic
segments. Note the correlation in (GþC) and repeat content between orthologous regions
of the two genomes. Many abrupt shifts in (GþC) content and repeat density are clearly
associated with syntenic breaks, which are therefore more likely to be breaks associated
with the rodent lineage45.

LINE elements prefer sex chromosomes
A conspicuous feature of the repeat distribution is that LINE
elements in both human and mouse show a preference for accumu-
lating on sex chromosomes (Figs 12 and 15). Mouse chromosome X
contains almost twice the density of lineage-speciﬁc L1 copies as the
mouse autosomes (28.5% compared with 14.6%). Human sex
chromosomes show an even stronger bias (17.5% on X and 18.0%
on Y compared with 7.5% for the autosomes). The enrichment is
still highly signiﬁcant even after accounting for the generally higher
(AþT) content of the sex chromosomes (Fig. 15).
The higher density of L1 on sex chromosomes had been noted in
early hybridization experiments130,131 and has led to the suggestion
that L1 copies may help facilitate X inactivation132,133. For chromo-
some Y, the accumulation probably reﬂects a greater tolerance for
insertion (owing to the paucity of genes) and the inability to purge
deleterious mutations by recombination. Consistent with the latter
explanation, chromosome Yalso shows a threefold higher density of
full-length L1 copies (which are rapidly eliminated elsewhere in the
genome134) and an overall excess of LTR element insertions.
Chromosome X shows an excess of L1 copies, but not a marked
excess of either full-length L1 or LTR copies. The explanation for
this preferential accumulation of L1 elements on chromosome X in
both the mouse and human lineages remains unclear.
Simple sequence repeats
Mammalian genomes are scattered with simple sequence repeats
(SSRs), consisting of short perfect or near-perfect tandem repeats
that presumably arise through slippage during DNA replication.
SSRs have had a particularly important role as genetic markers in
linkage studies in both mouse and human, because their lengths tend
to be polymorphic in populations and can be readily assayed by
PCR. It is possible that such SSRs, arising as they do through
replication errors, would be largely equivalent between mouse and
human; however, there are impressive differences between the two
species135.

regions. SINE and LINE densities were calculated for 4,126 orthologous pairs with a

and both the Alu-like B1 SINEs (a) and the unrelated B2 SINEs (b) densities in mouse.
These correlations are stronger than the correlation of SINE density with (GþC) level (c). d,
The relationship of LINE1 density in human and mouse orthologous regions is not linear,
reﬂecting the more extreme bias of LINE1 for (AþT)-rich DNA in mouse.

Overall, mouse has 2.25–3.25-fold more short SSRs (1–5 bp unit)
than human (Table 8); the precise ratio depends on the percentage
identity required in deﬁning a tandem repeat. The mouse seems to
represent an exception among mammals on the basis of comparison
with the small amount of genomic sequence available from dog
(4 Mb) and pig (5 Mb), both of which show proportions closer to
human136 (E. Green, unpublished data; Table 8).
The analysis can be reﬁned, however, by excluding transposable
elements that contain SSRs at their 3
0 ends. For example, 90% of
A-rich SSRs in human are provided by or spawned from poly(A)
tails of Alu and L1 elements, and 15% of (CA)n-like SSRs in mouse
are contained in B2 element tails. When these sources are elimi-
nated, the contrast between mouse and human grows to roughly
fourfold.
The reason for the greater density of SSRs in mouse is unknown.
Table 9 shows that SSRs of .20 bp are not only more frequent, but
are generally also longer in the mouse than in the human genome,
suggesting that this difference is due to extension rather than to
initiation. The equilibrium distribution of SSR length has been
proposed137 to be determined by slippage between exact copies of
the repeat during meiotic recombination138. The shorter lengths of
SSRs in human may result from the higher rate of point substi-
tutions per generation (see above), which disrupts the exactness of
the repeats.
Apart from the absolute number of SSRs, there are also some
marked differences in the frequency of certain SSR classes (Table
9)136. The most extreme is the tetramer (ACAG)n, which is 20-fold
more common in mouse than human (even after eliminating copies
associated with B2 and B4 SINEs); the sequence does not occur in
large clusters, but rather is distributed throughout the genome. In
general, SSRs in which one strand is a polypurine tract and the other
a polypyrimidine tract are much more common and extended in
mouse than human. For the six such di-, tri- and tetramer SSRs (AG,
AAG, AGG, AAAG, AAGG, AGGG), copies with at least 20 bp and
95% identity are 1.6-fold longer and tenfold more common in
mouse than human.
Analysis of the distribution of SSRs across chromosomes also
reveals an interesting feature common to both organisms (see
Supplementary Information). In both human and mouse, there is
a nearly twofold increase in density of SSRs near the distal ends of
chromosome arms. Because mouse chromosomes are acrocentric,
they show the effect only at one end. The increased density of SSRs
in telomeric regions may reﬂect the tendency towards higher
recombination rates in subtelomeric regions1.
Mouse genes
Genes comprise only a small portion of the mammalian genome,
but they are understandably the focus of greatest interest. One of the
most notable ﬁndings of the initial sequencing and analysis of the
human genome1 was that the number of protein-coding genes was
only in the range of 30,000–40,000, far less than the widely cited
textbook ﬁgure of 100,000, but in accord with more recent, rigorous
estimates55,139–141. The lower gene count was based on the observed
and predicted gene counts, statistically adjusted for systematic
under- and overcounting.
Our goal here is to produce an improved catalogue of mamma-
lian protein-coding genes and to revisit the gene count. Genome
analysis has been enhanced by a number of recent developments.
These include burgeoning mammalian EST and cDNA collections,
knowledge of the genomes and proteomes of a growing number of
organisms, increasingly complete coverage of the mouse and human
genomes in high-quality sequence assemblies, and the ability to use
de novo gene prediction methodologies that exploit information
from two mammalian genomes to avoid potential biases inherent in
using known transcripts or homology to known genes.
We focus here on protein-coding genes, because the ability to
recognize new RNA genes remains rudimentary. As used below, the
terms ‘gene catalogue’ and ‘gene count’ refer to protein-coding
genes only. We brieﬂy discuss RNA genes at the end of the section.
Evidence-based gene prediction
We constructed catalogues of human and mouse gene predictions
on the basis of available experimental evidence. The main compu-
tational tool was the Ensembl gene prediction pipeline142 augmen-
ted with the Genie gene prediction pipeline143. Brieﬂy, the Ensembl

assembly, and too little clone-based information is available to be included. a, The
number of lineage-speciﬁc L1 copies per megabase declines 13- to 20-fold from lowest
to highest (GþC) content. This relationship is stronger in mouse and on the sex
chromosomes. Note that, for the same (GþC) content, L1 density is 1.5- to twofold
higher on the sex chromosomes. b, The average length of lineage-speciﬁc L1 copies
peaks at around the 39% (GþC) level, where it is three- (human) to fourfold (mouse)
higher than in the (GþC)-richest regions. The average length in mouse is underestimated
owing to the bias against full-length young elements in the shotgun assembly. On
average, L1 copies are longer on human Y than on either X chromosome or the
autosomes.

system uses three tiers of input. First, known protein-coding cDNAs
are mapped onto the genome. Second, additional protein-coding
genes are predicted on the basis of similarity to proteins in any
organism using the GeneWise program144. Third, de novo gene
predictions from the GENSCAN program145 that are supported by
experimental evidence (such as ESTs) are considered. These three
strands of evidence are reconciled into a single gene catalogue by
using heuristics to merge overlapping predictions, detect pseudo-
genes and discard misassemblies. These results are then augmented
by using conservative predictions from the Genie system, which
predicts gene structures in the genomic regions delimited by paired
5
0 and 3
0 ESTs on the basis of cDNA and EST information from the
region.
We also examined predictions from a variety of other compu-
tational systems (see Supplementary Information). These methods
tended to have signiﬁcant overlap with the above-generated gene
catalogues, but each tended to introduce signiﬁcant numbers of
predictions that were unsupported by other methods and that
appeared to be false positives. Accordingly, we did not add these
predictions to our gene catalogues; however, we did use them to ﬁll
in missing exons in existing predictions (see Supplementary Infor-
mation).
The computational pipeline produces predicted transcripts,
which may represent fragmentary products or alternative products
of a gene. They may also represent pseudogenes, which can be
difﬁcult in some cases to distinguish from real genes. The predicted
transcripts are then aggregated into predicted genes on the basis of
sequence overlaps (see Supplementary Information). The compu-
tational pipeline remains imperfect and the predictions are
tentative.
Initial and current human gene catalogue
The initial human gene catalogue1 contained about 45,000 pre-
dicted transcripts, which were aggregated into about 32,000 pre-
dicted genes containing a total of approximately 170,000 distinct
exons (Table 10). Many of the predicted transcripts clearly rep-
resented only gene fragments, because the overall set contained
considerably fewer exons per gene (mean 4.3, median 3) than
known full-length human genes (mean 10.2, median 8).
This initial gene catalogue was used to estimate the number of
human protein-coding genes, on the basis of estimates of the
fragmentation rate, false positive rate and false negative rate for
true human genes. Such corrections were particularly important,
because a typical human gene was represented in the predictions by
about half of its coding sequence or was signiﬁcantly fragmented.
The analysis suggested that the roughly 32,000 predicted genes
represented about 24,500 actual human genes (on the basis of
fragmentation and false positive rates) out of the best-estimate
total of approximately 31,000 human protein-coding genes on the
basis of estimated false negatives1. We suggested a range of 30,000–
40,000 to allow for additional genes.
Several papers have re-analysed the initial gene catalogue and
argued for a substantially larger human gene count146,147. Most of
these analyses, however, did not account for the incomplete nature
of the catalogoue148, the complexities arising from alternative
splicing, and the difﬁculty of interpreting evidence from fragmen-
tary messenger RNAs (such as ESTs and serial analysis of gene
expression (SAGE) tags) that may not represent protein-coding
genes149.
Since the initial paper1, the human gene catalogue has been
reﬁned as sequence becomes more complete and methods are

revised. The current catalogue (Ensembl build 29) contains 27,049
predicted transcripts aggregated into 22,808 predicted genes con-
taining about 199,000 distinct exons (Table 10). The predicted
transcripts are larger, with the mean number of exons roughly
doubling (to 8.7), and the catalogue has increased in completeness,
with the total number of exons increasing by nearly 20%. We return
below to the issue of estimating the mammalian gene count.
Mouse gene catalogue
We sought to create a mouse gene catalogue using the same
methodology as that used for the human gene catalogue
(Table 10). An initial catalogue was created by using the same
evidence set as for the human analysis, including cDNAs and
proteins from various organisms. This set included a previously
published collection of mouse cDNAs produced at the RIKEN
Genome Center41.
We also created an extended mouse gene catalogue by including a
much larger set of about 32,000 mouse cDNAs with signiﬁcant
ORFs (see Supplementary Information) that were sequenced by
RIKEN (see ref. 150). These additional mouse cDNAs improved the
catalogue by increasing the average transcript length through the
addition of exons (raising the total from about 191,000 to about
213,000, including many from untranslated regions) and by joining
fragmented transcripts. The set contributed roughly 1,200 new
predicted genes. The total number of predicted genes did not
change signiﬁcantly, however, because the increase was offset by a
decrease due to mergers of predicted genes. These mouse cDNAs
have not yet been used to extend the human gene catalogue.
Accordingly, comparisons of the mouse and human gene catalogues
below use the initial mouse gene catalogue.
The extended mouse gene catalogue contains 29,201 predicted
transcripts, corresponding to 22,011 predicted genes that contain
about 213,500 distinct exons. These include 12,226 transcripts
corresponding to cDNAs in the public databases, with 7,481 of
these in the well-curated RefSeq collection151. There are 9,785
predicted transcripts that do not correspond to known cDNAs,
but these are built on the basis of similarity to known proteins.
The new mouse and human gene catalogues contain many new
genes not previously identiﬁed in either genome. These include new
paralogues for genes responsible for at least ﬁve diseases: RFX5,
responsible for a type of severe combined immunodeﬁciency
resulting from lack of expression of human leukocyte antigen
(HLA) antigens on certain haematopoietic cells152; bestrophin,
responsible for a form of muscular degeneration153; otoferlin,
responsible for a non-syndromic prelingual deafness154; Crumbs1,
mutated in two inherited eye disorders155,156; and adiponectin, a
deﬁciency of which leads to diet-induced insulin resistance in
mice157. The RFX5 case is interesting, because disruption of the
known mouse homologue alone does not reproduce the human
disease, but may do so in conjunction with disruption of the newly
identiﬁed paralogue158.
Recently, Mural and colleagues45 analysed the sequence of mouse
chromosome 16 and reported 731 gene predictions (compared with
756 gene predictions in our set for chromosome 16). Our gene
catalogue contains 656 of these gene predictions, indicating exten-
sive agreement between these two independent analyses. Most of the
remaining 75 genes reported by ref. 45 seem to be systematic errors
(common to all such programs), such as relatively short gene
predictions arising from protein matches to low-complexity
regions.
It should be emphasized that the human and mouse gene
catalogues, although increasingly complete, remain imperfect.
Both genome sequences are still incomplete. Some authentic
genes are missing, fragmented or otherwise incorrectly described,
and some predicted genes are pseudogenes or are otherwise spu-
rious. We describe below further analysis of these challenges.
Pseudogenes
An important issue in annotating mammalian genomes is dis-
tinguishing real genes from pseudogenes, that is, inactive gene
copies. Processed pseudogenes arise through retrotransposition of
spliced or partially spliced mRNA into the genome; they are often
recognized by the loss of some or all introns relative to other copies
of the gene. Unprocessed pseudogenes arise from duplication of
genomic regions or from the degeneration of an extant gene that has
been released from selection. They sometimes contain all exons, but
often have suffered deletions and rearrangements that may make it
difﬁcult to recognize their precise parentage. Over time, pseudo-
genes of either class tend to accumulate mutations that clearly reveal
them to be inactive, such as multiple frameshifts or stop codons.
More generally, they acquire a larger ratio of non-synonymous to
synonymous substitutions (KA/KS ratio; see section on proteins
below) than functional genes. These features can sometimes be used
to recognize pseudogenes, although relatively recent pseudogenes
may escape such ﬁlters.
The well-studied Gapdh gene and its pseudogenes illustrate the
challenges159. The mouse genome contains only a single functional
Gapdh gene (on chromosome 7), but we ﬁnd evidence for at least
400 pseudogenes distributed across 19 of the mouse chromosomes.
Some of these are readily identiﬁed as pseudogenes, but 118 have
retained enough genic structure that they appear as predicted genes
in our gene catalogue. They were identiﬁed as pseudogenes only
after manual inspection. The Gapdh pseudogenes typically have no
orthologous human gene in the corresponding region of conserved
synteny.
To assess the impact of pseudogenes on gene prediction, we
focused on two classes of gene predictions: (1) those that lack a
corresponding gene prediction in the region of conserved synteny in
the human genome (2,705); and (2) those that are members of
apparent local gene clusters and that lack a reciprocal best match in
the human genome (5,143). A random sample of 100 such predicted
genes was selected, and the predictions were manually reviewed. We
estimate that about 76% of the ﬁrst class and about 30% of the
second class correspond to pseudogenes. Overall, this would corre-
spond to roughly 4,000 of the predicted genes in mouse. (A similar
proportion of gene predictions on chromosome 16 by Mural and
colleagues45 seem, by the same criteria, to be pseudogenes.) These
two classes contain relatively few exons (average 3), and thus
comprise only about 12,000 exons of the 213,562 in the mouse
gene catalogue. Pseudogenes similarly arise among human gene
predictions and are greatly enriched in the two classes above. This
analysis shows the beneﬁt of comparative genome analysis and
suggests ways to improve gene prediction.
We also sought to identify the many additional pseudogenes that
had been correctly excluded during the gene prediction process. To
do so, we searched the genomic regions lying outside the predicted
genes in the current catalogue for sequence with signiﬁcant simi-
larity to known proteins. We identiﬁed about 14,000 intergenic
regions containing such putative pseudogenes. Most (.95%)
appear to be clear pseudogenes (on the basis of such tests as ratio
of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions; see Supplemen-
tary Information and the section on proteins below), with more
than half being processed pseudogenes. This is surely an under-
estimate of the total number of pseudogenes, owing to the limited
sensitivity of the search.
Further reﬁnement
We analysed the mouse gene predictions further, focusing on those
whose best human match fell outside the region of conserved
synteny and those without clear orthologues in the human genome.
Two suspicious classes were identiﬁed. The ﬁrst (0.4%) consists of
63 predicted genes that seem to encode Gag/Pol proteins from
mouse-speciﬁc retrovirus elements. The second (about 2.5%) con-
sists of 591 predicted genes for which the only supporting evidence

comes from a single collection of mouse cDNAs (the initial RIKEN
cDNAs41). These cDNAs are very short on average, with few exons
(median 2) and small ORFs (average length of 85 amino acids);
whereas some of these may be true genes, most seem unlikely to
reﬂect true protein-coding genes, although they may correspond to
RNA genes or other kinds of transcripts. Both groups were omitted
in the comparative analysis below.
Comparison of mouse and human gene sets
We then sought to assess the extent of correspondence between the
mouse and human gene sets. Approximately 99% of mouse genes
have a homologue in the human genome. For 96% the homologue
lies within a similar conserved syntenic interval in the human
genome. For 80% of mouse genes, the best match in the human
genome in turn has its best match against that same mouse gene in
the conserved syntenic interval. These latter cases probably rep-
resent genes that have descended from the same common ancestral
gene, termed here 1:1 orthologues.
Comprehensive identiﬁcation of all orthologous gene relation-
ships, however, is challenging. If a single ancestral gene gives rise to a
gene family subsequent to the divergence of the species, the family
members in each species are all orthologous to the corresponding
gene or genes in the other species. Accordingly, orthology need not
be a 1:1 relationship and can sometimes be difﬁcult to discern from
paralogy (see protein section below concerning lineage-speciﬁc
gene family expansion).
There was no homologous predicted gene in human for less than
1% (118) of the predicted genes in mouse. In all these cases, the
mouse gene prediction was supported by clear protein similarity in
other organisms, but a corresponding homologue was not found in
the human genome. The homologous genes may have been deleted
in the human genome for these few cases, or they could represent
the creation of new lineage-speciﬁc genes in the rodent lineage—this
seems unlikely, because they show protein similarity to genes in
other organisms. There are, however, several other possible reasons
why this small set of mouse genes lack a human homologue. The
gene predictions themselves or the evidence on which they are based
may be incorrect. Genes that seem to be mouse-speciﬁc may
correspond to human genes that are still missing owing to the
incompleteness of the available human genome sequence. Alterna-
tively, there may be true human homologues present in the available
sequence, but the genes could be evolving rapidly in one or both
lineages and thus be difﬁcult to recognize. The answers should
become clear as the human genome sequence is completed and
other mammalian genomes are sequenced. In any case, the small
number of possible mouse-speciﬁc genes demonstrates that de novo
gene addition in the mouse lineage and gene deletion in the human
lineage have not signiﬁcantly altered the gene repertoire.
Mammalian gene count
To re-estimate the number of mammalian protein-coding genes, we
studied the extent to which exons in the new set of mouse cDNAs
sequenced by RIKEN132 were already represented in the set of exons
contained in our initial mouse gene catalogue, which did not use
this set as evidence in gene prediction. This cDNA collection is a
much broader and deeper survey of mammalian cDNAs than
previously available, on the basis of sampling of diverse embryonic
and adult tissues150. If the RIKEN cDNAs are assumed to represent a
random sampling of mouse genes, the completeness of our exon
catalogue can be estimated from the overlap with the RIKEN
cDNAs. We recognize this assumption is not strictly valid but
nonetheless is a reasonable starting point.
The initial mouse gene catalogue of 191,290 predicted exons
included 79% of the exons revealed by the RIKEN set. This is an
upper bound of sensitivity as some RIKEN cDNAs are probably less
than full length and many tissues remain to be sampled. On the basis
of the fraction of mouse exons with human counterparts, the
percentage of true exons among all predicted exons or the speciﬁcity
of the initial mouse gene catalogue is estimated to be 93%. Together,
these estimates suggest a count of about 225,189 exons in protein-
coding genes in mouse (191,290 £ 0.93/0.79).
To estimate the number of genes in the genome, we used an exon-
level analysis because it is less sensitive to artefacts such as frag-
mentation and pseudogenes among the gene predictions. One can
estimate the number of genes by dividing the estimated number of
exons by a good estimate of the average number of exons per gene. A
typical mouse RefSeq transcript contains 8.3 coding exons per gene,
and alternative splicing adds a small number of exons per gene. The
estimated gene count would then be about 27,000 with 8.3 exons per
gene or about 25,000 with 9 exons per gene. If the sensitivity is only
70% (rather than 79%), the exon count rises to 254,142, yielding a
range of 28,000–30,500.
In the next section, we show that gene predictions that avoid
many of the biases of evidence-based gene prediction result in only a
modest increase in the predicted gene count (in the range of about
1,000 genes). Together, these estimates suggest that the mammalian
gene count may fall at the lower end of (or perhaps below) our
previous prediction of 30,000–40,000 based on the human draft
sequence1. Although small, single-exon genes may add further to the
count, the total seems unlikely to greatly exceed 30,000. This lower
estimate for the mammalian gene number is consistent with other
recent extrapolations141. However, there are important caveats. It is
possible that the genome contains many additional small, single-
exon genes expressed at relatively low levels. Such genes would be
hard to detect by our various techniques and would also decrease
the average number of exons per gene used in the analysis above.
De novo gene prediction
The gene predictions above have the strength of being based on
experimental evidence but the weakness of being unable to detect
new exons without support from known transcripts or homology to
known cDNAs or ESTs in some organism. In particular, genes that
are expressed at very low levels or that are evolving very rapidly are
less likely to be present in the catalogue (R. Guigo´, unpublished
data).
Ideally, one would like to perform de novo gene prediction
directly from genomic sequence by recognizing statistical properties
of coding regions, splice sites, introns and other gene features.
Although this approachworks relatively well for small genomes with
a high proportion of coding sequence, it has much lower speciﬁcity
when applied to mammalian genomes in which coding sequences
are sparser. Even the best de novo gene prediction programs (such as
GENSCAN145) predict many apparently false-positive exons.
In principle, de novo gene prediction can be improved by
analysing aligned sequences from two related genomes to increase
the signal-to-noise ratio135. Gene features (such as splice sites) that
are conserved in both species can be given special credence, and
partial gene models (such as pairs of adjacent exons) that fail to have
counterparts in both species can be ﬁltered out. Together, these
techniques can increase sensitivity and speciﬁcity.
We developed three new computer programs for dual-genome
de novo gene prediction: TWINSCAN160,325, SGP2 (refs 161, 326)
and SLAM162. We describe here results from the ﬁrst two programs.
The results of the SLAM analysis can be viewed at http://bio.math.
berkeley.edu/slam/mouse/. To predict genes in the mouse genome,
these two programs ﬁrst ﬁnd the highest-scoring local mouse–
human alignment (if any) in the human genome. They then search
for potential exonic features, modifying the probability scores for
the features according to the presence and quality of these human
alignments. We ﬁltered the initial predictions of these programs,
retaining only multi-exon gene predictions for which there were
corresponding consecutive exons with an intron in an aligned
position in both species327.
After enrichment based on the presence of introns in aligned

locations, TWINSCAN identiﬁed 145,734 exons as being part of
17,271 multi-exon genes. Most of the gene predictions (about 94%)
were present in the above evidence-based gene catalogue. Conver-
sely, about 78% of the predicted genes and about 81% of the exons
in this catalogue were at least partially represented by TWINSCAN
predictions. TWINSCAN predicted an extra 4,558 (3%) new exons
not predicted by the evidence-based methods. SGP2 produced
qualitatively similar results. The total number of predicted exons
was 168,492 contained in 18,056 multi-exon genes, with 86% of the
predicted genes in the evidence-based gene catalogue at least
partially represented. Approximately 83% of the exons in the
catalogue were detected by SGP2, which predicted an additional
9,808 (6%) new exons. There is considerable overlap between the
two sets of new predicted exons, with the TWINSCAN predictions
largely being a subset of the SGP2 predictions; the union of the two
sets contains 11,966 new exons.
We attempted to validate a sample of 214 of the new predictions
by performing PCR with reverse transcription (RT) between
consecutive exons using RNA from 12 adult mouse tissues163
and verifying resulting PCR products by direct DNA sequencing.
Our sampling involved selecting gene predictions without nearby
evidence-based predictions on the same strand and with an intron
of at least 1 kb. The validation rate was approximately 83% for
TWINSCAN and about 44% for SGP2 (which had about twice as
many new exons; see above). Extrapolating from these success rates,
we estimate that the entire collection would yield about 788
validated gene predictions that do not overlap with the evidence-
based catalogue.
The second step of ﬁltering de novo gene predictions (by requiring
the presence of adjacent exons in both species) turns out to greatly
increase prediction speciﬁcity. Predicted genes that were removed
by this criterion had a very low validation rate. In a sample of 101
predictions that failed to meet the criteria, the validation rate was
11% for genes with strong homology to human sequence and 3%
for those without. The ﬁltering process thus removed 24-fold more
apparent false positives than true positives. Extrapolating from
these results, testing the entire set of such predicted genes (that is,
those that fail the test of having adjacent homologous exons in the
two species) would be expected to yield only about 231 additional
validated predictions.
Overall, we expect that about 1,000 (788þ231) of the new gene
predictions would be validated by RT–PCR. This probably corre-
sponds to a smaller number of actual new genes, because some of
these may belong to the same transcription unit as an adjacent de
novo or evidence-based prediction. Conversely, some true genes
may fail to have been detected by RT–PCR owing to lack of
sensitivity or tissue, or developmental stage selection327.
An example of a new gene prediction, validated by RT–PCR, is a
homologue of dystrophin (Fig. 16). Dystrophin is encoded by the
DMD gene, which is mutated in individuals with Duchenne
muscular dystrophy164. A gene prediction was found on mouse
chromosome 1 and human chromosome 2, showing 38% amino
acid identity over 36% of the dystrophin protein (the carboxy
terminal portion, which interacts with the transmembrane protein
b-dystroglycan). Other new gene predictions include homologues
of aquaporin. These gene predictions were missed by the evidence-
based methods because they were below various thresholds. These
and other examples are described in a companion paper327.
The overall results of the de novo gene prediction are encouraging
in two respects. First, the results show that de novo gene prediction
on the basis of two genome sequences can identify (at least partly)
most predicted genes in the current mammalian gene catalogues
with remarkably high speciﬁcity and without any information
about cDNAs, ESTs or protein homologies from other organisms.
It can also identify some additional genes not detected in the
evidence-based analysis. Second, the results suggest that methods
that avoid some of the inherent biases of evidence-based gene
prediction do not identify more than a few thousand additional
predicted exons or genes. These results are thus consistent with an
estimate in the vicinity of 30,000 genes, subject to the uncertainties
noted above.
RNA genes
The genome also encodes many RNAs that do not encode proteins,
including abundant RNAs involved in mRNA processing and
translation (such as ribosomal RNAs and tRNAs), and more
recently discovered RNAs involved in the regulation of gene
expression and other functions (such as micro RNAs)165,166. There
are probably many new RNAs not yet discovered, but their com-
putational identiﬁcation has been difﬁcult because they contain few
hallmarks. Genomic comparisons have the potential to signiﬁcantly
increase the power of such predictions by using conservation to
reveal relatively weak signals, such as those arising from RNA
secondary structure167. We illustrate this by showing how compara-
tive genomics can improve the recognition of even an extremely well
understood gene family, the tRNA genes.
In our initial analysis of the human genome1, the program
tRNAscan-SE168 predicted 518 tRNA genes and 118 pseudogenes.
A small number (about 25 of the total) were ﬁltered out by the
RepeatMasker program as being fossils of the MIR transposon, a
long-dead SINE element that was derived from a tRNA169,170.
The analysis of the mouse genome is much more challenging
because the mouse contains an active SINE (B2) that is derived from
a tRNA and thus vastly complicates the task of identifying true
tRNA genes. The tRNAscan-SE program predicted 2,764 tRNA
genes and 22,314 pseudogenes in mouse, but the RepeatMasker
program classiﬁed 2,266 of the ‘genes’ and 22,136 of the ‘pseudo-
genes’ as SINEs. After eliminating these, the remaining set con-
tained 498 putative tRNA genes. Close analysis of this set suggested
that it was still contaminated with a substantial number of pseudo-
genes. Speciﬁcally, 19 of the putative tRNA genes violated the
wobble rules that specify that only 45 distinct anticodons are
expected to decode the 61 standard sense codons, plus a seleno-
cysteine tRNA species complementary to the UGA stop codon171. In
contrast, the initial analysis of the human genome identiﬁed only
three putative tRNA genes that violated the wobble rules172,173.
To improve discrimination of functional tRNA genes, we
exploited comparative genomic analysis of mouse and human.
True functional tRNA genes would be expected to be highly
conserved. Indeed, the 498 putative mouse tRNA genes differ on
average by less than 5% (four differences in about 75 bp) from their
nearest human match, and nearly half are identical. In contrast,
non-genic tRNA-related sequences (those labelled as pseudogenes
by tRNAscan-SE or as SINEs by RepeatMasker) differ by an average
of 38% and none is within 5% divergence. Notably, the 19 suspect
predictions that violate the wobble rules show an average of 26%

by RT–PCR from primers complementary to the ﬂanking exons followed by direct product
sequencing327. Regions of high-scoring alignment to the entire other genome (computed
before gene predictions and identiﬁcation of predicted orthologues) are shown in yellow.
Note the weak correspondence between predicted exons and blocks of high-scoring
whole-genome alignment. Nonetheless, the predicted proteins considered in isolation
show good alignment across several splice sites.

divergence from their nearest human homologue, and none is
within 5% divergence.
On the basis of these observations, we identiﬁed the set of tRNA
genes having cross-species homologues with ,5% sequence diver-
gence. The set contained 335 tRNA genes in mouse and 345 in
human. In both cases, the set represents all 46 expected anti-codons
and exactly satisﬁes the expected wobble rules. The sets probably
more closely represent the true complement of functional tRNA
genes.
Although the excluded putative genes (163 in mouse and 167 in
human) may include some true genes, it seems likely that our earlier
estimate of approximately 500 tRNA genes in human is an over-
estimate. The actual count in mouse and human is probably closer
to 350.
We also analysed the mouse genome for other known classes of
non-coding RNAs. Because many of these classes also seem to have
given rise to many pseudogenes, we conservatively considered only
those loci that are identical or that are highly similar to RNAs that
have been published as ‘true’ genes. We identiﬁed a total of 446 non-
coding RNA genes, which includes 121 small nucleolar RNAs, 78
micro RNAs, and 247 other non-coding RNA genes, including
rRNAs, spliceosomal RNAs, and telomerase RNA. We also classiﬁed
2,030 other loci with signiﬁcant similarities to known RNA genes as
probable pseudogenes.
Mouse proteome
Eukaryotic protein invention appears to have occurred largely
through two important mechanisms. The ﬁrst is the combination
of protein domains into new architectures. (Domains are compact
structures serving as evolutionarily conserved functional building
blocks that are often assembled in various arrangements (architec-
tures) in different proteins174.) The second is lineage-speciﬁc expan-
sions of gene families that often accompany the emergence of
lineage-speciﬁc functions and physiologies175 (for example, expan-
sions of the vertebrate immunoglobulin superfamily reﬂecting
the invention of the immune system1, receptor-like kinases in
A. thaliana associated with plant-speciﬁc self-incompatibility and
disease-resistance functions49, and the trypsin-like serine protease
homologues in D. melanogaster associated with dorsal–ventral
patterning and innate immune response176,177).
The availability of the human and mouse genome sequences
provides an opportunity to explore issues of protein evolution that
are best addressed through the study of more closely related
genomes. The great similarity of the two proteomes allows extensive
comparison of orthologous proteins (those that descended by
speciation from a single gene in the common ancestor rather than
by intragenome duplication), permitting an assessment of the
evolutionary pressures exerted on different classes of proteins.
The differences between the mouse and human proteomes, primar-
ily in gene family expansions, might reveal how physiological,
anatomical and behavioural differences are reﬂected at the genome
level.
Overall proteome comparison
We compared the largest transcript for each gene in the mouse gene
catalogue to the National Center for Biotechnology Information
Figure 17 Taxonomic breakdown of homologues of mouse proteins according to
taxonomic range. Note that only a small fraction of genes are possibly rodent-speciﬁc
(,1%) as compared with those shared with other mammals (14%, not rodent-speciﬁc);
shared with chordates (6%, not mammalian-speciﬁc); shared with metazoans (27%, not
chordate-speciﬁc); shared with eukaryotes (29%, not metazoan-speciﬁc); and shared
with prokaryotes and other organisms (23%, not eukaryotic-speciﬁc).
Figure 18 Gene ontology (GO) annotations for mouse and human proteins. The GO terms
assigned to mouse (blue) and human (red) proteins based on sequence matches to
InterPro domains are grouped into approximately a dozen categories. These categories
fell within each of the larger ontologies of cellular component (a) molecular function (b)
and biological process (c) (D. Hill, personal communication). In general, mouse has a
similar percentage of proteins compared with human in most categories. The apparently
signiﬁcant difference between the number of mouse and human proteins in the
translational apparatus category of the cellular component ontology may be due to
ribosomal protein pseudogenes incorrectly assigned as genes in mouse.

(NCBI) database (‘nr’set; ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/db/nr.z) using
the BLASTP program178. Mouse proteins predicted to be homol-
ogues (E , 1024) of other proteins were classiﬁed into one of six
taxonomic groupings: (1) rodent-speciﬁc; (2) mammalian-speciﬁc;
(3) chordate-speciﬁc; (4) metazoan-speciﬁc; (5) eukaryote-speciﬁc;
and (6) other (Fig. 17). The results were similar to those from an
analysis of human proteins1.
We annotated the current sets of mouse and human proteins with
respect to the InterPro classiﬁcation of domains, motifs and
proteins using the InterProScan computer resource179. In this way,
the proteins were assigned Gene Ontology (GO) codes180, which
describe biological process, cellular compartment and molecular
function. Comparisons of GO annotations between the two mam-
mals showed no large-scale differences in molecular and cellular
functions between the two protein sets (Fig. 18) that were not
accountable by imperfections in gene prediction and annotation.
Overall, about 72% of proteins contained at least one InterPro
domain.
As expected, most of the protein or domain families have similar
sizes in human and mouse (Table 11). However, 12 of the 50 most
populous InterPro families in mouse show signiﬁcant differences in
numbers between the two proteomes, most notably high mobility
group HMG1/2 box and ubiquitin domains. On close analysis, the
differences for six of these families can be accounted for by
differential expansion of endogenous retroviral sequences in the
genomes. We return below to the issue of expansion of gene families.
Evolution of orthologues
To study the evolutionary forces that conserve proteins, we exam-
ined the set of 12,845 1:1 orthologues between human and mouse
described above, expanding by nearly an order of magnitude the set
of 1:1 orthologues used for evolutionary analysis14,181. These are
genes for which lineage-speciﬁc duplications seem not to have
occurred in either lineage.
For each orthologous gene pair, we aligned the cDNA sequences
in accordance with their pairwise amino acid alignments and

The top 50 protein families/domains in mouse are listed, and for each genome the comparative values are shown as the percentage of total genes in the genome and, in parentheses, the relative rank in the
genome. This is based on InterProScan179 analysis of gene products with a signiﬁcant match to the InterPro collection of protein family and domain signatures. A conservative domain prediction scheme was
used that excluded uncertain matches, PROSITE patterns, PRINTS predictions, and two PROSITE proﬁles. Only signatures of the ‘family’, ‘domain’ and ‘repeat’ types were considered. In the case of
multiple annotated transcripts per gene, only the longest one was considered. Brieﬂy, all InterPro hierarchical relationships among signatures with different speciﬁcity were collapsed to the broadest
categories. InterPro entries in italic font represent families that have numerous members among transposons, endogenous retroviruses and pseudogenes. Signiﬁcant expansions in mouse compared
with human are marked in bold (P , 0.05 for chi-squared test on number of family/domain members with respect to total genes examined, using Dunn–Sidak corrections for multiple tests298).

calculated two measures of sequence evolution: the percentage of
amino acid identities and the KA/KS ratio182. The latter quantity
reﬂects the ratio between the rates of non-synonymous (amino-acid
replacing) mutations per non-synonymous site and synonymous
(silent) mutations per synonymous site (see ref. 183). Non-syno-
nymous mutations are typically subject to strong selective pressure,
whereas synonymous changes are thought typically to be neutral.
Orthologue pairs generally have low values of KA/KS (for example,
,0.05), which implies that the proteins are subject to relatively
strong purifying selection184. Proteins with KA/KS . 1 are formally
deﬁned as being subject to positive selection; that is, amino acid
changes are accumulating faster than would be expected given
the underlying silent substitution rate. However, proteins with
KA /KS , 1 may still contain sites under positive selection, but the
contribution of those sites to the KA /KS for the whole protein is
offset by purifying selection at other sites185. Some care is needed,
however, to exclude pseudogenes in such analyses. Because pseu-
dogenes do not encode functional proteins, the distinction between
synonymous and non-synonymous mutations is irrelevant and the
apparent KA /KS ratio will converge towards 1.
For the 12,845 pairs of mouse–human 1:1 orthologues, 70.1% of
the residues were identical. The median amino acid identity was
78.5% and the median KA /KS ratio was 0.115 (Fig. 19 and Table 12).
Most mouse and human orthologue pairs thus have a high degree of
sequence identity and are under strong-to-moderate purifying
selection. One consequence of the strong sequence similarity is
that computer programs such as PSI-BLAST178, that use iterative
alignment to detect distant homologues, gain little by using both
mouse and human sequence compared with using either genome
singly. For 4,344 human proteins for which no non-primate
homologue could be recognized on the basis of the human
sequence, the addition of a mouse orthologue added nothing new.
We sought to quantify the relative selective pressures on protein
regions containing known domains. About 65% of gene pairs
encode transcripts that contain at least one InterPro domain
prediction (we considered only predicted domains present in
corresponding positions in both orthologues). Regions containing
predicted domains had higher average percentage identities and
lower KA /KS values than regions without predicted domains or than
full-length proteins (Fig. 19 and Table 12). Thus, domains are under
greater purifying selection than are regions not containing domains.
This is consistent with the hypothesis that domains are under
greater structural and functional constraints than unstructured,
domain-free regions. In this analysis (as in those below), the
differences in KA /KS were largely due to variations in KA (Table
12). Median KS values clustered around 0.6 synonymous substi-
tutions per synonymous site (Table 12), indicating that each of the
sets of proteins has a similar neutral substitution rate. (These results
are broadly consistent with measures of neutral substitution rate
provided in the repeat and evolution sections, although the precise
methodologies used and categories of sites examined affect the
magnitude of estimates (see Supplementary Information).)
Figure 19 Protein evolution. The ﬁgure shows percentage residue identity and cumulative
non-synonymous to synonymous codon rate ratios for total proteins and for regions with
and without predicted InterPro domains, predicted SMART domains with or without known
enzymatic activity, and SMART domains speciﬁc to three different subcellular
compartments. The 12,845 orthologous gene pairs referred to in Table 12 were used for
analysis. a, Proteins were divided into regions with and without InterPro domains, and per
cent identity was calculated for total proteins (black) and for domain-containing (red line)
and domain-free (grey line) regions. The higher conservation of domain-containing
regions, relative to domain-free regions, is consistent with their greater functional
conservation. The protein sequences are plotted in bins of 4% identity. In calculating the
per cent amino acid identity between two sequences, the number of identical residues
was divided by the total number of alignment positions, including positions where one
sequence was aligned with a gap. b, Cumulative KA /KS ratios for total proteins (black line)
and for regions with (red line) and without (grey line) predicted Interpro domains. Protein-
domain-containing regions have low KA /KS ratios (,0.15), suggesting that they may be
subject to greater degrees of purifying selection than are the domain-free regions. The
differences in functional constraints between predicted domain regions and the rest of the
protein may be found to be even more pronounced, as a signiﬁcant proportion of
sequences may contain as yet unpredicted protein domains. c, Cumulative KA /KS ratios
for SMART domain predictions with (red line) or without (black line) known enzymatic
activity. The higher proportion of catalytic domains with low KA /KS ratios is an indication of
the greater purifying selection acting on these sequences. d, Cumulative KA /KS ratios for
predicted SMART domains that are speciﬁc to one of three different subcellular
compartments. Compared with intracellular (cytoplasmic (red) and nuclear (black))
domains, a greater proportion of secreted domains (grey) possess higher KA /KS values.
This indicates that secreted, often extracellular domains are subject, on average, to
greater positive diversifying selection.

We next considered how the molecular functions of domains
affect their evolution. Domain families with enzymatic activity were
found to have a lower KA /KS ratio than non-enzymatic domains
(Fig. 19 and Table 12). Fewer substitutions are thus tolerated in
catalytic regions, suggesting that a larger proportion of amino acids
contribute to substrate binding, speciﬁcity and catalysis in enzymes.
Although enzymatic domains are signiﬁcantly larger than non-
enzymatic domains (189 compared with 47 amino acids on aver-
age), analysis indicates that there is no signiﬁcant correlation
between domain length and KA /KS (r2 ¼ 0.002).
We also examined how rates of evolution correlate with the
cellular compartments in which a protein functions. We partitioned
521 of the 649 domain families in the SMART database186 into
secreted, cytoplasmic or nuclear classes on the basis of published
data187. The KA /KS values for the three classes showed that domains
in the secreted class typically are under less purifying selection than
are either nuclear or cytoplasmic domains (Fig. 19 and Table 11).
Of eight domain families with the highest (.0.15) median KA /KS
values, six are speciﬁc to the secreted portions of proteins and are
implicated in the mammalian defence and immune response system
(Table 13). The fact that these proteins have the highest KA/KS
values indicates that they are under reduced purifying selection,
increased positive selection, or both. Increased positive selection
may be the result of antagonistic coevolution between a mammalian
host and its pathogens in a ‘genetic arms race’188, where each is
under strong pressure to respond to innovations in the other
genome.
Mouse orthologues of human disease genes are of particular
interest to biomedical research. We examined 687 human disease
genes having clear orthologues in mouse189. A total of 7,293 amino
acid variants reported to be disease-associated190 were mapped to
corresponding positions in the mouse sequence. The mouse
sequence was identical to the normal human sequence for 90.3%
of these positions, and it differed from both the normal and disease-
associated sequence in human for 7.5% of the positions. To our
surprise, the mouse sequence was identical to the human disease-
associated sequence in a small number of cases (160, 2.2%).
Although the causal connection with disease has not yet been
proven in every one of these cases, there are at least 23 instances
where the link between disease and mutation has been documented
(Table 14). These include mutations in the cystic ﬁbrosis trans-
membrane conductance regulator gene and the a-synuclein gene,
which is associated with a familial form of Parkinson’s disease191. In
such cases, the mouse may not provide the most appropriate model
system for direct study of the mutation, although understanding the
basis for the species difference may prove enlightening.
We performed a similar analysis with SNPs in coding regions of
human genes. We found the location of 8,322 high-quality, coding-
region SNPs from HGVbase192 within human genes using the
tBLASTn computer program178 and, in turn, within the correspond-
ing positions in mouse orthologues. The mouse sequence encoded
the identical amino acid as the major (more common) human allele
in 67.1% of cases and as the minor human allele in 13.6% of cases.
The former proportion is similar to the 70.1% of human amino
acids that are conserved in mouse orthologues, indicating that most
of such coding-region SNPs are not under strong selective
constraint.
Evolution of gene families in mouse
As noted above, 80% of mouse proteins seem to have strict 1:1
orthologues in the human genome. Many of the remainder belong
to gene families that have undergone differential expansion in at
least one of the two genomes, resulting in the lack of a strict 1:1
relationship. Such gene family changes represent an insight into
aspects of physiology that have emerged since the last common
ancestor.

A well-documented example of family expansion is the olfactory
receptor gene family, which represents a branch of the larger G-
protein-coupled receptor superfamily tree193,194. Duplication of
olfactory receptor genes seems to have occurred frequently in
both rodent and primate lineages, and differences in number and
sequence have been seen as distinguishing the degrees and reper-
toires of odorant detection between mice and humans. Moreover,
an estimated 20% of the mouse olfactory receptor homologues194
and a higher percentage of human homologues195,196 are pseudo-
genes, indicating that there is a dynamic interplay between gene
birth and gene death in the recent evolution of this family. The
importance of these genes in reproductive behaviour is evident from
defects in pheromone responses that result from deletion of the VR1
vomeronasal olfactory receptor gene cluster197.
Another example is the cytochrome P450 gene family, which is of
considerable pharmacological and clinical interest. P450 cyto-
chromes are normally terminal oxidases in multicomponent elec-
tron transfer chains, which metabolize large numbers of xenobiotic
as well as endogenous compounds. Their numbers often vary
among different species198. This gene family is moderately but
signiﬁcantly expanded in mouse (84 genes) relative to human (63
genes). By comparing the cytochrome P450 gene families from
mouse, human and pufferﬁsh (Takifugu rubripes), we found clear
expansions in four subfamilies (Cyp2b, Cyp2c, Cyp2d and Cyp4a)
in mouse relative to human (Fig. 20). These occur in local gene
clusters that also contain unprocessed pseudogenes. The expansions
appear to be associated, in part, with gender differences in the
metabolism of androgens and xenobiotics (see below).
To explore systematically recent evolution of the mouse pro-
teome, we searched for mouse-speciﬁc gene clusters. We identiﬁed
genomic regions containing four or more homologous mouse genes
that descended from a single gene in the human–mouse common
ancestor; these represent local expansions in the mouse lineage. To
detect such clusters, we compared all transcripts of each gene with
those of ﬁve genes on either side (using the BLAST-2-Sequences
program with a threshold of E , 1024). A total of 4,563 mouse
genes were found to have at least one such homologue within this
window. A total of 147 such clusters containing at least four
homologues was identiﬁed, of which 47 contained multiple olfac-
tory receptor genes, which have been studied elsewhere193,199 and are
not discussed further here. For the remaining 100 clusters, we then
constructed dendrograms to examine the evolutionary relationship
among the mouse proteins and their human homologues. This
allowed us to identify those clusters containing mouse genes that are
descendants of a single ancestral gene or for which multiple gene
deletions had occurred in the human lineage.
In total, 25 such mouse-speciﬁc clusters were identiﬁed (Table 15;

the number of proteins, which is indicated by white-line subdivisions. Chromosomal
location in mouse is shown on each of the branches for each subfamily. The lengths of the
branches are not drawn to scale. Branches with signiﬁcant nodes (bootstrapping value
.0.7) are in black, with the remainder in blue. In 6 out of the 15 CYP2C family cases, the
localization of the genomic region from which they are derived remains unassigned.
b, Detailed phylogenetic tree of the CYP2C family based on the neighbour-joining method.
The root of the tree was determined using a CYP2A sequence as out-group. Eight out of
the 15 mouse CYP2C sequences are excluded in this tree as they are very short.
Sequence identiﬁers are coloured on the basis of their source: red, mouse; green, human.
Sequence identiﬁers followed by an asterisk indicate that the sequences contain either a
premature in-frame stop codon or frameshift. Bootstrap values are shown at the
branches. Colour codes of branches are as for a. Although the bootstrap value for the
branch containing CYP2C pseudogene2 and ENSP00000285979 is rather low (0.579), it
might seem that CYP2C pseudogene2 has only recently lost its function, as a putative
orthologue in human (ENSP00000285979) is still clustered with it.

see Supplementary Information). In most cases (16), the mouse-
speciﬁc cluster corresponds to only a single gene in the human
genome. Among these 25 clusters, two major functional themes
emerge: 14 contain genes involved in rodent reproduction and 5
contain genes involved in host defence and immunity. Each of the 14
‘reproduction’ clusters contains at least one gene whose expression
is modulated by androgens, is involved in the biosynthesis or
metabolism of hormones, has an established role in the placenta,
gonads or spermatozoa, or has documented roles in mate selection,
including pheromone olfaction (Table 15). The fact that so many of
the 25 clusters are related to reproduction is unlikely to
be coincidental. Many of the most pronounced physiological
differences between rodents and primates relate to reproduction,
including substantial variations in placental structures, litter sizes,
oestrous cycles and gestation periods. It seems likely that reproduc-
tive traits have been responsible for some of the most powerful
evolutionary pressures on the mouse genome, and that the demand
for innovation has been met through gene family expansions.
Examination of the human genome in this way may similarly reveal
gene clusters that reﬂect particular aspects of human reproduction.
Some of the clusters may be related to the principal differences
between mice and humans in placental structure. Although both
mouse and human have discoid placentae200,201, they differ in the
number and types of cell layers between the maternal and fetal
blood. Of the expanded gene families, the cathepsin cluster on
chromosome 13 and cystatins on chromosome 16 are expressed in
the placenta202,203 and may affect its development. A non-canonical
homeobox cluster on chromosome X includes Pem, Psx1 and Gpbox
(Psx2), which are all expressed in the placenta204–208.
Another cluster is related to a different specialized aspect of
reproductive physiology. This cluster, on chromosome 2, contains
seminal vesicle secretory proteins that are rapidly evolving, andro-
gen-regulated proteins involved in the formation of the copulatory
plug and inﬂuence the survival and efﬁcacy of spermatozoa209–211.
Other clusters are closely related to hormone metabolism and
response. These include clusters of prolactin-like genes on chromo-
some 13 (ref. 212), prolactin-inducible genes on chromosome 6
(refs 213, 214), 3-b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases on chromo-
some 3 (refs 215, 216), and cytochrome P450 Cypd genes on
chromosome 15 (refs 217, 218; see Table 15).
Several of the clusters are related to olfactory cues, which have
crucial roles in rodent reproduction. For example, the lipocalin-like
gene cluster on chromosome X encodes proteins that are proposed
to bind odorant molecules in the mucous layer overlying the
receptors of the vomeronasal organ219,220.
The salivary androgen-binding protein alpha (Abpa) pheromone
gene lies within a cluster on mouse chromosome 7 that contains
numerous highly related genes and pseudogenes. Males apply Abpa
to their pelts by licking and then deposit it on their surroundings
within their territory. In laboratory behavioural experiments,
female mice have been shown to have a mating preference for
males with a similar Abpa genotype, possibly to avoid inter-
subspecies breeding221,222. Consequently, Abpa has been proposed
to have a key role in the sexual isolation between M. musculus
subspecies. The hitherto unknown Abpa paralogues on chromo-
some 7 may represent evolutionary vestiges of previously function-
ing Abpa-like molecules and/or additional functional Abpa-like
pheromones.
Another notable cluster of probable pheromone genes was found
on chromosome X. Aphrodisin is an aphrodisiac pheromone of the
female hamster Cricetus cricetus that elicits copulatory behaviour
from males223. The mouse chromosome X cluster contains predicted
genes that are highly sequence-similar to aphrodisin and might
possess similar behavioural functions.
The ﬁve mouse clusters that encode genes involved in immunity
suggest that another major evolutionary force is acting on host
defence genes. The ﬁve clusters include the major histocompat-
ibility complex (MHC) class Ib genes, two clusters of antimicrobial
b-defensins, a cluster of WAP domain antimicrobial proteins and a
cluster of type A ribonucleases. Ribonuclease A genes appear to have
been under strong positive selection, possibly due to their signiﬁ-
cant role in host-defence mechanisms224. The mouse genome also
contains other interesting examples of recently expanded gene
clusters involved in immunity, which fall short of our strict
deﬁnition of mouse-speciﬁc clusters because small families consist-
ing of a few genes appear to have been present in the common
ancestor. Examples include the Ly6 and Ly49 gene families, which
are greatly expanded on chromosomes 15 and 6. The Ly49 genes are
of particular interest because equivalent functional niches are
occupied in humans and primates by a different gene family (the
non-homologous KIR family of natural killer cell receptors), an
instance of convergent functional evolution225,226.
The two major themes—reproduction and immunity—may not
be entirely unrelated; that is, the MHC class Ib genes have roles in
both pregnancy and immunity. MHC genotype is also known from
ethological studies to inﬂuence mate selection, although the mol-
ecular mechanisms underlying this effect remain unknown. Within
the MHC complex, the class I genes are the most divergent, having
arisen after the rodent–human divergence227.
The 25 mouse-speciﬁc clusters have been generated predomi-
nantly by local gene duplication. For 74% of genes in these clusters,
the most similar homologue in the mouse genome can be found
either in the same cluster or within ﬁve genes from that cluster. As
well as gene birth, the clusters bear witness to gene death: the Abpa,
P450 Cyp4a and Cyp4d cytochrome P450, and carboxylesterase
families all contain one or more predicted pseudogene.
Members of the clusters also seem to be undergoing rapid
sequence evolution, as measured by the KA /KS ratio (Fig. 21). The
relatively high values of KA /KS may reﬂect both positive selection
(as genes diverge to take up new function) and the accumulation of
mutations in moribund or dead genes. Previous studies have
documented rapid evolution for a number of these clusters, includ-
ing eosinophil-associated ribonucleases224, MHC class I227, class
Cyp2d cytochromes P450 (ref. 228), Abpa subunits221, the Gpbox
homeobox cluster204,206 and submandibular gland secretory and
proline-rich proteins229.
Genome evolution: selection
Investigation of the two principal forces that shape the evolution of
the mouse and human genomes—mutation and selection—requires
looking beyond coarse-scale identiﬁcation of regions of conserved
synteny and purely codon-based analysis of orthologues, to ﬁne-
scale alignment of the two genomes at the nucleotide level.
The substantial sequence divergence between the mouse and
human genomes is still low enough that orthologous sequences
undergoing neutral drift remain conserved enough for them to be
aligned reliably. The challenge then is to use such alignments to tease
apart the effects of neutral drift, which can teach us about under-
lying mutational processes, and selection, which can inform us
about functionally important elements. It should be emphasized
that sequence similarity alone does not imply functional constraint.
In this section, we use whole-genome alignments to explore the
extent of sequence conservation in neutral sites (such as ancestral
repeat sequences), known functional elements (such as coding
regions) and the genome as a whole. By comparing these, we are
able to estimate the proportion of regions of the mammalian
genome under evolutionary selection (about 5%), which far exceeds
the amount attributable to protein-coding sequences. In the next
section, we then use the neutral sites to study how mutational forces
vary across the genome.
Fine-scale alignment of genomes
We began by creating a catalogue of sequence alignments between
the mouse and human genomes. The alignments were produced by
articles

the BLASTZ328 program by comparing all non-repeat sequences
across the genome to identify all high-scoring matches (see Supple-
mentary Information; available for download at http://genome.
ucsc.edu/downloads.html), then, using these as seeds, we extended
the alignments into the surrounding regions, including into repeat
sequences. To make the catalogue as comprehensive as possible, a
given region in one genome was allowed to align to multiple,
possibly non-syntenically conserved regions in the other genome.
In fact, only a small proportion of the genome aligned to multiple
regions (about 3.3%) or to non-syntenic regions (about 3.2%); the
conclusions below are not signiﬁcantly altered if we restrict atten-
tion to sequences that match uniquely in syntenic regions. Within
the regions forming alignments, about 88.4% of individual human
bases were aligned to bases in mouse, with the remainder aligned to
indels (insertions or deletions). The alignments included approxi-
mately 98% of known coding regions, indicating that they correctly
captured known, well-conserved sequence.
Regions that could be aligned clearly at the nucleotide level
totalled about 1.1 Gb, corresponding to roughly 40% of the
human genome (Fig. 22). This proportion may seem high if one
imagines that all such sequence conservation reﬂects biological
function, but it does not. Simulation experiments show that DNA
sequences subjected to random mutation at the neutral rate that has
occurred between the human and mouse genomes (see below) can
still be readily aligned by computer. In other words, most of the
non-functional orthologous sequences should still be alignable.
Consistent with this analysis, the alignable portion of the genomes
contains a vast number of ancestral repeats, primarily relics of
transposons that were present in the genome of our common
ancestor with mouse and most of which are non-functional.
But if orthologous sequences should be readily alignable, the
question becomes: why isn’t the alignable portion much higher than
40%? In fact, the proportion is broadly consistent with what would
be expected given the probable rate of turnover of sequence in the
mouse and human genomes.
As a starting point, let us assume that the genome size of the last
common ancestor was about 2.9 Gb (similar to the modern gen-
omes of human and most other mammals) and let us focus only on
large-scale insertions and deletions, ignoring nucleotide-level indels
within aligned regions and lineage-speciﬁc duplications. These
assumptions will be relaxed below.
This would imply no net change in genome size in the human
lineage despite the accumulation of about 700 Mb of lineage-
speciﬁc repeat sequence since the common ancestor (see section
on repeats). This would require approximately 700 Mb of deletions,
implying that about 24% (700 out of 2,900) of the ancestral genome
was deleted and about 76% retained in the human lineage. It would
also imply a net loss of about 400 Mb in the mouse lineage, despite
the probable addition of about 900 Mb of lineage-speciﬁc repeat
sequences, an estimate about 10% higher than that given by the
Figure 21 Protein evolution. a, Cumulative histogram of K A/K S values for locally
duplicated, paralogous mouse-speciﬁc gene clusters (black boxes) in comparison with
mouse–human orthologues (red boxes). The mouse-speciﬁc paralogues are more likely to
be under positive diversifying selection. b, Box plot of K A/K S values for different locally
duplicated, paralogous mouse-speciﬁc gene clusters. Full descriptions are found in Table
15. The chromosome on which the clusters are found is indicated in brackets after the
abbreviated cluster name. The K A/K S values for each sequence pair in the cluster was
calculated from sequences aligned using ClustalW (see Supplementary Information). The
red horizontal line represents the median and the box indicates the middle 67% of the
data between the 16th and 83rd percentiles. All of the paralogous clusters have median
K A/K S values that are higher than the mouse–human orthologue median K A/K S (0.115),
and 22 out of 25 have values greater than the 83rd percentile orthologue K A/K S (0.275).
The Cyp2d category includes K A/K S values calculated separately over two sequence-
similar regions in the alignment.

orthologous region on mouse chromosome 1 (b). In both cases, the alignment skips over
young/lineage-speciﬁc repeats (red boxes), but aligns through most of the ancestral
repeats (blue boxes) and non-repetitive sequence (no colour). The ancestral repeats that
do align are, not unexpectedly, identiﬁed as the same repeat category. Mouse also has a
larger number of simple-sequence repeats (green boxes).

RepeatMasker program to allow for incomplete sensitivity in the
more rapidly changing mouse genome. This would imply roughly
1,300 Mb of deletions, corresponding to the deletion of about 45%
(1,330 out of 2,900) and retention of 55% of the ancestral genome.
If there was no correlation in the ﬁxation of deletions in the two
lineages, the expected proportion of the ancestral genome retained
in both lineages would be about 42% (76% £ 55%). Complete
independence is unlikely because deletions of functional sequences
would have been selectively disadvantageous. However, deletions of
modest size may largely be neutral given the relatively low pro-
portion of functional sequence in the genome.
The estimates can be adjusted (see Supplementary Information)
to account for nucleotide-level insertions and deletions and lineage-
speciﬁc duplications (the expectation remains roughly the same), or
to allow for different assumptions about ancestral genome size (the
expectation increases by 3–4% for an intermediate size of about
2.7 Gb). This simple analysis suggests that the observed proportion
of alignable genome (about 40%) is not surprising, but rather it
probably reﬂects the actual proportion of orthologous genome
remaining after the deletion in the two lineages.
In a preliminary test of this hypothesis, we identiﬁed ancestral
repeats in the mouse that lay in intervals deﬁned by orthologous
landmarks. Examination of the corresponding interval in the
human genome showed a rate of loss of these elements, broadly
consistent with the 24% deletion rate in the human lineage assumed
above (see Supplementary Information).
Such a deletion rate in the human lineage over about 75 million
years is also roughly compatible with the observation that roughly
6% has been deleted over about 22 million years since the divergence
from baboon, an estimate derived from the sequencing of speciﬁc
regions in human and baboon (E. Green, unpublished data).
Although we do not have a corresponding direct estimate of
large-scale deletions in the mouse lineage, the predicted rate of
about 45% is roughly twice as high as for the human lineage, which
is similar to the ratio seen for nucleotide substitutions.
Rate of neutral substitution
The genome-wide alignments can be used to measure divergence
rates for different types of sequence. The neutral substitution rate,
for example, can be estimated from the alignment of non-functional
DNA. We believe that the best representative of this class is ancestral
repeat sequence, representing transposable elements inserted and
ﬁxed before the mouse–human divergence. Such ancestral repeats
are more likely than any other sequence in the genome to have been
under no functional constraint.
The human–mouse alignment catalogue contains approximately
165 Mb of ancestral repeat sequences, with most being clearly
orthologous by alignment of adjacent non-repetitive DNA. These
alignments show 66.7% sequence identity. The observed base
changes can be used to infer the underlying substitution rate,
which includes back mutations, by using various continuous-time
Markov models230. Applying the REV model231 to the ancestral
repeat sites, we estimate that neutral divergence has led to between
0.46 and 0.47 substitutions per site (see Supplementary Infor-
mation). Similar results are obtained for any of the other published
continuous-time Markov models that distinguish between tran-
sitions and transversions (D. Haussler, unpublished data). Although
the model does not assign substitutions separately to the mouse and
human lineages, as discussed above in the repeat section, the
roughly twofold higher mutation rate in mouse (see above) implies
that the substitutions distribute as 0.31 per site (about 4 £ 1029
per year) in the mouse lineage and 0.16 (about 2 £ 1029 per year) in
the human lineage.
Having established the neutral substitution rate by examining
aligned ancestral repeats, we then investigated a second class of
potentially neutral sites: fourfold degenerate sites in codons of
genes. Fourfold degenerate sites are subject to selection in invert-
ebrates, such as Drosophila, but the situation is unclear for mam-
mals. We examined alignments between fourfold degenerate codons
in orthologous genes. The fourfold degenerate codons were deﬁned
as GCX (Ala), CCX (Pro), TCX (Ser), ACX (Thr), CGX (Arg), GGX
(Gly), CTX (Leu) and GTX (Val). Thus for Leu, Ser and Arg, we
used four of their six codons. Only fourfold degenerate codons in
which the ﬁrst two positions were identical in both species were
considered, so that the encoded amino acid was identical. Slightly
fewer than 2 million such sites were studied, deﬁned in the human
genome from about 9,600 human RefSeq cDNAs and aligned to
their mouse orthologues. The observed sequence identity in four-
fold degenerate sites was 67%, and the estimated number of
substitutions per site, between 0.46 and 0.47, was similar to that
in the ancestral repeat sites (see Supplementary Information).
Conservation in gene-related features
We used the genome-wide alignments to examine the extent of
conservation in gene-related features, including coding regions,
introns, untranslated regions, upstream regions and CpG islands.
For each type of feature, we characterized the nature of sequence
conservation (including typical percentage identity, inferred sub-
stitution rates and insertion/deletion rate). We also deﬁned a
conservation score S that measures the extent to which a given
window (typically 50 or 100 bp, in applications below) shows higher
conservation than expected by chance. The conservation score S for
an aligned region R is the normalized fraction of aligned bases that
are identical (obtained by subtracting the mean and dividing by the
standard deviation) and is given by:
S ¼ SðRÞ ¼
ðp 2 mÞ
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
mð1 2 mÞ=n
p
where n is the number of sites within the window that are aligned, p
is the fraction of aligned sites that are identical in the two genomes,
and m is the average fraction of sites that are identical in aligned
ancestral repeats in the surrounding region (m ¼ 0.667 as a genome-
wide average, but, as discussed below, ﬂuctuates locally). When the
conservation score S is calculated for the set of all ancestral repeats,
it has a mean of 0 (by deﬁnition) and a standard deviation of 1.19
and 1.23 for windows of 50 and 100 bp, respectively (Fig. 23). This
deﬁnes the typical ﬂuctuation in conservation score in neutral
sequences. The properties of the alignments are shown in Table 16
and the distribution of conservation scores relative to neutral
substitution is shown in Fig. 24.
Coding regions are distinctive in many ways. They show the
highest degree of conservation (85% sequence identity or 0.165
substitutions per nucleotide site). Alignment gaps are tenfold less
common than in non-coding regions. In addition, 52% of coding
regions have highly signiﬁcant alignments to more than one
genomic region (typically, paralogues and pseudogenes), whereas
only 3.3% of the genome shows such multiple alignments.
Introns are very similar, in most respects, to the genome as a
whole in terms of percentage identity, gaps and multiple alignment
statistics.
Conservation levels in 5
0 and 3
0 UTRs are similar to one another
and intermediate between levels in coding regions and introns. The
sequence identity of 75–76% is well above the intronic level of 69%.
Note that our estimate of sequence identity is higher than the 70–
71% reported previously181, in large part because that study used a
global rather than a local alignment programme. The insertion and
deletion characteristics of the UTRs are very similar to those of
introns. Overall, 5
0 UTRs are slightly better conserved than 3
0 UTRs;
however, signiﬁcantly more of 3
0-UTR sequence is covered by
multiple alignments than 5
0-UTR sequence (21% compared with
16%). This may reﬂect the fact that pseudogene insertion tends to
proceed from the 3
0 end and often terminates before completion.
Promoter regions are of considerable interest. We analysed the
regions located 200 bp upstream of transcription start because they

were likely to contain important promoter and regulatory signals.
However, such analysis is necessarily limited by the fact that
transcriptional start sites remain poorly deﬁned for many genes.
With this caveat, the upstream regions share many characteristics of
5
0 UTRs but have a lower percentage identity, a signiﬁcantly lower
proportion covered by multiple alignments, and a higher (GþC)
content.
CpG islands show a conservation level similar to those of
promoter and UTR regions (Fig. 24).
We also observed that levels of conservation were not uniform
across these features (coding regions, introns, UTRs, upstream
regions and CpG islands)232. Figure 25 shows how conservation
levels vary regionally within the features of a ‘typical’ gene. Sequence
identity rises gradually from a background level to 78% near
the approximate transcription start site, where the level reaches a
plateau. It is possible that sharper deﬁnitions of transcriptional start
sites would allow the footprint of the TATA box and other common
structures near the transcription start site to emerge. Conversely,
many human promoters lack a TATA box, and transcription start at
such promoters is not typically sharply deﬁned233. Sequence identity
falls slowly across the 5
0 UTR, and then starts to rise again near the
start codon. As expected, conservation levels rise sharply at the
translation start site234, remain high throughout the coding regions,
and have sharp peaks at splice sites. After the stop codon, the per
cent identity is relatively low for most of the 3
0 UTR, but then begins
to increase about 200 bases before the polyadenylation site. The
Figure 23 Distribution of the conservation score S(R). The empirical distribution of S(R)
for all 1.9 million non-overlapping 50-bp windows (blue) containing at least 45 aligned
ancestral repeat sites (standard deviation 1.19) and 1.7 million non-overlapping 100-bp
windows (green) containing at least 50 aligned ancestral repeat sites (standard deviation
1.23). Both curves are bell-shaped, with a mean of zero, but the standard deviations are
higher than would be expected if the sites in each window were independent and
conserved with (locally estimated) probability m. In that case the distribution of S would be
approximately normal with a standard deviation of 1. Thus, these data show that there is
some dependency between the substitutions within the window.

main polyadenylation signal is AATAAA or ATTAAA positioned 10–
30 bases upstream of polyadenylation235. The region of increased
conservation is considerably longer than can be explained by the
polyadenylation signal alone, suggesting that other 3
0-UTR regu-
latory signals, such as those that affect mRNA stability and local-
ization, may frequently occur near the end of the mRNA. After the
polyadenylation site, there is a 30-base plateau of moderate con-
servation, corresponding to the weaker (T)-rich or (GþT)-rich
downstream region following the polyadenylation signal.
Conservation of gene structure
We also examined the conservation of exon structure and splice
signals in more detail using 1,506 pairs of human–mouse RefSeq
genes
conﬁdently
assigned
to
be
orthologous
(http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/HomoloGene/). As previously reported
using smaller data sets236, overall gene structures are highly con-
served between orthologous pairs: 86% of the cases (1,289 out of
1,506) have the identical number of coding exons, and 46% (692 out
of 1,506) have the identical coding sequence length. When we
consider all exons rather than just coding exons, we ﬁnd that 941
pairs (62%) have the same number of exons. The true concordance
of gene structure between the two species is probably higher,
because differences will be exaggerated by differential represen-
tation of alternative splice forms between the two data sets,
difﬁculties in mapping the cDNA sequences back to the genome,
and the absence of true 5
0 and 3
0 ends.
The set of 1,289 genes with an identical number of coding exons
contains 10,061 pairs of orthologous exons (plus 124 intronless
genes). Exon length between orthologous exons is highly conserved:
9,131 (91%) of these human–mouse exon pairs have identical exon
length. When exon pairs do have different lengths, the differences
are predominantly multiples of three (858 out of the 930 with
different lengths), as expected from coding-frame constraints.
Nearly all orthologous exons conserve phase (10,015 or 99.5%).
In contrast, only 90 out of 8,896 orthologous introns (1%) have
identical length, although there is strong correlation between the
lengths of orthologous introns. Consistent with the smaller size of
the mouse genome overall, orthologous mouse introns tend to be
shorter. Excluding outliers, the average human intron in this data
set is 4,661 bp, whereas the average mouse intron is 3,888 bp.
Within the set of 1,506 orthologous human–mouse gene pairs,
there are 22 cases in which the overall coding length is identical
between the gene pairs, but they differ in the number of exons. Most
of these cases can be explained by a single intron insertion/deletion
(Fig. 26)237, demonstrating the dynamic (but slow) evolution of
gene structure.
We also found several non-canonical splice sites in the set of 8,896
orthologous introns, including RTATCCTY 5
0 splice signals charac-
teristic of U12 introns, which are singularly conserved (see ref. 238
for review). We found this 5
0 splice signal in 20 human and 22 mouse
introns from the set of 8,896, and 19 of these cases correspond to
orthologous introns, indicating high levels of conservation of this
distinct splicing mechanism. Also conserved are the non-canonical
GC-AG introns (mechanistically identical to the GT-AG canonical
introns): in the set there are 23 non-canonical GC-AG introns in
human and 23 in mouse, including 19 orthologous pairs.
Conservation in known regulatory regions
We similarly sought to study the extent of conservation in regulat-
ory control regions of genes232,239,240. So far, relatively few regulatory
elements have been studied extensively. We compiled a list of 95
well-characterized regulatory regions, including some liver-
speciﬁc241, muscle-speciﬁc242 and general regulatory regions243.
The sequences were carefully checked against the primary publi-
cations and trimmed to contain the smallest reported functional
unit. The distribution of the elements was: 10% in introns, 85% in
the immediate vicinity (,2 kb) of promoters, and 5% more distal
from promoters. About 19% overlapped a CpG island.
Figure 25 Variation in conservation across a gene. a, Conservation across a generic
gene, on the basis of 3,165 human RefSeq mRNAs with known position in the genome.
We sampled 200 evenly spaced bases across each of the variable-length regions labelled,
resampling completely from regions shorter than 200 bp. The graph shows the average
percentage of bases aligning and the average base identity when there is an alignment
over each sample. There are peaks of conservation at the transition from one region to
another. Here, in contrast to Table 16, only reviewed RefSeq mRNAs were used, and only
those having at least 40 bases of annotated 5
0 and 3
0 UTRs. The resulting picture,
however, is nearly indistinguishable from that obtained by using all RefSeq genes with at
least 40 base UTRs. b, Conservation near translation start site using the same data set as
in a. The bars show per cent identity of the 15 bases to either side of translation start. Note
the extreme conservation of the ﬁrst codon. After this, there is substantially less
conservation at the third codon position. The peak at position 23 corresponds to a purine
in the Kozak consensus sequence. c, Conservation near the 5
0 splice site. The peak of
conservation corresponds to the AG/GT consensus at this location, with the ﬁrst G in the
intron being nearly invariant. A G in the ﬁfth base of the intron is also found in a large
majority of 5
0 splice sites. An echo of the variation in the third codon position occurs here
because it is common for exons to begin and end at codon boundaries. d, Conservation
near the 3
0 splice site. Conservation in the last two bases of the intron—always AG for
introns processed by the major spliceosome—is very apparent. The polypyrimidine tract
beginning ﬁve bases into the intron is also visibly conserved. Once again, an echo of the
variation in the third codon position can be seen.

The extent of conservation (Fig. 24 and Table 16) was consider-
ably lower than in coding regions, but much higher than the neutral
rate in ancestral repeats or than the average rate across the genome.
Overall, the known regulatory regions showed a level of conserva-
tion similar to that of 5
0 UTRs. The (GþC) content is also
substantially higher for the regulatory elements than for the genome
as a whole, a property shared with exons and 5
0 UTRs.
Although the extent of conservation in regulatory regions—as
measured by the score S(R)—overlaps with that in neutral DNA
(Fig. 24), this does not preclude the use of this measure to identify
candidate regulatory elements. An example is given by the insulin-
like growth factor binding protein acid-labile subunit gene
(IGFALS), where the region surrounding a well-known transcrip-
tion factor binding site244–246 stands out as unusually conserved
using this measure (Fig. 27). More sophisticated models, such as
Markov models on the ﬁne texture of the alignments (matches,
transitions, transversions and gaps), may discriminate regulatory
regions under selection from neutrally evolving regions with better
efﬁciency329.
Proportion of genome under selection
We then set out to investigate the fraction of a mammalian genome
under evolutionary selection for biological function.
To do this, we estimated the proportion of the genome that is
better conserved than would be expected given the underlying
neutral rate of substitution. We compared the overall distribution
S genome of conservation scores for the genome to the neutral
distribution Sneutral of conservation scores for ancestral repeats
(Fig. 23, blue curve) using a genome-wide set of 14.3 million
non-overlapping 50-bp (human) windows, each containing at
least 45 bp (mean 48.67 bp) of aligned sequence. The genome-
wide score distribution for these windows has a prominent tail
extending to the right, reﬂecting a substantial excess of windows
with high conservation scores relative to the neutral rate (Fig. 28).
The excess can be estimated by decomposing the genome-wide
distribution Sgenome as a mixture of two components: Sneutral and
Sselected (reﬂecting windows under selection).
The mixture coefﬁcients indicate that at least 20.8% of the
windows are under selection, with the remainder consistent with
neutral substitution. Because about 25.2% of all human bases are
contained in the windows, this suggests that at least 5.25% (25.2%
of 20.8%) of the 50-base windows in the human genome is under
selection. Repeating the analysis on more stringently ﬁltered align-
ments (with non-syntenic and non-reciprocal best matches removed)
requiring different numbers of aligned bases per window and with
100-bp windows, yields similar estimates, ranging mostly from 4.8%
to about 6.1% of windows under selection (D. Haussler, unpublished
data), as does using an alternative score function that considers
ﬂanking base context effects and uses a gap penalty330. Signiﬁcantly
smaller window sizes, for example, 30 bp, do not provide sufﬁcient
statistical separation between the neutral and genome-wide score
distributions to provide useful estimates of the share under
selection.
The analysis thus suggests that about 5% of small segments
(50 bp) in the human genome are under evolutionary selection
for biological functions common to human and mouse. This
corresponds to regions totalling about 140 Mb of human genomic
DNA, although not all of the nucleotides in these windows are
under selection. In addition, some bases outside these windows are
likely to be under selection. In a loose sense, these regions might be
regarded as containing the ‘functional’ conserved subset of the
mammalian genome. Of course, it should be noted that non-
conserved sequence may have important roles, for example, as a
passive spacer or providing a function speciﬁc to one lineage.
Notably, protein-coding regions of genes can account for only a
fraction of the genome under selection. From our analysis of the
Figure 26 The human spermidine synthase gene (SRM ) on chromosome 1, involved in
the biosynthesis of polyamines, and its mouse orthologue (Srm) on chromosome 4. The

All other exons are purple.
Figure 27 Conservation scores for 50-bp windows in a 4.5-kb region containing the
human insulin-like growth factor binding protein acid labile subunit (IGFALS) gene. In the
track near the top of ﬁgure, the two coding exons of the gene are displayed as taller blue
rectangles, UTRs as shorter rectangles, and the intron, which separates the coding exons,
is shown as a barbed line indicating direction of transcription (the gene is on the reverse
strand). Log probability scores (L-scores) for all 50-bp windows are shown below the
gene. The L-score is 2log10(p), where p is the probability under the neutral density,
S neutral, of getting a conservation score as high as is observed in the window. Many
windows in the coding region get L-scores greater than 3, indicating less than a 1/1,000
chance of occurring under neutral evolution (P selected(S) . 0.94; see Fig. 28), and some
in a local peak in the upstream region of the gene on the right show L-scores greater than
2, indicating less than a 1/100 chance of occurring (P selected(S ) . 0.75). The red bar
shows the location of the interferon-g-activated sequence-like element (GLE), which is
bound by transcription factors from the STAT5a and STAT5b protein family to control
expression of this gene244,245. Additional regulatory elements may be located in the
other peaks of conservation. This ﬁgure is taken with permission from the UCSC browser

number and properties of genes, coding regions comprise only
about 1.5% of the human genome and account for less than half of
the segments under selection.
What accounts for the remainder of the genome under selection?
About 1% of the genome is contained in untranslated regions of
protein-coding genes, and some of this sequence is under some
functional constraint. Another main class of interest are those
sequences that control gene expression, such as the control element
for the IGFALS gene shown in Fig. 27; if a typical gene contains a few
such regulatory sequences, there may be tens to hundreds of
thousands of such elements. In addition, conserved sequences
probably encode non-protein-coding RNAs (which remain difﬁcult
to discern) and chromosomal structural elements. Furthermore,
some of the conserved fraction may correspond to sequences that
were under selection for some period of time but are no longer
functional; these could include recent pseudogenes. In an accom-
panying paper, Dermitzakis and colleagues show that a large
number of conserved sequences on human chromosome 21 are
actively conserved but are unlikely to be genes, suggesting that a
large number of non-coding sequence are under selection247.
Characterization of the conserved sequences should be a high
priority for genomics in the years ahead.
The analysis above allows us to infer the proportion of the
genome under selection by decomposing the curve Sgenome into
curves Sneutral and Sselected. Importantly, it does not deﬁnitively
assign an individual conserved sequence as being neutral or selected.
One can calculate, for a sequence with conservation score S, the
probability Pselected(S) that the window of sequence belongs to the
selected subset (Fig. 28). The probability exceeds 83% for sequences
with S . 3 and 93% for S . 4, but is only 52% for S ¼ 2. In other
words, some functionally important sequence cannot be separated
cleanly from the tail of the distribution of neutral conservation.
How can we cleanly separate neutral and selected sequences? One
solution is to extend the analysis from two species to multiple
species from different branches of the mammalian radiation.
Neutral sequences will tend to drift in different ways along
each lineage, whereas selected sequences will tend to preserve
speciﬁc sites. Multiple species comparisons should thus sharpen
and separate the distributions of conservation scores, Sneutral and
Sselected.
Genome evolution: mutation
Genome-wide alignments also allow us to investigate how the
patterns of neutral substitution, deletion and insertion vary across
the genome, providing an insight on the underlying mutational
processes.
Substitution rate varies across the genome
Signiﬁcant variation in the level of sequence conservation has been
reported in several small-scale studies of human and mouse
genomic regions10,248–254 and in several larger-scale studies of coding
sequences255–260. It has not been clear in all cases whether the
variation reﬂects differences in neutral substitution rates or in
selection. The human–mouse genome alignments allow us to
address the variation more comprehensively and to test for co-
variation with the rates of other processes, such as insertions of
transposable elements255 and meiotic recombination258.
We used the collection of aligned ancestral repeats and aligned
fourfold degenerate sites to calculate the apparent neutral substi-
tution rate for about 2,500 overlapping 5-Mb windows across the
human genome. To accurately follow ﬂuctuations while accounting
for regional changes in base composition, the regional nucleotide
substitution rate in ancestral repeat sites, t AR, was calculated
separately for each 5-Mb window by maximum likelihood esti-
mation of the parameters of the REV model using only the ancestral
repeat sites in the window (average of about 280,000 sites per
window). The regional nucleotide substitution rate in fourfold
degenerate sites, t4D, was calculated similarly from an average of
about 3,700 fourfold degenerate sites per window. Windows with
fewer than 800 ancestral repeats or fourfold degenerate sites were
discarded.
The mean and standard deviations across the windows were
tAR ¼ 0.467 ^ 0.022 and t 4D ¼ 0.447 ^ 0.067 substitutions per
site. The standard deviation is much larger (over tenfold and
threefold, respectively) than would be expected from sampling
variance. These data clearly indicate substantial regional ﬂuctu-
ation. Regional variation is also evident in comparing the average
rates on different chromosomes (Fig. 29). Notably, the neutral
substitution rate is lowest for chromosome X. This observation is
consistent with recent reports, including our initial analysis of the
human genome1, that the mutation rate is about twofold lower in
female meiosis than male meiosis. Because the proportion of time
spent in the female germ line for chromosome X is 2/3 and for
autosomes is 1/2, the predicted substitution rate for chromosome X
should be about 8/9 or 89% of the genome-wide average. In fact, the
observed ratio is 87% for fourfold degenerate sites and 92% for
ancestral repeat sites. This would be consistent with (but does not
prove) a roughly twofold lower mutation rate in the female germ
line during the history of both the human and mouse lineages, and it
explains a small amount of the variation in the genome-wide
substitution rate. Nonetheless, the variability among autosomes is
still much greater than could occur under a uniform substitution
process, suggesting the existence of long-range factors that affect the
mutation rate.
Looking at a ﬁner scale, the two measures tAR and t4D are strongly
Figure 28 Proportion of the human genome under selection and the probability of a
genomic window to be under selection on the basis of conservation score. a, The
genome-wide density of conservation scores, S genome (dark blue), was decomposed into a
mixture of two component densities: S neutral (red) and S selected (light blue and grey).
S genome is derived from the conservation scores S(R) for all windows of 50 bp in the
human genome with at least 45 bases aligning to mouse. S neutral is a scaled version of the
S neutral density from the blue curve in Fig. 23 for the 50-bp windows in ancestral repeats,
representing neutrally evolving DNA. S selected is the difference between the blue density
and the red component, and thus represents a scaled version of S selected, the predicted
density for conservation scores of 50-bp windows in the human genome that are evolving
under selection. The scaling factors are the estimated mixture coefﬁcients, which are
p 0 ¼ 0.792 for S neutral, and 1 2 p 0 ¼ 0.208 for S selected. The coefﬁcient p 0 is
calculated as the minimum of the ratio between S genome(S) and S neutral(S) for all values of
S, giving a conservative estimate that maximizes the share of the mixture attributed to
S neutral. b, The probability, P selected(S), that a 50-bp window is under selection as a

correlated across the genome (Fig. 29). They often exhibit similar
behaviour across a human chromosome, as seen for human
chromosome 22 (Fig. 30).
What properties of chromosomal DNA could account for the
variation in substitution rate? One possible explanation is local
(GþC) content, but previous studies disagree on whether it corre-
lates strongly with divergence92,255,262,263. We ﬁnd that tAR and t4D
vary with local (GþC) content, although the dependence is non-
linear262,264 and is better ﬁtted by regression with a quadratic curve263
(Fig. 31). In other words, the substitution rate seems to be higher in
regions of extremely high or low (GþC) content, with the sign of the
correlation differing in regions with high versus low (GþC) con-
tent. This pattern persists if CpG substitutions are removed from the
analysis (data not shown).
Notably, tAR and t4D show different dependence on local (GþC)
content. In particular, t4D increases more sharply with high (GþC)
content, whereas tAR does not show as much divergence. In this and
some other properties, tAR and t4D show differing patterns; hence
they are not equivalent neutral sites. Differences in the nature of the
dependence on local (GþC) content imply that the (GþC) content
is a confounding variable in comparing tAR and t4D. Accordingly, we
normalized the rates for local (GþC) content by calculating the
residuals, t*AR and t*4D, with respect to the quadratic regressions
above. The correspondence along chromosome 22 (a particularly
(GþC)-rich chromosome) is markedly enhanced (r2 increases from
0.55 to 0.75) by this correction (Fig. 30), as is the overall genome-
wide correlation (r2 increases from 0.22 to 0.33).
Substitution rate co-varies with other evolutionary rates
In addition to nucleotide substitutions, genomes evolve by insertion
(primarily of transposable elements) and deletion. We examined the
rate of deletion in the mouse genome, as measured by the fraction of
non-aligning ancestral human DNA (NAanc). Although some of the
non-alignable sequence may represent lineage-speciﬁc insertions
not detected by RepeatMasker (http://ftp.genome.washington.edu/
cgi-bin/RepeatMasker)177 or failure to align some orthologous
sequences, the great bulk probably represents deletions in the
mouse genome. The fraction NAanc varies markedly across over-
lapping windows of 5 Mb, with a range from 0.295 to 0.985 and
mean and standard deviation 0.521 ^ 0.095.
We also examined the rate of insertion (and retention) in the
human genome since its divergence from mouse, as measured by the
proportion of lineage-speciﬁc repeats in overlapping 5-Mb win-
dows across the human genome. The overall level of insertion and
retention showed substantial variation across the genome, ranging
from 0.159 to 0.805 with a mean of 0.290 ^ 0.063. To avoid
complications from the tendency of some repeats, such as Alus, to
be selectively removed from some regions of the genome1, we used
one family of repeats, the LTRs, to monitor the relative frequency of
insertion and retention. Similar to repeats as a whole, the fraction of

a, Estimates are made from the REV model using all aligned sites of the given type in the
chromosome. Dashed lines show the genome-wide averages. Human chromosome 19 is
a conspicuous outlier for its very large number of substitutions in fourfold degenerate sites
(also noted in ref. 259); notably, its substitution rate in ancestral repeat sites is normal.
Chromosome X shows lower rates of substitution in both types of sites, consistent with the
observation that the male mutation rate is approximately twice the female rate1 (see text).
Variability in neutral rates among autosomes is signiﬁcant, as noted in ref. 13. b, Scatter

each window occupied by lineage-speciﬁc LTRs varies substantially
across the human genome, ranging from 0 to 0.378, with a mean of
0.0598 ^ 0.0197.
All three forces that alter the genome (nucleotide substitution,
deletion and insertion) thus vary substantially across the genome.
Moreover, they are signiﬁcantly correlated and tend to co-vary
along chromosomes (Fig. 30 and Table 17). Notably, these three
measures of interspecies divergence are also correlated with recent
substitutions in the human genome, as measured by the density of
SNPs identiﬁed by the SNP Consortium265 (Fig. 30).
Furthermore, recent studies report that divergence at fourfold
degenerate sites and SNP frequency are both correlated with the
local rate of meiotic recombination258,266–268. We examined the
relationship between our measures of genome-wide divergence
and recombination rate using recently reported high-resolution
measurements of recombination rates in the human genome269.
Both measures of neutral substitution rate and SNP rate showed a
signiﬁcant correlation with recombination rate (Fig. 30 and Table
17).
The correlations above are not explained by co-variation with
local (GþC) content. All except the correlation between SNP
frequency and LTR insertion rate remain signiﬁcant when depen-
dence on underlying human (GþC) content is factored out by
taking the residuals of a quadratic regression on regional human
(GþC) content; indeed, the correlations are for the most part
enhanced (Table 17). Similarly, correlations remain signiﬁcant
when the difference between the (GþC) content of orthologous
mouse and human regions is also factored out261. Thus, (GþC)
content changes between mouse and human, as explored pre-
viously259, do not adequately explain the correlations. Finally, to
obtain more rigorous estimates of signiﬁcance, the correlations were
re-evaluated on non-overlapping sets of 5-Mb windows, and on
non-overlapping 1-Mb windows as well, with similar results261.
Possible explanations for variation
What explains the correlation among these many measures of
genome divergence? It seems unlikely that direct selection would
account for variation and co-variation at such large scales (about
5 Mb) and involving abundant neutral sites taken from ancestral
transposon relics. Selection against deleterious mutations can
remove linked polymorphisms270,271, but it is not clear that such
effects or related effects272 could extend to such large scales or to
interspecies divergence over such large time periods273.
It seems more probable that these features reﬂect local variation
in underlying mutation rate, caused by differences in DNA metabo-
lism or chromosome physiology. The causative factors may include
recombination-associated mutagenesis258,266, transcription-associ-
ated mutagenesis274, transposon-associated deletion and genomic
rearrangement275–278, and replication timing279,280. Nuclear location
may also be involved, including proximity to matrix attachment
sites, heterochromatin, nuclear membrane, and origins of
replication.
It is clear that the mammalian genome is evolving under the
inﬂuence of non-uniform local forces. It remains an important
challenge to unravel the mechanistic basis and evolutionary con-
sequences of such variation.
Genetic variation among strains
To facilitate genetic mapping studies, it would be valuable to create a
mouse genetic map based on SNPs. The use of SNPs would allow the
generation of an even denser map, which would allow mouse
geneticists to fully exploit the recombinational resolution that can
be achieved in large crosses. A cross with 2,000 meioses divides the
genome (with a genetic length of about 16 morgans) into approxi-
mately 32,000 distinct recombinational ‘bins’ and it would be
convenient to have an even higher density of genetic markers
available for ﬁne-scale mapping. In addition, SNPs offer potential
advantages in terms of automation and parallelism265,281,282.
Given a reference sequence of the B6 strain, it is straightforward
to ﬁnd SNPs relative to any other strain. One simply needs to
generate random shotgun reads from the strain, align them to the
reference sequence and search for high-quality sequence differences.
As a pilot project, we created initial SNP collections from three
strains: 129S1/SvImJ (129), C3H/HeJ (C3H) and BALB/cByJ
(BALB) (Table 18). So far we have identiﬁed 47,279 high-quality
candidate SNPs between the 129 and B6 strains, 20,294 SNPs
between C3H and B6 and 11,696 between BALB and B6. The initial
SNP collection thus contains more than 79,000 SNPs. This total is
expected to grow with deeper coverage and the inclusion of

additional strains. We tested a random sample of 83 candidate SNPs
by resequencing and found that all 83 were authentic, indicating
that most of the candidate SNPs are true variants.
The average density of SNPs between B6 and each of the three
strains was in the range 1 per 500–700 bp. The distribution of SNPs
is highly non-uniform (consistent with earlier observations282).
Some regions of the genome appear to be unusually rich in SNPs,
whereas others are devoid of SNPs.
In an accompanying paper, Wade and colleagues283 analyse this
non-uniform distribution of SNPs and demonstrate that genetic
variation between strains occurs in a harlequin pattern of alternat-
ing blocks of either high or low SNP rate, typically extending more
than 1 Mb. Genotyping of additional strains reveals that the
SNPs largely represent alternative alleles from M. m. domesticus
and M. m. musculus, and that the blocks probably represent the
distinct segmental contributions of the two subspecies to existing
laboratory mouse strains. Detailed knowledge of these blocks can
thus allow reconstruction of the history and relationship among
mouse strains. Furthermore, it can be used to perform association
studies on mouse strains, by correlating differences in phenotype
across multiple strains with the underlying block structure of
genetic variation.
Implications for the laboratory mouse
The promise of genomics is the ability to connect phenotypes with
genotypes for a wide variety of traits and to use the resulting
molecular insights to develop new approaches for the cure and
prevention of disease. The laboratory mouse occupies a central
place in this vision, both as a prototype for all mammalian biology
and as a well-characterized organism for modelling human disease
states15,16,123. In this section, we brieﬂy discuss ways in which the
mouse genome sequence will accelerate biomedical progress in the
future. Because the sequence has been made available in public
databases in advance of publication, examples for many of the
predictions can already be cited.
Positional cloning of genes for mendelian phenotypes
More than 1,000 spontaneously arising and radiation-induced
mouse mutants causing heritable mendelian phenotypes are cata-
logued in the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) database (http://
www.informatics.jax.org). Largely through positional cloning, the
molecular defect is now known for about 200 of these mutants. The
availability of an annotated mouse genome sequence now provides
the most efﬁcient tool yet in the gene hunter’s toolkit. One can move
directly from genetic mapping to identiﬁcation of candidate genes,
and the experimental process is reduced to PCR ampliﬁcation and
sequencing of exons and other conserved elements in the candidate
interval. With this streamlined protocol, it is anticipated that many
decades-old mouse mutants will be understood precisely at the
DNA level in the near future. An example of how the draft genome
sequence has already been successfully used is the recent identiﬁ-
cation of the mouse mutation ‘chocolate’ in the melanosome
protein Rab38 (ref. 284).
The mouse genome sequence will be even more crucial in efforts
to exploit the growing repertoire of mutant mice being generated by
chemical mutagenesis with N-ethyl-N-nitrosurea (ENU) and other
agents. At least ten large-scale ENU mutagenesis centres have
recently been established worldwide, focusing on dominant or
recessive screens for a wide variety of viable, clinically relevant
phenotypes15. Hundreds of new mutants with biochemical,
development and behavioural phenotypes are being generated
each year. For each mutant, identiﬁcation of the molecular cause
will require positional cloning.
Another means of generating mutants, the so-called ‘gene trap’
approach, uses a promoterless reporter construct for random
insertion into the genome of embryonic stem cells. Expression of
the reporter correlates with integration into a transcriptional unit,
which is disrupted by the event and confers its tissue and develop-
mental speciﬁcity to the reporter. Several large-scale gene-trap
programmes are underway worldwide15. Availability of the genome
sequence now makes the determination of the precise integration
site in an interesting mutant an almost trivial exercise.
Identiﬁcation of quantitative trait loci
The availability of more than 50 commonly used laboratory inbred
strains of mice, each with its own phenotype for multiple continu-
ously variable traits, has provided an important opportunity to map
QTLs that underlie heritable phenotypic variation. A systematic
initiative is currently underway285 to deﬁne parameters such as body
weight, behavioural patterns, and disease susceptibility among a
standard set of inbred lines, and to make these data freely available
to the scientiﬁc community in the Mouse Phenome Database
(www.jax.org/phenome). Appropriate crosses between such lines,
followed by genotyping, will enable the mapping of QTLs, which
can then be subjected to positional cloning. The degree of difﬁculty
is substantially greater for a QTL cloning project than for a
mendelian disorder, however, as the responsible intervals are usually
much larger, the boundaries more difﬁcult to delineate precisely,
and the causative variant often much more subtle286. For these
reasons, only a handful of the approximately 1,000 mapped QTLs
have been identiﬁed at the molecular level. The availability of the
mouse sequence should greatly improve the chances for future
success.
Success in QTL identiﬁcation will be enhanced if genetic mapping
can be combined with genomic sequence, expression array data and
proteomic data. Furthermore, the use of high-density SNP maps to
identify blocks of ancestral identity among mouse strains and to
correlate them with phenotypes may assist in the design of QTL
experiments. The availability of BAC libraries from several strains
will facilitate testing candidate genes for QTLs through the con-
struction of transgenic mice287. The combination of multiple
perspectives on genome sequence, variation and function should
thus provide a powerful platform for revealing molecular mecha-
nisms of phenotypic variation.
Creation of knockout and knockin mice
The wide application of homologous recombination in embryonic
stem cells has provided a remarkable abundance of ‘custom’ mice
with speciﬁcally engineered loss- or gain-of-function mutations in
speciﬁc genes of biological or medical interest. Yet this remains a
time-consuming process. The design of recombinant DNA con-
structs for injection has often been delayed by incomplete knowl-
edge of gene structure, requiring tedious restriction mapping or
sequencing, and occasionally giving rise to unsatisfying outcomes
due to incorrect information. The availability of the mouse genome
sequence will both speed the design of such constructs and reduce
the likelihood of unfortunate choices. Furthermore, the long-range
continuity of the sequence should facilitate the generation of
models of contiguous gene-deletion syndromes.
Creation of transgenic animals
For many transgenic experiments, it is important to maintain copy-
dependent, tissue-speciﬁc expression of the transgene. This is most
readily accomplished through BAC transgenesis. The availability of
a deep, end-sequenced BAC library from the B6 strain mapped to

the genome sequence now makes it straightforward to obtain a
desired gene in a BAC for such experiments; end-sequenced BAC
libraries from other strains should be available in the future. BACs
also provide the ability to make mutant alleles with relative ease, by
taking advantage of powerful genetic engineering techniques for
custom mutagenesis in the Escherichia coli host.
Applications to cancer
The mouse genome sequence also has powerful applications to the
molecular characterization of the somatic mutations that result in
neoplasia. High-density SNP mapping to identify loss of hetero-
zygosity288,289, combined with comparative genomic hybridization
using cDNA or BAC arrays290,291, can be used to identify chromo-
somal segments showing loss or gain of copy number in particular
tumour types. The combination of such approaches with expression
arrays that include all mouse genes should further enhance the
ability to pinpoint the molecular lesions that result in carcinogen-
esis. Full sequencing of all the exons and regulatory regions of
known tumour suppressors, oncogenes, and other candidate genes
can now be contemplated, as has been initiated in a few centres for
human tumours292.
As a speciﬁc example of the use of the draft sequence for oncogene
discovery, several groups recently used retroviral infection in mice
to recover new cancer susceptibility loci. The ability to compare
rapidly retrieved sequence tags to the draft genome sequence greatly
accelerated the process of cancer gene discovery293–295.
Making better mouse models
Not all mouse models replicate the human phenotype in the
expected way. The availability of the full human and mouse
sequences provides an opportunity to anticipate these differences,
and perhaps to compensate for them. In some instances, it may turn
out that the murine mutation did not reside in the true orthologue
of the human disease gene. Alternatively, in a circumstance where
the human genome contains only a single gene family member, but
the mouse genome contains a paralogue as well as the orthologue,
one can anticipate that knockout of the orthologue alone may give a
much milder phenotype (or none at all). Such was the case, for
instance, with the occulocerebrorenal syndrome described by Lowe
and colleagues296. Creating double knockout mice may then provide
a closer match to the human disease phenotype.
Understanding gene regulation
Of the approximately 5% of windows of the mammalian genome
that are under selection, most do not appear to code for protein.
Much of this sequence is probably involved in the regulation of gene
expression. It should be possible to pinpoint these regulatory
elements more precisely with the availability of additional related
genomes. However, mouse is likely to provide the most powerful
experimental platform for generating and testing hypotheses about
their function. An example is the recent demonstration, based on
mouse–human sequence alignment followed by knockout manipu-
lation, of several long-range locus control regions that affect
expression of the Il4/Il13/Il5 cluster4.
Conclusion
The mouse provides a unique lens through which we can view
ourselves. As the leading mammalian system for genetic research
over the past century, it has provided a model for human physiology
and disease, leading to major discoveries in such ﬁelds as immu-
nology and metabolism. With the availability of the mouse genome
sequence, it now provides a model and informs the study of our
genome as well.
Comparative genome analysis is perhaps the most powerful tool
for understanding biological function. Its power lies in the fact that
evolution’s crucible is a far more sensitive instrument than any other
available to modern experimental science: a functional alteration
that diminishes a mammal’s ﬁtness by one part in 104 is undetect-
able at the laboratory bench, but is lethal from the standpoint of
evolution.
Comparative analysis of genomes should thus make it possible to
discern, by virtue of evolutionary conservation, biological features
that would otherwise escape our notice. In this way, it will play a
crucial role in our understanding of the human genome and thereby
help lay the foundation for biomedicine in the twenty-ﬁrst century.
The initial sequence of the mouse genome reported here is merely
a ﬁrst step in this intellectual programme. The sequencing of many
additional mammalian and other vertebrate genomes will be needed
to extract the full information hidden within our chromosomes.
Moreover, as we begin to understand the common elements shared
among species, it may also become possible to approach the even
harder challenge of identifying and understanding the functional
differences that make each species unique.
