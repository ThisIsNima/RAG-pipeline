Abstract
Research on fluorescent semiconductor nanocrystals (also known as quantum dots or qdots) has
evolved over the past two decades from electronic materials science to biological applications. We
review current approaches to the synthesis, solubilization, and functionalization of qdots and their
applications to cell and animal biology. Recent examples of their experimental use include the
observation of diffusion of individual glycine receptors in living neurons and the identification of
lymph nodes in live animals by near-infrared emission during surgery. The new generations of qdots
have far-reaching potential for the study of intracellular processes at the single-molecule level, high-
resolution cellular imaging, long-term in vivo observation of cell trafficking, tumor targeting, and
diagnostics.
The improved resolution, sensitivity, and versatility of fluorescence microscopy (1) and the
development of fluorescent sensors and labeling of proteins in live cells have yielded a clearer
understanding of the dynamics of intracellular networks, signal transduction, and cell-cell
interaction (2). However, the monumental task of elucidating the role of all proteins and their
mutual interactions in a given organism—that is, completing its proteome and its interactome
—will require new approaches and tools. Single-molecule methods (3) will play a major role
in this endeavor, but the complex milieu encountered inside live cells requires substantial
adaptations of current in vitro techniques. Two problems associated with fluorescence
microscopy—cell autofluorescence in the visible spectrum (which can mask signals from
labeled molecules) and the requirement of long observation times—have created a need for
new probes that emit in the near-infrared (NIR) region (wavelength >700 nm) and are more
photo-stable than current organic fluorophores.
Properties of Qdots
Several characteristics distinguish qdots from the commonly used fluorophores. [A more
detailed description of qdot properties can be found in (4) and references listed in the online

diameter whose size and shape can be precisely controlled by the duration, temperature, and
ligand molecules used in the synthesis (4). This process yields qdots that have composition-
and size-dependent absorption and emission (Fig. 1A). Absorption of a photon with energy
above the semiconductor band gap energy results in the creation of an electron-hole pair (or
exciton). The absorption has an increased probability at higher energies (i.e., shorter
wavelengths) and results in a broadband absorption spectrum, in marked contrast to standard
fluorophores (Fig. 1B). For nanocrystals smaller than the so-called Bohr exciton radius (a few
nanometers), energy levels are quantized, with values directly related to the qdot size (an effect
called quantum confinement, hence the name ‘‘quantum dots’’) (4). The radiative
recombination of an exciton [characterized by a long lifetime, >10 ns (5)] leads to the emission
of a photon in a narrow, symmetric energy band (Fig. 1), another difference from the red-tailed
emission spectra and short lifetimes of most fluorophores. The long fluorescence lifetime of
qdots enables the use of time-gated detection (6) to separate their signal from that of shorter
lived species (such as background autofluorescence encountered in cells).
Surface defects in the crystal structure act as temporary ‘‘traps’’ for the electron or hole,
preventing their radiative recombination. The alternation of trapping and untrapping events
results in intermittent fluorescence (blinking) visible at the single-molecule level (7) and
reduces the overall quantum yield, which is the ratio of emitted to absorbed photons. One way
to overcome these problems, and to protect surface atoms from oxidation and other chemical
reactions, is to grow a shell of a few atomic layers of a material with a larger band gap on top
of the nanocrystal core. This shell can be designed carefully to obtain quantum yields close to
90% (8); this step also enhances qdots’ photostability by several orders of magnitude relative
to conventional dyes (9).
Single qdots can be observed and tracked over an extended period of time (up to a few hours)
with confocal microscopy (10), total internal reflection microscopy (11,12), or basic wide-field
epifluorescence microscopy (12–14). Single-molecule studies of qdots have revealed
phenomena hidden in ensemble measurements, such as blinking (7), spectral jumps (15), or
the existence of multiple long fluorescence lifetimes (16). Single-molecule microscopy is
possibly one of the most exciting new capabilities offered to the biologist, as discussed below.
A related technique, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, has allowed determination of the
brightness per particle and also provides a measurement of the average qdot size (17,18) (see
Fig. 1C for a comparison scale).
Qdots are also excellent probes for two-photon confocal microscopy because they are
characterized by a very large absorption cross section (17). Naturally, they can be used
simultaneously with standard dyes. In particular, qdots have a largely untapped potential as
customizable donors of a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair (19).
Qdot Solubilization and Functionalization
Qdots are mostly synthesized in nonpolar organic solvents. If they are to be solubilized in
aqueous buffers, their hydrophobic surface ligands must be replaced by amphiphilic ones.
Different qdot solubilization strategies have been devised over the past few years (Fig. 2),
including (i) ligand exchange with simple thiol-containing molecules (20,21) or more
sophisticated ones such as oligomeric phosphines (22), dendrons (23), and peptides (24); (ii)
encapsulation by a layer of amphiphilic diblock (25) or triblock copolymers (26) or in silica
shells (27,28), phospholipid micelles (29), polymer beads (30), polymer shells (31), or
amphiphilic polysaccharides (32); and (iii) combinations of layers of different molecules
conferring the required colloidal stability to qdots (9,33). Recent developments include a
promising water-based synthesis method (34,35) that yields particles that emit from the visible

to the NIR spectrum and are intrinsically water-soluble, but the particles have yet to be tested
in biological environments.
Unless used as a nonspecific fluorescent stain, qdots require some sort of biological
‘‘interfacing.’’ For simple applications such as qdot tagging of a target molecule, a single
recognition moiety can be grafted to the qdot (e.g., DNA oligonucleotide or aptamer, antibody,
etc.) or, simpler yet, used as the qdot solubilization ligand (36). Qdot ligands containing either
an amine or a carboxyl group, for instance, offer the possibility of cross-linking molecules
containing a thiol group (29,37,38) or an N-hydroxysuccinimyl ester moiety (24,27) by means
of standard bioconjugation reactions. Another approach uses electrostatic interactions between
qdots and charged adapter molecules, or between qdots and proteins modified to incorporate
charged domains (39). These functionalization steps can be repeated to add or change
functionality. For instance, streptavidin-coated qdots can be used in combination with
biotinylated proteins or antibodies (13,24,25,40,41). By extension, a generic three-layer
approach [using (i) an antibody against a specific target, (ii) a biotinylated secondary antibody
against the first, and (iii) a streptavidin-coated qdot] allows qdot labeling of most types of target
(13,25).
The large number (10 to 100) of potential surface attachment groups can be used to ‘‘graft’’
different functionalities to individual qdots, resulting in multipotent probes. For instance, in
addition to a recognition moiety, qdots can be equipped with a membrane-crossing or cell-
internalization capability, and/or an enzymatic function. The production of biologically
synthesized qdots consisting of CdS cores coated by natural peptides (42) led us to investigate
the peptide-coating approach for the surface modification of qdots (Fig. 2B). Peptides have the
advantage of being easily customized, and with the correct choice of sequence, a single-step
surfactant exchange can yield all necessary functions: (i) Protect the core/shell structure and
maintain the original qdot photophysics, (ii) solubilize qdots, (iii) provide a biological
interface, and (iv) allow the incorporation of multiple functions. The resulting particles have
excellent colloidal properties, photophysics, and biocompatibility, and this ‘‘peptide toolkit’’
can easily be tailored to provide additional functionalities. Such functionalities can be
improved by molecular evolution, a strategy that has proven extremely powerful for the
recognition, synthesis, and self-assembly of nanocrystals (43).
Qdots in Cell Biology
Over the past few years, qdots have been tested in most biotechnological applications that use
fluorescence, including DNA array technology, immunofluorescence assays [reviewed in
(44)], and cell and animal biology. Some of the early and most successful uses of qdots have
been in immunofluorescence labeling of fixed cells and tissues; immuno-staining of membrane
proteins (9,25,37,45,46), microtubules (25), actin (25,27), and nuclear antigens (25); and
fluorescence in situ hybridization on chromosomes (21,47,48) or combed DNA (11). Qdots
tend to be brighter than dyes because of the compounded effects of extinction coefficients that
are an order of magnitude larger than those of most dyes (29,49), comparable quantum yield,
and similar emission saturation levels (18). But their main advantage resides in their resistance
to bleaching over long periods of time (minutes to hours), allowing the acquisition of images
that are crisp and well contrasted. This increased photostability is especially useful for three-
dimensional (3D) optical sectioning, where a major issue is bleaching of fluorophores during
acquisition of successive z-sections, which compromises the correct reconstruction of 3D
structures. The gain obtained with qdots was illustrated by the high-resolution 3D confocal
imaging of an unforeseen domain distribution of band3, a membrane protein involved in anion
transport in erythrocytes (45) and that of clusters of overexpressed multidrug P-glycoproteins
(Pgp’s) in breast adenocarcinoma cell membranes (9).

The most interesting property of qdots for immunofluorescence is the very small number of
qdots necessary to produce a signal. Indeed, several studies have reported flickering of some
specimens, a phenomenon due to the blinking of a small number of qdots (20,47). This
demonstrates that single qdots can still be observed in immunocytological conditions, with an
ultimate sensitivity limit of one qdot per target molecule. Additionally, qdots are available in
a virtually unlimited number of well-separated colors, all excitable by a single wavelength
(Fig. 1). Aside from simplifying image acquisition, this property could be used in confocal
microscopy to perform nanometer-resolution colocalization of multiple-color individual qdots
(10).
Live-cell experiments introduce a few extra levels of complexity, depending on the application:
whole-cell labeling, labeling of membrane-bound proteins, and cytoplasmic or nuclear target
labeling. Whole-cell labeling is of particular interest for cell or pathogen detection, cell
tracking, and cell lineage studies. This can be achieved without any functionalization through
microinjection (29), electroporation, or even phagocytosis of qdots (40,50). Such
internalization was observed in phagokinetic human cancer cells (51) plated on a qdot-coated
coverslip. Peptide translocation domains or cationic lipids have also been shown to be efficient
facilitators of endocytosis, allowing rapid labeling of whole cell populations with specific
colors (50). A better specificity and efficiency can be obtained with functionalized qdots.
Transferrin was used to facilitate endocytosis by mammalian cells (20), a strategy also used
successfully to label pathogenic bacteria and yeast cells (52), whereas Gram-positive bacteria
were specifically detected by lectin-coated qdots (52). These and other studies have shown that
qdots have a considerable advantage over standard dyes: the possibility of long-term
observation with negligible photo-bleaching. In the experiment of Jaiswal et al. (40),
Dictyostelium discoideum cells colored according to their starvation time could be tracked
individually over several hours, allowing the determination that only starved cells contribute
to the formation of aggregation centers characteristic of this species. Dubertret et al. (29)
showed that in the Xenopus embryo, cells of the progeny of an injected cell still contain
fluorescent qdots after several days of development. In all eukaryotic cell studies, however,
qdots were observed to eventually end up in intracellular vesicles that could be identified in
some cases as endosomes (40,53,54) or lysosomes (55) by organelle-specific labeling, or in a
perinuclear region compatible with endosomal/lysosomal localization (29). Real-time and
long-term observation of translocation of these vesicles was possible in some cases (40,53).
Different types of functionalization have also been explored as a way to target qdots to cell
surface proteins. Some examples include streptavidin (13,25), secondary (56) or primary
antibodies (40), receptor ligands such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) (46,57) or serotonin
(58), recognition peptides (56), and affinity pairs such as biotin-avidin after engineering of the
target protein (24). Streptavidin-qdots were used to detect Her2 cancer markers on the surface
of SK-BR-3 human breast cancer cells via a biotinylated secondary antibody to human and a
humanized antibody to Her2. A similar strategy was also used in cultured spinal neurons to
detect single glycine receptors, which could be successfully tracked with high resolution as
they diffused in synaptic and extra-synaptic domains (13). The versatility of streptavidin-qdots
makes them attractive, but the cumulative volume of qdot, streptavidin, and the two layers of
antibodies may hinder their usefulness in studying the multimerization of receptors. Direct
qdot functionalization with a secondary antibody reduces the number of detection layers to
two; this method was used to detect the integrin αv subunit in SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma
cells (56). Partial clustering of qdots was reported when compared to a direct integrin-
recognition peptide qdot functionalization.
Another strategy consists of cross-linking primary antibodies to qdots. This was performed in
two different ways in a study targeting Pgp in HeLa cells transiently transfected with a Pgp-
encoding plasmid (40). The first approach involved the biotinylation of the Pgp primary

antibody, which was subsequently attached to avidin-coated qdots. The second approach
involved engineering an adaptor protein with both binding affinity to the Fc region of antibodies
and electrostatic interactions with charged qdots (39,40). Both experiments demonstrated
specific surface labeling of the transfected cells and colocalization of the signal with that of an
enhanced green fluorescent protein–fused Pgp.
In a further step to reduce the size of qdot probes, researchers have used ligands of surface
receptors bound to qdots via a biotin-streptavidin link (46) or by direct cross-linking (57,58).
For instance, EGF-labeled qdots were used to study receptor-mediated signal transduction in
different cancer cell lines (46). EGF-qdots bound to cell filopodia erbB1 receptors were
observed to undergo a previously undetected retrograde transport (presumably along actin
filaments) toward the cell body. Endocytosis of EGF-qdot–targeted erbB1 receptors in vesicles
was also observed, followed by a rich dynamic pattern of diffusion, directed linear motion, and
vesicular fusion.
Some proteins can be recognized by peptides, so it is attractive to use peptides for qdot
functionalization. This strategy has been shown to work in human neuroblastoma with a short
engineered peptide directed against integrin (56). This phenomenon was also proven to be
relatively common by Akerman et al., who used three different peptides to target qdots to lung
endothelial cells, brain endothelial cells, and human breast carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo
(37). In the absence of such peptide sequences or of an identified ligand, the target molecule
can be engineered to include a recognizable polypeptide. We recently illustrated this approach
with the fusion of an avidin polypeptide chain to the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)–
anchoring sequence of human CD14 receptors (24). Biotinylated peptide–coated qdots were
used to label the avidin receptors expressed in the cytoplasmic membrane of HeLa cells. The
receptors were observed with single-molecule sensitivity and were tracked for several minutes
as they diffused in the membrane of live cells and trafficked in the cytosol (Fig. 3) (12). This
approach allowed us to study in detail the relationship between GPI-anchored receptors and
lipid rafts in the membrane (12).
In principle, the same concepts could be used to target and label cytoplasmic or nuclear targets.
However, qdots need to (i) enter the cell cytoplasm and (ii) reach their target without being
trapped in the endocytic pathway (40). A recent study showed that microinjection allows the
delivery of qdots functionalized with the appropriate targeting peptide sequence to
mitochondria or the cell nucleus (54). All other approaches seem to result in aggregation of
qdots in the endosomes, but this is an area of very active research. A second level of difficulty
is introduced by the impossibility of washing away probes that are in excess in the cytoplasm,
as was possible with outer-membrane labeling experiments.
Qdots in Animal Biology
The long-term stability and brightness of qdots make them ideal candidates for live animal
targeting and imaging. Two-photon excitation confocal microscopy was used to image blood
vessels in live mice that had received qdots by intravenous injection, showing that higher
contrast and imaging depth can be obtained at a lower excitation power than with organic dyes
(17). A similar study that focused on long-term imaging of live mice revealed the importance
of coating qdots with high molecular weight polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules to reduce
accumulation in the liver and bone marrow (49). After several months, qdots were still visible
in the bone marrow and lymph nodes of animals, illustrating the outstanding stability of these
probes.
Peptide-qdots were first used to target tissue-specific vascular markers (lung blood vessels and
cancer cells) by intravenous injection in live mice (37). Histological sections of different organs
after 5 or 20 min of circulation showed that peptide-qdots reach their targets and are internalized

by endocytosis in target cells but not in surrounding tissues, probably because of their larger
size relative to dye molecules (which would stain surrounding tissues). Live animal imaging
of targeted qdot delivery was recently achieved in mice by Gao et al., who intravenously
injected PEG-coated qdots functionalized with antibodies to prostate-specific membrane
antigen (26). Because the qdots were emitting in the visible spectrum, a spectral demixing
algorithm was used to separate tissue autofluorescence (59) from qdot signal in grafted tumors
(26). This problem was eliminated altogether by Kim et al., who injected NIR-emitting qdots
(850 nm) intradermally into live mice and pigs (60). Qdots rapidly migrated to nearby lymph
nodes and could be imaged virtually background-free (Fig. 4C), allowing image-guided
resection of a lymph node in a pig. This latter demonstration suggests that IR imaging of qdots
could possibly aid surgical procedures in humans.
Cytotoxicity
Cytotoxicity and the potential interference of qdot labeling with cellular processes are primary
issues in any live-cell or animal experiment. These questions are complicated by the variety
of published synthesis, solubilization, and functionalization protocols. Most of the reports
discussed above did not find adverse effects on cell viability, morphology, function, or
development over the duration of the experiments (from several hours to several days) at qdot
concentrations optimized for labeling efficiency. At higher concentrations, however, effects
on embryo development, for instance, were noticeable (29). The less protected the core or core/
shell material is, the faster the appearance of signs of interference with cell viability or function
(57), with release of Cd2+ or Se2– ion reported in both core and core-shell qdots (52,57). Qdots
are therefore not completely innocuous, but a safe range likely exists in which they can
accomplish their task without major interference with the processes under study. Extensive
scrutiny will naturally be needed before qdots can be used in medical procedures.
Perspectives
The current picture of qdot technology is bound to evolve rapidly on many levels. In synthesis,
new compositions could entail qdots with properties such as (i) sensitivity to electric or
magnetic fields (61,62); (ii) narrower fluorescence emission and longer lifetimes (using
lanthanide-doped qdots); (iii) smaller sizes and extension to the NIR spectrum, as demonstrated
by ternary alloys (63); (iv) end-specific functionalizations of nanorod qdots (64); (v)
suppression of blinking (14) and quantum yield enhancement (65); and (vi) built-in on-off
switches or photoelectric biotransducers. An on-off switch was demonstrated for a maltose
sensor (19) and can be obtained by associating the qdot to a fluorescence-quenching molecule
that can be separated or cleaved upon binding to the target, or in the presence of a chemical
species or enzyme. This would be of particular interest for intracellular applications, in which
there is no way to get rid of unbound qdots (unlike outer cell membrane–labeling experiments).
As an example of a biotransducer, light-excited qdots could transfer their charge to bound
enzymes functioning as electron or hole acceptors, enabling their control by light activation.
Reciprocally, qdots could be lit up by electron or hole donor enzymes through
chemiluminescence (66). Peptide coating of nano-materials is in this respect a powerful tool
for imparting novel functions to the organic-inorganic interface. The simultaneous engineering
of the semiconductor’s band gap (by rational design) with the peptide’s redox potential (by
molecular evolution) could be used to optimize qdot compositions and peptide sequences for
binding and desired optical, electronic, magnetic, and chemical properties. In summary,
different shapes, end specificities, and compositions will lead to more complex bioinorganic
architectures that could be exploited as an optoelectronic interface to the cellular machinery.
Qdot functionalization is another area where new developments will be needed. Ligands of
cellular proteins should be readily cross-linked to qdots by means of standard bioconjugation

schemes. However, most of the potential extracellular or intracellular targets do not have any
known ligands, or if they do, qdots may interfere with their interaction. The use of antibodies,
which has proven successful for surface-bound proteins, may not be practical for intracellular
targets because of the size of the qdot-antibody construct and delivery issues (see below). In
vivo cross-linking strategies developed for dyes—such as the use of biarsenical ligands targeted
against tetracysteine motifs (67), Ni2+–nitrilotriacetic acid moieties targeted against
hexahistidine motifs (68), and other similar approaches (69,70)—may be adapted for qdot
functionalization. The development of affinity pairs orthogonal to the biotin-avidin pair, in
which one component could be easily attached or fused to the target protein, is a promising
approach. Several examples of such pairs developed by molecular evolution have been
reported, with fusion peptides ranging from ~200 amino acids [single chain fragment antibody
targeted against fluorescein, dissociation constant Kd ~ 50 fM (71)] down to ~30 amino acids
[peptide hairpin against Texas Red, Kd ~ 25 pM (72)].
Intracellular delivery remains a challenge, and strategies to escape the endocytosis pathways
will be needed. Two recent publications indicate that peptide-coated qdots could have many
untapped virtues: (i) 20-nm gold nanoparticles coated with protein transduction domains could
enter live cells, and further enter the nucleus with additional adenovirus nuclear localization
and integrin binding domains (73); and (ii) after micro-injection into the cytoplasm, PEG-
coated qdots with a nuclear or mitochondrial localization sequence were successfully targeted
to the nucleus or mitochondria (54). Another interesting model system, based on adenosine
triphosphate–triggered release of CdS qdots encapsulated in chaperonin molecules (74),
suggests using a ‘‘Trojan horse’’ approach to avoid the cellular defense and recycling
mechanisms. Cell-permeable virus capsids, vaults, or other biocapsules could be used to
translocate encapsulated qdots in cells, provided that a simple release-on-demand mechanism
could be engineered in the vehicle, such as a photolyzable or pH-sensitive lock.
Qdots’ photophysical properties (spectral range, brightness, long lifetimes) and their potential
as single-molecule probes may justify the development of new detectors that would have the
temporal resolution and sensitivity of avalanche photodiodes and the 2D spatial resolution of
cameras for wide-field in vivo studies of protein dynamics and trafficking. Their large size and
electronic density may be used for combined fluorescence and static high-resolution imaging
techniques such as atomic force microscopy and electron and x-ray microscopy and
tomography. Additional contrast mechanisms could be obtained by functionalization of qdots.
Figure 4A illustrates this idea with 64Cu radioactive labeling of qdots coated with DOTA
(1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10 tetraacetic acid) functionalized peptides. Micro–
positron emission tomography (microPET) shows that qdots injected into the tail vein in mice
are rapidly accumulated in the liver. Fluorescence imaging of qdots for tracking combined with
the quantitative capability of microPET should therefore permit the elucidation of targeting
mechanisms, biodistribution, and dynamics in living animals with high sensitivity. Nuclear
spin labels for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could also be incorporated into qdot coatings
with the use of similar chelating groups. It should therefore be possible to image targeted qdots
at all scales, from whole-body down to nanometer resolution, using a single probe.
Beyond biotechnological and cell-imaging applications (Fig. 5A), and provided that
cytotoxicity issues can be resolved, one can envision the use of intravenous injection of qdots
to home in on and target cellular markers of diseased tissues and organs in the human body.
Qdots could then be used as contrast reagents for functional imaging with a combination of
MRI, PET, computed tomography, and IR fluorescence imaging (the latter by direct imaging
through the epidermis or by a catheter-based confocal fiber microscope). In vivo optical biopsy
could confirm the pathology, and therapy could then be performed selectively, locally, and
temporally by depositing energy (monochromatic x-rays for k-shell absorption or laser IR
radiation) into the targeted qdots, in a manner similar to the recently reported photothermal

tumor ablation with gold nano-shells (75). Alternatively, it might be possible to graft
therapeutic enzymes to the qdot surface and activate them by light, or produce free radicals
(such as singlet oxygen) by optically cycling the qdots.
Conclusion
Qdots as biological probes have lived up to the hopes of their initial promoters (20,27). They
will not replace the well-established fluorophores or fluorescent protein-fusion technologies,
but will complement them for applications needing better photostability, NIR emission, or
single-molecule sensitivity over long time scales. Undoubtedly, biologists will catch on to these
exciting developments and will find as yet unforeseen applications for this new toolkit, thus
enhancing and complementing their existing arsenal of bioimaging tools.

Fig 1.
(A) Emission maxima and sizes of quantum dots of different composition. Quantum dots can
be synthesized from various types of semiconductor materials (II-VI: CdS, CdSe, CdTe. . .;
III-V: InP, InAs . . .; IV-VI: PbSe. . .) characterized by different bulk band gap energies. The
curves represent experimental data from the literature on the dependence of peak emission
wavelength on qdot diameter. The range of emission wavelength is 400 to 1350 nm, with size
varying from 2 to 9.5 nm (organic passivation/solubilization layer not included). All spectra
are typically around 30 to 50 nm (full width at half maximum). Inset: Representative emission
spectra for some materials. Data are from (12,18,27,76–82). Data for CdHgTe/ZnS have been
extrapolated to the maximum emission wavelength obtained in our group. (B) Absorption
(upper curves) and emission (lower curves) spectra of four CdSe/ZnS qdot samples. The blue
vertical line indicates the 488-nm line of an argon-ion laser, which can be used to efficiently
excite all four types of qdots simultaneously. [Adapted from (28)] (C) Size comparison of qdots
and comparable objects. FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; GFP, green fluorescent protein;
qdot, green (4 nm, top) and red (6.5 nm, bottom) CdSe/ZnS qdot; qrod, rod-shaped qdot (size
from Quantum Dot Corp.’s Web site). Three proteins—streptavidin (SAV), maltose binding
protein (MBP), and immunoglobulin G (IgG)—have been used for further functionalization
of qdots (see text) and add to the final size of the qdot, in conjunction with the solubilization
chemistry (Fig. 2).

Qdot solubilization and functionalization. (A) Surface chemistries. TOPO (trioctylphosphine
oxide)–passivated qdots can be solubilized in aqueous buffer by addition of a layer of
amphiphilic molecules containing hydrophilic (w+) and hydrophobic (w–) moieties, or by
exchange of TOPO with molecules that have a Zn-coordinating end (usually a thiol group, SH)
and a hydrophilic end. Examples of addition include (a) formation of a cross-linked polymer
shell (31), (b) coating with a layer of amphiphilic triblock copolymer (26), and (c) encapsulation
in phospholipid micelles (29). Examples of exchange include (d) mercaptoacetic acid (MAA)
(20), (e) dithiothreitol (DTT) (21), (f) dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA) (33), (g) oligomeric
phosphines (22), (h) cross-linked dendrons (23), and (i) peptides (24). The curved arrow

indicates sites available for further functionalization. (B) Peptide toolkit. The light blue
segment contains cysteines and hydrophobic amino acids ensuring binding to the qdot (24) and
is common to all peptides. S, solubilization sequence; P, PEG; B, biotin; R, peptide recognition
sequence; Q, quencher; D, DOTA; X, any unspecified peptide-encoded function. Qdot
solubilization is obtained by a mixture of S and P. Qdots can be targeted with B, R, or other
chemical moieties. Qdot fluorescence can be turned on or off by attaching a Q via a cleavable
peptide link. In the presence of the appropriate enzyme, the quencher is separated from the
qdot, restoring the photoluminescence and reporting on the enzyme activity. For simultaneous
PET and fluorescence imaging, qdots can be rendered radioactive by D chelation of
radionuclides; for simultaneous MRI and fluorescence imaging, qdots can be rendered
radioactive by D chelation of nuclear spin labels.

Single-particle tracking in a live cell. The brightness and photostability of qdots permit single
qdot observation over a long period of time. Live HeLa cells stably transfected with a plasmid
expressing a chimeric avidin-CD14 receptor (24) were grown on fibronectin-coated glass
coverslips, incubated with biotin-qdots (emission 630 nm), and washed with the observation
medium. The cells were observed by differential interference contrast (DIC) (A) and
epifluorescence (B) on an inverted microscope (Axiovert 100, Zeiss) with a simple Hg lamp
and imaged with a cooled monochrome charge-coupled device camera (CoolSnap HQ, Roper
Scientific). Single qdots were observed to diffuse at characteristically different rates in different
regions of the membrane or inside the cytosol (data not shown). (C) The 1000-step (100 ms/
step) trajectory, R(t), of the qdot localized in the region marked in (A) and (B). (D) The
corresponding qdot intensity, I(t). The blinking pattern (succession of on and off emission)
demonstrates that a single qdot was observed.

Fig 4.
Animal use of qdots. (A and B) microPET and fluorescence imaging of qdots. Qdots having
DOTA (a chelator used for radiolabeling) and 600-dalton PEG on their surface were
radiolabeled with 64Cu (positron-emitting isotope with half-life of 12.7 hours). These qdots
were then injected via the tail vein into nude mice (~80 μCi per animal) and imaged in a small
animal scanner. (A) Rapid and marked accumulation of qdots in the liver quickly follows their
intravenous injection in normal adult nude mice. This could be avoided by functionalizing
qdots with higher molecular weight PEG chains, as other studies have shown (49). (B) Overlay
of DIC and fluorescence images of hepatocytes from a mouse shows the accumulation of qdots
within liver cells. Scale bar, 20 μm. A further step could involve TEM imaging of the precise
localization of qdots in cells, illustrating the potential of qdots as probes at the macro-, micro-,
and nanoscales. (C) Surgical use of NIR qdots. A mouse was injected intradermally with 10
pmol of NIR qdots in the left paw, 5 min after reinjection with 1% isosulfan blue and exposure
of the actual sentinel lymph node. Left, color video; right, NIR fluorescence image. Isosulfan
blue and NIR qdots were localized in the same lymph node (arrows). Copyright 2004 Nature
