A set of oligonucleotide primers capable of initiating enzymatic amplification (polymerase chain reaction) on
a phylogenetically and taxonomically wide range of bacteria is described along with methods for their use and
examples. One pair of primers is capable of amplifying nearly full-length 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) from
many bacterial genera; the additional primers are useful for various exceptional sequences. Methods for
purification of amplified material, direct sequencing, cloning, sequencing, and transcription are outlined. An
obligate intracellular parasite of bovine erythrocytes, Anaplasma marginale, is used as an example; its 16S
rDNA was amplified, cloned, sequenced, and phylogenetically placed. Anaplasmas are related to the genera
Rickettsia and Ehrlichia. In addition, 16S rDNAs from several species were readily amplified from material
found in lyophilized ampoules from the American Type Culture Collection. By use of this method, the
phylogenetic study of extremely fastidious or highly pathogenic bacterial species can be carried out without the
need to culture them. In theory, any gene segment for which polymerase chain reaction primer design is
possible can be derived from a readily obtainable lyophilized bacterial culture.
The comparison of rRNA sequences is a powerful tool for
deducing phylogenetic and evolutionary relationships among
bacteria, archaebacteria, and eucaryotic organisms. These
sequences have been derived previously by methods includ-
ing oligonucleotide cataloging (6), sequencing of clones,
direct sequencing of RNA by using reverse transcriptase
(11), and sequencing of material amplified by polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) (3, 5, 15). The present study expands
on the use of DNA amplification technology for the study of
rRNA sequences within the eubacteria. Several primers are
described, and novel methods for their use are presented.
Sogin and coworkers (15) described a primer pair for the
enzymatic amplification of eucaryotic small-subunit rRNA
gene (rDNA) sequences. Boettger (3) and Edwards and
coworkers (5) examined the sequence of Mycobacterium
bovis 16S rRNA PCR products without cloning. They also
examined a limited set of organisms with their PCR primers:
four gamma purple bacteria and two gram-positive species
with high G+C content were experimentally amplified.
The present study describes primers for the amplification
of most eubacterial 16S rRNAs, details preparation of sam-
ples, and presents our current sequencing procedures.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Nucleic acid preparation. Genomic DNAs were prepared
by using standard methods (13, 14). Preparation of DNA
from lyophilized ampoules consisted of suspending the ly-
ophilized cells in 0.2 ml of 10 mM Tris hydrochloride (pH
8.3)-2.5 mM MgCl2-50 mM KCl. This was added to approx-
imately 0.1 ml of 0.1-mm-diameter acid-washed glass beads,
10 ,u of 20% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and approximately 200
RI of phenol, saturated with the above buffer. This sample
was shaken in a 500-,u microcentrifuge tube, seated within a
2-ml tube, in a Mini-Bead Beater (Biospec Products) for 2
min. After phase separation (10 min at approximately 15,000
x g), the aqueous phase was ethanol precipitated. The pellet
was suspended in 20 to 50 RI of TE buffer (10 mM Tris
hydrochloride [pH 8.0], 1 mM EDTA), and between 2 and

5% of this resuspended DNA was put into the PCR amplifi-
cation.
PCR amplification and purification of product. Approxi-
mately 1 to 3 ,ug of genomic DNA was amplified in a 100-pu
reaction by using the Geneamp kit (U.S. Biochemicals,
Cleveland, Ohio; presently, these kits are only available
from Perkin-Elmer Cetus, Norwalk, Conn.). When the ly-
ophilized ampoule DNA was amplified, 1 plI was routinely
used. Conditions consisted of 25 to 35 cycles of 95°C (2 min),
42°C (30 s), and 72°C (4 min), plus one additional cycle with
a final 20-min chain elongation. The temperature and salt
conditions were not optimized for low inputs of template
DNA. Between 25 and 35 cycles, the number of cycles did
not seem to appreciably affect yield of product. All amplifi-
cations were performed in a Perkin-Elmer temperature con-
troller, although a cursory examination of other instruments
indicated that they may all perform adequately under these
reaction conditions (data not shown). The amplification
products were purified on Centricon 100 columns (Amicon),
by following the specifications of the manufacturer, followed
by ethanol precipitation.
Cloning. Cloning of PCR products was done by using
standard methods (13). Amplified products were partially
purified with spin columns (see above), cleaved at the
appropriate restriction endonuclease sites within the linkers
(see Table 1 and Fig. 1) and ligated into correspondingly
restricted pGEM-3 or pGEM-4 vectors (Promega Corp.,
Madison, Wis.). We were able to successfully clone rDNAs
that had been either agarose gel purified or not gel purified.
Plasmid preparation was performed by using the alkaline
lysis method (2, 13) followed by phenol extraction. For
cloning of PCR products into plasmid vectors, approxi-
mately 20 ,g of plasmid DNA restriction endonuclease cut
with a combination of SalI and BamHI (rarely found inter-
nally within 16S) was dephosphorylated with calf intestinal
alkaline phosphatase, gel purified, and stored frozen. This
vector preparation should be enough for 20 or more cloning
experiments. Anaplasma marginale rDNA was cloned into
the SalI-BamHI site in this manner.
Sequencing methods. The sequencing method of plasmid-
cloned material used the T7 polymerase (Sequenase; U. S.
Biochemicals) kit, and standard procedures were followed

(1; see Sequenase package insert), including the alkaline
denaturation method recommended by the manufacturer.
For sequencing of amplified material directly, four identi-
cal 100-RI amplification reactions were performed on each
sample, with the resultant material being pooled and purified
(see above). A 500-ng amount of template (amplification
product) was combined with 10 ng of primer,
2
,ul of
Sequenase buffer, and water to 10 ,ul. This sample was held
at 98°C for 7 min and cooled to room temperature for 1 min,
and then the labeling reaction was performed at either room
temperature or 37°C for 5 min. (These are slight modifica-
tions of the procedures outlined in reference 19.) Chain
elongation was terminated with sample loading buffer, and
sequencing was performed on buffer-gradient gels (1).
Sequencing primers. Sequencing primers useful for con-
served regions within 16S rDNA genes, both forward and
reverse, have been described previously (11, 20). Forward
primers used in this study spanned positions (Escherichia
coli numbers) (4) as follows: 339 to 357, 785 to 805, 907 to
926, 1391 to 1406. Reverse primers included 357 to 342, 536
to 519, 802 to 785, 926 to 907, 1115 to 1100, 1406 to 1392, and
1513 to 1494.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Primers for 16S rDNA gene amplification. The primers
used for amplification of bacterial 16S rDNA are displayed in
Table 1 as well as in an aligned format in Fig.
1. Their
empirical and theoretical utility are described in Tables 2 and
3. Their implied hybridization is measured against the col-
lection of complete 16S rRNA sequences available to us at
the present time. It would be possible to introduce nucleo-
tide ambiguities during the DNA synthesis of these primers
to obtain a smaller set of primers that would work on
virtually all bacteria, although it is likely that this would
cause the appearance of spurious amplification products.
The primer pair designated fDl and rDl
is capable of
amplifying a wide variety of bacterial taxa. Replacing rDl
with rPl extends the diversity of species even further, but
from the perspective of amplifying the maximum number of
nucleotides of 16S rDNA, rDl is preferable; it is closer to the
3' end.
Amplification of 16S rDNAs from several different bacte-
rial taxa by using different combinations of primers is shown
in Fig. 2. The PCR conditions used in this study were not
rigorously optimized for either specificity or low-input tar-
get. In general, these conditions seem to give a dependable
yield of full-sized product. Additional products of varying
intensities were produced from some of the DNAs. As
shown in Fig. 2, the smaller-sized band produced from
Bacteroides fragilis DNA, derived from both culture and
lyophilized ampoule, is the most abundant spurious band
within the bacterial strains examined. The occurrence of the
additional PCR product in B. fragilis did not interfere with
the ability to clone the 16S rDNA. Of note is the fact that the
only reaction shown in which the rP2 primer was used was
the B. fragilis amplification;
in another experiment (not
shown), the same spurious band was produced when primer
rPl was substituted for rP2.
A. marginale 16S rRNA. To test the
utility of these
methods for phylogenetic study, A. marginale, a member of
the Rickettsiales, was used as an example. A. marginale is
an obligate intracellular, erythrocytic, arthropod-transmitted
parasite whose pathogenic range includes several ruminant
species (16). Previous attempts at sequencing directly from
the RNA isolated from Renografin-purified A. marginale
cells (supplied by J. Samuel, Pullman, Wash.) were unsuc-
cessful (data not shown). Attempts at cloning into lambda
phage vectors also were without success. A DNA prepara-
tion (by standard phenol methods) (13, 14) from this same
gradient-purified material was used for amplification. By
using the generally applicable primer pair, fDl
+ rDl,
amplification of the 16S rDNA of A. marginale was enabled.
The 16S rRNA sequence determined for A. marginale is
shown in Fig. 1, aligned with E. coli and with the primers.
Approximately 250 nucleotides of sequence were initially
determined directly from PCR-amplified material by using a
primer located at position 519 (E. coli numbers) (4), reading
toward the 5' end of the molecule. After cloning the ampli-
fication product into a pGEM vector, that same sequence
was again determined to validate the accuracy of the direct
sequencing, without disagreement. Aligning the sequence
with the accepted secondary structure (8, 25) indicated a
deleted helix within the 455 to 480 region (E. coli numbers)
(4) characteristic of a few bacterial groups
(8,
25). The
complete A. marginale 16S rRNA sequence was determined
from the cloned amplification product. The structure of the
helices between positions 180 and 220 (E. coli numbers) (4)
strongly suggested that this was a member of the alpha
subdivision of the purple bacteria. Similarity and evolution-
ary distance data (Table 4) prove A. marginale to be related
to other Rickettsiales within the alpha subdivision of the
purple bacteria (19, 21), specifically related to the genera
Rickettsia and Ehrlichia (19). A phylogenetic tree displaying
this three-way relationship is shown in Fig. 3.

sequences.

a Primers are considered applicable if there is a perfect match for approximately 15 bases at the 3' end of the primer. The list is definitive only in the sense that
the taxa mentioned represent the sequences available to the authors. The absence of a genus from the list does not imply that the primer will not work. Because
the majority of the available rRNA sequences are derived from direct sequencing of rRNAs with reverse transcriptase, there is far less information available about
the 3' end of the 16S. In some cases, the indicated genus is represented by numerous species; in other cases the indicated genus is represented by only one. The
sequence alignment from which these data were derived is unpublished (12, 24). Phylogenetic groupings are those of Woese (23).
A. marginale has historically been a difficult organism to
study (16) because of the lack of a culture system.
Its
phylogenetic placement, which was made possible by ampli-
fication with broad-specificity 16S rDNA PCR primers, has
implications which should shed light on the biology of this
fastidious pathogen. Many properties found in the genera
Rickettsia or Ehrlichia, such as the utilization of host ATP
(22), may also be characteristic of the genus Anaplasma.
Obviously, the sequence of the 16S rRNA of A. marginale
provides basic information useful for designing probes or
PCR primers specific for the detection of this veterinary
pathogen.
As shown with A. marginale, a potential advantage of this
technology in the study of bacterial phylogeny is the ability
to work with relatively small numbers of cells. This ability is
of greatest use when the target species is either extremely
fastidious or highly pathogenic. In the case of A. marginale,
obtaining sufficient material for phylogenetic study would
have required the sacrifice of several cows; this is the only
established culture system. It is also highly desirable to keep
culture volumes small when dealing with highly infectious
organisms such as respiratory pathogens.

The last four species listed above were also amplified with a
forward primer similar to fD1; its rDNA-like sequence was
that of fDl, but the linker was replaced with a T7 promoter
sequence (see discussion of transcription below). The fact
that Y. enterocolitica amplified with this primer suggests
that, under the right conditions, one forward and one or two
reverse primers may amplify almost all of the eubacterial 16S
rDNAs. A similar interchangeability of primers was found
with Campylobacterjejuni rDNA (data not shown).

mately 60 nucleotides at the 3' end of 16S rRNA cannot be
sequenced directly from the rRNA.) (ii) A total of 226 bases
were determined from a Neisseria gonorrhoeae PCR clone,
with no disagreement with the RNA sequence or a published
rDNA sequence (17). (iii) The sequence from the Neisseria
meningitidis clone showed no disagreement with 250 bases
of RNA-derived sequence. One N from the RNA sequence
was now determinable from the clone. (iv) In 212 bases of a
Chlamydia trachomatis sequence, there was no disagree-
ment with the conventionally cloned sequence (unpublished
data). (v) In a C. jejuni PCR-derived clone, 328 bases were
inspected, and there was one discrepancy with the RNA-
derived sequence (an A-to-G transition) which may be the
result of minor cistron-to-cistron variation. Five N's were
resolved.
In summary, there appears to be no reason for more than
the usual concern, because of Taq polymerase fidelity of
replication, about sequence accuracy in this method. Several
positions that had previously been scored as unknown or
ambiguous are now determinable by taking advantage of
bidirectional gene sequencing and the absence of artifacts
due to rRNA secondary structure and posttranscriptionally
modified nucleotides. As always, a cautious approach should
be taken by checking any sequence anomalies and con-
firming known
secondary
structural
constraints
on
se-
quences.
Although we have spent considerable time optimizing and
testing the direct sequencing of PCR-amplified rDNA, we
highly recommend cloning the fragments if a near-perfect
sequence is desired.
Transcription of amplified material. One additional appli-
cation of primers similar to those described herein is the in
vitro transcription of PCR-amplified material. We have tran-
scribed virtually full-length pseudo-rRNA from both cloned
material and directly from amplified product (not shown).
Cloned rDNAs, in pGEM vectors, were transcribed by using
either T7 or SP6 polymerases, depending on clone orienta-
tion. In addition, PCR primers similar to fDl, in which the
cloning linker was replaced with a T7 promoter sequence
(5'-TTAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-followed by the 16S
rDNA-like sequence), readily amplified and transcribed full-
length pseudo-rRNA. This material can be used for sequenc-
ing, hybridization studies (data not shown), or potentially for
reconstitution experiments.
Conclusion. The amplification by PCR of a taxonomically
diverse collection of eubacterial 16S rDNA genes is possible
with a small number of primers. These products can readily
be cloned for sequencing or they can be sequenced directly.
The ability to determine rRNA sequences from ATCC
lyophilized ampoules, without culture, enables the study of
fastidious or pathogenic species without employing tricky or
expensive microbiological methods. While this should not be
a routine substitute for growing bacteria, picking individual
colonies, and confirming their phenotypic and biochemical
identities, it will enable experiments to be performed that
were not previously possible.
