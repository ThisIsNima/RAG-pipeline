WebLogo generates sequence logos, graphical representations of the patterns within a multiple sequence alignment.
Sequence logos provide a richer and more precise description of sequence similarity than consensus sequences and
can rapidly reveal significant features of the alignment otherwise difficult to perceive. Each logo consists of stacks of
letters, one stack for each position in the sequence. The overall height of each stack indicates the sequence
conservation at that position (measured in bits), whereas the height of symbols within the stack reflects the relative
frequency of the corresponding amino or nucleic acid at that position. WebLogo has been enhanced recently with
additional features and options, to provide a convenient and highly configurable sequence logo generator. A
command line interface and the complete, open WebLogo source code are available for local installation and
customization.
Sequence logos were invented by Tom Schneider and Mike Ste-
phens (Schneider and Stephens 1990; Shaner et al. 1993) to dis-
play patterns in sequence conservation, and to assist in discov-
ering and analyzing those patterns. As an example, the accom-
panying figure (Fig. 1) shows how WebLogo can help interpret
the sequence-specific binding of the protein CAP to its DNA rec-
ognition site (Schultz et al. 1991). Homodimeric DNA-binding
proteins typically display a symmetric double hump in the DNA
binding-site logo (Schneider and Stephens 1990), as shown in the
figure. Deviations from this basic pattern can indicate additional
features; a highly conserved residue in the center of such a pat-
tern may indicate DNA distortion or base flipping (Schneider
2001); an unexpectedly high-sequence conservation may be due
to overlapping binding sites (Schneider et al. 1986). Protein logos
can illuminate patterns of amino acid conservation that are often
of structural or functional importance (Galperin et al. 2001; Rig-
den et al. 2003). Sequence logos have also been used to display
patterns in the BLOCKS protein sequence database (Henikoff et
al. 1995), and in DNA-binding site motifs (Robison et al. 1998;
Nelson et al. 2002), to analyze splice sites (Stephens and
Schneider 1992; Emmert et al. 2001), and in a variety of other
contexts. Additional examples, and the raw data for the example
presented here, can be found on the WebLogo examples page
(http://weblogo.berkeley.edu/examples.html).
The logo generation form (http://weblogo.berkeley.edu/
logo.cgi) can process RNA, DNA, or protein multiple sequence
alignments provided in either FASTA (Pearson and Lipman 1988)
or CLUSTAL (Higgins and Sharp 1988) formats. If the user does
not explicitly specify the sequence type, then WebLogo will
make a determination on the basis of the symbols found within
the sequences. A logo represents each column of the alignment
by a stack of letters, with the height of each letter proportional to
the observed frequency of the corresponding amino acid or
nucleotide, and the overall height of each stack proportional to
the sequence conservation, measured in bits, at that position.
The letters of each stack are ordered from most to least frequent,
so that one may read the consensus sequence from the tops of
the stacks. For example, the figure shows that the CAP binding-
site consensus sequence is AA-TGTGA------TCACA-TT.
Schneider and Stephens (1990) define the sequence conser-
vation at a particular position in the alignment, Rseq, as the dif-
ference between the maximum possible entropy and the entropy
of the observed symbol distribution:
Rseq = Smax −Sobs = log2 N −−
n=1
N
pn log2 pn
Here, pn is the observed frequency of symbol n at a particular
sequence position and N is the number of distinct symbols for
the given sequence type, either four for DNA/RNA or 20 for pro-
tein. Consequently, the maximum sequence conservation per
site is log2 4 = 2 bits for DNA/RNA and log2 20 ≈4.32 bits for
proteins. If we neglect the intersite correlations and assume a
uniform background symbol distribution, then the total entropy
of the logo, the sum of the sequence conservation at each posi-
tion, measures the information content of the logo. For binding
sites, this total entropy has, in many cases, been shown to be
approximately equal to the amount of information needed to
locate the binding site within the relevant stretch of DNA
(Schneider et al 1986). For a nonuniform background distribu-
tion, such as found in protein sequences or the genomes of many
hyperthermophiles, the information content would be given by
the relative entropy between the observed and background dis-
tributions (Cover and Thomas 1991; Gorodkin et al. 1997;
Stormo 1998).
Limited sequence data results in a systematic underestima-
tion of the entropy, which becomes significant if the multiple
alignment contains fewer than about 20 nucleotide or 40 protein
sequences. By default, WebLogo incorporates a small sample cor-
rection (Schneider et al. 1986), which can, in part, ameliorate this
bias. In addition, WebLogo can optionally display error bars with
heights twice this correction, which gives some idea of the sam-
pling errors made. Note that the error bars may not have uniform
height across the logo, as the magnitude of the small sample
correction depends on the number of symbols observed at each
position. This will vary due to the presence of gaps in the align-
ment.
A standard sequence logo does not provide any indication of
correlations between different positions of the alignment. In gen-
eral, such intersite correlations are relatively insignificant in bio-
logical sequences (Schneider 1997; Stormo 1998), but there are
exceptions, such as base-paired sites in folded RNA structures.
Structural logos (Gorodkin et al. 1997), an extension of the se-
quence logo idea, display part of this additional level of detail.
The symbols that compose the stacks display colors accord-
ing to the chemical species they represent. The default colors for

nucleotides are G, orange; T and U, red; C, blue; and A, green.
Amino acids have colors according to their chemical properties
(Lewin 1994); polar amino acids (G, S, T, Y, C, Q, N) show as
green, basic (K, R, H) blue, acidic (D, E) red, and hydrophobic (A,
V, L, I, P, W, F, M) amino acids as black. The user may customize
the coloring scheme, or select a simple black and white option.
WebLogo can create output in several common graphics’
formats, including the bitmap formats GIF and
PNG, suitable for on-screen display, and the vector
formats EPS and PDF, more suitable for printing,
publication, and further editing. Additional graph-
ics options include bitmap resolution, titles, op-
tional axis, and axis labels, antialiasing, error bars,
and alternative symbol formats.
The Web site is available to all users without
fee. Those who would prefer to run WebLogo on a
local server may obtain a command line interface
version with source code (distributed under an
Open Source license). We welcome bug reports and
suggestions for additional features. Please send

(A) CAP (Catabolite Activator Protein, also known as CRP) acts as a transcription
promoter by binding at more than 100 sites within the Escherichia coli genome. We
rendered the PDB structure 1CGP (Schultz et al. 1991) using Chimera (Huang et al. 1996).
(B) The two DNA recognition helices of the CAP homodimer insert themselves into con-
secutive turns of the major groove. Several consequences can be observed in this CAP
binding-site logo. The logo is approximately palindromic, which provides two very similar
recognition sites, one for each subunit of the dimer. However, the binding site lacks perfect
symmetry, possibly due to the inherent asymmetry of the operon promoter region. The
displacement of the two halves is 11 bp, or approximately one full turn of the DNA helix.
Additional interactions occur between the protein and the first and last two bases within
the DNA minor groove, where the protein cannot easily distinguish A from T, or G from C
(Seeman et al. 1976). The data for this logo consists of 59 binding sites determined by
DNA footprinting (Robison et al. 1998). (C) The helix-turn-helix motif from the CAP family
of homodimeric DNA binding proteins (Brennan and Matthews 1989; Schultz et al. 1991).
Positions 180, 181, and 185 are known to interact directly with bases in the major groove
(Schultz et al. 1991; Parkinson et al. 1996) and are critical to the sequence-specific binding
of the protein. The conserved glycine at position 177 is located inside of the turn between
the helices, where packing effects prevent the insertion of a side chain. Partially or com-
pletely buried positions (labeled B) frequently contain hydrophobic amino acids, which are
colored black. The data for this logo consists of 100 sequences from the full Pfam (Bateman
et al. 2002) alignment of this family (Accession no. PF00325). We removed a few se-
quences with rare insertions for convenience.
