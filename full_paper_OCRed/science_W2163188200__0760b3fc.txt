Cancers arise owing to the accumulation of mutations in critical
genes that alter normal programmes of cell proliferation, differ-
entiation and death. As the ﬁrst stage of a systematic genome-
wide screen for these genes, we have prioritized for analysis
signalling pathways in which at least one gene is mutated in
human cancer. The RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK–MAP kinase pathway
mediates cellular responses to growth signals1. RAS is mutated to
an oncogenic form in about 15% of human cancer. The three RAF
genes code for cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinases that are
regulated by binding RAS1–3. Here we report BRAF somatic
missense mutations in 66% of malignant melanomas and at
lower frequency in a wide range of human cancers. All mutations
are within the kinase domain, with a single substitution (V599E)
accounting for 80%. Mutated BRAF proteins have elevated kinase
activity and are transforming in NIH3T3 cells. Furthermore, RAS
function is not required for the growth of cancer cell lines with
the V599E mutation. As BRAF is a serine/threonine kinase that is
commonly activated by somatic point mutation in human cancer,
it may provide new therapeutic opportunities in malignant
melanoma.
Genomic DNA from 15 cancer cell lines (6 breast cancers, 1 small-
cell lung cancer (SCLC), 6 non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC), 1
mesothelioma, 1 melanoma) and the corresponding matched lym-
phoblastoid cell lines from the same individuals were screened for
sequence variants through the coding exons and intron–exon
junctions of the BRAF gene using a capillary-based modiﬁed
heteroduplex method followed by direct sequencing of polymerase
chain reaction products. (Exon 1, containing 135 base pairs (bp) of
coding sequence, failed to amplify despite the use of ﬁve different
primer sets.) Three single-base substitutions were detected. Two
were in BRAF exon 15: T1796A leading to a substitution of valine by
glutamic acid at position 599 (V599E) in the melanoma cell line
Colo-829, and C1786G leading to L596V in the NSCLC cell line
NCI-H2087 (Fig. 1). A further mutation was found in exon 11:
G1403C leading to G468A in the NSCLC cell line NCI-H1395. None
of the three changes were present in the lymphoblastoid cell lines
from the same individuals, indicating that the variants were soma-
tically acquired mutations.

To evaluate further the pattern of somatic mutations in BRAF, we
screened the coding sequence and intron–exon junctions for
mutations in genomic DNA from an additional 530 cancer cell
lines (Table 1). Presumptive BRAF mutations (excluding variants of
unknown signiﬁcance and germline polymorphisms that were
found in 341 normal tissue DNAs) were identiﬁed in 43 cancer
cell lines including 20 of 34 (59%) melanomas, 7 of 40 (18%)
colorectal cancers, 4 of 38 (11%) gliomas, 4 of 131 (3%) lung
cancers (all four were adenocarcinomas from a total of 35), 5 of 59
(9%) sarcomas, 1 of 26 (4%) ovarian carcinomas, 1 of 45 (2%)
breast cancers and 1 of 7 (14%) liver cancers. Mutations were not
found in cancer cell lines derived from 29 neuroblastomas, 10
bladder cancers, 53 leukaemias and lymphomas, 11 cervical carci-
nomas, 11 renal cell carcinomas, 3 pancreatic carcinomas, 3 prostate
carcinomas, 6 gastric carcinomas, 7 testicular carcinomas, 3 uterine
carcinomas and 29 other cancers.
All 43 probable oncogenic BRAF somatic mutations found in the
cancer cell lines were in exons 11 and 15 (Table 1). Accordingly,
these two exons were screened for mutations in genomic DNA from
378 primary human cancers and short-term cultures (STC, less than
passage 15). BRAF mutations were detected in 28 primary cancers/
STCs, including 6 of 9 primary melanomas, 12 of 15 melanoma
STCs, 4 of 33 colorectal carcinomas, 5 of 35 ovarian neoplasms (see
Fig. 1 for example), and 1 of 182 sarcomas. Mutations were not
detected in 33 breast cancers, 15 gliomas, 23 prostate cancers, 14
lung cancers, or 19 head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. Ten of
the 35 ovarian tumours examined were classiﬁed as borderline (low
malignant potential) lesions and 4 of 5 BRAF mutations found in
ovarian neoplasms were in this subcategory. The single primary
sarcoma in which a BRAF mutation was found was classiﬁed as a
malignant ﬁbrous histiocytoma.
Although BRAF mutations are found in a wide range of cancers,
there is a trend towards the occurrence of mutations in cancer types
in which a substantial proportion of cases are known to harbour
RAS mutations (for example, malignant melanoma, colorectal
cancer and borderline ovarian cancers4–6). The apparent association
between the presence of BRAF and RAS mutations in similar cancer
types suggests that activation of the RAS–RAF–mitogen-activated
protein (MAP)-kinase kinase (MEK)–extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (ERK)–MAP kinase pathway can be achieved by mutation at
various levels in the pathway and that the pathway is activated in a
substantial proportion of cases in these cancer types.
The highest frequency of BRAF mutations is in malignant
melanoma (Table 1). This does not seem to be related to the effects
of ultraviolet light, the only known environmental risk factor for
this disease. The T ! A change at nucleotide 1796, which accounts
for 35 of 38 (92%) of BRAF mutations in melanoma (Table 1), is
distinct from the CC ! TT or C ! T changes associated with
pyrimidine dimer formation following exposure to ultraviolet
light—these changes are commonly found, for example, in the
TP53 gene in non-melanoma skin cancers7.
The high frequency of mutation in melanoma may be related to
features of melanocyte biology. a-melanocyte stimulating-hor-
mone and other related proopiomelanocortin-derived peptides
are crucial regulators in melanocyte biology. a-melanocyte stimu-
lating-hormone and proopiomelanocortin-derived peptides bind
to the melanocortin receptor I, upregulating cyclic AMP, leading to
increased proliferation and melanogenesis in response to UVB
radiation8. This cAMP-dependent signalling cascade activates
BRAF and subsequently ERK9. That a principal melanocyte-speciﬁc
signalling pathway controlling proliferation and differentiation
operates through activation of BRAF and that this gene is mutated
in most melanomas suggests a possible explanation for the high
frequency of BRAF mutation in melanomas relative to other cancer
types.
Our analysis reveals mutations in two regions of the BRAF kinase
domain. Mutations were very similarly distributed in cancer cell
lines and primary cancers. A total of 89% of mutations are within or
immediately adjacent to the activation segment, a region of 10–30
amino acids bounded by almost invariant DFG and APE motifs10.
Acidic substitutions at a single amino acid residue (usually V599E
and one instance of V599D) account for 92% of activation segment
mutations with ﬁve further mutations altering residues E585, F594,
G595 and L596 (Table 1). These residues are identical at the

equivalent positions in human RAF1 and ARAF1 and are conserved
in all three RAF genes through evolution (with the exception of the
BRAF V599 residue in the Drosophila Raf homologue; Fig. 2). A
total of 11% of mutations are in the glycine residues (G463, G465
and G468) of the GXGXXG motif within the glycine-rich loop of the
kinase domain. This motif is highly conserved in protein kinases
and other proteins that bind mono- and dinucleotides (Fig. 2). The
ﬁrst glycine is present in about 95% of all kinases, the second in
more than 99% of all kinases and the third in about 85% of
kinases11. From structural studies, it has been shown that this region
forms a loop that anchors the b- and g-phosphates of ATP and may
orientate ATP for catalysis10. Previously described mutants of these
glycine residues in other proteins have resulted in reduction of
kinase activity12–14. In the GTP-binding RAS proteins, however,
mutation of G12 within the GXGXXG motif is still compatible with
nucleotide binding and results in RAS proteins with transforming
activity.
To characterize the biological effects of these mutations, we
examined the V599E mutation—because it was the most com-
mon—together with one other mutant chosen from the activation
segment (L596V) and two mutants of the G loop (G463V, G468A).
Myc-epitope-tagged versions of complementary DNAs containing
these mutations were transiently expressed in COS cells, immuno-
precipitated using the Myc-tag and examined in a kinase cascade
assay using bacterially produced glutathione S-transferase (GST)–
MEK, GST–ERK and myelin basic protein (MBP) as sequential
substrates15,16. All four mutants had elevated basal kinase activity
compared with wild-type BRAF (WTBRAF, Fig. 3a); however, the
basal activity of G468ABRAF and V599EBRAF was substantially higher
(about 12.5- and 10.7-fold that of WTBRAF, respectively), whereas
the activation of G463VBRAF and L596VBRAF was more modest
(about 2- and 5.7-fold, respectively). All four BRAF proteins also
stimulated the activity of endogenous ERK when expressed in COS
cells as determined by a phospho-speciﬁc antibody that only binds
to the dually phosphorylated activated form of ERK1/2 (Fig. 3b).
Consistent with their in vitro activities, G468ABRAF and V599EBRAF
stimulated phosphorylation of endogenous ERK1/2 more strongly
than G463VBRAF or L596VBRAF. The data demonstrate that these
mutants are active in vitro and stimulate the activity of the pathway
in vivo to different degrees. Finally, all four mutants were also
stimulated by G12VHRAS, although the fold activation for each of
the mutants is reduced compared with WTBRAF (see Fig. 3a).
L596VBRAF (about 4.5-fold stimulation by G12VHRAS) was stimu-
lated more strongly than the other mutants tested (between 2- and
2.5-fold stimulation) (Fig. 3a).
The ability of the kinase-activated BRAF mutants to induce
transformation was examined by transfection of the epitope-tagged
cDNA constructs into NIH3T3 cells to assay focus-forming ability.
WTBRAF transformed cells at very low efﬁciency (0.0013 foci per
ng DNA); however, G463VBRAF, G468ABRAF, L596VBRAF and
V599EBRAF transformed NIH3T3 cells 70–138 times (0.09–0.18
foci per ng DNA) more efﬁciently than WTBRAF (Table 2). Inhibit-

ing activity, showing that this was dependent on kinase activity.
Despite the higher kinase activity of V599EBRAF compared with
WTBRAF activated by G12VHRAS, V599EBRAF has 50-fold lower
transforming activity than G12VHRAS in this assay. This may reﬂect
the fact that whereas RAS signals to a number of effector mol-
ecules18, RAF proteins may signal predominantly through the ERK–
MAPK pathway (although other effectors have been proposed2,3,18).
In addition to focus assays, NIH3T3 cells transfected with
G463VBRAF and G468ABRAF were assayed for tumorigenicity in
nude mice. 106 transfected cells pooled from puromycin-resistant
colonies produced 5-mm tumours within 18 days (data not shown).
Our results demonstrate that mutations of BRAF found in
human cancers activate the kinase. Phosphorylation of residues
within the activation segment regulates the activity of many kinases
including BRAF10. In BRAF, T598 and S601 within the activation
segment both require phosphorylation to achieve maximal kinase
activity. These phosphorylations are effected after recruitment of
BRAF to the membrane by activated RAS, and replacement of T598
and S601 by acidic amino acid residues results in RAS-independent
activation of BRAF17. The V599 mutations found in human cancers
probably mimic phosphorylation in the activation segment as they
insert a negatively charged residue adjacent to a site of regulatory
phosphorylation at S598. Notably, although many studies in experi-
mental systems show that regulatory phosphorylations can be
mimicked by substitution of an acidic amino acid, such mutations
are probably rare in human disease, because an acidic amino acid
substitution cannot be generated from a threonine or serine residue
by a single base change. Our data now suggest that amino acids
other than threonine and serine can be mutated to acidic residues in
human disease to mimic phosphorylation and hence activate
kinases. Although the mode of action of V599 mutations may be
explicable on the basis of mimicking regulatory phosphorylation,
the mechanism of action of the other activation loop mutations is
not clear and awaits structural studies. Moreover, the presence in
one cancer cell line of an unusual double nucleotide substitution
converting V599 to aspartic acid suggests as well that mutations at
V599 may be particularly active biologically. Indeed, K600 could be
changed by a single base substitution to glutamic acid, yet
mutations at this residue have not been found in human cancers.
Our data also demonstrate that mutations of the glycine residues
in the GXGXXG motif of the ATP-binding domain can activate
kinases. It will be interesting to determine whether mutation of
these conserved glycine residues activates other protein kinases and
nucleotide-binding proteins. If this proves to be the case then it will
provide a useful way to generate constitutively activated kinases
experimentally.
The coding exons and intron–exon junctions of HRAS, KRAS and
NRAS genes were screened for mutations through the entire panel of
545 cell lines. Seventy-one (13%) had mutations of RAS genes: 14 of
40 (35%) colorectal cancers, 23 of 131 (18%) lung cancers (22
NSCLC, 1 SCLC), 3 of 3 (100%) pancreatic cancers, 3 of 34 (9%)
melanomas, 4 of 26 (15%) ovarian cancers, 3 of 27 (11%) neuro-
blastomas, 2 of 10 (20%) bladder cancers, 9 of 53 (17%) leukaemias/
lymphomas and 10 of 221 others. Three of 43 cancer cell lines with
BRAF mutations also had RAS gene mutations: BE, a colorectal
cancer cell line (KRAS2 G13D; BRAF G463V); Hx62/26, an ovarian
cancer cell line (KRAS2 G13D; BRAF G463E); and the NCI-H2087
NSCLC line (NRAS Q61K; BRAF L596V). Mutation screening of the
22 primary cancers with BRAF mutations for which adequate
material was available revealed a colorectal cancer with coincident
KRAS2 (G12V) and BRAF (F594L) mutations. The four cancers that
had coincident RAS and BRAF mutations (3 cell lines, 1 primary
tumour) were all from the set of 12 screened that had one of the less
common BRAF mutations. Conversely, none of the 51 cancer
samples with a V599 mutation screened through the RAS genes
contained a RAS mutation (see Supplementary Information). This
suggests that the common V599E mutation is biologically distinct
from the other BRAF mutations.
Studies using injection of the RAS-neutralizing Y13-259 mono-
clonal antibody have previously shown that most normal cells
examined and some tumour cells require RAS function for pro-

liferation in culture19,20. Microinjection of Y13-259 into eight cell
lines with the V599E mutation and the cell line with V599D did not
block their proliferation in culture (Table 3). However, three cell
lines tested with less common BRAF mutations (two of which had
RAS mutations and one of which did not, Table 3) were inhibited by
Y13-259 microinjection. These data suggest that BRAF V599
mutations uncouple cells from their proliferation requirement of
RAS (although our in vitro data indicate that BRAF V599 mutants
can be even further activated by mutant RAS), whereas other BRAF
mutants remain dependent on RAS function. One interpretation of
these results is that the less common BRAF mutants still require
interaction with RAS to become phosphorylated and activated,
whereas V599 mutants overcome the need for a RAS-dependent
step by mimicking phosphorylation. The coincidence of RAS and
BRAF mutants in the same cancer cell is, to our knowledge, the ﬁrst
report of tandem-activating mutations in more than one com-
ponent of this signalling pathway. The observation prompts the
speculation that mutant RAS signalling may be modulated by
mutations at other locations in the pathway.
RAF proteins phosphorylate MEK1/2, which in turn phosphor-
ylate ERK1/2. To evaluate whether activating mutations of BRAF
signal through MEK and ERK, we treated cells with the MEK1/2
inhibitor U0126 (ref. 21). This compound inhibits DNA synthesis in
a wide variety of cell types21. Of those cancer cell lines in which
treatment with U0126 blocked ERK1/2 phosphorylation by at least
80%, 6 of 6 with either V599E or V599D mutations showed strong
inhibition of DNA synthesis (Table 3). These results are therefore
consistent with the hypothesis that the activated versions of BRAF
signal, at least in part, through the classical MAPK cascade to
promote proliferation.
Examination of the exons and splice junctions of RAF1 in the set
of 545 cancer cell lines did not reveal evidence of frequent mutations
in melanoma or any other cancer. BRAF may be preferred as a
mutational target because it has a higher basal kinase activity than
RAF1 (ref. 15). Indeed, when we introduced the BRAF mutations
found in human cancers into the cognate positions in RAF1, they
had at least 10-fold lower activity in kinase and transformation assays
(data not shown). This may be due to the fact that RAF1 requires
phosphorylation on serine 338 and tyrosine 341 for activation of the
kinase15. By contrast, in BRAF, the equivalent serine (S445) is
constitutively phosphorylated and the position equivalent to the
tyrosine is substituted by an aspartic acid residue (D448), which acts
as a phosphomimetic. Thus BRAF may require fewer post-transla-
tional modiﬁcations than RAF1 to achieve maximal kinase activity
and hence is more susceptible to oncogenic activation.
We have identiﬁed BRAF as an oncogene in human cancer. The
pattern and activity of mutations observed is likely to yield new
insights into kinase function. There has recently been marked
success reported of an inhibitor (STI571) of the BCR-ABL kinase
in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia22. The high fre-
quency of BRAF mutations in melanoma and the relative lack of
effective therapies for advanced stages of this disease suggest that
inhibition of BRAF activity may be an important new strategy in the
treatment of metastatic melanoma. The identiﬁcation of BRAF as a
commonly mutated target in human cancer at such an early stage of
our genome-wide screen suggests that systematic searches through
cancer cell genomes for somatic mutations ultimately will provide a
much more complete picture of the number and patterns of
mutations underlying human oncogenesis.
A
Methods
Tissue samples
Normal and neoplastic tissue samples were obtained from publicly available banks in the
case of cell lines, and from individual investigators using appropriate local Institutional
Review Board approved protocols/ethical approval procedures for tissue collection in the
case of primary tumour material. Cord blood controls were obtained from the North
Cumbria Community Genetics Project (NCCGP). All 545 cancer cell lines and the 15
normal lymphoblastoid lines were genotyped using 400 polymorphic microsatellites (ABI
linkage MD-10 panel) to conﬁrm both matching of normal and tumour cell lines as well as
non-duplication of cell lines.
Mutation screening
Screening for mutations was performed using a capillary-based modiﬁed heteroduplex
method optimized to run on an ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyser23 (H.D., manuscript in
preparation). PCR primers were designed to amplify the exon plus at least 50 bp of
ﬂanking intronic sequence (see Supplementary Information for primer sequences). A total
of 12 ng genomic DNA from the test sample was mixed with 3 ng control genomic DNA
and ampliﬁed using standard PCR conditions in which one of the primers was labelled
with either FAM, NED or VIC dye. The resulting samples were then analysed on an ABI
PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyser under semi-denaturing conditions using optimized
separation medium and run conditions. The resulting traces were analysed using
proprietary software to identify samples that produced a shift in peak migration relative to
either the matched normal control from the same individual or a standard normal control,
indicating the presence of a putative sequence variation. Samples that produced a
heteroduplex shift were directly sequenced on both strands using BigDye terminator Cycle
Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol, and analysed on an ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyser.
RAS-neutralizing antibody microinjection and U0126 treatment
Tumour cells were seeded at a density such that they were approximately 50% conﬂuent on
the day of injection. Cells were microinjected with Y13-259 or control immunoglobulin-g
as described previously24. Twenty hours after microinjection cells were labelled with 5-
bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) for 24 h, ﬁxed and stained with antibody against BrdU. We
scored at least 100 microinjected cells for each experiment. To determine the effects of
inhibiting ERK1/2 activation on proliferation of tumour cells in culture, cells were seeded
on day 1 then the following day U0126 was added in DMSO to 10 mM; after 20 h BrdU was
added for a further 24 h before ﬁxation and staining with antibody against BrdU. Lysates
were also made from cells treated in parallel to study the level of inhibition of ERK1/2
phosphorylation by western blotting with an antibody speciﬁc for the di-phosphorylated
activated forms of ERK1/2 (clone MAP-YT; Sigma).
Transformation assays
1.3 £ 105 cells of clone D4 of NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with 15–450 ng BRAF
expression plasmids in pEFm6 (ref. 17) together with 50 ng pBabe Puro and sufﬁcient
empty pEFm6 to give a total of 700 ng DNA, using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). After 24–
26 h, cells were trypsinized and divided between two 10-cm tissue culture dishes
containing DMEM plus 5% donor calf serum (focus assay) and two 10-cm dishes
containing 2.5 mg ml21 puromycin in DMEM plus 5% donor calf serum (transformed
colony assay). The medium of the focus assays was changed every four days whereas the
medium of the transformed colony assay was changed after seven days. Plates were scored,
by experimenters ‘blind’ for transformation, after 12–18 days. 106 cells from pooled
colonies of cells from the puromycin-selected dishes were injected subcutaneously into
male nude mice aged over six weeks. Mice were observed twice weekly and killed when
tumours reached a size in excess of 5 £ 5 mm.
BRAF activity assays
Myc-epitope-tagged versions of BRAF were transiently expressed in COS cells using the
reagent lipofectamine (Gibco/BRL) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell
extracts were prepared and the Myc-epitope-tagged protein kinase activity was
determined as described previously15,16. Western blotting for ERK and ppERK was
performed as described15,16.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a principal reg-
ulator of blood vessel formation and haematopoiesis1,2, but the
mechanisms by which VEGF differentially regulates these pro-
cesses have been elusive. Here we describe a regulatory loop by
which VEGF controls survival of haematopoietic stem cells
(HSCs). We observed a reduction in survival, colony formation
and in vivo repopulation rates of HSCs after ablation of the VEGF
gene in mice. Intracellularly acting small-molecule inhibitors of
VEGF receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase dramatically reduced
colony formation of HSCs, thus mimicking deletion of the VEGF
gene. However, blocking VEGF by administering a soluble
VEGFR-1, which acts extracellularly, induced only minor effects.
These ﬁndings support the involvement in HSC survival of a
VEGF-dependent internal autocrine loop mechanism (that is, the
mechanism is resistant to inhibitors that fail to penetrate the
intracellular compartment). Not only ligands selective for VEGF
and VEGFR-2 but also VEGFR-1 agonists rescued survival and
repopulation of VEGF-deﬁcient HSCs, revealing a function for
VEGFR-1 signalling during haematopoiesis.
Differentiation, maintenance and expansion of HSCs is part of a
highly orchestrated process involving multiple growth factors,
cytokines and chemokines, which act in complex circuits of para-
crine and autocrine regulation. Stromal cells such as ﬁbroblasts,
macrophages, T lymphocytes and endothelial cells residing in the
bone marrow secrete a range of cytokines regulating the mainten-
ance of HSCs as well as their rapid expansion during pathologic
conditions. The apparent physical association of HSCs with stromal
cells at sites of HSC maintenance and differentiation suggested
paracrine and juxtacrine (membrane-anchored) mechanisms.
However, various growth factors and cytokines including interleu-
kin (IL)-3, granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(GM-CSF), IL-6 and VEGF are co-expressed with their respective
receptors on normal, early and differentiated haematopoietic cells,
suggesting that autocrine mechanisms are involved in the regulation
of haematopoiesis (for review see ref. 3).
VEGF is expressed in bone marrow, and VEGF levels in HSCs
increase in response to cytokine stimulation4. VEGFR-2 is present
