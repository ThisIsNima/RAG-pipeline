Emiliania huxleyi endures N-limitation with an
efficient metabolic budgeting and effective
ATP synthesis
Sebastian D Rokitta1*, Peter Von Dassow2,3,4, Björn Rost1 and Uwe John1
Abstract
Background: Global change will affect patterns of nutrient upwelling in marine environments, potentially
becoming even stricter regulators of phytoplankton primary productivity. To better understand phytoplankton
nutrient utilization on the subcellular basis, we assessed the transcriptomic responses of the life-cycle stages of the
biogeochemically important microalgae Emiliania huxleyi to nitrogen-limitation. Cells grown in batch cultures were
harvested at ‘early’ and ‘full’ nitrogen-limitation and were compared with non-limited cells. We applied
microarray-based transcriptome profilings, covering ~10.000 known E. huxleyi gene models, and screened
for expression patterns that indicate the subcellular responses.
Results: The diploid life-cycle stage scavenges nitrogen from external organic sources and -like diatoms- uses
the ornithine-urea cycle to rapidly turn over cellular nitrogen. The haploid stage reacts similarly, although nitrogen
scavenging is less pronounced and lipid oxidation is more prominent. Generally, polyamines and proline appear to
constitute major organic pools that back up cellular nitrogen. Both stages induce a malate:quinone-oxidoreductase
that efficiently feeds electrons into the respiratory chain and drives ATP generation with reduced respiratory carbon
throughput.
Conclusions: The use of the ornithine-urea cycle to budget the cellular nitrogen in situations of limitation resembles
the responses observed earlier in diatoms. This suggests that underlying biochemical mechanisms are conserved
among distant clades of marine phototrophic protists. The ornithine-urea cycle and proline oxidation appear to
constitute a sensory-regulatory system that monitors and controls cellular nitrogen budgets under limitation. The
similarity between the responses of the life-cycle stages, despite the usage of different genes, also indicates a strong
functional consistency in the responses to nitrogen-limitation that appears to be owed to biochemical requirements.
The malate:quinone-oxidoreductase is a genomic feature that appears to be absent from diatom genomes, and it is
likely to strongly contribute to the uniquely high endurance of E. huxleyi under nutrient limitation.

Background
Phytoplankton is responsible for about 50% of the global
primary production, driving the global carbon cycle and
sustaining the oceans’ ecosystems [1]. The majority of
the open-ocean areas are generally limited in the macro-
nutrients N and P, and primary production is sporadically
fuelled by eddy-mediated upwelling of remineralized
nutrients [2]. Scenarios of global change predict a warm-
ing of the sea-surface and concomitantly a stronger strati-
fication of water masses. Open-ocean upwelling events
could thereby decrease in frequency and intensity, lowering
nutrient supply to surface waters and ultimately productiv-
ity [3]. In coastal areas, in contrast, intensified eastern
boundary current upwelling and anthropogenic eutrophi-
cation are predicted to increase nutrient levels, enhancing
growth of microalgae [4,5]. Thus, changing nutrient re-
gimes may become even stronger regulators of primary

productivity and potentially alter the ecological and bio-
geochemical functions of these marine habitats.
Coccolithophores belong to the phylum Haptophyta,
evolutionarily deep-branching photosynthetic eukaryotes
that arose from a secondary endosymbiosis and are dis-
tinct from the red/green and brown lineages with respect
to their phylogeny, physiology and cell architecture [6,7].
The numerically most abundant coccolithophore in the
modern ocean, Emiliania huxleyi, is a common constituent
of phytoplankton assemblages from tropical to sub-polar
oceans and is able to form large monospecific blooms up to
the polar fronts [8]. These calcifying phytoplankton not
only fix carbon into biomass but also into calcite and there-
fore contribute significantly to the organic as well as the
inorganic marine carbon pumps. Emiliania is thus an im-
portant regulator of the relative vertical fluxes, which influ-
ence the CO2 uptake capacity of the oceans [9]. The global
existence of diverse strains or ‘ecotypes’ of this species has
led to the recognition of a ‘species-complex’, i.e., a large
group of organisms, which share common ‘core’ parts of
their genomes but possess individual genetic material that
reflects their ecological niche differentiation [7,10].
The ability to tolerate enduring limitation in macro-
nutrients N and P seems to enable certain members of
this species-complex to thrive in oligotrophic environ-
ments [7,11]. The responses of E. huxleyi especially to
N-limitation have been subject to numerous studies,
typically showing that under N-limitation, growth rate
ceases and the calcite to organic carbon ratio increases
[12], photosynthetic performance declines [11] and that
photosynthate exudation can dominate over biomass
production [13,14]. However, underlying physiological
mechanisms of phytoplankton responses to macronutri-
ent limitation remain largely unknown.
E. huxleyi furthermore exhibits a haplo-diplontic life-
cycle: the diploid, calcifying cells can undergo meiosis and
generate haploid cells [15,16]. These non-calcified, motile
haplonts can disperse and propagate independently until
eventually -it is assumed- two individuals undergo syn-
gamy and create a new, diploid cell. Because only the dip-
loid stage is susceptible to lytic viruses, this life-cycling is
thought to function as an important ecological escape
strategy [17]. Indeed, laboratory studies have suggested
that the stages exhibit pronounced physiological and tran-
scriptomic differences, assumed to reflect the natural his-
tory of this species with ecological niche differentiation
also between life-cycle stages [16,18,19].
We hypothesized that the haploid and diploid phases
would show marked differences in their ability to resist N-
limitation, as suggested by their distinct morphology and
gene usage. Also, we hypothesized that the genes most
prominently up-regulated in response to N-limitation are
shared between life phases, reflecting more general bio-
chemical requirements under nutrient stress.
Here, we report the cellular responses to N-limitation on
the basis of macroscopic phenomenology and physiology
(growth, elemental quotas, photosynthetic viability) as well
as the underlying molecular processes (gene expression) in
diploid and haploid life-cycle stages of E. huxleyi. These re-
sults can enable us to generalize and parameterize cellular
functioning of protists under contrasting environmental
conditions, a prerequisite not only for unravelling the gen-
omic repertoire of this organism but also for a successful
integration of this key phytoplankton group in models of
global carbon cycling [20,21].
Results and discussion
Growth characteristics and fluorometry
In the course of the experiment (Figure 1a), growth rates
of diploid and haploid cells started in the range of 0.8 -
1.0 d−1 when nutrients were replete, but declined rapidly
with the beginning of N-limitation at days 6 and 7 and
approached zero around day 12 (Figure 1b). Nutrient
analyses show that in the limited cultures, nitrate and ni-
trite (NO3
−, NO2
−) were fully depleted already at days 6
and 7 (Figure 1c), but phosphate (PO4
3−) concentration
was well above limiting levels (Figure 1d; [22]), proving
that limitation in N, not P, caused the growth arrest.
To monitor carbon chemistry over the course of the
experimental bloom, medium samples were analyzed
for total alkalinity (TA) and dissolved inorganic carbon
(DIC; Figure 1e,f). In the diploid E. huxleyi cultures, TA
decreased over the course of the experiment due to
calcification. The concomitant drop in DIC, despite re-
equilibration with ambient air, is attributed to the
decrease in TA because this parameter determines the
capacity of DIC uptake [23]. In the non-calcifying haploid
cultures, TA was slightly elevated due to the consumption
of NO3
−[23]. Consequently, continuous aeration led to
slight increases also in DIC towards the end of the experi-
ment. TA and DIC were used to calculate [CO2] and pH
(Additional file 1: Figure S1a,b), proving that over the
course of the experiment, [CO2] was always >20 μmol kg−1,
i.e., more than sufficiently high so that co-limitation of N
and C can be ruled out. Also the calculated pH ranged
within a band of 7.85 ± 0.15 over the whole experiment in-
dicating that DIC was successfully replenished in the cul-
tures selected for evaluating the effects of N-limitation.
Hence, it can be stated that DIC and particularly CO2, were
not limiting over the course of the experiment and that the
observed phenomena stem from N-limitation rather than
from carbon limitation.
In consequence, the typical responses to N depletion [8]
were seen from the cellular elemental quotas (Additional
file 2: Figure S2a-e), i.e., an increase in particulate organic
carbon (POC) content, decreases in cellular particular or-
ganic nitrogen (PON) content and drastically elevated
POC:PON ratios when cells experienced N-limitation.

Although the content in particulate inorganic carbon (PIC)
was low due to the generally low pH [24], slight increases in
cellular PIC content under N-limitation in the diploid stage
were visible. This phenomenon is usually attributed to the
reduction of biomass buildup due to limitation being stron-
ger than the simultaneous reduction in PIC production [8].
Fluorescence data showed that diploid E. huxleyi were
viable in the exponential growth phase of the experiment
(Fv/Fm = ~0.5) and maintained photosystem functionality
under N-limitation with only insignificant decreases in
Fv/Fm until the end of the experiment at day 12 (Figure 2).
In the haploid life-cycle stage, in contrast, Fv/Fm values
dropped significantly after day 7, i.e., the onset of limitation,
by up to 36% at day 11 (two-way ANOVA, followed by
Holm-Sidak post-hoc test, P < 0.001; Figure 2). We caution
that Fv/Fm represents the maximal efficiency of PSII after
dark adaptation. No statements can be derived about
actual in-situ photosynthetic rates. Our data confirm
the exceptional ability of diploid E. huxleyi to maintain
functional photosynthetic electron transfer chains under
N-limitation [11] and clearly demonstrate that the haplont
lacks this capability.

Transcriptomic response
Mining the obtained microarray data revealed that distinct
but functionally consistent sets of genes responded in hap-
loid and diploid cells (Figure 3; Additional file 3: Figure S3;
Additional file 4: Spreadsheet S4): Of all the ~28700
transcripts screened towards their reaction to N-limitation,
4496 genes (55% of all significantly regulated genes) chan-
ged expression only in the diploid stage. 2376 genes
(29% of all significantly regulated genes) were differen-
tially expressed only in the haploid stage. Only 1136
genes (14% of all significantly regulated genes) experi-
enced unidirectional expression changes in both life
cycle stages under full N-limitation. A residual of 114
genes (1% of the significantly regulated genes) showed
a counter-regulation between stages. These results are
consistent with a tripartite genome, where significant
portions of genes show highly stage-specific expression
patterns, as seen previously under replete growth con-
ditions [16,19].
The comparison of the two assessed time points ‘early
limitation’ and ‘full limitation’ revealed that these two
datasets are very coherent: ~60-70% of the genes of the
‘full’ response are already responding in the ‘early’ stage of
limitation (Figure 3; Additional file 4: Spreadsheet S4).
Those are indeed the most striking indicators for the cel-
lular rearrangements reported in this study. This suggests
that the cellular ‘first response’ to N-limitation is a rapid
and comprehensive restructuring of the basic metabolism
that occurs in an ‘all-or-nothing’ manner. At the later time
point, we observed strong amplification of this ‘first re-
sponse’ expression patterns, indicating that the triggered
cellular program is gradually intensified with the time, or
with the degree of starvation.

distribution, i.e. the frequency of observed expression ratios. In horizontal direction, the heat map depicts the time course of N-limitation in haploid
and diploid individuals. In vertical direction, clusters of transcripts reflect the usage of genes, i.e. stage-specific, unidirectional, counter-regulated.

Under ‘full limitation’, we furthermore observed add-
itional regulation of genetic machinery. It may be sus-
pected that these genes are expressed due to the ongoing
nutrient stress. However, the large number of ‘unknowns’
does not allow further statements on their specific func-
tion. Although we report the data for both time points in
the supporting information spreadsheets we will, for sim-
plicity, focus on the data of the ‘full limitation’ response as
here the observed transcriptomic responses are more
clearly depicted. To maintain scope and clarity, the tran-
scriptomic responses to N-limitation of each stage are
elaborated separately, beginning with the diploid calcifying
stage. The exemplary transcript clusters that are explicitly
mentioned in the text are collected in Additional file 5:
Spreadsheet S5.
Diploid stage
Deactivation of protein biosynthesis
In the diploid stage, N-limitation caused significant up-
and down-regulation of 2447 and 3307 transcript clus-
ters. The dataset indicates a global decrease of cellular
activity: Biosynthesis appeared de-activated at the levels
of transcription and translation, as numerous features
indicate down-regulation of RNA polymerases (RNA
polymerase I subunits GJ20109, GJ07166, GJ20108; RNA
polymerase II subunits GJ02734, GJ00400, GJ23980,
GJ22750; RNA polymerase III subunit GJ01405) as well
as ribosomes in the cytoplasm (40S ribosomal proteins
GJ21301, GJ07497, GJ16295; 60S ribosomal proteins
GJ03947, GJ23720, GJ08989) and the organelles (Mitochon-
drial/chloroplast ribosomal proteins GJ21760, GJ18064,
GJ08340, GJ16340).
Likewise, most tRNA synthetases were concertedly
down-regulated, indicating that cells decreased de-novo
protein-synthesis. In line with this, we further observed
strong down-regulation of machinery involved in the
de-novo syntheses of amino acids (e.g., Asparagine syn-
thase GJ02807, Aspartate kinase GJ09398), purines and
pyrimidines (AICAR-transformylase/IMP cyclohydro-
lase GJ07918; Glycinamide ribonucleotide synthetase/
Aminoimidazole ribonucleotide synthetase GJ13295;
Adenylosuccinat-Lyase GJ10021, GJ05238; Dihydroor-
otase GJ11657, GJ20229; Glutamine phosphoribosyl-
pyrophosphate amidotransferase GJ02409; Phosphori-
bosylformylglycinamidine synthase GJ05919, GJ00085).
These expression patterns strongly suggest that the
overall biosynthetic activity is to a considerable extent
regulated at the transcript level and is strongly reduced
in response to N-limitation.
Deactivation of the light reactions
The dataset indicated a strong down-regulation of nu-
merous critical components of the photosystems (e.g.,
PS I reaction center subunit IV GJ17955; PS II 12 kDa
extrinsic protein GJ10857; PSII reaction center GJ09667;
PS II oxygen-evolving enhancer protein GJ19198) and the
light-harvesting antennae (e.g., fucoxanthin-chlorophyll a-
c binding protein GJ02563: chloroplast light harvesting
protein isoform 2 GJ23738) as was previously observed
under nutrient limitation [25]. Also, elements of the xan-
thophyll cycle (zeaxanthin epoxidase GJ10268, GJ00453,
GJ22205; violaxanthin deepoxidase GJ02541, GJ07458),
and plastidic ATP synthesis (GJ15617, GJ19940) were
prominently down-regulated, indicating that the photo-
synthetic light reactions were strongly decreased. Cells
down-regulated the expression of crucial enzymes of
chlorophyll synthesis e.g., glutamate-semialdehyde amino-
mutase (GJ01010), and Mg-chelatase (GJ00007, GJ01253),
and thus use ancient regulatory switches that are well con-
served even in land plants [26]. Despite this overall down-
regulation of light-harvesting capacity, cells prominently
induced fucoxanthin-chlorophyll a-c binding proteins of
the LI818-group (GJ26033, GJ04295, GJ16863) under full
N-limitation. These proteins have been shown to be
expressed under high light conditions and are believed to
function in the mitigation of photo-oxidative stress [27].
Their prominent expression supports the notion that cells
make attempts to reduce overall light harvesting and re-
ductant input under N-limitation. Apparently this strategy
is successful, as the residual photosystems showed no
signs of extensive light stress or compromised electron
flow, as Fv/Fm values remained high (Figure 2).
The down-regulation of several plastidic triose and hex-
ose translocators (GJ03350, GJ07072, GJ01768) indicated
decreased transport processes between the plastid and
cytosol. Apparently, this large-scale plastid-inactivation
not only minimizes carbon and reductant input into the
cell, but also requires the reallocation of plastid-based bio-
chemical tasks, like N-assimilation, to the cytosol, leading
to an overall metabolic isolation of the chloroplast. In this
metabolic low-throughput mode, however, cellular N must
be efficiently recycled intracellularly.
Reconstellation of nitrogen metabolism
Under N-limitation, the diploid cells increased expression
of NH4
+ transporters and multiple enzymes that scavenge
N from various external organic sources, e.g., azoreductase
(GJ05276, GJ06383), nitropropane dioxygenase (GJ07219)
or carbon-nitrogen-hydrolase (GJ13749). The ability to
use external NH4
+ and organic nitrogenous compounds
has been demonstrated earlier and is thought to contrib-
ute to E. huxleyi’s broad ecological range [28]. Plastidic ni-
trite (NO2
−) reductase (GJ07852) was down-regulated,
probably due to inactivation of this organelle. No regula-
tion was measured for NO3
−reductase, although enzyme
activity has been shown earlier to cease in E. huxleyi under
N-limitation [29]. In addition to external scavenging, the
cells induced mitochondrial amino acid oxidation, i.e.,

catabolic reactions that efficiently cleave NH4
+ from the
cellular amino acids (aspartate aminotransferase/glutamate-
oxaloacetate transaminase GJ19978; NADH-dependent glu-
tamate dehydrogenase GJ00044). The data strongly suggest
that the process of amino acid oxidation is biochemically
succeeded by an ornithine-urea cycle (OUC; Figure 4). This
cycle was long thought to facilitate clearance of N in meta-
zoans, but was recently shown to play an important role as
a hub for N-redistribution also in diatoms and other photo-
synthetic protists [30-33]. Diploid, N-limited E. huxleyi
down-regulated most genes of the OUC (carbamoylpho-
sphate synthetase GJ00207, GJ00711, GJ10276, GJ11368;
ornithine transcarbamoylase GJ02569; argininosuccinate
lyase 1 GJ04986, GJ10215; Arginase, GJ14778), which clo-
sely resembles the responses of diatoms to N-limitation
[30,31]. Furthermore, genes that connect the OUC with
proline- and polyamine synthetic pathways were also found
down-regulated (ornithine aminotransferase GJ10009; orni-
thine decarboxylase GJ00974, GJ11436; spermine/spermi-
dine synthase GJ05786, GJ16513). This down-regulation of
the OUC and the branching polyamine-synthesis indicates
that overall metabolite flux is decreased. However, de-
creased enzyme activity could also lead to increased pool
sizes of the connected metabolites, and especially with in-
creased NH4
+ input, it might be that a relatively higher frac-
tion of cellular N is reallocated to these compounds. Such a
mechanism could establish biochemical sinks that retain
N from the rest of the metabolism and function as sav-
ing deposits, which are less readily accessible than
amino acid pools. The osmoprotective functions of poly-
amines are coincidently beneficial and closely associated
to various cellular stress responses in many phototrophs
[30,34-37]. Certainly, the dynamics of polyamine pools
should be subject of further interrogations using metabo-
lomic techniques.
The
prominent
up-regulation
of
proline
oxidase
(GJ05200), which feeds reduction equivalents into the elec-
tron transfer chain (ETC; Figure 4), suggests that proline
oxidation may be a considerable contributor of ATP syn-
thesis under N-limitation. Moreover, it may be hypothe-
sized that proline oxidation at the same time serves as a
redox-sensor: Proline is a side-metabolite of polyamine
metabolism [35,36]. Its concentration and thus reductant
input into the ETC should -depending on metabolic
constellations- be somewhat proportional to the metabolite
load of the polyamine pools, and reflect approximately the
availability of cellular N. Such a concentration-dependent
mechanism may indeed be responsible for the amplifica-
tion of expression patterns observed between the sampled
time points (Figure 3). In this way, the OUC and the pro-
line cycle could constitute a metabolic sensor for cellular
N budgets, as similarly suspected for higher plants and
metazoans [38,39]. Interestingly, the proline oxidase is
more known for its role as a highly conserved tumor
suppressor that causes cell cycle arrest in the G2 phase and
regulates apoptosis, both in plants and metazoan cells
[36,38-41]. Its prominent induction in N-limited, cell-cycle
arrested E. huxleyi highlights that the molecular decisions,
balancing growth versus cell cycle arrest or apoptosis in re-
sponse to macronutrient status, appear widely and highly
conserved across eukaryote lineages.
To release N from the polyamine stores, cells appear to
make use of amine oxidases (GJ15345, GJ19732) and pyr-
roline dehydrogenase (GJ01187). To mobilize N via the
OUC, cells induced a distinct argininosuccinate-lyase 2
(GJ01289) and urease (GJ22989) that appear to support
the withdrawal of urea and ultimately NH4
+ from the
cycle. The NH4
+ released to the cytoplasm appears to be
salvaged by a cytosolic glutamine synthetase (GJ01535,
GJ28143; [42]), which catalyzes the ATP-driven amination
of glutamate and is known to be especially induced under
N-limitation (Figure 4; [43]). Thus, cells appeared to re-
place the plastid-based N assimilation via the GS/GOGAT
system [44] by a cytoplasmic NH4
+ assimilation. Such a
mechanism could profit from a higher relative ATP avail-
ability when protein translation is shut down.
Carbon fluxes
The reconfigurations of the N metabolism were paralleled
by a re-structuring of mitochondrial carbon fluxes. The
mitochondrial aspartate/glutamate translocator (GJ05042)
was up-regulated, suggesting increased export of oxaloace-
tate from the mitochondria in exchange for amino acids
destined for oxidation. Conventionally, oxaloacetate is re-
duced to malate in the cytoplasm, and the malate is then
shuttled back into the mitochondria, a mechanism known
as the malate-aspartate-shuttle, which conveys reduction
equivalents to the mitochondrial matrix. However, the
counterpart to complete the shuttle, the oxoglutarate/mal-
ate carrier (GJ07712) was found down-regulated under N-
limitation, an expression pattern observed previously in
N-limited E. huxleyi [45]. To still complete the shuttle
mechanism, cells induce tricarboxylate carriers (GJ03542,
GJ25096) that facilitate the malate import but simultan-
eously export citrate from the mitochondria, ultimately
delivering acetyl-CoA to the cytoplasm.
Such increased export of acetyl-CoA from the mito-
chondria supplies substrates for the buildup of lipids,
and indeed, up-regulation of a β-ketoacyl-ACP reduc-
tase (GJ04287), and ‘very long-chain fatty acid con-
densing enzyme 17’ (GJ03551, GJ00296) were observed.
Likewise, acyl-CoA synthetase (GJ00540), that commits
fatty acids for oxidation, was down-regulated, which
also should increase the relative lipid content of cells.
However, a cohort of enzymes involved in fatty acid syn-
thesis
was
concertedly
down-regulated
(acetyl-CoA
carboxylase
GJ16107;
3-oxoacyl-(acyl-carrier-protein)
synthase GJ04276; enoyl-CoA dehydratase, GJ04137;

long chain fatty acid elongase GJ11770). These rear-
rangements in fatty acid metabolism indicate an alter-
ation of types and sites of lipid synthesis due to changed
lipid demands and explain the often observed massive lipo-
genesis under N-limitation in E. huxleyi (Figure 4; [46,47]).
The induction of lipogenesis in N-limited diatoms likely fol-
lows similar mechanisms and cell-biological constraints, e.g.
requirement for transient sinks for C and reductant [48].
The plastid localized, but nuclear encoded genes of the
shikimate pathway, which generates aromatic com-
pounds, were down-regulated (DAHP synthase GJ04247;
shikimate kinase GJ05792; chorismate synthase GJ13562,
GJ05023). Aromatics are crucial precursors of quinones
and down-regulation of this pathway likely feeds forward
on the carrying capacity of the ETC, which, indeed, greatly
rearranged under N-limitation.
Electron fluxes
The glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle that conveys cytoplas-
mic NADH directly into the ETC was found down-
regulated (GJ21847, GJ01847, GJ21846), which might be
also related to the decreased needs for glycerol-based
membranelipids. Consequently, relatively more NADH
is available and the reduction of oxaloacetate to malate
in the context of the discussed mitochondrial shuttling
likely becomes the prime catabolic sink for cytoplasmic
reductant. Enzyme complexes of the respiratory chain
were prominently down-regulated (e.g. NADH:ubiquin-
one oxidoreductase GJ12786, GJ14395; cytochrome com-
plex GJ03828, GJ16747; Subunits of FOF1 ATP synthase,
GJ00632, GJ05568), indicating that the conventional elec-
tron input of NADH into the ETC via Complex I as well as
ATP synthesis in general were decreased. To compensate
this, E. huxleyi induced a mitochondrial malate:quinone oxi-
doreductase (MQO, GJ00410; Figure 4). This enzyme has
been characterized mainly in prokaryotes but has recently
been recognized in a number of other alveolate protists [49]
and appears to be absent from diatom genomes (Thalassio-
sira pseudonana, Phaeodactylum tricornutum, Fragilar-
iopsis cylindrus; http://genome.jgi-psf.org/). MQO transfers
electrons directly from malate to the quinone pool of the
ETC
[50]
and
thereby
bypasses
the
conventional
malate-dehydrogenase (MDH) of the TCA-cycle. This
appears to be of strong advantage because the latter re-
action has a very unfavorable standard free energy dif-
ference (ΔG°’ = 28.5 kJ mol−1): It will only take place
when the TCA cycle is simultaneously removing oxaloace-
tate, i.e., burning carbon. In contrast, the MQO-catalyzed
oxidation of malate with ubiquinone has a very favorable
standard free energy difference (ΔG°’ = −55 kJ mol−1),
allowing the organism to efficiently oxidize malate even
under circumstances where a conventional MDH is unable
to do so, e.g., when ratios of mitochondrial [oxaloacetate]/
[malate] or [NADH]/[NAD] are high (e.g., [51]). Appar-
ently, the observed cumulated activity of lipid turnover and
MQO feeds [e−] into the ETC, reducing respiratory carbon
loss (Figure 4). These metabolic rearrangements are likely
to support efficient ATP synthesis under adverse environ-
mental constellations, e.g., nutrient limitation.
Haploid stage
In the haploid life-cycle stage of E. huxleyi, N-limitation
showed significant up- and down-regulation of 1457 and
2174 features, respectively, and those responses were func-
tionally nearly congruent with the diploid stage.
Deactivation of protein biosynthesis
A general down-regulation of biosynthesis occurred at the
level of RNA transcription and protein translation in all cel-
lular compartments, similar to the diplont. However, overall
fewer features in the haplont than in the diplont indicated
down-regulation of transcriptional machinery (RNA Poly-
merase II, second largest subunit GJ10007), ribosomal com-
ponents (Ribsomal protein L21 GJ22830) and diverse
tRNA synthetases. These less pronounced regulation
patterns with respect to transcription and translation
are consistent with the previous suggestion that the
haploid stage administrates its proteome more on post-
translational bases rather than through transcriptional
and translational regulation [19].
(See figure on previous page.)
Figure 4 Proposed generalized metabolic constellations in Emiliania huxleyi under N-replete and N-limited conditions: Under N-replete
conditions (top), photosynthetic light reactions produce ATP and NADPH, which are consumed in the photosynthetic Calvin cycle.
After export from the plastid, the produced carbohydrates are submitted to glycolysis to produce pyruvate (Pyr), which is transported to mitochondria
and burned in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA-) cycle. The NADH created in cytoplasm and mitochondrion is fed into the quinone-pool (Q) of the mitochondrial
respiratory chain. Lipogenesis that relies on the shuttling of citrate and malate as well as NADPH production by the pentose-phosphate pathway (PPP)
works normally. Plastidary N-assimilation via the GS-GOGAT cycle provides amino acids for protein synthesis. Under N-limited conditions (bottom),
photosynthesis, i.e., carbon and energy input is minimized, so that the flux through glycolysis and the TCA cycle is reduced. Cells strongly induce the
citrate-shuttle that exports acetyl-CoA into the cytoplasm and increase the relative intensity of lipid turnover (synthesis and oxidation), which provides
required sinks for excess reduction equivalents. To facilitate electron input into Q under these adverse flux conditions, cells make use of a malate:quinone
oxidoreductase (MQO). Mitochondrial amino acid oxidation is increased, while enzymes of the ornithine-urea-cycle (OUC) and connected reactions are
throttled, putatively leading to accumulation of OUC intermediates as well as polyamines and proline. The oxidation of proline to pyrroline-5-carboxylate
(P5C) by proline oxidase (ProO) also appears to be a major entryway for reductants into Q when N is scarce, and a gateway to feed stored N into the
metabolism. Especially the diploid stage induces machinery to scavenge external (in)organic nitrogenous compounds (blue shade).

Deactivation of plastids
Data indicated a down-regulation of photosynthetic light
reactions, involving mostly the genetic machinery that was
observed in the diploid stage, e.g., photosystem compo-
nents (PS II reaction center protein GJ09667), light har-
vesting antennae (light harvesting proteins, GJ19276,
GJ18462), enzymes of the xanthophyll cycle (zeaxanthin
epoxidase GJ 22205, GJ00453, GJ05220, violaxanthin dee-
poxidase GJ02541, GJ07458), as well as chlorophyll synthe-
sis (Protochlorophyllid reductase GJ01226, Mg-chelatase
(GJ00007). Also, the decreased expression levels of plasti-
dic translocators for glucose-6-phosphate/phosphate and
phosphoenolpyruvate/phosphate (GJ03350, GJ07072, GJ0
1768) support the notion that, like in the diploid life-cycle
stage, plastid activity was reduced and consequently, meta-
bolic flux between plastid and cytoplasm was decreased
under N-limitation.
Reconstellation of nitrogen metabolism
The effects of N-limitation on the haploid metabolism
shared common features with the diplont response, e.g.,
the down-regulation of the synthesis of key amino acids,
purines and pyrimidines. The OUC was, like in the dip-
loid stage, down-regulated in key reactions (carbamoylpho-
sphate synthase GJ11368, GJ00711; ornithine transporter
GJ27211; argininosuccinate synthase GJ01516) and also in
peripheral reactions that divert intermediates towards pro-
line or polyamine synthesis (ornithine aminotransferase
GJ00647; ornithine decarboxylase GJ06908). These regula-
tion patterns indicate that the haploid stage applies the
same biochemical strategy of using OUC cycle intermedi-
ates and their derivatives as a cellular backup for N.
Clearly visible in the haploid stage was the down-
regulation of the plastidary GS-GOGAT system, which con-
ventionally assimilates inorganic N (glutamine-synthetase
GJ00014, GJ09184, GJ12379; glutamate-synthase GJ12602),
as well as the machinery for assimilation of oxidized inor-
ganic nitrogen sources (NO2
−transporter GJ07216; NO3
−
transporter GJ16902, GJ15318, GJ00825; NO2
−reductase
GJ21771, GJ00725; NO3
−reductase GJ04471, GJ23958,
GJ09099). The down-regulation of NO3
−reductase under
N-limitation has been observed earlier in diploid E. huxleyi
cultures [29,52] and in N-limited diatoms [31], and has
been attributed to a substrate-sensing regulatory system
that enables transcription of NO3
−related genes only in the
presence of NO3
−[53]. Unlike the diplont, the haploid stage
did not induce an ATP-driven cytoplasmic glutamate ami-
nation to salvage NH4
+ liberated from internal amino acid
turnover. Likewise, no expression changes in the machinery
for the uptake of dissolved (in)organic N was seen in the
haplont. One explanation may be that salvaging of dissolved
(in)organic nitrogenous compounds may be constitutively
expressed in the haploid stage, so that no expression
changes could be seen.
Carbon fluxes
In the haploid response to N-limitation, enzymes of fatty
acid synthesis were concertedly down-regulated (acetyl-
CoA carboxylase GJ00002, GJ00064; malonyl -ACP
transacylase
GJ05975,
GJ03112;
3-oxoacyl-ACP-syn-
thase I and II GJ01429; polyunsaturated fatty acid spe-
cific
elongases
GJ04003,
GJ11347),
while
enzymes
involved in lipid oxidation were up-regulated (acyl-CoA
dehydrogenase GJ07324; hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydroge-
nase GJ00214, GJ00215,GJ03356). This clearly suggests
a prioritization of lipid oxidation, i.e., a provision of C
in form of acetyl-CoA. In line with this was the up-
regulation of the carnitine shuttle, which imports fatty
acids to the mitochondrial site of oxidation (L-carnitine
dehydratase GJ20083; carnitine/acylcarnitine translocator
GJ11395) and the classical marker enzymes isocitrate lyase
(GJ00349) and malate synthase (GJ00164). These enzymes
skip parts of the TCA cycle and instead reroute carbon
into a glyoxylate cycle, so that acetyl-CoA derived from
fatty acid oxidation is used to produce succinate and mal-
ate. This bypass feeds formerly immobilized carbon back
into the primary metabolism. The down-regulation of the
mitochondrial tricarboxylate carrier (GJ03542) was oppo-
site to that of the diploid stage, suggesting that in the hap-
loid stage, different gene sets for lipogenesis and lipolysis
operate that are more strictly counter-regulated, whereas in
the diplont these systems can run to a large extent simul-
taneously. However, under N-limitation the haploid stage
induced Na+/dicarboxylate carriers (GJ11524, GJ06704)
and also a malate/oxaloacetate translocator (GJ27728).
Thus, the haplont uses different transporters, but the
resulting transporter constellation may however be well
able to facilitate traffic of metabolites similar to the diploid
stage. It appears that the abundance and relative activity of
different mitochondrial shuttle systems critically determines
the direction of flow of C and [e−], and in consequence also
N. These regulation patterns are in line with previous tran-
scriptomic data suggesting that intense fatty acid turnover
is a special property of the haploid life-cycle stage of E. hux-
leyi [19,54].
Electron fluxes
Data suggests that, like in diploid cells, the decreased
photosynthetic input of C and reductants is paralleled
by the same adjustments of mitochondrial connectivity and
electron sinks: The down-regulation of the glycerol-3-
phosphate
shuttle
(GJ01847,
GJ07067,
GJ02661),
the
NADH:ubiquinone
oxidoreductase
(GJ12786,
GJ05219,
GJ00231), the cytochrome complex (GJ03931, GJ25391,
GJ22387) and multiple subunits of FOF1 ATP synthase
(GJ26307, GJ05568, GJ00632) indicated that under N-
limitation, conventional ATP generation was decreased and
cellular energy budgets were considerably reduced. Succi-
nate dehydrogenase, however, was up-regulated (GJ00350,
Rokitta et al. BMC Genomics 2014, 15:1051

----- Page 10 (native) -----
GJ27868, GJ05263), possibly due to increased activity of the
glyoxylate cycle, of which succinate is a direct product. Also
in the haplont, proline oxidase (GJ05200) was prominently
up-regulated, supporting the notion that OUC and proline
oxidation constitute an important sensing mechanisms
that is a crucial element in the cellular N-budgeting.
Also, like cells of the diploid life-cycle stage, the haplont
induced mitochondrial MQO to maintain electron flux
through the respiratory chain even under adverse envi-
ronmental conditions.
Ecophysiological significance of nitrogen-limitation
responses
The obtained transcriptomic data well support the flux
modes of N through protistan metabolism as they were
previously hypothesized by [30] and [31]. Also in E. hux-
leyi, the OUC appears to be a distributional hub for N
that balances carbon assimilation and breakdown with
available cellular nitrogen budgets. This balancing may
be achieved because N and C metabolism rely on and
respond to common substrates [31,32,55]. The presence
of OUC genes also in dinoflagellates [33] suggests that
the described metabolic responses satisfy biochemical re-
quirements which are generally imposed on eukaryotic
cells in nutrient-scarce environments. Here we show the
first evidence that E. huxleyi applies an MQO, an inter-
esting genetic feature among eukaryotic phytoplankton,
which seems to enable organisms to drive efficient ATP
synthesis with reduced respiratory carbon loss. This en-
zyme might contribute to E. huxleyi’s ability to inhabit
very divergent environments [7,8,56]. The profound
regulation patterns we observed in response to N limi-
tation are not recognizable in the response to sulfate de-
ficiency as presented by Bochenek et al. [57]. Under
sulfate deprivation, cell division was slowed down, but
growth in terms of biomass production was still high, as
can be derived from the strongly increased cell volumes.
This may be the reason why under sulfate deficiency
there was no indication of a comparable large-scale
metabolic re-configurations as seen under N-limitation.
The haploid cells, which might function as a ‘seeding
population’ in the aftermath of viral bloom termination
[17], showed less transcriptomic responses globally,
which paralleled the lower increase in particulate C:N
ratio under N-limitation in haploid compared to diploid
cells (Additional file 2: Figure S2). Haploid cells apparently
did not specifically regulate genes for scavenging external
N sources when confronted with N-limitation. This may
either be due to a constitutive expression of N scavenging
machinery or perhaps because the haplont does not rely
on these genes at all, being more adapted for ‘post-bloom’
environments, in which waters may contain higher
amounts of organic nutrients released from decaying
phytoplankton. As both life-cycle stages appear to have
mixotrophic capacities [19], in the hypothesized natural
scenario, haplonts might generally be able to rely more on
external dissolved or particulate sources of N. These diver-
ging morphological and physiological properties support
the notion that the stages are specialized to occupy dis-
tinct ecological niches.
Conclusions
The two life-cycle stages showed distinct physiological
responses to N-limitation, reflected also in very different
sets of genes responding in both phases and a lower
overall transcriptomic response in the haploid phase
compared to the diploid phase. These results strongly
support the theory that the haploid and diploid life-cycle
stages are evolutionarily shaped for the distinct eco-
logical niches they occupy. Despite strong physiological
differences between the responses of each stage, funda-
mental functional similarities emerged from the data:
Under N-limitation, both life-cycle stages shut down
growth and biosynthetic activity. Cells switch into a
‘low-throughput metabolism’ (Figure 4) in which C fix-
ation and respiration are minimized and cellular N is ef-
ficiently
salvaged.
The
redistribution
of
N
among
internal pools of polyamines and the mobilization via
the OUC resembles metabolic behavior documented in
other protists. This suggests functional commonalities
across distant phylogenetic clades. The OUC and proline
oxidation might play a central role in coordinating and in-
tegrating the cellular fluxes of C, N and reductants in
most, if not all eukaryotes. The deployment of an MQO
that supports ATP synthesis under limitation appears to
be a principal and advantageous component of E. huxleyi’s
cellular energy management. Its enduring photosynthesis,
parsimonious N budgeting and efficient ATP generation
in situations of limitation may be hallmarks of the success
of the E. huxleyi diplont in contemporary oceans.
Methods
Culturing, growth and fluorometry
Diploid and haploid cells of E. huxleyi (Strains RCC
1216 and RCC1217, respectively, both obtained from the
Roscoff Culture Collection) were cultured in 5 L Schott
borosilicate bottles (biological triplication) containing
0.2 μm filtered North Sea seawater medium (salinity 32).
Cultures were grown at 15°C under a light:dark cycle of
16:8 hours under light intensities of 250 ± 25 μmol pho-
tons m−2 s−1 (FQ 54 W/965HO daylight lamps; OSRAM,
Munich, Germany), as measured with a datalogger (LI-
1400; Li-Cor, Lincoln, USA) equipped with a 4π-sensor
(Walz, Effeltrich, Germany). The control medium (N-re-
plete) was enriched with vitamins and trace-metals (F/2
medium; Guillard & Ryther 1962). Nitrate (NO3
−) and
phosphate (PO4
3−) were added in concentrations of 100
and 6.25 μmol kg−1. The ‘N-limited’ medium was

supplemented with vitamins, trace-metals and PO4
3−
only. Prior to the experiment, cells were pre-acclimated
to the experimental settings for 10 days in dilute batch
cultures, maintaining exponential growth. Over the dur-
ation of the experiment (13 days), medium was purged
with humidified air (flow-rate 130 ± 20 mL min−1) to
counteract cell sedimentation and to replenish dissolved
inorganic carbon (DIC). In addition, bottles were manu-
ally moved several times a day to enhance suspension of
cells. The concentrations of haploid and diploid cells, grow-
ing under ‘control’ and ‘N-limited’ conditions, were assayed
on a daily bases using a Multi-Sizer III hemocytometer
(Beckman-Coulter, Fullerton, USA). Specific growth rates
were calculated from daily increments following the equa-
tion μ = (ln(c1)-ln(c0)) Δt−1, where c0 and c1 are the cell
concentrations at two time points and Δt is the time inter-
val. To follow inorganic carbon chemistry, total alkalinity
(TA) was calculated from linear Gran-titration plots [58],
obtained from automated titration of filtered culture
medium (TitroLine alpha plus, Schott, Mainz, Germany).
Concentrations of DIC were measured colorimetrically
[59], using a QUAATRO autoanalyzer (Seal Analytical,
Norderstedt, Germany. CO2 and pH were calculated using
CO2SYS [60] and were based on measurements of DIC,
TA, temperature, salinity and PO4
3−. Dissociation constants
for carbonic acid and sulfuric acid were used from [61] and
[62].
For elemental analyses of particulate organic C and N
(POC, PON), cultures were gently filtered onto pre-
combusted GF/F filters (12 h, 500°C, 1.2 μm pore size;
Whatman). Prior to the determination of POC contents,
respective filters were acidified with 200 μL 0.2 mol L−1
HCl (Merck) to remove any calcite. Analyses were carried
out using an EuroVector CHNS-O elemental analyzer
(EuroEA, Milano, Italy). Cellular PIC quotas were assessed
using the ICP-MS method developed by [63].
To assess photosynthetic viability of the cells, the ratios
of variable:maximal fluorescence (Fv/Fm) were assessed
using
a
fast-induction
relaxation
fluorometer
(FIRe,
Satlantic, Halifax, Canada).
Microarray hybridization
Haploid and diploid cultures were sampled at two time
points that reflect ‘early limitation’ (days 9 and 10 in
haploid and diploid cultures, respectively) and ‘full limi-
tation’ (days 11 and 12 in haploid and diploid cultures,
respectively). As reference points, RNA was sampled
from haploid and diploid cultures grown in control
medium (N-replete) at days 6 and 7, reflecting unlimited
exponential growth in dilute culture. The microarray-
based transcriptome screening followed the protocol from
[24]. In brief, ~1.5*107 cells were harvested and disrupted
in a beadmill. The extracted RNA (Qiagen RNeasy) was
DNAse treated and enriched by ultrafiltration (MicroCon
YM 30 columns, Millipore). Integrity of isolated RNA was
verified using a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Waldbronn,
Germany). RNA Spike-In Mix (Agilent, p/n 5188–5279)
was added to 250 ng RNA of the samples as a benchmark
of hybridization performance prior to cDNA synthesis
and cRNA synthesis/labeling reactions (Two-color low
RNA Input fluorescent linear amplification kit, Agilent,
p/n 5184–3523). 750 ng of each Cy-3 and Cy-5 labeled
cRNA were hybridized onto 2*105 K Emiliania hux-
leyi custom-built microarrays (Agilent, Design# 022065).
Three microarray probes were designed (i.e., on-chip tech-
nical replication) based on 39.091 Sanger EST sequences
obtained from strains RCC1216 and RCC 1217 [16] and
72.513 Sanger EST sequences from CCMP1516 [7] that
were assembled into 28670 transcript clusters using the
whole genome assembly of Emiliania huxleyi CCMP1516
[7] as a reference. This microarray design has been used
in prior studies and probe-sequences and chip layout are
openly accessible from the ArrayExpress database (http://
www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/arrays/A-MEXP-2177).
The
original reference transcript sequences are available as
supporting information in FASTA format (Additional file
6: S6). Hybridization was performed following the Two-
Color Microarray-based Gene Expression Analysis pro-
tocol (Agilent, p/n 5188–5242). Arrays were immediately
scanned after hybridization with a G2505C microarray
scanner (Agilent) using standard photomultiplier tube set-
tings and 5 μm scan resolution. In the microarray hybri-
dizations, every biological replicate was hybridized against
the same common control baseline (i.e., pooled control
RNA from all treatments) to minimize hybridization bia-
ses. Treatment-vs.-treatment expression ratios were then
calculated from the single treatment-vs.-control expres-
sion ratios. All further reported expression ratios are rela-
tive to the control, i.e., unlimited exponential growth in
the N-replete treatment.
Data treatment
Raw data was extracted with Feature Extraction Software
version 9.0 (Agilent). Analysis was performed using
GeneSpring
11
(Agilent).
LOWESS-normalized
data
were submitted to the MIAMExpress database hosted by
the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI; www.ebi.
ac.uk/arrayexpress; accession code E-MTAB-2274). The
hybridization results of the biological triplicates (i.e.,
treatment-vs.-treatment expression ratios) were eva-
luated using multiple comparison tests (ANOVA) fol-
lowed by a Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery-rate
filtering procedure [64] provided in the Genespring 11
software package. Regulation was called significant
when probe-specific corrected p-values were <0.05. The
dataset was then reduced to only those probes, which
detected expression changes in response to the N-
limitation treatment by more than 1.5-fold. When a

divergent regulation was reported, i.e., probes for the
same transcript cluster indicating regulation in opposite
directions, the respective probe set was as a whole
excluded from further analyses (<15 probe sets per
hybridization). In case that only one out of three probes
reported significant differential expression but two
probes reported unaltered expression, the respective
probe sets were as well excluded from further analyses
to further increase the confidence level of results (300–
700 probe sets per hybridization). The remaining probe
sets were then merged, and are in the manuscript re-
ported as significantly regulated features representing
one transcript cluster. For completeness, the number of
hit probes and the average fold-change values and ob-
tained (corrected) p-values are reported for every tran-
script cluster.
Data annotation
Significantly regulated clusters were assigned to an an-
notation table. This table was generated using BLASTn
similarity searches, in which the 28670 transcript clus-
ters were aligned with the ‘Emihu1_best_transcripts’
database provided by the Joint Genome Institute (JGI).
After excluding alignments with an e-value <10-5, the
two best aligning, but different transcript models were
implemented into the annotation table. This allowed the
assignment of ~21740 investigated transcript clusters to
models existing in the JGI E. huxleyi gene catalog.
Assigned JGI model IDs were then aligned with the ‘best
gene-model’ predictions, based on similarity to eukaryotic
orthologous genes (KOG; provided by the JGI). This
KOG-database harbors functional information on ~11930
different E. huxleyi models in the JGI catalog. Additionally,
generic information on the investigated transcript clusters
was obtained by Blast2GO (B2G) queries ([65]; e-value
cutoff at >10-6), and the GO information was augmented
to the annotation. The final transcriptome screening in-
volved ~10.000 E. huxleyi transcripts with a confidently
predicted function. The integrity and validity of gene
models of interest that are discussed in the text were
reconfirmed by model inspection in the JGI draft genome
database and by BLAST searches. In the text, exemplary
transcripts of interest are notated with their numerical
cluster identifiers.
