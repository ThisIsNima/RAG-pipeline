We introduce here a new method for computing differences between microbial communities based on
phylogenetic information. This method, UniFrac, measures the phylogenetic distance between sets of taxa in a
phylogenetic tree as the fraction of the branch length of the tree that leads to descendants from either one
environment or the other, but not both. UniFrac can be used to determine whether communities are signiﬁ-
cantly different, to compare many communities simultaneously using clustering and ordination techniques, and
to measure the relative contributions of different factors, such as chemistry and geography, to similarities
between samples. We demonstrate the utility of UniFrac by applying it to published 16S rRNA gene libraries
from cultured isolates and environmental clones of bacteria in marine sediment, water, and ice. Our results
reveal that (i) cultured isolates from ice, water, and sediment resemble each other and environmental clone
sequences from sea ice, but not environmental clone sequences from sediment and water; (ii) the geographical
location does not correlate strongly with bacterial community differences in ice and sediment from the Arctic
and Antarctic; and (iii) bacterial communities differ between terrestrially impacted seawater (whether polar or
temperate) and warm oligotrophic seawater, whereas those in individual seawater samples are not more
similar to each other than to those in sediment or ice samples. These results illustrate that UniFrac provides
a new way of characterizing microbial communities, using the wealth of environmental rRNA sequences, and
allows quantitative insight into the factors that underlie the distribution of lineages among environments.
Sequencing of 16S rRNA genes from environmental samples
has revealed that microbial diversity is far more extensive than
had ever been imagined from studies of cultured microorgan-
isms alone and that microorganisms represent the majority of
the phylogenetic diversity of life on earth (34). Culture-inde-
pendent studies of microbial populations were pioneered in
the Pace lab in 1985 (35, 36); the technique is now so prevalent
that an estimated 151,339 sequences from small-subunit-rRNA
environmental clones had been deposited in GenBank as of 1
August 2005. [We estimated the total number of environmen-
tal clone small-subunit-rRNA gene sequences published in
GenBank with an Entrez search with the string “(SSU OR 16S
OR 18S OR small subunit) AND (rRNA OR rDNA OR ribo-
somal RNA) AND (uncult OR unidentiﬁed OR unknown)”
(modiﬁed from reference 37).] Only half of the 52 major bac-
terial lineages described in the last comprehensive review have
cultivated representatives, and widespread, numerically domi-
nant phylotypes are often only distantly related to culturable
strains (37). Thus, our sole source of information about the
biology of much of the diversity of life is the environmental
distribution of sequences.
Several statistical techniques have been developed to use
environmental 16S rRNA clone sequences to compare micro-
bial communities between samples. Unfortunately, many of
these techniques are limited because they do not account for
the different degrees of similarity between sequences. Se-
quences are usually grouped if their 16S rRNA genes are 95 to
99% identical (16, 30); with a cutoff of 98%, such techniques
would treat sequences with 3% and 40% sequence divergence
equally. This results in a substantial loss of information since 16S
rRNA and phenotypic variances are positively correlated (33).
Techniques with this limitation include the Sørenson and Jaccard
indices of group overlap (28), the LibShuff (40; http://www.arches
.uga.edu/whitman/libshuff.html) and -LibShuff (39; http://www
.plantpath.wisc.edu/fac/joh/S-LibShuff.html) methods, and hierar-
chical clustering and ordination of samples based on the distribu-
tion of sequences belonging to different groups (17).
Phylogenetic distance measures can provide far more power
because they exploit the degree of divergence between differ-
ent sequences. Two phylogenetic approaches that assess
whether communities differ signiﬁcantly in composition, the P
and FST tests, have recently been developed (30). The P test
uses parsimony to determine whether the distribution of mod-
ern sequences in different environments reﬂects a history of
fewer changes between environments than would be expected
by chance. The FST test identiﬁes cases where more sequence
variation exists between two communities than within a single
community. Although these techniques greatly increase our
ability to test for differences between pairs of communities,
they have only been applied to determining whether samples
are signiﬁcantly different and have not been used to compare
many samples simultaneously with clustering or ordination
techniques. In addition, neither measure accounts for branch
length information when comparing samples.
Here we introduce a new phylogenetic method, called Uni-
Frac, that measures the distance between communities based
on the lineages they contain. UniFrac can be used to compare
many samples simultaneously because it satisﬁes the technical

requirements for a distance metric (it is always positive, is
transitive, and satisﬁes the triangle inequality) and can thus be
used with standard multivariate statistics such as unweighted-
pair group method using average linkages (UPGMA) cluster-
ing (9) and principal coordinate analysis (23). Similarly, Uni-
Frac is more powerful than nonphylogenetic distance measures
because it exploits the different degrees of similarity between
sequences. To demonstrate the utility of the UniFrac metric
for comparing multiple community samples and determining
the factors that explain the most variation, we compared bac-
terial populations in different types of geographically dispersed
marine environments.
Small-subunit-rRNA gene surveys have been performed in
many marine environments, including oligotrophic open-
ocean (11), coastal temperate (1, 22) and polar (2, 8) seawater,
polar sea ice (3, 6, 7), and marine sediments (4, 5, 25, 38).
Comparing this range of samples using the UniFrac technique
provides a coherent picture of the distribution of bacterial
lineages that provides a context for many individual published
observations while allowing us to test speciﬁc ideas about the
distribution of bacterial lineages. In particular, we asked the
following questions.
How does culturing affect similarities between samples?
Few organisms in environmental samples are culturable, but it
is unknown whether the cultured isolates from an environment
yield communities that resemble the communities from the
original habitat. We addressed this issue by comparing gene
libraries from both cultured bacteria and uncultured environ-
mental samples of marine ice, water, and sediment to test
whether the cultured samples appeared more similar to uncul-
tured samples from the same environment or to each other.
How cosmopolitan are bacterial lineages? Although many
studies have suggested that bacteria are mostly cosmopolitan
(11, 13, 32, 45), others have suggested that for certain habitats,
such as the Arctic and Antarctic, geographical separation plays
a major role in structuring communities because of difﬁculties
in dispersal (in this case, of transferring psychrophilic bacteria
across the warm equatorial region) (2, 42). We addressed this
controversy by comparing marine ice and sediment from the
Arctic and Antarctic.
Are marine ice, sediment, and seawater three distinct, ho-
mogeneous habitats? Marine ice, sediment, and water are gen-
erally treated in the literature as distinct habitat types with
distinct challenges. We compared 16S rRNA libraries from
geographically diverse marine water, sediment, and ice sam-
ples to test whether these habitat types harbor consistent bac-
terial communities that differ from one another.
UniFrac metric. The unique fraction metric, or UniFrac,
measures the phylogenetic distance between sets of taxa in a
phylogenetic tree as the fraction of the branch length of the
tree that leads to descendants from either one environment or
the other, but not both (Fig. 1). This measure thus captures the
total amount of evolution that is unique to each state, presum-
ably reﬂecting adaptation to one environment that would be
deleterious in the other. rRNA is used purely as a phylogenetic
marker, indicating the relative amount of sequence evolution
that has occurred in each environment. Intuitively, if two en-
vironments are similar, few adaptations would be needed to
transfer from one community to the other. Consequently, most
nodes in a phylogenetic tree would have descendants from
both communities, and much of the branch length in the tree
would be shared (Fig. 1A). In contrast, if two communities are
so distinct that an organism adapted to one could not survive
in the other, then the lineages in each community would be
distinct, and most of the branch length in the tree would lead
to descendants from only one of the two communities (Fig.
1B).
Like the P test and the FST test, UniFrac can be used to
determine whether two communities differ signiﬁcantly by us-
ing Monte Carlo simulations. Two communities are considered
different if the fraction of the tree unique to one environment
is greater than would be expected by chance. We performed
randomizations by keeping the tree constant and randomizing
the environment that was assigned to each sequence in the tree
(Fig. 1C).
UniFrac can also be used to produce a distance matrix de-
scribing the pairwise phylogenetic distances between the sets of
sequences collected from many different microbial communi-
ties (Fig. 1D). We compared two samples by removing from
the tree all sequences that were not in either sample and
computing the UniFrac for each reduced tree. Standard mul-
tivariate statistics, such as UPGMA clustering (9) and principal
coordinate analysis (23), can then be applied to the distance
matrix to allow comparisons between the biotas in different
environments (Fig. 1D).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Environmental samples. We analyzed 20 small-subunit-rRNA sequence li-
braries generated in 12 different studies of marine environments (Table 1). For
studies reporting both cultured and uncultured sequences or sampling from
multiple environment types, we used sequence annotations to distinguish the
different sampling methods and to assign sequences to speciﬁc environmental
samples.
Three of the studies evaluated bacterial communities in Arctic and/or Antarc-
tic sea ice based on cultured isolates (3), environmental clones (7), or both (6).
Five of the studies derived sequences from the water columns of marine envi-
ronments, including pelagic bacteria from the North Sea (8), bacterioplankton
assemblages from the Arctic Ocean (2), subsurface subtropical waters of the
Atlantic and Paciﬁc oceans (11), and temperate coastal water in the Great South
Bay in Long Island (22) and from the marine end of the Plum Island Sound
estuary in northeastern Massachusetts (1). The remaining four studies examined
marine sediment, including sediments from off the coast of Spitzbergen in the
Arctic Ocean (38), associated with Calyptogena communities in the deepest
cold-seep area in the Japan Trench (25), and from the Antarctic continental shelf
(4, 5). While three of the sediment papers reported sequences from multiple
sediment cores in the same region (4, 25, 38), one reported sequences from three
different depths within a single sediment core (5).
Sequences from the 12 studies were initially assigned to 23 samples. After the
removal of sequences with many sequencing errors and nonbacterial sequences,
the samples contained between 9 and 544 sequences. Small samples could pro-
duce misleading results because of stochastic variation in the subset of the
lineages sampled. To avoid these effects, we excluded from the analysis three
samples represented by 12 or fewer sequences. These included samples contain-
ing 9 sequences from uncultured clones in the North Sea (8), 10 sequences from
Arctic sea ice (7), and 12 sequences from cultured isolates in Arctic seawater
underlying sea ice (3). After the removal of these sequences, each sample was
represented by at least 17 sequences (Table 1).
Data analysis. We implemented UniFrac and associated analyses in Python
2.3.4 and ran all calculations on a Macintosh G4 computer running OSX 10.3.8.
All code is available at http://bayes.colorado.edu/unifrac.zip. We implemented
UPGMA clustering (9) and principal coordinate analysis (23) as described pre-
viously.
We downloaded small-subunit-rRNA sequences generated in the 12 different
studies of marine environments (Table 1) from GenBank, imported them into
the Arb package (26), and aligned them using a combination of the Arb auto-
aligner and manual curation. Because several studies used bacterium-speciﬁc

primers, we excluded all nonbacterial sequences from the analysis. We added the
aligned sequences to a tree representing a range of phylogenetic groups from the
Ribosomal Database Project II (29) by Phil Hugenholtz (15). This sequence
addition used the parsimony insertion tool and a lane mask (lanemaskPH)
supplied in the same database so that only phylogenetically conserved regions
were considered. We exported the tree from Arb and annotated each sequence
with 1 of 20 sample designations (Table 1). We then performed signiﬁcance tests,
UPGMA clustering, and principal coordinate analysis using UniFrac.
Jackkniﬁng. We used jackkniﬁng to determine how the number and evenness
of sequences in the different environments affected the UPGMA clustering
results. Speciﬁcally, we repeated the UniFrac analysis with trees that contained
only a subset of the sequences and measured the number of times we recovered
each node that occurred in the UPGMA tree from the full data set. In each
simulation, we evaluated 100 reduced trees in which all of the environments were
represented by the same speciﬁed number of sequences, using sample sizes of 17,
20, 31, 36, 40, and 58 sequences. These thresholds reﬂect the sample sizes from
different environments in our original data set. If an environment had more than
the speciﬁed number of sequences, we removed sequences at random; environ-
ments with fewer sequences were removed from the tree entirely.
RESULTS
We used UniFrac to determine which of the microbial com-
munities represented by the 20 different samples were signiﬁ-
cantly different (Table 2) and as the basis for a distance matrix
to cluster the samples using UPGMA (Fig. 2) and to perform
principal coordinate analysis (Fig. 3). We used jackkniﬁng to
assess conﬁdence in the nodes of the UPGMA tree (Table 3).

Branches attached to nodes are colored black if they are unique to a particular environment and gray if they are shared. (A) Tree representing
phylogenetically similar communities, where a signiﬁcant fraction of the branch length in the tree is shared (gray). (B) Tree representing two
communities that are maximally different so that 100% of the branch length is unique to either the circle or square environment. (C) Using the
UniFrac metric to determine if the circle and square communities are signiﬁcantly different. For n replicates (r), the environment assignments of
the sequences were randomized, and the fraction of unique (black) branch lengths was calculated. The reported P value is the fraction of random
trees that have at least as much unique branch length as the true tree (arrow). If this P value is below a deﬁned threshold, the samples are
considered to be signiﬁcantly different. (D) The UniFrac metric can be calculated for all pairwise combinations of environments in a tree to make
a distance matrix. This matrix can be used with standard multivariate statistical techniques such as UPGMA and principal coordinate analysis to
compare the biotas in the environments.

The results show biologically meaningful patterns that unite
many individual observations in the literature and reveal sev-
eral striking features of microbial communities in marine en-
vironments.
Samples from cultured isolates resemble each other rather
than uncultured samples from the same environment. Al-
though most bacteria in seawater and sediment cannot be
cultivated with standard techniques (8, 10, 18, 38), most bac-
teria in sea ice are thought to be culturable, as sea ice samples
have a high viable/total count ratio (6, 14, 19) and considerable
overlap in phylotypes between cultured and uncultured sam-
ples (6, 7). To test this hypothesis, we examined the relation-

ship between cultured isolates and environmental clone se-
quences derived from the same locations for sediment (SNC4
and SNU3), seawater (WTC11 and WTU10), and ice from
both the Arctic (IRC17 and IRU16) and Antarctic (INC19 and
INU18) (see Table 1 for an explanation of sample abbrevia-
tions). We also included additional cultured samples from sea-
water (WTC9) and cultured and uncultured samples from ice
(INC15 and INU20).
Cultured and uncultured sea ice bacteria cluster with each
other and with the other cultured isolates (Fig. 2). This asso-
ciation is well supported by jackknife values (Table 3). The
node that groups the cultured and uncultured ice samples
together (Fig. 2, N10) is recovered 100% of the time, with 58
sequences per sample (note that at this point only ﬁve of the six
ice samples are still in the tree because one sample has only 20
sequences). Pairwise signiﬁcance tests for differences between
environments further support this observation (Table 2). The
cultured component of the Antarctic ice sample (INC19) does
not differ signiﬁcantly from environmental clones from the
same sample (INU18).
In contrast, bacteria cultured from sediment (SNC4) and
seawater (WTC11 and WTC9) cluster with other cultured sam-
ples rather than with environmental clones from the same
studies (SNU3 and WTU10) in the UPGMA tree. This obser-
vation is again supported by jackknife values (Table 3). With
31 sequences, SNC4 clusters with the other cultured sequences
64% of the time (Table 3, N9) but never clusters with SNU3 or
exclusively with the sediment samples (data not shown). Like-
wise, with 36 sequences per sample, WTC9 clusters with other
cultured sequences 96% of the time (Table 3, N10). In addi-
tion, pairwise signiﬁcance tests (Table 2) show that the cultur-
able components of a seawater sample (WTC11) and a sedi-
ment
sample
(SNC4)
differ
signiﬁcantly
from
the
environmental clone sequences from the same environment
(WTU10 and SNU3, respectively) but not from cultured sam-
ples from different environments.
The sequences of the culturable components of the seawater
and sediment samples most resemble the environmental clone
sequences from sea ice. This observation is best illustrated by
principal coordinate analysis (Fig. 3). In principal coordinate
analysis, a distance matrix is used to plot n samples in n-

dimensional space. The vector through the space that describes
as much variation as possible is principal coordinate 1. Orthog-
onal axes are subsequently assigned to explain as much of the
variation not yet explained by previously assigned axes as pos-
sible. When few independent factors cause most of the varia-
tion, the ﬁrst two or three principal coordinates often explain
most of the variation in the data. In this case, the ﬁrst four
principal coordinates describe 41% of the variation, suggesting
that many independent factors cause variation between sam-
ples (as might be expected for such diverse environments).
Strikingly, plots of the principal components produce biologi-
cally meaningful clusters of samples, even though the individ-
ual components account for little of the variation (Fig. 3).
The ﬁrst principal coordinate, which explains 17% of the
variation in the data, clearly separates all samples of cultured
isolates and uncultured ice from all samples of uncultured
sediment and seawater (Fig. 3). This result suggests that bac-
teria capable of growing either in sea ice or in pure culture
share some property, such as the ability to grow rapidly in the
absence of symbionts, that is the largest factor contributing to
the variation between these samples.
Geography plays a minor role in structuring communities
compared to the environment type. Our analyses support the
hypothesis that geography plays a minimal role in structuring
bacterial communities and that bacterial types are dispersed
widely in similar habitat types across the globe (11, 13, 32). Sea
ice samples from the Arctic (IRU16 and IRC17) did not sep-
arate from those from the Antarctic (INC15, INU18, INC19,
and INU20) in either the UPGMA or principal coordinate
clusters (Fig. 2 and 3). Similarly, bacterial community samples
from Antarctic sediment (SNU3 and -5 to -7) cluster with those
from sediments from the Arctic (SRU1) and Japan (STU2)
(Fig. 2). This result shows that, as expected, the environment
type (ice, seawater, or sediment) dominates the differences
between communities. Within an environment type, we found
no support for the hypothesis that samples from each pole
would form a discrete cluster. This result may indicate that
other differences between the samples had a greater impact on
bacterial composition than being located on opposite sides of
the earth and contradicts the prediction that the communities
in the Arctic and Antarctic would differ because of difﬁculties
in dispersing psychrophilic bacteria across the warm equatorial
region (42). However, the poor jackknife values for resolving
these nodes (Table 2, nodes N3, N14, and N16) may indicate
that more sequences and more samples are needed to resolve
this issue deﬁnitively.
Uncultured bacterial communities in sediment and ice form
distinct clusters, but communities in seawater samples do not.
Finally, our analyses support the hypothesis that each marine
sediment and ice community analyzed here forms a distinct
group. Environmental clone libraries from each of these types
of environment cluster together by UPGMA (Fig. 2), even
though they were retrieved from very different locations (Table
1). In addition, uncultured sediment samples always differ sig-
niﬁcantly from seawater and ice samples but differ little from
each other (Table 2). For instance, bacteria in sediment cores
from the Antarctic continental shelf (SNU3), the Arctic coastal
region (SRU1), and the deepest cold-seep area of the Japan
Trench (STU2) did not signiﬁcantly differ, despite large differ-
ences in depth, proximity to land, and geographical location.
With 58 sequences, the four remaining sediment samples
grouped together 63% of the time (Table 3, N2).
In contrast, seawater samples do not all cluster together but
are grouped in biologically meaningful ways. For instance, an
Arctic seawater sample (WRU8) clusters with an Arctic sea ice
sample in the UPGMA cluster (Fig. 2). Nutrient-rich coastal
seawater communities (WTU10 and WTU12) cluster together,
as do oligotrophic open ocean communities (WPU13 and
WPU14) (Fig. 2 and 3). These associations are often supported
by jackknife values. For instance, with only 17 sequences,
WPU12 and WPU14 group together 97% of the time (Table 2,
N18), and with 58 sequences, WTU12 groups with WTU10
50% of the time (Table 2, N17) and with WRU8 49% of the
time (data not shown). In contrast, nodes that group all of the
seawater samples together are only rarely observed (5% of the
time for groups with 17 sequences and 4% of the time for
groups with 40 sequences). Thus, there are major differences in
bacterial communities between different types of seawater,
suggesting that, unlike marine sediment and ice, seawater
should not be considered a distinct, homogeneous environ-
ment.
The bacterial community in the Arctic seawater sample
(WRU8) appears to be more similar to those in coastal water
(WTU10 and WTU12) than to those in open ocean seawater
(WPU13 and WPU14). This community clusters closer to the
coastal communities in both UPGMA and principal coordinate
analyses (Fig. 2 and 3). One possible explanation is that like
the coastal communities, the Arctic Ocean has high inputs of
terrigenous matter: it is estimated that 25% of the dissolved
organic carbon in the Arctic Ocean is derived from river runoff
(44).
The
terrestrially
impacted
seawater
communities
(WTU10, WTU12, and WRU8) also resemble the communi-
ties in sediment samples. This is most clearly shown in princi-
pal coordinate analyses, where they cluster near each other in
PC1 and PC2 but clearly separate along PC3 (Fig. 3).
DISCUSSION
The detection of biologically meaningful patterns of varia-
tion between marine samples illustrates the utility of UniFrac
for explaining the distribution of bacterial lineages in the en-
vironment. The ability of UniFrac to integrate sequence data
from many diverse studies makes it suitable for large-scale
comparisons between environments. The ability of UniFrac to
integrate sequence data from many diverse studies makes it
suitable for large-scale comparisons, between environments
despite variability in data collection techniques. For instance,
different studies used different sequencing primers, and thus
little of the 16S rRNA molecule was present in all sequences in
the alignment. This made it impossible to use algorithms that
require the same sequence region to create the phylogenetic
tree for analysis. Potential imperfections in the Arb parsimony
insertion tool for creating the phylogeny, however, were not
great enough to confound the detection of biologically mean-
ingful patterns of variation.
Those who performed the previous studies also chose clones
for sequencing using different methods: some screened clones
with restriction enzyme-based techniques (6–8, 22, 25, 38) or
denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (2, 4) prior to sequenc-
ing, while some sequenced samples directly (1, 5, 11). Since

UniFrac does not count the number of times each sequence is
observed, these data can still be compared, although the “even-
ness” component that is a standard measure of diversity (27) is
not currently represented in UniFrac. Since we compared en-
vironments on a large scale, the ability of particular lineages of
organisms to survive in each environment is more likely to
represent the relevant aspects of similarity between environ-
ments than the relative abundance of each surviving lineage.
However, although the practice of predicting abundance from
environmental clone data is sometimes questioned because of
PCR bias and differences in genomic DNA extraction methods
and rRNA copy numbers (21, 43), such data can be useful,
especially on smaller spatial and temporal scales (20, 24, 31,
41). We have thus also developed a variant of the algorithm
that weights the phylogenetic differences according to the
abundance of each lineage, which will allow questions about
evenness to be addressed.
Jackkniﬁng the UPGMA tree revealed that surprisingly
small sample sizes can be sufﬁcient to detect associations be-
tween groups of samples. For example, the oligotrophic sea-
water samples WPU13 and WPU14 cluster together stably with
only 17 sequences. However, samples that are more diverse,
such as those from sediments, or less distinct, such as the
Antarctic and Arctic ice samples, require more sequences for
robust conclusions to be drawn. We recently demonstrated that
UniFrac is robust even for very similar samples when the
sample size is large. We were able to detect an association
between kinship and gut microbial community structure in
related mice, using sequence sets of 200 to 500 per mouse (24).
We thus expect that the utility of UniFrac will increase as
larger environmental samples become available.
Our analysis provides a uniﬁed framework for explaining
previous observations in the literature, such as the observation
that culturing affects the observed diversity in seawater and
sediment but not that in ice. It also allows broader conclusions,
such as the observation that terrestrially impacted seawater
samples from polar and temperate climates resemble each
other and sediment samples but differ greatly from tropical
oligotrophic seawater samples. Terrestrially impacted seawater
probably resembles sediment more than oligotrophic seawater
for reasons other than relative nutrient availability, since one
sediment sample (STU2) was obtained from 6,400 m below sea
level and received low inputs of organic carbon (25). The
resemblance may instead arise because terrestrially impacted
seawater has a higher concentration of particles, and particle-
associated and freely suspended marine bacteria are known to
differ (12).
The large differences between different seawater communi-
ties are surprising, since the ubiquity of certain bacterial lin-
eages in pelagic systems, such as SAR11 and SAR86, has been
taken as evidence that much of the ocean harbors similar
bacteria (11, 22). In contrast, the different sediment samples
are remarkably similar. This supports the hypothesis that large
portions of the sea ﬂoor have similar biotas because of similar
environmental conditions such as nutrient availability and tem-
perature (e.g., 90% of the sea ﬂoor has temperatures below
4°C) and similar processes such as sulfate reduction (7, 38).
Conclusion. The utility of UniFrac for making broad com-
parisons between the biotas of different environments based on
16S rRNA sequences has enormous potential to shed light on
biological factors that structure microbial communities. The
vast wealth of 16S rRNA sequences in GenBank and of envi-
ronmental information about these sequences in the literature,
combined with powerful phylogenetic tools, will greatly en-
hance our understanding of how microbial communities adapt
to unique environmental challenges.
