An integrated encyclopedia of DNA
elements in the human genome
The ENCODE Project Consortium*
The human genome encodes the blueprint of life, but the function of the vast majority of its nearly three billion bases is
unknown. The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project has systematically mapped regions of transcription,
transcription factor association, chromatin structure and histone modification. These data enabled us to assign
biochemical functions for 80% of the genome, in particular outside of the well-studied protein-coding regions. Many
discovered candidate regulatory elements are physically associated with one another and with expressed genes,
providing new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation. The newly identified elements also show a statistical
correspondence to sequence variants linked to human disease, and can thereby guide interpretation of this variation.
Overall, the project provides new insights into the organization and regulation of our genes and genome, and is an
expansive resource of functional annotations for biomedical research.
The human genome sequence provides the
underlying code for human biology. Despite
intensive
study,
especially
in
identifying
protein-coding genes, our understanding of the
genome is far from complete, particularly with
regard to non-coding RNAs, alternatively spliced transcripts and reg-
ulatory sequences. Systematic analyses of transcripts and regulatory
information are essential for the identification of genes and regulatory
regions, and are an important resource for the study of human biology
and disease. Such analyses can also provide comprehensive views of the
organization and variability of genes and regulatory information across
cellular contexts, species and individuals.
The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project aims to
delineate all functional elements encoded in the human genome1–3.
Operationally, we define a functional element as a discrete genome
segment that encodes a defined product (for example, protein or
non-coding RNA) or displays a reproducible biochemical signature
(for example, protein binding, or a specific chromatin structure).
Comparative genomic studies suggest that 3–8% of bases are under
purifying (negative) selection4–8 and therefore may be functional,
although other analyses have suggested much higher estimates9–11.
In a pilot phase covering 1% of the genome, the ENCODE project
annotated 60% of mammalian evolutionarily constrained bases, but
also identified many additional putative functional elements without
evidence of constraint2. The adventof more powerfulDNAsequencing
technologies now enables whole-genome and more precise analyses
with a broad repertoire of functional assays.
Here we describe the production and initial analysis of 1,640 data
sets designed to annotate functional elements in the entire human
genome. We integrate results from diverse experiments within cell types,
related experiments involving 147 different cell types, and all ENCODE
data with other resources, such as candidate regions from genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) and evolutionarily constrained regions.
Together, these efforts reveal important features about the organization
and function of the human genome, summarized below.
. The vast majority (80.4%) of the human genome participates in at
least one biochemical RNA- and/or chromatin-associated event in at
least one cell type. Much of the genome lies close to a regulatory event:
95% of the genome lies within 8 kilobases (kb)
of a DNA–protein interaction (as assayed by
bound ChIP-seq motifs or DNase I footprints),
and 99% is within 1.7 kb of at least one of the
biochemical events measured by ENCODE.
. Primate-specific elements as well as elements without detectable
mammalian constraint show, in aggregate, evidence of negative selec-
tion; thus, some of them are expected to be functional.
. Classifying the genomeinto seven chromatin states indicates an initial
set of 399,124 regions with enhancer-like features and 70,292 regions
with promoter-like features, as well as hundreds of thousands of qui-
escent regions. High-resolution analyses further subdivide the genome
into thousands of narrow states with distinct functional properties.
. It is possible to correlate quantitatively RNA sequence production
and processing with both chromatin marks and transcription factor
binding at promoters, indicating that promoter functionality can
explain most of the variation in RNA expression.
. Many non-coding variants in individual genome sequences lie in
ENCODE-annotated functional regions; this number is at least as
large as those that lie in protein-coding genes.
. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with disease by
GWAS are enriched within non-coding functional elements, with a
majority residing in or near ENCODE-defined regions that are out-
side of protein-coding genes. In many cases, the disease phenotypes
can be associated with a specific cell type or transcription factor.
ENCODE data production and initial analyses
Since 2007, ENCODE has developed methods and performed a large
number of sequence-based studies to map functional elements across
the human genome3. The elements mapped (and approaches used)
include RNA transcribed regions (RNA-seq, CAGE, RNA-PET and
manual annotation), protein-coding regions (mass spectrometry),
transcription-factor-binding
sites
(ChIP-seq
and
DNase-seq),
chromatin structure (DNase-seq, FAIRE-seq, histone ChIP-seq and
MNase-seq), and DNA methylation sites (RRBS assay) (Box 1 lists
methods and abbreviations; Supplementary Table 1, section P, details
production statistics)3. To compare and integrate results across the
different laboratories, data production efforts focused on two selected

sets of cell lines, designated ‘tier 1’ and ‘tier 2’ (Box 1). To capture a
broader spectrum of biological diversity, selected assays were also
executed on a third tier comprising more than 100 cell types including
primary cells. All data and protocol descriptions are available at
http://www.encodeproject.org/, and a User’s Guide including details
of cell-type choice and limitations was published recently3.
Integration methodology
Forconsistency,datawere generatedand processedusing standardized
guidelines, and for some assays, new quality-control measures were
designed (see refs 3, 12 and http://encodeproject.org/ENCODE/
dataStandards.html; A. Kundaje, personal communication). Uniform
data-processing methods were developed for each assay (see
Supplementary Information; A. Kundaje, personal communication),
and most assay results can be represented both as signal information
(a per-base estimate across the genome) and as discrete elements
(regions computationally identified as enriched for signal). Extensive
processing pipelines were developed to generate each representation
(M. M. Hoffman et al., manuscript in preparation and A. Kundaje,
personalcommunication).Inaddition,wedevelopedtheirreproducible
discovery rate (IDR)13 measure to provide a robust and conservative
estimate of the threshold where two ranked lists of results from bio-
logical replicates no longer agree (that is, are irreproducible), and we
applied this to defining sets of discrete elements. We identified, and
excluded from most analyses, regions yielding untrustworthy signals
likelyto beartefactual(forexample,multicopy regions).Together,these
regions
comprise
0.39%
of
the
genome
(see
Supplementary
Information). The poster accompanying this issue represents different
ENCODE-identified elements and their genome coverage.
Transcribed and protein-coding regions
We used manual and automated annotation to produce a compre-
hensive catalogue of human protein-coding and non-coding RNAs as
well as pseudogenes, referred to as the GENCODE reference gene
set14,15 (Supplementary Table 1, section U). This includes 20,687
protein-coding genes (GENCODE annotation, v7) with, on average,
6.3 alternatively spliced transcripts (3.9 different protein-coding tran-
scripts) per locus. In total, GENCODE-annotated exons of protein-
coding genes cover 2.94% of the genome or 1.22% for protein-coding
exons. Protein-coding genes span 33.45% from the outermost start to
stop codons, or 39.54% from promoter to poly(A) site. Analysis of
mass spectrometry data from K562 and GM12878 cell lines yielded 57
confidently identified unique peptide sequences in intergenic regions
relative to GENCODE annotation. Taken together with evidence of
pervasive genome transcription16, these data indicate that additional
protein-coding genes remain to be found.
In addition, we annotated 8,801 automatically derived small RNAs
and 9,640 manually curated long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) loci17.
Comparing lncRNAs to other ENCODE data indicates that lncRNAs
are generated through a pathway similar to that for protein-coding
genes17. The GENCODE project also annotated 11,224 pseudogenes,
of which 863 were transcribed and associated with active chromatin18.
RNA
We sequenced RNA16 from different cell lines and multiple subcellular
fractions to develop an extensive RNA expression catalogue. Using a
conservative threshold to identify regions of RNA activity, 62% of
genomic bases are reproducibly represented in sequenced long (.200
nucleotides) RNA molecules or GENCODE exons. Of these bases, only
5.5% are explained by GENCODE exons. Most transcribed bases are
withinoroverlappingannotatedgeneboundaries (thatis,intronic),and
only 31% of bases in sequenced transcripts were intergenic16.
We used CAGE-seq (59 cap-targeted RNA isolation and sequencing)
to identify 62,403 transcription start sites (TSSs) at high confidence
(IDR of 0.01) in tier 1 and 2 cell types. Of these, 27,362 (44%) are within
100 base pairs (bp) of the 59 end of a GENCODE-annotated transcript
or previously reported full-length messenger RNA. The remaining
regions predominantly lie across exons and 39 untranslated regions
(UTRs), and some exhibit cell-type-restricted expression; these may
represent the start sites of novel, cell-type-specific transcripts.
Finally, we saw a significant proportion of coding and non-coding
transcripts processed into steady-state stable RNAs shorter than 200
nucleotides. These precursors include transfer RNA, microRNA,
small nuclear RNA and small nucleolar RNA (tRNA, miRNA,
snRNA and snoRNA, respectively) and the 59 termini of these pro-
cessed products align with the capped 59 end tags16.
BOX 1
ENCODE abbreviations
RNA-seq. Isolation of RNA sequences, often with different purification
techniques to isolate different fractions of RNA followed by high-
throughput sequencing.
CAGE. Capture of themethylated cap at the 59 end of RNA, followed by
high-throughput sequencing of a small tag adjacent to the
59 methylated caps. 59 methylated caps are formed at the initiation of
transcription, although other mechanisms also methylate 59 ends of
RNA.
RNA-PET. Simultaneous capture of RNAs with both a 59 methyl cap
and a poly(A) tail, which is indicative of a full-length RNA. This is then
followed by sequencing a short tag from each end by high-throughput
sequencing.
ChIP-seq. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing.
Specific regions of crosslinked chromatin, which is genomic DNA in
complexwithitsbound proteins,areselected by usinganantibodytoa
specific epitope. The enriched sample is then subjected to high-
throughput sequencing to determine the regions in the genome most
often bound by the protein to which the antibody was directed. Most
often used are antibodies to any chromatin-associated epitope,
including transcription factors, chromatin binding proteins and
specific chemical modifications on histone proteins.
DNase-seq. Adaption of established regulatory sequence assay to
modern techniques. The DNase I enzyme will preferentially cut live
chromatin preparations at sites where nearby there are specific (non-
histone) proteins. The resulting cut points are then sequenced using
high-throughput sequencing to determine those sites ‘hypersensitive’
to DNase I, corresponding to open chromatin.
FAIRE-seq. Formaldehyde assisted isolation of regulatory elements.
FAIRE isolates nucleosome-depleted genomic regions by exploiting
the difference in crosslinking efficiency between nucleosomes (high)
and sequence-specific regulatory factors (low). FAIRE consists of
crosslinking, phenol extraction, and sequencing the DNA fragments in
the aqueous phase.
RRBS. Reduced representation bisulphite sequencing. Bisulphite
treatment of DNA sequence converts unmethylated cytosines to
uracil. To focus the assay and save costs, specific restriction enzymes
thatcutaround CpG dinucleotidescan reducethe genometoa portion
specifically enriched in CpGs.This enrichedsample is thensequenced
to determine the methylation status of individual cytosines
quantitatively.
Tier 1. Tier 1 cell types were the highest-priority set and comprised
three widely studied cell lines: K562 erythroleukaemia cells;
GM12878, a B-lymphoblastoid cell line that is also part of the 1000
Genomesproject(http://1000genomes.org)55;and theH1embryonic
stem cell (H1 hESC) line.
Tier 2. The second-priority set of cell types in the ENCODE project
which included HeLa-S3 cervical carcinoma cells, HepG2
hepatoblastoma cells and primary (non-transformed) human
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).
Tier 3. Any other ENCODE cell types not in tier 1 or tier 2.

Protein bound regions
To identify regulatory regions directly, we mapped the binding loca-
tions of 119 different DNA-binding proteins and a number of RNA
polymerase components in 72 cell types using ChIP-seq (Table 1,
Supplementary Table 1, section N, and ref. 19); 87 (73%) were
sequence-specific transcription factors. Overall, 636,336 binding
regions covering 231 megabases (Mb; 8.1%) of the genome are
enriched for regions bound by DNA-binding proteins across all cell
types. We assessed each protein-binding site for enrichment of known
DNA-binding motifs and the presence of novel motifs. Overall, 86%
of the DNA segments occupied by sequence-specific transcription
factors contained a strong DNA-binding motif, and in most (55%)
cases the known motif was most enriched (P. Kheradpour and
M. Kellis, manuscript in preparation).
Protein-binding regions lacking high or moderate affinity cognate
recognition sites have 21% lower median scores by rank than regions
with recognition sequences (Wilcoxon rank sum P value ,10216).
Eighty-two per cent of the low-signal regions have high-affinity recog-
nition sequences for other factors. In addition, when ChIP-seq peaks
are ranked by their concordance with their known recognition
sequence, the median DNase I accessibility is twofold higher in the
bottom 20% of peaks than in the upper 80% (genome structure
correction (GSC)20 P value ,10216), consistent with previous
observations21–24. We speculate that low signal regions are either
lower-affinity sites21 or indirect transcription-factor target regions
associated through interactions with other factors (see also refs 25, 26).
We organized all the information associated with each transcrip-
tion factor—including the ChIP-seq peaks, discovered motifs and
associated histonemodificationpatterns—inFactorBook(http://www.
factorbook.org; ref. 26), a public resource that will be updated as the
project proceeds.
DNase I hypersensitive sites and footprints
Chromatin accessibility characterized by DNase I hypersensitivity is
the hallmark of regulatory DNA regions27,28. We mapped 2.89 million
unique, non-overlapping DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) by
DNase-seq in 125 cell types, the overwhelming majority of which lie
distal to TSSs29. We also mapped 4.8 million sites across 25 cell types
that displayed reduced nucleosomal crosslinking by FAIRE, many of
which coincide with DHSs. In addition, we used micrococcal nuclease
to map nucleosome occupancy in GM12878 and K562 cells30.
In tier 1 and tier 2 cell types, we identified a mean of 205,109 DHSs
per cell type (at false discovery rate (FDR) 1%), encompassing an
average of 1.0% of the genomic sequence in each cell type, and 3.9%
in aggregate. On average, 98.5% of the occupancy sites of transcription
factors mapped by ENCODE ChIP-seq (and, collectively, 94.4% of all
1.1 million transcription factor ChIP-seqpeaksinK562 cells) lie within
accessible chromatin defined by DNase I hotspots29. However, a
small number of factors, most prominently heterochromatin-bound
repressive complexes (for example, the TRIM28–SETDB1–ZNF274
complex31,32 encoded by the TRIM28, SETDB1 and ZNF274 genes),
seem to occupy a significant fraction of nucleosomal sites.
Using genomic DNase I footprinting33,34 on 41 cell types we iden-
tified 8.4 million distinct DNase I footprints (FDR 1%)25. Our de novo
motif discovery on DNase I footprints recovered ,90% of known
transcription factor motifs, together with hundreds of novel evolutio-
narily conserved motifs, many displaying highly cell-selective occu-
pancy patterns similar to major developmental and tissue-specific
regulators.
Regions of histone modification
We assayed chromosomal locations for up to 12 histone modifications
and variants in 46 cell types, including a complete matrix of eight
modifications across tier 1 and tier 2. Because modification states
mayspan multiplenucleosomes,whichthemselves canvaryinposition
across cell populations, we used a continuoussignal measure of histone
modifications in downstream analysis, rather than calling regions
(M. M. Hoffman et al., manuscript in preparation; see http://code.
google.com/p/align2rawsignal/). For the strongest, ‘peak-like’ histone
modifications, we used MACS35 to characterize enriched sites. Table 2
describesthedifferenthistonemodifications,theirpeakcharacteristics,
and a summary of their known roles (reviewed in refs 36–39).
Our data show that global patterns of modification are highly vari-
able across cell types, in accordance with changes in transcriptional
activity. Consistent with previous studies40,41, we find that integration
of the different histone modification information can be used system-
atically to assign functional attributes to genomic regions (see below).
DNA methylation
Methylation of cytosine, usually at CpG dinucleotides, is involved in
epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Promoter methylation is
typically associated with repression, whereas genic methylation cor-
relates with transcriptional activity42. We used reduced representation
bisulphite sequencing (RRBS) to profile DNA methylation quantita-
tively for an average of 1.2 million CpGs in each of 82 cell lines and
tissues (8.6% of non-repetitive genomic CpGs), including CpGs in
intergenic regions, proximal promoters and intragenic regions (gene
bodies)43, although it should be noted that the RRBS method pref-
erentially targets CpG-rich islands. We found that 96% of CpGs
exhibited differential methylation in at least one cell type or tissue

assayed (K. Varley et al., personal communication), and levels of
DNA methylation correlated with chromatin accessibility. The most
variably methylated CpGs are found more often in gene bodies and
intergenic regions, rather than in promoters and upstream regulatory
regions. In addition, we identified an unexpected correspondence
between unmethylated genic CpG islands and binding by P300, a
histone acetyltransferase linked to enhancer activity44.
Because RRBS is a sequence-based assay with single-base resolu-
tion, we were able to identify CpGs with allele-specific methylation
consistent with genomic imprinting, and determined that these loci
exhibit aberrant methylation in cancer cell lines (K. Varley et al.,
personal communication). Furthermore, we detected reproducible
cytosine methylation outside CpG dinucleotides in adult tissues45,
providing further support that this non-canonical methylation event
may have important roles in human biology (K. Varley et al., personal
communication).
Chromosome-interacting regions
Physical interaction between distinct chromosome regions that can be
separated by hundreds of kilobases is thought to be important in the
regulation of gene expression46. We used two complementary chro-
mosome conformation capture (3C)-based technologies to probe
these long-range physical interactions.
A 3C-carbon copy (5C) approach47,48 provided unbiased detection
of long-range interactions with TSSs in a targeted 1% of the genome
(the 44 ENCODE pilot regions) in four cell types (GM12878, K562,
HeLa-S3 and H1 hESC)49. We discovered hundreds of statistically
significant long-range interactions in each cell type after accounting
for chromatin polymer behaviour and experimental variation. Pairs
of interacting loci showed strong correlation between the gene
expression level of the TSS and the presence of specific functional
element classes such as enhancers. The average number of distal ele-
ments interacting with a TSS was 3.9, and the average number of TSSs
interacting with a distal element was 2.5, indicating a complex net-
work of interconnected chromatin. Such interwoven long-range
architecture was also uncovered genome-wide using chromatin inter-
action analysis with paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET)50 applied
to identify interactions in chromatin enriched by RNA polymerase II
(Pol II) ChIP from five cell types51. In K562 cells, we identified 127,417
promoter-centred chromatin interactions using ChIA-PET, 98% of
which were intra-chromosomal. Whereas promoter regions of 2,324
genes were involved in ‘single-gene’ enhancer–promoter interactions,
those of 19,813 genes were involved in ‘multi-gene’ interaction com-
plexes spanning up to several megabases, including promoter–
promoter and enhancer–promoter interactions51.
These analyses portray a complex landscape of long-range gene–
element connectivity across ranges of hundreds of kilobases to several
megabases, including interactions among unrelated genes (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 1, section Y). Furthermore, in the 5C results, 50–60% of long-
range interactions occurred in only one of the four cell lines, indicative
of a high degree of tissue specificity for gene–element connectivity49.
Summary of ENCODE-identified elements
Accounting for all these elements, a surprisingly large amount of the
human genome, 80.4%, is covered by at least one ENCODE-identified
element (detailed in Supplementary Table 1, section Q). The broadest
element class represents the different RNA types, covering 62% of the
genome (although the majority is inside of introns or near genes).
Regions highly enriched for histone modifications form the next
largest class (56.1%). Excluding RNA elements and broad histone
elements, 44.2% of the genome is covered. Smaller proportions of
the genome are occupied by regions of open chromatin (15.2%) or
sites of transcription factor binding (8.1%), with 19.4% covered by at
least one DHS or transcription factor ChIP-seq peak across all cell
lines. Using our most conservative assessment, 8.5% of bases are
covered by either a transcription-factor-binding-site motif (4.6%)
or a DHS footprint (5.7%). This, however, is still about 4.5-fold higher
than the amount of protein-coding exons, and about twofold higher
than the estimated amount of pan-mammalian constraint.
Given that the ENCODE project did not assay all cell types, or all
transcription factors, and in particular has sampled few specialized or
developmentally restricted cell lineages, these proportions must be
underestimates of the total amount of functional bases. However,
many assays were performed on more than one cell type, allowing
assessment of the rate of discovery of new elements. For both DHSs
and CTCF-bound sites, the number of new elements initially increases
rapidly with a steep gradient for the saturation curve and then slows
with increasing number of cell types (Supplementary Figs 1 and 2,
section R). With the current data, at the flattest part of the saturation
curve each new cell type adds, on average, 9,500 DHS elements (across
106 cell types) and 500 CTCF-binding elements (across 49 cell types),
representing 0.45% of the total element number. We modelled
saturation for the DHSs and CTCF-binding sites using a Weibull
distribution (r2 . 0.999) and predict saturation at approximately
4.1 million (standard error (s.e.)5 108,000) and 185,100 (s.e. 518,020)
sites,respectively,indicating thatwehavediscoveredaround halfofthe
estimated total DHSs. These estimates represent a lower bound, but
reinforce the observation that there is more non-coding functional
DNA than either coding sequence or mammalian evolutionarily con-
strained bases.
The impact of selection on functional elements
From comparative genomic studies, at least 3–8% of bases are under
purifying (negative) selection4–11, indicating that these bases may
potentiallybefunctional. Wepreviouslyfound that60% ofmammalian
evolutionarily constrained bases were annotated in the ENCODE pilot
project, but also observed that many functional elements lacked
evidence of constraint2, a conclusion substantiated by others52–54. The
diversity and genome-wide occurrence of functional elements now
identified provides an unprecedented opportunity to examine further
the forces of negative selection on human functional sequences.
We examined negative selection using two measures that highlight
different periods of selection in the human genome. The first measure,
inter-species,
pan-mammalian
constraint
(GERP-based
scores;
24 mammals8), addresses selection during mammalian evolution.
The second measure is intra-species constraint estimated from the
numbers of variants discovered in human populations using data from
the 1000 Genomes project55, and covers selection over human evolu-
tion. In Fig. 1, we plot both these measures of constraint for different
classesofidentifiedfunctionalelements,excludingfeaturesoverlapping
exons and promoters thatare known tobeconstrained.Eachgraph also
shows genomic background levels and measures of coding-gene con-
straint for comparison. Because we plot human population diversity on
an inverted scale, elements that are more constrained by negative selec-
tion will tend to lie in the upper and right-hand regions of the plot.
For DNase I elements (Fig. 1b) and bound motifs (Fig. 1c), most
sets of elements show enrichment in pan-mammalian constraint and
decreased human population diversity, although for some cell types
the DNase I sites do not seem overall to be subject to pan-mammalian
constraint. Bound transcription factor motifs have a natural control
from the set of transcription factor motifs with equal sequence poten-
tial for binding but without binding evidence from ChIP-seq experi-
ments—in all cases, the bound motifs show both more mammalian
constraint and higher suppression of human diversity.
Consistent with previous findings, we do not observe genome-wide
evidence for pan-mammalian selection of novel RNA sequences
(Fig.1d).Therearealsoalargenumberofelementswithoutmammalian
constraint, between 17% and 90% for transcription-factor-binding
regions as well as DHSs and FAIRE regions. Previous studies could
not determine whether these sequences are either biochemically active,
but with little overall impact on the organism, or under lineage-
specific selection. By isolating sequences preferentially inserted into

the primate lineage, which is only feasible given the genome-wide scale
of this data, we are able to examine this issue specifically. Most primate-
specific sequence is due to retrotransposon activity, but an appreciable
proportion is non-repetitive primate-specific sequence. Of 104,343,413
primate-specific bases (excluding repetitive elements), 67,769,372
(65%) are found within ENCODE-identified elements. Examination
of 227,688 variants segregating in these primate-specific regions
revealed that all classes of elements (RNA and regulatory) show
depressed derived allele frequencies, consistent with recent negative
selectionoccurring inatleastsome of theseregions (Fig.1e).An alterna-
tive approach examining sequences that are not clearly under pan-
mammalian constraint showed a similar result (L. Ward and
M. Kellis, manuscript submitted). This indicates that an appreciable
proportion of the unconstrained elements are lineage-specific elements
required for organismal function, consistent with long-standing views
ofrecentevolution56,andtheremainder areprobably‘neutral’elements2
that are not currently under selection but may still affect cellular or
larger scale phenotypes without an effect on fitness.
The binding patterns of transcription factors are not uniform, and
we can correlate both inter- and intra-species measures of negative
selection with the overall information content of motif positions. The
selection on some motif positions is as high as protein-coding exons
(Fig. 1f; L. Ward and M. Kellis, manuscript submitted). These
aggregate measures across motifs show that the binding preferences
found in the population of sites are also relevant to the per-site beha-
viour. By developing a per-site metric of population effect on bound
motifs, we found that highly constrained bound instances across
mammals are able to buffer the impact of individual variation57.
ENCODE data integration with known genomic features
Promoter-anchored integration
Many of the ENCODE assays directly or indirectly provide informa-
tion about the action of promoters. Focusing on the TSSs of protein-
coding transcripts, we investigated the relationships between different
ENCODE assays, in particular testing the hypothesis that RNA
expression (output) can be effectively predicted from patterns of

chromatin modification or transcription factor binding (input).
Consistent with previous reports58, we observe two relatively distinct
typesofpromoter:(1)broad,mainly(C1G)-rich,TATA-lesspromoters;
and (2) narrow, TATA-box-containing promoters. These promoters
have distinct patterns of histone modifications, and transcription-fac-
tor-binding sites are selectively enriched in each class (Supplementary
Fig. 1, section Z).
We developed predictive models to explore the interaction between
histone modifications and measures of transcription at promoters,
distinguishing between modifications known to be added as a con-
sequence of transcription (such as H3K36me3 and H3K79me2) and
other categories of histone marks59. In our analyses, the best models
hadtwocomponents:aninitial classificationcomponent(on/off)anda
second quantitative model component. Our models showed that
activating acetylation marks (H3K27ac and H3K9ac) are roughly
as informative as activating methylation marks (H3K4me3 and
H3K4me2) (Fig. 2a). Although repressive marks, such as H3K27me3
or H3K9me3, show negative correlation both individually and in the
model, removing these marks produces only a small reduction in
model performance. However, for a subset of promoters in each cell
line, repressive histone marks (H3K27me3 or H3K9me3) must be used
to predict their expression accurately. We also examined the interplay
between the H3K79me2 and H3K36me3 marks, both of which mark
gene bodies, probably reflecting recruitment of modification enzymes
by polymerase isoforms. As described previously, H3K79me2 occurs
preferentially at the 59 ends of gene bodies and H3K36me3 occurs
more 39, and our analyses support the previous model in which the
H3K79me2 to H3K36me3 transition occurs at the first 39 splice site60.
Few previous studies have attempted to build qualitative or quant-
itative models of transcription genome-wide from transcription
factor levels because of the paucity of documented transcription-
factor-binding regions and the lack of coordination around a single
cell line. We thus examined the predictive capacity of transcription-
factor-binding signals for the expression levels of promoters (Fig. 2b).

In contrast to the profiles of histone modifications, most transcription
factors show enriched binding signals in a narrow DNA region near
the TSS, with relatively higher binding signals in promoters with
higher CpG content. Most of this correlation could be recapitulated
by looking at the aggregate binding of transcription factors without
specific transcription factor terms. Together, these correlation models
indicate both that a limited set of chromatin marks are sufficient to
‘explain’ transcription and that a variety of transcription factors might
have broad roles in general transcription levels across many genes. It is
important to note that this is an inherently observational study of
correlation patterns, and is consistent with a variety of mechanistic
models with different causal links between the chromatin, transcrip-
tion factor and RNA assays. However, it does indicate that there is
enough information present at the promoter regions of genes to
explain most of the variation in RNA expression.
We developed predictive models similar to those used to model
transcriptional activity to explore the relationship between levels of
histone modification and inclusion of exons in alternately spliced
transcripts. Even accounting for expression level, H3K36me3 has a
positive contribution to exon inclusion, whereas H3K79me2 has a
negative contribution (H. Tilgner et al., manuscript in preparation).
By monitoring the RNA populations in the subcellular fractions of
K562 cells, we found that essentially all splicing is co-transcriptional61,
further supporting a link between chromatin structure and splicing.
Transcription-factor-binding site-anchored integration
Transcription-factor-binding sites provide a natural focus around
which to explore chromatin properties. Transcription factors are often
multifunctional and can bind a variety of genomic loci with different
combinationsand patterns ofchromatin marks andnucleosome organ-
ization.Hence, ratherthanaveragingchromatinmarkprofiles acrossall
binding sites of a transcription factor, we developed a clustering pro-
cedure, termed the Clustered Aggregation Tool (CAGT), to identify
subsets of binding sites sharing similar but distinct patterns of chro-
matin mark signal magnitude, shape and hidden directionality30. For
example, the average profile of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3
over all 55,782 CTCF-binding sites in H1 hESCs shows poor signal
enrichment (Fig. 3a). However, after grouping profiles by signal
magnitude we found a subset of 9,840 (17.6%) CTCF-binding sites
that exhibit significant flanking H3K27me3 signal. Shape and orienta-
tion analysis further revealed that the predominant signal profile for
H3K27me3 around CTCF peak summits is asymmetric, consistent
with a boundary role for some CTCF sites between active and
polycomb-silenced domains. Further examples are provided in
Supplementary Figs 5 and 6 of section E. For TAF1, predominantly
found near TSSs, the asymmetric sites are orientated with the direction
of transcription. However, for distal sites, such as those bound by
GATA1 and CTCF, we also observed a high proportion of asymmetric
histone patterns, although independent of motif directionality. In fact,
all transcription-factor-binding data sets in all cell lines show
predominantly asymmetric patterns (asymmetry ratio .0.6) for all
chromatin marks but not for DNase I signal (Fig. 3b). This indicates
that most transcription-factor-bound chromatin events correlate with
structured, directional patterns of histone modifications, and that pro-
moter directionality is not the only source of orientation at these sites.
We also examined nucleosome occupancy relative to the symmetry
properties of chromatin marks around transcription-factor-binding
sites. Around TSSs, there is usually strong asymmetric nucleosome
occupancy, often accounting for most of the histone modification
signal (for instance, see Supplementary Fig. 4, section E). However,
away from TSSs, there is far less concordance. For example, CTCF-
binding sites typically show arrays of well-positioned nucleosomes on
either side of the peak summit (Supplementary Fig. 1, section E)62.
Where the flanking chromatin mark signal is high, the signals are
often asymmetric, indicating differential marking with histone
modifications (Supplementary Figs 2 and 3, section E). Thus, we
confirm on a genome-wide scale that transcription factors can form
barriers around which nucleosomes and histone modifications are
arranged in a variety of configurations62–65. This is explored in further
detail in refs 25, 26 and 30.

CTCF
CTCF-enriched element
Sites of CTCF signal lacking histone modifications, often associated with open chromatin. Many
probably have a function in insulator assays, but because of the multifunctional nature of CTCF, we
are conservative in our description. Also enriched for the cohesin components RAD21 and SMC3;
CTCF is known to recruit the cohesin complex.

E
Predicted enhancer
Regions of open chromatin associated with H3K4me1 signal. Enriched for other enhancer-
associated marks, including transcription factors known to act at enhancers. In enhancer assays,
many of these (.50%) function as enhancers. A more conservative alternative would be cis-
regulatory regions. Enriched for sites for the proteins encoded by EP300, FOS, FOSL1, GATA2,
HDAC8, JUNB, JUND, NFE2, SMARCA4, SMARCB1, SIRT6 and TAL1 genes in K562 cells. Have
nuclear and whole-cell RNA signal, particularly poly(A)2 fraction.

Light red
R
Predicted repressed or low-activity region This is a merged state that includes H3K27me3 polycomb-enriched regions, along with regions that
are silent in terms of observed signal for the input assays to the segmentations (low or no signal).
They may have other signals (for example, RNA, not in the segmentation input data). Enriched for
sites for the proteins encoded by REST and some other factors (for example, proteins encoded by
BRF2, CEBPB, MAFK, TRIM28, ZNF274 and SETDB1 genes in K562 cells).

TSS
Predicted promoter region including TSS
Found close to or overlapping GENCODE TSS sites. High precision/recall for TSSs. Enriched for
H3K4me3. Sites of open chromatin. Enriched for transcription factors known to act close to promoters
and polymerases Pol II and Pol III. Short RNAs are most enriched in these segments.

a, Illustrative region with the two segmentation methods (ChromHMM and
Segway) in a dense view and the combined segmentation expanded to show
each state in GM12878 cells, beneath a compressed view of the GENCODE
gene annotations. Note that at this level of zoom and genome browser
resolution, some segments appear to overlap although they do not.
Segmentation classes are named and coloured according to the scheme in
Table 3. Beneath the segmentations are shown each of the normalized signals
that were used as the input data for the segmentations. Open chromatin signals
from DNase-seq from the University of Washington group (UW DNase) or the
ENCODE open chromatin group (Openchrom DNase) and FAIRE assays are
shown in blue; signal from histone modification ChIP-seq in red; and
transcription factor ChIP-seq signal for Pol II and CTCF in green. The mauve
ChIP-seq control signal (input control) at the bottom was also included as an
input to the segmentation. b, Association of selected transcription factor (left)

regions separately, this changes to 3,201 pairs (116 factors, 99%) for
promoters and 1,564 pairs (108 factors, 92%) for intergenic regions,
with some associations more specific to these genomic contexts (for
example, the cluster of HDAC2, GABPA, CHD2, GTF2F1, MXI1 and
MYC in promoter regions and SP1, EP300, HDAC2 and NANOG in
intergenic regions (Fig. 4b)). These general and context-dependent
associations lead to a network representation of the co-binding with
many interesting properties, explored in refs 19, 25 and 26. In addition,
we also identified a set of regions bound by multiple factors represent-
ing high occupancy of transcription factor (HOT) regions67.
Genome-wide integration
To identify functional regions genome-wide, we next integrated ele-
ments independent of genomic landmarks using either discriminative
trainingmethods,whereasubsetofknownelementsofaparticularclass
wereusedtotrainamodelthatwasthenusedtodiscovermoreinstances
ofthisclass, orusingmethods in which onlydata fromENCODE assays
were used without explicit knowledge of any annotation.
For discriminative training, we used a three-step process to predict
potential enhancers, described in Supplementary Information and
ref. 67. Two alternative discriminative models converged on a set of
,13,000 putative enhancers in K562 cells67. In the second approach,
two methodologically distinct unbiased approaches (see refs 40, 68
and M. M. Hoffman et al., manuscript in preparation) converged on a
concordant set of histone modification and chromatin-accessibility
patterns that can be used to segment the genome in each of the tier 1
and tier 2 cell lines, although the individual loci in each state in each
cell line are different. With the exception of RNA polymerase II and
CTCF, the addition of transcription factor data did not substantially
alter these patterns. At this stage, we deliberately excluded RNA and
methylation assays, reserving these data as a means to validate the
segmentations.
Our integration of the two segmentation methods (M. M. Hoffman
et al., manuscript in preparation) established a consensus set of seven
major classes of genome states, described in Table 3. The standard
view of active promoters, with a distinct core promoter region (TSS
and PF states), leading to active gene bodies (T, transcribed state), is
rediscovered in this model (Fig. 5a, b). There are three ‘active’ distal
states. We tentatively labelled two as enhancers (predicted enhancers,
E, and predicted weak enhancers, WE) due to their occurrence in
regions of open chromatin with high H3K4me1, although they differ
in the levels of marks such as H3K27ac, currently thought to
distinguish active from inactive enhancers. The other active state
(CTCF) has high CTCF binding and includes sequences that function
as insulators in a transfection assay. The remaining repressed state (R)
summarizes sequences split between different classes of actively
repressed or inactive, quiescent chromatin. We found that the
CTCF-binding-associated state is relatively invariant across cell types,
with individual regions frequently occupying the CTCF state across all
six cell types (Fig. 5c). Conversely, the E and T states have substantial
cell-specific behaviour, whereas the TSS state has a bimodal behaviour
with similar numbers of cell-invariant and cell-specific occurrences.
It is important to note that the consensus summary classes do not
capture all the detail discovered in the individual segmentations con-
taining more states.
The distribution of RNA species across segments is quite distinct,
indicating that underlying biological activities are captured in the
segmentation. Polyadenylated RNA is heavily enriched in gene
bodies. Around promoters, there are short RNA species previously
identified as promoter-associated short RNAs (Fig. 5b)16,69. Similarly,
DNA methylation shows marked distinctions between segments,
recapitulating the known biology of predominantly unmethylated
active promoters (TSS states) followed by methylated gene bodies42
(T state, Fig. 5d). The two enhancer-enriched states show distinct
patterns of DNA methylation, with the less active enhancer state
(by H3K27ac/H3K4me1 levels) showing higher methylation. These
states also have an excess of RNA elements without poly(A) tails and
methyl-cap RNA, as assayed by CAGE sequences, compared to
matched intergenic controls, indicating a specific transcriptional
mode associated with active enhancers70. Transcription factors also
showed distinct distributions across the segments (Fig. 5b). A striking
pattern is the concentration of transcription factors in the TSS-
associated state. The enhancers contain a different set of transcription
factors. For example, in K562 cells, the E state is enriched for binding
by the proteins encoded by the EP300, FOS, FOSL1, GATA2, HDAC8,
JUNB, JUND, NFE2, SMARCA4, SMARCB1, SIRT6 and TAL1 genes.
We tested a subset of these predicted enhancers in both mouse and
fish transgenic models (examples in Fig. 6), with over half of the
elements showing activity, often in the corresponding tissue type.
The segmentation provides a linear determination of functional
state across the genome, but not an association of particular distal
regions with genes. By using the variation of DNase I signal across cell
lines, 39% of E (enhancer associated) states could be linked to a
proposed regulated gene29 concordant with physical proximity
patterns determined by 5C49 or ChIA-PET.
To provide a fine-grained regional classification, we turned to a self
organizing map (SOM) to cluster genome segmentation regions based
on their assay signal characteristics (Fig. 7). The segmentation regions
were initially randomly assigned to a 1,350-state map in a two-
dimensional toroidal space (Fig. 7a). This map can be visualized as
a two-dimensional rectangular plane onto which the various signal
distributions can be plotted. For instance, the rectangle at the bottom
left of Fig. 7a shows the distribution of the genome in the initial
randomized map. The SOM was then trained using the twelve differ-
ent ChIP-seq and DNase-seq assays in the six cell types previously
analysed in the large-scale segmentations (that is, over 72-dimensional
space). After training, the SOM clustering was again visualized in two
dimensions, now showing the organized distribution of genome seg-
ments (lower right of panel, Fig. 7a). Individual data sets associated
with the genome segments in each SOM map unit (hexagonal cells)
can then be visualized in the same framework to learn how each
additional kind of data is distributed on the chromatin state map.
Figure 7b shows CAGE/TSS expression data overlaid on the randomly
initialized (left) and trained map (right) panels. In this way the trained
SOM highlighted cell-type-specific TSS clusters (bottom panels of
Fig. 7b), indicating that there are sets of tissue-specific TSSs that are
distinguished from each other by subtle combinations of ENCODE

chromatin data. Many of the ultra-fine-grained state classifications
revealed in the SOM are associated with specific gene ontology (GO)
terms (right panel of Fig. 7c). For instance, the left panel of Fig. 7c
identifies ten SOM map units enriched with genomic regions
associated with genes associated with the GO term ‘immune response’.
The centralpanelidentifies a different setof map units enrichedfor the
GO term ‘sequence-specific transcription factor activity’. The two
map units most enriched for this GO term, indicated by the darkest
green colouring, contain genes with segments that are high in
H3K27me3 in H1 hESCs, but that differ in H3K27me3 levels in
HUVECs. Gene function analysis with the GO ontology tool
(GREAT71) reveals that the map unit with high H3K27me3 levels in
both cell types is enriched in transcription factor genes with known
neuronal functions, whereas the neighbouring map unit is enriched in
genes involved in body patterning. The genome browser shots at the
bottom of Fig. 7c pick out an example region for each of the two SOM
map units illustrating the difference in H3K27me3 signal. Overall, we
have 228 distinct GO terms associated with specific segments across

increasing numbers of genes significantly associated

(centre). In each case, specific SOM units show
association with these terms. The right-hand panel
shows the distribution on the same SOM of all

transcription factor activity, two example genomic
regions are extracted at the bottom of panel c from
neighbouring SOM units. These are regions around
the DBX1 (from SOM unit 26,31, left panel) and
IRX6 (SOM unit 27,30, right panel) genes,
respectively, along with their H3K27me3 ChIP-seq
signal for each of the tier 1 and 2 cell types. For
DBX1, representative of a set of primarily neuronal
transcription factors associated with unit 26,31,
there is a repressive H3K27me3 signal in both H1
hESCs and HUVECs; for IRX6, representative of a
set of body patterning transcription factors
associated with SOM unit 27,30, the repressive mark
is restricted largely to the embryonic stem (ES) cell.

one or more states (A. Mortazavi, personal communication), and can
assign over one-thirdof genes to a GO annotation solelyon the basis of
its multicellular histone patterns. Thus, the SOM analysis provides a
fine-grained map of chromatin data across multiple cell types, which
can then be used to relate chromatin structure to other data types at
differing levels of resolution (for instance, the large cluster of units
containing any active TSS, its subclusters composed of units enriched
in TSSs active in only one cell type, or individual map units signifi-
cantly enriched for specific GO terms).
The classifications presented here are necessarily limited by the
assays and cell lines studied, and probably contain a number of
heterogeneous classes of elements. Nonetheless, robust classifications
can be made, allowing a systematic view of the human genome.
Insights into human genomic variation
We next explored the potential impact of sequence variation on
ENCODE functional elements. We examined allele-specific variation
using results from the GM12878 cells that are derived from an indi-
vidual (NA12878) sequenced in the 1000 Genomes project, along with
her parents. Because ENCODE assays are predominantly sequence-
based, the trio design allows each GM12878 data set to be divided by
the specific parental contributions at heterozygous sites, producing
aggregate haplotypic signals from multiple genomic sites. We
examined 193 ENCODE assays for allele-specific biases using
1,409,992 phased, heterozygous SNPs and 167,096 insertions/dele-
tions (indels) (Fig. 8). Alignment biases towards alleles present in
the reference genome sequence were avoided using a sequence
specifically tailored to the variants and haplotypes present in
NA12878 (a ‘personalized genome’)72. We found instances of pref-
erential binding towards each parental allele. For example, com-
parison of the results from the POLR2A, H3K79me2 and H3K27me3
assays in the region of NACC2 (Fig. 8a) shows a strong paternal bias for
H3K79me2 and POL2RA and a strong maternal bias for H3K27me3,
indicating differential activity for the maternal and paternal alleles.
Figure 8b shows the correlation of selected allele-specific signals
across the whole genome. For instance, we found a strong allelic
correlation between POL2RA and BCLAF1 binding, as well as nega-
tive correlation between H3K79me2 and H3K27me3, both at genes
(Fig. 8b, below the diagonal, bottom left) and chromosomal segments
(top right). Overall, we found that positive allelic correlations among
the 193 ENCODE assays are stronger and more frequent than nega-
tive correlations. This may be due to preferential capture of accessible
alleles and/or the specific histone modification and transcription
factor, assays used in the project.
Rare variants, individual genomes and somatic variants
We further investigated the potential functional effects of individual
variation in the context of ENCODE annotations. We divided
NA12878 variants into common and rare classes, and partitioned
these into those overlapping ENCODE annotation (Fig. 9a and
Supplementary Tables 1 and 2, section K). We also predicted potential
functional effects: for protein-coding genes, these are either non-
synonymous SNPs or variants likely to induce loss of function by
frame-shift, premature stop, or splice-site disruption; for other
regions, these are variants that overlap a transcription-factor-
binding site. We found similar numbers of potentially functional
variants affecting protein-coding genes or affecting other ENCODE
annotations, indicating that many functional variants within
individual genomes lie outside exons of protein-coding genes. A more
detailed analysis of regulatory variant annotation is described in
ref. 73.
To study further the potential effects of NA12878 genome variants
on transcription-factor-binding regions, we performed peak calling
using a constructed personal diploid genome sequence for NA12878
(ref. 72). We aligned ChIP-seq sequences from GM12878 separately
against the maternal and paternal haplotypes. As expected, a greater
fraction of reads were aligned than to the reference genome (see
Supplementary Information, Supplementary Fig. 1, section K). On
average, approximately 1% of transcription-factor-binding sites in
GM12878 cells are detected in a haplotype-specific fashion. For
instance, Fig. 9b shows a CTCF-binding site not detected using the

reference sequence that is only present on the paternal haplotype
due to a 1-bp deletion (see also Supplementary Fig. 2, section K).
As costs of DNA sequencing decrease further, optimized analysis of
ENCODE-type data should use the genome sequence of the indi-
vidual or cell being analysed when possible.
Most analyses of cancer genomes so far have focused on character-
izing somatic variants in protein-coding regions. We intersected four
available whole-genome cancer data sets with ENCODE annotations
(Fig. 9c and Supplementary Fig. 2, section L). Overall, somatic variation
is relatively depleted from ENCODE annotated regions, particularly for
elements specific to a cell type matching the putative tumour source (for
example, skin melanocytes for melanoma). Examining the mutational
spectrum of elements in introns for cases where a strand-specific
mutation assignment could be made reveals that there are mutational
spectrum differences between DHSs and unannotated regions (0.06
Fisher’s exact test, Supplementary Fig. 3, section L). The suppression
of somatic mutation is consistent with important functional roles of
these elements within tumour cells, highlighting a potential alternative
set of targets for examination in cancer.
Common variants associated with disease
In recent years, GWAS have greatly extended our knowledge of
genetic loci associated with human disease risk and other phenotypes.
The output of these studies is a series of SNPs (GWAS SNPs) corre-
lated with a phenotype, although not necessarily the functional
variants. Notably, 88% of associated SNPs are either intronic or
intergenic74. We examined 4,860 SNP–phenotype associations for
4,492 SNPs curated in the National Human Genome Research
Institute (NHGRI) GWAS catalogue74. We found that 12% of these
SNPs overlap transcription-factor-occupied regions whereas 34% over-
lap DHSs (Fig. 10a). Both figures reflect significant enrichments relative
totheoverallproportions of 1000Genomes projectSNPs(about6%and
23%, respectively). Even after accounting for biases introduced by selec-
tion of SNPs for the standard genotyping arrays, GWAS SNPs show
consistently higher overlap with ENCODE annotations (Fig. 10a, see
Supplementary Information). Furthermore, after partitioning the
genome by density of different classes of functional elements, GWAS
SNPs were consistently enriched beyond all the genotyping SNPs in
function-rich partitions, and depleted in function-poor partitions (see
Supplementary Fig. 1, section M). GWAS SNPs are particularly
enriched in the segmentation classes associated with enhancers and
TSSs across several cell types (see Supplementary Fig. 2, section M).
Examining the SOM of integrated ENCODE annotations (see
above), we found 19 SOM map units showing significant enrichment
for GWAS SNPs, including many SOM units previously associated
with specific gene functions, such as the immune response regions.

(NA12878) by both frequency (common or rare (that is, variants not present in
the low-coverage sequencing of 179 individuals in the pilot 1 European panel of
the 1000 Genomes project55)) and by ENCODE annotation, including protein-
coding gene and non-coding elements (GENCODE annotations for protein-
coding genes, pseudogenes and other ncRNAs, as well as transcription-factor-
binding sites from ChIP-seq data sets, excluding broad annotations such as
histone modifications, segmentations and RNA-seq). Annotation status is
further subdivided by predicted functional effect, being non-synonymous and

proportion of variants are annotated as having predicted functional effects in
the non-coding category. b, One of several relatively rare occurrences, where

Thus, an appreciable proportion of SNPs identified in initial GWAS
scans are either functional or lie within the length of an ENCODE
annotation (,500 bp on average) and represent plausible candidates
for the functional variant. Expanding the set of feasible functional
SNPs to those in reasonable linkage disequilibrium, up to 71% of
GWAS SNPs have a potential causative SNP overlapping a DNase I
site, and 31% of loci have a candidate SNP that overlaps a binding site
occupied by a transcription factor (see also refs 73, 75).
The GWAS catalogue provides a rich functional categorization
from the precise phenotypes being studied. These phenotypic cate-
gorizations are nonrandomly associated with ENCODE annotations
and there is marked correspondence between the phenotype and the
identity of the cell type or transcription factor used in the ENCODE
assay (Fig. 10b). For example, five SNPs associated with Crohn’s
disease overlap GATA2-binding sites (P value 0.003 by random
permutation or 0.001 by an empirical approach comparing to
the GWAS-matched SNPs; see Supplementary Information), and
fourteen are located in DHSs found in immunologically relevant cell
types. A notable example is a gene desert on chromosome 5p13.1
containing eight SNPs associated with inflammatory diseases.
Several are close to or within DHSs in T-helper type 1 (TH1) and
TH2 cells as well as peaks of binding by transcription factors in
HUVECs (Fig. 10c). The latter cell line is not immunological, but
factor occupancy detected there could be a proxy for binding of a
more relevant factor, such as GATA3, in T cells. Genetic variants in
this region also affect expression levels of PTGER4 (ref. 76), encoding
the prostaglandin receptor EP4. Thus, the ENCODE data reinforce
the hypothesis that genetic variants in 5p13.1 modulate the expression
of flanking genes, and furthermore provide the specific hypothesis
that the variants affect occupancy of a GATA factor in an allele-
specific manner, thereby influencing susceptibility to Crohn’s disease.
Nonrandom association of phenotypes with ENCODE cell types
strengthens the argument that at least some of the GWAS lead SNPs
are functional or extremely close to functional variants. Each of the
associations between a lead SNP and an ENCODE annotation
remains a credible hypothesis of a particular functional element

Figure 10 | Comparison of genome-wide-association-study-identified loci
with ENCODE data. a, Overlap of lead SNPs in the NHGRI GWAS SNP
catalogue (June 2011) with DHSs (left) or transcription-factor-binding sites
(right) as red bars compared with various control SNP sets in blue. The control
SNP sets are (from left to right): SNPs on the Illumina 2.5M chip as an example
of a widely used GWAS SNP typing panel; SNPs from the 1000 Genomes
project; SNPs extracted from 24 personal genomes (see personal genome
variants track at http://main.genome-browser.bx.psu.edu (ref. 80)), all shown
as blue bars. In addition, a further control used 1,000 randomizations from the
genotyping SNP panel, matching the SNPs with each NHGRI catalogue SNP
for allele frequency and distance to the nearest TSS (light blue bars with bounds
at 1.5 times the interquartile range). For both DHSs and transcription-factor-
binding regions, a larger proportion of overlaps with GWAS-implicated SNPs
is found compared to any of the controls sets. b, Aggregate overlap of
phenotypes to selected transcription-factor-binding sites (left matrix) or DHSs
in selected cell lines (right matrix), with a count of overlaps between the
phenotype and the cell line/factor. Values in blue squares pass an empirical
P-value threshold #0.01 (based on the same analysis of overlaps between
randomly chosen, GWAS-matched SNPs and these epigenetic features) and
have at least a count of three overlaps. The P value for the total number of
phenotype–transcription factor associations is ,0.001. c, Several SNPs
associated withCrohn’s disease andother inflammatory diseases that residein a
large gene desert on chromosome 5, along with some epigenetic features
indicative of function. The SNP (rs11742570) strongly associated to Crohn’s
disease overlaps a GATA2 transcription-factor-binding signal determined in
HUVECs. This region is also DNase I hypersensitive in HUVECs and T-helper
TH1 and TH2 cells. An interactive version of this figure is available in the online
version of the paper.

Tables 1–3, section M, list all 14,885 pairwise associations across the
ENCODE annotations. The accompanying papers have a more

information19,25,29,73,75,77.
Concluding remarks
The unprecedented number of functional elements identified in this
study provides a valuable resource to the scientific community as well
as significantly enhances our understanding of the human genome.
Our analyses have revealed many novel aspects of gene expression and
regulation as well as the organization of such information, as illu-
strated by the accompanying papers (see http://www.encodeproject.
org/ENCODE/pubs.html
for collected ENCODE publications).
However, there are still many specific details, particularly about the
mechanistic processes that generate these elements and how and
where they function, that require additional experiments to elucidate.
The large spread of coverage—from our highest resolution, most
conservative set of bases implicated in GENCODE protein-coding
gene exons (2.9%) or specific protein DNA binding (8.5%) to the
broadest, most general set of marks covering the genome (approxi-
mately 80%), with many gradations in between—presents a spectrum
of elements with different functional properties discovered by
ENCODE. A total of 99% of the known bases in the genome are within
1.7 kb of any ENCODE element, whereas 95% of bases are within 8 kb
of a bound transcription factor motif or DNase I footprint.
Interestingly, even using the most conservative estimates, the fraction
of bases likely to be involved in direct gene regulation, even though
incomplete, is significantly higher than that ascribed to protein-
coding exons (1.2%), raising the possibility that more information
in the human genome may be important for gene regulation than
for biochemical function. Many of the regulatory elements are not
constrained across mammalian evolution, which so far has been one
of the most reliable indications of an important biochemical event
for the organism. Thus, our data provide orthologous indicators for
suggesting possible functional elements.
Importantly, for the first time we have sufficient statistical power to
assess the impact of negative selection on primate-specific elements,
and all ENCODE classes display evidence of negative selection in these
unique-to-primate elements. Furthermore, even with our most conser-
vative estimate of functional elements (8.5% of putative DNA/protein
binding regions) and assuming that we have already sampled half of the
elements from our transcription factor and cell-type diversity, one
would estimate that at a minimum 20% (17% from protein binding
and2.9%proteincodinggeneexons)ofthegenomeparticipatesinthese
specific functions, with the likely figure significantly higher.
The broad coverage of ENCODE annotations enhances our under-
standing of common diseases with a genetic component, rare genetic
diseases, and cancer, as shown by our ability to link otherwise
anonymous associations to a functional element. ENCODE and
similar studies provide a first step towards interpreting the rest of
the genome—beyond protein-coding genes—thereby augmenting
common disease genetic studies with testable hypotheses. Such
information justifies performing whole-genome sequencing (rather
than exome only, 1.2% of the genome) on rare diseases and investi-
gating somatic variants in non-coding functional elements, for
instance, in cancer. Furthermore, as GWAS analyses typically asso-
ciate disease to SNPs in large regions, comparison to ENCODE non-
coding functional elements can help pinpoint putative causal variants
in addition to refinement of location by fine-mapping techniques78.
Combining ENCODE data with allele-specific information derived
from individual genome sequences provides specific insight on the
impact of a genetic variant. Indeed, we believe that a significant goal
would be to use functional data such as that derived from this project
to assign every genomic variant to its possible impact on human
phenotypes.
So far, ENCODE has sampled 119 of 1,800 known transcription fac-
tors and general components of the transcriptional machinery on a
limited number of cell types, and 13 of more than 60 currently known
histone or DNA modifications across 147 cell types. DNaseI,FAIREand
extensive RNA assays across subcellular fractionations have been under-
taken on manycelltypes, but overallthese data reflecta minor fraction of
the potential functional information encoded in the human genome. An
important future goal will be to enlarge this data set to additional factors,
modifications and cell types, complementing the other related projects
in this area (for example, Roadmap Epigenomics Project, http://
www.roadmapepigenomics.org/, and International Human Epigenome
Consortium, http://www.ihec-epigenomes.org/). These projects will
constitute foundational resources for human genomics, allowing a
deeper interpretation of the organization of gene and regulatory
information and the mechanisms of regulation, and thereby provide
important insights into human health and disease. Co-published
ENCODE-related papers can be explored online via the Nature
ENCODE explorer (http://www.nature.com/ENCODE), a specially
designed visualization tool that allows users to access the linked papers
and investigate topics that are discussed in multiple papers via them-
atically organized threads.
