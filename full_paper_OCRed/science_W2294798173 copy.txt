LIII. On Lines and lJlanes of Closest Fit to S.qstems of ]Points 
in Space. 
By KARL P~,ARSOS, F.R.S., University College, 
London *. 
(1) -]IN many physical, statistical, and biological investi- 
l_ 
gations it is desirable to represent a system of 
points in phme, three, or higher dhnensioned space by the 
" best-fits 
straight line or plane. 
Analytically this 
consists in taking 
y=ao+alx, 
or 
Z=ao+alx+b,y , 
or 
z = a o + a~xl + a2x 2 + aaxa + 9 9 9 + at, xn, 
where y, x, z, xl, x,~,.., x~ are variables, and determining the 
"best" values for the constants a0, a,, bl, a0, al, a2, as, 9 9 9 as 
in relation to the observed corresponding values of the 
variables. 
]n nearly all the cases dealt with in the text-books 
of least squares, the variables on the right of our equations 
are treated as the independent, those on the left as the de- 
pendent variables. 
The result of this treatment is that we 
get one straight line or plane if we treat some one variable as 
independent, and a quite different one if we treat another 
variable as the independent variable. 
There is no paradox 
about this ; it is, in ihct, an easily understood and most im- 
portant feature of the theory of a system of correlated 
variables. 
The most probable value of y for a given value 
of x, say, is not given by the s~me relation as the most pro- 
bable value of x tbr a given value of y. Or, to take a concrete 
example, the most probable stature of a man with a given 
length of leg I being s, the most probable length of leg for a 
man of stature s will not be I. 
The "best-fitting" lines and 
planes for the cases of z up to n variables for a correlated 
system are given in my memoir on regression t. 
They 
depend upon a determination of the means~ standard-devia- 
tions, and correlation-coefficients of the system. 
In such 
cases the values of the independent variables are supposed to 
be accurately known, and the probable value of the dependent 
variable is a~certained. 
(2) In many cases of physics and biology, however, the 
" independent" variable is subject to just as much deviation 
or error as the ~' dependent" variable. 
We do not, for 
example, know x accurately and then proceed to find y, but 
both x and y are found by experiment or observation. 
We 
observe x and y and seek tbr a unique functional relation 
between them. 
Men of given stature may have a variety

of leg-lengths; but a point at a given time will have 
one position only, although our observations of both time 
and position may be in error, and vary t'roul experiinent to 
experim0nt. 
In the case we are about to deal with, we sup- 
pose the observed variables--all subject to error--to be plotted 
in plane, three-dimensioned or higher space, and we endeavour 
to take a line (or plane) which ~vill be the "best fit" to such 
a svsteln of points. 
Of course the term " best fit" is really arbitrary; but a 
good fit will clearly be obtained if we make the sum of the 
squares of the perpendiculars fl'om the system of points upon 
the line or plane a minimum. 
For example :--Let P1, P~,.- 9 P, be the system of points 
with coordinates xl, yj ; x2, ,Y2 ;. 9 9 x, y~, and perpendicular 
distances pl, 192,... p, from a line A B. 
Then we shall make 
U=S(p ~) =a minimum. 
If y were the dependent variable, we should have made 
S (y'--y) ~ = a minimum 
(y' being the ordinate of the theoretical line at the point 
x which corresponds to y), had we wanted to determine the 
best-fitting line in the usual manner. 
8 
Now clearly U=S(p ~) is the moment of momentum, the 
second moment of the system of points, supposed equally 
loaded, about the line AB. 
But the second moment of a 
system about a series of parallel lines is always least for the

line going through the centroid. 
Hence: The best-fittlng 
straight line for a S~lStem of points in a space of any order goes 
th~'ough the cent~'oid of t],e system. 
Now let there be n points each fixed by q variables 
x b Xz... Xq, and let 
~,=S(.,)/n, 
:r~=S(.,)/n... 
~q=S(.q)/~. 
(i.)

(ii.) 
fix the sta'ndard-deviations (errors of mean square), or in- 
directly the moments of inertia or second-mom~mts about the 
axes of coordinates, through the ceutroid parallel to the axes 
of the variables xl, x~...Xq.

Now let Ii, 1.2, l a. . . lq be the generalized direction-cosines 
of a plane at perpendicular distance p from the origin.

through the centroid of tl, e system. 
Now vary (vi.) and add to it Q times the variation of (iv.),

be as small as possible. 
Substitute this value of' ~ 
in the 
type equations (viii.), and we find the required values of 
Ii, 12.. 9 lq, using (iv.). 
This is the complete analytical solution of the problem of 
drawi~,g the best-fitting plane through n non-eoplanar points. 
We see that it depends only on a knowledge of the means, 
standard-deviations, and correlations of the q variables. 
Whenever we may suppose that variation is due to errors of 
observation or measurement,--/, c., is not organic, but there 
exists a unique functional relation between the true values 
of the variables,--then, assuming it of the first degree, we may 
determine the best values of the constants in the manner given 
above. 
(3) A geometric.d interpretation is of course to be found 
from (viii.) bis. 
Consider the quadric 
O'2XlXl 2 -4- O'2~a222 --~... "4- q22~Xq 2 "~- 2a'xlo'xzrxli~,~lX ~ 
3t. . " 9 .~_ 2axq_lO.xq,rXq_lXq;Sq_lXq 
~ 
~a, 
(xi.) 
where e is any line. 
Then this quadric will be " ellipsoidal " 
since the coefficients of xl 2 ... Xq "2 are all positive quantities. 
Let R be its radius-vector measured in the direction Ii, 12 .... lq, 
or perpendicular to the plane from which we are measuring 
the residuals ; then clearly: 
U=nci/R 2, 
or 
Ex=e4/R ~ . . . . . . .  
(xii.) 
Thus the inverse square of the radius of this "ellipsoid" 
measures the square of the mean square residual. 
We shall 
speak of the ellipsoid as the ellipsoid of residuals. 
Since Z is 
to be a minimum, R must be a maximum ; or we conclude : 
that the best-fitting plane is perpendicular to the greatest axis 
of the ellipsoid of residuals and the minimum mean square 
residual varies inversely as the length of this axis. 
A case of failure can only arise if the ellipsoid of residuals 
degenerates into an " oblate spheroid," i.e., when every plane 
through its shorter axis is one of " best fit," or into a sphere, 
when every plane through the centroid of the system of points 
is an equally good fit. 
This sphericity of distribution of 
points in space involves the vanishing of all the correlations 
between the variables and the equality of all their standard- 
deviations. 
It.corresponds to isotropic inertia in the theory 
of moments in dynamics.

Sump * and differentiate to find when U=S(2r ) is a minimmn. 
We have for type equation

whence we see:

5;l--Xl' __ X2--X2 t

noted) through the centroid of the system.

Hence

plane perpendicular to the best-fitting line is perpendicular 
to the least axis of the ellipsoid of residuals. 
Thus we find : 
That the line which fits best a system of n points in q-fold space 
passes throuflh the centroid of the system and coincides in 
direction with the least axis of the ellipsoid of residuals. 
The mean square residual (which measures of course the 
closeness of the fit) is given by

where R is the least radius of the ellipsoid of residuals. 
The direction-cosines of the line can be found from (ix.) by 
giving ~2 the least value among the roots of (x.). 
Clearly the plane of best fit passes through the line of best 
fit, and is further perpendicular to the greatest radius, the 
maximmn axis of the ellipsoid of residuals. 
(5) While the geometry of lines and planes of best fit is 
thus seen to be very simple from the standpoint of inertia 
ellipsoids,--particularly from the consideration of the surface 
which, for the theory of errors, I have termed the ellipsoid of 
residuals,--they most frequently occur, perhaps, in the case 
of correlated variations or errors, and it is thus of interest to 
consider them in relation to the ellipses and ellipsoids which 
arise as " contours '" in correlation surfaces. 
Now take the case of two variables x and y only, the 
type-ellipse of the contours of the correlation surface is~ 
when referred to its centroid as origin :

Physically the axes of the correlation type-ellipse are the

Ill other words, if we define points given by (xxiii.) to be 
corresponding points,--/, e., if corresponding points lie on the 
same line at distances inversely as each other from the origins-- 
then the ends of the principal axes of the two ellipsoids ~re 
corresponding points.- Thus the principal axes of the correld- 
tion ellipsoid coincide with those of the ellipsoid of re'siduals 
in direction, and a minimum axis of the one is a maximum 
axis of the other and vice versa. 
We therefore conclude : 
(i.) That the best fitting plane to a system of points is 
perpendicular to the least axis of the correlation ellipsoid, and 
that if 2 Rmin. be th~ length of this axis the mean square 
residual = v'~ x R rain. where A is the well-known deter- 
minant of the correlation coefficients. 
(ii.) The best-fitting straight line to a system of points 
coincides in direction with the maximum axis of the correla- 
tion ellipsoid, and the mean square residual

where 2 R m~x. is the length of the maximum axis. 
We have thus the properties of the best-fitting plane and 
line in terms of the correlation ellipsoid, which is the one 
generally adopted for variation problems. At the same time 
our investigation shows us that the q directions of independent 
variation and the standard-deviations of the independent 
variables may be found from the ellipsoid of residuals~ which

Closest Fit to Systems of Points in Space.

Let us find the best-fitting plane, treating these as four 
points in three-dimensioned space. 
We have at once 
x --3, 
ff =21, 
z =209"5" 
(rx=l, 
cry= 5, 
erz-= 50"0275 
rzy~y~= 182"5~ rxzo'x~z= --30"5, 
r~(r~y----O. 
Thus the ellipsoid of residuals is: 
x ~ + 25y ~ + 2502" 75z ~ + 365gz -- 61x: = e 4. 
The equations to find the direction-cosines are : 
(2+ 2?)lx + 0. l~--61 .l~=O, 
o 
-6111+3651,+(5oo5.5+2Q)13=o. 
Whence writing 2 ~ =X (n=number of points=4) the cubic 
for X is: 
C=X 3 + 5057'5Z 2 + 123,440 X + 48~050 =0. 
We want the least root: 
x=O, C=+; X=--'5, C=--; X=-100, C= +; X=-~, 
C-----. 
Thus the required root lies between 0 and --'5. 
It is easily found to be 
Xj= -'395,660. 
Thus -- -Q ='197830, and the mean square residual 
n 
We easily deduce :

38"02187 --- 
7"35823

Thus the best-fitting plane is: 
38'02187 (x--3) --7"35823 (y--21) +z--209"5=0, 
or: 
z+38"02187x- 7"35823y--169"03778=0.. (xxv.) 
If we find the values for z for given x and y, say those of the 
four points, which are 
211"7, 135"7, 283"3, 207"3, 
we should not be impressed by the goodness of the "fit. But

the small value of the mean square residual shows how close 
to each of the points the plane really goes when we measure 
its distance from a point not by the vertical intercept, but by 
the perpendicular from the point on the plane. 
Thus the 
vertical distance fi'om x=4, y----16, z=]27, to the plane is 
8"7, but the perpendicular distance is only "1988. 
If X~ and Xa be the other two roots of the cubic C we easily 
find : 
X~Xa =1"21,44 2" 65, 
X~+Xa= --5057"1043~. 
Thus we have the quadratic to find X~ and X~ 
X ~ + 5057"10434 X + 121,442"65-- 0, 
or ." 
X~=--24"12895, X3= 45032"97445. 
%~ gives the least axis of the ellipsoid of residuals ; hence the 
direction-cosines of this axis are given by 
--'0127125 
---- '0737249 -- 1" 
We have accordingly for the equation of the best-fitting 
straight line to the four points : 
~--3 
#--~1 _ z-209"5 
(xxvi.) 
- 12"125 - 75"249

The mean square residual for this line Z I is given by (xiv.) 
V';~521J'75-- 2516"487225 
= 
3"5018. 
This again is remarkably small, considering how far our 
four points are from being co-linear. 
The reader will easily prove directly that the best line 
(xxvi.) really lies in the best plane (xxv.). 
These two illustrations may suffice to show that the methods 
of this paper can be easily applied to numerical problems; 
the labour is not largely increased if we have a considerable 
number of points. 
It becomes more cumbersome if we have 
four~ five, or more variables or characters which involve the 
determination of the least (or greatest) root (as the case may 
be) or an equation of the fourth, fil~h~ or higher order. 
Still~ the coefficients being numerical and all the roots real 
and negative, it is not very difficult to localize them.
