Abstract :  
14 
 
15 
Extracellular vesicles are a heterogeneous group of cell-derived membranous 
16 
structures that comprises exosomes and microvesicles, which originate from 
17 
the endosomal system or are shed from the plasma membrane, respectively. 
18 
They are present in biological fluids and are involved in multiple physiological 
19 
and pathological processes. Extracellular vesicles are now considered as an 
20 
additional mechanism for intercellular communication allowing cells to 
21 
exchange proteins, lipids and the genetic material. Knowledge of the cellular 
22 
processes that govern extracellular vesicle biology is essential to shed light on 
23 
physiological and pathological functions of these vesicles as well as on clinical 
24 
applications involving their use and/or analysis. Yet, many unknowns still 
25 
remain in this expanding field related to their origin, biogenesis, secretion, 
26 
targeting and fate.

35 
Apart from the release of secretory vesicles by specialized cells, which carry, 
36 
for example, hormones or neurotransmitters, all cells are capable of secreting 
37 
different types of membrane vesicles, known as extracellular vesicles, and 
38 
this process is conserved throughout evolution from bacteria to humans and 
39 
plants1 2,3. Secretion of extracellular vesicles has been initially described as 
40 
means of eliminating obsolete compounds4 from the cell. However, now we 
41 
know that extracellular vesicles are more than waste carriers, and the main 
42 
interest in the field is now focused on their capacity to exchange components 
43 
between cells — varying from nucleic acids to lipids and proteins — and to act 
44 
as signalling vehicles in normal cell homeostatic processes or as a 
45 
consequence of pathological developments5,6,7. 
46 
 
47 
Even though one generic term — extracellular vesicles – is currently in use to 
48 
refer to all these secreted membrane vesicles, they are in fact highly 
49 
heterogeneous (Fig. 1), which has largely hampered characterization and 
50 
manipulation of their properties and functions. Insights into the biogenesis of 
51 
secreted vesicles was provided by transmission and immuno-electron 
52 
microscopy, and by biochemical means 8-10 . Based on the current knowledge 
53 
of their biogenesis, extracellular vesicles can be broadly divided into two main 
54 
categories: exosomes and microvesicles (Fig 1a). 
55 
 
56 
The term exosome (which should not be confused with the exosome complex, 
57 
which is involved in RNA degradation11 ) was initially used to name vesicles of 
58 
an unknown origin released from a variety of cultured cells and carrying 5’-
59 
nucleotidase activity12. Subsequently, the term exosomes was adopted to 
60 
refer to membrane vesicles (30-100 nm in diameter) released by reticulocytes 
61 
[G] during differentiation4. In essence, exosomes are intraluminal vesicles 
62 
(ILVs) formed by the inward budding of endosomal membrane during 
63 
maturation of multivesicular endosomes (MVEs) — which are intermediates 
64 
within the endosomal system — and secreted upon fusion of MVEs with the 
65 
cell surface13,14 (Fig 1a-c). In the mid 1990’s exosomes were reported to be 
66 
secreted by B lymphocytes 15 and dendritic cells16 with potential functions 
67 
related to immune regulation, and considered for use as vehicles in anti-
68

3
tumoral immune responses. Exosome secretion is now largely extended to 
69 
many different cell types and their implications in intercellular communication 
70 
in normal and pathological states are now well documented5. 
71 
 
72 
Microvesicles, formerly called “platelet dust”, were described as subcellular 
73 
material originating from platelets in normal plasma and serum17. Later, 
74 
ectocytosis, a process allowing the release of plasma membrane vesicles, 
75 
was described in stimulated neutrophils18. Although microvesicles were mainly 
76 
studied for their role in blood coagulation19,20, more recently they were 
77 
reported to have a role in cell–cell communication in different cell types, 
78 
including cancer cells21 where they are generally called oncosomes. 
79 
Microvesicles range in size from 50-1000 nm in diameter, but can be even 
80 
larger (up to 10µm) in the case of oncosomes. They are generated by the 
81 
outward budding and fission of the plasma membrane and the subsequent 
82 
release of vesicles into the extracellular space 22 (Fig 1a-c).  
83 
 
84 
There is now evidence that each cell type tunes extracellular vesicle 
85 
biogenesis depending on its physiological state, and to release extracellular 
86 
vesicles with particular lipid, protein and nucleic acid compositions5 (Fig. 1d). 
87 
Because most published reports of extracellular vesicles have focused on 
88 
their potential functions rather their origins, it is still unclear which sub-species 
89 
of vesicles is responsible for any given effect. The current available protocols 
90 
to recover extracellular vesicles from cell culture supernatants or liquid 
91 
biopsies result in a heterogeneous population of vesicles of unknown origin 23. 
92 
Moreover, the diversity of isolated extracellular vesicle populations is further 
93 
expanded by the inclusion of additional structures into the pool of extracellular 
94 
vesicles, such as the apoptotic bodies, migrasomes, which transport 
95 
multivesicular cytoplasmic contents during cell migration24 or arrestin domain-
96 
containing protein 1-mediated microvesicles (ARMMS)25, which are largely 
97 
uniform, ~50 nm in diameter, microvesicles that have been shown to bud 
98 
directly from the plasma membrane in a manner resembling the budding of 
99 
viruses and dependent on arrestin domain-containing protein 1 (ARRDC1) 
100 
and on endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) proteins 
101 
(similarly to a sub-population of exosomes; see also below).

104 
The overlapping range of size, similar morphology and variable composition 
105 
challenge current attempts to devise a more precise nomenclature of 
106 
extracellular vesicles26 27. Nevertheless, novel isolation and characterization 
107 
methods are being developed to allow a more thorough description of 
108 
respective functions of the different types of extracellular vesicles and to 
109 
establish a suitable classification and terminology. Moreover, to validate 
110 
respective roles of exosomes and microvesicles, efforts are being made to 
111 
uncover mechanisms underlying the targeting of the different cargoes that 
112 
these vesicles transport to the site of extracellular vesicle biogenesis, the 
113 
generation and secretion of vesicles, and their fate in target cells. Here, we 
114 
review current knowledge and delineate unknown aspects of the essential 
115 
cellular processes that govern the biology of mammalian extracellular 
116 
vesicles, including their potential physiological roles, as well as their relevance 
117 
to disease and to clinical applications.

[H1] Biogenesis of extracellular vesicles  
121 
 
122 
Exosomes and microvesicles have different modes of biogenesis (but both 
123 
involve membrane trafficking processes): exosomes are generated within the 
124 
endosomal system as ILVs and secreted during fusion of MVEs with the cell 
125 
surface, whereas microvesicles originate by an outward budding at the 
126 
plasma membrane10. This nomenclature is still questionable as extracellular 
127 
vesicle biogenesis pathways may differ according to the producing cell type. 
128 
For example, T cells generate primarily extracellular vesicles from the cell 
129 
surface with characteristics of exosomes, likely exploiting at the plasma 
130 
membrane molecular components and mechanisms that are usually 
131 
associated with the endosomal biogenesis of ILVs28. This peculiar biogenesis 
132 
of exosomes from the plasma membrane might be specific to T cells, which 
133 
also use the endosomal machinery for HIV budding at the plasma 
134 
membrane29.  
135 
 
136 


----- Page 6 (native text) -----

Even though generation of microvesicles and exosomes occurs at distinct 
137 
sites within the cell, common intracellular mechanisms and sorting 
138 
machineries [G] are involved in the biogenesis of both entities. In many cases 
139 
these shared mechanisms hinder the possibility to distinguish among them5. 
140 
Mechanistic details of extracellular vesicle biogenesis have just started to be 
141 
uncovered as discussed below. First, cargoes scheduled for secretion within 
142 
extracellular vesicles must be targeted to the site of production, either at the 
143 
plasma membrane (for microvesicles) or at the limiting membrane of MVE (for 
144 
exosomes). Second, cargoes are enriched in the forming vesicles by a 
145 
stepwise mechanism of clustering and budding followed by fission and vesicle 
146 
release (Fig 2).  
147 
 
148 
[H3] Cargoes and their targeting to the site of extracellular vesicle 
149 
generation. 
150 
The nature and abundance of extracellular vesicle cargoes30 (Fig 1d) is cell 
151 
type specific and is often influenced by the physiological or pathological state 
152 
of the donor cell, the stimuli that modulate their production and release, and 
153 
the molecular mechanisms that lead to their biogenesis31. Cargoes are the 
154 
first regulators of extracellular vesicle formation. As reported for exosomes, an 
155 
ectopic expression of a particular cargo such as, for example the expression 
156 
of the major histocompatibility complex [G] (MHC) class II32 promotes MVE 
157 
formation with a consequent release of extracellular vesicles, likely by 
158 
recruiting sorting machineries that will promote MVE and ILV generation32,33.  
159 
 
160 
Exosomal membrane cargoes reach endosomes from the Golgi apparatus or 
161 
are internalized from the plasma membrane before being sorted to ILVs 
162 
during endosome maturation34 (Fig 1). Hence cargoes that are preferentially 
163 
recycled to the plasma membrane are likely not enriched in exosomes unless 
164 
their recycling is impaired, as is the case for the transferrin receptor in 
165 
reticulocytes35. Therefore, impairment or depletion of regulators of endosomal 
166 
recycling and retrograde transport from endosomes to the Golgi might 
167 
generally affect the targeting of some cargoes to extracellular vesicles. In this 
168 
context, syntenin [G] protein, by acting both in the recycling36 and in the 
169 
sorting of syndecan [G] in MVEs37 for exosome biogenesis, appears as a 
170 


----- Page 7 (native text) -----
 
6
potential regulator of the crossroad between endocytic recycling and 
171 
endosomal targeting of potential exosomal cargoes. 
172 
 
173 
Modulation of endocytosis or recycling of cargoes to the plasma membrane 
174 
would also impinge on their targeting at the site of microvesicle biogenesis. 
175 
For example, the small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) was 
176 
identified as a regulator of selective recruitment of proteins, including β1 
177 
integrin receptors, MHC class I molecules, membrane type 1-matrix 
178 
metalloproteinase 1 (MT1-MMP) and the vesicular soluble N-ethylmaleimide-
179 
sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (v-SNARE) VAMP3 into tumour-
180 
derived microvesicles38,39. In addition to ARF6-regulated endosomal 
181 
trafficking, VAMP3 mediates the trafficking and incorporation of MT1-MMP 
182 
into tumor-derived microvesicles in a CD9-dependent manner. This suggests 
183 
that VAMP3- and ARF6-positive recycling endosomes are a site of MT1-MMP 
184 
recycling to the cell surface and trafficking to microvesicles. Such crosstalk 
185 
between recycling and microvesicle biogenesis is also illustrated by studies 
186 
reporting that the small GTPase Rab22a co-localizes with budding 
187 
microvesicles and mediates packaging and loading of cargo proteins in 
188 
hypoxic breast cancer cells40.  
189 
 
190 
 
191 
[H3] Machineries involved in the biogenesis of exosomes. 
192 
Exosomes are generated as ILVs within the lumen of endosomes during their 
193 
maturation into MVEs, a process that involves particular sorting machineries. 
194 
These machineries first segregate cargoes on microdomains of the limiting 
195 
membrane of MVEs with consequent inward budding and fission of small 
196 
membrane vesicles containing sequestered cytosol (Fig 2).  
197 
 
198 
The discovery of the ESCRT machinery as a driver of membrane shaping and 
199 
scission was the first breakthrough into uncovering the mechanisms involved 
200 
in the formation of MVEs and ILVs41. ESCRT acts in a stepwise manner 
201 
where ESCRT-0 and ESCRT-I subunits cluster ubiquitinated transmembrane 
202 
cargoes on microdomains of the limiting membrane of MVEs and recruit, via 
203 
ESCRT-II, the ESCRT-III subcomplexes that perform budding and fission of 
204 


----- Page 8 (native text) -----
 
7
this microdomain (Fig 2). Accordingly, Hrs (ESCRT-0) appears to be required 
205 
for exosome formation and/or secretion by dendritic cells42.  
206 
 
207 
The role of the ESCRT machinery in ILV biogenesis and the presence of 
208 
some ESCRT subunits in exosomes opened an avenue to understand and 
209 
modulate the formation of exosomes through manipulation of the ESCRT 
210 
components. A medium-throughput RNA interference screen targeting 23 
211 
different components of ESCRT machinery and associated proteins highlights 
212 
has revealed various roles for selected members of this family in exosomes 
213 
generation. Their inactivation impacts either the efficiency of secretion or the 
214 
composition of the secreted vesicles indicating that some ESCRT 
215 
components could act selectively on MVE and ILV subpopulations fated for 
216 
secretion as exosomes43. The canonical ESCRT pathway can be intersected 
217 
by syntenin and ALIX (ALG-2 interacting protein X; an ESCRT accessory 
218 
protein; also known as PDCD6-interacting protein), which bridge cargoes and 
219 
the ESCRT-III subunit vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 32 (VPS32; 
220 
also known as CHMP4)37.  
221 
 
222 
Exosomes can be also formed in an ESCRT-independent manner, which was 
223 
revealed by studies showing that MVEs, featuring ILVs loaded with CD63 are 
224 
still formed upon depletion of components of the four ESCRT complexes44. 
225 
The first ESCRT-independent mechanism of exosome biogenesis was shown 
226 
to require generation of ceramide [G] by neutral type II sphingomyelinase that 
227 
hydrolyzes sphingomyelin [G] to ceramide45. Ceramide may then allow 
228 
generation of membrane subdomains46, which impose spontaneous negative 
229 
curvature on the membranes. Alternatively, ceramide could be metabolized to 
230 
sphingosine 1-phosphate to activate Gi-protein coupled sphingosine 1-
231 
phosphate receptor that appears essential for cargo sorting into exosomal 
232 
ILVs47 (Fig 2). In addition, proteins of the tetraspanin family [G], have been 
233 
shown to regulate the ESCRT-independent endosomal sorting. One of these 
234 
proteins is CD63, which is particularly enriched on the surface of exosomes 
235 
and has been shown to be involved in endosomal sorting in melanocytes48,49 , 
236 
in cargo (apolipoprotein E) targeting to exosomes secreted by melanoma 
237 
cells50 and in the biogenesis of exosomes in fibroblasts from down syndrome 
238

patients51. Tetraspanins CD81, CD82 and CD9 are also directly involved in 
239 
the sorting of various cargo to exosomes52,53. Mechanistically, these proteins 
240 
form clusters and dynamic membrane platforms with other testraspanins and 
241 
with different transmembrane and cytosolic proteins54 likely acting in the 
242 
formation of the microdomains that will bud. Moreover, recent structural 
243 
analysis of the tetraspanin CD81 revealed a cone-like structure with an 
244 
intramembrane cavity that can accommodate cholesterol and that is likely 
245 
shared by other tetraspanins. Clustering of several cone-shaped tetraspanins 
246 
could then induce inward budding of the microdomain in which they are 
247 
enriched55 (Fig 2). But tetraspanins also regulate the intracellular routing of 
248 
cargoes towards MVEs, such as integrins56, which indicates that impairment 
249 
of their function may affect different steps of exosome generation. Thus, it 
250 
seems that both ESCRT-dependent and -independent mechanisms operate in 
251 
exosome biogenesis, and their contribution may vary depending on the 
252 
cargoes, which recruit them, and the cell type. 
253 
 
254 
As mentioned above, sorting of transmembrane cargoes into extracellular 
255 
vesicles is largely dependent on endosomal sorting machineries. However, 
256 
additional mechanisms contribute to the targeting of selective soluble or 
257 
membrane associated cargoes to exosomes. For example, the sequestration 
258 
of cytosolic proteins into ILVs can results from co-sorting with other proteins, 
259 
such as chaperones heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and heat shock cognate 
260 
70 (HSC70), which are found in exosomes derived from most cell types57,58. 
261 
Membrane cargoes, such as GlycosylPhosphatidyInostol (GPI)-anchored 
262 
proteins [G] are present in exosomes likely because of their affinity for lipid 
263 
domains and lipid rafts [G] that could be directly involved in ILV generation 
264 
through their effects on biophysical properties of membranes59. It has also 
265 
been proposed that some cytosolic proteins, modified by ubiquitylation60 or 
266 
farnesylation61 are segregated in ILVs and in exosomes but the underlying 
267 
mechanisms for their enrichment in these compartments are still lacking. 
268 
Apart from proteins, extracellular vesicles also carry nucleic acids, including 
269 
RNAs (mRNAs and non-coding RNAs including micro RNAs (miRNAs)62,63 
270 
and DNA sequences64,65. Interestingly, miRNAs have been shown to be 
271 
differentially sorted to exosomes, depending on their sequence (presence of 
272 


----- Page 10 (native text) -----
 
9
specific motifs)66, which indicates that incorporation of nucleic acids into 
273 
exosomes is regulated . However, the relative contributions of passive and 
274 
active loading of RNAs into extracellular vesicles remain unclear67. The 
275 
mechanisms involved in targeting nucleic acids to exosomes are so far 
276 
elusive. Different machineries have been proposed to perform specific nucleic 
277 
acid sorting, including the ESCRT-II subcomplex that could act as an RNA 
278 
binding complex68, the tetraspanin-enriched microdomains that could 
279 
sequester many RNA-binding proteins in the membrane subdomains69 or the 
280 
miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC) and protein argounaute 2 
281 
(AGO2), which mediate RNA silencing processes70. New regulators of miRNA 
282 
sorting into exosomes have also recently been described and include the 
283 
KRAS–MEK signalling pathway [G] acting through AGO2 71, Major Vault 
284 
protein [G] 72 or Y-box protein 1 [G] 73.  
285 
 
286 
In sum, exosome biogenesis is certainly complex and varies depending on the 
287 
cargo and on the cell type and can be influenced by other signals and 
288 
pathological stimuli that the cell can receive. The balance of these pathways 
289 
leading to changes in the compositional repertoire of exosomes also changes 
290 
over the course of the differentiation process as reported for reticulocytes74, or 
291 
during cell maturation as shown for dendritic cells75. Accordingly, most cells 
292 
host subpopulations of MVEs distinguished by different lipid and protein 
293 
compositions and morphology52,76. In this context, different sorting 
294 
mechanisms can act on the same endosomal compartment49 or different 
295 
machineries can be used for targeting the same cargo (for example MHCII, 
296 
which can be targeted to MVEs by both ESCRT-dependent and independent 
297 
mechanisms)52,77, or on different maturation products of the cargo (as is the 
298 
case for melanocyte protein PMEL for which its luminal domain, which is 
299 
generated by proteolysis, is sorted by ESCRT-independent mechanisms, 
300 
whereas ESCRT-dependent mechanism is involved in targeting the 
301 
transmembrane domain of PMEL)49. Therefore several mechanisms could 
302 
concomitantly or sequentially act on forming MVEs, thereby allowing the 
303 
sorting of diverse cargoes at different stages of maturation of the MVE78; 
304 
alternatively or concomitantly, distinct subpopulations of MVEs may exist and 
305 
may be targeted by different machineries5,49 (Fig 3). Overall, this data support 
306 


----- Page 11 (native text) -----
 
10
a model, whereby the biogenesis of exosomes involves several distinct 
307 
mechanisms for the preferential recruitment of cargoes likely generating 
308 
heterogeneous populations of ILVs and exosomes within common or distinct 
309 
subpopulations of MVE5,6.Overall, as major regulators of the composition of 
310 
exosomes, endosomal sorting machineries appear as main determinants of 
311 
their functional properties. Therefore, agents or activities affecting early 
312 
endosomal sorting machineries and their dynamics should be considered 
313 
when investigating exosome generation and for their manipulation. 
314

317 
[H3] Machineries involved in the biogenesis of microvesicles. 
318 
Whereas blebbing from the plasma during apoptosis has long been known to 
319 
produce microvesicles in the form of apoptotic bodies79, the release of 
320 
microvesicles from the plasma membrane of healthy cells and the 
321 
mechanisms involved in this secretion have only started to emerge recently. 
322 
This biogenesis requires several molecular rearrangements within the plasma 
323 
membrane, including changes in lipid components and protein composition, 
324 
and in Ca2+ levels31. Ca2+-dependent enzymatic machineries including 
325 
aminophospholipid translocases [G] (flippases and floppases), scramblases 
326 
[G] and calpain [G] drive rearrangements in the asymmetry of membrane 
327 
phospholipids (exposition of phosphatidylserine from the inner leaflet to the 
328 
cell surface), which causes physical bending of the membrane and 
329 
restructuring of the underlying actin cytoskeleton, which favour membrane 
330 
budding and formation of microvesicles21,80 (Fig 2). A genetic defect in the 
331 
activity of the lipid scramblase suppresses the exposure of phosphatidylserine 
332 
on 
blood 
platelets, 
and 
the 
production 
of 
procoagulant-containing 
333 
microvesicles80. However, even when the membrane lipid asymmetry is 
334 
maintained, microvesicle biogenesis might proceed81,82. These observations 
335 
suggest that other lipids, and the domains they form, contribute to 
336 
microvesicle biogenesis. One important lipid component is cholesterol, which 
337 
is abundant in microvesicles and pharmacological depletion of which impairs 
338 
their generation in activated neutrophils83.  
339

In addition to lipids, cytoskeletal elements and their regulators are certainly 
341 
required for microvesicle biogenesis. The activity of Rho family of small

GTPases [G] and of the Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), which are

important regulators of actin dynamics, induce microvesicle biogenesis in 
344 
different populations of tumor cells84. As another example, in the enterocyte 
345 
brush border [G] , myosin 1a distributed along the microvillar tips exerts plus 
346 
end-directed force on the apical membrane, leading to the formation and 
347 
release of gut microvesicles85. 
348 
 
349 
The biogenesis of tumor-derived microvesicles (oncosomes) is also tightly 
350 
associated with metabolic changes, the so-called Warburg effect [G] 86. In 
351 
breast cancer cells, elevated glutaminase activity is dependent on Rho 
352 
GTPases87, and inhibition of its activity blocks microvesicle biogenesis. This 
353 
suggest that formation and loading of microvesicles is linked to their metabolic 
354 
capability and to the Rho-GTPase signalling pathway, even beyond its role in 
355 
actomyosin regulation. 
356 
 
357 
As for cargo targeting to exosomes, lipids and other membrane associated 
358 
cargoes are localized to sites of microvesicle budding through their affinity for 
359 
lipid rafts or as is the case for oligomeric cytoplasmic proteins, by their 
360 
anchoring to plasma membrane lipids88,89 — two mechanisms that are 
361 
strikingly analogous to the budding of HIV and other retroviruses. Cytosolic 
362 
components fated for secretion into microvesicles require their binding to the 
363 
inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. This association is dependent on their 
364 
respective 
plasma 
membrane 
anchors 
(palmitoylation, 
prenylation, 
365 
myristoylation) and the establishment of high-order complexes, that 
366 
concentrates them to the small membrane domains from which forming 
367 
microvesicles will bud88,89. It is still unclear how nucleic acids, which are 
368 
generally found in microvesicles, are targeted to cell surface. One possible 
369 
mechanism revealed from studies of cancer cells suggests the involvement of 
370 
conserved zipcode RNA sequence motifs [G] in the 3’ untranslated regions in 
371 
mRNA targeting into microvesicles90, but the details of this process remain to 
372 
be discovered.

[H1] The release of extracellular vesicles 
375 
Once formed, microvesicles pinch off from the plasma membrane whereas 
376 
exosome secretion requires the transport and apposition of MVEs to the 
377 
plasma membrane to fuse with and release ILVs (as exosomes) into the 
378 
extracellular milieu. The different intracellular events leading to their secretion 
379 
are likely to impose a time difference between generation and release of both 
380 
types of extracellular vesicles. Release of microvesicles would be likely faster 
381 
as cargoes only need to remain at the plasma membrane to be targeted to 
382 
microvesicles and their subsequent release would directly follow their 
383 
generation and fission. On the contrary, release of exosomes requires 
384 
additional steps to sort cargoes to MVEs, then to ILVs and extrasteps to target 
385 
MVEs to the plasma membrane and to prime them for secretion. Such 
386 
difference could be relevant from a functional point of view as it imposes 
387 
additional regulatory “checkpoints” for the secretion of exosomes as 
388 
compared to microvesicles. Whereas in some cases, such as embryonic 
389 
development, cell differentiation and in general during maintenance of 
390 
physiological homeostasis the release could be constitutive, this process may 
391 
also be subjected to further modulation by the physiological state of the cell 
392 
and the requirement for the supply of key structural components or other 
393 
mechanisms that would act as triggers for secretion such as the generation of 
394 
immunological synapse [G] 52,91. As the release of microvesicles is likely the 
395 
direct consequence of their generation and fission, in the next sections we 
396 
focus on exosome release and only summarize the few studies on potential 
397 
mechanisms that could be involved in microvesicle secretion. 
398 
 
399 
[H3] Avoiding MVE degradation. 
400 
MVEs are primarily destined to fuse with lysosomes for degradation. 
401 
However, mechanisms preventing their degradation and allowing MVE 
402 
secretion exist, thereby enabling exosome secretion (Fig 3 and 4). The 
403 
regulation of the balance between degradative and secretory capacity of 
404 
MVEs remains largely unexplored, but the setting of this balance undoubtedly 
405 
impacts on cell function. For example, lysosomal degradation defects that 
406 
promote exosome secretion have been shown to enable efficient elimination 
407 
of unwanted and/or defective proteins such as amyloids in the context of 
408 


----- Page 14 (native text) -----
 
13
neurodegenerative diseases92,93. The impairment of lysosomal activity by 
409 
inhibiting the endosomal proton pump V-ATPase also leads to an increase of 
410 
exosome release94,95, and, for example, has been shown to trigger apical 
411 
secretion of Hedgehog [G] -related peptides through a multivesicular 
412 
compartment in Caenorhabditis elegans96. 
413 
 
414 
Some insights into how the balance between targeting MVEs for secretion 
415 
and degradation is established have recently emerged. A first level of 
416 
regulation of this balance is likely imposed by the sorting machineries at 
417 
MVEs. While the different components of ESCRT machinery have various 
418 
effect on exosomes secretion23 and generally associated with degradative 
419 
MVE, the syndecan–syntenin–ALIX pathway seems to be restricted so far to 
420 
exosome secretion37. On the same line, MHCII is targeted to MVEs fated for 
421 
lysosomal degradation through ubiquitination (likely recruiting ESCRT 
422 
machinery) while ubiquitin- (and likely ESCRT-) independent mechanisms 
423 
target MHC II to MVEs fated for secretion52,77. The mechanisms underlying 
424 
this balance are still unclear but involve components of various sorting 
425 
machineries such as ESCRT-I component tumour susceptibility gene 101 
426 
protein (TSG101), whose ISGylation [G] favours lysosomal degradation (and 
427 
thereby impairment of exosome secretion)94, or the tetraspanin 697, 
428 
overexpression of which slows down lysosomal degradation likely by 
429 
recruiting sorting machinery that involves the syntenin pathway. These 
430 
findings are in accordance with the involvement of ESCRT-independent 
431 
machineries in the generation of MVEs fated for exosome secretion but not for 
432 
lysosome degradation49,52,98.  
433 
 
434 
A similar balance exists between exosome secretion and macroautophagy — 
435 
the process that drives degradation of superfluous or damaged cellular 
436 
components in the lysosome to maintain cellular homeostasis and that 
437 
promotes energy conservation under stress. More specifically, the fusion of 
438 
MVEs with autophagosome would promote their degradation and prevent 
439 
exosome secretion99 (Fig 4). In this context, it has been shown that the prion 
440 
protein (PrP) can promote exosome secretion by inhibiting autophagosome 
441 
formation and it does so by interacting with caveolin [G] and modulating its 
442 


----- Page 15 (native text) -----
 
14
inhibitory effect on autophagosome formation100. Of interest, chemical 
443 
inhibition of autophagy increases the recovery of autophagosome-associated 
444 
proteins in the isolated exosomal pellet but not of exosome-enriched 
445 
proteins101. This suggests that the capacity of MVEs to secrete exosomes is 
446 
counter-balanced 
by 
their 
fusion 
with 
the 
autophagosome. 
Yet, 
447 
autophagosomes and MVEs can both secrete their content but the molecular 
448 
mechanisms regulating these secretory pathways are likely distinct.  
449 
 
450 
[H3] Transport of MVEs.  
451 
As discussed above, MVEs fuse either with lysosomes for degradation of their 
452 
content or with the plasma membrane. In both cases a two-step process 
453 
involving their transport (motility) and fusion is required, but the effectors 
454 
involved in targeting MVEs to the lysosomes or to the plasma membrane are 
455 
certainly distinct.  
456 
 
457 
In general, intracellular transport involves the association of organelles with 
458 
the cell cytoskeleton (actin, microtubules), associated molecular motors 
459 
(dynein, kinesins, myosins) and molecular switches (Small GTPases)102 ,103.  
460 
Exosome secretion is provided by the oriented secretion of these vesicles 
461 
towards the immunological synapse between antigen-presenting cells and T 
462 
cells during antigen presentation52,104. This implies that at least in the context 
463 
of immunological synapse MVEs follow the network of microtubules oriented 
464 
by the microtubule organizing centre (typically the centrosome)91 (Fig 4). The 
465 
molecular motors involved in this process remain to be determined but 
466 
certainly counterbalance those that regulate transport of MVEs towards 
467 
lysosomes. Targeting to lysosomes occurs by a retrograde transport on 
468 
microtubules (towards microtubule minus ends), and Rab-GTPase Rab7 and 
469 
its associated proteins promote the recruitment of the retrograde molecular 
470 
motor dynein that targets MVE to lysosomes105. Interestingly, Rab7 is also 
471 
mandatory for the release of exosomes37. These dual effect on exosome 
472 
secretion seems to rely on the ubiquitylation status of Rab7, which has been 
473 
shown to promote the recruitment of the machinery involved in lysosomal 
474 
targeting of MVEs at the expense of exosome secretion106. Curiously, in 
475 
endosomes the recruitment of Rab7 leading to lysosomal targeting is 
476 


----- Page 16 (native text) -----
 
15
stimulated by cholesterol at their limiting membrane, whereas MVE-containing 
477 
ILVs enriched in cholesterol have been shown to undergo preferential 
478 
secretion as exosomes107. Thus, dynamic changes in the composition of the 
479 
limiting membrane of MVEs, through incorporation of specific lipids and 
480 
proteins into ILVs, would likely regulate the fate of MVEs towards degradation 
481 
or secretion. 
482 
 
483 
Rab27a and Rab27b32 and their respective effectors, synaptotagmin-like 
484 
protein 4 and exophilin 5, are also essential for exosome secretion. Rab27b 
485 
regulates the motility of MVEs towards the plasma membrane, and both 
486 
Rab27 isoforms act on the step following MVE transport, that is the docking at 
487 
the plasma membrane to promote fusion, thereby increasing exosome 
488 
secretion. The role of Rab27a in MVE docking involves rearrangement of sub-
489 
membrane actin cytoskeleton108, a step that is common to all mechanisms 
490 
involving vesicular secretion. Rab27 also controls secretion of secretory 
491 
lysosomes so called lysosome related organelles109, which suggests that 
492 
MVEs capable of exosome secretion may be considered as a specialized 
493 
compartment rather than a simple MVE subtype. Of note, Rab27 isoforms are 
494 
not constitutively expressed in all cell types, which implies that each cell type 
495 
may adapt its own secretory machineries for exosome secretion. This is 
496 
illustrated by reported involvement of additional Rabs and their effectors, such 
497 
as Rab11 and Rab35 effector110,111 in the direct regulation or the potential 
498 
priming of MVE secretion.  
499 
 
500 
[H3] Fusion of MVEs with the plasma membrane.  
501 
The final step of exosome secretion requires the fusion of MVEs with the 
502 
plasma membrane to release ILVs as exosomes (Fig 4), a process likely 
503 
mediated by SNARE proteins [G] and synaptotagmin family [G] members112. 
504 
A SNARE complex known to be implicated in the exocytosis of conventional 
505 
lysosomes consists of VAMP7 on the lysosomes, syntaxin 7 on the plasma 
506 
membrane and the lysosomal regulatory protein synaptotagmin 7113. This 
507 
complex is involved in exosome secretion in some cells (human leukemia 
508 
K562 cell line)114 but not in others (MDCK cells)115. The process of exosome 
509 
secretion has been demonstrated in several cell types to be regulated by Ca2+ 
510 


----- Page 17 (native text) -----
 
16
116-118, which may have a role in the activation of the SNARE complexes. The 
511 
implication of SNAP23 — a SNARE shown to regulate lysosome-related 
512 
organelles secretion in mastocytes119 — also in exosome secretion120, 
513 
strengthens the notion that MVEs are indeed specialized secretory organelles. 
514 
Additional SNARE proteins involved in exosome secretion such as YkT6 121 in 
515 
Drosophila, SYX-5 in C. elegans 122 and syntaxin 1a 123 in mammals reflect 
516 
again the diversity of regulators that could be involved in exosome secretion, 
517 
most likely depending on the organism, the cell type or the MVE subtypes. It 
518 
should be noted that most of the studies on the intracellular regulators of 
519 
exosome release came from analysis of exosomal pellets isolated from 
520 
supernatants from cell cultures treated with inhibitors or interfering RNAs 
521 
against potential targets, ignoring the complexity of intracellular pathways that 
522 
might be affected in the producing cells by these perturbations. Moreover, the 
523 
quantity of extracellular vesicles recovered in the supernatant does not take 
524 
into account the fraction of vesicles that remains tethered (not fully released) 
525 
at the plasma membrane of the producing cells95 or the fraction of 
526 
extracellular vesicles that can be recaptured by the same cell124. A better 
527 
understanding of this step certainly requires the development of new tools and 
528 
techniques to follow docking and fusion of MVEs with the plasma membrane.  
529 
 
530 
[H3] Release of microvesicles. 
531 
The release of microvesicles requires their fission from the plasma 
532 
membrane, a mechanism that is dependent on the interaction of actin and 
533 
myosin with a subsequent ATP-dependent contraction85,125. As such, the 
534 
activation of small GTP binding proteins including ARF6 and ARF1 leads to 
535 
the phosphorylation of the myosin light chain (MLC) and actomyosin 
536 
contraction, which allows the vesicles to bud off from the membranes of 
537 
cancer cells39 126 127. In HeLa cells another regulator of actin dynamics, Cdc42 
538 
has been shown to be involved, but the underlying mechanism is still not 
539 
known84. Interestingly, TSG101 and VPS4-ATPase, mostly involved in 
540 
exosomes generation as part of the ESCRT machinery, were reported to 
541 
participate in the scission and release of ARMMs (subtype of microvesicles 
542 
containing ARRDC1)25. Shedding of ESCRT-dependent microvesicles was 
543 
also reported in C. elegans embryos upon loss of the conserved flippase P4-
544 


----- Page 18 (native text) -----
 
17
ATPase, 
TAT-5, 
which 
leads 
to 
the 
cytosolic 
exposure 
of 
545 
phosphatidylethanolamine, an aminophospholipid asymmetrically enriched in 
546 
the inner leaflet of the membrane bilayer128. This scenario mirrors the 
547 
exposure of phosphatidylserine by lipid translocation, which as discussed 
548 
above, can promote membrane bending and microvesicle budding. (Fig 2) 
549 
 
550 
The involvement of cell signalling pathways in microvesicle release is strongly 
551 
supported by reports showing that removal of serum, and therefore growth 
552 
factors acting on their respective receptors and downstream effectors, 
553 
prevents microvesicle release129. What is known is that a strong microvesicle 
554 
release is induced by increased concentration of Ca2+, which by activating 
555 
scramblase and calpain leads to a loss of membrane phospholipid asymmetry 
556 
and the reorganization of the cytoskeleton (see above) or by the activation of 
557 
protein kinase C [G] by phorbol esters130. Release of microvesicles has also 
558 
been shown to depend on ATP-mediated activation of P2x7 receptors [G] , 
559 
which leads to rearrangements of the cell membrane131,132. Mechanistically, 
560 
this 
process 
is 
associated 
with 
the 
translocation 
of 
the 
acidic 
561 
sphingomyelinase to the plasma membrane where it generates ceramide, 
562 
thereby promoting membrane bending and microvesicle shedding133. The 
563 
involvement of acidic rather than neutral sphingomyelinase in microvesicle 
564 
release suggests that different members of the sphingomyelinase family 
565 
control the biogenesis of exosomes45 (see above) and the release of 
566 
microvesicles, but in both cases, these mechanisms would support ESCRT -
567 
independent vesicle release. 
568 
 
569 
[H1] Targeting to recipient cells  
570 
Once released into the extracellular space extracellular vesicles can reach 
571 
recipient cells and deliver their content to elicit functional responses and 
572 
promote phenotypical changes that will impact on their physiological or 
573 
pathological status. Extracellular vesicle-mediated intercellular communication 
574 
requires docking at the plasma membrane, followed by the activation of 
575 
surface receptors and signalling, vesicle internalization (endocytosis) or their 
576 
fusion with target cells (Fig 5). The mode of vesicle interaction with the cell 
577 
surface and the mechanisms that mediate the transfer of extracellular vesicle 
578 


----- Page 19 (native text) -----
 
18
cargoes are not fully unravelled. These processes are complex and depend 
579 
on the origin of extracellular vesicles and on the identity and origin of the 
580 
recipient cells, as well as seem to be linked to the downstream effects and 
581 
processes instigated by these vesicles134. Current studies have been mostly 
582 
focused on investigating membrane interaction and intercellular fate of pools 
583 
of exosomes, but despite different content and size, the principles of uptake 
584 
and general intercellular trafficking of different sub-populations of extracellular 
585 
vesicle are likely to be shared.  
586 
 
587 
[H3] Binding of extracellular vesicles to their target cells.  
588 
Target cell specificity is likely to be determined by specific interactions 
589 
between proteins enriched at the surface of extracellular vesicles and 
590 
receptors at the plasma membrane of the recipient cells, as for example, in 
591 
follicular dendritic cells [G] 135,intestinal epithelial cell136, dendritic cells137, or 
592 
neurons 138, and also in liver, lungs or lymph nodes136,139. Of note, the 
593 
recipient cells can also be the producing cell itself, leading to autocrine 
594 
responses124. 
595 
 
596 
Several mediators [Au:OK?] OK of these interactions are known and include 
597 
tetraspanins, integrins, lipids, lectin [G] or heparan sulfate proteoglycans [G], 
598 
and extracellular matrix (ECM) components (Fig 5 inset). The cellular and 
599 
molecular basis for the specific targeting to acceptor cells is still unclear, 
600 
although some data is available. For example, integrins on extracellular 
601 
vesicles can interact with adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion 
602 
molecules [G] (ICAMs)140 at the surface of recipient cells. In addition, the 
603 
interaction of integrins with extracellular matrix proteins, mostly fibronectin 
604 
and laminin, has been shown to have important roles in exosome141,142 and 
605 
microvesicle 143 binding to recipient cells. In this context, the ECM can act as a 
606 
“zipper” between integrins present on extracellular vesicles and target cells. In 
607 
vivo, integrin heterodimers may drive extracellular vesicles towards specific 
608 
target organs139. One example includes exosomes released by cancer cells, 
609 
which can be targeted to specific organs such as lung and liver, to promote 
610 
premetastatic niche formation in a manner dependent on their integrin 
611 


----- Page 20 (native text) -----
 
19
composition139. Exosomal tetraspanins could also regulate cell targeting. They 
612 
have been shown to interact with integrins144 and to promote exosome 
613 
docking and uptake by selected recipient cells145,146. Other molecules such as 
614 
heparan sulphate proteoglycan and lectins, both present in extracellular 
615 
vesicles and at the plasma membrane, contribute to their docking and/or 
616 
attachment of these vesicles to recipient cells (Fig 5). Glypican-1, a cell 
617 
surface proteoglycan that bears heparan sulfate, and CD44, a cell-surface 
618 
glycoprotein involved in cell–cell interactions, are involved in exosome147 and 
619 
microvesicle148 docking, respectively. The lipid composition of extracellular 
620 
vesicles can also have an impact on recipient-cell targeting. For example, 
621 
phosphatidylserine can recruit specific lipid-binding proteins such as Galectin 
622 
5 or Annexin 5140 149,150 that then induce docking of vesicles to the target cell 
623 
membrane.  
624 
 
625 
[H3] Uptake and intracellular fate of extracellular vesicles.  
626 
Once they have bound to recipient cells extracellular vesicles may remain at 
627 
the plasma membrane 135; 52 or may be internalized by clathrin-mediated or 
628 
clathrin-independent endocytosis, such as macropinocytosis [G] and 
629 
phagocytosis151-153 as well as through endocytosis via caveolae and lipid 
630 
rafts157-159 (Fig 5 ). Of note, certain cell types, such as HeLa cells or EBV-
631 
transformed B cell line release clusters of exosomes, as a result of tethering 
632 
the vesicles by protein tetherin95. This clustering may affect the way these 
633 
vesicles are internalized, favouring phagocytosis or macropinocytosis to 
634 
support the engulfment of such large masses or aggregates of extracellular 
635 
vesicles151.  
636 
 
637 
Specific composition of extracellular vesicles will influence their fate. The 
638 
presence of Amyloid precursor protein on one exosome subtype from 
639 
neuroblastoma cells will specifically target them to neurons contrary to a 
640 
CD63 enriched exosome subtype that binds both neurons and glial cells154. 
641 
Another example is the presence of syncitin at the surface of exosomes 
642 
derived from the trophoblast [G] that promotes their uptake 155, whereas the 
643 
presence of a “don’t eat me” signal , such as CD47, at the surface has been 
644 


----- Page 21 (native text) -----
 
20
shown to have a strong inhibitory effect on vesicle phagocytosis by 
645 
monocytes 156.  
646 
 
647 
The fate of extracellular vesicles is also likely related to the presence of 
648 
specific structures at the plasma membrane of the target cell. As an illustrative 
649 
example, it has been shown that microvesicles derived from microglia [G] 
650 
show largely different dynamics of interaction with membranes of microglia 
651 
and astrocytes [G] 157. It has also been shown that filopodia [G] drive 
652 
extracellular vesicles toward sites of uptake158. The lipid composition of the 
653 
plasma membrane of recipient cells such as the presence of lipid raft also 
654 
contributes to extracellular vesicle internalization as disruption of lipid rafts by 
655 
cholesterol depletion reduces uptake of extracellular vesicles159.  
656 
 
657 
Following interaction with the plasma membrane of recipients cells157 and after 
658 
uptake by different mechanisms, extracellular vesicles follow the endocytic 
659 
pathway and reach MVEs, which in most cases, are targeted to the 
660 
lysosome160,161. In some cases the internalized vesicles may escape digestion 
661 
by back fusion with the limiting membrane of the MVE, thereby releasing their 
662 
content into the cytoplasm of the recipient cell162, a process that is still poorly 
663 
understood but of prime importance to release intraluminal nucleic acid 
664 
structures (Fig 5). The restricted co-localization of trophoblast-derived 
665 
exosomes with early but not late endosomal structures also suggests that 
666 
some internalized extracellular vesicles could escape lysosomal degradation 
667 
by being re-secreted either via the early endocytic recycling pathway or by 
668 
fusion of MVEs with the plasma membrane (Fig 5) 155.  
669 
 
670 
Advances in live imaging methods and super-resolution techniques will surely 
671 
aid in providing further understanding of the processes of extracellular vesicle 
672 
uptake and their intracellular fates.  
673 
 
674 
[H3] Signals delivered by extracellular vesicles to recipient cells.  
675 
Once docked at the plasma membrane, extracellular vesicles can elicit 
676 
functional responses by binding to and activating receptors expressed on the 
677 
recipient cells (Fig 5). First examples were B cells and dendritic cells derived 
678 


----- Page 22 (native text) -----
 
21
exosomes that were able to present antigen to T cells and induce specific 
679 
antigenic response15,16. Tumour derived microvesicles were shown to carry 
680 
fibronectin, which when bound to integrin on non-transformed fibroblasts was 
681 
able to promote their anchorage independent growth (one of the hallmarks of 
682 
tumorigenesis), contributing to the acquisition of transformed phenotype by 
683 
healthy cells163. As another example, microvesicles generated and released 
684 
by embryonic stem cells were shown to induce invasion of maternal tissue by 
685 
the trophoblast, which is mediated by the interaction of laminin and fibronectin 
686 
on the microvesicles with integrins along the surfaces of the trophoblast, and 
687 
which promotes embryo implantation164. The role of extracellular vesicles in 
688 
the long-range transfer of morphogens to recipient cells in developing 
689 
organisms was also shown165. 
690 
 
691 
Cargo delivered by extracellular vesicles can also activate various responses 
692 
and processes in the recipient cell after internalization. For example, in 
693 
dendritic cells, protein cargo of exosomes derived from intestinal epithelial 
694 
cells136 or other dendritic cells140 is processed in the endocytic compartment 
695 
similarly to antigens and then used in antigen presentation, thereby 
696 
contributing to immune response regulation. Extracellular vesicles could also 
697 
fuse directly with the plasma membrane or with the endocytic membrane of 
698 
recipients cells. Such processes are mandatory to release intraluminal content 
699 
in the cytoplasm of recipient cells, a key step to support the release of 
700 
miRNA62 and mRNA166 from extracellular vesicles into recipient cells to 
701 
regulate gene expression. Direct fusion of extracellular vesicles with the 
702 
membrane of recipients cells allow also the exchange of transmembrane 
703 
proteins and lipids. Extracellular vesicles can transport various lipid species 
704 
including eicosanoids, fatty acids, and cholesterol as well as lipid 
705 
translocases, thereby contributing to the regulation of bioactive lipid 
706 
species167. Under pathological situations, a good example of material 
707 
transferred through extracellular vesicles is given by pathological amyloid 
708 
proteins, which can be either enriched at the surface of extracellular vesicles 
709 
such as prion protein or amyloid beta peptide, or present intraluminaly such 
710 
as TDP43 and alpha-synuclein. Their transfer to recipient cells, requiring back 
711 
fusion, has been proposed to favour transcellular spreading of amyloids168. 
712

22
Mechanisms governing fusion of extracellular vesicles with these different 
713 
compartments are not known yet, but could be analogous to fusogenic 
714 
processes employed by viruses169.  
715 
 
716 
The ultimate and likely most frequent fate of extracellular vesicles is their 
717 
targeting to lysosomes, which leads to the degradation of proteins and lipids 
718 
carried by extracellular vesicles. Of importance this degradative pathway 
719 
would provide a relevant source of metabolites to the recipient cells170 (Fig 5). 
720 
 
721 
[H1] Conclusions and perspectives 
722 
Much progress has been made in recent years in understanding the basic 
723 
biology of extracellular vesicles, but further investigations are required to fully 
724 
resolve the functional capabilities of these vesicles. Extracellular vesicles are 
725 
involved in several physiological contexts and pathological states, including 
726 
blood 
coagulation, 
inflammation, 
stem 
cell 
expansion, 
neuronal 
727 
communication and tumorigenesis among others6. In this context, extracellular 
728 
vesicles have been shown to carry, for example, tumour-associated 
729 
molecules in case of cancer and premetastatic niche establishment139 171, or 
730 
particular components associated with neudegenerative diseases172. Thus, 
731 
extracellular vesicles hold a great potential for clinical application. 
732 
 
733 
 Regulatory pathways involved in biogenesis and secretion of extracellular 
734 
vesicles, when well defined, could be used to manipulate extracellular vesicle 
735 
generation in pathological states, such as tumorigenesis, where the 
736 
involvement of extracellular vesicles in pathology has been particularly well 
737 
documented163. Nevertheless, it should be noted that manipulation of 
738 
machineries involved in the biogenesis, transport or targeting of extracellular 
739 
vesicles for therapeutic benefit should be approached with caution, owing to 
740 
potential secondary effects of such manipulations on healthy tissues173. 
741 
 
742 
The broad and increasing interest in extracellular vesicles has also opened up 
743 
the possibility to use exosomes and microvesicles as biomarkers to follow 
744 
progression of various pathological states, for example for assessing risk of 
745 
tumour progression and metastasis or for providing early biomarker of 
746 


----- Page 24 (native text) -----
 
23
neurodegenerative diseases172. Investigations in this area have flourished, 
747 
aiming to put on solid ground the use of extracellular vesicles as biomarkers 
748 
in a variety of diseases. Developing techniques to enrich for disease-
749 
associated (for example, tumour-derived) extracellular vesicles to define their 
750 
selective cargo can improve the sensitivity of such biomarkers174. Whether 
751 
these “membrane biomarkers” correspond to endosomal-derived exosomes or 
752 
membrane-derived microvesicles is so far unclear although potentially 
753 
informative. Future studies and optimized isolation procedures (Box 1) will 
754 
shed light on the nature of the different extracellular vesicle subpopulations 
755 
that could be associated with distinct pathological states and stages of 
756 
progression of a given disease.  
757 
 
758 
Another emerging application is the use of microvesicles and exosomes as 
759 
vectors for the delivery of defined compounds or more generally for 
760 
modulation of cell functions in an in vivo context. Extracellular vesicles are 
761 
biocompatible, can be immunologically inert, and can, if necessary, be 
762 
patient-derived and therefore with lower propensity to trigger innate and 
763 
adaptive immune responses 175. Their use in clinical research have already 
764 
demonstrated that extracellular vesicles secreted by immune cells (dendritic 
765 
cells) stimulate the immune system and can therefore be exploited as anti-
766 
tumor vaccines176,177. Several clinical trials involving the use of extracellular 
767 
vesicle-based delivery are ongoing, for example for the treatment of lung 
768 
cancer and melanoma, that may become part of an immunotherapy approach 
769 
that has great potential for patients with advanced cancers178. Given that 
770 
extracellular 
vesicles 
(in 
particular 
 
exosomes) 
can 
be 
either 
771 
immunostimulatory or  tolerogenic (immunologically inert), there are several 
772 
examples of possible therapeutical interventions where extracellular vesicles 
773 
can be used (reviewed in detail elsewhere5,179,172). Beside the aforementioned 
774 
use of extracellular vesicles in antitumoral therapy, dendritic cells pulsed with 
775 
Toxoplasma gondii release extracellular vesicles that confer protection 
776 
against subsequent toxoplasma infection180. Such strategy could be 
777 
considered for fungi, bacteria, parasitic protozoa and helminths172. 
778 
Mesenchymal stem cells-dreived extracellular vesicles are now tested in 
779 
animal models to treat acute kidney failure181, myocardial infarction182 or 
780 


----- Page 25 (native text) -----
 
24
ischemia183. Other undergoing assays are based on in vitro manipulation of 
781 
extracellular vesicles with the loading of a particular cargo (for example 
782 
interfering RNAs; suicide mRNA/protein [G] , miRNAs, drugs) to then deliver it 
783 
to the target cell as a drug or for bioengineering purposes184,185. Modulating 
784 
the specificity of targeting extracellular vesicles to recipient cells will be key for 
785 
their use as high precision vehicles, and such approaches have already been 
786 
tested to optimize the delivery of siRNAs to the brain184. 
787 
 
788 
Despite the enormous therapeutical potential, the field is still in demand of 
789 
new in vivo models combined with powerful imaging methods to track at the 
790 
single vesicle scale, the release, trafficking routes and fates of extracellular 
791 
vesicles within the complex architecture of the organism (see also Box 1). Cell 
792 
biologists and physicians working side by side in a complementary manner 
793 
will certainly shed further light on the basic functions of extracellular vesicles 
794 
and on their translation from the bench to bedside.

Methods of isolation and analysis of extracellular vesicles. 
1354 
 
1355 
The release of extracellular vesicles in the extracellular space allows their 
1356 
recovery from cell culture supernatants and liquid biopsies. Isolation 
1357 
procedures include differential ultracentrifugation, flotation on density 
1358 
gradient, separation by size exclusion chromatography, poly(ethylene glycol) 
1359 
(PEG) precipitation, immunoprecipitation and commercial kits that are partly 
1360 
based on these methods. These steps allow to concentrate and to separate 
1361 
extracellular vesicles from protein aggregates, lipoparticles, viruses, and cell 
1362 
debris with different rates of success. Combination of different isolation 
1363 
procedures is encouraged to notably separate subpopulations of vesicles 
1364 
based on their size, density or composition.  
1365 
 
1366 
Several analytical methods are available and should be combined to first 
1367 
assess purity, integrity and concentration of extracellular vesicles before 
1368 
further analysis or other experiments. The most commonly used approaches 
1369 
for the analysis of the composition and morphology of extracellular vesicle 
1370 
populations include western-blot analysis, nano-particle tracking, transmission 
1371 
electron microscopy and flow cytometry and can be completed by proteomics, 
1372 
lipidomics and RNA and/or DNA sequencing67,186. Functional analysis of 
1373 
extracellular vesicles depends on the question to be addressed. It should 
1374 
always be performed after assessment of the purity of the extracellular vesicle 
1375 
pellet, as soluble proteins such as cytokines, protein complexes and 
1376 
aggregates or lipoparticles are a major source of false positive results in 
1377 
functional assays.  
1378

A crowdsourcing knowledgebase (http://evtrack.org) that centralizes 
1380 
extracellular vesicle studies and methodologies provide a means to 
1381 
standardize extracellular vesicle research to strengthen reproducibility 
1382 
between studies187. Emerging strategies are now developed to investigate 
1383 
biogenesis, uptake of extracellular vesicles and the transfer of material to 
1384 
recipient cells in vitro and in vivo. These strategies are mainly based on the 
1385 


----- Page 36 (native text) -----
 
35
labelling of isolated extracellular vesicles with fluorescent dyes or expression 
1386 
of fluorescent reporters that are targeted to these vesicles. Such labelling has 
1387 
some limitations188 but allows the tracking of extracellular vesicle by live cell 
1388 
imaging in cell lines and, to limited extent, also in vivo189. The main limitation 
1389 
being the size of the vesicles, super-resolution microscopy is one option to 
1390 
assess vesicle budding at the plasma membrane or in multivesicular 
1391 
endosomes, and to track their fate in recipient cells. A second approach is 
1392 
based on the loading of extracellular vesicles with molecules (mRNA, micro 
1393 
RNA, Cre recombinase)190,191 which induce detectable signals such as 
1394 
modulation of expression of a reporter gene once released in recipient cells. 
1395 
Alternative approach using optical tweezers allows the manipulation and the 
1396 
visualization of single vesicle at the surface of recipient cells157. But, so far, 
1397 
the field is still in demand of in vivo models that would allow reproducible 
1398 
tracking of extracellular vesicles at a single vesicle and high spatio-temporal 
1399 
resolution at different stages: through their biogenesis and transit routes in 
1400 
secreting cells to their delivery and fate in the recipient cells. Such approach 
1401 
would overcome the actual limitations linked to, for example, the biased 
1402 
recovery of extracellular vesicles from the supernatant (resulting from 
1403 
processes such as vesicle tethering to the membrane of the producing cell or 
1404 
their re-uptake)95,124. But as in any novel field of research, pre-analytical and 
1405 
analytical methods for studying extracellular vesicles are bound to evolve and 
1406 
to be better standardized to render the increasing numbers of publications in 
1407 
this field comparable.

Figure 1: Main features of extracellular vesicles.  
1411 
(a) Extracellular vesicles comprise a heterogeneous population of membrane 
1412 
vesicles of various origins. Their size may vary (typically between 50 to 500 
1413 
nm but they can be even larger measuring 1-10 um). Through the last two 
1414 
decades, extracellular vesicle have been denominated according to their 
1415 
origin (cell type), size, morphology and cargo content but can now be 
1416 
classified into two distinct classes: exosomes and microvesicles. (b) 
1417 
Extracellular vesicles are formed either by budding of the plasma membrane, 
1418 


----- Page 37 (native text) -----
 
36
and are referred to as microvesicles or as intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) within 
1419 
the lumen of multivesicular endosomes (MVEs). MVEs fuse with the plasma 
1420 
membrane to release ILVs that are then called exosomes. (c) Processing of 
1421 
extracellular vesicles for observation by conventional transmission electron 
1422 
microscopy (TEM) causes their shrinking leading to an artefactual cup-shaped 
1423 
morphology (top panel). But when observed in close to native state by cryo 
1424 
electron microscopy (cryo-EM) they appear as round shaped double-leaflet-
1425 
membrane enclosed structures (bottom panel). (d) Study of extracellular 
1426 
vesicle composition revealed that they can carry versatile cargoes, including 
1427 
proteins, lipid and nucleic acids and this content can largely vary between 
1428 
cells and conditions. The particular composition will directly affect the fate and 
1429 
function of extracellular vesicles, strengthening the importance of selective 
1430 
cargo sorting mechanisms. Of note, according to the cell type extracellular 
1431 
vesicles will display a set of cell type specific proteins that account for their 
1432 
specific fates and functions. Despite a different mode of biogenesis, 
1433 
exosomes and microvesicles display similar appearance, overlapping size 
1434 
and often common composition that make it difficult to ascertain their origin

Figure 2: Biogenesis of extracellular vesicles  
1452 
Several sorting machineries are involved in the different steps required for 
1453 
exosomes and microvesicles generation. First, lipids and membrane-
1454 
associated proteins are clustered in discrete membrane microdomains of the 
1455 
plasma membrane for microvesicles (top) and the limiting membrane of the 
1456 
multivesicular endosome (MVE) for exosomes (bottom) (step 1). Such 
1457 
microdomains certainly also participate in the recruitment of soluble 
1458 
components fated for sorting in extracellular vesicles such as cytosolic 
1459 
proteins and RNA species (step 2). Altogether formation of these clustered 
1460 
microdomains together with additional machineries promote membrane 
1461 
budding followed by a fission process either at the plasma membrane towards 
1462 
the extracellular medium or at the limiting membrane of the MVE towards the 
1463 
lumen of MVE (step 3). Transmembrane proteins sorted on exosomes and 
1464 
microvesicles keep the same topology as at the plasma membrane. 
1465 
Mechanisms of exosome biogenesis are relatively well understood and 
1466 
importantly involve subunits of endosomal sorting complex required for 
1467 
transport (ESCRT), although to a different degree — ESCRT-III is required for 
1468 
the scission of the intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) into the MVE lumen, but 
1469 
membrane budding can occur by either ESCRT-dependent or ESCRT-
1470 
independent mechanisms. The mechanisms involved in the biogenesis of 
1471 
microvesicles is still expanding. Notably, the molecular machineries that act at 
1472 
the different steps of extracellular vesicle biogenesis are at least partly 
1473 
common to exosomes and microvesicles (prominently including ESCRT 
1474 
proteins but also generation of ceramide through the action of different types 
1475 
of sphingomyelinase). One exception is the flipping of specific lipid species 
1476 
between the leaflets of the budding membrane that has been uniquely 
1477 
reported so far to microvesicle budding. Thus, it is difficult to ascertain the 
1478 
origin of the produced extracellular vesicle by simply impairing the function of 
1479 
a given mechanism involved in biogenesis of these vesicles. ARF6, ADP-

Figure 3: Origin of exosome diversity in relation to sorting machineries.  
1483 
The diversity of extracellular vesicle sub-populations with distinct composition 
1484 
and function that are generated by a given cell type is often attributed to the 
1485 


----- Page 39 (native text) -----
 
38
production of distinct sets of exosomes and microvesicles23,192. This diversity 
1486 
is well-exemplified by the secretion of different exosomes sub-populations — 
1487 
with distinct morphology and composition — from apical and basolateral sides 
1488 
of polarized cells such as intestinal epithelial cells193 194 195. Such exosome 
1489 
sub-populations are likely originating from sub-populations of MVEs. The 
1490 
distinct composition of these subpopulations reflects on the presence of 
1491 
multiple sorting machineries that act on the MVE compartment. It remains to 
1492 
be determined whether the different sorting machineries act on distinct sub-
1493 
populations of MVEs (see part on right) or concomitantly in single MVEs to 
1494 
generate distinct sub-populations of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) (see part on 
1495 
the left). The reality is most likely a mix of these two possibilities, with distinct 
1496 
contribution depending on the cell type. Recruitment of a given sorting 
1497 
machinery can depend on the maturation stage of the producing cells52 74, on 
1498 
the post-translational modification of the cargo (for example: proteolytic 
1499 
processing, ubiquitylation) 49,193 or potentially on the stage of maturation of 
1500 
MVEs. The type of sorting machinery recruited to MVEs will also specify the 
1501 
fate of MVEs between exosome secretion and lysosomal degradation.

1504 
Figure 4: Interdependency of intracellular trafficking routes in the generation 
1505 
of extracellular vesicles 
1506 
The generation of exosomes and microvesicles requires a tuned regulation of 
1507 
multiple intracellular trafficking steps (blue arrows for exosomes, green arrows 
1508 
for microvesicles) that influence the targeting of cargoes to the site of 
1509 
extracellular vesicle biogenesis as well as for exosomes, the fate of the 
1510 
multivesicular endosome (MVE) from which these vesicles originate. Cargoes 
1511 
targeted to MVEs originate from endocytosis at the plasma membrane or are 
1512 
directly targeted to MVEs or to early sorting endosomes via the biosynthetic 
1513 
pathway (from the trans-Golgi Network (TGN)). Retrograde transport towards 
1514 
the TGN or recycling back to the plasma membrane will divert cargoes from 
1515 
their targeting to MVE (dashed arrows) and therefore their incorporation into 
1516 
ILVs. These sorting processes are regulated by various Rab GTPases. Once 
1517 
matured, MVEs that are not targeted to lysosomes or autophagosomes for 
1518 
degradation are transported to the plasma membrane on microtubules. At this 
1519 


----- Page 40 (native text) -----
 
39
step, docking and fusion are the two final processes required for exosome 
1520 
release. Rabs, actin and soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment 
1521 
protein receptor (SNARE) proteins are involved in these steps of exosome 
1522 
release. In the case of microvesicle biogenesis, endocytic uptake (dashed 
1523 
arrow) and recycling will respectively decrease and increase the targeting of 
1524 
membrane (and membrane bound) cargoes to microvesicles. Of note, as the 
1525 
release of exosomes requires tightly regulated steps of transport, tethering 
1526 
and fusion of MVE to plasma membrane (apart from cargo sorting) this could 
1527 
account for the time difference between the generation and release of both 
1528 
types of extracellular vesicles. OK * denotes proteins of Caenorhabditis

Figure 5: Fate of extracellular vesicles in recipient cells.  
1533 
In recipient cell (which can be the producing cell itself) exogenous 
1534 
extracellular vesicles will bind to the cell surface (see inset) and can follow 
1535 
various fates. Depending on the cell type they can remain bound to the 
1536 
surface (for example to integrins) and can initiate intracellular signalling 
1537 
pathways (for example antigen presentation). Extracellular vesicles may also 
1538 
be internalized by multiple routes. Internalization will target exogenous 
1539 
extracellular vesicles into the canonical endosomal pathway, whereby they 
1540 
reach multivesicular endosomes (MVEs) where the uptaken vesicles will likely 
1541 
mix with endogenous intraluminal vesicles (ILVs). Fusion of MVEs with the 
1542 
lysosome will lead to the degradation of extracellular vesicles and the 
1543 
recycling of their content to fuel recipient cell metabolism. Extracellular 
1544 
vesicles either docked at the plasma membrane or at the limiting membrane 
1545 
of MVEs can release their intraluminal content into the cytoplasm of the 
1546 
recipient cell by fusion, a process which is so far poorly understood but of 
1547 
major importance for delivery of intraluminal cargoes such as miRNA. Of note, 
1548 
there is no evidence so far to exclude potential recycling to the plasma 
1549 
membrane of endocytosed vesicles (dashed arrows). ECM, extracellular

proteins through their phosphorylation.  
1654 
 
1655 
P2x7 receptors: trimeric ATP-gated cation channels found predominantly, but 
1656 
not exclusively, on immune cells, which have been implicated in various 
1657 
inflammatory, immune, neurologic and musculoskeletal disorders. 
1658 
 
1659 
follicular dendritic cells: cells of the immune system found in primary and 
1660 
secondary lymph follicles of the B cell areas of the lymphoid tissue. 
1661 
 
1662 
lectin: a carbohydrate-binding protein that is highly specific for sugar 
1663 
moieties.  
1664 
 
1665 
proteoglycans: heavily glycosylated proteins consisting of a “core protein” 
1666 
with one or more covalently attached glycosaminoglycans (GAG) chains 
1667 
 
1668 
Intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs): member of the immunoglobulin 
1669 
superfamily, which are involved in inflammation, immune responses and in 
1670 
intracellular signalling events.  
1671 
 
1672 
macropinocytosis a form of regulated endocytosis that involves the non-
1673 
specific uptake of extracellular material (such as small soluble molecules, 
1674 
nutrients, antigens) by invagination of the plasma membrane, which is then 
1675 
pinched resulting in small vesicles in the cytoplasm. 
1676 
 
1677 
trophoblast: cells which form the outer layer of a blastocyst, provide nutrients 
1678 
to the embryo and give rise to a large part of the placenta. 
1679 
 
1680 
microglia: a type of brain glial cell acting as the first and main endogenous 
1681 
immune defense in the central nervous system  
1682 
 
1683

astrocytes: star-shaped glial cells in the brain involved in nutrient supply, 
1684 
maintenance of extracellular ion balance and in tissue repair following brain 
1685 
injuries  
1686 
 
1687 
filopodia: highly dynamic actin-rich cell-surface protrusions used by cells to 
1688 
sense their external environment.  
1689 
 
1690 
suicide mRNA/protein: suicide gene which encodes nonmammalian 
1691 
enzymes that convert an inactive drug into highly toxic metabolites that inhibit 
1692 
the synthesis of nucleic acids and causes cells to go to apotosis 
1693

Key points  
1698 
 Secretion of extracellular vesicles was initially described as means of 
1699 
selective elimination of proteins, lipids and RNA from the cells. Now, 
1700 
extracellular vesicles are also considered as a new mode of 
1701 
intercellular communication. 
1702 
 In any given setting, population of extracellular vesicles comprises 
1703 
diverse subpopulations that can differ in size, morphology, composition 
1704 
or biogenesis mechanisms. Complementary methods of analysis are 
1705 
required to distinguish between these subpopulations.  
1706 
 Several machineries, prominently including components of the 
1707 
endocytic sorting machineries, act concomitantly for the generation of 
1708 
extracellular vesicles. In result, extracellular vesicles can largely vary in 
1709 
terms of their composition and may carry specific sets of proteins, 
1710 
lipids, RNA species that then determine their fate and functions. 
1711 
 Generation of extracellular vesicles requires a fine tuning of various 
1712 
intracellular trafficking processes, which define the composition of 
1713 
nascent vesicles and impact their generation and, in the case of 
1714 
exosomes, their secretion from an intracellular compartment.  
1715

 Interactions of extracellular vesicles with recipient cells and their can 
1716 
have various effects on the target cell, from stimulating signalling 
1717 
pathways to providing trophic support, which depends on the mode of 
1718 
interaction and the intracellular fate of the vesicles in case of their 
1719 
uptake.  
1720 
 Studies of the cell biology of extracellular vesicles is not only essential 
1721 
for addressing cell biological questions but is also critical to open new 
1722 
avenues for their clinical use as biomarkers, cargo vehicles for targeted 
1723 
delivery of compounds or as specific modulators of cell behaviours.
