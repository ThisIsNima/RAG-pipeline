ABSTRACT
The UniProt Knowledgebase is a collection of se-
quences and annotations for over 120 million pro-
teins across all branches of life. Detailed annotations
extracted from the literature by expert curators have
been collected for over half a million of these pro-
teins. These annotations are supplemented by an-
notations provided by rule based automated sys-
tems, and those imported from other resources. In
this article we describe signiﬁcant updates that we
have made over the last 2 years to the resource. We
have greatly expanded the number of Reference Pro-
teomes that we provide and in particular we have
focussed on improving the number of viral Refer-
ence Proteomes. The UniProt website has been aug-
mented with new data visualizations for the subcel-
lular localization of proteins as well as their struc-
ture and interactions. UniProt resources are avail-
able under a CC-BY (4.0) license via the web at
https://www.uniprot.org/.
INTRODUCTION
The proteins expressed in a cell at any moment of time de-
termine its function, its topology, how it reacts to changes
in environment and ultimately its longevity and well-being.
Improvements in experimental techniques are providing
ever deeper information on the structure and function of in-
dividual proteins, whilst large-scale sequencing efforts are
driving increased coverage of the complete proteomes of
the breadth of organisms that populate the tree of life. Our
challenge is to capture the growing depth and breadth of in-
formation and make it easily available and interpretable to
our users. The UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) com-
bines reviewed UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries, to which
data have been added by our expert biocuration team,
with the unreviewed UniProtKB/TrEMBL entries which
are annotated by automated systems including our rule-
based systems. The output from large-scale sequencing
projects form the vast majority of the ∼120 million entries
in UniProtKB/TrEMBL. Improved metagenomic assembly
and binning tools are resulting in an increasing number of
high-quality metagenomic assembled genomes (MAGs) be-
ing represented in the database. Additionally, we provide the
UniRef databases that cluster sequence sets at various lev-
els of sequence identity and the UniProt Archive (UniParc)
that delivers a complete set of known sequences, including
historical obsolete sequence.
We describe the major developments that we have made
since our last update published in this journal in 2017
(1) with a focus on how we are positioning the UniProt
database to address the challenges of the increased volume
of sequence data entering the database.
PROGRESS AND DEVELOPMENTS
Growth of sequences in UniProt
The UniProtKB Proteomes portal (https://www.uniprot.
org/proteomes/) provides access to proteomes for over 84
thousand (84 387, release 2018 07) species with completely
sequenced genomes. The majority of these proteomes are
based on the translation of genome sequence submissions
to the INSDC source databases––ENA, GenBank and the
DDBJ (2). To ensure comprehensiveness, complementary
pipelines have been developed to supplement these with
genomes sequenced and/or annotated by groups such as
Ensembl (3), Vectorbase (4) and WormBase ParaSite (5).
This has been extended to RefSeq genomes, allowing us to
import key genomes of special interest annotated by NCBI’s
Eukaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline. Release 2018 03,
for example, saw the inclusion of a set of primate proteomes
and a dozen genomes for marine mammals were imported
from RefSeq for release 2018 08. Taxa may be specifically
targeted by curators to fill gaps in the taxonomic space and

additional proteome import can be requested by individual
users.
The continuing growth of sequenced genomes is a chal-
lenge for databases as much of this growth is being driven by
sequencing of very similar and almost identical strains (90%
of proteins have >90% identity) of the same species. We con-
tinue to see exponential growth in many of our datasets,
see Figure 1. We are managing this growth by a number
of processes. Most critically, a redundancy removal pro-
cess was first introduced in 2015. This process identifies
and removes almost identical proteomes of the same species
before their inclusion in UniProtKB (https://www.uniprot.
org/help/proteome redundancy) and places their sequences
in UniParc. Currently this process has removed ∼38% all
complete proteomes (∼241 million proteins) from UniPro-
tKB. As can be seen in Figure 1, the redundancy reduction
both greatly reduced the size of UniProtKB as well as made
its growth more scalable. This approach has now been ex-
tended from prokaryotes to fungi, resulting in the depreca-
tion of ∼1 million fungal protein records in release 2016 08.
Reference proteomes
For the remaining proteomes we provide a Reference Pro-
teome set (∼9% of total proteomes) selected by the research
community and supplemented with selected proteomes
from a computational clustering (6) to provide the best an-
notated proteome in their cluster. Recently, we have added
virus Reference Proteomes (described below) to this list.
The growth of Reference Proteome sets is shown in Figure
2. Programmatic access to the non-redundant proteomes
included in UniProtKB is provided via the Proteins API
(https://www.ebi.ac.uk/proteins/api/doc/) (7) whilst all pro-
teomes reference, non-reference and redundant in UniPro-
tKB and UniParc are accessible via the Proteome section of
the UniProt website (https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/).
UniProt reference proteomes are used by user commu-
nities such as the Quest for Orthologs (QfO) group as
the ‘gold standard’ reference proteome dataset for ortho-
logue benchmarking (8). The QfO reference proteomes
datasets are a compiled subset of the UniProt reference pro-
teomes, comprising well-annotated model organisms and
organisms of interest for biomedical research and phy-
logeny, with the intention to provide broad coverage of
the tree of life whilst maintaining a low number of pro-
teomes for the benchmark. Such datasets have been gener-
ated annually from the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniPro-
tKB) database for the past seven years. To this end, a gene-
centric pipeline has been developed and enhanced over the
past year by UniProt. These complete, non-redundant refer-
ence proteomes are publicly available at ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/
pub/databases/reference proteomes/QfO. The datasets are
provided either in SeqXML format or as a collection of
FASTA files and include genomics coordinates for most
proteins. In the last release for QfO in April, the number
of species increased from 66 to 78 comprising 1,311,679
non-redundant protein sequences (48 Eukaryotes and 30
bacteria-archaea).
At the time of our previous publication, the number
of virus Reference Proteomes in UniProtKB stood at
428––practically an order of magnitude less than the num-
ber of known viral species (which stands at 4405 according
to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses,
or ICTV). To improve Reference Proteome Coverage of
viruses in UniProt we have undertaken a concerted effort
to curate Complete Proteomes and to use these as input
for the computational selection of Reference Proteomes. We
compiled and curated complete viral genome (proteome)
data from INSDC (which feeds into UniProt) as well as a
range of other specialized viral genome resources including
ViPr (9), IRD (10), the HIV database (https://www.hiv.lanl.
gov/), Papillomavirus Episteme (11) and the HCV database
(https://hcv.lanl.gov/) and HBV database (12). This cura-
tion effort included the identification and removal of seg-
mented viruses lacking one or more segments, and increased
the number of the Complete Proteomes of viral origin in
UniProt to 86 951 (UniProt release 2018 07). Computa-
tional clustering of this enhanced viral Complete Proteome
set (13) produced 5,887 viral Reference Proteomes. Note
that redundancy removal procedures are not currently ap-
plied to viruses, due to the challenges posed by the high
number of variants in the small genomes of these species.
Technological advances have enabled the sequencing of
the genetic material from all the microorganisms in a par-
ticular environment without the cultivation of any of the
community members. Concurrent advances in bioinfor-
matics have enabled the rapid assembly of genomes from
metagenomes (MAGs) and a corresponding input of se-
quence data into the UniProt database with >4800 assem-
bled proteomes in the database (4839, release 2018 07).
The existing data input pipeline is currently based on those
submissions to the INSDC which fulfil certain threshold
criteria but future plans are to move to using the EBI
Metagenomics resource, MGnify (14), as the main source of
metagenome derived assemblies. We will include only those
MAGs that show a high level of completeness and a low
level of contamination.
Expert curation progress
Expert curation of the literature is critically important to
the UniProt databases. The information extracted from sci-
entific publications is stored in the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
section of the UniProt Knowledgebase and describes func-
tional information both in the form of human readable free-
text/controlled syntax summaries and via structured vocab-
ularies such as the Gene Ontology (GO) (15) or ChEBI (16).
Expert curation is labour intensive, with curators assimilat-
ing and evaluating multiple lines of evidence from the text
and figures of relevant publications, but this has repeatedly
proven to be the most efficient method of extracting all rel-
evant data from a paper. We have previously demonstrated
that UniProtKB expert biocuration captures between 35
and 45% of the curatable literature for any given species,
rising to 50% of the curatable literature for Homo sapiens
(17). UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries serve as a source of
functional data for the development and enhancement of
bioinformatics prediction tools, so we prioritize the capture
of functional data that cannot currently be correctly pre-
dicted by computational methods, such as proteins which
predictive protein signatures would describe as being part
of an enzyme family but are in fact non-functional due to

the loss of specific amino acid residues. An example of this
is PLC1 (UniProtKB:Q15111), a member of the phospho-
inositide phospholipase C family (InterPro:IPR001192) in
which the existence of an asparagine residue in the active
site instead of the conserved histidine residue suggests a
non-catalytic role for this protein. This has broader appli-
cations than the annotation of just one protein as infor-
mation on protein function is computationally transferred
from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot to sequence-related, but less
well studied, proteins in UniProtKB/TrEMBL. Therefore,
it is important to ensure we have a broad enough collec-
tion of annotated proteins in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot to add
value to new entries as the taxonomic range of fully se-
quenced proteomes continues to expand.

Once a record has been moved into UniProtKB/Swiss-
Prot from UniProtKB/TrEMBL, there is a concerted ef-
fort to ensure that it is regularly updated to ensure the
current understanding of a protein’s activity reflects that
in the scientific literature. This task can be difficult, as
our knowledge of protein function continues to evolve and
finer grained experimental techniques provide new knowl-
edge that may appear to contradict previous observations.
An example of this is provided by the proteins involved
in N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification which takes
place on both coding and non-coding RNAs containing a
Pu[G>A]m6AC[A/C/U] (Pu = purine) sequence, the nu-
cleotide A3 of which becomes N6-methylated. The modi-
fication acts as a key regulator of mRNA stability: methy-
lation is completed upon the release of mRNA into the nu-
cleoplasm and affects various processes, such as mRNA sta-
bility, processing, translation efficiency and editing. The en-
zymes that catalyse this process were believed to have been
fully characterized some years ago, but more recent data has
changed our understanding of how these molecules work.
m6A methylation is performed by a heteromeric WMM
N6-adenosine-methyltransferase
complex,
originally
thought to be a heterotrimer of METTL3 (UniPro-
tKB:Q86U44), METTL14 (UniProtKB:Q9HCE5) and
WTAP (UniProtKB:Q15007), but additional component
subunits have recently been identified (18). Initial work
indicated that METTL3 and METTL14 form a tight
heterodimer in order to perform catalysis on the preferred
motif sequence. Both proteins are members of the MT-A70
family and are classified as S-adenosyl-L-methionine-
dependent
methyltransferases
by
sequence
prediction
resources. Methyltransferase activity has been reported for
both (19). Subsequent structural studies have now shown
that that only one protein, METTL3, constitutes the cat-
alytic subunit (20–22). The other subunit, METTL14, has a
degenerate active site that is unable to accommodate donor
and acceptor substrates and plays a non-catalytic role in
maintaining complex integrity and substrate RNA binding
(22). WTAP appears to serve as a regulatory subunit. A
newly identified subunit of the WMM methyltransferase
complex, VIRMA (UniProtKB:Q69YN4) plays a role in
mediating mRNA m6A methylation in 3′UTRs and near
stop codons and in recruiting the methyltransferase core
components.
Expert biocuration has been essential in keeping the rel-
evant UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries up to date with each
step in the pathway to reflect our understanding of the func-
tion of these proteins and the molecules they associate with.
Every piece of knowledge we capture is associated with evi-
dences (see https://www.uniprot.org/help/evidences for fur-
ther details) to indicate the source of information and we
have added a CAUTION comment to the METTL14 en-
try to both provide some background and inform users that
the initially reported methyltransferase activity is an un-
safe observation (Figure 3). The correct annotation on the
UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entry will ensure that misleading
data is not computationally added to orthologous proteins
in UniProtKB/TrEMBL on the basis of an over-predictive
protein signature, again highlighting the importance of ex-
pert biocuration. Future plans for the manual curation ac-
tivities in UniProtKB include the development of mecha-
nisms to identify and highlight contradictory information
in existing protein entries in order to improve rigor and re-
producibility. This example also illustrates the collaborative
nature of the UniProt Consortium in that the molecular in-
teractions involved have also been added to the IMEx Con-
sortium (www.imexconsortium.org) dataset by UniProt cu-
rators (23), the protein complexes involved curated into
the Complex Portal (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/complexportal/)
(24) and both the proteins and complexes have been fur-
ther annotated using GO (http://www.geneontology.org).
New terms were added to the GO to enable this and others
were updated. All of these data are subsequently reimported
back to enrich the appropriate entries in UniProtKB/Swiss-
Prot but are stored and maintained by these domain-specific
resources.
Automatic annotation progress
UniProt’s automatic annotation pipelines enrich the un-
reviewed records in UniProtKB/TrEMBL with classifica-
tion and functional annotations. InterPro is used to clas-
sify sequences at superfamily, family and subfamily lev-
els and to predict the occurrence of functional domains
and important sites. InterPro integrates predictive mod-
els of protein function, so-called ‘signatures’, from a num-
ber of member databases. In UniProtKB/TrEMBL entries,
domains from the InterPro member databases PROSITE,
SMART or Pfam are predicted and used to automatically
provide domain annotations. All automatic annotations
are labelled with their evidence/source. UniProt has de-
veloped two complementary rule-based prediction systems,
UniRule and the Statistical Automatic Annotation System
(SAAS) to automatically annotate UniProtKB/TrEMBL in
an efficient and scalable manner with a high degree of accu-
racy. These prediction systems can annotate protein prop-
erties such as protein names, function, catalytic activity,
pathway membership and subcellular location, along with
sequence-specific information, such as the positions of post-
translational modifications and active sites. We continue to
increase the number of Rules used for annotation and this
has now grown to over 6000 in total as shown in Figure 4.
Ongoing developments in automatic annotation
We are evaluating new methods for computational annota-
tion of function based on based specifically on their domain
architecture (DAAC, or Domain Architecture Alignment
and Classification) (22,25) or any combination of sequence
properties and features (ARBA, or Association-Rule-Based
Annotator).
The Domain Architecture Alignment and Classification
system (DAAC, (25)) is based on the assumption that not
only the presence of domains is important for the protein to
perform its function but also their architecture i.e. their ar-
rangement and order. It performs the prediction in four ma-
jor steps. Firstly, it generates the different ordered combina-
tions of InterPro domains, these combinations are termed
domain architectures (DA). Secondly, it calculates the pair-
wise similarity between DAs using alignment. The third step
is that of training. In this phase, clusters of proteins are cre-
ated, where each cluster represents a single annotation. A

threshold of belonging is determined for each cluster while
maximising the classification performance, and then anno-
tations corresponding to low performance clusters are dis-
carded. In the final step, the clusters along with their cor-
responding thresholds serve as models to annotate other
query proteins. The fact that DAAC takes into account the
arrangement of domains within proteins allows it to make
more accurate predictions for specific cases where proteins
can have the same set of domains but with different arrange-
ments and hence could perform different functions. Based
on UniProt release 2018 05, DAAC generates 7 095 966 EC
predictions. 3 880 775 of them are new predictions (not pre-
dicted by UniRule or SAAS). Furthermore, DAAC gener-
ates 82 285 267 predictions of GO Terms for 20 827 747
distinct proteins in UniProtKB/TrEMBL. In total, 47 992
323 of the predictions are new (not predicted by UniRule or
SAAS).
Association rule mining and selection techniques can be
used effectively as computational methods for functional
prediction. ARBA (Association-Rule-Based Annotator) is
based on these techniques and can be used to enhance the
quality of automatically generated annotations as well as
annotating proteins with unknown functions. It learns on
data from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and uses InterPro sig-
natures and organism taxonomy as attributes to predict
most of the protein functional annotations including GO
terms, metabolic pathways, EC numbers, etc. With respect
to certain quality measures, ARBA finds all rules which
would define significant relationships between attributes
and functional annotations in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot en-
tries. The set of extracted rules represent the comprehensive
knowledge which could explain protein functions. How-
ever, these rules comprise redundant information and their
high number makes it infeasible to apply them on large sets
of data such as UniProtKB/TrEMBL. To address this is-
sue, ARBA puts these rules into a fast competition pro-
cess called SkyRule based on two concepts, namely domi-
nance and comparability. Rules are then elegantly and con-
siderably reduced in number and aggregated to form con-
cise prediction models that assign functional annotations
to UniProtKB entries.
In order to share our knowledge in computational an-
notation and our rule-based systems, we are working on
developing standard formats for rule annotation and tools
to apply them. UniFire (the UNIprot Functional anno-
tation Inference Rule Engine) is a standalone tool to ap-
ply the UniProt annotation rules on third party data. This
engine is based on a Business Rules Management System
(BRMS) named Drools and is developed in conjunction
with an exchangeable format for UniProt rules and the pro-
tein data to be annotated. we termed it URML (Uniprot
Rule Markup Language). URML respects the definition of
business rules, and is therefore executable. When applied
on third party proteins, UniFire will transform the data ac-
cording to the URML format and execute the UniProt rules
on them to generate functional predictions. We would like to
work with the scientific community in this development and
encourage users to register their interest in the links provide

in our blog Inside UniProt (https://insideuniprot.blogspot.
com/2018/03/).
A new change in UniRef to provide GO annotation was
based on user feedback. The UniRef databases (UniProt
Reference Clusters) provide clustered sets of sequences from
the UniProt Knowledgebase and selected UniParc records
to obtain complete coverage of sequence space at several
resolutions while hiding redundant sequences. Our study
indicated functional annotations are generally preserved in
UniRef clusters due to the intra-cluster homogeneity (26).
The GO terms of member protein sequences are highly con-
sistent at UniRef90/50 levels in each of the three GO do-
mains: Molecular Function, Biological Process and Cel-
lular Component. We have started to compute GO anno-
tations last year for UniRef90 and UniRef50 clusters: A
GO term is assigned to a cluster when it is found in every
UniProtKB member that has GO annotation in this clus-
ter, or when it is a common ancestor of at least one GO
term from each such member. We evaluated the GO term
prediction by comparing the protein sequences that newly
acquired GO annotation with the ones that GO terms were
assigned by UniRef in previous releases. The overall rate of
prediction precision is higher than 97%, in all three GO do-
mains, indicating the confidence to propagate UniRef GO
annotation to member sequences. Thus, UniRef provides
an annotation source to our users. They can search against
UniRef and then obtain GO annotation from their results.
GO annotations of UniRef can be found in the UniRef
XML files from the UniProt ftp site: ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/
pub/databases/uniprot/uniref/uniref50/.
For the release 2018 06, 25 300 GO terms were assigned
to 33 814 200 UniRef90 clusters and 21 000 GO terms were
assigned to 11 235 770 UniRef50 Clusters.
UniProt bibliography
UniProt compiles additional bibliography from exter-
nal sources to complement the curated literature set in
UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot with additional publications and to
add relevant literature to UniProtKB/TrEMBL entries not
yet curated. The sources of literature are of two types: bi-
ological databases (currently 22 sources, including model
organism, structure, post-translational modification, func-
tion, disease and interaction databases) where the litera-

ture mapped to UniProt entries are added in a collabora-
tive manner, and secondly, text mining (currently PubTa-
tor Tmvar for literature about human variants in disease
(27) and pGenN (28) for literature related to plant proteins).
Altogether these sources add 902 956 unique papers cov-
ering 363 591 entries, with a total of 36 147 401 UniProt
accession-PubMed identifier (accession/PMID) pairs (Re-
lease 2018 08).
In the entry publication section, publications providing
evidence for a specific annotation type are organized across
different categories, such as function, interaction and ex-
pression, based on the type of data they contain. This cat-
egorization facilitates navigation through the protein entry
literature by offering users quick access to literature of in-
terest related to a given protein-topic. The classification of
the UniProt references is automatically done based on the
topics found in the flat file RP lines that are linked to the ref-
erences, whereas the computationally mapped bibliography
has to be categorized in a different way.
As a first approach, we rely on the information provided
by the underlying database sources for this categorization
(e.g. the literature provided by iPTMnet (29) will fall into
PTM/Processing category and literature provided by Intact
will be classified as Interaction). However, this approach
is not optimal for all literature, thus we are now system-
atically classifying the articles into the UniProt main cate-
gories present in the entry using UPCLASS, a neural net-
work based pipeline to classify publications for UniPro-
tKB protein entries, developed in SIB Text Mining group
(https://www.sib.swiss/ruch-patrick/patrick-ruch-sub). UP-
CLASS has been trained and evaluated with the curated lit-
erature and categories in UniProt entries (with precision,
recall and F-score of 0.80, 0.62 and 0.70, respectively). The
model used for UniProt classification considers the protein
names corresponding to the accession-PMID pair, resulting
in a more accurate protein-centric classification. Implemen-
tation of UPCLASS has enabled the classification of 32 196
740 UniProt accession-PMID pairs that have been previ-
ously displayed as unclassified, representing 254 038 protein
entries and 768 505 PMIDs (Release 2018 08).
Outreach and training
The training of our users to make the best use of our data,
whether accessed via the web, the API or downloaded from
the FTP site, is a key mission of the UniProt Consortium.
We have played an active role in the provision of hands-
on training workshops across the globe, supporting both
early-career researchers and domain specialists such as clin-
icians and proteomic scientists. Whilst face-to-face training
will remain an important route for disseminating very de-
tailed information, it is not always the most efficient method
of reaching out to large numbers of users or of penetrat-
ing new user groups. We have therefore scheduled a series
of webinars, with basic modules on searching protein se-
quence and function repeated regularly and more special-
ist units, for example on protein structure, machine learn-
ing protein function and linking protein and genome an-
notation delivered less often. The webinars are recorded,
and are subsequently made available online (https://www.
ebi.ac.uk/training/online/) where they are supported by re-
lated online training materials and YouTube videos (https:
//www.youtube.com/user/uniprotvideos/). In order to reach

new communities, the webinars are widely advertised, mak-
ing pro-active use of social media forums such as Twit-
ter (@uniprot) and FaceBook (https://www.facebook.com/
uniprot.org/) as well as established mailing lists.
Website developments
During the last year we have added three new visualizations
to the UniProt website. Firstly, we have added a method for
viewing molecular interactions, secondly a method for view-
ing the subcellular localization of the proteins and finally
we have added a molecular structure viewer. Together these
enable users to rapidly understand the molecular context of
UniProt entries.
For UniProtKB entries that include an Interaction sec-
tion, we show details of the protein’s binary interactions
with other proteins, using a high-quality dataset supplied by
the IMEx Consortium. The binary interactions of a protein
are now shown as a matrix that shows the interaction part-
ners of your protein and also shows which of those partners
interact with each other. For example, the interaction ma-
trix for the human E3 ubiquitin–protein ligase parkin pro-
tein (UniProtKB:O60260) is shown in Figure 5.
One of the sections on the protein entry pages is Sub-
cellular Location. This section provides information on
the location and the topology of the mature protein in
the cell. We now allow users to visually explore the sub-
cellular location in UniProtKB entries. The visualization
presents image templates from COMPARTMENTS (https:
//compartments.jensenlab.org/) (28,30) combined with pro-
tein location data from UniProt (expert annotation, rule-
based automatic annotation) and imported from GO anno-
tation. Figure 6 below shows the subcellular location view
from the Human Copper-transporting ATPase 2 protein
(UniProtKB:P35670).
Structural information is important in understanding the
molecular mechanisms that allow proteins to perform their
specific functions. UniProt now provides a protein structure
viewer in the ‘Structure’ section of the entry view of the web-
site as well as in the ProtVista protein viewer (see Figure
7). The structures are rendered using the Litemol viewer.
This innovation helps users to connect protein information
in UniProt with structural data.
CONCLUSION
UniProt continually develops its processes and procedures
to efficiently provide a global collection of protein se-
quences and annotations. Over the past two years we have
seen significant growth in numbers of genomes and proteins

sequences. We have continued to organize that data and pro-
vide it to our users in a variety of user-friendly ways. We
have recently also updated the terms of our license to a CC-
BY (4.0) making it easier for UniProt data to be reused by
others.
A critical component for UniProt is to connect papers
to the relevant entries. In this paper we have described how
this is carried out by our expert curators as well as how we
supplement these curated papers by connecting papers from
other databases and text mining tools. You can help enable
curators and text mining tools to connect your scientific
papers to UniProt and other molecular biology databases
through tagging mentions of proteins with UniProt iden-
tifiers. We request that authors use the following format
(UniProtKB:P68369) to describe a protein within the text
of a paper. This formatting follows the compact identifier
representation that has been recently proposed to enable
uniform resolution of biomedical resource identifiers (31).
Using this format can also provide a simple mechanism to
refer to other data resources. Some journals already have
specific formatting requirements for such citations to acces-
sions and these should always be given precedence.
We greatly value the feedback and annotation updates
from our user community. Please send your feedback and
suggestions to the e-mail address help@uniprot.org or via
the contact link on the UniProt website.
