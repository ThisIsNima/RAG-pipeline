CONTEMPORARY SOCIAL THEORY 
General Editor: ANTHONY GIDDENS 
This series aims to create a forum for debate between different 
theoretical and philosophical traditions in the social sciences. As 
well as covering broad schools of thought, the series will also con-
centrate upon the work of particular thinkers whose ideas have had 
a major impact on social science (these books appear under the sub-
series title of 'Theoretical Traditions in the Social Sciences'). The 
series is not limited to abstract theoretical discussion - it will also 
include more substantive works on contemporary capitalism, the 
state, politics, and other subject areas.
