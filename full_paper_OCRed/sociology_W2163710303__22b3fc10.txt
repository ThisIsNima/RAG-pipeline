Global, regional and national prevalence of overweight and 
obesity in children and adults 1980-2013: A systematic analysis
A full list of authors and affiliations appears at the end of the article.
Abstract
Background—In 2010, overweight and obesity were estimated to cause 3.4 million deaths, 3.9% 
of years of life lost, and 3.8% of DALYs globally. The rise in obesity has led to widespread calls 
for regular monitoring of changes in overweight and obesity prevalence in all populations. 
Comparative, up-to-date information on levels and trends is essential both to quantify population 
health effects and to prompt decision-makers to prioritize action.
Methods—We systematically identified surveys, reports, and published studies (n = 1,769) that 
included information on height and weight, both through physical measurements and self-reports. 
Mixed effects linear regression was used to correct for the bias in self-reports. Age-sex-country-
year observations (n = 19,244) on prevalence of obesity and overweight were synthesized using a 
spatio-temporal Gaussian Process Regression model to estimate prevalence with 95% uncertainty 
intervals.
Findings—Globally, the proportion of adults with a body mass index (BMI) of 25 or greater 
increased from 28.8% (95% UI: 28.4-29.3) in 1980 to 36.9% (36.3-37.4) in 2013 for men and 
from 29.8% (29.3-30.2) to 38.0% (37.5-38.5) for women. Increases were observed in both 
developed and developing countries. There have been substantial increases in prevalence among 
children and adolescents in developed countries, with 23.8% (22.9-24.7) of boys and 22.6% 
(21.7-23.6) of girls being either overweight or obese in 2013. The prevalence of overweight and 
obesity is also rising among children and adolescents in developing countries as well, rising from 
8.1% (7.7-8.6) to 12.9% (12.3-13.5) in 2013 for boys and from 8.4% (8.1-8.8) to 13.4% 
(13.0-13.9) in girls. Among adults, estimated prevalence of obesity exceeds 50% among men in 
Tonga and women in Kuwait, Kiribati, Federated States of Micronesia, Libya, Qatar, Tonga, and 
Samoa. Since 2006, the increase in adult obesity in developed countries has stabilized.
Interpretation—Because of the established health risks and substantial increases in prevalence, 
obesity has become a major global health challenge. Contrary to other major global risks, there is 
little evidence of successful population-level intervention strategies to reduce exposure. Not only 
is obesity increasing, but there are no national success stories over the past 33 years. Urgent global 
action and leadership is required to assist countries to more effectively intervene.

Introduction
The rising prevalence of overweight and obesity in a number of countries1–5 has been 
described as a global pandemic.6–8 In 2010, overweight and obesity already were estimated 
to cause 3.4 million deaths, 3.9% of years of life lost and 3.8% of disability adjusted life 
years (DALYs) globally.9 Studies in the USA have suggested that, unabated, the rise in 
obesity could well lead to future declines in life expectancy.10 Concern about the health 
risks associated with rising obesity has become nearly universal; Member States of the 
World Health Organization adopted a voluntary target of halting the rise in obesity by 
2025.11 There have been widespread calls for regular monitoring of changes in overweight 
and obesity prevalence in all populations.12–15
Monitoring of trends in the prevalence of overweight and obesity depends on household 
surveys. Many health interview surveys include questions on self-reported weight and height 
that have been used to monitor trends overtime;16–18 however, estimates of BMI from self-
reported data have been shown to be biased downwards.19–21 Examination surveys provide 
direct measurements of weight and height but many fewer countries conduct repeated 
national examination surveys, and estimates from them may be biased because of low 
participation rates.19 Despite the lack of complete and unbiased information on overweight 
and obesity, various systematic analyses have tried to capture levels and trends. Finucane et 
al.2 used data from 369 national surveys and 591 sub-national surveys to estimate country 
trends in mean BMI between 1980 and 2008. De Onis et al.3 examined 450 national surveys 
to estimate trends in childhood obesity and overweight from 1990 to 2020. Mean BMI 
estimates have been used to predict levels of overweight and obesity over the period 
1980-2008.1 These analyses suggest widespread increases in overweight and obesity have 
been occurring over the past few decades although recent country-specific analyses suggest 
that trends may have stabilized in some populations.22–24
Up to date information on levels and trends in overweight and obesity is essential both to 
quantify their health effects and to prompt decision-makers to prioritize action and evaluate 
where progress is, or is not, being made. As an integral component of the risk factor work 
for the Global Burden of Disease 2013 Study (GBD), we have analyzed trends by country in 
overweight and obesity from 1980 to 2013. In this paper, we report on the results of the 
systematic analysis carried out for the GBD 2013.
Methods
Definitions and data
Following convention, prevalence of overweight and obesity is defined based on body-mass 
index (BMI) calculated by mass as measured in kilograms divided by the square of height 
measured in meters (kg/m2) For adults (individuals above the age of 18 years), overweight is 
defined as having a BMI greater than or equal to 25 and lower than 30; obesity is defined as 
having a BMI greater than or equal to 30. For children and adolescents (individuals under 
the age of 18 years), classification of overweight and obesity is based on the International 
Obesity Task Force (IOTF) definition (see Webappendix for more details). We report 
estimates for 188 countries, 21 regions, and development status (developed or developing) 
et al.

as defined in the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD).25 Estimates of the prevalence of 
overweight and obesity are reported for men and women separately and for 17 age groups, 
starting at ages 2-4 years, and ending with the age group 80+ years.
We used several strategies to identify the data sources used in the analysis. First, we 
included all major multi-country survey programs which include information on height and 
weight, such as the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS),26 the WHO STEPwise 
approach to Surveillance (STEPS) program,27 the Eurobarometer Surveys,28 the Multiple 
Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS),29 the World Health Surveys (WHS),30 the Reproductive 
Health Surveys (RHS),31 the Survey of Healthy Ageing and Retirement in Europe 
(SHARE),32 and the International Social Survey Programmed (ISSP).33 Second, we 
searched three large databases (the WHO Global Infobase,34 the International Association 
for the Study of Obesity Data Portal,35 and the Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx),36 as 
well as national health ministry websites to identify national multi-year surveys, such as 
national health surveys and national longitudinal studies. Amongst 2,100 sources identified, 
331 were excluded due to limitations in the representativeness of the sample. More details 
on the surveys included and excluded from the current study are presented in Webappendix.
Third, we conducted a systematic literature review, using similar search criteria as those 
applied by Finucane et al.2 We identified all articles reporting on prevalence of overweight 
and obesity based on BMI from 1980 to 2012. Studies were included if the design involved a 
representative random sample of the population. Both self-report and measured data were 
considered (see Webappendix for details). Data identified in the systematic literature review 
were compared against the survey/report database. All duplicated data were dropped with 
preference given to survey microdata. Studies reporting on prevalence of overweight and 
obesity based on alternative measurements, such as waist-circumference and hip-waist ratio, 
were excluded from this study due to the lack of reliable data for converting prevalence 
based on these alternative measurements to an equivalent prevalence estimate based on 
BMI'. Further information on the specific search terms as well as inclusion and exclusion 
criteria for the systematic review are presented in the Webappendix.
In total, these sources provided 1,769 country-years of data and 19,244 country-year-age-sex 
data points from 183 countries. There were 5 countries with no data (Antigua and Barbuda, 
Brunei, Grenada, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Venezuela). A complete list of all the 
sources included in the analysis is shown in Webtable 6.
Data processing
Cross-walking different definitions—Self-reported weights for women in some 
countries tend to be under-reported and self-reported heights for men over-reported.19–21 
Self-reported weights and heights, however, are a major source of information. We 
examined the relationship between self-report and measured BMI using 671 country-years 
with both types of measurements available. We used a mixed effects linear regression to 
estimate bias correction factors for each GBD super-region, age, and sex. The uncertainty 
introduced from this adjustment was incorporated as the data variance and propagated into 
the Gaussian process regression described below. We have also conducted a sensitivity

analysis excluding all self-reported data from the analysis. More details on this analysis are 
shown in the Webappendix.
Several published reports presented data in broader age groups than those selected for this 
analysis and occasionally, for both sexes combined. We disaggregated these data into the 
required age and sex groups by applying an age-sex splitting model previously used in the 
GBD,37 which uses all surveys that provide information on multiple age-sex groupings as 
the reference standard to redistribute aggregated prevalence estimates into specific five-year 
age and sex groups of interest. More details are available in the Webappendix.
Model
In many cases, we had multiple sources of data for the same year implying different levels 
of prevalence. In other cases, there were gaps in the data sequence. To deal with both issues 
and generate a complete time series based on all the available data, we use a spatial-
temporal regression model (ST) and Gaussian process regression (GPR) to synthesize the 
data. ST-GPR has been used extensively to synthesize time series cross-sectional data.38–42 
ST-GPR serves as a powerful tool for interpolating and extrapolating non-linear trends. 
Specifically, it allows the borrowing of strength across space and time. In addition, rather 
than treating every data point with equal weight, the relative uncertainty of data is taken into 
account in the estimation procedure with less uncertain data given a higher weight. The 
Webappendix provides details of each step of the estimation process. In brief, we assume 
that the trend of overweight and obesity prevalence follows a Gaussian process, which is 
defined by a mean function m(·) and a covariance function Cov(·). To estimate the mean 
function, we apply a two-stage procedure. First, a linear model was fitted separately for each 
sex. Specifically for prevalence of overweight the following model is applied:
where 
 is the prevalence of overweight and obesity; the covariate is total kilocalories 
consumed per year per capita (Kcalpc,t) obtained from the Food and Agriculture 
Organization food balance sheets.43 Total kilocalories consumed per year per capita is used 
as a covariate given the association between food consumption and overweight and 
obesity.44 In addition, latitude (Lat) and urbanicity (Urban) as measured by the proportion 
of a countries land area having a population density of 1000 people/km2 or greater, were 
also included to measure the inter- and intra-country variation in overweight and obesity. 
Finally, a set of dummy indicators Iage and Iregion were included to capture the age pattern 
and regional variation respectively. To estimate the prevalence of obesity 
, a similar 
model is applied:
et al.

We model the prevalence of obesity as a fraction of the joint category of overweight and 
obesity. The rationale for using this strategy is to ensure that the prevalence of obesity does 
not exceed the joint category of overweight and obesity, which is bound between 0 and 1. 
We explored the use of other covariates to predict prevalence, including average income per 
capita and various measures of diet composition. Our results were not sensitive to the choice 
of these covariates and we present estimates based on the most parsimonious model. Details 
on the various model specifications considered are presented in Webtable 4.
While the linear component captures the general trend in prevalence, some of the data 
variability is still not adequately accounted for. To do so, a smoothing function which allows 
for borrowing strength across time, age, and space patterns was applied to the residuals from 
the linear model, as has been done repeatedly in the GBD analytical framework. Details are 
presented in the Webappendix.
In addition to defining the mean function, another key component in GPR is the covariance 
function, which defines the shape and distribution of trends. In this study, we applied the 
Matern covariance function, which offers flexibility to model a wide spectrum of trends with 
varying degrees of smoothness. Details are presented in the Webappendix.
Based on the mean and covariance function, estimates of overweight and obesity prevalence, 
 and 
, were derived for country c, age a, and sex s for time t*. The analysis was 
implemented though PyMC package in Python. Random draws of 1,000 samples were 
obtained from the marginal distributions of predicted prevalence of overweight and obesity 
for every country, age, and sex group. The final estimated prevalence for each country, age, 
and sex group was the mean of the draws. In addition, uncertainty intervals were obtained by 
taking the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles of the distributions. These uncertainty intervals reflect 
multiple sources of uncertainty, including the unexplained variance in the GPR mean 
function, sampling uncertainty, and uncertainty arising from the empirical adjustment of 
self-report data.
We conduct repeated cross-validation and estimate the root-mean squared error for the data 
held out in each cross-validation run and the percentage of the time that the 95% uncertainty 
interval for the data prediction includes the data held-out. The Webappendix provides the 
detailed results of the cross-validation which demonstrates that the modeling strategy has 
reasonable error and 95% uncertainty intervals that include close to 95% of the data held 
out.
Age-standardized prevalence rates for the population aged 20 years and older and for ages 
2-19 years were computed using the standard population distribution based on the average 
country-level population distribution by age from the World Population Prospects 2012 
revision.45
Results
Globally, prevalence of overweight and obesity combined has risen by 27.5% for adults and 
47.1% for children between 1980 and 2013. The number of overweight and obese

individuals has increased from 921 million in 1980 to 2.1 billion in 2013. Figures 1a and 1b 
show the trend in the age-standardized global prevalence of adult overweight and obesity 
together (1a) and obesity only (1b) as well as for developing and developed countries 
between 1980 and 2013. Globally, the proportion of adults with a BMI of 25 or greater 
increased from 28.8% (28.4-29.3) in 1980 to 36.9% (36.3-37.4) in 2013 for men and from 
29.8% (29.3-30.2) to 38.0% (37.5-38.5) for women. Increases were observed in developed 
and developing countries, but with different sex patterns. In developed countries, men have 
higher rates of overweight and obesity, while in developing countries, women exhibit higher 
rates and this relationship persists over time. Looking at rates of obesity only, Figure 1B 
shows increasing trends in both developed and developing regions. The prevalence of 
obesity is higher in women in developed and developing countries alike. The rate of increase 
of overweight and obesity appears to have been greatest between 1992 and 2002, but has 
slowed down over the last decade, particularly in developed countries.
Figures 2a and 2b show the trend in the age-standardized prevalence of overweight and 
obesity in children and adolescents (ages 2-19 years) for developing and developed 
countries. Developed countries show remarkable increases in prevalence at these ages since 
1980, with 23.8% (22.9-24.7) of boys and 22.6% (21.7-23.6) of girls being either 
overweight or obese in 2013 compared to 16.9% (16.1-17.7) of boys and 16.2% (15.5-17.1) 
of girls in 1980. The prevalence of overweight and obesity is also rising among children and 
adolescents in developing countries, increasing from 8.1% (7.7-8.6) in 1980 to 12.9% 
(12.3-13.5) in 2013 for boys and 8.4% (8.1-8.8) to 13.4% (13.0-13.9) in girls. In both 
developed and developing countries, gender differences in the levels and trends of 
overweight and obesity are small.
Figure 3 demonstrates the age pattern of overweight and obesity in 2013. At all ages, 
prevalence is higher in developed than developing countries. Age patterns differ in men and 
women and between developing and developed countries. In developed countries, men 
above age 15 show higher rates of overweight and obesity than women; in developing 
countries, women have higher rates than men above age 25 years. Overweight and obesity 
peak in developed country men around age 55 years, with two out of three men overweight 
and one in four obese. For developed country women, the peak age is closer to 60 years with 
31.3% (28.9-33.8) obese and 64.5% (62.5-66.5) overweight or obese. In developing 
countries, the age pattern of overweight and obesity is similar to that in developed countries, 
but the levels are much lower, with the highest level of obesity seen around age 55 years for 
women with a rate of 14.4% (13.5-15.5) and around 45 years for men with a rate of 8.1% 
(7.5-8.8).
Trends in adult age-standardized obesity prevalence over successive cohorts in developed 
and developing regions (Figure 4) reveal that successive cohorts appear to be gaining weight 
at all ages, including childhood and adolescence, with more rapid gains between ages 20-40 
years. In developed countries, peak prevalence is moving to earlier ages over time. Of note, 
among developed country women, the 1965 birth cohort appears to have lower prevalence at 
the same age than the 1960 birth cohort and the 1970 birth cohort also crosses the 1965 
cohort. Given uncertainty in the estimates (shown in Webtable 11), however, this cohort 
cross-over should not be over-interpreted. Prevalence in men and women decline as cohorts

age, possibly due to selective mortality effects or to higher rates of chronic disease at older 
age and associated weight loss.
Table 1 and Webtables 9-10 provide age-standardized regional and national estimates of the 
prevalence of overweight and obesity together and obesity alone for males and females for 
1980, 1990, 2000, and 2013 for 188 countries and 21 GBD regions. Figures 5A-D show 
maps of prevalence of obesity in 2013 for boys, girls, men, and women. Age-standardized 
prevalence of obesity in children and adolescents ranges from over 30% for girls in Kiribati, 
Samoa, and the Federated States of Micronesia to under 2% in Bangladesh, Brunei 
Darussalam, Burundi, Cambodia, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Laos, Nepal, North Korea, Tanzania, and 
Togo. There are distinct geographic patterns for child and adolescent obesity with high rates 
seen in many countries in the Middle-East and North Africa, particularly for girls, and in 
several Pacific Island and Caribbean nations for both girls and boys. Within Western Europe 
there is marked variation in rates of obesity from 12.5% (10.3-14.9) for boys in Malta to 4.1 
% (3.4-5.0) in the Netherlands. In Latin America, Chile and Mexico stand out with the 
highest levels for boys, at 11.9% (9.6-14.3) and 10.5% (8.8-12.4) respectively, and Uruguay 
and Costa Rica for girls, at 18.1% (14.9-21.9) and 12.4% (10.0-15.1) respectively.
Among adults, estimated prevalence of obesity exceeds 50% among men in Tonga and 
women in Kuwait, Kiribati, the Federated States of Micronesia, Libya, Qatar, Tonga, and 
Samoa. In North America, the USA stands out for its high prevalence of obesity, with 
roughly one-third of both men (31.6% [30.0-33.4]) and women (33.9% [31.8-35.7]) being 
obese. Fourteen countries in Central and Latin America have female age-standardized 
prevalence rates greater than 20%. In sub-Saharan Africa, the highest prevalence of obesity 
is observed among South African women, at 42.0% (40.6-43.3) in 2013. Despite increasing 
trends over time (data not shown), China and India show relatively low rates of obesity in 
2013, with 3.8% (3.5-4.3) of Chinese men and 5.0% (4.5-5.5) of women, and 3.7% (3.3-4.1) 
of Indian men and 4.2% (3.8-4.8) of Indian women being obese in 2013. More than 50% of 
the 693 million obese individuals in the world live in just 10 countries (listed in order of 
number of obese individuals): USA, China, India, Russia, Brazil, Mexico, Egypt, Pakistan, 
Indonesia, and Germany. The USA accounted for 13% of obese people worldwide in 2013, 
with China and India jointly accounting for another 15%. Although age-standardized rates 
are lower in developing than developed countries overall, 64% of the world’s obese live in 
developing countries.
The correlation across countries between the level of obesity in 1980 and the change since 
then is 0.29 for women and 0.38 for men. This suggests that the long-term (three decades) 
increases in obesity have not been smaller for countries that already had higher rates of 
obesity in 1980. Over the 33-year period of this study, the largest increases in the rate of 
obesity were seen in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Honduras, and Bahrain, for women, and 
for New Zealand, Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the USA for men. The USA was 
among the top fifteen countries in terms of increases in obesity for both men and women. 
Other high-income countries with large gains during this time period include Australia and 
the United Kingdom.

Discussion
In our systematic analysis of global data on the prevalence of obesity and overweight, we 
find that the prevalence of overweight and obesity has risen significantly over the past three 
decades, with marked variations across countries in the levels and trends in overweight and 
obesity with distinct regional patterns. In developed countries, there is some indication that 
the increases in obesity that began in the 1980s have attenuated over the last eight years or 
so. Conversely, our findings suggest that there are likely to be continued increases in the 
developing world, where almost two in three of the world’s obese live. Island nations in the 
Pacific and the Caribbean, and countries in the Middle-East and Central America, have 
already reached particularly high rates of overweight and obesity.
Attempts to explain the large increases in obesity over the past 33 years have focused on a 
number of potential contributors, including increases in calorie intake, changes in the 
composition of diet, declining levels of physical activity, and changes in the gut 
microbiome.44,46–56 The relative contribution of changes in energy intake versus energy 
expenditure has been vigorously debated.52–55 More recent experimental evidence on the 
importance of the microbiome for metabolism of energy57,58 has led to alternative theories 
on the role of changing microbiome in the global obesity epidemic.59,60 Our descriptive 
analysis does not attempt to measure the relative contribution of these, or other factors. It 
does, however, demonstrate that increases in the prevalence of overweight and obesity have 
been substantial, and widespread, and have occurred over a relatively short period of time. 
Theories of change need to encompass this temporal dimension and dispersion.
Our analysis has highlighted countries where the majority of the adult female population and 
over a third of the adult male population are obese. We have found no countries where there 
have been significant declines over the last 33 years. This raises the question as to whether 
many or most countries are on a trajectory to reach the high levels of obesity observed in 
countries such as Tonga or Kuwait. Evidence of a slowdown in the rate of increase of 
overweight and obesity in the developed world, and indications that obesity in more recent 
birth cohorts is lower than prior birth cohorts at the same age, provides some hope that the 
epidemic may have peaked in developed countries and that populations in other countries 
may not reach the very high rates of over 40% currently seen in some developing countries. 
Wide variation in rates of increase in obesity and overweight among countries starting at the 
same initial level also suggests that there is substantial scope to modulate weight gain in 
populations. Our analysis, however, does not indicate why some countries have seen slower 
rates of increase, only that smaller increases are possible.
The health effects of overweight and obesity have been extensively debated.61–65 Large 
pooling studies used for the GBD 2013, however, show consistent risks as BMI rises above 
23,66–69 particularly for cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, osteoarthritis, and chronic 
kidney disease. The majority of deaths attributable to overweight- and obesity are 
cardiovascular deaths.9 Systematic reviews suggest that only 31% of the coronary heart 
disease risk and 8% of the stroke mortality risk associated with obesity is mediated through 
elevated blood pressure and cholesterol collectively.70 Pharmacotherapy targeting blood 
pressure and cholesterol can thus be expected to attenuate some, but not the majority of the 
et al.

cardiovascular risk attributable to overweight and obesity. Even with aggressive 
pharmacotherapy, we can therefore expect that rising overweight and obesity will have 
substantial health effects, driving up diabetes, osteoarthrisits, cancers, and major vascular 
disease.
This study has important limitations. First, we have chosen to include surveys that collect 
self-reported weights and heights. In our analysis (see Webappendix) we have found that 
there is systematic bias but this bias is greater in some regions such as high-income 
countries and the Middle-East than in low-income countries. We have corrected the self-
reported data using the relationships observed in data from country-years with both self-
report and measured weights and heights. The sensitivity analysis reported in the 
Webappendix shows that our overall global results are robust to the exclusion of these data 
(correlation coefficient = 0.96). Second, we have chosen to exclude sub-national studies 
from a limited number of sites. For example, MONICA data points were excluded because 
they pertained to a single city.71 By examining national surveys with individual records and 
information on location we found that there is marked variation between urban and rural 
areas and heterogeneity across urban sites (data not shown). We were unable to generalize 
the bias for selected cities to national figures. Moreover, reporting national level rates of 
overweight and obesity undoubtedly obscures important subnational variations, particularly 
among ethnic groups, lower socioeconomic categories and important sub-populations (e.g. 
slums) in large cities. Third, there is substantial data sparseness particularly in the 1980s 
(see Webappendix). The estimation of prevalence for the earlier time period in this study is 
based on extrapolation from the model which is strongly influenced by the kcal per capita 
covariate. Kcal per capita are reported through food balance sheets of the Food and 
Agriculture Organization. To the extent that these are inaccurate, our trends will be biased. 
Of note, we did not include time as a covariate in our model because this inappropriately 
imposes a similar time trend on all countries. Nevertheless, we have attempted to capture 
temporal associations among data using spatio-temporal smoothing. Fourth, our uncertainty 
intervals may be under-estimated because we have not included uncertainty from the 
selection of GPR hyper parameters in our final results. However, our cross-validation 
analysis suggests that this is unlikely to be a major problem (see Webappendix). Fifth, 
definitions of childhood obesity vary between the International Obesity Task Force and 
WHO. We have chosen to apply a consistent definition of obesity and overweight across 
sources; for this reason, we have excluded a number of published studies from our analysis 
that were reported using non-standard definitions. Where we could, we estimated 
overweight and obesity rates from individual-level records in household surveys. Sixth, 
although BMI serves as a convenient measure for adiposity, it does not adequately take into 
account variations in body structure across ethnic groups.72 Moreover, the use of the 
universal cutoff may underestimate the actual prevalence of overweight and obesity in 
certain countries.
Contrary to other major global risks such as tobacco42 and childhood malnutrition73,74 
which are declining globally, obesity is not. As shown in this study, obesity is already a 
major public health challenge in many middle-income countries. Tracking this important 
risk to health with increased precision and disaggregation in both developing and developed 
countries is a key global health priority. Options for population level surveillance of the

epidemic need to take into account more complex measurement strategies than required for 
other major hazards, such as tobacco. In particular, countries will need to carefully weigh 
the choice between fielding physical examination surveys that are more costly but can 
provide robust measurements, and using more routine survey platforms to collect self-
reported weights and heights. A combination of both approaches which allow for periodic 
assessment of self-report bias, such as used in the United States, United Kingdom, and 
Japan, may provide a reasonable approach.
Strengthened surveillance is not only good public health practice, but can be expected to 
increase public, including government awareness of the extent of the problem in countries. 
There is some evidence that this is already happening.75 Member States of WHO in 2013 
adopted a target of halting the rise in obesity by 2025.11 While this resolution is 
commendable evidence that the global public health community is taking the rise in obesity 
seriously, there are no countries with well documented downward trends in the last three 
decades. Our analysis, moreover, suggests that this target is extremely ambitious and 
unlikely to be attained without concerted action and further research to evaluate the impact 
of population wide interventions, and how to effectively translate that knowledge into 
national obesity control programs.
To counter the impending health effects on populations, particularly in the developing 
world, urgent global leadership is required to assist countries to more effectively intervene 
against major determinants such as excessive caloric intake, physical inactivity and active 
promotion of food consumption by industry, all of which exacerbate an already problematic 
obesogenic environment.
