PURPOSE: To determine the extent to which the Task and Ego Orientation Sport
Questionnaire (based on the Achievement Goal Theory) is equivalent in both
adaptations in the Spanish language (Spanish and Mexican athletes) and to examine
the differences in the latent means between both countries.
 
METHOD: 1116 young athletes participated in the study, 563 were Spanish and 553
were Mexican. Ages ranged between 11 and 18 years in both samples.
 
RESULTS: The internal consistency is considered suitable for both Mexican and
Spanish athletes. The NNFI, CFI and RMSEA adjustment indices for models M1 (Mexican
athletes) and M2 (Spanish athletes) were suitable. The invariance was demonstrated
in the structure, factor loading and intercepts. The invariance between latent means
was not confirmed. When the invariance of the latent means was not confirmed, the
differences between the latent means of the two groups were estimated. Significant
differences were found between the two groups relating to the ego factor (p<.01).
 
CONCLUSION: Evidence of transcultural validation of the TEOSQ in two different
cultural contexts sharing the same language (Spain and Mexico) was demonstrated.
Furthermore, the two versions of the TEOSQ have turned out to be reliable and valid
for transcultural comparisons between populations of athletes in both countries. Ego
orientation is significantly greater in Mexican athletes.
