Abstract. This paper summarizes
the author's recently published findings about differences
in people's
work-related values among 50 countries.
In view of these differences,
ethnocen-
tric management
theories (those based on the value system
of one particular country) have
become
untenable. This concept
is illustrated for the fields of leadership,
organization,
and
motivation.
*
A key issue
for organization
science
is the influence
of national cultures
on
INTRODUCTION
management.
Twenty or even 10 years ago, the existence
of a relationship
be-
Management and
tween management
and national cultures
was far from obvious
to many, and it
National Cultures
may not be obvious to everyone even now. In the 1950s and 60s, the dominant be-
lief, at least in Europe and the U.S., was that management
was something
univer-
sal. There were principles of sound management,
which existed
regardless
of na-
tional environments.
If national or local practice deviated from these principles, it
was time to change local practice. Inthe future, the universality of sound manage-
ment practices
would lead to societies
becoming
more and more alike. This ap-
plied even to the poor countries
of the Third World, which would become
rich as
well and would be managed just like the rich countries.
Also, the differences
be-
tween management
in the First and Second World (capitalist
and socialist)
would
disappear;
in fact, under the surface
they were thought to be a lot smaller than
was officially
recognized.
This way of thinking, which dominated
the 1950s and
60s, is known as the "convergence
hypothesis."
During the 1970s, the belief in the unavoidable convergence
of management
prac-
tices waned. It was too obviously
in conflict with the reality we saw around us. At
the same
time supranational
organizations
like the European Common Market,
which were founded very much on the convergence
belief, had to recognize
the
stubbornness
of national differences.
Even within existing
nations,
regional dif-
ferences
became
more rather than less accentuated.
The Welsh, the Flemish, the
Basques,
the Bangladeshi,
the Quebecois
defended
their own identity, and this
was difficult to reconcile with a management
philosophy of convergence.
Itslowly
became clear that national and even regional cultures do matter for management.
The national and regional differences
are not disappearing;
they are here to stay.
In fact, these differences
may become one of the most crucial problems for man-
agement-in
particular for the management
of multinational,
multicultural orga-
nizations,
whether public or private.
Nationality is important to management
for at least 3 reasons. The first, very obvi-
The Importance
ously, is political. Nations are political units, rooted in history, with their own insti-
of Nationality
tutions: forms of government,
legal systems,
educational
systems,
labor and em-
ployer's association
systems.
Not only do the formal institutions
differ, but even if
we could equalize them, the informal ways of using them differ. For example, for-
mal law in France protects the rights of the individual against the state much bet-
ter than formal law in Great Britain or Holland. However, few French citizens
have
ever won court cases
against
the state, whereas
this happens
quite regularly in
Holland or Britain. Such informal political realities are quite resistant
to change.

The second
reason why nationality is important is sociological.
Nationality or re-
gionality has a symbolic value to citizens. We all derive part of our identity from it;
it is part of the 'who am L."The symbolic value of the fact of belonging to a nation
or region has been and still is sufficient
reason for people to go to war, when they
feel their common identity to be threatened.
National and regional differences
are
felt by people to be a reality-and
therefore they are a reality.
The third reason why nationality
is important is psychological.
Our thinking is
partly conditioned
by national culture factors. This is an effect of early life experi-
ences
in the family and later educational
experiences
in schools
and organiza-
tions, which are not the same across
national borders. Ina classroom.
Ican easily
demonstrate
the process
of conditioning
by experience.
For this purpose I use an
ambiguous
picture: one that can be interpreted in 2 different ways. One such pic-
ture represents either an attractive young girl or an ugly old woman, depending on
the way you look at it. In order to demonstrate
the process
of conditioning,
I ask
one half of the class
to close their eyes. To the other half. I show for 5 seconds
a
slightly changed
version of the picture, in which only the young girl can be seen.
Then Iask the other half to close their eyes, and to the first half I show, also for 5
seconds,
a version in which only the old woman can be seen. After this prepara-
tion, I show the ambiguous
picture to everyone at the same time. The results are
amazing: the vast majority of those
"conditioned"
by seeing
the young girl first,
now see only the young girl in the ambiguous
picture; and most of those "condi-
tioned" by seeing
the old woman first can see only the old woman afterwards.
Mental
This very simple experiment shows that, as a teacher, Ican in 5 seconds
condition
Programming
a randomly taken half of a class to see something
else in a picture than would the
other half. Ifthis is so, how much stronger should the differences
in perception of
the same reality be between people who have been "conditioned" by different edu-
cational and life experiences
not for a mere 5 seconds,
but for 20, 30, or 40 years?
Through our experiences
we become "mentally programmed" to interpret new ex-
periences
in a certain way. My favorite definition of "culture" is precisely that its
essence
is collective
mental programming: it is that part of our conditioning
that
we share with other members of our nation, region, or group but not with members
of other nations, regions, or groups.
Examples
of differences
in mental programming between
members
of different
nations can be observed all around us. One source of difference
is, of course, lan-
guage and all that comes with it, but there is much more. In Europe, British people
wiil form a neat queue whenever they have to wait; not so, the French. Dutch peo-
ple will as a rule greet strangers when they enter a small, closed
space
like a rail-
way compartment,
doctor's waiting room, or lift; not so, the Belgians.
Austrians
will wait at a red pedestrian
traffic light even when there is no traffic; not so the
Dutch. Swiss
tend to become
very angry when somebody-say,
a foreigner-
makes a mistake in traffic; not so the Swedes. All these are part of an invisible set
of mental programs which belongs to these countries'
national cultures.
Such cultural programs are difficult to change, unless one detaches
the individual
from his or her culture. Within a nation or a part of it, culture changes
only slowly.
This is the more so because
what is in the minds of the people has also become
crystallized
in the institutions
mentioned earlier: government,
legal systems,
edu-
cational systems,
industrial relations systems,
family structures,
religious organi-
zations, sports clubs, settlement
patterns, literature, architecture,
and even scien-
tific theories. All these reflect traditions and common ways of thinking, which are
rooted in the common culture but may be different for other cultures. The institu-
tions constrain
and reinforce the ways of thinking on which they are based. One
well-known mechanism
by which culturally determined ways of thinking perpetu-
ate themselves
is the self-fulfilling prophecy. If,for example, the belief is held that
76
Journalof InternationalBusiness Studies, Fall 1983

----- Page 3 (native) -----
people from a certain minority are irresponsible,
the institutions
in such an envi-
ronment will not admit these
people into positions
of responsibility:
never being
given responsibility,
minority people will be unable to learn it, and very likely they
will actually
behave
irresponsibly.
So, everyone
remains
caught
in the belief-
including, probably, the minority people themselves.
Another example of the self-
fulfilling prophecy: if the dominant way of thinking in a society
is that all people
are ultimately motivated by self-interest,
those who do not pursue self-interest
are
considered
as deviant. As it is unpleasant
to be a deviant, most people in such an
environment
will justify whatever they want to do with some
reference
to self-
interest, thereby reinforcing the dominant way of thinking. People in such a soci-
ety cannot even imagine motives that cannot be reduced to self-interest.
This paper shall be limited to national cultures, excluding cultural differences
be-
National
tween groups within nations; such as, those based on regions, social classes,
oc-
Character
cupations,
religion, age, sex, or even families. These differences
in culture within
nations,
of course,
do exist,
but for most nations
we can still distinguish
some
ways of thinking that most inhabitants
share and that we can consider
part of
their national culture or national character.
National characters
are more clearly
distinguishable
to foreigners
than to the nationals
themselves.
When we live
within a country, we do not discover what we have in common with our compatri-
ots, only what makes us different from them.
Statements
about national
culture or national
character
smell of superficiality
and false generalization.
There are 2 reasons
for this. First, there is no commonly
accepted
language
to describe
such a complex thing as a "culture." We meet the
same problem if we want to describe
someone's
"personality": we risk being sub-
jective and superficial.
In the case
of "personality,"
however, psychology
has at
least
developed
terms
like intelligence,
energy
level, introversion-extroversion
and emotional stability, to mention a few, which are more or less commonly under-
stood.
In the case
of "culture," such a scientific
language
does
not exist.
In the
second
place, statements
about national character have often been based on im-
pressions
only, not on systematic
study. Such statements
can indeed be consid-
ered false generalizations.
My own research into national cultures was carried out between 1967 and 1978. It
A RESEARCH
has attempted
to meet the 2 objectives
Ijust mentioned: to develop a commonly
PROJECT
acceptable,
well-defined,
and empirically based terminology
to describe
cultures,
ACROSS 50
and to use systematically
collected
data about a large number of cultures, rather
COUNTRIES
than just impressions.
Iobtained these data more or less by accident.
From 1967
to 1971 I worked as a psychologist
on the international
staff of a large multina-
tional corporation. As part of my job I collected
data on the employees'
attitudes
and values,
by means of standardized
paper-and-pencil
questionnaires.
Virtual"y
all employees
of the corporation
were surveyed,
from unskilled
workers to -e-
search scientists
in many countries
around the globe. Then from 1971 to 1973 the
surveys were repeated once more with the same group of employees.
All in all the
corporation collected
over 116,000 questionnaires
which were stored in a comput-
erized data
bank. For 40 countries,
there were sufficient
data for systematic
analysis.
It soon appeared that those
items in the questionnaires
that dealt with employee
values
rather than attitudes
showed
remarkable and very stable
differences
be-
tween countries.
By an attitude Imean the response
to a question
like "how do you
like your job?" or "how do you like your boss?" By a value Imean answers to ques-
tions of whether people prefer one type of boss over another, or their choice of fac-
tors to describe an ideal job. Values indicate their desires,
not their perceptions
of

what actually went on. These values, not the attitudes,
reflect differences
in men-
tal programming and national character.
These
differences,
however, were always
statistical
in nature. Suppose
people
were asked whether they strongly agreed, agreed, were undecided,
disagreed,
or
strongly disagreed
with a certain value statement.
In such a case
we would not
find that all employees
in country A agreed and all in country B disagreed;
instead
we might find that 60 percent of the employees
in country A agreed, while only 40
percent in country B agreed. Characterizing a national culture does not mean that
every individual within that culture is mentally programmed in the same way. The
national culture found is a kind of average pattern of beliefs
and values, around
which individuals in the country vary. For example, Ifound that, on average, Japa-
nese have a greater desire for a strong authority than English; but some English
have a greater desire for a strong authority than quite a few Japanese.
In describ-
ing national cultures
we refer to common
elements
within each
nation, but we
should not generalize
to every individual within that nation.
In 1971 Iwent as a teacher to an international business
school, where Iasked the
course participants, who were managers from many different countries,
to answer
the same vaiues questions
we used in the multinational corporation. The answers
reveaied the same type of pattern of differences
between countries,
showing that
we were not dealing with a phenomenon
particular to this one company. Then in
my later research, from 1973 to 1979, at the European Institute for Advanced Stud-
ies in Brussels,
Ilooked for other studies comparing aspects
of national character
across
countries.
I found about 40 such studies
comparing
5 or more countries
which showed differences
confirming the ones found in the multinational
corpora-
tion. All this material together
forms the basis
for my book Culture's
Conse-
quences
[Hofstede 1980]. Later, supplementary
data became available for another
10 countries and 3 multi-country regions, thereby raising the total number of coun-
tries to 50 [Hofstede
1983].
FOUR
My terminology
for describing
national cultures
consists
of 4 different criteria
DIMENSIONSOF
which Icall "dimensions"
because
they occur in nearly all possible
combinations.
NATIONAL They are largely independent
of each other:
CULTURE
1. Individualism versus Collectivism;
2. Large or Small Power Distance;
3. Strong or Weak Uncertainty Avoidance; and
4. Masculinity versus Femininity.
The research data have allowed me to attribute to each of the 40 countries
repre-
sented in the data bank of the multinational corporation an index value (between 0
and about 100) on each of these 4 dimensions.
The 4 dimensions
were found through a combination
of multivariate
statistics
(factor analysis) and theoretical
reasoning. The cases
analysed
in the factor anal-
ysis were the 40 countries; the variables were the mean scores or answer percent-
ages for the different value questions,
as produced by the multinational
corpora-
tion's employees
within these countries. This factor analysis
showed that 50 per-
cent of the variance in answer patterns between countries on the value questions
could be explained
by 3 factors, corresponding
to the dimensions
1 + 2, 3 and 4.
Theoretical
reasoning
led to the further splitting of the first factor into 2 dimen-
sions. The theoretical
reasoning
meant that each dimension
should be conceptu-
ally linkable to some very fundamental
problem in human societies,
but a problem
to which different societies
have found different answers.
These are the issues
studied in primitive, nonliterate societies
by cultural anthropologists,
such as, the
distribution of power, or the distribution of roles between the sexes.
There is no
reason why such issues
should be relevant only for primitive societies.

The first dimension
is labeled
"Individualism versus
Collectivism."
The funda-
Individualism-
mental issue involved is the relation between an individual and his or her fellow in-
Collectivism
dividuals. At one end of the scale we find societies
in which the ties between indi-
viduals are very loose.
Everybody is supposed
to look after his or her own self-
interest and maybe the interest of his or her immediate family. This is made possi-
ble by a large amount of freedom that such a society
leaves
individuals.
At the
other end of the scale we find societies
in which the ties between
individuals are
very tight. People are born into collectivities
or ingroups which may be their ex-
tended family (including grandparents,
uncles,
aunts,
and so on), their tribe, or
their village. Everybody is supposed
to look after the interest of his or her ingroup
and to have no other opinions and beliefs than the opinions and beliefs in their in-
group. Inexchange,
the ingroup will protect them when they are in trouble. We see
that both the Individualist and the Collectivist
society
are integrated wholes,
but
the Individualist society
is loosely
integrated, and the Collectivist
society
tightly
integrated.
All 50 countries
studied
can
be placed
somewhere
along
the
Individualist-
Collectivist
scale.
On the basis of the answers
obtained on the questionnaire
in
the multinational
corporation,
each
country was
given an Individualism
index
score. The score is such that 100 represents
a strongly Individualist society,
and 0
a strongly
Collectivist
society:
all 50 countries
are somewhere
between
these
extremes.
It appears that the degree of Individualism in a country is statistically
related to
that country's
wealth.

shows
vertically the Individualism Index scores
of the 50 countries,
and horizon-
tally their wealth, expressed
in their gross national product per capita at the time
the surveys were taken (around 1970). We see evidence that wealthy countries
are
more Individualist and poor countries
more Collectivist.
Very Individualist coun-
tries are the U.S., Great Britain, the Netherlands;
very Collectivist
are Colombia,
Pakistan, and Taiwan. In the middle we find Japan, India, Austria, and Spain.
The second
dimension
is labeled
"Power Distance."
The fundamental
issue
in-
Power Distance
volved is how society
deals with the fact that people are unequal. People are un-
equal in physical
and intellectual
capacities.
Some societies
let these
unequali-
ties grow over time into inequalities
in power and wealth; the latter may become
hereditary and no longer related to physical
and intellectual
capacities
at all.
Other societies
try to play down inequalities
in power and wealth as much as pos-
sible. Surely, no society
has ever reached complete
equality,
because
there are
strong forces in society
that perpetuate existing
inequalities.
All societies
are un-
equal, but some are more unequal than others. This degree of inequality is mea-
sured by the Power Distance
scale, which also runs from 0 (small Power Distance)
to 100 (large Power Distance).
In organizations,
the level of Power Distance
is related to the degree of centraliza-
tion of authority and the degree of autocratic
leadership. This relationship
shows
that centralization
and autocratic
leadership
are rooted in the "mental program-
ming" of the members of a society,
not only of those in power but also of those at
the bottom of the power hierarchy. Societies
in which power tends to be distrib-
uted unequally can remain so because
this situation
satisfies
the psychological
need for dependence
of the people without power. We could also say that socie-
ties and organizations
will be led as autocratically
as their members will permit.
The autocracy exists just as much in the members as in the leaders: the value sys-
tems of the 2 groups are usually complementary.
In Figure 3 Power Distance
is plotted horizontally and Individualism-Collectivism
vertically. The Philippines,
Venezuela,
India, and others
show
large Power Dis-
tance
index scores,
but also France and Belgium score fairly high. Denmark, Is-
rael, and Austria score
low. We see that there is a global relationship
between
Power Distance
and Collectivism:
Collectivist
countries always show large Power
Distances,
but Individualist countries do not always show small Power Distances.
The Latin European countries-France,
Belgium, Italy, and Spain, plus marginally
South Africa-show
a combination
of large Power Distances
plus Individualism.
The other wealthy Western countries
all combine smaller Power Distance
with In-
dividualism. All poor countries
are Collectivist
with larger Power Distances.
The third dimension
is labeled "Uncertainty Avoidance." The fundamental
issue
Uncertainty
involved here is how society
deals with the fact that time runs only one way; that
Avoidance
is, we are all caught in the reality of past, present and future, and we have to live
with uncertainty because
the future is unknown and always will be. Some socie-
ties socialize
their members into accepting
this uncertainty and not becoming
up-
set by it. People in such societies
will tend to accept each day as it comes.
They
will take risks rather easily. They will not work as hard. They will be relatively toler-
ant of behavior and opinions
different from their own because
they do not feel
threatened
by them. Such societies
can be called "weak Uncertainty Avoidance"
societies;
they are societies
in which people have a natural tendency
to feel rela-
tively secure.
Other societies
socialize
their people into trying to beat the future. Because
the fu-
ture remains essentially
unpredictable,
in those
societies
there will be a higher
level of anxiety in people, which becomes
manifest
in greater nervousness,

tionality, and aggressiveness.
Such societies,
called "strong Uncertainty Avoid-
ance" societies,
also have institutions
that try to create security and avoid risk.
We can create security in 3 ways. One is technology,
in the broadest sense
of the
word. Through technology
we protect ourselves
from the risks of nature and war.
We build houses,
dikes, power stations,
and ICBMs which are meant to give us a
feeling of security. The second
way of creating security is law, again in the broad-
est sense
of the word. Through laws and all kinds of formal rules and institutions,
we protect ourselves
from the unpredictability
of human behavior. The prolifera-
tion of laws and rules implies an intolerance
of deviant behaviours and opinions.
Where laws cannot be made because
the subject is too fuzzy, we can create a feel-
ing of security
by the nomination
of experts.
Experts are people whose
word we
accept
as a kind of law because
we assume
them to be beyond uncertainty. The
third way of creating a feeling of security is religion, once more in the broadest
sense
of the word. This sense
includes
secular religions and ideologies,
such as
Marxism, dogmatic
Capitalism,
or movements
that preach an escape
into medita-
tion. Even science
is included. All human societies
have their religions
in some
way or another. All religions,
in some way, make uncertainty
tolerable,
because
they all contain a message
that is beyond uncertainty, that helps us to accept the
uncertainty of today because
we interpret experiences
in terms of something
big-
ger and more powerful that transcends
personal
reality. In strongly
Uncertainty
Avoiding societies
we find religions which claim absolute
truth and which do not
tolerate other religions. We also find in such societies
a scientific
tradition look-
ing for ultimate, absolute
truths, as opposed
to a more relativist, empiricist
tradi-
tion in the weak Uncertainty Avoidance societies.
The Uncertainty Avoidance dimension,
thus, implies a number of things, from ag-
gressiveness
to a need for absolute
truth, that we do not usually consider
as be-
longing together. They appear to belong together in the logic of culture patterns,
but this logic differs from our own daily logic. Without research we would not have
found that, on the level of societies,
these things go together.
Figure 4 plots the Uncertainty Avoidance index for 50 countries
along the vertical
axis, against
the Power Distance
index on the horizontal axis. We find several
clusters
of countries. There is a large cluster of countries
with strong Uncertainty
Avoidance and large Power Distance.
They are: all the Latin countries,
both Latin
European
and Latin American;
Mediterranean
countries,
such
as, Yugoslavia,
Greece, and Turkey; and Japan plus Korea.
The Asian countries are found in 2 clusters with large Power Distance and medium
to weak Uncertainty Avoidance. Then we find a cluster of German-speaking
coun-
tries, including
Israel and marginally
Finland, combining
small Power Distance
with medium to strong Uncertainty Avoidance.
Both small Power Distance
and weak Uncertainty Avoidance
are found in Den-
mark, Sweden,
Great Britain, and Ireland, while the Netherlands,
U.S., Norway,
and the other Anglo countries
are in the middle.
The fourth dimension
is labeled "Masculinity versus Femininity." The fundamen-
Masculinity-
tal issue
involved is the division of roles between the sexes
in society.
All socie-
Femininity
ties have to deal with the basic fact that one half of mankind is female and the
other male. The only activities
that are strictly determined
by the sex of a person
are those related to procreation. Men cannot have babies. Human societies,
how-
ever, through the ages and around the globe, have also associated
other roles to
men only, or to women only. This is called social,
rather than biological,
sex role
division.
All social
role divisions
are more or less arbitrary, and what is seen as a typical
task for men or for women can vary from one society to the other. We can classify
societies
on whether they try to minimize or to maximize the social
sex role divi-

sion. Some societies
allow both men and women to take many different roles. Oth-
ers make a sharp division between what men should do and what women should
do. In this latter case, the distribution
is always such that men take the more as-
sertive and dominant roles and women the more service-oriented
and caring roles.
Ihave called those societies
with a maximized social sex role division "Masculine,"
and those with a relatively small social sex role division "Feminine." In Masculine
societies,
the traditional
masculine
social
values
permeate
the whole society-
even the way of thinking of the women. These values
include the importance
of
showing
off, of performing, of achieving
something
visible, of making money, of
"big is beautiful." In more Feminine societies,
the dominant values-for
both men
and women-are
those
more traditionally associated
with the feminine
role: not
showing off, putting relationships
with people before money, minding the quality
of life and the preservation
of the environment,
helping others,
in particular the
weak, and "small is beautiful." In a masculine
society,
the public hero is the suc-
cessful
achiever, the superman.
In a more Feminine society,
the public sympathy
goes to the anti-hero, the underdog. Individual brilliance in a Feminine society
is
suspect.
Following the procedure used for the other dimensions,
each of the 50 countries
was
given an index score
on the Masculinity-Femininity
scale:
a high score
means a more Masculine, a low score a more Feminine country. Figure 5 plots the
Masculinity
index score
horizontally and the Uncertainty Avoidance
index again
vertically. The most
Masculine
country is Japan; also
quite Masculine
are the
German-speaking
countries: Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.
Moderately Mas-
culine are a number of Latin countries,
such as Venezuela,
Mexico, and Italy; also
the entire cluster of Anglo countries
including some of their former colonies:
India
and the Philippines.
On the far end towards the Feminine side we find the 4 Nordic countries
and the
Netherlands.
Some Latin and Mediterranean countries
like Yugoslavia,
Chile, Por-
tugal, Spain, and France are moderately
Feminine.
The naive assumption
that management
is the same
or is becoming
the same
SOMECONSE
around the world is not tenable
in view of these demonstrated
differences
in na-
QUENCESFOR
tional cultures. Consider a few of the ideas about management
which have been
MANAGEMENT
popularized in the Western literature in the past 15 years; in particular, about lead-
THEORYAND
ership, about models of organization,
and about motivation. These theories
were
PRACTICE
almost without exception
made in the U.S.; in fact, the post-World War IImanage-
ment literature is entirely U.S. dominated. This reflects the economic
importance
of the U.S. during this period, but culturally the U.S. is just one country among all
others, with its particular configuration
of cultural values which differs from that
of most other countries.
The most relevant dimensions
for leadership
are Individualism
and Power Dis-
Leadership
tance. Let us look at Figure 3 again. We find the U.S. in an extreme position on the
Individualism scale
(50 out of 50) and just below average on the Power Distance
scale (16 out of 50). What does the high Individualism score mean? U.S. leadership
theories
are about leading individuals based on the presumed
needs of individu-
als who seek their ultimate self-interest.
For example, the word "duty," which im-
plies obligations
towards others or towards society,
does not appear at all in the
U.S. leadership theories.
Leadership
in a Collectivist
society-basically
any Third World country-is
a
group phenomenon.
A working group which is not the same as the natural ingroup
will have to be made into another ingroup in order to be effective.
People in these
countries
are able to bring considerable
loyalty to their job, providing they feel
that the employer returns the loyalty in the form of protection, just like their natu-
ral ingroup does.

Let us now look at the Power Distance dimension,
in terms of participative leader-
ship. What does participative
leadership
U.S. style mean?
Individual subordinates
are allowed to participate
in the leader's decisions,
but
these remain the leader's decisions;
it is the leader who keeps the initiative. Man-
agement
prerogatives
are very important in the U.S. Let us remember that on
Power Distance,
the U.S. is more or less
in the middle zone. In countries
with
higher Power Distances-such
as, many Third World countries,
but also
France
and Belgium-individual
subordinates
as a rule do not want to participate.
It is
part of their expectations
that leaders lead autocratically,
and such subordinates
will, in fact, by their own behavior make it difficult for leaders to lead in any other
way. There is very little participative leadership in France and Belgium. Ifthe soci-
ety is at the same time Collectivist,
however, there will be ways by which subordi-
nates in a group can still influence the leader. This applies to all Asian countries.
Let us take some countries
on the other side, however: Denmark, Sweden,
or Is-
rael. In this case, subordinates
will not necessarily
wait until their boss takes the
initiative to let them participate. They will, for example, support forms of employee
codetermination
in which either individuals or groups can take initiatives towards
management.
In these
cultures
there are no management
prerogatives
that are
automatically
accepted;
anything a boss
does
may be challenged
by the subor-
dinates.
Management
privileges
in particular are much more easily
accepted
in
U.S. than in some of the very low Power Distance
countries.
A similar difference
is found
in the
ratios
between
management
compensation
and subordinate
compensation.
In organizations
the decisive
dimensions
of culture are Power Distance
and Un-
Organization
certainty Avoidance. Organizations
are devices
to distribute power, and they also
serve to avoid uncertainty, to make things predictable.
So let us look at Figure 4
again. My former colleague,
Professor
James
Stevens
from INSEAD, once gave
the same description
of an organizational
problem to separate
groups of French,
West German, and British management
students.
The problem described
a con-
flict between
2 departments.
The students
were asked
to determine
what was
wrong and what should be done to resolve the problem. The French in majority re-
ferred the problem to the next higher authority level. The Germans suggested
the
setting
of rules to resolve such problems in the future. The British wanted to im-
prove communications
between the 2 department heads, perhaps by some kind of
human relations
training. My colleague
concluded
that the dominant
underlying
model of an organization
for the French was a pyramid, a hierarchical
structure
held together by the unity of command (larger Power Distance) as well as by rules
(strong Uncertainty Avoidance). The model for the Germans was a well-oiled ma-
chine; the exercise
of personal
command
was largely unnecessary
because
the
rules settled
everything
(strong Uncertainty
Avoidance,
but smaller
Power Dis-
tance). The model for the British was a village market: no decisive
hierarchy, flex-
ible rules, and a resolution of problems by negotiating
(small Power Distance
and
weak Uncertainty Avoidance). These models left one corner in the diagram of Fig-
ure 4 unexplained,
but a discussion
with an Indian colleague
led me to believe that
the underlying model of an organization
for the Indians is the family: undisputed
personal authority of the father-leader but few formal rules (large Power Distance
and weak Uncertainty Avoidance). This should also apply in the Chinese
culture
city-states
of Hong Kong and Singapore (see Figure 4).
The U.S. is close
to the center of the diagram of Figure 4 and so are the Nether-
lands and Switzerland. This may explain something
of the success
of U.S., Dutch,
and Swiss multinationals
in operating in a variety of cultures; in the U.S. literature
and practice, all 4 models of organization-the
pyramid, the well-oiled
machine,
the village market, and the family-can
be found, but none of them can be consid-
ered dominant.

Motivation
The theories of motivation (what makes people act) and the practices
of motivat-
ing people can both be related to the Individualism-Collectivism
dimension.
Inthe
U.S., the highest motivation is supposed
to stem from the individuals' need to ful-
fill their obligations
towards themselves.
We find terms like "self-actualization'
and "self-respect"
on the top of the list of motivators. In a more Collectivist
soci-
ety, however, people will try primarily to fulfill their obligations
towards their in-
group. This may be their family, but their collective
loyalty may also be directed to-
wards some larger unit: their enterprise, or their country. Such people do not seek
self-actualization
or self-respect,
but they primarily seek "face" in their relation-
ships with ingroup members. The importance of face as a motivator does not ap-
pear in the U.S. motivation
literature at all. The distinction
between
"face" cul-
tures and "self-respect"
cultures
is similar to the distinction
between
"shame"
and "guilt" cultures identified by the anthropologist
Ruth Benedict [1974].
Other dimensions
relevant to motivation are Uncertainty Avoidance and Masculin-
ity-Femininity.
Let us look at Figure 5 again. The dominant theme of the U.S. liter-
ature of the past 20 years is that people are basically
motivated
by a desire to
achieve something.
We should, therefore, allow our people to achieve: give them
challenge,
and enrich their jobs if they do not contain any challenge.
The idea of
"achievement"
and "challenge,"
U.S. style, implies 2 things: a willingness
to take
some risks (weak Uncertainty Avoidance) and a need to perform, to assert oneself
(Masculinity). It is therefore no wonder that in the diagram of Figure 5 we find the
U.S. in the weak Uncertainty Avoidance, Masculine corner. It shares this position
with the other Anglo countries.
Let us take the case of some
other countries, how-
ever: Japan or Germany. These are also Masculine countries but with stronger Un-
certainty Avoidance. This means that in these countries
there is less willingness
to take risks: security is a powerful motivator. People are very willing to perform if
they are offered security in exchange.
Interestingly, these
security-seeking
coun-
tries seem to have been doing better economically
in the past 20 years than the
risk takers; but the management
theories
that tell us that risk taking is a good
thing were made in the U.S. or Great Britain, not in Japan or Germany.
If we go to the other corner of Figure 5, we find the Netherlands
and the Nordic
countries
combining
weak Uncertainty
Avoidance
with a more Feminine
value
system.
Here, the maintenance
of good interpersonal
relations is a strong motiva-
tor, and people frown at competition
for performance.
In these countries
we meet
a powerful interpersonal
motivation which is missing
in the U.S. theories. There is
striking difference
in the forms of "humanization
of work" proposed
in the U.S.
and in Sweden: a stress
in the U.S. on creating possibilities
for individual perfor-
mance, but a stress
in Sweden on creating possibilities
for interpersonal
solidar-
ity. Inthe fourth corner of Figure 5, we find both security and interpersonal
motiva-
tion; Yugoslav worker self-management
contains
both elements.
We are far away
here from the motivation to achieve according to the U.S. style.
CONCLUSION: Both management
practitioners and management
theorists
over the past 80 years
THECULTURAL have been blind to the extent to which activities
like "management"
and "organiz-
RELATIVITY
OF
ing" are culturally dependent.
They are culturally dependent
because
managing
MANAGEMENT and organizing do not consist
of making or moving tangible objects,
but of manip-
ANDORGANIZA-
ulating symbols which have meaning to the people who are managed or organized.
TION PRACTICES
Because
the meaning
which we associate
with symbols
is heavily affected
by
AND THEORIES
what we have learned in our family, in our school,
in our work environment, and in
our society,
management
and organization
are penetrated
with culture from the
beginning to the end. Practice is usually wiser than theory, and if we see what ef-
fective organizations
in different cultures have done, we recognize that their lead-
ers did adapt foreign management
ideas to local cultural conditions.
This hap-

pened extremely
effectively
in Japan, where mainly U.S. management
theories
were taken over but in an adapted form. This adaptation
led to entirely new forms
of practice which in the Japanese
case were highly successful.
An example is the
Quality Control Circle, originally based on U.S. impulses
but adapted to the Japa-
nese uncertainty-avoiding,
semicollectivist
environment. The Quality Control Cir-
cle has been so effective
in Japan that now the Americans are bringing it back to
the U.S.; but it is doubtful whether most of its present U.S. protagonists
realize the
role that
Japanese
educational
and social
conditions
play in the
ability
of
Japanese
workers to function effectively
in a Quality Control Circle.
Not all other countries
have been as fortunate as Japan in that a successful
adap-
tation of American management
theories
and practices
could take place. In Eu-
rope but even more often in Third World countries,
foreign management
methods
and ideas were indiscriminately
imported as a part of "technology
transfer." The
evident failure of much of the international development
assistance
of the 60s and
70s is at least partly due to this lack of cultural sensitivity
in the transfer of man-
agement
ideas.
It has caused
enormous
economic
losses
and human suffering.
Free market capitalism
as practised
in the U.S., for example,
is an idea which is
deeply rooted historically and culturally in Individualism. "Everybody for himself"
is supposed
to lead to the highest common good, according to Adam Smith [1970].
Ifthis idea is forced upon a traditionally Collectivist
society,
it means that work or-
ganizations
will be created which do not offer to employees
the protection which
they expect to get in exchange
for their loyalty. The system
itself in such a society
breeds disloyal, irresponsible
employees.
Japan has not taken over this aspect
of
capitalism
and has maintained a much higher level of protection of employees
by
their organization.
Many U.S. managers
and politicians
have great problems with
recognizing that their type of capitalism
is culturally unsuitable for a more Collec-
tivist society.
It is for good cultural reasons that various forms of state capitalism
or state socialism
are tried in Third World countries.
Most present-day management
theories
are "ethnocentric,"
that is, they take the
cultural environment
of the theorist
for granted. What we need is more cultural
sensitivity
in management
theories; we could call the result "organizational
an-
thropology" or "management
anthropology."
It is unlikely to be the product of one
single country's intellectual
effort; it needs by definition a synergy between
ideas
from different sources.
The fact that no single country now enjoys a degree of eco-
nomic dominance
as the U.S. once did will certainly help: economic
power is all
too often related to intellectual
influence.
In a world in which economic
power is
more widely spread, we can more easily hope to recognize truth coming from many
sources.
In this process,
the contribution of Japanese
and Chinese
scholars,
for
example,
will be vital, because
they represent
sources
of practical wisdom
and
ideas which complement
practices
and ideas born in Europe and the U.S.
The convergence
of management
will never come. What we can bring about is an
understanding
of how the culture in which we grew up and which is dear to us af-
fects
our thinking differently from other peoples'
thinking, and what this means
for the transfer of management
practices
and theories. What this can also lead to
is a better ability to manage intercultural negotiations
and multicultural organiza-
tions like the United Nations, which are essential
for the common survival of us all.
