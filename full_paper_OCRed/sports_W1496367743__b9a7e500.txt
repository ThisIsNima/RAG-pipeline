Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs of 18–25 nt in
length that negatively regulate their complementary mRNAs at the
posttranscriptional level. Previous work has shown that some
RNase III-like enzymes such as Drosha and Dicer are known to be
involved in miRNA biogenesis in animals. However, the mechanism
of plant miRNA biogenesis still remains poorly understood. In this
article, the process of Arabidopsis miR163 biogenesis was exam-
ined. The results revealed that two types of miR163 primary
transcripts (pri-miR163s) are transcribed from a single gene by RNA
polymerase II and that miR163 biogenesis requires at least three
cleavage steps by RNase III-like enzymes at 21-nt-long intervals.
The ﬁrst step is from pri-miR163 to long miR163 precursor (pre-
miR163), the second step is from long pre-miR163 to short pre-
miR163, and the last step is from short pre-miR163 to mature
miR163 and the remnant. It is interesting that, during the process,
four small RNAs including miR163 are released. By using dcl1
mutants, it was demonstrated that Arabidopsis Dicer homologue
Dicer-like 1 (DCL1) catalyzes at least the ﬁrst and second cleavage
steps and that double-stranded RNA-binding domains of DCL1 are
involved in positioning of the cleavage sites. Our result is direct
evidence that DCL1 is involved in processing of pri- and pre-miRNA.
M
icro-RNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous, small, noncoding
RNAs of 18–25 nt in length that negatively regulate their
complementary mRNAs at the posttranscriptional level in many
eukaryotic organisms (1). A large number of miRNAs have been
discovered in both plants and animals (2–4).
In animals, especially in the human, miRNA biogenesis and
functional pathways have been examined and partly described.
First, miRNA primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) are trimmed in
the nucleus into miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs) by an RNase
III-like enzyme called Drosha (5). After this initial processing,
the pre-miRNAs are exported to the cytoplasm by the function
of exportin-5 (6, 7) and are cleaved there to generate mature
miRNAs by another RNase III-like enzyme called Dicer (8).
These miRNAs are then incorporated into the RNA-induced
silencing complex (RISC) endonuclease, which seems to nega-
tively regulate the genes required for several developmental
processes by promoting RISC-mediated degradation of target
mRNAs, or the inhibition of target mRNA translation (9).
In the genome of Arabidopsis thaliana, four Dicer-like (DCL)
enzymes (DCL1–DCL4) are encoded (10). It has been shown
that one of the enzymes, DCL1, is involved in miRNA accumu-
lation (11). It is also known that DCL1 mRNA is subject to
negative feedback regulation by miR162-guided mRNA degra-
dation (12). On the other hand, DCL2 and DCL3 proteins are
partly involved in viral short interfering RNA (siRNA) biogen-
esis and endogenous siRNA biogenesis such as retrotransposon
siRNA, respectively (13).
However, the mechanism of plant miRNA biogenesis, in-
cluding the step where DCL1 acts, remains poorly understood,
because it has been difficult to detect pri- and pre-miRNAs by
Northern blot analysis. Here we report that miR163 biogenesis
requires at least three cleavage steps by RNase III-like en-
zymes and that DCL1 catalyzes at least the first and second
cleavage step. We also show that double-stranded RNA
(dsRNA)-binding domains of DCL1 are involved in position-
ing of the cleavage sites.
Materials and Methods
Plant Materials. Plant growth conditions were as described (14)
and differed only in photoperiod length, which was 16 h8 h in
this study. DCL1-9DCL1-9 homozygous plants were distin-
guished from DCL1-9dcl1-9 heterozygous plants by PCR am-
plification of the octopine synthase terminator sequence of the
T-DNA (portion of the tumor-inducing plasmid that is trans-
ferred to plant cells) by using genomic DNA as a template and
the primers 5-CTCCGTTCAATTTACTGATTGTAC-3 and
5-TTGAATGGTGCCCGTAACTTTCG-3.
Northern Blot Analysis. Total RNA was extracted from the entire
aerial portions of plants inoculated with mock or crucifer
tobamovirus Cg (TMV-Cg) (14) by using TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen). Low molecular weight RNA plus (LMW RNA)
was isolated by anion-exchange chromatography (RNADNA
Midi kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufac-
turer’s instructions with a minor exception: a specific elution
buffer [50 mM Mops1.0 M NaCl, pH 7.015% (vol/vol)
ethanol] was used in the elution step. For detection of pri-
miR163, pre-miR163, and miR163, LMW RNA was resolved
with electrophoresis on a denaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel (8
M urea) and 15% polyacrylamide gel (7 M urea), respectively,
in 0.5 TBE buffer (89 mM Tris89 mM boric acid2 mM
EDTA, pH 8.3) and electroblotted onto Hybond-N mem-
branes (Amersham Pharmacia). Radiolabeled DNA probes
(probes 1 and 2) were constructed by random priming reac-
tions in the presence of [-32P]dCTP by using the Megaprime
DNA-labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia). Radiolabeled
DNA oligonucleotide probes were constructed by end-labeling
with [-32P]ATP by using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Two
probes, 1 and 2, contained the following sequences, with
nucleotide numbers starting at the beginning of the pri-
miR163: nucleotides 149–479 (probe 1) and nucleotides 1–146
(probe 2). Probes 3 and 4 were end-labeled DNA oligonucle-
otides: 5-ATCGAAGTTCCAAGTCCTCTTCAA-3 (probe
3) and 5-CGATTTTATCCAAAGGGTTTTGGT-3 (probe
4). Probe 1 contained the region of DCL1-9 pre-miR163
corresponding to probe 1. The probes for detection of upper-
left (UL), miR163*, and lower-left (LL) small RNAs were also
end-labeled DNA oligonucleotides that were complementary
to their respective sequences.

Mapping of pri-miR163 Sequence. For mapping of the pri-miR163
sequence, RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA
ends was performed by using the GeneRacer kit (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA was
extracted from whole Arabidopsis plants. Poly(A) RNA was
purified by using the Oligotex-dT30 Super mRNA-purification
kit (Takara) and ligated to the GeneRacer RNA oligo adapter
(5-CGACUGGAGCACGAGGACACUGACAUGGACU-
GAAGGAGUAGAAA-3). The GeneRacer Oligo(dT) primer
[5-GCTGTCAACGATACGCTACGTAACGGCATGAC-
AGTG(T)18-3] was then used to prime first-strand cDNA
synthesis in the reverse-transcription reaction. The 5 ends of
pri-miR163 cDNA were amplified with the GeneRacer 5 primer
(5-CGACTGGAGCACGAGGACACTGA-3) and gene-
specific primer (5-ACACGGGGGATAATATCGAA-3). The
3 ends were amplified with the GeneRacer 3 primer (5-
GCTGTCAACGATACGCTACGTAACG-3), GeneRacer 3
nested primer (5-CGCTACGTAACGGCATGACAGTG-3),
and gene-specific primer (5-ACCCGGTGGATAAAATC-
GAG-3). PCR products were gel-purified and cloned into
pCR2.1 TOPO vector (Invitrogen) for sequencing.
Determination of Cleavage-Site Sequence. Aliquots of 5 g of low
molecular weight RNA plus were self-ligated with T4 RNA
ligase; the reaction volume was 100 l, and the reaction was
performed overnight at 14°C. After the ligation reaction,
RNAs were phenolchloroform-extracted and precipitated
with ethanol, and pre-miR163s or remnants were amplified by
RT-PCR with the gene-specific primers 5-GAAGTAACT-
GCGCAGTGCTTA-3 and 5-ACCGTGCTCTTCCTAA-
GAAG-3, which were used in both the reverse-transcription
reaction and PCR. These two primers have sequences corre-
sponding to nucleotides 375–394 (antisense) and 399–419
(sense) of pri-miR163, respectively. PCR products were gel-
purified and cloned into pCR2.1 TOPO vector for sequencing.
Prediction of RNA Secondary Structure. The potential secondary
structures of pre-miR163 were predicted by using MFOLD 3.1
(http:molbio.info.nih.govmolbio-nihmfold.html).
Results and Discussion
Characterization of pri-miR163. Most of the genes coding miRNA
sequences are located in intergenetic regions of the genome. In
the Arabidopsis genome, the miR163 gene is located on chro-
mosome 1 between the At1g66720 and At1g66730 genes (Fig.
1A). We discovered that both pri-miR163 and pre-miR163 could
be detected easily (unpublished data; Fig. 2). To examine the
detailed process of miRNA biogenesis, we first determined the
full sequence of pri-miR163 by 5 and 3 rapid amplification of
cDNA ends methods using oligo(dT) primers. Interestingly, we
obtained two types (types 1 and 2) of pri-miR163 sequences
[GenBank accession nos. AY615373 (type 1) and AY615374
(type 2)] (Fig. 1B). Both have a polyadenylation signal, but type
2 has an intron bearing exact splice sites. Because the polyade-
nylation signal of type 1 was located in the intron of type 2, it was
thought that type 2 pri-miR163 emerged by splicing through
exclusion of the polyadenylation signal for type 1 pri-miR163.
Another possible polyadenylation signal for type 2 pri-miR163
was found downstream from the intron. In addition, we could
find a TATA box-like sequence upstream from the transcribed
region. Taken together, it is obvious that pri-miR163 is tran-
scribed by RNA polymerase II.
miR163 Biogenesis Requires at Least Three Cleavage Steps. We
performed Northern blot analysis by using a probe comple-
mentary to the putative stem-loop region (Fig. 2A, probe 1)
and then detected some species of RNAs in uninfected (mock)
and TMV-Cg-infected plants. TMV-Cg infection could in-
crease accumulation of most miRNAs (unpublished data).
Previous work showed that expression of viral suppressors of
RNA silencing increased miRNA accumulation (15–17). We
preferentially used a TMV-Cg-infection condition for this
Northern blot analysis, because it dramatically increased the
accumulation of band d, described below, as well as miR163.
Judging from the molecular lengths, it was assumed that bands
a, c, and d correspond to pri-miR163, pre-miR163, and rem-
nant after release of mature miR163, respectively. Band b
probably corresponds to the precursor of pre-miR163. To
confirm our assignments, we used three other probes (probes
2–4) that are complementary to the 5 end sequence of
pri-miR163, the 24-nt miR163 sequence, and the stem root of
pri-miR163 (Fig. 2A). Probe 2 detected band a and new
reproducible band e, probe 3 detected bands a–c, and probe 4

polyadenylation signal for type 1 pri-miR163.

detected bands a and b (Fig. 2B, probes 2–4) as expected. Fig.
2C shows detection of mature miR163 using probe 3.
Based on the results shown in Fig. 2 B and C, we suggest a
model for miR163 biogenesis (Fig. 2D). The pri-miR163 (a) is
processed into long pre-miR163 (b) at the root of the stem-loop
structure, releasing 5 remnant (e), which corresponds to 5 end
of pri-miR163 (first step). At the next step, long pre-miR163 is
cleaved into short pre-miR163 (c) at the edge of the miR163
sequence (second step). Last, short pre-miR163 is cleaved at the
opposite edge of the miR163 sequence, producing mature
miR163 and remnant (d) (third step). Thus, miR163 biogenesis
requires at least three cleavage steps, probably by RNase III-like
enzymes.
Determination of Positions and Forms of RNase III-Cleavage Sites. To
determine the forms of three cleavage sites and confirm
whether they are catalyzed by RNase III proteins, we used a
method described previously (18). RNAs were self-ligated,
followed by RT-PCR using gene-specific primers (Fig. 3A).
Three bands detected between 200- and 400-nt molecular
markers were cloned and sequenced (Fig. 3B). The result is
shown in Fig. 3C. All three identified cleavage sites had a 3
overhang of 2 or 3 nt, which is a feature of RNase III cleavage
(Fig. 3C). It is notable that the length of two intervals between
separate cleavage sites was 21 nt long if a few bulges were not
counted. These intervals indicate that any DCL proteins that
are involved in miRNA biogenesis probably measure 21 nt in
length from one end to the next cleavage site, and then the site
was processed. This hypothesis is parallel with a previously
proposed cleavage model of animal Dicer (19). Our result
also suggested that the enzyme measures 21 nt on one strand
of the duplex RNA, because the miR163 strand is actually
24 nt in length, whereas the other strand is 21 nt (Fig. 3C,
gray box).
From this result, it was suspected that the other three cleavage
products [which we named upper left (UL), lower left (LL), and
miR163*, respectively; Fig. 3C] might be miRNAs. Therefore,
we performed Northern blot analysis for detection of these
products and miR163 by using probes complementary to them.
Small RNA UL and miR163 were detected easily, but small RNA
LL and miR163* were not detected easily (Fig. 3D). We noticed
that small RNA UL was identical to small RNA 91, which has
been designated already (3). Thus, the small RNA UL (or 91)
could be a candidate for miRNA. However, we could not
discover complementary target mRNAs to small RNA UL by
using the conventional BLAST method, probably because of lower
complementarity.
Disruption of miR163 Biogenesis in dcl1 Mutants. miR163 biogenesis
in dcl1-7 [sin1-1; Landsberg erecta (Ler) background] and dcl1-9
(carpel factory) mutants were examined by Northern blot anal-
ysis. The dcl1-7 mutant carries an amino acid substitution

is cleaved at the opposite edge of the miR163 sequence, producing mature miR163 and remnant (d). The predicted molecular length of each RNA from the result
of Fig. 3C is shown in this model.

(P415S) in the RNA helicase domain of the DCL1 protein (10,
20), whereas the dcl1-9 mutant has a T-DNA insertion in the
coding region for a second dsRNA-binding domain of DCL1
protein (10, 21). Both mutants fail to accumulate miRNAs (11,
16, 22). First, we performed Northern blot analysis by using
probe 1 (shown in Fig. 2A). In dcl1-7 mutants, the accumulation
of long pre-miR163 was at a similar level to that seen in wild-type
Ler plants (Fig. 4A, band b), whereas the accumulation of short
pre-miR163 and miR163 were at lower levels than those seen in
wild-type plants (Fig. 4A, band c). When the accumulation levels
of band b were normalized to 1.0 and the relative digital density
of band c was evaluated, the cb ratio in the case of dcl1-7 was
lower than that seen in the case of wild-type Ler (Fig. 4A, under
the panels).
The background in DCL1-9 plants was not wild-type Ler (at
least with respect to the miR163 gene). The pri-miR163 gene in
the DCL1-9 plants had an unexpected 12-nt deletion and 60-nt
insertion in the loop-forming region of its transcript (Fig. 6,
which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web
site), although the structure of the stem-forming region of
pre-miR163s was completely the same. Therefore, the molecular
length of long pre-miR163, short pre-miR163, and the remnant
should be 48 nt longer than those of Col-0 or Ler plants. In
dcl1-9dcl1-9 homozygous mutants, the accumulation of short
pre-miR163 was at a lower level than that seen in DCL1-9
DCL1-9 homozygous or DCL1-9dcl1-9 heterozygous plants
(Fig. 4B, band g), whereas the accumulation of long pre-miR163
was at a similar level to that seen in DCL1-9DCL1-9 or
DCL1-9dcl1-9 plants (Fig. 4B, band f). The gf ratio was also
lower than that of DCL1-9DCL1-9 and DCL1-9dcl1-9 plants
(Fig. 4B, under the panels). These results indicate that DCL1
catalyzes at least the second cleavage step from long pre-miR163
to short pre-miR163.
Next, we performed Northern blot analysis by using probe 2
(shown in Fig. 2A). In dcl1-7 mutants, the 5 remnant released
after the first cleavage step was not detected (Fig. 4C, band e),
and the accumulation of pri-miR163 increased (Fig. 4C, band a).
This result indicates that DCL1 also catalyzes the first cleavage
step from pri-miR163 to long pre-miR163. In all DCL1-9
DCL1-9, DCL1-9dcl1-9, and dcl1-9dcl1-9 backgrounds, the
bands corresponding to the 5 remnant were not detected (data
not shown).
Previous work showed that in both dcl2 and dcl3 mutant
plants, the accumulation of miRNAs was not affected compared
with wild-type plants (13). We examined whether the defects in
dcl2 and dcl3 mutants could affect miR163 biogenesis. The
dcl2-2 (SALK123586) and dcl3-1 (SALK005512) mutants con-
tain T-DNA insertions in the DCL2 (At3g03300) and DCL3
(At3g43920) genes, respectively. Accumulation of all miR163-
related RNAs, including miR163 itself, was not affected in dcl2-2
and dcl3-1 mutants (Fig. 4D).
Aberrant Positioning of Cleavage Sites in the dcl1-9 Mutant. We
examined the forms of three cleavage sites of miR163 and its
precursors in dcl mutant backgrounds in the same way as
described above. As shown in Fig. 5A, in dcl1-7 and dcl1-9dcl1-9
mutants, RT-PCR products had a relatively slow mobility com-
pared with that of the wild type (Ler or DCL1-9DCL1-9). This
result was consistent with the results shown in Fig. 4 A and B, in
which the accumulation of lower molecular RNA species (short
pre-miR163 and remnant) was lower than that of the wild type
(Fig. 4 A and B).
We performed cloning and sequencing of the RT-PCR prod-
ucts from dcl1-7, dcl1-9dcl1-9, DCL1-9DCL1-9, dcl2-2, and
dcl3-1 mutants. Three cleavage sites were consistent (as shown
in Fig. 3C) among dcl1-7, DCL1-9DCL1-9, dcl2-2, and dcl3-1
mutants (data not shown), whereas the cleavage sites were
different in dcl1-9dcl1-9 mutants. The result of the dcl1-9
dcl1-9 mutant is shown in Fig. 5B. Cleavage sites were not strictly
identical or mapped within 4–5 nt as depicted in Fig. 5B
(expressed in the gray zones). The first cleavage site was mapped
within zone f (Fig. 5B), and the second cleavage site was within
zone g. Both sites shifted to the loop side compared with those
of the DCL1-9DCL1-9 plant. It is interesting that the length of
the interval between these two cleavage sites is 21 nt long. It
was thought that dcl1-9 protein could not process the regular
cleavage position(s) because of its disrupted second dsRNA-
binding domain. Therefore, dsRNA-binding domains of DCL1
protein have an important role in determination of the cleavage
positions. We sequenced 30 clones, but the third cleavage site
was not identified, probably because the position of the 21-nt
sequence from the second cleavage site was not in the dsRNA-
forming region.
Taken together with the results shown in Fig. 4, this result in
dcl1-9 mutants suggests that DCL1 catalyzes at least the first and
second cleavage steps.
miRNA Biogenesis in Plants. In this article we investigated detailed
miR163 biogenesis, which is mediated through Dicer-like1 pro-
tein functions. Our data indicate that DCL1 not only catalyzes
at least the first cleavage step from pri-miR163 to long pre-
miR163 and the second cleavage step from long pre-miR163 to
short pre-miR163, releasing another miRNA candidate, small
RNA UL, but also is involved in positioning of the cleavage sites.
We also suspected that the third cleavage step might be catalyzed
by DCL1. Therefore, it is suggested that all cleavage steps are
probably catalyzed by the DCL1 protein. Thus, miR163 biogen-

esis is a powerful tool to investigate plant miRNA-maturation
processes.
miR163 biogenesis requires three cleavage steps by RNase
III-like enzymes. Because the dsRNA-forming stem regions of
most of the other predicted pre-miRNAs in Arabidopsis were
much shorter than that of pre-miR163, and they do not have the
two 21-nt-length sequences, it is supposed that most plant
miRNA biogenesis generally requires only two cleavage steps,
from pri-miRNA to pre-miRNA and from pre-miRNA to the
remnant and miRNA.
Previous work has shown that pre-miR167 is found in the
nucleus but not in the cytoplasm, whereas mature miR167 is
found in the cytoplasm but not in the nucleus in the tomatoes
(23). It has also been shown that Arabidopsis DCL1 protein
contains two putative nuclear localization signals (NLSs) (10)
and partial DCL1 (including NLSs); green fluorescent protein
fusion proteins localize to nuclei in the onion cells (24). Taken
together, our results suggest that all processes of plant miRNA
biogenesis occur in the nuclei.
In animal miRNA biogenesis, the first cleavage step from
pri-miRNA to pre-miRNA is catalyzed by an RNase III
enzyme, Drosha, but not Dicer (5). However, whole-genome
analysis suggested that the Arabidopsis genome does not
encode a Drosha homologue. In Arabidopsis, our data suggest
that the Dicer homologue DCL1 has a Drosha function to
catalyze the first cleavage step as well as a Dicer function. In
addition, plant pre-miRNAs are usually much longer than
those of animals. These differences between plant and animal
miRNA biogenesis are very interesting, although it is unknown
why they occur.
It was shown that dsRNA-binding domains of DCL1 protein
have an important role in determination of the first and second
cleavage positions (Fig. 5B). However, it was observed that the
21-nt interval between the first and second cleavage positions
was maintained in dcl1-9dcl1-9 mutants (Fig. 5B). Therefore,
we supposed that dcl1-9 proteins processed pri-miR163 at an
irregular position but could exactly measure 21 nt from the first
cleavage position to the next position.

2A). (B) Northern blot analysis for detection of pri-miR163 and pre-miR163 in dcl1-9 mutants using probe 1, which covers the stem-loop-forming region of DCL1-9
pri-miR163. (C) Northern blot analysis for detection of pri-miR163 and 5 remnant in dcl1-7 mutants using probe 2 (shown in Fig. 2A). (D) Northern blot analysis
for detection of pri-miR163 and pre-miR163 in dcl2-2 and dcl3-1 plants. miR163 was detected by using probe 3 (shown in Fig. 2A). The image of 5S rRNA and tRNA
was used as a loading control.
Fig. 5.
Aberrant positioning of cleavage sites in the dcl1-9 mutant. (A) Image
of agarose gel electrophoresis of RT-PCR products. (B) The two cleavage sites
in the dcl1-9dcl1-9 mutant. The gray boxes indicate the regions in which two
cleavage sites extend. Zones f and g correspond to the roots of bands f and g
of dcl1-9dcl1-9 mutants, respectively, shown in Fig. 4B. The number of
sequenced clones corresponding to each site is indicated above each gray box.
The gray arrows indicate the three cleavage sites in the wild type.
