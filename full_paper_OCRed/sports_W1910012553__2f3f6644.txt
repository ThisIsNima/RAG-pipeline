Abstract
In chronic infections and cancer, T cells are exposed to persistent antigen and/or inflammatory 
signals. This scenario is often associated with the deterioration of T cell function: a state called 
‘exhaustion’. Exhausted T cells lose robust effector functions, express multiple inhibitory 
receptors and are defined by an altered transcriptional programme. T cell exhaustion is often 
associated with inefficient control of persisting infections and tumours, but revitalization of 
exhausted T cells can reinvigorate immunity. Here, we review recent advances that provide a 
clearer molecular understanding of T cell exhaustion and reveal new therapeutic targets for 
persisting infections and cancer.
During acute infections or vaccinations, naive T cells are activated and differentiate into 
effector T cells over the course of 1–2 weeks1,2. This differentiation is accompanied by 
robust proliferation, transcriptional, epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming, and the 
acquisition of cardinal features of effector T cells such as effector function, altered tissue 
homing and dramatic numerical expansion1,2. Following the peak of effector expansion, the 
resolution of inflammation and the clearance of antigen, most activated T cells die, but a 
subset persists and transitions into the memory T cell pool. These memory T cells 
downregulate much of the activation programme of effector T cells, yet they maintain the 
ability to rapidly reactivate effector functions upon restimulation2. In addition, memory T 
cells develop a key memory property of antigen-independent self-renewal, which is a type of 
stem cell-like, slow division that is driven by interleukin-7 (IL-7) and IL-15. There is 
considerable diversity and complexity of memory T cell subsets and differentiation 
following acute infections or vaccinations (for example, effector memory T cells versus 
central memory T cells)2. However, a key aspect of the development of functional, persisting 
memory T cells is that after the effector phase, memory development occurs in the absence 
of ongoing antigen stimulation and high levels of persisting inflammation.
By contrast, during chronic infections and cancer — which involve persistent antigen 
exposure and/or inflammation — this programme of memory T cell differentiation is 
markedly altered3. An altered differentiation state, termed T cell exhaustion, usually 
manifests with several characteristic features, such as progressive and hierarchical loss of

effector functions, sustained upregulation and co-expression of multiple inhibitory receptors, 
altered expression and use of key transcription factors, metabolic derangements, and a 
failure to transition to quiescence and acquire antigen-independent memory T cell 
homeostatic responsiveness3–5 (FIG. 1). Although T cell exhaustion was first described in 
chronic viral infection in mice6,7, it has also been observed in humans during infections such 
as HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV), as well as in cancer3,5. Importantly, while T cell 
exhaustion prevents optimal control of infections and tumours, modulating pathways 
overexpressed in exhaustion — for example, by targeting programmed cell death protein 1 
(PD1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) — can reverse this dysfunctional 
state and reinvigorate immune responses3,5,8,9. Whereas T cell exhaustion and the reversal of 
this state of dysfunction have considerable relevance for tumours, an in-depth discussion of 
T cell exhaustion in cancer is beyond the scope of this Review and has been covered 
elsewhere recently10,11.
Of note, exhausted T cells are not inert (BOX 1). These cells retain suboptimal but crucial 
functions that limit ongoing pathogen replication or tumour progression. Despite this host–
pathogen ‘stalemate’ mediated by exhausted T cells, these cells are not effective in 
eradicating pathogens or tumours, and there has been considerable interest in avoiding or 
reversing exhaustion. The demonstration that T cell exhaustion is reversible (at least at the 
population level) rather than a terminal or irreversible fate provides a substantial clinical 
opportunity to use immunotherapy to improve immunity9. Although the immunological 
effects of these human treatments remain to be fully defined, emerging results support the 
notion that reversal of T cell exhaustion in humans is a causative mechanism for the marked 
antitumour effect that is seen in many patients receiving agents that block the PD1 pathway.
In this Review, we outline the characteristic features of altered functionality that are 
hallmarks of T cell exhaustion and focus on major advances in three key areas: first, 
inhibitory receptors and negative regulatory pathways; second, lack of canonical memory T 
cell properties and maintenance; and third, altered transcriptional control including recently 
defined progenitor and terminal progeny subsets of exhausted T cells controlled by T-bet and 
eomesodermin (EOMES)12. Where relevant, we also discuss similarities and differences 
between CD4+ and CD8+ exhausted T cells.
Developmental pathways of exhaustion
Persistent antigen exposure
A central question in this field has been: what causes T cell exhaustion? The development of 
CD8+ T cell exhaustion probably integrates information from altered inflammatory and 
tissue microenvironments, other lymphocyte populations such as CD4+ T cells, B cells and 
regulatory T (TReg) cells, and also inhibitory signals from cytokines and cell surface 
inhibitory and co-stimulatory receptors (FIG. 2). However, one key feature seems to be the 
chronic and probably continuous exposure to antigen rather than acutely terminated or 
intermittent exposure. Additional factors, including lack of CD4+ T cell help13 and perhaps 
instructive signals directly from inhibitory receptors14, probably also contribute to T cell 
exhaustion. Early studies in the chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) model 
demonstrated that the severity of exhaustion (and ultimately the deletion of antigen-specific

T cells) correlated with the level of antigen stimulation15. The importance of the level of 
antigen persistence in exhaustion was also confirmed in other mouse models and in human 
HIV-1 infection16–18. Indeed, if CD8+ T cells are primed during infection with a chronic 
strain of LCMV but removed from persisting antigen stimulation early (approximately 1 
week after infection), these cells can differentiate into fully functional CD8+ memory T 
cells19,20. However, if these T cells are instead exposed to a persisting antigen for 2–4 
weeks, T cell exhaustion becomes established, and these cells do not recover normal 
memory differentiation simply by removal from antigen exposure19,20. These observations 
are consistent with the notion that early antiviral treatment of HIV infection, and possibly 
HCV infection, in humans can preserve functional T cell responses17,21. In addition, specific 
T cell receptor (TCR)-dependent pathways, including those mediated by nuclear factor of 
activated T cells (NFAT) and sprouty homologue 2 (SPRY2), have been implicated in T cell 
exhaustion, consistent with a role for ongoing TCR stimulation22–24. Furthermore, chronic 
antigen stimulation also leads to sustained expression of PD1 through NFAT cytoplasmic 1 
(NFATc1)25. It is likely that PD1 further modulates the level of TCR signalling and provides 
an important feedback loop or rheostat to temper chronic antigen stimulation26,27 (FIG. 3). 
Thus, the level and duration of chronic antigen stimulation and infection seem to be key 
factors that lead to T cell exhaustion and correlate with the severity of dysfunction during 
chronic infection.
Inhibitory receptors
Inhibitory receptors are crucial negative regulatory pathways that control autoreactivity and 
immunopathology28. Although inhibitory receptors are transiently expressed in functional 
effector T cells during activation, higher and sustained expression of inhibitory receptors is a 
hallmark of exhausted T cells. The inhibitory signalling pathway mediated by PD1 in 
response to binding of PD1 ligand 1 (PDL1) and/or PDL2 offers an illustrative 
example27,29,30. Whereas our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which the 
inhibitory receptor PD1 controls T cell exhaustion remains incomplete, there are several 
mechanisms by which inhibitory receptors such as PD1 might regulate T cell function5,29 
(FIG. 3): first, by ectodomain competition, which refers to inhibitory receptors sequestering 
target receptors or ligands and/or preventing the optimal formation of microclusters and lipid 
rafts (for example, CTLA4 (REF. 31)); second, through modulation of intracellular 
mediators, which can cause local and transient intracellular attenuation of positive signals 
from activating receptors such as the TCR and co-stimulatory receptors32–34; and third, 
through the induction of inhibitory genes14.
Whereas there is some knowledge about PD1, our understanding of the intracellular 
mechanisms of action of inhibitory receptors — including those of PD1 — is incomplete. 
The intracellular domain of PD1 contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory 
motif (ITIM) and an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif (ITSM)35. In vitro studies 
suggest a role for the ITSM in recruiting the tyrosine-protein phosphatase SHP1 (also known 
as PTPN6) and/or SHP2 (also known as PTPN11)33,36. The role of the ITIM in PD1 
function remains poorly understood. Other evidence implicates a role for PD1 signalling in 
modulating the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), AKT and RAS pathways32,37, and also 
links PD1 to cell cycle control38. Notably, much of our information about how PD1 controls

T cell signalling is derived from in vitro studies of acutely activated T cells. In vivo studies 
of the role of PD1 during acute T cell activation and expansion suggest a possible role for 
PD1 signalling in either increasing mobility paralysis39 or decreasing migratory arrest26, 
depending on the context. Finally, signalling downstream of PD1 may in fact induce the 
expression of genes that could negatively regulate the expression of effector genes, such as 
BATF, which encodes the activator protein 1 (AP-1) family member basic leucine zipper 
transcription factor ATF-like14. Despite this elegant work, it is unclear how these 
observations relate to exhausted T cells exposed to chronic infection in vivo.
PD1 expression is rapidly upregulated upon T cell activation30, and it may persist at 
moderate levels in healthy humans40,41, indicating that PD1 expression alone is not a unique 
feature of exhausted T cells. However, during chronic infections PD1 expression can be 
substantially higher than observed on functional effector or memory CD8+ T cells42,43. 
During chronic infection, sustained upregulation of PD1 is usually dependent on continued 
epitope recognition44, although examples exist of residual PD1 expression even after 
removal of persisting antigen signalling20,45.
In addition to PD1, exhausted T cells express a range of other cell surface inhibitory 
molecules (FIG. 3). Exhausted T cells can co-express PD1 together with lymphocyte 
activation gene 3 protein (LAG3), 2B4 (also known as CD244), CD160, T cell 
immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain-containing protein 3 (TIM3; also known as 
HAVCR2), CTLA4 and many other inhibitory receptors18. Typically, the higher the number 
of inhibitory receptors co-expressed by exhausted T cells, the more severe the exhaustion. 
Indeed, although individual expression of PD1 or other inhibitory receptors is not indicative 
of exhaustion, co-expression of multiple inhibitory receptors is a cardinal feature. These co-
expression patterns are mechanistically relevant, as simultaneous blockade of multiple 
inhibitory receptors results in synergistic reversal of T cell exhaustion. This concept was 
demonstrated for PD1 and LAG3 (REF. 18) in chronic LCMV infection, and for PD1 and 
CTLA4 in HIV infection46, other infections47 and cancer48,49. Many other combinations of 
inhibitory receptors such as PD1 and TIM3 (REFS 50–53) can also co-regulate exhausted T 
cells. PD1 and CTLA4 blockade in patients with melanoma demonstrated impressive tumour 
control54, and clinical trials of other combinations of agents blocking inhibitory receptors 
are underway (for example, ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers NCT01968109, NCT02210117 
and NCT02408861, which are among >120 other trials involving the PD1 pathway). Overall, 
these data on the role of inhibitory receptors in co-regulation of T cell exhaustion suggest 
that these pathways are non-redundant. These molecules come from diverse structural 
families, bind ligands with distinct expression patterns and have distinct intracellular 
signalling domains (FIG. 3). Thus, there is the potential to tailor or tune the type and 
magnitude of exhausted T cell reinvigoration.
In addition to inhibitory receptors, it has become clear that co-stimulatory receptors are 
involved in T cell exhaustion29. For example, desensitization of co-stimulatory pathway 
signalling through the loss of adaptor molecules can serve as a mechanism of T cell 
dysfunction during chronic infection. The signalling adaptor tumour necrosis factor receptor 
(TNFR)-associated factor 1 (TRAF1) is downregulated in dysfunctional T cells in HIV 
progressors, as well as in chronic LCMV infection55. Adoptive transfer of CD8+ T cells

expressing TRAF1 enhanced control of chronic LCMV infection compared with transfer of 
TRAF1-deficient CD8+ T cells, which indicates a crucial role for TRAF1-dependent co-
stimulatory pathways in this setting55. It has also been possible to exploit the potential 
beneficial role of co-stimulation to reverse exhaustion by combining agonistic antibodies to 
positive co-stimulatory pathways with blockade of inhibitory pathways. 4-1BB (also known 
as CD137 and TNFRSF9) is a TNFR family member and positive co-stimulatory molecule 
that is expressed on activated T cells. Combining PD1 blockade and treatment with an 
agonistic antibody to 4-1BB dramatically improved exhausted T cell function and viral 
control56. Although a simple model of positive versus negative co-stimulation during T cell 
exhaustion probably has mechanistic validity, the diversity of pathways and much of the 
experimental data suggest that specific qualitative signals may be imparted by distinct co-
stimulatory and co-inhibitory pathways.
Soluble mediators
Soluble molecules are a second class of signals that regulate T cell exhaustion (FIGS 2,3); 
these include immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-10 and transforming growth factor-β 
(TGFβ) and inflammatory cytokines such as type I interferons (IFNs) and IL-6. For example, 
the IL-10–IL-10 receptor (IL-10R) pathway has received considerable attention for its role 
in T cell exhaustion. Blockade of IL-10 restores T cell function and improves viral control 
during chronic viral infections, demonstrating that IL-10 promotes or fosters T cell 
exhaustion57,58. Studies of LCMV infection in mice and HIV in humans demonstrated that 
many cell types can be the source of IL-10 during chronic infection including dendritic cells 
(DCs), monocytes and/or CD4+ T cells59–61. The most relevant source of this cytokine 
remains a matter of debate, although recent studies suggest that TH1 cells expressing B 
lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (BLIMP1; also known as PRDM1) are important 
IL-10 producers in chronic LCMV infection62. Simultaneous blockade of IL-10 and the PD1 
pathway in mice synergistically reverses CD8+ T cell exhaustion and enhances viral control, 
which indicates a role for IL-10 in controlling CD8+ T cell exhaustion63. Some evidence 
suggests a potential connection between the PD1 pathway and IL-10 production through 
induction of IL-10 by monocytes following ligation of PD1 by PDL1 (REF. 60). Despite the 
clear evidence that blocking IL-10 reverses exhaustion, the molecular events downstream of 
IL-10 signalling (presumably via signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)), 
which shape T cell exhaustion, remain to be more precisely defined.
TGFβ has also been implicated in T cell exhaustion. Phosphorylation of SMAD2 in CD8+ T 
cells was increased during chronic LCMV infection compared with acute infection, which 
suggests a role for TGFβ signalling. In vivo inhibition of TGFβ signalling in CD8+ T cells 
through expression of a dominant-negative receptor improved the function of exhausted T 
cells64. However, recent studies in mice using systemic administration of a TGFβ inhibitor 
or a blocking antibody found little benefit of these treatments65,66. Although it is difficult to 
directly compare the genetic approach to antibody- and inhibitor-based strategies, these 
observations may warrant further evaluation of the role of this immunoregulatory pathway in 
driving CD8+ T cell exhaustion.

The type I IFNs IFNα and IFNβ (hereafter referred to as IFNα/β) are crucial inflammatory 
cytokines that have essential antiviral functions early during infection. In most cases, acute 
viral control is dramatically compromised in the absence of IFNα/β signalling; this was 
recently confirmed in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of macaques67. 
Moreover, IFNα/β signalling can provide a critical ‘signal 3’ for proper activation and 
differentiation of CD8+ T cells following priming68. In addition to these crucial innate 
antiviral effects, however, recent studies have demonstrated a surprising role for chronic type 
I IFN signalling in facilitating viral persistence by promoting immune suppression and 
lymphoid tissue destruction during chronic infection. Despite the direct antiviral activity of 
IFNα/β, blocking this pathway during LCMV clone 13 infection paradoxically enhanced 
control of chronic viral replication and reversed and/or prevented T cell exhaustion69,70. 
Interestingly, applying this IFNα/β blockade early (within the first 1–2 days after infection) 
prevented later development of T cell exhaustion, suggesting a possible early role for IFNα/β 
signalling in ‘programming’ exhaustion. The IFNα/β effect seemed to operate via CD4+ T 
cells, though the precise mechanism remains to be defined. For example, IFNα/β can induce 
several immunoregulatory molecules including IL-10, PDL1 and indoleamine 2,3-
dioxygenase (IDO) in antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and other cell types71. Thus, whereas 
IFNα/β signals enhance viral control early during infection directly and indirectly (that is, by 
promoting effector CD8+ T cell differentiation), chronic exposure to IFNα/β can be 
detrimental and/or enhance T cell dysfunction during chronic infections. Indeed, exposure to 
chronic inflammation alone (that is, in the absence of TCR signalling) can impair optimal 
CD8+ memory T cell differentiation72. By contrast, other inflammatory pathways — 
including those induced by IL-6 and IL-27 — may be required for controlling chronic viral 
infection and avoiding CD8+ T cell exhaustion73,74. Although there is no clear evidence that 
IL-6 and IL-27 have direct intrinsic effects on CD8+ T cell exhaustion, these cytokines 
regulate CD4+ T cell differentiation and/or exhaustion during chronic viral infection. Thus, 
among inflammatory cytokines, there are some such as IL-6 and IL-27 that may have 
positive effects and skew T cells away from exhaustion, whereas others such as IFNα/β have 
more complex roles including positive and negative effects depending on the context. Effects 
of these cytokines on CD4+ T cell responses, such as enhanced IL-21 production, may have 
down-stream effects on preventing CD8+ T cell exhaustion (see below).
Regulatory cells
It is well known that forkhead box P3-expressing (FOXP3+) CD4+ TReg cells influence 
immune responses during many infections75,76 (FIG. 2). TReg cells can suppress T cell 
responses in acute infection and in the acute phase of chronic infection. The frequency of 
TReg cells can be increased in human chronic HIV and HCV infections, in which TReg cells 
may limit the responses of antiviral effector T cells in vitro76. However, it is still unclear 
whether TReg cells can directly cause CD8+ T cell and FOXP3−CD4+ T cell exhaustion. As 
TReg cells are a source of IL-10, TGFβ and perhaps other suppressive cytokines (for 
example, IL-35)76, such a scenario might exist. However, precisely how TReg cells affect the 
development of T cell exhaustion remains incompletely defined. Recent work in the chronic 
LCMV model system demonstrated an interaction between TRegcells and the PD1 pathway 
in regulating exhausted CD8+ T cells because simultaneous depletion of TReg cells and 
blockade of PD1 signalling had a highly synergistic effect on viral control and reversal of

exhaustion77. These data suggest a role for TReg cells in CD8+ T cell exhaustion. In addition 
to FOXP3+CD4+ TReg cells, other regulatory cell types — such as immunoregulatory APCs, 
myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)78,79, natural killer (NK) cells and even CD8+ 
regulatory populations80–82 — may influence viral persistence during chronic infections and 
directly or indirectly promote T cell exhaustion. Professional APCs can be direct targets of 
viruses, particularly during persisting infections, and dysfunction of DC cytokine production 
and cross-presentation has been reported in some chronic infections78,83. Indeed, early 
dysfunction of DCs may have a major role in facilitating viral persistence in some 
contexts83. Furthermore, destruction of tissue architecture and fibrosis of secondary 
lymphoid organs have been reported in both mice and human chronic infection84–86. 
Changes in lymphoid tissue architecture may contribute to poor T cell responses, but 
precisely how these anatomical features influence T cell exhaustion remains to be fully 
defined.
In addition to a possible role for TReg cells and other regulatory populations, positive signals 
from other cells are crucial in avoiding T cell exhaustion. It has long been known that loss of 
CD4+ T cell help during pathogen persistence can underlie or contribute to defective CD8+ 
T cell responses. Depletion of CD4+ T cells in the chronic LCMV model results in failed 
containment of chronic infection and more severe CD8+ T cell exhaustion13. In HIV 
infection, loss of CD4+ T cells is associated with increased exhaustion of CD8+ T cells and 
with disease progression. Although CD4+ T cells can clearly become exhausted (BOX 2), 
the impact of changes in the CD4+ T cell response on CD8+ T cell exhaustion is highly 
relevant. One key factor produced by CD4+ T cells during chronic infections is IL-21. In the 
absence of IL-21 signalling, CD8+ T cell exhaustion is substantially worse during chronic 
LCMV infection87–89, with similar observations in HIV infection90,91. IL-21 and CD4+ T 
cell help are also essential for optimal antibody responses, and recent work highlights the 
importance of antibody, including non-neutralizing antibody, during ongoing chronic viral 
infections92–95. It is interesting in this respect that antiviral CD4+ T cells generated during 
chronic infection demonstrate a skewing towards the T follicular helper (TFH) cell 
phenotype95,96. Further investigation is required to determine whether the key role of IL-21 
in limiting CD8+ T cell exhaustion is only due to a direct effect on CD8+ T cells or whether 
it also includes a component of antibody-mediated reduction in antigen load.
Overall, although various negative and positive regulatory pathways have been implicated in 
exhaustion, the role of these pathways in actually causing CD8+ T cell exhaustion has been 
less clear, in part because we are only just beginning to understand the developmental origin 
of exhausted CD8+ T cells.
Origin, homeostasis and durability
Questions have arisen about the origin of exhausted CD8+ T cells. Are these cells simply 
persisting effector T cells? How are exhausted CD8+ T cells, different from other 
dysfunctional T cells, such as senescent T cells or anergic T cells (TABLE 1)? Whereas 
there are some similarities between exhausted and CD8+ T cells, the transcriptional profiles 
of these two subsets are distinct4,97. Phenotypic markers can be identified that distinguish 
effector T cells from exhausted T cells, including markers that are highly expressed on

effector CD8+ T cells — such as CD44, LY6C and killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily 
G member 1 (KLRG1) — but are expressed at low or intermediate levels on exhausted T 
cells, as well as markers such as inhibitory receptors that are expressed at substantially 
higher levels by exhausted CD8+ T cells (TABLE 1). In addition, whereas CD8+ effector T 
cells co-express the transcription factors T-bet and EOMES98, exhausted T cell subsets 
express either T-bet or EOMES in a somewhat mutually exclusive pattern12 (see below).
Recent studies have directly compared the transcription programmes of exhausted CD4+ and 
CD8+ T cells in the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) model system96. These 
studies confirmed a core transcriptional signature of T cell exhaustion common to both 
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that included some transcription factors, inhibitory receptors, IFNα/
β signature genes, and dysregulated pathways such as proliferation. However, despite this 
similar core programme, exhausted CD4+ T cells were distinct from exhausted CD8+ T 
cells. For example, whereas PD1 expression was common to both lineages, the expression 
pattern of other inhibitory receptors was distinct for each subset46,96. Of note, the expression 
pattern of transcription factors differed extensively; exhausted CD4+ T cells had altered 
expression of, for example, GATA-binding protein 3, B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL-6) and 
Helios, which was not observed for exhausted CD8+ T cells. Together with altered 
expression of IL-10 and IL-21 and the redirection of CD4+ T cell responses from T helper 1 
cells to TFH-like cells95,96,146, these data suggest an altered and perhaps more complex 
differentiation programme for exhausted CD4+ T cells than previously appreciated. Indeed, 
transcription factor co-expression patterns in exhausted CD4+ T cells reveal substantial 
heterogeneity in this population96. Thus, although our understanding of exhaustion in CD4+ 
T cells still lags behind that in CD8+ T cells, the existing data suggest a distinct pattern of 
differentiation that may include enhanced skewing towards TFH cell-like cells, altered 
immunoregulatory pathways and a lineage-specific network of transcription factor control96. 
Future studies are needed to explore this heterogeneity in differentiation in more detail and 
to define the pathways and mechanisms that might be used to reverse dysfunction and 
reinvigorate exhausted CD4+ T cells.
Some of these observations also suggest a distinction between phenotypically defined 
senescence and exhaustion (TABLE 1). Whereas senescent CD8+ T cells are often defined 
by high expression of markers such as KLRG1 and/or CD57 (REFS 41,99,100), exhausted 
CD8+ T cells tend to have low expression of these markers97. Furthermore, exhausted CD8+ 
T cells have high expression of PD1, whereas senescent cells do not101. Although both 
exhausted and senescent CD8+ T cells have low proliferative capacity, this difference in 
phenotype suggests a potential distinction between these two cell states100. Analysis of the 
lineage origin of exhausted CD8+ T cells in the chronic LCMV model has demonstrated that 
exhausted T cells do not derive from the ‘senescent’ KLRG1+ subset of effector CD8+ T 
cells but rather from the CD127+ subset of memory precursors that are present in the 
effector phase20 (FIG. 1). These studies reinforce the notion that exhaustion and senescence 
are distinct and that exhausted CD8+ T cells arise from a skewed pattern of memory T cell 
differentiation rather than from a residual population of effector CD8+ T cells.
Exhausted CD8+ T cells have maintenance characteristics that are distinct from memory T 
cells that are generated after acute infection. Following acute infection, CD8+ memory T

cells can persist long term in the absence of antigen via IL-7- and IL-15-driven slow, steady 
homeostatic turnover (see below). This self-renewal capacity develops after the effector 
phase as CD8+ memory T cells acquire high co-expression of both CD122 (also known as 
IL-2Rβ) and CD127, which are the key receptor subunits for responsiveness to IL-7 and 
IL-15 (REFS 1,3,102). By contrast, exhausted CD8+ T cells have lower expression of 
CD122 and CD127 during chronic infection and are unable to respond efficiently to IL-7 or 
IL-15. As a result, exhausted T cells are maintained poorly when adoptively transferred to 
infection (antigen)-free recipients, although in some settings small numbers of these cells 
may persist45,103–107 (TABLE 1). Virus-specific CD8+ T cells become ‘addicted’ to their 
cognate antigen, and continuous TCR stimulation is needed for the maintenance of 
exhausted T cells103,104. A similar scenario is also likely to occur in humans based on 
apparent loss of virus-specific CD8+ T cells after antiviral treatment or epitope 
escape21,108,109. This antigen-dependent maintenance is accompanied by extensive ongoing 
division of a subset of exhausted CD8+ T cells; for example, a subset of exhausted T cells 
gives rise to cells that divide at least 5–7 times per week for a prolonged period of time in 
chronic LCMV infection12,104. This maintenance pattern is in stark contrast to the slow 
homeostatic turnover of memory CD8+ T cells, for which there are only one or two divisions 
in a month. Similar maintenance phenotypes have also been reported for T cells responding 
to persisting herpesviruses110,111.
A key unanswered question, therefore, is: what happens to exhausted CD8+ T cells in 
clinical settings in which chronic infections are cured? Will these exhausted CD8+ T cells 
disappear? Will they differentiate into functional T cells? As we rapidly move towards a 
drug-mediated cure of HCV infection — a setting that often shows marked T cell exhaustion 
— understanding the fate of exhausted T cells after cure, and determining whether these 
cells can provide protection if re-exposed to HCV, will become critical. Similar scenarios 
may also exist in cancer immunotherapy. Better defined cellular and molecular mechanisms 
that underlie the persistence of exhausted CD8+ T cells will be important in answering these 
questions.
Homeostatic cytokines
In contrast to the immunosuppressive cytokines described above, common γ-chain cytokines 
can positively affect T cell responses during chronic viral infections. IL-2 treatment during 
chronic LCMV infection resulted in an increase in the number of antigen-specific CD8+ T 
cells and increased viral control, consistent with reversal of T cell exhaustion112. Combining 
IL-2 treatment with blockade of the PD1-mediated inhibitory pathway had striking 
synergistic effects for re-invigorating exhausted CD8+ T cells and decreasing viral load113. 
IL-7 treatment early during chronic LCMV infection augmented T cell responses and 
enhanced viral clearance, effects that were in part dependent on inhibition of suppressor of 
cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3) and on endogenous IL-6 (REFS 114,115). This early IL-7 
treatment probably occurred at time points before severe loss of IL-7 responsiveness during 
chronic LCMV infection. As discussed above, IL-21 also has an important role during 
chronic infection. IL-21, produced primarily by antigen-specific CD4+ T cells, is required to 
sustain antiviral CD8+ T cell responses and prevent exhaustion during chronic LCMV 
infection87–89,91. However, IL-21 may also restrict virus-driven TReg cell populations116.

Despite many important insights about the role of common γ-chain cytokines in chronic 
infection, it remains unclear where and when these signals are important in vivo during 
chronic infections, what regulates their availability and how signalling via IL-21R, for 
example, alters the cellular and molecular mechanisms that maintain exhausted CD8+ T 
cells.
Maintaining exhausted T cell populations
The identification of subsets of exhausted CD8+ T cells defined by expression of PD1, 
CD44, other phenotypic markers and the transcription factors T-bet and EOMES has enabled 
the lineage dynamics of these populations to be defined12,42 (FIG. 1). Specifically, T-bet and 
EOMES delineate key subsets of exhausted CD8+ T cells and a proliferative hierarchy that 
maintains exhausted T cell populations12. Exhausted CD8+ T cells are under considerable 
strain to maintain ongoing antigen-driven activation and proliferation without depleting the 
‘clone’ of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. T-bet and EOMES cooperate to sustain the overall 
exhausted CD8+ T cell pool. Specifically, two distinct subpopulations exist: a small T-
bethiPD1mid progenitor pool with residual proliferative potential and a numerically larger 
population of EOMEShiPD1hi terminal progeny with higher co-expression of other 
inhibitory receptors and limited proliferative capacity12 (FIG. 1). This role for T-bet is 
interesting because whereas high levels of T-bet expression are closely associated with 
terminal differentiation in acute infection, high T-bet expression in chronic infection 
partially represses the expression of PD1 and other inhibitory receptors and identifies a 
subset of exhausted CD8+ T cells that retains some (albeit weakened) proliferative capacity 
during chronic infection12,42,117. Persistent antigen causes T-bethiPD1mid to lose T-bet 
expression, undergo proliferation and convert to EOMEShiPD1hi cells12. The resulting 
terminal progeny have weaker cytokine production but enhanced killing ability. They also 
accumulate in peripheral tissues and have a total population size that is ~20-fold greater than 
the T-bethi progenitor pool. Importantly, PD1 pathway blockade seems to only reinvigorate 
the T-bethi subset, while having little to no impact on the EOMEShi cells42, indicating an 
important aspect of population dynamics in checkpoint blockade-mediated reversal of T cell 
exhaustion. Importantly, genetic deletion of either transcription factor leads to loss of the 
respective subset (that expresses high levels of the transcription factor), failed long-term 
maintenance of the exhausted CD8+ T cell pool and loss of the ability to establish a host–
pathogen stalemate, resulting in high viral loads. Although these lineage relationships were 
defined in the chronic LCMV model, central aspects of this model — including the 
existence of exhausted CD8+ T cells subsets defined by T-bet and EOMES, and a bias 
towards the EOMEShi terminally differentiated subset with more severe infection — have 
been confirmed in human HCV and HIV infection12,118. Persistently high levels of antigen 
might be anticipated to cause continuous proliferation and depletion of the progenitor pool. 
Although there is some evidence for erosion of the T-bethi progenitor pool in prolonged 
viraemia12, whether this population self-renews is unclear. It is also possible that 
replenishment could occur from new thymic emigrants primed on persisting antigen119,120. 
Although mice that have undergone thymectomy do not have major defects in maintaining 
antiviral CD8+ T cell responses during chronic infection121, and adoptively transferred TCR-
transgenic cells become exhausted and are maintained long-term without thymic

contribution117,122, new thymic emigrants could make quantitative or qualitative 
contributions to virus-specific CD8+ T cell responses in the long term. Thus, the existence of 
a proliferative hierarchy for the maintenance of exhausted CD8+ T cells provides a 
framework for understanding the durability of these cells over time, but many important 
questions remain about the signals involved and molecular mechanisms underlying this 
process. In addition, how these events change during infections with different levels and/or 
types of persistence remains to be explored.
Transcriptional control of exhaustion
Recent studies have applied genomic approaches to investigate the transcriptional circuitry 
underlying T cell exhaustion. Both CD4+ and CD8+ exhausted T cells have a transcriptional 
profile that is markedly different from effector and memory CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, 
including major changes in the expression of inhibitory and co-stimulatory receptors, 
transcription factors, signalling molecules, cytokine and chemokine receptors, and genes 
involved in metabolism4,96,97. Thus, in addition to phenotyping, fate-mapping and functional 
analysis, genomic studies also support the concept that exhausted T cells represent a unique 
state of T cell differentiation. These studies have also revealed key differences between the 
exhausted phenotypes of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (BOX 2).
Although considerable progress has been made in defining centrally important transcription 
factors, a lineage-specific transcription factor for exhausted T cells has not been identified. 
Nonetheless, in addition to T-bet and EOMES discussed above, the transcription factors 
BLIMP1, NFAT, BATF, von Hippel–Lindau disease tumour suppressor (VHL), FOXO1 and 
FOXP1 have been implicated in CD8+ T cell exhaustion12,14,22,24,117,123–126, and it is likely 
that other transcription factors involved in T cell exhaustion remain to be identified. A key 
concept that has emerged, however, is that although these transcription factors can have roles 
in other T cell populations, the expression pattern, the genes controlled and the manner in 
which key transcription factors operate can be distinct in exhausted T cells compared with in 
other T cell subsets (FIG. 4). In other words, there are exhaustion-specific functions for key 
transcription factors. For example, whereas T-bet is expressed by, and has a functional role 
in the formation of, terminally differentiated CD8+ T cells in acute infection1,127, during 
chronic infection T-bet controls the population of non-terminal progenitor cells within the 
exhausted T cell pool12 (see above and FIG. 1). Similarly, EOMES is involved in central 
memory T cells following acute infection, when it is involved in controlling quiescence and 
homeostatic turnover128–130. However, during chronic infection EOMES controls the 
formation of a terminally differentiated (non-quiescent) subset of exhausted T cells that is 
highly enriched in peripheral tissues12. This distinct context-specific reuse of transcription 
factors was further interrogated using transcriptional network analysis, which demonstrated 
that the same transcription factors can have markedly different functions in memory CD8+ T 
cells versus exhausted CD8+ T cells4. The concepts of context-specific transcription factor 
function and combinatorial transcription factor control of cellular differentiation and/or 
lineage development have also been observed in other settings131,132. These different 
functions could occur for various reasons including the availability of distinct cofactors, 
concentration-dependent binding to different genomic sites and altered genomic accessibility 
due to epigenetic changes (FIG. 4).

The epigenome provides the context in which transcription factors function. Although global 
epigenetic landscape information does not yet exist for exhausted T cells, studies of the 
Pdcd1 locus (which encodes PD1) have been informative (FIG. 4b). Analysis of the Pdcd1 
promoter region in acutely resolved LCMV infection demonstrated that these regions were 
largely demethylated in the effector phase and then became remethylated as infection 
resolved and CD8+ T cell memory formed122. By contrast, the Pdcd1 locus became 
completely demethylated in chronic LCMV infection and no remethylation was observed, 
even when viral titres and PD1 protein expression by exhausted CD8+ T cells decreased122. 
Similar data were obtained in studies examining well-controlled HIV infection133. These 
observations and other studies134 suggest not only an important layer of epigenetic 
regulation on gene expression in CD8+ T cell exhaustion but also provide evidence for a 
durable imprint of exhaustion in the epigenome. Future studies are clearly warranted to 
define global epigenetic changes in more detail, to determine how such an imprint will affect 
the success of immunotherapies and the development of memory following cure of chronic 
infections.
Open questions and future directions
Although advances over the past decade have shed considerable light on the mechanisms of 
T cell exhaustion and have revealed novel therapeutic opportunities, there are still many 
important unanswered questions. The recognition of potent and diverse negative regulatory 
pathways, such as the PD1 pathway, that can be targeted experimentally and clinically has 
been a major step forward with the potential to revolutionize immunotherapy of chronic 
infections and cancer. Despite this promise, we still understand surprisingly little about the 
molecular mechanisms by which these pathways operate, and where, when and how these 
negative pathways signal and initiate or execute a programme of exhaustion. Moreover, we 
still lack a true molecular understanding of the intriguing observations of synergy when 
targeting multiple pathways simultaneously for reversal of T cell exhaustion. In addition to 
inhibitory receptors, one of the emerging defining features of T cell exhaustion is the altered 
use of key transcription factors (FIG. 4). In general, we are only just beginning to understand 
the transcriptional coordination of T cell exhaustion, how these transcriptional networks 
change over time and what happens to these events upon reversal of exhaustion.
In addition to understanding the molecular mechanisms of inhibitory receptor and 
transcription factor function in T cell exhaustion, several other key areas are likely to reveal 
substantial new insights into fundamental aspects of T cell exhaustion. First, we lack an 
understanding of the epigenetic landscape of T cell exhaustion (FIG. 4). A second related 
issue is to define the nature of terminal differentiation in the exhausted T cell pool. Cellular 
reprogramming studies have demonstrated that, if taken back to an embryonic stem cell, 
exhausted CD8+ T cells can give rise to new naive T cells135. Although this is important in 
demonstrating the concept of reprogramming, such an approach may be challenging to 
implement clinically. Thus, it will be important to define the nature of terminal 
differentiation versus reprogramming that can occur for exhausted T cells at the epigenetic 
level. Given the clinical opportunities with PD1 blockade and also the ability to cure chronic 
infections such as HCV, it will be crucial to investigate these issues. Finally, numerous 
recent studies have addressed the critical importance of metabolism in regulating the T cell

differentiation136. Although emerging studies have begun to investigate these issues for 
chronic infections124,125, a more comprehensive understanding of metabolic alterations in 
exhausted T cells will probably be highly informative.
In summary, T cell exhaustion represents a distinct state of T cell differentiation with 
considerable clinical relevance. Recent work defining the mechanisms of T cell exhaustion 
has provided many insights as well as clinical opportunities. Despite this progress, our 
understanding of T cell exhaustion and how to most effectively reverse this state remains 
incomplete. Future mechanistic and clinical studies are needed to develop the next 
generation of immune-based interventions for chronic infections and cancer.

Glossary
Effector memory T cells
A subset of memory T cells that resides in peripheral 
tissues and retains high levels of effector function such 
as the production of interferon-γ and granzymes.
Central memory T cells
A subset of memory T cells that expresses CD62L and 
CC-chemokine receptor 7 and resides mainly in the 
lymph nodes and spleen. These cells have high 
proliferative potential upon antigen re-encounter.
Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)
A virus that induces a strong T cell response and 
therefore provides good mouse model of infection. 
Although they only differ by two nucleotides, the 
Armstrong strain of LCMV causes acute infection and 
the clone 13 strain causes chronic infection. As major 
antigenic epitopes are conserved between these two 
strains, the fate of antigen-specific T cells can be easily 
compared (that is, memory after infection with the 
Armstrong strain versus exhaustion after infection with 
the clone 13 strain).
Antigen-presenting cells (APCs)T cells can be activated when antigen is displayed by 
major histocompatibility complexes (MHC restriction). 
This antigen presentation is largely executed by 
professional APCs, particularly dendritic cells. APCs 
also influence T cell differentiation by producing 
cytokines such as type I interferons and interleukin-12.

Senescent T cells
Cells that enter a terminal differentiation state owing to 
excessive cell replication. This state is associated with 
irreversible cell cycle arrest and telomere shortening.
Anergic T cells
An unresponsive state that is induced by suboptimal 
stimulation (that is, signal 1 without signal 2) at the time 
of priming by antigen.
Epigenetic landscape
Historically, this is proposed to refer to embryonic 
development and how genes might interact with their 
surroundings to lead to the expression of a certain 
phenotype. The current view of the epigenetic landscape 
is that overall epigenetic changes such as (but not limited 
to) DNA methylation and histone modifications, are 
accumulated genome wide and have strong impact on 
cellular differentiation.

Evolutionary perspective on T cell exhaustion
What is the biological significance of exhausted T cells to the host? First, it is important 
to point out that exhausted T cells are not inert. In nearly all cases, exhausted T cells have 
some level of residual function, and this residual function (or other as yet unappreciated 
properties of exhausted T cells) may be important in vivo. For example, exhausted T cells 
can drive epitope mutation during chronic infections109, and depletion of CD8+ T cells 
during the chronic phase of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection results in 
rapid and marked exacerbation of viraemia and progression to AIDS137,138. This result 
indicates that although exhausted CD8+ T cells are poorly functional, they are not 
functionally inert and have a crucial role in maintaining a virus–host stalemate by 
restraining viral replication. Moreover, whereas epitope escape in SIV, HIV and hepatitis 
C virus (HCV) infection often occurs early, escape in the chronic phase of infection — 
and also probably in the setting of tumour immune editing — may be driven by 
exhausted T cells. Finally, when the ability to sustain exhausted CD8+ T cell populations 
is compromised, all containment of chronic infection can be lost12. In settings of chronic 
infection where immunopathology can occur, T cell exhaustion may serve as a 
mechanism to protect against tissue damage139. In this context, one might envision that 
for viruses that cannot be fully eradicated, at least containing these pathogens to low 
levels might be the evolutionary driver of T cell exhaustion. For herpesviruses, for 
example, continually driving a virus back into viral latency may require local effector 
function, but a robust proliferative burst such as might occur for central memory T cells 
(or even effector memory T cells) might prove pathogenic. Evidence for such a scenario 
may exist for herpes simplex virus (HSV)140,141, although whether this applies for other 
herpesviruses remains a subject of some debate. Many persisting pathogens have evolved 
strategies to establish a host–pathogen balance, and there are many examples of viruses 
that cause chronic infections by evading immunity through the expression of immune 
evasion genes and through other strategies. However, in many if not most cases, 
uncontrolled pathogen replication does not occur, and a balance between pathogen 
replication and immune control is usually achieved. Overall, despite decreased 
functionality, the raison d’être for exhausted T cells may be to establish a host–pathogen 
stalemate for some persisting infections. Other persisting pathogens seem to have 
exploited this immunological ‘niche’ to continue to replicate, spread and cause disease.

CD4+ T cell exhaustion
Virus-specific CD4+ T cells also lose effector function during chronic viral 
infections19,96,142,143. In fact, dysregulation of CD4+ T cell responses may be a crucial 
event in failed immune control in human chronic infections144,145. Exhausted CD4+ T 
cells, similar to exhausted CD8+ T cells, display reduced production of effector cytokines 
(such as tumour necrosis factor and interferon-γ (IFNγ)) and express high levels of 
programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1)96. In addition, exhausted CD4+ T cells have 
characteristics that are distinct from exhausted CD8+ T cells. For instance, poor effector 
function is often apparent earlier for virus-specific CD4+ T cells than for CD8+ T cells 
during chronic infection19,96,143, and exhausted CD4+ T cells often produce 
interleukin-10 (IL-10) and/or IL-21 (REFS 57,95,96). Moreover, there is evidence of a 
skewing towards T follicular helper (TFH) cells during chronic viral infections95,96 that 
may be dependent on chronic IFNα/β signalling146. These observations are intriguing and 
may provide insights that are relevant to cryoglobulinaemia and to altered antibody 
production during some human chronic infections147–149, as well as for the importance of 
IL-21 signalling in sustaining exhausted CD8+ T cells87–89. Thus, patterns of 
differentiation for exhausted CD4+ T cells suggest perhaps more complex regulation than 
is required for the differentiation of exhausted CD8+ T cells.

Figure 1. Progressive development of T cell exhaustion
Upon infection, naive T cells are activated by antigen, co-stimulation and inflammation, and 
they exponentially proliferate to form effector populations1,2. Whereas the majority of 
effector CD8+ T cells that express killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily G member 1 
(KLRG1) die during the contraction phase, a population of effector CD8+ T cells that retains 
CD127 expression can give rise to memory or exhausted CD8+ T cells. In the setting of 
acute infection, where antigen and/or inflammation is cleared, effector CD8+ T cells further 
differentiate into functional memory CD8+ T cells that can produce multiple cytokines (such 
as interferon-γ (IFNγ), tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-2 (IL-2)) and mount 
robust recall responses upon secondary infection1,2. These memory T cells are also 
maintained efficiently long term without antigen via IL-7- and IL-15-driven homeostatic 
self-renewal102. By contrast, during chronic infection, antigen and inflammation persist after 
the effector phase. As infection progresses and T cell stimulation continues, T cells lose 
effector functions in a hierarchical manner and become exhausted3. Typically, functions such 
as IL-2 production and cytokine polyfunctionality, as well as high proliferative capacity, are 
lost early; this is followed by defects in the production of IFNγ, TNF and chemokines, as 
well as in degranulation. T cell exhaustion is also accompanied by a progressive increase in 
the amount and diversity of inhibitory receptors that are expressed, including programmed 
cell death protein 1 (PD1), lymphocyte activation gene 3 protein (LAG3), 2B4, CD160 and 
T cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin and ITIM domains (TIGIT). Ultimately, if the 
severity or duration of the infection is high or prolonged, virus-specific T cells can be lost 
(‘deletion’). Variables — such as the level and number of inhibitory receptors expressed, 
strength of antigen stimulation, availability of CD4+ T cell help and the duration of infection 
— can all influence the severity of exhaustion. Exhausted T cell populations are 
heterogeneous, and subsets of T-bethi PD1mid and EOMEShi PD1hi CD8+ exhausted T cells

Figure 2. Overview of mechanisms of T cell exhaustion
Pathways implicated in regulating T cell exhaustion can be classified into three general 
categories (centre and inner circle): cell-to-cell signals including prolonged T cell receptor 
(TCR) engagement (signal 1) and co-stimulatory and/or co-inhibitory signals (signal 2); 
soluble factors such as excessive levels of inflammatory cytokines (for example, type I 
interferons (IFNs)) and suppressive cytokines including interleukin-10 (IL-10) and 
transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ); and tissue and microenvironmental influences driven 
by changes in the expression levels of chemokine receptors, adhesion molecules and nutrient 
receptors. This last class of influences may include altered tissue distribution and/or 
migratory patterns and lead to changes in pathways sensing oxygen tension (the von Hippel–
Lindau tumour suppressor (VHL) and/or hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathways), pH and 
nutrient levels. Tissue destruction and altered lymphoid organization may have a major role. 
Other immune cell types and stromal cells could be the source of many of these changes 
(outer circle). Cell types such as antigen-presenting cells (APCs), CD4+ T cells, natural 
killer (NK) cells, B cells and regulatory cells (for example, myeloid-derived suppressor cells 
(MDSCs) and regulatory T (TReg) cells) have been implicated in CD8+ T cell exhaustion. 
Overall, during chronic infections, cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic signals are probably 
integrated and thereby negatively influence T cell differentiation and promote exhaustion. 
The precise balance of these signals may determine the severity and/or qualitative aspects of 
T cell exhaustion in different disease settings. CTLA4, cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4; 
DC, dendritic cell; FOXP3, forkhead box P3; LAG3, lymphocyte activation gene 3 protein;

Figure 3. Molecular pathways of inhibitory receptors associated with T cell exhaustion
Ligand and receptor pairs for inhibitory pathways are depicted, showing the intracellular 
domains of receptors that contribute to T cell exhaustion. Many inhibitory receptors have 
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) and/or immunoreceptor tyrosine-
based switch motifs (ITSMs) in their intracellular domains; however, some receptors have 
specific motifs, such as YVKM for cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) and 
KIEELE for lymphocyte activation gene 3 protein (LAG3). The molecular mechanisms of 
inhibitory receptor signalling are also illustrated and can be classified as: ectodomain 
competition (inhibitory receptors sequester target receptors or ligands); modulation of 
intracellular mediators (local and transient intracellular attenuation of positive signals from 
activating receptors such as T cell receptors and co-stimulatory receptors); and induction of 
inhibitory genes. Multiple inhibitory receptors are responsible for these three mechanisms. 
AP-1, activator protein 1; BAT3, HLA-B-associated transcript 3 (also known as BAG6); 
BTLA, B and T lymphocyte attenuator; CEACAM1, carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell 
adhesion molecule 1; GRB2, growth factor receptor-bound protein 2; HVEM, herpes virus 
entry mediator (also known as TNFRSF14); NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T cells; NF-
κB, nuclear factor-κB; PD1, programmed cell death protein 1; PDL1, PD1 ligand 1; PI3K, 
phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PLCγ, phospholipase Cγ; TIGIT, T cell immunoreceptor with 
immunoglobulin and ITIM domains; TIM3, T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-

Figure 4. Transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms of T cell exhaustion
Altered usage of key transcription factors is associated with the altered transcriptional and 
developmental programme of T cell exhaustion. Several potential mechanisms exist. a | 
Different use of transcription factor binding partners is one potential mechanism for distinct 
context-dependent transcription factor activity. In the example shown, transcription factor B 
is closely associated with memory-related genes in the context of acute infection where 
transcription factor A is abundant (top panel). However, the same transcription factor B is 
linked with exhaustion-related genes in chronic infection (lower panel). Post-translational 
modifications of transcription factors and/or their subcellular localization may also be 
important in this setting. b | The dosage or concentration of a transcription factor could also 
provide a mechanism for context-dependent transcriptional function. Here, a transcription 
factor binds only at specific high-affinity binding sites if the amount of the factor is low (top 
panel). By contrast, at high transcription factor concentrations binding can occur more 
broadly (that is, occurring also at lower affinity sites), which leads to different 
transcriptional activity (lower panel). c | DNA methylation, histone modifications and the 
‘chromatin landscape’ resulting from overall epigenetic regulation could provide a 
mechanism for context-specific transcription factor function in exhausted T cells 
(transcription factor X in this example). The enhancer landscape of a cell may determine 
how different transcription factors function.
