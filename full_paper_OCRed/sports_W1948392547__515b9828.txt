This study examined the relative inﬂuence of adolescents’ supportive relationships with teachers, peers, and
parents on trajectories of different dimensions of school engagement from middle to high school and how these
associations differed by gender and race or ethnicity. The sample consisted of 1,479 students (52% females,
56% African American). The average growth trajectories of school compliance, participation in extracurricular
activities, school identiﬁcation, and subjective valuing of learning decreased from 7th to 11th grades (mean
ages = 12.9 years to 17.2 years). Different sources of social support were not equally important in their impact
on school engagement, and the effect of these sources differed by the aspect of engagement studied. For
instance, peer social support predicted adolescents’ school compliance more strongly and school identiﬁcation
less strongly than teacher social support.
Active school engagement is vital to a student’s
educational success and development as a compe-
tent member of society (Van Acker & Wheby,
2000). Although considerable research has focused
on
school
engagement
(Appleton,
Christenson,
Kim, & Reschly, 2006), few longitudinal studies
have investigated the inﬂuence of contextual factors
on school engagement developmental trajectories.
Research suggests that social support from teachers,
peers, and parents can promote positive academic
outcomes and prevent negative psychological out-
comes during adolescence (Garnefski & Diekstra,
1996; Malecki & Demaray, 2007; Wang, Selman,
Dishion,
&
Stormshak,
2010).
Can
these
three
sources of social support also facilitate school
engagement? In this study, we examine the trajecto-
ries of four indicators of school engagement (school
compliance, participation in extracurricular activi-
ties, school identiﬁcation, and subjective valuing of
learning at school) from 7th through 11th grades
and investigate whether social support from teach-
ers, peers, and parents contributes to changes in
school engagement over time.
Multidimensional Construct of School Engagement
School engagement is a multidimensional con-
struct that includes behavioral, emotional, and cog-
nitive components (Fredricks, Blumenfeld, & Paris,
2004). Behavioral engagement includes (a) positive
conduct, compliance with school rules, and absence
of disruptive behaviors (Connell, 1990) and (b) par-
ticipation in school-related activities (Finn, 1993).
Emotional engagement includes (a) positive affec-
tive reactions in the classroom such as enjoyment
and interest (Skinner & Belmont, 1993) and (b) per-
sonal identiﬁcation and belonging (Voelkl, 1997).
Cognitive engagement includes (a) motivation to
learn, intrinsic motivation, and task valuing in
school (Ames, 1992) and (b) self-regulated learning
strategies such as planning, monitoring, and evalu-
ating one’s own progress (Zimmerman, 1990). Until
quite recently, most empirical studies have mea-
sured school engagement as either a unidimen-
sional construct of these various indicators or at
most two of the three types of school engagement
(Perry, Liu, & Pabian, 2010). These practices pre-
clude investigation of the differences among the
various types of engagement and understanding
their possible antecedents and consequences. Thus,
we conceptualize school engagement as a multidi-
mensional construct reﬂecting each of the three
subtypes suggested by Fredricks et al. (2004): (a)
school compliance (behavioral engagement), (b)
participation in extracurricular activities (behav-
ioral engagement), (c) school identiﬁcation (emo-
tional engagement), and (d) subjective valuing of
learning (cognitive engagement).

Trajectories of School Engagement During Adolescence
In several studies, older adolescents report lower
levels of school engagement than younger adoles-
cents on various indicators of school engagement
(Johnson, Crosnoe, & Elder, 2001; Marks, 2000).
However, most existing studies of school engage-
ment have relied on cross-sectional or very short
term longitudinal studies—making it difﬁcult to
conﬁrm whether age-related differences indicate
true developmental trends rather than cohort effects
(Archambault, Janosz, Morizot, & Pagani, 2009;
Skinner, Kinderman, & Furrer, 2010; Wang & Eccles,
2011). Our ﬁrst goal is to document these trajectories
of change using extended longitudinal data.
To more fully understand differences in the tra-
jectories of school engagement, it is also important
to examine the individual characteristics of adoles-
cents that may inﬂuence trajectories of change in
school engagement. As a ﬁrst step toward this
understanding, our second goal is to assess the
association of gender and race or ethnicity with
adolescents’ school engagement over the secondary
school years.
Gender is related to school engagement, with
girls reporting high levels of school engagement
(Meece, Glienke, & Burg, 2006; Sirin & Rogers-Sirin,
2005), high levels of subjective valuing of learning
(Eccles et al., 1993), greater extracurricular partici-
pation, and fewer school behavior problems (Mar-
tin, 2004), whereas boys feel more negative about
school and are less likely to report school attach-
ment in middle school (Voelkl, 1997; Wang, 2009).
Taken together, these patterns reﬂect consistent
gender differences in the three types of school
engagement, but it is unclear whether these differ-
ences are consistent across the secondary school
years and whether gender moderates the trajecto-
ries of changes in school engagement.
There is evidence that African American stu-
dents are not performing as well academically as
their European American counterparts. Researchers
have suggested that racial barriers and lack of
accessibility cause African American students to
perceive school and related academic aspirations as
unimportant or unattainable, leading to their aca-
demic
disengagement
from
school
(Mickelson,
1990; Ogbu, 2003). Research on school engagement,
however, has produced mixed evidence on racial or
ethnic differences (Ainsworth-Darnell & Downey,
1998; Sirin & Rogers-Sirin, 2005). In Johnson et al.
(2001), African American students reported lower
levels of school attachment but were more likely to
pay attention and complete homework. In contrast,
Ainsworth-Darnell and Downey’s (1998) analysis of
students in the National Education Longitudinal
Study (NELS) found that African American stu-
dents reported spending less time on homework
than European American students. In Voelkl (1997),
African American students had higher levels of
school identiﬁcation (sense of belonging and valu-
ing
school)
than
European American
students.
Moreover, many of the existing studies on racial or
ethnic
differences
in
school
engagement
and
achievement confound ethnicity with social class
due to marked ethnic group differences in the dis-
tribution of social class within each group and the
different historical reasons for variations in social
class across different ethnic groups (Harris, 2006).
These mixed results therefore underscore the need
for a more rigorous examination of how school
engagement trajectories may differ as a function of
race or ethnicity.
The Impact of Social Support on Students’ Engagement
in School
In general, researchers argue that school engage-
ment declines over the course of an adolescent’s
academic career, in part, due to changes in the
social context that adolescents experience as they
move into and through secondary school (e.g., lar-
ger school, less teacher–student interaction, and
shifts in social support from teachers, peers, and
parents; Wang & Holcombe, 2010). In support of
this argument, social environments that are sensi-
tive
to
adolescents’
developmental
needs
(e.g.,
relatedness, autonomy) have been associated with
increased achievement motivations, behaviors, and
emotions, whereas environments that are at odds
with the developmental needs of young adolescents
have been associated with a decline in academic
achievement and engagement (Eccles et al., 1993).
However, such work has primarily addressed the
middle school years only and has focused on a lim-
ited range of school characteristics. Our third goal
is to investigate whether social supports modify the
shape of individuals’ trajectories of school engage-
ment across the secondary school years.
According to Brofenbrenner’s (2005) bio-ecologi-
cal theory of human development, although general
social environments set the stage for development,
it is the proximal processes within the environment
that are the primary mechanisms through which
developmental outcomes are produced. These prox-
imal processes such as interpersonal relationships
and social support can either promote or hinder
adolescents’ ability to achieve desired outcomes

(Bowen, Rose, Powers, & Glennie, 2008). By and
large, the literature suggests that positive social
support will facilitate school engagement, particu-
larly if the social partners encourage engagement.
However, few studies have looked at different
sources of social support in relation to different
dimensions of school engagement, and no studies
have looked at whether social support can protect
against the normative declines in school engage-
ment over the course of adolescence.
Through their actions in the school or classroom,
teachers can convey a sense of caring, respect, and
appreciation for their students that may lead to stu-
dents’ greater engagement in school. Teacher social
support predicts a range of indicators of behavioral,
emotional, and cognitive engagement (Wang &
Holcombe, 2010). Students who feel supported
socially by teachers tend to exhibit greater compli-
ance with a teacher’s expectations, which, in turn,
should reduce their involvement in distractive and
deviant behaviors (Birch & Ladd, 1997; Garnefski &
Diekstra, 1996). Increased teacher social support
also leads to increases in students’ liking of school
and
improves
students’
achievement
outcomes
(Roeser, Eccles, & Sameroff, 1998). Students who
perceive their teachers to be caring report feelings
of ‘‘school belongingness’’ (Roeser, Midgley, &
Urdan, 1996) as well as increased interest and
enjoyment in school (Wentzel, 1998). In addition,
when students feel socially supported by teachers,
they are more likely to focus on mastery goals as
well as experience lower levels of task engagement
anxiety (Stipek, 2002).
Peer social support is critical during adolescence.
Feelings of peer support and acceptance fulﬁll ado-
lescents’ need for relatedness and help them to
develop a sense of satisfaction in school. Friend-
ships characterized by positive features (self-disclo-
sure, prosocial behavior, and support) are linked to
increased involvement in school whereas friend-
ships typiﬁed by negative features (conﬂict and
rivalry) are associated with disengagement from
school (Berndt & Keefe, 1995; Kurdek & Sinclair,
2000). Students with positive peer relationships at
school
are
more
behaviorally
and
emotionally
engaged in school (Garcia-Reid, 2007). In contrast,
peer rejection increases the risk for misconduct, and
lower participation and interest in school (French &
Conrad, 2001). Although few studies have looked at
the role of peer social support on cognitive engage-
ment, there is evidence to suggest that adolescents
develop both conﬁdence and competence in discuss-
ing points of view and critiquing each other’s work
when they feel peer acceptance for academic accom-
plishment (Guthrie & Wigﬁeld, 2000). Thus, we
expect that peer social support will be associated
positively with subjective valuing of learning.
Parental social support can foster adolescents’
school outcomes (Eccles, Wigﬁeld, & Schiefele,
1998; Simons-Morton & Chen, 2009). A variety of
elements of the family context are related to school
engagement including a child’s feelings of related-
ness to the parents, positive parent-child inter-
actions, and the parenting style adopted (Steinberg,
1996).
Adolescents
from
supportive
homes
are
more likely to be involved in prosocial activities, to
be interested in and actively participate in school,
and to avoid getting into trouble at school (Ander-
son, Sabatelli, & Kosutic, 2007; Wang, Dishion,
Stormshak, & Willett, 2011). Firm but receptive
parenting is positively connected to adolescents’
academic engagement and success, whereas hostile
parenting
is
associated
with
poorer
academic
grades and task oriented beliefs and behaviors
(Furrer & Skinner, 2003; Wolley & Bowen, 2007).
Furthermore, adolescents’ perceptions of support
and care from parents enhance both academic moti-
vation
and
mastery
goal
orientations—both
of
which are linked to cognitive engagement (Wentzel,
1998).
Current research on group differences as a mod-
erator of social support effects on student engage-
ment is equivocal. For example, although girls and
boys perceive different levels of support from
teachers and parents in school, teacher and parental
support has similar positive effects on academic
adjustment for both genders (Rueger, Malecki, &
Demaray, 2010). Research suggests that boys are
more likely to base their friendships around shared
tasks while girls are more apt to establish intimacy
in their friendships (McNelles & Connolly, 1999).
Girls tend to seek social support as a coping strat-
egy, whereas boys tend to adopt avoidance as a
coping strategy (Frydenberg & Lewis, 1993). These
ﬁndings suggest that peer social support might
play a more signiﬁcant role in school engagement
of girls than boys.
There has been mixed evidence regarding racial
or ethnic differences when examining social sup-
port in relation to academic outcomes. Some stud-
ies report no racial or ethnic differences in the
relation between school social climate characterized
by teacher and peer support and students’ aca-
demic adjustment (Harris, 2006; Smerdon, 1999).
Shin, Daly, and Vera (2007) found that among a
racially diverse sample of seventh and eighth grad-
ers, peer inﬂuences were signiﬁcantly related to
school
engagement
across
different
ethnicities.

Other researchers have found that the impact of
positive
relationships
with
teachers
on
school
engagement is stronger for African American stu-
dents than for European American students (Dow-
ney & Ainsworth-Darnell, 2002; Ferguson & Mehta,
2004). Graham, Taylor, and Hudley (1998) also
revealed that African American adolescents tend to
value and show preference for low-achieving peers
over high-achieving peers, which may lead to their
lower academic efforts and engagement compared
to European American adolescents. To date, no
study, however, has employed a multidimensional
construct of school engagement to examine poten-
tial moderation effects of gender and racial/ethnic
group on the relation between provision of social
support and school engagement.
Although each group of social support providers
has been linked with indicators of adolescents’
developmental
outcomes,
there
is
very
little
research examining how the three sources of social
support predict indicators of school engagement
simultaneously. It is unclear which social factors or
combinations of factors have the most inﬂuence on
each type of engagement. Moreover, because very
few studies have examined whether social support
from teachers, peers, or parents interact in the pre-
diction of school engagement, it remains unclear
whether the effect of social support is additive or
multiplicative (e.g., Does it matter whether a stu-
dent perceives one, two, or three of these providers
as highly supportive?). Thus, we seek to under-
stand the relative and additive inﬂuence of social
support from teachers, peers, and parents on spe-
ciﬁc aspects of school engagement longitudinally
over the secondary school years.
The Current Study
Our purpose is to bring a multidimensional and
developmental perspective to the study of school
engagement, using longitudinal data to explore
individual trajectories of school engagement over
the secondary school years. The speciﬁc research
questions are:
1. What are the patterns of growth in adoles-
cents’
perceived
school
engagement
(i.e.,
school compliance, participation in extracurric-
ular activities, school identiﬁcation, and sub-
jective valuing of learning) from 7th through
11th grades?
2. Do the patterns of growth in school engage-
ment differ by adolescents’ gender and race or
ethnicity ?
3. Does social support from teachers, peers, and
parents reduce the rate of decline commonly
reported in studies of school engagement?
Does either gender or race or ethnicity moder-
ate the association between social support and
school engagement?
Based on research reviewed earlier, we predict
that school compliance, participation in extracurric-
ular activities, school identiﬁcation, and subjective
valuing of learning will decrease across the second-
ary school years. Regarding gender and race or eth-
nicity, we predict that girls will display higher
levels of school engagement at all grade levels and
less decline in school engagement than boys over
time. We treat the race or ethnicity analyses as
exploratory in the absence of a strong empirical
basis. Finally, we predict that social support from
teachers, peers, and parents will be associated with
higher initial levels of and reduced decreases in the
four types of school engagement. We have no pre-
dictions regarding the moderating role of gender
and race or ethnicity on the strength of these associ-
ations due to the absence of a strong empirical
basis.
Method
Sample
The sample was part of an ongoing longitudinal
study that was designed to examine the inﬂuence
of social contexts on adolescent development. Par-
ticipants were recruited from 23 schools in a single
large and ethnically diverse county near Washing-
ton, DC. A total of 1,961 families expressed an
interest in the study by signing a form permitting
use to contact them. A subsample of 1,472 families
was selected to participate on the basis of a strati-
ﬁed sampling procedure designed to obtain a rep-
resentative sample of families from each of the 23
middle schools. To examine sampling bias, the dis-
trict provided selected data on all students in the
district during the study years (N = 25,627), includ-
ing students who joined the school system partway
through the year and those from whom we did not
receive parental consent. Cook and his colleagues
evaluated the differences between our sample and
the data for the entire district. They found only two
signiﬁcant differences across a full range of socio-
demographic and school achievement data: Our
sample has a small underrepresentation of males
and
students
who
were
receiving
subsidized
lunches; these differences amounted to less than 0.1

of a standard deviation. Thus, although not a ran-
dom sample, very little systematic bias was evident
in a comparison of this sample and the larger full
community sample from which the participants
were drawn and it did not lead to nonrepresented
values at the extreme of ranges (see Cook, Herman,
Phillips, & Setterstein, 2002, for details).
Study participants have been measured at ﬁve
points in time, ranging from early adolescence (7th
grade) through young adulthood (3 years after high
school graduation). In this study, we examine data
from three of the ﬁve waves of data: Wave 1 col-
lected when the adolescents were in 7th grade
(mean age = 12.9 years), Wave 2 collected during
the fall when the adolescents were making the tran-
sition from 8th to 9th grade (mean age = 14.3
years), and Wave 3 collected when most of the ado-
lescents
were
in
11th
grade
(mean
age = 17.2
years). The investigators used a mixture of self-
administered
questionnaires,
face-to-face
inter-
views, and school records to collect the data. In this
study, we used reports from the target youth, the
teacher, and the primary caregiver, who was most
often the youth’s mother.
Of these respondents, approximately 54% were
African American, 36% were European American,
and 10% were either biracial or other ethnic minori-
ties. In this study, we used only data of the African
American and European American target adoles-
cents from Wave 1 (N = 1,479), Wave 2 (N = 1,057),
and Wave 3 (N = 1,054) because the other ethnic
groups were too small to be included in the analy-
ses. Additionally, approximately 52% of the stu-
dents
were
females.
The
sample
is
broadly
representative of different socioeconomic levels,
with
the
mean
pretax,
family
annual
income
between $45,000 and $49,999 (range = $5,000 to
> $75,000) and 86% of primary caregivers reported
being employed. Fifty-four percent of primary care-
givers were high school graduates and 40% were
college graduates. Furthermore, the range of our
socioeconomic status (SES) indicators was approxi-
mately the same for both the African American and
European American families, thus eliminating the
usual confound between race or ethnicity and social
class found in many studies.
Both Waves 2 and 3 retained 89% and 81% of the
sample from Wave 1, respectively. To ascertain
whether the students who dropped out of the study
in Wave 2 and Wave 3 differed from the students
who participated in all three waves, a series of
independent contingency table analyses and t tests
were conducted with all study variables at Wave 1.
The results revealed that those who participated in
the study for all three waves did not differ from
those who dropped out of the study.
Procedures
Seventh graders were recruited through letters to
their families. Those families interested in partici-
pating in the study were asked to sign and return a
consent form. Students’ advisory teachers were also
asked to participate in this study. Advisory teachers
promote school connectedness and provide aca-
demic counseling to the same students for at least a
year. Ninety-seven percent of students’ advisory
teachers agreed to participate (N = 135). Data were
collected through self-administered questionnaires
and individual face-to-face interviews with adoles-
cents and their primary caregivers for Waves 1, 2,
and 3. This data collection took place in the home of
the
adolescent,
with
the
race
or
ethnicity
of
the interviewers—primarily women with bachelor’s
degrees—matching the race or ethnicity of the adoles-
cents. The face-to-face interviews took approximately
1 hr, and the self-administered questionnaire took
approximately 30 min to complete. Participating ado-
lescents were given $20 at each wave of data collec-
tion. During the same testing periods, advisory
teachers completed separate assessments of their rela-
tionship and classroom interactions for each of their
student advisees in our study.
Measures
School engagement. Using the student self-report
items available in the data set, we developed indexes
for adolescents’ perceptions of school engagement in
7th, 9th, and 11th grades. These scales have been
shown to be both reliable and valid in prior research
(Wang, Willett, & Eccles, 2011). Four constructs were
conﬁrmed to underline the 19 items measuring
adolescents’ school engagement.
School compliance. The construct of school com-
pliance was drawn from the work of Elliott, Huiz-
inga,
and
Menard
(1989).
This
scale
was
the
average of ﬁve items that measured the extent to
which the students engaged in misconduct and had
trouble getting homework done like: ‘‘During the
past 6 months, how often have you (a) skipped
class? (b) had trouble getting homework done? (c)
disrupted the class? (d) been involved in a physical
ﬁght? and (e) been sent to ofﬁce?’’ Each question
on this measure was rated along a 5-point scale,
ranging from 1 (almost never) to 5 (almost always).
Item responses for the items were reverse coded so
that higher scores indicate greater levels of school

compliance. This measure demonstrated good inter-
nal consistency at each of the three time points
(as = .77, .75, .76, at Grades 7, 9, and 11, respec-
tively).
Participation in extracurricular activities. The con-
struct of participation in extracurricular activities
was drawn from the work of Eccles and Barber
(1999). This scale was the mean of four items that
measured the level to which the adolescents partici-
pated in extracurricular activities (e.g., ‘‘During the
last year, how often did you spend time on school
activities?’’ ‘‘athletic or sports teams?’’ ‘‘volunteer
services?’’ and ‘‘scouts or school clubs?’’). Each
item was rated along a 6-point scale, ranging from
1 (less than once a month) to 6 (usually everyday). This
measure demonstrated good internal consistency at
each of the three time points (as = .77, .75, .74, at
Grades 7, 9, and 11, respectively).
School identiﬁcation. The construct of school iden-
tiﬁcation
measured
students’
sense
of
school
belonging and valuing of education by using items
from the Michigan Study of Adolescent Life Transi-
tions (MSALT; Eccles et al., 1993), items from the
work of Mickelson (1990), and items from the Phila-
delphia Study (Furstenberg, Cook, Eccles, Elder, &
Sameroff, 1999). This scale was the mean of seven
items that asked students to rate their feelings
about school, the degree to which they felt part of
their school, and the degree to which they felt it
was important to go to school (e.g., ‘‘In general, I
like school a lot’’; ‘‘I have to do well in school if I
want to be a success in life’’). The item responses
ranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).
This scale yielded good internal consistency at each
time point (as = .74, .74, .76, at Grades 7, 9, and 11,
respectively).
Subjective valuing of learning. The construct of
subjective valuing of learning was the mean of
three items that measured adolescents’ perceived
motivation focusing on learning, personal improve-
ment, and mastery of content and tasks. This mea-
sure was created by Eccles and her colleagues for
MSALT. Sample items are ‘‘I go to school because I
enjoy my classes,’’ ‘‘I go to school because learning
makes me smart,’’ and ‘‘I go to school because I like
what I am learning.’’ Adolescents rated how impor-
tant from 1 (not an important reason) to 7 (a very
important reason) each of these reasons is to them.
This measure yielded good internal consistency at
each of the three time points (as = .75, .76, .82, at
Grades 7, 9, and 11, respectively).
Teacher social support. A four-item scale from tea-
cher self-report developed for the MSALT was used
to assess teacher social support: (a) ‘‘How often do
you help this student out when he or she has a per-
sonal or social problem at school?’’ (b) ‘‘How often
do you talk to this student about how things are
going in his or her life?’’ (c) ‘‘How often do you
really understand how this student feels?’’ (d)
‘‘How often do you really respect this student’s
opinions?’’ Each question on this scale were rated
along a 5-point scale, ranging from 1 (almost never)
to 5 (almost always) and these items were averaged
for a scale score. This measure demonstrated good
internal consistency at each of the three time points
(as = .80, .70, .73, at Grades 7, 9, and 11, respec-
tively).
Peer social support. A four-item scale assessing an
adolescent’s perceived level of peer acceptance and
social support was drawn from items created by
Eccles and Barber (1999) for the MSALT: (a) ‘‘How
often do you and your friends talk about how
things are going in your life?’’ (b) ‘‘How often do
you talk to your friends about how things are going
with your parents?’’ (c) ‘‘How often do you talk
with your friends about your plans for the future?’’
(d) ‘‘How often do you talk with your friends about
problems
you
are
having
in
school?’’
Item
responses for the scale ranged from 1 (almost never)
to 5 (almost always) and were averaged to create a
scale score. This scale yielded good internal consis-
tency at each of the three time points (as = .78, .82,
.80, at Grades 7, 9, and 11, respectively).
Parent social support. A six-item scale from par-
ent self-report was used to assess parental social
support: (a) ‘‘How often do your child and you talk
about what is going on in his or her life?’’ (b) ‘‘Talk
about things are going with his or her friends?’’ (c)
‘‘Talk about his or her plans for future?’’ (d) ‘‘Talk
about problems he or she is having at school?’’ (e)
‘‘Talk about future jobs he or she might have?’’ (f)
‘‘Talk about what courses he or she should take in
school and how these courses will prepare him or
her for these future jobs?’’ Each question on this
scale was rated along a 5-point scale, ranging from
1 (almost never) to 5 (almost always) and items were
averaged to create a scale score. This measure
yielded good internal consistency at each of the
three time points (as = .74, .77, .70, at Grades 7, 9,
and 11, respectively).
Demographic variables. Sociodemographic charac-
teristics of the participating adolescents and their
families were used as statistical controls. These
measures included adolescents’ gender (0 = girl,

total family income before taxes and educational
attainment (in years). In addition, as an indicator of
prior academic ability, adolescents’ standardized
test scores on the California Achievement Test
taken during their third- and ﬁfth-grade school
year served as a statistical control for prior aca-
demic achievement.
Data Analysis
To investigate how adolescents’ school engage-
ment changed from Grades 7 to 11, and how this
change differed depending on adolescents’ gen-
der, race, or ethnicity, and social support, we
used multilevel growth modeling (Raudenbush &
Bryk, 2002). All analyses were conducted by using
HLM, full information maximum-likelihood esti-
mation (Bryk & Raudenbush, 1992). The Level 1
model
(within-person)
described
individual
change over time in adolescents’ engagement out-
comes.
The
Level
2
model
(between
person)
described how these individual changes vary by
demographic characteristics. To answer our three
research questions, we conducted the following
steps. First, we examined the empirical growth
trajectories for all adolescents over time in order
to
identify
an
appropriate
Level
1
model
to
describe the growth trajectories of individual ado-
lescent. After testing a variety of possible speciﬁ-
cations, we found that the best ﬁtting Level 1
speciﬁcation for school engagement included lin-
ear components only.

þ eijðLevel 1: School EngagementÞ
ð1Þ
p0i ¼ c00 þ f0i
p1i ¼ c10 þ f1i
ð2Þ
In Equation 1, Yij represents the intended out-
come for adolescent i at time j. By centering time
metric at Grade 7, the individual growth parame-
ters have the following interpretations: p0i repre-
sents adolescent i’s true scores in the outcome at
Grade 7, and p1i represents adolescent i’s true rate
of growth over time. The Level 2 models treated
the individual growth parameters from Level 1 as
outcomes that enabled us to examine whether ado-
lescents differed in their initial status, or rates of
change, and if so, what predicted that variation.
The
Level
2
speciﬁcations
were
unconditional
growth models which included no substantive pre-
dictors and allow each Level 1 parameters to vary
randomly around its population.
Second, we added gender and race or ethnicity
variables, along with their interactions with grade,
to the unconditional growth model to examine
whether the developmental course of adolescents’
school engagement varied with respect to adoles-
cent gender and race or ethnicity.
Finally, to examine whether changes in social
support predicted changes in adolescent school
engagement, we ﬁt the following model:

ð4Þ
In addition to the intercept and linear change
parameters in the general Level 1 model, the three
time-varying social support predictors were added
to the models one at a time ﬁrst to examine the
individual effects of adolescents’ exposure to these
supportive conditions. Only the signiﬁcant time-
varying predictors were selected to move into the
next phase of the model-building process. We then
simultaneously entered all signiﬁcant predictors
into the Level 1 equations in order to examine the
associations between changes in social support and
changes
in
school
engagement,
controlling
for
demographic characteristics (Bryk & Raudenbush,
1992). The three time-varying social support vari-
ables were grand mean centered, which ensured
that adding these variables did not change the
meaning of the other coefﬁcients in the model (Rau-
denbush & Bryk, 2002). In addition, three variables
representing each adolescent’s mean over time for
social support from teacher, peer, and parent (7th–
11th grades), centered around the grand mean,
were added into the Level 2 equations. By doing
so, both the within-person relations between social
support and school engagement (Level 1) and the
between-person differences in initial status and
growth in school engagement associated with social
support (Level 2) were examined. As a last step, we
tested cross-level interactions between the Level 2
adolescent characteristics and each of the time-
varying predictors. This step was undertaken to
Social Support
883

----- Page 8 (native) -----
determine whether certain characteristics of the
adolescent (gender and race or ethnicity) moder-
ated the associations between social support and
school engagement outcomes. All two-way interac-
tions among the three social support sources in the
prediction of adolescents’ school engagement were
also examined.
To account for students nested in schools, we
included a school level (a third level) so that the
analysis can take into account the particular school
that students attend and produce correctly adjusted
standard error in the model estimations. However,
when running models with the school level, results
were consistent with those reported with two-level
models, and the variance components in the school
level were not statistically signiﬁcant. Thus, to sim-
plify the presentation, we present two-level model
analyses in this study.
Results
Table 1 provides the means, standard deviations,
and correlations for each domain of the social sup-
port and the school engagement outcomes. Among
the ﬁndings, teacher social support, peer social sup-
port, and parent social support were positively
correlated with each other, and all of them were
positively correlated with school compliance, par-
ticipation in extracurricular activities, school identi-
ﬁcation, and subjective valuing of learning, with
the exception that peer social support was nega-
tively associated with school compliance.
Average Trajectories of School Engagement
The results for the ﬁrst two research questions
are summarized for each outcome separately in
Tables 2–5. Model 1 in Tables 2–5 presents the
results of ﬁtting the unconditional growth model.
Model 2 in Tables 2–5 presents the results of ﬁtting
the growth model controlling for demographic
characteristics.
Growth in school compliance. The result of the
unconditional growth model suggested decline of
school compliance over time (see Table 2, Model 1).
There were gender and racial or ethnic differences
in seventh-grade level of school compliance but not
in the rate of change (see Table 2, Model 2). Boys
and African American adolescents reported less
school compliance than did girls and European
American adolescents respectively in seventh grade.

of grade was statistically signiﬁcant, indicating
decline of participation of extracurricular activities
from 7th to 11th grades. The intercept (but not the
slope) differed by gender: Boys participated in less
extracurricular activities than did girls in 7th grade.
There were racial or ethnic differences in intercept,
but we found no racial or ethnic differences in the
growth of participation of extracurricular activities
over time (see Table 3, Model 2). European Ameri-
can adolescents reported higher levels of participa-
tion in extracurricular activities than did African
American adolescents in 7th grade.
Growth in school identiﬁcation. The unconditional
growth model suggested that adolescents experi-
enced a decrease in school identiﬁcation from 7th
to 11th grades (see Table 4, Model 1). There were
gender and racial or ethnic differences in the inter-
cept of school identiﬁcation (see Table 4, Model 2).
Boys reported lower levels of school identiﬁcation
than did girls in 7th grade. African American ado-
lescents reported higher levels of school identiﬁca-
tion than did European American adolescents in
7th grade. There were no gender or racial or ethnic
differences in the growth of school identiﬁcation.
Growth in subjective valuing of learning. For the
average adolescent, subjective valuing decreased
from 7th to 11th grades (see Table 5, Model 1).
There were gender differences in 7th-grade level
and growth of subjective valuing of learning (see
Table 5, Model 2). Boys had lower levels of subjec-
tive valuing than did girls in 7th grade, and the
gender differences in subjective valuing increased
over time. Compared to European American ado-
lescents, African American adolescents reported
higher subjective valuing in 7th grade, but there
were no racial or ethnic differences in the rate of
growth.
Effects of Social Support on Adolescent School
Engagement
Based on Model 2 in Tables 2–5, the three social
support predictors were added to the models one
at a time to examine the individual effects of ado-
lescents’ exposure to these supportive conditions.
Models 3, 4, and 5 in Tables 2–5 present the indi-
vidual effect of each source of social support on

Social Support
885

----- Page 10 (native) -----
Tables 2–5 presents the ﬁnal parsimonious model,
which shows the effect of social support predictors
on initial status and the rate of change in adolescent
engagement outcomes.
Effect
of
social
support
on
school
compli-
ance. Increases in social support from teachers and
parents were related to higher school compliance
from 7th to 11th grades (see Table 2, Model 6). The
standardized effect sizes (d), calculated according to
Raudenbush and Xiao-Feng (2001), suggest that a
standard deviation increase in teacher social sup-
port and parental social support was linked to a
reduced rate of decline of 0.37 and 0.41 SD in ado-
lescents’
school
compliance,
respectively.
Thus,
such support protected against the normative rate
of decline in school compliance. However, contrary
to our hypothesis, a standard deviation increase in
peer social support was related to a faster decrease
of 0.28 SD in school compliance. There were no
gender or racial or ethnic differences in the associa-
tions between social support and school compli-
ance. Teacher social support and parent social
support had similar protective effects on adolescent
school compliance, and none of the two-way inter-
actions between the three time-varying social sup-
port predictors were signiﬁcant. According to the
pseudo-R2, we conclude that 35% of the within-per-
son variation in school compliance was explained
by
social
support.
The
residual
variance
was
reduced by 43% for the intercept and by 36% for
the slope.
Additional analyses for peer support. We specu-
lated in the introduction that the inﬂuence of peer
social support on school engagement might vary
depending on the type of peers one has. The nega-
tive association between peer social support and
school compliance could reﬂect the impact of peers
on different groups of adolescents. It is plausible
that those adolescents who report low levels of
school compliance are primarily getting negative
input from their antisocial peer group, while those
reporting more school compliance are adolescents
who are getting largely positive encouragement for
positive behaviors from the nondelinquent peer
group. To investigate this possibility, we separated
the sample into two groups based on the type of
peers—positive peers or negative peers—they con-
sider to be their best friends.

Adolescents were categorized in the positive
peer group if they reported having more good
friends with prosocial values and in the negative
peer group if they reported having more friends
with antisocial values. We found a positive associa-
tion between peer social support and school com-
pliance for the group with positive peers (b = .036,
p = .06, d = 0.42) and conversely a negative associa-
tion
between
peer
social
support
and
school
compliance for the group with negative peers
(b = ).092, p < .001, d = 0.49). These ﬁndings indicate
that prosocial and antisocial friends have different
impacts on adolescents’ school compliance.
Effect of social support on participation in extracur-
ricular activities. Adolescents were more likely to
participate in extracurricular activities when they
experienced increased support from their peers and
parents from 7th through 11th grades (see Table 3,
Model 6). A standard deviation increase in parental
social support and peer social support was associ-
ated with a reduced decrease of 0.50 and 0.72 SD in
participation in extracurricular activities, respec-
tively. Thus, having social support from these
sources protects against the normative declines in
participation
in
extracurricular
activities.
There
were no signiﬁcant two-way interactions among the
social support predictors. The pseudo-R2 indicates
that 23% of the within-person variation in extracur-
ricular activities participation was explained by
social support. The residual variance was reduced
by 31% for the intercept and by 22% for the slope.
Effect of social support on school identiﬁcation. As
shown in Table 4, Model 6, adolescents were more
likely to identify themselves with schools when
they had increased social support from teachers,
peers, and parents from 7th to 11th grades. With
1 SD increase in teacher support, peer support,
and parental support, adolescents experienced a
reduced decrease of 0.58, 0.54, and 0.40 SD in
school
identiﬁcation,
respectively.
Thus,
once
again having these sources of social support pro-
tected against the normative declines in school

action, with the association between peer social
support and school identiﬁcation being stronger
for African American adolescents (d = 0.20). After
including social support predictors, the residual
variance was reduced by 39% for the within-per-
son level, 23% for the intercept, and 28% for the
slope in school identiﬁcation.
Effect of social support on subjective valuing of learn-
ing. Increases
in
social
support
from
teachers,
peers, and parents were associated with reduced
decreases in subjective task value from 7th to 11th
grades (see Table 5, Model 6). A 1 SD increase in
teacher support, peer support, and parental support
reduced the decline of adolescents’ subjective valu-
ing of learning by 0.42, 0.24, and 0.38 SD, respec-
tively. Therefore, having these sources of social
support protects against the normative declines in
the subjective valuing of learning. There were no
gender
differences
in
the
associations
between
social support and subjective valuing of learning
and no two-way interactions among the social sup-
port predictors. The signiﬁcant interaction of race
or ethnicity by peer social support indicated that
the positive impact of peer social support on sub-
jective valuing of learning was stronger for African
Americans than European Americans (d = 0.28).
The pseudo-R2 indicates that 30% of the within-per-
son variation in subjective valuing of learning was
explained by social support. The residual variance
was reduced by 34% for the intercept and by 25%
for the slope.

of learning at school decreased from 7th to 11th
grades. These declines may result from the potential
mismatch between the youth’s stage of develop-
ment and the opportunities provided in the second-
ary school environment (Eccles et al., 1993). For
instance, in comparison to elementary schools, mid-
dle and high schools are more departmentalized,
larger, and more performance oriented—resulting
in more social comparison grading standards and
fewer opportunities to develop strong and positive
personal relationships between school adults and
students, and to participate in extracurricular activi-
ties at a time when adolescents need strong nonfa-
milial social relationships and opportunities to feel
competent at their school work (Eccles et al., 1993).
If, on average, students are provided with fewer
opportunities to feel competent in their academic
subjects, then the subjective valuing of learning are
likely to drop. Similarly, if, on average, students
have fewer opportunities to have strong, positive
relationships with teachers, then their identiﬁcation
with school and school compliance will decline.
Gender Differences in School Engagement
Also
as
hypothesized,
girls
reported
higher
levels of school compliance, participation in extra-
curricular
activities,
school
identiﬁcation,
and
subjective valuing of learning than boys in seventh
grade (Voelkl, 1997). Girls’ engagement with school
may reﬂect a greater concern on their part for aca-
demic performance, perhaps as a result of gender
socialization processes and differential expectations
of parents and teachers (Eccles, 2007; Wilkinson &
Marrett, 1985). For instance, parents tend to moni-
tor girls’ progress more closely, correct girls’ mis-
takes, and make decisions for girls more than they
do for boys (Bumpus, Crouter, & McHale, 2001).
Such practices may communicate to girls, more so
than to boys, the importance of regulating their
progress toward their goals, and putting effort into
meeting their goals as a way to attend to parents.
Similarly, teachers often respond differently to boys
and girls in the classrooms in ways that may lead
students to believe that certain behavior patterns
associated with their gender are expected by their
teachers (Eccles, 2007). Girls may be expected to
display more emotional connectedness to school
than boys, whereas boys may believe that it is not
socially acceptable to admit having high levels of
connectedness to school (Bembenutty, 2007). These
gender biases and beliefs favoring girls may lead
girls in the seventh grade to engage in school more
than boys. However, our ﬁndings indicate that
although girls experience higher levels of school
engagement in the seventh grade, girls and boys
experience similar decline rates on the three dimen-
sions of school engagement. It therefore seems that
these gender biases and beliefs do not prevent girls
from disengaging from secondary school once they
enter this system.
Racial ⁄Ethnic Differences in School Engagement
Like several other studies (Johnson et al., 2001;
Voelkl, 1997), African American youth in this study
reported higher initial levels of school identiﬁcation
and subjective valuing of learning but lower levels
of school compliance than European American ado-
lescents. The results may reﬂect both the popula-
tions being studied and the historical period in
which the work was done. This study was conducted
in a largely middle-class, majority African American
county in the 1990s. Many of the African American
families had moved into this county recently in
response to expanded professional job opportunities
in Washington, DC. The political systems in the
county were largely controlled by African Ameri-
cans. Thus, the youth had many examples of the
beneﬁts of education for adult occupational success.
Thus, the African American youth in this study
believe that education may pay off in terms of adult
occupational opportunities (Eccles, Wong, & Peck,
2006). In fact, the parents of the African American
adolescents in this study stressed exactly this mes-
sage (Gutman & Eccles, 2007).
Regarding
behavioral
engagement,
African
American students reported lower levels of compli-
ance with school rules than did European Ameri-
can students. Thus, African American students
reported higher levels of getting into discipline
problems at school at the start of the study. One
possible explanation lies in differential timing of
pubertal development in African American and
European American populations (Michael & Eccles,
2003; Simmons & Blyth, 1987): African Americans
move through pubertal development at a slightly
younger age than European Americans. Both Sim-
mons and Blyth (1987) and Eccles et al. (1993)
found that early maturing students engage in more
school problem behaviors after the transition to
junior high school than do on time or later matur-
ing students. If this is true, then the racial or ethnic
difference we found in initial rates of school prob-
lem behaviors might reﬂect racial or ethnic differ-
ences in pubertal maturation rates. To test this
hypothesis, future studies should include indicators
of pubertal development in order to be able to
Social Support
889

----- Page 14 (native) -----
control for this possible confound with school
transition effects. Another possible explanation lies
in the experiences of racial discrimination at school.
According to Wong, Eccles, and Sameroff (2003),
the African
American
students in this sample
reported higher rates of racial discrimination at
school in the seventh grade, and those students
who reported higher rates of racial discrimination
also reported higher rates of school problem behav-
iors. If this is so, then the small difference in
reported compliance between the two groups in
this study could reﬂect group differences in experi-
ences of racial discrimination at school.
The Role of Social Supports
The multidimensional perspective of engagement
enables us to estimate the unique role each source
of social support plays in different dimensions of
school
engagement.
As
we
expected,
different
sources of social support are not equally important
in their impact on adolescents’ school engagement,
and the effect of these sources differed by the
aspect of school engagement studied. Our results
suggest that supportive teachers play a particularly
important role in reducing the declines in school
compliance, sense of school identiﬁcation, and sub-
jective valuing of learning at school across the sec-
ondary school years. Adolescence is a period when
relationships
with
nonparental
adults
take
on
increased meaning because adolescents are seeking
support and guidance from adults outside of the
home (Murray, 2009; Roeser et al., 1998). In often
large and impersonal secondary school settings,
teachers can support students’ need for relatedness,
as well as their positive engagement with school
through
maintaining
good
quality
relationships
with students and emphasizing a high level of care,
respect, and appreciation in the interaction (Went-
zel, 1998). We ﬁnd these results particularly impor-
tant given the common stereotype that adolescents
are most heavily inﬂuenced by their peers rather
than the adults around them.
Peer social support has a more complex associa-
tion with school engagement. As expected, peer
social support was associated with reduced declines
in participation in extracurricular activities, sense of
school identiﬁcation,
and
subjective valuing of
learning at school. It is noteworthy, however, that
the impact of teacher social support on emotional
and cognitive engagement was greater than peer
social support. This pattern of ﬁndings suggests that
the shift in adolescent social priorities toward peer
relationships is not as universal as is often assumed
to be true. Perceived support from both teachers
and parents is an important buffer against the gen-
eral declines in school engagement found during
the secondary school years. Our results suggest that
most adolescents continue to be inﬂuenced substan-
tially by their teachers and parents when it comes to
school
engagement
even
though
they
may
be
tempted into misbehavior outside of the classroom
by their peers (Smetana, Campione-Barr, & Metzger,
2006).
Findings regarding peer social support yielded a
somewhat
mixed
predictive
association,
with
changes in behavioral engagement depending on
the type of peers the student had as friends. On
average, there was a negative association between
peer social support and school compliance—the
greater the increase in peer social support, the
greater the decrease in school compliance. How-
ever, this association differed when we broke the
students into two groups based on the nature of
their friends. The association between peer support
and behavioral engagement was negative only for
those youth who reported hanging out with anti-
social friends. By contrast, this association was
positive for youth with prosocial friends. Thus, the
unexpected
ﬁnding
of
a
negative
association
between peer support and school compliance likely
reﬂects the impact of different kinds of peers on
different groups of adolescents. It is conceivable
that those adolescents who report low levels of
school compliance are primarily getting negative
input from their antisocial peer group, while those
reporting more school compliance are getting lar-
gely positive encouragement for behavioral engage-
ment
from
their
prosocial
peer
group.
Future
studies should include peer group as a possible
moderator in order to control for differential peer
effects on school engagement.
Peer inﬂuence is especially important to consider
in this study given that the peak in susceptibility
occurs during the middle and high school years
(Jessor, Jill, Vanderryn, Costa, & Turbin, 1995). As
discussed by Luthar and McMahon (1996), peer
social support does not necessarily equate with
afﬁrmation by peer engagement in positive and
socially acceptable behavior. Demands from the
peer group may run counter to school rules. For
instance, behaviors considered ‘‘deviant’’ by main-
stream society may sometimes be endorsed by the
peer group as effective ways to achieve personal
goals and resolve conﬂict. Such behaviors may also
be associated with relatively high prestige and sta-
tus within the immediate subcultural group (Coie
& Jacobs, 1993). Accordingly, this type of support
890
Wang and Eccles

----- Page 15 (native) -----
and comfort from one’s peers may have negative
consequences for behavioral outcomes. Our supple-
mentary analyses support these suggestions. Fur-
thermore,
peer
social
support
was
a
slightly
stronger predictor of behavioral outcomes than both
teacher and parent support. These ﬁndings are con-
sistent with developmental research showing that
during adolescence, peers may be more important
social factors than nonfamilial adults on problem-
atic school behavior (Wentzel, 1998). Thus, across
all of the behavioral components of school engage-
ment, peers are just as likely to exert positive inﬂu-
ences on adolescents as negative inﬂuences.
As predicted, we found positive associations
between parent social support and all indicators of
school engagement. Indeed, parent social support
was an even stronger predictor of three of the four
indicators (participation in extracurricular activities,
school identiﬁcation,
and
subjective valuing of
learning) of school engagement than peer social
support. Adolescents face the challenge of renegoti-
ating their roles and relationships with teachers,
peers, and parents. Although some research demon-
strates that parents’ impact on adolescents decreases
from elementary school to secondary school (Larson
& Richards, 1991; Steinberg & Silverberg, 1986),
other research, including ours, demonstrates that
parents remain a very important source of inﬂuence
throughout adolescence (see Smetana et al., 2006).
Parents are still considered a critical source of social
support for the educational endeavors of youth. Dif-
ferences of research ﬁndings regarding the role of
parents likely reﬂects a focus on different aspects of
adolescents’ behaviors, attitudes, and values.
There were no moderation effects of gender on
the relation between social support and school
engagement. It suggests that the primary positive
effects of social support from teachers, peers, and
parents on the aspects of school engagement exam-
ined in this study are similar across adolescent gen-
der. With respect to racial or ethnic difference, peer
social support was more strongly associated with
increased sense of school identiﬁcation and subjec-
tive valuing of learning among African American
adolescents, indicating that positive peer inﬂuences
serve as a stronger protective or buffering effect
among African American than among European
American adolescents. This may reﬂect the nature
of our sample discussed earlier. In addition, this
ﬁnding may be the result of the higher base levels
of school identiﬁcation and value of learning in
African American adolescents relative to European
American adolescents. African American adoles-
cents’ higher initial status of school identiﬁcation
and subjective value of learning may allow peer
social support to exert a stronger effect on them.
Thus, it is necessary to consider both the extent and
the relative level of change when examining the
social support effects on adolescent school engage-
ment.
The ﬁndings of this study provide support for an
additive model of social support and an explanation
for how social support facilitates positive school
engagement. Although supportive qualities of inter-
personal relationships were signiﬁcant contributors
to behavioral, emotional, and cognitive aspects of
school engagement in the present study, we did not
ﬁnd interactions among the various sources of per-
ceived social support as signiﬁcant predictors of
engagement outcomes. In other words, teachers,
peers, and parents seem to play relatively indepen-
dent roles in adolescents’ development of school
engagement. On the one hand, this pattern of
results is consistent with the interpretation that the
effects of having multiple sources of social support
on school engagement are additive rather than com-
pensatory (Cook et al., 2002; Furstenberg et al.,
1999). On the other hand, the fact that each source
of inﬂuence makes an independent contribution
also reﬂects the fact that one can beneﬁt from the
support available from an individual source even if
support is not forthcoming from multiple sources.
In terms of positive school behaviors, the youth
most at risk are those who have little social support
from their parents and teachers coupled with strong
social support from their peers. In contrast, social
support from one’s teachers and parents can totally
counteract the negative inﬂuence of peer support
on positive behaviors. Thus, in psychological rather
than statistical logic, one could conclude that social
supports in one domain do compensate for lack of
social supports in another domain.
Implications for Prevention and Intervention
The study of engagement as multidimensional
and as an interaction between the individual and
the social environment helps us to better under-
stand the complexity of adolescents’ experiences in
school and to identify antecedents of engagement
that could be the target of interventions. Overall,
the inﬂuence of each source of social support
depended in part on the engagement outcomes
being studied. For promotion of school compliance,
social support from teachers and parents had posi-
tive associations, but peer social support had both
positive and negative inﬂuences depending on
what type of peer groups adolescents afﬁliated
Social Support
891

----- Page 16 (native) -----
with. For participation in extracurricular activities,
both peer and parent support had a positive
impact, whereas teacher support had no signiﬁcant
association. Social support from teachers, peers,
and parents had a positive inﬂuence on school
identiﬁcation as well as the subjective valuing of
learning at school. Therefore, we can conclude from
the analyses reported here that research in the area
of school engagement must include attention to the
multiple social contexts with which adolescents
interact and no single variable will fully or ade-
quately
explain
the
engagement
outcomes;
by
extension, no single intervention will be able to pro-
mote adolescents’ school engagement. Thus, inter-
ventions designed to target speciﬁc engagement
outcomes need to account for different aspects of
adolescents’ social relationships and environment.
School engagement is of particular interest to
researchers not only because it is related to a variety
of important developmental outcomes but also
because it is believed to be malleable and respon-
sive to interactions between the individual and the
social environment (Fredricks et al., 2004). Results
from this study can inform the design and imple-
mentation of interventions to promote adolescents’
school achievement and engagement. More recent
trends in the prevention sciences have reﬂected
growing interest in strength-based rather than deﬁ-
cit-based studies (Moore, Lippman, & Brown, 2004).
Strength-oriented approaches allow researchers and
practitioners to reduce risk and promote youth
assets (e.g., active engagement and social support).
The present study supplements youth development
research by examining the combined effects of mul-
tiple social inﬂuences from the school, peer group,
and family on positive youth development.
Limitations and Conclusions
Several limitations of this study and some cave-
ats need to be noted. First, it is noteworthy that we
collected information about parental and teacher
social support via adult-report measures. The use
of multiple informants to assess social processes
provides a more comprehensive perspective of the
social support. However, this study mainly relies
on
self-report
information
from
adolescents
to
assess school engagement. Although bio-ecological
theory posits that perceptions or experiences (rather
than some notion of objective reality) are key to
understanding individuals’ efforts to adapt to their
social contexts, future use of multiple sources of
information (informants, teachers, and parents) and
multiple methodologies (interviews, observations,
surveys) can provide a more robust, valid method
of identifying school engagement (Fredricks et al.,
2004). Second, the nonexperimental nature of this
study limits our ability to eliminate the prospective
reciprocal relations between social support and
adolescent school engagement. It is possible that
highly
engaged
adolescents
are
simply
well-
adjusted individuals who also enjoy supportive
relationships with their teachers and parents. Thus,
researchers should examine the reciprocal nature of
social support and adolescent engagement out-
comes and conduct experimental trials to make
causal inferences. Finally, the study identiﬁed the
protective roles of speciﬁc aspects of social support
on
various
objective
indicators
of
adolescents’
school
engagement.
However,
little
is
known
regarding processes in terms of how adolescents’
perceived social support inﬂuences their engage-
ment. While longitudinal analyses eliminate ques-
tions concerning the temporal precedence of effects,
it does not exclude the alternative explanation that
a third variable accounts for the relations between
social support and adolescent engagement out-
comes. Thus, future research examining mediators
would extend our understanding of the processes
underlying effects of social support.
Despite its limitations, this study advances our
understanding of school engagement by suggesting
a developmental course of school compliance, par-
ticipation in extracurricular activities, school identi-
ﬁcation, and subjective valuing of learning that are
predicted by social support from teachers, peers, and
parents. The study thus underscores the importance
of studying development of school engagement
within an ecological perspective (Brofenbrenner,
2005). Social contexts in which adolescents are
embedded work differently for adolescents of dif-
ferent genders and ethnicities. School engagement
seems to be inﬂuenced by the proximal process in
the form of interpersonal relationships and social
support and by the resources that adolescents can
draw
on
during
this
process
of
development.
Advancing our knowledge about the complex pro-
cesses and interactions of personal and contextual
factors in school engagement can help teachers and
parents create environments that support adoles-
cents while they navigate challenges and barriers in
their quest for school success and completion.
