Health in Brazil 1
The Brazilian health system: history, advances, and challenges
Jairnilson Paim, Claudia Travassos, Celia Almeida, Ligia Bahia, James Macinko
Brazil is a country of continental dimensions with widespread regional and social inequalities. In this report, we 
examine the historical development and components of the Brazilian health system, focusing on the reform 
process during the past 40 years, including the creation of the Uniﬁ ed Health System. A deﬁ ning characteristic of 
the contemporary health sector reform in Brazil is that it was driven by civil society rather than by governments, 
political parties, or international organisations. The advent of the Uniﬁ ed Health System increased access to health 
care for a substantial proportion of the Brazilian population, at a time when the system was becoming increasingly 
privatised. Much is still to be done if universal health care is to be achieved. Over the past 20 years, there have been 
other advances, including investments in human resources, science and technology, and primary care, and a 
substantial decentralisation process, widespread social participation, and growing public awareness of a right to 
health care. If the Brazilian health system is to overcome the challenges with which it is presently faced, 
strengthened political support is needed so that ﬁ nancing can be restructured and the roles of both the public and 
private sector can be redeﬁ ned.
Introduction
In this report, we examine the organisation, historical 
development, and present state of the Brazilian health 
system. We review published studies and original data 
from oﬃ  cial sources to provide an overview of the 
Brazilian health system and outline future challenges.
Brazil is a federative republic that covers 8·5 million 
km²—or 47% of South America. With an estimated 
population of 190 732 694 in 2010,1 Brazil is the world’s ﬁ fth 
most populous country. Its political system is composed of 
several political parties and three levels of autonomous 
government—federal government, 26 states and a federal 
district, and 5563 municipalities. Brazil is governed by 
means of an independent judiciary, an executive branch 
led by the president, and a bicameral legislature. Brazil 
was a colony of Portugal from the year 1500 onwards and, 
although it gained political independence in 1822, it did 
not become a republic until 1889. Slavery was abolished 
in 1888. The Brazilian population is multi-ethnic; in 2008, 
about half the population self-classiﬁ ed their race or skin 
colour as brown (43·8%) or black (6·8%), and 0·6% 
thought of themselves as indigenous to Brazil.2 In the 
20th century, Brazil underwent rapid industrialisation 
during a time of political instability, military takeovers, and 
author itarian governments, with brief periods of 
democratic rule—Brazil has had its longest period of 
democracy during the past 25 years.
Health sector reform in Brazil was driven by civil 
society rather than by government, political parties, or 
international organisations. The Uniﬁ ed Health System 
(Sistema Único de Saúde; SUS), instituted by the 
1988 constitution, is based on the principle of health as a 
citizen’s right and the state’s duty.
Brazil—a brief overview
Brazil has undergone major political, economic, 
demographic, and social changes in the past 40 years. 
Key messages
• Since 1988, Brazil has developed a dynamic, complex 
health system (the Uniﬁ ed Health System; SUS), which 
is based on the principles of health as a citizen’s right 
and the state’s duty. The SUS aims to provide 
comprehensive, universal preventive and curative care 
through decentralised management and provision of 
health services, and promotes community participation 
at all administrative levels.
• 
The Brazilian Health Sector Reform occurred at the same 
time as democratisation, and was spearheaded by health 
professionals and individuals in civil society movements 
and organisations. 
• 
Implementation of the SUS has been complicated by state 
support for the private sector, the concentration of health 
services in more developed regions, and chronic 
underfunding.
• Despite these limitations, the SUS has managed to 
vastly improve access to primary and emergency 
care, reach universal coverage of vaccination and 
prenatal care, and invest heavily in the expansion of 
human resources and technology, including major 
efforts to produce the country’s most essential 
pharmaceutical needs.
• Future challenges for the SUS include reforming its 
ﬁ nancial structure to ensure universality, equity, and 
long term sustainability, renegotiating public and 
private roles, reshaping the model of care to cater to 
Brazil’s rapid demographic and epidemiological changes, 
and assuring quality of care and the safety of patients.
• 
Ultimately, the challenges facing the SUS are political 
because they cannot be resolved in the technical sphere 
but through only the concerted eﬀ orts of individuals and 
the society.

In 1970, under the military regime, Brazil’s economic 
growth was among the highest in the world, but 
improvements in quality of life disproportionately 
beneﬁ ted the most privileged populations. Although 
democracy was restored in the mid-1980s, during a period 
of economic instability, resumption of economic growth 
and improvement of social protection did not happen 
until the 21st century.
The country is divided into ﬁ ve geographical regions 
(north, northeast, centre-west, southeast, and south; 
ﬁ gure 1) with diﬀ ering demographic, economic, social, 
cultural, and health conditions, and widespread internal 
inequalities. For example, the southeast region covers 
only 11% of Brazil’s territory, but accounts for 43% of the 
population and 56% of gross domestic product. The 
north region, which contains most of the Amazon 
rainforest, has the country’s lowest population density 
(3·9 people per km²) and is the second poorest region, 
after the northeast region.
Between 1970 and 2000, Brazil underwent a demographic 
transition; the proportion of the population older than 
60 years (10% in 2009) doubled and urbanisation increased 
from 55·9% to 80%.1 Fertility rates decreased (5·8 in 1970 
to 1·9 in 2008), as did infant mortality (114 per 
1000 livebirths in 1970 to 19·3 per 1000 livebirths in 2007). 
As a result, life expectancy at birth increased by nearly 
40%, to 72·8 years in 2008 (table 1).
Unemployment in 2007 was low at 8·2%, but many 
(43·8%) workers were employed in the informal 
sector—56% of those employed had social security 
coverage. By 2020, the old-age dependency ratio is 
expected to be 68 people older than 60 years to every 
100 children and adolescents,9 and the proportion of the 
population of age to enter the labour market is expected 
to be larger than ever before.10 School attendance has 
increased since 1990, and illiteracy rates have decreased 
from 33·7% in 1970 to 10·0% in 2008 (table 1).
Between 1991 and 2008, Brazil’s gross domestic product 
doubled and its Gini coeﬃ  cient, although among the 
highest in the world, decreased by 15% from 0·637 
to 0·547.5 The poverty index decreased from 68% in 1970 
to 31% in 2008—this improvement can be attributed to a 
combination of social policies, including the social 
security system, the Bolsa Família conditional cash 
transfer programme (which, in 2008, distributed 
R$13 billion [about US$7·2 billion] among 10·5 million 
families),11 and increases in the legal minimum wage.
Living conditions have also changed substantially. In 
1970, only 33% of households had indoor water, 17% had 
access to sewerage, and less than half had electricity 
(table 2). By 2007, 93% of households had indoor water, 
60% had access to sewerage, and most had access to 
electricity. Ownership of consumer goods has also 
increased; in 2008, more than 90% of households had a 
refrigerator and television, 75% had mobile phones, 
32% had a personal computer, and 80% of Brazilians who 
were 15 years or older reported use of broadband internet.1
Such changes in living conditions have had an eﬀ ect on 
Brazilians’ health and health behaviour. The prevalence 
of overweight and obesity is increasing; 47·3% of men in 
state capitals report being overweight.13,14 About a third of 
families report that they do not have enough food to eat.15 
Although only 19% of adults in state capitals eat enough 
fruit and vegetables (ie, at least ﬁ ve portions of fruit or 
fruit juices and vegetables per day, ﬁ ve or more days per 
week), the quality of peoples’ diet seems to be improving 
with time.16 Physical activity is low in state capitals,2 but 
tobacco use has decreased as a result of the National 
Tobacco Control Programme—in 2008, 17·2% of the 
population smoked, compared with 34·5% in 1989, when 
the programme began. Alcohol misuse is another 
challenge; 17·6% of people aged 15 years or older report 
binge drinking.9
Changes in mortality and morbidity rates are related 
to these demographic, epidemiological, and nutritional 
transitions. Diseases of the circulatory system are the 
leading cause of death, followed by cancer and external 
causes (largely homicides and traﬃ  c accidents).17 
Chronic diseases are the biggest contributor to the 
burden of disease, and communicable diseases, 
although decreasing with time, still aﬀ ect a substantial 
proportion of the population. An estimated 40–50% of 
Brazilians older than 40 years are hypertensive and 
6 million are diabetic,9 representing an enormous

challenge to a health system organised to provide 
predominantly acute care (table 3).22
Geographical and social inequalities in morbidity 
and mortality rates exist. In 2006, the northeast region 
had an infant mortality rate 2·24 times higher than 
that of the south region, although this disparity has 
decreased.4 In Brazil, people who identify their race or 
skin colour as brown or black tend to be from lower 
income and educational groups, and inequalities in 
some health outcomes (such as the prevalence of 
hypertension) exist between people of diﬀ erent race or 
skin colour. However, for other indicators, such as self-
assessed health, outcomes are much the same after 
adjustment for socioeconomic status.23–25 Although race 
and social class are also related in other countries, the 
means by which racial relations in Brazil aﬀ ect health 
are distinct.26
Background to the Brazilian health system
The Brazilian health system consists of a variety of public 
and private organisations that were set up in diﬀ erent 
historical periods (ﬁ gure 2). In the early 1900s, public 
health campaigns, undertaken in an almost military 
fashion, were used to implement public health activities. 
The authoritarian nature of these campaigns brought 
about opposition from parts of the population and some 
politicians and military leaders. Such opposition led to 
the vaccine revolt in 1904, a period of unrest in reaction to 
a compulsory smallpox vaccination campaign sanctioned 
by Oswaldo Cruz, the Director General of public health at 
the time (ﬁ gure 3).24,26 The Brazilian state’s model for 
intervention in social policies dates from the 1920s 
and 1930s, when an individual’s social and civil rights 
were related to their position in the labour market.26
Brazil’s social protection system expanded during the 
Government of President Vargas (1930–45) and the 
military (1964–84). Decision-making and management 
processes were done without public involvement and 
were centralised in large bureaucracies.33 The social 
protection system was fragmented and unequal.34 The 
health system consisted of an underfunded Ministry of 
Health and the social security system, which provided 
medical care through the retirement and pension 
institutes, delivered on the basis of occupational

with casual employment had an inadequate supply of 
public services, philanthropic care, and out-of-pocket

responsibility for provision of health care was extended 
to trade unions, and philanthropic institutions provided 
care for rural workers.35 Direct subsidies to private 
businesses for the provision of health care to their 
employees were replaced by income tax discounts, 
fostering expansion of medical-care supply and 
proliferation of private health-care plans.36 Increased 
social security coverage and a health-care market based 
on fee-for-service payments from private sector providers 
gave rise to a funding crisis in the social security system, 
which, with the economic recession during the 1980s, 
fuelled reform aspirations.37
The Brazilian health sector reform
The health sector reform in Brazil was ideologically at 
odds with the post-welfare health sector reforms 
happening worldwide at that time.38 The Brazilian 
proposal, which began to take shape in the mid-1970s, 
was formed during the struggle to restore democracy. A 
widespread social movement grew,39 bringing together 
initiatives in diﬀ erent sections of society—from 
grassroots sectors to middle-class populations and trade 
unions—and in some cases in conjunction with the 
then-illegal left-wing political parties. The Brazilian 
health reform movement’s political and ideological 
viewpoint was of health not as an exclusively biological 
issue to be resolved by medical services, but as a social 
and political issue to be addressed in public.37,40

and health professionals engaged with grassroots and 
trade union struggles. The Brazilian Health Studies 
Centre (CEBES) was founded in 1976 to organise the 
health reform movement, and in 1979 the Collective 
Health Postgraduate Association (ABRASCO) was 
formed. Both organisations provided an institutional 
basis for leveraging reforms.37
The health reform movement spread and formed an 
alliance with progressive members of congress, municipal 
health, and other social movements. Meetings of 
municipal health oﬃ  cers were held from 1979 onwards, 
and in 1980 the National Council of State Oﬃ  cers 
(CONASS) was constituted.29 
In 1986, the 8th National Health Conference approved 
health as a citizen’s right, laid out the foundations of 
the SUS, and resulted in the development of several 
strategies that allowed for coordination, integration, 
and resource transfers between federal, state, and 
municipal health institutions, administrative changes 
that set the groundwork for future actions by the SUS. 
Then, during the National Constituent Assembly 
(1987–88) the health reform movement and its allies 
secured approval for reform, despite strong opposition 
from a powerful and mobilised private health sector 
(ﬁ gure 2).37,41 The 1988 constitution was proclaimed at a 
time of economic instability, with social movements on 
the retreat, neoliberal ideology spreading, and workers 
losing purchasing power. At the same time as this 
reform, private health companies were reorganising to 
meet the demands of new clients, receiving ﬁ nancial 
support from the government, and consolidating private 
health sector investments.42
The present Brazilian health system
The Brazilian health system is made up of a complex 
network of complementary and competitive service 
providers and purchasers, forming a public–private mix 
that is ﬁ nanced mainly by private funds. The health 
system has three subsectors: the public subsector 
(SUS), in which services are ﬁ nanced and provided by 
the state at the federal, state, and municipal levels, 
including military health services; the private (for-proﬁ t 
and non-proﬁ t) subsector, in which services are ﬁ nanced 
in various ways with public or private funds; and the 
private health insurance subsector, with diﬀ erent forms 
of health plans, varying insurance premiums, and tax 
subsidies. The public and private components of the 
system are distinct but interconnected, and people can 
use services in all three subsectors, depending on ease 
of access or their ability to pay.

The public health-care subsystem
Implementation of the SUS began in 1990, the same 
year as the investiture of Fernando Collor de Mello, the 
ﬁ rst president elected by popular vote since the military 
dictatorship, who pursued a neoliberal agenda and 
would not commit to the health sector reform. 
Nonetheless, in 1990, a framework health-care law 
(Law 8080/90) was approved, specifying the attributions 
and organisation of the SUS. The health sector reform 
project was revived in 1992 after the President’s 
impeachment for corruption. Decentralisation was 
reinforced43 and the Family Health Programme (PSF) 
was launched. A new economic stabilisation plan (The 
Real 
Plan) 
was 
introduced 
in 
1994, 
outlining 
macroeconomic adjustment policies and projects for 
state reform.44 President Fernando Henrique Cardoso 
was elected to oﬃ  ce in 1994 (and was re-elected in 1998) 
and further encouraged macroeconomic adjustment 
and privatisation processes. President Luiz Inácio Lula 
da Silva (elected in 2002 and re-elected in 2006) 
maintained some aspects of his predecessor’s economic 
policy, but suspended privatisation and, in his second 
term, favoured a developmental agenda.
Although health sector reform became less of a political 
priority during the 1990s, various initiatives were 
undertaken, including development of a national 
HIV/AIDS prevention and control programme, increased 
tobacco control eﬀ orts, creation of the national sanitary 
surveillance agency, development of the National 
Supplementary Health Agency, and creation of a model 
of care for Indigenous health. The Mobile Emergency 
Care Service and the National Oral Health Policy (Brasil 
Sorridente), were initiatives, among many others, 
implemented after 2003, during the administration of 
President Lula (ﬁ gure 2).
Decentralisation and participatory management
Decentralisation of the health system was linked to a 
wider process of political transition and the redesign of 
the Brazilian Federation, which was started by democratic 
political movements in the 1980s and later shaped by 
macroeconomic adjustment programmes. This new 
federative agreement gave more independence to 
municipalities but also expanded federal resources and 
oversight. Health was the only sector that pursued such 
radical decentralisation, largely because of federal 
ﬁ nancial and regulatory actions.
Decentralisation of the health system was the 
underlying rationale for implementation of the SUS and 
involved complementary legislation, new rules, and 
administrative reform at all levels of government. 
Bylaws passed by the Ministry of Health—designed to 
redeﬁ ne resp on sib il ities—established funding mech-
anisms (including the Primary Care Quota, a per-person 
amount that the Ministry of Health transfers to 
municipalities to ﬁ nance primary health care), and set 
up new representative councils and management 
committees at each level of government. Since 2006, 
some of these laws have been replaced by a less 
hierarchical agreement (the Pact for Health) in which 
managers in each level of government sign commitments 
to health goals and responsibilities.45
To manage the decentralised policy, frameworks for 
government decision making were expanded, together 
with social participation and alliance-building between 
stakeholders.46 In addition to the national health 
conferences, an innovative structure was institutionalised 
by setting up health councils and intermanagerial 
committees at both the state (bipartite) and federal 
(tripartite) levels. Bipartite and tripartite decisions are 
reached by consensus (ﬁ gure 4).48–53
These political structures were groundbreaking 
innovations in Brazilian governance because they enabled 
a greater number and variety of stakeholders to take part 
in the decision-making process and deﬁ ned areas of 
institutional responsibility more clearly than before, 
guaranteeing that each level of government supports 
national health policy implementation.51,54–56 
The private health-care subsystem
Historically, state protection of the private sector in 
Brazil has fostered the privatisation of health care in 
medical practices and the creation of specialist 
diagnostic and therapeutic clinics, private hospitals, 
and private health insurance companies. The private 
health-care subsystem interfaces with the public sector 
by providing services contracted-out by the SUS, out-of-
pocket hospital and ambulatory services, drugs, and 
private health plans and insurance. Part of this supply 
is ﬁ nanced by the SUS and the rest is ﬁ nanced by 
private sources. The demand for private health plans 
and insurance is mostly from employees of public and 
private companies that oﬀ er private health plans and 
insurance coverage.
In 1998, 24·5% of Brazil’s population had health 
insurance—18·4% had private insurance and 6·1% had 
insurance for civil servants. This proportion grew slightly 
to 26% in 2008, and, in 2009, resulted in revenues of 
R$63 billion (about US$27 billion). Private dental plans 
have grown substantially.57 
The private health plan and insurance market is 
concentrated in the southeast region, where 61·5% of 
health companies are based and 65·5% of all contracts 
are held.58 Furthermore, of 1017 health-care companies, 
only a few dominate the market, with 8·2% of 
companies providing health plans and insurance 
policies to 80·3% of customers—many smaller 
companies are located on the edges of large cities and 
in small towns.
Most (77·5%) private plans and insurance policies (for 
both state-sector and private sector companies) are 
provided by commercial ﬁ rms. Some employers who 
oﬀ er health plans to their employees (self-insured 
employer health plans) make up the non-commercial

1787
segment of the market.59 Private health plans have been 
able to enrol a younger, healthier population2 and oﬀ er 
plans with diﬀ erent levels of choice and type of health-
care provider. Because demand is stratiﬁ ed by 
socioeconomic and occupational status, the quality of care 
and amenities available to employees of the same 
company can vary substantially, from executive-type plans 
that oﬀ er the best services34 to less-costly plans available to 
employees lower in the occupational hierarchy.
People with private health plans or insurance policies 
report having better access to preventive services and 
higher health-care use rates than do those without such 
plans or policies (table 3).2 However, people with private 
health plans and insurance policies often receive 
vaccines, high-cost services, and complex procedures 
such as haemodialysis and transplants through 
the SUS.60
The National Supplementary Health Agency was 
created in 2000 to provide legal and administrative 
regulation of the private health insurance market. 
Law 9656/98 made it illegal for insurance companies to 
deny coverage to patients with pre-existing disorders or 
to set limits on the use of speciﬁ c health-care services or 
procedures. The continuous expansion of the private 
subsector is subsidised by the state, while the public 
subsector is often underfunded, which potentially 
compromises its ability to guarantee quality of and access 
to care.61
Health system components
The SUS is tasked with undertaking health promotion, 
health surveillance, vector control, and health education, 
and with ensuring continuity of care to all Brazilians at 
the primary, specialist outpatient, and hospital levels.
Financing
The Brazilian health system is ﬁ nanced through taxes, 
social contributions (taxes for speciﬁ c social programmes), 
out-of-pocket spending, and employers’ health-care 
spending. Funding for the SUS comes from tax revenues 
and social contributions from the federal, state, and 
municipal budgets. Other sources of funding are 
private—ie, out-of-pocket and employer spending. 
Funding for the SUS has not been suﬃ  cient to ensure 
adequate or stable ﬁ nancial resources for the public 
system. Because social contributions have been larger 
than contributions from taxes, which are divided between 
federal, state, and municipal governments, the SUS has 
remained under-ﬁ nanced. In 2006, revenue from social 
contributions (17·7%) was greater than revenue from 
taxes (16·7%). At the federal level, social contributions are 
about 60% of overall revenue from levies and less than 
30% of tax revenue.62 Furthermore, the federal government 
receives 58% of tax revenues, whereas state governments 
receive 24·7% and municipalities receive 17·3%.62
Even proceeds from a social contribution introduced 
in 1997 speciﬁ cally for health funding (the Provisional 
Contribution on Financial Transactions) are channelled 
away from the health sector: in 2006, the health sector 
received only about 40% of the R$32 090 billion (US$ 
13 645 billion) raised by the Provisional Contribution on 
Financial Trans actions63— a substantial proportion of the 
remaining funds went towards paying interest and 
public debts.64 In 2007, this social contribution was 
repealed and the amount previously planned for health 
spending has not been replaced. Since 2007, reductions 
in the federal share of SUS ﬁ nancing have been only 
partly balanced by increased state and municipal health 
spending (ﬁ gure 5).
Federal spending on health care since 2003 increased 
in nominal terms, but adjustment for inﬂ ation shows a 
net decrease (table 1). So in 2007, only 8·4% of the gross

public share of health spending was 41%,8 which is low

purchases (table 4). Out-of-pocket spending as a 
proportion of total spending varies little between the 
poorest (5·83%) and wealthiest (8·31%) classes. 
However, diﬀ er ences exist in how each group spends 
these funds; the poorest spend most on medications, 
whereas the richest spend most on private health plans 
and insurance (ﬁ gure 6).
The SUS has thus done less to increase public funding 
for people’s health care needs than was envisaged when 
it was set up with the aim of establishing a universal 
and equitable health system in Brazil funded with 
public resources. National Household Survey (PNAD) 
data2 show that, in 1981, 68% of total health services 
provided in the month before the survey were paid for 
by public funds, 9% by private health plans or insurance 
policies, and 21% by out-of-pocket spending. By 2003, 
the proportion of health service consumption paid for 
by public funds fell to 56%, and remained at that level 
in 2008. However, contribution by health insurance 
companies has become much greater (21% of total 
spending in 2008), with the volume of services paid for 
by this sector increasing by 466% from 1981 to 1998. 
The proportion of spending from out-of-pocket 
payments 
has 
increased 
steadily 
from 
9% 
in 
1981 and 1998, 15% in 2003, and 19% in 2008. In 1981, 
the social security system paid for 75% of hospital 
admissions, whereas in 2008 the SUS paid for only 
67%. In 1981, 6% of hospital admissions were paid for 
by private health plans, a proportion that rose to 20% 
by 2008. The proportion of hospital admissions paid for 
out of pocket (about 10% in 2008) has remained constant 
since 1981.
Organisation and delivery of health services
Primary care
The development of primary health care, or basic care as 
it is called in the SUS, has been the subject of much 
attention in Brazil. Driven by the decentralisation process 
and supported by innovative programmes, the primary 
health care model aims to provide universal access and 
comprehensive health care, coordinate and expand 
coverage to more complex levels of care (eg, specialist 
care and hospital care), and implement intersectorial 
actions for health promotion and disease prevention. 
Several ﬁ nancial (eg, the Primary Care Quota) and 
organisational strategies have been used to meet this 
challenge, notably the Community Health Agents 
Programme and the PSF. The PSF and the Community 
Health Agents Programme were part of the government’s 
strategy for restructuring the primary health care and the 
SUS health-care models. Initially introduced as a vertical 
programme that oﬀ ered mainly maternal and child 
health services to more needy or at-risk populations, 
since 1998 the PSF has been the main strategy for 
structuring municipal health systems. An innovative 
feature of the PSF is its emphasis on the reorganisation 
of primary clinics to focus on families and communities 
and integrate medical care with health promotion and 
public health actions.
The PSF works through family health-care teams—
which are composed of one doctor, one nurse, one 
auxiliary nurse, and four to six community health 
workers—and, since 2004, the PSF has begun to include 
oral health teams, of which there were 17 807 in 2009.67 
Family health teams are located at PSF clinics, and are 
assigned to speciﬁ c geographical areas and deﬁ ned 
populations of 600–1000 families. The teams provide a 
ﬁ rst point of contact with the local health system, 
coordinate care, and work towards integration with 
diagnostic, specialist, and hospital care. Health services 
and health promotion activities take place at health 
facilities, in patients’ homes, and in the community. 
The PSF has expanded substantially; in 2010 there were 
roughly 236 000 community health workers and 
33 000 family health-care teams, reaching about 
98 million people in 85% (4 737) of municipalities 
in Brazil.
The trend towards the setting up and strengthening of 
regulatory structures in municipal health secretariats 
and family health clinics, although in its early stages, has 
been strongly inﬂ uenced by the expansion of the PSF. 
Municipalities have invested in decentralised and 
computerised regulatory systems, which has meant that 
some of them can monitor waiting lists for specialised 
care, increase service supply, introduce clinical guidelines, 
and use electronic medical records as strategies for 
integrating primary health care with the network of 
specialised services. The Ministry of Health has also 
introduced evidence-based clinical guidelines for the 
management of chronic disease.68
Investments in primary health car have brought 
about some positive results. In 2008, primary care was 
reported as the usual source of care for most Brazilians 
(57%, up from 42% in 1998), whereas the proportion of 
people who reported hospital outpatient departments 
as their usual source of care decreased from 21% to 
12% in the same period.2 Some users of the family

health-care clinics reported that referrals to secondary 
care services are more eﬀ ective when the referrals 
come from the family health-care teams, and that 
waiting times were shorter than with referrals from 
other sources.69 However, a substantial proportion still 
sought specialised services without a referral from 
primary care.69
Use of PSF services is also associated with improve-
ments in some health outcomes, such as lower post-
neonatal infant mortality rates (largely attributable to a 
reduction of deaths from diarrhoeal disease and lower 
respiratory tract infections).70–72 This eﬀ ect is more 
pronounced in municipalities that are capable of taking 
over outpatient service management from the federal or 
state govern ments.73 Health system beneﬁ ts include 
improvements in the reporting of vital statistics and 
reductions in potentially avoidable hospital admissions, 
which have decreased by almost 15% since 1999.74–76
Even though the number of temporary labour 
contracts has decreased, the primary care workforce 
still has high turnover, mainly because of diﬀ ering wage 
structures and employment contracts oﬀ ered by 
diﬀ erent municipalities.77 Expansion and consolidation 
of the PSF is further complicated by the presence of 
many traditional primary care facilities that were 
established before the PSF,78 which are often in the 
same geographical areas as PSF clinics. Generally, these 
two distinct models of care are not integrated and the 
population resorts to one service or the other, according 
to ease of access and convenience.78 In 2010, 15% of 
municipalities did not have PSF teams.67 There is also 
little investment into the linking of primary care with 
other levels of care; the supply of specialist and other 
care is further weakened by the poor integration of 
municipal-level and state-level providers, especially in 
the provision of diagnostic examinations. Municipal-
level manage ment capabilities are often poor, as is 
national regulation. Such drawbacks prevent the 
primary health-care model from fully meeting its 
objectives69 and draw attention to the continually 
evolving nature of strategies such as the PSF. To address 
concerns and improve service access and quality, the 
government launched the national primary care policy 
in 2006 and created family health support teams in

2008. These multiprofessional teams partner with the 
PSF to expand the coverage and scope of primary 
health-care actions and to support the development of 
regional referral networks.
Secondary care
Provision of secondary care by the SUS is problematic, 
because service supply is restricted and often given 
preferentially to individuals with private health plans.79 
Secondary care has little regulation and medium-
complexity procedures are often neglected in favour of 
high-cost ones.80 The SUS is highly dependent on 
contracts with the private sector, especially for diagnostic 
and therapeutic support services;69 only 24·1% of CT 
scanners and 13·4% of MRI scanners in Brazil are 
public, and access is patchy.81
However, policies to improve supply have led to an 
increase in specialist outpatient procedures in the SUS 
in the past 10 years.61 In 2010, such procedures accounted 
for about 30% of outpatient visits (table 5).
Furthermore, the Psychiatric Reform Law was passed in 
2001 to deinstitutionalise and reinforce the rights of 
individuals with mental illness, and led to the introduction 
of outpatient services, such as psychosocial care centres 
and 
psychosocial 
support 
and 
rehabilitation 
for 
those leaving psychiatric hospitals. The law has led to 
a 
reduction 
of 
20 000 
psychiatric 
hospital 
beds 
between 2001 and 2010.83 The number of community-based 
psychosocial care centres has more than tripled (from 424 
to 1541) and the number of therapeutic services has 
increased by ﬁ ve times (from 85 to 475) since the passing 
of the psychiatric law (ﬁ gure 2).84,85
The secondary care system has also seen the intro-
duction of specialised centres for dental care, 
counselling for HIV/AIDS and other sexually trans-
mitted diseases, and workers’ health and rehabilitation 
services. 24 h emergency care clinics were introduced 
in 2008 to relieve demand on hospital emergency 
departments. They coordinate with the emergency 
mobile care service, assisting people on the street, at 
home, and at work, with ambulances with basic or 
advanced support, helicopters, boats, and even motor-
cycles. By May, 2010, there were 391 emergency care 
clinics, and the emergency mobile care service was 
present in 1150 municipalities, covering 55% of Brazil’s 
population.84 In 2008, the SUS provided 74% of all 
emergency home care assistance.2
During the health sector reform, the trend has been 
to structure parallel subsystems in the SUS to respond 
to speciﬁ c needs, which leads to diﬃ  culties in 
coordination and continuity of care (panel 1). In 2007, 
the Ministry of Health set up a department that is 
responsible for the integration of primary care with 
emergency and specialised care services and health 
surveillance actions, to foster improved clinical 
management, health promotion, and rational use 
of resources.94
Tertiary and hospital care
Tertiary care includes some high-cost procedures, 
which are done predominantly by contracted private 
sector providers and public teaching hospitals, and are

paid for by the SUS at about market value.81 As in many 
health systems around the world, the Brazilian health 
system’s challenges include the control of costs, 
improvement of eﬃ  ciency, assurance of quality and 
safety, provision of access to comprehensive care, 
coordination with primary health care, and inclusion of 
doctors in problem solving.2,95,96 The system is not 
organised into a regionalised network of services 
nationwide, and systematic, eﬀ ective regulatory and 
referral mechanisms do not exist.97 Speciﬁ c policies for 
some high-cost care in the SUS do exist (eg, a system to 
manage waiting lists for organ transplants), and some 
specialties, such as cardiac surgery, oncology care, 
haemodialysis, and organ transplantion, are being 
organised into networks.
The Ministry of Health has attempted to organise 
networks by strengthening the PSF and implementing 
Integrated Health Care Territories.94 However, structural, 
procedural, and political obstacles, such as power 
diﬀ erentials between network members, low levels of 
accountability, 
administrative 
discontinuities, 
and 
politically-motivated 
managerial 
turn-over, 
could 
compromise the eﬀ ectiveness of such initiatives.22,97–99 In 
the private sector, the managed care model was adopted 
by only a few private health plan companies, along with a 
care model centred on individual demand rather than on 
population-based health promotion strategies.
The likelihood of a patient being admitted to hospital 
increases with the availability of beds and primary care 
clinics and decreases with the distance between the 
municipality in which the patient lives and the 
municipality in which care can be provided.100 This 
situation is cause for concern, because one in ﬁ ve 
hospital admissions in the SUS are to hospitals outside 
of the patient’s home municipality. Accordingly, 
residents of poor municipalities are less likely to be 
admitted to hospital than are residents of wealthier 
ones, which calls for policies to not only regionalise 
capacity and guarantee the transportation of patients to 
hospital, but to also change models of care to reduce 
such inequalities in access to hospitals. Regulation of 
the SUS has been inﬂ uenced by various interest groups, 
from the private sector to advocacy groups associated 
with the sanitary reform movement.101 Unfortunately, 
existing regulatory mechanisms are not yet suﬃ  ciently 
robust to allow major changes to the historical patterns 
of hospital medical care.
Infrastructure (supply)
Primary care clinics and emergency units are mainly 
public, whereas hospitals, outpatient clinics, and dia-
gnostic and therapeutic services are mainly private. 
In 2010, only 6·4% of diagnostic and therapeutic services 
were public. Between 1968 and 2010, 39 518 primary care 
clinics (health posts and health centres) were set up. In 
the past 10 years the model of care has changed, with 
increases in specialist outpatient services (29 374 clinics 
in 2010) and diagnostic and therapeutic support services 
(16 226 in 2010; table 5). Between 1990 and 2010, the 
number of hospitals—especially private hospitals—has 
decreased (ﬁ gure 7).

• 
The Ministry of Health provides ﬁ nancial incentives to 
higher education institutions to make curricular changes

• 
The drug market in Brazil is dynamic. By 2013, the drugs 
market in Brazil is expected to be the 8th largest in the 
world. Between 1997 and 2009, revenue from drug sales 
grew at 11·4% per year (in current value), totalling 
R$30·2 billion (US$17·6 billion), 15% of which was from 
the sale of generic drugs.
• 
The National Listing of Essential Medicine ensures access 
to and rational use of drugs, resulting in increased public 
spending, improved access to drugs, and a successful 
generic drugs policy,112 although universal access to 
pharmaceuticals has not been achieved.113
• 
The Ministry of Health has promoted the production of 
generic drugs and seeks to reduce the importation of 
other drugs by strengthening Brazilian drug companies to 
produce 20 products essential to the SUS within Brazil by 
2013. The antiretroviral zidovudine has been produced in 
Brazil since 1994 and laboratories have produced 
efavirenz since 2007.
• The outlook for vaccines is promising. Brazil has 
exported yellow fever and meningitis vaccines. In 2007, 
83% of vaccinations in Brazil used vaccines that were 
produced nationally.

In 2014, Hemobras (a blood product manufacturer) will 
produce albumin and other essential blood products at 
costs lower than the price of imported products.

Brazil has 6384 hospitals, 69·1% of which are private. 
Only 35·4% of hospital beds are in the public 
sector—38·7% of beds in the private sector are available 
to the SUS through contracts.21 A quarter of public 
hospitals are controlled by municipal governments. After 
decentralisation, many new hospitals were set up, 
averaging 35 beds each. As a result, about 60% of 
hospitals have 50 or fewer beds.1 These new, small 
hospitals—mainly municipal and for-proﬁ t hospitals—
tend to be less eﬀ ective and less eﬃ  cient than larger, 
hospitals.104 At the other extreme, in 2005, there were 
67 hospitals with more than 400 beds, mostly in the 
wealthiest (southeast) region of Brazil. The north region 
has no hospitals with more than 400 beds, but contains 
9·5% of smaller hospitals.105
Supply of hospital beds ﬁ nanced by the public sector is 
not suﬃ  cient. In 1993, Brazil had an inpatient bed 
density of 3·3 beds per 1000 population, this number 
has decreased to 1·9 beds per 1000 population in 2009, 
which is lower than that of all countries in the 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Develop-
ment, apart from Mexico (1·7 per 1000 population 
in 2007).65 The number of health professionals has, 
however, increased substantially in the past 10 years. 
In 2007, there were 1·7 doctors per 1000 population, 
although geographical distribution was uneven.3 There 
were also 0·9 nurses and 1·2 dentists per 1000 population, 
with a distribution much the same as that of doctors. 
Private universities have played an important role in the 
increase in number of health professionals by oﬀ ering 
many undergraduate places in health profession courses, 
especially in nursing courses. Between 1999 and 2004, 
the number of nursing graduates increased by 260% 
(table 5; panel 2).109
In 2005 the public sector provided 56·4% of 
employment in Brazilian health care, mostly at the 
municipal level (38·8%). Doctors accounted for 61% of 
the jobs, nurses accounted for 13%, and public health 
specialists accounted for only 0·2%.9
In the 1970s and 1980s some of Brazil’s most important 
health information systems were set up, including the 
SUS Hospital Information System. The Mortality 
Information System was introduced in 1975, and, in 1990, 
the Live Births Information System was launched to 
provide standardised data collection procedures at all 
hospitals—by 2002 it included data for 86% of all 
livebirths.110 More eﬀ ective policies are needed to improve 
the coverage and quality of health information systems 
and administrative data, which, at present, vary sub-
stantially across health information systems.111
Brazil has some prestigious research institutes, such 
as the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ) and several 
world-class public universities. Research and technology 
are supported by the Ministry of Health’s Science and 
Technology Department and the National Scientiﬁ c and 
Technological Development Council, which fosters 
health research and the incorporation of new technologies 
by the SUS and the health industry with a view to 
strengthening Brazil’s pharmaceutical and equipment 
industry (panel 3).
Access to and use of health care
Access to health care in Brazil improved substantially 
after the creation of the SUS. In a PNAD survey done 
in 1981, before creation of the SUS, 8% (9·2 million 
people) of the population reported use of a health 
service in the previous 30 days, whereas, in 2008, 14·2% 
(26 866 869 people) of the population reported such use 
in the previous 15 days, representing a 174% increase in 
health-care service use.2 The number of people seeking 
primary health care in clinics increased by about 450% 
between 1981 and 2008 (ﬁ gure 8). This increase was 
mainly attributable to a substantial increase in the size 
of the health workforce and the number of primary care 
clinics. In 1998, 55% of the population consulted a

doctor and that ﬁ gure rose to 68% in 2008. However, 
this number is low compared with such proportions in 
more developed countries, which range from 68% in 
the USA to more than 80% in countries such as 
Germany, France, and Canada.112 In 2008, 76% of 
individuals in the highest income group reported 
visiting a doctor, compared with 59% of individuals in 
the 
lowest 
income 
group, 
which 
shows 
that 
socioeconomic inequity exists.2 Such inequity does not 
exist among people who self-rate their health as poor,114 
indicating that people with serious health disorders are 
able to seek health care and receive treatment, 
irrespective of their socioeconomic class.
In 2008, 93% of people seeking health care received 
treatment, suggesting that health care is available to most 
when needed, and that the recorded social inequities may 
in fact be because of diﬀ erences in health-seeking 
behaviour. Perhaps people in lower income groups delay 
the decision to seek health care because of negative 
experiences in getting the care they needed or with the 
care they received, or because of other factors such as 
inability to miss work.115
Educational inequities in health care service use are 
steadily decreasing (ﬁ gure 9). Although health service 
use varies widely between people who have private health 
insurance and those who do not, the diﬀ erence between 
these two groups of people is also decreasing—in 1998, 
people with private health plans were 200% more likely 
to use a health service when in need than were people 
without such plans, but only 70% more likely in 2008.2
In 1981, only 17% of Brazil’s population had consulted a 
dentist, and little had changed by 1998, when nearly 
30 million people (19% of the population) declared that 
they had never been to a dentist.2 In 2000, ﬁ nancing for 
oral health workers for the PSF began and, by 2008, 40% 
of the population reported having visited a dentist in the 
previous year—only 11·6% reported having never visited 
a dentist.2 However, major socioeconomic inequities 
exist; in 2008, 23·4% of people in the lowest income 
group, compared with only 3·6% of those in the highest 
income group, had never consulted a dentist.2 
Socioeconomic disparities exist between individuals 
covered by private health insurance plans and those 
covered by the PSF (ﬁ gure 10), which indicates that rich 
and poor populations receive diﬀ erent standards of care 
in the Brazilian health system.
Set up in 1973, the National Immunisation Programme 
stands out as one of Brazil’s most successful public 
health programmes, as shown by its high vaccination 
coverage and sustainability—vaccines are supplied by the 
National Self-Suﬃ  ciency Programme in Immuno-
biologicals, which guarantees free access and high 
coverage. There have been no cases of poliomyelitis in 
Brazil since 1989, nor measles since 2000 (table 3).116
Despite an increase in population size and substantial 
population ageing, hospital admission rates for most 
disorders (about seven admissions for all disorders per 
100 population) did not change between 1981 and 2008.3 
The number of admissions ﬁ nanced by the public sector 
decreased during the same period. In 1982, the social 
security system ﬁ nanced 13·1 million admissions per 
year—a number that decreased to 11·1 million (ﬁ nanced 
by the SUS) in 2009. Admission rates are consistently 
higher for people with private health insurance (about 
eight admissions per 100 population) than they are for 
those without (table 1). The Ministry of Health has 
restricted hospital spending by each state, limiting 
hospitalisation payment according to population size, 
which could partly explain reduced access to hospital care 
and could have resulted in the underuse of hospital care 
by individuals who depend on publicly funded services.114
Despite growing awareness of the importance of 
quality of care in Brazil, much progress is still needed to 
ensure consistently high standards of care. The Ministry 
of Health and the national sanitary surveillance agency 
promote WHO initiatives to ensure the safety of patients, 
but adherence by services is low. For example, 
preventable adverse events in hospitals are very high 
(67% of all adverse events were thought to be 
preventable).94,115 The high frequency of adverse drug 
events is also a cause for concern,117 as is the frequency 
of nosocomial infections.118 Only a small proportion of 
health services have received accreditation. Highly 
skilled health professionals and high-quality health 
services do exist, but coherent ministerial policies for 
quality improvement and enforcement are lacking. As a 
result, a few states (eg, São Paulo, Minas Gerais6) and 
municipal health secretariats have developed their own 
approaches to improve quality.

Policy119 and the Code of Medical Ethics reinforce patients’

improvements (such as new policies) are needed to 
guarantee better quality care, the safety of patients, and 
patients’ rights in Brazilian health services.
Conclusions
The 1988 Brazilian constitution recognised health as a 
citizen’s right and a duty of the state, and established 
the basis for the creation of the SUS, which was based 
on the principles of universality, integrality, and social 
participation. Such constitutional recognition of health 
care was made possible after lengthy political struggles 
and the actions of the Brazilian Health Reform 
Movement. The implementation of a universal health 
system in Brazil began in an unfavourable political and 
economic climate, which promoted a neoliberal rather 
than a universal approach—a perspective that was 
reinforced by international organisations that argued 
against publicly ﬁ nanced national health systems or 
advocated for intermediate stages to achieving it.
During the past 20 years advances have been made in 
the implementation of the SUS. Institutional innovations 
were introduced, including a substantial decentralisation 
process that granted municipalities greater responsibility 
for health service management and means by which to 
enhance and formalise social participation in health 
policy making and accountability. In this report we have 
shown how the SUS has vastly increased access to health 
care for a substantial proportion of the Brazilian 
population, achieved universal coverage of vaccination 
and prenatal care, enhanced public awareness of health 
as a citizen’s right, and invested in the expansion of 
human resources and technology, including production 
of most of the country’s pharmaceutical needs.
However, the SUS is a health system under continual 
development that is still struggling to enable universal 
and equitable coverage. As the private sector’s market 
share increases, interaction between the public and 
private sectors are creating contradictions and unfair 
competition, leading to conﬂ icting ideologies and goals 
(universal access vs market segmentation), which has a 
negative eﬀ ect on the equity of health-care access and 
outcomes. Although federal funding has increased by 
about four times since the start of the past decade, the 
health sectors’ share in the federal budget has not grown, 
resulting in constraints on ﬁ nancing, infrastructure, and 
human resources.
Further challenges arise from the changing demo-
graphic and epidemiological characteristics of the 
Brazilian population, which necessitate transition from a 
model of acute care to one based on intersectorial health 
promotion and health service integration. The Pact For 
Health and its proposed health-care network based on 
primary care, coupled with recommendations from the 
National Commission on Social Determinants of Health 
to address the upstream causes of ill health might help 
shape more comprehensive models of care, although 
they will have to overcome formidable challenges.
Ultimately, to overcome the challenges that Brazil’s 
health system faces, a revised ﬁ nancial structure and a 
thorough reassessment of public-private relations will be 
needed. Therefore, the greatest challenge facing the SUS 
is political. Such issues as ﬁ nancing, composition of the 
public–private mix, and the persistent inequities cannot 
be solved in the technical sphere only. The legal and 
normative foundations have been laid and substantial 
operational lessons have been learned; the SUS must 
now be guaranteed its political, economic, and scientiﬁ c 
and technological sustainability.
