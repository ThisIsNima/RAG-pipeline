processing
Koji Sugioka1 and Ya Cheng2
The unique characteristics of ultrafast lasers, such as picosecond and femtosecond lasers, have opened up new avenues in materials
processing that employ ultrashort pulse widths and extremely high peak intensities. Thus, ultrafast lasers are currently used widely for
both fundamental research and practical applications. This review describes the characteristics of ultrafast laser processing and the
recent advancements and applications of both surface and volume processing. Surface processing includes micromachining, micro-
and nanostructuring, and nanoablation, while volume processing includes two-photon polymerization and three-dimensional (3D)
processing within transparent materials. Commercial and industrial applications of ultrafast laser processing are also introduced, and a
summary of the technology with future outlooks are also given.

INTRODUCTION
Materials processing using ultrafast lasers, lasers that emit light
pulses shorter than a few tens of picoseconds, was first reported
in 1987 by Srinivasan et al.1, Ku¨per and Stuke.2 They demon-
strated the clean ablation of polymethyl methacrylate almost
without the formation of a heat-affected zone (HAZ) using fem-
tosecond ultraviolet excimer lasers. The ablation threshold was
significantly lower than that for nanosecond laser ablation. These
experiments had a significant impact and the research in this field
was rapidly expanded in the 1990s. In addition, development of the
chirped-pulse amplification technique in Ti:sapphire regenerative
amplifiers,3 which emit energetic femtosecond pulses without
inducing damage or undesirable nonlinear effects in the amplifica-
tion medium, further accelerated fundamental research on ultrafast
laser processing. One important feature of ultrafast laser processing
is that it reduces heat diffusion to surrounding regions of the
processed area.4 This feature is well adapted to the high-quality
microfabrication of soft materials such as biological tissues5 and
hard or brittle materials such as semiconductors and insulators6
without HAZ formation. Furthermore, suppression of heat dif-
fusion to the surroundings improves the spatial resolution for
nanoscale processing.7 Another important aspect of ultrafast laser
processing is that nonlinear absorption (i.e., multiphoton absorp-
tion) can induce strong absorption even in materials that are trans-
parent to the ultrafast laser beam.8,9 Multiphoton absorption
permits not only surface processing,10 but also three-dimensional
(3D) internal microfabrication of transparent materials such as
glass and polymers.11–14 Davis et al.11 and Glezer et al.12 pioneered
this field and demonstrated respectively optical waveguide writing
and formation of nanovoid arrays inside glass in 1996. Currently,
internal microfabrication is widely applied to the fabrication of
photonic devices and biochips.15,16 It was also reported in 2001
that multiphoton absorption improves spatial resolution to exceed
the diffraction limit, due to the nonlinearity combined with the
threshold effect.17 Careful control of the laser power and scanning
speed enabled a minimum fabrication resolution of ca 18 nm to be
achieved.18 One of the major application fields of this feature is
two-photon polymerization (TPP) for the fabrication of photonic
crystals,19 micromachines20 and biochips.21 In the 2000s, it was
determined that ultrafast laser irradiation at intensities near the
ablation threshold forms nanoripple structures on various materi-
als with periodicities much shorter than the wavelength.22–25
Regular arrays of conical microstructures were also produced on
Si by irradiation with an ultrafast laser beam in a halogen atmo-
sphere (e.g., SF6 or Cl2).26,27 The surface structures produced
exhibit unique properties of anti-reflectivity, superhydrophobicity
and infrared absorption.
A robust, stable and very compact fiber chirped pulse amplifier was
also developed in the 2000s,28 which facilitated the application of this
research. More recently, a rare earth-doped laser medium was adopted
to realize a compact and high-power ultrafast laser system by diode
pumping, although the pulses were much broader than pulses gener-
ated by Ti:sapphire systems.29,30 Picosecond lasers based on this sys-
tem that are suitable for industrial applications have become

commercially available. In the 2010s, ultrafast laser processing is thus
becoming a more reliable tool for practical and industrial applications.
Here we provide a comprehensive review of ultrafast laser proces-
sing including surface micromachining, micro- and nanostructuring,
nanoablation, and 3D and volume processing after discussion of the
ultrafast laser processing characteristics. We then introduce commer-
cial applications of ultrafast laser processing before a final summary
and outlook are given.
CHARACTERISTICS OF ULTRAFAST LASER PROCESSING
Elimination of thermal diffusion and suppression of the HAZ
Materials processing with ultrafast lasers provides unique advantages
over conventional laser processing techniques that typically employ
nanosecond and longer pulses. Shortening of the pulse duration to a
time scale shorter than a couple of picoseconds fundamentally changes
the physics behind the interaction of laser with the solid, which results
in rapid and precise energy deposition into the materials. During
ultrafast laser irradiation, the excitation of carriers first occurs within
hundreds of femtosecond by the absorption of photons. At this stage,
the lattice remains largely undisturbed. Efficient energy transfer from
the electrons to the lattice occurs by electron-lattice scattering after the
end of the laser pulse.31,32 The thermalization between free electrons
and the lattice then typically occurs on the time scale of 1–100 ps,
depending on the electron–phonon coupling strength of the material.
Thermal diffusion to the surrounding area of the laser-irradiated
region can thus be eliminated as heat transfer by bulk thermal con-
duction occurs on a time scale longer than the electron–phonon coup-
ling time.
The suppression of thermal diffusion has important implications
for the laser processing of materials. Materials processing with lasers
results in phase and structural modifications induced by the inter-
action of light with a material. In an ideal case based on photolysis,
the spatial resolution is simply determined by carrier excitation within
the focal spot. However, when pulses with durations of nanosecond
and longer are used, such ideal resolution cannot be achieved due to
thermal diffusion. In addition, thermal effects such as melting and
resolidification can also remove subtle phase and/or structural
changes induced by various types of photophysical and photochemical
processes. These difficulties inherent to conventional laser processing
can be overcome with ultrafast laser materials processing.
Deterministic optical breakdown and reproducible nanoscale
resolution
When processing transparent materials such as glass and wide-band-
gap crystals with ultrafast laser pulses, the excitation of electrons from
the valence band to the conduction band is initiated through non-
linear processes such as multiphoton or tunnel ionization.33,34 The
electrons can then seed the subsequent electron heating or avalanche
ionization, which leads to the efficient absorption of light. Although
this is also possible to achieve with nanosecond lasers, in this case, the
initial (seed) electrons are mainly generated by the contribution of
defects and impurities, which causes the statistical character of laser-
induced optical breakdown. Employing ultrafast lasers in materials
processing can thus significantly reduce the fluctuation associated
with the optical breakdown threshold and lead to improved repro-
ducibility and control over the processing parameters.35
The synergetic contribution of the deterministic optical breakdown
characteristics and the suppression of thermal diffusion provide a unique
chance to realize deterministic nanoscale (subdiffraction-limited) fab-
rication with ultrafast lasers when there is an intensity threshold only
above which a photoreaction occurs upon absorption.17,36 Ideally, the
focal spot of the ultrafast laser beam will have a Gaussian-like spatial
profile. Thus, the modified zone area can be limited to only the central
area of the focal spot by adjusting the laser intensity to match the
threshold intensity, as shown in Figure 1a. If the laser intensity is
adjusted to match the straight solid line shown in Figure 1b with the
threshold intensity for a reaction, then the resolution for fabrication can
be reduced to two-fifths of the original beam width. Thermal diffusion
in ultrafast laser microprocessing is negligible; therefore, the combina-
tion of high-numerical aperture focusing and the threshold effect has
enabled deep subwavelength fabrication resolutions that are far beyond
the diffraction limit.17,18,36,37 In principle, there is no limit to the fab-
rication resolution when taking advantage of the threshold effect,
because the resolution can always be improved if one keeps on reducing
the difference between the chosen laser intensity and the threshold
intensity. However, in practice, due to the fluctuation of the output
power of the femtosecond laser, the fabrication process will become
extremely unstable when the laser intensity is near the threshold inten-
sity. Thus, a compromise has to be made between improving the reso-
lution and maintaining the stability of the fabrication process.
Internal modification and miscellaneous structural changes
One of the most exciting features of ultrafast laser processing is the
unique 3D capability to process within transparent materials in a space
selective manner. This is enabled by the nonlinear nature of the ultra-
fast laser interaction with the transparent material, which confines the
modification to only that within the focal volume. Combining a tight
focus scheme (which is necessary to avoid self-focusing and to ensure
high axial resolution) and direct writing, this approach has allowed for
a wide variety of phase and structural changes inside materials, such as
refractive index modification,11 the formation of nanovoids and peri-
odic nanogratings,38,39 element redistribution,40 nanocrystallization41
and nonreciprocal writing.42 Thus, the ultrafast (particularly femto-
second) laser pulses can be used to finely tune or even completely alter
the physical and chemical properties of transparent materials, which
provides the possibility to induce and integrate multiple functions in a
single substrate.16,43,44
SURFACE PROCESSING
Micromachining, drilling and cutting
Ultrafast lasers suppress thermal diffusion and thus reduce HAZ
formation, even in high thermal conductivity materials such as metals.
Figure 2a and 2b show scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of
holes drilled in 100 mm thick steel foils by ablation using laser pulses
with widths of 200 fs and 3.3 ns, respectively.45 The femtosecond laser
produces an ablated hole with a sharp edge and a steep wall with little
formation of HAZ. In contrast, nanosecond laser ablation produces
significant swelling around the ablated hole due to melting.
Ultrafast lasers can perform high quality micromachining of even
brittle materials such as glass. Figure 3a and 3b show SEM images of a
micromachined surface and glass cut by femtosecond laser ablation,
respectively. Both images reveal that clean ablation with sharp edges
was achieved without the formation of cracks. The ultrafast lasers have
already been used or are being considered for use in practical applica-
tions such as substrate scribing, hole drilling, surface patterning and
stent fabrication, as introduced later.
Micro- and nanostructuring
A variety of micro- and nanoscale structures are dependent on proces-
sing parameters such as the beam intensity, spatial and temporal beam

profiles, wavelength, polarization, and the processing environment
(ambient gas or liquid) that can be formed on the material surface.
The most well-known textured structure is nanoripples, which are
formed by ultrafast laser irradiation with a fluence near the ablation
threshold. Periodic grating structures, the so-called laser-induced peri-
odic surface structures, are formed by irradiating materials with line-
arly polarized nanosecond or longer laser pulses.46 Such structures are
understood to be formed by the interference of the incident laser light
with the reflected (scattered) light. Consequently, ripples are generally
oriented perpendicular to the incident polarization. The spacing of the
fabricated structure is given by l/n(16sin h), where l is the laser wave-
length, h is the laser incident angle and n is the refractive index of the
material.47,48 Therefore, the spacing is always in the order of the wave-
length or greater. In contrast, periodic grating structures formed by
femtosecond laser irradiation have a spacing much smaller than the
laser wavelength (typically 1/10–1/5 of l).49 Nanoscale periodic struc-
tures can be formed not only on the surfaces of various materials
including metals,50 ceramics,25,51 semiconductors52 and insulators,22,53
but also inside transparent materials such as glass.22,39 Figure 4 shows
SEM images of nanoripples formed on Si by irradiation with linearly
polarized 170 fs laser pulses with a wavelength of 800 nm and an energy
per pulse of 3 nJ.54 The orientation of the nanoripples formed is
perpendicular to the polarization of the incident laser beam. The peri-
odicity of the ripples is approximately L<120610 nm, which is
smaller than one-sixth of the incident laser wavelength. Various
mechanisms, including the self-organization of surface instability,22
second-harmonic generation,52 refractive index change,55 nanoplasma
formation56 and the excitation of surface plasmon polaritons,57 have
been proposed for the formation of nanoripples; however, no con-
sensus has been reached until now. Surface nanoripples produced by
femtosecond laser irradiation can be applied to reduce the friction
between moving components, reduce the adhesive force of micro-
and nanocomponents and increase the adhesion of thin films and
medical implants.
Another interesting and useful texture formed by ultrafast laser
irradiation is regular arrays of conical microstructures, which can be
produced on Si by irradiation with hundreds of femtosecond laser
pulses in a halogen atmosphere (e.g., SF6 or Cl2), as shown in
Figure 5.27,58 The structures produced can strongly reduce incident
light reflection, which is why it is named black silicon, and have sig-
nificantly increased absorption even in the infrared region.26,59 This
technique is effective to enhance the efficiency of photovoltaic solar

cells.60 Coating of such structured surfaces with a layer of silane mole-
cules produces superhydrophobic surfaces due to the lotus effect, and
these surfaces can be used to produce self-cleaning products.60,61
Similar surface structures can also be formed with other materials.62
Nanoablation
The ability of ultrafast laser processing to reduce the formation of
HAZ and thereby suppress heat diffusion means that nanoablation
can be performed with subwavelength resolution or less in combina-
tion with a well-defined processing threshold. In addition, the use of
nonlinear multiphoton absorption can further enhance the spatial
resolution compared with single-photon absorption at the same wave-
length when irradiated with a Gaussian beam, because the effective
absorption coefficient for n-photon absorption is proportional to the
nth power of the laser intensity.17 Furthermore, the fabrication reso-
lution can be further improved by adjusting the laser intensity to near
the ablation threshold, by which only the center part of the Gaussian
laser beam can exceed the ablation threshold. A combination of these
effects has enabled the formation of nanohole arrays with diameters
smaller than 200 nm on a GaN surface by femtosecond laser ablation
(l5387 nm and the numerical aperture of the objective lens50.9).63,64
In principle, the fabrication resolution can be improved as much as
desired with no limitation by employing the threshold effect with
precise control of the laser intensity. For example, short polymer lines
with linewidths as narrow as ca 18 nm have been produced using TPP
with a femtosecond laser.18 However, due to the fluctuation of the
femtosecond laser output power, the fabrication process becomes
extremely unstable when the laser intensity is near the threshold
intensity. Therefore, it is difficult to reproducibly realize superhigh
resolution over a long range. This problem can be overcome by
combining the threshold effect and the formation of a periodic nano-
grating. A nanoscale periodic grating is formed inside glass when
irradiated with a linearly polarized beam,39 which means that the
energy deposition inside glass is spatially modulated with nanoscale
periodicity at the focal spot, as shown in Figure 6a. When the femto-
second laser intensity is intentionally reduced to a level at which only
the intensity in the blue region of Figure 6a exceeds the threshold
intensity, only a single cycle of the modulated energy distribution in
the central area of the focal volume can be selected. It is noteworthy
that in such a case, the peak laser intensity at the center of the focal spot
is still much greater than the laser intensity at the edge of the blue zone
(i.e., the threshold intensity); therefore, the fabrication process will be
much less sensitive to the fluctuation of the laser output power than
that achievable by employing only the threshold effect to achieve the
same transverse resolution. Using this scheme, Figure 6b shows a
nanochannel with a width of ca 40 nm and a length of ca 40 mm (aspect
ratio: ca 1000) resulting from the ablation of porous glass in water
using a linearly polarized femtosecond laser beam.37
Another approach to nanofabrication is the development of novel
irradiation methods that can also overcome the diffraction limit of the
focused laser beam by using optical near fields. Combining a femto-
second laser beam with nanotips in scanning-probe microscopes such
as scanning near-field optical microscopes, scanning tunneling micro-
scopes and atomic force microscopes permits patterning with nanos-
cale resolution.65,66 Recently, nanoablation using metal and dielectric
nanospheres has been extensively investigated.67,68 The mechanism
for the formation of subwavelength structures involves ablation by
the near-field enhanced near the nanospheres. This method can be
used to fabricate nanoholes on various material surfaces including
semiconductors, metals and dielectrics.

3D AND VOLUME PROCESSING
Two-photon polymerization
Polymers are a cost-effective material for rapid prototyping. The domi-
nant approach to high-resolution 3D fabrication with polymer mate-
rials is TPP, of which the concept is schematically illustrated in
Figure 7. The TPP technique is based on the two-photon absorption
of femtosecond laser pulses in a photosensitive resin, which only
occurs in the central region of the focal spot where the laser intensity
exceeds the TPP threshold.69,70 Writing of predesigned 3D micro-
structures is realized by converting the liquid resin to the solid phase,
point by point, using a focused femtosecond laser beam. TPP is now
one of the major approaches to laser-based 3D printing with nano-
meter scale feature sizes. The basic concept, characteristics, range of
materials and potential applications have already been reviewed.21,71 In
the following, we will focus on recent advances such as improvement of
the resolution, functionalization of materials and the development of
novel applications.
One prominent feature of the TPP technique is the high fabrication
resolution achieved by use of the threshold effect. Currently, TPP
can reliably support a lateral resolution at the 100 nm level by the
optimization of laser conditions such as the laser wavelength, pulse
duration, peak intensity and repetition rate, and by exposure condi-
tions such as numerical aperture of the objective lens and the scan
speed, and finally by selection of the chemical/physical properties of
the photopolymers. The axial resolution is usually significantly
poorer, typically by a factor of three, due to the longitudinal intensity
distribution within the focal spot.72,73 Although higher resolutions in
the order of a few tens of nanometers have been demonstrated with
TPP by setting the laser intensity very near the threshold intensity, the
reproducibility becomes poor because of the inherent sensitivity of the
fabrication process to the fluctuation of the femtosecond laser output
power under these conditions. Inspired by the concept of stimulated
emission depletion microscopy, Li et al. have recently overcome the
limitation in TPP by developing a novel superresolution lithography
scheme. The stimulated emission depletion microscopy was originally
developed for the far-field nano-imaging of live cells.74 In the so-called
resolution augmentation through the photo-induced deactivation
lithography scheme as illustrated in Figure 8a, one laser beam (the
activation beam) comprised of 800 nm and 200 fs pulses was employed
to induce photopolymerization in a negative-tone photoresist.75

Figure 8b shows that portions of the polymerized lines written by the
activation beam alone have a relatively large width. To reduce the
width of the lines, another laser beam (the deactivation beam) is
operated at the same wavelength, but in the continuous wave mode,
and is superimposed on the activation beam with a suitable lateral
offset to deactivate the photoinitiator. With the deactivation beam,
depletion of photopolymerization can be realized as a result of the
metastable intermediate energy states of the photoinitiators. Thus, the
portions of polymer lines written by both activation and deactivation
beams are much thinner than those obtained with only the activation
beam. Using this technique, a fabrication resolution of ca 40 nm,
which is ca l/20, has been obtained in the axial direction. It is expected
that with full optimization of the photoresist properties and optical
configurations, resolution of ,10 nm will be attainable based on this
approach.
The reliable nanoscale resolution and 3D fabrication capability of
the TPP technique has resulted in wide attention for diverse applica-
tions, including integrated photonics (e.g., microoptics, diffraction
elements, photonic crystals and metamaterials),76–81 micromecha-
nics,20 microelectronics,82 microfluidics83,84 and biomimetics.85 For
these applications, functionalization of a photoresin is frequently
required, which is mainly achieved by filling the resin with various
types of functional nanoparticles, such as luminescent quantum dots,
noble metal nanoparticles and magnetic nanoparticles. The nanopar-
ticles can be either synthesized prior to filling into the resin, or syn-
thesized in situ within the resin by exposure to the femtosecond laser.
Functionalization can even be achieved by filling the resin with bio-
materials. Recently, Sun et al.86 demonstrated the direct femtosecond
laser writing of tunable microlenses by inducing photo-crosslinking in
a protein (bovine serum albumin) facilitated by a photosensitizer
(methylene blue). Figure 9 shows that the protein microlens becomes
swollen when immersed in a buffer solution, and the degree of
deformation is dependent on the pH of the buffer. Thus, for a protein
lens with a diameter of 40 mm, the focal length can be continuously
tuned over a wide range from ca 400 mm at pH 7.0 to ca 600 mm at pH
13.0. Such unique protein-based microoptical devices are dynamically
tunable and biocompatible.
3D processing of transparent materials
The section on ‘Characteristics of ultrafast laser processing’ noted that
irradiation of focused ultrafast laser pulses to transparent materials
can lead to a variety of phase and structural changes in a spatially
selective manner. This opens up new avenues for the fabrication of a
variety of integrated microdevices for applications such as integrated
photonics, optofluidics, optomechanics, optoelectronics and biome-
dicines. The successful construction of integrated microdevices is
mainly achieved using two approaches: writing of optical waveguides
along 3D paths by locally altering the refractive index and the forma-
tion of hollow microfluidic structures by local enhancement of the
etch rate, which facilitates subsequent removal of the material in the
modified region by wet chemical etching. In most cases, the direct
writing scheme is adopted because it offers the maximum degree of
flexibility in terms of the length and geometry of the fabricated struc-
tures. There are several review articles already available on femto-
second laser 3D processing in glass for optofluidic and photonic
applications, and on the writing of passive and active waveguide
devices in optical crystals and ceramics.15,16,43,44,87,88 Therefore, here
we focus on the latest advances in 3D materials processing with fem-
tosecond laser pulses for novel optofluidic and integrated photonic
applications.
Optical waveguides are building blocks for various photonic devices
such as beam splitters and couplers,89 Bragg grating waveguides,90
Mach-Zender interferometers,91 waveguide lasers in either glass or
crystalline materials92–94 and nonlinear optical waveguide devices.95
Optical waveguides can be easily inscribed in transparent materials
such as glass, crystalline materials and polymers by inducing perma-
nent refractive index changes in the focal volumes of tightly focused
femtosecond laser pulses.44 The waveguides are typically written in
transparent materials using a transverse writing scheme, where the
sample is translated perpendicular to the beam propagation direction.
This unique capability enables waveguides of arbitrary lengths and 3D
geometries to be written, and is thus particularly suitable for both
photonic and optofluidic integration applications. In addition, the

cross-sectional shape of the waveguides written with femtosecond
lasers can be tailored with beam shaping techniques, which is also
difficult to realize with traditional lithographic technology.73,96–98
Currently, waveguides written in glass using femtosecond lasers have
typical propagation losses in the order of 0.5–1.0 dB cm21, which is
sufficiently low for most microchip devices.
Optical waveguides written using femtosecond lasers have been
widely used for construction of optofluidic systems, waveguide lasers
and astrophotonic devices.99 Recently, 3D waveguides written with
femtosecond lasers have found important applications in quantum
circuits to replace the bulk optics in complex quantum optical sys-
tems.100,101 Crespi et al.101 have constructed a multimode interfero-
meter with femtosecond laser written waveguides for photonic boson
sampling. To realize an arbitrary 535 mode transformation, the
optical network must consist of a large amount of discrete ele-
ments such as beamsplitters and phase shifters, as shown in
Figure 10a. In contrast, a waveguide-based interferometer entirely
written in glass with a femtosecond laser, a 3D schematic repre-
sentation of which is shown in Figure 10b, is able to provide the
same functionality as a large interferometer. Moreover, the on-chip
interferometer is more robust due to the inherently stable inte-
grated waveguide structures. It is expected that scaling up of such
systems will benefit quantum computation, quantum communica-
tion and high-precision measurement.
Femtosecond lasers can also be used to fabricate microfluidic struc-
tures in glass materials by spatially selective precision modification
inside

materials

nonlinear
optical
absorption.
Currently, there are two main strategies for this application. The first
strategy employs femtosecond laser modification inside glass or crystal
materials followed by wet chemical etching.102,103 The other strategy is
to perform femtosecond laser 3D drilling from the rear surface of the
glass in contact with distilled water, by which the water introduced
into the microchannel can help to remove the ablated debris.104,105
The former approach has advantages that include larger scale micro-
fluidic structures and improved smoothness on inner wall, whereas the
latter approach allows for the fabrication of 3D microchannels in an
almost limitless variety of materials with smaller channel diameters. In
particular, microfluidic channels with arbitrary lengths have recently
been produced in porous glass immersed in water using water-assisted
femtosecond laser drilling.106 This approach has also enabled the fab-

40 nm,37,107 as shown in Figure 6.
The unique ability of direct femtosecond laser writing to simulta-
neously alter the chemical and optical properties of bulk glass ma-
terials provides new avenues to fabricate a variety of integrated micro-
fluidic and optofluidic microsystems/devices such as microfluidic
lasers,108 nanoaquariums to observe and determine the functions of
living organisms,109,110 optofluidic sensors with various functions
including liquid concentration analysis,111,112 single-cell detection
and manipulation systems113–115 and devices for the rapid screening
of algae populations.116 The latest progress is aimed at realizing an
optofluidic sensor by coating the inner wall of a microfluidic channel
with a polymer, as illustrated in Figure 11a.112 Glass materials typically
have refractive indices higher than most fluids, so that light propagat-
ing along a microfluidic channel filled with liquid sample will experi-
ence significant loss. In contrast, such a scheme can provide good
sensitivity because of the long interaction length between the light
and the sample. This problem was addressed by Hanada et al.,112 where
the inner walls of prefabricated microchannels in glass were coated
with a polymer of which the refractive index was lower than water, as
shown in Figure 11b. This leads to the low-loss propagation of light in
microfluidic channels by total internal reflection at the liquid/polymer
surface. This improvement realized a sensitivity of 200 nM for glucose-
D as a sample analyte.112

Femtosecond lasers have also been used to produce various types of
microoptical components in glass. Microoptical mirrors and lenses
can be fabricated using the air/glass interface created inside glass by
direct femtosecond laser writing and subsequent chemical etch-
ing.117,118 For such optical applications, the surface roughness on
the as-etched inner walls is still too high, which creates significant loss
and distortion of the wavefront. The surface roughness can be dra-
matically improved with an additional post-annealing process at a
temperature slightly lower than the melting point of glass, which
induces surface reflow for surface smoothening without causing
deformation to the fabricated structures.119 In addition, the fabrica-
tion of polarization-sensitive optics with femtosecond lasers is now
undergoing rapid growth. This fabrication is achieved by arranging the
distributions and orientations of nanogratings written in glass using
polarization controlled femtosecond laser pulses.39,56 This method has
enabled the production of devices such as diffraction gratings, polari-
zation and optical vortex converters.120,121
COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS
Ultrafast laser ablation was applied to the repair of chromium-on-
fused-silica photomasks for deep ultraviolet photolithography in the
field of semiconductor manufacturing at IBM’s mask-making facil-
ity.122 Pulses of 100 fs with a wavelength of 266 nm realized a spatial
resolution better than 100 nm.123 Concurrently, the first application of
ultrafast lasers to mass production processes was drilling inkjet nozzles
with specific shapes by picosecond laser ablation.122
Approximately 10 years ago, ultrafast laser processing showed poten-
tial to satisfy many requirements in the automotive industry, including
miniaturization, high precision, high quality, applicability to a diversity
of materials, variety of variants, smaller lots and cost-effectiveness. For
example, the structuring of small grooves into the surface of the cylinder
wall of a combustion engine by design ensured complete distribution of
lubricant along the piston wall and reduced the friction losses of the
engine. A more beneficial point of this structure is a reduction in the
amount of lubricant injected into the engine, which significantly
reduces particle emissions and extends the system lifetime. This tech-
nique has been implemented by various car manufacturers including
serial production and racing sports manufacturers.124 Since 2007, pico-
second laser trimming has been used to produce exhaust gas sensors,
as shown in Figure 12a, at the Robert Bosch plant in Bamberg,
Germany.125 These sensors have a special ceramic layer and can measure
the exhaust gas properties faster and more precisely than conventional
sensors. Such sensors enable emissions to be reduced by optimizing
combustion control. Furthermore, since 2009, picosecond lasers have
been used to fabricate diesel engine injectors, where drain grooves are
microstructured around a high-pressure passage using picosecond laser
pulses, as shown in Figure 12b.125 The structured drainage grooves
allow a tight system, even at pressures up to 2000 bar. As a result, diesel
injection systems have become more reliable, powerful and envir-
onmental friendly.
In 2011, black Si, which is produced by femtosecond laser irra-
diation in a halogen atmosphere (Figure 5), was applied to produce
commercial photovoltaic Si solar cells by SiOnyx Inc.126 Average effi-
ciencies as high as 16.9% were achieved for 150 mm thick multicrystal-
line Si that was 20% thinner than conventionally used wafers; a cost
reduction of 10%–15% was realized. Ultrafast lasers are also promising
tools for scribing and patterning in the manufacture of photovoltaic
solar cells based on copper indium gallium (di)selenide (CIGS) or

copper indium selenide.127 For patterning, it is necessary to isolate the
back contact (Mo) between cells (P1 process), selectively remove the
CIGS layer from the top of the back contact layer (P2 process) and
selectively remove the absorber and front contact (transparent con-
ductive oxide) layers (P3 process). Conventional nanosecond lasers
are widely used for P1 processes, whereas P2 and P3 processes are
typically processed using mechanical scribing tools. This is due to
the structure of CIGS photovoltaic solar cells. Specifically, when fab-
ricating CIGS photovoltaic solar cells, a metallic back contact is first
deposited on the glass substrate to form a broadband reflective layer at
the rear surface of the module. The absorber and front contact trans-
parent conductive oxide layers are then deposited on top, and these
layers must be processed from the front to prevent damage to the
metallic back contact. Picosecond laser processing can replace mecha-
nical scribing for the P2 and P3 processes because it does not cause
thermal damage to the underlying layers. However, its adoption is
currently limited because the process is immature and more expensive
than conventional nanosecond laser processing.
Meanwhile, ultrafast lasers perform scribing and cutting of glass
with not only high quality edge, but also flexible geometries. These
features have a widespread impact on numerous applications, includ-
ing ultrathin to hardened glass, which have led to a breakthrough for
ultrafast lasers in the mass production of displays for cell phones and
tablet computers.128 Ultrafast laser patterning is also expected to be
used for the manufacture of organic light emitting diode displays.
One practical application of ultrafast lasers in the medical field is the
fabrication of coronary stents, which are used for the minimally inva-
sive treatment of arteriosclerosis as an alternative to bypass operations.
Stents are typically fabricated from stainless steel or shape memory
alloys. However, it is necessary to post-process these materials chemi-
cally to realize the required properties. In addition, there have been
some medical problems with stents, such as the risk of restenosis and
limited biocompatibility. To achieve better biocompatibility, Mg-
based alloys or special biopolymers should be used. However, these
materials also suffer from problems in stent production, in that they
require a poorly established post-processing technique and they react
strongly to thermal loads. Ultrafast laser micromachining can over-
come these problems since it produces little debris as well as little HAZ.
Figure 13 shows a medical stent fabricated from a bioresorbable poly-
mer using femtosecond laser ablation without post-processing129 that
is currently ready for practical use.
Another application in the medical field is laser-assisted in situ
keratomileusis, commonly referred to as LASIK, which is a refractive
surgery used to correct myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism using a
laser.130 Figure 14 shows an optical microscope image of a cornea in
which femtosecond laser irradiation has created a flap and a lens body
by making cuts inside the cornea. A system equipped with a femto-
second laser to form corneal flaps (Femto-LASIK) is now commer-
cially available, and is more precise and predictable than a
conventional mechanical microkeratome.131
SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
Ultrafast laser processing has fundamentally changed the way of mate-
rials microprocessing with lasers. This approach provides unique
advantages such as the suppression of thermal diffusion, nonlinear
multiphoton excitation of carriers, deterministic optical breakdown
threshold, internal modification of transparent materials and repro-
ducible nanoscale resolution. It has become a ubiquitous microma-
chining tool for various materials including metals, semiconductors,
ceramics, glass, crystals, polymers and even soft materials such as
biotissues. When being applied for surface structuring, ultrafast laser
processing induces novel properties in terms of friction, adhesion,
optical absorption and/or reflection, and hydrophobicity. Scanning
of tightly focused ultrafast laser pulses in transparent materials enables
the formation of 3D micro-/nanostructures with limitless geometries
and configurations, which makes it possible to produce functional
components and devices for integrated optics and lab-on-a-chip
applications. Besides fundamental research, ultrafast lasers have also
been employed for several practical and industrial applications, such
as photomask repairs, ink nozzle drilling and medical stent fabrica-
tion. These lasers are now also used in the electronics industry for
scribing, patterning and texturing of glass and semiconductors (e.g.,
photovoltaic cells and light emitting diode displays).
The past efforts in this research field have mostly been in three
directions; uncovering new physical mechanisms, developing new fab-
rication techniques and improving performance, and extending the
application range. This general trend will continue in the future,
although the latter direction may be more emphasized. On the mecha-
nism investigation side, recent interest has been focused on femto-
second laser-induced non-ablative processes, such as nanograting
formation at critical optical intensity, and phase and structural
changes in high pressure nano-environments. Understanding these
physical processes requires the diagnosis of ultrafast plasma dynamics

inside transparent materials with micron or submicron spatial reso-
lution and few- or subfemtosecond temporal resolution. On the tech-
nical development side, significant progress has been achieved in the
development of novel ultrafast laser systems. The replacement of
Ti:sapphire crystals with fibers or thin disks has not only led to high
average powers (i.e., intense ultrafast laser pulses at high repetition
rates) that will allow direct laser writing at speeds leveling the order of
tens of meters per second, but will also make the ultrafast laser systems
more robust and cost-effective.132,133 The rich variety of parameters
provided by ultrafast laser pulses has allowed femtosecond laser beam
shaping to be extensively investigated. Early efforts were mainly
focused on spatial or temporal shaping of ultrafast laser pulses,
whereas recent interest has shifted to simultaneous spatiotemporal
manipulation of the femtosecond laser pulses, which has enabled
modification of the peak intensity distribution in the focal area,134
the elimination of self-focusing,135,136 high-efficiency 3D fabrica-
tion137 and induction of the nonreciprocal writing effect.138 In addi-
tion, manipulation of the femtosecond laser pulse polarization has
enabled the fabrication of polarization-sensitive optical devices and
nanofluidic channels in glass. Beam shaping effects have also been
exploited in TPP, aimed at either high-speed parallel processing or
subdiffraction-limited nanostructuring. Continuous improvement in
understanding the physical mechanisms and advances in the develop-
ment of fabrication techniques will help accelerate the widespread use
of ultrafast laser processing over a broad range of applications, includ-
ing integrated optics and photonics, optofluidics, optomechanics,
optoelectronics, surface micro- and nanostructuring, glass welding
and tissue engineering.139
