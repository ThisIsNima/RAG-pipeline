Macroautophagy
is
a
bulk
degradation
process
induced by starvation in eukaryotic cells. In yeast, 15
Apg proteins coordinate the formation of autophago-
somes. Several key reactions performed by these
proteins have been described, but a comprehensive
understanding of the overall network is still lacking.
Based on Apg protein localization, we have identi®ed
a novel structure that functions in autophagosome
formation. This pre-autophagosomal structure, con-
taining at least ®ve Apg proteins, i.e. Apg1p, Apg2p,
Apg5p, Aut7p/Apg8p and Apg16p, is localized in the
vicinity of the vacuole. Analysis of apg mutants
revealed that the formation of both a phosphatidyl-
ethanolamine-conjugated
Aut7p
and
an
Apg12p±
Apg5p conjugate is essential for the localization of
Aut7p to the pre-autophagosomal structure. Vps30p/
Apg6p and Apg14p, components of an autophagy-
speci®c phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex, Apg9p
and Apg16p are all required for the localization of
Apg5p and Aut7p to the structure. The Apg1p protein
kinase complex functions in the late stage of auto-
phagosome formation. Here, we present the classi®ca-
tion of Apg proteins into three groups that re¯ect each
step of autophagosome formation.

Introduction
During macroautophagy in yeast, a portion of the
cytoplasm is non-selectively sequestered into double-
membrane structures (autophagosomes) and delivered to
the vacuole for degradation. Electron microscopic analysis
revealed that autophagosomes fuse with the vacuolar
membrane to release the inner membrane structure into the
lumen (Baba et al., 1994). Autophagosomes are generated
when a cup-shaped membrane sac (isolation membrane)
extends to enwrap and seal cytoplasmic materials. This
elongation process, accompanied by the assembly of
membranous structures (Kirisako et al., 1999), is currently
not well characterized. In mammalian cells, autophago-
somes
are
generated
in
a
similar
manner.
In
rat
hepatocytes, osmiophilic membranes designated as phago-
phores were observed under an electron microscope
(Seglen, 1987; Fengsrud et al., 1995, 2000). In mouse
embryonic stem cells, similar isolation membranes were
identi®ed
by
electron
microscopy
as
precursors
of
autophagosomes (Mizushima et al., 2001). To understand
the molecular mechanism controlling autophagy, we
isolated 15 mutants defective in autophagy (apg) in yeast
(Tsukada and Ohsumi, 1993) with disorders of bulk
protein degradation, sporulation and the maintenance of
viability
under
starvation
conditions
(Klionsky
and
Ohsumi, 1999). A vacuolar hydrolase aminopeptidase I
(API) was constitutively transported to the vacuole via
small double-membrane vesicles (Scott et al., 1997). This
cytosol-to-vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway runs under
growing conditions. Extensive overlaps have been found
in genes involved in the APG, AUT (autophagy) and CVT
pathways (Harding et al., 1996). All apg mutants except
apg17 are known to be defective in the Cvt pathway.
Recent characterization of the Apg proteins has identi-
®ed two ubiquitin-like systems utilizing approximately
half of the Apg proteins. Apg12p, a ubiquitin-like protein,
is covalently attached to Apg5p to form an Apg12p±
Apg5p conjugate controlled by the serial action of Apg7p
and Apg10p (Mizushima et al., 1998). Apg7p, a member
of the E1-like activating enzymes, forms a thioester
linkage with Apg12p (Kim et al., 1999; Tanida et al.,
1999; Yuan et al., 1999). Apg12p subsequently forms a
thioester intermediate with Apg10p, an E2 conjugating
enzyme (Shintani et al., 1999). Apg12p is then linked to
Lys149 of Apg5p through an isopeptide bond with the
C-terminal glycine. Apg16p then interacts through its
C-terminal coiled-coil region to form homo-oligomers
following direct interaction with the Apg12p±Apg5p
conjugate (Mizushima et al., 1999). In mammalian cells,
a homologue of the Apg12p±Apg5p conjugate transiently
associates with the membranes of precursor autophago-
somes (Mizushima et al., 2001).
Aut7p/Apg8p, a second ubiquitin-like protein involved
in autophagy, is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine
(PE; Aut7p±PE) by the serial action of three Apg proteins,
Aut2p/Apg4p, Apg7p and Aut1p/Apg3p (Ichimura et al.,
2000; Kirisako et al., 2000). The C-terminal Arg117 of
Aut7p is removed through the action of Aut2p, a cysteine
protease (Kirisako et al., 2000), to expose Gly116. Follow-
ing activation by Apg7p (E1), the processed Aut7p is
transferred to Aut1p (E2). Aut7p is then covalently linked
to PE. Aut2p further cleaves Aut7p±PE, releasing Aut7p,
an essential step in the normal progression of autophagy
(Kirisako et al., 2000). Aut7p is the ®rst protein to localize
to autophagosomes and intermediate structures (Kirisako
et al., 1999; Huang et al., 2000); this characteristic of
Aut7p allows us to use Aut7p to monitor autophagosome
formation. LC3, the mammalian homologue of Aut7p, is
The pre-autophagosomal structure organized by
concerted functions of APG genes is essential for

also localized on the membranes of autophagosomal and
precursor membranes (Kabeya et al., 2000; Mizushima
et al., 2001).
Additional Apg proteins, not known to participate in
ubiquitin-like systems, are also required for autophagy.
Vps30p/Apg6p, in addition to a role in autophagy,
functions in vacuolar protein sorting (Kametaka et al.,
1998). Vps30p forms a speci®c phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3-kinase) complex required for autophagy,
consisting of Vps30p, Apg14p, Vps34p and Vps15p.
These data suggest that the dynamic membrane events
mediated by the PI3-kinase complex are necessary for
autophagy (Kihara et al., 2001a). A class of PI3-kinase and
beclin, a human homologue of Vps30p, are also essential
for autophagy in human cells (Liang et al., 1999; Petiot
et al., 2000). Beclin physically interacts with the PI3-
kinase complex on the trans-Golgi network (Kihara et al.,
2001b).
Tor kinase negatively regulates the induction of
autophagy; this kinase activity is inhibited by rapamycin
(Noda and Ohsumi, 1998). As the inactivation of Tor
activity induces autophagy, treatment with rapamycin
mimics the starvation response. The inactivation of Tor
activity causes a rapid dephospholylation of Apg13p
(Abeliovich et al., 2000; Kamada et al., 2000). Apg13p
and
Apg17p
associate
with
Apg1p
protein
kinase
(Matsuura et al., 1997) to form the Apg1p protein kinase
complex, an essential component of autophagy. Binding of
dephosphorylated Apg13p to this complex enhances the
kinase activity of Apg1p (Kamada et al., 2000).
The characteristics of each Apg protein are gradually
being uncovered; their functional interrelationship, how-
ever, is poorly understood. This is due to a lack of markers
allowing the identi®cation of intermediate steps occurring
before or during autophagosome formation. To obtain
further insights into the functional relationship between
the Apg proteins, we observed the behaviour of Apg
proteins fused to ¯uorescent proteins utilizing a sensitive
imaging system. We examined the dynamics of the Apg
proteins involved in the two ubiquitin-like systems, Apg5p
and Aut7p. Based on their modi®cation and localization in
apg mutants, we have de®ned a pre-autophagosomal
structure containing Apg1p, Apg2p, Apg5p, Aut7p and
Apg16p. This structure, involved in the production of
autophagosomes, provides a clue for investigating the
steps of autophagosome formation.
Results
A punctate structure on which Apg1p, Apg5p,
Aut7p and Apg16p are colocalized
Apg proteins are involved in several essential reactions in
autophagy, such as ubiquitin-like systems or phosphoryl-
ation reactions. The interrelationship between these reac-
tions in autophagosome formation, however, remains
unknown. It is critical to know the intracellular localiz-
ation. Several Apg proteins, e.g. Apg5p (George et al.,
2000), Aut7p/Apg8p (Kim et al., 2001) and Apg9p (Noda
et al., 2000), are localized to perivacuolar punctate
structures. To analyse the localization of Apg proteins to
these punctate structures, we visualized green ¯uorescent
protein (GFP)-fused Apg proteins using a sensitive
microscope system. GFP fusions were expressed from
centromeric plasmids under the control of natural pro-
moters. In Daut7 cells expressing physiological levels of a
GFP±Aut7p fusion protein (Figure 1A), GFP±Aut7p
complemented the defect of autophagy (Figure 1C±E).
These molecules were localized to punctate structures,
proximal to the vacuole (Figure 1H and I). Apg5p±GFP
retained the ability to conjugate with Apg12p (Figure 1B);
when introduced into de®cient cells, Apg5p±GFP restored
proper autophagic function (Figure 1C, F and G). The

additional chimeric proteins used in this study were also
functional in the autophagic process (data not shown).
Next, we fused cyan ¯uorescent protein (CFP) and
yellow ¯uorescent protein (YFP) to several different Apg
proteins and examined their colocalization. Fluorescent
Aut7p served as a marker of the punctate structures.
Apg1p, Apg5p and Apg16p colocalized with Aut7p on a
single punctate structure located close to the vacuole
(Figure 2). After the addition of rapamycin, CFP±Aut7p
was delivered to vacuoles in a time-dependent manner
(Figure 2A, D and G). YFP±Apg1p was delivered to
vacuoles after lengthy treatment with rapamycin (data not
shown), whereas Apg5p±YFP and Apg16p±YFP were
never transported to vacuoles (Figure 2B and H). Apg2p
colocalizes with Aut7p on a perivacuolar punctate struc-
ture (Shintani et al., 2001). Consequently, the punctate
structure is shown to contain Apg1p, Apg2p, Apg5p,
Aut7p and Apg16p. Apg12p is likely to be colocalized
with Apg5p and Apg16p as a component of the AApg12p±
Apg5p±Apg16p complex. As Apg13p and Apg17p interact
physically with Apg1p (Kamada et al., 2000), it is
probable that these molecules also reside on the punctate
structure. This is the ®rst report demonstrating the
colocalization of multiple Apg proteins.
Apg9p is a putative membrane protein and is not
cofractionated
with
typical
endomembrane
marker
proteins, autophagosomes or Cvt vesicles (Noda et al.,
2000). Apg9p±GFP exhibited an uneven, cytosolic distri-
bution in addition to its localization on several punctate
structures (Noda et al., 2000; Figure 3A and B). This
pattern was not altered in other apg mutants (Figure 3C
and D; data not shown). To examine the use of this protein
as a punctate structure marker, we compared the local-
ization of Apg9p±GFP and Aut7p by immuno¯uorescence
microscopy. The punctate structures labelled with Aut7p
seldom colocalized with those labelled by Apg9p±GFP
(Figure 3E±L), although the two structures were occa-
sionally in close proximity (arrows in Figure 3K). This
pattern of Apg9p indicates that it is not a suitable marker
for the punctate structure.

Electron microscopic analysis established that auto-
phagosomes accumulate in the Dypt7 mutant (Kirisako
et al., 1999). We therefore examined the localization of
Apg5p±YFP and CFP±Aut7p in Dypt7 cells. Following
rapamycin treatment of these cells, autophagosomes
labelled with CFP±Aut7p appeared as dim dots in the
cytosol (Figure 4A), whereas Apg5p±YFP was detected as
a punctate pattern (arrow in Figure 4B). Every punctate
structure labelled with Apg5p±YFP was associated with
CFP±Aut7p (arrow in Figure 4C). CFP±Aut7p staining of
the structure was of a greater intensity than the other
CFP±Aut7p dots (arrow in Figure 4A). These observations
suggest that this punctate structure containing several
colocalized Apg proteins is not an autophagosome.
To investigate the involvement of the endocytic path-
way in punctate structure formation, we examined the
class E compartment, an exaggerated prevacuolar com-
partment in class E vacuolar protein sorting (vps) mutants
(Raymond et al., 1992). The class E compartment is
labelled with FM4-64, a lipophilic stylyl dye, as an
intensely stained membrane-enclosed structure (Vida and
Emr, 1995) and morphologically similar to the punctate
structure labelled with Aut7p. We observed the localiza-
tion of GFP±Aut7p in a class E vps mutant, Dvps4
(Raymond et al., 1992). The GFP±Aut7p punctate struc-
ture did not colocalize with the class E compartment in this
mutant (Figure 5). These data suggest that the punctate
structure is not organized through the endocytic pathway.
Therefore, this punctate structure is a novel structure
localized proximal to the vacuole.
Genetic analysis of APG genes required for the
organization of the punctate structure
We have found a novel punctate structure in which at least
®ve Apg proteins are concentrated. We examined the
organization within this punctate structure by studying the
localization of Apg5p±GFP and GFP±Aut7p in apg
mutants (Figure 6; summarized in Table I). We also
assessed the quantities of PE-conjugated Aut7p (Ichimura
et al., 2000; Kirisako et al., 2000) in each apg mutant by
SDS±PAGE in the presence of 6 M urea (Figure 7). Based
on these observations, we grouped the apg mutants into
three categories. These classes corresponded well to
de®ned functional units, including the Apg1p protein
kinase complex, the two ubiquitin-like systems and
the PI3-kinase complex necessary for autophagy. This
classi®cation provides several new insights into the
interaction between these classes, detailed in the following
sections.
Analyses of class A apg mutants provide evidence
that the punctate structure is involved in
autophagosome formation
The class A mutants possess both Apg5p±GFP and
GFP±Aut7p localized to the punctate structure as in
wild-type cells (Table I). The class A genes consist of
APG1, APG2, APG13 and APG17. Apg13p and Apg17p
are regulatory factors of the Apg1p protein kinase. As the
class A mutants demonstrate normal punctate structures,
the Apg1p protein kinase complex is unlikely to be
involved in the formation of the punctate structure. The
class A mutants all possessed normal levels of Aut7p±PE
(Figure 7).
To examine whether the punctate structure is physio-
logically functional, we generated an apg1ts allele by
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mutagenesis. Auto-
phagic activities were measured by monitoring the alka-
line phosphatase (ALP) activity in cells expressing a
cytosolic proform of the ALP (Pho8D60p), which is
transported to vacuoles and becomes mature (Noda et al.,
1995). We estimated the temperature sensitivity of this
allele from the maturation of API (Figure 8A) and the ALP
assay (Figure 8B) using Dapg1 cells carrying the apg1ts
plasmid (apg1ts cells). At 23°C, the apg1ts cells contained
normal levels of mature API (Figure 8A) and possessed
signi®cant autophagic activity (Figure 8B). At 37°C,
however, both the maturation of API and autophagic
activity were completely blocked (Figure 8A and B).
Autophagy in the apg1ts cells at 30°C occurred at the same
levels as at 23°C. The activity of ALP increased linearly
with time for 6 h following incubation in nitrogen-free
medium at 23°C (Figure 8C). On transferring the cells to
37°C, autophagy was immediately blocked (Figure 8C).
When the cells were transferred from 37°C to 23°C, the
autophagic activity was recovered without a lag period
(Figure 8C). Apg1tsp was detectable by immunoblot even
after an overnight incubation at 37°C (Figure 8A), dem-
onstrating that apg1ts is a reversible temperature-sensitive
allele defective in autophagy.

On shifting the temperature from 37°C to 30°C, we
followed the dynamics of GFP±Aut7p in apg1ts cells. At
30°C, GFP±Aut7p was visualized in the punctate structure
and the vacuole after rapamycin treatment, as seen in wild-
type cells (Figure 9A). At 37°C, the staining intensity of
the punctate structure increased, accompanied by a lack of
vacuolar staining after rapamycin treatment (Figure 9B,
4 min). Next, we examined the progression of GFP±Aut7p
staining following temperature decrease in real time using
time-lapse microscopy. Within 10 min, several dots
labelled with GFP±Aut7p separated from the punctate
structure (Figure 9B). During 30 min of incubation at
30°C, ¯uorescence intensity of vacuoles became brighter
as these dots disappeared, suggesting that they are
autophagosomes. We concluded that the punctate structure
actually participates in the formation of autophagosomes.
We next treated apg1ts cells with cycloheximide for
20 min, following a 4 h incubation at 37°C in the presence
of rapamycin. On decreasing the temperature, similar dots
appeared, leading to ¯uorescent staining of the vacuole
(data not shown). This experiment demonstrates that the
emergence of autophagosomes from the punctate structure
depends on the activity of Apg1p; de novo protein
synthesis, however, is not necessary. As Apg1p is
localized to the punctate structure (Figure 2D±F), the
Apg1p protein kinase complex functions in autophago-
some formation at a later step than the organization of the
structure. We therefore designated this punctate structure
the `pre-autophagosomal structure'.

Class B apg mutants have a defect in the
localization of Aut7p on the pre-autophagosomal
structure
In class B mutants Daut1, Daut2, Dapg5, Dapg7, Dapg10
and Dapg12, Apg5p±GFP was detected on the pre-auto-
phagosomal structure; GFP±Aut7p was not. Interestingly,
these are the genes involved in the two ubiquitin-like
conjugation systems: the Aut7 system (Daut2, Dapg7
and Daut1) and the Apg12p±Apg5p conjugation system
(Dapg12, Dapg7, Dapg10 and Dapg5). In the Dapg1Dapg7
double mutant, GFP±Aut7p did not localize to the pre-
autophagosomal structure (Table I). This result demon-
strates that APG7 (class B) is epistatic to APG1 (class A)
for the localization of Aut7p, suggesting that the class B
APG genes govern the localization of Aut7p to the pre-
autophagosomal structure prior to class A gene function.
As previously reported, mutants of the Aut7 system lacked
detectable Aut7p±PE (Figure 7; Ichimura et al., 2000).
These studies demonstrated that the localization of
GFP±Aut7p to the pre-autophagosomal structure is tightly
coupled to Aut7p lipidation. The association of Aut7p with
the pre-autophagosomal structure occurs with the PE-
conjugated form. In Daut1 or Daut2 mutant, the Apg12p±
Apg5p conjugate is formed normally (Mizushima et al.,
1998); Apg5p±GFP was localized on the pre-autophago-
somal structure, as seen in wild-type cells (Table I).
Therefore, the lipidation of Aut7p is essential for the
localization of Aut7p, but not required for localization of
(Apg12p±)Apg5p to the pre-autophagosomal structure.
Interestingly, Apg5p±GFP was detected on the pre-
autophagosomal structure in mutants of the Apg12 system
(Dapg12 and Dapg10; Table I), suggesting that the
conjugation of Apg12p is not necessary for Apg5p
localization. In Apg12 system mutants (Dapg12, Dapg10
and Dapg5), we could not detect GFP±Aut7p on the pre-
autophagosomal structure (Table I). In addition, these
mutants
demonstrated
severely
reduced
levels
of
Aut7p±PE (Figure 7). A defect in the membrane associ-
ation of Aut7p in Apg12p conjugation mutants (Kim et al.,
2001) may be explained by decreases in the total level of
Aut7p±PE in the absence of the conjugate.

(A) Although temperature-sensitive Apg1p was detectable, the
maturation of API was completely blocked at 37°C in apg1ts cells. The
API proform (proAPI) is processed to mature API (mAPI) in an Apg1p
activity-dependent manner. Wild-type cells (TN125), Dapg1 cells
(YYK126) and Dapg1 cells (YYK126) carrying the apg1ts plasmid
were grown in YEPD medium at 23°C or 37°C overnight. Apg1p and
API were detected as described in Materials and methods. (B) Dapg1

To examine the effects of the disruption of the
Apg12p±Apg5p conjugate on Aut7p localization, we
estimated the levels of Aut7p±PE in Daut2 cells expressing
the carboxy-terminal processed form of Aut7p (Aut7FGp;
Ichimura et al., 2000; Kirisako et al., 2000). Aut2p/Apg4p,
a cysteine protease, is essential for Aut7p processing and
Aut7p±PE
deconjugation.
Aut7p±PE
accumulates
in
Daut2 cells expressing Aut7FGp because of the inability
of these cells to deconjugate Aut7p±PE (Kirisako et al.,
2000). The levels of Aut7p±PE in Daut2Dapg10 and
Daut2Dapg12 cells were reduced from the levels in Daut2
cells,
but
Aut7p±PE
was
actually
generated
in
Daut2Dapg10 and Daut2Dapg12 cells (Figure 10). This
result indicates the Apg12p±Apg5p conjugate is not
essential for Aut7p±PE formation. We then constructed a
GFP±Aut7FG
plasmid,
which
we
expressed
in
Daut2Dapg10 and Daut2Dapg12 cells. Although signi®-
cant amounts of Aut7p±PE were produced in these
mutants (Figure 10), GFP±Aut7FGp did not localize to
the pre-autophagosomal structure (Table I). This result
indicates that the Apg12p±Apg5p conjugate is absolutely
required for the proper localization of Aut7p. The role of
the conjugate is not restricted to the localization of Aut7p,
however, as Dapg5 cells possess more severe defects in
API maturation than the Daut7 cells (Abeliovich et al.,
1999, 2000).
Class C apg mutants do not deliver either Apg5p
or Aut7p to the pre-autophagosomal structure
In class C mutants, Dvps30, Dapg9, Dapg14 and Dapg16,
neither Apg5p±GFP nor GFP±Aut7p localized to the pre-
autophagosomal structure. VPS30 and APG14 are the
genes involved in the autophagy-speci®c PI3-kinase
complex. Double disruptant Dapg1Dvps30 or Dapg1-
Dapg9, expressing GFP±Aut7p demonstrated a diffuse
cytoplasmic staining pattern (Table I). This result indicates
that VPS30 and APG9 (class C) are epistatic to APG1
(class A) in the organization of the pre-autophagosomal
structure. Therefore, the class C APG genes play roles in
the organization of Apg5p and Aut7p on the pre-
autophagosomal structure in a class A gene-independent
manner. We further analysed the levels of Aut7p±PE in
these mutants. Dapg16 cells contained signi®cant levels of
Aut7p±PE during vegetative growth (Figure 7A). The ratio
of Aut7p±PE to unmodi®ed Aut7p, however, decreased
after nitrogen starvation (Figure 7B). The levels of
Aut7p±PE in growing cells and starved cells were similar
(data not shown), indicating that the synthesis of Aut7p
during starvation resulted in a decrease in the relative
levels of Aut7p±PE in Dapg16 cells. In contrast, Dvps30,
Dapg9, Dapg14 cells possessed normal levels of Aut7p±
PE, regardless of the nutrient conditions (Figure 7).
Apg16p is a coiled-coil protein linking the Apg12p±
Apg5p conjugates (Mizushima et al., 1999). Although the
Apg12p±Apg5p conjugate was formed, we did not observe
a dot structure of Apg5p±GFP in Dapg16 cells (Table I).
This observation suggests that the interaction of Apg5p
and Apg16p is necessary for the proper localization of
Apg5p to the pre-autophagosomal structure. Although
Aut7p±PE was formed in the Dapg16 mutant during
vegetative growth (Figure 7A), we could not observe the
localization of Aut7p to the pre-autophagosomal structure
(Table I). This phenotype is similar to that of Daut2-
Dapg10 or Daut2Dapg12 cells expressing GFP±Aut7FGp
(Table I), which contain signi®cant levels of Aut7p±PE
(Figure 10). This result indicates that Apg12p±Apg5p±
Apg16p complex formation is needed for the localization
of Aut7p. As the Dapg16 mutant failed to maintain
Aut7p±PE levels during starvation, the Apg12p±Apg5p±
Apg16p complex must be necessary for the maintenance
of Aut7p±PE levels.
Two types of PI3-kinase complex contain Vps34p,
Vps15p and Vps30p/Apg6p as common components
(Kihara et al., 2001a). In these complexes, Apg14p and
Vps38p are the components specifying autophagy or the
carboxypeptidase Y (CPY), a vacuolar resident enzyme,
sorting pathway, respectively. In Dapg14 cells, Aut7p and
Apg5p were located diffusely throughout the cytoplasm,
whereas in Dvps38 cells, the pre-autophagosomal structure
was detectable (Table I). In Dvps30 and Dapg14 strains,
Aut7p±PE and the Apg12p±Apg5p conjugate were pro-
duced normally (Figure 7; Mizushima et al., 1998). These
results indicate that the autophagy-speci®c PI3-kinase
complex is essential to recruit Aut7p±PE and the
Apg12p±Apg5p conjugate to the pre-autophagosomal
structure. The Dapg9 mutant also demonstrates class C
phenotype. A physical interaction of Apg9p with other
Apg proteins, however, has not been identi®ed. Our results
suggest that Apg9p has some relationship with the
autophagy-speci®c PI3-kinase complex.
Discussion
We and other groups have reported the intracellular
localization of several Apg proteins forming a punctate
structure close to the vacuole. The physiological signi®c-
ance of this punctate structure, however, has not been
examined in detail. Here, we systematically investigated
the localization of GFP-tagged Apg proteins when
expressed at physiological levels. These analyses identi-
®ed a novel `pre-autophagosomal structure', in which
Apg1p, Apg2p, Apg5p, Aut7p and Apg16p are assembled.
Apg5p and Aut7p are recruited to the structure by the
action of Apg16p and the autophagy-speci®c PI3-kinase
complex. The Apg1p protein kinase complex is also
localized to the structure. This kinase functions in concert
with the Apg12p±Apg5p±Apg16p complex and Aut7p to
play a crucial role in generating autophagosomes. Our
characterization of this structure found that Apg proteins
exist in three functional groups, the Apg1p protein kinase
complex, the ubiquitin-like systems (the Apg12 system

and the Aut7 system) and the autophagy-speci®c PI3-
kinase complex. Epistatic analyses of the apg mutant
phenotypes clearly uncovered the interrelationship on the
pre-autophagosomal structure between these three groups.
Although the functions of the APG2 and APG9 genes
remain unknown, we obtained results suggesting that these
genes encode proteins acting close to the Apg1p protein
kinase complex and the autophagy-speci®c PI3-kinase
complex, respectively.
The pre-autophagosomal structure
Following rapamycin treatment, the ¯uorescence of
GFP±Aut7p and other GFP-fused Apg proteins visualizing
the pre-autophagosomal structure rapidly increases in
intensity (data not shown). The amount of Aut7p increases
during autophagy, whereas there is no signi®cant increase
in Apg1p, Apg2p, Apg5p or Apg16p. These results suggest
the further recruitment of Apg proteins to the pre-
autophagosomal structure by unknown mechanisms. This
change in the composition of the pre-autophagosomal
structure may initiate autophagosome formation.
Repeated cell fractionation analyses of Apg proteins
have not uncovered a biochemical identi®cation of the pre-
autophagosomal fraction. It is likely that low levels of each
Apg protein are recruited onto the structure; in addition,
the structure may be unstable in cell lysates, leading to
dif®culties in its biochemical characterization. Aut7p is
concentrated on premature autophagosomes, isolation
membranes and Aut7p-enriched regions near the vacuole,
as determined by immunoelectron microscopy (Kirisako
et al., 1999). This Aut7p-enriched region is one candidate
for the pre-autophagosomal structure. Our intensive
examination of Aut7p-concentrated structures, however,
has not succeeded in identifying a de®nite membrane
structure corresponding to the pre-autophagosomal struc-
ture. The structure may not be observable under an
electron microscope as a de®ned membrane compartment.
At present, our analyses, based on ¯uorescence micro-
scopy, are the most promising investigations dissecting the
process of autophagosome formation.
We demonstrated that the pre-autophagosomal structure
is a functional structure rather than a dead-end structure.
Temperature shift experiments using the apg1ts strain
indicated that several dots separated from the pre-
autophagosomal structure at a permissive temperature
(Figure 9B) to subsequently stain the vacuole (Figure 9C).
This result indicates that the pre-autophagosomal structure
is an organizing centre for autophagosomes. Each dot
corresponds to the pre-autophagosomal structure or an
autophagosome; the weakly stained dots seen in later
stages (12 min and 13.5 min in Figure 9B) may be
autophagosomes.
The organization of the pre-autophagosomal structure is
not affected in the class A mutants, Dapg1, apg2, Dapg13
or Dapg17. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Apg1p is a
component
of
the
pre-autophagosomal
structure
(Figure 2D±F). Apg13p and Apg17p are also likely
components of the structure, as Apg1p interacts directly
with Apg13p and Apg17p (Kamada et al., 2000). In
response to nutrient depletion, enhanced activity of the
Apg1p kinase complex controls switching from Cvt
vesicle formation to autophagosome formation. Aut7p
is normally induced in Dapg1 cells by rapamycin or
starvation (Kirisako et al., 1999). Therefore, the Apg1p
kinase complex plays a role in both the induction of
autophagy and the initiation of autophagosome formation.
The delivery of GFP±Apg1p to the vacuolar lumen during
rapamycin treatment (data not shown) also supports the
involvement of Apg1p in the latter stage of autophago-
some formation.
Organization of the pre-autophagosomal structure
Aut7p±PE is an essential component of the pre-auto-
phagosomal structure (Table I and Figure 7). We demon-
strated that the absence of the Apg12p±Apg5p conjugate
results in a severe decrease in Aut7p±PE levels (Figure 7).
GFP±Aut7FGp is not detected on the pre-autophagosomal
structure in Daut2Dapg10, Daut2Dapg12 cells (Table I)
despite signi®cant levels of Aut7p±PE (Figure 10). These
data suggest that the Apg12p±Apg5p conjugate must play
a role in the localization of Aut7p±PE. On treatment with
rapamycin, however, Daut7 cells demonstrate some degree
of API maturation, whereas Dapg5 cells possess no mature
API (Abeliovich et al., 1999, 2000; Kirisako et al., 2000).
This
suggests
that
the
conjugate
is
essential
for
both autophagosome formation and the maintenance of
Aut7p±PE localized to the pre-autophagosomal structure.
Apg16p forms a complex with the Apg12p±Apg5p
conjugate (Mizushima et al., 1999). GFP±Aut7p exhibits a
diffuse staining pattern in Dapg16 cells, regardless of the
normal levels of Aut7p±PE present during vegetative
growth (Figure 7A). Dapg16 mutant failed to increase the
level of Aut7p±PE during starvation (Figure 7B). Apg16p
may participate in the maintenance of the Aut7p±PE levels
during starvation. Apg5p±GFP also possesses a diffuse
pattern throughout the cytosol in Dapg16 cells (Figure 6L).
The localization of Apg16p to the structure (Figure 2G±I)
suggests that Apg16p plays a role in targeting the
AApg12p±Apg5p conjugate to the pre-autophagosomal
structure. In Dapg16 cells, Aut7p±PE may not be localized
on the pre-autophagosomal structure due to a lack of the
AApg12p±Apg5p-Apg16p complex.
We could not identify GFP±Aut7p punctate structures in
growing Dapg9 cells (Table I); the punctate structures are
reported in Dapg9 cells under nitrogen-starved conditions
(Kim et al., 2001). To investigate the localization of
GFP±Aut7p during autophagy, we examined GFP±Aut7p
in rapamycin-treated Dapg9 cells. We observed a similar
punctate staining pattern similar to that described by Kim
et al. (2001; data not shown). These punctate structures,
however, were less distinct and of a lower intensity than
those seen in Dapg1 cells (data not shown). This result
suggests that Apg9p plays an important role in the
recruitment of Aut7p to the pre-autophagosomal structure.
The autophagy-speci®c PI3-kinase complex controls the
organization of the pre-autophagosomal structure but the
PI3-kinase complex speci®c to the CPY pathway does not.
In autophagy-speci®c PI3-kinase complex mutants, both
Aut7p±PE and the Apg12p±Apg5p conjugate are produced
normally, indicating that these conjugation reactions occur
in the absence of the complex. One possible function of the
autophagy-speci®c PI3-kinase complex is to select cargo
during vesicle budding (Kihara et al., 2001a). The
complex may load Aut7p±PE and/or the Apg12p±Apg5p
conjugate into vesicles to facilitate their transport to the
pre-autophagosomal structure. A second possibility is that
K.Suzuki et al.

----- Page 9 (native) -----
the complex plays a role in vesicular sorting, allowing
those containing Aut7p±PE and/or the Apg12p±Apg5p
conjugate to be delivered to the pre-autophagosomal
structure. There is also a third possibility, that the PI3-
kinase complex provides the pre-autophagosomal struc-
ture with phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P); PI3P
then mediates the localization of the Apg12p±Apg5p
conjugate and Aut7p±PE to the structure. Analysis of the
autophagy-speci®c PI3-kinase during the organization of
the pre-autophagosomal structure will further the under-
standing of general membrane dynamics mediated by PI3-
kinases.
Here, we de®ne a pre-autophagosomal structure, which
is directly involved in the formation of autophagosomes.
We also propose speci®c interrelationships between the
many APG genes. This report provides insights into the
precise functions of Apg proteins.

Plasmids
In this study, centromeric plasmids were used to produce physiological
levels of expression. The pRS316 GFP±AUT7 plasmid was created by
substituting the 33 haemagglutinin sequence immediately after the start
codon of the AUT7 open reading frame (ORF) in pTK108 (Kirisako et al.,
1999) with a modi®ed GFP sequence (S65T), following digestion by
BamHI. The pRS316 GFP±AUT7FG plasmid was created by substituting
the 33 myc sequence immediately after the start codon of the pRS316
AUT7FG (Kirisako et al., 2000). The pRS314 ECFP±AUT7 plasmid was
created by cloning an enhanced CFP (ECFP) fragment, ampli®ed from
pECFP (Clontech), into pRS316 GFP±AUT7 digested with BamHI. From
the resulting pRS316 ECFP±AUT7, we subcloned an excised SacI±XhoI
fragment into pRS314. The pRS314 APG5±GFP and the pRS416 APG9±
GFP plasmids were the generous gifts of Dr D.J.Klionsky (University of
Michigan). Site-directed mutagenesis using QuikChange (Stratagene)
was used to insert a BamHI site into pYAPG507, immediately before the
stop codon of the APG5 ORF (Kametaka et al., 1998) to create the
pRS316 APG5-EYFP plasmid. An enhanced YFP (EYFP) fragment was
ampli®ed from pEYFP (Clontech), digested with BamHI and cloned into
the BamHI site of pYAPG507.
The pRS316 YFP±APG1 plasmid was created by inserting the BamHI
cassette of EYFP immediately after the start codon of the APG1 ORF.
Site-directed mutagenesis then inserted a BglII site using QuikChange
The pRS314 APG16±YFP plasmid was created by inserting the NotI
cassette of EYFP immediately before the stop codon of the APG16 ORF
(Mizushima et al., 1999).
Immunoblot analysis
To detect either the GFP±Aut7p or Apg12p±Apg5p±GFP conjugate,
lysates were prepared from cells grown in SD + CA medium to a density
of ~OD600 = 1 by NaOH/2-mercaptoethanol extraction with a slight
modi®cation (Horvath and Reizman, 1994). Brie¯y, anti-Aut7p anti-
serum (Kirisako et al., 2000) and anti-Apg12 antiserum (A.Kuma,
N.Mizushima, N.Ishihara and Y.Ohsumi, in preparation), respectively,
were used as the primary antibodies. To detect Apg1p and API, we
utilized anti-Apg1p antiserum (Matsuura et al., 1997) and anti-
aminopeptidase I antiserum (gift from Dr D.J.Klionsky) as the primary
antibodies, respectively. Aut7p±PE was detected following SDS±PAGE
in the presence of 6 M urea, as described (Kirisako et al., 2000). We
collected cells that had been either grown in YEPD medium to a density
of ~OD600 = 1 or then starved in SD (±N) medium. Harvested cells were
then washed with distilled water and disrupted with glass beads (Sigma)
for 5 min in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris±HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl,
5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl ¯uoride
(PMSF; Sigma) and a protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete; Roche). Cell
lysates were boiled in SDS sample buffer for 5 min. Equal protein
amounts (20 mg protein) were subjected to electrophoresis, transferred to
PVDF membrane (Millipore) and detected with a combination of anti-
Aut7p antibody and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody
(Seikagaku Kogyo) by the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).
Protein concentration was measured using a BCA reagent kit (Pierce).
Microscopy
Fluorescence microscopy was performed using a DeltaVision microscope
(Applied Precision). FM4-64 (Molecular Probes) was used to identify the
vacuolar membrane under a ¯uorescence microscope. Growing cells were
incubated with 1 mg/ml FM4-64 for 15 min and then chased for 30 min at
30°C. The labelled cells were visualized by ¯uorescence microscopy
using a Texas Red ®lter. To observe GFP-tagged proteins under a
¯uorescence microscope, we employed a FITC ®lter. A dual band ®lter
set for CFP and YFP (86002; Chroma Technology Corp.), was used to
detect the localization of CFP- and YFP-tagged proteins. Culture
temperatures were controlled with a DTC3 culture dish system
(Bioptechs) during time-lapse video microscopy.
Immuno¯uorescence
microscopy
was
performed
as
previously
described (Nishikawa et al., 1994). Cells harboring the APG9±GFP
plasmids were grown in SD + CA medium to a density of ~OD600 = 1.5.
Cultures were then treated with 0.5 mg/ml rapamycin for 2 h and
subsequently ®xed in 5% formaldehyde. Cells were then converted into
spheroplasts and permeabilized with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100
for 10 min at room temperature. Next, the cells were dropped onto
multiwell slide glasses (Cel-line Associates), pre-coated with polylysine
(Sigma). Af®nity-puri®ed anti-Aut7p antibody was used as the primary
antibody, followed by incubation with the Cy5-conjugated secondary
antibody (Amersham). For double labelling with GFP-tagged proteins, we
used Cy5, a ¯uorescent dye (Ex: 649 nm and Em: 670 nm), to minimize
the bleeding of the ¯uorescence into the GFP channel (Ex: 489 nm and
Em: 511 nm). GFP and Cy5 were visualized with the FITC and the Cy5
®lter sets, respectively.
ALP assay
Autophagic activities were estimated by measuring ALP activity in cells
expressing a cytosolic proform of the phosphatase (Pho8D60p; Noda
et al., 1995). a-naphthyl phosphate (Sigma) was used as a substrate.
Pho8D60p is transported to the vacuole via autophagy and processed in
the vacuolar lumen to become active.
Generation of the apg1ts allele
APG1 was mutagenized by previously described PCR procedures
(Cadwell and Joyce, 1995). The mutagenized gene was co-transformed
into YYK190 cells with a gapped pRS316 plasmid, containing portions
homologous to both ends of the PCR product. Two hundred and four
colonies were picked and patched onto YEPD plates, which were then
incubated overnight at 30 and 37°C. Cells were then subjected to
treatment with 0.4 mg/ml rapamycin at each temperature. We examined
the generation of autophagic bodies under a phase-contrast microscope.
Plasmids recovered from the 22 colonies that passed the initial screening
were used to re-transform YYK190 cells to con®rm the temperature-
sensitive phenotype.
Eight strains that passed the initial screening were subjected to an ALP
assay to quantify autophagic activity. YYK126 cells were transformed
with each candidate plasmid. Cells were cultured in YEPD medium at
23°C; ALP activities were measured after a 6 h nitrogen starvation at 23
or 37°C. Five strains were ®nally con®rmed as temperature-sensitive
mutants. Two of the ®ve strains exhibiting clear temperature sensitivity
were used for further analysis. The plasmids recovered from these two
strains possessed identical sequences. This allele was used as apg1ts. The
temperature sensitivity resulted from the following amino acid substitu-
tions: L88H, F112L and S158P.
