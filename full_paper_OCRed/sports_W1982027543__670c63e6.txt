In this study, we deﬁned the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor  (PPAR) in metabolic homeostasis by using subtype
selective agonists. Analysis of rat L6 myotubes treated with the PPAR
subtype-selective agonist, GW501516, by the Affymetrix oligonucle-
otide microarrays revealed that PPAR controls fatty acid oxidation by
regulating genes involved in fatty acid transport, -oxidation, and
mitochondrial respiration. Similar PPAR-mediated gene activation
was observed in the skeletal muscle of GW501516-treated mice.
Accordingly, GW501516 treatment induced fatty acid -oxidation in
L6 myotubes as well as in mouse skeletal muscles. Administration of
GW501516 to mice fed a high-fat diet ameliorated diet-induced
obesity and insulin resistance, an effect accompanied by enhanced
metabolic rate and fatty acid -oxidation, proliferation of mitochon-
dria, and a marked reduction of lipid droplets in skeletal muscles.
Despite a modest body weight change relative to vehicle-treated
mice, GW501516 treatment also markedly improved diabetes as
revealed by the decrease in plasma glucose and blood insulin levels
in genetically obese obob mice. These data suggest that PPAR is
pivotal to control the program for fatty acid oxidation in the skeletal
muscle, thereby ameliorating obesity and insulin resistance through
its activation in obese animals.

besity is one of the most prevalent and serious chronic
disorders in industrialized societies. Frequently, it clusters
with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia in the
so-called metabolic syndrome X (1). Obesity causes excess fat
accumulation in various tissues; most notoriously in adipose
tissues, but also in other insulin-responsive organs, such as
skeletal muscle and liver, predisposing to the development of
insulin resistance. Especially, insulin resistance in skeletal mus-
cle is a hallmark feature of type 2 diabetes (2, 3). Yet, the
molecular mechanisms of the pathogenesis of insulin resistance
and obesity have not been fully clarified and effective therapeutic
approaches are currently of general interest.
The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are
members of the nuclear receptor superfamily that function as fatty
acid-activated transcription factors (4). There are three related
PPAR family members: PPAR, PPAR, and PPAR (hereaf-
ter referred to as PPAR), with different ligand specificities and
tissue distributions. PPAR is highly expressed in liver, where it
controls peroxisomal and mitochondrial fatty acid catabolism,
whereas PPAR is abundant in adipose tissues functioning as the
key transcriptional factor for adipogenesis. Synthetic ligands for
PPAR, such as the fibrates, are used for the treatment of hyper-
lipidemia, whereas synthetic PPAR ligands, such as the thiazo-
lidinediones, are increasingly used to treat type 2 diabetes (5).
PPAR is expressed in many tissues including skeletal muscle and
brown adipose tissue (BAT) (5). Although several polyunsaturated
fatty acids and eicosanoids have been shown to act as putative
ligands for PPAR, displaying overlapping ligand specificity with
PPAR (6), the physiological role of PPAR is still unclear.
Through a gain-of-function approach using adipose tissue-specific
PPAR transgenic mice, Wang et al. (7) demonstrated that PPAR
activation in adipose tissue leads to enhanced fatty acid oxidation,
improved lipid profiles, and reduced adiposity. Interestingly, these
PPAR-transgenic mice are completely resistant to both high-fat-
diet-induced and genetically predisposed obesity.
Recently potent PPAR agonists have been developed and
shown to increase plasma HDL cholesterol levels in both mice
and nonhuman primates (8, 9). The increase in HDL cholesterol
levels occurs through an increase of cholesterol efflux from the
cells secondary to an increase in the expression of the reverse
cholesterol transporter ATP-binding cassette AI (8). Further-
more, when dosed to insulin-resistant middle-aged obese rhesus
monkeys, GW501516 lowered the fasting plasma levels of insulin
without changing the glucose levels.
Because the skeletal muscle is the major target organ of insulin,
we investigated the role of PPAR in skeletal muscle, especially in
relation to the insulin sensitivity. We demonstrated that activation
of PPAR by the selective agonist GW501516 induced the expres-
sion of key molecules involved in fatty acid oxidation and energy
expenditure, as well as in adaptive thermogenesis, PPAR coacti-
vator-1 (PGC-1) (10). Most importantly, GW501516 treatment
enhanced fatty acid -oxidation in the skeletal muscle, protected
against diet-induced obesity, and improved glucose tolerance and
insulin sensitivity. Here, we present evidence that PPAR is a key
target for the intervention and prevention of obesity and type 2
diabetes.

Experimental Procedures
The methods used in this study are described in detail in
Supporting Materials and Methods, which is published as sup-
porting information on the PNAS web site.
Affymetrix Oligonucleotide Microarray Analysis. Hybridization sam-
ples were prepared according to the Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA)
instructions as described (11). Briefly, 10 g of total RNA was used
to generate first-strand cDNA. After second-strand synthesis, bio-
tinylated and amplified RNA were purified by using RNeasy
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and quantitated by a spectrophotometer.
Biotinylated cRNA samples were then hybridized to Affymetrix Rat
U34 sub A arrays. These arrays contain probe sets for 8,000
transcripts and EST clones. After hybridization, microarrays
were washed, scanned, and analyzed with the GENECHIP software
(Affymetrix).
Animals and Diets. C57BL6J and obob mice (male, 5 weeks of age)
were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. The mice were
housed individually in a temperature- and humidity-controlled
(26.5°C and 35%) facility with a 12-h lightdark cycle (0900 to 2100
hours). All animals were allowed free access to water and diets.
Mice were fed a normal chow diet (CE-2; CLEA Japan, Osaka) or
a high-fat diet (HFD) containing 35% fat, 22% casein, 7% dextrin,
30% maltose, and 3.5% minerals. Food consumption was moni-
tored daily and body weight was recorded every other day. PPAR
agonists were given at 10 mlkg of body weight by oral intubation
in 3% arabic gum daily between 1030 and 1100 hours. Glucose
tolerance tests (GTTs) and insulin tolerance tests (ITTs) were
performed on days 21 and 28, respectively, after administration was
started.
Statistical Analyses. The data are presented as means  SE. The
homogeneity in variance was evaluated by a Bartlett test followed
by a parametric or nonparametric Dunnett’s multiple comparison
test (one-sided). The Student or Aspin–Welch t test (one-sided) was
used to compare the data between the control and treated groups.
A P value 0.05 was considered significant.
Results
PPAR Agonists Increase Transcripts for Fatty Acid Oxidation and
Energy Dissipation in Cultured Myotubes. To characterize the regu-
lation of gene expression during PPAR activation in vitro, we
performed oligonucleotide microarrays analysis of rat L6 myotube
myoblast cells treated with the PPAR agonist, GW501516.
GW501516 is a subtype-selective ligand for PPAR with an appar-
ent Kd value of 1 nM, and has 1,000-fold higher affinity toward
PPAR than the other subtypes, PPAR and PPAR (8). The
selection of a muscle cell line was based on the fact that skeletal
muscle is the largest tissue determining the insulin sensitivity of the
whole body and PPAR is expressed at a very high level in muscle;
the other PPAR family members, PPAR and PPAR, are ex-
pressed to a much lower level in the skeletal muscle (5). We
differentiated L6 myoblasts to myotubes under the standard dif-
ferentiation protocol, added GW501516, and prepared RNA. The

was measured by using oligonucleotide microarrays (Affymetrix).
As shown in Table 1, we identified a series of genes that are critical
for many aspects of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, including
intracellular fatty acid transport, fatty acid activation, mitochondrial
fatty acid -oxidation, electron transport, and ketogenesis (Fig. 1 A
and B). The mRNAs for pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4)
that spares glucose oxidation and gluconeogenesis, and PGC-1, a
master regulator of the thermogenic program, were also robustly
induced. Consistent with the absence of any effect of PPAR and
PPAR on muscle gene expression (8), agonists of PPAR, such as
fenofibric acid (FEN), and of PPAR, such as ciglitazone (CIG),
showed very little or no effect on the expression of the genes that
were examined above (Fig. 1A).
Next we examined whether GW501516 has the ability to enhance
the fatty acid oxidation in L6 myotubes by using [1-14C]palmitate as
a substrate. L6 rat myoblasts were therefore differentiated into
myotubes, treated with various PPARs agonists, and [1-14C]palmi-
tate oxidation was measured. As shown in Fig. 1 C–E, only PPAR
agonists, such as GW501516 and carbaprostacyclin (cPGI2), in-
creased fatty acid oxidation in L6 myotubes in a dose-dependent
manner (1.6-fold at 100 nM; P  0.002; Fig. 1 C and D). In contrast,
PPAR or PPAR agonists had no effect on fatty acid oxidation
in L6 myotubes at the concentration we used (Fig. 1E).
PPAR Agonists Stimulate Fatty Acid Oxidation in Skeletal Muscles.
Next, we examined whether treatment with PPAR agonists could
stimulate fatty acid oxidation in vivo, especially in oxidative tissues
including skeletal muscle, liver, and BAT (Fig. 2). Mice fed a
normal chow diet were treated with GW501516 for 1 week (see
Experimental Procedures), were killed, and were subjected for
[1-14C]palmitate oxidation measurement. In the quadriceps muscle,
GW501516 enhanced fatty acid -oxidation in a dose-dependent
manner (1.8-fold at 10 mgkg treatment), whereas little or no
induction was observed by PPAR or PPAR agonists (Fig. 2 A and
D). In contrast, hepatic -oxidation was not induced by GW501516
(Fig. 2E), presumably due to the low expression of PPAR in the
liver. As a control agonist for PPAR, fenofibrate (FEN) strongly
increased hepatic -oxidation (Fig. 2E). We also observed a modest
increase of fatty acid oxidation by GW501516 in intrascapular BAT
(data not shown). These data demonstrate that GW501516 pro-
motes fatty acid oxidation mainly in the skeletal muscle, but not in
the liver.
We then examined whether increased fatty acid oxidation in the
skeletal muscle affected the levels of lipid-derived substrates, such
as nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs), triglyceride (TG), and ketone
bodies in the circulation. Although plasma TG levels were not
altered significantly, the plasma levels of free fatty acids and ketone
bodies were significantly decreased (Fig. 2 B, C, and F). This result
decrease in the levels of ketone bodies was also confirmed in other
experiments (Table 2, which is published as supporting information
on the PNAS web site).
To confirm that GW501516-induced -oxidation in skeletal
muscle in vivo was also associated with increased expression of
genes involved in -oxidation (listed in Table 1), we analyzed the
expression of some representative genes by real-time quantitative
PCR assay (Supporting Materials and Methods and Tables 3 and 4,
which are published as supporting information on the PNAS web
site). The levels of mRNA expression were determined in individual
animals, and the average expression for each group is presented. As
expected, GW501516 also significantly increased mRNA expres-
sion in vivo in skeletal muscle for proteins involved in fatty acid
catabolism, including fatty acid transport protein (FATP) and
long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD), energy expenditure,
such as uncoupling protein (UCP) 2 and UCP3, and the thermo-
genic cofactor PGC-1 (Fig. 2G). Interestingly, these mRNAs
induced by PPAR agonist both in vitro and in vivo (Table 1 and
Fig. 2G) were also up-regulated in skeletal muscle during starvation
(J.Y. and J.S., unpublished data).
GW501516 Treatment Protects Against Diet-Induced Obesity. We
predicted that enhanced fatty acid utilization and energy expendi-
ture would protect against diet-induced obesity; accordingly, we
examined the long-term effects of treatment with a PPAR agonist
on the development of obesity. Because prolonged administration
of 10 mgkg GW501516 to animals caused hepatomegaly and
stimulated fatty acid oxidation in the liver (data not shown), we
selected the dose of 3 mgkg GW501516 for long-term adminis-
tration studies. To induce obesity, mice were fed with an HFD
containing 35% fat and 30% maltose. On feeding this high-calorie
diet, male C57BL6J mice showed a significant increase in the rate
of body weight gain compared with animals fed a normal chow diet
(terminal body weight: chow diet group, 27.8  0.7 g vs. HFD group,
42.4  1.2 g, P  0.0001, n  5; Fig. 3A). In contrast, GW501516
treatment of mice resulted in significantly reduced body weight gain
compared with the vehicle-treated mice on an HFD: the rate of
body weight gain on feeding an HFD in GW501516-treated mouse
group was approximately half that of the vehicle group (Fig. 3A).
Statistical differences were observed as early as 19 days after
initiation of the treatment. Importantly, daily food consumption of
GW501516-treated mice was similar to that of vehicle-treated mice
(Fig. 3B). Normal-chow-fed mice did not exhibit a reduced body
weight gain by GW501516 administration (Fig. 3A and Table 2). To
verify whether GW501516 affects the total body metabolic rate, we
measured oxygen consumption in whole animals (Fig. 3C). GW-
treated mice on an HFD displayed higher rates of oxygen con-
sumption than that of vehicle-treated mice on an HFD in the resting
state (P  0.05; Fig. 3C). These results indicate that GW501516
increases metabolic rate and contributes to the protective effect on

diet-induced obesity. Anatomical analysis revealed that this re-
duced body weight in GW501516-treated mice on feeding an HFD
was largely due to the reduced mass of visceral and epidermal fat
depots (Fig. 3D, see below). Histological analysis revealed signifi-
cant amelioration of diet-induced fat cell hypertrophy by
GW501516 in both epididymal white adipose tissue (WAT) and
BAT. The morphological change of fat cells by GW501516 treat-
ment was more profound in BAT than that in WAT (Fig. 3E). These
changes in adipose tissue morphology attenuated by GW501516
treatment indicate that HFD-induced adiposity is curtailed by
PPAR agonism. Consistent with the reduced fat mass and
morphological changes in adipose tissues, GW501516-treated ani-
mals did show an attenuation of HFD-induced hyperleptinemia
(Table 2).
GW501516 Treatment Prevents HFD-Induced Hepatic and Intramuscu-
lar Lipid Accumulation. Liver and skeletal muscle are the two most
important insulin-responsive organs in the body, and it is generally
believed that lipid accumulation in these tissues profoundly con-
tributes to the establishment of insulin resistance (12). Electron
microscopic comparison of skeletal muscles from GW501516- and
vehicle-treated mice fed an HFD showed that GW501516 treat-
ment almost completely eliminated intramuscular lipid droplets
around the mitochondrial region that were induced by HFD (Fig.
3F). Importantly, we also observed an appreciable proliferation of
mitochondria in the skeletal muscle of GW501516-treated mice
(Fig. 3F). HFD is known to induce hepatic steatosis. Histological
analysis indicated that mice maintained on an HFD accumulated
higher levels of hepatic lipid compared with those from normal-
chow-diet-fed mice (Fig. 3G). In contrast, GW501516 treatment
reduced hepatic lipid accumulation induced by HFD to the normal
levels. Consistent with the reduced hepatic lipid accumulation,
plasma alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase
activities were lowered to the normal levels by GW501516 treat-
ment, indicating that the fatty liver induced by HFD was almost
completely cured (Table 2). Real-time PCR analysis revealed that
gene transcripts for proteins involved in -oxidation including
acyl-CoA oxidase were elevated, whereas that for fatty acid syn-
thetase were reduced between GW501516- and vehicle-treated
mice on an HFD (data not shown), suggesting that the reduction in
liver lipid accumulation was subsequent to an increase in fatty acid
oxidation and lowered TG synthesis.
Effects of GW501516 Treatment on Insulin Sensitivity in Diet-Induced
Obese Mice. GW501516 treatment had no effects on fasting or
postprandial levels of blood glucose in mice fed a normal diet or an
HFD. In contrast, both fasting and postprandial levels of plasma
insulin were decreased by GW501516 treatment in mice on a
normal diet as well as on an HFD (Fig. 4 A, B, F, and G).
Furthermore, GTT and ITT revealed that GW501516 treatment
improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, respectively,
induced by HFD feeding (Fig. 4 C–E and H–J). These data suggest

that the increased fatty acid -oxidation in the skeletal muscle and
subsequent reduction in hepatic and intramuscular lipid content by
GW501516 could, at least in part, explain the improved insulin
sensitivity.
GW501516 Treatment of obob Mice Improves Glucose Tolerance and
Reduces Plasma Insulin Levels in Genetically Obese Mice. Next we
studied the antiobese and antidiabetic actions of PPAR in genet-
ically predisposed obese obob mice. obob mice display hyperpha-
gia, severe obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes, due to the lack
of leptin, a key WAT-derived signaling factor regulating body
weight and energy balance (13). Treatment of obob mice with
GW501516 did not affect food intake (4.23  0.1 gday; Fig. 5B and
Table 2). Interestingly, despite a very modest, yet significant, change
in body weight, GW501516-treated obob mice showed a signifi-
cantly improved glucose tolerance (Fig. 5 C and D). Despite similar
insulin levels, GW501516-treated animals had lower glucose levels
than the vehicle group in the fasting state (vehicle, 192.7  5.9
mgdl vs. GW501516, 151.8  9.4 mgdl; Fig. 5 C and D). One-hour
postprandial levels of plasma glucose and insulin in GW501516-
treated mice were much lower than those in vehicle-treated animals
(blood glucose: vehicle, 269.9  35.4 mgdl vs. GW501516, 155.4 
4.2 mgdl; and plasma insulin: vehicle, 32.5  4.1 ngml vs.
GW501516, 14.4  1.6 ngml). GTT also showed that glucose
tolerance was improved by GW501516 administration; however,
unexpectedly, GW501516-treated mice showed increased plasma
insulin levels during the GTT as compared with vehicle-treated
obob mice, pointing to an eventual contribution of the pancreas
(Fig. 5 E and F). Histological analysis revealed a reduction both in
number and size of lipid droplets in skeletal muscle and the
replacement of large lipid droplets with smaller droplets in BAT
(data not shown). Pancreatic islets from obob mice were severely
hypertrophic. The islet hypertrophy was normalized by GW501516
administration (Fig. 5G), presumably as a consequence of the
decreased insulin requirements caused by the increased insulin
sensitivity. Plasma TG, NEFA, and ketone bodies were decreased

of fatty acids in PPAR-expressing oxidative tissues, including
skeletal muscle and BAT.
Discussion: PPAR as a Key Target for Metabolic Syndrome
In this study, we highlighted, by using PPAR agonists, an impor-
tant role of PPAR in skeletal muscle, which is in addition to the
previously reported role of PPAR in adipose tissues (7). Through
a comprehensive transcriptional analysis in cultured myotube, we
discovered that the PPAR agonist stimulates almost the entire
program for fatty acid use and energy dissipation in skeletal muscle
(Table 1 and Figs. 2G and 3C). This increase in fatty acid -
oxidation and energy expenditure in skeletal muscle underpinned
the protective effect of PPAR agonists on the development of
obesity in C57BL6J mice on an HFD (Figs. 2 A, D, and G, and 3A).
Administration of GW501516 to both HFD and obob mice also
significantly improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. The
mechanism by which PPAR agonist improved insulin sensitivity in
obese mice is not fully clear at present, but the marked reduction
in lipid content in both skeletal muscle and liver (Fig. 3 F and G),
resulting from enhanced energy expenditure, can, at least in part,
account for the improved insulin sensitivity. Accumulation of excess
lipid in skeletal muscle or liver disturbs insulin signaling. In skeletal
muscle, this disturbance has been linked to impaired activity of the
insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1-associated phosphatidyl inositol
3-kinase (PI3-kinase), whereas in the liver this was attributed to the
impaired activity of IRS-2-associated PI3-kinase subsequent to
altered levels of adipose tissue-derived hormones such as leptin or
adiponectinACRP30 (12). The reduction of visceral obesity (Fig.
3D) may also explain in part the amelioration of insulin resistance
through a reduction in adipose tissue-derived hormone such as
TNF (14). Interestingly, and in contrast to the effect in HFD mice,
glucose tolerance improved, despite rather modest weight changes
in the obob mice (Fig. 5 A–E). Amelioration of diabetes in the
obob mice was associated with reduced pancreatic islet hypertro-
phy (Fig. 5G). This finding indicates that PPAR activation has a
potential positive effect on glucose-induced insulin secretion and
raises the possibility that PPAR may prevent or delay  cell loss
(15, 16). In fact, GW501516 treatment of the pancreatic islets
isolated from wild-type mice on normal chow diet significantly
stimulated glucose-induced insulin release in vitro (Y.I. and J.S.,
unpublished observation).
During starvation, glucose uptake and oxidation are reduced
rapidly in muscle, which shifts to use free fatty acids and ketone
bodies. It was interesting to note that the changes in gene expression
induced by GW501516 in vitro in cultured myotubes (Table 1 and
Fig. 1A) and in skeletal muscle in vivo (Fig. 2G) were very similar
to the gene expression profile induced by fasting in skeletal muscle
(J.Y. and J.S., unpublished data). On challenges such as cold
exposure, fasting, or prolonged exercise, lipolysis in WAT occurs.
The free fatty acids released into the circulation are taken up by
thermogenic tissues, such as BAT and skeletal muscle, where they
serve as fuel for adaptive thermogenesis. Hence, we are speculating
that one of the physiological roles of PPAR is to direct metabolism
from utilization of glucose to utilization of lipids in the fatty acid
-oxidation pathway. It is, therefore, conceivable that the free fatty
acids released from adipose tissue on fasting or exercise provide
PPAR with natural ligands to stimulate fatty acid oxidation and
thermogenesis in skeletal muscle. This idea is consistent with the
hypothesis that PPAR acts as a pivotal thermogenic transcription
factor (7).
Recent studies showed that PPAR directly interacts with
PGC-1 (7), and activates the CPT1 gene together with PGC-1
(17). We take this observation one step further by demonstrating
that PPAR not only activates PGC-1 but also stimulates PGC-1
mRNA levels both in vitro and in vivo (Figs. 1A and 2G), an effect
accompanied by mitochondrial biogenesis (Fig. 3F). In fact, the
PGC-1 promoter contains a highly conserved PPAR-responsive
element that is conserved among human, mouse, and rat, where
PPAR can directly bind (T.T. and J.S., unpublished observation),
suggesting that PPAR directly stimulates the PGC-1 gene ex-
pression. Mitochondrial oxidative and phosphorylation activity is
strongly correlated with insulin sensitivity (18). Exercise, starvation,
and cold increase the expression of PGC-1, subsequently increas-
ing the capacity for mitochondrial energy production through fatty
acid -oxidation. The induction of PGC-1 expression by PPAR
may also improve physical performance by an enhancement of
skeletal muscle respiratory capacity (1), a factor that could con-
tribute to the improved insulin sensitivity and obesity.
Taken together, we demonstrate PPAR agonists have a pro-
found antiobese and antidiabetic action in animal models. PPAR
is now a key target for metabolic syndrome, and our current data
may provide molecular bases for the intervention and prevention of
metabolic syndrome by highly effective PPAR agonists.
