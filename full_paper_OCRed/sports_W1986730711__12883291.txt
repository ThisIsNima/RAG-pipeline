Preface to the Fourth Edition
It is with great pleasure that I offer this fourth edition of Composite Materials:
Science and Engineering to the readers. The book has been thoroughly updated,
new material been been added in all chapters, plus a new chapter, Repair and
Recycling of Composites, has been added.
The third edition of this book saw the light of the day in 2012. Boeing 787 and
Airbus 350 XWB entered into service in 2012 and 2015, respectively. Those two
marked a major shift in the large-scale use of composites. Since then, GE and
Safran have made tremendous inroads into the use of ceramic matrix composites in
aircraft engines. The cover picture of this edition shows the LEAP engine, which
uses shrouds made of silicon carbide ﬁber/silicon carbide matrix composites. Those
developments are deservedly highlighted in this fourth edition. These developments
have also brought home our attention to repair and recycling of composites, because
nothing lasts forever. Inevitably there will be damage to components made of
composites, which will require repair. Additionally, there is the question of the end
of life of any component, which makes one think of recycling of composites. I have
added a new chapter covering these two areas.
I would like to make an interesting observation about the cover of this book. The
ﬁrst edition of the book had no cover picture. The second edtion had the picture of a
silicon carbide reinforced titanium alloy composite. The third edition had the pic-
ture of aircraft engine, GE90, which highlighted the fan blades made of carbon ﬁber
reinforced epoxy. The present, fourth edition, shows Leap aircraft engine that uses
components made of ceramic matrix composites. It has been a remarkable journey.
I am grateful to various institutions that funded my research work over the years;
this book would not have come about without that research work. Of course, this
kind of book is never produced as strictly the job of a single person. There are many
people who made this journey bearable, even enjoyable. Among the people with
whom I have had the privilege of collaborating over the years and who have
enriched my life, professional and otherwise, I should mention, in alphabetical
order, C.H. Barham, A.R. Boccaccini, K. Carlisle, K. Chawla, N. Chawla, X. Deng,
Z. Fang, the late M.E. Fine, S.G. Fishman, G. Gladysz, A. Goel, the late

Preface to the Third Edition
Since the publication of the second edition of this book, there has been a spate of
activity in the ﬁeld of composites, in the academia as well as in the industry. The
industrial activity, in particular, has been led by the large scale use of composites by
aerospace companies, mainly Boeing and Airbus. It would not be far off the mark to
say that the extensive use of carbon ﬁber/epoxy resin composites in Boeing 787
aircraft and a fairly large use of composites in Airbus’s A 380 aircraft represents a
paradigm shift. Boeing 787 has composites in the fuselage, windows, wings, tails,
stabilizers, etc. resulting in 50 percent in composites by weight. Nevertheless, it
should be pointed out that in reality, the extensive use of composites in aircraft is a
culmination of series of earlier steps over the decades since mid-1960s. Besides, the
large scale applications in the aerospace industry, there have been impressive
developments in other other ﬁelds such as automotive, sporting goods, supercon-
ductivity, etc.
All of this activity has led to a substantial addition of new material in this
edition. Among these are: Carbon/carbon brakes, nanocomposites, biocomposites,
self-healing composites, self-reinforced composites, ﬁber/metal laminate compos-
ites, composites for civilian aircraft, composites for aircraft jet engine, second
generation high temperature superconducting composites, WC/metal particulate
composites, new solved examples, and new problems, etc. In addition, I have added
a new chapter, called non-conventional composites. This chapter deals with some
non-conventional composites: Nanocomposites (polymer, metal, and ceramic
matrix), self healing composites, self reinforced composites, biocomposites, and
laminates made of bidimensional layers.
Once again, I plead guilty to the charge that the material contained in this edition
is more than can be covered in a normal, semester-long course. The instructor of
course can cut the content to his/her requirements. I have always had the broader
aim of providing a text that is suitable as a source of reference for the practicing
researcher, scientist, and engineer.

Alamos National Laboratory Sandia national Laboratory, Oak Ridge National
Laboratory, Smith International Inc., and Trelleborg, Inc. for supporting my
research work over the years, some of which is included in this text. Among the

Preface to the Second Edition
The ﬁrst edition of this book came out in 1987, offering an integrated coverage
of the ﬁeld of composite materials. I am gratiﬁed at the reception it received at the
hands of the students and faculty. The second edition follows the same format as the
ﬁrst one, namely, a well-balanced treatment of materials and mechanics aspects of
composites, with due recognition of the importance of the processing. The second
edition is a fully revised, updated, and enlarged edition of this widely used text.
There are some new chapters, and others have been brought up-to-date in light
of the extensive work done in the decade since publication of the ﬁrst edition. Many
people who used the ﬁrst edition as a classroom text urged me to include some
solved examples. In deference to their wishes I have done so. I am sorry that it took
me such a long time to prepare the second edition. Things are happening at a very
fast pace in the ﬁeld of composites, and there is no question that a lot of very
interesting and important work has been done in the past decade or so. Out of
necessity, one must limit the amount of material to be included in a textbook. In
spite of this view, it took me much more time than I anticipated. In this second
edition, I have resisted the temptation to cover the whole waterfront. So the reader
will ﬁnd here an up-to-date treatment of the fundamental aspects. Even so, I do
recognize that the material contained in this second edition is more than what can be
covered in the classroom in a semester. I consider that to be a positive aspect of the
book. The reader (student, researcher, practicing scientist/engineer) can proﬁtably
use this as a reference text. For the person interested in digging deeper into a
particular aspect, I provide an extensive and updated list of references and sug-
gested reading.
There remains the pleasant task of thanking people who have been very
helpful and a constant source of encouragement to me over the years: M.E. Fine,

Preface to the First Edition
The subject of composite materials is truly an inter- and multidisciplinary one.
People working in ﬁelds such as metallurgy and materials science and engineering,
chemistry and chemical engineering, solid mechanics, and fracture mechanics have
made important contributions to the ﬁeld of composite materials. It would be an
impossible task to cover the subject from all these viewpoints. Instead, we shall
restrict ourselves in this book to the objective of obtaining an understanding of
composite properties (e.g., mechanical, physical, and thermal) as controlled by their
structure at micro- and macro-levels. This involves a knowledge of the properties
of the individual constituents that form the composite system, the role of interface
between the components, the consequences of joining together, say, a ﬁber and
matrix material to form a unit composite ply, and the consequences of joining
together these unit composites or plies to form a macrocomposite, a macroscopic
engineering component as per some optimum engineering speciﬁcations. Time and
again, we shall be emphasizing this main theme, that is structure–property corre-
lations at various levels that help us to understand the behavior of composites.
In Part I, after an introduction (Chap. 1), fabrication and properties of the various
types of reinforcement are described with a special emphasis on microstructure–
property correlations (Chap. 2). This is followed by a chapter (Chap. 3) on the three
main types of matrix materials, namely, polymers, metals, and ceramics. It is
becoming increasingly evident that the role of the matrix is not just that of a binding
medium for the ﬁbers but it can contribute decisively toward the composite per-
formance. This is followed by a general description of the interface in composites
(Chap. 4). In Part II a detailed description is given of some of the important types of
composites (Chap. 5), metal matrix composites (Chap. 6), ceramic composites
(Chap. 7), carbon ﬁber composites (Chap. 8), and multiﬁlamentary superconducting
composites (Chap. 9). The last two are described separately because they are the
most advanced ﬁber composite systems of the 1960s and 1970s. Speciﬁc charac-
teristics and applications of these composite systems are brought out in these
chapters. Finally, in Part III, the micromechanics (Chap. 10) and macromechanics
(Chap. 11) of composites are described in detail, again emphasizing the theme of
how structure (micro and macro) controls the properties. This is followed by a
xv

----- Page 13 (native) -----
description of strength and fracture modes in composites (Chap. 12). This chapter
also describes some salient points of difference, in regard to design, between
conventional and ﬁber composite materials. This is indeed of fundamental impor-
tance in view of the fact that composite materials are not just any other new
material. They represent a total departure from the way we are used to handling
conventional monolithic materials, and, consequently, they require unconventional
approaches to designing with them.
Throughout this book examples are given from practical applications of com-
posites in various ﬁelds. There has been a tremendous increase in applications of
composites in sophisticated engineering items. Modern aircraft industry readily
comes to mind as an ideal example. Boeing Company, for example, has made
widespread use of structural components made of “advanced” composites in 757
and 767 planes. Yet another striking example is that of the Beechcraft Company’s
Starship 1 aircraft. This small aircraft (8–10 passengers plus crew) is primarily
made of carbon and other high-performance ﬁbers in epoxy matrix. The use of
composite materials results in 19% weight reduction compared to an identical
aluminum airframe. Besides this weight reduction, the use of composites made a
new wing design conﬁguration possible, namely, a variable-geometry forward wing
that sweeps forward during takeoff and landing to give stability and sweeps back
30° in level ﬂight to reduce drag. As a bonus, the smooth structure of composite
wings helps to maintain laminar air ﬂow. Readers will get an idea of the tremendous
advances made in the composites ﬁeld if they would just remind themselves that
until about 1975 these materials were being produced mostly on a laboratory scale.
Besides the aerospace industry, chemical, electrical, automobile, and sports
industries are the other big users, in one form or another, of composite materials.
This book has grown out of lectures given over a period of more than a decade to
audiences comprised of senior year undergraduate and graduate students, as well as
practicing engineers from industry. The idea of this book was conceived at Instituto
Militar de Engenharia, Rio de Janeiro. I am grateful to my former colleagues there,
in particular, J.R.C. Guimarães, W.P. Longo, J.C.M. Suarez, and A.J.P. Haiad, for
their stimulating companionship. The book’s major gestation period was at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where C.A. Wert and J.M. Rigsbee
helped me to complete the manuscript. The book is now seeing the light of the day
at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology. I would like to thank my
colleagues there, in particular, O.T. Inal, P. Lessing, M.A. Meyers, A. Miller,
C.J. Popp, and G.R. Purcell, for their cooperation in many ways, tangible and
intangible. An immense debt of gratitude is owed to N.J. Grant of MIT, a true
gentleman and scholar, for his encouragement, corrections, and suggestions as he
read the manuscript. Thanks are also due to R. Signorelli, J. Cornie, and
P.K. Rohatgi for reading portions of the manuscript and for their very constructive
suggestions. I would be remiss in not mentioning the students who took my courses
on composite materials at New Mexico Tech and gave very constructive feedback.
A special mention should be made of C.K. Chang, C.S. Lee, and N. Pehlivanturk
for their relentless queries and discussions. Thanks are also due to my wife,
Nivedita Chawla, and Elizabeth Fraissinet for their diligent word processing; my
