Inactivation of the tumor suppressor p53 by missense mutations is the
most frequent genetic alteration in human cancers. The common
missense mutations in the TP53 gene disrupt the ability of p53 to bind
to DNA and consequently to transactivate downstream genes. How-
ever, it is still not fully understood how a large number of the
remaining mutations affect p53 structure and function. Here, we used
a comprehensive site-directed mutagenesis technique and a yeast-
based functional assay to construct, express, and evaluate 2,314 p53
mutants representing all possible amino acid substitutions caused by
a point mutation throughout the protein (5.9 substitutions per resi-
due), and correlated p53 function with structure- and tumor-derived
mutations. This high-resolution mutation analysis allows evaluation
of previous predictions and hypotheses through interrelation of
function, structure and mutation.
T
he p53 tumor suppressor is a 393-aa transcription factor. In
response to various types of genotoxic stresses, p53 transacti-
vates a number of genes by binding to specific DNA sequences (1),
thereby arresting cell cycle, repairing damaged DNA, or inducing
apoptosis as the cell fates (2). The structure of the p53 core
DNA-binding domain (residues 94–312) that binds directly to the
DNA sequence has been resolved by x-ray crystallography, and both
x-ray crystallography and NMR analysis have been used to deduce
the structure of the tetramerization domain (residues 323–356),
which is needed for optimum function (3–5). The p53 transactivity
is regulated by posttranslational mechanisms such as phosphory-
lation, acetylation, and prolyl isomeration (6–10), or by protein–
protein interaction (11). Through these mechanisms, p53 may select
a subset of target promoters by changing its structure and affinity
to bind to the DNA sequences with variations among the down-
stream genes. However, little is known about the underlying mech-
anism that regulates selectivity of the downstream genes and
resulting cell fate.
Somatic TP53 mutations are the most common (50%) genetic
alteration in human cancer (12), and a large number of TP53
mutations have been assembled in two major TP53 mutation
databases (13, 14). The latest International Agency for Research on
Cancer (IARC) TP53 mutation database contains 17,689 somatic
mutations and 225 germ-line mutations. Among these, 97% of p53
mutations are clustered in the core DNA-binding domain and
75% of the mutations are missense mutations. So far, 1,135
distinct amino acid substitutions caused by missense mutations have
been documented. There is little increase in the number of amino
acid substitutions since 1999, suggesting that almost all types of
naturally occurring pathogenic missense mutations have been al-
ready reported (see Fig. 5, which is published as supporting
information on the PNAS web site, www.pnas.org). Therefore, the
tumor-derived missense mutations may inactivate p53 by affecting
its ability to bind to DNA, and unreported missense mutations
might be nonpathogenic for tumorigenesis. Accordingly, a limited
number of tumor-derived missense mutations have been shown to
be functionally defective, but the majority of the 1,000 distinct
types of amino acid substitutions are still unexamined.
Analysis of tumor-derived missense mutations and previously
unreported missense mutations should advance our understanding
of function–structure and function–mutation relationships, and
thereby pathogenesis of tumor. In this study, we constructed 2,314
distinct p53 mutants that represented all possible amino acid
substitutions caused by a point mutation throughout the protein
(5.9 substitutions per residue) and were evaluated for their trans-
activities for many reporters. We describe here the correlation of
p53 function with structure- and tumor-derived mutations.
Materials and Methods
Site-Directed Mutagenesis. To design oligonucleotide sequences for
site-directed mutagenesis, we first substituted every first, second,
and third nucleotide of all but the first ATG codon of p53 (codons
2–393) by another nucleotide, and then excluded nonsense muta-
tions and silent mutations. When two substitutions encoded the
same amino acid, we chose one of them according to whether the
substitution is more frequently reported than the other(s) or more
frequently used in natural human cDNA (15). According to the
rule, we synthesized 2,314 distinct mutant oligonucleotides with one
base mismatch (see Table 1, which is published as supporting
information on the PNAS web site). The strategy to generate a
mutant p53 cDNA are schematically shown in Fig. 6 and Tables 2
and 3, which are published as supporting information on the PNAS
web site, and explained in the Fig. 6 legend.
Gap Repair Vectors and Yeast Transformation. The basic method of
yeast transformation and gap repair assay was reported (16). Three
different plasmids were used as gap vectors for the construction of
the mutant p53 expression vectors in yeast (see Fig. 7, which is
published as supporting information on the PNAS web site). The
resulting 2,314 yeast transformants (YPH499-derived haploid cells)
were stored at 80°C in 25 96-well plates.
Plasmids. For reporter plasmids in yeast system, we selected eight
p53-binding sequences as transcriptional enhancer elements: two
from human DNA fragments (the p21WAF1 and MDM2 promoters)
and six from synthetic oligonucleotides (p53-binding elements of
BAX, GADD45, 14-3-3, p53AIP1, Noxa, and p53R2) and inserted
each of them into the enhancerless GFP or Ds-Red reporter
plasmid. pAS03G, which contains two p53-responsive elements
(p53RE,
5-GAACATGTCCCAACATGTTG-3
and

AGACTGGGCATGTCTGGGCA-3) and the flanking sequences
of human WAF1 promoter upstream of the GAL1 promoter

(Stratagene). pKS01Rnull plasmid was constructed by inserting the
GAL1 promoter UAS and a fusion sequence of the 5 coding

region of HIS3 (51 bp) and full-length Ds-Red cDNA into pRS323
(18) at the EagI and BamHI sites. pKS05R contains two p53RE
(5-GGTCAAGTTCAGACACGTT-3 and 5-AGTTAAGTC-
CTGACTTGTCT-3) and the flanking sequences of the MDM2
promoter sequence (GenBank accession no. U28935, nucleotides
686–791) at the EagI site of pKS01Rnull. The other pKS plasmids
contain three tandem copies of the p53RE derived from the BAX,
14-3-3, p53AIP1, GADD45, Noxa, and p53R2 genes at the EagI site
of pKS01Rnull, and are called pKS07R, pKS09R, pKS11R,
pKS13R, pKS15R, and pKS17R, respectively. The p53RE se-
quences in the pKS plasmids are as follows: pKS07R, 5-AGA-
CAAGCCTGGGCGTGGGC-3;pKS09R,5-AGGCATGTGCC-
ACCATGCCC-3; pKS11R, 5-TCTCTTGCCCGGGCTTG-

pKS15R, 5-AGGCTTGCCCCGGCAAGTTG-3; and pKS17R,
5-TGACATGCCCAGGCATGTCT-3. These pKS plasmids were
introduced into YPH500 (Stratagene). For p53 expression exper-
iment in human cells, the wild-type p53 expression vector, pCR259-
p53WT, was constructed by inserting a PCR-amplified wild-type
TP53 cDNA into the EcoRIEagI sites of pCR259 (Qbiogene,
Carlsbad, CA). The mutant p53 cDNAs derived from yeast p53
expression vector were extracted by Zymoprep (Zymo Research,
Orange, CA) yeast plasmid mini preparation kit and were amplified
by PCR. The cDNAs were then introduced into EcoRIEagI sites
of the pCR259 plasmid. The mutant p53 expression vectors,
pCR259-p53MT, were identical except for specific single-
nucleotide substitutions in the TP53 cDNA. Luciferase reporter
plasmids p21Ps-luc, pMDMPs-luc, pBAXPs-luc, and pSIGMAPs-
luc for luciferase assay were described (17). Luciferase reporter
plasmids p53R2Ps-luc and p53GADD45Ps-luc were constructed by
inserting a 630-bp PCR fragment derived from p53R2 intron 1
(GenBank accession no. AP002907, nucleotides 58131–58761) and
a 333-bp PCR fragment derived from GADD45 intron 3 (GenBank
accession no. L24498, nucleotides 3645–3978), respectively, into an
EcoRI site of pGL3E (17).
DNA Sequencing. The mutant p53 cDNA were amplified from yeast
cells or p53 expression plasmids by PCR and were sequenced by
using a DTCS DNA sequencing kit (Beckman Coulter) and an
automated CEQ2000EX DNA sequencer (Beckman Coulter). The
primers for DNA sequencing were shown in Table 4, which is
published as supporting information on the PNAS web site.
Mating Assay. The 2,314 p53-expressing YPH499 (MATa) strains
were inoculated from the frozen stock onto the surface of synthetic
complete (SC) solid medium lacking leucine and tryptophan with
autoclaved 96-pin replicators (Incyte Genomics) and were grown at
30°C for 2 days. YPH500 (MAT) strain, harboring each of the
Ds-Red reporter plasmids was spread on the surface of yeast
extractpeptonedextrose (YPD) plates and grown at 30°C for 12 h.
The p53-expressing YPH499 strains were then mated on the lawn
of the YPH500-spread YPD plates with the autoclaved 96-pin
replicators and further incubated at 30°C for 24 h. The mating cells
were selected by touching the surface of the YPD plates with the
tip of the replicators and inoculated on SC solid medium lacking
leucine, tryptophan, and histidine. After incubation at 30°C for 1 or
2 days, the selected diploid (mating type a) cells were inoculated
on the fresh medium.
Fluorescence Intensity. The yeast clones were replicated on the
selective SC solid media and were grown at 37°C for 2 days. The
plates were then directly processed to a 96-well formatted Fluo-
roskan Ascent FL fluorometer (Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland) to
measure their fluorescence intensity (excitation: 485 nm, emission:
538 nm) for p53-dependent enhanced green fluorescent protein
(EGFP) expression through the human p21WAF1-derived p53-
binding sequence, and the fluorescence intensity (excitation: 544
nm, emission: 590 nm) for Ds-Red through other p53-binding
sequences. At least two independent experiments were performed
for each reporter and the fluorescence intensities were averaged.
The averaged values were standardized for each p53-binding se-
quence, clustered, and visualized with the CLUSTER and TREEVIEW
programs.
Luciferase Assay. Saos-2 cells were cultured in 96-well assay plates
(Corning) in RPMI medium 1640 with 10% FCS at 37°C. When the
cells reached at 60-90% confluence, pCR259-p53WT or
pCR259-p53MT (12.5–50 ng), and one of the six luciferase reporter
plasmids (50–87.5 ng), were cotransfected into the cells by using an
Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). After 24 h,
luciferase activity was assayed by using a Steady-Glo luciferase assay
system (Promega) and was measured by a Fluoroskan Ascent FL
fluorometer. Six experimental values of the luciferase activities for
the p53 mutants were compared with that of wild-type p53 and the
statistical significance (P  0.001) was examined by paired t test.
Susceptibility Scores. p53 mutants (2,314) were fractionated into
p53 structural categories including domains, secondary structures,
evolutionary amino acid conservation, DNA contact, and Zn
binding, yielding the following three sets of susceptibility scores (i)
for function. The ratio of the number of functionally inactive p53
mutants to the number of constructed mutants in each structural
category was calculated for each promoter. If all p53 mutants in a
structural category have no transactivity, the category is scored as
1. If all p53 mutants in a structural category have transactivity, the
category is scored as 0; (ii) for somatic mutation. The ratio of the
number of reported somatic mutants in the IARC database to
the number of constructed p53 mutants in each structural category
was calculated for each promoter. If none of the p53 mutants in a
structural category have been listed in the database, the category is
scored as 0. If all of the p53 mutants in a structural category have
been listed, the category is scored as 1; and (iii) for mutation
frequency. The ratio of the frequency of the amino acid substitution
in the IARC somatic mutation database to the number of con-
structed p53 mutants in each structural category was calculated for
each promoter. If the total frequency of the amino acid substitution
in a structural category is 100, and the number of constructed
mutants in the category is 20, the category is scored as 5. The data
were summarized in Table 5, which is published as supporting
information on the PNAS web site, and the standardized values
were visualized with the CLUSTER and TREEVIEW programs.
Drawing of p53 Peptide Structures. To draw the p53 core domain and
oligomerization domain, we downloaded the two National Center
for Biotechnology Information structure files 1TUP and 3SAK.
These files were customized for our purpose and visualized with
CN3D software (19) or the SWISS-PDB VIEWER (20).
Results and Discussion
Construction of 2,314 Distinct p53 Missense Mutations. Based on a
combination of a PCR-mediated megaprimer method and a yeast-
based gap repair assay (see Materials and Methods and Figs. 6 and
7), we constructed 2,314 p53 mutants. This result was achieved by
synthesizing 2,314 distinct oligonucleotides, each of which consisted
of 26 nucleotides with one base mismatch at the 14th nucleotide
from the 5 end, which were distributed into 25 96-well microtiter
plates (Fig. 1a). Full-length TP53 cDNAs with each missense
mutation were then generated by two-step PCRs in the 96-well
format with wild-type TP53 cDNA templates. Each of the muta-
tions was constructed into a gap p53-expressing vector by homol-
ogous recombination in vivo in a yeast strain harboring a p53-
responsive p21WAF1 reporter plasmid. We confirmed appropriate
incorporation of missense mutations by direct DNA sequencing of
all TP53 cDNAs and expression of the p53 protein. The resulting
mutation library consists of 2,314 yeast clones containing distinct
TP53 cDNAs with point mutations covering all possible amino acid

substitutions caused by single-nucleotide substitutions throughout
the full length of the TP53 ORF, except for the translation initiation
ATG codon. The yeast clones expresses a corresponding mutant
p53 protein under the control of the constitutive yeast ADH1
promoter. The library provides an average of 5.9 substitutions in
each residue, and covers 95% of the tumor-derived p53 amino
acid substitutions listed in the IARC database, as well as a large
number of previously unreported substitutions.
Evaluation of 2,314 Missense Mutations on Sequence-Specific Trans-
activation. To evaluate the effect of each mutant on p53 function,
the ability of the expressed mutant p53 to transactivate the EGFP
reporter plasmid through the p53 binding sequence (p53BS) de-
rived from the p21WAF1 promoter was quantitatively measured by
the fluorescence intensity of EGFP, and mapped onto the p53
primary structure (Fig. 1b). Overall, one-third (36.0%) of the p53
mutants were functionally inactive. Approximately two-thirds
(64.0%) of the mutants in the core domain of p53 were inactive,
whereas activity was mostly unaffected by both NH2- and COOH-
terminal mutations, except for a significant number of inactivating
mutations within the tetramerization domain. The data clearly show
marked differences in sensitivity to amino acid substitutions among
the three p53 domains (see also Table 5) and support the previous
speculation that both the NH2 and COOH termini are insensitive
to amino acid substitutions. Combined the data with our single-
nucleotide substitution model (see Fig. 8, which is published as
supporting information on the PNAS web site), we conclude that
this is the major reason why tumor-derived TP53 missense muta-
tions are clustered within the DNA-binding domain and rarely
observed in the NH2 and COOH termini. There were clear limits
between residues 95 and 96 and between residues 286 and 287 (Fig.
1 b and c). This functionally defined DNA-binding domain (residues
96–286) corresponds well to the proteolysis-resistant and structur-
ally compact core domain (subtilisin fragment, residues 102–292;
thermolysin fragment, residues 92–30; refs 21 and 22).
When the transcriptional transactivities of the p53 mutants were
fractionated (Fig. 1d), there were at least three subtypes: mutants
with no activity (type N: 9.6%), mutants with significantly reduced
but some residual activity (type R: 26.5%), and mutants with
activity comparable with that of wild-type p53 (type W: 63.9%). The
transactivities of the mutants for other p53BSs derived from
MDM2, BAX, 14-3-3, p53AIP1, GADD45, Noxa, and p53R2 pro-
moters were also determined quantitatively from the Ds-Red
fluorescence intensity of diploid yeast clones obtained by mating
the p53-expressing haploid cells with another haploid cell line
harboring one of the Ds-Red reporter plasmids (Fig. 1a). The values
for each p53BS were standardized and mapped onto the p53
primary structure (Fig. 1c). The results were similar to those with
the p21WAF1 promoter. Overall, about one-third (19–41%, depend-
ing on the p53BS) of the p53 mutants were functionally inactive.
The Function–Structure and Function–Mutation Relationships. To gain
an insight into the relationships among p53 function, protein
structure, and mutation, the 2,314 missense mutants plus p53 null
and wild-type p53 controls were clustered by unsupervised two-
dimensional analysis (Fig. 2a). The transactivities of the p53 mu-
tants were divided into two large clusters: the first cluster contained

p53 protein with an amino acid substitution corresponding to the original point
mutation and also expressed EGFP, depending on the ability to transactivate
through the p53BS of the human p21WAF1 promoter. The p53-expressing haploid
cells were mated with other haploid cells (MAT) harboring a Ds-Red reporter
plasmid with a p53BS other than the p21WAF1 promoter. (b) Schematic map of the

wild-type p53 and the mutants with functional activity for all or
most of the promoters (56.3%), and the second cluster contained
p53-null clones and the mutants lacking functional activity for all or
most of the promoters (43.7%). Background information related to
p53 structural features (residues in core domain, secondary struc-
ture, highly conserved regions, DNA-contact, and Zn-binding) and
the IARC database (tumor-related germ-line mutations, somatic
mutations, and their frequencies) for each amino acid substitution
was then correlated to the clusters (Fig. 2b). Clearly, these structural
features and the IARC information tend to concentrate in the
second cluster, whereas C-to-G transition mutations at CpG sites,
unrelated to p53 structure and function, show no such tendency.
These results indicate a strong correlation of the p53 transactivation
function with p53 structure- and tumor-related mutations.
To confirm the correlation of p53 structure with function and
tumor-related mutations, susceptibility for the p53 transactivity,
somatic mutation, or mutation frequency in each p53BS was
calculated for the several structural categories (see Materials and
Methods and Table 5) and the standardized values were visualized
in Fig. 2c. The DNA-binding domain is clearly more susceptible to
inactivation by amino acid substitution than are the NH2- and
COOH-terminal domains. Within the DNA-binding domain, the
secondary structures (the two -helices or the 11 -strands) were
more susceptible to amino acid substitution than were the loops
(L1–3 and other short loops) connecting -helix and -strand or
two -strands. The four evolutionarily conserved regions are more
susceptible than the nonconserved regions. Among the regions,
regions IV and V, which are spatially close to DNA (Fig. 2d) are
more susceptible than regions II and III, which are supportive
structures for p53 binding to DNA. Furthermore, approximately
half of the mutants in regions IV and V were type N, whereas most
of the mutants in regions II and III were type R or type W (see
above). DNA-contact residues and Zn-binding residues showed the
strongest susceptibility among the categories. Overall patterns of
the susceptibility scores for p53 function were similar among the
distinct p53BSs, as were the susceptibility scores for IARC somatic
mutation. These results indicate a strong correlation of p53 struc-
ture with transactivation function and with tumor-related muta-
tions, and also an interrelation between p53 function and mutation.
The cluster analysis divided the eight p53BSs into three subgroups.
The first group (MDM2, p21WAF1, and BAX) was most similar to the
susceptibility for mutation frequency. The second group (GADD45,

p53AIP1, and 14-3-3) was also similar to the first, but showed
higher susceptibility in Zn-binding residues. The third group (p53R2
and Noxa) was less similar to the second and showed lower
susceptibility in region III. The difference in the similarities among
the subgroups might mean the different contributions of the
downstream genes for tumor suppression, although there are no
supportive evidences at present. The average transactivities of the
p53 mutants for the p21WAF1 promoter were mapped in the 3D
structure of the p53 DNA-binding domain (Fig. 2d).
Function–Structure Relationship in the Tetramerization Domain of
p53. Function–structure relationship was also investigated in the
COOH-terminal portion of p53. Specific residues in the -helix and
-strand of the tetramerization domain were sensitive to inactiva-
tion by amino acid substitutions (Fig. 3a). These 15 residues are
Phe-328, Leu-330, Ile-332, and Arg-333 in the -strand, Gly-334 in
a turn, and Arg-337, Phe-338, Phe-341, Arg-342, Leu-344, Asn-345,
Ala-347, Leu-348, Leu-350, and Lys-351 in the -helix. Leu-330,
Ile-332, Gly-334, Arg-337, Phe-341, Leu-344, and Ala-347, espe-
cially, were highly susceptible to functional inactivation because
they were inactivated by at least three distinct substitutions. Sub-
stitution of the hydrophobic residues (Phe, Leu, Ile, or Ala) that
form a hydrophobic core in the domain (5) by nonhydrophobic
residues or by structure-destroying proline tends to inactivate p53
function (data not shown). Among the charged residues (Arg or
Lys), Arg-337 was highly sensitive, and any of six substitutions were
functionally defective. When these residues were mapped on the 3D
structure of this domain (Fig. 3 b–d), it became clear that many of
these residues locate spatially face-to-face and seem to be involved
in monomer–monomer interaction to form a dimer through
-strand–-strand and -helix–-helix interactions, and in dimer–
dimer interactions to form a tetramer through an -helix–-helix
interaction. Our data clearly underscore the structure-based studies
predicting the functional importance of these residues (5, 23) and
the significance of tetramer formation for p53 transactivation.
Combined with the data for the core structure described above, our
study supports a strong interrelation between p53 function and
structure in the two structural domains.
Classification and Interpretation of the Clustered Mutations. Among
the 2,314 p53 mutants, 1,266 (54.7%) of them were easy explainable
by the function–mutation hypothesis: 905 mutants (39.1%) showed
intact transactivity on all eight promoters and have never been
reported in tumors, whereas 361 mutants (15.6%) showed inactive
transactivity on all of the eight promoters and have been reported
at least once in tumors. There are three types of exceptions. First,
373 mutants (16.1%) have been reported in tumors at least once,
even though the mutants retained wild-type activity on all promot-

cells. (a) Transactivities of three representative p53 mutants (R175H, P177H, and
M243V) through the indicated six p53-binding sequences were shown as relative
GFP (EGFP or Ds-Red) intensities against wild-type (WT) p53 activities. (b) The

was averaged in each fraction.

ers. There are several possible explanations. (i) Such mutants are
functionally silent but were accidentally expanded during clonal
selection of tumor cells. In fact, there are many examples where
tumors with such mutants also contain additional inactivating
mutations (data not shown). (ii) There might be a minor tumor-
suppressive p53 function unrelated directly to transactivity, and
such mutants disrupt this function. (iii) There might be unexamined
downstream genes unable to be transactivated by the mutants.
Second, 39 mutants (1.7%) have never been reported in tumors
although the mutants were inactive on all promoters. We speculate
that the mutants are pathogenic but genetically infrequent, and that
they were not detected because most of them are located in the
NH2- or COOH-terminal portions, which have not been widely
examined (13).
Finally, the remaining 635 mutants (27.5%) were inactive only for
a limited number of promoter(s) (see Table 6, which is published
as supporting information on the PNAS web site). These types of
mutants are valuable for studying the possible relationship between
promoter selectivity and tumorigenesis. To examine whether the
promoter selectivity in yeast is analogous in human cells, we
expressed some of the partially inactive mutants (P177H and
M243V) as well as completely inactive R175H mutant in human
osteosarcoma cell line, Saos-2 cells, and compared their ability to
transactivate luciferase reporter gene through six distinct promoters
with that in the yeast reporter system (Fig. 4 a and b). In both P177H
and M243V mutants, spectra of transactivities were similar between
the two cell systems although transactivities for the MDM2 and the
WAF1 promoters were more sensitive in yeast than that in human
tumor cells. In addition, S121F mutant, that fails to transactivate
MDM2 and induce apoptosis better than wild-type p53 in human
tumor cells (24), selectively lost transactivity for MDM2 in yeast
(data not shown).
Because the average mutation frequency depends on the number
of inactive promoters, even if C-to-T transitions at CpG sites, which
introduce a considerable bias unrelated to function, are excluded
(Fig. 4c), these mutants are likely to have partial function in tumor
suppression. Similar results were observed in the human cell system
with a limited number of mutants (Fig. 4d). There was no corre-
lation between the transactivity for a specific promoter and the
mutation frequency in both yeast and human cells (data not shown).
From these observations, we predict that a wide range of activity
against various types of downstream genes, rather than a limited
range of activity against a specific downstream gene(s), is necessary
for the full tumor-suppressive function of p53; this could be the
major reason why TP53 mutations are frequently found in the p53
pathway, yet mutations in p53 downstream genes are rarely found
in tumors (see Fig. 9, which is published as supporting information
on the PNAS web site). These results also support the hypothesis
that p53 acts at a critical nodal point between upstream modulators
and downstream effectors (25). During the study, we have mu-
tagenized each of the known phosphorylation sites at Ser and Thr
residues, acetylation sites at Lys residues as well as prolyl isomerase
sites at Ser-Pro and at Thr-Pro motifs in the NH2 or COOH
terminus. However any of these residues were basically not sensitive
by single amino acid substitutions because almost all of the mutants
did not lead to significant reduction of the p53 transactivities.
This result is not surprising because the previous studies have
shown that multiple mutations are necessary to inactivate p53
transactivity (8–10, 26).
Conclusion
A key finding of our study is that high-resolution mutation analysis
over the full length of a protein provides a precise map of
functionally susceptible as well as mutation-susceptible residues. In
the future, additions to the map of clinical information such as
response to chemotherapy and prognostic factors may permit
mutation-specific prediction of clinical outcomes on a functional
basis. Furthermore, the high-resolution p53 mutant library allows
the isolation of a number of temperature-sensitive mutants and
intragenic suppressor mutants (data not shown) that reactivate the
function of p53 by permissive temperatures or second-site muta-
tions, and may also provide mutants with enhanced ability to induce
apoptosis andor cell-cycle arrest compared with wild-type p53.
Such specific mutants may be useful in investigation of p53-targeted
molecular therapeutics (27).
A second key finding is that this high-resolution missense mu-
tation analysis has advanced our understanding of the interrelation
among p53 structure, function, and tumor-derived mutations. Our
results support the view that, among the endogenous and exogenous
mechanisms of mutation of the TP53 gene (28), inactivation of p53
function is the most important factor in the spectrum of TP53
mutation and that sequence-specific transactivation is the critical
function in p53-dependent tumor suppression. Therefore, we pro-
pose that the strategy described here can provide insights into
the function–structure and function–mutation relationships of a
disease-associated protein, as well as a better understanding of the
role of the gene product in structural and functional genetics and
in molecular pathogenesis and epidemiology.
