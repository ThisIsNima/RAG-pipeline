Physical activity in older people: a systematic
review
Fei Sun1, Ian J Norman2 and Alison E While2*
Abstract
Background: Physical activity (PA) in older people is critically important in the prevention of disease, maintenance
of independence and improvement of quality of life. Little is known about the physical activity of the older adults
or their compliance with current physical activity guidelines.
Methods: A systematic literature search of the published literature was conducted. Included were published reports
of original research that independently reported: the PA level of non-institutional older adults (aged 60 years and
over); and the proportion of older adults in the different samples who met PA recommendations or guidelines. The
review was restricted to studies published since 2000 to provide a current picture of older adults’ PA levels.
Results: Fifty three papers were included in the review. The percentage of older adults meeting recommended
physical activity ranged from 2.4 – 83.0% across the studies. Definitions of “recommended” physical activity in older
adults varied across the studies as did approaches to measurement which posed methodological challenges to
data analysis. Older age groups were less likely than the reference group to be regularly active, and women were
less likely than men to achieve regular physical activity, especially leisure time physical activity, when measured by
both subjective and objective criteria.
Conclusion: The review highlights the need for studies which recruit representative random samples of community
based older people and employ validated measurement methods consistently to enable comparison of PA levels
over time and between countries.
Keywords: Physical activity, Exercise, Older people, Older adults
Background
Regular physical activity (PA) can bring significant health
benefits to people of all ages and the need for PA does
not end in later life with evidence increasingly indicating
that PA can extend years of active independent living,
reduce disability and improve the quality of life for older
people [1]. Indeed a large scale longitudinal 8 year study
found that every additional 15 minutes of daily PA up to
100 minutes per day resulted in a further 4% decrease in
mortality from any cause [2]. Increasing PA will help
minimise the burden on health and social care through
enabling healthy ageing [3,4].
There is no known review of PA among older people
and it is not known whether active older people comply
with recommended PA levels. Understanding the extent
of PA will provide a global perspective of PA among
older people within the context of an increasing desire
to promote PA goals across all age groups. The aim of
this review was to establish global levels of PA among
older people as reported in the published literature.
Establishing PA prevalence in older community dwelling
people provides a baseline against which changes in PA
can be measured, international comparisons drawn and
the success or otherwise of public health interventions
to increase PA evaluated.
Methods
Search strategy
The following methods were used to locate relevant pub-
lished studies from January 2000 – 11 April 2011. Elec-
tronic searches of computerized databases were carried
out on English language databases (The Cochrane Library,
PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO,

tabases: Chinese Biomedical, VIP Chinese Science Journals
and WANFANG DATA. Keyword combinations for elec-
tronic database searches are listed in Table 1. The search
was limited to the English and Chinese languages.
Selection criteria
Papers were reviewed if they met the following criteria:
(1) original research; (2) independently reported the PA
level of non-institutional older people (adults aged 60
years and over); (3) reported the proportion of any of PA
recommendation or guidelines achieved by the sample.
No attempt was made to access unpublished studies or
other ‘grey’ literature. The study selection process is set
out in Figure 1.
Data extraction and appraisal
All authors devised the research strategy. Initial screen-
ing was undertaken by one researcher (FS) and then
checked by another (AEW). Disagreements about inclu-
sion were discussed until agreement was reached. One
researcher (FS) extracted the following data from the se-
lected studies: country of study, study sample, measure-
ments, recommendations and main results. Another
researcher (AEW) verified the extracted data and made
corrections where necessary. Disagreements were re-
solved by reference to the third researcher (IJN). All
three researchers contributed to the synthesis of the
data.
PA recommendations or guidelines
Definitions of “recommended” PA in older adults varied
across the studies with some studies employing two or
more guidelines. These guidelines are summarized in
Table 2. The minimum recommended PA level in the
guidelines in most studies was 150 minutes of moderate
or vigorous PA per week and we adopted this standard
as the desired PA level for the purpose of this review.
We categorised the selected studies according to their
underpinning PA guidelines, and identified studies as
falling into one of two groups according to the detail
provided
by
the
study
authors
on
the
guidelines
followed. Twenty six studies which stated only the total
amount of PA per week were classified within the ‘less
detailed guideline group’. Studies which stated the
weekly frequency and daily dosage towards the total
amount of weekly PA were classified as being in the
‘detailed guideline group’. According to the Physical Ac-
tivity Guideline Advisory Committee’s report [5], de-
tailed guidelines, such as 1995 CDC/ACSM guideline is
too specific. In other words, the existing scientific evi-
dence cannot distinguish the health benefits of 30 mi-
nutes of PA on 5 days a week from those gained through
50 minutes of PA on 3 days a week.
Results and discussion
An overview of selected papers
A total of 53 papers met the inclusion criteria. The main
findings of the selected studies are reported in Tables 3
and 4.
Most of the studies were conducted in the United
States and Australia (USA n=19; Australia n=10; UK
n=5; Brazil n=4; China n=4; Canada n=4; New Zealand
n=1; Colombia n=1; South Africa n=1; Greece and
Cyprus n=1; Cyprus n=1; Sweden n=1; Switzerland n=1).
Forty nine papers reported cross-sectional studies and
four reported longitudinal studies. The sample sizes
ranged from 54 – 43,259. The number of studies
conducted each year over the search period was not con-
stant (1990–1994, n=2; 1995–1999, n=12; 2000–2004,
n=32; 2005–2009, n=18; 2010–2011, n=2) with more
than half being conducted between 2000 and 2004.
Forty seven studies measured PA intensity, duration,
and frequency using subjective measures (interview or
self-reported questionnaires) and six reported objective
data gathered using an accelerometer. Two studies com-
pared
subjective
and
objective
data
measurements.
While 39 studies recorded PA taken in periods of 10 mi-
nutes or more, other studies recorded all PA.
Physical activity comprises leisure-time PA, occupa-
tional PA, household PA and transportation PA. Leisure-
time
PA
(LTPA)
was
most
often
measured
and
compared to the criterion for meeting PA recommenda-
tions. However, occupational, household and transporta-
tion PA were gathered in some studies. PA volume was
calculated differently across the studies including: total
metabolic equivalents (METs), minutes of weekly PA;
minutes of participation in and frequency of PA during
the week; kilocalories expended per kilogram of weight
per day; and time in moderate to vigorous PA from ac-
celerometers. To calculate minutes of weekly moderate
to vigorous PA, some authors summed the duration of
moderate and vigorous PA (MPA+VPA) while others
doubled the time of vigorous PA because of its higher

intensity (MPA+2VPA). The definition of moderate and
vigorous PA also varied across the studies. For instance,
the minimum cut off of moderate PA varied from 3
MET, 3.3 MET to 4 MET across the studies. Given the
variety of methods of data collection and calculation of
PA level, a meta-analysis was not attempted.
Levels of PA within recommendations or guidelines
Thirty two studies adopted the more detailed PA guide-
lines while 26 studies were in the less detailed group
with some studies employing two or more guidelines.
Although most of the PA guidelines stated the total PA
amount which should be accumulated in bouts of at

least 10 minutes, 14 of the 53 studies recorded all mod-
erate or vigorous PA (see Table 2).
General PA prevalence in older adults
Tables 3 and 4 present a synopsis of the findings relating
to older people’s PA levels from each country. Across
the 53 papers, the percentage of older adults meeting
the guidelines ranged from 2.4% [55] to 83% [49] with
most studies reporting that 20-60% of the samples met
the guideline. When LTPA was measured, 20 studies ex-
cluded household work with reported PA prevalence
ranging from 6.23% [58] to 67.51 % [27], while 14 in-
cluded household work with reported PA prevalence of
10.86% [31] to 66.7% [16]. Seventeen studies measured
all domains of PA (including occupational, household,
transportation and recreational PA) with reported PA
prevalence of 11.67% [31] to 77.22% [51], and two stud-
ies reported that 31.7% [13] and 62.4% [45] of older
people achieved sufficient PA through walking. In six pa-
pers PA prevalence was reported by age group, gender
group, or residential area group (rural versus urban), but
not for the sample overall.
Self-reported PA
In 48 subjectively measured PA studies, 29 studies
adopted the more detailed PA guidelines and 21 studies
adopted the less detailed PA guidelines (5 studies
adopted 2 criteria). Studies that employed the more de-
tailed guidelines reported PA prevalence ranging from
6.2% in the Health Survey for England [38] to 82.6% in
an urban Chinese sample [47]. Using the less detailed
guidelines (criteria), sufficient PA in the other studies in-
creased from 21.3 % [34] to 83.0% [49] in a small older
female sample.
Those studies that accumulated PA data by 10 minutes
bouts reported a relatively lower PA prevalence. The two
studies which only included PA data of more than 30
minute sessions reported the lowest PA prevalence
(10.9% [30]; 6.23% [58]) across all the subjectively mea-
sured PA studies.
Objectively measured PA
Six studies used accelerometers and reported extractable
data (i.e. proportion of the sample meeting the criterion of
sufficient PA rather than measures of central tendency).

1 CDC-ACSM 1995: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Sports Medicine 1995 PA Recommendation states that “Every U.S.
adult should accumulate 30 minutes or more of moderate-intensity PA on most, preferably all, days of the week”. The cut point of ≥150 min, and 5 times weekly,
was treated as the same criterion.
2 HP 2010: Healthy people 2010, recommended levels of activity are 30 minutes of moderate activity on at least five days a week or 20 minutes or vigorous
activity three times a week.
3 CPAG recommendation: It recommends 60 min of light activity daily, 30 to 60 min of moderate activity 4 days a week, or 20 to 30 min of vigorous activity 4
days a week. We choose the combination of moderate and vigorous PA.
4 3.0 KKD: Canada National PA goal (Canadian Fitness and Lifestyle Research Institute 2005): Energy expenditure >1.5 KKD has been used to categorize those who
are at least moderately active and who, thus, meet national physical activity goals. We adopted 3.0 KKD (active threshold, 1.5 KKD is moderate active threshold) so
that it is comparable to the other guidelines. (KKD, kilocalories per kilogram per day).
5 500 METs: modified SGR that only includes the energy expenditure component, i.e., 500 METs per week.
6 SGR 1996: modified from US Surgeon General’s Report recommendation, demands a weekly amount of PA as approximately 1000 kcal·wk-1 (or 150 kcal/day).
7 PAGA 2008 (2008 PA Guidelines for Americans): adults should participate weekly in at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity, 75 minutes of
vigorous-intensity aerobic activity, or an equivalent combination. This is the same criterion used in the recommendation from WHO, UK, and Canada’s Physical
Activity Guide for Healthy Active Living.
8 150 minutes/week: modified PAGA 2008 that only includes 150 minutes PA per week.
Y9PA amount was accumulated by 10 minute bouts.

The actigraph accelerometer was used in five studies and
Actical in one study. When measured against the less de-
tailed guidelines, the lowest prevalence (1.84%) was
reported by Davis and Fox [3] based on an European sam-
ple and the highest was 17.2% from a US national survey,
NHANES 2005–2006 [43]. Applying the more detailed
guidelines, Davis and Fox [3] found nobody achieved suffi-
cient PA and Colley [57] reported the highest proportion
of 4.5% in this group with the exception of Hurtig-
Wennlof et al.’s [51] exceptional finding of 87.04%.
However, there was a difference between the studies
using self-report compared to the objective measure-
ment of PA. In our review, two studies compared the
subjective and objective data. Tucker et al.’s [43] analysis
of the NHANES 2005–2006 data found that the suffi-
ciently active group proportion defined by accelerometer
measurement was 7.25% and 17.24% (using different
guidelines); this increased to 54.2% when measured by
questionnaire. Hurtig-Wennlof et al.’s Swedish study
[51] reported a 87.04% objectively measured PA preva-
lence which was higher than the self-reported IPAQ data
of 72.2%.
Gender differences in PA
Twenty two studies reported the recommended PA
prevalence in males and females separately. In general,
men’s PA levels were higher than women’s. In the self-
reported data, gender differences of PA ranged from
0.8% [30] to 21.4% [15], while the differences measured
by accerlerometer were significantly lower (0.2% and
1.5%). However, we noticed that in the self-reported total
PA, increased participation in PA by women exceeded
that of men in three studies [40,53].
Residential differences in PA
Two Chinese papers reported the PA prevalence by place
of residence and reported different results. Muntner et al.
[22] reported sufficient all domain PA prevalence among
52.7% of their rural and 9.8% of their urban older people
samples using the US CDC 1995 criterion from the
InterASIAN Study. However, Xu et al. [47] reported that
Guangdong province urban residents were more active
than rural residents, with 82.6% of the urban and 60.9% of
the rural samples attaining the HP 2010 goals measured
by GPAQ.
PA prevalence across age groups
Eighteen studies measured PA subjectively and two stud-
ies measured PA objectively across different age groups,
however, the majority divided the samples into two age
groups and reported that the older old were more seden-
tary than the younger old. Only five studies divided the
group by relatively narrow age bands. Patterns of partici-
pation in PA decreased progressively with age for both
men and women although there was variation across the
studies. In McGuire et al.’s study [36] PA declined from
23.0% in the 65–69 year group to 13.6% in 85+ year
group but in Mummery et al.’s study [35], the difference
between the 60–64 year group and 80+ year group was
24.2%. There was an unexpected rise in the 70–74 year
age group in the Sims et al.’s [42] study although the
general trends decreased with age. Although Hamdorf
et al. [12] did not report the detailed percentage for each
age group, we can see the same gradually declining trend
from 50.8% in the 60–64 year age group to 15.4% in 85+
year age group in Figure 2.
PA prevalence trends over time
A crucial aspect of investigating trends over time is the
comparability of methods. Differences in instruments,
cut-off points, PA definitions and domains of activity in-
vestigated posed significant challenges to our review. Al-
though nine studies reported the results of the BRFSS,
not all the studies included national representative sam-
ples making it difficult to assess trends. Therefore, we
only included the results of longitudinal studies or the
findings from the same surveillance evaluated by the
same criterion to establish the trend from seven studies.
In Australia between 1990–2000 the proportion LTPA of
older people aged 60 years and over meeting the PA
guideline decreased from 28% to 25.8% in Merom et al.’s
report [13] while the NSW Population Health Survey
[11] detected a small rise in the 65 + year age group
from 36.2% in 1998 to 39.8% in 2005 with a dip to 34.0%
in 2003. The trend of regular walking [13] was similar to
Chau et al.’s [11] report. The USCDC compared the
BRFSS data in 2001 and 2005 and reported that the US’
older population was more active, with a rising preva-
lence of 43.1% to 44.5% in men and 32.2% to 36.3% in
women [21]. Another paper using the BRFSS 2001 and
BRFSS 2007 reported the same overall trend from 37.5%
to 39.3% [48]. Conversely, Knuth et al. [26] reported a
clear drop in PA prevalence between 2002 and 2007 in
Brazil. In 2002, the proportions of older people reaching
the PAGA 2008 guideline were 56.2% and 35.3% in the
60–69 year and 70+ year age groups respectively and de-
creased to 42.7% and 23.7% in 2007.
Discussion
Demographic differences in PA prevalence
One of the challenges facing the development of disease
prevention programmes is the lack of reliable data for
PA levels and trends [59] and the data for PA levels in
older people is no exception. Generally within the in-
cluded studies, the older old age groups were less likely
than those of younger age to be regularly active, and
women were less likely than men to achieve regular PA,
especially in LTPA across both the subjectively and

objectively measured PA studies regardless of the PA
guidelines adopted. The decline in PA with age may be
the most consistent finding in PA epidemiology [60,61]
with the higher PA prevalence among males echoing the
findings of previous studies [62] which may reflect in-
creasing disability with age and cultural norms across
the genders. However, one Australian study [42] found
that the decline of LTPA across the age groups was not
consistent with LTPA peaking in the 70–74 year group.
Additionally three studies reported that women were
more active than men in relation to total PA [25,40,53].
This pattern also appeared in other studies [63] which
may reflect the inclusion of household activities and
other non-leisure, non-sport activities [53] in the total
PA, which, in many cases, are largely specific to women.
However, this was not a consistent finding across the
included studies regardless of the guidelines category, in-
dicating the need to quantify household activities accur-
ately to enable comparisons across genders.
PA trends by country and over time
In our review, there was a slightly increasing trend to-
wards recommended PA levels in older people in Australia
and the US over the last 10 years but a decrease in Brazil.
Studies of time trends in PA have been conducted mostly
in developed countries and their results indicate that
LTPA levels appear to be increasing [31,34,64,65]. Never-
theless, the data indicate that substantial numbers of older
adults do not engage in sufficient PA to promote their
health and there is considerable variation in the levels of
PA reported across countries. Further, we found little data
on time trends in PA in developing countries which was
echoed in a recent systematic review [66]. However, the
decline in PA in Brazil [26] is perhaps indicative of
changes in occupational PA with the emergence of in-
creasing sedentary work in developing countries which
will present a future public health challenge especially
when combined with dietary changes. Similarly Hallal
et al. have also highlighted the lower proportions of adults
who are physically active in south east Asia [59].
The difference between objectively and subjectively
measured PA prevalence
The only two studies comparing self-reported PA to ac-
celerometer measured PA in our review yielded contra-
dictory results [43,51] with Tucker et al.’s [43] findings
being consistent with the majority of other similar stud-
ies [67]. It is likely that the subjective PA studies reflect
social desirability, recall bias and that there is underesti-
mation of PA using objective measurement; PA monitors
are worn typically on the hip which means that they do
not accurately assess upper body activities or account
for movements that require extra effort, such as walking
uphill or carrying loads. Hurtig-Wennlof et al.’s [51]
contradictory findings were probably caused by the
lower cut-off point of MPA at 760 counts per minute
(contrasting with about 2000 counts/min in the other
studies) and the inclusion of PA under 10 minute bouts.
This highlights the need for well designed studies using
objectively measured PA to generate the evidence base
for public health initiatives.
Review limitations
Limitations of this review arise from the discrepancies
and inconsistencies in instrumentation, PA type mea-
sured, guidelines or recommendations adopted by differ-
ent researchers, algorithms, sample frames and other
confounding factors. These made it difficult to make full
use of the extracted data and impossible to compare the
PA prevalence between different regions/countries or as-
sess PA trends with certainty.
Conclusion
Dramatic global population ageing has brought new de-
mands to improve older people’s health by adding “quality”
to their extended lives [68]. The review was undertaken

against the background of the WHO recommendations on
PA for adults aged 65 years and older [69]. Despite these
recommendations physical inactivity is an increasing global
health burden [70] with PA surveillance emerging as
one of the priorities of global public health for the develop-
ment of effective non-communicable disease prevention
programmes [59]. International efforts to increase PA have
been reported within the adult or youth populations
[38,66,71-73]. However, PA levels of older adults have
attracted less interest so there are limited data regarding
the prevalence of various types of PA in older adults and
the proportion of older people whose PA meets PA guide-
lines. This review is the first of its kind and revealed many
methodological challenges to data analysis across the se-
lected studies. Robust studies which recruit representative
random samples and consistently employ validated meas-
urement instruments are needed to enable comparisons in
PA levels to be drawn over time and between countries.
More evidence of PA levels amongst older people is needed
to inform public health strategies which could extend the
health and quality of life of people into old age.
