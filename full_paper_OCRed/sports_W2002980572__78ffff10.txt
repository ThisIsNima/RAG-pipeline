Abstract:
A new research area linked to ethics, virtues, and morality is servant leadership.
Scholars are currently seeking publication outlets as critics debate whether this new
leadership theory is significantly distinct, viable, and valuable for organizational
success. The aim of this study was to identify empirical studies that explored servant
leadership theory by engaging a sample population in order to assess and synthesize
the mechanisms, outcomes, and impacts of servant leadership. Thus, we sought to
provide an evidence-informed answer to how does servant leadership work, and how
can we apply it? We conducted a systematic literature review, a methodology adopted
from the medical sciences to synthesize research in a systematic, transparent, and
reproducible manner. A disciplined screening process resulted in a final sample
population of 39 appropriate studies. The synthesis of these empirical studies
revealed: a) there is no consensus on the definition of servant leadership; b) servant
leadership theory is being investigated across a variety of contexts, cultures, and
themes; c) researchers are using multiple measures to explore servant leadership; and
d) servant leadership is a viable leadership theory that helps organizations and
improves the well-being of followers. This study contributes to the development of
servant leadership theory and practice. In addition, this study contributes to the
methodology for conducting systematic literature reviews in the field of management,
highlighting an effective method for mapping out thematically, and viewing holistically,
new research topics. We conclude by offering suggestions for future research.

Servant Leadership Theory in Organizational Contexts     2 
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
Leadership is one of the most comprehensively researched social influence processes in 
the behavioral sciences. This is because the success of all economic, political, and organizational 
systems depends on the effective and efficient guidance of the leaders of these systems (Barrow, 
1977). A critical factor to understanding the success of an organization, then, is to study its 
leaders. Leadership is a skill used to influence followers in an organization to work 
enthusiastically towards goals specifically identified for the common good (Barrow, 1977; Cyert, 
2006; Plsek and Wilson, 2001). Great leaders create a vision for an organization, articulate the 
vision to the followers, build a shared vision, craft a path to achieve the vision, and guide their 
organizations into new directions (Banutu-Gomez and Banutu-Gomez, 2007; Kotter, 2001). 
According to Schneider (1987), the most important part in building an organization with a legacy 
of success is the people in it, which includes the followers (i.e., employees and volunteers) as 
well as the leaders. Leadership theories attempt to explain and organize the complexity of the 
nature of leadership and its consequences (Bacharach, 1989; Bass and Bass, 2008). Over the 
years, some leadership scholars have called attention to the implicit connection between ethics 
and leadership. A burgeoning new research area and leadership theory that has been linked to 
ethics, virtues, and morality is servant leadership (Graham, 1991; Lanctot and Irving, 2010; 
Parolini et al., 2009; Russell, 2001; Whetstone, 2002). 
Servant leadership theory‘s emphasis on service to others and recognition that the role of 
organizations is to create people who can build a better tomorrow resonates with scholars and 
practitioners who are responding to the growing perceptions that corporate leaders have become 
selfish and who are seeking a viable leadership theory to help resolve the challenges of the 21st 
century. Despite servant leadership being coined by Robert K. Greenleaf over three decades ago

in 1970, it remains understudied yet still prominently practiced in boardrooms and organizations 
(Bass and Bass, 2008; Spears, 2005). It has received significant attention in the popular press – 
(e.g., Fortune magazine and Dateline) (Spears Center, 2011) and leading organizational 
management authors have discussed the positive effects of servant leadership on organizational 
profits and employee satisfaction; see Max DePree (Leadership is an Art, 1989), Stephen Covey 
(Principle Centered Leadership, 1990), Peter Senge (The Fifth Discipline: The Art and Styles of 
the Learning Organization, 1990), Peter Block (Stewardship: Choosing Service over Self 
Interest, 1993), and Margaret Wheatley (Finding Our Way: Leadership in an Uncertain Time, 
2005). However, Greenleaf‘s (1970, 1977) conceptualization of servant leadership as a way of 
life rather than as a management technique perhaps has slowed the acceptance of this leadership 
theory in academia as scholars ask the question: If it is a way life – a philosophy, how can it be 
empirically tested? Even Greenleaf admitted servant leadership is unorthodox and would be 
difficult to operationalize and apply, as ―it is meant to be neither a scholarly treatise nor a how-
to-do-it manual‖ (Greenleaf, 1977, p. 49). The majority of research to date on servant leadership 
consists of developing theoretical frameworks and establishing measurement tools with the 
intention that future scholars can apply these tools to explore servant leadership in practice and 
as a tenable theory. Only a limited amount of research has empirically examined this construct. 
As an aid in advancing servant leadership theory, we sought to identify these empirical 
studies that investigated servant leadership by engaging a sample population in order to assess 
and synthesize its mechanisms, outcomes, and impacts. Currently, there does not exist a 
comprehensive summary of empirical studies exploring servant leadership theory in 
organizational settings (e.g., a systematic literature review), which is a gap in the extant

literature. Through exploring empirical studies investigating servant leadership theory in 
organizational contexts, we provide evidence that servant leadership is a tenable theory.  
As a promising new field of research, servant leadership faces the challenges once 
addressed by the early services marketing and sport management scholars whose new ideas and 
concepts were accepted slowly within the conservative culture of academia (Shannon, 1999). 
Similarly, servant leadership scholars have sought a variety of publication outlets for their work 
while they confront a debate on the distinctiveness and significance of this leadership theory for 
organizations as well as employees. In addition, the acceleration of knowledge production in the 
management field has resulted in a body of knowledge that is increasingly transdisciplinary, 
fragmented, and interdependent from advancement in social sciences. In management research 
the literature review is a key tool used to manage the diversity of knowledge for an academic 
inquiry; however, a critique of these reviews is that they are typically descriptive accounts of 
contributions of selected writers often arbitrarily chosen for inclusion by the researcher, and that 
these reviews may lack a critical assessment of included studies (Tranfield et al., 2003). In 
contrast, a systematic literature review (SLR) is different from traditional narrative reviews in 
that it adopts a replicable, scientific and transparent process that aims to mitigate bias through 
exhaustive literature searches and by providing an audit trail of the conclusions. A current gap in 
management research is a discussion of how to conduct a SLR, how to critically assess studies, 
and how to integrate the conclusions. In this SLR, we not only ascertain the current state of the 
field in servant leadership research and synthesize divergent studies, but also advance a rigorous 
methodology for conducting a SRL in management research. 
 
Thus, the purpose of this study was to systematically examine and organize the current 
body of research literature that either quantitatively or qualitatively explored servant leadership

theory in a given organizational setting. In this SRL we only included empirical studies that 
investigated servant leadership in an organizational context and excluded studies with a primary 
focus on model development or testing measurement instruments. Earlier reviews on the concept 
of servant leadership focused on: identifying key characteristics (Russell and Stone, 2002), 
measurement development (Barbuto and Wheeler, 2006), and proposing a theoretical framework 
(Van Dierendonck, 2011). Although these reviews help provide insight into how researchers 
have attempted to operationalize servant leadership, none of them was done in a systematic 
manner (i.e., no methodology to select articles or limit bias), and none of them specifically 
explored empirical research. 
 
 The following research questions guided this SLR: a) how was servant leadership 
defined?; b) in what contexts was servant leadership theory empirically investigated?; c) how 
was servant leadership examined (i.e., the methodology)?; and, d) what were the results of the 
examination? We begin this paper by summarizing the origin of servant leadership and follow 
with a short discussion of the development of servant leadership as a theory and a new research 
area. Next, a summary of the method used for selecting and reviewing the literature is explained, 
with details on search strategy, analysis, and assessment of the quality of the reviewed studies. 
Then, we present our findings of the SLR on empirical studies that have explored servant 
leadership theory. In addition, we discuss the methodological contribution of conducting SLRs in 
the field of management as an effective method for mapping out thematically, and viewing 
holistically, new research topics. We conclude by offering suggestions for future research and 
practice.

Servant Leadership Theory in Organizational Contexts     6 
 
 
ORIGIN OF SERVANT LEDERSHIP BY ROBERT K. GREENLEAF 
Servant leadership was introduced into an organizational context through Greenleaf‘s 
three foundational essays – The Servant as Leader (1970), The Institution as Servant (1972), and 
Trustees as Servants (1972) – all of which he published after retiring from 40 years of 
management work at AT&T. Greenleaf (1977) defined servant leadership as not just a 
management technique but a way of life which begins with ―the natural feeling that one wants to 
serve, to serve first‖ (p. 7). Greenleaf (1977) conceptualized the servant as leader from his 
impressions of Journey to the East by Hesse (1956) and used the character Leo to describe a true 
servant: ―Leadership was bestowed upon a man who was by nature a servant. . . .  His servant 
nature was the real man, not bestowed, not assumed, and not to be taken away‖ (p. 21). Servant 
leaders are distinguished by both their primary motivation to serve (what they do) and their self-
construction (who they are), and from this conscious choice of ‗doing‘ and ‗being‘ they aspire to 
lead (Sendjaya and Sarros, 2002). Greenleaf (1977) believed servant leadership was an inward 
lifelong journey.  
Upon retirement in 1964, Greenleaf launched a second career, which spanned 25 years, in 
which he articulated his new leadership paradigm – servant leadership. He promoted servant 
leadership in many publications and presentations, including lectures at Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology‘s (M.I.T.) Sloan School of Management, Harvard Business School, Dartmouth 
College, and the University of Virginia; and served as leadership consultant to institutions such 
as Ford Foundation, Lilly Endowment, M.I.T., R.K. Mellon Foundation, and the American 
Foundation for Management. In 1964 he founded the Center for Applied Ethics, renamed the 
Robert K. Greenleaf Center for Servant Leadership in 1985, which helps people understand the 
principles and practices of servant leadership (Greenleaf Center, 2011). Over 20% of Fortune

magazine top 100 companies have sought guidance from the Greenleaf Center for Servant 
Leadership, such as Starbucks, Vanguard Investment Group, Southwest Airlines, and ID 
Industries (Greenleaf Center).  
Although the contemporary study of servant leadership evolved largely from Greenleaf 
(1970, 1977), the practice of servant leadership is not a new concept, with roots dating back to 
ancient teachings of the world‘s great religions, as well as to statements of numerous great 
leaders and thinkers (Sendjaya and Sarros, 2002). The concept of servant leadership echoes the 
messages of Mother Theresa, Moses, Harriet Tubman, Lao-tzu, Mohandas Gandhi, Martin 
Luther King, Jr., Confucius, and many other religious, historic, and current leaders (Keith, 2008). 
Many scholars model Jesus Christ‘s teachings to his disciples as the ultimate example of servant 
leadership (Ebener and O‘Connell; Lanctot and Irving, 2010; Winsten, 2004). Whereas other 
leadership theories are traditionally defined only by what the leader does, servant leaders are 
defined by their character and by demonstrating their complete commitment to serve others. This 
creates one of the core challenges for theorists; how to construct models that encompass 
Greenleaf‘s theoretical message of ―servanthood-through-leadership-through-practice‖ (Prosser, 
2010, p. 28) that operates not only on a surface-level but deep within a person‘s being. Although 
scholars have agreed theories, frameworks, and models will increase our understanding of the 
meaning, implications, and applications of servant leadership, it is important to remain aware of 
the more abstract, underlying principles and concepts of a servant as a leader (Spears, 1998; 
Keith, 2008; Prosser, 2010).  
SERVANT LEADERSHIP AS A THEORY  
Although servant leadership is a growing trend being practiced by private and non-profit 
organizations alike, there is still a lack of research in this area (Farling et al., 1999). The majority

of research in servant leadership has streamed from Greenleaf‘s (1977) foundational texts and 
the Greenleaf Center (see Akuchie, 1993; Bordas, 1995; Brody, 1995; Buchen, 1998; 
Chamberlain, 1995; Frick, 1995; Gaston, 1987; Kelley, 1995; Kiechel, 1995; Kuhnert and Lewis, 
1987; Lee and Zembke, 1995; Llyod, 1996; Lopez, 1995; McCollum, 1995; McGee-Cooper and 
Trammell, 1995; Rasmussen, 1995; Rieser, 1995; Senge, 1995; Smith, 1995; Snodgrass, 1993; 
Spears, 1995, 1996; Tatum, 1995; Vanourek, 1995). Many of these writers present narrative 
examples of how servant leadership is being used in organizational settings; however, this is also 
the primary limitation of much of the servant leadership literature, which is anecdotal in nature 
instead of empirical (Bowman, 1997; Northouse, 1997; Sendjaya and Sarros, 2002). Bass (2000) 
acknowledged that servant leadership requires extensive research, emphasizing that ―the strength 
of the servant leadership movement and its many links to encouraging follower learning, growth, 
and autonomy, suggests that the untested theory will play a role in the future leadership of the 
learning organization‖ (p. 33). The promise of servant leadership has since motivated scholars 
and practitioners to explore the possibilities of the servant-first paradigm.  
Since Farling et al.‘s (1999) call for empirical studies, there have emerged three streams 
of research (Van Dierendonck and Patterson, 2011): a) a conceptual stream (Spears, 1998; Laub, 
1999; Patterson, 2003); b) a measurement stream (Page and Wong, 2000; Wong and Page, 2003; 
Ehrhart, 2004; Barbuto and Wheeler, 2006; Dennis and Bocarnea, 2005; Liden et al., 2008; 
Sendjaya et al., 2008; Van Dierendonck and Nuijte, 2011); and c) model development (Russell 
and Stone, 2002; Van Dierendonck, 2011). Notably absent from the above streams are empirical 
studies that explore servant leadership theory in a given organizational setting. In addition, in 
spite of the growing amount of research on servant leadership, the theory is still under-defined, 
with various authors grappling with definitions (Anderson, 2009). This is as Greenleaf (1977)

predicted, when he warned that servant leadership would be difficult to apply and operationalize. 
He did not provide a management how-to-do-it-manual; instead, he challenged readers to reflect, 
ponder, and grow (Frick, 2004; Spears, 1995). 
To date, three reviews of servant leadership have been conducted, which help provide 
insight into how researchers have organized the complexity of Greenleaf‘s concepts on servant 
leadership into a theoretical framework. Russell and Stone‘s (2002) review revealed the 
following nine functional attributes, or operative qualities and distinctive characteristics of 
servant leaders; vision, honesty, integrity, trust, service, modeling, pioneering, appreciation of 
others, and empowerment. In addition, Russell and Stone determined 11 accompanying 
attributes, which are interrelated and supportive of the nine core attributes listed above: 
communication, credibility, competence, stewardship, visibility, influence, persuasion, listening, 
encouragement, teaching and delegation. From this assimilation of attributes Russell and Stone 
developed a model of servant leadership to spark future application and research. While their 
review provides a conceptual overview of servant leadership, it lacks a methodology. Barbuto 
and Wheeler (2006) developed an integrated model of servant leadership after conducting a 
literature review, which synthesized the attributes of servant leadership into five factors; 
altruistic calling, emotional healing, persuasive mapping, wisdom, and organizational 
stewardship. The third review by Van Dierendonck (2011) also concludes with another 
conceptual model, which identifies six key characteristics of servant leadership: empowering and 
developing people, humility, authenticity, interpersonal acceptance, providing direction, and 
stewardship. All of these reviews exemplify different interpretations of Greenleaf‘s writings 
employing different terminologies; however, all include the fundamental dimension of 
servanthood or the willingness to serve others. These reviews highlight the plurality of servant

leadership theory, leaving the researcher, student, or practitioner to ponder exactly what servant 
leadership theory is. As DiMaggio (1995) pointed out ―there is more than one kind of good 
theory‖ (p.391).  
Given that previous reviews have examined the development of conceptual frameworks 
and measurement tools for servant leadership, the present review focuses only on empirical 
studies that have explored servant leadership theory in an organizational context. As such, the 
current study is the first review to provide a synthesis, based upon evidence in published peer 
reviewed journals, of empirical studies conducted on servant leadership theory in organizational 
settings.  
METHODOLOGY 
 
The SLR is often contrasted with traditional literature reviews because systematic 
reviews are objective, replicable, systematic, comprehensive, and the process is reported in the 
same manner as for reporting empirical research (Weed, 2005). The origin of SLRs is in the 
medical, health care, and policy fields, where they have been used to assemble the best evidence 
to make clinical and policy decisions (Cook et al., 1997; Tranfield et al., 2003). SLRs in 
management are used to provide transparency, clarity, accessibility, and impartial inclusive 
coverage on a particular area (Thorpe et al., 2006). Klassen et al (1998) define SLR as ―a review 
in which there is a comprehensive search for relevant studies on a specific topic, and those 
identified are then appraised and synthesized according to a pre-determined explicit method" (p. 
700). This SRL specifically explored research studies that have examined servant leadership 
theory in a given organizational setting. Since our focus was gaining insight on the empirical 
investigation of servant leadership theory, we excluded studies with a primary focus on model 
development or testing measurement instruments. The approach of this review entailed extensive

searches of relevant databases with the intention of ensuring, as far as possible, that all literature 
on servant leadership was identified while maintaining the focus on literature of greatest 
pertinence to the research questions – (i.e., empirical studies that have investigated servant 
leadership theory in organizational settings). Next, we discuss our search methods, inclusion and 
exclusion criteria, sample, and data analysis.  
Search Methods 
 
Published studies were identified through searches of electronic databases accessible 
through the authors‘ university library system. Databases included in this review were: PsycInfo, 
Eric, Sociological Abstracts, PAIS International, Social Services, Communication Abstracts, 
International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (IBSS), Physical Education Index, World Wide 
Political Abstracts from the vendor CSA, Academic Search Complete, Business Source 
Complete, Communication and Mass Media Complete, Education and Administration Abstracts, 
Gender Studies, CINAHL, Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition, Human Resources 
Abstracts, and Medline through the vendor EBSCO. All results were limited to English-only peer 
reviewed journal articles. The searches for published studies were conducted in a systematic 
manner, following the order of the databases listed above.  
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
 
The initial search required that articles included in the review were studies that must: a) 
be published in a peer-reviewed journal; b) be in the English language; and (c) use the keyword 
―servant leadership.‖ No restriction was placed on year of publication. The number of articles 
containing the keyword ―servant leadership‖ retrieved from each database was recorded. Next, 
we examined if there were any external duplicates from the current database being searched and 
the previous databases that had already been searched. We recorded the number of external

duplicates, and then deleted the duplicated journal articles from the last database searched while 
keeping a running total of new articles found.  
 
Once all possible studies had been identified, we conducted a second screening to assess 
eligibility against inclusion criteria and then full text articles were retrieved for those that met the 
inclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria for the second screening required that the published 
peer-reviewed article meet all of the following four specifications: a) be in the English language; 
b) be an empirical study (i.e., not an essay, book review, letter, literature review, editorial, 
opinion, journalistic or antidotal article); c) discuss servant leadership as the main topical theme; 
and d) examine servant leadership theory either quantitatively or qualitatively. Articles were 
excluded if any of these four components was not addressed in the abstract, results, or discussion 
sections of the respective study. Finally, additional articles meeting the inclusion criteria were 
found by examining the bibliographies of resources identified through the secondary screening.  
Sample 
 
Peer reviewed publications were identified using the key terms outlined in the inclusion 
and exclusion criteria section above. In all, a total of 381 articles where retrieved; however, after 
duplicates were deleted there remained 255 articles meeting the initial inclusion criteria. After 
the secondary search process was conducted, a final sample of 44 appropriate studies was 
obtained. Upon retrieving full text articles, an additional five articles were excluded after further 
examination because they did not satisfy the screening criteria. The final sample of articles 
constituted 39 empirical studies. Peer-reviewed articles meeting the outlined criteria were 
published between 2004 and 2011. The 39 published articles were drawn from a variety of peer-
reviewed journals (n=27). Table 1 depicts the list of journals included in the study, the number of 
articles included from each journal, and the database they were accessed through.

We grouped the journals by their area of focus, which showed a concentration of research taking 
place in leadership (n=9), education (n=7), business (n=6), and psychology (n=6), with the fields 
of nursing (n=3), management (n=2), personal selling and sales management (n=2), ethics (n=1), 
parks and recreation administration (n=1), services marketing (n=1), and sports (n=1)  
representing a smaller number of empirical studies. 
Data Analysis 
 
The Matrix Method (Garrard, 1999) was utilized as the strategy for organizing and 
abstracting pertinent information from these publications. For this study, the following 
information was abstracted from each article: a) how was servant leadership defined? b) in what 
contexts was servant leadership theory empirically investigated? c) how was servant leadership 
examined? and d) what were the results of the examination? Last, for each publication, the 
methodology used to examine servant leadership was evaluated. For qualitative studies, we used 
a critical appraisal tool designed by Letts et al. (2007), and for quantitative studies we used a 
critical appraisal tool designed by the Institute for Public Health Sciences (2002). In addition to 
these two appraisal assessments we used Stoltz, Udén, and William‘s (2004) critical appraisal 
tool, which assessed both quantitative and qualitative studies. We adopted these three critical 
appraisal tools to create a three-point scale to reflect the quality of studies: high (I); medium (II) 
– used if studies did not meet criteria for high (I) or low quality; and low (III). Table 2 describes 
our classification for high to low quality studies, which was based on the three critical appraisal 
tools mentioned above.

The findings from these studies were summarized and placed into matrixes (i.e., tables). Our 
SLR findings consist of a synthesis of the results from all 39 empirical studies along with the 
assessment of quality for each study. Further, we assess the level of supporting evidence for 
thematic conclusions drawn from combining the results of multiple studies. 
 
FINDINGS 
 
Overall, this review highlights that servant leadership theory is being researched and 
tested across a variety of contexts, cultures, disciplines, and themes. Our sample included 11 
qualitative studies, 27 quantitative studies, and one mixed method study, all empirically 
assessing servant leadership theory. Thus, this review illustrates that servant leadership is being 
explored both quantitatively and qualitatively, and the topic has an international appeal with 
studies being conducted in 11 countries. In the quality assessment, 22 studies were classified as 
high, 12 as medium, and five as low quality. Conclusive statements were made based upon the 
synthesis of findings from each article. The conclusions (see Table 3) were classified as A 
(strong evidence) or B (moderate evidence) based on scientific strength.

medium quality or two studies of medium quality were assigned a (B) rating. If a conclusion(s) 
did not fall under (A) strong evidence in favor of conclusion or (B) moderate evidence in favor 
of conclusion, we classified it as insufficiently supported and labeled insufficient evidence. The 
following discussion of our findings is organized around the four central research questions. 
How was Servant Leadership Defined? 
 
Servant leadership theory was introduced to readers by authors of empirical studies by 
citing one or all three of the following: Greenleaf (1977), Spears (1995, 1998, 2004), and Laub 
(1999). Generally, authors described servant leadership by quoting one of these three authors in 
addition to citing multiple other authors, including, but not limited to: Barbuto and Wheeler 
(2006), Graham (1991), Ehrhart (2004), Liden et al., (2008), Page and Wong (2000), and 
Patterson (2003). Here, we discuss the three most cited authors on servant leadership that have 
provided definitions. 
 
Greenleaf (1970, 1972, 1977), the grandfather of servant leadership, was cited by 37 of 
the 39 empirical studies. The majority of authors used part or all of Greenleaf‘s description from 
his original essay, The Servant as Leader (1970): 
It begins with the natural feeling one wants to serve, to serve first. Then conscious choice 
brings one to aspire to lead. That person is sharply different from one who is leader first.  
. . . The difference manifests itself in the care taken by the servant-first to make sure that 
other people‘s highest priority needs are being served. The best test, and difficult to 
administer, is this: Do those served grow as persons? Do they, while being served, 
become healthier, wiser, freer, more autonomous, more likely themselves to become 
servants? And, what is the effect on the least privileged in society? Will they benefit or at 
least not be further deprived? (Greenleaf, 1970 as cited in Greenleaf 1977, p. 27).

The majority of authors in our sample, like Greenleaf himself, defined servant leadership theory 
in a descriptive manner. These descriptions usually cited multiple scholarly works in the 
conceptual and measurement research streams, in addition to citing leading organizational 
management authors. 
 
The second most referenced author defining servant leadership theory was Larry Spears. 
Like Greenleaf, Spears gained his knowledge from practice with most of his works being non-
empirical. He served for 17 years as the head of the Greenleaf Center, has authored more than 10 
books on servant leadership, and in 2008 established the Larry C. Spears Center for Servant 
Leadership, Inc. (Spears Center, 2011). Spears (1995, 1998, 2004) identified 10 characteristics of 
servant leaders from Greenleaf‘s writings: listening, empathy, healing, awareness, persuasion, 
philosophy, conceptualization, foresight, stewardship, commitment to the growth of people, and 
building community. These attributes are described in Table 4.  
------------------------------ 
 
Insert Table 4 about here 
 
------------------------------ 
 
Four of the qualitative studies in our sample used Spear‘s 10 characteristics to inform their 
analysis (Crippen, 2004; Crippen and Wallin, 2008a, 2008b; Strum, 2009). 
 
The third most cited author in defining servant leadership theory is Laub (1999). His 
Organizational Leadership Assessment (OLA) was an outcome of his dissertation. The OLA 
assesses an organization‘s health based upon the six key areas of an effective servant-minded 
organization by exploring the perceptions of top leaders, managers and supervisors, and the 
workforce; however, it does not assess the servant leadership of individual leaders (OLA Group, 
2011). Authors in our sample used Laub‗s definition, which terms the practice of servant

leadership as placing ―the good of those led over the self-interest of the leader‖ (1999, p. 81). In 
addition, authors would list and describe Laub‘s six key variables of an effective servant-led 
organization: a) values people – believing, serving, and non-judgmentally listening to others; b) 
develops people – providing learning, growth, encouragement and affirmation; c) builds 
community – developing strong collaborative and personal relationships; d) displays authenticity 
– being open, accountable, and willing to learn from others; e) provides leadership – foreseeing 
the future, taking initiative, and establishing goals; and f) shares leadership – facilitating and 
sharing power. The OLA has been widely used in health organizations (OLA Group), and was 
used in six quantitative studies in our sample (Herman, 2010; Black, 2010; Cerit, 2010; Cerit, 
2009; Irving and Longbotham, 2007; Joseph and Winston, 2005). 
In summary, our results confirm Anderson‘s (2009) and Van Dierendonck‘s (2011) 
assessments that servant leadership theory remains under-defined with no consensus on its 
definition or theoretical framework. Scholars are still seeking to articulate Greenleaf‘s 
conceptualization of servant leadership by using a variety of definitions sourced from multiple 
works.  
In what Contexts was Servant Leadership Theory Empirically Investigated?  
 
Our sample illustrates servant leadership theory is being studied across cultures, contexts, 
and across a diversity of research foci. Overall, the sample consisted of studies in 11 countries, 
which included four cross-cultures studies. These findings demonstrate that servant leadership is 
being practiced in various cultures, specifically: U.S. ( n=23), Canada (n=4), China (n=2), 
Turkey (n=2), Indonesia (n=1), New Zealand (n =1), Kenya (n=1), and the Republic of Trinidad 
(n=1), with five cross-culture studies comparing U.S. and Ghana, U.S. and UK, U.S. and China 
(n=2), and Indonesia and Australia.

A contextual analysis of the sample revealed that servant leadership theory is being 
applied in the following organizational settings: education (n=17), which consisted of religious 
schools (n=6) and secular schools (n=11); secular for profit organizations (n=17), which notably 
included financial services (n=4) and nursing (n=3); public organizations (n=2); religious 
organizations (n=1); non-profit organizations (n=1); and in a historical context (n=1). It is 
important to note that servant leadership was examined in a religious context in seven of the 39 
studies, and that the education field represents 44% of the contextual environment for the entire 
sample. 
This synthesis also revealed seven key research themes, with some studies containing 
more than one area of focus. The themes and their associated studies are presented in Table 3. 
An overall count and description of each theme is as follows: a) cross-cultural applicability – 
acceptance, practices, and different weights of servant leadership in a variety of cultures (n=7); 
b) servant leadership attributes – conceptual models characteristics were studied (n=7); c) team 
level effectiveness – effects of servant leadership explored at the unit level (n=20); d) followers‘ 
well-being – effects on employees in a servant-led environment (n=20); e) spirituality – 
connection between spiritual workplace and servant-led workplace was investigated (n=1); f) 
demographics (n=3); and g) implementation of servant leadership (n=3). We discuss a synthesis 
of these themes below in the last section of our findings, where we provide an overview of the 
results of studies included in the sample.

How was Servant Leadership Examined (i.e., the Methodology)? 
 
All of the 27 quantitative studies used surveys as the data collection method. The two 
most popular measures of servant leadership theory used by these empirical studies were Laub‘s 
(1999) OLA instrument – used by six studies (Herman, 2010; Black, 2010; Cerit, 2010; Cerit, 
2009; Irving and Longbotham, 2007; Joseph and Winston, 2005 ) and the Servant Leadership 
Scale developed by Ehrhart (2004) – used by six studies (Ehrhart, 2004; Jaramillo et al., 2009a, 
2009b; Mayer et al., 2008; Neubert et al., 2008; Walumbwa et al., 2010). Instruments that were 
utilized by two studies included: Barbuto and Wheeler‘s (2006) instrument (Jenkins and 
Steward, 2010; Garber et al., 2009); Liden et al.‘s. (2008) instrument (Hu and Liden, 2011; 
Schaubroeck et al., 2011); and Sendjaya et al.‘s. (2008) survey (Pekerti and Sendjaya, 2010; 
Sendjaya and Perketi, 2010). Taylor et al. (2007) used Page and Wong‘s (1998) self-assessment 
measure. Washington et al. (2006) used Dennis and Winston‘s (2003) instrument, which was an 
adopted version of Page and Wong‘s (2000) instrument. Rieke, Hammermeister, and Chase 
(2008) used Hammermeister, Burton, Pickering, Westro, Baldwin, and Chase‘s (2008) 
instrument, which was also an adopted version of Page and Wong‘s instrument. Babakus, Yavas, 
and Ashill (2011) and Hale and Fields (2007) used lesser known scales, those of Lytle, Hom, and 
Mokwa (1998) and Dennis (2004) respectively. One study tapped a survey designed by the U.S. 
Office of Personal Management (OPM). Four studies used surveys developed specifically for the 
research: Fridell, Belcher, and Messner (2009), Reinke (2004), and McCuddy and Cavin (2008, 
2009). In summary, out of 27 survey studies, there were 14 different measures used. It is 
important to note that the majority of authors combined multiple measurement scales to construct 
their surveys. In addition, the majority of these measures explored servant leadership theory at

the unit level of analysis (i.e., group or team performance) while only a few examined it at the 
individual level of analysis (i.e., individual performance).  
 
Similarly, the 11 qualitative studies used a variety of servant leadership frameworks to 
inform their analyses, while three studies did not provide any information on frameworks. Four 
of the qualitative studies used Spear‘s (1998) 10 characteristics to inform their analyses 
(Crippen, 2004; Crippen and Wallin, 2008a, 2008b; Strum, 2009). Two studies used Patterson 
(2003) and Winsten‘s (2003) models – Dingman and Stone (2007) and Winston (2004). Han et 
al. (2010) used multiple dimensions and definitions of servant leadership in Western literature 
including but not limited to: Barbuto and Wheeler (2006); Liden et al. (2008); Ehrhart (2004); 
and Sendjaya et al. (2008). The multiple quantitative and qualitative measures used by the 
studies in our sample reinforce our findings for research question one, where it was found that 
authors have defined servant leadership in various ways. Similarly, as this review demonstrates, 
there is still not an agreed upon measurement strategy for servant leadership theory. 
What were the Results of the Examination? 
  
Our sample of empirical studies illustrates that servant leadership is a tenable theory. It is 
viable and valuable on an individual and an organization level, which can lead to increased 
overall effectiveness of individuals and teams. In Table 3, a synthesis of the conclusions from 
our sample of articles is divided by theme, with a rating of the evidence to support each 
individual conclusion. We discuss the results of these empirical studies by theme below.  
 
Cross-cultural applicability. The cross-cultural studies (Hamilton and Bean, 2005 – 
U.S. and UK; Hale and Fields, 2007 – U.S. and Ghana; Han et al., 2010 – U.S. and China; 
Pekerti and Sendjaya, 2010 – Indonesia and Australia; Schaubroeck, et al. (2011) – U.S. and 
China) all indicate servant leadership‘s acceptability across a variety of cultures. However, these

studies also show that the different attributes perceived to make up servant leadership are not 
weighted equally across cultures. For example: Hale and Fields (2007) found that vision had a 
significantly stronger relationship with leader effectiveness for Ghanaians in comparison to 
North Americans; Han, Kakabadse, and Kakabadse (2009) found ―being dutiful‖ to be an 
extended form of servant leadership in China; Hamilton and Bean (2010) discovered that 
introducing servant leadership within a Christian context was perceived as obtrusive in the 
United Kingdom; and Perkerti and Sedjaya (2010) found that Australian leaders exhibited more 
behaviors with authentic self (leadership flows out of who we are as opposed to what we do), 
while Indonesian leaders exhibited more behaviors with responsible morality (reflective moral 
reasoning employed to assess whether or not the process and outcomes of one‘s leadership are 
ethical) and transforming influence (articulation and implementation of a shared vision which 
provides inspiration, meaning to one‘s work, and creates a positive work environment). In 
contrast to these findings, Schaubroeck, et al. (2011) found no significant differences in 
perceptions of servant leadership between Hong Kong and the U.S. These cross-cultural studies, 
along with studies conducted in different countries, imply that servant leadership might be 
practiced across a variety of cultures, but culture-specific perceptions of servant leadership exist 
based on socialization and national context. 
 
Servant leader attributes. Seven studies explored the conceptual definitions of servant 
leadership, and found Spear‘s (1998), Patterson‘s (2003), and Winston‘s (2003) attributes to be 
representative of servant leadership in different contexts. Five studies (Boroski and Greif, 2009; 
Crippen, 2004; Crippen and Wallin, 2008a, 2008b; Sturm, 2009) within three different contexts 
(schools, community, and nursing) supported Spear‘s 10 characteristics (see Table 3). Two 
studies (Winston, 2004; Dingman and Stone, 2007) provided support for Patterson‘s (2003)

leader-to-follower and Winston‘s (2003) follower-to-leader models of servant leadership. 
Patterson‘s model of leader-follower interaction starts with the leaders‘ agapaó (love for others) 
which she conceptualizes as a collection of the following seven values: being teachable; showing 
concern for others; demonstrating discipline; seeking the greatest good for the organization; 
showing mercy in actions and beliefs with all people; meeting the needs of followers and the 
organization; and creating a place where peace grows within the organization. These seven 
values are based upon the biblical concept of the seven beatitudes from Matthew 5 (Patterson, 
2003; Winston, 2003, 2004). Instead of focusing on leader-follower interaction as Patterson‘s 
model does, Winston‘s model focuses on the follower-to-leader interactions. Winston‘s follower-
to-leader model starts with the followers‘ agapaó and then shows how the followers are servant 
leaders themselves by utilizing the same variables as Patterson‘s model. As stated above, studies 
confirm the applicability of the variables in both of these models: trust, empowerment, vision, 
altruism, intrinsic motivation, commitment, and service (Winston, 2004; Dingman and Stone, 
2007). Thus, the attributes identified by Spears, Patterson, and Winston were represented within 
the measurement instruments discussed above.  
 
Team level effectiveness. Sixteen empirical studies explored servant leadership theory at 
a unit level. Overall, these studies found that a servant-led organization enhances leader trust and 
organizational trust, organizational citizenship behavior, procedural justice, team and leader 
effectiveness, and the collaboration between team members. Several studies found that a servant-
led environment provided affirmation of justice and fair treatment, which is positively associated 
with procedural justice, or the perception of how a work group as a whole is treated (Ehrhart, 
2004; Walumbwa et al., 2010; Chung et al., 2010). Procedural justice fosters trust in the servant 
leader and in the servant-led organization (Joseph and Winston, 2005; Reinke, 2004; Senjaya and

Pekerti, 2010; Washington et al., 2006). This creates an open and trusting environment, which 
can enhance collaboration among team members (Garber et al., 2009; Sturm, 2009; Irving and 
Longbotham, 2007). Collaboration in a servant-led organization creates a helping culture (i.e., a 
spirit of willingness), which increases team members‘ organizational citizenship behavior, 
defined as pro-social and altruistic behaviors that have been shown to improve organizational 
performance (Ebener and O'Connell, 2010; Hu and Liden, 2011; Ehrhart; Walumbwa et al., 
2010). Servant leadership also improves overall team effectiveness (Taylor et al., 2007; Mayer et 
al., 2008; McCuddy and Cavin, 2008) and can enhance leaders‘ effectiveness (Irving & 
Longbotham, 2007; Schaubroeck et al., 2011; Hu and Liden, 2011). In summary, servant 
leadership creates a trusting, fair, collaborative, and helping culture that can result in greater 
individual and organizational effectiveness.  
 
Followers’ well-being. Findings from 15 empirical studies illustrate that servant 
leadership enhances followers‘ well-being. These studies showed conceptually and empirically 
how servant leadership influences followers‘ well-being by creating a positive work climate 
(Neubert et al., 2008; Black, 2010; Jaramillo et al., 2009a), which is related to greater 
organizational commitment (Cerit, 2010; Hamilton and Bean, 2005; Hale and Fields, 2007; Han 
et al., 2010; Pekerti and Sendjaya, 2010). Greater commitment to the organization increases 
employee job satisfaction (Cerit, 2009; Jenkins and Stewart, 2010; Mayer et al., 2008; Chung, et 
al., 2010) and consequently decreases employee turnover (Jaramillo et al., 2009b; Babakus et al., 
2011). Servant leaders create these positive outcomes by developing trust while nurturing 
followers, which encourages the creativity, helping behaviors, and well-being of followers 
(Jaramillo et al., 2009a; Babakus et al., 2011; Rieke et al., 2008). Overall, these studies support 
the notion that servant leadership can improve followers‘ well-being.

Spirituality. One study (Herman, 2010) found a positive connection between workplace 
spirituality and servant leadership, while six studies explored servant leadership within religious 
intuitions. In addition, many scholars described servant leadership using the teachings of Jesus 
Christ as a reference (Ebener and O‘Connell; Hamilton and Bean, 2005; Winsten, 2004). 
Although there appears to be a relationship between spirituality and servant leadership, there was 
insufficient evidence to draw conclusions for this review. 
 
Demographics. Three studies (Fridell et al., 2009; McCuddy and Cavin, 2009; Taylor et 
al., 2007) attempted to identify demographic characteristics conducive to practicing servant 
leadership. However, these studies lacked methodological quality sufficient to support any 
conclusions. In addition, many of the findings of these studies contradicted each other as well as 
other studies within our sample. For example, one study found significant differences between 
men and women‘s servant leadership style usage – female leaders were more likely to practice 
daily reflection and consensus building, foster self worth, and engage in healing relationships 
(Fridell et al., 2009), while another study found no difference (McCuddy and Cavin, 2009). Also, 
one study found that socio-economic factors were positively related to servant behaviors 
(McCuddy and Cavin, 2009), while another study found that no demographic variables were 
significantly related to servant leadership (Taylor et al., 2007) Therefore, it remains to be 
discovered if there are in fact demographic characteristics that are related to servant leadership. 
 
Implementation of servant leadership. Three studies examined servant leadership in 
various organizational processes (Hamilton and Bean, 2005 – leadership development; Savage-
Austin & Honeycutt, 2011 – organizational change; Dingman and Stone, 2007 – succession 
planning). Nevertheless, these studies were not supported by other empirical studies nor was 
their methodological quality sufficient to provide any conclusions.

LIMITATIONS 
 
Although this SLR was conducted in a disciplined manner, potential limitations must be 
acknowledged. We limited the search process to indexed journals available through the authors‘ 
university library system that were peer reviewed published articles written in the English 
language. Thus, this review did not include non-indexed journals or dissertations because they 
are not peer-reviewed, or peer-reviewed servant leadership articles published in a language other 
than English. Given the apparent universal interest in servant leadership, as identified in our 
review, perhaps there are more empirical studies being published in other languages that would 
complement or contradict some of the conclusions drawn from this review. The methodology 
and findings of the studies included in the review were assessed by two independent reviewers 
aided by a critical assessment tool, which was utilized to make the evaluation phase more 
accurate. However, our attempt to integrate results conducted with qualitative as well as 
quantitative data analysis may have limited the ability to sufficiently explore all methodological 
considerations when fusing the findings of both types of empirical studies into a coherent text. In 
order to guide future scholars in conducting SLRs, more work is needed on how to assess the 
quality of qualitative and quantitative research in the field of management. Given SLRs origins 
are in the medical field, which conduct controlled trial studies, there are few critical appraisal 
tools that are applicable to the research methods used in other disciplines, such as qualitative 
inquiry and cross-sectional studies.  
CONCLUSION 
 
This SLR demonstrates servant leadership theory is applicable in a variety of cultures, 
contexts, and organizational settings. Even though Greenleaf first coined the philosophy in the 
1970s, it has taken until 2004 for servant leadership to be explored in an empirical manner. This

SLR did not place any limitation on the publication year of peer-reviewed journal articles; 
however, no empirical studies were found across all the databases searched before 2004. To date, 
the majority of research in servant leadership is either attempting to conceptually define and 
model the theory or develop measurement tools to empirical test it. Thus, the greater part of 
research on servant leadership is addressing one of the major criticisms of the theoretical 
construct, which is the difficulty of operationalizing its concepts and principles (Brumback, 
1999; Wong and Davey, 2007). Quay is not alone in his sentiments on Greenleaf‘s works: ―For 
all his good advice and many practical ideas, he is a Don Quixote trying to convince managers to 
pursue good and eschew evil‖ (1997: 83). By Greenleaf‘s own admission, his ideas are 
unorthodox, yet the value of this review illustrates that servant leadership works and is a tenable 
theory. 
 
The first question of this review sought to discover how servant leadership is being 
defined. Although our findings indicated the majority of authors use Greenleaf (1970, 1972, 
1977), Spears (1998), and Laub (1999) to help define servant leadership, there still does not exist 
an accepted consensus over its definition. This lack of consensus creates confusion (Van 
Dierendonck, 2011) amongst researchers, as they create their own variations of definitions and 
theoretical models. Perhaps one day there will be a generally accepted theory of servant 
leadership, but the empirical cross-cultural studies in this review highlight that while servant 
leadership has been researched in a variety of cultures, it has different meanings based on 
socialization and national context. In addition, Greenleaf (1977) argued that servant leadership is 
an inward life-long journey, implying that the meaning of servant leadership could change 
throughout one‘s life time. Therefore, this review does not conclude with a model or another 
definition of servant leadership; however, it does provide an overview of multiple definitions of

servant leadership currently being used in empirical studies in order to further our conceptual 
understanding. 
 
Second, this review explored the contexts in which servant leadership is being 
empirically investigated. Our review illustrates the diversity of cultures, organizational settings, 
and research foci in which servant leadership is being explored. There seems to be pronounced 
interest in investigating servant leadership in the U.S. and throughout the Asia Pacific region; 
however, there is a paucity of studies being conducted in other parts of the world. Currently, the 
majority of studies are exploring servant leadership in an educational setting (44% of our 
sample). Organizational settings that have received less attention from researchers include 
medical institutions, public organizations, non-profit organizations, and community-level 
organizations. Research on servant leadership is concentrated in the fields of leadership, 
education, business and psychology; whereas, there is only a small number of studies in the 
fields of nursing, management, personal selling and sales, ethics, parks and recreation 
administration, services marketing, and sports. The research themes being explored the least are: 
spirituality, demographics, and implementation of servant leadership. Thus, this review helps 
researchers identify areas and contexts which are relatively unexplored in relation to servant 
leadership and thus ripe for further investigation. 
 
Third, this review examined the tools that can be used to measure the existence and 
outcomes of servant leadership. The multiple quantitative and qualitative measures used by the 
studies point to the fact that there is currently not an agreed upon measurement instrument of the 
theoretical construct. This review can point researchers towards the current measurement tools 
available, how they are being used, and in what contexts they are being applied. Last, this review 
synthesized the findings of these empirical studies (see Table 3). Seven research themes

emerged: cross-cultural applicability, servant leadership attributes, team level effectiveness, 
followers‘ well-being, spirituality, demographics, and implementation of servant leadership. This 
synthesis can help researchers identify the current findings in the extant literature and to discover 
research foci that remain relatively underexplored. 
 
Several intriguing directions for future research emerged from our SLR. First, this SLR 
only identified 39 empirical studies that explored servant leadership theory in organizational 
settings, highlighting the need for researchers to empirically investigate the construct of servant 
leadership in a variety of organizational contexts. In the burgeoning field of entrepreneurship, 
researchers could explore how to build a servant-led organization, or in the field of 
organizational change, studies could explore how to implement servant leadership in an 
established organization or during a merger or acquisition. Second, there is a need to investigate 
the antecedents of servant leadership development, such as personal attributes of the leader, 
background of the leader, and organizational history and trajectory. Third, researchers can 
examine other outcomes of servant leadership, such as voluntarily organizational turnover, 
succession planning, affective organizational commitment, and employee well-being through 
generative growth. Last, there is a need to develop critical appraisal tools for quantitative and 
quantitative research used in the field of management to conduct SLRs. Perhaps our integration 
of several appraisal tools can serve as a template, as we assessed the level of supporting evidence 
for thematic conclusions drawn from combining the results of multiple studies.  
  
This SLR is the first synthesis of empirical studies exploring servant leadership theory in 
organizational contexts that utilizes a rigorous methodology to mitigate bias through exhaustive 
literature searches and by providing an audit trail of the conclusions. This review enhances our 
understanding of the definition(s) of servant leadership, illustrates the diversity of cultures,

organizational settings, and research foci in which it is being examined, identifies tools that can 
be used to measure its existence and outcomes, and shows that servant leadership is a viable 
leadership theory that helps organizations and the well-being of followers. Our findings 
synthesize empirical research on servant leadership theory across the multidisciplinary fields of 
business, medicine, psychology, religion, leisure, education, and economics and law. Scholars 
exploring servant leadership are using theories from other disciplines to build upon existing 
theory and to develop theory that is uniquely applicable to their field (e.g., organizational 
behavior, sport, gender). Thus, this SLR validated servant leadership as a viable and valuable 
theory, and therefore, illustrates how servant leadership theory can be used to inform future 
empirical studies. In addition, and importantly, this SLR contributes to advancing the 
methodology of conducting a SLR in the management context. Here, we showcase how a SRL 
can provide an effective method for mapping out thematically the current body of research 
literature that empirically explores servant leadership theory in organizational contexts. 
However, this type of systematic review with rigorous methodology can be applied to other 
research streams within management as an aid in holistically synthesizing the state of the field in 
various topical areas. 
As a viable leadership theory, servant leadership can perhaps provide the ethical 
grounding and leadership framework needed to help address the challenges of the 21st century: 
technological advancements, economic globalization, increased communications, the Internet, 
rising terrorism, environmental degradation, war and violence, disease and starvation, threat of 
global warming, intensifying gap between the poor and rich worldwide, as well as many other 
unsolved issues. Servant leadership contrasts, traditional leader-first paradigms, which applaud a 
Darwinism, individualistic, and capitalist approach to life, implicating that only the strong will

survive. Sadly, this belief system is operating at the heart of most organizations and is the 
consequence of most of our modern tragedies: Arthur Andersen and Enron, Dennis Kozlowski 
and Tyco, and Bernard Ebbers and WorldCom (Forbes, 2002). Servant leaders believe ―the 
world does not have to be like this‖ (Keith, 2008, p. ix) and actively work at changing society for 
the better. In short, this review shows servant leadership can help address these ethical dilemmas.
