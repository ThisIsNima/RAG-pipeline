weakly anisotropic upper mantle layer below 250 km depth is
actively deforming by dislocation creep, and hence the top and
bottom layers may be strongly coupled down to 400 km depth. Our
predictions (that weak seismic anisotropy will develop in olivine-
rich aggregates deforming by [001](hk0) slip in the deep upper
mantle) challenge the two traditional interpretations for regions in
the deep Earth of weak seismic anisotropy; (1) that they represent
zones of poor deformation coherence at the seismic length scale, or
(2) that the dominant deformation mechanism (for example,
diffusion creep) in these regions does not produce CPO. Indeed,
transition from dominant [100] to [001] slip at high pressure may
explain the variation with depth of the anisotropy patterns of P and
S waves, even if the entire upper mantle deforms coherently with a
dominant horizontal shearing component (as expected in a con-
vective system with large-scale plates at the surface, like the Earth’s
mantle).

In 1967 the Kibish Formation in southern Ethiopia yielded
hominid cranial remains identiﬁed as early anatomically modern
humans, assigned to Homo sapiens1–4. However, the provenance
and age of the fossils have been much debated5,6. Here we conﬁrm
that the Omo I and Omo II hominid fossils are from similar
stratigraphic levels in Member I of the Kibish Formation, despite
the view that Omo I is more modern in appearance than Omo
II1–3. 40Ar/39Ar ages on feldspar crystals from pumice clasts
within a tuff in Member I below the hominid levels place an older
limit of 198 6 14 kyr (weighted mean age 196 6 2 kyr) on the
hominids. A younger age limit of 104 6 7 kyr is provided by
feldspars from pumice clasts in a Member III tuff. Geological
evidence indicates rapid deposition of each member of the Kibish
Formation. Isotopic ages on the Kibish Formation correspond to
ages of Mediterranean sapropels, which reﬂect increased ﬂow of
the Nile River, and necessarily increased ﬂow of the Omo River.
Thus the 40Ar/39Ar age measurements, together with the sapropel
correlations, indicate that the hominid fossils have an age close to
the older limit. Our preferred estimate of the age of the Kibish
hominids is 195 6 5 kyr, making them the earliest well-dated
anatomically modern humans yet described.
The principal outcrops of the Kibish Formation are along the
Omo River where it skirts the Nkalabong Range (Fig. 1), with the
highest outcrops close in elevation to that of the watershed between
the Omo and the Nile rivers7,8. Former hydrographic links are
apparent from Nilotic fauna in the Turkana Basin sequence8–10.
The Kibish Formation (about 100 m thick) consists of ﬂat-lying,
tectonically undisturbed, unconsolidated sediments deposited
mainly in deltaic environments over brief periods. It comprises
the youngest exposed sedimentary sequence in the Omo Basin, and
lies disconformably upon the Nkalabong Formation11,12 or on the
underlying Mursi Formation12. Strata are composed principally of
claystone and siltstone, with subordinate ﬁne sandstone, conglom-
erate and tuffs (Fig. 2).
Butzer et al.13 and Butzer14 divided the Kibish Formation into
Members I to IV on the basis of disconformities with up to 30 m
relief (Fig. 2). The members record discrete times of deposition

when the northern margin of Lake Turkana and the Omo delta lay
about 100 km north of their current positions. As the higher lake
levels reﬂect signiﬁcantly higher precipitation in the region, such
periods should be recognizable at least regionally, and perhaps
globally.
Member I (26 m thick; Fig. 2) was deposited disconformably on
the Nkalabong Formation in a deltaic environment. Small (less than
30 mm) rounded pumice clasts occur in an impure tuff in Member
I, 7 m below the base of Member II. This tuff lies near, but probably
slightly below, the levels from which Omo I and Omo II were
derived. Glass shards from the tuff are very similar in composition
to the glass from three pumice clasts enclosed in the tuff (Sup-
plementary Table 1), indicating a common origin. Further, this
composition is distinct from the glass composition of any other tuff
in the Kibish Formation. Member II, about 28 m thick, was
deposited on a topographic surface developed on Member I with
at least 19 m of relief. Member II contains two discrete sequences,
separated by an internal disconformity, designated Members IIa and
IIb on Fig. 2. Member II was incised by as much as 25 m before the
deposition of Member III11,14, which begins with thin siltstone and
claystone beds that drape topography. These beds, averaging
about 3 cm thick, ﬁne upward internally, and represent annual
ﬂooding. Thus, deposition of the lower part of Member III may
record less than 1 kyr. A tuff 3.5–12 m thick, 18 m above the base
of Member III, locally contains pumice clasts with alkali feldspar
phenocrysts. Glass of the pumices normally differs composition-
ally from the glass of the tuff (Supplementary Table 1). However,
one pumice sample yielded two contrasting sets of analyses: one
corresponding to the tuff, the other to the dominant pumices.
The youngest unit of the Kibish Formation, Member IV, was
deposited on the underlying sediments after up to 30 m of
dissection. Member IV comprises at most 21 m of strata depos-
ited between about 9.5 and 3.3 kyr ago, on the basis of 14C dating
of mollusc shell7,14,15.
Omo I was found at Kamoya’s Hominid Site (KHS; 58 24.15
0 N,
358 55.81
0 E), which was identiﬁed from contemporary photo-
graphs, from evidence of the 1967 excavations and by additional
hominid bone material conjoining the 1967 ﬁnds16. The hominid
fossils were recovered from a siltstone 2.4 m below the base of
Member II14. Thus, Omo I derives from near the top of Member
I. Butzer et al.13 reported a 230Th/234U date of 130 ^ 5 kyr on Etheria

from essentially the same level as the hominid, but they and others
have questioned the reliability of the age5,6.
Omo II was found on the surface at PHS (Paul’s Hominid Site),
which Butzer14 mapped about 2.6 km northwest of KHS. A map
drawn at the time by Paul Abell (discoverer of Omo II), together
with contemporary photographs of the site supplied by K.W. Butzer,
have positively identiﬁed PHS at 58 24.55
0 N, 358 54.07
0 E, about
3.3 km west by north of KHS (Fig. 1). Although PHS was mislocated
on the published map, Butzer’s14 stratigraphic description at the site
is correct. The base of Member II lies about 3 m above the
approximate level from which Omo II was recovered. The basal
tuff of Member II is of unique composition, and correlates from
KHS to PHS (Supplementary Table 1).
Ages on alkali feldspars separated from pumice clasts from tuffs
in Members I and III reﬂect the time of their eruption, and provide
maximum and minimum ages for the hominid fossils, respectively.
40Ar/39Ar results are summarized in Table 1, with details listed in
Supplementary Tables 2–4.
The ﬁve pumice clasts measured from Member I yielded three
different ages (Table 1), with at least the oldest age interpreted as
evidence for reworking of that particular pumice clast. Nine
analyses on 99-273A gave a mean age of 320 ^ 19 kyr. Seven
analyses on 99-273B yielded a mean age of 221 ^ 13 kyr after
rejecting one outlier (269 ^ 18 kyr). Single feldspar crystals from
02-01B yielded a mean age of 195 ^ 11 kyr (n ¼ 14), forming a
concordant data set after one rejection (333 ^ 6 kyr). Multiple
crystals (n # 3) were analysed in 12 of 16 measurements for
02-01A, and in 8 of 14 analyses for 02-01C (n # 4). No ages were
rejected on 02-01A, whose mean age is 204 ^ 15 kyr, or on 02-01C,
whose mean age is 196 ^ 15 kyr. It is probable that these latter three
pumice clasts are products of the same volcanic eruption, as shown
by their concordant ages and similar mean K/Ca ratios. When
combined, all 44 analyses provide an arithmetic mean age of
198 ^ 14 kyr and a weighted mean age of 195.8 ^ 1.6 kyr. The
mean age calculated for pumice 99-273B is statistically older than
the ages determined on the three pumice clasts 02-01, so that 99-
273B might also be a reworked pumice clast. Clearly, the age of
deposition of a tuff must be younger than the youngest igneous
component found within it. Thus, this tuffaceous level of Member I
of the Kibish Formation was deposited after 196 kyr ago, on
the basis of the mean age determined on the three 02-01 pumice
clasts.
Feldspars from four pumice clasts from the Member III tuff were
analysed. Two were in situ (99-275A, C), and two (99-274A, B) had
weathered out of the same unit about 150 m farther east (Fig. 1).
Ages on 99-275A range from 98.0 ^ 7.7 kyr to 114.6 ^ 4.3 kyr. Five
single-crystal measurements have an arithmetic mean age of
105.5 ^ 7.0 kyr, identical to ﬁve measurements on groups of two
or three crystals (mean age 105.4 ^ 2.7 kyr), indicating a homo-
geneous population. The overall mean age is 105.4 ^ 5.0 kyr, with a
weighted mean age of 106.0 ^ 1.6 kyr. Eleven analyses on sample
99-275C yield a mean age of 107.5 ^ 7.1 kyr and a weighted mean of
105.4 ^ 1.8 kyr, after rejection of two outliers (142.1 ^ 3.3 and
128.8 ^ 8.3 kyr). Concordant results from 99-274A on seven single
crystals and six pairs of crystals gave an overall arithmetic mean age
of 98.1 ^ 5.3 kyr. The companion clast 99-274B gave a mean age of
105.0 ^ 8.3 kyr, after elimination of one outlier (Supplementary
Table 4). Again these results reﬂect a single age population, as shown
by the similar mean ages of the individual pumices, and the
overlapping average K/Ca ratios. Combining all these results (except
outliers), the overall arithmetic mean age is 103.7 ^ 7.4 kyr
(n ¼ 47) and the weighted mean age is 103.7 ^ 0.9 kyr. Thus, the
depositional age must be equal to or younger than 104 kyr, provid-
ing evidence that Members I and II of the Kibish Formation are
older than 104 kyr.
Each of the members of the Kibish Formation was deposited
during intervals when Lake Turkana was at a much higher level than
at present, and Member II has an internal disconformity. The upper
part of Member Iwas being deposited at or after 196 kyr ago, and the
upper part of Member III was being deposited at or after 104 kyr
ago; 14C ages on Member IV correspond to deposition between 9.5
and 3.3 kyr ago. These ages are remarkably similar to ages of
Mediterranean sapropels S7, S4 and S1. Sapropels S1–S7 have the
following estimated ages: 195 kyr (S7), 172 kyr (S6), 124 kyr (S5),
102 kyr (S4), 81 kyr (S3), 55 kyr (S2) and 8 kyr (S1)17. In many cases
sapropels are related to a greatly increased ﬂow of the Nile River into
the Mediterranean Sea as a consequence of intensiﬁcation of the
African monsoon18, recorded in more negative d18O in planktonic
foraminifera. As the Omo River shares a divide with the Blue Nile
and with tributaries of the White Nile, the Nile and the Omo must
be affected similarly. As noted, deposition of each of the members of
the Kibish Formation was probably very rapid. Thus, the close
correspondence between the ages of Member I (196 kyr) and of
sapropel S7 (195 kyr), of Member III (104 kyr) and of sapropel S4
(102 kyr), and of Member IV (3.3–9.5 kyr) and of sapropel S1
(8 kyr) is probably causally related. Sapropel S2 (55 kyr) is absent
from or poorly represented in many Mediterranean sedimentary
cores and has a very small d18O residual; thus, it is not surprising
that no deposits of this age have been identiﬁed in the Kibish
Formation. Sapropel S6, deposited during a European glacial
period19, might also be absent from the Kibish Formation, because
it too has a small d18O anomaly. The two parts of Member II may be
accommodated by sapropels S5 and S6, or they may correspond to
the two phases identiﬁed in sapropel S5 (119–124 kyr), which are
separated by 700–900 yr (ref. 20). This link between sapropel
formation in the Mediterranean and very high levels of Lake
Turkana is a particularly notable ﬁnding. In contrast, S3 is very
well represented in many Mediterranean sedimentary cores and is

therefore expected to be recorded in the Kibish Formation, but has
not been recognized. Given the large expanse of the plain in the
region underlain by the Kibish Formation, it is quite possible that
deposits correlative with sapropel S3 are present but are not exposed
in the immediate Kibish region that we have studied.
Our palaeontological and stratigraphic studies support the
original report14 that Omo I and Omo II are derived from compar-
able stratigraphic levels within Member I of the Kibish Formation
despite their morphological differences1–3,21,22. Morphological
diversity among fossil hominids from the Middle and Late Pleisto-
cene of Africa is of major importance in understanding the tempo
and mode of modern human origins21,23.
40Ar/39Ar dating of feldspars from tuffs in Member I and Member
III of the Kibish Formation shows that its hominid fossils are
younger than 195.8 ^ 1.6 kyr and older than 103.7 ^ 0.9 kyr.
Direct isotopic dating of volcanic eruptions recorded in the Kibish
Formation does not enable us to place narrower limits on the age.
However, the suggested correlations of Member IIa and Member IIb
with either the two identiﬁed phases of sapropel S5 or sapropels S6
and S5, respectively, indicate that deposition of Member I of the
Kibish Formation occurred earlier than about 125 kyr ago or earlier
than 172 kyr ago. The geological evidence for rapid deposition of
Member I and the remarkably close correspondence of the isotopic
ages on the youngest pumice clasts in the tuff of Member I at 196 kyr
with the estimated age of sapropel S7 is regarded as strongly
supporting the view that Member I was deposited close to
196 ^ 2 kyr ago. On this basis we suggest that hominid fossils
Omo I and Omo II are relatively securely dated to 195 ^ 5 kyr old,
somewhat older than the age of between 154 and 160 kyr assigned
to the hominid fossils from Herto, Ethiopia24, making Omo I and
Omo II the oldest anatomically modern human fossils yet
recovered.

Methods
Age measurements
Alkali feldspar crystals were separated from pumice clasts and cleaned ultrasonically in 7%
HF for 5–10 min to remove adhering volcanic glass and surface alteration. Although
separations were performed on the coarsest crystals present, in several cases crystals were
less than 1 mm, with masses less than 0.8 mg. In such cases several crystals were used for
each analysis (see Supplementary Tables 2–4).
Samples were irradiated in facilities X33 or X34 of the High Flux Australian Reactor
(Lucas Heights, Sydney, Australia) for 6 h as described in ref. 25. Cadmium shielding
0.2 mm thick was used to reduce the (40Ar/39Ar)K correction factor, which was measured
by analysis of zero-aged synthetic potassium silicate glass co-irradiated with the
unknowns. This correction is particularly important because of the young age of the
samples, so interpolated values for each sample are given in the Supplementary Tables 2–4.
The ﬂuence monitor employed was sanidine 92-176, separated from the Fish Canyon Tuff,
with a reference age of 28.1 Myr (ref. 26).
After irradiation, feldspar crystals were loaded into wells in a copper sample tray,
installed in the vacuum system and baked overnight. Samples were fused with a focused
argon-ion laser beam with up to 10 W of power. After puriﬁcation of the gases released
during fusion, the argon was analysed isotopically in a VG3600 mass spectrometer, using a
Daly collector. The overall sensitivity of the systemwas about 2.5 £ 10217 mol mV21. Mass
discrimination was monitored through regular measurements of atmospheric argon. The
irradiation parameter, J, for each unknown was derived by interpolation from the
measurements made on the ﬂuence monitor crystals, with at least ﬁve analyses per level;
the precision generally was in the range 0.3–0.75%, standard deviation of the population.
Calcium correction factors27 used in all calculations were (36Ar/37Ar)Ca ¼ 3.49 £ 1024
and (39Ar/37Ar)Ca ¼ 7.86 £ 1024.
Data handling
In calculating the arithmetic mean age for each pumice clast, any result more than two
standard deviations from the initial mean of each sample was rejected iteratively until no
further outliers were identiﬁed. No more than two measurements were rejected in any
group of analyses, and no results were rejected for about half the groups. The error quoted
in Table 1 is the standard deviation of the population, but because uncertainties on
individual ages are variable, a weighted mean age and error is also given, weighting each
age by the inverse of the variance. Differences in these mean ages are small (Table 1), but
the error of the weighted mean age is usually much lower. In addition, data from each
pumice clast, after exclusion of outliers, were plotted in an isotope correlation diagram
(36Ar/40Ar versus 39Ar/40Ar), using the York28 procedure. The derived ages are quite close
to the mean ages (Table 1), and the calculated trapped argon composition generally has the
atmospheric argon ratio of 295.5, within uncertainty.
