Action-Video-Game Experience
Alters the Spatial Resolution of
Vision

ABSTRACT—Playing action video games enhances several
different aspects of visual processing; however, the mech-
anisms underlying this improvement remain unclear. Here
we show that playing action video games can alter fun-
damental characteristics of the visual system, such as the
spatial resolution of visual processing across the visual
ﬁeld. To determine the spatial resolution of visual pro-
cessing, we measured the smallest distance a distractor
could be from a target without compromising target iden-
tiﬁcation. This approach exploits the fact that visual
processing is hindered as distractors are brought close to
the target, a phenomenon known as crowding. Compared
with nonplayers, action-video-game players could tolerate
smaller target-distractor distances. Thus, the spatial
resolution of visual processing is enhanced in this popu-
lation. Critically, similar effects were observed in non-vid-
eo-game players who were trained on an action video
game; this result veriﬁes a causative relationship between
video-game play and augmented spatial resolution.
Video-game players appear to outperform non-game players on
several different visual tasks (Castel, Pratt, & Drummond, 2005;
Gopher, Weil, & Bareket, 1994; Green & Bavelier, 2003, 2006a,
2006b; Greenﬁeld, DeWinstanley, Kilpatrick, & Kaye, 1994;
Trick, Jaspers-Fayer, & Sethi, 2005). For example, avid action-
video-game players (VGPs) were found to localize a peripheral
target in a ﬁeld of distracting objects more accurately than non-
action-video-game players (NVGPs), as well as to process a
visual stream of briefly presented objects more efﬁciently and to
track more objects at once than NVGPs. NVGPs trained on an
action video game exhibited similar improvements, establishing
that the very act of playing an action video game results in an
increased ability to perform such complex visual tasks (Green &
Bavelier, 2003, 2006b). Although the effect of game play on
performance of complex visual tasks is striking, it remains un-
clear whether the improvements are mainly due to strategic
changes or to changes in more fundamental aspects of visual
processing. Using a crowding paradigm, we show here that vid-
eo-game play alters the spatial resolution of vision—one of the
fundamental characteristics of vision.
Crowding refers to the general phenomenon that it is sub-
stantially more difﬁcult to identify a target object when other
distracting objects are present in its immediate vicinity than
when the target object is presented in isolation. This decrement
in performance is a function of the number of distractors and
their distance from the target, with performance decreasing as
the number of distractors increases, as well as when targets and
distractors are moved closer together (Leat, Li, & Epp, 1999;
Miller, 1991; Orbach & Wilson, 1999). The region in space
around a target where the presence of distracting objects leads to
decreased sensitivity for the target is known as the crowding
region or the zone of spatial interaction (Bouma, 1970; Flom,
Weymouth, & Kahneman, 1963; Intriligator & Cavanagh, 2001;
Jacobs, 1979; Toet & Levi, 1992). In everyday life, crowding
performance limits the ability to identify letters or words em-
bedded in text, for example.
Several lines of explanation for visual crowding have been
advanced. Some researchers have suggested important roles for
interactions between the facilitatory and inhibitory regions
within neuronal receptive ﬁelds in early visual areas or inter-
actions between neurons via long-range horizontal connections
(Flom, Heath, & Takahashi, 1963; Polat & Sagi, 1994; Tripathy
& Levi, 1994). Others have suggested that crowding, particu-
larly foveal crowding, is a form of spatial-frequency masking or
contrast masking (Chung, Levi, & Legge, 2001; Levi, Klein, &
Hariharan, 2002) or is related to the physical properties of the
stimulus (Hess, Dakin, & Kapoor, 2000). Alternatively, it has

been proposed that the size of the crowding region offers a
measure of the resolution of visual attention (Intriligator &
Cavanagh, 2001; Tripathy & Cavanagh, 2002). But whichever
interpretation of crowding may prevail, all parties agree that
crowding reﬂects a fundamental limitation on the spatial reso-
lution of the visual system.
In the experiments reported in this article, we tested the hy-
pothesis that playing action video games leads to enhanced
spatial resolution, by using a crowding paradigm modeled after
that of Toet and Levi (1992). Experiment 1 establishes that avid
VGPs exhibit smaller crowding regions than NVGPs, meaning
that VGPs maintain high performance at target-distractor sep-
arations that hinder NVGPs’ performance. In Experiment 2, we
used a training paradigm to demonstrate a causative relation-
ship between action-video-game experience and performance in
a visual task.
EXPERIMENT 1
If spatial resolution is enhanced in VGPs, the size of the
crowding region should be smaller in VGPs than in NVGPs. We
measured the size of the crowding region by testing the ability of
participants to discriminate between a right-side-up and an
upside-down T shape as a function of the distance between this
target object and two ﬂanking distractor T shapes presented
above and below the target (Fig. 1; Toet & Levi, 1992). The size
of the crowding region was assessed at three different eccen-
tricities (01, 101, and 251) chosen to allow the measurement of
potential changes both well within (01 and 101) and just at the
limit of (251) the ﬁeld of view of normal game playing (most of our
gamers reported playing on screens that subtended an average of
!151 from the center of the screen). If changes in the size of the
crowding region do arise as a result of action-video-game
experience, but the learning is specific to the trained region
of space, one would predict greater enhancements for 01 and
101 than for 251. Conversely, if similar changes were observed
across eccentricities, this would be evidence for generalization
of the learning beyond the more highly trained regions of
space.
Method
Subjects
Twenty right-handed males (all undergraduates at the University
of Rochester) with normal or corrected-to-normal vision were
placed into one of two groups, VGP or NVGP, on the basis of the
outcome of an interview about their video-game playing habits
(only males were tested in Experiment 1 because of the relative
scarcity of female VGPs). For each of several different types of
video games (action, sports, fantasy, role-playing, other), par-
ticipants were asked to name all the games they had played in
the past 12 months. For each video game participants reported
playing, they were asked how often they played that game in the
previous 12 months (daily, weekly, monthly or less), how long
they played it during a typical session, and, if applicable,
how many hours they played it per week (0, 0–1, 1–2, 3–5, 5–10,
101).
To be considered a VGP, a subject needed to report a min-
imum of 5 hr a week of action-video-game usage for the previous
6 months (N 5 10, mean age 5 19.7 years). The criterion to be
considered an NVGP was a report of 0 hr per week of action-
game play for at least the previous 6 months (N 5 10, mean age
5 20.3 years; note: subjects in this group could play other kinds
of video games). Subjects provided written informed consent to
participate and were paid $8 per hour.
Apparatus
The apparatus consisted of a Macintosh G3 computer running a
program to present stimuli and collect the data using the Matlab
computer language (The Math Works Inc., Natick, MA) and the
Psychophysics Toolbox routines (Brainard, 1997; Pelli, 1997).
The stimuli were displayed on a 24-in. Sony GDM-FW900
driven at a resolution of 1920 " 1440 pixels at 75 Hz by
an MP850 video card (Village Tronic Computer, Sarstedt,
Germany).
Stimuli
The stimuli and procedure were modeled after those of Toet and
Levi (1992; Fig. 1). The stimuli consisted of three vertically
aligned T shapes formed by black pixels (3 cd/m2). The shapes
had a stroke width of 2 pixels and were presented either right
Fig. 1. Illustration of the test stimuli. The stimuli consisted of three T
shapes randomly oriented either right side up or upside down. The
subject’s task was to indicate the orientation of the center T. In separate
blocks, three eccentricities were tested—01, 101, and 251. The size of the
Ts was set to be 1.5 times each individual subject’s T-alone threshold at
each eccentricity.

side up or upside down against a uniform white background (70
cd/m2). For each eccentricity tested, the size of the Ts was set to
1.5 times each individual subject’s T-alone discrimination
threshold. The T-alone discrimination threshold was derived by
averaging the threshold obtained in two blocks in which the
T was presented in isolation.
Viewing Conditions
The three eccentricities tested, 01, 101, and 251, called for three
different viewing distances (300 cm, 90 cm, and 50 cm, re-
spectively). For the two peripheral conditions, the stimuli were
always centered on the horizontal meridian to the right of ﬁxa-
tion, and we used an eyetracker to enforce ﬁxation. The eye-
tracking analysis was conducted off-line; thus, trials in which an
eye movement occurred could not be removed from the ﬁnal
analyses. However, the number of eye movements made was
quite low (< 4% of trials) and did not differ between groups (F <
1) or among eccentricities (F < 1). Each eccentricity was pre-
sented in a separate block, and the order of the blocks was
counterbalanced across subjects. No effect of run order was
found, and we do not discuss this variable further.
Procedure
Each trial began with a short auditory tone followed by a 150-ms
interstimulus interval. For the 01 stimulus, the ﬁxation dot was
extinguished during this interval to diminish any possible for-
ward masking. For the two peripheral conditions, the ﬁxation dot
remained visible throughout the trial. The stimuli were then
presented for 100 ms. The task was to indicate the orientation
(up/down) of the center T by pressing the corresponding key on
the keyboard. Subjects were free to respond at any time fol-
lowing stimulus presentation and were told that accuracy rather
than speed of response was critical. Following response, audi-
tory feedback was given (low tone for an incorrect response and
high tone for a correct response).
The critical manipulation was the center-to-center spacing
between the two ﬂanking Ts and the target T (initial spacing was
30, 400, and 600 min of arc for the 01, 101, and 251 conditions,
respectively), which was controlled by a three-up, one-down
staircase (step size of 5%). We did not end the staircase pro-
cedure after a certain number of reversals; rather, to ensure that
subjects were given equal experience (as three different ec-
centricities were tested and compared), we had all subjects
complete 200 trials per condition. The ﬁnal crowding-threshold
value was calculated by averaging the center-to-center target-
distractor spacing across the ﬁnal 10 trials.
Results and Discussion
The crowding threshold varied from approximately 10 min of arc
for the 01 condition, to 120 min of arc at 101, to more than 300
min of arc for the 251 condition. The ﬁnding that the crowding
region increased dramatically with eccentricity mirrors previous
reports in the ﬁeld (Leat et al., 1999; Toet & Levi, 1992). To be
able to compare the effect of video-game experience across
eccentricities, we ﬁrst converted the distance thresholds to log10
values, thus allowing a relative equalization of the means and
variances across conditions (Leat et al., 1999).
The effects of VGP status (VGP, NVGP) and eccentricity (01,
101, 251) were analyzed in a 2 " 3 analysis of variance (ANOVA)
run on log distance thresholds. A main effect of eccentricity was
observed, F(2, 36) 5 331.7, prep > .99, Zp
2 ¼ :95, with the size
of the crowding region increasing with increasing eccentricity,
as expected. A main effect of VGP status was also observed, F(1,
18) 5 22.4, prep > .99, Zp
2 ¼ :55, with VGPs demonstrating
smaller crowding regions than NVGPs (Fig. 2a). Eccentricity did
not interact with VGP status (F < 1), which suggests that the
effect of VGP status was consistent across the eccentricities
tested.
Although our primary goal was to ascertain the size of the
crowding zones in VGPs and NVGPs, another interesting pattern
of results was observed in the T-alone condition. A 2 (VGP
status: VGP, NVGP) " 3 (eccentricity: 01, 101, 251) ANOVA
on log10 transformed values of these thresholds revealed, as
expected, a main effect of eccentricity, F(2, 36) 5 412.6, prep >
.99, Zp
2 ¼ :96, with the size of the Tat threshold increasing with
increasing eccentricity. Unexpectedly, though, a main effect of
VGP status was also observed, F(1, 18) 5 15.9, prep > .99,
Zp
2 ¼ :47, with VGPs being able to discriminate smaller Ts than
NVGPs. VGP status did not interact with eccentricity, F(2, 36)
5 1.2, prep < .65, which suggests the effect was consistent across
the eccentricities tested.
Together, these results demonstrate that VGPs have both
smaller regions of spatial interaction and better visual acuity
thresholds than NVGPs. It is worth noting that the performance
improvement seen in gamers was consistent across all eccen-
tricities tested. A difference between groups at 01 is somewhat
surprising as it is generally assumed that foveal vision is near
optimal, and therefore more difﬁcult to enhance through training
than peripheral vision (Neville & Bavelier, 2002). Nonetheless,
the present study establishes a central performance enhance-
ment of a magnitude comparable to that observed in the per-
iphery. In addition, the presence of a group difference at 251 of
eccentricity suggests that some transfer of learning had oc-
curred, as this eccentricity was not within the well-trained re-
gion of space. If this improvement were found to be truly due
to experience with action video games, this effect would be
unexpected because the perceptual learning literature has
demonstrated exquisite spatial speciﬁcity for learning in many
training tasks (Fahle, 2004, 2005; Karni & Sagi, 1991).
Before any conclusions about the effects of action-video-game
experience can be reached, self-selection needs to be ruled out
as a contributing factor. It is possible that by selecting avid game
players, we chose a population that would have superior visual
skills even without the difference in training. It may be, for
example, that individuals with better visual skills are more

likely to excel at game playing and therefore more likely to
become avid players.
EXPERIMENT 2
Experiment 2 employed a training paradigm to investigate
whether a causative relationship exists between action-video-
game experience and enhanced spatial resolution. Thirty-two
nongamers were divided into two training groups. One group was
then trained on an action game that was similar to the games
played by the VGPs in Experiment 1, whereas the other was
trained on a game that was less visually intense, but that did
require substantial visuomotor coordination. In addition to
controlling for any effects of improved visuomotor coordination
(better hand-eye coordination could conceivably reduce the
resources necessary for response execution, leaving more re-
sources free for target identiﬁcation), the control group acted as
a control for test-retest improvements (improvements due to
practice on the tests themselves) and for any Hawthorne-like
effects (improvements due to the fact that the experimenters had
‘‘paid attention’’ to the subjects during the training—Benson,
2001). Crowding thresholds were measured before and after
training (30 hr of training over a span of 4–6 weeks). If action-
video-game experience is sufﬁcient to cause a decrease in the
size of the crowding region, a greater reduction in threshold
would be expected in the group trained on the action game than
in the control group.
Method
Subjects
Thirty-two NVGPs were equally and randomly divided between
the experimental and control groups. The criteria for being
considered an NVGP were the same as in Experiment 1. All
subjects underwent training as described in this section. In all, 8
females and 8 males (mean age 5 21.3; all right-handed) made
up the ﬁnal experimental group; the ﬁnal control group consisted
of 9 females and 7 males (mean age 5 21.0, 15 right-handed).
Testing: Apparatus, Stimuli, and Procedure
The apparatus, stimuli, and procedure were identical to those in
Experiment 1 with three exceptions. First, because subjects
underwent several unrelated experiments, the total testing du-
ration was minimized, and thus only one T-alone block was
completed prior to the experimental block. Second, to decrease
running time, we set the step size of the change in Tsize at 20%
until three reversals were observed and then decreased the step
size to 5%, allowing stable thresholds to be reached in 120 trials.
Finally, because no effect of run order was found in Experiment
1, the three eccentricities were run in a ﬁxed order: 01, 101, and
251. Eye movements were again measured for the two peripheral
conditions and, as in Experiment 1, were quite rare (approxi-
mately 3% of trials); they did not differ as a function of test
(pretest, posttest), trained game (action game, control game), or
eccentricity, nor were there interactions between any of these
variables.
Training: Apparatus, Stimuli, and Procedure
For both groups, training consisted of playing the predetermined
video game for a total of 30 hr (maximum of 2 hr per day, min-
imum of 5 hr per week, maximum of 8 hr per week). The 16
members of the experimental group played the game Unreal
Tournament 2004 (henceforth referred to as the action video

game). This game was chosen because it is similar to the games
played by the VGPs in Experiment 1; it has a relatively simple
interface, uses ﬁrst-person point of view, and requires effective
monitoring of the entire visual ﬁeld (extent from ﬁxation: about
131 high " 161 wide). Each 1-hr session of play was divided into
three 20-min blocks. The difﬁculty of each block was adjusted
on the basis of the kill/death ratio. If in a block the player scored
more than twice as many kills as deaths, the difﬁculty of the next
block was increased one level. Also, players were periodically
retested on levels of lower difﬁculty to assess improvement
quantitatively.
The 16 members of the control group played the game Tetris,
which was displayed to cover the entire extent of the screen
(extent from ﬁxation: 181 high " 131 wide). Thus, the ﬁeld of
view of the Tetris game was slightly larger than that of the action
game. Tetris was selected to control for the effect of improved
visuomotor coordination while minimizing the processing of
multiple objects at once. Accordingly, the version of Tetris on
which subjects were trained had the preview-block option
turned off. Improvement was measured quantitatively by com-
paring performance on Day 1 and Day 30.
The groups played their respective games on 20-in. monitors.
The action-game group played on Dell FlatPanel displays,
whereas the control group played on CRT monitors.
Results and Discussion
Game Play
Improvement in game play was assessed using several measures.
For the action game, the two measures were kills and deaths. For
each of ﬁve levels of game difﬁculty (Level 5 being the highest
level that all players attained), the measures taken on subjects’
ﬁrst playing of the level (which, because of the way in which
difﬁculty was increased, was not necessarily on the 1st day of
training) were compared with the measures taken on their ﬁnal
playing of the level on Days 29 and 30. Number of kills in-
creased substantially and number of deaths decreased sub-
stantially at each difﬁculty level (Level 1: 226% increase in
kills, 64% decrease in deaths; Level 2: 147%, 38%; Level 3:
160%, 27%; Level 4: 80%, 33%; Level 5: 52%, 32%).
For the control game, the mean and median scores from Day 1
and Day 30 were compared. As did the action-game players, the
control players showed substantial improvements after training,
the mean score improving by 323% and the median score by
359%.
These results demonstrate that both groups were engaged in
their training and showed improvement on the training task.
Crowding Thresholds
As in Experiment 1, the crowding thresholds were converted to
log10 values before analysis. A 2 " 2 " 3 ANOVA with trained
game (action, control), test (pretest, posttest), and eccentricity
(01, 101, 251) as factors yielded a strong main effect of eccen-
tricity, F(2, 60) 5 2,506.5, prep > .99, Zp
2 ¼ :98, with crowding
thresholds increasing with increasing eccentricity. A main effect
of test was also observed, F(1, 30) 5 4.8, prep 5 .93, Zp
2 ¼ :14,
with crowding thresholds being lower at posttest than pretest.
The significant interaction between trained game and test, F(1,
30) 5 11.6, prep 5 .99, Zp
2 ¼ :28, conﬁrmed the results from
Experiment 1: The action group showed larger decreases in
crowding threshold from pretest to posttest than the control
group did (Figs. 2b and 2c, respectively). This effect did not
interact with eccentricity (F < 1), which suggests that the effect
of training was similar across the eccentricities tested.
Unlike in Experiment 1, in which VGPs showed lower
thresholds than NVGPs, no effect of trained game or test was
detected in the T-alone data in Experiment 2. Only a main effect
of eccentricity was observed, F(2, 60) 5 918.8, prep > .99; as is
typical, thresholds increased with increasing eccentricity.
The results of Experiment 2 establish that subjects trained on
an action video game exhibit significantly greater decreases in
crowding threshold than subjects trained on a control game.
Unlike in Experiment 1, visual acuity (T-alone threshold) was
not detectably modiﬁed by training on an action video game.
Although it is unclear at this point whether more then 30 hr of
training could produce a reliable change in visual acuity, Ex-
periment 2 unambiguously demonstrates that visual crowding
can be altered through action-video-game training.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Action-video-game experience was shown to lead to an increase
in the spatial resolution of vision as measured by crowding.
VGPs could tolerate smaller center-to-center spacing between
target and distractors than could NVGPs. This improvement was
noted not only at peripheral locations, but also in central vision,
indicating that even the high central resolution can be enhanced
with proper training. In addition, improvements in the periphery
were seen not only at locations well within the range of playing,
but also at more eccentric locations; this result indicates transfer
of training beyond the highly trained regions of space. NVGPs
specifically trained on an action video game for 30 hr showed
similar improvement in the size of the visual crowding region;
this ﬁnding establishes a causative relationship between video-
game experience and reduction in the size of the crowding
region. Thus, video-game play may alter basic properties of the
visual system.
This study extends previous ﬁndings on the impact of video-
game and visual skills by showing that video-game play can alter
visual performance even in a task in which the location and time
of arrival of the stimulus are ﬁxed and known ahead of time to the
subject. In contrast, previous work in gamers focused on com-
plex visual tasks that by design relied on uncertainty, such as
visual search tasks in which the target location is uncertain and
has to be found. Although the ﬁnding that video-game play
changes performance on such complex visual tasks is interest-
92

ing, a number of other manipulations are known to affect per-
formance on such tasks as well. For example, much previous
research documents that visual spatial resolution is enhanced
when exogenous cues are used to reduce spatial and temporal
uncertainty (Carrasco, Williams, & Yeshurun, 2002; Yeshurun
& Carrasco, 1999) and that performance is impaired when a
difﬁcult secondary task is added (Zenger, Braun, & Koch, 2000).
In the present study, VGPs demonstrated reductions in crowding
thresholds even though where and when the stimulus would
appear was ﬁxed, and subjects could therefore focus at their
optimal level. The ﬁnding of improved performance under such
conditions cannot easily be attributed to strategic factors. Rath-
er, one of the mechanisms by which action-video-game play may
enhance visual processing is by increasing the spatial resolution
of visual processing across the visual ﬁeld.
The present study highlights the potential of action-video-
game training for rehabilitation of visual deficits. Indeed, a
common feature in visually impaired patients is increased vul-
nerability to crowding, as is seen in amblyopia or normal aging
(Ball, Beard, Roenker, Miller, & Griggs, 1988; Ball & Owsley,
1992; Hariharan, Levi, & Klein, 2005; Levi, Hariharan, &
Klein, 2002; Levi & Klein, 1985; Polat, Sagi, & Norcia, 1997).
Of course, much work remains to characterize the level (or
levels) of processing at which video-game playing may act;
however, by establishing that a video-game training regimen can
reduce the detrimental effects of crowding, this research opens
new avenues for the development of rehabilitation software.
