Abstract
The adaptive immune system (AIS) in mammals, which is centred on lymphocytes bearing antigen
receptors that are generated by somatic recombination, arose approximately 500 million years ago
in jawed fish. This intricate defence system consists of many molecules, mechanisms and tissues
that are not present in jawless vertebrates. Two macroevolutionary events are believed to have
contributed to the genesis of the AIS: the emergence of the recombination-activating gene (RAG)
transposon, and two rounds of whole-genome duplication. It has recently been discovered that a
non-RAG-based AIS with similarities to the jawed vertebrate AIS — including two lymphoid cell
lineages — arose in jawless fish by convergent evolution. We offer insights into the latest
advances in this field and speculate on the selective pressures that led to the emergence and
maintenance of the AIS.
The adaptive immune system (AIS) is fascinating to both scientists and laymen: we have a
specific yet incredibly diverse system that can fight myriad pathogens and has a ‘memory’
— the basis of vaccination — that enables a rapid response to previously encountered
pathogens. The complexity of immune response regulation rivals that of the nervous system
in terms of the connections forged and suppressed between cells, but immune cells must also
traverse the body through blood, lymph and tissue until they encounter invading organisms.
How did such a system arise, and can studies of non-mammalian vertebrates help us to
understand the immunity gestalt?
Antibodies were discovered over 100 years ago, and major questions relating to the
generation of diversity were solved in the 1970s with the detection of somatic
hypermutation1 and variable–diversity–joining rearrangement (VDJ rearrangement)2 of
antibody (or immunoglobulin (Ig) or B cell receptor (BCR)) genes. In the 1980s, T cell
receptors (TCRs) were discovered and there was universal agreement that they shared a
common ancestor with BCR genes, based on their similar domain organization and reliance
on the same rearrangement mechanism to generate diversity3. After the discovery of
enzymes that are involved in the rearrangement of BCR and TCR genes4 and of

hypermutation of BCR genes5, attention shifted to asking how a system that is capable of
generating such diversity evolved. Jawed fish were found to have almost all of these genes
and mechanisms, but jawless fish (Agnathans) apparently had none. This mystifying finding
led to the ‘big bang’ theory of AIS emergence6, which is one of the main topics of this
Review.
The discovery in jawless fish of a lymphoid cell-based system of adaptive immunity that is
strikingly similar to the system in jawed fish was a total surprise7. The system in jawless
fish is similar to VDJ rearrangement but has rearranging receptors that are encoded by
another gene family — the variable lymphocyte receptor (VLR) family. We discuss the
compelling possibility that the VLR rearrangement process is under the control of the same
family of enzymes that are responsible for somatic hypermutation of BCR genes8, which
pushes the origins of acquired immunity back to the ancestor of all vertebrates. However,
despite this new finding of adaptive immunity in jawless fish, the ‘big bang’ theory
concerning the origin and rapid development of the highly complex BCR- and TCR-based
AIS remains intact.
In this Review, we describe the basic features of BCRs, TCRs and the major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) and stress their preservation and modification over
evolutionary time. We then discuss the two catastrophic, innovative events behind the ‘big
bang’ origins of the BCR–TCR–MHC-based AIS — the recombinationactivating gene
(RAG) transposon invasion and genomewide duplications early in vertebrate history — and
we discuss the new type of AIS that has been discovered in jawless fish. Finally, we
speculate on the origins of adaptive immunity in all vertebrates, emphasizing the lessons we
have learned from extant immune systems.
The AIS of jawed vertebrates
The most evolutionarily ancient extant organisms in which the AIS, as defined in humans, is
found are the cartilaginous fish. It is believed to have arisen in the first jawed vertebrates
(gnathostomes) — the placoderms (FIG. 1). Components of the innate immune system, for
example, pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) — including the Toll-like receptors (TLRs),
nod-like receptors (nLRs) and scavenger receptors (SRs) — are found throughout the animal
kingdom (FIG. 1). In some invertebrates, such as the sea urchin9, and in many plants10 there
has been a great expansion of PRR families, which suggests that in the absence of an AIS,
complex innate mechanisms might be required for defence.
Lymphoid cells — the core of the AIS — are first found in pre-vertebrate deuterostomes
(that is, these are the most evolutionarily ancient living phylogenetic group in which
lymphoid cells can be found). The AIS requires a large population of cells in each individual
to permit clonal selection of cells with receptors specific for a particular pathogen. Large-
bodied vertebrates were the first organisms to fulfil this requirement (FIG. 1). Here, we
discuss important features of the AIS in jawed vertebrates and consider their conservation or
plasticity over evolutionary time. The concept of plasticity was first proposed by Klein and
colleagues in the context of MHC molecules11, but can be extended to all features of the
AIS.
B cell receptors
Immunoglobulin M
Like most molecules of the AIS as defined in humans, among living animals Igs are first
found in cartilaginous fish (sharks, skates, rays and chimaeras or ratfish) and are generated
by a somatic recombination mechanism. Their evolutionary features are summarized in FIG.

2a. IgM is the most ancient antibody class and has the same function in all
gnathostomes12.The transmembrane form of IgM defines the B cell lineage. After B cell
stimulation — by an antigen and cognate interactions from T cells — this isotype is secreted
into the plasma as a multimeric protein. In bony fish, IgM is secreted as a tetramer in
different reduction or oxidation states that seem to modify the binding strength of the
antibodies13. In cartilaginous fish, IgM is an abundant secreted monomer; this secretion
correlates with a switch to a higher affinity response14. It is not known whether a cell
programmed to produce multimeric IgM switches to produce the monomeric form or
whether sharks have lineages of B cells that are specialized to make either the multimeric or
monomeric Ig. Despite these modifications in fish, IgM is generally evolutionarily
conserved.
Immunoglobulin D
The function of IgD remains poorly understood. It had generally been thought to be an
evolutionary newcomer, probably arising in mammals (FIG. 2a), but the detection in bony
fish15 and frogs16,17 of an Ig isotype that resembles IgD showed that this is not the case
(FIG. 2b). Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses suggest that another isotype in cartilaginous
fish and some bony fish, IgW18–20, is related to IgD. Therefore, an IgD-like isotype was
present in the ancestor of all gnathostomes. In frogs and mammals, IgD/IgW occurs
predominantly in the transmembrane form, but in bony fish there are high levels of secreted
IgD, which is mostly bound to the surface of granulocytes. This work in fish prompted a
recent re-examination of the function of IgD in humans, and it was found that the secreted
form of IgD is bound to the surface of basophils and has strong proinflammatory
properties21. Therefore, although this new study does not address the function of cell-surface
IgD, the work in fish heralded an entirely new understanding of secretory IgD function in
humans. Like IgM, IgD is an ancient antibody class, but unlike IgM, it has been
extraordinarily malleable in structure and (presumably) in function over evolutionary time.
Other immunoglobulins
Besides IgM and IgD, mammals have three Ig isotypes: IgG, which is involved in high-
affinity memory responses; Ige, which functions in inflammatory (and allergic) responses at
epithelial surfaces; and the mucosal antibody IgA (FIG. 2a). IgG and Ige originate from an
isotype known as IgY, which is first found in amphibians and has the same function as IgG
(at least in frogs and birds17,22). Shorter forms of IgY, which are formed either by
alternative splicing or from separate genes, are present in multiple taxa; these short forms
are believed to neutralize pathogens without activation of inflammatory responses. IgA is
found first in reptiles and seems to serve the same functions in all animals. Interestingly, in
lower taxa, other isotypes — for example, IgX in frogs23 — provide mucosal immunity.
Finally, in camelids, there is a modified form of IgG that does not associate with light (L)
chains, and its V regions are free to interact with antigens; a similar form called
immunoglobulin new antigen receptor (IgnAR) is found in cartilaginous fish; the IgnAR V
region is also conserved in some TCRs24,25 (see below). In summary, in evolutionary terms
all vertebrates have multiple isotypes that provide distinct effector functions. Amphibians
are the most primitive class, with a classical memory response that is based on isotype
switching to IgG and IgY after antigen stimulation.
B cell receptor light chains
It was previously believed that the two isotypes of the BCR L chains in humans —λ and κ
— arose late in evolution, probably in the mammalian lineage (FIGS 2,3a). However,
genome and eST projects and studies of model vertebrate species have shown that these two
isotypes emerged in the common ancestor of all living vertebrates26–29. Furthermore,
another L chain — identified in frogs and named σ30 — also arose early in evolution and has

been retained in all cold-blooded gnathostomes. The reason(s) for the emergence and
maintenance of multiple L chains is (are) not known, but it might be related to the formation
of specific binding sites by particular combinations of L chains and heavy (H) chains.
B cell receptor heavy chains
From bony fish to mammals, BCR H chain genes are arranged in a so-called translocon
organization (FIGS 2b,3a): multiple V genes occur upstream of multiple D and J segments,
followed by single genes that encode the different constant (C) regions. The primary H chain
repertoire is generated by rearrangement in the primary lymphoid tissues (for example, bone
marrow), which involves a single V gene (out of tens to hundreds of V genes) being
rearranged to the downstream D and J segments31. In some species, such as chickens and
rabbits, after the rearrangement of a single V gene, gene conversion events involving nearby
non-functional V genes generate diversity in the primary repertoire32,33. In cartilaginous
fish, the Ig genes are in a cluster configuration with a single V, D, J and C gene in each
cluster34. RAG-mediated rearrangement occurs within a cluster, but diversity is generated
by junctional diversity at the V–D, D–D and D–J rearrangement joints and by somatic
hypermutation after antigenic stimulation of B cells35–37. The situation is similar for the L
chain genes, except they lack D segments (FIG. 2b). Also, in bony fish the L chain genes
can occur in translocon organization or cluster organization; this suggests that extensive
receptor editing — that is, re-rearrangement of BCR genes — can occur for L chain genes in
all fish38–41 (FIG. 2b).
The H chain class switch first evolved in amphibians, which have a mammalian-like Ig H
chain locus. In bony fish, the Ig H chain isotypes IgM and IgD are generated by alternative
splicing. The recently discovered IgT isotype is generated by alternative rearrangement: the
IgT D, J and C gene segments are located between the V genes and the IgM and IgD D, J
and C segments42,43 (FIG. 2b), and rearrangement that joins V genes to the IgM D segments
deletes the IgT genes, a situation similar to that at the αδ TCR locus. There is no switching
apparent between clusters in cartilaginous fish, neither within the IgM class nor between the
IgM and cartilaginous fish-specific IgnAR/IgW classes.
Amphibians, which have class switching and IgY, mark a major transition from the AIS in
fish. A single B cell has the capacity to modify the effector function of its secreted molecule
and to provide a memory response. In sharks, a ‘switch’ at the biochemical level from
multimeric to monomeric IgM provides at least some of the functions of an IgG — for
example, the capacity to enter extravascular sites — and an increase in affinity, but the
memory response is clearly inferior to that of the higher vertebrates.
T cell receptors
αβ T cell receptors
αβ TCRs recognize both the antigen (in the form of a peptide) and the MHC class I or II
molecule to which it is bound. This is known as major histocompatibility complex
restriction (MHC restriction)44. T cells develop in the thymus, and the basic evolution of the
thymus and T cell development is conserved for all gnathostomes, except in some species in
which the system seems to have degenerated (FIG. 1 and see below). A translocon
organization of both the α and β TCR genes is found in all animals (FIG. 2b). The presence
of a D segment in the β TCR locus and the absence of D segments and the presence of a
large number of J segments in the α TCR locus are also evolutionarily conserved, at least
from mammals to bony fish45 (FIG. 2b). The many J segments in the α locus allow
extensive receptor editing in developing T cells, resulting in greater opportunities for
modification of the antigen receptor, followed by potential selection of self-MHC-restricted
TCRs in the thymus46.

γδ T cell receptors
γδ TCRs are quite different from αβ TCRs. The basic gene organization is conserved in
gnathostomes, with only J segments in the γ gene, usually two D segments in the δ gene, and
a close linkage of the δ and α TCR genes. However, the receptor can be adapted in several
ways. It was shown in mice that γδ T cells that arose early in ontogeny bear invariant
receptors and home to sites, such as the skin, where they form a first line of defence and
self-renew for the life of the organism47. Similarly, in humans, T cells with canonical γδ
receptors make up a large percentage of lymphocytes in the blood and become highly
expanded upon infection. These cells respond to the metabolite isoprenylphosphate, which is
produced by all cells but is produced in a more immunogenic form by unicellular
pathogens48. The ‘innate-like’ γδ T cells can make up the majority of T cells in some
species, but in others γδ T cells do not bear canonical receptors, are a large proportion of the
T cells in the body, and seem to be more adaptive in nature49. The binding sites of these
receptors (even of some of the innate receptors) are more like BCR binding sites: they have
one long and one short complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3), whereas αβ TCRs
have similarly sized CDR3s for both chains50.
Recently, new types of δ TCR genes have been discovered in different vertebrate taxa. In
about a quarter of their δ TCR genes, sharks have a three-domain receptor chain with two
amino-terminal V domains and a membrane-proximal C domain called nAR-TCR51 (FIG.
2b). Both V domains are generated by VDJ rearrangement: the N-terminal domain is
encoded by an IgnAR-like cluster, and the other is generated by rearrangement of V to
canonical D and J elements. It is likely that this TCR chain recognizes antigens in a similar
way to the bona fide IgnAR, which is presumed to have a single-domain binding site. In
marsupials, the δ TCR locus has been duplicated. An apparently ancient trans rearrangement
of IgV regions to this locus in germ cells52 has resulted in one set of V, D and J segments
that rearrange in a cluster that is upstream of a pre-rearranged (that is, germline-joined) VDJ
gene. This is predicted to result in a three-domain TCR chain that has two V domains and
one C domain and is similar to the TCR chain in sharks (FIG. 2b). Although the function of
these receptors is not known, it is proposed that — unlike the MHC-restricted αβ TCRs —
they recognize soluble antigens, which would give them a similar function to Igs53.
Consistent with this idea, shark γ TCR genes have recently been shown to hypermutate like
BCR genes but unlike αβ TCR genes54. Therefore, a new paradigm emerging from the
comparative studies is that γδ TCRs probably have the capacity to interact with free antigens
in a similar way to Igs. Additionally, when comparing αβ TCRs and γδ TCRs, the former
clearly are the more evolutionarily conserved, probably because they are constrained by
MHC restriction. By contrast, γδ TCRs are more evolutionarily labile and have adaptive
immune and innate immune functions that differ even between vertebrates in the same class.
Major histocompatibility complex
The MHC is defined by: MHC class I and class II genes; genes that encode transporter
associated with antigen processing (TAP) and tapasin, which are involved in processing
antigens for presentation by MHC class I molecules; and genes that are involved in general
immunity (see below). The MHC, like TCRs and BCRs, is first found in cartilaginous fish55.
Genes involved in class I processing and presentation are closely linked in almost all
vertebrates (except in placental mammals, in which there is close linkage of the class I
processing genes and class II genes) and are believed to have co-evolved55,56. As described
below, genes that encode natural killer (nK) cell receptors are associated with the MHC of
various living vertebrates, and these serve as connections to what seems to have been a
primordial gene complex composed of receptors and ligands55,57,58. Therefore, it seems
likely that nK receptors (and perhaps also the forerunners of antigen receptors) were
physically linked to the primordial MHC in a similar way to the links between receptors and

ligands in the myriad histocompatibility systems of modern-day lower deuterostomes and
protostomes59; these links were subsequently fragmented in gnathostomes.
How did the jawed vertebrate AIS arise?
As discussed above, the BCR–TCR–MHC-based AIS is present in cartilaginous fish but
absent in lower chordates. Two macroevolutionary events — the invasion of the RAG
transposon and two whole-genome duplications (WGDs) — are believed to have provided
the innovation and raw material, respectively, for the relatively rapid emergence of the AIS
in jawed vertebrates. In this section we discuss the potential contribution of these two
events.
The recombination-activating gene transposon
In the late 1970s, Sakano and Tonegawa discovered recombination signal sequences (RSSs)
flanking V, D and J rearranging segments60, and they noticed that the inverted repeats
within the RSSs were reminiscent of a transposon. This suggested that a gene encoding an
immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) exon was invaded by a transposon. Therefore, the gene
could not be expressed unless it was stitched back together through the action of a
recombinase. There are many IgSF genes in lower chordates that are related to BCR and
TCR V regions (the so-called ‘VJ’ type of IgSF gene; FIG. 1), so there are many candidate
genes that could have been invaded by the RAG transposon in a vertebrate ancestor61. For
example, the gene family encoding the variable region containing chitin-binding proteins
(VCBPs) in amphioxus is presumed to be involved in defence and could be related to the
non-rearranging ancestor of the BCR and TCR genes62. Other genes that might be related to
the ancestral VJ gene (for example, ReFS 63–65) are described below.
The RAG1 and RAG2 genes have no homologous regions and no introns but are closely
linked to each other, which suggests that they could have been acquired by vertebrates as
part of the original transposon4,66. Complete RAG genes have been isolated from all
gnathostomes studied, but not from jawless fish. This is consistent with the idea that
acquisition of the RAG transposon helped to trigger BCR- and TCR-based immunity.
Surprisingly, linked RAG1 and RAG2 genes were found in the genome of the sea urchin (an
echinoderm)67 (FIG. 1), which implies either that the RAG transposon invaded the genome
100 million years before the emergence of adaptive immunity and remained dormant, or that
it had invaded at multiple times. The authors suggested that a RAG1-like gene invaded the
genome and inserted near a RAG2-like gene that was subsequently included in the original
transposon. The RAG1-like gene could have originated from transib — a transposon that
encodes the RAG1 core and that has been found in many organisms68 — or, as Dreyfus has
recently suggested69, from a viral genetic element. RAG2 then lost its original function and
was co-opted to the VDJ rearrangement process. This proposition is consistent with recent
work showing that RAG2 does not contribute to rearrangement per se, but instead interacts
with modified histones at sites of active transcription70. We propose a working model in
which RAG2 binds to active regions of transcription and RAG1 binds to the exposed RSS.
RAG1 interacts with, and is dependent on, RAG2 to initiate VDJ rearrangement, but RAG1
performs all of the major functions associated with recombination.
Regardless of the route of its emergence in chordates, the RAG transposon invasion must
have been crucial for adaptive immunity, as all of the BCR and TCR genes use the same
mechanism of VDJ rearrangement. Furthermore, despite arguments to the contrary71, RAG
activity was likely to have been an innovative event for adaptive immunity, as jawed
vertebrates have many novel mechanisms and molecules that are involved in immunity in
general, and adaptive immunity in particular, compared with jawless fish (discussed further
below)72.

Whole-genome duplication
Nearly 40 years ago, Susumu Ohno proposed that the vertebrate genome underwent one or
two rounds of WGD at the stage of fish or amphibians through a tetraploidization process73.
Although this proposal was a matter of hot debate until recently (BOX 1), it is now widely
accepted that the vertebrate genome experienced two rounds of WGD after the emergence of
urochordates and before the radiation of jawed vertebrates74–77 (FIGS 1,4). WGDs seem to
have had a crucial role in the emergence of jawed vertebrate-type adaptive immunity78,79.
This is indicated by the fact that many ohnologues, which arose as a result of WGDs, are
essential components of the jawed vertebrate-type AIS80,81.
The MHC paralogy group (FIG. 4a) and the HOX paralogy group (Supplementary
information S1 (figure)) are illustrative examples. In the case of the MHC paralogy
group82–84, paralogues of more than 100 gene families are distributed in four sets of
paralogons (for a list of gene families, see REF. 85). As would be expected from Ohno's
theory of WGD, the genomes of invertebrates, such as amphioxi84,86 and Ciona
intestinalis87, do not have multiple sets of MHC paralogons and contain only one MHC-like
region, which is devoid of class I and II genes (a proto-MHC).
Recently, Olinski et al.85 suggested that the neurotrophin paralogy group (FIG. 4, left) and
the MHC paralogy group (FIG. 4, right) were derived from neighbouring regions on the
same ancestral chromosome. This suggestion is based on the observation that several genes
of the MHC- and neurotrophin-paralogy groups are linked in the genomes of C.
intestinalis85 and amphioxi88. Interestingly, chromosomal regions 12p13.2–p12.3 and
19q13.4, which encode the human nK complex (nKC) and leukocyte receptor complex
(LRC), respectively (BOX 2), are embedded in the neurotrophin paralogons89. Therefore,
Olinski et al.'s suggestion provides a logical basis for the earlier proposals that the ancestors
of nK receptor genes encoded in the nKC and LRC were located in the proto-
MHC55,57,90,91.
Strikingly, the integrated MHC/neurotrophin paralogy group encodes many ohnologues that
have important functions in the AIS, particularly in antigen presentation by MHC class I and
II molecules (FIG. 4; Supplementary information S2 (table)). In addition to TAP and
tapasin, three proteasome subunits that are specialized for antigen presentation are encoded
in this paralogy group, together with some of their paralogues. Similarly, the integrated
paralogy group encodes 10 of the 11 cathepsin ohnologues, including cathepsins S and L,
which have crucial roles in antigen presentation by class II molecules and in thymic
selection. Other examples include: retinoid X receptor-β (RXRB) and regulatory factor X5
(RFX5), which encode proteins that regulate the expression of class I and II molecules,
respectively; NOTCH1, which is involved in lymphocyte differentiation; and VAV1, which
is required for T and B cell development and activation (Supplementary information S2
(table)).
The convergent AIS of jawless vertebrates
With some exceptions, and despite the involvement of the well-conserved and rapidly
evolving molecular features described above, the AIS of jawed vertebrates has been
remarkably uniform over 500 million years. Functional assays of jawless vertebrates
(lampreys and hagfish) have shown signs of adaptive immunity, but neither adaptive
immune molecular characteristics nor tissues, such as a thymus or spleen, were detected in
these animals. For example, jawless vertebrates produce specific agglutinins when
immunized with particulate and soluble antigens92–95, but extensive transcriptome analysis
of jawless fish leukocytes provided no evidence for the presence of MHC, BCR or TCR
molecules96–98. Their absence has been recently confirmed by the analysis of the sea

lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) draft genome sequence. How can they mount adaptive
immune responses in the absence of BCR, TCR and MHC molecules? The discovery of a
VLR gene, which generates diversity by somatically rearranging leucinerich repeat (LRR)
modules7, provided an answer99. The germline VLR gene lacks gene segments coding for
LRR modules and is not capable of encoding functional proteins (FIG. 3b). During the
development of lymphoid cells, LRR modules that flank the gene are sequentially
incorporated into VLR by a process called ‘copy choice’100. Incorporation is presumably
mediated by cytidine deaminases of the AID-APOBeC family8. The mature VLR gene
encodes a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchored polypeptide. The sequence of individual
LRR modules assembled into the VLR gene is highly diverse, and the number of LRR
modules present in a rearranged gene varies from one to nine. Therefore a single VLR gene
can have combinatorial diversity comparable to that of Igs (～1014 combinations)101. The
crystal structures of hagfish VLR monomers indicate that they adopt a horseshoe-like
solenoid structure that is characteristic of LRR family proteins. The majority of variable
residues in the VLR are located on the concave surface, which suggests that this surface is
involved in antigen binding102. This was recently confirmed by in vitro mutagenesis
experiments103 and the crystal structure analysis of VLR in complex with the human blood
group H-trisaccharide104 or with hen egg lysozyme105.
Lampreys have two VLR genes: VLRA and VLRB8. Both seem to be expressed exclusively
in lymphoid cells, and they usually exhibit allelic exclusion. Stimulation with antigens
causes lymphoid cells expressing specific VLRB molecules to undergo clonal expansion and
to secrete VLRs in a manner analogous to the secretion of Igs by B cells7,101. Secreted
VLRB molecules occur as pentamers or tetramers of dimers and have eight to ten
antigenbinding sites103. Therefore, the subunit organization of secreted VLRB molecules
resembles that of IgM antibodies. The multivalent structure of VLRB enables it to bind
antigens carrying repetitive epitopes with high avidity and specificity, and it displays strong
agglutinating activities106. It has been suggested that, like subclasses of IgM, VLRB might
preferentially or exclusively recognize thymus-independent antigens106. By contrast, VLRA
seems to occur only in a cell-bound form and is expressed on lymphoid cells that
functionally resemble T cells. Therefore lampreys have two populations of lymphoid cells
that seem to be functionally similar to the T and B cells of jawed vertebrates107.
Hagfish also have two VLR genes108, VLRA and VLRB, which are presumed to be
orthologous to lamprey VLRA and VLRB, based on sequence comparison. They map to the
same chromosome but are distant from each other, which indicates that they function as
separate units109. Consistent with this, the rearranged VLRA and VLRB genes do not share
an LRR module with an identical nucleotide sequence. It remains to be determined whether
hagfish VLRA and VLRB are functionally similar to the corresponding lamprey genes.
Origin of the two distinct forms of AIS
Both VLRs and BCRs/TCRs rely on combinatorial diver-sity to generate a vast repertoire of
binding specificities; however, the genes of VLRs show no structural similarity to those of
BCRs or TCRs (FIG. 3). Their recombination machineries must differ because RAG1 and
RAG2 are required only for BCR/TCRs. These observations suggest that the ancestors of
jawed and jawless vertebrates developed their antigen receptors independently.
Although VLRs probably exist only in lampreys and hagfish, the origin of LRR modules is
ancient; LRR module repeats are found in many animal and plant proteins, in which they
seem to mediate protein interactions or microbial recognition. It has been proposed, on the
basis of the similarity of gene structures and a characteristic insertion in the LRR carboxy-
terminal (LRRCT) domain, that an ancestor of VLR might have emerged from a

glycoprotein Ib-α (GPIb-α)-like protein (GPIb-α is a component of the platelet glycoprotein
receptor complex that is conserved in all vertebrates)8. Furthermore, searches for IgSF
proteins in jawless vertebrates have identified molecules that are thought to be related to the
potential evolutionary precursors of BCRs and TCRs63–65. These are: the agnathan paired
receptors resembling antigen receptors (APAR) family of innate immune receptors, which
encode a group of membrane proteins carrying a single extracellular V-type Ig-like domain
with a canonical J segment64; and an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif-
bearing membrane protein, named ‘TCR-like’65, which has V-C2-type domain organization
and seems to be closely related to the novel immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation
motif-containing IgSF receptor (nICIR) family of activating innate immune receptors110.
The occurrence of these receptors in jawless vertebrates suggests that a common ancestor of
all vertebrates had V-type Ig-like domains that evolved into the Ig-like domains of BCRs
and TCRs. Hence, as mentioned above, it seems that a vertebrate ancestor had both BCR/
TCR and VLR precursors (FIG. 5). In a jawed vertebrate lineage in which RAG insertion
occurred, an IgSF protein was ‘chosen’ as an antigen receptor, which led to the BCRs and
TCRs. In a jawless vertebrate lineage with no appropriate RAG insertion, an LRR protein
family that could mediate microbial recognition was ‘chosen’ as an antigen receptor, which
led to the VLRs.
The occurrence of structurally unrelated receptors that are used for the same or similar
purposes is not unprecedented (BOX 2). For example, in primates the nK receptors that
interact with classical MHC class I molecules are members of the killer cell Ig-like receptor
(KIR) family, but in rodents the corresponding receptors are C-type lectin-like molecules
known as Ly49 receptors111. A common ancestor of primates and rodents is thought to have
had precursor genes for both types of nK receptors; the KIR gene family expanded in the
primate lineage and the Ly49 family expanded in the rodent lineage112,113. We suggest that
the ancestors of jawed and jawless vertebrates adopted distinct molecules as their antigen
receptors in an analogous manner.
The observation that jawless vertebrates have B- and T-like lymphoid cells107 indicates that
the two lineages of lymphoid cells emerged before the divergence of jawed and jawless
vertebrates (FIG. 5). Therefore, the origin of B- and T-like lymphoid cells is likely to be
more ancient than previously thought. This is compatible with recent observations that B
and T cells do not share an immediate common progenitor, but differentiate from myeloid B
progenitors and myeloid T progenitors, respectively88,113–115. This suggests that B- and T-
like lymphoid cells diverged before the divergence of myeloid and lymphoid cells. Although
we must be cautious when using cell lineage information as a proxy for the order of
evolutionary emergence, it seems likely that the building blocks for both types of antigen
receptors and also the two lineages of lymphoid cells were present in a common ancestor of
all vertebrates (FIG. 5).
Pressures for adaptive immunity
Why did the AIS arise? As noted above, invertebrates and plants manage with innate
mechanisms of defence (however, it should be mentioned that primitive adaptive systems
have been described in several invertebrate taxa116 and that an RnAi-like mechanism
provides a potent adaptive response in many organisms117). Indeed, it has been argued that
an anticipatory system of defence is more trouble than it is worth, as it necessitates the
generation of tolerance to self during the ontogeny of lymphocytes, and failure to regulate
these defence mechanisms can result in autoimmunity118. Furthermore, the adaptive system
might only be maintained when under strong selective pressure: organisms such as cod119,
seahorses120 and axolotl121, which might not be under strong pressure from pathogens, seem

to have lost the capacity to mount effective immune responses, at least as far as they can be
measured experimentally121.
However, we think that at least the BCR–TCR–MHC system arose as a potent system of
defence. It is believed that this system emerged in animals with jaws, which are likely to
have been predatory. Large predators generally do not have many offspring, thereby
maintaining a ratio of predator-to-prey that perpetuates the status quo122. Sharks, the oldest
living vertebrates with this adaptive system, have many new mechanisms of reproduction to
protect young offspring — such as impenetrable eggcases and modes of viviparity that have
converged on the mechanisms in mammals. Therefore it can be proposed that a potent
system of defence arose in conjunction with the need to protect offspring. In jawless fish, the
AID-APOBEC family members might have enabled the diversification of a preimmune
repertoire of IgSF genes, as seems to be the case for the VLR system. The addition of the
RAG transposon to this adaptive system would have provided a great advantage, causing a
break during rearrangement that would have created the potential for large variations in the
size of one of the CDR loops that interact with antigens37. This advantage, along with the
raw material of a large number of newly duplicated genes that could be co-opted for immune
functions, probably resulted in the highly complex AIS seen today in gnathostomes.
Conclusions
There are many characteristics of the AIS that can generally be agreed upon: jawless and
jawed fish both have an AIS based on different gene families, but the BCR–TCR– MHC-
based system is more complex; the RAG transposon and WGDs had major roles in the
emergence of the jawed vertebrate AIS, and the major features of the system arose early in a
‘big bang’ and have been modified only slightly over evolutionary time; and the jawed
vertebrate AIS displays both conserved and plastic features, the former presumably to allow
for a general functioning of the system and the latter to permit rapid changes over
evolutionary time to respond to pathogens11.
Many questions still need to be addressed, most of which will require incremental progress.
For example, what is the nature of the RAG transposon? What are the functions of antigen
receptors in different organisms, especially the γδ TCR? And how is the VLR system
regulated? However, there are two glaring questions: did T-and B-like lymphoid cells really
emerge in the common ancestor of jawless and jawed vertebrates, and what were the
pressures that selected for the emergence of the AIS? Regarding the first of these questions,
besides what we have discussed above concerning the antigen receptors, it is essential to
determine whether, like gnathostome αβ T cells, the ‘T-like lymphoid cells’ of jawless
vertebrates recognize processed antigens, perhaps through presentation on a convergent type
of ‘MHC’ molecule. Instead, they might recognize native antigens in a cellbound form,
perhaps in a way similar to the recognition that occurs for some subsets of gnathostome γδ T
cells. Because the lamprey ‘T cell’ antigen receptor VLRA has been shown to bind soluble
antigens and because its gene apparently mutates after antigenic stimulation, our prediction
is that the γδ TCR-like mechanism will prove to be correct123. Regarding the second
question, we will never be able to resolve this problem experimentally. new ideas
concerning selection pressures suggest that the capacity of the immune system to distinguish
between commensal and pathogenic microorganisms resulted in the great complexity of the
gnathostome AIS124,125. The understanding of the immune system's interactions with
commensal organisms is in its infancy, and perhaps we can develop defined hypotheses as
this field develops. One hypothesis, which emphasizes the importance of the gut, suggests
that with the advent of jaws, digested material could injure the intestine and therefore result
in massive infections. The seahorse, which has seemingly lost features of adaptive
immunity, is a filter-feeding animal, so it is speculated to have reverted to a pre-adaptive

state120. Our view is that the AIS arose as a system of defence and became more crucial and
more sophisticated with the emergence of the large predatory jawed vertebrates that bore
few offspring. We think that our position has been strengthened by recent evidence that has
shown that the jawed vertebrates in which it is believed that the AIS first emerged — the
placoderms — had internal fertilization126. We hope that this Review will spark further
interest in this area, especially among non-immunologists who might see the problem from a
fresh perspective.

Mutation of the variable gene after mature B cells are stimulated.
It results in affinity maturation of the antibody response. Like
the class switch, it requires activation-induced cytidine
deaminase
Variable–diversity–
joining

Immunoglobulins
Also known as antibodies or B cell receptors, they are composed
of two identical heavy (H) and light (L) chains that are
covalently linked by disulphide bonds. Monomeric
immunoglobulins are bivalent, and the binding site is made up of
the amino-terminal variable domains of one H and one L chain.
The class or isotype of an immunoglobulin is defined by its H
chain.
Jawless fish
Primordial vertebrates without jaws, of which the only two
extant forms are lampreys and hagfish.
Major
histocompatibility
complex
A large complex of tightly linked genes, many of which are
involved in immunity. It encodes the polymorphic class I and
class II molecules, which present antigens in the form of
peptides to cytotoxic and helper T cells, respectively.
Jawed vertebrates
Vertebrates from cartilaginous fish to mammals. The first class
of vertebrates with jaws, the placoderms, all became extinct.
Mucosal immunity
Immune responses made across epithelial surfaces, such as the
gut and lung.
Immunoglobulin new
antigen receptor
(IgNAR.) A specialized antibody in sharks that is composed of
disulphide-linked heavy chains and no associated light chains.
Translocon
organization
An organization of immunoglobulin genes in which there are
multiple variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) segments
upstream of a single constant gene.
Cluster organization
An organization of immunoglobulin genes in which there are
single variable (V), diversity (D), joining (J) and constant gene
segments, although sometimes two or three diversity segments
occur together. Also known as minilocus organization.
Receptor editing
The re-rearrangement of antigen receptor genes to avoid self
reactivity in the case of B cells or to express new receptors that
can be positively selected in the case of T cells.
Class switch
The rearrangement of an existing variable–diversity– joining
(VDJ) exon from the 5′ end of the immunoglobulin M gene to
downstream constant (C) genes. Like somatic hypermutation, it
requires activation-induced cytidine deaminase.
Major
histocompatibility
complex restriction
T cell receptors recognize antigens in the form of small peptides
ranging from 9–22 amino acids that are bound to major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I or class II molecules.
The T cell receptor recognizes both the MHC protein and the
peptide antigen — this is known as ‘MHC restriction.’.
Complementarity-
determining region 3
A loop in the variable (V) region of the B cell receptor and T
cell receptor chains that is encoded by the variable– diversity–
joining (VDJ) intersection that is generated by recombination-
activating gene (RAG)-mediated somatic rearrangement. It is the
part of the antigen-binding site that is most diverse in amino acid
sequence and length.

Transporter
associated with
antigen processing
(TAP). A transporter of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily
that is involved in the transport of peptides from the cytosol into
the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. It is a heterodimer
composed of TAP1 and TAP2 subunits and has a crucial role in
the transport of major histocompatibility complex class I-
binding peptides.
Tapasin
A protein that facilitates the binding of peptides to major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules by forming
a bridge between MHC class I molecules and transporter
associated with antigen processing (TAP).
Recombination signal
sequences
Conserved nucleotide sequences flanking variable (V), diversity
(D) and joining (J) segments that are recognized by the
recombination-activating gene (RAG) proteins to induce
rearrangement.
Immunoglobulin
superfamily
Domains of 90–100 amino acids composed of 7–9 β strands
forming two sheets, generally stabilized by a disulphide bond.
Found in B cell receptor, T cell receptor and major
histocompatibility complex molecules.
Ohnologues
Paralogues, named after Susumu Ohno, that are thought to have
emerged close to the origin of vertebrates by whole-genome
duplication.
Paralogy group
A set of paralogons that are derived from a single ancestral
region.
Paralogues
(Also known as paralogous genes.) Genes within a single species
that belong to the same gene family. In contrast to ‘paralogues’,
‘orthologues’ refers to genes that diverged by speciation events.
Paralogons
Chromosomal segments that contain closely linked sets of
paralogues. Also known as paralogous regions.
Agglutinin
Any substance that can clump particles together.
AID-APOBEC
A family of cytidine deaminases that are involved in the

Controversies surrounding whole-genome duplication
The idea that the vertebrate genome underwent two rounds of whole-genome duplication
(WGD) at a time close to the origin of vertebrates — known as the two-round (2R)
hypothesis — caused hot debate for more than a decade. The major evidence in favour of
this hypothesis was that paralogues that emerged close to the origin of vertebrates are not
distributed at random in the human genome, but have a strong tendency to occur in
clusters, known as paralogons, on multiple — typically four — chromosomes. The major
arguments against this hypothesis were twofold127,128. First, ohnologues (for example, A,
B, C and D) generated by two rounds of WGD should display the tree topology (that is,
A and B together and C and D together), which is not always the case127. Second,
paralogons occasionally contain paralogues that duplicated much earlier than the origin
of vertebrates. We now know that incongruent tree topologies can occur if two waves of
genome doubling occurred in close succession129, if paralogues have evolved at different
evolutionary rates130 or if the resolving power of phylogenetic trees is not sufficient129.
Also, the divergence time of paralogues can be much older than the age of WGD if
tandem duplication preceded WGD and the duplicated genes were lost differentially after
WGD. Therefore, neither of these two counterarguments contradicts the 2R hypothesis.
Recently, comparison of the human and amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae) genomes
revealed widespread quadruple conserved synteny, in which four sets of human
paralogons corresponded to one set of linked genes in B. floridae131. This observation
provided definitive evidence for the 2R hypothesis and settled the long-standing debate.
The exact timing of WGD relative to the emergence of jawless vertebrates (FIG. 1) is still
controversial. A commonly held view, which we also favour, is that the first round of
WGD occurred in a common ancestor of jawed and jawless vertebrates, and the second
round in a common ancestor of jawed vertebrates76. However, recent analysis of 55 gene
families in jawless vertebrates suggested that both rounds of WGD might have taken
place in a common ancestor of all vertebrates, although this analysis could not discount
the idea that the second round of WGD occurred in a common ancestor of jawed
vertebrates132, as depicted in FIG. 1.

Natural killer cell receptors
Natural killer (NK) cells are part of the innate immune system. They can produce
cytokines and kill virally infected cells without a clonal proliferation phase. NK cells
share many characteristics with T cells, including most cell-surface markers, elaboration
of the same effector functions and origins from a similar haematopoietic precursor111.
However, the NK cell receptor (NKR) recognition strategy is different from that of T
cells (although the signalling cascades are homologous). When cells become virally
infected, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules are often
downregulated, making the cells ‘invisible’ to cytotoxic T cells. Inhibitory NKRs on NK
cells recognize MHC class I molecules; when the inhibitory NKRs are not engaged, the
NK cells can be stimulated by activating receptors that often recognize stress-induced
molecules that are upregulated on viral infection. This is known as the ‘missing self
hypothesis133.
Unlike T cell receptors (TCRs), NKRs are not generated by recombination-activating
gene (RAG)-mediated recombination, but rather through stochastic, clonal expression of
a few receptors from a cluster of genes encoding activating and inhibitory NKRs. These
receptors are encoded by the NK complex (NKC) and leukocyte receptor complex
(LRC), found on different chromosomes in all mammals examined. The NKRs that
recognize classical (polymorphic) class I molecules are encoded by genes in different
gene families in various species, for example the C-type lectin Ly49 genes found in the
NKC in mice and the killer immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) receptor (KIR) genes
found in the LRC of humans. This is the only known case in the immune system in which
receptors from different gene families perform precisely the same functions in closely
related species, and it is a testament to the rapid evolution of the NK system of defence.
Evidence from comparative studies of the MHC, LRC and NKC strongly suggest that the
three complexes were originally linked and that their polymorphic receptors and ligands
have co-evolved, as has been found in many histocompatibility systems in plants and
invertebrates59.

Figure 1. Overview of the evolution of the immune system in deuterostomes
The stages in phylogeny at which the immune molecules referred to in this Review emerged.
Molecules restricted to jawed and jawless vertebrates are indicated in blue and green,
respectively. Molecules that emerged at the stage of invertebrates are in pink.
Recombination-activating gene (RAG)-like genes (indicated in purple) are of viral or
bacterial origin (from the transib transposon family) and are also present in the genomes of
sea urchins and amphioxi. Agnathan paired receptors resembling antigen receptors (APAR)
and novel immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif-containing immunoglobulin
superfamily receptor (NICIR, also known as T cell receptor (TCR)-like) are agnathan
immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) molecules that are thought to be related to the
precursors of TCRs and B cell receptors (BCRs). 1R and 2R indicate the two rounds of
whole-genome duplication (WGD). Whether the 2R, the second round of WGD, occurred
before or after the divergence of jawed and jawless vertebrates is controversial; the figure
places it after the divergence according to the commonly held view (BOX 2). An ancestor of
the majority of ray-finned fish is thought to have experienced an additional, lineage-specific
WGD (designated as 3R) ～320 million years ago134,135. The divergence time of animals
(shown in Mya (million years ago)) is based on Blair and Hedges136. MHC, major

heavy chain genes. T cell receptors generate diversity in a similar manner (not shown). They
occur only in a membrane-bound form. b | Variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) in jawless
vertebrates. Multiple amino-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRRNT)-, leucine-rich repeat
(LRR)-, connecting peptide (CP)- and carboxy-terminal LRR (LRRCT)-encoding modules
are located adjacent to the germline VLR gene. During the development of lymphoid cells,
these modules are incorporated into the VLR gene. The rearranged VLR gene encodes a
membrane-bound protein. VLRB has a secreted form and functions as an antibody, whereas
VLRA apparently occurs only in a membrane-bound form. Whether membrane-bound VLRs
occur as monomers or multimers is not known. LRR1 and LRRVe denote LRR modules
located at the N- and C-termini, respectively. The organization of the VLR locus shows
minor variations depending on loci and species. The figure is intended to emphasize the
essential features of VLR assembly and does not accurately reproduce the organization of a
specific VLR locus. SP, signal peptide.

Figure 4. The major histocompatibility complex paralogy group and the neurotrophin paralogy
group in the human genome
Four sets of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) paralogons are located on chromoso
mes 1, 6, 9 and 19 (ReFS 55,137,138). A number of smaller-sized MHC paralogons, which
presumably originated from fragmentation and subsequent translocation of the major
paralogons, have been identified55. Among them, those located on 15q13-q26 and 5q11–q23
seem to have broken off from the paralogons on chromosomes 6 and 9, respectively130. Four
sets of major neurotrophin paralogons are located on chromosomes 1, 11, 12 and 19 (REF.
89).The MHC paralogy group (right) and neurotrophin paralogy group (left) are thought to
have descended from neighbouring regions on a single ancestral chromosome. Paralogues
that are distributed across the two paralogy groups are indicated by blue highlighted text. In
addition to genes that share paralogues among the relevant paralogons, immunologically
important genes, such as those encoding MHC class I, MHC class II, T cell receptors
(TCRs), and immunoglobulins (Igs) are shown. A2M, α2-macroglobulin; B2M, β2-

Figure 5. A hypothetical model for the origin of the two major forms of adaptive immune system
The occurrence of B- and T-like lymphoid cells in jawless vertebrates indicates that they
were likely to be present in a common ancestor of all vertebrates107. Similarly, the
occurrence of a V-type immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain with a canonical joining (J)
segment in jawless vertebrates indicates that a common ancestor of all vertebrates had V-
type Ig-like domains that could be converted to B cell receptor (BCR) or T cell receptor
(TCR) Ig-like domains. Amphioxus, a basal chordate, has a glycoprotein Ib-α (GPIb-α)-like
protein, which is the most likely precursor to the variable lymphocyte receptor (VLR)8.
Therefore, a common ancestor of all vertebrates presumably had all of the key structural
elements of the two radically different antigen receptors. Acquisition of recombination-
activating gene (RAG) recombinase activities and the second round of whole-genome
duplication (WGD; indicated as 2R) are thought to have had a crucial role in the emergence
of the BCR–TCR–MHC-based adaptive immune system (AIS). Little is known about the
genetic events that contributed to the emergence of the VLR-based AIS in jawless
vertebrates. It is possible that the first round of WGD (indicated as 1R) contributed to the
emergence of the two lineages of lymphoid cells; however, we cannot rule out the possibility
that their origin predates the emergence of vertebrates.
