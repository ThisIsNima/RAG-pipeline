Abstract 
This article systematically reviewed the epidemiology studies on sports injury which 
ankle injury was included. The time span started from 1977 to 2005. A total of 227 
studies reporting injury pattern in 70 sports from 38 countries were included. The total 
included cases were 201600 with 32509 (16%) ankle injuries. A total of 11847 (84%) 
ankle sprains were recorded from 14098 cases with available ankle injury information. 
Results show that the ankle was the most common injured body site in 24 of the 70 
included sports, especially in aeroball, wall climbing, indoor volleyball,

----- Page 4 (native) -----
mountaineering, netball, and field events in track and field. Ankle sprain was the 
major ankle injury in 33 of the 43 sports, especially in Australian football, field 
hockey, handball, orienteering, scooter and squash. In general sports injury among 
countries, the ankle was the second most common injured body site after the knee, 
and ankle sprain was the most common type of ankle injury. The incidence of ankle 
injury and ankle sprain was high in court game and team sports, such as rugby, soccer, 
volleyball, handball, basketball, field hockey, dancing, American football, netball and 
lacrosse. This systematic review provides a summary of the ankle injury 
epidemiology in sports. 
 
1. Introduction 
People from all around the world are participating in sports nowadays for personal 
interest, relaxation, health and fitness training. However, sports is one of the major 
causes of injuries which is comparable to traffic accidents, home and leisure accidents, 
occupational injuries, and violence[1-4]. Sports injuries result in pain, loss of playing or 
working time, as well as medical expenditure. Severe injuries may result in bone 
fractures, functional instability, limited mobility, disability, permanent cease of sports 
participation, psychological problem, and perhaps death. For world-class and 
commercial sports teams, absence of key players due to unexpected injuries may 
result in defeats in major games and huge economic loss. Due to these undesired 
adverse effects, scientists and medical specialists are actively working on sports injury 
prevention[5-7]. The aim is to prevent sports injury and let people enjoy sports 
participation. 
 
The first procedure to tackle a problem is to identify the problem. In 1970, Roser and 
Clawson conducted an epidemiology study on football injuries in young athlete[8]. In

----- Page 5 (native) -----
1971, MacIntosh conducted similar study on athletic injuries in University of 
Toronto[9]. In 1972 and 1973, Garrick conducted related studies in prevention of sports 
injuries[5] and prevention of ankle sprains[10]. To be more specific in identifying the 
problem, Garrick pioneered a series of ankle sprains epidemiology studies from 
1977[11]. Subsequent studies by Garrick investigated ankle injuries in different sport 
events including aerobic dance[12], children and adolescent skiing[13], women 
gymnastics[14], ballet[15], and in all sports[16]. From 1980 afterwards, numerous 
epidemiology studies were conducted on different sports, population, gender, playing 
level and in different countries[3, 16-21]. These epidemiology studies generally reported 
that ankle is one of the most traumatized body sites in sports injuries in an overview 
on different sports, population, gender, playing level and in different countries. They 
reported that ankle injuries are accounting for 10-30% of all sports injuries. In some 
sports, the percentage of ankle injuries is even higher, such as 40% in 
mountaineering[22] and handball[23], 41% in volleyball[24] and youth soccer[25], 45% in 
female cheerleading[26], 46% in artistic gymnastic[27], 53%[28] and 54%[29] in softball, 
and 56% in women floorball[30]. In 1988, Garrick reported that the percentage can be 
higher in some sports[16]. From epidemiology data collected from 1979 to 1987, that 
percentage of ankle injuries was 74% in softball, 76% in racquet sports and football, 
77% in weight-lifting and dancing, 79% in basketball, and 82% in volleyball. Ankle 
sprain is the most common type of ankle injury in most sports. It may account for 
more than 80% and even as much as 100% of ankle injury sustained in some sports, 
such as squash[31], orienteering[32], scooter[33], soccer[34], figure skating[35], Australian 
football[36], rugby[37], field hockey[38], handball[39] and volleyball[24]. In those sprains, 
about 77% of them are lateral sprains[40] and 73% of them involved rupture or tear to 
anterior talofibular ligament[41]. In a survey conducted in 1994 on 380 athletes with 
563 sprained ankles, Yeung reported that most of these injured athletes were pursuing

----- Page 6 (native) -----
running and jogging activities (25%), racquet sports (20%), ball games (19%), soccer 
(14%) and fencing (6%)[21]. The residual problem included pain (30.2%), instability 
(20.4%), crepitus (18.3%), weakness (16.5%), stiffness (14.6%) and swelling (13.9%). 
For ankle sprained once to four times, the major residual problem is pain (24-28%). 
For ankle sprained five times or more, instability problem arises and becomes the 
major sequale (38%). 
 
In 1987, van Mechelen proposed a “sequence of injury prevention” which describes 
how sport injuries related studies stand together and form the whole research 
framework[42]. The first step is to identify the extent of the sports injury problem by 
epidemiology studies. The second step is to establish the aetiology and mechanism of 
injuries. The third step is to design and introduce preventive measures. Finally the 
effectiveness of the preventive measures is assessed by repeating the first step, which 
is the epidemiology study. Those epidemiology studies conducted by Garrick and 
other researchers[11-16] play an important role in locating the problem of ankle sprains 
in sports in the model of “sequence of injury prevention”. With this information, 
subsequent studies can be done to identify risk factors to injury[43] and injury 
mechanism [44], to design prevention equipment[45, 46], and to finally evaluate the 
effectiveness of these preventive measures[47, 48]. The purpose of this study is to 
systematically review the epidemiology studies on sports injury published by 
researchers in different sports and countries from 1977 to 2005 in order to identify the 
distribution of reported injuries among ankle and other body sites. Moreover the ankle 
injury types were also summarized. The time span starts from the first epidemiology 
study on ankle sprains published by Garrick in 1977[11]. The summarized findings will 
help sports medicine specialists to identify the patterns of ankle injury in sports, and 
to reassure the targets of future researches.

2. Methods 
Systematic literature search of Medline (from 1966), ISI Web of Knowledge (Science 
Citation Index Expanded, from 1985; Social Sciences Citation Index, from 1956; Arts 
& Humanities Citation Index, from 1975), PubMed (from 1950), and Sport Discus 
(from 1975) was conducted at the last week of January in year 2006. The search 
keyword string was “ankle AND (injury OR injuries OR sprain) AND (sport OR 
sports) AND (epidemiology OR epidemiologic OR epidemiological OR survey OR 
statistics OR patterns OR pattern)” appeared in title, abstract and keyword fields. The 
initial total number of identified articles from these databases was 744. After 
removing duplicates the count was reduced to 514. The title and abstract of each entry 
was read to identify and exclude non-epidemiology and non-related studies. Articles 
not written in English were excluded. After the trimming the count was reduced to 
419. Online and library search for full text of these 419 articles was conducted. 
Articles not available in the library in The Chinese University of Hong Kong were 
requested from other libraries in local universities. The number of the article which 
full text was retrieved was 331. 
 
The full text of each of the 331 retrieved articles was read in order to determine 
inclusion or exclusion in the analysis. To be included in the analysis, the study should 
report epidemiology findings of injury sustained in one or more sports activities, and 
should fulfill either one of the two following criteria: (1) the study reported injury at 
ankle joint, with either prevalence percentage among other body sites, or the 
incidence rate among the surveyed sample, (2) the study reported ankle sprain injury, 
with either prevalence percentage among other ankle injury types, or the incidence 
rate among the surveyed sample. Review articles, case report and current concepts

----- Page 8 (native) -----
from specialists were excluded. After the screening process the final number of 
articles included in the analysis was 227.  
 
Demographic data of the included studies were summarized. It included the 
geographical location where the study was conducted, period of the study, population 
investigated, prospective or retrospective nature of the study and case number. 
Geographical location was summarized in country and continent where the study was 
conducted. Period of study was categorized as before 1980, 1981-85, 1986-90, 
1991-95, 1996-00 and 2001-05. Population investigated was categorized as (1) team, 
which the subjects were from sport teams or clubs, (2) public, which the subjects were 
from public population attending accident and emergency department in hospitals or 
sports medicine clinics, (3) event, which the subjects were from competition events 
and games, (4) school, which the subjects were student athletes from schools and 
universities, and (5) military, which the subjects were military recruits. Case number 
was categorized in 5-year intervals as 1-100, 101-500, 501-1000, 1001-2000, 
2001-5000, 5001-10000 and >10000. Some studies reported data in a period of time 
overlapping two or more 5-year intervals were counted in all period included and 
made the total counts exceeding the total number of study. 
 
The 227 included studies reported a total of 255 epidemiology reports, as some 
studies reported epidemiology in more than one sport. All epidemiology reports were 
categorized in sports. Epidemiology studies reporting general sport injury patterns in a 
country but not on specific sport were categorized in countries. 
 
In each sport and country, the most common injured body sites and ankle injury types 
ranked by weighted prevalence percentages were shown in tables. Eleven body site

----- Page 9 (native) -----
group were categorized: (1) ankle, (2) foot, (3) leg / shin / calf, (4) knee, (5) thigh / 
hamstring, (6) hip, (7) trunk / back / spine, (8) shoulder, (9) arm / elbow, (10) hand / 
fingers, and (11) head / neck / face. Some studies reported the percentage of injury of 
several body sites, such as foot and ankle, hip and thigh, or arm and shoulder. For 
these studies the combined percentages were divided evenly for each included site. 
Some studies combined the whole upper or lower extremity and made the distribution 
pattern among each body site too superficial. In these cases the study will be excluded 
as it failed to comply with the inclusive criteria that the study should report injury 
pattern in different body sites with ankle injury reported. However if ankle and hand 
injury were separately reported from lower and upper extremities, the study was 
included and the percentages of lower and upper extremity were considered in the leg 
(leg / shin / calf) and arm (arm / elbow) categories. Ankle injury type was classified 
into 11 categories: (1) sprain, (2) fracture, (3) strain, (4) abrasion, (5) contusion, (6) 
tendinitis, (7) blister, (8) impingement, (9) cramp, (10) bruise, and (11) laceration. 
 
Among injured body sites, prevalence of ankle injury was represented by weighted 
percentages calculated by the sum of the percentage of injury in a specific body site 
times the number of all injuries in each included study, then divided by the sum of the 
total number of all injuries. Among ankle injury types, prevalence of ankle sprain was 
represented by weighted percentages calculated by the sum of the percentage of ankle 
injury type times the number of all ankle injuries in each included study, then divided 
by the sum of the total number of all ankle injuries. The calculations were shown in 
the following mathematics formula.

3. Results 
3.1 Demographic data 
Two-hundred-twenty-seven epidemiology studies were included. Some studies 
reported injury epidemiology in two or more countries and thus made the total count 
255. Most studies were conducted in Europe (45.5%), North America (30.2%) and 
Australasia (11.8%). Only a few studies were from Asia (4.3%), South America (2.0%) 
and Africa (0.4%). Distribution of geographical location of the included studies is 
shown in Table 1. Among countries, results showed that most studies were conducted 
in the United States (24.3%), followed by the United Kingdom (13.3%), Australia 
(8.2%), Sweden (7.1%) and Denmark (6.3%). 
 
The period of study, population investigated, nature of study and the case number 
were summarized in Table 2. Most epidemiology studies were published from 
1986-2000 with even distribution among this time span. Thirty-seven studies (12.9%) 
did not report the duration of study. The population investigated was mostly from 
sports team and clubs (40.5%), followed by public participants (29.5%), competition

----- Page 11 (native) -----
event (15.4%), schools (11.0%), and military (0.9%). Six studies (2.6%) did not 
describe the population investigated. Nature of study was identified to be prospective 
(75.3%) or retrospective (18.9%). Thirteen studies (5.7%) did not describe the study 
nature. Most studies had case volume from 101-500 (49.8%). The total case number 
of sports injury included was 201600, and the number of ankle injuries included was 
32509. 
 
3.2 Prevalence of ankle injuries among sports 
The total number of sports included in the analysis is 70. The weighted percentage of 
the most common injured body sites were shown in Table 3. Among these 70 sports, 
ankle ranked first in the most popular injured body site in most studies (24 sports, 
34.3%), followed by knee (14 sports, 20.0%), head (8 sports, 11.4%), trunk (6 sports, 
8.6%) and hand (6 sports, 8.6%). Figure 1 showed the weighted percentage of ankle 
injury in all 70 included sports. Ankle injury was most common in aeroball (80.0%), 
wall climbing (60.0%), indoor volleyball (45.6%), mountaineering (40.0%), netball 
(39.8%) and field events in track and field (39.2%). The prevalence of ankle injuries 
was over 20% in 25 sports. 
 
3.3 Prevalence of ankle sprains among sports 
Information about ankle injury was available in 43 sports, as shown in Table 4. The 
total case number of sports ankle injury included in analyzing the ankle injury type 
was 14098, and the number of ankle sprains was 11847. Ankle sprain was most 
common (33 sports, 76.7%), followed by fracture (7 sports, 16.3%). Figure 2 showed 
the weight percentage of ankle sprain in the 43 included sports. In some sports, all 
reported ankle injuries were ankle sprain (100%). These sports included Australian 
football, field hockey, handball, orienteering, scooter and squash. In addition to these

----- Page 12 (native) -----
six sports, ankle sprain percentage was also higher than 80% in indoor volleyball, 
American football, martial arts, basketball, aeroball, ultimate, flag football, 
cheerleading, indoor soccer, ice hockey, lacrosse, badminton and netball. 
 
3.4 Prevalence of ankle injury and ankle sprains among countries 
Epidemiology data in general sports were available in eight countries as shown in 
Table 5. In general, the knee was the most popular injured site (16.0-27.0%), followed 
by the ankle (11.2-20.8%), with an exception that the hand was most popular in 
Sweden (19.8%) and Holland (21.8%). For Holland, ankle ranked second (20.8%) 
after the hand (21.8%). For Sweden, ankle ranked third (15.6%) after the hand (19.8%) 
and the knee (16.0%) Ankle injury type information was available in three countries. 
Sprain was the most popular type of ankle injuries (33.0-73.0%), followed by 
abrasion (25.2%) and fracture (7.4-16.0%). 
 
3.5 Incidence of ankle injuries 
Incidences of ankle injuries were shown in Table 6. In terms of incidence per 1000 
person-hours, hurling and camogie had the highest general incidence (32.88), 
followed by rugby (8.14), soccer (6.52), basketball (5.20) and triathlon (4.70). In 
game, the incidence was highest in soccer (34.83), followed by rugby (14.00), 
American football (13.80) and indoor soccer (11.68). In training, soccer showed the 
highest incidence rate (2.74). In terms of incidence per 1000 person-year, field hockey 
showed the highest incidence rate (1000.00), followed by orienteering (571.43), 
dancing (466.20), gymnastics (425.90) and gaelic football (374.70). In terms of 
incidence per 1000 person-season, soccer showed the highest incidence in general 
(1200.00), game (143.40) and training (64.00). Australian football also has 
comparable game incidence (111.10). In terms of incidence per 1000 person-exposure,

----- Page 13 (native) -----
tennis showed the highest incidence (11.30), followed by basketball (9.17) and netball 
(5.26). In game, netball showed the highest incidence (45.60), followed by rugby 
(8.88), American football (6.38), basketball (3.77) and wrestling (2.71). 
 
3.5 Incidence of ankle sprains 
Incidences of ankle sprains were shown in Table 7. In terms of incidence per 1000 
person-hours, rugby had the highest general incidence (4.20), followed by soccer 
(2.52), volleyball (1.99), handball (1.59) and basketball (1.00). In game, the incidence 
was highest in soccer (11.68), followed by Australian football (4.86) and soccer (4.59). 
In terms of incidence per 1000 person-year, field hockey showed the highest 
incidence rate (1000.00), followed by rugby (233.40), basketball (173.50), dance 
(155.40) and American football (60.60). In terms of incidence per 1000 person-season,

person-exposure, lacrosse showed the highest incidence (2.56), followed by basketball 
(1.90), Alpine skiing (1.60), soccer (1.15) and field hockey (0.90). In game, netball 
showed the highest incidence (40.06), followed by rugby (6.31), American football 
(6.06) and basketball (3.45). 
 
4. Discussion 
This is a large scale systematic review which involved 227 published studies from 38 
countries, reporting injury pattern in 70 different sports with a total of 201600 
included injury cases and 32509 included ankle injury cases. A total of 14098 ankle 
injuries were included in analyzing the most common ankle injury type, and 11847 
ankle sprains were included in this study. The time span covered the past 29 years 
from 1977 to 2005 inclusive. With such large coverage on the published data

----- Page 14 (native) -----
contributed from researchers all around the world, this literature research should 
attract attention from researchers in identifying the problem of sports injury in injury 
prevention research. Although the details of injury in each sport cannot be listed out in 
this paper, researchers may learn the overview of published epidemiology data and 
identify the relevant articles for further information from this review. However, 
readers should pay attention that only those epidemiology studies with ankle injury 
reported were included in this analysis. This study can be a deputy in only ankle 
injury patterns in sports but not in general injury patterns. 
 
Most epidemiology studies included in this analysis were from English speaking 
countries in North America, Europe and Australasia. There were fewer studies from 
Asia, South America and Africa. However, literature search showed epidemiology 
studies published from these countries in their own language. However as a result of 
language barrier, these studies are not included. Moreover, due to higher education 
level, scientific research activities were more active in those developed countries in 
North America, Europe and Australasia. Therefore most of the included studies were 
contributed by these countries and made the analysis more representing the injury 
pattern in these countries rather than a global fact. This is a limitation from the 
language and level of scientific research activities. 
 
Some studies, especially those published in older years, did not describe full 
demographic details of the study. The information was obvious but the authors 
sometimes just did not report them. For example, some authors did not report the 
location which the study was conducted[11, 12, 15, 49-57]. Some may only report the city 
or town name and it was sometimes impossible for international reader to identify its 
exact location[16, 58, 59]. The nature of study, the period of data collection, and the

----- Page 15 (native) -----
participants investigated were also often missed, as indicated in Table 2. Although 
these data might not be always important to every reader, reporting this information 
enriches the completeness of the published epidemiology study. 
 
From the period of study reported, there were not many published epidemiology 
studies reporting sports with ankle injury before 1980. After 1981, the number of 
these studies increased and remained in a steady amount of published studies until 
2000. From 2001 to 2005 the number of recorded studies dropped. This may reflect a 
decline of interest of epidemiology researches, a shift in sport event of interest which 
involves no ankle injury, or maybe a total vanish of ankle injury in some sports in 
recent years. The populations investigated were mainly team athletes (40.5%) and 
public participants (29.5%), which should well represent organized and recreational 
sports participation. Three fourth (75.3%) of the studies were prospective, which are 
expected to better represent the real injury patterns from better experimental control 
and data collection procedure. Most studies (49.8%) were with included cases from 
101-500, which was quite enough for epidemiology data reporting. Therefore the 
authors believed that the summarized findings are representative and should have 
significant value in helping readers to identify the ankle injury patterns. 
 
Within the 70 included sports, ankle injury was most common in 24 sports, with 
highest weighted percentage in aeroball (80.0%), wall climbing (60.0%), indoor 
volleyball (45.6%), mountaineering (40.0%), netball (39.8%) and field events in track 
and field (39.2%). Within the 43 sports with information about ankle injury, ankle 
sprain was most common in 33 sports. The percentage of sprain among all ankle 
injuries reached 100% in 6 sports, over 80% in 19 sports, over 60% in 26 sports, and 
over 40% in 34 sports. Among the eight countries included in this study, the knee was

----- Page 16 (native) -----
the most popular injured site (16.0-27.0%), followed by the ankle (11.2-20.8%), with 
an exception that the hand was most popular in Sweden (19.8%) and Holland (21.8%).  
Sprain was the most popular type of ankle injuries (33.0-73.0%) from the information 
from three included countries. From the results, ankle injury was concluded to be one 
of the most commonly injured body sites in sports, and ankle sprain was the most 
dominating type of ankle injury in most of the sports. 
 
In studying the weighted percentage of the injured body sites, reader should note that 
the higher percentage did not necessarily mean higher incidence of injury to this site. 
The figures only represented the distribution of the recorded injury in different sites. 
For example a 80.0% ankle injury rate in aeroball did not mean a more frequent injury 
occurrence to a 21.2% ankle injury rate in soccer, as the incidence rate of injury in 
soccer (71.13 incidence per 1000 person-year) was much higher than that in aeroball 
(1.37 incidence per 1000 person-year). From this review, the incidence of ankle injury 
and ankle sprain were high in court game and team sports, such as rugby, soccer, 
volleyball, handball, basketball, American football, Australian football, Gaelic 
football, tennis, netball, lacrosse and field hockey. Moreover, the incidence was also 
high in gymnastics, orienteering, dancing and skiing. In general, incidence in 
competitive games was higher than in general. 
 
Moreover, reader should be aware that a higher incidence rate did not necessarily 
mean higher severity of the sports injury. It only reported the frequency of injury 
occurrence but did not report the severity of each injury. In ankle sprain, the severity 
can be ranked in grades, such as Grade 1, 2 and 3. However there were several kinds 
of rating scale for ankle sprain. Moreover, such information was rarely reported in the 
epidemiology studies and thus was not summarized in this review study.

----- Page 17 (native) -----
The high incidence did not yet show the whole fact of the sports injury. For example, 
among the listed sports with high ankle injury and ankle sprain incidence, soccer may 
have the highest ankle sprain case amount as it was a very popular sport in the world. 
Although lacrosse showed a higher ankle sprain incidence (2.56 incidence per 1000 
player-exposure) than soccer did (1.15 incidence per 1000 player-exposure), the total 
case amount of ankle sprain sustained in lacrosse sport may be fewer as the sport was 
less popular. Such information of total amount of incidence was not available from 
this review. Garrick and Requa[16] conducted a prospective epidemiology studies in 
the United States from 1979 to 1987 with 19 sports with 17750 included cases. 
Among these cases, most of them were sustained during running (about 4200, 24%). 
The total number of ankle injuries were highest in running (about 350), followed by 
ballet (about 220), basketball (about 130), tennis (about 90) and soccer (about 70). 
Although the percentages of ankle injuries were higher in soccer and basketball in 
Garrick and Reque’s study[16], the total case number was fewer than that of running as 
a result of smaller participation rate. From the results from this study, the incidence 
rate per 1000 player-hours was 0.02 for running, 5.20 for basketball and 6.52 for 
soccer. This showed that with we should also consider the popularity of a specific 
sport, or the total participants in this specific sport, in order to decide which sport we 
should select to implement injury prevention measures. 
 
The results from this study may give sports medicine specialist some idea to decide 
their target sports for implementing injury prevention protocols to prevent ankle 
sprain. It also can serve as a standard or baseline for sports team to evaluate their 
injury pattern by comparing it to the reported data in this review. If a team or league 
recorded higher ankle injury or ankle sprain incidence than those found in the

----- Page 18 (native) -----
literature, it may be necessary to closely examine the injuries, sports equipment, 
facilities and everything. Moreover, when injury prevention protocols were introduced 
to a certain population, sports medicine specialists can evaluate their effectiveness by 
investigating the injury patterns and incidence with the data reported in this study. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Ankle injury was most common in aeroball, wall climbing, indoor volleyball, 
mountaineering, netball, and field event in track and field. Among ankle injury, ankle 
sprain was the most common injury type. In Australian football, field hockey, 
handball, orienteering, scooter and squash, all of the reported ankle injuries were 
sprain. Sprain was also very common in other sports, especially the court and team 
sports. In epidemiology of sports injury from general sports among countries, the knee 
was the most suffering body sites, preceding the ankle. In the United States, Holland 
and Hong Kong, ankle sprain was the most common ankle injury type. Ankle injury 
and ankle sprain incidences were highest in court game and team sports, such as rugby, 
soccer, volleyball, handball and basketball. 
 
This systematic review provides a summary of the ankle injury epidemiology in sports. 
It helps sports medicine specialist in deciding which sport to implement injury 
prevention measures. However, one should also pay attention on the popularity of 
sports as a high participate rate would also significant increase the total injury cases. 
We suggested that ankle sprain prevention should be implemented in rugby, soccer, 
volleyball, handball and basketball. We should also implement ankle sprain 
prevention in running, as it is the most popular sport in the world with most 
participants.
