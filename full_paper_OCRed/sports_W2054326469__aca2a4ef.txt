A survey on robotic devices for upper limb
rehabilitation
Paweł Maciejasz1,2,3, Jörg Eschweiler4*, Kurt Gerlach-Hahn5, Arne Jansen-Troy4 and Steffen Leonhardt5
Abstract
The existing shortage of therapists and caregivers assisting physically disabled individuals at home is expected to
increase and become serious problem in the near future. The patient population needing physical rehabilitation of
the upper extremity is also constantly increasing. Robotic devices have the potential to address this problem as noted
by the results of recent research studies. However, the availability of these devices in clinical settings is limited, leaving
plenty of room for improvement. The purpose of this paper is to document a review of robotic devices for upper limb
rehabilitation including those in developing phase in order to provide a comprehensive reference about existing
solutions and facilitate the development of new and improved devices. In particular the following issues are discussed:
application field, target group, type of assistance, mechanical design, control strategy and clinical evaluation. This
paper also includes a comprehensive, tabulated comparison of technical solutions implemented in various systems.
Introduction
An individual’s capacity to move is necessary to perform
basic activities of daily living (ADL). Movement disorders
significantly reduce a patient’s quality of life. Disorders
of the upper extremities specifically limit the indepen-
dence of affected subjects. Fortunately, there are vari-
ous approaches to restore the functionality of the upper
extremity, e.g., orthoses, functional electrical stimulation,
and physical therapy. Positive outcome of physical reha-
bilitation, in the case of neurologically based disorders,
depends heavily on: onset, duration, intensity and task-
orientation of the training [1,2], as well as the patient’s
health condition, attention and effort [3]. Intense repe-
titions of coordinated motor activities constitute a sig-
nificant burden for the therapists assisting patients. In
addition and due to economical reasons, the duration of
primary rehabilitation is getting shorter and shorter [4].
These problems will probably exacerbate in the future
as life expectancy continues to increase accompanied by
the prevalence of both moderate and severe motor dis-
abilities in the elderly population [5] and consequently
increasing their need of physical assistance. To counteract

these problems, prevailing research studies present a wide
variety of devices specifically assisting physical rehabilita-
tion. Robotic devices with the ability to perform repetitive
tasks on patients are among these technically advanced
devices. In fact, robotic devices are already used in clinical
practice as well as clinical evaluation. However, consider-
ing the number of devices described in the literature, so
far only a few of them have succeeded to target the subject
group — for more details see Table 1. Furthermore, it
seems that the outcome of the use of devices already in
clinical practice is not as positive as expected [3]. New
solutions are being considered. Most of the literature
reviews on robotic devices for upper extremity rehabilita-
tion (e.g. [6,7]) concentrate on devices that have already
undergone clinical evaluation. Gopura and Kiguchi [8]
compared the mechanical design of selected robotic
devices for upper extremity rehabilitation. However, no
other publication presents a summary of different robotic
solutions for upper extremity rehabilitation, including
those being in the development phase. An assessment
of different technical solutions would provide develop-
ers of robotic devices for upper limb rehabilitation an
evaluation of solutions that have already been consid-
ered, and thus learn from successes as well as shortfalls
from other research teams. Hence, a comparison of var-
ious robotic devices would facilitate the development of

All the systems in the following table are grouped according to the joint movement they support. For the sake of convenience, we consider the shoulder complex, the
forearm and the hand (fingers) as single joints. Thus, we distinguish the following “joints”: shoulder, elbow, forearm, wrist and fingers. Devices assisting movements of
only one “joint” (starting from shoulder and ending with fingers) are described first followed by devices assisting movement of two, three and four joints (in that
order). The end of the table presents systems assisting movement of the whole arm.
For some systems it was difficult to classify them into a particular group. One of such cases includes the end-effector-based systems with a splint. A specific
classification to particular group may depend on the joints constrained in particular case by the splint. Furthermore, some devices allow for movements in some joints
only in a limited range.
In some cases the same system may appear multiple times in the table on various stages of development. We have accepted such occurrences only if, in our opinion,
the difference between two versions of the system justified considering them as two various systems. Otherwise, information included in the table includes only the
most recent version of the system available at the time of this publication.
System names are provided in italics. Whenever possible, the first column of the table provides the system name and reference (including the name of the first author)
to the publication in which the system is described. We only provide the appropriate reference for systems without a name. The names of commercial systems are
followed by their producer names. Appropriate information is provided following a semicolon for commercial systems based on systems being described in scientific
publication before commercialization. Except one case, i.e. ArmeoSpring based on T-WREX system, the description of the predecessors is not provided elsewhere in the
table because we found no significant differences between the predecessors and their commercial versions.
The last column contains information about the current stage of system development, clinical trials performed using the system and some additional information are
provided. If the system has undergone clinical evaluation, information about the category of the trial, number of participants enrolled and their condition, as well as
reference to the paper presenting results of the study is also provided. We distinguish four categories of the studies marked as C0, CI, CII, CIII/CIV. For a description, see
Table 7. Categories CII and CIII/CIV provide two numbers of subjects. The first number indicates the total number of participants enrolled in the study. The number in
parenthesis indicates number of participants undergoing therapy using the particular system. We made this distinction because there is often a control group
undergoing other form of therapy in the CII and CIII/CIV studies. If both numbers are equal, all participants underwent therapy using the specified system but other
parameter of the study varied between the groups (e.g. training intensity, device control strategy, or order in which various forms of therapy were applied). No
reference after the number and condition of participants indicates that the reference is the same as the one provided in the first column. Information about
predecessors or successors is also provided, if available. We use the following symbols and abbreviations:
- for degrees of freedom of the device (DOF) and supported movements (second and third column of the table respectively): [ ] - indicates passive (i.e. exerting only
resistive force) and { } - indicates not-actuated degrees of freedom or movements, otherwise active.
- for supported movements (third column): (joint name) - indicates that range of movements for that joint is limited to a very small range, AA – adduction/abduction,
FE – flexion/extension, GR – grasp and release, PS – pronation/supination, RT – internal/external rotation, HD - horizonatal displacement, VD - vertical displacement
(both in the shoulder girdle), MCP – metacarpophalangeal joint, * - indicates that the direction of the movement of the device does not correspond to the direction of
any of basic anatomical movements (e.g. pronation/supination, flexion/extension, rotation) but is a combination of many, (x number) - indicates that a few particular
movements are possible (e.g. flexion in a few joints of one finger), (in the plane) - indicates that the end effector of the device moves only in a specified plane; for the
explanation of anatomical terms of motion see Figure 2.
- for main control inputs and actuators (fourth and fifth column respectively): (commercial system name) - indicates that the particular commercial device (usually robot
or haptic interface) is incorporated in the described system and that the particular sensors or actuators are part of that commercial system.
- for main control (forth column): sEMG - surface electromyography.
- for actuators (fifth column): AC - alternating current, DC - direct current, ERF - electrorheological fluid based, FES - functional electrical stimulation, MRF -
magnetorheological fluid based, PAM - pneumatic artificial muscle, SEA - series elastic actuator, (x number) - number of particular actuators being used (provided only
if such an information was available).
- for clinical studies (last column): C0, CI, CII, CIII/CIV - category of the study: 0, I, II and III/IV, respectively (for category descriptions see the subsection Clinical studies of
the survey); subject condition: aS - acute stroke, CP - cerebral palsy, cS - chronic stroke, ET - essential tremor, hs - healthy subject(s), MS - multiple sclerosis, SCI - spinal
cord injury, sS - subacute stroke, TBI - traumatic brain injury; np - number of subjects is not provided.
new and improved devices for robotic upper limb reha-
bilitation. The aim of this paper is to summarize existing
technical solutions for physical therapy of the upper limb.
The survey of robotic devices is comprised of advanced
technology systems. As defined in this report, the
design of advance technology systems includes sensors,
actuators, and control units; purely mechanical solutions
are excluded from this survey. Although the research team
made an effort to identify as many systems as possi-
ble, it is reasonable to acknowledge that many systems

are left unmentioned. Nevertheless, this documentation
is intended to be a valuable source of information for
engineers, scientists and physiotherapists working on new
solutions for physical rehabilitation.
The survey
Scope of the survey
At the outset, the research team identified literature
associated with the subject matter based on searches
in PubMed, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers (IEEE), Science Direct and Google Scholar
databases using various combinations of the following
keywords: upper extremity, arm, hand, rehabilitation,
therapy, training, movement, motion, assistance, sup-
port, robot, robotized, robotic, mechatronic, and motor-
ized. Additionally, referenced literature from the selected
publications was included in the survey as well. The
information obtained from this literature compendium is
supplemented with the data acquired from professional
caregivers and manufacturers’ catalogs and websites, as
well as direct communications with rehabilitation profes-
sionals, manufacturers and patients. Over 120 systems are
summarized and compared in Table 1; this tabulated sum-
mary constitutes the reference for information provided in
subsequent sections. As previously mentioned, the scope
of this report is generally limited to the devices that sup-
port or retrain movement or manipulation abilities of
disabled individuals. This survey excludes systems devel-
oped for movement assessment, occupational purposes or
boosting physical abilities of healthy people. We however
considered some academic, not yet specialized systems,
supporting upper-extremity movements, especially if they
have potential to be used for rehabilitation purposes (e.g.
CADEN-7 [97]). This survey also excludes devices that
substitute movements of the disabled extremity but do
not replace the movement itself (e.g. wheelchair mounted
manipulators or autonomous robots). Although these
devices improve the patient’s quality of life, they differ
significantly from systems described in this survey and
constitute a separate category of devices. Some compa-
nies (e.g. CSMi Computer Sports Medicine, Inc.; Biodex
Medical Systems, Inc.; BTE Technologies, Inc.) manufac-
ture sensorized equipment for rehabilitation of various
joints and muscles and whose principle of operation often
resembles that of exercising devices found at fitness cen-
ters. Those devices are used mainly to strengthen muscles
and joints and provide some predefined resistance (e.g.
isotonic, isometric or isokinetic exercises) or active force
(e.g. continuous passive motion exercises). These devices
also constitute a different category from the systems
included in this survey because their functions are per-
formed along a predefined operation pathway. Although
difficult to clearly identify, the aforementioned were also
excluded from this review.
Throughout this report, the term “number of degrees
of freedom (DOF)” describes the sum of all independent
movements (i.e. displacements or rotations) that can be
performed in all the joints of the device. The number of
DOF is defined in order to determine the exact position
and orientation of all segments of the device. Also, some
sections in this report are supplemented by an explana-
tion of the most important terminology for readers who
are not familiar with the technical vocabulary.
Application field and target group
A description of the specific field of application for upper
limb rehabilitation devices often determines solutions for
which the device itself may be applied. Upper-extremity
rehabilitation involves actions that stimulate patients’
independence and quality of life. Two main application
fields of robotic devices stand out: support to perform
some ADLs (e.g. by power assistance or tremor suppres-
sion) and providing physical training (therapy). Although
there is a significant need for powered devices support-
ing basic ADL at home, there are only a few of such
devices proposed so far (see sixth column in Table 1).
This is mainly due to technical and economical restric-
tions. Such devices should significantly improve the lives
of their users, otherwise patients become dissatisfied and
discontinue their use shortly after. They should be also
safe, easily to handle and inexpensive. Portability is also
often expected from devices assisting patients to perform
basic ADL; in such cases the amount of available energy
is limited by the capacity to store energy. Furthermore,
if the device is supposed to support movements of mul-
tiple joints, the number of needed actuators increases as
well as the weight of the device. Therefore, the number
of portable actuated devices supporting upper extrem-
ity movements is typically low. Instead, purely mechani-
cal solutions are used for that purpose. A few examples
of portable powered devices for upper extremity assis-
tance used in daily living are PowerGrip system (Broaden
Horizons, Inc., USA) and a system proposed by Hasegawa,
et al. [98] (both for grasp assistance), as well as WOTAS
orthosis [99] and a system proposed by Loureiro, et al.
[100] (both for tremor suppression). However, portabil-
ity is not always necessary. Often, especially after a stroke
or a spinal cord injury, disorders of the upper extrem-
ity are accompanied by lower extremity disabilities. These
scenarios are typically characterized by immobilized con-
ditions and require a wheelchair. Therefore, many sys-
tems assisting upper limb movements are installed close
to the patient (e.g. modular wheelchair-mounted system
MUNDUS [101]).
Another group of the robotic devices used for rehabil-
itation purposes, much bigger than the group of devices
supporting basic ADLs, constitute devices providing
physical therapy. These may be designed for either

specialized therapeutic institutes or home-based condi-
tions. A vast majority of these devices may be used only
at therapeutic institutes since they require supervised
assistance from qualified personnel. Their price is often
prohibitive for personal use due to their complexity. The
patient demand for home-based therapy is expected to
increase. Along this context, the concept of the Gloreha
system (Idrogenet srl) is provided in two versions: (1) a
more complex and more adaptable professional version
intended for use at hospitals and rehabilitation centers and
(2) a simplified low-cost version intended for patient use
at home. However, according to Dijkers, et al. [102], many
therapists may stop using devices if set-up takes more than
5 minutes. Thus new developed devices for physical train-
ing should be intuitive, easy and fast to set-up and have a
reasonable price.
Stroke is the most common cause among diseases and
injuries for upper limb movement disorders. It is esti-
mated that by 2030, stroke will be the fourth leading
cause of reduced disability-adjusted life-years (DALY) in
western countries. DALY takes into account years of life
lost due to premature death as wells as years of life
lived in less than full health [103]. Other causes include
traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury and injuries
to motoneurons, as well as certain neurological diseases
such as multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, Guillain-Barre
syndrome, essential tremor and Parkinson’s disease. Cur-
rently proposed robotic systems for upper limb rehabilita-
tion are typically tested on stroke patients. Only a fraction
of these systems are investigated on subjects suffering
from other diseases (see last column of Table 1).
Type of assistance
The most important terminology introduced in this
section is explained in Table 2. Devices for upper limb
rehabilitation may provide different types of motion assis-
tance: active, passive, haptic and coaching. Active devices
provide active motion assistance and possess at least one
actuator, thus they are able to produce movement of the
upper-extremity. Most of the devices discussed in this sur-
vey are active (see Table 1). Such assistance of movements
is required if patient is too weak to perform specific exer-
cises. However, even with active devices, an exercise is
considered passive when a patient’s effort is not required.
For example, devices providing continuous passive motion
exercises are active, but those exercises are categorized
as passive because the subject remains inactive while the
device actively moves the joint through a controlled range
of motion. It is not necessary to apply active assistance
to resist patient’s movement, to increase patient’s force or
to ensure the patient is following the desired trajectory.
Instead, passive devices may be applied that are equipped
with actuators providing resistive force only (i.e. brakes).
Such actuators consume less energy and are cheaper than
Table 2 Glossary of terms concerning type of assistance
Term
Description
Active device
A device able to move limbs. Under such condition,
this device requires active actuators which may
increase the weight. It may also apply to subjects
completely unable to move their limb.
Passive device
A device unable to move limbs, but may resist the
movement when exerted in the wrong direction. This
type of device may only be used for rehabilitation of
subjects able to move their limbs. It is usually lighter
than active device since it possesses no actuators
other than brakes.
Haptic device
A device that interfaces with the user through the
sense of touch. In most cases it provides some
amount of resistive force, often also some other
sensation (e.g. vibration). It is sometimes also able to
generate specific movements. However, the force it
generates is usually small. Haptic devices are
commonly used in rehabilitation settings with virtual
environments.
Coaching device
A device that neither assists nor resists movement.
However, it is able to track the movement and provide
feedback related to the performance of the subject.
As haptic devices, coaching devices are also
commonly used in rehabilitation settings with virtual
environments.
Active exercise
An exercise in which subjects actively move their limb,
although some assistance of the device may be
provided. Such type of the exercise may be performed
using any of the above listed types of devices.
Passive exercise
An exercise in which the subject remains passive,
while a device moves the limb. This type of exercise
requires an active device. Continuous passive motion
(CPM) training is an example of passive exercise with
active devices.
the heavier actuators for active assistance. Devices using
only resistive actuators include both devices for physical
therapy, e.g. MEM-MRB [104] and PLEMO [105], and sys-
tems for tremor suppression, e.g. WOTAS [99] orthosis
and a system proposed by Loureiro, et al. [100].
Haptic devices constitute another group of systems
interacting with the user through the sense of touch.
Haptic devices are similarly classified as either active or
passive, depending on their type of actuator. In this report,
haptic devices are independently categorized because
their main function is not to cause or resist movement
but rather to provide tactile sensation to the user. Other
non-actuated devices for upper limb rehabilitation do
not generate any forces but provide different feedback.
These systems are labeled coaching devices through-
out this report. Because coaching devices are sensorized,
they serve as input interface for interaction with thera-
peutic games in virtual reality (VR) (e.g. T-WREX [106],
ArmeoSpring from Hocoma AG) or for telerehabilitation
(i.e. remotely supervised therapy). Coaching systems using
video-based motion recognition (e.g. Microsoft Kinect)
would also belong to this category if it were not for their

lack of any mechanical part in contact with the patient.
Therefore, these systems will not be further discussed in
this survey.
Passive and non-actuated systems are less complex,
safer and cheaper than their active counterparts. However,
they are often modified in the development process with
more active characteristics. Still, the main characteristic
that identifies a non-actuated or passive device is the lack
of the ability to perform movement; they may be an option
for continuation of the rehabilitation process, rather than
for training of people with significant movement disorders
at an early stage of rehabilitation.
Mechanical design
The most important terminology introduced in this
section is explained in Table 3. When comparing the
mechanical structure of robotic devices for movement
rehabilitation often two categories of devices are con-
sidered: end-effector-based and exoskeleton-based. The
Table 3 Glossary of terms concerning mechanical design
of robots for rehabilitation
Term
Description
End-effector based
device
Contacts a subject’s limb only at its most distal
part. It simplifies the structure of the device.
However, it may complicate the control of the
limb position in cases with multiple possible
degrees of freedom.
Exoskeleton-based
device
A device with a mechanical structure that mirrors
the skeletal structure of the limb, i.e. each segment
of the limb associated with a joint movement is
attached to the corresponding segment of the
device. This design allows independent,
concurrent and precise control of movements in a
few limb joints. It is, however, more complex than
an end-effector based device. Orthoses restricting
or assisting movement in one or more joints may
be also considered exoskeleton-based devices.
Planar robot
A device, usually end-effector based, moving in a
specific plane. Design of planar robots, decreases
costs as well as the range of movements that
may be exercised. Although this device performs
movements in a plane, joints of the limb may still
move in a three-dimensional space.
Back-drivability
A property of mechanical design indicating that
the patient is able to move the device, even when
the device is in passive state. It increases patient
safety, because it does not constrain limb
movements and keeps patient’s limb in a
comfortable position.
Modularity
A property of a device indicating that optional
parts may adapt it to a specific condition or simply
to perform additional exercises.
Reconfigurability
A property of a device indicating that its
mechanical structure may be modified without
adding additional parts in order to adapt it to the
condition of the subject or to perform other form
of training.
difference between the two categories is how the move-
ment is transferred from the device to the patient’s
upper extremity. End-effector-based devices contact the
patient’s limb only at its most distal part that is attached
to patient’s upper extremity (i.e. end effector). Movements
of the end effector change the position of the upper limb
to which it is attached. However, segments of the upper
extremity create a mechanical chain. Thus, movements
of the end effector also indirectly change the position of
other segments of the patient’s body as well. Compared to
end effectors, exoskeleton-based devices have a mechani-
cal structure that mirrors the skeletal structure of patient’s
limb. Therefore movement in the particular joint of the
device directly produces a movement of the specific joint
of the limb.
The advantage of the end-effector-based systems is
their simpler structure and thus less complicated con-
trol algorithms. However, it is difficult to isolate specific
movements of a particular joint because these systems
produce complex movements. The manipulator allows up
to six unique movements (i.e. 3 rotations and 3 transla-
tions). Control of the movements of the patients upper
limb is possible only if the sum of possible anatomical
movements of patient arm in all assisted joints is lim-
ited to six. Increasing the number of defined movements
for the same position of the end-point of the manipulator
results in redundant configurations of the patient’s arm,
thus inducing risk of injuries and complicated control
algorithms.
The typical end-effector-based systems include serial
manipulators (e.g. MIT Manus [107] - Figure 1B, ACRE
[108]), parallel (e.g. CRAMER [109] and a system pro-
posed by Takaiwa and Noritsugu [110], both for wrist
rehabilitation), and cable-driven robots (e.g. NeReBot
[111] - Figure 1C, MACARM [112]). The mechanical
structure of HandCARE [113] may be also recognized as
the series of end-effector-based cable-driven robots, each
of which induce movement of one finger. In this system
a clutch system allows independent movement of each
finger using only one actuator.
Application of the exoskeleton-based approach allows
for independent and concurrent control of particular
movement of patient’s arm in many joints, even if the
overall number of assisted movements is higher than six.
However, in order to avoid patient injury, it is necessary
to adjust lengths of particular segments of the manipu-
lator to the lengths of the segments of the patient arm.
Therefore setting-up such device for a particular patient,
especially if the device has many segments, may take a
significant amount of time. Furthermore, the position of
the center of rotation of many joints of human body,
especially of the shoulder complex [114], may change
significantly during movement. Special mechanisms are
necessary to ensure patient safety and comfort when an

bearing to modify orientation [136]; B: InMotion ARM - end-effector-based commercial system [133]; C: NeReBot - cable-driven robot, ©2007 IEEE.

exoskeleton-based robot assists the movements of these
joints [114]. For this reason, the mechanical and control
algorithm complexity of such devices is usually signifi-
cantly higher than of the end-effector-based devices. The
complexity escalates as the number of DOF increases.
In case of systems for the rehabilitation of the whole
limb the number of DOF reaches nine (ESTEC exoskele-
ton [115]) or ten (IntelliArm [116]). Some systems for
fingers or hand rehabilitation have an even higher num-
ber of DOF. Examples include the system proposed by
Hasegawa, et al. with eleven DOF [98] and the hand
exoskeleton developed at the Technical University (TU)
of Berlin with twenty DOF [117]. Even at such a high
number of DOF some of these devices still remain wear-
able (i.e. the user is able to walk within a limited area
due to connections to power source and control unit,
e.g. ESTEC and hand exoskeleton developed at the TU
Berlin) or portable (i.e. the area within which the user
may walk is not limited, e.g. the system proposed by
Hasegawa).
Apart from purely exoskeleton- or end-effector-based
devices, there are many systems combining a few
approaches. In the ArmeoSpring system (Hocoma AG)
for example, only the distal part – comprising the
elbow, forearm and wrist – is designed as an exoskele-
ton. Therefore the limb posture is statically fully deter-
mined (as in exoskeleton-based systems) and the shoulder
joint is not constrained, allowing easy individual sys-
tem adaptation to different patients. A similar concept
was applied in Biomimetic Orthosis for the Neuroreha-
bilitation of the Elbow and Shoulder – BONES [118].
In that case, a parallel robot consisting of passive slid-
ing rods pivoting with respect to a fixed frame pro-
vides shoulder movements. Such application of sliding
rods allows internal/external rotation of the arm without
any circular bearing element. The distal part allow-
ing for flexing/extending the elbow resembles the exos-
keleton structure. In the MIME-RiceWrist rehabilitation
system [119] the end-effector-based MIME [120] system
for shoulder and elbow rehabilitation is integrated with
the parallel wrist mechanism used in the MAHI exoskele-
ton (known as RiceWrist [119]).
Another example is the 6 DOF Gentle/S [121] system
allowing for relatively large reaching movements (three

actuated DOF of the end-effector-based commercial hap-
tic interface HapticMaster, Moog in the Netherlands BV
[122]) and arbitrary positioning of the hand (connection
mechanism with three passive DOF). The Gentle/S system
was further supplemented with a three-active-DOF hand
exoskeleton to allow grasp and release movements. This
new nine DOF system is known as Gentle/G [123].
The HEnRiE [124] is a similar system based on the
Gentle/S system. In addition to the three active DOF of
HapticMaster, HEnRiE includes a connection mechanism
with two passive DOF for positioning of the hand and
grasping device (two parallelogram mechanisms allowing
parallel opening and closing of fingers attachments) with
only one active DOF.
Some systems combine more than one robot at the
same time. This approach may be considered as the com-
bination of end-effector-approach, where only the most
distal parts of robots are attached to the patient’s upper
limb, with the exoskeleton-based approach, where move-
ments of few segments are directly controlled at the same
time. Use of two robots to control the movements of
the limb may allow for mimicking the operations per-
formed by therapist using two hands. Examples of sys-
tems using two-robot-concept include REHAROB [125]
(using two six-DOF manipulators), iPAM [126] and UMH
[127] (both having six DOF in total). Researchers at the
University of Twente, in Enschede, Netherlands, made an
attempt to use two HapticMaster systems to provide coor-
dinated bilateral arm training, but limitations in hardware
and software caused the virtual exercise to behave differ-
ently to the real-life [128]. In some cases industrial robots
have also been used. The REHAROB uses IRB 140 and IRB
1400H from ABB Ltd., while MIME [120] uses PUMA 560
robot. In general, industrial robots reduce costs; however,
such robots have significantly higher impedance than the
human upper limb and, according to Krebs, et al. [129],
should not be in close physical contact with patients.
Therefore most of the robots used for the rehabilita-
tion of the upper limb are designed with a low intrinsic
impedance. Some of those devices are also back drivable
(e.g. HWARD [130] and RehabExos [131]), meaning that
the patient’s force is able to cause movement of those
devices when they are in passive state. Back-drivability
further increases safety of the patient because the device
does not constrain patient movements. It also allows for
using the device as an assessment tool to measure patient’s
range of motion.
The majority of the devices presented in Table 1 allow
movements in three dimensions; however there are also
planar robots, i.e., systems allowing movements only on
a specified plane (e.g. MEMOS [132] and PLEMO [105]).
Also the MIT Manus system initially allowed movements
only on one plane [107]. Subsequently, an anti-gravity
module added possibility to perform vertical movements
[133] (Figure 1B). Designing the device as a planar robot
reduces the range of movements that can be exercised for
particular joint. It also reduces the cost of the device. Fur-
thermore, when the working plane is well selected, the
range of training motion may suffice in most of therapeu-
tic scenarios. Some of such planar devices allow changes
in the working space between horizontal and vertical
(Braccio di Ferro [134]) or even almost freely selecting the
working plane (e.g. PLEMO and Hybrid-PLEMO [135]). It
further increases the range of possible exercise scenarios
while keeping the cost of the device at a minimum.
In the ARM Guide [136] (Figure 1A) and ARC-MIME
[137] systems, with which patients practice reaching
movements, the working space is limited to linear move-
ments because the forearm typically follows a straight-line
trajectory. However the orientation of the slide that assists
forearm movements can be adjusted to reach multiple
workspace regions and fit different scenarios.
Modularity and reconfigurability are concepts that
could reduce therapy costs by adopting therapeutic
devices for various disabilities or stages in patient recov-
ery. However there are still only a few systems using these
concepts. For example, InMotion ARM robot (the com-
mercial version of MIT Manus, previously called InMotion
2.0) from Interactive Motion Technologies, Inc., may be
extended by InMotion WRIST robot (previously InMotion
3.0), developed at MIT [138] as a stand-alone system, and
InMotion HAND add-on module (previously InMotion
5.0) for grasp and release training. Another example of
modular system is MUNDUS [101], consisting of various
modules that may be included depending on the patient
condition, starting from muscle weakness to complete lost
of residual muscle function. For example as command
input residual voluntary muscular activation, head/eye
motion, or brain signals may be used. However, this sys-
tem’s complexity might make commercialization of the
device very difficult.
A very interesting solution was implemented in the Uni-
versal Haptic Drive (UHD) [139]. It has only two DOF and,
depending on the chosen configuration, it can train either
shoulder and elbow during reaching tasks or forearm
(flexion/extension) and wrist. For the latter setting option,
it is also possible to select a flexion/extension or prona-
tion/supination training for the wrist. See Figure 2 for an
explanation of anatomical terms used for description of
upper limb motion.
Actuation and power transmission
The most important terminology introduced in this
section is explained in Table 4. Traditionally, energy
to the actuators is provided in three forms: electric
current, hydraulic fluid or pneumatic pressure. The selec-
tion of the energy source determines the type of actua-
tors used in the system. Most of the devices for upper

extremity rehabilitation use electric actuators but there
are also other systems with pneumatic and hydraulic actu-
ators. The electric actuators are most common because
of their ease to provide and store electrical energy as
well as their relatively higher power. Various types and
sizes of electrical motors and servomotors are currently
commercially available. Some authors (e.g. Caldwell and
Tsagarakis [140]) argue that electric actuators are too
heavy, compared to their pneumatic counterparts, and
their impedance is too high to be used in rehabilita-
tion applications. However, the relatively high power-
to-weight ratio of pneumatic actuators is achieved by
neglecting the weight of the power source. Adding an
elastic element in series with the actuator may also miti-
gate the high impedance of electric motors. This concept
lead to the development of the so called Series Elastic
Actuators (SEAs). SEAs decrease inertia and user inter-
face impedance to provide an accurate and stable force

Description
Electric actuators
Actuators powered by electric current. They
are the most common because they easily
provide a relatively high power and are able
to store energy. There is a wide selection
of commercially available electric actuators;
however, some of them are heavy and/or
their impedance is too high for rehabilitation
settings.
Hydraulic actuators
Actuators powered by hydraulic pressure
(usually oil). They are able to generate high
forces. Their system is relatively complex
considering the maintenance of pressurized
oil under pressure to prevent leakage.
Commercial hydraulic actuators are also
heavy, therefore, only specially designed
hydraulic actuators are used in rehabilitation
robotics.
Pneumatic actuators
Actuators powered by compressed air. They
have lower impedance and weigh less than
electric actuators. Special compressors or
containers with compressed air are required
for power.
Pneumatic Artificial
Muscle (PAM, McKibben
type actuator)
A special type of pneumatic actuator with
an internal bladder surrounded by a braided
mesh shell with flexible, but non-extensible
threads. Because of their specific design, an
actuator under pressure shortens, similarly to
the contracting muscle. It is relatively light
and exerts force in a single direction. It is
difficult to control because of its slow and
non-linear dynamic functions.
Series Elastic Actuator
(SEA)
A generic name used for a mechanism with
an elastic element placed in series with an
actuator. This solution is relatively often
met in the design of rehabilitation robots. It
decreases the inertia and intrinsic
impedance of the actuator to allow a more
accurate and stable force control and
increase patient safety.
Functional Electrical
Stimulation (FES)
It is a technique that uses electrical current to
activate nerves and contract their innervated
muscles. It produces the movement of the
limb using natural actuators of the body.
However, it is difficult to achieve precise and
repeatable movement using this technique
and it may be painful for the patient.
control [141], thus increasing the safety of the patient. The
disadvantage of application with an elastic element is the
lower functional bandwidth. Still, the field of rehabilita-
tion does not usually require high bandwidths. SEAs with
electric motors are investigated in MARIONET [142] and
UHD [139] systems, as well as in systems proposed by
Vanderniepen, et al. (referred to as MACCEPA actuators)
[143] and Rosati, et al. [144].
A few systems use pneumatic actuators. Pneumatic
actuators are lighter and have lower inherent impedance
than the electric counterparts. Because such actuators

require pneumatic pressure, the system is generally either
stationary (e.g. Pneu-WREX [145]), its service area is lim-
ited (e.g. ASSIST [146]) or the compressor is installed
on the patient’s wheelchair (e.g. system proposed by
Lucas, et al. [147]). Special type of pneumatic actuators,
called Pneumatic Artificial Muscles (PAMs), Pneumatic
Muscle Actuators or McKibben type actuators are often
used in rehabilitation robotics (e.g. Salford Arm Rehabili-
tation Exoskeleton [148] or system proposed by Kobayashi
and Nozaki [149]). Such actuators consist of an internal
bladder surrounded by braided mesh shell with flexible,
but non-extensible, threads. When the bladder is pres-
surized, the actuator increases its diameter and shortens
according to its volume, thus providing tension at its ends
[150]. Due to such physical configuration, PAMs’ weight is
generally light compared to other actuators, but also have
slow and non-linear dynamic response (especially large
PAMs), in consequence they are not practical for clini-
cal rehabilitation scenarios [131,151]. In addition, at least
two actuators are necessary in order to provide antago-
nistic movements due to the unidirectional contracting.
The ASSIST system has a special type of PAM with rotary
pneumatic actuators that allows bending movements
[146].
A total of four systems using hydraulic actuators
were identified in this survey. All four of them are not
standard and use actuators developed specially for that
purpose. Reasons to evade industrial hydraulic actu-
ators include weight, impedance, fluid leakages and
difficulties to provide fluid. Large, noisy systems are
usually necessary for that purpose. Mono-and bi-articular
types of Hydraulic Bilateral Servo Actuators (HBSAs)
are used in the wheelchair-mounted exoskeleton pro-
posed by Umemura, et al. [152]. Miniaturized and flex-
ible fluidic actuators (FFA) were applied in the elbow
orthosis proposed by Pylatiuk, et al. [153]. Hydraulic
SEAs are used in two other systems: the Dampace
system [154] is equipped with powered hydraulic disk
brakes; the Limpact system [155], developed by the same
group, uses an active rotational Hydro-Elastic Actuator
(rHEA).
In passive systems, it is often desired to modify the
amount of resistance during the exercise. This modifi-
cation increases the resistance when the patient departs
from the desired trajectory or to provide haptic feed-
back for VR interactions. In existing systems, differ-
ent solutions for provision of adjustable resistive force
have been implemented. Powered hydraulic brakes, for
example, controlled by electromotors in a SEA are used
in Dampace system [154]. Magnetic particle brakes are
used in ARM Guide [136] (Figure 1A), in its succes-
sor ARC-MIME [137] to resist other than longitudinal
movements of the forearm, and in the device for train-
ing of multi-finger twist motion proposed by Scherer,
et al. [156]. A few groups have also investigated the
application of brakes incorporating magnetorheological
(MRF brakes) and electrorheological fluids (ERF brakes).
These fluids change their rheological properties (i.e.
viscosity) depending on the applied magnetic or elec-
tric field, respectively. Thanks to those properties it
is possible to achieve brakes with high-performance
(with rapid and repeatable brake torque) [105]. MRF
brakes are used in MRAGES [157] and MEM-MRB [104]
systems. ERF brakes are used in PLEMO [105] and
MR_CHIROD v.2 [158] systems. The same group that
developed the PLEMO also proposed ERF clutches to con-
trol the force provided by an electric motor in active
systems. Such an actuation system was implemented in
EMUL [159], Robotherapist [160] and Hybrid-PLEMO
[135] devices.
The natural actuators of body muscles can be used
instead of external actuators. For this purpose, an elec-
trical stimulation of the muscles leading to their contrac-
tion can be applied. This specific electrical stimulation
is known as Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES).
FES significantly reduces the weight of the device. From a
therapeutic point of view, FES allows patients to exercise
muscles, improving muscle bulk and strength and pre-
venting muscular atrophy [161]. It has been also shown
that FES, complemented by conventional physiotherapy,
may enhance the rehabilitation outcome [162]. However,
FES may cause strong involuntary muscle contractions
and can be painful for patient. Furthermore, it is dif-
ficult to control movements using FES because of the
non-linear force characteristic of contracting muscles,
muscles fatigue and dependency of the achieved contrac-
tion on the quality of the contact between stimulating
electrodes and the body tissue. There are two commer-
cial systems using FES for upper limb rehabilitation: Ness
H200 (Bioness, Inc., US) and NeuroMove (Zynex Medical,
Inc., US). Two other systems combining FES with assis-
tive force were proposed by Freeman, et al. [163] and
Li, et al. [164].
When selecting actuators, it is also important to con-
sider their location, especially with exoskeleton-based
mechanical structures. The actuators can be placed dis-
tally, close to the joints on which they actuate (e.g.
ArmeoPower system, Figure 1D). This specification sim-
plifies the power transmission by using direct drives.
However, it increases the weight of the distal part of the
device and inertia and makes it more difficult to control
the system. On the other hand, locating the actuators in
the proximal part of the device, often in the part that
remains constrained, reduces the weight and inertia of
the distal part. However, a power transmission mecha-
nism complicates the mechanical structure and may lead
to difficulties with control due to friction. For exam-
ple, the same group who developed InMotion HAND

system proposed an earlier prototype of the hand mod-
ule with eight active DOF and cable-driven mechanism
for power transmission. The friction in that mechanism
and its level of complexity was too high for clinical sce-
narios [165]. Nevertheless, there are systems, in which
power transmission using cables and gear drives was suc-
cessfully applied, like for example CADEN-7 [97] and
SUEFUL-7 [166].
Control signals
The most important terminology introduced in this
section is explained in Table 5. Various signals may be
used as control input of the device. Switches are often
used to simplify design. Examples include the PowerGrip
system from Broaden Horizons, Inc., hand held triggers
(e.g. FES based system for grasp assistance proposed by
Nathan, et al. [167]) and a joystick (e.g.MULOS [168]).
Most of the systems having more complex control strate-
gies use either kinematic, dynamic or a mix of both
input signals (see Table 1 for a comparison). The type
of the signal used as control input is partially determined
by the low-level control strategy and vice-versa. In some
cases, signals provided by actuator encoders (concerning
position or torque) may be directly used for control pur-
poses. However, usually torque measured by the encoder
is a sum of the torque exerted by the user on device
and internal torques in the device. Therefore, for better
control of forces between patient and device, it is use-
ful to apply additional sensors that will measure those
forces directly.
Some systems use surface electromyography (sEMG)
as an input signal, which provides information about
intention of the person to perform particular movement.
Therefore it is possible to detect and support it. Most of
such systems support elbow movements, as sEMG signals
from muscles controlling this joints (i.e. biceps brachii or
triceps brachii) are relatively easily measured. Among pro-
posed solutions are both stationary (e.g. systems proposed

Description
Dynamic signals
Signals related to the torque or force exerted
by the subject on various joints of the device
(exoskeleton-based device) or at its end effector
(end-effector-based device).
Kinematic signals
Signals related to positions, orientations, velocities
and accelerations of particular segments or joints
of the device or of the limb.
Trigger signal
A signal initiating a specific action. In simple cases,
a switch or a button triggers the signal. In more
complex cases, a threshold value of some signal is
specified to trigger the action (e.g. a sEMG value
corresponding to a level of muscle contraction).
by Rosen, et al. [169] and Kiguchi, et al. [170]) and portable
systems (e.g. systems proposed by Ögce and Özyalçin
[171] and Pylatiuk, et al. [153]). So far the most successful
of those systems is the one DOF portable orthosis devel-
oped at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),
Cambridge, US [172]. The system successfully sustained
clinical trials, received FDA approval and was commer-
cialized as Myomo e100 system (Myomo, Inc.) [173].
Examples of sEMG-controlled systems supporting move-
ments of other joints include those proposed by Kiguchi,
et al. [114] for shoulder rehabilitation, W-EXOS [174] for
forearm and wrist rehabilitation, PolyJbot [175] for wrist
rehabilitation, SUEFUL-7 [166] exoskeleton for whole
limb (excluding fingers) movement assistance, TU Berlin
Hand Exoskeleton [117] for fingers rehabilitation, as well
as 11-DOF portable orthosis for grasp assistance pro-
posed by Hasegawa, et al. [98]. The sEMG signals from
the contralateral healthy limb have been also used to con-
trol movements of the affected one (see system proposed
by Li, et al. [176]). The concept of using movements of
the not affected limb to control motion of the affected
one has been also implemented in Bi-Manu-Track sys-
tem (Reha-Stim, Germany), ARMOR exoskeleton [177]
and device proposed by Kawasaki, et al. [178]. Using the
other limb to control the affected one is especially useful
during rehabilitation after stroke. In cases of hemipare-
sis (or hemiplegia), often only one side of the body is
affected.
In some systems also contact-less movement detec-
tion methods have been used. For example, Ding, et al.
[179] proposed a system to assist the load of arbitrary
selected muscles using motion capture systems in order to
calculate the actual muscle force.
Feedback to the user
Different types of feedback may be provided to the
user, among them: visual, tactile, audio and in the form
of electrical stimulation. Some systems, for example
those proposed by Lam, et al. [180] and Nathan, et al.
[167], use vibrational stimulation of the muscle ten-
dons to support their contraction. It was also suggested
that providing tactile feedback to flexor and extensor
surfaces of the skin at the appropriate location could
produce more naturalistic movements and improve clin-
ical outcomes [3]. Some other systems combine other
types of the feedback, for example system proposed by
Casellato, et al. [181] combines visual and haptic feed-
back to improve motor performance of children with
dystonia.
A significant number of systems provide training in vir-
tual reality (VR) scenarios. VR provides a much more
interesting training surrounding to the patient, compared
to the typically available conditions presented in therapeu-
tic units. Furthermore, it allows for fast modification of

training scenarios, increasing patient attention and moti-
vation to perform the exercise. Therefore it may also
improve positive outcome of the therapy. It also adapts
the system for various patients in a very short time
frame and restarts the task if the object was dropped
or misplaced. Haptic devices are especially well suited
for provision of therapy in VR because they provide
an impression of manipulating the virtual objects. Some
groups developed own versions of haptic systems. For
example Takahashi, et al. [182] proposed haptic device
for arm rehabilitation, which can apply multiple types
of force including resistance, assistance, elasticity, vis-
cosity and friction. Other examples are: a two DOF
Haptic Interface for Finger Exercise (HAFI), which pro-
vides rehabilitation of only one finger at a time [183]; a
force reflecting glove, named MRAGES, using magneto-
rheological fluid [157]; MR_CHIROD v.2, a one DOF
grasp exercise device for functional magnetic resonance
imaging [158] and force-feedback glove Rutgers Mas-
ter II-ND [184], developed at the Rutgers University
(Piscataway, US) and used in hand therapy scenarios
(e.g. [185-187]).
Many groups have investigated application of a few
of commercial haptic devices for rehabilitation of upper
extremity. Among such haptic interfaces are:
- HapticMaster incorporated for example in Gentle/S
[121] (for other examples see Table 1),
- in-parallel robots Phantom Omni and Premium (Geo-
magic, Inc., US) - used e.g. in experiments performed by
Casellato, et al. [181], Brewer, et al. [188], and Xydas and
Louca [189],
- parallel robot Falcon (Novint Technology, Inc., US) -
used in My Scrivener system for hand writing training
(Obslap Research LLC, US) [190],
- force-feedback glove CyberGrasp (CyberGlove Systems
LLC,US) - used among others in therapeutic scenarios
investigated by Adamovich, et al. [191,192].
Because the entertainment industry have recently intro-
duced many new devices to capture motion of the healthy
people for interaction with VR-based games, it may be
expected that soon some of those devices will be also
adapted for rehabilitation purposes, providing so called
“serious games”.
Control strategy
The most important terminology introduced in this
section is explained in Table 6. Following the exam-
ple of Marchal-Crespo and Reinkensmeyer [193] we
will consider “high-” and “low-level” control strategies
used by rehabilitation robots. “High-level” control algo-
rithms are explicitly designed to provoke motor plasticity
whereas “low-level” strategies control the force, position,
impedance or admittance factors of the “high-level” con-
trol strategies.
Table 6 Glossary of terms concerning control strategy of
robots for rehabilitation
Term
Description
“High-level” control
strategy
A control strategy with control algorithms
explicitly designed to induce motor plasticity.
Assistive control
A “high-level” control strategy in which a device
provides the physical assistance to aid the patient
in accomplishing an intended movement.
Challenge-based
control
A “high-level” control strategy in which a device
challenges the patient to accomplish an intended
movement.
Haptic stimulation
A “high-level” control strategy in which a robotic
device is used as a haptic interface to perform
activities in virtual reality environment.
Couching control
A “high-level” control strategy in which a robotic
device neither physically assists nor resists the
movement of the subject. It only quantifies and
provides feedback (visual, acoustic or other)
concerning the performance of the subject during
exercise.
“Low-level” control
strategy
A control strategy considered in the implementa-
tion of the “high-level” control strategy in a device
by appropriate control of the force, position,
impedance or admittance.
Admittance control
A “low-level” control strategy in which the force
exerted by the user is measured, and the device
generates the corresponding displacement.
Impedance control
A “low-level” control strategy in which the motion
of the limb is measured and the robot provides the
corresponding force feedback.
This terminology is mostly based on the one proposed by Marchal-Crespo and
Reinkensmeyer [193].
“High-level” control strategies
There is a myriad of “high-level” control strategies for
robotic movement training. This section briefly summa-
rizes the classification of those strategies presented by
Marchal-Crespo and Reinkensmeyer [193]. They identify
four categorizes of control strategies: (a) assistive con-
trol, (b) challenge-based control, (c) haptic stimulation,
and (d) non-contacting coaching. Although some systems
may fall into a few of these categorizes, this classification
well illustrates main notions in the “high-level” control of
robotic devices for upper limb rehabilitation. Those con-
trol strategies in most cases correspond also to active,
passive, haptic and coaching types of motion assistance
described before.
The assistive control strategy makes tasks safer and
easier to accomplish, allowing more repetitions. There
are four types of assistive strategies: impedance-based,
counterbalance-based, EMG-based and performance-
based adaptive control. In the impedance-based strat-
egy, the patient follows a particular trajectory. The
device does not intervene as long as the patient fol-
lows this trajectory. However, as the patient leaves the
trajectory, the device produces a restoring force that

----- Page 20 (native) -----
Maciejasz et al. Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation 2014, 11:3
Page 20 of 29
http://www.jneuroengrehab.com/content/11/1/3
increases along with the deviation from the desired tra-
jectory. Often some margin of deviation from allowed
trajectory is accepted before restoring force is pro-
vided. Counterbalance-based strategies provide a par-
tial, passive or active weight counterbalance to a limb,
those making the exercises easier, as the amount of
force needed to move the limb against the gravity
may be significantly reduced. EMG-based approach uses
the patient’s own sEMG signals to either trigger or
proportionally control the assistance. Both of those
approaches encourage patients’ effort. However, the trig-
gered method is more susceptible to slacking, as the
patient may learn to provide only the amount of force
needed to trigger the assistance. Finally, the performance-
based adaptive control strategies monitor the perfor-
mance of the patient and adapt some aspects of the
assistance (e.g. force, stiffness, time, path) according to
the current performance of the patient, as well as per-
formance during particular number of preceding task
repetitions.
Challenge-based
control
strategies fall
into
three
groups: resistive, amplifying error and constraint-induced.
The resistive strategies resist the desired movements,
those increasing the effort and attention of the patient.
The error amplifying strategies are based on the theory
that faster improvements are achieved when error is
increased [194]. Therefore they track the deviations from
the desired trajectories and either increase the observed
kinematic error or amplify its visual representation on
the screen. The constraint-induced robotic rehabilitation
strategy, similarly to conventional constraint-induced
therapy, promotes the use of the affected limb by cons-
training the not affected one.
Haptic stimulation strategies make
use
of
haptic
devices described above, providing tactile sensation for
interactions with virtual reality objects. These strate-
gies support training of basic ADLs in safe conditions
and without long set-up. They provide alternate tasks in
various environments, attracting attention and providing
conditions for implicit learning.
Non-contacting coaching strategy is applied in systems
that do not contact participants but rather monitor their
activity and provide instructions to the patient. Instruc-
tions indicate how to perform particular activities or what
should be improved. Since such devices do not contact
the patient, they are not applicable for systems described
herein. However, this category may be extended to
include also some sensorized, but not-actuated exoskele-
tons, such as the gravity balancing orthosis T-WREX
[106].
“Low-level” control strategies
Different “low-level” control strategies are combined to
develop “high-level” rehabilitation strategies. Many “low-
level” control strategies may be proposed during fol-
lowing stages of development of a robotic rehabilitation
device. This report provides a short description of basic
approaches and does not include a comprehensive com-
parison of “low-level” control strategies. General books on
control engineering provide a more detailed description,
in addition to articles referenced in Table 1.
As the rehabilitation robots interact with human body,
it is necessary to consider the manipulator and patient
as a coupled mechanical system. The application of force
or position control is not enough to ensure appropri-
ate and safe dynamic interaction between human and
robot [195]. Other control strategies, such as impedance
or admittance control are implemented in most of the
robots for upper limb rehabilitation. In the impedance
control approach the motion of the limb is measured
and the robot provides the corresponding force feed-
back, whereas in the admittance control approach the
force exerted by the user is measured, and the device
generates the corresponding displacement. The advan-
tages and disadvantages of the impedance and admittance
control systems are complementary [196]. In general,
robots with impedance control have stable interaction
but poor accuracy in free-space due to friction. This
low accuracy can be improved using inner loop torque
sensors and low-friction joints or direct drives. Admit-
tance control in contrast compensates the mass and
friction of the device and provides higher accuracy in
non-contact tasks, but can be unstable during dynamic
interactions. This problem is eliminated using SEAs.
Devices using admittance control require also high trans-
mission ratios (e.g. harmonic drives) for precise motion
control [196]. In some cases both of theses approaches
may be combined together. Impedance control strat-
egy has been implemented for example in MIT Manus
[107] (Figure 1B) and L-Exos exoskeleton [197], admit-
tance control is found in MEMOS [132] and iPAM
[126].
Clinical evidence
Clinical studies
As previously discussed, there has been a significant effort
during last two decades to improve the design and con-
trol strategy of robotic rehabilitation devices. Yet, less has
been done to prove the efficacy of such systems in rehabil-
itation settings. Although the results of clinical evaluation
of therapy applying robots are still sparse, the problem
is slowly being recognized. The focus in rehabilitation
robotics is starting to move from technical laboratories to
clinics. References to clinical trials in which robotic reha-
bilitation devices have been used are provided in the last

column of Table 1. The classification of clinical trials used
in this review is summarized in Table 7.
From the developer and manufacturer’s point of view,
there may be at least three objectives in performing clinical
trials. The first one is to address regulatory requirements.
The devices described in this review are considered med-
ical devices in most countries and as such the studies
proving device efficacy and safety may be required before
they are authorized for distribution. Although in some
cases the exemption from providing the clinical data may
be granted, e.g. if the device is recognized as low risk
(Class 1 device in the European Union and the USA) or
if equivalent device has been already approved for com-
mercialization, the clinical data may be required by health
insurance authorities in order to provide reimbursement.
In this case the objective of the trial is to obtain a proof
of clinical or financial benefit of the use of the device
as compared to the existing modes of therapy. The third
objective of clinical trials is to provide the professional
community with the clinical evidence of device’s efficacy.
Although, the three objectives may seem to be similar, the
requirements are not the same, therefore when design-
ing a clinical trial it should be considered if the obtained
results will allow to satisfy requirements of those three
objectives. For the study design requirements to satisfy
the marketing and reimbursement objectives, we refer the
readers to the legal regulations in the country of interest.
Whereas, for a review on the process to design a clinical
train with sound scientific results we refer to Lo [198].
From the clinical point of view, the objective of the
clinical study may be different than to validate a partic-
ular device. For therapists the robotic device is a tool

that provides a therapy protocol rather than an end prod-
uct [198], thus they are rather interested in responses to
questions concerning optimal training intensity, disorders
for which such form of training may be beneficial, and
whether robotic therapy should substitute or complement
other forms of therapy.
This survey includes a search into the US Clinical Trials
database (http://clinicaltrials.gov/) from October 2013
using a combination of keywords: robotic, robot, therapy
and rehabilitation. This is an web-based database existing
since 1997 and maintained by the US National Library of
Medicine at the National Institutes of Health. Under the
American Food and Drug Administration Amendments
Act (FDAAA) of 2007 all the applicable clinical trials (what
concerns category II and III/IV studies in our survey) per-
formed in the USA and starting after 2007 have to be
registered in this database. However, it includes also some
category I studies and many other studies performed in
other countries. Results of this search identified 197 clin-
ical trials out of which 62 are relevant to this survey.
The selected trials are divided into two categories. The
main objective of the first category is to proof the effi-
cacy or safety of the device, therefore there was either
no control group or a control group was undergoing the
standard form of the therapy. The main objective of the
second category is to determine a more efficient form of
the therapy. In the latter category, the participants were
assigned to groups undergoing similar forms of therapy,
but at different intensities, using various devices or under-
going various forms of therapy in different order. A total
of 31 studies aim at device safety or efficacy validation
while 27 address better forms of therapy. A total of four
trials were excluded. The objective of these trials was to
validate other forms of therapy; devices described in this
review have only been used as a reference. As indicated in
Figure 3, the number of participants enrolled in studies for
therapy improvement significantly increased during last
three years compared to the number of participants in
the device safety/efficacy validation studies. This suggests
that the objective of the studies changes from validating
forms of therapy to finding optimal applications methods.
This survey identified a total of 21 devices out of the 58
clinical studies. However, it was not possible to determine
the robotic device in 11 studies. Surprisingly, almost only
stroke survivors (54 studies) were enrolled. In the remain-
ing four studies subjects with cerebral palsy, spinal cord
injury, traumatic brain injury and rotator cuff tear were
involved.
Outcomes of clinical studies
Many questions concerning effective robotic upper-limb
rehabilitation still remain unanswered. One of the most
important reasons is that the most effective interventions
to optimize neural plasticity are still not clear and it is not

possible to implement them in rehabilitation robotics [7].
The other is that the results of the clinical controlled tri-
als remains limited and those already available are difficult
to compare with each other [7,193]. It is also questionable
which measures should be used to evaluate the effects of
therapy and which outcome should be compared: short-
term or long-term. Scales based on evaluation of abili-
ties influencing the quality of life are often not objective
enough, since they rely on therapist expertise.
Although it is not possible to indicate the best con-
trol strategy for the rehabilitation, there is already some
evidence showing that some strategies are producing bet-
ter outcomes, whereas some can even decrease recov-
ery time compared to possible non-robotic strategies
[193].
Most accepted theories about robotic rehabilitation
are clear: The goal of the rehabilitation training is not only
to maximize the number of repetition but to maximize the
patients attention and effort as well [3]. The monotonous
exercises provide worse retention of a skill compared with
alternate training [7]. Adaptive therapy and assistance
as needed provide better results as fixed pattern ther-
apy [193]. Robotic therapy can possibly decrease recovery
if it encourages slacking since the patient may decrease
effort and attention due to the use of adaptive algorithm
[193]. Because learning is error based, faster improve-
ment may be achieved when error is increased [194].
Implicit learning, allowing patients to learn skills without
awareness, may result in greater learning effect [7]. Many
functional gains are more dependent on wrist and hand
movements than on the mobility of shoulder and elbow
[7]. It is not the maximal voluntary contraction (strength
of the muscles) but appropriately timed activity of ago-
nist and antagonist (coordination of the movements) that
significantly improve the rehabilitation [3].
As previously stated, the objective of this report is
not to review the results of clinical studies performed
so far. A detailed review of clinical studies is referenced
in other publications [7,198-202]. The most important
results are still worth mentioning. Systematic review and
meta-analysis of the trials performed in stroke patients
suggest that robotic training improves motor impairment
and strength but do not improve ability to perform ADLs
[199,200]. The results of the first large randomized mul-
ticenter study in which training with MIT-Manus robotic
system have been compared with intensive therapist-
provided therapy and usual care have revealed that there
is no significant difference in the outcomes of the two
intensive forms of the therapy [203]. Thus the most
important advantage of robotic systems is their abil-
ity to provide intensive repetitive training without over-
burdening therapists [204]. Another advantage is the
ability to provide more motivating training context, by
means of a computer gaming environment with quan-
titative feedback to motivate practice [205]. Concerning
cost-effectiveness of robotic rehabilitation, the results of
the previously mentioned multicenter trial have shown
that when the total cost of the therapy is compared, i.e.
the cost of the therapy plus the cost of all the other health
care use, the costs of the two forms of the intensive ther-
apy (i.e. robot-assisted and therapist-provided) are similar
[203]. However, the cost of technology is expected to
decrease, as opposed to the cost of human labor. There-
fore cost-effective advantage toward robot-therapy may be
expected [198].

Conclusions
Due to population changes, shortage of professional ther-
apists, and the increasing scientific and technical poten-
tial, many research groups have proposed devices with
the potential to facilitate the rehabilitation process. Many
devices for upper limb rehabilitation have already been
proposed. A vast majority of these proposed devices are
technically advanced and are designed for clinical set-
tings. However, there is still significant need to improve
efficiency and reduce cost of home-based devices for ther-
apy and ADLs assistance. The effectiveness of robotic
over conventional therapy is arguable and the best ther-
apy strategy is still not clear. The situation may change
soon, because more and more devices are being commer-
cialized and more scientific results will be available. It may
encourage next groups to propose their own solutions.
Developing new devices and improving those already in
the market will be easier, when taking advantage from the
already existing solutions. We hope that this survey will
help to navigate between those solutions and select best of
them, thus facilitating development of new and better sys-
tems for robotic upper limb rehabilitation. We also hope
that it will be a valuable source of information for all the
professionals looking for a comprehensive reference.
