Abstract Dietary fibre is that part of plant material in the
diet which is resistant to enzymatic digestion which
includes cellulose, noncellulosic polysaccharides such as
hemicellulose, pectic substances, gums, mucilages and a
non-carbohydrate component lignin. The diets rich in fibre
such as cereals, nuts, fruits and vegetables have a positive
effect on health since their consumption has been related to
decreased incidence of several diseases. Dietary fibre can
be used in various functional foods like bakery, drinks,
beverages and meat products. Influence of different
processing treatments (like extrusion-cooking, canning,
grinding, boiling, frying) alters the physico- chemical
properties of dietary fibre and improves their functionality.
Dietary fibre can be determined by different methods,
mainly by: enzymic gravimetric and enzymic—chemical
methods. This paper presents the recent developments in
the extraction, applications and functions of dietary fibre in
different food products.

Introduction
Dietary fibre has long history, its term originating with
Hipsley (1953) who coined dietary fibre as a nondigestable
constituents making up the plant cell wall and further its
definition has seen several revisions. Botanists define fibre
as a part of the plant organs, chemical analysts as a group of
chemical compounds, consumer as a substance with
beneficial effects on human health and for the dietetic and
chemical industries dietary fibre is a subject of marketing.
Later dietary fibre was defined as a ubiquitous component
of plant foods and includes materials of diverse chemical
and morphological structure, resistant to the action of
human alimentary enzymes (Kay 1982). The most consis-
tent definition that is now accepted is from Trowell et al.
(1985): “Dietary fibre consists of remnants of plant cells
resistant to hydrolysis (digestion) by the alimentary
enzymes of man”, whose components are hemicellulose,
cellulose, lignin, oligosaccharides, pectins, gums and
waxes.
American Association of Cereal Chemists (AACC) in
2000 defined dietary fibre as the edible parts of plant or
analogous carbohydrates that are resistant to digestion and
absorption in the human small intestine with complete or
partial fermentation in the large intestine. Dietary fibre
includes polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, lignin and
associated plant substances. During the year 2001, Aus-
tralia New Zealand Food Authority (ANZFA) defined
dietary fibre as that fraction of the edible part of plants or
their extracts, or analogous carbohydrates, that are resistant
to digestion and absorption in the human small intestine,
usually with complete or partial fermentation in the large
intestine. The term includes polysaccharides, oligosacchar-
ides and lignins. The panel on the definition of dietary fibre
constituted by National Academy of Science during the
year 2002 defined the dietary fibre complex to include
dietary fibre consisting of non-digestible carbohydrates and
lignin that are intrinsic and intact in plants, functional fibres
consisting of isolated, non digestible carbohydrates which
have beneficial physiological effects in humans and total
fibre as the sum of dietary fibre and functional fibre.

Dietary fibre, although not always defined as such,
has been consumed for centuries and is recognized for
having health benefits. Soluble and insoluble fibres make
up the two basic categories of dietary fibre. Cellulose,
hemicellulose and lignin- are not soluble in water
whereas pectins, gums and mucilages- become gummy
in water.
The importance of food fibres has led to the develop-
ment of a large and potential market for fibre-rich products
and ingredients and in recent years, there is a trend to find
new sources of dietary fibre that can be used in the food
industry (Chau and Huang 2003). Supplementation has
been used to enhance fibre content of foods. Supplemen-
tation has been focused on cookies, crackers and other
cereal-based products, enhancement of fibre content in
snack foods, beverages, spices, imitation cheeses, sauces,
frozen foods, canned meats, meat analogues and other
foods also has been investigated (Hesser 1994).
Classification of dietary fibre
Tungland and Meyer (2002) suggested several different
classification systems to classify the components of dietary
fibre: based on their role in the plant, based on the type of
polysaccharide, based on their simulated gastrointestinal
solubility, based on site of digestion and based on products
of digestion and physiological classification. However,
none is entirely satisfactory, as the limits cannot be
absolutely defined. The most widely accepted classification
for dietary fibre has been to differentiate dietary compo-
nents on their solubility in a buffer at a defined pH, and/or
their fermentability in an invitro system using an aqueous
enzyme solution representative of human alimentary
enzymes. Thus most appropriately dietary fibre is classified
into two categories such as water- insoluble/less fermented
fibres: cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and the water-
soluble/well fermented fibres: pectin, gums and mucilages
(Anita and Abraham 1997). The classification of dietary
fibre components on the basis of water solubility and
fermentability is presented in Table 1.
Cellulose It is the major cell wall component in plants, an
unbranched linear chain of several thousand glucose units
with β-1, 4 glucosidic linkages. Cellulose’s mechanical
strength, resistance to biological degradation, low aqueous
solubility and resistance to acid hydrolysis result from
hydrogen bonding within the microfibrils. Aspinall (1970)
studied that cellulose is insoluble in strong alkali and there
is portion (10–15%) of cellulose, referred to as “amor-
phous”, that is more readily acid hydrolyzed. Cellulose is
not digested to any extent by the enzymes of the human
gastrointestinal system.
Hemicellulose These are cell wall polysaccharides solubi-
lized by aqueous alkali after removal of water soluble and
pectic polysaccharides. They contain backbones of glucose
units with β-1, 4 glucosidic linkages, but differ from
cellulose in that they are smaller in size, contain variety of
sugars and are usually branched (Kay 1982). They contain
mostly xylose and some galactose, mannose, arabinose and
other sugars (Anita and Abraham 1997).
Lignin It is not a polysaccharide but a complex random
polymer containing about 40 oxygenated phenylpropane
units including coniferyl, sinapyl and p-coumaryl alcohols
that have undergone a complex dehydrogenative polymer-
ization (Braums 1952; Schubert 1956; Theander and Aman
1979). Lignins vary in molecular weight and methoxyl
content. Due to strong intramolecular bonding, which
includes carbon to carbon linkages, lignin is very inert.
Lignin demonstrates greater resistance than any other
naturally occurring polymer.
Pectin Pectic substances are a complex group of polysac-
charides in which D-galacturonic acid is a principal constit-
uent. They are structural components of plant cell walls and
also act as intercellular cementing substances. Pectin is highly
water-soluble and is almost completely metabolized by
colonic bacteria. Due to their gelling behaviour, these soluble
polysaccharides may decrease the rate of gastric emptying and
influence small intestinal transit time. This explains their
hypoglycemic properties (Jenkins et al. 1978).
Gums and mucilages These are the types of plant fibres
that are not cell wall components but are formed in
specialized secretory plant cells (Van Denffer et al. 1976).
These are reported to be highly branched polysaccharides
that form gels, bind water and other organic material. Gums
are sticky exudations formed in response to trauma (i.e.
gum arabic). They mainly consist of guar gum and gum
arabic. Guar gum is a galactomannan isolated from the seed
of Cyamopsis tetragonolobus (guar). Partial enzymatic
hydrolysis results in a product that can be used as a soluble
dietary fibre. The physiological effects of this fibre source
comply with what might be expected from a soluble fibre.
Gum arabic is exudated from the acacia tree, is a complex
arabinogalactan polysaccharide in admixture with a glyco-
protein. Mucilages are secreted into the endosperm of plant
seeds where they act to prevent excessive dehydration.
Physico-chemical properties of dietary fibre
Dietary fibre is a complex mixture of polysaccharides with
many different functions and activities as it passes through the
256

gastrointestinal tract. Many of these functions and activities
depend on their physico-chemical properties. Some of these
properties of dietary fibre are discussed below:
Particle size and bulk volume Particle size plays an important
role in controlling a number of events occurring in the digestive
tract i.e. transit time, fermentation, fecal excretion. The range of
particle size depends on the type of cell walls present in the
foods, and on their degree of processing. Particle size of fibre
may vary during transit in the digestive tract as a result of
chewing, grinding and bacterial degradation in the large
intestine. Raghavendra et al. (2006) evaluated the grinding
characteristics of coconut residue and observed that the
reduction in the particle size from 1,127–550 μm resulted in
increased hydration properties, which may be due to increase
in surface area and total pore volume as well as structural
modification. Beyond 550 μm, the hydration properties were
found to decrease with decrease in particle size during
grinding. The fat absorption capacity was also reported to
increase with decrease in particle size.
Surface area characteristics Porosity and available surface
can influence the fermentation of dietary fibre (availability
to microbial degradation in the colon) while the regiochem-
istry of the surface layer may play a role in some
physiochemical properties (adsorption or binding of some
molecules) accounting for some physiological effects of
dietary fibre. The porosity and surface available for bacteria
or molecular probes such as enzymes will depend on the
architecture of the fibre, which is related to its origin and
processing history (Guillon et al. 1998).
Hydration properties The hydration properties partly deter-
mine the fate of dietary fibre in the digestive tract (induction of
fermentation) and account for some of their physiological
effects (fecal bulking of minimally fermented dietary fibre).
Swelling and water retention capacity provide a general view
of fibre hydration and will provide information useful for fibre
supplemented foods. Water absorption provides more infor-
mation on the fibre, in particular its substrate pore volume. It
helps our understanding of the behaviour of fibre in foods or
during gut transit. Processes, such as grinding, drying, heating
or extrusion cooking for example, modifies the physical
properties of the fibre matrix and also affect the hydration
properties (Thibault et al. 1992). The environmental condi-
tions such as temperature, pH, ionic strength, dielectric
constant of the surrounding solution and nature of the ions
can also influence the hydration characteristics of fibre
containing poly-electrolytes (charged groups such as carboxyl
in fibres rich in pectin, carboxyl and sulfate groups in fibres
from algae) (Fleury and Lahaye 1991; Renard et al. 1994).
Camire and Flint (1991) compared the effects of extrusion-
cooking and baking on the dietary fibre composition and
hydration capacity of corn meal, oat meal and potato peels.
They observed an increase in total non-starch polysaccharides
in oat meal and potato peels with both processes, but the ratio
of soluble to insoluble non-starch polysaccharides was higher
in the extruded samples. The process of extrusion also
reported to increase the hydration capacity of corn meal and
oat meal but the hydration capacity of processed potato peels
was observed to be lower than raw peels.
Nassar et al. (2008) analyzed that orange peel and pulp
had high amount of dietary fibre (78.87 and 70.64%) with
more proportion of insoluble dietary fibre, high level of
water and oil holding capacity. Incorporation of orange peel
and pulp in biscuit formulation showed an increase in water
absorption, dough development time and stability, while
mixing tolerance was decreased.

Solubility and viscosity Solubility has profound effects on
fibre functionality. It is also well established that soluble
viscous polysaccharides can impede the digestion and
absorption of nutrients from the gut. If the polysaccharide
structure is such that molecules fit together in a crystalline
array, the polymer is likely to be energetically more stable
in the solid state than in solution (Guillon and Champ
2000). More branching (like gum acacia), the presence of
ionic groups (e.g. pectin methoxylation) and the potential
for inter unit positional bonding (like β-glucans with mixed
β-1-3 and β-1-4 linkages) increases the solubility. Alter-
ations of the monosaccharide units or their molecular form
(α- or β- form) further increases solubility (for example,
gum acacia, arabinogalactan and xanthan gum).
Aravantinos-Zafiris et al. (1994) proposed orange peel
residues to be good source of dietary fibre. After pectin
extraction of orange peels by nitric acid, orange peel
residue was extracted once with ethanol and five times
with water at 30 °C for 30 min. The fibre fraction (ff)
obtained contained 213 g/kg soluble and 626 g/kg of
insoluble dietary fibre on a dry basis. It was observed that
fibre fraction had comparable water and oil absorption
capacities with commercial fibre products.
Fuentes-Alventosa et al. (2009) prepared high dietary
fibre powders from asparagus by-products and analyzed its
chemical composition and functional characteristics. Fac-
tors such as extraction treatment (intense, 90 min at 60 °C
or gentle 1 min at room temperature), solvent extraction
(water or 96% ethanol) and drying system (freeze drying or
oven treatment at 60 °C for 16 h) were studied for
extraction. Intense treatment in water was found to contain
highest dietary fibre content and lowest was found in fibres
gently extracted in ethanol. The drying system employed
also affected fibre surfaces. Solubility and oil holding
capacity of freeze-dried fibre was observed to be higher
than oven-dried fibres.
The viscosity of the fluid can be roughly described as its
resistance to flow. Generally, as the molecular weight or
chain length of fibre increases, the viscosity of fibre in
solution increases. However, the concentration of the fibre
in solution, the temperature, pH, shear conditions of
processing and ionic strength all substantially depend on
the fibre used. Primarily, long chain polymers, such as the
gums (guar gum, tragacanth gum) bind significant water
and exhibit high solution viscosity. However, in general,
highly soluble fibres, that are highly branched or are
relatively short chain polymers such as gum arabic have
low viscosities.
The effect of wheat bran (natural and toasted) and
flavour (pineapple and pina colada) on yogurt quality was
studied by Aportela-Palacios et al. (2005). It was observed
that the pH increased and syneresis decreased with
increasing fibre (1.5, 3.0 and 4.5% by weight). Natural
bran had a greater effect on consistency than the toasted
bran and the yogurt flavoured with pina colada had higher
viscosity than yogurt flavoured with pineapple.
Garcia-Perez et al. (2005) reported that yogurt contain-
ing 1% orange fibre had a lighter, more red and yellow
colour and showed lower syneresis than the control and
yogurt containing 0.6% and 0.8% orange fibre. Addition of
0.5% barley β- glucan or inulin and guar gum (>2%) were
effective in improving serum retention and viscoelastic
properties of low-fat yogurt (Brennan and Tudorica 2008).
Incorporation of fibre obtained from asparagus shoots
increased yogurt consistency and imparted a yellowish-
greenish colour to the yogurt (Sanz et al. 2008).
Adsorption/binding of ions and organic molecules Fibre has
been suspected of impairing mineral absorption because
charged polysaccharide (such as pectins through their carbox-
yl groups) and associated substances such as phytates in cereal
fibres have been shown invitro to bind metal ions. Charged
polysaccharides do not have effect on mineral and trace
element absorption while associated substances such as
phytates can have a negative effect. The ability of various
fibres to sequester and even chemically bind bile acids has
been suggested as a potential mechanism by which certain
dietary fibres rich in uronic acids and phenolic compounds
may have a hypocholesterolemic action. The environmental
conditions (duration of exposure, pH) the physical and
chemical forms of fibres and nature of bile acids may
influence the adsorption capacity of fibre (Dongowski and
Ehwald 1998; Thibault et al. 1992).
Dietary fibre content in various foods
Dietary fibre is naturally present in cereals, vegetables,
fruits and nuts. The amount and composition of fibres differ
from food to food (Desmedt and Jacobs 2001). A fibre-rich
diet is lower in energy density, often has a lower fat
content, is larger in volume and is richer in micronutrients.
This larger mass of food takes longer to eat and its presence
in the stomach may bring a feeling of satiety sooner,
although this feeling of fullness is short term (Rolls et al.
1999). It is suggested that healthy adults should eat between
20 and 35 g of dietary fibre each day. Several non-starch
food provide up to 20–35 g of fibre/100 g dry weight and
other those containing starch provide about 10 g/100 g of
dry weight and the content of fibre of fruits and vegetables
is 1.5–2.5 g/100 g of dry weight (Selvendran and Robertson
1994). Lambo et al. (2005) reported, cereals to be one of
the main sources of dietary fibre, contributing to about 50%
of the fibre intake in western countries, 30–40% dietary
fibre may come from vegetables, about 16% from fruits and
258

----- Page 5 (native) -----
the remaining 3% from other minor sources. Dietary fibre
content of various food sources is presented in Table 2.
Methods of analysis of dietary fibre
Fibre concentration has been a useful measure for describ-
ing feeds and estimation energy values for nearly 150 years.
Numerous methods have been proposed for measuring
dietary fibre and some have become routine analysis for
research and practical use (Mertens 2003).
Later the proximate analysis system for seeds was
developed. The carbohydrate content of a sample was
determined by difference. Methods were available for the
measurement of water, lipids but an insoluble fibrous
fraction was identified that was not digested. This observa-
tion led to the development of crude fibre method using
successive acid and alkaline digestion to isolate the
indigestible fraction. The neutral detergent fibre method
(Goering and Van Soest 1970) measuring insoluble fibre
and lignin provided the first reliable analytical tool for
estimating these major portions of dietary fibre. This
technique, however, uses insensitive gravimetric measure-
ments and is unsuited for foods rich in soluble fibre.
Crude fibre measurements, used for many years to
estimate fibre content grossly underestimate the fibre
content of human foods. It was observed that crude fibre
values do not show the real percentage of the food that is
unavailable to man. During chemical treatments for the
estimation of crude fibre great loss in fibre material takes
place. Thus a simple invitro method using pepsin and
pancreatin was proposed for the determination of the
indigestible residue (dietary fibre) content of human body.
The use of pepsin and pancreatin gave maximal digestion
of protein and starch, and consequently a minimal residue
was obtained. The authors concluded that the dietary fibre
determination should be based on the use of alimentary
digestive enzymes (Hellendoorn et al. 1975).
The Southgate technique (Southgate 1976) extracts both
soluble and insoluble fibres for analysis and includes lignin
estimations, but it uses rather inaccurate calorimetric
techniques for sugar analysis and does not completely
eliminate starch from some foods. The method of Theander
and Aman (1979) may provide one of the best available
techniques for measuring total, soluble and insoluble fibre,
but it does not separate cellulose from insoluble non
cellulose polysaccharides. A number of methods of analysis
for dietary fibres have been used in the UK over the years
for the purpose of food nutrition labeling.
Englyst et al. (1982) modified the Southgate extraction
technique and applied direct sugar measurements by gas-
liquid chromatography to greatly improve the specificity of
this technique. However, this method does not measure

lignin and uses indirect measurement-by-difference techni-
ques to estimate certain fractions.
Recent development in dietary fibre methodology has
adopted two general approaches (Asp 2001): enzymic-
gravimetric and enzymic- chemical methods.
Enzymic-gravimetric methods It involves enzymic treat-
ments for starch and protein removal, precipitation of
soluble fibre components by aqueous ethanol, isolation
and weighing of the dietary fibre residue and correction for
protein and ash in the residue (Asp and Johansson 1981;
Asp et al. 1992).
Enzymic-chemical methods This method involves enzymic
removal of starch, precipitation with 80% (v/v) ethanol to
separate the soluble dietary fibre polysaccharides from low-
molecular weight sugars and starch hydrolysis products.
Schweizer and Wursch (1979) employed GLC method for
the characterization of gravimetrically determined soluble
dietary fibre residues.
Graham et al. (1988) examined the influence of
extraction conditions on the solubility of dietary fibre in
four cereals (wheat, rye, barley and oats) and four
vegetables (potato, carrot, lettuce and pea). The extraction
conditions examined were: a) pH 5.0 acetate buffer at 96 °C
for 1 h and 60 °C for 4 h during starch degradation, b)
water at 38 °C for 2 h, c) pH 1.5 HCl/KCl buffer at 38 °C
for 2 h and d) pretreatment with absolute ethanol at 96 °C
for 1 h and extraction with water at 38 °C for 2 h. It was
observed that the extraction at high temperature gave the
highest values for soluble fibre whereas the extraction in
the acidic buffer gave the lowest value. The yield and
composition of soluble fibre varied considerably with
extraction conditions and food sample. The use of
standardized and physiologically more appropriate extrac-
tion conditions was proposed.
LaCourse et al. (1994) derived a method for extracting
the tapioca pulp fibre that is a by-product of tapioca starch
milling operation. The process involves forming a slurry of
5–10% by weight of ground tapioca pulp in an aqueous
media, enzymatically treating the slurry with a 1,4-α-D-
glycosidase to depolymerise starch to yield a tapioca fibre
comprising at least 70% total dietary fibre, of which at least
12% is soluble fibre.
Garcimartin et al. (1995) compared the results of the two
methods: the official AOAC method and the modified
method of Englyst for evaluation of dietary fibre in ready
salted potato crisps. The AOAC method is an enzymatic-
gravimetric procedure to determine the total dietary fibre
(TDF). The Englyst method involves enzymatic-chemical
extraction and fractionation of the non-starch polysaccha-
ride (NSP) and their subsequent determination as neutral
sugars by GLC. The AOAC method gave a higher fibre
value than the Englyst method due to a contribution from
retrograded starch. The authors concluded that Englyst
method is laborious, time consuming and gives information
about the properties of the different types of DF which are
not required for routine analysis whereas AOAC method is
faster and easier to carry out and does not overestimate
dietary fibre, if the resistant starch is regarded as part of it.
Almazan and Zhou (1995) studied the effect of reducing
ethanol concentration from 76% to 41–56% for the
precipitation of soluble dietary fibre in the AOAC
enzymatic-gravimetric method 985.29. The reduction in
ethanol volume for determining the TDF of raw collard,
mustard greens, sweet potato (leaves and roots) and sugar
beet (leaves and roots) was not observed to be different
from the TDF contents of the vegetables determined from
those AOAC recommended volume (P<0.05). Rather
ethanol concentration reduction lowers the analysis cost,
lessen environmental organic solvent contamination and
shorten filtration time.
Perez-Hidalgo et al. (1997) compared manual procedures
with Dosi- fibre instrument for determination of acid
detergent fibre (ADF) in kidney bean samples. The ADF
results obtained by manual (9.83%) and automatic (9.13%)
procedure showed statistical difference (p<0.05). It was
attributed to have better digestion with Dosi-fibre appara-
tus. The authors also determined insoluble dietary fibre
content of raw chick peas, kidney beans and lentil samples
by enzymatic modification of detergent method (ENDF)
and compared the results with AOAC method. In case of
lentils and chick peas statistically significant difference (p<
0.001) was obtained. However, in case of insoluble dietary
fibre in kidney beans, both the methods resulted in non-
significant difference.
Nawirska and Uklanska (2008) investigated and com-
pared the neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and acid dietary
fibre (ADF) contents of the pomace obtained from the fruit
and vegetable processing. Of the pomace samples exam-
ined, those of chokeberry pomace were observed to be
richest in dietary fibre, containing the highest amounts of

NDF (87.49/100 g DM) and ADF (57.24 g/100 g DM). The
authors recommended that the pomace from chokeberry,
black currant and strawberries can be utilized for the
industrial production of DF-rich concentrates, thus mini-
mizing the waste products from fruit and vegetable
processing.
Therapeutic functions of dietary fibre
The diets with a high content of fibre, such as those rich in
cereals, fruits and vegetables have a positive effect on
health since their consumption has been related to a
decreased incidence of several types of diseases as due to
its beneficial effects like increasing the volume of fecal
bulk, decreasing the time of intestinal transit, cholesterol
and glycaemic levels, trapping substances that can be
dangerous for the human organism (mutagenic and carci-
nogenic agents), stimulating the proliferation of the
intestinal flora etc. (Heredia et al. 2002; Beecher 1999).
Some functions and benefits of dietary fibre on human
health are summarized in Table 3.
Dietary fibre has established effects on stool and
consistency. Thus the mechanism by which stool bulk and
laxation is promoted varies for different fibres. Guar gum is
readily fermented by the human fecal microbiota (Salyers et
al. 1977), improves bowel functioning and relieves consti-
pation in patients (Takahashi et al. 1994). Available
information also indicates that the incidence of diverticular
disease is low in populations ingesting fibre (Painter and
Burkitt 1971) both in vegetarians and non-vegetarians
(Gear et al. 1979). It has been postulated that the fibre
may act as a protective factor in cancer of the large bowel
by shortening transit time, thus reducing the time for
formation and action of carcinogens. In addition, through
its stool-bulking effect, fibre may lower the concentration
of fecal carcinogens thereby reducing the amount of
carcinogen that comes in contact with the gut wall (Hill
1974; Burkitt 1975). Graham et al. (1978) reported that the
ingestion of certain fibre-rich vegetables was inversely
related to the frequency of large bowel cancer.
Improvements in diabetic control and reduction in
insulin and sulfonylurea requirements have been reported
in both mild (Kiehm et al. 1976; Kay et al. 1981) and
moderate (Albrink et al. 1979; Rivellese et al. 1980)
diabetics on high fibre diets containing a normal (Miranda
and Horwitz 1978; Simpson et al. 1981; Walker 1975) or
high (Kiehm et al. 1976; Simpson et al. 1979, 1981;
Anderson and Ward 1979) proportion of carbohydrate. It
was suggested that the large amount of fibre from fruit,
vegetable and legumes is partly responsible for the low
levels of plasma cholesterol (Anderson et al. 1973). Morris
et al. (1977) observed an inverse relationship between
cereal fibre intake and death from coronary disease in a
retrospective study. A variety of fibre rich foods such as
wheat straw, oats, soy bran, rice bran, apples, legumes,
mucilaginous fibre (Heller et al. 1980) were shown to
reduce the atherogenicity of semi-synthetic diets with or
without added fat and sterol. Pectin (Kay and Truswell
1977), guar gum and gum arabic also show a hypolipidic
effect in humans, lowering both serum cholesterol and
triglycerides (Takahashi et al. 1993).
Effect of processing on the dietary fibre content of food
The physico-chemical properties of fibre can be manipu-
lated through treatments: chemical, enzymatic, mechanical
(grinding), thermal or thermo mechanical (extrusion,
cooked-extrusion, and controlled instantaneous decompres-
sion) to improve their functionality (Guillon and Champ
2000). For example, mechanical energy can also have
profound effects on polysaccharides (Poutanen et al. 1998).
Grinding may affect the hydration properties, in particular,
the kinetics of water uptake as the result of the increase of
surface area, the fibres hydrate more rapidly. Heating
generally changes the ratio soluble to insoluble fibre.

Combination of thermal and mechanical energy can change
dramatically the structure of dietary fibre at all structural
level leading possibly to new functional properties.
Simple processes such as soaking and cooking tend to
modify the composition and availability of nutrients. They
also modify the plant cell wall material that may have
important physiological effects (Spiller 1986; Roehrig
1988). In wheat bran it has been found that thermal
treatments (boiling, cooking or roasting) originate an
increase of total fibre that is not due to new synthesis, but
rather to the formation of fibre-protein complexes that are
resistant to heating and are quantified as dietary fibre
(Caprez et al. 1986).
Processing required to make some vegetables and
legumes (chick-pea, bean, lentil etc.) suitable for eating
causes a decrease of several components of the fibre. For
example, during cooking of lentils previously dipped, the
quantity of fibre diminishes, fundamentally due to great
decrease in hemicelluloses (Vidal-Valverde and Frias 1991;
Vidal-Valverde et al. 1992). Tatjana et al. (2002) studied the
modifications that happen during the thermal processing of
kidney beans and reported that the solubilization of the
polysaccharides resulted in decreased total fibre content
mainly due to loss of soluble fibre.
The effect of thermal treatment (including extrusion
cooking, boiling and frying) on the dietary fibre composi-
tion of cereals and potato samples were studied by Varo et
al. (1983) at 8 laboratories using different analytical
methods, reported that heat treated potato samples
contained more water insoluble dietary fibre and less starch
than raw samples. No changes were observed in the
amounts of dietary fibres and starch in the extruded
samples.
Herranz et al. (1983) studied the neutral detergent fibre
(NDF), acid detergent fibre (ADF), cellulose, hemicellulose
and lignin content of five frozen vegetables (raw and
boiled) and five canned vegetables (two of them fried). It
was observed that boiling resulted in an increase in the
NDF, ADF and cellulose contents. A slight increase in
hemicelluloses and no change in lignin values were
observed. When cooking process was frying a drastic
decrease in NDF, ADF, cellulose and lignin content with
slight change in hemicellulose was reported.
Penner and Kim (1991) analyzed the non-starch poly-
saccharide (NSP) fractions of raw, processed and cooked
carrots and resulted that processing and simulated home-
cooking of raw carrots shows an increased amount of NSP/
unit dry weight. Cooking of canned carrots resulted in the
largest increase in total and soluble NSP/unit dry weight
were not as great when compared on wet weight basis.
The effect of domestic cooking on dietary fibre and
starch composition of processed potato products were
evaluated by Thed and Phillips (1995) and reported that
microwave heating and deep fat frying reduces an appre-
ciable amount if in-vitro digestible starch and significantly
increases both the resistant starch (RS) and water-insoluble
dietary fibre (IDF). They reported that water-soluble dietary
fibre content was not affected by any of the domestic
cooking methods. The resulted increase in IDF was due to
some of the starch in cooked potato had become indigest-
ible by amylopectin enzymes and RS was considered to be
the observed increment in the IDF fraction.
Cammire et al. (1997) also carried out studies on
differences in the dietary fibre composition of potato peels
as affected by different method of peeling (abrasion and
steam peeling) and extrusion cooking. They reported that
extrusion was associated with an increase in total dietary
fibre contents and decrease in starch content in steam peels.
Lignin content was reported to decrease but total dietary
fibre content was unaffected in extruded abrasive peels.
Soluble non-starch polysaccharides were reported to in-
crease in both types of peels as a result of extrusion.
Chopra et al. (2009) studied the effect of soaking on
insoluble, soluble and total dietary fibre of Bengal gram,
cow pea, dry pea, field bean and green gram. Samples were
soaked in tap water (1:2 ratio) for 12 h at room temperature
(29–31 °C). Soaking increased total dietary fibre by 1.2–
8.2% and a considerable increase in soluble dietary fibre
was observed.
Application of dietary fibre in functional foods
Fibre in foods can change their consistency, texture,
rheological behavior and sensory characteristic of the end
products, the emergence of novel sources of fibres, have
been offering new opportunities in their use in food
industry (Guillon and Champ 2000). Fibre can even be
produced from sources that might otherwise be considered
waste products. For example, wheat straw, soy hulls, oat
hulls, peanut and almond skins, corn stalks and cobs, spent
brewer’s grain and waste portions of fruits and vegetables
processed in large quantities can be converted into fibre
ingredients, which may be highly functional in certain food
applications (Katz 1996). Dietary fibre holds all the
characteristics required to be considered as an important
ingredient in the formulation of functional foods, due to its
beneficial health effects.
Among foods enriched in fibre, the most known and
consumed are breakfast cereals and bakery products such as
integral breads and cookies (Cho and Prosky 1999; Nelson
2001), as well as milk and meat derived products. Tudoric
et al. (2002) observed that the addition of soluble and
insoluble dietary fibre ingredients influenced the overall
quality (biochemical composition, cooking properties and
textural characteristics) of both raw and cooked pasta.

J Food Sci Technol (May–June 2012) 49(3):255–266

Glucose release is also significantly reduced by the addition
of soluble dietary fibre. For pastas, the anti sticking
characteristics of certain fibres of oats, barley, soy, rice
bran etc. help to facilitate the extrusion process and may
also contribute to dough strength or improves steam table
life of the cooked pasta. Addition of gums to certain Asian
noodle products make the noodles firmer and easier to
rehydrate upon cooking or soaking (Hou and Kruk 1998).
In bread making, the incorporation of fibre ingredients
reported to increase the water hydration values of flour.
Toma et al. (1979) studied that the bread with potato peel
instead of wheat bran was superior in the contents of certain
minerals, in total dietary fibre, in water-holding capacity, in
its lower quantity of starchy components and its lack of
phytate. Cakes prepared from 25% apple pomace and wheat
flour blend had high acceptable quality. Addition of apple
pomace also avoids the use of any other flavouring
ingredients as it had already a pleasant fruity flavour
(Sudha et al. 2007).
Nassar et al. (2008) suggested that 15% of orange peel
and pulp could be incorporated as an ingredient in making
biscuits, as they are a suitable source of dietary fibre with
associated bioactive compounds (flavonoids, carotenoids
etc.). The addition of dietary fibre to bakery products also
improves their nutritional quality since it makes possible to
decrease the fat content, by using dietary fibre as
substitutive of fat without loss of quality (Byrne 1997;
Martin 1999). Sharif et al. (2009) concluded that replace-
ment of wheat flour with defatted rice bran could be used
without adversely affecting physical and sensory character-
istics of cookies. Rice bran supplementation significantly
improved the dietary fibre, mineral and protein content of
the cookies and moreover, cost of production was also
reduced with proportionate increase of supplementation. Ice
creams and frozen yogurts have higher fat levels, which
have its particular functionalities. Addition of fibre ingre-
dients such as alginates, guar gums and cellulose gels not
only replaces fat but also serves to provide viscosity,
improve emulsion, foam, freeze/thaw stability, control
melting properties, reduce syneresis, promotes formation
of smaller ice crystals and facilitate extrusion (Alexander
1997). Guar gum, pectins and inulin are also added during
cheese processing to decrease its% fat without losing its
organoleptic characteristics, such as texture and flavour.
In case of beverages and drinks, the addition of dietary
fibre increases their viscosity and stability, soluble fibre being
the most used because it is more dispersible in water than
insoluble fibre. Some examples of soluble fibres are those
from fractions of grains and multi-fruits (Bollinger 2001),
pectins (Bjerrum 1996), β-glucans, cellulose beet-root fibre
(Nelson 2001). Oat fibre can be incorporated into milk
shakes, instant type-breakfast drinks, fruit and vegetable
juices, ice tea, sports drinks, cappuccino and wine. Other
beverages that can benefit from the addition of fibre include
liquid diet beverages- both those created for people with
special dietary needs as well as weight loss or meal-
replacement beverages (Hegenbart 1995). Larrauri et al.
(1995) described the manufacture of powdered drink
containing dietary fibre from pineapple peel. The product,
called FIBRALAX, contained 25% dietary fibre and 66.2%
digestible carbohydrates, and provided a mild laxative effect.
Some types of soluble fibres, such as pectins, inulin,
guar gum and carboxymethyl-cellulose, are utilized as
functional ingredients in the milk products (Nelson 2001).
Fermented milk enriched with citrus fibre (orange and
lemon) had good acceptability (Sendra et al. 2008). Staffolo
et al. (2004) observed the yogurt fortified with 1.3% wheat,
bamboo, inulin and apple fibres appeared to be promising
avenue for increased fibre intake, with higher consumer
acceptability. Hashim et al. (2009) studied the effect of
fortification with date fibre, a by-product of date syrup
production, on fresh yogurt. Control yogurt (without fibre),
yogurt fortified with 1.5, 3.0 and 4.5% date fibre and
yogurt with 1.5% wheat bran were prepared. Yogurt
fortified with 3% date fibre resulted with similar sourness,
sweetness, firmness, smoothness and overall acceptability
as the control yogurt. As both fibre and yogurt are well
known for their beneficial health effects, together will
constitute a functional food with commercial applications.
Dietary fibres based on pectins, cellulose, soy, wheat,
maize or rice isolates and beet fibre can be used for
improving the texture of meat products, such as sausages,
salami and at the same time, are adequate to prepare low-fat
products, such as ‘Dietetic hamburgers’. Also, since they
have the ability of increasing the water retention capacity,
their inclusion in the meat matrix contributes to maintain its
juiciness (Chevance et al. 2000; Mansour and Khalil 1999).
In the production of synthetic meats (meat analogs from
plant protein), addition of psyllium mucilloid aids in
modifying the texture to impart a meat- like chewiness
(Chan and Wypyszyk 1988).
Oat bran or oat fibre appears to be suitable fat
replacement in ground beef and pork sausage products
due to its ability to retain water and emulate particle
definition in ground meat in terms of both colour and
texture (Verma and Banerjee 2010). In an attempt to
develop low salt, low fat and high fibre functional chicken
nuggets, Verma et al. (2009) incorporated various fibre
sources like, pea hull flour, gram hull flour, apple pulp and
bottle gourd in different combinations at 10% level.
Conclusion
The plant material in diet resistant to enzymatic digestion is
termed as dietary fibre. It includes cellulose, hemicellulose,

pectic substances, gums, mucilages and lignin etc. Dietary
fibre is naturally present in cereals, fruits, vegetables and
nuts. The physico-chemical properties, methods of analysis
and therapeutic functions of dietary fibre are discussed in
this paper. The diets with high content of fibre have been
reported to have a positive effect on health. During
processing the foods undergo various physical, chemical,
enzymatic and thermal treatments, which directly or
indirectly effect the composition of total fiber. Incorpora-
tion of fibre can change the consistency, texture, rheological
behaviour and sensory attributes of the end products.
Addition of fibre in breakfast cereals, bread, cookies, cakes,
yogurt, beverages and meat products has been reported with
favourable results. Studies on changes in fibre during
various unit operations, extraction and characterization of
fibre from non-food sources and development of fibre
enriched products at economical cost need immediate
attention.
