PD-1 is a receptor of the Ig superfamily that negatively regulates
T cell antigen receptor signaling by interacting with the speciﬁc
ligands (PD-L) and is suggested to play a role in the maintenance
of self-tolerance. In the present study, we examined possible roles
of the PD-1PD-L system in tumor immunity. Transgenic expression
of PD-L1, one of the PD-L, in P815 tumor cells rendered them less
susceptible to the speciﬁc T cell antigen receptor-mediated lysis by
cytotoxic T cells in vitro, and markedly enhanced their tumorigen-
esis and invasiveness in vivo in the syngeneic hosts as compared
with the parental tumor cells that lacked endogenous PD-L. Both
effects could be reversed by anti-PD-L1 Ab. Survey of murine tumor
lines revealed that all of the myeloma cell lines examined naturally
expressed PD-L1. Growth of the myeloma cells in normal syngeneic
mice was inhibited signiﬁcantly albeit transiently by the adminis-
tration of anti-PD-L1 Ab in vivo and was suppressed completely in
the syngeneic PD-1-deﬁcient mice. These results suggest that the
expression of PD-L1 can serve as a potent mechanism for poten-
tially immunogenic tumors to escape from host immune responses
and that blockade of interaction between PD-1 and PD-L may
provide a promising strategy for speciﬁc tumor immunotherapy.
A
ntigen-induced activation and proliferation of T cells are
regulated by both positive and negative costimulatory re-
ceptors belonging to the Ig superfamily. CD28 and ICOS are
positive costimulatory receptors interacting with the ligands of
B7 family on professional antigen-presenting cells and are
essential for activation and proliferation of antigen-specific T
cells (1, 2). By contrast, two distinct receptors on T cells,
cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-A-4 and -PD-1, play opposite
roles. CTLA-4 shares the B7 ligands with CD28 (3), and CLTA-4
gene targeted mice develop fatal polyclonal proliferation of T
cells early in life (4), indicating a pivotal role in restricting T cell
expansion during normal immune response. PD-1, on the other
hand, interacts with distinct ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, which
are expressed not only on antigen-presenting cells but also other
cell types in nonlymphoid tissues (5, 6). Although PD-1 gene-
targeted mice show only marginal lymphoproliferation (7), they
develop various autoimmune diseases later in life, suggesting the
involvement of PD-1 in suppressing activation andor prolifer-
ation of autoreactive T cells (8, 9). These results suggest that the
two types of negative receptors may in part control different
aspects or stages of immune responses.
Accumulating evidence indicates that specific T cell immune
response can be raised against many tumors in human and mouse
based on recent sensitive assay systems (10, 11). It is also shown
that unaltered self-antigens expressed either aberrantly or in a
tissue-specific manner on tumor cells can serve as major tumor
rejection antigens, suggesting that antitumor immunity may be in
part autoreactive response (12). Nonetheless, tumor-specific
immune responses are normally very weak, if present at all, and
not sufficient enough to eradicate the tumors. Identification of
negative immunoreceptors on T cells, however, has provided a
novel prospect that their manipulation may lead to the enhanced
tumor-specific T cell immunity in vivo. Indeed, blockade of
CTLA-4 was indicated to augment the specific tumor immunity
and to induce significant inhibition of tumors in vivo in a number
of experimental murine models (13).
Unlike B7 molecules, PD-1 ligands (PD-Ls) are expressed on
various nonlymphoid tissues in mouse such as heart, lung, liver,
and kidney (5, 6). It is speculated that PD-Ls expressed on these
vital tissues may function in part as ‘‘veto’’ molecules against the
potentially autoreactive effector T cells (14). In this report, we
explored the possibility for involvement of PD-1PD-L1 system
in tumor immunity by using experimental tumor models. We
indicate that PD-L1 on inherently immunogenic tumor cells
confers a potent escaping mechanism from the host T cell
immunity and raise a possibility that blockade of PD-1–PD-L
interaction may provide an effective approach for specific tumor
immunotherapy.
Materials and Methods
Mice. BALBc, BALBc nunu, DBA2, and C57BL6 (B6)
mice were purchased from Japan Clea, Hamamatsu, Japan.
PD-1-deficient mice that had been backcrossed with B6 or
BALBc mice for over 15 generations were maintained in our
animal facility in a specific pathogen-free condition.
Cells and Cultures. Mouse tumor cell lines, P815 (mastocytoma),
B16 (melamoma), SP20, P3U1, X63, J558L, and PAI (myelo-
maplasmocytomas), were maintained in the complete RPMI
1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 105 M 2-mercap-
toethanol and antibiotics. An allo (H-2Ld)-reactive cytotoxic T
cell clone 2C derived from 2C-transgenic B6 mice was kindly
provided by K. Udaka, Graduate School of Science, Kyoto
University, and maintained in the complete RPMI 1640 medium
supplemented with 5% rat ConA-conditioned medium by stim-
ulating every 10–12 days with 100 Gy-irradiated P815 cells. To
generate the syngeneic tumor-specific CTL, DBA2 mice were
injected i.p. with 100 Gy-irradiated P815 cells (5  106) at 2 wk
apart, and the spleen cells were restimulated in vitro with
irradiated P815 cells for 6 d followed by a limiting dilution in the
presence of irradiated P815 cells, syngeneic splenocytes, and 25
unitsml human IL-2.
Abs and Flow-Cytometric Analysis. Rat anti-mouse PD-1 and
PD-L1 mAb were established as described (15, 16), and anti-H-
2Ld was purchased from e-Bioscience (San Diego, CA). Flow
cytometric analysis was done with a FACScan (Becton Dickin-
son) as described (7).
Gene Transfection. A PD-L1 cDNA kindly provided by G. J.
Freeman (Harvard Medical School, Boston) was digested with

EcoRI and constructed into a pApuroXS expression vector.
P815 cells were transfected with the pApuroXS-PD-L1 by elec-
troporation at 360 V, 500 F, followed by the selection with
puromycin (3 gml), and independent clones stably expressing
PD-L1 were established.
Cytotoxicity and IFN Assay. Cytotoxicity assay was done with a
51Cr-release assay as described (17), and IFN- was assayed by
using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (e-Bioscience)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Assay of Tumor Growth and Ab Treatment. To assess the tumor
growth, tumor diameters were measured with calipers, and
tumor volumes were approximated by the calculation as reported
(18). For the treatment with Ab, anti-mouse PD-L1 mAb or
normal rat IgG as a control was injected i.p. at 0.1 mg per mouse
each time on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 after the tumor inoculation.
Histological Analysis. DBA2 mice inoculated with P815PD-L1
tumor cells were killed at day 20, and the tissues were fixed in
10% formaldehyde, mounted in paraffin, and stained with
hematoxylin and eosin.
Results and Discussion
In an attempt to explore the possible roles of PD-1 receptor in
the effector function of T cells, we first examined whether the
engagement of PD-1 receptor affects the cytotoxic activity of a
B6-derived H-2Ld-specific CTL clone, 2C (19). 2C CTL clone
expressed significant PD-1 on stimulation with the specific
target, P815 tumor cells (Fig. 1A). Because P815 cells expressed
neither PD-L1 (Fig. 1B) nor PD-L2 (data not shown), we
established three independent P815 transfectants stably express-
ing PD-L1. All of the P815PD-L1 clones expressed the same
level of H-2Ld antigen (Fig. 1B) and proliferated at the same rate
in the culture as the parental cells. However, as shown in Fig. 1C,
the P815PD-L1 clones were less susceptible to the cytotoxic
activity of 2C CTL than the parental P815 cells. The reduced
susceptibility of P815PD-L1 clone to 2C CTL was reversed
almost completely by the inclusion of anti-PD-L1 mAb F(ab)2
in the assay culture (10 gml), indicating that it was not due to
an inherent property of the clone. The results suggested strongly
that the engagement of PD-1 of CTL with PD-L1 on the specific
target cells resulted in the inhibition of T cell receptor-mediated
cytotoxic activity.
Because P815 tumor cells exhibit significant T cell immuno-
genicity, yet forms potentially lethal tumors in the syngeneic
DBA2 mice depending on the loading doses, it has been used
as a model of tumor immunity for years. Several distinct rejection
antigens recognized by the specific cytotoxic T cells in the
syngeneic mice have been identified in P815 cells, including P1A
antigen shared with various other tumor cells (20–22). We then
compared the tumorigenesis of P815 and P815PD-L1 cells in
the syngeneic DBA2 mice. P815 cells inoculated s.c. at 1  106
cells per mouse formed only transient local tumors (Fig. 2A Left),
although 70% of the mice eventually died in 6–7 wk because of
latent i.p. dissemination of the tumor cells (Fig. 2B). The rest
30% of mice were apparently cured of tumors. On the other
hand, P815PD-L1 cells at the same dose formed progressive
local tumors (Fig. 2A Left) and killed 100% of mice in as early
as 2–4 wk (Fig. 2B). Autopsy examination revealed early invasion
of the s.c. P815PD-L1 cells into the peritoneal cavity across the
abdominal wall and widespread dissemination into the abdom-
inal cavity as well as the probable bloodborne metastasis in the
livers and spleens (Fig. 2C). In the H-2-identical BALBc nunu
mice, however, both P815 and P815PD-L1 tumor cells formed
rapidly growing tumors with only marginal, if any, difference

cytometry. Although not shown, none of the cells expressed PD-L2. (C) 2C cells were incubated with 51Cr-labeled P815 (E) or three independent P815PD-L1 clones

determined. The means and SE of triplicate cultures are indicated.

(Fig. 2A Right) and killed them within 4 wk. The results indicated
that the enhanced tumorigenicity of P815PD-L1 cells in the
normal syngeneic mice depended on the T cells.
Conforming to the inherent T cell immunogenicity of P815
cells, tumor-specific CD8 CTL could be induced from the
spleen cells of DBA2 mice immunized with P815 cells, and they
expressed significant PD-1 (Fig. 3A). The syngeneic CTL again
exhibited less efficient cytotoxicity as well as IFN- production
against P815PD-L1 than P815 cells, and the reduced IFN-
production in response to P815PD-L1 cells was restored by the
inclusion of anti-PD-L1 mAb F(ab)2 (Fig. 3A). The results
confirmed that PD-L1 on the tumor cells significantly inhibited
the activation of specific T cells in the syngeneic mice by the
tumor antigens. To prove a direct role of PD-L1 in the enhanced
tumorigenicity of P815PD-L1 cells in vivo, we injected rat
anti-PD-L1 mAb or normal rat IgG as a control at 0.1 mg per
mouse on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 after the inoculation of P815PD-L1
cells (3  106 cells per mouse). Injection with the anti-PD-L1
mAb significantly inhibited the local tumor growth, with 40% of
the recipients being completely cured of the tumor. On the other
hand, 100% of the mice that received control IgG showed
progressive tumor growth and were killed within 6 wk (Fig. 3B).
Survey of various tumor cell lines indicated that a significant
proportion of murine tumor lines, most notably all of the
independent myeloma lines so far examined, expressed PD-L1
(Fig. 4A). Therefore, we examined whether the PD-L1 naturally
expressed on tumor cells indeed contributed to their tumorige-
nicity in vivo. As shown in Fig. 4B, J558L myeloma cells
inoculated s.c. at 2.5  106 cells per mouse formed very rapidly
growing tumors in the syngeneic BALBc mice and killed them
within 3 wk. Injection with the anti-PD-L1 Ab after tumor
inoculation resulted in the significant suppression of the my-
eloma cell growth, although the tumors started to expand with
delay of 1 wk or so in the most of mice (Fig. 4B). A few reasons
may be considered for the only transient therapeutic effect of the
anti-PD-L1 mAb on the myeloma cells as compared to that on
P815PD-L1 tumor cells, such as less T cell immunogenicity,
more aggressive proliferative capacity, and possible selection for
variant clones with reduced PD-L1 expression in vivo in the
myeloma cells. It also should be noted that the presently
available anti-PD-L1 Ab is rat origin.
To evaluate the potential effects of complete blockade of
PD-1–PD-L1 interaction in vivo, we then examined the growth
of J558L in PD-1 mice of BALBc background. As indi-
cated in Fig. 4C Left, the growth of J558L myeloma was
completely suppressed in PD-1 BALBc mice, whereas the
tumors grew rapidly in the PD-1 littermates. To exclude the
possibility that PD-1 mice were generally resistant to any
immunogenic tumors because of the lack of inhibitory signals in
the cross-priming reactions, we compared the growth of B16
tumor cells, which did not express PD-L1 at all (Fig. 4A), in the
PD-1 and  mice of B6 background. As shown in Fig. 4C
Right, B16 cells formed largely comparable tumors in the PD-
1 and  mice. The results suggested that a sharp
distinction in the tumorigenesis of J558L cells in the syngeneic
PD-1 and  mice could be attributed primarily to the
expression of PD-L1 in the tumor cells. Thus, it was suggested
strongly that more persistent and efficient procedures to block
PD-1 or PD-L1 in vivo, soluble PD-L1 for instance, might

provide much improved therapeutic effect, and the trials are
currently ongoing.
It was reported that CTLA-4 blockade in vivo led to suppres-
sion or even rejection of a number of potentially lethal trans-
planted tumors, in which the effectiveness apparently correlated
with the inherent immunogenicity of the tumors (23). These
results indicate that weak immune responses against the tumors
can be converted into more potent ones effective for tumor
suppression and rejection by inhibiting the effects of negative
immunoreceptors. Because tumor cells per se rarely express the
ligands for CTLA-4, CTLA-4 is suggested to restrict the activa-
tion and expansion of the potential effector cells by cross-
presentation of the tumor antigens via host B7 antigen-
presenting cells (24). Present results, on the other hand, indicate
that PD-L1 expressed on tumor cells protects them from direct
immune attack by the specific CTL at the effector level at least
in vitro, and enhances the tumorigenicity in vivo. Although the
results imply the tumor-protective effect of PD-L1 at the level of
immune effector cells such as CTL in vivo, an additional possi-
bility remains open that the PD-L1 inhibits the T cell priming by
cross-presentation of tumor antigens as well, because PD-L1 also
is expressed on antigen-presenting cells (5). In any event, present
results suggest strongly that effective blockade of PD-1–PD-L
interaction in vivo should provide a promising strategy of
immunotherapy for selected tumors expressing PD-L. It would
also be interesting to examine whether there are any synergistic
therapeutic effects between blockade of PD-1 and CTLA-4 on
the tumors in vivo.
