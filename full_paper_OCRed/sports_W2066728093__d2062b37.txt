Summary
The innate immune system is essential for the initial detection of invading viruses and subsequent 
activation of adaptive immunity. Three classes of receptors, designated retinoic acid-inducible 
gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and NOD-like receptors (NLRs), 
sense viral components, such as double-stranded (ds) RNA, single-stranded RNA and DNA. RLRs 
and TLRs play essential roles in the production of type I interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory 
cytokines in cell type-specific manners. While the RLRs play essential roles in the recognition of 
RNA viruses in various cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells utilize TLRs for detecting virus 
invasion. On the other hand, NLRs play a role in the production of mature interleukin-1β to 
dsRNA stimulation. Activation of innate immune cells is critical for mounting adaptive immune 
responses. In this review, we will discuss recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms 
of viral RNA recognition by these different types of receptors, and its relation to acquired immune 
responses.

Introduction
Host cells recognize the invasion of viruses and mount strong antiviral responses. Viruses 
initially activate the innate immune system, which recognizes viral components through 
pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) (1-3). On the other hand, acquired immunity plays a 
major role in the responses to re-infection with viruses. Host PRRs detect viral components, 
such as genomic DNA, single-stranded (ss) RNA, double-stranded (ds) RNA, RNA with 5′-
triphosphate ends and viral proteins. Currently, three classes of PRRs have been shown to be 
involved in the recognition of virus-specific components in innate immune cells, namely 
Toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) and 
NOD-like receptors (NLRs). Among these receptor types, TLRs and RLRs are important for 
the production of type I interferons (IFNs) and various cytokines, whereas NLRs are known 
to regulate interleukin-1β (IL-1β) maturation through activation of caspase-1 (4, 5).

Detection of viral components by RLRs and TLRs in immune cells activates intracellular 
signaling cascades, leading to the secretion of type I IFNs, proinflammatory cytokines and 
chemokines, and increased expression of co-stimulatory molecules such as CD40, CD80 and 
CD86. Type I IFNs activate intracellular signaling pathways via a type I IFN receptor, and 
regulate the expression of a set of genes. The IFN-inducible genes, such as protein kinase R 
and 2′5′-oligoadenylate synthase, are involved in eliminating viral components from 
infected cells, inducing apoptosis of infected cells and conferring resistance to viral infection 
on uninfected cells. Type I IFNs are produced not only by professional innate immune cells, 
including dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, but also by non-professional cells, such as 
fibroblasts. Proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines are also critical for eliminating virus 
infection by provoking inflammation and recruiting innate and acquired immune cells. Co-
stimulatory molecules are essential for the activation of T cells, leading to acquired immune 
reactions.
In this review, we focus on the roles of these PRRs in the recognition of viruses and 
initiation of antiviral immune responses, as well as their mechanisms for recognizing viral 
components.
The RLR family
RLRs comprise a family of cytoplasmic proteins consisting of three members, RIG-I (also 
known as DDX58), melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5; also known as 
helicard or IFIH1) and LGP2 (6-8) (9, 10). RIG-I and MDA5 consist of two N-terminal 
caspase-recruitment domains (CARDs), a DExD/H box RNA helicase domain and a C-
terminal repressor domain (RD), whereas LGP2 lacks a CARD. The helicase domains of the 
RLR family members are highly similar to that of mammalian Dicer, a dsRNA-specific 
nuclease required for micro RNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA) biogenesis. 
Although a report showed that presence of the helicase domain suppressed Dicer RNase 
activity, the role of the Dicer helicase domain in its function in miRNA maturation is not 
well understood (11).
The RLRs recognize viral RNAs in the cytoplasm. RNA virus infection leads to the 
generation of dsRNA and RNAs with 5′-triphosphate ends in infected cells. Long dsRNA is 
not normally present in cells, and the 5′ ends of host RNAs are typically capped. The 
helicase domain and RD are important for the recognition of these RNAs, while the CARDs 
are essential for triggering intracellular signaling cascades (6, 12). LGP2 lacks a CARD, and 
is suggested to function as a negative regulator of RIG-I/MDA5 signaling. Overexpression 
of LGP2 inhibits Sendai virus (SeV) and Newcastle disease virus signaling. Lgp2-/- mice 
show highly elevated induction of type I IFNs in response to polyinosinic polycytidylic acid 
(poly I:C) stimulation, and modestly increased IFN production in response to vesicular 
stomatitis virus (VSV) infection (9, 10). On the other hand, Lgp2-/- mice show partially 
impaired type I IFN production in response to EMCV infection (13). In this study, it was 
shown that LGP2 was a negative regulator of RIG-I, but not of MDA5. However, given that 
both poly I:C and EMCV are recognized by MDA5, the difference cannot be fully explained 
by differential usage of LGP2 for RIG-I and MDA5 signaling.

Recognition of RNA viruses by RLRs
Studies using RLR-deficient mice have revealed that these proteins are essential for the 
production of type I IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines in response to RNA virus 
infection. Cell lacking RIG-I do not produce type I IFNs in response to various RNA 
viruses, including paramyxoviruses, VSV and influenza virus (Figure 1) (14-16). In contrast, 
MDA5-deficient mice do not respond to infection with picornaviruses, such as 
encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and Theiler's virus (15, 17). Consistent with the defect 
in type I IFN production, RIG-I-/- and MDA5-/- mice are highly susceptible to inoculation 
with VSV and EMCV, respectively. Japanese encephalitis virus and hepatitis C virus (HCV), 
which belong to the Flaviviridae family, are both recognized by RIG-I (15, 18). Huh7 cells 
harboring a RIG-I mutant were found to be permissive to HCV infection (18). GB virus, a 
mouse model of human HCV, is also recognized by RIG-I (19). However, Dengue virus and 
West Nile virus, which also belong to the Flaviviridae family, were shown to induce type I 
IFN production, even in the absence of RIG-I or MDA5 (20, 21). siRNA experiments 
suggested that Dengue virus is recognized by the combination of RIG-I and MDA5. Vaccine 
strains of measles virus were found to activate cells in a RIG-I/MDA5-dependent manner, 
whereas wild-type measles virus failed to induce type I IFN production (22). However, 
poliovirus is expected to be recognized by MDA5 because it is a member of the 
Picornaviridae family. Interestingly, MDA5 was reported to be cleaved by a poliovirus 
protease in infected cells. Thus, poliovirus may subvert the MDA5-mediated recognition 
system to establish its infection (23). Infection with dsRNA virus, Reovirus, induced IFN-β 
production mainly through MDA5, however, absence of both RIG-I and MDA5 completely 
abrogated IFN production, suggesting that both RIG-I and MDA5 are involved in the 
recognition of Reovirus (24). It was reported that a DNA virus, EBV, produced small RNAs 
which induced RIG-I-mediated IFN-β production. However, since the study utilized 
artificial RNA synthesized by T7 polymerase which can activate RIG-I irrespective of the 
sequence, it is not clear if small RNA encoded by EBV truly activate RIG-I in the cells (25, 
26).
In summary, RNA viruses are recognized by either RIG-I, MDA5 or combination of RIG-I 
and MDA5 for inducing type I IFNs in various cells. Given that type I IFN production to 
various RNA viruses was totally abrogated in cells lacking RIG-I and MDA5, it is assumed 
that there is no other receptor recognizing RNA viruses to induce type I IFNs present.
Recognition of RNAs by RIG-I and MDA5
dsRNA is present in cells infected with dsRNA viruses as well as being generated during the 
course of ssRNA virus replication. Since host cells do not produce dsRNA, the innate 
immune system discriminates between host and viral RNAs by the presence of dsRNA. 
Initially, both RIG-I and MDA5 were implicated in the recognition of poly I:C, a synthetic 
analogue of viral dsRNA (6, 9, 10). However, analyses of RIG-I-/- and MDA5-/- mice 
revealed that MDA5, but not RIG-I, is responsible for the IFN response to poly I:C 
stimulation (15). Reciprocally, RIG-I, but not MDA5, is essential for IFN production in 
response to ssRNA with 5′-triphosphate ends (27, 28). RNAs from some viruses are known 
to be 5′-triphosphorylated and uncapped, whereas the 5′ ends of host mRNAs are capped.

A previous report showed that 5′ triphosphate ssRNAs of >19 nt in length efficiently 
induced IFN-α production in a RIG-I-dependent fashion, and that the RNA sequence did not 
affect the ability of RNAs to induce IFNs (27). However, a recent report showed that a poly 
U-containing RNA sequence corresponding to the 3′ non-translated region of Hepatitis C 
virus (HCV) genomic RNA preferentially activated RIG-I compared to other sequences of 
HCV (29). Given the RNAs in the study was synthesized by the T7 polymerase, it is not 
clear if the phenomenon recapitulates HCV infection in vivo. Further studies will clarify the 
roles of RNA sequences in RIG-I-mediated responses to 5′ triphosphate RNAs.
The next issues are whether RIG-I recognizes dsRNAs without 5′-triphosphate ends and the 
identification of the molecular structures of MDA5 ligands. Poly I:C is an artificial dsRNA 
generated by annealing between poly I and poly C. Poly I and poly C are synthesized by 
polynucleotide phosphorylase, which catalyzes the polymerization of nucleotide diphosphate 
(30). Thus, poly I:C does not harbor a 5′ triphosphate end. By electrophoresis, we found 
that untreated poly I:C migrated as a smeared band corresponding to the mobilities of 4-8-
kbp dsDNA fragments (24). Partial digestion of poly I:C with a dsRNA-specific 
endonuclease, RNase III, led to the generation of short trimmed poly I:C of about 300 bp. 
By treating RIG-I-/- and MDA5-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts with untreated and shortened 
poly I:C, we found that poly I:C was converted from a MDA5 ligand into a RIG-I ligand in a 
dsRNA length-dependent manner. In addition, chemically synthesized monophosphate end 
dsRNA of 70 bp induced production of type I IFNs in a RIG-I-dependent manner. Notably, 
complete digestion of poly I:C produced 10-20-bp dsRNAs that failed to stimulate even 
wild-type cells, consistent with a previous observation. In addition, long and short poly I:Cs 
preferentially bind to MDA5 and RIG-I proteins, respectively, leading to the activation of 
ATPase activity. It seems that dsRNAs of up to 1 kb are completely recognized by RIG-I, but 
not by MDA5. On the other hand, dsRNAs of >2 kb can be recognized by MDA5. These 
observations indicate that RIG-I and MDA5 proteins directly discriminate the lengths of 
dsRNA.
Not only synthesized dsRNAs, but also viral dsRNAs differentially activate RIG-I and 
MDA5 depending on their length (24). The genome of Reovirus, a dsRNA virus, consists of 
10 segments in three distinct classes called L, M and S corresponding to their sizes of 3.9, 
2.2-2.3 and 1.2-1.4 kbp, respectively. While the introduction of S segments into cells 
induced IFN-β in a RIG-I-dependent manner, both RIG-I and MDA5 contributed to the 
recognition of L segments.
EMCV produces high levels of dsRNA in infected cells, whereas dsRNA was barely 
detected in influenza virus-infected cells (28, 31). Genomic RNA from influenza virus 
harbors a 5′ triphosphate end, whereas the 5′ end of EMCV genomic RNA is covalently 
linked to a small protein, VPg (32). Thus, it was thought that the presence of dsRNA or 5′ 
triphosphate RNA was responsible for the recognition of viruses by MDA5 or RIG-I. 
However, VSV, a ssRNA virus recognized by RIG-I, was found to produce dsRNA in 
infected cells (24). Disruption of dsRNA among RNAs from VSV-infected cells reduced 
IFN-β-inducing activity, suggesting that the presence of dsRNA in VSV-infected cells is 
important for recognition by RIG-I. Interestingly, the dsRNA fragments produced by VSV 
infection were about 2.0-2.5 kbp, and much shorter than those produced by EMCV

infection. Given that the length of the VSV genomic RNA is 11 kb, the dsRNA fragments 
were not replication intermediates of VSV. It has been reported that defective interfering 
(DI) particles are generated in VSV-infected cells, and that the sizes of DI particle snap-back 
dsRNAs are about 2.2 kb (33). Thus, dsRNA generated during the course of VSV replication 
may be derived from DI particles, although further studies are needed to clarify the source of 
the dsRNA. Since DI particles are known to strongly induce type I IFNs, RIG-I may have a 
role in detecting the presence of dsRNA in DI particles. Collectively, these findings 
demonstrate that RIG-I recognizes 5′ triphosphate RNA and dsRNA during the course of 
RNA virus infection, and that the length of the dsRNA generated during the course of the 
infection is important for differential recognition by RIG-I and MDA5.
Both the helicase domain and RD of RLRs potentially associate with viral RNA. Structural 
analyses of the RIG-I RD by X-ray crystallography and NMR revealed that 5′ triphosphate 
ssRNA and dsRNA directly bind to the basic surface of the RIG-I RD (34, 35). Interestingly, 
the RIG-I RD resembles a zinc-binding domain that is structurally related to the GDP/GTP 
exchange factors of Rab-like GTPases. Although the RIG-I helicase domain has an activity 
to unwind dsRNA with 3′ overhands, in vitro studies suggest that the helicase activity of 
RIG-I is not correlated with its function to induce type I IFNs (35). On the other hand, a 
point mutation in Walker's ATP-binding motif in the RIG-I helicase domain abolished the 
IFN-β-inducing ability. Therefore, it is assumed that the RIG-I helicase domain is required 
not for actually unwinding dsRNAs, but for changing the conformation of RIG-I to facilitate 
signaling through the CARDs.
Modulation of RIG-I-mediated recognition
RIG-I-mediated signaling is positively and negatively controlled by ubiquitination of RIG-I. 
First, the CARDs of RIG-I undergo Lys 63-linked ubiquitination by tripartite motif (TRIM) 
25, a ubiquitin E3 ligase composed of a RING finger domain, B box/coiled-coil domain and 
SPRY domain (36). This ubiquitination is necessary for efficient activation of the RIG-I 
signaling pathway, and TRIM25-/- cells display impaired production of type I IFNs in 
response to viral infection. RIG-I also undergoes ubiquitination by the ubiquitin ligase 
RNF125, which leads to its proteasomal degradation (37). Thus, RIG-1 ubiquitination by 
RNF125 is considered to inhibit aberrant activation of RIG-I signaling.
RNase L, an endonuclease originally thought to cleave viral ssRNA, was reported to be 
involved in the production of IFN-β in response to RNA virus infection or dsRNA 
stimulation (38). Furthermore, 2′,5′-linked oligoadenylate generated by virus infection was 
found to activate RNase L for cleavage of self-RNA, resulting in the generation of small 
RNA products that are responsible for RIG-I/MDA5-mediated recognition and subsequent 
production of type I IFNs. However, the precise structures of these small RNAs generated by 
RNase L require further investigation.
The RLR signaling pathway
In response to detection of viral RNAs, RIG-I and MDA5 associate with an adaptor protein, 
designated IFN-β promoter stimulator-1 (IPS-1; also known as MAVS, VISA or CARDIF;

Figure 2) (39-42). IPS-1 contains a CARD in its N-terminus, and crystal structurure analyses 
revealed that this CARD adopts the classic CARD fold with an asymmetric surface charge 
distribution, and shares homology with the first CARDs of RIG-I and MDA5 for homotypic 
CARD-CARD interaction (43). IPS-1-/- MEFs and cDCS are defective in producing type I 
IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines in response to all RNA viruses recognized by RIG-I or 
MDA5, and IPS-1-/- mice were susceptible to infection with various RNA viruses (44, 45). 
These findings indicate that IPS-1 plays essential roles in RIG-I/MDA5 signaling. This 
protein is present in the outer mitochondrial membrane, suggesting that mitochondria may 
be important for IFN responses, in addition to their roles in metabolism and cell death. IPS-1 
is known to be cleaved by the HCV protease NS3/4A in HCV-infected cells (41, 46). 
NLRX1 (also known as NOD9) was reported to associate with IPS-1 (47). NLRX1 is 
comprised of a nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), and is localized 
on the mitochondrial outer membrane. Overexpression of NLRX1 inhibits virus-induced 
IFN-β promoter activation by disrupting RIG-I/MDA5-IPS-1 interactions. Reciprocally, 
knockdown of NLRX1 leads to augmentation of virus-induced type I IFN production. Thus, 
NLRX1 is suggested to function as a modifier of IPS-1.
The RLR and tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFRI) signaling pathways share molecules 
for activating transduction. TNFR-associated death domain (TRADD) protein, an essential 
adaptor for TNFR signaling, is recruited to IPS-1 upon stimulation, and is also important for 
RLR signaling (48). TRADD forms a complex with FAS-associated death domain-
containing protein (FADD) and a death domain kinase, receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1), 
in addition to TNF-receptor associated factor (TRAF) 3, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that 
assembles a lysine 63-linked polyubiquitin chain. TRAF3 is essential for RLR-mediated 
type I IFN responses, and its function is regulated by the deubiquitinase DUBA (49-51).
Downstream of TRAF3, two IKK-related kinases, TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and 
inducible IκB kinase (IKKi; also known as IKKε), which phosphorylate IFN-regulatory 
factor (IRF)-3 and IRF-7, are activated (52-54). Phosphorylation of IRF-3/-7 by these 
kinases induces the formation of homodimers and/or heterodimers. Next, the IRF-3/-7 
homodimers and/or heterodimers translocate into the nucleus and bind to ISREs, resulting in 
the expression of type I IFNs and a set of IFN-inducible genes (55, 56). Cells lacking both 
IRF-3 and IRF-7 did not produce type I IFNs in response to viral infection.
TBK1 and IKK-i interact with TRAF family member-associated NF-κB activator (TANK), 
NAK-associated protein 1 (NAP1) and similar to NAP1 TBK1 adaptor (SINTBAD) (57-59). 
These molecules contain a TBK1-binding motif, and show similarities among their coiled-
coil domains. Although knockdown of either TANK, NAP1 or SINTBAD impairs RLH 
signaling, the relationship between these molecules in RLH signaling is not yet fully 
understood.
The RLR signaling pathway activates another transcription factor, NF-κB, for the expression 
of proinflammatory genes. IPS-1, TRADD and FADD are important for activating both IRFs 
and NF-κB (60). FADD then interacts with caspase-8/-10 and the catalytic activities of these 
caspases are critical for the subsequent nuclear translocation of NF-κB.

A recent study identified a novel protein named stimulator of IFN genes (STING) as an 
important molecule for RIG-I/MDA5 signaling (61). Overexpression of STING activated 
NF-κB and ISRE via TBK1/IKKi. STING-deficient mice showed impaired production of 
IFN-β to VSV infection. Interestingly, STING is a protein with 5 transmembrane regions 
localizing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, and interacts with SSR2/TRAPβ, a 
member of translocon-associated protein (TRAP) complex. This protein complex is required 
for protein translocation across the ER membrane. Given IPS-1 localizes on mitochondrial 
membrane, how the RIG-I signaling transduces through different organelles is interesting 
topics for future studies.
Recognition of viral components by the TLR system
In addition to the RLRs, TLRs are important for recognizing virus infection. TLRs are 
comprised of LRRs, a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain designated the 
Toll/IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) homology (TIR) domain (1). TLRs are transmembrane proteins 
suitable for detecting viral components outside of cells as well as in cytoplasmic vacuoles 
after phagocytosis or endocytosis. Among the >10 TLRs present in mammals, TLR2, TLR3, 
TLR4, TLR7 and TLR9 are involved in the recognition of viral components. TLR2 and 
TLR4, present on plasma membrane, are involved in the recognition of viral envelope 
proteins on the cell surface, while TLR2 and TLR4 are critical for the recognition of 
bacterial components, lipoproteins and lipopolysaccharide, respectively. In contrast, TLR3, 
TLR7 and TLR9 are localized on cytoplasmic vesicles, such as endosomes and the 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and recognize microbial nucleotides. TLR3 recognizes dsRNA, 
while TLR7 and TLR9 recognize ssRNA and DNA with CpG motifs, respectively. While 
TLR3 recognizes dsRNA in conventional DCs and possibly epithelial cells, TLR7 and TLR9 
are highly expressed in plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), a cell type known to produce extremely 
high levels of type I IFNs in response to virus infection. Crystal structure analyses of TLR3 
clarified that the ectodomain of TLR3 containing the LRRs is dimerized in the presence of 
40-50-bp dsRNA (62-64). The ectodomains of TLRs exhibit a horseshoe shape, and dsRNAs 
bind to the N- and C-terminal portions of the TLR3 ectodomain. Ligand association with the 
TLR ectodomains stabilizes dimer formation, thereby leading to dimerization of the TIR 
domains and the initiation of signal transduction.
TLR signaling
All TLRs except TLR3 activate a common signaling pathway leading to the production of 
proinflammatory cytokines via MyD88, a protein comprised of a N-terminal death domain 
(DD) and a C-terminal TIR domain. Upon ligand stimulation, MyD88 interacts with IL-1R-
associated kinase (IRAK)-4. Human or mouse has 4 IRAK family members, called IRAK-1, 
IRAK-2, IRAK-M and IRAK-4. The IRAKs are characterized by an N-terminal DD and a 
C-terminal serine/threonine kinase domain. Recent studies revealed that IRAK-4 is an 
upstream kinase that phosphorylates IRAK-1 and IRAK-2 (65-67). IRAK-1 rapidly interacts 
with IRAK-4 and is phosphorylated after TLR activation, and then IRAK-1 undergoes 
degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In contrast, IRAK-2 interacts with 
IRAK-4 later than IRAK-1, and stayed phosphorylated for a long time. IRAK-2-/- 
macrophages failed to sustain cytokine gene expression in response to TLR stimulation, and

cells lacking both IRAK-1 and IRAK-2 show abrogated TLR-mediated cytokine production 
as well as severe impairment in NF-κB activation(67). These results indicate that IRAK-1 
and IRAK-2 are sequentially activated by IRAK-4, and are essential for the TLR signaling. 
On the other hand, IRAK-M is reported to be a negative regulator of the TLR signaling (68).
Downstream of IRAKs, TRAF6 is activated and catalyzes the formation of a K63-linked 
polyubiquitin chain on TRAF6 and on IKK-γ/NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO), together 
with an ubiquitination E2 enzyme complex consisting of UBC13 and UEV1A (69). TRAF6 
also activates TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), which phosphorylates IKK-β and MAP 
kinase kinase 6, which modulates the activation of NF-κB and MAP kinases that results in 
induction of genes involved in inflammatory responses. Deletion of TAK1 and UBC13 in 
mice revealed that these molecules play a critical role in TLR-mediated cytokine production, 
in addition to their role in embryonic development (70, 71). TAK1 is essential for both NF-
κB and MAP kinases, whereas UBC13 was dispensable for NF-κB activation.
In response to stimulation with dsRNA, TLR3 recruits another adaptor protein, TIR domain-
containing adaptor inducing IFN-β (TRIF; also known as TICAM-1; Figure 2) (72-74). 
TRIF associates with TRAF3 and TRAF6 through TRAF-binding motifs present in its N-
terminal portion, and TRIF contains a C-terminal receptor-interacting protein (RIP) 
homotypic interaction motif (RHIM), and interacts with RIP1 and RIP3 via the RHIM (75, 
76). Recent studies showed that TRADD is also involved in the TRIF-dependent signaling 
pathway (77, 78). The downstream signaling molecules for the expression of IFN-inducible 
genes are shared between the TLR3 and RLR signaling pathways. Simultaneously, TRAF6 
and RIP1 are responsible for activating NF-κB through IκB kinase-α and -β (IKKα/β), 
leading to the expression of proinflammatory cytokines.
TLR7 and TLR9 activate distinct signaling pathways in response to viral RNA or DNA in 
pDCs. TLR7 and TLR9 recruit MyD88, which forms a complex with IRAK-1, IRAK-4 and 
IRF-7 in this cell type(79, 80). IRAK-1 and IKKα have been identified as potential IRF-7 
kinases (81, 82). Phosphorylated IRF-7 translocates into the nucleus to activate the 
promoters of type I IFN and IFN-inducible genes. The MyD88-dependent pathway is also 
critical for NF-κB leading to the production of cytokines including IL-12 and IL-6.
The localizations of TLR proteins are critical for the recognition of their ligands. An ER 
membrane protein, UNC93B, was identified as an essential molecule for the translocation of 
TLR7 and TLR9 from the ER to endosomes (83, 84). In cells from 3d mice harboring a 
missense point mutation in UNC93B, signaling by TLR3, TLR7 and TLR9 was abrogated. 
In addition, an autosomal recessive mutation in UNC93B in humans results in impaired 
immune responses against herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 encephalitis (85). It will be 
interesting to further clarify the mechanisms underlying the UNC93B-mediated regulation 
of TLR trafficking. Another ER protein, protein associated with TLR4 (PRAT4A), also 
controls TLR9 trafficking from the ER to endosomes/lysosomes (86, 87). In lysosomes, a 
cysteine protease, cathepsin K and cathepsin B/L, was found to be important for TLR9 
signaling, although the mechanism is not yet fully understood (88, 89).

A previous report showed that autophagosome formation is required for TLR7-mediated 
VSV recognition in pDCs (90). It was hypothesized that viral RNAs were taken up into 
autophagosomes, which then fuse with lysosomes where TLR7 is localized. pDCs from 
mice with defective autophagosome formation show impaired type I IFN production in 
response to VSV infection.
Collectively, recognition of viral nucleotides by TLRs in endosomes/lysosomes is controlled 
by the localizations of TLRs as well as their ligands. This elaborate mechanism may be 
essential for preventing autoimmune diseases caused by aberrant initiation of TLR signaling. 
In this regard, understanding the entire mechanism of TLR trafficking will lead to the 
development of ways to manipulate the immune system.
Production of IL-1β in response to RNA virus infection
Among the proinflammatory cytokines, IL-1β production is regulated not only by its mRNA 
synthesis but also by cleavage of pro-IL-1β via caspase-1(4, 5). Recent studies have revealed 
that the processing of pro-IL-1β is mediated by a large protein complex containing 
caspase-1, known as the inflammasome. The activation of caspase-1 is triggered by 
cytoplasmic NOD-LRR receptors, NALP3 (also known as cryopyrin or CIAS1) and ICE-
protease-activating factor (IPAF). These receptors together with an adaptor, ASC (apoptosis-
associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain), are components of 
the inflammasome (Figure 2). NALP3 is responsible for sensing presence of ATP as well as 
various crystals, such as monosodium urate, silica, asbestos and aluminum salts, by 
phagocytosis(91-94). Although mechanisms of crystal recognition by NALP3 is not fully 
understood, recent studies suggest that NALP3 activation is triggered by reaction oxygen 
species produced by a NADPH oxidase, or by lysosomal destabilization which may release 
protease Cathepsin B to the cytosol(93, 95). IPAF is known to be activated by infections 
with bacteria, such as Salmonella, Pseudomonas and Legionella, possibly by recognizing 
flagellin in the infected cells(96-98). dsRNA and poly I:C were reported to activate the 
inflammasome via a NALP3 -dependent pathway, but it remains unclear whether NALP3 
directly recognizes dsRNA in the cytoplasm(99). NALP3 is also critical for IL-1β 
processing in response to adenovirus infection. Although adenoviruses are DNA viruses, 
introduction of dsDNA into cells was found to activate IL-1β in a NALP3-independent 
manner, suggesting that adenovirus-induced IL-1β production is not induced by recognition 
of genomic DNA (100). However, ASC and caspase-1 are essential for dsDNA-induced 
IL-1β production, suggesting that one of the unknown NALP family members functions as a 
cytoplasmic DNA sensor.
Type I IFN-producing cells in response to viral infection
pDCs are known to produce vast amounts of type I IFNs to virus infection, and the 
importance of pDCs as the IFN-inducer has been emphasized. Nevertheless, cells other than 
pDCs are potent to produce type I IFNs as described above. Although RLRs play essential 
roles in the production of type I IFNs and cytokines in various cell types, such as fibroblasts 
and cDCs, pDCs produce these cytokines in the absence of RLH signaling(14). To identify 
IFN-producing cells in vivo, a reporter mouse strain expressing green fluorescent protein

(GFP) under the control of the IFN-α6 gene (Ifna6GFP/+) has been generated(101). In 
response to systemic NDV infection, pDCs were highly potent in expressing GFP, although 
cDCs and macrophages also produced IFN-α6. However, lung local infection of Ifna6GFP/+ 
mice with NDV resulted in increased numbers of GFP+ alveolar macrophages and cDCs, but 
not pDCs. pDCs started to produce IFN-α when alveolar macrophages were depleted or 
IPS-1-deficient mice were infected. NDV is non-pathogenic to wild-type mice, and NDV is 
almost cleared by 96 h post infection. On the other hand, alveolar macrophage-depleted 
mice and IPS-1-/- mice showed increased viral burden, suggesting that failure of the first 
line of defense led to production of type I IFNs from pDCs. In addition, lung infection with 
pathogenic Sendai virus also induced production of type I IFNs from pDCs. Thus, RLR-
mediated IFN responses function as the first line of defense against respiratory infection, and 
pDCs started to be activated when the defense is broken.
Roles of RLRs and TLRs in the activation of adaptive immune responses to 
viruses
Innate immediate immune responses are important for mounting acquired immune responses 
to viral infections. However, it is not clear how the innate PRRs are involved in the 
activation of acquired immunity. Recently, two different virus infection models have been 
analyzed to examine the roles of RLRs and TLRs in the activation of acquired immune 
responses. The first model virus is lymphocytoid choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), an 
ambisense ssRNA virus belonging to the Arenaviridae family, which is known to induce a 
cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response in a type I IFN-dependent manner(102). Analyses 
of MyD88-/- and IPS-1-/- mice revealed that the serum levels of type I IFNs and pro-
inflammatory cytokines are mainly dependent on the presence of MyD88, but not IPS-1. 
Furthermore, the generation of virus-specific CTLs is critically dependent on MyD88, but 
not IPS-1. Analysis of Ifna6+/GFP reporter mice revealed that pDCs are the major source of 
IFN-α in LCMV infection. These results suggest that recognition of LCMV by pDCs via 
TLRs is responsible for the production of type I IFNs in vivo. Furthermore, TLRs, but not 
RLRs, appear to be important for mounting CTL responses to LCMV infection.
Influenza virus has also been used to study the activation of adaptive immune responses. 
Induction of type I IFNs in response to intranasal influenza A virus infection was found to 
be abrogated in the absence of both MyD88 and IPS-1, although mice lacking either of these 
molecules were capable of producing IFNs(103). Induction of B cells or CD4 T cells 
specific to viral proteins was dependent on the presence of MyD88, but not IPS-1, whereas 
induction of nuclear protein Ag-specific CD8 T cells was not impaired in the absence of 
either MyD88 or IPS-1. These results suggest that the adaptive immune responses to 
influenza A virus are governed by TLRs. Another study examined the contribution of IPS-1 
and MyD88 to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in mice(104). RSV infection 
induced type I IFNs and inflammatory cytokines in an IPS-1-dependent and MyD88-
independent manner. Nevertheless, both IPS-1 and MyD88 were important for the clearance 
of RSV as well as production of RSV-specific antibodies. However, mice lacking both IPS-1 
and MyD88 were still capable of mounting CD8+ CTL responses to RSV infection,

suggesting that RLR- and TLR-independent RNA virus recognition might be responsible for 
the activation of CD8+ T cells in the lung.
As described above, poly I:C is recognized by MDA5 and TLR3. The contributions of these 
two systems to the activation of T cell responses have been examined using mice deficient in 
IPS-1 or TRIF, adaptor molecules responsible for the signaling of MDA5 and TRIF, 
respectively. Enhancement of Ag-specific antibody responses as well as CD8 T cell 
expansion in response to poly I:C stimulation is impaired in IPS-1-deficient mice(105). 
Although the responses of TRIF-deficient mice are modestly impaired, IPS-1/TRIF doubly 
deficient mice are almost unresponsive to poly I:C treatment, suggesting that both MDA5 
and IPS-1 contribute to mounting acquired immune responses to poly I:C stimulation.
The virus infection models tested to date support roles for TLRs, rather than RLHs, in 
instructing the adaptive immune system. However, further studies are required since these 
two PRR systems contribute differently depending on the viruses involved, and their 
contributions may also depend on the route of infection. Though production of type I IFNs 
and proinflammatory cytokines depends on the presence of TLR- and RLR-dependent 
signaling, activation of CD8+ T cell responses does not depend on either singling pathway. 
It is intriguing to explore how CTL responses are activated in response to the virus infection.
Conclusions
The innate PRRs differentially recognize viral components in cell type-specific manners. As 
described in this review, RIG-I and MDA5 discriminate short and long dsRNAs, 
respectively. However, the molecular mechanisms for how RIG-I and MDA5 distinguish the 
lengths of dsRNA remain to be determined. Structural analyses of MDA5 will clarify the 
mechanism of MDA5-mediated recognition of long dsRNA. Another issue is the role of 
RIG-I helicase activity in the recognition of viral RNAs. Although several reports have 
shown that RIG-I protein can unwind short dsRNA, it is apparent that this “helicase” activity 
is not required for the recognition of 5′ triphosphate ssRNA. Given that the RIG-I helicase 
domain catalyzes ATP, it is assumed that the helicase domain is critical for the 
conformational change required to expose the CARDs and trigger intracellular signaling.
In pDCs, TLR9 is essential for type I IFN production in response to DNA virus infection by 
recognizing viral genomic DNA. However, the presence of dsDNA detectors in the 
cytoplasm has been predicted(106). TLR9 activates type I IFN responses by a signaling 
pathway through TBK1/IKK-i. Indeed, DNA viruses, HSV and mouse cytomegalovirus, 
produce type I IFNs independently of the TLR system in non-pDCs. Recognition of 
intracellular bacteria such as Listeria and Legionella is potentially through their dsDNA 
(107). In addition, loss of exonuclease 1 (Trex1) resulted in accumulation of single-stranded 
DNA derived from endogenous retroelements leading to the development of autoimmune 
diseases such as Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (AGS) via production of type I IFNs (108). 
Thus, accumulating evidence indicates that recognition of cytoplasmic DNA is critical for 
innate immune responses as well as prevention of autoimmune diseases. Although a protein 
named DAI/ZBP1 was proposed as a candidate for the dsDNA sensor(109), DAI/ZBP1-/- 
mouse cells do not show any defects in the induction of IFN-β and IFN-inducible

genes(110). The identification of the dsDNA detector will open the door toward 
understanding the immune responses to DNA virus infection. It has been shown that STING 
is essential for type I IFN production to cytoplasmic dsDNA stimulation and infection with 
Listeria and HSV1 (61). Although STING itself is unlikely to be a DNA receptor, further 
analysis of the function of this protein or identification of STING binding partners might be 
a clue for solving the DNA recognition pathways.
Antiviral immune responses in vivo are mediated not only by DCs, macrophages, T cells and 
B cells, but also by many other cell types, such as NK cells and NK T cells. Thus, it is 
important to understand dynamic interaction between the immune cells by monitoring 
immune cell behavior, interaction and activation in vivo. The understanding of mechanisms 
for the activation of antiviral immunity will leads to development of novel immunotherapy 
and vaccines for infectious diseases, immune diseases and cancer.

Figure 1. 
Differential roles of RIG-I and MDA5 in RNA virus recognition.
RIG-I recognizes 5′-triphosphate RNA and short dsRNA, whereas MDA5 discriminates 
long dsRNA generated during the course of virus infection. RNA viruses are differentially 
recognized by RIG-I and MDA5. RIG-I is responsible for detecting Paramyxoviridae, 
Orthomyxoviridae, Rhabdoviridae and some Flaviviridae family members. On the other 
hand, MDA5 recognizes Picornaviridae family members. Some viruses such as West Nile 
virus and Reovirus are detected by both RIG-I and MDA5. LGP2 is reported to be a genitive 
regulator for the RIG-I and MDA5 signaling.

Figure 2. 
Three classes of PRRs for RNA virus recognition.
ssRNA from viruses is recognized by TLR7 in pDCs, whereas dsRNA is detected by TLR3 
in cDCs. TLR7 and TLR3 trigger signaling cascades via the adaptors MyD88 and TRIF, 
respectively. RIG-I and MDA5 recruit another adaptor protein, IPS-1. TRIF and IPS-1 share 
signaling molecules for phosphorylation of IRF-3 and IRF-7 by TBK1/IKK/i. MyD88-
dependent signaling directly activates IRF-7 in pDCs. Phosphorylated IRF-3 and IRF-7 
activate the expression of type I IFN genes. Simultaneously, TLRs and RLRs induce the 
translocation of NF-κB to induce the expression of cytokine genes via distinct adaptor 
proteins. On the other hand, one of the NLR proteins, NALP3, detects the presence of 
dsRNA and induces the catalytic activity of caspase-1 via an adaptor, ASC. Caspase-1 is 
essential for cleavage of pro-IL-1β to the mature form.
