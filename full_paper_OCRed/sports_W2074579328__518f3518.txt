Serineythreonine kinase AktyPKB is a downstream effector mole-
cule of phosphoinositide 3-kinase and is thought to mediate many
biological actions toward anti-apoptotic responses. We found that
Akt formed a complex with a 90-kDa heat-shock protein (Hsp90) in
vivo. By constructing deletion mutants, we identiﬁed that amino
acid residues 229–309 of Akt were involved in the binding to Hsp90
and amino acid residues 327–340 of Hsp90b were involved in the
binding to Akt. Inhibition of Akt-Hsp90 binding led to the dephos-
phorylation and inactivation of Akt, which increased sensitivity of
the cells to apoptosis-inducing stimulus. The dephosphorylation of
Akt was caused by an increase in protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)-
mediated dephosphorylation and not by a decrease in 3-phospho-
inositide-dependent protein kinase-1-mediated phosphorylation.
These results indicate that Hsp90 plays an important role in
maintaining Akt kinase activity by preventing PP2A-mediated
dephosphorylation.

T
he characterization of survival signal transduction pathways
stimulated by growth factors has revealed that phosphoino-
sitide 3-kinase [PI(3)K] is involved in protecting cells from
apoptosis (1–3). After growth factor stimulation, PI(3)K is
activated and generates phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate
[PtdIns(3,4,5)P3], which raises a diverse set of cellular responses.
One target of PI(3)K is the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-
containing serineythreonine kinase Akt (4, 5). By stimulation
with growth factors and cytokines, Akt is recruited from the
cytosol to the plasma membrane and is phosphorylated at two
key regulatory sites, Thr308 and Ser473, by 3-phosphoinositide-
dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) (6–11). It has recently been
reported that activated Akt can phosphorylate Bad (12, 13),
caspase-9 (14), and FKHRL1 (15), leading to their inactivation
and to cell survival. Akt has also been shown to phosphorylate
IkB kinase and up-regulate its kinase activity, which results in
promotion of NF-kB-mediated inhibition of apoptosis (16, 17).
Cells encounter environmental stress through the coordinated
synthesis of heat-shock proteins (18). Many heat-shock proteins
are expressed at high levels, even in unstressed conditions, and
are involved in many cellular processes (19). The 90-kDa heat-
shock protein (Hsp90) is a highly conserved protein and is
essential for viability in yeast (20). Hsp90 plays an important role
in refolding certain denatured proteins under stress conditions.
Unlike the more general Hsp70 and Hsp60 chaperones, Hsp90
appears to have substrate-specific folding activity. Hsp90 has an
additional role in the conformational regulation of certain signal
transduction molecules (19).
To clarify the regulation of Akt kinase activity, we screened
the Akt binding proteins and found that Hsp90 could bind to Akt
in vivo. The blockade of the binding to Hsp90 inactivated Akt and
increased sensitivity of the cells to apoptosis-inducing stimuli.
We found that Hsp90 binding to Akt protected Akt from protein
phosphatase 2A (PP2A)-mediated dephosphorylation. Thus,
interaction with Hsp90 might play an important role in regulat-
ing Akt kinase activity.
Materials and Methods
Cell Culture Conditions. All of the cells were cultured in DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS. In some experiments, VP-16
(etoposide; kindly provided by Bristol–Meyers Squibb), Z-Asp-
CH2-DCB (Funakoshi, Tokyo), LY294002 (Sigma), or Okadaic
acid (Wako, Tokyo) were added to the culture medium.
Expression Vector Construction. Human full-length akt1 and mu-
rine bcl-2 cDNAs were generated by reverse transcription–PCR
(21–23). The human full-length hsp90a, hsp90b, and PDK1
cDNAs in a pcDNA3.1yGS vector were purchased from Invitro-
gen. Several akt and hsp90b fragments were generated by PCR.
Converting both Thr308 and Ser473 codons to Asp codons in
wild-type (WT)-akt generated an active form of akt cDNA,
D2-akt (T308DyS473D-akt). The kinase-dead form of akt cDNA
(KD–akt) was produced by converting Lys179 codon to Met
codon. These cDNAs were subcloned into a pFLAG-CMV-2
vector (Kodak), a pc5FLAG vector (21), or a pHM6 vector
(Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The active mouse akt1 cDNA
in a pUSEamp vector was purchased from Upstate Biotechnol-
ogy (Lake Placid, NY).
Transfection, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot Analysis. The
appropriate plasmids were transiently transfected by using Su-
perfect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). In some
experiments, cells were cultured in serum-free medium for 24 h
following incubation at 45°C for 20 min (heat shock). Then, cells
were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mM TriszHCl, pH 7.5y0.2%
Nonidet P-40y10% glyceroly1 mM EDTAy1.5 mM MgCl2y137
mM NaCly50 mM NaFy1 mM NaVO3y12 mM b-glycerophos-
phatey1 mM PMSFy1 mM aprotinin). The cell lysates were
incubated with the protein G agarose conjugated with a control
sheep IgG, a sheep anti-Akt polyclonal antibody (pAb), a sheep
anti-PDK1 pAb (Upstate Biotechnology), or an anti-(His)6 mAb
(CLONTECH), or with the agarose conjugated with an anti-
FLAG M2 mAb (anti-FLAG M2 agarose; Sigma).
Western blot analysis was performed, as described previously
(24). The pAbs used were to Hsp90 (StressGen Biotechnologies,
Victoria, Canada), Akt, phospho-Akt (Ser473) (New England
Biolabs), phospho-Akt (Thr308) (Upstate Biotechnology), phos-
pho-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (pTEpY), poly-
(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) p85 fragment (Promega),
and MAPK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The mAbs used were
to V5 tag (Invitrogen), FLAG tag M2 (Sigma), HA tag (Roche

Assay of Akt and PDK1 Kinase Activity. The Akt or PDK1 kinase
activity was estimated by using an Akt kinase assay kit or a PDK1
kinase assay kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Upstate Biotechnology).
In Vitro PDK1 and PP2A Treatment. The immunoprecipitated
FLAG-tagged Akt was incubated with recombinant human
active PDK1 (Upstate Biotechnology) in the presence or absence
of lipid vesicles containing PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 or with purified
human PP2A (Upstate Biotechnology) at 30°C for 30 min. In
some experiments, 1 mM Okadaic acid was added into the
reactions. The reactions were electrophoresed and were sub-
jected to Western blot analysis.
Estimation of Apoptosis. Staining with 49,6-diamidino-2-
phenylindole (DAPI) and the estimation of the caspase activity
in the cell lysates were carried out, as described previously (24).
Results
Binding of Akt to Hsp90 in Vivo. To find the molecules that interact
with Akt, we performed immunoblot analysis after immunopre-
cipitation of Akt with an anti-Akt pAb. As shown in Fig. 1A, we
found that endogenous Hsp90 interacted with endogenous Akt
in both mouse fibroblast BALBy3T3 and human embryonic
kidney 293T cells. The endogenous Hsp90 and the transfected
V5-tagged Hsp90b formed a complex with WT-Akt, D2-Akt,
KD-Akt, but not with Bcl-2 (Fig. 1 B and C). We could not detect
the Akt binding to Hsp70 or to 14-3-3 protein (data not shown).
Identification of the Domains Responsible for Akt–Hsp90 Interaction.
To identify the binding site in Akt, we prepared deletion mutants
of Akt, as indicated in Fig. 2A. The V5-tagged Hsp90b was
expressed in 293T cells with the FLAG-tagged WT- or deleted
Akt (Fig. 2 B–D). Hsp90b could interact with WT-, DN-, DC-,
and DNC-, 1–331, and 205–480 Akt (Fig. 2 B and C). Further
analysis revealed that the binding of 1–246, 1–267, and 1–288 Akt
to Hsp90b was diminished and was weaker than that of 1–309
Akt. No interaction was observed between 1–228 Akt and
Hsp90b (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that amino acid residues
229–309 of Akt were involved in binding to Hsp90b and amino
acid residues 289–309 of Akt were responsible for strong binding
to Hsp90b (Fig. 2A, dotted and hatched areas, respectively).
We then prepared deletion mutants of Hsp90b, as indicated in
Fig. 3A. We found that Mid-, 1–635, 1–340, 1–355, 1–368, and
1–456 Hsp90b formed a complex with Akt (Fig. 3 B and C). We
did the reciprocal immunoprecipitation-Western blot experi-
ments and found that WT-Akt was coimmunoprecipitated with
1–340 and 1–635 Hsp90b but not with 1–326 Hsp90b (data not
shown). These results indicate that amino acid residues 327–340
of Hsp90b are involved in binding to Akt (Fig. 3A, hatched
areas).
The
identified
binding
domain
of
Hsp90b
(L327EFRALLFIPRRAP340) was different from the corre-
sponding Hsp90a sequence (L335EFRALLFVPRRAP348) by a
single amino acid, Ile335 (Fig. 3D). Thus, we examined Akt
binding to Hsp90a and found that Hsp90a could also bind to
WT- and 1–309 Akt but not to 1–229 Akt (Fig. 3E).
Interference with Akt Binding to Hsp90b Down-Regulates Akt Kinase
Activity. When 293T cells were serum starved, Akt was dephos-
phorylated. Under this condition, Akt was detached from Hsp90
(Fig. 4A). WT-Akt binding to Hsp90b and phosphorylation of
WT-Akt were inhibited by overexpressing 1–288 and 1–309 Akt
but not 1–228 Akt (Fig. 4B). Under this condition, Hsp90b
bound to 1–288 or 1–309 Akt (data not shown). Inhibition of
Akt-Hsp90 binding by expressing 1–309 Akt decreased Akt
kinase activity to about 60% of the control (Fig. 4C). These
results indicate that binding to Hsp90b plays an important role
in maintaining Akt kinase activity.
As previously reported (25), heat shock initiated Akt kinase
activity and increased the amount of phospho-Akt in HT1080
cells (Fig. 4D). Under this condition, increased Akt binding to
Hsp90b was observed. The heat shock-induced Akt phosphor-
ylation and activation, but not Akt binding to Hsp90b, were
prevented by pretreatment with the PI(3)K inhibitor LY294002.
Therefore, phosphorylation of Akt at Thr308 was not required for
Akt-Hsp90b binding. Overexpression of 1–309 Akt but not 1–228

Akt suppressed the heat shock-induced Akt binding to Hsp90b
and Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 4E, and data not shown), indi-
cating that NH2-terminal PH domain is not involved in Akt
dephosphorylation. The heat shock-induced phosphorylation of
MAPK was not affected by overexpression of 1–309 Akt (Fig.
4E). These results indicate that Akt binding to Hsp90b is
essential for Akt phosphorylation.
Induction of Apoptosis by Inhibiting Akt Binding to Hsp90b. We next
examined whether cells underwent apoptosis after inhibiting
Akt-Hsp90b binding. Expression of 1–309 Akt alone induced
apoptosis, to some extent, with nuclear condensation and frag-
mentation (Fig. 5A, c). During incubation of the cells in serum-
free medium, many apoptotic cells were observed (Fig. 5A, d).
Apoptotic cells were not observed in mock-transfected 293T
cells (Fig. 5A, a), even when the cells were serum starved for 24 h
(Fig. 5A, b). Overexpression of 1–309 Akt stimulated the acti-
vation of caspase-3-like protease, and the activity was promoted
when cells were serum starved for 24 h (Fig. 5B). Almost no
activity of caspase-3-like proteases was detected in the lysates of
mock-transfected 293T cells.
To estimate the effect of Akt-Hsp90 binding further, we
treated cells with the chemotherapeutic drug VP-16 to induce
apoptosis (Fig. 5C). PARP was one of the substrates of caspase-3
and was cleaved to produce the 85-kDa fragment (26). PARP
was cleaved in 1–309 Akt-transfected 293T cells, but not in
mock-transfected cells, cultured for 24 h in serum-free medium.
Adding VP-16 promoted PARP cleavage. A caspase inhibitor
Z-Asp-CH2-DCB suppressed the cleavage. We estimated the

tated and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. (B) The HA-tagged
akt mutants, the V5-tagged WT-hsp90b, andyor the FLAG-tagged WT-akt
were cotransfected into 293T cells. The cells were serum-starved for 24 h, and

with the indicated antibodies. The cell lysates were also immunoblotted with
the indicated antibodies. (C) 293T cells were transfected with mock or the
FLAG-tagged WT-akt together with mock or the HA-tagged 1–309 akt. The
cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then harvested. The cell lysates were
incubated with protein G agarose conjugated with a control IgG (lane 1) or an
anti-Akt pAb (lanes 2 and 3). The Akt kinase activity of the immunoprecipi-
tated Akt was estimated, as described in Materials and Methods. The vertical
bars represent SD value of triplicate determinations. The immunoprecipitated
proteins and the cell lysates were immunoblotted with the indicated antibod-
ies. (D) HT1080 cells were transfected with the FLAG-tagged WT-akt together
with V5-tagged WT-hsp90b. The cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then
incubated at 37°C or 45°C for 20 min. In some experiments, cells were treated
with 50 mM LY294002 for 10 min before heat shock. The Akt kinase activity of
the immunoprecipitated FLAG-tagged Akt was estimated, as described in
Materials and Methods. The vertical bars represent SD value of triplicate
determinations. The cell lysates were also immunoblotted with the indicated
antibodies. (E) HT1080 cells were transfected with the FLAG-tagged WT-akt,

45°C (1) for 20 min. The immunoprecipitated FLAG-tagged WT-Akt and the
cell lysates were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. The expres-
sion of the HA-tagged 1–309 Akt was conﬁrmed by immunoblot analysis with
an anti-HA mAb (data not shown). Molecular size markers are indicated

VP-16-mediated DNA damage by p21Waf1/Cip1 expression. It was
equally induced in both mock- and 1–309 akt-transfected cells
and was not inhibited by Z-Asp-CH2-DCB. No change was
observed in the expression level of PDK1. Because 1–229 and
1–267 Akt had little effects on apoptosis induction (Fig. 5D), the
apoptosis-inducing effect of 1–309 Akt might be the result of the
detachment of endogenous Akt from Hsp90 but not of the
dominant-negative effects of PH domain in 1–309 Akt. These
results indicate that Hsp90 binding to Akt protects cells from
undergoing apoptosis by preserving phospho-Akt level and Akt
kinase activity.
Inhibition of Akt-Hsp90b Binding Increased Akt Dephosphorylation
Catalyzed by PP2A. The balance between phosphorylation and
dephosphorylation might determine the amount of phospho-
Akt. There are two possibilities for the mechanism by which
inhibition of Akt binding to Hsp90b decreased the amount of
phospho-Akt: first, Akt binding to Hsp90b promotes PDK1-
mediated Akt phosphorylation; second, binding to Hsp90b
protects Akt from PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation.
We first examined the Hsp90b-PDK1 binding. As shown in
Fig. 6A, PDK1 could bind to neither 1–635 nor DN-Hsp90b,
whereas Akt could bind to 1–635 Hsp90b. Thus, Hsp90 might
not affect the kinase activity of PDK1. Furthermore, overex-
pression of WT- and 1–309 Akt did not affect the PDK1 kinase
activity (Fig. 6B). This result was consistent with a previous
report that PDK1’s activity was unaffected by stimuli that
strongly activate Akt through PI(3)K (27). We then examined the
change of PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of Akt that either
formed a complex with Hsp90 or did not. 293T cells were
transfected with mock or 1–309 akt and were serum starved for
24 h, following incubation with serum-containing medium in the
presence of 500 nM phosphatase inhibitor Okadaic acid. As
shown in Fig. 6C, time-dependent Akt phosphorylation at Thr308
in vivo was equally observed whether Akt formed a complex with
Hsp90b (by mock transfection) or did not (by 1–309 akt trans-
fection). To confirm this result, we prepared Akt-Hsp90b com-
plex by immunoprecipitating Akt from 293T cells that were
incubated at 45°C or 37°C for 20 min. As shown in Fig. 6D, the
in vitro sensitivity of PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of Akt at
Thr308 was not affected whether the Akt formed a complex with
Fig. 5.
Induction of apoptosis by inhibiting Akt-Hsp90 binding. (A) 293T cells
were transfected with mock or the FLAG-tagged 1–309 akt. After transfection
for 24 h, the transfected cells were cultured for 24 h in serum-free medium or
medium containing 10% FBS. Then the nuclei of the cells were stained with
DAPI, as described in Materials and Methods. (B) 293T cells were treated as
described in A. The increase in the activity of caspase-3-like proteases (DEV-
Dase activity) was determined, as described in Materials and Methods. The
vertical bars represent SD value of triplicate determinations. (C) 293T cells
were transfected with mock or the FLAG-tagged 1–309 akt. After transfection
for 24 h, the medium was replaced with serum-free medium containing
vehicle (lanes 1 and 4), 30 mgyml of VP-16 (lanes 2 and 5), or 30 mgyml of VP-16
plus 100 mgyml of Z-Asp-CH2-DCB (lanes 3 and 6). Cells were further incubated
for 24 h and then harvested. The cell lysates were immunoblotted with the
indicated antibodies. The expression of the FLAG-tagged 1–309 Akt was
conﬁrmed by immunoblot analysis with an anti–FLAG M2 mAb (data not
shown). (D) 293T cells were transfected with mock or the indicated FLAG-
tagged plasmids. After transfection for 24 h, the medium was replaced with
serum-free medium containing 30 mgyml of VP-16. Cells were further incu-
bated for 24 h. The cell lysates were immunoblotted with the indicated
antibodies. Molecular size markers are indicated (in kDa).

Akt binding to Hsp90b does not promote the PDK1-mediated Akt
phosphorylation. (A) The (His)6-tagged human PDK1 or WT-murine akt was
transfected into 293T cells together with the FLAG-tagged 1–635 hsp90b
(1–635) or 534–724 hsp90b (DN). The immunoprecipitated (His)6-tagged pro-
teins and the cell lysates were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies.
(B) 293T cells were transfected with mock or the FLAG-tagged WT- or 1–309
akt. The cells were serum-starved for 24 h, and then the cell lysates were
incubated with a protein G agarose conjugated with a control IgG (Control) or
an anti-PDK1 pAb (PDK1). The PDK1 kinase activity was estimated, as de-
scribed in Materials and Methods. The vertical bars represent SD value of
triplicate determinations. The amount of the immunoprecipitated PDK1 pro-
teins was estimated by performing Western blot analysis with an anti-PDK1
mAb. The expression of transfected FLAG-tagged WT- or 1–309 Akt was
conﬁrmed by immunoblot analysis with an anti-FLAG M2 mAb (data not
shown). (C) Mock or the FLAG-tagged 1–309 akt was transfected into 293T cells
together with the HA-tagged WT-akt. The cells were serum-starved for 24 h,
and then the medium was replaced with medium containing 10% FBS and 500
nM Okadaic acid. At the indicated time points, cells were harvested and the
cell lysates were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. (D) The FLAG-
tagged WT-akt and the V5-tagged WT-hsp90b were cotransfected into 293T
cells. The cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then incubated at 37°C or 45°C
for 20 min. The FLAG-tagged WT-Akt was immunoprecipitated and incubated
in vitro with the indicated amount of active human PDK1 in the presence (1)
or absence (2) of lipid vesicles containing PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 at 30°C for 30 min.
The reactions were electrophoresed and immunoblotted with the indicated
antibodies. The expression of transfected WT-Akt and Hsp90b was conﬁrmed
by immunoblot of the cell lysates with an anti-FLAG M2 mAb and an anti-V5
mAb, respectively (data not shown). Molecular size markers are indicated

Hsp90b (by incubation at 45°C) or not (by incubation at 37°C).
Therefore, suppression of PDK1-mediated phosphorylation of
Akt might not be the reason for Akt dephosphorylation after
blocking the Akt-Hsp90b complex formation.
To examine the second possibility that the Akt binding to
Hsp90b would affect PP2A-mediated Akt dephosphorylation,
we examined the change of phospho-Akt level in 293T cells
expressing 1–309 Akt after incubation with the PI(3)K inhibitor
LY294002. The addition of 10 mM LY294002 decreased the
phospho-Akt levels in 1–309 akt-transfected but not in mock-
transfected 293T cells (Fig. 7A). Decrease in phospho-Akt levels
was observed in both mock- and 1–309 akt-transfected 293T cells
when cells were treated with 50 mM LY294002. When cells were
serum starved, Akt was dephosphorylated in a time-dependent
manner (Fig. 7B). Overexpression of 1–309 Akt resulted in the
rapid dephosphorylation of Akt. The addition of 500 nM Oka-
daic acid rescued Akt from dephosphorylation. These results
indicate that blocking the Akt-Hsp90b complex formation pro-
motes PP2A-mediated Akt dephosphorylation.
We then try to confirm the increased sensitivity of freed Akt
to PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation. Incubation with 6.25 and
12.5 mU purified human PP2A in vitro decreased the amount of
phospho-Akt prepared from 1–309 akt-transfected but not from
mock-transfected 293T cells (Fig. 7C). The PP2A-induced de-
phosphorylation was inhibited by adding 1 mM Okadaic acid.
We, thus, concluded that detaching Akt from Hsp90b increased
the sensitivity to PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation. These
results indicate that Hsp90b binding to Akt may increase the
amount of phospho-Akt and induce Akt activation by protecting
it from PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation rather than by pro-
moting PDK1-mediated phosphorylation.
Discussion
After stimulation with growth factors and cytokines, PI(3)K was
activated, and the activated PI(3)K generated PtdIns(3,4,5)P3.
Then Akt was recruited to the plasma membrane and was
phosphorylated
at
Thr308
and
Ser473
by
PDK1
in
a
PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-dependent manner (7–11). The activity of
serineythreonine-specific phosphatase PP2A has been reported
to inhibit Akt kinase activity (28). Thus, the balance between
PDK1-mediated phosphorylation and PP2A-mediated dephos-
phorylation might determine the Akt kinase activity in vivo.
However, the mechanism that determines the balance remains
unidentified.
Hsp90 is an abundant and highly conserved protein involved
in a diverse array of cellular processes. Deletion studies in yeast
have revealed that Hsp90 is essential for cell growth (20). In
contrast to other heat-shock proteins, Hsp90 is not required for
maturation or maintenance of most proteins in vivo. Most of the
identified cellular targets are signaling proteins. Hsp90 acts as a
chaperone for unstable signal transducers and keeps them poised
for activation until they are stabilized by conformational changes
associated with signal transduction. Our present results indicate
that Akt is also a substrate of Hsp90 (Fig. 1); it formed a complex
with Hsp90 (Fig. 3). Phosphorylation was not required for Akt
binding to Hsp90 because the conversion of phosphorylation
sites did not affect the binding to Hsp90 (Fig. 1C), and LY294002
did not affect the heat shock-induced Akt-Hsp90 complex
formation (Fig. 4D).
The Akt binding domain of Hsp90 was different from the
NH2-terminal domain responsible for binding to ATP, geldana-
mycin, unfolded proteins, and small peptides, or the COOH-
terminal oligomerization domain (29–31). Our findings were
supported by the fact that geldanamycin could not inhibit Akt
binding to Hsp90 (data not shown). The connecting middle
domain of Hsp90, where Akt could bind, was of variable length
and was missing bacterial Hsp90s. Thus, the middle domain has
been suggested to be involved in a function gain of eukaryotic
Hsp90s (31). The middle domain of Hsp90 might regulate the
cell growth and apoptosis by binding to Akt. This hypothesis was
strengthened by the observation that Escherichia coli Hsp90
(which lack the middle domain) could not suppress the decrease
in viability of hsp90(2y2) yeast strains (32).
Hsp90 was responsible for the stabilization of the phospho-
Akt because inhibition of Akt-Hsp90 binding resulted in Akt
dephosphorylation in vivo (Fig. 4 B and E), decrease in Akt
kinase activity (Fig. 4C), and induction of apoptosis (Fig. 5).
PDK1 might not be involved in the phospho-Akt level decrease
in 1–309 akt-transfected cells (Fig. 6 B–D). These observations
were supported by the fact that the PDK1’s consensus sequence
was T(FyL)CGT (in single-letter amino acid code) (27). PDK1
might phosphorylate Akt at Thr308 by recognizing the consensus
sequence 308TFCGT312. Because Akt bound to Hsp90 through its
amino acid residues 229–309, Hsp90 binding might not interfere
with the recognition and phosphorylation capability of PDK1.

Inhibition of Akt-Hsp90b complex formation promotes PP2A-
mediated Akt dephosphorylation. (A) The FLAG-tagged WT-akt was trans-
fected into 293T cells together with mock or the HA-tagged 1–309 akt. After
transfection for 24 h, cells were treated with 0, 10, or 50 mM LY294002 for 10
min. (B) Mock or the HA-tagged 1–309 akt was transfected into 293T cells
together with the FLAG-tagged WT-akt. After transfection for 24 h, the
medium was replaced with serum-free medium in the presence (1) or absence
(2) of 500 nM Okadaic acid. (A and B) At the indicated time points, the
FLAG-tagged WT-Akt was immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with the
indicated antibodies. The cell lysates were also immunoblotted with an an-
ti-HA mAb. (C) Mock or the HA-tagged 1–309 akt was transfected into 293T
cells together with V5-tagged WT-hsp90b and the FLAG-tagged WT-akt. The
FLAG-tagged WT-Akt was immunoprecipitated and incubated in vitro with
the indicated amount of puriﬁed human PP2A in the presence (1) or absence
(2) of 1 mM Okadaic acid at 30°C for 30 min. The reactions were electropho-
resed and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. Molecular size mark-
ers are indicated (in kDa).

Thus, detachment of Akt from Hsp90 might promote the
PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation of Akt. Two lines of evi-
dence support the assumption that PP2A was responsible for the
dephosphorylation of Akt. First, suppression of PI(3)K-
mediated phosphorylation by 10 mM LY294002 or by serum
withdrawal led to the rapid dephosphorylation of Akt, which was
detached from Hsp90 (Fig. 7 A and B); second, detachment of
Akt from Hsp90 increased the sensitivity to PP2A-mediated
dephosphorylation in vitro (Fig. 7C). Although the PP2A-
recognition sequence has not been clarified yet, the site might
overlap with the Hsp90 binding sequence (amino acid residues
229–309 in Akt).
When HT1080 cells were exposed to heat shock, Akt was
activated (Fig. 4D). The heat shock-induced Akt activation was
PI(3)K dependent (Fig. 4D), as reported previously (25). Thus,
the interaction of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, the product of the PI(3)K
reaction, with the PH domain of Akt and the recruiting Akt to
the plasma membrane might be a reason for the heat shock-
induced Akt activation; the Hsp90 binding to Akt could be
another reason. The fact that blocking the Akt-Hsp90 complex
formation suppressed the heat shock-induced phosphorylation
of Akt (Fig. 4E) indicates that inhibition of PP2A-mediated
dephosphorylation by Hsp90 might be the most important
reason for heat shock-induced Akt phosphorylation and
activation.
In conclusion, we found that Akt could bind to Hsp90 in vivo.
The formation of the Akt-Hsp90 complex stabilized the Akt
kinase activity and protected cells from undergoing apoptosis by
preventing phospho-Akt dephosphorylation that was catalyzed
by PP2A. Because Akt is known to be overexpressed in certain
human carcinomas, these results provide information that could
aid in developing chemotherapeutic approaches by preventing
anti-apoptotic Akt signaling pathway.
